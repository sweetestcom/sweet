    <p>The following is a conversation with Charles Isbell,</p>
<p>Dean of the College of Computing at Georgia Tech,</p>
<p>a researcher and educator in the field of artificial intelligence,</p>
<p>and someone who deeply thinks about what exactly is the field of computing and how do we teach it.</p>
<p>He also has a fascinatingly varied set of interests including music,</p>
<p>books, movies, sports, and history that make him especially fun to talk with.</p>
<p>When I first saw him speak, his charisma immediately took over the room,</p>
<p>and I had a stupid excited smile on my face,</p>
<p>and I knew I had to eventually talk to him on this podcast.</p>
<p>Quick mention of each sponsor, followed by some thoughts related to the episode.</p>
<p>First is Neuro, the maker of functional sugar free gum</p>
<p>and mints that I use to give my brain a quick caffeine boost.</p>
<p>Second is Decoding Digital, a podcast on tech and entrepreneurship</p>
<p>that I listen to and enjoy.</p>
<p>Third is Masterclass, online courses that I watch from some of the most amazing humans in history.</p>
<p>And finally, Cash App, the app I use to send money to friends for food and drinks.</p>
<p>Please check out these sponsors in the description to get a discount and to support this podcast.</p>
<p>As a side note, let me say that I&rsquo;m trying to make it so that the conversations with Charles,</p>
<p>Eric Weinstein, and Dan Carlin will be published before Americans vote for president on November 3rd.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing explicitly political in these conversations,</p>
<p>but they do touch on something in human nature that I hope can bring context to our difficult time,</p>
<p>and maybe, for a moment, allow us to empathize with people we disagree with.</p>
<p>With Eric, we talk about the nature of evil.</p>
<p>With Charles, besides AI and music, we talk a bit about race in America,</p>
<p>and how we can bring more love and empathy to our online communication.</p>
<p>And with Dan Carlin, well, we talk about Alexander the Great,</p>
<p>Genghis Khan, Hitler, Stalin, and all the complicated parts of human history in between,</p>
<p>with a hopeful eye toward a brighter future for our humble, little civilization here on Earth.</p>
<p>The conversation with Dan will hopefully be posted tomorrow, on Monday, November 2nd.</p>

<p>And now, here&rsquo;s my conversation with Charles Isbell.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve mentioned that you love movies and TV shows.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s ask an easy question, but you have to be definitively, objectively, conclusive.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your top three movies of all time?</p>
<p>So, you&rsquo;re asking me to be definitive and to be conclusive.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a little hard. I&rsquo;m going to tell you why.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very simple. It&rsquo;s because movies is too broad of a category.</p>
<p>I got to pick subgenres, but I will tell you that of those genres,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll pick one or two from each of the genres, and I&rsquo;ll get us to three, so I&rsquo;m going to cheat.</p>
<p>So, my favorite comedy of all times, which is probably my favorite movie of all time,</p>
<p>is His Girl Friday, which is probably a movie that you&rsquo;ve not ever heard of,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s based on a play called The Front Page from, I don&rsquo;t know, early 1900s.</p>
<p>And the movie is a fantastic film.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the story? What&rsquo;s the independent film?</p>
<p>No, no, no. What are we talking about?</p>
<p>This is one of the movies that would have been very popular. It&rsquo;s a screwball comedy.</p>
<p>You ever see Moonlighting, the TV show? You know what I&rsquo;m talking about?</p>
<p>So, you&rsquo;ve seen these shows where there&rsquo;s a man and a woman, and they clearly are in love with one another,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re constantly fighting and always talking over each other.</p>
<p>Banter, banter, banter, banter, banter.</p>
<p>This was the movie that started all that, as far as I&rsquo;m concerned.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very much of its time. So, it&rsquo;s, I don&rsquo;t know, must have come out sometime between 1934 and 1939.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure exactly when the movie itself came out. It&rsquo;s black and white.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a fantastic film, and it&rsquo;s hilarious.</p>
<p>So, it&rsquo;s mostly conversation?</p>
<p>Not entirely, but mostly, mostly. Just a lot of back and forth.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a story there. Someone&rsquo;s on death row, and they&rsquo;re newspaper men, including her.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all newspaper men. They were divorced.</p>
<p>The editor, the publisher, I guess, and the reporter, they were divorced.</p>
<p>But, you know, they clearly, he&rsquo;s thinking, trying to get back together,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s this whole other thing that&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>But none of that matters. The plot doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s just a little play in conversation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fantastic. And I just love everything about the conversation, because at the end of the day,</p>
<p>sort of narrative and conversation are the sort of things that drive me.</p>
<p>And so, I really like that movie for that reason.</p>
<p>Similarly, I&rsquo;m now going to cheat, and I&rsquo;m going to give you two movies as one.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, and John Wick.</p>
<p>Both relatively modern. John Wick, of course.</p>
<p>One, two, or three?</p>
<p>One. It gets increasingly, I love them all for different reasons,</p>
<p>and increasingly more ridiculous. Kind of like Loving Alien and Aliens,</p>
<p>despite the fact they&rsquo;re two completely different movies.</p>
<p>But the reason I put Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, and John Wick together is because I</p>
<p>actually think they&rsquo;re the same movie, or what I like about them, the same movie.</p>
<p>Which is both of them create a world that you&rsquo;re coming in the middle of,</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t explain it to you. But the story is done so well that you pick it up.</p>
<p>So, anyone who&rsquo;s seen John Wick, you know, you have these little coins,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re headed out, and there are these rules,</p>
<p>and apparently every single person in New York City is an assassin.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s like two people who come through who aren&rsquo;t, but otherwise they are.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s this complicated world, and everyone knows each other.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t sit down and explain it to you, but you figure it out.</p>
<p>Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is a lot like that.</p>
<p>You get the feeling that this is chapter nine of a 10 part story,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve missed the first eight chapters, and they&rsquo;re not going to explain it to you,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s this sort of rich world behind you.</p>
<p>You get pulled in anyway, like immediately.</p>
<p>You get pulled in anyway. So, it&rsquo;s just excellent storytelling in both cases,</p>
<p>and very, very different.</p>
<p>And also you like the outfit, I assume? The John Wick outfit?</p>
<p>Oh yeah, of course. Well, of course. Yes. I think John Wick outfit is perfect.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s number two, and then‚Ä¶</p>
<p>But sorry to pause on that. Martial arts? You have a long list of hobbies.</p>
<p>Like it scrolls off the page, but I didn&rsquo;t see martial arts as one of them.</p>
<p>I do not do martial arts, but I certainly watch martial arts.</p>
<p>Oh, I appreciate it very much. Oh, we could talk about every Jackie Chan movie ever made,</p>
<p>and I would be on board with that.</p>
<p>The Shower, too? Like that kind of comedy of a cop?</p>
<p>Yes, yes. By the way, my favorite Jackie Chan movie would be Drunken Master 2,</p>
<p>known in the States usually as Legend of the Drunken Master.</p>
<p>Actually, Drunken Master, the first one, is the first kung fu movie I ever saw,</p>
<p>but I did not know that.</p>
<p>First Jackie Chan movie?</p>
<p>No, first one ever that I saw and remember, but I had no idea that that&rsquo;s what it was,</p>
<p>and I didn&rsquo;t know that was Jackie Chan. That was like his first major movie.</p>
<p>Yeah. I was a kid. It was done in the 70s.</p>
<p>I only later rediscovered that that was actually.</p>
<p>And he creates his own martial art by drinking. Was he actually drinking or was he played drinking?</p>
<p>You mean as an actor or as a character?</p>
<p>No. I&rsquo;m sure as an actor. He was in the 70s or whatever.</p>
<p>He was definitely drinking, and in the end, he drinks industrial grade alcohol.</p>
<p>Ah, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, and has one of the most fantastic fights ever in that subgenre.</p>
<p>Anyway, that&rsquo;s my favorite one of his movies, but I&rsquo;ll tell you the last movie.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually a movie called Nothing But a Man, which is the 1960s,</p>
<p>starred Ivan Dixon, who you&rsquo;ll know from Hogan&rsquo;s Heroes, and Abby Lincoln.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a really small little drama. It&rsquo;s a beautiful story.</p>
<p>But my favorite scenes, I&rsquo;m cheating, one of my favorite movies just for the ending is The</p>
<p>Godfather. I think the last scene of that is just fantastic. It&rsquo;s the whole movie all summarized in</p>
<p>just eight, nine seconds.</p>
<p>Godfather Part One?</p>
<p>Part One.</p>
<p>How does it end? I don&rsquo;t think you need to worry about spoilers if you haven&rsquo;t seen The Godfather.</p>
<p>Spoiler alert. It ends with the wife coming to Michael, and he says,</p>
<p>just this once, I&rsquo;ll let you ask me my business. And she asks him if he did this terrible thing,</p>
<p>and he looks her in the eye and he lies, and he says, no. And she says, thank you. And she</p>
<p>walks out the door, and you see her going out of the door, and all these people are coming in,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re kissing Michael&rsquo;s hands, and Godfather. And then the camera switches</p>
<p>perspective. So instead of looking at him, you&rsquo;re looking at her, and the door</p>
<p>closes in her face, and that&rsquo;s the end of the movie. And that&rsquo;s the whole movie right there.</p>
<p>Do you see parallels between that and your position as Dean at Georgia Tech Chrome?</p>
<p>Just kidding. Trick question.</p>
<p>Sometimes, certainly. The door gets closed on me every once in a while.</p>
<p>Okay. That was a rhetorical question. You&rsquo;ve also mentioned that you, I think, enjoy all kinds of</p>
<p>experiments, including on yourself. But I saw a video where you said you did an experiment where</p>
<p>you tracked all kinds of information about yourself and a few others sort of wiring up your</p>
<p>home. And this little idea that you mentioned in that video, which is kind of interesting, that</p>
<p>you thought that two days worth of data is enough to capture majority of the behavior of the human</p>
<p>being. First, can you describe what the heck you did to collect all the data? Because it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>fascinating, just like little details of how you collect that data and also what your intuition</p>
<p>behind the two days is. So first off, it has to be the right two days. But I was thinking of a</p>
<p>very specific experiment. There&rsquo;s actually a suite of them that I&rsquo;ve been a part of, and other people</p>
<p>have done this, of course. I just sort of dabbled in that part of the world. But to be very clear,</p>
<p>the specific thing that I was talking about had to do with recording all the IR going on in my</p>
<p>infrared going on in my house. So this is a long time ago. So this is everything&rsquo;s being curled</p>
<p>by pressing buttons on remote controls, as opposed to speaking to Alexa or Siri or someone like that.</p>
<p>And I was just trying to figure out if you could get enough data on people to figure out what they</p>
<p>were going to do with their TVs or their lights. My house was completely wired up at the time.</p>
<p>But you know, what I&rsquo;m about to look at a movie, I&rsquo;m about to turn on the TV or whatever and just</p>
<p>see what I could predict from it. It was kind of surprising. It shouldn&rsquo;t have been. But that&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>very easy to do, by the way, just capturing all the little stuff. I mean, it&rsquo;s a bunch of computers</p>
<p>systems. It&rsquo;s really easy to capture today if you know what you&rsquo;re looking for. At Georgia Tech,</p>
<p>long before I got there, we had this thing called the Aware Home, where everything was wired up and</p>
<p>you captured everything that was going on. Nothing even difficult, not with video or anything like</p>
<p>that, just the way that the system was just capturing everything. So it turns out that,</p>
<p>and I did this with myself and then I had students and they worked with many other people. And it</p>
<p>turns out at the end of the day, people do the same things over and over and over again. So it</p>
<p>has to be the right two days, like a weekend. But it turns out not only can you predict what</p>
<p>someone&rsquo;s going to do next at the level of what button they&rsquo;re going to press next on a remote</p>
<p>control, but you can do it with something really, really simple. You don&rsquo;t even need a hidden mark</p>
<p>off model. It&rsquo;s like a mark, just simply, I press this, this is my prediction of the next thing.</p>
<p>It turns out you can get 93% accuracy just by doing something very simple and stupid and just</p>
<p>counting statistics. But what was actually more interesting is that you could use that information.</p>
<p>This comes up again and again in my work. If you try to represent people or objects by the things</p>
<p>they do, the things you can measure about them that have to do with action in the world. So</p>
<p>distribution over actions, and you try to represent them by the distribution of actions that are done</p>
<p>on them, then you do a pretty good job of sort of understanding how people are and they cluster</p>
<p>remarkably well, in fact, irritatingly so. And so by clustering people this way,</p>
<p>you can maybe, you know, I got the 93% accuracy of what&rsquo;s the next button you&rsquo;re going to press,</p>
<p>but I can get 99% accuracy or somewhere there&rsquo;s about on the collections of things you might</p>
<p>press. And it turns out the things that you might press are all related to number to each other and</p>
<p>exactly what you would expect. So for example, all the key, all the numbers on a keypad, it turns out</p>
<p>all have the same behavior with respect to you as a human being. And so you would naturally cluster</p>
<p>them together and you discover that numbers are all related to one another in some way and all</p>
<p>these other things. And then, and here&rsquo;s the part that I think is important. I mean, you can see</p>
<p>this in all kinds of things. Every individual is different, but any given individual is remarkably</p>
<p>predictable because you keep doing the same things over and over again. And the two things that I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>learned in the long time that I&rsquo;ve been thinking about this is people are easily predictable and</p>
<p>people hate when you tell them that they&rsquo;re easily predictable, but they are. And there you go.</p>
<p>Yeah. What about, let me play devil&rsquo;s advocate and philosophically speaking, is it possible to</p>
<p>say that what defines humans is the outlier. So even though many, some large percentage of our</p>
<p>behaviors, whatever the signal we measure is the same and it would cluster nicely, but maybe it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the special moments of when we break out of the routine is the definitive thing that we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>breaking out of the routine is the definitive things. And the way we break out of that routine</p>
<p>for each one of us might be different. It&rsquo;s possible. I would say that I would say it a</p>
<p>little differently. I think I would make two things. One is a, I&rsquo;m going to disagree with</p>
<p>the premise, I think, but that&rsquo;s fine. I think the way I would put it is there are people who</p>
<p>are very different from lots of other people, but they&rsquo;re not 0%, they&rsquo;re closer to 10%, right? So</p>
<p>in fact, even if you do this kind of clustering of people, that&rsquo;ll turn out to be the small number</p>
<p>they all behave like each other, even if they individually behave very differently from everyone</p>
<p>else. So I think that&rsquo;s kind of important. But what you&rsquo;re really asking, I think, and I think</p>
<p>this is really a question is, what do you do when you&rsquo;re faced with the situation you&rsquo;ve never seen</p>
<p>before? What do you do when you&rsquo;re faced with an extraordinary situation maybe you&rsquo;ve seen others</p>
<p>do and you&rsquo;re actually forced to do something and you react to that very differently. And that is</p>
<p>the thing that makes you human. I would agree with that, at least at a philosophical level, that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the times when you are faced with something difficult, a decision that you have to make</p>
<p>where the answer isn&rsquo;t easy, even if you know what the right answer is, that&rsquo;s sort of what defines</p>
<p>you as the individual. And I think what defines people broadly, it&rsquo;s the hard problem. It&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>the easy problem. It&rsquo;s the thing that&rsquo;s going to hurt you. It&rsquo;s not even that it&rsquo;s difficult. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just that you know that the outcome is going to be highly suboptimal for you. And I do think that</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a reasonable place to start for the question of what makes us human. So before we talk about</p>
<p>sort of explore the different ideas underlying interactive artificial intelligence, which we</p>
<p>are working on, let me just go along this thread to skip to kind of our world of social media,</p>
<p>which is something that at least on the artificial intelligence side you think about.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a popular narrative, I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s true, but that we have these silos in social</p>
<p>media and we have these clusterings, as you&rsquo;re kind of mentioning. And the idea is that, you know,</p>
<p>along that narrative is that, you know, we want to, we want to break each other out of those silos</p>
<p>so we can be empathetic to other people, to if you&rsquo;re a Democrat, you&rsquo;d be empathetic to the</p>
<p>Republican. If you&rsquo;re Republican, you&rsquo;re empathetic Democrat. Those are just two silly bins that we</p>
<p>seem to be very excited about, but there&rsquo;s other binnings that we can think about. Is there, from</p>
<p>an artificial intelligence perspective, because you&rsquo;re just saying we cluster along the data,</p>
<p>but then interactive artificial intelligence is referring to throwing agents into that mix,</p>
<p>AI systems in that mix, helping us interacting with us humans and maybe getting us out of that</p>
<p>mix, maybe getting us out of those silos. Is that something that you think is possible? Do you see</p>
<p>a hopeful possibility for artificial intelligence systems in these large networks of people to get</p>
<p>us outside of our habits in at least the idea space to where we can sort of be empathetic to</p>
<p>other people&rsquo;s lived experiences, other people&rsquo;s points of view, you know, all that kind of stuff?</p>
<p>Yes, and I actually don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s that hard. Well, it&rsquo;s not hard in this sense. So imagine that</p>
<p>you can, let&rsquo;s just, let&rsquo;s make life simple for a minute. Let&rsquo;s assume that you can do a kind of</p>
<p>partial ordering over ideas or clusterings of behavior. It doesn&rsquo;t even matter what I mean here,</p>
<p>so long as there&rsquo;s some way that this is a cluster, this is a cluster, there&rsquo;s some edge</p>
<p>between them, right? And this is kind of, they don&rsquo;t quite touch even, or maybe they come very</p>
<p>close. If you can imagine that conceptually, then the way you get from here to here is not by going</p>
<p>from here to here. The way you get from here to here is you find the edge and you move slowly</p>
<p>together, right? And I think that machines are actually very good at that sort of thing once we</p>
<p>can kind of define the problem, either in terms of behavior or ideas or words or whatever. So it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>easy in the sense that if you already have the network and you know the relationships, you know,</p>
<p>the edges and sort of the strengths on them and you kind of have some semantic meaning for them,</p>
<p>the machine doesn&rsquo;t have to, you do as the designer, then yeah, I think you can kind of move</p>
<p>people along and sort of expand them. But it&rsquo;s harder than that. And the reason it&rsquo;s harder than</p>
<p>that, or sort of coming up with the network structure itself is hard, is because I&rsquo;m gonna</p>
<p>tell you a story that someone else told me and I don&rsquo;t, I may get some of the details a little bit</p>
<p>wrong, but it&rsquo;s roughly, it roughly goes like this. You take two sets of people from the same</p>
<p>backgrounds and you want them to solve a problem. So you separate them up, which we do all the time,</p>
<p>right? Oh, you know, we&rsquo;re gonna break out in the, we&rsquo;re gonna break out groups. You&rsquo;re gonna go</p>
<p>over there and you&rsquo;re gonna talk about this. You&rsquo;re gonna go over there and you&rsquo;re gonna talk</p>
<p>about this. And then you have them sort of in this big room, but far apart from one another,</p>
<p>and you have them sort of interact with one another. When they come back to talk about what</p>
<p>they learn, you want to merge what they&rsquo;ve done together. It can be extremely hard because they</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t, they basically don&rsquo;t speak the same language anymore. Like when you create these problems and</p>
<p>you dive into them, you create your own language. So the example this one person gave me, which I</p>
<p>found kind of interesting because we were in the middle of that at the time, was</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re sitting over there and they&rsquo;re talking about these rooms that you can see, but you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>seeing them from different vantage points, depending on what side of the room you&rsquo;re on.</p>
<p>They can see a clock very easily. And so they start referring to the room as the one with the clock.</p>
<p>This group over here, looking at the same room, they can see the clock, but it&rsquo;s, you know,</p>
<p>not in their line of sight or whatever. So they end up referring to it by some other way.</p>
<p>When they get back together and they&rsquo;re talking about things, they&rsquo;re referring to the same room</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t even realize they&rsquo;re referring to the same room. And in fact, this group doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>even see that there&rsquo;s a clock there and this group doesn&rsquo;t see whatever&rsquo;s the clock on the wall is</p>
<p>the thing that stuck with me. So if you create these different silos, the problem isn&rsquo;t that</p>
<p>the ideologies disagree. It&rsquo;s that you&rsquo;re using the same words and they mean radically different</p>
<p>things. The hard part is just getting them to agree on the, well, maybe we&rsquo;d say the axioms in</p>
<p>our world, right? But you know, just get them to agree on some basic definitions because right now</p>
<p>they talk, they&rsquo;re talking past each other, just completely talking past each other. That&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>hard part, getting them to meet, getting them to interact. That may not be that difficult. Getting</p>
<p>them to see where their language is leading them to lead past one another. That&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s the hard</p>
<p>part. It&rsquo;s a really interesting question to me. It could be on the layer of language, but it feels</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s multiple layers to this. Like it could be worldview. It could be, I mean, all boils</p>
<p>down to empathy, being able to put yourself in the shoes of the other person to learn the language, to</p>
<p>learn like visually how they see the world, to learn like the, I mean, I experienced this now</p>
<p>with, with trolls, the, the degree of humor in that world. For example, I talk about love a lot.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very like, I&rsquo;m really lucky to have this amazing community of loving people. But whenever I</p>
<p>encounter trolls, they always roll their eyes at the idea of love because it&rsquo;s so quote unquote</p>
<p>cringe. So, so they, they show love by like derision, I would say. And I think about on the</p>
<p>human level, that&rsquo;s a whole nother discussion. That&rsquo;s psychology, that&rsquo;s sociology, so on. But</p>
<p>I wonder if AI systems can help somehow and to bridge the gap of what is this person&rsquo;s life like?</p>
<p>Encourage me to just ask that question, to put myself in their shoes, to experience the agitations,</p>
<p>the fears, the hopes they have, the, to experience, you know, the, to even just to think about what</p>
<p>was their upbringing like, like having a, a single parent home or a shitty education or all those</p>
<p>kinds of things, just to put myself in that mind space. It feels like that&rsquo;s really important.</p>
<p>For us to, to, to bring those clusters together, to find that similar language. But it&rsquo;s unclear</p>
<p>how AI can help that because it seems like AI systems need to understand both parties first.</p>
<p>So the, you know, the word understand, there&rsquo;s doing a lot of work, right?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So do you have to understand it or do you just simply have to note that there is something</p>
<p>similar as a point to touch, right? So, you know, you use the word empathy and I like that word,</p>
<p>for a lot of reasons, I think you&rsquo;re right in the way that you&rsquo;re using in the ways you&rsquo;re describing,</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s separate it from sympathy, right? So, you know, sympathy is feeling sort of for someone,</p>
<p>empathy is kind of understanding where they&rsquo;re coming from and how they, how they feel, right?</p>
<p>And for most people, those things go hand in hand. For some people, some are very good at empathy</p>
<p>and very, very bad at sympathy. Some people cannot experience, well, my observation would be,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a psychologist, my observation would be that some people seem to be very, very,</p>
<p>very bad at sympathy. My observation would be that some people seem incapable of feeling sympathy</p>
<p>unless they feel empathy first. You can understand someone, understand where they&rsquo;re coming from and</p>
<p>still think, no, I can&rsquo;t support that, right? It doesn&rsquo;t mean that the only way I, because if that,</p>
<p>if that isn&rsquo;t the case, then what it requires is that you, you must, the only way that you can,</p>
<p>to understand someone means you must agree with everything that they do, which isn&rsquo;t right, right?</p>
<p>I can feel for someone is to completely understand them and make them like me in some way. Well,</p>
<p>then we&rsquo;re lost, right? Because we&rsquo;re not all exactly like each other. I have to understand</p>
<p>everything that you&rsquo;ve gone through. It helps clearly, but they&rsquo;re separable ideas, right?</p>
<p>Even though they get clearly, clearly tangled up in one another. So what I think AI could help you</p>
<p>do actually is if, and you know, I&rsquo;m, I&rsquo;m being quite fanciful as it were, but if you, if you</p>
<p>think of these as kind of, I understand how you interact, the words that you use, the, you know,</p>
<p>the actions you take, I have some way of doing this. Let&rsquo;s not worry about what that is.</p>
<p>But I can see you as a kind of distribution of experiences and actions taken upon you,</p>
<p>things you&rsquo;ve done and so on. And I can do this with someone else and I can find the places where</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some kind of commonality, a mapping as it were, even if it&rsquo;s not total, you know, the,</p>
<p>if I think of this as distribution, right, then, you know, I can take the cosine of the angle</p>
<p>between you and if it&rsquo;s, you know, if it&rsquo;s zero, you&rsquo;ve got nothing in common. If it&rsquo;s one,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re completely the same person. Well, you know, you&rsquo;re probably not one. You&rsquo;re almost certainly</p>
<p>not zero. I can find the place where there&rsquo;s the overlap, then I might be able to introduce you on</p>
<p>that basis or connect you in that, connect you in that way and make it easier for you to take that</p>
<p>step of that step of empathy. It&rsquo;s not, it&rsquo;s not impossible to do. Although I wonder if it requires</p>
<p>that everyone involved is at least interested in asking the question. So maybe the hard part</p>
<p>is just getting them interested in asking the question. In fact, maybe if you can get them to</p>
<p>ask the question, how are we more alike than we are different, they&rsquo;ll solve it themselves. Maybe</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the problem that AI should be working on, not telling you how you&rsquo;re similar or different,</p>
<p>but just getting you to decide that it&rsquo;s worthwhile asking the question. It feels like an economist&rsquo;s</p>
<p>answer actually. Well, people, okay, first of all, people like would disagree. So let me disagree</p>
<p>slightly, which is, I think everything you said is brilliant, but I tend to believe philosophically</p>
<p>speaking that people are interested underneath it all. And I would say that AI, the, the possibility</p>
<p>that an AI system would show the commonality is incredible. That&rsquo;s a really good starting point.</p>
<p>I would say if you, if on social media, I could discover the common things deep or shallow between</p>
<p>me and a person who there&rsquo;s tension with, I think that my basic human nature would take over from</p>
<p>there. And I think enjoy that commonality. And like, there&rsquo;s something sticky about that, that</p>
<p>my mind will linger on and that person in my mind will become like warmer and warmer. And like, I&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>start to give a feel more and more compassion towards them. I think for majority of the</p>
<p>population, that&rsquo;s true, but that might be, that&rsquo;s a hypothesis. Yeah. I mean, it&rsquo;s an empirical</p>
<p>question, right? You&rsquo;d have to figure it out. I mean, I want to believe you&rsquo;re right. And so I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>going to say that I think you&rsquo;re right. Of course, some people come to those things for the purpose</p>
<p>of trolling, right? And it doesn&rsquo;t matter that they&rsquo;re playing a different game. Yeah. But I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know. I, you know, my experience is it requires two things. It requires, in fact, maybe</p>
<p>this is really at the end what you&rsquo;re saying. And I, and I do agree with this for sure. So</p>
<p>you, it&rsquo;s hard to hold onto that kind of anger or to hold onto just the desire to humiliate someone</p>
<p>for that long. It&rsquo;s just difficult to do. It takes, it takes a toll on you. But more importantly,</p>
<p>we know this both from people having done studies on it, but also from our own experiences,</p>
<p>that it is much easier to be dismissive of a person if they&rsquo;re not in front of you,</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re not real, right? So much of the history of the world is about making people other, right?</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re social media, if you&rsquo;re on the web, if you&rsquo;re doing whatever in the internet,</p>
<p>but being forced to deal with someone as a person, some equivalent to being in the same room,</p>
<p>makes a huge difference. Cause then you&rsquo;re one, you&rsquo;re forced to deal with their humanity because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s in front of you. The other is of course that, you know, they might punch you in the face</p>
<p>if you go too far. So, you know, both of those things kind of work together, I think to the,</p>
<p>to the right end. So I think bringing people together is really a kind of substitute for</p>
<p>forcing them to see the humanity in another person and to not be able to treat them as bits,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard to troll someone when you&rsquo;re looking them in the eye. This is very difficult to do.</p>
<p>Agreed. Your broad set of research interests fall under interactive AI, as I mentioned,</p>
<p>which is a fascinating set of ideas and you have some concrete things that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>particularly interested in, but maybe could you talk about how you think about the field of</p>
<p>interactive artificial intelligence? Sure. So let me say upfront that if you look at,</p>
<p>certainly my early work, but even if you look at most of it, I&rsquo;m a machine learning guy,</p>
<p>right? I do machine learning. First paper ever published, it was in NIPS. Back then it was</p>
<p>NIPS. Now it&rsquo;s NeurIPS. It&rsquo;s a long story there. Anyway, that&rsquo;s another thing. But so,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m a machine learning guy, right? I believe in data, I believe in statistics and all those</p>
<p>kinds of things. And the reason I&rsquo;m bringing that up is even though I&rsquo;m a newfangled statistical</p>
<p>machine learning guy and have been for a very long time, the problem I really care about is AI,</p>
<p>right? I care about artificial intelligence. I care about building some kind of</p>
<p>intelligent artifact. However that gets expressed, that would be at least as intelligent as humans</p>
<p>and as interesting as humans, perhaps in their own way. So that&rsquo;s the deep underlying love and</p>
<p>dream is the bigger AI. Whatever the heck that is. Yeah. The machine learning in some ways is</p>
<p>a means to the end. It is not the end. And I don&rsquo;t understand how one could be intelligent</p>
<p>without learning. So therefore I got to figure out how to do that, right? So that&rsquo;s important.</p>
<p>But machine learning, by the way, is also a tool. I said statistical, because that&rsquo;s what most</p>
<p>people think of themselves as machine learning people. That&rsquo;s how they think. I think Pat Langley</p>
<p>might disagree, or at least 1980s Pat Langley might disagree with what it takes to do machine</p>
<p>learning. But I care about the AI problem, which is why it&rsquo;s interactive AI, not just interactive</p>
<p>ML. I think it&rsquo;s important to understand that there&rsquo;s a longterm goal here, which I will</p>
<p>probably never live to see, but I would love to have been a part of, which is building something</p>
<p>truly intelligent outside of ourselves. Can we take a tiny tangent? Or am I interrupting,</p>
<p>which is, is there something you can say concrete about the mysterious gap between</p>
<p>the subset ML and the bigger AI? What&rsquo;s missing? What do you think? I mean, obviously it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>totally unknown, not totally, but in part unknown at this time, but is it something like with Pat</p>
<p>Langley, is it knowledge, like expert system reasoning type of kind of thing?</p>
<p>So AI is bigger than ML, but ML is bigger than AI. This is kind of the real problem here,</p>
<p>is that they&rsquo;re really overlapping things that are really interested in slightly different problems.</p>
<p>I tend to think of ML, and there are many people out there who are going to be very upset at me</p>
<p>about this, but I tend to think of ML being much more concerned with the engineering of solving a</p>
<p>problem, and AI about the sort of more philosophical goal of true intelligence. And that&rsquo;s the thing</p>
<p>that motivates me, even if I end up finding myself living in this kind of engineering ish space,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve now made Michael Jordan upset. But to me, they just feel very different. You&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>measuring them differently, your goals of where you&rsquo;re trying to be are somewhat different.</p>
<p>But to me, AI is about trying to build that intelligent thing. And typically, but not always,</p>
<p>for the purpose of understanding ourselves a little bit better. Machine learning is, I think,</p>
<p>trying to solve the problem, whatever that problem is. Now, that&rsquo;s my take. Others, of course,</p>
<p>would disagree. So on that note, so with the interactive AI, do you tend to, in your mind,</p>
<p>visualize AI as a singular system, or is it as a collective huge amount of systems interacting</p>
<p>with each other? Like, is the social interaction of us humans and of AI systems the fundamental</p>
<p>to intelligence? I think, well, it&rsquo;s certainly fundamental to our kind of intelligence, right?</p>
<p>And I actually think it matters quite a bit. So the reason the interactive AI part matters to me</p>
<p>is because I don&rsquo;t, this is going to sound simple, but I don&rsquo;t care whether a tree makes a sound</p>
<p>when it falls and there&rsquo;s no one around, because I don&rsquo;t think it matters, right? If there&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>observer in some sense. And I think what&rsquo;s interesting about the way that we&rsquo;re intelligent</p>
<p>is we&rsquo;re intelligent with other people, right? Or other things anyway. And we go out of our way to</p>
<p>make other things intelligent. We&rsquo;re hardwired to find intention, even whether there is no intention,</p>
<p>why we anthropomorphize everything. I think the interactive AI part is being intelligent in and</p>
<p>of myself in isolation is a meaningless act in some sense. The correct answer is you have to</p>
<p>be intelligent in the way that you interact with others. It&rsquo;s also efficient because it allows you</p>
<p>to learn faster because you can import from past history. It also allows you to be efficient in</p>
<p>the transmission of that. So we ask ourselves about me. Am I intelligent? Clearly, I think so.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m also intelligent as a part of a larger species and group of people, and we&rsquo;re trying to</p>
<p>move the species forward as well. And so I think that notion of being intelligent with others is</p>
<p>kind of the key thing because otherwise you come and you go, and then it doesn&rsquo;t matter. And so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why I care about that aspect of it. And it has lots of other implications. One is not just</p>
<p>building something intelligent with others, but understanding that you can&rsquo;t always communicate</p>
<p>with those others. They have been in a room where there&rsquo;s a clock on the wall that you haven&rsquo;t seen,</p>
<p>which means you have to spend an enormous amount of time communicating with one another constantly</p>
<p>in order to figure out what each other wants. So this is why people project, right? You project your</p>
<p>own intentions and your own reasons for doing things on the others as a way of understanding</p>
<p>them so that you know how to behave. But by the way, you, completely predictable person,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how you&rsquo;re predictable. I don&rsquo;t know you well enough, but you probably eat the same five</p>
<p>things over and over again or whatever it is that you do, right? I know I do. If I&rsquo;m going to a new</p>
<p>Chinese restaurant, I will get general gals chicken because that&rsquo;s the thing that&rsquo;s easy.</p>
<p>I will get hot and sour soup. People do the things that they do, but other people get the chicken and</p>
<p>broccoli. I can push this analogy way too far. The chicken and broccoli. I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>wrong with those people. I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s wrong with them either. We have all had our trauma.</p>
<p>So they get their chicken and broccoli and their egg drop soup or whatever. We got to communicate and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to change, right? So interactive AI is not just about learning to solve a problem or a</p>
<p>task. It&rsquo;s about having to adapt that over time, over a very long period of time and interacting</p>
<p>with other people who will themselves change. This is what we mean about things like adaptable</p>
<p>models, right? That you have to have a model. That model is going to change. And by the way,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not just the case that you&rsquo;re different from that person, but you&rsquo;re different from the person</p>
<p>you were 15 minutes ago or certainly 15 years ago. And I have to assume that you&rsquo;re at least going</p>
<p>to drift, hopefully not too many discontinuities, but you&rsquo;re going to drift over time. And I have</p>
<p>to have some mechanism for adapting to that as you and an individual over time and across individuals</p>
<p>over time. On the topic of adaptive modeling and you talk about lifelong learning, which is</p>
<p>a, I think a topic that&rsquo;s understudied or maybe because nobody knows what to do with it. But like,</p>
<p>you know, if you look at Alexa or most of our artificial intelligence systems that are primarily</p>
<p>machine learning based systems or dialogue systems, all those kinds of things, they know very little</p>
<p>about you in the sense of the lifelong learning sense that we learn as humans, we learn a lot about</p>
<p>each other, not in the quantity effects, but like the temporally rich set of information that seems</p>
<p>to like pick up the crumbs along the way that somehow seems to capture a person pretty well.</p>
<p>Do you have any ideas how to do lifelong learning? Because it seems like most of the machine learning</p>
<p>community does not. No, well, by the way, not only does the machine learning community not spend a</p>
<p>lot of time on lifelong learning, I don&rsquo;t think they spend a lot of time on learning period in</p>
<p>the sense that they tend to be very task focused. Everybody is overfitting to whatever problem is</p>
<p>they happen to have. They&rsquo;re overengineering their solutions to the task. Even the people,</p>
<p>and I think these people too, are trying to solve a hard problem of transfer learning, right? I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>going to learn on one task and learn another task. You still end up creating the task. It&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>looking for your keys where the light is because that&rsquo;s where the light is, right? It&rsquo;s not because</p>
<p>the keys have to be there. I mean, one could argue that we tend to do this in general. As a group,</p>
<p>we tend to hill climb and get stuck in local optima. I think we do this in the small as well.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s very hard to do. Here&rsquo;s the hard thing about AI. The hard thing about AI is it</p>
<p>keeps changing on us, right? What is AI? AI is the art and science of making computers act the way</p>
<p>they do in the movies, right? That&rsquo;s what it is, right? But beyond that. They keep coming up with</p>
<p>new movies. Yes. Right, exactly. We are driven by this kind of need to the ineffable quality of who</p>
<p>we are, which means that the moment you understand something is no longer AI, right? Well, we</p>
<p>understand this. That&rsquo;s just you take the derivative and you divide by two and then you average it out</p>
<p>over time in the window. Therefore, that&rsquo;s no longer AI. The problem is unsolvable because</p>
<p>it keeps kind of going away. This creates a kind of illusion, which I don&rsquo;t think is an entire</p>
<p>illusion, of either there&rsquo;s very simple task based things you can do very well and over engineer,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s all of AI, and there&rsquo;s nothing in the middle. It&rsquo;s very hard to get from here to here,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s very hard to see how to get from here to here. I don&rsquo;t think that we&rsquo;ve done</p>
<p>a very good job of it because we get stuck trying to solve the small problems in front of it,</p>
<p>myself included. I&rsquo;m not going to pretend that I&rsquo;m better at this than anyone else. Of course,</p>
<p>all the incentives in academia and in industry are set to make that very hard because you have</p>
<p>to get the next paper out, you have to get the next product out, you have to solve this problem,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s very sort of naturally incremental. None of the incentives are set up to allow you to take</p>
<p>a huge risk unless you&rsquo;re already so well established you can take that big risk.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re that well established that you can take that big risk, then you&rsquo;ve probably spent</p>
<p>much of your career taking these little risks, relatively speaking, and so you have got a</p>
<p>lifetime of experience telling you not to take that particular big risk. So the whole system&rsquo;s</p>
<p>set up to make progress very slow. That&rsquo;s fine. It&rsquo;s just the way it is, but it does make this</p>
<p>gap seem really big, which is my long way of saying I don&rsquo;t have a great answer to it except</p>
<p>that stop doing n equals one. At least try to get n equal two and maybe n equal seven so that you</p>
<p>can say I&rsquo;m going to, or maybe t is a better variable here. I&rsquo;m going to not just solve this</p>
<p>problem and solve this problem and another problem. I&rsquo;m not going to learn just on you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to keep living out there in the world and just seeing what happens and that we&rsquo;ll learn</p>
<p>something as designers and our machine learning algorithms and our AI algorithms can learn as</p>
<p>well. But unless you&rsquo;re willing to build a system which you&rsquo;re going to have live for months at a</p>
<p>time in an environment that is messy and chaotic, you cannot control, then you&rsquo;re never going to</p>
<p>make progress in that direction. So I guess my answer to you is yes. My idea is that you should,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not no, it&rsquo;s yes. You should be deploying these things and making them live for a month</p>
<p>at a time and be okay with the fact that it&rsquo;s going to take you five years to do this. Not</p>
<p>rerunning the same experiment over and over again and refining the machine so it&rsquo;s slightly better</p>
<p>at whatever, but actually having it out there and living in the chaos of the world and seeing what</p>
<p>its learning algorithm say can learn, what data structure it can build and how it can go from</p>
<p>there. Without that, you&rsquo;re going to be stuck all the time. What do you think about the possibility</p>
<p>of N equals one growing, it&rsquo;s probably crude approximation, but growing like if you look at</p>
<p>language models like GPT3, if you just make it big enough, it&rsquo;ll swallow the world. Meaning like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll solve all your T to infinity by just growing in size of this, taking the small overengineered</p>
<p>solution and just pumping it full of steroids in terms of compute, in terms of size of training</p>
<p>data and the Yann LeCun style self supervised or open AI self supervised. Just throw all of YouTube</p>
<p>at it and it will learn how to reason, how to paint, how to create music, how to love all that</p>
<p>by watching YouTube videos. I mean, I can&rsquo;t think of a more terrifying world to live in than a world</p>
<p>that is based on YouTube videos, but yeah, I think the answer that I just kind of don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>quite well, it won&rsquo;t work that easily. You will get somewhere and you will learn something, which</p>
<p>means it&rsquo;s probably worth it, but you won&rsquo;t get there. You won&rsquo;t solve the problem. Here&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>thing, we build these things and we say we want them to learn, but what actually happens, and</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say they do learn, I mean, certainly every paper I&rsquo;ve gotten published, the things learn,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know about anyone else, but they actually change us, right? We react to it differently,</p>
<p>right? So we keep redefining what it means to be successful, both in the negative in the case,</p>
<p>but also in the positive in that, oh, well, this is an accomplishment. I&rsquo;ll give you an example,</p>
<p>which is like the one you just described with YouTube. Let&rsquo;s get completely out of machine</p>
<p>learning. Well, not completely, but mostly out of machine learning. Think about Google.</p>
<p>People were trying to solve information retrieval, the ad hoc information retrieval</p>
<p>problem forever. I mean, first major book I ever read about it was what, 71, I think it was when</p>
<p>it came out. Anyway, we&rsquo;ll treat everything as a vector and we&rsquo;ll do these vector space models</p>
<p>and whatever. And that was all great. And we made very little progress. I mean, we made some progress</p>
<p>and then Google comes and makes the ad hoc problem seem pretty easy. I mean, it&rsquo;s not,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s lots of computers and databases involved, and there&rsquo;s some brilliant algorithmic stuff</p>
<p>behind it too, and some systems building. But the problem changed, right?</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve got a world that&rsquo;s that connected so that you have, you know, there are 10 million</p>
<p>answers quite literally to the question that you&rsquo;re asking, then the problem wasn&rsquo;t give me</p>
<p>the things that are relevant. The problem is don&rsquo;t give me anything that&rsquo;s irrelevant, at least in</p>
<p>the first page, because nothing else matters. So Google is not solving the information retrieval</p>
<p>problem, at least not on this webpage. Google is minimizing false positives, which is not the same</p>
<p>thing as getting an answer. It turns out it&rsquo;s good enough for what it is we want to use Google for,</p>
<p>but it also changes what the problem was we thought we were trying to solve in the first place.</p>
<p>You thought you were trying to find an answer, but you&rsquo;re not, or you&rsquo;re trying to find the answer,</p>
<p>but it turns out you&rsquo;re just trying to find an answer. Now, yes, it is true. It&rsquo;s also very good</p>
<p>at finding you exactly that webpage. Of course, you trained yourself to figure out what the keywords</p>
<p>were to get you that webpage. But in the end, by having that much data, you&rsquo;ve just changed the</p>
<p>problem into something else. You haven&rsquo;t actually learned what you set out to learn. Now, the</p>
<p>counter to that would be maybe we&rsquo;re not doing that either. We just think we are because, you know,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re in our own heads. Maybe we&rsquo;re learning the wrong problem in the first place, but I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think that matters. I think the point is that Google has not solved information retrieval.</p>
<p>Google has done amazing service. I have nothing bad to say about what they&rsquo;ve done. Lord knows</p>
<p>my entire life is better because Google exists. For Google Maps, I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever found</p>
<p>this place. Where is this? I see 110 and I see where did 95 go? So I&rsquo;m very grateful for Google,</p>
<p>but they just have to make certain the first five things are right.</p>
<p>And everything after that is wrong. Look, we&rsquo;re going off on a totally different topic here, but</p>
<p>think about the way we hire faculty. It&rsquo;s exactly the same thing.</p>
<p>I get in controversial, getting controversial. It&rsquo;s exactly the same problem, right? It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>minimizing false positives. We say things like we want to find the best person to be an assistant</p>
<p>professor at MIT in the new college of computing, which I will point out was founded 30 years after</p>
<p>the college of computing. I&rsquo;m a part of both of my alma mater. I&rsquo;m just saying I appreciate all</p>
<p>that they did and all that they&rsquo;re doing. Anyway, so we&rsquo;re going to try to hire the best professor.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what we say, the best person for this job, but that&rsquo;s not what we do at all, right?</p>
<p>Do you know which percentage of faculty in the top four earn their PhDs from the top four,</p>
<p>say in 2017, which is the most recent year for which I have data?</p>
<p>Maybe a large percentage.</p>
<p>About 60%.</p>
<p>60.</p>
<p>60% of the faculty in the top four earn their PhDs in the top four. This is computer science,</p>
<p>for which there is no top five. There&rsquo;s only a top four, right? Because they&rsquo;re all tied for one.</p>
<p>For people who don&rsquo;t know, by the way, that would be MIT Stanford, Berkeley, CMU.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>Georgia Tech is number eight.</p>
<p>Number eight. You&rsquo;re keeping track.</p>
<p>Oh yes. It&rsquo;s a large part of my job. Number five is Illinois. Number six is a tie with</p>
<p>UW and Cornell and Princeton and Georgia Tech are tied for eight and UT Austin is number 10.</p>
<p>Michigan is number 11, by the way. So if you look at the top 10, you know what percentage of</p>
<p>faculty in the top 10 earn their PhDs from the top 10? 65, roughly. 65%.</p>
<p>If you look at the top 55 ranked departments, 50% of the faculty earn their PhDs from the top 10.</p>
<p>There is no universe in which all the best faculty, even just for R1 universities,</p>
<p>the majority of them come from 10 places. There&rsquo;s no way that&rsquo;s true, especially when you consider</p>
<p>how small some of those universities are in terms of the number of PhDs they produce.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Now that&rsquo;s not a negative. I mean, it is a negative. It also has a habit of entrenching</p>
<p>certain historical inequities and accidents. But what it tells you is, well, ask yourself the</p>
<p>question, why is it like that? Well, because it&rsquo;s easier. If we go all the way back to the 1980s,</p>
<p>you know, there was a saying that nobody ever lost his job buying a computer from IBM,</p>
<p>and it was true. And nobody ever lost their job hiring a PhD from MIT, right? If the person turned</p>
<p>out to be terrible, well, you know, they came from MIT, what did you expect me to know?</p>
<p>However, that same person coming from pick whichever is your least favorite place that</p>
<p>produces PhDs in, say, computer science, well, you took a risk, right? So all the incentives,</p>
<p>particularly because you&rsquo;re only going to hire one this year, well, now we&rsquo;re hiring 10,</p>
<p>but you know, you&rsquo;re only going to have one or two or three this year. And by the way,</p>
<p>when they come in, you&rsquo;re stuck with them for at least seven years at most places,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s before you know whether they&rsquo;re getting tenure or not. And if they get tenure,</p>
<p>stuck with them for a good 30 years, unless they decide to leave. That means the pressure to get</p>
<p>this right is very high. So what are you going to do? You&rsquo;re going to minimize false positives.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t care about saying no inappropriately. You only care about saying yes inappropriately.</p>
<p>So all the pressure drives you into that particular direction. Google,</p>
<p>not to put too fine a point on it, was in exactly the same situation with their search. It turns out</p>
<p>you just don&rsquo;t want to give people the wrong page in the first three or four pages. And if there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>10 million right answers and 100 bazillion wrong answers, just make certain the wrong answers</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t get up there. And who cares if you, the right answer was actually the 13th page. A right</p>
<p>answer, a satisficing answer is number one, two, three, or four. So who cares?</p>
<p>Or an answer that will make you discover something beautiful, profound to your question.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s a different problem, right?</p>
<p>But isn&rsquo;t that the problem? Can we linger on this topic without sort of walking with grace?</p>
<p>How do we get for hiring faculty, how do we get that 13th page with a truly special person? Like</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s, I mean, it depends on the department. Computer science probably has those department,</p>
<p>those kinds of people. Like you have the Russian guy, Grigory Perlman, like just these awkward,</p>
<p>strange minds that don&rsquo;t know how to play the little game of etiquette that faculty have all</p>
<p>agreed somehow like converged over the decades, how to play with each other. And also is not,</p>
<p>you know, on top of that is not from the top four, top whatever numbers, the schools. And maybe</p>
<p>actually just says a few every once in a while to the traditions of old within the computer science</p>
<p>community. Maybe talks trash about machine learning is a total waste of time. And that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>there on their resume. So like how do you allow the system to give those folks a chance?</p>
<p>Well, you have to be willing to take a certain kind of, without taking a particular position</p>
<p>on any particular person, you&rsquo;d have to take, you have to be willing to take risk, right? A small</p>
<p>amount of it. I mean, if we were treating this as a, well, as a machine learning problem, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a search problem, which is what it is. It&rsquo;s a search problem. If we were treating it that</p>
<p>way, you would say, oh, well, the main thing is you want, you know, you&rsquo;ve got a prior,</p>
<p>you want some data because I&rsquo;m Bayesian. If you don&rsquo;t want to do it that way,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll just inject some randomness in and it&rsquo;ll be okay. The problem is that feels very,</p>
<p>very hard to do with people. All the incentives are wrong there. But it turns out, and let&rsquo;s say,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say that&rsquo;s the right answer. Let&rsquo;s just give for the sake of argument that, you know,</p>
<p>injecting randomness in the system at that level for who you hire is just not worth doing because</p>
<p>the price is too high or the cost is too high. If we had infinite resources, sure, but we don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And also you&rsquo;ve got to teach people. So, you know, you&rsquo;re ruining other people&rsquo;s lives if you get it</p>
<p>too wrong. But we&rsquo;ve taken that principle, even if I grant it and pushed it all the way back, right?</p>
<p>So, we could have a better pool than we have of people we look at and give an opportunity to.</p>
<p>If we do that, then we have a better chance of finding that. Of course, that just pushes the</p>
<p>problem back another level. But let me tell you something else. You know, I did a sort of study,</p>
<p>I call it a study. I called up eight of my friends and asked them for all of their data for</p>
<p>graduate admissions. But then someone else followed up and did an actual study. And it</p>
<p>turns out that I can tell you how everybody gets into grad school more or less, more or less.</p>
<p>You basically admit everyone from places higher ranked than you. You admit most people from</p>
<p>places ranked around you. And you meant almost no one from places ranked below you, with the</p>
<p>exception of the small liberal arts colleges that aren&rsquo;t ranked at all, like Harvey Mudd,</p>
<p>because they don&rsquo;t have a PhD, so they aren&rsquo;t ranked. This is all CS. Which means the decision</p>
<p>of whether you become a professor at Cornell was determined when you were 17, by what you knew to</p>
<p>go to undergrad to do whatever. So if we can push these things back a little bit and just make the</p>
<p>pool a little bit bigger, at least you raise the probability that you will be able to see someone</p>
<p>interesting and take the risk. The other answer to that question, by the way, which you could argue</p>
<p>is the same as you either adjust the pool so the probabilities go up, that&rsquo;s a way of injecting a</p>
<p>little bit of uniform noise in the system, as it were, is you change your loss function.</p>
<p>You just let yourself be measured by something other than whatever it is that we&rsquo;re measuring</p>
<p>ourselves by now. I mean, US News and World Report, every time they change their formula</p>
<p>for determining rankings, move entire universities to behave differently, because rankings matter.</p>
<p>TITO Can you talk trash about those rankings for a second? No, I&rsquo;m joking about talking trash.</p>
<p>I actually, it&rsquo;s so funny how from my perspective, from a very shallow perspective,</p>
<p>how dogmatic, like how much I trust those rankings. They&rsquo;re almost ingrained in my head.</p>
<p>I mean, at MIT, everybody kind of, it&rsquo;s a propagated, mutually agreed upon</p>
<p>TITO idea that those rankings matter. And I don&rsquo;t think anyone knows what they&rsquo;re,</p>
<p>like, most people don&rsquo;t know what they&rsquo;re based on. And what are they exactly based on? And what</p>
<p>are the flaws in that? TITO Well, so it depends on which rankings you&rsquo;re talking about. Do you</p>
<p>want to talk about computer science or talk about universities? TITO Computer science, US News,</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t that the main one? TITO Yeah, the only one that matters is US News. Nothing else matters.</p>
<p>Sorry, CSRankings.org, but nothing else matters but US News. So US News has formula that it uses</p>
<p>for many things, but not for computer science because computer science is considered a science,</p>
<p>which is absurd. So the rankings for computer science is 100% reputation. So two people</p>
<p>at each department, it&rsquo;s not really department, whatever, at each department,</p>
<p>basically rank everybody. Slightly more complicated than that, but whatever, they rank everyone. And</p>
<p>then those things are put together and somehow. TITO So that means how do you improve reputation?</p>
<p>How do you move up and down the space of reputation? TITO Yes, that&rsquo;s exactly the</p>
<p>question. TITO Twitter? TITO It can help. I can tell you how Georgia Tech did it,</p>
<p>or at least how I think Georgia Tech did it, because Georgia Tech is actually the case to</p>
<p>look at. Not just because I&rsquo;m at Georgia Tech, but because Georgia Tech is the only computing unit</p>
<p>that was not in the top 20 that has made it into the top 10. It&rsquo;s also the only one in the last</p>
<p>two decades, I think, that moved up in the top 10, as opposed to having someone else moved down.</p>
<p>So we used to be number 10, and then we became number nine because UT Austin went down slightly,</p>
<p>and now we were tied for ninth because that&rsquo;s how rankings work. And we moved from nine to eight</p>
<p>because our raw score moved up a point. So something about Georgia Tech, computer science,</p>
<p>or computing anyway. I think it&rsquo;s because we have shown leadership at every crisis level, right? So</p>
<p>we created a college, first public university to do it, second college, second university to do it</p>
<p>after CMU is number one. I also think it&rsquo;s no accident that CMU is the largest and we&rsquo;re,</p>
<p>depending upon how you count and depending on exactly where MIT ends up with its final college</p>
<p>of computing, second or third largest. I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s an accident. We&rsquo;ve been doing this</p>
<p>for a long time. But in the 2000s when there was a crisis about undergraduate education,</p>
<p>Georgia Tech took a big risk and succeeded at rethinking undergrad education and computing.</p>
<p>I think we created these schools at a time when most public universities anyway were afraid to</p>
<p>do it. We did the online masters and that mattered because people were trying to figure out what to</p>
<p>do with MOOCs and so on. I think it&rsquo;s about being observed by your peers and having an impact. So,</p>
<p>I mean, that is what reputation is, right? So the way you move up in the reputation rankings is by</p>
<p>doing something that makes people turn and look at you and say, that&rsquo;s good. They&rsquo;re better than I</p>
<p>thought. Beyond that, it&rsquo;s just inertia and there&rsquo;s huge hysteresis in the system, right? I mean,</p>
<p>there was these, I can&rsquo;t remember this, this may be apocryphal, but there&rsquo;s a major or department</p>
<p>that MIT was ranked number one in and they didn&rsquo;t have it. It&rsquo;s just about what you&hellip; I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>if that&rsquo;s true, but someone said that to me anyway. But it&rsquo;s a thing, right? It&rsquo;s all about</p>
<p>reputation. Of course, MIT is great because MIT is great. It&rsquo;s always been great. By the way,</p>
<p>because MIT is great, the best students come, which keeps it being great. I mean,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just a positive feedback loop. It&rsquo;s not surprising. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s wrong.</p>
<p>Yeah. But it&rsquo;s almost like a narrative. It doesn&rsquo;t actually have to be backed by reality. Not to</p>
<p>say anything about MIT, but it does feel like we&rsquo;re playing in the space of narratives, not the</p>
<p>space of something grounded. One of the surprising things when I showed up at MIT and just all the</p>
<p>students I&rsquo;ve worked with and all the research I&rsquo;ve done is they&rsquo;re the same people as I&rsquo;ve met</p>
<p>at other places. I mean, what MIT has going for it&hellip; Well, MIT has many things going for it. One</p>
<p>of the things MIT has going for it is&hellip; Nice logo?</p>
<p>Is nice logo. It&rsquo;s a lot better than it was when I was here. Nice colors too. Terrible,</p>
<p>terrible name for a mascot. But the thing that MIT has going for it is it really does get the</p>
<p>best students. It just doesn&rsquo;t get all of the best students. There are many more best students out</p>
<p>there. And the best students want to be here because it&rsquo;s the best place to be or one of the</p>
<p>best places to be. And it&rsquo;s a sort of positive feedback. But you said something earlier,</p>
<p>which I think is worth examining for a moment. I forget the word you used. You said,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re living in the space of narrative as opposed to something objective.</p>
<p>Narrative is objective. I mean, one could argue that the only thing that we do as humans is</p>
<p>narrative. We just build stories to explain why we do what we do. Someone once asked me,</p>
<p>but wait, there&rsquo;s nothing objective. No, it&rsquo;s completely an objective measure.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an objective measure of the opinions of everybody else. Now, is that physics? I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know. Tell me something you think is actually objective and measurable in a way that makes</p>
<p>sense. Cameras, they don&rsquo;t&hellip; You&rsquo;re getting me off on something here, but do you know that</p>
<p>cameras, which are just reflecting light and putting them on film, did not work for dark</p>
<p>skin people until the 1970s? You know why? Because you were building cameras for the people who were</p>
<p>going to buy cameras, who all, at least in the United States and Western Europe, were relatively</p>
<p>light skin. Turns out it took terrible pictures of people who look like me. That got fixed with</p>
<p>better film and whole processes. Do you know why? Because furniture manufacturers wanted to be able</p>
<p>to take pictures of mahogany furniture, right? Because candy manufacturers wanted to be able</p>
<p>to take pictures of chocolate. Now, the reason I bring that up is because you might think that</p>
<p>cameras are objective. They&rsquo;re just capturing light. No, they&rsquo;re doing the things that they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing based upon decisions by real human beings to privilege, if I may use that word, some physics</p>
<p>over others, because it&rsquo;s an engineering problem. There are tradeoffs, right? So I can either worry</p>
<p>about this part of the spectrum or this part of the spectrum. This costs more. That costs less.</p>
<p>This costs the same, but I have more people paying money over here, right? And it turns out that</p>
<p>if a giant conglomerate demands that you do something different and it&rsquo;s going to involve</p>
<p>all kinds of money for you, suddenly the tradeoffs change, right? And so there you go. I actually</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know how I ended up there. Oh, it&rsquo;s because of this notion of objectiveness, right? So even</p>
<p>the objective isn&rsquo;t objective because at the end you&rsquo;ve got to tell a story. You&rsquo;ve got to make</p>
<p>decisions. You&rsquo;ve got to make tradeoff. What else is engineering other than that? So I think that</p>
<p>the rankings capture something. They just don&rsquo;t necessarily capture what people assume they</p>
<p>capture. You know, just to linger on this idea, why is there not more people who just like play</p>
<p>with whatever that narrative is, have fun with it, have like excite the world, whether it&rsquo;s in</p>
<p>the Carl Sagan style of like that calm, sexy voice of explaining the stars and all the romantic stuff</p>
<p>or the Elon Musk, dare I even say Donald Trump, where you&rsquo;re like trolling and shaking up the</p>
<p>system and just saying controversial things. I talked to Lisa Feldman Barrett, who&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>neuroscientist who just enjoys playing the controversy. Things like finds the counter</p>
<p>intuitive ideas in the particular science and throws them out there and sees how they play in</p>
<p>the public discourse. Like why don&rsquo;t we see more of that? And why doesn&rsquo;t academia attract an Elon</p>
<p>Musk type? Well, tenure is a powerful thing that allows you to do whatever you want, but getting</p>
<p>tenure typically requires you to be relatively narrow, right? Because people are judging you.</p>
<p>Well, I think the answer is we have told ourselves a story, a narrative that is vulgar,</p>
<p>what you just described is vulgar. It&rsquo;s certainly unscientific, right? And it is easy to convince</p>
<p>yourself that in some ways you&rsquo;re the mathematician, right? The fewer there are in your major,</p>
<p>the more that proves your purity, right? So once you tell yourself that story, then it is</p>
<p>beneath you to do that kind of thing, right? I think that&rsquo;s wrong. I think that, and by the way,</p>
<p>everyone doesn&rsquo;t have to do this. Everyone&rsquo;s not good at it. And everyone, even if they would be</p>
<p>good at it, would enjoy it. So it&rsquo;s fine. But I do think you need some diversity in the way that</p>
<p>people choose to relate to the world as academics, because I think the great universities are ones</p>
<p>that engage with the rest of the world. It is a home for public intellectuals. And in 2020,</p>
<p>being a public intellectual probably means being on Twitter. Whereas of course that wasn&rsquo;t true</p>
<p>20 years ago, because Twitter wasn&rsquo;t around 20 years ago. And if it was, it wasn&rsquo;t around in a</p>
<p>meaningful way. I don&rsquo;t actually know how long Twitter has been around. As I get older, I find</p>
<p>that my notion of time has gotten worse and worse. Like Google really has been around that long?</p>
<p>Anyway, the point is that I think that we sometimes forget that a part of our job is to</p>
<p>impact the people who aren&rsquo;t in the world that we&rsquo;re in, and that that&rsquo;s the point of being at</p>
<p>a great place and being a great person, frankly. There&rsquo;s an interesting force in terms of public</p>
<p>intellectuals. Forget Twitter, we could look at just online courses that are public facing in</p>
<p>some part. There is a kind of force that pulls you back. Let me just call it out because I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>give a damn at this point. There&rsquo;s a little bit of, all of us have this, but certainly faculty</p>
<p>have this, which is jealousy. Whoever&rsquo;s popular at being a good communicator, exciting the world</p>
<p>with their science. And of course, when you excite the world with the science, it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>peer reviewed, clean. It all sounds like bullshit. It&rsquo;s like a Ted talk and people roll their eyes</p>
<p>and they hate that a Ted talk gets millions of views or something like that. And then everybody</p>
<p>pulls each other back. There&rsquo;s this force that just kind of, it&rsquo;s hard to stand out unless you</p>
<p>win a Nobel prize or whatever. It&rsquo;s only when you get senior enough where you just stop giving a</p>
<p>damn. But just like you said, even when you get tenure, that was always the surprising thing to</p>
<p>me. I have many colleagues and friends who have gotten tenure, but there&rsquo;s not a switch.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not an F you money switch where you&rsquo;re like, you know what? Now I&rsquo;m going to be more</p>
<p>bold. It doesn&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t see it. Well, there&rsquo;s a reason for that. Tenure isn&rsquo;t a test. It&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>training process. It teaches you to behave in a certain way, to think in a certain way, to accept</p>
<p>certain values and to react accordingly. And the better you are at that, the more likely you are to</p>
<p>earn tenure. And by the way, this is not a bad thing. Most things are like that. And I think most</p>
<p>of my colleagues are interested in doing great work and they&rsquo;re just having impact in the way that</p>
<p>they want to have impact. I do think that as a field, not just as a field, as a profession,</p>
<p>we have a habit of belittling those who are popular as it were, as if the word itself is a</p>
<p>kind of Scarlet A, right? I think it&rsquo;s easy to convince yourself, and no one is immune to this,</p>
<p>no one is immune to this, that the people who are better known are better known for bad reasons.</p>
<p>The people who are out there dumbing it down are not being pure to whatever the values and ethos</p>
<p>is for your field. And it&rsquo;s just very easy to do. Now, having said that, I think that ultimately,</p>
<p>people who are able to be popular and out there and are touching the world and making a difference,</p>
<p>you know, our colleagues do, in fact, appreciate that in the long run. It&rsquo;s just, you know,</p>
<p>you have to be very good at it or you have to be very interested in pursuing it. And once you get</p>
<p>past a certain level, I think people accept that for who it is. I mean, I don&rsquo;t know. I&rsquo;d be really</p>
<p>interested in how Rod Brooks felt about how people were interacting with him when he did Fast,</p>
<p>Cheap, and Out of Control way, way, way back when.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s Fast, Cheap, and Out of Control?</p>
<p>It was a documentary that involved four people. I remember nothing about it other than Rod Brooks</p>
<p>was in it and something about naked mole rats. I can&rsquo;t remember what the other two things were.</p>
<p>It was robots, naked mole rats, and then two others.</p>
<p>By the way, Rod Brooks used to be the head of the artificial intelligence laboratory at MIT</p>
<p>and then launched, I think, iRobot and then Think Robotics, Rethink Robotics.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Think is in the word. And also is a little bit of a rock star personality in the AI world,</p>
<p>a very opinionated, very intelligent. Anyway, sorry, mole rats and naked.</p>
<p>Naked mole rats. Also, he was one of my two advisors for my PhD.</p>
<p>This explains a lot.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how to explain it. I love Rod. But I also love my other advisor, Paul. Paul,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re listening, I love you too. Both very, very different people.</p>
<p>Paul Viola.</p>
<p>Paul Viola. Both very interesting people, very different in many ways. But I don&rsquo;t know what</p>
<p>Rod would say to you about what the reaction was. I know that for the students at the time,</p>
<p>because I was a student at the time, it was amazing. This guy was in a movie, being very</p>
<p>much himself. Actually, the movie version of him is a little bit more Rod than Rod. I think they</p>
<p>edited it appropriately for him. But it was very much Rod. And he did all this while doing great</p>
<p>work. Was he running the iLab at that point or not? I don&rsquo;t know. But anyway, he was running</p>
<p>the iLab, or would be soon. He was a giant in the field. He did amazing things, made a lot of his</p>
<p>bones by doing the kind of counterintuitive science. And saying, no, you&rsquo;re doing this all</p>
<p>wrong. Representation is crazy. The world is your own representation. You just react to it. I mean,</p>
<p>these are amazing things. And continues to do those sorts of things as he&rsquo;s moved on.</p>
<p>I think he might tell you, I don&rsquo;t know if he would tell you it was good or bad, but I know that</p>
<p>for everyone else out there in the world, it was a good thing. And certainly,</p>
<p>he continued to be respected. So it&rsquo;s not as if it destroyed his career by being popular.</p>
<p>P stands for probabilistic. And what does</p>
<p>FUNC stand for? So a lot of my life is about making acronyms. So if I have one quirk,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s that people will say words and I see if they make acronyms. And if they do, then I&rsquo;m happy. And</p>
<p>then if they don&rsquo;t, I try to change it so that they make acronyms. It&rsquo;s just a thing that I do.</p>
<p>So PFUNC is an acronym. It has three or four different meanings. But finally, I decided that</p>
<p>the P stands for probabilistic because at the end of the day, it&rsquo;s machine learning and it&rsquo;s randomness and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s fun.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a sense to it, which is not an acronym, like literally FUNC. You have a dark, mysterious past.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a sense to it, which is not an acronym, like literally FUNC.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a sense to it, which is not an acronym, like literally FUNC.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a whole set of things of which rap is a part. So tagging is a part of hip hop. I don&rsquo;t know why</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s true, but people tell me it&rsquo;s true and I&rsquo;m willing to go along with it because they get very</p>
<p>angry about it. But hip hop is like graffiti. Tagging is like graffiti. And there&rsquo;s all these,</p>
<p>including the popping and the locking and all the dancing and all those things. That&rsquo;s all a part of</p>
<p>hip hop. It&rsquo;s a way of life, which I think is true. And then there&rsquo;s rap, which is this particular.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the music part.</p>
<p>Yes. A music part. I mean, you wouldn&rsquo;t call the stuff that DJs do the scratching. That&rsquo;s not rap,</p>
<p>right? But it&rsquo;s a part of hip hop, right? So given that we understand that hip hop is this whole</p>
<p>thing, what are the rap albums that best touch that for me? Well, if I were going to educate you,</p>
<p>I would try to figure out what you liked and then I would work you there.</p>
<p>Oh my God. I would probably start with, there&rsquo;s a fascinating exercise one can do by watching old</p>
<p>episodes of I love the seventies. I love the eighties. I love the nineties with a bunch of</p>
<p>friends and just see where people come in and out of pop culture. So if you&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>those people, then I would actually start you with where I would hope to start you with anyway,</p>
<p>which is public enemy. Particularly it takes a nation of millions to hold us back, which is</p>
<p>clearly the best album ever produced. And certainly the best hip hop album ever produced</p>
<p>in part because it was so much of what was great about the time. Fantastic lyrics is me. It&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>about the lyrics. Amazing music that was coming from Rick Rubin was the producer of that. And he</p>
<p>did a lot, very kind of heavy mental ish, at least in the eighties sense at the time. And it was</p>
<p>focused on politics in the 1980s, which was what made hip hop so great. Then I would start you</p>
<p>there. Then I would move you up through things that are been happening more recently. I&rsquo;d probably</p>
<p>get you to someone like a most deaf. I would give you a history lesson, basically. Most of them.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s amazing. He hosted a poetry jam thing on HBO or something like that. Probably. I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think I&rsquo;ve seen it, but I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised. Yeah. Spoken poetry. That&rsquo;s amazing. He&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>And then I would, I, after I got you there, I&rsquo;d work you back to EPMD.</p>
<p>And eventually I would take you back to the last poets and particularly the first album,</p>
<p>the last poets, which was 1970 to give you a sense of history and that it actually has been building</p>
<p>up over a very, very long time. So we would start there because that&rsquo;s where your music aligns. And</p>
<p>then we would cycle out and I&rsquo;d move you to the present. And then I&rsquo;d take you back to the past.</p>
<p>Because I think a large part of people who are kind of confused about any kind of music,</p>
<p>you know, the truth is this is the same thing we&rsquo;ve always been talking about, right? It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>about narrative and being a part of something and being immersed in something. So you understand it,</p>
<p>right? Jazz, which I also like is one of the things that&rsquo;s cool about jazz is that you come</p>
<p>and you meet someone who&rsquo;s talking to you about jazz and you have no idea what they&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about. And then one day it all clicks and you&rsquo;ve been so immersed in it. You go, oh yeah, that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>Charlie Parker. You start using words that nobody else understands, right? And it becomes part of</p>
<p>hip hop&rsquo;s the same way. Everything&rsquo;s the same way. They&rsquo;re all cultural artifacts, but I would help</p>
<p>you to see that there&rsquo;s a history of it and how it connects to other genres of music that you might</p>
<p>like to bring you in. So that you could kind of see how it connects to what you already like,</p>
<p>including some of the good work that&rsquo;s been done with fusions of hip hop and bluegrass.</p>
<p>Oh no.</p>
<p>Yes. Some of it&rsquo;s even good. Not all of it, but some of it is good,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;d start you with, it takes a nation of millions to hold this back.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an interesting tradition in like more modern hip hop of integrating almost like classic</p>
<p>crock songs or whatever, like integrating into their music, into the beat, into the whatever.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of interesting. It gives a whole new, not just classic crock, but what is it?</p>
<p>Kanye with Gold Digger.</p>
<p>Old R&amp;B.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s taking and pulling old R&amp;B, right?</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s been true since the beginning. I mean, in fact, that&rsquo;s in some ways,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why the DJ used to get top billing because it was the DJ that brought all the records together</p>
<p>and made it worth so that people could dance. You go back to those days, mostly in New York,</p>
<p>though not exclusively, but mostly in New York where it sort of came out of,</p>
<p>the DJ that brought all the music together and the beats and showed that basically music is</p>
<p>itself an instrument, very meta, and you can bring it together and then you sort of wrap over it and</p>
<p>so on. And it moved that way. So that&rsquo;s going way, way back. Now, in the period of time where I grew</p>
<p>up, when I became really into it, which was mostly the 80s, it was more funk was the back for a lot</p>
<p>of the stuff, Public Enemy at that time, notwithstanding. And so, which is very nice</p>
<p>because it tied into what my parents listened to and what I vaguely remember listening to when I</p>
<p>was very small. And by the way, complete revival of George Clinton and Parliament and Funkadelic</p>
<p>and all of those things to bring it sort of back into the 80s and into the 90s. And as we go on,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to see the last decade and the decade before that being brought in.</p>
<p>And when you don&rsquo;t think that you&rsquo;re hearing something you&rsquo;ve heard, it&rsquo;s probably because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s being sampled by someone who, referring to something they remembered when they were young,</p>
<p>perhaps from somewhere else altogether. And you just didn&rsquo;t realize what it was because it wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>a popular song where you happened to grow up. So this stuff has been going on for a long time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of the things that I think is beautiful. Run DMC, Jam Master Jay used to play, he played</p>
<p>piano. He would record himself playing piano and then sample that to make it a part of what was</p>
<p>going on rather than play the piano. That&rsquo;s how his mind can think. Well, it&rsquo;s pieces. You&rsquo;re</p>
<p>putting pieces together, you&rsquo;re putting pieces of music together to create new music, right?</p>
<p>Now that doesn&rsquo;t mean that the root, I mean, the roots are doing their own thing.</p>
<p>Yeah. Right. Those, those are, that&rsquo;s a whole. Yeah. But still it&rsquo;s the right attitude that,</p>
<p>you know, and what else is jazz, right? Jazz is about putting pieces together and then putting</p>
<p>your own spin on it. It&rsquo;s all the same. It&rsquo;s all the same thing. It&rsquo;s all the same thing.</p>
<p>Yeah. Cause you mentioned lyrics. It does make me sad. Again, this is me talking trash about</p>
<p>modern hip hop. I haven&rsquo;t, you know, investigated. I&rsquo;m sure people correct me that there&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>great artists. That&rsquo;s part of the reason I&rsquo;m saying it is they&rsquo;ll leave it in the comments that you</p>
<p>should listen to this person is the lyrics went away from talking about maybe not just politics,</p>
<p>but life and so on. Like, you know, the kind of like protest songs, even if you look at like a</p>
<p>Bob Marley or you said Public Enemy or Rage Against the Machine, More on the Rockside,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s the place where we go to those lyrics. Like classic rock is all about like,</p>
<p>my woman left me or, or I&rsquo;m really happy that she&rsquo;s still with me or the flip side. It&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>love songs of different kinds. It&rsquo;s all love, but it&rsquo;s less political, like less interesting. I</p>
<p>would say in terms of like deep, profound knowledge. And it seems like rap is the place where you</p>
<p>would find that. And it&rsquo;s sad that for the most part, what I see, like you look like mumble rap</p>
<p>or whatever, they&rsquo;re moving away from lyrics and more towards the beat and the, and the musicality</p>
<p>of it. I&rsquo;ve always been a fan of the lyrics. In fact, if you go back and you read my reviews,</p>
<p>which I recently was rereading, man, I wrote my last review the month I graduated. I got my PhD,</p>
<p>which says something about something. I&rsquo;m not sure what though. I always would always,</p>
<p>but I often would start with, it&rsquo;s all about the lyrics. For me, it&rsquo;s all, it&rsquo;s about the lyrics.</p>
<p>Someone has already written in the comments before I&rsquo;ve even finished having this conversation</p>
<p>that, you know, neither of us knows what we&rsquo;re talking about and it&rsquo;s all in the underground</p>
<p>hip hop and here&rsquo;s who you should go listen to. And that is true. Every time I despair for popular</p>
<p>rap, I get someone points me to, or I discover some underground hip hop song and I&rsquo;m, I am made</p>
<p>happy and whole again. So I know it&rsquo;s out there. I don&rsquo;t listen to as much as I used to because</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m listening to podcasts and old music from the 1980s. It&rsquo;s a kind of no beat at all, but you know,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a little bit of sampling here and there. I&rsquo;m sure. By the way, James Brown is funk or no?</p>
<p>Yes. And so is junior Wells, by the way. Who&rsquo;s that? Oh, junior Wells, Chicago blues. He was</p>
<p>James Brown before James Brown was. It&rsquo;s hard to imagine somebody being James Brown. Go look up</p>
<p>hoodoo man blues, junior Wells, and just listen to, snatch it back and hold it and you&rsquo;ll see it.</p>
<p>And they were contemporaries. Where do you put like little Richard or all that kind of stuff?</p>
<p>Like Ray Charles, like when they get like, hit the road Jack and don&rsquo;t you come back. Isn&rsquo;t that</p>
<p>like, there&rsquo;s a funkiness in it. Oh, that&rsquo;s definitely a funkiness in it. I mean, it&rsquo;s all,</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s all, it&rsquo;s all a line. I mean, it&rsquo;s all, there&rsquo;s all a line that carries it all</p>
<p>together. You know, it&rsquo;s, I guess I would answer your question, depending on whether I&rsquo;m thinking</p>
<p>about it in 2020 or I&rsquo;m thinking about it in 1960. Um, I&rsquo;d probably give a different answer.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just thinking in terms of, you know, that was rock, but when you look back on it, it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>it was funky, but we didn&rsquo;t use those words or maybe we did. I wasn&rsquo;t around. Uh, but you know,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think we used the word 1960 funk, certainly not the way we used it in the seventies</p>
<p>and the eighties. Do you reject disco? I do not reject disco. I appreciate all the mistakes that</p>
<p>we have made. Actually, some of the disco is actually really, really good. John Travolta.</p>
<p>Oh boy. He regrets it probably. Maybe not. Well, like it&rsquo;s the mistakes thing.</p>
<p>Yeah. And it got him to where he&rsquo;s going, where he is.</p>
<p>Oh, well, thank you for taking that detour. You&rsquo;ve, you&rsquo;ve talked about computing. We&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>already talked about computing a little bit, but can you try to describe how you think about the</p>
<p>world of computing or it fits into the sets of different disciplines? We mentioned College of</p>
<p>Computing. What, what should people, how should they think about computing, especially from an</p>
<p>educational perspective of like, what is the perfect curriculum that defines for a young mind,</p>
<p>uh, what computing is? So I don&rsquo;t know about a perfect curriculum, although that&rsquo;s an important</p>
<p>question because at the end of the day, without the curriculum, you don&rsquo;t get anywhere. Curriculum</p>
<p>to me is the fundamental data structure. It&rsquo;s not even the classroom. I mean, the world is,</p>
<p>right? I, I, I, so I think the curriculum is where I like to play. Uh, so I spend a lot of time</p>
<p>thinking about this, but I will tell you, I&rsquo;ll answer your question by answering a slightly</p>
<p>different question first and then getting back to this, which is, you know, you talked about</p>
<p>disciplines and what does it mean to be a discipline? The truth is what we really educate</p>
<p>people in from the beginning, but certainly through college, you sort of failed. If you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t think about it this way, I think is the world. People often think about tools and tool</p>
<p>sets, and when you&rsquo;re really trying to be good, you think about skills and skill sets,</p>
<p>but disciplines are about mindsets, right? They&rsquo;re about fundamental ways of thinking, not just the,</p>
<p>the, the hammer that you pick up, whatever that is to hit the nail, um, not just the,</p>
<p>the skill of learning how to hammer well or whatever. It&rsquo;s the mindset of like,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the fundamental way to think about, to think about the world, right? And disciplines,</p>
<p>different disciplines give you different mindsets to give you different ways of sort of thinking</p>
<p>through. So with that in mind, I think that computing, even ask the question, whether</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a discipline that you have to decide, does it have a mindset? Does it have a way of thinking</p>
<p>about the world that is different from, you know, the scientist who is doing a discovery and using</p>
<p>the scientific method as a way of doing it, or the mathematician who builds abstractions and tries</p>
<p>to find sort of steady state truth about the abstractions that may be artificial, but whatever,</p>
<p>or is it the engineer who&rsquo;s all about, you know, building demonstrably superior technology with</p>
<p>respect to some notion of trade offs, whatever that means, right? That&rsquo;s sort of the world that</p>
<p>you, the world that you live in. What is computing? You know, how is computing different? So I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>thought about this for a long time and I&rsquo;ve come to a view about what computing actually is, what</p>
<p>the mindset is. And, and it&rsquo;s, you know, it&rsquo;s a little abstract, but that would be appropriate</p>
<p>for computing. I think that what distinguishes the computationalist from others is that he or</p>
<p>she understands that models, languages and machines are equivalent. They&rsquo;re the same thing. And</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not just a model, but it&rsquo;s a machine that is an executable thing that can be described</p>
<p>as a language. That means that it&rsquo;s dynamic. So it&rsquo;s not the, it is mathematical in some sense,</p>
<p>in the kind of sense of abstraction, but it is fundamentally dynamic and executable. The</p>
<p>mathematician is not necessarily worried about either the dynamic part. In fact, whenever I tried</p>
<p>to write something for mathematicians, they invariably demand that I make it static. And</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not a bad thing. It&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s a way of viewing the world that truth is a thing, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a process that continually runs, right? So that dynamic thing matters. That self reflection</p>
<p>of the system itself matters. And that is what computing, that is what computing brought us.</p>
<p>So it is a science because it, the models fundamentally represent truths in the world.</p>
<p>Information is a scientific thing to discover, right? Not just a mathematical conceit that</p>
<p>that gets created. But of course it&rsquo;s engineering because you&rsquo;re actually dealing with constraints</p>
<p>in the world and trying to execute machines that actually run. But it&rsquo;s also a math because</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re actually worrying about these languages that describe what&rsquo;s happening. But the fact that</p>
<p>regular expressions and finite state automata, one of which feels like a machine or at least</p>
<p>an abstraction machine and the other is a language that they&rsquo;re actually the equivalent thing. I mean,</p>
<p>that is not a small thing and it permeates everything that we do, even when we&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>trying to figure out how to, how to do debugging. So that idea I think is fundamental and we would</p>
<p>do better if we made that more explicit. How my life has changed and my thinking about this</p>
<p>in the 10 or 15 years it&rsquo;s been since I tried to put that to paper with some colleagues is</p>
<p>the realization, which comes to a question you actually asked me earlier, which has to do with</p>
<p>trees falling down and whether it matters, is this sort of triangle of equality.</p>
<p>It only matters because there&rsquo;s a person inside the triangle, right? That what&rsquo;s changed about</p>
<p>computing, computer science or whatever you want to call it, is we now have so much data</p>
<p>and so much computational power. We&rsquo;re able to do really, really interesting, promising things.</p>
<p>But the interesting and the promising kind of only matters with respect to human beings and</p>
<p>their relationship to it. So the triangle exists, that is fundamentally computing.</p>
<p>What makes it worthwhile and interesting and potentially world species changing is that there</p>
<p>are human beings inside of it and intelligence that has to interact with it to change the data,</p>
<p>the information that makes sense and gives meaning to the models, the languages and the machines.</p>
<p>So if the curriculum can convey that while conveying the tools and the skills that you need</p>
<p>in order to succeed, then it is a big win. That&rsquo;s what I think you have to do.</p>
<p>Do you pull psychology, like these human things into that, into the idea,</p>
<p>into this framework of computing? Do you pull in psychology and neuroscience,</p>
<p>like parts of psychology, parts of neuroscience, parts of sociology?</p>
<p>What about philosophy, like studies of human nature from different perspectives?</p>
<p>Absolutely. And by the way, it works both ways. So let&rsquo;s take biology for a moment.</p>
<p>It turns out a cell is basically a bunch of if, then statements, if you look at it the right way,</p>
<p>which is nice because I understand if, then statements. I never really enjoyed biology,</p>
<p>but I do understand if, then statements. And if you tell the biologists that and they begin to</p>
<p>understand that, it actually helps them to think about a bunch of really cool things.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;ll still be biology involved, but whatever. On the other hand, the fact of biology is,</p>
<p>in fact, the cell is a bunch of if, then statements or whatever, allows the computationalist to think</p>
<p>differently about the language and the way that we, well, certainly the way we would do AI machine</p>
<p>learning, but there&rsquo;s just even the way that we think about computation. So the important thing</p>
<p>to me is as my engineering colleagues who are not in computer science worry about computer science</p>
<p>eating up engineering to colleges where computer science is trapped. It&rsquo;s not a worry. You shouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>worry about that at all. Computer science computing, it&rsquo;s central, but it&rsquo;s not the</p>
<p>most important thing in the world. It&rsquo;s not more important. It is just key to helping others do</p>
<p>other cool things they&rsquo;re going to do. You&rsquo;re not going to be a historian in 2030. You&rsquo;re not going</p>
<p>to get your PhD in history without understanding some data science and computing, because the way</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to get history done in part, and I say done, the way you&rsquo;re going to get it done</p>
<p>is you&rsquo;re going to look at data and you&rsquo;re going to let, you&rsquo;re going to have the system that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to help you to analyze things to help you to think about a better way to describe history</p>
<p>and to understand what&rsquo;s going on and what it tells us about where we might be going. The same</p>
<p>is true for psychology. Same is true for all of these things. The reason I brought that up is</p>
<p>because the philosopher has a lot to say about computing. The psychologist has a lot to say</p>
<p>about the way humans interact with computing, right? And certainly a lot about intelligence, which</p>
<p>at least for me, ultimately is kind of the goal of building these computational devices is to build</p>
<p>something intelligent. Did you think computing will eat everything in some certain sense or almost</p>
<p>like disappear because it&rsquo;s part of everything? It&rsquo;s so funny you say this. I want to say it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to metastasize, but there&rsquo;s kind of two ways that fields destroy themselves. One is they become</p>
<p>super narrow. And I think we can think of fields that might be that way. They become pure. And we</p>
<p>have that instinct. We have that impulse. I&rsquo;m sure you can think of several people who want computer</p>
<p>science to be this pure thing. The other way is you become everywhere and you become everything</p>
<p>and nothing. And so everyone says, you know, I&rsquo;m going to teach Fortran for engineers or whatever.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to do this. And then you lose the thing that makes it worth studying in and of itself.</p>
<p>The thing about computing, and this is not unique to computing, though at this point in time,</p>
<p>it is distinctive about computing where we happen to be in 2020 is we are both a thriving major.</p>
<p>In fact, the thriving major, almost every place. And we&rsquo;re a service unit because people need to</p>
<p>know the things we need to know. And our job, much as the mathematician&rsquo;s job is to help,</p>
<p>you know, this person over here to think like a mathematician, much the way the point isn&rsquo;t the</p>
<p>point of view taking chemistry as a freshman is not to learn chemistry. It&rsquo;s to learn to think</p>
<p>like a scientist, right? Our job is to help them to think, think like a computationalist. And we</p>
<p>have to take both of those things very seriously. And I&rsquo;m not sure that as a field, we have</p>
<p>historically certainly taken the second thing that our job is to help them to think a certain way.</p>
<p>People who aren&rsquo;t going to be our major, I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ve taken that that very seriously at all.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you know who Dan Carlin is. He has this podcast called Hardcore History.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve just did an amazing four hour conversation with him, mostly about Hitler. But I bring him</p>
<p>up because he talks about this idea that it&rsquo;s possible that history as a field will become,</p>
<p>like currently, most people study history a little bit, kind of are aware of it. We have a</p>
<p>conversation about it, different parts of it. I mean, there&rsquo;s a lot of criticism to say that some</p>
<p>parts of history are being ignored, blah, blah, blah, so on. But most people are able to have a</p>
<p>curiosity and able to learn it. His thought is it&rsquo;s possible given the way social media works,</p>
<p>the current way we communicate, that history becomes a niche field where literally most people</p>
<p>just ignore because everything is happening so fast that the history starts losing its meaning.</p>
<p>And then it starts being a thing that only, you know, like the theoretical computer science,</p>
<p>part of computer science, it becomes a niche thing that only like the rare holders of the</p>
<p>world wars and the, you know, all the history, the founding of the United States, all those kinds of</p>
<p>things, the Civil Wars. And it&rsquo;s a kind of profound thing to think about how these,</p>
<p>how we can lose track, how we can lose these fields when they&rsquo;re best, like in the case of</p>
<p>history, is best for that to be a pervasive thing that everybody learns and thinks about and so on.</p>
<p>And I would say computing is quite obviously similar to history in the sense that it seems</p>
<p>like it should be a part of everybody&rsquo;s life to some degree, especially like as we move into the</p>
<p>later parts of the 21st century. And it&rsquo;s not obvious that that&rsquo;s the way it&rsquo;ll go. It might</p>
<p>be in the hands of the few still. Like depending if it&rsquo;s machine learning, you know, it&rsquo;s unclear</p>
<p>that computing will win out. It&rsquo;s currently very successful, but it&rsquo;s not, I would say that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>something, I mean, you&rsquo;re at the leadership level of this. You&rsquo;re defining the future. So it&rsquo;s in</p>
<p>your hands. No pressure. But like, it feels like there&rsquo;s multiple ways this can go. And there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>this kind of conversation of everybody should learn to code, right? The changing nature of jobs</p>
<p>and so on. Do you have a sense of what your role in education of computing is here? Like what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the hopeful path forward? There&rsquo;s a lot there. I will say that, well, first off, it would be an</p>
<p>absolute shame if no one studied history. On the other hand, as t approaches infinity, the amount</p>
<p>of history is presumably also growing at least linearly. And so you have to forget more and more</p>
<p>of history, but history needs to always be there. I mean, I can imagine a world where,</p>
<p>you know, if you think of your brains as being outside of your head, that you can kind of learn</p>
<p>the history you need to know when you need to know it. That seems fanciful, but it&rsquo;s a kind of way of,</p>
<p>you know, is there a sufficient statistic of history? No. And there certainly, but there may</p>
<p>be for the particular thing you have to care about, but you know, those who do not remember.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s for our objective camera discussion, right?</p>
<p>Yeah. Right. And, you know, we&rsquo;ve already lost lots of history. And of course you have your</p>
<p>own history that some of which will be, it&rsquo;s even lost to you, right? You don&rsquo;t even remember</p>
<p>whatever it was you were doing 17 years ago.</p>
<p>All the ex girlfriends.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Gone.</p>
<p>Exactly. So, you know, history is being lost anyway, but the big lessons of history shouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>be. And I think, you know, to take it to the question of computing and sort of education,</p>
<p>the point is you have to get across those lessons. You have to get across the way of thinking.</p>
<p>And you have to be able to go back and, you know, you don&rsquo;t want to lose the data,</p>
<p>even if, you know, you don&rsquo;t necessarily have the information at your fingertips.</p>
<p>With computing, I think it&rsquo;s somewhat different. Everyone doesn&rsquo;t have to learn how to code,</p>
<p>but everyone needs to learn how to think in the way that you can be precise. And I mean,</p>
<p>precise in the sense of repeatable, not just, you know, in the sense of not resolution in the sense</p>
<p>of get the right number of bits, um, in saying what it is you want the machine to do and being</p>
<p>able to describe a problem in such a way that it is executable, which we are not human beings are</p>
<p>not very good at that. In fact, I think we spend much of our time talking back and forth just to</p>
<p>kind of vaguely understand what the other person means and hope we get it good enough that we can,</p>
<p>we can act accordingly. Um, you can&rsquo;t do that with machines, at least not yet. And so,</p>
<p>you know, having to think that precisely about things is quite important. And that&rsquo;s somewhat</p>
<p>different from coding. Coding is a crude means to an end. On the other hand, the idea of coding,</p>
<p>what that means that it&rsquo;s a programming language and it has these sort of things that you fiddle</p>
<p>with in these ways that you express. That is an incredibly important point. In fact, I would argue</p>
<p>that one of the big holes in machine learning right now in an AI is that we forget that we are</p>
<p>basically doing software engineering. We forget that we are doing, um, we&rsquo;re using programming,</p>
<p>like we&rsquo;re using languages to express what we&rsquo;re doing. We get just so all caught up in the deep</p>
<p>network or we get all caught up in whatever that we forget that, you know, we&rsquo;re making decisions</p>
<p>based upon a set of parameters that we made up. And if we did slightly different parameters,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;d have completely different, different outcomes. And so the lesson of computing,</p>
<p>computer science education is to be able to think like that and to be aware of it when you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>it. Basically, it&rsquo;s, you know, at the end of the day, it&rsquo;s a way of, um, surfacing your assumptions.</p>
<p>I mean, we call them parameters or, you know, we, we, we call them if then statements or whatever,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re forced to surface those, those assumptions. That&rsquo;s the key, the key thing that</p>
<p>you should get out of a computing education that, and that the models and languages and</p>
<p>machines are equivalent, but it actually follows from that, that you have to be explicit about,</p>
<p>about what it is you&rsquo;re trying to do because the model you&rsquo;re building is something you will one</p>
<p>day run. So you better get it right, or at least understand it and be able to express roughly what,</p>
<p>what you want to express. So I think it is key that we figure out how to educate everyone to</p>
<p>think that way, because at the end, it would not only make them better at whatever it is that they</p>
<p>are doing. And I emphasize doing it&rsquo;ll also make them better citizens. It&rsquo;ll help them to understand</p>
<p>what others are doing to them so that they can react accordingly. Cause you&rsquo;re not going to</p>
<p>solve the problem of social media in so far as you think of social media as a problem</p>
<p>by just making slightly better code, right? It only works if people react to it</p>
<p>appropriately and know what&rsquo;s happening and therefore take control over what they&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s my take on it.</p>
<p>Okay. Let me try to proceed awkwardly into the topic of race.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>One is because it&rsquo;s a fascinating part of your story and you&rsquo;re just eloquent and fun about it.</p>
<p>And then the second is because we&rsquo;re living through a pretty tense time in terms of race,</p>
<p>tensions and discussions and ideas in this time in America. You grew up in Atlanta,</p>
<p>not born in Atlanta. Is some Southern state, somewhere in Tennessee, something like that?</p>
<p>Tennessee.</p>
<p>Nice. Okay. But early on you moved, you&rsquo;re basically, you identify as an Atlanta native.</p>
<p>Mm hmm. Yeah. And you&rsquo;ve mentioned that you grew up in a predominantly black neighborhood,</p>
<p>by the way, black African American person of color.</p>
<p>I prefer black.</p>
<p>Black.</p>
<p>With a capital B.</p>
<p>With a capital B. The other letters are&hellip;</p>
<p>The rest of them, no matter.</p>
<p>Okay. So the predominantly black neighborhood. And so you didn&rsquo;t almost see race. Maybe you</p>
<p>can correct me on that. And then just in the video you talked about when you showed up to</p>
<p>Georgia Tech for your undergrad, you&rsquo;re one of the only black folks there. And that was like,</p>
<p>oh, that was a new experience. So can you take me from just a human perspective,</p>
<p>but also from a race perspective, your journey growing up in Atlanta</p>
<p>and then showing up at Georgia Tech?</p>
<p>Okay. That&rsquo;s easy. And by the way, that story continues through MIT as well.</p>
<p>Yeah. In fact, it was quite a bit more stark at MIT and Boston.</p>
<p>So maybe just a quick pause, Georgia Tech was undergrad, MIT was graduate school.</p>
<p>Mm hmm. And I went directly to grad school from undergrad. So I had no</p>
<p>distractions in between my bachelor&rsquo;s and my master&rsquo;s and PhD.</p>
<p>You didn&rsquo;t go on a backpacking trip in Europe?</p>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t do any of that. In fact, I literally went to IBM for three months, got in a car,</p>
<p>and drove straight to Boston with my mother, or Cambridge.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I moved into an apartment I&rsquo;d never seen over the Royal East. Anyway, that&rsquo;s another story.</p>
<p>So let me tell you a little bit about it.</p>
<p>You miss MIT?</p>
<p>Oh, I loved MIT. I don&rsquo;t miss Boston at all, but I loved MIT.</p>
<p>That was fighting words.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s back up to this. So as you said, I was born in Chattanooga, Tennessee.</p>
<p>My earliest memory is arriving in Atlanta in a moving truck at the age of three and a half.</p>
<p>So I think of myself as being from Atlanta, very distinct memory of that. So I grew up in Atlanta.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the only place I ever knew as a kid. I loved it. Like much of the country, and certainly</p>
<p>much of Atlanta in the 70s and 80s, it was deeply highly segregated, though not in a way that I</p>
<p>think was obvious to you unless you were looking at it or were old enough to have noticed it.</p>
<p>But you could divide up Atlanta, and Atlanta is hardly unique in this way, by highway,</p>
<p>and you could get racing class that way. So I grew up not only in a predominantly</p>
<p>black area, to say the very least, I grew up on the poor side of that. But I was very much aware</p>
<p>of race for a bunch of reasons, one that people made certain that I was, my family did, but also</p>
<p>that it would come up. So in first grade, I had a girlfriend. I say I had a girlfriend. I didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have a girlfriend. I wasn&rsquo;t even entirely sure what girls were in the first grade. But I do remember</p>
<p>she decided I was her girlfriend&rsquo;s little white girl named Heather. And we had a long discussion</p>
<p>about how it was okay for us to be boyfriend and girlfriend, despite the fact that she was white</p>
<p>and I was black. Between the two of you? Did your parents know about this?</p>
<p>Yes. But being a girlfriend and boyfriend in first grade just basically meant that you spent</p>
<p>slightly more time together during recess. I think we Eskimo kissed once. It didn&rsquo;t mean anything.</p>
<p>It was. At the time, it felt very scandalous because everyone was watching. I was like,</p>
<p>ah, my life is now my life has changed in first grade. No one told me elementary school would be</p>
<p>like this. Did you write poetry or not in first grade? That would come later. That would come</p>
<p>during puberty when I wrote lots and lots of poetry. Anyway, so I was aware of it. I didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think too much about it, but I was aware of it. But I was surrounded. It wasn&rsquo;t that I wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>aware of race. It&rsquo;s that I wasn&rsquo;t aware that I was a minority. It&rsquo;s different. And it&rsquo;s because I</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t as far as my world was concerned. I mean, I&rsquo;m six years old, five years old in first grade.</p>
<p>The world is the seven people I see every day. So it didn&rsquo;t feel that way at all.</p>
<p>And by the way, this being Atlanta, home of the civil rights movement and all the rest,</p>
<p>it meant that when I looked at TV, which back then one did because there were only three,</p>
<p>four or five channels. And I saw the news, which my mother might make me watch. Monica Kaufman was</p>
<p>on TV telling me the news and they were all black and the mayor was black and always been</p>
<p>black. And so it just never occurred to me. When I went to Georgia Tech, I remember the first day</p>
<p>walking across campus from West campus to East campus and realizing along the way that of the</p>
<p>hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of students that I was seeing, I was the only black</p>
<p>one. That was enlightening and very off putting because it occurred to me. And then of course,</p>
<p>it continued that way for, well, for the rest of my, for much of the rest of my career at Georgia</p>
<p>Tech. Of course, I found lots of other students and I met people cause in Atlanta, you&rsquo;re either</p>
<p>black or you&rsquo;re white. There was nothing else. So I began to meet students of Asian descent and I</p>
<p>met students who we would call Hispanic and so on and so forth. And you know, so my world,</p>
<p>this is what college is supposed to do, right? It&rsquo;s supposed to open you up to people. And it</p>
<p>did, but it was a very strange thing to be in the minority. When I came to Boston, I will tell you</p>
<p>a story. I applied to one place as an undergrad, Georgia Tech, because I was stupid. I didn&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>any better. I just didn&rsquo;t know any better, right? No one told me. When I went to grad school,</p>
<p>I applied to three places, Georgia Tech, because that&rsquo;s where I was, MIT and CMU.</p>
<p>When I got in to MIT, I got into CMU, but I had a friend who went to CMU. And so I asked him what</p>
<p>he thought about it. He spent his time explaining to me about Pittsburgh, much less about CMU,</p>
<p>but more about Pittsburgh, which I developed a strong opinion based upon his strong opinion,</p>
<p>something about the sun coming out two days out of the year. And I didn&rsquo;t get a chance to go there</p>
<p>because the timing was wrong. I think it was because the timing was wrong. At MIT, I asked</p>
<p>20 people I knew, either when I visited or I had already known for a variety of reasons,</p>
<p>whether they liked Boston. And 10 of them loved it, and 10 of them hated it. The 10 who loved it</p>
<p>were all white. The 10 who hated it were all black. And they explained to me very much why</p>
<p>that was the case. Both stats told me why. And the stories were remarkably the same for the</p>
<p>two clusters. And I came up here, and I could see it immediately, why people would love it</p>
<p>and why people would not. And why people tell you about the nice coffee shops.</p>
<p>Well, it wasn&rsquo;t coffee shops. It was used CD places. But yeah, it was that kind of a thing.</p>
<p>Nice shops. Oh, there&rsquo;s all these students here. Harvard Square is beautiful. You can do all these</p>
<p>things, and you can walk. And something about the outdoors, which I wasn&rsquo;t the slightest bit</p>
<p>interested in. The outdoors is for the bugs. It&rsquo;s not for humans.</p>
<p>That should be a t shirt.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s the way I feel about it. And the black folk told me completely different stories</p>
<p>about which part of town you did not want to be caught in after dark. But that was nothing new.</p>
<p>So I decided that MIT was a great place to be as a university. And I believed it then,</p>
<p>I believe it now. And that whatever it is I wanted to do, I thought I knew what I wanted to do,</p>
<p>but what if I was wrong? Someone there would know how to do it. Of course, then I would pick the</p>
<p>one topic that nobody was working on at the time, but that&rsquo;s okay. It was great. And so I thought</p>
<p>that I would be fine. And I&rsquo;d only be there for like four or five years. I told myself,</p>
<p>which turned out not to be true at all. But I enjoyed my time. I enjoyed my time there.</p>
<p>But I did see a lot of&hellip; I ran across a lot of things that were driven by what I look like</p>
<p>while I was here. I got asked a lot of questions. I ran into a lot of cops. I saw a lot about the</p>
<p>city. But at the time, I mean, I haven&rsquo;t been here a long time. These are the things that I</p>
<p>remember. So this is 1990. There was not a single black radio station. Now this is 1990. I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know if there are any radio stations anymore. I&rsquo;m sure there are, but I don&rsquo;t listen to the radio</p>
<p>anymore and almost no one does, at least if you&rsquo;re under a certain age. But the idea is you could be</p>
<p>in a major metropolitan area and there wasn&rsquo;t a single black radio station, by which I mean,</p>
<p>a radio station to play what we would call black music then, was absurd, but somehow captured kind</p>
<p>of everything about the city. I grew up in Atlanta and you&rsquo;ve heard me tell you about Atlanta.</p>
<p>Boston had no economically viable or socially cohesive black middle class.</p>
<p>Insofar as it existed, it was uniformly distributed throughout large parts, not all parts,</p>
<p>but large parts of the city. And where you had concentrations of black Bostonians,</p>
<p>they tended to be poor. It was very different from where I grew up. I grew up on the poor side of</p>
<p>town, sure. But then in high school, well, in ninth grade, we didn&rsquo;t have middle school. I went</p>
<p>to an eighth grade school where there was a lot of, let&rsquo;s just say, we had a riot the year that</p>
<p>I was there. There was at least one major fight every week. It was an amazing experience. But</p>
<p>when I went to ninth grade, I went to Academy. Math and Science Academy, Mays High. It was a</p>
<p>public school. It was a magnet school. That&rsquo;s why I was able to go there. It was the first high school,</p>
<p>I think, in the state of Georgia to sweep the state math and science fairs. It was great. It had</p>
<p>385 students, all but four of whom were black. I went to school with the daughter of the</p>
<p>former mayor of Atlanta, Michael Jackson&rsquo;s cousin. I mean, it was an upper middle class.</p>
<p>Dr. Justin Marchegiani Dropping names.</p>
<p>Dr. Justin Marchegiani You know, I just drop names occasionally.</p>
<p>You know, drop the mic, drop some names. Just to let you know, I used to hang out with Michael</p>
<p>Jackson&rsquo;s cousin, 12th cousin, nine times removed. I don&rsquo;t know. The point is, they had money. We</p>
<p>had a parking problem because the kids had cars. I did not come from a place where you had cars.</p>
<p>I had my first car when I came to MIT, actually. So, it was just a very different experience for</p>
<p>me. But I&rsquo;d been to places where whether you were rich or whether you were poor, you know,</p>
<p>you could be black and rich or black and poor. And it was there and there were places and they</p>
<p>were segregated by class as well as by race. But that existed. Here, at least when I was here,</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t feel that way at all. And it felt like a bunch of a really interesting contradiction.</p>
<p>It felt like it was the interracial dating capital of the country. It really felt that way.</p>
<p>But it also felt like the most racist place I ever spent any time. You know, you couldn&rsquo;t go</p>
<p>up the Orange Line at that time. I mean, again, that was 30 years ago. I don&rsquo;t know what it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like now. But there were places you couldn&rsquo;t go. And you knew it. Everybody knew it. And there were</p>
<p>places you couldn&rsquo;t live. And everybody knew that. And that was just the greater Boston area in 1992.</p>
<p>Subtle racism or explicit racism?</p>
<p>Both.</p>
<p>In terms of within the institutions, did you feel&hellip;</p>
<p>Was there levels in which you were empowered to be first or one of the first black people in a</p>
<p>particular discipline in some of these great institutions that you were a part of? You know,</p>
<p>Georgia Tech or MIT? And was there a part where it felt limiting?</p>
<p>I always felt empowered. Some of that was my own delusion, I think. But it worked out. So I never</p>
<p>felt&hellip; In fact, quite the opposite. Not only did I not feel as if no one was trying to stop me,</p>
<p>I had the distinct impression that people wanted me to succeed. By people, I meant the people in</p>
<p>power. Not my fellow students. Not that they didn&rsquo;t want me to succeed. But I felt supported,</p>
<p>or at least that people were happy to see me succeed at least as much as anyone else. But,</p>
<p>you know, 1990, you&rsquo;re dealing with a different set of problems. You&rsquo;re very early, at least in</p>
<p>computer science, you&rsquo;re very early in the Jackie Robinson period. There&rsquo;s this thing called the</p>
<p>Jackie Robinson syndrome, which is that the first one has to be perfect or has to be sure to</p>
<p>succeed because if that person fails, no one else comes after for a long time. So it was kind of in</p>
<p>everyone&rsquo;s best interest. But I think it came from a sincere place. I&rsquo;m completely sure that people</p>
<p>went out of their way to try to make certain that the environment would be good. Not just for me,</p>
<p>but for the other people who, of course, were around. And I was the only person in the iLab,</p>
<p>but I wasn&rsquo;t the only person at MIT by a long shot. On the other hand, we&rsquo;re what?</p>
<p>At that point, we would have been, what, less than 20 years away from the first black PhD to</p>
<p>graduate from MIT, right? Shirley Jackson, right? 1971, something like that? Somewhere around then.</p>
<p>So we weren&rsquo;t that far away from the first first, and we were still another eight years away from</p>
<p>the first black PhD in computer science, right? So it was a sort of interesting time. But I did</p>
<p>not feel as if the institutions of the university were against any of that. And furthermore, I felt</p>
<p>as if there was enough of a critical mass across the institute from students and probably faculty</p>
<p>that I didn&rsquo;t know them, who wanted to make certain that the right thing happened. It was very</p>
<p>different from the institutions of the rest of the city, which I think were designed in such a way</p>
<p>that they felt no need to be supportive.</p>
<p>Let me ask a touchy question on that. So you kind of said that you didn&rsquo;t feel,</p>
<p>you felt empowered. Is there some lesson, advice, in the sense that no matter what,</p>
<p>you should feel empowered? You said, you used the word, I think, illusion or delusion.</p>
<p>Is there a sense from the individual perspective where you should always kind of ignore, you know,</p>
<p>the, ignore your own eyes, ignore the little forces that you are able to observe around you,</p>
<p>that are like trying to mess with you of whether it&rsquo;s jealousy, whether it&rsquo;s hatred in its pure</p>
<p>form, whether it&rsquo;s just hatred in its like deluded form, all that kind of stuff?</p>
<p>And just kind of see yourself as empowered and confident and all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>I mean, it certainly helps, but it&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s a trade off, right? You have to be deluded enough</p>
<p>to think that you can succeed. I mean, you can&rsquo;t get a PhD unless you&rsquo;re crazy enough to think you</p>
<p>can invent something that no one else has come up with. I mean, that kind of massive delusion is that</p>
<p>you have to be deluded enough to believe that you can succeed despite whatever odds you see</p>
<p>in front of you, but you can&rsquo;t be so deluded that you don&rsquo;t think that you need to step out of</p>
<p>the way of the oncoming train, right? So it&rsquo;s all a trade off, right? You have to kind of believe in</p>
<p>yourself. It helps to have a support group around you in some way or another. I was able to find</p>
<p>that, I&rsquo;ve been able to find that wherever I&rsquo;ve gone, even if it wasn&rsquo;t necessarily on the floor</p>
<p>that I was in, I had lots of friends when I was here. Many of them still live here. And I&rsquo;ve kept</p>
<p>up with many of them. So I felt supported. And certainly I had my mother and my family and those</p>
<p>people back home that I could always lean back on, even if it were a long distance call that cost</p>
<p>money, which is not something that any of the kids today even know what I&rsquo;m talking about. But</p>
<p>back then it mattered, calling my mom was an expensive proposition. But you have that and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s fine. I think it helps. But you cannot be so deluded that you miss the obvious because it makes</p>
<p>things slower and it makes you think you&rsquo;re doing better than you are and it will hurt you in the</p>
<p>long run. You mentioned cops. You tell a story of being pulled over. Perhaps it happened more than</p>
<p>once. More than once, for sure. One, could you tell that story? And in general, can you give me</p>
<p>a sense of what the world looks like when the law doesn&rsquo;t always look at you with a blank slate?</p>
<p>With a blank slate with objective eyes? I don&rsquo;t know how to say it more poetically.</p>
<p>Well, I guess the, I don&rsquo;t either. I guess the answer is it looks exactly the way it looks now</p>
<p>because this is the world that we happen to live in, right? It&rsquo;s people clustering and doing the</p>
<p>things that they do and making decisions based on one or two bits of information they find</p>
<p>relevant, which, by the way, are all positive feedback loops, which makes it easier for you</p>
<p>to believe what you believed before because you behave in a certain way that makes it true and</p>
<p>it goes on and circles and then cycles and cycles and then cycles. So it&rsquo;s just about being on edge.</p>
<p>I do not, despite having made it over 50 now.</p>
<p>Congratulations, brother.</p>
<p>God, I have a few gray hairs here and there.</p>
<p>You did pretty good.</p>
<p>I think, I don&rsquo;t imagine I will ever see a police officer and not get very, very tense.</p>
<p>Now, everyone gets a little tense because it probably means you&rsquo;re being pulled over for</p>
<p>speeding or something, or you&rsquo;re going to get a ticket or whatever, right? I mean,</p>
<p>the interesting thing about the law in general is that most human beings experience of it is</p>
<p>fundamentally negative, right? You&rsquo;re only dealing with a lawyer if you&rsquo;re in trouble,</p>
<p>except in a few very small circumstances, right? So that&rsquo;s an underlying reality.</p>
<p>Now, imagine that that&rsquo;s also at the hands of the police officer. I remember the time when I got</p>
<p>pulled over that time, halfway between Boston and Wellesley, actually. I remember thinking</p>
<p>when he pulled his gun on me that if he shot me right now, he&rsquo;d get away with it. That was the</p>
<p>that was the worst thing that I felt about that particular moment, is that if he shoots me now,</p>
<p>he will get away with it. It would be years later when I realized actually much worse than that</p>
<p>is that he&rsquo;d get away with it. And if it became a thing that other people knew about,</p>
<p>odds would be, of course, that it wouldn&rsquo;t. But if it became a thing that other people knew about,</p>
<p>if I was living in today&rsquo;s world as opposed to the world 30 years ago, that not only would</p>
<p>get away with it, but that I would be painted a villain. I was probably big and scary, and I</p>
<p>probably moved too fast, and if only I&rsquo;d done what he said, and da, da, da, da, da, da, da,</p>
<p>which is somehow worse, right? You know, that hurts not just you, you&rsquo;re dead, but your family,</p>
<p>and the way people look at you, and look at your legacy or your history, that&rsquo;s terrible.</p>
<p>And it would work. I absolutely believe it would have worked had he done it. Now, he didn&rsquo;t. I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t think he wanted to shoot me. I don&rsquo;t think he felt like killing anybody. He did not go out</p>
<p>that night expecting to do that or planning on doing it, and I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if he never,</p>
<p>ever did that or ever even pulled his gun again. I don&rsquo;t know the man&rsquo;s name. I don&rsquo;t remember</p>
<p>anything about him. I do remember the gun. Guns are very big when they&rsquo;re in your face. I can tell</p>
<p>you this much. They&rsquo;re much larger than they seem. But&hellip; And you&rsquo;re basically like speeding or</p>
<p>something like that? He said I ran a light, I think. You ran a light. I don&rsquo;t think I ran a</p>
<p>light, but you know, in fact, I may not have even gotten a ticket. I may have just gotten a warning.</p>
<p>I think he was a little&hellip; But he pulled a gun. Yeah. Apparently I moved too fast or something.</p>
<p>Rolled my window down before I should have. It&rsquo;s unclear. I think he thought I was going to do</p>
<p>something, or at least that&rsquo;s how he behaved. So how, if we can take a little walk around your</p>
<p>brain, how do you feel about that guy and how do you feel about cops after that experience?</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t remember that guy, but my view on police officers is the same view I have about</p>
<p>lots of things. Fire is an important and necessary thing in the world, but you must respect fire</p>
<p>because it will burn you. Fire is a necessary evil in the sense that it can burn you. Necessary</p>
<p>in the sense that, you know, heat and all the other things that we use fire for. So when I see</p>
<p>a cop, I see a giant ball of flame and I just try to avoid it. And then some people might see</p>
<p>a nice place, a nice thing to roast marshmallows with a family over.</p>
<p>Which is fine, but I don&rsquo;t roast marshmallows.</p>
<p>Okay. So let me go a little dark and I apologize. Just talked to Dan Carlin about</p>
<p>Hitler for four hours. So sorry if I go dark here a little bit, but</p>
<p>is it easy for this experience of just being careful with the fire and avoiding it to turn</p>
<p>to hatred? Yeah, of course. And one might even argue that it is a logical conclusion, right?</p>
<p>On the other hand, you&rsquo;ve got to live in the world and I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s helpful. Hate is something</p>
<p>one should, I mean, hate is something that takes a lot of energy. So one should reserve it for</p>
<p>when it is useful and not carried around with you all the time. Again, there&rsquo;s a big difference</p>
<p>between the happy delusion that convinces you that you can actually get out of bed and</p>
<p>make it to work today without getting hit by a car and the sad delusion that means you can</p>
<p>not worry about this car that is barreling towards you, right? So we all have to be a</p>
<p>little deluded because otherwise we&rsquo;re paralyzed, right? But one should not be ridiculous.</p>
<p>If we go all the way back to something you said earlier about empathy,</p>
<p>I think what I would ask other people to get out of this one of many, many, many stories</p>
<p>is to recognize that it is real. People would ask me to empathize with the police officer.</p>
<p>I would quote back statistics saying that being a police officer isn&rsquo;t even in the top 10 most</p>
<p>dangerous jobs in the United States, you&rsquo;re much more likely to get killed in a taxicab.</p>
<p>Half of police officers are actually killed by suicide, but that means their lives are something,</p>
<p>something&rsquo;s going on there with them and I would more than happy to be empathetic about what it is</p>
<p>they go through and how they see the world. I think though that if we step back from what I feel,</p>
<p>if we step back from what an individual police officer feels, you step up a level and all this,</p>
<p>because all things tie back into interactive AI. The real problem here is that we&rsquo;ve built a</p>
<p>narrative. We built a big structure that has made it easy for people to put themselves into different</p>
<p>pots in the different clusters and to basically forget that the people in the other clusters are</p>
<p>ultimately like them. It is useful exercise to ask yourself sometimes, I think, that if I had grown</p>
<p>up in a completely different house and a completely different household as a completely different</p>
<p>person, if I had been a woman, would I see the world differently? Would I believe what that crazy</p>
<p>person over there believes? And the answer is probably yes, because after all, they believe it.</p>
<p>And fundamentally, they&rsquo;re the same as you. So then what can you possibly do to fix it? How do</p>
<p>you fix Twitter? If you think Twitter needs to be broken or Facebook, if you think Facebook is</p>
<p>broken, how do you fix racism? How do you fix any of these things? That&rsquo;s all structural.</p>
<p>I mean, individual conversations matter a lot, but you have to create structures that allow people</p>
<p>to have those individual conversations all the time in a way that is relatively safe and that</p>
<p>allows them to understand that other people have had different experiences, but that ultimately</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re the same, which sounds very, I don&rsquo;t even know what the right word is. I&rsquo;m trying to avoid</p>
<p>a word like saccharine, but it feels very optimistic.</p>
<p>But I think that&rsquo;s okay. I think that&rsquo;s a part of the delusion, is you want to be a little</p>
<p>optimistic and then recognize that the hard problem is actually setting up the structures</p>
<p>in the first place, because it&rsquo;s in almost no one&rsquo;s interest to change the infrastructure.</p>
<p>Right. I tend to believe that leaders have a big role to that, of selling that optimistic</p>
<p>delusion to everybody, and that eventually leads to the building of the structures. But that</p>
<p>requires a leader that unites, sort of unites everybody on a vision as opposed to divides</p>
<p>on a vision, which is, this particular moment in history feels like there&rsquo;s a nonzero probability,</p>
<p>if we go to the P, of something akin to a violent or a nonviolent civil war. This is one of the</p>
<p>most divisive periods of American history in recent, you can speak to this from a perhaps</p>
<p>a more knowledgeable and deeper perspective than me, but from my naive perspective, this seems like</p>
<p>a very strange time. There&rsquo;s a lot of anger, and it has to do with people, I mean, for many reasons.</p>
<p>One, the thing that&rsquo;s not spoken about, I think, much is the conflict of opinion,</p>
<p>much is the quiet economic pain of millions that&rsquo;s like growing because of COVID, because of closed</p>
<p>businesses, because of like lost dreams. So that&rsquo;s building, whatever that tension is building.</p>
<p>The other is, there seems to be an elevated level of emotion. I&rsquo;m not sure if you can psychoanalyze</p>
<p>where that&rsquo;s coming from, but this sort of, from which the protests and so on percolated. It&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>why now? Why this particular moment in history? Oh, because time, enough time has passed, right?</p>
<p>I mean, you know, the very first race riots were in Boston, not to draw anything from that.</p>
<p>Really? When? Oh, this is before like&hellip; Going way, I mean, like the 1700s or whatever,</p>
<p>right? I mean, there was a massive one in New York. I mean, I&rsquo;m talking way, way, way back when.</p>
<p>So Boston used to be the hotbed of riots. It&rsquo;s just what Boston was all about,</p>
<p>or so I&rsquo;m told from history class. There&rsquo;s an interesting one in New York. I remember when</p>
<p>that was. Anyway, the point is, you know, basically you got to get another generation,</p>
<p>old enough to be angry, but not so old to remember what happened the last time, right?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s sort of what happens. But, you know, you said like two completely, you said two things</p>
<p>there that I think are worth unpacking. One has to do with this sort of moment in time.</p>
<p>And, you know, why? Why is this sort of up built? And the other has to do with a kind of, you know,</p>
<p>sort of the economic reality of COVID. So I&rsquo;m actually, I want to separate those things because,</p>
<p>for example, you know, this happened before COVID happened, right? So let&rsquo;s separate these two</p>
<p>things for a moment. Now, let me preface all this by saying that although I am interested in history,</p>
<p>one of my three minors as an undergrad was history, specifically history, the 1960s. Interesting. The</p>
<p>other was Spanish. And, okay, that&rsquo;s a mistake. Oh, I loved that. And history of Spanish and Spanish</p>
<p>history, actually, but Spanish and the other was what we would now call cognitive science. But at</p>
<p>the time, that&rsquo;s fascinating. Interesting. I minored in Cogsci here for grad school. That was</p>
<p>really, that was really fascinating. It was a very different experience. I mean, it was a very</p>
<p>it was really fascinating. It was a very different experience from all the computer science classes</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been taking, even the Cogsci classes I was taking at an undergrad. Anyway, I&rsquo;m interested</p>
<p>in history, but I&rsquo;m hardly a historian, right? So, you know, forgive my, I will ask the audience to</p>
<p>forgive my simplification. But I think the question that&rsquo;s always worth asking, as opposed, it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>same question, but a little different. Not why now, but why not before? Right? So why the 1950s,</p>
<p>60s civil rights movement as opposed to the 1930s, 1940s? Well, first off, there was a civil</p>
<p>rights movement in the 30s and 40s. It just wasn&rsquo;t of the same character or quite as well known. Post</p>
<p>World War II, lots of interesting things were happening. It&rsquo;s not as if a switch was turned on</p>
<p>and Brown versus the Board of Education or the Montgomery bus boycott. And that&rsquo;s when it</p>
<p>happened. These things been building up forever and go all the way back and all the way back and</p>
<p>all the way back. And, you know, Harriet Tubman was not born in 1950, right? So, you know, we can</p>
<p>take these things. It could have easily happened right after World War II. Yes. I think,</p>
<p>and again, I&rsquo;m not a scholar. I think that the big difference was TV. These things are visible.</p>
<p>People can see them. It&rsquo;s hard to avoid, right? Why not James Farmer? Why Martin Luther King? Because</p>
<p>one was born 20 years after the other, whatever. I think it turns out that, you know what King&rsquo;s</p>
<p>biggest failure was in the early days? It was in Georgia. They were doing the usual thing,</p>
<p>trying to integrate. And I forget the guy&rsquo;s name, but you can look this up. But he, a cop,</p>
<p>he was a sheriff made a deal with the whole state of Georgia. We&rsquo;re going to take people and we are</p>
<p>going to nonviolently put them in trucks. And then we&rsquo;re going to take them and put them in jails</p>
<p>very far away from here. And we&rsquo;re going to do that. And we&rsquo;re not going to, there&rsquo;ll be no</p>
<p>reason for the press to hang around. And they did that and it worked. And the press left and</p>
<p>nothing changed. So next they went to Birmingham, Alabama and Bull O Connor. And you got to see on</p>
<p>TV, little boys and girls being hit with fire hoses and being knocked down. And there was</p>
<p>outrage and things changed, right? Part of the delusion is pretending that nothing bad is</p>
<p>happening that might force you to do something big you don&rsquo;t want to do. But sometimes it gets</p>
<p>put in your face and then you kind of can&rsquo;t ignore it. And a large part in my view of what happened</p>
<p>right was that it was too public to ignore. Now we created other ways of ignoring it.</p>
<p>Lots of change happened in the South, but part of that delusion was that it wasn&rsquo;t going to affect</p>
<p>the West or the Northeast. And of course it did. And that caused its own set of problems, which</p>
<p>went into the late sixties into the seventies. And, you know, in some ways we&rsquo;re living with</p>
<p>that legacy now and so on. So why not what&rsquo;s happening now? Why didn&rsquo;t happen 10 years ago?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s people have more voices. There&rsquo;s not just more TV, there&rsquo;s social media. It&rsquo;s very easy</p>
<p>for these things to kind of build on themselves and things are just quite visible. And there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>demographic change. I mean, the world is changing rapidly, right? And so it&rsquo;s very difficult.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re now seeing people you could have avoided seeing most of your life growing up in a particular</p>
<p>time. And it&rsquo;s happening, it&rsquo;s dispersing at a speed that is fast enough to cause</p>
<p>concern for some people, but not so fast to cause massive negative reaction. So that&rsquo;s that.</p>
<p>On the other hand, and again, that&rsquo;s a massive oversimplification, but I think there&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>there anyway, at least something worth exploring. I&rsquo;m happy to be yelled at by a real historian.</p>
<p>Oh yeah. I mean, there&rsquo;s just the obvious thing. I mean, I guess you&rsquo;re implying, but not</p>
<p>saying this. I mean, it seemed to have percolated the most with just a single video, for example,</p>
<p>the George Floyd video. It&rsquo;s fascinating to think that whatever the mechanisms that put injustice</p>
<p>in front of our face, not like directly in front of our face, those mechanisms are the mechanisms</p>
<p>of change. Yeah. On the other hand, Rodney King. So no one remembers this. I seem to be the only</p>
<p>person who remembers this, but sometime before the Rodney King incident, there was a guy who</p>
<p>was a police officer who was saying that things were really bad in Southern California. And he</p>
<p>was going to prove it by having some news, some camera people follow him around. And he says,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to go into these towns and just follow me for a week. And you will see that I&rsquo;ll get</p>
<p>harassed. And like the first night he goes out there and he crosses into the city, some cops</p>
<p>pull him over and he&rsquo;s a police officer. Remember, they don&rsquo;t know that. Of course they like shove</p>
<p>his face through a glass window. This was on the new, like I distinctly remember watching this as</p>
<p>a kid. Actually, I guess I wasn&rsquo;t a kid. I was in college, I was in grad school at the time.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s not enough. Well, it disappeared like a day late. It didn&rsquo;t go viral.</p>
<p>Yeah. Whatever that is, whatever that magic thing is.</p>
<p>And whatever it was in 92, it was harder to go viral in 92, right? Or 91,</p>
<p>actually it must&rsquo;ve been 90 or 91, but that happened. And like two days later,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like it never happened. Again, nobody remembers this, but I&rsquo;m like the only person.</p>
<p>Sometimes I think I must&rsquo;ve dreamed it. Anyway, Rodney King happens. It goes viral</p>
<p>or the moral equivalent thereof at the time. And eventually we get April 29th. And I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>what the difference was between the two things, other than one thing caught on and one thing</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t. Maybe what&rsquo;s happening now is two things are feeding onto one another. One is more people</p>
<p>are willing to believe. And the other is there&rsquo;s easier and easier ways to give evidence. Cameras,</p>
<p>body cams or whatever, but we&rsquo;re still finding ourselves telling the same story. It&rsquo;s the same</p>
<p>thing over and over again. I would invite you to go back and read the op eds from what people were</p>
<p>saying about the violence is not the right answer after Rodney King. And then go back to 1980 and</p>
<p>the big riots that were happening around then and read the same op ed. It&rsquo;s the same words over and</p>
<p>over and over again. I mean, there&rsquo;s your remembering history right there. I mean,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like literally the same words. Like it could have just caught, but I&rsquo;m surprised no one got</p>
<p>flagged for plagiarism. It&rsquo;s interesting if you have an opinion on the question of violence</p>
<p>and the popular perhaps caricature of Malcolm X versus Martin Luther King.</p>
<p>You know, Malcolm X was older than Martin Luther King. People kind of have it in their head that</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s younger. Well, he died sooner, but only by a few years. People think of MLK as the older</p>
<p>statesman and they think of Malcolm X as the young, angry, whatever, but that&rsquo;s more of a</p>
<p>narrative device. It&rsquo;s not true at all. I don&rsquo;t, I just, I reject the choice as I think it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>false choice. I think they&rsquo;re just things that happen. You just do, as I said, hatred is not,</p>
<p>it takes a lot of energy, but you know, every once in a while you have to fight.</p>
<p>One thing I will say without taking a moral position, which I will not take on this matter,</p>
<p>violence has worked.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s the annoying thing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the annoying thing.</p>
<p>It seems like over the top anger works. Outrage works. So you can say like being calm and rational</p>
<p>and just talking it out is going to lead to progress. But it seems like if you just look</p>
<p>through history being irrationally upset is the way you make progress.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s certainly the way that you get someone to notice you.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And if they don&rsquo;t notice you, I mean, what&rsquo;s the difference between that and what did you,</p>
<p>again, without taking a moral position on this, I&rsquo;m just trying to observe history here.</p>
<p>If you, maybe if television didn&rsquo;t exist, the civil rights movement doesn&rsquo;t happen</p>
<p>or it takes longer or it takes a very different form. Maybe if social media doesn&rsquo;t exist,</p>
<p>a whole host of things, positive and negative don&rsquo;t happen. And what do any of those things</p>
<p>do other than expose things to people? Violence is a way of shouting. I mean,</p>
<p>many people far more talented and thoughtful than I have have said this in one form or another,</p>
<p>right? That violence is the voice of the unheard. It&rsquo;s a thing that people do when they feel as if</p>
<p>they have no other option. And sometimes we agree and sometimes we disagree. Sometimes we think</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re justified. Sometimes we think they are not, but regardless, it is a way of shouting.</p>
<p>And when you shout, people tend to hear you, even if they don&rsquo;t necessarily hear the words</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re saying, they hear that you were shouting. I see no way. So another way of putting</p>
<p>it, which I think is less, let us just say provocative, but I think is true is that all</p>
<p>change, particularly change that impacts power requires struggle. The struggle doesn&rsquo;t have to</p>
<p>be violent, you know, but it&rsquo;s a struggle nonetheless. The powerful don&rsquo;t give up power</p>
<p>easily. I mean, why should they? But even so, it still has to be a struggle. And by the way,</p>
<p>this isn&rsquo;t just about, you know, violent political, whatever, nonviolent political</p>
<p>change, right? This is true for understanding calculus, right? I mean, everything requires</p>
<p>a struggle. We&rsquo;re back to talking about faculty hiring. At the end of the day,</p>
<p>in the end of the day, it all comes down to faculty hiring. All a metaphor. Faculty</p>
<p>hiring is a metaphor for all of life. Let me ask a strange question. Do you think everything is</p>
<p>going to be okay in the next year? Do you have a hope that we&rsquo;re going to be okay?</p>
<p>I tend to think that everything&rsquo;s going to be okay because I just tend to think that everything&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to be okay. My mother says something to me a lot and always has, and I find it quite</p>
<p>comforting, which is this too shall pass and this too shall pass. Now, this too shall pass is not</p>
<p>just this bad thing is going away. Everything passes. I mean, I have a 16 year old daughter</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s going to go to college probably at about 15 minutes, given how fast she seems to be growing</p>
<p>up. And you know, I get to hang out with her now, but one day I won&rsquo;t. She&rsquo;ll ignore me just as much</p>
<p>as I ignored my parents when I was in college and went to grad school. This too shall pass.</p>
<p>But I think that one day, if we&rsquo;re all lucky, you live long enough to look back on something that</p>
<p>happened a while ago, even if it was painful and mostly it&rsquo;s a memory. So yes, I think it&rsquo;ll be okay.</p>
<p>What about humans? Do you think we&rsquo;ll live into the 21st century?</p>
<p>I certainly hope so.</p>
<p>Are you worried that we might destroy ourselves with nuclear weapons, with AGI, with engineering?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not worried about AGI doing it, but I am worried. I mean, at any given moment, right? Also,</p>
<p>but you know, at any given moment, a comet could, I mean, you know, whatever. I tend to think that</p>
<p>outside of things completely beyond our control, we have a better chance than not of making it.</p>
<p>You know, I talked to Alex Filipenko from Berkeley. He was talking about comets and</p>
<p>that they can come out of nowhere. And that was a realization to me. Wow. We&rsquo;re just watching</p>
<p>this darkness and they can just enter. And then we have less than a month.</p>
<p>And yet you make it from day to day.</p>
<p>That one shall not pass. Well, maybe for Earth they&rsquo;ll pass, but not for humans.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m just choosing to believe that it&rsquo;s going to be okay. And we&rsquo;re not going to get hit by</p>
<p>an asteroid, at least not while I&rsquo;m around. And if we are, well, there&rsquo;s very little I can do about</p>
<p>it. So I might as well assume it&rsquo;s not going to happen. It makes food taste better.</p>
<p>It makes food taste better.</p>
<p>So you, out of the millions of things you&rsquo;ve done in your life,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve also began the This Week in Black History calendar of facts.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s like a million questions that can ask here. You said you&rsquo;re not a historian,</p>
<p>but is there, let&rsquo;s start at the big history question of, is there somebody in history,</p>
<p>in black history that you draw a lot of philosophical or personal inspiration from,</p>
<p>or you just find interesting or a moment in history you find interesting?</p>
<p>Well, I find the entirety of the 40s to the 60s and the civil rights movement that didn&rsquo;t happen</p>
<p>and did happen at the same time during then quite inspirational. I mean, I&rsquo;ve read quite a bit of the</p>
<p>time period, at least I did in my younger days when I had more time to read as many things as I</p>
<p>wanted to. What was quirky about This Week in Black History when I started in the 80s was how</p>
<p>focused it was. It was because of the sources I was stealing from. And I was very much stealing</p>
<p>from sort of like, I&rsquo;d take calendars, anything I could find, Google didn&rsquo;t exist, right? And I</p>
<p>just pulled as much as I could and just put it together in one place for other people.</p>
<p>What ended up being quirky about it, and I started getting people sending me information on it,</p>
<p>was the inventors. People who, you know, Gerard Morgan to Benjamin Banneker, right? People who</p>
<p>were inventing things. At a time when, how in the world did they manage to invent anything?</p>
<p>Like, all these other things were happening, mother necessity, right? All these other things</p>
<p>were happening. And, you know, there were so many terrible things happening around them. And, you</p>
<p>know, they went to the wrong state at the wrong time. They may never, never come back, but they</p>
<p>were inventing things we use, right? And it was always inspiring to me that people would still</p>
<p>create even under those circumstances. I got a lot out of that. I also learned a few lessons. I</p>
<p>think, you know, the Charles Richard Drews of the world, you know, you create things that impact</p>
<p>people. You don&rsquo;t necessarily get credit for them. And that&rsquo;s not right, but it&rsquo;s also okay.</p>
<p>TK You okay with that?</p>
<p>CK Up to a point, yeah. I mean, look, in our world,</p>
<p>all we really have is credit.</p>
<p>TK I was always bothered by how much value credit is given.</p>
<p>CK That&rsquo;s the only thing you got. I mean, if you&rsquo;re an academic in some sense,</p>
<p>well, it isn&rsquo;t the only thing you&rsquo;ve got, but it feels that way sometimes.</p>
<p>TK But you got the actual, we&rsquo;re all going to be dead soon. You got the joy of having created</p>
<p>the, you know, the credit with Jan. I&rsquo;ve talked to Jorgen Schmidhuber, right? The Turing Award</p>
<p>given to three people for deep learning. And you could say that a lot of other people should be on</p>
<p>that list. It&rsquo;s the Nobel Prize question. Yeah, it&rsquo;s sad. It&rsquo;s sad. And people like talking about</p>
<p>it. But I feel like in the long arc of history, the only person who will be remembered is Einstein,</p>
<p>Hitler, maybe Elon Musk. And the rest of us are just like&hellip;</p>
<p>CK Well, you know, someone asked me about immortality once and I said,</p>
<p>and I stole this from somebody else. I don&rsquo;t remember who, but it was,</p>
<p>you know, I asked them, what&rsquo;s your great grandfather&rsquo;s name? Any of them? Of course,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t know. Most of us do not know. I mean, I&rsquo;m not entirely sure. I know my grandparents,</p>
<p>all my grandparents names. I know what I called them, right? I don&rsquo;t know their middle names,</p>
<p>for example. It&rsquo;s within living memory, so I could find out. Actually, my grandfather</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t know when he was born. I had no idea how old he was, right? But I definitely don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>any of my great grandparents are. So in some sense, immortality is doing something preferably</p>
<p>positive so that your great grandchildren know who you are, right? And that&rsquo;s kind of what you</p>
<p>can hope for, which is very depressing in some ways. I could turn it into something uplifting</p>
<p>if you need me to, but it&rsquo;s simple, right? It doesn&rsquo;t matter. I don&rsquo;t have to know my great</p>
<p>grandfather was to know that I wouldn&rsquo;t be here without him. And I don&rsquo;t know who my great</p>
<p>grandchildren are. Certainly my great, great grandchildren are, and I&rsquo;ll probably never meet</p>
<p>them. Although I would very much like to, but hopefully I&rsquo;ll set the world in motion in such</p>
<p>a way that their lives will be better than they would have been if I hadn&rsquo;t done that. Well,</p>
<p>certainly they wouldn&rsquo;t have existed if I hadn&rsquo;t done the things that I did.</p>
<p>So I think that&rsquo;s a good positive thing you live on through other people.</p>
<p>Are you afraid of death?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;m afraid of death, but I don&rsquo;t like it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s another t shirt. I mean, do you ponder it? Do you think about the</p>
<p>inevitability of oblivion? I do occasionally. This feels like a very rushing conversation.</p>
<p>I will tell you a story, something that happened to me recently. If you look very carefully,</p>
<p>you will see I have a scar, which by the way, is an interesting story of its own about why people</p>
<p>have half of their thyroid taken out. Some people get scars and some don&rsquo;t. But anyway, I had half</p>
<p>my thyroid taken out. The way I got there, by the way, is its own interesting story, but I won&rsquo;t go</p>
<p>into it. Just suffice it to say, I did what I keep telling people you should never do, which is never</p>
<p>go to the doctor unless you have to, because there&rsquo;s nothing good that&rsquo;s ever going to come</p>
<p>out of a doctor&rsquo;s visit. So I went to the doctor to look at one thing. It&rsquo;s a little bump I had on</p>
<p>the side that I thought might be something bad because my mother made me. And I went there and</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like, oh, it&rsquo;s nothing. But by the way, your thyroid is huge. Can you breathe? Yes,</p>
<p>I can breathe. Are you sure? Because it&rsquo;s pushing on your windpipe. You should be dead.</p>
<p>So I ended up going there. And to look at my thyroid, it was growing. I had what&rsquo;s called a</p>
<p>goiter. And he said, we&rsquo;re going to have to take it out at some point. When? Sometime before you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>85, probably. But if you wait till you&rsquo;re 85, that&rsquo;ll be really bad because you don&rsquo;t want to</p>
<p>have surgery when you&rsquo;re 85 years old, if you can help it. Certainly not the kind of surgery it</p>
<p>takes to take out your thyroid. So I went there and I would decide I would put it off until</p>
<p>December 19th because my birthday is December 18th. And I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to say I made it to</p>
<p>49 or whatever. So I said, I&rsquo;ll wait till after my birthday. In the first six months of that,</p>
<p>nothing changed. Apparently in the next three months, it had grown. I hadn&rsquo;t noticed this at</p>
<p>all. I went and had surgery. They took out half of it. The other half is still there and working</p>
<p>fine, by the way. I don&rsquo;t have to take a pill or anything like that. It&rsquo;s great. I&rsquo;m in the</p>
<p>hospital room and the doctor comes in. I&rsquo;ve got these things in my arm. They&rsquo;re going to do</p>
<p>whatever. They&rsquo;re talking to me. And the anesthesiologist says, huh, your blood</p>
<p>pressure is through the roof. Do you have high blood pressure? I said, no, but I&rsquo;m terrified if</p>
<p>that helps you at all. And the anesthesist, who&rsquo;s the nurse who supports the anesthesiologist,</p>
<p>if I got that right, said, oh, don&rsquo;t worry about it. I&rsquo;ve just put some stuff in your IV. You&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to be feeling pretty good in a couple of minutes. And I remember turning and saying,</p>
<p>well, I&rsquo;m going to feel pretty good in a couple of minutes. Next thing I know, there&rsquo;s this guy</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s moving my bed. And he&rsquo;s talking to me and I have this distinct impression that I&rsquo;ve met</p>
<p>this guy and I should know what he&rsquo;s talking about, but I kind of just don&rsquo;t remember what</p>
<p>just happened. And I look up and I see the tiles going by and I&rsquo;m like, oh, it&rsquo;s just like in the</p>
<p>movies where you see the tiles go by. And then I have this brief thought that I&rsquo;m in an infinitely</p>
<p>long warehouse and there&rsquo;s someone sitting next to me. And I remember thinking, oh, she&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>talking to me. And then I&rsquo;m back in the hospital bed. And in between the time where the tiles were</p>
<p>going by and I got in the hospital bed, something like five hours had passed. Apparently it had</p>
<p>grown so much that it was a four and a half hour procedure instead of an hour long procedure. I</p>
<p>lost a neck size and a half. It was pretty big. Apparently it was as big as my heart.</p>
<p>Why am I telling you this? I&rsquo;m telling you this because&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a hell of a story already. Between tiles going by and me waking up in</p>
<p>my hospital bed, no time passed. There was no sensation of time passing.</p>
<p>When I go to sleep and I wake up in the morning, I have this feeling that time has passed. This</p>
<p>feeling that something has physically changed about me. Nothing happened between the time they</p>
<p>put the magic juice in me and the time that I woke up. Nothing. By the way, my wife was there</p>
<p>with me talking. Apparently I was also talking. I don&rsquo;t remember any of this, but luckily I didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>say anything I wouldn&rsquo;t normally say. My memory of it is I would talk to her and she would teleport</p>
<p>around the room. And then I accused her of witchcraft and that was the end of that.</p>
<p>Her point of view is I would start talking and then I would fall asleep and then I would wake</p>
<p>up and leave off where I was before. I had no notion of any time passing.</p>
<p>I kind of imagine that that&rsquo;s death, is the lack of sensation of time passing. And on the one hand,</p>
<p>I am, I don&rsquo;t know, soothed by the idea that I won&rsquo;t notice. On the other hand, I&rsquo;m very unhappy</p>
<p>at the idea that I won&rsquo;t notice. So I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;m afraid of death, but I&rsquo;m completely sure</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t like it and that I particularly would prefer to discover on my own whether immortality</p>
<p>sucks and be able to make a decision about it. That&rsquo;s what I would prefer. You like to have a</p>
<p>choice in the matter. I would like to have a choice in the matter. Well, again, on the Russian thing,</p>
<p>I think the finiteness of it is the thing that gives it a little flavor, a little spice. Well,</p>
<p>in reinforcement learning, we believe that. That&rsquo;s why we have discount factors. Otherwise,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t matter what you do. Amen. Well, let me, one last question sticking on the Russian theme.</p>
<p>You talked about your great grandparents not remembering their name. What do you think is the,</p>
<p>in this kind of Markov chain that is life, what do you think is the meaning of it all?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the meaning of life? Well, in a world where eventually you won&rsquo;t know who your great</p>
<p>grandchildren are, I&rsquo;m reminded of something I heard once or I read once that I really like,</p>
<p>which is, it is well worth remembering that the entire universe, save for one trifling exception,</p>
<p>is composed entirely of others. And I think that&rsquo;s the meaning of life.</p>
<p>Charles, this is one of the best conversations I&rsquo;ve ever had. And I get to see you tomorrow</p>
<p>again to hang out with who looks to be one of the most, how should I say, interesting personalities</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ll ever get to meet with Michael Lippmann. So I can&rsquo;t wait. I&rsquo;m excited to have had this</p>
<p>opportunity. Thank you for traveling all the way here. It was amazing. I&rsquo;m excited. I always love</p>
