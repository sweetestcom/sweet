<p>[person] For me, WW is the Super Bowl.</p>
<p>[person] You can feel the energy.</p>
<p>[person] It&rsquo;s like really deep insights</p>
<p>of what it feels like being a developer.</p>
<p>[person] Really?</p>
<p>[person] Wow.</p>
<p>[laughs]</p>
<p>[person] Okay, we open on black.</p>
<p>The curtain slowly opens.</p>
<p>Have a DeLorean on the stage.</p>
<p>Tim Cook gets out of that DeLorean,</p>
<p>showing the phone&rsquo;s flux capacitor.</p>
<p>[person] I would probably not start there.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s kind of geeky.</p>
<p>[person] Cut!</p>
<p>[person] Are we going to go again?</p>
<p>[person] So we open on black.</p>
<p>[person] Does it have to be black?</p>
<p>[person] It doesn&rsquo;t have to be black.</p>
<p>[both] It could be yellow.</p>
<p>[person] Now my mind goes into, like, a cartoon.</p>
<p>[person] Imagine someone on their computer,</p>
<p>you know, they have an idea.</p>
<p>And, like, they push, like, enter,</p>
<p>or some red button and it goes out to the world.</p>
<p>And then all of a sudden, there&rsquo;s like millions of people</p>
<p>around the globe that get to experience</p>
<p>the thing that you&rsquo;ve made.</p>
<p>Are you actually able to do all this?</p>
<p>[person] Um&hellip;</p>
<p>[record scratch]</p>
<p>[person] Maybe the title of the film</p>
<p>should be &ldquo;Our Journey Into Tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I see a little girl in an endless white room.</p>
<p>She meets Craig Federighi.</p>
<p>[Craig] Hi.</p>
<p>[person] But we don&rsquo;t see him.</p>
<p>We just hear his voice.</p>
<p>[Craig] Not cool.</p>
<p>[echoing]</p>
<p>[person] Now she&rsquo;s older.</p>
<p>And dressed for work.</p>
<p>[person] There has to be action at this point</p>
<p>or, like, some sort of drama.</p>
<p>She goes to work and discovers something catastrophic.</p>
<p>Someone says&hellip;</p>
<p>[person] We have a bug.</p>
<p>[person] So she comes in</p>
<p>and pounds on the keyboard.</p>
<p>[dramatic music]</p>
<p>And the bug is fixed.</p>
<p>[cheering]</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s like a musical.</p>
<p>[person] Musical?</p>
<p>[person] Yeah, The Bug, But A Musical.</p>
<p>[music]</p>
<p>[music continues]</p>
<p>[music continues]</p>
<p>[person] Wait a minute.</p>
<p>Why not make arena rock of WW?</p>
<p>[music]</p>
<p>There wouldn&rsquo;t be any pyro usually.</p>
<p>But I think, why not?</p>
<p>Pyro is fun.</p>
<p>[person] Do you think it would work?</p>
<p>[person] Uh, you won&rsquo;t know if you don&rsquo;t try.</p>
<p>[music continues]</p>
<p>[chanting]</p>
<p>[cheering]</p>
<p>[Tim] Good morning.</p>
<p>And welcome to WWDC.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so wonderful to see so many familiar faces</p>
<p>with us today.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re excited to share our latest technologies with you</p>
<p>and with the incredible community</p>
<p>of millions of Apple developers around the world.</p>
<p>Your creativity and groundbreaking apps</p>
<p>continue to deliver new and meaningful ways</p>
<p>to enrich people&rsquo;s lives.</p>
<p>We applaud the extraordinary work</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve been able to do</p>
<p>throughout this challenging time.</p>
<p>Last year&rsquo;s WWDC was our most inclusive</p>
<p>and most watched developer conference ever,</p>
<p>with nearly 25 million viewers.</p>
<p>It was exciting to have so many people join us</p>
<p>and to see the impact it had on new Apple developers</p>
<p>as we broadened our audience, welcoming more people</p>
<p>from more places around the world.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve continued to look for ways to help cultivate</p>
<p>the next generation of developers</p>
<p>with an emphasis on those underrepresented in technology.</p>
<p>We host entrepreneur camps for Black and female developers</p>
<p>to foster the talents of future industry leaders.</p>
<p>Our Developer Academies, including the newest in Detroit,</p>
<p>prepare the coders of tomorrow</p>
<p>with valuable tools and training.</p>
<p>And Learn to Code offers an amazing curriculum</p>
<p>for people to develop new skills and learn Swift.</p>
<p>We are committed to being a force for change</p>
<p>as we seek to make the world a better place,</p>
<p>full of opportunity for all of us.</p>
<p>This year, we&rsquo;re bringing you another online experience</p>
<p>featuring over 200 in-depth sessions,</p>
<p>one-to-one labs with Apple engineers,</p>
<p>and so much more.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll provide the tools you need</p>
<p>to continue creating the world&rsquo;s most innovative apps,</p>
<p>apps that inspire us in new ways every day.</p>
<p>And just like last year&rsquo;s WWDC,</p>
<p>this entire conference will be made available for free.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got a lot of exciting news and breakthrough innovations</p>
<p>to share with you today.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s get started by turning it over to Craig</p>
<p>to tell us what&rsquo;s new in iOS.</p>
<p>[Craig] Thanks, Tim.</p>
<p>All right, let&rsquo;s dive right in.</p>
<p>For many of us, our iPhone has become indispensable.</p>
<p>And at the heart of iPhone is iOS.</p>
<p>iOS powers the experiences we&rsquo;ve come to rely on.</p>
<p>This year, we were inspired to create</p>
<p>even more meaningful ways iPhone could help you.</p>
<p>Our new release is iOS 15.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s packed with features that make the iOS experience</p>
<p>adapt to and complement the way you use iPhone,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s staying connected</p>
<p>with those who matter to you most,</p>
<p>finding the space to focus without distraction,</p>
<p>using intelligence to discover the information you need,</p>
<p>or exploring the world around you.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start off with features that will let you</p>
<p>stay connected in brand-new ways.</p>
<p>In a year when figuring out how to get face-to-face</p>
<p>has felt more essential than ever,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve all found ourselves using video calling</p>
<p>for just about everything,</p>
<p>and when it comes to making calls that are easy,</p>
<p>spontaneous, and connect us with the people who matter most,</p>
<p>FaceTime is a standout.</p>
<p>With its incredibly intuitive design</p>
<p>and end-to-end encryption since day one,</p>
<p>FaceTime is how we catch up with friend around the world</p>
<p>and how we stay close to family members when we&rsquo;re apart.</p>
<p>Enjoying these deeply personal moments over video</p>
<p>can bring so much joy,</p>
<p>but it also has its challenges.</p>
<p>When talking in person, our brains process</p>
<p>hundreds of social, auditory and visual cues.</p>
<p>When talking on a video call,</p>
<p>many of those signals can get lost,</p>
<p>leaving us feeling drained.</p>
<p>So this year, we&rsquo;ve set out to make FaceTime calls</p>
<p>feel more natural, comfortable, and lifelike.</p>
<p>First is a feature that makes FaceTime calls</p>
<p>sound like you&rsquo;re sitting in the very same room.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re bringing spatial audio to FaceTime,</p>
<p>creating a sound field that helps conversations flow</p>
<p>as easily as they do face-to-face.</p>
<p>Now your friends&rsquo; voices are spread out</p>
<p>to sound like they&rsquo;re coming from the direction</p>
<p>in which they&rsquo;re positioned on the video call,</p>
<p>making your calls more comfortable and more natural.</p>
<p>Next, let&rsquo;s talk about two powerful new options</p>
<p>for your microphone.</p>
<p>The first is voice isolation.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re on a FaceTime call,</p>
<p>your mic is picking up a cacophony of sound,</p>
<p>so in voice isolation,</p>
<p>machine learning distinguishes those sounds,</p>
<p>blocks out the ambient noise, and prioritizes your voice</p>
<p>so that it comes through crystal clear.</p>
<p>Check it out.</p>
<p>[person] I wish I could be there!</p>
<p>[person] Me too!</p>
<p>Let me fix this.</p>
<p>Better, right?</p>
<p>[person] Yeah.</p>
<p>[person] Got what she wanted for her birthday.</p>
<p>[Craig] Sometimes, though,</p>
<p>we want every bit of sound to come through,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s when you switch to wide spectrum.</p>
<p>In wide spectrum, your mic picks up</p>
<p>an entire symphony&rsquo;s worth of sound:</p>
<p>your voice and everything around you.</p>
<p>Next, let&rsquo;s turn to video.</p>
<p>When you want to see every face in the room,</p>
<p>you can now turn on grid view,</p>
<p>giving you another way to view your group FaceTime calls.</p>
<p>Here, you see people in the same size tiles,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll be able to clearly identify who&rsquo;s speaking</p>
<p>while seeing everyone else&rsquo;s reactions.</p>
<p>And to make your FaceTime video capture</p>
<p>more beautiful than ever, we&rsquo;re introducing portrait mode,</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;ve taken inspiration</p>
<p>from iPhone&rsquo;s stunning portrait photos.</p>
<p>In FaceTime, portrait mode blurs the background</p>
<p>and naturally puts the focus on you.</p>
<p>Next, to help you schedule your FaceTime calls,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve created FaceTime links.</p>
<p>Now you can generate a link for a FaceTime call</p>
<p>and share it anywhere.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a terrific way to plan ahead for a call.</p>
<p>You can send the FaceTime link in places like Messages, email,</p>
<p>WhatsApp, or jump into Calendar</p>
<p>and make an event for your FaceTime call</p>
<p>so everyone will know exactly where to meet and when.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not just Apple devices</p>
<p>that can use a FaceTime link to join your call.</p>
<p>Your friends with Android and Windows devices</p>
<p>can use your FaceTime link to join the call</p>
<p>right from their browser, and even on the web,</p>
<p>FaceTime calls are still end-to-end encrypted,</p>
<p>so your privacy is never compromised.</p>
<p>Some of our favorite ways to connect</p>
<p>involve more than just talking,</p>
<p>like getting together for a weekly movie night</p>
<p>or listening to an album with a friend</p>
<p>that brings back amazing memories.</p>
<p>We love enjoying shared experiences,</p>
<p>and so we built SharePlay.</p>
<p>SharePlay is a powerful new set of features</p>
<p>for shared experiences</p>
<p>that you can enjoy when you&rsquo;re on a FaceTime call.</p>
<p>With SharePlay, you can bring music into your call</p>
<p>for a shared listening experience unlike any other,</p>
<p>watch movies and TV shows</p>
<p>while having rich, real-time connection with your friends.</p>
<p>And share your screen,</p>
<p>giving you limitless possibilities</p>
<p>for bringing apps right into your FaceTime calls.</p>
<p>Let me show you how this works,</p>
<p>starting with listening together.</p>
<p>Say you&rsquo;re hanging out on a FaceTime,</p>
<p>talking about a new album that came out over the weekend.</p>
<p>With SharePlay,</p>
<p>you could bring that album right into the conversation.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re on a call, all you need to do</p>
<p>is press play in Apple Music,</p>
<p>and you can choose to listen together.</p>
<p>And like magic, high quality music playback</p>
<p>will start in sync for everyone on the call,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re still connected with FaceTime while listening.</p>
<p>Everyone on the call can add songs to a shared queue,</p>
<p>and shared playback controls let anyone press play, pause,</p>
<p>or jump to the next track.</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s check out what it&rsquo;s like to watch together.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re on a FaceTime call,</p>
<p>jump to streaming app and press play.</p>
<p>and boom,</p>
<p>you and your friends are watching the same video</p>
<p>totally in sync.</p>
<p>SharePlay is unlike any other</p>
<p>shared content experience out there</p>
<p>because it moves fluidly throughout the whole system.</p>
<p>Maybe you want to order takeout while you watch.</p>
<p>Picture in Picture lets you see your friends</p>
<p>and the video you&rsquo;re enjoying together,</p>
<p>and controls are always accessible</p>
<p>with just a tap.</p>
<p>And if the group wants to stay connected</p>
<p>with no interruptions to the video&rsquo;s sound,</p>
<p>you can jump into Messages</p>
<p>and keep the conversation going there.</p>
<p>And when the moment calls for a bigger screen,</p>
<p>you can extend the video to your Apple TV</p>
<p>and watch it there while sharing the moment</p>
<p>with your friends over FaceTime on your iPhone.</p>
<p>Even when you&rsquo;re using SharePlay across multiple devices,</p>
<p>everyone will remain in sync.</p>
<p>We wanted to make sure you have a ton</p>
<p>of incredible experiences to share in FaceTime,</p>
<p>so in addition to Apple Music and the TV app,</p>
<p>SharePlay is designed to work with</p>
<p>your other favorite apps and streaming services.</p>
<p>With an API built for easy adoption,</p>
<p>developers can bring their own apps right into FaceTime.</p>
<p>And today, we&rsquo;re so pleased to announce</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re already working with some incredible partners.</p>
<p>Watch blockbuster movies with your friends on Disney+,</p>
<p>and hit TV shows on Hulu.</p>
<p>Catch originals from HBO Max.</p>
<p>And see your friends react live to a buzzer-beater</p>
<p>in the NBA app.</p>
<p>Or a speed run on Twitch.</p>
<p>Jump on TikTok to watch the funniest videos of the week,</p>
<p>learn a new skill with a friend on MasterClass,</p>
<p>and so much more.</p>
<p>Finally, check out screen sharing.</p>
<p>You can use it to browse Zillow listings</p>
<p>live with your future roommates</p>
<p>or show off a tricky move in your favorite game.</p>
<p>Screen sharing is also a simple</p>
<p>and super effective way to help someone out</p>
<p>and answer questions right in the moment.</p>
<p>And it works across Apple devices.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s SharePlay, a whole new way in FaceTime</p>
<p>to connect and share experiences with the people you love.</p>
<p>Next, when it comes to staying connected throughout the day,</p>
<p>our go-to is Messages,</p>
<p>and these days, so many of our conversations</p>
<p>are inspired through sharing articles, photos, and more.</p>
<p>So this year, we&rsquo;re introducing great new ways</p>
<p>to enjoy all of this amazing shared content</p>
<p>and the exchanges that follow.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s Mindy to show you how it all works.</p>
<p>[Mindy] Thanks, Craig.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so excited to show you what&rsquo;s new in Messages.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s check out my family&rsquo;s conversation.</p>
<p>Everyone&rsquo;s sending me pictures</p>
<p>from our fun trip down to Joshua Tree.</p>
<p>Look at this brand-new collage design.</p>
<p>And this cool stack with even more photos from Taylor.</p>
<p>I can quickly swipe through them,</p>
<p>tap to view the full bunch,</p>
<p>and add a quick Tapback.</p>
<p>Now, let&rsquo;s see what&rsquo;s going on with my friends.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re always sending me all kinds of things,</p>
<p>like this fun playlist from Leah</p>
<p>and this mission critical article from Casey</p>
<p>about what type of pizza is best.</p>
<p>The thing is, the time when I receive this great content</p>
<p>is often different than when I&rsquo;m ready to enjoy it.</p>
<p>For example, I&rsquo;m not going to read this right now,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;d love to the next time I catch up on the news.</p>
<p>Let me show you something we designed just for that</p>
<p>called Shared with You.</p>
<p>So now, if I head over to the News app,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a new Shared with You section</p>
<p>that conveniently surfaces that pizza article</p>
<p>and a few from my other friends.</p>
<p>Now that I&rsquo;m ready to learn more, I can take a look,</p>
<p>and check this out.</p>
<p>Up top, it shows me who it&rsquo;s from.</p>
<p>And I can tap &ldquo;from Casey&rdquo; to pick up our conversation</p>
<p>and remind her that deep dish</p>
<p>is obviously the best kind of pizza,</p>
<p>and then get right back to browsing.</p>
<p>So now, if I want to check out that playlist Leah sent earlier,</p>
<p>I can head over to Apple Music.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s right here.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a listen.</p>
<p>[percussive music]</p>
<p>Love it.</p>
<p>Definitely adding this one to my library.</p>
<p>Now, one I really love is photos.</p>
<p>Remember those great pictures</p>
<p>from my family&rsquo;s trip to Joshua Tree?</p>
<p>Well, over in the Photos app, the new Shared with You section</p>
<p>makes it super easy to get back to them.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll also appear in my featured photos and memories.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s really cool is,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re automatically brought over to my library too.</p>
<p>So if I scroll back to that Joshua Tree trip,</p>
<p>and drill in,</p>
<p>you can see all the great photos my cousin sent</p>
<p>are right here with the ones I took,</p>
<p>making my collection so much more complete with zero effort.</p>
<p>And Photos is smart enough to only bring over the ones</p>
<p>I actually care about, like the ones I was there for,</p>
<p>so I don&rsquo;t have to worry</p>
<p>about screenshots or memes cluttering up my library.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s sharing in iOS 15.</p>
<p>Back to you, Craig.</p>
<p>[Craig] In addition to Photos, Apple Music, and News,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve built Shared with You</p>
<p>into Safari, Apple Podcasts, and the Apple TV app.</p>
<p>And if something especially important comes through,</p>
<p>you can quickly pin it,</p>
<p>and it will be elevated in Shared with You</p>
<p>and places like search.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s Messages with Shared with You,</p>
<p>bringing connection to the places</p>
<p>you love to enjoy content.</p>
<p>Together with SharePlay</p>
<p>and other powerful updates to FaceTime,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re giving you even more meaningful ways to connect.</p>
<p>Of course, that means making the time for it,</p>
<p>so we have new tools</p>
<p>to help you focus on what matters most.</p>
<p>Today, iPhone plays so many roles in our lives.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s where we get information, how people reach us,</p>
<p>and where we get things done.</p>
<p>This is great, but it means our attention</p>
<p>is being pulled in so many different directions,</p>
<p>and finding that balance between work and life can be tricky.</p>
<p>We want to free up space to focus</p>
<p>and help you be in the moment,</p>
<p>and that starts with notifications.</p>
<p>They have a fresh new look, contact photos for people,</p>
<p>and larger icons for apps,</p>
<p>making them even easier to identify.</p>
<p>Notifications are useful, though they can pile up</p>
<p>throughout the course of a day,</p>
<p>breaking your focus in those moments</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re trying to get in the zone.</p>
<p>And the truth is, while some notifications</p>
<p>require your immediate attention,</p>
<p>others could be dealt with later.</p>
<p>To help you engage on your own time,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re introducing the notification summary,</p>
<p>a helpful collection of your notifications</p>
<p>you can schedule to be delivered at any time you choose,</p>
<p>like in the morning and evening.</p>
<p>We use on-device intelligence</p>
<p>based on how you interact with your apps</p>
<p>to arrange the summary</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s easy to quickly catch up.</p>
<p>Notifications in the summary are ordered by priority,</p>
<p>with the most relevant ones rising to the top.</p>
<p>Notifications from people will not end up in the summary,</p>
<p>so you won&rsquo;t miss important messages as they come in.</p>
<p>If now really isn&rsquo;t a good time,</p>
<p>you can use Do Not Disturb to silence all notifications.</p>
<p>And it turns out, it&rsquo;s even easier to step away and focus</p>
<p>if people know we&rsquo;re busy,</p>
<p>so we created an easy way</p>
<p>to signal to others when you&rsquo;re doing that.</p>
<p>Now when you&rsquo;re using Do Not Disturb,</p>
<p>your status is automatically displayed in Messages.</p>
<p>When you reach out to someone</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s indicated they don&rsquo;t want to be disturbed,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll be reminded in that moment.</p>
<p>And for truly urgent messages, there&rsquo;s a way to get through.</p>
<p>While an important part of finding focus</p>
<p>is about reducing distraction from others,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s also about drawing boundaries for yourself.</p>
<p>There may be periods in your day</p>
<p>when you want to be totally focused on work,</p>
<p>or maybe you just want to be fully present</p>
<p>with your family at dinner.</p>
<p>In these moments, you can use Do Not Disturb</p>
<p>or strike more of a balance with Focus.</p>
<p>Focus is a new way to match your device</p>
<p>to your current mind-set.</p>
<p>With Focus, all you have to do</p>
<p>is choose what you want to focus on.</p>
<p>You can carve out time in your day</p>
<p>for work or your personal life.</p>
<p>When setting up a Focus, we use on-device intelligence</p>
<p>about your past activity to suggest the apps and people</p>
<p>to allow notifications from.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re at work, you could choose</p>
<p>to only be notified by coworkers</p>
<p>or apps like Mail, Calendar, or Slack.</p>
<p>You can even dedicate a page on your home screen</p>
<p>to match your focus</p>
<p>and organize your apps and widgets</p>
<p>in a way that reduces temptations</p>
<p>by making only your work apps visible.</p>
<p>For personal life, we&rsquo;ll suggest being notified</p>
<p>only by friends and family or apps like Calm.</p>
<p>And for a home screen to match,</p>
<p>you can have your favorite entertainment apps like YouTube</p>
<p>or widgets for keeping up with your friends and family.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll even intelligently suggest using a Focus</p>
<p>based on your context,</p>
<p>using different signals like location or time of day.</p>
<p>Of course, you can create a custom Focus too.</p>
<p>And when you use a Focus on one device,</p>
<p>it automatically sets on all your other devices.</p>
<p>We think together, these tools</p>
<p>are a really powerful way to help you find balance.</p>
<p>Not only does iOS give you space to focus,</p>
<p>it also uses intelligence to elevate your experience,</p>
<p>helping you discover more in your photos,</p>
<p>quickly find what you&rsquo;re looking for,</p>
<p>and even relive special moments.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s get started with a feature we call Live Text.</p>
<p>Today our photos are full of rich and useful information,</p>
<p>from photos of places we visit</p>
<p>to handwritten notes of family recipes.</p>
<p>And now Live Text unlocks this information</p>
<p>in a way that&rsquo;s really natural.</p>
<p>It starts with the camera.</p>
<p>Let me show you.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say I just finished a meeting with the team,</p>
<p>and I want to capture my notes from the whiteboard.</p>
<p>I can now just point the camera at the whiteboard</p>
<p>and an indicator appears here in the lower right.</p>
<p>When I tap it, the text just jumps right out.</p>
<p>I can use my normal text selection gestures.</p>
<p>Just drag and copy.</p>
<p>Now I can switch over to Mail and paste those in</p>
<p>and then send this off to Tim.</p>
<p>How cool is that?</p>
<p>And this is great for photos already in your photo library.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a photo of a friend.</p>
<p>You may notice that here at the top there&rsquo;s some text.</p>
<p>Now, I can just select it, like this,</p>
<p>and I have the option to use Look Up</p>
<p>to find out more about this restaurant</p>
<p>and even look up its location.</p>
<p>Oh, and here&rsquo;s a picture from a friend.</p>
<p>Now, you may notice here in the background,</p>
<p>is a phone number.</p>
<p>I can just zoom in, and with Live Text,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s recognized with a link.</p>
<p>I can just tap it and give this place a call,</p>
<p>just like that.</p>
<p>[person] Hi, Wanderlust Creamery.</p>
<p>[Craig] Oh, uh, whoops. Sorry.</p>
<p>Uh, just applying a deep neural network here</p>
<p>to a photo of your shop.</p>
<p>No actual need for ice cream at this time.</p>
<p>Uh, gotta drop. Bye.</p>
<p>Live Text works with photos across the entire system,</p>
<p>including screenshots, Quick Look,</p>
<p>and even photos on the web.</p>
<p>And it understands seven languages,</p>
<p>including simplified and traditional Chinese,</p>
<p>and works across iPhone, iPad, and Mac.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not just text.</p>
<p>You can also look up information</p>
<p>on recognized objects and scenes.</p>
<p>Just tap, and you can look up information,</p>
<p>like the breed of a dog or type of a flower.</p>
<p>And this works for art, books, nature,</p>
<p>pets, and landmarks.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re also making it easier to search for your photos</p>
<p>by adding photos to Spotlight.</p>
<p>Spotlight is the universal place</p>
<p>to start all of your searches.</p>
<p>Now, with photos search in Spotlight,</p>
<p>you can quickly find your photos right from the home screen.</p>
<p>Spotlight leverages intelligence from the Photos app,</p>
<p>so you can search by people, scenes, elements in your photos,</p>
<p>or location, like San Francisco,</p>
<p>And leveraging Live Text,</p>
<p>Spotlight can even find text in your photos,</p>
<p>which is great when you&rsquo;re looking for a photo</p>
<p>of a recipe, a receipt, or even a handwritten note.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve also added all-new rich results for contacts.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll have quick access to call, text,</p>
<p>FaceTime, or email them</p>
<p>and Spotlight intelligently includes</p>
<p>everything related to them:</p>
<p>their location, if shared through Find My,</p>
<p>recent conversations, shared photos,</p>
<p>calendar appointments, notes, and files.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve added all-new rich results</p>
<p>for actors, musicians, TV shows, and movies as well.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s Spotlight.</p>
<p>Next, let&rsquo;s talk about how Photos</p>
<p>uses its deep understanding of what&rsquo;s in your library</p>
<p>to enable powerful, emotional features like Memories.</p>
<p>Memories intelligently curates your favorite moments,</p>
<p>stitching photos and videos together</p>
<p>into heartfelt movies.</p>
<p>To take a closer look at what&rsquo;s new, here&rsquo;s Chelsea.</p>
<p>[Chelsea] Thanks, Craig.</p>
<p>This year we&rsquo;ve got the biggest update ever,</p>
<p>including bringing Apple Music into your Memories</p>
<p>for the first time.</p>
<p>Let me show you.</p>
<p>Here in the Photos app, I can tap on the For You tab,</p>
<p>and my Memories are right at the top.</p>
<p>Check out this beautiful new animated title card.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s watch this one of my climbing adventures.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll hear a relevant, personalized song</p>
<p>from Apple Music that brings the memory to life.</p>
<p>[light acoustic music]</p>
<p>These new memories are built on the fly.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re interactive and alive</p>
<p>and are paced to the beat of the music.</p>
<p>I can tap and hold to pause,</p>
<p>and the music continues to play.</p>
<p>When I let go, the pacing adjusts to get back on beat.</p>
<p>And to see a photo again,</p>
<p>all it takes is a swipe.</p>
<p>To customize my memory, I&rsquo;ll use a new feature</p>
<p>called Memory Mixes.</p>
<p>I can tap to bring up the controls</p>
<p>then tap this button to jump in.</p>
<p>Swiping on this carousel lets me try out different mixes</p>
<p>with intelligently chosen songs, pacing,</p>
<p>and a look to match.</p>
<p>[upbeat music]</p>
<p>[Kacey Musgraves&rsquo; &ldquo;Oh, What a World&rdquo; playing]</p>
<p>Notice how the feel of the memory changed</p>
<p>with a calmer song, slower transitions,</p>
<p>and a black and white look.</p>
<p>[singing] It&rsquo;s hard to believe</p>
<p>[Curtis Harding&rsquo;s &ldquo;On and On&rdquo; playing]</p>
<p>[singing] I gotta get into&hellip;</p>
<p>[Chelsea] This faster song has a more energetic feel.</p>
<p>And these looks aren&rsquo;t just filters.</p>
<p>We analyze each photo</p>
<p>and apply consistent color and contrast,</p>
<p>just like a colorist at a film studio.</p>
<p>To check out more intelligent song suggestions,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tap on the music button.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll notice these top suggestions</p>
<p>are a great fit for my climbing Memory.</p>
<p>With tens of millions of songs in the Apple Music Library,</p>
<p>experts have curated sets of songs</p>
<p>that are combined with my music tastes</p>
<p>and the knowledge of what&rsquo;s in my photos</p>
<p>to create personalized recommendations just for me.</p>
<p>I can search for a specific song</p>
<p>by tapping on the magnifying glass,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m gonna go with something from my listening history.</p>
<p>This song from Imagine Dragons will be perfect.</p>
<p>[singing] &lsquo;Cause I&rsquo;m on top of the world, hey</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m on top of the world, hey</p>
<p>Waiting on this for a while now</p>
<p>Paying my dues to the dirt</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m on top of the world.</p>
<p>And I can keep watching related memories,</p>
<p>personalized with my favorite songs from Apple Music.</p>
<p>And now back to Craig.</p>
<p>[Craig] With Live Text, Look up, Spotlight, and Memories,</p>
<p>iOS 15 elevates the iPhone experience</p>
<p>with on-device intelligence.</p>
<p>Next, let&rsquo;s talk about how iOS helps you better understand</p>
<p>and explore the world around you,</p>
<p>with some great updates to Wallet, Weather, and Maps.</p>
<p>To tell us about what&rsquo;s new in Wallet, here&rsquo;s Jennifer.</p>
<p>[Jennifer] With the Apple Wallet app,</p>
<p>we set out to replace your physical Wallet.</p>
<p>Starting with Apple Pay,</p>
<p>we added payment cards to make payments safer and more secure.</p>
<p>Next, we brought transit cards with Express Mode</p>
<p>to your iPhone.</p>
<p>You just breeze through the turnstiles in San Francisco,</p>
<p>New York, Beijing, Tokyo, and more.</p>
<p>And just recently, Walt Disney World</p>
<p>added their park passes, creating magical moments</p>
<p>as you tap to enter, ride, and explore.</p>
<p>You can never leave home without your keys,</p>
<p>so we&rsquo;re continuing to add keys to Wallet</p>
<p>and making them even better.</p>
<p>We started with car keys,</p>
<p>which we&rsquo;re improving with Ultra-Wideband support</p>
<p>for an unlock and drive experience.</p>
<p>No need to take your iPhone out of your bag or pocket.</p>
<p>BMW and others will ship cars with UWBs</p>
<p>starting later this year.</p>
<p>With iOS 15, we&rsquo;re bringing keys for your everyday places</p>
<p>to Wallet, starting with where you live.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re creating the fastest, most secure way</p>
<p>to unlock your house, apartment, or flat,</p>
<p>and where you work.</p>
<p>Just add your corporate badge</p>
<p>and tap to enter your building or office.</p>
<p>And where you travel, with hotel keys.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll automatically receive your key</p>
<p>when your room is ready,</p>
<p>even before you arrive at the hotel.</p>
<p>Starting this fall, Hyatt hotels will start rolling this out</p>
<p>to over 1,000 properties worldwide,</p>
<p>creating a faster and safer experience for their guests.</p>
<p>Anywhere you go, just tap to unlock.</p>
<p>An incredible range of partners for locks and access systems</p>
<p>have signed on to support keys for all the places you go.</p>
<p>However, to be fully free of your physical wallet,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s one more thing we need to bring to iPhone,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s your ID.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re bringing identity cards to Apple Wallet.</p>
<p>This fall, you&rsquo;ll just scan your driver&rsquo;s license</p>
<p>or state ID in participating US states.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that easy.</p>
<p>Your ID information is now in Wallet,</p>
<p>encrypted and safely stored in the Secure Element,</p>
<p>the same hardware technology</p>
<p>that makes Apple Pay private and secure.</p>
<p>And the TSA is working to enable airport security checkpoints</p>
<p>as the first place you can use your digital ID.</p>
<p>When you present your ID,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll know what specific information is requested</p>
<p>and securely presented.</p>
<p>With just a tap, you&rsquo;re off to your flight.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s Wallet on your iPhone and Apple Watch.</p>
<p>Back to you, Craig.</p>
<p>[Craig] Next up, weather.</p>
<p>The Weather app is incredibly popular,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s getting a huge update.</p>
<p>First, we&rsquo;re introducing a beautiful new design</p>
<p>with data and layouts that change based on conditions</p>
<p>such as wind and rain, unhealthy air quality,</p>
<p>or sunny skies.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve also added new weather graphics</p>
<p>to help users better understand conditions</p>
<p>like wind, UV index, and barometric pressure.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve completely redesigned</p>
<p>the gorgeous animated backgrounds.</p>
<p>There are now thousands of variations</p>
<p>that more accurately represent</p>
<p>the sun position, clouds, and precipitation.</p>
<p>And Weather app in iOS 15</p>
<p>includes full-screen, high-resolution weather maps.</p>
<p>These maps show temperature,</p>
<p>animated precipitation, and air quality</p>
<p>that provide a whole new way to see the weather around you.</p>
<p>Next, we have some really big updates</p>
<p>for another app our users depend on every day.</p>
<p>Apple Maps.</p>
<p>Apple Maps is the best way to navigate your world.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy to use and beautifully designed,</p>
<p>while providing the confidence that your privacy is protected.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s Meg to tell you more.</p>
<p>[Meg] Two years ago, we started rolling out our new map,</p>
<p>offering richer details and more accurate navigation</p>
<p>to help you get around.</p>
<p>Built from the ground up, we&rsquo;ve launched our new map</p>
<p>so far in the U.S., UK, Ireland, and Canada,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re excited to announce</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re bringing the new map today to Spain and Portugal,</p>
<p>and later this year,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll add Italy and Australia.</p>
<p>Our goal has always been to build the world&rsquo;s best map.</p>
<p>So we looked at everything we&rsquo;ve done so far,</p>
<p>and we asked ourselves, &ldquo;How can we push things even further?&rdquo;</p>
<p>We started by building a gorgeous, interactive globe</p>
<p>that invites users to tap and explore.</p>
<p>This is a whole new way of looking at the world.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s in cities</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;re taking Apple Maps to an entirely new level.</p>
<p>Our current map is great, and our users have told us</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a lot more useful for navigation and exploration,</p>
<p>but in iOS 15, Maps will offer incredible new details</p>
<p>for commercial districts, marinas, buildings,</p>
<p>and so much more.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve added things like elevation,</p>
<p>new road colors and labels,</p>
<p>as well as hundreds of custom-designed landmarks</p>
<p>for places like Coit Tower and the Golden Gate Bridge.</p>
<p>And we built a beautiful new nighttime mode</p>
<p>with a moonlit glow.</p>
<p>We think all of these improvements</p>
<p>are going to make exploring a city</p>
<p>so much fun for Maps users.</p>
<p>And when a user is ready to go somewhere,</p>
<p>Maps in iOS 15 will make getting there way better.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with driving.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve added a great deal of new road details to the map</p>
<p>so we can help drivers as they move throughout a city,</p>
<p>to better see and understand important things</p>
<p>like turn lanes, medians, bus and taxi lanes, and more.</p>
<p>This outstanding attention to detail,</p>
<p>including the addition of crosswalks and bike lanes,</p>
<p>will help drivers more safely navigate complex intersections.</p>
<p>And when driving on highways, Maps now renders</p>
<p>overlapping, complex interchanges</p>
<p>in three-dimensional space,</p>
<p>making it much easier to see upcoming traffic conditions</p>
<p>or to know which lane you need to be in.</p>
<p>And of course, we&rsquo;ll be bringing this driving experience</p>
<p>to CarPlay later this year.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not just driving.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve also made big improvements for transit riders</p>
<p>by helping them easily find nearby stations.</p>
<p>Users can pin their favorite lines to the top</p>
<p>and even keep track on their Apple Watch</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s no need to take your phone out of your pocket.</p>
<p>Maps also automatically follows your transit route,</p>
<p>notifying you it&rsquo;s time to disembark</p>
<p>as you approach your final destination.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;ve ever exited a station,</p>
<p>unsure of which direction you need to go,</p>
<p>Maps will help get you back on track.</p>
<p>Simply hold up your iPhone, scan the buildings in the area,</p>
<p>and Maps will generate a highly accurate position,</p>
<p>delivering detailed directions in augmented reality</p>
<p>to help you complete your journey.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re launching this beautiful new three-dimensional experience</p>
<p>in these cities by the end of 2021,</p>
<p>with many more to come next year.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the all-new Apple Maps.</p>
<p>Back to you, Craig.</p>
<p>[Craig] So that&rsquo;s just some of what&rsquo;s new in Apple Maps.</p>
<p>An incredible new way to explore the natural beauty of the world,</p>
<p>and an amazing new three-dimensional</p>
<p>city experience with improved navigation.</p>
<p>iOS 15 is a great release that helps you stay connected,</p>
<p>find focus, discover more with on-device-intelligence,</p>
<p>and explore the world.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s more, including Voice Search in Safari,</p>
<p>powerful support for cross-app drag and drop,</p>
<p>and new outfit options for Memoji.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s iOS 15,</p>
<p>with powerful new features that enhance how you use iPhone.</p>
<p>And of course, one of the most popular</p>
<p>accessories for iPhone is AirPods.</p>
<p>To tell you more about what&rsquo;s new, here&rsquo;s Gagan.</p>
<p>[upbeat music]</p>
<p>‚ô™ ‚ô™</p>
<p>[singer] ‚ô™ Party for you ‚ô™</p>
<p>[Gagan] AirPods have helped us enjoy music like never before,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ve helped us stay connected</p>
<p>in so many different ways, whether to friends and family,</p>
<p>to our devices, or to our favorite entertainment.</p>
<p>With iOS 15, we have some great new features coming to AirPods,</p>
<p>starting with Conversation Boost,</p>
<p>which is designed to help people with mild hearing challenges</p>
<p>stay more connected in conversations.</p>
<p>Through computational audio and beamforming microphones,</p>
<p>Conversation Boost focuses your AirPods Pro</p>
<p>on the person talking in front of you,</p>
<p>making it easier to hear and follow along</p>
<p>in a face-to-face conversation.</p>
<p>And to help you hear the conversation even better,</p>
<p>you can also reduce the amount of ambient noise.</p>
<p>Next, when you can&rsquo;t reach for your iPhone,</p>
<p>Announce Messages with Siri helps you stay connected.</p>
<p>iOS 15 takes this further with Announce Notifications.</p>
<p>Now Siri can automatically read</p>
<p>your important, time-sensitive notifications to you,</p>
<p>like when your dinner has been delivered.</p>
<p>And when you set a location for your Reminder,</p>
<p>like the grocery store,</p>
<p>Siri will read your shopping list to you</p>
<p>right when you need it.</p>
<p>You can easily choose which Apps to enable</p>
<p>and select Do Not Disturb</p>
<p>when you don&rsquo;t want to be interrupted.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re using the new Focus feature,</p>
<p>your notification preferences are already taken into account.</p>
<p>Next, we have significantly improved</p>
<p>how AirPods work in Find My.</p>
<p>With iOS 15, you can locate your AirPods Pro and AirPods Max</p>
<p>using the Find My network.</p>
<p>Your AirPods simply send out a secure Bluetooth beacon</p>
<p>that can be detected by other Apple devices.</p>
<p>They can relay your AirPods&rsquo; location to the network</p>
<p>and then back to your Find My app.</p>
<p>And if they&rsquo;re nearby, just choose Play Sound.</p>
<p>Listen for the chirp, whether they&rsquo;re in their case or out.</p>
<p>[chirping]</p>
<p>And the new proximity view in the Find My app</p>
<p>lets you know when you&rsquo;re getting close.</p>
<p>[chime]</p>
<p>To make it even less likely to lose your AirPods,</p>
<p>you can now receive a Separation Alert</p>
<p>to notify you if you leave your AirPods behind.</p>
<p>Finally, last year, we introduced spatial audio</p>
<p>with dynamic head tracking for AirPods Pro</p>
<p>and then elevated the experience even further</p>
<p>with the high fidelity audio of AirPods Max.</p>
<p>Enabled by computational audio,</p>
<p>the three-dimensional theater-like sound</p>
<p>really makes movies come to life.</p>
<p>This fall, we&rsquo;re excited to extend spatial audio to tvOS.</p>
<p>So now you can enjoy the full surround experience,</p>
<p>tuned for the big screen in your living room,</p>
<p>without disturbing the rest of the house.</p>
<p>And with dynamic head tracking,</p>
<p>it properly responds as you move about the room.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re also bringing spatial audio with dynamic head tracking</p>
<p>to macOS on our new M1 powered Macs</p>
<p>so you can enjoy spatial on all of your devices.</p>
<p>In addition, we recently announced spatial audio</p>
<p>for Apple Music with the incredible</p>
<p>multi-dimensional sound experience of Dolby Atmos.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re excited that it&rsquo;s available starting today</p>
<p>with albums from some of your favorite artists,</p>
<p>like Ariana Grande, The Weeknd, J Balvin, and Kacey Musgraves.</p>
<p>With the benefits of Conversation Boost,</p>
<p>the convenience of Find My,</p>
<p>and the enhanced experience with spatial audio,</p>
<p>there are some great new features</p>
<p>coming to the AirPods family.</p>
<p>Now back to you, Craig.</p>
<p>[singer] ‚ô™ Just like magic, oh, yeah ‚ô™</p>
<p>[Craig] It&rsquo;s time to talk about iPadOS.</p>
<p>iPad is an incredibly versatile device,</p>
<p>with its unique blend of mobility,</p>
<p>innovative technologies, and touch-first user experience,</p>
<p>and this experience is powered by iPadOS.</p>
<p>With iPadOS, we build distinct capabilities</p>
<p>that make it possible for iPad</p>
<p>to become whatever you need it to be,</p>
<p>like when you&rsquo;re browsing your photos</p>
<p>and iPad becomes an album of your most precious memories,</p>
<p>held right in your hands;</p>
<p>or when you pick up Apple Pencil</p>
<p>and it becomes your notepad, a markup tool,</p>
<p>or a canvas for new artwork;</p>
<p>or when you attach a keyboard and trackpad,</p>
<p>and it becomes a powerful new way</p>
<p>to work on your most important documents.</p>
<p>This unique set of capabilities</p>
<p>mean you get things done right in the moment</p>
<p>and can seamlessly move</p>
<p>from capturing and working on your ideas</p>
<p>to sharing them.</p>
<p>With iPadOS 15,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re taking this versatility further,</p>
<p>making iPad even more capable and more intuitive,</p>
<p>and we started right on the home screen with widgets.</p>
<p>They offer beautiful, glance-able information</p>
<p>at just the right moments,</p>
<p>and this year, we have a big update.</p>
<p>Now you can freely place widgets</p>
<p>among the apps on your home screen.</p>
<p>This is a huge deal!</p>
<p>Let me show you how it works.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Here I am on the home screen.</p>
<p>You can see that I already have a few widgets</p>
<p>placed along the top.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start by adding a widget.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll bring up the widget gallery.</p>
<p>Here you&rsquo;ll notice some new widgets</p>
<p>like the beautiful new Find My widget</p>
<p>and the Contacts widget</p>
<p>which helps you reach family and friends</p>
<p>with just a tap.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s find a good spot for this, towards the top here.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;ll go back to the gallery and grab the Parcel widget</p>
<p>for tracking my incoming packages</p>
<p>right on the home screen.</p>
<p>Perfect.</p>
<p>Now, of course a bigger canvas means more room for widgets,</p>
<p>so we&rsquo;re adding a new, larger format for widgets</p>
<p>designed just for iPad&rsquo;s larger display.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the new Apple TV widget.</p>
<p>I can easily dive into my favorite shows with a tap,</p>
<p>and here&rsquo;s my gaming page.</p>
<p>The new Game Center widget</p>
<p>lets me jump into my games faster</p>
<p>and discover what to play with friends.</p>
<p>And check out the new large-size Photos widget.</p>
<p>It really puts my favorite photos front and center,</p>
<p>and with this larger Files widget,</p>
<p>I can keep tabs on all of my work projects.</p>
<p>Now, with pages full of these great widgets,</p>
<p>some of my less frequently used apps</p>
<p>have gotten pushed to later pages.</p>
<p>We wanted to make it easier to get to all of your apps,</p>
<p>so we brought App Library to iPad.</p>
<p>You can see all my apps are here,</p>
<p>automatically categorized for me.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s really cool is we built access to App Library</p>
<p>right into the Dock,</p>
<p>no matter where you are,</p>
<p>you can always get to your apps.</p>
<p>And now that you have App Library,</p>
<p>you can hide pages that you no longer need&hellip;</p>
<p>just like this.</p>
<p>And even reorder them right from here.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s widgets and App Library.</p>
<p>We think this is going to change how you get information</p>
<p>and access all your apps on iPad.</p>
<p>We also have a major update</p>
<p>for another key part of the iPadOS experience:</p>
<p>multitasking.</p>
<p>This year, we&rsquo;ve made it easier to discover,</p>
<p>easier to use, and even more powerful.</p>
<p>To give you a closer look, here&rsquo;s Shubham.</p>
<p>[Shubham] Thanks, Craig.</p>
<p>In iPadOS 15, there&rsquo;s a new control</p>
<p>that appears at the top of your apps.</p>
<p>Tapping on it reveals the multitasking menu.</p>
<p>From here, I can take an app, full-screen,</p>
<p>or work with two apps at the same time</p>
<p>by creating a Split View or Slide Over.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tap on the Split View icon,</p>
<p>and the app slides to the edge of the screen,</p>
<p>giving me quick access to my home screen,</p>
<p>where I can easily select from any of my apps.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been working on a podcast, so I&rsquo;ll choose Ferrite.</p>
<p>And now I can work with Ferrite and Notes</p>
<p>at the same time in Split View.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also really easy to switch apps in Split View.</p>
<p>If I want to replace Ferrite, I just swipe down,</p>
<p>and Notes moves aside,</p>
<p>letting me pick another app from the home screen.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s select Mail.</p>
<p>This works exactly the same way</p>
<p>to choose a new app from either side of the screen.</p>
<p>And we brought the same ease of multitasking</p>
<p>to apps with multiple windows.</p>
<p>In Mail, I can touch and hold on this message</p>
<p>to open it centered on my screen.</p>
<p>This allows me to read the entire email</p>
<p>without leaving my current view.</p>
<p>And I have the same multitasking controls here, too,</p>
<p>so I can easily move this into Split View or Slide Over.</p>
<p>But I want to save this email and come back to it later.</p>
<p>So I can just swipe down to minimize it</p>
<p>into a new area we&rsquo;re calling the Shelf.</p>
<p>The Shelf gives me easy access to all open windows of an app.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go to Safari, and you&rsquo;ll see that</p>
<p>the Shelf appears automatically when I switch apps.</p>
<p>I often have a lot of Safari windows open,</p>
<p>many in Split View paired with other apps,</p>
<p>and now I can just tap to quickly switch between them.</p>
<p>I can also add or remove windows right here from the Shelf.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve also made the App Switcher even more powerful.</p>
<p>I can now create a Split view</p>
<p>just by dragging one app over another.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s multitasking in iPadOS 15.</p>
<p>Now back to you, Craig.</p>
<p>[Craig] Thanks, Shubham.</p>
<p>These new multitasking features</p>
<p>will help our users be more productive</p>
<p>and do even more on their iPad,</p>
<p>and what&rsquo;s really cool</p>
<p>is we now have a new set of keyboard shortcuts</p>
<p>that let you do all of this without lifting a finger.</p>
<p>iPadOS 15 also gives you more powerful ways</p>
<p>to capture and organize your information with Notes.</p>
<p>This year we&rsquo;re adding powerful new features</p>
<p>for collaboration and organization.</p>
<p>First, we&rsquo;re adding mentions.</p>
<p>Just mention someone in a shared note</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll get a notification linking them back.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also an all-new Activity View</p>
<p>that quickly shows you what&rsquo;s changed</p>
<p>in a shared note while you were away.</p>
<p>And to give users new ways to organize their notes,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re adding tags.</p>
<p>You can add a tag anywhere in your note</p>
<p>then use the new Tag Browser to quickly find your notes.</p>
<p>But sometimes you just want to quickly jot down a note</p>
<p>to remember something important for later,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re taking Notes system-wide</p>
<p>with a feature we call Quick Note.</p>
<p>Quick Note is a fast and easy way to get to a note,</p>
<p>no matter what you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s Will to show you how it works.</p>
<p>[Will] Thanks, Craig.</p>
<p>Starting a Quick Note is easy.</p>
<p>When I swipe, the note appears</p>
<p>out of the corner of the screen.</p>
<p>Now that I&rsquo;ve started a note,</p>
<p>I can type or write with Apple Pencil.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s perfect for jotting down something like a phone number.</p>
<p>And when I&rsquo;m done, I just swipe it away.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s open Safari.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s super cool about Quick Note</p>
<p>is that it&rsquo;s aware of the app I&rsquo;m using.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll start a new Quick Note on top of Safari&hellip;</p>
<p>&hellip;and now I can easily add a link from the website</p>
<p>into my Quick Note.</p>
<p>I can tap this link anytime to return to this exact site.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go to a website I added a link to earlier.</p>
<p>A small thumbnail pops up in the corner</p>
<p>that allows me to quickly get back to my Quick Note</p>
<p>containing any useful information I found.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll notice there&rsquo;s text highlighted on the page.</p>
<p>And I added this text to my Quick Note.</p>
<p>And tapping on a link from a highlight</p>
<p>takes me right to the content on the page.</p>
<p>I can add a link from almost any app I&rsquo;m using,</p>
<p>including third-party apps.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a link from Yelp, and if I tap,</p>
<p>it takes me right to the restaurant listing.</p>
<p>I can swipe across my Quick Note</p>
<p>to see my most recent ones.</p>
<p>And anytime I want to see all my Quick Notes,</p>
<p>I can find them right where you&rsquo;d expect, in Notes.</p>
<p>Now back to Craig.</p>
<p>[Craig] Thanks, Will.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s Quick Note,</p>
<p>a new way to capture information anywhere.</p>
<p>Quick Notes can be created on iPadOS and macOS,</p>
<p>and you can access and edit them later on iOS.</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s talk about Translate.</p>
<p>In just one year, Translate has already helped users</p>
<p>make billions of translations on iOS.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re excited to bring Translate to iPad,</p>
<p>with experiences that leverage iPad&rsquo;s unique capabilities,</p>
<p>like practicing handwriting in another language</p>
<p>with Apple Pencil</p>
<p>or translating right next to your document</p>
<p>with Split View.</p>
<p>And Translate was designed for conversations.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re making conversations feel easier</p>
<p>and even more natural with Auto Translate.</p>
<p>Auto Translate detects when you&rsquo;re speaking,</p>
<p>and in which language,</p>
<p>so no one needs to tap a button to respond.</p>
<p>Just speak and let Translate do the rest.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re also excited to announce system-wide translation.</p>
<p>So you can translate text anywhere.</p>
<p>Just select the text and tap Translate.</p>
<p>With Live Text, you can even translate text in a photo.</p>
<p>System-wide translation is available</p>
<p>on iPadOS, iOS, and macOS,</p>
<p>and of course, you can download languages</p>
<p>to use all of these features on-device.</p>
<p>Whether you&rsquo;re working on a document</p>
<p>or meeting with someone,</p>
<p>Translate makes iPad even more powerful.</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s talk about Swift Playgrounds</p>
<p>and how it&rsquo;s bringing a whole new dimension of productivity</p>
<p>to iPad.</p>
<p>Swift Playgrounds is a great way to learn to code</p>
<p>through a series of Apple-designed lesson plans</p>
<p>that are interactive and fun.</p>
<p>This year we&rsquo;re taking it even further</p>
<p>by adding the ability to build apps on iPad.</p>
<p>You build these apps with Swift UI,</p>
<p>which makes development easy.</p>
<p>The code you write is immediately reflected</p>
<p>in a live preview of your app.</p>
<p>This new project type even works with Xcode on Mac.</p>
<p>Swift Playgrounds now supports improved code completion,</p>
<p>so you can just start typing</p>
<p>and quickly add the suggestion to your code.</p>
<p>You also have access to the whole library</p>
<p>of UI components</p>
<p>and the documentation to go with it.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re new to app development,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a guide to creating your first app.</p>
<p>While you&rsquo;re developing your app,</p>
<p>you can run it full-screen to try it out,</p>
<p>and when you&rsquo;re ready,</p>
<p>you can even submit it to the App Store.</p>
<p>This is amazing!</p>
<p>You can now build apps for iPhone and iPad on iPad.</p>
<p>We think this will take iPad to new places.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s iPadOS 15,</p>
<p>taking the versatility of iPad even further</p>
<p>with new widget layouts for your home screen,</p>
<p>App library, and a redesigned multitasking experience,</p>
<p>new note-taking and translation features,</p>
<p>and the ability to build apps with Swift Playgrounds.</p>
<p>Combined with the great new features we talked about in iOS,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s time to completely rethink what you can do with your iPad.</p>
<p>Next, let&rsquo;s get into Privacy.</p>
<p>[energetic music]</p>
<p>‚ô™ ‚ô™</p>
<p>At Apple, we believe privacy is a fundamental human right.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t think you should have to make a trade-off</p>
<p>between great features and privacy.</p>
<p>We believe you deserve both.</p>
<p>Since the beginning,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve worked to help you keep your personal data</p>
<p>under your control.</p>
<p>And over the years, we&rsquo;ve integrated</p>
<p>powerful privacy controls</p>
<p>into our operating systems, most recently adding</p>
<p>Privacy Nutrition Labels and App Tracking Transparency.</p>
<p>Today, privacy is more important than ever,</p>
<p>because when you use the internet</p>
<p>and third-party apps, you can be tracked</p>
<p>by a complex ecosystem of data brokers</p>
<p>and ad tech firms, often without your permission.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t think this is right.</p>
<p>We believe in protecting your privacy</p>
<p>and giving you transparency and control</p>
<p>over your information.</p>
<p>And to tell you about the new ways</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re giving you even more control,</p>
<p>here are Katie and Erik.</p>
<p>[Katie] Thanks, Craig.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with Mail.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re like me, you get a lot of marketing emails like this.</p>
<p>What you may not realize is that many of these emails</p>
<p>use invisible pixels</p>
<p>to collect information about your Mail activity,</p>
<p>like when you open a message and even your IP address.</p>
<p>We think you should be able to choose</p>
<p>whether to allow this or not.</p>
<p>So now in the Mail app,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re introducing Mail Privacy Protection.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what it does.</p>
<p>It hides your IP address so senders can&rsquo;t link it</p>
<p>to your other online activity or determine your location.</p>
<p>And it prevents senders</p>
<p>from seeing if and when you&rsquo;ve opened their email.</p>
<p>So now you can catch up on email with greater peace of mind.</p>
<p>[Erik] Safari leads the industry</p>
<p>in protecting you against cross-site tracking</p>
<p>with Intelligent Tracking Prevention,</p>
<p>and this year, we&rsquo;re making it even stronger</p>
<p>by also hiding your IP address from trackers</p>
<p>so they can&rsquo;t use it</p>
<p>to link your activity across different sites</p>
<p>or learn your location.</p>
<p>You can see which trackers are prevented from profiling you</p>
<p>in the Safari Privacy Report.</p>
<p>We wanted to bring this same transparency</p>
<p>to apps you use too.</p>
<p>[Katie] So we&rsquo;re introducing the App Privacy Report.</p>
<p>This new section in Settings</p>
<p>gives you an overview of how apps treat your privacy.</p>
<p>You can see how often apps use the permission you&rsquo;ve granted</p>
<p>to access your location, photos, camera, microphone,</p>
<p>contacts, and more, during the last 7 days.</p>
<p>And to find out who your data may be shared with,</p>
<p>you can see all the third party domains the app is contacting.</p>
<p>So these are our new privacy system controls.</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s talk about Siri.</p>
<p>Siri&rsquo;s available across all your Apple devices,</p>
<p>allowing you to quickly get things done</p>
<p>with just your voice.</p>
<p>And Siri is being used more than ever</p>
<p>on over 600 million devices each month.</p>
<p>We recently added more diverse Siri voice options,</p>
<p>and they sound incredible.</p>
<p>[Siri] Hi, I&rsquo;m Siri. If you need anything, just ask.</p>
<p>[Katie] Now, Siri has a ton of great new features this year,</p>
<p>but today we want to focus on a major update to privacy.</p>
<p>[Erik] Siri&rsquo;s designed to process</p>
<p>as much data on device as possible,</p>
<p>keeping your information private,</p>
<p>and with the power of the Neural Engine,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re able to do this more than ever.</p>
<p>Today we&rsquo;re introducing on-device speech recognition.</p>
<p>This means that, by default,</p>
<p>your audio is all processed right on your iPhone or iPad.</p>
<p>This addresses the biggest privacy concern we hear</p>
<p>for voice assistants, which is unwanted audio recording.</p>
<p>And this has some great benefits beyond privacy.</p>
<p>First, you can now make many requests</p>
<p>without an internet connection:</p>
<p>launch apps, change settings, control music, and more.</p>
<p>Second, on-device processing speeds things up.</p>
<p>Check this out.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll do a few requests back to back.</p>
<p>Open Photos.</p>
<p>Open Calendar.</p>
<p>Turn on Airplane Mode.</p>
<p>Set a timer for 20 minutes.</p>
<p>Switch to dark mode.</p>
<p>Wake me up at 7:00 a.m.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s amazing how fast Siri is with on-device processing.</p>
<p>So those are some of the powerful</p>
<p>new privacy protections in Mail, Safari, and your apps,</p>
<p>along with on-device speech recognition for Siri.</p>
<p>Back to you, Craig.</p>
<p>[Craig] Next, another part of our ecosystem</p>
<p>that puts your privacy first is iCloud.</p>
<p>Here to tell you about some great new updates is Mike.</p>
<p>[upbeat music]</p>
<p>‚ô™ ‚ô™</p>
<p>[Mike] Many of us rely on iCloud</p>
<p>to safely store a lot of personal information,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s important to always have access.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s start off with two improvements</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re making to your Apple ID.</p>
<p>First, we&rsquo;re adding a new way to get back into your account</p>
<p>if you forget your password or get locked out.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll now have the option to add people you trust,</p>
<p>like your family and friends, to a Recovery Contact list.</p>
<p>They won&rsquo;t get any access to your account,</p>
<p>but if you ever forget your password,</p>
<p>you can call them to get the code you need</p>
<p>to get right back in.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fast, easy, and secure.</p>
<p>Second, we&rsquo;re launching a new Digital Legacy program.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t often think about it,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s important that we can easily pass down</p>
<p>information to family members or friends when we pass away.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll now be able to add people to your account</p>
<p>as Legacy Contacts.</p>
<p>So when you&rsquo;re gone, they can simply request access,</p>
<p>and your information can be passed along</p>
<p>quickly and easily.</p>
<p>iCloud has always kept your important information&ndash;</p>
<p>like photos, documents, and notes&ndash;</p>
<p>safe, up to date, and accessible across all of your devices,</p>
<p>and today, we&rsquo;re making some big updates.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re upgrading our paid subscription</p>
<p>to something that we call iCloud+.</p>
<p>iCloud+ combines everything you love about iCloud</p>
<p>with some great new features,</p>
<p>starting with something to help protect your privacy online.</p>
<p>On any given day, we all use a variety of networks</p>
<p>to browse the web:</p>
<p>from the internet in our own homes.</p>
<p>to public Wi-Fi on the go.</p>
<p>And behind the scenes, network providers and websites</p>
<p>can combine your identity and browsing history</p>
<p>into a detailed profile about you.</p>
<p>So now, in addition to everything that Safari does</p>
<p>to protect you online, we are introducing a new service</p>
<p>called Private Relay.</p>
<p>It lets you browse with Safari</p>
<p>in an even more secure and private way.</p>
<p>And the way it works is really cool.</p>
<p>It ensures that the traffic leaving your device is encrypted</p>
<p>so that no one can intercept and read it.</p>
<p>Then all of your requests</p>
<p>are sent through two separate internet relays.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s designed so that no one, including Apple,</p>
<p>can see both who you are</p>
<p>and what sites you&rsquo;re visiting,</p>
<p>and it does all this without compromising performance.</p>
<p>Next, let&rsquo;s talk about another iCloud+ feature: Hide My Email.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve all had moments when we&rsquo;ve thought twice</p>
<p>about sharing our personal email address,</p>
<p>like when we&rsquo;re filling out a form on the web.</p>
<p>With Hide My Email, you can share a unique, random address</p>
<p>that forwards messages to your personal inbox.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s built right into Mail, Safari, and iCloud Settings.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s easy to set up as many addresses as you need</p>
<p>and delete them at any time, keeping you in control.</p>
<p>iCloud+ also includes built-in support</p>
<p>for HomeKit Secure Video.</p>
<p>More and more of us are using security cameras</p>
<p>to keep an eye on our homes.</p>
<p>With iCloud+, you can connect more cameras than ever,</p>
<p>and none of the video counts against your iCloud storage.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a part of your subscription.</p>
<p>Of course, you&rsquo;ll still get</p>
<p>everything else you love about iCloud,</p>
<p>including Photos, Backup, and iCloud Drive.</p>
<p>And the best part is we&rsquo;re not changing our prices at all.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll get all of iCloud plus our new Private Relay service,</p>
<p>Hide My Email and expanded HomeKit secure video support</p>
<p>for the same low price as we offer today.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re really excited to be giving users</p>
<p>an even more private and connected experience</p>
<p>with iCloud+.</p>
<p>Now over to Sumbul for the latest developments in Health.</p>
<p>[upbeat music]</p>
<p>[Sumbul] Your health and the well-being of your family</p>
<p>is always important to you,</p>
<p>and never more so than this past year.</p>
<p>Apple&rsquo;s commitment to health is stronger than ever.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re collaborating with medical experts</p>
<p>to accelerate health innovation,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re empowering individuals to improve their health</p>
<p>as well as make it easier for them to participate</p>
<p>in large-scale research studies.</p>
<p>With our APIs,</p>
<p>developers are using our devices and Health app</p>
<p>to come up with ingenious ways to push things forward.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an example.</p>
<p>[Francoise] I‚Äôm Francoise Marvel.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm a cardiology fellow at Johns Hopkins.</p>
<p>[Seth] Seth Martin.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm also a cardiologist at Johns Hopkins.</p>
<p>[Francoise] Seth and I spend our days</p>
<p>alongside our patients at the bedside.</p>
<p>You know, six white coats, hovering over a bed.</p>
<p>And we‚Äôre trying to actually share</p>
<p>what the patient‚Äôs condition is.</p>
<p>How they need to improve their life.</p>
<p>We use medical jargon. We speak quickly.</p>
<p>We confuse patients.</p>
<p>And they‚Äôre left on their own.</p>
<p>There has to be a better way than just treating a patient,</p>
<p>handing them a bunch of papers, and expecting</p>
<p>that they‚Äôre gonna understand how to change their life.</p>
<p>We thought, well, what if we completely reengineer</p>
<p>the process for a heart attack patient, by using ResearchKit,</p>
<p>CareKit, HealthKit, and then connecting it</p>
<p>with an Apple Watch, so we can bring in</p>
<p>key cardiovascular metrics</p>
<p>that help us to know patients are doing well.</p>
<p>[Seth] When Francoise was in the technology accelerator program</p>
<p>at Hopkins, the work there led to this phone call with Apple</p>
<p>and towards the end of the phone call,</p>
<p>Francoise said to Divya at Apple, ‚ÄúWhat can we do</p>
<p>to accelerate this?‚Äù And Divya said&ndash;</p>
<p>[Divya] You guys gotta come out to Cupertino.</p>
<p>[Francoise] And we had a Silicon Valley AirBnB.</p>
<p>And we started side-by-side coding with our iOS developers,</p>
<p>and then every couple hours&ndash;</p>
<p>[Divya] We would talk about their vision</p>
<p>and tools they could leverage.</p>
<p>[Francoise] We‚Äôd go to a white board, and we‚Äôd lay out&ndash;</p>
<p>[Divya] Here are the things you guys should go tackle.</p>
<p>[Francoise] And we‚Äôd go back to our AirBnB, pour more coffee,</p>
<p>you know, order some bubble teas, eat some food.</p>
<p>And then we would go into Cupertino.</p>
<p>[Divya] They‚Äôd come back into Cupertino, piled in a minivan.</p>
<p>[Francoise] And spend like almost the full day there,</p>
<p>getting more feedback, working with their teams.</p>
<p>[Divya] They would leave our offices,</p>
<p>and work through the night</p>
<p>building and implementing the things we had talked about.</p>
<p>With our tools and their vision,</p>
<p>we ultimately made magic together.</p>
<p>[Francoise] We left Cupertino invigorated, and guess what?</p>
<p>Our clinical trial was able to save</p>
<p>an incredible amount of people from having complications</p>
<p>and coming back to the hospital.</p>
<p>And it reduced hospital readmissions by 52%.</p>
<p>And likely saved a lot of lives.</p>
<p>[Divya] I remember we were just sitting outside&ndash;</p>
<p>beautiful Cupertino weather.</p>
<p>And it was just one of those moments where it dawned on us</p>
<p>that Corrie app was going to have an impact</p>
<p>on so many people‚Äôs hearts around the world.</p>
<p>[Francoise] This is the start of something incredible.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs the spark, and now it‚Äôs like fire</p>
<p>[Sumbul] This is just one of the many inspiring stories out there</p>
<p>and is a testament to the innovative work happening</p>
<p>in the medical community.</p>
<p>A critical part of taking care of yourself</p>
<p>is monitoring changes in your health,</p>
<p>which can be subtle and easy to miss over time.</p>
<p>So this year, we&rsquo;re offering three new features</p>
<p>to help you to identify, measure,</p>
<p>and understand those changes, and here&rsquo;s Adeeti</p>
<p>to tell you about the first of these features.</p>
<p>[Adeeti] Let&rsquo;s start with mobility.</p>
<p>The way that you move and walk</p>
<p>can indicate balance issues and gait impairment.</p>
<p>This is the leading cause of falls in adults.</p>
<p>Currently, fall risk is assessed by a care provider</p>
<p>through a questionnaire and an in-person evaluation.</p>
<p>But this can miss out on your everyday movement,</p>
<p>so important changes can go unnoticed.</p>
<p>Your iPhone already captures mobility data as you walk</p>
<p>with scientifically validated metrics.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re building on this to introduce</p>
<p>a completely new way to assess your risk of falling</p>
<p>called Walking Steadiness.</p>
<p>For the first time ever,</p>
<p>you can get insight if your fall risk increases</p>
<p>and take action early to improve your steadiness.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a quick look at some of the science behind this.</p>
<p>As you walk with your iPhone, the built-in motion sensors</p>
<p>automatically measure how fast and how evenly you walk,</p>
<p>the length of your steps, and the timing of each step,</p>
<p>right down to how often you have both feet on the ground.</p>
<p>Combined, these metrics provide powerful insight</p>
<p>on changes in your balance, stability, and coordination.</p>
<p>We used real-world data</p>
<p>from the Apple Heart &amp; Movement Study,</p>
<p>with over 100,000 participants across all ages.</p>
<p>This is the largest data set ever used to study fall risk,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s helped create this first of its kind health metric.</p>
<p>You can view your Walking Steadiness in the Health app.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll see a classification of &ldquo;OK&rdquo;</p>
<p>if the metrics show that you&rsquo;re stable while walking.</p>
<p>You can see how your Walking Steadiness</p>
<p>may change as the months go by</p>
<p>and receive a notification if your steadiness is low</p>
<p>or very low and you&rsquo;re at increased risk of falling.</p>
<p>You can also learn how to improve your steadiness.</p>
<p>There are movement exercises right in the Health app,</p>
<p>and these can help you increase your strength and balance</p>
<p>and reduce your risk of falling.</p>
<p>Now back to Sumbul</p>
<p>to tell you about another way to monitor health changes.</p>
<p>[Sumbul] You can already review lab results</p>
<p>like your cholesterol right in the Health app.</p>
<p>In the U.S. alone, 14 billion clinical laboratory tests</p>
<p>are performed each year.</p>
<p>That is a lot of information to keep track of.</p>
<p>When you see your own results come in,</p>
<p>it can be hard to understand what these tests mean</p>
<p>or what has changed.</p>
<p>The Health app will now include detailed descriptions</p>
<p>to help you better understand your lab data.</p>
<p>For example, when you receive a cholesterol result,</p>
<p>you can now see that the LDL is a bad cholesterol</p>
<p>and having too much may put you at risk for heart disease.</p>
<p>You can also now see whether your labs</p>
<p>are within expected ranges.</p>
<p>Together, these views will help you</p>
<p>get even more meaning from your lab results.</p>
<p>Many health changes happen over time,</p>
<p>so to better understand your health</p>
<p>even more holistically, we&rsquo;re introducing Trends.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll get insight on long-term changes</p>
<p>across areas such as steps, resting heart rate,</p>
<p>blood glucose, sleep, and much more.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll also be alerted when there&rsquo;s a new trend</p>
<p>in your data, which may be something</p>
<p>you want to monitor more closely</p>
<p>or even discuss with your physician.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re getting more daily walks in,</p>
<p>your health summary will show</p>
<p>that your steps taken have increased</p>
<p>over the last few months.</p>
<p>This is a great way to celebrate progress</p>
<p>towards meeting your health goals</p>
<p>and a powerful new way to get early insight</p>
<p>into potential health issues.</p>
<p>With Trends, Walking Steadiness,</p>
<p>and a better Labs experience,</p>
<p>you have three new ways to see changes</p>
<p>in your overall health.</p>
<p>Another really important part of managing your health</p>
<p>is having meaningful conversations with your doctor.</p>
<p>During your visit, physicians look at your vitals and labs</p>
<p>but will also ask you about everyday health activities</p>
<p>like exercise and sleep.</p>
<p>And patients can often have difficulty</p>
<p>remembering all these details.</p>
<p>But the Health app has all of this valuable information,</p>
<p>so, to support this conversation,</p>
<p>you can now share health data that you choose</p>
<p>with your healthcare provider in a private way.</p>
<p>For example, if you have a concern about your heart health,</p>
<p>you can now share your heart data.</p>
<p>This is shared securely.</p>
<p>No one else, including Apple, will see this information.</p>
<p>Your doctor can then view this data directly</p>
<p>from their electronic health record system</p>
<p>and look for important trends such as changes in activity</p>
<p>and a history of alerts like high heart rate.</p>
<p>Access to this information helps give your doctor</p>
<p>a more complete view of your everyday health</p>
<p>outside of the clinic.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re so excited about this new capability</p>
<p>to share your data from the Health app</p>
<p>directly with your doctor.</p>
<p>These electronic health record companies in the U.S.</p>
<p>will be the first to support this feature,</p>
<p>and we look forward to expanding availability</p>
<p>even more in the coming months.</p>
<p>Now, for many of us, it&rsquo;s not just the changes</p>
<p>in our own health we care about.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the health of our family and loved ones too,</p>
<p>whether they live with us or far away.</p>
<p>For some of us, that means taking care of our kids</p>
<p>and for others, it&rsquo;s our aging parents.</p>
<p>And for many of us,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s actually taking care of both&ndash;</p>
<p>generations above and below.</p>
<p>To empower you to care for others,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re introducing Health Sharing,</p>
<p>a private and secure way to view health data,</p>
<p>trends, and alerts for the people most important to you.</p>
<p>For example, I could set up a sharing relationship</p>
<p>with my mom, and with her permission,</p>
<p>I could view data like her heart rate,</p>
<p>activity, and labs.</p>
<p>And just like with my own health data,</p>
<p>Trends proactively highlights changes in my Mom&rsquo;s health data</p>
<p>for me.</p>
<p>I can also receive notifications,</p>
<p>including high heart rate alerts,</p>
<p>changes in mobility, and more.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s easy for me to connect with her about her health.</p>
<p>So if I see a noteworthy change</p>
<p>like her resting heart rate increasing,</p>
<p>I can simply tap Messages</p>
<p>and start a conversation with my mom.</p>
<p>This is a powerful new way to stay connected</p>
<p>to the wellbeing of those you love.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll have peace of mind,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll know they have a trusted partner</p>
<p>on their health journey.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of our work in Health,</p>
<p>all of our health features have been architected</p>
<p>to keep your data secure and protect your privacy.</p>
<p>Your health data is under your control</p>
<p>and is encrypted in transit and at rest.</p>
<p>The permissions built into the sharing experience</p>
<p>give you granular control</p>
<p>over which types of data you share and with whom.</p>
<p>And you can make changes at any time</p>
<p>right from the Sharing tab.</p>
<p>Data you share is sent in an encrypted form,</p>
<p>and Apple does not have access to any of this information.</p>
<p>Privacy is fundamental in the design and development</p>
<p>across all of our Health features.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re so excited for what&rsquo;s coming in Health&ndash;</p>
<p>a first-of-its-kind metric to access fall risk,</p>
<p>richer insights to understand changes in your health,</p>
<p>and completely new abilities for you to privately share</p>
<p>selected data with your doctors and loved ones.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;ll hand it over to Kevin to talk about watchOS.</p>
<p>[Kevin] Apple Watch is already</p>
<p>the most loved watch in the world.</p>
<p>It keeps you healthy, active, and connected.</p>
<p>With features like Fall Detection,</p>
<p>ECG, and Cycle Tracking,</p>
<p>Apple Watch is an essential health companion.</p>
<p>It motivates you to close your Activity rings</p>
<p>and transforms the way you stay fit.</p>
<p>And staying connected to the people and things</p>
<p>you care about most is easy with Apple Watch&ndash;</p>
<p>all from your wrist.</p>
<p>In watchOS 8, we&rsquo;re introducing more capabilities</p>
<p>in each of these areas.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with health.</p>
<p>More than ever, people are realizing</p>
<p>the importance of dedicating time to practice mindfulness.</p>
<p>In fact, the Breathe app has grown in popularity,</p>
<p>particularly over this last year.</p>
<p>In watchOS 8, the Breathe app has been enhanced</p>
<p>to give you more opportunities</p>
<p>to slow down and be mindful, including a new animation</p>
<p>that has a beautiful look and feel</p>
<p>to help you center and calm as you breathe.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re also introducing Reflect&ndash;</p>
<p>a new way for you to be more mindful.</p>
<p>For example, a reflection could be</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think about something you love to do</p>
<p>and why it brings you joy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A gentle animation helps you focus.</p>
<p>And studies show that regular mindful moments like this</p>
<p>can lead to increased positive emotions</p>
<p>and overall psychological well-being.</p>
<p>The Reflect and Breathe sessions live in the new Mindfulness app.</p>
<p>This will help you reduce stress and relax your body and mind.</p>
<p>With the Sleep app,</p>
<p>we introduced an entirely new way</p>
<p>for you to meet your sleep goals</p>
<p>and track metrics like time asleep,</p>
<p>heart rate, and even blood oxygen.</p>
<p>In watchOS 8,</p>
<p>Apple Watch can track another key metric</p>
<p>while sleeping&ndash;</p>
<p>Respiratory Rate.</p>
<p>This is a vital sign that measures</p>
<p>how many breaths you take per minute.</p>
<p>And since your sleeping respiratory rate</p>
<p>tends to be consistent over time,</p>
<p>a change may indicate a shift in your overall wellness.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll be notified if a meaningful trend</p>
<p>in your respiratory rate has been identified.</p>
<p>And you can see even more details</p>
<p>in Respiratory Rate in the Health app.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;d like to turn it over to Julz</p>
<p>to tell you what&rsquo;s coming to help you stay active.</p>
<p>[Julz] Apple Watch is the perfect companion</p>
<p>to motivate you to be more fit.</p>
<p>And watchOS 8 adds two of the most popular workout types</p>
<p>that are great for bringing more mindful movement</p>
<p>to your routine.</p>
<p>First, a new Tai Chi workout.</p>
<p>This Chinese martial art is thousands of years old</p>
<p>and is often described as meditation in motion.</p>
<p>Its gentle approach can help reduce stress</p>
<p>and find a more peaceful state of mind.</p>
<p>And a brand-new Pilates workout type,</p>
<p>which is one of the best ways to develop core strength,</p>
<p>posture, balance, and flexibility.</p>
<p>Of course, another way people are staying fit</p>
<p>is with Apple Fitness+,</p>
<p>the first service built entirely around Apple Watch.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve heard from so many of our users</p>
<p>how it&rsquo;s making a positive difference in their lives.</p>
<p>And now, Fitness+ is introducing a new series of workouts</p>
<p>featuring Jeanette Jenkins,</p>
<p>one of the most sought after fitness experts.</p>
<p>With seven workouts focused on Strength</p>
<p>and High Intensity Interval Training,</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s bringing the fire</p>
<p>and her belief that all bodies are made to be strong.</p>
<p>Because music is so key to the Fitness+ experience,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re introducing a new Artist Spotlight Series.</p>
<p>Each workout features an entire playlist</p>
<p>from Lady Gaga, Jennifer Lopez,</p>
<p>Keith Urban, and Alicia Keys.</p>
<p>The Artist Spotlight Series and the new workouts with Jeanette</p>
<p>will be available later this month.</p>
<p>With new workout types and great new Fitness+ content,</p>
<p>Apple Watch continues to be an incredible motivator</p>
<p>to help you stay active and fit.</p>
<p>Back to you, Kevin.</p>
<p>[Kevin] Let&rsquo;s talk about some new features</p>
<p>to keep you connected to the people you love.</p>
<p>Photos are a great way to relive your favorite moments</p>
<p>and most precious memories.</p>
<p>On Apples Watch, the Photos face</p>
<p>is the most popular Watch face.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why watchOS 8 is bringing another great way</p>
<p>to enjoy your favorite photos</p>
<p>with the new Portraits Watch face.</p>
<p>It takes the great portrait photos from your iPhone</p>
<p>and uses the segmentation data</p>
<p>to create a multi-layered face with depth.</p>
<p>And you can make this watch face your own</p>
<p>by adjusting the photo&rsquo;s composition and time placement</p>
<p>to really make the subject stand out.</p>
<p>This is really great to see live,</p>
<p>so let me invite Shandra to show you a demo.</p>
<p>[Shandra] Thanks, Kevin.</p>
<p>Your photo comes to life when you raise your wrist.</p>
<p>And as you scroll the digital crown,</p>
<p>you get a view of the dynamic composition</p>
<p>that makes this watch face extraordinary.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna love how this face keeps you connected</p>
<p>when you can&rsquo;t be face-to-face.</p>
<p>Speaking of photos,</p>
<p>the Photos app itself has been completely redesigned.</p>
<p>It now includes memory highlights,</p>
<p>featured photos, in addition to your favorites.</p>
<p>If I tap into this memory,</p>
<p>I can scroll through the all-new mosaic layout.</p>
<p>My daughter Wesleigh and I</p>
<p>adopted our puppy Fondue last year</p>
<p>and are missing her during the day.</p>
<p>The new Photos app makes it simple for us</p>
<p>to quickly reminisce.</p>
<p>This picture from my Memories is a good one.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna share it with Wesleigh to remind her</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not always missing Fondue&rsquo;s best moments.</p>
<p>If I tap the share icon,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll see that we now have support for sharing photos</p>
<p>via messages and mail, directly from my Watch.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s get this over to Wesleigh.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna tap add message to show you</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve made it even easier to compose a message.</p>
<p>We can now dictate, Scribble,</p>
<p>and add emojis in the same view.</p>
<p>I always find it easy to dictate my messages.</p>
<p>Remember this?</p>
<p>If I tap Scribble, I can edit my text inline</p>
<p>by selecting and deleting what I&rsquo;d like to change.</p>
<p>And I can use the crown to move the cursor</p>
<p>and add additional text.</p>
<p>And what message is complete without emojis</p>
<p>to get a point across?</p>
<p>By tapping the emoji icon, I can add multiple emojis</p>
<p>while in the Scribble view.</p>
<p>watchOS 8 makes it easy to send the perfect message</p>
<p>right from your wrist.</p>
<p>[chime] That was quick.</p>
<p>Wesleigh must have the puppy on the brain too.</p>
<p>And with GIFs now on Apple Watch,</p>
<p>I can reply as comedically as I would from my iPhone.</p>
<p>In the new app shelf, you&rsquo;ll find #images.</p>
<p>You can search for the perfect GIF</p>
<p>or choose from your recents.</p>
<p>I think a face palm best captures</p>
<p>how this photo makes me feel.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a look at what&rsquo;s coming in watchOS 8</p>
<p>to keep you connected to the people</p>
<p>and puppies you care about most.</p>
<p>And now, back to Kevin.</p>
<p>[Kevin] We think you&rsquo;re gonna love these new features</p>
<p>in Photos and Messages.</p>
<p>And of course, there&rsquo;s so much more,</p>
<p>including Next Hour Precipitation,</p>
<p>support for Find Items, and Multiple Timers.</p>
<p>watchOS is the world&rsquo;s most advanced</p>
<p>wearable operating system.</p>
<p>And watchOS 8 takes it even further</p>
<p>with new features to help you stay healthy,</p>
<p>active, and connected.</p>
<p>And now, over to Craig.</p>
<p>[electronic music]</p>
<p>‚ô™ ‚ô™</p>
<p>[Craig] Let&rsquo;s talk about the home.</p>
<p>At Apple, we design our products for the home</p>
<p>to embody three key attributes</p>
<p>starting with being easy to use.</p>
<p>We believe the technology in your home</p>
<p>should work for you, not the other way around.</p>
<p>And we design our products to work better together</p>
<p>so that your iPhone, HomePod mini,</p>
<p>Apple TV, and other devices</p>
<p>can leverage each other to deliver seamless experiences.</p>
<p>And everything we do is built to be private and secure,</p>
<p>which is so important to all of us.</p>
<p>With this foundation, we have a great set of features</p>
<p>coming this year to make life at home more enjoyable.</p>
<p>To tell you more, here&rsquo;s Yah.</p>
<p>At the heart of your smart home is HomeKit,</p>
<p>seamlessly orchestrating and controlling</p>
<p>your smart home accessories.</p>
<p>And it all starts at your front door.</p>
<p>With our new Home Keys feature,</p>
<p>simply tap your iPhone or Apple Watch</p>
<p>to securely unlock the door, just like that.</p>
<p>Now, sometimes when you get home,</p>
<p>you just can&rsquo;t wait to watch your favorite show,</p>
<p>so we&rsquo;ve made that easier than ever.</p>
<p>Starting this fall, you can ask Siri on HomePod mini</p>
<p>to play something on your Apple TV&ndash;</p>
<p>completely hands-free.</p>
<p>[mom] Hey, Siri, watch the latest episode</p>
<p>of Mosquito Coast.</p>
<p>[Siri] Here&rsquo;s season one, episode seven of Mosquito Coast.</p>
<p>[Yah] For many of us, the only thing better than watching TV</p>
<p>is watching TV with friends.</p>
<p>As you heard from Craig earlier,</p>
<p>SharePlay is going to change the way you enjoy TV together.</p>
<p>You can watch it all on Apple TV,</p>
<p>in sync with your friends on FaceTime,</p>
<p>ensuring everyone catches the movie&rsquo;s dramatic reveal</p>
<p>or a show&rsquo;s punchline at the same moment.</p>
<p>And to make it easier to see everything</p>
<p>your friends are talking about,</p>
<p>the Apple TV app will now feature a new</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shared with You&rdquo; row,</p>
<p>highlighting all the great shows and movies</p>
<p>your friends are sharing in Messages.</p>
<p>We also want to make it easier to decide</p>
<p>what to watch as a group,</p>
<p>especially if Mom&rsquo;s into action movies,</p>
<p>Grandma loves sci-fi,</p>
<p>and the teens can&rsquo;t get enough of comedy.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re introducing a new row called</p>
<p>&ldquo;For All of You,&rdquo; with a collection of shows</p>
<p>and movies based on everyone&rsquo;s interests&ndash;</p>
<p>perfect for family movie nights.</p>
<p>And you can easily fine tune the suggestions</p>
<p>based on who&rsquo;s watching.</p>
<p>Now, when you&rsquo;re ready to watch something,</p>
<p>you want it to sound amazing.</p>
<p>So this fall, you can select HomePod mini</p>
<p>as the speakers for your Apple TV 4K.</p>
<p>With the power of Computational Audio,</p>
<p>HomePod mini delivers rich, balanced sound</p>
<p>and crystal-clear dialogue for everything you watch.</p>
<p>[Yah] HomePod mini is perfect for any room,</p>
<p>like the Kitchen, where you can convert measurements,</p>
<p>set a timer, or add to your grocery list.</p>
<p>Of course, you can always listen to Apple music</p>
<p>and other popular music services.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re excited to add support</p>
<p>for lossless audio, Apple Music, later this year.</p>
<p>Because we want more people</p>
<p>to experience the magic of HomePod mini,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re now making it available in even more countries and regions.</p>
<p>In addition to everywhere we ship HomePod mini today,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re bringing it to Austria,</p>
<p>Ireland, and New Zealand this month.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;ll be available in Italy by the end of the year.</p>
<p>Also later this year,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll begin bringing voice recognition</p>
<p>everywhere HomePod mini ships,</p>
<p>giving each member of the home a personalized experience.</p>
<p>So each person can ask Siri to send a message,</p>
<p>set their own reminders,</p>
<p>or hear a playlist curated just for them.</p>
<p>We believe Siri is most powerful</p>
<p>when it&rsquo;s available throughout your house,</p>
<p>which is why we&rsquo;re so excited</p>
<p>to bring Siri to third-party devices.</p>
<p>For the first time, HomeKit accessory makers</p>
<p>can enable Siri in their products,</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;ll be able to talk with Siri</p>
<p>on even more devices.</p>
<p>[grandma] Hey, Siri, set the Dinner scene.</p>
<p>[Yah] We&rsquo;ve designed it so that your Siri requests</p>
<p>flow to your HomePod</p>
<p>without going to any third-party servers,</p>
<p>providing the privacy you expect from Apple.</p>
<p>Accessories enabled with Siri</p>
<p>will be available starting later this year.</p>
<p>And, to make your smart home accessories</p>
<p>work together seamlessly, we formed an alliance</p>
<p>with other industry leaders</p>
<p>to create a new smart home interoperability standard</p>
<p>called Matter.</p>
<p>It leverages the HomeKit technology</p>
<p>we open-sourced last year,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re excited to announce</p>
<p>that support is coming in iOS 15.</p>
<p>You can control HomeKit and Matter-enabled accessories</p>
<p>with the Home app.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s available across your Apple devices,</p>
<p>and this year, we&rsquo;re making it even better</p>
<p>on Apple Watch.</p>
<p>You can tap Intercom to broadcast a message</p>
<p>or quickly access the accessories</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re most likely to need in that moment.</p>
<p>You can even see what&rsquo;s going on around the house.</p>
<p>With the HomeKit-enabled doorbell,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s easy to see who&rsquo;s at the door</p>
<p>and greet them right from your wrist.</p>
<p>HomeKit Secure Video uses the on-device intelligence</p>
<p>of your Apple TV or HomePod mini</p>
<p>to alert you when people, animals, or vehicles</p>
<p>are detected.</p>
<p>And this year, we&rsquo;re adding Package Detection</p>
<p>so you know when a package has arrived.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re adding new ways</p>
<p>to take advantage of your cameras on Apple TV.</p>
<p>While viewing a camera,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll now be able to control nearby accessories</p>
<p>such as turning on the outdoor lights.</p>
<p>And you can even display multiple cameras</p>
<p>at the same time, giving you a more complete view</p>
<p>of what&rsquo;s happening around the house.</p>
<p>Those are just some of the great experiences</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re bringing to the home this fall.</p>
<p>With incredible new features like Home Keys,</p>
<p>SharePlay for shared viewing,</p>
<p>and access to Siri in more places than ever before,</p>
<p>your smart home has never been more capable.</p>
<p>Back to Craig.</p>
<p>[upbeat music]</p>
<p>‚ô™ ‚ô™</p>
<p>[Craig] Let&rsquo;s talk about macOS.</p>
<p>macOS has always been about the fusion of power and simplicity.</p>
<p>And with our current release,</p>
<p>macOS Big Sur, we introduced a bold new design</p>
<p>that gives users more control and huge updates for apps&ndash;</p>
<p>all while making everything easier to use.</p>
<p>And when combined with the M1 chip,</p>
<p>Big Sur delivers unmatched levels of performance</p>
<p>and battery life.</p>
<p>With people using the Mac more than ever,</p>
<p>macOS has become an even bigger part of our daily lives.</p>
<p>And our next release is focused on helping you</p>
<p>do even more.</p>
<p>But what should we call it?</p>
<p>Well, that brings us to the latest exploits</p>
<p>of our crack marketing team.</p>
<p>With their annual vision quest postponed,</p>
<p>our merry band of nomadic namers</p>
<p>wandered aimlessly through the California hills</p>
<p>before donning their technicolor wet suits</p>
<p>and immersing themselves in the inspiration</p>
<p>of the beautiful, rich waters of Monterey.</p>
<p>macOS Monterey gives you the power</p>
<p>to accomplish more than ever</p>
<p>and helps you work fluidly across all your devices.</p>
<p>The incredible features we talked about earlier</p>
<p>are going to be great for the ways you work on Mac,</p>
<p>like the new capabilities in FaceTime</p>
<p>which help you look and sound your best</p>
<p>while talking to coworkers or friends.</p>
<p>With SharePlay, it&rsquo;s just plain awesome</p>
<p>to watch movies and shows together</p>
<p>on your stunning Mac display</p>
<p>or share an app window as you collaborate on a project.</p>
<p>Shared with You offers a totally new way</p>
<p>to discover photos, articles and more</p>
<p>that people share with you over Messages</p>
<p>right in your Mac apps.</p>
<p>And when you&rsquo;re working hard on a Mac,</p>
<p>you can choose a Focus that syncs across all your devices,</p>
<p>helping reduce distracting notifications</p>
<p>so you can get the job done.</p>
<p>Plus, Quick Note and Notes</p>
<p>give you versatile new ways to capture</p>
<p>and organize your thoughts.</p>
<p>These powerful features are just fantastic on the Mac.</p>
<p>And we have even more new features</p>
<p>that make it easier to work across all your devices,</p>
<p>starting with Continuity.</p>
<p>Every device we make is powerful in its own way,</p>
<p>and when you use them together</p>
<p>you unlock new experiences that feel truly magical.</p>
<p>This year, we&rsquo;ve created a completely new way</p>
<p>to work across your devices</p>
<p>with greater precision and speed, and we call it&ndash;</p>
<p>Universal Control.</p>
<p>With Universal Control,</p>
<p>you can now use a single mouse and keyboard</p>
<p>to move between your Mac and iPad</p>
<p>for a seamless experience.</p>
<p>Universal Control is so incredible,</p>
<p>you just have to see it in action.</p>
<p>Let me show it to you now.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m putting the final touches on an illustration</p>
<p>here on my iPad.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the last piece I need to finish a presentation</p>
<p>that I have open on my MacBook.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;ll just set my iPad down next to my Mac,</p>
<p>and check this out.</p>
<p>Without any other setup,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna simply move my Mac cursor</p>
<p>towards my iPad,</p>
<p>and the iPad automatically recognizes it.</p>
<p>And if I move a bit further,</p>
<p>boom&ndash;my cursor is now on the iPad.</p>
<p>How cool is that?</p>
<p>And now I can move my cursor back and forth effortlessly</p>
<p>between the two.</p>
<p>Now, it&rsquo;s easy to control my iPad</p>
<p>with just the keyboard and trackpad on my Mac.</p>
<p>For instance, I can click and close this document,</p>
<p>and flick on my trackpad</p>
<p>to return to my iPad home screen.</p>
<p>And of course, I can swipe between my pages of apps,</p>
<p>And I can use my MacBook&rsquo;s keyboard</p>
<p>to open Spotlight and, say, launch Notes.</p>
<p>And I can even use command-tab</p>
<p>to switch right back to Procreate.</p>
<p>This is really powerful.</p>
<p>With Universal Control,</p>
<p>I can even drag and drop files between my devices.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just gonna take this drawing I finished on my iPad</p>
<p>and drop it into my Keynote on my Mac.</p>
<p>Awesome.</p>
<p>For our pros out there,</p>
<p>Universal Control works with more than two devices.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s add this iMac to the mix.</p>
<p>Now I can use the trackpad on my MacBook</p>
<p>to control my iMac as well.</p>
<p>I can also switch to my iMac&rsquo;s keyboard and mouse.</p>
<p>This is so cool. Watch this.</p>
<p>Now, I have a title text image I&rsquo;ve been working on here</p>
<p>in Procreate on my iPad.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m gonna take this image</p>
<p>and drag it across all three devices</p>
<p>and drop it into FinalCut.</p>
<p>Just like that.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see the final product.</p>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a quick look at Universal Control</p>
<p>on macOS Monterey.</p>
<p>Universal Control makes it effortless</p>
<p>to move between your devices</p>
<p>so you can be more productive and focus your energy</p>
<p>on the task at hand.</p>
<p>Another way our devices work great together</p>
<p>is with AirPlay.</p>
<p>We all love the way AirPlay lets us watch a movie</p>
<p>or share a presentation</p>
<p>from your iPhone to a TV just like that.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s another screen with its stunning Retina display</p>
<p>that makes everything you watch simply amazing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re introducing</p>
<p>AirPlay to Mac.</p>
<p>It works just like AirPlay today,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s instantly familiar.</p>
<p>You can play, present, and share just about anything.</p>
<p>As you draw a sketch on iPad,</p>
<p>your colleagues can follow along on the bigger display.</p>
<p>And you can even take advantage of any Mac&rsquo;s high-fidelity sound</p>
<p>by using it as an AirPlay speaker.</p>
<p>AirPlay brings your Mac to life in whole new ways.</p>
<p>With macOS Monterey,</p>
<p>your devices work together like never before,</p>
<p>making it more fluid to work across them.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re not just reinventing how you work between devices.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re also giving you powerful new tools</p>
<p>to get more work done on your devices.</p>
<p>The Mac has a long, deep history of automation</p>
<p>with Command line, shell scripts,</p>
<p>AppleScript, and Automator.</p>
<p>And on iOS, we&rsquo;ve made automation even easier</p>
<p>with Shortcuts.</p>
<p>Shortcuts takes all the taps and swipes you usually need</p>
<p>to order your favorite lunch</p>
<p>and makes it as simple as tapping a button</p>
<p>or asking Siri.</p>
<p>Shortcuts is all about helping you get more done&ndash;</p>
<p>faster.</p>
<p>Because you can let your device do the work for you.</p>
<p>And this year, we&rsquo;re bringing Shortcuts to the Mac.</p>
<p>The Mac is, after all,</p>
<p>where we turn for so much of our creative work.</p>
<p>And now you can automate the everyday stuff</p>
<p>to achieve peak productivity.</p>
<p>You get access to a rich gallery of pre-built shortcuts</p>
<p>designed just for Mac.</p>
<p>You can set up a shortcut to instantly share selected files</p>
<p>with your friends so they never miss a moment.</p>
<p>And with the Shortcuts Editor,</p>
<p>you can easily link together a series of actions</p>
<p>to design shortcuts for your specific workflows.</p>
<p>For instance, if you&rsquo;re a designer,</p>
<p>get right to work with a shortcut</p>
<p>that opens Pinterest in one window,</p>
<p>Affinity Photo in another,</p>
<p>and starts your favorite playlist in Apple Music.</p>
<p>All in one click.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve weaved Shortcuts throughout macOS,</p>
<p>so you can run them no matter what app is open.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re in Finder, the Menu Bar,</p>
<p>Spotlight, and of course,</p>
<p>you can ask Siri to run them hands-free.</p>
<p>Shortcuts is the future of automation on Mac,</p>
<p>and this is just the start of a multi-year transition.</p>
<p>Automator will continue to be supported,</p>
<p>and you can import Automator workflows into Shortcuts</p>
<p>beginning day one.</p>
<p>With Shortcuts, there are more ways than ever</p>
<p>to create, express yourself,</p>
<p>and get stuff done.</p>
<p>Finally, we have some really big news</p>
<p>about an app that&rsquo;s central to the Mac experience&ndash;</p>
<p>Safari.</p>
<p>We built Safari from the very beginning</p>
<p>to provide the best browsing experience on Mac,</p>
<p>and it continues to blow the competition out of the water.</p>
<p>Safari is the world&rsquo;s fastest browser.</p>
<p>It makes navigating even the most complex websites</p>
<p>lightning fast.</p>
<p>And Safari is known for its legendary power efficiency.</p>
<p>On an M1 MacBook Pro,</p>
<p>Safari users can get up to 17 hours of browsing</p>
<p>And of course, Safari sets the bar</p>
<p>for user privacy on the web</p>
<p>with features like Privacy Report</p>
<p>and Intelligent Tracking Prevention.</p>
<p>Our users are doing more in the browser than ever before&ndash;</p>
<p>work, school, shopping, and entertainment.</p>
<p>And that often leaves them with a lot of tabs, windows,</p>
<p>and other distractions.</p>
<p>We think using the browser should feel natural</p>
<p>and uncluttered,</p>
<p>so we&rsquo;ve reimagined the browsing experience.</p>
<p>We distilled the toolbar to is essential elements.</p>
<p>Tabs are more compact, modern, and lightweight.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a completely new way to use tabs</p>
<p>with Tab Groups.</p>
<p>They allow you to easily save and manage your tabs</p>
<p>without cluttering up your tab bar.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll hand it over to Beth to show it in action.</p>
<p>[Beth] Thanks, Craig.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with Safari&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gorgeous new tab design.</p>
<p>All of my tabs are right here in the new streamlined tab bar.</p>
<p>One of the really cool things we did this year</p>
<p>is we built the search field right into the active tab.</p>
<p>Safari is more space efficient than ever,</p>
<p>and I can see more of the page.</p>
<p>I can click on the active tab to see the page&rsquo;s full address,</p>
<p>and then I can search right from here.</p>
<p>Reader is in the tab bar whenever I need it,</p>
<p>and everything else is right here in the More menu.</p>
<p>Check this out. As I switch tabs,</p>
<p>the tab bar takes on the color of the site that I&rsquo;m viewing,</p>
<p>so it feels like a part of the page.</p>
<p>It looks beautiful.</p>
<p>Next, I&rsquo;m so excited to tell you about Tab Groups.</p>
<p>Tab Groups are an easy and lightweight way</p>
<p>to save your tabs and pick them back up later.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll open the new redesigned side bar,</p>
<p>and I have a few Tab Groups here already.</p>
<p>Each of these groups is a whole set of tabs.</p>
<p>I use them for meal planning,</p>
<p>for news,</p>
<p>and gift shopping.</p>
<p>Here in my open tabs,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m planning a road trip to Los Angeles,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m not done with my research yet.</p>
<p>I can save these into a Tab Group</p>
<p>and come back to it later.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll click the new Tab Group button</p>
<p>and call this Trip to L.A.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s so powerful about Tab Groups</p>
<p>is that they&rsquo;re on all of my devices.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got my MacBook here, and look.</p>
<p>My new Tab Group is here already.</p>
<p>As I make changes to my Tab Groups,</p>
<p>they update everywhere.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna open a bunch of tabs,</p>
<p>and my iMac just keeps up.</p>
<p>And if I change my current tab,</p>
<p>my Tab Group is always up to date,</p>
<p>and I never miss a thing.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t wait to share these trip ideas with my family,</p>
<p>and I can just drag this Tab Group into an email</p>
<p>and send it off.</p>
<p>Once you start using Tab Groups,</p>
<p>we know you&rsquo;re going to wanna get to them all the time.</p>
<p>So we made it super easy to switch from right here</p>
<p>in the tab bar.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the new Safari on Mac.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t stop there, though.</p>
<p>Back to Craig to tell you more.</p>
<p>[Craig] Thanks, Beth.</p>
<p>When we were designing the new tab experience,</p>
<p>we wanted to build something that worked consistently</p>
<p>when you switch from your Mac to your iPhone or iPad.</p>
<p>On iPad, the new tabs and tab bar</p>
<p>work just like they do on Mac.</p>
<p>Tab Groups are especially helpful on iPad,</p>
<p>and the instant syncing</p>
<p>means that you can continue a project from anywhere.</p>
<p>On iPhone, we&rsquo;ve done something really special.</p>
<p>We took all the thinking that went into Mac and iPad</p>
<p>and pushed the envelope even further.</p>
<p>For this smaller screen size,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re introducing something that&rsquo;s easier to reach</p>
<p>and maximizes the page onscreen.</p>
<p>The new tab bar appears with just a tap</p>
<p>and fits directly under your thumb.</p>
<p>And when you scroll, the bar moves seamlessly out of the way.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s now easier and more natural to access your other tabs too.</p>
<p>You can just swipe over on the tab bar</p>
<p>to quickly move between them.</p>
<p>Or swipe up on the tab bar</p>
<p>to reveal a brand-new grid view of all your tabs</p>
<p>plus your Tab Groups.</p>
<p>When you get to the end of your tabs,</p>
<p>you can swipe again to open a new one,</p>
<p>and the new customizable start page syncs with Mac</p>
<p>so you have the same Safari experience everywhere.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s one last feature</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re really excited to share&ndash;</p>
<p>Extensions.</p>
<p>Mac users love to deeply customize Safari</p>
<p>with extensions like Grammarly,</p>
<p>Honey, and Momentum.</p>
<p>And now, we&rsquo;re bringing web extensions to iPhone and iPad.</p>
<p>Just like on Mac, you choose what websites</p>
<p>you want extensions to be active on,</p>
<p>and developers can easily tap into</p>
<p>and entirely new audience</p>
<p>because these extensions can share code</p>
<p>with existing Safari web extensions.</p>
<p>This is a huge year for Safari.</p>
<p>A totally new tab design and Tab Groups</p>
<p>simplify your browsing.</p>
<p>And Safari is more customizable than ever</p>
<p>with the new start page</p>
<p>and extensions on iOS and iPadOS.</p>
<p>And with that,</p>
<p>we have macOS Monterey.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a fantastic release with great new features</p>
<p>that help Mac users do more than ever.</p>
<p>You can work across Mac and your other devices</p>
<p>using Universal Control and AirPlay to Mac.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy to get productive and creative using Shortcuts</p>
<p>and a totally new design for Safari,</p>
<p>along with incredible features like SharePlay,</p>
<p>Shared with You, Focus, and Quick Note.</p>
<p>We do have more to share with you,</p>
<p>but first, let&rsquo;s get outta here.</p>
<p>[upbeat music]</p>
<p>Probably should&rsquo;ve just taken the car.</p>
<p>As I mentioned a moment ago,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve made incredible advances in macOS</p>
<p>and across all of our platforms this year.</p>
<p>These are going to be amazing for users,</p>
<p>but they also create new opportunities</p>
<p>for our developers,</p>
<p>the heart and soul of WWDC.</p>
<p>And to tell you about the new developer features,</p>
<p>and technologies we&rsquo;ve been building</p>
<p>to help you take your apps to the next level,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s our VP of WWDR,</p>
<p>Susan Prescott.</p>
<p>[Susan] It&rsquo;s such a privilege to come together</p>
<p>with our developer community</p>
<p>and to connect with your creative energy.</p>
<p>Over the course of the week, Apple engineers</p>
<p>are gonna share all kinds of exciting new technologies</p>
<p>and features that we think you&rsquo;re gonna love.</p>
<p>And there are a few announcements</p>
<p>that we just couldn&rsquo;t wait to share&ndash;</p>
<p>APIs that&rsquo;ll help you create even more incredible apps,</p>
<p>Swift features that make the language</p>
<p>both easier and more powerful,</p>
<p>and App Store features</p>
<p>that&rsquo;ll help you better connect with users.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with APIs,</p>
<p>and there are a lot of new APIs this year.</p>
<p>Like the ones for SharePlay</p>
<p>that make it possible to build new shared experiences</p>
<p>for iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple TV.</p>
<p>And system-level enhancements like Voice Isolation,</p>
<p>Wide Spectrum audio, and Portrait Mode</p>
<p>that can work in any videoconferencing app.</p>
<p>New APIs for Focus and Notifications.</p>
<p>A new extra-large widget size for iPad.</p>
<p>The Screen Time API,</p>
<p>Always-On apps for watchOS.</p>
<p>New advanced rendering APIs in RealityKit.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve gone even further in this release</p>
<p>to make it easy for all developers</p>
<p>to create realistic 3D objects with Object Capture.</p>
<p>Object Capture is a revolutionary new API</p>
<p>on macOS.</p>
<p>Rather than manually creating 3D models which can take weeks,</p>
<p>Object Capture uses photogrammetry</p>
<p>to turn a series of 2D images</p>
<p>into photorealistic 3D objects in just minutes.</p>
<p>Leading developers like Maxon and Unity</p>
<p>are already using Object Capture</p>
<p>to unlock entirely new ways of creating 3D content.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s as simple as taking photos of an object</p>
<p>on your iPhone or iPad,</p>
<p>then importing them into Cinema 4D</p>
<p>to create a lifelike 3D model.</p>
<p>For the first time, developers can generate</p>
<p>an AR preview of the model</p>
<p>to ensure they&rsquo;ve captured what they need</p>
<p>while on location.</p>
<p>And Wayfair is using Object Capture</p>
<p>to develop tools for their manufacturers</p>
<p>so they can use an iPhone and Mac</p>
<p>to easily create a virtual representation</p>
<p>of their merchandise.</p>
<p>This will allow Wayfair users</p>
<p>to preview more products in their homes with AR</p>
<p>to make sure they choose the right product for their space.</p>
<p>This is a massive step forward for 3D content creation.</p>
<p>What used to be the most difficult</p>
<p>and expensive part of building AR experiences and 3D scenes</p>
<p>is now available to all developers in macOs Monterey.</p>
<p>Object Capture and all the APIs we&rsquo;ve talked about today</p>
<p>are built on the Swift programming language.</p>
<p>Swift has made a huge impact on our app ecosystem,</p>
<p>and today, the majority of the top 1,000 apps</p>
<p>are built using Swift.</p>
<p>To tell you about the improvements</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re making this year, here&rsquo;s Ted.</p>
<p>[Ted] Thanks, Susan.</p>
<p>We designed Swift to make it easy to create great apps.</p>
<p>It has an approachable modern syntax,</p>
<p>incredible runtime performance,</p>
<p>and safety features that eliminate</p>
<p>whole categories of programming errors.</p>
<p>In recent years, we&rsquo;ve worked</p>
<p>with the Swift open-source community</p>
<p>to build tons of new features</p>
<p>that make Swift easier and more powerful.</p>
<p>And this year, one of the biggest features</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re building into Swift is Concurrency.</p>
<p>Concurrency is one of the most requested features for Swift,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s key to building apps</p>
<p>that are responsive to user input</p>
<p>while doing work in the background.</p>
<p>Concurrency also makes it dramatically easier</p>
<p>to write code that does work in parallel,</p>
<p>so your app can take full advantage</p>
<p>of multi-core processors.</p>
<p>Without language features that simplify concurrency,</p>
<p>you need to write &ldquo;asynchronous&rdquo; code</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s hard to write, hard to understand,</p>
<p>and hard to debug.</p>
<p>Our approach to concurrency in Swift</p>
<p>builds on the same core principles of Swift itself,</p>
<p>making it easier to write fast, modern,</p>
<p>safe code with fewer mistakes.</p>
<p>We built structured concurrency deep into the Swift language</p>
<p>and use the common async/await pattern</p>
<p>combined with a technology called actors.</p>
<p>This means you can write code as a simple sequence of steps</p>
<p>with actors safely isolating parallel tasks from one another.</p>
<p>So building code for concurrency</p>
<p>goes from something complicated like this</p>
<p>to something simple like this.</p>
<p>That kind of power and simplicity</p>
<p>is what Swift is all about,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re excited to share more with you this week.</p>
<p>Now, back to Susan.</p>
<p>[Susan] We created Swift and all these other</p>
<p>technologies and frameworks for one reason:</p>
<p>to help you build the best possible apps.</p>
<p>And the best place to discover those apps</p>
<p>is on the App Store.</p>
<p>To tell you about some of the exciting features</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve been working on, here&rsquo;s Ann.</p>
<p>[Ann] Since the beginning, we designed the App Store</p>
<p>to be a safe and trusted place.</p>
<p>Users can just focus on finding the right app,</p>
<p>knowing Apple has reviewed every app</p>
<p>to make sure it meets our high standards</p>
<p>for security, privacy, and safety.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why the App Store now serves</p>
<p>nearly 600 million weekly visitors</p>
<p>in 175 countries and regions,</p>
<p>making it a great business opportunity</p>
<p>for all developers,</p>
<p>and an engine for innovation and growth.</p>
<p>And Apple has now paid over $230 billion to developers</p>
<p>since the App Store launched.</p>
<p>Today, we&rsquo;re introducing some incredible new ways</p>
<p>to help developers like you reach even more users,</p>
<p>starting with the App Product Page.</p>
<p>This year, you&rsquo;ll be able to create</p>
<p>multiple custom product pages</p>
<p>to showcase different features of your app for different users.</p>
<p>You can also try out different screenshots,</p>
<p>videos, and even app icons</p>
<p>to understand what users like most.</p>
<p>These improvements will give you even more ways</p>
<p>to tell the world about your app.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also important to showcase the dynamic things happening</p>
<p>inside your apps.</p>
<p>The most popular apps and games</p>
<p>are constantly introducing new content</p>
<p>and limited-time events</p>
<p>like Pok√©mon Go Fest,</p>
<p>film premieres like In the Heights</p>
<p>and Nike fitness challenges.</p>
<p>Events across the entire app ecosystem</p>
<p>help users find the next big thing.</p>
<p>This year, we&rsquo;re introducing new ways</p>
<p>to discover amazing events like these.</p>
<p>We call them In-App Events.</p>
<p>With In-App Events, the dynamic content</p>
<p>and experiences within apps</p>
<p>will be front and center on the App Store</p>
<p>so users never miss a big moment.</p>
<p>And this is huge for developers.</p>
<p>In-App Events can be surfaced throughout the store</p>
<p>to millions of users, whether they&rsquo;re brand-new to the app</p>
<p>or they use it every day.</p>
<p>You can showcase them on your app&rsquo;s product page.</p>
<p>Users can learn more, sign up to be notified,</p>
<p>or quickly join the action if it&rsquo;s happening now.</p>
<p>They can discover events</p>
<p>with personalized recommendations.</p>
<p>And in Search.</p>
<p>Our expert editors will curate the best and biggest events.</p>
<p>And the new App Store widget</p>
<p>will feature upcoming events right on the home screen.</p>
<p>With In-App Events, the App Store continues to be</p>
<p>the best place to discover what&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>in apps and games.</p>
<p>And this will be open to all developers,</p>
<p>whether they already have events,</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;re just getting started.</p>
<p>And now I&rsquo;ll hand it back to Susan.</p>
<p>[Susan] There&rsquo;s something else we&rsquo;re doing this year,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s going to take app development</p>
<p>to the next level.</p>
<p>It integrates the Cloud with our developer tools</p>
<p>in a powerful new way, and it&rsquo;s called&hellip;</p>
<p>Xcode Cloud.</p>
<p>Today, creating an app requires multiple steps&ndash;</p>
<p>building, testing, and delivery&ndash;</p>
<p>and a number of different tools.</p>
<p>Xcode Cloud simplifies the workflow</p>
<p>by bringing everything together,</p>
<p>so as an individual developer,</p>
<p>you can focus your energy on being creative</p>
<p>and development teams can collaborate more effectively.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how it works.</p>
<p>When you commit a change to your code,</p>
<p>Xcode Cloud can automatically build the app.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s built in the Cloud,</p>
<p>your Mac is free for other tasks.</p>
<p>And for teams, everyone can see</p>
<p>if the change introduces errors,</p>
<p>so everyone can find and fix issues faster.</p>
<p>Then Xcode Cloud runs your automated tests in parallel</p>
<p>so they complete in a fraction of the time</p>
<p>even as they simulate running</p>
<p>on every kind of Apple device and platform.</p>
<p>And the test results are displayed in Xcode,</p>
<p>so you can easily see what worked</p>
<p>and fix what didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Finally, once the app passes all its tests,</p>
<p>Xcode Cloud can automatically distribute it</p>
<p>to the testers on your team,</p>
<p>and even external beta testers, with TestFlight.</p>
<p>And all of these essential continuous integration</p>
<p>and delivery features are right there in Xcode.</p>
<p>So you can work without switching tools</p>
<p>and you can stay focused on your code.</p>
<p>Xcode Cloud is the quickest, easiest way</p>
<p>to build, test, and deliver your apps.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s built with advanced security</p>
<p>to protect you and your projects.</p>
<p>Your source code is only used in a temporary build environment,</p>
<p>and the only things Xcode Cloud stores</p>
<p>are the products of the build.</p>
<p>Xcode Cloud and TestFlight</p>
<p>make it easy to distribute betas to users</p>
<p>on iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, and Apple TV,</p>
<p>and we want Xcode Cloud to be able</p>
<p>to automatically distribute beta apps</p>
<p>across all Apple platforms.</p>
<p>To make that happen,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re bringing TestFlight to the Mac.</p>
<p>So you can use TestFlight to easily test your Mac apps,</p>
<p>including features like In-app purchases.</p>
<p>Xcode Cloud is incredibly powerful,</p>
<p>and we can&rsquo;t wait for you to use it</p>
<p>and see how it&rsquo;ll help you build better apps faster.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll be providing access to a limited beta starting today</p>
<p>and expanding access to this free beta</p>
<p>throughout the summer and fall.</p>
<p>And Xcode Cloud will be available</p>
<p>to all developers next year.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll provide more details on pricing and availability</p>
<p>this fall.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re really excited about these announcements,</p>
<p>and these are just some of the highlights.</p>
<p>We continue to innovate with the App Store</p>
<p>and tools and technologies to help you</p>
<p>do extraordinary things.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re gonna be telling you even more</p>
<p>in sessions throughout the week.</p>
<p>Now, back to Tim.</p>
<p>But first&hellip; [snaps]</p>
<p>Much better.</p>
<p>Take it home, Tim.</p>
<p>[Tim] Thank you, Susan. And thank you, Craig.</p>
<p>And thanks to all of our presenters.</p>
<p>What a big day of announcements and innovations</p>
<p>for our users and our developers.</p>
<p>We took giant steps forward</p>
<p>with all of our software platforms,</p>
<p>and they will enable our users and developers</p>
<p>to do remarkable things.</p>
<p>Our OS releases will be available</p>
<p>as developer betas today.</p>
<p>And each of them will have a public beta next month.</p>
<p>And all of this incredible software</p>
<p>will be available to all of our users this fall.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so excited for these new releases</p>
<p>and how they will make our products even more powerful</p>
<p>and more capable.</p>
<p>They will provide users new ways to enrich their lives</p>
<p>and developers new tools to change the world.</p>
<p>We hope you&rsquo;ve enjoyed today&rsquo;s event</p>
<p>and that you&rsquo;re excited for the week ahead.</p>
<p>For those developers who want to take a deeper dive</p>
<p>into our announcements,</p>
<p>we have the Platforms State of the Union</p>
<p>coming up later today.</p>
<p>And we have a week full of in-depth sessions</p>
<p>and one-to-one labs with Apple engineers.</p>
<p>We will also provide Pavilions, Daily Recaps,</p>
<p>and other experiences</p>
<p>to help you get the most out of the conference.</p>
<p>Thank you for joining us. Let&rsquo;s have a great week!</p>
