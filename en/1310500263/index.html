    <p>The following is a conversation with Thomas Tall,</p>
<p>founder of Legendary Entertainment,</p>
<p>known for producing blockbusters</p>
<p>like Batman&rsquo;s Dark Knight Trilogy,</p>
<p>The Hangover franchise, Godzilla, Inception,</p>
<p>Jurassic World, 300, and many more.</p>
<p>He runs Tolko, which is an investment company</p>
<p>that focuses on how artificial intelligence</p>
<p>can revolutionize large industries.</p>
<p>He is part owner of the Pittsburgh Steelers.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the guitarist for the band Ghost Hounds</p>
<p>that tours with the Rolling Stones.</p>
<p>But most importantly, he&rsquo;s humble, down to earth,</p>
<p>and someone who has quickly become a mentor and friend.</p>
<p>This is the Lex Friedman podcast.</p>
<p>To support it, please check out our sponsors</p>
<p>in the description.</p>
<p>And now, here&rsquo;s my conversation with Thomas Tall.</p>
<p>In 2004, you founded Legendary Entertainment,</p>
<p>known for producing blockbusters</p>
<p>like Batman&rsquo;s Dark Knight Trilogy,</p>
<p>that includes Batman Begins, Dark Knight,</p>
<p>and Dark Knight Rises, The Hangover franchise,</p>
<p>Godzilla, Inception, Jurassic World, 300,</p>
<p>and the list goes on.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just some of the biggest movies in history.</p>
<p>What does it take to make an epic movie like that?</p>
<p>Or what does it take to make it happen</p>
<p>from start to finish?</p>
<p>Well, look, I&rsquo;ve been enamored with movies</p>
<p>since I was a kid as a fan,</p>
<p>and I think what you need is to be able</p>
<p>to tell a great story.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re gonna tell a great story,</p>
<p>you need a great director.</p>
<p>You gotta start with a fantastic script</p>
<p>that is able to take some of these iconic characters</p>
<p>that we did and put your own stamp on it</p>
<p>while still respecting the mythology.</p>
<p>And I had zero experience in movies and television</p>
<p>before I started Legendary,</p>
<p>so it was a very interesting trip.</p>
<p>Total luck that we had the opportunity</p>
<p>to make five movies at the time with Chris Nolan,</p>
<p>who turned out to be one of the greatest filmmakers</p>
<p>of all time.</p>
<p>But each one is its own little startup company,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s any formula to get there,</p>
<p>but I know that if you don&rsquo;t have a great director</p>
<p>and a great script, if you don&rsquo;t have that foundation,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard to pull off.</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s the CEO of that little startup company?</p>
<p>Is it the director?</p>
<p>Who would you say defines the success</p>
<p>or the failure of a movie?</p>
<p>Well, when you build a big movie like that,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an enormous effort, 360 degrees.</p>
<p>I mean, from digital effects, certainly the actors.</p>
<p>I mean, if you have an amazing script and amazing director,</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t believe anybody playing the parts,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a problem.</p>
<p>So the reason I think it was so difficult to pull off</p>
<p>is I always used to say you start with a stack of papers</p>
<p>with words on it called the script, bring that to life,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re asking an audience to believe in everything</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re trying to put out there,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve got a cast that,</p>
<p>even if they&rsquo;re immensely talented individually,</p>
<p>they have to mesh together,</p>
<p>they have to have chemistry together.</p>
<p>And the director is kind of a general on the battlefield,</p>
<p>but if you have a strong producer who&rsquo;s very hands on,</p>
<p>but it truly, to me, is each one had its own story</p>
<p>and its own sort of how it came to be</p>
<p>and why it worked or didn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>See, you said you were new to the industry,</p>
<p>but you did a lot of revolutionary things with Legendary.</p>
<p>So at that time and now, what is the good, the bad,</p>
<p>and the ugly of the business of filmmaking?</p>
<p>What are some interesting holes that you were able to,</p>
<p>or like problems that you were able to fix?</p>
<p>What problems still exist that can still be solved?</p>
<p>Well, look, the business has changed so radically</p>
<p>since 2004.</p>
<p>When I started Legendary, DVDs were still a cash cow.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s how far things have come.</p>
<p>But I would say a couple of things.</p>
<p>The reason that I started it from a business perspective</p>
<p>was at the time it was a $30 billion industry,</p>
<p>and there was no institutional capital</p>
<p>around the movie business.</p>
<p>And I was fascinated by that</p>
<p>because almost every other category that you look at</p>
<p>of that size has institutional capital,</p>
<p>private equity, et cetera,</p>
<p>is kind of a cottage industry set up around it.</p>
<p>And I was perplexed and fascinated that that didn&rsquo;t occur.</p>
<p>And the way the movie business worked</p>
<p>was unlike any business I&rsquo;d ever looked at before.</p>
<p>So after kind of convincing myself</p>
<p>that you could actually make money</p>
<p>if you were disciplined and had the right approach,</p>
<p>you know, went out,</p>
<p>raised the money from the capital markets,</p>
<p>markets which was Herculean,</p>
<p>still maybe the hardest thing I&rsquo;ve ever done in my career,</p>
<p>to walk around and say, look, I have no experience.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never done this before, but, you know.</p>
<p>And the second thing, being very fortunate at the time,</p>
<p>was able to partner up with Warner Brothers.</p>
<p>Warner&rsquo;s at the time was run by a man named Alan Horn,</p>
<p>who besides being creative is also a Harvard MBA.</p>
<p>So really understood what I wanted to do.</p>
<p>And Alan, you know, was just an absolute gentleman,</p>
<p>someone that I still look up to to this day.</p>
<p>After Warner Brothers, he went and ran Disney</p>
<p>with their run, you know,</p>
<p>between Marvel and Star Wars and everything.</p>
<p>And so between Alan being responsible for Harry Potter,</p>
<p>the Dark Knight stuff, and then onto all the Disney stuff,</p>
<p>he probably had as great a career</p>
<p>as anyone I&rsquo;ve ever heard of in the movie business.</p>
<p>So my first focus was around sort of two concepts,</p>
<p>global, worldwide, large tentpole films and franchises,</p>
<p>and then the business aspect of being,</p>
<p>bringing longterm institutional capital to bear.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna ask you dumb questions,</p>
<p>which is part of the style, I guess.</p>
<p>But just for people who don&rsquo;t know, including me,</p>
<p>what is institutional, what is capital?</p>
<p>What is institutional capital?</p>
<p>What is equity, what is private equity?</p>
<p>Got it, okay.</p>
<p>Well, so if you&rsquo;re starting a company</p>
<p>and you go around to a bunch of your successful friends</p>
<p>and say, hey, you should invest in my company.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s sort of, that&rsquo;s great and it&rsquo;s capital,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not getting money from Fidelity or TRO</p>
<p>or a sovereign wealth fund or an endowment fund</p>
<p>from a university that has large pools of organized capital</p>
<p>that has a longterm point of view on your business.</p>
<p>So if you get money from your neighbor</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s a successful dentist,</p>
<p>next year the dentist may say,</p>
<p>hey, times are hard, I need my money back.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re partners with Fidelity or Morgan Stanley</p>
<p>or any of these institutions,</p>
<p>they have the capital and the wherewithal to say,</p>
<p>okay, I&rsquo;m looking at this over the next five to 10 years.</p>
<p>And I thought there was an opportunity</p>
<p>to bring that type of capital to the movie business</p>
<p>to be patient.</p>
<p>And the benefit of that patient, so it&rsquo;s longterm,</p>
<p>you have to deal with fewer parties</p>
<p>and they would do much larger investments.</p>
<p>So what are the benefits?</p>
<p>What are the sort of the challenges</p>
<p>of that kind of investment?</p>
<p>Well, I think the benefits in some ways</p>
<p>are they&rsquo;re professionals who are largely dispassionate.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, look, if you&rsquo;re hitting the numbers you told me</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re hitting your plan, great.</p>
<p>And the other thing that always was interesting to me</p>
<p>about the movie business is if I&rsquo;m investing</p>
<p>in an artificial intelligence company</p>
<p>or a chipset company or something like that,</p>
<p>a lot of the institutions don&rsquo;t have the technical expertise</p>
<p>to really truly grasp what&rsquo;s being done.</p>
<p>So they don&rsquo;t, other than good business practices,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not offering every little opinion.</p>
<p>The movies and television are completely approachable,</p>
<p>meaning everybody has an opinion.</p>
<p>So whether it&rsquo;s, I think you guys chose the wrong actor</p>
<p>for that or why did you do that movie?</p>
<p>So it invites a lot more sort of second guessing</p>
<p>and things like that.</p>
<p>So that was always one of the idiosyncrasies</p>
<p>of the business that I thought was interesting.</p>
<p>And then when you talk about private equity</p>
<p>versus public equity, if you&rsquo;re a public company</p>
<p>where the companies are traded,</p>
<p>you wanna buy Microsoft shares, you just go to your broker,</p>
<p>go on TD Ameritrade and buy them.</p>
<p>If on the other hand, you&rsquo;re talking about private equity,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s institutions or individuals</p>
<p>investing in private companies.</p>
<p>So thus, if you have pools of capital</p>
<p>that mostly invest in private equity deals,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s how you&rsquo;d think about it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s difficult to make those happen</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s individuals, you have to sort of,</p>
<p>what, have dinners and agree.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s much less, it&rsquo;s much more human,</p>
<p>much less mechanical, I would say.</p>
<p>Yeah, now, and again, massive difference</p>
<p>between large private equity shops who are professionalized</p>
<p>and in the same category that I mentioned earlier</p>
<p>versus private individuals who are wealthy or whatever.</p>
<p>But again, it&rsquo;s much more individualized</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re going to people who like your idea</p>
<p>and just say, I&rsquo;d like to invest in this.</p>
<p>Is that, from all the kinds of investments you&rsquo;ve seen,</p>
<p>what do you think is the most conducive</p>
<p>to creating works of genius,</p>
<p>whether that&rsquo;s in technology, AI space,</p>
<p>or whether that&rsquo;s in movies?</p>
<p>So creating something special in this world.</p>
<p>I would say a couple of things.</p>
<p>Enough money that whatever endeavor you&rsquo;re going into,</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re not so nervous about the edges, right?</p>
<p>If I have $100 to spend and I think I can create</p>
<p>a perpetual motion machine or something for $104,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t do it because they&rsquo;re all over me about the budget.</p>
<p>So I would say making sure that you have enough capital,</p>
<p>making sure that that capital is patient enough</p>
<p>so that it&rsquo;s, if you&rsquo;re gonna do things</p>
<p>that are extraordinary, it takes some time.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re gonna break stuff, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna make mistakes,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna have a whole bunch of film</p>
<p>on the cutting room floor, so to speak,</p>
<p>or if you&rsquo;re in the lab,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna have a whole bunch of broken stuff.</p>
<p>And I also think it&rsquo;s very important at the beginning,</p>
<p>and I always try to do this with companies I invest in</p>
<p>or buy, is make sure that you have a philosophical</p>
<p>and somewhat mechanical alignment with the management team.</p>
<p>So that going in, you both understand,</p>
<p>hey, this is how we think about this problem</p>
<p>or this company, this is what we feel like our culture is,</p>
<p>this is what our goal is, and these are the metrics</p>
<p>by which we&rsquo;ll agree to measure them by.</p>
<p>Because if you don&rsquo;t have that shared,</p>
<p>you know, hey, we&rsquo;re gonna take this journey,</p>
<p>then I think that&rsquo;s where people get upset,</p>
<p>disappointed, et cetera.</p>
<p>What about, this is a weird question, but constraints.</p>
<p>So this is both for filmmaking and investment.</p>
<p>Do you think more money is always better?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>So I like constraints a lot.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like constraints and almost like a desperation,</p>
<p>and deadlines are catalysts for creativity,</p>
<p>for productivity, for sort of innovation.</p>
<p>So can you kind of speak to that as an investor,</p>
<p>as a creator, like what&rsquo;s the right balance here?</p>
<p>Well, I think if you&rsquo;re focused on a particular problem</p>
<p>or a company or a thesis, if you have that focus</p>
<p>and you feel like I have unlimited resources</p>
<p>or renewable resources, so there&rsquo;s really,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no leverage in the situation, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no, if I fail at this,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just go get more money, right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just go, I think that&rsquo;s a hard way to be resilient</p>
<p>and to think of new ways to solve problems.</p>
<p>So I think capitalizing things just, you know,</p>
<p>to the nth degree does create some problems.</p>
<p>So I think there&rsquo;s that perfect blend of</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t starve the oxygen to the point</p>
<p>where you make short term decisions</p>
<p>or non strategic or thoughtful decisions</p>
<p>because you gotta pay the rent.</p>
<p>And on the other hand, you can&rsquo;t have it be like this,</p>
<p>you know, everlasting gobstopper of whatever you want</p>
<p>will just keep flowing the cash</p>
<p>because that doesn&rsquo;t create any friction points</p>
<p>that I think do result in works of genius,</p>
<p>works of genius in things that, you know,</p>
<p>that are transformative.</p>
<p>And one of the things that is interesting to me</p>
<p>about society sort of writ large is</p>
<p>I think that when you go through hard times</p>
<p>and you have to do things that are uncomfortable</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t wanna do them because you&rsquo;re tired,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re, that in some ways builds up that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re comfortable being uncomfortable muscle.</p>
<p>And I sometimes think we&rsquo;re losing that a little bit</p>
<p>and you can&rsquo;t sort of paint with a wide brush,</p>
<p>but you know, that&rsquo;s one of the things</p>
<p>that I kind of observe and hope that we don&rsquo;t go that way.</p>
<p>I do think challenge and discomfort are a kind of gift</p>
<p>because like overcoming that,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like from every perspective,</p>
<p>from a human perspective, it&rsquo;s a source of happiness</p>
<p>and fulfillment, overcoming challenge.</p>
<p>But from a business perspective,</p>
<p>I see like if something is really difficult,</p>
<p>to me it&rsquo;s also a sign that most others would,</p>
<p>or many others would fail at this point.</p>
<p>So like it&rsquo;s a feature.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s nice that something is difficult.</p>
<p>When people tell you that something is impossible,</p>
<p>I love that because it&rsquo;s like, all right,</p>
<p>well then that&rsquo;s what a lot of people would believe.</p>
<p>And that gives you an opportunity to be the person</p>
<p>who shows it&rsquo;s not impossible.</p>
<p>And you, of course you might be wrong,</p>
<p>but if you&rsquo;re not wrong,</p>
<p>you have the opportunity to stand out.</p>
<p>So going through that hardship, taking those big risks,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to really pay off.</p>
<p>So like discomfort is a feature, not a bug</p>
<p>of both personal life, it&rsquo;s just good for life,</p>
<p>but for business, it seems like just good business sense.</p>
<p>If something is hard, it&rsquo;s probably a good idea to do that.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Because most others will fail.</p>
<p>Fun question.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you can answer this,</p>
<p>but what&rsquo;s the most expensive movie</p>
<p>you were involved with to make?</p>
<p>And why was it, you don&rsquo;t have to say numbers,</p>
<p>but like is something stand out</p>
<p>as being exceptionally expensive and why is it expensive?</p>
<p>Um, I think Jurassic World was pretty expensive.</p>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p>I mean, worked out great.</p>
<p>And, uh.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an epic film, by the way.</p>
<p>It, look, it&rsquo;s one of my favorites.</p>
<p>They just did an amazing job.</p>
<p>And frankly, the crazy thing about my life</p>
<p>is all the stuff that I loved as a kid</p>
<p>somehow came full circle back into my adult life.</p>
<p>And having the opportunity while I was out there</p>
<p>to develop a friendship with Steven Spielberg</p>
<p>and then have my name on the same film as Steven Spielberg.</p>
<p>I mean, that was pretty surreal.</p>
<p>So that was an expensive film.</p>
<p>You know, Dark Knight Rises was an expensive film.</p>
<p>But again, to me, there&rsquo;s a difference</p>
<p>between expensive and irresponsible,</p>
<p>and expensive because the vision warranted</p>
<p>and it turned out financially it certainly did.</p>
<p>Yeah, with Jurassic World, it&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>I mean, I can&rsquo;t even imagine having those meetings</p>
<p>because like you have to create so much</p>
<p>and so much of it is obviously not real.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t bring dinosaurs in a.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Is that where a lot of the cost is,</p>
<p>is in the computer side of things?</p>
<p>Yeah, those are generally pretty massive components</p>
<p>of the budget, and especially if you&rsquo;re doing it</p>
<p>and inventing things as you go.</p>
<p>I mean, Jim Cameron is one of those filmmakers</p>
<p>who is designing the plane as it&rsquo;s flying</p>
<p>in such a brilliant way.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve got to know him over the years</p>
<p>and just in awe of the way his brain works.</p>
<p>And so yeah, it&rsquo;s a big component.</p>
<p>Can you speak a little bit more to him</p>
<p>in terms of, because you&rsquo;re such a fascinating person</p>
<p>because you care a lot about technology.</p>
<p>You care a lot about the cutting edge of technology.</p>
<p>So how does he, a creator, a director,</p>
<p>build the plane while it&rsquo;s flying?</p>
<p>Like what&rsquo;s the role of innovation in this whole process?</p>
<p>Well, so I never made a film with Jim.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just a huge fan and got to know him</p>
<p>and John Landau, his producing partner.</p>
<p>And one of the things that just fascinates me about Jim is,</p>
<p>so he makes Titanic and there&rsquo;s a bunch of underwater cameras</p>
<p>and things that they need that don&rsquo;t exist.</p>
<p>So he goes and invents them and has a good grasp</p>
<p>of engineering and has not only the imagination,</p>
<p>but the ability to lead a team to build them.</p>
<p>I got to go down early when they were shooting Avatar</p>
<p>at a warehouse, I think it was, where they were shooting.</p>
<p>And as they were explaining to me how they were capturing it</p>
<p>and that they could go back later</p>
<p>because they created the environment, it blew my mind.</p>
<p>And I said, okay, this is truly,</p>
<p>people talk about a big leap.</p>
<p>This certainly is one.</p>
<p>So he has continued to push the envelope</p>
<p>in terms of the art of the possible.</p>
<p>And I just think he&rsquo;s an incredible genius in that way.</p>
<p>Again, another hard question.</p>
<p>So you, in the realm of music, care about story, storytelling.</p>
<p>Is there some aspect in which money</p>
<p>and beautiful graphics get in the way of story?</p>
<p>In filmmaking, so if you think about Jurassic World,</p>
<p>obviously that&rsquo;s an experience like any other.</p>
<p>Like what do you think about the tension</p>
<p>between story, experience and like visual effects?</p>
<p>Well, look, if you&rsquo;re using big effect shots</p>
<p>and all kinds of tricks to cover over the fact</p>
<p>that you don&rsquo;t have a very interesting story to tell,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s where I think it gets in the way.</p>
<p>Where I think you have these incredible filmmakers,</p>
<p>we mentioned Chris Nolan and Jim Cameron,</p>
<p>Guillermo del Toro, you could go on and on,</p>
<p>folks that just see the world differently</p>
<p>and use technology to enhance the storytelling, right?</p>
<p>To make you believe differently,</p>
<p>rather to make you not just suspend your disbelief,</p>
<p>but to feel like you&rsquo;re immersed in it.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve certainly seen it done expertly</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve seen it done poorly.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve talked about this a little bit in the past.</p>
<p>You kind of left the moviemaking business</p>
<p>at an interesting time, perhaps you saw the changes.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s been a lot of excitement with Netflix, with TV,</p>
<p>so the role of film in society has changed.</p>
<p>So what do you think is the future of movies versus TV?</p>
<p>Like if you were as a business person, as a creator,</p>
<p>as a consumer, as a technologist,</p>
<p>are thinking about the next 10, 20 years,</p>
<p>what do you think is going to be the godfather,</p>
<p>the great pieces that move us as a society</p>
<p>in the next 10, 20 years?</p>
<p>Is it going to be TV?</p>
<p>Is it going to be movie?</p>
<p>Is it going to be a TikTok clips?</p>
<p>What is it?</p>
<p>Well, so, and I think the other category</p>
<p>that I would add to that, that will be the next great medium</p>
<p>is truly immersive virtual reality</p>
<p>in which new storytellers will emerge,</p>
<p>especially when you can go into VR</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s enough computing power to sustain it</p>
<p>and to allow it to be social</p>
<p>and for you to have different paths to go down.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;ll be, I think, the next realm</p>
<p>of what storytelling and experience will look like.</p>
<p>Do you think a video game kind of world</p>
<p>or is it more movies or is it more social network</p>
<p>or is it all of it kind of blending reality and gaming</p>
<p>and movies?</p>
<p>Yeah, I thought if you saw Ready Player One,</p>
<p>which I love the book and the movie was cool too,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s one version of it, right?</p>
<p>Where you go in, now everybody&rsquo;s talking about the metaverse</p>
<p>and all that, but you go into a world</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s fully rendered as yourself</p>
<p>and you interact with that world.</p>
<p>The other side of it is to go in somewhere</p>
<p>between being a passive observer,</p>
<p>but being able to move around your point of view</p>
<p>and experiences, which I think is interesting.</p>
<p>And then I think another adventure, so to speak,</p>
<p>I could think of is a blend of video games.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a mission, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s obstacles, there&rsquo;s everything</p>
<p>and you move through it, but it&rsquo;s immersive</p>
<p>and it tells a story at the same time.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why I think you&rsquo;re gonna see</p>
<p>new amazing storytellers that we don&rsquo;t know yet</p>
<p>that understand how to innovate</p>
<p>and how to make you feel something in that environment.</p>
<p>And to your earlier point, I saw probably around 2015</p>
<p>when Netflix decided to be bold, put out House of Cards,</p>
<p>put out all the episodes, leave you in charge</p>
<p>of the pace at which you would view them,</p>
<p>which I thought was great.</p>
<p>That was a gutsy move.</p>
<p>Yes, it was.</p>
<p>And I can&rsquo;t tell you around Hollywood,</p>
<p>anybody that says that everybody thought it was a great idea</p>
<p>is not being truthful because everybody I talked to</p>
<p>said this is, they&rsquo;re idiots, right?</p>
<p>What do they know about movie making and TV?</p>
<p>And what I saw happening was if you look</p>
<p>at what Netflix pulled off and they realized</p>
<p>that there isn&rsquo;t really a moat around the studios,</p>
<p>you really could make stuff and really good stuff.</p>
<p>And so they started to create their own content</p>
<p>that pulled in Amazon, which pulled in Google</p>
<p>through YouTube and then you had Hulu,</p>
<p>then you had Disney deciding</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re gonna have Disney Plus.</p>
<p>And the next thing you know, you have some</p>
<p>of the biggest companies with the largest balance sheets</p>
<p>on the planet being in the creative business.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re an independent, that&rsquo;s bringing a knife</p>
<p>to a gunfight to be sure.</p>
<p>And so I thought that was interesting.</p>
<p>The other thing that it used to be that movies</p>
<p>were where the big things happened</p>
<p>and television was sort of,</p>
<p>it was small screen, different experience.</p>
<p>And you had something like Game of Thrones come out,</p>
<p>which was not only on the same epic level visually</p>
<p>and storytelling wise, but had the budget</p>
<p>to be able to do it.</p>
<p>And now I think you&rsquo;re seeing all kinds</p>
<p>of different storytelling taking place.</p>
<p>And I also like that you&rsquo;re not pigeonholed into a time.</p>
<p>You got two hours to tell the story.</p>
<p>You can do a three part mini series,</p>
<p>a five part mini series.</p>
<p>You can do television that&rsquo;s all kinds of different format.</p>
<p>That I think allows creators</p>
<p>to do a lot more interesting things.</p>
<p>It is also interesting to consider the role</p>
<p>of companies that enable that,</p>
<p>like the capital that enables that.</p>
<p>Without Netflix and HBO, you wouldn&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>some of these epic shows.</p>
<p>And so if we&rsquo;re thinking about the virtual reality world</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re talking about,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s interesting to consider who will enable that.</p>
<p>Now, like you said, Facebook is talking about meta</p>
<p>and metaverse, but it&rsquo;s unclear</p>
<p>that just having money is enough.</p>
<p>Netflix did a lot of really revolutionary stuff.</p>
<p>Amazon has money.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of companies that have money</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t quite do as good of a job yet</p>
<p>at enabling creators of creating revolutionary new content.</p>
<p>That changes the whole industry.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s probably going to be the case</p>
<p>with virtual reality.</p>
<p>There is a lot of money needed to enable experiences,</p>
<p>like in terms of compute infrastructure.</p>
<p>There needs to be a huge amount of money there,</p>
<p>but you also need to somehow give freedom to creators</p>
<p>to have fun, to do their best work,</p>
<p>and at the same time provide the perfect amount</p>
<p>of constraints, all of that together.</p>
<p>However Netflix makes it happen,</p>
<p>they do a pretty good job</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a very constrained platform,</p>
<p>but yet all the creators I&rsquo;ve ever talked to,</p>
<p>comedians and so on, that work with Netflix,</p>
<p>are really happy because they feel free</p>
<p>to create their work.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I think a lot of times companies are a letterhead,</p>
<p>but it boils down to the people.</p>
<p>And I think I&rsquo;ve known Ted Sarandos a long time</p>
<p>who ran the studio at Netflix</p>
<p>and now took over for Reed running the company.</p>
<p>But Ted, very smart, talented guy,</p>
<p>and understood early how to cultivate talent</p>
<p>and relationships with talent, which is important.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re dealing with creative people,</p>
<p>their motivations and their goals</p>
<p>are not always the same, right?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not always capitalistic, right?</p>
<p>And so in terms of being able to communicate</p>
<p>with creative people that are not always A to B to C</p>
<p>is a talent.</p>
<p>And so I think they did a great job.</p>
<p>Ted did a great job with that early.</p>
<p>But I think that you&rsquo;re gonna see different formats.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think, I mean, going to a theater</p>
<p>to see a massive movie on that screen in that format</p>
<p>is a fundamentally different experience.</p>
<p>And I think you&rsquo;re gonna find movies,</p>
<p>my old shop, Legendary, just put out Dune,</p>
<p>which I thought was phenomenal.</p>
<p>When we secured the rights to Dune years ago,</p>
<p>I was over the moon because I love the book.</p>
<p>I love the entire world that is Dune.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a movie that I think you see on the big screen.</p>
<p>I think when Avatar 2 comes out,</p>
<p>I wanna see that on a big screen.</p>
<p>But I think you&rsquo;re gonna see a ton of content</p>
<p>is obviously being produced,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not all gonna go to a theater going experience.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re gonna see, I think, different versions of this</p>
<p>over the next five to 10 years.</p>
<p>In case James Cameron is listening to this,</p>
<p>so he officially agreed to talk at the time of,</p>
<p>on this podcast, at the time of Avatar 2 release.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just holding you to that in this recorded conversation.</p>
<p>Also just super excited, both the movie and the director.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something special about movies.</p>
<p>They win Oscars, they&rsquo;re historic in nature.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something about TV shows,</p>
<p>even when they&rsquo;re epic like Game of Thrones,</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re forgotten much quicker in history.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, maybe that&rsquo;s because we haven&rsquo;t had</p>
<p>enough of them, but the De Niro performances,</p>
<p>and the Scorsese films, all the great films</p>
<p>that we think of throughout the generations</p>
<p>that define generations are films.</p>
<p>Is that just old school thinking?</p>
<p>Is that always going to be the case?</p>
<p>I mean, look, to me, going in a darkened theater</p>
<p>with a bunch of strangers, and the lights go down,</p>
<p>and you go on this journey, there is something special</p>
<p>and magical about that.</p>
<p>And I think movies have been a part</p>
<p>of our cultural fabric forever.</p>
<p>And for some reason, Hollywood in America</p>
<p>was uniquely positioned to do a great job with it.</p>
<p>Not that there aren&rsquo;t great foreign movies,</p>
<p>but far and away, American movies dominate,</p>
<p>not only the world market, but you know,</p>
<p>and so whatever it is that we do well,</p>
<p>or Hollywood does well, there&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>in the water, apparently.</p>
<p>But I agree that I love movies,</p>
<p>and I will for the rest of my days.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting how creators can move</p>
<p>back and forth now as well.</p>
<p>That used to be a complete no no.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re either a movie guy, or you&rsquo;re a person,</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re a TV director, and that&rsquo;s that.</p>
<p>But those lines have completely blurred.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re also blurring, I mean,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re blurring all kinds of lines.</p>
<p>Like they&rsquo;re moving to TikTok and Instagram,</p>
<p>and I know right now it seems ridiculous</p>
<p>to consider that these one minute things</p>
<p>could be considered even in the same realm creatively</p>
<p>as a film, but maybe that changes over time too.</p>
<p>Maybe experiences can completely become fluid</p>
<p>in terms of their size, as long as they have</p>
<p>some deep lasting impact on you as a human being,</p>
<p>as a consumer.</p>
<p>Look, to me, the whole thing is about</p>
<p>either the moving image, or even sometimes a picture</p>
<p>will bring out an emotion, a reaction, something.</p>
<p>So short form is harder, because you have less time</p>
<p>to set things up and all that.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m sure there will be short videos</p>
<p>and creators that come up with things,</p>
<p>and if a moving image can get a reaction out of you,</p>
<p>and make you feel a certain way,</p>
<p>and stay with you, or inspire you,</p>
<p>well, that to me is just the next evolution</p>
<p>of whatever it&rsquo;s gonna be between humans</p>
<p>and cameras, et cetera.</p>
<p>See, I think that&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;ve talked offline about this.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I love robots, is I think there&rsquo;s certain things</p>
<p>in the short form with robots that immediately</p>
<p>can bring out a feeling in people.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something about our consideration</p>
<p>of our own intelligence, of our own consciousness,</p>
<p>of all the fears and hopes, and the beautiful things</p>
<p>about human nature, the dark things about human nature</p>
<p>that somehow, especially Lego robots bring out.</p>
<p>Because we have both a fear and excitement towards that.</p>
<p>Are these going to be our overlords,</p>
<p>our gods that overtake humanity?</p>
<p>Are these going to be things like horses</p>
<p>or something like that, something that empower humanity?</p>
<p>Like you don&rsquo;t know what to make sense of it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re super exciting.</p>
<p>I agree.</p>
<p>Speaking of robots and film, you&rsquo;ve gone</p>
<p>into traditional industries and disrupted them</p>
<p>quite a few times.</p>
<p>Was there, is there a system for deciding</p>
<p>which industry is right for disruption?</p>
<p>When you look at the world and see</p>
<p>what are the big problems you would like to solve,</p>
<p>do you have a system of how you see which problems to solve?</p>
<p>How do you look at the world?</p>
<p>Yeah, well, on the business side of that,</p>
<p>so I have a holding company called Tolko,</p>
<p>I know, very imaginatively named.</p>
<p>Part of that is literally every name ever is now taken,</p>
<p>registered and all that stuff.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re a holding company.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s a holding company?</p>
<p>So instead of being a fund that has money flowing</p>
<p>in and out of it, and there&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s called a vintage year,</p>
<p>I raise capital and I agree to invest that capital</p>
<p>for so long, and then I give it back to you,</p>
<p>which sometimes creates artificial time pressures</p>
<p>and things like that.</p>
<p>A holding company is more permanent capital.</p>
<p>So the idea was, behind Tolko,</p>
<p>was to buy almost always whole companies</p>
<p>or majority stakes with great management teams</p>
<p>in spaces that did not traditionally</p>
<p>have a lot of innovation.</p>
<p>And to have our labs group, who were data scientists,</p>
<p>AI practitioners, engineers, machine learning, et cetera,</p>
<p>and to be able to bring that wherewithal to that company.</p>
<p>So to provide them with the right capital</p>
<p>and to provide them with access to technology,</p>
<p>that would be hard to individually recruit for that company.</p>
<p>So I would say that the thesis was to look</p>
<p>for industries that were large enough,</p>
<p>that hadn&rsquo;t traditionally had access</p>
<p>to that type of technology or innovation,</p>
<p>and to try to look for companies that not only</p>
<p>looked that part, but had management teams</p>
<p>that embraced this and wanted to take that kind of journey.</p>
<p>Yeah, there is quite a few industries like that,</p>
<p>but that finding the industries and the management pair,</p>
<p>because those industries often have</p>
<p>a lot of old school folks who don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>it takes quite a bit of work for them</p>
<p>to leap into technology.</p>
<p>I work quite a bit with the autonomous vehicles</p>
<p>and just the automotive industry.</p>
<p>Depending on the company, there&rsquo;s old school folks.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like Detroit thinking versus like,</p>
<p>what do you call it, I don&rsquo;t know, California thinking.</p>
<p>Well, I think you have to look at the nexus</p>
<p>of two things there.</p>
<p>One is just plain old human behavior.</p>
<p>If I am uncomfortable and this isn&rsquo;t a comfort zone for me</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not something I have as a field of expertise,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna shy away from that.</p>
<p>Especially if I&rsquo;m successful and I feel good about myself</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a big successful company or person</p>
<p>or whatever it might be.</p>
<p>And the second thing is that especially</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re a public company and you&rsquo;re being weighed</p>
<p>and measured every quarter, you are rewarding</p>
<p>the managers of that company to hit metrics</p>
<p>and to be reliable and to say, hey,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m counting quarter to quarter</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re gonna deliver what you say.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s difficult to say, you know what, everybody,</p>
<p>for the next two years, I wouldn&rsquo;t count</p>
<p>on our financial projections at all</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re gonna reinvent what we&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna work in the long run and you&rsquo;re gonna see</p>
<p>that this was a really smart investment</p>
<p>five to seven years from now.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not the way capitalism is currently wired,</p>
<p>generally, right?</p>
<p>And a lot of, so again, if you reward managers</p>
<p>with yearly bonuses and stock options</p>
<p>based and tied to stock price and all these other things,</p>
<p>you know, and then ask them to go break stuff,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s hard, I think.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re saying like, so the talker approach</p>
<p>to this, the private investment is the best way</p>
<p>or perhaps the only way to enable this kind</p>
<p>of long term innovation, investment,</p>
<p>taking big risks, investing in innovation.</p>
<p>Well, look, we certainly are not, by any means,</p>
<p>the only one doing it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just saying that when you think about big companies,</p>
<p>more successful, you know, that are in old line businesses,</p>
<p>and I hear people sort of talk about,</p>
<p>well, why can&rsquo;t they just pivot?</p>
<p>They recognize they need to be in the technology business</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s hard, it&rsquo;s hard to steer a ship and turn it</p>
<p>that big, and especially if it&rsquo;s not part</p>
<p>of your DNA at that company.</p>
<p>So, you know, I just think that what we tried to do</p>
<p>is to enable management teams that know</p>
<p>where they wanna go and to be patient with capital</p>
<p>and also, again, bring innovation to bear</p>
<p>that they have access to.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s plenty of capital structures</p>
<p>doing interesting things.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one of the things I love about our country.</p>
<p>This country innovates and this country invents things,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m constantly in awe of just the, you know,</p>
<p>the human ability to innovate and to iterate.</p>
<p>You know, I get to hang around some universities,</p>
<p>including your old shop, MIT, and it&rsquo;s like.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still there.</p>
<p>Yeah, you&rsquo;re still there.</p>
<p>Still there, still teaching there.</p>
<p>Still teaching, but that place is like Hogwarts.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s inspiring, right?</p>
<p>And certainly the energy in Silicon Valley,</p>
<p>which now Austin, Texas, where we&rsquo;re sitting,</p>
<p>has its own incredible ecosystem.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s one of the things I love about America</p>
<p>is the ability, and that really is, I think,</p>
<p>in the American DNA, to create things and invent things,</p>
<p>and I just, I think that&rsquo;s invigorating.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s even bigger than capitalism,</p>
<p>sort of the machine of how capitalism works.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just human nature.</p>
<p>Capitalism is just one of the ways</p>
<p>to sort of make that human nature shine, I suppose,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s like, you mentioned MIT.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a drive there to invent, to innovate,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s so purely human, that human spirit</p>
<p>to sort of build something new.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like that hopeful, optimistic spirit,</p>
<p>especially in the engineering space.</p>
<p>Like if you pay attention to the internet,</p>
<p>like Twitter and all that kind of stuff,</p>
<p>intellectuals and so on, there&rsquo;s a cynicism</p>
<p>to when we talk about stuff,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s an optimism to when we do stuff.</p>
<p>And the doing part, when you actually build things,</p>
<p>especially, like you care a lot about manufacturing too,</p>
<p>like you actually build physical products,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s where we truly shine.</p>
<p>Yeah, no question about it.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m passionate about our country making stuff again,</p>
<p>doing our own manufacturing and making sure</p>
<p>that we don&rsquo;t lose the ability,</p>
<p>not just to create things intellectually</p>
<p>and do the world&rsquo;s greatest blueprints,</p>
<p>but actually make things here.</p>
<p>Actual factories.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s exactly right.</p>
<p>How do we do that?</p>
<p>How do we bring more manufacturing to the United States?</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s a company that I have a big personal investment</p>
<p>in called Rebuild with some folks</p>
<p>that all went through the MIT school years ago.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a good friend of mine named Jeff Wilkie</p>
<p>who used to be at Amazon.</p>
<p>And we all felt the same way that America needed</p>
<p>to make sure that it didn&rsquo;t lose its edge in that way.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a company that invests</p>
<p>in American high tech manufacturing.</p>
<p>And I think the way that we do that is provide capital,</p>
<p>provide training.</p>
<p>To me, this is also fertile ground for good,</p>
<p>sustainable, high paying jobs.</p>
<p>And we have to make it economically feasible to do that,</p>
<p>again, here in this country.</p>
<p>And not to say to companies that, again,</p>
<p>are being weighed and measured quarter by quarter.</p>
<p>Hey, this is three times as expensive to do it here,</p>
<p>but you should do it here.</p>
<p>We need to innovate and we need to create processes</p>
<p>and companies and opportunity that balance that equation.</p>
<p>And I think as we saw during the pandemic,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think in this day and age you can be an isolationist.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t make any sense to me.</p>
<p>But being self reliant and self determinant</p>
<p>and making sure that you are never in a position as a nation</p>
<p>that we can&rsquo;t do basic things</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re relying on supply chain in other countries.</p>
<p>And whether it&rsquo;s we&rsquo;re not friends anymore,</p>
<p>or a natural disaster or a virus or something pops up,</p>
<p>I think those are costs of doing business</p>
<p>that we have to put into the calculus</p>
<p>of being able to make things here.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an extremely high cost to making supply chain</p>
<p>resilient that we really have to consider.</p>
<p>And so if you really consider that cost,</p>
<p>it makes a lot of sense to invest especially long term</p>
<p>in building up manufacturing in a way</p>
<p>where like you&rsquo;re making most of the stuff in one place.</p>
<p>Sort of bringing it all, not all,</p>
<p>but as much in as possible.</p>
<p>And building it almost like from scratch</p>
<p>here in the United States.</p>
<p>I mean, what I guess your thought is with innovation,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s possible to sort of revolutionize</p>
<p>the way we do manufacturing.</p>
<p>So reduce the amount of supply chain stuff</p>
<p>and like build stuff from scratch.</p>
<p>Like do high tech manufacturing.</p>
<p>So like optimize all aspects of the manufacturing</p>
<p>and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I think where technology is the most efficient</p>
<p>is the human machine interface, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not let&rsquo;s automate everything</p>
<p>and have nobody work anywhere.</p>
<p>I, for a long time, that&rsquo;s neither feasible nor desirable.</p>
<p>But where we can enhance jobs</p>
<p>and make that interface immensely productive</p>
<p>with the right training and so forth,</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a worthwhile endeavor</p>
<p>and something that&rsquo;s gonna be important to our country.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, you know who you&rsquo;re talking to.</p>
<p>I love human robot interaction, human machine interaction,</p>
<p>human AI interaction.</p>
<p>So what do you think is the role of robotics</p>
<p>in this high tech manufacturing?</p>
<p>Sort of like industrial robots, robotic arms,</p>
<p>all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Or even more complicated kind of robots.</p>
<p>What do you think is the role of robotics?</p>
<p>What do you think is the role of AI</p>
<p>in this manufacturing future you&rsquo;re thinking about?</p>
<p>Well, robotics to me is an extremely exciting field.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have the same expertise that you do.</p>
<p>I have an adjacency, but not the depth of knowledge.</p>
<p>Have never really delved deeply into it</p>
<p>or made investments in it.</p>
<p>But I think what&rsquo;s exciting about it</p>
<p>is everything from doing jobs</p>
<p>that are very dangerous for humans,</p>
<p>enhancing the human experience.</p>
<p>When you look at really repetitive labor,</p>
<p>things that, you know, it might take away a job,</p>
<p>but is it a good job for that person?</p>
<p>Is, you know, spending 30 years</p>
<p>doing something highly repetitious,</p>
<p>is that a good experience in life?</p>
<p>So I think, and then when you think about everything</p>
<p>from military applications, you know, rescue,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re already seeing a bunch of those things.</p>
<p>And then just lastly,</p>
<p>when you talk about that human interaction with robots,</p>
<p>when you start to have the combination,</p>
<p>so you have some level of intelligence and interaction,</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s why we always love the droids</p>
<p>in Star Wars, right?</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s exciting, it captures the imagination.</p>
<p>And I think, look, many, many hours have been spent</p>
<p>on debating artificial intelligence</p>
<p>and the ramifications, if things go sideways and so forth.</p>
<p>And I think those are all, you know,</p>
<p>those are appropriate conversations to be having.</p>
<p>AI is happening.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s actually happening slower</p>
<p>than most people realize,</p>
<p>because there are tasks that humans do</p>
<p>every minute of every day,</p>
<p>standing up without losing your sense of balance.</p>
<p>I mean, these are really hard things,</p>
<p>but I think there&rsquo;s enough investment,</p>
<p>both in private industry as well as nation states now</p>
<p>on artificial intelligence that it is coming.</p>
<p>So both in the software space, in the digital space</p>
<p>and in the physical space.</p>
<p>So we talk about manufacturing,</p>
<p>so industrial robotics is very true</p>
<p>that even in the factory, even the tasks that you think</p>
<p>are pretty basic, you know,</p>
<p>the amount of small intuitive decisions that humans make</p>
<p>is quite incredible.</p>
<p>So we have to be kind of explicit about saying</p>
<p>which tasks are actually really hard</p>
<p>and humans are just really good at them.</p>
<p>And so on the flip side in the digital space</p>
<p>with social networks, we recommend our systems</p>
<p>with all kinds of like personal assistance</p>
<p>in terms of voice based AI systems, all of that.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s opportunities there to find niches</p>
<p>where AI can really have a transformative effect.</p>
<p>I think one of the places that really haven&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>this is where like you&rsquo;re worried to say stupid things,</p>
<p>but I believe this very much that when we have AI systems</p>
<p>in the home currently, you have somebody like Alexa</p>
<p>and Google Home and so on,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re kind of very basic servants.</p>
<p>They tell you about the weather, they can play some music,</p>
<p>they can turn the lights on and off,</p>
<p>all the kind of like smart home stuff.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a lot of value in systems</p>
<p>that form relationships with us</p>
<p>in the way that pets do, dogs and cats.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, just for people who have cats,</p>
<p>cats don&rsquo;t care about you.</p>
<p>They really don&rsquo;t, they don&rsquo;t form any kind of relationship.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why you have relationship with them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one way.</p>
<p>Anyway, sorry, I threw out some shade.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just kidding by the way.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a basic kind of connection you have</p>
<p>with another living being.</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s also just friends.</p>
<p>You have different levels of friends,</p>
<p>acquaintances, you have lifelong friends, all that.</p>
<p>That friendship you have, I really believe</p>
<p>that there is some aspect of the human experience</p>
<p>that is deeply enriched by interacting with other beings.</p>
<p>And for systems, computing systems,</p>
<p>artificial intelligence systems in our world,</p>
<p>to have the capability to engage in some of that,</p>
<p>I think is not just an opportunity</p>
<p>to help people grow, become better people,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also just a good business opportunity too.</p>
<p>And that hasn&rsquo;t really been explored enough.</p>
<p>So that to me is really, that&rsquo;s a whole exciting space</p>
<p>that I think will enable better industrial robotics.</p>
<p>It will empower a better Facebook</p>
<p>or a better social network, a competitor to Facebook</p>
<p>that overthrows Facebook.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;ll create better technologies</p>
<p>that currently don&rsquo;t have that human robot interaction touch.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know, that&rsquo;s super exciting to me,</p>
<p>but that has to deal with the mess of human nature.</p>
<p>The reason that most robotics people</p>
<p>and AI people stay away from humans,</p>
<p>they stay away from the human robot interaction problem,</p>
<p>is because humans are complicated.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re messy, they&rsquo;re hard to control,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re hard to predict stuff about,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re hard to make sense of or like test repeatedly</p>
<p>because one human can be drastically different</p>
<p>from another human.</p>
<p>And so to deal with that as a robotics problem</p>
<p>is super hard.</p>
<p>And so one of the questions is which problems</p>
<p>can you remove the human from consideration</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re trying to solve the problem?</p>
<p>So like Elon Musk is an example of somebody</p>
<p>who believes autonomous driving,</p>
<p>we can remove the human from consideration,</p>
<p>we can solve autonomous driving as a robotics problem.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s stay in the lane.</p>
<p>When there&rsquo;s a red light, you stop at a red light.</p>
<p>If there is humans in the picture like pedestrians,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a ballistics problem.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just treat them as a moving object</p>
<p>that has with like 90% probability</p>
<p>keeps moving in the way they were in the past few seconds</p>
<p>with some smaller probability that might stop or turn.</p>
<p>Just do some basic models about them</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll be able to do just fine.</p>
<p>So I tend to believe that even driving</p>
<p>has to consider the full messiness of humans.</p>
<p>The dance, the game theoretic dance of chicken</p>
<p>that we all do when we jaywalk,</p>
<p>we look at the car, that car doesn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>that driver doesn&rsquo;t have the guts to murder me</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m going to walk in front of it and not look at the car.</p>
<p>We do that kind of dance and AI systems</p>
<p>need to be able to play, do that kind of dance.</p>
<p>In Tolko, there&rsquo;s the labs.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a data science component, there&rsquo;s an AI component.</p>
<p>So how do they go into a company</p>
<p>and help revolutionize that industry?</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s different examples.</p>
<p>So one of our companies, Figs, makes healthcare workwear,</p>
<p>started by these two brilliant women</p>
<p>and early days helping to build the platform and recruit</p>
<p>and make sure that everything that we did</p>
<p>at the company embraced technology</p>
<p>and at the same time, they were obsessive</p>
<p>about their customer, which is doctors, nurses,</p>
<p>healthcare workers who are putting it on the line every day</p>
<p>and obsessive about their product.</p>
<p>And when you have those two things come together,</p>
<p>you get the result that we did at Figs.</p>
<p>We have a company called Acashure,</p>
<p>which it&rsquo;s AI lab and base is down here in Austin, Texas.</p>
<p>It was an insurance,</p>
<p>one of the largest insurance brokers in the world.</p>
<p>And we did a deal with them</p>
<p>and sold some of our insurance holdings</p>
<p>that was completely AI driven.</p>
<p>And in that case, you basically put the team</p>
<p>inside the company, right?</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s a massive company</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ve gone into all kinds of things.</p>
<p>So it just depends on the different situations.</p>
<p>But the biggest thing was just to make sure</p>
<p>whatever the company needed,</p>
<p>they had access to the talent.</p>
<p>Sometimes we&rsquo;d build it, sometimes we&rsquo;d help recruit for it.</p>
<p>You know how in technology, it&rsquo;s whatever works, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no one way to do things.</p>
<p>Well, Acashure is really interesting as an example.</p>
<p>So insurance is a fascinating space.</p>
<p>It seems like very ripe still</p>
<p>for disruption across the board.</p>
<p>So how do you, it seems like a lot of the disruption</p>
<p>has to do with almost the first dump step</p>
<p>of we&rsquo;ve been using mostly paper.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not digitized.</p>
<p>You have to basically create a infrastructure</p>
<p>and a framework where everybody is using</p>
<p>the same digital system, like databases</p>
<p>and just organize the data.</p>
<p>It seems like that&rsquo;s a huge leap</p>
<p>that basically can revolutionize major industries</p>
<p>that still hasn&rsquo;t been done.</p>
<p>Insurance is obviously the great example of that.</p>
<p>And one of the things that struck me,</p>
<p>the founder CEO of Acashure is a guy named Greg Williams.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re out of Grand Rapids, Michigan.</p>
<p>And as we were looking at expanding our footprint</p>
<p>in insurance, I met with a lot of insurance executives.</p>
<p>And they would talk about technology,</p>
<p>but Greg truly understood the power</p>
<p>of what would happen across actuarial sciences,</p>
<p>predictive analytics and using machine learning</p>
<p>to really run every aspect of your business.</p>
<p>And then automating a lot of the,</p>
<p>just the back office tedious steps.</p>
<p>And as you said, one of the things that was great for us,</p>
<p>they already had a data collection system and department.</p>
<p>So it was much easier to pivot.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m very excited about the future of that company.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, they&rsquo;re doing some pretty innovative,</p>
<p>groundbreaking things.</p>
<p>And those are the things that I like doing, right?</p>
<p>Is that, yes, I wanna make money.</p>
<p>Just, that&rsquo;s what that is.</p>
<p>But at the same time,</p>
<p>what did you do with your time on earth, right?</p>
<p>Did you do anything to leave any kind of mark</p>
<p>that you did anything interesting?</p>
<p>I can only speak for myself.</p>
<p>There are many more ways to measure one&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>And I can only speak about how I think about things.</p>
<p>I grew up poor in upstate New York with a single mom</p>
<p>and watched her work a couple of jobs</p>
<p>and had to, from a young age, shovel snow and mow lawns</p>
<p>and do all kinds of things to help her</p>
<p>make sure the lights weren&rsquo;t turned off in our little place.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s just something</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve always been driven towards.</p>
<p>And I just, I have really eclectic tastes and interests.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just been an interesting journey.</p>
<p>So help be part of and help enable</p>
<p>some cool new creations across the board,</p>
<p>like film, music, AI, manufacturing,</p>
<p>just insurance, all the specific industries</p>
<p>that you disrupted, yeah.</p>
<p>Small tangent, back to your childhood with your mom.</p>
<p>Any memories kind of stand out,</p>
<p>stick with you as something</p>
<p>that helped define who you are as a man?</p>
<p>Yeah, even though the university and college experience</p>
<p>was not part of the family tree,</p>
<p>and we had no connections, I didn&rsquo;t understand,</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know what a trust fund was or prep school,</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know what any of that was.</p>
<p>But my mom from a young age would always say,</p>
<p>you know, you&rsquo;re gonna go to college.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no, you know, if you choose to,</p>
<p>and I think from a young age,</p>
<p>that was just an expectation that I had</p>
<p>and that she instilled and the work ethic.</p>
<p>I watched her.</p>
<p>And then my grandmother was a janitor,</p>
<p>a cleaning lady in a hospital for 50 years.</p>
<p>And then I remember there were times of, you know,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m probably 10 years old, it&rsquo;s freezing cold out.</p>
<p>And if I don&rsquo;t go out and shovel six driveways,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t have enough money to pay the bill.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;m not a psychologist,</p>
<p>so I don&rsquo;t know how that manifests itself in my life today.</p>
<p>But I think the grit to say,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not in the mood to do this, I don&rsquo;t wanna do this,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s the work that needs to be done.</p>
<p>And no excuses, not I&rsquo;m a victim</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m gonna sit around and talk about,</p>
<p>no, it is what it is,</p>
<p>and you have to get done what you need to get done.</p>
<p>And again, I think it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>you can never fully put yourself in someone else&rsquo;s shoes</p>
<p>or experience, so I don&rsquo;t know what that is or feels like.</p>
<p>But for me, those were two, I think,</p>
<p>formative things that were important in my childhood.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s pretty, the reality of life like that</p>
<p>is pretty humbling.</p>
<p>You still, you&rsquo;ve been so exceptionally successful</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s easy to get soft now.</p>
<p>How do you get humbled these days?</p>
<p>By getting up.</p>
<p>You know, I think for me personally,</p>
<p>trying to push the envelope</p>
<p>and being weighed and measured, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I always loved sports too.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a scoreboard.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m a huge believer in opportunity, meritocracy,</p>
<p>all those things that I think are ideals</p>
<p>that we wanna aspire to.</p>
<p>And I think that there&rsquo;s a lot of things</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m involved with right now that I just wanna see</p>
<p>if I can do it.</p>
<p>I wanna see if, and you know,</p>
<p>my own little mantra is cause the outcome, right?</p>
<p>As much as you can, and at the same time,</p>
<p>have the humility and not to have the hubris or arrogance</p>
<p>to say I&rsquo;m always gonna cause the outcome.</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;ll get your ass kicked pretty quickly</p>
<p>and humbled.</p>
<p>The world and the universe is a big place</p>
<p>with forces beyond, but I think,</p>
<p>I also think a lot about being intellectually honest,</p>
<p>which when I do university talks and so forth,</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a superpower.</p>
<p>Because if you find yourself making decisions</p>
<p>based on other people&rsquo;s expectations,</p>
<p>based on places you don&rsquo;t wanna go,</p>
<p>but you feel like momentum is taking you there,</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a big problem.</p>
<p>And there are people that go to our top universities</p>
<p>and can&rsquo;t wait to get out and start their own company</p>
<p>and they want that pressure and they want to grind.</p>
<p>And there are other people that are smart and talented,</p>
<p>but just say, look, I don&rsquo;t wanna lay awake</p>
<p>staring at the ceiling wondering</p>
<p>how I&rsquo;m gonna make payroll.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want that in my life.</p>
<p>And I think if you can square that up</p>
<p>and be okay with it and say, what makes me tick?</p>
<p>What makes me happy?</p>
<p>What puts me in a bad head space?</p>
<p>Because there&rsquo;s a difference between challenging yourself</p>
<p>and going against your nature.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why I think that being intellectually honest</p>
<p>and being able to really sit down</p>
<p>and go inside your own head and say,</p>
<p>what am I good at?</p>
<p>What am I not good at?</p>
<p>How am I gonna put myself in a position</p>
<p>to be successful?</p>
<p>Because I&rsquo;m working on my weaknesses,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m not gonna put myself career wise in a position</p>
<p>where I&rsquo;m just fundamentally gonna have a hard time</p>
<p>being successful.</p>
<p>Yeah, intellectually honest is a tricky one.</p>
<p>And it gets, there&rsquo;s like levels to it too.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Because some of the things I think about</p>
<p>when you dream of doing certain kinds of big things,</p>
<p>a part of intellectual honesty is to say several things.</p>
<p>One is like, hey, the thing you&rsquo;re dreaming about,</p>
<p>like one, the fact that nobody&rsquo;s done it</p>
<p>probably shows that you&rsquo;re just a dreamer.</p>
<p>This is not going to, like think clearly.</p>
<p>The fact that it hasn&rsquo;t been done</p>
<p>probably shows that it may not be the right path.</p>
<p>And two is like, if you&rsquo;re dreaming about stuff,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a certain point where it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>hey, you haven&rsquo;t done it.</p>
<p>Like, why haven&rsquo;t you done it already then?</p>
<p>Like you have to be honest with yourself.</p>
<p>Like you have to be ambitious.</p>
<p>Like a lot of people work hard a long time for a dream,</p>
<p>but you have to wake up and be like, all right,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been at this for 10 years.</p>
<p>Like with a startup, you launch a startup</p>
<p>and you think, okay, one year, two years,</p>
<p>three years, four years, pretty successful,</p>
<p>but it hasn&rsquo;t exploded like you dreamed</p>
<p>and you have to shut it down.</p>
<p>You have to be intellectually honest there.</p>
<p>At the same time, you might want to be,</p>
<p>like step it up, lean into it.</p>
<p>Say almost like the flip side of like intellectual honesty</p>
<p>is like maddening ambition of just saying, fuck it,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to go all in.</p>
<p>But that is a kind of intellectual honesty saying like,</p>
<p>you know, the big problem here is I&rsquo;ve been kind of going,</p>
<p>doing too many things.</p>
<p>Maybe with this dream, you have to go all in on it.</p>
<p>All those kinds of things.</p>
<p>I mean, this is human experience, it&rsquo;s complicated.</p>
<p>Yes, all human things are complicated.</p>
<p>And I think there&rsquo;s a difference between being reckless</p>
<p>and making well thought out informed decisions.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re going to go all in,</p>
<p>make sure you&rsquo;ve measured twice, cut once, as they say.</p>
<p>And one of my other favorite, I forget,</p>
<p>many years ago, I heard this saying and it stayed with me.</p>
<p>It was never mistake, clear line of sight</p>
<p>with distance and you know that.</p>
<p>So I think that the key, whether you&rsquo;re starting a business</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re thinking about leaving the company you&rsquo;re at</p>
<p>and starting a business or just leaving for another job,</p>
<p>any of these things is as much as you can, right?</p>
<p>And psychologists, I think would tell us,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard to be self aware completely, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the rub that if we were all completely self aware</p>
<p>of everything that we did and strengthen weaknesses,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;d be a different world.</p>
<p>But I do think you can work on that</p>
<p>and at least challenge yourself to think about it</p>
<p>and not be in a position where I&rsquo;m going to medical school</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s what you do in my family</p>
<p>and even though I&rsquo;m miserable doing it,</p>
<p>things like that.</p>
<p>So definitely you don&rsquo;t want to be sort of,</p>
<p>because you don&rsquo;t think fall victim to conformity.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just go on doing the same thing over and over.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>But at the same time, is measure twice and cut once.</p>
<p>It does feel like some of the biggest leaps taken</p>
<p>are where you cut once and measure later.</p>
<p>Is you leap in first.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like a gut, I suppose that is a measurement,</p>
<p>but you build up a good gut instinct of what to do</p>
<p>and then you just do it and then you figure out,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the building the airplane as you&rsquo;re flying it.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Well, and I think each one of those instances</p>
<p>that you could probably cite</p>
<p>has its own unique circumstances, right?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have a deep biotech background,</p>
<p>so if I suddenly stood up and said,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna put everything I have into this idea,</p>
<p>well, those are, it&rsquo;s game theory, right?</p>
<p>What are the odds of success?</p>
<p>If on the other hand, you&rsquo;re brilliant in your field</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;ve seen some opportunity</p>
<p>that you think is wide open</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re gonna go for it and break stuff, that&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>You just wanna, to me, always say like,</p>
<p>how crazy is this on the spectrum of,</p>
<p>do I have any expertise?</p>
<p>What is the downside if I fail, right?</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re at a certain point in life with young children</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve got a mortgage and whatever else,</p>
<p>that is one circumstance versus I just got out of Stanford</p>
<p>or I just got out of whatever and I&rsquo;m gonna go for it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just the whole thing, right?</p>
<p>It is complex as you point out.</p>
<p>And sometimes you just wanna have the right matrix</p>
<p>in your head of decision making process</p>
<p>to try to arrive at the right place.</p>
<p>And even if you get close, that&rsquo;s where I think you say,</p>
<p>you know what, the hell with it, I&rsquo;m doing this.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>I do wanna ask you about one specific idea</p>
<p>that sounds super fascinating</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re involved with recently.</p>
<p>You led the $50 million seed round</p>
<p>for a company called Colossal</p>
<p>that is focused on deextinction.</p>
<p>This is funny relative to our connection</p>
<p>and conversation about Jurassic World.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re seeking to restore lost ecosystems</p>
<p>and use gene editing to restore the woolly mammoth</p>
<p>to the Arctic tundra.</p>
<p>How are they gonna do that?</p>
<p>Well, I met this fascinating guy at Harvard</p>
<p>named George Church five, six years ago,</p>
<p>and found him to be incredibly smart, have an imagination.</p>
<p>And he partnered up with a guy named Ben Lamb,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s an entrepreneur.</p>
<p>And basically the press and to me the imaginative,</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;re capturing my imagination by telling me</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna bring back the woolly mammoth</p>
<p>and other extinct animals.</p>
<p>And I, you know, we&rsquo;ll see where that road leads.</p>
<p>I was more interested in an investor</p>
<p>in the things that they&rsquo;re working through</p>
<p>around understanding genes and proteins</p>
<p>and CRISPR and all these other things</p>
<p>because being adjacent to George Church and his team</p>
<p>as these things unfold over the next decade,</p>
<p>I thought was the right thing to do.</p>
<p>So people are important here,</p>
<p>just like investing people and seeing</p>
<p>what the hell they come up with.</p>
<p>Absolutely, I mean, you can look through history</p>
<p>and great things are done by great people, right?</p>
<p>And companies, they end up over time becoming a logo</p>
<p>and immediately what you think of them,</p>
<p>but they started out with a person, with an idea</p>
<p>and a team that cultivated that and made that happen.</p>
<p>And I think there are certain folks</p>
<p>that are just immensely talented</p>
<p>that if you can be around them,</p>
<p>and I also know his and his team&rsquo;s ethics</p>
<p>in terms of, you know, after spending time</p>
<p>talking about where the lines are,</p>
<p>people in other countries that, you know,</p>
<p>may not have the same process,</p>
<p>may not have the same checks and balances,</p>
<p>are doing this and pursuing this regardless.</p>
<p>So at least I felt like with George and Ben and their teams,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re also very responsible people.</p>
<p>This is where the human side of things comes into play.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve interacted with a lot of really brilliant people</p>
<p>in the technology space where you kind of,</p>
<p>you know, there&rsquo;s a lot of ways to feel this out.</p>
<p>You can ask them whether they kind of read literature.</p>
<p>You can feel out how much do they really understand</p>
<p>about like human nature here.</p>
<p>Like whatever the technology is,</p>
<p>when it actually starts to play,</p>
<p>interact with society at scale,</p>
<p>like do they have an understanding</p>
<p>or an intuition about how that happens?</p>
<p>Some of that requires studying history.</p>
<p>Some of that requires like just looking at</p>
<p>the worst and best parts and events in human history</p>
<p>to understand like, hey, it doesn&rsquo;t always turn out</p>
<p>like everybody hoped the technology turns out.</p>
<p>If a person has a depth of understanding about history,</p>
<p>about human nature, then I think that&rsquo;s the right person</p>
<p>to mess with some of this cutting edge stuff.</p>
<p>Now you want Marcus Aurelius with a PhD from MIT.</p>
<p>Exactly, exactly.</p>
<p>Just small tangent, but you mentioned having a conversation</p>
<p>with Warren Buffett, you spoke really highly of him</p>
<p>as an investor, as a human being.</p>
<p>What about him do you admire?</p>
<p>What from him, what insights have you drawn from him</p>
<p>as a great investor yourself?</p>
<p>Well, the afternoon that I got to spend with him,</p>
<p>which is something I&rsquo;ll treasure forever.</p>
<p>Look, sometimes when you meet people,</p>
<p>even that are immensely successful,</p>
<p>you may decide that after 20 minutes or a half hour,</p>
<p>oh, you were in the right place at the right time</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>There are other people that are clearly different,</p>
<p>special, and I don&rsquo;t care if you made them start from zero,</p>
<p>you know, would end up in a good place.</p>
<p>And so it was an absolute privilege</p>
<p>to spend the time with him.</p>
<p>You know, and a couple of things that stood out</p>
<p>in the conversation, he is incredibly intellectually curious</p>
<p>and well read, and I like how simplistic he likes</p>
<p>to keep his thought matrix.</p>
<p>And then also, instead of trying to outsmart the market,</p>
<p>it seems like a simple axiom, but just look,</p>
<p>good companies that are led by talented managers</p>
<p>that are good businesses over time are gonna get there.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not gonna day trade, I&rsquo;m just gonna,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking for value.</p>
<p>And then just on life stuff, he just, you know,</p>
<p>and also his ability to take in</p>
<p>and then use information was incredibly impressive.</p>
<p>So I only spent the, you know, I&rsquo;d met him before,</p>
<p>but I only spent one afternoon with him,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s, you know, pretty incredible.</p>
<p>And one of the things that stuck out to me</p>
<p>is we were in the middle of talking about Tolko</p>
<p>or investing or how we thought about it.</p>
<p>And I said, you know, I&rsquo;m trying to be smart about,</p>
<p>and he stopped me and he said, Charlie Munger,</p>
<p>his partner of many years, Charlie and I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t try to think of the smart thing to do.</p>
<p>We try to think what&rsquo;s the dumb thing we could do here.</p>
<p>And I kind of laughed and he said, no, I&rsquo;m dead serious.</p>
<p>We think about it from the standpoint of</p>
<p>what could we do in this situation that later</p>
<p>we&rsquo;d be like, that was a really dumb thing to do.</p>
<p>And I actually thought that was, it got in my head.</p>
<p>And I still think a lot about that</p>
<p>as I&rsquo;m dissecting problems.</p>
<p>So there is, like, that&rsquo;s a kind of longterm thinking</p>
<p>if you just avoid the dumb things,</p>
<p>or if you simplify, just focus on those simple steps,</p>
<p>all it takes is just do that for a long period of time</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll be successful.</p>
<p>Well, it certainly worked for him, that&rsquo;s all I can say.</p>
<p>What about you?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve been a great investor yourself.</p>
<p>How do you know, when you judge people,</p>
<p>so I, whenever I go to San Francisco,</p>
<p>I was thinking of moving to San Francisco.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I decided to, after really giving it</p>
<p>some thought, talking to people, decided to move to Austin.</p>
<p>You know, everybody&rsquo;s dreaming big and they have big plans.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s actually, I don&rsquo;t envy the job of an investor</p>
<p>of any kind, because everybody has big dreams</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s hard to know who exactly,</p>
<p>what idea is going to materialize,</p>
<p>what team is going to materialize into something great.</p>
<p>How do you make those decisions about people, about ideas?</p>
<p>Well, if I had any kind of a lattice work on this,</p>
<p>it absolutely starts with the people.</p>
<p>And I think the reason for that is your business plan</p>
<p>is going to change, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s very few businesses I know of that say,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna make a widget in this location</p>
<p>and 30 years later, we&rsquo;re successful</p>
<p>and we just make a widget and that&rsquo;s what it is.</p>
<p>Things happen, right?</p>
<p>And today they happen with such velocity</p>
<p>that you have to be able to make hard decisions</p>
<p>based on imperfect information.</p>
<p>And are you, how are you going to calculate those answers?</p>
<p>How self interested are you going to be?</p>
<p>What kind of ethics will you apply?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your short term versus long term thinking?</p>
<p>Are you able to give an honest assessment of a situation?</p>
<p>Because the thing that you can count on</p>
<p>is problems are gonna happen.</p>
<p>Things you didn&rsquo;t anticipate are gonna happen.</p>
<p>How pliable are you, right?</p>
<p>How much elasticity is there in your ability</p>
<p>to be successful?</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s important when you invest in something</p>
<p>that you both see, you understand the roadmap ahead</p>
<p>and agree to it, right?</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t mean there won&rsquo;t be twists and turns,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re not like, whoa, wait a minute,</p>
<p>what did we do here?</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t what was in the thing I signed up for.</p>
<p>And then I think honesty and communication</p>
<p>is a huge thing to me with,</p>
<p>I always tell people if bi directionally,</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s something going on,</p>
<p>start the conversation with, Lex, we have a problem.</p>
<p>Okay, now I&rsquo;m sitting up, you have my full attention,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna talk about whatever it is.</p>
<p>Bad news should travel faster than good news.</p>
<p>And because it&rsquo;s going to happen,</p>
<p>being in business with someone</p>
<p>that is gonna shoot you straight</p>
<p>and sometimes say, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what the answer is.</p>
<p>I gotta go figure it out.</p>
<p>That I can process a lot better than,</p>
<p>look, I don&rsquo;t want you mad at me or disappointed</p>
<p>or I can&rsquo;t handle not having success.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re just gonna kick the can.</p>
<p>And I think, especially in today&rsquo;s business environment,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s very, very dangerous.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a bad sign, not just because it&rsquo;s good</p>
<p>to communicate and be honest,</p>
<p>but if they&rsquo;re not willing to do that,</p>
<p>then it goes back to the intellectual honesty.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re probably not also able to be brutally honest</p>
<p>with themselves when they look in the mirror</p>
<p>about the direction of the company.</p>
<p>But look, I wasn&rsquo;t there, so I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>But I think if you unpack many situations</p>
<p>that turned out negatively,</p>
<p>most of the people, whether you&rsquo;re faking lab results,</p>
<p>you have a biotech company,</p>
<p>everybody&rsquo;s staring at Theranos these days.</p>
<p>Do I think in a lot of cases, you&rsquo;re either the villain,</p>
<p>like you started out saying,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna screw my shareholders over</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m gonna be a liar, that isn&rsquo;t my experience.</p>
<p>Most things are little incremental moves that you say,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna get this right next week,</p>
<p>but today we gotta make the presentation.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re gonna just tweak things a little bit.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a slippery slope, right?</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s why I think from a standpoint of people,</p>
<p>you wanna go into the foxhole with folks that,</p>
<p>you know, understand things are gonna happen</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m gonna let you know about them</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re gonna try to solve them together.</p>
<p>And then just in terms of the idea,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s, I always ask like, okay,</p>
<p>if this company executed the way,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the other thing that always cracks me up</p>
<p>about financials, whenever somebody pitches you,</p>
<p>inevitably they&rsquo;ll say,</p>
<p>our projections are really, really conservative.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still waiting for somebody to come in and say,</p>
<p>look, my projections are wildly optimistic.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll never hit these numbers, but anyway,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s, you know, if this company did what it says</p>
<p>and executes and does it matter, right?</p>
<p>Does it move the needle enough?</p>
<p>And what are the things that uniquely position</p>
<p>this company to be successful?</p>
<p>And you just have to be able to answer,</p>
<p>I think a number of those questions pretty crisply.</p>
<p>But at the end of the day, it&rsquo;s still a big risk.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re just trying to minimize the risk.</p>
<p>Let me jump to another topic.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re an incredible human being</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re involved with this.</p>
<p>Your band, Ghost Hounds, is touring with the Rolling Stones.</p>
<p>So before we talk about your band, let me ask about that.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s that like, playing with the Rolling Stones?</p>
<p>Surreal, just because they&rsquo;re my favorite band of all time.</p>
<p>To me, the greatest rock and roll band,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not even close, of all time.</p>
<p>And, you know, to share the same stage,</p>
<p>to be on tour and to go out</p>
<p>and get that energy from the crowd, you know,</p>
<p>and every night and come off stage</p>
<p>and later when they go on and you hear that iconic,</p>
<p>ladies and gentlemen, the Rolling Stones.</p>
<p>And then it&rsquo;s incredible.</p>
<p>And, you know, what&rsquo;s amazing to me about the band,</p>
<p>next year will be their 60th anniversary, 60 years.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s hard to be around anything for that long,</p>
<p>but making music and packing stadiums.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s amazing to me, they can play a two hour set</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not just that, oh, that&rsquo;s a hit or you recognize it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like every song is an anthem, right?</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s been amazing.</p>
<p>We got to play with them in 2019.</p>
<p>And when they ask us to do this again,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just an absolute privilege.</p>
<p>I asked you this offline,</p>
<p>so I know you are a kind of rockstar,</p>
<p>but just me, maybe I&rsquo;m projecting,</p>
<p>but do you get nervous, such a large audience</p>
<p>with the Rolling Stones?</p>
<p>It feels like there&rsquo;ll be a lot of pressure.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, you definitely don&rsquo;t want to screw it up.</p>
<p>I think our band is tight knit and all that stuff.</p>
<p>And I think that the individual nervousness dissipates</p>
<p>when you go out as a group and you&rsquo;re making music together</p>
<p>and you sort of, okay, we&rsquo;re all in this</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re doing a thing, which is why even in sports,</p>
<p>I always look at individual events like ice skating</p>
<p>or anything where it&rsquo;s just you out there alone.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s different than being with a team and nerve wracking.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m sure if it was me with an acoustic guitar</p>
<p>just going out, it would feel different,</p>
<p>but absolutely you get the right kind of butterflies,</p>
<p>I would call it.</p>
<p>And just the energy of playing music</p>
<p>and having it be this relationship and look, I get it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been to a ton of concerts where I&rsquo;m like,</p>
<p>look, can we just get to the band please?</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s been great is just an amazing reception.</p>
<p>And we have this guy named Trey Nation</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s the lead singer who&rsquo;s just incredibly talented.</p>
<p>I mean, he&rsquo;s just not only an amazing voice,</p>
<p>but just has that charismatic thing.</p>
<p>Yeah, he&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fun.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s it feel like to play in front of a huge audience?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s, as a guitarist, are you lost in the music?</p>
<p>Like you almost don&rsquo;t feel the audience.</p>
<p>Does it add extra energy?</p>
<p>Does it add extra anxiety?</p>
<p>What does it feel like?</p>
<p>You know, stadiums are interesting</p>
<p>just because it&rsquo;s so big and cavernous.</p>
<p>And because you want to protect your ears.</p>
<p>So we use an in ear system</p>
<p>so that you are a little disconnected from the crowd.</p>
<p>Because if you&rsquo;re playing that loud</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re standing in front of your amps</p>
<p>without ear protection, that&rsquo;s bad.</p>
<p>How are you monitoring the sound?</p>
<p>The in ear stuff, is that producing sound</p>
<p>or is it strictly ear plugs?</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s producing the sound.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like putting ear pods in and listening to a song</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re playing to it, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just us playing, but it protects your ears.</p>
<p>But the energy from the crowd,</p>
<p>when they get going and get into it,</p>
<p>which Knock On Wood so far has been amazing,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s nothing like it.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s just this bi directional thing that happens.</p>
<p>And music and sports were kind of my first loves.</p>
<p>And yeah, it&rsquo;s very difficult to describe,</p>
<p>I think accurately, because it&rsquo;s like no other feeling.</p>
<p>Musically, how is it different than playing in a garage</p>
<p>with the band by yourself practicing?</p>
<p>Like, do you feel like you&rsquo;re creating something different</p>
<p>when you got the guitar and the amp</p>
<p>and just the sound dissipating out</p>
<p>and everybody&rsquo;s listening, is that?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, listen, the first time we did it</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s nobody in the stadium,</p>
<p>first time I ever played in the stadium.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m just like, I&rsquo;m out there in front</p>
<p>and just hitting different chords</p>
<p>and playing different licks.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, it&rsquo;s like I won a contest</p>
<p>and I get to do this.</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s different about it,</p>
<p>and each venue is different.</p>
<p>So if you, we went on the road with ZZ Top a few years ago,</p>
<p>which was incredible.</p>
<p>Love Billy Gibbons, he&rsquo;s a Texan.</p>
<p>Incredible person and guitar player.</p>
<p>But when you&rsquo;re playing in like five to 7,000 seats,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really, I mean, it&rsquo;s, you&rsquo;re right there with them,</p>
<p>with the crowd.</p>
<p>And then when you play in an arena,</p>
<p>we toured with Bob Seger on his last tour, which was cool.</p>
<p>Played some shows with him.</p>
<p>And again, the arena, like they&rsquo;re all kind of packed</p>
<p>on top of you.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s super loud, which was cool.</p>
<p>Meaning the crowd is,</p>
<p>stadiums is a completely different animal.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just a completely different experience.</p>
<p>Do you enjoy it versus like a smaller room?</p>
<p>What, as a guitarist, as a musician,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s your favorite like room to play of the size?</p>
<p>Any room that&rsquo;ll have me.</p>
<p>You know, look, I think arenas are the perfect blend.</p>
<p>If I had to say, because it&rsquo;s loud and, you know,</p>
<p>20, 30,000 people, but like right up, right up on you.</p>
<p>A stadium, look, playing the stadiums with the Rolling</p>
<p>Stones, it just is gonna go on the head marker somewhere</p>
<p>is one of the more, you know, I say this,</p>
<p>and I really mean it.</p>
<p>My life is like a punked episode that just hasn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>no one&rsquo;s burst in yet, but yeah,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s as cool as you think it is.</p>
<p>So 60 years, how do you think Mick Jagger still got it?</p>
<p>How do you explain it?</p>
<p>I gotta tell you something.</p>
<p>I mean, the funny thing is whatever,</p>
<p>wherever there is excellence,</p>
<p>people wanna know how&rsquo;d you do it, right?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the secret?</p>
<p>Not only is Mick Jagger, and I think the songs</p>
<p>that Keith Richards and Mick Jagger wrote together,</p>
<p>if you go back and listen to the lyrics,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just incredibly poignant,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m just a huge Stones fan, so,</p>
<p>but he works out like a maniac, right?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s that 10,000 hours thing,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s that, hey, maybe I don&rsquo;t feel my best today,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m gonna get up and do my routine and work out</p>
<p>so that at his age, which, I mean,</p>
<p>you can look at people at different ages chronologically</p>
<p>that are, maybe we&rsquo;re both at this age,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m a lot older than you are, and vice versa.</p>
<p>And he just, I think it&rsquo;s the combination of raw talent</p>
<p>and the ability, and he&rsquo;s very smart, right?</p>
<p>Like he understands how to have interaction with a crowd</p>
<p>and hold them in the palm of his hand</p>
<p>and be an entertainer, but then on top of that,</p>
<p>the reason he can at this age run around stadiums</p>
<p>and be just as energetic is he puts the work in.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s one thing, step that I think</p>
<p>a lot of people miss sometimes,</p>
<p>where they want that magic trick,</p>
<p>they wanna know what&rsquo;s the shortcut.</p>
<p>Most of the time, the answer is there&rsquo;s no shortcut.</p>
<p>Yeah, you have to work hard on the way there</p>
<p>and work hard to stay on top.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>And sometimes it&rsquo;s not even like work hard,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just like be a professional,</p>
<p>which that involves, in his case, at his age,</p>
<p>with the amount of stuff you have to do on stage</p>
<p>and the way he does it.</p>
<p>For two hours.</p>
<p>You have, this is a professional athlete.</p>
<p>A professional athlete that has to do things</p>
<p>that are probably designed for 20 year olds</p>
<p>and 30 year olds has to do it at an older age,</p>
<p>which means what do you have to do?</p>
<p>Well, he probably has a whole physical routine</p>
<p>he has to do.</p>
<p>Diet, the whole thing.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s hard, look, if you wanna do great things,</p>
<p>you probably have to do hard things to get there.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not gonna make you pick,</p>
<p>just stick on the stones for one more minute.</p>
<p>But what are some great Rolling Stones songs</p>
<p>that were impactful to you, lyrically, musically,</p>
<p>maybe something you like playing, like air guitar.</p>
<p>Oh, sure.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Probably my favorites, I love Sympathy for the Devil.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very, I don&rsquo;t know, sort of Faustian.</p>
<p>I love the lyrics.</p>
<p>I love how the, almost a voodoo beat</p>
<p>just kind of builds throughout the song.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s always been one of my favorites.</p>
<p>So in that song, he never mentions Devil, does he?</p>
<p>No, wait, sorry.</p>
<p>Like, you know my name.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s like a flirtation going on in the lyrics.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of interesting.</p>
<p>Yeah, here&rsquo;s all the trouble I&rsquo;ve caused along the way</p>
<p>with you humans.</p>
<p>And I just think it&rsquo;s really, really great.</p>
<p>And musically, it builds really nicely.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like both fun and dark.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s cool.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a playful nature to it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s very stones.</p>
<p>The only, they can pull it off</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s like playful,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also like dark and dangerous, dangerous, dangerous.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And Gimme Shelter is just, you know,</p>
<p>and to this day, when I listen to the studio version</p>
<p>and Mary Clayton just comes on and sings that epic,</p>
<p>iconic part.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a documentary that was done</p>
<p>about backup singers, phenomenal.</p>
<p>And it tells the story of that moment</p>
<p>in that song with Mary Clayton.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just her voice and the way it unfolded,</p>
<p>they got her out of bed at like 10 o clock at night in LA.</p>
<p>And she&rsquo;s like the Rolling Stones,</p>
<p>and went in and just killed it.</p>
<p>And I can&rsquo;t sing at all.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m by ordinance not allowed around a microphone.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m always in awe when someone can sing like that.</p>
<p>But, you know, those are,</p>
<p>those are some of my favorite Rolling Stones songs</p>
<p>and Painted Black&rsquo;s awesome.</p>
<p>I mean, I could go on and on.</p>
<p>Yeah, Painted Black is great.</p>
<p>Again, a song that builds as bad as,</p>
<p>I mean, it defines a whole generation.</p>
<p>What made you pick up a guitar?</p>
<p>What made you fall in love with the guitar?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just the coolest instrument, right?</p>
<p>I mean, when you watched back then,</p>
<p>and I was kind of an old soul.</p>
<p>I was listening at a fairly young age to Muddy Waters,</p>
<p>Robert Johnson, Lightning Hopkins, BB King,</p>
<p>and just the soulfulness.</p>
<p>Thrills gone.</p>
<p>Oh my, I mean, BB plays five notes and just kills it</p>
<p>and the emotion that it evokes.</p>
<p>So I just was just in awe of the instrument.</p>
<p>And I also, there&rsquo;s always somebody around who&rsquo;s a musician</p>
<p>that just picks the instrument up and can play, right?</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re just so talented at it.</p>
<p>And they can just listen to a record and play it.</p>
<p>That was never me.</p>
<p>I never took formal lessons.</p>
<p>I had to grind to just make it sound</p>
<p>like I wanted it to sound.</p>
<p>So both technically and ear, everything was hard work.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, I could hear it and what they call,</p>
<p>you know, you play.</p>
<p>So my right hand, the rhythm side of it is,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s probably if I have anything, my strength.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s something pretty amazing that happens</p>
<p>when you get together with other people and play a song</p>
<p>in that moment where it hits the pocket</p>
<p>and you all kind of know it.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just such a cool feeling.</p>
<p>And it was interesting growing up because I was,</p>
<p>again, I always had eclectic interests.</p>
<p>So I loved math and physics and science.</p>
<p>So I had those friends and I was an athlete</p>
<p>and played football and baseball and basketball.</p>
<p>So I had my jock friends, and then I had my music friends</p>
<p>and so it was just kind of that.</p>
<p>And so when I was still living in Los Angeles</p>
<p>and had Legendary, I just missed playing.</p>
<p>And so I put this band together</p>
<p>and called it the Ghost Hounds because again,</p>
<p>huge Robert Johnson fan and that legend of Robert Johnson</p>
<p>selling his soul at the crossroads</p>
<p>in exchange for his musical talent.</p>
<p>And you guys have that in one of the videos.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Such a cool video.</p>
<p>Exactly, so I just thought that&rsquo;s such cool lore.</p>
<p>I just love the blues.</p>
<p>So Robert Johnson would often talk about hellhounds</p>
<p>on his trail.</p>
<p>And so I always just thought, huh, what about ghost towns?</p>
<p>So I wish it were a more clever, deeper story,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s about it for the name.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s pretty deep, Robert Johnson&rsquo;s incredible.</p>
<p>But you also talk about that you connect</p>
<p>to the storytelling of blues.</p>
<p>So what makes a good story in a song?</p>
<p>Like what aspect of storytelling connects with you in song?</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m a big lyrics guy too.</p>
<p>I love like deep lyric people like Tom Waits</p>
<p>and like people that are like Leonard Cohen,</p>
<p>like even Bob Dylan, they&rsquo;re like obviously, it&rsquo;s poetry.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s some people like the Rolling Stones there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like seemingly simpler,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s still so much more to it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like less is often more.</p>
<p>It still tells a strong story.</p>
<p>Yeah, and there&rsquo;s certain people</p>
<p>and Jagger and Mick Jagger and Keith Richards</p>
<p>are in this boat.</p>
<p>Billy Gibbons is in this boat.</p>
<p>They just say things in a certain way</p>
<p>that are just cool, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, and so I write our music and lyrics.</p>
<p>I have to tell a story.</p>
<p>I have to know the characters in the song.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not good at just writing some rhymes</p>
<p>and having it match up to the right key and the right music.</p>
<p>I have to understand like, that&rsquo;s just me.</p>
<p>And so I think that, look,</p>
<p>if you have three or four minutes to tell a story,</p>
<p>you have to be more efficient with your use of language.</p>
<p>And you have to understand what you&rsquo;re building to it</p>
<p>understand what you&rsquo;re building to, if anything,</p>
<p>and evoke emotion.</p>
<p>And hopefully for those three minutes,</p>
<p>get the listener to understand</p>
<p>not only the point of the song,</p>
<p>but where you&rsquo;re coming from</p>
<p>and to make you feel a certain way.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a song that the audience has seemed to like a lot</p>
<p>on the new album called Good Old Days.</p>
<p>And I wrote that because especially during COVID</p>
<p>and reflecting on what normalcy looks like</p>
<p>and what happens when you&rsquo;re cut off,</p>
<p>I just was kind of taken with this idea of</p>
<p>that when you sit around and reminisce with friends,</p>
<p>oftentimes it&rsquo;s not just like some big event happened.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, remember that summer,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;d go up to the lake all the time</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s who you were with.</p>
<p>And at the time, it probably seemed pretty pedestrian.</p>
<p>It just seemed like kind of a normal day,</p>
<p>but it was the company you were keeping.</p>
<p>It was the time in your life.</p>
<p>It was whatever it was.</p>
<p>And I just kind of struck me that right now</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re doing stuff that you&rsquo;re gonna reminisce about later</p>
<p>that seems kind of ordinary to be like,</p>
<p>man, that was such a great time.</p>
<p>So the idea is be in the moment and all that stuff.</p>
<p>But these are the good old days.</p>
<p>And enjoy it and soak it in</p>
<p>and kind of be present for it.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s a great perspective to take on the present</p>
<p>because we are in the thing that we&rsquo;ll remember.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re living through the thing we&rsquo;ll remember.</p>
<p>And sometimes the things we&rsquo;ll remember</p>
<p>is the simple stuff, the little stuff.</p>
<p>Outside of Keith Richards,</p>
<p>who is the greatest, ridiculous question,</p>
<p>but just indulge me,</p>
<p>who is the greatest blues guitarist of all time,</p>
<p>rock guitarist of all time?</p>
<p>Well, you got a little bit of a hybrid</p>
<p>with Jimi Hendrix, right?</p>
<p>Because he played the blues and he played rock and roll.</p>
<p>So I think most guitarists would say</p>
<p>Jimi Hendrix was pretty ridiculous.</p>
<p>That probably for me,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a huge, huge, huge Hendrix fan to play.</p>
<p>He can&rsquo;t, I mean, even to this day,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care, technology, pedals, whatever,</p>
<p>he just somehow fused with the instrument.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t be sitting here in Austin, Texas</p>
<p>without mentioning one of the great guitar players</p>
<p>of all time, Stevie Ray Vaughn.</p>
<p>See, that&rsquo;s how, I know you&rsquo;re like a rock star.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re sucking up to the audience.</p>
<p>Well, no, you have listeners all over the place,</p>
<p>but Stevie Ray Vaughn is another one of those.</p>
<p>That is incredible.</p>
<p>Just blows me away.</p>
<p>And then with the older guys,</p>
<p>BB King, Hubert Sumlin, Clapton.</p>
<p>I saw him on his last tour</p>
<p>and just walked out on my,</p>
<p>just like unbelievable how he still sounds.</p>
<p>And both electric and acoustic, just so strange.</p>
<p>Absolute master.</p>
<p>And the greatest storyteller, you mentioned Bob Seger.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an interesting one.</p>
<p>He almost doesn&rsquo;t get enough credit, I feel like,</p>
<p>for how great he is.</p>
<p>Obviously he&rsquo;s super famous, but.</p>
<p>No, he&rsquo;s, and his voice.</p>
<p>I also, I had the privilege of getting friendly</p>
<p>with John Fogerty, you know, John Fogerty and CCR fame.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s another one that&rsquo;s just the way he phrases things.</p>
<p>And you just look at the catalog of stuff he wrote.</p>
<p>Amazing talent.</p>
<p>I read Bruce Springsteen&rsquo;s book</p>
<p>and was, I&rsquo;m a fan, but after reading the book,</p>
<p>it was really, you go back and listen to his lyrics</p>
<p>and the way he pours himself out is pretty incredible.</p>
<p>And then again, with the old blues guys,</p>
<p>I just think the emotion they could get out of</p>
<p>playing like, staying on the one, right?</p>
<p>Just playing the same rhythm.</p>
<p>John Lee Hooker.</p>
<p>You listen to Manish Boy by Muddy Waters</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just, there&rsquo;s something so,</p>
<p>it just draws me in every time.</p>
<p>And the emotion they&rsquo;re able to get out of things.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m also a huge Chuck Berry fan.</p>
<p>I just think that sound is, I love it.</p>
<p>Do you know how to play Johnny B. Goode?</p>
<p>I do.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>Maybe one of the great moments, at least of my childhood,</p>
<p>was back to the future and watching Michael J. Fox plug in</p>
<p>and then at the end, play at the dance</p>
<p>to save his parents with Johnny B. Goode, pretty awesome.</p>
<p>Yeah, the guitar is so much more than a musical instrument.</p>
<p>It feels like, it&rsquo;s like the,</p>
<p>in the 20th century, it&rsquo;s like the car.</p>
<p>Like it defines so much of Hollywood,</p>
<p>so much of a generation of what it means to be,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, what it means to be a man,</p>
<p>what it means to be a human in America.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>Emblematic to me of a certain type of music.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, I made a documentary years ago</p>
<p>called It Might Get Loud with Jimmy Page, The Edge.</p>
<p>I highly recommend that everybody watch that documentary.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an incredible celebration of the guitar.</p>
<p>Yeah, it says Jimmy Page, Jack White from White Stripes.</p>
<p>The Edge.</p>
<p>And The Edge from U2.</p>
<p>Okay, all right.</p>
<p>Well, now you have to tell the story of that one</p>
<p>because how the heck did that all come together?</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s so fascinating,</p>
<p>such different musicians all coming together,</p>
<p>talking about their story,</p>
<p>talking about how they approach the music</p>
<p>and also playing together a little bit</p>
<p>in this casual kind of setting.</p>
<p>Well, look, one day I came downstairs</p>
<p>and the Rolling Stone magazine is sitting there</p>
<p>and it was the 50 top guitarists of all time, their list.</p>
<p>And then I had some other financial report with video games</p>
<p>and the top video game at the time was Guitar Hero, right?</p>
<p>And then there was a third thing, I can&rsquo;t recall it,</p>
<p>but I just, and I said to myself,</p>
<p>what is it about the guitar that is so central</p>
<p>to the rock and roll, whatever you wanna call it?</p>
<p>Like, why is that the symbol?</p>
<p>And I said to myself, I wanna ask Jimmy Page</p>
<p>why he picked up the guitar,</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s Jimmy Page, right?</p>
<p>And so I called a friend of mine, Davis Guggenheim,</p>
<p>who had directed Inconvenient Truth,</p>
<p>and I think still is,</p>
<p>but at the time was the biggest documentary ever.</p>
<p>And I called Davis and I said, look, I have this idea.</p>
<p>I wanna make this movie about the guitar,</p>
<p>about different eras and styles and whatever,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve never made a documentary.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how to do that.</p>
<p>So I was just looking for advice.</p>
<p>And thankfully, because he&rsquo;s one</p>
<p>of the best documentarians ever, Davis is like,</p>
<p>you know what, I can&rsquo;t get this out of my head.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll direct it, which was amazing.</p>
<p>And we wrote three names down</p>
<p>that represented different eras and different styles.</p>
<p>Rarely do you get, you go three for three,</p>
<p>but it was those three guys.</p>
<p>And it was just such a incredible experience</p>
<p>to sit there and get to know Jimmy Page.</p>
<p>You know, I mean, it was like,</p>
<p>and he was like Gandalf, man.</p>
<p>He was like always Jimmy Page.</p>
<p>And&hellip;</p>
<p>That was so cool to see him.</p>
<p>Gandalf was, there&rsquo;s like a wisdom,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a calmness to him compared</p>
<p>to like the restlessness of Jack White.</p>
<p>Like the, I mean, that combination was just fascinating.</p>
<p>It was one of the coolest experiences ever.</p>
<p>And one of the things, there was a moment</p>
<p>where Jimmy, he was going through his guitar case</p>
<p>and he had the double neck from stairway to heaven</p>
<p>and he handed it to me and I was like, mm hmm.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s like somebody handing you X caliber or something.</p>
<p>Amazing experience.</p>
<p>And The Edge, one of the kindest human beings</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll ever meet in your life.</p>
<p>Just an amazing person.</p>
<p>And I think he hit it right on the head with Jack</p>
<p>is he&rsquo;s got that energy, you know,</p>
<p>and constantly pushing himself.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s hard to believe it&rsquo;s been, I think 10 or 11</p>
<p>or maybe even 12 years since it came out, but.</p>
<p>After watching it, I realized like how much it was needed.</p>
<p>And I was almost surprised it didn&rsquo;t already exist.</p>
<p>It was like, yeah, the guitar wasn&rsquo;t quite celebrated</p>
<p>like explicitly.</p>
<p>We almost didn&rsquo;t acknowledge it.</p>
<p>How important it was culturally.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of amazing.</p>
<p>And the way it closed from the song, the.</p>
<p>The Wait.</p>
<p>It was called The Wait, yeah, by the band.</p>
<p>Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s because they didn&rsquo;t want to go home.</p>
<p>We were shooting on a Warner Brothers soundstage</p>
<p>for three days when we called it The Summit</p>
<p>where the three of them came together.</p>
<p>And the two things I&rsquo;ll never forget</p>
<p>is when Jimmy starts to play the riff</p>
<p>from Whole Lotta Love.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Edge and Jack ceased to be rock, you know,</p>
<p>rock gods or whatever,</p>
<p>and had the same 15 year old kid feeling that I did.</p>
<p>You could see in their face.</p>
<p>And then at the end, they&rsquo;re like, hey, can we play?</p>
<p>We just want to, we don&rsquo;t want to go.</p>
<p>Can we just play something acoustically?</p>
<p>So we printed out the lyrics.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what they wanted to play.</p>
<p>And they just sat there and sat on those couches</p>
<p>and just.</p>
<p>Such a good way to end.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Incredible.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your guitar rig setup like?</p>
<p>You have a few guitars.</p>
<p>First, let&rsquo;s just put on the line.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s better, Les Paul or Strat?</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m not going to get into what&rsquo;s better</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m sure that&rsquo;ll start a flood of whatever.</p>
<p>For me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to say it&rsquo;s Strat.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a Les Paul.</p>
<p>My main instrument is a Les Paul.</p>
<p>But I, okay, let me just put it on the table.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m speaking as somebody who literally,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever actually strummed a chord</p>
<p>on a Les Paul.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve been, maybe I&rsquo;m uninitiated.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t speak from experience,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s probably because of Hendrix</p>
<p>is so deeply influenced by Hendrix</p>
<p>that I just kind of follow in his footsteps</p>
<p>and clap them and so on.</p>
<p>The amazing thing to me is if you look back at Leo Fender</p>
<p>and what the Gibson Guitar Company and Les Paul did</p>
<p>in the fifties, those are still the shapes</p>
<p>and the perfect thing today, right?</p>
<p>The Strat and the Telecaster and the Les Paul.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s, they got it right way back, way back then.</p>
<p>So I have my main guitar, you got to name your guitar.</p>
<p>So my main guitar is named Hazel and it&rsquo;s a 59 Les Paul.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s something magical in that year,</p>
<p>like a Stradivarius and they&rsquo;re just,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something different about them.</p>
<p>So I play that and then I play it through sort of</p>
<p>my main rig is either a 59 Fender Twin or a 65 Marshall.</p>
<p>And then when we&rsquo;re on the road now,</p>
<p>cause when you use older vintage stuff,</p>
<p>you just got to be super careful with the tubes</p>
<p>and everything, it has to be reliable.</p>
<p>So very nicely, the guys from Two Rock</p>
<p>sent me some of their amps and they&rsquo;re really,</p>
<p>cause I don&rsquo;t use any new stuff,</p>
<p>but the Two Rock stuff is pretty great.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s actually what I&rsquo;m using.</p>
<p>Oh, it gets close to the sound that you like</p>
<p>with the Marshall.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s new and reliable.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m using on the road right now.</p>
<p>Do people use like emulation?</p>
<p>Do they use software?</p>
<p>Is it still?</p>
<p>They do.</p>
<p>I personally don&rsquo;t, I go, I don&rsquo;t have many pedals.</p>
<p>I use a Klon, an old vintage Klon straight into the amp.</p>
<p>As old school as possible.</p>
<p>Is there other cool guitars you have</p>
<p>that kind of stand out?</p>
<p>I have a bunch of what they call Blackguard Telecasters</p>
<p>from the 50s, which are pretty great.</p>
<p>What are those, Blackguard Telecasters?</p>
<p>Yeah, so they just, you know, it&rsquo;s in the 50s.</p>
<p>Oh, they actually legit have a Blackguard.</p>
<p>Pickguard.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re incredible, so.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the color of the Telecaster itself?</p>
<p>Most of them are yellow with black</p>
<p>and then they got into different configurations,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s something, I have a 51 Telecaster</p>
<p>that I play in Open G, and in songs with Open G,</p>
<p>that just, again, there&rsquo;s something, you know,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll take all the help I can get</p>
<p>in terms of making it sound great.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll try to find the magic ones.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your writing process like</p>
<p>for the music and the lyrics?</p>
<p>Is there, do you have to go to the mountains?</p>
<p>Is there whiskey involved?</p>
<p>What do you have to do?</p>
<p>Or do you just write a little bit</p>
<p>whenever you have a moment of free time?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a boring guy, because I don&rsquo;t drink.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t, I just, I figure I can screw things up plenty</p>
<p>on my own without adding anything.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good call.</p>
<p>But, you know, for me, it either starts with a riff,</p>
<p>just something that I think is an interesting,</p>
<p>you know, riff or tone that I can kind of sink my teeth</p>
<p>into a little bit.</p>
<p>And a lot of times I&rsquo;ll write a title and love a title</p>
<p>and then start to back it up.</p>
<p>So the title is almost like an idea.</p>
<p>Yeah, like this is where I want to be</p>
<p>and then start kind of writing it out.</p>
<p>And again, I just have to know,</p>
<p>am I writing from a character&rsquo;s point of view?</p>
<p>Am I writing about someone or something,</p>
<p>you know, as like the narrator?</p>
<p>And, you know, what is this person?</p>
<p>Are they happy?</p>
<p>Are they sad?</p>
<p>Are they happy?</p>
<p>Where are they in life?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if all that, like,</p>
<p>great writers, I&rsquo;m sure, would say,</p>
<p>why don&rsquo;t you just write?</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need all that.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s, for me, that&rsquo;s my process.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m not so sure about that.</p>
<p>I bet you quite a lot of writers have</p>
<p>created a world in their mind</p>
<p>before they even put the simplest of words down.</p>
<p>So yeah, there&rsquo;s quite a lot to that.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your favorite song to play?</p>
<p>Is there some favorite ones you go to?</p>
<p>But both play and kind of, I&rsquo;m sure you love singing.</p>
<p>Oh, no, no, no.</p>
<p>No, you don&rsquo;t?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not, I&rsquo;m neither talented nor do I have the desire.</p>
<p>And I think, you know, if you come see the show,</p>
<p>you won&rsquo;t see a microphone anywhere near me.</p>
<p>But do you, I mean, do you hear,</p>
<p>like when you&rsquo;re thinking about lyrics,</p>
<p>do you hear the idea of the words?</p>
<p>100%.</p>
<p>And especially what&rsquo;s great with Trey</p>
<p>is I write for his voice.</p>
<p>And then we have these amazing backup singers</p>
<p>that are just, and I can hear all of it,</p>
<p>I just can&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;d say of our stuff,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a song called Half My Fault</p>
<p>that I play in Open G that just,</p>
<p>I love playing the song.</p>
<p>I love that energy.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s, we have a new blues album coming out</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a song called Baby We&rsquo;re Through</p>
<p>and it just stays on the one.</p>
<p>And if for non musicians, that means,</p>
<p>like in a lot of rock and roll and blues,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s called a one, four, five progression</p>
<p>from your kind of root note.</p>
<p>And you would hear, if you&rsquo;re a non musician,</p>
<p>if you heard it, you&rsquo;d be like,</p>
<p>oh yeah, that&rsquo;s a lot of songs.</p>
<p>And this song just stays on the same groove.</p>
<p>Like La Grange or Shake Your Hips or any of those songs.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just got this unbelievable energy</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s fun to play,</p>
<p>but I have to keep the same rhythmic thing going</p>
<p>for the whole song.</p>
<p>With that simplicity, I mean,</p>
<p>the personality of the song can really shine.</p>
<p>I mean, Trey&rsquo;s, I mean, that guy, really cool.</p>
<p>He just comes through.</p>
<p>I mean, I guess you need that from a lead singer.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s just, he&rsquo;s just.</p>
<p>You gotta have that, and my other guitar player,</p>
<p>Johnny Bob is, he&rsquo;s a phenomenal,</p>
<p>I mean, like a legitimate guitar slinger.</p>
<p>You know, we probably split the leads 70, 30,</p>
<p>and he is just, you know,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s times sometimes I look over at him</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m like, I&rsquo;m being a fan right now</p>
<p>because what you just laid down is pretty good.</p>
<p>From a lead perspective, what&rsquo;s the most fun thing to play?</p>
<p>What kind of stuff do you, do you like slow?</p>
<p>Do you like, I mean, if you, like, thrill is gone.</p>
<p>So if you look at B.B. King,</p>
<p>sometimes one note just bending the shit out of that.</p>
<p>What do you call that, vibrato?</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m gonna play the lead, it&rsquo;s a certain kind of feel.</p>
<p>Slow blues is probably my favorite to play,</p>
<p>or something that&rsquo;s got a little more</p>
<p>of that Chuck Berry drive</p>
<p>where you can be rhythmic in the lead.</p>
<p>You know, I can&rsquo;t, the shredding thing that those guys do</p>
<p>is, that&rsquo;s not my.</p>
<p>I was actually always able to do that really well.</p>
<p>Like, you mentioned people that pick up fast,</p>
<p>like, maybe it&rsquo;s the classical piano training.</p>
<p>I can play super fast on guitar, super technical.</p>
<p>But to me, the hardest thing and my favorite thing</p>
<p>is just, it&rsquo;s probably less to do with the guitar,</p>
<p>more living on life that&rsquo;s worth playing a guitar for.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a certain kind of emotion</p>
<p>that you can put into the notes.</p>
<p>And that has to do with bending notes well.</p>
<p>Like, bending notes is a whole other art form of,</p>
<p>I worked surprisingly a long time on Comfortably Numb.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s, so David Gilmour, there&rsquo;s a lot of bending.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re simple, they sound simple.</p>
<p>But the dynamics of them,</p>
<p>to express like a build up in the way it&rsquo;s held</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s often a vibrato at the top for a bit.</p>
<p>Just that, it&rsquo;s almost like a sigh</p>
<p>and a sigh of relief and the build up.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s an art form for him that&rsquo;s hard to get right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just playing a note, playing a note,</p>
<p>playing a note, it&rsquo;s in that like dynamic movement</p>
<p>of a note that so much can happen.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where the blues happens to.</p>
<p>Look, I&rsquo;m a huge Freddie King fan too, right?</p>
<p>And you listen to these guys and they&rsquo;re,</p>
<p>you sit there and they&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>man, you&rsquo;re playing in a small range on the neck.</p>
<p>But, you know, it&rsquo;s like, I know the notes you&rsquo;re playing</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m playing them too, but not like that, right?</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s, and Gilmour is certainly one of those guys</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s an incredible guitar player.</p>
<p>And yet another chapter of an amazing life.</p>
<p>You love football, like you mentioned.</p>
<p>You play football?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>What position do you play?</p>
<p>Wide receiver.</p>
<p>Awesome.</p>
<p>So, maybe we can talk a little bit about your love</p>
<p>of football and the fact that you are part owner</p>
<p>of the Pittsburgh Steelers.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So, I mean, where do we start?</p>
<p>You start at the beginning, let&rsquo;s start at the end.</p>
<p>Why the Steelers?</p>
<p>What attracted you to the, first of all,</p>
<p>I think not to be controversial,</p>
<p>but one of the best uniforms in football</p>
<p>in terms of just the black and gold, just.</p>
<p>Decal only on one side.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>Yeah, the helmet.</p>
<p>Look, I&rsquo;ve bled black and gold since I was a little boy.</p>
<p>I grew up in upstate New York.</p>
<p>And the first football game I ever saw</p>
<p>was the Steelers in the Super Bowl is a really little kit.</p>
<p>And it just, I mean, Jack Lambert and Joe Green</p>
<p>and Franco Harris and those guys were like,</p>
<p>came down from Olympia, Mount Olympus or something.</p>
<p>And I just was enamored with the team.</p>
<p>And because we only had three channels,</p>
<p>the only time I&rsquo;d get to see them is occasionally</p>
<p>when they were the game of the week or something.</p>
<p>And I just loved to me what they stood for, the toughness</p>
<p>and they played football the way that I thought was great.</p>
<p>I was a huge Jack Lambert fan,</p>
<p>our Hall of Fame linebacker who just intimidated everybody.</p>
<p>So that was like the,</p>
<p>that was the decade of the steel curtain.</p>
<p>I mean, arguably one of the great sort of defensive</p>
<p>in football history and also one of the greatest</p>
<p>football teams period of in football history.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been a lifelong fan and was very fortunate</p>
<p>to meet Mr. Rooney.</p>
<p>The Rooney family started the team in 1933,</p>
<p>got to know him and just was asked to be part</p>
<p>of the ownership group.</p>
<p>I think it was the end of 2007,</p>
<p>first year as part of the group in 2008,</p>
<p>we won the Super Bowl.</p>
<p>And it was like beyond surreal and just beyond surreal.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s amazing to be able to do.</p>
<p>I mean, the Rooney family is one of those most revered</p>
<p>in sports for the way they conduct themselves.</p>
<p>Mr. Rooney passed away, I think five years ago now</p>
<p>and we lost him, but was a champion, helped build the league.</p>
<p>I mean, put the league as we know it together.</p>
<p>More importantly, it was a civil rights champion</p>
<p>who created what we now call the Rooney rule</p>
<p>to make sure that we&rsquo;re being fair</p>
<p>about giving minority coaches a chance to get hired.</p>
<p>And just is one of the most kind</p>
<p>and amazing human beings I ever met.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s incredible what sport does.</p>
<p>Like to bring out the best in people,</p>
<p>to give people hope, to inspire people.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something about football</p>
<p>that has all the elements of a great sport.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the teamwork, it&rsquo;s the sort of the combat aspect of it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s the purity of it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s of like strength and power and speed</p>
<p>and all the elements of like last minute,</p>
<p>close calls required to win the game.</p>
<p>And where referee decisions, of course,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s essential for a sport can screw up the whole thing.</p>
<p>Just got all of it together.</p>
<p>I think just, I don&rsquo;t know, it gives the drama</p>
<p>and the triumphs are just beautiful.</p>
<p>Like some of my favorite memories,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s an accident</p>
<p>or this is common with people,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just with friends watching football</p>
<p>and connecting over that.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, look, it&rsquo;s an incredible game</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s nowhere to hide, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re out there on the field.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s a great game that requires</p>
<p>not only all those attributes that you said,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s incredibly complex game.</p>
<p>So if you don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re looking at</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t understand how complex</p>
<p>defenses are trying to disguise what they&rsquo;re doing,</p>
<p>offenses are trying to overcome that</p>
<p>and you can set up one play the entire game,</p>
<p>but a team that plays well together, right?</p>
<p>Knows their plays inside and out,</p>
<p>knows their assignments inside and out,</p>
<p>can overcome and beat a more physically gifted team</p>
<p>because of that aspect of working together.</p>
<p>One of the things that I always loved about sports</p>
<p>is just you&rsquo;re out there, there&rsquo;s a set of rules</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a scoreboard.</p>
<p>So at the end of that game, it says,</p>
<p>and you can make excuses about the refs</p>
<p>or this happened or that happened,</p>
<p>but at the end of the day, did you go out and compete?</p>
<p>And when you went out and were a competitor,</p>
<p>how did it work out, right?</p>
<p>And the simplicity of that and the purity of that</p>
<p>is something that I always have been drawn to.</p>
<p>What about the business of sort of owning a team</p>
<p>or putting together a team or trying to like build up a team</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to be a great team?</p>
<p>Like what are some interesting aspects</p>
<p>that people might not realize that you can carry over</p>
<p>from all the other experience you have in business?</p>
<p>I think the hardest thing about professional sports,</p>
<p>right now it&rsquo;s individuals getting paid money</p>
<p>to play a sport, which is different than,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s certainly different than amateur.</p>
<p>And the decisions that are hard</p>
<p>is when you get to know somebody</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s a player on the team</p>
<p>and either they&rsquo;re at the end of their career</p>
<p>or you need to go in a different direction</p>
<p>and that person who&rsquo;s done everything that you&rsquo;ve asked,</p>
<p>whatever the coaches have asked of that person</p>
<p>and you get close to them.</p>
<p>And then when they have to be traded,</p>
<p>released or whatever happens, it&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s sad.</p>
<p>And being able to stand back and in some ways</p>
<p>be dispassionate and not be a fan, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a, I&rsquo;m on the baseball hall of fame board</p>
<p>and one of the guys that&rsquo;s on the board of me</p>
<p>is Jerry Reinsdorf.</p>
<p>And I think it was Jerry who said,</p>
<p>if you act like a fan, you&rsquo;ll be sitting with them,</p>
<p>which I thought was kind of funny.</p>
<p>Well, I got to push back on that a little bit</p>
<p>as a, by way of a fan asking a dumb question.</p>
<p>Okay, let me just give some examples.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very common in sport.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny you said this example of like</p>
<p>certain great players going to another team</p>
<p>right at the end of their career.</p>
<p>And it always makes me sad.</p>
<p>It almost makes me want to wish</p>
<p>that he kind of retired right there from a perspective</p>
<p>of just like, do you ever, as a owner,</p>
<p>but just in that space, think about like the Steelers</p>
<p>in the full arc of human history.</p>
<p>So not like as a business.</p>
<p>I mean, okay, this question might be absurd.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have to think about it as a business.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;m a minority owner,</p>
<p>so I can think about it almost as a fan,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m sorry, go ahead.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, that&rsquo;s what I mean.</p>
<p>I suppose this is a dumb question to think of,</p>
<p>like of a business in that way, not just investment,</p>
<p>but like legacy of like what footprint</p>
<p>would you leave on this world, on this history?</p>
<p>That is one thing that I can say unequivocally,</p>
<p>and I only have the experience that I have.</p>
<p>But one of the things that I&rsquo;m so proud of</p>
<p>about the way the Steelers conduct themselves is,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s the Rooney family,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the legacy of the Rooney family,</p>
<p>is asking constantly about what&rsquo;s right for the league,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s right for the players,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the right thing to do here?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s something that I would hear Mr. Rooney say</p>
<p>all the time.</p>
<p>So I think that legacy is important</p>
<p>because ultimately the team belongs to that city, right?</p>
<p>Belongs to those fans and the owners</p>
<p>are the custodians of that.</p>
<p>So I think, and when you realize what sports teams mean</p>
<p>to the fans, the memories that it creates,</p>
<p>the bonds that it creates, it&rsquo;s a responsibility.</p>
<p>And I think that you do have to think beyond the,</p>
<p>certainly not just dollars and cents,</p>
<p>but just sports is a very big deal in our society.</p>
<p>And it has to be, I think, held to a standard</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not just, well, were we profitable this year?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, there are other businesses for that.</p>
<p>It is certainly a business.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t mean to romanticize to the point that it&rsquo;s not,</p>
<p>but to me, it&rsquo;s more than that.</p>
<p>Or at least my experience has been that it&rsquo;s more than that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a source of meaning for millions of people.</p>
<p>And you see that most, like during COVID, for example,</p>
<p>when there&rsquo;s so much desperation,</p>
<p>so many people losing their jobs,</p>
<p>so many people having to deal with the uncertainty</p>
<p>of what the future holds.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something about those sports that just unites us</p>
<p>that again, the tragedy and the triumphs of sport,</p>
<p>of united, of gathering together with your friends,</p>
<p>with family, shared experience of over like this,</p>
<p>yeah, over just team, over rooting for your team,</p>
<p>for your city ultimately.</p>
<p>And the access, again, as I alluded to,</p>
<p>we didn&rsquo;t have anything when I was growing up,</p>
<p>but I would pour through the box scores.</p>
<p>I was a huge Yankee fan and Steeler fan</p>
<p>and feeling some ownership of that, right?</p>
<p>That I could read the box score and relive what they did</p>
<p>and occasionally see them on TV</p>
<p>and feel like I was part of that celebration</p>
<p>when they won and everything.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very powerful thing.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve been exceptionally successful in a bunch of avenues</p>
<p>and a bunch of efforts.</p>
<p>What advice would you give to a young person today,</p>
<p>a high school student, a college undergraduate</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s thinking about career, maybe advice,</p>
<p>not about just career, but about how to live a life</p>
<p>they can be proud of?</p>
<p>You know, we talked earlier about intellectual honesty</p>
<p>and to me, that&rsquo;s the first step of just saying</p>
<p>to the best of your ability, who am I?</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s important to me</p>
<p>and what do I wanna do and accomplish?</p>
<p>If you can start with that</p>
<p>and develop some sort of rules based philosophical,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ll do, what I won&rsquo;t do.</p>
<p>And that way you can be flexible and pliable</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re gonna need to be,</p>
<p>but if you still have a compass that tells you,</p>
<p>hey, at least I know this is the path I&rsquo;m gonna take,</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s very important.</p>
<p>The rules you&rsquo;re referring to, the principles,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s kind of like underlying integrity.</p>
<p>So knowing what lines you don&rsquo;t cross on this path.</p>
<p>Exactly right, because if you have those absolutes,</p>
<p>there are many decisions that come into focus very quickly</p>
<p>because hey, that&rsquo;s not for me, or hey,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m willing to do whatever it takes to do X, Y, and Z.</p>
<p>And it has to do with the thing you were talking about.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of interesting, you mentioned earlier</p>
<p>in the conversation about slippery slope</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s how often it happens,</p>
<p>like how the slipping into unethical behavior happens.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a slippery slope of little adjustments,</p>
<p>you put stuff off and I found that to be,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been fortunate to not have to encounter these moments</p>
<p>very much in my life, but I still encounter them.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what integrity I think looks like,</p>
<p>is as the slippery slope is happening,</p>
<p>those little things is without drama,</p>
<p>without making a show of it,</p>
<p>making a decision that stands behind your principles</p>
<p>and just walking away.</p>
<p>Yeah, and besides the big ideas,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna change the world, I&rsquo;m gonna innovate,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna do all those other things,</p>
<p>I also start, if I&rsquo;m giving any advice,</p>
<p>which we can debate whether or not I should be giving advice,</p>
<p>but just in terms of, well, let me start with this.</p>
<p>Are you a good friend?</p>
<p>Can you be counted on?</p>
<p>Do you do what you say you&rsquo;re going to do?</p>
<p>Yeah. Right?</p>
<p>Are you accountable to what you sign up for</p>
<p>and do you hold others accountable?</p>
<p>What does all that look like?</p>
<p>And then I think it&rsquo;s being as intellectually curious</p>
<p>and well read as you can be.</p>
<p>We live in a world that is designed to distract you, right?</p>
<p>And being able to sit with your thoughts</p>
<p>or go on a walk and think deeply about something</p>
<p>and not just surface area, you text me, I text you back</p>
<p>and we decide the fate of the world</p>
<p>based on a couple of text messages or something.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t wanna lose touch, I think, with being well read</p>
<p>and understanding and standing on great thinkers shoulders</p>
<p>and learning from those works.</p>
<p>And then I also think that there&rsquo;s resiliency</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s grit.</p>
<p>And I heard someone say one time</p>
<p>that those are slightly different.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m also, I know that there are all kinds</p>
<p>of challenges in life, right?</p>
<p>That are tragic, that are unfair.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no question that&rsquo;s the world we live in.</p>
<p>But for me personally, to try as much as possible</p>
<p>not to be in the victim mindset</p>
<p>because unfair things are gonna happen.</p>
<p>And we all wanna live in an idealistic, just world.</p>
<p>That should be what we aspire to.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t seen that yet, I haven&rsquo;t experienced that yet,</p>
<p>but yet you still have to function in that world.</p>
<p>So I think that that resiliency thing is very important.</p>
<p>And then putting yourself out there, right?</p>
<p>Because if you play scared and you&rsquo;re always afraid to fail,</p>
<p>you know, this is probably a dumb way</p>
<p>to get to the end of the podcast,</p>
<p>but there are times, especially I&rsquo;m out West,</p>
<p>I love the big sky out in Montana, Idaho, places like that.</p>
<p>And when you look up at night, it&rsquo;s almost like</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never seen anything like this before</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s no light pollution, so to speak.</p>
<p>And sometimes when I look up,</p>
<p>the most daunting problems that I&rsquo;m experiencing,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, those things have been there</p>
<p>for a billion years or whatever,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll be gone and it doesn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>the most famous person on earth 200 years ago, eh.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s pretty fleeting.</p>
<p>And so make sure you have a good journey</p>
<p>and especially coming out of COVID,</p>
<p>I think telling people that you care about them</p>
<p>and maintaining and cultivating your friendships</p>
<p>and relationships and they&rsquo;re not just transactional, right?</p>
<p>And making sure that someday when you&rsquo;re laying there,</p>
<p>you can say, yeah, I was a good family member.</p>
<p>I was a good friend.</p>
<p>I was someone that could be counted on.</p>
<p>I think all those things go into the mix of, you know,</p>
<p>however you wanna take the journey.</p>
<p>So when you look up to the stars,</p>
<p>do you think about that quickly approaching end of yours?</p>
<p>Do you think about your own mortality?</p>
<p>Do you think about your death?</p>
<p>Are you afraid of your death?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a huge fan of stoicism, right?</p>
<p>I read a lot of stoicism.</p>
<p>I think Ryan Holiday&rsquo;s done a great job</p>
<p>of bringing some of that back into the forefront.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just really thought provoking to me</p>
<p>and rings, a lot of it rings, just hits me</p>
<p>and says, I think that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>And that Momento Mori thing, which is,</p>
<p>hey, we&rsquo;re all gonna die, so you should contemplate it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a finality to this thing.</p>
<p>And so I think if you can rightly frame that</p>
<p>between fretting about it every day and being afraid</p>
<p>and being so laissez faire that you think, you know,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna live forever,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll influence some of the decisions you make.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll influence the way you attack things</p>
<p>and hopefully the way that you live your life.</p>
<p>So yes, I wouldn&rsquo;t say I obsess over it</p>
<p>and I wouldn&rsquo;t say it&rsquo;s omnipresent,</p>
<p>but because I read a lot of stoicism</p>
<p>and just, I think it&rsquo;s right to pause and say,</p>
<p>who knows, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s gonna be an expiration date.</p>
<p>And if it happened tomorrow,</p>
<p>have I done the things I wanted to do?</p>
<p>And am I the person I wanted to be?</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s important along the way</p>
<p>to check those things.</p>
<p>Yeah, I try to make sure that I actually visualize this,</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m okay dying at the end of the day,</p>
<p>at the end of each day.</p>
<p>Like, if this is the last thing I do in my life</p>
<p>is talking to you.</p>
<p>Oh, good Lord.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m happy.</p>
<p>I know you&rsquo;re joking, but I, you know,</p>
<p>that, yeah, I&rsquo;m happy I get to live the life I do</p>
<p>and I think momentum more,</p>
<p>I think the stoics have it right.</p>
<p>So you, and you have it right in saying,</p>
<p>meditate on death enough to remember</p>
<p>that this ride ends pretty quickly,</p>
<p>to help you appreciate every day</p>
<p>and the people you love, the people close to you</p>
<p>and the cool shit that you&rsquo;re doing in your life,</p>
<p>the cool shit you&rsquo;re creating.</p>
<p>And the fact that you, Mr. Thomas Tall,</p>
<p>are playing with the motherfucking Rolling Stones tomorrow.</p>
<p>You are the man in so many disciplines,</p>
<p>so respected, so successful.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s truly an honor that you sit down</p>
<p>and talk with me today.</p>
<p>Thomas, thank you so much for showing up in Texas</p>
<p>and for talking on this silly little podcast.</p>
<p>Oh, it&rsquo;s great, man.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a huge fan of the show</p>
<p>and have had a great time hanging with you</p>
<p>and really appreciate it.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation with Thomas Tall.</p>
<p>To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors</p>
<p>in the description.</p>
<p>And now, let me leave you with some words</p>
<p>from Mick Jagger and the Rolling Stones.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t always get what you want,</p>
<p>but if you try sometimes,</p>
<p>you might find you&rsquo;ll get what you need.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.</p>
