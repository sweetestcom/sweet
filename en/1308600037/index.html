    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>where we discuss science</p>
<p>and science-based tools for everyday life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Andrew Huberman,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology</p>
<p>at Stanford School of Medicine.</p>
<p>Today, we are going to talk all about healthy</p>
<p>and disordered eating.</p>
<p>And indeed, we are going to talk</p>
<p>about clinical eating disorders,</p>
<p>such as anorexia, bulimia, and binge eating disorder,</p>
<p>as well as some other related eating disorders.</p>
<p>However, before we get into this material,</p>
<p>I want to emphasize that today&rsquo;s discussion</p>
<p>will include what it is to have</p>
<p>a healthy relationship with food.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to talk about metabolism.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to talk about how eating frequency</p>
<p>and what one eats influences things like appetite</p>
<p>and satiety, as well as whether or not</p>
<p>we have a healthy psychological relationship to food</p>
<p>and our body weight and so-called body composition,</p>
<p>the ratio of muscle to fat, to bone, et cetera.</p>
<p>So as we march into this conversation,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to share with you some interesting</p>
<p>and what I believe are important findings</p>
<p>in the realm of nutrition and human behavior.</p>
<p>I know these days, many people are excited about</p>
<p>or curious about so-called intermittent fasting.</p>
<p>Intermittent fasting is, as the name implies,</p>
<p>simply restricting one&rsquo;s feeding behavior, eating,</p>
<p>to a particular phase of the 24-hour</p>
<p>or so-called circadian cycle.</p>
<p>Other forms of intermittent fasting involve</p>
<p>not eating for extended periods of time,</p>
<p>for entire days, or some people will extend</p>
<p>to two days or three days, typically,</p>
<p>and hopefully they will drink water during those times,</p>
<p>sometimes referred to as water fasting,</p>
<p>which means that they are ingesting fluids,</p>
<p>and hopefully they are ingesting electrolytes</p>
<p>such as salt, potassium, and magnesium as well,</p>
<p>because while one can survive for some period of time</p>
<p>without ingesting calories, it is extremely important</p>
<p>to continue to ingest plenty of fluids and electrolytes,</p>
<p>and the reason for that is that the neurons</p>
<p>of your brain and body that control your movements,</p>
<p>your thoughts, clarity of thinking in general, et cetera,</p>
<p>is critically dependent on the presence</p>
<p>of adequate levels of sodium, potassium, and magnesium,</p>
<p>the electrolytes, and that&rsquo;s because neurons</p>
<p>can only be electrically active by way of movement</p>
<p>of particular ions, which include things like sodium,</p>
<p>potassium, and magnesium, so without those,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t think, you can&rsquo;t function,</p>
<p>and it actually can be quite dangerous.</p>
<p>So why all the excitement about intermittent fasting?</p>
<p>Well, a lot of the excitement relates to work</p>
<p>that was done by a former colleague of mine</p>
<p>down at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies</p>
<p>in San Diego named Sachin Panda.</p>
<p>Sachin&rsquo;s lab identified some very important</p>
<p>and impactful health benefits of restricting</p>
<p>one&rsquo;s feeding window to particular times</p>
<p>within the 24-hour cycle, or even to having extended fasts</p>
<p>that go for a day or two days or maybe even three days.</p>
<p>What they saw was an improvement in liver enzymes,</p>
<p>an improvement in insulin sensitivity,</p>
<p>which is something that is good.</p>
<p>It means that you can utilize the calories</p>
<p>and the blood sugar that you happen to have.</p>
<p>Being insulin insensitive is not good</p>
<p>and is actually a form of diabetes.</p>
<p>What Sachin&rsquo;s lab and subsequently other labs showed</p>
<p>was that restricting one&rsquo;s feeding window</p>
<p>to anywhere from four to eight or even 12 hours</p>
<p>during each 24-hour cycle was beneficial in mice,</p>
<p>and some studies in humans have also shown</p>
<p>that it can be beneficial for various health parameters.</p>
<p>However, the excitement about intermittent fasting</p>
<p>seems to be related to the foundational truth</p>
<p>about metabolism and weight loss and weight maintenance</p>
<p>and weight gain, which is that regardless</p>
<p>of whether or not you intermittent fast</p>
<p>or whether or not you eat small meals all day long</p>
<p>or you eat one meal in the evening and snack up until then,</p>
<p>it really doesn&rsquo;t matter in the sense</p>
<p>that the calories that you ingest from whatever source</p>
<p>are going to be filtered through the calories that you burn</p>
<p>by way of exercise, basal metabolic rate,</p>
<p>which is just the calories that you happen to burn,</p>
<p>just being alive and thinking and breathing</p>
<p>and your heart beating, et cetera.</p>
<p>And the reason why many people prefer intermittent fasting</p>
<p>to other forms of, let&rsquo;s just call it what it is,</p>
<p>diet or nutritional framework is that many people</p>
<p>find it easier to not eat than to limit their portion size.</p>
<p>And here I&rsquo;m not talking necessarily about eating disorders,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking about the general population.</p>
<p>So I think that&rsquo;s one reason why there&rsquo;s so much excitement</p>
<p>about intermittent fasting.</p>
<p>Now, within the context of intermittent fasting</p>
<p>on a circadian timescale, once every 24 hours,</p>
<p>you generally find two categories of people,</p>
<p>people who prefer to not eat in the morning,</p>
<p>either because they are not hungry in the morning</p>
<p>or because they find it relatively straightforward</p>
<p>to just drink things like coffee or water, et cetera,</p>
<p>and push their feeding window out to noon or 2 p.m.</p>
<p>or 3 p.m. and then they&rsquo;ll eat between say 1 p.m.</p>
<p>and 8 p.m. or 9 p.m., it depends on the individual.</p>
<p>Other groups of people find that they are very hungry</p>
<p>when they wake up in the morning,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t feel well if they don&rsquo;t eat breakfast.</p>
<p>And so they prefer to eat early in the day,</p>
<p>but then they limit their feeding window</p>
<p>such that they cut off their food intake</p>
<p>or stop ingesting any calories of any kind</p>
<p>somewhere around 5 p.m. or 6 p.m., et cetera.</p>
<p>So the duration of the feeding window</p>
<p>has not been broken down</p>
<p>into the kind of nuanced type of information</p>
<p>that one would really want,</p>
<p>at least not in human studies,</p>
<p>saying, well, a six-hour feeding window</p>
<p>or an eight-hour feeding window is ideal.</p>
<p>It really is going to vary</p>
<p>based on lifestyle and circumstances.</p>
<p>For instance, some families</p>
<p>really want to eat dinner together every night.</p>
<p>So do you want to be the person</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s sitting there watching everybody eat</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re fasting from 5 p.m. onward?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, that&rsquo;s an individual difference.</p>
<p>What you can start to identify, however,</p>
<p>is that people tend to fall</p>
<p>into either one category or the other,</p>
<p>people who prefer to skip eating in the morning</p>
<p>or people that prefer to</p>
<p>or manage to skip eating in the evening.</p>
<p>And there has been no evidence thus far</p>
<p>that one is better or worse,</p>
<p>at least in terms of weight loss</p>
<p>or overall health parameters.</p>
<p>Now, you can imagine that some people</p>
<p>might eat breakfast and dinner.</p>
<p>And indeed, I have several, many colleagues, in fact,</p>
<p>who just choose to skip lunch</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re busy during the day.</p>
<p>They eat breakfast and dinner.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t afford the long fast associated with sleep.</p>
<p>What do I mean by that?</p>
<p>Well, if you went to sleep at 11 p.m.</p>
<p>and you wake up at 6 a.m.</p>
<p>by extending your fast until 1 p.m. in the afternoon,</p>
<p>you get quite a long period of no ingesting any calories.</p>
<p>Whereas when you don&rsquo;t eat during the middle of the day,</p>
<p>you are getting a fasting period</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s probably anywhere from four to seven hours,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not linked to the longer fasting period</p>
<p>of not eating while you are asleep.</p>
<p>Because most all people, and I want to emphasize most,</p>
<p>do not eat while they are asleep.</p>
<p>But we are going to talk about an eating disorder</p>
<p>that does exist where people actually eat in their sleep.</p>
<p>I know it sounds pretty wild,</p>
<p>but indeed that eating disorder does exist</p>
<p>and has a very interesting underlying mechanism.</p>
<p>So why are we talking about this?</p>
<p>And in particular, why are we talking about this</p>
<p>during an episode that includes a discussion</p>
<p>about eating disorders?</p>
<p>The reason is nobody, not the government,</p>
<p>no nutritionists, no individual,</p>
<p>no matter how knowledgeable they are about food</p>
<p>and nutrition and food intake,</p>
<p>can define the best plan for eating for any one individual.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to repeat that.</p>
<p>Nobody knows what truly healthy eating is.</p>
<p>We only know the measurements we can take,</p>
<p>liver enzymes, blood lipid profiles, body weight,</p>
<p>athletic performance, mental performance,</p>
<p>whether or not you&rsquo;re cranky all day,</p>
<p>whether or not you&rsquo;re feeling relaxed.</p>
<p>Nobody knows how to define these,</p>
<p>and these have strong cultural and familial</p>
<p>and socio-societal influence.</p>
<p>So if you hang out with people</p>
<p>that intermittent fast all day,</p>
<p>that will seem normal.</p>
<p>If you spend time with people</p>
<p>that have never heard of intermittent fasting,</p>
<p>intermittent fasting is going to seem very abnormal.</p>
<p>Now, we are going to talk about eating disorders</p>
<p>that really fall into the category</p>
<p>of clinically diagnosable eating disorders</p>
<p>for which there&rsquo;s actually serious health hazards</p>
<p>and even the serious risk of death.</p>
<p>We will get to that topic.</p>
<p>But for the time being,</p>
<p>I want to emphasize a new set of findings</p>
<p>that I think many people will find interesting</p>
<p>and at least will want to consider</p>
<p>in light of their current nutritional plan</p>
<p>or pattern of eating,</p>
<p>whether or not you&rsquo;re intermittent fasting or not.</p>
<p>And I want to cue up an important framework</p>
<p>for the rest of the conversation</p>
<p>on healthy and disordered eating,</p>
<p>which includes an understanding of thinking,</p>
<p>decision-making, and what we call homeostatic processes,</p>
<p>meaning regulation of things</p>
<p>that are going on in our brain and body,</p>
<p>and reward mechanisms.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to return to that in a moment.</p>
<p>But first I want to share with you these new findings</p>
<p>that were just published in the journal Cell Reports,</p>
<p>a cell press journal, excellent journal.</p>
<p>This was a study that was performed both in mice</p>
<p>and it included a crossover study with a human population.</p>
<p>The human population was women,</p>
<p>but it relates to a previous study</p>
<p>that was also carried out in men.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to simplify this study.</p>
<p>We will provide a link to the full study</p>
<p>so you can explore it in more detail.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re really excited about the results,</p>
<p>I would encourage you to explore some of the references</p>
<p>within that paper as well.</p>
<p>What was the study?</p>
<p>The study looked at giving mice or humans two meals</p>
<p>and explored whether or not putting those meals</p>
<p>early in the day or late in the day</p>
<p>had an impact on muscle hypertrophy, muscle growth,</p>
<p>and overall protein synthesis of muscle.</p>
<p>So when we eat, the amino acids from various foods</p>
<p>are broken down and synthesized</p>
<p>into different types of tissues.</p>
<p>They can be utilized for energy,</p>
<p>burned up for moving about and thinking, et cetera,</p>
<p>or it can be synthesized,</p>
<p>those amino acids can be synthesized into skeletal muscle,</p>
<p>the sorts of skeletal muscles</p>
<p>that allow you to move your limbs.</p>
<p>This study explored how protein intake,</p>
<p>which included what are called branch chain amino acids</p>
<p>and amino acids like leucine,</p>
<p>which are important for muscle protein synthesis,</p>
<p>it explored whether or not emphasizing or skewing</p>
<p>the protein intake toward early day or late day</p>
<p>was better in terms of muscle hypertrophy.</p>
<p>And they also looked at some parameters of strength</p>
<p>like grip strength.</p>
<p>Now, mice are nocturnal.</p>
<p>So before you say, wait, mice are nocturnal.</p>
<p>How did they look during the day?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s completely, it doesn&rsquo;t apply because it&rsquo;s in mice.</p>
<p>Of course they knew that.</p>
<p>And they looked during the mice&rsquo;s active phase</p>
<p>of their circadian cycle, which corresponds to our day.</p>
<p>And in humans, they looked at whether or not eating</p>
<p>most of one&rsquo;s protein early in the day</p>
<p>was better than if the protein intake</p>
<p>and these branch chain amino acids</p>
<p>were placed later in the day.</p>
<p>And yes, they had the mice do resistance training.</p>
<p>They did that by emphasizing overload</p>
<p>to one limb of the mouse.</p>
<p>And that actually generates hypertrophy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a form of resistance training in mice.</p>
<p>So they don&rsquo;t have the weight training.</p>
<p>They weren&rsquo;t doing curls and dips and squats</p>
<p>and things of that sort.</p>
<p>They were moving their own body weight,</p>
<p>but they skewed that distribution of body weight</p>
<p>by restricting a limb and forcing them to use one limb</p>
<p>that did indeed grow in response to that.</p>
<p>And then in humans,</p>
<p>there was an exploration of grip strength.</p>
<p>And then with resistance training,</p>
<p>that was also carried out through a peripheral study.</p>
<p>Basically the takeaway from this study</p>
<p>was that mice and humans can utilize amino acids</p>
<p>that are ingested early in the day</p>
<p>better than they can utilize amino acids</p>
<p>ingested later in the day,</p>
<p>in particular toward muscle hypertrophy and growth</p>
<p>or maintenance of muscle,</p>
<p>which for those of you that aren&rsquo;t interested</p>
<p>in muscle hypertrophy,</p>
<p>that aren&rsquo;t trying to grow your muscles,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked before in the episode</p>
<p>on building strength and hypertrophy,</p>
<p>that maintaining muscle,</p>
<p>regardless of one&rsquo;s athletic prowess,</p>
<p>regardless of one&rsquo;s age is extremely important</p>
<p>because loss of skeletal muscle</p>
<p>is one of the major causes of injury as we age.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of the major causes, believe it or not,</p>
<p>of cognitive and metabolic deficits as we age.</p>
<p>So maintaining muscle is important.</p>
<p>Building muscle might be important to some of you,</p>
<p>but what they found was ingesting protein early in the day</p>
<p>and these amino acids early in the day</p>
<p>led to more muscle hypertrophy</p>
<p>than if the majority of amino acids and proteins</p>
<p>were ingested late in the day.</p>
<p>So this translates to intermittent fasting</p>
<p>such that if you are interested in muscle hypertrophy,</p>
<p>you might, and I want to emphasize might,</p>
<p>consider making sure that you&rsquo;re getting</p>
<p>sufficient protein intake early in the day.</p>
<p>What sources of protein you use</p>
<p>is going to be highly individual.</p>
<p>Some of you are meat eaters.</p>
<p>Some of you don&rsquo;t eat red meat.</p>
<p>Some of you eat chicken and fish and eggs.</p>
<p>Some of you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Some of you are vegans.</p>
<p>It has been shown that the amino acid leucine</p>
<p>is vital for the cell growth process,</p>
<p>including muscle growth because of its relationship</p>
<p>to the so-called mTOR pathway,</p>
<p>mammalian target of rapamycin.</p>
<p>We can talk about that more if you like in a future episode.</p>
<p>This means that if you&rsquo;re somebody who wants to maintain</p>
<p>or increase the amount of muscle mass that you have,</p>
<p>ingesting a high protein meal early in the day</p>
<p>ought to be beneficial for that.</p>
<p>Does it mean that you should not eat protein</p>
<p>in the afternoon and evening?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>I think a lot of people might&rsquo;ve misinterpreted this study</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t want that to happen.</p>
<p>This is only pointing out the fact that ingesting</p>
<p>sufficient quality amino acids, including leucine,</p>
<p>early in the day can be beneficial for maintenance</p>
<p>and growth of muscle tissue.</p>
<p>It does not say that you should avoid protein</p>
<p>later in the day.</p>
<p>Now, for you intermittent fasters, this could be relevant.</p>
<p>I, for instance, was somebody who for a very long time</p>
<p>skipped breakfast.</p>
<p>My first meal of the day would be in the early afternoon,</p>
<p>mostly protein and salad.</p>
<p>In my case, animal protein,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s in alignment with my values.</p>
<p>Then in the evening I would eat pasta, vegetables, et cetera.</p>
<p>I might have some protein, some small piece of fish</p>
<p>or chicken or something like that,</p>
<p>but I didn&rsquo;t really emphasize that.</p>
<p>On the basis of these results, I am experimenting with,</p>
<p>I want to emphasize experimenting with.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t completely tossed out my old protocol,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m experimenting with eating proteins early in the day</p>
<p>and eating lunch.</p>
<p>And then dinner might be a light supper of some sort,</p>
<p>but not so much protein later in the evening.</p>
<p>Again, if you want to eat six meals a day,</p>
<p>you want to eat around the clock.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to stop you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not telling anybody what to do.</p>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, nobody knows exactly how to eat</p>
<p>for one&rsquo;s particular goals.</p>
<p>But this study was really interesting</p>
<p>because it really did show that we can utilize the proteins</p>
<p>that are ingested early in the day better</p>
<p>than we can utilize the proteins that are ingested</p>
<p>later in the day.</p>
<p>And of course there will be factors that can shift that.</p>
<p>For instance, if you work out very hard</p>
<p>with resistance training later in the day,</p>
<p>resistance training is known to increase protein synthesis.</p>
<p>So it stands to reason that ingesting amino acids</p>
<p>after that training would be beneficial.</p>
<p>However, in this study, it did not seem to matter</p>
<p>when the resistance training fell</p>
<p>within the 24 hour schedule.</p>
<p>The morning ingestion or early day ingestion</p>
<p>of amino acids seem to be beneficial.</p>
<p>How early?</p>
<p>Between the hours of about 5 a.m. and 10 a.m. for humans.</p>
<p>Now, just a bit of mechanism to explain why this happens.</p>
<p>So why would it be that ingesting protein early in the day</p>
<p>would lead to more synthesis of muscle</p>
<p>than ingesting protein later in the day?</p>
<p>And the reason it turns out is related</p>
<p>to the circadian clock mechanism that is present</p>
<p>in all cells, including muscle cells.</p>
<p>So muscles have fibers.</p>
<p>I think most people are aware of that,</p>
<p>that your muscles are not just one big blob of tissue.</p>
<p>A lot of these little fibers that contract.</p>
<p>Within those fibers, however, there are cells with nuclei.</p>
<p>Those nuclei contain DNA.</p>
<p>DNA is transcribed into RNA.</p>
<p>RNA is translated into proteins.</p>
<p>The DNA of your cells, including these muscle cells,</p>
<p>are under strong circadian regulation.</p>
<p>Each one has a pattern of gene expression</p>
<p>that is different at different times</p>
<p>during the 24 hour cycle.</p>
<p>This is an unescapable reality of all cells in your body,</p>
<p>right from your hair cells, to your brain cells,</p>
<p>to your retinal cells, to your toe on both feet.</p>
<p>These cells make a gene called BMAL, B-M-A-L,</p>
<p>is a clock gene.</p>
<p>And the expression of this clock gene</p>
<p>varies across the 24 hour cycle.</p>
<p>And proteins that are downstream of this BMAL gene</p>
<p>influence protein synthesis.</p>
<p>The circadian regulation of this BMAL gene</p>
<p>turns out to be vitally important</p>
<p>for this protein synthesis mechanism.</p>
<p>How do we know that?</p>
<p>Well, in this particular study,</p>
<p>because they had a mouse that lacked BMAL,</p>
<p>the gene was knocked out.</p>
<p>They had a bunch of these mice.</p>
<p>They were able to explore</p>
<p>whether or not this early day feeding effect</p>
<p>was present or absent in these mice</p>
<p>that lack the gene BMAL.</p>
<p>And indeed it was absent.</p>
<p>In other words, the effect of increased protein synthesis</p>
<p>early in the day was eliminated</p>
<p>in the absence of the BMAL gene.</p>
<p>So what this means is that when you wake up in the morning,</p>
<p>assuming you&rsquo;re following a standard schedule</p>
<p>of being asleep at night and awake during the day,</p>
<p>your muscle cells are primed to incorporate amino acids</p>
<p>and synthesize muscle,</p>
<p>regardless of whether or not you weight trained</p>
<p>the night before at 8 p.m.</p>
<p>or you don&rsquo;t weight train at all,</p>
<p>or you weight train afterwards or before.</p>
<p>I said 5 to 10 p.m. is the sort of critical window</p>
<p>for this increased protein synthesis.</p>
<p>All this means is that if you are interested</p>
<p>in maintaining or enhancing muscle tissue volume,</p>
<p>that you might want to consider eating quality protein</p>
<p>and amino acids early in the day.</p>
<p>You could train first, you could train after,</p>
<p>you could not train at all.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an entirely different discussion.</p>
<p>What is quality protein?</p>
<p>Well, quality protein is going to be a protein</p>
<p>that includes most of the essential amino acids</p>
<p>and in particular leucine.</p>
<p>Now, there&rsquo;s a lot of debate as to whether or not</p>
<p>you can get all the essential amino acids</p>
<p>from a purely plant-based diet</p>
<p>or whether or not you need to ingest</p>
<p>animal-based foods or not.</p>
<p>The term quality protein</p>
<p>has no strict scientific definition.</p>
<p>Some people define quality protein</p>
<p>as a protein that has a high essential amino acid</p>
<p>to caloric ratio.</p>
<p>Now, what that means is a small piece of chicken or steak</p>
<p>or eggs, for instance, will have many essential amino acids</p>
<p>with a low caloric content relative to, say,</p>
<p>beans or plant-based foods</p>
<p>that can also get you essential amino acids,</p>
<p>but it requires more calories</p>
<p>to access those essential amino acids.</p>
<p>Now, that&rsquo;s a debate that has many exceptions and nuances.</p>
<p>And I, for one, am perfectly respectful of the folks</p>
<p>that just want to ingest plant-based foods</p>
<p>in order to get their high-quality protein.</p>
<p>I think that actually can be done.</p>
<p>One has to be careful and thoughtful in their choices</p>
<p>about how to do that.</p>
<p>So this really isn&rsquo;t about animal-based</p>
<p>versus non-animal-based foods.</p>
<p>This is about getting quality amino acids early in the day</p>
<p>from whatever foods are in alignment</p>
<p>with your particular values and your particular eating plan.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a lot of information,</p>
<p>but the key takeaways are every cell in your muscles</p>
<p>has a clock gene.</p>
<p>The clock genes vary such that protein synthesis</p>
<p>is greater early in the day than it is later in the day,</p>
<p>such that in both mice and in humans,</p>
<p>ingestion of quality proteins early in the day</p>
<p>will be more so incorporated into muscle</p>
<p>than the proteins that are ingested late in the day.</p>
<p>And of course, there are the caveats of</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re training hard late in the day,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re adjusting your hormone status</p>
<p>through whatever mechanism, et cetera,</p>
<p>protein synthesis can also be high later in the day,</p>
<p>but for most people, it&rsquo;s going to taper off</p>
<p>due to this circadian B-mal gene related mechanism.</p>
<p>Again, we will provide a link to the study.</p>
<p>And the other key takeaways were that nobody knows,</p>
<p>nobody can tell you what healthy feeding windows are,</p>
<p>what the best feeding windows are.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s absolutely no information in that context.</p>
<p>You talk to 10 nutritionists or academics or trainers</p>
<p>or individuals about what healthy eating is,</p>
<p>and you are going to get vastly different answers.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s one of the reasons why I believe that</p>
<p>the internet in particular social media</p>
<p>are so filled with contradictory opinions,</p>
<p>but the calories in versus calories burned formula</p>
<p>is the more or less holy foundation</p>
<p>of all things about nutrition, eating and weight.</p>
<p>And as we transition today into the discussion</p>
<p>about eating disorders, I&rsquo;d like you to keep this in mind</p>
<p>because for the treatment of eating disorders,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t matter what psychological</p>
<p>or early trauma-based effects led to the eating disorder</p>
<p>if the person isn&rsquo;t adjusting their feeding behavior</p>
<p>in a way that is going to ameliorate</p>
<p>the symptoms of that disorder,</p>
<p>which is ultimately the goal.</p>
<p>Before we begin, I&rsquo;d like to emphasize that this podcast</p>
<p>is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.</p>
<p>It is however, part of my desire and effort</p>
<p>to bring zero cost to consumer information about science</p>
<p>and science related tools to the general public.</p>
<p>In keeping with that theme,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank the sponsors of today&rsquo;s podcast.</p>
<p>Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens.</p>
<p>Athletic Greens is an all-in-one</p>
<p>vitamin mineral probiotic drink.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been taking Athletic Greens since 2012.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m delighted that they&rsquo;re sponsoring the podcast.</p>
<p>The reason I started taking Athletic Greens</p>
<p>and the reason I still take Athletic Greens</p>
<p>once or twice a day is that it helps me cover</p>
<p>all of my basic nutritional needs.</p>
<p>It makes up for any deficiencies that I might have.</p>
<p>In addition, it has probiotics,</p>
<p>which are vital for microbiome health.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done a couple of episodes now</p>
<p>on the so-called gut microbiome</p>
<p>and the ways in which the microbiome interacts</p>
<p>with your immune system, with your brain to regulate mood,</p>
<p>and essentially with every biological system</p>
<p>relevant to health throughout your brain and body.</p>
<p>With Athletic Greens, I get the vitamins I need,</p>
<p>the minerals I need,</p>
<p>and the probiotics to support my microbiome.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Athletic Greens,</p>
<p>you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>and claim a special offer.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll give you five free travel packs</p>
<p>plus a year supply of vitamin D3 K2.</p>
<p>There are a ton of data now showing that vitamin D3</p>
<p>is essential for various aspects of our brain</p>
<p>and body health, even if we&rsquo;re getting a lot of sunshine.</p>
<p>Many of us are still deficient in vitamin D3</p>
<p>and K2 is also important because it regulates things</p>
<p>like cardiovascular function, calcium in the body, and so on.</p>
<p>Again, go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>to claim the special offer of the five free travel packs</p>
<p>and the year supply of vitamin D3 K2.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Element.</p>
<p>Element is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need</p>
<p>and nothing you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>That means the exact ratios of electrolytes are an element,</p>
<p>and those are sodium, magnesium, and potassium,</p>
<p>but it has no sugar.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked many times before on this podcast</p>
<p>about the key role of hydration and electrolytes</p>
<p>for nerve cell function, neuron function,</p>
<p>as well as the function of all the cells</p>
<p>and all the tissues and organ systems of the body.</p>
<p>If we have sodium, magnesium, and potassium</p>
<p>present in the proper ratios,</p>
<p>all of those cells function properly</p>
<p>and all our bodily systems can be optimized.</p>
<p>If the electrolytes are not present</p>
<p>and if hydration is low,</p>
<p>we simply can&rsquo;t think as well as we would otherwise,</p>
<p>our mood is off, hormone systems go off,</p>
<p>our ability to get into physical action,</p>
<p>to engage in endurance and strength</p>
<p>and all sorts of other things is diminished.</p>
<p>So with Element, you can make sure</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re staying on top of your hydration</p>
<p>and that you&rsquo;re getting the proper ratios of electrolytes.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Element,</p>
<p>you can go to drinkelement, that&rsquo;s lmnt.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll get a free Element sample pack</p>
<p>with your purchase.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all delicious.</p>
<p>So again, if you want to try Element,</p>
<p>you can go to elementlmnt.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Thesis.</p>
<p>Thesis makes what are called nootropics,</p>
<p>which means smart drugs.</p>
<p>Now, to be honest, I am not a fan of the term nootropics.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe in smart drugs in the sense that</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe that there&rsquo;s any one substance</p>
<p>or collection of substances that can make us smarter.</p>
<p>I do believe based on science, however,</p>
<p>that there are particular neural circuits</p>
<p>and brain functions that allow us to be more focused,</p>
<p>more alert, access creativity, be more motivated, et cetera.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just the way that the brain works.</p>
<p>Different neural circuits for different brain states.</p>
<p>Thesis understands this.</p>
<p>And as far as I know, they&rsquo;re the first nootropics company</p>
<p>to create targeted nootropics for specific outcomes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Thesis for more than six months now,</p>
<p>and I can confidently say that their nootropics</p>
<p>have been a total game changer.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m pleased to announce that the Huberman Lab Podcast</p>
<p>is now partnered with Momentus Supplements.</p>
<p>We partnered with Momentus for several important reasons.</p>
<p>First of all, they ship internationally</p>
<p>because we know that many of you are located</p>
<p>outside of the United States.</p>
<p>Second of all, and perhaps most important,</p>
<p>the quality of their supplements is second to none,</p>
<p>both in terms of purity and precision</p>
<p>of the amounts of the ingredients.</p>
<p>Third, we&rsquo;ve really emphasized supplements</p>
<p>that are single ingredient supplements</p>
<p>and that are supplied in dosages</p>
<p>that allow you to build a supplementation protocol</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for cost,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for effectiveness,</p>
<p>and that you can add things and remove things</p>
<p>from your protocol in a way that&rsquo;s really systematic</p>
<p>and scientific.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to see the supplements</p>
<p>that we partner with Momentus on,</p>
<p>you can go to livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>There you&rsquo;ll see those supplements,</p>
<p>and just keep in mind that we are constantly expanding</p>
<p>the library of supplements available through Momentus</p>
<p>on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about eating disorders.</p>
<p>And as we do that, I want to emphasize again</p>
<p>that nobody can really define what healthy eating is</p>
<p>with a single protocol.</p>
<p>However, there is some general agreement</p>
<p>about what unhealthy and disordered eating is.</p>
<p>There are clear criteria in the psychiatric</p>
<p>and psychological communities to define things</p>
<p>like anorexia, bulimia, binge eating disorder,</p>
<p>all of which we will talk about.</p>
<p>But as we have that discussion,</p>
<p>I want to emphasize that self-diagnosis</p>
<p>can be both a terrific, but also a very precarious thing.</p>
<p>We talked about this a little bit</p>
<p>in the episode about depression.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s always a temptation as one learns</p>
<p>about the symptomology of a given disorder,</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t really matter what the disorder is,</p>
<p>to ask the question, well, do I have that?</p>
<p>Does so-and-so that I know have that?</p>
<p>Ah, I see this sort of behavior or that pattern of thinking</p>
<p>in that individual.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s tempting to diagnose them and or ourselves</p>
<p>as either having or not having a particular disorder.</p>
<p>However, diagnoses really need to be carried out</p>
<p>by people who are trained in that particular field</p>
<p>and that have deep expertise in recognizing</p>
<p>the symptomology, including some of the more subtle</p>
<p>symptomology of eating disorders.</p>
<p>So if any of the symptoms resonate with you</p>
<p>by way of you thinking that you have this particular</p>
<p>disorder or someone that you know has a disorder,</p>
<p>I would take that seriously,</p>
<p>but I would take that information</p>
<p>to a qualified healthcare professional</p>
<p>that could diagnose or rule out</p>
<p>any of these possible disorders.</p>
<p>I say that not to protect us, but to protect you,</p>
<p>because information is valuable.</p>
<p>And I do believe that knowledge of knowledge</p>
<p>can be very valuable in navigating any topic</p>
<p>and improving our thoughts and behaviors around that topic.</p>
<p>But one doesn&rsquo;t want to, or I should say,</p>
<p>one shouldn&rsquo;t start to self-diagnose</p>
<p>simply on the basis of information</p>
<p>without running that through the filter</p>
<p>of a qualified professional.</p>
<p>So what is an eating disorder?</p>
<p>Well, we have to take a step back and confess to the fact</p>
<p>that every society, every culture, every family,</p>
<p>and every individual has a different relationship to food.</p>
<p>Eating disorders, however, have particular criteria</p>
<p>that allow us to define them</p>
<p>and to think about different modes of treatment</p>
<p>as it relates to the particular symptoms,</p>
<p>in particular, the psychological and biological symptoms</p>
<p>of those disorders.</p>
<p>Now that&rsquo;s a mouthful, no pun intended.</p>
<p>What are the major eating disorders?</p>
<p>Anorexia nervosa, most commonly referred to as anorexia,</p>
<p>is perhaps the most prevalent</p>
<p>and the most dangerous of all eating disorders.</p>
<p>In fact, anorexia is the most dangerous</p>
<p>psychiatric disorder of all, even more than depression.</p>
<p>The probability of death for untreated anorexia is very high.</p>
<p>And sadly, the prevalence of anorexia is very high.</p>
<p>So what is anorexia and how prevalent is it?</p>
<p>Anorexia, if you look it up online</p>
<p>or you talk to a qualified professional,</p>
<p>is essentially a failure to eat enough</p>
<p>to maintain a healthy weight.</p>
<p>You can see all sorts of very troubling symptoms</p>
<p>of somebody who&rsquo;s been anorexic for some period of time,</p>
<p>a general loss of muscle mass</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re ingesting fewer calories than they burn.</p>
<p>Muscle is very metabolically active.</p>
<p>They tend to lose a lot of muscle mass.</p>
<p>They will have a low heart rate.</p>
<p>This is the body and brain&rsquo;s attempt</p>
<p>to lower energy output.</p>
<p>They will have low blood pressure.</p>
<p>They will sometimes have symptoms like fainting.</p>
<p>They will have sometimes even hair growth on the face,</p>
<p>something called lanugo,</p>
<p>which is essentially the body&rsquo;s attempt</p>
<p>to insulate the body because of loss of body heat</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re that thin.</p>
<p>Loss of bone density, osteoporosis,</p>
<p>loss of periods in girls and women,</p>
<p>and all sorts of disrupted gut and immune functions.</p>
<p>So there are just tons of terrible symptoms of anorexia</p>
<p>that really place the anorexic into a very risky state,</p>
<p>which is why mortality from anorexia gone untreated</p>
<p>is extremely high.</p>
<p>Now, one of the misconceptions about anorexia</p>
<p>is that it stems from an overemphasis on perfectionism</p>
<p>or that because of all the images in social media</p>
<p>and in advertising of extremely thin and fit</p>
<p>or muscular people,</p>
<p>that individuals are looking at themselves</p>
<p>and comparing themselves to those images</p>
<p>and thinking that they don&rsquo;t match up</p>
<p>and developing anorexia.</p>
<p>That turns out to not be the case.</p>
<p>If you look at the prevalence or the rates of anorexia</p>
<p>in the last 10 years or 20 years,</p>
<p>and you compare that to when anorexia was first identified,</p>
<p>which was in the 1600s and perhaps even earlier,</p>
<p>what you find is that rates of anorexia are not going up.</p>
<p>So this idea that the images that we&rsquo;re being bombarded with</p>
<p>are causing anorexia doesn&rsquo;t seem to be true.</p>
<p>Now, that is not to say that the images</p>
<p>that we in particular young people are being bombarded with</p>
<p>are healthy for their psychological state of mind,</p>
<p>but classically defined anorexia</p>
<p>has existed at essentially the same prevalence</p>
<p>for the last 100, 200, 300, and 400 years,</p>
<p>which is incredible and really speaks to the likelihood</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a strong biological contribution</p>
<p>to what we call anorexia nervosa.</p>
<p>Anorexia nervosa is extremely common.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s anywhere from one to 2% of women.</p>
<p>And the typical onset is in adolescence, close to puberty,</p>
<p>but it can show up later in life as well.</p>
<p>In fact, the identification and diagnosis of anorexia</p>
<p>tends to be in the early twenties.</p>
<p>But if you look back at the history of those individuals,</p>
<p>there were typically signs of anorexia</p>
<p>that stem back into their early teens,</p>
<p>or maybe even before that.</p>
<p>Now, of course, men can be anorexic as well,</p>
<p>but anorexia nervosa does seem to occur</p>
<p>at 10 times the rate in women and young girls</p>
<p>than it does in men and young boys.</p>
<p>So while there does seem to be more of a prevalence</p>
<p>of anorexia in boys and young men these days,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s probably due to better diagnosis and detection</p>
<p>than it is to some sort of societal shift</p>
<p>related to imagery, et cetera.</p>
<p>Later, we will talk about body dysmorphia</p>
<p>and some of the images that are present in media</p>
<p>and social media and how those are impacting</p>
<p>other forms of eating disorders.</p>
<p>But when you look at anorexia nervosa,</p>
<p>this failure to maintain weight, even to healthy levels,</p>
<p>and often drops in weight that are very dangerous</p>
<p>or even deadly, that has existed for a very long time</p>
<p>and seems to be somewhat hardwired</p>
<p>into the biology of individuals that suffer from it.</p>
<p>Now, when I say hardwired,</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t mean that it can&rsquo;t be treated or cured,</p>
<p>and indeed it can.</p>
<p>Bulimia, which is defined as binge eating or overeating.</p>
<p>Let me explain what that is.</p>
<p>Binge eating is consuming vast amounts of calories</p>
<p>in a short period of time.</p>
<p>Overeating can be ingesting more calories than one needs,</p>
<p>but over an extended period of time.</p>
<p>Both can exist, of course, but bulimia is also very common.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more common in young girls and in women</p>
<p>than it is in young boys and in men,</p>
<p>but it is present in both sexes.</p>
<p>Bulimia and rates of bulimia might be increasing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s sort of an interesting finding.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not quite clear whether or not it&rsquo;s existed</p>
<p>in its same form for a long period of time</p>
<p>or whether or not there are new forms</p>
<p>that are evolving or showing up.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to drill into bulimia</p>
<p>and what it actually is and what it represents.</p>
<p>But one thing I want to be clear about,</p>
<p>just as the perfectionist mindset</p>
<p>has been associated with anorexia,</p>
<p>and it turns out that&rsquo;s not the case.</p>
<p>It can be, but it&rsquo;s not always associated with anorexia.</p>
<p>There was the idea that bulimia is associated</p>
<p>with early trauma in childhood, in particular sexual trauma.</p>
<p>And while that can be the case,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no direct correlation between the two.</p>
<p>Now, obviously, psychological phenomena and trauma</p>
<p>can have a profound impact</p>
<p>on the way that the brain wires up</p>
<p>and the way that people approach food</p>
<p>and other types of behaviors.</p>
<p>But the sort of classic idea</p>
<p>was that all anorexics are perfectionists.</p>
<p>They want to perform well.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all about control and autonomy.</p>
<p>And bulimics are kind of dysregulated</p>
<p>and acting out against some early sexual trauma.</p>
<p>Those stereotypes of the psychological framework</p>
<p>of anorexics and bulimics doesn&rsquo;t hold up</p>
<p>when you look at the data.</p>
<p>Many meta-analyses have been done.</p>
<p>It just simply is not the case.</p>
<p>And in both instances, both anorexia and bulimia,</p>
<p>there are clear biological underpinnings</p>
<p>to what&rsquo;s driving the under-eating or the over-eating.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re going to talk about the biology</p>
<p>of under-eating and over-eating</p>
<p>and appropriate levels of eating.</p>
<p>And by doing that, we will start to identify</p>
<p>some of the mechanisms that serve as entry points</p>
<p>for the treatment of both anorexia and bulimia.</p>
<p>And as some of you are probably aware,</p>
<p>anorexia and bulimia can be comorbid.</p>
<p>They can exist with one another.</p>
<p>There are anorexics who will binge and then purge</p>
<p>in order to maintain that unhealthily low weight.</p>
<p>There are bulimics who fit the psychological criteria</p>
<p>of anorexia.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s a lot of overlap</p>
<p>between those two categories.</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s talk about the categorization for a second</p>
<p>and why the categorization has led to now</p>
<p>a bunch of other eating disorders</p>
<p>as defined by the psychiatric community.</p>
<p>One of the classic symptoms of anorexia</p>
<p>is a loss of menstrual cycles, loss of periods.</p>
<p>And the reason for that is when the body is undernourished,</p>
<p>the body fat stores send signals to the brain</p>
<p>to inform that the body is undernourished</p>
<p>or they turn off the signals that say,</p>
<p>look, there are enough body fat cells out here</p>
<p>to support healthy metabolism.</p>
<p>And therefore let&rsquo;s shut down ovulation.</p>
<p>Literally signal sent from the fat and muscle to the brain</p>
<p>and the brain, the hypothalamus and pituitary</p>
<p>will send signals down to the ovaries</p>
<p>or they will turn off the signals heading to the ovaries</p>
<p>to deploy eggs, the maturation of eggs in the follicle,</p>
<p>et cetera.</p>
<p>So there are instances in which people have anorexia</p>
<p>or have bulimia, but are still maintaining</p>
<p>healthy menstrual cycles or at least menstrual cycles.</p>
<p>And that has led to a whole set of other categorizations</p>
<p>of eating disorders like binge eating disorder,</p>
<p>where there tends to be a lot of overeating,</p>
<p>but not the purging or categorizations of anorexia</p>
<p>in which people are underfeeding,</p>
<p>but they are not losing their periods.</p>
<p>And so these have a number of different names and acronyms.</p>
<p>Some of them include things like EDNOS.</p>
<p>EDNOS is eating disorder, not otherwise specified.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a subcategorization or OSFEDS.</p>
<p>So OSFEDS is other specified feeding or eating disorder.</p>
<p>So right now, if you were to look online</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re looking to the psychiatric</p>
<p>and psychological textbooks,</p>
<p>what you would find is that there&rsquo;s a huge constellation</p>
<p>of eating disorders.</p>
<p>Today, we&rsquo;re mainly going to talk about anorexia, bulimia,</p>
<p>binge eating disorder, and body dysmorphia.</p>
<p>You can even find eating disorders like pica,</p>
<p>where people actually ingest things like dirt</p>
<p>or rocks or metal because they have a genuine appetite</p>
<p>for those things.</p>
<p>I certainly do not recommend sampling</p>
<p>any of those non-food items as foods.</p>
<p>It is incredibly dangerous.</p>
<p>People often poison themselves.</p>
<p>They often can cause structural blockages.</p>
<p>Some people have died from those sorts of things,</p>
<p>but nonetheless, there are aspects of our brain and biology</p>
<p>that when disrupted can lead to very bizarre</p>
<p>types of eating behavior.</p>
<p>Sometimes pica is caused by malnutrition, but not always.</p>
<p>And so today we&rsquo;re going to focus on the most prevalent</p>
<p>eating disorders, but we are going to build up</p>
<p>toward that understanding by looking at</p>
<p>what healthy metabolism and eating and satiety</p>
<p>and hunger looks like.</p>
<p>Because one, I realized that not everyone out there</p>
<p>has an eating disorder.</p>
<p>And two, I want people to understand this relationship</p>
<p>between how they think, the decisions they take</p>
<p>about what they eat, and how the body and the brain</p>
<p>at subconscious levels are driving some of these behaviors,</p>
<p>healthy or otherwise.</p>
<p>Because I do think that it can lead us</p>
<p>to a better understanding of what healthy eating is</p>
<p>for most of us and to increase compassion</p>
<p>and hopefully even increased improvement in treatment</p>
<p>of eating disorders for those that are suffering from them.</p>
<p>So what is hunger and what is satiety?</p>
<p>Satiety, of course, being sated,</p>
<p>or feeling like we&rsquo;ve had enough food.</p>
<p>I want to remind people of the basic mechanisms</p>
<p>by which the brain and body communicate.</p>
<p>This is vitally important, not just for this discussion,</p>
<p>but for any discussion about how we think,</p>
<p>how we behave, how we feel.</p>
<p>The body is communicating two types of information</p>
<p>to the brain on a regular basis,</p>
<p>but in particular around feeding.</p>
<p>And those two types of information</p>
<p>are mechanical information and chemical information.</p>
<p>What do I mean by mechanical information?</p>
<p>Well, if you take a deep breath and you hold your breath,</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;ll find is that you can hold your breath</p>
<p>a lot longer than if you exhale all your air</p>
<p>and you hold your breath with lungs empty.</p>
<p>And the reason is not because when your lungs are full,</p>
<p>you have enough oxygen,</p>
<p>and therefore you can hold your breath.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because when your lungs are full,</p>
<p>a particular class of neurons called baroreceptors</p>
<p>send information to the brain and say,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s pressure in the lungs.</p>
<p>And that means that there&rsquo;s probably oxygen in here.</p>
<p>And so the trigger to breathe is actually suppressed.</p>
<p>When your lungs are empty,</p>
<p>even if you have plenty of oxygen in your system,</p>
<p>those baroreceptors send a different signal to the brain,</p>
<p>which is, there&rsquo;s no oxygen in here and you should breathe.</p>
<p>And so the impulse to breathe comes earlier.</p>
<p>Likewise, when your stomach is full,</p>
<p>it sends signals to your brain that are purely based</p>
<p>on this mechanical fullness.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s nothing to do with nutrients that says I&rsquo;m full.</p>
<p>And therefore don&rsquo;t be as hungry.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t motivate to find or ingest food.</p>
<p>Whereas when our gut is empty,</p>
<p>even if we have plenty of nutrients</p>
<p>or plenty of body fat stores,</p>
<p>we tend to focus on food a bit more.</p>
<p>So volume and mechanical influences have a profound effect</p>
<p>on how we think and what we consider doing or not doing.</p>
<p>Likewise, chemical effects.</p>
<p>When we ingest food,</p>
<p>our so-called blood sugar or blood glucose levels go up.</p>
<p>That information is signaled to the brain</p>
<p>via neuronal pathways and hormonal pathways.</p>
<p>And in particular, there are neurons within our gut</p>
<p>that signal to areas of our brainstem</p>
<p>that are involved in satiety in our sense of having enough,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s food in our system.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s chemical information.</p>
<p>So how are hunger and feeding and satiety regulated</p>
<p>by way of mechanical and chemical signaling?</p>
<p>You have, I have, we all have neurons in our hypothalamus</p>
<p>that trigger eating and neurons that trigger cessation</p>
<p>or stopping of eating.</p>
<p>We have an accelerator on eating and we have a break.</p>
<p>And I covered all of this in a lot of detail</p>
<p>in the episode on feeding and metabolism and hunger.</p>
<p>So if you want a lot more detail, see that episode.</p>
<p>But right now, I&rsquo;m just going to give you the top contour</p>
<p>of how all that works.</p>
<p>Your hypothalamus is an area of your forebrain,</p>
<p>which tells you it&rsquo;s in the front,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s at the base of your forebrain,</p>
<p>sits more or less above the roof of your mouth.</p>
<p>The hypothalamus contains lots of different kinds of neurons,</p>
<p>including neurons that stimulate sexual activity and desire,</p>
<p>regulate your body temperature and control appetite</p>
<p>and ceasing of eating and appetite.</p>
<p>There are two types of neurons</p>
<p>within a particular area of your hypothalamus</p>
<p>that are relevant here.</p>
<p>There are the so-called POMC neurons, okay?</p>
<p>Pro-opioid melanocortin neurons</p>
<p>that tend to act as more of a break on appetite</p>
<p>by way of another hormone</p>
<p>called melanocyte-stimulating hormone.</p>
<p>And not so incidentally,</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re getting a lot of sunlight</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re viewing a lot of sunlight,</p>
<p>that system is ramped up.</p>
<p>This is why appetite is lower in the summer months</p>
<p>than it is in the winter months.</p>
<p>This is true in animals and this is true in humans.</p>
<p>And you have a class of neurons called the AGRP neurons.</p>
<p>The AGRP neurons are the ones that stimulate feeding</p>
<p>and they create a sort of anxiety or excitement about food.</p>
<p>It can be positive anxiety or it can be negative anxiety.</p>
<p>What do I mean by that?</p>
<p>Well, have you ever seen kids heading in to get ice cream?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re absolutely excited.</p>
<p>You see people getting ready to sit down and eat a big meal.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re excited to eat.</p>
<p>Sometimes that&rsquo;s due to social factors,</p>
<p>but they have an increase in overall levels</p>
<p>of autonomic arousal.</p>
<p>And depending on the context,</p>
<p>they can feel excited or anxious,</p>
<p>but it is a ramping up of energy.</p>
<p>These AGRP neurons are what caused that.</p>
<p>In fact, so much so that if you eliminate</p>
<p>or kill these neurons,</p>
<p>which has been done in experimental mouse models</p>
<p>in the laboratory,</p>
<p>but also there are humans that have lesions</p>
<p>or neurotoxic effects on these AGRP neurons.</p>
<p>And what you find is that they don&rsquo;t want to eat.</p>
<p>They essentially become anorexic,</p>
<p>meaning they don&rsquo;t want to ingest food.</p>
<p>They have no appetite for food whatsoever.</p>
<p>Now that&rsquo;s not exactly what anorexia is,</p>
<p>but these AGRP neurons are like an accelerator</p>
<p>on wanting to eat.</p>
<p>Whereas if you stimulate these AGRP neurons</p>
<p>or in humans that have say a small tumor</p>
<p>near these AGRP neurons, they become hyperphagic.</p>
<p>They will eat to the point of bursting.</p>
<p>Both animals and humans that have elevated levels</p>
<p>of these AGRP neurons are anxious.</p>
<p>They want to eat and they will ingest food</p>
<p>to the point where they override those mechanical</p>
<p>and chemical signals in the body.</p>
<p>And I know it sounds horrible and it is horrible.</p>
<p>They will eat until the point that they burst.</p>
<p>Now there are signals coming back from the body</p>
<p>to inform the brain about presence</p>
<p>of different levels of nutrients.</p>
<p>And that generally comes from three sources.</p>
<p>First of all is body fat.</p>
<p>The more body fat we have,</p>
<p>the more we secrete a hormone called leptin,</p>
<p>L-E-P-T-I-N, leptin from body fat.</p>
<p>Leptin goes to the brain and suppresses appetite.</p>
<p>This is a body to brain signaling mechanism</p>
<p>that says, look, I&rsquo;ve had enough.</p>
<p>Not incidentally, leptin signaling is disrupted</p>
<p>in people that have bulimia and obesity</p>
<p>and certain forms of binge eating disorder.</p>
<p>So that system is disrupted.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had enough signal or there&rsquo;s enough body fat here</p>
<p>such that you don&rsquo;t need to eat more, right?</p>
<p>Here I&rsquo;m sort of in the voice of the body fat</p>
<p>trying to talk to the brain.</p>
<p>That signal, that dialogue is mixed up or messed up.</p>
<p>In some cases it&rsquo;s absent entirely.</p>
<p>So the body fat is signaling to the brain</p>
<p>about how much reserve you have.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sort of like a savings account for energy</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s what body fat is.</p>
<p>You got lipids in there and through lipolysis,</p>
<p>they can be metabolized.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re interested in that process,</p>
<p>both how to increase it and just generally how it works,</p>
<p>you can see the episode on the science of fat loss.</p>
<p>The body fat is doing something else really interesting</p>
<p>that relates to anorexia.</p>
<p>When there&rsquo;s sufficient levels of body fat</p>
<p>and leptin circulating in the blood</p>
<p>and that leptin signal gets to the brain,</p>
<p>the hypothalamus and the pituitary gland</p>
<p>register that signal and in a completely subconscious way,</p>
<p>trigger the deployment of eggs in females</p>
<p>and the production of sperm in males.</p>
<p>So when body fat stores are very low,</p>
<p>the reason why periods shut off</p>
<p>or sperm production is reduced or even shut off</p>
<p>is because there&rsquo;s not enough leptin</p>
<p>getting to the hypothalamus and to the pituitary</p>
<p>and they shut off the signals, the hormones,</p>
<p>things like gonadotropin releasing hormone,</p>
<p>luteinizing hormone, follicle stimulating hormone,</p>
<p>all these hormones that you don&rsquo;t have to remember</p>
<p>the names of if you don&rsquo;t want to</p>
<p>that travel to the ovary or to the testes</p>
<p>and cause the ovary and testes to ovulate</p>
<p>or to produce more sperm.</p>
<p>So the reason why anorexic stop having periods</p>
<p>when they stop cycling</p>
<p>is because there isn&rsquo;t sufficient leptin in the bloodstream.</p>
<p>Now, there have been attempts to give leptin to anorexics</p>
<p>because leptin has been sequenced</p>
<p>and the peptide has been synthesized</p>
<p>and so you can inject leptin into people.</p>
<p>There are studies where they&rsquo;ve done that.</p>
<p>When that happens, it does not tend to alleviate</p>
<p>the anorexia, does not cause people to start eating again</p>
<p>and that actually makes sense because leptin</p>
<p>is also a way of shutting off the hunger signals</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the body fat&rsquo;s way of saying,</p>
<p>hey, there&rsquo;s a lot of body fat here</p>
<p>or there&rsquo;s sufficient body fat,</p>
<p>there doesn&rsquo;t even have to be a lot.</p>
<p>But it has in some cases been shown to rescue</p>
<p>the menstrual cycling in some anorexics.</p>
<p>Okay, so body fat is signaling to the brain,</p>
<p>the gut is signaling to the brain,</p>
<p>there are neurons in your gut that are primarily responding</p>
<p>to meaning they fire electrical signals</p>
<p>when there are sufficient fatty acids</p>
<p>coming from fats you ingest,</p>
<p>amino acids coming from proteins you ingest</p>
<p>and sugars coming from carbohydrates and sugars,</p>
<p>things like fructose, glucose, et cetera.</p>
<p>Those signals are being sent from the fat</p>
<p>and from the gut up to the brain</p>
<p>and therefore your body has multiple signals</p>
<p>of directing you toward eating more or eating less.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve got two categories of neurons,</p>
<p>one that acts as an accelerator, the AGRP neuron saying,</p>
<p>eat, eat and gets you excited to eat.</p>
<p>And then you have a category of neurons,</p>
<p>the PMOC neurons that are suppressing hunger,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re acting like a brake.</p>
<p>And the body is informing the brain all the time</p>
<p>about the status of the body</p>
<p>and whether or not it needs more food or not.</p>
<p>So you might ask, why is it that people who are overweight</p>
<p>and have a lot of body fat,</p>
<p>why they would continue to eat a lot?</p>
<p>Well, past a certain threshold of body fat,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when you start getting into</p>
<p>these so-called metabolic disorders</p>
<p>where blood glucose metabolism is disrupted,</p>
<p>leptin signaling is disrupted</p>
<p>and there are all sorts of changes on both the brain side</p>
<p>and the body end of things such that they&rsquo;re hungry</p>
<p>despite the fact that the body</p>
<p>has plenty of energy on reserve.</p>
<p>Okay, that I think is sufficient to explain</p>
<p>the basics of hunger and satiety</p>
<p>and a kind of a biological mechanism.</p>
<p>And the important thing again to remember</p>
<p>is that they&rsquo;re mechanical and chemical signals</p>
<p>that come from fullness or absence of fullness.</p>
<p>They come from the presence of glucose in the blood</p>
<p>or the absence of glucose in the blood.</p>
<p>When you haven&rsquo;t eaten for a long time,</p>
<p>glucagon levels go up, for instance, GLP-1 levels go up</p>
<p>and those will drive you to seek out food and want food.</p>
<p>And then there are these signals that are coming</p>
<p>from body fat and from neurons in the gut.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a lot of convergent signal, a lot of pathways.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t offer you all those pathways to confuse you.</p>
<p>I offer you those pathways to clarify the extent</p>
<p>to which something as simple as eating</p>
<p>or the decision to not eat is complicated.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve perhaps heard, or I&rsquo;ve certainly heard that,</p>
<p>oh, you know, it takes about 20 minutes</p>
<p>for satiety to set in.</p>
<p>You know, so you should eat slowly</p>
<p>that you won&rsquo;t realize that you&rsquo;re full</p>
<p>until about 20 minutes.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s actually not true.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know where that got started,</p>
<p>but we should probably all chew our food better</p>
<p>and eat more slowly,</p>
<p>be more mindful of what we&rsquo;re eating, et cetera.</p>
<p>So in anticipation of this episode,</p>
<p>I consulted extensively with a colleague of mine</p>
<p>at Stanford who sadly for us</p>
<p>is going off to University of Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>So our loss is University of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s win.</p>
<p>His name is Dr. Casey Halpern.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a MD, medical doctor and neurosurgeon,</p>
<p>and a PhD who studies binge eating disorder</p>
<p>and other types of eating disorders</p>
<p>and how they arise in the brain.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s developed some really pioneering treatments</p>
<p>for them.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll talk more about his work a little bit later</p>
<p>in the episode.</p>
<p>But we got to the discussion of why a body</p>
<p>that has sufficient energy levels</p>
<p>would desire to eat more at all.</p>
<p>And this is not just the case for binge eating disorder</p>
<p>or for bulimia, but why that would be the case.</p>
<p>You know, this is primitive biology</p>
<p>that evolved over many tens,</p>
<p>if not hundreds of thousands of years.</p>
<p>You see it in mice, you see it in humans,</p>
<p>very similar types of pathways and effects.</p>
<p>How is it that human beings who have plenty of fat</p>
<p>on reserve and plenty of glycogen in their liver, et cetera,</p>
<p>in other words, plenty of energy,</p>
<p>why they would be hungry, why they would eat at all?</p>
<p>It seems like that just shouldn&rsquo;t happen.</p>
<p>And he had a very important and I think clear</p>
<p>and intuitive way of framing up all this stuff</p>
<p>around eating and motivated behaviors</p>
<p>and how they can go awry,</p>
<p>not just in eating disorders, but in all of us.</p>
<p>Basically what he said was from an evolutionary standpoint,</p>
<p>it makes sense that we should eat as often as we can,</p>
<p>as much as we can, and as fast as we can.</p>
<p>Oh, that sounds crazy.</p>
<p>I was told to eat not too often, not too much,</p>
<p>and to eat slowly and chew my food.</p>
<p>But as Dr. Halpern pointed out,</p>
<p>there are circuits in the brain to reward eating often,</p>
<p>eating fast and cramming as much food into you as possible.</p>
<p>Because from a purely evolutionary standpoint,</p>
<p>food was scarce and seeking food was dangerous,</p>
<p>whether or not it was from animal sources or not.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s always been competitive.</p>
<p>For those of you that grew up in families</p>
<p>with a lot of siblings, this may resonate with you.</p>
<p>I just one sibling.</p>
<p>We were competitive about certain things,</p>
<p>but typically not competitive about food.</p>
<p>But I had friends that had a lot of siblings.</p>
<p>It was really interesting to see how food was served up</p>
<p>and how it was taken in those households.</p>
<p>It was like food would hit the table</p>
<p>and it was just an absolute war for portions.</p>
<p>And who got what and how much,</p>
<p>and who got a slightly bigger piece of cake, et cetera,</p>
<p>turned out to be a frequent happening in these meals</p>
<p>and at these birthday parties.</p>
<p>Whereas the only children perhaps</p>
<p>were used to having more food presented to them</p>
<p>without having to compete with other members of the species.</p>
<p>Every animal, including humans,</p>
<p>has a hardwired circuit that we were born with</p>
<p>that pays attention to how much food is available,</p>
<p>how much we are getting now,</p>
<p>and how much we are likely to get in the future.</p>
<p>And without going down the rabbit hole</p>
<p>of arcuate nucleus biology,</p>
<p>in two sentences,</p>
<p>you have a hypothalamic area called the arcuate nucleus.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a fascinating area.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually the area that houses these PMOC neurons</p>
<p>and these other types of neurons</p>
<p>that regulate hunger and satiety.</p>
<p>And these neurons in the arcuate nucleus</p>
<p>start getting active when we see food and think about food.</p>
<p>They drive hunger and they drive hunger</p>
<p>in a way that&rsquo;s responsive to what the food looks like,</p>
<p>what it smells like,</p>
<p>but also our prior history of interactions with that food.</p>
<p>And it takes into account social context,</p>
<p>whether or not we are going to get the whole pizza</p>
<p>to ourselves or whether or not there are going to be others</p>
<p>that we are going to have to compete with.</p>
<p>So there are a lot of signals that this arcuate nucleus</p>
<p>in your brain are paying attention to.</p>
<p>So Dr. Halpern pointed out</p>
<p>that you actually have an accelerator</p>
<p>that increases your level of awareness and anxiety</p>
<p>and sort of constricts your field of view</p>
<p>and all your senses anytime you interact with food</p>
<p>and is driving a primitive reflex</p>
<p>to ingest as much food as you can, as quickly as you can,</p>
<p>and then move on from there</p>
<p>and presumably to do the same elsewhere.</p>
<p>So that changed the way that I think about eating behavior</p>
<p>and eating disorders.</p>
<p>In fact, we could think about eating disorders like bulimia</p>
<p>as an unmasking of that mechanism</p>
<p>without the so-called top-down control,</p>
<p>without the mechanisms that we use to regulate our behavior.</p>
<p>And indeed, bulimia and binge eating disorder</p>
<p>are closely associated with impulsivity</p>
<p>and with impulsive behaviors of other kinds,</p>
<p>something that we also will discuss more.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the pathway?</p>
<p>How does this work?</p>
<p>What is Dr. Halpern and his colleagues doing</p>
<p>in order to try and treat things like binge eating disorder?</p>
<p>Well, you can frame all of behavior,</p>
<p>good decision-making and bad decision-making</p>
<p>in a pretty simple box diagram model.</p>
<p>And I realize that many of you are listening to this,</p>
<p>not watching this, and there is no diagram to look at.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just explain it</p>
<p>so that you can conceptualize it in your mind.</p>
<p>We have knowledge of what we should do in one box.</p>
<p>Okay, we should eat that, we shouldn&rsquo;t eat that.</p>
<p>We should wait for dinner, we shouldn&rsquo;t wait for dinner.</p>
<p>And then we have what we actually do in another box.</p>
<p>Okay, now this is true for all behaviors.</p>
<p>We should say something,</p>
<p>or we want to say something, but we don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>We shouldn&rsquo;t say something, but we do anyway.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the knowledge, the kind of looping in your head.</p>
<p>I should do my homework.</p>
<p>I should go for a run.</p>
<p>I shouldn&rsquo;t do this right now.</p>
<p>I shouldn&rsquo;t be on social media.</p>
<p>All those kinds of shoulds and shouldn&rsquo;ts</p>
<p>that are circulating in your head.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one box.</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s what you actually do, the behavior,</p>
<p>whether or not you suppress the behavior,</p>
<p>you turn off your phone and you go read a book</p>
<p>or you go to sleep or whether or not you stay up all night</p>
<p>or you stay up for another hour, even five minutes.</p>
<p>In between those two boxes are two intervening forces.</p>
<p>And those intervening forces are critically important.</p>
<p>Those intervening forces are homeostatic processes,</p>
<p>called by some processes, same thing.</p>
<p>Homeostatic processes that regulate the balance</p>
<p>of different systems in your body,</p>
<p>hot and cold, awake or asleep, dopamine,</p>
<p>and the desire to pursue things,</p>
<p>serotonin and the desire to just relax and chill.</p>
<p>So homeostatic processes and reward systems.</p>
<p>And as we now move into discussion about anorexia</p>
<p>and bulimia specifically,</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;ll see is that anorexia and bulimia</p>
<p>are not a breaking of the mindset of what one should do</p>
<p>or shouldn&rsquo;t do.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a disruption of these homeostatic and reward processes</p>
<p>such that decision-making is completely disrupted</p>
<p>and in many cases is not available</p>
<p>to the anorexic or bulimic.</p>
<p>Now, I don&rsquo;t want to be abstract here.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m saying is that the person who starves themselves</p>
<p>to the point where they might die,</p>
<p>and in some cases sadly do die,</p>
<p>they can know perfectly well that their behavior</p>
<p>is leading to bad outcomes and possibly even death.</p>
<p>And yet they are not able to intervene</p>
<p>unless they get particular clinical help.</p>
<p>Because the homeostatic processes,</p>
<p>the signals from the body and brain that say,</p>
<p>you need food, those aren&rsquo;t registering in the same way</p>
<p>that they are for other individuals.</p>
<p>And for the bulimic or the person that suffers</p>
<p>from binge eating disorder,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t necessarily want to eat that food.</p>
<p>They simply cannot help it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a reflex for them</p>
<p>because the homeostatic processes</p>
<p>and the reward processes associated with food</p>
<p>are such that they can&rsquo;t intervene</p>
<p>between the should do X, Y, or Z,</p>
<p>or shouldn&rsquo;t do X, Y, or Z,</p>
<p>and what their actual behavior is.</p>
<p>Now, this isn&rsquo;t just a biological mechanistic explanation</p>
<p>for what could have been summarized in two sentences.</p>
<p>What this is, is a roadmap of where interventions</p>
<p>can really make a difference.</p>
<p>So as we talk about different drug-based interventions</p>
<p>or behavioral interventions or social interventions,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like you to think about whether or not</p>
<p>those interventions are breaking into</p>
<p>or tapping into this box of the thinking,</p>
<p>the sort of pattern of thinking around food,</p>
<p>whether or not it&rsquo;s the behavior, the actual ingestion,</p>
<p>or the restriction of food,</p>
<p>or whether or not it&rsquo;s tapping into the homeostatic process,</p>
<p>the balance of energy systems</p>
<p>and kind of getting enough, but not too much,</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s tapping into the reward system.</p>
<p>And just as a little teaser of where we&rsquo;re headed,</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;ll find based on the data,</p>
<p>clinical data experiments done very carefully</p>
<p>and very well by excellent groups,</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;ll find is that anorexics</p>
<p>have a sort of switch that&rsquo;s been flipped</p>
<p>such that their decision-making</p>
<p>is actually pretty darn good.</p>
<p>It might even be better than yours</p>
<p>in terms of evaluating food, nutritional content,</p>
<p>but their habits are disrupted.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re not even consciously aware of the fact</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re making terrible,</p>
<p>and in some cases, very dangerous food choices.</p>
<p>It turns out that habits and the way that we build</p>
<p>and break and rebuild new habits</p>
<p>is one of the most effective treatments for anorexia.</p>
<p>So now let&rsquo;s talk about anorexia,</p>
<p>this failure to consume enough energy</p>
<p>such that the individual is at risk of death.</p>
<p>And if not death, then severe metabolic disorders,</p>
<p>lack of bone density, et cetera.</p>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, anorexia and things</p>
<p>that almost certainly were and are anorexia</p>
<p>have been described as early as the 1600s</p>
<p>and maybe even earlier.</p>
<p>There are some records from the saints,</p>
<p>from the 1400s of people that refuse to ingest food.</p>
<p>Another common myth is that anorexia</p>
<p>is only the sort of thing that you see in rich societies.</p>
<p>These are spoiled children with so much food</p>
<p>that they decide they&rsquo;re only going to focus</p>
<p>on how slim they are,</p>
<p>how they look in bathing suits, et cetera.</p>
<p>Not true.</p>
<p>A careful analysis through medical epidemiology</p>
<p>has shown that you find anorexia</p>
<p>even in cultures and societies where food is scarce.</p>
<p>So that really speaks to biological mechanism.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s hard to unveil in societies where food is scarce</p>
<p>because a lot of people are starving and hungry,</p>
<p>but there are individuals that choose still to avoid food</p>
<p>and seem to have some sort of reward mechanism</p>
<p>that rewards them or makes them feel better</p>
<p>if they don&rsquo;t eat,</p>
<p>despite the fact that their body</p>
<p>is severely depleted of nutrients.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s very interesting and points again</p>
<p>to some disruption in some biological mechanism.</p>
<p>Now, I want to make sure that I&rsquo;m emphasizing</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m not in favor of people,</p>
<p>in particular young children, adolescents,</p>
<p>and teenagers being bombarded</p>
<p>with unrealistic imagery about bodies.</p>
<p>But the idea that that&rsquo;s the cause of,</p>
<p>or is amplifying anorexia,</p>
<p>the data just don&rsquo;t seem to support that.</p>
<p>Anorexia in its classic sense</p>
<p>requires that there be an endocrine,</p>
<p>meaning a hormonal disruption,</p>
<p>menstrual abnormalities, lack of sperm production,</p>
<p>or low testosterone in males,</p>
<p>in order to meet the classification for anorexia.</p>
<p>But as I mentioned earlier,</p>
<p>there are now nuanced and new classifications of anorexia</p>
<p>that even for individuals that still menstruate</p>
<p>or that maintain sperm production,</p>
<p>that anorexia can still be considered</p>
<p>a clinically diagnosable disorder.</p>
<p>Now, typically anorexia starts in adolescence</p>
<p>right around puberty.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at what puberty is.</p>
<p>Puberty at a very broad level</p>
<p>is the most significant and dramatic developmental step</p>
<p>anyone goes through in their lifespan.</p>
<p>The body changes, the brain changes, perceptions change,</p>
<p>one&rsquo;s own self-perception changes.</p>
<p>And most of those changes</p>
<p>are driven by changes in circuitry within the hypothalamus.</p>
<p>So neurons that are controlling the production</p>
<p>of the so-called sex steroid hormones,</p>
<p>things like testosterone, estrogen,</p>
<p>and related hormones, prolactin, et cetera,</p>
<p>those are all changing at very rapid rates.</p>
<p>Anorexia tends to show up around this time</p>
<p>in a subset of individuals</p>
<p>who on the face of it seem to find food aversive.</p>
<p>Now, the purely psychological theory of this</p>
<p>is that they are fighting for autonomy.</p>
<p>They want control.</p>
<p>Puberty is also a time in which children and parents</p>
<p>are in a tug of war over control.</p>
<p>You were once a small child being told when to go to bed,</p>
<p>sent to your room,</p>
<p>now you&rsquo;re a child that can talk back and say,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to, or I refuse to.</p>
<p>And that happens a lot in various households</p>
<p>as I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re familiar with.</p>
<p>Adolescence and puberty is also</p>
<p>when girls start menstruating typically,</p>
<p>or boys develop deeper voice,</p>
<p>they start producing sperm, et cetera.</p>
<p>So there are a lot of bodily changes</p>
<p>that also drive perceptual changes</p>
<p>and perceptual changes that drive bodily changes.</p>
<p>And it is a dramatic shift for a young girl or boy</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t nourish themselves sufficiently</p>
<p>during that period.</p>
<p>There are a number of downstream negative effects.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll list out some of them.</p>
<p>These are just a subset of the effects.</p>
<p>Hypogonadism, that&rsquo;s the lack of sperm production</p>
<p>or healthy egg production.</p>
<p>There is amenorrhea, which is the lack of menstrual cycling.</p>
<p>Okay, so a failure to have a menstrual cycle.</p>
<p>Reduced insulin secretion.</p>
<p>Insulin is this hormone that&rsquo;s released</p>
<p>in order to help shuttle glucose</p>
<p>into various tissues for energy utilization.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s down because energy levels are down so much.</p>
<p>One of the symptoms that&rsquo;s a little more cryptic</p>
<p>and that has actually interesting implications</p>
<p>for sake of the cholesterol hypothesis</p>
<p>is that anorexics who ingest very little food</p>
<p>often have cosmically high levels of cholesterol,</p>
<p>including LDL, low density lipoprotein cholesterol.</p>
<p>You say, well, how could that possibly be?</p>
<p>We were all told and continue to be told from many sources</p>
<p>that ingestion of dietary cholesterol</p>
<p>is what drives high levels of bodily cholesterol.</p>
<p>Cholesterol is manufactured by the liver</p>
<p>and in anorexics who consume very little food,</p>
<p>they often have cosmically high levels of cholesterol,</p>
<p>which is one of the kind of wrinkles</p>
<p>in the so-called dietary cholesterol hypothesis</p>
<p>that all of our cholesterol that we see on a blood panel</p>
<p>is due to what we eat.</p>
<p>But the explanation for it is that under conditions</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s not sufficient cholesterol</p>
<p>to synthesize the sex steroid hormones,</p>
<p>things like testosterone and estrogen,</p>
<p>which are required in both males and females,</p>
<p>those are made from cholesterol,</p>
<p>that the body, the liver will start generating</p>
<p>its own cholesterol and will often overshoot the mark</p>
<p>to a dramatic degree.</p>
<p>So the blood lipid profiles in anorexics</p>
<p>are often very unhealthy,</p>
<p>despite the fact that they&rsquo;re eating very little food.</p>
<p>In addition, they tend to have elevated levels</p>
<p>of things like vasopressin,</p>
<p>which are hormones that regulate body temperature</p>
<p>and blood volume.</p>
<p>They tend to have low blood pressure.</p>
<p>They can pass out.</p>
<p>I mentioned some of the other symptoms earlier.</p>
<p>In other words,</p>
<p>there are a huge number of terrible things happening.</p>
<p>Thyroid levels are down.</p>
<p>Heart rates are down.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m painting a very bleak picture here,</p>
<p>it is indeed a bleak picture.</p>
<p>So we have to ask ourselves,</p>
<p>what can be done for the anorexic, right?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say it&rsquo;s a failure of the AGRP neurons</p>
<p>to stimulate appetite and feeding.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say it&rsquo;s too much anxiety around food.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say it&rsquo;s because of the way that food restriction</p>
<p>was used for reward in the household, right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m making this up,</p>
<p>but you can imagine a hypothetical scenario</p>
<p>where the, let&rsquo;s just say the mother</p>
<p>of a particular individual</p>
<p>is very vocal about her avoidance of food.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve seen this before, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve probably seen somebody who loves to cook</p>
<p>and prepare food, but then sits down</p>
<p>and doesn&rsquo;t seem to eat.</p>
<p>And they always seem to, in air quotes,</p>
<p>have eaten earlier.</p>
<p>I ate while I cooked.</p>
<p>I ate while I cooked, right?</p>
<p>These people that you never actually see eating.</p>
<p>We all know people like this.</p>
<p>Are they anorexic?</p>
<p>Possibly, we don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>A child observes that kind of behavior.</p>
<p>Maybe that individual is being,</p>
<p>always being told how beautiful they look</p>
<p>or how wonderful or fit they look,</p>
<p>what incredible meals they produce.</p>
<p>And you could imagine a purely psychosocial set of events</p>
<p>that could lead a child to be anorexic.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t seem to be the case,</p>
<p>at least not in terms of driving classic anorexia,</p>
<p>of really extreme deprivation of oneself from food.</p>
<p>However, there&rsquo;s a strong genetic component for anorexia.</p>
<p>So you could imagine a mild form of anorexia in a parent</p>
<p>that is supported or exacerbated by praise</p>
<p>so that the person feels good from the praise</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re getting, that they want to be a low body weight</p>
<p>for whatever reason, for aesthetic reasons,</p>
<p>or for whatever reasons that happen to appeal to them.</p>
<p>And the child has a genetic predisposition, right?</p>
<p>We never think about genes in terms of controlling behavior.</p>
<p>Genes bias probabilities for behavior, okay?</p>
<p>So you can have a gene for depression or for schizophrenia,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not deterministic in the same way</p>
<p>that there are genes that determine your eye color</p>
<p>or your skin color or your hair color, okay?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a genetic predisposition there.</p>
<p>And that genetic predisposition could exist</p>
<p>such that if one is rewarded enough times</p>
<p>for a particular behavior,</p>
<p>that behavior can start to ratchet in</p>
<p>to our neural circuitry,</p>
<p>because behavior drives neural changes,</p>
<p>so-called neuroplasticity.</p>
<p>And you could imagine that that child</p>
<p>could develop a full-blown case of anorexia.</p>
<p>And this is why I raised at the beginning</p>
<p>that no one really knows how to define healthy eating.</p>
<p>And so therefore we have to rely on just identification</p>
<p>of unhealthy behaviors.</p>
<p>But what do we point people to</p>
<p>in terms of what healthy replacement behaviors would be?</p>
<p>So rather than just look at anorexics</p>
<p>and say they&rsquo;re not eating enough,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s this huge array of terrible things</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re doing to their body,</p>
<p>and they need to eat more,</p>
<p>we need to rescue them from themselves.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look under the hood.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at what&rsquo;s known about the neural circuitry</p>
<p>and the sorts of perceptions and behaviors</p>
<p>that the neural circuitry is driving</p>
<p>in order to understand what they are truly suffering from</p>
<p>at the level of cause, not just symptoms.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s clear what they&rsquo;re suffering from</p>
<p>at the level of symptoms.</p>
<p>Symptoms are how we diagnose.</p>
<p>I listed off a number of those things.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s look under the hood</p>
<p>and try and identify where one could intervene in theory</p>
<p>in order to try and rescue the anorexic</p>
<p>or help the anorexic rescue themselves.</p>
<p>Because it turns out that the answer,</p>
<p>or at least one of the answers of how to do that</p>
<p>is not intuitive at all.</p>
<p>At least to me was very surprising.</p>
<p>I would be remiss if I didn&rsquo;t start with the obvious,</p>
<p>which is, is there a chemical defect?</p>
<p>Meaning, is there some disruption</p>
<p>in one of the major chemical systems in the brain</p>
<p>that makes anorexics anorexic?</p>
<p>And therefore, can we replace that chemical</p>
<p>or can we reduce some chemical</p>
<p>and essentially eliminate anorexia?</p>
<p>And the answer is not really sort of maybe no.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s why.</p>
<p>There are a lot of different chemicals in the brain and body</p>
<p>but there are a category of chemicals</p>
<p>that are particularly important</p>
<p>that if you&rsquo;ve listened to this podcast before,</p>
<p>even if you haven&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>are going to come up again and again and again.</p>
<p>And that is the category of chemicals in the brain and body</p>
<p>called the neuromodulators.</p>
<p>Neuromodulators are different than neurotransmitters</p>
<p>in the sense that neuromodulators modulate</p>
<p>or change the activity of brain areas and neural circuits.</p>
<p>You can think of them as microphones</p>
<p>that are held between particular sets</p>
<p>of connections in the brain</p>
<p>that make those connections in the brain</p>
<p>more likely to be active relative to others, okay?</p>
<p>They make them louder, so to speak.</p>
<p>There are many neuromodulators</p>
<p>but the ones that are important</p>
<p>for sake of today&rsquo;s discussion are the classic ones.</p>
<p>Dopamine, acetylcholine, norepinephrine, and serotonin.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s focus on serotonin.</p>
<p>Serotonin is a neuromodulator</p>
<p>that tends to increase the activity</p>
<p>of certain neural circuits,</p>
<p>including within the hypothalamus,</p>
<p>but also within the body,</p>
<p>that trigger a sense of satiety of having enough,</p>
<p>enough food, enough warmth, enough social connection,</p>
<p>enough of any motivated goal or drive</p>
<p>or any type of thing or behavior</p>
<p>that one would want more of.</p>
<p>Serotonin tends to make those circuits quiet down.</p>
<p>Now, there are many categories of drugs</p>
<p>that emphasize the serotonergic circuitry,</p>
<p>meaning they cause the release of</p>
<p>or the efficiency of serotonin in the brain and body.</p>
<p>Things like Prozac, Zoloft, Paxil, things of that variety.</p>
<p>Those drugs have been used to some degree of success,</p>
<p>although not much, to treat things like anorexia nervosa.</p>
<p>That should make sense</p>
<p>because if these drugs increase serotonin,</p>
<p>if their general effect is to increase serotonin,</p>
<p>it will be to lower anxiety.</p>
<p>That sounds like a great thing.</p>
<p>A lot of anorexics are really anxious around food.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll talk about why.</p>
<p>Lowering anxiety, you might think,</p>
<p>would lead to ingestion of more food,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s not often what happens.</p>
<p>Increasing serotonin by way of some drug regimen</p>
<p>will tend to make one less hungry.</p>
<p>Because with heightened levels of serotonin</p>
<p>in the blood and brain,</p>
<p>there isn&rsquo;t the desire to go seek out the things</p>
<p>that will raise serotonin on their own.</p>
<p>Now, some anorexics do well</p>
<p>or benefit from these serotonergic drugs,</p>
<p>these drugs that increase the activity of these circuits</p>
<p>that lead to satiety.</p>
<p>But if you think about the major goal</p>
<p>of treating an anorexic,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s to get them to have more hunger, more appetite.</p>
<p>So now I want to focus on some of the work</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s been done around the habits</p>
<p>and behaviors of anorexics,</p>
<p>because those turned out to be ideal places</p>
<p>for intervention.</p>
<p>The work I&rsquo;m about to describe</p>
<p>was done by Dr. Joanna Steinglass and colleagues</p>
<p>at Columbia University in New York.</p>
<p>And there are other groups as well.</p>
<p>Of course, they&rsquo;re doing this type of work,</p>
<p>but they did what I think are really</p>
<p>some beautiful experiments</p>
<p>and some beautiful explorations</p>
<p>of potential treatments for anorexics</p>
<p>that seem to have a quite high degree of effectiveness</p>
<p>when they are applied correctly.</p>
<p>First of all, there&rsquo;s a challenge in studying anorexia</p>
<p>because in anorexia, what you&rsquo;re essentially studying</p>
<p>is the absence of a behavior.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very hard to study the absence of a behavior</p>
<p>as opposed to a behavior.</p>
<p>So they did some experiments with anorexics,</p>
<p>giving them a gallery of pictures of different foods</p>
<p>and allowing those anorexic patients</p>
<p>to arrange those foods according to preference</p>
<p>about what they would select,</p>
<p>about food nutrient content, about caloric content.</p>
<p>They essentially asked these anorexics to evaluate food.</p>
<p>And in doing so, they were able to identify</p>
<p>something that&rsquo;s very unique to anorexics</p>
<p>at the level of their perception of food.</p>
<p>What they found is that anorexics,</p>
<p>rather than being anxious in the presence of food</p>
<p>and that anxiety driving an avoidance of food,</p>
<p>what they found is that anorexics have a hyperacuity,</p>
<p>a hyper awareness of the fat content of foods,</p>
<p>almost to the point of being sort of fat content savants.</p>
<p>Now they don&rsquo;t necessarily know that they&rsquo;re doing this.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not looking at an avocado and thinking,</p>
<p>okay, that&rsquo;s X number of grams of fat rather,</p>
<p>or looking at an apple and saying, okay, that has no fat.</p>
<p>They start to do this more or less reflexively.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s a well-known symptom of anorexia,</p>
<p>especially young anorexics,</p>
<p>that they have kind of an obsession with food,</p>
<p>caloric contents, macronutrient ratios,</p>
<p>meaning fat, protein, and carbohydrate ratios.</p>
<p>They know caloric numbers,</p>
<p>but then they sort of pass that information</p>
<p>into a memory system in their brain</p>
<p>that allows their interactions with food</p>
<p>to be very reflexive in a way</p>
<p>that they are actively avoiding high fat content foods,</p>
<p>calorie rich foods,</p>
<p>and defaulting towards very low calorie foods</p>
<p>if they have to eat.</p>
<p>Now, this might seem like an almost trivial result</p>
<p>on the face of it.</p>
<p>You think, okay, they don&rsquo;t like to eat.</p>
<p>When they do eat, they eat low calorie, low fat foods, duh.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s the way in which</p>
<p>they are doing this subconsciously,</p>
<p>that they learn this information</p>
<p>and then they pass it off to a reflexive habit.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s very important</p>
<p>because what that means is that we need to look at</p>
<p>what processes in the brain, what brain areas,</p>
<p>what chemicals drive decision-making and knowledge.</p>
<p>And we also need to look at the areas of the brain</p>
<p>that drive habit formation and habit execution.</p>
<p>Because for any of you that have habits,</p>
<p>and that means all of you,</p>
<p>the hallmark feature of a habit is that it&rsquo;s reflexive.</p>
<p>You have a mosquito bite on your leg, you scratch it.</p>
<p>You didn&rsquo;t necessarily even think,</p>
<p>oh, I&rsquo;m going to scratch that.</p>
<p>In fact, just to take a little bit of a moment of respite</p>
<p>and talk about habits in general,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a beautiful study that was done</p>
<p>out of Caltech University,</p>
<p>looking at the parking lot</p>
<p>of where people park in the morning</p>
<p>without designated parking spots</p>
<p>and the trajectories that they use</p>
<p>to walk to their offices in the morning.</p>
<p>So they put cameras up on the roof of Caltech.</p>
<p>This is the kind of thing that the nerdy kids at Caltech do.</p>
<p>I think at Caltech, if you call someone a nerd,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a compliment.</p>
<p>So my apologies to the non-nerds at Caltech.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s one or two of you.</p>
<p>And for the nerdy ones of you at Caltech, you&rsquo;re welcome.</p>
<p>They videotaped the behaviors of these faculty</p>
<p>and students and staff.</p>
<p>And what they found is that people follow trajectories</p>
<p>from their car that are remarkably stereotyped.</p>
<p>First of all, they tend to park always in the same spot</p>
<p>if they can.</p>
<p>They tend to get out of their car, of course,</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re on the driver&rsquo;s side</p>
<p>or passenger side in the same place.</p>
<p>They turn and pivot their body</p>
<p>at approximately the same rate every day.</p>
<p>They close the door,</p>
<p>they put their bag on their shoulder or across their chest</p>
<p>or however it is that they carry their briefcase</p>
<p>or whatever it is.</p>
<p>And they follow trajectories onto campus</p>
<p>that are so stereotyped that you&rsquo;d wonder</p>
<p>if you just trace line after line after line,</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;d find is that every day</p>
<p>is almost exactly the same.</p>
<p>And you do this too.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t realize it because if you&rsquo;re being videotaped</p>
<p>doing this kind of behavior,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not being released to you.</p>
<p>But your behaviors are so stereotyped to the point where</p>
<p>if you were to see them laid out in front of you</p>
<p>in kind of diagrammatic format of the lines</p>
<p>and the trajectories that you follow throughout the day,</p>
<p>the lifting of your mug</p>
<p>and how frequently you drink each hour,</p>
<p>you would be amazed and probably a little bit scared</p>
<p>by how much of a robot we all are.</p>
<p>Now that robotic aspect of our neural circuitry is vital</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s what allows us to think about other things</p>
<p>and do other things and drive other behaviors.</p>
<p>But the work of Dr. Steinglass and colleagues</p>
<p>showed that in the case of the anorexic,</p>
<p>those habits are exactly the place</p>
<p>where things start to go awry</p>
<p>and that drive this very dysfunctional</p>
<p>under eating behavior that sadly often leads to death</p>
<p>or certainly bad medical outcomes.</p>
<p>And it turns out that the brain areas associated</p>
<p>with habit formation and execution</p>
<p>are the best point of intervention.</p>
<p>So what Dr. Steinglass and colleagues did</p>
<p>is they took anorexics</p>
<p>and they of course had control groups</p>
<p>and they put them in an fMRI scanner,</p>
<p>which are these brain scanners that allow you to evaluate</p>
<p>which brain areas are active during particular tasks.</p>
<p>And because when you&rsquo;re in one of those scanners,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re actually, you know,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve actually been in one of these things,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re biting down on a bite bar</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re most of the time in most all of these scanners,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re immobile.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re looking at things on a TV screen.</p>
<p>Sometimes you can press buttons</p>
<p>to select choices and so forth,</p>
<p>but you can&rsquo;t really eat within those things.</p>
<p>What they found was that reward-based decision-making,</p>
<p>the drive to pursue a particular food</p>
<p>or the drive to perform a particular task,</p>
<p>which is a lot of what we do throughout our day,</p>
<p>that was controlled by a brain area</p>
<p>called the ventromedial prefrontal cortex.</p>
<p>Let me simplify a little bit of this,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m going to simplify it by giving you a little detail</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s the Huberman Lab podcast.</p>
<p>And I believe in mechanism.</p>
<p>Mechanism is the way that you get true understanding</p>
<p>and that you can then be very quick</p>
<p>and give overviews of things, but you need the mechanism.</p>
<p>So you have reflexes and you have neural processes</p>
<p>that include what are called duration path</p>
<p>and outcome type processes.</p>
<p>A duration path outcome type process,</p>
<p>we can shorten with DPO.</p>
<p>DPO is for all types of goal related behaviors.</p>
<p>So for instance,</p>
<p>if you want to get a particular grade on an exam,</p>
<p>you want to learn something,</p>
<p>you want to complete a workout,</p>
<p>you want to go to the grocery store and pick some stuff up</p>
<p>and then head home, you&rsquo;re going to think duration.</p>
<p>How long do I have?</p>
<p>Okay, do I have 45 minutes to get to the store?</p>
<p>How long does it take to get to the store?</p>
<p>Path, which way am I going to drive there?</p>
<p>Which way am I going to navigate through the grocery store?</p>
<p>Outcome, was I able to get in and get the items I need</p>
<p>and get home in time?</p>
<p>Okay, DPO, duration path outcome.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very conscious process.</p>
<p>You tend to take into account different criteria</p>
<p>related to what&rsquo;s preventing you</p>
<p>from accomplishing what you want to do</p>
<p>and what&rsquo;s helping you or assisting you.</p>
<p>So of course, as you get to the checkout line</p>
<p>in the grocery store,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to select the shortest line, for instance.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s all DPO stuff.</p>
<p>It requires decision-making and it&rsquo;s reward based.</p>
<p>You use these DPO type processes in the short term</p>
<p>to pick up groceries and pick a line at the grocery store</p>
<p>and decide which trajectory to take home.</p>
<p>And you use them for navigating long,</p>
<p>extended processes in life,</p>
<p>trying to get a degree or raise children</p>
<p>or get through a particularly challenging year, et cetera.</p>
<p>So duration path outcome,</p>
<p>and that entire process relies on your forebrain,</p>
<p>this prefrontal cortex.</p>
<p>The prefrontal cortex is what allows you</p>
<p>to take information from memory,</p>
<p>combine it with information about what&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>in the present context,</p>
<p>and then to direct your behavior, your speech, et cetera,</p>
<p>toward particular outcomes.</p>
<p>And if all that sounds like a mouthful, it is,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s very metabolically demanding.</p>
<p>Decision-making is metabolically demanding.</p>
<p>It takes effort, okay?</p>
<p>Reflexes, on the other hand,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t involve the prefrontal cortex in the same way.</p>
<p>Habits and reflexes, like once you know how to walk,</p>
<p>you get up and you walk.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to think about right foot, left foot,</p>
<p>right foot, left foot, you just do it.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t rely on prefrontal cortex.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s subconscious as it&rsquo;s sometimes called,</p>
<p>but basically you don&rsquo;t have to use the parts of the brain</p>
<p>that are involved in duration path</p>
<p>and outcome type analyses, okay?</p>
<p>So in this particular study,</p>
<p>they examined brain activity in anorexics</p>
<p>who are selecting different foods.</p>
<p>And as I mentioned earlier,</p>
<p>they have a hyperacuity or awareness</p>
<p>of which foods contain more or less calories</p>
<p>than other foods and what the fat content</p>
<p>of particular foods is in particular, et cetera.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re doing all this while in a scanner,</p>
<p>and then they look at what sorts of brain areas are active</p>
<p>after that task is done.</p>
<p>And what they found was really interesting.</p>
<p>What they found was that the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex,</p>
<p>not surprisingly, is involved in the decision-making</p>
<p>and the evaluation of this food,</p>
<p>which foods are going to be best to eat in this context,</p>
<p>which foods are going to be appropriate</p>
<p>for at least that anorexics framework</p>
<p>about what&rsquo;s okay to eat and what&rsquo;s not okay to eat</p>
<p>and how much.</p>
<p>However, there are areas of the brain that were active</p>
<p>after that decision-making process.</p>
<p>And those are the brain areas that turn out</p>
<p>to drive the habit of avoiding particular foods</p>
<p>and approaching other foods.</p>
<p>And in that case,</p>
<p>it wasn&rsquo;t the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.</p>
<p>It was an area of the brain</p>
<p>called the dorsolateral striatum.</p>
<p>Now, the striatum is a big area in the brain.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s involved in a lot of different things.</p>
<p>It includes areas like the caudate and putanum.</p>
<p>And I just want to mention,</p>
<p>as I throw out all these names,</p>
<p>you do not need to remember the names</p>
<p>of these different structures.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just there if you are interested</p>
<p>in that level of detail.</p>
<p>But basically you have a brain area</p>
<p>and anorexics have a brain area</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s involved in evaluating</p>
<p>and decision-making around food.</p>
<p>And then another brain area that&rsquo;s involved</p>
<p>in the reflexive consumption of particular foods</p>
<p>and the reflexive avoidance of other foods.</p>
<p>If you remember way back at the beginning of the episode,</p>
<p>I feel like that was a long time ago now,</p>
<p>when we talked about how you have</p>
<p>these sorts of processes in the brain,</p>
<p>but there are always homeostatic and reward systems</p>
<p>influencing this kind of thing.</p>
<p>Well, in the brain of the anorexic,</p>
<p>it turns out that the reward systems</p>
<p>have been attached to the execution of habits</p>
<p>in a way that is unhealthy for body weight,</p>
<p>but at least from a purely neural circuit perspective,</p>
<p>the reward is now given,</p>
<p>this chemical reward in the brain</p>
<p>is given for avoiding particular foods</p>
<p>and only approaching these very low calorie, low fat foods.</p>
<p>So there really does seem to be a flip in the switch</p>
<p>in the anorexic brain that rewards them internally.</p>
<p>They feel good when they avoid certain foods</p>
<p>and they approach others.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not a deprivation-based model</p>
<p>where they are flagellating themselves or masochistic</p>
<p>or actively avoiding food in order to punish themselves,</p>
<p>which is interesting</p>
<p>because a lot of psychological theories support that idea.</p>
<p>Rather, once this transitions into a set of habits,</p>
<p>they are actually getting a sense of reward.</p>
<p>They feel good,</p>
<p>presumably from the release of a different neuromodulator</p>
<p>called dopamine by approaching foods that are low fat,</p>
<p>low calorie content.</p>
<p>And so their whole brain circuitry is skewed</p>
<p>toward avoiding particular things</p>
<p>and they actually are rewarded for that and they feel good.</p>
<p>They feel better than if they were eating</p>
<p>in a healthy weight-supporting way.</p>
<p>Now the dorsolateral striatum is a structure</p>
<p>that we should think about in a little bit more depth.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s part of a set of circuits that are involved</p>
<p>in what are called go-no-go tasks.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t want to go into this</p>
<p>in a lot of detail right now</p>
<p>because it would take us too far down the rabbit hole</p>
<p>of neural circuitry.</p>
<p>But basically in terms of behaviors,</p>
<p>we both have DPO type behaviors,</p>
<p>so decision-making reward-based behaviors,</p>
<p>and we have habits that we learn and we acquire</p>
<p>and then we just start to execute reflexively.</p>
<p>Things like walking, things like yawning when we&rsquo;re tired,</p>
<p>things like taking a particular route</p>
<p>through the parking lot, right?</p>
<p>We learn that the first time we go to a given parking lot</p>
<p>and walk into a building,</p>
<p>but after that we tend to follow the exact same trajectory.</p>
<p>It becomes very automatized.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like we just do it without thinking.</p>
<p>Well, the go-no-go circuitry</p>
<p>is another aspect of our behavior</p>
<p>where we both have to select behaviors to perform</p>
<p>and we have to select behaviors to suppress.</p>
<p>And the anorexic brain seems to reward suppression</p>
<p>of one set of behaviors, ingestion of high calorie foods,</p>
<p>and to reward focus or even hyper-focus</p>
<p>and consumption of low-fat, low-calorie foods.</p>
<p>So this homeostatic process that we learn about</p>
<p>from like high school onward,</p>
<p>that, oh, everything in your body is designed</p>
<p>to keep everything in balance.</p>
<p>You stay awake for a certain amount of time,</p>
<p>you want to sleep.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t eat for a while,</p>
<p>then you want to eat to maintain weight, right?</p>
<p>You eat too much, then you want to eat less.</p>
<p>Those systems are disrupted.</p>
<p>And so what&rsquo;s so beautiful about this work</p>
<p>from the Columbia group is that what it says is</p>
<p>the place to intervene has to be the habit.</p>
<p>This stuff has already passed through all the learning.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s passed through all the reward systems.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s clearly not being overrun</p>
<p>by the homeostatic processes of the body.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s very little body fat.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no leptin.</p>
<p>Whatever neurons in the brain respond to leptin</p>
<p>are starved for leptin.</p>
<p>Periods have shut down.</p>
<p>Sperm production and testosterone is lowered.</p>
<p>Bone density is down.</p>
<p>Clearly, this is overriding all those homeostatic processes,</p>
<p>all the signals that would say, eat, eat, eat.</p>
<p>Those don&rsquo;t matter in the brain of the anorexic.</p>
<p>The brain of the anorexic is just performing habits</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re being rewarded for it.</p>
<p>So when you come along and say,</p>
<p>look, you should really eat this whole pie</p>
<p>or this whole pizza, you&rsquo;ll feel better.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s actually aversive to them.</p>
<p>So since it appears to be a habit,</p>
<p>a reflex that&rsquo;s perpetuating the anorexic phenotype,</p>
<p>as we say in science,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s perpetuating anorexia in this individual</p>
<p>and telling them about all this terrible stuff</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s happening in their body won&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>Taking them away from all the images</p>
<p>of thin people online, et cetera, that&rsquo;s not going to work.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s going to work?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s going to work is intervening in the neural circuitry</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s related to the habit itself.</p>
<p>And it turns out that there are ways to do that.</p>
<p>So how do you break a habit?</p>
<p>How do you rewire the brain circuitry</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s literally causing a reflex?</p>
<p>And in this case, causing a reflex</p>
<p>that is killing the individual,</p>
<p>or at least leading to very bad health outcomes.</p>
<p>The way that you do that is through a cognitive mechanism</p>
<p>where you teach the individual</p>
<p>what is leading up to the habit.</p>
<p>This is a little bit similar to the way</p>
<p>that somebody who suffers from addiction</p>
<p>starts to put in different constraint type behaviors.</p>
<p>Constraint type behaviors are the sorts of things</p>
<p>like where the alcoholic will call a hotel ahead of time</p>
<p>and say, listen, I want the minibar taken out of the room.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want a television in the room, et cetera.</p>
<p>Constraint type behaviors.</p>
<p>Those are really ways of keeping oneself</p>
<p>from the temptation.</p>
<p>But with these habits,</p>
<p>they work at such a subconscious level</p>
<p>that what seems to work best is a combination</p>
<p>of teaching the individual about their internal state</p>
<p>and how to register their internal state.</p>
<p>What we call interoception,</p>
<p>this ability to perceive your internal state</p>
<p>so that they can start to learn to associate</p>
<p>the interactions with different types of food</p>
<p>with the sorts of cues that are occurring within their body,</p>
<p>quickening of heart rate, hyperacuity of focus</p>
<p>that we talked about earlier.</p>
<p>Once they start to be able to notice</p>
<p>that those things are happening,</p>
<p>then they can start to intervene.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about what those things are</p>
<p>that lead into a habit,</p>
<p>because those turn out to be the exact points of entry</p>
<p>for changing and eliminating and rewiring habits</p>
<p>toward more healthy behaviors.</p>
<p>And I should highlight that this isn&rsquo;t just about</p>
<p>rewiring habits for sake of the anorexic.</p>
<p>These are also the same types of mechanisms</p>
<p>that one would want to incorporate</p>
<p>in order to rewire any habit of any kind.</p>
<p>There are two main features of thinking</p>
<p>that go into the sorts of habits that anorexics execute.</p>
<p>The first is something called weak central coherence.</p>
<p>Weak central coherence is essentially an inability</p>
<p>to see the forest through the trees.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a hyperacuity and focus on details</p>
<p>within a given environment.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s actually an interesting probe test for anorexia</p>
<p>that involves something akin to kind of a</p>
<p>where&rsquo;s Waldo type puzzle,</p>
<p>where an image is put up.</p>
<p>The one that I saw was one in which</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a big array of coffee beans.</p>
<p>Actually, they&rsquo;re all brown coffee beans.</p>
<p>And your job is to identify where in that array</p>
<p>of coffee beans there&rsquo;s a face.</p>
<p>And indeed there&rsquo;s a face embedded in there.</p>
<p>It looks a little bit like a coffee bean,</p>
<p>but once you see it, you realize it&rsquo;s a face,</p>
<p>not a coffee bean.</p>
<p>And it becomes very hard to not notice the face after that.</p>
<p>Anorexics are very good at identifying the face.</p>
<p>They find it much faster than do non-anorexics,</p>
<p>which is really interesting, right?</p>
<p>They somehow are able to home in on details</p>
<p>and find those details and fixate on those details.</p>
<p>Now, eventually most, if not all people find the face,</p>
<p>but once you do what you will find</p>
<p>and what everyone finds is that you can&rsquo;t unfind the face.</p>
<p>It just jumps out.</p>
<p>So what essentially you&rsquo;ve lost is the ability</p>
<p>to see the whole picture,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s some detail within that picture</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re obsessed by.</p>
<p>So this has kind of elements</p>
<p>of obsessive compulsive disorder,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not really obsessive compulsive disorder per se.</p>
<p>So we call that weak central coherence.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a hyperacuity on one particular feature.</p>
<p>You miss the big picture.</p>
<p>The other is a challenge in set shifting</p>
<p>that once you identify something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a particular interest</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s driving some sort of reward for the anorexic,</p>
<p>that would be identifying the high fat foods</p>
<p>or identifying the one food on the table</p>
<p>that one could eat without anyone hopefully noticing</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re eating just the green beans</p>
<p>and not touching any of the other food.</p>
<p>If you ever had a meal with an anorexic,</p>
<p>you might be familiar with this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of uncomfortable to be around actually.</p>
<p>They go through a lot of elaborate procedures</p>
<p>to kind of hide food,</p>
<p>to they&rsquo;ll sometimes even chew food,</p>
<p>hold it in their mouth,</p>
<p>and then go to the bathroom and discard it.</p>
<p>Things very elaborate,</p>
<p>very troubling types of things to hear about</p>
<p>and to be around,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;ll notice that they push food</p>
<p>around their plate a lot.</p>
<p>They become masterful actually</p>
<p>at trying to keep people&rsquo;s awareness away</p>
<p>from what they&rsquo;re doing,</p>
<p>which is to home in on these low fat, low calorie foods.</p>
<p>And they can&rsquo;t seem to set shift.</p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t just relax and enjoy the meal</p>
<p>because the meal for them is essentially</p>
<p>like this where&rsquo;s Waldo</p>
<p>or find the face in the coffee bean task.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re constantly monitoring</p>
<p>how much people are observing them</p>
<p>and trying to navigate this,</p>
<p>what would otherwise be a really pleasant circumstance</p>
<p>for most people.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re trying to navigate through this</p>
<p>because remember for them,</p>
<p>the reward is in the avoidance of certain things</p>
<p>and the acquiring of only the foods</p>
<p>that their brain rewards them for</p>
<p>because those are the foods</p>
<p>that have been pre-selected in our now habit.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s amazing and frankly also important</p>
<p>are these findings that once you teach anorexics</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s happening to them,</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re doing this,</p>
<p>they are able to intervene.</p>
<p>Now they need support, right?</p>
<p>And another form of therapy</p>
<p>that seems to work well for anorexics</p>
<p>that ideally is combined with this habit rewiring</p>
<p>is a family-based model.</p>
<p>Family-based models are starting to surface a lot now</p>
<p>in various therapy settings.</p>
<p>Therapy-based models in short</p>
<p>are basically where the entire family</p>
<p>is made aware of the individual&rsquo;s challenges</p>
<p>with a particular eating disorder or other disorder.</p>
<p>And in understanding some of the biology</p>
<p>and psychology around it,</p>
<p>they stop condemning the individual.</p>
<p>They start to support that individual</p>
<p>through cuing them towards their own habits</p>
<p>that they observe.</p>
<p>They give them some autonomy.</p>
<p>They realize that none of this changes overnight</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re taught about things like neuroplasticity</p>
<p>and the ability to change one&rsquo;s brain</p>
<p>in response to experience.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s a whole internal support network.</p>
<p>Now for people that live alone,</p>
<p>this isn&rsquo;t available to them.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t the kind of thing</p>
<p>that you share with your coworkers.</p>
<p>You might involve a close friend or a spouse</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not the sort of thing</p>
<p>that people that don&rsquo;t live in a family context</p>
<p>can really benefit from.</p>
<p>All of these things fall under the umbrella</p>
<p>of cognitive behavioral therapy.</p>
<p>And I should mention that cognitive behavioral therapies</p>
<p>are often done in conjunction with pharmacologic therapies.</p>
<p>I think that there&rsquo;s this idea out there</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s either or when often it&rsquo;s both.</p>
<p>So cognitive behavioral therapies are often combined</p>
<p>with this habit recognition and rewiring approach</p>
<p>which is starting to become more and more common.</p>
<p>And I think the data on it look really good</p>
<p>that especially when individuals are taught this early</p>
<p>in adolescence that there are positive outcomes over time.</p>
<p>The relapse rate of anorexia is quite high.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about 50% of individuals will relapse at some point</p>
<p>often triggered by a stressful life circumstance.</p>
<p>But the combination of cognitive behavioral therapy</p>
<p>that includes this family model</p>
<p>or at least habit reformation seems to be fairly effective.</p>
<p>And at present might be the most effective treatment.</p>
<p>Now there are additional treatments starting to surface</p>
<p>and that takes us into the realm of chemical treatments</p>
<p>for anorexia.</p>
<p>And I just want to mention that there are clinical trials</p>
<p>meaning legal clinical trials being done</p>
<p>at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine</p>
<p>by Matthew Johnson and others,</p>
<p>exploring how drugs like MDMA,</p>
<p>which increases dopamine and serotonin to very high levels</p>
<p>or psilocybin, so-called magic mushrooms</p>
<p>which increases serotonin and other compounds</p>
<p>to very high levels within the confines</p>
<p>of a professionally supported therapeutic environment</p>
<p>can help people rewire their brain</p>
<p>such that they can get relief from major depression</p>
<p>and various forms of trauma.</p>
<p>And now eating disorders are also being explored</p>
<p>in the context of MDMA and psilocybin clinical trials.</p>
<p>I do want to emphasize that those are clinical trials</p>
<p>that those compounds are not yet legal.</p>
<p>And in many cases, most cases they are still illegal.</p>
<p>I do not think that they should be explored</p>
<p>without a properly trained medical doctor</p>
<p>that the clinical trials are essential to complete</p>
<p>before one explores those compounds in particular</p>
<p>because lately I get a lot of emails about these compounds,</p>
<p>people telling me that they&rsquo;ve had amazing experiences</p>
<p>and relief from various things, not just eating disorders</p>
<p>but depression, et cetera.</p>
<p>However, I get an equal number of emails</p>
<p>from people saying that they worked</p>
<p>with some self-appointed guide.</p>
<p>This would be outside the clinical trials</p>
<p>I was referring to.</p>
<p>And they are now experiencing chronic visual snow.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re getting genuine visual field deficits.</p>
<p>They are having ticks that they never had before.</p>
<p>They have chronic insomnia.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not passing judgment on any of these compounds</p>
<p>or the people that are doing this sort of thing.</p>
<p>I just want to see the clinical data.</p>
<p>And I do believe that we should wait</p>
<p>until these clinical trials are done</p>
<p>before people start approaching this stuff.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because they are serious compounds.</p>
<p>They can open plasticity, but whether or not they work</p>
<p>quote unquote for different types of eating disorders</p>
<p>or depression and trauma, the data are looking promising</p>
<p>but that the clinical trials are still not done.</p>
<p>And I know a number of people are going out of the U.S.</p>
<p>and into other countries where this stuff</p>
<p>is being done more regularly.</p>
<p>And there too, I&rsquo;ve gotten reports back</p>
<p>of people doing so-called ibogaine treatments.</p>
<p>Some of you who are familiar with eating disorders</p>
<p>will immediately be asking, well, what about ibogaine?</p>
<p>Does it work?</p>
<p>Does it work?</p>
<p>Well, the clinical trials in this country are not complete.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard evidence direct.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard directly from people who have benefited</p>
<p>from the sorts of things for treatment of eating disorders.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ve also heard of people that have developed</p>
<p>chronic seizure disorders from pursuing things</p>
<p>like ibogaine for the treatment of eating disorders.</p>
<p>So again, I&rsquo;m not passing judgment.</p>
<p>I would just like to see more data.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s very important that the safety,</p>
<p>aspects of safety be in place.</p>
<p>So this is definitely not something to get renegade about.</p>
<p>So it appears that once anorexia is established</p>
<p>that habit breaking through self-awareness</p>
<p>of what the habits are is going to be a primary entry point.</p>
<p>That might seem kind of trivial.</p>
<p>You might say, well, couldn&rsquo;t you have just told us</p>
<p>that in one sentence?</p>
<p>But I want to return us to this model</p>
<p>about homeostatic processes, reward processes, et cetera.</p>
<p>That leads us to a place where the short answer is no.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t simply say break the habit.</p>
<p>An individual needs to be informed</p>
<p>about where that habit comes from.</p>
<p>And the fact that what currently seems like</p>
<p>a rewarded habit should actually be a punished habit.</p>
<p>Now I don&rsquo;t mean by actual punishment,</p>
<p>but what I mean is within the brain,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s been a switch and the anorexic</p>
<p>needs to learn that there&rsquo;s been a switch</p>
<p>such that what should be rewarding is now punished.</p>
<p>And what should be punished, starvation is now rewarded.</p>
<p>The beauty of being a human being</p>
<p>is that knowledge of knowledge</p>
<p>can allow you to make better decisions.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll say that again.</p>
<p>The beauty of being a human being</p>
<p>is that knowledge of knowledge</p>
<p>can allow you to make better decisions.</p>
<p>Now, of course, when we are anxious, when we are tired,</p>
<p>when we are intoxicated,</p>
<p>we have less access to that ability</p>
<p>to use knowledge of knowledge to intervene.</p>
<p>The anorexic will often do things</p>
<p>that are in keeping with their habits,</p>
<p>such as over-exercising.</p>
<p>This is a area that anyone who&rsquo;s treated anorexics</p>
<p>or interacted with anorexics is well aware of</p>
<p>that they are constantly moving.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re constantly on the treadmill.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re constantly running.</p>
<p>They always want to be moving and burning calories</p>
<p>so that they can feel okay about interacting with food</p>
<p>or because they have the distorted body image.</p>
<p>Well, does breaking a habit mean</p>
<p>that they should stop moving around and exercising?</p>
<p>No, not necessarily.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some really interesting studies</p>
<p>that show that shifting anorexics towards activities</p>
<p>that, for instance, build muscle resistance training</p>
<p>and allow them to eat a bit more food</p>
<p>without necessarily losing weight,</p>
<p>but rather to put more muscle on their body</p>
<p>can actually be beneficial.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;m not talking about anorexics becoming bodybuilders.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a whole body dysmorphia</p>
<p>associated with bodybuilding,</p>
<p>but certain forms of exercise are just catabolic,</p>
<p>meaning they break down the amount of muscle.</p>
<p>They reduce body weight overall.</p>
<p>Other types of exercises like resistance training</p>
<p>are anabolic.</p>
<p>They allow muscle to be put on.</p>
<p>And there are some interesting studies,</p>
<p>not a lot, but some interesting studies</p>
<p>trying to encourage anorexics not to stop exercising,</p>
<p>but rather to stop exercising in this neurotic,</p>
<p>catabolic way of breaking oneself down,</p>
<p>but rather getting them shifted toward breaking habits</p>
<p>of only approaching low-calorie, low-fat foods,</p>
<p>while also encouraging them to embark on resistance training</p>
<p>and to start to learn and reward the relationship</p>
<p>between exercise for sake of making one&rsquo;s body strong,</p>
<p>including the bones, not just the muscles,</p>
<p>but the bones, which is important, especially in anorexics,</p>
<p>and then to see food as a way to nourish that process</p>
<p>to building a body that could be of the stable weight.</p>
<p>Hopefully, once the anorexic is of a healthy weight</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re maintaining that weight,</p>
<p>but that they don&rsquo;t have to constantly be on this treadmill,</p>
<p>no pun intended,</p>
<p>of balancing whatever food intake they have with activity.</p>
<p>And along the lines of that,</p>
<p>during the episode on fat loss and metabolism as well,</p>
<p>I talked about this neat</p>
<p>and non-exercise-induced thermogenesis,</p>
<p>where people who tend to be thin,</p>
<p>tend to bounce around a lot, they&rsquo;re kind of fidgety,</p>
<p>and that burns thousands of calories a day,</p>
<p>anywhere from 800 to 2,000 calories a day.</p>
<p>Now, that can be beneficial for the folks</p>
<p>that are overweight and have a healthy mindset about food,</p>
<p>but are trying to lose weight,</p>
<p>and it turns out that by literally fidgeting</p>
<p>and bouncing around, like, this is why I&rsquo;m doing this,</p>
<p>it looks ridiculous,</p>
<p>you actually burn a lot of body fat and calories</p>
<p>that way, provided you&rsquo;re in a caloric deficit,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll burn body fat,</p>
<p>because body fat is not just a passive tissue,</p>
<p>it actually receives input from neurons</p>
<p>that release noradrenaline and adrenaline,</p>
<p>and this neat has been described for several decades now,</p>
<p>and it actually is a pretty terrific way</p>
<p>to burn off more calories.</p>
<p>So with the anorexic, you actually want to encourage them</p>
<p>to not constantly be trying to burn off calories.</p>
<p>That can be very challenging,</p>
<p>so shifting them toward activities,</p>
<p>like weight-bearing activities or resistance training,</p>
<p>that promote this more anabolic type of relationship</p>
<p>to activity, as opposed to catabolic, can be beneficial.</p>
<p>Before we move on to talking about bulimia</p>
<p>and some related disorders,</p>
<p>I want to talk about an aspect of anorexia</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s very interesting, quite troubling, in fact,</p>
<p>but that has received a lot of attention,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s the distorted self-image.</p>
<p>Now, in the episode on depression,</p>
<p>we talked about a very powerful aspect of major depression,</p>
<p>which is this anti-self-confabulation,</p>
<p>that people who are depressed seem to genuinely believe</p>
<p>and even confabulate about the fact</p>
<p>that they are performing poorly in life</p>
<p>and that they are no good or worthless, et cetera.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s literally a lie that they believe,</p>
<p>and their statements and their feelings and their behaviors</p>
<p>start to reflect that lie.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not conscious of it,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why we call it a confabulation.</p>
<p>Anorexics often will see themselves as overweight</p>
<p>or imperfect in ways that are of an obsession for them.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll think, oh, you know,</p>
<p>their arms are a little bit fat, you know,</p>
<p>or, you know, the contour of their face makes,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t like the pictures of themselves,</p>
<p>or they, what I&rsquo;m describing here</p>
<p>is actually pretty typical behavior of a lot of people.</p>
<p>I mean, how many people do you know</p>
<p>that after you take a picture of them,</p>
<p>they say, can I see the picture?</p>
<p>And then they tell you that you have to throw it away.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean they&rsquo;re anorexic</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;re suffering from some sort of disorder.</p>
<p>That just means that they&rsquo;re a human being</p>
<p>that cares about how they appear in the world.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not here to judge that.</p>
<p>In the case of the anorexic,</p>
<p>the problem seems to be that they have a genuine distortion</p>
<p>of their self-image,</p>
<p>so much so that they don&rsquo;t actually see themselves</p>
<p>accurately, their visual perceptions are off.</p>
<p>And the reason we know this</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s because of some really important</p>
<p>and beautiful studies that were done</p>
<p>in my colleague, Jeremy Balenson&rsquo;s lab at Stanford.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s in the department of communications.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s actually collaborated with a Dr. Halpern</p>
<p>that I mentioned earlier.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s really interesting about these studies</p>
<p>is they give us a window into the perceptual defect</p>
<p>that anorexics have.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve actually done one of these experiments.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m fortunate to not be anorexic,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve done some work with the VR lab over there.</p>
<p>And what you get to do is you get to adjust</p>
<p>this avatar of yourself to the point where you think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s as accurate as it could possibly be.</p>
<p>And anorexics really distort this avatar.</p>
<p>In other words, they create this serious mismatch</p>
<p>between their perception of themselves and the reality.</p>
<p>So indeed, it does seem to be the case.</p>
<p>Now, what&rsquo;s relieving, or I should say,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s encouraging about some of the therapies</p>
<p>that we talked about before, the family-based model,</p>
<p>the cognitive behavioral treatments, yes,</p>
<p>and the drug treatments as well,</p>
<p>but this habit intervention model</p>
<p>is that as one starts to shift those things,</p>
<p>it does appear that the perception of self seems to follow,</p>
<p>that the perception of self seems to shift</p>
<p>along with the change in habits.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a relief, at least I find that reassuring</p>
<p>because changing one&rsquo;s perception is actually very hard.</p>
<p>As somebody who&rsquo;s worked almost his entire career</p>
<p>on visual perception and related things,</p>
<p>the perceptual apparati of the brain</p>
<p>are not very amenable to neuroplasticity.</p>
<p>I mean, they don&rsquo;t change that easily.</p>
<p>Whereas it appears that the circuitry</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s related to habit formation and decision-making</p>
<p>and the reward circuitry, that stuff can be rewired.</p>
<p>And so anorexics, as they progress out</p>
<p>of their anorexic state into one</p>
<p>which they are intervening in their reflexes,</p>
<p>gaining better habits around food,</p>
<p>eating more, more accurately assessing foods</p>
<p>and environments that they&rsquo;re in related to food.</p>
<p>As they change their behavior</p>
<p>and they start to put on healthy weight,</p>
<p>maybe they&rsquo;re also doing the sorts of exercises</p>
<p>that allow them to put on healthy weight</p>
<p>and avoiding kind of extreme exercises of catabolism</p>
<p>and breaking themselves down.</p>
<p>They also managed to somehow,</p>
<p>just as a consequence of all that,</p>
<p>rewire their perception of self.</p>
<p>So it doesn&rsquo;t seem that trying to tell someone,</p>
<p>oh my gosh, you&rsquo;re so thin, you really need to eat,</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t seem to work.</p>
<p>They just don&rsquo;t see themselves the same way</p>
<p>that you see them.</p>
<p>And so I offer that as a point of consideration,</p>
<p>if you know someone that&rsquo;s anorexic</p>
<p>or if you look at an anorexic and you think,</p>
<p>how is it that they are still critical</p>
<p>of the small, even non-existent amount of body fat</p>
<p>on their triceps or something, how is that?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s literally that their brain,</p>
<p>as it relates to perceptions,</p>
<p>visual perceptions in particular,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re completely off.</p>
<p>And fortunately by changing habits,</p>
<p>you rewire those circuits as well.</p>
<p>Okay, so let&rsquo;s talk about bulimia,</p>
<p>which is overeating and then purging,</p>
<p>typically by self-induced vomiting</p>
<p>or by ingestion of laxatives,</p>
<p>sometimes also in concert with people taking stimulants</p>
<p>and fat burners and over-ingestion of stimulants</p>
<p>to try and burn off more energy.</p>
<p>And then we&rsquo;ll also talk about binge eating disorder,</p>
<p>which has a lot of the same features as bulimia,</p>
<p>but typically no purging.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to list off all the clinical criteria</p>
<p>that would allow someone to be diagnosed</p>
<p>as bulimic or binge eating disorder,</p>
<p>but the general features are that they ingest</p>
<p>far more calories than they need,</p>
<p>anywhere from 10 to 30 times their daily caloric intake,</p>
<p>oftentimes within a two-hour period,</p>
<p>which is just a staggering amount of food and nutrients</p>
<p>in a short period of time.</p>
<p>Oftentimes they&rsquo;re overriding those mechanical signals</p>
<p>from the body that they&rsquo;re full.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a really troubling thing to think about,</p>
<p>but people are literally gorging themselves with food.</p>
<p>This looks a lot like a laboratory animal</p>
<p>that has these AGRP neurons stimulated,</p>
<p>these neurons that will eat until they almost burst</p>
<p>or burst.</p>
<p>So you wonder, is it these AGRP neurons that are active?</p>
<p>Almost certainly, yes, that they&rsquo;re involved.</p>
<p>Although I don&rsquo;t think that that&rsquo;s going to be</p>
<p>the major point of intervention.</p>
<p>Pat, we&rsquo;re going to talk about other types of interventions.</p>
<p>There are a number of clinical criteria.</p>
<p>For instance, if somebody has one of these binges</p>
<p>once a year, does that make them bulimic?</p>
<p>Technically, no,</p>
<p>but I certainly don&rsquo;t recommend people do this.</p>
<p>If you are one of these people</p>
<p>who has so-called cheat days, right?</p>
<p>Some of you may be familiar with cheat days.</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;re a little less common now,</p>
<p>but the idea is you eat clean for six days</p>
<p>or five days a week or two weeks,</p>
<p>and then you have a so-called cheat day</p>
<p>where you just kind of go wild</p>
<p>and eat whatever you want in whatever volumes.</p>
<p>Is that bulimia?</p>
<p>Has some of the contour of bulimia,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re vomiting afterwards or binge eating disorder,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>Does it constitute full-blown bulimia</p>
<p>or binge eating disorder?</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s pretty hard to say.</p>
<p>The criteria that were described to me</p>
<p>is that if somebody is doing this at least once a month</p>
<p>over a period of anywhere from two to three months,</p>
<p>then it likely would qualify.</p>
<p>And I certainly know people who do these cheat days.</p>
<p>And by those criteria,</p>
<p>they have something like binge eating disorder.</p>
<p>But in general, one of the hallmark features</p>
<p>of bulimia and binge eating disorder</p>
<p>is that people are unable to control their eating.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just simply,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not making the decision to have a cheat day.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not making the decision to overeat.</p>
<p>They are simply driven from the inside</p>
<p>without question by way of neural circuitry.</p>
<p>They are driven from the inside</p>
<p>to ingest far more food than they need.</p>
<p>And in some cases than they would want to eat.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a lot like the habit</p>
<p>that we described for anorexia.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like it&rsquo;s turned into a reflex</p>
<p>once they get going.</p>
<p>All the homeostatic signals are being overridden.</p>
<p>All the signals from the body,</p>
<p>the leptin, the insulin, the glucose,</p>
<p>all that stuff is cosmically sky high.</p>
<p>And yet they&rsquo;re just what we,</p>
<p>you know, the nerds call hyperphagic.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just eating like crazy.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s going on there?</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;ve been a lot of ideas,</p>
<p>you know, about why this arises.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the so-called thyroid hormone hypothesis.</p>
<p>That one&rsquo;s a tricky one.</p>
<p>It turns out that cortisol</p>
<p>and thyroid hormone concentrations vary</p>
<p>according to when the binge purge happened.</p>
<p>So there were some studies</p>
<p>that looked at thyroid hormone levels</p>
<p>and they found elevated thyroid hormone levels.</p>
<p>Thyroid hormone is involved in metabolism</p>
<p>and not just the burning of energy,</p>
<p>but the use of energy</p>
<p>in converting it to different tissues of the body,</p>
<p>cartilage, bone, fat, and muscle, et cetera.</p>
<p>Did a whole episode on thyroid and growth hormone,</p>
<p>by the way, if you&rsquo;re interested</p>
<p>in learning more about thyroid hormone.</p>
<p>But thyroid hormone can also be depleted</p>
<p>at other phases of the binge purge cycle.</p>
<p>Now, without listing off all the terrible things</p>
<p>that happen with this binge purge cycle,</p>
<p>there are a number of things</p>
<p>that are really worth pointing out.</p>
<p>One is that the vomiting itself,</p>
<p>the use of laxatives,</p>
<p>that can cause severe disruption to the mucosal lining,</p>
<p>the mucus lining of the digestive tract</p>
<p>can severely disrupt the gut microbiome.</p>
<p>It can cause all sorts of,</p>
<p>even ulceration of the esophagus</p>
<p>and just really terrible stuff.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of shame associated with bulimia,</p>
<p>oftentimes because people are vomiting</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s hard to hide that vomiting behavior.</p>
<p>People are aware of it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some social isolation.</p>
<p>So you recall from the beginning,</p>
<p>it does not appear that sexual trauma</p>
<p>is a prerequisite for bulimia,</p>
<p>although sometimes it can occur.</p>
<p>The hallmark feature of bulimia</p>
<p>that distinguishes it from anorexia,</p>
<p>aside from the fact that it&rsquo;s overeating</p>
<p>as opposed to undereating,</p>
<p>is a lack of what they call inhibitory control.</p>
<p>And that might come as no surprise,</p>
<p>but first of all,</p>
<p>the bulimic, unlike the anorexic,</p>
<p>is hyper impulsive</p>
<p>and oftentimes has other types of impulse behaviors.</p>
<p>They might have a little bit of alcohol</p>
<p>and then start to eat like crazy,</p>
<p>whereas normally they&rsquo;re very restrictive.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a common feature of bulimia.</p>
<p>Sometimes they over-ingest alcohol during these binges.</p>
<p>Sometimes they are sexually promiscuous, not always,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a general issue with satiety</p>
<p>once they start eating and with impulse control generally.</p>
<p>And for that reason,</p>
<p>many of the treatments that you see for bulimia</p>
<p>and binge eating disorder</p>
<p>are the sorts of treatments that don&rsquo;t seem to work so well,</p>
<p>or at least most of the time for anorexia.</p>
<p>So the drugs that increase the neuromodulator serotonin,</p>
<p>for instance, fluoxetine,</p>
<p>also called Prozac, Paxil, et cetera,</p>
<p>those things oftentimes can be effective in bulimia.</p>
<p>Some of the drugs that are used to treat</p>
<p>attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and ADD,</p>
<p>a topic that we&rsquo;re going to talk about in depth</p>
<p>here on the podcast soon,</p>
<p>some of those same drugs like Adderall,</p>
<p>Vyvanse and things of that sort</p>
<p>can also be used to treat bulimia and binge eating disorder.</p>
<p>Why would that work?</p>
<p>Well, now you are familiar with the prefrontal cortex.</p>
<p>You probably know more about prefrontal cortex</p>
<p>than you ever wanted to.</p>
<p>Just from this episode,</p>
<p>prefrontal cortex is involved in this analysis</p>
<p>of duration, path and outcome.</p>
<p>Duration, path and outcome is how we avoid impulsivity.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s how we think, okay, if this, then that,</p>
<p>if that, then this.</p>
<p>You can imagine how for the obsessive compulsive</p>
<p>or for the anorexic,</p>
<p>these are circuits that are overactive.</p>
<p>For the bulimic,</p>
<p>this is the circuit that&rsquo;s going to essentially</p>
<p>be underactive and is under conditions</p>
<p>where they think, oh, you know,</p>
<p>I shouldn&rsquo;t eat anything, I shouldn&rsquo;t eat anything.</p>
<p>And then they just tear the refrigerator open</p>
<p>and plow through that.</p>
<p>And then at that point,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re plowing through the cupboards</p>
<p>and then they&rsquo;re ordering food.</p>
<p>And then they&rsquo;re feeling horrible about themselves.</p>
<p>There do tend to be these cycles of binge and purge</p>
<p>followed by feelings of real shame</p>
<p>because they just can&rsquo;t control their behavior.</p>
<p>And what is more embarrassing</p>
<p>than not being able to control one&rsquo;s behavior</p>
<p>as an adult or as a young adult?</p>
<p>So really the polar opposite of what you see in anorexia.</p>
<p>So this lack of impulsivity implies a lack</p>
<p>of prefrontal control, what we call top-down control.</p>
<p>Why do we call it top-down?</p>
<p>Because the prefrontal cortex is suppressing the activity</p>
<p>of deeper limbic and hypothalamic circuitry</p>
<p>and things of that sort.</p>
<p>Anytime you feel like you want to say something</p>
<p>really offensive and you don&rsquo;t, that&rsquo;s top-down control.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s your prefrontal cortex.</p>
<p>Anytime someone says something and you grit your teeth</p>
<p>because you know you shouldn&rsquo;t say anything,</p>
<p>gritting your teeth is top-down control, okay?</p>
<p>When you explode or burst or say the wrong thing</p>
<p>or say the thing that you shouldn&rsquo;t say</p>
<p>or do the thing you shouldn&rsquo;t do,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s lack of prefrontal control.</p>
<p>And indeed people who have frontotemporal dementia</p>
<p>due to aging or head injuries see this a lot</p>
<p>and people who play sports,</p>
<p>they get a lot of frontal damage.</p>
<p>They become more impulsive.</p>
<p>So bulimics have an issue with impulsivity</p>
<p>and therefore drugs that can increase serotonin</p>
<p>and sometimes these drugs that increase dopamine</p>
<p>and adrenaline, also called epinephrine,</p>
<p>will increase the tone, as we call it,</p>
<p>the dopaminergic tone or the, it&rsquo;s called adrenergic,</p>
<p>but norepinephrine levels in the brain</p>
<p>allow for more top-down control.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s also why they&rsquo;re used to treat ADHD</p>
<p>and attention deficit disorder.</p>
<p>They tend to create a hyper-focus.</p>
<p>They tend to push the brain into,</p>
<p>these drugs tend to create a hyper-focus</p>
<p>and tend to push the brain</p>
<p>and general mode of processing into one</p>
<p>in which you think, if this, then that,</p>
<p>if this, then that.</p>
<p>So anticipating outcomes.</p>
<p>And for that reason, drugs like Welbutrin, bupreiron,</p>
<p>which is an antidepressant,</p>
<p>which mainly increases the amount of dopamine</p>
<p>and norepinephrine and less so serotonin,</p>
<p>that can also be effective</p>
<p>for certain types of binge eating disorder,</p>
<p>is actually used to treat smoking,</p>
<p>for promoting smoking cessation and for depression,</p>
<p>but also for certain forms of obesity</p>
<p>related to binge eating disorder.</p>
<p>And the data are pretty good.</p>
<p>And there are timed release forms of this</p>
<p>and non-timed release forms.</p>
<p>And I think you have to consult with a psychiatrist</p>
<p>in order to get these prescribed</p>
<p>because they are prescription drugs,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a very different constellation of neurochemicals</p>
<p>and brain areas and approaches for bulimia.</p>
<p>The treatment of binge eating disorder</p>
<p>has been explored from a new standpoint recently.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the work of this now, sadly,</p>
<p>former colleague of mine, Dr. Casey Halpern,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s at University of Pennsylvania</p>
<p>that I mentioned earlier.</p>
<p>They are using deep brain stimulation</p>
<p>in order to treat binge eating disorder.</p>
<p>Now, why deep brain stimulation?</p>
<p>Well, work from Dr. Halpern and others while at Stanford</p>
<p>showed that there are particular patterns of brain activity</p>
<p>in both the prefrontal cortex,</p>
<p>but also in an area of the brain</p>
<p>called the nucleus accumbens,</p>
<p>very important and very relevant area of the brain</p>
<p>in this context.</p>
<p>And in any discussion about motivated behaviors</p>
<p>of any kind, feeding, sex, drug-related behavior,</p>
<p>people who exercise compulsively,</p>
<p>the nucleus accumbens is in a ongoing dialogue</p>
<p>with the prefrontal cortex.</p>
<p>And the nucleus accumbens has no mind of its own,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s associated with dopamine release.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s part of this so-called reward pathway.</p>
<p>And what Dr. Halpern and colleagues discovered</p>
<p>is that there are particular patterns of activity</p>
<p>that ripple through the brain</p>
<p>through these prefrontal networks</p>
<p>and through this nucleus accumbens area.</p>
<p>Those areas are connected.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called delta oscillations,</p>
<p>delta just being a particular frequency</p>
<p>of electrical activity.</p>
<p>For you aficionados is one to four Hertz activity.</p>
<p>But in any case, those delta oscillations</p>
<p>in the nucleus accumbens are associated with food reward</p>
<p>in both mice and humans.</p>
<p>Somehow this reverberatory activity</p>
<p>creates a perception in the individual</p>
<p>that food is hyper rewarding.</p>
<p>Now that&rsquo;s interesting and has allowed them</p>
<p>to use a targeted deep brain stimulation approach</p>
<p>to treat binge eating disorder.</p>
<p>And this deep brain stimulation</p>
<p>is appearing to be an effective treatment.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s still more studies that need to be done.</p>
<p>Actually, if you think you have binge eating disorder,</p>
<p>you can find the criteria for that.</p>
<p>And you could contact Dr. Halpern.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s, as I mentioned,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s moving to University of Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>They are recruiting patients for these studies all the time.</p>
<p>The studies are fairly invasive.</p>
<p>They involve a FDA approved approach</p>
<p>of literally placing a wire down into an area of the brain</p>
<p>that then allows the individual</p>
<p>to stimulate a particular brain area</p>
<p>to offset some of these activity patterns</p>
<p>that lead to a elevated sense of reward</p>
<p>from food and binge eating.</p>
<p>And the data look really promising.</p>
<p>Now I realize that&rsquo;s a very invasive approach.</p>
<p>Not everybody is going to be willing</p>
<p>to have this wire inserted into the brain.</p>
<p>But for people that suffer from binge eating disorder,</p>
<p>this is a great and very exciting potential treatment.</p>
<p>Because what I didn&rsquo;t tell you</p>
<p>is that many people who have binge eating disorder</p>
<p>are obese to the point where their health</p>
<p>is greatly at risk.</p>
<p>Now, obesity causes all sorts of shifts</p>
<p>in the dialogue between the brain and body.</p>
<p>Some of which you&rsquo;ll recognize</p>
<p>from earlier in the discussion.</p>
<p>For instance, leptin signaling is disrupted.</p>
<p>So the fat, there&rsquo;s lots of body fat,</p>
<p>but even though that body fat</p>
<p>is secreting this hormone leptin</p>
<p>and that signal should shut down the desire to eat,</p>
<p>the receptors to leptin in the brain are totally screwed up.</p>
<p>And so the signal to eat is there,</p>
<p>but the signal to stop eating is not there.</p>
<p>So again, you have an accelerator and a brake</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like the accelerator is always pushed down.</p>
<p>Some of these brain stimulation approaches</p>
<p>seem to be able to bypass some of that.</p>
<p>And of course there are all the metabolic syndromes</p>
<p>and the problems with having excess levels of body fat,</p>
<p>things like insulin resistance, type two diabetes.</p>
<p>I mean, as disturbing as is to hear,</p>
<p>there are many individuals, actually,</p>
<p>I know some who are so obese</p>
<p>that they start getting bodily sores.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not just bed sores,</p>
<p>but they have skin sores that are very disruptive to them.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t like having these sores.</p>
<p>And in addition to that,</p>
<p>they can get peripheral neuropathies</p>
<p>because of some of these metabolic issues,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not getting enough utilization</p>
<p>of the nutrients in the tissue</p>
<p>because the way that insulin is disrupted,</p>
<p>insulin signaling,</p>
<p>and they actually have to have certain portions</p>
<p>of their limbs amputated,</p>
<p>and yet they continue to overeat.</p>
<p>So this is not an issue of self-control</p>
<p>that can easily be dealt with simply by telling the person,</p>
<p>look, you have to stop eating or you&rsquo;re going to die,</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re going to have your legs amputated.</p>
<p>Like with anorexia,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a distortion in the relationship to food,</p>
<p>but the homeostatic and the reward aspects are disrupted.</p>
<p>So unlike anorexia,</p>
<p>where it seems to be a habit-based mechanism</p>
<p>with bulimia and binge eating disorder,</p>
<p>something deep within the neural circuitry</p>
<p>is causing food to be hyper-attractive and the brake is off.</p>
<p>So if you want to develop some empathy</p>
<p>for what these people are dealing with, consider this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like driving a car.</p>
<p>You get onto a grade,</p>
<p>maybe a 10 or 15 degree grade,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re heading down and you figure,</p>
<p>well, you&rsquo;ll just pump the brakes a little bit,</p>
<p>but there is no brake, right?</p>
<p>So you start going faster and faster and faster,</p>
<p>and your only choice is to use the accelerator</p>
<p>or just to coast through it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s essentially what&rsquo;s happening to these neural circuits.</p>
<p>So the work of Dr. Halpern and others,</p>
<p>I think is really exciting.</p>
<p>And even though it&rsquo;s highly invasive,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s going to lead to not just some relief</p>
<p>for the patients that do get that deep brain stimulation,</p>
<p>but also the identification</p>
<p>of what sorts of receptors are present</p>
<p>in those brain areas that could help.</p>
<p>What that means is that once we understand</p>
<p>which brain areas are involved in the disorder</p>
<p>and we understand what receptors those brain areas express,</p>
<p>then there can start to be additional interventions</p>
<p>by way of non-invasive treatments,</p>
<p>things like drug treatments.</p>
<p>Do behavioral interventions work for bulimia?</p>
<p>In some cases, yes,</p>
<p>provided that those interventions are done early enough.</p>
<p>Regardless, behavioral interventions</p>
<p>coupled with drug-based interventions</p>
<p>are always more effective than either one alone.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there is a decent size kit of drugs</p>
<p>that can help with bulimia.</p>
<p>I mentioned some of them before,</p>
<p>things like propriron, welbutrin,</p>
<p>some of the serotonergic drugs</p>
<p>and some of the drugs used to treat impulsivity.</p>
<p>So we have on the one hand anorexia,</p>
<p>which seems to be a disruption in habit</p>
<p>and a coupling of unhealthy habits,</p>
<p>in this case, food restriction,</p>
<p>to the reward pathway.</p>
<p>And on the flip side,</p>
<p>we have binge eating disorder and bulimia,</p>
<p>where a very unhealthy habit of gorging oneself with food,</p>
<p>sometimes followed by purging,</p>
<p>is not necessarily coupled to reward.</p>
<p>They feel terrible when they do that, right?</p>
<p>The anorexic feels great</p>
<p>about restricting their food intake.</p>
<p>They feel like they&rsquo;re winning some sort of game.</p>
<p>The circuitry is flipped somehow that way.</p>
<p>With bulimia,</p>
<p>they feel horrible about the fact that they&rsquo;re binging.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s immense shame.</p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t control themselves.</p>
<p>The reward is set up before the behavior.</p>
<p>The reward is set up in drawing them to food</p>
<p>and in making food look like something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s incredibly appetizing,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s no impulse break.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no way for them to stop that kind of behavior.</p>
<p>So really kind of troubling thing to think about.</p>
<p>On either case,</p>
<p>I think for those of us that know anorexics</p>
<p>or have observed anorexia,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so hard to see somebody starve themselves</p>
<p>to near death or to death.</p>
<p>What more could be disturbing?</p>
<p>Well, equally disturbing is somebody</p>
<p>who has an abundance of food and is gorging themselves</p>
<p>and then feels terrible about it.</p>
<p>So these are heavy topics.</p>
<p>These are topics that frankly,</p>
<p>no one really wants to talk about</p>
<p>unless they know someone who&rsquo;s suffering from them</p>
<p>or they themselves suffer from them.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;ve tried to do today</p>
<p>is try and give you a window</p>
<p>into what really underlies these things</p>
<p>that we call eating disorders.</p>
<p>I hope I&rsquo;ve done that at the level of biology,</p>
<p>neurocircuitry, mechanism, endocrinology,</p>
<p>and some of the psychology.</p>
<p>As with any episode of this podcast,</p>
<p>but especially in this month where we&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about mental health issues and mental health disorders,</p>
<p>behavioral disorders,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no way that I can exhaustively cover</p>
<p>all the different forms of treatment.</p>
<p>You have the Maudley approach.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got all these different approaches</p>
<p>to depression and to anorexia, et cetera.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;ve tried to do is give you a framework.</p>
<p>And in doing that,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve tried to give you a framework of understanding</p>
<p>that also applies to this question</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s I think equally important</p>
<p>and goes alongside the treatment of eating disorders</p>
<p>is what in the world is healthy eating?</p>
<p>What in the world is a healthy relationship to food?</p>
<p>I like to think that I have a healthy relationship to food.</p>
<p>I know the foods I like, I enjoy them.</p>
<p>There are 10 or 15 foods in particular</p>
<p>that I like very much.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve mentioned a few of them on the podcast before</p>
<p>and was sort of amused, surprised,</p>
<p>and perplexed as to why, for instance,</p>
<p>I do enjoy eating butter, not in huge amounts,</p>
<p>but I do like butter.</p>
<p>So that seemed to be pretty triggering for folks out there.</p>
<p>A small selection of people decided</p>
<p>that the ingestion of butter was a health concern.</p>
<p>Look, to me, ingesting butter in small quantities</p>
<p>is something that I&rsquo;m comfortable with</p>
<p>and my blood lipid profiles feel good.</p>
<p>They look good to me.</p>
<p>For other people, that might not be the case.</p>
<p>For some people, the idea of eating an animal-based food</p>
<p>is probably so repulsive</p>
<p>that it actually can make them feel physically sick.</p>
<p>And I think that we should be aware</p>
<p>that that kind of mental phenotype exists.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not calling it a pathology.</p>
<p>For other people like myself,</p>
<p>things like butter and meat feel healthy.</p>
<p>Now, what quantities?</p>
<p>Well, I enjoy eating very much.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not shy about this.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked about it on the podcast before.</p>
<p>I enjoy eating.</p>
<p>Some people have a very complicated relationship to food.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t think of it as nourishment.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t enjoy it socially.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a stressful thing for them</p>
<p>based on their personal history</p>
<p>or maybe just general anxiety around food.</p>
<p>And I hope that in sharing this information</p>
<p>about the fact that anytime we approach food,</p>
<p>these neurons in the arcuate area of our hypothalamus</p>
<p>actually increase our levels of anxiety.</p>
<p>This is related to that point that Dr. Halpern made,</p>
<p>which was that from an evolutionary standpoint,</p>
<p>it is advantageous to ingest as much food</p>
<p>as often as possible, as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>We now know that to not be healthy</p>
<p>in this age of abundance</p>
<p>where calories are essentially everywhere.</p>
<p>And yet a lot of people feel anxious</p>
<p>in anticipation of a meal.</p>
<p>What could be useful to them?</p>
<p>Well, whether or not they have an eating disorder or not,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very clear that developing methods to calm oneself</p>
<p>in the presence of any anxiety or fear-inducing stimulus</p>
<p>can be beneficial.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked about some of these</p>
<p>in episodes related to stress,</p>
<p>things like the physiological side,</p>
<p>two inhales through the nose and a long exhale.</p>
<p>Things like mindfulness meditation certainly can help.</p>
<p>There are data, a lot of studies out there</p>
<p>showing that meditation practice can help people</p>
<p>deal with eating-related anxiety and disorders.</p>
<p>I think as a general rule,</p>
<p>trying to avoid approaching a meal</p>
<p>or sitting down to eat in an anxious state</p>
<p>is probably a good idea, but let&rsquo;s be realistic.</p>
<p>How often can we do that?</p>
<p>I think most of us are going to have circumstances</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;re rushing around</p>
<p>trying to just eat before we head out or get to a meal,</p>
<p>and then we sit down and we find ourselves eating.</p>
<p>This is one of the first times in human evolution</p>
<p>where we mostly eat out of a desire to consume food,</p>
<p>not out of a need for food.</p>
<p>Most everybody could go a fairly long period of time</p>
<p>just ingesting water and electrolytes,</p>
<p>and not that I&rsquo;m suggesting people do that,</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s face it.</p>
<p>We largely eat nowadays because of a desire to eat,</p>
<p>not a need to eat,</p>
<p>and yet we need to eat on a fairly regular basis.</p>
<p>And so no topic is more complicated and nuanced</p>
<p>than food and nutrition,</p>
<p>and in particular as it relates to eating disorders.</p>
<p>So the major takeaways today are</p>
<p>we should all be asking the question,</p>
<p>what is healthy eating for us?</p>
<p>How do we develop a relationship to food</p>
<p>that we can enjoy food,</p>
<p>hopefully both socially and on our own,</p>
<p>but that we are not neurotic and compulsive about it?</p>
<p>For those of you that intermittent fast,</p>
<p>this also applies, right?</p>
<p>What, you know, God forbid,</p>
<p>if you eat 30 minutes before your eating window starts,</p>
<p>what does that mean?</p>
<p>If it means something catastrophic,</p>
<p>do you have an eating disorder?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, maybe you have an anxiety disorder.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s for you to explore.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t manage to eat five meals a day</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s your obsession,</p>
<p>well then, you know, the same thing applies.</p>
<p>These are questions that we can all ask ourselves.</p>
<p>Today, we focus on the extremes of food-related behaviors</p>
<p>that really qualify as genuine disorders.</p>
<p>They are in the psychiatric manuals</p>
<p>and they are diagnosable</p>
<p>and they are serious health concerns.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not just mentally troubling and concerning</p>
<p>for the people suffering from them</p>
<p>and the people around them,</p>
<p>but they are genuine health concerns.</p>
<p>Just want to reiterate that anorexia nervosa</p>
<p>is the most deadly psychiatric disorder by a huge margin.</p>
<p>And if you look statistically</p>
<p>at the number of people with eating disorders</p>
<p>and that die of eating disorders,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not far off from the number of people</p>
<p>that die from automobile accidents.</p>
<p>I know that that sounds like a ridiculous number,</p>
<p>but you can look this up.</p>
<p>This is particularly true in certain countries.</p>
<p>Why that is, we don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>But again, this is not a new phenomenon.</p>
<p>This is not just related to body image issues</p>
<p>that are created through social media and media.</p>
<p>And as a final point on that,</p>
<p>many of you are probably asking,</p>
<p>what about plastic surgery?</p>
<p>What about all the steps that people are going through,</p>
<p>excuse me, to preen themselves and change themselves?</p>
<p>Are people addicted to plastic surgery?</p>
<p>Is that a form of body dysmorphia?</p>
<p>And indeed it is.</p>
<p>And so we will do an episode on exercise related</p>
<p>and plastic surgery related body dysmorphia.</p>
<p>I think there is very little question</p>
<p>that those types of disorders are clearly related</p>
<p>to what we&rsquo;re observing in social media and in media,</p>
<p>that this shift of, for instance, action heroes,</p>
<p>if you look at action heroes in the 80s,</p>
<p>there were very few men that were very large.</p>
<p>You had your Terminator,</p>
<p>you had your Stallones and your Schwarzeneggers</p>
<p>and a few others,</p>
<p>but the men in movies tended to be, if they were muscular,</p>
<p>they were far more svelte than they are now.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s this kind of,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s literally a hypertrophy of the imagery.</p>
<p>And likewise, there&rsquo;s been hypertrophy</p>
<p>of the female body shape as it&rsquo;s portrayed in the media.</p>
<p>There are body dysmorphia that are related</p>
<p>to those types of things</p>
<p>and that relate to things like plastic surgery,</p>
<p>steroid abuse, diet drug abuse, and so on.</p>
<p>Definitely important to think about and consider</p>
<p>and definitely deserving of its own episode.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve learned a lot of neuroscience today.</p>
<p>I hope that was useful in thinking about these disorders</p>
<p>and in thinking about other aspects of feeding</p>
<p>and motivated behaviors.</p>
<p>I would love for you to take away this model</p>
<p>that was handed off to me that I think is so powerful</p>
<p>for thinking about all sorts of things,</p>
<p>not just eating, but all kinds of behaviors and perceptions</p>
<p>that you have one box for what you think,</p>
<p>one box for what you do.</p>
<p>And what is intervening between those?</p>
<p>Why is it that you can know better and not do better?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s because you also have to cope</p>
<p>with the subconscious homeostatic processes</p>
<p>and reward processes.</p>
<p>And those oftentimes can be disrupted</p>
<p>in ways that we find ourselves doing things</p>
<p>that are not good for us or not good for other people.</p>
<p>But fortunately, there is this great gift,</p>
<p>which is that knowledge of knowledge</p>
<p>can allow you to do better without question.</p>
<p>And that knowledge of knowledge,</p>
<p>allowing you to do better over time</p>
<p>leads to this incredible phenomenon called neuroplasticity,</p>
<p>which essentially is translated</p>
<p>into doing better over time, even if difficult,</p>
<p>eventually makes doing better reflexive.</p>
