<p>Jenna, welcome to the podcast. Listeners, I&rsquo;m so excited to welcome Jenna from Roses</p>
<p>for Everybody. How are you?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m good. Thank you for having me.</p>
<p>Yes. Give us quickly a brief overview of the campaign, how you got involved. Our listeners</p>
<p>might not have heard of it before. So give us a little intro.</p>
<p>Thank you. So yeah, I am one of the members of Roses for Everybody, which is a campaign</p>
<p>to, as funny as it sounds, demand that the Bachelor franchise start casting fat people</p>
<p>in their show. It&rsquo;s been on for over 20 years. And in those 20 years, they have had over</p>
<p>1,142 individuals on the show. And there&rsquo;s only been two self-identified plus size individuals</p>
<p>who went home night one without less than a minute of airtime each. That is a huge exclusion</p>
<p>and it is problematic. And we are aiming to get representation in this specific sphere</p>
<p>in order to help with just like positive media representation of fat people. It&rsquo;s still lacking</p>
<p>in pretty much all forms of media, especially reality television. And yeah, we&rsquo;re really</p>
<p>excited about it. We launched on July 11th, which was the most recent season of The Bachelorette.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re really excited to have a campaign that is bringing the conversation of body</p>
<p>diversity into an area that most people don&rsquo;t want to talk about it, but it&rsquo;s very important.</p>
<p>Yes. And I had heard you on another podcast and I loved you were talking about the language.</p>
<p>So guys, we are going to focus on that a little bit today, the language around fat, someone</p>
<p>being fat and why there is this fat phobia, the stigma and what we can do to change that.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re going to really dive into that. But first of all, I want to make sure everyone</p>
<p>listening knows this episode is also on YouTube and we would love for you to come and be part</p>
<p>of the conversation. You can comment on the YouTube video and let us know what is this</p>
<p>like in your culture, in your country? Do you have the similar, you know, fat phobia</p>
<p>or these similar stigmas behind the word fat? What do you think of when someone says, is</p>
<p>this word used in a negative way as a moral judgment, moral judgment? Yes, morale, morale.</p>
<p>Yes, exactly. So I&rsquo;m excited to dive into that with you today, especially.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think that, you know, we planned this campaign very thoughtfully. We spent four</p>
<p>months planning it. We have a graphic designer. We have people who work in media. We have</p>
<p>people who do copywriting. And one of our biggest things that we had to really work</p>
<p>on was talking about the language that we use as, as all your listeners know, like language</p>
<p>is so, so important, how we use it, what do we mean by it? And we definitely came across</p>
<p>the concept of, do we use the word fat in our campaign? Because we do know that there</p>
<p>is such a pushback to that word in our society. However, we really sat with what our beliefs</p>
<p>are and what our goals are and it&rsquo;s fat liberation. And we can&rsquo;t really fight for acceptance and</p>
<p>to end oppression regarding how people are treated, fat people without using the words</p>
<p>and without being intentional about them. And we will get into in a couple of minutes,</p>
<p>but fat is a neutral word. It should not be a moral negativity that is put upon somebody.</p>
<p>And so if you believe that, then we can use this word in a positive or neutral way. And</p>
<p>so we just want to talk about is how, how do we use that word in the United States?</p>
<p>First of all, we know this is different in every culture and every, but I do think this</p>
<p>is in some ways international. I have a feeling that our listeners will relate to this in</p>
<p>their own culture. I know what it&rsquo;s like in the United States and a few of the countries</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve visited, but let&rsquo;s talk about like, first of all, just why, why is there this</p>
<p>negative stigma? And I love that you shared why you chose to use the word fat guys. Jenna&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to share three tips of how you can get involved, how you can help eliminate that</p>
<p>stigma. And first let&rsquo;s dive into why, why should we eliminate this stigma? Why should,</p>
<p>why should we change the way we talk about and the way we think about the word fat?</p>
<p>Yeah. I mean, I think it&rsquo;s as simple as it&rsquo;s hard to undo centuries and centuries of negative</p>
<p>connotation, but it is as simple as the word fat is not a negative thing. And it used to</p>
<p>not be used that way. You know, as early as like the 14th and 17th century during like</p>
<p>the Renaissance time, fat was a positive thing. It was a sign of wealth and prosperity. We</p>
<p>were seeing art depicting women and men and fatter bodies as a good thing. And then you</p>
<p>add one of my favorite artists, very healthy, fat people, beautiful paintings.</p>
<p>Beautiful. Yeah, exactly. And then when you add in the, uh, slave trade and the way that</p>
<p>we use anti-blackness, uh, and you add in the way that we started to characterize fatness</p>
<p>as a negative thing is literally born from anti-blackness. We have a lot of resources</p>
<p>on our page about that and you can research it and do some reading on a book we recommend</p>
<p>is fearing the black body by Sabrina Stings and strings. Sorry. And yeah, so there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>long history of anti-blackness that gets correlated into the way we use the word negatively. And</p>
<p>we may be currently right now in 2022 don&rsquo;t think that is the case when we generally walk</p>
<p>around upholding fat phobic ideals and moral judgment on people who are fat, but that is</p>
<p>where it comes from. We started shifting once like the, um, the beginning of different centuries</p>
<p>where they started making food more available and stable and easy to get it, fatness became</p>
<p>like not a sign of prosperity and started to be used in a way to demoralize people.</p>
<p>And that goes from the hand in hand with racism and the slave trade. And this is so vital</p>
<p>and fascinating to consider the history, to think about how this developed over time,</p>
<p>where it came from that. Um, I think that&rsquo;s so important because that&rsquo;s going to help</p>
<p>us realize like, Oh, this, these are not traditions that we want to uphold. This is something</p>
<p>that should be changed. Yes. And people really want to rely on the concept of like health</p>
<p>regarding fat people. I mean, if you look up definitions of the like words, fat is just</p>
<p>a descriptor word, meaning something that is bigger, that is heavier. That&rsquo;s fine. But</p>
<p>then when you look up description words for obese and things like that, it&rsquo;s like you</p>
<p>start getting into these negative connotations, you know, and it&rsquo;s very sad. It&rsquo;s a overweight</p>
<p>is a way to consider normal, um, overweight that&rsquo;s considered normal or desirable. Why</p>
<p>is there a definition where in which we&rsquo;re saying desirable, you know, obese, grossly</p>
<p>fat and overweight it&rsquo;s, we get into these moral things and people bring in health because</p>
<p>they believe that health is an indicator or weight is indicator of health.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not true. It&rsquo;s improvement over and over again, that there are so many more factors</p>
<p>that go into play that the BMI is used a lot against fat people, but there&rsquo;s also history</p>
<p>with that as well. The BMI was created by thin white men and has a lot of deeper history</p>
<p>history and anti-blackness as well, as well as it&rsquo;s just junk science that was originally</p>
<p>created in a way, sorry, it was a created for other reasons, again, from those thin</p>
<p>white man, but it was quickly transformed into being used as a way to deny people health</p>
<p>insurance in its original form. And people don&rsquo;t kind of realize that as well, it&rsquo;s supposed</p>
<p>to have an indication of people who are on the extremes, extremely underweight, extremely</p>
<p>overweight, and how that does affect our health. And we&rsquo;re not saying that there aren&rsquo;t elements</p>
<p>where that does affect people&rsquo;s health, but in order to deny people medical insurance,</p>
<p>they started using it as a structure. And then that&rsquo;s where it like started. And now</p>
<p>is where it is today where people just be like, oh, well, I&rsquo;m over the B the recommended</p>
<p>BMI. What does that mean? Right. Okay. I&rsquo;m definitely going to have</p>
<p>to do a lot of research. And I think our listeners are as well, because you&rsquo;re telling me things</p>
<p>that I feel like I should know that I don&rsquo;t know a lot about, like, yeah, they don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t tell us that stuff, right. Body mass index. And I didn&rsquo;t know where that came</p>
<p>from or how long it&rsquo;s been around. So I&rsquo;m going to be doing a deep dive, everybody listening,</p>
<p>you do it as well. And let&rsquo;s dive into these three tips. Jenna give us three things that</p>
<p>our listeners and myself can do to get involved and help to be a part of the solution.</p>
<p>Yes. If you&rsquo;re really interested in trying to deconstruct the way that we use the word</p>
<p>fat and other negative terms that are like society, a lot of it just stems with working</p>
<p>on it on yourself, you know, unpacking why you think fat is a bad thing. And you might</p>
<p>not write, like, I think you&rsquo;ll find that you don&rsquo;t really think that, but there are</p>
<p>so many inputs coming at us throughout society that uphold that. So one of the best ways</p>
<p>to do that is to start getting different inputs in your system and in your life.</p>
<p>So we recommend following fat creators, um, and writers and journalists and people who</p>
<p>are doing this conversation liberationists. Um, I know for myself about five years ago,</p>
<p>when I actively decided to start unfollowing people that upheld diet culture and people</p>
<p>who were instead following people who were just existing and having a great time living</p>
<p>their lives, it did wonders for my personal journey of how I accept my body and love myself.</p>
<p>Okay. I love this. Can you give us some recommendations, a couple of fat creators that you would recommend</p>
<p>who have this positive outlook?</p>
<p>Yes. One of my favorite ones right now is, um, why is it not showing? Of course, you</p>
<p>know how people&rsquo;s Instagrams are always, um, yeah, I&rsquo;m so embarrassed y&rsquo;all. Sorry. We</p>
<p>have fierce fat femme. Okay. Beautiful one. Please follow him. Um, and then we have fat</p>
<p>fab feminist. So, so you can get the idea of what these, uh, creators are doing, but</p>
<p>I definitely recommend just, um, start following a couple of plus size, uh, content creators.</p>
<p>And then you can easily a little skip a little like arrow and it&rsquo;ll show you more creators</p>
<p>of the similar style. And you can just start doing that and diversifying your, your feed.</p>
<p>Awesome. I love that idea. I am going to take notes and them and I want my daughters to</p>
<p>follow them because this is so important to me that my daughters help be part of the solution</p>
<p>as well and have a positive mindset about them and their bodies. Okay. So give us their</p>
<p>second tip.</p>
<p>Um, and this one is more of also a thing you can be doing in your interpersonal life. When</p>
<p>you hear people using the word fat in a negative way, call them out, call them in gently. Why</p>
<p>are you speaking that way? Why are you putting a moral judgment on food? Um, the way your</p>
<p>body looks, the way somebody else&rsquo;s body looks, uh, is a way that we do a lot of unpacking</p>
<p>of our, uh, systematic, you know, oppression in our world, racism, homophobia, transphobia.</p>
<p>So if you are already on a journey where you&rsquo;re doing a lot of that work and calling out people</p>
<p>when you hear, um, somebody be transphobic, think of fat phobia as the same thing, you</p>
<p>know, Oh my God, I&rsquo;m just so, I can&rsquo;t believe I, I looked so fat in that photo and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>saying in a negative way, stop them. Why are we saying this in a negative term? That is</p>
<p>not a bad thing.</p>
<p>I love that. I love that tip so much. And I love to think about, you know, the efforts</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re making in other areas too, to remove any kind of phobia or racism and apply it</p>
<p>here as well. Recognize that this is also a place that either to yourself, if you find</p>
<p>yourself making a statement or to someone else to also call them out and help us all</p>
<p>be more aware of the way we&rsquo;re talking about this. Yeah. I love that.</p>
<p>It is a pretty wildly, widely accepted form of like bullying. Yes. We, we really don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>call that out as much, you know? Um, and that&rsquo;s, I&rsquo;m not trying to make any judgment as far</p>
<p>as like what is more important in our society to be unpacking by any means. Um, however,</p>
<p>like I mentioned, a lot of it&rsquo;s all coincided, you know, anti blackness is hand in hand with</p>
<p>anti fatness. So we can&rsquo;t work on one without working on many other ones. And so, yeah,</p>
<p>just try to welcome that into your work as well.</p>
<p>Definitely. Okay. Give us your third tip. I&rsquo;m excited about this one. I got a little</p>
<p>sneak peek earlier and I&rsquo;m very much on board. This one might be hard for people, but listen</p>
<p>to Lizzo. I love Lizzo. Yes. Yes. Uh, yeah. Listen, listen and hear what she is saying.</p>
<p>You know, I remember people were so mad at her for playing that flute that was owned</p>
<p>by a white person. Yeah. All that stuff. But it&rsquo;s like, well, she&rsquo;s on stage dancing, singing</p>
<p>and playing a flute. She&rsquo;s an athlete. Yes. Right. He&rsquo;s an athlete. And I know many people</p>
<p>of many different sizes who could not do what she does. And there is no, and so we just</p>
<p>see how listen to Lizzo take in her gospel so much. I tried to karaoke a song that was</p>
<p>Doja Cat, but it was rapping. And I could not do like two lines. I was like regasping</p>
<p>for breath. It is. So there&rsquo;s so much athleticism to be able to rap and sing and dance on a</p>
<p>stage when there are nerves involved too. It&rsquo;s true. And her message is so positive</p>
<p>and uplifting and body positive. I agree very much. I, I, I suggest everyone take this third</p>
<p>tip as well. Go listen to some Lizzo. I love it. And just have fun and dance. It&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>to be great. Thank you so much for joining us, Jenna, and for sharing these amazing three</p>
<p>tips and some details about this campaign. Can you let our listeners know where can they</p>
