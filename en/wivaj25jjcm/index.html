<p>questions so let&rsquo;s see if we can get as</p>
<p>many answers we possibly can all right</p>
<p>well I think that&rsquo;s fair we have a very</p>
<p>interesting Green Room first of all the</p>
<p>first participant I&rsquo;m gonna bring you up</p>
<p>in a minute here Angelo is from Sydney</p>
<p>Australia and he&rsquo;s got toothpicks</p>
<p>propping his eyelids up because it&rsquo;s one</p>
<p>o&rsquo;clock in the morning there but he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>still got a great disposition and</p>
<p>secondly we have a nice lady Suzanne</p>
<p>from East Texas who had no idea she was</p>
<p>going to be in the show she&rsquo;s sort of</p>
<p>unwittingly got some link clicked on it</p>
<p>and discovered that she is going to be</p>
<p>so she&rsquo;s got a question about vitamin D</p>
<p>that a friend of hers asked and it&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>interesting question so we did not eject</p>
<p>her from the Green Room she&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>be a star just like everybody else so</p>
<p>thank you folks an interesting group</p>
<p>there in the green room and let&rsquo;s do</p>
<p>start in deference to Angelo who</p>
<p>is being very courageous and staying</p>
<p>awake to come on board an angel unmute</p>
<p>yourself and you&rsquo;re on with Dr bird</p>
<p>hey doctor how are you hi great thanks</p>
<p>uh Dr eight months ago I started</p>
<p>intermittent fasting I lost 40 kilos and</p>
<p>then I was diagnosed with gallstones and</p>
<p>I started having severe attacks</p>
<p>um I watched YouTube videos I started</p>
<p>taking biosols tatka and cod liver oil</p>
<p>the attack stopped but my doctor said</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re never ever doing intermittent</p>
<p>fasting again</p>
<p>and I find intermittent fasting very</p>
<p>beneficial for me it&rsquo;s helped me on a</p>
<p>very different levels and I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>willing to give it up just like that</p>
<p>um I need your advice on how to take</p>
<p>advisors and tatka exactly when I do</p>
<p>intermittent fasting</p>
<p>and if I can eat small amounts of fatty</p>
<p>foods because also I was banned from</p>
<p>eating fatty foods</p>
<p>so did they do an ultrasound to look at</p>
<p>your gallbladder to see gallstones</p>
<p>yes</p>
<p>they found bio sludge and multiple small</p>
<p>gallstones he said they found what</p>
<p>songs</p>
<p>okay and so um did you ask them um</p>
<p>why do they think intermittent fasting</p>
<p>would make the stones worse</p>
<p>uh they said because when I don&rsquo;t eat</p>
<p>much the gallbladder doesn&rsquo;t contract</p>
<p>and the bar starts concentrating uh in</p>
<p>the global forming cholesterol</p>
<p>cholesterol</p>
<p>and did they tell you</p>
<p>um why you should cut down your fat did</p>
<p>they tell you did they say that that fat</p>
<p>causes gallstones yeah because fat</p>
<p>um increase the contraction of the</p>
<p>gallbladder and it will make it hard for</p>
<p>me to</p>
<p>to pass the while and to digestify the</p>
<p>fancy food</p>
<p>yeah I&rsquo;m just going to give you my two</p>
<p>cents my opinion on this because</p>
<p>um there&rsquo;s a lot of people who do</p>
<p>intermittent fasting that have wonderful</p>
<p>gallbladders and it doesn&rsquo;t have a</p>
<p>problem and so what what really caused</p>
<p>the gallstone</p>
<p>um is a super concentrated amount of</p>
<p>cholesterol</p>
<p>but it actually comes because also you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have enough Buy on the first place</p>
<p>so um when you don&rsquo;t have the bile then</p>
<p>things kind of get concentrated</p>
<p>um but the gallbladder and the bile</p>
<p>ducts are the prime one of the primary</p>
<p>routes of getting rid of excess</p>
<p>cholesterol that&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s purpose right so</p>
<p>um this is why even when I recommend</p>
<p>keto we always want to do it healthily</p>
<p>and do it with a lot of vegetables</p>
<p>because that tends to also help help the</p>
<p>situation helps to kind of flush out</p>
<p>some of the extra cholesterol as well</p>
<p>but here&rsquo;s here&rsquo;s the thing</p>
<p>um that I want to mention</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>what really is behind a deficiency in</p>
<p>bile assaults is usually one big cause</p>
<p>is either cortisol or high insulin and</p>
<p>insulin resistance so in reality when</p>
<p>people</p>
<p>um start to eat more carbs okay or eat</p>
<p>more frequently they can actually worsen</p>
<p>the insulin resistance and create more</p>
<p>of a problem</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>so when you donate you get to allow the</p>
<p>whole digestive system to flush things</p>
<p>out and it is true that you get more of</p>
<p>a concentrated amount of bile but you</p>
<p>also get concentrated bile salts</p>
<p>the other thing is with the</p>
<p>when you cut back on your fat if you</p>
<p>take a look at even people that go like</p>
<p>no fat</p>
<p>they have a higher inch rates of getting</p>
<p>gallstones because</p>
<p>um they don&rsquo;t allow the gallbladder to</p>
<p>to work that well and so you kind of</p>
<p>turn that whole mechanism off so you</p>
<p>know I think it&rsquo;s just it&rsquo;s kind of like</p>
<p>the standard</p>
<p>reply of and I would bring up these</p>
<p>points I just have and this is the whole</p>
<p>point is to give people other pieces of</p>
<p>the puzzle that they might not get in</p>
<p>traditional health care and there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>lot of data I have on the cell even like</p>
<p>the remedy of adding just adding</p>
<p>two things one is the tuck cut on an</p>
<p>empty stomach I would take two in the</p>
<p>morning an empty stomach and then two in</p>
<p>the afternoon and then I would take also</p>
<p>probably two or three with a meal not</p>
<p>Tucka but the regular bile salts that</p>
<p>would be a protocol that I would</p>
<p>recommend and then what you can do is</p>
<p>you can always just reevaluate get</p>
<p>another ultrasound to see if those</p>
<p>stones are shrinking and getting smaller</p>
<p>and disappearing and even the sludge</p>
<p>that kind of plugs up the bile ducts to</p>
<p>see if that actually is</p>
<p>gonna go down too and then you really</p>
<p>know if it&rsquo;s working and the other thing</p>
<p>is that um</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll know too by just by feeling</p>
<p>that that fullness underneath the right</p>
<p>rib cage and if there&rsquo;s less of that and</p>
<p>better digestion if your stools</p>
<p>um maybe are no longer floating that</p>
<p>means that you&rsquo;re getting better</p>
<p>digestion so</p>
<p>you know I just um I wanted just to give</p>
<p>you another viewpoint on that and see if</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t help you</p>
<p>thank you so I take two tatka on empty</p>
<p>stomach twice a day and then after each</p>
<p>meal I have to take two bile salts yes</p>
<p>after I finish straight away yes yeah</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>yeah thank you very much and then</p>
<p>recheck it and see if uh see if it gets</p>
<p>better over time uh obviously and I</p>
<p>continue with intermittent fasting 16 by</p>
<p>8 and that will work</p>
<p>well you know you should try it and see</p>
<p>if you feel better because I know the</p>
<p>benefits of fasting are huge and so</p>
<p>um you want to look at the whole picture</p>
<p>what it&rsquo;s doing to you you probably lost</p>
<p>a lot of weight you probably also when</p>
<p>you lost fat</p>
<p>a lot of that fat cell guess what has</p>
<p>cholesterol that has to come out</p>
<p>so if you don&rsquo;t do intermittent fasting</p>
<p>then what&rsquo;s going to happen is how are</p>
<p>you going to lose weight how are you</p>
<p>going to have the benefits that fasting</p>
<p>gives you it&rsquo;s real difficult to have</p>
<p>autophagy and all these wonderful</p>
<p>benefits by eating frequently it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>uh it&rsquo;s really hard so</p>
<p>um I don&rsquo;t know from my viewpoint is</p>
<p>that if that&rsquo;s the best Viewpoint in the</p>
<p>world so again I&rsquo;m just giving my</p>
<p>opinion do what you want but um yeah I</p>
<p>just wanted intermittent fasting has</p>
<p>helped me is it&rsquo;s helped my depression</p>
<p>my anxiety my weight loss it changed my</p>
<p>life yeah that&rsquo;s so great</p>
<p>yeah you ultimately are in charge of</p>
<p>your body uh and so you just need to</p>
<p>you know be your own Counsel on that and</p>
<p>uh</p>
<p>um I think that&rsquo;s important to</p>
<p>have your own choice over your own</p>
<p>health to be able to do what you want</p>
<p>and uh</p>
<p>unfortunately that&rsquo;s not how things are</p>
<p>going nowadays it&rsquo;s kind of like they a</p>
<p>lot of people want to be dependent on</p>
<p>the doctor and uh also dependent on</p>
<p>certain things for health information</p>
<p>but ultimately I think you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re in</p>
<p>charge of your body</p>
<p>absolutely hey Angela thanks for hanging</p>
<p>in there with us really appreciate it</p>
<p>and get back with us and let us know how</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing in the future uh let&rsquo;s see</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve got a some more things to do first</p>
<p>of all we&rsquo;re going to ask Dr Berg to</p>
<p>raise his volume a little bit normally</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>um we don&rsquo;t ask these things but you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>testing and everyone says you&rsquo;re alone</p>
<p>so if you can okay so what I&rsquo;ll do is</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to talk closer into the mic</p>
<p>how about that now that&rsquo;s better</p>
<p>okay good okay so now everyone&rsquo;s had</p>
<p>their smiles across the world as your</p>
<p>volume went up a little bit next off</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to start with a question uh</p>
<p>for the audience and then I&rsquo;m going to</p>
<p>give a question to Dr Berg and here&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the first question for today</p>
<p>okay what is the most anti-inflammatory</p>
<p>food on the planet</p>
<p>foreign</p>
<p>I think this might surprise everyone but</p>
<p>uh I want to see what you guys think</p>
<p>about that all right sounds great and</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s what a lot of people are thinking</p>
<p>about uh most of you out there in video</p>
<p>land have seen Dr Berg&rsquo;s videos talking</p>
<p>about the continued suppression of</p>
<p>information around the world and in this</p>
<p>case particularly in medical advice or</p>
<p>health advice Etc Dr Berg would you like</p>
<p>to maybe give us a little briefing and</p>
<p>exactly what&rsquo;s going on</p>
<p>so I recently posted a video a couple</p>
<p>days ago</p>
<p>might have been yesterday nose</p>
<p>yeah it was yesterday I think yesterday</p>
<p>morning was it</p>
<p>um anyway</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>YouTube has recently put out a</p>
<p>policy a guideline that they partner up</p>
<p>with certain medical groups that and</p>
<p>also enforcing the</p>
<p>the Viewpoint of</p>
<p>consensus medical consensus so anything</p>
<p>that now conflicts with like the World</p>
<p>Health Organization is going to be um</p>
<p>filtered and censored so it&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>be it&rsquo;s becoming harder and harder</p>
<p>to get alternative viewpoints on health</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s becoming harder to even being able</p>
<p>to find information on the ketogenic</p>
<p>diet because now when you type the keto</p>
<p>diet which by the way I have 985 videos</p>
<p>roughly</p>
<p>um you can&rsquo;t find them unless you type</p>
<p>Dr Berg slash topic so um you know</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re taking away people&rsquo;s ability to</p>
<p>View and have access to other viewpoints</p>
<p>diversity of viewpoints I think it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>good so I did a survey and I was shocked</p>
<p>to find out I have over I think 30 we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>at 36</p>
<p>000 uh surveyed surveys 36 000 people so</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going through them</p>
<p>tabulating them and I think I&rsquo;m a number</p>
<p>200 right now and the message is very</p>
<p>clear people don&rsquo;t like this they want</p>
<p>to have a free choice of what they want</p>
<p>to see they want they went to YouTube to</p>
<p>find alternative viewpoints because</p>
<p>medicine was not working for them and</p>
<p>the people and men and also a lot of</p>
<p>people also want both they want medicine</p>
<p>and they want alternative so and very</p>
<p>unfortunately it&rsquo;s becoming restrictive</p>
<p>and so it&rsquo;s really hard to find</p>
<p>information so yes we we&rsquo;re going in</p>
<p>other places as well we&rsquo;re going to be</p>
<p>on X we&rsquo;re on X right now Rumble other</p>
<p>places so you can find information but</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s I saw the writing on the</p>
<p>wall and uh I knew it was coming and I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>sure</p>
<p>you know that video might they might</p>
<p>return they&rsquo;re probably gonna I predict</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna retaliate and do a smear</p>
<p>campaign but oh well you know that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>inevitable but the point is that</p>
<p>you know people need to get alternative</p>
<p>use on health and uh I have a lot of</p>
<p>them and I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;re crazy and</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;re dangerous and I</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s very very it makes sense</p>
<p>especially in the area of diet and food</p>
<p>uh so that&rsquo;s the latest Steve well I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>the great benefactor of it I&rsquo;m 45 pounds</p>
<p>down my depression has Angelo pointed</p>
<p>out one of the biggest factors is gone</p>
<p>from not stuffing down sugar all day and</p>
<p>I think one of the the highlights of</p>
<p>this is Dr Berg is not running around</p>
<p>with the emphasis on telling you how to</p>
<p>cure things he&rsquo;s telling you how not to</p>
<p>end up in the hospital with them in the</p>
<p>first place how to be healthier and I</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t imagine and the remedy is talked</p>
<p>about less sugar this that and the other</p>
<p>are all very obvious and and those are</p>
<p>somehow uh you know looked a scance at</p>
<p>and it just doesn&rsquo;t make any sense at</p>
<p>all so and I might also point out that</p>
<p>the medical system itself the the ones</p>
<p>that the who listened to one day Salt&rsquo;s</p>
<p>good the next day it&rsquo;s bad one day this</p>
<p>is good one so there&rsquo;s no consistency in</p>
<p>that and there shouldn&rsquo;t be because any</p>
<p>good medical science including the</p>
<p>research that Dr Berg does should end up</p>
<p>on looking for new answers and looking</p>
<p>for problems and they crop up all the</p>
<p>time in the medical industry as well so</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s true today and you must listen to</p>
<p>them they themselves will say is not</p>
<p>true tomorrow so that&rsquo;s a very dangerous</p>
<p>Dynamic to suggest that the entire world</p>
<p>must you know feed off of that</p>
<p>information without any scrutiny without</p>
<p>any alternative views that&rsquo;s crippling I</p>
<p>think that you&rsquo;re just trying to solve a</p>
<p>problem they&rsquo;re trying to put high</p>
<p>quality unbiased</p>
<p>high quality health information out</p>
<p>there Steve that is</p>
<p>um you know objective that&rsquo;s not tied</p>
<p>with any vested interest and that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re trying to do so yeah absolutely</p>
<p>you must be right</p>
<p>all right anyway so let&rsquo;s move and let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>see if we got answers which we did to</p>
<p>our Lightning Fast audience okay first</p>
<p>question of the day asked what is the</p>
<p>most anti-inflammatory food on the</p>
<p>planet Dr Berg promised a surprise here</p>
<p>65 say it&rsquo;s turmeric 20 say it&rsquo;s garlic</p>
<p>five percent say it&rsquo;s cruciferous</p>
<p>veggies like cabbage and so on</p>
<p>um and then five percent say blueberries</p>
<p>and another the final five percent say</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s cod liver or cod liver oil</p>
<p>very good answers</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>and this is probably going to surprise</p>
<p>everyone</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>if you take a look at any condition I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>talking about</p>
<p>autoimmune conditions which are always</p>
<p>an anti-inflammatory irritable bowel</p>
<p>conditions</p>
<p>arthritis rheumatoid Osteo there&rsquo;s a lot</p>
<p>of things you can take to help reduce</p>
<p>inflammation but</p>
<p>most inflammatory conditions start in</p>
<p>the gut</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>glued glutamine is an amino acid</p>
<p>that um</p>
<p>is one of the best Healers</p>
<p>Steve am I getting a rebirth</p>
<p>some little strange noise let me look</p>
<p>and see if I can figure that out just a</p>
<p>tiny bit but I wouldn&rsquo;t adjust your mic</p>
<p>some other anomaly</p>
<p>Okay so</p>
<p>the question is what food has the most</p>
<p>glutamine</p>
<p>and the answer is</p>
<p>meat beef specifically so I know and uh</p>
<p>now if you don&rsquo;t consume meat or beef</p>
<p>um you can still get it from other</p>
<p>sources</p>
<p>um one of the best</p>
<p>hands down best vegetables that you can</p>
<p>get it from is cabbage</p>
<p>cabbage is loaded with glutamine too but</p>
<p>beef is at the top of the list now this</p>
<p>explains why a lot of people with</p>
<p>autoimmune conditions and a lot of</p>
<p>people with especially inflammatory gut</p>
<p>issues that&rsquo;s the big one irritable</p>
<p>bowel syndrome when they go on</p>
<p>carnivore and they do more beef they</p>
<p>feel better it&rsquo;s all that glutamine that</p>
<p>is feeding</p>
<p>the this single layer cell</p>
<p>um in your colon that um</p>
<p>gets 30 of its energy from glutamine</p>
<p>and so it&rsquo;s you&rsquo;re feeding it you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>giving it energy you&rsquo;re supporting it</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re also tightening up those</p>
<p>little Junctions that are part of the</p>
<p>leaky gut situation now</p>
<p>some people are not going to believe me</p>
<p>but um you should just try it because I</p>
<p>remember even when I started Keto the</p>
<p>first thing I made a change with is I</p>
<p>started eating like a buffalo burger I</p>
<p>ate 30 and man did I feel good with my</p>
<p>inflammation I had arthritis all the way</p>
<p>up and down my spine and my fingers and</p>
<p>and that all went away so it&rsquo;s it might</p>
<p>this might be new information but I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>just throwing this out there you should</p>
<p>try it and see what happens and if you</p>
<p>have any problem digesting meat just</p>
<p>start taking something like betaine</p>
<p>hydrochloride which is an acidifier to</p>
<p>help you really break down it but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the grains primarily that really</p>
<p>stir up the inflammation and the sugars</p>
<p>and refined Foods in the junk foods</p>
<p>which is basically makes up 83 percent</p>
<p>of all the calories in the grocery store</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>very interesting now of course fish has</p>
<p>glutamine too and so do those other</p>
<p>foods but primarily it&rsquo;s the the one</p>
<p>that has the most is the is the red meat</p>
<p>um the exact food that people are trying</p>
<p>to tell people not to eat is a great</p>
<p>healing food by the way so anyway this</p>
<p>might be new information and uh test it</p>
<p>out to see if it&rsquo;s true for you</p>
<p>wonderful that&rsquo;s terrific so once again</p>
<p>um let&rsquo;s talk about who is watching us</p>
<p>all over the world and who will continue</p>
<p>to be able to watch us we promise you</p>
<p>all there&rsquo;s a lot of nice stations like</p>

<p>we&rsquo;ve got some Canadians in there so</p>
<p>thanks everybody for watching so much</p>
<p>your course are the show and make the</p>
<p>show speaking of which we&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>throw out one more question and go to</p>
<p>social media and start to saturate the</p>
<p>show with that next question up is a</p>
<p>true falser</p>
<p>all right true or false allergies start</p>
<p>in the gut</p>
<p>huh</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna find out Cindy from Facebook</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the best anti-can cancer protocol</p>
<p>in your opinion not cure but</p>
<p>well you better you better find my</p>
<p>videos really quick because they</p>
<p>probably are going to disappear on</p>
<p>cancer and I that one some of the recent</p>
<p>ones</p>
<p>um will have the protocol and again this</p>
<p>is</p>
<p>not I&rsquo;m not claiming anything about it</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a interesting protocol based</p>
<p>on Research</p>
<p>that I participated in I</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>bunded half of the research in Europe</p>
<p>and it was incredible published study</p>
<p>that you can I watch on my video and uh</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a natural protocol that you can</p>
<p>apply that uh</p>
<p>seems to give a lot of great positive</p>
<p>benefits but again no claims just take</p>
<p>the information and and use it how you</p>
<p>would want to okay Dr Berg slash topics</p>
<p>is that correct</p>
<p>yeah just type Dr Berg and then any</p>
<p>topic with health and then it will show</p>
<p>up I see</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>okay very good let&rsquo;s see a cat from</p>
<p>Facebook why do I get heart palpitations</p>
<p>when I fast</p>
<p>well here&rsquo;s the thing</p>
<p>um a lot of these</p>
<p>water-soluble nutrients okay</p>
<p>um don&rsquo;t get stored in the body very</p>
<p>long</p>
<p>so when you fast you&rsquo;re not eating and</p>
<p>you might be already deficient like a</p>
<p>lot of people are</p>
<p>and all of a sudden you become very</p>
<p>deficient especially</p>
<p>um with potassium</p>
<p>and even the water-soluble vitamin B1</p>
<p>both of those if they&rsquo;re deficient will</p>
<p>cause an elevation in the pulse rate</p>
<p>so what you want to do is take</p>
<p>especially when fasting I always</p>
<p>recommend take um electrolytes with</p>
<p>potassium and then the B vitamins and</p>
<p>that should solve that problem pretty</p>
<p>nicely</p>
<p>wonderful okay let&rsquo;s see uh David from</p>
<p>Facebook what does it mean when you have</p>
<p>elevated glucose levels when fasting but</p>
<p>normal we&rsquo;re not fasting that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>interesting</p>
<p>chances are you have what&rsquo;s so called</p>
<p>the dawn phenomena which is uh your</p>
<p>liver</p>
<p>is making sugar even though you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>eating sugar and it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s a bit of a</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a little bit more technical to that</p>
<p>and you can watch my video on it but the</p>
<p>point is that if you have either</p>
<p>diabetes pre-diabetes or insulin</p>
<p>resistance your liver is going to be</p>
<p>making</p>
<p>more sugar than you should</p>
<p>have and so it&rsquo;s not coming from the</p>
<p>diet so what you want to do</p>
<p>you want to do things to improve insulin</p>
<p>resistance</p>
<p>one</p>
<p>apple cider vinegar in your water</p>
<p>through the day</p>
<p>um sip it with a straw dilute it with</p>
<p>water</p>
<p>um berberang is a good one cinnamon is</p>
<p>good and then get on keto and</p>
<p>intermittent fasting and do that for</p>
<p>um some period of months and what should</p>
<p>happen is the blood sugars will come</p>
<p>down if you&rsquo;re concerned with it you can</p>
<p>always go for a long walk and burn off</p>
<p>those sugars but it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s because the</p>
<p>liver is making</p>
<p>um a little too much glucose because of</p>
<p>the resistance with the insulin that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on and it&rsquo;s trying to compensate</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s as far as I&rsquo;m going to go on</p>
<p>this video um this presentation because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s a lot more to it but I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t want to you know spend too much</p>
<p>time on that all right well let&rsquo;s move</p>
<p>along with the answers for quiz question</p>
<p>number two which was a true falser and</p>
<p>it asked allergies start in the gut and</p>
<p>99 of our respondents say it&rsquo;s true and</p>
<p>one percent I imagine some guy up in a</p>
<p>cabin up in the hills eating muskrat one</p>
<p>person says no he&rsquo;s the outlier so is he</p>
<p>right or are the 99 right to say it is</p>
<p>true</p>
<p>mostly it&rsquo;s true okay it&rsquo;s uh there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>always an exception to the rule</p>
<p>um but mostly it&rsquo;s true a lot of</p>
<p>allergies start in the gut</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>you know because what anything let me</p>
<p>just put it this way anything that</p>
<p>bypasses mother nature anything that</p>
<p>bypasses the um the barriers of</p>
<p>immigration</p>
<p>that wall in your gut can then</p>
<p>bypass the normal immunity that happens</p>
<p>the stamp of approval so you that way</p>
<p>you the food that you eat</p>
<p>um goes to a normal process it doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>like go through a leaky hole then also</p>
<p>in your immune system incorrectly tags</p>
<p>it</p>
<p>uh I will say</p>
<p>that one percent</p>
<p>could also be right too because there is</p>
<p>another cause of analogy if someone has</p>
<p>a vaccination and there happens to be</p>
<p>peanut oil in there or some type of</p>
<p>protein</p>
<p>as an extra little additive</p>
<p>that can also be a creation of an</p>
<p>allergy because of the um</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re bypassing the normal immigration</p>
<p>process again and your immune system is</p>
<p>going to look at it like a foreign</p>
<p>Invader and</p>
<p>boom tag it as an antibi um analogy and</p>
<p>so now you could have antibodies against</p>
<p>it so</p>
<p>that could be another reason</p>
<p>all right that&rsquo;s uh that is terrific</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s see we&rsquo;ve got a nice person uh let</p>
<p>me see if I can find his name Isaac</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s been trying to get it on the show</p>
<p>and he had technical difficulties and we</p>
<p>do hear from people that are lined up</p>
<p>they got the message they want to come</p>
<p>on and then for some reason you know</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t make it in this case Isaac</p>
<p>had some technical difficulties couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>see his camera couldn&rsquo;t see his um</p>
<p>uh who couldn&rsquo;t hear his voice and for</p>
<p>the rest of you that might be suffering</p>
<p>some frustration we take it very</p>
<p>seriously and we&rsquo;re coming up with</p>
<p>remedies to have you come on next week</p>
<p>like Isaac&rsquo;s going to try to get his</p>
<p>camera together also if you come into</p>
<p>the show after we begin it&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>really difficult to kind of arrange you</p>
<p>and and brief you while we&rsquo;re right in</p>
<p>the midst of the show so try to come in</p>
<p>you know an hour before Showtime</p>
<p>wherever you are in the world and we&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>do our very best to make sure that</p>
<p>everyone is taking their time out to</p>
<p>fill out the application as it&rsquo;s called</p>
<p>Etc gets an opportunity if you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>make it that week we&rsquo;re going to try to</p>
<p>roll you into the next show as we will</p>
<p>Isaac so now here&rsquo;s the antithesis of</p>
<p>that so Suzanne from East Texas didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know she was going didn&rsquo;t apply to go on</p>
<p>a show but she got some link and</p>
<p>suddenly she popped up on her screen she</p>
<p>goes hi who are you but we convinced her</p>
<p>to stay and unmute yourself Suzanne</p>
<p>because she&rsquo;s got an interesting</p>
<p>question from a friend about vitamin D</p>
<p>so Suzanne you&rsquo;re unwittingly on the air</p>
<p>with the world go ahead with your</p>
<p>question please</p>
<p>hi Dr bergay following you so it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>like you came out of the blue I got a</p>
<p>email from your people and I clicked on</p>
<p>the link and the only reason why I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>halfway presentables because I just had</p>
<p>a like a continuing education class that</p>
<p>I was taking this morning so anyway I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>actually going to change up the question</p>
<p>because I told my husband what was going</p>
<p>on and I said do you have a question for</p>
<p>Dr Berg and he said yes I do</p>
<p>um I don&rsquo;t know that he&rsquo;s camera ready</p>
<p>though so I&rsquo;m gonna read the question</p>
<p>that he texted me and he said I have</p>
<p>experienced hair loss when taking</p>
<p>creatine I have heard fenugreek can</p>
<p>offset the extra DHT produced by taking</p>
<p>creatine can you speak to this at all</p>
<p>well here&rsquo;s the thing you&rsquo;re um</p>
<p>we there&rsquo;s several mechanisms here and</p>
<p>there could be several reasons why</p>
<p>um there&rsquo;s her loss in the first place</p>
<p>and that like I mean if I had time to</p>
<p>get a history that&rsquo;d be good but I will</p>
<p>say um</p>
<p>protein we&rsquo;re dealing with protein and</p>
<p>um in order to make a protein grow you</p>
<p>also need</p>
<p>co-factors or coenzymes like minerals or</p>
<p>trace minerals like zinc and copper and</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>selenium especially those are the three</p>
<p>that are really important to allow</p>
<p>certain proteins to be activated</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>and then the other thing is you</p>
<p>mentioned the DHT which is really has to</p>
<p>do with a very powerful form of</p>
<p>testosterone and um and you said he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>taking something to kind of curb that</p>
<p>right he&rsquo;s right here okay</p>
<p>fenugreek is a good one yeah fenugreek</p>
<p>is a good one and um so</p>
<p>if that is the problem if you have if</p>
<p>the problem</p>
<p>of your loss of hairs has to do with the</p>
<p>your the follicles the root follicles</p>
<p>are being burnt out because of this</p>
<p>powerful</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>testosterone then fenugreek should</p>
<p>should produce results but</p>
<p>on some people it&rsquo;s not the case so I</p>
<p>would I would try it</p>
<p>um for maybe a month and if you have no</p>
<p>results then chances are it&rsquo;s probably</p>
<p>something else causing it</p>
<p>um and a couple things that I always</p>
<p>recommend for hair is um the trace</p>
<p>minerals and then more B vitamins very</p>
<p>very important</p>
<p>um and then of course I&rsquo;m assuming</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re on keto because that can also</p>
<p>that insulin resistance could be a</p>
<p>problem too</p>
<p>um so those are the things that I would</p>
<p>look at it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s usually not a deficiency in dietary</p>
<p>protein but it&rsquo;s more of a deficiency</p>
<p>either the trace minerals or this very</p>
<p>powerful form of testosterone</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s also a couple other ones that</p>
<p>work a little bit better</p>
<p>uh stinging nettle root so Palmetto is a</p>
<p>good one but fenugret is also effective</p>
<p>as well but I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s as</p>
<p>powerful as something like a stinging</p>
<p>nettle root okay do you have any</p>
<p>suggestion on doses</p>
<p>no I don&rsquo;t you&rsquo;re gonna have to</p>
<p>experiment with that and just um try it</p>
<p>out okay thank you so much you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>welcome that&rsquo;s great well thank you what</p>
<p>a what a charm it was to have you and</p>
<p>your husband on uh just sort of</p>
<p>serendipity and again other people are</p>
<p>clawing to get onto the show and Suzanne</p>
<p>just sort of lounges in has a seat and</p>
<p>here she is the star of the show so that</p>
<p>was really fun all right let&rsquo;s go back</p>
<p>to</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>uh questions here&rsquo;s the third question</p>
<p>for the day doc</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>which nutrient will produce the fastest</p>
<p>relief for</p>
<p>nervous tension and irritability</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know Steve if if you&rsquo;ve ever</p>
<p>felt irritated or you had nervous</p>
<p>tension</p>
<p>what would be the nutrient that could</p>
<p>quickly solve that problem</p>
<p>not that everyone&rsquo;s anyone is watching</p>
<p>is irritated right now</p>
<p>um if you want my opinion I know it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>I think B1 B12 I mean did I let the cat</p>
<p>out of the bag who knows I&rsquo;m not an</p>
<p>expert but you asked me and I told you I</p>
<p>think there&rsquo;s a v a B vitamin somewhere</p>
<p>in there that&rsquo;s going to make me feel</p>
<p>better I think I&rsquo;ve already taken them</p>
<p>and Dr Berg is again I&rsquo;ve mentioned he</p>
<p>is the same off camera he doesn&rsquo;t start</p>
<p>throwing papers around and kicking trash</p>
<p>cans as soon as we go off the air he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just as relaxing mellow as you see him</p>
<p>now so I think he&rsquo;s holding out there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>some secret formula probably in all his</p>
<p>videos but maybe one day he&rsquo;ll give us</p>
<p>the whole list and we can be as relaxed</p>
<p>as he is okay back to social media uh</p>
<p>Audrey from Facebook what&rsquo;s the best way</p>
<p>to treat uh</p>
<p>oh gosh I shouldn&rsquo;t have done this pilo</p>
<p>piranis infection causing kidney</p>
<p>inflammation I&rsquo;m sorry he even</p>
<p>fanatically did it pilo</p>
<p>fry knitus pilot frighteness does that</p>
<p>ring a bell I</p>
<p>Steve didn&rsquo;t we have this talk before</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t pronounce the disease I know I</p>
<p>get so excited all the diseases but um</p>
<p>I get so here&rsquo;s what I need to do and</p>
<p>this is going to change audience so now</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to read the four lines of the</p>
<p>question before I blurt it out because I</p>
<p>saw Audrey and I thought oh I know how</p>
<p>to say Audrey and I read on and then ran</p>
<p>into this uh in credit uh yeah what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the pilo free what&rsquo;s the fastest way to</p>
<p>get here something like this statical</p>
<p>Kinesis that&rsquo;s really what people want</p>
<p>to know right that&rsquo;s right all right</p>
<p>well listen let&rsquo;s move along but uh</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s one I know about sugar Myra from</p>
<p>YouTube my sugar Cravings are bad what</p>
<p>can I do to help cure uh to curb excuse</p>
<p>me those Cravings I understood every</p>
<p>word I just said</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s my kind of question Steve</p>
<p>so um in order to cure the cravings for</p>
<p>sugar you have to get rid of the sugar</p>
<p>you cannot fix Cravings by eating sugar</p>
<p>but there is an alternative</p>
<p>um I would start to consume all the</p>
<p>sugar alcohols not alcohol but there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>sugar it&rsquo;s an alternative sugars that</p>
<p>like especially the erythritol and the</p>
<p>monk fruit seems to be a popular one in</p>
<p>certain things start using that in some</p>
<p>of these recipes and so that way you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not you&rsquo;re not stimulating the blood</p>
<p>sugar and you get the sensation of sweet</p>
<p>you get to have your cake and eat it too</p>
<p>and that way</p>
<p>um the Cravings will go down because you</p>
<p>stopped eating sugar</p>
<p>um just think about the scenario right</p>
<p>you eat sugar the blood sugars go up</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>and then insulin comes in</p>
<p>to get that Sugar out and now your blood</p>
<p>sugars come down</p>
<p>now you&rsquo;re going to want sugar</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>anything that improves your blood sugars</p>
<p>will help reduce the cravings and out of</p>
<p>all the things</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t really trigger sugar much it</p>
<p>would be</p>
<p>fiber as in vegetables and fat</p>
<p>and a moderate amount of protein is</p>
<p>going to be fine but it&rsquo;s the carbs you</p>
<p>got to get rid of the carbs and then</p>
<p>your Cravings will go away within three</p>
<p>days I will guarantee it it will work I</p>
<p>will if it doesn&rsquo;t work I&rsquo;ll give you</p>
<p>money back and he&rsquo;ll refund all your</p>
<p>misery no charge</p>
<p>okay let&rsquo;s see</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>Audrey said you pronounced it perfectly</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so proud but anyway we&rsquo;ll uh we&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>move on and Audrey we&rsquo;re going to do</p>
<p>some research on that and come back and</p>
<p>say it with a greater plume well I do</p>
<p>have a standard I have a standard answer</p>
<p>for these all the medical conditions</p>
<p>that I can&rsquo;t talk about okay just go on</p>
<p>keto</p>
<p>and intermittent fasting do the healthy</p>
<p>version and then</p>
<p>come back in a few weeks and see see how</p>
<p>you feel that&rsquo;s excellent you may not</p>
<p>have</p>
<p>as many of those symptoms as you had</p>
<p>before that&rsquo;s an excellent comeback from</p>
<p>that question and Audrey we uh so glad</p>
<p>that you called in or so to speak text</p>
<p>it in and we hope you feel terrific in</p>
<p>several weeks</p>
<p>now I&rsquo;m going to read all the way</p>
<p>through this</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>before I blurt out with some weird</p>
<p>acronym LG from YouTube how can I do</p>
<p>healthy keto if I cannot tolerate fats</p>
<p>he doesn&rsquo;t say how he can&rsquo;t tolerate</p>
<p>them but there you go yeah just what you</p>
<p>can what that means is you don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>enough bile to break down the fat</p>
<p>usually it could also mean you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have enough enzyme lipase but typically</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s you need more bile salts so you</p>
<p>want to support the gallbladder and the</p>
<p>other thing is that you don&rsquo;t have to</p>
<p>add a lot of fat for keto keto is not a</p>
<p>what makes keto is not adding more fat</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s lowering your carbs so why don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>you try to do keto with just the lower</p>
<p>amounts of fat and see how you feel that</p>
<p>might just solve your issue and then if</p>
<p>you do it the way I like I like to do it</p>
<p>with more vegetables as well that can</p>
<p>definitely curb or alter the um that</p>
<p>intolerance to Fat issue that you might</p>
<p>have</p>
<p>all right very good let&rsquo;s go</p>
<p>um to Iraq how fun to have someone from</p>
<p>Iraq and this is uh uh Zahra I hope I</p>
<p>said her name right but she&rsquo;ll correct</p>
<p>me if I didn&rsquo;t Zara you&rsquo;re on with Dr</p>
<p>bird</p>
<p>how are you yes you said my name uh</p>
<p>correctly hi Dr Berg I am happy to speak</p>
<p>to you</p>
<p>hi nice to meet you</p>
<p>I just weren&rsquo;t asking about the nerves</p>
<p>and especially the mining sheet about of</p>
<p>the nerves uh I had the Ms and the last</p>
<p>attack was on my eye nerve how to</p>
<p>improve the the mining issues because</p>
<p>so I can</p>
<p>come back yeah I mean my eye come back</p>
<p>as before uh healing combination and is</p>
<p>there any way to prevent any other</p>
<p>attack in the case of immune multiple</p>
<p>securities</p>
<p>yeah good question</p>
<p>um this is what I would I would</p>
<p>recommend you do research on</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>two things one is um to support the</p>
<p>myelin sheep it&rsquo;s the coating around the</p>
<p>nerve uh it&rsquo;s definitely a combination</p>
<p>of B12 make sure you get</p>
<p>methylcobolamine not the cyanocobolamine</p>
<p>also you can also get one with a folic</p>
<p>acid no not folic acid the folate not</p>
<p>folic acid you want folate</p>
<p>methylfolate would be good and then um</p>
<p>you you also need the benefit which is</p>
<p>the uh B1 bimhotamine is a type of B1</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s great for</p>
<p>um fixing nerve problems very important</p>
<p>and then parallel with that because you</p>
<p>mentioned Ms there&rsquo;s some really great</p>
<p>research on higher levels of vitamin D</p>
<p>and putting Ms back in remission so um</p>
<p>you need probably 50 000 a day and um</p>
<p>you know when we when you look at the</p>
<p>DNA of a lot of people vitamin D is the</p>
<p>number one</p>
<p>vitamin that most people that I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>observed have genetic issues with</p>
<p>absorbing that vitamin and also</p>
<p>converting it from the inactive to the</p>
<p>active and there&rsquo;s like several genes</p>
<p>involved and I found a lot of high</p>
<p>correlation between just the general</p>
<p>public and that and just absorbing it so</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>in the Middle East there&rsquo;s a super high</p>
<p>level of people that have low vitamin D</p>
<p>because they they&rsquo;re not getting exposed</p>
<p>to a lot of sun even though it&rsquo;s very</p>
<p>sunny over there and so you have to take</p>
<p>it as a supplement because you can&rsquo;t get</p>
<p>it from the food so I think</p>
<p>um the combination of that would help</p>
<p>you going on keto right and the last</p>
<p>thing I would mention and this is more</p>
<p>like I noticed this in practice a lot of</p>
<p>people</p>
<p>develop</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>um autoimmune diseases especially Ms</p>
<p>after stress events not that you&rsquo;ve ever</p>
<p>experienced stress before but the stress</p>
<p>event is the trigger that shuts down the</p>
<p>immune system so whatever you can do</p>
<p>whatever you can to do to reduce stress</p>
<p>and that usually helps the reoccurrence</p>
<p>of these episodes</p>
<p>all right I did that thank you you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>welcome</p>
<p>thank you thanks so much we appreciate</p>
<p>how fun to have some and I think that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>our first visitor from Iraq and you</p>
<p>represent the nation beautifully uh Zara</p>
<p>I hope you hope that you feel better</p>
<p>quickly so let&rsquo;s go back to social media</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>that was the one all right let&rsquo;s see</p>
<p>hang on Terry I think I&rsquo;ve got it Logan</p>
<p>from Facebook is it true that when the</p>
<p>gallbladder is removed the bile duct</p>
<p>stays intact</p>
<p>yeah that there&rsquo;s a tube between your</p>
<p>liver and your small intestine and on</p>
<p>the side of that there&rsquo;s a there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>supposed to be a gallbladder with a</p>
<p>connection right and so when they remove</p>
<p>the gallbladder there&rsquo;s still a tube you</p>
<p>need that tube that goes from the liver</p>
<p>into the small intestine but now without</p>
<p>a gallbladder you don&rsquo;t have the</p>
<p>regulator the the um the concentrator of</p>
<p>that cholesterol so when you eat and not</p>
<p>cholesterol but bile salts so when you</p>
<p>eat</p>
<p>you have this squirting of this bile</p>
<p>into the small intestine at a super</p>
<p>concentrated amount to be able to digest</p>
<p>the fats and to a certain level so then</p>
<p>the pancreas can take it to the next</p>
<p>level</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>bile by itself doesn&rsquo;t break down fat</p>
<p>to the smallest level that it needs to</p>
<p>be for absorption it just</p>
<p>breaks it down so then the pancreas</p>
<p>enzymes can do their magic so you could</p>
<p>potentially have a problem with the</p>
<p>pancreas that it&rsquo;s not producing the</p>
<p>lipase that you need to take it to that</p>
<p>next level so</p>
<p>you know you need both things working</p>
<p>together and um if you remove the</p>
<p>gallbladder then</p>
<p>the problem now is we don&rsquo;t have the</p>
<p>concentration so now we have this</p>
<p>diluted version of bile salts that&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just trickling down and it can it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>non-regulated so you could now you could</p>
<p>either have</p>
<p>a deficiency of the bile</p>
<p>which your stool will start floating or</p>
<p>you might have</p>
<p>too much bile that because it&rsquo;s kind of</p>
<p>draining out and then you get diarrhea</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s a situation and</p>
<p>unfortunately they take out these</p>
<p>gallbladders like there&rsquo;s like there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>no consequence but</p>
<p>now you have to deal with it I have a</p>
<p>lot of videos on it that you won&rsquo;t be</p>
<p>able to find unless you type Dr Bergen</p>
<p>gallbladder</p>
<p>all right very good okay quiz question</p>
<p>number three</p>
<p>asked which nutrient will produce the</p>
<p>fastest relief or nervous tension and</p>
<p>irritability</p>
<p>and I threw that in for a little comic</p>
<p>relief and the audience 72 percent of</p>
<p>our respondents say it&rsquo;s B1 I said that</p>
<p>20 say it&rsquo;s magnesium and eight percent</p>
<p>say it&rsquo;s vitamin d3k2</p>
<p>Steve in when I was in practice</p>
<p>um one time I had this uh</p>
<p>husband and wife come in came in and</p>
<p>they were they were fighting in the</p>
<p>waiting room so I put them in separate</p>
<p>rooms and uh I gave them both some</p>
<p>vitamin B1</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>and within four minutes</p>
<p>they were calm they were laughing they</p>
<p>were talking again they were social so</p>
<p>B1 is the answer to that and uh and so</p>
<p>if you ever feel</p>
<p>stressed anxiety nervous tension you</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t relax your mind&rsquo;s racing boy that</p>
<p>B1 is like magic you take it and get a</p>
<p>natural version of B1 and you will just</p>
<p>feel it within just a few minutes you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>feel like this sire relief you&rsquo;ll feel</p>
<p>calm you&rsquo;ll breathe better and then</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll be like shocked to find out how</p>
<p>dramatic that worked and without side</p>
<p>effects and what you have to realize is</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re probably doing something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s depleting the B1</p>
<p>and so like too much sugar too many</p>
<p>refined carbs</p>
<p>alcohol will deplete it too much coffee</p>
<p>will do it too much tea will do it oh</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>too much stress will do it so these are</p>
<p>all things that um this is why people</p>
<p>take more B1 on a regular basis it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the antidote to uh mental stress</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the answer it&rsquo;s one of the best</p>
<p>remedies and uh a lot of people don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t even know about it and uh so</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re trying other things that</p>
<p>have side effects wow and interesting</p>
<p>well I&rsquo;m currently under stress because</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m falling behind a little bit and I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>going to rely on our Lightning Fast</p>
<p>audience to get through the next two</p>
<p>questions and here&rsquo;s the fourth for the</p>
<p>day doc</p>
<p>all right what is the first sign that</p>
<p>your body is low in magnesium</p>
<p>all right eat into that audience and for</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m going back to the audience for</p>
<p>more questions Marie from YouTube what</p>
<p>do you recommend to resolve a stone in</p>
<p>my gallbladder I guess it&rsquo;s sort of</p>
<p>similar to an earlier question but</p>
<p>well what causes a stone it&rsquo;s a super</p>
<p>concentrated cholesterol Stone usually</p>
<p>and that usually occurs because the</p>
<p>ratio of bile to cholesterol is</p>
<p>incorrect what you need to do is</p>
<p>increase more bile</p>
<p>to be able to keep that cholesterol</p>
<p>Stone from being formed</p>
<p>so bile salts are the answer and that</p>
<p>brings up the question well how do we do</p>
<p>that well I have a video on that you&rsquo;d</p>
<p>have to search it out but</p>
<p>um but the bottom line is that bile</p>
<p>cells to take them after the meal purify</p>
<p>bowel salts would be a good solution to</p>
<p>help in that problem</p>
<p>all right very good let&rsquo;s see Marie from</p>
<p>YouTube what do you recommend to resolve</p>
<p>oh no I already did that I&rsquo;m sorry</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>boy there&rsquo;s a lot of bile problems today</p>
<p>audience</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>let me look a little farther back up</p>
<p>here</p>
<p>more International shout outs thank you</p>
<p>all for coming in late we don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>time to really talk about that now</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>oh Kelsey from YouTube what are your</p>
<p>thoughts about the cause and treatment</p>
<p>of Lymphedema we know what that is</p>
<p>well that&rsquo;s just that&rsquo;s uh that&rsquo;s extra</p>
<p>fluid in your lymphatic system</p>
<p>and um</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s usually it could come from a</p>
<p>hypothyroid condition</p>
<p>um the rebounder is a great exercise to</p>
<p>help push fluid out because the and</p>
<p>people use stockings in different uh</p>
<p>spent like restrictive clothing to push</p>
<p>the fluid out but</p>
<p>think about this the lymphatic system is</p>
<p>like an extension of our circulatory our</p>
<p>our vascular system</p>
<p>and so we have this arterial system that</p>
<p>dumps into the venous system and then</p>
<p>you have this backup lymphatic system</p>
<p>that is right next to it at the end of</p>
<p>your capillar as it starts to fill up</p>
<p>and so it doesn&rsquo;t have a pump it doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have a muscular Pump It Works through</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>motion movement so exercise is very very</p>
<p>therapeutic if you have lymphedema from</p>
<p>a hypothyroid condition then you need to</p>
<p>fix the thyroid and there&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>different things</p>
<p>to do for that but um</p>
<p>the rebounder is a really good remedy</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not as simple as just some some</p>
<p>simple remedy because it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a the whole system is is accumulating</p>
<p>fluid</p>
<p>all right very good Abigail from</p>
<p>Facebook I&rsquo;m trying to get pregnant I am</p>
<p>taking prenatal cod liver oil and</p>
<p>vitamin D is there anything else you&rsquo;d</p>
<p>recommend to help her on her way</p>
<p>to being a mommy</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re like royal jelly from like the</p>
<p>bees uh is a good remedy but uh and also</p>
<p>caviar is a good remedy</p>
<p>um but I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re taking uh the cod</p>
<p>liver oil and just make sure that your</p>
<p>prenatal is a food-based whole food</p>
<p>prenatal because and I don&rsquo;t I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>biased of my own but um you want to find</p>
<p>something that is actually comes from</p>
<p>nature and it&rsquo;s natural because most of</p>
<p>them are just synthetic the other thing</p>
<p>is you must must work on your diet</p>
<p>because</p>
<p>um that future child is dependent on</p>
<p>on the your nutrition at that level and</p>
<p>also the fertility is dependent on it as</p>
<p>well there&rsquo;s a lot of different</p>
<p>nutritional deficiencies that can create</p>
<p>infertility and one big one is the</p>
<p>vitamin E if you were to take um</p>
<p>tocatrinals for example that would</p>
<p>actually</p>
<p>Supply that vitamin E deficiency and you</p>
<p>would want to take a tocotrino complex</p>
<p>that would be a better than the</p>
<p>tocopherols</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>but hopefully you&rsquo;re on my version of</p>
<p>the healthy version of the ketogenic</p>
<p>diet and</p>
<p>to be able to increase your fertility</p>
<p>because that should normally do it</p>
<p>all right very good chance from YouTube</p>
<p>well wearing sunglasses outside help</p>
<p>prevent cataracts I work outside and get</p>
<p>a lot of exposure from the Sun thank you</p>
<p>he says that&rsquo;s jazz</p>
<p>I think I would there are blue blockers</p>
<p>and things like that that can help that</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a lot of benefits from Sun</p>
<p>like the infrared as well so yeah you</p>
<p>can probably wear some type of blue</p>
<p>blocker to help curb that but don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>forget these cataracts can also come</p>
<p>from a nutritional angle so</p>
<p>you want to have um</p>
<p>foods high in antioxidants especially</p>
<p>like salads and vegetables and things</p>
<p>like that intermittent fasting is very</p>
<p>important too to build up your own</p>
<p>antioxidants but also be careful about</p>
<p>all the screen time behind computers</p>
<p>cell phones laptops TV all that will</p>
<p>really increase the risk of getting the</p>
<p>cataracts</p>
<p>um I talked I have several videos of</p>
<p>cataracts that you won&rsquo;t be able to find</p>
<p>unless you type Dr Berg and I give some</p>
<p>great uh data on that as well because</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a there&rsquo;s a bit of a um</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s called um</p>
<p>glycation</p>
<p>usually comes from the diet eating too</p>
<p>many carbs but glycation affects the</p>
<p>protein in that part of the lens and it</p>
<p>becomes opaque and it occurs with aging</p>
<p>but if you actually go on the the eating</p>
<p>plan that I recommend I think that would</p>
<p>be the best prevention</p>
<p>all right very good quiz question number</p>
<p>four asks what is the first sign in your</p>
<p>body that&rsquo;s low on magnesium</p>
<p>and uh</p>
<p>eighty percent eighty percent this time</p>
<p>say uh muscle fatigue or cramping ten</p>
<p>percent say constipation and ten percent</p>
<p>say poor Sleep Quality</p>
<p>okay so there&rsquo;s a thing called the</p>
<p>mitochondria</p>
<p>the mitochondria is the energy factor of</p>
<p>the cell</p>
<p>a lot of those enzymes in that</p>
<p>mitochondria that make up energy require</p>
<p>magnesium</p>
<p>ATP the energy currency of the body is</p>
<p>dependent on magnesium so the app the</p>
<p>the Magnesium allows you to have the</p>
<p>power to power the muscles the nervous</p>
<p>system and if you don&rsquo;t have that power</p>
<p>you end up with</p>
<p>things like arrhythmias</p>
<p>cramping but the first symptom of a</p>
<p>magnesium deficiency is fatigue</p>
<p>Relentless fatigue you just don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>the energy and I mean</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s at least one</p>
<p>personality that&rsquo;s tired right now</p>
<p>um instead of running out into buying</p>
<p>magnesium you could just start</p>
<p>increasing foods high in magnesium so</p>
<p>anything with chlorophyll and that would</p>
<p>be the green stuff</p>
<p>like leafy greens big salads</p>
<p>but not lime green Jello or pistachio</p>
<p>ice cream Steam</p>
<p>all right well why don&rsquo;t we use iceberg</p>
<p>lettuce in that group does that have</p>
<p>anything good for you in it</p>
<p>iceberg lettuce is literally</p>
<p>it looks like it&rsquo;s a food but there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not much going on inside yeah that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what I figured okay quiz question</p>
<p>number four let&rsquo;s see I&rsquo;m sorry quiz</p>
<p>question number five let&rsquo;s get to that</p>
<p>Doc it&rsquo;s our last one for the day it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>good one</p>
<p>this is a hard one I don&rsquo;t know if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna get this true or false</p>
<p>YouTube&rsquo;s new health uh policy supports</p>
<p>objective unbiased health information</p>
<p>with no ties to conflicts of interest</p>
<p>what else could it be for goodness sakes</p>
<p>all right dig into that real quick</p>
<p>audience Maria from YouTube what&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>best way to resolve constipation from</p>
<p>doing Keto</p>
<p>well I think when we deal with</p>
<p>constipation we have to look at the</p>
<p>microbes right we have to look at the</p>
<p>microbes and also the shift in diet are</p>
<p>you doing too much protein that can</p>
<p>definitely</p>
<p>create some constipation with some</p>
<p>people because you&rsquo;re now not</p>
<p>maybe feeding the microbes enough uh the</p>
<p>fiber that needs from the salad right so</p>
<p>um but I think a good remedy for</p>
<p>constipation uh because now there&rsquo;s a I</p>
<p>think there&rsquo;s a shortage of laxatives</p>
<p>uh or no stool stool softeners</p>
<p>so we really need to stock up on those</p>
<p>right Steve</p>
<p>um but a good remedy for that would be</p>
<p>uh probiotics okay probiotics is the</p>
<p>best remedy but you can even get get it</p>
<p>from food like fermented sauerkraut at</p>
<p>each meal have a cup of that Watch What</p>
<p>Happens uh Kefir is way better than</p>
<p>yogurt make sure you get the unflavored</p>
<p>unsweetened uh plain boring whole fat</p>
<p>kefir from a goat or a sheep if possible</p>
<p>um but I have kefir every single day and</p>
<p>sauerkraut so it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s the antidote to</p>
<p>this constipation especially if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>on keto a fermented vegetable or a dairy</p>
<p>all right very good well we have a</p>
<p>consensus true false YouTube&rsquo;s new</p>
<p>health policy supports objective</p>
<p>unbiased health information with no ties</p>
<p>or conflicts of interest well doc they</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t believe that the 100 of them say</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just simply not true there&rsquo;s more</p>
<p>to this picture than meets the eye</p>
<p>okay all right well that&rsquo;s uh</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s good that&rsquo;s good good information</p>
<p>is great and we are hustling folks</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not going to lose Dr Berger</p>
<p>promise you if anything we&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>have more ways for you to watch him</p>
<p>um and he&rsquo;ll have continued freedom to</p>
<p>give you some great health benefits to</p>
<p>following these various things and again</p>
<p>I am much much healthier and happier</p>
<p>than before I met Dr Berg I will contest</p>
<p>from my own results that it&rsquo;s just a</p>
<p>terrific way of improving your mood and</p>
<p>your health hands down Kathy from</p>
<p>Facebook how can I get rid of a swollen</p>
<p>lymph gland in the neck just under the</p>
<p>jaw it&rsquo;s been there for five months no</p>
<p>pain but my voice occasionally</p>
<p>gets hoarse could it be sinus drainage</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something really interesting</p>
<p>about that because</p>
<p>um in practice I did some experimenting</p>
<p>on people that have sore throats or</p>
<p>swollen lymph glands or in large lymph</p>
<p>glands when they don&rsquo;t really have an</p>
<p>infection</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>when you were in high school maybe you</p>
<p>had what&rsquo;s called Epstein-Barr virus</p>
<p>which does tend to can come back out of</p>
<p>remission and</p>
<p>not create a full-blown infection but it</p>
<p>can actually create maybe a swollen</p>
<p>lymph node or a sore throat most sore</p>
<p>throats are actually viral</p>
<p>um not necessarily bacterial that&rsquo;s why</p>
<p>antibiotics don&rsquo;t work for sore throats</p>
<p>most of the time</p>
<p>um but the point is that</p>
<p>there is a technique</p>
<p>um that you won&rsquo;t find unless you type</p>
<p>Dr Berg&rsquo;s sore throat where you put this</p>
<p>pressure maybe um someone in your house</p>
<p>can can duplicate this but you want them</p>
<p>to put pressure</p>
<p>you first of all point where the sore</p>
<p>throat is and draw a line around the</p>
<p>back of your neck and have them apply</p>
<p>pressure on the exact Mirror Image</p>
<p>opposite side in your neck at the level</p>
<p>of the sore throat and hold that</p>
<p>pressure for two minutes you&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>find the lymph node draining you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to find that sore throat kind of</p>
<p>easing up but the key is hitting those</p>
<p>exact opposite points which</p>
<p>once you find them the way that you know</p>
<p>you find them is it&rsquo;ll be very very</p>
<p>extra tender in that area so feel the</p>
<p>tenderness hold the pressure I have a</p>
<p>device that I use to do it on myself</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a handheld massage device I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have it around here but you can look</p>
<p>look at that on my website too if you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have someone to do it on you but</p>
<p>but boy that&rsquo;s a great thing to help</p>
<p>kind of just open up the the energy</p>
<p>flows to your neck and the tightness</p>
<p>that can</p>
<p>the residual from</p>
<p>maybe years of that area of your of your</p>
<p>body stressing out from various things</p>
<p>like viruses coming in and out of</p>
<p>remission well speaking of years of</p>
<p>extra mask as they call themselves from</p>
<p>YouTube I have one functional kidney</p>
<p>from birth I&rsquo;ve had no issues so far but</p>
<p>I need to watch my creatine levels is</p>
<p>keto compatible with my situation</p>
<p>well take a look at the number one cause</p>
<p>of kidney disease</p>
<p>it is a high carb diet that causes</p>
<p>diabetes</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m not talking about</p>
<p>healthy carbs like salads and vegetables</p>
<p>and things like that I&rsquo;m talking about</p>
<p>refined foods and also having hyper</p>
<p>glycemia high sugar that is the the</p>
<p>killer of the kidney so guess what keto</p>
<p>is it&rsquo;s the opposite of that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going on low carbs which is very very</p>
<p>healthy for the kidney but don&rsquo;t forget</p>
<p>to do the healthy version of the</p>
<p>ketogenic diet which involves a lot of</p>
<p>vegetables which will give you the</p>
<p>potassium which is very protective of</p>
<p>the kidney the nice thing about what you</p>
<p>have is that you can survive very well</p>
<p>with one kidney because it compensated</p>
<p>but sometimes people</p>
<p>through misinformation say that oh we</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t need to overdo the potassium</p>
<p>because</p>
<p>um you know I heard asking the factory</p>
<p>no that&rsquo;s not true potassium is only bad</p>
<p>if you have a stage five kidney disease</p>
<p>more potassium is protected against the</p>
<p>kidney</p>
<p>um especially</p>
<p>um if you only have one</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s my answer and on that note I</p>
<p>want to thank everyone for watching I</p>
<p>appreciate your attention stay tuned for</p>
<p>more videos</p>
<p>um and I will see you next week same</p>
<p>time same place</p>
<p>[Music]</p>
<p>thank you</p>
