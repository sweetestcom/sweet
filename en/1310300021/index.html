    <p>This is an All Ears English podcast, episode 1908. Three native English grammar mistakes to avoid.</p>
<p>Welcome to the All Ears English podcast downloaded more than 200 million times.</p>
<p>Are you feeling stuck with your English? We&rsquo;ll show you how to become fearless and fluent by</p>
<p>focusing on connection, not perfection with your American host, Aubrey Carter, the IELTS whiz,</p>
<p>and Lindsay McMahon, the English adventurer, coming to you from Arizona and Colorado, USA.</p>
<p>And to get your transcripts delivered by email every week, go to allearsenglish.com forward slash</p>
<p>subscribe. What would you do if you heard someone say, we might can do that? When native English</p>
<p>speakers make grammar mistakes, it can be difficult to know how to react. Today we</p>
<p>share three common grammar mistakes made by native speakers and what you should do when you hear them.</p>
<p>Lindsay, what&rsquo;s a grammar mistake that you&rsquo;ve heard a native make that kind of caught you</p>
<p>off guard? Oh, good question, Aubrey. So a few weeks ago I was on the phone with our lawyer.</p>
<p>We working with a lawyer for my aunt is getting older. We&rsquo;re getting her things organized.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a lawyer. He&rsquo;s a smart guy. He&rsquo;s been to law school. It&rsquo;s not easy to pass the bar.</p>
<p>Very smart guy, sharp as anything. In the middle of the conversation, we&rsquo;re talking about different</p>
<p>assets and all of these things. And he goes, you might can combine these two assets and put them</p>
<p>in. And I thought, oh my gosh, what just happened? What? What? Excuse me. Come again. Yeah. Come</p>
<p>again. Excuse me. Right. But obviously I didn&rsquo;t correct him. He&rsquo;s a native speaker of English.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re having a complicated discussion where I don&rsquo;t understand half of what he says because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s too lawyerly. Right. He does have a deep Southern accent. I&rsquo;m not exactly sure where he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>from, but I know that he knows what he&rsquo;s doing. However, he still made that mistake.</p>
<p>Which doesn&rsquo;t surprise me at all, because where I grew up in rural Idaho, we absolutely say that</p>
<p>you might can do this. You might can get that. Oh, absolutely.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t as used to hearing it, to be honest. Yeah.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s a regional dialect, right? These are colloquialisms that are very accepted and</p>
<p>common in certain regions, especially of the United States. So the ones we&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>today, but they are, that&rsquo;s not every region. So depending on where you grew up, these will</p>
<p>sound very wrong, very ungrammatical. So we don&rsquo;t recommend you use them, but we do have an important</p>
<p>recommendation for you about them. Right, Lindsay? Yeah. We just want you guys to be ready. You know,</p>
<p>on this podcast, again, we don&rsquo;t limit you to textbook English. We&rsquo;re going to show you all</p>
<p>the English you&rsquo;re likely to hear and show you what you might want to pick up and what you might</p>
<p>want to leave down and not choose to use. Right. And it&rsquo;s important to know, like you said, Lindsay,</p>
<p>you would never correct him, right? Never. Because it&rsquo;s very accepted regional colloquial language.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t even notice he made that. It would have been very awkward if you corrected him and he</p>
<p>might even disagree and say, you know, I&rsquo;m just speaking. This is accepted speech. It would be</p>
<p>offensive. And also, I mean, it would cost me money because lawyers charge $500 an hour.</p>
<p>I needed the information. I&rsquo;m not going to waste time correcting someone&rsquo;s grammar.</p>
<p>Oh, no. So save time and money, guys, by knowing about these phrases.</p>
<p>Exactly. So we just moved on. I mean, it&rsquo;s totally irrelevant when you get to this point. So let&rsquo;s go</p>
<p>through two or three of these for our listeners today. This is going to be a fun episode.</p>
<p>Yes, for sure. So the first one is the one that our attorney used. You might can, which really</p>
<p>means you might be able to. But because it&rsquo;s those three words, four syllables, be able to,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re shortening it to you might can. You might can get them to agree with you.</p>
<p>Yeah. And I guess that&rsquo;s why. Right. You know, sometimes I try to get in the person&rsquo;s head. Why</p>
<p>did they decide to say that instead? Even though he obviously knows it&rsquo;s wrong. Why did he decide</p>
<p>not to say you might be able to? I guess it&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s shorter. Right. He&rsquo;s saving my</p>
<p>time, which I appreciate. And it&rsquo;s just accepted in his regional dialect. I guarantee you all of</p>
<p>his neighbors say it. His parents say it. It sounds wrong to him when someone doesn&rsquo;t say it.</p>
<p>But you know what&rsquo;s funny, though? He lives in San Francisco now.</p>
<p>Well, so he probably. So it&rsquo;s so hard to get rid of it, though. Right. There are some things that</p>
<p>I still every now and then say. And everyone who lives by me is like, excuse me, what?</p>
<p>Yeah. Yeah. I love it. I love it. All right. What else, Aubrey?</p>
<p>Well, so interesting about that. I would maybe say that, but I would be more likely to say</p>
<p>you maybe can. You maybe can combine this. Right. So there are these two options.</p>
<p>Both are very informal speech. I do not recommend you guys use them at work. Wherever you are,</p>
<p>it might be flagged to a native speaker as wrong. And they&rsquo;ll know that could be part of</p>
<p>your regional dialect. But it is it does sound ungrammatical. So don&rsquo;t use it. But where you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to hear you might can and you maybe can. You maybe can do that. You know, it doesn&rsquo;t sound</p>
<p>as bad to me. Maybe a little better because it feels like we&rsquo;re taking two things that separately</p>
<p>totally work. And it just feels less off. And it might even be less ungrammatical,</p>
<p>at least because maybe where it&rsquo;s an adverb, you can stick it wherever. Right. It&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>necessarily incorrect, whereas might can is a little less like you can&rsquo;t just put that wherever</p>
<p>you want in a sentence. Unfortunately, painful, painful on the ears. It&rsquo;s like, what&rsquo;s that</p>
<p>expression? It&rsquo;s like nails on a chalkboard. Exactly right. That&rsquo;s a good idiom of something</p>
<p>that really gets under your skin really bothers you guys. Write that one down again. I think</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a good note really quick that you you don&rsquo;t want to judge. Right. Even if it&rsquo;s a pet peeve,</p>
<p>even if it is nails on a chalkboard, you want to be careful not to say something judgmental or give</p>
<p>them a look like, what did you just say? Right. We just you know what? It&rsquo;s OK. It&rsquo;s spoken speech.</p>
<p>Move on. Don&rsquo;t worry about it. Move on and move on to the content. Right. In a way, we don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>time for this. Right. Guys, it comes back to connection. I don&rsquo;t want to lose the relationship</p>
<p>with the lawyer. I don&rsquo;t want to lose my understanding of what he&rsquo;s saying. Right. I</p>
<p>needed to maximize every second of that hour, that expensive hour to make sure I understand</p>
<p>what we&rsquo;re doing here. So it comes back to connection. Exactly. So there&rsquo;s a second one</p>
<p>very similar to say you might could do that. Right. These are all very similar.</p>
<p>You might can you might could you baby could. Right. And this means you might be able to do</p>
<p>that. So you might could meet up after work. I say this. I hear it. It probably sounds very wrong</p>
<p>to you, Lindsay, but it&rsquo;s part of my regional dialect. And guys, remember, again, just to make</p>
<p>sure it&rsquo;s clear, we&rsquo;re going to say this a few times today. We&rsquo;re not saying you should use this</p>
<p>right. We&rsquo;re saying we&rsquo;re saying you should be ready to hear it and move on and come back to the</p>
<p>content and the human connection. OK, another one, Aubrey, they might could find a babysitter.</p>
<p>You might hear that. Right. Yes. I heard a friend say not that not that long when I was in Idaho</p>
<p>this summer, we needed some friends to find a babysitter. And my sister was like, they might</p>
<p>could find a babysitter if they start calling now. Absolutely. Oh, it&rsquo;s so funny. It&rsquo;s so funny.</p>
<p>OK, Aubrey, what else do we need to know? Is there a third thing that we might want to watch</p>
<p>out for here? Yeah. So used to could, which just means used to be able to this, we say in Idaho.</p>
<p>I feel like most of the time when I ask someone, do you guys say this? They say no. So I think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>rural northwest maybe for the most part. But I would love for you guys to let me know if you hear</p>
<p>this anywhere else. Leave a comment. We say it to you know, would say you used to could turn right</p>
<p>there, but they changed the stoplight. So instead of saying used to be able to, we shorten that to</p>
<p>used to could. Yeah. Or you used to could hike there, but it&rsquo;s now closed. This makes me think</p>
<p>a lot of if you take a tour of a town with someone who&rsquo;s lived there their whole lives,</p>
<p>for example, and they can&rsquo;t help but go down memory lane about, oh, you used to could be</p>
<p>able to used to could park there. And I put be able to in there because it didn&rsquo;t sound right to</p>
<p>me. I know I could tell it&rsquo;s a very foreign to your region. But yeah, people that like to live</p>
<p>in the past, right, they might be likely, especially if they&rsquo;re older, maybe don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>listen to a ton of media or who knows, they might say this or it&rsquo;s just part of it&rsquo;s just a habit.</p>
<p>Right. And I do want to highlight in that they say used to used to could. And even though it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>smushed all together, we often get questions about used to and used to without the D.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah. And Jessica and I recently recorded an episode about this for IELTS Energy.</p>
<p>Yeah. You likely have this question. What&rsquo;s the difference? So go check that one out. It&rsquo;s 989.</p>
<p>Should you say used to or used to? Yes. Give you some really good details about keeping them apart.</p>
<p>Yeah. Keep them apart. This is a question I used to get all the time when I would work</p>
<p>one on one with students in New York City all the time, especially for you guys at your level.</p>
<p>So that one is over on IELTS Energy podcast. Yes, exactly. Right. If you&rsquo;re not following,</p>
<p>be sure to follow IELTS Energy. Even if you&rsquo;re not studying for the IELTS exam,</p>
<p>we talk about grammar and vocab and idioms. There&rsquo;s lots of great info over there. So I</p>
<p>recommend the IELTS Energy podcast. Me too. And guys, that podcast is downloaded around a million</p>
<p>times a month. So it&rsquo;s a huge show. Right. You&rsquo;re going to have lots of listening company over</p>
<p>there if you hit follow on that show. Good stuff. Yes, for sure. Let&rsquo;s do a role play, Lindsay,</p>
<p>so that you guys can hear these. We&rsquo;re doing two different ways here. It&rsquo;s a little different.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to do a role play that&rsquo;s very informal that I might hear in my hometown.</p>
<p>And then we&rsquo;ll share the role play of what this would sound like with correct grammar. And this</p>
<p>is how we recommend you say these things. And I did add maybe to say like, I could maybe do that</p>
<p>because in speech, I think that&rsquo;s acceptable. All right. I&rsquo;m ready. Here we go. All right.</p>
<p>So here we&rsquo;re discussing, just like you were saying, the changes to a town where we both</p>
<p>grew up. You used to could play in a park over there, but it&rsquo;s been replaced by apartments.</p>
<p>Oh, such a bummer. They might could add a new park on the corner there.</p>
<p>Yeah, I might can ask someone if that&rsquo;s in the works. You can&rsquo;t even do it without laughing.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t even do it without faking kind of a country accent or something. It&rsquo;s almost like</p>
<p>I have to put an accent in there. You&rsquo;re so judgmental. You&rsquo;re judgmental of us country bumpkins.</p>
<p>I know, but I can&rsquo;t do it. I can&rsquo;t. So all right, let&rsquo;s go through it. Show our listeners where we</p>
<p>used these mistakes. Yes. So I first said you used to could play, which means you used to be</p>
<p>able to play in the park over there. Right. And then I said, such a bummer. They might could</p>
<p>add a new park. Again, it feels so unnatural. Might could add a new park on the corner there.</p>
<p>You definitely would say they might be able to add a new park.</p>
<p>Exactly. Or just they might. They might add a new park.</p>
<p>And then you said one. Yeah, I might can ask someone. I might can ask someone if it&rsquo;s in</p>
<p>the works, meaning like I might call and see if I know someone who I might can do that.</p>
<p>I love it. But why do you think that like you could also just say I can ask someone I can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>or I could. Why do you think it seems like the pattern is here that we like to add might</p>
<p>in front of everything? You know what I mean? That was more that I&rsquo;m trying to squeeze them</p>
<p>all into a role play. OK, because you wouldn&rsquo;t have you. You probably wouldn&rsquo;t say I might be</p>
<p>able to ask someone, though. I think my thought when I was writing that was imagine, you know,</p>
<p>someone on town council. Right. And so you don&rsquo;t say like I can ask someone you&rsquo;re thinking like,</p>
<p>hmm, I might be able to ask someone because you&rsquo;re thinking of this person you maybe know</p>
<p>that you could ask. OK, got it. Got it. All right. Cool. Now, guys, we&rsquo;re going to give</p>
<p>you the correct grammar, right? Let&rsquo;s go through it again. Here we go. OK, so here I am. You used</p>
<p>to be able to play in a park over there, but it&rsquo;s been replaced by apartments. Such a bummer.</p>
<p>They maybe could add a new park on the corner there. Yeah, I can maybe ask someone if that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>in the works. OK, so here we&rsquo;re putting maybe and could together. Right. So we still had the</p>
<p>you used to be able to play. And the first thing that I said, that&rsquo;s the full longer.</p>
<p>And, you know, but you will hear this. I think that&rsquo;s what you would say,</p>
<p>Lindsay. Right. You would take that extra step. I would to take a little longer. Yeah,</p>
<p>it does take a little longer. It&rsquo;s a little more wordy and annoying on the tongue. Right. To say it</p>
<p>is more work. Yeah. Feels like there should be one word for these four words. Yeah, it&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s true. And then I said such a bummer they maybe could add a park. So we&rsquo;re saying that</p>
<p>this is OK to say they maybe could add. Yes, it&rsquo;s still informal speech, but we speak informally at</p>
<p>work. I say this. I hear this at work unless I mean, if you&rsquo;re in a job interview or if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s formal writing. Yeah. And I would say they may be able to add a new park. Right. I</p>
<p>would speak or write more formally. Right. But other than that, this is a little informal,</p>
<p>but it is correct. Yeah. What I would tend to say here is I would say maybe they could add a new</p>
<p>park. Maybe they could starting with maybe start with the adverb. Yeah, that makes sense. Yeah. And</p>
<p>then I said I can maybe ask someone and say I could say maybe I can ask someone. And I think</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re right. I probably would have more of a tendency to say the maybe first. Yeah, I love it.</p>
<p>OK. So, Aubrey, what is the takeaway for our listeners today? What do we think?</p>
<p>Well, first of all, I think it&rsquo;s such a vital soft skill to be able to hear a grammar mistake</p>
<p>and not react, not judge, not correct. Just move on, like we said. Right. It shows empathy and</p>
<p>compassion. Yeah. Build connections. I think that&rsquo;s pretty vital. And don&rsquo;t show it in your</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t show it in your face. Don&rsquo;t flinch. Right. No reaction. Don&rsquo;t make a face. Just human</p>
<p>connection. Right. Because we want this to write. This is the whole idea. As you guys are learning</p>
<p>English as a second language or as a third language or twelfth language. Right. You want</p>
<p>to not be judged. Right. Again, it&rsquo;s the other side. You want that person to come back to the</p>
<p>content and the connection of what you are saying. So we want to do the same thing with</p>
<p>native speakers who might just be having fun with how they grew up and they never took it out of</p>
<p>their language. Yeah. And imagine doing the opposite. And that, you know, criticizing,</p>
<p>judging, correcting can really break down or ruin connections. It creates awkwardness.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s no one likes to be criticized. And like you said, might be being silly or they might</p>
<p>not even notice because they&rsquo;re so used to this error that&rsquo;s accepted in their regional dialect.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want to risk that risk hurting the relationship, the connection.</p>
<p>Yeah. I mean, that&rsquo;s what I love about this show. Right. We come back to connection. We</p>
<p>come back to the value the person has beyond just the words they&rsquo;re saying. Right. Like my lawyer</p>
<p>knows so much about a state law that I want to get every word. I want to get every piece of</p>
<p>information. I&rsquo;m hanging on every word because I don&rsquo;t understand 80 percent of it anyways. And I</p>
<p>need to ask it to be repeated over and over again. You know, a brilliant mathematician might make this</p>
<p>mistake, but they&rsquo;re brilliant. Right. So it&rsquo;s not the words. It&rsquo;s what they have to share.</p>
<p>Exactly. It&rsquo;s just like us. We make grammar mistakes sometimes,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s not the most important thing, because we have to share is more important.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t essentialize people. Right. Right. They&rsquo;re more than their words. So good.</p>
<p>Good stuff. Very interesting today. Thanks for bringing this up and sharing this stuff,</p>
<p>Aubrey. Good stuff. Lindsay, I&rsquo;ll see you next time. Talk to you soon. Have a good one. Bye.</p>
