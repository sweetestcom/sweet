    <p>Hey everybody, welcome to the All In Podcast.</p>
<p>This is our fifth episode.</p>
<p>As you know, we regularly publish this podcast,</p>
<p>well, every two to four weeks, something like that.</p>
<p>And just to give you a little idea</p>
<p>of how well this is going,</p>
<p>the podcast peaked at number 10 in tech podcasts,</p>
<p>even though we never publish it,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re only four episodes in.</p>
<p>Number 10?</p>
<p>So tell your friends about the podcast</p>
<p>so we can be number one</p>
<p>and just dunk on traditional media,</p>
<p>which is full of people who have us as the guests.</p>
<p>Jason, number 10 on what, Apple?</p>
<p>Apple Technology Podcasts.</p>
<p>We literally raced.</p>
<p>I mean, it went from like,</p>
<p>we debuted in the 20s, then the teens,</p>
<p>and then boom, we hit number 10.</p>
<p>And I was talking to somebody in media</p>
<p>who has us on as guests,</p>
<p>and I was like, listen, I formed a super team</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re now getting more traffic.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, who are you talking to?</p>
<p>Just like a mirror where you were just looking at yourself?</p>
<p>I mean, you are so fucking arrogant</p>
<p>after that shitty video.</p>
<p>What video are you referring to?</p>
<p>What video are you referring to?</p>
<p>Oh my God, oh look, you want me to say it</p>
<p>to all the listeners?</p>
<p>You want me to say it?</p>
<p>All right, hold on a second.</p>
<p>Let me just kind of skim through the housekeeping.</p>
<p>Somebody made a cut of the billion times</p>
<p>Jason mentioned he was an early investor in Uber.</p>
<p>All right, take it easy,</p>
<p>Virgin Galactic slash Slack investor.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t say anything.</p>
<p>I mean, I have a lot of companies I could mention.</p>
<p>Yeah, they just put it on the Chiron,</p>
<p>the lower third, every time you&rsquo;re on CNBC, everybody.</p>
<p>My problem is I have too many unicorns</p>
<p>to mention just one.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t know which one to mention.</p>
<p>They just go with PayPal and Knows Peter Thiel.</p>
<p>David, David, I have a question.</p>
<p>Why is there a picture of two pregnant men</p>
<p>behind you on Zoom?</p>
<p>We now have the technology for men to be impregnated.</p>
<p>This is a recent picture of Jason and I on the golf course.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure who&rsquo;s more out of shape.</p>
<p>Are you on the first hole?</p>
<p>You look like you&rsquo;re about to collapse.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>In fairness, in fairness, it&rsquo;s 106 degrees.</p>
<p>Two minutes later, the guy behind him</p>
<p>has put his hands under his shoulders and holds him up.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s 106 degrees at 80% humidity.</p>
<p>And I kid you not, this was the second</p>
<p>and third time I played golf.</p>
<p>This was the third time.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m gonna just ask, David Freeburg is here, of course.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s our science friend, buddy.</p>
<p>And Chamath Palihapitiya is here.</p>
<p>How many holes?</p>
<p>I want one of you to set the over under.</p>
<p>Set the over on how many holes we completed each day.</p>
<p>The maximum number of holes we completed.</p>
<p>Four, okay.</p>
<p>Chamath set the line at four,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re taking the over.</p>
<p>It was, Sax?</p>
<p>Five.</p>
<p>Five.</p>
<p>Oh!</p>
<p>And actually, there&rsquo;s a red door every five holes.</p>
<p>So that may have had something to do with it.</p>
<p>I took nine because I figured Jason</p>
<p>was on his rush to the hot dog stand.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s where, the red door</p>
<p>is where the hot dogs are.</p>
<p>No, you know what?</p>
<p>I said these two dorks with ADHD</p>
<p>can barely make it an hour doing anything.</p>
<p>And so if you think an average round takes four hours,</p>
<p>then basically, you know, you get through four holes</p>
<p>in about an hour, and then you want to give up.</p>
<p>We got to the fifth hole.</p>
<p>I am addicted to golf now.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you guys know this.</p>
<p>You can gamble on golf.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard that.</p>
<p>The biggest match I ever played</p>
<p>was a $500,000 million NASA.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what a NASA is.</p>
<p>I lost one and a half bets.</p>
<p>I lost 750K.</p>
<p>What is a NASA type bet?</p>
<p>NASA&rsquo;s just basically a gambling bet on a per hole basis.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>We had just a ton of fun, and it was great</p>
<p>because this was the first time I&rsquo;ve ever-</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the single best aspect of golf, in my opinion.</p>
<p>If you gamble, it makes that game</p>
<p>one of the most incredible games</p>
<p>because people with mental fortitude</p>
<p>who cannot play at all can show up</p>
<p>and literally make hundreds of thousands</p>
<p>or millions of dollars.</p>
<p>Yeah, we were playing for hundreds of dollars per hole,</p>
<p>so let&rsquo;s just leave it at that.</p>
<p>In fact, we were playing $100 a hole,</p>
<p>so it was just for fun.</p>
<p>But man, I don&rsquo;t know about you guys.</p>
<p>If we know somebody who&rsquo;s got a membership</p>
<p>in one of these places, I&rsquo;d love to go back out again,</p>
<p>but it was great fun, and it was a fun show.</p>
<p>Come to Shadow Creek in Vegas.</p>
<p>We can play.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably the best gambling golf course</p>
<p>in the world, in my opinion.</p>
<p>Okay, I&rsquo;m in.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s get to business.</p>
<p>For those of you who are tuning in for the first time,</p>
<p>Chamath Palihapitiya is my co-host here on the podcast.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been friends since we both did</p>
<p>a very brief tour at AOL.</p>
<p>He then went to work for Mayfield,</p>
<p>which is a venture firm you might not have heard of.</p>
<p>He stayed there for about 27 weeks</p>
<p>before going to work for Mark Zuckerberg.</p>
<p>He secured the bag, then started his own venture firm.</p>
<p>It grew way too big, and he kind of got bored</p>
<p>having to manage 100 people.</p>
<p>So now he&rsquo;s running his home office venture firm</p>
<p>and doing two deals a year.</p>
<p>The one you&rsquo;ve certainly heard of is Virgin Galactic,</p>
<p>where he&rsquo;s taking people to space,</p>
<p>and he did a SPAC for that.</p>
<p>IPOB and IPOC are lined up from what I understand,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;ll correct me if I am wrong,</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;ll be SPACing two more companies once a year,</p>
<p>I guess will be the pace.</p>
<p>Is that correct, Chamath?</p>
<p>Among other things, but yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, and then David Sachs has now become,</p>
<p>and David Freeberg have become regulars.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve decided we&rsquo;re gonna stick with this foursome</p>
<p>as it goes, because we&rsquo;re getting a really nice</p>
<p>passing of the ball around topics.</p>
<p>And David Sachs went to Stanford with folks</p>
<p>you know like Keith Raboi, Peter Thiel,</p>
<p>during an era where they were a bunch of huge nerds</p>
<p>who created a way to transfer money</p>
<p>on PalmPilots called PayPal.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t work until they decided to move it to email.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure whose idea,</p>
<p>who gets credit for moving it to email, Sachs?</p>
<p>Sachs.</p>
<p>Who decided like, hey, I don&rsquo;t know, maybe-</p>
<p>Sachs&rsquo; silence is his way of saying me.</p>
<p>Because it was an abject failure</p>
<p>when you tried to send money between PalmPilots,</p>
<p>Peter Thiel&rsquo;s original idea,</p>
<p>but then somebody woke up and said,</p>
<p>well, why don&rsquo;t we just do this over email?</p>
<p>What he hasn&rsquo;t said, let me tell you the names</p>
<p>at PayPal he has not said yet.</p>
<p>Musk, Thiel, Hoffman, Levchin,</p>
<p>silence, radio silence so far, David Sachs.</p>
<p>Jeremy Stoppelman, Chad Hurley from YouTube,</p>
<p>Jerry Stoppman from Yelp.</p>
<p>Anyway, he was part of that cohort.</p>
<p>Then he made a movie called Thank You for Smoking,</p>
<p>which was Jason Reitman&rsquo;s first film.</p>
<p>Jason Reitman then went on to great success.</p>
<p>That film actually made money.</p>
<p>Sachs was so absolutely depressed</p>
<p>by how long it took to make one film</p>
<p>and how painful it was.</p>
<p>He then decided to go create a billion dollar company</p>
<p>in under three years called Yammer,</p>
<p>which Chamath made a ton of money on</p>
<p>and he cackles about regularly.</p>
<p>And then David Freeberg is with us.</p>
<p>He is just the smartest kid at the table,</p>
<p>but somehow figures out how to lose tons of money</p>
<p>to us in poker.</p>
<p>He created climate.com and sold it to Monsanto.</p>
<p>He created Metro Mile and he created Eatsa,</p>
<p>which failed horribly, but that just goes to show you</p>
<p>nobody even remembers what Eatsa is,</p>
<p>but they do remember his giant multi-billion dollar</p>
<p>companies and he now is running his own startup studio,</p>
<p>which is making incredibly interesting companies.</p>
<p>Can I talk about the one that&rsquo;s related</p>
<p>to beverages or not?</p>
<p>Not yet.</p>
<p>Okay, anyway, there&rsquo;s a company related to beverages</p>
<p>that is so game changing.</p>
<p>He just said no.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t say it.</p>
<p>He showed it to us under Frendier.</p>
<p>I just said, can I talk about the beverage company,</p>
<p>yes or no?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to give the guy a goddamn plug here.</p>
<p>But anyway, he said no, so you can&rsquo;t do a plug.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not doing a plug, but I&rsquo;m teasing it</p>
<p>and I think he&rsquo;s literally sitting on</p>
<p>what could wind up being the greatest,</p>
<p>most successful company of the entire group, period.</p>
<p>Okay, let&rsquo;s jump in.</p>
<p>I wanna talk about, David, you sold Climate to Monsanto</p>
<p>for a billion dollars back in the day</p>
<p>when it was shocking to people, that amount of money.</p>
<p>Still is, but you were one of the first</p>
<p>sort of quote unquote unicorns.</p>
<p>And then you were right in the front seat of Monsanto,</p>
<p>probably could have been CEO if you wanted.</p>
<p>I want you to talk to me about what is going on</p>
<p>with Bayer, Monsanto, Roundup, and I wanna use that</p>
<p>as a jumping off point to talk about</p>
<p>the World Health Organization.</p>
<p>So Roundup is a molecule known as glyphosate</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s been used as a herbicide for decades.</p>
<p>And for decades, it was very well studied.</p>
<p>The US EPA and the FDA and USDA</p>
<p>and global health organizations have studied it carefully</p>
<p>because of its incredible use.</p>
<p>It biodegrades, the core molecule glyphosate biodegrades</p>
<p>in a couple of days and it is a very effective herbicide.</p>
<p>So when farmers grow stuff,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t want weeds growing in the field</p>
<p>and Roundup was a pretty effective way</p>
<p>at getting rid of weeds so you could get more crop per acre,</p>
<p>more yield per acre.</p>
<p>A long time, people thought that Roundup,</p>
<p>like many of the traditional persistent chemical herbicides</p>
<p>was carcinogenic and people were concerned about that.</p>
<p>And as a result, there was a lot of studying done.</p>
<p>In fact, before I sold my company to Monsanto,</p>
<p>I spent a lot of time researching Roundup and glyphosate</p>
<p>to make sure that it was safe,</p>
<p>that I wasn&rsquo;t selling my company</p>
<p>to what everyone was saying was the devil at the time.</p>
<p>And from a scientific basis,</p>
<p>I felt pretty comfortable about the data,</p>
<p>the studies, the research that had been done.</p>
<p>When I was at Monsanto,</p>
<p>there was a bit of a political event that took place</p>
<p>at the World Health Organization.</p>
<p>The World Health Organization runs a group called IARC.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a cancer research institute that&rsquo;s part of the WHO.</p>
<p>And there was a gentleman who was politically trying</p>
<p>to get himself on that council</p>
<p>to make the case that glyphosate was carcinogenic.</p>
<p>And years later, a Reuters reporter identified</p>
<p>how he was able to get this council</p>
<p>to disregard a number of scientific findings and studies,</p>
<p>including the US EPA and other very wide,</p>
<p>broad ranging studies by international organizations</p>
<p>showing that Roundup or glyphosate was non-carcinogenic.</p>
<p>But the political process by which he was able</p>
<p>to get on the council, get that data excluded from a study</p>
<p>and then get IARC to declare Roundup or glyphosate</p>
<p>a possible carcinogen or probable carcinogen,</p>
<p>then triggered a bunch of tort lawyers in the United States</p>
<p>to start suing Monsanto and now Bayer,</p>
<p>because Bayer bought Monsanto a number of years ago,</p>
<p>for causing cancer.</p>
<p>And the data is absent,</p>
<p>but the way the US court system works</p>
<p>is if you have some probable definition</p>
<p>and you can get a jury to say yes,</p>
<p>and the probable cause was there&rsquo;s a probable carcinogen</p>
<p>label applied to it by IARC.</p>
<p>And this Reuters reporter years ago did a great job</p>
<p>highlighting how this whole thing</p>
<p>was kind of politically motivated</p>
<p>and the data and the science</p>
<p>from a broad range of scientists,</p>
<p>including the AAAS,</p>
<p>a lot of scientific membership organizations</p>
<p>very definitively and clearly show</p>
<p>that glyphosate is non-carcinogenic.</p>
<p>But it was super troubling and frustrating.</p>
<p>Now, look, this doesn&rsquo;t bother me personally anymore.</p>
<p>I have no interest whatsoever,</p>
<p>but it turns out that these lawsuits</p>
<p>are now gonna cost Monsanto and now Bayer,</p>
<p>which bought Monsanto,</p>
<p>somewhere between 10 and $15 billion to settle this.</p>
<p>And this is all a function of some political hacking</p>
<p>that took place at the WHO.</p>
<p>So for a long time,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had a bit of a concern about how the WHO operates</p>
<p>and the process by which they do scientific assessment</p>
<p>and validation.</p>
<p>And a lot of this has obviously become much more apparent</p>
<p>with the coronavirus crisis</p>
<p>and the response with respect to masks</p>
<p>and treatment and so on.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a little bit of the background</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re referring to, Chamath.</p>
<p>And so, go ahead, Chamath, if you want to.</p>
<p>No, I mean, to me,</p>
<p>I think that this is such an interesting thing.</p>
<p>I wanted to use it as this on-ramp to the WHO</p>
<p>largely because it&rsquo;s like the ineptitude</p>
<p>keeps compounding in that organization.</p>
<p>I just read that we still don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>a definitive posture on masks from the WHO</p>
<p>and that they are finally ceding ground</p>
<p>to the idea that the coronavirus</p>
<p>could partially be spread in air.</p>
<p>I mean, this is so bizarre because-</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the middle of July.</p>
<p>There are 3 million cases</p>
<p>and half a million people who have died</p>
<p>and we are still there.</p>
<p>And so, when I saw that Trump pulled out of the WHO,</p>
<p>in this weird way,</p>
<p>the way he did it was kind of cartoonish and stupid</p>
<p>and kind of an insolent child.</p>
<p>But the reason he did it was actually pretty reasonable</p>
<p>because this organization</p>
<p>is not a scientific or health body,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an academic body.</p>
<p>And you can see this in universities</p>
<p>where all of a sudden things tilt away from facts</p>
<p>and it tilts towards all kinds of very, very, very small</p>
<p>points of sort of like political capital</p>
<p>that people fight over.</p>
<p>And so, these politicized organizations are incredible.</p>
<p>And to the point at which we saw this past week,</p>
<p>the report that well over 250 of their own scientists</p>
<p>who they rely on said,</p>
<p>hey, it&rsquo;s very clear that this is an airborne phenomenon.</p>
<p>Aerosol, tiny microparticles of aerosol,</p>
<p>when people talk, when they sing,</p>
<p>when they cough, when they sneeze,</p>
<p>all this obvious stuff floats in the air.</p>
<p>And if you have a closed air conditioned location,</p>
<p>like say a church in the South or a hotel or a casino,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not a good idea to be in there.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s especially a bad idea to take your mask off.</p>
<p>So now the WHO is 0 for 2.</p>
<p>And Trump, as you said in his just horrifically comical way,</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t explain as we&rsquo;re very clearly explaining</p>
<p>that this is a political organization</p>
<p>that is funded by a duopoly of superpowers</p>
<p>that have many issues which we&rsquo;re gonna get into today.</p>
<p>And we don&rsquo;t have to say who the duopoly is.</p>
<p>Sax, when you look at this,</p>
<p>being our token conservative here,</p>
<p>and you see the Trump win,</p>
<p>how frustrating is it for you that Trump&rsquo;s delivery</p>
<p>and his persona, when he is right,</p>
<p>and a person can&rsquo;t be wrong all the time,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m proof positive of that,</p>
<p>you have to deal with the fact that he does it</p>
<p>in such a stupid, inane way</p>
<p>that you don&rsquo;t actually get credit for the win.</p>
<p>Well, Trump is often the bull in the China shop</p>
<p>and kind of disrupts the status quo</p>
<p>by throwing a grenade into it.</p>
<p>But frequently there are good reasons</p>
<p>why the status quo needs to be disrupted.</p>
<p>And the New York Times laid out the case in a news story</p>
<p>on who the one that reported the scientist complaining</p>
<p>that you were talking about.</p>
<p>It was just a straight news story,</p>
<p>but it almost came across as an expose</p>
<p>because who&rsquo;s incompetence was laid out so starkly.</p>
<p>The fact that they were slow on mass and opposed them</p>
<p>and I think kind of lied about them.</p>
<p>And then to be downplaying the airborne nature of the virus</p>
<p>in favor of maintaining this narrative</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s spread through touching surfaces or fomites,</p>
<p>which I think people are realizing now</p>
<p>is much, much less likely.</p>
<p>And so, yeah, you do kind of have to wonder</p>
<p>whose side is who on.</p>
<p>And the New York Times article kind of suggests</p>
<p>why they do this, which is when they issue a declaration,</p>
<p>they have to think about the ramifications</p>
<p>in all of their member countries.</p>
<p>And so what ends up happening is they sort of start</p>
<p>with the policy implication or political result</p>
<p>that they are thinking about</p>
<p>and then they kind of reverse engineer the science.</p>
<p>And the article talks about how if who were to come out</p>
<p>and sort of be very clear about airborne transmission</p>
<p>that could affect spending or political budgets</p>
<p>in all of these different countries.</p>
<p>And so they&rsquo;ve been reluctant to do that.</p>
<p>So yeah, it&rsquo;s a organization that&rsquo;s sort of political first</p>
<p>and then reverse engineers the science to fit that.</p>
<p>And-</p>
<p>You know what this reminds me of?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like when you have giant investors</p>
<p>on the board of a company,</p>
<p>the management team comes out</p>
<p>and now they&rsquo;ve got to present like a pivot</p>
<p>or an acquisition or whatever it is.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re thinking, well, okay,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve got this funding source.</p>
<p>These people own 26% of who, this person owns 22%.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve now got to present it to them.</p>
<p>And what are the downstream ramifications?</p>
<p>Luckily, there&rsquo;s an alignment in a single company.</p>
<p>The alignment is we all want the company share price</p>
<p>to go up.</p>
<p>But here in the world, it is not equally aligned.</p>
<p>What is in China&rsquo;s best interest,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s in the EU&rsquo;s best interest</p>
<p>and what&rsquo;s in America&rsquo;s best interest</p>
<p>might be radically different.</p>
<p>And they are literally funding them, correct, Srimath?</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s a thing called Sayer&rsquo;s Law, right?</p>
<p>Which many of us kind of have seen play out,</p>
<p>which is that academic,</p>
<p>the saying is something like academic politics</p>
<p>are so vicious because the stakes are so small.</p>
<p>And in this interesting way,</p>
<p>the WHO has lost the script</p>
<p>because they fight over politics.</p>
<p>Who gets to say what, who&rsquo;s being positioned</p>
<p>and they lose sight of the real downstream,</p>
<p>in my opinion,</p>
<p>the downstream implications of the things that they have.</p>
<p>Because if they actually just thought from first principles</p>
<p>and tried to be a truly independent body</p>
<p>that said we are gonna take the capital we&rsquo;re given</p>
<p>from the countries that are supporting us</p>
<p>and actually do the best</p>
<p>and actually publish like what is the best thing to do.</p>
<p>For example, in the case of coronavirus</p>
<p>and be definitive and iterate,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;d be in a much better place.</p>
<p>But a lot of what has allowed the posture around coronavirus</p>
<p>to transition from a health issue to a political issue</p>
<p>in many ways has been because organizations like the WHO</p>
<p>and the CDC are political bodies and they&rsquo;re academic bodies.</p>
<p>And so the incentives of the players</p>
<p>within these organizations are not to necessarily</p>
<p>project the right public health positioning.</p>
<p>They are at some level to think</p>
<p>about their own career trajectory</p>
<p>and the political machinations that happen</p>
<p>within the organization that are blind</p>
<p>to normal citizens like us that just consume the output.</p>
<p>And then so when you see something</p>
<p>like an inability to give a definitive ruling</p>
<p>on things like masks or other things,</p>
<p>you just kind of scratch your head and wonder,</p>
<p>is it that they&rsquo;re dumb?</p>
<p>And the answer is no, it&rsquo;s not that they&rsquo;re dumb.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just motivated by very different things</p>
<p>than public health all the time.</p>
<p>Which might be including keeping their jobs.</p>
<p>And the fact that we had David Friedberg on this podcast</p>
<p>and then Sachs chiming in after it, shortly after,</p>
<p>just definitively saying first principles,</p>
<p>why wouldn&rsquo;t you wear a mask?</p>
<p>What is the possible downside?</p>
<p>And Friedberg saying,</p>
<p>hey, I&rsquo;m getting some testing equipment.</p>
<p>We should just be doing mass testing.</p>
<p>Friedberg, when you look at this</p>
<p>and how when we started the podcast,</p>
<p>I think in March or April, we were very clear</p>
<p>as people not in the, with the exception of yourself,</p>
<p>not in the healthcare space in any way,</p>
<p>what would be a better structure for the who?</p>
<p>Or is there a better structure</p>
<p>than just a bunch of randos like us on a podcast,</p>
<p>very easily seeing through first principles</p>
<p>that a 79 cent mask is a no brainer,</p>
<p>that getting testing, mass testing</p>
<p>and recording it every day and doing sampling,</p>
<p>what is the better solution here for governance</p>
<p>or for dealing with these type of really large problems</p>
<p>and ones that kind of have a clock.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the other thing about this problem is</p>
<p>this problem came with a countdown clock.</p>
<p>You had to make a really fast decision</p>
<p>in order to protect yourself.</p>
<p>And we made a really drawn out decision.</p>
<p>Now we&rsquo;re paying the price.</p>
<p>I mean, I think under the circumstances you outlined,</p>
<p>you need leadership, right?</p>
<p>So you need probably a country</p>
<p>or some entity to step forward</p>
<p>and lead with respect to being proactive</p>
<p>and aggressive with action</p>
<p>because any multinational oversight body</p>
<p>or political body is gonna be kind of molasses out.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna be stalled out with the processes</p>
<p>and the competing interests as you guys have highlighted.</p>
<p>So the libertarian argument would be</p>
<p>let the free market drive outcomes.</p>
<p>And some folks will succeed and some folks will fail.</p>
<p>If we want all of humanity to succeed,</p>
<p>then the likely scenario is what we&rsquo;ve seen</p>
<p>with world wars and such, which is you need leadership.</p>
<p>You need one organization or one entity</p>
<p>or one national body to step forward</p>
<p>and say, this is what we&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re gonna lead.</p>
<p>And the world was absent leadership</p>
<p>over the last six months.</p>
<p>Historically, the US has filled that void,</p>
<p>but that certainly wasn&rsquo;t the case this year.</p>
<p>And so it seems to me like you&rsquo;re not gonna find</p>
<p>a political governing system,</p>
<p>multinational governing system</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s gonna be successful in solving</p>
<p>these kind of existential global problems overnight.</p>
<p>You really need someone to step forward.</p>
<p>And the US is kind of leaving a bit of a gap.</p>
<p>This might be a good segue because the question next</p>
<p>is who&rsquo;s gonna fill that gap going forward.</p>
<p>Yeah, so let&rsquo;s make that segue.</p>
<p>When you look at the duopoly that currently is,</p>
<p>I would say on par now,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think we can say we&rsquo;re the superpower anymore</p>
<p>and that China&rsquo;s an up and coming superpower.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty clear they are an equal superpower.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if anybody here disagrees with that right now,</p>
<p>but if we have an edge,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a very minor one at this point.</p>
<p>How do we look at health problems</p>
<p>with an authoritarian country</p>
<p>where individuals do not vote?</p>
<p>And there is a God King who has recently said,</p>
<p>I will be the God King for the rest of my life for sure.</p>
<p>How do we manage this relationship with China?</p>
<p>Friedberg.</p>
<p>And then we can pass it over to Sachs.</p>
<p>From a healthcare perspective?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start there for sure.</p>
<p>And then whatever other major issue</p>
<p>you would like to then segue into,</p>
<p>climate change comes to mind, trade comes to mind,</p>
<p>human rights comes to mind.</p>
<p>I would imagine the biggest,</p>
<p>the argument that your geopolitical commentators would make</p>
<p>who are probably more experienced and experts in this</p>
<p>than any of us would probably relate</p>
<p>to the degree of influence.</p>
<p>The question of who has the most influence globally</p>
<p>may be kind of the way that you define</p>
<p>who has the most power globally.</p>
<p>And so, in the current circumstance,</p>
<p>you can look at trade balance</p>
<p>between China and other nations.</p>
<p>You can look at trade balance</p>
<p>between the US and other nations,</p>
<p>and you can look at the balance sheet,</p>
<p>the assets and the debt owed.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>I mean, a lot of people are making the case</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re kind of reaching a point of parity</p>
<p>through some metric or some set of equations here.</p>
<p>And at this point, there&rsquo;s gonna be a jockeying</p>
<p>for leadership globally in terms of influence.</p>
<p>And so, that will have ramifications</p>
<p>with respect to things that are global in nature,</p>
<p>like global pandemics.</p>
<p>And I think this is a really kind of key flash moment,</p>
<p>a flashpoint moment for us,</p>
<p>because we are facing that,</p>
<p>we did face that circumstance this year,</p>
<p>and obviously we took the raw end of the deal.</p>
<p>We failed most.</p>
<p>I mean, we all concur on that.</p>
<p>We did worst.</p>
<p>China is just like an extremely good example</p>
<p>of focusing on strategy</p>
<p>while the rest of us focused on tactics.</p>
<p>The last 20 years have been punctuated</p>
<p>by the United States spending literally</p>
<p>trillions of dollars on endless wars</p>
<p>and unnecessary military infrastructure</p>
<p>and all kinds of wasted pork barrel spending</p>
<p>and programs that just have resulted in zero ROI</p>
<p>for the United States and its taxpayers and citizens.</p>
<p>And instead, what did China do?</p>
<p>They basically went around the world</p>
<p>and they used the equivalent amount of dollars.</p>
<p>And they said, every war that the United States fights</p>
<p>is a war that we can essentially be silent on.</p>
<p>Let them do that dirty work.</p>
<p>And what we will do instead is we will go</p>
<p>and basically buy and own large swaths of Southeast Asia,</p>
<p>large swaths of Africa,</p>
<p>which is the emerging labor pools</p>
<p>that will drive GDP forward for us.</p>
<p>And what they&rsquo;ve essentially created</p>
<p>is not necessarily a voting block,</p>
<p>but a productivity block.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s so interesting</p>
<p>and also really important to understand,</p>
<p>which is that China is fighting not an ideological war.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re fighting an economic war.</p>
<p>And it is one where they are buying</p>
<p>member states to join them with their capital.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;ve kind of like not seen it</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s unfortunately happened right under our nose.</p>
<p>So now what we need to do is we need to sort of wake up</p>
<p>to this reality and have a very aggressive point of view</p>
<p>around what matters.</p>
<p>So by the way, this is also why,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll hand the mic to David after this,</p>
<p>but this is also why I think like</p>
<p>we have completely wasted so much time</p>
<p>focusing on all these other countries</p>
<p>that just don&rsquo;t matter anymore.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t say that emotionally.</p>
<p>I just say it practically,</p>
<p>like every single minute we spend on Russia</p>
<p>is just a wasted time.</p>
<p>This is a country that just won&rsquo;t fundamentally matter</p>
<p>in the world over the next 15 to 20 years.</p>
<p>Large swaths of Europe, they&rsquo;re ideologically aligned,</p>
<p>but they just don&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>The United States has to develop</p>
<p>a really specific strategic viewpoint</p>
<p>on the fact that it is us versus China,</p>
<p>whether we like it or not.</p>
<p>And it starts in things like public policy,</p>
<p>but it stretches to everything,</p>
<p>including capitalism, technology,</p>
<p>intellectual property, healthcare.</p>
<p>And this war will not be fought on the ground with guns.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll be fought with computers</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;ll be fought with money.</p>
<p>And I think we need to realize that.</p>
<p>Loans and joint ventures.</p>
<p>Sax, what are your thoughts here on this coming Cold War?</p>
<p>We beat the Russians in the last Cold War.</p>
<p>And to Chamath&rsquo;s point,</p>
<p>the only thing they have really going for them</p>
<p>is their incredibly sinister KGB style information warfare</p>
<p>and the decreasing value of their oil and irrelevance,</p>
<p>which is why they have to do things</p>
<p>like mess with us on social media.</p>
<p>I mean, literally I feel like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like the last couple of dying techniques</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve got in their playbook from the 80s as the KGB.</p>
<p>And they got a KGB agent running the country.</p>
<p>When we look at China,</p>
<p>how do you frame our relationship with them</p>
<p>and what would be the best practice</p>
<p>for the next 10 years?</p>
<p>Midterm, in other words.</p>
<p>I think what you&rsquo;ve seen just really</p>
<p>in the last couple of weeks</p>
<p>is a critical mass of scholarship and punditry</p>
<p>declaring that we are in a new Cold War with China.</p>
<p>And I think of all the momentous news events</p>
<p>that have happened this year,</p>
<p>from COVID to the riots and protests,</p>
<p>I think that the most newsworthy</p>
<p>and historically important event</p>
<p>will be the beginning of this</p>
<p>and the recognition that we are now in Cold War II.</p>
<p>So TikTok.</p>
<p>TikTok is part of it.</p>
<p>I mean, COVID.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s paradoxical that a dance app</p>
<p>is literally the tip of the spear.</p>
<p>I mean, I think TikTok is sort of at the fringes.</p>
<p>I think the Cold War II, to David&rsquo;s point,</p>
<p>started when the United States basically embargoed Huawei</p>
<p>from getting access to 5G technology.</p>
<p>And I know that sounds like a very sort of like</p>
<p>thin thread that most people don&rsquo;t understand</p>
<p>and we can unpack it in a second.</p>
<p>But in my opinion, that sort of,</p>
<p>at the beginning of this year</p>
<p>was when I started to pay attention</p>
<p>and try to understand this issue more</p>
<p>because it seemed like, wow,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a shot across the bow</p>
<p>and declaring China as the clear,</p>
<p>sort of the clear and present danger</p>
<p>for American sovereignty.</p>
<p>And the NBA and TikTok</p>
<p>being cultural ramifications of that,</p>
<p>which are different.</p>
<p>TikTok&rsquo;s irrelevant.</p>
<p>Who cares?</p>
<p>Is it irrelevant, Sax?</p>
<p>Well, what TikTok and Huawei have in common</p>
<p>is that the sort of proxy battles of Cold War II</p>
<p>will be fought between these sort of client corporations.</p>
<p>Whereas, you know, Cold War I,</p>
<p>you had sort of these proxy,</p>
<p>these sort of client states fighting these proxy wars.</p>
<p>Cold War II,</p>
<p>you have more of these like client corporations</p>
<p>fighting these proxy wars.</p>
<p>So, you know, it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the sense in which I think they&rsquo;re related.</p>
<p>The, what TikTok shows is a company</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s desperately trying to maneuver</p>
<p>so they don&rsquo;t become one of the first economic casualties</p>
<p>of Cold War II.</p>
<p>They appointed a American as CEO.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve pulled out of Hong Kong</p>
<p>so they&rsquo;re not subject to those regulations.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re desperately maneuvering</p>
<p>so they don&rsquo;t get banned in the United States.</p>
<p>They want to preserve their market access.</p>
<p>But I think there&rsquo;s a very good chance</p>
<p>that they will get shut down in the US.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve been shut down in India.</p>
<p>And today is July the 10th.</p>
<p>And right before we went on,</p>
<p>the breaking news was that Amazon basically asked</p>
<p>all their employees to delete TikTok</p>
<p>because of a security threat.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>I think that TikTok,</p>
<p>unless they basically have ByteDance</p>
<p>sell under 20 or 30% of the company</p>
<p>and get it into the hands of Americans,</p>
<p>it will get banned.</p>
<p>And I think that there will be a massive destruction</p>
<p>in enterprise value.</p>
<p>But can I tell you why TikTok doesn&rsquo;t matter</p>
<p>or doesn&rsquo;t matter as much?</p>
<p>I think, David, you&rsquo;re right,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s sort of like collateral damage.</p>
<p>It almost is like, you know, it&rsquo;ll exist, but whatever.</p>
<p>The Huawei thing, in my opinion, is so important</p>
<p>because it shines a light on two things.</p>
<p>The first is that, you know,</p>
<p>what happened essentially is the United States told TSMC,</p>
<p>you know, you cannot basically give Huawei access</p>
<p>to the 5G chipsets and the 5G technology</p>
<p>that they would use to essentially kind of like,</p>
<p>you know, implement their spyware</p>
<p>and then sell it into Western nations, effectively.</p>
<p>And so then what it does is it puts China</p>
<p>in the posture of having to figure out</p>
<p>how do they get access to this stuff?</p>
<p>And, you know, the most obvious answer is to invade Taiwan</p>
<p>and take over TSMC.</p>
<p>And, you know, why would they do that?</p>
<p>Well, obviously that has huge geopolitical ramifications,</p>
<p>but they could only do that, again,</p>
<p>going back to the first comment,</p>
<p>is because they&rsquo;ve already bought so many nation states</p>
<p>into their productivity block</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s still on a balance, a worthwhile trade.</p>
<p>And it allows them to solve their version</p>
<p>of Taiwanese sovereignty completely and definitively</p>
<p>and basically say, look, we&rsquo;ve now solved Hong Kong.</p>
<p>You know, Macau was already solved</p>
<p>and now we&rsquo;re gonna solve Taiwan</p>
<p>and put the whole thing to bed</p>
<p>and now we have access to this critical technology</p>
<p>that we need.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why I think sort of like what happens with Huawei,</p>
<p>sort of what happens with TSMC,</p>
<p>what happens on 5G is so important</p>
<p>because if you&rsquo;re going to force China, you know,</p>
<p>to basically have to buy Western technology</p>
<p>in order to get access to a critical piece of,</p>
<p>you know, internet infrastructure,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna be put to a very, very difficult test</p>
<p>about what they have to do.</p>
<p>And then they will have to be much more transparent</p>
<p>on the global stage about what their ambitions really are</p>
<p>and how far they&rsquo;re willing to go.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s, you know,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a lot more important than, you know,</p>
<p>a bunch of kids dancing to short videos.</p>
<p>Well, and just to add to that point, you know,</p>
<p>so I think Jamal is right that these sort of chips,</p>
<p>the 5G chips and these other chips,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re the new oil, you know,</p>
<p>in terms of their geopolitical significance.</p>
<p>You know, obviously all of our technology,</p>
<p>our iPhones, our advanced weaponry,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all based on these chips</p>
<p>and 70% of them are fabricated in Taiwan.</p>
<p>And I think, you know,</p>
<p>one of the huge blind spots of American trade policy</p>
<p>over the last 30 years is kind of not to notice</p>
<p>that this key technology,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really the substrate for all of our technology,</p>
<p>for our economy, has now been,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s now been moved and it&rsquo;s manufactured, you know,</p>
<p>in Taiwan whose sovereignty China does not recognize</p>
<p>and is constantly, you know,</p>
<p>threatening with the risk of being annexed.</p>
<p>So, you know, we have a tremendous vulnerability there.</p>
<p>And, you know, at the same, you know,</p>
<p>we finally, after about 40 or 50 years of declaring</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;d be energy independent, we&rsquo;ve achieved that,</p>
<p>but now we have this new dependency on these chips that-</p>
<p>And pharma and manufacturing.</p>
<p>I mean, and we, it seems like now manufacturing,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re starting to realize, hey, Elon was right.</p>
<p>We need to be able to build our own factories.</p>
<p>And guess what?</p>
<p>American spirit, American ingenuity,</p>
<p>American focus, American capitalism, we can do it.</p>
<p>We have the wherewithal to do it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no reason we cannot make these chips here.</p>
<p>Sorry, I don&rsquo;t buy it</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re going to be this dependent forever.</p>
<p>We just need to have the will and the leadership to say,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to do this,</p>
<p>whether it costs us an extra 50 cents per chip.</p>
<p>And-</p>
<p>Well, the fabrication of these chips</p>
<p>is incredibly complicated.</p>
<p>I mean, they&rsquo;re basically-</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s buy the companies.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re microscopic.</p>
<p>And it takes years, like several years,</p>
<p>to set up the facility to do this kind of fabrication.</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t we buy those companies now?</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t we just take, to Chamath&rsquo;s point,</p>
<p>which was very clear, which is, hey, this is an economic,</p>
<p>this is a ledger,</p>
<p>this is a check writing exercise to win this war.</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t we take out our checkbook</p>
<p>and buy 50% of these companies now</p>
<p>and put them on the NASDAQ if they&rsquo;re not already there?</p>
<p>It requires real leadership.</p>
<p>At the end of the day,</p>
<p>it needs to be led by the United States government.</p>
<p>The reality is that lithography has gotten so advanced.</p>
<p>I mean, like, look, I have companies</p>
<p>that are taping out chips at like seven nanometer,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t have supplier diversity.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t basically choose nine folks to bid it out against,</p>
<p>of which five are domestically in the United States.</p>
<p>There are two, right?</p>
<p>And so you kind of just deal with the complexity</p>
<p>or the lack of diversity that we have.</p>
<p>And Jason, your point is exactly right,</p>
<p>which is the first and most important decision here</p>
<p>is one that&rsquo;s philosophical,</p>
<p>which is again saying that era of efficiency</p>
<p>at the sake of all else is over.</p>
<p>And we are now moving to an era of resilience,</p>
<p>which inherently is more inefficient.</p>
<p>But in that inefficiency,</p>
<p>we will rebuild American prosperity</p>
<p>because it rebuilds American industry</p>
<p>and it rebuilds American jobs.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s another example</p>
<p>that I want to build on David&rsquo;s point,</p>
<p>which is let&rsquo;s all believe and attest</p>
<p>that we all care about climate change for a second,</p>
<p>and we all want the world to be electrified, okay?</p>
<p>Well, electricity and electrification</p>
<p>requires two very, very basic inputs, okay?</p>
<p>One is a battery,</p>
<p>and the second is an electric motor, right?</p>
<p>Make sense so far?</p>
<p>Well, inside an electric motor,</p>
<p>there is one critical thing that you need to make it work,</p>
<p>which is a permanent magnet.</p>
<p>The permanent magnet spins around</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s how an electric motor works.</p>
<p>Okay, why is that important?</p>
<p>As it turns out that permanent magnets</p>
<p>need special characteristics</p>
<p>that are only provided by a handful</p>
<p>of very, very specific rare earth materials</p>
<p>that we need to mine out of the ground and refine.</p>
<p>Those materials actually exist in many places,</p>
<p>including the United States.</p>
<p>Yeah, we stopped mining for them.</p>
<p>But right now,</p>
<p>China controls 80% of the supply of rare earths.</p>
<p>They can choose how they price it.</p>
<p>They can differentially price to their own companies,</p>
<p>which means that the battery</p>
<p>and engine manufacturers inside of China</p>
<p>can now lead on electrification,</p>
<p>which means China can actually lead on climate change</p>
<p>before the United States can,</p>
<p>unless we have leadership that says,</p>
<p>at a governmental level on down,</p>
<p>we are gonna make this a priority.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna fund it.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna make sure that there are onshore mines.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna make sure that those mines are clean.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna build a supply chain domestically</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re gonna subsidize.</p>
<p>This is what governments do best.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not act, it&rsquo;s just incentivize on things like climate.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>Friedberg has spent a lot of time on climate change.</p>
<p>So he has probably a lot of ideas on this,</p>
<p>but whenever you look at any of these things,</p>
<p>health, climate, food,</p>
<p>it all comes down to the United States versus China,</p>
<p>strategy versus tactics.</p>
<p>Friedberg?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure.</p>
<p>I think that the Chinese action</p>
<p>is as deterministic as we think it is,</p>
<p>or as we kind of frame it,</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s China&rsquo;s got this grand plan.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re gonna beat the US</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re gonna control things</p>
<p>and make decisions that hurt us.</p>
<p>I think a lot of this is,</p>
<p>China, if you think about it,</p>
<p>less about black and white,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a continuum.</p>
<p>And the continuum is one of influence</p>
<p>and one of creating an environment</p>
<p>whereby these things can happen.</p>
<p>So China, for example,</p>
<p>made capital readily available</p>
<p>for the agriculture industry</p>
<p>to be able to buy assets.</p>
<p>And so the companies inside of China,</p>
<p>which aren&rsquo;t controlled,</p>
<p>the Chinese government isn&rsquo;t telling them what to do.</p>
<p>The Chinese government has set a policy</p>
<p>that enables them to increase their prosperity</p>
<p>and as a result,</p>
<p>increase the prosperity of the Chinese people.</p>
<p>When I was at Monsanto,</p>
<p>we bid for the largest ag chemicals company</p>
<p>in the world based out of Switzerland.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called Syngenta.</p>
<p>And we bid like $44 billion to buy this company.</p>
<p>And the largest chemical company in China</p>
<p>called ChemChina bid $47 billion</p>
<p>and acquired the business.</p>
<p>And they now own the largest</p>
<p>ag chemicals company in the world.</p>
<p>China also bought Smithfields</p>
<p>and they put a bunch of people in Canada.</p>
<p>Hey, Friedberg,</p>
<p>how much of that money do you think came from the CCP?</p>
<p>And what involvement do you think the CCP had</p>
<p>in putting their thumb on the scale</p>
<p>of making sure that transaction went that direction?</p>
<p>Look, I mean, ultimately,</p>
<p>wherever the capital comes from,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s no less equivalent</p>
<p>than what you would see in the United States</p>
<p>where treasuries fund the central bank,</p>
<p>which funds banks,</p>
<p>which fund lending to corporations,</p>
<p>which ultimately make purchases.</p>
<p>But do you think the leadership said,</p>
<p>hey, we&rsquo;re winning this at all costs?</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s what happened.</p>
<p>In 2007, there was a CCP internal doctrine</p>
<p>that was published and it&rsquo;s now reasonably well-known.</p>
<p>And there was a speech that was given</p>
<p>that started this aggressive action in agriculture.</p>
<p>And as a result,</p>
<p>Chinese citizens started moving to Canada</p>
<p>and buying farmland in Canada.</p>
<p>They started moving to Australia,</p>
<p>buying farmland in China.</p>
<p>They started building these facilities</p>
<p>in Argentina and Brazil and Africa.</p>
<p>And the Chinese government set out a strategic objective</p>
<p>and provided the capital</p>
<p>and enabled industry and people</p>
<p>to go after pursuing these interests.</p>
<p>But the CCP didn&rsquo;t say, here&rsquo;s the roadmap.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like, here&rsquo;s the specific plan</p>
<p>for what we need to do.</p>
<p>They had a general high level kind of point of view</p>
<p>that I think drove all that action</p>
<p>and all of that behavior.</p>
<p>And so, I would say it&rsquo;s not as perhaps coercive</p>
<p>as we might think it is</p>
<p>in terms of the CCP wanting to target and attack US.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re trying to increase their influence</p>
<p>around the world.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re trying to increase their own security</p>
<p>and increase their own prosperity.</p>
<p>And at some point,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s only so many resources globally.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s only so much land, so much magnets</p>
<p>that they&hellip;</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re winning in the markets.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re kind of crossing that threshold now</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re actually like a competitor.</p>
<p>The only difference between this is,</p>
<p>and I couldn&rsquo;t disagree with-</p>
<p>Sorry, my point is,</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t wanna frame it as like,</p>
<p>I just think it&rsquo;s a misstatement to frame it</p>
<p>as China has this grand plan to come after the US</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re evil and that&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>I mean, they-</p>
<p>Yeah, see, this is where I think</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re completely wrong, David, respectfully.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I believe this is an ideological war.</p>
<p>And you can&rsquo;t diminish what&rsquo;s happening in Hollywood,</p>
<p>TikTok and the NBA and other sports</p>
<p>where China is explicitly saying,</p>
<p>if you put a villain in a movie,</p>
<p>if you talk about Tibet in a movie,</p>
<p>we are going to not play that movie.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re gonna start funding your movies.</p>
<p>And so they are absolutely using the vector of culture.</p>
<p>And Chamath, I think you&rsquo;re also wrong here</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re saying, oh, TikTok&rsquo;s not important.</p>
<p>TikTok is something that a generation of kids</p>
<p>absolutely are in love with.</p>
<p>And those kids are like, hey, boomers,</p>
<p>stay out of our platform.</p>
<p>And so, and the ideological issue here, Freebird,</p>
<p>which I think that you&rsquo;re underplaying is,</p>
<p>they want to win and they want to spread their ideology,</p>
<p>which is the ideology of authoritarianism.</p>
<p>They are not going to win Africa</p>
<p>and then suddenly say, you know what,</p>
<p>would be great for Africa</p>
<p>if we made the entire continent democracies.</p>
<p>Tell me that&rsquo;s not in their best interest.</p>
<p>How is it different than Trump tweeting?</p>
<p>Well, Freebird, I just think that it&rsquo;s inconceivable to me</p>
<p>that the Chinese, when they do this grandiose planning</p>
<p>and they do the political theater</p>
<p>of having the thousands of people in the Chinese</p>
<p>assembly hall once a year in Xi Jinping talks,</p>
<p>that they haven&rsquo;t developed a multifaceted,</p>
<p>multi-layered plan that they&rsquo;re executing.</p>
<p>In part, I think this is why Xi Jinping</p>
<p>essentially wants to be this ruler for life inside of China</p>
<p>because he, I think they have a 20 or 30 year plan.</p>
<p>And I do think it is to disrupt the United States.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think that they believe though,</p>
<p>which is the smart thing, that there&rsquo;s one silver bullet.</p>
<p>I just think that they&rsquo;re going to take a thousand shots</p>
<p>on goal, whether it&rsquo;s, you know,</p>
<p>monopolizing the rare earths or, you know,</p>
<p>figuring out how to basically put spying software</p>
<p>in the hands of millions of Americans.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where I think TikTok is actually really important.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s essentially a vehicle to spy</p>
<p>and backdoor into Americans.</p>
<p>Or whether it&rsquo;s, you know, introducing a digital Yuan</p>
<p>so that we can try to disrupt the, you know,</p>
<p>the use of the U.S. dollar</p>
<p>as a reserve currency of the world.</p>
<p>They probably have a list of a thousand tactics</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re going to go and execute them.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t begrudge them that.</p>
<p>I just think it&rsquo;s well-organized machine.</p>
<p>I just think we now need to counterpunch.</p>
<p>Sachs?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, so China is on a mission</p>
<p>of national greatness.</p>
<p>I think the immediate goal is to assert its hegemony</p>
<p>over Asia and to kick the U.S. out of that region.</p>
<p>But I think ultimately now they see in their sights</p>
<p>potentially being the number one country</p>
<p>in the entire world because of the chaos</p>
<p>that COVID has wrought over here.</p>
<p>And in fairness, David,</p>
<p>the incompetence of Trump thus far.</p>
<p>I mean, like, you know, it&rsquo;s not fair to think</p>
<p>that the Chinese Politburo versus Trump</p>
<p>and his cabinet are an equal match.</p>
<p>Forget their political persuasion.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, they clearly seem emboldened.</p>
<p>And, you know, just in the last few weeks and months,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve seen the ending of the two systems in Hong Kong,</p>
<p>which was a 50-year commitment they made in,</p>
<p>I think, 1984.</p>
<p>So they abrogated on that commitment.</p>
<p>Well, and Sachs, they happened to do that</p>
<p>three or four months before Trump is looking like</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s not gonna be in office.</p>
<p>So talking about shots on goal,</p>
<p>this may be their only shot to do this.</p>
<p>And does that mean they go after Taiwan?</p>
<p>Yeah, and do they go after Taiwan in the next 100 days</p>
<p>where they have a window?</p>
<p>I think we have to be extremely clear</p>
<p>that Taiwan is a red line for us</p>
<p>and that we&rsquo;re committed to the security of Taiwan.</p>
<p>Because if we show any hesitation or weakness there,</p>
<p>they will seize on that.</p>
<p>And-</p>
<p>Would Trump do that?</p>
<p>Would Trump put his foot down?</p>
<p>Because he did nothing when it came to supporting-</p>
<p>I think we need to abstract away</p>
<p>from any given president of the United States</p>
<p>because they change every four or eight years.</p>
<p>And I think we need to have a bigger discussion,</p>
<p>which is, like I said, over the next 40 to 50 years,</p>
<p>are we comfortable with duopoly power structure in the world,</p>
<p>which is the United States and China,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s effectively what we are today,</p>
<p>or are we the shining city on a hill once again?</p>
<p>And if so, what are we willing to do</p>
<p>to make sure that that&rsquo;s the case?</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s independent of your political persuasion</p>
<p>and your party.</p>
<p>Right, right.</p>
<p>Well, the good news here is that both Trump and Biden</p>
<p>are basically racing to sort of position themselves</p>
<p>as the more hawkish candidate on China,</p>
<p>which is to say that this recognition of Cold War II</p>
<p>is now, I think, bipartisan,</p>
<p>which if you want to sustain a policy in this country</p>
<p>over, say, 40 years, like we did</p>
<p>in containing the Soviet Union,</p>
<p>you have to have bipartisan support for that.</p>
<p>And so it does seem like, finally, as a country,</p>
<p>I think we are kind of getting our act together on China.</p>
<p>I mean, obviously, there will be disagreements</p>
<p>within that larger context,</p>
<p>but it seems like now people are waking up to the threat</p>
<p>that China represents to, you know,</p>
<p>to America being the number one country in the world.</p>
<p>And I think-</p>
<p>Yeah, by the way, I agree with Sax.</p>
<p>I mean, I think that&rsquo;s exactly what&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>and what will happen here.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;ll certainly, it&rsquo;ll be a big hill to climb.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just highlight, and I&rsquo;ll ask the question of Chamath,</p>
<p>you know, per his point earlier.</p>
<p>Let me ask you guys,</p>
<p>how many factories do you think exist in China?</p>
<p>Take a guess.</p>
<p>11 million.</p>
<p>2.8 million.</p>
<p>Now, how many do you think exist in the United States?</p>
<p>150,000.</p>
<p>Close, about 250,000.</p>
<p>And China has about 83 million factory workers,</p>
<p>and we have about 12.</p>
<p>So, you know, Chamath, if we do end up in Cold War II,</p>
<p>where, you know, we escalate the tension</p>
<p>and escalate the divide,</p>
<p>how do we end up, you know,</p>
<p>having, avoiding $2,000 or $3,000 iPhones?</p>
<p>How do we get all the televisions we want for 500 bucks?</p>
<p>How do we do that,</p>
<p>given that, you know,</p>
<p>to catch up with this production capacity</p>
<p>will end up costing many tens of trillions of dollars</p>
<p>of invested capital</p>
<p>which China has invested over decades?</p>
<p>Well, this is such a brilliant,</p>
<p>this is a fabulous question.</p>
<p>And I think I don&rsquo;t have the answer,</p>
<p>but here&rsquo;s the way that I think about the solution.</p>
<p>You know, the thing that we had before</p>
<p>was in my way, in many ways,</p>
<p>like this kind of like perverted sense of globalism.</p>
<p>And I think that we, you know,</p>
<p>we thought that globalism equals utopia.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not true.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually more like a chessboard,</p>
<p>which means you have, you know,</p>
<p>two different sets of colored pieces</p>
<p>competing against each other.</p>
<p>And each piece on the board in many ways is a country.</p>
<p>So, you know, we can look at that as a geographic skew</p>
<p>and say like, we need to really consolidate,</p>
<p>you know, North, Central and South America</p>
<p>as a block, as a productivity block.</p>
<p>And so, David, that&rsquo;s where we need to have</p>
<p>more trade within those areas</p>
<p>so that we can actually build up production capacity</p>
<p>in places that can absorb and produce low cost labor</p>
<p>or low cost items to compete with the China block.</p>
<p>That may be a solution.</p>
<p>That is an incredible point, Chamath,</p>
<p>which is why the rhetoric with Mexico,</p>
<p>which would love to have a deep relationship with us,</p>
<p>is so dumb.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking about factories.</p>
<p>They would love for us to put more factories on there.</p>
<p>And whatever countries,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s work our way down the peninsula.</p>
<p>Yeah, go down the peninsula.</p>
<p>Go to Honduras, go to El Salvador, go to Guatemala,</p>
<p>where the people are screaming for work,</p>
<p>which is why they&rsquo;re trying to enter the United States.</p>
<p>The best way is to not build a wall,</p>
<p>take all that money and fuel it into production</p>
<p>and manufacturing and warehouse capacity</p>
<p>in those places in which they are leaving</p>
<p>in the first place.</p>
<p>And if we thought like China, we would&hellip;</p>
<p>Go ahead, go ahead, Freeberg, sorry.</p>
<p>No, you can&rsquo;t successfully sustain a Cold War with China</p>
<p>without global partnership.</p>
<p>And I think, you know, this notion of nationalism</p>
<p>and isolationism in the United States</p>
<p>will not work in a world</p>
<p>where we are also trying to compete globally with China</p>
<p>and are raising the stakes in a global Cold War.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t have it both ways.</p>
<p>So, you know, either the current administration policy</p>
<p>needs to change.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to hear Sax&rsquo;s point of view on this.</p>
<p>Or, you know, or we need to have a change in administration</p>
<p>and actually, you know, re-engage on a global basis</p>
<p>with partner states.</p>
<p>Well, okay.</p>
<p>So I think the point about,</p>
<p>about, well, I think what some people on the right would say</p>
<p>is that being able to buy cheap goods at target</p>
<p>is not worth the hollowing out</p>
<p>of the American industrial base</p>
<p>that happened over the past 30 years</p>
<p>and that was a catastrophic mistake.</p>
<p>And, you know, this is what got Trump reelected</p>
<p>was shattering that blue wall in those Rust Belt states.</p>
<p>So I think we can kind of look back on that</p>
<p>and wonder whether that trade-off was really worth it.</p>
<p>But moving forward, I think the balance is gonna be</p>
<p>to realize that trade does create wealth.</p>
<p>You know, all wealth, in fact, comes from trade,</p>
<p>whether at the level of individuals or nations.</p>
<p>If it weren&rsquo;t for trade, all of us would be</p>
<p>subsistence farmers or something like that.</p>
<p>But we also have to realize</p>
<p>that trade creates interdependence</p>
<p>because I stopped making certain things</p>
<p>in order to buy them from you.</p>
<p>And so in order to engage in trade,</p>
<p>we have to trust each other.</p>
<p>I have to trust that you one day won&rsquo;t decide</p>
<p>that your ability to manufacture antibiotics is strategic</p>
<p>and you might deprive me of them</p>
<p>in order to facilitate some geopolitical interest.</p>
<p>And so I think what we&rsquo;re waking up to</p>
<p>with production of pharmaceuticals or N95 masks,</p>
<p>you know, PPE, and now chips is that</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve had this real blind spot with respect to trade.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve basically offshored so many of the elements</p>
<p>that are necessary for our national survival.</p>
<p>And I think those elements have to be brought back</p>
<p>so that America is safe and independent.</p>
<p>But with respect to, you know, so many other things,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s fine for us to get them through trade,</p>
<p>whether, you know, it could be apparel or toys</p>
<p>or so many other goods that, you know,</p>
<p>we do want cheap goods that are not formally strategic.</p>
<p>I wanna do a mental exercise.</p>
<p>We all, for our living, try to come up with 100x,</p>
<p>1,000x solutions, whether we&rsquo;re creating the companies</p>
<p>or betting on the companies.</p>
<p>I want everybody to just think for a second</p>
<p>of the United States as a startup company</p>
<p>and a 10x, 100x idea for how we can</p>
<p>not only maintain our position,</p>
<p>but maybe become the shining hill</p>
<p>where we actually lead the world</p>
<p>towards democracy, towards human rights.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna start with one that I just happened to,</p>
<p>it hit me while you all were talking,</p>
<p>which is why I love doing this podcast</p>
<p>because I get such inspiration listening to you guys,</p>
<p>you know, pass the ball around.</p>
<p>We haven&rsquo;t added a state to the United States</p>
<p>in a pretty damn long time.</p>
<p>What if we said to Puerto Rico,</p>
<p>what if we said to the Dominican Republic,</p>
<p>what if we said to Honduras,</p>
<p>I mean, and I don&rsquo;t wanna make this</p>
<p>into a exercise in colonialism,</p>
<p>but if we said, you know what, Puerto Rico,</p>
<p>how do you feel about being the 51st state?</p>
<p>Because we&rsquo;re already 80% of the way there.</p>
<p>And what if we said the United States is going to,</p>
<p>and this is just a crazy 100x idea,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna start taking countries</p>
<p>that maybe love democracy,</p>
<p>that would love to be part of the United States</p>
<p>and having a bridge towards becoming part of this block,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s how Puerto Rico is.</p>
<p>Jason, the United States can barely function as it is.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m giving you the freedom to say</p>
<p>this is a 100x exercise as a startup,</p>
<p>because if we put out crazy ideas like this,</p>
<p>maybe we can pull people towards thinking</p>
<p>like the chessboard of how to play 3D chess</p>
<p>or how to win the chessboard,</p>
<p>not just move the pawns back and forth.</p>
<p>Well, I think the first thing America has to do</p>
<p>is decide whether it wants to,</p>
<p>whether it still thinks that national greatness is important</p>
<p>and whether it wants to compete</p>
<p>to be the leading power in the world.</p>
<p>Because right now it seems like we&rsquo;re hopelessly divided</p>
<p>and our guns are literally drawn on each other.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ve got this all out assault going on on capitalism,</p>
<p>you have sort of cancel culture</p>
<p>and America just seems hopelessly divided.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know if Americans still think it&rsquo;s important</p>
<p>to be the number one power in the world.</p>
<p>All right, so what&rsquo;s your thought experiment</p>
<p>on how to make Americans realize this is important?</p>
<p>Or if anybody else wants to jump in here</p>
<p>with a 10x idea for America, go ahead, John.</p>
<p>I have an overlaying theory</p>
<p>that this is sort of kind of me spitballing,</p>
<p>so bear with me, but-</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s do it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s this concept called the Overton window, right?</p>
<p>Which is sort of like the minimally viable,</p>
<p>acceptable surface area of dialogue,</p>
<p>at which case it starts to sort of get extreme.</p>
<p>I would theorize, I would tell you</p>
<p>that the Overton window is the smallest it&rsquo;s ever been.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s basically nothing that you can talk about</p>
<p>that is relatively benign without it being politicized.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no gradation anymore.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very binary thing.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re either in the Overton window,</p>
<p>which, for example, would be like vegetables matter</p>
<p>or looking both ways across the street matters.</p>
<p>And outside the Overton window,</p>
<p>honestly, is Black Lives Matter, as an example.</p>
<p>And it gets politicized on both sides.</p>
<p>Masks, if a balaclava when you&rsquo;re skiing</p>
<p>because your face is cold is inside the Overton window.</p>
<p>That same balaclava when you go to the drug store</p>
<p>so that you can actually either prevent disease</p>
<p>one way or the other is outside the Overton window.</p>
<p>Making sure that police are there to protect you</p>
<p>in a time of need is now outside the Overton window</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s framed in the lens of police brutality.</p>
<p>So the Overton window has shrunk.</p>
<p>So we have very little surface area</p>
<p>where we can actually all agree</p>
<p>without getting into a fight, ideologically.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re trying to cancel each other.</p>
<p>I totally agree with that.</p>
<p>I mean, we have this sort of epidemic</p>
<p>of cancel culture going on.</p>
<p>And I guess, Jason, you recently experienced this.</p>
<p>Oh my Lord.</p>
<p>I mean, for the love of God, what happened, Jason?</p>
<p>Tell us what happened.</p>
<p>Listen, I look at Twitter as a place</p>
<p>to have vibrant discussions.</p>
<p>And 10 years ago, it was kind of where</p>
<p>the Overton window was most open.</p>
<p>You could have a discussion about anything.</p>
<p>And we had a discussion about my feeling</p>
<p>that as a former journalist,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re doing random acts of journalism here,</p>
<p>that I just thought the New York Times</p>
<p>was just way too biased,</p>
<p>and that they picked a side</p>
<p>in order for their business to survive.</p>
<p>And I actually believe that.</p>
<p>I believe they picked the side of Trump.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, the side of anti-Trump</p>
<p>in order to get subscriptions</p>
<p>because their advertising business</p>
<p>has been demolished by the duopoly of Facebook and Google.</p>
<p>This led to the circling of the wagons</p>
<p>of the journalists, which I was part of.</p>
<p>But listen, it&rsquo;s pretty easy to hate me.</p>
<p>I understand that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a loud mouth.</p>
<p>And so now I&rsquo;m getting piled on by the journalists.</p>
<p>And you were an early investor in Uber.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t forget that.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t leave that out.</p>
<p>The third or fourth, they tell me the third or fourth.</p>
<p>Anyway, so there&rsquo;s a journalist at said publication,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not gonna say her name</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t want any harassment of anybody.</p>
<p>Who said people are stupid for going back to work</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re idiots.</p>
<p>And I said, this is a very convenient thing</p>
<p>for a journalist who works behind a keyboard</p>
<p>who makes $100,000 a year to say</p>
<p>because those people are literally not gonna be able</p>
<p>to feed their kids if they don&rsquo;t go back to work.</p>
<p>And this led to her saying I was harassing and stalking her.</p>
<p>Then I was in Clubhouse, the new social network</p>
<p>where you talk and the same journalist was in the audience.</p>
<p>And I said to the people who were talking,</p>
<p>just be aware there is a journalist in the audience</p>
<p>because even though this is a private beta,</p>
<p>this could wind up being in the New York Times,</p>
<p>which it did.</p>
<p>Not that discussion,</p>
<p>but another one that was covertly taped.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know if it was covertly taped</p>
<p>by journalists or not,</p>
<p>but it did wind up in the press.</p>
<p>Anyway, this whole thing turns into a giant fight.</p>
<p>And-</p>
<p>Clubhouse sounds like some dark S&amp;M sex club in Berlin.</p>
<p>No, no, that&rsquo;s a-</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what I think is most entertaining about this.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s Clubhouse, H-O-A-U-S, house, Clubhouse.</p>
<p>Yeah, what I think is most entertaining about this</p>
<p>is that the New York Times journalist</p>
<p>was in this vicious battle with Bology,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s a Silicon Valley founder and personality.</p>
<p>And they were arguing.</p>
<p>And then Jason somehow comes running over</p>
<p>and starts involving himself in this feud.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like Bology gets fouled,</p>
<p>but Jason takes the flop, you know?</p>
<p>And all of a sudden, Jason&rsquo;s talking about</p>
<p>how he&rsquo;s getting doxed.</p>
<p>Bology&rsquo;s the guy who was called out in the New York Times,</p>
<p>but somehow Jason takes the flop.</p>
<p>But anyway, so here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s happened.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m only telling the story.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not trying to get victim points,</p>
<p>give a fuck about that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s July 4th.</p>
<p>I put the kids down for the nap.</p>
<p>Steaks are going on the grill.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a fucking great day.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;m on the Peloton</p>
<p>trying to be just a little less fat</p>
<p>so I can be less fat than Sax</p>
<p>so that the photo that Sax is using,</p>
<p>I just come out 5% less fat than Sax.</p>
<p>And I look, and I had posted a picture of the tree line</p>
<p>outside my house of the beautiful blue sky on July 4th.</p>
<p>And I said, listen, everybody,</p>
<p>take a break from Twitter, go spend time with your family,</p>
<p>which is what I was about to do.</p>
<p>A 37-year-old private equity douche from Boston</p>
<p>does a reverse image search on the tree line,</p>
<p>finds a bigger picture of the trees,</p>
<p>finds a picture of my pool based on that bigger picture</p>
<p>in Google reverse image search and all these other tools,</p>
<p>and then doxes me,</p>
<p>which basically means releasing your address.</p>
<p>He releases my address in my thread,</p>
<p>okay, because, so I DM him,</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s using his real name,</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s got a LinkedIn profile.</p>
<p>And I said, do you realize how dangerous this is?</p>
<p>He goes, well, you&rsquo;re stalking said journalist.</p>
<p>I said, I am not stalking the journalist.</p>
<p>Well, she said you&rsquo;re stalking her.</p>
<p>So if you apologize to her</p>
<p>and you take down the mean stuff you said about her,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll take down your home address.</p>
<p>And I said, hey, dipshit, this is illegal, number one.</p>
<p>And number two, you&rsquo;re gonna lose your Twitter account.</p>
<p>And then I said, number three,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re connected, your boss,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re using your public name,</p>
<p>your boss is connected to 14 people,</p>
<p>of which like half are very close friends of mine.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m calling your boss,</p>
<p>and I have all these screenshots of you doxing me.</p>
<p>What do you think is gonna happen on Monday?</p>
<p>And I just gave him my phone number.</p>
<p>And hold on, hold on, go ahead.</p>
<p>You wanna finish the story?</p>
<p>Okay, sorry, go ahead.</p>
<p>Let me just finish the story.</p>
<p>I tell the guy, here&rsquo;s my phone number, he calls me.</p>
<p>I said, hey, I know that you&rsquo;re a kid.</p>
<p>I know that you did something rash,</p>
<p>but this is actually kind of a dangerous thing</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s serious mental illness in whatever,</p>
<p>0.1% of the population.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s millions of people</p>
<p>now involved in this discussion.</p>
<p>It could be a security concern for me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not gonna post your address.</p>
<p>Please don&rsquo;t post mine.</p>
<p>Delete the tweet.</p>
<p>He goes, I refuse to delete the tweet until you whatever.</p>
<p>And I said, okay, well, I&rsquo;m gonna call your boss on Monday.</p>
<p>We know these people in common.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s going to fire you and you&rsquo;re gonna lose your job.</p>
<p>Now, I know you&rsquo;re only 23 or 24,</p>
<p>and this doesn&rsquo;t matter to you.</p>
<p>And he goes, I said, how old are you?</p>
<p>He said, 37.</p>
<p>I said, you&rsquo;re 37 years old?</p>
<p>He said, are you married?</p>
<p>He said, yeah, I&rsquo;m married.</p>
<p>I got a six-year-old.</p>
<p>I said, now you want me to make you lose your job</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re so mad at me over nothing?</p>
<p>I said, I don&rsquo;t wanna call your boss on Monday</p>
<p>and tell them what you did</p>
<p>because it will certainly result in you being fired.</p>
<p>And he goes, oh, I said,</p>
<p>you might wanna go talk to your spouse about what you did</p>
<p>and maybe get her perspective.</p>
<p>He writes me an apology letter.</p>
<p>We deleted it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all water under the bridge.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ve been trying to tell people,</p>
<p>you have to be very careful when this gets too personal</p>
<p>because you are dog whistling to crazy people</p>
<p>who then might do something crazy.</p>
<p>Anyway, end of story.</p>
<p>I backed off the whole discussion</p>
<p>because I wanna finish my second book</p>
<p>and I wanna do podcasts with guys like you</p>
<p>and have a great time with my life</p>
<p>and not be involved with a bunch of idiots.</p>
<p>End of story.</p>
<p>So I wanna go back to this</p>
<p>Overton window concept for a second.</p>
<p>So again, just my idea.</p>
<p>So you take the word matters.</p>
<p>The word matters is in the Overton window.</p>
<p>Nobody can argue that the word matters is offensive.</p>
<p>If you prepend that word with vegetables,</p>
<p>it stays in the Overton window.</p>
<p>If you put looking both ways before you cross the street,</p>
<p>matters.</p>
<p>Okay, we&rsquo;re still there.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re in the Overton window.</p>
<p>If you say black lives as a term,</p>
<p>just without the word matters,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s probably in the Overton window.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>If black lives matters, it&rsquo;s out the Overton window.</p>
<p>And both sides politicize.</p>
<p>I think the left politicizes with this cancel culture</p>
<p>and basically like an extreme form of political correctness.</p>
<p>And then the right politicizes by,</p>
<p>in their way, a vein of hypersensitivity</p>
<p>and then a doubling down on this notion</p>
<p>of an attacking of individual freedoms and free speech.</p>
<p>And in all of that,</p>
<p>both of these two groups miss the fact</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re both sort of the same</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re wronged in the same way,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re both not listening in the same way.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So if I had to put something in the Overton window</p>
<p>that would address the US-China Cold War thing,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s what I would say.</p>
<p>We all need energy.</p>
<p>We all need food and we all need technology, right?</p>
<p>We need to sort of warm our houses.</p>
<p>We need to feed our bellies</p>
<p>and we need to be able to be productive in some way</p>
<p>so that we can make money.</p>
<p>And I think that everybody in the United States</p>
<p>can agree that on these three dimensions,</p>
<p>there are some really simple things that we could do</p>
<p>that basically double down on US sovereignty</p>
<p>and allow us to basically be more on the offensive.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll give you a couple of ideas.</p>
<p>On the energy side is we need to continue</p>
<p>to support energy independence</p>
<p>and that will require subsidies.</p>
<p>And the reason why that&rsquo;s important in my opinion</p>
<p>is that then what happens is</p>
<p>it hastens and accelerates Russia and the Middle East</p>
<p>not becoming relevant anymore</p>
<p>because they are forced to monetize their oil sooner.</p>
<p>The Middle East probably disintegrates into 30 countries.</p>
<p>The Middle East was just a kind of a random exercise</p>
<p>of basically Americans and Europeans</p>
<p>after the war divvying up a bunch of things.</p>
<p>It has no sensitivity to culture or language or anything.</p>
<p>So that probably goes to in a very different direction.</p>
<p>And Russia becomes less important</p>
<p>because they just have to monetize</p>
<p>otherwise they will lose their only source of revenue.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s one thing on energy that I think we could do</p>
<p>that I think is relatively politically acceptable</p>
<p>and inside the Overton window.</p>
<p>Second is on food, which is that we have to double down</p>
<p>on creating a completely independent food supply</p>
<p>inside the United States.</p>
<p>And there are ways again</p>
<p>where if we don&rsquo;t need to be building tanks</p>
<p>and having $90 trillion programs</p>
<p>for aircraft carriers anymore,</p>
<p>we could pour that money into US farms</p>
<p>and give people like Friedberg a lot more money</p>
<p>to go and actually make sure</p>
<p>the United States has food security.</p>
<p>That in any situation and scenario</p>
<p>we can feed the 330 odd million people</p>
<p>inside of our borders.</p>
<p>And then the third thing is on technology</p>
<p>which is there are a critical bunch of inputs</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s 5G chips, rare earth materials or minerals,</p>
<p>things like cobalt and lithium</p>
<p>which we need for batteries for climate change</p>
<p>that we can go and basically co-opt</p>
<p>because those things are concentrated in countries</p>
<p>like Chile, in places like Africa</p>
<p>where we can actually do a better job</p>
<p>of instilling governance and security.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s my Jason back to your thing.</p>
<p>These aren&rsquo;t sexy ideas, but they would work.</p>
<p>And I think they would work by both Republicans</p>
<p>and Democrats and it&rsquo;s non-controversial.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll even punch up the food part.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no reason why,</p>
<p>the same way we made water and public schools</p>
<p>kind of a given in the United States,</p>
<p>nobody really has to worry about getting water.</p>
<p>Nobody has to worry about getting</p>
<p>a basic education learning to read.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say it&rsquo;s not perfect obviously.</p>
<p>Why not make healthy produce</p>
<p>and some amount of healthy food</p>
<p>so affordable in the United States</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s essentially free, right?</p>
<p>And then you think about food security,</p>
<p>like how are we still discussing food security</p>
<p>with the amount of money and prosperity</p>
<p>we have in this country?</p>
<p>Make it free.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve almost made energy free.</p>
<p>We have energy independence.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll say a Manhattan project to make energy</p>
<p>and food as free or de minimis as water</p>
<p>would be just an amazing thing for us to rally around</p>
<p>because then people can work on the next thing</p>
<p>in their life, their careers, their family, their pursuits.</p>
<p>Friedberg, what do you think of the Overton window</p>
<p>and would you add something to it</p>
<p>that we can all agree on that we could work on together</p>
<p>and maybe unify the country</p>
<p>as opposed to pulling guns on each other</p>
<p>in the parking lots because of the color of our skin?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m reminded of a great moment in history</p>
<p>when Will Smith and his friends blew up the UFO</p>
<p>that came to attack Earth.</p>
<p>Nothing brings us together like a common enemy.</p>
<p>So it could be that the unification is gonna be in part</p>
<p>driven by this Cold War II</p>
<p>and creating a common enemy in China</p>
<p>is gonna work for both the right and the left</p>
<p>and create a lot of opportunity of Chamath Highlights</p>
<p>in manufacturing and food production.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of tools available to us.</p>
<p>I think we could all sit here and speculate</p>
<p>and I could pitch and plug all the companies</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m involved in that I think are gonna play a role.</p>
<p>But I do think it&rsquo;s that moment where</p>
<p>we are gonna coalesce around a common enemy and-</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;d be good if you actually shared</p>
<p>one or two of those projects you&rsquo;re working on if you can.</p>
<p>I actually would like to hear what you&rsquo;re working on.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve shared this before, but I do think biomanufacturing,</p>
<p>which is the technology whereby we engineer</p>
<p>the DNA of microbes and those microbes</p>
<p>then make molecules for us in a big fermentation tank</p>
<p>in the same way that we make beer or wine.</p>
<p>Biomanufacturing can be used to make flavors and fragrances.</p>
<p>And now we&rsquo;re making materials like silks and plastics,</p>
<p>plastic equivalents, and more interestingly,</p>
<p>proteins for human consumption to replace animal proteins.</p>
<p>And the cost of production and the cost of energy</p>
<p>associated with making these materials, these molecules,</p>
<p>these proteins through biomanufacturing</p>
<p>is literally several orders of magnitude less</p>
<p>than the traditional technique, which is just insane</p>
<p>if you think about it on a first principles basis,</p>
<p>of growing fucking corn, feeding it to a cow,</p>
<p>letting the cow grow up,</p>
<p>feeding it hundreds of gallons of water,</p>
<p>killing it, chopping it up, transporting it to a restaurant.</p>
<p>I mean, the amount of energy that goes into</p>
<p>making a pound of ground beef is insane.</p>
<p>And the greenhouse gas emissions and so on.</p>
<p>So I do believe that there is a big wave of biomanufacturing</p>
<p>as an industry that is coming on the US this century.</p>
<p>And it will hopefully by the end of the century</p>
<p>be the primary way that we&rsquo;re kind of producing</p>
<p>a lot of the molecules that we consume</p>
<p>and that we use for clothing and materials.</p>
<p>So then that does what to factories?</p>
<p>Because, you know, you did explain earlier</p>
<p>the number of factories.</p>
<p>If we can bioproduce not only our steaks,</p>
<p>not only our corn, does that also mean</p>
<p>we could biomanufacture steel, plastics, cars?</p>
<p>Not so much steel, but alternatives to leather,</p>
<p>alternatives to cloth, alternatives to-</p>
<p>So clothes.</p>
<p>To clothes, food.</p>
<p>So imagine instead of a traditional factory,</p>
<p>think about a factory historically being purpose-built.</p>
<p>So you build all these components to make one thing.</p>
<p>So you spent all this money making a giant machine</p>
<p>that you put stuff in on one end</p>
<p>and the same thing comes out over and over the other end.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s classic industrial revolution 1.0</p>
<p>and 20th century industrial revolution output.</p>
<p>In this century, we are gonna build these giant printers.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not gonna be single form machines</p>
<p>that make one thing over and over.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re gonna be systems that are giant fermentation tanks.</p>
<p>And in those fermentation tanks,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like you program them with software.</p>
<p>And the software in this case is genetic software.</p>
<p>You edit the genome of these organisms.</p>
<p>They take stuff on the input</p>
<p>and they make on the output a bunch of different stuff.</p>
<p>A replicator like in Star Trek,</p>
<p>and if there was seasonality</p>
<p>and people needed something over the summer for July 4th</p>
<p>versus what they need in Christmas</p>
<p>or in the winter and ski season,</p>
<p>the same factory makes that thing.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 years</p>
<p>from this having an impact on the economy?</p>
<p>Yes, and we&rsquo;re seeing it now.</p>
<p>I mean, look, the number of artificial animal protein</p>
<p>companies and the funding that they&rsquo;re getting</p>
<p>is I think highlighting investor interest and appetite</p>
<p>and backing the CapEx needed</p>
<p>to get this to become a reality right now.</p>
<p>Perfect Day just raised $300 million this week.</p>
<p>Impossible Foods raised $400 million</p>
<p>from the Qatari Investment Authority.</p>
<p>You know, obviously Beyond Meat is where they&rsquo;re at.</p>
<p>I mean, these companies are using these techniques</p>
<p>of genetic engineering to make microbes</p>
<p>that make the proteins and the flavorings</p>
<p>that can replace this stuff.</p>
<p>We put $500 million into the PPP program.</p>
<p>If we put $500 billion into this,</p>
<p>how much would it accelerate it?</p>
<p>Pretty substantially, and I think it goes</p>
<p>from food to pharma to materials,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s probably where you would see the impact.</p>
<p>But again, one system can make different materials,</p>
<p>can make different proteins.</p>
<p>So we could be independent of other countries</p>
<p>for food, to Chamath&rsquo;s point, and also pharma,</p>
<p>which we are way too dependent, correct, on China?</p>
<p>Yeah, we&rsquo;re definitely a net exporter.</p>
<p>By the way, you know, our largest export partner is China.</p>
<p>So most of our soybeans in the United States</p>
<p>that we produce, and soybeans are grown</p>
<p>on 160 million acres in the US,</p>
<p>and it rotates half and half each year with corn,</p>
<p>but about two-thirds of our soybeans</p>
<p>historically get exported to China.</p>
<p>So we are already food secure</p>
<p>from a net resource perspective.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just the rest of the infrastructure</p>
<p>in terms of turning that stuff into meat</p>
<p>and other stuff is where we&rsquo;re, you know,</p>
<p>we probably have to build up a little bit</p>
<p>of infrastructure and security.</p>
<p>Max, let&rsquo;s swing the ball over to you</p>
<p>when you hear the Overton Window ideas,</p>
<p>when you hear about this biochemistry,</p>
<p>slurry tank revolution that Friedberg&rsquo;s working on.</p>
<p>How does that change or evolve your view</p>
<p>of our relationship with China</p>
<p>and the political mess we&rsquo;re in right now in 2020?</p>
<p>Yeah, well, I think Cold War II does provide a lens</p>
<p>to rethink and reevaluate a lot</p>
<p>of these domestic political fights.</p>
<p>And so, for example, are the big technology companies,</p>
<p>you know, Google, Facebook, and so on,</p>
<p>are they these, you know, evil monopolies</p>
<p>that need to be broken up,</p>
<p>or are they the crown jewels of the American economy</p>
<p>that needs to be protected from Chinese espionage?</p>
<p>You know, is the free enterprise system</p>
<p>this, you know, horribly, you know,</p>
<p>oppressive, racist thing,</p>
<p>or is it actually the engine of prosperity</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s built this country?</p>
<p>You know, is freedom of speech an outdated principle,</p>
<p>or is it something we wanna, you know,</p>
<p>that that should be canceled,</p>
<p>or is it something we wanna fight for?</p>
<p>And I think that, you know,</p>
<p>when you start thinking about these issues,</p>
<p>you know, in the, you know,</p>
<p>through the lens of Cold War II,</p>
<p>it provides an option to kind of reevaluate them</p>
<p>and think about what&rsquo;s really important.</p>
<p>And hopefully it can provide a little bit</p>
<p>of a unifying force in America,</p>
<p>not because we want China to be an enemy,</p>
<p>but just because we want to maintain</p>
<p>a sense of national greatness.</p>
<p>And I, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not something we just wanna give up on.</p>
<p>I have a question for Friedberg.</p>
<p>Are schools gonna be back in the fall?</p>
<p>Because I cannot deal with my kids being at home.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think it&rsquo;s gonna be a mixed bag.</p>
<p>It seems like, I mean, if you follow this,</p>
<p>this is a political decision, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a scientific decision.</p>
<p>And so there are different politics around nationally</p>
<p>that are affecting this.</p>
<p>And there are some schools</p>
<p>that seem like they&rsquo;ve got processes</p>
<p>and methods of being comfortable.</p>
<p>Some of them who are just throwing everything out the window</p>
<p>and say, I don&rsquo;t give a shit,</p>
<p>the kid&rsquo;s gotta go back to school.</p>
<p>And some of them who are being very conservative</p>
<p>and saying, you know, we&rsquo;re not ready for that.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t take the risk.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ll definitely see a mixed bag.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know where you&rsquo;re living, Chamath.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s gonna happen per se,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s definitely a local policy question.</p>
<p>Is it safe, Friedberg?</p>
<p>Is it safe to send our kids back to a 10-person pod</p>
<p>in a school in California?</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s like asking</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s safe to cross a train track.</p>
<p>You know, you can look left, you can look right,</p>
<p>but yeah, you&rsquo;re crossing, you know,</p>
<p>a busy train intersection during rush hour, right?</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s hard to say what level of safe is safe.</p>
<p>We know that kids are less susceptible</p>
<p>to any sort of health risk themselves from the virus.</p>
<p>And it looks like there&rsquo;s a lot of studies</p>
<p>showing that the virus is less transmissible through kids,</p>
<p>especially kids under the age of 14.</p>
<p>And so it seems like there&rsquo;s some theories</p>
<p>that say that, look, it&rsquo;s these ACE2 receptors</p>
<p>whereby the virus enters the cells</p>
<p>really start to present when you turn 10 years old</p>
<p>at a greater rate and, you know, it scales up to 14</p>
<p>and above 14, you&rsquo;re kind of an adult</p>
<p>from an ACE2 receptor point of view.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s the severity of the infection,</p>
<p>as we all know, is really more of a significant issue</p>
<p>for much elderly people.</p>
<p>So when you take those factors into account,</p>
<p>the virus is likely less transmissible amongst children.</p>
<p>Therefore, a bunch of kids get together,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not gonna transmit it to each other.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s likely gonna be less severe</p>
<p>even if there is an infection for kids.</p>
<p>The risk is just about, are the teachers comfortable</p>
<p>and what happens when they go home?</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;ve been a number of letters</p>
<p>that you guys have probably seen,</p>
<p>op-eds and whatnot written in papers</p>
<p>by teachers saying, I&rsquo;m nervous to go back to school.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna teach this fall.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna take the risk for my health.</p>
<p>I take care of my mom or my dad or what have you.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s a lot of competing interests here</p>
<p>besides just the science.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go around the horn</p>
<p>of who&rsquo;s sending their kids back to school.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll start, I posted on calacanis.com yesterday</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve decided as a family</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re starting a micro school.</p>
<p>We put out a call for a teacher</p>
<p>and just looking at teacher salaries,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t get paid particularly well in our society.</p>
<p>As we all know, they&rsquo;re underpaid.</p>
<p>So we think we can come over the top</p>
<p>and provide a better financial arrangement</p>
<p>for a teacher and then have one to five students.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re gonna just create a micro school.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s our current plan.</p>
<p>Our kids did go to camp this summer</p>
<p>in a small 10 person or less pod.</p>
<p>And we felt that was safe.</p>
<p>Everybody was tested and it was outdoors.</p>
<p>But for me being indoors at a school with 300 pods of 10,</p>
<p>and I think the best teachers are not gonna show up</p>
<p>and my kids don&rsquo;t learn over Zoom.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know about your kids, but it&rsquo;s not working.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re gonna roll our own school</p>
<p>and hopefully find one or two families</p>
<p>who wanna chop up the cost with us</p>
<p>or we&rsquo;ll just pick up the tab</p>
<p>and invite one or two families</p>
<p>if they don&rsquo;t have the means to do it.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;re gonna go solo for 2021.</p>
<p>Freeberg, Sharmath, what are you thinking right now?</p>
<p>Because we&rsquo;re only seven, eight weeks out from this, right?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re less than two months.</p>
<p>I really think like, look, not everybody, Jason,</p>
<p>is gonna be in a position to hire teachers.</p>
<p>In fact, most everybody won&rsquo;t be.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s, I wanna send my children back to school.</p>
<p>I refuse to create some alternative reality for them.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s really important</p>
<p>that they are with their friends.</p>
<p>I think that we&rsquo;re not really thinking strongly enough</p>
<p>about the social implications for children.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just say like, you take an eight year old</p>
<p>or a nine year old or a 10 year old</p>
<p>and you deprive them of their friends for a year.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s an enormous part of their life.</p>
<p>Where they&rsquo;ve-</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a prison sentence, yeah.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve been socially isolated.</p>
<p>I just think it&rsquo;s a really bad outcome.</p>
<p>So I think that obviously from a public health perspective,</p>
<p>we wanna keep our teachers safe.</p>
<p>I just think that it&rsquo;s so important that we realize</p>
<p>that we are going to impact an entire generation of kids.</p>
<p>I think that if you&rsquo;re 18 or 19</p>
<p>and have had 18 or 19 years of normal teenage-dom</p>
<p>and growing up that it&rsquo;s okay if you miss a year</p>
<p>or you have to do your first year of college remotely.</p>
<p>Like it sucks, but you can deal.</p>
<p>But I really worry about these kids</p>
<p>in primary school and middle school.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really unfair.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, our plan was to try to get</p>
<p>to four or five students, a small bubble</p>
<p>and then have outdoor.</p>
<p>The problem is then the Northeast-</p>
<p>Having gone to school, it&rsquo;s you&rsquo;re inside</p>
<p>with a heating system, with a closed ventilation system</p>
<p>that was built in 1920.</p>
<p>And I think it avoids the real key thing,</p>
<p>which is like, I don&rsquo;t think you go to school to learn</p>
<p>as much as you go to school to-</p>
<p>Socialize.</p>
<p>Socialize.</p>
<p>I mean, you learn as a by-product</p>
<p>because everybody socializes, not everybody learns.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Agreed.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s an enormously important formative experience</p>
<p>for a child to be around 15 or 20 of their other kids</p>
<p>and to be in the playground, to deal with all the adversity</p>
<p>that comes with normal life of a kid.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the biggest thing that I think</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re depriving them of.</p>
<p>And I understand that, you know,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an important reason to hold these kids back.</p>
<p>But I just want to appreciate that behaviorally</p>
<p>and psychologically, this is not going to be for free.</p>
<p>Free, Sax, what&rsquo;s your latest thinking?</p>
<p>I guess I agree with both Chamath and Freeberg on this,</p>
<p>that there are huge benefits to going back</p>
<p>and the risks to kids are low in terms of getting it.</p>
<p>And also they&rsquo;re less viral if they do.</p>
<p>But Israel is sort of a strong recent counterexample</p>
<p>where they recently opened schools</p>
<p>and now all of a sudden they&rsquo;ve got a spike.</p>
<p>So, you know, we&rsquo;re going to send our kids back,</p>
<p>but I expect it to be a little bit of a shit show.</p>
<p>I think that the schools will reopen</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll do all this planning.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;ll be all these like pods and half days</p>
<p>and smaller groups and that kind of thing.</p>
<p>And then somebody&rsquo;s going to, there&rsquo;ll be like one case,</p>
<p>either a kid or, you know, one family.</p>
<p>And then all of a sudden they&rsquo;re going to shut down again.</p>
<p>And I guess, you know,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re spending all this time planning,</p>
<p>but I wonder if they&rsquo;re really going to have</p>
<p>contingency plans for what happens when there&rsquo;s a case.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s exactly what I think is happening.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think they&rsquo;ll just shut down.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s too scary for a child to die or a teacher to die</p>
<p>and people, the overreaction to it</p>
<p>will be to shut everything down, right?</p>
<p>And then we&rsquo;re going to be back to our kids.</p>
<p>When we sent our kids to camp</p>
<p>for the three weeks they went,</p>
<p>man, it was just, they were different kids, right?</p>
<p>And to Chamath&rsquo;s point, they&rsquo;re little social animals.</p>
<p>They need to roll around like little baby tigers and play.</p>
<p>And if they don&rsquo;t have that,</p>
<p>it dramatically affects behavior.</p>
<p>And we saw it in only three months.</p>
<p>I mean, 12 months, these kids are going to go mental.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think that basically where the country is at</p>
<p>is that we&rsquo;re an undeclared Sweden.</p>
<p>You know, we&rsquo;ve basically, the virus has become endemic.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s everywhere.</p>
<p>You know, we&rsquo;ve basically given up</p>
<p>on trying to contain or stop it.</p>
<p>And so now we&rsquo;re just on this path to herd immunity.</p>
<p>And, you know, it&rsquo;s basically what Sweden did,</p>
<p>except we haven&rsquo;t declared that&rsquo;s what our plan is.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s haphazard and,</p>
<p>but it seems like kind of we&rsquo;re, by default,</p>
<p>just headed for herd immunity.</p>
<p>Freeberg, as we wrap up here,</p>
<p>and I got one final question I want to do after this,</p>
<p>and then we&rsquo;ll wrap.</p>
<p>Freeberg, what&rsquo;s your thoughts?</p>
<p>Kids in schools, I know you have kids.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure the ages, if they&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>would be going back to a,</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;re a little bit on the younger side.</p>
<p>So if you did have eight, nine, 10, 12 year olds,</p>
<p>sending them back to school, starting your own,</p>
<p>what are your thoughts?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, I would probably be a little ridiculous</p>
<p>and send them and test them every other day at home.</p>
<p>And, you know, you can get this Vector Dickinson</p>
<p>testing system now for 250 bucks.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a handheld device.</p>
<p>And these test strips cost 20 bucks.</p>
<p>Say the name of it again.</p>
<p>The Vector Dickinson.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the company that makes it.</p>
<p>Vector with a V.</p>
<p>B, B, B.</p>
<p>Wait, how do I, are they available?</p>
<p>Yeah, you can buy them through medical retailers.</p>
<p>And yeah, the handheld device that they use</p>
<p>in hospitals and stuff today, it&rsquo;s 250 bucks.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a little test kit that you buy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll probably cost 20 to 30 bucks.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll be available next month per test or 15 to 20 bucks.</p>
<p>And it takes five minutes to get a result.</p>
<p>And so-</p>
<p>You literally could do it in the schoolyard</p>
<p>before they go into the building.</p>
<p>Yeah, so you could test.</p>
<p>I would test my kids every day.</p>
<p>If I had, you know, my kids are,</p>
<p>my one kid&rsquo;s in preschool.</p>
<p>The other one&rsquo;s two years old.</p>
<p>But you gotta do a little pin prick on their finger, right?</p>
<p>No, no, you could just do a little swab in the nose.</p>
<p>Oh, okay.</p>
<p>Yeah, and you can test them every-</p>
<p>Deep nose swab or, you know, halfway?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s data that shows now</p>
<p>that you could actually do a throat swab</p>
<p>and, you know, get a pretty good reading on it.</p>
<p>So, you know, whatever the protocol is,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;d probably be pretty non-invasive</p>
<p>and you could get a result.</p>
<p>Now, that&rsquo;s expensive for most people.</p>
<p>You know, that&rsquo;s-</p>
<p>Not expensive for a school.</p>
<p>Not expensive for a school, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>And so I think that company will do well</p>
<p>with that testing system they&rsquo;ve launched</p>
<p>because it actually tests, not for the RNA,</p>
<p>but for the protein.</p>
<p>Is this a public company?</p>
<p>Yeah, and the stock&rsquo;s done well.</p>
<p>And this test does really well</p>
<p>because it tests for the protein, not the RNA.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s actually a much, you know,</p>
<p>much easier test scientifically to do.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not trying to pick up specific nucleotides</p>
<p>or nucleic acids.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re trying to pick up a protein.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s, yeah, it&rsquo;s pretty effective.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>If the election was held today,</p>
<p>we always like to talk about this a bit.</p>
<p>The audience loves when we talk about it.</p>
<p>We talked about Oprah last time.</p>
<p>That was our sleeper candidate.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m changing, I&rsquo;m changing.</p>
<p>Tammy Duckworth, Tammy Duckworth</p>
<p>is now my sleeper vice presidential.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m with it, I&rsquo;m with the Chamath on that.</p>
<p>Absolutely, 100.</p>
<p>Now, who&rsquo;s gonna win if the election was held today?</p>
<p>Sax, I&rsquo;ll let you go first</p>
<p>since it&rsquo;s the most heartbreaking for you.</p>
<p>Biden&rsquo;s strategy is working.</p>
<p>His strategy is basically to say nothing,</p>
<p>to be, you know, to hide in his basement.</p>
<p>And, but it&rsquo;s working because even though he&rsquo;s a cypher,</p>
<p>I think people, he&rsquo;s basically a protest vote against Trump</p>
<p>and Trump, you know, is, you know,</p>
<p>seen as very divisive and inflammatory.</p>
<p>And I think the American people at this point</p>
<p>just wanna push a button and make it stop.</p>
<p>And right now Biden seems like the make it stop button.</p>
<p>Yeah, okay.</p>
<p>And should Biden, I&rsquo;ll add to the question,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;ll be two, we&rsquo;ll end on this double question.</p>
<p>Who wins today and should Biden debate Trump</p>
<p>or is it better for him to just opt out of the debates</p>
<p>and not risk it?</p>
<p>Biden&rsquo;s strategy- What would you advise?</p>
<p>Well, I think Biden&rsquo;s strategy right now is working.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why he would change it.</p>
<p>I mean, his goal- So he should not,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s three debates on the books he agreed to.</p>
<p>Should he do the three debates, yes or no?</p>
<p>If you were advising him.</p>
<p>So I think he probably will not be able</p>
<p>to duck these debates forever.</p>
<p>I think, I mean, it seems unlikely that, you know-</p>
<p>If you were advising him,</p>
<p>would you tell him to do it or not?</p>
<p>I would tell him his strategy is working,</p>
<p>which is to say nothing and-</p>
<p>So don&rsquo;t go to the debates.</p>
<p>If you can get away with it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure he&rsquo;ll be able to get away with it.</p>
<p>So I think eventually people,</p>
<p>eventually the American public will turn its attention</p>
<p>to the election.</p>
<p>But part of the reason why his strategy is working</p>
<p>is because Trump is running such a bad campaign.</p>
<p>In fact, it feels like Trump</p>
<p>hasn&rsquo;t even really started to campaign.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no logic to it for sure.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s, you know, normally what the incumbent does,</p>
<p>especially when they&rsquo;ve got a lot of money,</p>
<p>is they use the summer to define the opponent.</p>
<p>They start running a lot of ads</p>
<p>seeking to define their opponent.</p>
<p>And, you know, where are those ads?</p>
<p>Where is that attempt to define Biden?</p>
<p>I mean, I think it&rsquo;s hard because,</p>
<p>you know, it&rsquo;s hard to define Biden as a radical</p>
<p>who represents these woke mobs.</p>
<p>Biden doesn&rsquo;t even know how to say the word woke correctly.</p>
<p>I think he&rsquo;s called him woked.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s actually helpful.</p>
<p>I was woke last night by my four-year-old</p>
<p>who needed her diaper changed.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>But the fact that Biden is so clueless</p>
<p>and seems like so out of touch actually helps him</p>
<p>because, I mean, the way for Trump to win the election,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s put it that way,</p>
<p>is to make the alternative to Trump</p>
<p>the destruction of Mount Rushmore, right?</p>
<p>I mean, if Trump can somehow convince the American public</p>
<p>that the election of Joe Biden means</p>
<p>the ripping down of George Washington</p>
<p>and Abraham Lincoln and Mount Rushmore</p>
<p>and the destruction of capitalism,</p>
<p>that is the way for him to win.</p>
<p>But he has to actually-</p>
<p>Listen?</p>
<p>He has to actually be able to tag Biden with that-</p>
<p>Why did Peter Thiel drop Trump?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got a 30-year relationship with Peter Thiel.</p>
<p>You talk to him on the regular.</p>
<p>Why did Thiel drop him?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know that he has.</p>
<p>I think you have to get him on the show to talk.</p>
<p>All right, there you go, good deflection.</p>
<p>Best he see, who wins?</p>
<p>And should he do those three debates, Biden?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, I think you can&rsquo;t get away from them.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t make it a big issue</p>
<p>because the debates are gonna be</p>
<p>kind of this random, crappy kind of experience.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even know whether they&rsquo;ll be in the same place.</p>
<p>I think they should try to make sure</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re not in the same place</p>
<p>so that it&rsquo;s done almost over Zoom.</p>
<p>Like, you can cripple the usefulness of these debates.</p>
<p>In many ways, there really isn&rsquo;t much</p>
<p>that can happen in the debates.</p>
<p>The reality is that people aren&rsquo;t voting for Biden.</p>
<p>They are voting against Donald Trump.</p>
<p>Any chance Trump wins?</p>
<p>And they are voting against the sheer incompetence</p>
<p>of him and his family.</p>
<p>And, you know, it&rsquo;s going to be very difficult</p>
<p>for him to overturn it.</p>
<p>There is one thin path for him to win,</p>
<p>which is to absolutely shower America with money</p>
<p>close to the election day.</p>
<p>So if there is a multi, multi-trillion dollar</p>
<p>stimulus bill that passes,</p>
<p>and it literally puts money into the hands</p>
<p>of working Americans, especially in the swing states,</p>
<p>it could work.</p>
<p>Now, the one thing I&rsquo;ll tell you is</p>
<p>if you looked at the exit polls in Georgia,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s scary because there were 230,000, I think,</p>
<p>more Democrats out of the exit polls in the Georgia primary</p>
<p>than there were Republican.</p>
<p>Now, just hold the phone here for a second</p>
<p>because under no calculus on electoral college</p>
<p>did we ever have to think that there was probabilistically</p>
<p>any chance that a Democrat wins Georgia.</p>
<p>And I think what this speaks to is a changing demographic</p>
<p>longitudinally, and this is not a racial thing,</p>
<p>meaning this is an age thing,</p>
<p>where these young people are very different politically.</p>
<p>And so if you think that there is an even remote chance</p>
<p>that Donald Trump loses Georgia,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t even worry about Minnesota and Pennsylvania</p>
<p>and Florida because he would have already lost those</p>
<p>in order to lose Georgia.</p>
<p>Also, this pandemic and work from home</p>
<p>is gonna result in people,</p>
<p>if it is a sustained work from home.</p>
<p>We have scarred the American economy, guys,</p>
<p>and we don&rsquo;t know the extent of the injury</p>
<p>because you know the extent of the injury</p>
<p>when you step out of the chair,</p>
<p>that first moment the casket&rsquo;s taken off</p>
<p>and you put a little pressure on the leg</p>
<p>to see how bad it is.</p>
<p>And we don&rsquo;t know how bad it is,</p>
<p>except we know that it&rsquo;s pretty bad.</p>
<p>So, you know, I think that all roads</p>
<p>kind of look like Biden.</p>
<p>I think the very narrow path that Donald Trump has</p>
<p>is, you know, a multi, multi trillion dollar stimulus bill</p>
<p>directly into the hands of Americans.</p>
<p>Friedberg, is he gonna win yes or no?</p>
<p>Should he do the debates?</p>
<p>Yes or no?</p>
<p>Yeah, if the vote were to happen today,</p>
<p>he would win, Joe Biden would win.</p>
<p>I think he&rsquo;s actually more likely to win</p>
<p>based on news that just hit the wire,</p>
<p>which we haven&rsquo;t talked about today,</p>
<p>which is it looks like Facebook</p>
<p>is gonna ban all political ads this year.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And so if they do that,</p>
<p>obviously that&rsquo;s-</p>
<p>Facebook in a fight for survival right now,</p>
<p>that ad camp.</p>
<p>Amazing how a bunch of advertisers</p>
<p>taking a one month pause</p>
<p>all of a sudden brings Zuckerberg to the table.</p>
<p>Amazing how my well-timed short thesis tweet</p>
<p>playing out right now.</p>
<p>Oh, yum, yum.</p>
<p>So I think that obviously works to Biden&rsquo;s favor.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>If that&rsquo;s the case.</p>
<p>And then my point on the debates,</p>
<p>if I were Biden, what I would do right now</p>
<p>is I would go on Twitter</p>
<p>and I would say, release your tax returns</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll debate you.</p>
<p>And I would repeat that tweet twice a day.</p>
<p>Love it, love it.</p>
<p>And basically turn the thing around.</p>
<p>Friedberg gets the dunk.</p>
<p>360 dunk, he jumps in.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a dunk.</p>
<p>Vince Carter.</p>
<p>Well done, Friedbergers.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s over, Friedberg wins the debate.</p>
<p>This show is sponsored by nobody.</p>
<p>However, I&rsquo;m going to ask my bestie, C,</p>
<p>if somebody were to make a $25,000 donation to charity,</p>
<p>would you allow me to read an ad</p>
<p>for 30 seconds during the pot at some point?</p>
<p>No, but I&rsquo;ll match it to wherever you want to go.</p>
<p>No fucking ads ever.</p>
<p>Oh, God damn it.</p>
<p>I love you guys.</p>
<p>I miss you.</p>
<p>Love you.</p>
<p>Love you, bestie C.</p>
<p>Bye, boys.</p>
<p>I love you.</p>
<p>Love you, Fried.</p>
<p>Love you, Sax.</p>
<p>It was great playing golf.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s golf.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s fucking golf, man.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m losing my mind.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll see you later.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s do a little small little NASA, boys.</p>
<p>A little 10,000, you know.</p>
<p>Ooh, ooh, ooh, let&rsquo;s go, let&rsquo;s gamble.</p>
<p>See you next time on the All In podcast.</p>
<p>Tell your friends to tune in</p>
<p>if they want to listen to something intelligent.</p>
<p>Bye-bye.</p>
