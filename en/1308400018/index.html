    <p>hi friends today we&rsquo;re talking about self-love and why you ain&rsquo;t got none</p>
<p>not really I&rsquo;m gonna debunk this shit for you okay cuz everybody online be</p>
<p>preaching all kind of you just need to love yourself you need to love yourself</p>
<p>but they don&rsquo;t give you steps of how to fucking do it okay and they don&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>know what they&rsquo;re talking about half the time people that&rsquo;s just a good thing to</p>
<p>say it&rsquo;s like a politically correct answer like when someone comes to you</p>
<p>with some fucking problem you just say you need to learn how to love yourself</p>
<p>like bitch fuck off so I&rsquo;m gonna debunk all that and then I&rsquo;m gonna give you</p>
<p>like a step-by-step guide kind of of like what to do how to do it you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna see you&rsquo;re gonna like it a whole bunch I promise but I do need to</p>
<p>acknowledge I&rsquo;m sick I&rsquo;m sick as a fucking dog right now okay I&rsquo;m like I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>really upset no bitch I&rsquo;m just sick I have a cold like going to this festival</p>
<p>I just went to I went to Okeechobee last weekend and girl I&rsquo;m still sick and I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>fucking annoyed by it okay like all my friends when we go to festivals they be</p>
<p>like depressed and upset and like they&rsquo;d be a little chemically imbalanced cuz</p>
<p>we&rsquo;d be rolling and shit but that&rsquo;s all they got to worry about I gotta have a</p>
<p>fucking cold on the end of it like bitch I&rsquo;m depressed I&rsquo;m upset I&rsquo;m sad and I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>fucking full of snot are you kidding me like everybody else just seems to like</p>
<p>recover so fast but my weak-ass immune system be tearing my ass up like how</p>
<p>embarrassing is that like how pussy is that of me to always be getting sick</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s embarrassing also I have officially turned 24 my birthday was</p>
<p>March 7th and I hid it I kept it a secret I didn&rsquo;t tell anybody it was my</p>
<p>birthday cuz I didn&rsquo;t want no like theatrics and shit online or like people</p>
<p>posting like yeah like it was sweet a couple people did but I just didn&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>to make it a big fucking deal you know like I&rsquo;m upset I don&rsquo;t want to be 24 I</p>
<p>still feel like I&rsquo;m 15 what the hell is this you know like you I don&rsquo;t want to</p>
<p>fucking grow up but yeah I&rsquo;m 24 now so I changed all my bios which hurts my</p>
<p>heart every year like all my social media bios I gotta change it now I&rsquo;m 24</p>
<p>not 23 y&rsquo;all I&rsquo;m stressed like growing up is like some bullshit this is a</p>
<p>gimmick okay I like it doesn&rsquo;t feel right it doesn&rsquo;t feel like this is</p>
<p>supposed to be happening you know like I don&rsquo;t feel like an adult but like I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>officially like adult now like these are adult years I&rsquo;m in and I still feel like</p>
<p>a fucking child you know like I know a bunch of things I&rsquo;m real smart but I</p>
<p>still feel like a kid anyways let&rsquo;s go into this self-love topic okay so first</p>
<p>thing I&rsquo;m gonna say about love and like loving something to love something is a</p>
<p>verb it&rsquo;s an action to love okay a lot of things online and a lot of people</p>
<p>make it seem like self-love is just this thing that you have or don&rsquo;t have it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just this magical feeling that pops out of your fucking ass of like oh my god I</p>
<p>love myself and you just feel this certain way towards yourself and like oh</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s self-love no scratch that that ain&rsquo;t fucking true that ain&rsquo;t real don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>base your opinion of yourself and if you love yourself or not off of that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not fair okay because you&rsquo;re gonna be striving for that you ain&rsquo;t never gonna</p>
<p>get it sorry but that&rsquo;s not what it is so it&rsquo;s like people are teaching you</p>
<p>this like false idea of what the fuck it should be it&rsquo;s not so like I said to</p>
<p>love something is a verb so what you need to look at is your actions is the</p>
<p>way you treat yourself loving or is it not loving is the way you live your life</p>
<p>loving or not loving toward yourself that&rsquo;s the way I want to like help you</p>
<p>reframe your mindset on it because I used to be the person that was lost and</p>
<p>was like confused and I didn&rsquo;t understand what the fuck everybody meant</p>
<p>by this self-love shit online so like I&rsquo;m just sharing what I&rsquo;ve learned and</p>
<p>how I&rsquo;ve had to like reconstruct it in my mind to actually feel better and to</p>
<p>actually feel like I love myself you know and like make the changes that are</p>
<p>necessary but the first thing I want to make clear is it&rsquo;s not this magical</p>
<p>feeling it&rsquo;s not just this thing you have or don&rsquo;t have okay to love</p>
<p>something is an action so base it off of that are your actions self-loving am I</p>
<p>acting in a self-loving way so the other thing that you kind of get off the hook</p>
<p>with with looking at it like this is the definite do I love myself or do I</p>
<p>not when you look at your actions as self-loving or not self-loving there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>no way to say I love myself or I don&rsquo;t love myself because it&rsquo;s not an</p>
<p>all-the-time thing it bases off your actions and how you act and how you</p>
<p>treat yourself so you it&rsquo;s like if you do ten actions that are self-loving and</p>
<p>then you do one that&rsquo;s not loving it&rsquo;s not like oh I love myself and then oh</p>
<p>now I don&rsquo;t love myself it&rsquo;s you took actions that were self-loving and then</p>
<p>this one might not have been self-loving and that&rsquo;s another thing you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>fucking be loving toward yourself all the time like it&rsquo;s unrealistic to expect</p>
<p>that of yourself all the fucking time and especially if you&rsquo;re someone that</p>
<p>feels like you don&rsquo;t love yourself or you don&rsquo;t know how to love yourself you</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t just expect yourself to fully flip and like do everything right going</p>
<p>forward it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s unreasonable to expect that from anybody even the people</p>
<p>that have practiced this for a long time there&rsquo;s there you can&rsquo;t get it wrong</p>
<p>okay you can kinda but like if you can&rsquo;t get it right you can&rsquo;t get it wrong and</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s no absolutes then you&rsquo;re fine so it just depends on your actions and</p>
<p>how you treat yourself so I keep running on about that but I have 12 areas or</p>
<p>kind of like circumstances where things could be like self-loving or not and</p>
<p>these are like the areas that I&rsquo;ve come up with for my life that I kind of gauge</p>
<p>if I&rsquo;m loving myself or not so these are gonna also be like the step-by-steps of</p>
<p>how to love yourself if you don&rsquo;t like this is the the mindset shifts you need</p>
<p>to make and these are the shifts you need to make in your actions so I laid</p>
<p>this shit out for you babe all right let me get to my note it&rsquo;s on my phone so if</p>
<p>you hear me like tapping around on my phone that&rsquo;s what it is usually I write</p>
<p>this in a notebook but I was like real depressed in my bed last night and I</p>
<p>did not feel like getting up and I was trying to think of like what I was gonna</p>
<p>do for this fucking podcast and I just did it in my phone so that&rsquo;s what that</p>
<p>is and one more thing I need to bring up before we run into my little 12 steps</p>
<p>like but girl I did not realize it&rsquo;s the 12 step program no no we&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>alcoholics anonymous we are not narcotics anonymous this is self-hate</p>
<p>anonymous is that what the programs are is it 12 steps do I really have 12 oh my</p>
<p>girl I really do have 12 steps I did not mean it to go like this I just realized</p>
<p>this oh well the thing I wanted to say was if you feel like you don&rsquo;t love</p>
<p>yourself or if you do things that are like damaging to yourself and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>just like annoyed with yourself or you beat yourself up a lot or whatever it is</p>
<p>if you feel like you don&rsquo;t love yourself at some point in your life loving</p>
<p>yourself led to negative consequences okay you had to learn to stop loving</p>
<p>yourself in order to stay close to the people around you now this could have</p>
<p>started when you were very young or it could have been in your teenage years</p>
<p>whenever it was but at some point in your life loving yourself led to</p>
<p>negative consequences so you stopped considering yourself led to</p>
<p>disconnection or you were scared it was gonna lead to disconnection and like</p>
<p>losing people so you learn to discard yourself that&rsquo;s a that&rsquo;s another way you</p>
<p>can kind of break it down is looking at it like considering yourself and</p>
<p>prioritizing yourself doing that in the past led to you being hurt so you stopped</p>
<p>so have a little compassion for yourself be a little bit understanding and look</p>
<p>at why you stopped so once I once you get through listening to this fucking</p>
<p>episode of all the things my 12 steps look at why you stopped doing these</p>
<p>things I like what point in your life did you stop doing them and why did you</p>
<p>stop why did it not feel safe to care about the way that you felt and</p>
<p>prioritize yourself and consider yourself and make sure you were taken</p>
<p>care of okay you&rsquo;re gonna see that it led to negative consequences but I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>just kind of like throwing the answer at you but I really want you guys to like</p>
<p>think about it for yourself and that negative voice in the back of your head</p>
<p>so like the critical voice in your head that&rsquo;s like won&rsquo;t shut the fuck up and</p>
<p>is always mean to you if you look at why that voice is there that voice has your</p>
<p>back that voice is looking out for you the only reason that critical voice in</p>
<p>your head is so mean to you and is so on your fucking ass is because it&rsquo;s trying</p>
<p>to make you better but why is it trying to make you better so that you can be</p>
<p>loved that&rsquo;s the only goal behind that voice in your head that sounds like it</p>
<p>fucking hates you and is always on your ass and is always like doubting you and</p>
<p>second-guessing you and is like pushing you and is like way too hard on you</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the goal behind that voice is to make sure you stay connected to others</p>
<p>and make sure that you can get love so take a second to shift your perspective</p>
<p>of how you&rsquo;ve been looking at that negative voice in your head because it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>there to help you in a twisted fucked up way it&rsquo;s just trying to make sure you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>okay okay now let&rsquo;s move on to my 12 steps not really steps like my 12 areas</p>
<p>of places to check yourself and how you can start to love yourself so the first</p>
<p>one is your own happiness what is your relationship to your happiness and the</p>
<p>things that make you happy and bring you joy do you make time for those things do</p>
<p>you prioritize those things do you make those things important to you or do you</p>
<p>forget about them and discard them for other things or other people like if you</p>
<p>know that there&rsquo;s something that you want to do that will make you happy if</p>
<p>something else comes up with somebody else are you gonna throw away what you</p>
<p>want to do to make sure that they&rsquo;re happy you know what I mean are you gonna</p>
<p>sacrifice yourself are you gonna sacrifice what makes you happy so that</p>
<p>people don&rsquo;t get mad at you my point with this one is your happiness do you</p>
<p>prioritize it does your happiness matter to you does what makes you happy matter</p>
<p>to you I hope that was correct English because I just be talking shit because</p>
<p>someone that loves their self is gonna prioritize what makes them happy they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna prioritize making sure that they get to do what they want to do if</p>
<p>something brings them joy they&rsquo;re gonna make sure they get to do that you know</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna make time for that they&rsquo;re gonna make that a priority they&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>make their happiness a priority and I&rsquo;m not saying like that whole term of</p>
<p>happiness that everybody beats into you on social media and online is like not</p>
<p>that stereotypical fucking happiness definition I&rsquo;m talking about anything</p>
<p>small that you enjoy doing do you make time for it or do you throw it away for</p>
<p>others and if you do throw it away and you do discard doing what makes you</p>
<p>happy why do you do that look at why what are you scared is gonna happen who</p>
<p>are you scared you&rsquo;re gonna lose because I guarantee you it leads to some sort of</p>
<p>disconnection that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re scared of but that&rsquo;s for you to figure out okay</p>
<p>so number two my second area my second step of our 12-step program is the way</p>
<p>that you feel does the way that you feel matter to you does the fact that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>upset or sad or uncomfortable bother you when you feel uncomfortable do you take</p>
<p>action to try and feel better and to try and change something or do you just make</p>
<p>yourself shut up and deal with it do you discard the fact that you feel</p>
<p>uncomfortable or do you make it important to you because you don&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>yourself to have to deal with that does that make sense someone that loves</p>
<p>their self is not gonna let their self remain uncomfortable or if they&rsquo;re upset</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not gonna just brush that off or try and tell their self it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>important they&rsquo;re gonna take that into consideration they&rsquo;re gonna take the way</p>
<p>that they feel into consideration they&rsquo;re not gonna make their self do</p>
<p>things that make them feel negatively you know there&rsquo;s a difference between</p>
<p>being self-disciplined and doing things that sometimes you don&rsquo;t want to do</p>
<p>versus doing things that hurt you or make you feel disgusting and</p>
<p>uncomfortable like hanging out with certain people if you don&rsquo;t like hanging</p>
<p>out with certain people because they don&rsquo;t make you feel good or they talk</p>
<p>bad about you and it makes you feel bad about yourself someone who loves</p>
<p>their self is not gonna let their self hang out with those people someone who</p>
<p>loves their self is gonna prioritize the way that they feel and say fuck no I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>not letting you go through that they&rsquo;re gonna like care take their self if you</p>
<p>kind of got to look at it with like as two people and I like to bring up my</p>
<p>inner child into this it&rsquo;s like I wouldn&rsquo;t tell five-year-old me to go</p>
<p>deal with certain things if it made him upset like I would want to look out for</p>
<p>him and take care of him I wouldn&rsquo;t tell him to go deal with that shit like I</p>
<p>would grab his little hand like no we&rsquo;re not hanging out with them fuck them like</p>
<p>you know what I mean you have to be the same way with adult you you have to be</p>
<p>the same way with yourself you have to care about the way that you feel and</p>
<p>make that a priority that&rsquo;s loving yourself okay so my third point is look</p>
<p>at the attitude you have toward yourself so are you judgmental of</p>
<p>yourself are you fucking mean to yourself and I&rsquo;m not talking about the</p>
<p>critical voice in your head like there&rsquo;s like a critical voice that you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>really control and there&rsquo;s one that you can control you know so what&rsquo;s your</p>
<p>attitude toward yourself do you like beat yourself up for shit or do you try</p>
<p>to understand why you just did what you did so if you do something that seems</p>
<p>self-destructive or seems like bad are you just gonna start beating yourself up</p>
<p>for it like you&rsquo;re a fucking idiot you&rsquo;re a fucking dumbass like are you</p>
<p>stupid like how dumb can you be to do that are you gonna act like that towards</p>
<p>yourself or are you gonna look at yourself and be like okay why did you</p>
<p>just do that are you gonna try to understand what you were feeling and</p>
<p>what caused you to take that action or are you just gonna criticize yourself</p>
<p>for it because someone who loves their self is gonna try to understand why they</p>
<p>just did what they did and you are the only one that can fully understand you</p>
<p>you can experience firsthand the feelings you&rsquo;re feeling no one else can</p>
<p>so no one else can understand you as well as you can but do you even take the</p>
<p>time to understand why you feel the way that you do why you take the actions</p>
<p>that you do or do you just judge them as good or bad right and wrong do you like</p>
<p>self-soothe yourself or do you attack yourself because that criticism shit</p>
<p>will only get you so far like you if you&rsquo;re gonna be critical of yourself you</p>
<p>also need to give credit where it&rsquo;s due and someone who loves their self is</p>
<p>gonna give credit to their self so even if they don&rsquo;t achieve what they wanted</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna give credit to how hard they fucking tried because they know how</p>
<p>hard they tried they&rsquo;ll look at ways to do it better in the future they&rsquo;ll look</p>
<p>at ways to improve but they are also gonna give credit where it&rsquo;s due and not</p>
<p>just beat their self up you need to have both if you&rsquo;re gonna be critical you</p>
<p>need to be appreciative of yourself and congratulate yourself and like what is</p>
<p>it called like you need to be rooting for yourself and you need to hold</p>
<p>yourself accountable to like the good things you do if you&rsquo;re also gonna hold</p>
<p>accountable to the bad things you need to have both you can&rsquo;t just beat yourself</p>
<p>up all right my fourth point look at how you handle yourself when you&rsquo;re upset do</p>
<p>you get annoyed when you&rsquo;re upset are you mean to yourself when you&rsquo;re upset</p>
<p>are you gentle with yourself when you&rsquo;re upset like how do you respond when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>upset do you look at it like it&rsquo;s annoying do you look at it like it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>bother like the fact that you&rsquo;re upset right now it&rsquo;s like oh god damn it like</p>
<p>can you just fucking not like is that how you respond to yourself because</p>
<p>someone that loves herself doesn&rsquo;t do that like I said with prioritizing the</p>
<p>way that you feel people that love their selves are understanding when they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>upset they understand why they&rsquo;re upset they understand that it&rsquo;s okay to feel</p>
<p>upset they understand given what we just went through if you&rsquo;re upset and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re crying right now that&rsquo;s understandable someone that loves</p>
<p>herself is gonna validate the way that they feel not fight it or criticize it</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna try to understand what led us to feeling this way you know and I</p>
<p>keep saying us because I look at myself like two people sometimes I have to so I</p>
<p>can like properly caretake myself but are you reassuring to yourself are you</p>
<p>sweet to yourself when you&rsquo;re upset when you&rsquo;re sad when you&rsquo;re even fucking</p>
<p>angry like are you able to self-soothe are you able to be there for you</p>
<p>emotionally like do you hold your own hand do you give yourself encouragement</p>
<p>and another reason that I look at myself like two different people is because</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s like an observer self and then there&rsquo;s part of you that is upset so the</p>
<p>part of you that is upset when it&rsquo;s upset it&rsquo;s crying it&rsquo;s whatever it wants</p>
<p>your presence it needs your presence it needs you to sit there with it do you</p>
<p>abandon yourself when you&rsquo;re upset or do you give yourself your attention that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s really going on that&rsquo;s what really needs to happen is you need to be</p>
<p>present with the part of you that is upset you don&rsquo;t need to discard it you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t need to beat it up you don&rsquo;t need to look at it like it&rsquo;s fucking annoying</p>
<p>even though it might be in a bad time it that part of you still needs your</p>
<p>attention it still needs you to be there with it and if you truly love yourself</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t matter when it&rsquo;s upset you&rsquo;re still gonna care that it&rsquo;s upset and be</p>
<p>there for it that part of you which is you think about if you were there for</p>
<p>like the person that you love the most if you were in like a really important</p>
<p>moment and that person just got really upset you would be there for them like</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t matter what you have going on when you genuinely love someone and care</p>
<p>for someone you prioritize how they feel you care about how they feel and if</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re upset you&rsquo;re not okay so you the you being present with them and you</p>
<p>being there for them when they&rsquo;re upset is what makes you feel better because</p>
<p>someone that you genuinely love cannot be upset and you just sit there and be</p>
<p>okay that&rsquo;s detachment if someone that you truly love is like heartbroken</p>
<p>upset and you can just look the other way or you can be annoyed by it you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t actually love them you don&rsquo;t actually care about them you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>taking them as part of yourself and that&rsquo;s what love is because if I truly</p>
<p>love you you can&rsquo;t be upset and me just be okay with it I can&rsquo;t just go on my</p>
<p>merry way and know that you&rsquo;re like breaking down and you&rsquo;re really upset</p>
<p>you know that&rsquo;s not love that&rsquo;s disconnect because like I said I</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t be able to do that if I saw you as part of me that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m very picky</p>
<p>with when people say that they love me like I let people say it but if I tell</p>
<p>someone I love them that&rsquo;s some deep fucking shit and that&rsquo;s very important</p>
<p>to me I don&rsquo;t like people&rsquo;s definition of love because people mislabel love a</p>
<p>lot they think that it&rsquo;s like this just intense feeling that they have towards</p>
<p>someone like oh my god I love you it&rsquo;s like no that&rsquo;s not it if I genuinely</p>
<p>tell someone I love you I take you as part of me your best interests</p>
<p>everything about you is now part of me and it&rsquo;s important to me me making sure</p>
<p>you get what you want me making sure you&rsquo;re okay the way that you feel what</p>
<p>makes you happy all of that is now right there next to everything about me I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna prioritize us both that&rsquo;s what I mean when I say I love you because the</p>
<p>people that want to run around and just label that feeling that they have as</p>
<p>like they have like this really strong appreciation towards you they want to</p>
<p>label that as oh my god I love you they&rsquo;re the same people that can cause</p>
<p>you in a serious amount of pain and sit there and watch you cry and just look at</p>
<p>you and just wonder why you&rsquo;re crying because they&rsquo;re disconnected that&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>love I don&rsquo;t let people say they love me if they do fucked up shit like you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t get to say that you fucking love me if you&rsquo;re able to do this you know</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t get to go hurt me like this and then say you love me eat a fucking</p>
<p>dick but anyway I think you get my point with number four number five when</p>
<p>it comes to your best interests and your goals do you make decisions in line with</p>
<p>these so do you prioritize your goals do you prioritize what&rsquo;s in your best</p>
<p>interest do you take into consideration what&rsquo;s best for you do you act in that</p>
<p>way so like with your goals if you have a goal say let&rsquo;s you you want to go to</p>
<p>the gym and you want to eat healthy and you want to eat clean when someone</p>
<p>invites you to go out on Friday night do you throw away your goals do you throw</p>
<p>away eating clean and going to the gym on Friday night for going out and</p>
<p>drinking alcohol or do you make the decision to do what you said you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna do and go and do what&rsquo;s in line with your goal you know which one seems</p>
<p>more self-loving and I&rsquo;m not saying going out and drinking is bad I&rsquo;m saying</p>
<p>you need to prioritize your goals and what&rsquo;s in your best interests first so</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re gonna go out and go drink go to the fucking gym before eat clean all</p>
<p>day maybe do a little extra cardio so that you can have extra calories to</p>
<p>spare so when you go drink you&rsquo;re not like throwing off your goals like you</p>
<p>can do both you can have a balance but don&rsquo;t just throw away your goals and</p>
<p>throw away what you want because you want to go do something else that&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>self-loving there&rsquo;s a way to do both like I just said but someone who loves</p>
<p>their self is gonna make sure they get what they want and if they&rsquo;re working</p>
<p>toward a goal the loving thing to do is stay accountable with that goal you set</p>
<p>that goal for a reason it&rsquo;s because it gets you to something that you want are</p>
<p>you gonna prioritize getting what you want or you&rsquo;re gonna prioritize oh I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna go run out and have fun with my friends real quick no that&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>self-loving I told you guys this self-love shit is a lot different than</p>
<p>you think it&rsquo;s not as easy as people make it seem and it&rsquo;s a lot more complex</p>
<p>like just little shit like this like people don&rsquo;t think of it this way but it</p>
<p>is all these things okay so number six this one&rsquo;s about the way you let people</p>
<p>treat you and speak to you someone who loves their self is not gonna allow</p>
<p>their self to be disrespected repeatedly by the same person without saying</p>
<p>something they&rsquo;re not just gonna sit back and let their self be bullied or</p>
<p>disrespected or not considered someone who loves their self is gonna stand the</p>
<p>fuck up take their self into consideration and not deal with that</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna choose better for their self they&rsquo;re not gonna be around people</p>
<p>that make them feel like shit or that treat them like shit or that put them</p>
<p>second and don&rsquo;t consider them and that discard them and the way that they feel</p>
<p>someone who loves their self is gonna want better for their self they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>just gonna make their self endure it and deal with it and put up with it you can</p>
<p>always find a way to justify it and to make it seem okay to yourself to stay in</p>
<p>a place where you get disrespected say it&rsquo;s a job oh well my boss disrespects</p>
<p>me and treats me like fucking shit and I don&rsquo;t make piss for money but I have to</p>
<p>stay in this job because I have bills to pay babe you can easily go get another</p>
<p>fucking job you can get out of that shit like I said you can justify it it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>with your partner like you can tell yourself all the reasons why you</p>
<p>shouldn&rsquo;t leave them and why them disrespecting you is okay you just have</p>
<p>to put up with it but that&rsquo;s not self-loving the self-loving action is to</p>
<p>get the fuck out of there the self-loving action is to prioritize the</p>
<p>way that you feel and make it important and get out of a damaging environment</p>
<p>you wouldn&rsquo;t tell a five-year-old to stay in that you wouldn&rsquo;t tell a</p>
<p>five-year-old that they need to just put up with being treated like fucking shit</p>
<p>so don&rsquo;t tell yourself that all right number seven this one comes to like</p>
<p>health and eating habits and shit like how do you treat your body okay do you</p>
<p>act like you care about it the way that you eat the way that you exercise the</p>
<p>way that you treat your body do you act like and treat your body like you care</p>
<p>about it and I&rsquo;m not saying you have to eat fucking perfect all the time</p>
<p>everybody binges everybody has a bad fucking day everybody eats a little ice</p>
<p>cream or a cheesecake or whatever the fuck they want it&rsquo;s not wrong to have</p>
<p>these things you don&rsquo;t have to eat like a perfect diet all the time you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have to work out every single fucking day but for the most of it do you take</p>
<p>into consideration the health of your body do you treat your body like you</p>
<p>love it like you care about it do you care about the well-being of your body</p>
<p>and number eight kind of tags off that so that one is more about sex and</p>
<p>people&rsquo;s habits for sex someone that loves their self is gonna be aware of</p>
<p>and take into consideration that by having sex with another human being</p>
<p>there is a potential to catch an STD STDs are a real fucking thing they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>rampant and they&rsquo;re very prevalent and they&rsquo;re a lot more common than you</p>
<p>realize but looking out for your health and watching out for yourself and making</p>
<p>sure that someone you&rsquo;re about to hook up with is clean is important and a lot</p>
<p>of people get mad and like get defensive if you ask their status and if you ask</p>
<p>what STDs they have motherfucker get mad if you want to but you&rsquo;re entitled to</p>
<p>protect yourself like I will never hook up with someone that has a negative</p>
<p>reaction to me asking their result one and I will never hook up with someone</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t also ask my results before we hook up like I need someone that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just as paranoid as I fucking am because I don&rsquo;t have nothing and I don&rsquo;t plan on</p>
<p>catching nothing well nobody does you know but being cautious is the thing</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;m paranoid I take it to a new fucking extreme but being cautious being</p>
<p>preventative and protecting yourself and your sexual integrity and your sexual</p>
<p>health like that&rsquo;s a big fucking thing that&rsquo;s something that is not very</p>
<p>on-trend anymore like people try not to hurt people&rsquo;s feelings and I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>why all of a sudden it&rsquo;s offensive to ask someone if they have an STD that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>their fucking issue to deal with if they&rsquo;re offended by it you ask ask</p>
<p>anyone before you hook up with them and make sure that they&rsquo;re disclosing if</p>
<p>they do have anything so that you can protect yourself like you deserve that</p>
<p>and anyone that loves their self is gonna do that they&rsquo;re gonna take that</p>
<p>into consideration they&rsquo;re gonna put their self and their health above</p>
<p>potentially hurting someone&rsquo;s fucking feelings by asking them a are you about</p>
<p>to transmit something to me this is a very touchy topic but it is a huge one</p>
<p>that I felt like I needed to include for the self-love thing because hookup</p>
<p>culture and sex is like no big deal and people are so run by it it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>pathetic and I don&rsquo;t get it I don&rsquo;t relate to that there&rsquo;s instances where I</p>
<p>can relate to it we&rsquo;ve all had a ho phase you know we&rsquo;ve all fucking slutted</p>
<p>it up but I just don&rsquo;t get the whole like disregard for your own health</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s something I really don&rsquo;t understand I&rsquo;ve always been very</p>
<p>paranoid I&rsquo;ve always been very cautious I have had people lie to me about shit</p>
<p>before and they got their motherfucking asses beat but luckily I didn&rsquo;t catch</p>
<p>anything they caught a beating I caught nothing I&rsquo;m glad about that like I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>happy and I&rsquo;m fucking relieved that I haven&rsquo;t contracted anything but that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>something people tend to forget like they forget that STDs are a thing and</p>
<p>everyone&rsquo;s like oh it&rsquo;s not gonna happen to me but it&rsquo;s like bitch it can and</p>
<p>someone that loves their self is not even gonna leave that shit up to chance</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna take steps to make sure that they&rsquo;re okay there&rsquo;s no way to</p>
<p>fully ever know like if you take a motherfucker to the clinic before you</p>
<p>have sex with them and you get them tested sure get a blood test if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>ever gonna do that get a blood test but there&rsquo;s no way you can like actually</p>
<p>fully be sure you know and I get that and I&rsquo;m not saying you have to take</p>
<p>everyone to the fucking clinic but do take steps to reassure yourself and kind</p>
<p>of put your mind at ease that you&rsquo;re like putting effort into making sure</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re safe because that&rsquo;s the loving action to make sure you&rsquo;re okay</p>
<p>to try and protect yourself as much as you can even though you can never fully</p>
<p>like a hundred percent know that nothing&rsquo;s gonna happen like it&rsquo;s always</p>
<p>a risk it&rsquo;s always taking a chance when you have sex or hook up with anyone so</p>
<p>just taking a couple preventative actions and taking a couple like safety</p>
<p>measures and precautions that&rsquo;s self-loving and before anyone gets</p>
<p>offended about what I just said refucking listen to what I just said and</p>
<p>check yourself because I didn&rsquo;t say shit that was offensive I didn&rsquo;t accuse</p>
<p>anybody don&rsquo;t fucking try it come at me saying people that have contracted</p>
<p>things don&rsquo;t love their self no bitch that&rsquo;s not what the fuck I&rsquo;m saying</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t even try it not with me so even if it doesn&rsquo;t seem like it&rsquo;s cool or even</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re scared to hurt their feelings I&rsquo;m reassuring you right now you are</p>
<p>fully fucking justified and entitled to know the status of your partner before</p>
<p>you fuck them ask for their paperwork ask when the last time is they were</p>
<p>tested and asked to see the fucking results like asked to see it don&rsquo;t be</p>
<p>shy like fucking do that for yourself you owe that to yourself okay number</p>
<p>nine spending and money okay your budget do you have a budget are you reckless</p>
<p>with your spending habits do you take into consideration the potential</p>
<p>consequences of spending too much money like are you are you just like carefree</p>
<p>just spending whatever the fuck and not caring what happens are you worried</p>
<p>about putting yourself in debt do you take it into consideration do you have</p>
<p>something set up where you know you&rsquo;re not gonna be in a financial bind which</p>
<p>is a budget you know like do you have like safety money put away do you buy</p>
<p>stupid ass fucking shit you don&rsquo;t need are you looking out for yourself</p>
<p>financially basically because that&rsquo;s a self-loving thing to do because fucking</p>
<p>yourself up financially can fuck you up in many aspects of life so that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>something to definitely take into consideration that most people don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think about but yeah having a budget and watching your spending is a</p>
<p>self-loving thing to do because it&rsquo;s preventing a like a future consequence</p>
<p>of like something negative happening you know like you&rsquo;re looking out for</p>
<p>yourself all right number ten do you make sure</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re taken care of this is just the basic one of like do you make sure</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re taken into consideration do you make sure you&rsquo;re prioritized do you make</p>
<p>sure that you&rsquo;re comfortable do you make that important to you and I&rsquo;m talking</p>
<p>about all kind of shit so do you make sure that you&rsquo;ve eaten do you make sure</p>
<p>that you have food do you make sure that you&rsquo;re clean do you make sure that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re taken care of in like any aspect you can think of if you pay for</p>
<p>something do you make sure that you get what you pay for or are you just gonna be</p>
<p>like I fuck it if it&rsquo;s wrong and just deal with it no you need to make sure</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re getting what you paid for you need to make sure you&rsquo;re taken into</p>
<p>consideration and that you&rsquo;re taken care of that&rsquo;s a really fucking big one okay</p>
<p>number 11 y&rsquo;all might get mad at this one too but do you do what you tell</p>
<p>yourself you&rsquo;re going to do are you able to rely on yourself can you trust the</p>
<p>words that come out of your fucking mouth when you tell yourself okay I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna do XYZ do you do it do you actually follow through with what you</p>
<p>say you&rsquo;re gonna do do you keep your word to yourself keeping your word is</p>
<p>something that is so much more important than people even fucking realize and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so much bigger of a component to self-trust than people even know so do</p>
<p>you do what needs to be done do you push yourself do you hold yourself</p>
<p>accountable do you do what you say you&rsquo;re gonna fucking do that&rsquo;s it</p>
<p>because someone who loves their self would and the self-loving thing to do is</p>
<p>be a person you can rely on for yourself and part of that is doing what you tell</p>
<p>yourself you&rsquo;re gonna do which is fucking hard sometimes it&rsquo;s really hard</p>
<p>especially when you don&rsquo;t feel like it it&rsquo;s if you say you&rsquo;re gonna set a goal</p>
<p>of like okay I&rsquo;m gonna go to the gym for like five days this week are you</p>
<p>actually gonna go do you push yourself to go do you push yourself to do what</p>
<p>you said you&rsquo;re gonna do do you push yourself to meet your goals even when</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t feel like it you&rsquo;re not always gonna fucking feel like it but are you</p>
<p>able to rely on yourself even when you don&rsquo;t feel like it are you still gonna</p>
<p>push yourself are you still gonna be there for yourself and do it anyways</p>
<p>all right number 12 and this one is the biggest one of them all do you hide the</p>
<p>truth about yourself because that is the opposite of loving yourself there&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>many things I can talk about when it comes to that but basically being</p>
<p>authentic do you hide anything about yourself you&rsquo;re sending yourself the</p>
<p>message that something about you is bad and wrong and is embarrassing and that</p>
<p>it should be hidden that&rsquo;s not a loving way to focus towards yourself toward any</p>
<p>part of yourself and I had to deal with this when I finally came out and stopped</p>
<p>hiding that I was gay that happened because of this whole self-loving</p>
<p>journey shit ah it&rsquo;s so frustrating but that&rsquo;s something that happened as the</p>
<p>result of this because you can&rsquo;t say you love yourself and be like oh I love</p>
<p>myself me and be hiding yourself at the same time it&rsquo;s a contradiction you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>tell yourself something is bad and wrong about you and feel good about yourself</p>
<p>at the same time any part of you that you feel like you need to hide whether</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the vulnerable part of you that&rsquo;s sad or the part of you that&rsquo;s scared or</p>
<p>the party that actually doesn&rsquo;t like something or the part of you that does</p>
<p>actually like something all these parts of you are parts of you and there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>nothing wrong with them and they don&rsquo;t need to be hidden like I said turn</p>
<p>toward the attitude of understanding it try to understand why it is the way that</p>
<p>it is try to find a way to accept the way that it is and notice I didn&rsquo;t say</p>
<p>find approval for it because that&rsquo;s the next step you first need to accept the</p>
<p>part of you that is what it is or is how it is you need to accept that it is that</p>
<p>way or it is that thing you need to just accept the truth of it first it is</p>
<p>that way not trying to change it not trying to anything just look at it and</p>
<p>find a way to fucking accept it it is what it is it is a part of you then you</p>
<p>can move into the whole like process of approving of it and that&rsquo;s a whole</p>
<p>different fucking bag of worms I don&rsquo;t want to open cantaloupes bag of worms</p>
<p>bitch I&rsquo;m thinking of gummy worms but yes the most loving action you can take</p>
<p>is to stop hiding parts of yourself is to bring the truth of yourself and who</p>
<p>you are to the front and showing it and sharing it with people it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>self-loving to hide any part of you so I&rsquo;m gonna end this podcast off on that I</p>
<p>hope this episode was helpful because everyone was fucking on my ass about the</p>
<p>self-love self-love self only okay here it is</p>
<p>send me your thoughts on Instagram I&rsquo;ll have my DMS open so you guys can message</p>
<p>me whatever you want I really want to know what you think of this episode my</p>
<p>Instagram is Leo the elbow I&rsquo;ll put it in the description of this podcast so</p>
<p>you can look it up I&rsquo;ll also put my tick tocks and all my other shit and my app</p>
<p>too if you want to download my app it&rsquo;s called positive focus but definitely</p>
<p>send me you guys&rsquo;s opinion on this episode because this is what I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>learned this is some of the shit that I&rsquo;ve had work for me because I&rsquo;ve tried</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve read over 50 self-help books okay and I still didn&rsquo;t fucking know what to</p>
<p>do after them and this is the shit that I came up with this is the shit that I</p>
<p>just had to learn from experience and like just figuring it out on my own</p>
<p>because everything else has fucking failed me that&rsquo;s really what this</p>
<p>podcast is is me sharing what I&rsquo;ve learned because nothing else goddamn</p>
<p>works so hope it was helpful hope you could take something from it and I hope</p>
<p>this inspires you to start taking more self-loving actions and stop beating</p>
<p>yourself up because you don&rsquo;t air quote love yourself like bitch it&rsquo;s a process</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a fucking way of life it&rsquo;s not a goddamn thing you just feel or don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>feel so thank you for listening if you made it this far I love you all to death</p>
<p>and I will talk to you next Sunday</p>
