    <p>The following is a conversation with RZA.</p>
<p>The rapper, record producer, filmmaker, actor, writer,</p>
<p>philosopher, Kung Fu scholar, and the mastermind</p>
<p>of the legendary hip hop group Wu Tang Clan.</p>
<p>This is the Lex Friedman podcast.</p>
<p>To support it, please check out our sponsors</p>
<p>in the description.</p>
<p>And now, here&rsquo;s my conversation with RZA.</p>
<p>In the Tao of Wu, you write,</p>
<p>when my mother left the physical world, I lost one</p>
<p>of my main links to the universe.</p>
<p>They say that you have an umbilical cord</p>
<p>and an etheric cord, which is the invisible cord</p>
<p>that attaches you to your soul, your mother&rsquo;s soul</p>
<p>and all other souls.</p>
<p>When one passes away, you really lose something.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s physical and mental.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s real.</p>
<p>Part of you dies.</p>
<p>What have you learned about life from your mother?</p>
<p>I mean, I learned life itself from my mother.</p>
<p>You know, being one of 11 children</p>
<p>and seeing the sacrifice that she gave to us,</p>
<p>therefore given to life.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really the greatest lesson of life.</p>
<p>The thing that shook me as I wrote those words</p>
<p>was coming up young with arrogance, confidence,</p>
<p>knowledge of myself.</p>
<p>They called me the scientist.</p>
<p>We was taught you&rsquo;re the supreme being.</p>
<p>In order to be the supreme being,</p>
<p>you gotta be supreme amongst other beings.</p>
<p>I understand that more now than I did then</p>
<p>because then it was so literal.</p>
<p>You know, the word God derived basically</p>
<p>from the Greek language, as they say,</p>
<p>and it meant wisdom, strength and beauty.</p>
<p>Yeah, we could have that.</p>
<p>But the power to control life and death</p>
<p>is something that you would assume is a God trait.</p>
<p>So now here you are saying that you&rsquo;re a God, right?</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re reading the Bible,</p>
<p>how Jesus brought back Lazarus.</p>
<p>And you know, now it&rsquo;s your turn to do something.</p>
<p>And when my mother was laying there in the hospital bed</p>
<p>and air was no longer coming out of her lungs</p>
<p>and going into her lungs,</p>
<p>where&rsquo;s my power to bring her back to life?</p>
<p>Yeah, so you can&rsquo;t truly be God.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re powerless.</p>
<p>Yeah, or God is not the definition</p>
<p>that we need to use to describe it</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a translation of wisdom, strength and beauty.</p>
<p>So you could be that.</p>
<p>But so I&rsquo;m answering your question,</p>
<p>what did my mother teach me about life?</p>
<p>I learned that day on her physical passing,</p>
<p>that okay, you know what I mean, there&rsquo;s a physical me.</p>
<p>Do you think about her, do you miss her?</p>
<p>Of course, I keep my mother in my prayer every day.</p>
<p>And the thing I pray the most beyond giving thanks</p>
<p>is I pray that her name is honored</p>
<p>and remembered by my family.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if the world&rsquo;s gonna remember that, right?</p>
<p>Even though if you watch my movie, Love Beats Rhymes,</p>
<p>I named the school in that movie after my mother</p>
<p>just to leave it somewhere else.</p>
<p>Yeah, in physical space.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>But yeah, painful.</p>
<p>The pain of my mother&rsquo;s passing is indescribable.</p>
<p>Only until it happens to a person they know</p>
<p>and then they won&rsquo;t describe it either.</p>
<p>Only the people that lost their mother,</p>
<p>they could look at each other and they got this nod.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>But one other thing happened to me was the joy of life</p>
<p>hit me differently.</p>
<p>And I think it was the realization of my own mortality</p>
<p>versus my immortality.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a big, big thing.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know if we&rsquo;ll get to expound on that,</p>
<p>but there was a joy that overcame me</p>
<p>because I was kind of free of a certain illusion</p>
<p>about the immortality of my physical being</p>
<p>versus the mortality of my physical being.</p>
<p>And I was like, okay, wow, I understand.</p>
<p>So that was the first or the hardest realization</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve experienced that you&rsquo;re mortal.</p>
<p>Yeah, that, yeah.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll say mortal and what you&rsquo;re looking at here</p>
<p>physically, I won&rsquo;t say my soul is mortal.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll say it&rsquo;s immortal because at the end of the day,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just like I can sit here and I could just hum,</p>
<p>please, please, please, by James Brown.</p>
<p>But James Brown is not gonna come in here and do that.</p>
<p>So in some sense, James Brown is still here.</p>
<p>In another sense, he&rsquo;s gone.</p>
<p>His soul is here.</p>
<p>Well, it lives through you by you singing it.</p>
<p>It lives through you by you listening to it, celebrating it.</p>
<p>And the hope is that the human species continues</p>
<p>to celebrate the great minds</p>
<p>and the great creations of the past.</p>
<p>I will add this to that equation.</p>
<p>When I say it&rsquo;s immortal,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s not just only</p>
<p>because somebody sings it, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, where&rsquo;s the fire at right now?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s in the air.</p>
<p>You just gotta spark the spark.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s always there.</p>
<p>Are you afraid of death?</p>
<p>Nah, I&rsquo;m not afraid of death.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not trying to see it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not watching that nowhere near me, right?</p>
<p>Because all I know is life, right?</p>
<p>My life is living.</p>
<p>I read a lot of ancient texts,</p>
<p>people probably know about me.</p>
<p>I love one of the great teachers named Bodhidharma.</p>
<p>And there was a thing written in one of the books of his</p>
<p>or one of the teachings of his.</p>
<p>And the question, somebody asked him similar question,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re scared of death or what are you gonna be</p>
<p>after you die?</p>
<p>And his answer was, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>He had answers to everything.</p>
<p>But he was like, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>They said, oh, he doesn&rsquo;t know that.</p>
<p>So yeah, because I haven&rsquo;t died yet.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, the uncertainty to some people is terrifying.</p>
<p>Not knowing what&rsquo;s on the other side of the door.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, especially when you&rsquo;re young.</p>
<p>You know, as a kid, fear permeated my life.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>You know, I was actually watching horror movies</p>
<p>and I believed in all type of supernatural things</p>
<p>that could or can happen.</p>
<p>I thought I saw things as well.</p>
<p>And you know, whether it was being projected</p>
<p>in my own mind or whether it was there visible to me,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, right?</p>
<p>But life is beautiful and we have it.</p>
<p>And we should use it all the way to the last drop.</p>
<p>Realizing the mortality, the gift your mother gave to you</p>
<p>is realizing the immortal.</p>
<p>And in so doing, help you realize that life is beautiful.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>On this topic, Quincy Jones, I read, said to ODB and you,</p>
<p>when it rains, get wet.</p>
<p>What do these words mean to you?</p>
<p>Well, I think what Quincy was saying at that time was,</p>
<p>you know, I think I was more conservative,</p>
<p>like as a person.</p>
<p>And like, you know, I had money.</p>
<p>Women wanted me.</p>
<p>Anything I kind of wanted, I probably could have had.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>And he was just saying, when it rains, get wet.</p>
<p>Enjoy this, man.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s raining on you.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t put up the umbrella.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t go back in the house.</p>
<p>Get wet.</p>
<p>Experience the moment.</p>
<p>Yeah, and enjoy it.</p>
<p>And I didn&rsquo;t take total heed to him at that time.</p>
<p>A couple of years later, I took some heed.</p>
<p>But at that time, I didn&rsquo;t take heed.</p>
<p>And when I took heed,</p>
<p>I think that I may have misinterpreted</p>
<p>by looking at his example of getting wet</p>
<p>versus my example of getting wet.</p>
<p>And I can tell you right now,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m getting wet right now in my way.</p>
<p>In part, thanks to your mother.</p>
<p>But overall, you just learned how to appreciate the rain,</p>
<p>just like the experience of every moment.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I&rsquo;ll share this with you</p>
<p>because this is going to be a very open conversation</p>
<p>and I haven&rsquo;t had this conversation.</p>
<p>So definitely in part to my mother,</p>
<p>then in part to my wife.</p>
<p>I meet my wife, it&rsquo;s my second wife,</p>
<p>but I met her after my mother passed.</p>
<p>And she was just a friend.</p>
<p>You know, some girl I met, I thought she was beautiful</p>
<p>and actually built a friendship with her.</p>
<p>But a few years later, when the relationship became like,</p>
<p>you know, this is going to be my woman,</p>
<p>it was actually when I was doing the middle of my divorce</p>
<p>and I was like, you know, do I run wild and hey, hey, hey,</p>
<p>you know, me and my wife already filed, we were separated.</p>
<p>And do I run wild?</p>
<p>And I didn&rsquo;t run wild, a little bit, but not too wild.</p>
<p>And you know, I&rsquo;m still a man, I&rsquo;m a hip hop guy, so.</p>
<p>I read you know how to party.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>But the funny thing is that my wife now, her name is Talani,</p>
<p>my uncle said, she reminds me of your mother.</p>
<p>He knew my mother before I knew my mother.</p>
<p>And he saw that and we ended up dating, got engaged</p>
<p>and then her mother passes.</p>
<p>And so now there&rsquo;s a total understanding of everything.</p>
<p>And we actually help build each other back up.</p>
<p>So of course I have to thank my mother for the awareness.</p>
<p>Then I thank my wife for bringing that awareness</p>
<p>to actual actualization, like to actually feel,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll be talking to you right now</p>
<p>and talking as much as I do these days,</p>
<p>if it wasn&rsquo;t for the security and peace and harmony</p>
<p>that I was able to gain at home, you know, so.</p>
<p>And like you said, you now share that look</p>
<p>of having both lost your, your mom.</p>
<p>What have you learned from Quincy about music,</p>
<p>about business, about life?</p>
<p>Quincy Jones is a great mind, great artist, you know,</p>
<p>a treasure in all reality.</p>
<p>He seen it from when it was, he couldn&rsquo;t walk in this,</p>
<p>he couldn&rsquo;t eat in the same places he played his music at</p>
<p>to owning places bigger than ours.</p>
<p>So what a beautiful life, you know?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the type of guy, if you spend one hour with him,</p>
<p>you got a lifetime of information.</p>
<p>And I was blessed to spend multiple hours with him</p>
<p>and days with him.</p>
<p>And, you know, there&rsquo;s a certain period of time</p>
<p>where we came across each other and he was always</p>
<p>there to share the knowledge.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s another thing about him that I think is special.</p>
<p>And hopefully I picked that up,</p>
<p>is that he&rsquo;s always willing to share,</p>
<p>share with his experience, his knowledge.</p>
<p>I mean, I think he&rsquo;ll even share his home</p>
<p>to the right person if he feels that that&rsquo;s what they need</p>
<p>to get back on their feet.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a very beautiful man.</p>
<p>So just the kindness, the goodness of the man</p>
<p>is like the thing that really rubbed off on you.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, minimum, right?</p>
<p>I mean, Quincy Jones also in his fifties,</p>
<p>as a producer, produced one of the greatest albums</p>
<p>of all time and one of the greatest selling albums</p>
<p>of all time.</p>
<p>Not just great critically, economically great.</p>
<p>And I mean, I think he did it at the age I am right now.</p>
<p>So I might have a great year coming up.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Time and well, yeah.</p>
<p>So now you got a taste of what greatness is.</p>
<p>You get to see what greatness is.</p>
<p>So you know what you need to do for yourself.</p>
<p>Exactly, how to strive for yourself, yeah.</p>
<p>You have a few people you&rsquo;ve worked with</p>
<p>who are fascinating like yourself.</p>
<p>Quentin Tarantino, you worked with him.</p>
<p>When somebody asked you to describe him with one word,</p>
<p>you said encyclopedia.</p>
<p>What have you learned from the guy</p>
<p>about filmmaking and about life again?</p>
<p>A very generous man with his knowledge.</p>
<p>And for me, he shared it, I think,</p>
<p>in a way that was unique in a sense of,</p>
<p>you know, at a point in time,</p>
<p>you know, we just was super duper tight.</p>
<p>Like, you know, like I&rsquo;m going to this crib</p>
<p>and watching movies and just having long conversations</p>
<p>about art and about life.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>So I learned a lot.</p>
<p>I consider him, you know,</p>
<p>especially when it comes to anything cinematic in my life,</p>
<p>I consider him the godfather of that for me.</p>
<p>I think, you know, I humbly asked him to mentor me,</p>
<p>which is a very humbling thing to do</p>
<p>coming from my neighborhood, coming from who I am,</p>
<p>coming from, I was already a multi platinum artist,</p>
<p>you know, I mean, it was a year,</p>
<p>it was past the year 2000 already.</p>
<p>So like 2001, 2002 that I asked him to mentor me.</p>
<p>So I was the wizard already, you know what I mean?</p>
<p>But I humbled myself because I saw in him</p>
<p>a craft of brain power that to me resonated with me,</p>
<p>but I was just a Patamon at it, I was a novice at it</p>
<p>because I was trying to make movies in my music,</p>
<p>you know, trying to make videos.</p>
<p>And here was a man who was a master of it</p>
<p>and an encyclopedia of it as well.</p>
<p>Like film history.</p>
<p>Film history from whether it&rsquo;s the actor,</p>
<p>the director, the cinematographer,</p>
<p>maybe even the costume designer.</p>
<p>He may know 50, 60,</p>
<p>he may know the 50 greatest costume designers</p>
<p>in his memory.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, it&rsquo;s a guy&rsquo;s brain.</p>
<p>Both of you have pretty good memory.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to be a fly on the wall of that conversation.</p>
<p>And kung fu movies, most of you guys want.</p>
<p>We actually started,</p>
<p>I think we started our relationship</p>
<p>trying to outdo each other.</p>
<p>Knowledge wise or what?</p>
<p>Yeah, movie knowledge wise.</p>
<p>Actually kung fu movie knowledge wise.</p>
<p>And I think that, if it wasn&rsquo;t another category,</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t have had a chance,</p>
<p>but at least in that category,</p>
<p>I was pretty holding my weight.</p>
<p>For one.</p>
<p>You know what?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be honest and say that I may have said a few,</p>
<p>he didn&rsquo;t see, but Quentin is older than me.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So he could go back.</p>
<p>Farther.</p>
<p>Yeah, he could go back to 72</p>
<p>when I didn&rsquo;t see one yet.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, he said Master of the Flying Gate Team</p>
<p>that I got a chance to,</p>
<p>that you commentated over today</p>
<p>and I got a chance to see the screening of.</p>
<p>He said that&rsquo;s one of his favorites.</p>
<p>For you, the 36 Chamber of Shaolin,</p>
<p>the Master Killer is your favorite.</p>
<p>Best ever, would you say?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the greatest Kung Fu movie ever?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to say the greatest ever, right?</p>
<p>Because somebody may make another one</p>
<p>and it depends on your own phase of life.</p>
<p>But I will put that first.</p>
<p>If I want to introduce somebody to Kung Fu movies,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a beautiful entry.</p>
<p>You talk about knowledge, you talk about wisdom.</p>
<p>What kind of wisdom do you draw from Kung Fu movies?</p>
<p>The, you know what?</p>
<p>The martial art itself and the movies.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s endless wisdom to be drawn and I draw it, you know?</p>
<p>I draw it in a way, you know,</p>
<p>that I could decipher it in my own life.</p>
<p>So for instance, in the movie, Master Killer,</p>
<p>he basically, when he does Kung Fu,</p>
<p>he does it really a style called the Hung Ga technique.</p>
<p>And the director of the movie</p>
<p>is actually a Hung Ga expert who has a lineage</p>
<p>that traces all the way back to Shaolin Temple.</p>
<p>And this director always wanted to keep his movies pure</p>
<p>and to bring Hung Ga to the world.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like he wanted to show the world this lineage.</p>
<p>In fact, you just said Master of the Flying Guillotine</p>
<p>is Quentin&rsquo;s favorite movie.</p>
<p>And we mentioned that 36 Chambers is my favorite movie,</p>
<p>but the action director of Master of Flying Guillotine</p>
<p>is the director of 36 Chambers of Shaolin.</p>
<p>And some of the things that&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>in Master of the Flying Guillotine</p>
<p>is really the infant stage</p>
<p>of what this action director is going to learn</p>
<p>and then use later on in his movies.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the beauty of it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like, you know,</p>
<p>Quentin is seeing him in his generation.</p>
<p>So Quentin might have been the same age I was</p>
<p>watching that movie.</p>
<p>And then when he becomes a director,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m at Quentin&rsquo;s age and now I&rsquo;m seeing his work.</p>
<p>So some symbionic relationship there.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll end this question by saying,</p>
<p>Hung Ga deals with the five animal technique,</p>
<p>the tiger, the crane, the leopard, the snake, and a dragon.</p>
<p>Those are the five, that&rsquo;s the five pattern.</p>
<p>Some people go seven, some go 12,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a stick to the five pattern fist.</p>
<p>How do a man emulate a tiger?</p>
<p>And you see a tiger&rsquo;s fists.</p>
<p>He curls before he spawns on you.</p>
<p>How does a man emulate a snake?</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t have to be only in the Kung Fu move.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s in the ideology of the snake.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s in the agility of the crane.</p>
<p>At any moment, sometimes punching a person</p>
<p>is not going to work,</p>
<p>as they would say in leopard fist or tiger paw.</p>
<p>So sometimes you might have to poke them in the eye</p>
<p>with the crane&rsquo;s beak.</p>
<p>So having your mind able to adapt the instinct</p>
<p>of the animal when you are being attacked</p>
<p>or when you are being the aggressor,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s something that you don&rsquo;t need a form for.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the mentality.</p>
<p>So Kung Fu, like I said, it informs me endlessly</p>
<p>because at first I was trying to learn how to hold my,</p>
<p>like, I can&rsquo;t really hit you with that</p>
<p>and really hurt you unless I&rsquo;ve been banging my hand</p>
<p>a thousand times on some bricks</p>
<p>and made it so callous or muscles are so strong.</p>
<p>But the idea that if me and you was to get into a fight</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m going to tiger up on you and take that instinct</p>
<p>and prance when I&rsquo;m a prance,</p>
<p>or fly away like the stork, you know what I mean?</p>
<p>Like, yo, that&rsquo;s the mentality.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s much more than the technical moves.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s much deeper.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>I mean, when I see the Kung Fu movies,</p>
<p>because I love martial arts, all martial arts,</p>
<p>and competitive ones too,</p>
<p>like the actual competitions and so on.</p>
<p>It just seems like Kung Fu movies go much deeper</p>
<p>than just like the techniques.</p>
<p>Yeah, they start, I mean, if you see it, right,</p>
<p>even I watched the great MMA fight recently,</p>
<p>just interesting because he was on top of the guy,</p>
<p>and the way he got from under him,</p>
<p>it had to be his spirit got from under him.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s some like mixture of crane and whatever.</p>
<p>Snake, ill, with the slippery ill technique.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>No, I love that when people become artists in the cage</p>
<p>or that&rsquo;s much bigger than just like winning,</p>
<p>much bigger than particular techniques.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just art, especially at the highest level competition</p>
<p>where millions of people are watching.</p>
<p>Which is pressure within itself.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s art under pressure</p>
<p>is even more beautiful art.</p>
<p>You know, you look at some of these fights</p>
<p>and you wonder like why somebody wins and lose.</p>
<p>And sometimes the less talent guy could win</p>
<p>because he could deal with the pressure.</p>
<p>But the other guy, he could have beat them</p>
<p>if they were somewhere else, but not in this arena.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re a scholar of history, including hip hop history.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve listened to so many of your interviews.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve spoken brilliantly about some of the big figures</p>
<p>in hip hop history, Tupac, Biggie, Nas, many others.</p>
<p>Maybe let&rsquo;s look at Tupac and Biggie.</p>
<p>What made them special in the history of music?</p>
<p>Mm, that&rsquo;s a good question.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;m the authority to answer it,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ll just speak my piece on it.</p>
<p>And maybe I could just add on.</p>
<p>Cause I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s a lot of people</p>
<p>that spent a lot of time with them that could speak on it.</p>
<p>But just as a fellow artist,</p>
<p>I think not only was B.I.G a dope lyricist,</p>
<p>I think he had a voice that was really immaculate.</p>
<p>In a sense that some rappers get on top of music</p>
<p>and you gotta get used to them</p>
<p>when you gotta vibe with them.</p>
<p>But he make a record sounds like a record immediately.</p>
<p>If you go back and listen to his music,</p>
<p>you could take his voice and put it on anything.</p>
<p>And for some reason, it sounds like a record.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>You mean just like the raw voice of the man?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So you could just listen to it raw</p>
<p>and it sounds like a record.</p>
<p>Yeah, but if you put a beat,</p>
<p>take his voice and put it on any beat,</p>
<p>he just has a voice, it&rsquo;s immaculate, you know?</p>
<p>So his lyrical skills and all that was great.</p>
<p>And you gotta think once again, he&rsquo;s doing all this,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s not even 25 years old.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>And then you go to Pac, once again, immaculate voice.</p>
<p>But what Pac had, I think,</p>
<p>was a way of touching us on all of our emotions.</p>
<p>And especially on, like Pac had the power</p>
<p>to infuse your emotional thought.</p>
<p>Like Brenda has a baby, their mama.</p>
<p>But then he had the power to arouse the rebel in you.</p>
<p>You know?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And those two things, actually,</p>
<p>he was probably more dangerous than Big, Notorious B.I.G.</p>
<p>Like Notorious B.I.G., we could party with him.</p>
<p>To this day, we are still,</p>
<p>but Pac was probably going to a point,</p>
<p>he was more going into the Malcolm X of things</p>
<p>and society fears that.</p>
<p>Yeah, so he was really good at communicating love</p>
<p>and at starting revolutions.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s dangerous.</p>
<p>Very dangerous.</p>
<p>And they communicated love,</p>
<p>but he wasn&rsquo;t starting revolutions.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s interesting to think about</p>
<p>what the world would be like if they were still with us.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s the way of the world.</p>
<p>Hendrix, a lot of those guys just go too soon.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s a peculiar thing.</p>
<p>Now, you asked me earlier, am I scared of death?</p>
<p>And I answered, you know, I&rsquo;m not scared of death.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not trying to see it, though.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, that was the block of death.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, I&rsquo;m not really going right there right now.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m making a left or right turn.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>Unless it was mandatory for some greaterness, greater good.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, okay, I got to drive through that.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>Yeah, but it can still happen.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the meditation on death part,</p>
<p>where you could die at the end of today.</p>
<p>Yeah, you could die.</p>
<p>Well, dying and death, I think,</p>
<p>is two different things, personally.</p>
<p>The process you mean of death or just?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, you could die.</p>
<p>Like I said, you could die every day.</p>
<p>You could die and not be yourself.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>Which is crazy.</p>
<p>But to get to a point of no return,</p>
<p>you know, that&rsquo;s a whole nother chamber.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s some sense in which</p>
<p>RZA, the producer, becomes somebody else completely</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re making a film,</p>
<p>becomes somebody else completely</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re, I don&rsquo;t know, playing chess,</p>
<p>becomes completely something different</p>
<p>when you do kung fu or watch kung fu</p>
<p>or when you&rsquo;re a family man.</p>
<p>All of those are little deaths</p>
<p>when you transition from one place to another.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not like you&rsquo;re one being.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re many things.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I would describe, now I would describe that</p>
<p>as all life, dawg.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s fun.</p>
<p>Outside of you and anybody on Wu Tang,</p>
<p>who is the greatest rapper from a lyrics,</p>
<p>like a Wart Smith perspective in hip hop history</p>
<p>or some of the greatest, maybe some candidates?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s name a few.</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;re gonna have to start with Rakim.</p>
<p>You know?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna have to pick Coogee Rap in there.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>So going back.</p>
<p>Yeah, you&rsquo;re gonna have to pick up</p>
<p>with those brothers first.</p>
<p>You might have to, if you want to get,</p>
<p>technically you might have to start with Grandmaster Cass.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>Who you might not even heard of.</p>
<p>Nope.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>But you may have sung his lyrics</p>
<p>every time you sang Sugar Hill, Rapper&rsquo;s Delight.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s his?</p>
<p>Yeah, they copied his and they made it theirs.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my point being made, but I&rsquo;ll name a couple more.</p>
<p>I gotta pick Nas in that category.</p>
<p>You know, we got a chess board in front of us</p>
<p>and one of the greatest chess players,</p>
<p>the youngest Grandmaster, you know, before I think Carlson,</p>
<p>was Bobby Fisher.</p>
<p>All right, so let&rsquo;s use Bobby Fisher as American.</p>
<p>One of the greatest American chess players.</p>
<p>Of course, Susan Polgar may have tied his record</p>
<p>as the youngest Grandmaster</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s the youngest female Grandmaster, I think to date.</p>
<p>But he was a master at what, 14?</p>
<p>Yeah, something like that.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>So now to me, I met Nas when he was 15.</p>
<p>He was already a master lyricist.</p>
<p>It takes about 10 years to become a master lyricist.</p>
<p>So by the time the world heard Wu Tang,</p>
<p>most of us had 10 years of rapping in us already.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why you met us at mastery level.</p>
<p>The Jizzer was already a master when Nas was a master,</p>
<p>but Jizzer was 21, Nas was 15.</p>
<p>Nas is like the Mozart of rap.</p>
<p>Or the Bobby Fisher.</p>
<p>Just Bobby Fisher, just born something in him.</p>
<p>Or maybe those early years,</p>
<p>just because he&rsquo;s not just good at the lyrics.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s also, he goes deep with it.</p>
<p>Just like you.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s like, there&rsquo;s depth.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just like mastery of the word smithing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just the message you actually get sent across.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s information.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Into a small phrase, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the whole thing of energy.</p>
<p>How do we condense all that energy into this</p>
<p>so that it could fuel that?</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s definitely one of those artists,</p>
<p>MCs that does that.</p>
<p>And he was doing it at 15.</p>
<p>Like I said, I think I&rsquo;m five years</p>
<p>or four or five years older than Nas.</p>
<p>So I was always feeling my confidence</p>
<p>of what I was doing.</p>
<p>But I was like, this kid is only 15.</p>
<p>I gotta step up my game.</p>
<p>When he turned 19, then we got Illmatic.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>From you, what are the best and most memorable lyrics</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve ever written?</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s a hard question for me.</p>
<p>The stuff stand out?</p>
<p>Like stuff you&rsquo;re really proud of</p>
<p>that was like important in your career?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, I think I did a song called Sunshower.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if we put it on the Wu Tang Forever double CD,</p>
<p>but only on the international version.</p>
<p>But if anybody could go get those lyrics</p>
<p>and write those lyrics down,</p>
<p>you could just put that in your pocket.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m sure that it&rsquo;ll answer at least about 25%</p>
<p>of your life&rsquo;s problems.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s a good one.</p>
<p>Sunshine, where you talk about religion and God,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s on A Diagram.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a record guy.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a song guy.</p>
<p>Might have been A Diagram.</p>
<p>Do you have a lyric from it?</p>
<p>Yeah, the answer to all questions.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re talking about God.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>The spark of all suggestions, of righteousness,</p>
<p>the pathway to the road of perfection,</p>
<p>who gives you all and never asks more of you,</p>
<p>the faithful companion that fights every war with you.</p>
<p>Before the mortal view of the prehistorical historical,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s the all in all you searching for the oracle.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good line, man.</p>
<p>This is so good.</p>
<p>A mission impossible is purely philosophical,</p>
<p>but you can call on your deathbed</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re laying in the hospital.</p>
<p>You will call on your deathbed.</p>
<p>I had a big, I have a scientist friend.</p>
<p>Well, my wife&rsquo;s best friend, Rebecca,</p>
<p>she married a scientist.</p>
<p>They both scientists.</p>
<p>They both were scientists, and she married Dr. Neil.</p>
<p>I ain&rsquo;t going to say their last names.</p>
<p>But Neil and Rebecca, my wife&rsquo;s best friend, so they come over.</p>
<p>And me and Neil, we go through the longest debates</p>
<p>of science and religion.</p>
<p>We just go.</p>
<p>We could go break day with it.</p>
<p>And before he had a child, he was more adamant.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t believe in God.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>After a child, he still kept his thing.</p>
<p>But I just hit him with the question.</p>
<p>If you was about to die, because now you</p>
<p>got a child to think about, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s different when you&rsquo;re thinking about yourself.</p>
<p>If you was about to die, you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think you&rsquo;re going to make that call.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, I&rsquo;ll make that call.</p>
<p>And it kind of inspired my lyric, because it was like,</p>
<p>yeah, you&rsquo;re going to.</p>
<p>And I just want to say, as far as you mentioned lyrics,</p>
<p>that is one of my favorite lyrics.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s part two to Sunshower was the prequel to Sunshine.</p>
<p>So if you ever get a chance to check out Sunshower,</p>
<p>start us off with, trouble follows a wicked mind.</p>
<p>2020 vision of the prism of life,</p>
<p>but still blind because you lack the inner.</p>
<p>So every sinner could end up in the everlasting winter</p>
<p>of hellfire.</p>
<p>But thorns and splinters prick your eye out.</p>
<p>You cry out.</p>
<p>Your words fly out.</p>
<p>You remain unheard.</p>
<p>Suffering internal and external,</p>
<p>along with the wicked fraternal of genitals and kernels,</p>
<p>letting off thermal nuclear heat that burns you firmly</p>
<p>and permanently upon the journey through the journal</p>
<p>of the book of life.</p>
<p>For those who took a life without justice</p>
<p>will become just ice.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been taught your worst enemy couldn&rsquo;t harm you</p>
<p>as much as your own wicked thoughts.</p>
<p>But people ought to be not unless in war.</p>
<p>So they find themselves persecuted</p>
<p>inside their own universal court.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a long one.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a three pager.</p>
<p>Wow, that is about life.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like character integrity, how to be in this world.</p>
<p>And that ultimately connects to God.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s God to you?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad you just asked that question because I actually,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to have to make a distinguishable separation here.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s funny because I heard recently,</p>
<p>I heard a rabbi was debating with this historian, Dr. Ben.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t pronounce Dr. Ben name, but it was debating.</p>
<p>And in the debate, they started going back</p>
<p>through the etymology.</p>
<p>They went way back beyond antiquity</p>
<p>because they was debating.</p>
<p>And so there was some things that was going deep.</p>
<p>And they really went far, far back to kind</p>
<p>of the first word of God.</p>
<p>And when they pronounced it on this particular debate,</p>
<p>it was Allah.</p>
<p>And they said from that, they got Elohim.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve already agreed in my heart and my life</p>
<p>that the father of this universe, proper name is Allah.</p>
<p>And of course, in Allah, I get all.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think that God is the same as that.</p>
<p>I think Allah gives birth to God.</p>
<p>In fact, if you take the word Allah, A L L A H,</p>
<p>and you take it through numerology or numbers,</p>
<p>the number letter A being 1, L being 12,</p>
<p>and you add it all up to the last denominator,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to get the number 7.</p>
<p>And the number 7 is going to bring you right back</p>
<p>to that letter G. So Allah borns God,</p>
<p>but God don&rsquo;t born Allah.</p>
<p>How does that guy, how does Allah,</p>
<p>connect to the oracle that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to be calling for when you&rsquo;re laying in the hospital?</p>
<p>Well, what I was saying in that particular verse was that we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>looking for the oracle.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re looking for somebody else or something</p>
<p>to help us that nobody can really help you</p>
<p>at the end of the day.</p>
<p>So now that we, I don&rsquo;t want to say we&rsquo;re speaking on religion,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re speaking on a way of life and a way of thinking.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve read many books, of course.</p>
<p>And I could say there&rsquo;s no book that my,</p>
<p>the book that is the most strongest book I&rsquo;ve ever read</p>
<p>is actually the Holy Quran.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s stronger to me than the Bible, which I&rsquo;ve read.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s stronger than quantum physics, which I&rsquo;ve read.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s stronger than the Bhagavad Gita.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, and I read once a British scholar</p>
<p>said it&rsquo;s the most stupidest book ever written.</p>
<p>And it doesn&rsquo;t make sense.</p>
<p>And so I said, oh, I see why he says that.</p>
<p>I understand exactly why he said that as well.</p>
<p>Why is that?</p>
<p>Because the structure of the words are just, it&rsquo;s peculiar.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s almost like how some people&rsquo;s songs,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t really know exactly what</p>
<p>they say until years later.</p>
<p>Yeah, you have, actually with Joe Rogan,</p>
<p>I think you talked about how a joke of Dave Chappelle&rsquo;s</p>
<p>hit you like a long time after this.</p>
<p>So this is kind of like the Quran.</p>
<p>I tend to believe that we human beings cannot possibly</p>
<p>understand anything as big as these ideas.</p>
<p>So just, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Did you think that, like are you humble in the face</p>
<p>of just the immensity of it?</p>
<p>To be honest, yes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m humble in the face of the, if you could say the word</p>
<p>again, I pronounce words funny.</p>
<p>The omnipotence, the omnescence, the magnitude,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m humble in the face of Allah.</p>
<p>The problem that I may have had was</p>
<p>that I wasn&rsquo;t humble in the face of God</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s just a definable thing.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why I think a lot of us, and I&rsquo;m not saying that,</p>
<p>you know, I know when we say God we&rsquo;re trying to say Allah.</p>
<p>Like people are saying that, but you&rsquo;re actually</p>
<p>not saying the same thing because you&rsquo;re actually</p>
<p>putting something beside him.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the reason why you can have as many gods.</p>
<p>You can find a whole bunch of them, you know what I mean?</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re not going to find many.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no body beside Allah.</p>
<p>Allah is one.</p>
<p>So I know it&rsquo;s a whole thing, but that&rsquo;s my heart is there.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m humbled by it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m at peace with it.</p>
<p>And it doesn&rsquo;t take nothing or demerit anything from myself.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the beauty of it.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t take nothing from me from being who I feel.</p>
<p>So if I say, if somebody woke up, yo, peace, God.</p>
<p>I could take that because they&rsquo;re telling me that, yo,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a man of wisdom.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a man of strength.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a man of beauty.</p>
<p>Or some attribute of that, you know what I mean?</p>
<p>So Wu Tang, they the gods of rap.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s wisdom there.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s strength there.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s beauty.</p>
<p>They will take that.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So Wu Tang is one of the greatest</p>
<p>musical, artistic, philosophical groups ever.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look hundreds of years from now</p>
<p>when humans or robots or aliens or whatever that&rsquo;s left here,</p>
<p>they look back.</p>
<p>What do you hope they remember about Wu Tang?</p>
<p>What do you hope the legacy is?</p>
<p>Well, even if it&rsquo;s thousands of years,</p>
<p>I hope we don&rsquo;t get rid of the humans.</p>
<p>But you know, look, whatever happens is going to happen.</p>
<p>But I think that my philosophy on it</p>
<p>is that we&rsquo;re going to continue to advance and continue</p>
<p>to advance things around us.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t see us becoming extinct.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, the reason I bring up Wu Tang in that context,</p>
<p>and this is a special moment in human history.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like 100 years, and we&rsquo;ve created all of this music.</p>
<p>Just if you think of all the richness of music that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>been created over 100 years, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not obvious to me that that&rsquo;s not going to stop.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a flourishing here.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s funny because I could see</p>
<p>where the book of human history is written.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a chapter on this period of time.</p>
<p>And one of the things we did well is</p>
<p>all the technological innovation with the rockets</p>
<p>and with the internet.</p>
<p>But then there&rsquo;s also the musical innovation</p>
<p>and film innovation.</p>
<p>Just so much art that&rsquo;s being created.</p>
<p>And Wu Tang&rsquo;s a huge part of that.</p>
<p>So I just wonder if there&rsquo;s a few sentences written</p>
<p>about Wu Tang, it just makes me wonder how they remember.</p>
<p>I would hope that people, no matter how many years,</p>
<p>are inspired by us.</p>
<p>But I will say, if I could just use Wu Tang as itself.</p>
<p>So we first started off the witty, unpredictable talent</p>
<p>and natural game.</p>
<p>Natural game meaning natural wordplay.</p>
<p>And then we went to the wisdom of the universe,</p>
<p>the truth of Allah for a nation of God.</p>
<p>Wisdom, universal, truth, Allah, nation, God.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s just go back to a nation of God.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just take the last two letters.</p>
<p>A nation of wisdom, strength, and beauty.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m going a little political here, but not going political.</p>
<p>As we&rsquo;ll say, we&rsquo;re the greatest country in the world.</p>
<p>What makes us the greatest?</p>
<p>That should be a question we ask.</p>
<p>Is it our wisdom?</p>
<p>Is it our strength?</p>
<p>Is it our beauty?</p>
<p>Now, let&rsquo;s just say, off the easiest answer,</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s our strength.</p>
<p>We got the nukes.</p>
<p>Nobody can really, between America and Russia,</p>
<p>they say, that&rsquo;s the argument.</p>
<p>Who could beat them?</p>
<p>But where&rsquo;s the wisdom?</p>
<p>Then they can argue, well, we got the technology.</p>
<p>But then where&rsquo;s the beauty when there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>so much suffering in the people?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not complete.</p>
<p>The hope is that the wisdom is in the founding documents,</p>
<p>in the imperfect but wise founding documents</p>
<p>that celebrated freedom, that celebrated all the ideas,</p>
<p>sort of having a lot of nukes, having a lot of airplanes</p>
<p>and tanks.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not important.</p>
<p>And the hope is whatever we&rsquo;re doing here with this, quote,</p>
<p>greatest country on Earth, that we preserve the ideas</p>
<p>and help them flourish, just like you said.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s what I mean.</p>
<p>So if you go back to the Wu Tang,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re striving for.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re striving for that.</p>
<p>But you started unpredictable and just like, yeah.</p>
<p>But got deep pretty quick.</p>
<p>I got to talk to you about Bruce Lee.</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s Bruce Lee to you?</p>
<p>Who is he to the world?</p>
<p>What ideas of his were interesting to you?</p>
<p>You talk about Hendrix and music.</p>
<p>Bruce Lee is that in martial arts.</p>
<p>He just seems to have changed the game.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if the word bold is the right word to say,</p>
<p>but I wouldn&rsquo;t as bold as to say that he was a minor prophet.</p>
<p>And I got that concept from the Holy Quran</p>
<p>where it says that we send prophets</p>
<p>to every nation, every village.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t let nobody not hear the word in some form</p>
<p>because it won&rsquo;t be fair.</p>
<p>And so if a law is merciful, even a man who&rsquo;s deaf</p>
<p>has to somehow get a sign.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if Moses saw a burning bush.</p>
<p>There was nobody else to talk to,</p>
<p>so he had to talk to the bush.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>It could have been the bush this way too, right?</p>
<p>But point being made, it says that they are minor prophets.</p>
<p>And I see Bruce Lee as one of them</p>
<p>because what he brought to the world through martial art</p>
<p>was a whole shift in the dynamic of thinking.</p>
<p>And that happens when certain entities are born.</p>
<p>But he didn&rsquo;t do it only in a physical sense.</p>
<p>He was also for the philosophizing</p>
<p>in the same process.</p>
<p>And he was also striving to be the best of himself.</p>
<p>So you got three things going on.</p>
<p>I studied Bruce Lee multiple times.</p>
<p>And first, of course, when I saw my first Kung Fu movie,</p>
<p>it wasn&rsquo;t really Bruce Lee.</p>
<p>It was a few Green Hornet clips cut together.</p>
<p>And then I saw Black Samurai.</p>
<p>Then my following Kung Fu movies was like Fearless Fighters,</p>
<p>the Ghostly Face, the Fist of Double K.</p>
<p>But basically, in Fearless Fighters,</p>
<p>the lady put the little kid on her back</p>
<p>and flew across the ocean, across the lake, right?</p>
<p>So Bruce wasn&rsquo;t doing that.</p>
<p>And then I went on to Five Deadly Venoms, and Spearman,</p>
<p>and 36 Chambers.</p>
<p>And these movies are beautiful, and yet they&rsquo;re all heightened.</p>
<p>Bruce, they&rsquo;re heightened beyond doable.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not going to.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s surreal.</p>
<p>They play with the world that&rsquo;s not of this world.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Bruce played with this world.</p>
<p>So when I first saw Bruce, I actually</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t think he was as good as these guys.</p>
<p>He can&rsquo;t fly.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not flying in the movies, right?</p>
<p>But then when I saw, because the first one I saw</p>
<p>was The Big Boss, which they retitled Fist of Fury.</p>
<p>But then when I saw Chinese Connection, which</p>
<p>is the real Fist of Fury, right?</p>
<p>I saw something different there.</p>
<p>And I got enamored.</p>
<p>And then, of course, Enter the Dragon, right?</p>
<p>Just really complete.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why my first album was Enter the Wu Tang,</p>
<p>36 Chambers of Shaolin.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s Enter the Dragon and 36 put together,</p>
<p>because those are the two epitomes.</p>
<p>So what happened is that&rsquo;s young me.</p>
<p>Then teenage me studies him again.</p>
<p>And I realized, wow, look at his physicality.</p>
<p>Look how he&rsquo;s really moving for real.</p>
<p>And then I studied him again.</p>
<p>Wow, look at what he&rsquo;s saying.</p>
<p>Then I studied him again.</p>
<p>Wow, look at what he stands for.</p>
<p>Which do you like in the realm of martial arts, the real</p>
<p>or the surreal, or the dance between the two?</p>
<p>Yeah, I like the dance between the two,</p>
<p>because a movie, to me, is to entertain you.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m cool with Obi Wan Kenobi disappearing out of the cloak</p>
<p>when Vader strikes him down.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;m like, yo, what happened?</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, run, Luke, run.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m cool with that, right?</p>
<p>Because that&rsquo;s the imagination.</p>
<p>And the imagination gets stimulated to the point</p>
<p>to where as things that we saw imagined by an artist,</p>
<p>we strive to create in our real world.</p>
<p>Thus, Star Trek, to me, is just a precursor to our cell phones.</p>
<p>So for me, I like to mix the two.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s funny how science fiction pushing</p>
<p>into the impossible actually makes it realize eventually.</p>
<p>We humans, once we see an idea on screen,</p>
<p>no matter how wild it is, we&rsquo;re trying to make it.</p>
<p>Yeah, we&rsquo;re trying to make it.</p>
<p>Some weird young kid, he gets inspired and watch that.</p>
<p>Be like, I&rsquo;m going to build that.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know who&rsquo;s going to come with the Back</p>
<p>to the Future time machine.</p>
<p>But do you have any classmates that you think</p>
<p>this is going to be a time machine?</p>
<p>I thought you were going to Back to the Future, like the,</p>
<p>what is it, the hoverboard?</p>
<p>Or like the, uh?</p>
<p>Yeah, at least.</p>
<p>Somebody, they got, you see the one on the water?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>No, you know the surf hover?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s dope.</p>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s dope.</p>
<p>It actually, if you are a Back to the Future fan,</p>
<p>you feel like you made it to, you made it there.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, now we just got to work on the time trial.</p>
<p>And it was cool to hear you talk about the Master of the Flying</p>
<p>Gaijin today, that that inspired the lyric for the Wu Tang</p>
<p>client, Nothing to F with.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>How does that go again?</p>
<p>What, the curse word or the lyric?</p>
<p>Nothing.</p>
<p>OK.</p>
<p>No, I remember the curse.</p>
<p>I am Russian, but the lyric.</p>
<p>I said, I be tossing and forcing.</p>
<p>My style is awesome.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m causing more family feuds than Richard Dawson.</p>
<p>And the survey said, you&rsquo;re dead.</p>
<p>The fatal flying guillotine chops off your head.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And it was interesting to see the guillotine in the movie</p>
<p>today, how, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s surreal, right?</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s engineering.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s both surreal and it just, and it adds this chaos</p>
<p>into this real world that, and then challenges everybody</p>
<p>to think what you&rsquo;re going to do with that.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>How are you going to beat it?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>How are you going to beat it?</p>
<p>Both when you have like the good and the evil</p>
<p>and the mix of the bad guys and good guys</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re not sure who the bad guys are.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the old question of good versus evil, right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Like you said, then the question of who was good, who was evil.</p>
<p>But they all had a similar problem when the guillotine came.</p>
<p>But in terms of the real, you mentioned The Godfather,</p>
<p>good and evil.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s your favorite movie.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What makes it great, do you think?</p>
<p>The characters, the study of family, of justice, of power.</p>
<p>What connects with you?</p>
<p>Oh, oh, I mean, every one of those themes</p>
<p>connects in the real and it connects in a cinematic way</p>
<p>as well.</p>
<p>The difference, I think, with me and The Godfather</p>
<p>was I&rsquo;ve seen it during a period of time</p>
<p>when my father was absent.</p>
<p>And therefore, family structure and family values</p>
<p>was actually adopted in my family because of that.</p>
<p>Me and my brother Devon, we actually</p>
<p>took so much heed to that movie and our family life.</p>
<p>And we kind of mimic that family in its structure of somebody</p>
<p>has to be the leader of the family,</p>
<p>even if it was the younger.</p>
<p>Michael was younger than Sonny and Fragile.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>But he was worthy.</p>
<p>And my brother Devon is older than me.</p>
<p>My brother King is older than me.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s funny, sometimes Devon calls King Fragile.</p>
<p>And I know King wants to.</p>
<p>King was actually, he actually was,</p>
<p>he said he could beat our ass, to use my language.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re Michael.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And not by choice, just by definition of that&rsquo;s what I am.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just a blessing for me to have my older sister,</p>
<p>my older brothers, and my younger brothers look to me as,</p>
<p>just as a good light in the family.</p>
<p>And like I said, that movie helped us.</p>
<p>My sisters, too, we, the cool thing about my family,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if I share this a lot,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a big, we all watched these movies together.</p>
<p>And so the A Diagram, Pole Fighter, Master Killer,</p>
<p>Five Deadly Venoms, my family knows these movies.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just I know them.</p>
<p>And then you extend it further, my friends know them, too.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a language that we all can have that actually film</p>
<p>has informed our communication.</p>
<p>So The Godfather, which also is still a fictitional story</p>
<p>of something, but since it was based in reality,</p>
<p>based on something real, and it was human,</p>
<p>it wasn&rsquo;t so heightened, I think the purity of it resonates.</p>
<p>And the purity of it is something</p>
<p>that resonates with me.</p>
<p>You got to plan ahead.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t want to deal with the drugs,</p>
<p>but that time of business was upon him.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s almost like, this is a tough one,</p>
<p>like sometimes when the Muslim brothers come from the Middle</p>
<p>East to America and they open up delis, they would sell ham.</p>
<p>And we would go in there and complain to them,</p>
<p>and make them like, they used to get mad at us</p>
<p>when we came in.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s as a kid.</p>
<p>But as a man, I&rsquo;m like, yo, he&rsquo;s here to sell.</p>
<p>Now, he still don&rsquo;t have to sell to him.</p>
<p>Vito Corleone didn&rsquo;t want to sell the drugs.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t have to do it.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>And it cost him some bullets to eventually,</p>
<p>somebody in the family ended up doing it.</p>
<p>What about this idea that it&rsquo;s family before everything else?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s different laws you live according to in this world,</p>
<p>and family is first.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s mathematically correct.</p>
<p>I like that.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s a certain sense of you look at powerful people.</p>
<p>You look at Putin.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a certain sense in which the people who</p>
<p>are in the inner circle, that&rsquo;s who you take care of.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s family.</p>
<p>And anyone else that crosses you,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a different set of ethics under which you</p>
<p>operate for those people.</p>
<p>Well, Jesus said the same thing.</p>
<p>When he said, love thy neighbor and thy brother,</p>
<p>he was talking about that community.</p>
<p>When that other lady, the Samaritan, say, hey, Jesus,</p>
<p>my brother not feeling so well, and he said,</p>
<p>give not that which is holy unto the dogs.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re going to tell a woman, give not</p>
<p>that which is holy unto the dogs.</p>
<p>And she&rsquo;s a woman.</p>
<p>He just called her a dog.</p>
<p>If I translate that into hip hop, she&rsquo;s a female.</p>
<p>He called her a dog.</p>
<p>I know how that goes.</p>
<p>But she said to him, but even a dog</p>
<p>is allowed to eat the crumbs that</p>
<p>falls from the master&rsquo;s table.</p>
<p>And he went and helped.</p>
<p>He helped her.</p>
<p>Now, let&rsquo;s go back to what you just said about Putin</p>
<p>or Vito Corleone or myself and my family.</p>
<p>Of course, the family is first.</p>
<p>But once the family is good, it has</p>
<p>to then spread to the community, then</p>
<p>to the state, country, world.</p>
<p>The problem we have sometimes is that,</p>
<p>and this is the reason why a lot of powerful families</p>
<p>was overthrown, like why do they behead</p>
<p>their own king with the guillotine, right?</p>
<p>Because once the family was strong,</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t let the wealth, the opportunity expand out.</p>
<p>You look at Wu Tang, yes, our family was made strong first.</p>
<p>But then all the Wu members were able to form</p>
<p>their own corporations.</p>
<p>And they had their own subfamilies.</p>
<p>It has to grow out.</p>
<p>And they took over the world.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve talked about being vegan.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I heard you explain this,</p>
<p>because it connects somehow about how you think about life.</p>
<p>So you talk about when your family&rsquo;s good,</p>
<p>you grow that circle of empathy.</p>
<p>You grow the community.</p>
<p>Is that how you think about being vegan,</p>
<p>that just the capacity of living beings on Earth to suffer,</p>
<p>that you just don&rsquo;t want to add suffering to them?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, you said it clear.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like nothing, in all reality,</p>
<p>I came to a realization that nothing really</p>
<p>has to die for me to live.</p>
<p>No animal.</p>
<p>The plants themselves, right?</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s just say you want a steak, which is probably</p>
<p>the most, I don&rsquo;t know, the most expensive piece of meat.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s just say the steak is top of the line, nice steak.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re eating the steak for the protein to help</p>
<p>build your muscle.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know if you got it from a cow or a bull,</p>
<p>but whether it&rsquo;s a cow or a bull,</p>
<p>they grow to about 1,500 pounds.</p>
<p>And if it&rsquo;s a bull, it&rsquo;s all muscly muscle.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s only eating grass.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s possible to, both as an athlete</p>
<p>and just as a human being, to perform well</p>
<p>without eating meat.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s something, especially in the way</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re treating animals, to deliver that meat to the plate.</p>
<p>I think about that a lot.</p>
<p>So I do, I&rsquo;m a robotics person, AI person.</p>
<p>And I think a lot about, I don&rsquo;t know if you think</p>
<p>about this kind of stuff, but building AI systems</p>
<p>as they become more and more humanlike,</p>
<p>you start to ask the question of, are we okay?</p>
<p>If we give the capacity for AI systems to suffer,</p>
<p>first to feel, but then to suffer,</p>
<p>to hate and to love, to feel emotion,</p>
<p>how do we deal with that?</p>
<p>It starts asking the same question as you ask of animals.</p>
<p>Are we okay adding that suffering to the world?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think we should add the suffering</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not necessary.</p>
<p>Like, look, if it&rsquo;s necessary, right,</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re survival or the first law of nature,</p>
<p>self preservation, if you are in a desert</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s nothing else to eat,</p>
<p>but that lizard, yeah, okay, you gotta do what you gotta do.</p>
<p>Lizard&rsquo;s gotta go.</p>
<p>Yeah, you gotta go, you gotta do what you gotta do.</p>
<p>Because at the end of the day, man is,</p>
<p>when they say man has dominion over these things,</p>
<p>his dominion is almost like a caretaker.</p>
<p>The way we do our dominion, we dominate it,</p>
<p>eat it, cook it.</p>
<p>Like who&rsquo;s the first guy that looked at the lobster?</p>
<p>He was like, I&rsquo;m gonna eat this thing.</p>
<p>Like, first of all, it&rsquo;s hard to eat it.</p>
<p>You gotta go through a process to get that.</p>
<p>A crab, I remember we used to eat crabs when we was kids</p>
<p>and I didn&rsquo;t know why I was always getting itchy throats</p>
<p>and all that, you know, you don&rsquo;t know, just eat.</p>
<p>But at the end of the day, a crab didn&rsquo;t provide</p>
<p>no more than a finger worth of meat maybe.</p>
<p>And it was hell getting that thing, getting it out.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s not worth it in all reality.</p>
<p>You could have gave me a banana</p>
<p>and did better for my body and my appetite</p>
<p>and my being fulfilled as full.</p>
<p>Like, look at the blessings of life, right?</p>
<p>If you take a seed or you get an apple and you eat it,</p>
<p>in that apple is multiple seeds in it.</p>
<p>If you plant that seed, it&rsquo;ll give you a whole tree</p>
<p>with a whole bunch of apples with all multiple seeds.</p>
<p>But if you kill a fish, it can&rsquo;t reproduce, it&rsquo;s done.</p>
<p>If you kill a, it&rsquo;s done, it&rsquo;s nothing coming back.</p>
<p>But when you deal with the plants,</p>
<p>even after you eat the apple and then you defecate,</p>
<p>your defecation is what feeds the ground</p>
<p>to cause the apple to grow more.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s a circle of life.</p>
<p>And especially there&rsquo;s a guy named David Foster Wallace,</p>
<p>he wrote a short story called Consider the Lobster.</p>
<p>If you actually think philosophically about what,</p>
<p>from a perspective of a lobster,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like symbolic of something</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re basically put in the water, like cold water,</p>
<p>and then it heats up slowly until it&rsquo;s no more.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s torture, yeah, it must have been like,</p>
<p>do you think they started eating lobsters</p>
<p>in the Inquisition?</p>
<p>Yeah, they just enjoy,</p>
<p>they would probably enjoy torturing animals</p>
<p>and they realize they&rsquo;re also delicious</p>
<p>after the torture is finished,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s probably how they discovered it.</p>
<p>Let me ask you a question,</p>
<p>I know you&rsquo;re asking me the questions,</p>
<p>but I just wanna talk a little bit about the AI,</p>
<p>and you said something about trying to</p>
<p>put the emotion in it, right?</p>
<p>So are you thinking there&rsquo;s an algorithm for emotion?</p>
<p>Yes, but I think emotion isn&rsquo;t something</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s an algorithm for for a particular system,</p>
<p>we create emotions together.</p>
<p>So emotion is something like this conversation,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like magic we create together.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve worked with quite a few robots,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve a very simple version of that,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had Roomba vacuum cleaners,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had them make different sounds</p>
<p>and one of them is like screaming in pain, like lightly,</p>
<p>and just having them do that when you kick them</p>
<p>or when they run into stuff,</p>
<p>immediately I start to feel something for them.</p>
<p>So the emotion, okay, so the emotion you&rsquo;re saying</p>
<p>is imposed back on the human,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m asking, do you think there&rsquo;s an algorithm</p>
<p>for the emotion to be imposed from machine to machine?</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s a really good way to ask it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s difficult because I think ultimately</p>
<p>I only know how to exist in the human world.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s the question of</p>
<p>if a tree falls in the forest, nobody&rsquo;s there to see it,</p>
<p>does it still fall?</p>
<p>I still think that ultimately machines will have to</p>
<p>show emotion to other humans</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s when it becomes real.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking about this a lot too.</p>
<p>And I just, okay.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m not gonna hit you with this</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ve been thinking about this</p>
<p>and this is your field here.</p>
<p>Well, do you think the emotion is wave?</p>
<p>Like light is wave or do you think it&rsquo;s particle?</p>
<p>So emotion is just a small,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like a shadow of something bigger.</p>
<p>And I think that bigger thing is consciousness.</p>
<p>So emotion is just.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s a wave or a particle.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t thought about that.</p>
<p>I have thought about it, whether it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something like whether consciousness</p>
<p>or emotion is a law of physics.</p>
<p>Like if it&rsquo;s that fundamental to the universe.</p>
<p>I had a lyric that said this, it comes out.</p>
<p>They did this documentary about the planet</p>
<p>and I wrote a song, it&rsquo;s called The World of Confusion.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll try to paraphrase the lyric,</p>
<p>but in the world of the confusion,</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s so much illusions,</p>
<p>we suck the blood from the planet.</p>
<p>Now it needs a transfusion</p>
<p>and the redistribution of wealth,</p>
<p>of health and wealth of self</p>
<p>and a deeper understanding about mental health.</p>
<p>The doctor prescribed the physical solution.</p>
<p>The psychiatrist wants to build a bigger institution,</p>
<p>but neither have the solution or the equation</p>
<p>to make an instrument to measure</p>
<p>the weight of the hate vibration.</p>
<p>What is the weight of hate?</p>
<p>Is it heavier than the weight of love?</p>
<p>Is it heavier than the weight of lead inside of a slug?</p>
<p>With just 10 milligrams, it&rsquo;s all it takes to kill a man.</p>
<p>But anyways, do not go on from there.</p>
<p>Damn, that&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>But the question, you see the question there, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah, can it be measured?</p>
<p>Can that be measured?</p>
<p>I think so, I think so.</p>
<p>Just look at the instrument, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, we&rsquo;re in the dark ages of that,</p>
<p>but I think it could be measured.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s something physical,</p>
<p>like something that connects us all this much.</p>
<p>We tend to think we humans are distinct entities</p>
<p>and we move about this world,</p>
<p>but I think there&rsquo;s some deeper connection.</p>
<p>And, but we&rsquo;re so, listen, science is in the,</p>
<p>we just had a few breakthroughs in the past 100 years</p>
<p>from Einstein on the theoretical physics side.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know anything about human psychology.</p>
<p>We barely know much about human biology.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re trying to figure it all out.</p>
<p>Yeah, I had another theory,</p>
<p>because, you know, you think about quantum, right?</p>
<p>As long as you say that there&rsquo;s an uncertainty</p>
<p>and you have me believe there&rsquo;s an uncertainty,</p>
<p>then there&rsquo;s an uncertainty.</p>
<p>But if there&rsquo;s not an uncertainty, what happens?</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m only saying that, it&rsquo;s not,</p>
<p>because you look at quantum computers,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna give you the O, the one,</p>
<p>the one, the O, they&rsquo;re gonna take two things</p>
<p>and make it eight things.</p>
<p>And by the time you multiply four of those things together,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like this chess board, right?</p>
<p>The moves goes into the millions.</p>
<p>But the thing that&rsquo;s introduced is the uncertainty, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna make a move.</p>
<p>You know this already, right?</p>
<p>Because this has been played a thousand times,</p>
<p>but sooner or later, something uncertain is gonna come in</p>
<p>or make your next move.</p>
<p>I like the weight of these.</p>
<p>They add the certainty.</p>
<p>I think just like what we were saying, unpredictable,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something about us humans</p>
<p>that really doesn&rsquo;t like everything to be fully predictable.</p>
<p>I mean, chess too is perfectly solvable.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing unpredictable about chess.</p>
<p>Right, well, I could agree to that</p>
<p>because Bobby Fischer said in one of his books,</p>
<p>which I actually love what he said.</p>
<p>He said, every game of chess is a draw.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>The only way somebody win is when one of us makes a mistake.</p>
<p>I mean, it doesn&rsquo;t get any better than that.</p>
<p>Yeah, it doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>What is chess?</p>
<p>Like, how do you think about chess?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s at the core of your interest in chess?</p>
<p>Do you see Kung Fu, music, film, all of it, life,</p>
<p>all just living through chess?</p>
<p>Yeah, I see, it&rsquo;s the most stimulating passage of time</p>
<p>for me that&rsquo;s also, it&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s a pastime</p>
<p>that stimulates my mind, my music,</p>
<p>my thoughts about life at the same time.</p>
<p>So while some pastimes is like,</p>
<p>say baseball is a pastime.</p>
<p>And baseball could stimulate you</p>
<p>depending on how you look at it, right?</p>
<p>But most likely, you&rsquo;re not gonna get</p>
<p>this much brain activation, this much calculation,</p>
<p>and this much thinking about yourself</p>
<p>in a game of baseball.</p>
<p>I mean, the player maybe, but not the viewer.</p>
<p>Chess is something that I can engage in too.</p>
<p>And even though it&rsquo;s a pastime,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s given me all the stimulation of real time in my life.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny because it&rsquo;s also, it&rsquo;s a funny game</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s connected through centuries of play.</p>
<p>Just some of the most interesting people</p>
<p>in the history of the world have played this game</p>
<p>and have struggled with whatever,</p>
<p>have projected their struggles onto the chessboard</p>
<p>and thought, and the nations have fought</p>
<p>over the chessboard.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union versus the United States,</p>
<p>Bobby Fischer represented the United States.</p>
<p>Spassky represented the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I gotta, before I lose track of it,</p>
<p>when we were talking about The Godfather,</p>
<p>you were in American Gangster, great film.</p>
<p>You said it&rsquo;s one of your favorites too.</p>
<p>What, you were in it with Denzel Washington.</p>
<p>What makes that movie meaningful to you?</p>
<p>What was it like making that movie?</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s a great, great American film.</p>
<p>That was a great American film.</p>
<p>It was so many things in that film.</p>
<p>Being a part of that film was probably a blessing</p>
<p>and a treasure, because even if I wasn&rsquo;t a part of it,</p>
<p>it just caught such great filmmaking</p>
<p>and to me, a really cool, great story.</p>
<p>The thing that I love about it the most</p>
<p>really is the process of it.</p>
<p>Which part of the process?</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t have known the process if I wasn&rsquo;t part of it.</p>
<p>So as a film joy, it was a great film,</p>
<p>but even the process of making it</p>
<p>was like high level education for me on multiple levels.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m working with Ridley Scott, which is,</p>
<p>and this is a bold statement if I say this here,</p>
<p>cause I got a lot of friends that&rsquo;s going to probably,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s probably the best living director.</p>
<p>Because watching him allowed me to understand</p>
<p>a principle that I&rsquo;ve coined to him</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t know if people use it yet, called multi vision.</p>
<p>He seems to have the capacity to see eight things</p>
<p>at one time.</p>
<p>I heard on Robin Hood, he had 18 cameras.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t there for that.</p>
<p>And you think he keeps them all in his mind, just seeing.</p>
<p>I seen him do it when he went to the monitors</p>
<p>with the video playback guy.</p>
<p>I seen him bring everything back to a point,</p>
<p>but nothing was the same on the frame.</p>
<p>He was already there.</p>
<p>And he knew if he had what he was or not.</p>
<p>And he placed the cameras there.</p>
<p>And he saw it in his own way.</p>
<p>And I peeped it.</p>
<p>I peeped it.</p>
<p>And I said, yeah.</p>
<p>And I just humbly asked him.</p>
<p>He was gracious enough to speak to me and talk to me.</p>
<p>And confirm what I thought I saw.</p>
<p>He confirmed it.</p>
<p>And I was able to utilize it, as I&rsquo;m a filmmaker now.</p>
<p>And I see, I can at least see three or four things.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t see eight yet.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be there though.</p>
<p>But I could definitely, even right now,</p>
<p>just I could go like this in the room, OK?</p>
<p>I got it now.</p>
<p>I got how to make this right here,</p>
<p>which is just us all sitting.</p>
<p>How do I make this dramatic?</p>
<p>Look, boom.</p>
<p>Come on on him.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a story there.</p>
<p>And I might just go off his hanging watch</p>
<p>or his hanging wristband.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Because there&rsquo;s something else there too.</p>
<p>Is he dead?</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>So he has this.</p>
<p>And even though this is the scene.</p>
<p>Yeah, you keeping that in mind, all of this in mind.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What about like, can you give an inkling</p>
<p>of other parts of the process, like the editing?</p>
<p>Like where does the magic happen?</p>
<p>Another thing.</p>
<p>Pedro, I don&rsquo;t pronounce Pedro last name right.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a cool guy.</p>
<p>I had a chance to play rugby with him.</p>
<p>He was on, was he on my team?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>We were in both teams.</p>
<p>But Pedro, the editor who edited many great films,</p>
<p>once again, he has, I will call, deciphering power.</p>
<p>A good editor is a decipher, almost like breaking</p>
<p>the enigma, because he&rsquo;s dealing with thousands,</p>
<p>or we&rsquo;ll call it a film, with millions of feet of film,</p>
<p>at least a million feet of film.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a lot of film for a feature.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s dealing with that.</p>
<p>But he&rsquo;s dealing with multiple cameras.</p>
<p>So it ain&rsquo;t like it&rsquo;s like two cameras.</p>
<p>He got an A, B, and he could just go back.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>He may have six cameras, and he has to go back</p>
<p>and deal with that process.</p>
<p>And you know what?</p>
<p>He knows how to tell the story again.</p>
<p>And he proved it on American Gangster</p>
<p>as me being a witness, because it&rsquo;s so much information.</p>
<p>Even when the brothers all start getting their little business</p>
<p>and then he put one in the Bronx,</p>
<p>he just captured every neighborhood within one minute,</p>
<p>and you knew what would happen.</p>
<p>You knew it all.</p>
<p>You saw the whole rise of fame.</p>
<p>You watched the Palmer and Scarface,</p>
<p>who does it in two minutes, but it&rsquo;s only one character.</p>
<p>So you see him go to the bank.</p>
<p>He drops the money off.</p>
<p>You see him buy the lion.</p>
<p>You see him gets his wife, or the tiger.</p>
<p>You see him gets his wife, you see all that.</p>
<p>And then it ends on the big side of him in a big house</p>
<p>with all the TV screens.</p>
<p>And you seen him go through it, right?</p>
<p>But in American Gangster, you&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to tell that story of rising, but you also got</p>
<p>to include these five brothers.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s all in the edit.</p>
<p>Oh, man.</p>
<p>But also all in the director knowing that as well.</p>
<p>And you got to keep thinking about them, because that</p>
<p>was a story right there.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>While I was hearing it, I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>if they was taking pictures of him,</p>
<p>or they might have a little party over there.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Chess, I think.</p>
<p>Yeah, I like it.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re playing chess in the distance.</p>
<p>This is great.</p>
<p>You said that you were always an old soul</p>
<p>and see the world as if you&rsquo;re 200 years old.</p>
<p>I like this line.</p>
<p>Because your creative vision allows</p>
<p>you to see the final piece you&rsquo;ve created,</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re creating very quickly, quicker than others.</p>
<p>I heard that as if you&rsquo;ve almost lived many lives.</p>
<p>You have this experience that allows you to see the vision.</p>
<p>So let me ask you on creativity, where</p>
<p>does this creativity behind RZA come from,</p>
<p>both musically and film wise?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if I have the answer to that one, right?</p>
<p>Seriously, where does it come from?</p>
<p>Only thing I could say about that</p>
<p>is that for some reason, it seems endless.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s peculiar when I think about it myself,</p>
<p>because I was taught a lot of things from the JZA.</p>
<p>He introduced me to mathematics.</p>
<p>He introduced me to hip hop itself, to break dancing.</p>
<p>I got other cousins that introduced me to graffiti,</p>
<p>cousins that introduced me to DJing.</p>
<p>I realized that I had a lot of introductions,</p>
<p>but the JZA definitely, my older cousin,</p>
<p>gave me a lot of early inspirations.</p>
<p>And not saying that he&rsquo;s not creative,</p>
<p>as creative as he was then or now,</p>
<p>the wide span of creativity, I don&rsquo;t see him doing that,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t see the cousins that taught me how to DJ.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t see them move from DJing to making the beats.</p>
<p>My cousin who actually got me into instruments,</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t see him leave funk and rock.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m an orchestra composer now.</p>
<p>So I just said to myself, I just accept myself as an artist,</p>
<p>as a creative artist.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I am.</p>
<p>I have to accept that.</p>
<p>Now, where it comes from, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>If I was to try to say where it comes from,</p>
<p>like, hey, give me some type of answer,</p>
<p>I would say from life itself.</p>
<p>But what does it feel like?</p>
<p>Because you mentioned during this pandemic,</p>
<p>for example, for some reason, more</p>
<p>came to you in terms of writing.</p>
<p>And so do you feel like you&rsquo;re just receiving signals</p>
<p>from elsewhere, or do you feel like it&rsquo;s hard work,</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re just waiting?</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not even waiting, nor is it hard work.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like I said in one of my other lyrics,</p>
<p>this is for the MC part of it.</p>
<p>I said, MCing to me is easy as breathing.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like breathing.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s just like, in fact, there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>actually was a scientific thing I read about that.</p>
<p>Now that you&rsquo;ve said that.</p>
<p>You heard this?</p>
<p>I know you&rsquo;ve had to hear this.</p>
<p>They say that the atoms in our atmosphere, which</p>
<p>seem to be infinite in number, are not infinite</p>
<p>in the space they occupy.</p>
<p>Because they&rsquo;re in our atmosphere.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s a chance that at least 1 million atoms</p>
<p>that you breathe in your life was breathed by Galileo.</p>
<p>You heard this before, right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>OK.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very accurate.</p>
<p>OK.</p>
<p>How does your body digest it?</p>
<p>Oh, let&rsquo;s start at the fact that most of the atoms that we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>made of is from stars, right?</p>
<p>Stars burst.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re all really connected fundamentally somehow.</p>
<p>And then the atoms that make up our body come and leave.</p>
<p>And the same with the cells that are in our body,</p>
<p>they die and are reborn.</p>
<p>And we don&rsquo;t pay attention to any of that.</p>
<p>That all just goes through us.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>That makes me feel like I&rsquo;m not an individual.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just a finger of something much bigger,</p>
<p>some much bigger organism.</p>
<p>Well, because you&rsquo;re drinking the coffee there, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to digest that.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to digest those atoms,</p>
<p>whether you&rsquo;re going to put them through the bowel</p>
<p>or through the urination, it&rsquo;s coming out.</p>
<p>Or maybe you&rsquo;ll sweat it out.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You might sneeze it out.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re going to make their way out.</p>
<p>How do you digest the atoms if you just breathe in Galileo?</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what I think an artist does.</p>
<p>I think something in the artist, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like some people eat things and they&rsquo;re going to gain weight.</p>
<p>Some people ain&rsquo;t going to gain weight.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to gain muscle.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just give you an analogy here.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m thinking that the artist breathes in and translates it</p>
<p>into the art.</p>
<p>First, they got to hear it.</p>
<p>I think most of us don&rsquo;t hear that.</p>
<p>We receive it, but it just doesn&rsquo;t come out.</p>
<p>Yeah, we not have the frequency.</p>
<p>I said this to a lot of artists.</p>
<p>And even we all can consider ourselves artists</p>
<p>in a certain way.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s just say there&rsquo;s only one million artists</p>
<p>in the world.</p>
<p>Good.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s probably 10.</p>
<p>If you divide that into the population,</p>
<p>what part of the table would it be?</p>
<p>The tiny part.</p>
<p>It might be that, right?</p>
<p>And yet, it&rsquo;s that that inspires that.</p>
<p>And you know what&rsquo;s so crazy about that, though?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also a chance.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just going numbers and I&rsquo;m just hypothesizing with you.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s also a chance that all of this</p>
<p>is actually informing that.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>The artist is just watching this, all of this,</p>
<p>all the chaos of this.</p>
<p>Yeah, so it&rsquo;s hard to know where the beauty comes from.</p>
<p>Is it the artist or the chaos from the?</p>
<p>So I just say I don&rsquo;t have the answer.</p>
<p>But if I was to be forced to say an answer,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re not twisting my arm, but I&rsquo;ll say.</p>
<p>I can if you want me to.</p>
<p>No, thank you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll say life.</p>
<p>Yeah, life.</p>
<p>In Tao of Wu, you write something about confusion,</p>
<p>which I really like.</p>
<p>Confusion is a gift from God.</p>
<p>Those times when you feel most desperate for a solution,</p>
<p>sit, wait.</p>
<p>The information will become clear.</p>
<p>The confusion is there to guide you.</p>
<p>Seek detachment and become the producer of your life.</p>
<p>So I got to ask you advice.</p>
<p>If a young person today in high school, college</p>
<p>is looking for some advice, what advice</p>
<p>could you give them to be a producer of a life</p>
<p>that can be proud of?</p>
<p>Read the Tao of Wu.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with the Wu Tang manual first.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>No, you could do that second.</p>
<p>Second?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I think you could read the Tao of Wu first</p>
<p>and then do the manual.</p>
<p>Because the manual is not to put the two books against each</p>
<p>other, but the manual is talking about things</p>
<p>that is so deeply connected to the music.</p>
<p>And the people in the Tao of Wu goes beyond that.</p>
<p>So I would actually start there, which is not normally</p>
<p>what I would prescribe.</p>
<p>I always tell people, start in knowledge, then go to wisdom.</p>
<p>But since the Tao of Wu.</p>
<p>Skip ahead to the wisdom.</p>
<p>I like it.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think for a young man in high school,</p>
<p>go to the Tao of Wu and then go back.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like sometimes you have my son&rsquo;s generation,</p>
<p>they have to watch the second round of Star Wars.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And then they go back.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>This generation is watching The Force Awakens.</p>
<p>And then they go back.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But what, because if you just look at your life as an example,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s one heck of a life.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s very few lives like it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve created some of the most incredible things</p>
<p>artistically in this world.</p>
<p>Like if somebody, you talk about that like 1 million, right?</p>
<p>At the corner of the table.</p>
<p>If somebody wants, strives, dreams to become one of those,</p>
<p>how do they do it?</p>
<p>Well, the beautiful thing is that there</p>
<p>are footprints left by those who&rsquo;ve done it.</p>
<p>And the best way is to study that.</p>
<p>To study those who&rsquo;ve already done what you want to do.</p>
<p>We live on a civilization.</p>
<p>As we said, this is the greatest country in the world.</p>
<p>But our seal is a pyramid with an I on it.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>Because they did it before.</p>
<p>And they may have failed for some reason</p>
<p>or something happens.</p>
<p>But it was just a strong enough example to take us further.</p>
<p>Elon Musk is sitting here trying to do better than what</p>
<p>the rocket builders did before.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not the first one to build the rocket.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not the first guy to think of with the electric car.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s doing it better.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s advancing it to the point that whoever</p>
<p>picks up after him, maybe they&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>get to that flying car.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the beauty.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a good verse.</p>
<p>I love finding verses to say things to confirm.</p>
<p>Because this way, people could take it verbally, physically,</p>
<p>and then maybe even spiritually.</p>
<p>But Christmas has said a verse.</p>
<p>He said, the fastest way to heaven</p>
<p>is by spending time or studying the wise people.</p>
<p>Meaning the wise people who are living</p>
<p>and those who live before you.</p>
<p>Study the masters.</p>
<p>Let me ask you a big, perhaps ridiculous question,</p>
<p>but give it a shot.</p>
<p>What is the meaning of this whole thing?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the meaning of life?</p>
<p>Big question.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to rush into the answer.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to give you somebody else&rsquo;s answer first,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll give you my answer.</p>
<p>I remember asking this when I was 15, 16 years old.</p>
<p>One of the brothers was studying in mathematics.</p>
<p>And the letter I itself means I Islam.</p>
<p>I meaning the individual being in total accord with Islam.</p>
<p>And let me finish this.</p>
<p>Then they took the word Islam, and they</p>
<p>defined it as Islam is an Arabic word for peace.</p>
<p>Then they said, peace is the absence of confusion.</p>
<p>OK?</p>
<p>So then they took them.</p>
<p>This is something that really hit me when I never forgot it.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m going to decipher it.</p>
<p>But then they took the word Islam,</p>
<p>and they broke it down by the letter into an acronym,</p>
<p>like cash, with everything around me.</p>
<p>And they broke it down to I stimulate light and matter.</p>
<p>And I was like, what?</p>
<p>Because what hit me is that if you&rsquo;re not here,</p>
<p>then light and matter don&rsquo;t exist to you.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re stimulating it, or it ain&rsquo;t here for you.</p>
<p>So anyway, taking all that.</p>
<p>But then I said, so what&rsquo;s the meaning of life?</p>
<p>And the brothers just said, love Islam forever.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And I said, I ain&rsquo;t saying the religious point of it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just saying all those other elements</p>
<p>I just spoke about in front of it.</p>
<p>I stimulate light and matter.</p>
<p>I love that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s powerful.</p>
<p>And let me give you my definition of life.</p>
<p>I think life is simply for each and every one of us</p>
<p>to add on to.</p>
<p>Build.</p>
<p>Like you said, the masters.</p>
<p>Build on top.</p>
<p>Life gave you life.</p>
<p>Give life back.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s a better way to end it than talking</p>
<p>about the meaning of life.</p>
<p>RZA, I&rsquo;m a huge fan.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s such a huge honor that you spend your valuable time</p>
<p>with me.</p>
<p>Thank you so much.</p>
<p>Thank you for inviting me.</p>
<p>Peace.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation with RZA.</p>

<p>Poetry is nearer to vital truth than history.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.</p>
