then we&rsquo;ll answer some questions how</p>
<p>about that awesome okay so last week we
recovered some information about insulin</p>
<p>the adrenals so we&rsquo;re going to talk
about the gonads what are the gonads and</p>
<p>the testicle and the ovary as it relates
to their main hormones now there&rsquo;s a lot</p>
<p>to know about estrogen we&rsquo;re going to
cover the stuff that only problem that</p>
<p>shows up that relates to your body and
I&rsquo;m just going to make sure that my</p>
<p>references right here you just check
everything</p>
<p>voila
I have them right here okay cool so I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>just going to open these slides let&rsquo;s
just close some of the stuff down here</p>
<p>okay perfect all right got it okay
so I can make this a little bit bigger</p>
<p>but last time um the slides got stuck so
tonight I&rsquo;m going to just check on to</p>
<p>make sure these slides are working okay
so we talked about the gonads what are</p>
<p>the gonads the gonads are male and
female reproductive organs let&rsquo;s start</p>
<p>with the ovary the ovary makes estrogen
the ovaries create hormones to create</p>
<p>female characteristics it gives the
woman their curve certain cultures have</p>
<p>different more accentuate occurs because
they have more of a certain hormone</p>
<p>estrogen controls the menstrual cycle
controls making the egg fertile in the</p>
<p>uterus and then you have the testicle
the testicle makes sperm possible for</p>
<p>you Lupita a bone and muscle influences
vitality and it also works closely with</p>
<p>another gland called a prostate now I&rsquo;m
just curious as I go through this I want</p>
<p>to make sure that there&rsquo;s no words that
I give you that you don&rsquo;t fully get so</p>
<p>does anyone know what the prostate does</p>
<p>okay
can you up to wait just a second here</p>
<p>what does the prostate do does anyone
know give it a second here okay I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know I don&rsquo;t know someone says it
produces testosterone gives us enzymes</p>
<p>no no no it&rsquo;s where the semen is okay so
apparently you</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s totally fine so enlarges when you
get old exactly</p>
<p>so the prostate does really two things
it doesn&rsquo;t make sperm it&rsquo;s okay when a</p>
<p>male ejaculate the sperm goes out and
it&rsquo;s it pushes the sperm it also</p>
<p>provides a fluid that goes along with
the sperm to help the sperm survive you</p>
<p>also have other glands around that that
also assist okay so that&rsquo;s what the</p>
<p>prostate does oh you know okay let me go
back to my slides all right so I&rsquo;ll try</p>
<p>it enlarged this so we can see and
you&rsquo;ll just have to I&rsquo;m gonna see if</p>
<p>this actually advances you see if it if
it worked we see yes it did work okay</p>
<p>good so I can do this awesome
so we&rsquo;re going to talk about estrogen</p>
<p>dominance this is the most common
problem with women but not even before</p>
<p>menopause even after menopause and I&rsquo;ll
explain why because as you age you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>supposed to lose your estrogen right but
there&rsquo;s other parts of your body and</p>
<p>tissues like your fat cells that make
estrogen so if you have a lot of fat</p>
<p>after menopause your body can make a lot
of extra estrogen yeah your adrenals</p>
<p>make estrogen the dreams are the backup
organ to the ovaries so during menopause</p>
<p>you can have estrogen dominance for that
reason and also because another hormone</p>
<p>called progesterone drops down to even
more than estrogen so it gives a</p>
<p>relative increase of estrogen because
estrogen and progesterone work together</p>
<p>so during menopause if progesterone
really drops down to the bottom you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>left with a relative high ratio of
estrogen to progesterone you&rsquo;re still</p>
<p>estrogen dominant so you need both of
those hormones to work together</p>
<p>but if your estrogen dominant you&rsquo;re
going to get what&rsquo;s called endometriosis</p>
<p>endometriosis is the condition where you
get a scar tissue that time it develops</p>
<p>because of extra estrogen around the
inside your abdomen around the uterus</p>
<p>inside the uterus all over the place the
endometrium is kind of like the lining</p>
<p>of the the uterus okay so it&rsquo;s the whole
lining of the uterus that&rsquo;s what it is</p>
<p>irregular periods cellulite especially
in that in the outer hips the lower</p>
<p>pooch of your belly and your thighs in
your butt</p>
<p>okay infertility that&rsquo;s why they give
you birth control pills more estrogen to</p>
<p>get to make you not fertile PMS mood
change is depression all these different</p>
<p>things fibroids ovarian cysts breast
lumps thyroid nodules so those are all</p>
<p>of the symptoms of estrogen dominance
okay there&rsquo;s more the next thing you</p>
<p>need to know is that during a menstrual
cycle you have these hormonal shifts at</p>
<p>day 14 you have the spike of estrogen
that spikes up and spikes down so in</p>
<p>other words day 14 is a very different
time period for the cycle in that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>the most fertile that&rsquo;s when you&rsquo;re
ovulating that&rsquo;s when the egg is being</p>
<p>released down these little tubes
fallopian tubes down to the uterus</p>
<p>become fertilized so you have this spike
of estrogen so estrogen is the hormone</p>
<p>that spikes at day 14 okay it just comes
up and it goes down you also have</p>
<p>another hormone called luteinizing
hormone that&rsquo;s for the brain and follow</p>
<p>the assuming that hormone that&rsquo;s in the
brain tube from the pituitary but don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>worry about those at this point the
thing you need to know is estrogen</p>
<p>increases at a 14 and progesterone
increases about a week before your</p>
<p>period
so if you have a problem like one week</p>
<p>before your period you know your cycles
on that step or you have moodiness or</p>
<p>craving or whatever we know it&rsquo;s
progesterone if it&rsquo;s during ovulation we</p>
<p>know it&rsquo;s estrogen okay</p>
<p>symptoms of high and low estrogen uh too
high breast tenderness bloating emotions</p>
<p>up and down pounding headaches weight
gain yeast infections depression</p>
<p>excessive growth of the fibroid
fibrocystic breast joints pain water</p>
<p>retention irritability blood sugar
issues now if it&rsquo;s too low you&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to hot flashes night sweats insomnia
mental fogginess decrease sexual drive</p>
<p>in lubrication so draw vaginal dryness
depression fatigue frequent urination</p>
<p>migraine headaches memory and
concentration problems dry skin</p>
<p>osteoporosis other that you&rsquo;re perfectly
fine okay just want to make sure that</p>
<p>your your um okay
so I&rsquo;m just going to kind of answer a</p>
<p>question as we go through someone says
that I thought they said I thought you</p>
<p>said if you have a hot flashes during
menopause or postmenopausal that meant</p>
<p>that you have too little estrogen but
you also have a belly fat that would</p>
<p>mean that the estrogen dominance so you
have too little too much okay very very</p>
<p>very good question here&rsquo;s what happens
it&rsquo;s very very similar to estrogen</p>
<p>resistance insulin resistance shows high
levels of insulin on one part of your</p>
<p>body and low other say in with core so
you can have symptoms of high cortisol</p>
<p>and low corstel because you have
cortisol resistance so when the estrogen</p>
<p>becomes high downgrade and become
resistance and so you have symptoms of</p>
<p>low and high at the same time that&rsquo;s
really what&rsquo;s happening and so lying in</p>
<p>the vaginal area so you become dry so
you it&rsquo;s not going into it&rsquo;s not the</p>
<p>adrenals are not backing them up
effectively so you get hot flashes night</p>
<p>sweats so it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s not clear-cut and
that&rsquo;s why when you take estrogen and</p>
<p>you have um flashes for example you can
get rid of hot flashes just like that by</p>
<p>taking HRT hormone replacement therapy
but then it creates all these other</p>
<p>problems of estrogen dominance so it
fixes one thing but gives you another</p>
<p>problem like cancer so that&rsquo;s what
happens um now let me just see if</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s any other quick questions here</p>
<p>okay
slide didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>advanced darn it okay so we&rsquo;re dealing
with that again okay so what I&rsquo;m going</p>
<p>to do is I&rsquo;m just going to go back and
forth so we can make sure lines okay</p>
<p>so I won&rsquo;t go like five slides into it
so let me just go to the next slide</p>
<p>right now okay estrogen therapy okay so
here&rsquo;s what happens</p>
<p>women some women take estrogen a lot of
women are stopping to take that taking</p>
<p>the esterday each Norman placement
therapy like they did like 10 years ago</p>
<p>or 20 years ago because it has some side
effects</p>
<p>okay stroke my mother she worked as a
nurse and I was able to acquire some of</p>
<p>the records in the nursing home of
people who had been on estrogen therapy</p>
<p>or hormone replacement therapy and I
noticed one common denominator there all</p>
<p>had strokes which is interesting so too
much estrogen can lead to blood clots</p>
<p>okay
cancer women who took estrogen are four</p>
<p>to seven times more likely to develop
cancer now why does this relate to the</p>
<p>endocrine system because use with women
there&rsquo;s so many receptors for estrogen</p>
<p>like especially on the breast in the
uterus and the ovaries and that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>happening of the estrogens going too
high but from my viewpoint this is just</p>
<p>my opinion I don&rsquo;t think this is coming
from necessarily your estrogen it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>coming from the environmental estrogen
okay now there&rsquo;s another question that</p>
<p>someone said well what about hormone
replacement therapy like bioidentical</p>
<p>hormones okay is that better that&rsquo;s
better but my thought is that if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to go on HRT or a bio identical
hormones what I would recommend is that</p>
<p>you first try to fix the real problem
okay</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not normal for you to have symptoms
even past menopause if your we are</p>
<p>working properly and don&rsquo;t buy into that
oh yeah everyone has is meant to produce</p>
<p>less those hormones but it should be
fine so my whole suggestion is to fix</p>
<p>the ovary support the ovary the ovary is
controlling the the estrogen and the</p>
<p>progesterone and the testosterone so why
would you take a hormone because you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to you&rsquo;re going to inactivate your
own hormones that are producing that</p>
<p>okay now someone says I had hysterectomy
so I take estradiol for hot flashes and</p>
<p>night sweats it took them away but I
recently started having night sweats</p>
<p>again so I started taking your cortisol
could that be taking too much in causing</p>
<p>night sweats well what happens is the
cortisol support is great typically for</p>
<p>hot flashes especially if you if you
actually have a real true deficiency of</p>
<p>adrenal and ovary hormones because it
basically helps you build more hormones</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not for people that have high
cortisol as for people that have low</p>
<p>coarse or low the correct action for the
remedy for hot flashes would be my ovary</p>
<p>support formula because that just
supports the gland but then if it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>really severe then we add the core
social support so so the goal is to</p>
<p>support the ovary as much as possible
and after you&rsquo;ve done everything you can</p>
<p>if you still have problems go ahead and
take the bioidentical but I don&rsquo;t I</p>
<p>won&rsquo;t just recommend going right to that
right away because your side effects</p>
<p>cancer especially if a woman has taken
estrogen over seven years</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like them that&rsquo;s like the cut
point cutoff point and I&rsquo;m also talking</p>
<p>about birth control pills and I know
that&rsquo;s the situation for a lot of women</p>
<p>and I do have some solutions but the
problem is that birth control pills or</p>
<p>replacement therapy it just gives you a
lot of estrogen so estrogen therapy also</p>
<p>creates tumors it decreases testosterone</p>
<p>now depo-provera this is a type of
synthetic progesterone it&rsquo;s injected</p>
<p>every select three or six months
actually I think it&rsquo;s every three months</p>
<p>and it gives massive massive amounts of
hormonal you know interference in your</p>
<p>body in fact in the 1973 the FDA denied
the Peru of depo-provera but of course</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t put it on the market it just
has some it has some serious side</p>
<p>effects like breast cancer weight gain
breast tenderness I do not recommend</p>
<p>depo now it&rsquo;s more convenient for women
because you just get one shot and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>good for three months I understand that
but think about if you have to take</p>
<p>something to turn off your period for
three months</p>
<p>you think that might create been
creating a problem for your body yeah it</p>
<p>is um alright so no another question is
what if I don&rsquo;t have hormones what if I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have ovaries okay then what you
need to do is get get a spare skin go</p>
<p>find them clean them up and put it back
now just getting what you need to do is</p>
<p>you need to support them with different
things because you have a backup organ I</p>
<p>like to support the adrenal if you don&rsquo;t
have ovaries because the dream will make</p>
<p>the same hormones as the ovaries and so
what you can do is you can take the</p>
<p>support the adrenal and you should be
fine because the adrenals should take</p>
<p>over and start backing up the ovaries
okay that&rsquo;s what I recommend everyone&rsquo;s</p>
<p>asking about breast tenderness and
breast cancer I&rsquo;m getting to that point</p>
<p>um and someone also mentioned my mother
took des when I was pregnant when she</p>
<p>was pregnant with me des is a is called
step diastole the best role</p>
<p>diethylstilbestrol I can even talk and
that is a massive massive spike of</p>
<p>estrogen so des was used to prevent
miscarriages for like 30 years until</p>
<p>they found that it caused
miscarriages so it creates a lot of</p>
<p>problems for women and in the offspring
hormone only for the thyroid it creates</p>
<p>a lot of problems so as we get to the
seminar I must show you if you&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>exposed to DES a couple things to
detoxify yourself okay all right so now</p>
<p>the next thing I&rsquo;m going to talk about
is the estrogen thyroid connection let</p>
<p>me show you something</p>
<p>okay so just bring this forward right
here you can see this okay okay this is</p>
<p>the thyroid these are ovaries the
estrogen is interesting because it has</p>
<p>the ability to decrease the thyroid
hormones okay Wow the way okay so</p>
<p>estrogen can block the thyroid it can
fit into the receptors of the thyroid</p>
<p>gland so when you increase the thyroid
the ovary hormones like estrogen and</p>
<p>will lower the thyroid hormones and that
is why during pregnancy so many women</p>
<p>develop trans because of the high
estrogen most thyroid problems are</p>
<p>secondary to high estrogen during a
pregnancy estrogen dominance taking</p>
<p>birth control pills other sources of
estrogen okay there cause of thyroid</p>
<p>problems
here&rsquo;s your liver</p>
<p>the liver debates the thyroid hormones</p>
<p>t4 to t3 most thyroid problems are not
primary they&rsquo;re secondary to either</p>
<p>estrogen dominance or a problem with
your liver or gallbladder okay there</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t that third condition which is the
autoimmune condition</p>
<p>Hashimoto&rsquo;s or grades which almost
always occurs during a stress event so</p>
<p>because stress activates the adrenals
that would then cause autoimmune Mona&rsquo;s</p>
<p>is an adrenal problem okay so I just
want to get into that and I&rsquo;ll show you</p>
<p>what to do about in a little bit but let
me just kind of continue on with my</p>
<p>slides
okay now the thyroid hormones are made</p>
<p>from iodine so the t4 to t3 represent
the number of iodine atoms in that</p>
<p>thyroid hormone okay so um the
conversion process from t4 to t3 also</p>
<p>needs another mineral called selenium so
you need both of these minerals to have</p>
<p>a thyroid work very very well so iodine
you can get from sea kelp</p>
<p>seafood cranberries navy beans potatoes
but we don&rsquo;t recommend that</p>
<p>strawberries we&rsquo;re not recommending
fruit our berries right now selenium</p>
<p>Brazil nuts you can get oysters tuna
sardines eggs spinach and seek help okay</p>
<p>so we need those two minerals and you
can really help the thyroid function if</p>
<p>you actually have those minerals in
there in the diet the problem is because</p>
<p>the soils are so low with these are
trace minerals you never really see them</p>
<p>in the diet anymore you have to take
them extra in an extra form like you</p>
<p>know if you eat seaweed or sea kelp or
you have to consume more of</p>
<p>and outside source or a supplement to
get those hypothyroidism a low thyroid</p>
<p>then can lead to slow gonads or actually
a hypo ovary or a non functioning ovary</p>
<p>so we need that thyroid to work if that
thyroid goes down you have a cascade of</p>
<p>hormonal problems that go really really
wide to a lot of problems okay so we</p>
<p>have to be able to figure out is the
chicken or the egg</p>
<p>in my experience the most common things
and you have to ask the person when did</p>
<p>it start to get the clue of the primary
problem and was it a pregnancy was it a</p>
<p>stress event was it a thorough it ectomy
when they took with our it up see if you</p>
<p>if you know that then you can find out
if it&rsquo;s the chicken or the egg</p>
<p>now the breast tissue I&rsquo;m guessing I&rsquo;m
hoping you can see these slides okay for</p>
<p>the breast the breast sized is
controlled by estrogen so women that</p>
<p>have larger breasts have more estrogen
it&rsquo;s definitely a symptom of estrogen</p>
<p>dominance but not necessarily all the
time you can have small breasts in huge</p>
<p>hips and happy estrogen dominant okay
now a lot of women go to the doctor to</p>
<p>get a breast exam to make sure they
don&rsquo;t have any lumps or precancerous</p>
<p>benign cyst or and the breast okay so
we&rsquo;re going to talk about that but</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s the thing um fibrocystic breasts
which are little cysts in the breast or</p>
<p>even benign cysts in the breasts they&rsquo;re
all pre they come before cancer a lot of</p>
<p>time a lot of times you have a lump that
turns into something over time so it</p>
<p>goes sometimes from benign to malignant
okay so what we want to do is we don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>want to wait until you&rsquo;re 55 6 years old
until you get cancer</p>
<p>Morgan I&rsquo;m going to show you how to
actively aggressively prevent cancer</p>
<p>because by the time you get it you&rsquo;re
going to be so freaked out about it</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to be you know in a fear
state which is not a good place to be</p>
<p>and then the doctor is going to scare
you into removing your breasts or taking</p>
<p>out the lump or doing invasive surgery
and chemo and radiation and that&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>a lot of times it&rsquo;s unnecessary because
it can be prevented okay so before I go</p>
<p>on to the next thing I wanted to see if
there&rsquo;s any questions that you guys have</p>
<p>let me see</p>
<p>pitching underneath the breast symptoms
of breast cancer no that is not a</p>
<p>symptom of breast cancer um
postmenopausal bleeding let&rsquo;s see about</p>
<p>to turn 60 let&rsquo;s see
you may have low amounts of vitamin A</p>
<p>that could be causing the bleeding uh
article states certain amounts of</p>
<p>vitamin A build up in the listen Kathy
if you have a lot of vitamin A cannot</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost impossible to become vitamin
a toxic unless you&rsquo;re taking a</p>
<p>supplement of vitamin A that&rsquo;s synthetic
come too toxic from vitamin A from food</p>
<p>unless you&rsquo;re eating bare liver or
something like that okay where they have</p>
<p>super concentrations of vitamin A so
it&rsquo;s highly unlikely that it&rsquo;s vitamin A</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll get into some remedies and
solutions for that so this little</p>
<p>still sticking alright sorry about that
I will um I must go send you guys the</p>
<p>slides and I will also not do too many
slides at one time okay</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to show you how to prevent
breast cancer okay um I was act for mood</p>
<p>swings I&rsquo;m going to show you what to do
for that as well</p>
<p>you guys are in the right place tonight
because I&rsquo;m going to show you some stuff</p>
<p>that really works that&rsquo;s very effective
um</p>
<p>I thought I would start to fall under
yeah my flower a certain fall to the</p>
<p>birth of my daughter and it means that
you had a spike of estrogen and the</p>
<p>estrogen blocked the thyroid and so when
you take two you may find that all your</p>
<p>symptoms don&rsquo;t go away because the
problem problem is not your thyroid it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the estrogen dominance that you need to
clean up okay good questions alright so</p>
<p>let me show you the next slide here</p>
<p>menopause here&rsquo;s what happens you know
of course when you go through menopause</p>
<p>you can have a drop in in estrogen
big-time but you you have way more</p>
<p>deficiencies of progesterone than you do
estrogen so the relative ratios of</p>
<p>estrogen progesterone I will show you
that you have too much estrogen so you</p>
<p>may not be estrogen dominant but you
have way too much for um for the levels</p>
<p>of progesterone and so you have what&rsquo;s
called unopposed estrogen which means</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s out of balance it&rsquo;s very similar to
sodium and chloride so salt in potassium</p>
<p>so let&rsquo;s say for example the body you&rsquo;re
consuming too much salt without</p>
<p>potassium you get fluid retention so
then you would you can avoid salt but if</p>
<p>you took more potassium you can actually
lower your relative ratios of sodium by</p>
<p>taking the opposite mineral so the
is that during menopause the natural</p>
<p>thing to happen is the adrenals take
over and yes you&rsquo;re producing less</p>
<p>estrogen but you may need some help to
support the back-up Oregon the hormones</p>
<p>during menopause which is the adrenal
okay so a lot of women actually get</p>
<p>results with progesterone creams and I&rsquo;m
not opposing that and it&rsquo;s love that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>natural but let&rsquo;s kind of look at the
whole picture first before we decide</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to start taking hormones
hormone creams hot flashes you can see</p>
<p>the adrenal glands are the back up to
the ovaries if that ovary stops working</p>
<p>then the adrenals um also can&rsquo;t back
them up because they&rsquo;re tired you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to get hot flashes so with
menopause we want to always support the</p>
<p>ovary in the adrenal at the same time
okay I&rsquo;ll get into what to do in a</p>
<p>second in a minute um now I want to make
sure my slides are advancing okay let me</p>
<p>just I&rsquo;m going to do one at a time I
want to talk about something called</p>
<p>polycystic ovarian syndrome you might
not have this but some people might have</p>
<p>it and I might just need to cover what
that is PCOS now poly means many cysts</p>
<p>on the ovary or disorders could be could
be called PCOD disorder or PCOS but in</p>
<p>reality it&rsquo;s not really a cyst
it&rsquo;s a follicle which is very different</p>
<p>than assists they should call it Poli
follicular ovarian syndrome but they</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t it means that polycystic ovarian
syndrome is going to produce more</p>
<p>androgens energy
are the male hormone so you get facial</p>
<p>hair a deeper voice you get acne you get
belly fat all right but the question is</p>
<p>why are you produced why um why don&rsquo;t
men have this problem you know what I</p>
<p>mean they have high estrogen because
like you might say well it&rsquo;s the high</p>
<p>level of androgens that&rsquo;s causing this
problem right it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s really the</p>
<p>question is what causes this and I&rsquo;m
going to tell you it&rsquo;s not there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>another mechanism here and that is this
it&rsquo;s insulin insulin can increase</p>
<p>insulin has receptors in the ovary next
to the androgen receptors when you have</p>
<p>high levels of insulin it can trigger an
excess of androgens that&rsquo;s the cause and</p>
<p>effect relationship and that is why
every single person with polycystic</p>
<p>ovarian syndrome has insulin resistance
but what they&rsquo;re telling you is that</p>
<p>polycystic ovarian syndrome is a disease
that has an Associated symptom of</p>
<p>insulin resistance that&rsquo;s incorrect
this is the cause of that how do I know</p>
<p>that because all you have to do is
correct in some resistance and this goes</p>
<p>away
okay now I&rsquo;ve done webinars last webinar</p>
<p>on how to fix instant resistance I have
videos and YouTube on my blog how to fix</p>
<p>insulin resistance so I&rsquo;m not going to
get into it because I have a lot to</p>
<p>cover but I&rsquo;m just letting you know if
you have PCOS you have to bring insulin</p>
<p>down down real low to be able to do this
so watch other videos actually correct</p>
<p>that okay so that&rsquo;s polycystic ovarian
syndrome</p>
<p>okay good next association we&rsquo;re going
to talk about the Ola the prostate</p>
<p>okay the prostate is a pump and the
question is what causes prostate</p>
<p>enlargement okay now on the webinar we
have a bunch of women and a few men and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to tell you or you can
actually even talk you know if you&rsquo;re if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re married I&rsquo;m going to just like
here that&rsquo;s a little bit better okay</p>
<p>close the shades worked in it
okay so um here&rsquo;s what happens a lot of</p>
<p>times we&rsquo;re us men are told that we have
to this is ridiculous</p>
<p>trying to get this light I think as this
it&rsquo;s reflecting off this thing here a</p>
<p>lot of time men are told that what
causes prostate enlargement is excessive</p>
<p>testosterone a very powerful
testosterone called DHT okay that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>testosterone but it&rsquo;s true why do men
when they get older have prostate</p>
<p>enlargement but they show signs of low
testosterone or you know lower</p>
<p>availability erectile dysfunction um
prostate enlargement urination problems</p>
<p>they have all the symptoms of low
testosterone</p>
<p>if high testosterone caused prostate
enlargement that doesn&rsquo;t make sense so</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s the truth there are treatments
out there that treat prostate</p>
<p>enlargement with DHT which is high
powered testosterone so they&rsquo;re actually</p>
<p>taking testosterone to fix the prostate
because the truth is</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s high estrogen so estrogen increases
and make things bigger testosterone</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t the truth of the prostate
enlargement is that these men have too</p>
<p>much estrogen and they have too little
testosterone okay so that&rsquo;s why they</p>
<p>lose some of the hair on their legs this
can become smooth their voice starts go</p>
<p>starts to go higher that a lot of
urination problems because it&rsquo;s high</p>
<p>levels of estrogen that&rsquo;s what causes it
so what they should do is lower the</p>
<p>estrogen to be able to fix the prostate
okay Oh again I want to just check if</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s any question so I&rsquo;m sure there
is um someone says that what can change</p>
<p>the health of the sperm oh I&rsquo;m going to
cover that says estrogen I&rsquo;m going to</p>
<p>talk about that you guys are already
there with me if you had your thyroid</p>
<p>removed you&rsquo;re gonna have to take all
right hormones okay so because you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to need to take it but I&rsquo;m going
to recommend taking a natural thyroid</p>
<p>hormone so like armored thyroid if you
can find it all right</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to also talk about if you have
PMS I&rsquo;m going to talk about what to do</p>
<p>for high and low estrogen so no worries
on that it C can you have PCOS without</p>
<p>ovaries no you cannot but you might have
symptoms of facial hair and that could</p>
<p>come from the adrenals arian only occurs
if you have ovaries can you reverse</p>
<p>facial hair yeah absolutely but you have
to fix the insulin resistance watch the</p>
<p>videos from last week please show me
stretches for exercises waiting from</p>
<p>your video just
yeah we&rsquo;re not going to be doing</p>
<p>exercises of this um if your voice is
lowered as a result a PCOS is reversible</p>
<p>absolutely these hormones and can bounce
back okay you can you can do a lot for</p>
<p>your hormones and so don&rsquo;t have a biome
that you can&rsquo;t reverse a lot of these</p>
<p>issues okay all right so now I&rsquo;m going
to go into the next section here okay</p>
<p>testosterone what does it do
produces facial hair produces sperm</p>
<p>prostate growth only when you&rsquo;re growing
as this as a you&rsquo;re growing initially</p>
<p>but as soon as you hit like 20 years old
stop growing okay</p>
<p>strength muscles a sex drive bone muscle
that&rsquo;s what testosterone does alright</p>
<p>this is what I want to talk about right
now um a lot of you are probably</p>
<p>wondering like why did that might have
estrogen dominance why why is there so</p>
<p>much estrogen after why are people
getting breast cancer it&rsquo;s because</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s this environmental estrogen I
don&rsquo;t know if you knew this but um</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a term called
endocrine disruptors or we can call them</p>
<p>environmental estrogens because
endocrine disruptors basically are all</p>
<p>the different things in the environment
that mimic estrogen okay and so it&rsquo;d be</p>
<p>like pesticides insecticides herbicides
fungicides heavy metals like estrogen so</p>
<p>they act like your own hormones all
right there in your in the the weed</p>
<p>killers in your food there in the in
your lawn there in the they&rsquo;re all over</p>
<p>the place gardening there at the they&rsquo;re
like new furniture has endocrine</p>
<p>disruptors I there in the
food supply there in the vegetables that</p>
<p>are in the plants or the corn and the
soy that feed the animals so they&rsquo;re all</p>
<p>over the place so it&rsquo;s hard to be come
to these things</p>
<p>now you remember um DDT it was banned in
1971 um</p>
<p>DDT is still being found in over 50
percent of children okay</p>
<p>nowadays that it was banned in 1971 so
what I want to ask you right now how can</p>
<p>this be possible how can anyone be
exposed to DDT but because it&rsquo;s been bad</p>
<p>did anyone tell me where this DDT is
coming from and I&rsquo;ll wait for your</p>
<p>answer
as I answer another question oh yeah</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s in you just want to know what was
the natural thyroid it&rsquo;s called armor</p>
<p>they have other ones too like natural
thyroid hormones okay the armor is one</p>
<p>that I know it&rsquo;s like a natural it gives
you all the hormones okay okay so</p>
<p>someone saying the soil of soil the soil</p>
<p>all right so Vivian you&rsquo;re correct third
wheel word world countries countries</p>
<p>like Mexico South America see in the US
in the winter we get our fruits and our</p>
<p>vegetables from third world countries
which there we sell are DDT to Mexico</p>
<p>and South America let me buy the
vegetables back in the winter that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re getting it from DDT DDT was
banned for a reason so we got DDT um</p>
<p>still out there um it&rsquo;s also in the soil
probably not as much as it was 30</p>
<p>years after DDT was banned Americans
still consume trace amounts of the the</p>
<p>insecticide along with 20 other banned
chemicals welcome to Planet Earth now</p>
<p>the next thing my talk about it said the
GMO okay genetically modified we&rsquo;ll have</p>
<p>to give you a t-shirt
GMO oMG WTF are we eating okay what are</p>
<p>GMO then the result of genetically
altered foods so they take the DNA from</p>
<p>one species and they artificially forced
it into the genes of another unrelated</p>
<p>plant or animal the foreign genes may
come from bacteria viruses insects</p>
<p>animals or even humans okay that&rsquo;s what
GMOs are okay don&rsquo;t worry it&rsquo;s worse</p>
<p>glyphosate okay now I have to make sure
that you&rsquo;re seeing this slide can you</p>
<p>guys see that okay lye phosphate is</p>
<p>pretty good it is Roundup Ready that is
the main herbicide we killer it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>basically um in all the GMO oh because
the reason why they make the GMO is to</p>
<p>resist that glyphosate herbicide so they
can spray on the corn the soy the wheat</p>
<p>the beet sugar cotton the mangos the
papaya so they can spray it so they can</p>
<p>basically have this plant resist that
and sprayed more so these foods always</p>
<p>have residue of glyphosate okay so I
just want to let you know that is the</p>
<p>main chemical that you&rsquo;re being exposed
to right now against your will don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>worry that gets a little bit worse um
widely it&rsquo;s the most widely used</p>
<p>herbicide over 600,000 tonnes in 2008
all right it&rsquo;s in the United States 33</p>
<p>percent Brazil Argentina China India
in India glyphosate is found in the</p>
<p>urine at 93% of Americans tested Wow
were they getting this from well you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have to label GMO foods anymore so
no you never did it in the US I think in</p>
<p>Europe you can label them but that&rsquo;s
where you&rsquo;re getting it but don&rsquo;t worry</p>
<p>Monsanto said that it&rsquo;s safe they say
it&rsquo;s classified as a practically non</p>
<p>toxic chemical so you have nothing to
worry about right they say on their</p>
<p>website that over 40 years of use 800
studies over 60 countries and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>completely safe however there&rsquo;s been
some studies done by some really</p>
<p>critical people a credible scientist
that found they did the studies a little</p>
<p>longer than three months okay and
they&rsquo;re independent studies and they</p>
<p>found that they developed tumors and
died earlier okay so but what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>interesting it&rsquo;s very hard to find this
research because it&rsquo;s been retracted</p>
<p>they basically force them to reject the
the data which is is just incredible</p>
<p>that they did that they&rsquo;re so powerful
okay glyphosate is banned in France</p>
<p>Netherlands Brazil Colombia Bermuda so
it&rsquo;s mainly in America we just you know</p>
<p>we use it an MIT researcher stated that
glyphosate herbicide will cause half of</p>
<p>all children to have autism by 2025
that&rsquo;s another length that is</p>
<p>fascinating because we you know a lot of
research is on vaccinations but you</p>
<p>never would think that would be on these
GMO foods as well now I don&rsquo;t know if</p>
<p>you can see this slide but there&rsquo;s a
there&rsquo;s a little bit of a conflict of</p>
<p>interest between Monsanto who makes
glyphosate or roundup ready and the</p>
<p>government so there&rsquo;s a lot of the
people who worked for months ahead to</p>
<p>even the vice president now okay okay
even the works for the actually elected</p>
<p>to the Supreme Court used to work for
Monsanto so you&rsquo;re wondering why there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>so much corruption but you don&rsquo;t have to
look very far</p>
<p>now here&rsquo;s really what kind of blew me
away and there&rsquo;s a cold Monsanto</p>
<p>Protection Act where it was signed that
if if at any time there was a lawsuit he</p>
<p>found that GMO foods were dangerous or
whatever this would protect Monsanto</p>
<p>they can continue to sell it and they
will not get in trouble okay so this is</p>
<p>Monsanto their sister companies for
jente Dow Chemical Company Bayer DuPont</p>
<p>so they basically passed a law to
protect themselves which is incredible</p>
<p>incredible so I wanted to press you
anymore so let me just see make sure</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s any let&rsquo;s see if there&rsquo;s any
questions oh you couldn&rsquo;t see the slides</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna send you all the slides it
mows are banned in Europe that&rsquo;s awesome</p>
<p>I love it that&rsquo;s funny Monsanto&rsquo;s
cafeteria in England advertises that</p>
<p>they are not serving of foods in the
cafeteria that is hilarious</p>
<p>Wow interesting okay so let me get to
the next slide</p>
<p>yeah all right so let&rsquo;s so let&rsquo;s go and
write into the solution now that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>done being depressed okay um is this one
little amazing mineral called iodine</p>
<p>iodine decreases estrogen dominance
awesome awesome awesome</p>
<p>iodine decreases insulin and helps
insulin resistance iodine increases</p>
<p>testosterone
it also iodine decreases the risk for</p>
<p>cancer
iodine supports the thyroid the ovary</p>
<p>the breast and the uterus okay so that&rsquo;s
really really cool</p>
<p>the problem is that in the 70s we had
50% more iodine in our foods than we do</p>
<p>now the other thing that&rsquo;s interesting
is that if you&rsquo;ve heard of women with</p>
<p>cysts and fibrocystic breast
especially fibrocystic breast or cysts</p>
<p>on the ovaries so fast with iodine um
it&rsquo;s really it&rsquo;s a fibrocystic breast as</p>
<p>a precancerous thing and you get a
little iodine I like to give seek help</p>
<p>and that goes away
okay so iodine is the known anti cancer</p>
<p>simple remedy all right so now is iodine
salt absolutely not unless you have sea</p>
<p>salt and only then it&rsquo;s going to be a
very small amount</p>
<p>now ayodhya salt does have iodine more
okay and that&rsquo;s a there&rsquo;s two types of</p>
<p>iodine there&rsquo;s elemental from rocks and
minerals and then you have plant based</p>
<p>iodine which I like because your body
can absorb it better that&rsquo;s why we use</p>
<p>seek help seek help is one of the best
sources of iodine okay interesting</p>
<p>interesting interesting okay I know
there&rsquo;s some questions hang in there</p>
<p>all the problems of iodine deficiency
dry skin cysts any cysts that you have</p>
<p>anyone to body fatigue thyroid problems
ovarian probs see what I wanted to</p>
<p>mention was the you know here about
iodine with the thyroid iodine is for</p>
<p>the ovary just as much as the thyroid
your ovaries female reproductive organs</p>
<p>need iodine trace nose to get rid of a
lot of problems including hot flashes</p>
<p>okay and for a lot of women not 100% of
time but in a lot of women cognitive</p>
<p>problems menstrual irregularities weight
gain a breast pain enlarged breasts</p>
<p>during a menstrual cycle cold feed
infection psoriasis type 2 diabetes</p>
<p>thinning the hair depression puffy face
miscarriages goes on and on and on okay</p>
<p>so I will send you the slides okay so
here&rsquo;s the next slide hopefully you can</p>
<p>see it so we know that low thyroid
causes low testosterone and low iodine</p>
<p>can cause low testosterone and high
estrogen causes low testosterone so</p>
<p>guess what you&rsquo;re going to actually
recommend for a male to improve their</p>
<p>testosterone iodine seek help that&rsquo;s one
of the best remedies okay now does</p>
<p>anyone want to know how to get this crap
out of your body because we&rsquo;re all</p>
<p>exposed to a tremendous amount of
chemicals that they pumped in there we</p>
<p>want to talk about how to detox our
bodies specifically the endocrine system</p>
<p>okay the endocrine system your endocrine
system especially because it&rsquo;s matron</p>
<p>fat is just probably filled with
endocrine disruptors and the inner</p>
<p>constructors affect you later in life as
it breaks down and it gets in the system</p>
<p>lady come in and we worked with her and
we did very very very well with her</p>
<p>thyroid and I was working with her
doctor and she basically she was great</p>
<p>and she left and then she came back like
two months later I said what happened to</p>
<p>you she goes well is doing fine and then
I went going to detox</p>
<p>I end up with a thyroid problem yeah
because all this crap out of her liver</p>
<p>too fast it went in a blood stream in
locked up her thyroid okay</p>
<p>so you want to detox like correctly I&rsquo;m
going to show you the best type type of</p>
<p>things to do this but I want to just
mention this is a really good look on</p>
<p>the side effects of estrogen therapy and
I wanted to show you the top things that</p>
<p>are kind of ignored like the doctors say
well you just take a churchy not a</p>
<p>problem but the big thing is it causes
cancer and the big things that causes</p>
<p>strokes so not only do us trojan in your
bodies that it&rsquo;s locked up in there but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s coming from the environment coming
from chemicals okay there&rsquo;s the world</p>
<p>World Health Organization actually did a
whole bunch of research on endocrine</p>
<p>disruptors okay so I looked at through
all the research found because I said</p>
<p>why don&rsquo;t they clean scrap up it&rsquo;s
because of the EPA has an endocrine</p>
<p>disruptor subcommittee membership the
people the organization that it controls</p>
<p>endocrine disruptors are a group of
scientists that work from like Monsanto</p>
<p>Dow Chemical frito-lay Sargento
pesticide companies they&rsquo;re all involved</p>
<p>in what they&rsquo;re allowing to be safe or
not so it&rsquo;s a huge conflict of interest</p>
<p>in EPA unfortunately and this is why you
really haven&rsquo;t heard much about this</p>
<p>this is why they&rsquo;re not they&rsquo;re not
cleaning it up okay</p>
<p>look at this I have a book see this
right here this is the book on</p>
<p>toxicology the study of poisons look at
how thick it is this is all the body</p>
<p>conditions that are coming from
pesticides insecticides herbicides</p>
<p>fungicides it has every single disease
but there&rsquo;s a huge disconnect between</p>
<p>medicine
in toxicology they&rsquo;re not connecting the</p>
<p>link between cause and effect
I believe especially the cancers and a</p>
<p>lot of the other diseases are coming
from a lot of chemicals in the</p>
<p>environment it just it&rsquo;s the most
obvious now let me just make sure that I</p>
<p>answer you keep up with your questions
yeah I&rsquo;m going to get to the detox next</p>
<p>well let&rsquo;s see bring the ginger okay so
um okay teri um will be notes again</p>
<p>unfortunately I missed the beginning
yeah</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to record this I&rsquo;ll send you
the I&rsquo;m sending you this I&rsquo;ll send you</p>
<p>the notes I&rsquo;ll send you the PowerPoint
so you can go through the whole thing</p>
<p>okay let&rsquo;s talk about detoxification
this is the way that I just needed you</p>
<p>to understand like how the body can get
rid of these chemicals okay we&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to do it by to the liver there&rsquo;s
something called phase 1 phase 2</p>
<p>detoxification there&rsquo;s a series of
enzymes in your liver that are triggered</p>
<p>by certain foods but I&rsquo;m gonna highly
recommend that you they&rsquo;re of and</p>
<p>include this in your diet immediately
because this will slowly dismantle any</p>
<p>poisons that are sitting there waiting
to make turn into cancer okay so in</p>
<p>phase 1 these enzymes which is amazing
because they will convert poisons into</p>
<p>phase 2 and phase 2 basically makes
turns these fat soluble chemicals into</p>
<p>water-soluble chemicals and so that way
they can come out through the urine very</p>
<p>very safely so your body already has the
ability to get rid of these poisons</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t that cool
would anyone like to know what food that</p>
<p>this would be in fact let me just ask
you what those do you think are good to</p>
<p>detoxify
liver and the rest of the body from the</p>
<p>through the phase 1 phase 2
detoxification and as you&rsquo;re answering</p>
<p>that I notice that there&rsquo;s a question
our coffee enema is safe to use i I</p>
<p>think they&rsquo;re I think they&rsquo;re fine I
think that&rsquo;s good good way to purge the</p>
<p>liver it doesn&rsquo;t pull the chemicals out
but I think it&rsquo;s a great thing to do</p>
<p>okay kale watermelon leafy greens salads
apples beets broccoli okay good you guys</p>
<p>are sharp you&rsquo;re exactly right</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the cruciferous vegetables so let
me just touch on that um a little bit</p>
<p>cruciferous vegetables are basically
those vegetables have a cross like</p>
<p>symbol on the leaf so they&rsquo;re little
crosses on the leaves okay that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>why they call em cruciferous now they
have unique properties and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>called phytonutrients or plant chemicals
that have additional health benefits so</p>
<p>for example the radishes the red radish
is very high in a certain natural</p>
<p>chemical called sulforaphane tine sulfur
it will basically detoxify poisons that</p>
<p>trigger cancer and it will even kill
cancer on contact there&rsquo;s been Studies</p>
<p>on that so there&rsquo;s tremendous amount of
studies we&rsquo;re just not doing anything</p>
<p>with the studies okay but you can use
these foods to decrease your risk for</p>
<p>cancer even if you consume three
servings per week you can decrease</p>
<p>cancer by 40% in certain types of cancer
that&rsquo;s incredible that is unbelievable I</p>
<p>mean you should be doing it more than
three times a week but we have like the</p>
<p>kale the broccoli
Brussels sprouts and the bok choy now I</p>
<p>put some other vegetables on here as
well because those are real good</p>
<p>anti-cancer to like beet beet leaves
garlic turmeric those are really really</p>
<p>important
the chemistry of brussel sprouts</p>
<p>unbelievable anti-cancer unbelievable so
how many of you consume cruciferous</p>
<p>vegetables in your diet okay on a
regular basis and enough amounts go</p>
<p>ahead and tell me and then when I answer
a couple questions and in a very good</p>
<p>question she said now what about wait a
second we just start talking about the</p>
<p>thyroid and now we&rsquo;re actually
cruciferous and we take all these</p>
<p>cruciferous vegetables we are going to
write and with thyroids are going to</p>
<p>work right well we&rsquo;re going to actually
add more iodine and take the cruciferous</p>
<p>because the benefit of the cruciferous
for the thyroid to pull that estrogen</p>
<p>out is all we have to do is add some sea
kelp so the combination of adding seek</p>
<p>help this is a perfect mat we&rsquo;re not
just going to take what it&rsquo;s not going</p>
<p>to take straight you know cruciferous
without any extra iodine because we may</p>
<p>deplete our iodine reserves a little bit
but you&rsquo;d have to consume a lot</p>
<p>okay so Carolyn says several several
times a week hate them um I do five to</p>
<p>six cups daily um cool ok good see you
guys are when I consume seek help my</p>
<p>throat feels swollen that could be
because either the sea kelp is toxic</p>
<p>which a lot of times if you take seek
help from a polluted ocean a lot of</p>
<p>extra heavy metals and chemicals that
are very very reactive</p>
<p>your thyroid I use a type of sea kelp
that&rsquo;s from Iceland it&rsquo;s or certified</p>
<p>organic I&rsquo;ve never had a rare actually
it works really really good lie too</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to give you some solutions so
I&rsquo;m going to talk about the ovary kit</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry estrogen kit like some of you
are asking about the ovary and and at</p>
<p>these webinars I always give you guys a
little discount but here&rsquo;s the thing a</p>
<p>lot of times it&rsquo;s hard to find work
consumed the amount of cruciferous in</p>
<p>the diet in the range of different types
of Christopher&rsquo;s foods so I use the</p>
<p>Chris whole cruciferous food combined
with the organic sea kelp together and I</p>
<p>recommend that you would do um between
three and six cruciferous and to organic</p>
<p>seek help in the morning now why do you
do this in the morning</p>
<p>specifically the sea kelp because if you
take seek out before bed it will wake</p>
<p>you up it&rsquo;ll make you very very awake in
your brain because it activates mental</p>
<p>alertness so it&rsquo;s really good to take in
the morning you don&rsquo;t actually need</p>
<p>massive amounts of sea kelp the morning
is totally fine okay now if you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have a thyroid maybe you take an extra
if you have five or cystic breasts you</p>
<p>can take extra okay now the ovary
support that I have supports a low</p>
<p>thyroid and a high thyroid and a lot of
you that I I&rsquo;m recognizing you from my</p>
<p>membership site are already taking the
ovary support basically no resupport</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a combination of herbal
ingredients that support estrogen to</p>
<p>balance it out and glandular extracts
for the ovary for the pituitary and for</p>
<p>the adrenal so let&rsquo;s see it&rsquo;s the best
thing for a menopausal supplement and</p>
<p>also from PMS so if you would ask me
what do I do for PMS or ovary problem I</p>
<p>give the ovary support okay so if anyone
wants to have this kid I&rsquo;ll just post it</p>
<p>right now let me just give it to you
okay</p>
<p>so so this kit is basically designed to
clean up the endocrine disruptors and</p>
<p>give you enough iodine and also support
the ovary if you don&rsquo;t have an ovary</p>
<p>then or ovaries then you definitely want
to take this too because it kind of</p>
<p>supplies the raw material for the body
that your whatever you&rsquo;re missing</p>
<p>basically okay now what if you&rsquo;re a male
body I do have a solution for that but</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to first answer some questions
someone&rsquo;s saying what about dim for</p>
<p>estrogen dominance now dim is extract of
a cruciferous vegetable and I found that</p>
<p>dim is is is actually very effective but
my thought is why not take the actual</p>
<p>vegetable itself because dim is one
extract one just one cruciferous food</p>
<p>would have over 600 different types of
phytonutrients so it&rsquo;s very very very</p>
<p>more complex than just one one
individual phytonutrients called dim and</p>
<p>so I liked them but I would recommend
all of the cruciferous together if you</p>
<p>had a choice does the wheatgrass have
seek help in it no it doesn&rsquo;t but the</p>
<p>the whole crew surfers food does have
some seek help in it okay now if you</p>
<p>guys get this kit um within today or
tomorrow I&rsquo;m also going to send you my</p>
<p>acupressure technique for the ovary now
what is that how what can you do the</p>
<p>ovary and this technique is already in
my membership site so if you&rsquo;re in the</p>
<p>membership site you probably already
have seen it however I&rsquo;m going to just</p>
<p>get it with anyone who gets this kit and
if you&rsquo;re a male body you&rsquo;re not going</p>
<p>to need this but it&rsquo;s mainly to help
support and ovary that is been damaged</p>
<p>or a menstrual cycle that is altered or
a problem with the ovaries of the uterus</p>
<p>okay any problems whether it&rsquo;s a fibroid
a heavy period hot flashes you can use</p>
<p>this technique and the reason why
developed a technique is to because it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very difficult to find any type of
acupressure techniques for the ovary so</p>
<p>I developed it over a long period of
time and it&rsquo;s very very effective it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>great way to do a demonstration at a
seminar because it works very fast you</p>
<p>can see changes especially if someone&rsquo;s
like depressed that time of the month</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;re having happy period you can
see changes immediately if you do the</p>
<p>technique because an average female has
over 400 mental cycles in their lifetime</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s 400 traumas to the uterus and the
ovaries not to mention if they had</p>
<p>pregnancies miscarriages abortions all
that trauma needs to be cleared up the</p>
<p>tech you acupressure technique fixes the
trauma from the female organs okay</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what it fixes because when you
have this trauma you lose your</p>
<p>communication lines to that area of the
body and it starts to become out of</p>
<p>balance okay and yes it would help you
with an ovarian cyst</p>
<p>I took a lady who had a cyst the size of
a lemon on ultrasound and we did the</p>
<p>technique and within three days it went
away all of our pelvis that was kind of</p>
<p>rotated came back and she felt there all
her back pain went away a lot of times</p>
<p>the pain for from an ovary will cause
sacroiliac pain in the back of like</p>
<p>either the right or left side of your
lower back</p>
<p>okay um it was asking question about
fibroids fibroids are primarily an</p>
<p>excess estrogen problem the same thing
is over insist this is too much estrogen</p>
<p>so you need to number one
make sure you do the diet that lowers</p>
<p>insulin for sure okay because insulin
can also make things get bigger make</p>
<p>sure you&rsquo;re doing a lot of cruciferous
vegetables because that is the thing</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to shrink it okay and also
iodine iodine will shrink it too but I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>just giving a solution for a food base
how much iodine should be considered if</p>
<p>one has the fibroid of the uterus I
don&rsquo;t like to recommend individual</p>
<p>milligrams of iodine
I recommend more of a seat count because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a food based complex with all the
minerals with a heavy amount of iodine</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s in a plant base so I would
recommend for a fibroid I would</p>
<p>recommend six seek help a day but
consume before lunch okay if you have</p>
<p>fibroids you have indigestion with
cruciferous vegetables especially</p>
<p>broccoli like I do which by the way is
the reason why I took out broccoli out</p>
<p>of the cruciferous because it was
creating problems for myself and I</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t had many problems that have with
people taking this blend umm because I</p>
<p>took out the broccoli but if you if you
are very sensitive then you&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>have to consume like steamed them cook
them or have other vegetables like</p>
<p>spinach or kale is pretty safe for
people okay um did you say these</p>
<p>supplements have wheatgrass in it no
these C supplements do not have any leak</p>
<p>rest and by the way we cress does not
have gluten there&rsquo;s no gluten in wheat</p>
<p>grass how much iodine let&rsquo;s see how many
whole cruciferous do you recommend a day</p>
<p>I recommend between 3 and 6 if you don&rsquo;t
have a problem and you want to do a</p>
<p>preventative do 3 do 3 a day I mean
that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s one tablet is equivalent</p>
<p>to one serving so you&rsquo;re going to be
protect your going to protect your body</p>
<p>your breasts your tissues over a period
of time if you did it every day it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>great protective thing how can I
overcome the effects of history</p>
<p>hysterectomy a gallbladder removal
well you&rsquo;re going to have to support the</p>
<p>adrenals and you&rsquo;re going to have to UM
probably take a little bile from the</p>
<p>gallbladder X formula to help help the
liver detoxify a little bit better</p>
<p>does your kale shakes count um they
count a little bit but it&rsquo;s you need to</p>
<p>take it&rsquo;s probably you&rsquo;re going to have
if you added the kale shake with the</p>
<p>kale and made a shake I think that would
be a really good thing to do okay but</p>
<p>the cruciferous must be organic
if you that&rsquo;s a good question should the</p>
<p>cruciferous be organic now all of the
vegetables that I&rsquo;m recommending in this</p>
<p>product are organic but it&rsquo;s sometimes
it&rsquo;s hard to find organic so if you</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t find organic it&rsquo;s much better to
consume any cruciferous than no</p>
<p>cruciferous okay
um I really like green beans any</p>
<p>benefits from this vegetables yeah so if
you have green beans from a garden um</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s great benefits especially in the
flavonoids and vitamin C complex</p>
<p>what if you get a migraine on the third
day of your period that almost every</p>
<p>single time
that&rsquo;s estrogen dominance okay what</p>
<p>percentage of the kale shake is kale um
the kale shake my instant kale shake has</p>
<p>this basement serving size and there&rsquo;s
there&rsquo;s like one cup of kale per serving</p>
<p>size per scoop of that kale okay what is
bile and what does it do and yes I do</p>
<p>have a bile in a product called gall
bladder formula which by the way is out</p>
<p>for another two weeks unfortunately
because it&rsquo;s a very popular thing but</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll get it in two weeks but you just
take one after you eat</p>
<p>it helps you convert the thyroid hormone
it helps you digest it&rsquo;s help helps you</p>
<p>up for bloating it helps you absorb
vitamin A for the eyes mented</p>
<p>cruciferous food okay I think it&rsquo;s
awesome yes it&rsquo;s totally fine I</p>
<p>understand cranberries are higher in
iodine but they&rsquo;re high in fructose yes</p>
<p>they are high in sugar that&rsquo;s why I
don&rsquo;t recommend getting your iodine from</p>
<p>that any more than I&rsquo;d recommend getting
potassium from bananas someone says said</p>
<p>pink pancreatin that&rsquo;s an enzyme for the
pancreas that&rsquo;s actually in the crew of</p>
<p>the gall bladder formula bile is
different than pancreatic bile is from</p>
<p>the gall bladder pink random pancreatin
is the enzyme from the from the pancreas</p>
<p>okay how long will it take to see
progress with seek help on fibroids I</p>
<p>think if you did everything correct and
you really follow my eating plan for the</p>
<p>insulin resistance you would start
seeing change within a couple weeks okay</p>
<p>more probably more change after a month
because these these natural the seek</p>
<p>help and the cruciferous they work
slowly and you don&rsquo;t want to pull these</p>
<p>chemicals out too fast because it&rsquo;s too
toxic um let&rsquo;s see I wish I would have</p>
<p>known this before having hysterectomy I
know I know they really push those</p>
<p>things I have gas from eating broccoli I
know it it just tears me up so avoid</p>
<p>broccoli our steam brought Brussels
sprouts good absolutely yes it&rsquo;s very</p>
<p>very good now someone asked what about
men for testosterone okay there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>another kit that for them and that&rsquo;s
slightly different I&rsquo;m adding something</p>
<p>called DHA DHA is a healthy fat that um
basically supports the testicle so it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the testicle the raw material okay so
there&rsquo;s a little kit there for men that</p>
<p>have low testosterone because what we&rsquo;re
going to do is we&rsquo;re going to lower</p>
<p>estrogen thereby increasing testosterone
the DHA is really good also for</p>
<p>increasing testosterone it feeds the the
test of the testicle food for it to</p>
<p>manufacture more hormone okay so that&rsquo;s
the testosterone kit okay</p>
<p>can you just stop HRT you know I can&rsquo;t
tell you to stop anything but just</p>
<p>between you and me and the four walls
even though we&rsquo;re doing a live webinar</p>
<p>here I do not think there&rsquo;s any problem
with stopping it too fast as long as you</p>
<p>you can support the underlying root
cause again I didn&rsquo;t tell you to come</p>
<p>off of it I&rsquo;m just saying that I don&rsquo;t
think there is a problem um what about</p>
<p>oxalates if you have oxalates high
oxalates you need to be consuming a</p>
<p>lemon juice okay lemon juice or a lemon
in your water every single day okay that</p>
<p>will handle that sylvia says will the
discount be automatically deductible</p>
<p>warning it when ordering the estrogen
kit yes it automatically is abducted you</p>
<p>click the link and then it will
automatically UM take it off it&rsquo;ll be on</p>
<p>the right column you&rsquo;ll see it but it&rsquo;s
10% off if you wanted to get it within</p>
<p>the next 24 hours okay so what if I try
the adrenal package first not a problem</p>
<p>around you can do that totally fine um
in the adrenal kit let me think</p>
<p>okay okay nevermind um let&rsquo;s see here
where can I find a diet for estrogen</p>
<p>dominance</p>
<p>what if if I take estrogen kit with
cruciferous vegetables should I follow</p>
<p>the keto diet plan yes you should follow
the keto diet plan because you want to</p>
<p>keep insulin low and I have a lot of
videos on what to eat what diet you</p>
<p>should be on let me just see here let me
just see if I can read that to also take</p>
<p>an insulin kit no you don&rsquo;t take an
instant kit you just need to follow the</p>
<p>eating plan that I recommend to lower
insulin my sister has epilepsy and the</p>
<p>only time she has seizures let&rsquo;s see was
medication levels are low seizures are</p>
<p>related to insulin so if you go on a low
insulin diet it&rsquo;s called a ketogenic</p>
<p>that is wonderful for the brain and that
also epilepsy yeah so check it out</p>
<p>ketogenic diet did we get potassium from
you know it&rsquo;s interesting you said that</p>
<p>because one of the best sources is seek
help you have a lot of potassium in seek</p>
<p>out but also from leafy greens you need
between 7 and 10 cups all right you see</p>
<p>here do you have the cruciferous foods
doc yes yes and I know if your</p>
<p>backordered we&rsquo;ve been sending it out
ASAP we just got it in we have tons of</p>
<p>it yes it&rsquo;s being shipped out you should
get it any day now Sheila um ok so to</p>
<p>answer that question is drinking
six to seven or five to six kale shakes</p>
<p>too much not if you&rsquo;re doing this seek
help and not if you&rsquo;re there to counter</p>
<p>any possible oxalate stones okay what if
someone&rsquo;s very high progesterone in the</p>
<p>very low estrogen then I would increase
your estrogen by maybe a non-gmo tempeh</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a fermented soy that might give you
a little more estrogen support the over</p>
<p>with over a complex or a resupport
because that actually gets your own body</p>
<p>produce more am I getting enough DHEA
taking cotton oil sometimes you are but</p>
<p>make sure Lane the colorant where you&rsquo;re
taking is virgin cod liver oil don&rsquo;t get</p>
<p>the regular cod liver oil is your
cruciferous product raw</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s basically under a heating like 106
degrees but it&rsquo;s not completely</p>
<p>classified as raw but the enzymes are
active pretty active but it&rsquo;s I can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>make a claim that it&rsquo;s wrong but it&rsquo;s
organic how can I relieve restless legs</p>
<p>that drive me crazy that&rsquo;s a B vitamin
deficiency and adrenal deficiency so the</p>
<p>best thing for restless legs is the
adrenal de handle it within a day mmm I</p>
<p>take we cross daily does it contain
potassium it can it contains a lot of</p>
<p>potassium a ton do you have anything for
toe pain and toe cramp that gets worse</p>
<p>while walking or taking d3 yes you need
to take k2 to transport the calcium also</p>
<p>you need more potassium and then the
third thing is you do acupressure on the</p>
<p>opposite toe so for example a big toe
you massage the left big toe okay that</p>
<p>should get rid of your pain does taking
K to increase estrogen since it&rsquo;s from</p>
<p>NATO not at all minor minor minor amount
of NATO it&rsquo;s not filled with estrogen</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not going to be a problem
have one ovary take of your support the</p>
<p>ovary support it really depends if you
have symptoms like hot flashes you take</p>
<p>three to four bed if it&rsquo;s during the day
take three during the day I would</p>
<p>recommend taking three for a while and
no maintenance but you&rsquo;ll see that over</p>
<p>support creates some really cool effects
for females because of the amount of</p>
<p>issues they have with the ovary find
something that supports and over that</p>
<p>produces too much estrogen and not
enough it actually balances it out is</p>
<p>there anything that isn&rsquo;t in pill form I
only have the wheatgrass but you could</p>
<p>just open up the capsules and pour it
into something someone said they did the</p>
<p>active pressure on the gall bladder it
was inflamed if you have an inflamed</p>
<p>gone all the other of Karen you want you
don&rsquo;t want to work on the goal that or</p>
<p>directly you want to work on the
opposite side beside and that will help</p>
<p>because you want to treat it like an
injury work on the opposite side what</p>
<p>our oxalates there are chemicals that
form calcium stones so they bind to</p>
<p>calcium and they form stones and that
can come from the cruciferous have a</p>
<p>like enough lemon in the diet so lemon
is a really good thing to add in your</p>
<p>water is it possible to get rid of
thyroid nodules you don&rsquo;t merck manual</p>
<p>major medical books that you study in
pre-med um back in 1850 um they used</p>
<p>iodine to cure thyroid nodules and all
tumors back then but mysteriously they</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t recommend that anymore because of
course is no profit in it for nodules is</p>
<p>the iodine deficiency I know they just
do biopsies and they don&rsquo;t give you the</p>
<p>highlight is crazy like this with the
adrenal day and night promo sure</p>
<p>Robert improving testosterone I
recommend doing that kind of a</p>
<p>cruciferous and the sea kelp for that
I have polyps and fibroids any natural</p>
<p>forms of birth control besides condoms
that will worse my fibroids there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>something called the lady cue stick now
you&rsquo;re going to laugh because the lady</p>
<p>q-tip is $25 on Amazon and you can put
saliva on it look up into the light and</p>
<p>determine if you&rsquo;re fertile or not
fertile and I&rsquo;ll have a different like a</p>
<p>fern kind of pattern and if you&rsquo;re not
fertile let&rsquo;s see if you&rsquo;re not fertile</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll have little specks so they&rsquo;ll tell
you when you&rsquo;re the most fertile and</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re not so you can kind of use
that to know if you the problem is</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s always that small chance that
you might be fertile when you know so</p>
<p>but they offer a money-back guarantee
you can get your twenty five dollars</p>
<p>back okay um it&rsquo;s true but I&rsquo;m having
them have it dry sensing here alright</p>
<p>the other thing with birth control pills
and this is a really because what do you</p>
<p>do what do you do if you don&rsquo;t want to
use condoms</p>
<p>you have to use birth control I mean
it&rsquo;s I don&rsquo;t really have a solution for</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t um unfortunately because
your you know it&rsquo;s yours kit others pros</p>
<p>and cons like because the birth control
pills have so many side effects down the</p>
<p>road it&rsquo;s an issue okay I&rsquo;m a mixed body
type I already dream on what kid is best</p>
<p>start with the adrenal because the
thyroid is usually secondary okay I have</p>
<p>too much calcium I&rsquo;m in my blood that
means you need to stop taking vitamin D</p>
<p>and take k2 only
cows you from the blood okay so someone</p>
<p>says Karen says she has the tool yes sir
are using the tube massage tool that</p>
<p>will help you to sleep ah let&rsquo;s see dr.
Berg let&rsquo;s see here okay so if any of</p>
<p>you make questions like the last seminar
you want the notes who you want the</p>
<p>webinar replay you can just call my
office and get it his Parkinson&rsquo;s</p>
<p>related estrogen dominance no it&rsquo;s
related to insulin dominance is have you</p>
<p>dropped the super nutrients yes I did
because a lot of the ingredients are in</p>
<p>the weak rests so my my wheatgrass is my
new super nutrients how much K is in in</p>
<p>the wheatgrass juice there&rsquo;s actually a
lot of vitamin K and that&rsquo;s the problem</p>
<p>with people that are included which is
oh let&rsquo;s see here if you&rsquo;re taking a</p>
<p>blood thinner and have low potassium I
would start taking vitamin k2 and a lot</p>
<p>of them because they&rsquo;ll help but last a
minute do you assume that if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>eating got a lot of cruciferous that you
have high oxalates chances are yes you</p>
<p>have high oxalates so just in case start
chopping down on the lemons this nato</p>
<p>from k2 increase estrogen hardly at all
it&rsquo;s not gonna be a problem I have one</p>
<p>over uh I have one over three how many
seek help and ovary support should I</p>
<p>take I would take to seek help in the
morning three ovary support these stones</p>
<p>then you need lemon juice my doctor
prescribed Lugar&rsquo;s iodine for cystic</p>
<p>Burress well that will work
to take it in a complex because they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>plant-based minerals and they seem to
work very very well so I have no desire</p>
<p>to take a individual elemental liquid
item or all your products safe to take</p>
<p>when taking synthroid absolutely because
they&rsquo;re just food base that&rsquo;s why I like</p>
<p>them they&rsquo;re not synthetic anything do
anything for foot pain have videos on</p>
<p>foot pain you should do a search with
dr. bird anything for Parkinson&rsquo;s yeah</p>
<p>do the lower the estrogen in the diet I
only have one adrenal support the other</p>
<p>adrenal can I take over support well on
the Lupron absolutely um menopause if a</p>
<p>minim paused is supporting ovary belly
fat no it helps you lose fat around the</p>
<p>hips in the in the lower pitch in the
stomach</p>
<p>we crest harvest at what point in time
how long was lee crest growing yeah it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>seasonal and that&rsquo;s why i have to order
it urine in advance because it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>seasonal and i can if you want to email
me I can give you specifics on that um</p>
<p>need to lose 35 pounds should I start
with the adrenal kit um Rob I would</p>
<p>start with the adrenal kit if you
primarily wanted to lose weight fast</p>
<p>drunken testosterone is mainly
specifically for testosterone not</p>
<p>necessarily weight loss
I had an ablation of the uterus is it</p>
<p>okay to take oh yeah then you that&rsquo;s a
trauma so you need to do the ovaries</p>
<p>formula and also the over a technique
will send it to you via email which dad</p>
<p>should I fell from the insulin diet or
the adrenal diet you need to do the</p>
<p>adrenals that because there&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s
included that think in that diet you</p>
<p>know show you how lower insulin as you
see I&rsquo;m going real fast release I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>trying to answer more questions this
time um sounds going in and out well I</p>
<p>will send you the replay on this
for three years is there a chance my</p>
<p>diary can recover yeah absolutely I&rsquo;ve
had people and synthroid for the 20</p>
<p>years come off that stuff so the thyroid
can bounce back nicely anything for</p>
<p>Hashimoto&rsquo;s I would I would do the the
protocol for the estrogen protocol for</p>
<p>Hashimoto&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s what I would
recommend um all in how many days to</p>
<p>heal PCOS with a keto and keto diet I
think it&rsquo;s gonna happen pretty fast</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll start seeing changes probably
within a week or two um okay so someone</p>
<p>about orders if you have any questions
you just call my office tomorrow um I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>been taking the adrenal night formula I
dream more but I still wake still wake</p>
<p>restful oh you&rsquo;re asking I still wake
restful how does the adrenal night work</p>
<p>it basically relaxes the adrenal so you
can get into a deeper Delta wave sleep</p>
<p>seek help even when taking sin through
it yes you can please the need for synth</p>
<p>right over time but it won&rsquo;t be a spike
because in a food base alright okay up I</p>
<p>hit my hour-and-a-half limit here so I
want to thank you guys again for</p>
<p>listening this long I appreciate your
attention great questions thanks for</p>
<p>your interest um some additional the
powerpoints for anyone who&rsquo;s on here and</p>
<p>if you have any questions go ahead and
email us and stay tuned for next</p>
<p>week we&rsquo;re going to do this again I&rsquo;m
going to talk about a different set of</p>
<p>hormones okay so have a great week and I
