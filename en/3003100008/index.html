<p>Tim: Good morning!</p>
<p>Welcome back to Apple Park for our second event</p>
<p>in just over a month.</p>
<p>At Apple, we are focused on creating innovative products</p>
<p>and experiences,</p>
<p>products that offer our users new ways to express their creativity</p>
<p>and to enjoy the creativity of others.</p>
<p>So today, we&rsquo;re focusing on two important areas:</p>
<p>music and the Mac.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with music.</p>
<p>Music plays such an important part in our lives.</p>
<p>It has the power to inspire, lift us up, and bring us together.</p>
<p>Apple has forever changed the way people listen to and discover music.</p>
<p>And we continue to make it better.</p>
<p>Our deep integration of hardware, software, and services lets you enjoy</p>
<p>a seamless music experience with amazing sound quality on all of your devices.</p>
<p>AirPods are one of the most popular music products we&rsquo;ve ever created.</p>
<p>Combined with the revolutionary iPhone, they bring an industry-leading,</p>
<p>wireless music experience wherever you go.</p>
<p>Our powerful Mac and iPad multi-speaker sound systems</p>
<p>bring incredible audio to any space.</p>
<p>HomePod mini is the best way to enjoy your music throughout your home.</p>
<p>Apple Watch is a fantastic way to enjoy music right from your wrist,</p>
<p>providing the soundtrack you need to stay active and fit.</p>
<p>And, of course, there&rsquo;s Apple Music, which has over 90 million songs</p>
<p>and 30 thousand curated playlists in its global catalogue.</p>
<p>This fall, we&rsquo;re taking the Apple Music experience even further,</p>
<p>and here&rsquo;s Zane to tell you more.</p>
<p>[upbeat music]</p>
<p>Zane: Today, Apple Music and Siri deliver an effortless music experience</p>
<p>that lets you hear pretty much anything you want</p>
<p>by using just your voice.</p>
<p>Already you can ask for your favorite songs, albums, or artists,</p>
<p>but there are also times when you want to find just the right music</p>
<p>for the moment, and we want to make Siri more helpful with that.</p>
<p>So our music experts have created new playlists</p>
<p>for hundreds of moods and activities.</p>
<p>Now if you ask Siri to put on a playlist for your dinner party,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll hear the perfect selection from Leon Bridges.</p>
<p>When you want to relax before bed,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a playlist for winding down,</p>
<p>featuring one of my favorite artists, Nils Frahm.</p>
<p>[classical piano music]</p>
<p>And when you need that extra push</p>
<p>to take you further on your next hike,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll need The Weeknd&rsquo;s &ldquo;Take My Breath.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These new playlists are available to every subscriber</p>
<p>and make using Apple Music together with Siri even easier</p>
<p>and better.</p>
<p>Naturally, we want to bring this experience</p>
<p>to more people than ever before,</p>
<p>so today, we&rsquo;re excited to also introduce</p>
<p>a brand-new subscription plan for Apple Music,</p>
<p>the Voice plan.</p>
<p>With this new plan, use only your voice</p>
<p>and the power of Siri to access every song,</p>
<p>every playlist, and every station in Apple Music</p>
<p>across all your Apple devices, for just $4.99 a month.</p>
<p>This plan will be available starting in 17 countries and regions</p>
<p>later this fall.</p>
<p>Now everyone has three great ways to get Apple Music.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the Individual plan, the Family plan,</p>
<p>and now the Voice plan,</p>
<p>where you can use the power of Siri</p>
<p>to access the full Apple Music catalogue.</p>
<p>This is Apple Music.</p>
<p>Back to Tim.</p>
<p>Tim: We&rsquo;re excited that even more people will be able</p>
<p>to enjoy Apple Music simply with their voice.</p>
<p>With access to virtually any song you want to hear,</p>
<p>as well as expertly crafted playlists that are perfect for any occasion,</p>
<p>Apple Music truly has something for everyone.</p>
<p>And one of the best ways to experience it is with HomePod mini.</p>
<p>To tell you more, here&rsquo;s Dave.</p>
<p>[upbeat music]</p>

<p>Dave: Get Siri&rsquo;s help with all kinds of things,</p>
<p>like creating a reminder to get what you need for your latest hobby.</p>
<p>Hey, Siri, set a reminder to buy wood glue.</p>
<p>Siri: Okay, Jordan, added to reminders.</p>
<p>[upbeat music]</p>
<p>‚ô™ ‚ô™</p>
<p>Dave: And rally everyone to the table with Intercom,</p>
<p>without raising your voice.</p>
<p>Hey, Siri, tell everyone lunch is ready.</p>
<p>Siri: [tone] Lunch is ready.</p>
<p>‚ô™ ‚ô™</p>
<p>Dave: We can&rsquo;t wait for you to enjoy these incredible experiences</p>
<p>and beautiful colors in your home.</p>
<p>These new colors join white and space gray</p>
<p>and will be available for just $99 starting in November.</p>
<p>Now back to Tim.</p>
<p>[upbeat music]</p>
<p>‚ô™ ‚ô™</p>
<p>Tim: HomePod mini will look great in even more places around your home,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a fantastic way to enjoy Apple Music.</p>
<p>When it comes to listening to music on the go,</p>
<p>AirPods deliver a magical wireless experience.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ve become the most popular headphones in the world.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got some exciting news about AirPods,</p>
<p>and here&rsquo;s Susmita to tell you more.</p>
<p>[bombastic music]</p>
<p>Susmita: Our users love listening to music with AirPods,</p>
<p>and with spatial audio featuring Dolby Atmos in Apple Music,</p>
<p>AirPods have never sounded better.</p>
<p>[light music playing]</p>
<p>By moving music beyond the simple left and right of traditional stereo sound</p>
<p>and into three-dimensional immersive listening,</p>
<p>spatial audio embeds you deeper into the mix than ever before.</p>
<p>[trippy electronic music]</p>
<p>‚ô™ ‚ô™</p>
<p>Spatial audio brings music to life,</p>
<p>with sounds that surround you</p>
<p>to create something truly multidimensional.</p>
<p>‚ô™ ‚ô™</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a whole new way to experience your favorite music.</p>
<p>Every day, top artists like James Blake and Doja Cat</p>
<p>are releasing more songs in Dolby Atmos.</p>
<p>Spatial audio goes beyond music.</p>
<p>When watching TV shows and movies,</p>
<p>it enables an immersive theater-like experience,</p>
<p>placing you right in the middle of the action.</p>
<p>You can enjoy spatial audio with dynamic head tracking</p>
<p>on AirPods Pro and AirPods Max</p>
<p>across all of your devices</p>
<p>from iPhone to iPad, to Apple TV and Mac.</p>
<p>We want to bring the full spatial audio experience</p>
<p>to even more of our customers,</p>
<p>so today we are excited to announce</p>
<p>the third generation of our most popular AirPods.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look.</p>
<p>[upbeat music]</p>
<p>‚ô™ ‚ô™</p>
<p>‚ô™ ‚ô™</p>
<p>‚ô™ ‚ô™</p>
<p>‚ô™ ‚ô™</p>
<p>These are the new AirPods with spatial audio,</p>
<p>featuring an all new design inside and out</p>
<p>with a force sensor</p>
<p>for more control of your music and phone calls.</p>
<p>To deliver the best sound quality,</p>
<p>we designed a brand new low-distortion driver</p>
<p>created just for the new AirPods</p>
<p>to provide powerful bass</p>
<p>and crisp, clean high frequencies</p>
<p>whether you&rsquo;re relaxing to Yo Yo Ma</p>
<p>or singing along to Lizzo.</p>
<p>And to keep your music going during your toughest workouts</p>
<p>or a jog in the rain,</p>
<p>the next generation AirPods are sweat and water resistant.</p>
<p>Since everyone&rsquo;s ear shape is unique,</p>
<p>what you hear can be different</p>
<p>from what you&rsquo;re intended to hear.</p>
<p>We wanted to find a way to make sure</p>
<p>everyone has the best audio experience possible.</p>
<p>And we achieved this in two ways.</p>
<p>First, with our new contoured design,</p>
<p>that delivers sound directly to your ears.</p>
<p>Second, with Adaptive EQ,</p>
<p>a breakthrough feature in sound</p>
<p>that we first made available with the AirPods Pro.</p>
<p>Adaptive EQ provides the best audio experience</p>
<p>customized for you in real time</p>
<p>by adjusting frequencies in the sound</p>
<p>to match what you are hearing to how it&rsquo;s supposed to be heard,</p>
<p>so you can listen to Olivia Rodrigo&rsquo;s latest album just the way she intended.</p>
<p>The magical experience of AirPods makes it effortless</p>
<p>to enjoy your music throughout the day.</p>
<p>It begins the moment you open the case</p>
<p>with the one-touch setup</p>
<p>that automatically pairs to all of your Apple devices,</p>
<p>making AirPods always ready when you are.</p>
<p>And to extend your experience,</p>
<p>we increased the battery life</p>
<p>for up to six hours of listening time.</p>
<p>Or if you&rsquo;re in a hurry, five minutes of charge time</p>
<p>gets you around an hour of use.</p>
<p>And of course, the convenience of the charging case,</p>
<p>giving you an additional four full charges</p>
<p>for up to 30 hours of total listening time.</p>
<p>To make charging your AirPods even more convenient,</p>
<p>we added MagSafe and wireless charging to the case.</p>
<p>These are the new AirPods</p>
<p>featuring spatial audio with dynamic head tracking,</p>
<p>an all new design,</p>
<p>our custom designed driver with Adaptive EQ,</p>
<p>and the magical experience that our customers love.</p>
<p>We took the best-selling headphones in the world</p>
<p>and made them even better.</p>
<p>All of this for $179.</p>
<p>We will start taking orders today,</p>
<p>and they will be available next week.</p>
<p>The next generation AirPods</p>
<p>join the world&rsquo;s most popular family of headphones.</p>
<p>This is our new AirPods lineup,</p>
<p>starting at just $129.</p>
<p>Now back to Tim.</p>
<p>‚ô™ ‚ô™</p>
<p>Tim: We can‚Äôt wait for you to try the next generation of AirPods,</p>
<p>and with this great lineup, there is something for everyone.</p>
<p>Now let‚Äôs talk about the Mac.</p>
<p>The Mac has always been an easy to use yet incredibly capable tool</p>
<p>that empowers users to create in new and innovative ways.</p>
<p>The tight integration of hardware and software</p>
<p>provides a user experience that is simply unrivaled.</p>
<p>And with Apple silicon, that experience is better than ever.</p>
<p>We‚Äôre a year into a two-year transition, which started with M1,</p>
<p>our first chip designed specifically for the Mac.</p>
<p>M1 is a breakthrough.</p>
<p>It has transformed our most popular and affordable systems,</p>
<p>redefining what they can do with incredible performance</p>
<p>and extraordinary battery life.</p>
<p>The response has been off the charts.</p>
<p>M1 has propelled Mac growth over the past year,</p>
<p>outpacing the industry with the Mac having its best year ever.</p>
<p>And today I‚Äôm thrilled that we‚Äôre bringing Apple silicon to even more systems.</p>
<p>To tell you all about it, here‚Äôs John.</p>
<p>[upbeat music]</p>
<p>‚ô™ ‚ô™</p>
<p>John: Our pro users rely on the Mac,</p>
<p>and the one they choose most is the MacBook Pro.</p>
<p>They choose it to develop amazing apps that enrich people‚Äôs lives,</p>
<p>to create music that moves us,</p>
<p>and to make movies and shows that entertain and educate us.</p>
<p>The MacBook Pro appeals to people who want the most powerful Mac notebook,</p>
<p>so they can change the world.</p>
<p>Well, today is the day that they&rsquo;ve been waiting for.</p>
<p>Because today, we‚Äôre completely reimagining MacBook Pro.</p>
<p>And it starts with the first pro chip designed for the Mac.</p>
<p>[upbeat music]</p>
<p>[loud whooshing]</p>
<p>[upbeat electronic music]</p>
<p>‚ô™ ‚ô™</p>
<p>This is M1 Pro,</p>
<p>the next chip in the M1 family.</p>
<p>And it‚Äôs a game changer.</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s hand it over to Johny for a deep dive</p>
<p>into this remarkable new chip.</p>
<p>‚ô™ ‚ô™</p>
<p>Johny: The transition to Apple silicon</p>
<p>is all about bringing its incredible performance,</p>
<p>custom technologies, and relentless focus on power efficiency to the Mac.</p>
<p>And M1 has done exactly that.</p>
<p>Not only has it transformed our most popular systems,</p>
<p>it has shocked the PC world.</p>
<p>M1 has been amazing for so many of our customers.</p>
<p>However, there are some pro users who need even more.</p>
<p>And we wanted to build something great just for them.</p>
<p>That is what M1 Pro is all about.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs our next breakthrough chip for the Mac.</p>
<p>Now, building a pro laptop has meant using a power-hungry CPU</p>
<p>and discrete GPU.</p>
<p>But a two-chip architecture requires much more power and cooling.</p>
<p>It also means the CPU and GPU have separate pools of memory,</p>
<p>so they have to copy data back and forth over a slower interface.</p>
<p>No one has ever applied a system-on-a-chip design to a pro system, until today.</p>
<p>And we did this by scaling up M1‚Äôs groundbreaking architecture</p>
<p>to create a far more powerful chip with M1 Pro.</p>
<p>We started by rearchitecting the chip fabric to enable the SoC to scale,</p>
<p>while doubling the width of the memory interface,</p>
<p>and using faster DRAM.</p>
<p>This lets M1 Pro deliver up to 200 gigabytes per second of memory bandwidth,</p>
<p>nearly three times M1.</p>
<p>And its custom package supports up to 32 gigabytes of unified memory.</p>
<p>The M1 Pro die is built using the industry-leading</p>
<p>5 nanometer process technology</p>
<p>and features a massive 33.7 billion transistors.</p>
<p>That‚Äôs more than twice M1.</p>
<p>All those transistors deliver even more performance,</p>
<p>starting with a 10-core CPU</p>
<p>with 8 high-performance cores and 2 high-efficiency cores,</p>
<p>delivering up to 70% faster CPU performance than M1.</p>
<p>For graphics, M1 Pro features 16 GPU cores,</p>
<p>8 more than M1.</p>
<p>These additional cores, along with increased memory bandwidth,</p>
<p>give M1 Pro up to two times faster graphics performance than M1.</p>
<p>M1 Pro has our industry-leading media engine</p>
<p>that accelerates video processing while using very little power.</p>
<p>And now it pushes even further with ProRes.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs one of the highest quality codecs in professional video production.</p>
<p>Adding ProRes acceleration enables M1 Pro to play multiple streams</p>
<p>of 4K and 8K ProRes video</p>
<p>while using just a fraction of the power.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs another key advantage of building our own silicon.</p>
<p>And finally, M1 Pro includes other advanced technologies</p>
<p>for a complete pro system.</p>
<p>Like a powerful engine to drive multiple displays</p>
<p>and additional Thunderbolt controllers to deliver even more I/O bandwidth</p>
<p>and so much more.</p>
<p>So that‚Äôs M1 Pro.</p>
<p>Building on the M1 architecture,</p>
<p>M1 Pro takes the amazing performance of Apple silicon to a whole new level.</p>
<p>M1 Pro is unlike anything else in a pro computer.</p>
<p>Yet we wanted to push the performance of Apple silicon even further.</p>
<p>So today we‚Äôre launching not one, but two new chips for the Mac.</p>
<p>[dramatic music]</p>
<p>‚ô™ ‚ô™</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m thrilled to introduce M1 Max.</p>
<p>This incredible chip builds on M1 Pro</p>
<p>and takes its amazing capabilities to new heights.</p>
<p>M1 Max starts with a much higher-bandwidth on-chip fabric,</p>
<p>and doubles the memory interface once again.</p>
<p>This delivers up to 400 gigabytes per second of memory bandwidth.</p>
<p>That‚Äôs twice M1 Pro and six times M1.</p>
<p>This wider memory interface lets the M1 custom package support</p>
<p>up to 64 gigabytes of unified memory.</p>
<p>And its die has a staggering 57 billion transistors.</p>
<p>That‚Äôs 1.7 times M1 Pro, and 3.5 times M1.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs the largest chip we‚Äôve ever built, by far.</p>
<p>M1 Max has the same powerful 10-core CPU complex of M1 Pro</p>
<p>and doubles the GPU to a massive 32 cores,</p>
<p>giving M1 Max</p>
<p>up to four times faster GPU performance than M1.</p>
<p>And it has an even more capable media engine,</p>
<p>with up to two times faster video encoding</p>
<p>and two ProRes accelerators.</p>
<p>M1 Max delivers all of this,</p>
<p>with industry-leading performance per watt.</p>
<p>For Apple silicon, power efficiency defines system performance.</p>
<p>That‚Äôs why M1 is a breakthrough.</p>
<p>When you look at its multi-core CPU performance versus power curve,</p>
<p>it continues to crush the latest 4-core PC laptop chip.</p>
<p>M1 is phenomenal.</p>
<p>And when you add in M1 Pro and M1 Max,</p>
<p>they deliver dramatically more performance.</p>
<p>To put that in perspective,</p>
<p>here is the latest 8-core PC laptop chip.</p>
<p>M1 Pro and M1 Max have higher performance at every power level.</p>
<p>At their peak, they deliver 1.7 times the performance of the PC chip,</p>
<p>in the same power envelope.</p>
<p>And at the peak performance of the PC chip,</p>
<p>they deliver the same performance at 70% less power.</p>
<p>That‚Äôs a big deal.</p>
<p>Now here is the GPU performance versus power curve of M1.</p>
<p>And here is the integrated graphics in that 8-core PC laptop chip.</p>
<p>M1 easily outperforms it while using significantly less power.</p>
<p>So when we add in M1 Pro, it&rsquo;s in a whole different class.</p>
<p>At its peak, it‚Äôs more than seven times faster.</p>
<p>Now, many PC laptops add a discrete GPU for better graphics performance.</p>
<p>So here is a PC laptop with a powerful discrete GPU.</p>
<p>M1 Pro delivers more performance while using 70% less power.</p>
<p>But that‚Äôs not all.</p>
<p>There are compact pro laptops that have higher performing,</p>
<p>yet very power-hungry discrete GPUs.</p>
<p>They deliver strong performance, but they consume a ton of power.</p>
<p>And on a notebook, when you consume that much power,</p>
<p>it means more heat, noisy fans, and less battery life.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s look at M1 Max.</p>
<p>It delivers comparable performance while using 40% less power.</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s compare M1 Max</p>
<p>to the chip running in the fastest PC laptop we could find.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a high-end system that is much bigger and heavier than a compact pro laptop.</p>
<p>It delivers even faster graphics performance,</p>
<p>but it also consumes a massive amount of power.</p>
<p>Here, M1 Max delivers similar performance</p>
<p>while using 100 watts less power.</p>
<p>This is unheard of.</p>
<p>And this remarkable efficiency means M1 Max performance is outstanding,</p>
<p>plugged in or using the battery.</p>
<p>If you look at the compact pro laptop on battery,</p>
<p>its graphics performance drops significantly.</p>
<p>M1 Max is up to 2 1/2 faster.</p>
<p>And if you look at the high-end laptop when it&rsquo;s on battery,</p>
<p>the drop off in graphics performance is even more extreme.</p>
<p>M1 Max is over three times faster.</p>
<p>This is one of the huge advantages that Apple silicon brings</p>
<p>to our pro users.</p>
<p>So that‚Äôs M1 Max,</p>
<p>scaling up the M1 architecture even further,</p>
<p>it‚Äôs by far the most capable chip we‚Äôve ever built.</p>
<p>Simply put, it‚Äôs the world‚Äôs most powerful chip for a pro notebook.</p>
<p>Next, here‚Äôs Craig to tell you how macOS takes full advantage</p>
<p>of M1 Pro and M1 Max.</p>
<p>[upbeat hip-hop music]</p>
<p>‚ô™ ‚ô™</p>
<p>Craig: These new chips are phenomenal.</p>
<p>By designing macOS for our own silicon,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re able to take the experience of using a Mac to a whole new level.</p>
<p>Everything is incredibly fast and responsive.</p>
<p>Apps launch instantly.</p>
<p>And my personal favorite, instant wake from sleep.</p>
<p>For these new pro chips, we‚Äôve made improvements</p>
<p>across the system to provide the best performance on the most demanding apps.</p>
<p>For example, using pro app workload data</p>
<p>to help optimize how macOS assigns multi-threaded tasks to the CPU cores.</p>
<p>Advanced power management features intelligently allocate tasks</p>
<p>between the performance and efficiency cores,</p>
<p>giving you both incredible performance and incredible battery life.</p>
<p>So you can compile more code</p>
<p>or edit more video on a single charge.</p>
<p>And macOS is designed to take advantage of the unified memory architecture</p>
<p>in these new chips.</p>
<p>So pro apps can manipulate huge images or video streams</p>
<p>and move them between the CPU and GPU</p>
<p>with zero copies for breathtaking performance.</p>
<p>Technologies like Metal let apps automatically scale</p>
<p>with our new chips for even better performance.</p>
<p>Thanks to Core ML optimizations,</p>
<p>machine learning models perform,</p>
<p>on average, over three times faster</p>
<p>compared with the fastest Core i9 MacBook Pro,</p>
<p>with some ML models performing over 20 times faster.</p>
<p>And when it comes to security,</p>
<p>M1, M1 Pro, and M1 Max are a major leap forward,</p>
<p>with industry-leading protections.</p>
<p>Like hardware verified secure boot,</p>
<p>runtime anti-exploitation technologies,</p>
<p>and fast in-line encryption for all of your files.</p>
<p>Next, let‚Äôs talk about apps.</p>
<p>With Apple silicon, users get way more of them,</p>
<p>and they perform better than ever.</p>
<p>Every app made by Apple is optimized for</p>
<p>and runs natively on Apple silicon.</p>
<p>We also have Rosetta 2, so Intel-based apps&ndash;</p>
<p>even pro apps with plug-ins&ndash; simply run without missing a beat.</p>
<p>And even running under Rosetta, applications invoking macOS technologies</p>
<p>like Metal get a big speed boost from our optimizations for Apple silicon.</p>
<p>And you can run iPhone and iPad apps on Mac,</p>
<p>opening a huge new universe of possibilities.</p>
<p>To unlock the full power and performance of these chips,</p>
<p>apps can be recompiled to run natively as Universal.</p>
<p>All of our Pro apps are Universal,</p>
<p>and today we&rsquo;re launching some exciting updates</p>
<p>with new features and even faster performance on M1 Pro and M1 Max.</p>
<p>With Logic Pro, for the first time,</p>
<p>musicians will be able to create massive spatial audio mixes on a notebook.</p>
<p>In Final Cut Pro, video analysis for the new object tracking feature</p>
<p>is up to five times faster.</p>
<p>And in Compressor, ProRes video transcode</p>
<p>is a remarkable ten times faster.</p>
<p>Of course, this isn‚Äôt just about Apple.</p>
<p>Developers are moving fast and there are now over 10,000</p>
<p>Universal apps and plug-ins available,</p>
<p>including Lightroom Classic,</p>
<p>Cinema 4D, Capture One, Sketch, and many more.</p>
<p>We gave some developers an early look,</p>
<p>and they were blown away by what they could do with M1 Pro and M1 Max.</p>
<p>Let‚Äôs hear from a few of them.</p>
<p>Hey, I&rsquo;m Rohit.</p>
<p>Hi, I&rsquo;m Nick.</p>
<p>My name is Meagan Keane.</p>
<p>Jules Urbach.</p>
<p>My name is Philip Losch.</p>
<p>Pro Apple silicon has three and a half times the transistor count,</p>
<p>four times the unified memory,</p>
<p>and six times the memory bandwidth of the M1.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It&rsquo;s&hellip; - Like a racing car.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tshh! - Zoom!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Four times the performance in DaVinci Resolve.</p>
<p>Five times faster GPU performance.</p>
<p>Eight times faster ProRes-to-ProRes rendering performance.</p>
<p>In a typical shot, for example, a basketball shot,</p>
<p>you will do primary color correction,</p>
<p>secondary color correction,</p>
<p>magic masks, power windows with tracking.</p>
<p>And you can apply all this in real time.</p>
<p>This was not possible before.</p>
<p>Imagine taking this performance anywhere.</p>
<p>These new pro chips allow you to create and shape the world in a playful way.</p>
<p>Cinema 4D is nearly three times faster.</p>
<p>Redshift is over four times faster.</p>
<p>This completely unlocks new possibilities.</p>
<p>The first thing that comes to my mind when I think of a scale test</p>
<p>is just spinning cubes&hellip;</p>
<p>thousands and thousands and thousands of them.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re making a game,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re constantly iterating.</p>
<p>You iterate again and again and again and again.</p>
<p>[growls]</p>
<p>The increased performance of these new pro chips</p>
<p>mean you can make more complex scenes,</p>
<p>bigger games, better games all on your laptop.</p>
<p>Launching Premiere Pro feels super snappy.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re seeing improvements every step of the way,</p>
<p>like Scene Edit Detection,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s up to five times faster now.</p>
<p>Your creativity can be limitless.</p>
<p>You can be underwater,</p>
<p>you can transition into outer space,</p>
<p>into the redwoods.</p>
<p>Creatives can just get back to being creative.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s never been a GPU with 64 gigs, ever in a notebook.</p>
<p>And it changes our entire workflow.</p>
<p>For example, that 100-gigabyte Starship Enterprise,</p>
<p>loading it all into memory, slicing through it,</p>
<p>seeing every detail of that,</p>
<p>it just hasn&rsquo;t been possible in any other piece of hardware.</p>
<p>If I had to summarize what M1 Pro and M1 Max mean to me,</p>
<p>I‚Äôd say they‚Äôre life-changing.</p>
<p>Whoa.</p>
<p>Craig: When we put all of this together,</p>
<p>great apps, macOS, and these new chips,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re able to deliver breakthrough performance,</p>
<p>unbelievable battery life,</p>
<p>and phenomenal pro capabilities.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just awesome to see our vision for Apple silicon truly come to life.</p>
<p>Now, back to John.</p>
<p>[upbeat music]</p>
<p>John: M1 Pro and M1 Max represent a huge leap forward</p>
<p>in silicon for pro systems.</p>
<p>And our teams have been hard at work designing a brand new MacBook Pro</p>
<p>that can take full advantage of that incredible performance and capability.</p>
<p>And the result is something truly special.</p>
<p>[ominous music]</p>
<p>‚ô™ ‚ô™</p>
<p>‚ô™ ‚ô™</p>
<p>‚ô™ ‚ô™</p>
<p>‚ô™ ‚ô™</p>
<p>This is the all new, completely re-designed MacBook Pro.</p>
<p>And it comes in two sizes;</p>
<p>a 16-inch model and, for the first time,</p>
<p>a compact yet immensely powerful 14-inch model,</p>
<p>which shares the same remarkable features and capabilities.</p>
<p>The new MacBook Pro is a combination of groundbreaking performance</p>
<p>with amazing battery life, extraordinary display quality,</p>
<p>and advanced connectivity.</p>
<p>This is a pro notebook that simply has no equal.</p>
<p>It was designed with an intense focus on performance and utility.</p>
<p>The all new aluminum enclosure</p>
<p>optimizes internal space for more performance and features.</p>
<p>And it is precisely machined around an advanced thermal system.</p>
<p>It can move 50% more air, even at lower fan speeds.</p>
<p>This thermal design enables MacBook Pro to deliver</p>
<p>phenomenal sustained performance, while operating quietly.</p>
<p>And because of the efficiency of Apple silicon,</p>
<p>the fans never even have to turn on for most of the tasks you do every day.</p>
<p>And it‚Äôs all in a design that‚Äôs just 16.8mm thin and 4.7 pounds</p>
<p>on the 16-inch model,</p>
<p>and just 15.5mm thin and 3.5 pounds on the 14-inch model.</p>
<p>Now, this all new design is just the beginning of the MacBook Pro story.</p>
<p>To tell you more, here‚Äôs Shruti.</p>
<p>[upbeat music]</p>
<p>‚ô™ ‚ô™</p>
<p>Shruti: The new MacBook Pro has been reimagined in every way.</p>
<p>Let‚Äôs start with the keyboard.</p>
<p>Users value the full-height function row on the standalone Magic Keyboard.</p>
<p>And we‚Äôve brought it to the MacBook Pro.</p>
<p>The physical keys replace the Touch Bar,</p>
<p>bringing back the familiar, tactile feel of mechanical keys that pro users love.</p>
<p>The keyboard is set in a double-anodized black well</p>
<p>that elegantly highlights the backlit glyphs on the keys.</p>
<p>And it‚Äôs complemented by our expansive, industry-leading Force Touch trackpad</p>
<p>that‚Äôs perfect for pro applications.</p>
<p>Now let‚Äôs talk about connectivity.</p>
<p>Having a wide range of ports can make life a lot easier for pros.</p>
<p>So I‚Äôm excited to share that we‚Äôre adding ports to the new MacBook Pro.</p>
<p>On one side, there‚Äôs an HDMI port</p>
<p>for conveniently connecting to displays and TVs,</p>
<p>a Thunderbolt 4 port, which connects to high-speed peripherals,</p>
<p>and an SD card slot, enabling fast access to media.</p>
<p>On the other side, the headphone jack now has</p>
<p>advanced support for high-impedance headphones</p>
<p>and there are two more Thunderbolt 4 ports,</p>
<p>for a total of three in the system.</p>
<p>And yes, MagSafe is coming back to the MacBook Pro.</p>
<p>MagSafe 3 has a new design that supports more power into the system.</p>
<p>And you can still charge via the Thunderbolt ports.</p>
<p>Display support is better than ever as well.</p>
<p>With M1 Pro, you can connect up to 2 Pro Display XDRs.</p>
<p>And with M1 Max, you can connect up to three Pro Display XDRs,</p>
<p>and a 4K TV, all at the same time.</p>
<p>That‚Äôs over 75 million pixels of screen real estate.</p>
<p>And you still have ports available</p>
<p>to connect to high-fidelity headphones and camera media.</p>
<p>All without a single adapter.</p>
<p>This is the most advanced connectivity ever on a Mac notebook.</p>
<p>The new MacBook Pro also has a breathtaking display.</p>
<p>To tell you more, here‚Äôs Kate.</p>
<p>[bass-heavy music]</p>
<p>‚ô™ ‚ô™</p>
<p>Kate: On the new MacBook Pro, we‚Äôre taking the stunning Retina display</p>
<p>to an entirely new level.</p>
<p>We started by bringing the sides of the enclosure</p>
<p>closer to the active area of the display,</p>
<p>resulting in a 24% thinner border.</p>
<p>We also expanded the display up and around the camera,</p>
<p>making the top border 60% thinner,</p>
<p>giving you even more screen real estate.</p>
<p>And macOS takes full advantage of this extra space</p>
<p>by raising the menu bar up and out of the way,</p>
<p>automatically wrapping it around the camera</p>
<p>to give you more room for your content.</p>
<p>And it looks great in dark mode, which our pro users love.</p>
<p>Altogether, it‚Äôs a fantastic user experience.</p>
<p>With this new design, the displays are now larger.</p>
<p>The 16-inch model has a 16.2-inch display</p>
<p>in nearly the same size enclosure.</p>
<p>And along with a higher pixel density, it has 1.8 million more pixels than before</p>
<p>for a total of 7.7 million.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the most ever in a Mac notebook.</p>
<p>The 14-inch model has an expansive 14.2-inch active area</p>
<p>and a total of 5.9 million pixels.</p>
<p>That‚Äôs even more pixels than the previous generation 16-inch MacBook Pro.</p>
<p>Next, we‚Äôre super excited to bring ProMotion technology to the Mac.</p>
<p>With refresh rates up to 120Hz,</p>
<p>ProMotion automatically adapts to the motion of your content.</p>
<p>So when your content is static, the refresh rate dynamically steps down</p>
<p>to preserve battery life.</p>
<p>And it steps up to make tasks like scrolling through web pages super fluid.</p>
<p>And video editors can still choose a standard refresh rate</p>
<p>when they need to lock one in.</p>
<p>The display now supports 1 billion colors for ultra smooth gradients.</p>
<p>And for the first time, it‚Äôs a Liquid Retina XDR display.</p>
<p>So users can create, edit, and review HDR content</p>
<p>with exceptional precision.</p>
<p>It was inspired by the capability of the Pro Display XDR</p>
<p>and it features the mini-LED technology used in iPad Pro,</p>
<p>which we‚Äôve built into the impossibly thin display enclosure of the new MacBook Pro.</p>
<p>We did this by integrating the custom-designed mini-LED backlight,</p>
<p>optical films and diffusers, and a cutting edge LCD panel</p>
<p>into the display housing.</p>
<p>And the display is uncompromising in its performance.</p>
<p>The state-of-the-art backlight features thousands of mini-LEDs</p>
<p>arranged in individually-controlled local dimming zones.</p>
<p>This enables up to an astonishing 1000 nits</p>
<p>of sustained full-screen brightness,</p>
<p>1600 nits of peak brightness,</p>
<p>and a staggering 1 million to 1 contrast ratio.</p>
<p>This is extreme dynamic range, bringing HDR content to life</p>
<p>with unbelievable detail in shadows, brilliant specular highlights,</p>
<p>even more vibrant colors,</p>
<p>and deeper blacks than ever before.</p>
<p>This new display is going to be amazing,</p>
<p>whether you‚Äôre adding final touches to an image</p>
<p>or just kicking back and watching a show in HDR.</p>
<p>This is hands down the world‚Äôs best notebook display.</p>
<p>To tell you about our new camera and audio system,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s Trevor.</p>
<p>Trevor: Our users are relying on the Mac more than ever to stay connected.</p>
<p>So we‚Äôve doubled the resolution of the camera to 1080p</p>
<p>and used a lens with a wider aperture that lets in more light.</p>
<p>Together with a larger image sensor that has more efficient pixels,</p>
<p>the camera delivers two times better low-light performance.</p>
<p>The camera system also uses the ISP and Neural Engine</p>
<p>for computational video, which enhances video quality.</p>
<p>So you get sharper images and more natural-looking skin tones.</p>
<p>With all these advancements, this is by far the best camera system</p>
<p>ever in a Mac notebook.</p>
<p>Now, let‚Äôs talk about the audio experience.</p>
<p>First, we made our industry-leading, studio-quality mics even better</p>
<p>with an up to 60% lower noise floor,</p>
<p>which means you get crystal clear recordings</p>
<p>that capture the subtlest sounds.</p>
<p>Next, the new 16-inch Pro has an even better 6-speaker sound system</p>
<p>that features two tweeters and four force-cancelling woofers.</p>
<p>The tweeters are nearly two times larger,</p>
<p>purifying the sound on mids and highs,</p>
<p>for a clearer soundstage.</p>
<p>The woofer diaphragms are also larger and have an increased range of motion,</p>
<p>so they can now displace twice as much air.</p>
<p>This allows them to deliver 80% more bass.</p>
<p>It also means they go half an octave deeper,</p>
<p>revealing a range of notes you previously couldn‚Äôt hear.</p>
<p>And we‚Äôve brought this sensational 6-speaker sound system</p>
<p>to the 14-inch Pro as well.</p>
<p>The new sound system also supports spatial audio,</p>
<p>which creates a sophisticated, three-dimensional soundstage.</p>
<p>So when you‚Äôre listening to music or watching a movie with Dolby Atmos,</p>
<p>you get a theater-like experience.</p>
<p>With studio-quality mics that have an even higher signal-to-noise ratio</p>
<p>and a spectacular six-speaker sound system with spatial audio,</p>
<p>there‚Äôs never been an audio system this good in a notebook.</p>
<p>We can‚Äôt wait for you to hear it.</p>
<p>Back to you, Shruti.</p>
<p>‚ô™ ‚ô™</p>
<p>Shruti: Let‚Äôs talk performance.</p>
<p>The new MacBook Pro pushes the limits of what a notebook can do.</p>
<p>The 16-inch model with M1 Pro and M1 Max</p>
<p>has up to two times faster CPU performance</p>
<p>than the previous generation with the Core i9.</p>
<p>This is a tremendous performance boost for compute-heavy tasks</p>
<p>like compiling a project in Xcode.</p>
<p>And when it comes to graphics, M1 Pro is up to 2.5 times faster</p>
<p>than the prior 16-inch model with the fastest GPU.</p>
<p>And M1 Max is up to four times faster.</p>
<p>This boost is dramatic for graphics-intensive tasks</p>
<p>like rendering scenes in Cinema 4D.</p>
<p>And when it comes to machine learning,</p>
<p>you‚Äôll get up to five times faster performance.</p>
<p>So things like selecting subjects within images in Photoshop</p>
<p>are faster than ever.</p>
<p>Now let‚Äôs look at the 14-inch model,</p>
<p>which is also configurable with M1 Max,</p>
<p>our most powerful chip.</p>
<p>Compared to the 13-inch model with a Core i7,</p>
<p>the 14-inch Pro has up to 3.7 times faster CPU performance.</p>
<p>For graphics, M1 Pro delivers up to nine times faster performance.</p>
<p>And M1 Max is up to an astonishing 13 times faster.</p>
<p>And ML tasks are up to 11 times faster.</p>
<p>So whether you‚Äôre stitching a massive panorama in Lightroom Classic</p>
<p>or rendering a complex scene with Redshift,</p>
<p>the 14-inch MacBook Pro absolutely crushes it.</p>
<p>And it goes even further.</p>
<p>The unified memory architecture enables workflows</p>
<p>that were previously unimaginable on a notebook.</p>
<p>Even the latest pro PC laptops top out at 16 gigs of video memory.</p>
<p>MacBook Pro has up to 64 gigabytes of unified memory,</p>
<p>so apps have dramatically more memory for the most demanding graphics tasks.</p>
<p>No other notebook even comes close.</p>
<p>So this means that on MacBook Pro,</p>
<p>3D artists can now easily work with extreme geometry and textures</p>
<p>in scenes that the latest pro PC laptops can&rsquo;t even run.</p>
<p>And with the enhanced media engine on M1 Max,</p>
<p>you can edit up to 30 streams of 4K ProRes video in Final Cut Pro</p>
<p>or up to 7 streams of 8K ProRes.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s more streams than on a 28-core Mac Pro with Afterburner.</p>
<p>And video editors can now color grade in HDR</p>
<p>on 8K ProRes 4 by 4 video on battery</p>
<p>when they‚Äôre miles away from the edit bay.</p>
<p>Finally, storage is getting even faster.</p>
<p>The super fast SSDs deliver</p>
<p>up to a jaw-dropping 7.4 gigabytes per second of read speeds,</p>
<p>more than two times faster than the prior gen SSDs.</p>
<p>These are, by far, the most powerful Mac notebooks ever.</p>
<p>The magic of M1 Pro and M1 Max</p>
<p>is that even though they‚Äôre extremely powerful,</p>
<p>they‚Äôre also remarkably power-efficient.</p>
<p>So pro users benefit from super fast performance</p>
<p>whether they‚Äôre plugged in or not.</p>
<p>And they benefit from extraordinary battery life,</p>
<p>so they‚Äôll get so much more done on a single charge.</p>
<p>Photographers who go from capture to publish on the go</p>
<p>will get up to two times longer battery life</p>
<p>in Lightroom Classic when editing images.</p>
<p>And developers working in Xcode will be able to compile</p>
<p>four times as much code.</p>
<p>And battery life is unbelievable</p>
<p>for everyday tasks like watching your favorite movies.</p>
<p>The 14-inch model delivers up to 17 hours of video playback,</p>
<p>which is 7 additional hours.</p>
<p>And the 16-inch model gets up to 21 hours of video playback,</p>
<p>which is 10 additional hours,</p>
<p>and the longest battery life ever on a Mac notebook.</p>
<p>And the new MacBook Pro now supports fast charge,</p>
<p>for the very first time on Mac,</p>
<p>so it can charge up to 50% in just 30 minutes.</p>
<p>And when it comes to the environment,</p>
<p>the new MacBook Pro raises the bar yet again.</p>
<p>The enclosure is made with 100% recycled aluminum,</p>
<p>which brings us a step closer to our goal</p>
<p>of using only recyclable and renewable materials.</p>
<p>And it is free of numerous harmful substances,</p>
<p>manufactured using even more renewable energy,</p>
<p>and meets Apple‚Äôs high standards for energy efficiency.</p>
<p>The new MacBook Pro is simply extraordinary.</p>
<p>It has a combination of phenomenal performance,</p>
<p>incredible battery life, and groundbreaking features</p>
<p>that set it apart from every other notebook.</p>
<p>Now before I hand it back to John,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s take another look at this beast of a machine.</p>
<p>[dramatic music]</p>
<p>‚ô™ ‚ô™</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve created something wild.</p>
<p>‚ô™ ‚ô™</p>
<p>With a fire in its belly.</p>
<p>This thing draws everything in.</p>
<p>Moving silently</p>
<p>night and day.</p>
<p>Into the deepest blacks</p>
<p>and brightest lights.</p>
<p>Its eye, razor sharp.</p>
<p>Its sound, deafening.</p>
<p>Pretty.</p>
<p>Dangerous.</p>
<p>‚ô™ ‚ô™</p>
<p>So why would anyone give this beast more power?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d have to be reckless.</p>
<p>‚ô™ ‚ô™</p>
<p>‚ô™ ‚ô™</p>
<p>[cheering]</p>
<p>What have we done?</p>
<p>And more importantly,</p>
<p>what will you do?</p>
<p>John: So that&rsquo;s the new MacBook Pro.</p>
<p>We couldn‚Äôt be more excited about what this groundbreaking system can do.</p>
<p>It allows pros to unleash their creativity in ways that were previously unimaginable.</p>
<p>And it‚Äôs for anyone who simply wants the world‚Äôs best notebook.</p>
<p>When you compare the 14-inch model</p>
<p>to the previous high-end 13-inch MacBook Pro,</p>
<p>you get a giant leap in performance,</p>
<p>up to 7 more hours of battery life,</p>
<p>a larger display with XDR, an advanced camera,</p>
<p>high-fidelity audio, and more ports all for $1,999.</p>
<p>And when you compare the new 16-inch Pro to the previous model,</p>
<p>you also get a massive boost in performance and capabilities</p>
<p>for $2,499.</p>
<p>Both models are available in silver and space gray.</p>
<p>You can order it today.</p>
<p>And it‚Äôll be available next week.</p>
<p>Today, we‚Äôve completely redefined high-performance Apple silicon</p>
<p>with M1 Pro and M1 Max.</p>
<p>They are by far the most powerful and capable chips we‚Äôve ever created,</p>
<p>and there‚Äôs never been anything like them.</p>
<p>Together with M1 they form an incredible family of chips</p>
<p>that leads the industry in performance and power efficiency.</p>
<p>The new MacBook Pro joins the 13-inch Pro with M1</p>
<p>to create the strongest lineup of pro notebooks we‚Äôve ever offered.</p>
<p>And with this introduction, we‚Äôve taken another huge step forward</p>
<p>in the Mac‚Äôs transition to Apple silicon.</p>
<p>Now back to Tim.</p>
<p>[upbeat music]</p>
<p>‚ô™ ‚ô™</p>
<p>‚ô™ ‚ô™</p>
<p>Tim: What a huge day for the Mac and our pro users.</p>
<p>These are the most powerful Mac notebooks we‚Äôve ever built</p>
<p>and the best example yet of the extraordinary performance and capabilities</p>
<p>we can deliver when we combine our most advanced Apple silicon</p>
<p>with the power of macOS.</p>
<p>Today, we focused on two areas very dear to us,</p>
<p>music and the Mac,</p>
<p>and the creative spirit fueled by each of them.</p>
<p>At Apple, creativity is so incredibly important to who we are and what we do.</p>
<p>Designing products that empower our users, as well as enable them</p>
<p>to be inspired by the creativity of others.</p>
<p>It helps drive our teams to continue pushing things forward,</p>
<p>to create products and experiences that enrich people‚Äôs lives.</p>
<p>I‚Äôd like to take a moment to thank everyone here at Apple</p>
<p>for their unbelievable effort this year.</p>
<p>And to everyone watching, thank you for joining us today.</p>
<p>Please take care, stay safe, and have a great day.</p>
<p>[upbeat music]</p>
