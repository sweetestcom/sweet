    <p>Our daughter&rsquo;s head is dropped because our doctor,</p>
<p>she felt the head and she was like, yeah, it&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>Hey Chamath, whose head has gotten bigger?</p>
<p>Yours or your daughter&rsquo;s?</p>
<p>What do you mean?</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t quit your day job, Sax.</p>
<p>Yeah, Sax.</p>
<p>That didn&rsquo;t quite land.</p>
<p>That didn&rsquo;t land.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s trying out material, total flow.</p>
<p>We are not in rhythm.</p>
<p>You know why?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s mercury retrograde.</p>
<p>Our 50th episode is gonna suck because of this.</p>
<p>Here we go.</p>
<p>Three, two.</p>
<p>‚ô™ I&rsquo;m going all in to let your winners ride ‚ô™</p>
<p>Rain Man David Saxon.</p>
<p>‚ô™ I&rsquo;m going all in and I said we open sources to the fans ‚ô™</p>
<p>‚ô™ And they&rsquo;ve just gone crazy with it, love you guys. ‚ô™</p>
<p>‚ô™ I&rsquo;m the queen of Quinoa, I&rsquo;m going all in. ‚ô™</p>
<p>All right, the Facebook whistleblower hearings occurred</p>
<p>and Facebook gave our-</p>
<p>No, but wait, where&rsquo;s your, hey, everybody.</p>
<p>Hey, everybody.</p>
<p>Hey, everybody.</p>
<p>Hey, everybody.</p>
<p>Welcome to another episode of the All In Podcast.</p>
<p>Episode 50.</p>
<p>We made it to 50.</p>
<p>Cinquanta.</p>
<p>Cinquanta.</p>
<p>Nobody expected us to make it.</p>
<p>Here we are.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve made it.</p>
<p>And everybody is thrilled to be here with you.</p>
<p>And thank you for the support over the first 50 episodes.</p>
<p>One episode closer to getting canceled.</p>
<p>One episode closer.</p>
<p>Man, how great would it be to be canceled</p>
<p>and never have to work again?</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;d be wonderful.</p>
<p>Okay, so Frances Haugen revealed herself</p>
<p>on Sunday night on 60 Minutes</p>
<p>and then appeared before the Senate on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Wait, don&rsquo;t we get our own personal intros,</p>
<p>or no, we&rsquo;re done with that?</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;re unbelievable.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t the audience know us?</p>
<p>Mercury retrograde, Mercury retrograde.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s Mercury retrograde, I&rsquo;m all fucked up.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t the audience know us by now after 50 episodes?</p>
<p>Do we really have to put them?</p>
<p>Everybody loves the intro.</p>
<p>Three, two, all right, with us again this week</p>
<p>is the Rain Man himself, David Sacks,</p>
<p>and the Queen of Quinoa, David Friedberg.</p>
<p>I love the intro.</p>
<p>Of course, the dictator, Chamath Palihapitiya,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m your boy, J. Cal.</p>
<p>Sacks, I gotta say, I think your AUM</p>
<p>is positively correlated with the bags under your eyes.</p>
<p>If you mean it&rsquo;s getting bigger, you&rsquo;re correct.</p>
<p>I mean, they&rsquo;re heavy.</p>
<p>Good Lord.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re heavy, dragging you down.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where you&rsquo;re hiding all that Solana</p>
<p>in your fucking, under your eyes.</p>
<p>You better clear that Solana position.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your lockup, 24 months?</p>
<p>Fuck, no, he&rsquo;s trying to sell it to me on text message.</p>
<p>Yeah, of course he is.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re negotiating discounts.</p>
<p>I just had the fact of the fact.</p>
<p>Hey, you&rsquo;re fucking the whole thing up.</p>
<p>Bro, you don&rsquo;t think just-</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m hodling, I&rsquo;m hodling.</p>
<p>You think I buy hundreds of millions of dollars</p>
<p>of anything without a discount?</p>
<p>Everything is a discount.</p>
<p>Everything&rsquo;s discounted.</p>
<p>You want to clear that position in an LLC?</p>
<p>Are you saying I got a billion dollars of Solana?</p>
<p>No, bro, I&rsquo;m saying I have one,</p>
<p>but you know, I brought it at a discount.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re holding, correct?</p>
<p>Ish.</p>
<p>Yeah, me too.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, if something appreciates,</p>
<p>at what point is the appreciation in an asset</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve invested in early,</p>
<p>something you need to, you know,</p>
<p>at least clear a position of and lock in a win?</p>
<p>I mean, what&rsquo;s enough, 100X, 500X?</p>
<p>You got to, at some point, bank a win, right?</p>
<p>Well, I think you have to put things in a bucket of like,</p>
<p>is it an investment or is it something</p>
<p>that represents an idea that you love so much?</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s the latter, you should never sell.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s the former, yeah, you got to manage risk.</p>
<p>Or rather, you know, is it a trade</p>
<p>or is it something you want to own?</p>
<p>By the way, let me just clean this up</p>
<p>because Solana was not a direct investment for us.</p>
<p>What we did is we invested in a crypto venture firm</p>
<p>called MultiCoin Capital.</p>
<p>This is back in 2017.</p>
<p>We realized like crypto was becoming</p>
<p>like a full-time job for us.</p>
<p>It was a total rabbit hole.</p>
<p>And we were like, we don&rsquo;t have time</p>
<p>to figure out this like 24-7 trading stuff.</p>
<p>But we met Kyle and Tushar who were these two young guys.</p>
<p>We met them through Vinny Lingham, actually.</p>
<p>And they were creating MultiCoin Capital.</p>
<p>And we actually invested, we gave them a million bucks</p>
<p>at a 20 cap to help set up their firm.</p>
<p>And then we invested in their,</p>
<p>they had both a venture fund and a hedge fund.</p>
<p>And they were like the first money into Solana.</p>
<p>So that fund, I mean, it&rsquo;s like a 100X fund.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like bonkers.</p>
<p>Crazy.</p>
<p>And so as a result of that,</p>
<p>we are indirect beneficiaries</p>
<p>of this huge increase in Solana.</p>
<p>It will end up being about a billion dollars of,</p>
<p>I think, Solana for us in terms of returns.</p>
<p>But the MultiCoin guys</p>
<p>determined the trading decisions on that.</p>
<p>Yeah, and so people who don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>Solana is a programmable Ethereum competitor, I guess.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s at $50 billion or so market cap.</p>
<p>It was trading at a dollar not long ago,</p>
<p>and now it&rsquo;s at 164.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an Ethereum competitor, basically,</p>
<p>for a smart contract platform.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a lot of people,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say smart money in Silicon Valley,</p>
<p>who are betting on a flippening</p>
<p>where Solana could ultimately overtake Ethereum</p>
<p>as the preferred platform.</p>
<p>But even if it doesn&rsquo;t overtake Ethereum,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the number eight cryptocurrency right now.</p>
<p>It could go, there&rsquo;s a lot of people betting</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll go to number three or what have you.</p>
<p>Additionally, it is a fraction of a penny</p>
<p>for a transaction,</p>
<p>and it can do many more transactions than Ethereum.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s technically should be much cheaper.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re buying NFTs right now,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re probably spending tens of dollars</p>
<p>in fees on Ethereum.</p>
<p>Whereas if you did those same NFTs,</p>
<p>which some people are starting to do on Solana,</p>
<p>they would cost a fraction of a penny.</p>
<p>Correct, David or Chamath?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think the platform is known</p>
<p>for being a faster, cheaper blockchain.</p>
<p>Really, really congratulations.</p>
<p>And if Vinny Lingam&rsquo;s Instagram is any indication,</p>
<p>he did pretty well because his Instagram</p>
<p>suddenly turned into a world tour on private jets.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, which island should I buy?</p>
<p>Well, Vinny was sort of like a,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s full-time in multi-coin,</p>
<p>but he was sort of a venture partner to Kyle and Tushar.</p>
<p>And he helped set them up.</p>
<p>This is back in 2017.</p>
<p>He helped bring us in as the first investors.</p>
<p>And I mean, for us, it was sort of a founder bet</p>
<p>combined with a team, like sort of a space bet.</p>
<p>Like we knew the cryptocurrencies</p>
<p>were starting to be traded 24-7.</p>
<p>We knew it required more of like a hedge fund skillset</p>
<p>than what we had.</p>
<p>And so we made a bet on those guys</p>
<p>and man, has that ever paid off.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of the nice strategies, right, Sax,</p>
<p>is if you are LPing in new fund managers,</p>
<p>which I&rsquo;ve done a couple of times now,</p>
<p>you get to learn from them</p>
<p>and basically dive into a data set of a new market, right?</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s like one of the nice things</p>
<p>about being an LP in a fund is you can place a small bet,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s 50K or 500K or 5 million, whatever it is,</p>
<p>you get like this meta-education of an entire sector,</p>
<p>correct?</p>
<p>Yeah, but I think we didn&rsquo;t do it to learn from them,</p>
<p>although we have, it&rsquo;s more that we realized</p>
<p>that crypto was, like I said, becoming such a rabbit hole.</p>
<p>Like we realized we would either need</p>
<p>to do crypto full-time as a fund</p>
<p>or we would need to like partner</p>
<p>with people who actually did.</p>
<p>And you see that with like a lot of VC firms now,</p>
<p>is they&rsquo;re creating like specialized crypto funds</p>
<p>or at least they have specialized crypto partners.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so much to know about the crypto world.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a hard thing to invest in</p>
<p>unless you&rsquo;re like totally focused on it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve struggled with that.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;ve tried to go deep on a couple topics</p>
<p>and like I realized, holy shit,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been in this for like four to six hours</p>
<p>just trying to learn this stuff and I&rsquo;m not like there.</p>
<p>And then I feel uncertain about making any decisions.</p>
<p>I totally get it.</p>
<p>I mean, you gotta have folks like working on this.</p>
<p>And the pace is changing so rapidly.</p>
<p>You really need to kind of be up to date on what&rsquo;s next.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really challenging.</p>
<p>When you look at crypto, people use the word crypto</p>
<p>as if it&rsquo;s like, that&rsquo;s all there is.</p>
<p>Totally.</p>
<p>Crypto is like distributed computing,</p>
<p>e-cash, cryptography, financial modeling</p>
<p>or building new economic systems, Chamath.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s business model innovation.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s technology innovation.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s economic innovation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s-</p>
<p>Distributed computing innovation.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Infrastructure, hardware.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s quite a lot of layers of activity.</p>
<p>Chamath, are you spending time in crypto yourself</p>
<p>or do you have people doing it for you</p>
<p>or how are you kind of-</p>
<p>Look, we have a lot of it.</p>
<p>A lot of a lot of everything.</p>
<p>So yeah, we have things-</p>
<p>But do you go deep yourself, Chamath?</p>
<p>Like how do you spend enough time</p>
<p>to really get up to speed on all the goings on?</p>
<p>I cherry pick and I snipe</p>
<p>and opportunities where I get intellectually curious</p>
<p>and jump in.</p>
<p>But a lot of the credit goes to my team.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a couple of folks</p>
<p>that spend a lot of their time in it.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve had a couple people do extremely well for us.</p>
<p>Similar to David&rsquo;s story, back in the day,</p>
<p>I invested in Barry Silbert and DCG-</p>
<p>Second market, Barry Silbert.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And DCG is now, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m guessing a $20 billion company, maybe more.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>So how does it mechanically work with your team?</p>
<p>They are investigating opportunities</p>
<p>and then they come to you and bring you,</p>
<p>hey, we&rsquo;ll do a meeting</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m gonna share four with you.</p>
<p>And then you say,</p>
<p>hey, let me get on the phone with that guy.</p>
<p>Do you basically go deep when something shows up, Chamath?</p>
<p>No, so basically what happens is</p>
<p>they have carte blanche to do whatever they want.</p>
<p>And what they&rsquo;re typically doing</p>
<p>is they&rsquo;re working with entrepreneurs to seed projects</p>
<p>and to get projects off the ground.</p>
<p>And then at some point</p>
<p>when those projects become large enough,</p>
<p>then they&rsquo;ll issue tokens</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll get a certain allocation of those tokens.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;ve done that for, call it, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>some number of projects that we think are valuable.</p>
<p>Then along the way,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll have certain views on Bitcoin,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll have certain views on Ethereum,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll have certain views on Solana</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll make capital allocation decisions.</p>
<p>They tend to have the ability to do whatever they want.</p>
<p>And then what I tend to do is just think about</p>
<p>when it gets above,</p>
<p>to me, I need to see the chance to make at least</p>
<p>in the rough justice around 500 to a billion dollars</p>
<p>and then I&rsquo;ll get involved.</p>
<p>But otherwise they just kind of run the whole thing.</p>
<p>Let me ask you guys a question here.</p>
<p>When you look at the market caps of these projects,</p>
<p>it seems like things are changing.</p>
<p>Cardona or Cardona is number three now</p>
<p>and Tether still remains number five,</p>
<p>XRP still number six, but Solana-</p>
<p>I would encourage people to not look at it like that.</p>
<p>I think looking at it as a rank list betrays what it is.</p>
<p>So, you know, I&rsquo;ll give you a simple example.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s like compare the fate of two projects</p>
<p>or actually right now there&rsquo;s a distributed form</p>
<p>of Discord that&rsquo;s being built.</p>
<p>Discord the chat app, very popular amongst gamers.</p>
<p>In a completely distributed way</p>
<p>with an integrated crypto wallet.</p>
<p>Because if you look at Discord,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really two cohorts of people.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s gaming and there&rsquo;s crypto, right?</p>
<p>So-</p>
<p>Those are the two big ones, yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an example of a really interesting product</p>
<p>that has some real potential.</p>
<p>Then if you look at something like Deeso,</p>
<p>Deeso is a decentralized social programming framework.</p>
<p>Then if you look at something like Helium,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s completely about building a large distributed,</p>
<p>you know, connection of on-ramps to the internet.</p>
<p>So internet connectivity.</p>
<p>So those are three completely different ideas</p>
<p>with three completely different paths to success.</p>
<p>If to invest in those tokens,</p>
<p>you have to believe in three totally different</p>
<p>sets of things.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So to look at it on a rank list and just buy something</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s cheap is-</p>
<p>Yeah, no, no.</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just going to be blunt, it&rsquo;s stupid.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>Well, no, no.</p>
<p>That wasn&rsquo;t really my question.</p>
<p>My question was, you know,</p>
<p>we have an extraordinary number of the public</p>
<p>who&rsquo;ve invested in Bitcoin and Ethereum</p>
<p>as number one and number two.</p>
<p>And those projects feel maybe stagnant</p>
<p>when compared to the dynamism of what I&rsquo;ll call,</p>
<p>you know, the projects launched</p>
<p>in the last three or four years.</p>
<p>Because they&rsquo;re the different, no, no.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re talking about confusing.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s what I mean.</p>
<p>Those are layer one protocols, right?</p>
<p>Meaning they are at the core substrate</p>
<p>of how all of crypto is going to work.</p>
<p>Then you have these other projects</p>
<p>that build on top of these things in different ways</p>
<p>or build around them.</p>
<p>So my point is, if you don&rsquo;t have,</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t want to take the time to understand</p>
<p>which layer twos you want to own</p>
<p>and which layer ones you want to own and why,</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re much better off.</p>
<p>I understand your point.</p>
<p>My point is-</p>
<p>Buying an ETF or something else</p>
<p>because there are ways to own these things.</p>
<p>So for example-</p>
<p>David, Solana does not need Ethereum to exist.</p>
<p>So my point is, do we see a day when this, you know,</p>
<p>the past decade has been about Bitcoin and Ethereum.</p>
<p>Do we see a day when maybe people stop buying those</p>
<p>and start buying these new ones?</p>
<p>Anything&rsquo;s possible,</p>
<p>but here&rsquo;s the evolution in our thinking.</p>
<p>I mean, the first step was realizing,</p>
<p>okay, we need to own Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because, you know, there&rsquo;s now enough evidence</p>
<p>where what, like a decade,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re more than a decade into this,</p>
<p>nobody has been able to essentially counterfeit a Bitcoin.</p>
<p>It is, you know, new money.</p>
<p>It is better money.</p>
<p>So if you, so I&rsquo;m not gonna convince people right now</p>
<p>of the argument for Bitcoin,</p>
<p>but if you believe in it,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s sort of the first step</p>
<p>is you realize you really need to have</p>
<p>one to 2% of your portfolio in Bitcoin</p>
<p>in the event that fiat money sort of becomes debased</p>
<p>and eventually you move to crypto.</p>
<p>Then you realize, well, wait a second,</p>
<p>Bitcoin is just one application of blockchains.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a bunch of applications of blockchains.</p>
<p>So maybe we need to own not just sort of, you know,</p>
<p>digital money,</p>
<p>but we also need to own the underlying blockchain platform</p>
<p>and that leads you to Ethereum.</p>
<p>Then you realize that there&rsquo;s a bunch of competitors</p>
<p>to Ethereum and it&rsquo;s still very early days.</p>
<p>And one of those guys might ultimately</p>
<p>displace Ethereum as a blockchain platform.</p>
<p>Then you realize that there&rsquo;s all these applications</p>
<p>on top of all these blockchains.</p>
<p>And so, you know,</p>
<p>the conclusion I come to after all of that</p>
<p>is I can&rsquo;t figure all this out.</p>
<p>And well, maybe I could,</p>
<p>if I was willing to go back to school</p>
<p>and like make this a full-time job,</p>
<p>which I just don&rsquo;t want to do.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m lazy and that&rsquo;s why I focus on SaaS.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s what I know as an investor.</p>
<p>Yeah, like I&rsquo;m not gonna reinvent myself.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like you playing Hold&rsquo;em versus PLO.</p>
<p>Right, right, right, exactly.</p>
<p>So, but this is why we partner with MultiCoin Capital.</p>
<p>So what I would just say is like</p>
<p>the idea that you as an individual investor</p>
<p>are gonna like, you know,</p>
<p>pick off the one cryptocurrency here or there to invest in.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s gonna be a lottery.</p>
<p>I would find a manager basically who is really good,</p>
<p>who has a track record, who understands this stuff.</p>
<p>Our approach is to hire very young,</p>
<p>extremely technical computer scientists and mathematicians</p>
<p>to basically do the work.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s working.</p>
<p>Yeah, and you know,</p>
<p>one of the things that I think these guys do</p>
<p>and the reason why it is very helpful</p>
<p>for them to be computer scientists</p>
<p>is these are all open-source projects.</p>
<p>So they go look at the repos.</p>
<p>Just go look at what-</p>
<p>You can actually see the changes being made.</p>
<p>And this is like,</p>
<p>do you realize there&rsquo;s only 12 people</p>
<p>who are actively working on Solana in the-</p>
<p>But you need to look at all the code check-ins.</p>
<p>Seven of them work for Solana.</p>
<p>You need to look at all the code check-ins.</p>
<p>You need to look at the velocity of the code check-ins</p>
<p>so you can see like how many projects</p>
<p>are being created on these platforms.</p>
<p>The white papers are also really exceptional.</p>
<p>Like if you read these white papers,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re really incredibly thoughtful and well-written</p>
<p>and you can really understand what their goals are</p>
<p>and you can make some informed decisions there.</p>
<p>But again, if you&rsquo;re not gonna be in the business</p>
<p>of being in this ecosystem,</p>
<p>because I think David&rsquo;s right,</p>
<p>everything is moving so fast.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s successful today could be just a dog tomorrow</p>
<p>and vice versa.</p>
<p>That I think speculating in this market will,</p>
<p>not only will it be super volatile,</p>
<p>but more than likely you&rsquo;re gonna lose all your money.</p>
<p>So I would encourage people to not speculate in crypto.</p>
<p>I would encourage you to figure out an elegant way</p>
<p>of having an abstracted bet</p>
<p>if to the extent you care about it.</p>
<p>And by the way, in the UK, for example,</p>
<p>there are ways where you can own</p>
<p>publicly traded mutual funds</p>
<p>that give you exposure to this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just simpler. Like ETFs.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Yeah, but there are mutual funds of crypto.</p>
<p>Do the work, find these mutual funds,</p>
<p>just own those things and let somebody else do the hard work</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s too hard.</p>
<p>Some of the other investments we made</p>
<p>back in 2017, 2018 timeframe,</p>
<p>one was a company called Bitwise,</p>
<p>which was creating an ETF for crypto.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a monthly rebalanced portfolio</p>
<p>of I think the top 10 cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>And you could buy it.</p>
<p>They finally got approved by the SEC</p>
<p>and you can buy it like with a ticker symbol</p>
<p>from your E-Trade account.</p>
<p>You can buy it in Robinhood or E-Trade.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>So that was pretty incredible</p>
<p>to see the progress they&rsquo;ve made.</p>
<p>And then the other big bet we made</p>
<p>was just institutional custody.</p>
<p>Back in 2017, we invested in BitGo.</p>
<p>Actually, Bill Lee helped found that company many years ago.</p>
<p>And then that became last year,</p>
<p>Galaxy announced a deal to acquire them</p>
<p>for I think 1.2 billion largest crypto acquisition to date.</p>
<p>The thesis there was just that</p>
<p>crypto would go more institutional.</p>
<p>And I think we&rsquo;re starting to see that now</p>
<p>where endowments and so on are realizing</p>
<p>they need to have some portion,</p>
<p>maybe 1% or 2% of their portfolio in crypto.</p>
<p>And so-</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s unrealistic.</p>
<p>Look, we have almost $3 trillion of market cap in crypto.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s unrealistic for folks to expect people</p>
<p>to be able to be living in Discord channels</p>
<p>and doing all of this work.</p>
<p>I think what that means is that the SEC</p>
<p>is going to be asked increasingly more often</p>
<p>to approve simpler on-ramps for this stuff.</p>
<p>And now in the last week, by the way,</p>
<p>we had a pretty important two things happen.</p>
<p>Both Jerome Powell and Gary Gensler basically said,</p>
<p>crypto is here to stay</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re not going to ban this stuff.</p>
<p>And so hopefully what it means</p>
<p>is that you get some ETFs passed in the United States.</p>
<p>Grayscale is one, there could be more.</p>
<p>And I think that stuff makes it much easier</p>
<p>for folks to own this stuff.</p>
<p>Well, clear regulation would be a great thing</p>
<p>for the industry, for people to buy into it</p>
<p>and removing some of the, let&rsquo;s call them,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to say bad actors,</p>
<p>but people who are maybe questionable like Tether.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you saw the Bloomberg story yesterday,</p>
<p>but a Bloomberg reporter basically found out that Tether,</p>
<p>he got the list of what Tether owns with their stable coin.</p>
<p>And it looks like they&rsquo;re giving a lot of loans</p>
<p>to other crypto projects and own a lot of Chinese paper</p>
<p>in that they are basically making the float</p>
<p>on $69 billion sweeping it,</p>
<p>which then incentivizes them to take risky bets</p>
<p>because they get paid on them.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s anything but a stable coin</p>
<p>if you think about it from that regard.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, I don&rsquo;t know the details on Tether.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t speak to that, but I&rsquo;ll say that any stable coin,</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s not 100% backed by dollars,</p>
<p>if that&rsquo;s a currency that&rsquo;s going in and out</p>
<p>or other hard currency, that&rsquo;s not a stable coin.</p>
<p>A stable coin is supposed to be a service.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not supposed to be a speculator&rsquo;s currency.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s basically just supposed to be a mechanism</p>
<p>at the on-ramps and off-ramps of the crypto ecosystem,</p>
<p>you can convert your dollars into a temporary,</p>
<p>like a stable coin that will hold its value.</p>
<p>A poker chip.</p>
<p>A poker chip that you can use</p>
<p>to then buy Bitcoin or Ethereum or whatever.</p>
<p>Yeah, USDC, Jeremy Allaire&rsquo;s-</p>
<p>Circle.</p>
<p>Competitor from Circle just said</p>
<p>that he would switch to 100%</p>
<p>to what you&rsquo;re saying, cash, cash equivalents.</p>
<p>Guys, this has always been a money market fund.</p>
<p>It should be treated like a money market fund</p>
<p>and it should be regulated and managed like a money market.</p>
<p>Which was Tether&rsquo;s original vision</p>
<p>and then they flipped the script</p>
<p>because I think they got greedy</p>
<p>and now they own, I think, 3% or 4% cash.</p>
<p>And because they want regulated.</p>
<p>By the way, it speaks to the role of regulation.</p>
<p>Like, you know, a lot of people have trust and faith</p>
<p>because they make some claim,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s no regulator actually checking on their claims.</p>
<p>The only people that want regulation</p>
<p>are two ends of the spectrum.</p>
<p>So young and so disruptive</p>
<p>where they want Rails to operate legally</p>
<p>and so big and so over the top</p>
<p>that they want to basically entrench themselves</p>
<p>for the rest of their lives.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>Everybody in the middle doesn&rsquo;t really want regulation.</p>
<p>Well, what&rsquo;s a way to create-</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re a crypto company</p>
<p>or if you&rsquo;re a big tech, you both want regulation.</p>
<p>Well, but there are some narrow cases.</p>
<p>Like again, you know, if a stable coin is going to say</p>
<p>that we are just a money market fund,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re 100% dollar reserve,</p>
<p>it is really nice to have a regulator,</p>
<p>somebody we trust to go in there</p>
<p>and put the stamp of approval on it</p>
<p>so we can trust it.</p>
<p>Or an SRO.</p>
<p>That is a valid role, I think, for a regulator.</p>
<p>In traditional financial markets,</p>
<p>you have these self-regulating bodies.</p>
<p>I think FINRA is a self-regulating body, right?</p>
<p>And so some of these self-regulating bodies</p>
<p>should be formed in the crypto community.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if they&rsquo;re doing this.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so naive in this space,</p>
<p>but certainly would make sense to have an SRO form</p>
<p>that does self-policing effectively within the community</p>
<p>rather than try and bring in a government regulator.</p>
<p>Well, here&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>If you police yourself,</p>
<p>you can really define the execution</p>
<p>and the ramifications of that policing.</p>
<p>If you have 30, call it, competitors and cooperators</p>
<p>in the market space doing this together,</p>
<p>it can be a highly effective model</p>
<p>for creating a system of trust and reliability</p>
<p>and not having to, you know, bring in,</p>
<p>you know, call it outside incompetence</p>
<p>to overseeing the rules and rights.</p>
<p>Yeah, another area we need standards</p>
<p>is around the token cap tables for these projects, right?</p>
<p>So how much of the token cap table goes to the founders?</p>
<p>What are the rules around them selling?</p>
<p>What are those investing periods?</p>
<p>And what are the disclosures around them selling?</p>
<p>In public markets, we have 10b5.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re an insider who runs these companies,</p>
<p>you have to disclose when you&rsquo;re selling.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no similar rule for crypto.</p>
<p>I think there probably should be, right?</p>
<p>Like if you own the token and you run this project</p>
<p>as publicly traded and the public can buy it,</p>
<p>you should really probably have to disclose your sales.</p>
<p>And maybe, you know, it&rsquo;s very strange</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re running foundations</p>
<p>and I had a crypto person on from a music crypto project.</p>
<p>And he said they had like three or 400 million</p>
<p>in this project in Panama.</p>
<p>I was like, who&rsquo;s on the board of that?</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, I can&rsquo;t say, why can&rsquo;t you say?</p>
<p>And he said, security reasons.</p>
<p>I was like, well, anybody who&rsquo;s on a public board</p>
<p>has to be public.</p>
<p>And of course they have, you know,</p>
<p>people who are on the board of GE or IBM or Amazon,</p>
<p>they have security issues.</p>
<p>Like they deal with their security issues.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t mean they don&rsquo;t disclose who they are.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, yeah, I&rsquo;m not comfortable saying who they are.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, okay, well they sold three or 400 million.</p>
<p>I was like, how do they give that money out?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, he&rsquo;s like, I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;m not on it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, what?</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s some organization in Panama that&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>it was really weird.</p>
<p>And I think you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>The one thing that I&rsquo;ll say positively</p>
<p>about these crypto founders is that they will never allow</p>
<p>a single venture investor to clog up their cap table,</p>
<p>number one.</p>
<p>They do a great job of creating these large broad syndicates</p>
<p>of participation when they seed their projects.</p>
<p>And then, you know, a lot of it goes into treasury</p>
<p>where then they issue coins as needed.</p>
<p>And I think that that strategy actually</p>
<p>is very pro-employee and pro-ecosystem.</p>
<p>So, you know, when we see these projects,</p>
<p>all these companies tend to raise, you know,</p>
<p>three, four, 5 million bucks.</p>
<p>It all tends to be at like 30 million pre</p>
<p>and it all tends to be distributed.</p>
<p>So like, you know, it&rsquo;s us Andreessen Sequoia</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like, you know, we put in 200 grand each</p>
<p>or 400 grand each.</p>
<p>You know, that&rsquo;s why you&rsquo;re forced to then go</p>
<p>into the market if you believe in a project</p>
<p>and then spend hundreds of millions of dollars</p>
<p>to buy into it after the fact.</p>
<p>And I think that that&rsquo;s very, very powerful.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a really important dynamic that if it comes back</p>
<p>to a traditional venture, it could be really disruptive.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Well, could you imagine a SaaS founder that basically</p>
<p>all of a sudden says, all right, you know what?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m raising a $6 million Series A, you know,</p>
<p>Kraft can take 500K, Sequoia, you can have 500K,</p>
<p>you know, blah, blah, blah folks.</p>
<p>And then you raise 6 million bucks that way</p>
<p>and you never allow anybody to have more than call it,</p>
<p>you know, a few percent of a company.</p>
<p>So the fact that it&rsquo;s like a mini IPO,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like a private IPO on Sand Hill Road.</p>
<p>Yeah, and then your board construction looks</p>
<p>entirely different.</p>
<p>And then as a result, you know, founder protections</p>
<p>probably go way up.</p>
<p>Employee protections probably go way up.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually-</p>
<p>And governance goes way down.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>I actually think what will happen is you&rsquo;re less likely</p>
<p>in a round like that to be okay with some dork,</p>
<p>Dingleberry joining your fucking board.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to actually point to some industry expert</p>
<p>and say, this person is joining my board.</p>
<p>She does XYZ job at such and such a startup.</p>
<p>And then the investors say, wow,</p>
<p>well, that&rsquo;s a pretty great advocate for the business.</p>
<p>Go ahead and do that.</p>
<p>Another thing I learned about this whole token space</p>
<p>was when I talked to Anatoly from Solana,</p>
<p>when they sold their three or 400 million tokens</p>
<p>to fund the company,</p>
<p>because they consider them utility tokens, not shares,</p>
<p>they paid taxes on it.</p>
<p>So the IRS is getting massive amounts of tax revenue.</p>
<p>Well, think about it.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re selling the token.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s supposed to be for utility.</p>
<p>Well, therefore it&rsquo;s a taxable event.</p>
<p>That actually was really smart.</p>
<p>That is showing, I think, some wisdom</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s a lot of founders</p>
<p>who want to have their cake and eat it too,</p>
<p>which is to say, they want to say</p>
<p>that these are utility tokens and they don&rsquo;t pay tax.</p>
<p>And then when they later get traded,</p>
<p>they want to say that they&rsquo;re not, you know,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not securities.</p>
<p>But so when does the tax get paid?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s really smart to pay the tax up front</p>
<p>to establish that this is a corporate sale.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re basically paying the corporate tax, right?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>That is what is, because this is the problem is</p>
<p>if you wait until they&rsquo;re traded publicly</p>
<p>and then say, no, no, no, no,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re utility tokens, not security tokens,</p>
<p>the government&rsquo;s going to ask you,</p>
<p>well, why didn&rsquo;t you pay corporate income tax</p>
<p>when you sold them, right?</p>
<p>So that is actually showing some perspicacity, I think.</p>
<p>Uh, could somebody look that word up for me?</p>
<p>Do you know that word?</p>
<p>Foresightedness, J Cal.</p>
<p>Okay, great.</p>
<p>Awesome.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so great that you have the two producers</p>
<p>on either side of you right now</p>
<p>feeding you vocabulary words.</p>
<p>Well done.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s, here&rsquo;s, you know, another question with this.</p>
<p>If the majority of people sacks,</p>
<p>just put your legal hat on for a second.</p>
<p>If the majority of people who bought a token in a project,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll call it the, you know, Acme crypto project,</p>
<p>they buy Acme coins.</p>
<p>If they&rsquo;re buying them and they have absolutely no interest</p>
<p>in using them for the utility,</p>
<p>and they say, I bought these as a speculative device</p>
<p>and the founder says they&rsquo;re utility tokens,</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s say 70% of the people who bought them</p>
<p>said, I didn&rsquo;t buy them for that reason.</p>
<p>They just came out, right?</p>
<p>And said, I bought this to speculate on the price.</p>
<p>What should the government do?</p>
<p>Should they deem them a security</p>
<p>or should they deem them a utility token?</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a complicated question,</p>
<p>but I think that there should be an opportunity</p>
<p>for these cryptocurrencies to establish themselves</p>
<p>as utility tokens, because they are,</p>
<p>they do serve a purpose.</p>
<p>They are designed to be part of a system, right?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not just objects of speculation.</p>
<p>And by the way, even if they were,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t treat baseball cards as, you know,</p>
<p>as sort of a security.</p>
<p>So it wouldn&rsquo;t necessarily make them a security</p>
<p>just because they&rsquo;re speculated on.</p>
<p>They actually do serve a function</p>
<p>in a designed computer system.</p>
<p>So I think what&rsquo;s important here</p>
<p>is that there&rsquo;s a safe harbor</p>
<p>where these crypto companies know what the rules are.</p>
<p>And if they can basically meet the criteria,</p>
<p>such as by paying corporate income tax</p>
<p>when they sell the tokens and other things like that,</p>
<p>that they won&rsquo;t later be deemed to be engaged</p>
<p>in an unlawful sale of securities.</p>
<p>I think the important thing is just that</p>
<p>entrepreneurs, founders know what the rules are</p>
<p>so they can abide by them and not be surprised.</p>
<p>And they don&rsquo;t right now.</p>
<p>Well, so they don&rsquo;t get surprised later.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t get whammied, but with basically, you know,</p>
<p>because they are building something legitimate here.</p>
<p>You know?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>But it would seem to the sniff test</p>
<p>if the people buying the tokens have no idea,</p>
<p>have never written a line of code, have no use for them.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see why that&rsquo;s relevant.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see why that&rsquo;s relevant.</p>
<p>Well, because they&rsquo;re profiting off of them</p>
<p>as if they&rsquo;re shares and unlike baseball cards,</p>
<p>which you can&rsquo;t sell a thousand baseball cards for</p>
<p>and increasingly, you know, in a very instantaneous way,</p>
<p>you would have to put them in an auction.</p>
<p>You kind of can.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;d be a lot of friction.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;d be a lot of friction.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t trade it. You could sell physical coins.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s certainly like, yeah.</p>
<p>Freeberg, what do you think?</p>
<p>If the majority of people buying a token</p>
<p>are doing it to speculate,</p>
<p>can the founder say it&rsquo;s a utility token?</p>
<p>And then those people who are trading it</p>
<p>like either baseball cards, minted coins,</p>
<p>whatever analogy shares you want to use</p>
<p>are in it for the increase in the value,</p>
<p>should it be a security</p>
<p>and should they have to play by the rules we play at</p>
<p>in the traditional venture startup game?</p>
<p>I mean, the question is, what&rsquo;s the utility?</p>
<p>So, I mean, if you can demonstrate some utility,</p>
<p>then maybe that&rsquo;s the,</p>
<p>and this will probably be litigated at some point, right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;ll be enough capital sloshing around here</p>
<p>that someone will say, you know what, we believe strong.</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;re seeing this happen with Ripple already,</p>
<p>but someone will litigate this</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll get some clear definition</p>
<p>on what statutes are going to be referenced</p>
<p>and what those statutes might say</p>
<p>with respect to how this ties to the definition of utility.</p>
<p>And then that&rsquo;ll become hopefully a standard</p>
<p>that people can kind of look to to guide them in the future.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s definitely the Wild West right now.</p>
<p>And everyone&rsquo;s going to try it.</p>
<p>The reason I bring it up</p>
<p>is because Gensler was sort of floating this argument.</p>
<p>Chamath, what do you think?</p>
<p>I think that you can&rsquo;t wipe $3 trillion of value</p>
<p>out of the world.</p>
<p>And so-</p>
<p>So pragmatically hard to do, got it.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s here to stay.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s too institutionalized now.</p>
<p>So, you know, there&rsquo;s just way too many</p>
<p>organized pools of capital that are now speculating</p>
<p>inside of this entire ecosystem.</p>
<p>You know, I saw a tweet today,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a firm I think like called Jump Trading</p>
<p>or something.</p>
<p>High-speed frequency trading organization.</p>
<p>And they tweeted out some pictures where, you know,</p>
<p>they hired a bunch of folks to start at Jump</p>
<p>and they did a coding bootcamp on Solana.</p>
<p>That was their onboarding as an example.</p>
<p>So when you have people in high finance, you know,</p>
<p>really vested in this thing</p>
<p>and you have $3 trillion of value</p>
<p>that&rsquo;ll go to 6 trillion and then go to 10 trillion,</p>
<p>this can&rsquo;t go away.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why I think Powell and Gensler</p>
<p>had to say some version of that on the record,</p>
<p>which is, you know, we&rsquo;re not gonna ban this stuff</p>
<p>because they know it&rsquo;s not possible.</p>
<p>So I think David&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>You have to create some rules,</p>
<p>make folks and let folks pay their taxes.</p>
<p>You know, I remember, for example,</p>
<p>like I did this Bitcoin transaction in 2014 or something.</p>
<p>I bought some land, I used BitPay,</p>
<p>I transferred some Bitcoin, bought the land, blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p>I was like, you know, whatever.</p>
<p>But then-</p>
<p>Whatever?</p>
<p>I mean, I left, I mean,</p>
<p>I owned a lot at the time, so it wasn&rsquo;t that big of a deal.</p>
<p>But my point is, finding a way for me to pay my taxes</p>
<p>was a huge deal, I remember.</p>
<p>And, you know, we filed the tax return</p>
<p>and we tried to make sure that we paid our taxes.</p>
<p>These are very complicated.</p>
<p>Even if you wanna be conformant to the government,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s impossible right now.</p>
<p>So they just need to create some rules</p>
<p>where folks can say, here&rsquo;s what I own,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s worth, tell me how much I owe you,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re all willing to pay,</p>
<p>or not, maybe we&rsquo;re all not, I am.</p>
<p>Because I just think it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>make sure that we can trade around it,</p>
<p>hedge it, structure it,</p>
<p>do the things that we would normally do</p>
<p>with any other risk assets.</p>
<p>Right now, that&rsquo;s very hard.</p>
<p>And when you own lots of this stuff,</p>
<p>it sits in your balance sheet</p>
<p>and you just take these enormous swings</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re just like, God,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t do anything around this stuff.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not a viable financial market.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t-</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>To be specific about what Gensler said,</p>
<p>I just looked it up here.</p>
<p>You know, he compared utility tokens</p>
<p>with, you know, laundromat tokens</p>
<p>or tickets to the opera.</p>
<p>And he said, entrepreneurs are choosing</p>
<p>to perceive their tokens as utility</p>
<p>to sidestep regulation.</p>
<p>And that, here&rsquo;s the quote,</p>
<p>they are highly speculative investment tokens</p>
<p>for people who are trying to save</p>
<p>or speculate for their future.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why I think it&rsquo;s appropriate</p>
<p>to bring them inside the investor protection perimeter.</p>
<p>I agree with him.</p>
<p>I also agree with you, Chamath,</p>
<p>that this is a can of worms</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t know how you put the genie back in the bottle.</p>
<p>No, but he&rsquo;s partially right.</p>
<p>I mean, he is partially right on some tokens,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s not completely accurate on some other tokens.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s on a case-by-case basis and it depends.</p>
<p>Listen, I think anybody who is buying these tokens right now</p>
<p>knows that they&rsquo;re engaged in financial speculation.</p>
<p>This idea that people in middle America</p>
<p>are gonna blow their retirement savings on crypto,</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t really buy it.</p>
<p>No, but if they know, if they&rsquo;re doing speculation,</p>
<p>then it should be a security.</p>
<p>No, no, no, David, I think you&rsquo;re totally wrong.</p>
<p>I totally buy it.</p>
<p>Look at the quarterly returns,</p>
<p>the filings of earnings from companies like Robinhood</p>
<p>and how much, and Square,</p>
<p>and how much money they make from crypto</p>
<p>and look at their audience.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s totally not true.</p>
<p>But don&rsquo;t you think that audience skews really young</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re getting their COVID stimulus check</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re yellowing it into meme stocks or crypto?</p>
<p>What does that have to do with-</p>
<p>Well, because you&rsquo;re making it sound</p>
<p>like they&rsquo;re gonna blow their retirement savings.</p>
<p>Okay, well, if you&rsquo;re talking about a 25-year-old</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s got $5,000 of retirement savings, maybe,</p>
<p>but they still got 40 years of work ahead of them.</p>
<p>Hold on a second.</p>
<p>Wait, no, they don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>This is gonna be the least hardworking generation</p>
<p>of our lifetime.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>No, no, no, not because they&rsquo;re not hardworking.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s $70 trillion that boomers have</p>
<p>that they are about to pass down to these folks</p>
<p>on average between two and three trillion a year</p>
<p>for the next 30 years.</p>
<p>Also, they know how to do gig work.</p>
<p>Like, they&rsquo;re so smart, this generation.</p>
<p>They know how to do projects for five grand</p>
<p>and float themselves.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna take one entire turn of the world&rsquo;s GDP</p>
<p>and give it to 100 million people in America</p>
<p>over the next 20 to 30 years.</p>
<p>That is what is actually going to happen.</p>
<p>So-</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Look, I think-</p>
<p>Of course they&rsquo;re gonna keep YOLOing this stuff.</p>
<p>Yeah, look, I think we&rsquo;re getting off</p>
<p>on like a little bit of a tangent here.</p>
<p>A good one.</p>
<p>My point is not that there shouldn&rsquo;t be</p>
<p>investor protections, but rather that I think we also</p>
<p>need to balance another important objective,</p>
<p>which is to create a hospitable environment for innovation.</p>
<p>And the fact of the matter is that you&rsquo;ve got</p>
<p>a lot of brilliant young entrepreneurs,</p>
<p>computer scientists building this financial infrastructure</p>
<p>of the future with crypto.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just speculation.</p>
<p>There is a lot of code being written.</p>
<p>It has functionality.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a purpose to it.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t necessarily want to interfere with that</p>
<p>to the point where we break it.</p>
<p>Well, every startup has to do their securities though,</p>
<p>David.</p>
<p>All the other startups that are not in crypto</p>
<p>are playing by the rules.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s crypto, people get a pass.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s unfair.</p>
<p>I agree with J-Kel.</p>
<p>People make this claim and I just think it&rsquo;s so specious.</p>
<p>Do you think that you would have made</p>
<p>a single professional decision in your life</p>
<p>based on tax rate?</p>
<p>Have you ever made a single like,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to start this company.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to make this product.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;m going to change this job.</p>
<p>I just think that most people-</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m not talking about paying taxes.</p>
<p>I think it was smart for, for example,</p>
<p>Solana to pay corporate taxes on their token sale.</p>
<p>I think everyone should pay their taxes.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not what we&rsquo;re talking about here.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not saying that Gensler</p>
<p>shouldn&rsquo;t prescribe regulations.</p>
<p>I think that part of the purpose of those regulations</p>
<p>should be to give entrepreneurs predictability</p>
<p>to be able to give them a safe harbor</p>
<p>so they can build what they want to build.</p>
<p>Let me make one final point.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just saying from my perspective,</p>
<p>I just think that if you have clear, sensible taxation,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s 90% of what this industry needs.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think it will change anybody&rsquo;s real motivation</p>
<p>to work inside this ecosystem.</p>
<p>I agree with that.</p>
<p>Just like entrepreneurship doesn&rsquo;t change</p>
<p>when capital rates, capital gains rates-</p>
<p>Look, I&rsquo;ve paid taxes at, you know,</p>
<p>on all my crypto sales,</p>
<p>like it was any other investments since the beginning.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not the issue.</p>
<p>The issue is when you&rsquo;re a company and you&rsquo;re raising money,</p>
<p>should you be allowed to not follow securities law</p>
<p>because you say it&rsquo;s a token?</p>
<p>Friedberg, when you look at this,</p>
<p>an NFT company came out this past week</p>
<p>that was selling shadow shares in startups.</p>
<p>And anyone in the world could buy a shadow share</p>
<p>in a private company like Stripe, et cetera,</p>
<p>in this fantasy football league.</p>
<p>They wound up shutting it down or changing it</p>
<p>because they didn&rsquo;t want to trade</p>
<p>on other people&rsquo;s intellectual property.</p>
<p>They were concerned about that.</p>
<p>But just looking at it, the public in America,</p>
<p>96% of them who are not accredited</p>
<p>cannot buy shares of Stripe in the secondary market,</p>
<p>but you can buy NFTs in it and speculate on the NFTs,</p>
<p>which are accelerating from, you know,</p>
<p>$1,000 to $500,000 in these different clubs.</p>
<p>How is it fair that crypto companies</p>
<p>get to not obey basic securities laws?</p>
<p>Friedberg?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s not a security, there&rsquo;s no underlying asset.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a collectible.</p>
<p>An NFT is clearly a collectible, J.Cow.</p>
<p>Okay, and when you produce 10,000 of them</p>
<p>and have a marketplace for people to sell them</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re appreciating,</p>
<p>I mean, I do agree it&rsquo;s something different.</p>
<p>Sounds like art to me.</p>
<p>Yeah, you could go draw a picture of Stripe</p>
<p>and put it on a piece of paper and go down to downtown</p>
<p>wherever and stand in front of the burrito shop</p>
<p>and try and sell it to people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s qualitatively different than a security,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re acting as securities</p>
<p>in relation to the fundraising of these projects.</p>
<p>So I think that&rsquo;s the challenge.</p>
<p>Not everything is a security.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s no secured interest.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have any secured interest.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s literally just like an image, a figure.</p>
<p>I was just offered a Giacometti sculpture,</p>
<p>but I turned it down.</p>
<p>How much, 60 million?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not gonna comment on the price.</p>
<p>I have to say no.</p>
<p>Was Stephen Cohen selling it?</p>
<p>Not commenting on the seller.</p>
<p>I bet Stephen Cohen was selling it.</p>
<p>That was the record deal.</p>
<p>Stephen Cohen bought that Giacometti sculpture</p>
<p>a few years ago.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the highest price ever paid at auction</p>
<p>for a piece of art in the US.</p>
<p>Can I just tell you my problem with it?</p>
<p>I took the price and I divided it</p>
<p>by the height in centimeters, and it just tilted me.</p>
<p>Is price per square inch a metric in art?</p>
<p>It is in my head.</p>
<p>In 2015, Stephen Cohen paid $141 million</p>
<p>for the Giacometti sculpture.</p>
<p>L&rsquo;homme aux deux, pretty incredible.</p>
<p>And I think you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about 12 inches tall or something.</p>
<p>I just wanna let you know that that sculpture</p>
<p>looks like it was done by a 12 year old.</p>
<p>Oh my God, stop.</p>
<p>Oh, J. Cal, J. Cal, you&rsquo;re getting it.</p>
<p>God, stop.</p>
<p>Yeah, J. Cal.</p>
<p>This is the billionaire equivalent</p>
<p>of crypto and NFTs, right?</p>
<p>Totally, totally.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what scam this guy&rsquo;s running,</p>
<p>but that looks like-</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how anyone can raise their hand</p>
<p>and say, I have an independent objective assessment</p>
<p>of the value of anything in the world.</p>
<p>And you can look at it from high to low,</p>
<p>and this is all effectively a subjective business.</p>
<p>This sculpture looks like it was a beautiful sculpture</p>
<p>that was in a giant fire</p>
<p>and that somebody pulled out of the ashes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a beautiful piece.</p>
<p>If you wanna read a little bit of art history,</p>
<p>yeah, you can understand a little bit</p>
<p>about Giacometti&rsquo;s work,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a 70 inch piece, not 12 inches, sorry.</p>
<p>And yeah, his work is all about kind of like,</p>
<p>how do you capture the essence of the form?</p>
<p>Anyway, this is a super ridiculous tangent.</p>
<p>It looks like somebody made something out of mud</p>
<p>and put it into a clay oven.</p>
<p>I have a very funny Stevie Cohen story.</p>
<p>So this was like 10 years ago at Art Basel in Miami.</p>
<p>And the day before the art fair opens,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s called the Furnissage.</p>
<p>And so, it&rsquo;s like a day where you can go</p>
<p>and see the stuff the day in advance</p>
<p>and you can kind of buy stuff or whatever.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s very funny.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of like when Walmart does like a Black Friday</p>
<p>thing, like everybody lines up</p>
<p>and then they open the doors and we all run in.</p>
<p>And I was standing side by side.</p>
<p>We were right at the front of the line.</p>
<p>And I noticed that he had these,</p>
<p>and this was my first time there.</p>
<p>He had New Balance running shoes on.</p>
<p>And I thought, what is he doing?</p>
<p>But then when the doors went open,</p>
<p>they just took off and started running.</p>
<p>And I was walking wearing normal loafers.</p>
<p>And then I realized I should have been wearing running shoes.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t own normal loafers.</p>
<p>You were wearing Italian loafers.</p>
<p>I miss that on everything.</p>
<p>I like the balloon dog guy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the running of the bulls.</p>
<p>I miss that.</p>
<p>It was, it was the running of the bulls.</p>
<p>I miss that on everything.</p>
<p>Running of the billionaires.</p>
<p>I got to the things after, and I was like,</p>
<p>oh, sorry, I sold it to Stevie Cohen.</p>
<p>I sold it to Stevie Cohen.</p>
<p>Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>I had blisters on my feet.</p>
<p>It was brutal.</p>
<p>Do you guys know we haven&rsquo;t even started our agenda?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Episode 50 of our great show.</p>
<p>Episode 50&rsquo;s a dream.</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s the moderator?</p>
<p>Fucking moderating this.</p>
<p>Three, two, all right,</p>
<p>put whistleblower earrings to Kurt, yada, yada.</p>
<p>Hey, everybody, everybody.</p>
<p>Welcome to the All In podcast.</p>
<p>Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>All right, listen.</p>
<p>Welcome to the All In podcast.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start our show.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure everybody by now has seen Frances Haugen</p>
<p>on 60 Minutes and testifying.</p>
<p>She seemed incredibly credible, well-spoken,</p>
<p>and had very common sense,</p>
<p>non-extreme views about what should be happen,</p>
<p>what should happen with the research</p>
<p>that Facebook has been funding.</p>
<p>That shows, like other media forms,</p>
<p>Instagram and Facebook have a really terrible effect</p>
<p>on young people, specifically young girls</p>
<p>and body dysmorphia, which seems to be the one thing</p>
<p>that is landing pretty well.</p>
<p>Her suggestions were not to break up Facebook.</p>
<p>Hers was to have a regulatory body</p>
<p>and to do soft interventions.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t know soft interventions.</p>
<p>Her suggestions were worse than breaking up Facebook.</p>
<p>Well, soft interventions, let&rsquo;s get to that,</p>
<p>include things like, hey,</p>
<p>in order to retweet the story on Twitter,</p>
<p>you probably should read it first.</p>
<p>She thinks she wants to reform,</p>
<p>or she&rsquo;s an advocate for reforming Section 230</p>
<p>in relation, I think, to the algorithms.</p>
<p>And the idea here would be that the algorithms</p>
<p>are making an actual editorial decision,</p>
<p>which is something that I remember</p>
<p>in the YouTube early days, they said,</p>
<p>we will not feature your videos that you&rsquo;re making,</p>
<p>but we will have the algorithm pick them</p>
<p>because that keeps our safe harbor.</p>
<p>Zuckerberg came back and wrote a spirited defense,</p>
<p>basically saying, why would we do this research</p>
<p>if we didn&rsquo;t care?</p>
<p>The people at this company care a ton.</p>
<p>Sachs and the entire Peter Thiel cobble</p>
<p>of, you know, acolytes and friends</p>
<p>are coming on strong as pro-Facebook.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll have him talk about that.</p>
<p>He thinks it&rsquo;s Facebook, it&rsquo;s laughable</p>
<p>that people are addicted to Facebook, yada, yada.</p>
<p>So who wants to go first, you, Chamath or Sachs?</p>
<p>Well, look, let me say a couple of things.</p>
<p>I think that, I think Zuck&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>the title of Zuck&rsquo;s internal company post</p>
<p>could have been titled, nah-ah,</p>
<p>which basically is his way of saying,</p>
<p>this is ridiculous and I don&rsquo;t believe it.</p>
<p>The thing that she asked for in substance</p>
<p>is a little different than what the DOJ</p>
<p>did with Microsoft in 2000,</p>
<p>but in form is actually quite similar,</p>
<p>which basically is like gumming up</p>
<p>how the internal product development</p>
<p>would work inside the company.</p>
<p>And, you know, the most damaging thing you already saw,</p>
<p>which is that they had a bunch of planned product releases</p>
<p>and then they put them on ice.</p>
<p>And I think this is really where unfortunately</p>
<p>the most damage gets done</p>
<p>because engineers won&rsquo;t really tolerate that</p>
<p>for some amount of time, right?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll put up with it initially,</p>
<p>but you know, you&rsquo;ve had, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>I think like a 20% reduction in stock price.</p>
<p>So you had, you know,</p>
<p>you lost $200 billion of market cap.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s probably going to be more turbulence in the company.</p>
<p>You can sustain and get through all of it</p>
<p>as long as the engineers hold the line.</p>
<p>But if you basically slow down</p>
<p>and put a pin in their ability to generate code</p>
<p>and to put out features, on the margins enough people</p>
<p>I think will get frustrated and leave.</p>
<p>And I think the way that she, you know,</p>
<p>what she is asking for was tantamount to that.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s the really destructive part</p>
<p>of what could go on here.</p>
<p>So they need to get this pin down quickly,</p>
<p>get in front of regulators, get some laws passed,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s section 230 or whatever,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the path to salvation for Facebook.</p>
<p>Saks, what do you think?</p>
<p>I see you&rsquo;re basically saying this is like ridiculous</p>
<p>and silly on Twitter.</p>
<p>Mike Salon is saying that,</p>
<p>obviously Peter Thiel is on the board of Facebook</p>
<p>and a major influence.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to have to give me time to unpack this,</p>
<p>Jake, how I&rsquo;m not getting hysterical</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s a lot to go over here.</p>
<p>No hysterical, I&rsquo;m literally throwing it to you</p>
<p>in a non-hysterical way.</p>
<p>You think that this is, there&rsquo;s nothing to this</p>
<p>and you think it&rsquo;s ridiculous.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s understand what this really was, okay?</p>
<p>You have this so-called whistleblower</p>
<p>who is working with the staff</p>
<p>of the Senate Judiciary Committee,</p>
<p>giving documents to the Wall Street Journal</p>
<p>and then appears on 60 Minutes in this great unveiling.</p>
<p>36 hours later, she&rsquo;s testifying on Capitol Hill.</p>
<p>That does not happen.</p>
<p>The Senate committees do not operate that fast.</p>
<p>This was coordinated.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s got a well-known Democratic operative</p>
<p>named Bill Burton working for her.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s got a team of lawyers.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s got a PR team.</p>
<p>This whole thing- Coordinated by who?</p>
<p>This is a coordinated hit, okay, by anti-Facebook forces,</p>
<p>starting with the Senate Judiciary Committee</p>
<p>who want to regulate- Who?</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s working with the staff, Jake.</p>
<p>Hold on, Jason, Jason, stop.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re already interrupting.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m asking you who.</p>
<p>You said she&rsquo;s working with somebody.</p>
<p>I want to know who it is.</p>
<p>Just let him make this argument and then just stop.</p>
<p>I want to hear what he has to say.</p>
<p>Okay, what is the purpose of this testimony?</p>
<p>First of all, we can go over the details of what she said.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there was anything new here.</p>
<p>This was all the same arguments we&rsquo;ve been hearing</p>
<p>from these same sort of forces</p>
<p>who want to regulate Facebook,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s the senators on the committee</p>
<p>who&rsquo;ve hauled up Zuckerberg no fewer than four times</p>
<p>to lecture him about the need for more censorship,</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s these forces of the media</p>
<p>who basically want Facebook.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all about having more censorship.</p>
<p>But in any event, there was nothing really new there.</p>
<p>What this really was was corroboration</p>
<p>and of the same talking points</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve been hearing for years.</p>
<p>And what it&rsquo;s all leading up to</p>
<p>is there&rsquo;s a very important part of her testimony,</p>
<p>which is, this is really the crux of it,</p>
<p>is that she proposed, and what Blumenthal wants,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee,</p>
<p>is a dedicated oversight body.</p>
<p>This is in this clip, okay?</p>
<p>With a power to oversee social media platforms.</p>
<p>So what we have here is the government</p>
<p>is now gonna have a new agency.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re saying, like the FTC.</p>
<p>Then she said, a regulatory home</p>
<p>where somebody like me could do a tour of duty</p>
<p>after working at a place like this.</p>
<p>And Haugen said, right now,</p>
<p>the only people in the world</p>
<p>who are trained to analyze these experiments</p>
<p>to understand what&rsquo;s happening inside of Facebook</p>
<p>are people who grew up inside of Facebook</p>
<p>or Pinterest or another social media company.</p>
<p>Basically, people with her experience.</p>
<p>I mean, I have to admire the chutzpah.</p>
<p>I mean, she&rsquo;s basically proposing</p>
<p>that she be made Zuckerberg&rsquo;s boss, okay?</p>
<p>That a new oversight board be created by the government,</p>
<p>which she would be appointed to,</p>
<p>which she presumably would run.</p>
<p>And this board is now gonna prescribe regulations and rules</p>
<p>for social networks</p>
<p>in terms of how their newsfeed is gonna run.</p>
<p>That is what was proposed on Capitol Hill.</p>
<p>That is what this operation is all about.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s about her getting a job</p>
<p>and being lording over Facebook is your claim?</p>
<p>No, I think the purpose of all of this</p>
<p>is to create new regulatory oversight of social networks.</p>
<p>I simply would note that she has proposed herself</p>
<p>as somebody who would be on this board,</p>
<p>which is pretty amazing.</p>
<p>But what this is really about is that new oversight power.</p>
<p>And is that a Republican or a Democrat?</p>
<p>Are you insinuating it&rsquo;s Democrats</p>
<p>who want to regulate this</p>
<p>or all politicians want to regulate this</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re scared of Facebook having too much power,</p>
<p>which I think we all agree Facebook has too much power</p>
<p>in the public square.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve had the leaders on the Senate Judiciary Committee</p>
<p>now for months calling up Zuckerberg and Dorsey</p>
<p>and other social media leaders</p>
<p>and basically lecturing them on the need to censor more,</p>
<p>to take down more material.</p>
<p>That is their objective.</p>
<p>This is not a conspiracy theory on my part.</p>
<p>This is expressly what they&rsquo;ve said, okay?</p>
<p>Now, until now-</p>
<p>Is it left or right or both?</p>
<p>Let me come to that.</p>
<p>I know Republicans are a little bit confused on this issue,</p>
<p>but let me get to that.</p>
<p>So what you&rsquo;ve heard until now</p>
<p>is attacks on the supply side of the platform.</p>
<p>So what they&rsquo;ve advocated is de-platforming people</p>
<p>with heterodox views, dissenting voices,</p>
<p>and they have been de-platformed in large numbers.</p>
<p>Obviously it started even before Trump,</p>
<p>but certainly the sitting president</p>
<p>of the United States was de-platformed.</p>
<p>YouTube just took down a million COVID videos</p>
<p>because they disagree with the official position on COVID.</p>
<p>So until now,</p>
<p>the censorship has been on the supply side of the platform.</p>
<p>What they&rsquo;re advocating for now</p>
<p>is censorship on the demand side of the platform,</p>
<p>which is we&rsquo;re going to rewrite these newsfeed rules, okay?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to rewrite them</p>
<p>because we can&rsquo;t give people what they want.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re making these algorithms sound</p>
<p>like they&rsquo;re these incredibly evil, sinister things.</p>
<p>All the algorithms do at the end of the day</p>
<p>is give the user more of what they&rsquo;re looking for, okay?</p>
<p>Well, hold on a second.</p>
<p>That is not good enough for these politicians.</p>
<p>They want to rewrite those rules.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not actually what they said.</p>
<p>They want to rewrite these rules</p>
<p>to determine what people see.</p>
<p>No, no, what they said about the algorithms</p>
<p>was that the algorithm had a multiplier on it</p>
<p>and that this multiplier of people resharing it,</p>
<p>re-engaging the content would lead people,</p>
<p>and this was statistically proven in Facebook&rsquo;s own research</p>
<p>that things that were either misinformation</p>
<p>or that were supercharged, you know, polarizing issues,</p>
<p>they would rise quicker,</p>
<p>which then gave people not what they wanted in their feed.</p>
<p>They gave people what would increase the length of a stay</p>
<p>on Facebook or on YouTube or on Twitter for that matter.</p>
<p>And they think the antidote for this</p>
<p>is to maybe not allow things in the algorithm to go viral</p>
<p>because what you&rsquo;re doing is saying</p>
<p>things that are either misinformation or polarizing</p>
<p>or will make things go to the top of the list</p>
<p>and maybe we don&rsquo;t want that as a society.</p>
<p>Let me intervene with a point of view on this</p>
<p>because I think you&rsquo;re headed down a path that,</p>
<p>to me, I don&rsquo;t think actually speaks</p>
<p>to what&rsquo;s really going on.</p>
<p>It sounds like there&rsquo;s some sinister architecture here</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s driving this outcome.</p>
<p>If you ask someone-</p>
<p>I never said that, yeah.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, it&rsquo;s implied because it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>oh, well, they&rsquo;re multiplying sinister stuff.</p>
<p>What makes it-</p>
<p>No, no, I&rsquo;m saying they just care about</p>
<p>length of stay on the site.</p>
<p>My belief is they just want it to grow.</p>
<p>They care about revenue.</p>
<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s my, exactly my point, Shamar.</p>
<p>They care about that.</p>
<p>They care about what consumers want to consume</p>
<p>and consumers demand what they want to consume.</p>
<p>Think about media in the old days, right?</p>
<p>We used to have books that an author</p>
<p>would put out every year.</p>
<p>And so the author would get feedback on the book</p>
<p>and so it would be one year on that feedback cycle.</p>
<p>Then magazines would come out.</p>
<p>Magazines would come out every month.</p>
<p>And so every month, the magazine would get feedback</p>
<p>on what sales were and they would make decisions,</p>
<p>editorial decisions, and they would iterate.</p>
<p>TV shows came out every week.</p>
<p>Newspapers came out every day.</p>
<p>Cable TV came out every hour</p>
<p>and they could adjust their content accordingly.</p>
<p>In the internet age,</p>
<p>the media is getting a much more kind of</p>
<p>instantaneous feedback cycle.</p>
<p>And the, call it publisher or editor or curator</p>
<p>of that media ultimately ends up putting</p>
<p>in front of the consumer more and more of what they want</p>
<p>as a function of what they&rsquo;re choosing to watch.</p>
<p>And what we&rsquo;re calling kind of these algorithms,</p>
<p>quote unquote, are really just the same thing</p>
<p>that editors and publishers and others have done</p>
<p>in the past, which is looking at what the consumer votes</p>
<p>by what they choose, making decisions to put more</p>
<p>of the things that they want in front of them.</p>
<p>The consumer consumes more of that.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s messed up.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re getting a very ugly look in the mirror</p>
<p>and what humanity and what citizens</p>
<p>and what individuals actually want to consume</p>
<p>and choose to consume and get turned on by.</p>
<p>And that is what&rsquo;s making this all so ugly.</p>
<p>And when we see that, we don&rsquo;t like to accept the fact</p>
<p>that maybe that is just what humans are attracted to</p>
<p>and what humans want to consume at scale.</p>
<p>And we end up wanting to blame someone.</p>
<p>And I could argue, and I think others could argue</p>
<p>that these algorithms that are effectively</p>
<p>just recursive optimization functions,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re recursively trying to figure out</p>
<p>what do people want to consume</p>
<p>and then giving them more of what they want.</p>
<p>You keep saying what?</p>
<p>Or simply solving for those very specific needs</p>
<p>and use cases.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think that those algorithms are necessary.</p>
<p>Go ahead, Chamath.</p>
<p>Why is it not want?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m interested in that, unpacking it.</p>
<p>No, everything Freeberg says is absolutely right,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not the word want.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not what they want.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s what they will react to the most.</p>
<p>And sometimes what they react to the most is-</p>
<p>Subconsciously want.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, but my point is that there&rsquo;s a,</p>
<p>I guess I don&rsquo;t use Facebook,</p>
<p>but they went from thumbs up and thumbs down</p>
<p>when I was there to like this nuance,</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s likes, there&rsquo;s tears,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s angry- Reshares.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s also analytics data on engagement, right?</p>
<p>Like on how long someone&rsquo;s watching a video or-</p>
<p>What I saw in there was that there was an amplification</p>
<p>of things that were more extreme emotional reactions.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Now, and the point is that</p>
<p>I think everything you said is absolutely right.</p>
<p>The algorithms are amplifying.</p>
<p>I think all I would say is I would restate</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re saying is these algorithms tend to amplify</p>
<p>the things that are the most extreme and elicit a reaction.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Those reactions aren&rsquo;t necessarily</p>
<p>the things that you want.</p>
<p>Those are the things that you will react to the most.</p>
<p>And by the way- That&rsquo;s what the algorithm</p>
<p>wants to serve you.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why you see that the top 10 things</p>
<p>that are reshared the most often</p>
<p>tends to be very extreme, right?</p>
<p>Fundamental emotional responses are typically associated</p>
<p>with things that I think we call hedonism.</p>
<p>And the things that you can ignore your emotional responses</p>
<p>and take another course of action,</p>
<p>we typically call altruism or what have you.</p>
<p>This is a kind of a common reason</p>
<p>why people would want to watch a comedy</p>
<p>or watch a horror film</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s some emotional response.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a universal response.</p>
<p>And people aren&rsquo;t rushing to the theater</p>
<p>to watch documentaries.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not rushing to the movie theater to be like,</p>
<p>oh, I want to be informed and educated</p>
<p>on something that&rsquo;s factual and interesting.</p>
<p>They want to go and have emotional experiences.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s how humans are biologically wired.</p>
<p>And the same is happening in these short forms of media,</p>
<p>these little tweets or these posts on Facebook.</p>
<p>David, you do understand that they won&rsquo;t show murders</p>
<p>and porn on Facebook.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re making an editorial decision to say,</p>
<p>hey, we&rsquo;re not going to-</p>
<p>They will every night on the local news.</p>
<p>If it bleeds, it leads.</p>
<p>How long has that been the motto in media?</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m listening- 100%.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m listening to Hagen on 60 Minutes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m hearing her describe a corporate profit-making machine</p>
<p>that tries to get more reach, more ratings</p>
<p>by fueling polarization and division.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m thinking, is she talking about cable news?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what she&rsquo;s talking about, isn&rsquo;t she?</p>
<p>Is she talking about the New York Times?</p>
<p>Is she talking about the traditional media?</p>
<p>Because every single thing she said</p>
<p>about how social media fuels polarization and division</p>
<p>applies to the media.</p>
<p>And yet those same voices in the traditional media</p>
<p>are the first ones howling about Facebook</p>
<p>and calling for its regulation.</p>
<p>It is completely hypocritical</p>
<p>because the real purpose here</p>
<p>is not to reduce divisiveness or polarization</p>
<p>in our society.</p>
<p>The regulations on Facebook will not do that.</p>
<p>It is to seize control and influence</p>
<p>over the machinery of social networking.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because the newsfeed now controls the flow</p>
<p>of information in our society.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t you think the damage has been done though?</p>
<p>Meaning in the sense that if you cripple</p>
<p>Facebook&rsquo;s product velocity</p>
<p>and you shrink the surface area</p>
<p>of the areas in which they can operate,</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t that more damaging than any regulation?</p>
<p>No, people will just stop using it</p>
<p>and then they will find another place</p>
<p>to get that same emotional behavior.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve already stopped using Facebook, okay?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t find it compelling at all</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m not really on Instagram either.</p>
<p>I do find Twitter rather compelling</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m probably more addicted to that than other things.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>Addicted, off the rails.</p>
<p>Probably not very good for me, okay?</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>I think all of us on this show right now,</p>
<p>none of us find Facebook particularly addictive</p>
<p>in our own behavior, okay?</p>
<p>I think we understand in our own behavior</p>
<p>that Facebook is sort of like a mildly diverting amusement</p>
<p>that occasionally yields information.</p>
<p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s useful, okay?</p>
<p>We understand that it&rsquo;s sort of like a newsfeed</p>
<p>with a lot of noise, okay?</p>
<p>In our own usage.</p>
<p>But somehow we&rsquo;ve bought into this larger narrative</p>
<p>that in everybody else&rsquo;s usage</p>
<p>that somehow this is a brainwashing machine</p>
<p>that is pumping people full of disinformation</p>
<p>and warping their thinking.</p>
<p>In other words, there&rsquo;s a sharp dichotomy</p>
<p>between how we perceive our own usage</p>
<p>and other people&rsquo;s usage.</p>
<p>And what I would submit is our own usage</p>
<p>is what we know and what we know to be true.</p>
<p>And what we believe about other people&rsquo;s usage</p>
<p>is simply a narrative that&rsquo;s been fed to us</p>
<p>over and over again by the traditional media</p>
<p>who hate Facebook because it&rsquo;s disremediating them.</p>
<p>That is what&rsquo;s really going on here.</p>
<p>You may be right.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m saying something different,</p>
<p>which is getting apart from all of that stuff,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s happening practically on the ground right now</p>
<p>that is a company who has to now slow way down.</p>
<p>And what I&rsquo;m saying is that&rsquo;s not dissimilar</p>
<p>to what Microsoft had to do,</p>
<p>which was there was this 10 year period at Microsoft</p>
<p>where they really couldn&rsquo;t innovate.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s really how the government</p>
<p>solved the Microsoft problem.</p>
<p>Yeah, they made them less aggressive, right?</p>
<p>They gummed up the internal machinery</p>
<p>so that Microsoft couldn&rsquo;t really be there</p>
<p>for the next few major.</p>
<p>So for example, we just spent 40 minutes</p>
<p>talking about crypto.</p>
<p>What do you think the chances are</p>
<p>that Facebook now can land</p>
<p>a really compelling crypto project?</p>
<p>Right, they got totally shut down with Libra, right?</p>
<p>I mean, they went after it</p>
<p>and the regulators stepped in.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s too bold for them to launch that after what happened.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s zero.</p>
<p>With their behavior in other arenas.</p>
<p>I think that like Microsoft back in the late 90s,</p>
<p>I think there are real and legitimate concerns</p>
<p>about the power of these big tech companies</p>
<p>about how big and powerful they&rsquo;ve become</p>
<p>about their ability to crush competitors.</p>
<p>I think those are all legitimate.</p>
<p>And in a weird way,</p>
<p>if this government scrutiny slows those companies down,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not an altogether bad thing.</p>
<p>But I am concerned about that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say separately,</p>
<p>just because these companies do deserve</p>
<p>to be scrutinized more.</p>
<p>I do think that we have to see</p>
<p>that the people who are engaged</p>
<p>in this really coordinated hit campaign against Facebook,</p>
<p>they have another agenda.</p>
<p>And that is to control the flow of information online.</p>
<p>It is to control online discourse.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s already been happening over the past year</p>
<p>with censorship on the supply side of the newsfeed.</p>
<p>And now they&rsquo;re trying to control the demand side.</p>
<p>I think we have to be extremely wary about this.</p>
<p>Well, David, you&rsquo;ve been on the other side of this</p>
<p>because on previous podcasts,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve talked about Facebook being too influential,</p>
<p>having too many users.</p>
<p>And now you&rsquo;re saying,</p>
<p>well, these tiny little news networks</p>
<p>that get a couple of low millions.</p>
<p>He has an issue, Jason,</p>
<p>with the way in which they&rsquo;re going after Facebook.</p>
<p>Okay, I get that.</p>
<p>He thinks it&rsquo;s a coordinated hit, fine.</p>
<p>But you also have had an issue</p>
<p>with Facebook having too much power</p>
<p>to take somebody off the platform</p>
<p>or to promote certain ideas.</p>
<p>So which is it?</p>
<p>It seems like you&rsquo;re a little bit-</p>
<p>Both can be true.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s perfectly consistent.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve expressed concerns about the way</p>
<p>in which Facebook is deplatforming people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s summarily silencing them and ghosting them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s engaged in censorship.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve expressed concern about that.</p>
<p>But we should understand</p>
<p>that the people on the Senate Judiciary Committee</p>
<p>who hauled up, who had this hearing,</p>
<p>who featured and spotlighted Hagen</p>
<p>and turned her into this great hero,</p>
<p>their agenda is even more censorship.</p>
<p>They are complaining about the fact</p>
<p>that Facebook is not censoring enough.</p>
<p>And that is what their real agenda is.</p>
<p>I do think it should have been disclosed</p>
<p>that Hagen does stand to gain financially</p>
<p>from whatever happens here.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know that that&rsquo;s been confirmed</p>
<p>that there is a whistleblower reward here.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ll have to wait and see about that.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t heard-</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no reward until there&rsquo;s a fine.</p>
<p>But Chamath is right that she qualifies,</p>
<p>if she&rsquo;s a whistleblower,</p>
<p>she qualifies for, what, a 30% portion</p>
<p>or some very large percentage of any fines?</p>
<p>What would the fine be here, though?</p>
<p>What would the fine be?</p>
<p>How would that be framed, Chamath?</p>
<p>This whole thing is just getting started.</p>
<p>There are gonna be government actions</p>
<p>and there will be settlements</p>
<p>from those government actions.</p>
<p>And Facebook, as you all know,</p>
<p>will pay any kind of fine to put this behind them.</p>
<p>Even billions of dollars.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re the one that said, Jason,</p>
<p>they spent $5 billion just so that</p>
<p>they wouldn&rsquo;t subpoena Zuck and Sherrill, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what you said last week?</p>
<p>We talked about that last week, yeah.</p>
<p>So, I mean, I think there&rsquo;s a fine coming.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s be honest.</p>
<p>I do not think Lena Khan or Gary Gensler</p>
<p>or any of these other folks</p>
<p>are going to be in the business</p>
<p>of making a quick decision,</p>
<p>nor the DOJ, nor any of these other folks.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re gonna wanna really take their time</p>
<p>to figure this out.</p>
<p>But what I&rsquo;m saying is,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not the ultimate result of it.</p>
<p>Because, again, I go back to like,</p>
<p>if you look at what happened in 2000 in Microsoft,</p>
<p>the substance of what Microsoft had to agree to</p>
<p>was ultimately not as bad</p>
<p>as the way in which it was implemented.</p>
<p>Which is that, my understanding was like,</p>
<p>Microsoft had to submit feature reviews</p>
<p>to lawyers at the DOJ,</p>
<p>who would then approve updates and upgrades</p>
<p>to their code base for things like Windows.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what caused them to miss an entire wave of compute.</p>
<p>And so this is the point,</p>
<p>which is, I think, practically speaking,</p>
<p>the beginning of what Microsoft went through,</p>
<p>Facebook is gonna have to navigate.</p>
<p>And so the faster they can try</p>
<p>to say, all right, folks, you&rsquo;re right, you caught us.</p>
<p>Let us tell us what to do.</p>
<p>Maybe actually the better path,</p>
<p>because it allows them to get past it.</p>
<p>Because the longer this period of like gray stretches out,</p>
<p>I think is actually the worst outcome.</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s go through what we each think</p>
<p>would be a possible solution here</p>
<p>to allowing free speech to occur on Facebook,</p>
<p>but maybe not having the things that,</p>
<p>fake news, misinformation,</p>
<p>maybe lowering down the rhetoric</p>
<p>and the charge nature of the algorithm.</p>
<p>Freeberg, do you have any common sense solution here</p>
<p>that might address both sides of the issue,</p>
<p>freedom of speech,</p>
<p>and maybe things being amplified</p>
<p>to 100 million people that are fake</p>
<p>and just simply not true?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve talked a lot about this notion</p>
<p>of like decentralized social networks.</p>
<p>I mean, we haven&rsquo;t talked a lot.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve talked a little bit about it,</p>
<p>but if you end up putting a regulatory hammer down</p>
<p>on Facebook and Twitter and telling them what consumers,</p>
<p>and remember, these guys aren&rsquo;t media creators.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re platforms effectively</p>
<p>for search discovery and access.</p>
<p>So you, as an individual,</p>
<p>can discover third-party content on their platform.</p>
<p>If they start putting the regulatory hammer down</p>
<p>on these quote-unquote platforms,</p>
<p>telling them what they can and cannot make available</p>
<p>to their users,</p>
<p>there will be another platform that will emerge.</p>
<p>And that platform may end up being</p>
<p>in this kind of decentralized model.</p>
<p>And in that decentralized model,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not gonna have the same degree</p>
<p>of regulatory oversight.</p>
<p>And that system will end up solving the same use case.</p>
<p>Eventually, consumers will get what they want,</p>
<p>which is what Chamath calls kind of this emotional response,</p>
<p>eliciting this emotional reaction.</p>
<p>They will consume it until they achieve</p>
<p>one of their kind of seven deadly sins objective,</p>
<p>which is what&rsquo;s driving the emotion,</p>
<p>underscoring their decisions on what to watch,</p>
<p>what to consume.</p>
<p>And there will be an alternative.</p>
<p>So go ahead and play whack-a-mole.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll play whack-a-mole for a few years,</p>
<p>maybe a few decades.</p>
<p>But at the end of the day,</p>
<p>digital technology in a connected world</p>
<p>will drive consumers to exactly</p>
<p>where they will naturally find themselves,</p>
<p>which is consuming ever more of the things</p>
<p>that create this emotional response in them.</p>
<p>The consequences are unfortunate.</p>
<p>You know, I don&rsquo;t know what the right solution is.</p>
<p>You know, we&rsquo;ve, to some degree,</p>
<p>put a regulatory hammer down on things like smoking</p>
<p>and in some places, things like sugar,</p>
<p>things that have kind of an obvious effect</p>
<p>on our physical health.</p>
<p>These other things that we&rsquo;re seeing now</p>
<p>are having an effect on our mental health.</p>
<p>And I think that there may be kind of an emerging</p>
<p>regulatory regime around mental health standards</p>
<p>and how much of things can be consumed.</p>
<p>And I think what we&rsquo;re seeing is the leading indicator</p>
<p>of this is what&rsquo;s gone on in China.</p>
<p>Because China is the nation that I would say</p>
<p>is probably at the forefront of research</p>
<p>and understanding of what the consequences are</p>
<p>of consuming more and more of media and content</p>
<p>that causes an emotional response to you</p>
<p>and what happens down the road,</p>
<p>isolation, loneliness, suicide rates go up,</p>
<p>unhappiness, et cetera.</p>
<p>It certainly is the consequence,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not a function of any individual company&rsquo;s</p>
<p>misconveyance of content to consumers.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a function of where these systems end up going</p>
<p>because of the way humans are biologically wired.</p>
<p>And so I guess my first concern is maybe we end up</p>
<p>in a decentralized system that ends up replacing</p>
<p>all of these tools and this just doesn&rsquo;t end,</p>
<p>or you end up having-</p>
<p>It could be worse.</p>
<p>And it could be worse,</p>
<p>or you end up having these kind of regulatory regimes</p>
<p>emerge-</p>
<p>No, that would be better.</p>
<p>A decentralized solution is actually better in one,</p>
<p>no, it&rsquo;s better in one key way,</p>
<p>which is that it&rsquo;s fundamentally harder</p>
<p>to create the exact same network effect and density</p>
<p>that you can have with one monolithic closed system.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re much more likely to actually</p>
<p>have a very fragmented ecosystem</p>
<p>of hundreds of different solutions,</p>
<p>depending on what of the sins you want to feed</p>
<p>or what of the feelings you want to feel at any one time.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a big assumption</p>
<p>that it would be a fragmented network.</p>
<p>If you did replicate Facebook on a decentralized platform</p>
<p>and then some piece of misinformation came out</p>
<p>and it trended all the way to number one,</p>
<p>like say the January 6th insurrection-</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>People brought guns to that.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not one network.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not one network.</p>
<p>I understand that, but if one-</p>
<p>Hold on, hold on.</p>
<p>Let me finish my point.</p>
<p>If one network became so large</p>
<p>and there was nobody who could turn off something,</p>
<p>what if people said,</p>
<p>hey, there&rsquo;s a riot going on at the Capitol</p>
<p>and more people showed up with more guns, right?</p>
<p>You have nobody to sit there and say,</p>
<p>hey, don&rsquo;t go to the Capitol,</p>
<p>turn those trending posts off.</p>
<p>Go ahead, Sax.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about this problem of misinformation.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s an old Mark Twain quote saying</p>
<p>that a lie can travel around the world faster</p>
<p>than the truth can put on its shoes.</p>
<p>Okay. Correct.</p>
<p>There is a problem of falsehoods spreading online.</p>
<p>I agree with you there.</p>
<p>The question is what you do about it.</p>
<p>And the problem we have right now</p>
<p>is that truth is in the eye of the beholder.</p>
<p>There is no truth API.</p>
<p>And so at the end of the day,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the people in power who get to decide</p>
<p>what is true and what is false</p>
<p>if you give them the power to censor misinformation.</p>
<p>Example, we just saw, we talked about in this program,</p>
<p>the Rolling Stone Ivermectin hoax,</p>
<p>provably false story.</p>
<p>And yet Rachel Maddow still had it up on her posts.</p>
<p>She was not sanctioned by MSNBC.</p>
<p>Twitter never told her to take it down</p>
<p>and she was not fact-checked.</p>
<p>However, the Hunter Biden laptop scandal or story,</p>
<p>which came out in the New York Post</p>
<p>a couple weeks before the election,</p>
<p>turned out to be a provably true story.</p>
<p>And yet it was taken down by Facebook and Twitter.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, this term of misinformation</p>
<p>is just another vector for partisan attack</p>
<p>and it will be used by whoever we give the power to</p>
<p>to decide what misinformation is.</p>
<p>So what is the answer then</p>
<p>to this point of falsehood spreading online?</p>
<p>Well, at the end of the day,</p>
<p>the answer to bad speech is more speech.</p>
<p>You try to create a free marketplace of ideas</p>
<p>to let the good speech</p>
<p>ultimately drive out the bad speech</p>
<p>or prove that it&rsquo;s wrong.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the best you can do.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the best you can do in a free society.</p>
<p>Yes, but this is the first time a free society</p>
<p>has had social networks</p>
<p>that can reach a billion people instantly in an hour.</p>
<p>So I think there&rsquo;s one differentiator there</p>
<p>that we must think of.</p>
<p>If somebody defames you on a social network,</p>
<p>they are absolutely liable.</p>
<p>I mean, you can sue them, okay?</p>
<p>But I think, and you should.</p>
<p>And I think we can-</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve talked about cancel culture.</p>
<p>People are destroyed</p>
<p>before they even get their day in court.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s being destroyed for something different.</p>
<p>I think if somebody-</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s because it trends.</p>
<p>If it couldn&rsquo;t trend to so many people,</p>
<p>it wouldn&rsquo;t lead to the cancellation</p>
<p>and destruction of somebody&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve talked about that many times yourself.</p>
<p>If somebody libels you, I think they should be,</p>
<p>you should be able to sue them.</p>
<p>And I think we could actually,</p>
<p>we could have a libel regime more like the UK,</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s easier to prove these cases in court</p>
<p>and people are much more careful</p>
<p>about defaming other people.</p>
<p>I would be very much in favor of that, okay?</p>
<p>Because defamation is not free speech.</p>
<p>But the question really is about,</p>
<p>really, we&rsquo;re talking about non-defamatory statements</p>
<p>that somebody in a position of power</p>
<p>has decided is not true.</p>
<p>Many of these statements are subjective.</p>
<p>Dave Portnoy got labeled for his subjective opinion</p>
<p>about AOC&rsquo;s dress.</p>
<p>Why did that happen?</p>
<p>And why is that kind of labeling only used</p>
<p>to protect one side of the political spectrum?</p>
<p>So, I mean, that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s really going on here.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s end with this.</p>
<p>Has anybody watched Chappelle&rsquo;s The Closer?</p>
<p>I did.</p>
<p>Incredible.</p>
<p>I watched it.</p>
<p>Pretty incredible.</p>
<p>I mean, fearless.</p>
<p>Fearless is a word.</p>
<p>I was really,</p>
<p>I think that he slightly missed it</p>
<p>because I think he could have really actually called out</p>
<p>cancel culture and woke as a more,</p>
<p>I think he kind of left it a little bit to me</p>
<p>where I was like a little,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I just didn&rsquo;t think they were as good as his other ones.</p>
<p>And I felt like he didn&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>make the point he wanted to make.</p>
<p>It was a little convoluted.</p>
<p>We need somebody who can actually stand up</p>
<p>and actually be more satirical</p>
<p>and tell the story of why all this cancel culture</p>
<p>and defamatory statements and judging people</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t make sense.</p>
<p>But then he didn&rsquo;t get the job done, I felt like.</p>
<p>Well, let me ask you this about the performance.</p>
<p>Did he seem qualitatively different than you in that</p>
<p>the other times he seemed very light on his feet,</p>
<p>having a good time, being a comedian,</p>
<p>and this time it felt like he was personally hurt</p>
<p>or he was-</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t comedy.</p>
<p>It felt less comedic, I agree.</p>
<p>It felt like he had an agenda.</p>
<p>He was hurt.</p>
<p>He wanted to get some stuff off his chest</p>
<p>and there were some jokes in between,</p>
<p>which is very different.</p>
<p>Like the percentage of jokes in this is like 20%</p>
<p>and the like heavy on-</p>
<p>Max.</p>
<p>Max, and then the other ones were 80% jokes,</p>
<p>20% social commentary.</p>
<p>This felt like he was actually really hurt</p>
<p>and like, I don&rsquo;t wanna say bitter,</p>
<p>but just fed up maybe, frustrated.</p>
<p>He had a chip, which made it interesting to me.</p>
<p>You know, in the early 2000s,</p>
<p>Chappelle for me was really important</p>
<p>because he was an advocate for minorities</p>
<p>and I felt seen and protected by Chappelle.</p>
<p>And I thought that was really important.</p>
<p>And then his comedy was just so sharp.</p>
<p>Oh yeah.</p>
<p>And I said, I just think that it was a little bit</p>
<p>of an opportunity lost.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I think if he had really actually taken it to its conclusion</p>
<p>he would have actually,</p>
<p>there was just too many uncomfortable moments in that thing.</p>
<p>It was super uncomfortable at times.</p>
<p>And I really would like to see it again</p>
<p>because if you just think about his career,</p>
<p>him talking about police brutality,</p>
<p>him talking about race in a very fearless,</p>
<p>entertaining, but also informative way</p>
<p>and just being a truth teller.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>This was so uncomfortable at times.</p>
<p>I agree with that.</p>
<p>I need to watch it again and I need to let it sit</p>
<p>because I was taking-</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s on Netflix?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s on Netflix.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the last in his contract.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, this could be,</p>
<p>I almost felt like he was trying to break Netflix</p>
<p>because he does seem to have a streak in him</p>
<p>where he&rsquo;s like, okay, I&rsquo;m walking away from Comedy Central</p>
<p>and he does seem to burn the boats.</p>
<p>This felt like he was burning the boats with Netflix to me.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you got that vibe where he was like,</p>
<p>this is the last one, I&rsquo;m being canceled after this.</p>
<p>Fuck y&rsquo;all, I&rsquo;m out.</p>
<p>And he has that, I mean, he torched it, Sax.</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;re going to watch this thing-</p>
<p>Well, now I&rsquo;m definitely watching it.</p>
<p>I have not seen it yet, but I&rsquo;m definitely watching it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll watch it tonight.</p>
<p>I give it a 50% chance that Netflix takes it down.</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s watch it quickly then.</p>
<p>Well, there were, everybody was screaming</p>
<p>for him to be deplatformed.</p>
<p>Everybody was screaming.</p>
<p>Well, then I like it even more.</p>
<p>You know, one of the ironic things</p>
<p>about these warning labels,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve noticed they&rsquo;ve started to become a badge of honor</p>
<p>where, you know, if the hall monitors at Twitter</p>
<p>are trying to label your tweet as, you know,</p>
<p>being incendiary, maybe it&rsquo;s just interesting, right?</p>
<p>Buy, it&rsquo;s a buy signal.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>So, you know, I was listening</p>
<p>to Antonio Garcia Martinez interview Camille on Call-In</p>
<p>and they labeled that, I mean, just the post</p>
<p>about they were going to have a conversation.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re saying the link to it was even flagged</p>
<p>as like, oh my Lord.</p>
<p>I think there needs to be a Netflix for a comedy</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s only subscription and it&rsquo;s owned</p>
<p>by the comedians.</p>
<p>Like if Dave Chappelle were to create his own Netflix,</p>
<p>I think it gets 10 million paid subscribers</p>
<p>in the first two years.</p>
<p>Overnight, now overnight.</p>
<p>Overnight.</p>
<p>Okay, so wait a second.</p>
<p>How do we wet our beaks on this?</p>
<p>If we go to Chappelle and we say, hey, listen,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s $25 million.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll set up the tech team.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll set up the comedians.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll ask K Hart.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll ask him this weekend.</p>
<p>I think that, yeah, you get K Hart,</p>
<p>you get Chappelle, you get Seinfeld,</p>
<p>you get, now, do you get Louis CK in there?</p>
<p>Or CK, what&rsquo;s his name?</p>
<p>I never found that guy funny.</p>
<p>That guy never did it for me.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, anyway.</p>
<p>You know who&rsquo;s funny?</p>
<p>You know who&rsquo;s funny?</p>
<p>Have you had this Asian guy, Ronnie Chang?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s on, there&rsquo;s a great Netflix special on him.</p>
<p>He is fucking funny.</p>
<p>And then Joe Koi.</p>
<p>Joe Koi is very funny.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think Ronnie Chang taped his own special.</p>
<p>Hassan Minhaj, that guy&rsquo;s very funny.</p>
<p>Yeah, he&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s legit.</p>
<p>But I mean, this would be a great way</p>
<p>for them to just control their destiny</p>
<p>and not have to worry about cancel culture.</p>
<p>Because I think a lot of the folks who are on.</p>
<p>Well, they are probably the last line of people</p>
<p>that actually will be the defenders of free speech.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s pretty scary.</p>
<p>As much as I think Facebook should be more thoughtful</p>
<p>about their algorithm, you know,</p>
<p>back to, you know, circling Netflix</p>
<p>and censorship back to the Facebook issues.</p>
<p>I just think Facebook should say,</p>
<p>hey, listen, we&rsquo;ve throttled the algorithm</p>
<p>so that any one piece of content</p>
<p>can only reach this many people over this period of time.</p>
<p>And yeah, sure.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s gonna lower our time on site or whatever.</p>
<p>But we want things to have a little bit of time</p>
<p>to spread and get fact-checked.</p>
<p>Does anybody think that that&rsquo;s a good idea to say,</p>
<p>just, you know, if you&rsquo;re trying to cancel somebody</p>
<p>instead of it going to number one on trending topics</p>
<p>before the person has a trial,</p>
<p>that the algorithm would just take a little bit of time</p>
<p>to propagate content?</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what I can tell you conclusively.</p>
<p>If Facebook wanted to solve these issues</p>
<p>in the ways that the government expects in their head</p>
<p>for these problems to be solved,</p>
<p>Facebook market cap would be $250 billion</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;d have a million people</p>
<p>working there at the company.</p>
<p>So this is not an issue of whether it&rsquo;s possible.</p>
<p>The question is, is it right?</p>
<p>And does it actually get at the solution</p>
<p>or does it just, as Friedberg said,</p>
<p>create whack-a-mole someplace else?</p>
<p>And so, you know, I don&rsquo;t know what obliterating</p>
<p>three quarters of a trillion dollars of market cap will do,</p>
<p>but I suspect that the government is gonna want to find out.</p>
<p>Sachs, do you think that throttling</p>
<p>the velocity of the algorithm</p>
<p>so that news doesn&rsquo;t spread as fast and violently,</p>
<p>which could be misinformation, could be valid information,</p>
<p>do you think that&rsquo;s a possible solution?</p>
<p>Look, I think that at the end of the day,</p>
<p>with both-</p>
<p>Or disclosing the algorithm maybe?</p>
<p>With both Facebook and Twitter,</p>
<p>you only see stuff from people who you&rsquo;re following</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re friends with.</p>
<p>Not true.</p>
<p>What do you mean?</p>
<p>If things, they will insert stuff</p>
<p>into your Twitter algorithm now that&rsquo;s adjacent to you</p>
<p>and Facebook will do that as well.</p>
<p>Well, maybe if people respond</p>
<p>to someone who you&rsquo;re following,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve never seen anything in my Twitter feed</p>
<p>other than an ad that&rsquo;s not from somebody I follow, so-</p>
<p>You never went to trending topics?</p>
<p>No, I mean, not in my feed.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t hit the Explorer feed?</p>
<p>Oh, okay, no, but the Explorer feed&rsquo;s right there</p>
<p>and they are surfacing things in your feed now</p>
<p>that are not people you follow, but anyway, keep going.</p>
<p>What they&rsquo;re really doing, okay,</p>
<p>is there&rsquo;s a universe of people who you&rsquo;re following</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re friends with,</p>
<p>and you could just see all of that content</p>
<p>in a reverse chronological feed,</p>
<p>but that would be too much.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d be overwhelming.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how it originally worked, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly, and I get it, and that was fine.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t, I liked it, okay,</p>
<p>but as you&rsquo;re following thousands of people now,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s too much content,</p>
<p>and so they will simply surface the tweets</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re most likely to want to interact with.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe, by the way,</p>
<p>that those tweets are necessarily the ones</p>
<p>that make you angry.</p>
<p>I think for some people it is, clearly,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not, certainly not the case in my case.</p>
<p>What I would say is it&rsquo;s more refined than that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the tweets that you think are interesting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the tweets that perhaps express a sense of outrage</p>
<p>that agrees with your sense of outrage.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little different than anger,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s basically the subset of content</p>
<p>that you, through your reveal preferences,</p>
<p>have shown Facebook or Twitter</p>
<p>that you care about the most,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s basically what they&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re giving the consumer more of what they want,</p>
<p>and I think that we&rsquo;ve blown this thing</p>
<p>so far out of proportion.</p>
<p>I mean, yeah, there&rsquo;s an analogy that it&rsquo;s addictive,</p>
<p>but I think that it&rsquo;s been blown so far out of proportion,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve exaggerated the fear beyond any reasonable recognition.</p>
<p>By the way, I think the reason that that tweet was flagged,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m guessing, is that in the tweet,</p>
<p>Kemele says he&rsquo;s gonna talk about critical race theory,</p>
<p>and that may be why Twitter said,</p>
<p>well, Twitter just said that conversations like this</p>
<p>can be intense, that&rsquo;s all it said.</p>
<p>I think because he says the gloves are coming off,</p>
<p>it looks like two people fighting or whatever.</p>
<p>I just think it&rsquo;s sort of ridiculous.</p>
<p>Like, this is where the warning label stuff-</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little patriarchal, yes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little condescending.</p>
<p>Like, you can&rsquo;t handle this content.</p>
<p>Patronizing, I think is the word you would use.</p>
<p>Patronizing, yeah.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not circling that.</p>
<p>I got the thesaurus up here, I&rsquo;m not dumb.</p>
<p>Hey, I got a thesaurus here.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m smart, I&rsquo;m smart.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very palindromic.</p>
<p>You should have looked out for me.</p>
<p>You was my brother, Sax.</p>
<p>I find it a little like, could have been a contender,</p>
<p>instead of what I am.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m smart, not like they say.</p>
<p>Not dumb, smart.</p>
<p>How&rsquo;d you get your fucking sunshine, boss?</p>
<p>Oh, shit.</p>
<p>Boys, I love you.</p>
<p>Happy 50th episode.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s going on with you, Friedberg and Sax,</p>
<p>that you won&rsquo;t make the journey down to the poker game?</p>
<p>Is this like some sort of David protest here, you guys?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re playing No Limit.</p>
<p>The robots are protesting.</p>
<p>I will come back, I will start playing again,</p>
<p>if we get the game going on like a regular time.</p>
<p>What the fuck is on your schedule?</p>
<p>What are you talking about?</p>
<p>You have nothing going on.</p>
<p>Come the fuck on.</p>
<p>Yeah, you have nothing going on, Sax.</p>
<p>All right, I&rsquo;ll start, you know, I&rsquo;ll start making,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll start coming down.</p>
<p>Stop evading your family, stay in the city, come the fuck on.</p>
<p>See your fucking friends, buy some cars,</p>
<p>lose some money.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not playing PLL.</p>
<p>Yeah, no PLL.</p>
<p>I mean, we did at the end, just to get Skye&rsquo;s money,</p>
<p>but just to keep Skye there for another 30 minutes,</p>
<p>since he was flushing cash.</p>
<p>Beat him up real good, Saxie Poo, we beat him up real good.</p>
<p>Ooh, it was Skyfall.</p>
<p>When you crumble.</p>
<p>Actually, the new, I&rsquo;m really excited to see</p>
<p>the new Daniel Craig 007.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t believe that.</p>
<p>Can you still rent a mid-tower movie theater</p>
<p>for like 50 bucks?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>300 bucks, so yeah.</p>
<p>It used to be not, it was 99 during the pandemic.</p>
<p>It was awesome, I did it a few times.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s 300 now, and I haven&rsquo;t done it the last two times</p>
<p>I went with the girls,</p>
<p>because it was first run movies</p>
<p>and the theaters were pretty empty.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s like 300.</p>
<p>If you get like 10 of your friends to come,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like basically the same price as a ticket.</p>
<p>If you get five of your friends to come, it&rsquo;s worth it.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s 60 bucks each, and yeah, I mean, it&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Or we just go to Sax&rsquo;s theater, he&rsquo;s got.</p>
<p>The Sax&rsquo;s theater is better because you have a chef there</p>
<p>who will make your food, but yeah.</p>
<p>And for those of you asking about the all-in summit,</p>
<p>Sax and I are leading the charge for a February or April.</p>
<p>We got a couple of locations.</p>
<p>Thank you to everybody who sent us location ideas.</p>
<p>Two days, 250 people, 200 paid tickets, 50 by scholarship.</p>
<p>And you can go to the all-in website.</p>
<p>When we have information, we will post it there,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re just in the planning phase right now.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;re thinking two days, right boys?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Two days for all-in summit and then five hours of content,</p>
<p>something like that a day.</p>
<p>We each interview people.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And then we&rsquo;re done.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And Miami is the host city and we&rsquo;ll draw a high card</p>
<p>for who picks the next city.</p>
<p>Chamath, you said you&rsquo;re picking something in Italy.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to probably pick my.</p>
<p>Rome or Venice.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to probably pick New York for mine or Austin.</p>
<p>And then Freeburg, where would you pick?</p>
<p>Napa or something?</p>
<p>Marin County.</p>
<p>Oh, wow.</p>
<p>Where everybody wants to go.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>Go to anti-vaxxer town.</p>
<p>Fuck you, Freeburg.</p>
<p>Marin County.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>What a destination.</p>
<p>Freeburg, where would you pick?</p>
<p>Where would you pick?</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re doing Miami first, is that right?</p>
<p>Miami&rsquo;s first and we draw a high card for the next city.</p>
<p>Who gets to pick next city?</p>
<p>Each bestie picks for four years.</p>
<p>Each buddy picks one.</p>
<p>If we go twice a year, even better.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;d probably split it between London and.</p>
<p>Ooh.</p>
<p>Ooh.</p>
<p>London and somewhere in Hawaii.</p>
<p>Ooh.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>Good choices.</p>
<p>Hawaii, yeah.</p>
<p>Hawaii&rsquo;s an inspired choice.</p>
<p>Can you imagine 250 degenerate?</p>
<p>London&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>Iconic classic, but London would be,</p>
<p>we would take over.</p>
<p>We would take over.</p>
<p>Miami is freaking out.</p>
<p>Run over Annabelle&rsquo;s boys.</p>
<p>I bring you all to Annabelle.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s incredible.</p>
<p>That members club is, I think,</p>
<p>the most over the top thing I&rsquo;ve ever seen.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re referencing something</p>
<p>that no one knows what you&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>Nobody knows what you&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>Is that a nightclub?</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s a nightclub.</p>
<p>Private club?</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s a private.</p>
<p>Annabelle&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a lady I know.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s down in the West End.</p>
<p>No, you have to have members clubs in London</p>
<p>because you can&rsquo;t drink alcohol after like 9 p.m.</p>
<p>unless it&rsquo;s a private club.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>All right, we&rsquo;ll see you all next time</p>
<p>on the All In podcast.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s to another 50, everybody.</p>
<p>First 50 done.</p>
<p>Love you guys.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s get another 50 in the book.</p>
<p>All In.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll let your winners ride.</p>
<p>Rain Man, David Saks.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going All In.</p>
<p>And it said we open sourced it to the fans</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ve just gone crazy with it.</p>
<p>Love you, West End.</p>
<p>The queen of quinoa.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going All In.</p>
<p>Let your winners ride.</p>
<p>Let your winners ride.</p>
<p>Let your winners ride.</p>
<p>Besties are gone.</p>
<p>I hope they&rsquo;re dead.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my dog taking a notice in your driveway.</p>
<p>Saks.</p>
<p>Winner.</p>
<p>Oh, man.</p>
<p>Oh, man.</p>
<p>My avatar will meet me at Wednesday.</p>
<p>We should all just get a room</p>
<p>and just have one big huge orgy</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re all just useless.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like sexual tension</p>
<p>that they just need to release somehow.</p>
<p>Wet your feet.</p>
<p>Wet your feet.</p>
<p>Wet your feet.</p>
<p>Feet.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s gonna be good.</p>
<p>We need to get merch.</p>
<p>Besties are back.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going All In.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going All In.</p>
