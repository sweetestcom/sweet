    <p>The following is a conversation with Charles Isbell</p>
<p>and Michael Whitman.</p>
<p>Charles is the Dean of the College of Computing</p>
<p>at Georgia Tech and Michael is a computer science professor</p>
<p>at Brown University.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve spoken with each of them individually on this podcast</p>
<p>and since they are good friends in real life,</p>
<p>we all thought it would be fun</p>
<p>to have a conversation together.</p>
<p>Quick mention of each sponsor,</p>
<p>followed by some thoughts related to the episode.</p>
<p>Thank you to Athletic Greens,</p>
<p>the all in one drink that I start every day with</p>
<p>to cover all my nutritional bases.</p>
<p>Eight Sleep, a mattress that cools itself</p>
<p>and gives me yet another reason to enjoy sleep.</p>
<p>Masterclass, online courses</p>
<p>from some of the most amazing humans in history</p>
<p>and Cash App, the app I use to send money to friends.</p>
<p>Please check out the sponsors in the description</p>
<p>to get a discount and to support this podcast.</p>
<p>As a side note, let me say that having two guests</p>
<p>on the podcast is an experiment</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve been meaning to do for a while.</p>
<p>In particular, because down the road,</p>
<p>I would like to occasionally be a kind of moderator</p>
<p>for debates between people that may disagree</p>
<p>in some interesting ways.</p>
<p>If you have suggestions for who you would like to see debate</p>
<p>on this podcast, let me know.</p>
<p>As with all experiments of this kind,</p>
<p>it is a learning process.</p>
<p>Both the video and the audio might need improvement.</p>
<p>I realized I think I should probably do</p>
<p>three or more cameras next time</p>
<p>as opposed to just two.</p>
<p>And also try different ways to mount the microphone</p>
<p>for the third person.</p>
<p>Also, after recording this intro,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to have to go figure out the thumbnail</p>
<p>for the video version of the podcast</p>
<p>since I usually put the guest&rsquo;s head on the thumbnail.</p>
<p>And now there&rsquo;s two heads and two names</p>
<p>to try to fit into the thumbnail.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a kind of a bin packing problem</p>
<p>which in theoretical computer science</p>
<p>happens to be an NP hard problem.</p>
<p>Whatever I come up with, if you have better ideas</p>
<p>for the thumbnail, let me know as well.</p>
<p>And in general, I always welcome ideas</p>
<p>how this thing can be improved.</p>

<p>And now here&rsquo;s my conversation with Charles Isbell</p>
<p>and Michael Littman.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll probably disagree about this question,</p>
<p>but what is your biggest, would you say, disagreement</p>
<p>about either something profound and very important</p>
<p>or something completely not important at all?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think we have any disagreements at all.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>We walked into that one, didn&rsquo;t we?</p>
<p>So one thing that you sometimes mention is that,</p>
<p>and we did this one on air too, as it were,</p>
<p>whether or not machine learning</p>
<p>is computational statistics.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>But it is.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>And in particular, and more importantly,</p>
<p>it is not just computational statistics.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s missing in the picture?</p>
<p>All the rest of it.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s missing?</p>
<p>That which is missing.</p>
<p>Oh, yes, well, you can&rsquo;t be wrong now.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s not just the statistics.</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t even believe this.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve had this conversation before.</p>
<p>If it were just the statistics,</p>
<p>then we would be happy with where we are.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not just the statistics.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s computational statistics.</p>
<p>Or if it were just the computational.</p>
<p>I agree that machine learning is not just statistics.</p>
<p>It is not just statistics.</p>
<p>We can agree on that.</p>
<p>Nor is it just computational statistics.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s computational statistics.</p>
<p>It is computational.</p>
<p>What is the computational and computational statistics?</p>
<p>Does this take us into the realm of computing?</p>
<p>It does, but I think perhaps the way I can get him</p>
<p>to admit that he&rsquo;s wrong is that it&rsquo;s about rules.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about rules.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about symbols.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about all these other things.</p>
<p>But statistics is not about rules?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna say statistics is about rules.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not just the statistics, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just a random variable that you choose</p>
<p>and you have a probability.</p>
<p>I think you have a narrow view of statistics.</p>
<p>Okay, well then what would be the broad view of statistics</p>
<p>that would still allow it to be statistics</p>
<p>and not say history that would make</p>
<p>computational statistics okay?</p>
<p>Well, okay, so I had my first sort of research mentor,</p>
<p>a guy named Tom Landauer,</p>
<p>taught me to do some statistics, right?</p>
<p>And I was annoyed all the time</p>
<p>because the statistics would say</p>
<p>that what I was doing was not statistically significant.</p>
<p>And I was like, but, but, and basically what he said to me</p>
<p>is statistics is how you&rsquo;re gonna keep</p>
<p>from lying to yourself, which I thought was really deep.</p>
<p>It is a way to keep yourself honest in a particular way.</p>
<p>I agree with that.</p>
<p>Yeah, and so you&rsquo;re trying to find rules.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just gonna bring it back to rules.</p>
<p>Wait, wait, wait, could you possibly try to define rules?</p>
<p>Even regular statisticians, noncomputational statisticians,</p>
<p>do spend some of their time evaluating rules, right?</p>
<p>Applying statistics to try to understand</p>
<p>does this rule capture this?</p>
<p>Does this not capture that?</p>
<p>You mean like hypothesis testing kind of thing?</p>
<p>Or like confidence intervals?</p>
<p>I think more like hypothesis.</p>
<p>Like I feel like the word statistic</p>
<p>literally means like a summary,</p>
<p>like a number that summarizes other numbers.</p>
<p>But I think the field of statistics</p>
<p>actually applies that idea to things like rules,</p>
<p>to understand whether or not a rule is valid.</p>
<p>Does software engineering statistics?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Programming languages statistics?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Because I think there&rsquo;s a very,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s useful to think about a lot of what AI</p>
<p>and machine learning is or certainly should be</p>
<p>as software engineering, as programming languages.</p>
<p>Just to put it in language that you might understand,</p>
<p>the hyperparameters beyond the problem itself.</p>
<p>The hyperparameters is too many syllables</p>
<p>for me to understand.</p>
<p>The hyperparameters.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s better.</p>
<p>That goes around it, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the decisions you choose to make.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the metrics you choose to use.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the loss function.</p>
<p>You wanna say the practice of machine learning</p>
<p>is different than the practice of statistics.</p>
<p>Like the things you have to worry about</p>
<p>and how you worry about them are different,</p>
<p>therefore they&rsquo;re different.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>At a very little, I mean, at the very least.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that much is true.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t mean that statistics,</p>
<p>computational or otherwise aren&rsquo;t important.</p>
<p>I think they are.</p>
<p>I mean, I do a lot of that, for example.</p>
<p>But I think it goes beyond that.</p>
<p>I think that we could think about game theory</p>
<p>in terms of statistics,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s very as useful to do.</p>
<p>I mean, the way I would think about it</p>
<p>or a way I would think about it is this way.</p>
<p>Chemistry is just physics.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s as useful to think about chemistry</p>
<p>as being just physics.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s useful to think about it as chemistry.</p>
<p>The level of abstraction really matters here.</p>
<p>So I think it is,</p>
<p>there are contexts in which it is useful.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I think of it that way, right?</p>
<p>So finding that connection is actually helpful.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s when I emphasize</p>
<p>the computational statistics thing.</p>
<p>I think I want to befriend statistics and not absorb them.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the A way to think about it</p>
<p>beyond what I just said, right?</p>
<p>So what would you say,</p>
<p>and I want you to think back to a conversation</p>
<p>we had a very long time ago.</p>
<p>What would you say is the difference between,</p>
<p>say, the early 2000s, ICML</p>
<p>and what we used to call NIPS, NeurIPS?</p>
<p>Is there a difference?</p>
<p>A lot of, particularly on the machine learning</p>
<p>that was done there?</p>
<p>ICML was around that long.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>So iClear is the new conference, newish.</p>
<p>Yeah, I guess so.</p>
<p>And ICML was around the 2000.</p>
<p>So ICML predates that.</p>
<p>I think my most cited ICML paper is from 94.</p>
<p>Michael knows this better than me</p>
<p>because, of course, he&rsquo;s significantly older than I am.</p>
<p>But the point is, what is the difference</p>
<p>between ICML and NeurIPS in the late 90s, early 2000s?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what everyone else&rsquo;s perspective would be,</p>
<p>but I had a particular perspective at that time,</p>
<p>which is I felt like ICML was more</p>
<p>of a computer science place</p>
<p>and that NIPS, NeurIPS was more of an engineering place,</p>
<p>like the kind of math that happened at the two places.</p>
<p>As a computer scientist,</p>
<p>I felt more comfortable with the ICML math.</p>
<p>And the NeurIPS people would say</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;m dumb.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s such an engineering thing to say, so.</p>
<p>I agree with that part of it,</p>
<p>but I do it a little differently.</p>
<p>We actually had a nice conversation</p>
<p>with Tom Dietrich about this in public.</p>
<p>On Twitter just a couple of days ago.</p>
<p>I put it a little differently,</p>
<p>which is that ICML was machine learning done</p>
<p>by a computer scientist.</p>
<p>And NeurIPS was machine learning done</p>
<p>by a computer scientist trying to impress statisticians.</p>
<p>Which was weird because it was the same people,</p>
<p>at least by the time I started paying attention.</p>
<p>But it just felt very, very different.</p>
<p>And I think that that perspective</p>
<p>of whether you&rsquo;re trying to impress the statisticians</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re trying to impress the programmers</p>
<p>is actually very different and has real impact</p>
<p>on what you choose to worry about</p>
<p>and what kind of outcomes you come to.</p>
<p>So I think it really matters.</p>
<p>I think computational statistics is a means to an end.</p>
<p>It is not an end in some sense.</p>
<p>And I think that really matters here</p>
<p>in the same way that I don&rsquo;t think computer science</p>
<p>is just engineering or just science</p>
<p>or just math or whatever.</p>
<p>Okay, so I&rsquo;d have to now agree</p>
<p>that now we agree on everything.</p>
<p>Yes, yes.</p>
<p>The important thing here is that</p>
<p>my opinions may have changed,</p>
<p>but not the fact that I&rsquo;m right,</p>
<p>I think is what we just came to.</p>
<p>Right, and my opinions may have changed</p>
<p>and not the fact that I&rsquo;m wrong.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>You lost me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not even.</p>
<p>I think I lost myself there too.</p>
<p>But anyway, we&rsquo;re back.</p>
<p>This happens to us sometimes.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re sorry.</p>
<p>How does neural networks change this,</p>
<p>just to even linger on this topic,</p>
<p>change this idea of statistics,</p>
<p>how big of a pie statistics is</p>
<p>within the machine learning thing?</p>
<p>Like, because it sounds like hyperparameters</p>
<p>and also just the role of data.</p>
<p>You know, people are starting to use</p>
<p>this terminology of software 2.0,</p>
<p>which is like the act of programming</p>
<p>as a, like you&rsquo;re a designer</p>
<p>in the hyperparameter space of neural networks,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re also the collector and the organizer</p>
<p>and the cleaner of the data,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s part of the programming.</p>
<p>So how did, on the NeurIPS versus ICML topic,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the role of neural networks</p>
<p>in redefining the size and the role of machine learning?</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t wait to hear what Michael thinks about this,</p>
<p>but I would add one.</p>
<p>But you will.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true, I will, I&rsquo;ll force myself to.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s one other thing</p>
<p>I would add to your description,</p>
<p>which is the kind of software engineering part</p>
<p>of what does it mean to debug, for example.</p>
<p>But this is a difference between</p>
<p>the kind of computational statistics view</p>
<p>of machine learning and the computational view</p>
<p>of machine learning, which is, I think,</p>
<p>one is worried about the equation, as it were.</p>
<p>And by the way, this is not a value judgment.</p>
<p>I just think it&rsquo;s about perspective.</p>
<p>But the kind of questions you would ask</p>
<p>when you start asking yourself,</p>
<p>well, what does it mean to program</p>
<p>and develop and build the system,</p>
<p>is a very computer sciencey view of the problem.</p>
<p>I mean, if you get on data science Twitter</p>
<p>and econ Twitter, you actually hear this a lot</p>
<p>with the economist and the data scientist</p>
<p>complaining about the machine learning people.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s just statistics,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t know why they don&rsquo;t see this.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re not even asking the same questions.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not thinking about it</p>
<p>as a kind of programming problem.</p>
<p>And I think that that really matters,</p>
<p>just asking this question.</p>
<p>I actually think it&rsquo;s a little different</p>
<p>from programming in hyperparameter space</p>
<p>and sort of collecting the data.</p>
<p>But I do think that that immersion really matters.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll give you a quick example</p>
<p>of the way I think about this.</p>
<p>So I teach machine learning.</p>
<p>Michael and I have co taught a machine learning class,</p>
<p>which has now reached, I don&rsquo;t know, 10,000 people at least</p>
<p>over the last several years, or somewhere there&rsquo;s abouts.</p>
<p>And my machine learning assignments are of this form.</p>
<p>So the first one is something like,</p>
<p>implement these five algorithms,</p>
<p>KNN and SVMs and boosting and decision trees</p>
<p>and neural networks, and maybe that&rsquo;s it, I can&rsquo;t remember.</p>
<p>And when I say implement, I mean steal the code.</p>
<p>I am completely uninterested.</p>
<p>You get zero points for getting the thing to work.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want you spending your time worrying about</p>
<p>getting the corner case right of what happens</p>
<p>when you are trying to normalize distances</p>
<p>and the points on the thing.</p>
<p>And so you divide by zero.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not interested in that, right?</p>
<p>Steal the code.</p>
<p>However, you&rsquo;re going to run those algorithms</p>
<p>on two data sets.</p>
<p>The data sets have to be interesting.</p>
<p>What does it mean to be interesting?</p>
<p>Well, data sets interesting if it reveals differences</p>
<p>between algorithms, which presumably are all the same</p>
<p>because they can represent whatever they can represent.</p>
<p>And two data sets are interesting together</p>
<p>if they show different differences, as it were.</p>
<p>And you have to analyze them.</p>
<p>You have to justify their interestingness</p>
<p>and you have to analyze them in a whole bunch of ways.</p>
<p>But all I care about is the data in your analysis,</p>
<p>not the programming.</p>
<p>And I occasionally end up in these long discussions</p>
<p>with students, well, I don&rsquo;t really,</p>
<p>I copy and paste the things that I&rsquo;ve said</p>
<p>the other 15,000 times it&rsquo;s come up,</p>
<p>which is they go, but the only way to learn,</p>
<p>really understand is to code them up,</p>
<p>which is a very programmer,</p>
<p>software engineering view of the world.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t program it, you don&rsquo;t understand it,</p>
<p>which is, by the way, I think is wrong</p>
<p>in a very specific way.</p>
<p>But it is a way that you come to understand</p>
<p>because then you have to wrestle with the algorithm.</p>
<p>But the thing about machine learning</p>
<p>is it&rsquo;s not just sorting numbers</p>
<p>where in some sense the data doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>What matters is, well, does the algorithm work</p>
<p>on these abstract things, one less than the other?</p>
<p>In machine learning, the data matters.</p>
<p>It matters more than almost anything.</p>
<p>And not everything, but almost anything.</p>
<p>And so as a result, you have to live with the data</p>
<p>and don&rsquo;t get distracted by the algorithm per se.</p>
<p>And I think that that focus on the data</p>
<p>and what it can tell you</p>
<p>and what question it&rsquo;s actually answering for you</p>
<p>as opposed to the question you thought you were asking</p>
<p>is a key and important thing about machine learning</p>
<p>and is a way that computationalists</p>
<p>as opposed to statisticians bring a particular view</p>
<p>about how to think about the process.</p>
<p>The statisticians, by contrast, bring,</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;d be willing to say,</p>
<p>a better view about the kind of formal math that&rsquo;s behind it</p>
<p>and what an actual number ultimately is saying</p>
<p>about the data.</p>
<p>And those are both important, but they&rsquo;re also different.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t really think of it this way</p>
<p>is to build intuition about the role of data,</p>
<p>the different characteristics of data</p>
<p>by having two data sets that are different</p>
<p>and they reveal the differences in the differences.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a really fascinating,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a really interesting educational approach.</p>
<p>The students love it, but not right away.</p>
<p>No, they love it at the end.</p>
<p>They love it later.</p>
<p>They love it at the end.</p>
<p>Not at the beginning.</p>
<p>Not even immediately after.</p>
<p>I feel like there&rsquo;s a deep profound lesson</p>
<p>about education there.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That you can&rsquo;t listen to students</p>
<p>about whether what you&rsquo;re doing is the right</p>
<p>or the wrong thing.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, as a wise, Michael Lippmann once said to me</p>
<p>about children, which I think applies to teaching,</p>
<p>is you have to give them what they need</p>
<p>without bending to their will.</p>
<p>And students are like that.</p>
<p>You have to figure out what they need.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a curator.</p>
<p>Your whole job is to curate and to present</p>
<p>because on their own,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not gonna necessarily know where to search.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re providing pushes in some direction</p>
<p>and learn space and you have to give them what they need</p>
<p>in a way that keeps them engaged enough</p>
<p>so that they eventually discover what they want</p>
<p>and they get the tools they need to go</p>
<p>and learn other things off of.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your view?</p>
<p>Let me put on my Russian hat,</p>
<p>which believes that life is suffering.</p>
<p>I like Russian hats, by the way.</p>
<p>If you have one, I would like this.</p>
<p>Those are ridiculous, yes.</p>
<p>But in a delightful way.</p>
<p>But sure.</p>
<p>What do you think is the role of,</p>
<p>we talked about balance a little bit.</p>
<p>What do you think is the role of hardship in education?</p>
<p>Like I think the biggest things I&rsquo;ve learned,</p>
<p>like what made me fall in love with math, for example,</p>
<p>is by being bad at it until I got good at it.</p>
<p>So like struggling with a problem,</p>
<p>which increased the level of joy I felt</p>
<p>when I finally figured it out.</p>
<p>And it always felt with me, with teachers,</p>
<p>especially modern discussions of education,</p>
<p>how can we make education more fun,</p>
<p>more engaging, more all those things?</p>
<p>Or from my perspective, it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re maybe missing the point</p>
<p>that education, that life is suffering.</p>
<p>Education is supposed to be hard</p>
<p>and that actually what increases the joy you feel</p>
<p>when you actually learn something.</p>
<p>Is that ridiculous?</p>
<p>Do you like to see your students suffer?</p>
<p>Okay, so this may be a point where we differ.</p>
<p>I suspect not.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna do go on.</p>
<p>Well, what would your answer be?</p>
<p>I wanna hear you first.</p>
<p>Okay, well, I was gonna not answer the question.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want the students to know you enjoy them suffering?</p>
<p>No, no, no, no, no, no.</p>
<p>I was gonna say that there&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a distinction that you can make</p>
<p>in the kind of suffering, right?</p>
<p>So I think you can be in a mode</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re suffering in a hopeless way</p>
<p>versus you&rsquo;re suffering in a hopeful way, right?</p>
<p>Where you&rsquo;re like, you can see that if you,</p>
<p>that you still have,</p>
<p>you can still imagine getting to the end, right?</p>
<p>And as long as people are in that mindset</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re struggling,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not a hopeless kind of struggling,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s productive.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s really helpful.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s struggling, like if you break their will,</p>
<p>if you leave them hopeless.</p>
<p>No, that don&rsquo;t, sure, some people are gonna,</p>
<p>whatever, lift themselves up by their bootstraps,</p>
<p>but like mostly you give up</p>
<p>and certainly it takes the joy out of it.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re not gonna spend a lot of time</p>
<p>on something that brings you no joy.</p>
<p>So it is a bit of a delicate balance, right?</p>
<p>You have to thwart people in a way</p>
<p>that they still believe that there&rsquo;s a way through.</p>
<p>Right, so that&rsquo;s a, we strongly agree actually.</p>
<p>So I think, well, first off,</p>
<p>struggling and suffering aren&rsquo;t the same thing, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, just being poetic.</p>
<p>Oh, no, no, I actually appreciate the poetry.</p>
<p>And one of the reasons I appreciate it</p>
<p>is that they are often the same thing</p>
<p>and often quite different, right?</p>
<p>So you can struggle without suffering,</p>
<p>you can certainly suffer pretty easily.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t necessarily have to struggle to suffer.</p>
<p>So I think that you want people to struggle,</p>
<p>but that hope matters.</p>
<p>You have to, they have to understand</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re gonna get through it on the other side.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s very easy to confuse the two.</p>
<p>I actually think Brown University has a very,</p>
<p>just philosophically has a very different take</p>
<p>on the relationship with their students,</p>
<p>particularly undergrads from say a place like Georgia Tech,</p>
<p>which is.</p>
<p>Which university is better?</p>
<p>Well, I have my opinions on that.</p>
<p>I mean, remember, Charles said,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t matter what the facts are, I&rsquo;m always right.</p>
<p>The correct answer is that it doesn&rsquo;t matter,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re different.</p>
<p>But clearly, clearly the answer is different.</p>
<p>He went to a school like the school</p>
<p>where he is as an undergrad.</p>
<p>I went to a school, specifically the same school,</p>
<p>though it was changed a bit in the intervening years.</p>
<p>Brown or Georgia Tech?</p>
<p>No, I was talking about Georgia Tech.</p>
<p>And I went to an undergrad place</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a lot like the place where I work now.</p>
<p>And so it does seem like we&rsquo;re more familiar</p>
<p>with these models.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a similarity between Brown and Yale?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think they&rsquo;re quite similar, yeah.</p>
<p>And Duke.</p>
<p>Duke has some similarities too,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s got a little Southern draw.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve kind of worked your,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve sort of worked at universities</p>
<p>that are like the places where you learned.</p>
<p>And the same would be true for me.</p>
<p>Are you uncomfortable venturing outside the box?</p>
<p>Is that what you&rsquo;re saying?</p>
<p>Journeying out?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not what I&rsquo;m saying.</p>
<p>Yeah, Charles is definitely.</p>
<p>He only goes to places</p>
<p>that have institute in the name, right?</p>
<p>It has worked out that way.</p>
<p>Well, academic places anyway.</p>
<p>Well, no, I was a visiting scientist at UPenn</p>
<p>or visiting something at UPenn.</p>
<p>Oh, wow, I just understood your joke.</p>
<p>Which one?</p>
<p>Five minutes later.</p>
<p>I like to set the sort of time bomb.</p>
<p>The institute is in the,</p>
<p>that Charles only goes to places</p>
<p>that have institute in the name.</p>
<p>So I guess Georgia,</p>
<p>I forget that Georgia Tech</p>
<p>is Georgia Institute of Technology.</p>
<p>The number of people who refer to it</p>
<p>as Georgia Tech University is large</p>
<p>and incredibly irritating.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of the few things</p>
<p>that genuinely gets under my skin.</p>
<p>But like schools like Georgia Tech and MIT</p>
<p>have as part of the ethos,</p>
<p>like there is,</p>
<p>I wanna say there&rsquo;s an abbreviation</p>
<p>that someone taught me,</p>
<p>like IHTFP, something like that.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s an expression</p>
<p>which is basically I hate being here,</p>
<p>which they say so proudly.</p>
<p>And that is definitely not the ethos at Brown.</p>
<p>Like Brown is,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a little more pampering</p>
<p>and empowerment and stuff.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not like we&rsquo;re gonna crush you</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re gonna love it.</p>
<p>So yeah, I think there&rsquo;s a,</p>
<p>I think the ethoses are different.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s interesting, yeah.</p>
<p>We had Drown Proofing.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s that?</p>
<p>In order to graduate from Georgia Tech,</p>
<p>this is a true thing.</p>
<p>Feel free to look it up.</p>
<p>If you.</p>
<p>A lot of schools have this by the way.</p>
<p>No, actually Georgia Tech was barely the first.</p>
<p>Brandeis has it.</p>
<p>Had it.</p>
<p>I feel like Georgia Tech was the first</p>
<p>in a lot of things.</p>
<p>It was the first in a lot of things.</p>
<p>Had the first master&rsquo;s degree.</p>
<p>First Bumblebee mascot.</p>
<p>Stop that.</p>
<p>First master&rsquo;s in computer science actually.</p>
<p>Right, online master&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Well that too, but way back in the 60s.</p>
<p>NSF grant.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re the first information</p>
<p>and computer science master&rsquo;s degree in the country.</p>
<p>But the Georgia Tech,</p>
<p>it used to be the case</p>
<p>that in order to graduate from Georgia Tech,</p>
<p>you had to take a Drown Proofing class.</p>
<p>Where effectively, they threw you in the water</p>
<p>and tied you up.</p>
<p>If you didn&rsquo;t drown, you got to graduate.</p>
<p>Tied you up?</p>
<p>I believe so.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>There were certainly versions of it,</p>
<p>but I mean luckily they ended it</p>
<p>just before I had to graduate</p>
<p>because otherwise I would have never graduated.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t going to happen.</p>
<p>I want to say 84, 83,</p>
<p>somewhere around then they ended it.</p>
<p>But yeah, you used to have to prove</p>
<p>you could tread water for some ridiculous amount of time</p>
<p>or you couldn&rsquo;t graduate.</p>
<p>Two minutes.</p>
<p>No, it was more than two minutes.</p>
<p>I bet it was two minutes.</p>
<p>Okay, well we&rsquo;ll look at it.</p>
<p>And it was in a bathtub.</p>
<p>Yeah, right.</p>
<p>You could just stare.</p>
<p>It was in a pool.</p>
<p>But it was a real thing.</p>
<p>But that idea that, you know, push you.</p>
<p>Fully clothed.</p>
<p>Yeah, fully clothed.</p>
<p>I bet it was that and not tied up.</p>
<p>Because who needs to learn how to swim when you&rsquo;re tied?</p>
<p>Nobody.</p>
<p>But who needs to learn to swim</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re actually falling into the water dressed?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a real thing.</p>
<p>I think your facts are getting in the way</p>
<p>with a good story.</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s fair.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fair.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t mean to.</p>
<p>All right, so they tie you up.</p>
<p>Sometimes the narrative matters.</p>
<p>But whatever it was, you had to,</p>
<p>it was called drown proofing for a reason.</p>
<p>The point of the story, Michael, is that it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>well, no, but that&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t bring it back to struggle.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a part of what Georgia Tech has always been.</p>
<p>And we struggle with that, by the way,</p>
<p>about what we want to be, particularly as things go.</p>
<p>But you sort of,</p>
<p>how much can you be pushed without breaking?</p>
<p>And you come out of the other end stronger, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a saying we used to have</p>
<p>when I was an undergrad there.</p>
<p>It was just Georgia Tech,</p>
<p>building tomorrow the night before.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>And it was just kind of idea that,</p>
<p>give me something impossible to do</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll do it in a couple of days</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s what I just spent</p>
<p>the last four or five or six years with.</p>
<p>That ethos definitely stuck to you.</p>
<p>Having now done a number of projects with you,</p>
<p>you definitely will do it the night before.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not entirely true.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with waiting until the last minute.</p>
<p>The secret is knowing when the last minute is.</p>
<p>Right, that&rsquo;s brilliantly put.</p>
<p>Yeah, that is a definite Charles statement</p>
<p>that I am trying not to embrace.</p>
<p>And I appreciate that</p>
<p>because you helped move my last minute up.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the social construct</p>
<p>the way you converge together</p>
<p>what the definition of last minute is.</p>
<p>We figure that all out together.</p>
<p>In fact, MIT, I&rsquo;m sure a lot of universities have this,</p>
<p>but MIT has like MIT time</p>
<p>that everyone has always agreed together</p>
<p>that there is such a concept</p>
<p>and everyone just keeps showing up like 10 to 15 to 20,</p>
<p>depending on the department, late to everything.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s like a weird drift that happens.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of fascinating.</p>
<p>Yeah, we&rsquo;re five minutes.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re five minutes.</p>
<p>In fact, the classes will say,</p>
<p>well, this is no longer true actually,</p>
<p>but it used to be a class that started at eight,</p>
<p>but actually it started at eight oh five,</p>
<p>it ends at nine, actually it ends at eight fifty five.</p>
<p>Everything&rsquo;s five minutes off</p>
<p>and nobody expects anything to start until five minutes</p>
<p>after the half hour, whatever it is.</p>
<p>It still exists.</p>
<p>It hurts my head.</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s rewind the clock back to the fifties and sixties</p>
<p>when you guys met, how did you,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just kidding, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>But what, can you tell the story of how you met?</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve, like the internet and the world</p>
<p>kind of knows you as connected in some ways</p>
<p>in terms of education of teaching the world.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like the public facing thing,</p>
<p>but how did you as human beings</p>
<p>and as collaborators meet?</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s two stories.</p>
<p>One is how we met and the other is how we</p>
<p>got to know each other.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not gonna say fell in love.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna say that we came to understand that we</p>
<p>Had some common something.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s funny.</p>
<p>Cause on the surface, I think we&rsquo;re different</p>
<p>in a lot of ways, but there&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, now we complete each other&rsquo;s</p>
<p>There you go.</p>
<p>Afternoon.</p>
<p>So I will tell the story of how we met</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll let Michael tell the story of how we met.</p>
<p>Okay, all right.</p>
<p>Okay, so here&rsquo;s how we met.</p>
<p>I was already at that point, it was AT&amp;T labs.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a long, interesting story there.</p>
<p>But anyway, I was there and Michael was coming to interview.</p>
<p>He was a professor at Duke at the time,</p>
<p>but decided for reasons that he wanted to be in New Jersey.</p>
<p>And so that would mean Bell Labs slash AT&amp;T labs.</p>
<p>And we were doing the interview.</p>
<p>Interviews are very much like academic interviews.</p>
<p>And so I had to be there.</p>
<p>We all had to meet with him afterwards</p>
<p>and so on, one on one.</p>
<p>But it was obvious to me that he was going to be hired.</p>
<p>Like no matter what, because everyone loved him.</p>
<p>They were just talking about all the great stuff he did.</p>
<p>Oh, he did this great thing.</p>
<p>And you had just won something at AAAI, I think.</p>
<p>Or maybe you got 18 papers in AAAI that year.</p>
<p>I got the best paper award at AAAI</p>
<p>for the crossword stuff.</p>
<p>Right, exactly.</p>
<p>So that had all happened and everyone was going on</p>
<p>and on and on about it.</p>
<p>Actually, so Tinder was saying incredibly nice things</p>
<p>about you.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>He can be very grumpy.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s nice to hear.</p>
<p>He was grumpily saying very nice things.</p>
<p>Oh, that makes sense.</p>
<p>And that does make sense.</p>
<p>So, you know, it was going to come.</p>
<p>So why was I meeting him?</p>
<p>I had something else I had to do.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t remember what it was.</p>
<p>It probably involved comedy.</p>
<p>So he remembers meeting me</p>
<p>as inconveniencing his afternoon.</p>
<p>So he came.</p>
<p>So I eventually came to my office.</p>
<p>I was in the middle of trying to do something.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t remember what.</p>
<p>And he came and he sat down.</p>
<p>And for reasons that are purely accidental,</p>
<p>despite what Michael thinks,</p>
<p>my desk at the time was set up</p>
<p>in such a way that it had sort of an L shape.</p>
<p>And the chair on the outside was always lower</p>
<p>than the chair that I was in.</p>
<p>And, you know, the kind of point was to&hellip;</p>
<p>The only reason I think that it was on purpose</p>
<p>is because you told me it was on purpose.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t remember that.</p>
<p>Anyway, the thing is, is that, you know, it kind of gives&hellip;</p>
<p>His guest chair was really low</p>
<p>so that he could look down at everybody.</p>
<p>The idea was just to simply create a nice environment</p>
<p>that you were asking for a mortgage</p>
<p>and I was going to say no.</p>
<p>That was the point.</p>
<p>It was a very simple idea here.</p>
<p>Anyway, so we sat there</p>
<p>and we just talked for a little while.</p>
<p>And I think he got the impression that I didn&rsquo;t like him.</p>
<p>Which wasn&rsquo;t true.</p>
<p>I strongly got that impression.</p>
<p>The talk was really good.</p>
<p>The talk, by the way, was terrible.</p>
<p>And right after the talk,</p>
<p>I said to my host, Michael Kearns,</p>
<p>who ultimately was my boss.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a huge fan.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a friend and a huge fan of Michael, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, he is a remarkable person.</p>
<p>After my talk, I went into the&hellip;</p>
<p>He went into basketball.</p>
<p>I went&hellip;</p>
<p>Racquetball, he&rsquo;s good at everything.</p>
<p>No, basketball.</p>
<p>No, but basketball and racquetball too.</p>
<p>Squash.</p>
<p>Squash, squash, squash, not racquetball.</p>
<p>Yes, squash, which is not&hellip;</p>
<p>Racquetball, yes.</p>
<p>Squash, no.</p>
<p>And I hope you hear that, Michael.</p>
<p>Oh, Michael Kearns.</p>
<p>As a game, not his skill level,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m pretty sure he&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>All right, there&rsquo;s some competitiveness there,</p>
<p>but the point is that it was like the middle of the day,</p>
<p>I had full day of interviews.</p>
<p>I got met with people,</p>
<p>but then in the middle of the day, I gave a job talk.</p>
<p>And then there was gonna be more interviews,</p>
<p>but I pulled Michael aside and I said,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s in both of our best interest</p>
<p>if I just leave now, because that was so bad</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;d just be embarrassing</p>
<p>if I have to talk to any more people.</p>
<p>You look bad for having invited me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, let&rsquo;s just forget this ever happened.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t think the talk went well.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one of the most Michael Lipman set of sentences</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;ve ever heard.</p>
<p>He did great, or at least everyone knew he was great,</p>
<p>so maybe it didn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>I was there, I remember the talk,</p>
<p>and I remember him being very much the way</p>
<p>I remember him now, on any given week.</p>
<p>So it was good.</p>
<p>And we met and we talked about stuff.</p>
<p>He thinks I didn&rsquo;t like him, but&hellip;</p>
<p>Because he was so grumpy.</p>
<p>Must&rsquo;ve been the chair thing.</p>
<p>The chair thing and the low voice, I think.</p>
<p>But like, he obviously&hellip;</p>
<p>And that slight skeptical look.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I have no idea what you&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>Well, I probably didn&rsquo;t have any idea</p>
<p>what you were talking about.</p>
<p>Anyway, I liked him.</p>
<p>He asked me questions, I answered questions.</p>
<p>I felt bad about myself.</p>
<p>It was a normal day.</p>
<p>And then he left.</p>
<p>And then he left, and that&rsquo;s how you met.</p>
<p>Can we take a&hellip;</p>
<p>And then I got hired and I was in the group.</p>
<p>Can we take a slight tangent on this topic of,</p>
<p>it sounds like, maybe you could speak</p>
<p>to the bigger picture.</p>
<p>It sounds like you&rsquo;re quite self critical.</p>
<p>Who, Charles?</p>
<p>No, you.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>I can do better.</p>
<p>Try me again.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll do better.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be so self critical.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Yeah, that was like a three out of 10 response.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s try to work it up to five and six.</p>
<p>Yeah, I remember Marvin Minsky said on a video interview,</p>
<p>something that the key to success in academic research</p>
<p>is to hate everything you do.</p>
<p>For some reason&hellip;</p>
<p>I think I followed that because I hate everything he&rsquo;s done.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good line.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a six out of 10.</p>
<p>Maybe that&rsquo;s a keeper.</p>
<p>But do you find that resonates with you at all</p>
<p>in how you think about talks and so on?</p>
<p>I would say it differently.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that.</p>
<p>No, not really.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s such an MIT view of the world though.</p>
<p>So I remember talking about this when, as a student,</p>
<p>you were basically told I will clean it up</p>
<p>for the purpose of the podcast.</p>
<p>My work is crap.</p>
<p>Then you go to a conference or something.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like, everybody else&rsquo;s work is crap.</p>
<p>Everybody else&rsquo;s work is crap.</p>
<p>And you feel better and better about it, relatively speaking.</p>
<p>And then you sort of keep working on it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t hate my work.</p>
<p>That resonates with me.</p>
<p>Yes, I&rsquo;ve never hated my work,</p>
<p>but I have been dissatisfied with it.</p>
<p>And I think being dissatisfied,</p>
<p>being okay with the fact that you&rsquo;ve taken a positive step,</p>
<p>the derivative&rsquo;s positive,</p>
<p>maybe even the second derivative&rsquo;s positive,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s important because that&rsquo;s a part of the hope, right?</p>
<p>But you have to, but I haven&rsquo;t gotten there yet.</p>
<p>If that&rsquo;s not there, that I haven&rsquo;t gotten there yet,</p>
<p>then it&rsquo;s hard to move forward, I think.</p>
<p>So I buy that, which is a little different</p>
<p>from hating everything that you do.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, there&rsquo;s things that I&rsquo;ve done</p>
<p>that I like better than I like myself.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s separating me from the work, essentially.</p>
<p>So I think I am very critical of myself,</p>
<p>but sometimes the work I&rsquo;m really excited about.</p>
<p>And sometimes I think it&rsquo;s kind of good.</p>
<p>Does that happen right away?</p>
<p>So I found the work that I&rsquo;ve liked, that I&rsquo;ve done,</p>
<p>most of it, I liked it in retrospect</p>
<p>more when I was far away from it in time.</p>
<p>I have to be fairly excited about it to get done.</p>
<p>No, excited at the time, but then happy with the result.</p>
<p>But years later, or even I might go back,</p>
<p>you know what, that actually turned out to matter.</p>
<p>That turned out to matter.</p>
<p>Or, oh gosh, it turns out I&rsquo;ve been thinking about that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually influenced all the work that I&rsquo;ve done since</p>
<p>without realizing it.</p>
<p>Boy, that guy was smart.</p>
<p>Yeah, that guy had a future.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think there&rsquo;s something to it.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s something to the idea</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got to hate what you do, but it&rsquo;s not quite hate.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just being unsatisfied.</p>
<p>And different people motivate themselves differently.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t happen to motivate myself with self loathing.</p>
<p>I happen to motivate myself with something else.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re able to sit back and be proud of,</p>
<p>in retrospect, of the work you&rsquo;ve done.</p>
<p>Well, and it&rsquo;s easier when you can connect it</p>
<p>with other people, because then you can be proud of them.</p>
<p>Proud of the people, yeah.</p>
<p>And then the question is.</p>
<p>You can still safely hate yourself.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s win, win, Michael.</p>
<p>Or at least win, lose, which is what you&rsquo;re looking for.</p>
<p>Oh, wow, there&rsquo;s so many brilliant minds in this.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s levels.</p>
<p>So how did you actually meet me?</p>
<p>Yeah, Michael.</p>
<p>So the way I think about it is,</p>
<p>because we didn&rsquo;t do much research together at AT&amp;T,</p>
<p>but then we all got laid off.</p>
<p>So that sucked.</p>
<p>By the way, sorry to interrupt,</p>
<p>but that was one of the most magical places</p>
<p>historically speaking.</p>
<p>They did not appreciate what they had.</p>
<p>And how do we,</p>
<p>I feel like there&rsquo;s a profound lesson in there too.</p>
<p>How do we get it, like what was, why was it so magical?</p>
<p>Is it just a coincidence of history?</p>
<p>Or is there something special about?</p>
<p>There were some really good managers</p>
<p>and people who really believed in machine learning</p>
<p>as this is gonna be important.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s get the people who are thinking about this</p>
<p>in creative and insightful ways</p>
<p>and put them in one place and stir.</p>
<p>Yeah, but even beyond that, right?</p>
<p>It was Bell Labs at its heyday.</p>
<p>And even when we were there, which I think was past its heyday.</p>
<p>And to be clear, he&rsquo;s gotten to be at Bell Labs.</p>
<p>I never got to be at Bell Labs.</p>
<p>I joined after that.</p>
<p>Yeah, I showed up in 91 as a grad student.</p>
<p>So I was there for a long time, every summer, except for two.</p>
<p>So twice I worked for companies</p>
<p>that had just stopped being Bell Labs.</p>
<p>Bellcore and then AT&amp;T Labs.</p>
<p>So Bell Labs was several locations or for the research</p>
<p>or is it one?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if Jersey&rsquo;s involved somehow.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all in Jersey.</p>
<p>Yeah, they&rsquo;re all over the place.</p>
<p>But they were in a couple of places in Jersey.</p>
<p>Murray Hill was the Bell Labs place.</p>
<p>So you had an office in Murray Hill</p>
<p>at one point in your career.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I played Ultimate Frisbee</p>
<p>on the cricket pitch at Bell Labs at Murray Hill.</p>
<p>And then it became AT&amp;T Labs when it split off</p>
<p>with loose during what we called Trivestiture.</p>
<p>Are you better than Michael Korn&rsquo;s at Ultimate Frisbee?</p>
<p>Yeah. Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>But I think that one&rsquo;s not boasting.</p>
<p>I think Charles plays a lot of Ultimate</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t think Michael does.</p>
<p>Yes, but that wasn&rsquo;t the point.</p>
<p>The point is yes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m finally better.</p>
<p>Sorry.</p>
<p>Okay, I have played on a championship winning</p>
<p>Ultimate Frisbee team or whatever,</p>
<p>Ultimate team with Charles.</p>
<p>So I know how good he is.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s really good.</p>
<p>How good I was anyway, when I was younger.</p>
<p>But the thing is.</p>
<p>I know how young he was when he was younger.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>So much younger than now.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s older now.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m older.</p>
<p>Michael was a much better basketball player than I was.</p>
<p>Michael Kearns.</p>
<p>Yes, no, not Michael.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s be very clear about that.</p>
<p>To be clear, I&rsquo;ve not played basketball with you.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t know how terrible I am,</p>
<p>but you have a probably pretty good guess.</p>
<p>And that you&rsquo;re not as good as Michael Kearns.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s tall and athletic.</p>
<p>And he cared about it.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s very athletic.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s very good.</p>
<p>And probably competitive.</p>
<p>I love hanging out with Michael.</p>
<p>Anyway, but we were talking about something else,</p>
<p>although I no longer remember what it was.</p>
<p>What were we talking about?</p>
<p>Oh, Bell Labs.</p>
<p>But also Labs.</p>
<p>So this was kind of cool about what was magical about it.</p>
<p>The first thing you have to know</p>
<p>is that Bell Labs was an arm of the government, right?</p>
<p>Because AT&amp;T was an arm of the government.</p>
<p>It was a monopoly.</p>
<p>And every month you paid a little thing on your phone bill,</p>
<p>which turned out was a tax</p>
<p>for all the research that Bell Labs was doing.</p>
<p>And they invented transistors and the laser</p>
<p>and whatever else is that they did.</p>
<p>The Big Bang or whatever, the cosmic background radiation.</p>
<p>Yeah, they did all that stuff.</p>
<p>They had some amazing stuff with directional microphones,</p>
<p>by the way.</p>
<p>I got to go in this room</p>
<p>where they had all these panels and everything.</p>
<p>And we would talk and one another,</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;d move some panels around.</p>
<p>And then he would have me step two steps to the left.</p>
<p>And I couldn&rsquo;t hear a thing he was saying</p>
<p>because nothing was bouncing off the walls.</p>
<p>And then he would shut it all down</p>
<p>and you could hear your heartbeat,</p>
<p>which is deeply disturbing to hear your heartbeat.</p>
<p>You can feel it.</p>
<p>I mean, you can feel it now.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just so much all this sort of noise around.</p>
<p>Anyway, Bell Labs was about pure research.</p>
<p>It was a university, in some sense,</p>
<p>the purest sense of a university, but without students.</p>
<p>So it was all the faculty working with one another</p>
<p>and students would come in to learn.</p>
<p>They would come in for three or four months</p>
<p>during the summer and they would go away.</p>
<p>But it was just this kind of wonderful experience.</p>
<p>I could walk out my door.</p>
<p>In fact, I would often have to walk out my door</p>
<p>and deal with Rich Sutton and Michael Kearns</p>
<p>yelling at each other about whatever it is</p>
<p>they were yelling about the proper way</p>
<p>to prove something or another.</p>
<p>And I could just do that.</p>
<p>And Dave McAllister and Peter Stone</p>
<p>and all of these other people,</p>
<p>including, it&rsquo;s a tender and then eventually Michael.</p>
<p>And it was just a place where you could think thoughts.</p>
<p>And it was okay because so long as once every 25 years or so</p>
<p>somebody invented a transistor, it paid for everything else.</p>
<p>You could afford to take the risk.</p>
<p>And then when that all went away,</p>
<p>it became harder and harder and harder to justify it</p>
<p>as far as the folks who were very far away were concerned.</p>
<p>And there was such a fast turnaround</p>
<p>among mental management on the AT&amp;T side</p>
<p>that you never had a chance to really build a relationship.</p>
<p>At least people like us didn&rsquo;t have a chance</p>
<p>to build a relationship.</p>
<p>So when the diaspora happened, it was amazing, right?</p>
<p>Everybody left and I think everybody ended up</p>
<p>at a great place and made a huge,</p>
<p>continued to do really good work with machine learning.</p>
<p>But it was a wonderful place.</p>
<p>And people will ask me, what&rsquo;s the best job you&rsquo;ve ever had?</p>
<p>And as a professor, anyway, the answer that I would give is</p>
<p>well, probably Bell Labs in some very real sense.</p>
<p>And I will never have a job like that again</p>
<p>because Bell Labs doesn&rsquo;t exist anymore.</p>
<p>And Microsoft research is great and Google does good stuff.</p>
<p>And you can pick IBM, you can tell if you want to,</p>
<p>but Bell Labs was magical.</p>
<p>It was around for, it was an important time</p>
<p>and it represents a high watermark</p>
<p>in basic research in the US.</p>
<p>Is there something you could say about the physical proximity</p>
<p>and the chance collisions?</p>
<p>Like we live in this time of the pandemic</p>
<p>where everyone is maybe trying to see the silver lining</p>
<p>and accepting the remote nature of things.</p>
<p>Is there one of the things that people like faculty</p>
<p>that I talk to miss is the procrastination.</p>
<p>Like the chance to make everything is about meetings</p>
<p>that are supposed to be,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s not a chance to just talk about comic book</p>
<p>or whatever, like go into discussion that&rsquo;s totally pointless.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s funny you say this</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s how we met, met, it was exactly that.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll let Michael say that, but I&rsquo;ll just add one thing</p>
<p>which is just that research is a social process</p>
<p>and it helps to have random social interactions</p>
<p>even if they don&rsquo;t feel social at the time,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s how you get things done.</p>
<p>One of the great things about the AI Lab when I was there,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t quite know what it looks like now</p>
<p>once they moved buildings,</p>
<p>but we had entire walls that were whiteboards</p>
<p>and people would just get up there</p>
<p>and they were just right and people would walk up</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;d have arguments</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;d explain things to one another</p>
<p>and you got so much out of the freedom to do that.</p>
<p>You had to be okay with people challenging</p>
<p>every fricking word you said,</p>
<p>which I would sometimes find deeply irritating,</p>
<p>but most of the time it was quite useful.</p>
<p>But the sort of pointlessness and the interaction</p>
<p>was in some sense the point, at least for me.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think offline yesterday I mentioned</p>
<p>Josh Tenenbaum and he&rsquo;s very much, he&rsquo;s a man,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s such an inspiration in the childlike way</p>
<p>that he pulls you in on any topic.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t even have to be about machine learning</p>
<p>or the brain, he&rsquo;ll just pull you in</p>
<p>to a closest writable surface,</p>
<p>which is still, you can find whiteboards</p>
<p>at MIT everywhere, and just like basically cancel</p>
<p>all meetings and talk for a couple hours</p>
<p>about some aimless thing and it feels like</p>
<p>the whole world, the time space continuum kind of warps</p>
<p>and that becomes the most important thing.</p>
<p>And then it&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s definitely something</p>
<p>worth missing in this world where everything&rsquo;s remote.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some magic to the physical presence.</p>
<p>Whenever I wonder myself whether MIT really is</p>
<p>as great as I remember it, I just go talk to Josh.</p>
<p>Yeah, you know, that&rsquo;s funny.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a few people in this world that carry</p>
<p>the best of what particular institutions stand for, right?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s Josh.</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t, my guess is he&rsquo;s unaware of this.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the point.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That the masters are not aware of their mastery.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>How did we meet?</p>
<p>Yes, but first a tangent, no.</p>
<p>How did you meet me?</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not sure what you were thinking,</p>
<p>but when it started to dawn on me</p>
<p>that maybe we had a longer term bond</p>
<p>was after we all got laid off.</p>
<p>And you had decided at that point</p>
<p>that we were still paid.</p>
<p>We were given an opportunity to like do a job search</p>
<p>and kind of make a transition,</p>
<p>but it was clear that we were done.</p>
<p>And I would go to my office to work</p>
<p>and you would go to my office to keep me from working.</p>
<p>That was my recollection of it.</p>
<p>You had decided that there was no,</p>
<p>really no point in working for the company</p>
<p>because our relationship with the company was done.</p>
<p>Yeah, but remember I felt that way beforehand.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t about the company.</p>
<p>It was about the set of people there</p>
<p>doing really cool things.</p>
<p>And it always, always been that way.</p>
<p>But we were working on something together.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>So at the very end, we all got laid off,</p>
<p>but then our boss came to, our boss&rsquo;s boss came to us</p>
<p>because our boss was Michael Kearns</p>
<p>and he had jumped ship brilliantly, like perfect timing.</p>
<p>Like things like right before the ship was about to sink,</p>
<p>he was like, gotta go and landed perfectly</p>
<p>Because Michael Kearns.</p>
<p>And leaving the rest of us to go like, this is fine.</p>
<p>And then it was clear that it wasn&rsquo;t fine</p>
<p>and we were all toast.</p>
<p>So we had this sort of long period of time.</p>
<p>But then our boss figured out, okay, wait,</p>
<p>maybe we can save a couple of these people</p>
<p>if we can have them do something really useful.</p>
<p>And the useful thing was we were gonna make</p>
<p>basically an automated assistant</p>
<p>that could help you with your calendar.</p>
<p>You could like tell it things</p>
<p>and it would respond appropriately.</p>
<p>It would just kind of integrate across</p>
<p>all sorts of your personal information.</p>
<p>And so me and Charles and Peter Stone</p>
<p>were set up as the crack team</p>
<p>to actually solve this problem.</p>
<p>Other people maybe were too theoretical that they thought,</p>
<p>but we could actually get something done.</p>
<p>So we sat down to get something done</p>
<p>and there wasn&rsquo;t time and it wouldn&rsquo;t have saved us anyway.</p>
<p>And so it all kind of went downhill.</p>
<p>But the interesting, I think, coda to that</p>
<p>is that our boss&rsquo;s boss is a guy named Ron Brockman.</p>
<p>And when he left AT&amp;T,</p>
<p>cause we were all laid off,</p>
<p>he went to DARPA, started up a program there</p>
<p>that became KALO,</p>
<p>which is the program from which Siri sprung,</p>
<p>which is a digital assistant</p>
<p>that helps you with your calendar</p>
<p>and a bunch of other things.</p>
<p>It really, in some ways got its start</p>
<p>with me and Charles and Peter trying to implement this vision</p>
<p>that Ron Brockman had,</p>
<p>that he ultimately got implemented</p>
<p>through his role at DARPA.</p>
<p>So when I&rsquo;m trying to feel less bad</p>
<p>about having been laid off</p>
<p>from what is possibly the greatest job of all time,</p>
<p>I think about, well, we kind of helped birth Siri.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s something.</p>
<p>And then he did other things too.</p>
<p>But we got to spend a lot of time in his office</p>
<p>and talk about lots of things.</p>
<p>We got to spend a lot of time in my office, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>And so then we went on our merry way.</p>
<p>Everyone went to different places.</p>
<p>Charles landed at Georgia Tech,</p>
<p>which was what he always dreamed he would do.</p>
<p>And so that worked out well.</p>
<p>I came up with a saying at the time,</p>
<p>which is luck favors the Charles.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of like luck favors the prepared,</p>
<p>but Charles, like he wished something</p>
<p>and then it would basically happen just the way he wanted.</p>
<p>It was inspirational to see things go that way.</p>
<p>Things worked out.</p>
<p>And we stayed in touch.</p>
<p>And then I think it really helped</p>
<p>when you were working on,</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;d kept me in the loop for things like threads</p>
<p>and the work that you were doing at Georgia Tech.</p>
<p>But then when they were starting</p>
<p>their online master&rsquo;s program,</p>
<p>he knew that I was really excited about MOOCs</p>
<p>and online teaching.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, I have a plan.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, tell me your plan.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, I can&rsquo;t tell you the plan yet.</p>
<p>Cause they were deep in negotiations</p>
<p>between Georgia Tech and Udacity to make this happen.</p>
<p>And they didn&rsquo;t want it to leak.</p>
<p>So Charles would kept teasing me about it,</p>
<p>but wouldn&rsquo;t tell me what was actually going on.</p>
<p>And eventually it was announced and he said,</p>
<p>I would like you to teach the machine learning course</p>
<p>with me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, that can&rsquo;t possibly work.</p>
<p>But it was a great idea.</p>
<p>And it was super fun.</p>
<p>It was a lot of work to put together,</p>
<p>but it was really great.</p>
<p>Was that the first time you thought about,</p>
<p>first of all, was it the first time</p>
<p>you got seriously into teaching?</p>
<p>I mean, I was a professor.</p>
<p>This was already after you jumped to,</p>
<p>so like there&rsquo;s a little bit of jumping around in time.</p>
<p>Yeah, sorry about that.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a pretty big jump in time.</p>
<p>So like the MOOCs thing.</p>
<p>So Charles got to Georgia Tech and he,</p>
<p>I mean, maybe Charles, maybe this is a Charles story.</p>
<p>I got to Georgia Tech in 2002.</p>
<p>He got to Georgia Tech in 2002.</p>
<p>And worked on things like revamping the curriculum,</p>
<p>the undergraduate curriculum,</p>
<p>so that it had some kind of semblance of modular structure</p>
<p>because computer science was at the time</p>
<p>moving from a fairly narrow specific set of topics</p>
<p>to touching a lot of other parts of intellectual life.</p>
<p>And the curriculum was supposed to reflect that.</p>
<p>And so Charles played a big role in kind of redesigning that.</p>
<p>And then the.</p>
<p>And for my labors, I ended up as associate dean.</p>
<p>Right, he got to become associate dean</p>
<p>of charge of educational stuff.</p>
<p>Yeah, I was under.</p>
<p>This should be a valuable lesson.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re good at something,</p>
<p>they will give you responsibility to do more of that thing.</p>
<p>Well.</p>
<p>Until you.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t show competence.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t show competence if you.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t want responsibility.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what they say.</p>
<p>The reward for good work is more work.</p>
<p>The reward for bad work is less work.</p>
<p>Which, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Depending on what you&rsquo;re trying to do that week,</p>
<p>one of those is better than the other.</p>
<p>Well, one of the problems with the word work,</p>
<p>sorry to interrupt, is that it seems to be an antonym</p>
<p>in this particular language.</p>
<p>We have the opposite of happiness.</p>
<p>But it seems like they&rsquo;re.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one of, you know, we talked about balance.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always like work life balance.</p>
<p>It always rubbed me the wrong way as a terminology.</p>
<p>I know it&rsquo;s just words.</p>
<p>Right, the opposite of work is play.</p>
<p>But ideally, work is play.</p>
<p>Oh, I can&rsquo;t tell you how much time I&rsquo;d spend.</p>
<p>Certainly, when I was at Bell Labs,</p>
<p>except for a few very key moments,</p>
<p>as a professor, I would do this too.</p>
<p>I would just say, I cannot believe</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re paying me to do this.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s fun.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s something that I would do for a hobby</p>
<p>if I could anyway.</p>
<p>So that sort of worked out.</p>
<p>Are you sure you want to be saying that</p>
<p>when this is being recorded?</p>
<p>As a dean, that is not true at all.</p>
<p>I need a raise.</p>
<p>But I think here with this,</p>
<p>even though a lot of time passed,</p>
<p>Mike and I talked almost every, well, we texted,</p>
<p>almost every day during the period.</p>
<p>Charles, at one point, took me,</p>
<p>the ICML conference, the machine learning conference</p>
<p>was in Atlanta.</p>
<p>I was the chair, the general chair of the conference.</p>
<p>Charles was my publicity chair or something like that,</p>
<p>or fundraising chair.</p>
<p>Yeah, but he decided it&rsquo;d be really funny</p>
<p>if he didn&rsquo;t actually show up for the conference</p>
<p>in his own home city.</p>
<p>So he didn&rsquo;t, but he did at one point</p>
<p>pick me up at the conference in his Tesla</p>
<p>and drove me to the Atlanta mall</p>
<p>and forced me to buy an iPhone</p>
<p>because he didn&rsquo;t like how it was to text with me</p>
<p>and thought it would be better for him</p>
<p>if I had an iPhone, the text would be somehow smoother.</p>
<p>And it was.</p>
<p>And it is, and his life is better.</p>
<p>And my life is better.</p>
<p>And so, yeah, but it was, yeah,</p>
<p>Charles forced me to get an iPhone</p>
<p>so that he could text me more efficiently.</p>
<p>I thought that was an interesting moment.</p>
<p>It works for me.</p>
<p>Anyway, so we kept talking the whole time</p>
<p>and then eventually we did the teaching thing</p>
<p>and it was great.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a couple of reasons for that, by the way.</p>
<p>One is I really wanted to do something different.</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;ve got this medium here,</p>
<p>people claim it can change things.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s a thing that you could do in this medium</p>
<p>that you could not do otherwise besides edit, right?</p>
<p>I mean, what could you do?</p>
<p>And being able to do something with another person</p>
<p>was that kind of thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very hard.</p>
<p>I mean, you can take turns,</p>
<p>but teaching together, having conversations is very hard.</p>
<p>So that was a cool thing.</p>
<p>The second thing, give me an excuse</p>
<p>to do more stuff with him.</p>
<p>Yeah, I always thought, he makes it sound brilliant.</p>
<p>And it is, I guess.</p>
<p>But at the time it really felt like</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got a lot to do, Charles is saying,</p>
<p>and it would be great if Michael could teach the course</p>
<p>and I could just hang out.</p>
<p>Yeah, just kind of coast on that.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s what the second class was more like that.</p>
<p>Because the second class was explicitly like that.</p>
<p>But the first class, it was at least half.</p>
<p>Yeah, but I do all the stuff.</p>
<p>So the structure that we came up with.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re once again letting the facts</p>
<p>get in the way of a good story.</p>
<p>I should just let Charles talk to us.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s the facts that he saw.</p>
<p>So that was kind of true for 7642.</p>
<p>Yeah, that was sort of true for 7642,</p>
<p>which is the reinforcement learning class,</p>
<p>because that was really his class.</p>
<p>You started with reinforcement learning or machine learning?</p>
<p>Intro machine learning, 7641,</p>
<p>which is supervised learning, unsupervised learning,</p>
<p>and reinforcement learning and decision making,</p>
<p>cram all that in there,</p>
<p>the kind of assignments that we talked about earlier.</p>
<p>And then eventually, about a year later,</p>
<p>we did a follow on 7642,</p>
<p>which is reinforcement learning and decision making.</p>
<p>The first class was based on something</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d been teaching at that point for well over a decade.</p>
<p>And the second class was based on something</p>
<p>Michael had been teaching.</p>
<p>Actually, I learned quite a bit</p>
<p>teaching that class with him, but he drove most of that.</p>
<p>But the first one I drove most, it was all my material.</p>
<p>Although I had stolen that material originally</p>
<p>from slides I found online from Michael,</p>
<p>who had originally stolen that material</p>
<p>from, I guess, slides he found online,</p>
<p>probably from Andrew Moore,</p>
<p>because the jokes were the same anyway.</p>
<p>At least some of the, at least when I found the slides,</p>
<p>some of the stuff with it.</p>
<p>Is that true?</p>
<p>Yes, every machine learning class taught in the early 2000s</p>
<p>stole from Andrew Moore.</p>
<p>A particular joke or two?</p>
<p>At least the structure.</p>
<p>Now, I did, and he did, actually,</p>
<p>a lot more with reinforcement learning and such,</p>
<p>and game theory and those kinds of things.</p>
<p>But, you know, we all sort of built in.</p>
<p>You mean in the research world?</p>
<p>No, no, no, in that class.</p>
<p>No, I mean in teaching that class.</p>
<p>The coverage was different than what we started.</p>
<p>Most people were just doing supervised learning</p>
<p>and maybe a little bit of clustering and whatnot,</p>
<p>but we took it all the way to machine learning.</p>
<p>A lot of it just comes from Tom Mitchell&rsquo;s book.</p>
<p>Oh, no, yeah, except, well,</p>
<p>half of it comes from Tom Mitchell&rsquo;s book, right?</p>
<p>I mean, the other half doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>This is why it&rsquo;s all readings, right?</p>
<p>Because certain things weren&rsquo;t invented</p>
<p>when Tom wrote that stuff.</p>
<p>Yeah, okay, that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>All right, but it was quite good.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a reason for that besides, you know,</p>
<p>just, I wanted to do it.</p>
<p>I wanted to do something new,</p>
<p>and I wanted to do something with him,</p>
<p>which is a realization,</p>
<p>which is despite what you might believe,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s an introvert and I&rsquo;m an introvert,</p>
<p>or I&rsquo;m on the edge of being an introvert anyway.</p>
<p>But both of us, I think, enjoy the energy of the crowd,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something about talking to people</p>
<p>and bringing them into whatever we find interesting</p>
<p>that is empowering, energizing, or whatever.</p>
<p>And I found the idea of staring alone at a computer screen</p>
<p>and then talking off of materials</p>
<p>less inspiring than I wanted it to be.</p>
<p>And I had in fact done a MOOC for Udacity on algorithms.</p>
<p>And it was a week in a dark room talking at the screen,</p>
<p>writing on the little pad.</p>
<p>And I didn&rsquo;t know this was happening,</p>
<p>but they had watched,</p>
<p>the crew had watched some of the videos</p>
<p>while, you know, like in the middle of this,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re like, something&rsquo;s wrong.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re sort of shutting down.</p>
<p>And I think a lot of it was I&rsquo;ll make jokes</p>
<p>and no one would laugh.</p>
<p>And I felt like the crowd hated me.</p>
<p>Now, of course, there was no crowd.</p>
<p>So like, it wasn&rsquo;t rational.</p>
<p>But each time I tried it and I got no reaction,</p>
<p>it just was taking the energy out of my performance,</p>
<p>out of my presentation.</p>
<p>Such a fantastic metaphor for grad school.</p>
<p>Anyway, by working together,</p>
<p>we could play off each other and have a good time.</p>
<p>And keep the energy up,</p>
<p>because you can&rsquo;t let your guard down for a moment</p>
<p>with Charles, he&rsquo;ll just overpower you.</p>
<p>I have no idea what you&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>But we would work really well together, I thought,</p>
<p>and we knew each other,</p>
<p>so I knew that we could sort of make it work.</p>
<p>Plus, I was the associate dean,</p>
<p>so they had to do what I told them to do.</p>
<p>We had to make it work.</p>
<p>And so it worked out very well, I thought,</p>
<p>well enough that we.</p>
<p>With great power comes great power.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>And we became smooth and curly.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s when we did the overfitting thriller video.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s a thing.</p>
<p>So can we just, like, smooth and curly,</p>
<p>where did that come from?</p>
<p>Okay, so it happened.</p>
<p>It was completely spontaneous.</p>
<p>These are nicknames you go by.</p>
<p>Yeah, so it&rsquo;s what the students call us.</p>
<p>He was lecturing.</p>
<p>So the way that we structured the lectures</p>
<p>is one of us is the lecturer</p>
<p>and one of us is basically the student.</p>
<p>And so he was lecturing on.</p>
<p>The lecturer prepares all the materials,</p>
<p>comes up with the quizzes,</p>
<p>and then the student comes in not knowing anything.</p>
<p>So it was just like being on campus.</p>
<p>And I was doing game theory in particular,</p>
<p>the Prisoner&rsquo;s Dilemma.</p>
<p>Prisoner&rsquo;s Dilemma.</p>
<p>And so he needed to set up a little Prisoner&rsquo;s Dilemma grid.</p>
<p>So he drew it and I could see what he was drawing.</p>
<p>And the Prisoner&rsquo;s Dilemma consists of two players,</p>
<p>two parties.</p>
<p>So he decided he would make little cartoons</p>
<p>of the two of us.</p>
<p>And so there was two criminals, right,</p>
<p>that were deciding whether or not to rat each other out.</p>
<p>One of them he drew as a circle with a smiley face</p>
<p>and a kind of goatee thing, smooth head.</p>
<p>And the other one with all sorts of curly hair.</p>
<p>And he said, this is smooth and curly.</p>
<p>I said, smooth and curly?</p>
<p>He said, no, no, smooth with a V.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very important that it have a V.</p>
<p>And then the students really took to that.</p>
<p>Like they found that relatable.</p>
<p>He started singing Smooth Criminal by Michael Jackson.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>And those names stuck.</p>
<p>So we now have a video series,</p>
<p>an episode, our kind of first actual episode</p>
<p>should be coming out today,</p>
<p>Smooth and Curly on video,</p>
<p>where the two of us discuss episodes of Westworld.</p>
<p>We watch Westworld and we&rsquo;re like, huh,</p>
<p>what does this say about computer science and AI?</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve never, we did not watch it.</p>
<p>I mean, no, it&rsquo;s on season three or whatever we have.</p>
<p>As of this recording, it&rsquo;s on season three.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve watched now two episodes total.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think I watched three.</p>
<p>What do you think about Westworld?</p>
<p>Two episodes in.</p>
<p>So I can tell you so far,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just guessing what&rsquo;s gonna happen next.</p>
<p>It seems like bad things are gonna happen</p>
<p>with the robots uprising.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a lot of.</p>
<p>Spoiler alert.</p>
<p>So I have not, I have not,</p>
<p>I mean, you know, I vaguely remember a movie existing.</p>
<p>So I assume it&rsquo;s related to that, but.</p>
<p>That was more my time than your time, Charles.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right, cause you&rsquo;re much older than I am.</p>
<p>I think the important thing here is that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s narrative, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all about telling a story.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the whole driving thing.</p>
<p>But the idea that they would give these reveries,</p>
<p>that they would make people,</p>
<p>they would make them.</p>
<p>Let them remember.</p>
<p>Remember the awful things that happened.</p>
<p>The terrible things that happened.</p>
<p>Who could possibly think that was gonna,</p>
<p>I gotta, I mean, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve only seen the first two episodes</p>
<p>or maybe the third one.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;ve only seen the first one.</p>
<p>You know what it was?</p>
<p>You know what the problem is?</p>
<p>That the robots were actually designed by Hannibal Lecter.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>They weren&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>So like, what do you think is gonna happen?</p>
<p>Bad things.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s clear that things are happening</p>
<p>and characters are being introduced</p>
<p>and we don&rsquo;t yet know anything,</p>
<p>but still I was just struck by how</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all driven by narrative and story.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s all these implied things like programming,</p>
<p>the programming interface is talking to them</p>
<p>about what&rsquo;s going on in their heads,</p>
<p>which is both, I mean, artistically,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s probably useful to film it that way.</p>
<p>But think about how it would work in real life.</p>
<p>That just seems very great.</p>
<p>But there was, we saw in the second episode,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a screen.</p>
<p>You could see things.</p>
<p>They were wearing like Kubrick&rsquo;s glasses.</p>
<p>In the world.</p>
<p>It was quite interesting to just kind of ask this question</p>
<p>so far.</p>
<p>I mean, I assume it veers off into Never Never Land</p>
<p>at some point.</p>
<p>So we don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t answer that question.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also a fan of a guy named Alex Garland.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a director of Ex Machina.</p>
<p>Mm hmm.</p>
<p>And he is the first,</p>
<p>I wonder if Kubrick was like this actually,</p>
<p>is he like studies,</p>
<p>what would it take to program an AI systems?</p>
<p>Like he&rsquo;s curious enough to go into that direction.</p>
<p>On the Westworld side,</p>
<p>I felt there was more emphasis on the narratives</p>
<p>than like actually asking like computer science questions.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Like, how would you build this?</p>
<p>How would you, and.</p>
<p>How would you debug it?</p>
<p>I still think, to me, that&rsquo;s the key issue.</p>
<p>They were terrible debuggers.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, they said specifically,</p>
<p>so we make a change and we put it out in the world</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s bad because something terrible could happen.</p>
<p>Like if you&rsquo;re putting things out in the world</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re not sure whether something terrible</p>
<p>is going to happen, your process is probably.</p>
<p>I just feel like there should have been someone</p>
<p>whose sole job it was to walk around and poke his head in</p>
<p>and say, what could possibly go wrong?</p>
<p>Just over and over again.</p>
<p>I would have loved if there was an,</p>
<p>and I did watch a lot more and I&rsquo;m not giving anything away.</p>
<p>I would have loved it if there was like an episode</p>
<p>where like the new intern is like debugging</p>
<p>a new model or something and like it just keeps failing</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re like, all right.</p>
<p>And then it&rsquo;s more turns into like a episode</p>
<p>of Silicon Valley or something like that.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Versus like this ominous AI systems</p>
<p>that are constantly like threatening the fabric</p>
<p>of this world that&rsquo;s been created.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, and you know the other,</p>
<p>this reminds me of something that,</p>
<p>so I agree that that should be very cool,</p>
<p>at least for the small percentage of people</p>
<p>who care about debugging systems.</p>
<p>But the other thing is.</p>
<p>Right, debugging, the series.</p>
<p>Yeah, it falls into, think of the sequels,</p>
<p>fear of the debugger.</p>
<p>Oh my gosh.</p>
<p>Anyway, so.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a nightmare show, it&rsquo;s a horror movie.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s where we lose people, by the way,</p>
<p>early on is the people who either decide,</p>
<p>either figure out debugging or think debugging is terrible.</p>
<p>This is where we lose people in computer science.</p>
<p>This is a part of the struggle versus suffering, right?</p>
<p>You get through it and you kind of get the skills of it,</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re just like, this is dumb,</p>
<p>and this is a dumb way to do anything.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s when we lose people.</p>
<p>But, well, I&rsquo;ll leave it at that.</p>
<p>But I think that there&rsquo;s something really, really neat</p>
<p>about framing it that way.</p>
<p>But what I don&rsquo;t like about all of these things,</p>
<p>and I love Tex Machina, by the way,</p>
<p>although the ending was very depressing.</p>
<p>One of the things I have to talk to Alex about,</p>
<p>he says that the thing that nobody noticed he put in</p>
<p>is at the end, spoiler alert,</p>
<p>the robot turns and looks at the camera and smiles, briefly.</p>
<p>And to him, he thought that his definition</p>
<p>of passing the general version of the Turing test,</p>
<p>or the consciousness test, is smiling for no one.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the Chinese room kind of experiment.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not always trying to act for others,</p>
<p>but just on your own, being able to have a relationship</p>
<p>with the actual experience and just take it in.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, he said nobody noticed the magic of it.</p>
<p>I have this vague feeling that I remember the smile,</p>
<p>but now you&rsquo;ve just put the memory in my head,</p>
<p>so probably not.</p>
<p>But I do think that that&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>Although, by looking at the camera,</p>
<p>you are smiling for the audience, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re breaking the fourth wall.</p>
<p>It seems, I mean, well, that&rsquo;s a limitation of the medium.</p>
<p>But I like that idea.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s the problem I have with all of those movies,</p>
<p>all of them, is that, but I know why it&rsquo;s this way,</p>
<p>and I enjoy those movies, and Westworld,</p>
<p>is it sets up the problem of AI as succeeding</p>
<p>and then having something we cannot control.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not the bad part of AI.</p>
<p>The bad part of AI is the stuff</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re living through now, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s using the data to make decisions that are terrible.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the intelligence that&rsquo;s gonna go out there</p>
<p>and surpass us and take over the world</p>
<p>or lock us into a room to starve to death slowly</p>
<p>over multiple days.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s instead the tools that we&rsquo;re building</p>
<p>that are allowing us to make the terrible decisions</p>
<p>we would have less efficiently made before, right?</p>
<p>Computers are very good at making us more efficient,</p>
<p>including being more efficient at doing terrible things.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the part of the AI we have to worry about.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the true intelligence that we&rsquo;re gonna build</p>
<p>sometime in the future, probably long after we&rsquo;re around.</p>
<p>But I think that whole framing of it</p>
<p>sort of misses the point, even though it is inspiring.</p>
<p>And I was inspired by those ideas, right?</p>
<p>I got into this in part</p>
<p>because I wanted to build something like that.</p>
<p>Philosophical questions are interesting to me,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s not where the terror comes from.</p>
<p>The terror comes from the everyday.</p>
<p>And you can construct situations</p>
<p>in the subtlety of the interaction between AI and the human,</p>
<p>like with social networks,</p>
<p>all the stuff you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>with interactive artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>But I feel like Cal 9000 came a little bit closer to that</p>
<p>in 2001 Space Odyssey,</p>
<p>because it felt like a personal assistant.</p>
<p>It felt like closer to the AI systems we have today.</p>
<p>And the real things we might actually encounter,</p>
<p>which is over relying in some fundamental way</p>
<p>on our dumb assistants or on social networks,</p>
<p>like over offloading too much of us</p>
<p>onto things that require internet and power and so on</p>
<p>and thereby becoming powerless as a standalone entity.</p>
<p>And then when that thing starts to misbehave</p>
<p>in some subtle way, it creates a lot of problems.</p>
<p>And those problems are dramatized when you&rsquo;re in space,</p>
<p>because you don&rsquo;t have a way to walk away.</p>
<p>Well, as the man said,</p>
<p>once we started making the decisions for you,</p>
<p>it stopped being your world, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the matrix, Michael, in case you don&rsquo;t remember.</p>
<p>But on the other hand, I could say no,</p>
<p>because isn&rsquo;t that what we do with people anyway?</p>
<p>You know, just kind of the shared intelligence</p>
<p>that is humanity is relying on other people constantly.</p>
<p>I mean, we hyper specialize, right?</p>
<p>As individuals, we&rsquo;re still generally intelligent.</p>
<p>We make our own decisions in a lot of ways,</p>
<p>but we leave most of this up to other people.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s perfectly fine.</p>
<p>And by the way, everyone doesn&rsquo;t necessarily share our goals.</p>
<p>Sometimes they seem to be quite against us.</p>
<p>Sometimes we make decisions that others would see</p>
<p>as against our own interests.</p>
<p>And yet we somehow manage it, manage to survive.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not entirely sure why an AI</p>
<p>would actually make that worse or even different, really.</p>
<p>You mentioned the matrix.</p>
<p>Do you think we&rsquo;re living in a simulation?</p>
<p>It does feel like a thought game</p>
<p>more than a real scientific question.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;ll tell you why I think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an interesting thought experiment.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see what you think.</p>
<p>From a computer science perspective,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a good experiment of how difficult would it be</p>
<p>to create a sufficiently realistic world</p>
<p>that us humans would enjoy being in.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s almost like a competition.</p>
<p>If we&rsquo;re living in a simulation,</p>
<p>then I don&rsquo;t believe that we were put in the simulation.</p>
<p>I believe that it&rsquo;s just physics playing out</p>
<p>and we came out of that.</p>
<p>Like, I don&rsquo;t think.</p>
<p>So you think you have to build the universe</p>
<p>and have all the fun in the world?</p>
<p>I think that the universe itself,</p>
<p>we can think of that as a simulation.</p>
<p>And in fact, sometimes I try to think about,</p>
<p>to understand what it&rsquo;s like for a computer</p>
<p>to start to think about the world.</p>
<p>I try to think about the world.</p>
<p>Things like quantum mechanics,</p>
<p>where it doesn&rsquo;t feel very natural to me at all.</p>
<p>And it really strikes me as,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t understand this thing that we&rsquo;re living in.</p>
<p>It has, there&rsquo;s weird things happening in it</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t feel natural to me at all.</p>
<p>Now, if you want to call that as the result of a simulator,</p>
<p>okay, I&rsquo;m fine with that.</p>
<p>But like, I don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the bugs in the simulation.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the bugs.</p>
<p>I mean, the interesting thing about the simulation</p>
<p>is that it might have bugs.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s the thing that I,</p>
<p>But there would be bugs for the people in the simulation.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just reality.</p>
<p>Unless you were aware enough to know that there was a bug.</p>
<p>But I think.</p>
<p>Back to the matrix.</p>
<p>Yeah, the way you put the question though.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that we live in a simulation created for us.</p>
<p>Okay, I would say that.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve actually never thought about it that way.</p>
<p>I mean, the way you asked the question though,</p>
<p>could you create a world that is enough for us humans?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an interestingly sort of self referential question</p>
<p>because the beings that created the simulation</p>
<p>probably have not created the simulation</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s realistic for them.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;re in the simulation and so it&rsquo;s realistic for us.</p>
<p>So we could create a simulation</p>
<p>that is fine for the people in the simulation, as it were.</p>
<p>That would not necessarily be fine for us</p>
<p>as the creators of the simulation.</p>
<p>But, well, you can forget.</p>
<p>I mean, if you play video games in virtual reality,</p>
<p>you can, if some suspension of disbelief or whatever.</p>
<p>It becomes a world.</p>
<p>Even like in brief moments,</p>
<p>you forget that another world exists.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s what like good stories do.</p>
<p>They pull you in.</p>
<p>And the question is, is it possible to pull,</p>
<p>our brains are limited.</p>
<p>Is it possible to pull the brain in</p>
<p>to where we actually stay in that world</p>
<p>longer and longer and longer and longer?</p>
<p>And like, not only that, but we don&rsquo;t wanna leave.</p>
<p>And so, especially this is the key thing</p>
<p>about the developing brain,</p>
<p>is if we journey into that world early on in life, often.</p>
<p>How would you even know, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, so I, but like from a video game design perspective,</p>
<p>from a Westworld perspective,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s, I think it&rsquo;s an important thing</p>
<p>for even computer scientists to think about</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s clear that video games are getting much better.</p>
<p>And virtual reality,</p>
<p>although it&rsquo;s been ups and downs</p>
<p>just like artificial intelligence,</p>
<p>it feels like virtual reality will be here</p>
<p>in a very impressive form</p>
<p>if we were to fast forward 100 years into the future</p>
<p>in a way that might change society fundamentally.</p>
<p>Like if I were to,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very limited in predicting the future as all of us are,</p>
<p>but if I were to try to predict,</p>
<p>like in which way I&rsquo;d be surprised</p>
<p>to see the world 100 years from now,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;d be that, or impressed,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;d be that we&rsquo;re all no longer living</p>
<p>in this physical world,</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re all living in a virtual world.</p>
<p>You really need to read Calculating God by Sawyer.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a, he&rsquo;ll read it in the night.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very easy read,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s, assuming you&rsquo;re that kind of reader,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a good story.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s kind of about this,</p>
<p>but not in a way that it appears.</p>
<p>And I really enjoyed the thought experiment.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s pretty sure it&rsquo;s Robert Sawyer.</p>
<p>But anyway, he&rsquo;s apparently</p>
<p>Canadian&rsquo;s top science fiction writer,</p>
<p>which is why the story mostly takes place in Toronto.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s a very good sort of story</p>
<p>that sort of imagines this.</p>
<p>Very different kind of simulation hypothesis sort of thing</p>
<p>from say, The Egg, for example.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;m talking about the short story.</p>
<p>By the guy who did The Martian.</p>
<p>Who wrote The Martian?</p>
<p>You know what I&rsquo;m talking about.</p>
<p>The Martian. Matt Damon.</p>
<p>The book.</p>
<p>So we had this whole discussion</p>
<p>that Michael doesn&rsquo;t partake in this exercise of reading.</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t seem to like it,</p>
<p>which seems very strange to me,</p>
<p>considering how much he has to read.</p>
<p>I read all the time.</p>
<p>I used to read 10 books every week</p>
<p>when I was in sixth grade or whatever.</p>
<p>I was, a lot of it&rsquo;s science fiction,</p>
<p>a lot of it&rsquo;s history, but I love to read.</p>
<p>But anyway, you should read Calculating God.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;ll, it&rsquo;s very easy to read, like I said,</p>
<p>and I think you&rsquo;ll enjoy sort of the ideas that it presents.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think the thought experiment is quite interesting.</p>
<p>One thing I&rsquo;ve noticed about people growing up now,</p>
<p>I mean, we talk about social media,</p>
<p>but video games is a much bigger,</p>
<p>bigger and bigger and bigger part of their lives.</p>
<p>And the video games have become much more realistic.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s possible that the three of us are not,</p>
<p>maybe the two of you are not familiar exactly</p>
<p>with the numbers we&rsquo;re talking about here.</p>
<p>The number of people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s bigger than movies, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s huge.</p>
<p>I used to do a lot of the computational narrative stuff.</p>
<p>I understand that economists can actually see</p>
<p>the impact of video games on the labor market.</p>
<p>That there&rsquo;s fewer young men of a certain age</p>
<p>participating in like paying jobs than you&rsquo;d expect.</p>
<p>And that they trace it back to video games.</p>
<p>I mean, the problem with Star Trek</p>
<p>was not warp drive or teleportation.</p>
<p>It was the holodeck.</p>
<p>Like if you have the holodeck, that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it, you go in the holodeck, you never come out.</p>
<p>I mean, it just never made, once I saw that,</p>
<p>I thought, okay, well, so this is the end of humanity</p>
<p>as we know it, right?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve invented the holodeck.</p>
<p>Because that feels like the singularity,</p>
<p>not some AGI or whatever.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s some possibility to go into another world</p>
<p>that can be artificially made better than this one.</p>
<p>And slowing it down so you live forever.</p>
<p>Or speeding it up so you appear to live forever.</p>
<p>Or making the decision of when to die.</p>
<p>And then most of us will just be old people on the porch</p>
<p>yelling at the kids these days in their virtual reality.</p>
<p>But they won&rsquo;t hear us because they&rsquo;ve got headphones on.</p>
<p>So, I mean, rewinding back to Mook&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>is there lessons that you&rsquo;ve, speaking to kids these days?</p>
<p>That was a transition.</p>
<p>That was fantastic.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll fix it in post.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s Charles&rsquo;s favorite phrase.</p>
<p>Fix it in post?</p>
<p>Fix it in post.</p>
<p>When we were recording all the time,</p>
<p>whenever the editor didn&rsquo;t like something or whatever,</p>
<p>I would say, we&rsquo;ll fix it in post.</p>
<p>He hated that.</p>
<p>He hated that more than anything.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s Charles&rsquo;s way of saying,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not gonna do it again.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re on your own for this one.</p>
<p>But it always got fixed in post.</p>
<p>Exactly right.</p>
<p>So is there something you&rsquo;ve learned about,</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s interesting to talk about Mook&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Is there something you&rsquo;ve learned</p>
<p>about the process of education,</p>
<p>about thinking about the present?</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s two lines of conversation to be had here.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the future of education in general</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve learned about.</p>
<p>And more passionately is the education</p>
<p>in the times of COVID.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>The second thing in some ways matters more than the first,</p>
<p>for at least in my head,</p>
<p>not just because it&rsquo;s happening now,</p>
<p>but because I think it&rsquo;s reminded us of a lot of things.</p>
<p>Coincidentally, today, there&rsquo;s an article out</p>
<p>by a good friend of mine,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s also a professor at Georgia Tech,</p>
<p>but more importantly, a writer and editor</p>
<p>at the Atlantic, a guy named Ian Bogost.</p>
<p>And the title is something like,</p>
<p>Americans Will Sacrifice Anything</p>
<p>for the College Experience.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s about why we went back to college</p>
<p>and why people wanted us to go back to college.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not greedy presidents</p>
<p>trying to get the last dollar from someone.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because they want to go to college.</p>
<p>And what they&rsquo;re paying for is not the classes.</p>
<p>What they&rsquo;re paying for is the college experience.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the education that&rsquo;s being there.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve believed this for a long time,</p>
<p>that we continually make this mistake of,</p>
<p>people want to go back to college</p>
<p>as being people want to go back to class.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>They want to go back to campus.</p>
<p>They want to move away from home.</p>
<p>They want to do all those things that people experience.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a rite of passage.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an identity, if I can steal some of Ian&rsquo;s words here.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>And I think what we&rsquo;ve learned through COVID</p>
<p>is it has made it,</p>
<p>the disaggregation was not the disaggregation</p>
<p>of the education from the place, the university place,</p>
<p>and that you can get the best anywhere you want to.</p>
<p>Turns out there&rsquo;s lots of reasons</p>
<p>why that is not necessarily true.</p>
<p>The disaggregation is having it shoved in our faces</p>
<p>that the reason to go, again,</p>
<p>that the reason to go to college</p>
<p>is not necessarily to learn.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s to have the college experience.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s very difficult for us to accept,</p>
<p>even though we behave that way,</p>
<p>most of us, when we were undergrads.</p>
<p>A lot of us didn&rsquo;t go to every single class.</p>
<p>We learned and we got it and we look back on it</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re happy we had the learning experience as well,</p>
<p>obviously, particularly us,</p>
<p>because this is the kind of thing that we do.</p>
<p>And my guess is that&rsquo;s true</p>
<p>of the vast majority of your audience.</p>
<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t mean the,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m standing in front of you telling you this,</p>
<p>is the thing that people are excited about.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why they want to be there,</p>
<p>primarily why they want to be there.</p>
<p>So to me, that&rsquo;s what COVID has forced us to deal with,</p>
<p>even though I think we&rsquo;re still all in deep denial about it</p>
<p>and hoping that it&rsquo;ll go back to that.</p>
<p>And I think about 85% of it will.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll be able to pretend</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s really the way it is, again,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll forget the lessons of this.</p>
<p>But technically what&rsquo;ll come out of it,</p>
<p>or technologically what&rsquo;ll come out of it</p>
<p>is a way of providing a more dispersed experience</p>
<p>through online education</p>
<p>and these kinds of remote things that we&rsquo;ve learned.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll have to come up with new ways to engage them</p>
<p>in the experience of college,</p>
<p>which includes not just the parties</p>
<p>or the whatever kids do,</p>
<p>but the learning part of it</p>
<p>so that they actually come out four or five</p>
<p>or six years later with having actually learned something.</p>
<p>So I think the world</p>
<p>will be radically different afterwards.</p>
<p>And I think technology will matter for that,</p>
<p>just not in the way that the people</p>
<p>who were building the technology originally</p>
<p>imagined it would be.</p>
<p>And I think this would have been true even without COVID,</p>
<p>but COVID has accelerated that reality.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s happening in two or three years or five years,</p>
<p>as opposed to 10 or 15.</p>
<p>That was an amazing answer that I did not understand.</p>
<p>It was passionate and meaningful.</p>
<p>Shots fired.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t, no, I just didn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>no, I&rsquo;m not trying to criticize it.</p>
<p>I just think, I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m getting it.</p>
<p>So you mentioned disaggregation.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s that?</p>
<p>Well, so the power of technology</p>
<p>that if you go on the West Coast and hang out long enough</p>
<p>is all about we&rsquo;re gonna disaggregate these things together.</p>
<p>The books from the bookstore, that kind of a thing.</p>
<p>And then suddenly Amazon controls the universe, right?</p>
<p>And technology is a disruptor, right?</p>
<p>And people have been predicting that</p>
<p>for higher education for a long time,</p>
<p>but certainly in the age of moves.</p>
<p>So is this the sort of idea like</p>
<p>students can aggregate on a campus someplace</p>
<p>and then take classes over the network anywhere?</p>
<p>Yeah, this is what people thought was gonna happen,</p>
<p>or at least people claimed it was gonna happen, right?</p>
<p>Because my daughter is essentially doing that now.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s on one campus, but learning in a different campus.</p>
<p>Sure, and COVID makes that possible, right?</p>
<p>COVID makes that legal, all but avoidable, right?</p>
<p>But the idea originally was that,</p>
<p>you and I were gonna create this machine learning class</p>
<p>and it was gonna be great,</p>
<p>and then no one else would,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;d be the machine learning class everyone takes, right?</p>
<p>That was never gonna happen, but something like that,</p>
<p>you can see happening. But I feel like</p>
<p>you didn&rsquo;t address that.</p>
<p>Why, why, why is it that, why, why?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that will be the thing that happens.</p>
<p>So the college experience,</p>
<p>maybe I missed what the college experience was.</p>
<p>I thought it was peers, like people hanging around.</p>
<p>A large part of it is peers.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s peers and independence.</p>
<p>Yeah, but none of that,</p>
<p>you can do classes online for all of that.</p>
<p>No, no, no, no, because we&rsquo;re social people, right?</p>
<p>So you wanna be in the same room.</p>
<p>So when we take the classes,</p>
<p>that also has to be part of an experience.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s in a context, and the context is the university.</p>
<p>And by the way, it actually matters</p>
<p>that Georgia Tech really is different from Brown.</p>
<p>I see, because then students can choose</p>
<p>the kind of experience they think</p>
<p>is gonna be best for them.</p>
<p>Okay, I think we&rsquo;re giving too much agency to the students</p>
<p>in making an informed decision.</p>
<p>Okay. But the truth,</p>
<p>but yes, they will make choices</p>
<p>and they will have different experiences.</p>
<p>And some of those choices will be made for them.</p>
<p>Some of them will be choices they&rsquo;re making</p>
<p>because they think it&rsquo;s this, that, or the other.</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t want to say,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to give the idea.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not homogenous.</p>
<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s certainly not homogenous, right?</p>
<p>I mean, Georgia Tech is different from Brown.</p>
<p>Brown is different from pick your favorite state school</p>
<p>in Iowa, Iowa State, okay?</p>
<p>Which I guess is my favorite state school in Iowa.</p>
<p>But these are all different.</p>
<p>They have different contexts.</p>
<p>And a lot of those contexts are,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re about history, yes,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re also about the location of where you are.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re about the larger group of people who are around you,</p>
<p>whether you&rsquo;re in Athens, Georgia,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re basically the only thing that&rsquo;s there</p>
<p>as a university, you&rsquo;re responsible for all the jobs,</p>
<p>or whether you&rsquo;re at Georgia State University,</p>
<p>which is an urban campus,</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re surrounded by six million people</p>
<p>in your campus where it ends and begins in the city,</p>
<p>ends and begins, we don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>It actually matters whether you&rsquo;re a small campus</p>
<p>or a large campus.</p>
<p>I mean, these things matter.</p>
<p>Why is it that if you go to Georgia Tech,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re forever proud of that,</p>
<p>and you say that to people at dinners,</p>
<p>like bars and whatever,</p>
<p>and if you get a degree at an online university somewhere,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not a thing that comes up at a bar.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s funny you say that.</p>
<p>So the students who take our online masters</p>
<p>by several measures are more loyal</p>
<p>than the students who come on campus,</p>
<p>certainly for the master&rsquo;s degree.</p>
<p>The reason for that, I think,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;d have to ask them,</p>
<p>but based on my conversations with them,</p>
<p>I feel comfortable saying this,</p>
<p>is because this didn&rsquo;t exist before.</p>
<p>I mean, we talk about this online masters</p>
<p>and that it&rsquo;s reaching 11,000 students,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s an amazing thing,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re admitting everyone we believe who can succeed.</p>
<p>We got a 60% acceptance rate.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s amazing, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also a $6,600 degree.</p>
<p>The entire degree costs $6,600 or $7,000,</p>
<p>depending on how long you take.</p>
<p>A dollar degree, as opposed to $46,000</p>
<p>it would cost you to come on campus.</p>
<p>So that feels, and I can do it while I&rsquo;m working full time,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve got a family and a mortgage</p>
<p>and all these other things.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s an opportunity to do something you wanted to do,</p>
<p>but you didn&rsquo;t think was possible</p>
<p>without giving up two years of your life,</p>
<p>as well as all the money</p>
<p>and everything else in the life that you had built.</p>
<p>So I think we created something that&rsquo;s had an impact,</p>
<p>but importantly, we gave a set of people opportunities</p>
<p>they otherwise didn&rsquo;t feel they had.</p>
<p>So I think people feel very loyal about that.</p>
<p>And my biggest piece of evidence for that,</p>
<p>besides the surveys,</p>
<p>is that we have somewhere north of 80 students,</p>
<p>might be 100 at this point,</p>
<p>who graduated, but come back in TA for this class,</p>
<p>for basically minimum wage,</p>
<p>even though they&rsquo;re working full time,</p>
<p>because they believe in sort of having that opportunity</p>
<p>and they wanna be a part of something.</p>
<p>Now, will generation three feel this way?</p>
<p>15 years from now, will people have that same sense?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, but right now they kind of do.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s not the online,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a matter of feeling as if you&rsquo;re a part of something.</p>
<p>Right, we&rsquo;re all very tribal, right?</p>
<p>And I think there&rsquo;s something very tribal</p>
<p>about being a part of something like that.</p>
<p>Being on campus makes that easier,</p>
<p>going through a shared experience makes that easier.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s harder to have that shared experience</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re alone looking at a computer screen.</p>
<p>We can create ways to make that true.</p>
<p>But is it possible?</p>
<p>It is possible.</p>
<p>The question is, it still is the intuition to me,</p>
<p>and it was at the beginning when I saw something</p>
<p>like the online master&rsquo;s program,</p>
<p>is that this is gonna replace universities.</p>
<p>No, it won&rsquo;t replace universities.</p>
<p>But like why?</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s living</p>
<p>in a different part of the ecosystem, right?</p>
<p>The people who are taking it are already adults,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve gone through their undergrad experience.</p>
<p>I think their goals have shifted from when they were 17.</p>
<p>They have other things that are going on.</p>
<p>But it does do something really important,</p>
<p>something very social and very important, right?</p>
<p>You know this whole thing about,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t build the sidewalks, just leave the grass</p>
<p>and the students or the people will walk</p>
<p>and you put the sidewalks where they create paths,</p>
<p>this kind of thing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s interesting, yeah.</p>
<p>Their architects apparently believe</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the right way to do things.</p>
<p>The metaphor here is that we created this environment,</p>
<p>we didn&rsquo;t quite know how to think about the social aspect,</p>
<p>but we didn&rsquo;t have time to solve all,</p>
<p>do all the social engineering, right?</p>
<p>The students did it themselves,</p>
<p>they created these groups, like on Google Plus,</p>
<p>there were like 30 something groups created</p>
<p>in the first year because somebody had used Google Plus.</p>
<p>And they created these groups</p>
<p>and they divided up in ways that made sense.</p>
<p>We live in the same state or we&rsquo;re working</p>
<p>on the same things or we have the same background</p>
<p>or whatever and they created these social things.</p>
<p>We sent them T shirts and they wear,</p>
<p>we have all these great pictures of students</p>
<p>putting on their T shirts as they travel around the world.</p>
<p>I climbed this mountain top, I&rsquo;m putting this T shirt on,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a part of this, they were a part of them.</p>
<p>They created the social environment</p>
<p>on top of the social network and the social media</p>
<p>that existed to create this sense of belonging</p>
<p>and being a part of something.</p>
<p>They found a way to do it, right?</p>
<p>And I think they had other,</p>
<p>it scratched an itch that they had,</p>
<p>but they had scratched some of that itch</p>
<p>that might&rsquo;ve required they&rsquo;d be physically</p>
<p>in the same place long before, right?</p>
<p>So I think, yes, it&rsquo;s possible</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s more than possible, it&rsquo;s necessary.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s going to replace the university</p>
<p>as we know it.</p>
<p>The university as we know it will change.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s just a lot of power</p>
<p>in the kind of rite of passage</p>
<p>kind of going off to yourself.</p>
<p>Now, maybe there&rsquo;ll be some other rite of passage</p>
<p>that&rsquo;ll happen.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;ll drive us somewhere else, it&rsquo;s possible.</p>
<p>So the university is such a fascinating mess of things.</p>
<p>So just even the faculty position is a fascinating mess.</p>
<p>Like it doesn&rsquo;t make any sense.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s stabilized itself,</p>
<p>but like why are the world class researchers</p>
<p>spending a huge amount of time or their time teaching</p>
<p>and service?</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;re doing like three jobs.</p>
<p>And I mean, it turns out it&rsquo;s maybe an accident of history</p>
<p>or human evolution, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>It seems like the people who are really good at teaching</p>
<p>are often really good at research.</p>
<p>There seems to be a parallel there,</p>
<p>but like it doesn&rsquo;t make any sense</p>
<p>that you should be doing that.</p>
<p>At the same time, it also doesn&rsquo;t seem to make sense</p>
<p>that your place where you party</p>
<p>is the same place where you go to learn calculus</p>
<p>or whatever.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s a safe space.</p>
<p>Safe space for everything.</p>
<p>Yeah, relatively speaking, it&rsquo;s a safe space.</p>
<p>Now, by the way, I feel the need very strongly</p>
<p>to point out that we are living</p>
<p>in a very particular weird bubble, right?</p>
<p>Most people don&rsquo;t go to college.</p>
<p>And by the way, the ones who do go to college,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not 18 years old, right?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like 25 or something.</p>
<p>I forget the numbers.</p>
<p>The places where we&rsquo;ve been, where we are,</p>
<p>they look like whatever we think</p>
<p>the traditional movie version of universities are.</p>
<p>But for most people, it&rsquo;s not that way at all.</p>
<p>By the way, most people who drop out of college,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s entirely for financial reasons, right?</p>
<p>So we were talking about a particular experience.</p>
<p>And so for that set of people,</p>
<p>which is very small, but larger than it was a decade</p>
<p>or two or three or four, certainly, ago,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that will change.</p>
<p>My concern, which I think is kind of implicit</p>
<p>in some of these questions,</p>
<p>is that somehow we will divide the world up further</p>
<p>into the people who get to have this experience</p>
<p>and get to have the network</p>
<p>and they sort of benefit from it,</p>
<p>and everyone else, while increasingly requiring</p>
<p>that they have more and more credentials</p>
<p>in order to get a job as a barista, right?</p>
<p>You gotta have a master&rsquo;s degree</p>
<p>in order to work at Starbucks.</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;re gonna force people to do these things,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re not gonna get to have that experience,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;ll be a small group of people who do</p>
<p>who will continue to, you know, positive feedback,</p>
<p>look, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p>I worry a lot about that, which is why, for me,</p>
<p>and by the way, here&rsquo;s an answer</p>
<p>to your question about faculty,</p>
<p>which is why, to me, that you have to focus</p>
<p>on access and the mission.</p>
<p>I think the reason, whether it&rsquo;s good, bad, or strange,</p>
<p>I mean, I agree, it&rsquo;s strange,</p>
<p>but I think it&rsquo;s useful to have the faculty member,</p>
<p>particularly at large R1 universities</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;ve all had experiences,</p>
<p>that you tie what they get to do</p>
<p>and with the fundamental mission of the university</p>
<p>and let the mission drive.</p>
<p>What I hear when I talk to faculty is,</p>
<p>they love their PhD students</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re reproducing, basically, right?</p>
<p>And it lets them do their research and multiply.</p>
<p>But they understand that the mission is the undergrads,</p>
<p>and so they will do it without complaint, mostly,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a part of the mission and why they&rsquo;re here,</p>
<p>and they have experiences with it themselves,</p>
<p>and it was important to get them</p>
<p>where they were going.</p>
<p>The people who tend to get squeezed in that, by the way,</p>
<p>are the master&rsquo;s students, right,</p>
<p>who are neither the PhDs who are like us</p>
<p>nor the undergrads we have already bought into the idea</p>
<p>that we have to teach, though.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s increasingly changing.</p>
<p>Anyway, I think tying that mission in really matters,</p>
<p>and it gives you a way to unify people</p>
<p>around making it an actual higher calling.</p>
<p>Education feels like more of a higher calling to me</p>
<p>than even research,</p>
<p>because education, you cannot treat it as a hobby</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re going to do it well.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s the pushback on this whole system</p>
<p>is that education should be a full time job, right?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s almost like research is a distraction from that.</p>
<p>Yes, although I think most of our colleagues,</p>
<p>many of our colleagues would say that research is the job</p>
<p>and education is the distraction.</p>
<p>Right, but that&rsquo;s the beautiful dance.</p>
<p>It seems to be that tension in itself seems to work,</p>
<p>seems to bring out the best in the faculty.</p>
<p>But I will point out two things.</p>
<p>One thing I&rsquo;m going to point out,</p>
<p>and the other thing I want Michael to point out,</p>
<p>because I think Michael is much closer</p>
<p>to sort of the ideal professor in some sense than I am.</p>
<p>Well, he is a dean.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re the platonic sense of a professor.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what he meant by that,</p>
<p>but he is a dean, so he has a different experience.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m giving him time to think of the profound thing</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s going to say.</p>
<p>That was good.</p>
<p>But let me point this out,</p>
<p>which is that we have lecturers</p>
<p>in the College of Computing where I am.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s 10 or 12 of them, depending on how you count,</p>
<p>as opposed to the 90 or so tenure track faculty.</p>
<p>Those 10 lecturers who only teach,</p>
<p>well, they don&rsquo;t only teach, they also do service.</p>
<p>Some of them do research as well, but primarily they teach.</p>
<p>They teach 50%, over 50% of our credit hours,</p>
<p>and we teach everybody, right?</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re doing not just,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re doing more than eight times the work</p>
<p>of the tenure track faculty,</p>
<p>just more closer to nine or 10.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s including our grad courses, right?</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re doing this, they&rsquo;re teaching more,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re touching more than anyone,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re beloved for it.</p>
<p>I mean, so we recently had a survey.</p>
<p>Everyone does these alumni surveys.</p>
<p>You hire someone from the outside to do whatever,</p>
<p>and I was really struck by something.</p>
<p>You saw all these really cool numbers.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to talk about it</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s all internal, confidential stuff.</p>
<p>But one thing I will talk about</p>
<p>is there was a single question we asked our alum,</p>
<p>and these are people who graduated,</p>
<p>born in the 30s and 40s,</p>
<p>all the way up to people who graduated last week, right?</p>
<p>Well, last semester.</p>
<p>Okay, good.</p>
<p>Time flies.</p>
<p>Yeah, time flies.</p>
<p>And it was the question,</p>
<p>name a single person who had a strong positive impact on you,</p>
<p>something like that.</p>
<p>I think it was special impact?</p>
<p>Yeah, special impact on you.</p>
<p>And then, so they got all the answers from people,</p>
<p>and they created a word cloud.</p>
<p>It was clearly a word cloud created by people</p>
<p>who don&rsquo;t do word clouds for a living</p>
<p>because they had one person whose name appeared</p>
<p>like nine different times,</p>
<p>like Philip, Phil, Dr. Phil, you know, but whatever.</p>
<p>But they got all this.</p>
<p>And I looked at it, and I noticed something really cool.</p>
<p>The five people from the College of Computing,</p>
<p>I recognized, were in that cloud.</p>
<p>And four of them were lecturers,</p>
<p>the people who teach.</p>
<p>Two of them, relatively modern,</p>
<p>both were chairs of our division of computing instruction.</p>
<p>One just, one retired, one is going to retire soon.</p>
<p>And the other two were lecturers,</p>
<p>I remembered, from the 1980s.</p>
<p>Two of those four actually have.</p>
<p>By the way, the fifth person was Charles.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not important.</p>
<p>The thing is, I don&rsquo;t tell people that.</p>
<p>But the two of those people</p>
<p>our teaching awards are named after.</p>
<p>Thank you, Michael.</p>
<p>Two of those our teaching awards are named after, right?</p>
<p>So when you ask students, alumni,</p>
<p>people who are now 60, 70 years old even,</p>
<p>you know, who touched them?</p>
<p>They say the Dean of Students.</p>
<p>They say the big teachers who taught</p>
<p>the big introductory classes that got me into it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a guy named Richard Park who&rsquo;s on there,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s, you know, who&rsquo;s known as a great teacher.</p>
<p>The Phil Adler guy who,</p>
<p>I probably just said his last name wrong,</p>
<p>but I know the first name&rsquo;s Phil</p>
<p>because he kept showing up over and over again.</p>
<p>Famous.</p>
<p>Adler is what it said.</p>
<p>Okay, good.</p>
<p>But different people spelled it differently.</p>
<p>So he appeared multiple times.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So he was a, clearly,</p>
<p>he was a professor in the business school.</p>
<p>But when you read about him,</p>
<p>I went to read about him because I was curious who he was.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s all about his teaching</p>
<p>and the students that he touched, right?</p>
<p>So whatever it is that we&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>and we think we&rsquo;re doing that&rsquo;s important</p>
<p>or why we think the universities function,</p>
<p>the people who go through it,</p>
<p>they remember the people who were kind to them,</p>
<p>the people who taught them something,</p>
<p>and they do remember it.</p>
<p>They remember it later.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s important.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why the mission matters.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Not to completely lose track of the fundamental problem</p>
<p>of how do we replace the party aspect of universities</p>
<p>before we go to the what makes the platonic professor.</p>
<p>Do you think, like, what in your sense is the role of MOOCs</p>
<p>in this whole picture during COVID?</p>
<p>Like, should we desperately be clamoring</p>
<p>to get back on campus?</p>
<p>Or is this a stable place to be for a little while?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I know that the online teaching experience</p>
<p>and learning experience has been really rough.</p>
<p>I think that people find it to be a struggle</p>
<p>in a way that&rsquo;s not a happy, positive struggle,</p>
<p>that when you got through it,</p>
<p>you just feel like glad that it&rsquo;s over</p>
<p>as opposed to I&rsquo;ve achieved something.</p>
<p>So, you know, I worry about that.</p>
<p>But, you know, I worry about just even before this happened,</p>
<p>I worry about lecture teaching,</p>
<p>how well is that actually really working</p>
<p>as far as a way to do education,</p>
<p>as a way to inspire people.</p>
<p>I mean, all the data that I&rsquo;m aware of seems to indicate,</p>
<p>and this kind of fits, I think, with Charles&rsquo;s story,</p>
<p>is that people respond to connection, right?</p>
<p>They actually feel, if they feel connected</p>
<p>to the person teaching the class,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re more likely to go along with it.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re more able to retain information.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re more motivated to be involved</p>
<p>in the class in some way.</p>
<p>And that really matters.</p>
<p>People&hellip;</p>
<p>You mean to the human themselves.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay, can&rsquo;t you do that actually</p>
<p>perhaps more effectively online?</p>
<p>Like you mentioned, science communication.</p>
<p>So I literally, I think, learned linear algebra</p>
<p>from Gilbert Strang by watching MIT OpenCourseWare</p>
<p>when I was in track.</p>
<p>Like, and he was a personality,</p>
<p>he was a bit like a tiny&hellip;</p>
<p>In this tiny little world of math,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a bit of a rockstar, right?</p>
<p>So you kind of look up to that person.</p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t that replace the in person education?</p>
<p>It can help.</p>
<p>I will point out something, I can&rsquo;t share the numbers,</p>
<p>but we have surveyed our students,</p>
<p>and even though they have feelings</p>
<p>about what I would interpret as connection,</p>
<p>I like that word, in the different modes of classrooms,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no difference between how well</p>
<p>they think they&rsquo;re learning.</p>
<p>For them, the thing that makes them unhappy</p>
<p>is the situation they&rsquo;re in.</p>
<p>And I think the lack of connection,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not whether they&rsquo;re learning anything.</p>
<p>They seem to think they&rsquo;re learning something anyway, right?</p>
<p>In fact, they seem to think</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re learning it equally well,</p>
<p>presumably because the faculty are putting in,</p>
<p>or the instructors, more generally speaking,</p>
<p>are putting in the energy and effort</p>
<p>to try to make certain that what they&rsquo;ve curated</p>
<p>can be expressed to them in a useful way.</p>
<p>But the connection is missing.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s huge differences in what they prefer.</p>
<p>And as far as I can tell,</p>
<p>what they prefer is more connection, not less.</p>
<p>That connection just doesn&rsquo;t have to be physically</p>
<p>in a classroom.</p>
<p>I mean, look, I used to teach 348 students</p>
<p>in my machine learning class on campus.</p>
<p>Do you know why?</p>
<p>That was the biggest classroom on campus.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re sitting in theater seats.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m literally on a stage looking down on them</p>
<p>and talking to them, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no, I mean, we&rsquo;re not sitting down,</p>
<p>having a one on one conversation,</p>
<p>reading each other&rsquo;s body language,</p>
<p>trying to communicate and going,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not doing any of that.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re past the third row,</p>
<p>it might as well be online anyway</p>
<p>is the kind of thing that people have said.</p>
<p>Daphne has actually said some version of this</p>
<p>that online starts on the third row or something like that.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s not, yeah, I like it.</p>
<p>I think it captures something important.</p>
<p>But people still came, by the way.</p>
<p>Even the people who had access to our material</p>
<p>would still come to class.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s a certain element</p>
<p>about looking to the person next to you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like their presence there, their boredom.</p>
<p>And like when the parts are boring</p>
<p>and their excitement when the parts are exciting,</p>
<p>like in sharing in that,</p>
<p>like unspoken kind of, yeah, communication.</p>
<p>In part, the connection is with the other people</p>
<p>in the room.</p>
<p>Yeah, watching the circus on TV alone is not really.</p>
<p>Ever been to a movie theater</p>
<p>and been the only one there at a comedy?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not as funny as when you&rsquo;re in a room</p>
<p>full of people all laughing.</p>
<p>Well, you need, maybe you need just another person.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, as opposed to many.</p>
<p>Maybe there&rsquo;s some kind of.</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s different kinds of connection, right?</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s different kinds of comedy.</p>
<p>Well, in the sense that.</p>
<p>As we&rsquo;re learning today.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t sure if that was gonna land.</p>
<p>But just the idea that different jokes,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve now done a little bit of standup.</p>
<p>And so different jokes work in different size crowds too.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>Where sometimes if it&rsquo;s a big enough crowd,</p>
<p>then even a really subtle joke can take root someplace</p>
<p>and then that cues other people.</p>
<p>And it kind of,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a whole statistics of.</p>
<p>I did this terrible thing to my brother.</p>
<p>So when I was really young,</p>
<p>I decided that my brother was only laughing</p>
<p>as it comes when I laughed.</p>
<p>Like he was taking cues from me.</p>
<p>So I like purposely didn&rsquo;t laugh</p>
<p>just to see if I was right.</p>
<p>And did you laugh at non funny things?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>You really wanna do both sides.</p>
<p>I did both sides.</p>
<p>And at the end of it, I told him what I did.</p>
<p>He was very upset about this.</p>
<p>And from that day on.</p>
<p>He lost his sense of humor.</p>
<p>No, no, no, no.</p>
<p>Well, yes.</p>
<p>But from that day on, he laughed on his own.</p>
<p>He stopped taking cues from me.</p>
<p>I see.</p>
<p>So I wanna say that it was a good thing that I did.</p>
<p>Yes, yes.</p>
<p>You saved that man&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>Yes, but it was mostly mean.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s true though.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s true, right?</p>
<p>That people, I think you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>But okay, so where does that get us?</p>
<p>That gets us the idea that,</p>
<p>I mean, certainly movie theaters are a thing, right?</p>
<p>Where people like to be watching together,</p>
<p>even though the people on the screen</p>
<p>aren&rsquo;t really co present with the people in the audience.</p>
<p>The audience is co present with themselves.</p>
<p>By the way, and that point,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an open question that&rsquo;s being raised by this,</p>
<p>whether movies will no longer be a thing</p>
<p>because Netflix&rsquo;s audience is growing.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s a very parallel question for education.</p>
<p>Will movie theaters still be a thing in 2021?</p>
<p>No, but I think the argument is</p>
<p>that there is a feeling of being in the crowd</p>
<p>that isn&rsquo;t replicated by being at home watching it</p>
<p>and that there&rsquo;s value in that.</p>
<p>And then I think just.</p>
<p>But, but.</p>
<p>It scales better online.</p>
<p>But I feel like we&rsquo;re having a conversation</p>
<p>about whether concerts will still exist</p>
<p>after the invention of the record or the CD</p>
<p>or wherever it is, right?</p>
<p>They won&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re right, concerts are dead.</p>
<p>Well, okay, I think the joke is only funny</p>
<p>if you say it before now.</p>
<p>Right, yeah, that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>Like three years ago.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, well, no, obviously concerts are still a big thing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll wait to publish this until we have a vaccine.</p>
<p>No, you know, we&rsquo;ll fix it in post.</p>
<p>But I think the important thing is.</p>
<p>Fix the virus post.</p>
<p>Concerts changed, right?</p>
<p>Concerts changed.</p>
<p>First of all, movie theaters weren&rsquo;t this way, right?</p>
<p>In like the 60s and 70s, they weren&rsquo;t like this.</p>
<p>Like blockbusters were basically what?</p>
<p>Well, Jaws and Star Wars created blockbusters, right?</p>
<p>Before then, there weren&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Like the whole shared summer experience</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t exist in our lifetimes, right?</p>
<p>Certainly you were well into adulthood</p>
<p>by the time this was true, right?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s just a very different.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very different.</p>
<p>So what we&rsquo;ve been experiencing in the last 10 years</p>
<p>is not like the majority of human history,</p>
<p>but more importantly, concerts, right?</p>
<p>Concerts mean something different.</p>
<p>Most people don&rsquo;t go to concerts anymore.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s an age where you care about it.</p>
<p>You sort of stop doing it,</p>
<p>but you keep listening to music or whatever</p>
<p>and da, da, da, da, da, da, da.</p>
<p>So I think that&rsquo;s a painful way of saying that</p>
<p>it will change.</p>
<p>It was not the same thing as it going away.</p>
<p>Replace is too strong of a word, but it will change.</p>
<p>It has to.</p>
<p>Actually, like to push back, I wonder,</p>
<p>because I think you&rsquo;re probably just throwing</p>
<p>that your intuition now.</p>
<p>Oh, I wasn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s possible that concerts,</p>
<p>more people go to concerts now,</p>
<p>but obviously much more people listen to,</p>
<p>well, that&rsquo;s dumb, than before there was records.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s possible to argue that if you look at the data,</p>
<p>that it just expanded the pie of what music listening means.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s possible that universities grow in the parallel</p>
<p>or the theaters grow,</p>
<p>but also more people get to watch movies,</p>
<p>more people get to be educated.</p>
<p>Yeah, I hope that is true.</p>
<p>Yeah, and to the extent that we can grow the pie</p>
<p>and have education be not just something you do</p>
<p>for four years when you&rsquo;re done with your other education,</p>
<p>but it be a more lifelong thing,</p>
<p>that would have tremendous benefits,</p>
<p>especially as the economy and the world change rapidly.</p>
<p>People need opportunities to stay abreast of these changes.</p>
<p>And so, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s all part of the ecosystem.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all to the good.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m not gonna have an argument</p>
<p>about whether we lost fidelity</p>
<p>when we went from Laserdisc to DVDs</p>
<p>or record players to CDs.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m willing to grant that that is true,</p>
<p>but convenience matters and the ability to do something</p>
<p>that you couldn&rsquo;t do otherwise</p>
<p>because that convenience matters.</p>
<p>And you can tell me I&rsquo;m only getting 90% of the experience,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m getting the experience.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t getting it before or it wasn&rsquo;t lasting as long</p>
<p>or it wasn&rsquo;t as easy.</p>
<p>I mean, this just seems straightforward to me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna, it&rsquo;s going to change.</p>
<p>It is for the good that more people get access</p>
<p>and it is our job to do two separate things.</p>
<p>One, to educate them and make access available.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s our mission.</p>
<p>But also for very simple selfish reasons,</p>
<p>we need to figure out how to do it better</p>
<p>so that we individually stay in business.</p>
<p>We can do both of those things at the same time.</p>
<p>They are not in, they may be intention,</p>
<p>but they are not mutually exclusive.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve educated some scary number of people.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve seen a lot of people succeed,</p>
<p>find their path through life.</p>
<p>Is there a device that you can give to a young person today</p>
<p>about computer science education,</p>
<p>about education in general, about life,</p>
<p>about whatever the journey that one takes in there,</p>
<p>maybe in their teens, in their early 20s,</p>
<p>sort of in those underground years</p>
<p>as you try to go through the essential process of partying</p>
<p>and not going to classes</p>
<p>and yet somehow trying to get a degree?</p>
<p>If you get to the point where you&rsquo;re far enough up</p>
<p>in the hierarchy of needs that you can actually</p>
<p>make decisions like this,</p>
<p>then find the thing that you&rsquo;re passionate about</p>
<p>and pursue it.</p>
<p>And sometimes it&rsquo;s the thing that drives your life</p>
<p>and sometimes it&rsquo;s secondary.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ll do other things because you&rsquo;ve got to eat, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got a family, you&rsquo;ve got to feed,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got people you have to help or whatever.</p>
<p>And I understand that and it&rsquo;s not easy for everyone,</p>
<p>but always take a moment or two</p>
<p>to pursue the things that you love,</p>
<p>the things that bring passion and happiness to your life.</p>
<p>And if you don&rsquo;t, I know that sounds corny,</p>
<p>but I genuinely believe it.</p>
<p>And if you don&rsquo;t have such a thing,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re lying to yourself.</p>
<p>You have such a thing.</p>
<p>You just have to find it.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s okay if it takes you a long time to get there.</p>
<p>Rodney Dangerfield became a comedian in his 50s, I think.</p>
<p>Certainly wasn&rsquo;t his 20s.</p>
<p>And lots of people failed for a very long time</p>
<p>before getting to where they were going.</p>
<p>I try to have hope and it wasn&rsquo;t obvious.</p>
<p>I mean, you and I talked about the experience that I had</p>
<p>a long time ago with a particular police officer.</p>
<p>Was it my first one and was it my last one?</p>
<p>But in my view, I wasn&rsquo;t supposed to be here after that</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m here.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s all gravy.</p>
<p>So you might as well go ahead and grab life as you can</p>
<p>because of that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s sort of how I see it.</p>
<p>While recognizing, again, the delusion matters, right?</p>
<p>Allow yourself to be deluded.</p>
<p>Allow yourself to believe that it&rsquo;s all gonna work out.</p>
<p>Just don&rsquo;t be so deluded that you miss the obvious.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re gonna be fine.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna be there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna work out.</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>
<p>I like to say choose your parents wisely</p>
<p>because that has a big impact on your life.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s different.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, there&rsquo;s a whole lot of things</p>
<p>that you don&rsquo;t get to pick.</p>
<p>And whether you get to have one kind of life</p>
<p>or a different kind of life can depend a lot</p>
<p>on things out of your control.</p>
<p>But I really do believe in the passion, excitement thing.</p>
<p>My, I was talking to my mom on the phone the other day</p>
<p>and essentially what came out is that computer science</p>
<p>is really popular right now.</p>
<p>And I get to be a professor teaching something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s very attractive to people.</p>
<p>And she was like trying to give me some appreciation</p>
<p>for how foresightful I was for choosing this line of work</p>
<p>as if somehow I knew that this is what was gonna happen</p>
<p>in 2020, but that&rsquo;s not how it went for me at all.</p>
<p>Like I studied computer science</p>
<p>because I was just interested.</p>
<p>It was just so interesting to me.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t think it would be particularly lucrative.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve done everything I&rsquo;ve can to keep it</p>
<p>as unlucrative as possible.</p>
<p>Some of my friends and colleagues have not done that.</p>
<p>And I pride myself on my ability to remain unrich.</p>
<p>But I do believe that, like I&rsquo;m glad.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m glad that it worked out for me.</p>
<p>It could have been like, oh, what I was really fascinated by</p>
<p>is this particular kind of engraving</p>
<p>that nobody cares about.</p>
<p>But so I got lucky and the thing that I cared about</p>
<p>happened to be a thing that other people</p>
<p>eventually cared about.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t think I would have had a fun time</p>
<p>choosing anything else.</p>
<p>Like this was the thing that kept me interested and engaged.</p>
<p>Well, one thing that people tell me,</p>
<p>especially around the early undergraduate,</p>
<p>and the internet is part of the problem here,</p>
<p>is they say they&rsquo;re passionate about so many things.</p>
<p>How do I choose a thing?</p>
<p>Which is a harder thing for me to know what to do with.</p>
<p>Is there any?</p>
<p>I mean, don&rsquo;t you know which, I mean, you know, look.</p>
<p>A long time ago, I walked down a hallway</p>
<p>and I took a left turn.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I could have taken a right turn.</p>
<p>And my world could be better or it could be worse.</p>
<p>I have no idea.</p>
<p>I have no way of knowing.</p>
<p>Is there anything about this particular hallway</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s relevant or you&rsquo;re just in general choices?</p>
<p>Yeah, you were on the left.</p>
<p>It sounds like you regret not taking the right turn.</p>
<p>Oh no, not at all.</p>
<p>You brought it up.</p>
<p>Well, because there was a turn there.</p>
<p>On the left was Michael Newman&rsquo;s office, right?</p>
<p>I mean, these sorts of things happen, right?</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>On the right, by the way, there was just a blank wall.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t a huge choice.</p>
<p>It would have really hurt.</p>
<p>He tried first.</p>
<p>No, but it&rsquo;s true, right?</p>
<p>You know, I think about Ron Brockman, right?</p>
<p>I went, I took a trip I wasn&rsquo;t supposed to take</p>
<p>and I ended up talking to Ron about this</p>
<p>and I ended up going down this entire path</p>
<p>that allowed me to, I think, get tenure.</p>
<p>But by the way, I decided to say yes to something</p>
<p>that didn&rsquo;t make any sense</p>
<p>and I went down this educational path.</p>
<p>But it would have been, you know, who knows, right?</p>
<p>Maybe if I hadn&rsquo;t done that,</p>
<p>I would be a billionaire right now.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be Elon Musk.</p>
<p>My life could be so much better.</p>
<p>My life could also be so much worse.</p>
<p>You know, you just gotta feel that sometimes</p>
<p>you have decisions you&rsquo;re gonna make.</p>
<p>You cannot know what&rsquo;s gonna do.</p>
<p>You should think about it, right?</p>
<p>Some things are clearly smarter than other things.</p>
<p>You gotta play the odds a little bit.</p>
<p>But in the end, if you&rsquo;ve got multiple choices,</p>
<p>there are lots of things you think you might love.</p>
<p>Go with the thing that you actually love,</p>
<p>the thing that jumps out at you</p>
<p>and sort of pursue it for a little while.</p>
<p>The worst thing that&rsquo;ll happen is you took a left turn</p>
<p>instead of a right turn and you ended up merely happy.</p>
<p>Beautiful.</p>
<p>So, so accepting, so taking the step</p>
<p>and just accepting, accepting that,</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t like question, question the choice.</p>
<p>Life is long and there&rsquo;s time to actually pursue.</p>
<p>Every once in a while, you have to put on a leather suit</p>
<p>and make a thriller video.</p>
<p>Every once in a while.</p>
<p>If I ever get the chance again, I&rsquo;m doing it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I was told that you actually dance,</p>
<p>but that part was edited out.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t dance.</p>
<p>There was a thing where we did do the zombie thing.</p>
<p>We did do the zombie thing.</p>
<p>That wasn&rsquo;t edited out.</p>
<p>It just wasn&rsquo;t put into the final thing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m quite happy.</p>
<p>There was a reason for that too, right?</p>
<p>Like I wasn&rsquo;t wearing something right.</p>
<p>There was a reason for that.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t remember what it was.</p>
<p>No leather suit.</p>
<p>Is that what it was?</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t remember.</p>
<p>Anyway, the right thing happened.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>You took the left turn and ended up being the right thing.</p>
<p>So a lot of people ask me that are a little bit</p>
<p>tangential to the programming and the computing world</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re interested to learn programming,</p>
<p>like all kinds of disciplines that are outside</p>
<p>of the particular discipline of computer science.</p>
<p>What advice do you have for people</p>
<p>that want to learn how to program</p>
<p>or want to either taste this little skill set</p>
<p>or discipline or try to see if it can be used somehow</p>
<p>in their own life?</p>
<p>What stage of life are they in?</p>
<p>One of the magic things about the internet</p>
<p>of the people that write me is I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Because my answer&rsquo;s different for, my daughter</p>
<p>is taking AP computer science right now.</p>
<p>Hi, Joni.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s amazing and doing amazing things</p>
<p>and my son&rsquo;s beginning to get interested</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll be really curious where he takes it.</p>
<p>I think his mind actually works very well</p>
<p>for this sort of thing and she&rsquo;s doing great.</p>
<p>But one of the things I have to tell her all the time,</p>
<p>she points, well, I want to make a rhythm game.</p>
<p>So I want to go for two weeks and then build a rhythm game.</p>
<p>Show me how to build a rhythm game.</p>
<p>Start small, learn the building blocks</p>
<p>and how to take the time.</p>
<p>Have patience, eventually you&rsquo;ll build a rhythm game.</p>
<p>I was in grad school when I suddenly woke up one day</p>
<p>over the Royal East and I thought, wait a minute,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a computer scientist.</p>
<p>I should be able to write Pac Man in an afternoon.</p>
<p>And I did, not with great graphics.</p>
<p>It was actually a very cool game.</p>
<p>I had to figure out how the ghost moved and everything</p>
<p>and I did it in an afternoon in Pascal</p>
<p>on an old Apple 2GS.</p>
<p>But if I had started out trying to build Pac Man,</p>
<p>I think it probably would have ended very poorly for me.</p>
<p>Luckily back then, there weren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>these magical devices we call phones</p>
<p>and software everywhere to give me this illusion</p>
<p>that I could create something by myself</p>
<p>from the basics inside of a weekend like that.</p>
<p>I mean, that was a culmination of years and years and years</p>
<p>right before I decided, oh, I should be able to write this</p>
<p>and I could.</p>
<p>So my advice if you&rsquo;re early on is you&rsquo;ve got the internet.</p>
<p>There are lots of people there to give you the information.</p>
<p>Find someone who cares about this.</p>
<p>Remember, they&rsquo;ve been doing it for a very long time.</p>
<p>Take it slow, learn the little pieces, get excited about it</p>
<p>and then keep the big project you want to build in mind.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll get there soon enough.</p>
<p>Because as a wise man once said, life is long.</p>
<p>Sometimes it doesn&rsquo;t seem that long, but it is long</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll have enough time to build it all out.</p>
<p>All the information is out there, but start small.</p>
<p>Generate Fibonacci numbers.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not exciting, but it&rsquo;ll get you the language.</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s only one programming language, it&rsquo;s Lisp.</p>
<p>But if you have to pick a programming language,</p>
<p>I guess in today&rsquo;s day, what would I do?</p>
<p>I guess I&rsquo;d do.</p>
<p>Python is basically Lisp, but with better syntax.</p>
<p>Blasphemy.</p>
<p>Yeah, with C syntax, how about that?</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re gonna argue that C syntax</p>
<p>is better than anything?</p>
<p>Anyway, also I&rsquo;m gonna answer Python despite what he said.</p>
<p>Tell your story about somebody&rsquo;s dissertation</p>
<p>that had a Lisp program in it.</p>
<p>It was so funny.</p>
<p>This is Dave&rsquo;s, Dave&rsquo;s dissertation was like,</p>
<p>Dave McAllister, who was a professor at MIT for a while</p>
<p>and then he came to Bell Labs and now he&rsquo;s at</p>
<p>Technology Technical Institute of Chicago.</p>
<p>A brilliant guy.</p>
<p>Such an interesting guy.</p>
<p>Anyway, his thesis, it was a theorem prover</p>
<p>and he decided to have as an appendix his actual code,</p>
<p>which of course was all written in Lisp</p>
<p>because of course it was.</p>
<p>And like the last 20 pages are just right parenthesis.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just wonderful.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s programming right there.</p>
<p>Pages upon pages of right parenthesis.</p>
<p>Anyway, Lisp is the only real language,</p>
<p>but I understand that that&rsquo;s not necessarily</p>
<p>the place where you start.</p>
<p>Python is just fine.</p>
<p>Python is good.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re, you know, of a certain age,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re really young and trying to figure it out,</p>
<p>graphical languages that let you kind of see</p>
<p>how the thing works and that&rsquo;s fine too.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all fine.</p>
<p>It almost doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>But there are people who spend a lot of time</p>
<p>thinking about how to build languages that get people in.</p>
<p>The question is, are you trying to get in</p>
<p>and figure out what it is?</p>
<p>Or do you already know what you want?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why I asked you what stage of life people are in</p>
<p>because if you&rsquo;re different stages of life,</p>
<p>you would attack it differently.</p>
<p>The answer to that question of which language</p>
<p>keeps changing, I mean, there&rsquo;s some value</p>
<p>to exploring, a lot of people write to me about Julia.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s these like more modern languages</p>
<p>that keep being invented, Rust and Kotlin.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s stuff that, for people who love</p>
<p>functional languages like Lisp,</p>
<p>that apparently there&rsquo;s echoes of that,</p>
<p>but much better in the modern languages.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s worthwhile to,</p>
<p>especially when you&rsquo;re learning languages,</p>
<p>it feels like it&rsquo;s okay to try one</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not like the popular one.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, but you want something simple.</p>
<p>And I think you get that way of thinking</p>
<p>almost no matter what language.</p>
<p>And if you push far enough,</p>
<p>like it can be assembly language,</p>
<p>but you need to push pretty far</p>
<p>before you start to hit the really deep concepts</p>
<p>that you would get sooner in other languages.</p>
<p>But like, I don&rsquo;t know, computation is kind of computation,</p>
<p>is kind of Turing equivalent, is kind of computation.</p>
<p>And so it matters how you express things,</p>
<p>but you have to build out that mental structure</p>
<p>in your mind.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s super matters which language.</p>
<p>I mean, it matters a little,</p>
<p>because some things are just</p>
<p>at the wrong level of abstraction.</p>
<p>I think assembly is at the wrong level of abstraction</p>
<p>for someone coming in new.</p>
<p>I think that if you start.</p>
<p>For someone coming in new.</p>
<p>Yes, for frameworks, big frameworks are quite a bit.</p>
<p>You know, you&rsquo;ve got to get to the point</p>
<p>where I want to learn a new language,</p>
<p>means I just pick up a reference book</p>
<p>and I think of a project and I go through it in a weekend.</p>
<p>Right, you got to get there.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re right though, the languages that are designed</p>
<p>for that are, it almost doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>Pick the ones that people have built tutorials</p>
<p>and infrastructure around to help you get kind of,</p>
<p>kind of ease into it.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s hard.</p>
<p>I mean, I did this little experiment once.</p>
<p>I was teaching intro to CS in the summer as a favor.</p>
<p>Which is, anyway.</p>
<p>I was teaching.</p>
<p>I was teaching intro to CS as a favor.</p>
<p>And it was very funny because I&rsquo;d go in every single time</p>
<p>and I would think to myself,</p>
<p>how am I possibly going to fill up an hour and a half</p>
<p>talking about for loops, right?</p>
<p>And there wasn&rsquo;t enough time.</p>
<p>Took me a while to realize this, right?</p>
<p>There are only three things, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s reading from a variable,</p>
<p>writing to a variable and conditional branching.</p>
<p>Everything else is syntactic sugar, right?</p>
<p>The syntactic sugar matters, but that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>And when I say that&rsquo;s it, I don&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s simple.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s hard.</p>
<p>Like conditional branching, loops, variable.</p>
<p>Those are really hard concepts.</p>
<p>So you shouldn&rsquo;t be discouraged by this.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a simple experiment.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna ask you a question now.</p>
<p>You ready?</p>
<p>X equals three.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Y equals four.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>What is X?</p>
<p>Three.</p>
<p>What is Y?</p>
<p>Four.</p>
<p>Y equals X.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna mess this up.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s easy.</p>
<p>Y equals X.</p>
<p>What is Y?</p>
<p>Three.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>X equals seven.</p>
<p>What is Y?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one of the trickiest things to get for programmers,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a memory and the variables are pointing</p>
<p>to a particular thing in memory,</p>
<p>and sometimes the languages hide that from you</p>
<p>and they bring it closer</p>
<p>to the way you think mathematics works.</p>
<p>Right, so in fact, Mark Guzdal,</p>
<p>who worries about these sorts of things,</p>
<p>or used to worry about these sorts of things anyway,</p>
<p>had this kind of belief that actually,</p>
<p>people when they see these statements,</p>
<p>X equals something, Y equals something, Y equals X,</p>
<p>that you have now made a mathematical statement</p>
<p>that Y and X are the same.</p>
<p>Which you can if you just put like an anchor in front of it.</p>
<p>Yes, but people, that&rsquo;s not what you&rsquo;re doing, right?</p>
<p>I thought, and I kind of asked the question,</p>
<p>and I think I had some evidence for this,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hardly a study,</p>
<p>is that most of the people who didn&rsquo;t know the answer,</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t sure about the answer, they had used spreadsheets.</p>
<p>Ah, interesting.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s by reference, or by name really, right?</p>
<p>And so depending upon what you think they are,</p>
<p>you get completely different answers.</p>
<p>The fact that I could go, or one could go,</p>
<p>two thirds of the way through a semester,</p>
<p>and people still hadn&rsquo;t figured out in their heads,</p>
<p>when you say Y equals X, what that meant,</p>
<p>tells you it&rsquo;s actually hard.</p>
<p>Because all those answers are possible,</p>
<p>and in fact, when you said,</p>
<p>oh, if you just put an ampersand in front of it,</p>
<p>I mean, that doesn&rsquo;t make any sense for an intro class,</p>
<p>and of course a lot of languages</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t even give you the ability</p>
<p>to think about it in terms of ampersand.</p>
<p>Do we want to have a 45 minute discussion</p>
<p>about the difference between equal EQ and equal in Lisp?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I know you do.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>But you know, you could do that.</p>
<p>This is actually really hard stuff.</p>
<p>So you shouldn&rsquo;t be, it&rsquo;s not too hard, we all do it,</p>
<p>but you shouldn&rsquo;t be discouraged.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s why you should start small,</p>
<p>so that you can figure out these things,</p>
<p>so you have the right model in your head,</p>
<p>so that when you write the language,</p>
<p>you can execute it, and build the machine</p>
<p>that you want to build, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, the funny thing about programming,</p>
<p>and those very basic things,</p>
<p>is the very basics are not often made explicit,</p>
<p>which is actually what drives everybody away</p>
<p>from basically any discipline,</p>
<p>but programming is just another one.</p>
<p>Like even a simpler version of the equal sign</p>
<p>that I kind of forget, is in mathematics,</p>
<p>equals is not assignment.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Like, I think basically every single programming language</p>
<p>with just a few handful of exceptions,</p>
<p>equals is assignment.</p>
<p>And you have some other operator for equality.</p>
<p>And even that, like everyone kind of knows it,</p>
<p>once you started doing it,</p>
<p>but like you need to say that explicitly,</p>
<p>or you just realize it, like yourself.</p>
<p>Otherwise you might be stuck for,</p>
<p>you said like half a semester,</p>
<p>you could be stuck for quite a long time.</p>
<p>And I think also part of the programming</p>
<p>is being okay in that state of confusion for a while.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s to the debugging point.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, I just wrote two lines of code,</p>
<p>why doesn&rsquo;t this work?</p>
<p>And staring at that for like hours,</p>
<p>and trying to figure out.</p>
<p>And then every once in a while,</p>
<p>you just have to restart your computer</p>
<p>and everything works again.</p>
<p>And then you just kind of stare into the void</p>
<p>with the tear slowly rolling down your eye.</p>
<p>By the way, the fact that they didn&rsquo;t get this</p>
<p>actually had no impact on,</p>
<p>I mean, they were still able to do their assignments.</p>
<p>Because it turns out their misunderstanding</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t being revealed to them</p>
<p>by the problem sets we were giving them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty profound actually, yeah.</p>
<p>I wrote a program a long time ago,</p>
<p>actually for my master&rsquo;s thesis,</p>
<p>and in C++ I think, or C, I guess it was C.</p>
<p>And it was all memory management and terrible.</p>
<p>And it wouldn&rsquo;t work for a while.</p>
<p>And it was some kind of,</p>
<p>it was clear to me that it was overriding memory.</p>
<p>And I just couldn&rsquo;t, I was like,</p>
<p>look, I got to pay for this time for this.</p>
<p>So I basically declared a variable</p>
<p>at the front in the main that was like 400K,</p>
<p>just an array, and it worked.</p>
<p>Because wherever I was scribbling over memory,</p>
<p>it would scribble into that space and it didn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>And so I never figured out what the bug was.</p>
<p>But I did create something to sort of deal with it.</p>
<p>To work around it.</p>
<p>And it, you know, that&rsquo;s crazy, that&rsquo;s crazy.</p>
<p>It was okay, because that&rsquo;s what I wanted.</p>
<p>But I knew enough about memory managed to go,</p>
<p>you know, management to go, you know,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just going to create an empty array here</p>
<p>and hope that that deals with this scribbling memory problem.</p>
<p>And it did.</p>
<p>That takes a long time to figure out.</p>
<p>And by the way, the language you first learned</p>
<p>probably just garbage collection anyway,</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re not even going to come up across,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not going to come across that problem.</p>
<p>So we talked about the Minsky idea</p>
<p>of hating everything you do and hating yourself.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s end on a question</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to make both of you very uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Which is, what is your, Charles,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s your favorite thing that you&rsquo;re grateful for</p>
<p>about Michael?</p>
<p>And Michael, what is your favorite thing</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re grateful for about Charles?</p>
<p>Well, that answer is actually quite easy.</p>
<p>His friendship.</p>
<p>He stole the easy answer.</p>
<p>I did.</p>
<p>Yeah, I can tell you what I hate about Charles,</p>
<p>he steals my good answers.</p>
<p>The thing I like most about Charles,</p>
<p>he sees the world in a similar enough,</p>
<p>but different way that I,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s sort of like having another life.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sort of like I get to experience things</p>
<p>that I wouldn&rsquo;t otherwise get to experience</p>
<p>because I would not naturally gravitate to them that way.</p>
<p>And so he just, he just shows me a whole other world.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s awesome.</p>
<p>Yeah, the inner product is not zero for sure.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not quite one, 0.7 maybe.</p>
<p>Just enough that you can learn.</p>
<p>Just enough that you can learn.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the definition of friendship.</p>
<p>The inner product is 0.7.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think so.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the answer to life really.</p>
<p>Charles sometimes believes in me</p>
<p>when I have not believed in me.</p>
<p>He also sometimes works as an outward confidence</p>
<p>that he has so much, so much confidence and self,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, comfortableness.</p>
<p>Okay, let&rsquo;s go with that.</p>
<p>That I feel better a little bit.</p>
<p>If he thinks I&rsquo;m okay,</p>
<p>then maybe I&rsquo;m not as bad as I think I am.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, luck favors the Charles.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a huge honor to talk with you.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for taking this time,</p>
<p>wasting your time with me.</p>
<p>It was an awesome conversation.</p>
<p>You guys are an inspiration to a huge number of people</p>
<p>and to me, so really enjoyed this.</p>
<p>Thanks for talking to me.</p>
<p>I enjoyed it as well.</p>
<p>Thank you so much.</p>
<p>And by the way, if luck favors the Charles,</p>
<p>then it&rsquo;s certainly the case</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve been very lucky to know you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna edit that part out.</p>
