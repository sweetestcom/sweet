    <p>Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>where we discuss science</p>
<p>and science-based tools for everyday life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Andrew Huberman,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology</p>
<p>at Stanford School of Medicine.</p>
<p>Today, we are discussing caffeine.</p>
<p>Caffeine is one of the most widely used substances</p>
<p>on the planet.</p>
<p>Estimates are that more than 90% of adults</p>
<p>and as many as 50% of kids,</p>
<p>that is adolescents and teenagers,</p>
<p>use caffeine on a daily basis.</p>
<p>Caffeine is an amazing molecule.</p>
<p>Most people are familiar with caffeine&rsquo;s ability</p>
<p>to increase alertness</p>
<p>and to reduce our feelings of sleepiness and fatigue.</p>
<p>And indeed, it does that.</p>
<p>But what most people are not aware of</p>
<p>is that caffeine acts as a strong reinforcer.</p>
<p>What I mean by reinforcer</p>
<p>is that when caffeine is present in a drink or food,</p>
<p>and yes, indeed, caffeine is present in many foods,</p>
<p>even unbeknownst to us,</p>
<p>when it&rsquo;s present in drinks and foods,</p>
<p>we actively come to like those foods and drinks more</p>
<p>than if caffeine were not contained</p>
<p>in those foods and drinks.</p>
<p>So it reinforces our liking</p>
<p>of particular foods and drinks,</p>
<p>and indeed, it even reinforces our liking</p>
<p>of the containers they are consumed from</p>
<p>and the company we keep</p>
<p>when we consume foods and drinks that contain caffeine.</p>
<p>That is, caffeine is not just a stimulant.</p>
<p>Caffeine is a reinforcer,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a reinforcer that plays an active role</p>
<p>in almost everybody&rsquo;s daily life.</p>
<p>We can say that with confidence</p>
<p>because as I mentioned a moment ago,</p>
<p>more than 90% of people are consuming caffeine,</p>
<p>and most people think that they consume caffeine</p>
<p>because it makes them feel more alert.</p>
<p>But there are many reasons why you&rsquo;re consuming caffeine,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m not going to tell you</p>
<p>that consuming caffeine is necessarily bad.</p>
<p>In fact, today, I&rsquo;m going to tell you</p>
<p>about many of the positive health benefits of caffeine,</p>
<p>including neuroprotective effects,</p>
<p>antidepressive effects,</p>
<p>and certainly performance-enhancing effects,</p>
<p>both for mental performance and for physical performance.</p>
<p>Now, that said, there are certain situations</p>
<p>in which you want to avoid caffeine,</p>
<p>and there are certain people who might opt to avoid caffeine.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s especially the case when one thinks about caffeine</p>
<p>not just as a stimulant, but as a reinforcer.</p>
<p>In fact, caffeine is such a strong reinforcer</p>
<p>that if even tiny amounts of caffeine are present</p>
<p>in certain foods and drinks,</p>
<p>you will very quickly come to prefer those foods and drinks</p>
<p>over other choices,</p>
<p>which can be a good thing or a bad thing,</p>
<p>depending on what sorts of food and drink choices</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re trying to make.</p>
<p>So today, I&rsquo;m going to inform you</p>
<p>about how caffeine works at a mechanistic level.</p>
<p>I promise to do that with a minimum of nomenclature</p>
<p>and such that even if you don&rsquo;t have a background</p>
<p>in biology, you will be able to digest</p>
<p>that information easily.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;ll tell you how to use caffeine</p>
<p>to your advantage, or conversely,</p>
<p>how to avoid caffeine at certain times to your advantage.</p>
<p>So today&rsquo;s episode will focus both on mechanisms and tools</p>
<p>that is the use and leverage of caffeine</p>
<p>to improve mental health, physical health, and performance.</p>
<p>Before we go any further into today&rsquo;s discussion,</p>
<p>I want to tell you about some recent results</p>
<p>about a molecule that&rsquo;s found</p>
<p>in certain caffeinated beverages,</p>
<p>and that has been proven to be very useful</p>
<p>for both weight loss, mental performance,</p>
<p>and controlling blood sugar levels.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s GLP-1, or glucagon-like peptide one.</p>
<p>Glucagon-like peptide one is found in the brain and body.</p>
<p>It acts both on the brain and body.</p>
<p>It does many different things,</p>
<p>but one of its primary effects it&rsquo;s been discovered</p>
<p>is to reduce hunger, and it does that two ways.</p>
<p>It does that by activating certain neurons</p>
<p>in your hypothalamus, so that&rsquo;s a brain region</p>
<p>that controls hunger and satiety.</p>
<p>It makes us feel full at the level of the brain,</p>
<p>so it makes us feel sated, that is,</p>
<p>and it actually makes us feel full.</p>
<p>Turns out that GLP-1 acts on certain receptors in the gut</p>
<p>to make us feel as if we&rsquo;ve ingested enough food.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t necessarily make us feel</p>
<p>as if our gut is distended, but it makes us feel full.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really interesting because if you think about it,</p>
<p>when we eat, our stomach fills up, obviously,</p>
<p>and that information has to be communicated to the brain</p>
<p>such that the brain can then send satiety signals</p>
<p>that actually shut off our hunger.</p>
<p>And believe it or not, the brain actually activates signals</p>
<p>to reduce the desire to chew when our stomach is full.</p>
<p>And GLP-1, as I mentioned, works on the brain</p>
<p>to create these feelings of satiety,</p>
<p>as if we&rsquo;ve had enough,</p>
<p>and to reduce our desire to eat more.</p>
<p>And GLP-1 acts directly on the gut</p>
<p>to give us a slight sense of fullness in the gut,</p>
<p>which then is communicated to the brain.</p>
<p>So really, there are two parallel signals being sent</p>
<p>when we have GLP-1 present in our system.</p>
<p>Now, a little bit of relevant history on GLP-1.</p>
<p>It was actually discovered in Gila monsters.</p>
<p>These are these reptiles</p>
<p>that can go long periods of time without eating,</p>
<p>and a very clever scientist decided to study why it is</p>
<p>that certain animals, like Gila monsters,</p>
<p>can go a long period of time without ingesting anything.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s because they produce very large amounts of GLP-1.</p>
<p>They isolate the peptide from GLP-1,</p>
<p>then they looked for the analogous peptide in humans,</p>
<p>and it turns out that does exist.</p>
<p>And as I mentioned, it&rsquo;s released in both brain and body</p>
<p>to make you feel full and sated.</p>
<p>Why am I telling you all this?</p>
<p>Well, today we&rsquo;re going to talk about caffeine,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s one particular caffeine source,</p>
<p>which is yerba mate.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s some other forms of teas,</p>
<p>similar to yerba mate,</p>
<p>that stimulate the release of GLP-1 significantly.</p>
<p>There are also nowadays drugs</p>
<p>which are called analogs of GLP-1.</p>
<p>So these are drugs that mimic or are identical</p>
<p>to the kind of GLP-1 that you would make.</p>
<p>And those drugs are proving to be very effective</p>
<p>for the treatment of certain forms of diabetes</p>
<p>and for the treatment of obesity.</p>
<p>But they trigger enormous amounts</p>
<p>of GLP-1 pathway activation.</p>
<p>So those are extreme cases for people</p>
<p>that are really struggling for weight loss.</p>
<p>But the clinical trials and the data that are out there</p>
<p>in the general population now are very, very promising</p>
<p>for GLP-1 analogs.</p>
<p>Yerba mate tea, provided it&rsquo;s not the smoked variety,</p>
<p>and I mentioned that because a number of people</p>
<p>have cued me to the fact that yerba mate teas</p>
<p>come in smoked varieties and non-smoked varieties,</p>
<p>and the smoked varieties are thought</p>
<p>to perhaps be carcinogenic, that is pro-cancer causing.</p>
<p>So I advise people to avoid smoked varieties</p>
<p>of yerba mate tea.</p>
<p>But yerba mate teas are known to stimulate</p>
<p>significant amounts of GLP-1 release.</p>
<p>And so they can be effective as a weight loss tool,</p>
<p>mainly by blunting appetite.</p>
<p>And again, they do that both at the level of the brain</p>
<p>and at the level of the gut.</p>
<p>Now, all of what I just told you has been known</p>
<p>for some period of time, but there are a new set of findings</p>
<p>that were just published in Cell Reports Medicine,</p>
<p>Cell Press Journal, excellent journal,</p>
<p>which indicate exactly how it is that GLP-1</p>
<p>stimulates both satiety and can trigger additional weight</p>
<p>loss through other mechanisms.</p>
<p>And I find the mechanism to be really interesting</p>
<p>and actually really important, given some other topics</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve covered on this podcast before.</p>
<p>So the basic finding is that GLP-1,</p>
<p>whether or not it&rsquo;s stimulated through the release</p>
<p>of a analog drug that one is prescribed</p>
<p>or by drinking yerba mate tea, for instance,</p>
<p>and stimulate release of your own so-called endogenous GLP-1,</p>
<p>yes, it makes you feel more full</p>
<p>at the level of brain and body,</p>
<p>but it turns out it also stimulates thermogenesis.</p>
<p>Now, thermogenesis is the active utilization</p>
<p>of more metabolic energy.</p>
<p>And fat cells, in particular,</p>
<p>so-called beige and brown fat cells</p>
<p>are a potent source of thermogenic activity in your body.</p>
<p>The basic background is that you have white adipose cells,</p>
<p>so white fat cells, you have beige fat cells,</p>
<p>and you have brown fat cells.</p>
<p>And the beige and brown ones are fat cells</p>
<p>that you actually want more of.</p>
<p>They are not abundant under your skin,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re abundant really around your clavicles</p>
<p>and your upper neck.</p>
<p>They are the ones that generate heat</p>
<p>and the beige and brownness of them</p>
<p>is actually the consequence</p>
<p>of having a lot of mitochondria in those cells.</p>
<p>When GLP-1 is elevated in your system,</p>
<p>it turns out that it communicates to those white fat cells</p>
<p>and helps convert them into beige and brown fat cells.</p>
<p>That is, it takes fat cells</p>
<p>that are not doing anything useful for you</p>
<p>except being stored energy.</p>
<p>And I think most people out there</p>
<p>would like to have fewer of those white adipose cells.</p>
<p>There are a few of you out there</p>
<p>that actually need more of them,</p>
<p>that are too thin, too lean,</p>
<p>but most people are suffering</p>
<p>from having too many of these white adipose cells.</p>
<p>Well, when you ingest yerba mate tea</p>
<p>or you were to take a GLP-1 analog</p>
<p>or stimulate GLP-1 in any number of different ways,</p>
<p>yes, you stimulate increased satiety,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re also stimulating the conversion</p>
<p>of these white fat cells into beige and brown fat cells,</p>
<p>which makes you more thermogenic</p>
<p>and over time raises your basal metabolic rate.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re burning more calories even at rest.</p>
<p>It also makes you feel as if you&rsquo;re more comfortable</p>
<p>in colder environments at rest.</p>
<p>This is very much the same as the mechanism</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s induced when you were to say, take a cold shower</p>
<p>or do regular ice baths or get into cold water regularly.</p>
<p>That too stimulates the conversion of white fat cells</p>
<p>to beige and brown fat cells.</p>
<p>So I like these findings very much</p>
<p>because they provide a mechanistic coherence.</p>
<p>They provide that is a really nice story</p>
<p>as to how something like GLP-1</p>
<p>could be so effective for weight loss.</p>
<p>Yes, on the one hand, GLP-1 is reducing appetite</p>
<p>and that of course will help people maintain or lose weight,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also increasing basal metabolic rate.</p>
<p>And we now know how that&rsquo;s accomplished.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s likely accomplished at least through this one mechanism</p>
<p>by the stimulation of conversion of these white fat cells,</p>
<p>which don&rsquo;t do much for us except as energy storage units</p>
<p>to these metabolically mitochondrial rich beige</p>
<p>and brown fat cells,</p>
<p>which you can think of as sort of the oil in the candle</p>
<p>that allows your furnace, your metabolism to burn</p>
<p>at a higher temperature and a higher rate.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the mechanism.</p>
<p>And the basic tool takeaway is that</p>
<p>if you are somebody who&rsquo;s interested in losing weight</p>
<p>and you want to leverage the GLP-1 pathway,</p>
<p>drinking a cup or two of yerba mate tea early in the day</p>
<p>would be a great way to stimulate GLP-1 release.</p>
<p>There are other ways to stimulate GLP-1 release.</p>
<p>You can get it through certain forms of exercise,</p>
<p>in particular fasted exercise.</p>
<p>This is actually a vote in favor of fasted exercise.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a debate as to whether or not fasted cardio</p>
<p>burns more fat than non-fasted cardio.</p>
<p>And the data basically say, no, it doesn&rsquo;t really matter,</p>
<p>but that doesn&rsquo;t really take into account</p>
<p>the longer arc of things like GLP-1 release.</p>
<p>So that needs to be taken into consideration.</p>
<p>So you could do fasted cardio,</p>
<p>you could drink yerba mate tea,</p>
<p>keeping in mind that yerba mate tea does contain caffeine.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll talk more about the specific forms of stimulants,</p>
<p>including caffeine that mate has.</p>
<p>But mate would be a great way to stimulate GLP-1 release.</p>
<p>And then of course, for those of you that are interested</p>
<p>in more robust activation of GLP-1,</p>
<p>then perhaps you might want to consider</p>
<p>some of the new prescription GLP-1 analogs</p>
<p>that are out there,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s a more severe stimulus for GLP-1, of course.</p>
<p>And for everybody, regardless of whether or not</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re trying to lose weight, gain weight, or maintain weight</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re going to be hearing a lot more</p>
<p>about GLP-1 analogs and drinks and supplements</p>
<p>and things of that sort that stimulate GLP-1</p>
<p>in the very near future,</p>
<p>because it does appear to be a very important</p>
<p>biological mechanism.</p>
<p>Before we begin, I&rsquo;d like to emphasize that this podcast</p>
<p>is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.</p>
<p>It is however, part of my desire and effort</p>
<p>to bring zero cost to consumer information about science</p>
<p>and science related tools to the general public.</p>
<p>In keeping with that theme,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank the sponsors of today&rsquo;s podcast.</p>
<p>Our first sponsor is Element.</p>
<p>Element is an electrolyte drink with everything you need</p>
<p>and nothing you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>That means plenty of salt, magnesium, and potassium,</p>
<p>the so-called electrolytes, and no sugar.</p>
<p>Now, salt, magnesium, and potassium are critical</p>
<p>to the function of all the cells in your body,</p>
<p>in particular to the function of your nerve cells,</p>
<p>also called neurons.</p>
<p>In fact, in order for your neurons to function properly,</p>
<p>all three electrolytes need to be present</p>
<p>in the proper ratios.</p>
<p>And we now know that even slight reductions</p>
<p>in electrolyte concentrations or dehydration of the body</p>
<p>can lead to deficits in cognitive and physical performance.</p>
<p>Element contains a science-backed electrolyte ratio</p>
<p>of 1,000 milligrams, that&rsquo;s one gram, of sodium,</p>
<p>200 milligrams of potassium,</p>
<p>and 60 milligrams of magnesium.</p>
<p>I typically drink Element first thing in the morning</p>
<p>when I wake up in order to hydrate my body</p>
<p>and make sure I have enough electrolytes.</p>
<p>And while I do any kind of physical training</p>
<p>and after physical training as well,</p>
<p>especially if I&rsquo;ve been sweating a lot.</p>

<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Thesis.</p>
<p>Thesis makes what are called nootropics,</p>
<p>which means smart drugs.</p>
<p>Now, to be honest, I am not a fan of the term nootropics.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe in smart drugs in the sense that</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe that there&rsquo;s any one substance</p>
<p>or collection of substances that can make us smarter.</p>
<p>I do believe based on science, however,</p>
<p>that there are particular neural circuits</p>
<p>and brain functions that allow us to be more focused,</p>
<p>more alert, access creativity, be more motivated, et cetera.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just the way that the brain works.</p>
<p>Different neural circuits for different brain states.</p>
<p>Thesis understands this.</p>
<p>And as far as I know, they&rsquo;re the first nootropics company</p>
<p>to create targeted nootropics for specific outcomes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Thesis for more than six months now,</p>
<p>and I can confidently say that their nootropics</p>
<p>have been a total game changer.</p>
<p>My go-to formula is the clarity formula,</p>
<p>or sometimes I&rsquo;ll use their energy formula before training.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m pleased to announce that the Huberman Lab podcast</p>
<p>is now partnered with Momentus Supplements.</p>
<p>We partnered with Momentus for several important reasons.</p>
<p>First of all, they ship internationally</p>
<p>because we know that many of you are located</p>
<p>outside of the United States.</p>
<p>Second of all, and perhaps most important,</p>
<p>the quality of their supplements is second to none,</p>
<p>both in terms of purity and precision</p>
<p>of the amounts of the ingredients.</p>
<p>Third, we&rsquo;ve really emphasized supplements</p>
<p>that are single ingredient supplements</p>
<p>and that are supplied in dosages</p>
<p>that allow you to build a supplementation protocol</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for cost,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for effectiveness,</p>
<p>and that you can add things and remove things</p>
<p>from your protocol in a way</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really systematic and scientific.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to see the supplements</p>
<p>that we partner with Momentus on,</p>
<p>you can go to livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>There you&rsquo;ll see those supplements,</p>
<p>and just keep in mind that we are constantly expanding</p>
<p>the library of supplements available through Momentus</p>
<p>on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about caffeine.</p>
<p>So as I mentioned earlier,</p>
<p>caffeine is consumed by basically most all adults</p>
<p>every single day</p>
<p>and consumed at very regular times each day.</p>
<p>In fact, if you were to take a look at your caffeine intake</p>
<p>or the caffeine intake of somebody close to you,</p>
<p>what you would realize is that they don&rsquo;t do so well</p>
<p>if their caffeine intake arrives even 10, 20,</p>
<p>or 30 minutes past their expected</p>
<p>or usual intake of caffeine.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s pretty remarkable,</p>
<p>and it brings to mind ideas</p>
<p>that we are all quote-unquote addicted to caffeine</p>
<p>or that caffeine is somehow bad.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m certainly not going to make the argument</p>
<p>that caffeine is bad.</p>
<p>First of all, I&rsquo;m a regular caffeine user.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t call myself a caffeine abuser,</p>
<p>but I am a regular caffeine user,</p>
<p>and caffeine is known to have certain health benefits.</p>
<p>I listed off a few of them earlier,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ll mention those again now before going forward.</p>
<p>Caffeine is known to have certain neuroprotective effects,</p>
<p>and that is because of its ability</p>
<p>to increase neuromodulators such as dopamine,</p>
<p>but also other so-called catecholamines like norepinephrine.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t know what those names mean,</p>
<p>these are molecules that increase levels of alertness,</p>
<p>motivation, and drive,</p>
<p>and so then therefore not surprisingly,</p>
<p>the large-scale analyses</p>
<p>of the relationship between depression and caffeine</p>
<p>shows that provided people are not drinking so much caffeine</p>
<p>that it makes them overly anxious,</p>
<p>that regular intake of caffeine</p>
<p>is inversely related to levels of depression,</p>
<p>so it may have some antidepressant effects,</p>
<p>and those could be direct or indirect.</p>
<p>What do I mean by that?</p>
<p>Well, you can imagine that if people are ingesting caffeine</p>
<p>and they are more motivated to do work</p>
<p>and pursue quality social interactions,</p>
<p>then the probability that they will have depression</p>
<p>could be lower.</p>
<p>It could also be that there are direct effects</p>
<p>on the chemical systems of the brain</p>
<p>that relate to mood and well-being</p>
<p>that could offset depression.</p>
<p>It is not clear whether or not the effects of caffeine</p>
<p>in countering depression are direct or indirect.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, there&rsquo;s a relationship there,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s an interesting and positive one,</p>
<p>or I should say negative correlation,</p>
<p>positive effect overall on mood and well-being, to be exact.</p>
<p>Now, it&rsquo;s also the case that caffeine</p>
<p>can improve mental performance and physical performance.</p>
<p>This has been demonstrated in tens of thousands of studies.</p>
<p>I will review a few studies on this in particular today,</p>
<p>but to just give you a sense of how caffeine works</p>
<p>at the level of its timing and impact</p>
<p>on mental performance and physical performance,</p>
<p>when we ingest caffeine,</p>
<p>provided that we don&rsquo;t have a lot of food in our stomach</p>
<p>and that our blood sugar isn&rsquo;t particularly high,</p>
<p>generally, we experience an increase in alertness</p>
<p>within about five minutes,</p>
<p>and that increase in focus and alertness</p>
<p>peaks around 30 minutes after ingestion of caffeine</p>
<p>and persists for as long as 60 minutes.</p>
<p>Now, this is assuming that one takes caffeine in pill form</p>
<p>or drinks the entire caffeine drink</p>
<p>within a short period of time,</p>
<p>but a little bit later,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll talk about how you can consume caffeine</p>
<p>at regular intervals while doing mental work</p>
<p>or physical work in a way</p>
<p>that can further increase mental performance</p>
<p>and physical performance.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s just touch on what caffeine intake</p>
<p>really does for mental performance and physical performance.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most robust finding</p>
<p>across all of the studies that I&rsquo;ve examined</p>
<p>is that caffeine reduces our reaction time.</p>
<p>That is, it improves our reaction time.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t make it longer, it makes it shorter.</p>
<p>So for instance, in a laboratory study</p>
<p>where people were asked to hit a lever</p>
<p>every time they hear a tone,</p>
<p>you can greatly reduce the time</p>
<p>between the tone and the pressing of the lever</p>
<p>if people ingest caffeine about 30 minutes</p>
<p>before they do that task.</p>
<p>Now, that seems like a trivial task,</p>
<p>but this is also seen in the domain of sports performance</p>
<p>and even in cognitive performance</p>
<p>where people have to arrive</p>
<p>at a particular answer to a question.</p>
<p>And the answer to that question</p>
<p>has to be pulled from their memory banks</p>
<p>within their brain, their hippocampus, for instance,</p>
<p>a brain structure involved in memory.</p>
<p>And if you are asking people, for instance,</p>
<p>to remember the capitals of different states or cities</p>
<p>or to remember certain historical facts,</p>
<p>they will do that at a particular rate.</p>
<p>But if they&rsquo;ve ingested caffeine within the hour prior,</p>
<p>their ability to recall that information</p>
<p>is much, much better.</p>
<p>They are faster and it does not appear</p>
<p>that accuracy is reduced.</p>
<p>In fact, in many cases, accuracy is enhanced.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because caffeine both works</p>
<p>on the reaction time systems of the brain and body.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll talk about the mechanisms for that in a little bit,</p>
<p>but it also stimulates certain neurotransmitters</p>
<p>and so-called neuromodulators within the brain and body</p>
<p>that give the neural circuits in the brain</p>
<p>that are associated with learning and memory</p>
<p>a lower threshold to activation.</p>
<p>That means that we are better able to access</p>
<p>the brain circuitry involved in learning and memory</p>
<p>when we have a certain amount of caffeine</p>
<p>circulating in our system.</p>
<p>So this makes caffeine</p>
<p>an incredible performance-enhancing compound.</p>
<p>And I could give you tens of thousands of examples</p>
<p>of this in humans.</p>
<p>But before I do that, I want to just touch on</p>
<p>what we know about the existence of caffeine in nature</p>
<p>and what the existence of caffeine in nature</p>
<p>and its effects on other animals</p>
<p>tells us about what caffeine does in humans.</p>
<p>Because as I alluded to earlier,</p>
<p>what caffeine is doing for us</p>
<p>is not just making us more alert, improving our memory,</p>
<p>improving our reaction time, and so on.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually acting as a powerful reinforcer of experience.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s acting as not just a powerful reinforcer</p>
<p>of the caffeine-containing drink that we drink,</p>
<p>but also the mug that it&rsquo;s contained in,</p>
<p>plus the person that we might be sitting across</p>
<p>from when we consume that caffeine, and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s a little bit hard for you to conceptualize</p>
<p>what a reinforcer is and why I&rsquo;m calling it a reinforcer,</p>
<p>let me spell it out in three specific ways.</p>
<p>We often hear about the word reward and we think,</p>
<p>okay, if we do certain things and we like the outcome,</p>
<p>then those certain things are rewarded, right?</p>
<p>If we&rsquo;re doing something, we receive praise,</p>
<p>the praise is the reward,</p>
<p>and therefore we are more likely</p>
<p>to do that thing in the future.</p>
<p>In fact, a lot of parenting is like that,</p>
<p>and a lot of life is like that.</p>
<p>However, when we hear the word reward,</p>
<p>we often think about something that feels good to us.</p>
<p>And certainly if we&rsquo;ve worked hard and we get some praise,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s natural for the praise to feel good to us.</p>
<p>Or for instance, if we work very hard</p>
<p>and we get a certain outcome, a trophy,</p>
<p>a financial outcome, a degree outcome,</p>
<p>recognition, et cetera, all of those can act as rewards,</p>
<p>but those are all conscious rewards.</p>
<p>We are aware that they are happening.</p>
<p>Reinforcers are a little bit different</p>
<p>because the word reinforcement can apply</p>
<p>to conscious rewards of the sort that I just described,</p>
<p>but there are also many ways in which caffeine</p>
<p>stimulates the release of chemicals in our body</p>
<p>that act as reinforcers,</p>
<p>but those reinforcers are subconscious.</p>
<p>That is, we are not aware that they cause this preference</p>
<p>for the activities that cause their release.</p>
<p>So the study I&rsquo;m about to describe beautifully,</p>
<p>I believe, encapsulates how is it that humans</p>
<p>came to consume caffeine and why caffeine exists in nature</p>
<p>and the powerful effects of caffeine as a reinforcing agent,</p>
<p>both in animals, insects, and in you and me.</p>
<p>And the title of the paper is</p>
<p>Caffeine in Floral Nectar Enhances</p>
<p>a Pollinator&rsquo;s Memory of Reward.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that caffeine is made from plants.</p>
<p>Some of you will say, duh,</p>
<p>but I think some of us don&rsquo;t realize</p>
<p>that the reason why there is caffeine in coffee</p>
<p>is because coffee comes from a plant,</p>
<p>as a coffee bean, certain teas,</p>
<p>which of course are plants that people brew.</p>
<p>Caffeine is contained in those teas, such as yerba mate.</p>
<p>Well, why would this bitter substance,</p>
<p>because in fact,</p>
<p>caffeine is quite bitter in high concentrations,</p>
<p>why would this bitter substance be something that insects</p>
<p>or animals would want to consume at all?</p>
<p>It turns out that in most plants,</p>
<p>caffeine is present in small enough quantities</p>
<p>that insects and other animals,</p>
<p>and in fact, we can&rsquo;t actually taste the caffeine.</p>
<p>If I were to give you a little bit of pure caffeine,</p>
<p>yes, it would be a stimulant for you,</p>
<p>but you would say that it tasted awful.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s in a category of compounds</p>
<p>that would strongly stimulate</p>
<p>the bitter receptors on your tongue,</p>
<p>and would make you cringe and pucker,</p>
<p>and essentially walk away from whatever it is</p>
<p>that contained that caffeine,</p>
<p>and from the experience that contained that caffeine.</p>
<p>Well, in nature,</p>
<p>caffeine is present in very low concentrations,</p>
<p>or is masked by other flavors</p>
<p>within flowers, beans, and plants.</p>
<p>And what this paper really points to</p>
<p>is that caffeine in nature is acting as a reinforcer</p>
<p>for bees that are consuming different nectar.</p>
<p>So the way that it works is that bees, of course,</p>
<p>go from flower to flower,</p>
<p>and they are consuming the nectar.</p>
<p>They are bringing nectar and pollen back to the hive,</p>
<p>and that provides critical nourishment for the bee colony.</p>
<p>The bees are foraging in a way</p>
<p>that includes information about color,</p>
<p>in particular, ultraviolet color,</p>
<p>things that we can&rsquo;t see, but they can see,</p>
<p>because they have different photoreceptors than we do.</p>
<p>And what this study shows is that plants and nectars</p>
<p>that contain very small amounts of caffeine</p>
<p>are the preferred sources of food for bees.</p>
<p>And the study is beautiful</p>
<p>because they were able to confirm</p>
<p>that they could mask the caffeine taste,</p>
<p>so if they know that the bees</p>
<p>are not preferring the taste of caffeine,</p>
<p>but what they do is they pair caffeine</p>
<p>with different food sources for the bees,</p>
<p>then they remove the caffeine.</p>
<p>And what they find is that the bees</p>
<p>very strongly prefer flavors that contain caffeine,</p>
<p>not because they could taste the caffeine,</p>
<p>but rather for the way that those caffeine-containing</p>
<p>flavors made the bees feel.</p>
<p>So how do those caffeine-containing flavors</p>
<p>make the bees feel?</p>
<p>The same way that they make you and I feel,</p>
<p>a little bit more alert,</p>
<p>and thereby able to do more work.</p>
<p>For the bee, the more work is the consumption of more food,</p>
<p>which then has a further reinforcing effect.</p>
<p>So what we&rsquo;re really talking about here</p>
<p>is the fact that, A, caffeine exists in nature, in plants.</p>
<p>It exists in concentrations that are very low,</p>
<p>so low, in fact, that they are not detectable</p>
<p>to the taste receptors of insects,</p>
<p>and in many cases to the taste receptors of humans.</p>
<p>And of course, there can be high levels of caffeine</p>
<p>in a plant, but if the plant also contains compounds</p>
<p>that mask the flavor of caffeine,</p>
<p>well, then those plants are going to essentially</p>
<p>be even stronger reinforcers for the flavor of the plant.</p>
<p>Okay, so now we&rsquo;re talking about strong flavors</p>
<p>plus strong neurostimulant effects of caffeine.</p>
<p>And the most important point here</p>
<p>is that all of these effects of caffeine are subconscious.</p>
<p>It is not because the bee or you likes the taste of caffeine.</p>
<p>In fact, most people,</p>
<p>when they take their first sip of coffee,</p>
<p>they find that it tastes bitter and kind of noxious.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t like it.</p>
<p>You may not even remember that</p>
<p>because it happened so long ago,</p>
<p>and because caffeine is such a strong reinforcer</p>
<p>that very quickly you come to like the taste of coffee.</p>
<p>You might even come to like the feeling</p>
<p>of your mug in your hand.</p>
<p>You might even come to like the smell of coffee,</p>
<p>and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because caffeine stimulates the release</p>
<p>of certain neurochemicals in the brain,</p>
<p>in particular, dopamine and acetylcholine,</p>
<p>two neuromodulators that increase our focus and alertness</p>
<p>in our feelings of wellbeing.</p>
<p>A little bit later, I&rsquo;ll tell you</p>
<p>that caffeine stimulates the release of dopamine</p>
<p>in a way that&rsquo;s very much distinct</p>
<p>from the classical dopamine pathway</p>
<p>associated with addiction and reward.</p>
<p>In fact, we can think of caffeine</p>
<p>as having a somewhat privileged access</p>
<p>to the reward systems.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give you a bit of a hint of where this is going.</p>
<p>Caffeine stimulates the release of dopamine</p>
<p>and acetylcholine, not within the classic</p>
<p>so-called mesolimbic reward pathway.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just fancy nerd speak</p>
<p>for the reward pathways of the brain.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re associated with things like sex and food</p>
<p>and drugs of abuse like cocaine and methamphetamine,</p>
<p>but rather caffeine seems to stimulate</p>
<p>the release of dopamine in the parts of the brain</p>
<p>that are associated with alertness and cognition,</p>
<p>meaning the forebrain.</p>
<p>This is very important.</p>
<p>We have multiple dopamine systems in the brain and body,</p>
<p>and caffeine seems to stimulate dopamine directly</p>
<p>within the components of the brain</p>
<p>that are associated with clarity of thought and wellbeing,</p>
<p>but more so clarity of thought.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;m also talking about caffeine as a strong reinforcer</p>
<p>in that it makes you feel good overall, and it does,</p>
<p>and that suggests that it also taps</p>
<p>into the more classic reward pathway,</p>
<p>but it does that in a very interesting</p>
<p>and frankly, almost diabolical way.</p>
<p>When we regularly ingest caffeine,</p>
<p>it stimulates the increase in dopamine receptors</p>
<p>at multiple sites throughout the brain,</p>
<p>but in particular within the reward pathways of the brain.</p>
<p>So not the areas of the brain that are associated</p>
<p>with focus and clarity of thought and cognition.</p>
<p>It does that, but it is also increasing the level</p>
<p>of dopamine receptors in the reward pathway.</p>
<p>And what that means is that for any dopamine</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s released in response to a positive experience,</p>
<p>social experience, or any number of the other things</p>
<p>that can stimulate dopamine release,</p>
<p>there are more receptors, more parking spots, if you will,</p>
<p>for that dopamine to arrive at and to exert</p>
<p>its increases in mood, increases in motivation,</p>
<p>and overall feelings of drive and excitement.</p>
<p>So there are four ways that caffeine works</p>
<p>that we need to understand.</p>
<p>First of all, caffeine acts as a reinforcing agent.</p>
<p>It increases the probability that you will return to</p>
<p>and engage in a certain activity</p>
<p>or consume a certain beverage or food.</p>
<p>Second of all, caffeine increases dopamine and acetylcholine</p>
<p>which are both neuromodulators in the forebrain,</p>
<p>which helps us improve our ability to think,</p>
<p>to modify our rule sets, that is to adjust our strategies</p>
<p>for different social situations and mental demands</p>
<p>and physical demands.</p>
<p>And third, it increases the number and efficacy</p>
<p>of dopamine receptors in the reward pathways of the brain.</p>
<p>That is, it makes things that would feel pretty good</p>
<p>feel even better.</p>
<p>And fourth, caffeine acts as an antagonist to adenosine,</p>
<p>which offsets the sleepiness that we would otherwise feel</p>
<p>from the accumulation of adenosine that occurs</p>
<p>as we are awake for more and more hours throughout the day.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk first about caffeine as a reinforcing agent.</p>
<p>Again, this was first most beautifully demonstrated</p>
<p>in this study on honeybees where the bees prefer nectars</p>
<p>that contain caffeine.</p>
<p>And that all makes perfect sense in terms of the ecology</p>
<p>of bees and flowers that contain nectar.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an advantage, at least in terms of adaptation,</p>
<p>that the flower benefits because of distribution</p>
<p>of things from the flower, which is good for the flowers</p>
<p>and the bees benefit because they&rsquo;re getting food.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s a kind of a symbiosis there.</p>
<p>But with humans, we&rsquo;re consuming caffeine-containing</p>
<p>beverages for our sake.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think we have it in mind,</p>
<p>nor do the bees have it in mind, frankly,</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re trying to preserve the plants</p>
<p>that provide the caffeine.</p>
<p>I think we would all suffer, or I should say 90% of adults</p>
<p>would suffer greatly if all the caffeine-containing</p>
<p>coffee and tea plants were gone, certainly.</p>
<p>But most of us are not consuming coffees and teas</p>
<p>and caffeine-containing foods because we&rsquo;re thinking</p>
<p>about the plants they come from</p>
<p>and we want to help those plants.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re thinking about how we want to help ourselves.</p>
<p>And yet the point of the reinforcing effects of caffeine</p>
<p>are that they are largely subconscious.</p>
<p>We are not aware of them.</p>
<p>Now you might say, no, that&rsquo;s not true.</p>
<p>When I drink caffeine, it makes me feel really good.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m aware that it makes me feel good.</p>
<p>In order to illustrate how reinforcement really works,</p>
<p>let me give you the counter example,</p>
<p>which would be an aversive agent.</p>
<p>So we have reinforcing agents and we have aversive agents.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say that there were compounds in nature</p>
<p>that exist in plants that are aversive.</p>
<p>And indeed they are.</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s say that these compounds were present</p>
<p>at such low concentrations that you couldn&rsquo;t taste them.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say you wake up in the morning</p>
<p>and you go to your refrigerator and you open it up</p>
<p>and you are thirsty.</p>
<p>And so you reach for a nice, you know,</p>
<p>rich red containing beverage in a glass jar.</p>
<p>Maybe it looks like cranberry juice</p>
<p>or something of that sort,</p>
<p>or even a nice clear glass of water.</p>
<p>It looks like a jug of water, a glass of water,</p>
<p>and you drink that.</p>
<p>Tastes fine to you.</p>
<p>Maybe even tastes great to you.</p>
<p>And then let&rsquo;s say about 30 minutes later,</p>
<p>you feel a little queasy.</p>
<p>You feel a little off.</p>
<p>You feel like going back to sleep.</p>
<p>You just don&rsquo;t feel very good.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t know why,</p>
<p>but your nervous system is a predictive machine.</p>
<p>And it has a process in which it back integrates,</p>
<p>or I should say integrates backwards</p>
<p>into your immediate experience</p>
<p>that preceded that not so good feeling.</p>
<p>We can reliably say that there is a much lower probability</p>
<p>that the next day when you wake up</p>
<p>that you would reach for that same beverage</p>
<p>or for that same container even.</p>
<p>And maybe if you&rsquo;re in a novel environment,</p>
<p>maybe you&rsquo;re staying in an Airbnb or a hotel</p>
<p>or something of that sort,</p>
<p>you might even find that you don&rsquo;t really like the kitchen</p>
<p>in which you consume that beverage in the first place.</p>
<p>Now, you don&rsquo;t know why.</p>
<p>And unless you got very, very sick the day before,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s unlikely that you would have such a strong response</p>
<p>that you would entirely avoid, for instance,</p>
<p>water or glass jars containing liquids, et cetera.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s say you went back to the refrigerator</p>
<p>and you consumed beverage again,</p>
<p>and you just didn&rsquo;t feel so well.</p>
<p>You felt less good than you normally would.</p>
<p>Well, even without any ability to taste</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s in that beverage,</p>
<p>and even without any understanding</p>
<p>of what was happening to you at a conscious level,</p>
<p>there is a very, very high probability</p>
<p>that you will avoid drinking that particular beverage,</p>
<p>and certainly at that location</p>
<p>and in the same volume in the subsequent days.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just the way that aversive agents work.</p>
<p>And they work by way of activating neurons in the gut</p>
<p>that communicate with areas in the brain</p>
<p>that give us this feeling of queasiness.</p>
<p>And for some of you hearing this,</p>
<p>that pathway and that association</p>
<p>with times in which you felt queasy</p>
<p>and as if you wanted to vomit is so powerful</p>
<p>that you might even be feeling</p>
<p>some of that symptomology now.</p>
<p>For certain people, that&rsquo;s going to be increased salivation,</p>
<p>which precedes vomiting.</p>
<p>We know that there&rsquo;s a class of neurons in the brain</p>
<p>related to an area called area post-tremor</p>
<p>that actually stimulates vomiting.</p>
<p>And if I keep talking about this,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll probably feel like I want to vomit.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m going to move on from this in a moment.</p>
<p>So when we ingest caffeine containing beverages and foods,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the exact opposite scenarios to what I just described.</p>
<p>Caffeine as a reinforcer makes us feel slightly better</p>
<p>or a lot better in the immediate minutes</p>
<p>and hours after we ingest it.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s acting as a reinforcing agent,</p>
<p>not just while you&rsquo;re under the effects of caffeine,</p>
<p>but for the things that preceded</p>
<p>the ingestion of caffeine,</p>
<p>which is why you return again and again</p>
<p>to caffeine containing beverages,</p>
<p>such as coffee and tea,</p>
<p>or maybe even foods that contain caffeine,</p>
<p>even if the taste of those foods is not something</p>
<p>that you would otherwise consider especially delicious.</p>
<p>In fact, most people,</p>
<p>when they take their first sip of coffee or tea</p>
<p>or other caffeine containing beverage,</p>
<p>they find it to be very bitter.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not because of the taste of caffeine,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s because of the taste of the beverage itself,</p>
<p>independent of caffeine.</p>
<p>However, when caffeine is present in there,</p>
<p>they come to prefer that taste over most all tastes.</p>
<p>In fact, they will, as I mentioned earlier,</p>
<p>will invest a lot of financial resources</p>
<p>and time and energy to make sure</p>
<p>that they get that beverage.</p>
<p>What they&rsquo;re trying to make sure</p>
<p>is not that they get that taste,</p>
<p>but that they get the caffeine.</p>
<p>It is that positively reinforcing.</p>
<p>And the taste therefore takes on new significance,</p>
<p>new meaning, and we come to associate it as positive.</p>
<p>And in fact, most of us, including myself,</p>
<p>love the taste of espresso, love the taste of coffee,</p>
<p>love the taste of yerba mate,</p>
<p>even if the initial taste,</p>
<p>the very first time that we consumed that beverage</p>
<p>was either neutral or negative.</p>
<p>And that is all because of the reinforcing properties</p>
<p>of caffeine.</p>
<p>And then of course,</p>
<p>there are the more direct actions of caffeine,</p>
<p>that is the faster actions of caffeine.</p>
<p>And just to list those off again, very briefly,</p>
<p>so that you have them in mind going forward,</p>
<p>caffeine also increases the release of dopamine</p>
<p>and acetylcholine,</p>
<p>both of which are neuromodulators in the forebrain,</p>
<p>which increases clarity of thought</p>
<p>and your ability to rule switch,</p>
<p>your ability to move from one context to another</p>
<p>and change and understand the rules of engagement,</p>
<p>social engagement, physical engagement,</p>
<p>mental engagement, and so forth.</p>
<p>And as I mentioned before,</p>
<p>caffeine also increases the number of dopamine receptors</p>
<p>in the reward pathway,</p>
<p>such that any good thing that happens to you,</p>
<p>any positive experience that you have</p>
<p>will have a more potent effect</p>
<p>on your feelings of wellbeing.</p>
<p>And last but certainly not least,</p>
<p>caffeine acts as an adenosine antagonist.</p>
<p>It reduces your feelings of lethargy and fatigue</p>
<p>and your desire to sleep</p>
<p>by parking in the receptors for adenosine</p>
<p>and not allowing adenosine to have its pro-sleepy,</p>
<p>if you will, effects on your brain and body.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to take a quick break</p>
<p>and acknowledge one of our sponsors, Athletic Greens.</p>
<p>Athletic Greens, now called AG1,</p>
<p>is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink</p>
<p>that covers all of your foundational nutritional needs.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been taking Athletic Greens since 2012,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m delighted that they&rsquo;re sponsoring the podcast.</p>
<p>The reason I started taking Athletic Greens</p>
<p>and the reason I still take Athletic Greens</p>
<p>once or usually twice a day</p>
<p>is that it gets me the probiotics that I need for gut health.</p>
<p>Our gut is very important.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s populated by gut microbiota</p>
<p>that communicate with the brain, the immune system,</p>
<p>and basically all the biological systems of our body</p>
<p>to strongly impact our immediate and long-term health.</p>
<p>And those probiotics in Athletic Greens</p>
<p>are optimal and vital for microbiotic health.</p>
<p>In addition, Athletic Greens contains a number of adaptogens,</p>
<p>vitamins, and minerals that make sure</p>
<p>that all of my foundational nutritional needs are met,</p>
<p>and it tastes great.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Athletic Greens,</p>

<p>Again, that&rsquo;s athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>to get the five free travel packs</p>
<p>and the year&rsquo;s supply of vitamin D3K2.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to just briefly talk about adenosine</p>
<p>and some of its molecular features.</p>
<p>And again, if you don&rsquo;t have a background in biology,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t worry, I promise to make this very clear to everyone.</p>
<p>First of all, caffeine is what&rsquo;s called a methylxanthine.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a plant alkaloid.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why caffeine itself is very bitter.</p>
<p>Again, if I were to give you</p>
<p>just the tiniest little bit of pure caffeine,</p>
<p>you would find it to be extremely aversive.</p>
<p>And so these plants that have snuck</p>
<p>small enough amounts of caffeine into them,</p>
<p>or that have masked the flavor of caffeine</p>
<p>with other flavors such that bees and humans</p>
<p>want to consume them,</p>
<p>while we don&rsquo;t know what plants think,</p>
<p>it does seem very diabolical and very clever</p>
<p>in that we are seeking out these caffeine-containing</p>
<p>plants, beverages, and foods,</p>
<p>even though caffeine itself is this alkaloid</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s very, very bitter.</p>
<p>Methylxanthine, that is caffeine,</p>
<p>binds to adenosine receptors,</p>
<p>and there are really two types of adenosine receptors.</p>
<p>There are these so-called A1 receptors</p>
<p>and the A2 receptors,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re present in different parts of the brain and body</p>
<p>at different levels.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have to get too far into receptor subtypes.</p>
<p>More importantly to understand</p>
<p>is that adenosine makes us feel tired</p>
<p>because of the way that it taps into the ATP pathway.</p>
<p>The ATP pathway is central to energy production</p>
<p>and feelings of overall energy in our brain and body</p>
<p>in all cells and organ systems.</p>
<p>When caffeine binds to adenosine receptors,</p>
<p>it prevents adenosine from breaking down</p>
<p>certain components of the energy production pathway.</p>
<p>And the net consequence of that is increased cyclic AMP.</p>
<p>So basically, when we ingest caffeine,</p>
<p>we are biasing our system towards the pro-energetic aspects</p>
<p>of these cellular pathways.</p>
<p>Now, it&rsquo;s really important to understand that in biology,</p>
<p>even if you block a receptor</p>
<p>or you prevent the activity of an enzyme,</p>
<p>and at least in this case,</p>
<p>you end up with more cyclic AMP, more energy,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not really getting more energy.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re actually borrowing energy against an overall system</p>
<p>that is frankly non-negotiable.</p>
<p>What do I mean by that?</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s say that you were to wake up</p>
<p>after six or eight hours of sleep</p>
<p>and to drink a lot of caffeine</p>
<p>and keep drinking caffeine throughout the day,</p>
<p>throughout the day, blocking those adenosine receptors.</p>
<p>Yes, you&rsquo;ll offset fatigue.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll offset sleepiness</p>
<p>because that adenosine simply can&rsquo;t function.</p>
<p>But at the point where the caffeine becomes dislodged</p>
<p>from the adenosine receptors,</p>
<p>you will have a massive glut, a backlog of adenosine,</p>
<p>and you will feel extra, extra sleepy.</p>
<p>So really there&rsquo;s no way to create more energy</p>
<p>in your system.</p>
<p>Really what you&rsquo;re doing is you&rsquo;re changing the timing</p>
<p>in which the sleepy signals</p>
<p>and the more energetic signals are arriving.</p>
<p>And this is really important to understand as the backdrop</p>
<p>to the various tools that we&rsquo;re going to get into next,</p>
<p>in which you can use caffeine</p>
<p>for enhancing mental performance and physical performance</p>
<p>and other aspects of health.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s very important to understand this concept</p>
<p>that when you wake up in the morning,</p>
<p>provided that you slept well and enough the night before,</p>
<p>your levels of adenosine will be about as low</p>
<p>as they will ever be.</p>
<p>Actually, in order to get your adenosine levels</p>
<p>really bottomed out,</p>
<p>you want to avoid caffeine</p>
<p>in the first 90 to 120 minutes after waking.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll talk about why that is because it turns out</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a way to completely clear adenosine</p>
<p>out of your system in the hour or so after waking.</p>
<p>But for most people,</p>
<p>adenosine levels are going to be close to their lowest</p>
<p>after a good night&rsquo;s sleep.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s really no negotiating the accumulation</p>
<p>of adenosine that&rsquo;s going to occur</p>
<p>and going to bias you towards feeling more sleepy</p>
<p>than you would otherwise</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to occur throughout the day.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s really no way to eliminate adenosine.</p>
<p>All you can really do is block its function.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s sort of like borrowing energy</p>
<p>against the fatigue that you will inevitably feel.</p>
<p>Now, this actually has</p>
<p>a very important socioeconomical relevance.</p>
<p>Before caffeine was regularly consumed by human beings,</p>
<p>we were really slaves to the light-dark cycle.</p>
<p>And this was especially true</p>
<p>before the presence of artificial lighting.</p>
<p>But even before the advent of artificial lighting,</p>
<p>humans were largely constrained</p>
<p>to the outside light-dark cycle.</p>
<p>We need to be active during the day</p>
<p>and working during the day,</p>
<p>and we need to be asleep at night.</p>
<p>Caffeine allows us to divorce ourselves</p>
<p>from that circadian cycle.</p>
<p>Circadian just means about 24 hour.</p>
<p>Caffeine allows us to do that at least somewhat</p>
<p>by way of increasing our alertness,</p>
<p>that is spiking our alertness</p>
<p>at various times throughout the day and even at night.</p>
<p>This is how we can have shift workers, for instance,</p>
<p>that can sleep during the day</p>
<p>and then drink a strong cup of coffee at 8 p.m.</p>
<p>and then work into the night.</p>
<p>That ability completely transformed our society.</p>
<p>Now, of course, the healthiest schedule,</p>
<p>we know this with certainty,</p>
<p>the healthiest schedule for brain and body</p>
<p>is going to be to be alert during the daytime</p>
<p>and asleep at night.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no question about that.</p>
<p>Shift workers run into all sorts of health problems.</p>
<p>And thank you, shift workers,</p>
<p>for doing the important work that you do.</p>
<p>We need you, air traffic controllers, paramedics,</p>
<p>firefighters, police officers, et cetera.</p>
<p>But we know that there are serious health consequences,</p>
<p>negative health consequences, that is, for shift workers.</p>
<p>But for most people out there,</p>
<p>about 95% of people follow a typical schedule</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re awake during the day and asleep at night.</p>
<p>And yet it used to be</p>
<p>before the advent of caffeine-containing beverages</p>
<p>that if you were sleepy in the afternoon,</p>
<p>you either had to take a nap or battle that sleepiness.</p>
<p>That your activity rhythms and your sleep rhythms</p>
<p>were governed by these circadian changes</p>
<p>in availability of sunlight and when you slept.</p>
<p>And you just didn&rsquo;t have the ability to ingest a beverage</p>
<p>that would increase your levels of alertness</p>
<p>because you block adenosine.</p>
<p>So this is important to understand that nowadays,</p>
<p>we certainly live in a time</p>
<p>in which we use, in fact, 90% or more of adults</p>
<p>and half or more of adolescents and teenagers</p>
<p>use caffeine as a way to negotiate with,</p>
<p>to borrow against this natural pattern of adenosine</p>
<p>making us sleepy.</p>
<p>But again, you&rsquo;re just offsetting the effects</p>
<p>of sleepiness that adenosine causes.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t eliminate the adenosine entirely.</p>
<p>The important point is that adenosine</p>
<p>as a pro-sleepy molecule</p>
<p>is a non-negotiable aspect of your biology.</p>
<p>In fact, it&rsquo;s so non-negotiable that every 24 hours</p>
<p>you are going to release adenosine</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re going to release adenosine</p>
<p>in direct proportion to how long you&rsquo;ve been awake.</p>
<p>So the longer you&rsquo;ve been awake,</p>
<p>the more adenosine circulating in your system.</p>
<p>There are really only a handful of ways</p>
<p>to completely clear out adenosine.</p>
<p>The major one being to get sleep.</p>
<p>The other is to take a short nap, which of course is sleep,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s shallow sleep or non-sleep deep rest,</p>
<p>so-called NSDR has been shown to reduce levels</p>
<p>of adenosine.</p>
<p>And there are certain things such as</p>
<p>viewing morning sunlight,</p>
<p>which because of its effects on cortisol</p>
<p>can quote unquote clear out adenosine.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll talk about this in more detail in a few minutes.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s also evidence that certain forms of exercise</p>
<p>provided that it&rsquo;s brief and intense</p>
<p>can also reduce adenosine, not just block its effects.</p>
<p>Now that we&rsquo;ve talked about some of the incredible mechanisms</p>
<p>by which caffeine changes our experience of life,</p>
<p>increases alertness and mood, et cetera,</p>
<p>I want to talk about the use of caffeine as a tool.</p>
<p>Now, caffeine is a very potent and useful tool</p>
<p>for enhancing mental health,</p>
<p>physical health and performance,</p>
<p>but there are certain considerations</p>
<p>one has to keep in mind, in particular dose.</p>
<p>Now, first off, not everybody will respond</p>
<p>to the same dose of caffeine the same way,</p>
<p>but we can reliably say that your body weight</p>
<p>is a good measure by which you can estimate</p>
<p>what a healthy, useful dose of caffeine would be.</p>
<p>So for most people,</p>
<p>ingesting one to three milligrams of caffeine</p>
<p>per kilogram of body weight</p>
<p>is going to be the range in which</p>
<p>caffeine can have positive effects</p>
<p>without making us feel overly anxious</p>
<p>and give us that feeling that</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re jumping out of our skin</p>
<p>and turn the otherwise positive experience of caffeine</p>
<p>into an aversive one.</p>
<p>For those of you that aren&rsquo;t familiar</p>
<p>with thinking in terms of kilograms</p>
<p>and normally thinking pounds,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just quickly give you some general estimations</p>
<p>that for instance, 100 kilograms equals 220 pounds.</p>
<p>So for me, I weigh 100 kilograms.</p>
<p>That means that one to three milligrams,</p>
<p>again, milligrams, thousandths of a gram,</p>
<p>one to three milligrams of caffeine</p>
<p>per kilogram of body weight would mean for me,</p>
<p>I could safely ingest 100 to 300 milligrams of caffeine</p>
<p>in a single dose, in a single drink,</p>
<p>if that&rsquo;s the way I&rsquo;m consuming it,</p>
<p>or pill form if that&rsquo;s the way that I&rsquo;m consuming it.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s very likely that that will be a tolerable dose.</p>
<p>However, if you are not somebody</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s accustomed to drinking caffeine on a regular basis,</p>
<p>I suggest you start on the lower end</p>
<p>of that one to three milligrams per kilogram</p>
<p>of body weight range.</p>
<p>So for instance, if you&rsquo;re somebody who weighs 50 kilograms,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s approximately 110 pounds,</p>
<p>and you would be pretty comfortable ingesting somewhere</p>
<p>between 50 and 150 milligrams of caffeine.</p>
<p>So what I recommend is that people</p>
<p>who are considering using caffeine as a tool,</p>
<p>or who are already ingesting caffeine,</p>
<p>start to think about the dosage of caffeine</p>
<p>that you are ingesting or plan to ingest,</p>
<p>and the timing in which you ingest that caffeine</p>
<p>relative to certain tasks throughout your day,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re waking and you&rsquo;re sleeping.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll talk about that in just a moment.</p>
<p>But the first step for you is to figure out</p>
<p>how much you weigh in kilograms,</p>
<p>and then to go to that number of one to three milligrams</p>
<p>of caffeine per kilogram of body weight.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a good range in which you might want</p>
<p>to explore the use of caffeine in a single application,</p>
<p>meaning a single dose.</p>
<p>Now, I do realize that some people out there</p>
<p>are drinking coffee all day long</p>
<p>or having coffee in the morning,</p>
<p>and then again in the afternoon.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m referring to here is the ingestion of caffeine</p>
<p>in a single bout, right?</p>
<p>One cup of coffee or two cups of coffee, for instance,</p>
<p>to achieve that 100 to 300 milligram range,</p>
<p>if that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s appropriate for your body weight.</p>
<p>But to avoid any confusion,</p>
<p>when I talk about dosage of caffeine,</p>
<p>what I&rsquo;m really talking about</p>
<p>is not the total amount of caffeine ingested per day.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking about the total amount of caffeine</p>
<p>ingested in one sitting or setting, that is.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re somebody who&rsquo;s drinking caffeine</p>
<p>multiple times throughout the day,</p>
<p>you could imagine, for instance,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say the appropriate dose for you</p>
<p>in order to get an enhancement in mental performance</p>
<p>or physical performance is 200 milligrams,</p>
<p>and you are somebody who&rsquo;s doing some work in the morning</p>
<p>and you want to have that lift in the morning</p>
<p>to be able to focus better,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re doing some physical exercise in the afternoon</p>
<p>or vice versa, that you would ingest 200 milligrams</p>
<p>of caffeine at two separate times per day,</p>
<p>separated by about four hours.</p>
<p>Now, you don&rsquo;t have to separate them.</p>
<p>You could put them two hours apart, for instance,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;ll talk about half-life of caffeine and so forth.</p>
<p>Just keep in mind that if you&rsquo;re ingesting</p>
<p>200 milligrams of caffeine</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s the appropriate dose for you</p>
<p>based on your body weight,</p>
<p>and then you are ingesting</p>
<p>another 200 milligrams of caffeine an hour later,</p>
<p>you are effectively ingesting</p>
<p>approximately 400 milligrams of caffeine,</p>
<p>which is going to start exceeding the dose</p>
<p>in which you can normally tolerate</p>
<p>without feeling anxious and jittery.</p>
<p>With all of that said,</p>
<p>there is a range of tolerance for caffeine</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s based on two things.</p>
<p>One is a preexisting disposition,</p>
<p>that is whether or not your genetics and nervous system</p>
<p>and the backdrop of your life,</p>
<p>how much stress you&rsquo;re experiencing,</p>
<p>tends to make you feel more anxious and alert and jittery</p>
<p>before you ingest any caffeine.</p>
<p>And the other is how so-called caffeine adapted you are.</p>
<p>We often hear about tolerance.</p>
<p>Tolerance means something very specific.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the ability to ingest more and more of something</p>
<p>with a plateau that is a no increase</p>
<p>or an actual reduction in the effectiveness of that thing.</p>
<p>But here we&rsquo;re not really talking</p>
<p>about tolerance to caffeine.</p>
<p>What we&rsquo;re talking about is being caffeine adapted.</p>
<p>A simple way to understand</p>
<p>whether or not you&rsquo;re caffeine adapted or not</p>
<p>is that if you drink caffeine</p>
<p>and it tends to increase your heart rate</p>
<p>and make you feel more alert and a bit more anxious,</p>
<p>then chances are you are not caffeine adapted,</p>
<p>provided the amount of caffeine</p>
<p>is within the healthy range for you, that is,</p>
<p>the ranges we talked about a moment ago.</p>
<p>However, if you&rsquo;re somebody who drinks caffeine</p>
<p>and you actually feel alert and relaxed,</p>
<p>chances are you are caffeine adapted.</p>
<p>At various times during today&rsquo;s episode,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll talk about people who are caffeine adapted</p>
<p>and people who are not caffeine adapted.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll talk about the use of caffeine every other day.</p>
<p>I know a few habitual caffeine drinkers, including myself,</p>
<p>just the simple mention of that probably sounds aversive,</p>
<p>but there is actually great utility</p>
<p>to using caffeine every other day as opposed to every day.</p>
<p>But just keep in mind that some people will drink caffeine</p>
<p>and not get much of a lift from it at all.</p>
<p>Other people will drink caffeine</p>
<p>and they will feel extremely anxious,</p>
<p>even at dosages far lower than that one to three milligrams</p>
<p>per kilogram of body weight range</p>
<p>that I described a moment ago.</p>
<p>So you have to take into account individual differences.</p>
<p>That said, one to three milligrams of caffeine</p>
<p>per kilogram of body weight for a given sitting,</p>
<p>you know, for your morning coffee</p>
<p>or your morning yerba mate tea,</p>
<p>is a good range from which to start.</p>
<p>And I do encourage you to go online</p>
<p>and look up the various beverages and foods</p>
<p>that you might be eating that contain caffeine</p>
<p>For instance, some people are surprised to discover</p>
<p>that the coffee that they get</p>
<p>from some of the more standard popular vendors out there,</p>
<p>the small coffee or the medium coffee, for instance,</p>
<p>can contain as much as 400 to 600 milligrams of caffeine.</p>
<p>And that the large coffee that is often sold</p>
<p>at those commercial vendors can contain</p>
<p>as much as one gram, 1,000 milligrams of caffeine.</p>
<p>Now, you may be adapted to that</p>
<p>such that it doesn&rsquo;t make you feel anxious,</p>
<p>but if you wonder why you feel irritable</p>
<p>and you get a headache when you don&rsquo;t get that caffeine</p>
<p>or that amount of caffeine at precisely the time</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re used to getting it each day,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s because you are consuming quite large quantities</p>
<p>of caffeine on a regular basis.</p>
<p>So I do recommend whether or not you drink soda</p>
<p>or coffee or tea, that you figure out the source of that.</p>
<p>Okay, so figure out what vendor you purchase it from,</p>
<p>what kind of coffee, and go online</p>
<p>and spend a little bit of time</p>
<p>because the information is out there</p>
<p>to discover what levels of caffeine you&rsquo;re actually ingesting.</p>
<p>Now, if you happen to be ingesting</p>
<p>more than one to three milligrams per kilogram</p>
<p>of body weight of caffeine, that&rsquo;s not necessarily bad.</p>
<p>However, you do want to be careful</p>
<p>about ingesting very high levels of caffeine</p>
<p>over long periods of time in your life</p>
<p>because there can be issues that start to arise,</p>
<p>in particular, a bias towards higher levels of anxiety</p>
<p>and depletion of certain electrolytes</p>
<p>because caffeine is a diuretic,</p>
<p>can cause you to lose sodium</p>
<p>and other things of that sort.</p>
<p>And also just from simply a dependent standpoint,</p>
<p>it does appear that if you ingest high levels of caffeine,</p>
<p>that is exceeding the dosages</p>
<p>that normally you could get away with</p>
<p>and get just as much mental enhancing</p>
<p>and physical enhancing benefits,</p>
<p>that you can cause some disruption to the microvasculature,</p>
<p>you can bias yourself towards headaches, anxiety attacks,</p>
<p>and you can become actually quite irritable</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re not getting those higher levels of caffeine.</p>
<p>So I do encourage you to figure out</p>
<p>not just what an appropriate caffeine dosage</p>
<p>would be for you,</p>
<p>but also how much caffeine you might already be ingesting.</p>
<p>The first tool I&rsquo;d like to talk about</p>
<p>is one that I&rsquo;ve mentioned before</p>
<p>on this podcast several times.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s something that if you haven&rsquo;t heard of,</p>
<p>will be very useful to you.</p>
<p>And if you have heard this tool before,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to add some additional features</p>
<p>to the description of this tool</p>
<p>that should make this worthwhile for you as well.</p>
<p>And that is to delay your caffeine intake</p>
<p>to 90 to 120 minutes after waking up on most days.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll be very clear as to days</p>
<p>in which you might want to ingest caffeine</p>
<p>more closely to when you wake up.</p>
<p>Why would you want to delay your caffeine intake</p>
<p>to 90 to 120 minutes after waking?</p>
<p>The answer to that is very simple.</p>
<p>Many people wake up in the morning,</p>
<p>they drink caffeine within 10, 20, 30,</p>
<p>sometimes within two minutes of waking,</p>
<p>and they feel more alert.</p>
<p>Naturally, that makes sense</p>
<p>because of the effects of caffeine</p>
<p>in blocking the effects of adenosine</p>
<p>that I talked about earlier,</p>
<p>and its effects on other neurotransmitter systems.</p>
<p>But then what they find is that in the early afternoon,</p>
<p>in particular after lunch,</p>
<p>they experience a dramatic dip</p>
<p>in their overall levels of energy,</p>
<p>the so-called afternoon crash.</p>
<p>And in most cases, the way they respond to that</p>
<p>is to ingest more caffeine,</p>
<p>which indeed can increase their levels</p>
<p>of mood and alertness.</p>
<p>However, as we&rsquo;ll soon talk about,</p>
<p>there is a problem with ingesting caffeine</p>
<p>in the afternoon.</p>
<p>If it falls within eight or 10,</p>
<p>or dare I even say 12 hours of going to sleep,</p>
<p>and that is the caffeine ingested in the afternoon</p>
<p>for most everybody,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say for 95 plus percent of people,</p>
<p>disrupts the architecture and quality</p>
<p>of their nighttime sleep.</p>
<p>And I should say that it doesn&rsquo;t necessarily</p>
<p>impact their ability to fall asleep,</p>
<p>and maybe even sleep through the night,</p>
<p>but that the depth and quality of that sleep</p>
<p>is disrupted by consuming caffeine in the afternoon.</p>
<p>A little bit later, I&rsquo;ll talk about</p>
<p>how you can offset some of those negative effects</p>
<p>if you absolutely require caffeine in the afternoon.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a huge advantage</p>
<p>to restricting your caffeine intake</p>
<p>to the early part of your day,</p>
<p>but not consuming caffeine</p>
<p>within the first 90 to 120 minutes after waking.</p>
<p>In fact, many people find that</p>
<p>if they delay their caffeine intake</p>
<p>to 90 to 120 minutes after waking up,</p>
<p>that they feel more alert in the morning,</p>
<p>and they completely avoid that afternoon crash.</p>
<p>Now that said, many people, including myself,</p>
<p>do need a short nap, or non-sleep deep rest,</p>
<p>or other form of relaxation</p>
<p>for 10 to 30 minutes in the afternoon.</p>
<p>That is natural and healthy.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not referring to the need for that</p>
<p>when I refer to the so-called afternoon crash.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m talking about in the afternoon crash</p>
<p>is a inability to recover energy and focus,</p>
<p>and a need to consume more caffeine</p>
<p>just to make it through the afternoon.</p>
<p>By delaying caffeine intake to 90 to 120 minutes</p>
<p>after waking, there are a couple of things</p>
<p>that are accomplished.</p>
<p>First of all, you offset that afternoon crash,</p>
<p>and this is an effect that many people experience</p>
<p>the very first time they start delaying their caffeine</p>
<p>intake to 90 to 120 minutes after waking.</p>
<p>And the reason this works so well is the following.</p>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, adenosine is a molecule</p>
<p>that builds up the longer that we are awake.</p>
<p>It is a molecule that is reduced</p>
<p>or cleared from our system by sleep.</p>
<p>So when we emerge from sleep,</p>
<p>regardless of how long we&rsquo;ve slept,</p>
<p>our adenosine levels are lower than they were</p>
<p>when we went to sleep the previous night.</p>
<p>If you slept well enough and long enough,</p>
<p>those adenosine levels can be very, very low,</p>
<p>but they are never completely zero.</p>
<p>When you wake up in the morning,</p>
<p>even if you&rsquo;re one of these people that springs out of bed</p>
<p>and is ready to attack the day,</p>
<p>and here I&rsquo;m certainly not describing myself,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not one of those people.</p>
<p>I tend to wake fairly slowly.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re one of those spring up and attack the day,</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re one of the people who moves more slowly</p>
<p>into your day, regardless,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s still some residual adenosine in your system.</p>
<p>And this is particularly the case</p>
<p>if you did not get enough sleep</p>
<p>or enough depth of sleep the night before,</p>
<p>the correct ratios of slow wave sleep</p>
<p>and rapid eye movement sleep.</p>
<p>And for those of you interested in optimizing sleep,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just refer you to our Master Your Sleep episode</p>
<p>of the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>the Perfect Your Sleep episode of the Huberman Lab Podcast.</p>
<p>And we have a toolkit for sleep,</p>
<p>all of which are available zero cost,</p>
<p>timestamped, et cetera, at hubermanlab.com.</p>
<p>You wake up in the morning</p>
<p>and your adenosine levels are low, but they&rsquo;re not zero.</p>
<p>And if you didn&rsquo;t sleep that well</p>
<p>or deeply enough the night before,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to have more adenosine in your system.</p>
<p>You might think the logical thing to do</p>
<p>is therefore to drink caffeine</p>
<p>and to block the adenosine that&rsquo;s there.</p>
<p>But what happens if you do that is there&rsquo;s an accumulation,</p>
<p>a sort of glut of adenosine that hangs around.</p>
<p>And then in the afternoon,</p>
<p>when the effects of that caffeine start to wear off,</p>
<p>you will experience the so-called afternoon crash.</p>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, there is a way to clear out</p>
<p>the adenosine that&rsquo;s present</p>
<p>when you wake up in the morning</p>
<p>and to clear it out essentially completely</p>
<p>without just blocking its receptors</p>
<p>and letting it accumulate or hang around.</p>
<p>And the way to do that</p>
<p>is to deliberately spike your cortisol.</p>
<p>Now, many of you have heard of cortisol,</p>
<p>the so-called stress hormone, as a bad thing.</p>
<p>And indeed, chronically elevated cortisol is a bad thing.</p>
<p>It depletes your immune system.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s bad for psychosocial effects.</p>
<p>It tends to make us feel anxious and on and on.</p>
<p>But cortisol itself is not bad.</p>
<p>Cortisol is wonderful.</p>
<p>Cortisol enhances the efficiency of the immune system.</p>
<p>It makes us alert and focused.</p>
<p>It stimulates our metabolism.</p>
<p>It does a huge number of positive things</p>
<p>provided that it is released in a circadian fashion,</p>
<p>that is at the appropriate times every 24 hours,</p>
<p>and that it tends to peak very close to waking.</p>
<p>In fact, one of the reasons you wake up in the morning,</p>
<p>assuming that you weren&rsquo;t woken up by some noise</p>
<p>or sleeping in an environment that&rsquo;s too warm, et cetera,</p>
<p>is that your cortisol levels start to rise.</p>
<p>And shortly after waking,</p>
<p>your cortisol levels will start to reach their peak.</p>
<p>And when I refer to a cortisol pulse,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just biology nerd speak</p>
<p>for a rise and peak in cortisol.</p>
<p>You want that cortisol pulse to occur early in the day,</p>
<p>close to waking.</p>
<p>And you want that for a couple of reasons.</p>
<p>First of all,</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t restrict that cortisol pulse</p>
<p>to early in the day,</p>
<p>it will tend to bleed into the later parts of the day.</p>
<p>And actually a late shifted cortisol peak</p>
<p>is one of the hallmark signatures of depression,</p>
<p>low-level depression and serious depression.</p>
<p>And it can start to disrupt sleep</p>
<p>and certainly can disrupt mood metabolism</p>
<p>and your immune system.</p>
<p>So you want that cortisol peak early in the day.</p>
<p>How do you ensure that that happens?</p>
<p>Well, you wake up in the morning</p>
<p>and whether or not you&rsquo;re a bounce out of bed type</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re a more groggy,</p>
<p>you know, kind of wade slowly into the day type like I am,</p>
<p>you wake up and you don&rsquo;t ingest caffeine.</p>
<p>Fine and in fact,</p>
<p>beneficial to hydrate with water and electrolytes.</p>
<p>Terrific, in fact,</p>
<p>I would say necessary to get bright light in your eyes,</p>
<p>ideally from sunlight.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked about this many, many times</p>
<p>before on the podcast.</p>
<p>If you wake up before the sun comes out,</p>
<p>then turn on bright artificial lights.</p>
<p>But then certainly once the sun is out</p>
<p>and even on cloudy days,</p>
<p>in fact, especially on cloudy days,</p>
<p>get outside for anywhere from five to 20,</p>
<p>maybe even 30 minutes,</p>
<p>do some work outside,</p>
<p>take your breakfast outside.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a breakfast eater,</p>
<p>get something done outside,</p>
<p>even if it&rsquo;s just to get outside</p>
<p>and get bright light in your eyes.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Well, because it&rsquo;s been shown in studies on humans</p>
<p>that getting bright light in your eyes</p>
<p>in the first hour after waking</p>
<p>or as soon as possible after waking</p>
<p>increases the peak of that cortisol pulse by 50%, five, zero.</p>
<p>And that cortisol pulse,</p>
<p>yes, increases mood,</p>
<p>yes, increases alertness,</p>
<p>but it does one other very important thing,</p>
<p>which is that through an indirect pathway,</p>
<p>it can clear out any residual adenosine</p>
<p>that might be present in your system</p>
<p>when you wake up in the morning.</p>
<p>Again, this is going to be especially important</p>
<p>for those of you that are not getting as much sleep</p>
<p>or as much quality sleep as you would like.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be very important for you</p>
<p>to get that morning bright light, ideally from sunlight,</p>
<p>get that cortisol peak going.</p>
<p>Other ways to increase that cortisol peak</p>
<p>would be to do some physical activity.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t have time to do a full workout,</p>
<p>well then getting some movement,</p>
<p>10 minutes of skipping rope</p>
<p>or even five minutes of skipping rope</p>
<p>or jumping jacks or walking,</p>
<p>if that&rsquo;s all you have time for,</p>
<p>ideally while getting the sunlight in your eyes,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s going to zero out</p>
<p>the adenosine present in your system.</p>
<p>If however, you were to wake up</p>
<p>and immediately drink caffeine,</p>
<p>caffeine itself can stimulate the release of cortisol</p>
<p>a little bit more than it would otherwise</p>
<p>be present in your system.</p>
<p>But by blocking those adenosine receptors</p>
<p>and because of the indirect effects of caffeine</p>
<p>on the cortisol system,</p>
<p>you actually are reducing the clearance of adenosine</p>
<p>that would otherwise occur.</p>
<p>So I realize that&rsquo;s a mouthful, just to be very clear.</p>
<p>If you wake up and you ingest caffeine right away,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re blocking the adenosine receptor,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re not clearing it out.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re also preventing cortisol</p>
<p>from having its normal increase in rise</p>
<p>such that it can directly clear out adenosine</p>
<p>because cortisol can clear out adenosine.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what you want.</p>
<p>You want to be at maximum alertness and focus</p>
<p>in your morning and throughout your day.</p>
<p>And by delaying your caffeine to 90 to 120 minutes</p>
<p>after waking, you set up your system</p>
<p>so that you get that morning cortisol peak,</p>
<p>ideally a peak that&rsquo;s even greater</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re getting your bright light viewing.</p>
<p>And then when you ingest your caffeine</p>
<p>90 to 120 minutes after waking,</p>
<p>not only will you be craving it just a little bit,</p>
<p>but you will be drinking that caffeine</p>
<p>on an already existing backdrop of increased alertness</p>
<p>for two reasons.</p>
<p>One is adenosine is zeroed out</p>
<p>and your cortisol peak is higher.</p>
<p>And so now when you ingest caffeine,</p>
<p>you can actually ingest levels of caffeine</p>
<p>that are a little more reasonable</p>
<p>that almost with certainty are going to fall</p>
<p>in this one to three milligrams per kilogram dosage</p>
<p>and will allow you to feel really alert</p>
<p>and will carry that alertness well into the afternoon hours</p>
<p>without the need to drink more caffeine</p>
<p>and thereby will prevent you from drinking caffeine</p>
<p>and disrupting your nighttime sleep.</p>
<p>And of course, by getting better nighttime sleep,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to zero out your adenosine even more.</p>
<p>So what I&rsquo;m describing here are essentially two tools.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m telling you to get morning sunlight</p>
<p>and maybe some exercise in conjunction with that,</p>
<p>even if it&rsquo;s brief exercise.</p>
<p>But the main tool of delaying caffeine 90 to 120 minutes</p>
<p>after waking has immediate effects,</p>
<p>but it also sets in motion a cascade or domino falls</p>
<p>that lead to better sleep and more wakefulness</p>
<p>the next night and the next day and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>Now, I realize there are some people</p>
<p>who just simply cannot or will not delay their caffeine</p>
<p>90 to 120 minutes after waking for whatever reason.</p>
<p>First off, let me say that if you are somebody</p>
<p>who likes to wake up and do very intense exercise</p>
<p>within the first 90 minutes after waking,</p>
<p>well, in that case, it would be appropriate</p>
<p>to ingest your caffeine just prior to doing that exercise.</p>
<p>Not a problem, not a problem,</p>
<p>but you should expect that the combination</p>
<p>of drinking caffeine very shortly after waking</p>
<p>plus exercising very intensely shortly after waking</p>
<p>will increase the intensity of that early afternoon</p>
<p>and afternoon fatigue that you feel.</p>
<p>Now, for some people, that&rsquo;s a great thing.</p>
<p>They can afford to take a nap or do non-sleep depressed,</p>
<p>step away from work and so forth.</p>
<p>In that case, I strongly encourage you to do whatever it is</p>
<p>that allows you to get regular exercise</p>
<p>because regular exercise is going to be very beneficial.</p>
<p>In fact, we did an entire episode</p>
<p>called Toolkit for Fitness that describes</p>
<p>a couple of different, but really one main structure</p>
<p>that allows you to get the appropriate amount</p>
<p>of resistance training and cardiovascular training</p>
<p>and flexibility training throughout the week.</p>
<p>I happen to follow that program and it works very well</p>
<p>and it does involve some of those workouts</p>
<p>to come very early in the morning, shortly after waking,</p>
<p>and in those cases, I do ingest caffeine just prior to those</p>
<p>so within 10, 20 minutes of waking.</p>
<p>However, on other days, I personally delay my caffeine</p>
<p>intake 90 to 120 minutes and I&rsquo;ve done that to great benefit</p>
<p>and most people, if not all people that try that</p>
<p>have reported the same.</p>
<p>I should mention that some people will find getting out</p>
<p>to that 90 minutes to be excruciatingly difficult</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re so accustomed to ingesting caffeine</p>
<p>close to waking up, in that case,</p>
<p>maybe just push out your caffeine intake</p>
<p>by about 15 minutes each day</p>
<p>until you hit that 90 to 120 minute mark</p>
<p>and that will make it much easier.</p>
<p>It might take you a week or so to get there,</p>
<p>but once you get there,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll find it to be quite easy to maintain.</p>
<p>The other thing is that if you are somebody</p>
<p>who insists on drinking caffeine very shortly after waking,</p>
<p>I would encourage you to drink half of your caffeine then</p>
<p>and then the other half of your caffeine</p>
<p>about an hour later.</p>
<p>That also will help offset some of the afternoon crash</p>
<p>for reasons related to the so-called kinetics of caffeine.</p>
<p>Caffeine has a quarter life of about 12 hours.</p>
<p>That means that if you were to ingest a cup of coffee</p>
<p>at let&rsquo;s say 8 a.m. and let&rsquo;s say 100 milligram coffee</p>
<p>just for sake of simplicity,</p>
<p>that about 25% of that caffeine action,</p>
<p>we wouldn&rsquo;t really say 25 milligrams,</p>
<p>but about 25% of that caffeine action</p>
<p>will still be present at 8 p.m. that night,</p>
<p>which is pretty remarkable.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a long arc of caffeine effects</p>
<p>and this is why it can impede sleep</p>
<p>if we take caffeine in the afternoon.</p>
<p>But again, if you&rsquo;re somebody who wakes up</p>
<p>and you really need caffeine right away</p>
<p>and you refuse to do this 90 to 120 minute delay thing</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m talking about,</p>
<p>well then in that case,</p>
<p>I would drink half of your caffeine upon waking</p>
<p>and then a little bit more or the other half</p>
<p>about an hour later.</p>
<p>And that will extend the arc of that caffeine effects</p>
<p>such that you don&rsquo;t need it again in the afternoon</p>
<p>because you won&rsquo;t experience the afternoon crash.</p>
<p>Because of the way caffeine works,</p>
<p>I should mention that if you ingest caffeine</p>
<p>on an empty stomach,</p>
<p>it will have a more potent stimulant effect</p>
<p>that will also tend to increase the level of jitteriness</p>
<p>that caffeine can produce.</p>
<p>Later, I&rsquo;ll talk about ways to offset that jitteriness,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ll just tell you one tool now.</p>
<p>Many people opt to take 100 milligrams of theanine,</p>
<p>T-H-E-A-N-I-N-E, theanine,</p>
<p>as a way to offset some of that jitteriness.</p>
<p>Theanine will reduce the jitteriness of caffeine,</p>
<p>which is why many energy drink manufacturers</p>
<p>and even some coffee manufacturers</p>
<p>are now putting theanine in energy drinks</p>
<p>and in ground coffee because, no surprise,</p>
<p>it allows people to consume more of that beverage</p>
<p>and thereby purchase more of that beverage,</p>
<p>which is what these vendors want,</p>
<p>without feeling overly anxious and jittery.</p>
<p>So you can take Pilform theanine</p>
<p>if you want with your caffeine.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t tend to do that.</p>
<p>Rather, I control the total dosage of my caffeine.</p>
<p>I do tend to consume caffeine on an empty stomach</p>
<p>because I do restrict my caffeine intake</p>
<p>to the early part of the day.</p>
<p>And I generally eat my first meal somewhere around 11 a.m.</p>
<p>And then I generally eat my last meal</p>
<p>sometime around 8 p.m. or so.</p>
<p>Those are averages.</p>
<p>I would say plus or minus an hour.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not because I&rsquo;m religiously following</p>
<p>any kind of time-restricted feeding.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that tends to work best</p>
<p>with my schedule and my appetite.</p>
<p>But again, that&rsquo;s a general theme.</p>
<p>There are days in which I wake up and I&rsquo;m very hungry</p>
<p>and I might ingest something, a small snack or something,</p>
<p>or if I&rsquo;m meeting somebody for breakfast,</p>
<p>sometimes I&rsquo;ll have breakfast, sometimes I won&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>The point is that you can get away</p>
<p>with drinking less caffeine to get the stimulant effect</p>
<p>if you do it on an empty stomach.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re somebody who likes to exercise</p>
<p>on an empty stomach, and I&rsquo;m one of those people,</p>
<p>well, then ingesting caffeine just prior to exercise</p>
<p>can be a fantastic tool.</p>
<p>A little bit later, we&rsquo;ll talk about some of the</p>
<p>physical performance-enhancing effects of caffeine,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ll just briefly jump to a point about that</p>
<p>as we relate to morning exercise.</p>
<p>If you are somebody who regularly ingests caffeine,</p>
<p>and we can define regularly by</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;ve ingested caffeine every day</p>
<p>for the last two weeks,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re a regular consumer of caffeine,</p>
<p>whereas if you&rsquo;re somebody who only ingests caffeine</p>
<p>somewhere between two and four times per week,</p>
<p>well, then you are not a regular consumer of caffeine,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re an intermittent user of caffeine.</p>
<p>Well, if you&rsquo;re somebody who&rsquo;s a regular user of caffeine,</p>
<p>the performance-enhancing effects of caffeine</p>
<p>are going to be most dramatic</p>
<p>if you take two or three days off from drinking caffeine,</p>
<p>which to my mind, I don&rsquo;t want to call myself a caffeine addict</p>
<p>but a regular caffeine user, that&rsquo;s a horrible notion to me,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an aversive notion</p>
<p>because I do like the effects of caffeine so much,</p>
<p>but if you really want to see the maximum performance</p>
<p>enhancing effects of caffeine,</p>
<p>you will do either one of two things,</p>
<p>you will either abstain from caffeine for a few days</p>
<p>or three days prior to ingesting caffeine,</p>
<p>or you will use caffeine on an empty stomach.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very clear that caffeine on an empty stomach</p>
<p>enhances both the mental and physical</p>
<p>enhancing effects of caffeine.</p>
<p>And of course, all of that has to be stated</p>
<p>on the backdrop of consideration</p>
<p>that if you&rsquo;re very, very hungry,</p>
<p>it can make it hard to concentrate and so on and so forth,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m not encouraging people to starve themselves</p>
<p>by any means, certainly don&rsquo;t do that,</p>
<p>but if you want to maximize</p>
<p>the performance-enhancing effects of caffeine,</p>
<p>you will consume it on an empty stomach.</p>
<p>And then as a final point to that, caffeine is a diuretic,</p>
<p>it causes us to lose fluid and along with that fluid</p>
<p>to excrete sodium because of the effects of caffeine</p>
<p>on various processes within the kidney.</p>
<p>So one thing that works very well</p>
<p>to maintain mood and alertness longer</p>
<p>given a certain amount of caffeine intake</p>
<p>and to avoid the jitteriness</p>
<p>and what can sometimes feel like a crash</p>
<p>or low blood sugar feeling or even blurry vision</p>
<p>is to make sure that you consume</p>
<p>at least an equal volume of water with your caffeine.</p>
<p>And ideally that water would contain</p>
<p>maybe a small pinch of salt</p>
<p>or some sort of electrolyte drink or powder rather.</p>
<p>For me, I use Element, full disclosure,</p>
<p>they are a podcast affiliate and sponsor,</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t need to do that.</p>
<p>You could simply just have a glass of water</p>
<p>alongside your coffee or espresso or your yerba mate</p>
<p>and just put a small pinch of sea salt in that</p>
<p>or even just plain table salt.</p>
<p>And that will help offset</p>
<p>some of the jitteriness of caffeine.</p>
<p>A lot of people think that when they ingest caffeine,</p>
<p>they get the jitteriness and crash</p>
<p>because their blood sugar is low.</p>
<p>And while that can be the case,</p>
<p>oftentimes it&rsquo;s simply because of the excretion of sodium</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s occurred when they&rsquo;ve ingested caffeine.</p>
<p>So I encourage you to hydrate well</p>
<p>and to hydrate with something</p>
<p>that contains a little bit of sodium,</p>
<p>obviously not so much that increases hypertension</p>
<p>or something of that sort,</p>
<p>but a small amount of sodium</p>
<p>or an electrolyte drink like Element.</p>
<p>And there are other electrolyte drinks out there</p>
<p>that can accomplish the same, of course.</p>
<p>Just a couple of quick notes about theanine</p>
<p>because there are a growing number of products out there</p>
<p>that contain theanine.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s certainly a growing number of people out there</p>
<p>who are using theanine for the effect</p>
<p>that I described before,</p>
<p>which is to offset some of the jitteriness</p>
<p>associated with caffeine-containing beverages or foods.</p>
<p>And of course, I should mention</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve talked about the effects of theanine on sleep.</p>
<p>At that sleep toolkit that you can find as a free download,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t even have to sign up for anything.</p>
<p>You can just download it from hubermanlab.com,</p>
<p>go to the menu, go to newsletter,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll see the toolkit for sleep.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll see that the so-called sleep stack</p>
<p>that I use and recommend includes magnesium threonate,</p>
<p>something called apigenin and theanine.</p>
<p>Although that sleep stack is designed to be taken</p>
<p>30 to 60 minutes prior to sleep.</p>
<p>And I make the point there, and I&rsquo;ll make it again here,</p>
<p>that ingesting theanine prior to sleep is not a good idea</p>
<p>if you are somebody who tends to have very vivid dreams,</p>
<p>night terrors or sleepwalking, excuse me, et cetera.</p>
<p>In that case, eliminate theanine from the sleep stack.</p>
<p>However, a number of people are using theanine</p>
<p>and products are using theanine to offset jitteriness</p>
<p>from caffeine-containing products during the daytime,</p>
<p>daytime consumption that is.</p>
<p>A couple of notes about theanine.</p>
<p>Theanine is something that is present in green tea, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s now been created as a supplement.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s called a non-protein amino acid.</p>
<p>So while there are amino acids and proteins,</p>
<p>there are of course amino acids and non-proteins</p>
<p>and theanine is one such non-protein amino acid.</p>
<p>Theanine tends to stimulate the so-called glutamate</p>
<p>and glutamine pathway.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually very similar to glutamate and glutamine.</p>
<p>And it has a lot of effects on a lot of different aspects</p>
<p>of the nervous system.</p>
<p>But the general effect of theanine is to compete</p>
<p>for the receptors for certain neurotransmitters.</p>
<p>And the neurotransmitters I&rsquo;m referring to</p>
<p>are all excitatory neurotransmitters, things like glutamate.</p>
<p>And they govern a tremendous amount of our daily thinking</p>
<p>and action and feeling, et cetera,</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re present at so many connections</p>
<p>between neurons in the brain.</p>
<p>Theanine competes for the receptors for glutamate</p>
<p>and tends to reduce our overall levels of alertness.</p>
<p>So really when people take theanine along with caffeine,</p>
<p>what they&rsquo;re doing is they&rsquo;re really taking a slight,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to call it depressant</p>
<p>to the point where it misleads people</p>
<p>and makes people think that it will make you depressed.</p>
<p>The word is a little bit misleading,</p>
<p>but tends to reduce or blunt some of the more excitatory</p>
<p>pro-alertness actions of neurons in the brain.</p>
<p>So when you take it alongside caffeine,</p>
<p>tends to quote unquote, even things out a bit.</p>
<p>I should mention that the dosages of theanine</p>
<p>that are effective for offsetting the jitteriness</p>
<p>of caffeine is 200 to 400 milligrams.</p>
<p>And the studies that I was able to find showed</p>
<p>that essentially up to 900 milligrams per day can be safe,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s a very high dosage of theanine.</p>
<p>In fact, so much so that it might increase sleepiness</p>
<p>to the point where it wouldn&rsquo;t feel good.</p>
<p>There are also some positive effects</p>
<p>of daytime consumption of theanine that are independent</p>
<p>of reducing the jitteriness of caffeine.</p>
<p>For instance, there&rsquo;s a study demonstrating</p>
<p>that 17 days of ingesting theanine</p>
<p>at this 200 to 400 milligram dosage</p>
<p>of at one to three times per day</p>
<p>can reduce depression and anxiety.</p>
<p>There are also some good data out there showing</p>
<p>that theanine can have positive effects</p>
<p>on endothelial cells, so blood vessels,</p>
<p>capillaries, and so on,</p>
<p>and increase some of the functional blood vessels,</p>
<p>allowing them to pass more blood through them</p>
<p>and give them a little bit more elasticity, if you will.</p>
<p>So theanine has certain pro-sleep effects</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s taken prior to sleep.</p>
<p>It can enhance the quality, depth, and duration of sleep.</p>
<p>Again, if you&rsquo;re a sleepwalker</p>
<p>or somebody who has extremely vivid dreams</p>
<p>from which you wake up in the middle of the night,</p>
<p>probably best to leave out theanine</p>
<p>or maybe reduce the dosage down to 100 milligrams.</p>
<p>And if that&rsquo;s still too much, then eliminate it completely.</p>
<p>But theanine can be terrific</p>
<p>for enhancing quality, depth, and duration of sleep.</p>
<p>It can also reduce the jitteriness</p>
<p>associated with caffeine-containing beverages and foods.</p>
<p>And it has certain antidepressant and pro-endothelial effects</p>
<p>that is it can offset depression, it can offset anxiety,</p>
<p>although those are minor effects, okay, subtle effects.</p>
<p>And it has been shown to improve endothelial cell,</p>
<p>that is vessel and capillary function and structure</p>
<p>in ways that can be beneficial for both brain and body.</p>
<p>Now, one final point about theanine</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s worth paying attention to</p>
<p>is that the kinetics of theanine are such</p>
<p>that you don&rsquo;t need to take theanine</p>
<p>every time you ingest a caffeinated beverage.</p>
<p>When we ingest caffeine,</p>
<p>the peak effects of caffeine occur about 30 minutes</p>
<p>after we drink it.</p>
<p>And there, I&rsquo;m assuming one takes it all at once.</p>
<p>And this is a key point that we&rsquo;ll come back to later,</p>
<p>rather than sipping your coffee slowly</p>
<p>over a couple of hours or an hour.</p>
<p>If you drink all 200 or 300 milligrams of caffeine</p>
<p>in your coffee or 600 milligrams of your coffee,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re getting one of those commercial coffees,</p>
<p>and you take theanine along with it,</p>
<p>theanine will block some of the jitteriness</p>
<p>and anxiety-inducing effects of caffeine</p>
<p>that can occur for much longer</p>
<p>than the effects that caffeine lasts.</p>
<p>So, the peak in theanine occurs</p>
<p>about an hour after ingestion.</p>
<p>I suppose if you wanted to get really fancy</p>
<p>and really dial in the kinetics,</p>
<p>you could ingest theanine about a half hour</p>
<p>before you ingest your caffeine.</p>
<p>But I think that&rsquo;s getting a little bit excessive</p>
<p>in terms of controlling your microenvironment, if you will.</p>
<p>I think it would be perfectly fine</p>
<p>to take a 100 to 200 milligram capsule of theanine</p>
<p>along with your coffee or tea and so forth.</p>
<p>And just realize that if you drink more caffeine</p>
<p>or you extend your caffeine intake over several hours,</p>
<p>that you don&rsquo;t necessarily have to take theanine</p>
<p>repeated times throughout the day.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk for a moment about when to avoid caffeine.</p>
<p>And in the same stroke,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s also talk about some of the myths around caffeine.</p>
<p>For instance, one of the major myths around caffeine</p>
<p>is that it can increase osteoporosis.</p>
<p>Turns out that while there is a relationship, of course,</p>
<p>between calcium and osteoporosis,</p>
<p>that is reductions in bone density.</p>
<p>And it is the case that caffeine can extract calcium</p>
<p>from certain tissues.</p>
<p>The large scale studies that are out there</p>
<p>essentially prove that if people are ingesting</p>
<p>enough calcium through their diet, which most everybody is,</p>
<p>although certainly there are some people</p>
<p>that need to supplement calcium</p>
<p>or make it a point to consume more calcium-containing foods.</p>
<p>But assuming that you are getting adequate levels of calcium,</p>
<p>there is no direct relationship</p>
<p>between caffeine intake and osteoporosis,</p>
<p>at least not that I&rsquo;m aware of.</p>
<p>I know this was debated for a number of years</p>
<p>in the literature,</p>
<p>but the literature seems to have arrived</p>
<p>at a general consensus now that caffeine itself</p>
<p>is not going to create or exacerbate osteoporosis,</p>
<p>provided people are getting enough calcium</p>
<p>through their diet, that is through foods,</p>
<p>through supplementation, or both.</p>
<p>Some of the other myths around caffeine</p>
<p>are that, for instance, caffeine will reduce</p>
<p>testosterone levels or will reduce estrogen levels.</p>
<p>Other myths out there are an exact opposite to that,</p>
<p>that caffeine will increase testosterone levels,</p>
<p>in particular, free testosterone levels.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;ve been some large-scale studies</p>
<p>addressing the hormone effects of caffeine.</p>
<p>They are a little bit difficult to do.</p>
<p>I should just mention that caveat.</p>
<p>And the reason they are difficult to do</p>
<p>is because 90% of adults are consuming caffeine,</p>
<p>and therefore, you can imagine,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very hard to find a control group</p>
<p>to compare the caffeine consumers to,</p>
<p>in particular, a control group</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s well-controlled for other things</p>
<p>like lifestyle, diet, exercise, et cetera.</p>
<p>However, when one controls as well as one can</p>
<p>for all the various factors that could impact hormones,</p>
<p>what one discovers is that caffeine intake,</p>
<p>at least at the dosages we talked about earlier,</p>
<p>one to three milligrams per kilogram of body weight,</p>
<p>or even up to double that,</p>
<p>that there are no consistent increases or reductions</p>
<p>in testosterone or estrogen in men or women</p>
<p>that can be directly attributed to the caffeine intake.</p>
<p>And I say directly attributed</p>
<p>because in these association studies,</p>
<p>one always has to wonder, for instance,</p>
<p>if because people are ingesting more caffeine,</p>
<p>they have more energy and therefore exercising more</p>
<p>and exercise is known to have effects</p>
<p>on testosterone, estrogen, and other hormones,</p>
<p>whether or not the effects of caffeine on those hormones</p>
<p>is indirect and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>And this all just underscores the challenges</p>
<p>of doing studies on humans in the wild</p>
<p>in their natural habitat of living,</p>
<p>as opposed to an acute study, as it&rsquo;s called,</p>
<p>to bring someone into the laboratory</p>
<p>and studying them just for those hours or moments.</p>
<p>With all that said, there does appear to be a relationship</p>
<p>between caffeine intake and so-called sex hormone</p>
<p>binding globulin, which is a protein present in the body</p>
<p>of both men and women that binds to the sex steroid hormones,</p>
<p>testosterone and estrogen,</p>
<p>and prevents them from being in their free or active form.</p>
<p>It has been shown that ingestion of caffeine,</p>
<p>even in the sorts dosage ranges that are considered safe</p>
<p>and that we&rsquo;ve been discussing,</p>
<p>can increase sex hormone binding globulin</p>
<p>such that it can slightly reduce overall levels</p>
<p>of free testosterone and free estradiol in women.</p>
<p>Now, those effects are relatively minor, but they do exist.</p>
<p>If any of you are interested in reading further</p>
<p>into the effects of caffeine on hormones,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just refer you to a couple of studies.</p>
<p>We will link to this in the show note caption.</p>
<p>The title of the study is consumption of caffeinated</p>
<p>beverages and serum concentrations</p>
<p>of sex steroid hormones in US men.</p>
<p>And within this study, there&rsquo;s a reference</p>
<p>to a equally sized empowered study done on women,</p>
<p>both of which converged on the same conclusion</p>
<p>by examining more than a thousand.</p>
<p>So in this case, 1,410 men or more than a thousand women</p>
<p>that there are increases in sex hormone binding globulin</p>
<p>associated with increased intake of coffee in particular,</p>
<p>but they were able to narrow that down specifically</p>
<p>to ingestion of caffeine.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not coffee per se that&rsquo;s causing the increase</p>
<p>in sex hormone binding globulin.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually caffeine itself.</p>
<p>Now, again, the increases in sex hormone binding globulin</p>
<p>were not so significant that at least to my mind,</p>
<p>they seem like a concern.</p>
<p>Although I think that it is worth noting</p>
<p>that if you&rsquo;re going to consume caffeine,</p>
<p>that you probably want to consume caffeine in a way</p>
<p>that is in dosages and with the sort of timing</p>
<p>that will allow you to get away with ingesting caffeine,</p>
<p>but not to excess.</p>
<p>So to derive the benefits of caffeine without, for instance,</p>
<p>driving up sex hormone binding globulin too far.</p>
<p>Now, why would that be a good idea?</p>
<p>Why would you want to make sure</p>
<p>that you have enough free testosterone and free estrogen?</p>
<p>Well, some of that is related to the acute effects</p>
<p>of those hormones in terms of wellbeing and libido</p>
<p>and strength and mood, et cetera.</p>
<p>But some of this also relates to the longer term effects</p>
<p>of sex steroid hormones.</p>
<p>Many people don&rsquo;t realize this,</p>
<p>but the sex steroid hormones operate on the receptors</p>
<p>at the surface of cells to have immediate effects,</p>
<p>but they also can enter cells</p>
<p>and actually go into the nucleus of cells</p>
<p>where the DNA of those cells are contained</p>
<p>and control gene expression in those cells.</p>
<p>So the sex steroid hormones, testosterone and estrogen</p>
<p>are controlling a lot of different cellular functions</p>
<p>over long periods of time.</p>
<p>So blunting their action over long periods of time</p>
<p>is probably not a great idea.</p>
<p>But again, at the dosages of caffeine</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re talking about today,</p>
<p>one to three milligrams per kilogram of body weight,</p>
<p>unlikely that the increases in sex hormone binding globulin</p>
<p>that one experiences from that are going to be detrimental.</p>
<p>And certainly the positive effects of caffeine</p>
<p>that one experiences in terms of mental performance</p>
<p>and physical performance,</p>
<p>and the fact that it increases energy</p>
<p>to do the sorts of things like exercise</p>
<p>that we know can profoundly improve hormone profiles,</p>
<p>twofold or threefold improvement in hormone profiles.</p>
<p>In that case, it seems that ingesting caffeine</p>
<p>is overall a good thing provided it&rsquo;s not in excess.</p>
<p>That also makes this the appropriate time to mention</p>
<p>one of the more impressive effects of caffeine,</p>
<p>which is on overall levels of mood and mental health.</p>
<p>There are several studies on this,</p>
<p>but the one that I&rsquo;m particularly fond of</p>
<p>was published in 2019 in Psychiatry Research.</p>
<p>And the title of the paper is Inverse Association</p>
<p>Between Caffeine Intake and Depressive Symptoms</p>
<p>in US Adults.</p>
<p>And these are data from the National Health</p>
<p>and Nutrition Examination Survey.</p>
<p>And the basic takeaway is that while of course</p>
<p>there are a ton of different factors</p>
<p>that are going to relate to whether or not</p>
<p>people are depressed or not,</p>
<p>life circumstances, genetics, and so on,</p>
<p>that, and here I&rsquo;m quoting from the study,</p>
<p>caffeine&rsquo;s psychostimulant properties,</p>
<p>that just means the ability to make us feel more alert</p>
<p>and positive, appear to protect against depressive symptoms.</p>
<p>And of course they acknowledge</p>
<p>that additional studies are needed,</p>
<p>but this is just one of several studies</p>
<p>pointing to the fact that people who regularly ingest caffeine</p>
<p>in the appropriate dosages do seem to enjoy</p>
<p>an antidepressive effect overall.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t want anyone to consider caffeine</p>
<p>a treatment for severe depression,</p>
<p>or at least not alone a treatment for severe depression,</p>
<p>but provided the anxiety-inducing effects of caffeine</p>
<p>can be kept in check through use of theanine</p>
<p>or making sure that the dosage</p>
<p>and the timing of caffeine ingestion is correct,</p>
<p>then caffeine overall seems to be good for our mood</p>
<p>and prevent depression or at least keep depression at bay</p>
<p>when depression might otherwise surface or be more severe.</p>
<p>And of course there are the don&rsquo;ts</p>
<p>surrounding caffeine intake as it relates to sleep.</p>
<p>And to put it very simply,</p>
<p>sleep, that is getting enough quality sleep each night,</p>
<p>is the foundation, it is the bedrock of mental health,</p>
<p>physical health, and performance.</p>
<p>Sleep and the power of sleep far exceeds</p>
<p>any nootropic you could ever take,</p>
<p>any prescription drug you could ever take,</p>
<p>any health-promoting tool for your immune system,</p>
<p>your metabolism, your mental function,</p>
<p>your physical function you could ever take.</p>
<p>Sleep is the bedrock.</p>
<p>I know a lot of people experience challenge with sleep.</p>
<p>Nobody is perfect about sleep,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s important to keep in mind.</p>
<p>I think a good goal is to get enough quality sleep</p>
<p>of sufficient duration, 80% of the nights of your life,</p>
<p>and then as much as possible to make sure</p>
<p>that the remaining 20% of nights</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not getting enough sleep for good reasons</p>
<p>as opposed to hard reasons.</p>
<p>Good reasons would include raising children,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s important.</p>
<p>After all, every species desires to make more of itself</p>
<p>and to preserve and extend the wellbeing of its young,</p>
<p>so child-rearing is a perfectly legitimate reason</p>
<p>to get a lack of sleep,</p>
<p>but you really want to strive to get quality sleep</p>
<p>most nights of your life,</p>
<p>which means that even if you&rsquo;re somebody</p>
<p>who can quote-unquote drink an espresso</p>
<p>and then fall right asleep,</p>
<p>that you avoid caffeine intake</p>
<p>in the 12 hours prior to sleep.</p>
<p>I realize not everyone will be able to do that,</p>
<p>and in fact, I sometimes violate that,</p>
<p>so I tend to go to sleep around 10 p.m. every night,</p>
<p>sometimes 11, occasionally 12 midnight,</p>
<p>but usually around 10 p.m. every night.</p>
<p>I confess that my last ingestion of caffeine</p>
<p>is not always 10 a.m. or prior to that,</p>
<p>so sometimes I will have caffeine up until 11 a.m.</p>
<p>or maybe noon, and very, very rarely</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll have an afternoon coffee or espresso</p>
<p>or non-calorie-containing soda or tea</p>
<p>or something of that sort,</p>
<p>but I really try to restrict my caffeine intake</p>
<p>to the early part of my day, that is before noon,</p>
<p>given that I go to sleep around 10 p.m. each night,</p>
<p>and I strongly encourage everyone out there</p>
<p>to try and limit their afternoon caffeine intake.</p>
<p>This is something that Dr. Matt Walker,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s an expert sleep researcher</p>
<p>out of University of California, Berkeley,</p>
<p>Psychology and Neuroscience Department there,</p>
<p>author of the incredible book, Why We Sleep.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s been on this podcast, many other podcasts,</p>
<p>talking about the importance of sleep.</p>
<p>He will remind us, and I&rsquo;ll remind you now,</p>
<p>that the quarter-life of caffeine is 12 hours.</p>
<p>I mentioned this earlier, but I&rsquo;m going to repeat it again,</p>
<p>and that means that if you ingest caffeine at noon,</p>
<p>25% of its effects, more or less,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m using a broad stroke here to talk about quarter-life,</p>
<p>25% of that is still going to be bioactive</p>
<p>at midnight that night,</p>
<p>which will disrupt the early phase of your night,</p>
<p>the amount of slow-wave sleep,</p>
<p>which then in turn will disrupt</p>
<p>the amount of rapid eye movement sleep,</p>
<p>which will disrupt your emotional processing</p>
<p>during the following day, and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>None of this is to say</p>
<p>that if you have the occasional cup of coffee</p>
<p>in the afternoon, that it&rsquo;s going to completely demolish</p>
<p>your sleep-wake cycle forever,</p>
<p>but I really encourage people to avoid drinking caffeine</p>
<p>in the 12 hours prior to sleep,</p>
<p>and if you can&rsquo;t do that within the 10 hours prior to sleep,</p>
<p>and if you can&rsquo;t do that</p>
<p>within the eight hours prior to sleep,</p>
<p>so really try and limit your caffeine intake</p>
<p>in the eight to 12 hours prior to going to sleep at night.</p>
<p>And of course, slow-wave sleep, aka deep sleep,</p>
<p>is the sleep that&rsquo;s associated with somewhat mundane dreams,</p>
<p>which makes it sound like it might not be that important,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also the sleep that&rsquo;s associated</p>
<p>with growth hormone release,</p>
<p>which is important for protein synthesis,</p>
<p>repair of all bodily tissues and metabolism,</p>
<p>and slow-wave sleep is also critically attached</p>
<p>to your immune system&rsquo;s ability</p>
<p>to clear out bacteria and viruses</p>
<p>that might otherwise infect your tissues.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;d like to talk about caffeine</p>
<p>and its positive effects on performance</p>
<p>when used correctly, and here we are referring</p>
<p>to both mental performance and physical performance.</p>
<p>The exploration of caffeine as a pro-performance tool</p>
<p>has been explored since the 1930s,</p>
<p>at least that&rsquo;s some</p>
<p>of the earliest documented literature on this,</p>
<p>although I have to imagine,</p>
<p>given that people have been using caffeine</p>
<p>for much longer than that,</p>
<p>that long ago somebody realized</p>
<p>that by ingesting a certain plant</p>
<p>that they felt much more alertness</p>
<p>and were able to hunt and gather</p>
<p>or do any number of different things better,</p>
<p>and as a consequence,</p>
<p>decided to consume more of that plant.</p>
<p>Now, these days we consume a lot of caffeine</p>
<p>in the form of coffee and tea mainly,</p>
<p>and some people consume it in the form</p>
<p>of caffeine tablets or energy drinks, et cetera.</p>
<p>Across the board, one finds that caffeine intake</p>
<p>at a level of one to three milligrams per kilogram</p>
<p>of body weight improves reaction time,</p>
<p>that is it reduces the amount of time</p>
<p>to take a physical action</p>
<p>or to answer a question correctly with a verbal response.</p>
<p>It can also improve coordination,</p>
<p>it can also improve memory,</p>
<p>although I do want to mention that whereas most studies</p>
<p>of the effects of caffeine on improving mental</p>
<p>and physical performance involve taking caffeine</p>
<p>at one to three milligrams per kilogram of body weight</p>
<p>before the mental task or physical task,</p>
<p>there is also a pro-performance effect of caffeine</p>
<p>on memory if one takes caffeine</p>
<p>after learning certain material,</p>
<p>or I should say being exposed to certain material.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll come back to that in a few minutes.</p>
<p>If one examines reaction time, mood, alertness,</p>
<p>focus, and memory or the ability to call up information</p>
<p>from memory or physical dexterity, power output, endurance</p>
<p>and overall feelings of wellbeing during exercise</p>
<p>and exertion, caffeine has been shown in numerous studies</p>
<p>in both men and women to improve all</p>
<p>of those metrics significantly.</p>
<p>So this is all just to say</p>
<p>that caffeine is an incredible performance enhancing tool.</p>
<p>Now, what&rsquo;s not obvious from the statement</p>
<p>that caffeine is a performance enhancing tool</p>
<p>across the board and in men and women</p>
<p>and in different contexts is that the way</p>
<p>in which caffeine is taken is very important.</p>
<p>Because 90% or more of adults consume caffeine,</p>
<p>finding controls for studies of caffeine</p>
<p>is really challenging.</p>
<p>That is finding people who don&rsquo;t ingest caffeine regularly</p>
<p>is a very challenging task for the researcher.</p>
<p>And as a consequence, many of the studies of caffeine</p>
<p>on human beings involve depriving regular caffeine users</p>
<p>of caffeine and then examining the effects of caffeine given</p>
<p>after a period of say five to 15 days of abstinence</p>
<p>in a person that is essentially experiencing</p>
<p>mild withdrawal symptoms because they haven&rsquo;t had</p>
<p>the caffeine that they were used to getting.</p>
<p>So this is an important point.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a point that likely exacerbates</p>
<p>the observed pro-performance effects of caffeine.</p>
<p>Now, all of that isn&rsquo;t necessarily a problem</p>
<p>provided you keep it in mind.</p>
<p>And it actually points to a way in which</p>
<p>even if you&rsquo;re a regular caffeine user,</p>
<p>you can extract more of the benefits of caffeine.</p>
<p>The simplest way to do this, for instance,</p>
<p>is to look back to what we talked about earlier</p>
<p>in terms of the need to have most</p>
<p>of your cortisol increase restricted to the hour or hours</p>
<p>just after waking in terms of mood</p>
<p>and alertness and performance.</p>
<p>One of the ways to increase the peak of that cortisol</p>
<p>early in the day is to consume caffeine shortly</p>
<p>after that peak occurs.</p>
<p>And this was really nicely demonstrated in a study</p>
<p>entitled Caffeine Stimulation of Cortisol Secretion</p>
<p>Across the Waking Hours in Relation to Caffeine</p>
<p>Intake Levels.</p>
<p>We will provide a link to this study.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a somewhat complicated study</p>
<p>because they looked at a bunch of different times of day</p>
<p>for caffeine intake.</p>
<p>And I should mention this study,</p>
<p>they use this 300 milligrams per day</p>
<p>or 600 milligrams per day.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s quite high,</p>
<p>although for people of sufficient body weight</p>
<p>and who are accustomed to taking caffeine,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s certainly not going to be in excess</p>
<p>of what a lot of people out there are taking.</p>
<p>But basically what they observed was the following.</p>
<p>Cortisol responses to caffeine are reduced</p>
<p>but not eliminated in people who consume caffeine</p>
<p>on a daily basis.</p>
<p>What this means is that if you wake up</p>
<p>and as I recommended earlier,</p>
<p>you avoid drinking caffeine for the first 90</p>
<p>to 120 minutes after waking,</p>
<p>but you do get some sunlight or other bright light</p>
<p>in your eyes in that time,</p>
<p>maybe even get some exercise in that time,</p>
<p>which would be even better.</p>
<p>And then you ingest caffeine,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll get a further increase in cortisol,</p>
<p>which provided it&rsquo;s restricted to the early part of the day</p>
<p>is a good thing overall for mood and alertness.</p>
<p>So this is a simple performance enhancing tool,</p>
<p>which is to stack caffeine on the tail</p>
<p>of that early cortisol peak.</p>
<p>I should also mention, however, that in this study,</p>
<p>they had people do a five-day caffeine abstinence</p>
<p>prior to being tested with 300 milligrams</p>
<p>or 600 milligrams of caffeine.</p>
<p>So the simple tool to extract from this</p>
<p>and other studies like it,</p>
<p>is that if you want to experience</p>
<p>the maximum alertness promoting effects of caffeine</p>
<p>when you ingest it early in the day,</p>
<p>you would abstain from caffeine for five days</p>
<p>and then ingest caffeine 90 to 120 minutes after waking.</p>
<p>I would still hope that you were doing</p>
<p>all the other things that I described,</p>
<p>morning sunlight, exercise, et cetera, correctly.</p>
<p>But regardless, it&rsquo;s very clear</p>
<p>that a five-day abstinence from caffeine,</p>
<p>however painful that might be,</p>
<p>will increase the performance enhancing effects of caffeine</p>
<p>when you take caffeine on that sixth day.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;m sure many of you out there are saying,</p>
<p>why would I ever want to abstain from caffeine</p>
<p>for five days in order to just get</p>
<p>this six-day performance enhancing effect?</p>
<p>Well, there are a couple of reasons for doing that.</p>
<p>Perhaps you&rsquo;re planning to travel to a new time zone</p>
<p>and you want to use caffeine as a stimulant</p>
<p>to stay up during the day in the new time zone.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a somewhat unusual case.</p>
<p>Others of you might be interested</p>
<p>in the pro-physical performance effects of caffeine.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll talk more about these in a little bit,</p>
<p>but you want to get the maximum strength increase</p>
<p>or the maximum endurance increase from ingesting,</p>
<p>in this case, 300 to 600 milligrams.</p>
<p>Well, in that case, abstaining from caffeine for five days</p>
<p>will greatly exacerbate the pro-performance effects</p>
<p>of caffeine when you take it on that sixth day.</p>
<p>Although, admittedly, those five days</p>
<p>are likely to be pretty painful</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re a regular caffeine user.</p>
<p>Another variation on this, however,</p>
<p>might be to halve the amount of caffeine</p>
<p>that you ingest on a daily basis</p>
<p>and then go back to your regular level of caffeine intake</p>
<p>on that day in which you need the caffeine</p>
<p>to really boost your mood, energy, and performance.</p>
<p>Another reason why you might want to abstain from caffeine</p>
<p>or reduce your caffeine intake for a period of time</p>
<p>and then go back to your regular caffeine intake</p>
<p>is simply to identify how much of an effect</p>
<p>caffeine is really having on your overall level</p>
<p>of daily functioning and mood.</p>
<p>This was something that was actually covered</p>
<p>in beautiful detail in a book by Michael Pollan</p>
<p>all about caffeine.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s available on Audible.</p>
<p>I really enjoyed that book.</p>
<p>It describes his experience with the decision</p>
<p>to completely abstain from caffeine for a period of months.</p>
<p>Although, I confess that after hearing that book,</p>
<p>what it basically made me want to do</p>
<p>is never quit drinking caffeine</p>
<p>because it sounded as if, at least my interpretation was,</p>
<p>that even after several weeks or months</p>
<p>of abstaining from caffeine,</p>
<p>that he still fantasized about the effects of caffeine.</p>
<p>But he did mention that when returning to ingesting caffeine</p>
<p>after a period of long abstinence,</p>
<p>that it had almost a, let&rsquo;s not call it a psychedelic</p>
<p>property, but it had such obvious effects</p>
<p>on mood and alertness and feelings of wellbeing</p>
<p>that it really highlighted for him</p>
<p>the extent to which caffeine normally was allowing him</p>
<p>to just function what he thought was normally.</p>
<p>So in other words, many of us don&rsquo;t even really know</p>
<p>what our normal basal level of cognitive</p>
<p>and physical functioning is</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re ingesting caffeine on such a regular basis.</p>
<p>I confess that as much as I enjoyed that book</p>
<p>and as intriguing as his description of caffeine abstinence</p>
<p>and then the return to caffeine was,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t intend to ever find out personally.</p>
<p>Now, a very good reason why you might want to abstain</p>
<p>from caffeine for a deliberate period of time</p>
<p>and then return to caffeine intake</p>
<p>is for its physical performance-enhancing effects.</p>
<p>And here we can look to a really interesting study,</p>
<p>title of which is Time Course of Tolerance</p>
<p>to the Performance Effects of Caffeine.</p>
<p>And what I like about this study is that while, yes,</p>
<p>it does say that abstaining from caffeine</p>
<p>and then returning to caffeine intake</p>
<p>can enhance physical performance in a very specific way,</p>
<p>it also says that if you take caffeine regularly,</p>
<p>you can still see the physical performance-enhancing effects</p>
<p>of caffeine, although they are not quite as robust</p>
<p>as they would be had you abstained from caffeine.</p>
<p>The design of the study is pretty straightforward.</p>
<p>They had people either ingest three milligrams</p>
<p>per kilogram of caffeine for 20 consecutive days.</p>
<p>Many people are already doing that, I realize,</p>
<p>but they had people do that</p>
<p>or ensure that they were doing that</p>
<p>or others ingested a placebo for 20 days.</p>
<p>So they abstained from caffeine without realizing it.</p>
<p>Then after that 20 days of either ingesting caffeine</p>
<p>or a placebo, their peak performance was measured</p>
<p>in terms of aerobic output,</p>
<p>but prior to that measurement, they had caffeine.</p>
<p>Okay, so it&rsquo;s 20 days of caffeine</p>
<p>and then a 21st day of caffeine</p>
<p>and then the physical task on that 21st day,</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s 20 days of abstinence from caffeine</p>
<p>and then on day 21, you get caffeine</p>
<p>and you get the same physical test.</p>
<p>And what they discovered was that the ingestion</p>
<p>of caffeine increased peak performance</p>
<p>in this aerobic output dramatically</p>
<p>if people had abstained from caffeine,</p>
<p>but for people that had consumed caffeine</p>
<p>all the way through up until that day,</p>
<p>it still was effective to ingest caffeine on day 21,</p>
<p>but not as effective as it would have been</p>
<p>had they abstained.</p>
<p>And in fact, the magnitude of the,</p>
<p>what they call ergogenic effect,</p>
<p>which is the pro-performance enhancing effect of caffeine,</p>
<p>was higher on the first day than in subsequent days</p>
<p>when they allowed people to continue caffeine intake.</p>
<p>So the takeaway from this study is really straightforward.</p>
<p>If you want to get the maximum physical performance</p>
<p>enhancing effects of caffeine,</p>
<p>you abstain from caffeine for 20 days,</p>
<p>then on day 21, when you&rsquo;re going to do the physical thing,</p>
<p>the task, you ingest caffeine about 30 minutes to an hour</p>
<p>before you do that physical challenge.</p>
<p>Now, 20 days of abstinence is going to be rough</p>
<p>for a lot of people.</p>
<p>I certainly don&rsquo;t want to sign up for this study,</p>
<p>in which case you might want to do five days of abstinence</p>
<p>as we talked about before.</p>
<p>And then on day six is the day that you ingest caffeine</p>
<p>and do the physical task.</p>
<p>There are even some studies showing</p>
<p>that you can abstain from caffeine for just two days,</p>
<p>for just 48 hours.</p>
<p>And in particular, if you are a regular user of caffeine,</p>
<p>this allows you to, on day three, ingest caffeine</p>
<p>at the dose that&rsquo;s appropriate for you</p>
<p>and do the physical,</p>
<p>or I should mention mental performance task</p>
<p>and perform significantly better</p>
<p>than those that have been taking caffeine</p>
<p>throughout the entire period leading up to the challenge.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t necessarily need to abstain for 20 days</p>
<p>in order to get the pro performance effects of caffeine</p>
<p>on day 21.</p>
<p>You could do five days of abstinence prior</p>
<p>or even two days of abstinence prior,</p>
<p>or if that&rsquo;s intolerable to you,</p>
<p>as it is in my mind to me,</p>
<p>to just reduce your caffeine intake slightly,</p>
<p>or even perhaps have it, if you can tolerate that,</p>
<p>in the week or two weeks,</p>
<p>or maybe even three weeks preceding</p>
<p>some physical or mental challenge.</p>
<p>Now, again, this sort of implies</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re going up against a marathon</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re going up against a series of long tests,</p>
<p>maybe standardized tests in one day.</p>
<p>There, I just really want to point out</p>
<p>that there is an abundant literature</p>
<p>showing that people perform best on mental tests</p>
<p>if they are in the state that they were</p>
<p>when they studied for that material.</p>
<p>Now, in college, I knew a number of people</p>
<p>who took this to the extreme,</p>
<p>thinking that if they were to study</p>
<p>under the effects of alcohol,</p>
<p>that they would be best off consuming alcohol</p>
<p>prior to taking exams,</p>
<p>and it turns out to not be the case.</p>
<p>Here, we&rsquo;re talking in particular</p>
<p>about psychostimulant effects of caffeine</p>
<p>and other compounds.</p>
<p>So don&rsquo;t think that you can drink</p>
<p>or be under the influence of THC</p>
<p>and then take, when you study,</p>
<p>and then take an exam under the same influence</p>
<p>and do just as well as you would</p>
<p>had you not ingested anything.</p>
<p>Please don&rsquo;t let that be the takeaway.</p>
<p>However, do let it be the takeaway</p>
<p>that caffeine&rsquo;s effects are made more potent</p>
<p>by a brief to not-so-brief period of abstinence</p>
<p>prior to taking a dosage of caffeine.</p>
<p>And then the final point to make</p>
<p>is that if you are somebody</p>
<p>who is not accustomed to drinking caffeine,</p>
<p>meaning you&rsquo;re hypersensitive to caffeine</p>
<p>or you don&rsquo;t regularly ingest caffeine,</p>
<p>please do not ingest caffeine</p>
<p>on the day of any important mental</p>
<p>or physical challenge or performance,</p>
<p>because what you will find</p>
<p>is that because you are not caffeine-adapted,</p>
<p>you will experience changes in your thermal regulation,</p>
<p>in your levels of anxiety and jitteriness,</p>
<p>and your levels of focus</p>
<p>that could be very detrimental</p>
<p>to mental or physical performance.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t want to throw yourself in the deep end</p>
<p>by ingesting caffeine if you&rsquo;re not used to it.</p>
<p>And I should mention that for people</p>
<p>that are not accustomed to ingesting caffeine</p>
<p>or are very sensitive to caffeine,</p>
<p>even 25 to 50 milligrams of caffeine</p>
<p>in the amount that&rsquo;s found in, for instance,</p>
<p>a piece of certain types of chocolate</p>
<p>can actually cause anxiety.</p>
<p>So be careful there.</p>
<p>Here, I&rsquo;m referring only to people</p>
<p>that are accustomed with caffeine intake.</p>
<p>So what I recommend is to explore</p>
<p>the ergogenic effects of caffeine during your training,</p>
<p>and then to make a decision</p>
<p>about what you can reasonably and reliably do</p>
<p>in terms of abstinence,</p>
<p>and then pulse with caffeine on the day of the challenge.</p>
<p>I get a lot of questions as to whether or not caffeine</p>
<p>has different effects on the nervous system</p>
<p>and on performance in particular,</p>
<p>depending on phases of the menstrual cycle.</p>
<p>So I explored that in my research for this episode,</p>
<p>and I found two studies,</p>
<p>both of which we will reference in the show note captions.</p>
<p>The first one is entitled</p>
<p>Caffeine Consumption and Menstrual Function.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s actually the relationship</p>
<p>between caffeine and menstrual function.</p>
<p>We will do an entire episode</p>
<p>about the menstrual cycle and menstrual function.</p>
<p>But the other one, as it relates to performance,</p>
<p>was published in 2020 in the European Journal of Nutrition,</p>
<p>which is Ergogenic Effects of Caffeine</p>
<p>on Peak Aerobic Cycling Power During the Menstrual Cycle.</p>
<p>And the basic takeaway of this study,</p>
<p>this is frankly a very nice study,</p>
<p>showed that, quote,</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Caffeine increased peak aerobic cycling power</p>
<p>in the early follicular, pre-ovulatory,</p>
<p>and mid-luteal phases of the menstrual cycle.</p>
<p>Thus, the ingestion,&rdquo;</p>
<p>and again, here they use three milligrams of caffeine</p>
<p>per kilogram of body mass,</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;might be considered an ergogenic aid</p>
<p>for women who are in the menstrual cycle</p>
<p>during all three phases of their cycle.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>So keep that in mind.</p>
<p>Women, for those of you that are regular users of caffeine</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re using caffeine to enhance physical performance,</p>
<p>there does not seem to be any menstrual cycle</p>
<p>phase-dependent effects of caffeine on performance.</p>
<p>That is, caffeine seems to always increase</p>
<p>physical performance,</p>
<p>regardless of the phase of the menstrual cycle</p>
<p>you might happen to be in.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to touch on a little bit more</p>
<p>of the use of caffeine for enhancing mental performance.</p>
<p>Yes, it is the case that ingesting one to three milligrams</p>
<p>of caffeine per kilogram of body weight</p>
<p>in the 30 minutes or so prior to doing a memory task</p>
<p>or sitting down to doing some studying</p>
<p>or learning of any kind,</p>
<p>physical or mental performance of any kind,</p>
<p>is beneficial for all the reasons we talked about before,</p>
<p>related to dopamine and acetylcholine, et cetera.</p>
<p>But it turns out that it is also the case</p>
<p>that spiking one&rsquo;s adrenaline</p>
<p>and other so-called catecholamines,</p>
<p>so this would be dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine,</p>
<p>after a bout of learning,</p>
<p>can greatly enhance memory for the information</p>
<p>that one was trying to learn.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Spiking your adrenaline after learning</p>
<p>can greatly increase memory</p>
<p>for the material you&rsquo;re trying to learn.</p>
<p>In fact, this is a practice that dates back centuries</p>
<p>and was written about</p>
<p>in a beautiful annual review of neuroscience</p>
<p>on the biology of memory by James McGaugh,</p>
<p>where he talks about medieval practices</p>
<p>of children being taught information</p>
<p>and then being thrown, literally, into cold water</p>
<p>to stimulate the release of adrenaline</p>
<p>and that increase in adrenaline,</p>
<p>while the mechanism wasn&rsquo;t completely understood,</p>
<p>it was understood that that sort of shock to the system</p>
<p>from the cold water led to better memory</p>
<p>and retention of the information</p>
<p>that these children had been exposed to.</p>
<p>And it turns out the exact same thing is true for adults</p>
<p>in the laboratory or kids in the laboratory.</p>
<p>And here, I&rsquo;m not suggesting throwing anyone</p>
<p>into cold water.</p>
<p>If you want to get into cold water,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a reason we call it deliberate cold exposure</p>
<p>on the podcast is that it should be deliberate</p>
<p>and controlled by you, not by somebody else.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s controlled by somebody else,</p>
<p>that might be military screening or something.</p>
<p>But here we&rsquo;re talking about deliberately increasing</p>
<p>your levels of adrenaline and other catecholamines,</p>
<p>dopamine, norepinephrine, et cetera.</p>
<p>You can do that certainly by deliberate cold exposure</p>
<p>with a cold shower or getting in up to your neck</p>
<p>in cold water of any kind.</p>
<p>But the other way to do that is to spike your adrenaline</p>
<p>by ingesting one to three milligrams per kilogram</p>
<p>of caffeine after sitting down</p>
<p>to try and learn some material.</p>
<p>I confess that more often than not,</p>
<p>I use caffeine the same way that most people use it,</p>
<p>which is, okay, I&rsquo;m going to sit down,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to research information for a podcast</p>
<p>or assemble some information for a paper or grant,</p>
<p>and I want to focus.</p>
<p>So I will drink a cup of coffee at the beginning of that,</p>
<p>and maybe even throughout that,</p>
<p>or a couple of yerba mate at the beginning</p>
<p>or throughout that, or I&rsquo;ll sip on one or both</p>
<p>throughout trying to learn.</p>
<p>And that works quite well in terms of maintaining focus</p>
<p>and alertness and retention of information.</p>
<p>But it is indeed the case,</p>
<p>that is the research supports the fact,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve experienced the fact,</p>
<p>that if I abstain from caffeine</p>
<p>while I&rsquo;m trying to learn something,</p>
<p>but then I drink caffeine immediately after,</p>
<p>somewhat surprisingly to me,</p>
<p>but certainly in a way that&rsquo;s consistent</p>
<p>with the research literature,</p>
<p>memory for the information that I was focused on</p>
<p>prior to ingesting that caffeine is much greater.</p>
<p>And here I&rsquo;m talking about it as a personal anecdote,</p>
<p>but this is actually what the data point to</p>
<p>both in animals and in humans.</p>
<p>And if you think about it, it makes perfect sense,</p>
<p>because the way that the memory systems</p>
<p>of the brain are organized</p>
<p>is that we go through life experiencing things,</p>
<p>we encounter surprises, both good and bad,</p>
<p>we go through the motions of things,</p>
<p>both typical, mundane, exciting,</p>
<p>and novel and not novel.</p>
<p>And then every once in a while,</p>
<p>something will happen that will spike our catecholamines,</p>
<p>dopamine, typically if it&rsquo;s a positive surprise,</p>
<p>adrenaline, which can be associated</p>
<p>with both positive surprise or positive events</p>
<p>and negative events or surprises,</p>
<p>and without fail, increases in the catecholamines</p>
<p>tend to lock in memories for things that preceded</p>
<p>the increase in those catecholamines.</p>
<p>Again, the catecholamines being dopamine,</p>
<p>epinephrine and norepinephrine,</p>
<p>sometimes all three in combination,</p>
<p>sometimes just two of those,</p>
<p>sometimes just one of those, depending on the experience.</p>
<p>So it makes perfect sense that using caffeine</p>
<p>at the end of a learning bout would enhance our memory</p>
<p>for the information that we&rsquo;re trying to learn.</p>
<p>So if you decide that you want to try and extract</p>
<p>this performance enhancing effect of caffeine,</p>
<p>what I recommend would be to try and abstain from caffeine</p>
<p>for a day or two prior,</p>
<p>but if you can&rsquo;t, to just continue</p>
<p>with your normal caffeine intake.</p>
<p>But then when you sit down to study or learn something,</p>
<p>to not ingest any caffeine as you do that,</p>
<p>but then afterward to ingest caffeine.</p>
<p>Now, in theory, you could probably further enhance</p>
<p>the memory encoding effects of adrenaline</p>
<p>and the other catecholamines by drinking caffeine</p>
<p>and then taking a cold shower,</p>
<p>doing deliberate cold exposure if you really wanted to</p>
<p>or had the ability to,</p>
<p>or doing some sort of intense form of exercise.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll talk in a moment about how caffeine exercise</p>
<p>and the adrenaline system interact.</p>
<p>But as a brief, but relevant aside,</p>
<p>brief bouts of intense exercise,</p>
<p>ranging from 10 to 50 minutes or so,</p>
<p>have been shown to improve memory for information</p>
<p>that one was trying to learn prior to the intense exercise.</p>
<p>This is work from Dr. Wendy Suzuki&rsquo;s lab at NYU,</p>
<p>as well as other laboratories.</p>
<p>Some of the work that&rsquo;s being done at Stanford</p>
<p>in the mind-body laboratories.</p>
<p>And our laboratory points in the direction</p>
<p>of these kinds of effects as well.</p>
<p>They all come back to the same general neurochemical theme,</p>
<p>which is that when we experience an increase</p>
<p>in these catecholamines that include adrenaline,</p>
<p>dopamine, and norepinephrine,</p>
<p>the memory systems of the brain flip on</p>
<p>in a way that try to capture the information</p>
<p>and the perceptions and the experiences</p>
<p>that we were exposed to just prior</p>
<p>to the increase in catecholamines and caffeine,</p>
<p>but also exercise and also cold water.</p>
<p>And of course, any of those alone or in combination</p>
<p>all increase the levels of catecholamines.</p>
<p>So it makes perfect logical mechanistic sense</p>
<p>as to why this would work.</p>
<p>And in fact, it does work.</p>
<p>If you want to remember specific information,</p>
<p>you might consider using caffeine</p>
<p>as you move through and absorb</p>
<p>and are exposed to that information,</p>
<p>but you might also consider using caffeine</p>
<p>after being exposed to that information</p>
<p>because studies in animals and humans</p>
<p>show that that is a potent way to increase memory</p>
<p>for what you were just exposed to.</p>
<p>I should mention that what I just described</p>
<p>also pushes back on something</p>
<p>that I know a number of people perhaps have heard about</p>
<p>and maybe even use, which is this notion of the nappuccino.</p>
<p>I remember hearing about this a few years back.</p>
<p>It was a sort of trend, if you will.</p>
<p>The trend involved drinking a cup of coffee</p>
<p>or double espresso and then going down for a nap,</p>
<p>typically in the afternoon, and then waking up.</p>
<p>And the idea was that the caffeine would hit your system</p>
<p>right at the time that you awake from the nap</p>
<p>and that you would be better able to focus and exercise.</p>
<p>There are a couple of things about that practice</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t like.</p>
<p>First of all, it implies in most cases</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re napping and ingesting caffeine in the afternoon,</p>
<p>which I realize for many students</p>
<p>and for people that are comfortable</p>
<p>staying up until the wee hours of the night</p>
<p>and then waking up late the next day</p>
<p>might be compatible with their schedule.</p>
<p>But again, because of the sleep</p>
<p>diminishing effects of caffeine,</p>
<p>and we talked about earlier,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not crazy about the idea of people</p>
<p>ingesting caffeine in the late afternoon</p>
<p>in order to perform better in the late afternoon.</p>
<p>Far better would be to restrict caffeine intake</p>
<p>to the early part of the day, as we talked about earlier.</p>
<p>The other reason is that the data</p>
<p>on things like non-sleep, deep rest</p>
<p>and naps in the afternoon.</p>
<p>And again, the rule here is that you don&rsquo;t have to nap,</p>
<p>but if you want to nap,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s been shown that naps of 90 minutes or less</p>
<p>or non-sleep, deep rest protocols,</p>
<p>and you can find those, for instance,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s one with me speaking,</p>
<p>you just put NSDR Huberman into YouTube,</p>
<p>you can hear that, it&rsquo;s completely zero cost.</p>
<p>There are other NSDR scripts out there now, of course,</p>
<p>that if you prefer those,</p>
<p>that those can all lead to increases</p>
<p>in one of the catecholamines at least, which is dopamine.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s been shown in a really nice</p>
<p>neurotransmitter labeling study,</p>
<p>not from my laboratory, but from another laboratory,</p>
<p>but also can improve mood focus and alertness</p>
<p>on its own without the need to ingest caffeine</p>
<p>prior to going into those states.</p>
<p>And in fact, ingesting caffeine prior to a nap</p>
<p>or ingesting caffeine prior to NSDR</p>
<p>is most certainly going to reduce the effectiveness</p>
<p>of that nap and NSDR in restoring natural levels</p>
<p>of alertness and focus that would lead</p>
<p>to the performance enhancing effect.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not such a fan of the so-called nappuccino,</p>
<p>although if any of you out there</p>
<p>have derived great benefit from it,</p>
<p>definitely let me know your protocol</p>
<p>and what you&rsquo;ve experienced.</p>
<p>Put it in the comment section, if you would.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d appreciate that.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s another very important and potent use of caffeine</p>
<p>for enhancing performance.</p>
<p>And this relates not just to the dopamine and epinephrine</p>
<p>and the arousal inducing effects of caffeine.</p>
<p>And it doesn&rsquo;t even just relate to the effect of caffeine</p>
<p>on enhancing frontal lobe function.</p>
<p>It does include all that,</p>
<p>but it also includes those reinforcing effects of caffeine</p>
<p>that we talked about at the beginning of the episode.</p>
<p>And the best way to illustrate</p>
<p>these performance enhancing effects of caffeine</p>
<p>that stem directly from its association with reinforcement</p>
<p>is to highlight a study.</p>
<p>And the title of the study is blood dopamine level</p>
<p>enhanced by caffeine in men after treadmill running.</p>
<p>And as the title suggests, this was carried out in men,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s no reason to think that the same results</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t also be present in women.</p>
<p>There are some sex dependent effects of caffeine.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll touch on just briefly at the end,</p>
<p>but those are largely present in kids.</p>
<p>That is adolescents and teens, as opposed to adults.</p>
<p>So this study is really interesting.</p>
<p>What they had people do was run on a treadmill</p>
<p>and either ingest caffeine again,</p>
<p>three milligrams per kilogram of body weight,</p>
<p>or to not ingest caffeine.</p>
<p>And then they looked at levels of dopamine</p>
<p>and other neurotransmitters and hormones,</p>
<p>such as prolactin and cortisol.</p>
<p>And the basic takeaway is, as the title suggests,</p>
<p>that exercise while on its own can increase cortisol</p>
<p>in healthy ways, provided it&rsquo;s not too intense and too long.</p>
<p>Little note here,</p>
<p>if you have trouble recovering from exercise</p>
<p>or you want to continue to derive</p>
<p>the benefits from exercise,</p>
<p>in general, best not to do high intensity exercise</p>
<p>for longer than 75 minutes or 90 minutes,</p>
<p>probably being the outer threshold.</p>
<p>I realize that there are some genetic freaks out there</p>
<p>or people that are chemically assisted</p>
<p>that can recover from very intense long bouts of exercise,</p>
<p>but most people don&rsquo;t do well</p>
<p>long bouts of intense exercise on a regular basis</p>
<p>and limiting their intense exercise to 60 minutes or less,</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t include the warmup, is going to be beneficial.</p>
<p>See the episode on a toolkit for fitness</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;d like details on that.</p>
<p>Exercise is known to increase levels of dopamine,</p>
<p>cortisol, and other catecholamines</p>
<p>and neurotransmitters very potently.</p>
<p>And things like testosterone and estrogen</p>
<p>in ways that we know are beneficial to us.</p>
<p>And of course have all these positive effects</p>
<p>on the musculoskeletal system and cardiovascular effects.</p>
<p>But unbeknownst to most people,</p>
<p>ingesting three milligrams per kilogram of caffeine</p>
<p>prior to exercise further increases the dopamine release</p>
<p>associated with exercise specifically.</p>
<p>And this has two important effects.</p>
<p>First of all, that increase in dopamine is great</p>
<p>because it provides a long lasting increase</p>
<p>in focus, alertness, and motivation,</p>
<p>not just during the exercise, but also after the exercise.</p>
<p>And second, it, that is caffeine and dopamine in combination</p>
<p>act as a reinforcer to make the experience of exercise</p>
<p>and the period immediate after exercise more pleasant</p>
<p>and in fact, reinforcing.</p>
<p>So in other words, one way to enjoy exercise more</p>
<p>and to enjoy the activities that follow exercise more</p>
<p>and to experience a genuine increase in dopamine</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s beneficial for mood and alertness</p>
<p>is to ingest caffeine prior to exercise.</p>
<p>Now, this is important because a number of people out there</p>
<p>are exercising, love exercise, love eating great,</p>
<p>love doing all the things that are beneficial</p>
<p>for their health.</p>
<p>But a number of people out there</p>
<p>really don&rsquo;t like to exercise.</p>
<p>And that serves as a serious block for their willingness</p>
<p>and their consistency to exercise.</p>
<p>Ingesting caffeine gives us energy to exercise.</p>
<p>It increases the release of neurochemicals and hormones</p>
<p>that are good for us during exercise.</p>
<p>But as I&rsquo;m highlighting here,</p>
<p>it also increases the reinforcement pathways</p>
<p>associated with exercise.</p>
<p>That is, it creates a positive feeling</p>
<p>about the general theme of engaging in exercise.</p>
<p>And it creates a general positive experience</p>
<p>of the things that follow exercise.</p>
<p>So I think this, if nothing else,</p>
<p>is a call for or support for the idea</p>
<p>that ingesting caffeine as a performance enhancing tool</p>
<p>makes perfect sense.</p>
<p>But for those out there that don&rsquo;t enjoy exercise,</p>
<p>in particular, certain forms of exercise,</p>
<p>ingesting caffeine can change your relationship</p>
<p>to that exercise.</p>
<p>In other words, make it more positive,</p>
<p>much in the same way that ingesting caffeine</p>
<p>alongside a certain taste</p>
<p>that would otherwise be neutral or maybe even negative</p>
<p>can actually make the taste of that particular drink</p>
<p>or food positive.</p>
<p>So again, this brings us back</p>
<p>to the reinforcing properties of caffeine</p>
<p>that are subconscious.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just about the enhanced performance in the test</p>
<p>or the enhanced performance on the treadmill</p>
<p>or with the weights in the gym.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s enhanced feelings of mood and wellbeing</p>
<p>that are genuine because of the effect of caffeine</p>
<p>on certain neurotransmitter and hormone systems.</p>
<p>But it also is creating an overall milieu</p>
<p>of reinforcing all of the things that led into,</p>
<p>occur during and occur after exercise.</p>
<p>I do want to point out something that&rsquo;s very important</p>
<p>as it relates to combining things like caffeine</p>
<p>and exercise in order to increase dopamine.</p>
<p>This is something that came up in the episode</p>
<p>that I did on dopamine motivation and drive,</p>
<p>which turns out to be one of our most popular episodes.</p>
<p>Again, you can find that at hubermanlab.com</p>
<p>and links to all formats with timestamps, et cetera.</p>
<p>This also came up in the episode on ADHD</p>
<p>because of the relationship between ADHD and dopamine.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s this notion of dopamine stacking.</p>
<p>In the episode on dopamine motivation and drive,</p>
<p>I pointed out that while there are a near infinite number</p>
<p>of things that can increase dopamine release,</p>
<p>most notably positive surprise or positive anticipation</p>
<p>or experiencing a win,</p>
<p>certainly there are compounds, both drugs of abuse,</p>
<p>food, sex, and certain supplements</p>
<p>that can increase dopamine to varying levels</p>
<p>and to varying degrees, both healthy and unhealthy.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all contained in that episode</p>
<p>on dopamine motivation and drive.</p>
<p>But what I pointed out is that if you are somebody</p>
<p>who tends to experience difficulty with motivation,</p>
<p>that so-called dopamine stacking, as I called it,</p>
<p>might be something that you want to avoid.</p>
<p>What is dopamine stacking?</p>
<p>Dopamine stacking would be combining</p>
<p>a highly caffeinated energy drink</p>
<p>that also includes the amino acid tyrosine,</p>
<p>which is a precursor to dopamine, plus loud music,</p>
<p>plus getting yourself really ramped up</p>
<p>then an intense workout.</p>
<p>All of that can be great if you do it every once in a while.</p>
<p>But what you will quickly find is that the extent</p>
<p>to which your dopamine peaks also dictates the extent</p>
<p>to which your dopamine will drop after that peak.</p>
<p>And when I say drop, I mean drop below baseline.</p>
<p>So a lot of people find that if they stack a lot of things</p>
<p>to peak their dopamine, that then they experience a low</p>
<p>and it does take some time for them to return to baseline.</p>
<p>And I highly recommend not engaging in activities</p>
<p>or consuming compounds that are in attempt</p>
<p>to accelerate that return to baseline</p>
<p>because all it will do is drive</p>
<p>that baseline lower and lower.</p>
<p>So this requires being able to tolerate a drop</p>
<p>in dopamine baseline for a period of time, et cetera.</p>
<p>Now, the reason I&rsquo;m bringing this up now</p>
<p>in the context of this caffeine episode</p>
<p>is I just described a study</p>
<p>in which using caffeine prior to exercise</p>
<p>increases dopamine after exercise.</p>
<p>And so you might be saying,</p>
<p>especially if you heard that earlier episode,</p>
<p>wait, isn&rsquo;t that dopamine stacking?</p>
<p>Aren&rsquo;t you encouraging me to stack my dopamine?</p>
<p>Well, in some sense, yes, but keep in mind,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not suggesting that you do this every time you exercise.</p>
<p>So just as in that earlier episode,</p>
<p>I emphasized the fact that while stacking multiple stimuli,</p>
<p>right, caffeine or energy drinks and music and et cetera,</p>
<p>for exercise or for mental work</p>
<p>or for any experience for that matter</p>
<p>is okay to do every once in a while for most people.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want to get in the habit</p>
<p>of doing it consistently every time you exercise</p>
<p>or every time you go out, for instance.</p>
<p>And so you really want to be cautious.</p>
<p>That is you want to protect your both baseline levels</p>
<p>of dopamine and your peak levels of dopamine.</p>
<p>That said, for people that want to experience</p>
<p>an increase in mood, alertness and performance</p>
<p>or who want to condition themselves</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s really what it is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s conditioning yourself</p>
<p>by the reinforcing effects of dopamine</p>
<p>to increase your liking</p>
<p>or maybe even your loving of exercise,</p>
<p>occasionally using caffeine</p>
<p>or frequently using caffeine prior to exercise is fine,</p>
<p>but be very careful.</p>
<p>And by being very careful,</p>
<p>what I mean is pay attention to how you feel</p>
<p>in the hours and days after</p>
<p>that dopamine increase wears off.</p>
<p>So for instance, if you ingest caffeine</p>
<p>and then exercise very intensely</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re feeling great afterwards,</p>
<p>but then eight hours later or the next day,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re feeling a little bit low,</p>
<p>I suggest you don&rsquo;t go back</p>
<p>and do the exact same thing right away.</p>
<p>I would give yourself a little bit of time</p>
<p>to let that baseline of dopamine return to normal.</p>
<p>So again, stacking different things,</p>
<p>chemical and behavioral in order to increase dopamine</p>
<p>can be done in a safe way that&rsquo;s beneficial to you</p>
<p>depending on your goals,</p>
<p>but be careful about not stacking too many stimuli</p>
<p>for dopamine too often, that&rsquo;s the key.</p>
<p>Early in the episode,</p>
<p>I mentioned one possible caffeine consuming schedule</p>
<p>that works very well,</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t fortunately subject you</p>
<p>to long 20 day bouts or five day</p>
<p>or even two day bouts of abstinence.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the every other day schedule of caffeine.</p>
<p>If you look at the half-life of caffeine</p>
<p>and you look at its effects on the dopamine system</p>
<p>and its performance enhancing effects</p>
<p>and how a period of abstinence</p>
<p>can in fact increase the performance</p>
<p>enhancing effects of caffeine,</p>
<p>but also take into consideration</p>
<p>that caffeine can be habit forming</p>
<p>and we can develop a sort of tolerance to caffeine.</p>
<p>Well, then what emerges from all of that</p>
<p>is that being a person who consumes caffeine</p>
<p>every other day can actually help you maximize</p>
<p>most of the positive effects of caffeine</p>
<p>without subjecting you to the kind of misery that occurs</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re accustomed to consuming caffeine every single day</p>
<p>and then suddenly go into a two or five</p>
<p>or 20 day abstinence.</p>
<p>So I myself have never tried</p>
<p>an every other day caffeine approach,</p>
<p>although I&rsquo;m considering doing it</p>
<p>based on the literature that I&rsquo;ve read.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m considering doing it in a very specific way,</p>
<p>which will be to only consume caffeine</p>
<p>on the days in which I resistance train.</p>
<p>And since I tend to do that</p>
<p>about three or four days per week</p>
<p>organized in a way that&rsquo;s every other day.</p>
<p>Again, if you want to see the exercise schedule</p>
<p>that I follow, including cardiovascular exercise</p>
<p>and weight training and all the reasons</p>
<p>and rationale for what I do</p>
<p>and how it maps onto the scientific literature</p>
<p>related to health span and life span, vitality, et cetera.</p>
<p>You can find that at hubermanlab.com.</p>
<p>And we had a toolkit for fitness</p>
<p>that ought to be posted to our website before long.</p>
<p>The every other day schedule of caffeine intake</p>
<p>to me seems like the most rational one.</p>
<p>If one wants to maximize on the performance</p>
<p>enhancing effects of caffeine</p>
<p>without suffering the effects of caffeine withdrawal</p>
<p>that are associated with being a regular consumer of caffeine</p>
<p>and then stopping caffeine intake,</p>
<p>such as headache and irritability and so forth,</p>
<p>not I nor anyone in my life</p>
<p>wants me to experience those effects.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m sure you don&rsquo;t want to experience</p>
<p>those effects for you either.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re somebody that decides to try</p>
<p>the every other day protocol,</p>
<p>or you are somebody who&rsquo;s already doing that protocol,</p>
<p>please let me know what your experiences with that are.</p>
<p>At least by my read of the literature on caffeine</p>
<p>and its performance enhancing effects,</p>
<p>but also the effects of caffeine</p>
<p>on neurotransmitter and hormone systems.</p>
<p>The every other day caffeine&rsquo;s schedule</p>
<p>does seem to be the most rational</p>
<p>and scientifically grounded one</p>
<p>in order to maximize on all those effects.</p>
<p>In addition to so-called performance enhancing effects</p>
<p>of caffeine, there are also the well-studied</p>
<p>and now fairly well mechanistically understood</p>
<p>pro-health effects of caffeine.</p>
<p>Now here, when I talk about pro-health effects of caffeine,</p>
<p>I want to be very clear that if your schedule</p>
<p>of caffeine intake, that is your timing of caffeine intake</p>
<p>or anything else for that matter,</p>
<p>offsets getting regular high quality sleep</p>
<p>of sufficient duration, well then you are undermining</p>
<p>the pro-health effects of that thing.</p>
<p>This is true for exercise, this is true for caffeine,</p>
<p>this is true for supplementation,</p>
<p>this is true for prescription drugs.</p>
<p>Again, you don&rsquo;t want to be neurotically attached</p>
<p>to the idea that you have to get perfect sleep every night</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s simply not true,</p>
<p>but it is absolutely the case that anything,</p>
<p>whether or not it&rsquo;s good for you or bad for you</p>
<p>in the short term, that disrupts your sleep</p>
<p>because of the timing in which you&rsquo;re doing that thing</p>
<p>is going to undermine your immediate</p>
<p>and long-term health before long.</p>
<p>So with that said, there are several well-described</p>
<p>health promoting effects of caffeine ingestion.</p>
<p>And once again, when I say caffeine ingestion,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m referring to that one to three milligrams per kilogram</p>
<p>of body weight dosage.</p>
<p>There are really nice studies showing</p>
<p>that being a regular consumer of caffeine</p>
<p>can help offset some of the probability,</p>
<p>some of the probability of developing Parkinson&rsquo;s</p>
<p>and maybe Alzheimer&rsquo;s related dementia as well.</p>
<p>These are not terribly controversial data</p>
<p>because of the fact that caffeine is known</p>
<p>to increase the release of those catecholamines,</p>
<p>dopamine, epinephrine, and norepinephrine,</p>
<p>as well as acetylcholine.</p>
<p>All those neurotransmitter and neuromodulator systems</p>
<p>are the ones that are known to be defective</p>
<p>in Parkinson&rsquo;s and Alzheimer&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>although there are other transmitter and hormone systems</p>
<p>that are defective as well.</p>
<p>There are beautiful reviews on the neuroprotective effects</p>
<p>of caffeine and neurodegenerative diseases.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re quite extensive.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll just refer you to one and the references therein,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll provide a link to this in the show note captions.</p>
<p>So the title as the topic at hand suggests</p>
<p>is the Neuroprotective Effects of Caffeine</p>
<p>and Neurodegenerative Diseases.</p>
<p>This was published in 2016.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;ve been other reviews since then,</p>
<p>but it includes many, many quality references</p>
<p>and studies both in animals and in humans</p>
<p>pointing to the fact that specific enzymes</p>
<p>that are associated with the health</p>
<p>of in particular dopamine neurons</p>
<p>are made more robust by regular ingestion of caffeine.</p>
<p>It also points to the fact</p>
<p>that the increase in dopamine receptors</p>
<p>that is induced by regular ingestion of caffeine</p>
<p>that I referred to earlier</p>
<p>is another way in which dopamine,</p>
<p>however many dopamine neurons remain around</p>
<p>in people with Parkinson&rsquo;s or people who are aging</p>
<p>that lose dopamine neurons naturally,</p>
<p>that dopamine can have its maximal effect</p>
<p>because of the increase in receptors for dopamine</p>
<p>that caffeine induces.</p>
<p>And there are other biological mechanisms</p>
<p>that further support why caffeine</p>
<p>ought to be neuroprotective,</p>
<p>including its effects on the acetylcholine system,</p>
<p>which is one of the major systems</p>
<p>disrupted in Alzheimer&rsquo;s dementia.</p>
<p>So in other words, it makes perfect sense</p>
<p>as to why caffeine would be neuroprotective.</p>
<p>Caffeine has also been shown to diminish headache,</p>
<p>particularly when taken in combination with aspirin.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because of the effects of caffeine</p>
<p>and aspirin on blood flow.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also evidence that caffeine can provide brief</p>
<p>but substantial relief from asthma.</p>
<p>So I wouldn&rsquo;t want people to rely on caffeine</p>
<p>as a life saving approach to an asthmatic attack.</p>
<p>That said, for people that suffer from minor asthma,</p>
<p>that caffeine intake, again, of the dosages</p>
<p>that we talked about before,</p>
<p>has been shown to alleviate some of the major symptoms</p>
<p>of asthma for anywhere from one to four hours.</p>
<p>And I know this is of relevance</p>
<p>to a lot of people out there.</p>
<p>Because caffeine increases the catecholamines,</p>
<p>and in particular because caffeine increases</p>
<p>dopamine transmission in the prefrontal cortex,</p>
<p>this area of the brain associated with focus</p>
<p>and rule setting and context and task switching,</p>
<p>caffeine is known to improve focus and alertness,</p>
<p>in particular in people who have symptoms of ADHD</p>
<p>or other attention and focus issues.</p>
<p>Now, caffeine alone does not appear to be as potent</p>
<p>for the treatment of ADHD as are things like</p>
<p>ritalin, Adderall, modafinil and armodafinil and Vyvanse.</p>
<p>If you would like a sort of head-by-head comparison</p>
<p>of prescription drugs, supplements and things like caffeine,</p>
<p>as well as coverage of behavioral tools</p>
<p>and nutritional tools, et cetera,</p>
<p>that can positively offset some of the symptoms of ADHD,</p>
<p>please see the episode that I did on ADHD.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s available at hubermanlab.com in all formats.</p>
<p>But that said, caffeine does increase focus</p>
<p>and it does it through a number of different mechanisms,</p>
<p>not the least of which is to increase dopamine transmission</p>
<p>in the forebrain,</p>
<p>just as a drug like ritalin or Adderall would,</p>
<p>although not to the same extent</p>
<p>as a drug like ritalin or Adderall does.</p>
<p>Before we close today,</p>
<p>I do want to just briefly return</p>
<p>to the reinforcing effects of caffeine</p>
<p>that we talked about earlier.</p>
<p>This study on the honeybees that showed that</p>
<p>bees prefer certain nectars because they contain caffeine,</p>
<p>even though they are not aware</p>
<p>that those nectars contain caffeine.</p>
<p>They just come to like the feeling</p>
<p>that those nectars provide them so much</p>
<p>that they associate that in a subconscious way</p>
<p>with the flowers themselves</p>
<p>and they come to like those flowers.</p>
<p>Or human beings, for instance,</p>
<p>children that ingest caffeinated beverages</p>
<p>come to adore the taste of those beverages.</p>
<p>And beautiful studies have been done</p>
<p>that describe how children and adults</p>
<p>truly cannot distinguish between the taste</p>
<p>of a caffeinated and non-caffeinated beverage.</p>
<p>And caffeine can be placed into essentially any beverage</p>
<p>in order to give us a preference for that beverage or food.</p>
<p>In fact, the studies have been done with yogurt.</p>
<p>If you put caffeine into yogurt of different flavors,</p>
<p>even plain yogurt, which most kids don&rsquo;t like,</p>
<p>they will come to prefer</p>
<p>whatever flavor contain the caffeine,</p>
<p>even if then you remove the caffeine from that flavor.</p>
<p>Now, eventually their preference</p>
<p>for that flavor will be extinguished.</p>
<p>But all of this is just to say</p>
<p>that so many of the things that we like,</p>
<p>whether or not it&rsquo;s coffee or tea</p>
<p>or a given flavor of food or given experience</p>
<p>or even exercise occur</p>
<p>because we ingest caffeine in conjunction</p>
<p>with those activities.</p>
<p>Now, these are not tricks</p>
<p>that your nervous system plays on you.</p>
<p>These are real neurochemical reinforcing effects.</p>
<p>And I think that we would all do well to think about</p>
<p>and to leverage these reinforcing effects</p>
<p>much in the same way we would do well to think about</p>
<p>and hopefully not leverage aversive effects</p>
<p>of certain compounds, right?</p>
<p>The simple way to put this is,</p>
<p>I or anyone could get you to dislike something,</p>
<p>someone or some place</p>
<p>by making you feel slightly less good, lower mood.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even have to make you feel nauseous,</p>
<p>but less good after ingesting something</p>
<p>or having a certain kind of interaction</p>
<p>or being in a certain environment.</p>
<p>Very straightforward to do that</p>
<p>because of the way that your nervous system</p>
<p>is wired for conditioning.</p>
<p>However, there&rsquo;s the positive side of all this,</p>
<p>which is that it&rsquo;s very straightforward</p>
<p>to reinforce the experience of a given food,</p>
<p>including its taste, but all the context around it,</p>
<p>the container, the texture,</p>
<p>the people you consume it with,</p>
<p>where you consume it, et cetera.</p>
<p>For instance, I wonder why we are not pairing caffeine</p>
<p>with broccoli.</p>
<p>And here, I&rsquo;m not suggesting</p>
<p>that people actually do that experiment</p>
<p>or play that trick on people.</p>
<p>But you have to sort of imagine</p>
<p>that if caffeine is this incredible reinforcer</p>
<p>of all sorts of things,</p>
<p>in particular things that we ingest</p>
<p>and would want to ingest more of</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s paired with caffeine,</p>
<p>well, then you actually can use caffeine</p>
<p>as a tool to increase reinforcement of different things.</p>
<p>And you can avoid caffeine</p>
<p>as a way to further reinforce things</p>
<p>that you would like to stop.</p>
<p>And here, I&rsquo;d like to just give the example</p>
<p>of sugar cravings.</p>
<p>A lot of people ask me,</p>
<p>how do I avoid sugar cravings?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked about the use of L-glutamine for that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked about making sure you&rsquo;re getting enough</p>
<p>essential fatty acids and essential amino acids</p>
<p>as a way to reduce sugar cravings.</p>
<p>Please note, however,</p>
<p>that if you are somebody who likes to have your sugar,</p>
<p>whether or not it&rsquo;s a piece of chocolate</p>
<p>or your dessert, et cetera,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying that&rsquo;s bad,</p>
<p>but if you&rsquo;re trying to reduce your sugar cravings,</p>
<p>ask yourself, are you ingesting sugar along with caffeine?</p>
<p>Could be the caffeine contained</p>
<p>in that sugar-containing food like chocolate,</p>
<p>or it could be that you&rsquo;re having a cup of coffee</p>
<p>along with your pastry,</p>
<p>and then you&rsquo;re struggling with sugar cravings.</p>
<p>Well, think about it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not just being reinforced by the sugar</p>
<p>and the effects of sugar on dopamine,</p>
<p>which are real and both conscious and subconscious</p>
<p>through the gut-to-the-brain dopamine system</p>
<p>and direct-on-the-brain dopamine system,</p>
<p>but by co-ingesting caffeine,</p>
<p>you are also further enhancing</p>
<p>the reinforcing effects of sugar.</p>
<p>The flip side to all of this is that you could use caffeine</p>
<p>as a way to increase your appetite for certain things.</p>
<p>I actually know somebody,</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t reveal who this person is,</p>
<p>but they are quite prominent podcaster</p>
<p>who ingests 125 to 150 milligrams of caffeine</p>
<p>in tablet form, in tablet form,</p>
<p>along with herbal tea and use this as a way</p>
<p>to develop a preference for herbal tea</p>
<p>because they found that coffee was giving them other effects</p>
<p>that weren&rsquo;t good for them.</p>
<p>So it works quite well in animals,</p>
<p>and it works quite well in insects,</p>
<p>and it works quite well in humans.</p>
<p>I suppose animals, insects, and humans</p>
<p>are all animals at the end of the day,</p>
<p>so no surprise there,</p>
<p>but it all underscores the extent</p>
<p>to which caffeine is an absolutely fascinating molecule.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s an ability to offset the sleepiness system,</p>
<p>if you will, this adenosine system,</p>
<p>and to control our schedules in that way,</p>
<p>to essentially take a withdrawal against the bank</p>
<p>that is adenosine and then pay that back later</p>
<p>in the form of getting sleepy later</p>
<p>as opposed to when we want to be alert.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s ability to enhance focus, alertness, and mood,</p>
<p>and if taken after trying to learn something</p>
<p>and remember it to enhance memory especially,</p>
<p>and its ability to increase VO2 max, increase strength.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t even talk today about it,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ll just briefly mention that caffeine ingested</p>
<p>in the sorts of doses we talked about earlier</p>
<p>because its effects on the neuromuscular system</p>
<p>and the calcium system associated</p>
<p>with neuromuscular exertion and fatigue</p>
<p>can increase peak power output and muscle contractibility.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s enhancing performance there as well.</p>
<p>And of course, caffeine does a number of other things</p>
<p>just generally related to our overall</p>
<p>and basal level of mood and alertness,</p>
<p>not the least of which are these increases in dopamine.</p>
<p>So caffeine is really an incredible molecule.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s affecting all these various neurotransmitter systems,</p>
<p>but not haphazardly.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s increasing dopamine and acetylcholine</p>
<p>in the forebrain to increase attention.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s reducing fatigue.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s improving mental and physical performance</p>
<p>for some obvious and some not so obvious reasons.</p>
<p>And what I think is among the more miraculous</p>
<p>and powerful effects of caffeine,</p>
<p>it is a potent, potent, potent reinforcer</p>
<p>of things, foods, people, and experiences.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s one that you can leverage</p>
<p>in any direction that you like</p>
<p>once you understand the way that caffeine</p>
<p>exerts those reinforcing properties.</p>
<p>So today I&rsquo;ve really tried to cover as much as I could</p>
<p>about the mechanisms of caffeine action</p>
<p>in the brain and body,</p>
<p>as well as tools and schedules and dosages</p>
<p>in which you can leverage caffeine</p>
<p>in order to meet your physical performance,</p>
<p>mental performance, and frankly,</p>
<p>mental health and overall health goals.</p>
