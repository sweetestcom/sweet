    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>where we discuss science</p>
<p>and science-based tools for everyday life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Andrew Huberman,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology</p>
<p>at Stanford School of Medicine.</p>
<p>Today, we&rsquo;re discussing alcohol,</p>
<p>one of the most commonly consumed substances</p>
<p>on the planet Earth.</p>
<p>Should mention that both humans</p>
<p>and non-human animals consume alcohol</p>
<p>either for recreational purposes</p>
<p>because they like the feeling that it gives them</p>
<p>or for medicinal purposes</p>
<p>or for other purposes that we&rsquo;ll discuss.</p>
<p>We are of course going to discuss the effects of alcohol</p>
<p>on our biology,</p>
<p>ranging from its effects on individual cells,</p>
<p>on organs and organ systems in our brain and body.</p>
<p>We are also going to discuss the effects</p>
<p>of the effects of alcohol.</p>
<p>That is what being inebriated really does</p>
<p>to our thinking and our behavior and how it does it.</p>
<p>And we are going to address</p>
<p>what seems to be one of the more common questions out there,</p>
<p>which is whether or not low to moderate amounts of drinking</p>
<p>are better for our health</p>
<p>than zero alcohol consumption at all.</p>
<p>And of course, we will talk about</p>
<p>severe alcohol intake, binge drinking.</p>
<p>We will also talk about hangover</p>
<p>and what science says about ways</p>
<p>to reduce the effects of hangover,</p>
<p>either by doing things that are inoculatory,</p>
<p>meaning before you drink or while you drink,</p>
<p>as well as things to do if you happen to have a hangover.</p>
<p>We will discuss some of the genetic differences</p>
<p>for alcohol and alcoholism.</p>
<p>And we will discuss alcohol consumption in young people</p>
<p>and how that can be especially detrimental</p>
<p>for reasons that I think are going to be</p>
<p>quite surprising to most of you.</p>
<p>My goal is that by the end of today&rsquo;s episode,</p>
<p>you will have a thorough understanding</p>
<p>of what alcohol does to your brain and body</p>
<p>and that you will be able to make informed decisions</p>
<p>as to whether or not you should be consuming zero,</p>
<p>absolutely no alcohol,</p>
<p>small to moderate amounts of alcohol.</p>
<p>And again, we&rsquo;ll define exactly what that means,</p>
<p>small to moderate amounts.</p>
<p>And if you or somebody else that you know</p>
<p>is consuming excessive amounts of alcohol</p>
<p>that are clearly detrimental to your health,</p>
<p>some of the better routes and resources that you can use</p>
<p>in order to remove that dependence and or consumption.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to preface all of that by saying</p>
<p>that today&rsquo;s discussion is really geared</p>
<p>toward giving you information.</p>
<p>It is not about judging alcohol intake</p>
<p>or lack of alcohol intake.</p>
<p>I just want you to be able to make</p>
<p>the most informed decision about alcohol possible.</p>
<p>Before we get into today&rsquo;s content in detail,</p>
<p>I just want to answer a commonly asked question</p>
<p>about alcohol consumption and the brain.</p>
<p>And the question that so often comes up</p>
<p>is whether or not low to moderate amounts of alcohol,</p>
<p>so maybe one drink a day</p>
<p>or one or two drinks a day kind of thing,</p>
<p>whether or not that is bad for your brain,</p>
<p>in particular, whether or not it causes degeneration</p>
<p>of neurons or nerve cells.</p>
<p>Now, the reason that question comes up so often</p>
<p>is because for many years,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s been known that high levels of alcohol consumption,</p>
<p>so 12 to 24 drinks per week or more,</p>
<p>is certainly causing neurodegeneration,</p>
<p>in particular, of the so-called neocortex,</p>
<p>the outer layers of the brain</p>
<p>that house associative memories,</p>
<p>that house our ability to think and plan,</p>
<p>that house our ability to regulate our more primitive drives</p>
<p>according to context, et cetera.</p>
<p>So to make very clear, drinking a lot,</p>
<p>so having three or four drinks per night</p>
<p>every night of the week is clearly bad for the brain.</p>
<p>A recent study, however, finally addressed the question</p>
<p>of whether or not low to moderate amounts</p>
<p>of alcohol consumption can cause brain degeneration.</p>
<p>The title of the study is</p>
<p>Associations Between Alcohol Consumption</p>
<p>and Gray and White Matter Volumes in the UK Biobank,</p>
<p>the United Kingdom Biobank.</p>
<p>First of all, gray matter are the neurons,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the so-called cell bodies</p>
<p>that house the genome of the cells, et cetera,</p>
<p>and white matter is the connections, the fibers,</p>
<p>the so-called axons of neurons.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s called white matter</p>
<p>because that tissue is surrounded by a fatty tissue</p>
<p>called myelin, which allows nerve cells</p>
<p>to communicate with each other very quickly.</p>
<p>So what this study did is it looked at the brains,</p>
<p>both the gray matter and the white matter,</p>
<p>of more than 30,000 and even more than 35,000</p>
<p>generally healthy middle-aged and older adults</p>
<p>in the United Kingdom</p>
<p>who were drinking various amounts of alcohol.</p>
<p>What they found was that even for people</p>
<p>that were drinking low to moderate amounts of alcohol,</p>
<p>so one or two drinks per day,</p>
<p>there was evidence of thinning of the neocortex,</p>
<p>so loss of neurons in the neocortex,</p>
<p>and other brain regions.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t say this in order to cause alarm,</p>
<p>I tell you this because they are important data</p>
<p>because they reveal and indeed answer the question</p>
<p>that has been burning for so long</p>
<p>as to whether or not chronic alcohol intake</p>
<p>can disrupt the brain,</p>
<p>even if the chronic intake is very low.</p>
<p>Now we should talk about what the word chronic means</p>
<p>because many people, when they hear the word chronic,</p>
<p>think high levels of whatever intake, okay?</p>
<p>So they think five drinks a night or 10 drinks a night</p>
<p>or people drinking every night.</p>
<p>Now in this study, they looked at people who on average</p>
<p>were drinking one or two drinks per night.</p>
<p>So that could be 14 drinks on the weekend,</p>
<p>it could be one drink per night,</p>
<p>it could be seven drinks on Friday.</p>
<p>In other words, on average, one or two drinks per night.</p>
<p>And I think many people out there are drinking</p>
<p>somewhere between one and two drinks per night</p>
<p>or day of the week on average,</p>
<p>so that would be seven to 14 drinks per week.</p>
<p>So this is an important study</p>
<p>because it says that if you&rsquo;re consuming</p>
<p>even just seven glasses of wine across the week,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s likely that there is going to be some degeneration</p>
<p>of your brain in response to that alcohol intake.</p>
<p>Although, as mentioned earlier,</p>
<p>we will talk about some of the things that can inoculate</p>
<p>against some of that neuronal loss.</p>
<p>For those of you that are interested</p>
<p>in reading the study in more detail,</p>
<p>we put a link to it in the show note captions.</p>
<p>Before we begin, I&rsquo;d like to emphasize that this podcast</p>
<p>is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.</p>
<p>It is however, part of my desire and effort</p>
<p>to bring zero cost to consumer information about science</p>
<p>and science related tools to the general public.</p>
<p>In keeping with that theme,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank the sponsors of today&rsquo;s podcast.</p>
<p>Our first sponsor is Element.</p>
<p>Element is an electrolyte drink with everything you need</p>
<p>and nothing you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>That means plenty of salt, magnesium and potassium,</p>
<p>the so-called electrolytes and no sugar.</p>
<p>Now, salt, magnesium and potassium are critical</p>
<p>to the function of all the cells in your body,</p>
<p>in particular to the function of your nerve cells,</p>
<p>also called neurons.</p>
<p>In fact, in order for your neurons to function properly,</p>
<p>all three electrolytes need to be present</p>
<p>in the proper ratios.</p>
<p>And we now know that even slight reductions</p>
<p>in electrolyte concentrations or dehydration of the body</p>
<p>can lead to deficits in cognitive and physical performance.</p>
<p>Element contains a science-backed electrolyte ratio</p>
<p>of 1000 milligrams, that&rsquo;s one gram of sodium,</p>
<p>200 milligrams of potassium and 60 milligrams of magnesium.</p>
<p>I typically drink Element first thing in the morning</p>
<p>when I wake up in order to hydrate my body</p>
<p>and make sure I have enough electrolytes.</p>
<p>And while I do any kind of physical training</p>
<p>and after physical training as well,</p>
<p>especially if I&rsquo;ve been sweating a lot,</p>

<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Thesis.</p>
<p>Thesis makes what are called nootropics,</p>
<p>which means smart drugs.</p>
<p>Now, to be honest, I am not a fan of the term nootropics.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe in smart drugs in the sense that</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe that there&rsquo;s any one substance</p>
<p>or collection of substances that can make us smarter.</p>
<p>I do believe based on science, however,</p>
<p>that there are particular neural circuits</p>
<p>and brain functions that allow us to be more focused,</p>
<p>more alert, access creativity, be more motivated, et cetera.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just the way that the brain works,</p>
<p>different neural circuits for different brain states.</p>
<p>Thesis understands this.</p>
<p>And as far as I know, they&rsquo;re the first nootropics company</p>
<p>to create targeted nootropics for specific outcomes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Thesis for more than six months now,</p>
<p>and I can confidently say that their nootropics</p>
<p>have been a total game changer.</p>
<p>My go-to formula is the clarity formula,</p>
<p>or sometimes I&rsquo;ll use their energy formula before training.</p>
<p>To get your own personalized nootropic starter kit,</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m pleased to announce that the Huberman Lab Podcast</p>
<p>is now partnered with Momentus Supplements.</p>
<p>We partnered with Momentus for several important reasons.</p>
<p>First of all, they ship internationally</p>
<p>because we know that many of you</p>
<p>are located outside of the United States.</p>
<p>Second of all, and perhaps most important,</p>
<p>the quality of their supplements is second to none,</p>
<p>both in terms of purity and precision</p>
<p>of the amounts of the ingredients.</p>
<p>Third, we&rsquo;ve really emphasized supplements</p>
<p>that are single ingredient supplements,</p>
<p>and that are supplied in dosages</p>
<p>that allow you to build a supplementation protocol</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for cost,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for effectiveness,</p>
<p>and that you can add things and remove things</p>
<p>from your protocol in a way</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really systematic and scientific.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to see the supplements</p>
<p>that we partner with Momentus on,</p>
<p>you can go to livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>There you&rsquo;ll see those supplements,</p>
<p>and just keep in mind that we are constantly expanding</p>
<p>the library of supplements available through Momentus</p>
<p>on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about alcohol,</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s just acknowledge that human beings</p>
<p>have been consuming alcohol for thousands of years.</p>
<p>If you look at the archeological evidence from Mesopotamia,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll find that 5,000 years ago, people had wine vessels,</p>
<p>or if you want to know when people</p>
<p>first started distilling alcohol,</p>
<p>much to people&rsquo;s surprise,</p>
<p>that did not first take place in Ireland,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s not a joke about the Irish,</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ll see a lot of claims online</p>
<p>that the Irish were the first to distill alcohol,</p>
<p>but in fact, they were not.</p>
<p>It was the Chinese that were the first to distill alcohol,</p>
<p>and that took place in China in the first century.</p>
<p>Alcohol has been used for nutritional purposes,</p>
<p>so there are cultures that believe,</p>
<p>and indeed still believe,</p>
<p>that the calories in alcohol are useful,</p>
<p>although later we&rsquo;ll talk about how alcohol calories</p>
<p>are indeed empty calories</p>
<p>and what an empty calorie really is,</p>
<p>why it&rsquo;s called empty.</p>
<p>Alcohol has been used for medicinal purposes,</p>
<p>because indeed it does kill bacteria,</p>
<p>and as you&rsquo;ll soon find out,</p>
<p>the fact that it kills bacteria,</p>
<p>because that is absolutely true,</p>
<p>it also kills the good bacteria in your gut,</p>
<p>and the destruction of that good bacteria in your gut</p>
<p>can lead to things like leaky gut syndrome,</p>
<p>and has all sorts of issues,</p>
<p>and there are ways to deal with those issues,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll talk about those.</p>
<p>So alcohol has been used for medicinal purposes,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s been used to clean surfaces,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s used in my laboratory</p>
<p>in order to make up so-called reagents</p>
<p>to do our experiments,</p>
<p>but most humans have been consuming alcohol</p>
<p>in order to change their internal state,</p>
<p>in order to feel differently than they would otherwise.</p>
<p>That feeling of being drunk, or inebriated,</p>
<p>or tipsy, or lightheaded,</p>
<p>is something that many, not all,</p>
<p>but many humans seem to enjoy and pursue,</p>
<p>even though typically it leads to a feeling</p>
<p>of being less happy, less motivated,</p>
<p>more stressed, et cetera, when the alcohol wears off.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s pretty incredible, right?</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;re talking about a substance</p>
<p>that people have been highly motivated to pursue,</p>
<p>that are still highly motivated to pursue,</p>
<p>to create and to consume, that they&rsquo;ll spend money on,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s despite the fact that it makes them feel good,</p>
<p>and then it makes them feel lousy.</p>
<p>Now, some of you might be saying,</p>
<p>well, I drink, but I don&rsquo;t drink to excess,</p>
<p>and therefore I don&rsquo;t feel lousy,</p>
<p>I feel good when I drink, and then it wears off,</p>
<p>and it allows me to get through my evening,</p>
<p>and then the next morning I&rsquo;m ready to go.</p>
<p>Okay, that very well may be true.</p>
<p>I believe those people.</p>
<p>And as I mentioned at the beginning of the episode,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not here to demonize alcohol in any way,</p>
<p>but I do want to point out what alcohol is,</p>
<p>and how it creates the effects that it does.</p>
<p>And then I want to talk about what those effects are</p>
<p>when you engage in consuming alcohol,</p>
<p>even as often as one or two nights per week,</p>
<p>or let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re just somebody</p>
<p>who has a drink or two on Friday,</p>
<p>maybe a few more on Saturday,</p>
<p>or maybe you&rsquo;re somebody who consumes all your alcohol</p>
<p>one night per week or one night per month.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll talk about how that&rsquo;s affecting your biology.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s address what alcohol is,</p>
<p>and how it affects the cells and tissues</p>
<p>and organs of your body.</p>
<p>Then we&rsquo;ll take a look at some of the epidemiology,</p>
<p>that is how many people are consuming alcohol,</p>
<p>and how much they&rsquo;re drinking.</p>
<p>And then you will be able, I think,</p>
<p>to get a good sense of how the alcohol that you&rsquo;re drinking,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re drinking any at all,</p>
<p>is impacting your brain and body,</p>
<p>and the choices you might want to make</p>
<p>about how and when to drink alcohol,</p>
<p>or even if you want to eliminate alcohol altogether.</p>
<p>Okay, so some basic chemistry and biology of alcohol.</p>
<p>And again, I&rsquo;ll make this very clear,</p>
<p>even if you don&rsquo;t have a chemistry and biology background.</p>
<p>Because of the structure of alcohol,</p>
<p>it is what&rsquo;s called both water-soluble and fat-soluble.</p>
<p>Translated into what&rsquo;s meaningful for you,</p>
<p>what that means is when you drink alcohol,</p>
<p>it can pass into all the cells and tissues of your body.</p>
<p>It has no trouble just passing right into those cells.</p>
<p>So unlike a lot of substances and drugs</p>
<p>that actually attach to the surface of cells,</p>
<p>to receptors as they&rsquo;re called, little parking spots,</p>
<p>and then trigger a bunch of downstreams,</p>
<p>like domino cascades of effects,</p>
<p>alcohol actually has its own direct effects on cells</p>
<p>because it can really just pass into those cells.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s water and fat-soluble.</p>
<p>And the fact that it can pass</p>
<p>into so many organs and cells so easily</p>
<p>is really what explains its damaging effects.</p>
<p>I should mention that there are three main types of alcohol.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s isopropyl, methyl, and ethyl alcohol.</p>
<p>And only the last one, ethyl alcohol or ethanol,</p>
<p>is fit for human consumption.</p>
<p>However, it is still toxic, okay?</p>
<p>It produces substantial stress and damage to cells.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to be able to tell you otherwise,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s just a fact.</p>
<p>Ethanol produces substantial damage to cells.</p>
<p>And it does that because when you ingest ethanol,</p>
<p>it has to be converted into something else</p>
<p>because it is toxic to the body.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a molecule inside of all of us called NAD.</p>
<p>And you may have heard of NAD because it&rsquo;s quite popular.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of discussion about NAD</p>
<p>in the longevity literature right now.</p>
<p>NAD is present in all our cells from birth until death.</p>
<p>The levels of NAD tend to go down across the lifespan.</p>
<p>There are ideas that increasing levels of NAD</p>
<p>may extend lifespan.</p>
<p>A lot of that is still controversial,</p>
<p>or at least we should say is ongoing</p>
<p>in terms of the research.</p>
<p>But nonetheless, when you ingest ethanol,</p>
<p>NAD and related biochemical pathways</p>
<p>are involved in converting that ethanol</p>
<p>into something called acetyl aldehyde.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s broken down into acetyl aldehyde.</p>
<p>And if you thought ethanol was bad,</p>
<p>acetyl aldehyde is particularly bad.</p>
<p>Acetyl aldehyde is poison.</p>
<p>It will kill cells.</p>
<p>It damages and kills cells.</p>
<p>And it is indiscriminate as to which cells</p>
<p>it damages and kills.</p>
<p>Now, that&rsquo;s a problem, obviously.</p>
<p>And the body deals with that problem</p>
<p>by using another component of the NAD biochemical pathway</p>
<p>to convert acetyl aldehyde into something called acetate.</p>
<p>Acetate is actually something</p>
<p>that your body can use as fuel.</p>
<p>And that process of going from ethanol</p>
<p>to acetyl aldehyde to acetate</p>
<p>does involve the production of a toxic molecule, right?</p>
<p>Again, acetyl aldehyde is really toxic.</p>
<p>And NAD, and if we want to get technical,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the NAD to NADH ratio.</p>
<p>And that chemical step is the rate-limiting step</p>
<p>to ethanol&rsquo;s metabolism.</p>
<p>What does that mean for you?</p>
<p>What that means is that if your body</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t do this conversion of ethanol to acetyl aldehyde</p>
<p>to acetate fast enough,</p>
<p>well, acetyl aldehyde will build up in your body</p>
<p>and cause more damage.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s important that your body be able</p>
<p>to do this conversion very quickly.</p>
<p>And the place where it does that is within the liver.</p>
<p>And cells within the liver are very good</p>
<p>at this conversion process.</p>
<p>But they are cells and they are exposed</p>
<p>to the acetyl aldehyde in the conversion process.</p>
<p>And so cells within the liver really take a beating</p>
<p>in the alcohol metabolism events.</p>
<p>So the key thing to understand here</p>
<p>is that when you ingest alcohol,</p>
<p>you are, yes, ingesting a poison.</p>
<p>And that poison is converted</p>
<p>into an even worse poison in your body.</p>
<p>And some percentage of that worse poison</p>
<p>is converted into a form of calories</p>
<p>that you can use to generate energy, generate ATP.</p>
<p>And the reason why alcohol is considered empty calories</p>
<p>is because that entire process is very metabolically costly,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s no real nutritive value</p>
<p>of the calories that it creates.</p>
<p>You can use it for immediate energy,</p>
<p>but it can&rsquo;t be stored in any kind of meaningful</p>
<p>or beneficial way.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t provide any vitamins.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t provide any amino acids.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t provide any fatty acids.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s truly empty calories.</p>
<p>I know some people talk about sugar is empty calories,</p>
<p>but sugar actually is a far better fuel source</p>
<p>than alcohol or acetate.</p>
<p>But nonetheless, when you ingest alcohol,</p>
<p>some percentage is being shuttled into a worse poison</p>
<p>and some is being shuttled into a fuel source.</p>
<p>Now, the important thing to understand</p>
<p>is that it is the poison, the acetyl aldehyde itself,</p>
<p>that leads to the effect of being inebriated or drunk.</p>
<p>I think most people don&rsquo;t realize that,</p>
<p>that being drunk is actually a poison-induced disruption</p>
<p>in the way that your neural circuits work.</p>
<p>And so we should ask ourselves, which neural circuits,</p>
<p>what brain areas, what body areas involved</p>
<p>in feeling drunk or inebriated?</p>
<p>Now, in thinking about this state of being tipsy or happy</p>
<p>or really drunk or a little bit drunk,</p>
<p>I want to mention something</p>
<p>I think most people aren&rsquo;t aware of.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the fact that for people</p>
<p>that are regular drinkers</p>
<p>or that have a genetic predisposition to alcoholism,</p>
<p>when they drink, they tend to feel very energized</p>
<p>and very good for longer periods of time.</p>
<p>Again, people have a genetic predisposition to alcohol</p>
<p>or people who are chronic drinkers, or even just,</p>
<p>if you recall, chronic doesn&rsquo;t have to mean a ton of alcohol,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re drinking one or two per night</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;re every other night type drinkers</p>
<p>or Thursday through Sunday drinkers.</p>
<p>Those people typically experience an increase</p>
<p>in alertness and mood when they drink,</p>
<p>whereas occasional drinkers will have a briefer,</p>
<p>meaning less long-lasting period of feeling good</p>
<p>when they drink and then more quickly transition</p>
<p>into a state in which they&rsquo;re tired</p>
<p>or they start losing motor skills,</p>
<p>they start slurring their speech.</p>
<p>I also want to emphasize this is distinct from tolerance.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll talk about tolerance later</p>
<p>and exactly what tolerance means.</p>
<p>But I really want to highlight the fact</p>
<p>that when people ingest this poison,</p>
<p>because indeed it is poison,</p>
<p>the range of effects is very different</p>
<p>and you can reliably predict who are the people</p>
<p>with a predisposition to alcoholism</p>
<p>and who are the people who are more regular drinkers</p>
<p>by the contour, the timing of the different effects.</p>
<p>And again, people who tend to feel more alert and excited</p>
<p>every time they drink, they tend to get a real lift,</p>
<p>they become kind of the life of the party</p>
<p>and that lasts a long while.</p>
<p>Those people are the ones that really have to be careful</p>
<p>about predisposition for alcoholism.</p>
<p>And those people also need to be careful</p>
<p>about their drinking and the amount of drinking</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re doing,</p>
<p>even if they&rsquo;re not full-blown alcoholics.</p>
<p>Now, of course, people who are ingesting alcohol,</p>
<p>who are not accustomed to drink alcohol</p>
<p>have to be concerned about drinking alcohol</p>
<p>for other reasons because it can impair motor function</p>
<p>and judgment, et cetera.</p>
<p>But in thinking about the biochemical effects of alcohol</p>
<p>and what it&rsquo;s doing to the body,</p>
<p>what it&rsquo;s doing in all cases</p>
<p>is it&rsquo;s consumed into the gut, right?</p>
<p>Goes into the stomach.</p>
<p>The liver immediately starts this conversion</p>
<p>that we talked about before</p>
<p>of ethanol to acetyl aldehyde to acetate.</p>
<p>And some amount of acetyl aldehyde and acetate</p>
<p>are making it into the brain.</p>
<p>It crosses the blood-brain barrier.</p>
<p>Again, the brain has this fence around it</p>
<p>that we call the blood-brain barrier or the BBB.</p>
<p>Many things, most things, thankfully,</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t pass across the blood-brain barrier,</p>
<p>but alcohol, because it&rsquo;s water and fat soluble,</p>
<p>just cruises right across this fence</p>
<p>and into the milieu, the environment of the brain,</p>
<p>which is made up of a couple of different major cell types,</p>
<p>neurons, nerve cells, and so-called glial cells,</p>
<p>which are in between the nerve cells.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll talk about the effects on each of those soon.</p>
<p>So what happens when alcohol gets into the brain</p>
<p>that makes us feel tipsy or drunk?</p>
<p>And in some people, makes people feel really,</p>
<p>especially energized and happy.</p>
<p>Well, alcohol is indiscriminate</p>
<p>in terms of which brain areas it goes to.</p>
<p>Again, it doesn&rsquo;t bind to particular receptors,</p>
<p>but it does seem to have a propensity</p>
<p>or an affinity for particular brain areas</p>
<p>that are involved in certain kinds of thinking and behavior.</p>
<p>So one of the first things that happens</p>
<p>is that there&rsquo;s a slight,</p>
<p>at least after the first drink or second drink,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a slight suppression in the activity of neurons</p>
<p>in the prefrontal cortex.</p>
<p>This is an area of your neocortex</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s involved in thinking and planning,</p>
<p>and perhaps above all,</p>
<p>in suppression of impulsive behavior.</p>
<p>So if you go to a party and they&rsquo;re serving alcohol</p>
<p>and people are consuming drinks,</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;ll notice is that a few minutes into that party,</p>
<p>the volume of people&rsquo;s voices will increase.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because people are simply not paying attention</p>
<p>to their voice modulation.</p>
<p>As other people start speaking more loudly,</p>
<p>other people are speaking more loudly.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve all had this experience, right,</p>
<p>of going to a party and then you step outside for a moment</p>
<p>and you go, oh my goodness, I was shouting.</p>
<p>You come home the next day, you got a sore throat.</p>
<p>It might be that you picked up some sort of bug,</p>
<p>some virus or something.</p>
<p>But oftentimes it&rsquo;s just the fact</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve been shouting all night just to be heard</p>
<p>because as the prefrontal cortex shuts down,</p>
<p>people stop modulating their level of speech quite as much.</p>
<p>Also notice that people start gesticulating more.</p>
<p>People will start standing up and sitting down more.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll start walking around more.</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s music on,</p>
<p>people might spontaneously start dancing.</p>
<p>All of this is because these areas</p>
<p>of the prefrontal cortex normally are providing</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s called top-down inhibition.</p>
<p>They are releasing a neurotransmitter called GABA</p>
<p>onto various parts of the brain.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re involved in impulsive motor behavior</p>
<p>and thought patterns.</p>
<p>And as you shut down the prefrontal cortex,</p>
<p>that GABAergic suppression of impulses</p>
<p>starts to be released.</p>
<p>So people will say things that they want to say</p>
<p>without so much forethought about what they&rsquo;re saying.</p>
<p>Or they might do things that they want to do</p>
<p>without really thinking it through quite as much.</p>
<p>Or they might not even remember thinking it through at all</p>
<p>or experience, I should say, thinking it through at all.</p>
<p>We haven&rsquo;t talked about blacking out yet</p>
<p>and the effects of alcohol on memory.</p>
<p>But as long as we&rsquo;re there,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just tell you that alcohol has a very strong effect</p>
<p>in suppressing the neural networks</p>
<p>that are involved in memory formation and storage.</p>
<p>This is why oftentimes we forget the events of a night out</p>
<p>if we&rsquo;ve been drinking.</p>
<p>One of the more important things to know</p>
<p>about the effects of alcohol in the brain</p>
<p>is this disruption in top-down inhibition,</p>
<p>but also that areas of the brain</p>
<p>that are involved in flexible behavior,</p>
<p>sort of considering different options.</p>
<p>Like I could do A or I could do B.</p>
<p>I could say this to them or I could say that.</p>
<p>I could say it in that way or I could say it in this way.</p>
<p>This might be a little more tactful.</p>
<p>Those brain areas basically shut down entirely</p>
<p>and people just tend to say what they want to say.</p>
<p>So the key thing to understand is that when people drink,</p>
<p>the prefrontal cortex and top-down inhibition is diminished.</p>
<p>That is habitual behavior</p>
<p>and impulsive behavior starts to increase.</p>
<p>Now, what&rsquo;s interesting is this is true in the short term.</p>
<p>So after people have one or two, maybe three or four drinks,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also true that the more often</p>
<p>that people drink, there are changes in the very circuits</p>
<p>that underlie habitual and impulsive behavior.</p>
<p>Okay, this is really important to highlight</p>
<p>so much so that I want to drill into it</p>
<p>a little bit more deeply.</p>
<p>For the person that drinks say every Thursday night</p>
<p>or every Friday night or goes out only on Saturdays,</p>
<p>but every Saturday, there&rsquo;s evidence that there are changes</p>
<p>in the neural circuits of the brain</p>
<p>that control habitual behavior and impulsive behavior.</p>
<p>And they are modified and strengthened</p>
<p>in ways that make those people more habitual</p>
<p>and more impulsive outside the times</p>
<p>in which they are drinking.</p>
<p>And when they drink, impulsive and habitual behavior</p>
<p>tends to increase even further.</p>
<p>This is something that&rsquo;s not often talked about</p>
<p>when discussing the effects of alcohol.</p>
<p>And we all know the effects of being drunk can be bad,</p>
<p>right, can be bad in terms of judgment, motor coordination,</p>
<p>certainly driving drunk is a terrible thing,</p>
<p>get you or other people killed and so on.</p>
<p>But rarely do we hear about the changes in neural circuits</p>
<p>from just one or two nights of regular drinking.</p>
<p>Again, chronic drinking doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean</p>
<p>every day and every night.</p>
<p>It could be the person that simply drinks every Thursday</p>
<p>or every Friday or just once a week has three or four drinks</p>
<p>or maybe even a few more.</p>
<p>That person is going to experience a decrease</p>
<p>in this top-down inhibition.</p>
<p>So an increase in impulsivity and habitual behavior</p>
<p>because the break on those behaviors has been removed</p>
<p>while they&rsquo;re drinking,</p>
<p>but also changes in the very neural circuits</p>
<p>that allow habitual and impulsive behavior</p>
<p>to occur more readily even when they&rsquo;re not drinking.</p>
<p>And if you want to know the actual substrate for that,</p>
<p>the cellular substrate, I can briefly describe it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really interesting.</p>
<p>Again, you don&rsquo;t need to know any biology</p>
<p>to understand this.</p>
<p>What it does is it increases the number of synapses,</p>
<p>the actual points of connection in the neural circuits</p>
<p>that control habitual behavior.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s literally a growth of the neural circuits</p>
<p>in your brain that lead to existing habit execution.</p>
<p>The performance of things you already know how to do</p>
<p>and a reduction in the neural circuits,</p>
<p>or I should say a reduction in the number of synapses</p>
<p>of the contacts within the neural circuits</p>
<p>that are controlling behavior.</p>
<p>So this again is a not often discussed aspect</p>
<p>of alcohol intake.</p>
<p>Fortunately, it is reversible.</p>
<p>So in animals or humans that undertake a period</p>
<p>of abstinence of anywhere from two to six months,</p>
<p>these neural circuits return to normal,</p>
<p>except in cases where people have been chronically drinking</p>
<p>large volumes of alcohol for many, many years.</p>
<p>And in those cases,</p>
<p>while there is some recovery of brain circuitry,</p>
<p>after people get sober, meaning completely sober,</p>
<p>they stop drinking entirely,</p>
<p>there is evidence of long lasting impact</p>
<p>of heavy alcohol usage throughout the lifespan.</p>
<p>But of course, this doesn&rsquo;t mean that anyone</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s suffering from alcoholism or that used to</p>
<p>should not continue to focus on their health.</p>
<p>You absolutely should, all is not lost.</p>
<p>But for people that have been drinking for a lot of years,</p>
<p>maybe you went to college and you drank a lot</p>
<p>in those years and your neural circuits change.</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s a period in which you don&rsquo;t drink alcohol,</p>
<p>again, from two to six months, and ideally longer,</p>
<p>those neural circuits can then be remodified</p>
<p>back to their original state.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s consider some of the other neurochemical effects</p>
<p>of alcohol in the brain and body.</p>
<p>And again, for right now,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re confining the conversation to people</p>
<p>that are drinking on average one or two drinks per night.</p>
<p>Now, some people might think</p>
<p>that two drinks per night is a lot,</p>
<p>and a lot of that will depend on body weight.</p>
<p>So for instance, people who weigh 110 pounds,</p>
<p>for them to ingest two alcoholic drinks</p>
<p>is going to be substantially different</p>
<p>in terms of the biochemical effects</p>
<p>than somebody who weighs 220 pounds.</p>
<p>Of course, tolerance will also factor into this,</p>
<p>genetic background will also factor into this,</p>
<p>and indeed, whether or not people have eaten</p>
<p>will factor into this.</p>
<p>So there are a lot of factors and we&rsquo;ll talk about that.</p>
<p>For the time being, if you&rsquo;re curious</p>
<p>about how food impacts the effects of alcohol</p>
<p>and your feelings of being drunk,</p>
<p>you may have heard, for instance,</p>
<p>that if somebody&rsquo;s inebriated and they want to sober up,</p>
<p>they should eat something.</p>
<p>Turns out that does not work.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how it does work, however.</p>
<p>If you eat something prior to drinking alcohol</p>
<p>or while ingesting alcohol,</p>
<p>it will slow the absorption of alcohol into the bloodstream.</p>
<p>In other words, you won&rsquo;t feel as drunk as fast.</p>
<p>For many of you, this probably comes as no surprise.</p>
<p>In particular, if that meal includes carbohydrates,</p>
<p>fats, and proteins, okay?</p>
<p>The inclusion of all three major macronutrients</p>
<p>seems to slow the absorption of alcohol into the bloodstream</p>
<p>far more than having any one of those</p>
<p>or two of those macronutrients present.</p>
<p>Now, if you are already inebriated</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;ve had a glass of wine or a beer</p>
<p>and you eat something,</p>
<p>chances are that alcohol has already made it</p>
<p>into your bloodstream</p>
<p>because it moves into the bloodstream so quickly.</p>
<p>Again, it&rsquo;s fat-soluble and water-soluble.</p>
<p>So within minutes, if you have an empty stomach,</p>
<p>within five to 10 minutes,</p>
<p>that alcohol is going to be within your bloodstream</p>
<p>and distributed throughout your body,</p>
<p>maybe even faster depending on the type of alcohol</p>
<p>and your metabolism.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re already drunk and you eat something,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not going to sober you up more quickly,</p>
<p>but it certainly will blunt the effects</p>
<p>of any additional alcohol that you might consume.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re somebody who is concerned</p>
<p>about getting too drunk too quick,</p>
<p>even from a small amount of alcohol,</p>
<p>having some food in your gut can certainly be beneficial.</p>
<p>Now, that&rsquo;s food and alcohol and the absorption of alcohol,</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s go back to talking about the biochemical</p>
<p>and neurochemical effects of alcohol on the brain.</p>
<p>We talked about top-down inhibition</p>
<p>and we talked about habitual</p>
<p>and impulsive behavior circuitry.</p>
<p>There are also dramatic changes in the activity of neurons</p>
<p>that control the release of so-called serotonin.</p>
<p>Serotonin is a neuromodulator.</p>
<p>It changes the activity of neural circuits</p>
<p>and many neural circuits, in particular,</p>
<p>those involved in mood and feelings of wellbeing.</p>
<p>Recently, there&rsquo;s been a lot of interest in serotonin</p>
<p>because of a study that was released</p>
<p>that showed pretty conclusively that serotonin levels</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t really explain depression</p>
<p>and depression-like symptoms.</p>
<p>I want to make it very clear that although that study</p>
<p>did show that serotonin levels</p>
<p>are not necessarily associated with depression,</p>
<p>the study was interpreted by many to mean</p>
<p>that SSRI, Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors,</p>
<p>which have the net effect of increasing serotonin,</p>
<p>these are things like Prozac, et cetera,</p>
<p>that those drugs are somehow not helpful</p>
<p>because they increase serotonin</p>
<p>and serotonin isn&rsquo;t involved in depression.</p>
<p>That logic doesn&rsquo;t really hold together,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m going to use this as an opportunity</p>
<p>to just clarify what really occurred there</p>
<p>and then we&rsquo;ll talk about how serotonin</p>
<p>relates to alcohol consumption</p>
<p>in things like feeling good and in depression.</p>
<p>The key thing is this, SSRIs can help alleviate depression.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right, SSRIs can help alleviate depression.</p>
<p>They are often not always associated with side effects,</p>
<p>dosage is very important, et cetera,</p>
<p>but they probably support relief from depression</p>
<p>by changing neural circuits,</p>
<p>not necessarily by increasing serotonin itself.</p>
<p>That is, increasing serotonin with these drugs</p>
<p>likely change the neural circuits involved in mood,</p>
<p>allowing people to feel better</p>
<p>through so-called neuroplasticity,</p>
<p>which is the brain&rsquo;s ability to change itself</p>
<p>in response to experience.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a bit of confusion,</p>
<p>and again, I&rsquo;m using this episode on alcohol</p>
<p>to highlight some of the confusion</p>
<p>because I think it&rsquo;s timely</p>
<p>because the study just came out</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a lot of chatter about this out there,</p>
<p>that when people are depressed,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not necessarily because serotonin levels are low.</p>
<p>However, if serotonin levels are increased</p>
<p>with things like Prozac, Zoloft, and other SSRIs,</p>
<p>oftentimes there is, yes, a relief from depression,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s probably not</p>
<p>because of restoring serotonin levels per se,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s probably because serotonin facilitates</p>
<p>the changes in neural circuits that need to occur</p>
<p>in order for people to feel elevated mood, okay?</p>
<p>So again, that&rsquo;s a bit of a tangent and aside,</p>
<p>but I do think it&rsquo;s a vital one for people to know about.</p>
<p>Again, if you&rsquo;re thinking about taking SSRIs,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re currently taking them and you&rsquo;ve heard this news,</p>
<p>definitely talk to your doctor.</p>
<p>Again, there is great utility for some of these SSRIs</p>
<p>and also in conditions like OCD,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve been shown to be very beneficial,</p>
<p>so we really don&rsquo;t want to throw SSRIs out</p>
<p>as a potentially valuable treatment.</p>
<p>Getting back to the effects of alcohol on serotonin,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very clear beyond any doubt</p>
<p>that many of the circuits in the brain</p>
<p>that are involved in mood and feelings of wellbeing</p>
<p>and also sort of self-image and how we see ourselves</p>
<p>employ the neuromodulator serotonin</p>
<p>and alcohol when we ingest it</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s converted into acetyl aldehyde,</p>
<p>it goes and that acetyl aldehyde acts as a toxin</p>
<p>at the very synapses,</p>
<p>the connections between the serotonergic neurons</p>
<p>and lots of other neurons.</p>
<p>In other words, when we ingest alcohol,</p>
<p>the toxic effects of alcohol disrupt those mood circuitries</p>
<p>at first making them hyperactive, that&rsquo;s right,</p>
<p>making them hyperactive,</p>
<p>this is why people become really talkative,</p>
<p>people start to feel really good after a few sips of alcohol,</p>
<p>at least most people do.</p>
<p>And then as they can ingest more alcohol</p>
<p>or as that alcohol wears off, serotonin levels</p>
<p>and the activity of those circuits really starts to drop</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s why people feel less good</p>
<p>and typically what they do,</p>
<p>they go and get another drink</p>
<p>and they attempt to kind of restore that feeling</p>
<p>of wellbeing and mood.</p>
<p>Now, typically what happens is that as people ingest</p>
<p>the third and fourth, maybe even the fifth drink,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an absolute zero chance of them recovering</p>
<p>that energized mood, right?</p>
<p>Most people as they drink more and more</p>
<p>will now start to feel more and more suppressed.</p>
<p>The forebrain is now shutting down quite a lot,</p>
<p>a lot of the motor cortical areas</p>
<p>that control coordinated movement</p>
<p>and deliberate movement start to shut down.</p>
<p>So people start to slur their speech,</p>
<p>people start to shuffle their feet,</p>
<p>people forget their posture,</p>
<p>people start to lean on things,</p>
<p>people start passing out on couches.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a great depression,</p>
<p>not depression of the psychiatric depression sort,</p>
<p>but a depression of alertness and arousal</p>
<p>and eventually people will pass out.</p>
<p>Now, I said most people because there&rsquo;s a subset of people</p>
<p>that have gene variants or who are chronic drinkers</p>
<p>or who are chronic drinkers and have gene variants</p>
<p>that as they ingest the third and fourth and fifth drink,</p>
<p>what happens?</p>
<p>They become more alert, they start talking more,</p>
<p>they feel great, they have all sorts of ideas</p>
<p>about the fun they could have that night</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re the ones that if you&rsquo;ve ever fallen asleep</p>
<p>at a party for whatever reason,</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re getting tired and you&rsquo;re yawning</p>
<p>and looking around the room</p>
<p>and like these people are still drinking and partying</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re having what seems to be this amazing time,</p>
<p>often not always those are the future alcoholics in the room</p>
<p>or those are the people</p>
<p>that have a genetic predisposition for alcoholism</p>
<p>or those are the chronic drinkers,</p>
<p>the people who have built up enough of a tolerance</p>
<p>or who have the chemical genetic makeup</p>
<p>such that increasing amounts of alcohol</p>
<p>make them feel better and better and better.</p>
<p>And of course they too have a threshold</p>
<p>beyond which their nervous system</p>
<p>will start to get diminished and they&rsquo;ll pass out</p>
<p>and fall over, et cetera.</p>
<p>But that threshold is way, way higher</p>
<p>than it is for most people.</p>
<p>Now, this is important to understand</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s important to understand</p>
<p>because I think everyone should know and recognize</p>
<p>their own predisposition and kind of risk</p>
<p>in terms of developing alcoholism.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also important to understand</p>
<p>because it relates to the phenomenon of blackout.</p>
<p>You know, many people think that blacking out</p>
<p>is passing out, but blackout drunk is when people drink</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re talking and doing things.</p>
<p>Sometimes sadly they&rsquo;ll, or tragically,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll often drive home or walk home</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;ll hop on a bicycle and ride home</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;ll go swimming in the ocean.</p>
<p>All of course, very dangerous activities</p>
<p>to do when people are really drunk</p>
<p>or even a little bit drunk in some cases.</p>
<p>So these people will do these sorts of things</p>
<p>and they do them because they have the energy to do them</p>
<p>and they feel good while doing them,</p>
<p>but they are doing them while the activity of neurons</p>
<p>in the hippocampus, which is involved in memory formation,</p>
<p>are completely shut off.</p>
<p>And this is why the next day you tell them,</p>
<p>hey, maybe we should talk about what happened last night.</p>
<p>Like, what happened last night?</p>
<p>He said, well, do you remember going to the party?</p>
<p>Yeah, no, it was great.</p>
<p>We did this, we did this, and then what?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s very clear all of a sudden</p>
<p>that they have no recollection</p>
<p>of all the things they were doing despite being awake.</p>
<p>Now, I wish I could tell you</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s some sort of blood test or other biomarker,</p>
<p>even a fingerprint test that would allow you</p>
<p>to determine whether or not you have a propensity</p>
<p>to be one of these drinkers</p>
<p>that has a predisposition for alcoholism.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;ve ever been blackout drunk,</p>
<p>and certainly if you&rsquo;ve been blackout drunk</p>
<p>more than a few times, you should be quite concerned.</p>
<p>And as we talk more about the more chronic effects</p>
<p>and long-lasting effects of alcohol consumption</p>
<p>a little bit later in the episode,</p>
<p>I think it will become clear</p>
<p>as to why you should be concerned.</p>
<p>But in any case, there is something that can tell you</p>
<p>whether or not you might be in that category</p>
<p>versus likely not in that category.</p>
<p>And I alluded to this a couple of times already,</p>
<p>but I want to be really clear</p>
<p>that when people drink, no matter who you are,</p>
<p>initially there&rsquo;s that shutting down</p>
<p>of those prefrontal cortical circuits.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a gradual shutting down of the circuits</p>
<p>that control memory,</p>
<p>but then people divide into these two bins.</p>
<p>And these two bins are the people</p>
<p>who after more than a couple of drinks</p>
<p>start to feel sedated,</p>
<p>and the people who after more than a few drinks</p>
<p>do not start to feel sedated.</p>
<p>Now, of course, there&rsquo;s going to be differences</p>
<p>created by how quickly people are drinking,</p>
<p>whether or not they&rsquo;re combining different types of alcohol,</p>
<p>the types of alcohol, et cetera.</p>
<p>But in general, that can predict whether or not</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re somebody who has a predisposition</p>
<p>for alcoholism or not.</p>
<p>One also very interesting finding</p>
<p>is that alcohol changes the relationship</p>
<p>between what&rsquo;s called the hypothalamus</p>
<p>and the pituitary gland and the adrenals.</p>
<p>Now, the hypothalamus is a small collection of neurons</p>
<p>about the size of a large gumball</p>
<p>sits above the roof of your mouth,</p>
<p>and it houses neurons that are responsible</p>
<p>for some incredible aspects of our behavior</p>
<p>and our mindset.</p>
<p>Things like rage, things like sex drive,</p>
<p>things like temperature regulation,</p>
<p>very primitive functions,</p>
<p>including appetite, thirst, et cetera.</p>
<p>Alcohol, because it can go anywhere in the brain,</p>
<p>remember it&rsquo;s water and fat soluble,</p>
<p>has effects on the hypothalamus.</p>
<p>The hypothalamus normally provides very specific signals</p>
<p>to what&rsquo;s called the pituitary gland.</p>
<p>This is a little gland that actually sticks out of the brain</p>
<p>but it receives instructions from the hypothalamus.</p>
<p>And then the pituitary releases hormones</p>
<p>into the bloodstream that go and talk to your adrenals.</p>
<p>Your adrenal glands sit right above your kidneys</p>
<p>in your lower back.</p>
<p>And the adrenals release, as the name suggests,</p>
<p>adrenaline, also called epinephrine,</p>
<p>and also a molecule called cortisol,</p>
<p>which is involved in the kind of longer-term stress response</p>
<p>has some healthy effects too on the immune system.</p>
<p>Okay, so the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.</p>
<p>I know that&rsquo;s a mouthful,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t need to remember the names,</p>
<p>but the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis</p>
<p>maintains your physiological balance</p>
<p>of what you perceive as stressful</p>
<p>and what you don&rsquo;t perceive as stressful.</p>
<p>People who drink regularly,</p>
<p>so this again could be just one or two drinks per night,</p>
<p>or it could be somebody that drinks just on Fridays</p>
<p>or just on Saturdays, or maybe just on the weekend,</p>
<p>two to four drinks.</p>
<p>Well, those people experience changes</p>
<p>in their hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis</p>
<p>that result in more cortisol,</p>
<p>more of this so-called stress hormone being released</p>
<p>at baseline when they are not drinking.</p>
<p>This is really important.</p>
<p>People who drink a bit, and when I say a bit,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t mean one or two sips</p>
<p>or even a glass of wine every once in a while.</p>
<p>Again, people that are maybe having one drink a night</p>
<p>with dinner and maybe on the weekend, a few more.</p>
<p>Again, I offer a bunch of different patterns</p>
<p>to explain how it could also be two or three drinks</p>
<p>on Friday or six drinks only on Saturday.</p>
<p>Well, all of those groups experience increases</p>
<p>in cortisol release from their adrenal glands</p>
<p>when they are not drinking.</p>
<p>And as a consequence, they feel more stressed</p>
<p>and more anxiety when they aren&rsquo;t drinking.</p>
<p>This is a seldom-talked-about effect of alcohol</p>
<p>because so often we hear</p>
<p>about the immediate effects of alcohol, right?</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve been talking about some of those effects,</p>
<p>effects like reducing the amount of stress.</p>
<p>I mean, how many times have we heard somebody say,</p>
<p>oh, I need a drink, and then they have a drink,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re like, calm down.</p>
<p>Now they can shake off the thoughts about the day&rsquo;s work.</p>
<p>They can start to think about things</p>
<p>in a maybe more grounded or rational way,</p>
<p>or at least they believe that,</p>
<p>or they can somehow just relax themselves.</p>
<p>Well, while that very well may be true,</p>
<p>that it can relax them, when they are not drinking,</p>
<p>that level of cortisol that&rsquo;s released at baseline</p>
<p>has increased substantially.</p>
<p>Again, this relates to a defined neural circuit</p>
<p>between brain and body,</p>
<p>and it has to do with the ratio of cortisol</p>
<p>to some of the other hormones involved</p>
<p>in the stress response.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll provide a reference to the study</p>
<p>that describes how all of this works</p>
<p>for those of you that really want to delve into it.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s go back to this issue</p>
<p>of those who are prone to alcoholism</p>
<p>versus those who are not.</p>
<p>Remember, there are people who have genetic variants,</p>
<p>that meaning genes that they inherited from their parents,</p>
<p>that make it more likely that they will become alcoholics.</p>
<p>But there are also people who drink often,</p>
<p>who start to experience this increase in alertness</p>
<p>the longer they drink across the night.</p>
<p>Part of that effect, we think,</p>
<p>is because of changes</p>
<p>in this hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis.</p>
<p>So alcohol is kind of a double hit in this sense.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s causing changes in our brain circuitry</p>
<p>and neurochemistry that at the time</p>
<p>in which we&rsquo;re inebriated are detrimental,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s causing changes in neural circuitry</p>
<p>that persist long past the time</p>
<p>in which we&rsquo;re experiencing the feeling</p>
<p>of being tipsy or drunk.</p>
<p>Now, again, I don&rsquo;t want to demonize alcohol.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying, oh, you know,</p>
<p>if you have a glass of wine now and again,</p>
<p>or you drink a beer now and again,</p>
<p>or even have, you know, a mixed drink now and again,</p>
<p>or a shot, that that&rsquo;s necessarily terrible for you.</p>
<p>I certainly do not want that to be the message.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m saying is that</p>
<p>if people are ingesting alcohol chronically,</p>
<p>even if it&rsquo;s not every night,</p>
<p>there are well-recognized changes in neural circuits,</p>
<p>there are well-recognized changes</p>
<p>in neurochemistry within the brain,</p>
<p>and there are well-recognized changes</p>
<p>in the brain-to-body stress system</p>
<p>that generally point in three directions.</p>
<p>Increased stress when people are not drinking,</p>
<p>diminished mood and feelings of wellbeing</p>
<p>when people are not drinking,</p>
<p>and as you&rsquo;ll soon learn,</p>
<p>changes in the neural circuitry</p>
<p>that cause people to want to drink even more</p>
<p>in order to get just back to baseline</p>
<p>or the place that they were</p>
<p>in terms of their stress modulation</p>
<p>and in terms of their feelings of mood</p>
<p>before they ever started drinking in the first place.</p>
<p>So again, I don&rsquo;t want to demonize alcohol,</p>
<p>but I do want to emphasize</p>
<p>that there are long-term plastic changes,</p>
<p>meaning changes in neural circuitry and hormone circuitry</p>
<p>that across a period of several months</p>
<p>and certainly across a period of years</p>
<p>of the sorts of drinking patterns I described,</p>
<p>which I think for most people</p>
<p>are going to sound like pretty typical, right?</p>
<p>I mean, nothing that I described so far</p>
<p>was about drinking a case a night</p>
<p>or about binging on alcohol</p>
<p>in the way that we often hear about it in the news.</p>
<p>These are pretty common patterns of alcohol consumption.</p>
<p>I mean, all you have to do is board a transatlantic flight</p>
<p>or actually go to an airport on a Sunday afternoon</p>
<p>in a sunny area of the US,</p>
<p>and people are having three, four, five,</p>
<p>six beers, et cetera.</p>
<p>Again, personal choice is personal choice.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not telling you what to do,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s very clear that those sorts of drinking patterns</p>
<p>are changing neural circuitry</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re changing hormone circuitry,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;d love to be able to tell you</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re changing them for the better,</p>
<p>but they simply are not.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re actually changing them for the worse,</p>
<p>and worse is defined as making people</p>
<p>less resilient to stress,</p>
<p>higher levels of baseline stress,</p>
<p>and lower mood overall.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to take a quick break</p>
<p>and acknowledge one of our sponsors, Athletic Greens.</p>
<p>Athletic Greens, now called AG1,</p>
<p>is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink</p>
<p>that covers all of your foundational nutritional needs.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been taking Athletic Greens since 2012,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m delighted that they&rsquo;re sponsoring the podcast.</p>
<p>The reason I started taking Athletic Greens</p>
<p>and the reason I still take Athletic Greens</p>
<p>once or usually twice a day</p>
<p>is that it gets me the probiotics</p>
<p>that I need for gut health.</p>
<p>Our gut is very important.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s populated by gut microbiota</p>
<p>that communicate with the brain, the immune system,</p>
<p>and basically all the biological systems of our body</p>
<p>to strongly impact our immediate and long-term health.</p>
<p>And those probiotics in Athletic Greens</p>
<p>are optimal and vital for microbiotic health.</p>
<p>In addition, Athletic Greens contains a number of adaptogens,</p>
<p>vitamins, and minerals that make sure</p>
<p>that all of my foundational nutritional needs are met,</p>
<p>and it tastes great.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Athletic Greens,</p>
<p>you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll give you five free travel packs</p>
<p>that make it really easy to mix up Athletic Greens</p>
<p>while you&rsquo;re on the road, in the car, on the plane, et cetera,</p>

<p>Again, that&rsquo;s athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>to get the five free travel packs</p>
<p>and the year&rsquo;s supply of vitamin D3K2.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;ve been talking a little bit</p>
<p>about genetic predisposition,</p>
<p>but there are a couple of important points</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to make about that.</p>
<p>First of all, what sorts of genes are involved</p>
<p>in setting someone down the path of alcoholism or not?</p>
<p>Well, it should come as no surprise</p>
<p>that the genes that chronic alcohol usage modifies,</p>
<p>they tend to fall primarily in the pathways</p>
<p>related to genetic control over serotonin receptors,</p>
<p>GABA receptors, remember that top-down inhibition</p>
<p>and the involvement of GABA,</p>
<p>and no surprise, the HPA, the hypothalamic pituitary axis.</p>
<p>All of those, of course, combine with environment,</p>
<p>they combine with patterns of abuse, right?</p>
<p>We know that if you&rsquo;re in a social setting</p>
<p>where a lot of people are drinking,</p>
<p>the likelihood that you&rsquo;re going to drink is much higher.</p>
<p>Social pressures, trauma, right?</p>
<p>Some people will use alcohol to self-medicate</p>
<p>to try and turn off their thinking</p>
<p>or to deal with trauma, et cetera.</p>
<p>So they combine with the environment,</p>
<p>but the genes that are in the serotonin synthesis</p>
<p>and receptor synthesis pathway, GABA and HPA axis</p>
<p>combine with environmental pressures</p>
<p>to give rise to alcohol use disorders.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a fairly coherent picture</p>
<p>that we have here, right?</p>
<p>This is not a case where, for instance,</p>
<p>people that have a lot of the enzyme</p>
<p>for metabolizing alcohol,</p>
<p>which we&rsquo;ll talk about in a minute, alcohol dehydrogenase,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not like they are necessarily the people</p>
<p>that become alcoholics,</p>
<p>whereas certainly in certain cultures,</p>
<p>certain Asian cultures in particular,</p>
<p>there are gene differences</p>
<p>that lead them to have low levels of alcohol dehydrogenase.</p>
<p>There are actually people</p>
<p>who have so little alcohol dehydrogenase</p>
<p>that when they ingest alcohol,</p>
<p>they get very red and they just feel sick.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re somebody that has a sip of alcohol</p>
<p>and you just feel horrible, it makes you feel nauseous,</p>
<p>chances are you have gene variants</p>
<p>that create a situation</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re not making very much alcohol dehydrogenase.</p>
<p>You just simply can&rsquo;t metabolize alcohol.</p>
<p>So you just get a rapid buildup</p>
<p>of the toxic effects of alcohol, the acetyl aldehyde.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not converting it into those empty calories.</p>
<p>But in cultures where you have a lot of genetic variants</p>
<p>and genes expressed in people</p>
<p>where they have a lot of alcohol dehydrogenase,</p>
<p>sure, they can drink more</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re converting more of that alcohol</p>
<p>from its toxic form to a non-toxic form.</p>
<p>And yes, of course, you will observe more alcoholism</p>
<p>in those communities because they&rsquo;re drinking more.</p>
<p>But I do want to emphasize that the environmental factors</p>
<p>are playing a strong role there too,</p>
<p>because if you can drink more, you&rsquo;re likely to drink more.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re somebody that feels sick immediately</p>
<p>from drinking, it&rsquo;s likely that you&rsquo;re not going to engage</p>
<p>in alcohol consumption,</p>
<p>especially if these things are genetically related.</p>
<p>And of course, genes and culture and location in the world</p>
<p>tend to run together.</p>
<p>So do you have the gene for alcoholism?</p>
<p>Well, there isn&rsquo;t one single gene.</p>
<p>Chances are if you have an immediate relative</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s a chronic abuser of alcohol</p>
<p>or several relatives who are chronic abusers of alcohol,</p>
<p>well, that&rsquo;s going to predispose you to be an alcoholic.</p>
<p>But since you don&rsquo;t know which genes you express</p>
<p>unless you do genetic testing and those things</p>
<p>are available, but most people aren&rsquo;t doing that,</p>
<p>this assay, if you will, and it&rsquo;s not an assay,</p>
<p>as we say, an assay is a test that you run in the lab</p>
<p>to determine something.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not one that I recommend that you go drink</p>
<p>in order to do, but if you&rsquo;ve noticed that you</p>
<p>or somebody else is somebody who can drink a lot</p>
<p>throughout the night and have increased energy</p>
<p>and can just drink and drink and drink,</p>
<p>and especially if there&rsquo;s blackout episodes,</p>
<p>not remembering things the next day,</p>
<p>despite being alert throughout the entire night and so on,</p>
<p>well, then I would be very concerned that you might</p>
<p>actually have a genetic variant</p>
<p>predisposing you to alcoholism.</p>
<p>The other thing that predisposes people</p>
<p>to abuse of alcohol is age.</p>
<p>People who start drinking at younger ages</p>
<p>are greatly predisposed to developing alcohol dependence,</p>
<p>regardless of your family history of alcoholism.</p>
<p>Okay, so I&rsquo;m going to repeat that.</p>
<p>People who start drinking younger are at great risk</p>
<p>for developing alcoholism,</p>
<p>even if they don&rsquo;t have alcoholism in their family.</p>
<p>Now, of course, you don&rsquo;t have to be an epidemiologist</p>
<p>to understand that if you grew up in a family of drinkers</p>
<p>and alcohol is everywhere,</p>
<p>and especially if there&rsquo;s peer pressure</p>
<p>or lack of oversight,</p>
<p>then there&rsquo;s going to be a higher tendency</p>
<p>or a higher probability, I should say,</p>
<p>that you will start drinking at a younger age.</p>
<p>However, even people that grow up nowhere</p>
<p>near their relatives,</p>
<p>if they start drinking at a young age,</p>
<p>so for instance, at 13 or younger or 14 or 15,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a much higher probability</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re going to develop</p>
<p>a long-lasting dependence on alcohol.</p>
<p>People who take their first sip of alcohol later,</p>
<p>15, 16, or one would hope even later,</p>
<p>I can say one would hope,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m now of that age and generation</p>
<p>where you think about all the things that young people do</p>
<p>and you go, oh gosh, if they only would wait</p>
<p>or if they only would abstain, you know?</p>
<p>So this is what happens.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, there&rsquo;s some neural circuit for that</p>
<p>that I can&rsquo;t explain yet.</p>
<p>But people who, for instance,</p>
<p>drink only once they reach legal age of drinking,</p>
<p>which in the US, I believe in every state, is 21 years old,</p>
<p>if they take their first drink at 21,</p>
<p>the probability that they&rsquo;ll go on</p>
<p>to develop full-blown alcohol dependence</p>
<p>or alcohol use disorder, as it&rsquo;s called, AUD, is very low.</p>
<p>Now, a subset of them will</p>
<p>because they have such a strong genetic predisposition</p>
<p>or maybe life circumstances create a pattern</p>
<p>in which they become a chronic drinker.</p>
<p>But I found this very interesting.</p>
<p>Genes matter, but also the age</p>
<p>in which somebody starts drinking really matters.</p>
<p>Now, whether or not that&rsquo;s because there are changes</p>
<p>in neural circuitry as a consequence of that drinking</p>
<p>that make people want to seek out more and more alcohol</p>
<p>or whether or not there&rsquo;s some other effect,</p>
<p>maybe it&rsquo;s a change in hormones, et cetera,</p>
<p>that predisposes those young drinkers</p>
<p>to become chronic drinkers or even full-blown alcoholics,</p>
<p>certainly developing alcohol use disorder.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s definition for that, we can talk about it.</p>
<p>It involves the amount of drinking</p>
<p>over a certain period of time, et cetera.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s very clear that drinking early in life</p>
<p>creates a propensity for the development</p>
<p>of alcohol use disorder later in life.</p>
<p>And while there is a genetic component</p>
<p>to developing alcohol use disorder,</p>
<p>I find it very interesting</p>
<p>that if people who have those gene variants</p>
<p>delay their onset of drinking,</p>
<p>well, then the probability</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;ll develop full-blown alcohol use disorder</p>
<p>drops as well.</p>
<p>So again, it&rsquo;s genes and environments,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not an either or</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s no single gene for alcoholism.</p>
<p>Well, I promise you I will also talk about</p>
<p>some of the documented positive effects of alcohol,</p>
<p>although they are very few and far between, they do exist.</p>
<p>But before I do that, I would be remiss</p>
<p>if I didn&rsquo;t emphasize some more of the terrible things</p>
<p>that alcohol does and the way that it does it.</p>
<p>And for those of you that enjoy alcohol,</p>
<p>I, again, I really like to say I feel guilty</p>
<p>about telling you this</p>
<p>because I know how much some people enjoy a good drink</p>
<p>every once in a while.</p>
<p>And I say a good drink</p>
<p>because some people do like the taste of alcohol.</p>
<p>I suppose I lucked out</p>
<p>in that I don&rsquo;t really like the taste of alcohol</p>
<p>and that just puts me to sleep,</p>
<p>but I know that people do enjoy it.</p>
<p>And I do want to point out that there is zero evidence</p>
<p>that provided somebody is of drinking age,</p>
<p>certainly not in the stage of brain development,</p>
<p>that having one drink or two drinks every now and again,</p>
<p>meaning every three or four weeks or once a month,</p>
<p>that is not going to cause major health concerns</p>
<p>or major health issues for most people.</p>
<p>I suppose if you have zero</p>
<p>or very little alcohol dehydrogenase,</p>
<p>it might make you feel sick,</p>
<p>but then you&rsquo;re probably not the kind of person</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to be drinking at all.</p>
<p>So again, if you enjoy alcoholic drinks,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not trying to take them away from you by any means,</p>
<p>but you should know what drinking does</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re consuming it in this kind of</p>
<p>typical chronic pattern, as we can now refer to it,</p>
<p>which is that one or two a night</p>
<p>or a few stacked up on Friday</p>
<p>and maybe three or four on Saturday,</p>
<p>this kind of pattern of drinking, which is quite common.</p>
<p>And one of the more serious effects</p>
<p>that we should think about</p>
<p>is the impact on the so-called gut brain axis</p>
<p>or for sake of today&rsquo;s discussion,</p>
<p>the gut liver brain axis.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think the gut liver brain axis</p>
<p>has ever been discussed on this podcast, maybe any podcast.</p>
<p>Although the moment I say that,</p>
<p>the gut liver brain axis,</p>
<p>people are going to come after me with, I suppose,</p>
<p>gut, liver, brain, and brains.</p>
<p>In any event, you have a brain, you have a gut.</p>
<p>That gut runs from your throat</p>
<p>down to the end of your intestine.</p>
<p>Your gut and your brain communicate</p>
<p>by way of nerve cells, neurons, and nerve connections,</p>
<p>the vagus nerve in particular,</p>
<p>and by way of chemical signaling.</p>
<p>Your gut also communicates by way of chemical signaling</p>
<p>and believe it or not,</p>
<p>by way of neural signaling to your liver.</p>
<p>And as we talked about earlier,</p>
<p>the liver is the first site in which alcohol</p>
<p>is broken down and metabolized into its component parts.</p>
<p>The liver is also communicating with the brain</p>
<p>through chemical signaling and neural signaling.</p>
<p>So we have the gut liver brain axis.</p>
<p>And what you find is that people who ingest alcohol</p>
<p>at any amount are inducing a disruption</p>
<p>in the so-called gut microbiome,</p>
<p>the trillions of little micro bacteria</p>
<p>that take resident in your gut</p>
<p>and that live inside you all the time</p>
<p>and that help support your immune system</p>
<p>and that literally signal by way of electrical signals</p>
<p>and chemical signals to your brain</p>
<p>to increase the release of things like serotonin</p>
<p>and dopamine and regulate your mood</p>
<p>generally in positive ways.</p>
<p>Well, alcohol really disrupts those bacteria.</p>
<p>And this should come as no surprise.</p>
<p>I mean, earlier we talked about this</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s well-known if you want to sterilize something,</p>
<p>you want to kill the bacteria, you pour alcohol on it.</p>
<p>I can remember scraping myself or cutting myself.</p>
<p>I was always injuring myself when I was a kid.</p>
<p>And the moment they take out the peroxide,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re like, oh boy, here it comes.</p>
<p>But if there&rsquo;s no peroxide around</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve got a wound there and you need to clean it out,</p>
<p>yeah, they&rsquo;ll use alcohol,</p>
<p>which I do not recommend by the way.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s one of the harshest ways to clean a wound.</p>
<p>But for centuries, thousands of years,</p>
<p>really alcohol has been used in order to clean things</p>
<p>and kill bacteria.</p>
<p>So alcohol kills bacteria and it is indiscriminate</p>
<p>with respect to which bacteria it kills.</p>
<p>So when we ingest alcohol and it goes into our gut,</p>
<p>it kills a lot of the healthy gut microbiota.</p>
<p>At the same time, the metabolism of alcohol in the liver,</p>
<p>which you now understand that pathway involving NAD,</p>
<p>acetyl aldehyde and acetate,</p>
<p>that pathway is pro-inflammatory.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s increasing the release of inflammatory cytokines,</p>
<p>things like IL-6, et cetera,</p>
<p>tumor necrosis factor alpha.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to learn more about the immune system,</p>
<p>we did an episode all about the immune system.</p>
<p>You can find it at hubermanlab.com.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll teach you all the basics of what are cytokines,</p>
<p>what are mast cells, et cetera.</p>
<p>In any event, all these pro-inflammatory molecules,</p>
<p>those are being released.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve now got disruption of the gut microbiota.</p>
<p>As a consequence, the lining of the gut is disrupted</p>
<p>and you develop at least transiently leaky gut.</p>
<p>That is bacteria that exist in the gut,</p>
<p>which are bad bacteria,</p>
<p>can now pass out of the gut into the bloodstream.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve got a two hit kind of model here.</p>
<p>In biology, we talk about two hit models.</p>
<p>That is kind of a one plus one equals four.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s generally when you hear two hit,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not a good thing.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve got bad bacteria from partially broken down food</p>
<p>moving out of the gut.</p>
<p>The good bacteria in the gut have been killed.</p>
<p>You might say,</p>
<p>how does the alcohol kill the bad bacteria in the gut?</p>
<p>Well, the bad bacteria that are from partially digested food</p>
<p>oftentimes escape the gut</p>
<p>before the alcohol can disrupt them.</p>
<p>And so now you&rsquo;ve got leaks in the gut wall.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got the release of this bad bacteria.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got inflammatory cytokines</p>
<p>and other things being released from the liver.</p>
<p>And they are able to get into the brain</p>
<p>through what&rsquo;s called a neuroimmune signaling.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s really bizarre in terms of the way</p>
<p>that this manifests in the brain,</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s not the way I would have done it.</p>
<p>But then again, as I always say,</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t consulted at the design phase.</p>
<p>And anyone who says they did,</p>
<p>you should be very skeptical of them.</p>
<p>The net effect of this is actually to disrupt</p>
<p>the neural circuits that control regulation</p>
<p>of alcohol intake.</p>
<p>And the net effect of that is increased alcohol consumption.</p>
<p>So this is just terrible, right?</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;re taking in something</p>
<p>that disrupts two systems, the gut microbiota</p>
<p>and it disrupts in two ways.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s killing the gut microbiota</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s allowing the bad bacteria</p>
<p>to move from the gut into the bloodstream.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve also got pro-inflammatory cytokines</p>
<p>coming from the liver and those converge</p>
<p>or arrive in the brain and create a system</p>
<p>in which the neural circuits cause more drinking.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a bad situation.</p>
<p>And this is why people who drink regularly,</p>
<p>even if it&rsquo;s not a ton of alcohol,</p>
<p>again, of the sorts of patterns of drinking</p>
<p>that I talked about before.</p>
<p>And certainly for those that are chronic heavy drinkers,</p>
<p>what you end up with is a situation</p>
<p>in which you have inflammation in multiple places</p>
<p>in the brain and body and the desire to drink even more</p>
<p>and to further exacerbate that inflammation</p>
<p>and the gut leakiness.</p>
<p>So this is basically a terrible scenario</p>
<p>for the gut-liver-brain axis.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s especially prevalent</p>
<p>in so-called alcohol use disorder.</p>
<p>Again, people that are ingesting somewhere</p>
<p>between 12 and 24 drinks per week.</p>
<p>For those of you that are interested in learning more</p>
<p>about the gut-liver-brain axis</p>
<p>and in particular alcohol use disorder,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll provide a link in the show note captions.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a wonderful review on this that details that.</p>
<p>But on the positive side,</p>
<p>it points to the possibility that at least some,</p>
<p>again, at least some of the negative effects</p>
<p>of alcohol consumption,</p>
<p>whether or not you&rsquo;re somebody</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s currently ingesting alcohol</p>
<p>or who used to ingest alcohol</p>
<p>and is trying to so-called repair these systems</p>
<p>of the brain and body,</p>
<p>whether or not replenishing the gut microbiota</p>
<p>is going to be beneficial.</p>
<p>And we know that there are ways to do that.</p>
<p>And we know that there&rsquo;s at least some promise</p>
<p>for the ability for the system to repair itself.</p>
<p>How does one do that?</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;ve talked before about this on the podcast,</p>
<p>but studies done by colleagues of mine at Stanford,</p>
<p>Justin Sonnenberg, who&rsquo;s been on this podcast as a guest,</p>
<p>an amazing episode all about the gut microbiome</p>
<p>and his collaborator, Chris Garner,</p>
<p>also at Stanford School of Medicine,</p>
<p>have explored not alcoholism,</p>
<p>but what are ways to improve the gut microbiota</p>
<p>in particular to reduce the production</p>
<p>of inflammatory cytokines</p>
<p>and to adjust what&rsquo;s called the inflammatome.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve heard of the genome and the proteome, et cetera.</p>
<p>Well, the inflammatome is the total array,</p>
<p>or at least the near total array of genes and proteins</p>
<p>that control inflammation.</p>
<p>How can you reduce inflammation</p>
<p>and make that inflammatome healthier?</p>
<p>Well, they&rsquo;ve shown that two to four servings</p>
<p>of fermented foods per day,</p>
<p>and here I&rsquo;m not referring to fermented alcohol,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking about low sugar fermented foods,</p>
<p>so things like kimchi, sauerkraut, natto,</p>
<p>for those of you that like Japanese food, there are others.</p>
<p>I know things like kefir,</p>
<p>things like yogurts that have a lot of active bacteria,</p>
<p>again, low sugar varieties of all these things.</p>
<p>Those are terrific at reducing inflammatory markers</p>
<p>and at improving the gut microbiome.</p>
<p>One could imagine that either inoculating oneself</p>
<p>from some of the effects of alcohol,</p>
<p>although I&rsquo;d prefer that people</p>
<p>just not drink alcohol chronically, frankly,</p>
<p>or if somebody is trying to repair their gut microbiome</p>
<p>because they ingested a lot of alcohol</p>
<p>or because they had a lot of these inflammatory cytokines</p>
<p>for many years or even a short period of time,</p>
<p>regular ingestion of two to four servings</p>
<p>of these fermented foods can be quite beneficial.</p>
<p>I want to make it clear that has not been examined</p>
<p>specifically in the context of alcohol use disorder,</p>
<p>but because a huge component of the negative effects</p>
<p>of alcohol use disorder are based</p>
<p>in this gut-liver-brain axis and disruption</p>
<p>of the gut microbiome and the inflammatory cytokines,</p>
<p>it stands to reason that things that are well-established</p>
<p>to improve inflammation status,</p>
<p>in other words, reduce inflammation,</p>
<p>such as ingesting two to four servings</p>
<p>of low sugar fermented foods per day,</p>
<p>make sense in terms of trying to repair</p>
<p>or replenish the system.</p>
<p>One could also imagine taking probiotics or prebiotics.</p>
<p>Certainly that would work as well,</p>
<p>although I&rsquo;ve sort of favored the discussion</p>
<p>around fermented foods and replenishment</p>
<p>of the gut microbiome, mostly because there are more studies</p>
<p>that have examined that in humans</p>
<p>and because of the direct relationship</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s been established between doing that</p>
<p>and reducing negative markers within the inflammatory.</p>
<p>And I should mention along the lines of repair and recovery,</p>
<p>I put out a question on Twitter the other day.</p>
<p>I said, what do you want to know about alcohol?</p>
<p>I got more than a thousand questions.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll take some more of those questions</p>
<p>a little later in the episode.</p>
<p>But one of the things I noticed is that many</p>
<p>of the questions, hundreds, in fact,</p>
<p>related to the question of, well,</p>
<p>if I drank a lot previously, am I doomed?</p>
<p>Can I reverse the negative effects?</p>
<p>Or, you know, I&rsquo;m trying to drink less</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m trying to improve my health as I do that.</p>
<p>What should I do?</p>
<p>Well, certainly focusing a bit</p>
<p>on the gut microbiome ought to be useful.</p>
<p>The other thing I should mention is</p>
<p>as people wean themselves off alcohol,</p>
<p>even if they&rsquo;re not full-blown alcoholics</p>
<p>or have alcohol use disorder,</p>
<p>they should understand that that increase in cortisol</p>
<p>that we talked about earlier</p>
<p>that leads to lower stress threshold</p>
<p>and greater feelings of anxiety and stress,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to be present</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s going to take some time to dissipate.</p>
<p>So for some people, it might even just be helpful</p>
<p>to realize that as you try and wean yourself off alcohol</p>
<p>or maybe even go cold turkey,</p>
<p>that increased anxiety and feelings of stress</p>
<p>should be expected.</p>
<p>And in that case, I would point you to an episode</p>
<p>that we did on master stress.</p>
<p>You can find that again at hubermanlab.com.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s got a ton of behavioral, nutritional,</p>
<p>supplementation-based, exercise-based,</p>
<p>I suppose exercise is behavioral,</p>
<p>but a lot of tools.</p>
<p>You can navigate to those easily</p>
<p>because we have timestamps.</p>
<p>You can go right to the topic of interest.</p>
<p>Those tools are going to be very useful</p>
<p>in trying to clamp or control your stress.</p>
<p>And the point here is just that</p>
<p>some increase in stress should be expected</p>
<p>and it should be expected</p>
<p>because of that increase in cortisol</p>
<p>that occurs with even low-level consumption</p>
<p>yet chronic alcohol consumption.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;d like to talk about a fairly common phenomenon,</p>
<p>which is post-alcohol consumption malaise,</p>
<p>also referred to as hangover.</p>
<p>Hangover is a constellation of effects</p>
<p>ranging from headache to nausea</p>
<p>to what&rsquo;s sometimes called anxiety,</p>
<p>which is anxiety that follows a day of drinking.</p>
<p>Anxiety, I think we can understand physiologically</p>
<p>if we think about that process of alcohol intake</p>
<p>increasing the amount of cortisol</p>
<p>and the ratio of cortisol to some other stress hormones.</p>
<p>That well explains why some people wake up the day after</p>
<p>or even the day after a night drinking</p>
<p>and feel anxious and not well and stressed</p>
<p>for reasons they don&rsquo;t understand.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re somebody who experiences anxiety,</p>
<p>then again, I refer you to the master stress episode</p>
<p>that we put out some time ago</p>
<p>and you can find that hubermanlab.com,</p>
<p>tools to deal with anxiety, tools to deal with stress,</p>
<p>ranging again from behavioral</p>
<p>to nutritional supplement-based, et cetera.</p>
<p>That of course is not justification for going out</p>
<p>and drinking so much that you get anxiety-induced hangover.</p>
<p>But for those of you that are experiencing</p>
<p>post-alcohol consumption anxiety, as it were,</p>
<p>that could be a useful resource</p>
<p>because I certainly don&rsquo;t want anyone</p>
<p>experiencing uncomfortable amounts of anxiety</p>
<p>and there are great tools and resources for that.</p>
<p>Now, the other aspects of hangover,</p>
<p>such as the stomachache or headache</p>
<p>or feelings of malaise or fogginess,</p>
<p>those can be related to a number of different things</p>
<p>and probably are related to a number of different things.</p>
<p>First of all, the sleep that one gets after even just one,</p>
<p>yes, even just one glass of wine or a beer</p>
<p>is not the same sleep that you get</p>
<p>when you don&rsquo;t have alcohol circulating in your system.</p>
<p>And not trying to be a downer here,</p>
<p>but this was discussed in the Huberman Lab podcast episode</p>
<p>where I had Dr. Matthew Walker from UC Berkeley on,</p>
<p>and of course, Dr. Walker is a world expert in sleep,</p>
<p>runs one of the preeminent laboratories</p>
<p>studying sleep and its effects,</p>
<p>wrote the incredible book, Why We Sleep, and so on.</p>
<p>Dr. Walker told me, and it certainly is supported</p>
<p>by lots and lots of quality peer-reviewed studies</p>
<p>in animals and in humans,</p>
<p>that when alcohol is present in the brain and bloodstream,</p>
<p>that the architecture of sleep is disrupted.</p>
<p>Slow-wave sleep, deep sleep, and rapid eye movement sleep,</p>
<p>all of which are essential</p>
<p>for getting a restorative night&rsquo;s sleep are all disrupted.</p>
<p>So for those of you that are drinking a glass or two of wine</p>
<p>or having a hard liquor drink or a beer</p>
<p>in order to fall asleep,</p>
<p>the sleep you&rsquo;re getting is simply not high-quality sleep</p>
<p>or certainly not as high quality</p>
<p>as the sleep you&rsquo;d be getting</p>
<p>if you did not have alcohol in your system.</p>
<p>Of course, when we&rsquo;re talking about hangover,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re talking generally about the consumption</p>
<p>of more than just one or two drinks.</p>
<p>Of course, for some people, one or two drinks</p>
<p>is probably sufficient to induce hangover,</p>
<p>but for most people, it&rsquo;s going to be having three or four,</p>
<p>exceeding their typical limit, as it&rsquo;s called.</p>
<p>Again, not the legal limit, that&rsquo;s a whole other business.</p>
<p>But when one ingests too much alcohol for them,</p>
<p>one of the reasons they feel terrible the next day</p>
<p>is because their sleep isn&rsquo;t really good sleep.</p>
<p>In fact, it&rsquo;s not even sleep,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s often considered pseudo-sleep,</p>
<p>or at least that&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s called</p>
<p>in the sleep science field,</p>
<p>because people are in kind of a low-level,</p>
<p>hypnotic kind of trance, it&rsquo;s not real sleep,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re multiple bouts of waking up,</p>
<p>they may not even realize they&rsquo;re waking up multiple times.</p>
<p>Okay, so there&rsquo;s the sleep-induced effects.</p>
<p>Then there are the disrupted gut microbiome effects,</p>
<p>some of which we talked about earlier,</p>
<p>so now you understand the mechanism</p>
<p>of alcohol destroying good, healthy gut microbiota,</p>
<p>which then leads to leaky gut and things of that sort.</p>
<p>But one could imagine, again, could imagine,</p>
<p>and there is some evidence starting to support this,</p>
<p>that, again, ingesting low-sugar fermented foods</p>
<p>or maybe in prebiotic or probiotic</p>
<p>to support the gut microbiome</p>
<p>might assist in some of the gut-related malaise</p>
<p>associated with hangover.</p>
<p>In other words, get those gut microbiota healthy again</p>
<p>as quickly as possible, or maybe even before you drink,</p>
<p>have those gut microbiota healthy.</p>
<p>I would hope that you would do that.</p>
<p>I think everybody should be doing something</p>
<p>to support their gut microbiome,</p>
<p>whether or not it&rsquo;s the ingestion</p>
<p>of low-sugar fermented foods daily,</p>
<p>or at least on a regular basis,</p>
<p>or ingestion of probiotic or prebiotic.</p>
<p>The gut microbiome is so important</p>
<p>for so many different things.</p>
<p>In terms of hangover and headache,</p>
<p>we know that that&rsquo;s caused by vasoconstriction,</p>
<p>the constriction of blood vessels</p>
<p>that tends to occur as a rebound after a night of drinking.</p>
<p>Alcohol can act as a vasodilator.</p>
<p>It can dilate the blood vessels.</p>
<p>Part of that is associated with the increase</p>
<p>in so-called parasympathetic tone.</p>
<p>We have an autonomic nervous system.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s got a sympathetic component.</p>
<p>These are neurons that make us more alert,</p>
<p>and if they&rsquo;re very active, they make us very stressed.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also the parasympathetic aspect</p>
<p>of the autonomic nervous system.</p>
<p>This is all just fancy geek speak</p>
<p>for the parts of your brain and body,</p>
<p>the nerve cells that make you very relaxed.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re very relaxed, there tends to be vasodilation.</p>
<p>It allows for more movement of blood and other things</p>
<p>through the bloodstream,</p>
<p>and alcohol tends to induce some vasodilation,</p>
<p>at least in some of the capillary beds,</p>
<p>and then when the alcohol wears off,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a vasoconstriction, and people get brutal headaches.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why some people will take aspirin or Tylenol</p>
<p>or Advil or things like that,</p>
<p>the sort of non-steroid anti-inflammatories.</p>
<p>I should mention there&rsquo;s a lot of literature coming out</p>
<p>that some of these non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs</p>
<p>are not good for us for a number of different reasons,</p>
<p>the way they impact the liver,</p>
<p>the way they impact the immune system,</p>
<p>and no surprise, the way they impact the gut microbiome.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not one to tell you what medications</p>
<p>to take or not take,</p>
<p>but you certainly would want to do a quick web search</p>
<p>of effects of non-steroid anti-inflammatories and aspirin</p>
<p>before you start taking those</p>
<p>or stop taking those for that matter.</p>
<p>Generally, they will alleviate headache,</p>
<p>but they can often have other issues,</p>
<p>including liver issues,</p>
<p>and keep in mind the night after drinking,</p>
<p>your liver has already taken a beating</p>
<p>because of the need of the liver to convert alcohol</p>
<p>from acetaldehyde into acetate,</p>
<p>which is now a pathway that you well understand.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not certain,</p>
<p>and in fact, I believe it&rsquo;s not the greatest idea</p>
<p>to burden your liver further through the use of things</p>
<p>that are going to cause it to have to work harder</p>
<p>and metabolize things</p>
<p>if the goal is simply to alleviate a headache.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of kind of lore, old school lore,</p>
<p>about how to relieve a hangover.</p>
<p>We already talked about how eating food won&rsquo;t do that,</p>
<p>but eating food will prevent the rapid absorption</p>
<p>of even more alcohol into the bloodstream.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the lore that one should simply ingest more alcohol.</p>
<p>What terrible advice that is.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just going to delay an even worse hangover.</p>
<p>However, I&rsquo;d be remiss if I didn&rsquo;t say</p>
<p>that the reason that that myth came to be,</p>
<p>or that I should say that truth came to be,</p>
<p>because indeed ingesting more alcohol</p>
<p>will alleviate a hangover,</p>
<p>but then a worse hangover will show up.</p>
<p>The reason that came to be is because ingesting more alcohol</p>
<p>will cause those constricted vessels</p>
<p>that are giving the headache to dilate again.</p>
<p>But of course, ingesting more alcohol</p>
<p>to relieve a hangover is simply a bad idea.</p>
<p>Just don&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>I think this is called the hair of the dog approach.</p>
<p>Maybe someone can put in the show note captions on YouTube</p>
<p>why it&rsquo;s called the hair of the dog.</p>
<p>I can come up with a few ideas,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re not going to be very good ones.</p>
<p>And some of them would probably even be outright ridiculous.</p>
<p>So do not ingest more alcohol</p>
<p>simply to try and recover from a hangover.</p>
<p>I know many people have tried that one before,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s a terrible idea.</p>
<p>Now, one thing that you&rsquo;ll also hear out there</p>
<p>is that deliberate cold exposure,</p>
<p>for instance, taking a cold shower might relieve hangover.</p>
<p>I find this one particularly interesting</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;ve done episodes</p>
<p>on the benefits of deliberate cold exposure.</p>
<p>We have an entire episode about that.</p>
<p>You can find it again, hubramlab.com.</p>
<p>There are direct links to some of the tools</p>
<p>related to deliberate cold exposure.</p>
<p>And we have an entire newsletter</p>
<p>on deliberate cold exposure protocols.</p>
<p>You can find on hubramlab.com</p>
<p>with our neural network newsletter.</p>
<p>So those of you that are interested in ice baths</p>
<p>and cold showers and ways to leverage those,</p>
<p>you can find that there.</p>
<p>What you won&rsquo;t find there is a description</p>
<p>of how to use deliberate cold exposure</p>
<p>for sake of treating hangover.</p>
<p>But here I went into the literature</p>
<p>and I found something kind of interesting.</p>
<p>There is some evidence that increasing levels of epinephrine</p>
<p>in the bloodstream can actually help with alcohol clearance.</p>
<p>That was very surprising to me.</p>
<p>And I want to point out</p>
<p>this is not a large and robust literature,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s some evidence pointing to the fact</p>
<p>that when levels of epinephrine adrenaline</p>
<p>are raised in the brain and bloodstream,</p>
<p>that some of the components of alcohol metabolism</p>
<p>can be accelerated.</p>
<p>And some of the inebriating effects of alcohol</p>
<p>can be reduced.</p>
<p>So maybe this old school lore of taking a cold shower</p>
<p>actually has something to it.</p>
<p>So in thinking about the use of deliberate cold exposure</p>
<p>in order to reduce the effects of hangover</p>
<p>or to more rapidly clear alcohol</p>
<p>from the brain and bloodstream,</p>
<p>I want to be very clear</p>
<p>and I want to emphasize your safety.</p>
<p>The way to do that is to understand</p>
<p>that alcohol lowers core body temperature.</p>
<p>Okay, it can make people slightly hypothermic.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to drop core body temperature.</p>
<p>So if you were inebriated</p>
<p>and you went and got into a body of water, right?</p>
<p>A pool or a lake or something,</p>
<p>first of all, that&rsquo;s extremely dangerous to do</p>
<p>while you&rsquo;re inebriated, right?</p>
<p>People drown all the time.</p>
<p>People drown, they die as a consequence of doing that.</p>
<p>So please don&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>But also if it&rsquo;s a very cold water,</p>
<p>your core body temperature is going to drop even further.</p>
<p>Now, if you&rsquo;ve heard the episodes that I&rsquo;ve done</p>
<p>on deliberate cold exposure,</p>
<p>previously I&rsquo;ve talked about how normally</p>
<p>when people are not ingesting alcohol,</p>
<p>they get into an ice bath or a cold shower</p>
<p>and their body temperature initially dips,</p>
<p>but then it rebounds and increases.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a process that&rsquo;s going to occur</p>
<p>when people do not have alcohol in their system.</p>
<p>When you have alcohol in your system,</p>
<p>one of the reasons that you become hypothermic</p>
<p>is because there&rsquo;s a disruption</p>
<p>in those hypothalamic brain areas,</p>
<p>in particular, the brain area</p>
<p>called the medial preoptic area</p>
<p>that regulates core body temperature.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not so much that alcohol makes you cold,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s that alcohol disrupts the central command centers</p>
<p>of the brain that control temperature regulation,</p>
<p>and that leads you to be slightly hypothermic.</p>
<p>So if you then go get into a very cold lake</p>
<p>or you get into even a cold shower or an ice bath,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s the possibility of you going very, very far</p>
<p>down the ladder into very hypothermic territory,</p>
<p>and that can be very dangerous.</p>
<p>Now, in terms of dealing with hangover</p>
<p>when the alcohol has been largely cleared from your system,</p>
<p>well, that&rsquo;s where some of this old lore</p>
<p>combines with some of the modern science and says,</p>
<p>well, if you can spike adrenaline</p>
<p>and certainly getting into an ice bath</p>
<p>or getting into a cold shower</p>
<p>or any kind of cold body of water,</p>
<p>provided you can do that safely,</p>
<p>that will sharply increase your adrenaline</p>
<p>and I should say your dopamine, that&rsquo;s been shown,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ve talked about this on the podcast before,</p>
<p>you get these long extended increases,</p>
<p>several hours of increases in dopamine</p>
<p>from deliberate cold exposure.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s well-documented in humans, by the way.</p>
<p>So one could imagine using deliberate cold exposure</p>
<p>as a way to accelerate the recovery from hangover.</p>
<p>Provided that&rsquo;s done safely,</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s no reason to not explore that,</p>
<p>and if you wonder what safely is</p>
<p>and what temperatures to use,</p>
<p>please check out the episode on deliberate cold exposure.</p>
<p>Cold showers, therefore, might actually be one way</p>
<p>to at least partially relieve hangover.</p>
<p>Certainly the science from various places in the literature</p>
<p>converge to say that, but again, be careful,</p>
<p>please, please, please be careful</p>
<p>not to get into cold water when you are inebriated.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s absolutely dangerous for all the obvious reasons,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s dangerous also for the non-obvious reasons,</p>
<p>not the least of which is the dramatic decreases</p>
<p>in core body temperature</p>
<p>that can make you dangerously hypothermic.</p>
<p>Now, how would you go about using deliberate cold exposure</p>
<p>to accelerate recovery from hangover?</p>
<p>Well, there I would look to the kind of standard protocols</p>
<p>of one to three minutes or maybe even six minutes</p>
<p>if you can tolerate it, or if you&rsquo;re really cold adapted,</p>
<p>maybe you do seven or 10 minutes in a cold shower,</p>
<p>although that could be a lot.</p>
<p>Most people are going to experience a sharp increase</p>
<p>in epinephrine and adrenaline</p>
<p>and a long lasting increase in dopamine</p>
<p>from one to three minutes of deliberate cold exposure,</p>
<p>ideally done immersion up to the neck,</p>
<p>again, do this safely, please, please, please,</p>
<p>or a cold shower where you&rsquo;re getting under the shower</p>
<p>as much as possible.</p>
<p>How cold?</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s going to vary person to person.</p>
<p>I suggest making it as cold as is uncomfortable</p>
<p>such that you really want to get out,</p>
<p>but then you know you can stay in safely</p>
<p>without for instance, giving yourself a heart attack</p>
<p>because if the water is really, really cold,</p>
<p>of course you can give yourself a heart attack.</p>
<p>Most showers won&rsquo;t go that cold,</p>
<p>although probably some will.</p>
<p>Again, please use caution, spike your adrenaline,</p>
<p>spike your dopamine with deliberate cold exposure safely.</p>
<p>Other components of hangover that could be good targets</p>
<p>for trying to alleviate hangover.</p>
<p>And here, I hope you are getting the picture</p>
<p>because it is accurate to say</p>
<p>that hangover is a multifaceted phenomenon.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like one molecule in one receptor.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a bunch of things happening in the brain and body,</p>
<p>but is the dehydration associated with alcohol.</p>
<p>Alcohol is a diuretic for multiple reasons.</p>
<p>It causes people to excrete not only water,</p>
<p>but also sodium.</p>
<p>Sodium is an electrolyte,</p>
<p>critical for the function of neurons.</p>
<p>So making sure that you have enough sodium, potassium,</p>
<p>and magnesium, so-called electrolytes</p>
<p>is going to be important for proper brain function,</p>
<p>bodily organ function.</p>
<p>Even for people that have just had one or two drinks</p>
<p>the night before,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s likely that your electrolyte balance</p>
<p>and your fluid balance is going to be disrupted.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because alcohol also disrupts</p>
<p>the so-called vasopressin pathway.</p>
<p>I talked a lot about vasopressin</p>
<p>and the way that it interacts with</p>
<p>and controls different aspects of water retention</p>
<p>and water release from the body in the form of urine</p>
<p>in the episode on salt.</p>
<p>So again, I&rsquo;m referring to hubermanlab.com</p>
<p>as the site where you can find that episode on salt balance</p>
<p>and ways to restore electrolyte balance.</p>
<p>Having your electrolytes at the proper levels</p>
<p>before you drink is ideal.</p>
<p>Some people will say for every glass of alcohol</p>
<p>that you drink, you should drink one glass of water.</p>
<p>I would say better would be two glasses of water</p>
<p>given the dehydrating effects of alcohol.</p>
<p>And even better would be water with electrolytes.</p>
<p>That certainly would set you up for a better day</p>
<p>the next day.</p>
<p>And if you don&rsquo;t manage to do that,</p>
<p>because I suppose it&rsquo;s kind of geeky</p>
<p>walking around with electrolyte packets</p>
<p>out at the bar or whatnot,</p>
<p>although geeky in my book is a good thing,</p>
<p>the next day you could take some electrolytes upon waking,</p>
<p>maybe even some before you go to sleep</p>
<p>at the night of drinking.</p>
<p>So hangovers made worse by disturbed sleep,</p>
<p>made worse by disrupted gut microbiome,</p>
<p>made worse by disrupted electrolytes,</p>
<p>made worse by the depletion of epinephrine and dopamine.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why replenishing the microbiome with fermented foods,</p>
<p>low sugar fermented foods that is,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why using safe deliberate cold exposure</p>
<p>for spiking adrenaline and for increasing dopamine.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why consuming electrolytes</p>
<p>are all going to be beneficial.</p>
<p>The folks over at examine.com,</p>
<p>a website that I really like</p>
<p>because it just has so much useful information,</p>
<p>have assembled a list of things</p>
<p>that have been proposed, purported to improve,</p>
<p>or I should say to remove the effects of hangover.</p>
<p>And as they point out,</p>
<p>and I would like to point out over there,</p>
<p>there isn&rsquo;t a lot of quality science</p>
<p>to support the idea that any one compound</p>
<p>can eliminate hangover.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s probably because hangover, again,</p>
<p>arises from multiple organs and tissues and systems</p>
<p>in both the brain and body.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, they have a terrific list over there</p>
<p>of things, everything from Japanese pear fruit juice</p>
<p>has been proposed to do this,</p>
<p>to some other really esoteric things,</p>
<p>even things like yohimbine.</p>
<p>Frankly, when I look at the literature there and elsewhere,</p>
<p>one simply cannot find the magic substance,</p>
<p>the one herb, the one potion that can wipe away hangover.</p>
<p>Getting rid of hangover is going to be best solved</p>
<p>by doing a collection of a small number</p>
<p>of very powerful things,</p>
<p>of which I&rsquo;ve already listed off a few.</p>
<p>However, there are some additional things</p>
<p>that one can do for relieving hangover.</p>
<p>And one of them is to be very thoughtful</p>
<p>about what sorts of alcohol one consumes.</p>
<p>So I find this interesting.</p>
<p>There have actually been studies</p>
<p>of which types of alcohol lead to the greatest hangovers.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s actually a lot of legend and lore</p>
<p>about this as well.</p>
<p>Some people have said, for instance,</p>
<p>that drinks that have a high sugar content</p>
<p>lead to greater hangovers.</p>
<p>Turns out that&rsquo;s not the case,</p>
<p>or at least that&rsquo;s not what the science points to.</p>
<p>If you look at the expected hangover severity,</p>
<p>what you find is that at the bottom end of the scale,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a drink that I&rsquo;m not going to tell you</p>
<p>for the moment,</p>
<p>but what you find is that near it is, for instance, beer.</p>
<p>The consumption of beer,</p>
<p>provided it is not over-consumption, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not far beyond the tolerance of the individual.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s one or two beers,</p>
<p>is less likely to cause a hangover than say, whiskey.</p>
<p>And a glass of whiskey, or I should,</p>
<p>you know, not as much whiskey as beer, of course,</p>
<p>but a glass of whiskey, for instance,</p>
<p>is more likely to cause hangover than gin,</p>
<p>is it turns out.</p>
<p>Again, this is what&rsquo;s fallen out of the data.</p>
<p>And yet a glass of rum or red wine</p>
<p>is more likely to cause a hangover</p>
<p>than any of the other things I&rsquo;ve mentioned so far.</p>
<p>At the top, top, top of the list</p>
<p>of drinks that induce hangover is brandy.</p>
<p>And one could then say,</p>
<p>well, doesn&rsquo;t brandy have a lot of sugar?</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s the sugar that&rsquo;s causing hangovers.</p>
<p>And this is something that&rsquo;s been, again,</p>
<p>discussed over and over that people say,</p>
<p>oh, it&rsquo;s the high sugar drinks that cause hangover.</p>
<p>It turns out, however,</p>
<p>that when one looks at alcoholic drinks</p>
<p>and sugar content and hangover,</p>
<p>at the very bottom of the list</p>
<p>is, gosh, this makes me cringe just to think about,</p>
<p>is ethanol diluted in orange juice?</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t believe people actually drink this,</p>
<p>but ethanol diluted in orange juice.</p>
<p>So this is not vodka and orange juice, okay?</p>
<p>Vodka was third on the list from the bottom</p>
<p>of drinks that induce hangover.</p>
<p>Again, this is within amounts</p>
<p>that are comfortable for the person to drink,</p>
<p>that they have enough experience with,</p>
<p>or that they have the body weight to tolerate</p>
<p>without getting very, very drunk.</p>
<p>So the point is that if it were sugar</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s causing hangover,</p>
<p>well, then the ethanol diluted in orange juice</p>
<p>would probably be at the top of the list</p>
<p>in terms of inducing hangover,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not, it&rsquo;s at the bottom of the list.</p>
<p>And brandy is at the top of the list.</p>
<p>So what you find is that what scales</p>
<p>from ethanol diluted in orange juice</p>
<p>to beer, to vodka, to gin,</p>
<p>here I&rsquo;m ascending the hierarchy</p>
<p>of things that cause hangover,</p>
<p>gin, white wine, whiskey, rum, red wine,</p>
<p>and then brandy at the peak,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s sort of the world heavyweight champion</p>
<p>of hangover inducing drinks.</p>
<p>Well, what&rsquo;s increasing are congeners within those drinks.</p>
<p>Congeners are things like nitrites</p>
<p>and other substances that give alcohol</p>
<p>its distinctive flavor,</p>
<p>and that also lead to some</p>
<p>of the inebriating effects of alcohol.</p>
<p>Now, then you ask, okay, well,</p>
<p>what is it that these congeners are doing?</p>
<p>And what are these nitrites doing?</p>
<p>And guess what?</p>
<p>While they do have effects on the brain</p>
<p>and on other tissues,</p>
<p>their main effects are to disrupt the gut microbiome.</p>
<p>So what this points to, again,</p>
<p>is that having a healthy gut microbiome</p>
<p>and perhaps ensuring that you bolster your gut microbiome</p>
<p>the day after drinking is going to be especially important</p>
<p>for warding off hangover,</p>
<p>or at least reducing the effects of hangover</p>
<p>or the symptoms of hangover or both.</p>
<p>I would love to see a study on this.</p>
<p>I could imagine designing the study myself,</p>
<p>although this isn&rsquo;t really the sorts of things</p>
<p>my laboratory does,</p>
<p>but you can imagine some people getting probiotic</p>
<p>and prebiotic, some regularly,</p>
<p>some just after drinking or low sugar fermented foods,</p>
<p>and see what the effects are</p>
<p>in terms of subjective effects of hangover,</p>
<p>but also some physiological measures.</p>
<p>I think the way to think about hangover overall</p>
<p>is that, again, it represents a multifaceted,</p>
<p>multi-organ, multi-tissue phenomenon,</p>
<p>and the best way to deal with it</p>
<p>is as a multi-cell, multi-tissue, multi-chemical phenomenon.</p>
<p>And before I listed off some of the things</p>
<p>that one could do in order to adjust hangover,</p>
<p>again, the one that comes out at the top of that list,</p>
<p>I believe, at least based on my read of the data,</p>
<p>is to support the gut microbiome</p>
<p>and certainly not to ingest more alcohol.</p>
<p>And I suppose if we were to get really honest</p>
<p>with one another and ask,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the best way to avoid a hangover?</p>
<p>It would be to not drink in the first place.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve covered the major effects of alcohol</p>
<p>that lead to this state that we call drunkenness</p>
<p>or inebriation.</p>
<p>Again, there&rsquo;s a range there.</p>
<p>You can be tipsy, people can be blackout drunk,</p>
<p>people can be passed out drunk.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve also talked about hangover</p>
<p>and the fact that it&rsquo;s a multifaceted phenomenon</p>
<p>and recovery from hangover</p>
<p>involves a multifaceted approach.</p>
<p>Next, I want to talk about tolerance.</p>
<p>Tolerance to alcohol is a very interesting phenomenon.</p>
<p>It has roots mainly in the brain and in brain systems.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not time in the world,</p>
<p>let alone within this podcast,</p>
<p>to get into all the aspects of tolerance.</p>
<p>There are more than 10 different types of tolerance.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s functional tolerance, chronic tolerance,</p>
<p>rapid tolerance, there&rsquo;s metabolic tolerance,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s psychological tolerance.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s keep it simple for sake of today&rsquo;s discussion.</p>
<p>And for those of you that are interested in learning</p>
<p>about all the different types of tolerance</p>
<p>and aspects of tolerance,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an excellent review.</p>
<p>We will provide a link to this.</p>
<p>This was published in 2021, so it&rsquo;s pretty recent,</p>
<p>in the journal Pharmacology, Biochemistry, and Behavior.</p>
<p>Incidentally, or not so incidentally,</p>
<p>that was the first journal I ever published in.</p>
<p>So I have a particular affection for that journal.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, it is called</p>
<p>Tolerance to Alcohol,</p>
<p>A Critical Yet Understudied Factor in Alcohol Addiction.</p>
<p>And while this paper does include alcohol addiction</p>
<p>in the title, it&rsquo;s not just about alcohol addiction.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the basic summary of what tolerance is.</p>
<p>First of all, tolerance refers to the reduced effects</p>
<p>of alcohol with repeated exposure.</p>
<p>And it is caused mainly by changes</p>
<p>in neurotransmitter systems in the brain</p>
<p>that are the direct consequence of the toxicity of alcohol,</p>
<p>that aldehyde molecule that we talked about before.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s enormous number of chemicals that change</p>
<p>with repeated exposure to acetylaldehyde,</p>
<p>everything from GABA to dopamine to serotonin,</p>
<p>second messenger systems, adenosine, and on and on.</p>
<p>Rather than go into each of those in detail,</p>
<p>I just want to talk about the contour of the reinforcing</p>
<p>and the tolerance-inducing effects of alcohol.</p>
<p>What do I mean by that?</p>
<p>Well, here we are back to our old friend,</p>
<p>meaning the molecule that comes up over and over again</p>
<p>in these podcast episodes, which is dopamine.</p>
<p>Whether or not somebody has a predisposition to alcoholism</p>
<p>or not, whether or not they&rsquo;re an experienced drinker</p>
<p>or not, when people initially start drinking,</p>
<p>there are increases in dopamine</p>
<p>or what we call dopaminergic transmission.</p>
<p>Dopamine is involved in motivation, craving.</p>
<p>It creates a sense of wellbeing.</p>
<p>It increases energy.</p>
<p>Again, typically only at the beginning of alcohol exposure.</p>
<p>That occurs in most people as a sharp spike, as a increase.</p>
<p>Again, if somebody does not have alcohol dehydrogenase</p>
<p>or has very low levels of the enzyme that convert,</p>
<p>that acetyl aldehyde into acetate</p>
<p>and the metabolized alcohol, in other words,</p>
<p>they will feel sick and lousy in a way that will override</p>
<p>any recognition of the dopamine release.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to be the people that are listening to this</p>
<p>and just thinking alcohol just makes me feel sick.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like it.</p>
<p>Okay, that&rsquo;s a specific subcategory of people,</p>
<p>but most people experience some sort of mild euphoria.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why so many people drink, right?</p>
<p>The current estimates are that in most countries</p>
<p>and certainly in the US, as many as 80% of the adult</p>
<p>legal drinking age population drinks alcohol.</p>
<p>And that number could be even higher now</p>
<p>because in the last couple of years</p>
<p>has been a trend towards increased alcohol consumption,</p>
<p>especially in the wake of the pandemic</p>
<p>and during the pandemic.</p>
<p>Topic for another time.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s an increase in dopamine</p>
<p>and an increase in serotonin.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s kind of an increase in wellbeing,</p>
<p>an increase in mood, but it&rsquo;s a very short-lived increase.</p>
<p>Very soon after and actually triggered by that increase</p>
<p>is a long and slow reduction in dopamine and serotonin</p>
<p>and related molecules and circuits.</p>
<p>So basically what you&rsquo;re getting is a blip of feel good</p>
<p>followed by a long, slow arc of feeling not so great,</p>
<p>which is why typically people will drink again and again</p>
<p>across the night.</p>
<p>The key thing to understand about tolerance</p>
<p>is that with tolerance,</p>
<p>the duration of that long, slow reduction</p>
<p>in dopamine and serotonin gets even longer.</p>
<p>In other words, the negative effects of alcohol</p>
<p>that happened after the initial feeling good</p>
<p>extend longer and in fact, get more robust.</p>
<p>However, there&rsquo;s also a reduction</p>
<p>in the reinforcing properties of alcohol.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a shrinking of the feel good blip</p>
<p>that happens when one first ingests alcohol.</p>
<p>And this has been measured in animals and humans.</p>
<p>So the first drink that somebody has</p>
<p>provided they have enough alcohol dehydrogenase</p>
<p>that it doesn&rsquo;t make them feel nauseous and sick right away,</p>
<p>they feel really good.</p>
<p>And then as it wears off, they feel kind of lousy</p>
<p>and they want to drink more.</p>
<p>So they might drink more.</p>
<p>With each subsequent drink and even drinks on different</p>
<p>nights or even different weeks,</p>
<p>the amount of dopamine that&rsquo;s released is reduced.</p>
<p>The amount of serotonin that&rsquo;s released is reduced.</p>
<p>So what you&rsquo;re getting is less and less</p>
<p>of the reinforcing properties of alcohol,</p>
<p>the feel good stuff, and more and more</p>
<p>of the punishment pain signal aspects of alcohol.</p>
<p>This is the contour of chemical release in the brain</p>
<p>that was referred to by my colleague,</p>
<p>the incredible Dr. Anna Lembke, who&rsquo;s a medical doctor.</p>
<p>She wrote the incredible book, Dopamine Nation.</p>
<p>She was a guest on this podcast, on Joe Rogan&rsquo;s podcast,</p>
<p>on Rich Roll&rsquo;s podcast and several other podcasts,</p>
<p>world expert in addiction.</p>
<p>And she talked about this pleasure pain balance</p>
<p>that extends beyond alcohol to things like sex and gambling</p>
<p>and to other behaviors that can potentially become</p>
<p>addictive, but certainly includes alcohol.</p>
<p>So tolerance, it seems, is a process in which people</p>
<p>are ingesting more and more alcohol as an attempt</p>
<p>to get that feeling of wellbeing back.</p>
<p>But what they&rsquo;re really getting is an extended period</p>
<p>of punishment, of pain, and of malaise from the alcohol.</p>
<p>Now you might say, well, how does that relate to tolerance?</p>
<p>Well, it turns out what they do behaviorally,</p>
<p>and when I say they, I mean, animals do this</p>
<p>and humans do this, is they start drinking more and more</p>
<p>in an attempt to activate those dopamine</p>
<p>and serotonin neurons and receptors.</p>
<p>And as they do that, there is an increase</p>
<p>in alcohol dehydrogenase.</p>
<p>So the enzyme that metabolizes alcohol is increased</p>
<p>because the body and liver have to contend</p>
<p>with all that alcohol.</p>
<p>So now you&rsquo;ve got, again, the two-hit model.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re getting less of the feel-good chemicals,</p>
<p>more of the negative chemical release or pattern</p>
<p>of subjective feeling, I should say,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re metabolizing alcohol more quickly</p>
<p>and more readily, but it&rsquo;s not taking you</p>
<p>to a better place in terms of how you feel.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one of the major underlying reasons</p>
<p>for what we call tolerance.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re somebody who drinks and you notice</p>
<p>that the feeling that you are seeking with alcohol</p>
<p>is now requiring an additional drink or drinks, plural,</p>
<p>chances are you are disrupting the dopamine</p>
<p>and serotonergic systems of your brain,</p>
<p>and you are doing that in a way that is increasing</p>
<p>the pain and punishment signals</p>
<p>that follow alcohol ingestion.</p>
<p>And again, that&rsquo;s not just on the night</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re drinking, but afterwards as well.</p>
<p>Is that all bad news?</p>
<p>Well, pretty much, but the good news is</p>
<p>that if you abstain from drinking for some period of time,</p>
<p>then of course these systems reset.</p>
<p>How long you need to abstain will depend</p>
<p>on how much you were drinking</p>
<p>and how long you were drinking for.</p>
<p>Certainly people who have alcohol use disorder</p>
<p>who are alcoholics, their main goal should be</p>
<p>to quit alcohol completely.</p>
<p>I know there&rsquo;s some debate about this,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t want to get into that debate</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m certainly not going to try</p>
<p>and direct anyone&rsquo;s recovery.</p>
<p>There are expert counselors and MDs</p>
<p>and people that can work with people.</p>
<p>In fact, for some very heavy drinkers</p>
<p>and people with serious alcohol use disorder</p>
<p>going cold turkey, that is stopping drinking completely</p>
<p>can actually be medically dangerous.</p>
<p>So the path to sobriety for certain people</p>
<p>looks different than the path to sobriety for other people.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m referring to here are people</p>
<p>that are ingesting again, somewhere between on average,</p>
<p>one to two drinks per night,</p>
<p>whether or not that&rsquo;s done night to night</p>
<p>or whether or not that&rsquo;s condensed to weekend use.</p>
<p>I know a number of people are going to ask,</p>
<p>perhaps are screaming, is drinking good for me in any way?</p>
<p>For instance, many people have probably heard</p>
<p>that resveratrol is good for people</p>
<p>and that red wine is enriched in resveratrol.</p>
<p>I hate to break it to you, but the reality is</p>
<p>that if indeed resveratrol is good for us,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s some debate about this,</p>
<p>some people say strongly yes, some people say no,</p>
<p>other people say maybe, the amount of red wine</p>
<p>that one would have to drink</p>
<p>in order to get enough resveratrol</p>
<p>in order for it to be health promoting</p>
<p>is so outrageously high that it would surely</p>
<p>induce other negative effects</p>
<p>that would offset the positive effects of resveratrol.</p>
<p>So I wish I could tell you different.</p>
<p>Again, I&rsquo;m not here to be the bearer of bad news,</p>
<p>but the statement I just made was confirmed</p>
<p>by Dr. David Sinclair when he was a guest on this podcast.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s confirmed by other researchers</p>
<p>who work on resveratrol and related pathways.</p>
<p>I wish I could tell you that red wine</p>
<p>is good for your health,</p>
<p>and indeed it might be through some other mechanisms.</p>
<p>So for instance, there have been studies</p>
<p>of low to moderate red wine consumption.</p>
<p>This would be anywhere from one to four glasses per week,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t mean enormous glasses,</p>
<p>I mean six ounce glasses of red wine.</p>
<p>And in those cases, some of the stress reduction</p>
<p>that can be induced by consumption of red wine</p>
<p>may be some of the other micronutrients</p>
<p>and components within red wines,</p>
<p>in particular red wines that come from particular grapes,</p>
<p>and this gets really nuanced,</p>
<p>and frankly is not well worked out</p>
<p>in the peer-reviewed literature,</p>
<p>certainly not clinical trials,</p>
<p>at least not that I&rsquo;m aware of.</p>
<p>Tell me if you&rsquo;re aware of a great clinical trial on this.</p>
<p>Well, there may be some positive effects</p>
<p>of that very low level of consumption.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not trying to take away anybody&rsquo;s red wine.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not trying to take away anybody&rsquo;s anything.</p>
<p>I would be remiss, however,</p>
<p>if I didn&rsquo;t tell you that resveratrol</p>
<p>as the argument for drinking</p>
<p>and drinking red wine in particular is just not a good one.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just not supported by the peer-reviewed research.</p>
<p>A few other things about alcohol and health.</p>
<p>The beginning of the episode,</p>
<p>I referenced a study showing that indeed,</p>
<p>not just heavy alcohol consumption</p>
<p>of 12 to 24 or more drinks per week,</p>
<p>but also light to moderate alcohol consumption</p>
<p>of any type, wine, beer, spirits, et cetera,</p>
<p>does reduce the thickness of the brain.</p>
<p>It really does reduce cortical thickness.</p>
<p>In fact, it actually scales with the amount of alcohol</p>
<p>that people drink,</p>
<p>and this has been well-documented</p>
<p>in a number of different studies.</p>
<p>I can provide a link to several of these.</p>
<p>One of the more striking ones actually shows</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s almost a dose-dependent increase</p>
<p>in shrinkage of the gray matter volume</p>
<p>and in these white matter tracks, these axons,</p>
<p>these wires, as it were, that connect different neurons</p>
<p>as a function of how much alcohol people drink,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s also what&rsquo;s been seen in this recent study</p>
<p>that I referenced at the beginning</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s in the show note captions.</p>
<p>So again, probably the best amount of alcohol to drink</p>
<p>would be zero glasses per week or ounces per week.</p>
<p>For those of you drinking low amounts of alcohol,</p>
<p>make sure you&rsquo;re doing other things to promote your health.</p>
<p>And for those of you that are drinking moderate,</p>
<p>and certainly for those of you that are heavy drinkers,</p>
<p>please do everything you can to move away from that</p>
<p>and to quit entirely.</p>
<p>But even for the moderate consumers of alcohol,</p>
<p>you are going to want to be aware</p>
<p>of some of the negative health effects</p>
<p>and do things to offset those</p>
<p>if indeed you&rsquo;re not going to stop drinking</p>
<p>or reduce your intake.</p>
<p>One of the really bad effects of alcohol,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s extremely well-documented,</p>
<p>is the fact that alcohol,</p>
<p>because of this toxicity of acetyl aldehyde</p>
<p>and related pathways, can alter DNA methylation.</p>
<p>It can alter gene expression.</p>
<p>That can mean many things in different tissues,</p>
<p>but it is associated with a significant increase</p>
<p>in cancer risk, in particular breast cancer,</p>
<p>and in particular because breast tissue</p>
<p>is present in both males and females,</p>
<p>but in women, it&rsquo;s especially vulnerable</p>
<p>to some of the DNA methylation changes.</p>
<p>Well, breast cancer in women</p>
<p>has a relationship to alcohol intake,</p>
<p>and alcohol intake has a relationship</p>
<p>to breast cancer in women.</p>
<p>In fact, there has been proposed to be</p>
<p>a anywhere from four to 13% increase</p>
<p>in risk of breast cancer</p>
<p>for every 10 grams of alcohol consumed.</p>
<p>How much is 10 grams?</p>
<p>Well, there we need to think a little bit</p>
<p>about the variation in the amount of alcohol</p>
<p>in different drinks across the world.</p>
<p>Different countries serve different sized drinks</p>
<p>and have different concentrations of alcohol</p>
<p>in those drinks.</p>
<p>So without going down too much of a rabbit hole</p>
<p>and just giving you some good rules of thumb to work with,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;ve been studies of the percentage of alcohol</p>
<p>included in different drinks</p>
<p>and the sizes of different drinks</p>
<p>that are served in different countries.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s a kind of a patchwork of those findings.</p>
<p>In Japan, one beer, one glass of wine,</p>
<p>or one shot of liquor as it&rsquo;s served there</p>
<p>tends to include anywhere from seven to eight grams</p>
<p>of alcohol.</p>
<p>In the U.S., one beer, which generally is 12 ounces,</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s in a bottle,</p>
<p>one glass of wine or a shot of liquor</p>
<p>tends to include about 10 to 12 grams of alcohol.</p>
<p>And in Russia, one drink of the various sorts</p>
<p>that I just described typically will have</p>
<p>as much as 24 grams of alcohol</p>
<p>because of the differences in the concentration of alcohols</p>
<p>and the sizes of drinks that are poured</p>
<p>in these different countries, okay?</p>
<p>Of course, there are other countries in the world.</p>
<p>Those countries are also vitally important,</p>
<p>but those are the ones that extracted from the studies</p>
<p>that I could find.</p>
<p>What does this mean?</p>
<p>Well, what we&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>is that for every 10 grams of alcohol consumed,</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s one beer in the U.S.,</p>
<p>maybe a little bit more than one beer in Japan,</p>
<p>or basically a third of a drink in Russia,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a four to 13% increase in risk of cancer.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s pretty outrageous, right?</p>
<p>And you might think, wait, how could it be</p>
<p>that this stuff is even legal?</p>
<p>Well, look, as I described before, it&rsquo;s a toxin.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also a toxin that people enjoy the effects of.</p>
<p>I mean, in the U.S., at least they tried prohibition.</p>
<p>It certainly did lead, yes, did lead to a reduction</p>
<p>in alcohol-induced health disorders,</p>
<p>in particular cirrhosis of the liver.</p>
<p>It also led to a lot of crime</p>
<p>because it became a substance</p>
<p>that a lot of people still wanted</p>
<p>and that people were willing to break the law</p>
<p>in order to provide, or I should say to sell and provide.</p>
<p>But the point is that the more alcohol people drink,</p>
<p>the greater their increase of cancer,</p>
<p>in particular breast cancer.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because of the fact that alcohol</p>
<p>has these effects on cells</p>
<p>that include changes in gene expression.</p>
<p>And cancer, that is the growth of tumors,</p>
<p>is a dysregulation in cell cycles, right?</p>
<p>A tumor is a aggregation or the proliferation.</p>
<p>Aggregation is stuff sticking together, by the way.</p>
<p>Proliferation is stuff duplicating.</p>
<p>A proliferation and aggregation of cells</p>
<p>that could be a glioma, is glial cells,</p>
<p>glioma, brain tumor, right?</p>
<p>Could be lymphoma, so within the lymph tissue, et cetera.</p>
<p>The mutations that alcohol induces to cause this</p>
<p>are wide ranging.</p>
<p>Some of those are starting to start to be understood.</p>
<p>For those of you that are interested in cell biology,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just mention that the PD-1 pathway,</p>
<p>again, this is super specialized</p>
<p>and for the aficionados only.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need to know this.</p>
<p>The PD-1 pathway seems to be upregulated.</p>
<p>And, and we knew this from the discussion earlier,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a down regulation</p>
<p>in some of the anti-inflammatory molecules</p>
<p>that help suppress this proliferation of cancers.</p>
<p>Nowadays, there&rsquo;s a lot of interest in the fact</p>
<p>that the immune system is constantly combating cancers</p>
<p>that exist in us all the time.</p>
<p>You know, little tumors start growing</p>
<p>and our immune system goes and gobbles them up.</p>
<p>Little tumors start growing,</p>
<p>the immune system senses inflammation,</p>
<p>sends out these incredible cells,</p>
<p>these killer B cells and T cells and beats them up.</p>
<p>Cancers proliferate and take hold and cause serious problems</p>
<p>when the proliferation of cells</p>
<p>exceeds the immune system&rsquo;s ability to gobble up</p>
<p>and remove those cells.</p>
<p>There are other mechanisms of regulating cancers,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s one of the primary one.</p>
<p>And alcohol hits it, again, it&rsquo;s a two-hit model.</p>
<p>It increases tumor growth</p>
<p>and it decreases the sorts of molecules</p>
<p>that suppress and combat tumor growth.</p>
<p>So again, even low to moderate amounts of alcohol</p>
<p>can be problematic for sake of cancers,</p>
<p>in particular, breast cancers.</p>
<p>Epidemiologists and health specialists</p>
<p>love to try and compare different substances</p>
<p>in terms of how bad they are.</p>
<p>Rarely do they compare substances</p>
<p>in terms of how good they are, but sometimes they do.</p>
<p>And what they&rsquo;ll sometimes tell you</p>
<p>and what you can find in the literature</p>
<p>is that ingesting 10 to 15 grams of alcohol a day,</p>
<p>so that would be like one beer in the US,</p>
<p>one glass of wine,</p>
<p>is the same as smoking 10 cigarettes a day.</p>
<p>Frankly, it&rsquo;s hard to make that direct relationship</p>
<p>really stick because it&rsquo;s a question of</p>
<p>how long people inhale,</p>
<p>do they have a predisposition to a lung cancer, et cetera.</p>
<p>But even if that number is off by</p>
<p>plus or minus two cigarettes,</p>
<p>or even if that number would,</p>
<p>the equivalent of one glass of wine</p>
<p>equals one cigarette per day,</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s general consensus now</p>
<p>that nicotine consumed by vaping or by cigarette,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s bad for us in terms of lung cancer</p>
<p>and other forms of cancer.</p>
<p>And for some reason, I don&rsquo;t know why,</p>
<p>because this knowledge about alcohol and cancer</p>
<p>and these established relationships</p>
<p>have been known since the late 1980s.</p>
<p>The first kind of landmark paper on this</p>
<p>was published in 1987.</p>
<p>I can provide a link to that paper,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s actually quite interesting to read.</p>
<p>Well, the relationship is there</p>
<p>and yet we don&rsquo;t often hear about it, right?</p>
<p>In fact, before researching this episode,</p>
<p>I had heard before that alcohol can increase cancer risk,</p>
<p>but I wasn&rsquo;t aware of just how strong that relationship is.</p>
<p>Because of the serious nature of what we&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>because I would hate to be confusing</p>
<p>or misleading to anybody,</p>
<p>I want to just emphasize that this statistic,</p>
<p>that there is a four to 13%,</p>
<p>depending on which study you look at,</p>
<p>a four to 13% increase in the risk of cancer,</p>
<p>in particular breast cancer,</p>
<p>for every 10 grams of alcohol consumed,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s 10 grams per day.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s one drink per day.</p>
<p>But I do want to emphasize that</p>
<p>if that equates to seven drinks per week</p>
<p>and all those seven drinks are being consumed</p>
<p>on Friday and Saturday,</p>
<p>it still averages to 10 grams per day.</p>
<p>And I also want to emphasize that there are things</p>
<p>that people can do to at least partially offset</p>
<p>some of the negative effects of alcohol</p>
<p>as it relates to predisposition to the formation</p>
<p>of certain kinds of tumors and cancers.</p>
<p>I also want to be clear before I say it,</p>
<p>that doing the things I&rsquo;m about to tell you</p>
<p>is not a guarantee that you&rsquo;re not going to get cancer,</p>
<p>nor is it a guarantee that alcohol</p>
<p>is not going to lead to an increased predisposition</p>
<p>for certain kinds of cancers.</p>
<p>And the two things are consumption of folate</p>
<p>and other B vitamins, especially B12.</p>
<p>You know, the consumption of folate and B12</p>
<p>has been shown to decrease cancer risk</p>
<p>in people that ingest alcohol,</p>
<p>but not completely offset it.</p>
<p>Why that is, isn&rsquo;t exactly clear.</p>
<p>It probably has something to do with the relationship</p>
<p>between folate and B12 and other B vitamins</p>
<p>in gene regulation pathways that can lead to tumor growth.</p>
<p>At some point soon, we will get an expert in cancer biology</p>
<p>and in particular in breast cancer biology on the program,</p>
<p>and we can ask them about this.</p>
<p>But I realize this is going to raise a number of questions</p>
<p>and maybe even cause some of you to go out there</p>
<p>and start taking folate and other B vitamins and B12.</p>
<p>Not incidentally, a lot of the reported hangover supplements</p>
<p>and treatments include folate and B12.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if they had the cancer literature in mind</p>
<p>when they created those supplements and products.</p>
<p>I doubt they did.</p>
<p>Alcohol really does disrupt B vitamin pathways,</p>
<p>both synthesis pathways and utilization pathways.</p>
<p>So sometimes you&rsquo;ll hear, oh, you know,</p>
<p>if you get your B vitamins,</p>
<p>it helps you recover from hangover more quickly.</p>
<p>Again, the literature doesn&rsquo;t support that,</p>
<p>but also again, there aren&rsquo;t a lot of studies,</p>
<p>but more to the point as it relates to alcohol</p>
<p>and the formation of tumors and cancers,</p>
<p>it does appear that decreased folate</p>
<p>and other B vitamins like B12 are partially responsible</p>
<p>for the effect of alcohol and increasing cancer risk.</p>
<p>And it does appear that consuming adequate amounts</p>
<p>of folate and B12 might, again, might partially,</p>
<p>really want to boldface and underline and highlight,</p>
<p>partially offset some of that increased risk.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an additional category</p>
<p>that I want to highlight, of course,</p>
<p>and this is vitally important to state,</p>
<p>even though it&rsquo;s obvious,</p>
<p>which is that people who are pregnant</p>
<p>should absolutely not consume alcohol.</p>
<p>Fetal alcohol syndrome is well-known and established.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s terrible.</p>
<p>Fetuses experience diminished brain development.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s often permanent.</p>
<p>Diminished limb development,</p>
<p>diminished organ development in the periphery,</p>
<p>meaning the heart, the lungs, the liver, et cetera.</p>
<p>Ingesting alcohol while pregnant is simply a bad idea.</p>
<p>And the reason I say this at all is, first of all,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s important to include in an episode like this,</p>
<p>but also because we can look at two things.</p>
<p>First of all, we can look at mechanism,</p>
<p>and then we can also look at some of the lore</p>
<p>that still sadly exists out there.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take care of the lore that sadly exists first.</p>
<p>If you look online,</p>
<p>you will sometimes be able to find, sadly,</p>
<p>that some people believe that certain kinds of alcohol</p>
<p>are not detrimental to fetuses.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll say, well, champagne is safe</p>
<p>for a pregnant mother to drink, but beer is not.</p>
<p>That is absolutely categorically false.</p>
<p>Alcohol is alcohol.</p>
<p>There is no evidence whatsoever</p>
<p>that consuming certain types of alcohol</p>
<p>is safer for fetuses than others.</p>
<p>Alcohol is a toxin,</p>
<p>and the reason fetal alcohol syndrome exists</p>
<p>is because the ability of that toxin</p>
<p>to disrupt cellular processes.</p>
<p>Remember tumor growth and the way that alcohol</p>
<p>can accelerate tumor growth by proliferation of cells,</p>
<p>the wrong cells, the ones you don&rsquo;t want to proliferate?</p>
<p>Well, all of embryonic development,</p>
<p>all of fetal development, it&rsquo;s not the growth of a tumor.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s obviously the growth of an embryo,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s done in a very orchestrated way.</p>
<p>I started off studying brain development.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where I got my beginnings in neurobiology,</p>
<p>and I still teach embryology to medical students</p>
<p>and graduate students.</p>
<p>The set of coordinated processes that has to take place</p>
<p>from conception to birth in order to give rise</p>
<p>to a healthy embryo is so, so dynamically controlled</p>
<p>and so exquisitely precise with checkpoints</p>
<p>and recovery mechanisms and redundancy in the genes</p>
<p>that are expressed to make sure that if anything goes wrong,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s repaired, et cetera.</p>
<p>Alcohol as a mutagen, I haven&rsquo;t used that word yet,</p>
<p>but a substance that can mutate DNA</p>
<p>through alterations in DNA methylation</p>
<p>and these checkpoints in the cell cycle.</p>
<p>Alcohol as a mutagen is one of the worst things</p>
<p>that a developing embryo can be exposed to.</p>
<p>And again, because it&rsquo;s water-soluble and fat-soluble,</p>
<p>ingestion of alcohol when people are pregnant</p>
<p>passes right to the fetus.</p>
<p>Now, I realize that a number of people out there</p>
<p>might be thinking, oh goodness,</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t realize I was pregnant</p>
<p>until a certain stage of pregnancy,</p>
<p>and before I realized I was ingesting alcohol.</p>
<p>Obviously, one can&rsquo;t undo what&rsquo;s been done,</p>
<p>but I want to also emphasize that fetal alcohol syndrome,</p>
<p>while yes, there&rsquo;s a full-blown syndrome that manifests</p>
<p>as changes in the craniofacial development</p>
<p>that are very obvious, and you can look these up.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve probably seen these before, the pictures before,</p>
<p>rather, it has to do with eye spacing, forehead size,</p>
<p>a number of other features of the craniofacial development,</p>
<p>and of course, stuff&rsquo;s going on in the brain too.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s along a continuum.</p>
<p>So it is possible that some of the changes that occur</p>
<p>are more minor, and thankfully, the young brain,</p>
<p>in particular, the early postnatal brain</p>
<p>is incredibly plastic.</p>
<p>There are things that can be done</p>
<p>in order to help recover neural circuits</p>
<p>that didn&rsquo;t develop well, et cetera.</p>
<p>But even though it&rsquo;s somewhat obvious or should be obvious,</p>
<p>I really want to make clear that there&rsquo;s zero evidence</p>
<p>whatsoever that certain forms of alcohol are safer</p>
<p>for pregnant women to ingest than others.</p>
<p>Absolutely wrong.</p>
<p>No one who&rsquo;s pregnant</p>
<p>should be ingesting alcohol whatsoever.</p>
<p>And certainly, if people feel like they can&rsquo;t avoid alcohol</p>
<p>while pregnant, they really need to work with somebody</p>
<p>to make sure that it just absolutely doesn&rsquo;t happen</p>
<p>because it is so detrimental to the developing fetus.</p>
<p>Lastly, I want to talk about the effects of alcohol</p>
<p>on hormones, and I want to distinguish</p>
<p>between low amounts of alcohol intake,</p>
<p>higher amounts of alcohol intake,</p>
<p>and again, this chronic alcohol intake</p>
<p>versus occasional use versus really chronic use,</p>
<p>meaning alcoholic or alcoholic use disorder</p>
<p>where people are drinking an immense amount</p>
<p>on an ongoing basis.</p>
<p>The literature on alcohol and hormones is quite extensive,</p>
<p>and there are, of course,</p>
<p>many, many different types of hormones.</p>
<p>The hormones that most often get mentioned</p>
<p>and talked about on this podcast</p>
<p>are the hormones testosterone and estrogen,</p>
<p>which are present in both men and women,</p>
<p>that in both men and women are important</p>
<p>for things like libido.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re also responsible for sexual development,</p>
<p>actual development of the genitalia</p>
<p>before birth and after birth.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re responsible, for instance,</p>
<p>estrogen is important for memory and cognition.</p>
<p>You never want to drop estrogen too low in men or women</p>
<p>because it can disrupt cognition and joint health, et cetera.</p>
<p>To keep this discussion relatively constrained,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s fair to say that alcohol,</p>
<p>and in particular, the toxic metabolites of alcohol,</p>
<p>increase the conversion of testosterone to estrogen.</p>
<p>Now, this occurs in a number of different tissues.</p>
<p>This is not just occurring in the testes of males.</p>
<p>This is occurring in lots of different tissues,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll refer you to an excellent review.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll provide a link in the show note captions.</p>
<p>This is a paper that was published in the year 2000,</p>
<p>but the data are still quite strong.</p>
<p>The journal is called, of all things, Alcohol.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s, yes, literally a journal called Alcohol</p>
<p>for the publication of data and reviews</p>
<p>on alcohol and its effects.</p>
<p>And the title of the paper is,</p>
<p>can alcohol promote aromatization of androgens to estrogens?</p>
<p>Aromatization is this process of the conversion</p>
<p>of testosterone and other androgens to estrogens</p>
<p>through things like aromatase enzyme.</p>
<p>And this is a beautiful review that describes every tissue</p>
<p>or near every tissue from the ovary in females</p>
<p>to the placenta, to the liver, to the testes,</p>
<p>in which alcohol can increase the aromatization</p>
<p>of testosterone to estrogen.</p>
<p>Now, in females, this may be part of the reason</p>
<p>why there&rsquo;s an increase in estrogen-related cancers.</p>
<p>Breast cancer can be either estrogen-related</p>
<p>or non-estrogen-related.</p>
<p>There are other types of estrogen-related cancers</p>
<p>outside of breast cancer,</p>
<p>but it appears that one reason why alcohol</p>
<p>increases the risk of breast cancer</p>
<p>is because of this aromatization of testosterone,</p>
<p>excuse me, to estrogen.</p>
<p>In males, accelerated or abnormal conversion</p>
<p>of testosterone to estrogen can actually lead to growth</p>
<p>of the breast tissue in males, so-called gynecomastia,</p>
<p>or other effects of high estrogen,</p>
<p>or I should say of altered testosterone-estrogen ratios,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s really what&rsquo;s important.</p>
<p>And these can include things like diminished sex drive,</p>
<p>increased fat storage, and a number of other things</p>
<p>that I think most people would find to be negative effects.</p>
<p>I once talked about the fact that drinking alcohol</p>
<p>can increase the aromatization of testosterone to estrogen.</p>
<p>I posted that online, and I didn&rsquo;t get attacked,</p>
<p>but I did get criticized for the fact</p>
<p>that it has been shown, yes, has been shown</p>
<p>that small amounts of alcohol ingestion,</p>
<p>so five grams or so of alcohol ingestion,</p>
<p>this would be half a glass of wine or half a glass of beer,</p>
<p>at least in some studies showed increases in testosterone,</p>
<p>which was kind of surprising, but I should point out,</p>
<p>other studies have shown that alcohol ingestion</p>
<p>causes decreases in testosterone over time.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s always this issue</p>
<p>of whether or not you&rsquo;re looking at a study</p>
<p>of acute exposure versus chronic exposure,</p>
<p>you know, one dose versus multiple doses and exposure.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s fair to say, based on my read of the literature,</p>
<p>this review and other reviews</p>
<p>that focus more particularly on humans,</p>
<p>that regular ingestion of alcohol</p>
<p>is going to increase estrogen levels,</p>
<p>whether or not you&rsquo;re male or female,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s largely doing that</p>
<p>through the aromatization process</p>
<p>by increasing the aromatase enzyme.</p>
<p>Yes, there&rsquo;s some dose dependence,</p>
<p>but I think if you&rsquo;re somebody</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s trying to optimize your testosterone to estrogen ratio</p>
<p>regardless of whether or not you&rsquo;re male or female,</p>
<p>well, then most certainly you&rsquo;re going to want to avoid</p>
<p>drinking too much alcohol.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve covered a lot of topics and data</p>
<p>related to the mechanisms of alcohol,</p>
<p>hangover, tolerance, cancer risk, et cetera.</p>
<p>I acknowledge that I&rsquo;ve mainly talked to you</p>
<p>about the negative effects of alcohol.</p>
<p>I want to acknowledge that many people enjoy alcohol</p>
<p>in moderation or even light drinking,</p>
<p>the occasional drink or the occasional two drinks,</p>
<p>or maybe even on average one drink per night,</p>
<p>so seven drinks per week.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m certainly not here to tell you</p>
<p>what to do and what not to do.</p>
<p>I do find it immensely interesting, however,</p>
<p>that first of all, alcohol is a known toxin</p>
<p>to the cells of the body.</p>
<p>Some of you might immediately say,</p>
<p>well, wait, what about hormesis?</p>
<p>What about this phenomenon</p>
<p>where if we regularly ingest a toxin, it makes us stronger?</p>
<p>In other words, what doesn&rsquo;t kill us makes us stronger.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s some reason to believe</p>
<p>that might be beneficial</p>
<p>in terms of some forms of cellular resilience,</p>
<p>maybe, maybe, no, sorry.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t work that way.</p>
<p>There are processes of hormesis in which, for instance,</p>
<p>exposing yourself safely to increases in adrenaline</p>
<p>through ice baths or other things that increase adrenaline</p>
<p>can raise your so-called stress threshold,</p>
<p>but here we&rsquo;re talking about cellular stress</p>
<p>and damage to cells.</p>
<p>So my read of the literature, and again, this is my read,</p>
<p>and I invite others to provide studies,</p>
<p>or I would prefer actually collections of studies</p>
<p>that point in the direction, if they exist,</p>
<p>that alcohol can be beneficial,</p>
<p>but my read of the literature,</p>
<p>or I should say my understanding</p>
<p>of what I would call the center of mass</p>
<p>of the literature on alcohol,</p>
<p>is that no consumption, zero consumption,</p>
<p>consumption of zero ounces of alcohol</p>
<p>is going to be better for your health</p>
<p>than low to moderate consumption of alcohol,</p>
<p>and that low to moderate consumption of alcohol</p>
<p>is going to be better for you, of course,</p>
<p>than moderately high to high alcohol consumption</p>
<p>on the order of 12 to 24 or more drinks per week.</p>
<p>I realize that for most people listening to this,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s probably low to moderate alcohol consumption</p>
<p>that is part of their standard repertoire,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m not here to give you justification for doing that,</p>
<p>nor am I going to tell you not to do that.</p>
<p>I would like you to consider perhaps, however,</p>
<p>the negative effects that we understand</p>
<p>and that are documented.</p>
<p>For instance, the negative effects of alcohol</p>
<p>in the gut microbiome and the things that you can do</p>
<p>to better support your gut microbiome.</p>
<p>The negative effects on the stress system,</p>
<p>that HPA axis that we talked about earlier,</p>
<p>and the fact that even low to moderate levels</p>
<p>of alcohol consumption can increase our levels of stress</p>
<p>when we&rsquo;re not drinking,</p>
<p>and to think about acquiring some tools</p>
<p>and getting some proficiency with tools,</p>
<p>behavioral or otherwise,</p>
<p>that can help you with stress modulation</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t involve alcohol consumption.</p>
<p>Again, the point here is to illustrate</p>
<p>where the problems lie with alcohol consumption,</p>
<p>but also what I&rsquo;ve tried to do</p>
<p>is to point you to some resources</p>
<p>that can help offset some of those negative effects.</p>
<p>Will they offset all the effects?</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t say that for sure,</p>
<p>but certainly taking measures</p>
<p>to offset some of the negative effects</p>
<p>of any alcohol consumption</p>
<p>that you might be having or doing</p>
<p>is going to be beneficial to you,</p>
<p>and those tools and protocols</p>
<p>are going to be health promoting in any case.</p>
