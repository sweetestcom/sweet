    <p>The following is a conversation with Gilbert Strang.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a professor of mathematics at MIT</p>
<p>and perhaps one of the most famous</p>
<p>and impactful teachers of math in the world.</p>
<p>His MIT OpenCourseWare lectures on linear algebra</p>
<p>have been viewed millions of times.</p>
<p>As an undergraduate student,</p>
<p>I was one of those millions of students.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something inspiring about the way he teaches.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s at once calm, simple, and yet full of passion</p>
<p>for the elegance inherent to mathematics.</p>
<p>I remember doing the exercise in his book,</p>
<p>Introduction to Linear Algebra,</p>
<p>and slowly realizing that the world of matrices,</p>
<p>of vector spaces, of determinants and eigenvalues,</p>
<p>of geometric transformations and matrix decompositions</p>
<p>reveal a set of powerful tools</p>
<p>in the toolbox of artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>From signals to images,</p>
<p>from numerical optimization to robotics,</p>
<p>computer vision, deep learning, computer graphics,</p>
<p>and everywhere outside AI,</p>
<p>including, of course, a quantum mechanical study</p>
<p>of our universe.</p>
<p>This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast.</p>

<p>or simply connect with me on Twitter</p>
<p>at Lex Friedman, spelled F R I D M A N.</p>
<p>This podcast is supported by ZipRecruiter.</p>
<p>Hiring great people is hard,</p>
<p>and to me is the most important element</p>
<p>of a successful mission driven team.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been fortunate to be a part of</p>
<p>and to lead several great engineering teams.</p>
<p>The hiring I&rsquo;ve done in the past</p>
<p>was mostly through tools that we built ourselves,</p>
<p>but reinventing the wheel was painful.</p>
<p>ZipRecruiter is a tool that&rsquo;s already available for you.</p>
<p>It seeks to make hiring simple, fast, and smart.</p>
<p>For example, Codable cofounder Gretchen Huebner</p>
<p>used ZipRecruiter to find a new game artist</p>
<p>to join her education tech company.</p>
<p>By using ZipRecruiter&rsquo;s screening questions</p>
<p>to filter candidates,</p>
<p>Gretchen found it easier to focus on the best candidates</p>
<p>and finally hiring the perfect person for the role</p>
<p>in less than two weeks from start to finish.</p>
<p>ZipRecruiter, the smartest way to hire.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s ziprecruiter.com slash lexpod.</p>
<p>This show is presented by Cash App,</p>
<p>the number one finance app in the App Store.</p>
<p>I personally use Cash App to send money to friends,</p>
<p>but you can also use it to buy, sell, and deposit Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Most Bitcoin exchanges take days</p>
<p>for a bank transfer to become investable.</p>
<p>Through Cash App, it takes seconds.</p>
<p>Cash App also has a new investing feature.</p>
<p>You can buy fractions of a stock,</p>
<p>which to me is a really interesting concept.</p>
<p>So you can buy $1 worth no matter what the stock price is.</p>
<p>Brokerage services are provided by Cash App Investing,</p>
<p>a subsidiary of Square, and member SIPC.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m excited to be working with Cash App</p>
<p>to support one of my favorite organizations</p>
<p>that many of you may know and have benefited from,</p>
<p>called First, best known for their first robotics</p>
<p>and Lego competitions.</p>
<p>They educate and inspire hundreds of thousands of students</p>
<p>in over 110 countries,</p>
<p>and have a perfect rating on Charity Navigator,</p>
<p>which means the donated money is used</p>
<p>to maximum effectiveness.</p>
<p>When you get Cash App from the App Store or Google Play,</p>
<p>and use code LexPodcast,</p>
<p>you get $10, and Cash App will also donate $10 to First,</p>
<p>which again, is an organization</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve personally seen inspire girls and boys</p>
<p>to dream of engineering a better world.</p>
<p>And now, here&rsquo;s my conversation with Gilbert Strang.</p>
<p>How does it feel to be one of the modern day rock stars</p>
<p>of mathematics?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t feel like a rock star.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s kind of crazy for an old math person.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s true that the videos in linear algebra</p>
<p>that I made way back in 2000, I think,</p>
<p>have been watched a lot.</p>
<p>And well, partly the importance of linear algebra,</p>
<p>which I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll ask me,</p>
<p>and give me a chance to say that linear algebra</p>
<p>as a subject has just surged in importance.</p>
<p>But also, it was a class that I taught a bunch of times,</p>
<p>so I kind of got it organized and enjoyed doing it.</p>
<p>The videos were just the class.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re on OpenCourseWare and on YouTube</p>
<p>and translated, and it&rsquo;s fun.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s something about that chalkboard</p>
<p>and the simplicity of the way you explain</p>
<p>the basic concepts in the beginning.</p>
<p>To be honest, when I went to undergrad.</p>
<p>You didn&rsquo;t do linear algebra, probably.</p>
<p>Of course I didn&rsquo;t do linear algebra.</p>
<p>You did.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah, of course.</p>
<p>But before going through the course at my university,</p>
<p>there was going through OpenCourseWare.</p>
<p>You were my instructor for linear algebra.</p>
<p>Right, yeah.</p>
<p>And that, I mean, we&rsquo;re using your book.</p>
<p>And I mean, the fact that there is thousands,</p>
<p>hundreds of thousands, millions of people</p>
<p>that watch that video, I think that&rsquo;s really powerful.</p>
<p>So how do you think the idea of putting lectures online,</p>
<p>what really MIT OpenCourseWare has innovated?</p>
<p>That was a wonderful idea.</p>
<p>I think the story that I&rsquo;ve heard is the committee</p>
<p>was appointed by the president, President Vest,</p>
<p>at that time, a wonderful guy.</p>
<p>And the idea of the committee was to figure out</p>
<p>how MIT could be like other universities,</p>
<p>market the work we were doing.</p>
<p>And then they didn&rsquo;t see a way.</p>
<p>And after a weekend, and they had an inspiration,</p>
<p>came back to President Vest and said,</p>
<p>what if we just gave it away?</p>
<p>And he decided that was okay, good idea.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>You know, that&rsquo;s a crazy idea.</p>
<p>If we think of a university as a thing</p>
<p>that creates a product, isn&rsquo;t knowledge,</p>
<p>the kind of educational knowledge,</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t the product and giving that away,</p>
<p>are you surprised that it went through?</p>
<p>The result that he did it,</p>
<p>well, knowing a little bit President Vest, it was like him,</p>
<p>I think, and it was really the right idea.</p>
<p>MIT is a kind of, it&rsquo;s known for being high level,</p>
<p>technical things, and this is the best way we can say,</p>
<p>tell, we can show what MIT really is like,</p>
<p>because in my case, those 1806 videos</p>
<p>are just teaching the class.</p>
<p>They were there in 26, 100.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re kind of fun to look at.</p>
<p>People write to me and say, oh, you&rsquo;ve got a sense of humor,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t know where that comes through.</p>
<p>Somehow I&rsquo;m friendly with the class, I like students.</p>
<p>And then your algebra, the subject,</p>
<p>we gotta give the subject most of the credit.</p>
<p>It really has come forward in importance in these years.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about linear algebra a little bit,</p>
<p>because it is such a, it&rsquo;s both a powerful</p>
<p>and a beautiful subfield of mathematics.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s your favorite specific topic in linear algebra,</p>
<p>or even math in general to give a lecture on,</p>
<p>to convey, to tell a story, to teach students?</p>
<p>Okay, well, on the teaching side,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s not deep mathematics at all,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m kind of proud of the idea of the four subspaces,</p>
<p>the four fundamental subspaces,</p>
<p>which are of course known before,</p>
<p>long before my name for them, but.</p>
<p>Can you go through them?</p>
<p>Can you go through the four subspaces?</p>
<p>Sure I can, yeah.</p>
<p>So the first one to understand is,</p>
<p>so the matrix is, maybe I should say the matrix is.</p>
<p>What is a matrix?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s a matrix?</p>
<p>Well, so we have like a rectangle of numbers.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s got n columns, got a bunch of columns,</p>
<p>and also got an m rows, let&rsquo;s say,</p>
<p>and the relation between,</p>
<p>so of course the columns and the rows,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the same numbers.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s gotta be connections there,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re not simple.</p>
<p>The columns might be longer than the rows,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re all different, the numbers are mixed up.</p>
<p>First space to think about is take the columns,</p>
<p>so those are vectors, those are points in n dimensions.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s a vector?</p>
<p>So a physicist would imagine a vector</p>
<p>or might imagine a vector as a arrow in space</p>
<p>or the point it ends at in space.</p>
<p>For me, it&rsquo;s a column of numbers.</p>
<p>You often think of, this is very interesting</p>
<p>in terms of linear algebra, in terms of a vector,</p>
<p>you think a little bit more abstract</p>
<p>than how it&rsquo;s very commonly used, perhaps.</p>
<p>You think this arbitrary multidimensional space.</p>
<p>Right away, I&rsquo;m in high dimensions.</p>
<p>Dreamland.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>In the lecture, I try to,</p>
<p>so if you think of two vectors in 10 dimensions,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll do this in class, and I&rsquo;ll readily admit</p>
<p>that I have no good image in my mind</p>
<p>of a vector of an arrow in 10 dimensional space,</p>
<p>but whatever.</p>
<p>You can add one bunch of 10 numbers</p>
<p>to another bunch of 10 numbers,</p>
<p>so you can add a vector to a vector,</p>
<p>and you can multiply a vector by three,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s, if you know how to do those,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got linear algebra.</p>
<p>10 dimensions, there&rsquo;s this beautiful thing about math,</p>
<p>if we look at string theory and all these theories,</p>
<p>which are really fundamentally derived through math,</p>
<p>but are very difficult to visualize.</p>
<p>How do you think about the things,</p>
<p>like a 10 dimensional vector,</p>
<p>that we can&rsquo;t really visualize?</p>
<p>And yet, math reveals some beauty underlying our world</p>
<p>in that weird thing we can&rsquo;t visualize.</p>
<p>How do you think about that difference?</p>
<p>Well, probably, I&rsquo;m not a very geometric person,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m probably thinking in three dimensions,</p>
<p>and the beauty of linear algebra is that</p>
<p>it goes on to 10 dimensions with no problem.</p>
<p>I mean, that if you&rsquo;re just seeing what happens</p>
<p>if you add two vectors in 3D,</p>
<p>yeah, then you can add them in 10D.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just adding the 10 components.</p>
<p>So, I can&rsquo;t say that I have a picture,</p>
<p>but yet I try to push the class</p>
<p>to think of a flat surface in 10 dimensions.</p>
<p>So a plane in 10 dimensions,</p>
<p>and so that&rsquo;s one of the spaces.</p>
<p>Take all the columns of the matrix,</p>
<p>take all their combinations,</p>
<p>so much of this column, so much of this one,</p>
<p>then if you put all those together,</p>
<p>you get some kind of a flat surface</p>
<p>that I call a vector space, space of vectors.</p>
<p>And my imagination is just seeing</p>
<p>like a piece of paper in 3D, but anyway,</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s one of the spaces, that&rsquo;s space number one,</p>
<p>the column space of the matrix.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s the row space, which is, as I said,</p>
<p>different, but came from the same numbers.</p>
<p>So we got the column space,</p>
<p>all combinations of the columns,</p>
<p>and then we&rsquo;ve got the row space,</p>
<p>all combinations of the rows.</p>
<p>So those words are easy for me to say,</p>
<p>and I can&rsquo;t really draw them on a blackboard,</p>
<p>but I try with my thick chalk.</p>
<p>Everybody likes that railroad chalk, and me too.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t use anything else now.</p>
<p>And then the other two spaces are perpendicular to those.</p>
<p>So like if you have a plane in 3D,</p>
<p>just a plane is just a flat surface in 3D,</p>
<p>then perpendicular to that plane would be a line.</p>
<p>So that would be the null space.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve got two, we&rsquo;ve got a column space, a row space,</p>
<p>and there are two perpendicular spaces.</p>
<p>So those four fit together in a beautiful picture</p>
<p>of a matrix, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sort of a fundamental, it&rsquo;s not a difficult idea.</p>
<p>It comes pretty early in 1806, and it&rsquo;s basic.</p>
<p>Planes in these multidimensional spaces,</p>
<p>how difficult of an idea is that to come to, do you think?</p>
<p>If you look back in time,</p>
<p>I think mathematically it makes sense,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s intuitive for us to imagine,</p>
<p>just as we were talking about.</p>
<p>It feels like calculus is easier to intuit.</p>
<p>Well, I have to admit, calculus came earlier,</p>
<p>earlier than linear algebra.</p>
<p>So Newton and Leibniz were the great men</p>
<p>to understand the key ideas of calculus.</p>
<p>But linear algebra to me is like, okay,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the starting point,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s all about flat things.</p>
<p>Calculus has got, all the complications of calculus</p>
<p>come from the curves, the bending, the curved surfaces.</p>
<p>Linear algebra, the surfaces are all flat.</p>
<p>Nothing bends in linear algebra.</p>
<p>So it should have come first, but it didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And calculus also comes first in high school classes,</p>
<p>in college class, it&rsquo;ll be freshman math,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll be calculus, and then I say, enough of it.</p>
<p>Like, okay, get to the good stuff.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>Do you think linear algebra should come first?</p>
<p>Well, it really, I&rsquo;m okay with it not coming first,</p>
<p>but it should, yeah, it should.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s simpler.</p>
<p>Because everything is flat.</p>
<p>Yeah, everything&rsquo;s flat.</p>
<p>Well, of course, for that reason,</p>
<p>calculus sort of sticks to one dimension,</p>
<p>or eventually you do multivariate,</p>
<p>but that basically means two dimensions.</p>
<p>Linear algebra, you take off into 10 dimensions, no problem.</p>
<p>It just feels scary and dangerous</p>
<p>to go beyond two dimensions, that&rsquo;s all.</p>
<p>If everything&rsquo;s flat, you can&rsquo;t go wrong.</p>
<p>So what concept or theorem in linear algebra or in math</p>
<p>you find most beautiful,</p>
<p>that gives you pause that leaves you in awe?</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;ll stick with linear algebra here.</p>
<p>I hope the viewer knows that really,</p>
<p>mathematics is amazing, amazing subject</p>
<p>and deep, deep connections between ideas</p>
<p>that didn&rsquo;t look connected, they turned out they were.</p>
<p>But if we stick with linear algebra&hellip;</p>
<p>So we have a matrix.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like the basic thing, a rectangle of numbers.</p>
<p>And it might be a rectangle of data.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re probably gonna ask me later about data science,</p>
<p>where often data comes in a matrix.</p>
<p>You have maybe every column corresponds to a drug</p>
<p>and every row corresponds to a patient.</p>
<p>And if the patient reacted favorably to the drug,</p>
<p>then you put up some positive number in there.</p>
<p>Anyway, rectangle of numbers, a matrix is basic.</p>
<p>So the big problem is to understand all those numbers.</p>
<p>You got a big, big set of numbers.</p>
<p>And what are the patterns, what&rsquo;s going on?</p>
<p>And so one of the ways to break down that matrix</p>
<p>into simple pieces is uses something called singular values.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s come on as fundamental in the last,</p>
<p>certainly in my lifetime.</p>
<p>Eigenvalues, if you have viewers who&rsquo;ve done engineering,</p>
<p>math, or basic linear algebra, eigenvalues were in there.</p>
<p>But those are restricted to square matrices.</p>
<p>And data comes in rectangular matrices.</p>
<p>So you gotta take that next step.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m always pushing math faculty, get on, do it, do it.</p>
<p>Singular values.</p>
<p>So those are a way to break, to find the important pieces</p>
<p>of the matrix, which add up to the whole matrix.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re breaking a matrix into simple pieces.</p>
<p>And the first piece is the most important part of the data.</p>
<p>The second piece is the second most important part.</p>
<p>And then often, so a data set is a matrix.</p>
<p>And often, so a data scientist will like,</p>
<p>if a data scientist can find those first and second pieces,</p>
<p>stop there, the rest of the data is probably round off,</p>
<p>experimental error maybe.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re looking for the important part.</p>
<p>So what do you find beautiful about singular values?</p>
<p>Well, yeah, I didn&rsquo;t give the theorem.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s the idea of singular values.</p>
<p>Every matrix, every matrix, rectangular, square, whatever,</p>
<p>can be written as a product</p>
<p>of three very simple special matrices.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the theorem.</p>
<p>Every matrix can be written as a rotation times a stretch,</p>
<p>which is just a diagonal matrix,</p>
<p>otherwise all zeros except on the one diagonal.</p>
<p>And then the third factor is another rotation.</p>
<p>So rotation, stretch, rotation</p>
<p>is the breakup of any matrix.</p>
<p>The structure of that, the ability that you can do that,</p>
<p>what do you find appealing?</p>
<p>What do you find beautiful about it?</p>
<p>Well, geometrically, as I freely admit,</p>
<p>the action of a matrix is not so easy to visualize,</p>
<p>but everybody can visualize a rotation.</p>
<p>Take two dimensional space and just turn it</p>
<p>around the center.</p>
<p>Take three dimensional space.</p>
<p>So a pilot has to know about,</p>
<p>well, what are the three, the yaw is one of them.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve forgotten all the three turns that a pilot makes.</p>
<p>Up to 10 dimensions, you&rsquo;ve got 10 ways to turn,</p>
<p>but you can visualize a rotation.</p>
<p>Take the space and turn it.</p>
<p>And you can visualize a stretch.</p>
<p>So to break a matrix with all those numbers in it</p>
<p>into something you can visualize,</p>
<p>rotate, stretch, rotate is pretty neat.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty neat.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s pretty powerful.</p>
<p>On YouTube, just consuming a bunch of videos</p>
<p>and just watching what people connect with</p>
<p>and what they really enjoy and are inspired by,</p>
<p>math seems to come up again and again.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to understand why that is.</p>
<p>Perhaps you can help give me clues.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not just the kinds of lectures that you give,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also just other folks like with Numberphile,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a channel where they just chat about things</p>
<p>that are extremely complicated, actually.</p>
<p>People nevertheless connect with them.</p>
<p>What do you think that is?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s wonderful, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>I mean, I wasn&rsquo;t really aware of it.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re conditioned to think math is hard,</p>
<p>math is abstract, math is just for a few people,</p>
<p>but it isn&rsquo;t that way.</p>
<p>A lot of people quite like math and they liked it.</p>
<p>I get messages from people saying,</p>
<p>now I&rsquo;m retired, I&rsquo;m gonna learn some more math.</p>
<p>I get a lot of those.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really encouraging.</p>
<p>And I think what people like is that there&rsquo;s some order,</p>
<p>a lot of order and things are not obvious, but they&rsquo;re true.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s really cheering to think that so many people</p>
<p>really wanna learn more about math.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And in terms of truth, again,</p>
<p>sorry to slide into philosophy at times,</p>
<p>but math does reveal pretty strongly what things are true.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s the whole point of proving things.</p>
<p>It is, yeah.</p>
<p>And yet, sort of our real world is messy and complicated.</p>
<p>It is.</p>
<p>What do you think about the nature of truth</p>
<p>that math reveals?</p>
<p>Oh, wow.</p>
<p>Because it is a source of comfort like you&rsquo;ve mentioned.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Well, I have to say, I&rsquo;m not much of a philosopher.</p>
<p>I just like numbers.</p>
<p>As a kid, this was before you had to go in,</p>
<p>when you had a filly in your teeth,</p>
<p>you had to kind of just take it.</p>
<p>So what I did was think about math,</p>
<p>like take powers of two, two, four, eight, 16,</p>
<p>up until the time the tooth stopped hurting</p>
<p>and the dentist said you&rsquo;re through.</p>
<p>Or counting.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So that was a source of just, source of peace almost.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What is it about math do you think that brings that?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What is that?</p>
<p>Well, you know where you are.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s symmetry, it&rsquo;s certainty.</p>
<p>The fact that, you know, if you multiply two by itself</p>
<p>10 times, you get 1,024 period.</p>
<p>Everybody&rsquo;s gonna get that.</p>
<p>Do you see math as a powerful tool or as an art form?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s both.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really one of the neat things.</p>
<p>You can be an artist and like math,</p>
<p>you can be an engineer and use math.</p>
<p>Which are you?</p>
<p>Which am I?</p>
<p>What did you connect with most?</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m somewhere between.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m certainly not a artist type, philosopher type person.</p>
<p>Might sound that way this morning, but I&rsquo;m not.</p>
<p>Yeah, I really enjoy teaching engineers</p>
<p>because they go for an answer.</p>
<p>And yeah, so probably within the MIT math department,</p>
<p>most people enjoy teaching people,</p>
<p>teaching students who get the abstract idea.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m okay with, I&rsquo;m good with engineers</p>
<p>who are looking for a way to find answers.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Actually, that&rsquo;s an interesting question.</p>
<p>Do you think for teaching and in general,</p>
<p>thinking about new concepts,</p>
<p>do you think it&rsquo;s better to plug in the numbers</p>
<p>or to think more abstractly?</p>
<p>So looking at theorems and proving the theorems</p>
<p>or actually building up a basic intuition of the theorem</p>
<p>or the method, the approach,</p>
<p>and then just plugging in numbers and seeing it work.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, certainly many of us like to see examples.</p>
<p>First, we understand,</p>
<p>it might be a pretty abstract sounding example,</p>
<p>like a three dimensional rotation.</p>
<p>How are you gonna understand a rotation in 3D?</p>
<p>Or in 10D?</p>
<p>And then some of us like to keep going with it</p>
<p>to the point where you got numbers,</p>
<p>where you got 10 angles, 10 axes, 10 angles.</p>
<p>But the best, the great mathematicians probably,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if they do that,</p>
<p>because for them, an example would be a highly abstract thing</p>
<p>to the rest of it.</p>
<p>Right, but nevertheless, working in the space of examples.</p>
<p>Yeah, examples.</p>
<p>It seems to.</p>
<p>Examples of structure.</p>
<p>Our brains seem to connect with that.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not sure if you&rsquo;re familiar with him,</p>
<p>but Andrew Yang is a presidential candidate</p>
<p>currently running with math in all capital letters</p>
<p>and his hats as a slogan.</p>
<p>I see.</p>
<p>Stands for Make America Think Hard.</p>
<p>Okay, I&rsquo;ll vote for him.</p>
<p>So, and his name rhymes with yours, Yang, Strang.</p>
<p>But he also loves math and he comes from that world</p>
<p>of, but he also, looking at it,</p>
<p>makes me realize that math, science, and engineering</p>
<p>are not really part of our politics, political discourse,</p>
<p>about political government in general.</p>
<p>Why do you think that is?</p>
<p>Well.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts on that in general?</p>
<p>Well, certainly somewhere in the system,</p>
<p>we need people who are comfortable with numbers,</p>
<p>comfortable with quantities.</p>
<p>You know, if you say this leads to that,</p>
<p>they see it and it&rsquo;s undeniable.</p>
<p>But isn&rsquo;t that strange to you that we have almost no,</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m pretty sure we have no elected officials</p>
<p>in Congress or obviously the president</p>
<p>that either has an engineering degree or a math degree.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, that&rsquo;s too bad.</p>
<p>A few could, a few who could make the connection.</p>
<p>Yeah, it would have to be people who understand</p>
<p>engineering or science and at the same time</p>
<p>can make speeches and lead, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, inspire people.</p>
<p>Yeah, inspire, yeah.</p>
<p>You were, speaking of inspiration,</p>
<p>the president of the Society</p>
<p>for Industrial and Applied Mathematics.</p>
<p>Oh, yes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a major organization in math, applied math.</p>
<p>What do you see as a role of that society,</p>
<p>you know, in our public discourse?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>In public.</p>
<p>Yeah, so, well, it was fun to be president at the time.</p>
<p>A couple years, a few years.</p>
<p>Two years, around 2000.</p>
<p>I just hope that&rsquo;s president of a pretty small society.</p>
<p>But nevertheless, it was a time when math</p>
<p>was getting some more attention in Washington.</p>
<p>But yeah, I got to give a little 10 minutes</p>
<p>to a committee of the House of Representatives</p>
<p>talking about who I met.</p>
<p>And then, actually, it was fun</p>
<p>because one of the members of the House</p>
<p>had been a student, had been in my class.</p>
<p>What do you think of that?</p>
<p>Yeah, as you say, pretty rare, most members of the House</p>
<p>have had a different training, different background.</p>
<p>But there was one from New Hampshire</p>
<p>who was my friend, really, by being in the class.</p>
<p>Yeah, so those years were good.</p>
<p>Then, of course, other things take over in importance</p>
<p>in Washington, and math just, at this point,</p>
<p>is not so visible.</p>
<p>But for a little moment, it was.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some excitement, some concern</p>
<p>about artificial intelligence in Washington now.</p>
<p>Yes, sure. About the future.</p>
<p>Yeah. And I think at the core</p>
<p>of that is math.</p>
<p>Well, it is, yeah.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s hidden.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s wearing a different hat.</p>
<p>Well, artificial intelligence, and particularly,</p>
<p>can I use the words deep learning?</p>
<p>Deep learning is a particular approach</p>
<p>to understanding data.</p>
<p>Again, you&rsquo;ve got a big, whole lot of data</p>
<p>where data is just swamping the computers of the world.</p>
<p>And to understand it, out of all those numbers,</p>
<p>to find what&rsquo;s important in climate, in everything.</p>
<p>And artificial intelligence is two words</p>
<p>for one approach to data.</p>
<p>Deep learning is a specific approach there,</p>
<p>which uses a lot of linear algebra.</p>
<p>So I got into it.</p>
<p>I thought, okay, I&rsquo;ve gotta learn about this.</p>
<p>So maybe from your perspective,</p>
<p>let me ask the most basic question.</p>
<p>How do you think of a neural network?</p>
<p>What is a neural network?</p>
<p>Yeah, okay.</p>
<p>So can I start with the idea about deep learning?</p>
<p>What does that mean?</p>
<p>What is deep learning?</p>
<p>What is deep learning, yeah.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re trying to learn, from all this data,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re trying to learn what&rsquo;s important.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s it telling us?</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve got data, you&rsquo;ve got some inputs</p>
<p>for which you know the right outputs.</p>
<p>The question is, can you see the pattern there?</p>
<p>Can you figure out a way for a new input,</p>
<p>which we haven&rsquo;t seen, to understand</p>
<p>what the output will be from that new input?</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve got a million inputs with their outputs.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re trying to create some pattern,</p>
<p>some rule that&rsquo;ll take those inputs,</p>
<p>those million training inputs, which we know about,</p>
<p>to the correct million outputs.</p>
<p>And this idea of a neural net</p>
<p>is part of the structure of our new way to create a rule.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re looking for a rule that will take</p>
<p>these training inputs to the known outputs.</p>
<p>And then we&rsquo;re gonna use that rule on new inputs</p>
<p>that we don&rsquo;t know the output and see what comes.</p>
<p>Linear algebra is a big part of finding that rule.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right, linear algebra is a big part.</p>
<p>Not all the part.</p>
<p>People were leaning on matrices, that&rsquo;s good, still do.</p>
<p>Linear is something special.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all about straight lines and flat planes.</p>
<p>And data isn&rsquo;t quite like that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more complicated.</p>
<p>So you gotta introduce some complication.</p>
<p>So you have to have some function</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not a straight line.</p>
<p>And it turned out, nonlinear, nonlinear, not linear.</p>
<p>And it turned out that it was enough to use the function</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s one straight line and then a different one.</p>
<p>Halfway, so piecewise linear.</p>
<p>One piece has one slope,</p>
<p>one piece, the other piece has the second slope.</p>
<p>And so that, getting that nonlinear,</p>
<p>simple nonlinearity in blew the problem open.</p>
<p>That little piece makes it sufficiently complicated</p>
<p>to make things interesting.</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;re gonna use that piece</p>
<p>over and over a million times.</p>
<p>So it has a fold in the graph, the graph, two pieces.</p>
<p>But when you fold something a million times,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got a pretty complicated function</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s pretty realistic.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the thing about neural networks</p>
<p>is they have a lot of these.</p>
<p>A lot of these, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>So why do you think neural networks,</p>
<p>by using sort of formulating an objective function,</p>
<p>very not a plain function of the folds,</p>
<p>lots of folds of the inputs, the outputs,</p>
<p>why do you think they work to be able to find a rule</p>
<p>that we don&rsquo;t know is optimal,</p>
<p>but it just seems to be pretty good in a lot of cases?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your intuition?</p>
<p>Is it surprising to you as it is to many people?</p>
<p>Do you have an intuition of why this works at all?</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m beginning to have a better intuition.</p>
<p>This idea of things that are piecewise linear,</p>
<p>flat pieces but with folds between them.</p>
<p>Like think of a roof of a complicated,</p>
<p>infinitely complicated house or something.</p>
<p>That curve, it almost curved, but every piece is flat.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s been used by engineers,</p>
<p>that idea has been used by engineers,</p>
<p>is used by engineers, big time.</p>
<p>Something called the finite element method.</p>
<p>If you want to design a bridge,</p>
<p>design a building, design an airplane,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re using this idea of piecewise flat</p>
<p>as a good, simple, computable approximation.</p>
<p>But you have a sense that there&rsquo;s a lot of expressive power</p>
<p>in this kind of piecewise linear.</p>
<p>Yeah, you used the right word.</p>
<p>If you measure the expressivity,</p>
<p>how complicated a thing can this piecewise flat guys express?</p>
<p>The answer is very complicated, yeah.</p>
<p>What do you think are the limits of such piecewise linear</p>
<p>or just of neural networks?</p>
<p>The expressivity of neural networks.</p>
<p>Well, you would have said a while ago</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re just computational limits.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a problem beyond a certain size.</p>
<p>A supercomputer isn&rsquo;t gonna do it.</p>
<p>But those keep getting more powerful.</p>
<p>So that limit has been moved</p>
<p>to allow more and more complicated surfaces.</p>
<p>So in terms of just mapping from inputs to outputs,</p>
<p>looking at data, what do you think of,</p>
<p>in the context of neural networks in general,</p>
<p>data is just tensor, vectors, matrices, tensors.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>How do you think about learning from data?</p>
<p>How much of our world can be expressed in this way?</p>
<p>How useful is this process?</p>
<p>I guess that&rsquo;s another way to ask you,</p>
<p>what are the limits of this approach?</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s a good question, yeah.</p>
<p>So I guess the whole idea of deep learning</p>
<p>is that there&rsquo;s something there to learn.</p>
<p>If the data is totally random,</p>
<p>just produced by random number generators,</p>
<p>then we&rsquo;re not gonna find a useful rule</p>
<p>because there isn&rsquo;t one.</p>
<p>So the extreme of having a rule is like knowing Newton&rsquo;s law.</p>
<p>If you hit a ball, it moves.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s where you had laws of physics.</p>
<p>Newton and Einstein and other great, great people</p>
<p>have found those laws and laws of the distribution</p>
<p>of oil in an underground thing.</p>
<p>I mean, so engineers, petroleum engineers understand</p>
<p>how oil will sit in an underground basin.</p>
<p>So there were rules.</p>
<p>Now, the new idea of artificial intelligence is</p>
<p>learn the rules instead of figuring out the rules</p>
<p>with help from Newton or Einstein.</p>
<p>The computer is looking for the rules.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s another step.</p>
<p>But if there are no rules at all</p>
<p>that the computer could find,</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s totally random data, well, you&rsquo;ve got nothing.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got no science to discover.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an automated search for the underlying rules.</p>
<p>Yeah, search for the rules.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>And there will be a lot of random parts.</p>
<p>A lot of, I mean, I&rsquo;m not knocking random</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s there.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of randomness built in,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s gotta be some basic.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost always signal, right?</p>
<p>In most things.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s gotta be some signal, yeah.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s all noise, then you&rsquo;re not gonna get anywhere.</p>
<p>Well, this world around us does seem to be,</p>
<p>does seem to always have a signal of some kind.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>To be discovered.</p>
<p>Right, that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>So what excites you more?</p>
<p>We just talked about a little bit of application.</p>
<p>What excites you more, theory</p>
<p>or the application of mathematics?</p>
<p>Well, for myself, I&rsquo;m probably a theory person.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not, I&rsquo;m speaking here pretty freely about applications,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m not the person who really,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a physicist or a chemist or a neuroscientist.</p>
<p>So for myself, I like the structure</p>
<p>and the flat subspaces</p>
<p>and the relation of matrices, columns to rows.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my part in the spectrum.</p>
<p>So really, science is a big spectrum of people</p>
<p>from asking practical questions</p>
<p>and answering them using some math,</p>
<p>then some math guys like myself who are in the middle of it</p>
<p>and then the geniuses of math and physics and chemistry</p>
<p>who are finding fundamental rules</p>
<p>and then doing the really understanding nature.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s incredible.</p>
<p>At its lowest, simplest level,</p>
<p>maybe just a quick in broad strokes from your perspective,</p>
<p>where does linear algebra sit as a subfield of mathematics?</p>
<p>What are the various subfields that you think about</p>
<p>in relation to linear algebra?</p>
<p>So the big fields of math are algebra as a whole</p>
<p>and problems like calculus and differential equations.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a second, quite different field.</p>
<p>Then maybe geometry deserves to be thought of</p>
<p>as a different field to understand the geometry</p>
<p>of high dimensional surfaces.</p>
<p>So I think, am I allowed to say this here?</p>
<p>I think this is where personal view comes in.</p>
<p>I think math, we&rsquo;re thinking about undergraduate math,</p>
<p>what millions of students study.</p>
<p>I think we overdo the calculus at the cost of the algebra,</p>
<p>at the cost of linear.</p>
<p>So you have this talk titled Calculus Versus Linear Algebra.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>And you say that linear algebra wins.</p>
<p>So can you dig into that a little bit?</p>
<p>Why does linear algebra win?</p>
<p>Right, well, okay, the viewer is gonna think</p>
<p>this guy is biased.</p>
<p>Not true, I&rsquo;m just telling the truth as it is.</p>
<p>Yeah, so I feel linear algebra is just a nice part of math</p>
<p>that people can get the idea of.</p>
<p>They can understand something that&rsquo;s a little bit abstract</p>
<p>because once you get to 10 or 100 dimensions</p>
<p>and very, very, very useful,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s happened in my lifetime</p>
<p>is the importance of data,</p>
<p>which does come in matrix form.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s really set up for algebra.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not set up for differential equation.</p>
<p>And let me fairly add probability,</p>
<p>the ideas of probability and statistics</p>
<p>have become very, very important, have also jumped forward.</p>
<p>So, and that&rsquo;s different from linear algebra,</p>
<p>quite different.</p>
<p>So now we really have three major areas to me,</p>
<p>calculus, linear algebra, matrices,</p>
<p>and probability statistics.</p>
<p>And they all deserve an important place.</p>
<p>And calculus has traditionally had a lion&rsquo;s share</p>
<p>of the time.</p>
<p>A disproportionate share.</p>
<p>It is, thank you, disproportionate, that&rsquo;s a good word.</p>
<p>Of the love and attention from the excited young minds.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I know it&rsquo;s hard to pick favorites,</p>
<p>but what is your favorite matrix?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s my favorite matrix?</p>
<p>Okay, so my favorite matrix is square, I admit it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a square bunch of numbers</p>
<p>and it has twos running down the main diagonal.</p>
<p>And on the next diagonal,</p>
<p>so think of top left to bottom right,</p>
<p>twos down the middle of the matrix</p>
<p>and minus ones just above those twos</p>
<p>and minus ones just below those twos</p>
<p>and otherwise all zeros.</p>
<p>So mostly zeros, just three nonzero diagonals coming down.</p>
<p>What is interesting about it?</p>
<p>Well, all the different ways it comes up.</p>
<p>You see it in engineering,</p>
<p>you see it as analogous in calculus to second derivative.</p>
<p>So calculus learns about taking the derivative,</p>
<p>the figuring out how much, how fast something&rsquo;s changing.</p>
<p>But second derivative, now that&rsquo;s also important.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how fast the change is changing,</p>
<p>how fast the graph is bending, how fast it&rsquo;s curving.</p>
<p>And Einstein showed that that&rsquo;s fundamental</p>
<p>to understand space.</p>
<p>So second derivatives should have a bigger place in calculus.</p>
<p>Second, my matrices,</p>
<p>which are like the linear algebra version</p>
<p>of second derivatives are neat in linear algebra.</p>
<p>Yeah, just everything comes out right with those guys.</p>
<p>Beautiful.</p>
<p>What did you learn about the process of learning</p>
<p>by having taught so many students math over the years?</p>
<p>Ooh, that is hard.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll have to admit here that I&rsquo;m not really a good teacher</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t get into the exam part.</p>
<p>The exam is the part of my life that I don&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>and grading them and giving the students A or B or whatever.</p>
<p>I do it because I&rsquo;m supposed to do it,</p>
<p>but I tell the class at the beginning,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if they believe me.</p>
<p>Probably they don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I tell the class, I&rsquo;m here to teach you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m here to teach you math and not to grade you.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re thinking, okay, this guy is gonna,</p>
<p>when is he gonna give me an A minus?</p>
<p>Is he gonna give me a B plus?</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>What have you learned about the process of learning?</p>
<p>Of learning.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, maybe to give you a legitimate answer</p>
<p>about learning, I should have paid more attention</p>
<p>to the assessment, the evaluation part at the end.</p>
<p>But I like the teaching part at the start.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the sexy part.</p>
<p>To tell somebody for the first time about a matrix, wow.</p>
<p>Is there, are there moments,</p>
<p>so you are teaching a concept,</p>
<p>are there moments of learning that you just see</p>
<p>in the student&rsquo;s eyes?</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need to look at the grades.</p>
<p>But you see in their eyes that you hook them,</p>
<p>that you connect with them in a way where,</p>
<p>you know what, they fall in love</p>
<p>with this beautiful world of math.</p>
<p>They see that it&rsquo;s got some beauty there.</p>
<p>Or conversely, that they give up at that point</p>
<p>is the opposite.</p>
<p>The dark could say that math, I&rsquo;m just not good at math.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna walk away.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Maybe because of the approach in the past,</p>
<p>they were discouraged, but don&rsquo;t be discouraged.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s too good to miss.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, if I&rsquo;m teaching a big class,</p>
<p>do I know when, I think maybe I do.</p>
<p>Sort of, I mentioned at the very start,</p>
<p>the four fundamental subspaces</p>
<p>and the structure of the fundamental theorem</p>
<p>of linear algebra.</p>
<p>The fundamental theorem of linear algebra.</p>
<p>That is the relation of those four subspaces,</p>
<p>those four spaces.</p>
<p>Yeah, so I think that, I feel that the class gets it.</p>
<p>At length.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What advice do you have to a student</p>
<p>just starting their journey in mathematics today?</p>
<p>How do they get started?</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, that&rsquo;s hard.</p>
<p>Well, I hope you have a teacher, professor,</p>
<p>who is still enjoying what he&rsquo;s doing,</p>
<p>what he&rsquo;s teaching.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re still looking for new ways to teach</p>
<p>and to understand math.</p>
<p>Cause that&rsquo;s the pleasure,</p>
<p>the moment when you see, oh yeah, that works.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s less about the material you study,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s more about the source of the teacher</p>
<p>being full of passion.</p>
<p>Yeah, more about the fun.</p>
<p>Yeah, the moment of getting it.</p>
<p>But in terms of topics, linear algebra?</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s my topic,</p>
<p>but oh, there&rsquo;s beautiful things in geometry to understand.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s wonderful is that in the end,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a pattern, there are rules</p>
<p>that are followed in biology as there are in every field.</p>
<p>You describe the life of a mathematician</p>
<p>as 100% wonderful.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Except for the grade stuff.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And the grades.</p>
<p>Except for grades.</p>
<p>Yeah, when you look back at your life,</p>
<p>what memories bring you the most joy and pride?</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s a good question.</p>
<p>I certainly feel good when I,</p>
<p>maybe I&rsquo;m giving a class in 1806,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s MIT&rsquo;s linear algebra course that I started.</p>
<p>So sort of, there&rsquo;s a good feeling that,</p>
<p>okay, I started this course,</p>
<p>a lot of students take it, quite a few like it.</p>
<p>Yeah, so I&rsquo;m sort of happy</p>
<p>when I feel I&rsquo;m helping make a connection</p>
<p>between ideas and students,</p>
<p>between theory and the reader.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s, I get a lot of very nice messages</p>
<p>from people who&rsquo;ve watched the videos and it&rsquo;s inspiring.</p>
<p>I just, I&rsquo;ll maybe take this chance to say thank you.</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s millions of students</p>
<p>who you&rsquo;ve taught and I am grateful to be one of them.</p>
