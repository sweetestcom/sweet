Boone good morning</p><p>yes so I you already helped me lose all</p><p>my and reverse my diabetes said to my</p><p>even see is now 5.5 great but this the</p><p>question is for my wife she was</p><p>diagnosed with celiac i think her</p><p>brother also had has it so the question</p><p>was how what is the best way to heal</p><p>that nutritionally and the second</p><p>polling question is that she when she</p><p>wakes up in the morning her face is</p><p>small and or like puffy what are the</p><p>causes of that and then how out of it is</p><p>all that that&rsquo;s okay quick question</p><p>before they put you on mute is she on</p><p>keto and intimate lasting yeah so she&rsquo;s</p><p>falling back my example I had lost 11</p><p>pounds so he was very excited as well</p><p>she started 3 months ago but her</p><p>progress is like slow</p><p>she is like 14 pounds down but she like</p><p>she looks the same she looks still looks</p><p>puffy like okay all right good so let me</p><p>just have someone put you on pause as I</p><p>answer that and you know I can get in</p><p>trouble for helping too many people so</p><p>just realize that you know I&rsquo;m just</p><p>sharing you kind of advice and what to</p><p>eat and then your body will heal itself</p><p>so that way I&rsquo;m out of the picture with</p><p>healing anyone but anyway thanks for the</p><p>question so silly ik there&rsquo;s damage in</p><p>the intestines so there&rsquo;s a couple</p><p>things that will actually help heal the</p><p>intestines definitely chlorophyll you</p><p>might want to try the wheatgrass juice</p><p>powder because it&rsquo;s loaded with</p><p>chlorophyll add water drink that it</p><p>helps heal the area the inflammations</p><p>probably initially create work was</p><p>created from high insulin and probably</p><p>even some some grains and you know</p><p>refined carbohydrates so now it&rsquo;s a</p><p>you&rsquo;re in the process of healing it</p><p>there&rsquo;s a couple things that you want to</p><p>do add chlorophyll</p><p>a lot of greens a lot of vitamin C not</p><p>from a supplement though get it from</p><p>food bell peppers awesome awesome</p><p>awesome cabbage really good fermented</p><p>food sauerkraut really beneficial but I</p><p>like the wheatgrass juice powder you got</p><p>to take that for a while to help heal</p><p>the inner lining there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s when</p><p>you actually have high sugar or high</p><p>insulin you will get damage to the</p><p>inside of the artery the inside of the</p><p>colon the nerves the kidney in the brain</p><p>if there&rsquo;s low levels of nutrients in</p><p>your body especially b1 so the B</p><p>vitamins are actually very very</p><p>important in healing and reversing the</p><p>intestine so it I think what you should</p><p>do is you should put around that bend fo</p><p>to mean I&rsquo;ve talked about in other</p><p>videos been boat to mean it&rsquo;s a fat side</p><p>will be vitamin that would be one that</p><p>would be really good for her now as far</p><p>as the the puffy face there has to be</p><p>something right now that is either she&rsquo;s</p><p>sensitive to food wise and if not then</p><p>just keep doing this and give it more</p><p>time especially if she&rsquo;s lost weight and</p><p>she&rsquo;s doing better</p><p>that being said intermittent fasting</p><p>more strict like less frequent meals are</p><p>gonna help the face as well on the skin</p><p>so if you can get her down to one meal a</p><p>day I think she&rsquo;ll probably see the most</p><p>benefit for the skin</p><p>all right thanks Sanjay we&rsquo;re gonna go</p><p>to Thomas from Long Island</p><p>go ahead Thomas you had a question about</p><p>dr. Byrd good morning well yes I first I</p><p>wanted to thank you up front I&rsquo;ve been</p><p>doing intermittent fasting one meal a</p><p>day now for two and a half months Wow</p><p>and I no longer take insulin and I no</p><p>longer take glucosamine and I no longer</p><p>take my blood pressure medicine actually</p><p>it slowed down Wow so thank you you&rsquo;re</p><p>welcome</p><p>I do take your gall bladder formula and</p><p>your insulin support and now that I&rsquo;m</p><p>doing the one meal a day can I take the</p><p>insulin support during the day and not</p><p>break the fast yes you can and by the</p><p>way any supplements like that will not</p><p>break the fast</p><p>just FYI include including nutritional</p><p>use back that&rsquo;s including nutritional</p><p>yeast there&rsquo;s just not enough calories</p><p>to break the fast at all and I&rsquo;m glad</p><p>that you&rsquo;re taking that because if</p><p>you&rsquo;ve been a diabetic what happens it&rsquo;s</p><p>like you this is gonna actually in any</p><p>diabetics that are listening the B</p><p>vitamins especially b1 in nutritional</p><p>yeast is vital vital vital as I&rsquo;m</p><p>studying the research on this you can</p><p>actually reverse a lot of the damage in</p><p>fact if you have enough b1 in the body</p><p>you&rsquo;ll have less side effects from high</p><p>sugar high insulin but here&rsquo;s the</p><p>problem the medication that people are</p><p>taking for diabetes type 2 actually</p><p>creates of b1 deficiency setting you up</p><p>for more symptoms and that&rsquo;s why another</p><p>big symptom on metformin for example or</p><p>glucophage is on the box they have a</p><p>black label because it causes something</p><p>called lactic acidosis as a side effect</p><p>well guess what b1 will counter that</p><p>that&rsquo;s the remedy for lactic acidosis so</p><p>again it comes back to that b1 it&rsquo;s such</p><p>an important nutrient and the way that</p><p>you would become deficient in that is by</p><p>consuming refined carbohydrates in the</p><p>form of breads pasta cereal crackers</p><p>biscuits and white sugar and white rice</p><p>because it takes b1 to metabolize glue</p><p>carbohydrates so if you so if you take</p><p>the refined version it&rsquo;ll deplete you of</p><p>your b1 and then you&rsquo;ll have a lot of</p><p>problems alright doc can I ask a</p><p>follow-up questions please yeah sure go</p><p>ahead</p><p>umm at the end of my meal you know it&rsquo;s</p><p>all vegetables and pickles bone broth</p><p>etc I get two for eggs</p><p>do I need any additional protein after</p><p>that or the floor eggs sufficient no</p><p>your that&rsquo;s a complete protein and</p><p>instead of adding more protein and</p><p>that&rsquo;s sufficient that&rsquo;s a good amount I</p><p>would add a little bit of fat if you</p><p>need it so and that&rsquo;s really the the</p><p>thing that you can increase especially</p><p>if you&rsquo;re not satisfied if you maybe you</p><p>don&rsquo;t want to lose this much weight or</p><p>whatever</p><p>fat is what you go up with a little more</p><p>vegetable but not your protein keep your</p><p>protein for X&rsquo;s I think it&rsquo;s a really</p><p>good amount for you good question thanks</p><p>Thomas let&rsquo;s go to Ken from San Antonio</p><p>San Antonio had a question about</p><p>concussion yes I had a question about</p><p>concussion and whiplash from automobile</p><p>accident and also want to ask about skin</p><p>problems like basal skin cells things</p><p>like that okay so was it a front-end</p><p>collision or a rear-end collision</p><p>yep both both so you got what was first</p><p>was the front would you hit something or</p><p>did something hit you first or</p><p>concussion doc concussion right but in</p><p>the 2a who had two accidents one rear</p><p>one front oh two separate okay did your</p><p>head hit the wind the windshield or the</p><p>steering column no airbags went off in</p><p>the front-end collision and a rear-end</p><p>collision no didn&rsquo;t hit anything because</p><p>of seat belts okay so I&rsquo;m gonna let&rsquo;s</p><p>talk about that first so I have a video</p><p>it&rsquo;s on head injuries just go type in</p><p>YouTube dr. Berg and head injuries</p><p>because what happens when you have this</p><p>impact to the head it creates a lot of</p><p>stress and tension in the skull is that</p><p>there&rsquo;s a technique I show you to help</p><p>release that and it&rsquo;s quite amazing</p><p>because it your head will feel like you</p><p>have more space and you&rsquo;ll sleep better</p><p>now the problem is the whiplash you had</p><p>a double whiplash when you get hit from</p><p>behind what happens the first motion is</p><p>your head goes back really fast and it</p><p>tears and damages the tiny ligaments on</p><p>the front part of your vertebra okay</p><p>it&rsquo;s scars and then when you hit front</p><p>end piece you damage the back so you</p><p>have a double whammy so there&rsquo;s probably</p><p>some scar tissue in the upper neck part</p><p>I&rsquo;m gonna recommend that you get that</p><p>massage tool I have and use that on your</p><p>neck</p><p>looks like this right here and you can</p><p>put this in the back part and you can</p><p>work on the different vertebras and you</p><p>sit back to keep the the the cervical</p><p>spine nice and curved it&rsquo;ll give you</p><p>relief and then you work on the muscles</p><p>up underneath your clavicle because when</p><p>you went back you kind of tore these two</p><p>and this can create a lot of tension and</p><p>later in life you have a lot of</p><p>stiffness in the neck and difficult in</p><p>pain so this is a really good tool that</p><p>I created for myself from my whiplash</p><p>injuries that I had so and I think I&rsquo;d</p><p>also have some videos on whiplash itself</p><p>you can watch that but it&rsquo;s you&rsquo;re gonna</p><p>have to probably do both techniques</p><p>because you had a double with whiplash</p><p>unfortunately okay now as far as the the</p><p>basal scale I&rsquo;m cell skin issue I think</p><p>the absolute best thing and this kind of</p><p>goes counter what a lot of people say is</p><p>don&rsquo;t be afraid to get about some</p><p>vitamin D from the Sun don&rsquo;t completely</p><p>stay out in the Sun I would get a little</p><p>about Emma D if you&rsquo;re concerned about</p><p>that then just take vitamin D vitamin D</p><p>is really important in to help</p><p>countering skin issues with the certain</p><p>skin cancer the other thing that I think</p><p>would help you greatly is to do hardcore</p><p>in a minute fasting because you&rsquo;re gonna</p><p>see that you&rsquo;re going to recycle old</p><p>damaged proteins that could potentially</p><p>trigger the cancer cell and so this puts</p><p>your immune system back into line it</p><p>actually supports healthy cells and and</p><p>then with the Kido by dropping sugar</p><p>then that way you won&rsquo;t feed any cancer</p><p>that&rsquo;s could be existing on top of that</p><p>I would recommend on a regular basis</p><p>basis consuming either regular garlic or</p><p>black garlic in a tablet form because</p><p>garlic is is hands-down the the number</p><p>one most powerful remedy to help with</p><p>anti cancer and help with cancer and</p><p>anti-cancer properties so garlic is and</p><p>in thing I like about black garlic is</p><p>that you can consume more of it without</p><p>any</p><p>a digestive issue its kind of fermented</p><p>alright thanks Ken let&rsquo;s go to John from</p><p>Indiana India lat Indianapolis six year</p><p>old on Kido blood Sugar&rsquo;s elevated go</p><p>ahead John you had a question</p><p>good morning I&rsquo;ve been I&rsquo;ve just started</p><p>on this kind of Morrible look a very low</p><p>carb design a purity to jannecke diet</p><p>and you know I I tried to go at least</p><p>two hours between my last meal of the</p><p>day and my first meal of the next day</p><p>and when I wake up in the morning I just</p><p>decided to try and check my blood</p><p>Sugar&rsquo;s to see where they were and</p><p>yesterday they were my blood sugar was</p><p>166 that in the middle of the afternoon</p><p>after I had eaten my first meal it was</p><p>down to 91 and I watched him I saw a</p><p>video when which you talked about</p><p>elevated blood sugars on keto and can</p><p>you kind of explain that yes absolutely</p><p>this is a really important point so if</p><p>anyone&rsquo;s checked out check right back</p><p>and just kind of catch this data right</p><p>here we know the majority of the</p><p>population has high insulin the purpose</p><p>of high insulin is to lower blood</p><p>Sugar&rsquo;s high insulin is more damaging</p><p>than high sugar</p><p>as you do Quito in a minute fasting you</p><p>help to lower insulin the thing that&rsquo;s</p><p>pushing the blood sugar down well guess</p><p>what&rsquo;s gonna happen as you&rsquo;re</p><p>transitioning into this face that</p><p>powerful high level of fasting insulin</p><p>starts to come down we no longer have</p><p>the push down wave to push the blood</p><p>sugar down and it may come up a little</p><p>bit as you kind of adapt to Quito that&rsquo;s</p><p>not gonna be a problem because it&rsquo;s</p><p>gonna eventually come down it&rsquo;s just</p><p>it&rsquo;s just the nature of what&rsquo;s happening</p><p>your by suggesting you&rsquo;re having much</p><p>less insulin in the system which is good</p><p>and you can even get a test you can go</p><p>get something called Homa - i our Homa -</p><p>i our that&rsquo;s a fasting insulin test and</p><p>fasting glucose test and they&rsquo;ll be able</p><p>to look at your insulin resistance and</p><p>that if you wanted a test but just give</p><p>it more time keep working towards</p><p>shortening the eating window keep</p><p>working towards keeping your carbs lower</p><p>and lower and this problem will improve</p><p>greatly okay don&rsquo;t forget your greens</p><p>with all the potassium - to help heal</p><p>that system good question them thanks</p><p>John let&rsquo;s go to Vivian from California</p><p>gastric sleeve</p><p>go ahead Vivian hi yes thank you for</p><p>taking my call I&rsquo;ve heard your your</p><p>podcast on gastric bypass but I haven&rsquo;t</p><p>heard you address the gastric sleeve yet</p><p>which so I still have eighty they&rsquo;ve</p><p>removed eighty five percent of my</p><p>stomach as opposed to bypassing my</p><p>stomach so I still absorb nutrients so</p><p>my biggest issue is I&rsquo;m trying to go to</p><p>one meal a day but like yesterday I was</p><p>only able to get in about 500 calories</p><p>with that one meal and definitely didn&rsquo;t</p><p>hit my goals as far as protein and fat</p><p>either yes that&rsquo;s a really good question</p><p>Vivian because you&rsquo;re not dealing with</p><p>the full capacity of your stomach so</p><p>there&rsquo;s two things you need to know</p><p>about that number one because you&rsquo;re</p><p>doing in a minute fasting the</p><p>requirement for pro</p><p>vegetables and nutrients in the</p><p>vegetables micronutrients and</p><p>macronutrients the requirements are a</p><p>lot less you&rsquo;re not going to need as</p><p>much now that being said there&rsquo;s two</p><p>things about that one is that you down</p><p>to 500 calories okay it&rsquo;s hard to get</p><p>all the nutrients you need in the 500</p><p>calories even if you&rsquo;re doing one meal a</p><p>day so what you may want to do because</p><p>you&rsquo;re limited by the full capacity of</p><p>the stomach is to eat and then maybe</p><p>wait like an hour and have any eat some</p><p>more so that way at least you&rsquo;re at like</p><p>maybe 900 calories if possible so you</p><p>can actually see you&rsquo;re not feeling so</p><p>stuffed now I think the other thing that</p><p>you&rsquo;re gonna have to pay attention to is</p><p>there&rsquo;s a couple categories of nutrients</p><p>that you&rsquo;re probably gonna have to take</p><p>to enhance what you&rsquo;re already doing</p><p>one is the trace minerals liquid</p><p>plant-based trace minerals vital because</p><p>you can take them in some water and</p><p>drink that and that way you&rsquo;re gonna</p><p>make sure you don&rsquo;t miss any nutrients</p><p>and then the second thing is to be</p><p>vitamins so if you do nutritional yeast</p><p>you get them into tablets and then the</p><p>trace minerals I think you&rsquo;re gonna be</p><p>fine I think it&rsquo;d be totally fine and</p><p>you may need a little bit outside of</p><p>vinegar or acidifies for the stomach to</p><p>then get your pH perect so you can</p><p>absorb b12 and the protein you&rsquo;re eating</p><p>but I think you&rsquo;re gonna be I think</p><p>you&rsquo;re gonna be successful with that</p><p>okay okay perfect</p><p>all right thanks hey by the way we&rsquo;ve</p><p>got quite a few folks on social media</p><p>that have some questions if you&rsquo;d like</p><p>to thank you for yet ask me some</p><p>questions in social media would we what</p><p>do we have and where are they from</p><p>alright from YouTube Susan I don&rsquo;t I</p><p>forgot to know where she&rsquo;s from but</p><p>she&rsquo;s having heart palpitations on the</p><p>keto diet and would like to know why</p><p>okay heart palpitations that&rsquo;s usually a</p><p>potassium deficiency in which case you</p><p>want to enhance that with a good</p><p>electrolyte powder with high</p><p>potassium I I do have something that</p><p>would handle that if you were to take</p><p>that and that will actually really help</p><p>you now that usually works like ninety</p><p>percent of the time because anything</p><p>electrically with the heart especially</p><p>because it&rsquo;s a pacemaker whether it&rsquo;s</p><p>fibrillation or increased pulse rate or</p><p>palpitations will be improved with</p><p>minerals electrolytes okay</p><p>especially potassium so keep your</p><p>vegetables high but there&rsquo;s one more</p><p>thing that it could be if you have</p><p>bloating if you&rsquo;re not used to digesting</p><p>more fats or consuming those fats our</p><p>larger amounts of fats I found that the</p><p>bloating will kind of back up the</p><p>gallbladder and liver a little bit and</p><p>press on the heart and give you a little</p><p>palpitation so I have found that so if</p><p>the electrolytes don&rsquo;t hundred percent</p><p>handle it then it&rsquo;s your gallbladder</p><p>that you need to support and just kind</p><p>of adjust the fats and I have a video on</p><p>gallbladder flush using manual therapy</p><p>you can actually kind of massage it and</p><p>get it to flow better and I think those</p><p>two things totally handle okay now it&rsquo;s</p><p>great and by the way one more Leah we&rsquo;ve</p><p>got a lot more but let&rsquo;s take one before</p><p>we go back to the tall&rsquo;s leah has lost</p><p>86 pounds on Lido fantastic but she has</p><p>no sores and would like to know if</p><p>there&rsquo;s any correlation between the keto</p><p>diet and that problem well usually</p><p>that&rsquo;s a vitamin C deficiency now there</p><p>could be a virus coming out of remission</p><p>that can sometimes you get these little</p><p>viruses that can have like a little did</p><p>you say nose sores or coal sores nose</p><p>and her nose okay yeah that usually</p><p>could be either either a virus coming</p><p>out of remission due to stress or it</p><p>could be a vitamin C deficiency</p><p>especially if there&rsquo;s a little bleeding</p><p>there in which case bell peppers and</p><p>cabbage would be the two sources and</p><p>where our sauerkraut would be the best</p><p>sources of vitamin C for her I would do</p><p>that</p><p>sometimes she needs more vitamin D so</p><p>you can get some Sun but if it&rsquo;s a virus</p><p>then she needs something called mono</p><p>Lauren</p><p>the viruses tend to come out when you&rsquo;re</p><p>under stress and a lot of times people</p><p>get them on their nose sometimes like</p><p>I&rsquo;ll get them if I have a really</p><p>important speech that I have to give in</p><p>front of a thousand people I&rsquo;ll usually</p><p>get as it the night before rather than</p><p>the tip of my nose which I&rsquo;m like why</p><p>does it always happen right so and</p><p>sometimes it&rsquo;s in the inside so you can</p><p>have this virus that coming out of</p><p>Mission and create a lot of irritation</p><p>and you will know it if it&rsquo;s a virus</p><p>because it&rsquo;s kind of like a red sore</p><p>that can come and go on the same</p><p>location and you can&rsquo;t kill a virus all</p><p>you can do is put it back in remission</p><p>by keeping your stress low keeping</p><p>healthy so you have nothing to worry</p><p>about with viruses other than staying</p><p>healthy your whole life and keeping off</p><p>the sugar but mono Lauren is a good</p><p>remedy for viruses mono Lauren&rsquo;s extract</p><p>from coconut oil Steve can derful okay</p><p>good to know</p><p>all right good should we take a call</p><p>from let&rsquo;s see who&rsquo;s next in the lineup</p><p>is that Ramola I think Jennifer has been</p><p>on hold the longest from Long Island</p><p>let&rsquo;s talk to Jennifer Jennifer you&rsquo;re</p><p>on the line go ahead you&rsquo;d a question my</p><p>first week on and I feel the only thing</p><p>is I get hot flashes I get hot and cold</p><p>and I know I&rsquo;m not nowhere near</p><p>menopausal clean and applause oh is that</p><p>normal and I also wanted to know now</p><p>that I&rsquo;m in the ketosis how quickly will</p><p>I start losing the inches okay did you</p><p>have hot flashes before or now no okay</p><p>how old are you like I&rsquo;m 46</p><p>okay so right right okay so what happens</p><p>with hot flashes is there&rsquo;s a whole</p><p>little circuitry thing going on the</p><p>adrenal glands are supposed to back up</p><p>the ovaries during menopause and pre</p><p>menopause and sometimes women can have</p><p>pre menopause and there</p><p>my 40s so the best thing for you to do</p><p>is to support adrenal glands so I would</p><p>look at you know really check if there&rsquo;s</p><p>anything stress to stress in your body</p><p>okay that&rsquo;s number one and sometimes</p><p>it&rsquo;s like overdoing what exercise could</p><p>be or not sleeping so if that&rsquo;s not an</p><p>issue then when I would do I would type</p><p>dr. Berg stress webinar and go through</p><p>that webinar because I show people how</p><p>to pull stress and influence the body to</p><p>a state where it takes a lot of stress</p><p>off your adrenals and that is what the</p><p>most successful action to help off</p><p>lashes especially if you&rsquo;re not really</p><p>into menopause it&rsquo;s like a pre thing if</p><p>you are post menopause or in menopause</p><p>and how hot flash I would do it&rsquo;s called</p><p>estrogen balance and dim but for your</p><p>case I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re gonna need</p><p>that I think you just need to support</p><p>the adrenal now as far as when you&rsquo;re</p><p>gonna see progress what I want you to do</p><p>is I want you to get the concept wrap</p><p>your wits around the concept of get</p><p>healthy lose weight not lose weight to</p><p>get healthy forget the weight right now</p><p>look at energy improvement clothes are</p><p>they fitting looser are your cravings</p><p>going away that&rsquo;s really the most</p><p>important</p><p>are you less hungry between meals how is</p><p>your mood how is your tolerance to crazy</p><p>people how is your digestion how is your</p><p>skin those are the things you can start</p><p>to see change and it&rsquo;s sometimes it</p><p>takes a couple weeks to kick in there</p><p>and then it&rsquo;s gonna get better and</p><p>better and better as long as you combine</p><p>in a minute fasting with ketosis it&rsquo;s</p><p>the exact same time because then you&rsquo;re</p><p>maximizing the improvement okay alright</p><p>thanks for your call</p><p>all right Steve alrighty well I can&rsquo;t</p><p>wait we&rsquo;ve got so much social media</p><p>action maybe we should take some of that</p><p>you should probably take some calls yeah</p><p>go ahead</p><p>all right so we&rsquo;ve got Tashi and she</p><p>works 12-hour shifts she doesn&rsquo;t heat</p><p>very much and she wants to know what</p><p>people like that can do when they have</p><p>no prep time to</p><p>really healthy foods for their Quito</p><p>experience so does she work a third</p><p>shift or just 12-hour shifts she doesn&rsquo;t</p><p>say just a 12-hour shift and therefore</p><p>just seems to have very little prep time</p><p>somehow hey guess what Steve guess what</p><p>that is gonna come in handy because the</p><p>program we&rsquo;re gonna recommend called</p><p>intermittent fasting means you&rsquo;re not</p><p>gonna eat as frequently so this is a</p><p>really easy thing especially if you&rsquo;re</p><p>traveling like all day somewhere and</p><p>your ereports</p><p>you know what we&rsquo;re not gonna you&rsquo;re not</p><p>gonna have to eat every hour and a half</p><p>to try to prep so what I would do I</p><p>would to make it really simple and this</p><p>is how I eat okay so eggs do not take a</p><p>long time you can boil eggs you can have</p><p>cheese you can have you know already</p><p>prepared meats and you can have eat that</p><p>and bring a salad I sometimes I&rsquo;ll just</p><p>have just lettuce and some dressing</p><p>olive oil vinegar at boom I&rsquo;m done nuts</p><p>peanut butter celery with peanut butter</p><p>peanut butter with hummus you can do</p><p>other types of vegetables like snap peas</p><p>or cut vegetables like bell peppers and</p><p>you can just down those so there&rsquo;s so</p><p>many things you can go at the grocery</p><p>store and get already prepared on the go</p><p>so you&rsquo;re not like spending all this</p><p>prep time I don&rsquo;t have time to spend</p><p>with prepping I I make my own food takes</p><p>me like two minutes and you can make it</p><p>the night before as well but yeah I</p><p>don&rsquo;t make these like sometimes you get</p><p>these cute Oh books that are so involved</p><p>so complex I don&rsquo;t do that and I have a</p><p>video by the way on how to do how to</p><p>spend less time cooking on keto so watch</p><p>that okay Steve let&rsquo;s make it it sounds</p><p>great and how about one more before we</p><p>go back to the phones and as you know</p><p>I&rsquo;m an inherently muscular but Bonnie</p><p>wants to know how she can gain more</p><p>muscle on keto yeah okay thanks Steve</p><p>because we know that you&rsquo;re pretty</p><p>physically fit specimen so you&rsquo;ve been</p><p>really working on your muscles but to to</p><p>improve muscles and this is kind of a</p><p>kind of a myth that people have they</p><p>they they automatically think</p><p>well they pretty much need to get more</p><p>protein because muscles are protein</p><p>however to build muscle you need a</p><p>balance of hormonal health and number</p><p>one when you do keto and in a minute</p><p>fasting you heal something called</p><p>insulin resistance</p><p>now when the purpose of insulin is to</p><p>absorb amino acids to build to</p><p>synthesize muscle but when you have</p><p>insulin resistance you don&rsquo;t it doesn&rsquo;t</p><p>work anymore even if you add more carbs</p><p>it doesn&rsquo;t work because the body is</p><p>trying to block insulin because you&rsquo;ve</p><p>eaten too many carbs and too much</p><p>insulin so just the fact by lowering</p><p>carbs you open the door for the amino</p><p>acids to go in there and make more</p><p>muscle protein okay the second thing</p><p>within a minute of fasting is that</p><p>you&rsquo;re gonna spike something called</p><p>human growth hormone and a female by his</p><p>13 hundred percent in the mail by two</p><p>thousand percent I mean you couldn&rsquo;t</p><p>even pay to get that amount of injection</p><p>artificially which comes with side</p><p>effects compared to doing in a minute</p><p>fasting so it&rsquo;s a huge spike of human</p><p>growth hormone which is a it actually</p><p>helps you build muscle preserves the</p><p>loss and breakdown of muscle okay and</p><p>there&rsquo;s two other things that you need</p><p>to focus on high quality deep delta-wave</p><p>sleep and the second thing is exercise</p><p>high intensity full body with lots of</p><p>rest between and then keeping your</p><p>stress down those are the things that</p><p>you&rsquo;re gonna do to build muscle moderate</p><p>amount of protein in your diet not too</p><p>much a lot and it last thing is that you</p><p>need potassium to build muscle so don&rsquo;t</p><p>go short on your vegetables consume that</p><p>and you&rsquo;ll actually have more potassium</p><p>to actually build more muscles that&rsquo;s</p><p>great doc and by the way I&rsquo;m glad that</p><p>was a gender-neutral advice because it</p><p>was Bowie not Bonnie so I guess it did</p><p>well so maybe we should hit the phones</p><p>yes let&rsquo;s let&rsquo;s go to UM is March necks</p><p>or take Marge Marge oh okay go ahead</p><p>Marge you had a question about metformin</p><p>for diabetes go ahead</p><p>yes sorry I got my blood work back and</p><p>the doctor called and said that my</p><p>pre-diabetes diabetic and it went from I</p><p>was already pre-diabetic it went from</p><p>five something to six something and he</p><p>wanted to put me on a low dose of the</p><p>metformin and the nurse said that they</p><p>are called up hog diarrhea and nausea so</p><p>we can intimate it and help me with the</p><p>pre-diabetes and I&rsquo;m also taking black</p><p>seed oil okay all right Marge listen my</p><p>mom&rsquo;s my mother&rsquo;s name is Marge so I</p><p>like your name here&rsquo;s what you need to</p><p>do here&rsquo;s what you need to do you this</p><p>is the exact platform to get more</p><p>knowledge to know what to eat because</p><p>unfortunately what I wish the doctor</p><p>would have done is got your foods</p><p>corrected because if your if you went</p><p>from a five to a six and he&rsquo;s talking</p><p>about a 1c which is an average of blood</p><p>sugars for three months it should be</p><p>like below a little below five or low</p><p>five six is kind of a little higher it&rsquo;s</p><p>not completely bad but then the put your</p><p>medication I mean here&rsquo;s the thing if</p><p>you do in a minute fasting you&rsquo;re gonna</p><p>find your a1c going right down because</p><p>frequent eating increases insulin you</p><p>cut the carbs out and and follow my</p><p>program your insulin your a1c is gonna</p><p>come right down probably within a month</p><p>if not sooner</p><p>so you&rsquo;re on the right track you&rsquo;re on</p><p>the right channel I think then once the</p><p>a1c comes down then you and your doctor</p><p>can discuss maybe getting you off that</p><p>stuff but the other thing you need to</p><p>take right now is because metformin</p><p>depletes b1 is take some nutritional</p><p>yeast you can get in a tablet form that</p><p>way you&rsquo;ll prevent the side effects</p><p>because metformin has a black label</p><p>which means it gives you severe side</p><p>effects like something called lactic</p><p>acidosis which you don&rsquo;t want to get</p><p>that so you need to get on the</p><p>nutritional yeast okay</p><p>all right March thanks for your</p><p>question let&rsquo;s go to Nick from Texas</p><p>Nick are you there yes sir hi dr. Berg</p><p>good first off thank you so much for all</p><p>the information you have I share your</p><p>channel with all my friends see so I</p><p>realize should it um I have been water</p><p>fasting the last 30 days now I did a lot</p><p>of research before I did it and I</p><p>started off keto fell off because of</p><p>financial hard times I got was 400</p><p>pounds one-sided members about wet water</p><p>fasting and I&rsquo;ve been water fasting for</p><p>30 days now and I&rsquo;ve lost actually 65</p><p>pounds now the point of the water fasts</p><p>wasn&rsquo;t to lose weight it was to let my</p><p>body heal itself so my question is after</p><p>30 days I&rsquo;ve seen a huge improvement in</p><p>my you know my happiness my my mobility</p><p>everything but I wanted to go to 40 days</p><p>there&rsquo;s something in my mind says forty</p><p>days is a good number to hit now a lot</p><p>of people recommend me that I just go</p><p>ahead and get off of it now thirty days</p><p>is enough go and getting the keto so I</p><p>could start doing more exercise and you</p><p>know all that but I feel great</p><p>so they continue to forty days or should</p><p>I go ahead in 30 days I&rsquo;ve seen enough</p><p>healing and progress then move on to the</p><p>key dough to continue my my journey ok</p><p>good question I&rsquo;ll have the producers</p><p>pitch in Passau I can give this answer</p><p>listen you got you have a lot of weight</p><p>to lose it&rsquo;s working for you you feel</p><p>great I think you can go to forty days</p><p>not a problem what I would recommend is</p><p>make sure that you at least consume</p><p>nutrients not synthetics but real</p><p>nutrition and here&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;d recommend</p><p>the electrolyte powder that I have be</p><p>that way you&rsquo;ll get a little bit aciem</p><p>because you&rsquo;ve got a you want the heart</p><p>needs these electrolytes right so you</p><p>have that it won&rsquo;t bump you out of</p><p>anything but it&rsquo;s just going to support</p><p>that and then the nutritional yeast</p><p>because that will give you the B</p><p>vitamins to also help and assist in this</p><p>process so because that&rsquo;s really we eat</p><p>food for nourishment or nutrients that&rsquo;s</p><p>the purpose so</p><p>you&rsquo;re not eating food you&rsquo;re just</p><p>drinking water so as long as you get the</p><p>nutrients I think and go longer and keep</p><p>feeling better and just prevent any</p><p>nutritional deficiencies because you&rsquo;re</p><p>probably running on distort vitamins</p><p>that are in your system but the problem</p><p>is the water soluble ones and some of</p><p>the minerals don&rsquo;t get stored like the</p><p>fat soluble ones so you&rsquo;re probably</p><p>running out but they&rsquo;re not going to</p><p>show up for a period of time so if you</p><p>want to extend it take those two</p><p>supplements I would take the electrolyte</p><p>powder and also the wheatgrass juice</p><p>powder okay do that and then let us know</p><p>how you do but good job on what you&rsquo;re</p><p>doing so far hey guys so I have a link</p><p>down below on something really cool it&rsquo;s</p><p>called a keto adaptation card and this</p><p>card gives you and you can cut it out on</p><p>a piece of paper you can download it it</p><p>gives you all the different remedies

tell you well why don&rsquo;t</p><p>we say hello to the world we&rsquo;ve got</p><p>viewers this morning from Istanbul</p><p>Serbia you can I think the Philippines</p><p>and Malaysia</p><p>not to mention all over our great nation</p><p>and now let&rsquo;s hit let&rsquo;s hit the calls</p><p>but whenever you feel like it we&rsquo;ve got</p><p>a ton of social media questions both on</p><p>Facebook and YouTube let&rsquo;s take two</p><p>calls and then we&rsquo;ll get some go to</p><p>social media okay and and I do wanted to</p><p>say I really really appreciate all of</p><p>your wonderful comments on YouTube and</p><p>Facebook with your results I am just</p><p>literally blown away I read them and so</p><p>I really appreciate you following</p><p>sharing and the great compliments that</p><p>you&rsquo;re giving me I appreciate that it&rsquo;s</p><p>just my pleasure okay so let&rsquo;s go to</p><p>Alan is a call best morning coffee</p><p>substitute</p><p>go ahead Alan good morning doctor</p><p>morning with us I&rsquo;ve just started the</p><p>keto diet and I&rsquo;m getting ready to go</p><p>back to work from Monday after being off</p><p>tour like seven eight weeks because of</p><p>osteoarthritis of my knee so right now I</p><p>drink coffee with a lot of coffee mate</p><p>hazelnut</p><p>you know creamer in it on my way to work</p><p>so I&rsquo;m looking I have a nutribullet and</p><p>I got all the vegetables and I&rsquo;ve bought</p><p>purchased some wondering what kind of</p><p>shakes can I make what&rsquo;s the best shake</p><p>I can make in the morning to replace</p><p>this sugary coffee that I&rsquo;m addicted to</p><p>in the morning I totally understand you</p><p>do you want to lose weight or just</p><p>maintain no lose okay I know but I think</p><p>you mentioned for every pound that we</p><p>lose it&rsquo;s how many pounds off the knee</p><p>and that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m striving for that&rsquo;s</p><p>right and then do you are you pretty</p><p>addicted to coffee I guess I am because</p><p>but I&rsquo;ll have my coffee in the morning</p><p>I&rsquo;m okay okay good let me give you a</p><p>couple good tips okay so I&rsquo;ll have the</p><p>producers put you on pause for a second</p><p>you wanted to use xylitol xylitol is the</p><p>best sweetener for coffee it won&rsquo;t taste</p><p>bad</p><p>it&rsquo;s your new sugar you&rsquo;re not gonna use</p><p>much you probably use a half a teaspoon</p><p>it should sweeten it fine get some</p><p>grass-fed whole cream whipping cream and</p><p>put it put that as your creamer keep in</p><p>your fridge that&rsquo;s what I do</p><p>works great and try to do one cup okay</p><p>smaller if possible so so that way you</p><p>do that now if you really want to take</p><p>it one step further which I highly</p><p>recommend get an organic coffee because</p><p>there are a lot of pesticides so organic</p><p>coffee grass-fed whipping cream if you</p><p>want to do half a nap that&rsquo;s fine and</p><p>then you put the xylitol in there your</p><p>it&rsquo;s over it&rsquo;s perfect that&rsquo;s all you</p><p>need to do now I also recommend for</p><p>those people that can&rsquo;t just drink one</p><p>they drink two or three or four or five</p><p>especially Italians so I recommend that</p><p>you get the matcha tea</p><p>okay a matcha tea that has some caffeine</p><p>in it not to be extreme but it gives you</p><p>some boost without the jitters and you</p><p>get all these great phytonutrients so</p><p>maca tree or much matcha or maca tea and</p><p>you mix the whole leaf in there and that</p><p>could be like after your first cup you</p><p>can drink those you&rsquo;re gonna you&rsquo;re</p><p>gonna have energy you&rsquo;re gonna feel good</p><p>and I think it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s a great way to</p><p>transition off of your addiction I&rsquo;m</p><p>sorry your coffee in the morning okay</p><p>all right thanks Alan good question</p><p>alright so we&rsquo;re gonna go to one more</p><p>caller before we go to social media</p><p>let&rsquo;s go to UM ramallah from texas</p><p>ramallah go ahead you&rsquo;re on the line hi</p><p>hi hi there</p><p>I&rsquo;ve been doing keto for eight months</p><p>I&rsquo;ve been following a lot of your videos</p><p>thank you but I&rsquo;m actually calling on</p><p>behalf of my sister she had acid reflux</p><p>as a young girl has a heart murmur and</p><p>you know since the surgery she&rsquo;s had you</p><p>know she&rsquo;s had to have a very strict</p><p>diet of you know nothing acidic no salt</p><p>and I know that the keto diet you know</p><p>lemon and salts are essential so how how</p><p>could she go about doing this diet</p><p>because she&rsquo;s incredibly overweight and</p><p>I know that this would greatly affect</p><p>her health she has high blood pressure</p><p>and I&rsquo;m pretty sure she&rsquo;s pre-diabetic</p><p>no she had surgery for acid reflux yeah</p><p>it was so bad that the valve in her</p><p>throat was actually dissolved she had it</p><p>for years and never told me she&rsquo;s</p><p>mentally disabled so she has a hard time</p><p>explaining herself but so she&rsquo;s been on</p><p>incredibly strict diet since then when</p><p>she&rsquo;s 18 she&rsquo;s in her 30s now okay</p><p>all right good question let me just put</p><p>you in pause for a second first thing we</p><p>need to do if there was an acid there</p><p>was surgery because there&rsquo;s acid reflux</p><p>there&rsquo;s at this point we probably can&rsquo;t</p><p>put acid back in because normally acid</p><p>reflux is low acid because then the</p><p>valve isn&rsquo;t closed so we have some heal</p><p>to do the absolute best remedy for her</p><p>on planet earth is the that raw</p><p>wheatgrass juice powder that I have and</p><p>you can mix it in water in a shaker and</p><p>have her drink that several times a day</p><p>on an empty stomach</p><p>that&rsquo;s gonna give her a lot of relief</p><p>and help give the chlorophyll to help</p><p>heal the inner lining of the intestinal</p><p>tract okay so that&rsquo;s like a very</p><p>important thing but here&rsquo;s the problem</p><p>because she had acid reflux that means</p><p>she had an imbalance and and I know she</p><p>probably doesn&rsquo;t have enough acid now I</p><p>know it sounds weird but she&rsquo;s probably</p><p>getting recruiting of the waste acids</p><p>coming up from the small intestine and</p><p>that is going to prevent her from</p><p>absorbing minerals and breaking down</p><p>protein and that&rsquo;s probably why she has</p><p>the heart murmur just because you can&rsquo;t</p><p>pull in all the neutral nutrition and</p><p>high blood pressure is really from high</p><p>insulin it&rsquo;s not really the salt and I</p><p>know they said chill out the salt</p><p>because we don&rsquo;t want to raise the blood</p><p>pressure but if what would she really</p><p>needs to do is heal by lowering insulin</p><p>that&rsquo;s gonna help the blood pressure the</p><p>lining of the stomach and but she&rsquo;s</p><p>gonna probably need a little sea salt to</p><p>actually add in there because if you go</p><p>low salt then you can&rsquo;t make kind of</p><p>chloric acid for the stomach so you can</p><p>digest so I would totally put her on the</p><p>keto in a minute fasting put a lot of</p><p>attention on in a minute fasting because</p><p>someone that has that digestive issue if</p><p>you eat less frequent it&rsquo;s gonna take a</p><p>huge stress off the system her blood</p><p>pressure will come down her pre-diabetes</p><p>will improve greatly but I think I think</p><p>you&rsquo;ll see dramatic changes if you do</p><p>that but the chlorophyll from the</p><p>wheatgrass is going to be the icing on</p><p>the cake I&rsquo;m sorry I shouldn&rsquo;t talk</p><p>about cake it&rsquo;s the meat and potatoes</p><p>now I won&rsquo;t talk about that either much</p><p>better alright good so let&rsquo;s go to the</p><p>social media see if we have any</p><p>questions there all right sounds great</p><p>we got tons of them Shaniqua on Facebook</p><p>wants to know if bullion cubes are</p><p>allowed on the keto diet doc yeah well</p><p>some are some aren&rsquo;t depending on you</p><p>have to read the ingredients because a</p><p>lot of times they&rsquo;ll put something</p><p>called modified food starch</p><p>okay that&rsquo;s MSG monosodium glutamate and</p><p>if that&rsquo;s the case you don&rsquo;t want that</p><p>that&rsquo;s gonna raise your insulin so read</p><p>the ingredients make sure it doesn&rsquo;t</p><p>have any of that in there but if it</p><p>doesn&rsquo;t have it in there go for it it&rsquo;ll</p><p>give you some nice salts and minerals</p><p>and you can do that not a problem okay</p><p>and then Michael appears to be in the</p><p>same boat and is wondering whether</p><p>coconut sugar is allowed on the keto</p><p>diet yeah</p><p>coconut sugar it&rsquo;s pretty high at least</p><p>it has a couple vitamins in it but it&rsquo;s</p><p>not allowed because it&rsquo;s gonna raise</p><p>your sugar all these like even coconut</p><p>water it&rsquo;s not good because it has a lot</p><p>of sugar in it what you could do is</p><p>coconut oil and you can do xylitol or we</p><p>throw 12 non GMO or stevia or monk fruit</p><p>but now I&rsquo;m sorry the coconut sugar has</p><p>to go we have to mix that Steve okay</p><p>well we will and then if Francis is</p><p>getting headaches on keto I&rsquo;m not sure</p><p>if she&rsquo;s blaming you but you would like</p><p>to know why okay I&rsquo;ll take full</p><p>responsibility</p><p>so the headaches on keto is primarily a</p><p>a blood sugar issue and so you want to</p><p>probably cut back on the transition</p><p>because I&rsquo;d probably ask her and I can&rsquo;t</p><p>ask her this but when she eats do the</p><p>headaches go away if that&rsquo;s the case</p><p>then we know it&rsquo;s a little blood blood</p><p>sugar situation and then you have to</p><p>back back back from the frequency of</p><p>intermittent fasting and maybe not fast</p><p>as frequent and gradually go into it but</p><p>the other thing that I would do if I</p><p>were you if you have headaches is I</p><p>would work on your gallbladder you can</p><p>use your hand press underneath the right</p><p>rib cage massage that 9 times out of 10</p><p>the headaches will go away because</p><p>there&rsquo;s a nerve from your gallbladder</p><p>that goes all the way up to the neck up</p><p>into the head especially the headaches</p><p>on the right side which they usually are</p><p>and it could mean you&rsquo;re just doing too</p><p>much fat so you have to cut back on that</p><p>but if you massage underneath the right</p><p>ribcage that usually will handle the</p><p>headaches Steve really click sound try</p><p>it no absolutely</p><p>and then Galia wants to know how</p><p>can know if she&rsquo;s a liver type a liver</p><p>body type for sure well the only real</p><p>true way to figure out if your liver</p><p>type is to do blood tests ultrasound to</p><p>see if there&rsquo;s a fatty liver see how bad</p><p>it is is there cirrhosis is there</p><p>inflammation that&rsquo;s really how you&rsquo;re</p><p>gonna know for sure but in the book I</p><p>talk about everyone needs to do the</p><p>basic healthy kedo inanimate fasting for</p><p>two weeks then we can add in the body</p><p>types</p><p>liver body type is is a little tweak to</p><p>the general plan for example liver types</p><p>don&rsquo;t do well on a lot of protein they</p><p>do very well on cruciferous vegetables</p><p>they do very well on large quantity of</p><p>organic vegetables they don&rsquo;t do well on</p><p>high amounts of cooked processed meat</p><p>they definitely didn&rsquo;t do well on grains</p><p>or sugars so that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s kind of how</p><p>you would know you&rsquo;d have to do those</p><p>tests you can kind of get a rough idea</p><p>from my book by the symptoms but these</p><p>are just kind of good guesses to have</p><p>you try things and see if it works if</p><p>you follow the protocol in that book on</p><p>the liver and it works then we know it</p><p>was a liver it&rsquo;s very easily to try one</p><p>thing and then if that doesn&rsquo;t work try</p><p>another because you&rsquo;re helping the</p><p>entire body if you do any of the body</p><p>type recommendations so it&rsquo;s you&rsquo;re not</p><p>going to make anything worse and and you</p><p>could be a combination so it&rsquo;s really</p><p>hard to know exactly because when one</p><p>organ goes down the other ones go down</p><p>too but the question is which ones the</p><p>primary ones ones the secondary alright</p><p>Steve alright that sounds great how</p><p>about one more before we go back to the</p><p>yeah the calls this is Liz from YouTube</p><p>candy keto diet helped me recover from</p><p>spinal stenosis yeah good question</p><p>spinal stenosis I don&rsquo;t have my skeleton</p><p>in here but it&rsquo;s the the spinal column</p><p>should be this big stenosis kind of goes</p><p>down like this so it you have a less of</p><p>a space in the spinal column and so</p><p>there&rsquo;s a lot of nerve pain and things</p><p>like that usually that comes that</p><p>comes from a combination of inflammation</p><p>in the ligaments and tendons that</p><p>surround the spinal column and sometimes</p><p>calcium buildup and scar tissue build up</p><p>around those areas if you do in a minute</p><p>fasting</p><p>that&rsquo;s probably the most important thing</p><p>you can put your body into a recycling</p><p>mode where it&rsquo;s actually going to take</p><p>this excess protein that you don&rsquo;t need</p><p>and recycle it and help stenosis and the</p><p>other thing to take is k2 vitamin k2</p><p>because that actually will clean up</p><p>calcium and sometimes I also recommend</p><p>an enzyme called Sarah pep case and</p><p>that&rsquo;s a great enzyme to to clean up old</p><p>scar tissue if there&rsquo;s been trauma and</p><p>your spine okay Sarah pepped ace</p><p>make sure you get the one that&rsquo;s over a</p><p>hundred thousand is take it a few times</p><p>a day on an empty stomach and that will</p><p>also help so we got k2 in a minute</p><p>fasting course keto was a given drop the</p><p>sugar drop the inflammation and that&rsquo;s</p><p>kind of all you need to do to get some</p><p>relief versus jump right to the surgery</p><p>all right and by the way we&rsquo;ve been well</p><p>represented in Asia but we don&rsquo;t want to</p><p>forget our listeners and viewers in</p><p>Vancouver Italy and the United Kingdom</p><p>wow that&rsquo;s awesome</p><p>that is awesome no we don&rsquo;t want to</p><p>forget those guys so thanks for being on</p><p>let&rsquo;s go to is Colleen already for a</p><p>question is that the one that we&rsquo;re</p><p>gonna go after next yes who&rsquo;s Colleen</p><p>Colleen from Alabama go ahead Colleen</p><p>hi good morning I&rsquo;ve seen it on one of</p><p>your videos and for the life of me</p><p>cannot find it</p><p>I have stairs in my house to go outside</p><p>up-and-down and sometimes when I&rsquo;m going</p><p>down my stair mostly coming up I have</p><p>that real heavy feeling in my thighs and</p><p>I know you touched on this and I can&rsquo;t</p><p>find it and I was wanting to know what</p><p>is problem okay so like I had this too I</p><p>remember as a</p><p>kid we lived in Wisconsin and he used to</p><p>snow like three feet and I was walking</p><p>in the snow as a kid and I noticed my</p><p>legs were like lead pile ed weights</p><p>heavy legs is an adrenal issue the</p><p>adrenal gland needs support I have a lot</p><p>of videos on the adrenal you could watch</p><p>those and apply what I show and that</p><p>that usually works a good portion of the</p><p>time however that being said there&rsquo;s one</p><p>more thing and that&rsquo;s a b1 deficiency</p><p>could also give you similar symptoms but</p><p>taking b1 also improves the adrenal so</p><p>that could be why it works because it</p><p>gets rid of lactic acid and the muscles</p><p>which make the muscles kind of heavier</p><p>and so you can get nutritional yeast and</p><p>try that and see if that doesn&rsquo;t help</p><p>you but definitely support the adrenals</p><p>and don&rsquo;t forget to do the healthy keto</p><p>and intermittent fasting okay thank you</p><p>so much you&rsquo;re welcome so then we have</p><p>sue bas from Malaysia you had a question</p><p>go ahead you&rsquo;re a question about fasting</p><p>and kidney a kidney question yes good</p><p>morning dr. Berg good morning my name is</p><p>my name is Abbas calling all the way</p><p>from Malaysia I just have two questions</p><p>to ask you yeah thank you doctor</p><p>I&rsquo;ve been following your videos for the</p><p>last six months and what has happened is</p><p>I was 158 kgs and by following your</p><p>videos and your advice I have dropped to</p><p>119 my question is I&rsquo;ve been fasting for</p><p>six days and on the seventh day at about</p><p>3 p.m. I will slowly break my fast and</p><p>and I will then continue the next day</p><p>and I&rsquo;ll start fasting again so it&rsquo;s</p><p>basically six days fasting and one day</p><p>eating my question is I mean I also</p><p>watched your videos and you asked me to</p><p>take the zinc magnesium together to</p><p>with apple cider a sea salt and</p><p>potassium so I&rsquo;m taking that every day</p><p>now my question is by picking all of</p><p>this is it right to carry on fasting six</p><p>days and one day because my out my</p><p>ultimate weight is 70 kgs because I&rsquo;m</p><p>557 so that&rsquo;s my first question my</p><p>second question is if I take the apple</p><p>cider vinegar together with all the the</p><p>the magnesium and zinc and stuff like</p><p>that will that all will that cause</p><p>kidney stones that is my actually my</p><p>main concern doctor okay</p><p>no the absolute vinegar will not cause</p><p>the kidney stones especially if you add</p><p>some lemon to the water because when</p><p>you&rsquo;re into this hardcore keto your pH</p><p>will become a little slightly more</p><p>acidic and there&rsquo;s a chance that your</p><p>uric acid levels could go up possibly in</p><p>which case you want to just have a</p><p>little lemon juice to counter that and</p><p>chill that out a bit but the potassium</p><p>that you take should help that too the</p><p>biggest thing with what you&rsquo;re doing I</p><p>think I think you&rsquo;re you want to look at</p><p>you want to make sure you&rsquo;re not</p><p>nutritionally deficient so as long as</p><p>your energy is high your hair is not</p><p>falling out you&rsquo;re not having any</p><p>symptoms and you&rsquo;re improving then</p><p>obviously you have enough reserve</p><p>vitamin wise but I still if I were you I</p><p>would take a high quality plant-based</p><p>trace mineral I would probably take an</p><p>electrolyte I would probably take a very</p><p>food based vitamin supplement that has</p><p>in it the fat Seibel once more I would</p><p>just take olive oil that would be better</p><p>just at least take those as you&rsquo;re doing</p><p>this to prevent any problems and lastly</p><p>the nutritional yeast tablets because</p><p>you need those B vitamins so I other</p><p>than that I think you can ride the wave</p><p>and keep doing it&rsquo;s working you&rsquo;re doing</p><p>it hardcore you&rsquo;re because think about</p><p>on the evolutionary track on our bodies</p><p>our highs we&rsquo;re not designed to eat</p><p>every hour and a half they were designed</p><p>to eat just like you&rsquo;re eating right now</p><p>you&rsquo;d be lucky if you ate every day</p><p>every week probably would eat and then</p><p>you eat for a couple days and you</p><p>wouldn&rsquo;t eat so I think our bodies could</p><p>tolerate that as long as you&rsquo;re taking</p><p>the nutrients because in the past we</p><p>probably had a lot more nutrient food</p><p>you need organ meats but now we&rsquo;re just</p><p>like so nutritionally deficient okay</p><p>thanks for your question</p><p>and all right doc how about one more</p><p>from our audience this one on YouTube</p><p>you&rsquo;ve you know answered some great</p><p>questions and I think we&rsquo;ve tossed you</p><p>some softballs not this time I&rsquo;m 60 and</p><p>have lost two inches in height can</p><p>intermittent fasting help me to regain</p><p>my height so we really wanted that in</p><p>width not high so it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s drinking in</p><p>the wrong location</p><p>so we&rsquo;re gonna have put you on the rack</p><p>and we&rsquo;re gonna stretch you now well it</p><p>sounds like you&rsquo;ve lost some some spaces</p><p>in your prior spinal column and with the</p><p>height and in fluid things like that</p><p>believe it or not I am guessing you&rsquo;re</p><p>an adult and that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s happened the</p><p>best thing to do would be to kind of do</p><p>things to rehydrate not not by drinking</p><p>water but what I&rsquo;m talking about getting</p><p>your hydration in your discs making sure</p><p>the protein is actually can come back</p><p>because really when you lose height it&rsquo;s</p><p>not just about calcium it&rsquo;s about the</p><p>protein in the bone that you lose and</p><p>also the soft tissue discs that you&rsquo;re</p><p>losing in which case you can greatly</p><p>heal that with in a minute fasting</p><p>that&rsquo;s like really really important and</p><p>high-quality food over a period of time</p><p>I promise that you&rsquo;re gonna grow but I</p><p>can say I probably slowed down the loss</p><p>of any more inches that you would be</p><p>shrinking okay and by the way if if you</p><p>have a child that&rsquo;s not growing a really</p><p>good remedy would be to put them on this</p><p>program that I&rsquo;m recommending and also</p><p>get a supplements from standard process</p><p>called pituitary</p><p>I used to use it a lot and practice and</p><p>seem like it really help kids grow</p><p>because it supports the pituitary it&rsquo;s</p><p>called pituitary and PMG from standard</p><p>process now we&rsquo;re going to go to Ashley</p><p>she had a question about</p><p>her mom go ahead Ashley from Memphis yes</p><p>hi after my mom mega eating a tomato</p><p>benign star somewhere along three</p><p>o&rsquo;clock every night and it feel like</p><p>spider web around her neck and she also</p><p>have a lock locking Cory when you walk</p><p>she fell on her tailbone about thirty</p><p>years ago and right now she&rsquo;s down</p><p>gallbladder formula k2 and the theory</p><p>reaping aid</p><p>electrolytes powders and for the meeting</p><p>request use powder first you know</p><p>nutritional is their pet paid and the</p><p>apple cider vinegar and chi-town is on</p><p>her way to do ketogenic diet in the past</p><p>she either three meals in the three bowl</p><p>of rice a day and now she is making a</p><p>big improvement she won both and writer</p><p>she divided into three meals and so</p><p>she&rsquo;s on her way to Quito and she only</p><p>either doing the other day she has no</p><p>appetite before for me okay alright so</p><p>here&rsquo;s what you do Ashley okay get her</p><p>off the rice get her off the rice the</p><p>fact that she doesn&rsquo;t want meat probably</p><p>tells me that she needs just to keep the</p><p>outside of vinegar and the and to help</p><p>her acidify the stomach but I would</p><p>actually layer on the couch she has</p><p>enough nutrition now and in addition to</p><p>put her on keto and I&rsquo;m gonna fasting do</p><p>some massage around underneath the right</p><p>rib cage in the left rib cage and the</p><p>reason for that it&rsquo;s gonna kind of</p><p>massage and help the flow of fluids that</p><p>go through the pancreas and the</p><p>gallbladder and you&rsquo;re gonna find that</p><p>the liver will drain better and that&rsquo;s</p><p>probably going to handle the itching</p><p>ultimately I think that&rsquo;s the only thing</p><p>you need to do and then get her instead</p><p>of doing three meals just do one meal</p><p>she&rsquo;s not hungry and put the leafy</p><p>greens in there and I think that itching</p><p>is gonna go away okay Ashley and I think</p><p>Steve had a question for his friend</p><p>right Steve you had a question for your</p><p>friend you always have questions of</p><p>course we know they&rsquo;re your questions</p><p>but maybe we&rsquo;ll take that next week</p><p>Steve oh that would be you know I&rsquo;m deep</p><p>deep into Quito so we&rsquo;ll discuss that</p><p>next week and that&rsquo;s not a McDonald&rsquo;s</p><p>cup beside me right yeah I have you</p><p>pegged out okay great so hey guys you</p><p>guys had some great questions I really</p><p>appreciate your watching these videos</p><p>have a wonderful weekend and I&rsquo;m gonna</p><p>see you next week same time same place</p><p>and I&rsquo;ll be in my studio have a good</p><p>[Music]</p></section><footer
