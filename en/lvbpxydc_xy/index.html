<p>Ôªøhey guys sorry for that we had some</p>
<p>temporary technical difficulties okay so</p>
<p>so getting right back to what we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna do here we&rsquo;re gonna actually</p>
<p>answer another question here before we</p>
<p>go to social media so Ian from</p>
<p>California had a question go ahead in</p>
<p>BOM hello thank you guys for taking my</p>
<p>call oh I very much appreciate what you</p>
<p>guys do here I&rsquo;ll just jump right into</p>
<p>it I&rsquo;ve been doing keto for about 14</p>
<p>months I started it 294 pounds and I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>down under 200 now so I&rsquo;m down about 95</p>
<p>oh wow yeah it&rsquo;s you know it&rsquo;s amazing I</p>
<p>feel like a brand new person I guess I</p>
<p>am a brand new person 11 of the last</p>
<p>pounds have been within the past three</p>
<p>months so you know I&rsquo;m slowing down and</p>
<p>tapering down my concern is my lipid</p>
<p>panel results so I could just rattle</p>
<p>these off for you back in back in August</p>
<p>I got it done and the total went from</p>
<p>265 to 281 to last week 344</p>
<p>triglycerides went from 68 to 46 to 40</p>
<p>last week HDL went from 44 to 52 to 61</p>
<p>and then LDL went from 200 a to 220 to</p>
<p>275 okay so you know the LDL and the</p>
<p>totals it went up but I went back and</p>
<p>watched your video talking about</p>
<p>cholesterol and I looked at the the</p>
<p>triglyceride HDL ratio which would be 40</p>
<p>over 61 which is 0.65 which is less than</p>
<p>2 what you say is great so I guess I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>just needing some words of wisdom from</p>
<p>dr. Burke well I&rsquo;m glad that you brought</p>
<p>this up because I was going to talk</p>
<p>about this topic anyway might as well</p>
<p>bring it up right now and so just listen</p>
<p>take notes okay you ready ready for this</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m ready okay good so here&rsquo;s the thing</p>
<p>guys I want to talk about why your</p>
<p>cholesterol could go up on a ketogenic</p>
<p>diet</p>
<p>first of all Karen um when you know what</p>
<p>LDL is bad yeah and what typically</p>
<p>people think when the LDL goes up when</p>
<p>you get your blood vessel you&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s your when you get a blood vessel</p>
<p>blood test</p>
<p>LDL up means that&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>and what is it doing to the body it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>hurting the body it&rsquo;s clogging up</p>
<p>arteries yeah yeah then you have to get</p>
<p>rid of all the fat in your diet okay</p>
<p>good so this that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s where it</p>
<p>actually is totally 100% 110% false that</p>
<p>is not how it works so let me explain</p>
<p>something guys so you got LDL so-called</p>
<p>bad cholesterol and HDL good cholesterol</p>
<p>there they&rsquo;re not even cholesterol</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re lipoproteins okay they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>proteins because the body can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>transport fat without a shuttle so if</p>
<p>you if you picture this Karen like you</p>
<p>have a Love Boat okay The Love Boat</p>
<p>Remember The Love Boat yes I loved it</p>
<p>okay so The Love Boat is like the LDL</p>
<p>okay because they&rsquo;re there shuttles so</p>
<p>LDL and HDL are two love boats one&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going out to sea and that is basically</p>
<p>the LDL and the one that&rsquo;s coming back</p>
<p>from sea back to the liver is the HDL</p>
<p>the so-called good cholesterol so that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>really there&rsquo;s shuttles so they&rsquo;re kind</p>
<p>of cruise liners right so if you take</p>
<p>take a look at lvl inside LDL you have</p>
<p>cargo the primary cargo is basically</p>
<p>triglycerides triglycerides that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>basically fuel for the body</p>
<p>those triglycerides are used for energy</p>
<p>to turn through ketones and fatty acids</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s the primary goal of LDL but</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s also some secondary goals in</p>
<p>there - there&rsquo;s cholesterol in there</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s fat soluble vitamins there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>antioxidants there&rsquo;s all sorts of stuff</p>
<p>so the primary purpose of that</p>
<p>cholesterol in the LDL the so called bad</p>
<p>cholesterol is to go and repair the</p>
<p>artery damage and because here&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>thing like people this idea that</p>
<p>cholesterol is like going out into the</p>
<p>body and then clogging things up no no</p>
<p>no no that&rsquo;s not how it works because</p>
<p>the lining of the arteries have little</p>
<p>receptors for LDL they&rsquo;re called LDL</p>
<p>receptors that reach out and grab the</p>
<p>cholesterol when they need it if there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>damage so the primary purpose of LDL is</p>
<p>to provide fuel and secondary purpose is</p>
<p>to help repair damage in the artery wall</p>
<p>so so Karen you think you the body makes</p>
<p>he&rsquo;ll do right right so if it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>considered bad why would your body make</p>
<p>it is it a mistake no I don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a reason for it there&rsquo;s a reason</p>
<p>your body has receptors for it so it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s actually reaching out and grabbing</p>
<p>it when you need it because the body</p>
<p>would not would much rather have like a</p>
<p>like a patch over a hole than an actual</p>
<p>hole in your wall right I mean you</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t want to necessarily have a</p>
<p>whole new wall you want to patch it up</p>
<p>so the cholesterol comes in there to</p>
<p>patch the hole in the artery with with</p>
<p>calcium as kind of a spackling thing and</p>
<p>so if there&rsquo;s damage damage in the wall</p>
<p>you can actually have that occur and</p>
<p>your body&rsquo;s just trying to heal it so</p>
<p>the LDL is not the criminal it&rsquo;s in the</p>
<p>crime scene but it&rsquo;s not it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>passing through to help you okay now</p>
<p>when you do a ketogenic diet you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>basically running your body on ketones</p>
<p>okay you&rsquo;re running your body on fat</p>
<p>fuel and triglycerides that&rsquo;s the blood</p>
<p>side that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s in the fat cell so</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to be coming out and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to be going into the body to use</p>
<p>it to be used as fuel the key thing</p>
<p>Karen is that if your triglycerides are</p>
<p>low this means that your body is using</p>
<p>them you&rsquo;re using them as fuel so it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>totally fine to have high LDL as long as</p>
<p>your cholesterol your triglycerides are</p>
<p>low which years are and your HDL is high</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s totally fine you just have to</p>
<p>really understand the mechanism probably</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s happening is you actually lost</p>
<p>all this weight and then now what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>happening is a lot of the excess</p>
<p>triglycerides that were in your fat cell</p>
<p>are mobilized as fuel and now your</p>
<p>cholesterol is high because your body&rsquo;s</p>
<p>finally dumping that from the fat cells</p>
<p>because that at some point it&rsquo;s to start</p>
<p>dumping the the reserve of cholesterol</p>
<p>so you really have nothing to worry</p>
<p>about is especially if your</p>
<p>triglycerides are low and your HDL is</p>
<p>high it&rsquo;s a normal thing</p>
<p>your body&rsquo;s trying to heal whatever the</p>
<p>key is to eat really healthy as far as a</p>
<p>lot of vegetables and the kale shake</p>
<p>just to kind of</p>
<p>make sure there&rsquo;s no more holes or</p>
<p>damage in the artery wall which</p>
<p>basically came from high levels of</p>
<p>insulin okay</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some great there&rsquo;s a video I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna release on this by Dave Feldman</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a great guy you can look him up</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s an engineer and he has some he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like the human pincushion he&rsquo;s doing</p>
<p>like live experiments and it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>amazing data okay so I hope I answered</p>
<p>that yeah thanks for the question</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s go - sure Esch from Toronto you</p>
<p>had a question go ahead cheers dr. Barry</p>
<p>how you doing good how are you</p>
<p>they stick to the point I don&rsquo;t waste</p>
<p>time I did eat oh we&rsquo;re about two years</p>
<p>ago for six months I mean worked well I</p>
<p>lost like 40 pounds it was so good and I</p>
<p>I got out of Quito and I started in the</p>
<p>normal way of living a game and I gained</p>
<p>so much weight like I&rsquo;m about 190 pounds</p>
<p>now I have to lose 30 pounds but six</p>
<p>months ago when it&rsquo;s taking up all the</p>
<p>sugars out of my body what&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m getting depressed just society but</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not suicidal and the doctor said he</p>
<p>needs some SS all right but I don&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>to get into toast so I got back on the</p>
<p>food again everything&rsquo;s normal</p>
<p>no more depression nothing that was my</p>
<p>first problem okay and the second</p>
<p>problem and the second problem is when I</p>
<p>take kale celery cucumber I mix it I</p>
<p>make it use of it I mean like smoothie</p>
<p>and I drink it yeah when I drink too too</p>
<p>much other your two glasses of it a</p>
<p>trinket and I get diarrhea in about half</p>
<p>hour so when I get diarrhea</p>
<p>I get dehydrated and I get my grid with</p>
<p>aura which I get blind almost okay okay</p>
<p>so these are actually let&rsquo;s take let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>take the first one first okay so when</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re depressed when you get on keto</p>
<p>all that means is that you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re a</p>
<p>little very low on B vitamins so there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>something going on with your gut that</p>
<p>could either probably not allowing you</p>
<p>to absorb them so</p>
<p>a good probiotic would help you</p>
<p>something like maybe called effective</p>
<p>microbes you can find it online it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>really good one but but start taking a</p>
<p>lot of nutritional yeast that should</p>
<p>help bring your mood back up the other</p>
<p>thing is which i think is complicating</p>
<p>things</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re eating certain vegetables that</p>
<p>your body obviously does not have the</p>
<p>enzymes for or you don&rsquo;t have the</p>
<p>microbes for yet so you&rsquo;re gonna have to</p>
<p>substitute your vegetables for a</p>
<p>completely different type of line of</p>
<p>vegetables maybe something like regular</p>
<p>greens like lettuce greens instead of</p>
<p>some kale and celery that you you have a</p>
<p>problem digesting just just switch it</p>
<p>over that&rsquo;s the simple way because when</p>
<p>you have diarrhea you&rsquo;re gonna basically</p>
<p>wipe out a lot of the fluids and acids</p>
<p>and that alone could throw off your</p>
<p>electrolytes big-time especially</p>
<p>potassium and so you now you actually</p>
<p>are aggravating the condition because</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to be dehydrated because</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re losing electrolytes and the</p>
<p>fluids and the acids and now you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>pull in the minerals so you have to</p>
<p>replenish that probably with some good</p>
<p>lactic acid things like kombucha tea</p>
<p>things like that so and add some more</p>
<p>fomented vegetables so take more B</p>
<p>vitamins okay number one and number two</p>
<p>switch your vegetables to things that</p>
<p>aren&rsquo;t going to cause diarrhea</p>
<p>alright good question alright Karen hey</p>
<p>okay so first I&rsquo;m going to say if</p>
<p>Facebook people can hear you may want to</p>
<p>go to YouTube there&rsquo;s a little technical</p>
<p>difficulty sorry about that</p>
<p>you never know in this world of media</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s bugs or not bugs so thanks</p>
<p>for hanging in and produced her</p>
<p>suggesting that we restart again dr.</p>
<p>Berg all right guys you know what just</p>
<p>hold on 30 seconds do it really fast</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s reboot this thing and try to get</p>
<p>this thing on everyone will show me but</p>
<p>unfortunately the stay-put</p>
<p>you</p>
<p>all right we&rsquo;re back Wow</p>
<p>all right Karen do you what did you want</p>
<p>to you want to give a shout out what do</p>
<p>you want me to all question cuz you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>right in the middle of giving a shout</p>
<p>out thanks for your patience guys yeah</p>
<p>well first of all shout out last I saw</p>
<p>it was Australia Romania all over the</p>
<p>United States British Columbia Texas New</p>
<p>Jersey Wisconsin dr. Berg you want to</p>
<p>shout it out to the home hopefully</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re from Kenosha the homeland yeah</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s dead she&rsquo;s head California Arizona</p>
<p>just all over the place I have question</p>
<p>though so Jimmy wants to know is too</p>
<p>much lettuce gonna kick you out of I</p>
<p>think this is a good question because we</p>
<p>run into people or either having some</p>
<p>diarrhea or constipation constipation or</p>
<p>they basically can bump him out of</p>
<p>ketosis but here here&rsquo;s the thing if</p>
<p>your metabolism is moderate to good you</p>
<p>can do large amounts of vegetables okay</p>
<p>but there is a point where like I</p>
<p>recommend a lot of vegetables like 10</p>
<p>cups right and there&rsquo;s very few people</p>
<p>that will do that sometimes I get seven</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a minor point because there the</p>
<p>amount of calories the amount of carbs</p>
<p>and vegetables is very very low however</p>
<p>with some people I will say it could</p>
<p>slow you down a little bit so but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>so rare and it&rsquo;s such a small fraction</p>
<p>of the population I would stick with the</p>
<p>vegetables first and then if you really</p>
<p>need to alter them go for it but there</p>
<p>are and I have a video on this you you</p>
<p>want you know if you have regular greens</p>
<p>like lettuce and stuff and celery it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just there&rsquo;s so few carbs in there that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very unlikely but you know some of</p>
<p>the other things like maybe like squash</p>
<p>and might be an issue</p>
<p>maybe cauliflower possibly for certain</p>
<p>people so you can try to maybe reduce</p>
<p>those and see if you actually lose more</p>
<p>weight if you do then ride with it cut</p>
<p>it</p>
<p>get down to your ideal weight and then</p>
<p>add it back in alright alright Karen do</p>
<p>you have you want to ask another</p>
<p>question go for it do you know about or</p>
<p>what are your thoughts on this snake</p>
<p>diet yeah there&rsquo;s a guy that uses a lot</p>
<p>of swear words diet like what are you</p>
<p>eating thing</p>
<p>no no no it&rsquo;s basically the snake dot</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s this guy who basically he&rsquo;s either</p>
<p>really yeah yeah that&rsquo;s her screaming at</p>
<p>him so that&rsquo;s his diet the snake died so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what that&rsquo;s all about</p>
<p>oh you do know no I&rsquo;m scared I collect</p>
<p>passed it one time because you sent me I</p>
<p>thought it was yeah I don&rsquo;t know what</p>
<p>what do you think about that I think I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t really watch his video so I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>really comment on that okay so do you</p>
<p>have any other comments</p>
<p>any other questions yeah we get this</p>
<p>sometimes somebody&rsquo;s asking what if</p>
<p>their adrenal and liver body type</p>
<p>remember the body types yep yeah so if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re a dream little number here&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>thing about that guys you want to get</p>
<p>the basic protocol in there like Health</p>
<p>Aikido and enema fasting don&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>worry about the body types and then once</p>
<p>you get going then you can tweak it it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>right in the book right this book right</p>
<p>here which all of you have and then I go</p>
<p>into specifically what body type you</p>
<p>should do but some people are a mixed</p>
<p>body body type and the problem if your</p>
<p>adrenal and liver for example question</p>
<p>is what do you do you focus more on the</p>
<p>liver adrenal well in here I talked</p>
<p>about it</p>
<p>but if you have a choice you want to go</p>
<p>for the adrenal purse because that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>usually more of a priority than the</p>
<p>liver but even if you mess up and focus</p>
<p>on the liver you&rsquo;re still going to get</p>
<p>improvement because everything is</p>
<p>connected the hip bones connected to the</p>
<p>thigh bone but typically the adrenal one</p>
<p>is the real big one as far as a priority</p>
<p>because of stress can dominate</p>
<p>everything else because it produces</p>
<p>cortisol yeah so so let&rsquo;s go right to</p>
<p>Rachael from California I think you had</p>
<p>a question that we may have just</p>
<p>go ahead Rachel I yes I ended up in the</p>
<p>urgent care I called you last week</p>
<p>because the diarrhea just wouldn&rsquo;t stop</p>
<p>it was all liquid yeah and I notice that</p>
<p>I ate bacon and in cheese bill she&rsquo;s I</p>
<p>would get diarrhea right away as soon as</p>
<p>I ate that food and so I don&rsquo;t know if I</p>
<p>have to stop it and or what could I do</p>
<p>for that so I have a question you you um</p>
<p>you were eating a certain way and then</p>
<p>all of a sudden something you ate</p>
<p>triggered the diarrhea is that right</p>
<p>well no I said it started with eating</p>
<p>the salads</p>
<p>I had salad and then after that we all</p>
<p>started I was still doing the keel and</p>
<p>and and it just keeps getting worse I</p>
<p>this is what I think that hey Pat</p>
<p>happened Rachel I think there was some</p>
<p>type of microbe in that salad you see</p>
<p>this all the time where you know they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing recalls on spinach and salad</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s there are microbes that live in</p>
<p>the soil and you can get these like</p>
<p>e.coli and then comb you get diarrhea</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the number one symptom and it can</p>
<p>last for a long time it can throws off</p>
<p>the whole system because typically most</p>
<p>people don&rsquo;t have a problem cells unless</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some other raw other issue now</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;ve never ate salad before in your</p>
<p>life then that&rsquo;s a whole different scene</p>
<p>but chances are I think there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>microbe so I would probably get a</p>
<p>evaluation on the ER</p>
<p>maybe a stool sample to see if there is</p>
<p>a microbe in there that&rsquo;s disrupting</p>
<p>everything and then you&rsquo;re gonna have to</p>
<p>consume things like some keeper</p>
<p>blackberries but not a lot of other</p>
<p>foods maybe some some type of fiber to</p>
<p>kind of slow the process down right now</p>
<p>even psyllium seed until things can get</p>
<p>under control check with your doctor on</p>
<p>that because we have to settle it down</p>
<p>before you start eating because you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t you wiped out your your flora and</p>
<p>so you definitely need to start taking</p>
<p>probiotics</p>
<p>big time right now to put that back when</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done colonics and Kol Emma&rsquo;s and</p>
<p>different cleansing things</p>
<p>you know after period of time I can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>just go back to regular eating I have to</p>
<p>slowly build up I&rsquo;ll do soup I&rsquo;ll do</p>
<p>fermented foods for a day and then I&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>gradually start adding bigger foods</p>
<p>because you don&rsquo;t have the microbes to</p>
<p>digest bacon right now so go ahead and</p>
<p>do that Rachel all right good</p>
<p>so I need to go to Ruth she&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>waiting she&rsquo;s in Texas</p>
<p>go ahead Ruth good morning dr. Byrd can</p>
<p>you hear me yeah wonderful</p>
<p>I have last year I&rsquo;ve gone from a size</p>
<p>16 18 to size 8 already</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s our party Bell that&rsquo;s our</p>
<p>celebration Bell I was surprised</p>
<p>lethargic had gall stones diabetes all</p>
<p>the normal stuff that the American diet</p>
<p>does for us right but I am finally to a</p>
<p>point now I mean I worked on healing my</p>
<p>stomach first with the colostrum with</p>
<p>the l-glutamine doing the probiotics and</p>
<p>using the fermented vegetables and now I</p>
<p>have all this energy that I want to go</p>
<p>swimming and biking and hiking and do</p>
<p>yoga but my adrenals wake me up at 3:00</p>
<p>in the morning now when I first started</p>
<p>I took the adrenal support and it took</p>
<p>me down too much it made me very tired</p>
<p>so I switched to the renal fatigue added</p>
<p>the l-tryptophan the pantothenic acid</p>
<p>and finally got back up so I&rsquo;m kind of</p>
<p>fearful to go back into the adrenal and</p>
<p>cortisol relief but I&rsquo;d like something</p>
<p>that I can do to keep from that 3:00</p>
<p>a.m. wake-up call I mean should I just</p>
<p>wake up and do some work and go back to</p>
<p>bed or take a nap later in the day</p>
<p>should I try the adrenal fatigue or the</p>
<p>quarter</p>
<p>all relieved yeah good question what you</p>
<p>should do is take the adrenal the Corso</p>
<p>relief about three o&rsquo;clock in the</p>
<p>morning when you&rsquo;re waking up because it</p>
<p>makes you tired right okay well like you</p>
<p>take the sleep aid before I go to bed</p>
<p>yeah that you you should probably take</p>
<p>all of your adrenal stuff right before</p>
<p>you go to bed because you&rsquo;re right when</p>
<p>you wake up at 3:00 that&rsquo;s there too</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s right where the adrenals that</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s usually about imbalance with</p>
<p>the adrenals so you&rsquo;re kind of revved up</p>
<p>the other thing is have you done the</p>
<p>acupressure yet on your your body yes</p>
<p>every night I have the tool and I like I</p>
<p>said most all your products I&rsquo;ve pretty</p>
<p>much bought them from the beginning and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using em it&rsquo;s just kind of</p>
<p>tweaking them as to when to use them you</p>
<p>know and and how much to use like the</p>
<p>digest day the gallbladder formula are</p>
<p>fabulous I love those the minerals the</p>
<p>only thing that I&rsquo;m not able to do is</p>
<p>any of the powder drinks because of the</p>
<p>stevia for some reason all the natural</p>
<p>sugars are not the natural substitute</p>
<p>sugars cause me you know stomach pain</p>
<p>right under my rib cage</p>
<p>but everything else I&rsquo;ve been able to</p>
<p>use and like I said I have the adrenal</p>
<p>fatigue and I was taking it and I had to</p>
<p>stop taking it because my blood Sugar&rsquo;s</p>
<p>were going up too high and I think it</p>
<p>had to do with over stimulating my</p>
<p>adrenal somehow when I stopped taking it</p>
<p>the blood sugar went back down yeah so</p>
<p>when we get this thing that&rsquo;s kind of it</p>
<p>should be better by now you&rsquo;re doing all</p>
<p>the right things all these other</p>
<p>indicators are better then what I like</p>
<p>to do at this point is pull the string</p>
<p>get a little more data I would do a</p>
<p>cortisol test there&rsquo;s a great one that</p>
<p>is a hair analysis of course all hair</p>
<p>analysis is from Canada</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t I&rsquo;ve done a video on it I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have it offhand but you can search it</p>
<p>and you could find out it&rsquo;s kind</p>
<p>that gives you an average of your</p>
<p>cortisol level you could do a saliva</p>
<p>test but make sure every four hours but</p>
<p>we need more data to see what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>happening inside of your body is like</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s happening with cortisol is it is</p>
<p>it or is it the like adrenaline for</p>
<p>example adrenaline could be another</p>
<p>factor what happens to with blood sugars</p>
<p>especially at night if your have insulin</p>
<p>resistance and the insulin was high it</p>
<p>can push the blood sugar down and then</p>
<p>the adrenal can be kicked in there in</p>
<p>the middle of the night when the blood</p>
<p>sugars are too low to compensate so I</p>
<p>think what I would do is I would do that</p>
<p>and then continue to tweak things that</p>
<p>take the supplements before you go to</p>
<p>bed and then also go for very very long</p>
<p>walks like maybe in like an hour and a</p>
<p>half in the evening okay thanks Ruth all</p>
<p>right Karen over to you okay good quick</p>
<p>question if somebody has the old book do</p>
<p>they need the new one yeah you you need</p>
<p>this book here because the old book the</p>
<p>seven principles is outdated with</p>
<p>outdated information this is all the new</p>
<p>data that is if there&rsquo;s a lot of new</p>
<p>data over a thousand hours of work and</p>
<p>giving you the new information which is</p>
<p>a lot better than the old information</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m constantly changing and improving</p>
<p>things as we find things that work so</p>
<p>yeah you need to get the new book okay</p>
<p>good and then the next question can you</p>
<p>talk a little bit about cheese for</p>
<p>somebody who&rsquo;s a diabetic how to handle</p>
<p>that on the keto diet well I think</p>
<p>cheese is good just make sure you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>get the low fat you want to get the</p>
<p>fattiest cheese you could find because</p>
<p>the higher fat is the least amount of</p>
<p>stimulus to insulin and we&rsquo;re trying to</p>
<p>actually decrease the need for insulin</p>
<p>by eating certain foods and there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>thing called an insulin scale Karen that</p>
<p>you glad you brought up it&rsquo;s right here</p>
<p>the I&rsquo;m sorry the insulin index which is</p>
<p>a scale of insulin of all the foods that</p>
<p>trigger insulin you&rsquo;ve heard of the</p>
<p>glycemic index right Karen oh yeah those</p>
<p>are foods that increase blood sugar but</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t you want to know what foods</p>
<p>increase insulin yes I would okay good</p>
<p>so you can download it there&rsquo;s a link</p>
<p>down below</p>
<p>and it has some information about cheese</p>
<p>as well but yep that&rsquo;s right okay what</p>
<p>tell me over to me now okay so one more</p>
<p>at one point about your vegetables some</p>
<p>people when they get salad and things</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t always clean it sometimes</p>
<p>like they&rsquo;ll buy from the farmers market</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t clean it sometimes it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>triple washed well that&rsquo;s fine but you</p>
<p>might want to get in habit of just</p>
<p>cleaning your vegetables because you</p>
<p>never know what&rsquo;s in there</p>
<p>I mean sometimes I&rsquo;ll like cut up on the</p>
<p>vegetables I like see oh wow there&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>sorts of things going on there so clean</p>
<p>those just to make sure there&rsquo;s no yes</p>
<p>like microbes like little worms and okay</p>
<p>fun stuff like that can okay I was</p>
<p>finding money here no no just pair of</p>
<p>old short microbes oh my friends Karen</p>
<p>alright so Thomas has been waiting from</p>
<p>New York</p>
<p>go ahead Thomas you had a question about</p>
<p>trace minerals good morning dr. Johnny</p>
<p>good I like taking walking to the first</p>
<p>lady of Quito as well up a big fan hi</p>
<p>dr. Berg your electrolytes powder in</p>
<p>your trace minerals could you explain</p>
<p>the difference please yeah big</p>
<p>difference the trace minerals are</p>
<p>minerals needed in very small amounts</p>
<p>like selenium like iodine cobalt even</p>
<p>iron then you have regular minerals like</p>
<p>electrolytes that are needed in larger</p>
<p>amounts potassium calcium magnesium</p>
<p>sodium those are the bigger minerals and</p>
<p>so the electrolyte powder has the bigger</p>
<p>minerals that you don&rsquo;t need a lot of</p>
<p>amounts but you know what&rsquo;s within the</p>
<p>electrolytes is I put the trace minerals</p>
<p>in there so it kind of killed two birds</p>
<p>with one stone but the trace minerals do</p>
<p>not have the other minerals in any</p>
<p>significant significant amounts and</p>
<p>trace minerals help proteins in the body</p>
<p>so you would want to take the trace</p>
<p>minerals if you wanted to strengthen</p>
<p>your nails your hair your collagen so it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t necessarily boost energy but it</p>
<p>actually helps body proteins good</p>
<p>question Thomas</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll have to do a video on that one</p>
<p>alright can hey what do you think about</p>
<p>water pills like diuretics yeah yeah so</p>
<p>again I&rsquo;m not gonna answer medical</p>
<p>questions but the thing is I always have</p>
<p>to ask a question why are you holding</p>
<p>fluid in the first place why is the body</p>
<p>holding fluid usually because you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>consuming enough potassium so if you</p>
<p>consume 7 to 10 cups of vegetables</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna find your fluid you</p>
<p>probably won&rsquo;t hold fluid very much so</p>
<p>the need for diuretics might not be</p>
<p>there but check with your doctor I&rsquo;d</p>
<p>like that Karen did you like that answer</p>
<p>I liked it a lot ok good yeah so Rachel</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re from Ohio you had a question you</p>
<p>broke your leg oh sorry about that</p>
<p>last year and i had tried doing keto</p>
<p>before a long time ago but i I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know why I keep coming back when Weight</p>
<p>Watchers and I&rsquo;m dealing with Weight</p>
<p>Watchers</p>
<p>so and my leg isn&rsquo;t healing and I am</p>
<p>more really obese right now I lost them</p>
<p>100 pounds the accidental Weight</p>
<p>Watchers but it&rsquo;s I&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>yo-yo and I&rsquo;m 38 probably what like my</p>
<p>leg was at the right or left leg that</p>
<p>you broke it was my left distal femur</p>
<p>Wow you broke yeah</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not healing and they&rsquo;re swimming I</p>
<p>need a bone graft or something ok and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m I just feel like I can do something</p>
<p>with food maybe to help it or</p>
<p>nutritional I don&rsquo;t know healed a boner</p>
<p>yes can I give you my two cents on that</p>
<p>sure ok so first of all you need to do</p>
<p>get some vitamin k2 k2 that&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;ll help the calcium in the bone</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s number one number two the Kido /</p>
<p>instrument fasting common</p>
<p>done healthily based on this book right</p>
<p>here okay will greatly help in the</p>
<p>healing a recovery process I&rsquo;m gonna</p>
<p>tell you why because you&rsquo;re gonna help</p>
<p>regulate and support insulin levels and</p>
<p>when you support insulin levels the body</p>
<p>can then start absorbing more nutrients</p>
<p>calcium and the fat side with vitamins</p>
<p>and protein which the bone needs to help</p>
<p>heal so that&rsquo;s why like a diabetic that</p>
<p>has blood sugar problems they don&rsquo;t heal</p>
<p>as well as people that don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>diabetes so I think this is your answer</p>
<p>to speed things up now the problem with</p>
<p>Weight Watchers is that you&rsquo;re hungry</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re up roller coastering and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re craving when you do &lsquo;quite other</p>
<p>than fasting your cravings go right down</p>
<p>your hunger goes down and the longer you</p>
<p>do intermittent fasting you your body</p>
<p>goes into a self-cleaning mode it starts</p>
<p>to heal a lot faster and repair and</p>
<p>inflammation goes down so bite the</p>
<p>bullet do it jump right in Rachel and I</p>
<p>think you&rsquo;re gonna be happy you did that</p>
<p>alright good over to Karen hey okay so</p>
<p>someone asked if fish oil breaks a fast</p>
<p>yeah the fish oil so just are not going</p>
<p>to be enough oil to break a fast so</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna be totally fine doing fish</p>
<p>oils it&rsquo;s just very small amounts of oil</p>
<p>so I wouldn&rsquo;t worry about it</p>
<p>okay now what if apple cider vinegar is</p>
<p>too acid for someone they have some kind</p>
<p>of condition where they&rsquo;re sensitive to</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s following it or something like that</p>
<p>well there&rsquo;s certain people that just</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t do it because either they have an</p>
<p>ulcer or they have gastritis</p>
<p>inflammation in the gut and so in which</p>
<p>case you don&rsquo;t want to even consume it</p>
<p>now you could get into pill form</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something called digest formula</p>
<p>I have it has it in powder form that</p>
<p>might be better but if you react to it</p>
<p>then your system is sensitive and you</p>
<p>might need to do more of the wheatgrass</p>
<p>juice powder for a while to help heal</p>
<p>the system and then go back to it but</p>
<p>you know people that have inflammation</p>
<p>in the stomach or an ulcer that that</p>
<p>takes a long time to heal Karen</p>
<p>it could take probably you know four to</p>
<p>six months of healthy eating so yeah so</p>
<p>you just give it time okay I have</p>
<p>another interesting question here yeah</p>
<p>go ahead just what give me the</p>
<p>interesting ones I want some interesting</p>
<p>not the same question the interesting</p>
<p>yeah give me this interesting I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think we&rsquo;ve ever had this question</p>
<p>before does pipe smoking pipe tobacco</p>
<p>affect results on keto well the thing</p>
<p>about pipe tobacco or even cigarettes</p>
<p>there you&rsquo;re basically you&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>deplete the adrenal factors and also a</p>
<p>lot about them and see and it creates a</p>
<p>lot of oxidation in the tissue so your</p>
<p>body&rsquo;s not its breakdown and destruction</p>
<p>of the tissues of the arteries and the</p>
<p>eyes and it&rsquo;s kind of corrodes and</p>
<p>oxidizes like rusting out the inside of</p>
<p>the body so you literally if you&rsquo;re you</p>
<p>know doing that you&rsquo;re gonna have to</p>
<p>counter that with eating really really</p>
<p>healthy foods the foods a lot of vitamin</p>
<p>C B vitamins to counter the damage</p>
<p>because it adds another layer that of</p>
<p>destruction to the body so so we need to</p>
<p>say a lot are you talking about really</p>
<p>doing keto way everybody else is doing</p>
<p>keto or do you know doing you know and</p>
<p>then additional supplements on top of</p>
<p>that you might want to do additional</p>
<p>supplements on top of that a lot of</p>
<p>phytonutrients like the lady was doing</p>
<p>the kale shakes right you should be like</p>
<p>I would start you know if I was addicted</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry I mean craving tobacco I would</p>
<p>be down in Cal shakes each day I was</p>
<p>doing supplements to counter that</p>
<p>because it is a factory or just depletes</p>
<p>you of nutrients fair enough fair enough</p>
<p>good turn okay over to you all right</p>
<p>good let&rsquo;s go to Christy from North</p>
<p>Carolina you had a question about high</p>
<p>levels of glucose a few weeks ago about</p>
<p>keto and high glucose that was a big</p>
<p>relief to me a few mom mid-may I started</p>
<p>stalling with weight and my blood sugar</p>
<p>it had been and I&rsquo;ve been doing kiddo</p>
<p>since March when I started doing that my</p>
<p>blood Sugar&rsquo;s have gotten down</p>
<p>to like the 8090 range and I didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>measure before Tito so I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>where they were then I do have a history</p>
<p>of family diabetics as well but um about</p>
<p>six weeks ago my weight loss stalled and</p>
<p>my blood sugar shot up to one 138 now</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s staying around like 110 or whatever</p>
<p>so I assume it&rsquo;s my insulin healing but</p>
<p>will this cause weight loss stall and</p>
<p>you said it could take a long time how</p>
<p>long is a long time I know it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>different for everybody but let me ask</p>
<p>you this Christy</p>
<p>do you have other positive indicators</p>
<p>like other positive benefits even though</p>
<p>your Sugar&rsquo;s hide you have other</p>
<p>improvements in your body um I&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>kind of even my my waist measurements</p>
<p>and just kind of sticking around the</p>
<p>same right now okay</p>
<p>do you crave sweets I do okay are you</p>
<p>doing heat oh and I don&rsquo;t have time to</p>
<p>go into the exact thing but do you feel</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;re doing it correctly are you</p>
<p>doing it partially I think I&rsquo;m doing it</p>
<p>well for a little while I was doing</p>
<p>water tip here and I just cut that out</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s fermented with sugar and I</p>
<p>thought maybe that was messing me up but</p>
<p>for the last few weeks have been pretty</p>
<p>strict again and are you doing in a</p>
<p>minute fasting yeah okay are you how</p>
<p>many times wind your first meal usually</p>
<p>around I usually do about 18 to 22 hours</p>
<p>fasted Wow and eating around one o&rsquo;clock</p>
<p>okay alright so are you doing any type</p>
<p>of B vitamins nutritional yeast and</p>
<p>electrolytes when I remembered that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>bad habit that I have forgetting okay</p>
<p>well just a couple tips here Chris</p>
<p>Christie I think you&rsquo;re on the right</p>
<p>track I think the fact that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>craving tells us there&rsquo;s something that</p>
<p>we need to improve the biggest thing I</p>
<p>look at is are you doing it correct are</p>
<p>you sure you&rsquo;re doing it based on what I</p>
<p>talked about you know I doing a lot of</p>
<p>greens and you not make sure you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>doing enough protein are you doing</p>
<p>enough fat so I like to in a minute</p>
<p>fascinating but there&rsquo;s always these</p>
<p>hidden things like the water kefir that</p>
<p>might be an issue</p>
<p>that being said what happens when you do</p>
<p>this your insulin starts coming down</p>
<p>because the need for insulin is not</p>
<p>there because there&rsquo;s not a lot of</p>
<p>carbohydrates in the diet to do with so</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t need the amount of insulin</p>
<p>that you would when you&rsquo;re eating high</p>
<p>glucose and sugar so what happens is</p>
<p>that because the insulin is not there</p>
<p>which is a push down wave your sugars do</p>
<p>rebound a little bit higher but your</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not out of control I mean they&rsquo;re a</p>
<p>little higher but it&rsquo;s not terrible so I</p>
<p>think you&rsquo;re in you&rsquo;re in the process of</p>
<p>healing</p>
<p>I would tweak it with the nutrition</p>
<p>consistently I have a lot of other</p>
<p>things in the videos of what you can do</p>
<p>with exercise get over my sleep decrease</p>
<p>stress add some other supplements in</p>
<p>there and then that&rsquo;s gonna speed things</p>
<p>up a lot maybe another you know three or</p>
<p>four weeks and you should see some</p>
<p>really good change the other thing is</p>
<p>keep a log of what you eat so you can</p>
<p>look at it and evaluate it in a new unit</p>
<p>time so you can kind of like step</p>
<p>outside yourself and go oh that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m eating I didn&rsquo;t realize that you</p>
<p>know that&rsquo;s also important so stay tuned</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll be more videos on that as well</p>
<p>Christine so thanks for calling dr. Berg</p>
<p>yes we have a special watcher oh yes</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s watching oh hey mom how you doing</p>
<p>give you a shout-out every everybody on</p>
<p>Facebook is saying hello to March oh</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s great that&rsquo;s awesome</p>
<p>now I&rsquo;m gonna segue okay good segue okay</p>
<p>so someone&rsquo;s getting cystic acne or</p>
<p>describing their situation as cystic</p>
<p>acne newly on intermittent fasting</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s happening well there&rsquo;s two</p>
<p>reasons for that typically it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>insulin is high and your skin should get</p>
<p>better within a minute fasting but if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going through a toffee G which is</p>
<p>the recycling of old proteins and</p>
<p>clearing out of microbes it could be a</p>
<p>little bit of a detox reaction the other</p>
<p>thing it could do Karen is affect your</p>
<p>ovaries and that could actually then</p>
<p>throw up the hormones and give you a</p>
<p>little acne so what I would recommend is</p>
<p>probably support the ovaries with more</p>
<p>iodine see calc would be the best thing</p>
<p>in fat soluble vitamins make sure your</p>
<p>diet is really good to support the ovary</p>
<p>because the ovary needs supporting good</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>hey I wanted to say something that I I</p>
<p>forgot to say for several weeks now is</p>
<p>that this year doing keto purely well</p>
<p>not as much as dr. Berg right</p>
<p>but really doing keto I had almost no</p>
<p>seasonal allergies Wow awesome thing for</p>
<p>me</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s good time that&rsquo;s awesome yeah so</p>
<p>if you guys or you have kids that are</p>
<p>having trouble with allergies I really</p>
<p>recommend it and we did get a couple of</p>
<p>questions on teens and little guys doing</p>
<p>keto how many vegetables you know how</p>
<p>many cups of vegetables would you</p>
<p>recommend and how to adapt it for a</p>
<p>little guy you want to talk about that</p>
<p>right there with the kid I&rsquo;m gonna</p>
<p>actually do a whole program for kids and</p>
<p>even a seminar but you start out finding</p>
<p>something that they like some vegetable</p>
<p>and you start giving it more of that is</p>
<p>but here&rsquo;s the thing when you actually</p>
<p>get a child in to get them replace the</p>
<p>junk and don&rsquo;t even tell them that</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no sugar in it you know start</p>
<p>making these keto bombs and little</p>
<p>cookies and low sugar and then what</p>
<p>happens when their blood sugars are</p>
<p>better they&rsquo;re naturally gonna go for</p>
<p>more on vegetables if you have a child</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s way out of balance and eating</p>
<p>junk they&rsquo;re only gonna crave one thing</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s the chicken wing no the</p>
<p>chicken tenders that&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>consume they&rsquo;ll like a chicken tenders</p>
<p>so like in the jello tenders</p>
<p>yeah and jello that was you all right</p>
<p>Marge green jello Doritos and chicken</p>
<p>tenders yeah so once you get your body</p>
<p>in balance you&rsquo;ll want healthier foods</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just how it works yeah and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>interesting because when you when people</p>
<p>leave a lot more junk food they even</p>
<p>though they&rsquo;re eating a lot more</p>
<p>equality junk food they&rsquo;re still hungry</p>
<p>after that because of the issue so you</p>
<p>have a kid doing that it&rsquo;s this out of</p>
<p>control and I want it just on that note</p>
<p>Karen yeah we are seriously thinking</p>
<p>about probably definitely going to be</p>
<p>doing a keto summit in the fall</p>
<p>we want you to come out you know</p>
<p>something we want you to come out</p>
<p>because number one it&rsquo;s gonna be an</p>
<p>awesome two-day event maybe a one day</p>
<p>maybe two we&rsquo;ll see</p>
<p>DC&rsquo;s awesome never well that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>second thing I was gonna tell him yes</p>
<p>just yeah okay go ahead in the fall if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve never been here you have to check</p>
<p>out this area it&rsquo;s gorgeous they have</p>
<p>things to see history old town you also</p>
<p>have these vineyards which you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>probably going to drink it but you can</p>
<p>go check them out</p>
<p>I mean there&rsquo;s a lot of things to do</p>
<p>there are tons that I mean it&rsquo;s not and</p>
<p>of course if you&rsquo;re living here you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t beautiful</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t don&rsquo;t go out and see these things</p>
<p>but if you&rsquo;re coming in from the outside</p>
<p>you got to check it out that way you</p>
<p>come to the convention this some yeah</p>
<p>the Kolar summit a summit and then spend</p>
<p>a couple days to go go to old town check</p>
<p>out the different tours they have yeah</p>
<p>we could probably even arrange buses or</p>
<p>something right I think they can arrange</p>
<p>that and that&rsquo;d be fun no we could</p>
<p>arrange like a big what do you called</p>

<p>but just we&rsquo;ll stay tuned we&rsquo;ll have a</p>
<p>promo on that soon okay we&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>figure it out let&rsquo;s see this Karen&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like promising only thing you get be</p>
<p>like no we&rsquo;re not going to do the jackal</p>
<p>bus okay so we have Constantine from</p>
<p>Kentucky it&rsquo;s constant constant okay hi</p>
<p>how you doing good how are you okay I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>doing pretty good</p>
<p>but I have a couple of questions okay I</p>
<p>do in a minute fasting and keto and I</p>
<p>only eat once a day and I&rsquo;m 254 pounds I</p>
<p>have lost I want to say 10 pounds</p>
<p>already but I want to know exactly how</p>
<p>many cards and protein and calories I</p>
<p>need to consume a day if I only eat once</p>
<p>a day and and also whatever is pickles</p>
<p>okay to eat you know so why are you in</p>
<p>why are you on the keto diet and like</p>
<p>the exercise wise I want to do more than</p>
<p>just walking but is it safe to do more</p>
<p>than just walking like can I do</p>
<p>exercise like I got a gym membership and</p>
<p>I want to know if I can you know go to</p>
<p>the gym and really do like some cardio</p>
<p>to help with the weight loss in the end</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t take any vitamins but prenatal</p>
<p>pills so I want to know do I need to</p>
<p>take more you know fan of other you know</p>
<p>and then also I&rsquo;m trying to get it all</p>
<p>in I&rsquo;m sorry I have I brought online</p>
<p>this neo filled super powder collagen</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s good or not but</p>
<p>I want to know is that&rsquo;s healthy and in</p>
<p>the heavens tummy</p>
<p>fiber because they say they helps with</p>
<p>the constipation and then like the</p>
<p>biofield</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like a you know one question this</p>
<p>could be another 20 minutes I think that</p>
<p>was all in one breath wasn&rsquo;t it that was</p>
<p>good yeah okay so let me just kind of go</p>
<p>through this because you&rsquo;ve exceeded the</p>
<p>number one question okay so yeah to get</p>
<p>into all the calories I&rsquo;m gonna you can</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s the thing there&rsquo;s videos on that</p>
<p>you can all these you can find the video</p>
<p>on the different calories I mean at your</p>
<p>size maybe you do fifteen fifteen</p>
<p>hundred calories if you&rsquo;re doing one</p>
<p>meal it&rsquo;s gonna be hard but I would try</p>
<p>to do maybe between 13 to 1,500 calories</p>
<p>from that one meal I like the fact that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing one meal so hours the carbs</p>
<p>try to push them down as low as you can</p>
<p>I mean if you can get them down to 15</p>
<p>maybe even 10 it might be hard if you</p>
<p>could what would happen you would lose</p>
<p>more weight pickles are totally fine</p>
<p>just make sure it doesn&rsquo;t have sugar</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t do the prenatals if they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>synthetic do a food base prenatal okay</p>
<p>and then you ask another question that I</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t even oh exercise yeah yeah you can</p>
<p>totally add the exercise in there just</p>
<p>beat things up other than walking I have</p>
<p>videos on that so I&rsquo;m not gonna actually</p>
<p>repeat that watch the videos and then</p>
<p>collagen is fine you can do that you can</p>
<p>add that to the mix make sure you have</p>
<p>it with the meal and then the last</p>
<p>question I can&rsquo;t read my handwriting</p>
<p>Oh fiber get your fiber from your</p>
<p>vegetables okay all your your seven cups</p>
<p>of vegetables all right</p>
<p>you exceeded for the next three weeks of</p>
<p>answers so hey iris that&rsquo;s all for you a</p>
<p>woman who can get twenty questions about</p>
<p>one breath she is on my list I like her</p>
<p>but I have a question Trisha is is</p>
<p>asking why would she be so jumpy like if</p>
<p>somebody comes in a room and she&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>expecting it or walks up behind her</p>
<p>totally jumpy hi nurse I mean like this</p>
<p>like okay yeah so that that&rsquo;s um usually</p>
<p>a dominating sympathetic nervous system</p>
<p>Karen okay okay that&rsquo;s an adrenal thing</p>
<p>so you want to support the adrenals and</p>
<p>the biggest thing that I would recommend</p>
<p>is nutritional yeast a lot of it cuz</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the b1 to help the adrenals chill</p>
<p>out and then do the adrenal acupressure</p>
<p>tool thing right here that&rsquo;ll you can do</p>
<p>that every night before you go to bed it</p>
<p>kind of starts calming the adrenals to</p>
<p>get more sleep but it&rsquo;s an overactive</p>
<p>adrenal issue yeah mm-hmm good okay now</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna go to Karen from Arkansas oh</p>
<p>go ahead Karen hello thank you doctor</p>
<p>for taking my call and I kind of need to</p>
<p>give you just a little history of myself</p>
<p>and then I want to let you kind of guide</p>
<p>me and where I need to start with your</p>
<p>program I started out can you connect as</p>
<p>it in 20 seconds oh all we could do is</p>
<p>answer questions and I&rsquo;ve had a partial</p>
<p>line removal and then I&rsquo;m just now had</p>
<p>my gallbladder removed about a couple</p>
<p>weeks ago it was full of gallstones and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just kind of left as to where do I</p>
<p>start because I used to go like every</p>
<p>week to the hospital to get fluids</p>
<p>because my sodium was getting down to</p>
<p>120 s 125 that kind of range and it</p>
<p>would just i&rsquo;m just eat salt to try to</p>
<p>keep it up and my endocrinologist has me</p>
<p>on</p>
<p>cortex in Florida the Florida Neff</p>
<p>I take in the morning and at night Oh</p>
<p>point one and then the cortex he kinda</p>
<p>let me guide myself as to how I&rsquo;m doing</p>
<p>but when I first started all this and I</p>
<p>still don&rsquo;t have any appetite okay so</p>
<p>now let me see some let me give you some</p>
<p>general chips simply because I can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>actually tell you how to treat a disease</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m gonna give you some food tips</p>
<p>and nutrition tips to support what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on okay because Addison&rsquo;s is a low</p>
<p>adrenal it&rsquo;s the adrenals are not</p>
<p>putting out their hormones so it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>different than Cushing&rsquo;s which is</p>
<p>pumping out too much so that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>happening it&rsquo;s usually autoimmune so</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an immune problem I think to</p>
<p>support a healthy adrenal function my</p>
<p>adrenal fatigue formula might really</p>
<p>help you to support that in addition the</p>
<p>gall bladder formula because you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have a gall bladder to support what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>missing those two things I think would</p>
<p>be good and yes a lot of sea salt are</p>
<p>going to be good working on the adrenal</p>
<p>because the thing about the Addison&rsquo;s is</p>
<p>like you need these you need these</p>
<p>adrenal judo support so and you&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>need a lot more salt cuz it&rsquo;s kind of</p>
<p>going right through you so I would take</p>
<p>something called adrenal fatigue formula</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s for like someone that is really</p>
<p>fatigued adrenals and then sea salt and</p>
<p>also do keto in an ANA fasting hardcore</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s going to help your immune</p>
<p>system over time to support that because</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s behind Addison&rsquo;s okay</p>
<p>thanks Karen I&rsquo;m sorry I had to go short</p>
<p>with you there</p>
<p>alright so Karen do we have a question</p>
<p>there are so many questions we&rsquo;re really</p>
<p>having a good time on social media today</p>
<p>and liz is watching hi Liz hey Liz Liz</p>
<p>Liz used to list the one that worked</p>
<p>well for us for Liz clap oh hey Liz yeah</p>
<p>awesome liz is doing great</p>
<p>yes bloggers are doing better yes okay</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>[Music]</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s one our oats useful yes for</p>
<p>cattle and different farm animals I felt</p>
<p>yeah so you had you have the oat which</p>
<p>is like you can make Quakers oat instant</p>
<p>cereal which comes with a lot of sugar</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s whole grain but they add a lot of</p>
<p>sugar in there</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just don&rsquo;t get me started on that I</p>
<p>know but here&rsquo;s the thing the the oats</p>
<p>are grains and we don&rsquo;t on the keto we</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t want to do grains because they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna they&rsquo;re high on the glycemic index</p>
<p>same with buckwheat by the way somebody</p>
<p>asked about book we same thing you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>want to do all the grains unless it says</p>
<p>heart healthy whole grains on the box of</p>
<p>Lucky Charms Lucky Charms it&rsquo;s healthy</p>
<p>right</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s my sarcasm everyone okay so okay</p>
<p>so this comes up all the time trying not</p>
<p>to take repeat questions but I think</p>
<p>this pushes one of your buttons here</p>
<p>what happens when you have high insulin</p>
<p>but low blood sugar</p>
<p>well you&rsquo;re pushing my buttons now show</p>
<p>your button well that&rsquo;s what happens is</p>
<p>high insulin is going to push your blood</p>
<p>sugars down you&rsquo;re gonna end up with low</p>
<p>blood sugars especially if there&rsquo;s not a</p>
<p>lot adrenal function there because the</p>
<p>adrenals aren&rsquo;t helping you so that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>usually a weak adrenal but it&rsquo;s a very</p>
<p>simple solution follow this book these</p>
<p>two books and problem solved doctor</p>
<p>burgers are any book you recommend to</p>
<p>help no I don&rsquo;t have any book that to</p>
<p>recommend but what happens I have a list</p>
<p>of all the things that you can do to</p>
<p>help support healthy insulin levels and</p>
<p>I mean it really does work and high</p>
<p>insulin is the number one problem out</p>
<p>there that&rsquo;s behind a lot of problems</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s all I&rsquo;m gonna say Karen right</p>
<p>but I do want to go only for educational</p>
<p>purpose it&rsquo;s not to meant to diagnose</p>
<p>anyone or cure anyone don&rsquo;t tell anyone</p>
<p>right if you get cured don&rsquo;t mention my</p>
<p>name right okay Vincent from the UK you</p>
<p>had a question yes my question was ah</p>
<p>haha</p>
<p>this really fast</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s becoming crazy and drizzle and</p>
<p>pimple there I&rsquo;m curious if there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>anything I can do within my diet that to</p>
<p>reducing the size or hopefully remove it</p>
<p>completely</p>
<p>the only other options have been offered</p>
<p>are subject to options and I would</p>
<p>rather not go though</p>
<p>got it here&rsquo;s just some ideas that you</p>
<p>can research ok that&rsquo;s my way of around</p>
<p>about telling you what to do but here&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the thing that I would research there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>something called ip6 it&rsquo;s an inositol</p>
<p>product ip6</p>
<p>that is really good for the immune</p>
<p>system so research that ip6 and also i</p>
<p>would recommend taking seek help seek</p>
<p>help is really good to help balance</p>
<p>things in the body and then I would</p>
<p>definitely hardcore get a healthy</p>
<p>ketosis is I&rsquo;m gonna fasting reevaluate</p>
<p>with the help of a doctor in about two</p>
<p>months and see what happens that&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna say I&rsquo;m not gonna say anything</p>
<p>else</p>
<p>thanks Benson alright so Rachel you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>been waiting a long time you&rsquo;re from</p>
<p>Texas go ahead alright sorry can you</p>
<p>hear me yeah I can hear you so excited I</p>
<p>just got your keto kit and I just want</p>
<p>to tell you I guess as a someone who is</p>
<p>trying you know I&rsquo;m sure a lot of people</p>
<p>have too but your electrolyte powders I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t get forty-seven hundred grams or</p>
<p>milligrams whatever it is potassium but</p>
<p>I try to with my with the vegetable but</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t gotten the full amount well I</p>
<p>was a little over yesterday five</p>
<p>thousand thirty-eight</p>
<p>high in energy was off the charts and I</p>
<p>was so happy or no reason and I have</p>
<p>trouble</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m struggled with depression and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>all right there in your potassium Wow</p>
<p>awesome you know it&rsquo;s funny you said</p>
<p>that what you alright</p>
<p>yeah well what&rsquo;s so funny it&rsquo;s like a</p>
<p>lot of people they&rsquo;ll say I&rsquo;m depressed</p>
<p>but you know what sometimes they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>exhausted I mean try to be</p>
<p>depressed if we need a lot of energy</p>
<p>just try it like you have a lot of</p>
<p>energy and try to just be depressed it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>almost impossible so when you bring your</p>
<p>energy up it brings the mood up and also</p>
<p>the electrolyte with the potassium helps</p>
<p>insulin resistance which actually brings</p>
<p>your mood up and plus all the cell&rsquo;s</p>
<p>well need potassium for energy but go</p>
<p>ahead sorry you can interrupt any time</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m the one that called you last</p>
<p>week I&rsquo;m type one diabetic so I want</p>
<p>influence Wow your diet is phenomenal</p>
<p>you are wonderful and and I also but I</p>
<p>okay oh I wanted to say I don&rsquo;t think I</p>
<p>I was been on the comments so long on</p>
<p>hold that I don&rsquo;t even think I&rsquo;m asking</p>
<p>a question I wanted to ask you now that</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m on the phone I just wanted to show</p>
<p>you that that oh I&rsquo;ve been wanting to do</p>
<p>the intermittent fasting start at 10:00</p>
<p>and go to like 6 but I wake up kind of</p>
<p>hungry you know and I want it&rsquo;s kind of</p>
<p>hard but now that I have to take about a</p>
<p>little over 24 ounces of water to take</p>
<p>with my 16 ounces for my life so my</p>
<p>putter and my eight ounces for my rods</p>
<p>wheatgrass juice and then my more water</p>
<p>for my nutritional yeast horse pill you</p>
<p>know it keeps a key open I can start my</p>
<p>eating etiquette</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s awesome that&rsquo;s awesome I want to</p>
<p>know how am I supposed to eat 1,500</p>
<p>calories yeah do you mean tell you what</p>
<p>you can do what you can because when</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing in a minute fasting the</p>
<p>quantity of food goes down because think</p>
<p>about it you&rsquo;re not just eating those</p>
<p>calories your body is eating your own</p>
<p>fat calories so if you&rsquo;re losing a</p>
<p>couple let&rsquo;s say you lose the pound a</p>
<p>week gets another 3500 calories that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re eating on top of your regular</p>
<p>meals yeah you&rsquo;re eating that your body</p>
<p>is eating that so that&rsquo;s awesome thanks</p>
<p>Rachel</p>
<p>alright let&rsquo;s go to Sarah Samira from</p>
<p>Belgium go ahead Samir</p>
<p>hi dr. break thank you for taking my</p>
<p>call I want to ask you something I have</p>
<p>problems with digestion it&rsquo;s been three</p>
<p>years I am being on a lot of fruit and</p>
<p>vegetables only in the beginning I went</p>
<p>and I went fully roll in the beginning</p>
<p>and it felt so good I kept going on and</p>
<p>on and I could eat some time meat but</p>
<p>nowadays the last year it went it always</p>
<p>went weaker and weaker my digestion has</p>
<p>gone really weak I don&rsquo;t know what I</p>
<p>have done my liver is so congested and I</p>
<p>have tried a lot of herbs a lot of</p>
<p>things and I&rsquo;m actually underweight and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m losing more weight ooh last days</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t observe any any any food</p>
<p>at all only thing I can eat is food</p>
<p>fruit and vegetables but I wonder if my</p>
<p>girl father has some damage after after</p>
<p>being on kind of all that low-fat but</p>
<p>now fat it just gives me problem I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know how to get back to the normal ok</p>
<p>again let me tell you what to do and a</p>
<p>lot of histamine allergies and a lot of</p>
<p>problems sleep problems and losing</p>
<p>weight everyday and not be able to</p>
<p>digest without digestive enzymes so get</p>
<p>some paper I&rsquo;m gonna tell you what to do</p>
<p>right now ok so here&rsquo;s what you do</p>
<p>number one you probably need to support</p>
<p>the goal but it with some bile salts ok</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re taking enzymes but you need bile</p>
<p>salts take it after the meal that will</p>
<p>slowly start building up your bowel</p>
<p>reserves because what causes lack of</p>
<p>bile is low fat diets fat saturated fats</p>
<p>increase the production of bile you</p>
<p>probably depleted it and now you&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re trying to eat you can&rsquo;t do it and</p>
<p>especially if you&rsquo;re doing ketone them</p>
<p>in the fasting if you&rsquo;re not eating</p>
<p>enough fats you&rsquo;re gonna even lose more</p>
<p>weight so I think that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>missing you&rsquo;re gonna have to cut out the</p>
<p>fruit and add start adding a little more</p>
<p>slowly more fat maybe some fermented</p>
<p>vegetables but that that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>running into right now unfortunately so</p>
<p>a couple things you can do to also</p>
<p>support the liver and gallbladder well</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re in the Belgium so that would be</p>
<p>hard to order a couple products but if</p>
<p>you find purified bile salts and choline</p>
<p>those two together I think that&rsquo;s gonna</p>
<p>be the icing on the cake I&rsquo;m sure I</p>
<p>shouldn&rsquo;t talk about icing so go ahead</p>
<p>and do that and let us know in a couple</p>
<p>weeks give us a call back hey Jerry</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve been holding for a bit</p>
<p>how you doing you&rsquo;re from Los Angeles</p>
<p>good okay thanks for your time so my</p>
<p>question is been on keto for about nine</p>
<p>weeks and lost about 40-plus pounds but</p>
<p>recently I T yeah thank you but recently</p>
<p>I take when I take MCT oil it irritates</p>
<p>my gallbladder and pancreas yeah and I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know got it</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s one of the challenges</p>
<p>sometimes with these oils especially</p>
<p>like MCT oil it is it is a refined food</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s out of the normal complex</p>
<p>of a coconut so you&rsquo;re eating that much</p>
<p>it forces the pancreas to pump out a lot</p>
<p>of enzymes lipase to try to to try to</p>
<p>break that down so if your pancreas is</p>
<p>already weak you can kind of irritate it</p>
<p>so I would do this Jerry I would consume</p>
<p>your fats within the normal whole food</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re eating whether it&rsquo;s animal</p>
<p>protein or cheese or avocados like don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>add extra oil just eat the fats within</p>
<p>the food that you have and then add the</p>
<p>vegetables in there to give it time for</p>
<p>the pancreas to kind of recover and I</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s all you need to do and on</p>
<p>that note don&rsquo;t forget to download this</p>
<p>index right here stay tuned for more</p>
<p>videos coming up right Karen yes</p>
<p>absolutely and have a great weekend guys</p>
<p>where are you next week Friday okay</p>
