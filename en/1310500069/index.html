    <p>The following is a conversation with David Chalmers.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a philosopher and cognitive scientist</p>
<p>specializing in the areas of philosophy of mind,</p>
<p>philosophy of language, and consciousness.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s perhaps best known for formulating</p>
<p>the hard problem of consciousness,</p>
<p>which could be stated as why does the feeling</p>
<p>which accompanies awareness of sensory information</p>
<p>exist at all?</p>
<p>Consciousness is almost entirely a mystery.</p>
<p>Many people who worry about AI safety and ethics</p>
<p>believe that, in some form, consciousness can</p>
<p>and should be engineered into AI systems of the future.</p>
<p>So while there&rsquo;s much mystery, disagreement,</p>
<p>discoveries yet to be made about consciousness,</p>
<p>these conversations, while fundamentally philosophical</p>
<p>in nature, may nevertheless be very important</p>
<p>for engineers of modern AI systems to engage in.</p>
<p>This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast.</p>
<p>If you enjoy it, subscribe on YouTube,</p>
<p>give it five stars on Apple Podcast,</p>
<p>support it on Patreon, or simply connect with me</p>
<p>on Twitter at Lex Friedman, spelled F R I D M A N.</p>
<p>As usual, I&rsquo;ll do one or two minutes of ads now</p>
<p>and never any ads in the middle</p>
<p>that can break the flow of the conversation.</p>
<p>I hope that works for you</p>
<p>and doesn&rsquo;t hurt the listening experience.</p>
<p>This show is presented by Cash App,</p>
<p>the number one finance app in the App Store.</p>
<p>When you get it, use code LEXBODCAST.</p>
<p>Cash App lets you send money to friends,</p>
<p>buy Bitcoin, and invest in the stock market</p>
<p>with as little as one dollar.</p>
<p>Brokerage services are provided by Cash App Investing,</p>
<p>subsidiary of Square, and member SIPC.</p>
<p>Since Cash App does fractional share trading,</p>
<p>let me mention that the order execution algorithm</p>
<p>that works behind the scenes to create the abstraction</p>
<p>of fractional orders is an algorithmic marvel.</p>
<p>So big props to the Cash App engineers</p>
<p>for solving a hard problem that, in the end,</p>
<p>provides an easy interface that takes a step up</p>
<p>to the next layer of abstraction over the stock market,</p>
<p>making trading more accessible for new investors</p>
<p>and diversification much easier.</p>
<p>If you get Cash App from the App Store or Google Play</p>
<p>and use the code LEXBODCAST, you&rsquo;ll get $10,</p>
<p>and Cash App will also donate $10 to FIRST,</p>
<p>one of my favorite organizations</p>
<p>that is helping to advance robotics and STEM education</p>
<p>for young people around the world.</p>
<p>And now, here&rsquo;s my conversation with David Chalmers.</p>
<p>Do you think we&rsquo;re living in a simulation?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t rule it out.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s probably gonna be a lot of simulations</p>
<p>in the history of the cosmos.</p>
<p>If the simulation is designed well enough,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll be indistinguishable from a non simulated reality.</p>
<p>And although we could keep searching for evidence</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re not in a simulation,</p>
<p>any of that evidence in principle could be simulated.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s a possibility.</p>
<p>But do you think the thought experiment is interesting</p>
<p>or useful to calibrate how we think</p>
<p>about the nature of reality?</p>
<p>Yeah, I definitely think it&rsquo;s interesting and useful.</p>
<p>In fact, I&rsquo;m actually writing a book about this right now,</p>
<p>all about the simulation idea,</p>
<p>using it to shed light</p>
<p>on a whole bunch of philosophical questions.</p>
<p>So the big one is how do we know anything</p>
<p>about the external world?</p>
<p>Descartes said, maybe you&rsquo;re being fooled by an evil demon</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s stimulating your brain into thinking,</p>
<p>all this stuff is real when in fact, it&rsquo;s all made up.</p>
<p>Well, the modern version of that is,</p>
<p>how do you know you&rsquo;re not in a simulation?</p>
<p>Then the thought is, if you&rsquo;re in a simulation,</p>
<p>none of this is real.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s teaching you something about knowledge.</p>
<p>How do you know about the external world?</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s also really interesting questions</p>
<p>about the nature of reality right here.</p>
<p>If we are in a simulation, is all this real?</p>
<p>Is there really a table here?</p>
<p>Is it really a microphone?</p>
<p>Do I really have a body?</p>
<p>The standard view would be, no, we don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>None of this would be real.</p>
<p>My view is actually that&rsquo;s wrong.</p>
<p>And even if we are in a simulation, all of this is real.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I called this reality 2.0.</p>
<p>New version of reality, different version of reality,</p>
<p>still reality.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the difference between quote unquote,</p>
<p>real world and the world that we perceive?</p>
<p>So we interact with the world by perceiving it.</p>
<p>It only really exists through the window</p>
<p>of our perception system and in our mind.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the difference between something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s quote unquote real, that exists perhaps</p>
<p>without us being there, and the world as you perceive it?</p>
<p>Well the world as we perceive it is a very simplified</p>
<p>and distorted version of what&rsquo;s going on underneath.</p>
<p>We already know that from just thinking about science.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t see too many obviously quantum mechanical effects</p>
<p>in what we perceive, but we still know quantum mechanics</p>
<p>is going on under all things.</p>
<p>So I like to think the world we perceive</p>
<p>is this very kind of simplified picture of colors</p>
<p>and shapes existing in space and so on.</p>
<p>We know there&rsquo;s a, that&rsquo;s what the philosopher</p>
<p>Wilfred Sellers called the manifest image.</p>
<p>The world as it seems to us, we already know</p>
<p>underneath all that is a very different scientific image</p>
<p>with atoms or quantum wave functions or super strings</p>
<p>or whatever the latest thing is.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the ultimate scientific reality.</p>
<p>So I think of the simulation idea as basically</p>
<p>another hypothesis about what the ultimate</p>
<p>say quasi scientific or metaphysical reality</p>
<p>is going on underneath the world of the manifest image.</p>
<p>The world of the manifest image is this very simple thing</p>
<p>that we interact with that&rsquo;s neutral</p>
<p>on the underlying stuff of reality.</p>
<p>Science can help tell us about that.</p>
<p>Maybe philosophy can help tell us about that too.</p>
<p>And if we eventually take the red pill</p>
<p>and find out we&rsquo;re in a simulation,</p>
<p>my view is that&rsquo;s just another view</p>
<p>about what reality is made of.</p>
<p>The philosopher Immanuel Kant said,</p>
<p>what is the nature of the thing in itself?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got a glass here and it&rsquo;s got all these,</p>
<p>it appears to me a certain way, a certain shape,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s liquid, it&rsquo;s clear.</p>
<p>And he said, what is the nature of the thing</p>
<p>in itself?</p>
<p>Well, I think of the simulation idea,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a hypothesis about the nature of the thing in itself.</p>
<p>It turns out if we&rsquo;re in a simulation,</p>
<p>the thing in itself nature of this glass,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s okay, it&rsquo;s actually a bunch of data structures</p>
<p>running on a computer in the next universe up.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s what people tend to do</p>
<p>when they think about simulation.</p>
<p>They think about our modern computers</p>
<p>and somehow trivially crudely just scaled up in some sense.</p>
<p>But do you think the simulation,</p>
<p>I mean, in order to actually simulate</p>
<p>something as complicated as our universe</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s made up of molecules and atoms</p>
<p>and particles and quarks and maybe even strings,</p>
<p>all of that would require something</p>
<p>just infinitely many orders of magnitude more</p>
<p>of scale and complexity.</p>
<p>Do you think we&rsquo;re even able to even like conceptualize</p>
<p>what it would take to simulate our universe?</p>
<p>Or does it just slip into this idea</p>
<p>that you basically have to build a universe,</p>
<p>something so big to simulate it?</p>
<p>Does it get this into this fuzzy area</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not useful at all?</p>
<p>Yeah, well, I mean, our universe</p>
<p>is obviously incredibly complicated.</p>
<p>And for us within our universe to build a simulation</p>
<p>of a universe as complicated as ours</p>
<p>is gonna have obvious problems here.</p>
<p>If the universe is finite,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s just no way that&rsquo;s gonna work.</p>
<p>Maybe there&rsquo;s some cute way to make it work</p>
<p>if the universe is infinite,</p>
<p>maybe an infinite universe could somehow simulate</p>
<p>a copy of itself, but that&rsquo;s gonna be hard.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, just that we are in a simulation,</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s no particular reason</p>
<p>why we have to think the simulating universe</p>
<p>has to be anything like ours.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve said before that it might be,</p>
<p>so you could think of it in turtles all the way down.</p>
<p>You could think of the simulating universe</p>
<p>different than ours, but we ourselves</p>
<p>could also create another simulating universe.</p>
<p>So you said that there could be these</p>
<p>kind of levels of universes.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ve also mentioned this hilarious idea,</p>
<p>maybe tongue in cheek, maybe not,</p>
<p>that there may be simulations within simulations,</p>
<p>arbitrarily stacked levels,</p>
<p>and that there may be, that we may be in level 42.</p>
<p>Oh yeah.</p>
<p>Along those stacks, referencing Hitchhiker&rsquo;s Guide</p>
<p>to the Universe.</p>
<p>If we&rsquo;re indeed in a simulation within a simulation</p>
<p>at level 42, what do you think level zero looks like?</p>
<p>The originating universe.</p>
<p>I would expect that level zero is truly enormous.</p>
<p>I mean, not just, if it&rsquo;s finite,</p>
<p>at some extraordinarily large finite capacity,</p>
<p>much more likely it&rsquo;s infinite.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s got some very high cardinality</p>
<p>that enables it to support just any number of simulations.</p>
<p>So high degree of infinity at level zero,</p>
<p>slightly smaller degree of infinity at level one.</p>
<p>So by the time you get down to us at level 42,</p>
<p>maybe there&rsquo;s plenty of room for lots of simulations</p>
<p>of finite capacity.</p>
<p>If the top universe is only a small finite capacity,</p>
<p>then obviously that&rsquo;s gonna put very, very serious limits</p>
<p>on how many simulations you&rsquo;re gonna be able to get running.</p>
<p>So I think we can certainly confidently say</p>
<p>that if we&rsquo;re at level 42,</p>
<p>then the top level&rsquo;s pretty damn big.</p>
<p>So it gets more and more constrained</p>
<p>as we get down levels, more and more simplified</p>
<p>and constrained and limited in resources.</p>
<p>Yeah, we still have plenty of capacity here.</p>
<p>What was it Feynman said?</p>
<p>He said there&rsquo;s plenty of room at the bottom.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re still a number of levels above the degree</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s room for fundamental computing,</p>
<p>physical computing capacity,</p>
<p>quantum computing capacity at the bottom level.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve got plenty of room to play with</p>
<p>and we probably have plenty of room</p>
<p>for simulations of pretty sophisticated universes,</p>
<p>perhaps none as complicated as our universe,</p>
<p>unless our universe is infinite,</p>
<p>but still at the very least</p>
<p>for pretty serious finite universes,</p>
<p>but maybe universes somewhat simpler than ours,</p>
<p>unless of course we&rsquo;re prepared to take certain shortcuts</p>
<p>in the simulation,</p>
<p>which might then increase the capacity significantly.</p>
<p>Do you think the human mind, us people,</p>
<p>in terms of the complexity of simulation</p>
<p>is at the height of what the simulation</p>
<p>might be able to achieve?</p>
<p>Like if you look at incredible entities</p>
<p>that could be created in this universe of ours,</p>
<p>do you have an intuition about</p>
<p>how incredible human beings are on that scale?</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re pretty impressive,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re not that impressive.</p>
<p>Are we above average?</p>
<p>I mean, I think human beings are at a certain point</p>
<p>in the scale of intelligence,</p>
<p>which made many things possible.</p>
<p>You get through evolution, through single cell organisms,</p>
<p>through fish and mammals and primates,</p>
<p>and something happens.</p>
<p>Once you get to human beings,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve just reached that level</p>
<p>where we get to develop language,</p>
<p>we get to develop certain kinds of culture,</p>
<p>and we get to develop certain kinds of collective thinking</p>
<p>that has enabled all this amazing stuff to happen,</p>
<p>science and literature and engineering</p>
<p>and culture and so on.</p>
<p>So we had just at the beginning of that</p>
<p>on the evolutionary threshold,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of like we just got there,</p>
<p>who knows, a few thousand or tens of thousands of years ago.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re probably just at the very beginning</p>
<p>for what&rsquo;s possible there.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m inclined to think among the scale</p>
<p>of intelligent beings,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re somewhere very near the bottom.</p>
<p>I would expect that, for example,</p>
<p>if we&rsquo;re in a simulation,</p>
<p>then the simulators who created us</p>
<p>have got the capacity to be far more sophisticated.</p>
<p>If we&rsquo;re at level 42,</p>
<p>who knows what the ones at level zero are like.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also possible that this is the epitome</p>
<p>of what is possible to achieve.</p>
<p>So we as human beings see ourselves maybe as flawed,</p>
<p>see all the constraints, all the limitations,</p>
<p>but maybe that&rsquo;s the magical, the beautiful thing.</p>
<p>Maybe those limitations are the essential elements</p>
<p>for an interesting sort of that edge of chaos,</p>
<p>that interesting existence,</p>
<p>that if you make us much more intelligent,</p>
<p>if you make us much more powerful</p>
<p>in any kind of dimension of performance,</p>
<p>maybe you lose something fundamental</p>
<p>that makes life worth living.</p>
<p>So you kind of have this optimistic view</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re this little baby,</p>
<p>that then there&rsquo;s so much growth and potential,</p>
<p>but this could also be it.</p>
<p>This is the most amazing thing is us.</p>
<p>Maybe what you&rsquo;re saying is consistent</p>
<p>with what I&rsquo;m saying.</p>
<p>I mean, we could still have levels of intelligence</p>
<p>far beyond us,</p>
<p>but maybe those levels of intelligence on your view</p>
<p>would be kind of boring.</p>
<p>And we kind of get so good at everything</p>
<p>that life suddenly becomes uni dimensional.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re just inhabiting this one spot</p>
<p>of like maximal romanticism in the history of evolution.</p>
<p>You get to humans and it&rsquo;s like, yeah,</p>
<p>and then years to come, our super intelligent descendants</p>
<p>are gonna look back at us and say,</p>
<p>those were the days when they just hit</p>
<p>the point of inflection and life was interesting.</p>
<p>I am an optimist.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;d like to think that if there is super intelligent</p>
<p>somewhere in the future,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll figure out how to make life super interesting</p>
<p>and super romantic.</p>
<p>Well, you know what they&rsquo;re gonna do.</p>
<p>So what they&rsquo;re gonna do is they realize</p>
<p>how boring life is when you&rsquo;re super intelligent.</p>
<p>So they create a new level of assimilation</p>
<p>and sort of live through the things they&rsquo;ve created</p>
<p>by watching them stumble about</p>
<p>in their flawed ways.</p>
<p>So maybe that&rsquo;s, so you create a new level of assimilation</p>
<p>every time you get really bored with how smart and.</p>
<p>This would be kind of sad though,</p>
<p>because if we showed the peak of their existence</p>
<p>would be like watching simulations for entertainment.</p>
<p>Not like saying the peak of our existence now is Netflix.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s all right.</p>
<p>A flip side of that could be the peak of our existence</p>
<p>for many people having children and watching them grow.</p>
<p>That becomes very meaningful.</p>
<p>Okay, you create a simulation that&rsquo;s like creating a family.</p>
<p>Creating like, well, any kind of creation</p>
<p>is kind of a powerful act.</p>
<p>Do you think it&rsquo;s easier to simulate the mind</p>
<p>or the universe?</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve heard several people, including Nick Bostrom,</p>
<p>think about ideas of maybe you don&rsquo;t need</p>
<p>to simulate the universe,</p>
<p>you can just simulate the human mind.</p>
<p>Or in general, just the distinction</p>
<p>between simulating the entirety of it,</p>
<p>the entirety of the physical world,</p>
<p>or just simulating the mind.</p>
<p>Which one do you see as more challenging?</p>
<p>Well, I think in some sense, the answer is obvious.</p>
<p>It has to be simpler to simulate the mind</p>
<p>than to simulate the universe,</p>
<p>because the mind is part of the universe.</p>
<p>And in order to fully simulate the universe,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna have to simulate the mind.</p>
<p>So unless we&rsquo;re talking about partial simulations.</p>
<p>And I guess the question is which comes first?</p>
<p>Does the mind come before the universe</p>
<p>or does the universe come before the mind?</p>
<p>So the mind could just be an emergent phenomena</p>
<p>in this universe.</p>
<p>So simulation is an interesting thing</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s not like creating a simulation perhaps</p>
<p>requires you to program every single thing</p>
<p>that happens in it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just defining a set of initial conditions</p>
<p>and rules based on which it behaves.</p>
<p>Simulating the mind requires you</p>
<p>to have a little bit more,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re now in a little bit of a crazy land,</p>
<p>but it requires you to understand</p>
<p>the fundamentals of cognition,</p>
<p>perhaps of consciousness,</p>
<p>of perception of everything like that,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not created through some kind of emergence</p>
<p>from basic physics laws,</p>
<p>but more requires you to actually understand</p>
<p>the fundamentals of the mind.</p>
<p>How about if we said to simulate the brain?</p>
<p>The brain.</p>
<p>Rather than the mind.</p>
<p>So the brain is just a big physical system.</p>
<p>The universe is a giant physical system.</p>
<p>To simulate the universe at the very least,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna have to simulate the brains</p>
<p>as well as all the other physical systems within it.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not obvious that the problems are any worse</p>
<p>for the brain than for,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a particularly complex physical system.</p>
<p>But if we can simulate arbitrary physical systems,</p>
<p>we can simulate brains.</p>
<p>There is this further question of whether,</p>
<p>when you simulate a brain,</p>
<p>will that bring along all the features of the mind with it?</p>
<p>Like will you get consciousness?</p>
<p>Will you get thinking?</p>
<p>Will you get free will?</p>
<p>And so on.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s something philosophers have argued over</p>
<p>for years.</p>
<p>My own view is if you simulate the brain well enough,</p>
<p>that will also simulate the mind.</p>
<p>But yeah, there&rsquo;s plenty of people who would say no.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d merely get like a zombie system,</p>
<p>a simulation of a brain without any true consciousness.</p>
<p>But for you, you put together a brain,</p>
<p>the consciousness comes with it, arise.</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s obvious.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s your intuition.</p>
<p>My view is roughly that yeah,</p>
<p>what is responsible for consciousness,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s in the patterns of information processing and so on</p>
<p>rather than say the biology that it&rsquo;s made of.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s certainly plenty of people out there</p>
<p>who think consciousness has to be say biological.</p>
<p>So if you merely replicate the patterns of information</p>
<p>processing in a nonbiological substrate,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll miss what&rsquo;s crucial for consciousness.</p>
<p>I mean, I just don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s any particular reason</p>
<p>to think that biology is special here.</p>
<p>You can imagine substituting the biology</p>
<p>for nonbiological systems, say silicon circuits</p>
<p>that play the same role.</p>
<p>The behavior will continue to be the same.</p>
<p>And I think just thinking about what is the true,</p>
<p>when I think about the connection,</p>
<p>the isomorphisms between consciousness and the brain,</p>
<p>the deepest connections to me seem to connect consciousness</p>
<p>to patterns of information processing,</p>
<p>not to specific biology.</p>
<p>So I at least adopted as my working hypothesis</p>
<p>that basically it&rsquo;s the computation and the information</p>
<p>that matters for consciousness.</p>
<p>Same time, we don&rsquo;t understand consciousness,</p>
<p>so all this could be wrong.</p>
<p>So the computation, the flow, the processing,</p>
<p>manipulation of information,</p>
<p>the process is where the consciousness,</p>
<p>the software is where the consciousness comes from,</p>
<p>not the hardware.</p>
<p>Roughly the software, yeah.</p>
<p>The patterns of information processing at least</p>
<p>in the hardware, which we could view as software.</p>
<p>It may not be something you can just like program</p>
<p>and load and erase and so on in the way we can</p>
<p>with ordinary software, but it&rsquo;s something at the level</p>
<p>of information processing rather than at the level</p>
<p>of implementation.</p>
<p>So on that, what do you think of the experience of self,</p>
<p>just the experience of the world in a virtual world,</p>
<p>in virtual reality?</p>
<p>Is it possible that we can create sort of</p>
<p>offsprings of our consciousness by existing</p>
<p>in a virtual world long enough?</p>
<p>So yeah, can we be conscious in the same kind</p>
<p>of deep way that we are in this real world</p>
<p>by hanging out in a virtual world?</p>
<p>Yeah, well, the kind of virtual worlds we have now</p>
<p>are interesting but limited in certain ways.</p>
<p>In particular, they rely on us having a brain and so on,</p>
<p>which is outside the virtual world.</p>
<p>Maybe I&rsquo;ll strap on my VR headset or just hang out</p>
<p>in a virtual world on a screen, but my brain</p>
<p>and then my physical environment might be simulated</p>
<p>if I&rsquo;m in a virtual world, but right now,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no attempt to simulate my brain.</p>
<p>There might be some non player characters</p>
<p>in these virtual worlds that have simulated</p>
<p>cognitive systems of certain kinds</p>
<p>that dictate their behavior, but mostly,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re pretty simple right now.</p>
<p>I mean, some people are trying to combine,</p>
<p>put a bit of AI in their non player characters</p>
<p>to make them smarter, but for now,</p>
<p>inside virtual world, the actual thinking</p>
<p>is interestingly distinct from the physics</p>
<p>of those virtual worlds.</p>
<p>In a way, actually, I like to think this is kind of</p>
<p>reminiscent of the way that Descartes</p>
<p>thought our physical world was.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s physics, and there&rsquo;s the mind,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re separate.</p>
<p>Now we think the mind is somehow connected</p>
<p>to physics pretty deeply, but in these virtual worlds,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a physics of a virtual world,</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s this brain which is totally</p>
<p>outside the virtual world that controls it</p>
<p>and interacts it when anyone exercises agency</p>
<p>in a video game, that&rsquo;s actually somebody</p>
<p>outside the virtual world moving a controller,</p>
<p>controlling the interaction of things</p>
<p>inside the virtual world.</p>
<p>So right now, in virtual worlds,</p>
<p>the mind is somehow outside the world,</p>
<p>but you could imagine in the future,</p>
<p>once we have developed serious AI,</p>
<p>artificial general intelligence, and so on,</p>
<p>then we could come to virtual worlds</p>
<p>which have enough sophistication,</p>
<p>you could actually simulate a brain</p>
<p>or have a genuine AGI, which would then presumably</p>
<p>be able to act in equally sophisticated ways,</p>
<p>maybe even more sophisticated ways,</p>
<p>inside the virtual world to how it might</p>
<p>in the physical world, and then the question&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna come along, that would be kind of a VR,</p>
<p>virtual world internal intelligence,</p>
<p>and then the question is could they have consciousness,</p>
<p>experience, intelligence, free will,</p>
<p>all the things that we have, and again,</p>
<p>my view is I don&rsquo;t see why not.</p>
<p>To linger on it a little bit, I find virtual reality really</p>
<p>incredibly powerful, just even the crude virtual reality</p>
<p>we have now of perhaps there&rsquo;s psychological effects</p>
<p>that make some people more amenable</p>
<p>to virtual worlds than others, but I find myself</p>
<p>wanting to stay in virtual worlds for the most part.</p>
<p>You do?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>With a headset or on a desktop?</p>
<p>No, with a headset.</p>
<p>Really interesting, because I am totally addicted</p>
<p>to using the internet and things on a desktop,</p>
<p>but when it comes to VR, with a headset,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t typically use it for more than 10 or 20 minutes.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something just slightly aversive about it, I find,</p>
<p>so I don&rsquo;t, right now, even though I have Oculus Rift</p>
<p>and Oculus Quest and HTC Vive and Samsung, this and that.</p>
<p>You just don&rsquo;t wanna stay in that world for long.</p>
<p>Not for extended periods.</p>
<p>You actually find yourself hanging out in that.</p>
<p>Something about, it&rsquo;s both a combination</p>
<p>of just imagination and considering the possibilities</p>
<p>of where this goes in the future.</p>
<p>It feels like I want to almost prepare my brain for it.</p>
<p>I wanna explore sort of Disneyland</p>
<p>when it&rsquo;s first being built in the early days,</p>
<p>and it feels like I&rsquo;m walking around</p>
<p>almost imagining the possibilities,</p>
<p>and something through that process allows my mind</p>
<p>to really enter into that world,</p>
<p>but you say that the brain is external to that virtual world.</p>
<p>It is, strictly speaking, true, but&hellip;</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re in VR and you do brain surgery on an avatar,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re gonna open up that skull,</p>
<p>what are you gonna find?</p>
<p>Sorry, nothing there.</p>
<p>Nothing.</p>
<p>The brain is elsewhere.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s possible to kind of separate them,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t mean in a sense like Descartes,</p>
<p>like a hard separation, but basically,</p>
<p>do you think it&rsquo;s possible with the brain outside</p>
<p>of the virtual rhythm, when you&rsquo;re wearing a headset,</p>
<p>create a new consciousness for prolonged periods of time?</p>
<p>Really feel, like really, like forget</p>
<p>that your brain is outside.</p>
<p>So this is, okay, this is gonna be the case</p>
<p>where the brain is still outside.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s still outside.</p>
<p>But could living in the VR, I mean,</p>
<p>we already find this, right, with video games.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re completely immersive, and you get taken up</p>
<p>by living in those worlds,</p>
<p>and it becomes your reality for a while.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re not completely immersive,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re just very immersive.</p>
<p>Completely immersive.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t forget the external world, no.</p>
<p>Exactly, so that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m asking.</p>
<p>Do you think it&rsquo;s almost possible</p>
<p>to really forget the external world?</p>
<p>Really, really immerse yourself.</p>
<p>To forget completely?</p>
<p>Why would we forget?</p>
<p>We got pretty good memories.</p>
<p>Maybe you can stop paying attention to the external world,</p>
<p>but this already happens a lot.</p>
<p>I go to work, and maybe I&rsquo;m not paying attention</p>
<p>to my home life.</p>
<p>I go to a movie, and I&rsquo;m immersed in that.</p>
<p>So that degree of immersion, absolutely.</p>
<p>But we still have the capacity to remember it,</p>
<p>to completely forget the external world.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m thinking that would probably take some,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, some pretty serious drugs or something</p>
<p>to make your brain do that.</p>
<p>Is that possible?</p>
<p>So, I mean, I guess what I&rsquo;m getting at</p>
<p>is consciousness truly a property</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s tied to the physical brain?</p>
<p>Or can you create sort of different offspring,</p>
<p>copies of consciousnesses based on the worlds</p>
<p>that you enter?</p>
<p>Well, the way we&rsquo;re doing it now,</p>
<p>at least with a standard VR, there&rsquo;s just one brain.</p>
<p>Interacts with the physical world.</p>
<p>Plays a video game, puts on a video headset,</p>
<p>interacts with this virtual world.</p>
<p>And I think we&rsquo;d typically say there&rsquo;s one consciousness here</p>
<p>that nonetheless undergoes different environments,</p>
<p>takes on different characters in different environments.</p>
<p>This is already something that happens</p>
<p>in the nonvirtual world.</p>
<p>I might interact one way in my home life,</p>
<p>my work life, my social life, and so on.</p>
<p>So at the very least, that will happen</p>
<p>in a virtual world very naturally.</p>
<p>People sometimes adopt the character of avatars</p>
<p>very different from themselves,</p>
<p>maybe even a different gender, different race,</p>
<p>different social background.</p>
<p>So that much is certainly possible.</p>
<p>I would see that as a single consciousness</p>
<p>is taking on different personas.</p>
<p>If you want literal splitting of consciousness</p>
<p>into multiple copies,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s gonna take something more radical than that.</p>
<p>Like maybe you can run different simulations of your brain</p>
<p>in different realities</p>
<p>and then expose them to different histories.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;d split yourself</p>
<p>into 10 different simulated copies,</p>
<p>which then undergo different environments</p>
<p>and then ultimately do become 10</p>
<p>very different consciousnesses.</p>
<p>Maybe that could happen,</p>
<p>but now we&rsquo;re not talking about something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s possible in the near term.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna have to have brain simulations</p>
<p>and AGI for that to happen.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>So before any of that happens,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s fundamentally you see it as a singular consciousness,</p>
<p>even though it&rsquo;s experiencing different environments,</p>
<p>virtual or not,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s still connected to same set of memories,</p>
<p>same set of experiences and therefore,</p>
<p>one sort of joint conscious system.</p>
<p>Yeah, or at least no more multiple</p>
<p>than the kind of multiple consciousness</p>
<p>that we get from inhabiting different environments</p>
<p>in a non virtual world.</p>
<p>So you said as a child,</p>
<p>you were a music color synesthete.</p>
<p>So where songs had colors for you.</p>
<p>So what songs had what colors?</p>
<p>You know, this is funny.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t pay much attention to this at the time,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;d listen to a piece of music</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;d get some kind of imagery</p>
<p>of a kind of color.</p>
<p>The weird thing is mostly they were kind of murky,</p>
<p>dark greens and olive browns</p>
<p>and the colors weren&rsquo;t all that interesting.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what the reason is.</p>
<p>I mean, my theory is that maybe it&rsquo;s like different chords</p>
<p>and tones provided different colors</p>
<p>and they all tended to get mixed together</p>
<p>into these somewhat uninteresting browns and greens.</p>
<p>But every now and then there&rsquo;d be something</p>
<p>that had a really pure color.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s just a few that I remember.</p>
<p>There was a Here, There and Everywhere by the Beatles</p>
<p>was bright red and has this very distinctive tonality</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s called structure at the beginning.</p>
<p>So that was bright red.</p>
<p>There was this song by the Alan Parsons Project</p>
<p>called Ammonia Avenue that was kind of a pure, a pure blue.</p>
<p>Anyway, I&rsquo;ve got no idea how this happened.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t even pay that much attention</p>
<p>until it went away when I was about 20.</p>
<p>This synesthesia often goes away.</p>
<p>So is it purely just the perception of a particular color</p>
<p>or was there a positive or negative experience?</p>
<p>Like was blue associated with a positive</p>
<p>and red with a negative?</p>
<p>Or is it simply the perception of color</p>
<p>associated with some characteristic of the song?</p>
<p>For me, I don&rsquo;t remember a lot of association</p>
<p>with emotion or with value.</p>
<p>It was just this kind of weird and interesting fact.</p>
<p>I mean, at the beginning, I thought this was something</p>
<p>that happened to everyone, songs of colors.</p>
<p>Maybe I mentioned it once or twice and people said, nope.</p>
<p>I thought it was kind of cool when there was one</p>
<p>that had one of these especially pure colors,</p>
<p>but only much later once I became a grad student</p>
<p>thinking about the mind that I read about this phenomenon</p>
<p>called synesthesia and I was like, hey, that&rsquo;s what I had.</p>
<p>And now I occasionally talk about it in my classes,</p>
<p>in intro class and it still happens sometimes.</p>
<p>A student comes up and says, hey, I have that.</p>
<p>I never knew about that.</p>
<p>I never knew it had a name.</p>
<p>You said that it went away at age 20 or so.</p>
<p>And that you have a journal entry from around then saying,</p>
<p>songs don&rsquo;t have colors anymore.</p>
<p>What happened?</p>
<p>Yeah, it was definitely sad that it was gone.</p>
<p>In retrospect, it was like, hey, that&rsquo;s cool.</p>
<p>The colors have gone.</p>
<p>Yeah, can you think about that for a little bit?</p>
<p>Do you miss those experiences?</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s a fundamentally different set of experiences</p>
<p>that you no longer have.</p>
<p>Or is it just a nice thing to have had?</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t see them as that fundamentally different</p>
<p>than you visiting a new country and experiencing</p>
<p>new environments.</p>
<p>I guess for me, when I had these experiences,</p>
<p>they were somewhat marginal.</p>
<p>They were like a little bonus kind of experience.</p>
<p>I know there are people who have much more serious forms</p>
<p>of synesthesia than this for whom it&rsquo;s absolutely central</p>
<p>to their lives.</p>
<p>I know people who, when they experience new people,</p>
<p>they have colors, maybe they have tastes and so on.</p>
<p>Every time they see writing, it has colors.</p>
<p>Some people, whenever they hear music,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s got a certain really rich color pattern.</p>
<p>For some synesthetes, it&rsquo;s absolutely central.</p>
<p>I think if they lost it, they&rsquo;d be devastated.</p>
<p>Again, for me, it was a very, very mild form</p>
<p>of synesthesia, and it&rsquo;s like, yeah,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like those interesting experiences</p>
<p>you might get under different altered states</p>
<p>of consciousness and so on.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of cool, but not necessarily</p>
<p>the single most important experiences in your life.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s try to go to the very simplest question</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve answered many a time,</p>
<p>but perhaps the simplest things can help us reveal,</p>
<p>even in time, some new ideas.</p>
<p>So what, in your view, is consciousness?</p>
<p>What is qualia?</p>
<p>What is the hard problem of consciousness?</p>
<p>Consciousness, I mean, the word is used many ways,</p>
<p>but the kind of consciousness that I&rsquo;m interested in</p>
<p>is basically subjective experience,</p>
<p>what it feels like from the inside to be a human being</p>
<p>or any other conscious being.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s something it&rsquo;s like to be me right now.</p>
<p>I have visual images that I&rsquo;m experiencing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m hearing my voice.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got maybe some emotional tone.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got a stream of thoughts running through my head.</p>
<p>These are all things that I experience</p>
<p>from the first person point of view.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve sometimes called this the inner movie in the mind.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a perfect metaphor.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like a movie in every way,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s very rich.</p>
<p>But yeah, it&rsquo;s just direct, subjective experience.</p>
<p>And I call that consciousness,</p>
<p>or sometimes philosophers use the word qualia,</p>
<p>which you suggested.</p>
<p>People tend to use the word qualia</p>
<p>for things like the qualities of things like colors,</p>
<p>redness, the experience of redness</p>
<p>versus the experience of greenness,</p>
<p>the experience of one taste or one smell versus another,</p>
<p>the experience of the quality of pain.</p>
<p>And yeah, a lot of consciousness</p>
<p>is the experience of those qualities.</p>
<p>Well, consciousness is bigger,</p>
<p>the entirety of any kinds of experiences.</p>
<p>Consciousness of thinking is not obviously qualia.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like specific qualities like redness or greenness,</p>
<p>but still I&rsquo;m thinking about my hometown.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m thinking about what I&rsquo;m gonna do later on.</p>
<p>Maybe there&rsquo;s still something running through my head,</p>
<p>which is subjective experience.</p>
<p>Maybe it goes beyond those qualities or qualia.</p>
<p>Philosophers sometimes use the word phenomenal consciousness</p>
<p>for consciousness in this sense.</p>
<p>I mean, people also talk about access consciousness,</p>
<p>being able to access information in your mind,</p>
<p>reflective consciousness,</p>
<p>being able to think about yourself.</p>
<p>But it looks like the really mysterious one,</p>
<p>the one that really gets people going</p>
<p>is phenomenal consciousness.</p>
<p>The fact that there&rsquo;s subjective experience</p>
<p>and all this feels like something at all.</p>
<p>And then the hard problem is how is it that,</p>
<p>why is it that there is phenomenal consciousness at all?</p>
<p>And how is it that physical processes in a brain</p>
<p>could give you subjective experience?</p>
<p>It looks like on the face of it,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d have all this big complicated physical system</p>
<p>in a brain running without a given</p>
<p>subjective experience at all.</p>
<p>And yet we do have subjective experience.</p>
<p>So the hard problem is just explain that.</p>
<p>Explain how that comes about.</p>
<p>We haven&rsquo;t been able to build machines</p>
<p>where a red light goes on that says it&rsquo;s not conscious.</p>
<p>So how do we actually create that?</p>
<p>Or how do humans do it?</p>
<p>And how do we ourselves do it?</p>
<p>We do every now and then create machines that can do this.</p>
<p>We create babies that are conscious.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve got these brains.</p>
<p>That brain does produce consciousness.</p>
<p>But even though we can create it,</p>
<p>we still don&rsquo;t understand why it happens.</p>
<p>Maybe eventually we&rsquo;ll be able to create machines,</p>
<p>which as a matter of fact, AI machines,</p>
<p>which as a matter of fact are conscious.</p>
<p>But that won&rsquo;t necessarily make the hard problem go away</p>
<p>any more than it does with babies.</p>
<p>Cause we still wanna know how and why is it</p>
<p>that these processes give you consciousness?</p>
<p>You just made me realize for a second,</p>
<p>maybe it&rsquo;s a totally dumb realization, but nevertheless,</p>
<p>that as a useful way to think about</p>
<p>the creation of consciousness is looking at a baby.</p>
<p>So that there&rsquo;s a certain point</p>
<p>at which that baby is not conscious.</p>
<p>The baby starts from maybe, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>from a few cells, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a certain point at which it becomes consciousness,</p>
<p>arrives, it&rsquo;s conscious.</p>
<p>Of course, we can&rsquo;t know exactly that line,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s a useful idea that we do create consciousness.</p>
<p>Again, a really dumb thing for me to say,</p>
<p>but not until now did I realize</p>
<p>we do engineer consciousness.</p>
<p>We get to watch the process happen.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know which point it happens or where it is,</p>
<p>but we do see the birth of consciousness.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, there&rsquo;s a question, of course,</p>
<p>is whether babies are conscious when they&rsquo;re born.</p>
<p>And it used to be, it seems,</p>
<p>at least some people thought they weren&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>which is why they didn&rsquo;t give anesthetics</p>
<p>to newborn babies when they circumcised them.</p>
<p>And so now people think, oh, that would be incredibly cruel.</p>
<p>Of course, babies feel pain.</p>
<p>And now the dominant view is that the babies can feel pain.</p>
<p>Actually, my partner Claudia works on this whole issue</p>
<p>of whether there&rsquo;s consciousness in babies</p>
<p>and of what kind.</p>
<p>And she certainly thinks that newborn babies</p>
<p>come into the world with some degree of consciousness.</p>
<p>Of course, then you can just extend the question backwards</p>
<p>to fetuses and suddenly you&rsquo;re into</p>
<p>politically controversial territory.</p>
<p>But the question also arises in the animal kingdom.</p>
<p>Where does consciousness start or stop?</p>
<p>Is there a line in the animal kingdom</p>
<p>where the first conscious organisms are?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting, over time,</p>
<p>people are becoming more and more liberal</p>
<p>about ascribing consciousness to animals.</p>
<p>People used to think maybe only mammals could be conscious.</p>
<p>Now most people seem to think, sure, fish are conscious.</p>
<p>They can feel pain.</p>
<p>And now we&rsquo;re arguing over insects.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll find people out there who say plants</p>
<p>have some degree of consciousness.</p>
<p>So, you know, who knows where it&rsquo;s gonna end.</p>
<p>The far end of this chain is the view</p>
<p>that every physical system has some degree of consciousness.</p>
<p>Philosophers call that panpsychism.</p>
<p>You know, I take that view.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s a fascinating way to view reality.</p>
<p>So if you could talk about,</p>
<p>if you can linger on panpsychism for a little bit,</p>
<p>what does it mean?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not just plants are conscious.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s that consciousness</p>
<p>is a fundamental fabric of reality.</p>
<p>What does that mean to you?</p>
<p>How are we supposed to think about that?</p>
<p>Well, we&rsquo;re used to the idea that some things in the world</p>
<p>are fundamental, right, in physics.</p>
<p>Like what?</p>
<p>We take things like space or time or space time,</p>
<p>mass, charges, fundamental properties of the universe.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t reduce them to something simpler.</p>
<p>You take those for granted.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got some laws that connect them.</p>
<p>Here is how mass and space and time evolve.</p>
<p>Theories like relativity or quantum mechanics</p>
<p>or some future theory that will unify them both.</p>
<p>But everyone says you gotta take some things as fundamental.</p>
<p>And if you can&rsquo;t explain one thing,</p>
<p>in terms of the previous fundamental things,</p>
<p>you have to expand.</p>
<p>Maybe something like this happened with Maxwell.</p>
<p>He ended up with fundamental principles</p>
<p>of electromagnetism and took charge as fundamental</p>
<p>because it turned out that was the best way to explain it.</p>
<p>So I at least take seriously the possibility</p>
<p>something like that could happen with consciousness.</p>
<p>Take it as a fundamental property,</p>
<p>like space, time, and mass.</p>
<p>And instead of trying to explain consciousness wholly</p>
<p>in terms of the evolution of space, time, and mass,</p>
<p>and so on, take it as a primitive</p>
<p>and then connect it to everything else</p>
<p>by some fundamental laws.</p>
<p>Because there&rsquo;s this basic problem</p>
<p>that the physics we have now looks great</p>
<p>for solving the easy problems of consciousness,</p>
<p>which are all about behavior.</p>
<p>They give us a complicated structure and dynamics.</p>
<p>They tell us how things are gonna behave,</p>
<p>what kind of observable behavior they&rsquo;ll produce,</p>
<p>which is great for the problems of explaining how we walk</p>
<p>and how we talk and so on.</p>
<p>Those are the easy problems of consciousness.</p>
<p>But the hard problem was this problem</p>
<p>about subjective experience just doesn&rsquo;t look</p>
<p>like that kind of problem about structure,</p>
<p>dynamics, how things behave.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s hard to see how existing physics</p>
<p>is gonna give you a full explanation of that.</p>
<p>Certainly trying to get a physics view of consciousness,</p>
<p>yes, there has to be a connecting point</p>
<p>and it could be at the very axiomatic</p>
<p>at the very beginning level.</p>
<p>But first of all, there&rsquo;s a crazy idea</p>
<p>that sort of everything has properties of consciousness.</p>
<p>At that point, the word consciousness</p>
<p>is already beyond the reach of our current understanding.</p>
<p>Like far, because it&rsquo;s so far from,</p>
<p>at least for me, maybe you can correct me,</p>
<p>as far from the experiences that I have as a human being.</p>
<p>To say that everything is conscious,</p>
<p>that means that basically another way to put that,</p>
<p>if that&rsquo;s true, then we understand almost nothing</p>
<p>about that fundamental aspect of the world.</p>
<p>How do you feel about saying an ant is conscious?</p>
<p>Do you get the same reaction to that</p>
<p>or is that something you can understand?</p>
<p>I can understand ant,</p>
<p>I can understand an atom, a particle.</p>
<p>Plants?</p>
<p>Plant, so I&rsquo;m comfortable with living things on Earth</p>
<p>being conscious because there&rsquo;s some kind of agency</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re similar size to me</p>
<p>and they can be born and they can die.</p>
<p>And that is understandable intuitively.</p>
<p>Of course, you anthropomorphize,</p>
<p>you put yourself in the place of the plant,</p>
<p>but I can understand it.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m not like, I don&rsquo;t believe actually</p>
<p>that plants are conscious or that plants suffer,</p>
<p>but I can understand that kind of belief, that kind of idea.</p>
<p>How do you feel about robots?</p>
<p>Like the kind of robots we have now?</p>
<p>If I told you like that a Roomba</p>
<p>had some degree of consciousness</p>
<p>or some deep neural network.</p>
<p>I could understand that a Roomba has consciousness.</p>
<p>I just had spent all day at I, robot.</p>
<p>And I mean, I personally love robots</p>
<p>and I have a deep connection with robots.</p>
<p>So I can, I also probably anthropomorphize them.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something about the physical object.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a difference than a neural network,</p>
<p>a neural network running a software.</p>
<p>To me, the physical object,</p>
<p>something about the human experience</p>
<p>allows me to really see that physical object as an entity.</p>
<p>And if it moves and moves in a way that it,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a, like I didn&rsquo;t program it,</p>
<p>where it feels that it&rsquo;s acting based on its own perception.</p>
<p>And yes, self awareness and consciousness,</p>
<p>even if it&rsquo;s a Roomba,</p>
<p>then you start to assign it some agency, some consciousness.</p>
<p>So, but to say that panpsychism,</p>
<p>that consciousness is a fundamental property of reality</p>
<p>is a much bigger statement.</p>
<p>That it&rsquo;s like turtles all the way.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like every, it&rsquo;s, it doesn&rsquo;t end.</p>
<p>The whole thing is, so like how,</p>
<p>I know it&rsquo;s full of mystery,</p>
<p>but if you can linger on it,</p>
<p>like how would it, how do you think about reality</p>
<p>if consciousness is a fundamental part of its fabric?</p>
<p>The way you get there is from thinking,</p>
<p>can we explain consciousness given the existing fundamentals?</p>
<p>And then if you can&rsquo;t, as at least right now, it looks like,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;ve got to add something.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t follow that you have to add consciousness.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s another interesting possibility is,</p>
<p>well, we&rsquo;ll add something else.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s call it proto consciousness or X.</p>
<p>And then it turns out space, time, mass plus X</p>
<p>will somehow collectively give you the possibility</p>
<p>for consciousness.</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t rule out that view?</p>
<p>Either I call that pan proto psychism,</p>
<p>because maybe there&rsquo;s some other property,</p>
<p>proto consciousness at the bottom level.</p>
<p>And if you can&rsquo;t imagine there&rsquo;s actually</p>
<p>genuine consciousness at the bottom level,</p>
<p>I think we should be open to the idea</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s this other thing X.</p>
<p>Maybe we can&rsquo;t imagine that somehow gives you consciousness.</p>
<p>But if we are playing along with the idea</p>
<p>that there really is genuine consciousness</p>
<p>at the bottom level, of course,</p>
<p>this is going to be way out and speculative,</p>
<p>but at least in, say, if it was classical physics,</p>
<p>then we&rsquo;d have to, you&rsquo;d end up saying,</p>
<p>well, every little atom, every little,</p>
<p>with a bunch of particles in space time,</p>
<p>each of these particles has some kind of consciousness</p>
<p>whose structure mirrors maybe their physical properties,</p>
<p>like its mass, its charge, its velocity, and so on.</p>
<p>The structure of its consciousness</p>
<p>would roughly correspond to that.</p>
<p>And the physical interactions between particles,</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s this old worry about physics.</p>
<p>I mentioned this before in this issue</p>
<p>about the manifest image.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t really find out</p>
<p>about the intrinsic nature of things.</p>
<p>Physics tells us about how a particle relates</p>
<p>to other particles and interacts.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t tell us about what the particle is in itself.</p>
<p>That was Kant&rsquo;s thing in itself.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s a view.</p>
<p>The nature in itself of a particle is something mental.</p>
<p>A particle is actually a conscious,</p>
<p>a little conscious subject</p>
<p>with properties of its consciousness</p>
<p>that correspond to its physical properties.</p>
<p>The laws of physics are actually ultimately relating</p>
<p>these properties of conscious subjects.</p>
<p>So in this view, a Newtonian world</p>
<p>actually would be a vast collection</p>
<p>of little conscious subjects at the bottom level,</p>
<p>way, way simpler than we are without free will</p>
<p>or rationality or anything like that.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s what the universe would be like.</p>
<p>Now, of course, that&rsquo;s a vastly speculative view.</p>
<p>No particular reason to think it&rsquo;s correct.</p>
<p>Furthermore, non Newtonian physics,</p>
<p>say quantum mechanical wave function,</p>
<p>suddenly it starts to look different.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a vast collection of conscious subjects.</p>
<p>Maybe there&rsquo;s ultimately one big wave function</p>
<p>for the whole universe.</p>
<p>Corresponding to that might be something more</p>
<p>like a single conscious mind</p>
<p>whose structure corresponds</p>
<p>to the structure of the wave function.</p>
<p>People sometimes call this cosmo psychism.</p>
<p>And now, of course, we&rsquo;re in the realm</p>
<p>of extremely speculative philosophy.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no direct evidence for this,</p>
<p>but yeah, but if you want a picture</p>
<p>of what that universe would be like,</p>
<p>think, yeah, giant cosmic mind</p>
<p>with enough richness and structure among it</p>
<p>to replicate all the structure of physics.</p>
<p>I think therefore I am at the level of particles</p>
<p>and with quantum mechanics</p>
<p>at the level of the wave function.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of an exciting, beautiful possibility,</p>
<p>of course, way out of reach of physics currently.</p>
<p>It is interesting that some neuroscientists</p>
<p>are beginning to take panpsychism seriously,</p>
<p>that you find consciousness even in very simple systems.</p>
<p>So for example, the integrated information theory</p>
<p>of consciousness, a lot of neuroscientists</p>
<p>are taking seriously.</p>
<p>Actually, I just got this new book</p>
<p>by Christoph Koch just came in,</p>
<p>The Feeling of Life Itself,</p>
<p>why consciousness is widespread, but can&rsquo;t be computed.</p>
<p>He likes, he basically endorses a panpsychist view</p>
<p>where you get consciousness</p>
<p>with the degree of information processing</p>
<p>or integrated information processing in a simple,</p>
<p>in a system and even very, very simple systems,</p>
<p>like a couple of particles will have some degree of this.</p>
<p>So he ends up with some degree of consciousness</p>
<p>in all matter.</p>
<p>And the claim is that this theory</p>
<p>can actually explain a bunch of stuff</p>
<p>about the connection between the brain and consciousness.</p>
<p>Now, that&rsquo;s very controversial.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s very, very early days</p>
<p>in the science of consciousness.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting that it&rsquo;s not just philosophy</p>
<p>that might lead you in this direction,</p>
<p>but there are ways of thinking quasi scientifically</p>
<p>that lead you there too.</p>
<p>But maybe it&rsquo;s different than panpsychism.</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>
<p>So Alan Watts has this quote that I&rsquo;d like to ask you about.</p>
<p>The quote is, through our eyes,</p>
<p>the universe is perceiving itself.</p>
<p>Through our ears, the universe is listening</p>
<p>to its harmonies.</p>
<p>We are the witnesses through which the universe</p>
<p>becomes conscious of its glory, of its magnificence.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s not panpsychism.</p>
<p>Do you think that we are essentially the tools,</p>
<p>the senses the universe created to be conscious of itself?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an interesting idea.</p>
<p>Of course, if you went for the giant cosmic mind view,</p>
<p>then the universe was conscious all along.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t need us.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re just little components of the universal consciousness.</p>
<p>Likewise, if you believe in panpsychism,</p>
<p>then there was some little degree of consciousness</p>
<p>at the bottom level all along.</p>
<p>And we were just a more complex form of consciousness.</p>
<p>So I think maybe the quote you mentioned works better.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re not a panpsychist, you&rsquo;re not a cosmo psychist,</p>
<p>you think consciousness just exists</p>
<p>at this intermediate level.</p>
<p>And of course, that&rsquo;s the Orthodox view.</p>
<p>That you would say is the common view?</p>
<p>So is your own view with panpsychism a rare view?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s generally regarded certainly</p>
<p>as a speculative view held by a fairly small minority</p>
<p>of at least theorists, most philosophers</p>
<p>and most scientists who think about consciousness</p>
<p>are not panpsychists.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s been a bit of a movement in that direction</p>
<p>the last 10 years or so.</p>
<p>It seems to be quite popular,</p>
<p>especially among the younger generation,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s still very definitely a minority view.</p>
<p>Many people think it&rsquo;s totally batshit crazy</p>
<p>to use the technical term.</p>
<p>But the philosophical term.</p>
<p>So the Orthodox view, I think is still consciousness</p>
<p>is something that humans have</p>
<p>and some good number of nonhuman animals have,</p>
<p>and maybe AIs might have one day, but it&rsquo;s restricted.</p>
<p>On that view, then there was no consciousness</p>
<p>at the start of the universe.</p>
<p>There may be none at the end,</p>
<p>but it is this thing which happened at some point</p>
<p>in the history of the universe, consciousness developed.</p>
<p>And yes, that&rsquo;s a very amazing event on this view</p>
<p>because many people are inclined to think consciousness</p>
<p>is what somehow gives meaning to our lives.</p>
<p>Without consciousness, there&rsquo;d be no meaning,</p>
<p>no true value, no good versus bad and so on.</p>
<p>So with the advent of consciousness,</p>
<p>suddenly the universe went from meaningless</p>
<p>to somehow meaningful.</p>
<p>Why did this happen?</p>
<p>I guess the quote you mentioned was somehow,</p>
<p>this was somehow destined to happen</p>
<p>because the universe needed to have consciousness</p>
<p>within it to have value and have meaning.</p>
<p>And maybe you could combine that with a theistic view</p>
<p>or a teleological view.</p>
<p>The universe was inexorably evolving towards consciousness.</p>
<p>Actually, my colleague here at NYU, Tom Nagel,</p>
<p>wrote a book called Mind and Cosmos a few years ago</p>
<p>where he argued for this teleological view</p>
<p>of evolution toward consciousness,</p>
<p>saying this led the problems for Darwinism.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s got him on, this is very, very controversial.</p>
<p>Most people didn&rsquo;t agree.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t myself agree with this teleological view,</p>
<p>but it is at least a beautiful speculative view</p>
<p>of the cosmos.</p>
<p>What do you think people experience?</p>
<p>What do they seek when they believe in God</p>
<p>from this kind of perspective?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not an expert on thinking about God and religion.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not myself religious at all.</p>
<p>When people sort of pray, communicate with God,</p>
<p>which whatever form,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not speaking to sort of the practices</p>
<p>and the rituals of religion.</p>
<p>I mean the actual experience of that people</p>
<p>really have a deep connection with God in some cases.</p>
<p>What do you think that experience is?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so common, at least throughout the history</p>
<p>of civilization, that it seems like we seek that.</p>
<p>At the very least, it is an interesting</p>
<p>conscious experience that people have</p>
<p>when they experience religious awe or prayer and so on.</p>
<p>Neuroscientists have tried to examine</p>
<p>what bits of the brain are active and so on.</p>
<p>But yeah, there&rsquo;s this deeper question</p>
<p>of what are people looking for when they&rsquo;re doing this?</p>
<p>And like I said, I&rsquo;ve got no real expertise on this,</p>
<p>but it does seem that one thing people are after</p>
<p>is a sense of meaning and value,</p>
<p>a sense of connection to something greater than themselves</p>
<p>that will give their lives meaning and value.</p>
<p>And maybe the thought is if there is a God,</p>
<p>then God somehow is a universal consciousness</p>
<p>who has invested this universe with meaning</p>
<p>and somehow connection to God might give your life meaning.</p>
<p>I guess I can kind of see the attractions of that,</p>
<p>but it still makes me wonder why is it exactly</p>
<p>that a universal consciousness, God,</p>
<p>would be needed to give the world meaning?</p>
<p>If universal consciousness can give the world meaning,</p>
<p>why can&rsquo;t local consciousness give the world meaning too?</p>
<p>So I think my consciousness gives my world meaning.</p>
<p>Is the origin of meaning for your world.</p>
<p>Yeah, I experience things as good or bad,</p>
<p>happy, sad, interesting, important.</p>
<p>So my consciousness invests this world with meaning.</p>
<p>Without any consciousness,</p>
<p>maybe it would be a bleak, meaningless universe.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t see why I need someone else&rsquo;s consciousness</p>
<p>or even God&rsquo;s consciousness to give this universe meaning.</p>
<p>Here we are, local creatures</p>
<p>with our own subjective experiences.</p>
<p>I think we can give the universe meaning ourselves.</p>
<p>I mean, maybe to some people that feels inadequate.</p>
<p>Our own local consciousness is somehow too puny</p>
<p>and insignificant to invest any of this</p>
<p>with cosmic significance.</p>
<p>And maybe God gives you a sense of cosmic significance,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m just speculating here.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a really interesting idea</p>
<p>that consciousness is the thing that makes life meaningful.</p>
<p>If you could maybe just briefly explore that for a second.</p>
<p>So I suspect just from listening to you now,</p>
<p>you mean in an almost trivial sense,</p>
<p>just the day to day experiences of life have,</p>
<p>because of you attach identity to it,</p>
<p>they become, I guess I wanna ask something</p>
<p>I would always wanted to ask</p>
<p>a legit world renowned philosopher.</p>
<p>What is the meaning of life?</p>
<p>So I suspect you don&rsquo;t mean consciousness gives</p>
<p>any kind of greater meaning to it all.</p>
<p>And more to day to day.</p>
<p>But is there a greater meaning to it all?</p>
<p>I think life has meaning for us because we are conscious.</p>
<p>So without consciousness, no meaning,</p>
<p>consciousness invests our life with meaning.</p>
<p>So consciousness is the source of the meaning of life,</p>
<p>but I wouldn&rsquo;t say consciousness itself</p>
<p>is the meaning of life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say what&rsquo;s meaningful in life</p>
<p>is basically what we find meaningful,</p>
<p>what we experience as meaningful.</p>
<p>So if you find meaning and fulfillment and value</p>
<p>in say, intellectual work, like understanding,</p>
<p>then that&rsquo;s a very significant part</p>
<p>of the meaning of life for you.</p>
<p>If you find that in social connections</p>
<p>or in raising a family,</p>
<p>then that&rsquo;s the meaning of life for you.</p>
<p>The meaning kind of comes from what you value</p>
<p>as a conscious creature.</p>
<p>So I think there&rsquo;s no, on this view,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no universal solution.</p>
<p>No universal answer to the question,</p>
<p>what is the meaning of life?</p>
<p>The meaning of life is where you find it</p>
<p>as a conscious creature,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s consciousness that somehow makes value possible.</p>
<p>Experiencing some things as good or as bad</p>
<p>or as meaningful,</p>
<p>something comes from within consciousness.</p>
<p>So you think consciousness is a crucial component,</p>
<p>ingredient of assigning value to things?</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s kind of a fairly strong intuition</p>
<p>that without consciousness,</p>
<p>there wouldn&rsquo;t really be any value</p>
<p>if we just had a purely universe of unconscious creatures.</p>
<p>Would anything be better or worse than anything else?</p>
<p>Certainly when it comes to ethical dilemmas,</p>
<p>you know about the old trolley problem.</p>
<p>Do you kill one person</p>
<p>or do you switch to the other track to kill five?</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;ve got a variant on this,</p>
<p>the zombie trolley problem,</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s a one conscious being on one track</p>
<p>and five humanoid zombies.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s make them robots who are not conscious</p>
<p>on the other track.</p>
<p>Do you, given that choice,</p>
<p>do you kill the one conscious being</p>
<p>or the five unconscious robots?</p>
<p>Most people have a fairly clear intuition here.</p>
<p>Kill the unconscious beings</p>
<p>because they basically, they don&rsquo;t have a meaningful life.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not really persons, conscious beings at all.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have good intuition</p>
<p>about something like an unconscious being.</p>
<p>So in philosophical terms, you referred to as a zombie.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a useful thought experiment construction</p>
<p>in philosophical terms, but we don&rsquo;t yet have them.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s kind of what we may be able to create with robots.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t necessarily know what that even means.</p>
<p>Yeah, they&rsquo;re merely hypothetical.</p>
<p>For now, they&rsquo;re just a thought experiment.</p>
<p>They may never be possible.</p>
<p>I mean, the extreme case of a zombie</p>
<p>is a being which is physically, functionally,</p>
<p>behaviorally identical to me, but not conscious.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a mere,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that could ever be built in this universe.</p>
<p>The question is just could we,</p>
<p>does that hypothetically make sense?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s kind of a useful contrast class</p>
<p>to raise questions like, why aren&rsquo;t we zombies?</p>
<p>How does it come about that we&rsquo;re conscious?</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re not like that.</p>
<p>But there are less extreme versions of this like robots,</p>
<p>which are maybe not physically identical to us,</p>
<p>maybe not even functionally identical to us.</p>
<p>Maybe they&rsquo;ve got a different architecture,</p>
<p>but they can do a lot of sophisticated things,</p>
<p>maybe carry on a conversation, but they&rsquo;re not conscious.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not so far out.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got simple computer systems,</p>
<p>at least tending in that direction now.</p>
<p>And presumably this is gonna get more and more sophisticated</p>
<p>over years to come where we may have some pretty,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s at least quite straightforward to conceive</p>
<p>of some pretty sophisticated robot systems</p>
<p>that can use language and be fairly high functioning</p>
<p>without consciousness at all.</p>
<p>Then I stipulate that.</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;ve caused, there&rsquo;s this tricky question</p>
<p>of how you would know whether they&rsquo;re conscious.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s say we&rsquo;ve somehow solved that.</p>
<p>And we know that these high functioning robots</p>
<p>aren&rsquo;t conscious.</p>
<p>Then the question is, do they have moral status?</p>
<p>Does it matter how we treat them?</p>
<p>What does moral status mean, sir?</p>
<p>Basically it&rsquo;s that question.</p>
<p>Can they suffer?</p>
<p>Does it matter how we treat them?</p>
<p>For example, if I mistreat this glass, this cup</p>
<p>by shattering it, then that&rsquo;s bad.</p>
<p>Why is it bad though?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna make a mess.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna be annoying for me and my partner.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s not bad for the cup.</p>
<p>No one would say the cup itself has moral status.</p>
<p>Hey, you hurt the cup and that&rsquo;s doing it a moral harm.</p>
<p>Likewise, plants, well, again, if they&rsquo;re not conscious,</p>
<p>most people think by uprooting a plant,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not harming it.</p>
<p>But if a being is conscious on the other hand,</p>
<p>then you are harming it.</p>
<p>So Siri, or I dare not say the name of Alexa.</p>
<p>Anyway, so we don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;re morally harming Alexa</p>
<p>by turning her off or disconnecting her</p>
<p>or even destroying her, whether it&rsquo;s the system</p>
<p>or the underlying software system,</p>
<p>because we don&rsquo;t really think she&rsquo;s conscious.</p>
<p>On the other hand, you move to like the disembodied being</p>
<p>in the movie, her, Samantha,</p>
<p>I guess she was kind of presented as conscious.</p>
<p>And then if you destroyed her,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d certainly be committing a serious harm.</p>
<p>So I think our strong sense is if a being is conscious</p>
<p>and can undergo subjective experiences,</p>
<p>then it matters morally how we treat them.</p>
<p>So if a robot is conscious, it matters,</p>
<p>but if a robot is not conscious,</p>
<p>then they&rsquo;re basically just meat or a machine</p>
<p>and it doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>So I think at least maybe how we think about this stuff</p>
<p>is fundamentally wrong,</p>
<p>but I think a lot of people</p>
<p>who think about this stuff seriously,</p>
<p>including people who think about,</p>
<p>say the moral treatment of animals and so on,</p>
<p>come to the view that consciousness</p>
<p>is ultimately kind of the line between systems</p>
<p>that where we have to take them into account</p>
<p>and thinking morally about how we act</p>
<p>and systems for which we don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And I think I&rsquo;ve seen you the writer talk about</p>
<p>the demonstration of consciousness from a system like that,</p>
<p>from a system like Alexa or a conversational agent</p>
<p>that what you would be looking for</p>
<p>is kind of at the very basic level</p>
<p>for the system to have an awareness</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m just a program</p>
<p>and yet, why do I experience this?</p>
<p>Or not to have that experience,</p>
<p>but to communicate that to you.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what us humans would sound like.</p>
<p>If you all of a sudden woke up one day,</p>
<p>like Kafka, right, in a body of a bug or something,</p>
<p>but in a computer, you all of a sudden realized</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have a body</p>
<p>and yet you were feeling what you were feeling,</p>
<p>you would probably say those kinds of things.</p>
<p>So do you think a system essentially becomes conscious</p>
<p>by convincing us that it&rsquo;s conscious</p>
<p>through the words that I just mentioned?</p>
<p>So by being confused about the fact</p>
<p>that why am I having these experiences?</p>
<p>So basically.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think this is what makes you conscious,</p>
<p>but I do think being puzzled about consciousness</p>
<p>is a very good sign that a system is conscious.</p>
<p>So if I encountered a robot</p>
<p>that actually seemed to be genuinely puzzled</p>
<p>by its own mental states</p>
<p>and saying, yeah, I have all these weird experiences</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t see how to explain them.</p>
<p>I know I&rsquo;m just a set of silicon circuits,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t see how that would give you my consciousness.</p>
<p>I would at least take that as some evidence</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s some consciousness going on there.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think a system needs to be puzzled</p>
<p>about consciousness to be conscious.</p>
<p>Many people aren&rsquo;t puzzled by their consciousness.</p>
<p>Animals don&rsquo;t seem to be puzzled at all.</p>
<p>I still think they&rsquo;re conscious.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s a requirement on consciousness,</p>
<p>but I do think if we&rsquo;re looking for signs</p>
<p>for consciousness, say in AI systems,</p>
<p>one of the things that will help convince me</p>
<p>that an AI system is conscious is if it shows signs of,</p>
<p>if it shows signs of introspectively recognizing something</p>
<p>like consciousness and finding this philosophically puzzling</p>
<p>in the way that we do.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s such an interesting thought, though,</p>
<p>because a lot of people sort of would,</p>
<p>at the Shao level, criticize the Turing test for language.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s essentially what I heard Dan Dennett</p>
<p>criticize it in this kind of way,</p>
<p>which is it really puts a lot of emphasis on lying.</p>
<p>Yeah, and being able to imitate</p>
<p>human beings, yeah, there&rsquo;s this cartoon</p>
<p>of the AI system studying for the Turing test.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gotta read this book called Talk Like a Human.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, man, why do I have to waste my time</p>
<p>learning how to imitate humans?</p>
<p>Maybe the AI system is gonna be way beyond</p>
<p>the hard problem of consciousness,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s gonna be just like,</p>
<p>why do I need to waste my time pretending</p>
<p>that I recognize the hard problem of consciousness</p>
<p>in order for people to recognize me as conscious?</p>
<p>Yeah, it just feels like, I guess the question is,</p>
<p>do you think we can ever really create</p>
<p>a test for consciousness?</p>
<p>Because it feels like we&rsquo;re very human centric,</p>
<p>and so the only way we would be convinced</p>
<p>that something is conscious is basically</p>
<p>the thing demonstrates the illusion of consciousness,</p>
<p>that we can never really know whether it&rsquo;s conscious or not,</p>
<p>and in fact, that almost feels like it doesn&rsquo;t matter then,</p>
<p>or does it still matter to you that something is conscious</p>
<p>or it demonstrates consciousness?</p>
<p>You still see that fundamental distinction.</p>
<p>I think to a lot of people,</p>
<p>whether a system is conscious or not</p>
<p>matters hugely for many things,</p>
<p>like how we treat it, can it suffer, and so on,</p>
<p>but still, that leaves open the question,</p>
<p>how can we ever know?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s true that it&rsquo;s awfully hard</p>
<p>to see how we can know for sure</p>
<p>whether a system is conscious.</p>
<p>I suspect that sociologically,</p>
<p>the thing that&rsquo;s gonna convince us</p>
<p>that a system is conscious is, in part,</p>
<p>things like social interaction, conversation, and so on,</p>
<p>where they seem to be conscious,</p>
<p>they talk about their conscious states</p>
<p>or just talk about being happy or sad</p>
<p>or finding things meaningful or being in pain.</p>
<p>That will tend to convince us if we don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>if a system genuinely seems to be conscious,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t treat it as such,</p>
<p>eventually it&rsquo;s gonna seem like a strange form</p>
<p>of racism or speciesism or somehow,</p>
<p>not to acknowledge them as conscious.</p>
<p>I truly believe that, by the way.</p>
<p>I believe that there is going to be</p>
<p>something akin to the Civil Rights Movement,</p>
<p>but for robots.</p>
<p>I think the moment you have a Roomba say,</p>
<p>please don&rsquo;t kick me, that hurts, just say it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I think that will fundamentally change</p>
<p>the fabric of our society.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re probably right,</p>
<p>although it&rsquo;s gonna be very tricky</p>
<p>because, just say we&rsquo;ve got the technology</p>
<p>where these conscious beings can just be created</p>
<p>and multiplied by the thousands by flicking a switch.</p>
<p>The legal status is gonna be different,</p>
<p>but ultimately their moral status ought to be the same,</p>
<p>and yeah, the civil rights issue is gonna be a huge mess.</p>
<p>So if one day somebody clones you,</p>
<p>another very real possibility.</p>
<p>In fact, I find the conversation between</p>
<p>two copies of David Chalmers quite interesting.</p>
<p>Very thought.</p>
<p>Who is this idiot?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not making any sense.</p>
<p>So what, do you think he would be conscious?</p>
<p>I do think he would be conscious.</p>
<p>I do think in some sense,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure it would be me,</p>
<p>there would be two different beings at this point.</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;d both be conscious</p>
<p>and they both have many of the same mental properties.</p>
<p>I think they both in a way have the same moral status.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d be wrong to hurt either of them</p>
<p>or to kill them and so on.</p>
<p>Still, there&rsquo;s some sense in which probably</p>
<p>their legal status would have to be different.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m the original and that one&rsquo;s just a clone,</p>
<p>then creating a clone of me,</p>
<p>presumably the clone doesn&rsquo;t, for example,</p>
<p>automatically own the stuff that I own</p>
<p>or I&rsquo;ve got a certain connect,</p>
<p>the things that the people I interact with,</p>
<p>my family, my partner and so on,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna somehow be connected to them</p>
<p>in a way in which the clone isn&rsquo;t, so.</p>
<p>Because you came slightly first?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Because a clone would argue that they have</p>
<p>really as much of a connection.</p>
<p>They have all the memories of that connection.</p>
<p>Then a way you might say it&rsquo;s kind of unfair</p>
<p>to discriminate against them,</p>
<p>but say you&rsquo;ve got an apartment</p>
<p>that only one person can live in</p>
<p>or a partner who only one person can be with.</p>
<p>But why should it be you, the original?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an interesting philosophical question,</p>
<p>but you might say because I actually have this history,</p>
<p>if I am the same person as the one that came before</p>
<p>and the clone is not,</p>
<p>then I have this history that the clone doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Of course, there&rsquo;s also the question,</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t the clone the same person too?</p>
<p>This is a question about personal identity.</p>
<p>If I continue and I create a clone over there,</p>
<p>I wanna say this one is me and this one is someone else.</p>
<p>But you could take the view that a clone is equally me.</p>
<p>Of course, in a movie like Star Trek</p>
<p>where they have a teletransporter</p>
<p>basically creates clones all the time.</p>
<p>They treat the clones as if they&rsquo;re the original person.</p>
<p>Of course, they destroy the original body in Star Trek.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s only one left around</p>
<p>and only very occasionally do things go wrong</p>
<p>and you get two copies of Captain Kirk.</p>
<p>But somehow our legal system at the very least</p>
<p>is gonna have to sort out some of these issues</p>
<p>and that maybe that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s moral</p>
<p>and what&rsquo;s legally acceptable are gonna come apart.</p>
<p>What question would you ask a clone of yourself?</p>
<p>Is there something useful you can find out from him</p>
<p>about the fundamentals of consciousness even?</p>
<p>I mean, kind of in principle,</p>
<p>I know that if it&rsquo;s a perfect clone,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna behave just like me.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;m gonna be able to,</p>
<p>I can discover whether it&rsquo;s a perfect clone</p>
<p>by seeing whether it answers like me.</p>
<p>But otherwise I know what I&rsquo;m gonna find is a being</p>
<p>which is just like me,</p>
<p>except that it&rsquo;s just undergone this great shock</p>
<p>of discovering that it&rsquo;s a clone.</p>
<p>So just say you woke me up tomorrow and said,</p>
<p>hey Dave, sorry to tell you this,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re actually the clone</p>
<p>and you provided me really convincing evidence,</p>
<p>showed me the film of my being cloned</p>
<p>and then all wrapped in here being here and waking up.</p>
<p>So you proved to me I&rsquo;m a clone,</p>
<p>well, yeah, okay, I would find that shocking</p>
<p>and who knows how I would react to this.</p>
<p>So maybe by talking to the clone,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d find something about my own psychology</p>
<p>that I can&rsquo;t find out so easily,</p>
<p>like how I&rsquo;d react upon discovering that I&rsquo;m a clone.</p>
<p>I could certainly ask the clone if it&rsquo;s conscious</p>
<p>and what his consciousness is like and so on,</p>
<p>but I guess I kind of know if it&rsquo;s a perfect clone,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna behave roughly like me.</p>
<p>Of course, at the beginning,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;ll be a question</p>
<p>about whether a perfect clone is possible.</p>
<p>So I may wanna ask it lots of questions</p>
<p>to see if it&rsquo;s consciousness</p>
<p>and the way it talks about its consciousness</p>
<p>and the way it reacts to things in general is likely.</p>
<p>And that will occupy us for a while.</p>
<p>So basic unit testing on the early models.</p>
<p>So if it&rsquo;s a perfect clone,</p>
<p>you say that it&rsquo;s gonna behave exactly like you.</p>
<p>So that takes us to free will.</p>
<p>Is there free will?</p>
<p>Are we able to make decisions that are not predetermined</p>
<p>from the initial conditions of the universe?</p>
<p>You know, philosophers do this annoying thing</p>
<p>of saying it depends what you mean.</p>
<p>So in this case, yeah, it really depends on what you mean,</p>
<p>by free will.</p>
<p>If you mean something which was not determined in advance,</p>
<p>could never have been determined,</p>
<p>then I don&rsquo;t know we have free will.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s quantum mechanics</p>
<p>and who&rsquo;s to say if that opens up some room,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m not sure we have free will in that sense.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m also not sure that&rsquo;s the kind of free will</p>
<p>that really matters.</p>
<p>You know, what matters to us</p>
<p>is being able to do what we want</p>
<p>and to create our own futures.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got this distinction between having our lives</p>
<p>be under our control and under someone else&rsquo;s control.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got the sense of actions that we are responsible for</p>
<p>versus ones that we&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>I think you can make those distinctions</p>
<p>even in a deterministic universe.</p>
<p>And this is what people call the compatibilist view</p>
<p>of free will, where it&rsquo;s compatible with determinism.</p>
<p>So I think for many purposes,</p>
<p>the kind of free will that matters</p>
<p>is something we can have in a deterministic universe.</p>
<p>And I can&rsquo;t see any reason in principle</p>
<p>why an AI system couldn&rsquo;t have free will of that kind.</p>
<p>If you mean super duper free will,</p>
<p>the ability to violate the laws of physics</p>
<p>and doing things that in principle could not be predicted.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, maybe no one has that kind of free will.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the connection between the reality of free will</p>
<p>and the experience of it,</p>
<p>the subjective experience in your view?</p>
<p>So how does consciousness connect</p>
<p>to the reality and the experience of free will?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s certainly true that when we make decisions</p>
<p>and when we choose and so on,</p>
<p>we feel like we have an open future.</p>
<p>Feel like I could do this, I could go into philosophy</p>
<p>or I could go into math, I could go to a movie tonight,</p>
<p>I could go to a restaurant.</p>
<p>So we experience these things as if the future is open.</p>
<p>And maybe we experience ourselves</p>
<p>as exerting a kind of effect on the future</p>
<p>that somehow picking out one path</p>
<p>from many paths were previously open.</p>
<p>And you might think that actually</p>
<p>if we&rsquo;re in a deterministic universe,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a sense of which objectively</p>
<p>those paths weren&rsquo;t really open all along,</p>
<p>but subjectively they were open.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, I think that&rsquo;s what really matters</p>
<p>in making a decisions where our experience</p>
<p>of making a decision is choosing a path for ourselves.</p>
<p>I mean, in general, our introspective models of the mind,</p>
<p>I think are generally very distorted representations</p>
<p>of the mind.</p>
<p>So it may well be that our experience of ourself</p>
<p>in making a decision, our experience of what&rsquo;s going on</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t terribly well mirror what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>I mean, maybe there are antecedents in the brain</p>
<p>way before anything came into consciousness</p>
<p>and so on.</p>
<p>Those aren&rsquo;t represented in our introspective model.</p>
<p>So in general, our experience of perception,</p>
<p>so I experience a perceptual image of the external world.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a terribly good model of what&rsquo;s actually going on</p>
<p>in my visual cortex and so on,</p>
<p>which has all these layers and so on.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just one little snapshot of one bit of that.</p>
<p>So in general, introspective models</p>
<p>are very over oversimplified.</p>
<p>And it wouldn&rsquo;t be surprising</p>
<p>if that was true of free will as well.</p>
<p>This also incidentally can be applied to consciousness itself.</p>
<p>There is this very interesting view</p>
<p>that consciousness itself is an introspective illusion.</p>
<p>In fact, we&rsquo;re not conscious,</p>
<p>but the brain just has these introspective models of itself</p>
<p>or oversimplifies everything and represents itself</p>
<p>as having these special properties of consciousness.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a really simple way to kind of keep track of itself</p>
<p>and so on.</p>
<p>And then on the illusionist view,</p>
<p>yeah, that&rsquo;s just an illusion.</p>
<p>I find this view, when I find it implausible,</p>
<p>I do find it very attractive in some ways,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s easy to tell some story</p>
<p>about how the brain would create introspective models</p>
<p>of its own consciousness, of its own free will</p>
<p>as a way of simplifying itself.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s a similar way when we perceive</p>
<p>the external world, we perceive it as having these colors</p>
<p>that maybe it doesn&rsquo;t really have,</p>
<p>but of course that&rsquo;s a really useful way</p>
<p>of keeping tracks, of keeping track.</p>
<p>Did you say that you find it not very plausible?</p>
<p>Because I find it both plausible</p>
<p>and attractive in some sense,</p>
<p>because I mean, that kind of view</p>
<p>is one that has the minimum amount of mystery around it.</p>
<p>You can kind of understand that kind of view.</p>
<p>Everything else says we don&rsquo;t understand</p>
<p>so much of this picture.</p>
<p>No, it is very attractive, I recently wrote an article</p>
<p>about this kind of issue called</p>
<p>the meta problem of consciousness.</p>
<p>The hard problem is how does a brain</p>
<p>give you consciousness?</p>
<p>The meta problem is why are we puzzled</p>
<p>by the hard problem of consciousness?</p>
<p>Because being puzzled by it,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s ultimately a bit of behavior.</p>
<p>We might be able to explain that bit of behavior</p>
<p>as one of the easy problems, consciousness.</p>
<p>So maybe there&rsquo;ll be some computational model</p>
<p>that explains why we&rsquo;re puzzled by consciousness.</p>
<p>The meta problem has come up with that model.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve been thinking about that a lot lately.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some interesting stories you can tell</p>
<p>about why the right kind of computational system</p>
<p>might develop these introspective models of itself</p>
<p>that attributed itself, these special properties.</p>
<p>So that meta problem is a research program for everyone.</p>
<p>And then if you&rsquo;ve got attraction</p>
<p>to sort of simple views, desert landscapes and so on,</p>
<p>then you can go all the way</p>
<p>with what people call illusionism</p>
<p>and say, in fact, consciousness itself is not real.</p>
<p>What is real is just these introspective models</p>
<p>we have that tell us that we&rsquo;re conscious.</p>
<p>So the view is very simple, very attractive, very powerful.</p>
<p>The trouble is, of course, it has to say</p>
<p>that deep down, consciousness is not real.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not actually experiencing right now.</p>
<p>And it looks like it&rsquo;s just contradicting</p>
<p>a fundamental datum of our existence.</p>
<p>And this is why most people find this view crazy.</p>
<p>Just as they find panpsychism crazy in one way,</p>
<p>people find illusionism crazy in another way.</p>
<p>But I mean, so yes, it has to deny</p>
<p>this fundamental datum of our existence.</p>
<p>Now, that makes the view sort of frankly unbelievable</p>
<p>for most people.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the view developed right</p>
<p>might be able to explain why we find it unbelievable.</p>
<p>Because these models are so deeply hardwired into our head.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re all integrated.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t escape the illusion.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a crazy possibility.</p>
<p>Is it possible that the entirety of the universe,</p>
<p>our planet, all the people in New York,</p>
<p>all the organisms on our planet,</p>
<p>including me here today, are not real in that sense?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all part of an illusion inside of Dave Chalmers&rsquo;s head.</p>
<p>I think all this could be a simulation.</p>
<p>No, but not just a simulation.</p>
<p>Because the simulation kind of is outside of you.</p>
<p>A dream?</p>
<p>What if it&rsquo;s all an illusion?</p>
<p>Yes, a dream that you&rsquo;re experiencing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s all in your mind, right?</p>
<p>Is that, can you take illusionism that far?</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s illusionism about the external world</p>
<p>and illusionism about consciousness.</p>
<p>And these might go in different.</p>
<p>Illusionism about the external world</p>
<p>kind of takes you back to Descartes.</p>
<p>And yeah, could all this be produced by an evil demon?</p>
<p>Descartes himself also had the dream argument.</p>
<p>He said, how do you know you&rsquo;re not dreaming right now?</p>
<p>How do you know this is not an amazing dream?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s at least a possibility that yeah,</p>
<p>this could be some super duper complex dream</p>
<p>in the next universe up.</p>
<p>I guess though, my attitude is that just as,</p>
<p>when Descartes thought that if the evil demon was doing it,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not real.</p>
<p>A lot of people these days say if a simulation is doing it,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not real.</p>
<p>As I was saying before, I think even if it&rsquo;s a simulation,</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t stop this from being real.</p>
<p>It just tells us what the world is made of.</p>
<p>Likewise, if it&rsquo;s a dream,</p>
<p>it could turn out that all this is like my dream</p>
<p>created by my brain in the next universe up.</p>
<p>My own view is that wouldn&rsquo;t stop this physical world</p>
<p>from being real.</p>
<p>It would turn out this cup at the most fundamental level</p>
<p>was made of a bit of say my consciousness</p>
<p>in the dreaming mind at the next level up.</p>
<p>Maybe that would give you a kind of weird kind of panpsychism</p>
<p>about reality, but it wouldn&rsquo;t show that the cup isn&rsquo;t real.</p>
<p>It would just tell us it&rsquo;s ultimately made of processes</p>
<p>in my dreaming mind.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;d resist the idea that if the physical world is a dream,</p>
<p>then it&rsquo;s an illusion.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>By the way, perhaps you have an interesting thought</p>
<p>about it.</p>
<p>Why is Descartes demon or genius considered evil?</p>
<p>Why couldn&rsquo;t have been a benevolent one</p>
<p>that had the same powers?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, Descartes called it the malign genie,</p>
<p>the evil genie or evil genius.</p>
<p>Malign, I guess was the word.</p>
<p>But yeah, it&rsquo;s an interesting question.</p>
<p>I mean, a later philosophy, Barclay said,</p>
<p>no, in fact, all this is done by God.</p>
<p>God actually supplies you all of these perceptions</p>
<p>and ideas and that&rsquo;s how physical reality is sustained.</p>
<p>And interestingly, Barclay&rsquo;s God is doing something</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t look so different</p>
<p>from what Descartes evil demon was doing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that Descartes thought it was deception</p>
<p>and Barclay thought it was not.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m actually more sympathetic to Barclay here.</p>
<p>Yeah, this evil demon may be trying to deceive you,</p>
<p>but I think, okay, well, the evil demon</p>
<p>may just be working under a false philosophical theory.</p>
<p>It thinks it&rsquo;s deceiving you, it&rsquo;s wrong.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like there&rsquo;s machines in the matrix.</p>
<p>They thought they were deceiving you</p>
<p>that all this stuff is real.</p>
<p>I think, no, if we&rsquo;re in a matrix, it&rsquo;s all still real.</p>
<p>Yeah, the philosopher O.K. Bousma had a nice story</p>
<p>about this about 50 years ago, about Descartes evil demon,</p>
<p>where he said this demon spends all its time</p>
<p>trying to fool people, but fails</p>
<p>because somehow all the demon ends up doing</p>
<p>is constructing realities for people.</p>
<p>So yeah, I think that maybe it&rsquo;s a very natural</p>
<p>to take this view that if we&rsquo;re in a simulation</p>
<p>or evil demon scenario or something,</p>
<p>then none of this is real.</p>
<p>But I think it may be ultimately a philosophical mistake,</p>
<p>especially if you take on board sort of the view of reality</p>
<p>where what matters to reality is really its structure,</p>
<p>something like its mathematical structure and so on,</p>
<p>which seems to be the view that a lot of people take</p>
<p>from contemporary physics.</p>
<p>And it looks like you can find</p>
<p>all that mathematical structure in a simulation,</p>
<p>maybe even in a dream and so on.</p>
<p>So as long as that structure is real,</p>
<p>I would say that&rsquo;s enough for the physical world to be real.</p>
<p>Yeah, the physical world may turn out</p>
<p>to be somewhat more intangible than we had thought</p>
<p>and have a surprising nature of it.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re already gotten very used to that from modern science.</p>
<p>See, you&rsquo;ve kind of alluded</p>
<p>that you don&rsquo;t have to have consciousness</p>
<p>for high levels of intelligence,</p>
<p>but to create truly general intelligence systems,</p>
<p>AGI systems at human level intelligence</p>
<p>and perhaps super human level intelligence,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve talked about that you feel like</p>
<p>that kind of thing might be very far away,</p>
<p>but nevertheless, when we reached that point,</p>
<p>do you think consciousness</p>
<p>from an engineering perspective is needed</p>
<p>or at least highly beneficial for creating an AGI system?</p>
<p>Yeah, no one knows what consciousness is for functionally.</p>
<p>So right now there&rsquo;s no specific thing we can point to</p>
<p>and say, you need consciousness for that.</p>
<p>So my inclination is to believe</p>
<p>that in principle AGI is possible.</p>
<p>The very least I don&rsquo;t see why</p>
<p>someone couldn&rsquo;t simulate a brain,</p>
<p>ultimately have a computational system</p>
<p>that produces all of our behavior.</p>
<p>And if that&rsquo;s possible,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure vastly many other computational systems</p>
<p>of equal or greater sophistication are possible</p>
<p>with all of our cognitive functions and more.</p>
<p>My inclination is to think that</p>
<p>once you&rsquo;ve got all these cognitive functions,</p>
<p>perception, attention, reasoning,</p>
<p>introspection, language, emotion, and so on,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very likely you&rsquo;ll have consciousness as well.</p>
<p>So at least it&rsquo;s very hard for me to see</p>
<p>how you&rsquo;d have a system that had all those things</p>
<p>while bypassing somehow conscious.</p>
<p>So just naturally it&rsquo;s integrated quite naturally.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of overlap about the kind of function</p>
<p>that required to achieve each of those things</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s, so you can&rsquo;t disentangle them</p>
<p>even when you&rsquo;re recreating.</p>
<p>It seems to, at least in us,</p>
<p>but we don&rsquo;t know what the causal role of consciousness</p>
<p>in the physical world, what it does.</p>
<p>I mean, just say it turns out</p>
<p>consciousness does something very specific</p>
<p>in the physical world like collapsing wave functions</p>
<p>as on one common interpretation of quantum mechanics.</p>
<p>Then ultimately we might find some place</p>
<p>where it actually makes a difference</p>
<p>and we could say, ah,</p>
<p>here is where in collapsing wave functions</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s driving the behavior of a system.</p>
<p>And maybe it could even turn out that for AGI,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d need something playing that.</p>
<p>I mean, if you wanted to connect this to free will,</p>
<p>some people think consciousness collapsing wave functions,</p>
<p>that would be how the conscious mind exerts effect</p>
<p>on the physical world and exerts its free will.</p>
<p>And maybe it could turn out that any AGI</p>
<p>that didn&rsquo;t utilize that mechanism would be limited</p>
<p>in the kinds of functionality that it had.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t myself find that plausible.</p>
<p>I think probably that functionality could be simulated.</p>
<p>But you can imagine once we had a very specific idea</p>
<p>about the role of consciousness in the physical world,</p>
<p>this would have some impact on the capacity of AGI&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>And if it was a role that could not be duplicated elsewhere,</p>
<p>then we&rsquo;d have to find some way to either</p>
<p>get consciousness in the system to play that role</p>
<p>or to simulate it.</p>
<p>If we can isolate a particular role to consciousness,</p>
<p>of course, it seems like an incredibly difficult thing.</p>
<p>Do you have worries about existential threats</p>
<p>of conscious intelligent beings that are not us?</p>
<p>So certainly, I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re worried about us</p>
<p>from an existential threat perspective,</p>
<p>but outside of us, AI systems.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a couple of different kinds</p>
<p>of existential threats here.</p>
<p>One is an existential threat to consciousness generally.</p>
<p>I mean, yes, I care about humans</p>
<p>and the survival of humans and so on,</p>
<p>but just say it turns out that eventually we&rsquo;re replaced</p>
<p>by some artificial beings that aren&rsquo;t humans,</p>
<p>but are somehow our successors.</p>
<p>They still have good lives.</p>
<p>They still do interesting and wonderful things</p>
<p>with the universe.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s not so bad.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just our successors.</p>
<p>We were one stage in evolution.</p>
<p>Something different, maybe better came next.</p>
<p>If on the other hand, all of consciousness was wiped out,</p>
<p>that would be a very serious moral disaster.</p>
<p>One way that could happen is by all intelligent life</p>
<p>being wiped out.</p>
<p>And many people think that, yeah,</p>
<p>once you get to humans and AIs and amazing sophistication</p>
<p>where everyone has got the ability to create weapons</p>
<p>that can destroy the whole universe just by pressing a button,</p>
<p>then maybe it&rsquo;s inevitable all intelligent life will die out.</p>
<p>That would certainly be a disaster.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve got to think very hard about how to avoid that.</p>
<p>But yeah, another interesting kind of disaster</p>
<p>is that maybe intelligent life is not wiped out,</p>
<p>but all consciousness is wiped out.</p>
<p>So just say your thought,</p>
<p>unlike what I was saying a moment ago,</p>
<p>that there are two different kinds of intelligent systems,</p>
<p>some which are conscious and some which are not.</p>
<p>And just say it turns out that we create AGI</p>
<p>with a high degree of intelligence,</p>
<p>meaning high degree of sophistication and its behavior,</p>
<p>but with no consciousness at all.</p>
<p>That AGI could take over the world maybe,</p>
<p>but then there&rsquo;d be no consciousness in this world.</p>
<p>This would be a world of zombies.</p>
<p>Some people have called this the zombie apocalypse</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s an apocalypse for consciousness.</p>
<p>Consciousness is gone.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve merely got this super intelligent,</p>
<p>nonconscious robots.</p>
<p>And I would say that&rsquo;s a moral disaster in the same way,</p>
<p>in almost the same way that the world</p>
<p>with no intelligent life is a moral disaster.</p>
<p>All value and meaning may be gone from that world.</p>
<p>So these are both threats to watch out for.</p>
<p>Now, my own view is if you get super intelligence,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re almost certainly gonna bring consciousness with it.</p>
<p>So I hope that&rsquo;s not gonna happen.</p>
<p>But of course, I don&rsquo;t understand consciousness.</p>
<p>No one understands consciousness.</p>
<p>This is one reason for,</p>
<p>this is one reason at least among many</p>
<p>for thinking very seriously about consciousness</p>
<p>and thinking about the kind of future</p>
<p>we want to create in a world with humans and or AIs.</p>
<p>How do you feel about the possibility</p>
<p>if consciousness so naturally does come with AGI systems</p>
<p>that we are just a step in the evolution?</p>
<p>That we will be just something, a blimp on the record</p>
<p>that&rsquo;ll be studied in books</p>
<p>by the AGI systems centuries from now?</p>
<p>I mean, I think I&rsquo;d probably be okay with that,</p>
<p>especially if somehow humans are continuous with AGI.</p>
<p>I mean, I think something like this is inevitable.</p>
<p>The very least humans are gonna be transformed.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna be augmented by technology.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s already happening in all kinds of ways.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna be transformed by technology</p>
<p>where our brains are gonna be uploaded</p>
<p>and computationally enhanced.</p>
<p>And eventually that line between what&rsquo;s a human</p>
<p>and what&rsquo;s an AI may be kind of hard to draw.</p>
<p>How much does it matter, for example,</p>
<p>that some future being a thousand years from now</p>
<p>that somehow descended from us actually still has biology?</p>
<p>I think it would be nice if you kind of point</p>
<p>to its cognitive system, point to some parts</p>
<p>that had some roots in us and trace a continuous line there.</p>
<p>That would be selfishly nice for me to think that,</p>
<p>okay, I&rsquo;m connected to this thread line</p>
<p>through the future of the world,</p>
<p>but if it turns out, okay, there&rsquo;s a jump there.</p>
<p>They found a better way to design cognitive systems.</p>
<p>They designed a wholly new kind of thing.</p>
<p>And the only line is some causal chain of designing</p>
<p>and systems that design better systems.</p>
<p>Is that so much worse?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re still at least part of a causal chain of design.</p>
<p>And yes, they&rsquo;re not humans,</p>
<p>but still they&rsquo;re our successes.</p>
<p>So, I mean, ultimately I think it&rsquo;s probably inevitable</p>
<p>that something like that will happen.</p>
<p>And at least we were part of the process.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d be nice if they still cared enough about us</p>
<p>to maybe to engage with our arguments.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really hoping that the AGI&rsquo;s are gonna solve</p>
<p>all the problems of philosophy.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll come back and read all this crappy work</p>
<p>for the 20th and 21st century,</p>
<p>hard problem of consciousness.</p>
<p>And here is why they got it wrong.</p>
<p>And so, and if that happened,</p>
<p>then I&rsquo;d really feel like I was part of</p>
<p>at least an intellectual process over centuries.</p>
<p>And that would be kind of cool.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m pretty sure they would clone</p>
<p>or they would recreate David Chalmers</p>
<p>and for the fun of it,</p>
<p>sort of bring back other philosophers.</p>
<p>Yeah, bring back Descartes.</p>
<p>Descartes and just put them in a room and just watch.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll be a Netflix of the future show</p>
<p>where you bring philosophers from different human,</p>
<p>100% human philosophers from previous generations,</p>
<p>put them in a room and see them.</p>
<p>I am totally up for that.</p>
<p>Simulators, AGI&rsquo;s of the future,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re watching this podcast, do that.</p>
<p>I would like to be recreated and ending out with Descartes.</p>
<p>Where Descartes would be the first,</p>
<p>if you could hang out as part of such a TV show</p>
<p>with a philosopher that&rsquo;s no longer with us from long ago,</p>
<p>who would you choose?</p>
<p>Descartes would have to be right up there.</p>
<p>Oh, actually a couple of months ago,</p>
<p>I got to have a conversation with Descartes,</p>
<p>an actor who&rsquo;s actually a philosopher</p>
<p>came out on stage playing Descartes.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know this was gonna happen.</p>
<p>And I just after I gave a talk</p>
<p>and told me about how my ideas were crap</p>
<p>and all derived from him.</p>
<p>And so we had a long argument.</p>
<p>This was great.</p>
<p>I would love to see what Descartes would think about AI,</p>
<p>for example, and the modern neuroscience.</p>
<p>And so I suspect not too much would surprise him,</p>
<p>but yeah, William James,</p>
<p>for a psychologist of consciousness,</p>
<p>I think James was probably the richest.</p>
<p>But, oh, there are Immanuel Kant.</p>
<p>I never really understood what he was up to</p>
<p>if I got to actually talk to him about some of this.</p>
<p>Hey, there was Princess Elizabeth who talked with Descartes</p>
<p>and who really got at the problems</p>
<p>of how Descartes ideas of a nonphysical mind</p>
<p>interacting with the physical body couldn&rsquo;t really work.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s been kind of, most philosophers</p>
<p>think she&rsquo;s been proved right.</p>
<p>So maybe put me in a room with Descartes</p>
<p>and Princess Elizabeth and we can all argue it out.</p>
<p>What kind of future?</p>
<p>So we talked about zombies, a concerning future,</p>
<p>but what kind of future excites you?</p>
<p>What do you think if we look forward sort of,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re at the very early stages</p>
<p>of understanding consciousness.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re now at the early stages</p>
<p>of being able to engineer complex, interesting systems</p>
<p>that have degrees of intelligence.</p>
<p>And maybe one day we&rsquo;ll have degrees of consciousness,</p>
<p>maybe be able to upload brains,</p>
<p>all those possibilities, virtual reality.</p>
<p>Is there a particular aspect to this future world</p>
<p>that just excites you?</p>
<p>Well, I think there are lots of different aspects.</p>
<p>I mean, frankly, I want it to hurry up and happen.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, yeah, we&rsquo;ve had some progress lately in AI and VR,</p>
<p>but in the grand scheme of things, it&rsquo;s still kind of slow.</p>
<p>The changes are not yet transformative.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m in my fifties, I&rsquo;ve only got so long left.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to see really serious AI in my lifetime</p>
<p>and really serious virtual worlds.</p>
<p>Cause yeah, once people,</p>
<p>I would like to be able to hang out in a virtual reality,</p>
<p>which is richer than this reality</p>
<p>to really get to inhabit fundamentally different kinds</p>
<p>of spaces.</p>
<p>Well, I would very much like to be able to upload</p>
<p>my mind onto a computer.</p>
<p>So maybe I don&rsquo;t have to die.</p>
<p>If this is maybe gradually replaced my neurons</p>
<p>with a Silicon chips and inhabit a computer.</p>
<p>Selfishly, that would be wonderful.</p>
<p>I suspect I&rsquo;m not gonna quite get there in my lifetime,</p>
<p>but once that&rsquo;s possible,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;ve got the possibility of transforming</p>
<p>your consciousness in remarkable ways,</p>
<p>augmenting it, enhancing it.</p>
<p>So let me ask then,</p>
<p>if such a system is a possibility within your lifetime</p>
<p>and you were given the opportunity to become immortal</p>
<p>in this kind of way, would you choose to be immortal?</p>
<p>Yes, I totally would.</p>
<p>I know some people say they couldn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;d be awful to be immortal, be so boring or something.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see, I really don&rsquo;t see why this might be.</p>
<p>I mean, even if it&rsquo;s just ordinary life that continues,</p>
<p>ordinary life is not so bad.</p>
<p>But furthermore, I kind of suspect that,</p>
<p>if the universe is gonna go on forever or indefinitely,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna continue to be interesting.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think your view was that we just have to get</p>
<p>this one romantic point of interest now</p>
<p>and afterwards it&rsquo;s all gonna be boring,</p>
<p>super intelligent stasis.</p>
<p>I guess my vision is more like,</p>
<p>no, it&rsquo;s gonna continue to be infinitely interesting.</p>
<p>Something like as you go up the set theoretic hierarchy,</p>
<p>you go from the finite cardinals to Aleph zero</p>
<p>and then through there to all the Aleph one and Aleph two</p>
<p>and maybe the continuum and you keep taking power sets</p>
<p>and in set theory, they&rsquo;ve got these results</p>
<p>that actually all this is fundamentally unpredictable.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t follow any simple computational patterns.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s new levels of creativity</p>
<p>as the set theoretic universe expands and expands.</p>
<p>I guess that&rsquo;s my future.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my vision of the future.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my optimistic vision</p>
<p>of the future of super intelligence.</p>
<p>It will keep expanding and keep growing,</p>
<p>but still being fundamentally unpredictable at many points.</p>
<p>I mean, yes, this creates all kinds of worries</p>
<p>like couldn&rsquo;t all be fragile and be destroyed at any point.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re gonna need a solution to that problem.</p>
<p>But if we get to stipulate that I&rsquo;m immortal,</p>
<p>well, I hope that I&rsquo;m not just immortal and stuck</p>
<p>in the single world forever,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m immortal and get to take part in this process</p>
<p>of going through infinitely rich, created futures.</p>
<p>Rich, unpredictable, exciting.</p>
<p>Well, I think I speak for a lot of people in saying,</p>
<p>I hope you do become immortal and there&rsquo;ll be</p>
<p>that Netflix show, The Future,</p>
<p>where you get to argue with Descartes,</p>
<p>perhaps for all eternity.</p>
<p>So David, it was an honor.</p>

<p>from David Chalmers.</p>
<p>Materialism is a beautiful and compelling view of the world,</p>
<p>but to account for consciousness,</p>
<p>we have to go beyond the resources it provides.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.</p>
