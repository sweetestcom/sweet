    <p>no reason to think that the ocean ends just beyond your horizon. And likewise, there&rsquo;s no reason to</p>
<p>think that the aftermath of our Big Bang ends just at the boundary of what we can see. Indeed,</p>
<p>there are quite strong arguments that it probably goes on about 100 times further.</p>
<p>It may even go on so much further that all combinatorials are replicated. And there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>another set of people like us sitting in a room like this. The following is a conversation with</p>
<p>Lord Martin Rees, Emeritus Professor of Cosmology and Astrophysics at Cambridge University and</p>
<p>co founder of the Center for the Study of Existential Risk. This is the Lex Friedman</p>
<p>podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now,</p>
<p>dear friends, here&rsquo;s Martin Rees. In your 2020 Scientific American article,</p>
<p>you write that, quote, today we know that the universe is far bigger and stranger than anyone</p>
<p>suspected. So what do you think are the strangest, maybe the most beautiful, or maybe even the most</p>
<p>terrifying things lurking out there in the cosmos? Well, of course, we&rsquo;re still groping for any</p>
<p>detailed understanding of the remote parts of the universe. But of course, what we&rsquo;ve learned in the</p>
<p>last few decades is really two things. First, we&rsquo;ve understood that the universe had an origin</p>
<p>about 13.8 billion years ago, in a so called Big Bang, a hot 10 states, whose very beginnings are</p>
<p>still shrouded in mystery. And also, we&rsquo;ve learned more about the extreme things in it, black holes,</p>
<p>neutron stars, explosions of various kinds. And one of the most potentially exciting discoveries</p>
<p>in the last 20 years, mainly in the last 10, has been the realization that most of the stars in the</p>
<p>sky are orbited by retinues of planets, just as the Sun is orbited by the Earth and the other</p>
<p>familiar planets. And this, of course, makes the night sky far more interesting. What you see up</p>
<p>there aren&rsquo;t just points of light, but they&rsquo;re planetary systems. And that raises the question,</p>
<p>could there be life out there? And so that is an exciting problem for the 21st century.</p>
<p>So when you see all those lights out there, you immediately imagine all the planetary worlds that</p>
<p>are around them, and they potentially have all kinds of different lives, living organisms,</p>
<p>life forms or different histories. Well, that we don&rsquo;t know at all. We know</p>
<p>that these planets are there. We know that they have masses and orbits rather like the</p>
<p>planets of our solar system. But we don&rsquo;t know at all if there&rsquo;s any life on any of them. I mean,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s entirely logically possible that life is unique to this Earth, doesn&rsquo;t exist anywhere.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it could be that the origin of life is something which happens routinely given</p>
<p>conditions like the young Earth, in which case there could be literally billions of places in</p>
<p>our galaxy where some sort of biosphere has evolved. And settling where the truth lies</p>
<p>between those two extremes is a challenge for the coming decades.</p>
<p>So certainly we&rsquo;re either lucky to be here or very, very, very lucky to be here.</p>
<p>I guess that&rsquo;s the difference. Where do you fall? Your own estimate,</p>
<p>your own guess on this question. Are we alone in the universe, do you think?</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re foolish to give any firm estimate because we just don&rsquo;t know. And that&rsquo;s just an</p>
<p>example of how we are depending on greater observations. And also, incidentally,</p>
<p>in the case of life, we&rsquo;ve got to take account of the fact that, as I always say to my scientific</p>
<p>colleagues, biology is a much harder subject than physics. And most of the universe that we know</p>
<p>about could be understood by physics. But we&rsquo;ve got to remember that even the smallest living</p>
<p>organism, an insect, is far more complicated with layer on layer complexity than the most</p>
<p>complicated star or galaxy. That&rsquo;s the funny thing about physics</p>
<p>and biology. The dream of physicists in the 20th century and maybe this century is to discover</p>
<p>the theory of everything. And there&rsquo;s a sense that once you discover that theory,</p>
<p>you will understand everything. If we unlock the mysteries of how the universe works,</p>
<p>would you be able to understand how life emerges from that fabric of the universe that we understand?</p>
<p>I think the phrase, theory of everything, is very misleading because it&rsquo;s used to describe</p>
<p>a theory which unifies the three laws of microphysics, electricity,</p>
<p>magnetism, and weak interaction with gravity. So it&rsquo;s an important step forward for particle</p>
<p>physicists. But the lack of such a theory doesn&rsquo;t hold up any other scientists. Anyone doing</p>
<p>biology or most of physics is not held up at all through not understanding subnuclear physics.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re held up because they&rsquo;re dealing with things that are very complicated.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s especially true of anything biological. So what&rsquo;s holding up biologists is not a lack of</p>
<p>the so called theory of everything. It&rsquo;s the inability to understand things which are very</p>
<p>complicated. What do you think we&rsquo;ll understand first? How the universe works or how the human</p>
<p>body works deeply, like from a fundamental deep level? Well, I think, perhaps we can come back to</p>
<p>it later, that there are only limited prospects of ever being able to understand with unaided human</p>
<p>brains the most fundamental theories linking together all the forces of nature. I think that</p>
<p>may be a limitation of the human brains. But I also think that we can, perhaps aided by computer</p>
<p>simulations, understand a bit more of the complexity of nature. But even understanding a</p>
<p>simple organism from the atom up is very, very difficult. And I think extreme reductionists have</p>
<p>a very misleading perception. They tend to think that, in a sense, we are all solutions to</p>
<p>Schrodinger&rsquo;s equation, etc. But that isn&rsquo;t the way we&rsquo;ll ever understand anything. It may be true</p>
<p>that we are reductionists in the sense that we believe that that&rsquo;s the case. We don&rsquo;t believe in</p>
<p>any special life force in living things. But nonetheless, no one thinks that we can understand</p>
<p>a living thing by solving Schrodinger&rsquo;s equation. To take an example which isn&rsquo;t as complicated,</p>
<p>lots of people study the flow of fluids like water, why waves break, why flows go turbulent,</p>
<p>things like that. This is a serious branch of applied mathematics and engineering. And in doing</p>
<p>this, you have concepts of viscosity, turbulence, and things like that. Now, you can understand</p>
<p>quite a lot about how water behaves and how waves break in terms of those concepts. But the fact</p>
<p>that any breaking wave is a solution of Schrodinger&rsquo;s equation for 10 to the 30 particles,</p>
<p>even if you could solve that, which you clearly can&rsquo;t, would not give you any insight.</p>
<p>So the important thing is that every science has its own irreducible concepts</p>
<p>in which you get the best explanation. So it may be in chemistry, it&rsquo;s things like valence.</p>
<p>In biology, there are concepts in cell biology. And in ecology, there are concepts like</p>
<p>imprinting, etc. And in psychology, there are other concepts. So in a sense, the sciences are</p>
<p>like a tall building where you have basic physics, most fundamental, then the rest of</p>
<p>physics, then chemistry, then cell biology, etc., all the way up to the, I guess, economist in the</p>
<p>penthouse and all that. And we have that. And that&rsquo;s true in a sense. But it&rsquo;s not true that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like a building in that it&rsquo;s made unstable by an unstable base. Because if you&rsquo;re a chemist,</p>
<p>biologist, or an economist, you&rsquo;re facing challenging problems.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re not made any worse by uncertainty about subnuclear physics.</p>
<p>TK And at every level, just because you understand the rules of the game,</p>
<p>or have some understanding of the rules of the game, doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>TK mean you know what kind of beautiful things that game creates.</p>
<p>TK Right. So if you&rsquo;re interested in birds and how they fly, then things like imprinting</p>
<p>the baby on the mother and all that, and things like that, are what you need to understand.</p>
<p>You couldn&rsquo;t even in principle solve this fairly good equation, how an albatross</p>
<p>wanders for thousands of miles in the Southern Ocean and comes back and then coughs up</p>
<p>food for its young. That&rsquo;s something we can understand, in a sense,</p>
<p>and predict the behavior. But it&rsquo;s not because we can solve it on the atomic scale.</p>
<p>TK You mentioned that there might be some fundamental limitation to the human brain</p>
<p>that limits our ability to understand some aspect of how the universe works. That&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>interesting. That&rsquo;s sad, actually. To the degree it&rsquo;s true, it&rsquo;s sad. So what do you mean by that?</p>
<p>TK I would simply say that just as a monkey can&rsquo;t understand quantum theory or even Newtonian</p>
<p>physics, there&rsquo;s no particular reason why the human brain should have evolved to be well matched</p>
<p>to understanding the deepest aspects of reality. And I suspect that there may be aspects that we</p>
<p>are not even aware of and couldn&rsquo;t really fully comprehend.</p>
<p>But as an intermediate step towards that, one thing which I think is a very interesting</p>
<p>possibility is the extent to which AI can help us. I mean, I think if you take the example of</p>
<p>so called theories of everything, one of which is string theory.</p>
<p>String theory involves very complicated geometry and structures in 10 dimensions.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s certainly, in my view on the cards, that the physics of 10 dimensions,</p>
<p>very complicated geometry, may be too hard for a human being to work through,</p>
<p>but could be worked through by an AI with the advantage of the huge processing power,</p>
<p>which enables them to learn world championship chess within a few hours just by watching games.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s every reason to expect that these machines could help us to solve these problems.</p>
<p>And of course, if that&rsquo;s the way we came to understand whether string theory was right,</p>
<p>it should be in a sense frustrating because you wouldn&rsquo;t get the sort of aha insight,</p>
<p>which is the greatest satisfaction from doing science. But on the other hand, if a machine</p>
<p>churns away at 10 dimensional geometry, figuring out all the possible origamis wound up in extra</p>
<p>dimensions, if it comes out at the end, spews out the correct mass of the electron, the fact that</p>
<p>there are three kinds of neutrinos, something like that, you would know that there was some truth in</p>
<p>the theory. And so we may have a theory which we come to trust because it does predict things that</p>
<p>we can observe and check, but we may never really understand the full workings of it to the extent</p>
<p>that we do more or less understand how most phenomena can be explained in a fundamental way.</p>
<p>Of course, in the case of quantum theory, many people would say,</p>
<p>understand if there&rsquo;s still some mystery, if you don&rsquo;t quite understand why it works.</p>
<p>But there could be deeper mysteries when we get to these unified theories, where there&rsquo;s a big gap</p>
<p>between what a computer can print out for us at the end and what we can actually grasp and think</p>
<p>through in our heads. Yeah, it&rsquo;s interesting that the idea that there could be things a computer</p>
<p>could tell us that is true. And maybe it can even help us understand why it&rsquo;s true a little bit,</p>
<p>but ultimately it&rsquo;s still a long journey to really deeply understand the whys of it.</p>
<p>Yes, and that&rsquo;s the limitation of our brain. We can try to sneak up to it in different ways,</p>
<p>given the limitations of our brain. I&rsquo;ve gotten a chance to spend the day at DeepMind,</p>
<p>talk to Demis Hassabis. His big dream is to apply AI to the questions of science,</p>
<p>certainly to the questions of physics. Have you gotten a chance to interact with him?</p>
<p>Well, I know him quite well. He&rsquo;s one of my heroes, certainly.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure he would say the same.</p>
<p>And I remember the first time I met him, he said that he was like me, he wants to understand the</p>
<p>universe, but he thought the best thing to do was to try and develop AI. And then with the help of</p>
<p>AI, he&rsquo;d stand more chance of understanding the universe. And I think he&rsquo;s right about that.</p>
<p>And of course, although we&rsquo;re familiar with the way his computers play go and chess,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s already made contributions to science through understanding protein folding better</p>
<p>than the best human chemists. And so already he&rsquo;s on the path to showing ways in which computers</p>
<p>have the power to learn and do things by having ability to analyze enormous samples in a short</p>
<p>time to do better than humans. And so I think he would resonate for what I just said, that it may</p>
<p>be that in these other fundamental questions, the computers will play a crucial role.</p>
<p>Yeah. And they&rsquo;re also doing a quantum mechanical simulation of electrons. They&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>control of high temperature plasmas, fusion reactors.</p>
<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s a new thing, which is very interesting. They can suppress the instabilities</p>
<p>in these tokamaks better than any other way. Yeah.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just the march of progress by AIs in science is making big strides. Do you think</p>
<p>an AI system will win a Nobel Prize in the century? What do you think?</p>
<p>And does that make you sad?</p>
<p>If I can digress and put in a plug for my next book, it has a chapter saying,</p>
<p>why Nobel Prizes do more harm than good. So on a quite separate subject, I think</p>
<p>the Nobel Prizes do a great deal of damage to the perception of the way science is done.</p>
<p>Of course, if you ask who or what deserves the credit for any scientific discovery,</p>
<p>it may be often someone who has an idea, a team of people who work a big experiment, etc.</p>
<p>And of course, it&rsquo;s the quality of the equipment, which is crucial. And certainly in the subjects</p>
<p>I do in astronomy, the huge advances we&rsquo;ve had come not from us being more intelligent than</p>
<p>Aristotle was, but through us having far, far better data from powerful telescopes on the</p>
<p>ground and in space. And also, incidentally, we&rsquo;ve benefited hugely in astronomy from computer</p>
<p>simulations. Because if you are a subatomic physicist, then of course, you crash together</p>
<p>the particles in the big accelerator like the one at CERN and see what happens. But I can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>crash together two galaxies or two stars and see what happens. But in the virtual world of a</p>
<p>computer, one can do simulations like that. And the power of computers is such that these</p>
<p>simulations can yield phenomena and insights which we wouldn&rsquo;t have guessed beforehand. And the way</p>
<p>we can feel we&rsquo;re making progress and trying to understand some of these phenomena, why galaxies</p>
<p>have the size and shape they do and all that, is because we can do simulations and tweaking</p>
<p>different initial conditions and seeing which gives the best fit to what we actually observe.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s a way in which we&rsquo;ve made progress in using computers. And incidentally, we also now</p>
<p>need to analyze data because one thinks of astronomy as being traditionally rather data</p>
<p>poor subjects. But the European satellite called Gaia has just put online the speeds and colors</p>
<p>and properties of nearly two billion stars in the Milky Way, which we can do fantastic analyses of.</p>
<p>And that, of course, could not be done at all without just the number crunching capacity</p>
<p>of computers. And the new methods of machine learning actually love raw data, the kind that</p>
<p>astronomy provides, organized, structured, raw data. Well, indeed, because the reason they really</p>
<p>have a benefit over us is that they can learn and think so much faster. That&rsquo;s how they can</p>
<p>learn to play chess and go. That&rsquo;s how they can learn to diagnose lung cancer better than a</p>
<p>radiologist because they can look at 100,000 scans in a few days, whereas no human radiologist sees</p>
<p>that many a lifetime. Well, there&rsquo;s still magic to the human intelligence, to the intuition,</p>
<p>to the common sense reasoning. Well, we hope so. For now. What is the new book that you mentioned?</p>
<p>The book I mentioned is called If Science is to Save Us. It&rsquo;s coming out in September.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s on the big challenges of science, climate, dealing with biosafety and dealing</p>
<p>with cyber safety. And also, it&rsquo;s got chapters on the way science is organized, universities</p>
<p>and academies, et cetera, and the ethics of science and education. And the limits, yes.</p>
<p>Yes. Well, let me actually just stroll around the beautiful and the strange of the universe.</p>
<p>Over 20 years ago, you hypothesized that we would solve the mystery of dark matter by now.</p>
<p>So unfortunately, we didn&rsquo;t quite yet. First, what is dark matter and why has it been so tough</p>
<p>to figure out? Well, I mean, we learned that galaxies and other large scale structures,</p>
<p>which are moving around but preventive of flying apart by gravity, would be flying apart if they</p>
<p>only contain the stuff we see, if everything in them is shining. And to understand how galaxies</p>
<p>formed and why they do remain confined the same size, one has to infer that there&rsquo;s about five</p>
<p>times as much stuff producing gravitational forces than the total amount of stuff in the</p>
<p>gas and stars that we see. And that stuff is called dark matter. That&rsquo;s the leading name,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not dark, it&rsquo;s just transparent, et cetera. And the most likely interpretation is that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a swarm of microscopic particles which have no electric charge. And the very small cross sections</p>
<p>were hitting each other and hitting anything else. So they swarm around and we can detect their</p>
<p>collective effects. And when we do computer simulations of how galaxies form and evolve</p>
<p>and how they emerge from the Big Bang, then we get a nice consistent picture if we put in</p>
<p>five times as much mass in the form of these mysterious dark particles. And for instance,</p>
<p>it works better if we think they&rsquo;re not interacting particles than if you think they&rsquo;re a gas which</p>
<p>would have shockwaves and things. So we know something about the properties of these, but we</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know what they are. And the disappointment compared to my guess 20 years ago is that</p>
<p>particles answering this description have not yet been found. It was thought that the</p>
<p>big accelerator, the Large Hadron Collider at CERN, which is the world&rsquo;s biggest,</p>
<p>might have found a new class of particles which would have been the obvious candidates.</p>
<p>And it hasn&rsquo;t. And some people say, well, dark matter can&rsquo;t be there, etc. But what I would argue</p>
<p>is that there&rsquo;s a huge amount of parameter space that hasn&rsquo;t been explored. There are other kinds</p>
<p>of particles called axions which behave slightly differently, which are good candidates. And</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a factor of 10 powers of 10 between the heaviest particles that could be created by</p>
<p>the Large Hadron Collider and the heaviest particles which on theoretical grounds could exist</p>
<p>without turning into black holes. So there&rsquo;s a huge amount of possible particles which could be</p>
<p>out there as remnants of the Big Bang, but which we wouldn&rsquo;t be able to detect so easily. So the</p>
<p>fact that we&rsquo;ve got new constraints on what the dark matter could be doesn&rsquo;t diminish my belief</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s there in the form of particles because we&rsquo;ve only explored a small fraction of parameter</p>
<p>space. So there&rsquo;s this search, you&rsquo;re literally, upon an unintended, are searching in the dark</p>
<p>here in this giant parameter space of possible particles. You&rsquo;re searching for, I mean,</p>
<p>there could be all kinds of particles. There could be, and there&rsquo;s some which may be very,</p>
<p>very hard to detect. But I think we can hope for some new theoretical ideas because one point which</p>
<p>perhaps we&rsquo;d like to discuss more is about the very early stages of the Big Bang.</p>
<p>And the situation now is that we have an outline picture for how the universe has evolved from</p>
<p>the time when it was expanding in just a nanosecond up to the present. And we could do</p>
<p>that because after nanosecond, the physics of the material is in the same range that we can test in</p>
<p>the lab. After a nanosecond, the particles move around like those in the Large Hadron Collider.</p>
<p>If you wait for one second, they&rsquo;re rather like in the centers of the hottest stars. And nuclear</p>
<p>reactions produce hydrogen, helium, et cetera, which fit the data. So we can with confidence</p>
<p>extrapolate back to when the universe was a nanosecond old. Indeed, I think we can do it with</p>
<p>as much confidence as anything a geologist tells you about the early history of the Earth.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s huge progress in the last 50 years. But any progress puts in sharper focus new mysteries.</p>
<p>And of course, the new mysteries in this context are, why is the universe expanding the way it is?</p>
<p>Why does it contain this mixture of atoms and dark matter and radiation? And why does it have</p>
<p>the properties which allow galaxies to form, being fairly smooth but not completely smooth?</p>
<p>And the answer to those questions, I generally believe, to lie in a much, much earlier stage</p>
<p>of the universe, when conditions were much more extreme, and therefore far beyond the stage where</p>
<p>we have the foothold in experiments. Very theoretical. And so we don&rsquo;t have a convincing</p>
<p>theory. We just have ideas. Until we have something like string theory or some other</p>
<p>clues to the ultra early universe, that&rsquo;s going to remain speculative. So there&rsquo;s a big gap.</p>
<p>And to say how big the gap is, if we take the observable universe out of a bit more than 10</p>
<p>billion light years, then when the universe was a nanosecond old, that would have been squeezed down</p>
<p>to the size of our solar system, or compressed into that volume. But the times we&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about when the key properties of the universe were first imprinted were times when that entire</p>
<p>universe was squeezed down to the size of a tennis ball, or baseball if you prefer, and it emerged</p>
<p>from something microscopic. So it&rsquo;s a huge extrapolation. And it&rsquo;s not surprising that,</p>
<p>since it&rsquo;s so far from our experimental range of detectability, we are still groping for ideas.</p>
<p>TG But you think first theory will reach into that place, and then experiment will perhaps</p>
<p>one day catch up, maybe simulation. JG Well, I think in a sense it&rsquo;s a combination. I think</p>
<p>what we hope for is that there&rsquo;ll be a theory which applies to the early universe,</p>
<p>which also has consequences which we can test in our present day universe, like discovering</p>
<p>why neutrinos exist or things like that. And that&rsquo;s the thing which, as I mentioned,</p>
<p>we may perhaps need a bit of AI to help us to calculate. But I think the hope would be</p>
<p>that we will have a theory which applies under the very, very extreme early stages of the universe,</p>
<p>but which gains credibility and gains confidence, because it also manages to account for otherwise</p>
<p>unexplained features of the low energy world, what people call the standard model of particle</p>
<p>physics, where there are lots of undetermined numbers. So it may help with that. TG So we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>dancing between physics and philosophy a little bit, but what do you think happened before the</p>
<p>Big Bang? So this feels like something that&rsquo;s out of the reach of science. JG It&rsquo;s out of the reach</p>
<p>of present science, because science develops and as the front is advanced, then new problems come</p>
<p>into focus that couldn&rsquo;t even have been postulated before. I mean, if I think of my own career,</p>
<p>when I was a student, the evidence for the Big Bang was pretty weak, whereas now it&rsquo;s extremely</p>
<p>strong. But we are now thinking about the reason why the universe is the way it is and all that.</p>
<p>So I would put all these things we&rsquo;ve just mentioned in the category of speculative science.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t see a bifurcation between that and philosophy. But of course, to answer your question,</p>
<p>if we do want to understand the very early universe, then we&rsquo;ve got to realize that</p>
<p>it may involve even more counterintuitive concepts than quantum theory does, because it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>condition even further away from everyday world than quantum theory is. And remember, our lives,</p>
<p>our brains evolved and haven&rsquo;t changed much since our ancestors roamed the African savanna and</p>
<p>looked at the everyday world. And it&rsquo;s rather amazing that we&rsquo;ve been able to make some sense</p>
<p>of the quantum micro world and of the cosmos. But there may be some things which are beyond us. And</p>
<p>certainly, as you implied, there are things that we don&rsquo;t yet understand at all. And of course,</p>
<p>one concept we might have to jettison is the idea of three dimensions of space and time just ticking</p>
<p>away. There are lots of ideas. I mean, I think Stephen Hawking had an idea. They&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>what happened before the Big Bang. It&rsquo;s like asking what happens if you go north from the</p>
<p>North Pole. It somehow closes off. That&rsquo;s just one idea. I don&rsquo;t like that idea, but that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>possible one. And so we just don&rsquo;t know what happened at the very beginning of the Big Bang,</p>
<p>were there many Big Bangs rather than one, etc. And those are issues which we may be able to</p>
<p>get some foothold on from some new theory. But even then, we won&rsquo;t be able to directly</p>
<p>test the theories. But I think it&rsquo;s a heresy to think you have to be able to test every prediction</p>
<p>of a theory. Let me give you another example. We take seriously what Einstein&rsquo;s theory says</p>
<p>about the inside of black holes, even though we can&rsquo;t observe them, because that theory has been</p>
<p>vindicated in many other places in cosmology and black holes, gravitational waves, and all those</p>
<p>things. Likewise, if we had a theory which explains some things about the early history</p>
<p>of our Big Bang and the present universe, then we would take seriously the inference if it</p>
<p>predicted many Big Bangs, not one, even though we can&rsquo;t predict the other ones. So the example is</p>
<p>we can take seriously a prediction if it&rsquo;s the consequence of a theory that we believe</p>
<p>on other grounds. We don&rsquo;t need to be able to detect another Big Bang in order to take it</p>
<p>seriously. It may not be a proof, but it&rsquo;s a good indication that this is the direction where the</p>
<p>truth lies. Yeah, if the theory is getting confidence in other ways. Where do you sense?</p>
<p>Do you think there&rsquo;s other universes besides our own? There are sort of well defined theories which</p>
<p>make assumptions about the physics at the relevant time, and this time, incidentally,</p>
<p>is 10 to the power minus 36 seconds or earlier than that, so this tiny sliver of time.</p>
<p>There are some theories, a famous one due to Andrei Linde, the Russian cosmologist now at</p>
<p>Stanford, called eternal inflation, which did predict an eternal production of new Big Bangs,</p>
<p>as it were, and that&rsquo;s based on specific assumptions about the physics. But those</p>
<p>assumptions, of course, are just hypotheses which aren&rsquo;t vindicated. But there are other</p>
<p>theories which only predict one Big Bang. So I think we should be open minded and not dogmatic</p>
<p>about these options until we do understand the relevant physics. But there are these different</p>
<p>scenarios of very different ideas about this. But I think all of them have the feature that</p>
<p>physical reality is a lot more extensive than what we can see through our telescope. I think</p>
<p>even most conservative astronomers would say that because we can see out with our telescopes to a</p>
<p>sort of horizon, which is about, depending on how you measure it, maybe 15 billion light years away</p>
<p>or something like that. But that horizon of observations is no more physical reality than</p>
<p>the horizon around you if you&rsquo;re in the ocean and looking out at your horizon. There&rsquo;s no reason to</p>
<p>think that the ocean ends just beyond your horizon. And likewise, there&rsquo;s no reason to think that</p>
<p>the aftermath of our Big Bang ends just at the boundary of what we can see. Indeed,</p>
<p>there are quite strong arguments that it probably goes on about 100 times further.</p>
<p>It may even go on so much further that all combinatorials are replicated. And there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>another set of people like us sitting in a room like this. That&rsquo;s not logically impossible.</p>
<p>But I think many people would accept that it does go on and contain probably a million times</p>
<p>as much stuff as what we can see within a horizon. The reason for that, incidentally,</p>
<p>is that if we look as far as we can in one direction and in the opposite direction,</p>
<p>then the conditions don&rsquo;t differ by more than one part in 100,000. So that means that if we&rsquo;re part</p>
<p>of some finite structure, the gradient across the part we can see is very small. And so that</p>
<p>suggests that it probably does go on a lot further. And the best estimates say it must</p>
<p>go on at least 20 times further. LR ‚Äì Is that exciting or terrifying to you?</p>
<p>Just the spans of it all, the wide, everything that lies beyond the horizon.</p>
<p>That example doesn&rsquo;t even hold for Earth, so it goes way, way farther. And on top of that,</p>
<p>just to take your metaphor further on the ocean, while we&rsquo;re on top of this ocean,</p>
<p>not only can we not see beyond the horizon, we also don&rsquo;t know much about the depth of the ocean,</p>
<p>nor the actual mechanism of observation that&rsquo;s in our head.</p>
<p>RL ‚Äì I don&rsquo;t think the perception of this utterly vast cosmos need have any deeper impact</p>
<p>on us than just realizing that we are very small on the scale of the external world.</p>
<p>LR ‚Äì Yeah, it&rsquo;s humbling though. It&rsquo;s humbling, depending where your ego is, it&rsquo;s humbling.</p>
<p>RL ‚Äì Well, if you start off very unhumble indeed, it may make a difference. But for most of us,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it makes much of a difference. Well, there&rsquo;s a more general question, of course,</p>
<p>about whether the human race as such is something which is very special, or if on the other hand,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just one of many such species elsewhere in the universe, or indeed existing at different</p>
<p>times in our universe. LR ‚Äì To me, it feels almost obvious</p>
<p>that the universe should be full of alien life, perhaps dead alien civilizations, but</p>
<p>just the vastness of space. And it just feels wrong to think of Earth as somehow special. It</p>
<p>sure as heck doesn&rsquo;t look that special. The more we learn, the less special it seems.</p>
<p>RL ‚Äì Well, I mean, I don&rsquo;t agree with that as far as life is concerned, because remember that</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t understand how life began here on Earth. We don&rsquo;t understand, although we know there were</p>
<p>any evolution of simple life to complex life, we don&rsquo;t understand what caused the transition</p>
<p>between complex chemistry and the first replicating, metabolizing entity we call alive.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a mystery, and serious physicists and chemists are now thinking about it,</p>
<p>but we don&rsquo;t know. So we therefore can&rsquo;t say, was it a rare fluke which would not have happened</p>
<p>anywhere else, or was it something which involves a process that would have happened in any other</p>
<p>planet where conditions were like they were on the young Earth? So we can&rsquo;t say that now. I think</p>
<p>many of us would indeed bet that probably some kind of life exists elsewhere. But even if you</p>
<p>accept that, then there are many contingencies going from simple life to present day life.</p>
<p>Some biologists like Stephen Jay Gould thought that if you reround evolution,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d end up with something quite different, and maybe not with an intelligent species. So</p>
<p>the contingencies in evolution may militate against the emergence of intelligence,</p>
<p>even if life gets started in lots of places. So I think these are still completely open questions,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s such an exciting time now that we are starting to be able to address these.</p>
<p>I mentioned the fact that the origin of life is a question that we may be able to understand,</p>
<p>and serious people are working on it. It used to be put in a sort of too difficult box. Everyone</p>
<p>knew it was important, but they didn&rsquo;t know how to tackle it or what experiments to do.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not like that now. That&rsquo;s partly because of clever experiments, but I think most</p>
<p>importantly because we are aware that we can look for life in other places, other places in our</p>
<p>solar system, and of course, on the exoplanets around other stars. And within 10 or 20 years,</p>
<p>I think two things could happen, which would be really, really important. We might,</p>
<p>with the next big telescope, be able to image some of the Earth like planets around other stars.</p>
<p>TG. Image, like get a picture?</p>
<p>MR. Well, actually, caveat that, it&rsquo;d take 50 years to get a resolved image,</p>
<p>but try to detect the light. Because now, of course, these exoplanets are detected by their</p>
<p>effects on the parent star. They either cause their parent star to dim slightly when they</p>
<p>transit across in front of it, and so we see the dips, or their gravitational pull makes the star</p>
<p>wobble a bit. So most of the 5,000 plus planets that have been found around other stars, they&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>been found indirectly by their effect in one of those two ways on the parent star.</p>
<p>TG. You can still do a pretty good job estimating size, all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>MR. The size and the mass, you can estimate. But detecting the actual light from one of these</p>
<p>exoplanets hasn&rsquo;t really been done yet, except for one or two very bright, big planets.</p>
<p>TG. So maybe like James Webb Telescope.</p>
<p>MR. Well, James Webb may do this, but even better will be the European ground based telescope</p>
<p>called Unimaginatively Extremely Large Telescope, which has a 39 meter diameter mirror. 39 meters,</p>
<p>a mosaic of eight hundred sheets of glass, and that will collect enough light from one of these</p>
<p>exoplanets around a nearby star to be able to separate out its light from that of the star,</p>
<p>which is millions of times brighter, and get the spectrum of the planet and see if it&rsquo;s got</p>
<p>oxygen or chlorophyll and things in it. So that will come. James Webb may make some steps there.</p>
<p>But I think we can look forward to learning quite a bit in the next 20 years, because I like to say,</p>
<p>supposing that aliens were looking at the solar system. Then they&rsquo;d see the sun as an ordinary</p>
<p>star. They&rsquo;d see the Earth as, in Carl Sagan&rsquo;s nice phrase, a pale blue dot lying very close in</p>
<p>the sky to its star, our sun, and much, much, much fainter. But if they could observe that dot,</p>
<p>they could learn quite a bit. They could perhaps get the spectrum of the light and find the</p>
<p>atmosphere. They&rsquo;d find the shade of blue was slightly different, depending on whether the</p>
<p>Pacific Ocean or the land mass of Asia was facing them, so they could infer the length of the day</p>
<p>and the ocean and continents, and maybe something about the seasons and the climate.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the kind of calculation and inference we might be able to draw within the next 10 or 20</p>
<p>years about other exoplanets. Evidence of some sort of biosphere on one of them would, of course,</p>
<p>be crucial, and it would rule out the still logical possibility that life is unique.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s another way in which this may happen in the next 20 years. People think there could be</p>
<p>something swimming under the ice of Europa and Enceladus, and probes are being sent to maybe not</p>
<p>quite go under the ice but detect the spray coming out to see if there&rsquo;s evidence for organics in</p>
<p>that. And if we found any evidence for an origin of life that had happened in either of those</p>
<p>places, that would immediately be important. Because if life has originated twice independently</p>
<p>in one planetary system, the solar system, that would tell us straight away it wasn&rsquo;t a rare</p>
<p>accident and must have happened billions of times in the galaxy. At the moment, we can&rsquo;t rule out</p>
<p>it being unique. And incidentally, if we found life on Mars, then that would still be ambiguous</p>
<p>because people have realized that this early life could have got from Mars to Earth or vice versa</p>
<p>on meteorites. So if you found life on Mars, then some skeptics could still say if it&rsquo;s a single</p>
<p>origin. But I think that&rsquo;s far enough away statistically. So that&rsquo;s why that would be</p>
<p>especially&hellip; It&rsquo;s always the skeptics that ruin a good party. But we need them, of course. We need</p>
<p>them at the party. We need some skeptics at the party. But boy, would that be so exciting to find</p>
<p>life on one of the moons. Because it means that life is everywhere. That&rsquo;ll just be any kind of</p>
<p>vegetation or life. The question of the aliens of science fiction is a different matter.</p>
<p>LW. Intelligent aliens. Yeah, but if you have a good indication that there&rsquo;s life elsewhere in</p>
<p>the solar system, that means life is everywhere. I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s terrifying or what that is.</p>
<p>Because if life is everywhere, why is intelligent life not everywhere? You&rsquo;ve talked about that</p>
<p>most likely alien civilizations, if they are out there, they would likely be far ahead of us.</p>
<p>The ones that would actually communicate with us. And that, again, one of those things is both</p>
<p>exciting and terrifying. You&rsquo;ve mentioned that they&rsquo;re likely not to be of biological nature.</p>
<p>MR. Well, I think that&rsquo;s important. Of course, again, it&rsquo;s speculation. But in speculating about</p>
<p>intelligent life, and I take the search seriously. In fact, I chair the committee that the Russian</p>
<p>American investor Yuri Milner supports looking for intelligent life. He&rsquo;s putting $10 million</p>
<p>a year into better equipment and getting time on telescopes to do this. And so I think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>worthwhile, even though I don&rsquo;t hold my breath for success. It&rsquo;s very exciting. But that does</p>
<p>lead me to wonder what might be detected. And I think, well, we don&rsquo;t know. We&rsquo;ve got to be</p>
<p>open minded about anything. We have no idea what it could be. And so any anomalous objects,</p>
<p>or even some strange shiny objects in the solar system, or anything we&rsquo;ve got to keep our eyes</p>
<p>open for. But I think if we ask about a planet like the Earth, where evolution had taken more</p>
<p>of the same track, then, as you say, it wouldn&rsquo;t be synchronized. If it had lagged behind, then,</p>
<p>of course, it would not have got to advanced life. But it may have had a head start. It may</p>
<p>have formed on a planet around an older star. But then let&rsquo;s ask what we would see. It&rsquo;s taken</p>
<p>nearly four billion years from the first life to us. And we now got this technological civilization</p>
<p>which could make itself detectable to any aliens out there. But I think most people would say</p>
<p>that this civilization of flesh and blood creatures in a collective civilization may not last more</p>
<p>than a few hundred years more. I think that some people would say it will kill itself off. But I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>more optimistic. And I would say that what we&rsquo;re going to have in future is no longer the slow</p>
<p>Darwinian selection. But we&rsquo;re going to have what I call secular intelligent design, which will be</p>
<p>humans designing their progeny to be better adapted to where they are.</p>
<p>And if they go to Mars or somewhere, they&rsquo;re badly adapted and they want to adapt a lot.</p>
<p>And so they will adapt. But there may be some limits to what could be done with flesh and blood.</p>
<p>And so they may become largely electronic, download their brains and be electronic entities.</p>
<p>And if they&rsquo;re electronic, then what&rsquo;s important is that they&rsquo;re near immortal.</p>
<p>And also, they won&rsquo;t necessarily want to be on a planet with an atmosphere or gravity. They may</p>
<p>go off into the blue yonder. And if they&rsquo;re near immortal, they won&rsquo;t be daunted by interstellar</p>
<p>travel taking a long time. And so if we looked at what would happen on the Earth in the next</p>
<p>millions of years, then there may be these electronic entities, which have been sent out</p>
<p>and are now far away from the Earth, but still sort of burping away in some fashion to be detected.</p>
<p>And so this therefore leads me to think that if there was another planet which had evolved like</p>
<p>the Earth and was ahead of us, it wouldn&rsquo;t be synchronized, so we wouldn&rsquo;t see a flesh and</p>
<p>blood civilization, but we would see these electronic progeny, as it were. And then this</p>
<p>raises another question, because there&rsquo;s the famous argument against there being lots of</p>
<p>aliens out there, which is that they would come and invade us and eat us or something like that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a common idea, which Fermi is attributed to have been the first to say.</p>
<p>And I think there&rsquo;s an escape clause to that, because these entities would be</p>
<p>evolved by second intelligent design, designed by their predecessors and then designed by us.</p>
<p>Whereas Darwinian selection requires two things. It requires aggression and intelligence. This</p>
<p>future intelligent design may favor intelligence, because that&rsquo;s what they were designed for,</p>
<p>but it may not favor aggression. And so these future entities, they may be sitting deep thoughts,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re thinking deep thoughts, and not being at all expansionist. So they could be out there.</p>
<p>And we can&rsquo;t refute their existence in the way the Fermi paradox is supposed to refute their</p>
<p>existence, because these would not be aggressive or expansionist.</p>
<p>Well, maybe evolution requires competition, not aggression. And I wonder if competition</p>
<p>can take forms that are non expansionary. So you can still have fun competing in the space</p>
<p>of ideas, which maybe primarily&hellip;</p>
<p>The Darwin philosophers, perhaps, yeah.</p>
<p>In a way, right. It&rsquo;s an intellectual exercise versus a sort of violent exercise.</p>
<p>So what does this civilization on Mars look like? So do you think we would more and more</p>
<p>maybe start with some genetic modification and then move to basically cyborgs,</p>
<p>increasing integration of electronic systems, computational systems into our bodies and brains?</p>
<p>This is a theme of my other new book out this year, which is called The End of Astronauts.</p>
<p>The End of Astronauts.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s co written with my old friend and colleague from Berkeley, Don Goldsmith. And it&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>about the role of human spaceflight versus sort of robotic spaceflight. And just to summarize</p>
<p>what it says, it argues that the practical case for sending humans into space is getting</p>
<p>weaker all the time as robots get better and more capable. Robots 50 years ago couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>do anything very much, but now they could assemble big structures on space or in space</p>
<p>or on the moon, and they could probably do exploration. But present ones on Mars can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>actually do the geology, but future AI will be able to do the geology and already they</p>
<p>can dig on Mars. And so if you want to do exploration of Mars, and of course, even more</p>
<p>of Enceladus or Europa where you could never send humans, we depend on robots. And they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>far, far cheaper because to send a human to Mars requires feeding them for 200 days on</p>
<p>the journey there and bringing them back. And neither of those are necessary for robots.</p>
<p>So the practical case for humans is getting very, very weak. And if humans go, it&rsquo;s only</p>
<p>as an adventure, really. And so the line in our book is that human spaceflight should</p>
<p>not be pursued by NASA or public funding agencies because it has no practical purpose, but also</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s especially expensive if they do it because they would have to be risk averse</p>
<p>in launching civilians into space. I can illustrate that by noting that the shuttle</p>
<p>was launched 135 times and it had two spectacular failures, which each killed the seven people in</p>
<p>the crew. And it had been mistakenly presented as safe for civilians. And there was a woman</p>
<p>schoolteacher killed in one of them. It was a big national trauma and they tried to make</p>
<p>it safer still. But if you launch into space, just the kind of people prepared to accept that</p>
<p>sort of risk, and of course, test pilots and people who go hang gliding and go to the South</p>
<p>Pole, et cetera, are prepared to accept a 2% risk at least for a big challenge, then of course,</p>
<p>you do it more cheaply. And that&rsquo;s why I think human spaceflight should be left to the billionaires</p>
<p>and their sponsors because then the taxpayers aren&rsquo;t paying and they can launch simply those</p>
<p>people who are prepared to accept high risks. Space adventure, not space tourism. And we should</p>
<p>cheer them on. And as regards where they would go, then low Earth orbit, as I suspect, can be done</p>
<p>quite cheaply in the future. But going to Mars, which is very, very expensive and dangerous for</p>
<p>humans. The only people who would go would be these adventurers, maybe on one way trip,</p>
<p>like some of the early polar explorers and Magellan and people like that. And we would</p>
<p>cheer them on. And I expect and I&rsquo;ve ever hoped that by the end of a century, there will be a</p>
<p>small community of such people on Mars living very uncomfortably, far less comfortably than</p>
<p>at the South Pole or the bottom of the ocean or the top of Everest. But they will be there</p>
<p>and they won&rsquo;t have a return ticket, but they&rsquo;ll be there. Incidentally, I think it&rsquo;s a dangerous</p>
<p>illusion to think, as Elon Musk has said, that we can have mass emigration from the Earth to Mars</p>
<p>to escape the Earth&rsquo;s problems. It&rsquo;s a dangerous illusion because it&rsquo;s far easier to deal with</p>
<p>climate change on Earth than to terraform Mars to make it probably habitable to humans.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s no planet B for ordinary risk averse people. But for these crazy adventurers,</p>
<p>then you can imagine that they would be trying to live on Mars as great pioneers.</p>
<p>And by the end of a century, then there will be huge advances compared to the present in two</p>
<p>things. First, in understanding genetics, so as to genetically redesign one&rsquo;s offspring. And</p>
<p>secondly, to use cyborg techniques to implant something in our brain or indeed think about</p>
<p>downloading, et cetera. And those techniques will, one hopes, be heavily regulated on Earth on</p>
<p>prudentials and ethical grounds. And of course, we are pretty well adapted to the Earth, so we</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have the incentive to do these things in the way they were there. So our argument is that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll be those crazy pioneers on Mars using all these scientific advances, which will be</p>
<p>controlled here, away from the regulators, they will transition into a new post human species.</p>
<p>And so if they do that, and if they transition into something which is electronic,</p>
<p>eventually, because there may be some limits to the capacity of flesh and blood brains anyways,</p>
<p>then those electronic entities may not want to stay on a planet like Mars, they may want to go</p>
<p>away. And so they&rsquo;ll be the precursors of the future evolution of life and intelligence coming</p>
<p>from the Earth. And of course, there&rsquo;s one point which perhaps astronomers are more aware of than</p>
<p>most people. Most people are aware that we are the outcome of 4 billion years of evolution.</p>
<p>Most of them nonetheless, probably think that we humans are somehow the culmination,</p>
<p>the top of the tree. But yes, no astronomers can believe that because astronomers know</p>
<p>that the Earth is four and a half billion years old. The sun has been shiny for that length of</p>
<p>time. But the sun has got 6 billion years more to go before it flares up and engulfs the inner</p>
<p>planet. So the sun is less than halfway through its life. And the expanding universe goes on far</p>
<p>longer still, maybe forever. And I like to quote Woody Allen, who said, eternity is very long,</p>
<p>especially towards the end. So we shouldn&rsquo;t think of ourselves as maybe even the halfway stage</p>
<p>in the emergence of cosmic complexity. And so these entities who are postcursors,</p>
<p>they will go beyond the solar system. And of course, even if there&rsquo;s nothing else out there</p>
<p>already, then they could populate the rest of the galaxy. And maybe eventually meet the others who</p>
<p>are out there expanding as well. Expanding, populating with expanded capacity for life</p>
<p>and intelligence, all those kinds of things. Well, they might. But again, all better off.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t conceive what they&rsquo;d be like. They won&rsquo;t be green men and women with eyes on stalks.</p>
<p>Maybe something quite different. We just don&rsquo;t know. But there is an interesting question,</p>
<p>actually, which comes up when I&rsquo;ve sometimes spoken to audiences about this topic,</p>
<p>but the question of consciousness and self awareness. Because going back to philosophical</p>
<p>questions, whether an electronic robot would be a zombie, or would it be conscious and self aware?</p>
<p>And I think there&rsquo;s no way of answering this empirically. And some people think that</p>
<p>consciousness and self awareness is an emergent property in any sufficiently complicated networks</p>
<p>that they would be. Others say, well, maybe it&rsquo;s something special to the flesh and blood that we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>made of. We don&rsquo;t know. And in a sense, this may not matter to the way things behave because</p>
<p>they could be zombies and still behave as though they were intelligent. But I remember</p>
<p>after one of my talks, someone came up and said, wouldn&rsquo;t it be sad if these future entities,</p>
<p>which were the main intelligent in the universe, had no self awareness? So there was nothing</p>
<p>which could appreciate the wonder and mystery of the universe and the beauty of the universe</p>
<p>in the way that we do. And so it does perhaps affect one&rsquo;s perspective of whether you welcome</p>
<p>or deplore this possible future scenario, depending on whether you think the future</p>
<p>post human entities are conscious and have an aesthetic sense or whether they&rsquo;re just zombies.</p>
<p>And of course, you have to be humble to realize that self awareness may not be the</p>
<p>highest form of being, that humans have a very strong ego and a very strong sense of identity,</p>
<p>like personal identity connected to this particular brain. It&rsquo;s not so obvious to me</p>
<p>that that is somehow the highest achievement of a life form, that maybe this kind of&hellip;</p>
<p>Do you think something collective would be?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s possible that, well, I think from an alien perspective, when you look at Earth,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not so obvious to me that individual humans are the atoms of intelligence. It could be the</p>
<p>entire organism together, the collective intelligence. And so we humans think of</p>
<p>ourselves as individuals, we dress up, we wear ties and suits, and we&rsquo;ll give each other prizes.</p>
<p>But in reality, the intelligence, the things we create that are beautiful emerges from our</p>
<p>interaction with each other. And that may be where the intelligence is, ideas jumping from</p>
<p>one person to another over generations.</p>
<p>Yes, but we have experiences where we can appreciate beauty and wonder and all that.</p>
<p>And a zombie may not have those experiences.</p>
<p>Yeah, or it may have a very different, a very black and white,</p>
<p>harsh description of a philosophical zombie that could be just a very different way to experience.</p>
<p>And, you know, in terms of the explorers that colonize Mars,</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s several things I want to mention. One, it&rsquo;s just at a high level. To me,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s one of the most inspiring things humans can do, is reach out into the unknown. That&rsquo;s</p>
<p>in the space of ideas, in the space of science, but also the explorers.</p>
<p>Yes, no, I agree with that.</p>
<p>And that inspires people here on Earth more. I mean, it did in their, you know,</p>
<p>when going to the moon or going out to space in the 20th century, that inspired me.</p>
<p>I think that also could be used to inspire a generation of new scientists in the 21st century</p>
<p>by reaching out towards Mars. So in that sense, I think what Elon Musk and others are doing is</p>
<p>actually quite inspiring. It&rsquo;s not, it&rsquo;s not a recreational thing. It&rsquo;s actually has a deep</p>
<p>humanitarian purpose of really inspiring the world. And then, you know, I think, you know,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think Elon says we want to escape Earth&rsquo;s problems. It&rsquo;s more that we should allocate some</p>
<p>small percentage of resources to have a backup plan. And because you yourself have spoken about</p>
<p>and written about all the ways we clever humans destroy ourselves.</p>
<p>You could go on.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not sure, it does seem when you look at the long arc of human history, it seems almost</p>
<p>obvious that we need to become a multi planetary species over a period. If we are to survive many</p>
<p>centuries, it seems that as we get clever and clever with the ways we can destroy ourselves,</p>
<p>Earth is going to become less and less safe. So in that sense, this is one of the things,</p>
<p>you know, people talk about climate change and that we need to respond to climate change. And</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a long term investment we need to make, but it&rsquo;s not really long term. It&rsquo;s a span of decades.</p>
<p>I think what Elon is doing is a really long term investment.</p>
<p>We should be working on multi planetary colonization now if we were to have it ready</p>
<p>five centuries from now. And so taking those early steps. And then also there&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>happens when you go into the unknown and do this really difficult thing. You discover</p>
<p>something very new. You discover something about robotics. You discover something about</p>
<p>materials engineering or nutrition or neuroscience or human relations or political systems that</p>
<p>actually work well with humans. You discover all those things. And so it&rsquo;s a worthy effort to go</p>
<p>out there and try to become cyborgs. Yeah, no, I agree with that. I think the only different point</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d make is that this is going to be very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very,</p>
<p>very expensive if it&rsquo;s done in a risk averse way. And that&rsquo;s why I think we should be grateful to</p>
<p>the billionaires if they&rsquo;re going to sort of foster these opportunities for thrill seeking</p>
<p>risk takers who we can all admire. Yeah. By the way, I should push back on the billionaires</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s sometimes a negative connotation to the word billionaire. It&rsquo;s not a billionaire.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a company versus government because governments are billionaires and trillionaires.</p>
<p>Yeah. It&rsquo;s not the wealth. It&rsquo;s the capitalist imperative, which I think</p>
<p>deserves a lot more praise than people are giving it. I&rsquo;m troubled by the sort of criticism like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s billionaires playing with toys for their own pleasure. I think what some of these companies</p>
<p>like SpaceX and Blue Origin are doing is some of the most inspiring engineering and even scientific</p>
<p>work ever done in human history. No, I agree. I think the people who&rsquo;ve made the greatest wealth</p>
<p>are people who&rsquo;ve really been mega benefactors. I mean, I think, you know.</p>
<p>Some of them, some of them. Yeah, yes, some of them. But those who&rsquo;ve founded Google and all</p>
<p>that and even Amazon, they&rsquo;re beneficiaries. They&rsquo;re in a quite different category, in my view,</p>
<p>from those who just shuffle around money or crypto coins and things like that.</p>
<p>Now you&rsquo;re really talking trash.</p>
<p>Yes. But I think if they use their money in these ways, that&rsquo;s fine. But I think it&rsquo;s true that far</p>
<p>more money is owned by us collectively as taxpayers. But I think the fact is that in a democracy,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;d be big resistance to exposing human beings to very high risks if in a sense we</p>
<p>share responsibility for it. And that&rsquo;s the reason I think it would be done much more cheaply by</p>
<p>these private funders.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an interesting hypothesis, but I have to push back. I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s obvious</p>
<p>why NASA spends so much money and takes such a long time to develop the things it was doing.</p>
<p>So before Elon Musk came along, because I would love to live in a world where government</p>
<p>actually uses taxpayer money to get some of the best engineers and scientists in the world</p>
<p>and actually work across governments, Russia, China, United States, European Union together</p>
<p>to do some of these big projects. It&rsquo;s strange that Elon is able to do this much cheaper,</p>
<p>much faster. It could have to do with risk aversion, you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>But I think it&rsquo;s that he had all the whole assembly within this one building as it were,</p>
<p>rather than depending on a supply chain. But I think it&rsquo;s also that he had a Silicon Valley</p>
<p>culture and had younger people, whereas the big aerospace companies, Boeing and Lockheed Martin,</p>
<p>they had people who were left over from the Apollo program in some cases. And so they weren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>quite so lively. And indeed, quite apart from the controversial issues of the future of human</p>
<p>spaceflight, in terms of the next generation of big rockets, then the one that Musk is going to</p>
<p>launch for the first time this year, the huge one, is going to be far, far cheaper than the</p>
<p>one that NASA has been working on at the same time. And that&rsquo;s because it will have a reusable</p>
<p>first stage. And it&rsquo;s going to be great. It can launch over 100 tons into Earth orbit. And</p>
<p>incidentally, that&rsquo;s going to make it feasible to do things that I used to think were crazy,</p>
<p>like having solar energy from space. That&rsquo;s no longer so crazy if you can do that. And also,</p>
<p>for science, because its nose cone could contain within it something as big as the entire unfurled</p>
<p>James Webb telescope mirror. And therefore, you can have a big telescope much more cheaply if you</p>
<p>can launch it all in one piece. And so it&rsquo;s going to be hugely beneficial to science and to any</p>
<p>practical use of space to have these cheaper rockets that are far more completely reusable</p>
<p>than anyways NASA had. So I think Musk&rsquo;s done a tremendous service to space exploration and the</p>
<p>whole space technology through these rockets, certainly. Plus, it&rsquo;s some big sexy rocket.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just great engineering. Of course, yeah. It&rsquo;s like looking at a beautiful big bridge</p>
<p>that humans are capable. Us descendants of apes are capable to do something so majestic.</p>
<p>Yes. And also the way they land coming down on this bar. That&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s both controls engineering. It&rsquo;s increasing sort of intelligence in these rockets, but also</p>
<p>great propulsion engineering materials, entrepreneurship. And it just inspires so</p>
<p>many people. No, I&rsquo;m entirely with you on that. So would it be exciting to you to see a human</p>
<p>being step foot on Mars in your lifetime? Yes, I think it&rsquo;s unlikely in my lifetime</p>
<p>since I&rsquo;m so ancient. But I think this century, it&rsquo;s going to happen. And I think that will</p>
<p>indeed be exciting. And I hope there will be a small community by the end of a century.</p>
<p>But as I say, I think they may go with one way tickets or accepting the risk of no return.</p>
<p>And so they&rsquo;ve got to be people like that. And I still think it&rsquo;s going to be hard to persuade</p>
<p>the public to send people when you say straight out that they may never come back. But of course,</p>
<p>the Apollo astronauts, they took a high risk. And in fact, in my previous book, I quote the</p>
<p>speech that has been written for Nixon to be read out if Neil Armstrong got stuck on the moon.</p>
<p>And it was written by one of his advisors and very eloquent speech about how they have come</p>
<p>to a noble end, et cetera. But of course, there was a genuine risk at that time. But that may have</p>
<p>been accepted. But clearly, the crashes of the shuttle were not acceptable to the American</p>
<p>public, even when they were told that this was only a 2% risk given how often they launched it.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s what leads me to think that it&rsquo;s got to be left to the kind of people who are</p>
<p>prepared to take these risks. And I think of American Avengers, there was a guy called Steve</p>
<p>Fossett who was an aviator who did all kinds of crazy things. And then a guy who fell</p>
<p>supersonically with a parachute from very high altitude. All these people, we all share them on.</p>
<p>They extend the bounds of humanity. But I don&rsquo;t think the public will be so happy to fund them.</p>
<p>I mean, I disagree with that. I think if we change the narrative, we should change the story.</p>
<p>You think so?</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a lot of people&hellip; Because the public is happy to fund folks in other domains</p>
<p>that take bold, giant risks. First of all, military, for example.</p>
<p>Oh, in the military, obviously, yes.</p>
<p>I think this is, in the name of science, especially if it&rsquo;s sold correctly, I sure as hell would go</p>
<p>up there with a risk&hellip; I would take a 40% chance risk of death for something that&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>I would. I might want to be even older than I am now. But then I would go.</p>
<p>I guess what I&rsquo;m trying to communicate is there&rsquo;s a lot of people on Earth. That&rsquo;s the nice feature</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s going to be a significant percentage or some percentage of people that are&hellip;</p>
<p>They take on the risk for the adventure. So, and I particularly love that that risk of adventure</p>
<p>when taking on inspires people and just the ripple effect it has across the generation,</p>
<p>especially among the young minds, is perhaps immeasurable. But you&rsquo;re thinking that sending</p>
<p>humans should be something we do less and less, sending humans to space. That it should be</p>
<p>primarily an effort. The work of space exploration should be done primarily by robots.</p>
<p>Well, I think it can be done much more cheaply, obviously, on Mars. And no one&rsquo;s thinking of</p>
<p>sending humans to Enceladus or Europa, the outer planets. And the point is we will have much better</p>
<p>robots. Because let&rsquo;s take an example. You&rsquo;ve seen the pictures of the moons of Saturn and the</p>
<p>picture of Pluto and the comet taken by probes and Cassini spent 13 years going around Saturn and</p>
<p>its moons after seven year voyage. And those are all based on 1990s technology. And if you think</p>
<p>of how smartphones have advanced in the 20 years since then, just think how much better one could</p>
<p>do instrumenting some very small, sophisticated probe. You could send dozens of them to explore</p>
<p>the outer planets. And that&rsquo;s the way to do that. Because no one thinks you could send humans that</p>
<p>far. But I would apply the same argument to Mars. And if you want to assemble big structures like,</p>
<p>for instance, radio astronomers would like to have a big radio telescope on the far side of the moon</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s away from the Earth&rsquo;s background artificial radio waves. And that could be</p>
<p>done by assembling using robots without people. So on the moon and on Mars, I think</p>
<p>everything that&rsquo;s useful can be done by machines much more cheaper than by humans.</p>
<p>Do you know the movie 2001 A Space Odyssey?</p>
<p>Of course, yes. You must be too young to have seen that when it came out, obviously.</p>
<p>I remember seeing it when it came out.</p>
<p>You saw it when it came out.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, 50 years ago.</p>
<p>60, when was it? 60, in the 60s.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s right. Still a classic.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s still probably, for me, the greatest AI movie ever made.</p>
<p>Yes, yes, I agree.</p>
<p>One of the great space movies ever made.</p>
<p>Yes. Well, let me ask you a philosophical question. Since we&rsquo;re talking about robots</p>
<p>exploring space, do you think HAL 9000 is good or bad? So for people who haven&rsquo;t watched,</p>
<p>this computer system makes a decision to basically prioritize the mission that</p>
<p>the ship is on over the humans that are part of the mission. Do you think HAL is good or evil?</p>
<p>If you ask me, probably in that context, it was probably good. But I think you&rsquo;re raising</p>
<p>what is, of course, very much an active issue in everyday life about the extent to which we should</p>
<p>entrust any important decision to a machine. And there again, I&rsquo;m very worried, because I think</p>
<p>if you are recommended for an operation or not given parole from prison or even denied credit</p>
<p>by your bank, you feel you should be entitled to an explanation. It&rsquo;s not enough to be told that</p>
<p>the machine has a more reliable record on the whole than humans have of making these decisions.</p>
<p>You think you should be given reasons you could understand. And that&rsquo;s why I think the present</p>
<p>societal trend to take away the humans and leave us in the hands of decisions that we can&rsquo;t contest</p>
<p>is a very dangerous one. I think we&rsquo;ve got to be very careful of the extent to which AI,</p>
<p>which can handle lots of information, actually makes the decision without oversight. And I think</p>
<p>we can use them as a supplement. But to take the case of radiology and cancer,</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s true that the radiologist hasn&rsquo;t seen as many x rays of cancer lungs as the machine. So</p>
<p>the machine could certainly help, but you want the human to make the final decision. And I think</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s true in most of these instances. But if we turn a bit to the short term concerns with</p>
<p>robotics, I think the big worry, of course, is the effect it has on people&rsquo;s self respect and</p>
<p>their labor market. And I think my solution would be that we should arrange to tax more heavily</p>
<p>the big international conglomerates, which use the robots and use that tax to fund</p>
<p>decently paid, dignified posts of the kind where being a human being is important.</p>
<p>Above all, carers for old people, teachers assistants for young, gardens in public parks,</p>
<p>and things like that. And if the people who are now working in mind numbing jobs in Amazon</p>
<p>warehouses, or in telephone call centers, are automated, but those same people are given</p>
<p>jobs where being a human is an asset, then that&rsquo;s a plus plus situation. And so that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the way I think that we should benefit from these technologies, take over the mind numbing jobs,</p>
<p>and use machines to make them more efficient, but enable the people so displaced to do jobs</p>
<p>where we do want a human being. I mean, most people when they&rsquo;re old, they&rsquo;re rich people</p>
<p>if they have the choice. They want human carers and all that, don&rsquo;t they? They may want robots</p>
<p>to help with some things, empty the bed pans and things like that, but they want real people. And</p>
<p>certainly in this country, I think even worse in America, the care of old people is completely</p>
<p>inadequate. And it needs just more human beings to help them cope with everyday life and look after</p>
<p>them when they&rsquo;re sick. And so that seems to be the way in which the money raised in tax from</p>
<p>these big companies should be deployed. So that&rsquo;s in the short term, but if you actually just look,</p>
<p>the fact is where we are today to longterm future in a hundred years, it does seem that</p>
<p>there is some significant chance that the human species is coming to an end in its</p>
<p>pure biological form. There&rsquo;s going to be greater and greater integration</p>
<p>through genetic modification and cyborg type of creatures. And so you have to think, all right,</p>
<p>well, we&rsquo;re going to have to get from here to there and that process is going to be painful.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s so many different trajectories that take us from one place to another.</p>
<p>It does seem that we need to deeply respect humanness and humanity, basic human rights,</p>
<p>human welfare, like happiness and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>No, absolutely. And that&rsquo;s why I think we ought to try and slow down the application of these</p>
<p>human enhancement techniques and cyborg techniques for humans for just that reason. I mean,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why I want to lead into the people on Mars, let them do it, but for just that reason.</p>
<p>But there are people too. Okay. People on Mars are people too. I tend to, you know.</p>
<p>But they are very poorly adapted to where they are. That&rsquo;s why they need this modification,</p>
<p>whereas we&rsquo;re adapted to the Earth quite well. So we don&rsquo;t need these modifications. We&rsquo;re</p>
<p>happy to be humans living in the environment where our ancestors lived. So we don&rsquo;t have the same</p>
<p>motive. So I think there&rsquo;s a difference. But I agree, we don&rsquo;t want drastic changes probably in</p>
<p>our lifestyle. And that indeed is a worry because some things are changing so fast.</p>
<p>But I think I&rsquo;d like to inject a note of caution. If you think of the way progress in one technology</p>
<p>goes, it goes in a sort of spurt. It goes up very fast and then it levels off. Let me give you</p>
<p>two examples. One we&rsquo;ve had already, a human space flight. At the time of the Apollo program,</p>
<p>which was only 12 years after Sputnik 1, I was alive then. And I thought it would only be 10</p>
<p>or 20 years further before there were footprints on Mars. But as we know, for reasons we could all</p>
<p>understand, that still remains the high point of human space exploration. That&rsquo;s because it was</p>
<p>funded for reasons of superpower rivalry at huge public expense. But let me give you another case,</p>
<p>civil aviation. If you think of the change between 1919, when that was Alcock and Brown&rsquo;s first</p>
<p>transatlantic fight, to 1979, the first flight of the jumbo jet. It was a big change. But it&rsquo;s more</p>
<p>than 50 years since 1969. And we still have jumbo jets more or less the same. So that&rsquo;s an example</p>
<p>of something which developed fast. And to take another analogy, we&rsquo;ve had huge developments in</p>
<p>mobile phones. But I suspect the iPhone 24 may not be too different from the iPhone 13.</p>
<p>They develop, but then they saturate, and then maybe some new innovation takes over</p>
<p>in stimulating economic growth. Yeah, so it&rsquo;s that we have to be cautious about being too optimistic,</p>
<p>and we have to be cautious about being too cynical. I think that is the</p>
<p>optimistic is begging the question. I mean, do we want this rapid change?</p>
<p>Right. So first of all, there&rsquo;s some degree to which technological advancement is something,</p>
<p>is a force that can&rsquo;t be stopped. And so the question is about directing it versus stopping it</p>
<p>or slowing it. Well, it can be sort of sloped or slow. We&rsquo;ll take human spaceflight. There could</p>
<p>have been footprints on Mars if America had gone on spending 4% of the federal budget on the project</p>
<p>after Apollo. There were very good reasons, and we could have had supersonic flight, but Concorde</p>
<p>came and went during the 50 years. But the reason it didn&rsquo;t progress is not because we realize it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not good for human society. The reason it didn&rsquo;t progress is because it couldn&rsquo;t make,</p>
<p>sort of from a capitalist perspective, it couldn&rsquo;t make, there was no short term or long term way for</p>
<p>it to make money. So for me, it isn&rsquo;t, but that&rsquo;s the same as saying it&rsquo;s not good for society.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think everything that makes money is good for society and everything that doesn&rsquo;t make money</p>
<p>is bad for society, right? That&rsquo;s a difficult thing we&rsquo;re always contending with.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a difficult thing we&rsquo;re always contending with when we look at social networks. It&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>obvious, even though they make a tremendous amount of money, that they&rsquo;re good for society,</p>
<p>especially how they&rsquo;re currently implemented with advertisement and engagement maximization.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the constant struggle.</p>
<p>But I would have thought that supersonic flight was something that would benefit only a tiny</p>
<p>elite at a huge expense and environmental damage. That was obviously something which we&rsquo;re very</p>
<p>glad not to have, in my opinion.</p>
<p>Yeah, but perhaps there was a way to do it where it could benefit the general populace.</p>
<p>If you were to think about airplanes, wouldn&rsquo;t you think that in the early days, airplanes would</p>
<p>have been seen as something that can surely only benefit 1% at most of the population,</p>
<p>as opposed to a much larger percentage? There&rsquo;s another aspect of capitalist system that&rsquo;s able</p>
<p>to drive down costs once you get the thing kind of going. So we get together maybe with taxpayer</p>
<p>money and get the thing going at first. And once it gets going, companies step up and drive down</p>
<p>the cost and actually make it so that blue collar folks can actually start using the stuff.</p>
<p>Yeah, sometimes that does happen. That&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>Yeah. So that&rsquo;s, again, the double edged sword of human civilization, that some technology</p>
<p>hurts us, some benefits us, and we don&rsquo;t know ahead of time. We can just do our best.</p>
<p>Yes. There&rsquo;s a gap between what could be done and what we collectively decide to do.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And it could push forward some developments faster than we do.</p>
<p>Let me ask you, in your book on the future prospects for humanity,</p>
<p>you imagine a time machine that allows you to send a tweet length message to scientists in</p>
<p>the past, like to Newton. What tweet would you send? It&rsquo;s an interesting thought experiment.</p>
<p>What message would you send to Newton about what we know today?</p>
<p>Well, I think he&rsquo;d love to know that there were planets around other stars. He&rsquo;d like to know</p>
<p>that everything was made of atoms. He&rsquo;d like to know that if he looked a bit more carefully</p>
<p>through his prisms and looked at light, not just from the sun, but from some flames,</p>
<p>he might get the idea that different substances emitted light of different colors, and he might</p>
<p>have been twigged to discover some things that had to wait 200 or 300 years. Could have given him</p>
<p>those clues, I think. It&rsquo;s fascinating to think, to look back at how little</p>
<p>he understood, people at that time understood about our world.</p>
<p>Yes. And certainly about the cosmos.</p>
<p>About the cosmos, yes.</p>
<p>Well, if you think about astronomy, then until about 1850, astronomy was a matter of</p>
<p>the positions of how the stars and the planets moved around. Of course, that goes back a long</p>
<p>way, but Newton understood why the planets moved around in ellipses. But he didn&rsquo;t understand</p>
<p>why the solar system was all in a plane, what we call the ecliptic, and he didn&rsquo;t understand it.</p>
<p>No one did until the mid 19th century what the stars are made of. I mean, they were thought to</p>
<p>be made of some fifth essence, not earth, air, fire, and water like everything else,</p>
<p>and it was only after 1850 when people did use prisms more precisely to get spectra that they</p>
<p>realized that the sun was made of the same stuff as the earth, and indeed the stars were. It wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>until 1930 that people knew about nuclear energy and knew what kept the sun shining for so long.</p>
<p>So it was quite late that some of these key ideas came in, which would have completely</p>
<p>transformed Newton&rsquo;s views, and of course, the entire scale of the galaxy and the rest of the</p>
<p>universe. Just imagine what he would have thought about the Big Bang, or even just general</p>
<p>relativity, just gravity, just him and Einstein talking for a couple weeks. Would he be able to</p>
<p>make sense of space time and the curvature of space time? Well, I think given a quick course,</p>
<p>I mean, he was sort of, if one looks back, he was really a unique intellect in a way,</p>
<p>you know, and he said that he thought better than everyone else by thinking on things continually,</p>
<p>and thinking very deep thoughts, and so he was an utterly remarkable intellect, obviously.</p>
<p>But of course, scientists aren&rsquo;t all like that. I think one thing that&rsquo;s interesting to me,</p>
<p>having spent a life among scientists, is what a variety of mindsets and mental styles they have.</p>
<p>And just to contrast Newton and Darwin, Darwin said, and he&rsquo;s probably correct, that he thought</p>
<p>he just had as much common sense and reasoning power as the average lawyer. And that&rsquo;s probably</p>
<p>true because his ability was to sort of collect data and think through things deeply. That&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>quite different kind of thinking from what was involved in Newton or someone doing abstract</p>
<p>mathematics. I think in the 20th century, the coolest, well, there&rsquo;s the theory, but</p>
<p>from an astronomy perspective, black holes is one of the most fascinating entities to have been,</p>
<p>through theory and through experiment, to have emerged from. Obviously, I agree. It&rsquo;s an amazing</p>
<p>story. Well, of course, what&rsquo;s interesting is Einstein&rsquo;s reaction because, as you know,</p>
<p>we now accept this is one of the most remarkable predictions of Einstein&rsquo;s theory. He never took</p>
<p>it seriously, even believed it, although it was a consequence of a solution of his equations,</p>
<p>which someone discovered just a year after his theory, Schwarzschild. But he never took it</p>
<p>seriously, and others did. But then, of course, well, this is something that I&rsquo;ve been involved</p>
<p>in actually finding evidence for black holes, and that&rsquo;s come in the last 50 years. So now,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s pretty compelling evidence that they exist as the remnants of stars or big ones in</p>
<p>the center of galaxies. And we understand what&rsquo;s going on. We have ideas, vaguely on how they form.</p>
<p>And, of course, gravitational waves have been detected, and that&rsquo;s an amazing piece of technology.</p>
<p>Ligo is one of the most incredible engineering efforts of all time.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an example where the engineers deserve most of the credit because the precision is,</p>
<p>as I said, it&rsquo;s like measuring the thickness of a hair at the distance of Alpha Centauri.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s incredible.</p>
<p>Tens to minus 21.</p>
<p>So maybe, actually, if we step back, what are black holes? What do we humans understand about</p>
<p>black holes and what&rsquo;s still unknown?</p>
<p>Einstein&rsquo;s theory, extended by people like Roger Penrose, tells us that black holes are,</p>
<p>in a sense, rather simple things, basically, because they are solutions of Einstein&rsquo;s equations.</p>
<p>And the thing that was shown in the 1960s by Roger Penrose in particular, and by a few other</p>
<p>people, was that a black hole, when it forms and settles down, is defined just by two quantities,</p>
<p>its mass and its spin. So they&rsquo;re actually very standardized objects. It&rsquo;s amazing that objects</p>
<p>as standardized as that can be so big and can lurk in the rest of the solar system.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s the situation for a ready formed black hole. But the way they form, obviously,</p>
<p>is very messy and complicated. And one of the things that I&rsquo;ve worked on a lot is what the</p>
<p>phenomena are, which are best attributed to black holes, and what may lead to them, and all that.</p>
<p>Which, can you explain to that? So what are the different phenomena</p>
<p>that lead to a black hole? Let&rsquo;s talk about it. This is so cool.</p>
<p>Oh, okay. Well, I think one thing that only became understood, really,</p>
<p>in the 1950s, I suppose, and beyond was how stars evolve differently depending on how</p>
<p>heavy they are. The sun burns hydrogen to helium, and then when it&rsquo;s run out of that,</p>
<p>it contracts to be a white dwarf. And we know how long that will take. It&rsquo;ll take about 10 billion</p>
<p>years altogether for its lifetime. But big stars burn up their fuel more quickly, and more</p>
<p>interestingly, because when they&rsquo;ve turned hydrogen to helium, they then get even hotter,</p>
<p>so they can fuse helium into carbon and go up the periodic table. And then they eventually</p>
<p>explode when they have an energy crisis, and they blow out that process material,</p>
<p>which, as a digression, is crucially important because all the atoms inside our bodies</p>
<p>were synthesized inside a star, a star that lived and died more than five billion years ago</p>
<p>before our solar system formed. And so we each have inside us atoms made in thousands of different</p>
<p>stars all over the Milky Way, and that&rsquo;s an amazing idea. My predecessor, Fred Hoyle,</p>
<p>in 1946 was the first person to suggest that idea, and that&rsquo;s been borne out. That&rsquo;s a wonderful</p>
<p>idea. So that&rsquo;s how massive stars explode. And they leave behind something which is very exotic</p>
<p>of two kinds. One possibility is a neutron star, and these were first discovered in 1967,</p>
<ol start="68">
<li>These are stars a bit heavier than the sun, which are compressed to an amazing density,</li>
</ol>
<p>so the whole mass of more than the sun&rsquo;s mass is in something about 10 miles across.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re extraordinarily dense, they&rsquo;re exotic physics, and they&rsquo;ve been studied in immense</p>
<p>detail. And they&rsquo;ve been real laboratories because the good thing about astronomy, apart from</p>
<p>exploring what&rsquo;s out there, is to use the fact that the cosmos has provided us with a lab</p>
<p>with far more extreme conditions than we could ever simulate. And so we learn lots of basic</p>
<p>physics from looking at these objects, and that&rsquo;s been true of neutron stars. But for black holes,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s even more true because the bigger stars, when they collapse, they leave something behind</p>
<p>in the center which is too big to be a stable white 2 or 4 neutron star and becomes a black hole.</p>
<p>And we know that there are lots of black holes weighing about 10 or up to 50 times as much as the</p>
<p>sun, which are the remnants of stars. They were detected first 50 years ago, when a black hole</p>
<p>was orbiting around another star and grabbing material from the other star which swirled into</p>
<p>it and gave us X rays. So the X rays astronomers found these objects orbiting around an ordinary</p>
<p>star and emitting X ray radiation very intensely, varying on a very short time scale. So something</p>
<p>very small and dense was giving that radiation. That was the first evidence for black holes.</p>
<p>But then the other thing that happened was realizing that there was a different class</p>
<p>of monster black holes in the centers of galaxies. And these are responsible for what&rsquo;s called</p>
<p>quasars, which is when something in the center of a galaxy is grabbing some fuel and outshines all</p>
<p>the hundred billion stars or so in the rest of the galaxy. A giant beam of light. And in many</p>
<p>cases, it&rsquo;s a beam of&hellip; That&rsquo;s got to be the most epic thing the universe produces is quasars.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s a debate about what&rsquo;s the most epic, but quasars maybe or maybe gamma ray bursts or</p>
<p>something, but they are remarkable and they were a mystery for a long time. And they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>one of the things I worked on in my younger days. So even though they&rsquo;re so bright,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re still a mystery and you can only see them. I think they&rsquo;re less of a mystery now.</p>
<p>I think we do understand basically what&rsquo;s going on. How were quasars discovered?</p>
<p>Well, they were discovered when astronomers found things that looked like stars and that they were</p>
<p>small enough to be a point like and not resolved by a telescope, but outshone an entire galaxy.</p>
<p>Yeah. That&rsquo;s suspicious.</p>
<p>Yes. But then they realized that what they were, they were objects which you now know are black</p>
<p>holes and black holes were capturing gas and that gas was getting very hot, but it was producing</p>
<p>far more energy than all the stars added together. And it was the energy of the black hole that was</p>
<p>lighting up all the gas in the galaxy. So you&rsquo;ve got a spectrum of it there. So this was something</p>
<p>which was realized from the 1970s onwards. And as you say, the other thing we&rsquo;ve learned is that</p>
<p>they often do produce these jets squirting out, which could be detected in all wave bands. So</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s now a standard picture.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a giant black hole generating jets of light at the center of most galaxies.</p>
<p>Yes. That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Do we know, do we have a sense if every galaxy has one of these big boys, big black holes?</p>
<p>Most galaxies have big black holes. They vary in size. The one in our galactic center.</p>
<p>Do we know much about ours?</p>
<p>We do. Yes. We know it weighs about as much as 4 million suns, which is less than some,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s several billion other galaxies. But we know this one in our galactic center</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t very bright or conspicuous. And that&rsquo;s because not much is falling into it at the</p>
<p>moment. If a black hole is isolated, then of course it doesn&rsquo;t radiate. All that radiates</p>
<p>is gas swirling into it, which is very hot or has magnetic fields.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s only radiating the thing it&rsquo;s murdering or consuming, however you put it.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s right. And so it&rsquo;s thought that our galaxy may have been bright at some time</p>
<p>in the past, but now that&rsquo;s when the black hole formed or grew. But now it&rsquo;s not capturing</p>
<p>very much gas. And so it&rsquo;s rather faint and detected indirectly and by fairly weak radio</p>
<p>emission. And so I think the answer to your question is that we suspect that most galaxies</p>
<p>have a black hole in them. So that means at some stage in their lives, or maybe one or</p>
<p>more stages, they went through a phase of being like a quasar where that black hole</p>
<p>captured gas and became very, very bright. But for the rest of their lives, the black</p>
<p>holes are fairly quiescent because there&rsquo;s not much gas falling into them.</p>
<p>And so this universe of ours is sprinkled with a bunch of galaxies and giant black holes with</p>
<p>very large number of stars orbiting these black holes and then planets orbiting.</p>
<p>Likely, it seems like planets orbiting almost every one of those stars and just this beautiful</p>
<p>universe of ours. Well, what happens when galaxies collide, when these two big black holes</p>
<p>collide? Well, what would happen is that&hellip; Well, and I should say that this is going to happen</p>
<p>near us one day, but not for 4 billion years because the Andromeda galaxy, which is the</p>
<p>biggest galaxy near to us, which is about nearly 3 million light years away, which is a big disk</p>
<p>galaxy with a black hole in its hub, rather like our Milky Way. And that&rsquo;s falling towards us</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re both in a common gravitational potential well. And that will collide with our</p>
<p>galaxy in about 4 billion years. But maybe it&rsquo;ll be less a collision and more of a dance because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll be like a swirling situation. But eventually, there&rsquo;ll be a merger. They&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>go through each other and then merge. In fact, there are nice movies to be made of this,</p>
<p>computer simulations, and it&rsquo;ll go through. And then there&rsquo;s a black hole in the center of</p>
<p>Andromeda and our galaxy. And the black holes will settle towards the center. Then they will</p>
<p>orbit around each other very fast, and then they will eventually merge. And that&rsquo;ll produce a big</p>
<p>burst of gravitational waves, a very big burst. That an alien civilization with a LIGO like</p>
<p>detector will be able to detect. Yes. Well, in fact, we can detect these</p>
<p>with their lower frequencies than the ways that will be detected by LIGO. So there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>spatial interferometer which can detect these. It&rsquo;s about one cycle per hour rather than about</p>
<p>100 cycles per second. It&rsquo;s the ones that detect it. But that will happen. But thinking back to</p>
<p>what will happen in 4 billion years to any of our descendants, they&rsquo;ll be okay because the two disk</p>
<p>galaxies will merge. It&rsquo;ll end up as a sort of amorphous elliptical galaxy. But the stars won&rsquo;t</p>
<p>be much closer together than they are now. It&rsquo;ll still be just twice as many stars in a structure</p>
<p>almost as big. And so the chance of another star colliding with our sun would still be very small.</p>
<p>Because there&rsquo;s actually a lot of space between stars and planets.</p>
<p>Yes, the chance of a star getting close enough to affect our solar system&rsquo;s orbit</p>
<p>is small. And it won&rsquo;t change that very much. So you could be reassured.</p>
<p>A heck of a starry sky though. What would that look like?</p>
<p>Well, it won&rsquo;t make much difference even to that actually. It&rsquo;ll just be&hellip;</p>
<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t that look kind of beautiful when you&rsquo;re swirling? Oh, because it&rsquo;s swirling so slowly.</p>
<p>Yeah, but they&rsquo;re far away. So it&rsquo;ll be twice as many stars in the sky.</p>
<p>Yeah, but the pattern changes in interesting ways.</p>
<p>Yeah, the pattern will change a bit. And there won&rsquo;t be the Milky Way because the Milky Way</p>
<p>across the sky is because we are looking in the disk of our galaxy. And you lose that.</p>
<p>And because the disk will be so disrupted. And it&rsquo;ll be a more sort of spherical distribution.</p>
<p>And of course, many galaxies are like that. And that&rsquo;s probably because they have been through</p>
<p>mergers of this kind. If we survive four billion years,</p>
<p>we would likely be able to survive beyond that. Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the other thing on the horizon for humans in terms of the sun burning out,</p>
<p>all those kinds of interesting cosmological threats to our civilization?</p>
<p>Well, I think on the cosmological time scale, because it won&rsquo;t be humans, because even if</p>
<p>evolution is no faster than Darwinian, and I would argue it will be faster than Darwinian</p>
<p>in the future, then we&rsquo;re thinking about six billion years before the sun dies. So any</p>
<p>entities watching the death of the sun, if they&rsquo;re still around, they&rsquo;ll be as different</p>
<p>from much as we are from slime mold or something. And far more different still if they become</p>
<p>electronic. So on that time scale, we just can&rsquo;t predict anything. But I think going back to</p>
<p>the human time scale, then we&rsquo;ve talked about whether there&rsquo;ll be people on Mars by the end</p>
<p>of a century. And even in these long perspectives, then indeed, this century is very special,</p>
<p>because it may see the transition between purely flesh and blood entities to those which are sort</p>
<p>of cyborgs. And that&rsquo;ll be an important transition in the future.</p>
<p>But of course, the other importance, and this has been the theme of a couple of my older books,</p>
<p>is that this is the first century when one species, namely our species, has the future of</p>
<p>the planet in its hands. And that&rsquo;s because of two types of concerns. One is that there are more</p>
<p>of us where more of us are living in the past, and the other is that there are more of us who are</p>
<p>living in the future. So those are two concerns. One is that there are more of us where more</p>
<p>demanding of energy and resources, and therefore we are for the first time changing the whole</p>
<p>planet through climate change, loss of biodiversity, and all those issues. This has never</p>
<p>happened in the past, because there haven&rsquo;t been enough humans. So this is an effect that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>now, and rightly so, because we&rsquo;ve got to ensure that we leave a heritage that isn&rsquo;t eroded or</p>
<p>damaged to future generations. And so that&rsquo;s one class of threats.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s another thing that worries me, perhaps more than many people seem to worry,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s the threat of misuse of technology. And so this is particularly because technologies</p>
<p>empower even small groups of malevolent people, or indeed even careless people, to create some</p>
<p>effect which could cascade globally. And to take an example, a dangerous pathogen or pandemic,</p>
<p>I mean, my worst nightmare is that there could be some small group that can engineer a virus</p>
<p>to make it more variant or more transmissible than a natural virus. This is a gain of function</p>
<p>experiments which were done on the flu virus 10 years ago and can be done for others.</p>
<p>And of course, we now know from COVID 19 that our world is so interconnected that a disaster in one</p>
<p>part of the world can&rsquo;t be confined to that part and will spread globally. So it&rsquo;s possible for</p>
<p>a few dissidents with expertise in biotech could create a global catastrophe of that kind.</p>
<p>And also, I think we need to worry about very large scale disruption by cyber attacks and</p>
<p>in fact, I quote in one of my books, a 2012 report from the American Pentagon about the possibility</p>
<p>of a state level cyber attack on the electricity grid in Eastern United States, which is it could</p>
<p>happen. And it says at the end of this chapter that this would merit a nuclear response. This</p>
<p>is a pretty scary possibility. And that was 10 years ago. And I think now what would have needed</p>
<p>a state actor then could be done perhaps by a small group empowered by AI. And so there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>obviously been an arms race between the cyber criminals and the cyber security people. Not</p>
<p>clear which side is winning. But the main point is that as we become more dependent on more</p>
<p>integrated systems, then we get more vulnerable. And so we have the knowledge, then the misuse of</p>
<p>that knowledge becomes more and more of a threat. And I&rsquo;d say bio and cyber are the two biggest</p>
<p>concerns. And if we depend too much on AI and complex systems, then just breakdowns, it may be</p>
<p>that they break down. And even if it&rsquo;s an innocent breakdown, then it may be pretty hard to mend it.</p>
<p>And just think how much worse the pandemic would have been if we&rsquo;d lost the internet in the middle</p>
<p>of it. We&rsquo;d be dependent more than ever for communication and everything else on the internet</p>
<p>and Zooms and all that. And if that had broken down, that would have made things far worse. And</p>
<p>those are the kinds of threats that we, I think, need to be more energized and politicians need to</p>
<p>be more energized to minimize. And one of the things I&rsquo;ve been doing in the last year through</p>
<p>being a member of our part of our parliament is I have to instigate a committee to think more on</p>
<p>better preparedness for extreme technological risks and things like that. So they&rsquo;re a big</p>
<p>concern in my mind that we&rsquo;ve got to make sure that we can benefit from these advances but safely</p>
<p>because the stakes are getting higher and the benefits are getting great, as we know, huge</p>
<p>benefits from computers, but also huge downsides as well. And one of the things this war in Ukraine</p>
<p>has shown, one of the most terrifying things outside of the humanitarian crisis, is that at</p>
<p>least for me, I realized that the human capacity to initiate nuclear war is greater than I thought.</p>
<p>I thought the lessons of the past have been learned. It seems that we hang on the brink of</p>
<p>nuclear war with this conflict like every single day with just one mistake or bad actor or the</p>
<p>actual leaders of the particular nations launching a nuclear strike and all hell breaks loose. So</p>
<p>then add into that picture, cyber attacks and so on, that can lead to confusion and chaos. And then</p>
<p>out of that confusion, calculations are made such that a nuclear weapon is launched and then</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re talking about, I mean, it directs probably 60, 70% of humans on Earth are dead instantly.</p>
<p>And then the rest, I mean, it&rsquo;s basically 99% of the human population is wiped out in the period</p>
<p>of five years. Well, it may not be that bad, but it will be a devastation for civilization,</p>
<p>of course. And of course, you were quite right that this could happen very quickly because of</p>
<p>information coming in and there&rsquo;s hardly enough time for human collected and careful thought.</p>
<p>And there have been recorded cases of false alarms. There&rsquo;s several where there have been</p>
<p>suspected attacks from the other side. And fortunately, they&rsquo;ve been really false alarm</p>
<p>soon enough, but this could happen. And there&rsquo;s a new class of threats actually, which in our</p>
<p>center in Cambridge, people are thinking about, which is that the commander control system</p>
<p>of the nuclear weapons and the submarine fleet and all that is now more automated and could be</p>
<p>subject to cyber attacks. And that&rsquo;s a new threat which didn&rsquo;t exist 30 years ago. And so I think</p>
<p>indeed, we&rsquo;re in a sort of scary world, I think. And it&rsquo;s because things happen faster and human</p>
<p>beings aren&rsquo;t in such direct and immediate control because so much is delegated to machines. And</p>
<p>also because the world is so much more interconnected, then some local event can cascade</p>
<p>globally in a way it never could in the past and much faster.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s a double edged sword because the interconnectedness brings a higher quality of</p>
<p>life across a lot of metrics.</p>
<p>Yeah, it can do. But of course, there again, I mean, if you think of supply chains where we</p>
<p>get stuff from around the world, then one lesson we&rsquo;ve learned is that there&rsquo;s a trade off between</p>
<p>resilience and efficiency and it&rsquo;s resilient to have an inventory in stock and to depend on local</p>
<p>supplies, whereas they&rsquo;re more efficient to have long supply chains. But the risk there is that a</p>
<p>break in one link in one chain can screw up car production. This has already happened in the</p>
<p>pandemic. So there&rsquo;s a trade off. And there are other examples. I mean, for instance, the other</p>
<p>thing we learned was that it may be efficient to have 95% of your hospital intensive care beds</p>
<p>occupied all the time, which has been the UK situation, whereas to do what the Germans do and</p>
<p>always keep 20% of them free for an emergency is really a sensible precaution. And so I think</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve probably learned a lot of lessons from COVID 19. And they would include rebalancing the</p>
<p>trade off between resilience and efficiency.</p>
<p>Boy, the fact that COVID 19, a pandemic that could have been a lot, a lot worse,</p>
<p>brought the world to its knees anyway.</p>
<p>It could be far worse in terms of its fatality rate or something like that, of course.</p>
<p>So the fact that that, I mean, it revealed so many flaws in our human institutions.</p>
<p>And I think I&rsquo;m rather pessimistic because I do worry about the baractol, a small group</p>
<p>who can produce catastrophe. And if you imagine someone with access to the kind of equipment that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>available in university labs or industrial labs, and they could create some dangerous pathogen,</p>
<p>then even one such person is too many. And how can we stop that? Because it&rsquo;s true that you can</p>
<p>have regulations. I mean, academies are having meetings, et cetera, about how to regulate these</p>
<p>new biological experiments, et cetera, make them safe. But even if you have all these regulations,</p>
<p>then enforcing regulations is pretty hopeless. We can&rsquo;t enforce the tax laws globally. We can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>enforce the drug laws globally. And so similarly, we can&rsquo;t readily enforce the laws against people</p>
<p>doing these dangerous experiments, even if all the governments say they should be prohibited.</p>
<p>And so my line on this is that all nations are going to face a big trade off between</p>
<p>three things we value, freedom, security, and privacy. And I think different nations will</p>
<p>make that choice differently. The Chinese would give up privacy and have certainly more security,</p>
<p>if not more liberty. But I think in our countries, I think we&rsquo;re going to have to give up more</p>
<p>privacy in the same way. That&rsquo;s a really interesting trade off. But there&rsquo;s also something</p>
<p>about human nature here, where I personally believe that all humans are capable of good and</p>
<p>evil. And there&rsquo;s some aspect to which we can fight this by encouraging people, incentivizing people</p>
<p>towards the better angels of their nature. So in order for a small group of people to create,</p>
<p>to engineer deadly pathogens, you have to have people that, for whatever trajectory took them</p>
<p>in life, wanting to do that kind of thing. And if we can aggressively work on a world</p>
<p>that sort of sees the beauty in everybody and encourages the flourishing of everybody in terms</p>
<p>of mental health, in terms of meaning, in terms of all those kinds of things, that&rsquo;s one way</p>
<p>to fight the development of weapons that can lead to atrocities.</p>
<p>RL Yes, and I completely agree with that and to reduce the reason why people feel embittered.</p>
<p>But of course, we&rsquo;ve got a long way to go to do that. Because if you look at the present world,</p>
<p>nearly everyone in Africa has reason to feel embittered because their economic development</p>
<p>is lagging behind most of the rest of the world. And the prospects of getting out of</p>
<p>the poverty trap is rather bleak, especially as the population grows. Because for instance,</p>
<p>they can&rsquo;t develop like the Eastern Tigers by cheap manufacturing, because robots have taken</p>
<p>that over. So they naturally feel embittered by the inequality. And of course, what we need to have</p>
<p>is some sort of mega version of the Marshall Plan that helped Europe in the post World War II era</p>
<p>to enable Africa to develop. That would be not just an altruistic thing for Europe to do,</p>
<p>but in our interest because otherwise, those in Africa will feel massively disaffected.</p>
<p>And indeed, it&rsquo;s a manifestation of the excessive inequalities, the fact that the</p>
<p>2000 richest people in the world have enough money to double the income of the bottom billion.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s an indictment of the ethics of the world. And this is where my friend Stephen Pinker</p>
<p>and I have had some contact. We wrote joint articles on bio threats and all that. But he</p>
<p>writes these books, being very optimistic about quoting figures about how life expectancy has gone</p>
<p>up, infant mortality has gone down, literacy has gone up, and all those things. And he&rsquo;s quite</p>
<p>right about that. And so he says the world&rsquo;s getting better. Do you disagree with your</p>
<p>friends, Stephen Pinker? Well, I mean, I agree with those facts. But I think he misses out part</p>
<p>of the picture. Because there&rsquo;s a new class of threats, which hang over us now, which didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>hang over us in the past. And I would also question whether we have collectively improved</p>
<p>our ethics at all. Because let&rsquo;s think back to the Middle Ages. It&rsquo;s true that, as Pinker says,</p>
<p>the average person was in a more miserable state than they are today, on average. For all the</p>
<p>reasons he quantifies, that&rsquo;s fine. But in the Middle Ages, there wasn&rsquo;t very much that could</p>
<p>have been done to improve people&rsquo;s lot in life because of lack of knowledge and lack of science,</p>
<p>etc. So the gap between the way the world was, which was pretty miserable, and the way the world</p>
<p>could have been, which wasn&rsquo;t all that much better, was fairly narrow. Whereas now, the gap</p>
<p>between the way the world is and the way the world could be is far, far wider. And therefore, I think</p>
<p>we are ethically more at fault in allowing this gap to get wider than it was in medieval times.</p>
<p>And so I would very much question and dispute the idea that we are ethically in advance of</p>
<p>our predecessors collectively. That&rsquo;s a lot of interesting hypotheses in there. It&rsquo;s a fascinating</p>
<p>question of how much is the size of that gap between the way the world is and the way the world</p>
<p>could be is a reflection of our ethics. Or maybe sometimes it&rsquo;s just a reflection of a very large</p>
<p>number of people. Maybe it&rsquo;s a technical challenge too. It&rsquo;s not just&hellip; Well, of our political</p>
<p>systems. And we&rsquo;re trying to figure this thing out. There&rsquo;s 20th century, tried this thing that</p>
<p>sounded really good on paper of collective, the communism type of things. And it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>turned out at least the way that was done there, that leads to atrocities and the suffering and</p>
<p>the murder of tens of millions of people. Okay, so that didn&rsquo;t work. Let&rsquo;s try democracy.</p>
<p>And that seems to have a lot of flaws, but it seems to be the best thing we got so far.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re trying to figure this out as our technologies become more and more powerful,</p>
<p>have the capacity to do a lot of good to the world, but also unfortunately have the capacity</p>
<p>to destroy the entirety of the human civilization. And I think it&rsquo;s social media generally,</p>
<p>which makes it harder to get a sort of moderate consensus because in the old days when people got</p>
<p>their news filtered through responsible journalists in this country, the BBC and the</p>
<p>main newspapers, et cetera, they would muffle the crazy extremes. Whereas now, of course,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re on the internet. And if you click on them, you get something still more extreme.</p>
<p>And so I think we are seeing a sort of dangerous polarization, which I think is going to make all</p>
<p>countries harder to govern. And that&rsquo;s something which I&rsquo;m pessimistic about.</p>
<p>RL So to push back, it is true that brilliant people like you highlighting the limitations</p>
<p>of social media is making them realize the stakes and the failings of social media companies,</p>
<p>but at the same time, they&rsquo;re revealing the division. It&rsquo;s not like they&rsquo;re creating it,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re revealing it in part. And so that puts a lot of, that puts the responsibility</p>
<p>into the hands of social media and the opportunity in the hands of social media</p>
<p>to alleviate some of that division. So it could in the long arc of human history result. So bringing</p>
<p>some of those divisions and the anger and the hatred to the surface so that we can talk about</p>
<p>it. And as opposed to disproportionately promoting it, actually just surfacing it so we can get over</p>
<p>it. Well, you&rsquo;re assuming that the fat cats are more public spirited than the politicians.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not sure about that.</p>
<p>RL I think there&rsquo;s a lot of money to be made in being publicly spirited. I think there&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>money to be made in increasing the amount of love in the world, despite the sort of public perception</p>
<p>that all the social media companies heads are interested in doing is making money.</p>
<p>I think that may be true, but I just personally believe people being happy</p>
<p>is a hell of a good business model. And so making as many people happy, helping them flourish in a</p>
<p>long term way, that&rsquo;s a good way to make money.</p>
<p>RL Well, I think on the other hand, guilt and shame are good motives to make you behave better</p>
<p>in the future. That&rsquo;s my experience.</p>
<p>RL From maybe in the political perspective, certainly it&rsquo;s the case. But it does make sense</p>
<p>now that we can destroy ourselves with nuclear weapons, with engineered pandemics and so on,</p>
<p>that the aliens would show up. If I had a leadership position, maybe as a scientist</p>
<p>or otherwise in an alien civilization, and I would come upon Earth, I would try to watch from</p>
<p>a distance, do not interfere. And I would start interfering when these life forms start</p>
<p>becoming quite, have the capacity to be destructive. And so, I mean, it is an interesting</p>
<p>question when people talk about UFO sightings and all those kinds of things that at least&hellip;</p>
<p>RL These are benign aliens you&rsquo;re thinking of.</p>
<p>RL Benign, yes. I mean, they benign, almost curious, almost, partially, as with all curiosity,</p>
<p>partially selfish to try to observe, is there something interesting about this particular</p>
<p>evolutionary system? Because I&rsquo;m sure even to aliens, Earth is a curiosity.</p>
<p>RL Yeah. Well, it&rsquo;s in its very special stage.</p>
<p>RL It&rsquo;s very special. Perhaps it&rsquo;s very short.</p>
<p>RL This century is very special among the 45 million centuries the Earth experienced already.</p>
<p>So it is a very special time where they should be specially interested. But I think going back</p>
<p>to the politics, the other problem is getting people who have short term concerns to care</p>
<p>about the long term. By the long term, I now mean just looking 30 years or so ahead. I</p>
<p>know people who&rsquo;ve been scientific advisors to governments and things, and they may make</p>
<p>these points, but of course, they don&rsquo;t have much traction because as we know very well,</p>
<p>any politician has an urgent agenda of very worrying things to deal with. And so they</p>
<p>aren&rsquo;t going to prioritize these issues, which are longer term and less immediate, and don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>just concern their constituents, they concern distant parts of the world. And so I think</p>
<p>what we have to do is to enlist charismatic individuals to convert the public, because</p>
<p>if the politicians know the public care about something, climate change as an example, then</p>
<p>they will make decisions which take cognizance of that. And I think for that to happen, then</p>
<p>we do need some public individuals who are respected by everyone, and to have a high</p>
<p>profile. And in the climate context, I would say that I&rsquo;ve mentioned four very disparate</p>
<p>people who&rsquo;ve had such a big effect in the last few years. One is Pope Francis, the other is</p>
<p>David Attenborough, the other is Bill Gates, and the other is Greta Thornberg. And those</p>
<p>four people have certainly had a big shift in public opinion, and even changed the rhetoric</p>
<p>of business, although how deep that is, I don&rsquo;t know. But politicians can&rsquo;t let these</p>
<p>issues drop down off the agenda if there&rsquo;s a public clamor, and it needs people like that</p>
<p>to keep the public clamor going.</p>
<p>To push back a little bit, so those four are very interesting, and I have deep respect</p>
<p>for them. They have, except David Attenborough, David Attenborough is really, I mean, everybody</p>
<p>loves him. I can&rsquo;t say anything. But Bill Gates and Greta, that also has created a lot</p>
<p>of division. And this is a big problem, so it&rsquo;s not just charismatic. I put that responsibility</p>
<p>actually on the scientific community and the politicians. So we need the charismatic leaders,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re rare. When you look at human history, those are the ones that make a difference.</p>
<p>Those are the ones that, not deride, they inspire the populace to think long term. The</p>
<p>JFK will go to the moon in this decade, not because it&rsquo;s easy, but because it is hard.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no discussion about short term political gains or any of that kind of stuff in the</p>
<p>vision of going to the moon, or going to Mars, or taking on gigantic projects, or taking</p>
<p>on world hunger, or taking on climate change, or the education system, all those things</p>
<p>that require long term significant investment. That requires&hellip;</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s hard to find those people. And incidentally, I think another problem, which is a downside</p>
<p>of social media, is that of younger people I know, the number who would contemplate a</p>
<p>political career has gone down because of the pressures on them and their family from</p>
<p>social media. It&rsquo;s a hell of a job now. And so I think we are all losers because the quality</p>
<p>of people who choose that path is really dropping. And as we see by the quality of those who</p>
<p>are in these compositions.</p>
<p>That said, I think the silver lining there is the quality of the competition actually</p>
<p>is inspiring because it shows to you that there&rsquo;s a dire need of leaders, which I think</p>
<p>would be inspiring to young people to step into the fold. I mean, great leaders are not</p>
<p>afraid of a little bit of fire on social media. So if you have a 20 year old kid now, 25 year</p>
<p>old kid is seeing how the world has responded to the pandemic, seeing the geopolitical division</p>
<p>over the war in Ukraine, seeing the brewing war between the West and China. We need great</p>
<p>leaders and there&rsquo;s a hunger for them and the time will come when they step up. I believe</p>
<p>that. But also to add to your list of four, he doesn&rsquo;t get enough credit. I&rsquo;ve been defending</p>
<p>him in this conversation, Elon Musk, in terms of the fight in climate change. But he also</p>
<p>has led to a lot of division, but we need more David Edinburgh.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, no. I mean, I&rsquo;m a fan. Definitely. I mean, I&rsquo;ve heard him described as a 21st</p>
<p>century Brunel for his innovation and that&rsquo;s true. But whether he&rsquo;s an ethical inspiration,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Yeah, he has a lot of fun on Twitter. Well, let me ask you to put on your wise sage hat.</p>
<p>What advice would you give to young people today? Maybe they&rsquo;re teenagers in high school,</p>
<p>maybe early college. What advice would you give to a career or have a life they can be</p>
<p>proud of?</p>
<p>Yes. Well, I&rsquo;d be very diffident, really, about offering any wisdom. But I think they</p>
<p>should realise that the choices they make at that time are important. And from the experience</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had with many friends, many people don&rsquo;t realise that opportunities open until it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>too late. They somehow think that some opportunities are only open to a few privileged people and</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t even try and that they could succeed. But if I focus on people working in some profession</p>
<p>I know about, like science, I would say pick an area to work in where new things are happening,</p>
<p>where you can do something that the old guys never had a chance to think about. Don&rsquo;t go</p>
<p>into a field that&rsquo;s fairly stagnant because then there&rsquo;s nothing much to do or you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>be trying to tackle the problems that the old guys got stuck on. And so I think in science,</p>
<p>I can give people good advice that they should pick a subject where there are exciting new</p>
<p>developments. And also, of course, something which suits their style because even within</p>
<p>science, which is just one profession, there&rsquo;s a big range of style between the sort of solitary</p>
<p>thinker, the person who does field work, the person who works in a big team, et cetera,</p>
<p>and whether you like computing or mathematical thought, et cetera. So pick some subject that</p>
<p>suits your style and where things are happening fast. And be prepared to be flexible. That&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say, really. Keep your eyes open for the opportunity throughout, like you said. Go to</p>
<p>a new field. Go to a field where new cool stuff is happening. Just keep your eyes open.</p>
<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s patitudinous. But I think most of us, and I include myself in this, didn&rsquo;t realize</p>
<p>this sort of thing isn&rsquo;t too late.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think this applies way beyond science. What do you make of this finiteness of our life?</p>
<p>Do you think about death? Do you think about mortality? Do you think about your mortality?</p>
<p>And are you afraid of death?</p>
<p>Well, I mean, I&rsquo;m not afraid because I think I&rsquo;m lucky. I feel lucky to have lasted as long as I</p>
<p>have and to have been fairly lucky in my life in many respects compared to most people. So I feel</p>
<p>very fortunate. This reminds me of this current emphasis on living much longer, the so called</p>
<p>Altos Laboratories, which have been set up by billionaires. There&rsquo;s one in San Francisco,</p>
<p>one in La Jolla, I think, and one in Cambridge. And they&rsquo;re funded by these guys who when young</p>
<p>wanted to be rich, and now they&rsquo;re rich, they want to be young again. They won&rsquo;t find that quite so</p>
<p>easy. And do we want this? I don&rsquo;t know. If there was some elite that was able to live much longer</p>
<p>than others, that would be a really fundamental kind of inequality. And I think if it happened</p>
<p>to everyone, then that might be an improvement. It&rsquo;s not so obvious. But I think for my part,</p>
<p>I think to have lived as long as most people and had a fortunate life is all I can</p>
<p>expect and a lot to be grateful for. Those are all past issues.</p>
<p>Well, I am incredibly honored that you sit down with me today. I thank you so much for life,</p>
<p>of exploring some of the deepest mysteries of our universe and of our humanity and thinking</p>
<p>about our future with existential risks that are before us. It&rsquo;s a huge honor,</p>
<p>Martin, that you sit with me and I really enjoyed it.</p>
<p>Well, thank you, Lex. I thought we couldn&rsquo;t go on for as long as this,</p>
<p>but we could have gone on much longer.</p>
<p>Exactly. Thank you so much. Thank you for listening to this conversation with Martin</p>
<p>Rees. To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now,</p>
<p>let me leave you with some words from Martin Rees himself.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to widen people&rsquo;s awareness of the tremendous time spent lying ahead for our planet</p>
<p>and for life itself. Most educated people are aware that we&rsquo;re the outcome of nearly 4 billion</p>
<p>years of Darwinian selection, but many tend to think that humans are somehow the culmination.</p>
<p>Our sun, however, is less than halfway through its lifespan. It will not be humans who watch</p>
<p>the sun&rsquo;s demise 6 billion years from now. Any creatures that then exist will be as different</p>
<p>from us as we are from bacteria or amoeba. Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.</p>
