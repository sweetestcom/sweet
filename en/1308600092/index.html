    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>where we discuss science</p>
<p>and science-based tools for everyday life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Andrew Huberman,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology</p>
<p>at Stanford School of Medicine.</p>
<p>Today, my guest is Dr. David Anderson.</p>
<p>Dr. Anderson is a professor of biology</p>
<p>at the California Institute of Technology,</p>
<p>often commonly referred to as Caltech University.</p>
<p>Dr. Anderson&rsquo;s research focuses on emotions</p>
<p>and states of mind and body.</p>
<p>And indeed, he emphasizes how emotions</p>
<p>like happiness, sadness, anger, and so on</p>
<p>are actually subcategories</p>
<p>of what are generally governed by states.</p>
<p>That is, things that are occurring in the nervous system</p>
<p>in our brain and in the connections between brain and body</p>
<p>that dictate whether or not we feel good</p>
<p>about how we are feeling,</p>
<p>and that drive our behaviors.</p>
<p>That is, bias us to be in action or inaction</p>
<p>and strongly influence the way we interpret our experience</p>
<p>and our surroundings.</p>
<p>Today, Dr. Anderson teaches us, for instance,</p>
<p>why people become aggressive</p>
<p>and why that aggression can sometimes take the form of rage.</p>
<p>Also talk about sexual behavior</p>
<p>and the boundaries and overlap</p>
<p>between aggression and sexual behavior.</p>
<p>And that discussion about aggression and sexual behavior</p>
<p>also starts to focus on particular aspects</p>
<p>of neural circuits and states of mind and body</p>
<p>that govern things like, for instance,</p>
<p>male-male aggression versus male-female aggression</p>
<p>versus female-female aggression.</p>
<p>So today you will learn a lot</p>
<p>about the biological mechanisms</p>
<p>that govern why we feel the way we feel.</p>
<p>Indeed, Dr. Anderson is an author</p>
<p>of a terrific new popular book</p>
<p>entitled, The Nature of the Beast, How Emotions Guide Us.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve read this book several times now.</p>
<p>I can tell you it contains so many gems</p>
<p>that are firmly grounded in the scientific research.</p>
<p>In fact, a lot of what&rsquo;s in the book</p>
<p>contrasts with many of the common myths</p>
<p>about emotions and biology.</p>
<p>So whether or not you&rsquo;re a therapist</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re a biologist</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re simply just somebody interested</p>
<p>in why we feel the way we feel</p>
<p>and why we act the way we act,</p>
<p>I cannot recommend the book highly enough.</p>
<p>Again, the title is The Nature of the Beast,</p>
<p>How Emotions Guide Us.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s discussion also ventures into topics</p>
<p>such as mental health and mental illness.</p>
<p>And some of the exciting discoveries</p>
<p>that have been made by Dr. Anderson&rsquo;s laboratory</p>
<p>and other laboratories,</p>
<p>identifying specific peptides, that is small proteins</p>
<p>that can govern whether or not people feel anxious</p>
<p>or less anxious, aggressive or less aggressive,</p>
<p>this is an important area of research</p>
<p>that has direct implications</p>
<p>for much of what we read about in the news,</p>
<p>both unfortunate and fortunate events,</p>
<p>and that will no doubt drive the future</p>
<p>of mental health treatments.</p>
<p>Dr. Anderson is considered one of the most pioneering</p>
<p>and important researchers in neurobiology of our time.</p>
<p>Indeed, he is a member of the National Academy of Sciences</p>
<p>and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve mentioned the HHMI once or twice before</p>
<p>when we&rsquo;ve had other HHMI guests on this podcast,</p>
<p>but for those of you that are not familiar,</p>
<p>the Howard Hughes Medical Institute</p>
<p>funds a small number of investigators</p>
<p>doing particularly high-risk, high-benefit work,</p>
<p>and it is an extremely competitive process</p>
<p>to identify those Howard Hughes investigators.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re essentially appointed,</p>
<p>and then every five years,</p>
<p>they have to compete against one another</p>
<p>and against a new incoming flock</p>
<p>of would-be HHMI investigators.</p>
<p>To get another five years of funding,</p>
<p>they are literally given a grade every five years</p>
<p>as to whether or not they can continue,</p>
<p>not continue, or whether or not they should worry</p>
<p>about being funded for an extended period of time.</p>
<p>Dr. Anderson has been an investigator</p>
<p>with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute since 1989.</p>
<p>Before we begin, I&rsquo;d like to emphasize</p>
<p>that this podcast is separate</p>
<p>from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.</p>
<p>It is, however, part of my desire and effort</p>
<p>to bring zero cost to consumer information</p>
<p>about science and science-related tools</p>
<p>to the general public.</p>
<p>In keeping with that theme,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank the sponsors of today&rsquo;s podcast.</p>
<p>Our first sponsor is Element.</p>
<p>Element is an electrolyte drink</p>
<p>with everything you need and nothing you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>That means plenty of salt, magnesium, and potassium,</p>
<p>the so-called electrolytes, and no sugar.</p>
<p>Now, salt, magnesium, and potassium are critical</p>
<p>to the function of all the cells in your body,</p>
<p>in particular, to the function of your nerve cells,</p>
<p>also called neurons.</p>
<p>In fact, in order for your neurons to function properly,</p>
<p>all three electrolytes need to be present</p>
<p>in the proper ratios.</p>
<p>And we now know that even slight reductions</p>
<p>in electrolyte concentrations or dehydration of the body</p>
<p>can lead to deficits in cognitive and physical performance.</p>
<p>Element contains a science-backed electrolyte ratio</p>
<p>of 1,000 milligrams, that&rsquo;s one gram, of sodium,</p>
<p>200 milligrams of potassium,</p>
<p>and 60 milligrams of magnesium.</p>
<p>I typically drink Element first thing in the morning</p>
<p>when I wake up in order to hydrate my body</p>
<p>and make sure I have enough electrolytes.</p>
<p>And while I do any kind of physical training</p>
<p>and after physical training as well,</p>
<p>especially if I&rsquo;ve been sweating a lot,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;d like to try Element, you can go to drinkelement,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s lmnt.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>to claim a free Element sample pack with your purchase.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s drinkelement, lmnt.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Thesis.</p>
<p>Thesis makes what are called nootropics,</p>
<p>which means smart drugs.</p>
<p>Now, to be honest, I am not a fan of the term nootropics.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe in smart drugs in the sense that</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe that there&rsquo;s any one substance</p>
<p>or collection of substances that can make us smarter.</p>
<p>I do believe based on science, however,</p>
<p>that there are particular neural circuits</p>
<p>and brain functions that allow us to be more focused,</p>
<p>more alert, access creativity, be more motivated, et cetera.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just the way that the brain works,</p>
<p>different neural circuits for different brain states.</p>
<p>Thesis understands this.</p>
<p>And as far as I know, they&rsquo;re the first nootropics company</p>
<p>to create targeted nootropics for specific outcomes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Thesis for more than six months now,</p>
<p>and I can confidently say that their nootropics</p>
<p>have been a total game changer.</p>
<p>My go-to formula is the clarity formula,</p>
<p>or sometimes I&rsquo;ll use their energy formula before training.</p>
<p>To get your own personalized nootropic starter kit,</p>
<p>go online to takethesis.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>take a three-minute quiz,</p>
<p>and Thesis will send you four different formulas</p>
<p>to try in your first month.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m pleased to announce that the Huberman Lab Podcast</p>
<p>is now partnered with Momentus Supplements.</p>
<p>We partnered with Momentus for several important reasons.</p>
<p>First of all, they ship internationally</p>
<p>because we know that many of you are located</p>
<p>outside of the United States.</p>
<p>Second of all, and perhaps most important,</p>
<p>the quality of their supplements is second to none,</p>
<p>both in terms of purity and precision</p>
<p>of the amounts of the ingredients.</p>
<p>Third, we&rsquo;ve really emphasized supplements</p>
<p>that are single ingredient supplements,</p>
<p>and that are supplied in dosages</p>
<p>that allow you to build a supplementation protocol</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for cost,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for effectiveness,</p>
<p>and that you can add things and remove things</p>
<p>from your protocol in a way</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really systematic and scientific.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to see the supplements</p>
<p>that we partner with Momentus on,</p>
<p>you can go to livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>There you&rsquo;ll see those supplements,</p>
<p>and just keep in mind that we are constantly expanding</p>
<p>the library of supplements available through Momentus</p>
<p>on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>And now for my discussion with Dr. David Anderson.</p>
<p>David, great to be here,</p>
<p>and great to finally sit down and chat with you.</p>
<p>Great to be here too.</p>
<p>Thank you so much.</p>
<p>Yeah, I have a ton of questions,</p>
<p>but I want to start with something fairly basic,</p>
<p>but that I&rsquo;m aware is a pretty vast landscape,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s the difference between emotions and states,</p>
<p>if indeed there is a difference,</p>
<p>and how we should think about emotions.</p>
<p>What are they?</p>
<p>They have all these names, happiness, sadness,</p>
<p>depression, anger, rage.</p>
<p>How should we think about them,</p>
<p>and why might states be at least as useful a thing</p>
<p>to think about, if not more useful?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>First, the short answer to your question</p>
<p>is that I see emotions as a type of internal state,</p>
<p>in the sense that arousal&rsquo;s also a type of internal state,</p>
<p>motivation&rsquo;s a type of internal state,</p>
<p>sleep is a type of internal state.</p>
<p>And the sort of simplest way I think of internal states</p>
<p>is that, as you&rsquo;ve shown in your own work,</p>
<p>they change the input to output transformation of the brain.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re asleep, you don&rsquo;t hear something</p>
<p>that you would hear if you were awake,</p>
<p>unless it&rsquo;s a really, really loud noise.</p>
<p>So from that broad perspective,</p>
<p>I see emotion as a class of state that controls behavior.</p>
<p>The reason I think it&rsquo;s useful to think about it as a state</p>
<p>is it puts the focus on it as a neurobiological process</p>
<p>rather than as a psychological process,</p>
<p>and this gets around all of the definitional problems</p>
<p>that people have with the word emotion,</p>
<p>where many people equate emotion with feeling,</p>
<p>which is a subjective sense that we can only study in humans</p>
<p>because to find out what someone&rsquo;s feeling,</p>
<p>you have to ask them, and people are the only animals</p>
<p>that can talk that we can understand.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s how I think about emotion.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the, if you think of an iceberg,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the part of the iceberg</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s below the surface of the water.</p>
<p>The feeling part is the tip that&rsquo;s sort of floating</p>
<p>above the surface of your consciousness.</p>
<p>Not that that isn&rsquo;t important, it is,</p>
<p>but you have to understand consciousness</p>
<p>if you wanna understand feelings,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re not ready to study that in animals yet.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s how I think about it.</p>
<p>What are the different components of a state?</p>
<p>You know, you mentioned arousal as a key component.</p>
<p>What are some of the other features of states</p>
<p>that represent this, as you so beautifully put in your book,</p>
<p>that represent below the tip of the iceberg?</p>
<p>Right, right.</p>
<p>So you can break states up into different facets,</p>
<p>or people would call them dimensions,</p>
<p>and so there have been people who have thought of emotions</p>
<p>as having just really two dimensions, an arousal dimension,</p>
<p>how intense is it, and also a valence dimension,</p>
<p>which is, is it positive or negative, good or bad?</p>
<p>Ralph Adolphs and I have tried to expand that a little bit</p>
<p>to think about components of emotion,</p>
<p>particularly those that distinguish emotion states</p>
<p>from motivational states,</p>
<p>because they are very closely related.</p>
<p>One of those important properties is persistence,</p>
<p>and this is something that distinguishes</p>
<p>state-driven behaviors from simple reflexes.</p>
<p>Reflexes tend to terminate when the stimulus turns off,</p>
<p>like the doctor hitting your knee with a hammer.</p>
<p>It initiates with the stimulus onset,</p>
<p>and it terminates with the stimulus offset.</p>
<p>Emotions tend to outlast, often,</p>
<p>the stimulus that evoke them.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re walking along a trail here in Southern California,</p>
<p>you hear a rattlesnake rattling,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna jump in the air,</p>
<p>but your heart is gonna continue to beat,</p>
<p>and your palms sweat,</p>
<p>and your mouth is gonna be dry for a while</p>
<p>after it&rsquo;s slithered off in the bush,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re gonna be hypervigilant.</p>
<p>If you see something that even remotely looks snake-like,</p>
<p>a stick, you&rsquo;re gonna stop and jump.</p>
<p>Persistence is an important feature of emotion states.</p>
<p>Not all states have persistence.</p>
<p>For example, you think about hunger.</p>
<p>Once you&rsquo;ve eaten, the state is gone.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not hungry anymore.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re really angry,</p>
<p>and you get into a fight with somebody,</p>
<p>even after the fight is over,</p>
<p>you may remain riled up for a long time,</p>
<p>and it takes you a while to calm down,</p>
<p>and that may have to do with the arousal dimension</p>
<p>or some other part of it.</p>
<p>And then generalization is an important component</p>
<p>of emotion states that make them,</p>
<p>if they have been triggered in one situation,</p>
<p>they can apply to another situation.</p>
<p>And my favorite example of that is,</p>
<p>you come home from work and your kid is screaming.</p>
<p>If you had a good day at work,</p>
<p>you might pick it up and soothe it.</p>
<p>And if you had a bad day at work,</p>
<p>you might react very differently to it and scream at it.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s a generalization of the state</p>
<p>that was triggered at work</p>
<p>by something your boss said to you</p>
<p>to a completely different interaction.</p>
<p>And again, that&rsquo;s something that distinguishes</p>
<p>emotion states from motivation states.</p>
<p>Motivation states are really specific.</p>
<p>Find and eat food, obtain and consume water,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re involved in homeostatic maintenance.</p>
<p>So states are very multifaceted</p>
<p>and just asking questions</p>
<p>about how these components of states are encoded,</p>
<p>like what makes a state persist?</p>
<p>What gives a state a positive or a negative valence?</p>
<p>How do you crank up or crank down the intensity of the state?</p>
<p>It just opens up a whole bunch of questions</p>
<p>that you can ask in the brain</p>
<p>with the kinds of tools we have now.</p>
<p>You mentioned arousal a few times</p>
<p>and you mentioned valence.</p>
<p>Realizing that there are these other aspects of states,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to just talk about arousal a little bit more</p>
<p>and valence, because at a very basic level,</p>
<p>it seems to me that arousal,</p>
<p>we can be very alert and pissed off,</p>
<p>stressed, worried, you have insomnia.</p>
<p>We can also be very alert and be quite happy.</p>
<p>So the valence flips.</p>
<p>People can be sexually aroused,</p>
<p>people can be aroused in all sorts of ways.</p>
<p>Is there any simple or simple-ish neurochemical signature</p>
<p>that can flip valence?</p>
<p>So for instance, is there any way that we can safely say</p>
<p>that arousal with some additional dopamine release</p>
<p>is going to be of positive valence</p>
<p>and arousal with very low dopamine</p>
<p>is going to be of negative valence?</p>
<p>I would be reluctant to say that it&rsquo;s a chemical flip.</p>
<p>I would say it&rsquo;s more likely to be a circuit flip,</p>
<p>different circuits being engaged.</p>
<p>And it might be that a given neurochemical,</p>
<p>even dopamine, is involved</p>
<p>in both positively valenced arousal</p>
<p>and negatively valenced arousal.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why people think about these as different axes.</p>
<p>So I think the interesting question that you touch on</p>
<p>is arousal something that is just completely generic</p>
<p>in the brain, or are there actually different kinds</p>
<p>of arousal that are specific to different behaviors?</p>
<p>And you raised the question,</p>
<p>sexual arousal feels different</p>
<p>from aggressive arousal, for example.</p>
<p>And we actually published a paper on this back in 2009</p>
<p>in Fruit Flies where we found some evidence</p>
<p>for two types of arousal states,</p>
<p>one of which is sleep-wake arousal.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re more aroused when you wake up</p>
<p>than when you&rsquo;re asleep, and flies show that.</p>
<p>And the other is a startle response,</p>
<p>an arousal response to a mechanical stimulus,</p>
<p>a noxious mechanical stimulus.</p>
<p>If you puff air on flies,</p>
<p>kind of like trying to swat the wasp away</p>
<p>from your burger at the picnic table,</p>
<p>they come back more and more and more vigorously.</p>
<p>And we were able to dissect this and show</p>
<p>that although both of those forms</p>
<p>of arousal require dopamine,</p>
<p>they were exerted through completely separable</p>
<p>neural circuits in the fly.</p>
<p>And so that really put, number one,</p>
<p>the emphasis on it&rsquo;s the circuit</p>
<p>that determines the type of arousal,</p>
<p>but also that arousal isn&rsquo;t unitary,</p>
<p>that there are behavior-specific forms of arousal.</p>
<p>And I think the jury is still out</p>
<p>as to whether there is such a thing</p>
<p>as completely generalized arousal or not.</p>
<p>I think some people would argue there is,</p>
<p>but I think more attention needs to be paid</p>
<p>to this question of domain-specific</p>
<p>or behavior-specific forms of arousal.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s a super interesting idea</p>
<p>because I always thought of arousal as along a continuum,</p>
<p>like you need to be in a panic attack</p>
<p>at the one end of the extreme, or you can be in a coma.</p>
<p>And then somewhere in the middle, you&rsquo;re alert and calm.</p>
<p>But then this issue of valence really,</p>
<p>as you say, presents this opportunity</p>
<p>that really there might be multiple circuits</p>
<p>for arousal or multiple mechanisms</p>
<p>that would include neurochemicals</p>
<p>as well as different neural pathways.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;d like to talk a bit about a state,</p>
<p>if it is indeed a state, which is aggression.</p>
<p>Your lab&rsquo;s worked extensively on this.</p>
<p>And if you would,</p>
<p>could you highlight some of the key findings there,</p>
<p>which brain areas that are involved,</p>
<p>the beautiful work of Dayu Lin and others in your lab,</p>
<p>that point to the idea</p>
<p>that indeed there are kind of switches in the brain,</p>
<p>but that thinking of switches for aggression</p>
<p>might be too simple.</p>
<p>How should we think about aggression?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll just sort of skew the question a bit more</p>
<p>by saying we see lots of different kinds of aggression.</p>
<p>This terrible school shooting down in Texas recently,</p>
<p>clearly an act that included aggression.</p>
<p>And yet you could imagine</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a very different type of aggression</p>
<p>than an all-out rage or a controlled aggression.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of variation there.</p>
<p>So what are your thoughts on aggression,</p>
<p>how it&rsquo;s generated, the neural circuit mechanisms,</p>
<p>and some of the variation in what we call aggression?</p>
<p>Yeah, this is a great question.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a large area.</p>
<p>I would say that the, first of all,</p>
<p>the word aggression in my mind</p>
<p>refers more to a description of behavior</p>
<p>than it does to an internal state.</p>
<p>Aggression could reflect an internal state</p>
<p>that we would call anger in humans,</p>
<p>or it could reflect fear,</p>
<p>or it could reflect hunger if it&rsquo;s predatory aggression.</p>
<p>And so this gets at the issue that you raised</p>
<p>of the different types of aggression that exist.</p>
<p>The work that Dayu did when she was in my lab</p>
<p>that really broke open the field</p>
<p>to the application of modern genetic tools</p>
<p>for studying circuits in mice</p>
<p>is that she found a way to evoke aggression in mice</p>
<p>using optogenetics to activate specific neurons</p>
<p>in a region of the hypothalamus,</p>
<p>the ventromedial hypothalamus, VMH,</p>
<p>which people had been studying and looking at for decades</p>
<p>following first the work of,</p>
<p>in cats, the famous Nobel Prize winning work of Walter Hess</p>
<p>and then followed by work done by Menno Crook</p>
<p>in the Netherlands in rats</p>
<p>where they would stick electrical wires into the brain</p>
<p>and send electric currents into the brain.</p>
<p>And they could trigger a placid cat</p>
<p>to suddenly bear its teeth, hiss,</p>
<p>and almost strike out at the experimenter.</p>
<p>And they could trigger rats to fight with each other.</p>
<p>And even in Hess&rsquo;s original experiments,</p>
<p>he describes two types of aggression</p>
<p>that he evokes from cats</p>
<p>depending on where in the hypothalamus he puts his electrode,</p>
<p>one of which he calls defensive rage.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the ears laid back, teeth bared, and hissing.</p>
<p>And the other one is predatory aggression</p>
<p>where the cat has its ears forward</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like batting with its paw at a mouse-like object</p>
<p>like it wants to catch it and eat it.</p>
<p>So he already had at that stage some information</p>
<p>about segregation in the brain</p>
<p>of different forms of aggression.</p>
<p>So fast forward to 2008, 2009,</p>
<p>when Dayu came to the lab</p>
<p>and we had started working on aggression in fruit flies,</p>
<p>and I wanted to bring it into mice</p>
<p>so that we could apply genetic tools.</p>
<p>And we started by having Dayu,</p>
<p>who was an electrophysiologist,</p>
<p>just repeat the electrical stimulation</p>
<p>of the ventromedial hypothalamus in the mouse,</p>
<p>just like people had done in rats, in cats, in hamsters,</p>
<p>even in monkeys.</p>
<p>And she could not get that experiment to work</p>
<p>over 40 different trials.</p>
<p>It just didn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>What she got instead was fear behaviors.</p>
<p>She got freezing, cornering, and crouching.</p>
<p>And finally, in desperation,</p>
<p>and we got a lot of input from Menno Crook on this,</p>
<p>he really was mystified.</p>
<p>Why doesn&rsquo;t it work in mice?</p>
<p>We realized why there had been no paper</p>
<p>on brain-stimulated aggression in mice in 50 years</p>
<p>because the experiment doesn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>And the one bit of credit I can claim there</p>
<p>is I convinced Dayu to try optogenetics</p>
<p>because it just had sort of come into use</p>
<p>deep in the brain from Carl Deisseroth and others&rsquo; work.</p>
<p>And I thought maybe because it could be directed</p>
<p>more specifically to a region of the brain</p>
<p>and types of cells than electrical stimulation,</p>
<p>it might work.</p>
<p>And Dayu said, never, never gonna work.</p>
<p>If it doesn&rsquo;t work with electricity,</p>
<p>why should it work with optogenetics?</p>
<p>And the fact is that it did work,</p>
<p>and we were able to trigger aggression in this region</p>
<p>using optogenetic stimulation of ventromedial hypothalamus.</p>
<p>And in retrospect, I think the reason</p>
<p>that we were seeing all these fear behaviors</p>
<p>is because right at the upper part,</p>
<p>if you think of ventromedial hypothalamus</p>
<p>like a pear sitting on the ground,</p>
<p>the fat part of the pear near the ground</p>
<p>is where the aggression neurons are,</p>
<p>but the upper part of the pear has fear neurons.</p>
<p>And it could be because it&rsquo;s so small in a mouse,</p>
<p>when you inject electrical current anywhere in the pear,</p>
<p>it flows up through the entire pear</p>
<p>and it activates the fear circuits</p>
<p>and those totally dominate aggression.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s why we were never able to see</p>
<p>any fighting with electrical stimulation.</p>
<p>Whereas when you use optogenetics,</p>
<p>you confine the stimulation just to the region</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;ve implanted the channelrhodopsin gene</p>
<p>into those neurons.</p>
<p>And so in fast forward from that,</p>
<p>from a lot of work from Dayu now on her own at NYU</p>
<p>and with her postdoc, Anna Gret Falkner,</p>
<p>there is, as well as work of other people,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s evidence that the type of fighting</p>
<p>that we elicit when we stimulate VMH</p>
<p>is offensive aggression</p>
<p>that is actually rewarding to male mice.</p>
<p>They like it.</p>
<p>They like it.</p>
<p>Male mice will learn to poke their nose</p>
<p>or press a bar to get the opportunity</p>
<p>to beat up a subordinate male mouse.</p>
<p>And in more recent experiments,</p>
<p>if you activate those neurons</p>
<p>and the mouse has a chance to be</p>
<p>in one of two compartments in a box,</p>
<p>they will gravitate towards the compartment</p>
<p>where those neurons are activated.</p>
<p>It has a positive valence.</p>
<p>And when I went into this field and I was thinking,</p>
<p>well, what goes on in my brain and my body</p>
<p>when I&rsquo;m furious?</p>
<p>It certainly doesn&rsquo;t feel like a rewarding experience.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not something that I would want to repeat</p>
<p>because it feels good when I&rsquo;m in that state.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t feel good at all when I&rsquo;m in that state.</p>
<p>And it is still, I think, a mystery</p>
<p>as to where that type of aggression,</p>
<p>which is more defensive aggression,</p>
<p>the kind of aggression you feel if you&rsquo;re being attacked</p>
<p>or if you&rsquo;ve been cheated by somebody,</p>
<p>where that is encoded in the brain and how that works</p>
<p>still, I think, is a very important mystery</p>
<p>that we haven&rsquo;t solved.</p>
<p>And predatory aggression, there has been some progress on.</p>
<p>So mice show predatory aggression.</p>
<p>They use that to catch crickets that they eat,</p>
<p>and that involves different circuits</p>
<p>than the ventromedial hypothalamic circuits.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s become clear that if you want to call it</p>
<p>the state of aggressiveness is multifaceted.</p>
<p>It depends on the type of aggression,</p>
<p>and it involves different sorts of circuits.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a paper suggesting that there might be</p>
<p>a final common pathway for all aggression</p>
<p>in a region, which is one of my favorites.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called the substantia innominata,</p>
<p>the substance with no name.</p>
<p>You know, I like these-</p>
<p>Anatomists are so creative.</p>
<p>Or the nucleus ambiguous, you know, or the zona inserta.</p>
<p>These are places that no one can think of what they are.</p>
<p>Anyhow, that might be a final common pathway</p>
<p>for predatory aggression and offensive</p>
<p>and defensive aggression, but it can be really hard to tell</p>
<p>just from looking at a mouse fight,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s engaged in offensive or defensive aggression.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve tried to take that apart</p>
<p>using machine learning analysis of behavior.</p>
<p>But in rats, for example, it&rsquo;s much clearer</p>
<p>when the animal is engaged in offensive</p>
<p>versus defensive aggression.</p>
<p>They direct their bites at different parts</p>
<p>of the opponent&rsquo;s body.</p>
<p>In particular.</p>
<p>Offensive aggression is flank directed.</p>
<p>Defensive aggression goes for the neck, goes for the throat.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen some nature specials where,</p>
<p>in a very barbaric way, at least to me,</p>
<p>it seems like hyenas will try and go after</p>
<p>the reproductive axis.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll go after testicles and penis,</p>
<p>and they basically wanna,</p>
<p>it seems they wanna limit future breeding potential.</p>
<p>Or create pain.</p>
<p>Right, or create pain, or both.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, in terms of offensive aggression</p>
<p>and your reflection that it doesn&rsquo;t feel good,</p>
<p>I mean, I can say I know some people</p>
<p>who really enjoy fighting.</p>
<p>I have a relative who&rsquo;s a lawyer.</p>
<p>He loves to argue and fight.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think of him as physically aggressive.</p>
<p>In fact, he&rsquo;s not, but loves to fight</p>
<p>and loves to prosecute and go after people.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s pretty effective at it.</p>
<p>I have a friend, former military special operations,</p>
<p>and very calm guy.</p>
<p>Had a great career in military special operations.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;ll quite plainly say, I love to fight.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of my great joys.</p>
<p>He really enjoyed his work.</p>
<p>And also respected the other side</p>
<p>because they offered the opportunity to test that</p>
<p>and to experience that joy.</p>
<p>So in a kind of bizarre way to somebody like me</p>
<p>who I&rsquo;ll certainly defend my stance if I need to,</p>
<p>but I certainly don&rsquo;t consider myself somebody</p>
<p>who offensively goes after people just to go after them.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no quote unquote dopamine hit here.</p>
<p>Acknowledging that dopamine does many things, of course.</p>
<p>I have a couple of questions</p>
<p>about the way you described the circuitry.</p>
<p>I should say the way the circuitry is arranged.</p>
<p>And of course we don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>because we weren&rsquo;t consulted at the design phase.</p>
<p>But why do you think there would be</p>
<p>such a close positioning of neurons</p>
<p>that can elicit such divergent states and behaviors?</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;re talking about this pear-shaped structure</p>
<p>where the neurons that generate fear are cheek to jowl</p>
<p>with the neurons that generate offensive aggression</p>
<p>of all things.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like putting the neurons that control swallowing</p>
<p>next to the neurons that control vomiting.</p>
<p>It just seems to me that on the one hand,</p>
<p>this is the way that neural circuits are often arranged.</p>
<p>And yet to me, it&rsquo;s always been perplexing</p>
<p>as to why this would be the case.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think that is a very profound question.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve wondered about that a lot.</p>
<p>If you think from an evolutionary perspective,</p>
<p>it might have been the case that defensive behaviors</p>
<p>and fear arose before offensive aggression.</p>
<p>Because animals first and foremost</p>
<p>have to defend themselves from predation by other animals.</p>
<p>And maybe it&rsquo;s only when they&rsquo;re comfortable</p>
<p>with having warded off predation and made themselves safe</p>
<p>that they can start to think about</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s gonna be the alpha male in my group here.</p>
<p>And so it could be that if you think that brain regions</p>
<p>and cell populations evolved by duplication</p>
<p>and modification of pre-existing cell populations,</p>
<p>that might be the way that those regions wound up</p>
<p>next to each other.</p>
<p>And developmentally, they start out</p>
<p>from a common pool of precursors</p>
<p>that expresses the same gene,</p>
<p>the fear neurons and the aggression neurons.</p>
<p>And then with development,</p>
<p>it gets shut off in the aggression neurons</p>
<p>and maintained in the fear neurons.</p>
<p>Now that view says, oh, it&rsquo;s just an,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an accident of evolution and development,</p>
<p>but I think there must be a functional part as well.</p>
<p>So one thing we know about offensive aggression</p>
<p>is that strong fear shuts it down.</p>
<p>Whereas defensive aggression, at least in rats,</p>
<p>is actually enhanced by fear.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of the big differences</p>
<p>between defensive aggression and offensive aggression.</p>
<p>And you think about it, if you think about it,</p>
<p>if offensive aggression is rewarding and pleasurable,</p>
<p>if you start to get really scared,</p>
<p>that tends to take the fun out of it.</p>
<p>And maybe these two regions are close to each other</p>
<p>to facilitate inhibition of aggression by the fear neurons.</p>
<p>We know for a fact that if we deliberately stimulate</p>
<p>those fear neurons at the top of the pair,</p>
<p>when two animals are involved in a fight,</p>
<p>it just stops the fight, detonates tracks,</p>
<p>and they go off into the corner and freeze.</p>
<p>So at least hierarchically, it seems like fear</p>
<p>is the dominant behavior over offensive aggression.</p>
<p>And how that inhibition would work is not clear</p>
<p>because all these neurons are pretty much excitatory.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re almost all glutamatergic.</p>
<p>And so one of the interesting questions for the future</p>
<p>is how exactly does fear dominate over</p>
<p>and shut down offensive aggression in the brain?</p>
<p>How does that work?</p>
<p>Is it all circuitry?</p>
<p>Are there chemicals involved?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the mechanism and when is it called into play?</p>
<p>But I think that&rsquo;s the way I tend to think about</p>
<p>why these neurons are all mixed up together.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not just fight and freezing or fight and flight.</p>
<p>There are also metabolic neurons</p>
<p>that are mixed together in VMH as well.</p>
<p>Controlling body-wide metabolism?</p>
<p>Yeah, there are neurons there that respond to glucose.</p>
<p>When glucose goes up in your bloodstream,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re activated.</p>
<p>And VMH has a whole history in the field of obesity</p>
<p>because if you destroy it in a rat, you get a fat rat.</p>
<p>So the way most of the world thinks about VMH</p>
<p>is they think about, oh, that&rsquo;s the thing</p>
<p>that keeps you from getting fat.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the anti-obesity area.</p>
<p>But in the area of social behavior,</p>
<p>we see it as a center for control</p>
<p>of aggression and fear behaviors.</p>
<p>And again, why these neurons and these functions,</p>
<p>I like to call them the four Fs,</p>
<p>feeding, freezing, fighting, and mating,</p>
<p>that they all seem to be closely intermingled</p>
<p>with each other, maybe because crosstalk between them</p>
<p>is very important to help the animal&rsquo;s brain</p>
<p>decide what behavior to prioritize</p>
<p>and what behavior to shut down at any given moment.</p>
<p>One of the things that we will do</p>
<p>is link to the incredible videos of these mice</p>
<p>that have selective stimulation of neurons in the VMH,</p>
<p>DIU&rsquo;s and the other studies that you&rsquo;ve done.</p>
<p>Whenever I teach, I show those videos at some point</p>
<p>with the caveats and warnings that are required</p>
<p>when one is about to see a video of a mouse</p>
<p>trying to mate with another mouse</p>
<p>or mating with another mouse.</p>
<p>And they seem both to be quite happy</p>
<p>about the mating experience,</p>
<p>at least as far as we know,</p>
<p>as observers of mice.</p>
<p>And then upon stimulation of those VMH neurons,</p>
<p>one of the mice essentially tries to kill the other mouse.</p>
<p>And then when that stimulation is stopped,</p>
<p>they basically go back to hanging out.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t go right back to mating.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some reconciliation clearly</p>
<p>that needs to happen first, we assume.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s just so striking.</p>
<p>I think equally striking is the video</p>
<p>where the mouse is alone in there with the glove,</p>
<p>the VMH neurons are stimulated,</p>
<p>and the mouse goes into a rage.</p>
<p>It looks like it wants to kill the glove, basically.</p>
<p>So striking.</p>
<p>I encourage people to go watch those</p>
<p>because it really puts a tremendous amount of color</p>
<p>on what we&rsquo;re describing.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just the idea that there are switches in the brain</p>
<p>to me really became clear upon seeing that.</p>
<p>One of the concepts, excuse me,</p>
<p>one of the concepts that you&rsquo;ve raised</p>
<p>in your lectures before,</p>
<p>and that I think was Hess&rsquo;s idea,</p>
<p>is this idea of a sort of hydraulic pressure,</p>
<p>or maybe it was Conrad, I can&rsquo;t speak now, excuse me,</p>
<p>Conrad Lorenz, pardon,</p>
<p>who talked about a kind of hydraulic pressure</p>
<p>towards behavior.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m fascinated by this idea of hydraulic pressure</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t consider myself a hot-tempered person,</p>
<p>but I am familiar with the fact that when I lose my temper,</p>
<p>it takes quite a while for me to simmer down.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t think about anything else.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna think about anything else.</p>
<p>In fact, trying to think about anything else</p>
<p>becomes aversive to me,</p>
<p>which to me underscores this notion of prioritization</p>
<p>of the different states and potentially conflicting states.</p>
<p>What do you think funnels into this idea</p>
<p>of hydraulic pressure toward a state?</p>
<p>And why is it perhaps that sometimes we can be very angry</p>
<p>and if we succeed in winning an argument,</p>
<p>all of a sudden it will subside?</p>
<p>Because clearly that means that there are</p>
<p>external influences.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a complex space here that we&rsquo;re creating.</p>
<p>I realize I&rsquo;m creating a bit of a cloud</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m doing it on purpose because to me,</p>
<p>the idea of a hydraulic pressure towards a state,</p>
<p>like sleep, there&rsquo;s a sleep pressure.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a pressure towards, that all makes sense.</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s involved?</p>
<p>Is it too multifactorial to actually separate out</p>
<p>the variables?</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s really driving hydraulic pressure</p>
<p>toward a given state?</p>
<p>Yeah, so really important question.</p>
<p>I think one way that is helpful, at least for me,</p>
<p>to break this question apart and think about it</p>
<p>is to distinguish homeostatic behaviors</p>
<p>that is need-based behaviors where the pressure</p>
<p>is built up because of a need, like I&rsquo;m hungry,</p>
<p>I need to eat, I&rsquo;m thirsty, I need to drink, I&rsquo;m hot,</p>
<p>I need to get to a cold place.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s basically the thermostat model of your brain.</p>
<p>You have a set point and then if the temperature</p>
<p>gets too hot, you turn on the AC,</p>
<p>and if the temperature gets too cold,</p>
<p>you turn on the heater and you put yourself</p>
<p>back to the set point.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s how aggression works.</p>
<p>That is, it&rsquo;s not that we all go around,</p>
<p>at least subjectively, I don&rsquo;t go around</p>
<p>with an accumulating need to fight,</p>
<p>which I then look for something to,</p>
<p>an excuse to release it.</p>
<p>Now, maybe there are people that do that</p>
<p>and they go out and look for bar fights to get into.</p>
<p>Or Twitter.</p>
<p>Yeah, or Twitter.</p>
<p>Twitter seems to, I&rsquo;m sort of half joking</p>
<p>because Twitter seems to draw a reasonably sized crowd</p>
<p>of people that are there for combat of some sort,</p>
<p>even though the total intellectual power</p>
<p>of any of their comments is about that of a cap gun,</p>
<p>they seem to really like to fire off that cap gun.</p>
<p>But I agree.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to take a quick break</p>
<p>and acknowledge one of our sponsors, Athletic Greens.</p>
<p>Athletic Greens, now called AG1,</p>
<p>is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink</p>
<p>that covers all of your foundational nutritional needs.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been taking Athletic Greens since 2012,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m delighted that they&rsquo;re sponsoring the podcast.</p>
<p>The reason I started taking Athletic Greens</p>
<p>and the reason I still take Athletic Greens</p>
<p>once or usually twice a day is that it gets me</p>
<p>the probiotics that I need for gut health.</p>
<p>Our gut is very important.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s populated by gut microbiota</p>
<p>that communicate with the brain, the immune system,</p>
<p>and basically all the biological systems of our body</p>
<p>to strongly impact our immediate and long-term health.</p>
<p>And those probiotics in Athletic Greens are optimal</p>
<p>and vital for microbiotic health.</p>
<p>In addition, Athletic Greens contains a number</p>
<p>of adaptogens, vitamins, and minerals that make sure</p>
<p>that all of my foundational nutritional needs are met</p>
<p>and it tastes great.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Athletic Greens,</p>
<p>you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll give you five free travel packs</p>
<p>that make it really easy to mix up Athletic Greens</p>
<p>while you&rsquo;re on the road, in the car, on the plane, et cetera</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll give you a year supply of vitamin D3K2.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>to get the five free travel packs</p>
<p>and the year supply of vitamin D3K2.</p>
<p>Yeah, so you can think of this accumulated hydraulic pressure</p>
<p>either being based on something that you were deprived of</p>
<p>creating an accumulating need</p>
<p>or something that you want to do,</p>
<p>building up a driver or pressure to do that.</p>
<p>And the natural way to think about that, at least for me,</p>
<p>is as a gradual increases in neural activity</p>
<p>in a particular region of the brain.</p>
<p>And so for example, in the area of the hypothalamus</p>
<p>that controls feeding, Scott Sternson and others</p>
<p>have shown that the hungrier you get,</p>
<p>the higher the level of activity</p>
<p>in that region in the brain.</p>
<p>And then when you eat, boom,</p>
<p>the activity goes right back down again.</p>
<p>And that state is actually negatively valence.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like the animal, quote unquote,</p>
<p>feels increasingly uncomfortable,</p>
<p>just like we feel increasingly uncomfortable</p>
<p>the hungrier we are.</p>
<p>And then when we eat, it taps it down.</p>
<p>But there is this increased activity.</p>
<p>And I think in the case of aggression,</p>
<p>our data and others show that the more strongly</p>
<p>you drive this region of the brain optogenetically,</p>
<p>the more of just a hair trigger you need</p>
<p>to set the animal off to get it to fight.</p>
<p>And the interesting thing is that</p>
<p>if there is nothing for the animal to attack,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t really do much</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re stimulating this region.</p>
<p>It sort of wanders around the cage a little bit more,</p>
<p>but it will not actually show overt attack</p>
<p>unless you put something in front of it.</p>
<p>And the same thing is true for the areas</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve described that control mating behavior.</p>
<p>This is what Lindsey is working on.</p>
<p>You can stimulate those areas till you&rsquo;re blue in the face</p>
<p>and the mouse just sort of wanders around.</p>
<p>But if you put another mouse in, wham,</p>
<p>he will try to mount that mouse.</p>
<p>If you put a kumquat in the cage,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;ll try to mount the kumquat.</p>
<p>And so it becomes a sort of any port in the storm.</p>
<p>So there is this idea that the drive is building up pressure</p>
<p>that somehow needs to be released</p>
<p>where that pressure is actually being exerted.</p>
<p>If you accept that it&rsquo;s increased activity</p>
<p>in some circuit or circuits someplace,</p>
<p>what is it pushing up against that needs something else</p>
<p>to sort of unplug it in the Lorentz hydraulic model?</p>
<p>That is, you don&rsquo;t see the behavior</p>
<p>until you release a valve on this bucket</p>
<p>and let the accumulated pressure flow out.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s one of the things we&rsquo;re trying to study</p>
<p>in the context of the mating behavior as well.</p>
<p>How does the information that there&rsquo;s an object</p>
<p>in front of you come together with this drive state</p>
<p>that is generated by stimulating these neurons</p>
<p>in the hypothalamus to say, okay, pull the trigger and go.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s time to mate, it&rsquo;s time to attack.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re just starting to get some insights into that now.</p>
<p>Fascinating.</p>
<p>And I should mention people, Dr. Anderson mentioned Lindsey.</p>
<p>Lindsey is a former graduate student of mine</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s now a postdoc in David&rsquo;s lab.</p>
<p>And I haven&rsquo;t caught up with her recently</p>
<p>to hear about these experiments, but they sound fascinating.</p>
<p>I would love to spend some time on this issue</p>
<p>of why is it that a mouse won&rsquo;t attack nothing,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;ll attack even a glove.</p>
<p>And why, well, it will only try and mate</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s another mouse to mate with.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually, I think fortunately for you,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not spending a lot of time</p>
<p>on Twitter and Instagram or YouTube,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s this whole online community that exists now.</p>
<p>As far as I know, it&rsquo;s almost exclusively young males</p>
<p>who are obsessed with this idea.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just say it has a name,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s called NoFap of No Masturbation</p>
<p>as a way to maintain their motivation</p>
<p>to go out and actually seek mates</p>
<p>because of the ready availability of online pornography.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s probably a much larger population of young males</p>
<p>that are never actually going out and seeking mates</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re getting porn addicted, et cetera.</p>
<p>This is actually a serious issue that came up in our episode</p>
<p>with Anna Lemke, who wrote the book,</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Dopamine Nation&rsquo;,&rdquo;</p>
<p>because the availability of pornography,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a whole social context</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s being created around this and genuine addiction.</p>
<p>So humans are not like the mice</p>
<p>or mice are not like the humans.</p>
<p>Humans seem to resolve the issue on their own</p>
<p>in ways that might actually impede</p>
<p>seeking and finding of sexual partners</p>
<p>and or long-term mates.</p>
<p>So serious issue there.</p>
<p>I raise it as a serious issue that I hear a lot about</p>
<p>because I get asked hundreds,</p>
<p>if not thousands of questions about this.</p>
<p>Is there any physiological basis for what they call NoFap?</p>
<p>And I never actually reply because there&rsquo;s no data,</p>
<p>but what you&rsquo;re raising here</p>
<p>is a very interesting mechanistic scenario</p>
<p>that can, as you mentioned, is being explored.</p>
<p>So what do we know about the internal state of a mouse</p>
<p>whose VMH is being stimulated</p>
<p>or a mouse whose other brain region</p>
<p>that can stimulate the desire to mate?</p>
<p>What do we know about the internal state of that a mouse</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s just alone in the cage wandering around?</p>
<p>Is it wandering around really wanting to mate</p>
<p>and really wanting to fight?</p>
<p>We of course don&rsquo;t know, but is its heart rate up?</p>
<p>Is its blood pressure up?</p>
<p>Is it wishing that there was pornography?</p>
<p>Is it something&rsquo;s going on presumably</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s different than prior to that stimulation</p>
<p>and is it arousal?</p>
<p>And what do you think it is about the visual</p>
<p>or olfactory perception of a conspecific</p>
<p>that ungates this tremendous repertoire of behaviors?</p>
<p>Right, that is the central question.</p>
<p>I can say, at least with respect to the fear neurons</p>
<p>that sit on top of the aggression neurons,</p>
<p>we know that when those neurons are activated optogenetically</p>
<p>in the same way we would activate the aggression neurons,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s clearly an arousal process that&rsquo;s occurring.</p>
<p>You can see the pupils dilate in the animal.</p>
<p>There is an increase in stress hormone release</p>
<p>into the bloodstream.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve shown that heart rate goes up.</p>
<p>So in addition to the drive to actually freeze,</p>
<p>which is what those animals do,</p>
<p>there is autonomic arousal and neuroendocrine activation</p>
<p>of stress responses.</p>
<p>And some of that is probably shared by the aggression neurons</p>
<p>and the mating neurons,</p>
<p>although we haven&rsquo;t investigated it in as much detail.</p>
<p>But I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised because they project</p>
<p>to many of the same regions that the fear neurons project to,</p>
<p>which is a interesting issue in the context</p>
<p>to discuss later maybe in the context</p>
<p>of why we&rsquo;re comfortable with mental illnesses</p>
<p>that are based on maladaptations of fear,</p>
<p>but not mental illnesses that are based</p>
<p>on maladaptations of aggression</p>
<p>if they have pretty similar circuits in the brain.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s how I would imagine</p>
<p>there is an arousal dimension, as you say.</p>
<p>There are stress hormones that are activated.</p>
<p>These regions, VMH projects</p>
<p>to about 30 different regions in the brain,</p>
<p>and it gets input from about 30 different regions.</p>
<p>So I kind of see it as both an antenna</p>
<p>and a broadcasting center.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a satellite dish that takes in information</p>
<p>from different sensory modalities,</p>
<p>smell, maybe vision, mechanical, mechanosensation,</p>
<p>and then it sort of synthesizes and integrates that</p>
<p>into a fairly low dimensional,</p>
<p>as the computational people call it,</p>
<p>representation of this pressure to attack.</p>
<p>And it broadcasts that all over the brain</p>
<p>to trigger all these systems</p>
<p>that have to be brought into play</p>
<p>if the animal is gonna engage in aggression.</p>
<p>Because aggression is a very risky thing</p>
<p>for an animal to engage in.</p>
<p>It could wind up losing,</p>
<p>and it could wind up getting killed.</p>
<p>And so its brain constantly has</p>
<p>to make a cost-benefit analysis</p>
<p>of whether to continue on that path</p>
<p>or to back off as well.</p>
<p>And I think that part of this broadcasting function</p>
<p>of this region is engaging all these other brain domains</p>
<p>that play a role in this kind of cost-benefit analysis.</p>
<p>I wanna talk more about mating behavior,</p>
<p>but as a segue to that,</p>
<p>as we&rsquo;re talking about aggression and mating behavior,</p>
<p>I think hormones.</p>
<p>And whenever there&rsquo;s an opportunity on this podcast</p>
<p>to shatter a common myth, I grab it.</p>
<p>One of the common myths that&rsquo;s out there,</p>
<p>and I think that persists,</p>
<p>is that testosterone makes animals and humans aggressive</p>
<p>and estrogen makes animals placid and kind or emotional.</p>
<p>And as we both know,</p>
<p>nothing could be further from the truth,</p>
<p>although there&rsquo;s some truth to the idea</p>
<p>that these hormones are all involved.</p>
<p>Robert Sapolsky supplied some information to me</p>
<p>when he came on this podcast</p>
<p>that if you give people exogenous testosterone,</p>
<p>it tends to make them more of the way they were before.</p>
<p>If they were a jerk before, they&rsquo;ll become more of a jerk.</p>
<p>If they were very altruistic, they&rsquo;ll become more altruistic.</p>
<p>And then eventually I pointed out,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll aromatize that testosterone and estrogen</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll start getting opposite effects.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a murky space.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not straightforward.</p>
<p>But if I&rsquo;m not mistaken,</p>
<p>testosterone plays a role in generating aggression.</p>
<p>However, the specific hormones that are involved</p>
<p>in generating aggression via VMH</p>
<p>are things other than testosterone.</p>
<p>Can you tell us a little bit more about that?</p>
<p>Because there&rsquo;s some interesting surprises in there.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s a really important question.</p>
<p>So when we finally identified the neurons in VMH</p>
<p>that control aggression with a molecular marker,</p>
<p>we found out that that marker was the estrogen receptor.</p>
<p>So that might strike you as a little strange.</p>
<p>Why should aggression-promoting neurons in male mice</p>
<p>be labeled with the estrogen receptor?</p>
<p>Other labs have shown that the estrogen receptor</p>
<p>in adult male mice is necessary for aggression.</p>
<p>If you knock out the gene in VMH, they don&rsquo;t fight.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s been shown,</p>
<p>and a lot of this is work from your colleague,</p>
<p>Nirav Shah at Stanford,</p>
<p>who was one of my former PhD students,</p>
<p>that if you castrate a mouse</p>
<p>and it loses the ability to fight,</p>
<p>not only can you rescue fighting with a testosterone implant,</p>
<p>but you can rescue it with an estrogen implant.</p>
<p>So you can bypass completely the requirement</p>
<p>for testosterone to restore aggressiveness to the mice.</p>
<p>And as you say,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s because many of the effects of testosterone,</p>
<p>although not all,</p>
<p>many of them are mediated by its conversion to estrogen</p>
<p>by a process called aromatization.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s carried out by an enzyme called aromatase.</p>
<p>In fact, people may have,</p>
<p>most of your listeners may have heard of aromatase</p>
<p>because aromatase inhibitors</p>
<p>are widely used in female humans</p>
<p>as adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer.</p>
<p>They are a way of reducing the production of estrogen</p>
<p>by preventing testosterone</p>
<p>from being converted into estrogen.</p>
<p>And in fact, there are a lot of animal experiments</p>
<p>showing if you give males aromatase inhibitors,</p>
<p>they stop fighting</p>
<p>as well as also stop being sexually active.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s one of the counterintuitive ideas.</p>
<p>And Nirao has shown that progesterone</p>
<p>also seems to play a role in aggression</p>
<p>because these aggression neurons</p>
<p>also express the progesterone receptor.</p>
<p>So here are two hormones that are classically thought of</p>
<p>as female reproductive hormones.</p>
<p>This is what goes up and goes down during the estrous cycle,</p>
<p>estrogen and progesterone.</p>
<p>And yet they&rsquo;re playing a very important role</p>
<p>in controlling aggression in male mice</p>
<p>and presumably in male humans as well.</p>
<p>Fascinating.</p>
<p>So estrogen is doing many more things</p>
<p>than I think most people believe in.</p>
<p>Testosterone is doing maybe different</p>
<p>and fewer things in some cases and more in others.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve known some aggressive females</p>
<p>over the time I&rsquo;ve been alive.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s involved in female aggression</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s unique from the pathways</p>
<p>that generate male aggression?</p>
<p>Great, great question.</p>
<p>So we and other labs have studied this</p>
<p>in both mice and also in fruit flies.</p>
<p>So one thing in mice</p>
<p>that distinguishes aggression in females from males</p>
<p>is that male mice are pretty much ready to fight</p>
<p>at the drop of a hat.</p>
<p>Female mice only fight</p>
<p>when they are nurturing and nursing their pups</p>
<p>after they&rsquo;ve delivered a litter.</p>
<p>And there is a window there</p>
<p>where they become hyper aggressive.</p>
<p>And then after their pups are weaned,</p>
<p>that aggressiveness goes away.</p>
<p>So this is pretty remarkable</p>
<p>that you take a virgin female mouse</p>
<p>and expose it to a male</p>
<p>and her response is to become sexually receptive</p>
<p>and to mate with him.</p>
<p>And now you let her have her pups</p>
<p>and you put the same male</p>
<p>or another male mouse in the cage with her.</p>
<p>And instead of trying to mate with him,</p>
<p>she attacks him.</p>
<p>So there is some presumably hormonal</p>
<p>and also neuronal switch that&rsquo;s occurring in the brain</p>
<p>that switches the response of the female</p>
<p>from sex to aggression</p>
<p>when she goes from virginity to maternity.</p>
<p>And we recently showed in a paper,</p>
<p>this is work from one of my students,</p>
<p>Mengyu Liu,</p>
<p>that within VMH in females,</p>
<p>there are two clearly divisible subsets</p>
<p>of estrogen receptor neurons.</p>
<p>And she showed that one of those subsets controls fighting</p>
<p>and the other one controls mating.</p>
<p>And in fact,</p>
<p>if you stimulate the fighting specific subset in a virgin,</p>
<p>you can get the virgin to attack,</p>
<p>which is something that we were never able to do before.</p>
<p>And if you stimulate the mating one,</p>
<p>you enhance mating.</p>
<p>The reason we could never get these results</p>
<p>when we stimulated the whole population</p>
<p>of estrogen receptor neurons</p>
<p>is that these effects are opposite and they cancel out.</p>
<p>And so it turns out that if you measure the activity</p>
<p>of the fighting and the mating neurons</p>
<p>going from a virgin to a maternal female,</p>
<p>the aggression neurons are very low</p>
<p>in their activity in the virgin.</p>
<p>But once the female has pups,</p>
<p>the activation ability of those neurons goes way up</p>
<p>and the mating neurons stay the same.</p>
<p>So if you think of the balance between them like a seesaw,</p>
<p>in the virgin,</p>
<p>there is more activity in the mating neurons</p>
<p>than in the fighting neurons.</p>
<p>Whereas in the nursing mother,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s more activity or more activation</p>
<p>in the other way around,</p>
<p>the fighting neurons and the mating.</p>
<p>Did I say fighting and mating the first?</p>
<p>Mating neurons dominate fighting.</p>
<p>In the virgin, fighting neurons dominate mating</p>
<p>in the mother.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a really cool observation</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not something that happens in males.</p>
<p>And we don&rsquo;t know what causes that or controls that.</p>
<p>Interestingly, this gets into the whole issue</p>
<p>of neurons that are present in females, but not in males.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve known for, the field has known for a long time</p>
<p>that male and female fruit flies have sex specific neurons.</p>
<p>And most of the neurons that we&rsquo;ve identified</p>
<p>in fruit flies that control fighting in males</p>
<p>are male specific.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not found in the female brain,</p>
<p>but recently we discovered a set of female specific</p>
<p>fighting neurons in the female brain,</p>
<p>together with a couple of other laboratories.</p>
<p>Now they do share one common population of neurons</p>
<p>in both male and female flies that in females activates</p>
<p>the female specific fighting neurons</p>
<p>and in males activates the male specific fighting neurons.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s kind of a hierarchy with this common neuron on top.</p>
<p>And in mice, we discovered that there are</p>
<p>male specific neurons in VMH</p>
<p>and those neurons are activated during male aggression.</p>
<p>Now the neurons that are active in females,</p>
<p>when females fight in VMH are not sex specific.</p>
<p>So they are also found in males.</p>
<p>So this is already showing you some complexity.</p>
<p>The male mouse VMH has both male specific aggression neurons</p>
<p>and generic aggression neurons.</p>
<p>And then the female VMH, the mating cells</p>
<p>are only found in females.</p>
<p>They are female specific and not found in the male brain.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;re trying to find out</p>
<p>what these sex specific populations of neurons are doing,</p>
<p>but that indicates that that is some of the mechanism</p>
<p>by which different sexes show different behaviors.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m fixated on this transition from the virgin female mouse</p>
<p>to the maternal female mouse.</p>
<p>I have a couple of questions about whether or not,</p>
<p>for instance, the transition is governed</p>
<p>by the presence of pups.</p>
<p>So for instance, if you take a virgin female,</p>
<p>she&rsquo;ll mate with a male.</p>
<p>Once she&rsquo;s had pups, she&rsquo;ll try and fight that male</p>
<p>or presumably another intruder female, right?</p>
<p>Equally towards females and male intruders.</p>
<p>Does that require the presence of her pups?</p>
<p>Meaning if you were to take those pups</p>
<p>and give them to another mother,</p>
<p>it does she revert to the more virgin like behavior?</p>
<p>Is it related to, is it triggered by lactation</p>
<p>or could it actually be triggered</p>
<p>by the mating behavior itself?</p>
<p>Cause it&rsquo;s possible for the virgin to become a non-virgin,</p>
<p>but not actually have a litter of pups.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Those are all great questions.</p>
<p>And we don&rsquo;t know the answer to most of them.</p>
<p>What I can say is that a nursing mother</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t have to have her pups with her in the cage</p>
<p>in order to attack an intruder male or an intruder female.</p>
<p>She is just in a state of brain</p>
<p>that makes her aggressive to any intruder.</p>
<p>And those aggression neurons in that female&rsquo;s brain</p>
<p>are activated by both male and female intruders equally.</p>
<p>Whereas in male mice,</p>
<p>the aggression neurons are only ever activated by males,</p>
<p>not by females,</p>
<p>because males are never supposed to attack females.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re only supposed to mate with them.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s another difference in how those neurons</p>
<p>are tuned to signals from different conspecifics.</p>
<p>Does it require lactation?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know the answer to that.</p>
<p>I think there are some experiments</p>
<p>where people have tried to, classical experiments,</p>
<p>people have tried to reproduce the changes in hormones</p>
<p>that occur during pregnancy in female rats</p>
<p>to see if it can make them aggressive.</p>
<p>And some of those manipulations do to some extent,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a whole biology there</p>
<p>that remains to be explored</p>
<p>about how much of this is hormones,</p>
<p>how much of this is circuitry and electricity,</p>
<p>and how much of it is other factors</p>
<p>that we haven&rsquo;t identified yet.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to anthropomorphize,</p>
<p>but well, I&rsquo;ll just ask the question.</p>
<p>So the other day I was watching ferrets mate, right?</p>
<p>The mustelids, they&rsquo;re mustelids and they&rsquo;re mating behavior.</p>
<p>I guess I didn&rsquo;t say why I was watching this.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>It simply doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>But if one observes the mating behaviors</p>
<p>of different animals,</p>
<p>we know that there&rsquo;s a tremendous range</p>
<p>of mating behaviors in humans.</p>
<p>There can be no aggressive component.</p>
<p>There could be aggressive component.</p>
<p>Humans have all sorts of kinks and fetishes and behaviors,</p>
<p>and most of which probably has never been documented</p>
<p>because most of this happens in private.</p>
<p>And here I always say on this podcast,</p>
<p>anytime we&rsquo;re talking about sexual behavior in humans,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re always making the presumption</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s consensual, age appropriate,</p>
<p>context appropriate, and species appropriate.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say we&rsquo;re talking about a lot of different species.</p>
<p>With that said, just to set context,</p>
<p>I was watching this video of ferrets mating,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s quite violent, actually.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of neck biting.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of squealing.</p>
<p>If I were gonna project an anthropomorphize,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s not really clear they both want to be there.</p>
<p>You would just, one would make that assumption.</p>
<p>And of course we don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>We have no idea.</p>
<p>This could be the ritual.</p>
<p>It seems to me that there is some crossover</p>
<p>of aggression and mating behavior circuitry</p>
<p>during the act of the mating.</p>
<p>And do you think that reflects this sort of</p>
<p>stew of competing neurons</p>
<p>that are prioritizing in real time?</p>
<p>Because of course, as states, they have persistence,</p>
<p>as you point out, and you can imagine</p>
<p>that states overlapping, four different states,</p>
<p>the motivational drive to mate,</p>
<p>the motivational drive to get away from this experience,</p>
<p>the motivational drive to eat at some point,</p>
<p>to defecate at some point,</p>
<p>all of these things are competing.</p>
<p>And what we&rsquo;re really seeing is a bias in probabilities.</p>
<p>But when you look at mating behavior of various animals,</p>
<p>you see an aggressive component sometimes, but not always.</p>
<p>Is it species specific?</p>
<p>Is it context specific?</p>
<p>And more generally, do you think that there is crosstalk</p>
<p>between these different neuronal populations</p>
<p>and the animal itself might be kind of confused</p>
<p>about what&rsquo;s going on?</p>
<p>Right, great, great questions.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t really speak to the issue</p>
<p>of whether this is species specific</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m not a naturalist or a zoologist.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen like you have in the wild,</p>
<p>for example, lions when they mate,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen them in Africa,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s often a biting component of that as well.</p>
<p>One of the things that surprised us</p>
<p>when we identified neurons in VMHVL</p>
<p>that control aggression in males</p>
<p>is that within that population,</p>
<p>there is a subset of neurons that is activated by females</p>
<p>during male-female mating encounters.</p>
<p>Now, you don&rsquo;t generally think of mouse sex as rough sex,</p>
<p>but there is a lot of what superficially looks</p>
<p>like violent behavior sometimes,</p>
<p>especially if the female rejects the male and runs away.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s some evidence</p>
<p>that those female selective neurons in VMH</p>
<p>are part of the mating behavior.</p>
<p>If you shut them down,</p>
<p>the animals don&rsquo;t mate as effectively</p>
<p>as they otherwise would.</p>
<p>What happens when you stimulate them,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t yet know because we don&rsquo;t have a way</p>
<p>to specifically do that</p>
<p>without activating the male aggression neurons.</p>
<p>But I think they must be there for a reason</p>
<p>because VMH is not traditionally the brain region</p>
<p>to which male sexual behavior has been assigned.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s another area called the medial preoptic area.</p>
<p>And there we have shown that there are neurons</p>
<p>that definitely stimulate mating behavior.</p>
<p>In fact, if we activate those mating neurons in a male</p>
<p>while it&rsquo;s in the middle of attacking another male,</p>
<p>it will stop fighting, start singing to that male,</p>
<p>and start to try to mount that male</p>
<p>until we shut those neurons off.</p>
<p>So those are the make-love-not-war neurons</p>
<p>and VMH are the make-war-not-love neurons.</p>
<p>And there are dense interconnections</p>
<p>between these two nuclei,</p>
<p>which are very close to each other in the brain.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve shown that some of those connections</p>
<p>are mutually inhibitory to prevent the animal</p>
<p>from attacking a mate that it&rsquo;s supposed to be mating with</p>
<p>or to prevent it from mating</p>
<p>with an animal it&rsquo;s supposed to be attacking.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s also possible</p>
<p>that there are some cooperative interactions</p>
<p>between those structures</p>
<p>as well as antagonistic interactions.</p>
<p>And the balance of whether it&rsquo;s the cooperative</p>
<p>or antagonistic interactions</p>
<p>that are firing at any given moment in a mating encounter,</p>
<p>as you suggest, may determine whether a moment</p>
<p>of coital bliss among two lions</p>
<p>may suddenly turn into a snap or a growl</p>
<p>and a bearing of fangs.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know that, but certainly the substrate,</p>
<p>the wiring is there for that to happen.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure people&rsquo;s minds are running wild with all this.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just use this as an opportunity</p>
<p>to raise something I&rsquo;ve wondered about for far too long,</p>
<p>which is I have a friend who&rsquo;s a psychiatrist</p>
<p>who works on the treatment of fetishes.</p>
<p>This is not a psychiatrist that I was treated by.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just point that out.</p>
<p>But they mentioned something very interesting to me long ago</p>
<p>which is that when you look at true fetishes</p>
<p>and what meets the criteria for fetish,</p>
<p>that there does seem to be some,</p>
<p>what one would think would be competing circuitry</p>
<p>that suddenly becomes aligned.</p>
<p>For instance, avoidance of feces, dead bodies, feet,</p>
<p>things that are very infectious.</p>
<p>Typically, those states of disgust</p>
<p>are antagonistic to states of desire</p>
<p>as one would hope is present during sexual behavior.</p>
<p>Fetishes often involve exactly those things</p>
<p>that are aversive, feet, dead bodies,</p>
<p>disgusting things to most people.</p>
<p>And true fetishes in the pathologic sense</p>
<p>exist when people have basically a requirement</p>
<p>for thinking about or even the presence</p>
<p>of those ordinarily disgusting things</p>
<p>in order to become sexually aroused.</p>
<p>As if the circuitry has crossed over.</p>
<p>And the statement that rung in my mind</p>
<p>was people don&rsquo;t develop fetishes to mailboxes</p>
<p>or to the color red or to random objects and things.</p>
<p>They develop fetishes to things that are highly infectious</p>
<p>and counter reproductive appetitive states.</p>
<p>So I find that interesting.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you have any reflections on that</p>
<p>as to why that might be.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m tempted to ask whether or not you&rsquo;ve ever observed</p>
<p>fetish-like behavior in mice,</p>
<p>but I find it fascinating that you have this area</p>
<p>of the brain that&rsquo;s so highly conserved,</p>
<p>the hypothalamus,</p>
<p>which you have these dense populations intermixed</p>
<p>and that the addition of a forebrain,</p>
<p>especially in humans that can think and make decisions</p>
<p>could in some ways facilitate</p>
<p>the expression of these primitive behaviors,</p>
<p>but could also complicate</p>
<p>the expression of primitive behaviors.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I would agree.</p>
<p>I think one way of looking at fetishes</p>
<p>from a neurobiological standpoint</p>
<p>is that they represent a kind of appetitive conditioning</p>
<p>where something that is natively aversive or disgusting</p>
<p>by being repeatedly paired with a rewarding experience</p>
<p>changes its valence, its sign,</p>
<p>so that now it somehow produces the anticipation of reward</p>
<p>the next time a person sees it.</p>
<p>Now, I don&rsquo;t know that literature in animals,</p>
<p>so I don&rsquo;t know if you could condition a mouse</p>
<p>to eat feces, for example,</p>
<p>although there are animals that are naturally coprophagic.</p>
<p>That is, and maybe mice do that occasionally.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure, but that is one way to think about it.</p>
<p>And that could certainly involve in humans,</p>
<p>the more recently evolved parts of the brain,</p>
<p>the cortex that is sort of orchestrating</p>
<p>both what behaviors are happening</p>
<p>and whether reward states are turning on</p>
<p>in association with those behaviors that are happening.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the part that I think is difficult</p>
<p>and challenging to study in a mouse,</p>
<p>but certainly bears thinking about</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a really interesting,</p>
<p>again, sort of counterintuitive aspect,</p>
<p>again, like rough sex,</p>
<p>people that want to have fighting or violence</p>
<p>or aggressiveness in order to be sexually aroused</p>
<p>and fetishes.</p>
<p>And in fact, when we made that discovery initially,</p>
<p>it raised the question in my mind</p>
<p>whether some people that are serial rapists, for example,</p>
<p>and engage in sexual violence</p>
<p>might in some level have their wires crossed in some way</p>
<p>that these states that are supposed to be</p>
<p>pretty much separated and mutually antagonistic are not</p>
<p>and are actually more rewarding and reinforcing.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s gonna be a long time</p>
<p>before we have figured it out.</p>
<p>But when you think about it,</p>
<p>there is no treatment that we have</p>
<p>for a violent sexual offender that eliminates the violence,</p>
<p>but not the sexual desire and sexual urge.</p>
<p>Whether it&rsquo;s physical castration or chemical castration,</p>
<p>it eliminates both.</p>
<p>Definitely an area that I think,</p>
<p>well, human neuroscience in general</p>
<p>needs a lot of tools, right?</p>
<p>In terms of how to probe and manipulate neural circuitry.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to turn to this area that you mentioned,</p>
<p>the medial preoptic area.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m fascinated by it because just as within the VMH,</p>
<p>you have these neurons for mating and fighting</p>
<p>or aggression.</p>
<p>My understanding is medial preoptic area</p>
<p>contains neurons for mating,</p>
<p>but also for temperature regulation.</p>
<p>And perhaps I&rsquo;m making too much of a leap here,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve always wondered about this phrase in heat.</p>
<p>As certainly the menstrual and,</p>
<p>or estrous cycle in females</p>
<p>is related to changes in body temperature.</p>
<p>In fact, measuring body temperature is one way</p>
<p>that women can fairly reliably predict ovulation, et cetera.</p>
<p>Although additional,</p>
<p>this is not a show about contraception.</p>
<p>Please rely on multiple methods as necessary.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t use this discussion</p>
<p>as your guide for contraception based on temperature.</p>
<p>But if you stimulate certain neurons</p>
<p>in the medial preoptic area,</p>
<p>you can trigger dramatic changes in body temperature</p>
<p>and or mating behavior.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the relationship, if any,</p>
<p>between temperature and mating,</p>
<p>or do we simply not know?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what the relationship is</p>
<p>between temperature and mating neurons</p>
<p>in the preoptic area.</p>
<p>I suspect that they are different populations of neurons</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s become pretty clear</p>
<p>that the preoptic area has many different subsets</p>
<p>of neurons that are specifically active</p>
<p>during different behaviors,</p>
<p>even different phases of mating behavior.</p>
<p>So there are mounting neurons,</p>
<p>there are intermission thrusting neurons</p>
<p>and ejaculation neurons and sniffing neurons.</p>
<p>Wait, wait.</p>
<p>So I think I&rsquo;ve heard this before,</p>
<p>but I just want to make sure that people get this.</p>
<p>I want to make sure I get this.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re telling me within medial preoptic area,</p>
<p>there are specific neurons that if you stimulate them</p>
<p>will make males thrust as if they&rsquo;re mating?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>So this is not based on stimulation experiments.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s based on imaging experiments right now</p>
<p>that we see when we look in the preoptic area</p>
<p>at what neurons are active</p>
<p>during different phases of aggression.</p>
<p>We see that there are different neurons</p>
<p>that are active during sniffing,</p>
<p>mounting, thrusting, and ejaculation,</p>
<p>and they become repeatedly activated</p>
<p>each time the animal goes through that cycle.</p>
<p>During mating.</p>
<p>During the mating cycle.</p>
<p>There are also some neurons there</p>
<p>that are active during aggression, which are distinct.</p>
<p>And we don&rsquo;t know whether those neurons are there</p>
<p>to promote aggression or to inhibit mating</p>
<p>when animals are fighting.</p>
<p>We have some evidence that suggests it may be the latter,</p>
<p>but we don&rsquo;t know for sure yet.</p>
<p>The thermosensitive neurons are really interesting</p>
<p>because you mentioned the phrase in heat,</p>
<p>and then in the context of aggression,</p>
<p>you talk about hot-blooded people or hotheads.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just recently a paper showing</p>
<p>there are thermoregulatory neurons in VMH as well.</p>
<p>So all of these homeostatic systems for metabolic control</p>
<p>and temperature control are intermingled in these nuclei,</p>
<p>these zones that control these basic survival behaviors</p>
<p>like mating and aggression and predator defense.</p>
<p>And I would imagine that the thermoregulation</p>
<p>is tightly connected to energy expenditure,</p>
<p>and that, again, these neurons are mixed together</p>
<p>to facilitate integration of all these signals by the brain</p>
<p>in some way that we don&rsquo;t understand</p>
<p>to maintain the proper balance between energy conservation</p>
<p>and energy consumption during this particular behavior</p>
<p>or that behavior.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;ve always been fascinated by the question,</p>
<p>why is it that violence goes up in the summertime</p>
<p>when the temperatures are high?</p>
<p>Does it really have something to do with the idea</p>
<p>that increased temperature increases violence?</p>
<p>It seems hard to believe because we&rsquo;re homeothermic</p>
<p>and we pretty much stay around 98.6 Fahrenheit.</p>
<p>Could be other social reasons why that happens.</p>
<p>People are outside out on the street</p>
<p>bumping into each other.</p>
<p>But I think there could well be something</p>
<p>that ties thermoregulation to aggressiveness</p>
<p>as well as to mating behavior.</p>
<p>Fascinating, yeah.</p>
<p>I asked in the hopes that maybe in the years to come,</p>
<p>your lab will parse some of the temperature relationships.</p>
<p>And I realized it could be also regulated by hormones</p>
<p>in general, so it&rsquo;s tapping into two systems</p>
<p>for completely different reasons.</p>
<p>But anyway, an area that intrigued me</p>
<p>because of this notion of hotheadedness</p>
<p>or cool, calm, and collected.</p>
<p>And also the fact that,</p>
<p>I probably should have asked about this earlier,</p>
<p>that arousal itself is tethered</p>
<p>to the whole mating and reproductive process.</p>
<p>I mean, without a sort of seesawing back</p>
<p>between the sympathetic and parasympathetic,</p>
<p>arousal relaxed states,</p>
<p>there is no mating that will take place.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s fascinating the way these different</p>
<p>competing forces and seesaws operate.</p>
<p>Several times during the discussion so far,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve hit on this idea that the same behavior</p>
<p>can reflect different states</p>
<p>and different states can converge</p>
<p>on multiple behaviors as well.</p>
<p>You had a paper not long ago about mounting behavior,</p>
<p>which I found fascinating.</p>
<p>Maybe you could tell us about that result.</p>
<p>Because to me, it really speaks to the fact</p>
<p>that mounting behavior can, in one context, be sexual,</p>
<p>and in another context actually be related</p>
<p>to, we presume, dominance.</p>
<p>And I think that my friends who practice jujitsu</p>
<p>will say, when I talk about that result,</p>
<p>they say, of course,</p>
<p>mounting the other person and dominating them,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s nothing sexual about it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about overtaking them physically,</p>
<p>literally being on their next side</p>
<p>as opposed to lying on their own back.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fascinating, very primitive,</p>
<p>and yet I think speaks to this idea</p>
<p>that mounting behavior might be one</p>
<p>of the most fundamental ways in which animals</p>
<p>and perhaps even humans express dominance</p>
<p>and or sexual interactions.</p>
<p>Yep, that&rsquo;s a fascinating question.</p>
<p>And it was harder to figure out than you might&rsquo;ve thought.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s been this debate for a long time</p>
<p>in the field when you see two male mice</p>
<p>mounting each other, is this homosexual behavior?</p>
<p>Is this a case of mistaken sexual identification?</p>
<p>Or is this dominance behavior?</p>
<p>And if you train an AI algorithm</p>
<p>to try to distinguish male-male mounting</p>
<p>from male-female mounting, it does not do a very good job</p>
<p>because motorically, those behaviors look so similar.</p>
<p>And so how did we wind up figuring out</p>
<p>that most male-male mounting is dominance mounting?</p>
<p>There are two important clues.</p>
<p>One is the context.</p>
<p>And so male-male mounting tends to be more prominent</p>
<p>among mice when they haven&rsquo;t had a lot</p>
<p>of fighting experience.</p>
<p>And then as they become more experienced in fighting,</p>
<p>they will show relatively less mounting</p>
<p>towards the other male and more attack.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ll transition quickly from mounting to attack.</p>
<p>And so the mounting is always seen in this context</p>
<p>of an overall aggressive interaction.</p>
<p>And then the second thing, which believe it or not</p>
<p>was suggested by a computational theoretical person</p>
<p>in my lab, Ann Kennedy,</p>
<p>who now has her own lab at Northwestern.</p>
<p>She said, well, males are known to sing</p>
<p>when they mount females, ultrasonic vocalizations.</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t you see what kinds of songs they&rsquo;re singing</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re mounting males?</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s a different kind of song.</p>
<p>Well, what we found out is they don&rsquo;t sing at all</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re mounting a male.</p>
<p>So you can easily distinguish whether mounting behavior</p>
<p>by a male mouse is reproductive or agonistic,</p>
<p>aggressive, according to whether it&rsquo;s accompanied</p>
<p>by ultrasonic vocalizations or not.</p>
<p>And it turns out that different brain regions</p>
<p>are maximally active</p>
<p>during these different types of mounting.</p>
<p>So VMH, the aggression locus,</p>
<p>is actually active during dominance mounting,</p>
<p>and you can stimulate mounting if you,</p>
<p>dominance mounting, if you weakly activate VMH.</p>
<p>Whereas MPOA is most strongly activated</p>
<p>during sexual mounting,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s always accompanied</p>
<p>by the ultrasonic vocalization.</p>
<p>So this shows how difficult and dangerous it can be</p>
<p>to try to infer an animal&rsquo;s state or intent or emotion</p>
<p>from the behavior that it&rsquo;s exhibiting,</p>
<p>because the same behavior can mean very different things,</p>
<p>depending on the context</p>
<p>of the interaction with the animal.</p>
<p>And I would say even more so with when that animal</p>
<p>is a human or is multiple humans.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>And there are many examples.</p>
<p>Animals show chasing to obtain food,</p>
<p>a prey animal that they&rsquo;re gonna kill and eat,</p>
<p>and they show chasing to obtain a mate</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re gonna have sex with.</p>
<p>And so the intent of the chasing is completely different.</p>
<p>And we don&rsquo;t know in all these cases</p>
<p>whether there are separate circuits</p>
<p>or common circuits that are being activated.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m obsessed with dogs and dog breeds and et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p>And one thing I can tell you</p>
<p>is that female dogs will mount and thrust.</p>
<p>We had a female pit bull mix, a very sweet dog,</p>
<p>but in observing her, it convinced me</p>
<p>that one can never assume that male dogs</p>
<p>are more aggressive than female dogs.</p>
<p>It turns out in talking to people</p>
<p>who are quite skilled at dog genetics and dog breeding,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a dominance hierarchy within a litter,</p>
<p>and it crosses over male-female delineations.</p>
<p>So you can get a female in the litter</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s very dominant, a male that&rsquo;s very subordinate,</p>
<p>and no one really knows what relates to.</p>
<p>This is also why little dogs sometimes</p>
<p>will get right up in the face of a big Doberman Pinscher</p>
<p>and just start barking,</p>
<p>which is an idiotic thing for it to do,</p>
<p>but they can be dominant over a much larger dog.</p>
<p>Very strange to me anyway.</p>
<p>Female-female mounting, do you observe it in mice?</p>
<p>Are there known circuits?</p>
<p>And what evokes female-female mounting,</p>
<p>or female-to-male mounting, if it occurs?</p>
<p>Good.</p>
<p>Yes, there is female.</p>
<p>There are clear examples of females</p>
<p>displaying male-type mounting behavior</p>
<p>towards other females.</p>
<p>We see this most commonly in the lab</p>
<p>where we are housing females with their sisters,</p>
<p>say three or four in a cage.</p>
<p>We take one out and we have her mate with a male</p>
<p>where the male&rsquo;s doing the mounting.</p>
<p>Now we take that female and we put her back in the cage</p>
<p>with her litter mates and she starts mounting them.</p>
<p>Now what the function of that is,</p>
<p>if it has any function, or what it means,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s driving it, we don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>But we do know that if we stimulate</p>
<p>the neurons that control mounting in males</p>
<p>in the medial preoptic area,</p>
<p>if we stimulate that same population in females,</p>
<p>it evokes male-type mounting</p>
<p>towards either a male or a female target.</p>
<p>In fact, we have a movie where we have a female</p>
<p>that has just been mounted by a male,</p>
<p>so the male&rsquo;s on top and she&rsquo;s underneath,</p>
<p>and we stimulate that region of MPOA in the female,</p>
<p>and she crawls out from underneath the male</p>
<p>who has just mounted her, circles around behind him,</p>
<p>and climbs up on top of him,</p>
<p>and starts to try to mount him and thrust at him.</p>
<p>That has a name online, it&rsquo;s called a switch.</p>
<p>Is that right?</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t ask me how I know that.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s a pretty, yeah, it&rsquo;s a term that you hear.</p>
<p>You also hear the term topping from the bottom,</p>
<p>which it sounds like that is a literal topping</p>
<p>from the bottom. I see.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s more of a psychological phrase from what I hear.</p>
<p>I have friends that are educating me in this language,</p>
<p>mostly because I find this kind</p>
<p>of neurobiological discussion fascinating.</p>
<p>At some point, right, I attempt in my mind</p>
<p>to superimpose observations from the online communities</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m told about and asked about to this,</p>
<p>but I should point out it&rsquo;s always dangerous,</p>
<p>and in fact, inappropriate to make a one-to-one link.</p>
<p>Humans are, they maintain all the same neural circuitry</p>
<p>and pathways that we&rsquo;re talking about today in mice,</p>
<p>but that forebrain does allow for context, et cetera.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>So what the function is of female mounting, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>It could be a type of dominance display.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to measure that because people haven&rsquo;t worked</p>
<p>on female dominance hierarchies to the same extent</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;ve worked on male dominance hierarchies,</p>
<p>but it indicates that the circuits</p>
<p>for male type mounting are there in females</p>
<p>as early work from Catherine Duloc suggested some years ago.</p>
<p>Fascinating, fascinating.</p>
<p>I love that paper because as you pointed out for chase,</p>
<p>for mounting behavior, we see it</p>
<p>and we think one thing specifically.</p>
<p>And after hearing this result,</p>
<p>actually, I&rsquo;m not a big fan of fight sports.</p>
<p>I watch them occasionally because friends are into them,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve seen boxing matches, MMA matches,</p>
<p>where at the end of a round,</p>
<p>if someone felt that they dominated,</p>
<p>they will do the unsportsmanlike thing of thrusting</p>
<p>on the back of the other person before they get off,</p>
<p>almost like I dominated you.</p>
<p>And so mimicking sexual-like behavior,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s no reason to think that it&rsquo;s sexual,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re sending a message of dominance is what implies.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to talk about something slightly off</p>
<p>from this circuitry, but I think that&rsquo;s related</p>
<p>to the circuitry, at least in some way,</p>
<p>which is this structure that I&rsquo;ve always been fascinated by</p>
<p>and I can&rsquo;t figure out what the hell it&rsquo;s for</p>
<p>because it seems to be involved in everything,</p>
<p>which is the PAG, the periaqueductal gray,</p>
<p>which is a little bit further back in the brain</p>
<p>for people that don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been studied in the context of pain.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been studied in the context</p>
<p>of the so-called lordosis response,</p>
<p>the receptivity or arching of the back of the female</p>
<p>to receive intromission and mating from the male.</p>
<p>How should we think about PAG?</p>
<p>Clearly it can&rsquo;t be involved in everything.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m guessing it&rsquo;s at least as complex</p>
<p>as some of these other regions that we&rsquo;ve been talking about,</p>
<p>different types of neurons controlling different things,</p>
<p>but how does PAG play into this?</p>
<p>In particular, I wanna know,</p>
<p>is there some mechanism of pain modulation and control</p>
<p>during fighting and or mating?</p>
<p>And the reason I ask is that,</p>
<p>while I&rsquo;m not a combat sports person,</p>
<p>years ago I did a little bit of martial arts</p>
<p>and it always was impressive to me</p>
<p>how little it hurt to get punched during a fight</p>
<p>and how much it hurt afterwards, right?</p>
<p>So there clearly is some endogenous pain control</p>
<p>that then wears off and then you feel beat up.</p>
<p>At least in my case, I felt beat up.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s PAG doing vis-a-vis pain</p>
<p>and what&rsquo;s pain doing vis-a-vis these other behaviors?</p>
<p>Good, good.</p>
<p>So I think of PAG like a old-fashioned term</p>
<p>telephone switchboard, where there are calls coming in</p>
<p>and then the cables have to be punched into the right hole</p>
<p>to get the information to be routed to the right recipient</p>
<p>on the other end of it.</p>
<p>Because pretty much every type of innate behavior</p>
<p>you can think of has had the PAG implicated.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a whole literature showing the involvement</p>
<p>of the PAG in fear, different regions of the PAG,</p>
<p>the dorsal PAG is involved in panic-like behavior,</p>
<p>running away, the ventral PAG is involved</p>
<p>in freezing behavior.</p>
<p>Both the MPOA and VMH send projections to the PAG</p>
<p>to different regions of the PAG.</p>
<p>So in cross-section, I hate to say this,</p>
<p>but in cross-section, the PAG kind of looks like the water</p>
<p>in a toilet when you&rsquo;re standing over an open toilet bowl.</p>
<p>And if you imagine a clock face projected onto that,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like the PAG has sectors from one to 12,</p>
<p>maybe even more of them.</p>
<p>And in each of those sectors, you find different neurons</p>
<p>from the hypothalamus are projecting.</p>
<p>So could turn out that there is a topographic arrangement</p>
<p>along the dorsal ventral axis of the PAG</p>
<p>and the medial lateral axis of the PAG</p>
<p>that determines the type of behavior</p>
<p>that will be emitted when neurons</p>
<p>in that region are stimulated.</p>
<p>And I think sort of all of the evidence</p>
<p>is pointing in that direction,</p>
<p>but by no means has it been mapped out.</p>
<p>Now, the thing that you mentioned about it not hurting</p>
<p>when you got beat up during martial arts,</p>
<p>there is a well-known phenomenon</p>
<p>called fear-induced analgesia,</p>
<p>where when an animal is in a high state of fear,</p>
<p>like if it&rsquo;s trying to defend itself,</p>
<p>there is a suppression of pain responses.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not sure completely about the mechanisms</p>
<p>and how well that&rsquo;s understood,</p>
<p>but for example, the adrenal gland has a peptide in it</p>
<p>that is released from the adrenal medulla,</p>
<p>which controls the fight or flight responses,</p>
<p>and that peptide has analgesic activities.</p>
<p>Now, whether- Ask what that peptide is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called bovine adrenal medullary peptide</p>
<p>of 22 amino acid residues.</p>
<p>And I only know about it because it activates a receptor</p>
<p>that we discovered many years ago that&rsquo;s involved in pain,</p>
<p>and we thought it promoted pain,</p>
<p>but it turns out that this actually inhibits pain.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like an endogenous analgesic.</p>
<p>Whether this is happening,</p>
<p>this type of analgesia is happening</p>
<p>when an animal is engaged in offensive aggression</p>
<p>or in mating behavior, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>but it certainly is possible.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know whether these analgesic mechanisms</p>
<p>are happening in the PAG.</p>
<p>They could also be happening</p>
<p>a little further down in the spinal cord.</p>
<p>The PAG is really continuous with the spinal cord.</p>
<p>If you just follow it down towards the tail of an animal,</p>
<p>you will wind up in the spinal cord.</p>
<p>And so it could be that there are influences</p>
<p>acting at many levels on pain in the PAG</p>
<p>and in the spinal cord as well.</p>
<p>And it may well be known.</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t know it.</p>
<p>I want to distinguish clearly between things</p>
<p>that are not known, that I know are unknown,</p>
<p>which is in a fairly small area where I have expertise</p>
<p>from things that may be known, but I&rsquo;m ignorant of them</p>
<p>because I just don&rsquo;t have a broad enough knowledge base</p>
<p>to know that.</p>
<p>Sure, we appreciate those delineations.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>A PAG, I think this description of it</p>
<p>is an old-fashioned telephone switchboard.</p>
<p>And now every time I look into the toilet,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll think about the periaqueductal gray.</p>
<p>And every time I see an image of periaqueductal gray,</p>
<p>I think about a toilet.</p>
<p>That is an excellent description</p>
<p>because in fact, I drew a circle</p>
<p>with a little thing at the bottom.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;ll put a post or link to a picture of PAG</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll understand why David and I are chuckling here</p>
<p>because indeed it looks like a toilet</p>
<p>when staring into a toilet.</p>
<p>Tell us about tachykinin.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked about this a couple of times</p>
<p>on different podcast episodes</p>
<p>because of its relationship to social isolation.</p>
<p>And in part, because the podcast was launched</p>
<p>during a time when there was more social isolation.</p>
<p>My understanding is that tachykinin,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll tell us what it is in a moment,</p>
<p>is present in flies and mice and in humans</p>
<p>and may do similar things in those species.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>So tachykinin refers to a family of related neuropeptides.</p>
<p>So these are brain chemicals.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re different from dopamine and serotonin</p>
<p>in that they&rsquo;re not small organic molecules.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re actually short pieces of protein</p>
<p>that are directly encoded by genes</p>
<p>that are active in specific neurons and not in others.</p>
<p>And when those neurons are active,</p>
<p>those neuropeptides are released together</p>
<p>with classical transmitters like glutamate, whatever.</p>
<p>Tachykinins have been famously implicated in pain,</p>
<p>particularly tachykinin-1, which is called substance P,</p>
<p>one of the original pain modulating.</p>
<p>This is something that promotes inflammatory pain,</p>
<p>but there are other tachykinin genes.</p>
<p>In mice, there are two.</p>
<p>In humans, I think there are three.</p>
<p>And in Drosophila, there&rsquo;s one.</p>
<p>And the way we got into tachykinins</p>
<p>is from studying aggression in flies.</p>
<p>We thought since neuropeptides have this remarkable</p>
<p>parallel evolutionary conservation of structure</p>
<p>and function, like neuropeptide Y controls feeding</p>
<p>in worms, in flies, and mice, and in people.</p>
<p>Oxytocin-like peptides control reproduction</p>
<p>in worms and mice and in people.</p>
<p>We thought we might find peptides that control aggression</p>
<p>in flies and in people.</p>
<p>And so we did a screen, unbiased screen of peptides</p>
<p>and found indeed that one of the tachykinins,</p>
<p>Drosophila tachykinin, those neurons,</p>
<p>when you activate them, strongly promote aggression.</p>
<p>And it depends on the release of tachykinin.</p>
<p>Now, the interesting thing is that in flies,</p>
<p>just like in people and practically any other social animal</p>
<p>that shows aggression,</p>
<p>social isolation increases aggressiveness.</p>
<p>So putting a violent prisoner in solitary confinement</p>
<p>is absolutely the worst, most counterproductive thing</p>
<p>you could do to them.</p>
<p>And indeed, we found in flies that social isolation</p>
<p>increases the level of tachykinin in the brain.</p>
<p>And if we shut that gene down,</p>
<p>it prevents the isolation from increasing aggression.</p>
<p>So since my lab also works on mice,</p>
<p>it was natural to see whether tachykinins</p>
<p>might be upregulated in social isolation</p>
<p>and whether they play a role in aggression.</p>
<p>And this is work done by a former postdoc,</p>
<p>Muriel Zelikowski, now at University of Salt Lake City</p>
<p>in Utah.</p>
<p>And she found remarkably that when mice</p>
<p>are socially isolated for two weeks,</p>
<p>there is this massive upregulation of tachykinin-2</p>
<p>in their brain.</p>
<p>In fact, if you tag the peptide</p>
<p>with a green fluorescent protein</p>
<p>from a jellyfish genetically,</p>
<p>the brain looks green when the mice are socially isolated</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s so much of this stuff released.</p>
<p>And she went on to show that that increase in tachykinin</p>
<p>is responsible for the effect of social isolation</p>
<p>to increase aggressiveness and to increase fear</p>
<p>and to increase anxiety.</p>
<p>And in fact, there are drugs that block the receptor</p>
<p>for tachykinin, which were tested in humans</p>
<p>and abandoned because they had no efficacy</p>
<p>in the tests that they were analyzed for.</p>
<p>If you give those drugs to a socially isolated mouse,</p>
<p>it blocks all of the effects of social isolation.</p>
<p>It blocks the aggression, it blocks the increased fear</p>
<p>and the increased anxiety.</p>
<p>And Muriel described it, the mice just look chill.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a sedative, which is really important.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that the mice are going to sleep.</p>
<p>Most remarkably is once you socially isolate a mouse</p>
<p>and it becomes aggressive,</p>
<p>you can never put it back in its cage with its brothers</p>
<p>from its litter because it will kill them all overnight.</p>
<p>But if you give it this drug, which is called Osanatant</p>
<p>that blocks tachykinin too,</p>
<p>that mouse can be returned to the cage with its brothers</p>
<p>and will not attack them and seems to be happy about that</p>
<p>for the rest of the time.</p>
<p>So this is an incredibly powerful effect of this drug.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve been really interested</p>
<p>in trying to get pharmaceutical companies to test this drug,</p>
<p>which has a really good safety profile in humans,</p>
<p>in testing it in people who are subjected</p>
<p>to social isolation stress or bereavement stress.</p>
<p>And this is one of the areas where I learned</p>
<p>an eye-opening lesson as a basic scientist</p>
<p>who naively thought that if you make a discovery</p>
<p>and it has translational applications to humans</p>
<p>that pharmaceutical companies</p>
<p>are gonna be falling all over themselves to try it.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re not interested because once burned, twice shy.</p>
<p>These drugs were tested for efficacy in schizophrenia.</p>
<p>I have no idea why.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s very little preclinical data to suggest that.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, they failed.</p>
<p>When a drug fails in clinical trials in phase three,</p>
<p>it costs $100 million to the company</p>
<p>that carried out that clinical trial.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a huge slag heap of discarded pharmaceuticals,</p>
<p>many of them inhibitors of neuropeptide action</p>
<p>that could be useful in other indications</p>
<p>such as the one we discovered,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a huge economic disincentive</p>
<p>for pharmaceutical companies to test them again</p>
<p>because the conclusion that they drew</p>
<p>from all these failed tests,</p>
<p>particularly in the 2010s and before that,</p>
<p>is that the reason they failed</p>
<p>is because animal experiments with drugs</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t predict how humans will respond to the drugs.</p>
<p>And therefore, we shouldn&rsquo;t try to extrapolate</p>
<p>from any other data that we get from animal experiments,</p>
<p>mouse or rat experiments to humans</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;ll lead us down the wrong track.</p>
<p>And I think that that is probably wrong.</p>
<p>In some cases, it may be right,</p>
<p>but in other cases, there&rsquo;s good reason to think</p>
<p>because these brain regions and molecules</p>
<p>are so evolutionarily conserved</p>
<p>that they ought to be playing a similar role in humans.</p>
<p>In fact, there is a paper showing</p>
<p>that in humans that have borderline personality disorder,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a strong correlation</p>
<p>between their self-reported level of aggressiveness</p>
<p>and serum levels of a tachykinin,</p>
<p>in this case, tachykinin-1,</p>
<p>as detected by radioimmunoassay.</p>
<p>This is work of Emil Coccaro,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s a clinical psychiatrist at the University of Chicago.</p>
<p>So there is a smoking gun in the case of humans as well.</p>
<p>And I was actually trying to interest</p>
<p>a pharmaceutical company that was testing these drugs,</p>
<p>actually, for treatment of hot flashes in females,</p>
<p>in humans, where there is actually good animal data</p>
<p>to think that it might be useful.</p>
<p>But I realized that this clinical trial</p>
<p>was going on during the COVID pandemic.</p>
<p>And I approached him and said,</p>
<p>look, nature may have actually done for you</p>
<p>the experiment that I want you to do</p>
<p>because some of the people who are getting drug or placebo</p>
<p>are gonna have been socially isolated,</p>
<p>and some of them will have not.</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t you get them to fill out questionnaires</p>
<p>and see whether the ones who were given the drug</p>
<p>and socially isolated felt less stressed and less anxious</p>
<p>than the ones who were not socially isolated,</p>
<p>and they would not touch it</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re in the middle of a clinical trial</p>
<p>for a different indication for this drug,</p>
<p>and they have to report any observation</p>
<p>that they make about that drug in their patient population.</p>
<p>So if they were to ask these questions</p>
<p>and get an unfavorable answer,</p>
<p>oh my God, I felt even worse when I took this drug</p>
<p>and I was isolated,</p>
<p>they would be obliged to report that to the FDA,</p>
<p>and that could torpedo the chances</p>
<p>for the drug being approved</p>
<p>in the thing that it was in clinical trials for.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s better not to ask and not to know</p>
<p>than it is to try to find out more information</p>
<p>that could lead to another clinical indication.</p>
<p>So I remain convinced that this family of drugs</p>
<p>could have very powerful uses in treating some forms</p>
<p>of stress-induced anxiety or aggressiveness in humans,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s just very difficult for economic reasons</p>
<p>to find a way to get somebody to test that.</p>
<p>Yeah, a true shame that these companies won&rsquo;t do this,</p>
<p>and especially given the fact</p>
<p>that many of these drugs exist</p>
<p>and their safety profiles are established,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s always a serious consideration</p>
<p>when embarking on a clinical trial.</p>
<p>Perhaps in hearing this discussion,</p>
<p>someone out there will understand</p>
<p>the key importance of this and will reach out to us,</p>
<p>will provide ways to do that</p>
<p>to get such a study going in humans.</p>
<p>Because I think if enough laboratories</p>
<p>ran small-scale clinical trials,</p>
<p>pharma certainly would perk up their ears, right?</p>
<p>I mean, they&rsquo;re so strategic sometimes to their own.</p>
<p>I mean, I would like to say also,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to see this tested on pets.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s a huge number of pets right now</p>
<p>that are suffering separation anxiety</p>
<p>because humans bought them to keep them company</p>
<p>during the COVID pandemic.</p>
<p>And now they&rsquo;re home alone.</p>
<p>And now they&rsquo;re home alone, okay?</p>
<p>And if this thing works in mice,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s certainly a higher chance</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna work in dogs or in cats</p>
<p>than it is gonna work in humans.</p>
<p>And if it did, that would be even more encouragement</p>
<p>to continue along those lines.</p>
<p>People sometimes forget that although we work on animals</p>
<p>and we ultimately wanna understand humans,</p>
<p>we care about how our results apply</p>
<p>to the welfare of animals as well,</p>
<p>and particularly domestic pets,</p>
<p>which is a multi-billion dollar industry in this country.</p>
<p>So if there&rsquo;s ways that they can be made to feel better</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re separated from their owners,</p>
<p>that would certainly be a good thing.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>We will put out the call.</p>
<p>We are putting out the call.</p>
<p>And I know for sure there will be a response.</p>
<p>And just underscoring what we&rsquo;ve been talking about</p>
<p>even more, every time we hear about a school shooting,</p>
<p>like in Texas recently,</p>
<p>or I happened to be in New York</p>
<p>during the time when there was a subway shooting,</p>
<p>for whatever reason, I listened to the book about Columbine</p>
<p>that went into a very detailed way</p>
<p>about the origin of those boys and that committed that.</p>
<p>And every single time there&rsquo;s the person</p>
<p>who commits those acts is socially isolated.</p>
<p>As far as I know, there might be some exceptions there.</p>
<p>And sometimes this crosses over</p>
<p>with other mental health issues,</p>
<p>but sometimes no apparent mental health issues.</p>
<p>So social isolation clearly drives powerful neurochemical</p>
<p>and neurobiological changes.</p>
<p>I really hope that tachykinin 1 and 2,</p>
<p>those are the main ones in humans,</p>
<p>will be explored in more detail.</p>
<p>Also, I didn&rsquo;t know that tachykinin 1 is substance P</p>
<p>and substance P is tachykinin 1.</p>
<p>Tachykinin 1 is the gene name,</p>
<p>and tachykinin 2 in humans is called neurokinin B.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the name of the protein.</p>
<p>I just refer to it by the gene name</p>
<p>because it makes it easier,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t have to keep remembering</p>
<p>two names for each thing.</p>
<p>And if I&rsquo;m not mistaken,</p>
<p>you put yourself in the company of geneticists</p>
<p>because of your original training</p>
<p>was in genetics, immunology, and areas related to that.</p>
<p>It was in cell biology,</p>
<p>and I didn&rsquo;t actually have formal training in genetics</p>
<p>as a graduate student,</p>
<p>but I think I&rsquo;m a geneticist at heart.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just the way I like to think about things.</p>
<p>And when I started working on flies,</p>
<p>that sort of, I came out of the closet</p>
<p>as a geneticist, as it were.</p>
<p>Wonderful.</p>
<p>As long as we&rsquo;re talking about humans,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to get your thoughts</p>
<p>about human studies of emotion.</p>
<p>I know you wrote this book with Ralph Adolphs.</p>
<p>You have this new book, which we&rsquo;ll provide a link to,</p>
<p>which I&rsquo;ve read front to back twice.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s phenomenal.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve mentioned it before on the podcast.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really, there are books that are worth reading,</p>
<p>and then there are books that are important.</p>
<p>And I think this book is truly important</p>
<p>for the general population to read and understand,</p>
<p>and neuroscientists should read and understand the contents</p>
<p>because we, as a culture, are way off</p>
<p>in terms of how we think about emotions</p>
<p>and states and behaviors.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ll put a link to that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really worth the time and energy to read it.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s written beautifully, I should say.</p>
<p>Very accessible, even for non-scientists.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a heat map diagram in that book</p>
<p>that I think about.</p>
<p>This is a heat map diagram of subjective reports</p>
<p>that people gave of where they experience an emotion</p>
<p>or a feeling, a somatic feeling in their body</p>
<p>or in their head, or both, when they are angry, sad,</p>
<p>calm, lonely, et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p>And I wouldn&rsquo;t want people to think</p>
<p>that those heat maps were generated</p>
<p>by any physiological measurement because they were not.</p>
<p>And yet, I don&rsquo;t think we can have a discussion</p>
<p>about emotions and states and the sorts of behaviors</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re talking about today</p>
<p>without thinking about the body also.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not coming to this</p>
<p>as a Northern California mind-body.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been to Esalen once.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t go in the baths.</p>
<p>I went there, I gave a talk, and I left.</p>
<p>It is very beautiful.</p>
<p>If anyone wants to know what it looks like,</p>
<p>I think that final scene of Mad Men is shot at Esalen.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very beautiful place.</p>
<p>And yet, mind-body to me is a neurobiological construct</p>
<p>because the nervous system extends</p>
<p>out of the cranial vault and into the spinal cord</p>
<p>and body and back and forth.</p>
<p>Okay, how should we think about the body</p>
<p>in terms of states?</p>
<p>And at some point, I&rsquo;d love for you to comment</p>
<p>on that heat map experiment,</p>
<p>because it does seem that there&rsquo;s some regularity</p>
<p>as to where people experience emotions.</p>
<p>When people are in a rage, for instance,</p>
<p>they seem to feel it both in their gut and in their head,</p>
<p>it seems, on average.</p>
<p>And people love to extrapolate to gut intuition</p>
<p>or that the chakras or anger is in the stomach,</p>
<p>and this goes to Eastern medicine, et cetera.</p>
<p>How should we think about mind-body in the context of states</p>
<p>and think about it as scientists,</p>
<p>maybe even as neuroscientists or geneticists?</p>
<p>Good.</p>
<p>So for the answer to the first question about the heat maps</p>
<p>and people associating certain parts of their body</p>
<p>with certain emotional feelings,</p>
<p>this goes back to something called</p>
<p>the somatic marker hypothesis</p>
<p>that was proposed by Antonio Damasio,</p>
<p>who is a neurologist at USC.</p>
<p>The idea that our subjective feeling</p>
<p>of a particular emotion is in part associated</p>
<p>with a sensation of something happening</p>
<p>in a particular part of our body,</p>
<p>the gut, the heart.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see the liver invoked very much</p>
<p>in emotional characterization.</p>
<p>But gall and the gallbladder. Yes.</p>
<p>Somebody having a lot of gall.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why I make a fist when I say that,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m guessing the gallbladder is shaped like a fist.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>And if there is a physiology underlying these heat maps,</p>
<p>it could reflect increased blood flow</p>
<p>to these different structures.</p>
<p>And that in turn reflects what you were talking about,</p>
<p>that is emotion definitely involves communication</p>
<p>between the brain and the body,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s bidirectional communication.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s mediated by the peripheral nervous system,</p>
<p>the sympathetic and the parasympathetic nervous system,</p>
<p>which control heart rate, for example,</p>
<p>blood vessel, blood pressure.</p>
<p>And those neurons receive input</p>
<p>from the hypothalamus and other blood brain regions,</p>
<p>central brain regions that control their activity.</p>
<p>And when the brain is put in a particular state,</p>
<p>it activates sympathetic and parasympathetic neurons,</p>
<p>which have effects on the heart and on blood pressure.</p>
<p>And these in turn feed back onto the brain</p>
<p>through the sensory system.</p>
<p>And a large part of this bidirectional communication</p>
<p>is also mediated through the vagus nerve,</p>
<p>which many of your listeners and viewers</p>
<p>may have heard about because it&rsquo;s become a topic</p>
<p>of intense activity now.</p>
<p>People have known for a long time.</p>
<p>So the vagus nerve is a bundle of nerve fibers</p>
<p>that comes out basically of your skull,</p>
<p>out of the central nervous system,</p>
<p>and then sends fibers in to your heart,</p>
<p>your gut, all sorts of visceral organs.</p>
<p>So when you have a,</p>
<p>and that information is both,</p>
<p>you used the words earlier in our discussion,</p>
<p>afferent and efferent.</p>
<p>So the vagal fibers sense things</p>
<p>that are happening in the body.</p>
<p>So when you&rsquo;re,</p>
<p>the reason you feel your stomach tied up in knots</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re tense is that those vagal fibers</p>
<p>are sensing the contraction of the gut muscles.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re also afferents,</p>
<p>which means that information coming out of the brain</p>
<p>can influence those peripheral organs as well.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s work from a number of labs</p>
<p>just in the last six months or so</p>
<p>where people are starting to decode the components</p>
<p>of the different fibers in the vagus nerve.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s amazing how much specificity is.</p>
<p>There are specific vagal nerves that go to the lung,</p>
<p>that control breathing responses,</p>
<p>that go to the gut,</p>
<p>that go to other organs.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like a set of color-coded lines,</p>
<p>labeled lines for those things.</p>
<p>And now how those vagal afferents play a role</p>
<p>in the playing out of emotion states</p>
<p>is a fascinating question</p>
<p>that people are just beginning to scrape the surface of.</p>
<p>But I think what&rsquo;s exciting now</p>
<p>is that people are gonna be developing tools</p>
<p>that will allow us to turn on or turn off</p>
<p>specific subsets of fibers within the vagus nerve</p>
<p>and ask how that affects particular emotional behaviors.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re absolutely right.</p>
<p>This brain-body connection is critical,</p>
<p>not just for the gut,</p>
<p>but for the heart, for the lungs,</p>
<p>for all kinds of other parts of your body.</p>
<p>And Darwin recognized that as well.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s a central feature of emotion state.</p>
<p>And I think what underlies</p>
<p>are subjective feelings of an emotion.</p>
<p>Incredible.</p>
<p>David, I have to say as a true fan of the work</p>
<p>that your lab has been doing over so many decades.</p>
<p>And first of all,</p>
<p>I was delighted when you stopped working on stem cells,</p>
<p>not because you weren&rsquo;t doing incredible work there,</p>
<p>but because I saw a talk</p>
<p>where you showed a movie of an octopus spitting out,</p>
<p>or not spitting,</p>
<p>but squirting out a bunch of ink and escaping.</p>
<p>And you said you were gonna work on</p>
<p>things of the sort that we&rsquo;re talking about today,</p>
<p>fear, aggression, mating behaviors, social behaviors.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been incredible to see the work that your lab has done.</p>
<p>And I know I speak on behalf of a tremendous number of people</p>
<p>and I say, thank you for taking time</p>
<p>out of your important schedule</p>
<p>to share with us what you&rsquo;ve learned.</p>
<p>My last question is a simple one,</p>
<p>which is, will you come back and talk to us again</p>
<p>in the future about the additional work that&rsquo;s sure to come?</p>
<p>I would be happy to do that.</p>
<p>And I really have appreciated your questions.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve all been right on the money.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve hit all of the critical,</p>
<p>important issues in this field.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ve uncovered what is known,</p>
<p>the little bit is known,</p>
<p>and how much is not known.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s important to emphasize the unknown things</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s what the next generation</p>
<p>of neuroscientists has to solve.</p>
<p>And so I hope this will help to attract</p>
<p>young people into this field</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s so important,</p>
<p>particularly for our understanding of mental illness</p>
<p>and mental health and psychiatry.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got to figure out how emotion systems</p>
<p>are controlled in a causal way</p>
<p>if we ever want to improve</p>
<p>on the psychiatric treatments that we have now.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s going to require the next generation</p>
<p>of people coming into the field.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>I second that.</p>
<p>Well, thank you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a delight.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>Really appreciate it.</p>
<p>Thank you for joining me today</p>

<p>We talk about things like caffeine,</p>
<p>when to drink caffeine relative to sleep,</p>
<p>alcohol, when and how and if anyone should ingest it</p>
<p>relative to sleep,</p>
<p>dopamine, serotonin, mental health, physical health,</p>
<p>and on and on.</p>

<p>This is especially useful, I believe,</p>
<p>for people that have missed some of the earlier episodes,</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re still working through the back catalog</p>
<p>of Huberman Lab podcast,</p>
<p>which admittedly can be rather long.</p>
<p>And last, but certainly not least,</p>
<p>thank you for your interest in science.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
