    <p>hi friends this long-awaited episode is finally here why nice guys be finishing</p>
<p>last but I really want to put emphasis on the friends when I say hi friends</p>
<p>because I want you to know that we&rsquo;re friends and I&rsquo;m only gonna tell you</p>
<p>everything in this episode because you need to fucking hear it okay but we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>friends we&rsquo;re besties bestie for the resty but I am gonna hurt your feelings</p>
<p>if you are someone that thinks they&rsquo;re a nice person and you&rsquo;re just like</p>
<p>frustrated with why nobody likes you babe I&rsquo;m about to bring you face to face</p>
<p>with what you need to hear please don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m attacking you I love you so</p>
<p>the whole nice guys finish last thing this can be for girls too so this is for</p>
<p>anybody that considers their self air quote a nice person that isn&rsquo;t picked</p>
<p>and why like nobody wants you basically the phrase is just why nice guys finish</p>
<p>last but it could be guy or girl or they or them okay whatever you like</p>
<p>make it work there&rsquo;s a lot to unpack with this but I&rsquo;m just gonna start at</p>
<p>the first thing that comes to my mind which is respect if someone does not</p>
<p>respect you they will not want to fuck you they will not want to be with you</p>
<p>they will not want to date you they will not want to talk to you get that like</p>
<p>really get that and take that in for a second because that&rsquo;s something a lot of</p>
<p>people don&rsquo;t really talk about nowadays is respect anymore and I&rsquo;m not saying</p>
<p>like oh you need to show me respect it&rsquo;s like no you need to be respectable so no</p>
<p>one is gonna watch you if you&rsquo;re not respectable so let&rsquo;s unpack that real</p>
<p>quick because a lot of people are running around nowadays like toddlers and</p>
<p>want people to like them like people don&rsquo;t not like you because you&rsquo;re nice</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s because of other things I should have started with that I should have</p>
<p>started the whole fucking episode with that people don&rsquo;t not like you is that</p>
<p>the right thing people don&rsquo;t not yeah that&rsquo;s right people don&rsquo;t not like you</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re nice so throw that out the fucking window you got other shit</p>
<p>wrong with you really you just got other shit going on there&rsquo;s other qualities</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t like it&rsquo;s not the fact that you&rsquo;re nice I&rsquo;m gonna use myself as an</p>
<p>example so when I look for a partner I don&rsquo;t I&rsquo;m gonna be single for the rest</p>
<p>of my life I hate all people but if I was gonna look for someone I want</p>
<p>someone that has their own thoughts their own opinions their own life their</p>
<p>own personality their own shit to do I don&rsquo;t want someone that is just gonna</p>
<p>completely mold to me and agree with everything that I say and want to do all</p>
<p>the shit that I do and be waiting around all day for me to hang out with</p>
<p>them and me to talk to them like you need to be busy doing your own shit so</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s unpack the respect thing really fast a big thing that the nice guys do</p>
<p>is they allow people to disrespect them and I&rsquo;m talking in little tiny ways like</p>
<p>when someone says something you don&rsquo;t like and you just let it go they just</p>
<p>big dick to you so it&rsquo;s like if I&rsquo;m straight and I like a girl and I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>trying to like pursue her if she says something that I don&rsquo;t like or she</p>
<p>talks about fucking another dude or liking another dude or another dude</p>
<p>being cute in front of me and I just pretend I didn&rsquo;t hear it or I pretend it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t bother me she just big dick to me she just took the upper hand for me</p>
<p>someone like me is gonna say I don&rsquo;t want to hear about nobody being cute but</p>
<p>me okay like you got to call people out on their fucking shit like if someone is</p>
<p>interested in you and you&rsquo;re interested in them and they talk about somebody</p>
<p>else that ain&rsquo;t gonna fly you need to draw that line very quickly but that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna make the other person respect you when you make people fucking behave</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna respect you they&rsquo;re gonna like that people are gonna test you</p>
<p>people are gonna push you people are gonna see what they can get away with</p>
<p>and what kind of person you are they need to see if you&rsquo;re someone that they</p>
<p>can walk all over or not and a lot of people will test you subconsciously so</p>
<p>if a girl talks about another boy being cute excuse me motherfucker</p>
<p>oh you&rsquo;re talking about me yeah that&rsquo;s what I thought like check them don&rsquo;t let</p>
<p>no shit slide and as soon as you start letting shit slide boom you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>unfuckable you&rsquo;re not respectable like that&rsquo;s fucking gross that&rsquo;s a turnoff</p>
<p>that will dry a girl&rsquo;s pussy up sorry that&rsquo;s the truth so kind of like how I</p>
<p>just threw that into the conversation like you set the boundary but you do it</p>
<p>in a funny way like you&rsquo;re not supposed to be a fucking asshole every time and</p>
<p>like prove your point and set your boundaries and draw these lines in a</p>
<p>mean way you need to do it and like I&rsquo;ve read like a like a respectable way where</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like my point got across but I&rsquo;m not ruining the entire situation like if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re out somewhere having fun you got to draw a line without ruining the mood</p>
<p>of the night like you can do it funny how I just gave the example like who the</p>
<p>fuck you talking about being cute besides me you know what I mean like</p>
<p>make it a joke but make it very clear that you don&rsquo;t want to hear about that</p>
<p>shit anything that can be taken like disrespectfully to you don&rsquo;t let it fly</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t let it slide that is rule number fucking one for a nice guy is speak the</p>
<p>fuck up don&rsquo;t let nobody walk all over you because like I said you&rsquo;re instantly</p>
<p>unfuckable you&rsquo;re gonna be a pity fuck you&rsquo;re gonna be someone that I call late</p>
<p>at night when I&rsquo;m drunk and I&rsquo;m like oh I know they&rsquo;re easy they&rsquo;re there they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>accessible I&rsquo;ll call them and fuck them you&rsquo;re a pity fuck you&rsquo;re like a last</p>
<p>option you&rsquo;re something like and you&rsquo;re there like I guess I&rsquo;ll throw you a bone</p>
<p>like I have no other option you know that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re gonna turn into if</p>
<p>you let someone walk all over you you don&rsquo;t want to be that if you listen to</p>
<p>this podcast you are not gonna fucking be that you&rsquo;re not gonna be one of my</p>
<p>followers and one of my listeners and one of my friends because whoever</p>
<p>listens to this podcast is my fucking friend like I start every episode hi</p>
<p>friends you&rsquo;re not gonna be my friend and be behaving like this okay so take</p>
<p>your fucking notes from this podcast so the second part kind of to when I said</p>
<p>speak up like if you&rsquo;re a nice guy you need to speak up you need to let people</p>
<p>know you have your own thoughts and opinions if you&rsquo;re interested in someone</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;re supposed to bring forth your personality it takes two people to be in</p>
<p>a relationship it takes two people to like push and pull and lead and follow</p>
<p>like you need to be able to flow with that easily it&rsquo;s not just all about them</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not the only one with thoughts and shit to do and opinions and plans</p>
<p>and decisions to make like you make decisions too you have a personality too</p>
<p>you have a life too you have opinions too and people need that people want</p>
<p>that people don&rsquo;t want someone that&rsquo;s just like a fucking lump on a log that</p>
<p>has nothing to say so the speak up part is speak up literally like if you like</p>
<p>something express that you like it if you have hobbies talk about them if you</p>
<p>have shit to do talk about it if you want to do certain things then make</p>
<p>those decisions and invite the person you&rsquo;re interested in like incorporate</p>
<p>that person into your life make them feel like you already have a life and</p>
<p>you want them to be a part of it not that you need them to be a part of it</p>
<p>not that you&rsquo;re sitting around waiting for them to make you a part of their</p>
<p>life that&rsquo;ll turn a motherfucker off in two seconds and don&rsquo;t just agree with</p>
<p>what someone says like don&rsquo;t always just agree and be a yes man like be open and</p>
<p>be honest when I talked about expressing the way you feel in the</p>
<p>podcast episode expressing how you feel you need to do that but also with other</p>
<p>shit so like you need to express the positive and the good things and also</p>
<p>the bad things because it makes someone feel safe with you if someone only ever</p>
<p>hears positive shit coming out of your mouth because you&rsquo;re air quote the nice</p>
<p>guy if you&rsquo;re always just trying to be nice and not hurt their feelings they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not gonna trust you they&rsquo;re not gonna feel safe around you and whenever you do</p>
<p>say something positive they&rsquo;re gonna believe it because if someone just tells</p>
<p>you you&rsquo;re pretty you&rsquo;re pretty you&rsquo;re pretty you&rsquo;re pretty you&rsquo;re gonna stop</p>
<p>believing them when they say it their words are gonna hold no weight but if</p>
<p>you walk out for like if you see them four days in a row and they&rsquo;re like okay</p>
<p>you look pretty you look pretty I don&rsquo;t like this outfit and then the next day</p>
<p>you look pretty they&rsquo;ll learn to trust what you&rsquo;re saying because they know</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll be honest because I don&rsquo;t trust the motherfucker that&rsquo;s just a yes man I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t want you to spare my feelings I want you to be considerate of my feelings</p>
<p>but I want you to tell me what I need to hear if I look like shit tell me you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t like that outfit tell me I can do better tell me something constructive</p>
<p>not critical so that I trust when you give me praise when you tell me I look</p>
<p>good I&rsquo;ll believe it and kind of bouncing back really quick to the</p>
<p>disrespect thing I didn&rsquo;t talk about this but if someone is like testing you</p>
<p>and they say something that they know like they wouldn&rsquo;t be cool with like if</p>
<p>they talk about someone else being cute and they know that you like them if you</p>
<p>just let that slide in the back of their mind they&rsquo;re gonna make a note of that</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re gonna be like okay I just said this and they just let it go</p>
<p>like I know it was hurtful I know that would have hurt their feelings and like</p>
<p>you just hiding it immediately makes you untrustworthy because the person</p>
<p>that said it is like this should have hurt their feelings and they&rsquo;re acting</p>
<p>like it didn&rsquo;t so either it didn&rsquo;t hurt their feelings so they don&rsquo;t like me or</p>
<p>it hurt their feelings but they&rsquo;re hiding it and hiding your feelings makes</p>
<p>people not trust you it&rsquo;s like you take your arm out and you want to like push</p>
<p>them away because they&rsquo;re an unknown now they&rsquo;re a mystery they&rsquo;re scary they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>like a ticking time bomb because you just did something to hurt them and</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not letting you know and it&rsquo;s like oh fuck you&rsquo;re like anticipating</p>
<p>their response and when they don&rsquo;t have one you&rsquo;re like oh fuck and they just</p>
<p>saw that you just swallowed the way that you felt even though like you would have</p>
<p>gotten out about something but you just pretended you didn&rsquo;t get mad so</p>
<p>typically with those people they&rsquo;ll let things bother them and it will build up</p>
<p>until they explode so like the nice guys are usually only air quote nice guys</p>
<p>until you piss them off or until you step on them one too many times because</p>
<p>they hide the way that they feel they pretend like they&rsquo;re not bothered by it</p>
<p>but if you say it four or five times like mentioning another guy on the fifth</p>
<p>time they&rsquo;re gonna pop and cuss you the fuck out but like I said in the other</p>
<p>episode you have to express the way that you feel or you&rsquo;re a fucking asshole</p>
<p>when you explode but the nice guys do that so straight girls already have this</p>
<p>idea of like this guy&rsquo;s only being nice to me because he thinks he has a chance</p>
<p>to fuck me but as soon as I turn him down he&rsquo;s gonna call me a whore or he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna call me ugly like they&rsquo;re anticipating a negative response already</p>
<p>so they&rsquo;re already standoffish but I&rsquo;m talking about that dynamic and most of</p>
<p>the times if someone assumes you just want to fuck them they&rsquo;re gonna be</p>
<p>hesitant to even engage with you because they know what your motive is and they</p>
<p>know how people are like blowing smoke up your ass nice to you one minute and</p>
<p>then as soon as you reject them they attack you because they can&rsquo;t have you</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s just so much going on in the brain and I told you guys there&rsquo;s a lot</p>
<p>to unpack with this but I&rsquo;m trying to make it make sense but when you just let</p>
<p>something go that it&rsquo;s obvious that should have hurt your feelings if it did</p>
<p>hurt your feelings and you don&rsquo;t speak about it you&rsquo;re immediately like pushed</p>
<p>away because they don&rsquo;t trust you now like why the fuck did you not speak up</p>
<p>what are you planning what are you doing why are you bottling it up what&rsquo;s about</p>
<p>to happen you know and then someone will probably subconsciously like keep</p>
<p>testing you to see if you will pop they want to see like when are you gonna</p>
<p>speak up what is your breaking point where you can only hold in so much</p>
<p>because people that hold shit in I don&rsquo;t like to be around them I want you to be</p>
<p>honest with me and tell me what&rsquo;s going on because I don&rsquo;t want to have to deal</p>
<p>with walking in the door one day and all of a sudden you just pop and freak the</p>
<p>fuck out because something set you off because you&rsquo;ve been holding in certain</p>
<p>things I&rsquo;ve done and said for the past few months you know like the anticipation</p>
<p>of a negative reaction will make someone want to push you away so if they think</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna get that they&rsquo;re gonna push you away and that&rsquo;s what allowing</p>
<p>someone to disrespect you will do it will make the other person scared okay</p>
<p>so the next layer of this that kind of stacks is you need someone that cares</p>
<p>about how they feel and typically nice guys don&rsquo;t care about the way that they</p>
<p>feel they care about everybody else&rsquo;s feelings and they want to make sure</p>
<p>everybody else is happy they want to make sure they don&rsquo;t hurt anybody like</p>
<p>nice guys I see you I see your intentions are good I was a nice guy one</p>
<p>time I had to learn all this in sixth grade this girl fucking like broke my</p>
<p>heart and I&rsquo;ve been yelling fuck these bitches ever since and then I gained</p>
<p>some self-awareness and now here I am but I get it I you have like pure</p>
<p>intentions you just want them to like you you probably had a childhood where</p>
<p>you were taught to disregard the way you felt so that your parents loved you and</p>
<p>accepted you and you had to prioritize the way that they felt over you I get it</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m telling you now the reason this is off-putting so when you have a</p>
<p>partner or someone you&rsquo;re interested in you need to care about the way that you</p>
<p>feel because if you don&rsquo;t care how you feel then you&rsquo;re gonna make me</p>
<p>responsible for it and that puts me in a position to have to like care take you</p>
<p>like a fucking baby I also need you to care about what you have going on I need</p>
<p>you to care about your hobbies and your life and the shit that you like and what</p>
<p>you have like your own life is important and I want you to care about that I want</p>
<p>you to prioritize your goals your boundaries your feelings I need you to</p>
<p>care about yourself in order for me to feel safe to care about you if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>willing to just throw away everything of yours to make sure that I&rsquo;m happy</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna resent me for it you&rsquo;re gonna make me responsible for the way</p>
<p>that you feel and I&rsquo;m gonna have to like consider you way too much if you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>considering yourself like you can&rsquo;t just throw all that on to me if you&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>date me so let me give you a couple examples let&rsquo;s say you have this thing</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re working on and you&rsquo;re supposed to go work on it at a certain</p>
<p>time and me and you want to hang out with me and like I message you or</p>
<p>whatever the fuck like we&rsquo;re supposed to hang out but you have something that you</p>
<p>want to do if you just throw it away and then come hang out with me that&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>hot I need someone to prioritize what they want so I would rather someone say</p>
<p>look I really want to see you but I want to get this done or I already</p>
<p>committed to plans or I have this thing to do like I need to be working on this</p>
<p>but I really want to see you let&rsquo;s reschedule I want you to reject me and</p>
<p>not always be available that&rsquo;s a whole other topic but it&rsquo;s a good example I</p>
<p>want you to not always be available I want you to reject me while also</p>
<p>reassuring me that you like me because if you&rsquo;re just like no I have to go do</p>
<p>this I&rsquo;m gonna think you don&rsquo;t like me but if you say it how I said it like</p>
<p>look I want to see you but I have this thing I need to go do or this thing I</p>
<p>want to I&rsquo;m really excited to work about on this thing can we hang out another</p>
<p>day well something like that reassure me you motherfucking like me all right you</p>
<p>always need to reassure me you like me okay Leo it&rsquo;s not about you like I want</p>
<p>you to fucking wake up reassure me every breath you take reassure me I mother</p>
<p>but Leo I like you I like you I like you I still like you I still like you I</p>
<p>still care about you like I need it non-stop but we ain&rsquo;t gonna talk about</p>
<p>me we that&rsquo;s I&rsquo;m a special case like don&rsquo;t even try to unlock my file bitch</p>
<p>like you cannot I&rsquo;m unworkable like I said in the beginning of this I will be</p>
<p>single for the rest of my life I&rsquo;m undateable like I have too much it</p>
<p>makes me sad it really does like I&rsquo;m not gonna open up no we&rsquo;re not gonna do that</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not gonna get vulnerable Leo&rsquo;s not gonna date ever again okay he&rsquo;s too</p>
<p>fucked up in his own little way and no back to you if you have something that</p>
<p>you really want to work on but you&rsquo;re like the nice guy and you&rsquo;re like you</p>
<p>have an internal conflict of like I really want to go work on this thing but</p>
<p>I really want to go see this person they&rsquo;re finally giving me a chance to go</p>
<p>see them you need to prioritize yourself it&rsquo;s gonna be so hot to the other person</p>
<p>I promise I promise but if this person knows that you really want to work on</p>
<p>this thing and they know that you skipped doing that to go hang out with</p>
<p>them they&rsquo;re gonna be like oh fuck you know because they want to feel</p>
<p>comfortable like you&rsquo;re gonna prioritize your own happiness and what you want to</p>
<p>do because they don&rsquo;t want to have to do it so it&rsquo;s like if I invite you hey</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s hang out and you have the thing that I know you want to work on if I</p>
<p>know you actually want to work on it you&rsquo;ll tell me look Leo I want to hang</p>
<p>out but I really just want to work on this but if you don&rsquo;t do that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>like oh I&rsquo;ll work on it later and I&rsquo;ll just come see you like if you&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>come see me I&rsquo;ll like it the first time and then after it happens a couple times</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be like wait like you&rsquo;re neglecting doing the thing that you want to do to</p>
<p>come see me I&rsquo;m instantly gonna like push you away like the push away thing</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna stick my fucking arm out I don&rsquo;t like that I need some I need to</p>
<p>know that you&rsquo;re prioritizing yourself your happiness and what you want to do</p>
<p>because that puts me in the position of like okay I know you want to go work on</p>
<p>this thing I asked you to come hang out with me but now I have to be hyper</p>
<p>considerate and be like no I&rsquo;m not gonna invite you or I&rsquo;m gonna tell you to go</p>
<p>do that thing and I&rsquo;m just gonna stop inviting you to shit to hang out with me</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t want you to sacrifice what you&rsquo;re doing to come see me you</p>
<p>know I want to make sure that you&rsquo;re taking care of yourself so I don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>to take care of you does that make sense I really really hope this is clicking</p>
<p>because it makes sense in my brain a lot of things do but when I speak them</p>
<p>they just don&rsquo;t fucking work but the same thing with feelings it goes the</p>
<p>exact same way if I keep doing something that bothers you I want you to fucking</p>
<p>tell me I want you to nicely acknowledge it bring it up not everything has to be</p>
<p>a fight you can have altercation confrontation you can have conflict and</p>
<p>not have it be aggressive and mean and attacking each other you can have a</p>
<p>fucking conversation it takes a certain person to be able to do that it takes a</p>
<p>certain level of maturity to do that but it&rsquo;s possible the way you feel is not</p>
<p>annoying the way you feel is not gonna cause a fight I promise like with the</p>
<p>right people and people that are understanding and people that get it the</p>
<p>way you feel will never be a fight and that is not gonna make you on attractive</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not gonna make someone not want you you having feelings or being upset by</p>
<p>something is not gonna make someone not want to be with you or like you anymore</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not unattractive when you find the right fucking person but I cannot</p>
<p>emphasize enough how important it is for you to prioritize and care about your</p>
<p>own feelings care about the way that you motherfucking feel and make people</p>
<p>around you feel comfortable that if you are uncomfortable you&rsquo;re gonna speak up</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re gonna do something to change it because I&rsquo;m gonna feel like an</p>
<p>asshole if you&rsquo;re uncomfortable and I don&rsquo;t know and then I find out you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>uncomfortable and I&rsquo;m like oh my god like I would have done so many things</p>
<p>different like I said in the expressing your feelings episode you need to</p>
<p>express the way you fucking feel to give me the chance to accommodate you but I</p>
<p>also need to be able to trust you that you&rsquo;re not just gonna suffer for me I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t want you to be uncomfortable and just suck that up just to be around me</p>
<p>or be near me or be with me I want you to speak up because I don&rsquo;t want you to</p>
<p>suffer and I don&rsquo;t want you to suffer for me because I&rsquo;m gonna feel guilt no</p>
<p>matter what you do like if I find out that you were just suffering for me I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna fucking feel bad that&rsquo;s how I am and that&rsquo;s how a lot of people are</p>
<p>receiving you if you&rsquo;re a nice guy that is doing this shit I don&rsquo;t want you to</p>
<p>be upset I don&rsquo;t want you to be uncomfortable I need to trust that you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t want yourself to be uncomfortable either that you will speak up and that</p>
<p>you care about how you feel and that you&rsquo;ll make a situation better for</p>
<p>yourself with me you know what I mean like we can work through this we can</p>
<p>work on it but I need to trust that you can own yourself that you can take care</p>
<p>of yourself because if you can&rsquo;t do that how the fuck are you gonna be able to</p>
<p>take me into consideration you&rsquo;re not even taking yourself into consideration</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a huge red flag but people don&rsquo;t know how to break that down in their</p>
<p>brain how I just put it into words people just feel all these things and</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t understand why they&rsquo;re pushing you away but they are and that&rsquo;s it that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>fucking it so someone might not be able to communicate to you why they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>like you you just make them feel all these things and pressure oh my god like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the way it&rsquo;s the nastiest sucking feeling it and I&rsquo;m like if you could see</p>
<p>my body right now I look like a fucking flamingo like one leg is up my hands are</p>
<p>perched out like chicken hands like I&rsquo;m like you like get back up uh-uh</p>
<p>Mitch I was really just standing like a fucking flamingo one foot so you being</p>
<p>able to care take yourself in this way and prioritize your feelings your</p>
<p>happiness and trusting that you will take care of yourself and like not make</p>
<p>yourself suffer for me that&rsquo;s huge because imagine you don&rsquo;t do that the</p>
<p>pressure it&rsquo;s gonna put on me to have to take care of you like I said like a</p>
<p>toddler I&rsquo;m gonna feel like I now have to consider myself my own life and then</p>
<p>take care of you that&rsquo;s why so many women wear the pants in relationships</p>
<p>with men because men don&rsquo;t know how to fucking do this like if a girl wanted me</p>
<p>all she would want is for me to be so strong in my sense of self and</p>
<p>prioritize myself so much so that she could choose to do it if she wanted to</p>
<p>she could choose to add on to it she could choose to do things to help me and</p>
<p>make me feel better but she doesn&rsquo;t feel like she has to it&rsquo;s not like she has to</p>
<p>look out for me and her like she wants someone that will like own their self</p>
<p>and stand next to her that&rsquo;s it and that&rsquo;s really for anyone in a</p>
<p>relationship that&rsquo;s gonna be a healthy relationship I&rsquo;m talking for healthy</p>
<p>shit if you don&rsquo;t do any of this that&rsquo;s talk not toxic but you&rsquo;re slippery slope</p>
<p>bitch slippery slope and the people that don&rsquo;t want this it&rsquo;s not a healthy</p>
<p>relationship in my opinion I&rsquo;m not a fucking psychologist but I goddamn</p>
<p>should be I just don&rsquo;t want to go to school I just have to throw in in my</p>
<p>opinion on something so everybody gets off my dick and doesn&rsquo;t try to attack me</p>
<p>cuz y&rsquo;all motherfuckers are so opinionated just like me but y&rsquo;all be</p>
<p>wrong oh fuck okay someone messaged me about my laughs in my podcast and y&rsquo;all</p>
<p>I pissed myself laughing all the time and I edit it out like I edit out my</p>
<p>laughing because I&rsquo;m like no one wants to hear that like shut up and just get</p>
<p>to the point but this girl was like oh my god I love it when you laugh and she</p>
<p>said please don&rsquo;t edit out your laughs so like I&rsquo;ve been leaving them in this</p>
<p>episode girl I fucking die I piss myself recording this podcast it is so much fun</p>
<p>for me but tell me if you think I should leave the laughs in or cut them out</p>
<p>cuz they make me nervous so another little point I have to go along with the</p>
<p>whole have your own life thing and prioritize yourself and your own feelings</p>
<p>and shit what&rsquo;s attractive to me is seeing someone with their own life and</p>
<p>their own shit like I like somebody that&rsquo;s busy but for them to add me into</p>
<p>it to prioritize seeing me and hanging out with me because that reassures me</p>
<p>that they care yes they&rsquo;re busy yes they&rsquo;re gonna make sure that they get</p>
<p>what they want but they are gonna find a way to add me into that and add me into</p>
<p>their life that is so fucking hot that will have a girl&rsquo;s pussy fucking soaked</p>
<p>and that has my dick hard when someone does that oh my god it will make someone</p>
<p>insecure like it makes me insecure cuz I need the constant I&rsquo;m not the type to</p>
<p>have a healthy relationship but I&rsquo;m the type to teach about it coaches don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>play bitch alright I could teach you everything you need to know about having</p>
<p>a healthy relationship but am I ever gonna be in one no I don&rsquo;t operate like</p>
<p>but someone to add like to add me into their life that&rsquo;s so fucking hot but I</p>
<p>would need constant reassurance but like I said it ain&rsquo;t about me this applies to</p>
<p>everybody like you will become an object of desire if you have your own shit</p>
<p>going on like if someone can walk up to you and walk away from you and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna be the same regardless and still have your own shit going on that is so</p>
<p>fucking hot when you&rsquo;re not needed when you are wanted that is so safe for</p>
<p>people and there&rsquo;s this thing called enmeshment trauma and I really want you</p>
<p>to look it up if you consider yourself a nice guy it&rsquo;s gonna teach you a lot</p>
<p>about the way that you are and there&rsquo;s gonna be some things that you can</p>
<p>probably look up to like work through it and some of those tendencies and you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>learn some behaviors you adopted as a kid to keep yourself safe that are now</p>
<p>biting you in the fucking ass that I have mentioned in this podcast so like I</p>
<p>said being prioritized and being wanted makes someone feel safe if someone feels</p>
<p>needed it&rsquo;s gonna make them anxious as fuck like literally if I think that you</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t function without me and that your life is gonna like deteriorate if I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>not in it and I&rsquo;m not like tending to you and I&rsquo;m not with you I don&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t fucking like that at all so that&rsquo;s another reason I&rsquo;ll push a</p>
<p>fucking nice guy away get the fuck from me I don&rsquo;t want no fucking text if I</p>
<p>want to leave you up I&rsquo;m gonna do myself shut the fuck up do not I need to calm</p>
<p>down because this is a very sensitive topic but do not ever fucking send</p>
<p>nobody that text friend if you&rsquo;re listening to this podcast you&rsquo;re my</p>
<p>friend and friends don&rsquo;t let friends look stupid don&rsquo;t you ever fucking text</p>
<p>somebody if you leave me I&rsquo;m gonna kill myself let them fucking leave you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>fucking going nowhere call me bitch you ain&rsquo;t killing yourself over</p>
<p>no fucking body and you are not dropping your ego like that to tell</p>
<p>somebody if you fucking leave me or you break up with me I&rsquo;m gonna kill myself</p>
<p>no that is you like getting on your fucking knees and like taking away any</p>
<p>any sense of self any ego you have like I&rsquo;m a tight friend that will snatch you</p>
<p>the fuck up and make you stand up like you&rsquo;re not gonna do that you&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>have dignity you&rsquo;re gonna walk the motherfuck away and you&rsquo;re gonna be just</p>
<p>fine whoo that makes me so fucking bad I understand that feeling personally you</p>
<p>have me to relate to but in your fucking moment of high emotional</p>
<p>feelings of whatever it is do not ever fucking do that ever don&rsquo;t ever send</p>
<p>nobody a video you crying either I called that out on the red flags but</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t you dare don&rsquo;t you have some ego have some fucking dignity all right</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t you ever fucking belittle yourself like that to make someone like no no</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s other ways to manipulate and I will teach you them there&rsquo;s other ways</p>
<p>to hurt people I will teach you them oh I just had some water I had a fucking</p>
<p>breather I need to go have a cigarette because that one just made me mad okay</p>
<p>but my point with the whole feel wanted and prioritized not needed that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>pressure that people will avoid like hell and people with enmeshment trauma</p>
<p>so I talked about that that&rsquo;s gonna be the nice guys but nice guys that&rsquo;s also</p>
<p>gonna push you away like nice guys you&rsquo;re chasing people that don&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>you because that feels safe there&rsquo;s someone that doesn&rsquo;t need you but if it</p>
<p>flipped and they all of a sudden needed you you would run the fuck away you</p>
<p>would think it was fun in the moment you&rsquo;d be like oh my god I finally got</p>
<p>what I wanted yay and then you would run like hell because you&rsquo;ve already had the</p>
<p>enmeshment trauma it&rsquo;s gonna trigger your fucking shit that you didn&rsquo;t deal</p>
<p>with and girl I&rsquo;m telling you you&rsquo;re gonna freak out you&rsquo;re gonna freak the</p>
<p>fuck out like it&rsquo;s all fun and games when you&rsquo;re chasing them but as soon as</p>
<p>they start chasing you you&rsquo;re over it you&rsquo;re done because they&rsquo;re about to</p>
<p>lose their self in you and that&rsquo;s what enmeshment trauma is it&rsquo;s like you lose</p>
<p>yourself in the other person and no that&rsquo;s a little piece of awareness for</p>
<p>you guys to learn about yourself the nice guys is you think you want it but</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just as repelled by it as you&rsquo;re enticed by it it&rsquo;s a hard thing to</p>
<p>explain so please look it up like please just look it up and it will all make</p>
<p>more sense because someone with enmeshment trauma does not want to be</p>
<p>needed I&rsquo;m someone that I do not want someone that needs me I do not want</p>
<p>someone that can&rsquo;t function without me I don&rsquo;t want to be responsible for the way</p>
<p>that someone feels and making sure that they&rsquo;re doing what they like I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>want you sacrificing shit for me the sacrifice is not love sacrifice is not</p>
<p>showing that you care prioritizing the way that you motherfucking feel is how</p>
<p>you show somebody you care because you&rsquo;re providing a sense of safety to</p>
<p>them safety to be with you safety to be around you and safety to love you it</p>
<p>sounds so backwards I know we&rsquo;re all taught so backwards from that but the</p>
<p>most loving thing you can do for others is love yourself and I&rsquo;ll do a whole</p>
<p>podcast on self-love cuz y&rsquo;all are not ready for that oh my god like though the</p>
<p>internet might burn down I&rsquo;m dead ass like the shit that I have to fucking say</p>
<p>about self-love y&rsquo;all are not gonna know what to do maybe I write a book bitch</p>
<p>please hey right no goddamn book this podcast is my book I&rsquo;m too like vocal to</p>
<p>be writing a damn book I&rsquo;d much rather talk it out and fucking giggle and</p>
<p>chuckle with you guys I say you guys like you&rsquo;re here bitch I feel like I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>hanging out with my friend every time I record this podcast I feel like we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>just like hanging out oh I do want to go back and touch on the whole being</p>
<p>available thing if you just have your own shit going on you&rsquo;re gonna be less</p>
<p>available like you&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re gonna feel prioritized so anytime that someone wants</p>
<p>to hang out with you that you&rsquo;re interested in let them know that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not just sitting around waiting for them like make some shit up bitch even</p>
<p>if you have to make it up just make it up don&rsquo;t make it seem like you&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>sitting on your ass waiting for them to text you or ask you to hang out like no</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t do that okay so moral of a story is people do not like assholes people</p>
<p>are not attracted to assholes like I said in the beginning people don&rsquo;t not</p>
<p>like you cuz you&rsquo;re nice people don&rsquo;t like assholes but I&rsquo;d rather have</p>
<p>someone that&rsquo;s an asshole than someone that is an air quote nice guy because I</p>
<p>feel safer with an asshole because the asshole is gonna speak the fuck up like</p>
<p>yeah they might be a little bit mean yeah they might be dismissive but I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have to deal with the guilt of them not being taken care of because an</p>
<p>asshole is gonna make sure that they&rsquo;re good so I&rsquo;d rather be getting cussed the</p>
<p>fuck out and all I have to worry about is myself then deal with trying to baby</p>
<p>somebody and make sure that they&rsquo;re taken care of and myself you know what I</p>
<p>mean there&rsquo;s so much more to that but no one likes anyone passive that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>another thing don&rsquo;t be fucking passive don&rsquo;t do not be walked over like don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>oh my god I don&rsquo;t I even know how to explain it like if you get it you get it</p>
<p>if you fucking get it you get it if you don&rsquo;t get it good luck</p>
<p>oh another good point I just thought of the spotlight does not always need to be</p>
<p>on them it&rsquo;s not always about them it&rsquo;s not all about them and making them happy</p>
<p>and making them a center of attention like people do not like to be the center</p>
<p>of attention for too long you need it passed back and forth if you leave</p>
<p>sunlight on something too long it will burn it you need to have periods where</p>
<p>it comes off so the spotlight basically needs to like rotate back and forth</p>
<p>between you two it needs to be about me that needs to be about you it doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>need to just always be about you that gets boring that gets fucking boring and</p>
<p>people don&rsquo;t like that pressure like if it&rsquo;s always if the ball is always in my</p>
<p>court god damn I&rsquo;m annoyed uh I don&rsquo;t want to fucking be having to start every</p>
<p>single game bitch like you do something push and pull give and get like you do</p>
<p>some pick up some slack ho don&rsquo;t always be looking at me to entertain you and to</p>
<p>carry the conversations and to decide where we&rsquo;re gonna go eat and decide what</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna do and decide when we&rsquo;re gonna hang out like motherfucker take</p>
<p>some control take some goddamn initiative take some goddamn control</p>
<p>okay get the spotlight off me it&rsquo;s burning me but people don&rsquo;t enjoy that</p>
<p>people don&rsquo;t enjoy constant attention trust me they might seem like they do</p>
<p>but nobody enjoys it constantly even celebrities that have the fucking</p>
<p>spotlight on them all the time it gets exhausting they&rsquo;re tired of it they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>sick of it nobody wants that pressure because having the attention be on you</p>
<p>is pressure another pointer is do not act like they are blessing you every</p>
<p>time they want to see you talk to you or hang out with you like you&rsquo;re sitting</p>
<p>around waiting for their texts no I&rsquo;m someone&rsquo;s worthy of texting to you think</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna be sitting around waiting for someone to text me yeah if I like you</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re also getting the chance to talk to a really cool motherfucker too</p>
<p>so if I&rsquo;m texting you you&rsquo;re excited about texting me and that&rsquo;s something I</p>
<p>forget a lot or I used to and I&rsquo;ve had to kind of grow into that is to realize</p>
<p>this person is getting a chance to be with someone cool too it&rsquo;s not just</p>
<p>about them they&rsquo;re not the only one with value to contribute and like shit to</p>
<p>offer I am too you have to see what they&rsquo;re getting out of you also and</p>
<p>realize and reassure yourself that it&rsquo;s fucking good like if they like you yeah</p>
<p>why would they not don&rsquo;t be cocky but acknowledge and see where you add value</p>
<p>and what value you do have honestly I don&rsquo;t even need to say it don&rsquo;t be</p>
<p>cocky because nice guys are not cocky they&rsquo;re the most insecure bunch so for</p>
<p>me to try and kick it up and like tell you to tell yourself why would they not</p>
<p>like me that&rsquo;s gonna blow your head up just to the right amount okay so you</p>
<p>need that like why would they not want to text me why would they not want to</p>
<p>hang out with me don&rsquo;t act shocked oh my god like oh my god they wanna hang out</p>
<p>no bitch yeah yay cool let&rsquo;s hang out I&rsquo;m excited to see you but don&rsquo;t act</p>
<p>like they&rsquo;re like blessing you and they&rsquo;re a God&rsquo;s little gift to earth</p>
<p>like and if you are gonna act like that do in your own fucking head okay don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>let them know that don&rsquo;t let them know that you&rsquo;re like oh my god like you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>what is it called like a pigeon like you&rsquo;re a pigeon like waiting for them to</p>
<p>throw you some breadcrumbs like oh my god no you&rsquo;re not gonna behave like that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not gonna be like that do not set up that dynamic because once you feed a</p>
<p>pigeon the pigeon can never flip around and be the one feeding me like once a</p>
<p>pigeon always a pigeon like you&rsquo;re the one being fed you want to be the one</p>
<p>that feeds okay that&rsquo;s how this goes but like once you&rsquo;re in the role of the</p>
<p>pigeon you can&rsquo;t flip it so like once they get the upper hand you&rsquo;re fucked so</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t be a pigeon I don&rsquo;t know where this analogy just came from but it works</p>
<p>oh when you&rsquo;re texting them don&rsquo;t always just let them leave you on read like</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t feel like you need to keep shit going leave them on read I don&rsquo;t have my</p>
<p>seats on that&rsquo;s petty but like don&rsquo;t be the one to always be like the last word</p>
<p>let them sometimes be the last one to talk or the last one to say some shit</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t need to always like every time like don&rsquo;t be the fucking pigeon like</p>
<p>every time you&rsquo;re there they might throw you a like a piece of bread you&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re like standing there ready to get it like no don&rsquo;t fucking get up and get</p>
<p>ready to get it like don&rsquo;t don&rsquo;t fucking do that if you don&rsquo;t want to get the</p>
<p>breadcrumb like just fucking look at them but okay like if you throw it man</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll see if I feel like getting it don&rsquo;t always be the one like responding to</p>
<p>their shit like you&rsquo;re so excited to talk to them and I get it and listen to</p>
<p>episode 2 of this fucking podcast okay but when you&rsquo;re the one that&rsquo;s like oh</p>
<p>my god I&rsquo;m so glad that they text me I want to keep talking you have to know</p>
<p>when to cut the conversation because if you just keep going for nonsense like</p>
<p>bullshit they&rsquo;re gonna like they might just be responding to be nice but like</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t let them pity text you like if the conversation is not holding anything of</p>
<p>substance let it die don&rsquo;t respond you know if you have something fucking</p>
<p>important to say later text them again but if something is just like stupid and</p>
<p>meaningless if you&rsquo;re not really interested in it let it die I know that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re like idolizing them and you&rsquo;re excited about them and you like them but</p>
<p>picture having this conversation with your best friend if it&rsquo;s some</p>
<p>meaningless bullshit and you wouldn&rsquo;t respond to your best friend don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>respond to this person you&rsquo;re interested in like if it&rsquo;s just stupid fucking shit</p>
<p>stop responding like make them know like come to me with something good to say or</p>
<p>like no you know like I enjoy talking to you like alright I&rsquo;m busy I&rsquo;m gonna get</p>
<p>back to yadda yadda like talk to you later like cut the shit cut it off or</p>
<p>just don&rsquo;t respond like cut the conversation if it&rsquo;s pointless bullshit</p>
<p>you know like don&rsquo;t waste my fucking time come to me with some substance or</p>
<p>get lost one of the biggest power plays you can do from going from a simp to a</p>
<p>goddamn pimp I don&rsquo;t know what to call it but like to flip out of the simp</p>
<p>position okay so if someone has you like kind of in their back pocket and you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>been like very attentive and you&rsquo;ve been like there to like talk every time</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve wanted to and you&rsquo;ve kind of been like the pigeon waiting for the</p>
<p>food one way that you can flip it is to yank their safety blanket out from under</p>
<p>them start being inconsistent so if they&rsquo;re always able to text you and you</p>
<p>always respond stop responding stop being so consistent all the time like</p>
<p>start having other shit to do stop watching their stories stop being up</p>
<p>their fucking ass like if you&rsquo;ve consistently given someone attention and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve given it given it given it nothing is gonna change if you keep</p>
<p>giving them more if you give someone more of what they already don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>appreciate it&rsquo;s not gonna make them appreciate it so stop if you&rsquo;ve been up</p>
<p>their ass giving them so much attention and then they&rsquo;re used to that they have</p>
<p>a safety blanket kind of so snatch it from them start being inconsistent stop</p>
<p>being at their beck and call take away their safety blanket because as soon as</p>
<p>they realize oh shit like this person is not simping for me anymore they&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>start doing things to try and get your attention again because they didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>realize that they liked getting your attention until it got taken from them</p>
<p>so or it was like less often and less consistent like they&rsquo;re gonna want that</p>
<p>consistency back but that kind of goes into the intermittent reinforcement</p>
<p>addiction pattern that I warned you guys about in episode 2 so if you&rsquo;re gonna do</p>
<p>that be fucking careful because you can get someone addicted to you and they</p>
<p>will be fiending for your attention and if you don&rsquo;t give it to them they will</p>
<p>key your car and show up at your fucking house so like I said be careful but</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the best like power play you can do but don&rsquo;t make it look intentional</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t make it look like it&rsquo;s petty like stop swiping up on their stories stop</p>
<p>eating their fucking ass stop always complimenting them like stop if you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>been in the simp position this is how to get out of it this is your only chance</p>
<p>to get out of it is to completely like withdraw all the attention you were</p>
<p>giving them that was unprovoked like if they text you okay text back but like I</p>
<p>said if the conversation is boring pull it kill it let it die but stop doing all</p>
<p>the unprovoked shit stop swiping up on their stories stop telling them they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>pretty stop commenting on their shit stop liking their shit you get what I</p>
<p>mean okay so pull back anything that&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>unprovoked or like not them reaching out first and if they do start reaching out</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s your shoe in there&rsquo;s your fucking signal that they just realized</p>
<p>oh my god this person stopped responding or like whatever they probably looked</p>
<p>you up and they wondered what you were up to look busy bitch start posting</p>
<p>shit start doing other shit like look busy and then when they text you that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>your reminder and that&rsquo;s like your acknowledgement that yo they like they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>looking for me now because you took the attention away so if they don&rsquo;t ever</p>
<p>message you girl just go ahead and move on okay but if they do message you that</p>
<p>is them like showing they&rsquo;re looking for you they like the attention and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>wondering where it went so be very careful when you start giving it to them</p>
<p>again be like standoffish act unimpressed like this is really really</p>
<p>bad fucking advice because this is not gonna lead to anything healthy this is</p>
<p>like some toxic petty play a game shit I&rsquo;m really good at this like I&rsquo;m really</p>
<p>really good at playing games that&rsquo;s why I don&rsquo;t like to play them it&rsquo;s like a</p>
<p>chess master gets bored of chess okay like girl I know so much about</p>
<p>psychology and the human brain and how to toy with people I&rsquo;m bored like I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t like to do it and then like I get my own feelings caught up in it and girl</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be freaking the fuck out but yeah this is not really like the best advice</p>
<p>for something healthy but it could be it could go either way so I&rsquo;m not gonna</p>
<p>like shoot my advice down it&rsquo;s good fucking advice but I&rsquo;m just saying is it</p>
<p>gonna lead to something healthy I don&rsquo;t know but if you are in a simp position</p>
<p>and you want someone to like recognize you gain a sense of self that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>answer stop being at their beck and call stop being the pigeon looking for</p>
<p>food okay go find food somewhere else there&rsquo;s plenty of people throwing it</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s plenty of people throwing fucking bread all right I think that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>enough for this episode if this was helpful please message me about it I</p>
<p>really want feedback and I want to know if this was helpful or not and if you</p>
<p>did like eat like if you liked it a whole bunch leave this podcast the</p>
