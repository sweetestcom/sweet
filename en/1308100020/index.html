    <p>One, two, three, that&rsquo;s great, that was a good one, I&rsquo;m getting better all the time.</p>
<p>All the time.</p>
<p>Pumps, what have you had it with this week?</p>
<p>Okay, I know I&rsquo;m new to social media, but what I&rsquo;ve had it with is like chain letters</p>
<p>on social media.</p>
<p>Like remember back in the 80s, it was like you have to send this to 10 people or they&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>die or something horrible is going to happen.</p>
<p>Now it comes on social media.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, bitch, this wasn&rsquo;t fun 30 years ago.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s certainly not fun now.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s also, sometimes like it&rsquo;s engaged with a racket.</p>
<p>Like if you do this, you&rsquo;re going to get $5,000 deposited in.</p>
<p>Yeah, some of that stuff just lives forever.</p>
<p>It does.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, this wasn&rsquo;t fun forever ago.</p>
<p>I think maybe the younger generation thinks they discovered it and thinks it&rsquo;s hilarious.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m like, I like my friends too much to send this to them.</p>
<p>Did you have a pen pal?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Yeah, me neither.</p>
<p>Yeah, no.</p>
<p>Fuck that.</p>
<p>Fuck that.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t want to do that.</p>
<p>I mean, I want less people in my life.</p>
<p>Even then.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>Very small.</p>
<p>Very small.</p>
<p>Let me tell you what I&rsquo;ve had it with.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Yak mouth, Uber drivers, or cab drivers?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s insufferable when they want to be your best friend.</p>
<p>It is awful.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re like, they can&rsquo;t possibly give a shit what I&rsquo;m doing, why I&rsquo;m in town.</p>
<p>Why are they asking?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s awful.</p>
<p>Why can&rsquo;t we ride in silence?</p>
<p>People are afraid of silence.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>I have had it.</p>
<p>I have a guy that we pay sometimes to drive us to the airport, and he&rsquo;s so nice.</p>
<p>I mean, genuinely, all around, much better person than I am.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no doubt about it.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>He is genuinely kind, but the mindless, small talk that he wants to talk about, and then</p>
<p>at the end of the ride, he always follows up with a text, I hope you have a blessed</p>
<p>trip.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like a double whammy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really, and he&rsquo;s so, again-</p>
<p>So nice.</p>
<p>Salt of the earth, great guy, side hustle, schlepping people to the airport.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a hustler, which we love, a hustler.</p>
<p>I like a hustler.</p>
<p>Too much talk, too many blessed blessings for my taste.</p>
<p>So I haven&rsquo;t been using him that much anymore because I just can&rsquo;t take it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to talk to him.</p>
<p>I have a yak mouth private investigator, and I&rsquo;ll tell you what, it&rsquo;s tough.</p>
<p>I have to gear up.</p>
<p>I have to put it on my calendar that I have to call him, and then I have to gear up over</p>
<p>a number of hours.</p>
<p>Tell the listener why you would have a private investigator.</p>
<p>For my job as an attorney, sometimes I have to have papers served or people followed or</p>
<p>whatever the case may be, a supervised, like a property exchange or something like that.</p>
<p>And he is the kindest, nicest, competent, great all-around private investigator.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a 10 out of 10, except for one thing.</p>
<p>I know going in, it&rsquo;s going to be at least 30 minutes on the phone over a, thank you</p>
<p>so much for doing that.</p>
<p>Were there any issues?</p>
<p>I mean, this is a conversation we could have in less than five minutes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a yak mouth is really problematic.</p>
<p>Oh, it&rsquo;s horrible.</p>
<p>But I mean, it really does.</p>
<p>It will like paint my day in such a way that like, I&rsquo;m like, okay, you can do it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got one, you&rsquo;ve got an hour left, but you&rsquo;re going to do it.</p>
<p>Like I have to talk myself into it.</p>
<p>It sucks.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an emotional suction cup to just-</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s depleting.</p>
<p>I think yak mouths might be more dangerous than any other type of species on the planet</p>
<p>because they really do make you homicidal in your mind.</p>
<p>You know, maybe that&rsquo;s something we should pitch to like John Hopkins or something to</p>
<p>do a little study.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Like why do people have to be a yak mouth?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>What percentage of homicide victims were yak mouths?</p>
<p>What would you do if I called you from jail and said, I&rsquo;ve murdered someone?</p>
<p>I would immediately know they were a yak mouth.</p>
<p>I would immediately know somebody said a few too many words.</p>
<p>She had had it.</p>
<p>All this homicidal rage that we&rsquo;ve been brewing and cooking and petting and loving on came</p>
<p>to fruition.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s out.</p>
<p>Welcome to I&rsquo;ve Had It podcast, a podcast about positivity, rainbows, sunshine, and</p>
<p>making you a better you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Jennifer.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Angie.</p>
<p>We call her pumps.</p>
<p>And what we&rsquo;re going to do today is work on becoming better people.</p>
<p>And I want to share with you a little story, a little story about my friend, Jen Morton,</p>
<p>our producer here.</p>
<p>And we were in Los Angeles, California with Bogie.</p>
<p>We went out, the three of us.</p>
<p>I was there.</p>
<p>You went to bed early.</p>
<p>You were the first soldier to fall.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>I was the second soldier to fall because you and I have always gone to bed early, always.</p>
<p>So Jen and Bogie decide they&rsquo;re going to go out, cat around Los Angeles, right?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Big dick around Los Angeles, right?</p>
<p>Big dicks in the big, big city, right?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re on Bogie&rsquo;s Uber account, right?</p>
<p>The thing that Uber is, it&rsquo;s interesting because you rate the driver, but then the driver also</p>
<p>rates you back.</p>
<p>Oh, I didn&rsquo;t know that.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>They rate if you&rsquo;re a good passenger.</p>
<p>So like a yak mouth could give you a one star because you didn&rsquo;t yak.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Or you could give a yak mouth review.</p>
<p>A one star, which I&rsquo;ve done multiple times.</p>
<p>On yak mouths?</p>
<p>Yak mouths, one to two stars all the time.</p>
<p>All the time.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not afraid to throw those out there because Uber, they make you rate people.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, total yak mouth, unnecessary.</p>
<p>Or somebody who has a lot of food smell in the car, that&rsquo;s unnecessary as well.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, I digress.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So these two are big dick in it in Los Angeles, right?</p>
<p>And so they go out to a bar and then they probably go to another bar and then they probably</p>
<p>make another terrible decision and go to another bar, right?</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re on their way back to the hotel and Jen vomits in the side of the Uber.</p>
<p>And I want to remind you and the listener that this is Bogie&rsquo;s Uber account, right?</p>
<p>He immediately gets a one star as a passenger.</p>
<p>So Jen completely, completely torpedoes Bogie&rsquo;s five star Uber rating as the passenger.</p>
<p>You know, Bogie&rsquo;s such a gentleman.</p>
<p>Such a gentleman.</p>
<p>So congenial.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Everybody likes the guy and his Uber rating takes a nosedive.</p>
<p>The worst part of it is, just like you said, he was being very like chivalrous and we were</p>
<p>going to take separate Ubers and he says, let&rsquo;s just get in my Uber, I&rsquo;ll make sure</p>
<p>you get home, we&rsquo;ll drop you off and then I&rsquo;ll go back to the hotel.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>Being a nice guy.</p>
<p>And so because he is so chivalrous, such a gentleman, you vomit in the Uber.</p>
<p>Did you try to get the window down?</p>
<p>Well, it was, I mean, I could have just opened the door.</p>
<p>We were right in front of my house, but I was quiet.</p>
<p>I was a quiet vomiter.</p>
<p>So I just leaped all over the side and Bogie didn&rsquo;t even know that I had thrown up until</p>
<p>he got back and opened the door and was like, oh no.</p>
<p>And he still says, I couldn&rsquo;t get someone to pick me up for the longest time.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So Uber is one of these apps that I actually do a rating on because it pops up on the phone</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like, what do you rate your Uber driver?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s kind of like you have to do it to get out, to get a new Uber right.</p>
<p>You have to rate it, tip it to move on to the next Uber ride.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not a big Yelper, but there is a whole community, you know, Yelp, like the grievance</p>
<p>website.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a whole community of Yelpers.</p>
<p>And we are going to have on our podcast today the hosts of Beach Too Sandy, Water Too Wet,</p>
<p>and all they do is dramatic readings of Yelp reviews.</p>
<p>Oh my gosh.</p>
<p>You should be on their podcast.</p>
<p>You are such a good dramatic reader.</p>
<p>Speaking of how good I am at it, let me read one for you right now.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Let me read to you a one-star review left on Yelp under the subject Yelping Motherhood.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I was super looking forward to having a newborn baby because I had been talking to some people</p>
<p>who had said they had had a really good experience.</p>
<p>Calling this a disappointment is an understatement.</p>
<p>I found grueling hours with no pay and an unnatural amount of stress, which no one ever</p>
<p>fully explained.</p>
<p>Tons of hidden costs and fees.</p>
<p>If I could give it zero stars, I would.</p>
<p>I have to say though, if she would have listened to I&rsquo;ve Had It podcast episode one, she would</p>
<p>have known it was no picnic.</p>
<p>We hope to put Yelp out of business.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re whistleblowers.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re whistleblowers on motherhood.</p>
<p>I mean, right out of the gates, episode one, we told you people, toddlers are assholes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not fun.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Wrap it before you tap it.</p>
<p>Get your shit in order.</p>
<p>Throw away your purity ring.</p>
<p>You know you&rsquo;re going to have sex.</p>
<p>Get an IUD in.</p>
<p>Have the guy wrap it.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t breed.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t breed.</p>
<p>What I want to particularly say though is the costs and fees.</p>
<p>If she thinks it&rsquo;s bad as a baby, just wait.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Just wait.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Just stay dropping the bucket.</p>
<p>Let me do one more before we bring our guests on.</p>
<p>A guy on Yelp rates Reign Modern Chinese.</p>
<p>He gives it three stars.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Wait.</p>
<p>Hold on.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s Reign Modern Chinese?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the name of the Chinese restaurant.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know if it was like an art thing.</p>
<p>Just a Chinese restaurant.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Three stars.</p>
<p>I will be honest.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never eaten here, but I do know before this place opened, there used to be an abortion</p>
<p>clinic in that spot.</p>
<p>And I am man enough to admit, I&rsquo;m too afraid to eat at a Chinese place that is haunted</p>
<p>by the ghosts of 10,000 fetuses.</p>
<p>Good luck with everything though.</p>
<p>Maybe I&rsquo;ll check it out once they put a 100% ghost free sign on the door.</p>
<p>First of all, he&rsquo;s a dick.</p>
<p>Total dick.</p>
<p>Total dick.</p>
<p>I hate him.</p>
<p>Totally.</p>
<p>Starve him out.</p>
<p>Totally.</p>
<p>Totally hate him.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s bring our guests on Beach Too Sandy, Water Too Wet, the best name of a podcast</p>
<p>outside of I&rsquo;ve Had It.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a fantastic name.</p>
<p>I feel like we were meant to collaborate.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been looking at a lot of your episodes and I&rsquo;m like, yep, this is the energy.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been sending clips back and forth to each other, just laughing at every single</p>
<p>clip we found.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Well, thank you.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Thanks for being here too.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an honor.</p>
<p>Y&rsquo;all are a delight.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>And we are here with the Pumps.</p>
<p>Hello.</p>
<p>And you guys are Christine and Zandy.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the deal guys.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s not beat around the bush.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just get right into it.</p>
<p>I mean, let&rsquo;s just, let&rsquo;s deep dive right into these Yelpers.</p>
<p>Oh boy.</p>
<p>Where to begin?</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a whole world.</p>
<p>It really is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a whole underbelly of the internet.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very sinister.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, maybe that&rsquo;s just me.</p>
<p>It can be.</p>
<p>It can be.</p>
<p>A lot of these people are, you know, a little cuckoo.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I feel like I should just go right off the bat saying that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re, they&rsquo;re unhinged and they gain power from each other, especially in the forums,</p>
<p>you know, their forums.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just like a whole mess of them together.</p>
<p>And they just bounce off each other and just write the most ridiculous stuff sometimes.</p>
<p>To be fair, we&rsquo;re probably biased because what we do for the podcast is literally read</p>
<p>one star reviews over and over and over again.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s just like the Karens unite, you know?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re constantly reading.</p>
<p>We got called Karens.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Oh no.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve gotten called Karens before.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I did see that.</p>
<p>We get some hate comments that we like to do dramatic readings of.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just so good.</p>
<p>Oh fun.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s what I want to get into.</p>
<p>And it is the psychological soil of people that are aggrieved.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;ve had many bad meals.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve taken many bad flights.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been waited on by shitty waiters.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had a lot of shitty experiences.</p>
<p>I have never gone to the World Wide Web, logged in and written down the experience and then</p>
<p>clicked post because when it&rsquo;s done, I just want it to be done.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s assholes everywhere.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the holding on to the, you know, taking your revenge out in a public forum.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s kind of where it becomes too far.</p>
<p>Like we always joke that we&rsquo;re the most millennial, like least conflict oriented people.</p>
<p>Like someone will drop a soup on me and I&rsquo;m like, take 30% tip.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;d like, and yes, to be fair, like I can understand why someone would have a</p>
<p>one star experience, but yeah, I&rsquo;ve never been really brought to that point of of the</p>
<p>Yelp forums, the scary, scary world of it.</p>
<p>So what you were saying, Zandy, is like if somebody gives it a one star shitty review,</p>
<p>then people start piling on.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just they get, you know, you see all the business has one star reviews, then they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to get more and more one star reviews because all these people are like, oh, yeah,</p>
<p>these people had a bad time.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll see people say, I agree with Lewis.</p>
<p>And then they&rsquo;ll they&rsquo;ll make we think they make up these stories, but they have these</p>
<p>stories like, yeah.</p>
<p>And then everyone in the restaurant agreed with me.</p>
<p>Everyone was like stood up and walked out with me.</p>
<p>Everyone applauded.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a red map in the parking lot.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t have it.</p>
<p>And then, oh, the best are when they say, sorry, I feel like this is just our moment.</p>
<p>You like unleash the floodgates.</p>
<p>Oh, I want to hear it all.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re finally allowed to bitch about this.</p>
<p>But people will say, for example, oh, I said something and it wasn&rsquo;t even that mean.</p>
<p>And then I got kicked out and we&rsquo;re like, elaborate, like, we&rsquo;ll be the judge of that.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t leave that detail out.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t want to make themselves look bad because I&rsquo;m sure whatever they said was absolutely</p>
<p>horrible if they got kicked out.</p>
<p>Precisely.</p>
<p>Do you guys ever go on, like the producers told us people get onto Yelp and they were</p>
<p>like rape prisons, national parks, strip clubs, border crossings.</p>
<p>Strip clubs?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Border crossings.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an interesting one.</p>
<p>Border crossings.</p>
<p>Oh boy.</p>
<p>We haven&rsquo;t looked at that one.</p>
<p>That sounds wild.</p>
<p>Let me read one to you guys about, um, from the strip club.</p>
<p>Oh, please.</p>
<p>Their skin is always cold.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like lizards, lizards that show you their genitals for money.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t think you were supposed to touch the strippers.</p>
<p>Yeah, I was going to say.</p>
<p>How do they know?</p>
<p>Everybody knows they fucking touch the strippers.</p>
<p>I mean, you cannot be the oldest person on the podcast right now by a lot, you guys,</p>
<p>and say that you-</p>
<p>Four years is not a lot for the record.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a lot.</p>
<p>Four years is a lot, clearly as evidenced by this.</p>
<p>But you cannot tell me that you&rsquo;re today years old and you think that people are going to</p>
<p>titty bars and not touching titties?</p>
<p>No, no.</p>
<p>Well, I didn&rsquo;t think they were touching titties.</p>
<p>I know they got lap dances.</p>
<p>Can you believe this?</p>
<p>But I would think-</p>
<p>Do you really, really think that their slap and tickle shit isn&rsquo;t going on at a titty</p>
<p>bar?</p>
<p>Well, yeah.</p>
<p>If you pay extra.</p>
<p>Are you kidding me?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Obviously, I need to go to a strip bar and honk around on some skin.</p>
<p>On that one though, they&rsquo;re always cold there.</p>
<p>These are lizards.</p>
<p>Lizards.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re lizards.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want to be involved in that.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s one from a county jail, a five star review.</p>
<p>Five stars?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>As far as&hellip;</p>
<p>Hang on.</p>
<p>Hang on.</p>
<p>I got to get in character.</p>
<p>As far as jails go, this is the creme de la creme.</p>
<p>First off, you don&rsquo;t even need a ride.</p>
<p>They pick you up from anywhere in the county.</p>
<p>Sometimes they even get you out of bed and bring you and it&rsquo;s all free of charge.</p>
<p>Oh, I&rsquo;m telling you.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s pretty good.</p>
<p>Have you ever read a review of like a massage parlor?</p>
<p>Have we done those, Andy?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>
<p>I think we did, but I only remember because I talked about my own experience getting a</p>
<p>massage and it was so wild.</p>
<p>And I didn&rsquo;t leave a one star review, but-</p>
<p>Did you get a happy ending?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the question.</p>
<p>No, it was not very happy.</p>
<p>None of it was.</p>
<p>I was-</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>None of it was happy.</p>
<p>And the masseuse farted the entire time.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>I forgot about that.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what was going on.</p>
<p>I was just lying there and I don&rsquo;t get massages.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like massages.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not for it.</p>
<p>You were out of your comfort zone already.</p>
<p>I was very much out of my comfort zone, exactly.</p>
<p>And then I was lying there and she was walking around me doing things and like just massaging</p>
<p>me and constantly farting the whole time.</p>
<p>Did you smell it?</p>
<p>Or was it-</p>
<p>No, I didn&rsquo;t smell anything, thankfully.</p>
<p>But you could hear it.</p>
<p>There was all this like oil and stuff in the air.</p>
<p>It was like, it smelled like who knows what lotion.</p>
<p>And she farted the entire time.</p>
<p>Did she ever say, excuse me?</p>
<p>And I didn&rsquo;t say anything.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re very conflict averse.</p>
<p>So I just was lying there, just waiting for it to end.</p>
<p>And then it ended.</p>
<p>She left the room and I was just relieved.</p>
<p>And that was it.</p>
<p>I feel like this is a learning lesson.</p>
<p>I did not feel good.</p>
<p>I feel like this is a learning lesson for us though, because a lot of times we&rsquo;ll read</p>
<p>when we&rsquo;re preparing for the show and we&rsquo;re reading reviews and we&rsquo;ll say something&rsquo;s</p>
<p>fake.</p>
<p>You know, that police station one, like, oh, someone&rsquo;s just joking around.</p>
<p>And I feel like if I read somebody saying, oh, the massage therapist was just farting</p>
<p>around the whole time.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;d be like, they can&rsquo;t mean literally.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And I mean, it sounds like things like this actually happen.</p>
<p>You know?</p>
<p>The truth is-</p>
<p>It sounds like it happened to your brother.</p>
<p>It sounds like it did, unfortunately.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad that happened, nothing else.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to know anything else about his massage experiences, but yeah, that was a</p>
<p>wild one.</p>
<p>We really delve into the depths of like the shit that happens at these businesses.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s crazy.</p>
<p>I kind of want to circle back to Pimps not realizing that there is sexual activity going</p>
<p>on at Titty Bars.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that I didn&rsquo;t know there&rsquo;s sexual activity going on at Titty Bars, but I only</p>
<p>thought you touched them if you got a lap dance.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t think you just touched their boobs when they&rsquo;re dancing.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to be totally honest.</p>
<p>My sheltered Catholic school existence, I&rsquo;ve never been, and I didn&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>In my mind, you pay extra or there&rsquo;s a back room that you go to, not clammy lizard skin</p>
<p>all over you.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And if I&rsquo;m going to haul out the sagging dragons for a dance, I&rsquo;m going to lubricate them.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to have them all fresh and smell good and soft, probably wear warmer maybe.</p>
<p>Maybe they could really use a day off or just complete exfoliation because they&rsquo;re in the</p>
<p>skin business.</p>
<p>They are.</p>
<p>But the point is, if you&rsquo;re in the skin business, you have to be lubricated.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t have dry skin.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got to exfoliate.</p>
<p>Well, Zandy&rsquo;s massage therapist has a lot of openings next week.</p>
<p>No thanks.</p>
<p>So if you want to refer anybody, I&rsquo;m sure she&rsquo;s accepting new clients.</p>
<p>What would the proper etiquette be though and not say, are you farting?</p>
<p>No clue.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>For me, proper etiquette, complete silence until it&rsquo;s over.</p>
<p>And then talk about it on our podcast.</p>
<p>And your body, instead of relaxing, you&rsquo;re getting more tense as it goes on.</p>
<p>And she continues because she&rsquo;s like, I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s going on here.</p>
<p>Just panic.</p>
<p>So we get some great comments on TikTok.</p>
<p>And neither one of us are real big prolific TikTok users, but Kylie, our producer here,</p>
<p>is going to read some comments that people have written to us on TikTok that we haven&rsquo;t</p>
<p>heard yet.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re all going to then weigh in on what we think about what these people are saying</p>
<p>about the two of us.</p>
<p>Okay, Kylie.</p>
<p>Oh, I can&rsquo;t wait.</p>
<p>Let it rip.</p>
<p>This one is from Uncle Crackers.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>With a Z.</p>
<p>Z.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s important.</p>
<p>It is important.</p>
<p>If these old bags can have a podcast, so can I.</p>
<p>Honestly, Uncle Crackers, step up.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>In the link.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Totally.</p>
<p>You know what?</p>
<p>Put your money where your mouth is.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll listen to it.</p>
<p>Uncle Crackers with a Z.</p>
<p>With a Z.</p>
<p>I will too.</p>
<p>Crackers.</p>
<p>If it would have been Crackers not with a Z, I wouldn&rsquo;t have listened to it.</p>
<p>Absolutely not.</p>
<p>But with a Z, I&rsquo;m in.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Kylie, what&rsquo;s next?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Mmm.</p>
<p>Gotta love middle-aged bitter women.</p>
<p>Good thing they don&rsquo;t have much longer.</p>
<p>Oh my God.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just so thrilled they didn&rsquo;t say old women.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re middle-aged.</p>
<p>All right, Kylie, what&rsquo;s next?</p>
<p>Do you want to hear one?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s next?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just like, what&rsquo;s next?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s next?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just so thrilled they didn&rsquo;t say old women.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re middle-aged.</p>
<p>All right, Kylie, what&rsquo;s next?</p>
<p>Do you want to hear one of your actual reviews on your podcast?</p>
<p>Yeah, let&rsquo;s hear it.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>One star.</p>
<p>One star.</p>
<p>I started listening to your podcast because I loved your show.</p>
<p>Today, you went on your little liberal rant, and so I&rsquo;m done.</p>
<p>Good luck with your podcast.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that interesting anyways.</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s harsh.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not fine.</p>
<p>First of all, they want us to know they&rsquo;ve broken up with us.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my favorite.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s like a tag on, I mean, I don&rsquo;t really go on Facebook, but there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>tag somewhere that people share that&rsquo;s like, this isn&rsquo;t an airport, you don&rsquo;t have to announce</p>
<p>your departure.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s like the biggest thing in the podcast world.</p>
<p>Like people have to like shout from the rooftops when they don&rsquo;t like a podcast.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, okay, I mean, you know, you can go away.</p>
<p>My favorite thing since we&rsquo;ve been doing this is that people, if I&rsquo;m watching a television</p>
<p>show, if I&rsquo;m following somebody on Instagram, or if I&rsquo;m listening to a podcast and I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>like it, it ends there.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It ends with just me disliking it.</p>
<p>I cease the follow if it&rsquo;s on Instagram, I cease the listening if it&rsquo;s a podcast, and</p>
<p>I change the channel if it&rsquo;s a television show.</p>
<p>It just ends.</p>
<p>And then I move on to the next bright, shiny object immediately.</p>
<p>You know, unless it&rsquo;s too short.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really that easy.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s so true.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so easy.</p>
<p>But for somebody to take the time, I find this very flattering.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>They take the time to tell you how much they don&rsquo;t like you and they don&rsquo;t like your politics.</p>
<p>It means you&rsquo;re doing something right.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what we tell ourselves at least.</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s a good one.</p>
<p>And she didn&rsquo;t like our politics and she&rsquo;s leaving and she&rsquo;s unfollowing.</p>
<p>You know, she&rsquo;s hate listening.</p>
<p>I, for one, I&rsquo;m going to miss her, whoever that was, but you know what, it&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>She has to go.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;ll be another one soon.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;ll be another one.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s always another one.</p>
<p>So when you do your podcast, what are the things that you&rsquo;ve had it with?</p>
<p>Generally, I&rsquo;ve had it with people speaking to me.</p>
<p>And that does kind of relate to, well, like I&rsquo;ve been traveling a lot because I host another</p>
<p>podcast too.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re on tour.</p>
<p>And I feel like every time I travel, I have to pay extra to get the Uber that says, you</p>
<p>know, quiet, please.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;d rather not have a conversation just talked about that before you came on.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re called yak mouse.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I get in the car and they&rsquo;re like, hi, how, how are you today?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, fine.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like, where are you coming from?</p>
<p>What do you do?</p>
<p>And I, you know, sometimes I try to just like end the conversation, say, oh, comedy.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re like, tell me a joke.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, this is literally the opposite.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m too like, you know, chicken to say anything.</p>
<p>So I just go on the long, you know, rambling conversation that this person wants to have.</p>
<p>Anyway, my thing is I&rsquo;m just tired of strangers talking like I&rsquo;m, I, you know, I&rsquo;m tired.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s unnecessary.</p>
<p>Interactions.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had it with unnecessary interactions.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>We, we beat this horse all the time.</p>
<p>This horse is so fucking dead, but I&rsquo;ll tell you what, we get out our sticks and our clubs</p>
<p>and we beat it all the time because these yak mouths are ubiquitous.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re everywhere.</p>
<p>Everywhere.</p>
<p>I go, you go and check into a hotel and it&rsquo;s like, Hey, what are you in town for?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, here we go.</p>
<p>Here we go.</p>
<p>Here we go.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want them to know.</p>
<p>And they don&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like, what are you doing at six?</p>
<p>We have a happy hour.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, I have plans at six.</p>
<p>Why do you give a shit what I&rsquo;m doing at six?</p>
<p>And those are the kinds of people that will hop on Yelp because they need to tell people</p>
<p>about every experience.</p>
<p>And sometimes I write essays, like you get six paragraphs about one bad meal that they</p>
<p>had.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, I don&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t know who&rsquo;s reading this.</p>
<p>Six paragraphs?</p>
<p>Who cares?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a manifesto.</p>
<p>That is a manifesto.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s beyond a Yelp review.</p>
<p>That is a manifesto.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d love to get my hands on it.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And the FBI should put them on a watch list.</p>
<p>The FBI should put, yeah, like certain keywords.</p>
<p>We could probably be really helpful to them.</p>
<p>You probably could.</p>
<p>Like if there&rsquo;s a crime.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been able to identify a lot of the red flags on the internet.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll reach out.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll reach out to my contacts at the FBI.</p>
<p>Zandy, we need to know what you&rsquo;ve had it with in life.</p>
<p>Well, okay.</p>
<p>Mine just is completely random, but it&rsquo;s truffles.</p>
<p>Truffle everything.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I have had it with truffle oil, truffle fries, truffle hot sauce.</p>
<p>I go to a place and they upcharge for these truffle fries that don&rsquo;t even taste good.</p>
<p>I like regular fries.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like the smell of truffle.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just very&hellip;</p>
<p>Talk about ubiquitous.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t get it.</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t get it.</p>
<p>When did truffles get so popular?</p>
<p>I have no idea.</p>
<p>But now it&rsquo;s like in the last year you can&rsquo;t go anywhere that doesn&rsquo;t have a truffle fry</p>
<p>or a truffle oil something.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s so true.</p>
<p>So I have this client and he&rsquo;s a former federal judge.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m an interior designer and I have a client.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a former federal judge, but now he&rsquo;s in private practice.</p>
<p>And I just installed his vacation home in Florida.</p>
<p>And we go to the Four Seasons one night for dinner.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s from like super smart man, but he&rsquo;s from Southeastern Oklahoma.</p>
<p>So it talks like this.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re at dinner and sitting a couple of tables over there, these like really posh,</p>
<p>like Miami gay guys.</p>
<p>I mean like totally everything&rsquo;s tight.</p>
<p>Everything&rsquo;s buttoned up.</p>
<p>They look great.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So this entree comes out and it literally has like dry ice like coming out of it.</p>
<p>And then they light it on fire and it&rsquo;s like doing all this stuff.</p>
<p>And he looks over at me and he goes, fucking rich people.</p>
<p>That is like some Hunger Games shit, you know, like just so elaborate and unnecessary.</p>
<p>I think the truffle is that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like fucking rich people shit, you know.</p>
<p>Everybody then jumps on it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, okay, I&rsquo;ve got to be, you know, oh my God, they have truffles.</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s all go eat truffles.</p>
<p>Everybody&rsquo;s going to have truffles.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got truffle fries, truffle pizza, truffle pasta.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so true.</p>
<p>I mean, I feel like I equated it earlier to, and I think it&rsquo;s a different, you called it</p>
<p>elevated Zandi, but like in the 2000s they had bacon, everything.</p>
<p>It was like bacon, candles, bacon, band-aids, like bacon, bacon, bacon was like the hit</p>
<p>trend.</p>
<p>And I feel like a truffle, as Zandi said, is like an elevated version of that.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the most disliked food?</p>
<p>Like restaurant wise, is it like Mexican or Indian or Chinese?</p>
<p>People can be, okay, I&rsquo;m going to skin it.</p>
<p>People can be so racist about different places.</p>
<p>Totally.</p>
<p>Oh, I bet that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll go into like a Chinese restaurant and just make these terribly racist remarks</p>
<p>about the food and not realize that, yeah, hey, this is not what you should be.</p>
<p>Like, yeah, if you don&rsquo;t like the taste, that&rsquo;s one thing.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re like talking about how weird and exotic, there are so many people like that,</p>
<p>which we try to avoid those, but we get those so often.</p>
<p>I think what surprises me the most, though, are the reviews of your standard fast food</p>
<p>chain.</p>
<p>So why does a McDonald&rsquo;s have 450 reviews, like a certain, on the one certain corner?</p>
<p>Like who&rsquo;s taking, like why?</p>
<p>I mean, I understand reviewing like a local restaurant that you&rsquo;ve never been to before,</p>
<p>but like, I mean, in my mind, McDonald&rsquo;s is McDonald&rsquo;s, McDonald&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>People will write in and be like three stars.</p>
<p>The so-and-so was nice, but the bathrooms are a little dirty.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, why though?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re McDonald&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a McDonald&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>They even have little things you can click at the bottom that say, if you find it, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>helpful, funny or cool are the three options.</p>
<p>Those are the only three things you can do to react.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why those three, but it&rsquo;s within the Yelp community.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a thing, I guess.</p>
<p>Do they get badges?</p>
<p>Do Yelpers get like badges and like stature within the Yelp?</p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>If you get the most goals.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a badge called the Yelp Elite, and every year you have to earn your Yelp Elite</p>
<p>badge.</p>
<p>And we actually have a couple of listeners who&rsquo;ve written in and said like a little shamefully,</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;m a Yelp Elite, you know, whatever.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re like, I guess we&rsquo;ll allow it.</p>
<p>We like the self-aware ones.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Self-aware ones.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>They even have events that you can get invited to.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re an elite, they have Yelp specific events.</p>
<p>And then there are reviews of the Yelp specific events.</p>
<p>It just, I mean, it&rsquo;s never ending.</p>
<p>It just keeps going and going and going.</p>
<p>I mean, thankfully, because it gives us a job.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not complaining about that.</p>
<p>Irony&rsquo;s not lost on me, but yes.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the deal about it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m totally 100% in on reading the grievances that people get.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s so much comedy in it that somebody gets that goddamn mad that they go</p>
<p>to their device or do they go to their laptop and it&rsquo;s just keyboard courage.</p>
<p>I mean, just keyboard courage out the wazoo.</p>
<p>And then if they ever went back in, they would never say that to the manager&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>Oh, never.</p>
<p>Never.</p>
<p>Ever.</p>
<p>Ever.</p>
<p>And they probably don&rsquo;t actively try to solve the problem while they&rsquo;re at the restaurant</p>
<p>or if they, you know, if they do, because most of the time, if you give any place, even</p>
<p>a McDonald&rsquo;s, hey, I&rsquo;m pissed off.</p>
<p>She was mean to me or the bathroom&rsquo;s dirty.</p>
<p>Even they&rsquo;re going to say, oh, thanks for letting us know.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll go tend to that.</p>
<p>99.9% of the time, most people, most businesses in this huge capitalistic Mecca that is the</p>
<p>United States of America, customer service, the customer&rsquo;s always right.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to Johnny on the spot and do it.</p>
<p>So the majority of Yelp is just a jet stream of bullshit and I can&rsquo;t get enough of it.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m here for it.</p>
<p>Can you guys read to us some of your favorite Yelps to our audience?</p>
<p>A gold mine that I discovered is children review children reviewing things on this website</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s only one thing more unhinged than like an adult angry about, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>Charlie Brown Christmas or something, but it&rsquo;s a child who&rsquo;s angry about it.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re like, talk about unhinged.</p>
<p>OK, I found it, folks.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to like this.</p>
<p>This is of a movie called you may have may have heard of it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown.</p>
<p>OK.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a one star review by a teen who is 14 years old and his username is Jimbo the Eradicator.</p>
<p>So do with that information what you will.</p>
<p>And Jimbo recommends this movie only for ages 18 plus.</p>
<p>OK.</p>
<p>So no kids allowed.</p>
<p>And this is what he has to say.</p>
<p>This is not for kids.</p>
<p>The word blockhead is used among other bullying.</p>
<p>Linus and Sally have constant sexual innuendo.</p>
<p>Violence is shown throughout Halloween costumes and through Snoopy&rsquo;s flying a scene.</p>
<p>Look out.</p>
<p>This title contains violence and scariness, language and sexy stuff.</p>
<p>So just be careful because, you know, these kind of movies are out there and they&rsquo;re there</p>
<p>for children, your kids and Charlie Brown.</p>
<p>That is bananas.</p>
<p>First of all, why is he even watching Charlie Brown at 14?</p>
<p>I mean, he&rsquo;s watching Charlie Brown.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>He thinks it&rsquo;s like has sexual innuendo.</p>
<p>I mean, this is very sexy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very sexy.</p>
<p>In his head.</p>
<p>All he&rsquo;s thinking about is sex.</p>
<p>It has nothing to do with Charlie Brown.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What a moron.</p>
<p>He needs to talk to, like, the school counselor.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>This is scary because this is probably indoctrination from the Yelpers.</p>
<p>Future Yelpers of America.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re integrating this into the kids and normalizing it.</p>
<p>And now the baby Yelpers.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s indoctrination.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>I think this Yelp and these kids, I think it&rsquo;s sounding really, really, really cult.</p>
<p>Something&rsquo;s wrong here.</p>
<p>Intervention.</p>
<p>Why do you think I have that contact at the FBI, you know, because of all this cult stuff</p>
<p>going on.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re, like, slowly slipping information to the feds.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Dangerous world out there.</p>
<p>No, I mean, seriously, I bet that some of these nets are really nuts.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>Oh, no doubt.</p>
<p>Well, guys, we have had so much fun.</p>
<p>Y&rsquo;all are a blast.</p>
<p>You, too.</p>
<p>This has been great.</p>
<p>It is so fun.</p>
<p>Y&rsquo;all are so much fun.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad that we have established that we&rsquo;ve all had it with truffles.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And, Christine, I am so happy that you are joining me and Pumps in our plight to get</p>
<p>rid of yak mouths and unnecessary interactions throughout, you know, the day when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>with the general public.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what podcasts are for.</p>
<p>Like, that&rsquo;s literally the point of a podcast.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Be it.</p>
<p>Be Uncle Crackers or whatever.</p>
<p>Start your own podcast.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Yak there.</p>
<p>Do it.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t talk to us in the Uber.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t ask us any personal questions.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m busy at six.</p>
<p>Fuck right on off.</p>
<p>Uncle Crackers.</p>
<p>See you later.</p>
<p>Bye-bye.</p>
<p>Send us the good ones.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>They are hysterical.</p>
<p>Fucking love them.</p>
<p>I love that she is united with us on the yak mouth.</p>
<p>I think that yak mouth is becoming universally abhorred.</p>
<p>Abore.</p>
<p>Like hated.</p>
<p>Abhorrent.</p>
<p>Abhorrent.</p>
<p>Abored.</p>
<p>Abored.</p>
<p>A-B-H-O-R-D.</p>
<p>I should have just said hated.</p>
<p>Speaking of spelling things out, we will see you next Tuesday or Thursday.</p>
<p>Like us.</p>
<p>Subscribe.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve had it with that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had it.</p>
<p>Had it.</p>
<p>Had it.</p>
<p>Had it.</p>
<p>All I can say about that is, I&rsquo;ve had it.</p>
<p>Had it.</p>
<p>Had it.</p>
<p>Had it.</p>
<p>Had it.</p>
