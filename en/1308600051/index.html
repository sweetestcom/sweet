    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>where we discuss science</p>
<p>and science-based tools for everyday life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Andrew Huberman,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology</p>
<p>at Stanford School of Medicine.</p>
<p>Today, my guest is Dr. David Burson,</p>
<p>professor of medical science, neurobiology,</p>
<p>and ophthalmology at Brown University.</p>
<p>Dr. Burson&rsquo;s laboratory is credited</p>
<p>with discovering the cells in the eye</p>
<p>that set your circadian rhythms.</p>
<p>These are the so-called</p>
<p>intrinsically photosensitive melanopsin cells.</p>
<p>And while that&rsquo;s a mouthful,</p>
<p>all you need to know for sake of this introduction</p>
<p>is that those are the cells</p>
<p>that inform your brain and body about the time of day.</p>
<p>Dr. Burson&rsquo;s laboratory has also made</p>
<p>a number of other important discoveries</p>
<p>about how we convert our perceptions</p>
<p>of the outside world into motor action.</p>
<p>More personally, Dr. Burson has been my go-to resource</p>
<p>for all things neuroscience for nearly two decades.</p>
<p>I knew of his reputation as a spectacular researcher</p>
<p>for a long period of time,</p>
<p>and then many years ago, I cold called him out of the blue.</p>
<p>I basically corralled him into a long conversation</p>
<p>over the phone, after which he invited me out to Brown,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ve been discussing neuroscience</p>
<p>and how the brain works and the emerging new technologies</p>
<p>and the emerging new concepts in neuroscience</p>
<p>for a very long time now.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to realize today</p>
<p>why Dr. Burson is my go-to source.</p>
<p>He has an exceptionally clear and organized view</p>
<p>of how the nervous system works.</p>
<p>There are many, many parts of the nervous system,</p>
<p>different nuclei and connections and circuits</p>
<p>and chemicals and so forth,</p>
<p>but it takes a special kind of person</p>
<p>to be able to organize that information</p>
<p>into a structured and logical framework</p>
<p>that can allow us to make sense of how we function</p>
<p>in terms of what we feel, what we experience,</p>
<p>how we move through the world.</p>
<p>Dr. Burson is truly one of a kind</p>
<p>in his ability to synthesize and organize</p>
<p>and communicate that information.</p>
<p>And I give him credit as one of my mentors</p>
<p>and one of the people that I respect most</p>
<p>in the field of science and medical science generally.</p>
<p>Today, Dr. Burson takes us on a journey</p>
<p>from the periphery of the nervous system,</p>
<p>meaning from the outside, deep into the nervous system,</p>
<p>layer by layer, structure by structure, circuit by circuit,</p>
<p>making clear to us how each of these individual circuits</p>
<p>work and how they work together as a whole.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a really magnificent description</p>
<p>that you simply cannot get from any textbook,</p>
<p>from any popular book, and frankly, as far as I know,</p>
<p>from any podcast that currently exists out there.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a real gift to have this opportunity</p>
<p>to learn from Dr. Burson.</p>
<p>Again, I consider him my mentor</p>
<p>in the field of learning and teaching neuroscience,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m excited for you to learn from him.</p>
<p>One thing is for certain, by the end of this podcast,</p>
<p>you will know far more about how your nervous system works</p>
<p>than the vast majority of people out there,</p>
<p>including many expert biologists and neuroscientists.</p>
<p>Before we begin, I&rsquo;d like to emphasize that this podcast</p>
<p>is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.</p>
<p>It is, however, part of my desire and effort</p>
<p>to bring zero cost to consumer information about science</p>
<p>and science-related tools to the general public.</p>
<p>In keeping with that theme,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank the sponsors of today&rsquo;s podcast.</p>
<p>Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens.</p>
<p>Athletic Greens is an all-in-one</p>
<p>vitamin mineral probiotic drink.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been taking Athletic Greens since 2012,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m delighted that they&rsquo;re sponsoring the podcast.</p>
<p>The reason I started taking Athletic Greens</p>
<p>and the reason I still take Athletic Greens</p>
<p>once or twice a day is that it helps me cover</p>
<p>all of my basic nutritional needs.</p>
<p>It makes up for any deficiencies that I might have.</p>
<p>In addition, it has probiotics,</p>
<p>which are vital for microbiome health.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done a couple of episodes now</p>
<p>on the so-called gut microbiome</p>
<p>and the ways in which the microbiome interacts</p>
<p>with your immune system, with your brain to regulate mood,</p>
<p>and essentially with every biological system</p>
<p>relevant to health throughout your brain and body.</p>
<p>With Athletic Greens, I get the vitamins I need,</p>
<p>the minerals I need, and the probiotics</p>
<p>to support my microbiome.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Athletic Greens,</p>

<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Element.</p>
<p>Element is an electrolyte drink</p>
<p>that has everything you need and nothing you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>That means the exact ratios of electrolytes are in Element,</p>
<p>and those are sodium, magnesium, and potassium,</p>
<p>but it has no sugar.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked many times before on this podcast</p>
<p>about the key role of hydration and electrolytes</p>
<p>for nerve cell function, neuron function,</p>
<p>as well as the function of all the cells</p>
<p>and all the tissues and organ systems of the body.</p>
<p>If we have sodium, magnesium, and potassium</p>
<p>present in the proper ratios,</p>
<p>all of those cells function properly,</p>
<p>and all our bodily systems can be optimized.</p>
<p>If the electrolytes are not present,</p>
<p>and if hydration is low,</p>
<p>we simply can&rsquo;t think as well as we would otherwise,</p>
<p>our mood is off, hormone systems go off,</p>
<p>our ability to get into physical action,</p>
<p>to engage in endurance and strength</p>
<p>and all sorts of other things is diminished.</p>
<p>So with Element, you can make sure</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re staying on top of your hydration</p>
<p>and that you&rsquo;re getting the proper ratios of electrolytes.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Element, you can go to drinkelement,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s lmnt.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll get a free Element sample pack</p>

<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Thesis.</p>
<p>Thesis makes what are called nootropics,</p>
<p>which means smart drugs.</p>
<p>Now, to be honest, I am not a fan of the term nootropics.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe in smart drugs in the sense that</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe that there&rsquo;s any one substance</p>
<p>or collection of substances that can make us smarter.</p>
<p>I do believe based on science, however,</p>
<p>that there are particular neural circuits</p>
<p>and brain functions that allow us to be more focused,</p>
<p>more alert, access creativity, be more motivated, et cetera.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just the way that the brain works,</p>
<p>different neural circuits for different brain states.</p>
<p>Thesis understands this.</p>
<p>And as far as I know, they&rsquo;re the first nootropics company</p>
<p>to create targeted nootropics for specific outcomes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Thesis for more than six months now,</p>
<p>and I can confidently say that their nootropics</p>
<p>have been a total game changer.</p>
<p>My go-to formula is the clarity formula,</p>
<p>or sometimes I&rsquo;ll use their energy formula before training.</p>
<p>To get your own personalized nootropic starter kit,</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m pleased to announce that the Huberman Lab Podcast</p>
<p>is now partnered with Momentus Supplements.</p>
<p>We partnered with Momentus for several important reasons.</p>
<p>First of all, they ship internationally</p>
<p>because we know that many of you are located</p>
<p>outside of the United States.</p>
<p>Second of all, and perhaps most important,</p>
<p>the quality of their supplements is second to none,</p>
<p>both in terms of purity and precision</p>
<p>of the amounts of the ingredients.</p>
<p>Third, we&rsquo;ve really emphasized supplements</p>
<p>that are single ingredient supplements,</p>
<p>and that are supplied in dosages</p>
<p>that allow you to build a supplementation protocol</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for cost,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for effectiveness,</p>
<p>and that you can add things</p>
<p>and remove things from your protocol</p>
<p>in a way that&rsquo;s really systematic and scientific.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to see the supplements</p>
<p>that we partner with Momentus on,</p>
<p>you can go to livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>There you&rsquo;ll see those supplements,</p>
<p>and just keep in mind that we are constantly expanding</p>
<p>the library of supplements available through Momentus</p>
<p>on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>And now for my discussion with Dr. David Burson.</p>
<p>Welcome.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>So nice to be here.</p>
<p>Great to have you.</p>
<p>For more than 20 years,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve been my go-to source for all things,</p>
<p>nervous system, how it works, how it&rsquo;s structured.</p>
<p>So today I want to ask you some questions about that.</p>
<p>I think people would gain a lot of insight</p>
<p>into this machine that makes them think and feel</p>
<p>and see, et cetera.</p>
<p>If you would, could you tell us how we see?</p>
<p>A photon of light enters the eye, what happens?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I mean, how is it that I look outside,</p>
<p>I see a truck drive by, or I look on the wall,</p>
<p>I see a photo of my dog, how does that work?</p>
<p>Right, so this is an old question, obviously.</p>
<p>And clearly in the end,</p>
<p>the reason you have a visual experience</p>
<p>is that your brain has got some pattern of activity</p>
<p>that it associates with the input from the periphery.</p>
<p>But you can have a visual experience</p>
<p>with no input from the periphery as well.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re dreaming, you&rsquo;re seeing things</p>
<p>that aren&rsquo;t coming through your eyes.</p>
<p>Are those memories?</p>
<p>I would say in a sense,</p>
<p>they may reflect your visual experience.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not necessarily specific visual memories,</p>
<p>but of course they can be.</p>
<p>But the point is that the experience of seeing</p>
<p>is actually a brain phenomenon.</p>
<p>But of course, under normal circumstances,</p>
<p>we see the world because we&rsquo;re looking at it</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re using our eyes to look at it.</p>
<p>And fundamentally, when we&rsquo;re looking at the exterior world,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s what the retina is telling the brain that matters.</p>
<p>So there are cells called ganglion cells,</p>
<p>these are neurons that are the key cells</p>
<p>for communicating between eye and brain.</p>
<p>The eye is like the camera,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s detecting the initial image,</p>
<p>doing some initial processing,</p>
<p>and then that signal gets sent back to the brain proper.</p>
<p>And of course, it&rsquo;s there at the level of the cortex</p>
<p>that we have this conscious visual experience.</p>
<p>There are many other places in the brain</p>
<p>that get visual input as well,</p>
<p>doing other things with that kind of information.</p>
<p>So I get a lot of questions about color vision.</p>
<p>If you would, could you explain how is it</p>
<p>that we can perceive reds and greens and blues</p>
<p>and things of that sort?</p>
<p>Right, so the first thing to understand about light</p>
<p>is that it&rsquo;s just a form of electromagnetic radiation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s vibrating, it&rsquo;s oscillating.</p>
<p>When you say it&rsquo;s vibrating, it&rsquo;s oscillating,</p>
<p>you mean that photons are actually moving?</p>
<p>Well, in a sense, photons,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re certainly moving through space.</p>
<p>We think about photons as particles,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s one way of thinking about light,</p>
<p>but we can also think of it as a wave, like a radio wave.</p>
<p>Either way is acceptable.</p>
<p>And the radio waves have frequencies,</p>
<p>like the frequencies on your radio dial.</p>
<p>And certain frequencies in the electromagnetic spectrum</p>
<p>can be detected by neurons in the retina.</p>
<p>Those are the things we see,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s still different wavelengths</p>
<p>within the light that can be seen by the eye.</p>
<p>And those different wavelengths are unpacked, in a sense,</p>
<p>or decoded by the nervous system</p>
<p>to lead to our experience of color.</p>
<p>Essentially, different wavelengths give us the sensation</p>
<p>of different colors through the auspices</p>
<p>of different neurons that are tuned</p>
<p>to different wavelengths of light.</p>
<p>So when a photon,</p>
<p>so when a little bit of light hits my eye, goes in,</p>
<p>the photoreceptors convert that into electrical signal.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>How is it that a given photon of light</p>
<p>gives me the perception,</p>
<p>eventually leads to the perception</p>
<p>of red versus green versus blue?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So if you imagine that in the first layer of the retina,</p>
<p>where this transformation occurs</p>
<p>from electromagnetic radiation into neural signals,</p>
<p>that you have different kinds of sensitive cells</p>
<p>that are expressing,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re making different molecules within themselves</p>
<p>for this express purpose of absorbing photons,</p>
<p>which is the first step in the process of seeing.</p>
<p>Now, it turns out that altogether,</p>
<p>there are about five proteins like this</p>
<p>that we need to think about in the typical retina.</p>
<p>But for seeing color, really, it&rsquo;s three of them.</p>
<p>So there are three different proteins.</p>
<p>Each absorbs light with a different preferred frequency,</p>
<p>and then the nervous system keeps track</p>
<p>of those signals, compares and contrasts them</p>
<p>to extract some understanding</p>
<p>of the wavelength composition of light.</p>
<p>So you can see just by looking at a landscape,</p>
<p>oh, it must be late in the day</p>
<p>because things are looking golden.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all a function of our absorbing the light</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s coming from the world</p>
<p>and interpreting that with our brain</p>
<p>because of the different composition</p>
<p>of the light that&rsquo;s reaching our eyes.</p>
<p>Is it fair to assume that my perception of red</p>
<p>is the same as your perception of red?</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s a great question.</p>
<p>And that mine is better?</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m just kidding, I&rsquo;m just kidding.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a great question.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a deep philosophical question.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a question that really probably</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t even ultimately be answered</p>
<p>by the usual empirical scientific processes</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s really about an individual&rsquo;s experience.</p>
<p>What we can say is that the biological mechanisms</p>
<p>that we think are important for seeing color, for example,</p>
<p>seem to be very highly similar</p>
<p>from one individual to the next,</p>
<p>whether it be human beings or other animals.</p>
<p>And so we think that the physiological process</p>
<p>looks very similar on the front end.</p>
<p>But once you&rsquo;re at the level of perception</p>
<p>or understanding or experience,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s a little bit tougher to nail down</p>
<p>with the sorts of scientific approaches</p>
<p>that we approach biological vision with, let&rsquo;s say.</p>
<p>You mentioned that there are five</p>
<p>different cone types, essentially,</p>
<p>cones being the cells that absorb light</p>
<p>of different wavelengths.</p>
<p>I often wondered when I had my dog,</p>
<p>what he saw and how his vision differs from our vision.</p>
<p>And certainly there are animals that can see things</p>
<p>that we can&rsquo;t see.</p>
<p>What are some of the more outrageous examples of that?</p>
<p>Of seeing things that we can&rsquo;t?</p>
<p>And in the extreme,</p>
<p>you know, dogs, I&rsquo;m guessing, see reds more as oranges.</p>
<p>Is that right?</p>
<p>Because they don&rsquo;t have the same array of neurons</p>
<p>that we have for seeing color.</p>
<p>Right, so the first thing is,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not really five types of cones.</p>
<p>There are really three types of cones.</p>
<p>And if you look at the way that color vision</p>
<p>is thought to work, you can sort of see</p>
<p>that it has to be three different signals.</p>
<p>There are a couple of other types of pigments.</p>
<p>One is really mostly for dim light vision.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re walking around in a moonless night</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re seeing things with very low light,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the rod cell that uses its own pigment.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s another class of pigments</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll probably talk about a little bit later,</p>
<p>this melanopsin pigment.</p>
<p>I thought you were referring to like ultraviolet</p>
<p>and infrared and things of that sort.</p>
<p>Right, so in the case of a typical,</p>
<p>well, let&rsquo;s put it this way, in human beings,</p>
<p>most of us have three cone types</p>
<p>and we can see colors that stem from that.</p>
<p>In most mammals, including your dog or your cat,</p>
<p>there really are only two cone types.</p>
<p>And that limits the kind of vision that they can have</p>
<p>in the domain of wavelength or color, as you would say.</p>
<p>So really a dog sees the world kind of like</p>
<p>a particular kind of colorblind human might see the world,</p>
<p>because instead of having three channels</p>
<p>to compare and contrast, they only have two channels.</p>
<p>And that makes it much more difficult to figure out</p>
<p>exactly which wavelength you&rsquo;re looking at.</p>
<p>Do colorblind people suffer much</p>
<p>as a consequence of being colorblind?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s like so many other disabilities.</p>
<p>The world is built for people of the most common type.</p>
<p>So in some cases, the expectation can be there</p>
<p>that somebody can see something that they won&rsquo;t be able to</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re missing one of their cone types, let&rsquo;s say.</p>
<p>So in those moments, that can be a real problem.</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s a lack of contrast to their visual system,</p>
<p>they will be blind to that.</p>
<p>In general, it&rsquo;s a fairly modest visual limitation</p>
<p>as things go.</p>
<p>For example, if not being able to see acutely</p>
<p>can be much more damaging,</p>
<p>not being able to read fine print, for example.</p>
<p>Yeah, I suppose if I had to give up</p>
<p>the ability to see certain colors</p>
<p>or give up the ability to see clearly,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d certainly trade out color for clarity.</p>
<p>Right, of course, color is very meaningful to us</p>
<p>as human beings, so we would hate to give it up.</p>
<p>But obviously, dogs and cats and all kinds of other mammals</p>
<p>do perfectly well in the world.</p>
<p>Yeah, because we take care of them.</p>
<p>I spent most of my time taking care of that dog.</p>
<p>He took care of me too.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about that odd photopigment.</p>
<p>Photopigment, of course, being the thing</p>
<p>that absorbs light of a particular wavelength.</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s talk about these specialized ganglion cells</p>
<p>that communicate certain types of information</p>
<p>from eye to the brain</p>
<p>that are so important for so many things.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m referring to here, of course,</p>
<p>is your co-discovery of the so-called</p>
<p>intrinsically photosensitive cells,</p>
<p>the neurons in the eye that do so many of the things</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t actually have to do with perception,</p>
<p>but have to do with important biological functions.</p>
<p>What I would love for you to do is explain to me</p>
<p>why once I heard you say,</p>
<p>we have a bit of fly eye in our eye,</p>
<p>and you showed this slide of a giant fly</p>
<p>from a horror movie trying to attack this woman,</p>
<p>and maybe it was an eye also.</p>
<p>So what does it mean that we have a bit of a fly eye</p>
<p>in our eye?</p>
<p>Yeah, so this last pigment is a really peculiar one.</p>
<p>One can think about it as really</p>
<p>the initial sensitive element in a system</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s designed to tell your brain</p>
<p>about how bright things are in your world.</p>
<p>And the thing that&rsquo;s really peculiar about this pigment</p>
<p>is that it&rsquo;s in the wrong place, in a sense.</p>
<p>When you think about the structure of the retina,</p>
<p>you think about a layer cake, essentially.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got this thin membrane at the back of your eye,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s actually a stack of thin layers.</p>
<p>And the outermost of those layers</p>
<p>is where these photoreceptors</p>
<p>you were talking about earlier are sitting.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where the film of your camera is, essentially.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where the photons do their magic</p>
<p>with the photopigments and turn it into a neural signal.</p>
<p>I like that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never really thought of the photoreceptors</p>
<p>as the film of the camera, but that makes sense.</p>
<p>Yeah, or like the sensitive chip,</p>
<p>a CCD chip in your cell phone.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the surface on which the light pattern</p>
<p>is imaged by the optics of the eye,</p>
<p>and now you&rsquo;ve got an array of sensors</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s capturing that information</p>
<p>and creating a bitmap, essentially.</p>
<p>But now it&rsquo;s in neural signals</p>
<p>distributed across the surface of the retina.</p>
<p>So all of that was known to be going on 150 years ago.</p>
<p>A couple of types of photoreceptors, cones and rods.</p>
<p>If you look a little bit more closely, three types of cones.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where the transformation</p>
<p>from electromagnetic radiation</p>
<p>to neural signals was thought to take place.</p>
<p>But it turns out that this last photopigment</p>
<p>is in the other end of the retina,</p>
<p>the innermost part of the retina.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where the so-called ganglion cells are.</p>
<p>Those are the cells that talk to the brain,</p>
<p>the ones that actually can communicate directly</p>
<p>what information comes to them from the photoreceptors.</p>
<p>And here you&rsquo;ve got a case where actually</p>
<p>some of the output neurons that we didn&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>had any business being directly sensitive to light</p>
<p>were actually making this photopigment,</p>
<p>absorbing light and converting that to neural signals</p>
<p>and sending it to the brain.</p>
<p>So that made it pretty surprising and unexpected,</p>
<p>but there are many surprising things about these cells.</p>
<p>So, and what is the relationship to the fly eye?</p>
<p>Right, so the link there is that if you ask</p>
<p>how the photopigment now communicates downstream</p>
<p>from the initial absorption event</p>
<p>to get to the electrical signal,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a complex cellular process.</p>
<p>It involves many chemical steps.</p>
<p>And if you look at how photoreceptors in our eyes work,</p>
<p>you can see what that cascade is, how that chain works.</p>
<p>If you look in the eyes of flies or other insects</p>
<p>or other invertebrates,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a very similar kind of chain,</p>
<p>but the specifics of how the signals get</p>
<p>from the absorption event by the pigment</p>
<p>to the electrical response that the nervous system</p>
<p>can understand are characteristically different</p>
<p>between fuzzy, furry creatures like us</p>
<p>and insects, for example, like the fly.</p>
<p>I see.</p>
<p>So these funny extra photoreceptors</p>
<p>that are in the wrong layer</p>
<p>doing something completely different</p>
<p>are actually using a chemical cascade</p>
<p>that looks much more like what you would see</p>
<p>in a fly photoreceptor</p>
<p>than what you would see in a human photoreceptor,</p>
<p>a rod or a cone, for example.</p>
<p>So it sounds like it&rsquo;s a very primitive part of,</p>
<p>primitive aspect of biology that we maintain.</p>
<p>Exactly right.</p>
<p>You know, and despite the fact</p>
<p>that dogs can&rsquo;t see as many colors as we can</p>
<p>and cats can&rsquo;t see as many colors as we can,</p>
<p>we have all this extravagant stuff for seeing color.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;ve got this other pigment</p>
<p>sitting in the wrong, not wrong,</p>
<p>but in a different part of the eye,</p>
<p>sending, processing light very differently</p>
<p>and sending that information into the brain.</p>
<p>So what do these cells do?</p>
<p>I mean, presumably they&rsquo;re there for a reason.</p>
<p>They are.</p>
<p>And the interesting thing is that one cell type like this,</p>
<p>carrying one kind of signal,</p>
<p>which I would call a brightness signal, essentially,</p>
<p>can do many things in the brain.</p>
<p>When you say brightness signal,</p>
<p>you mean that it, like right now,</p>
<p>I have these cells.</p>
<p>Do I have these cells?</p>
<p>You do. Of course not.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m joking.</p>
<p>I hope I have these cells in my eye.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re paying attention to how bright it is overall,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re not paying attention, for instance,</p>
<p>to the edge of your ear</p>
<p>or what else is going on in the room.</p>
<p>Right, so it&rsquo;s the difference</p>
<p>between knowing what the objects are on the table</p>
<p>and knowing whether it&rsquo;s bright enough</p>
<p>to be daylight right now.</p>
<p>So why does your nervous system</p>
<p>need to know whether it&rsquo;s daylight right now?</p>
<p>Well, one thing that needs to know,</p>
<p>that is your circadian clock.</p>
<p>You know, if you travel across time zones to Europe,</p>
<p>now your internal clock thinks it&rsquo;s California time,</p>
<p>but the rotation of the earth</p>
<p>is for a different part of the planet.</p>
<p>The rising and setting of the sun</p>
<p>is not at all what your body is anticipating.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve got an internal representation</p>
<p>of the rotation of the earth in your own brain.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s your circadian system.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s keeping time.</p>
<p>But now you&rsquo;ve played a trick on your nervous system.</p>
<p>You put yourself in a different place</p>
<p>where the sun is rising at the quote, wrong time.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s not good for you, right?</p>
<p>So you gotta get back on track.</p>
<p>One of the things this system does</p>
<p>is sends a, oh, it&rsquo;s daylight now signal to the brain,</p>
<p>which compares with its internal clock.</p>
<p>And if that&rsquo;s not right, it tweaks the clock gradually</p>
<p>until you get over your jet lag</p>
<p>and you feel back on track again.</p>
<p>So the jet lag case makes a lot of sense to me,</p>
<p>but presumably these elements didn&rsquo;t evolve for jet lag.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So what are they doing on a day-to-day basis?</p>
<p>Right, well, one way to think about this</p>
<p>is that the clock that you have in not just your brain,</p>
<p>in all the cells, almost all of the cells of your body,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re all oscillating.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all, you know.</p>
<p>They got little clocks in them.</p>
<p>Little clocks in themselves.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all clocks.</p>
<p>You know, they need to be synchronized appropriately.</p>
<p>And the whole thing has to be built</p>
<p>in biological machinery.</p>
<p>This is actually a beautiful story</p>
<p>about how gene expression can control gene expression.</p>
<p>And if you set it up right,</p>
<p>you can set up a little thing that just sort of hums along</p>
<p>at a particular frequency.</p>
<p>In our case, it&rsquo;s humming along at 24 hours</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s how our earth rotates</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s all built into our biology.</p>
<p>So this is great, but the reality is</p>
<p>that the clock can only be so good.</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;re talking about biology here.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not precision engineering.</p>
<p>And so it can be a little bit off.</p>
<p>Well, also it doesn&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s in our brain.</p>
<p>So it doesn&rsquo;t have access to any regular unerring signal.</p>
<p>Well, if in the absence of the rising</p>
<p>and setting of the sun, it doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>If you put someone in a cave,</p>
<p>their biological clock will keep time</p>
<p>to within a handful of minutes of 24 hours.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s no problem for one day.</p>
<p>But if this went on without any correction,</p>
<p>eventually you&rsquo;d be out of phase.</p>
<p>And this is actually one of the things</p>
<p>that blind patients often complain about.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve got retinal blindness.</p>
<p>Their retina is insomnia and-</p>
<p>Because their brain&rsquo;s awake in the middle of the night.</p>
<p>Exactly, they&rsquo;re not synchronized.</p>
<p>Their clock is there, but they&rsquo;re drifting out of phase</p>
<p>because their clock&rsquo;s only good to, you know,</p>
<p>24.2 hours or 23.8 hours.</p>
<p>Little by little, they&rsquo;re drifting.</p>
<p>So you need a synchronization signal.</p>
<p>So even if you never cross time zones,</p>
<p>and of course we didn&rsquo;t back on the Savannah,</p>
<p>we stayed within walking distance of where we were,</p>
<p>you still need a synchronizer</p>
<p>because otherwise you have nothing to actually confirm</p>
<p>when the rising and the setting of the sun is.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re trying to synchronize yourself to.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m fascinated by the circadian clock</p>
<p>and the fact that all the cells of our body</p>
<p>have essentially a 24-hour-ish clock in them.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>We hear a lot about these circadian rhythms</p>
<p>and circadian clocks,</p>
<p>the fact that we need light input from these special neurons</p>
<p>in order to set the clock,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve never really heard it described</p>
<p>how the clock itself works</p>
<p>and how the clock signals to all the rest of the body</p>
<p>when the liver should be doing one thing</p>
<p>and when the stomach should be doing another.</p>
<p>I know you&rsquo;ve done some work on the clock.</p>
<p>So if you would just maybe briefly describe</p>
<p>where the clock is, what it does,</p>
<p>and some of the top contour</p>
<p>of how it tells the cells of the body what to do.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So the first thing to say is that, as you said,</p>
<p>the clock is all over the place.</p>
<p>Most of the tissues in your body have clocks.</p>
<p>We probably have, what, millions of clocks in our body.</p>
<p>Yeah, I would say that&rsquo;s probably fair.</p>
<p>If you have millions of cell types,</p>
<p>you probably may have millions of clocks.</p>
<p>But the role of the central pacemaker</p>
<p>for the circadian system is to coordinate all of these.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a little nucleus,</p>
<p>a little collection of nerve cells in your brain</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s called the suprachiasmatic nucleus, the SCN.</p>
<p>And it is sitting in a funny place</p>
<p>for the rest of the structures in the nervous system</p>
<p>that get direct retinal input.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sitting in the hypothalamus,</p>
<p>which you can think about</p>
<p>as sort of the great coordinator of drives and-</p>
<p>The source of all our pleasures and all our problems.</p>
<p>Right. Or most our problems.</p>
<p>Yes, it really is.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s sort of, you know, deep in your brain,</p>
<p>things that drive you to do things.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re freezing cold, you put on a coat, you shiver.</p>
<p>All these things are coordinated by the hypothalamus.</p>
<p>So this pathway that we&rsquo;re talking about from the retina</p>
<p>and from these peculiar cells</p>
<p>that are encoding light intensity</p>
<p>are sending signals directly into a center</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s surrounded by all of these centers</p>
<p>that control autonomic nervous system</p>
<p>and your hormonal systems.</p>
<p>So this is a part of your visual system</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t really reach the level of consciousness.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not something you think about.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s happening under the radar kind of all the time.</p>
<p>And the signal is working its way</p>
<p>into this central clock coordinating center.</p>
<p>Now, what happens then is not that well understood,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s clear that this is a neural center</p>
<p>that has the same ability to communicate</p>
<p>with other parts of your brain as any other neural center.</p>
<p>And clearly there are circuits</p>
<p>that involve connections between neurons</p>
<p>that are conventional.</p>
<p>But in addition, it&rsquo;s quite clear</p>
<p>that there are also sort of humoral effects,</p>
<p>that things are oozing out of the cells in the center</p>
<p>and maybe into the circulation</p>
<p>or just diffusing through the brain to some extent</p>
<p>that can also affect neurons elsewhere.</p>
<p>But the hypothalamus uses everything</p>
<p>to control the rest of the bodies.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s true of the suprachiasmatic nucleus,</p>
<p>this circadian center as well.</p>
<p>It can get its fingers into the autonomic nervous system,</p>
<p>the humoral system, and of course,</p>
<p>up to the centers of the brain</p>
<p>that organize coordinated rational behavior.</p>
<p>So if I understand correctly,</p>
<p>we have this group of cells, the suprachiasmatic nucleus.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s got a 24-hour rhythm.</p>
<p>That rhythm is more or less matched</p>
<p>to what&rsquo;s going on in our external world</p>
<p>by the specialized set of neurons in our eye.</p>
<p>But then the master clock itself, the SCN,</p>
<p>releases things in the blood, humoral signals,</p>
<p>that go out various places in the body.</p>
<p>And then you said to the autonomic system,</p>
<p>which is regulating more or less how alert or calm we are,</p>
<p>as well as our thinking and our cognition.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;d love to talk to you about the autonomic part.</p>
<p>Presumably that&rsquo;s through melatonin.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s through adrenaline.</p>
<p>How is it that this clock is impacting</p>
<p>how the autonomic system, how alert or calm we feel?</p>
<p>Right, so there are pathways</p>
<p>by which the suprachiasmatic nucleus can access</p>
<p>both the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous system.</p>
<p>Just so people know, the sympathetic nervous system</p>
<p>is the one that tends to make us more alert,</p>
<p>and the parasympathetic nervous system</p>
<p>is the portion of the autonomic nervous system</p>
<p>that makes us feel more calm in broad context.</p>
<p>To first approximation, right.</p>
<p>So this is, both of these systems are within the grasp</p>
<p>of the circadian system through hypothalamic circuits.</p>
<p>One of the circuits that will be,</p>
<p>I think of particular interest to some of your listeners,</p>
<p>is a pathway that involves this sympathetic branch</p>
<p>of the autonomic nervous system, the fight or flight system,</p>
<p>that is actually through a very circuitous route</p>
<p>innervating the pineal gland,</p>
<p>which is sitting in the middle of your brain.</p>
<p>The so-called third eye.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So this is the-</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll have to get back to why it&rsquo;s called the third eye,</p>
<p>because, yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an interesting history.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t call something the third eye and not,</p>
<p>and just, you know.</p>
<p>Just leave it there.</p>
<p>Just leave it there.</p>
<p>Right. Right.</p>
<p>Anyway, this is the major source of melatonin in your body.</p>
<p>So light comes into my eye.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Passed off to the suprachiasmatic nucleus,</p>
<p>essentially not the light itself,</p>
<p>but the signal representing the light.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Then the SCN, the suprachiasmatic nucleus,</p>
<p>can impact the melatonin system via the pineal.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>The way this is seen is that if you were to measure</p>
<p>your melatonin level over the course of the day,</p>
<p>if you could do this, you know, hour by hour,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d see that it&rsquo;s really low during the day,</p>
<p>very high at night.</p>
<p>But if you get up in the middle of the night</p>
<p>and go to the bathroom</p>
<p>and turn on the bright fluorescent light,</p>
<p>your melatonin level is slammed to the floor.</p>
<p>Light is directly impacting your hormonal levels</p>
<p>through this mechanism that we just described.</p>
<p>So this is one of the routes by which light can act</p>
<p>on your hormonal status through pathways</p>
<p>that are completely beyond</p>
<p>what you normally would think about, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re thinking about the things in the bathroom.</p>
<p>Oh, there&rsquo;s the toothbrush.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s the tube of toothpaste.</p>
<p>But meanwhile, this other system is just counting photons</p>
<p>and saying, oh, wow, there&rsquo;s a lot of photons right now.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s shut down the melatonin release.</p>
<p>This is one of the main reasons why I&rsquo;ve encouraged people</p>
<p>to avoid bright light exposure in the middle of the night,</p>
<p>not just blue light, but bright light of any wavelength,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s this myth out there that blue light,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s the optimal signal for activating this pathway</p>
<p>and shutting down melatonin,</p>
<p>is the only wavelength of light that can shut it down.</p>
<p>Am I correct in thinking that if a light is bright enough,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t matter if it&rsquo;s blue light, green light,</p>
<p>purple light, even red light,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to slam melatonin down to the ground,</p>
<p>which is not a good thing to happen</p>
<p>in the middle of the night, correct?</p>
<p>Right, yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, any light will affect the system to some extent.</p>
<p>The blue light is somewhat more effective,</p>
<p>but don&rsquo;t fool yourself into thinking</p>
<p>that if you use red light,</p>
<p>that means you&rsquo;re avoiding the effect.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s certainly still there,</p>
<p>and certainly if it&rsquo;s very bright,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll be more effective in driving the system</p>
<p>than dim blue light would be.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>A lot of people wear blue blockers,</p>
<p>and in a kind of odd twist of misinformation out there,</p>
<p>a lot of people wear blue blockers</p>
<p>during the middle of the day,</p>
<p>which basically makes no sense,</p>
<p>because during the middle of the day</p>
<p>is when you want to get a lot of bright light,</p>
<p>and including blue light into your eyes, correct?</p>
<p>Absolutely, and not just for the reasons</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve been talking about in terms of circadian effects.</p>
<p>There are major effects of light on mood,</p>
<p>and seasonal affective disorder</p>
<p>apparently is essentially a reflection</p>
<p>of this same system in reverse.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re living in the northern climes,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re not getting that much light</p>
<p>during the middle of the winter in Stockholm,</p>
<p>you might be prone to depression,</p>
<p>and phototherapy might be just the ticket for you,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s because there&rsquo;s a direct effect</p>
<p>of light on mood.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an example where if you don&rsquo;t have enough light,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a problem.</p>
<p>So I think you&rsquo;re exactly right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not about is light good or bad for you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about what kind of light and when</p>
<p>that makes the difference.</p>
<p>Yeah, the general rule of thumb that I&rsquo;ve been living by</p>
<p>is to get as much bright light in my eyes,</p>
<p>ideally from sunlight, anytime I want to be alert,</p>
<p>and doing exactly the opposite when I want to be asleep</p>
<p>or getting drowsy.</p>
<p>And there are aspects of this</p>
<p>that spin out way beyond the conversation we&rsquo;re having now</p>
<p>to things like this.</p>
<p>It turns out that the incidence of myopia-</p>
<p>Nearsightedness.</p>
<p>Nearsightedness, right,</p>
<p>is strongly related to the amount of time</p>
<p>that kids spend outdoors.</p>
<p>In what direction of effect?</p>
<p>The more they spend time outdoors,</p>
<p>the less nearsightedness they have.</p>
<p>So this is all about-</p>
<p>And is that because they&rsquo;re viewing things at a distance</p>
<p>or because they&rsquo;re getting a lot of blue light, sunlight?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a great question.</p>
<p>It is not fully resolved what the epidemiological,</p>
<p>what the basis of that epidemiological finding is.</p>
<p>One possibility is the amount of light,</p>
<p>which would make me think about</p>
<p>this melanopsin system again,</p>
<p>but it might very well be a question of accommodation.</p>
<p>That is the process by which you focus on near or far things.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re never outdoors, everything is nearby.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re outdoors, you&rsquo;re focusing far.</p>
<p>So this is-</p>
<p>Well, unless you&rsquo;re on your phone.</p>
<p>Right, exactly.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a tremendous amount of interest these days</p>
<p>in watches and things that count steps.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m beginning to realize that we should probably have</p>
<p>a device that can count photons during the day</p>
<p>and can also count photons at night and tell us,</p>
<p>hey, you&rsquo;re getting too many photons.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to shut down your melatonin at night</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re not getting enough photons.</p>
<p>Today, you didn&rsquo;t get enough bright light,</p>
<p>whether or not it&rsquo;s from artificial light or from sunlight.</p>
<p>I guess that, where would you put it?</p>
<p>I guess you&rsquo;d put it on the top of your head</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;d probably want it someplace outward facing.</p>
<p>Right, probably what you need is as many photons</p>
<p>over as much of the retina as possible</p>
<p>to recruit as much of the system as possible.</p>
<p>In thinking about other effects</p>
<p>of this non-image forming pathway</p>
<p>that involves these special cells in the eye and the SCN,</p>
<p>you had a paper a few years ago</p>
<p>looking at retinal input to an area of the brain,</p>
<p>which has a fancy name, the perihabenula,</p>
<p>but names don&rsquo;t necessarily matter,</p>
<p>that had some important effects on mood</p>
<p>and other aspects of light.</p>
<p>Maybe you could tell us a little bit about</p>
<p>what is the perihabenula?</p>
<p>Oh, wow, so that&rsquo;s a fancy term,</p>
<p>but I think the way to think about this</p>
<p>is it&rsquo;s a chunk of the brain</p>
<p>that is sitting as part of a bigger chunk</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really the linker</p>
<p>between peripheral sensory input of all kinds,</p>
<p>virtually all kinds,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s auditory input or tactile input</p>
<p>or visual input to the region of your brain, the cortex,</p>
<p>that allows you to think about these things</p>
<p>and make plans around them</p>
<p>and to integrate them and that kind of thing.</p>
<p>So, you know, we&rsquo;ve known about a pathway</p>
<p>that gets from the retina</p>
<p>through this sort of linker center,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s called the thalamus,</p>
<p>and then on up to the cortex.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a train station.</p>
<p>Exactly, but you want to arrive at the destination, right?</p>
<p>Now you&rsquo;re at Grand Central</p>
<p>and now you can do your thing</p>
<p>as you&rsquo;re up at the cortex.</p>
<p>So, this is the standard pattern.</p>
<p>You have sensory input coming from the periphery,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got these peripheral elements</p>
<p>that are doing the initial stages of the-</p>
<p>The eye, the ear, the nose.</p>
<p>The eye, the skin of your fingertips, right?</p>
<p>You know, the taste buds on your tongue,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re taking this raw information in</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re doing some pre-processing maybe,</p>
<p>or, you know, the early circuits are,</p>
<p>but eventually most of these signals</p>
<p>have to pass through the gateway to the cortex,</p>
<p>which is the thalamus.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve known for years, for decades, many decades,</p>
<p>what the major throughput pathway</p>
<p>from the retina to the cortex is</p>
<p>and where it ends up.</p>
<p>It ends up in the visual cortex.</p>
<p>You know, you pat the back of your head,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s where the receiving center is</p>
<p>for the main pathway from retina to cortex.</p>
<p>But wait a minute, there&rsquo;s more.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s this little side pathway</p>
<p>that goes through a different part</p>
<p>of that linking thalamus center,</p>
<p>the gateway to the cortex.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a local train.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>From Grand Central to-</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s in a weird part of the neuroid, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a completely different,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like a little trunk line that branches off</p>
<p>and goes out into the hinterlands</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s going to the part of this linker center</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s talking to a completely different part of cortex,</p>
<p>way up front, frontal lobe,</p>
<p>which is much more involved in things like planning</p>
<p>or self-image or-</p>
<p>Self-image, literally how one thinks about themselves.</p>
<p>Views oneself.</p>
<p>You know, do you feel good about yourself?</p>
<p>Or, you know, what&rsquo;s your plan for next Thursday?</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s a very high level center</p>
<p>in the highest level of your nervous system.</p>
<p>And this is the region that is getting input</p>
<p>from this pathway,</p>
<p>which is mostly worked out in this function</p>
<p>by Samer Hattar&rsquo;s lab.</p>
<p>I know you had him on the podcast.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t talk about this pathway.</p>
<p>This pathway at all, right.</p>
<p>So Diego Fernandez and Samer</p>
<p>and the folks that work with them</p>
<p>were able to show that this pathway doesn&rsquo;t just exist</p>
<p>and get you to a weird place.</p>
<p>But if you activate it at kind of the wrong time of day,</p>
<p>animals can become depressed.</p>
<p>And if you silence it under the right circumstances,</p>
<p>then weird lighting cycles</p>
<p>that would normally make them act sort of depressed</p>
<p>no longer have that effect.</p>
<p>So it sounds to me like there&rsquo;s this pathway</p>
<p>from eye to this unusual train route</p>
<p>through the structure we call the thalamus,</p>
<p>then up to the front of the brain</p>
<p>that relates to things of self-perception,</p>
<p>kind of higher level functions.</p>
<p>I find that really interesting</p>
<p>because most of what I think about</p>
<p>when I think about these fancy,</p>
<p>well, or these primitive rather,</p>
<p>neurons that don&rsquo;t pay attention to the shapes of things,</p>
<p>but instead to brightness,</p>
<p>I think of, well, it regulates melatonin, circadian clock,</p>
<p>mood, hunger, the really kind of vegetative stuff,</p>
<p>if you will.</p>
<p>And this is interesting</p>
<p>because I think a lot of people experience depression,</p>
<p>not just people that live in Scandinavia</p>
<p>in the middle of winter.</p>
<p>And we are very much divorced</p>
<p>from our normal interactions with light.</p>
<p>It also makes me realize</p>
<p>that these intrinsically photosensitive cells</p>
<p>that set the clock, et cetera,</p>
<p>are involved in a lot of things.</p>
<p>I mean, they seem to regulate a dozen or more</p>
<p>different basic functions.</p>
<p>I want to ask you about a different aspect</p>
<p>of the visual system now,</p>
<p>which is the one that relates to our sense of balance.</p>
<p>So I love boats, but I hate being on them.</p>
<p>I love the ocean from shore</p>
<p>because I get incredibly seasick.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just, it&rsquo;s awful.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;m gonna get seasick if I think about it too much.</p>
<p>And once I went on a boat trip,</p>
<p>I came back and I actually got motion sick</p>
<p>or wasn&rsquo;t seasick because I went rafting.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a system that somehow gets messed up.</p>
<p>They always tell us if you&rsquo;re feeling sick</p>
<p>to look at the horizon, et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p>So what is the link between our visual system</p>
<p>and our balance system?</p>
<p>And why does it make us nauseous sometimes</p>
<p>when the world is moving in a way</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re not accustomed to?</p>
<p>I realize this is a big question</p>
<p>because it involves eye movement, et cetera.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s maybe just walk in at the simplest layers</p>
<p>of vision, vestibular, so-called balance system.</p>
<p>And then maybe we can piece the system together</p>
<p>for people so that they can understand.</p>
<p>And then also we should give them some tools</p>
<p>for adjusting their nausea</p>
<p>when their vestibular system is out of whack.</p>
<p>Cool.</p>
<p>So, I mean, the first thing to think about</p>
<p>is that the vestibular system is designed</p>
<p>to allow you to see how you&rsquo;re, or detect,</p>
<p>sense how you&rsquo;re moving in the world, through the world.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a funny one because it&rsquo;s about your movement</p>
<p>in relationship to the world in a sense,</p>
<p>and yet it&rsquo;s sort of interoceptive</p>
<p>in the sense that it is really, in the end,</p>
<p>sensing the movement of your own body.</p>
<p>Okay, so interoception,</p>
<p>we should probably delineate for people,</p>
<p>is when you&rsquo;re focusing on your internal state</p>
<p>as opposed to something outside you.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s a gravity-sensing system.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s partly a gravity-sensing system</p>
<p>in the sense that gravity is a force</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s acting on you as if you were moving</p>
<p>through the world in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>All right, now you got to explain that.</p>
<p>You got to explain that one to me.</p>
<p>Okay, so basically the idea is that</p>
<p>if we leave gravity aside,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re just sitting in a car, in a passenger seat,</p>
<p>and the driver hits the accelerator</p>
<p>and you start moving forward.</p>
<p>You sense that.</p>
<p>If your eyes were closed, you&rsquo;d sense it.</p>
<p>If your ears were plugged and your eyes were closed,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d still know it.</p>
<p>Yeah, many people take off on the plane like this.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re dreading the flight</p>
<p>and they know when the plane is taking off.</p>
<p>Sure, that&rsquo;s your vestibular system talking</p>
<p>because anything that jostles you</p>
<p>out of the current position you&rsquo;re in right now</p>
<p>will be detected by the vestibular system pretty much.</p>
<p>So this is a complicated system,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s basically in your inner ear,</p>
<p>very close to where you&rsquo;re hearing.</p>
<p>I can put it there.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know who they is.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really know.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re sort of derived.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just kidding.</p>
<p>To steal our friend Russ Van Gelder&rsquo;s explanation,</p>
<p>we weren&rsquo;t consulted the design phase</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a great line, that&rsquo;s a great line.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s interesting it&rsquo;s in the ear.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s deep in there</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s served by the same nerve actually</p>
<p>that serves the hearing system.</p>
<p>One way to think about it is both the hearing system</p>
<p>and this vestibular self-motion sensing system</p>
<p>are really detecting the signal in the same way.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re hairy cells and they&rsquo;re excited.</p>
<p>Hairy cells?</p>
<p>Yeah, sort of.</p>
<p>Little cilia sticking up off the surfaces.</p>
<p>And depending on which way you bend those,</p>
<p>the cells will either be inhibited or excited.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not even neurons,</p>
<p>but then they talk to neurons with a neuron-like process</p>
<p>and off you go.</p>
<p>Now you&rsquo;ve got an auditory signal.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re sensing things bouncing around in your cochlea,</p>
<p>which is- Sound waves.</p>
<p>Sympathetically, the bouncing of your eardrum,</p>
<p>which is sympathetically the sound waves in the world.</p>
<p>But in the case of the vestibular apparatus,</p>
<p>evolution has built a system</p>
<p>that detects the motion of, say, fluid</p>
<p>going by those hairs.</p>
<p>And if you put a sensor like that</p>
<p>in a tube that&rsquo;s fluid-filled,</p>
<p>now you&rsquo;ve got a sensor that will be activated</p>
<p>when you rotate that tube around the axis</p>
<p>that passes through the middle of it.</p>
<p>Those who are just listening won&rsquo;t be able to-</p>
<p>No, I think that makes sense.</p>
<p>I always think of it as three hula hoops.</p>
<p>Right, three hula hoops.</p>
<p>One standing up, one lying down on the ground.</p>
<p>Right, one the other way.</p>
<p>Three directions.</p>
<p>The people who fly will talk about roll, pitch, and yaw,</p>
<p>that kind of thing.</p>
<p>So three axes of encoding,</p>
<p>just like in the cones of the retina.</p>
<p>Sort of the yes, the no, and then I always say it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>and then the puppy head tilt.</p>
<p>Yeah, the puppy head tilt.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the other one.</p>
<p>So the point is that your brain</p>
<p>is eventually going to be able to unpack</p>
<p>what these sensors are telling you</p>
<p>about how you just rotated your head</p>
<p>in very much the way that the three types of cones</p>
<p>we were talking about before</p>
<p>are reading the incoming photons</p>
<p>in the wavelength domain differently.</p>
<p>Red, green, blue.</p>
<p>Yeah, you can compare and contrast, you get red, green, blue.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s the same basic idea.</p>
<p>If you have three sensors and you array them properly,</p>
<p>now you can tell if you&rsquo;re rotating your head</p>
<p>left or right, up or down.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the sensory signal coming back into your brain,</p>
<p>confirming that you&rsquo;ve just made a movement that you will.</p>
<p>But what about on the plane?</p>
<p>Because when I&rsquo;m on the plane,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m completely stationary.</p>
<p>The plane&rsquo;s moving, but my head hasn&rsquo;t moved.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m just moving forward, gravity is constant.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>How do I know I&rsquo;m accelerating?</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s happening now is your brain is sensing the motion</p>
<p>and the brain is smart enough also to ask itself,</p>
<p>did I will that movement or did that come from the outside?</p>
<p>So now in terms of sort of understanding</p>
<p>what the vestibular signal means,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s got to be embedded in the context</p>
<p>of what you tried to do or what your other sensory systems</p>
<p>are telling you about what&rsquo;s happening right now.</p>
<p>I see, so that&rsquo;s very interesting.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not conscious, or at least if it&rsquo;s conscious,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not conscious, it&rsquo;s definitely very fast, right?</p>
<p>The moment that plane starts moving,</p>
<p>I know that I didn&rsquo;t get up out of my chair</p>
<p>and run forward. Right.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m not really thinking about getting up</p>
<p>out of my chair, I just know.</p>
<p>I guess the way I think about it is that</p>
<p>the nervous system is, quote, aware at many levels.</p>
<p>When it gets all the way up to the cortex</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re thinking about it, you&rsquo;re talking about it,</p>
<p>you know, that&rsquo;s cortical.</p>
<p>But the lower levels of the brain that don&rsquo;t require you</p>
<p>to actually actively think about it,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re just doing their thing, are also made aware, right?</p>
<p>A lot of this is happening under the surface</p>
<p>of what you&rsquo;re thinking.</p>
<p>These are reflexes.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve got this gravity sensing system.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m nodding for those that are listening,</p>
<p>for a yes movement of the head, a no movement of the head,</p>
<p>or the tilting of the head from side to side.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And then you said that knowledge about whether or not</p>
<p>activation of that system comes from my own movements</p>
<p>or something acting upon me, like the plane moving,</p>
<p>has to be combined with other signals.</p>
<p>And so how is the visual information</p>
<p>or information about the visual world</p>
<p>combined with balance information?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So, I mean, I guess maybe the best way to think about</p>
<p>how these two systems work together</p>
<p>is to think about what happens</p>
<p>when you suddenly rotate your head to the left.</p>
<p>When you suddenly rotate your head to the left,</p>
<p>your eyes are actually rotating to the right automatically.</p>
<p>You do this in complete darkness.</p>
<p>If you had an infrared camera and watched yourself</p>
<p>in complete darkness, you can&rsquo;t see anything.</p>
<p>Rotating your head to the left,</p>
<p>your eyes would rotate to the right.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s your vestibular system saying,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna try to compensate for the head rotation</p>
<p>so my eyes are still looking in the same place.</p>
<p>Why is that useful?</p>
<p>Well, if it&rsquo;s always doing that,</p>
<p>then the image of the world on your retina</p>
<p>will be pretty stable most of the time.</p>
<p>And that actually helps vision.</p>
<p>Have they built this into cameras for image stabilization?</p>
<p>Because when I move, when I take a picture with my phone,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s blurry, it&rsquo;s not clear.</p>
<p>Well, actually, you might want to get a better phone</p>
<p>because now what they have is software in the better abs</p>
<p>that will do a kind of image stabilization post hoc</p>
<p>by doing a registration of the images</p>
<p>that are bouncing around.</p>
<p>They say the edge of the house was here,</p>
<p>so let&rsquo;s get that aligned in each of your images.</p>
<p>So you may not be aware if you&rsquo;re using a good new phone</p>
<p>that if you walk around a landscape and hold your phone,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s all this image stabilization going on.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s built into standard cinematic technology now</p>
<p>because if you tried to do a handheld camera,</p>
<p>things would be bouncing around,</p>
<p>things would be unwatchable.</p>
<p>You wouldn&rsquo;t be able to really understand</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going on in the scene.</p>
<p>So the brain works really hard</p>
<p>to mostly stabilize the image of the world</p>
<p>on your retina.</p>
<p>Now, of course, you&rsquo;re moving through the world,</p>
<p>so you can&rsquo;t stabilize everything.</p>
<p>But the more you can stabilize most of the time,</p>
<p>the better you can see.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why when we&rsquo;re scanning a scene,</p>
<p>looking around at things,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re making very rapid eye movements</p>
<p>for very short periods of time, and then we just rest.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;re not the only ones that do that.</p>
<p>If you ever watch a hummingbird,</p>
<p>it does exactly the same thing at a feeder, right?</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s with its body.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to make a quick movement,</p>
<p>and then it&rsquo;s going to be stable.</p>
<p>And when you watch a pigeon walking on the sidewalk,</p>
<p>it does this funny head bobbing thing.</p>
<p>But what it&rsquo;s really doing is racking its head back</p>
<p>on its neck while its body goes forward</p>
<p>so that the image of the visual world stays static.</p>
<p>Is that why they&rsquo;re doing it?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ve seen the funny chicken videos on YouTube, right?</p>
<p>You take a chicken, move it up and down,</p>
<p>and the head stays in one place.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all the same thing.</p>
<p>All of these animals are trying hard</p>
<p>to keep the image of the world stable on their retina</p>
<p>as much of the time as they possibly can.</p>
<p>And then when they&rsquo;ve got to move,</p>
<p>make it fast, make it quick, and then stabilize again.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why the pigeons have their head back?</p>
<p>It is, yeah.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I think I just need to pause there for a second</p>
<p>and digest that.</p>
<p>Amazing.</p>
<p>In case people aren&rsquo;t, well,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no reason why people would know</p>
<p>what we&rsquo;re doing here, but essentially what we&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>is we&rsquo;re building up from sensory,</p>
<p>light onto the eye, make color,</p>
<p>to what the brain does with that,</p>
<p>the integration of that circadian clock, melatonin, et cetera.</p>
<p>And now what we&rsquo;re doing is we&rsquo;re talking about multi-sensory</p>
<p>or multimodal, combining one sense, vision,</p>
<p>with another sense, balance.</p>
<p>And it turns out that pigeons know more about this</p>
<p>than I do because pigeons know to keep their head back</p>
<p>as they walk forward.</p>
<p>All right, so that gets us to this issue of motion sickness.</p>
<p>And you don&rsquo;t have to go out on a boat.</p>
<p>Anytime I go to New York, I sit in an Uber or in a cab</p>
<p>in the back, and if I&rsquo;m looking at my phone</p>
<p>while the car is driving, I feel nauseous</p>
<p>by the time I arrive at my destination.</p>
<p>I always try and look out the front of the windshield</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m told that helps, but it&rsquo;s a little tiny window.</p>
<p>And I end up feeling slightly less sick if I do that.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s going on with the vision and the balance system</p>
<p>that causes a kind of a nausea?</p>
<p>And actually, if I keep talking about this,</p>
<p>I probably will get sick.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t throw up easily, but for some reason,</p>
<p>motion sickness is a real thing for me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a problem for a lot of people.</p>
<p>I mean, I think the fundamental problem typically</p>
<p>when you get motion sick is what they call</p>
<p>visual vestibular conflict.</p>
<p>That is, you have two sensory systems</p>
<p>that are talking to your brain</p>
<p>about how you&rsquo;re moving through the world.</p>
<p>And as long as they agree, you&rsquo;re fine.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re driving, your body senses</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re moving forward.</p>
<p>Your vestibular system is picking up</p>
<p>this acceleration of the car,</p>
<p>and your visual system is seeing the consequences</p>
<p>of forward motion in the sweeping of the scene past you.</p>
<p>Everything is honky-dory, right?</p>
<p>No problem.</p>
<p>But when you are headed forward,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re looking at your cell phone,</p>
<p>what is your retina seeing?</p>
<p>Your retina is seeing the stable image of the screen.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s absolutely no motion in that screen.</p>
<p>Or the motion is just, or some other motion,</p>
<p>like a movie or, yeah.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re playing a game, or you&rsquo;re watching a video,</p>
<p>a football game, the motion is uncoupled</p>
<p>with what&rsquo;s actually happening to your body.</p>
<p>Your brain doesn&rsquo;t like that.</p>
<p>Your brain likes everything to be aligned.</p>
<p>And if it&rsquo;s not, it&rsquo;s going to complain to you.</p>
<p>By making me feel nauseous.</p>
<p>By making you feel nauseous,</p>
<p>and maybe you&rsquo;ll change your behavior.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re getting-</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m getting punished.</p>
<p>Yeah, for setting it up</p>
<p>so your signals don&rsquo;t conflict, right.</p>
<p>By the vestibular-</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll learn.</p>
<p>Visual signals.</p>
<p>In time.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>I love the idea of reward signals.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve done a lot of discussion about this</p>
<p>on this podcast of things like dopamine reward and things,</p>
<p>but also punishment signals.</p>
<p>And I love this example.</p>
<p>Well, maybe marching a little bit further</p>
<p>along this pathway,</p>
<p>visual input is combined with balance input.</p>
<p>Where does that occur?</p>
<p>And maybe, because I have some hint of where it occurs,</p>
<p>you could tell us a little bit about this</p>
<p>kind of mysterious little mini brain</p>
<p>that they call the cerebellum.</p>
<p>Cerebellum, yeah.</p>
<p>So, you know, the way I try to describe</p>
<p>the cerebellum to my students</p>
<p>is that it serves sort of like</p>
<p>the air traffic control system functions in air travel.</p>
<p>So that it&rsquo;s a system that&rsquo;s very complicated</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s really dependent on great information.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s taking in the information</p>
<p>about everything that&rsquo;s happening everywhere,</p>
<p>not only through your sensory systems,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s listening into all the little centers</p>
<p>elsewhere in your brain that are computing</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re going to be doing next and so forth.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s just ravenous for that kind of information.</p>
<p>So it really is like a little mini brain.</p>
<p>It is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s got access to all those signals.</p>
<p>And it really has an important role</p>
<p>in coordinating and shaping movements.</p>
<p>But, you know, if you suddenly eliminated</p>
<p>the air traffic control system,</p>
<p>planes could still take off and land,</p>
<p>but you might have some unhappy accidents in the process.</p>
<p>So the cerebellum is kind of like that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that you would be paralyzed</p>
<p>if your cerebellum was gone,</p>
<p>because you still have motor neurons.</p>
<p>You still have ways to talk to your muscles.</p>
<p>You still have reflex centers.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not like you would have any sensory loss</p>
<p>because you still have your cortex</p>
<p>getting all of those beautiful signals</p>
<p>that you can think about.</p>
<p>But you wouldn&rsquo;t be coordinating things so well anymore.</p>
<p>The timing between input and output might be off.</p>
<p>Or if you were trying to practice a new athletic move,</p>
<p>like an overhead serve in tennis,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d be just terrible at learning.</p>
<p>But all of the sequences of muscle movements</p>
<p>and the feedback from your sensory apparatus</p>
<p>that would let you really hit that ball</p>
<p>exactly where you wanted to after the nth rep,</p>
<p>right in the thousandth rep or something,</p>
<p>you get much better at it.</p>
<p>So the cerebellum&rsquo;s all involved in things like</p>
<p>motor learning and refining the precisions of movements</p>
<p>so that they get you where you want to go.</p>
<p>If you reach for a glass of champagne,</p>
<p>that you don&rsquo;t knock it over or stop short.</p>
<p>You know, that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re good at.</p>
<p>People who have selective damage to the cerebellum.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>And what, like I&rsquo;m familiar with,</p>
<p>well, Korsakoff&rsquo;s is different, right?</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t that a B vitamin deficiency from,</p>
<p>in chronic alcoholics?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And they have a, they tend to walk kind of bow-legged</p>
<p>and they can&rsquo;t coordinate their movements.</p>
<p>Is that, that has some,</p>
<p>not sure about the cerebellar- Memory bodies,</p>
<p>but also cerebellum.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure about the cerebellar involvement there,</p>
<p>but you know, the typical thing would be</p>
<p>a patient who has a cerebellar stroke</p>
<p>or a tumor, for example,</p>
<p>might be not that steady on their feet.</p>
<p>You know, if the, you know,</p>
<p>dynamics of the situation,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re standing on a streetcar</p>
<p>with no pull to hold onto,</p>
<p>they might not be as good at adjusting</p>
<p>all of the little movements of the car.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s a kind of tremor that can occur</p>
<p>as they&rsquo;re reaching for things</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;ll reach a little too far</p>
<p>and then they over-correct and come back,</p>
<p>things like that.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s very common neurological phenomenon, actually.</p>
<p>Cerebellar ataxia is what the neurologists call it.</p>
<p>And it can happen not just with cerebellar damage,</p>
<p>to the tracts that feed the information</p>
<p>into the cerebellum.</p>
<p>Just deprive the structure.</p>
<p>Exactly, or output from the cerebellum.</p>
<p>And so the cerebellum is where a lot of visual</p>
<p>and balance information is combined.</p>
<p>In a very key place in the cerebellum,</p>
<p>which is, it&rsquo;s really one of the oldest parts</p>
<p>in terms of evolution. Talking about the flocculus.</p>
<p>The flocculus, right.</p>
<p>This is a, it&rsquo;s a critical place in the cerebellum</p>
<p>where visual and vestibular information comes together</p>
<p>for recording just the kinds of movements</p>
<p>we were talking about, this image-stabilizing network.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all happening there.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s learning happening there as well.</p>
<p>So that if your vestibular apparatus</p>
<p>is a little bit damaged somehow,</p>
<p>your visual system is actually talking to your cerebellum</p>
<p>saying there&rsquo;s a problem here, there&rsquo;s an error,</p>
<p>and your cerebellum is learning to do better</p>
<p>by increasing the output of the vestibular system</p>
<p>to compensate for whatever that loss was.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a little error correction system.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s sort of typical of a cerebellar function,</p>
<p>and it can happen in many, many different domains.</p>
<p>This is just one of the domains</p>
<p>of sensory-motor integration that takes place there.</p>
<p>So I should stay off my phone in the Ubers.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m on a boat, I should essentially look</p>
<p>and as much as possible, act as if I&rsquo;m driving the machine.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;d be weird if I was in the passenger seat</p>
<p>pretending I was driving the machine,</p>
<p>but I do always feel better</p>
<p>if I&rsquo;m sitting in the front seat passenger side.</p>
<p>Right, so more of the visual world that you can see</p>
<p>as if you were actually the one doing the motion,</p>
<p>I would think.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s stay in the inner ear for a minute</p>
<p>as we continue to march around the nervous system.</p>
<p>When you take off in the plane or when you land</p>
<p>or sometimes in the middle of the air,</p>
<p>your ears get clogged, or at least my ears get clogged.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s because of pressure buildup</p>
<p>in the various tubes of the inner ear, et cetera.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll get into this.</p>
<p>But years ago, our good friend, Harvey Carton,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s another world-class neuroanatomist,</p>
<p>gave a lecture and talked about how</p>
<p>plugging your nose and blowing out</p>
<p>versus plugging your nose and sucking in</p>
<p>should be done at different times</p>
<p>depending on whether or not you&rsquo;re taking off or landing.</p>
<p>And I always see people trying to unpop their ears.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And when you do scuba diving,</p>
<p>you learn how to do this without necessarily,</p>
<p>I can do it by just kind of moving my jaw now</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ve done a little bit of diving.</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s the story there?</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have to get into all the differences</p>
<p>in atmospheric pressure, et cetera.</p>
<p>But if I&rsquo;m taking off and my ears are plugged,</p>
<p>or I&rsquo;ve recently ascended, plane took off,</p>
<p>my ears are plugged, do I plug my nose and blow out</p>
<p>or do I plug my nose and suck in?</p>
<p>Right, so the basic idea is that if your ears feel bad</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re going into an area of higher pressure,</p>
<p>so if they pressurize the cabin more than the pressure</p>
<p>that you have on the surface of the planet,</p>
<p>your eardrums will be bending in and they don&rsquo;t like that.</p>
<p>If you push them more, they&rsquo;ll hurt even more.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good description that the pressure goes up,</p>
<p>then they&rsquo;re gonna bend in.</p>
<p>Bend in, and then the reverse would be true</p>
<p>if you go into an area of low pressure.</p>
<p>So if you started to drive up the mountainside,</p>
<p>the pressure is getting lower and lower outside.</p>
<p>Now the air behind your eardrum is ballooning out, right?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s just a question of, are you trying to get</p>
<p>more pressure or less pressure behind the eardrum?</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a little tube that does that</p>
<p>and comes down into your back of your throat there.</p>
<p>And if you force pressure up that tube,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna be putting more air pressure</p>
<p>into the compartment.</p>
<p>To counter it.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s not enough.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re sucking, you&rsquo;re going the other way.</p>
<p>In reality, I think as long as you open the passageway,</p>
<p>I think the pressure differential</p>
<p>is gonna solve your problem.</p>
<p>So I think you could actually blow in</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re not, quote, supposed to.</p>
<p>Okay, so you could hold your nose and blow air out</p>
<p>or hold your nose and suck in the effect.</p>
<p>Either way is fine.</p>
<p>I think so.</p>
<p>Excellent.</p>
<p>I just won $100 from Harvey Carton.</p>
<p>Thank you very much.</p>
<p>Harvey and I used to teach in our anatomy together.</p>
<p>And I was like, I don&rsquo;t think it matters,</p>
<p>but thank you, Bruce.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll split that with you.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>This is important stuff, but it&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>You hear this, so it doesn&rsquo;t matter either way.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m no expert in this area.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t worry.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t quote me.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not gonna, well, I&rsquo;m going to quote you, but.</p>
<p>Okay, so we&rsquo;ve talked about the inner ear</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ve talked about the cerebellum.</p>
<p>I want to talk about an area of the brain</p>
<p>that is rarely discussed, which is the midbrain.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And for those that don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>the midbrain is an area beneath the cortex.</p>
<p>I guess we never really defined cortex.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of the outer layers or are the outer layers</p>
<p>of the, at least mammalian brain or human brain.</p>
<p>But the midbrain is super interesting</p>
<p>because it controls a lot of unconscious stuff,</p>
<p>reflexes, et cetera.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s this phenomenon even called blindsight.</p>
<p>So could you please tell us about the midbrain,</p>
<p>about what it does and what in the world is blindsight?</p>
<p>Yeah, so this is a, there&rsquo;s a lot of pieces there.</p>
<p>I think the first thing to say</p>
<p>is if you imagine the nervous system in your mind&rsquo;s eye,</p>
<p>you see this big honking brain</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s this little wand</p>
<p>that dangles down into your vertebral column,</p>
<p>the spinal cord,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s kind of your visual impression.</p>
<p>What you have to imagine is starting in the spinal cord</p>
<p>and working your way up into this big, magnificent brain.</p>
<p>And what you would do as you enter the skull</p>
<p>is get into a little place</p>
<p>where the spinal cord kind of thickens out.</p>
<p>It still has that sort of long, skinny, trunk-like feeling.</p>
<p>Sort of like a paddle or a spoon shape.</p>
<p>Right, it starts to spread out a little bit</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s because your evolution</p>
<p>has packed more interesting goodies in there</p>
<p>for processing information and generating movement.</p>
<p>So beyond that is this tween brain we were talking about,</p>
<p>this linker brain.</p>
<p>What diencephalon really means is the between brain.</p>
<p>Oh, I thought you said tween.</p>
<p>Well, it is, yes.</p>
<p>No, no, between, between.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, I said tween.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s the between.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the between brain is what the name means.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the linker from the spinal cord in the periphery</p>
<p>up to these grand centers of the cortex.</p>
<p>But this midbrain you&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>is the last bit of this enlarged</p>
<p>sort of spinal cord-y thing in your skull,</p>
<p>which is really the brainstem is what we call it.</p>
<p>The last bit of that before you get to this relay</p>
<p>up to the cortex is the midbrain.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a really important visual center there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called the superior colliculus.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a similar center in the brains</p>
<p>of other vertebrate animals.</p>
<p>A frog, for example, or a lizard would have this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called the optic tectum there.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s a center then in these non-mammalian vertebrae</p>
<p>is really the main visual center.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t really have what we would call a visual cortex,</p>
<p>although there&rsquo;s something sort of like that.</p>
<p>But this is where most of the action is</p>
<p>in terms of interpreting visual input</p>
<p>and organizing behavior around that.</p>
<p>You can sort of think about this region of the brainstem</p>
<p>as a reflex center that can reorient the animal&rsquo;s gaze</p>
<p>or body, or maybe even attention</p>
<p>to particular regions of space out there around the animal.</p>
<p>And that could be for all kinds of reasons.</p>
<p>I mean, it might be a predator just showed up</p>
<p>in one corner of the forest and you pick that up</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re trying to avoid it.</p>
<p>Or just any movement.</p>
<p>Any movement, right?</p>
<p>It might be that suddenly something splats on the page</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re reading a novel</p>
<p>and your eye reflexly looks at it.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to think about that, that&rsquo;s a reflex.</p>
<p>What if you throw me a ball,</p>
<p>what if I&rsquo;m not expecting it?</p>
<p>And I just reach up and try and grab it, catch it or not?</p>
<p>Is that handled by the midbrain?</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s probably not the midbrain,</p>
<p>although, I mean, by itself,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s going to involve all these limb movements,</p>
<p>this movement of your arm and body.</p>
<p>And what about ducking</p>
<p>if something&rsquo;s suddenly thrown at my head?</p>
<p>Sure, right.</p>
<p>Things like that will certainly have a brainstem component,</p>
<p>a midbrain component.</p>
<p>Something looms and you duck.</p>
<p>It may not be the superior colliculus</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re talking about now.</p>
<p>It might be another part of the visual midbrain,</p>
<p>but these are centers that emerged early</p>
<p>in the evolution of brains like ours</p>
<p>to handle complicated visual events</p>
<p>that have significance for the animal.</p>
<p>In terms of space, where is it in space?</p>
<p>And in fact, this same center actually gets input</p>
<p>from all kinds of other sensory systems</p>
<p>that take information from the external world,</p>
<p>from particular locations,</p>
<p>and where you might want to either avoid or approach things</p>
<p>according to their significance to you.</p>
<p>So you get input from the touch system.</p>
<p>You get input from the auditory system.</p>
<p>I worked for a while in rattlesnakes.</p>
<p>They get input from a part of their warm sensors</p>
<p>on their face.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re in these little pits on the face.</p>
<p>You used to work on baby rattlesnakes, right?</p>
<p>Well, they were adults actually.</p>
<p>Oh, I wasn&rsquo;t trying to diminish the danger.</p>
<p>I thought for some reason they were little ones.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Why in the world would you work on rattlesnakes?</p>
<p>Well, because they have a version</p>
<p>of an extra receptive sensory system.</p>
<p>That is, they&rsquo;re looking out into the world</p>
<p>using a completely different set of sensors.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re using the same sensors</p>
<p>that would feel the warmth on your face</p>
<p>if you stood in front of a bonfire,</p>
<p>except evolution has given them</p>
<p>this very nice specialized system</p>
<p>that lets them image where the heat&rsquo;s coming from.</p>
<p>You can sort of do that anyway, right?</p>
<p>If you walk around the fire,</p>
<p>you can feel where the fire is</p>
<p>from the heat hitting your face.</p>
<p>Is that the primary way in which they detect prey?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of the major ways.</p>
<p>And in fact, they use vision as well.</p>
<p>And they bring these two systems together in the same place,</p>
<p>in this tectum region, this brainstem, midbrain region.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s all the tongue jutting about when the snakes?</p>
<p>That I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>That may be olfactory.</p>
<p>There may be-</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re sniffing the air with their tongue?</p>
<p>Yeah, there may be a gust of air.</p>
<p>Earlier in our drive,</p>
<p>you told me that flies actually taste things</p>
<p>with their feet.</p>
<p>They do, yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s so weird.</p>
<p>Yeah, they have taste receptors in lots of funny places.</p>
<p>I want to pause here just for one second</p>
<p>before we get back into the midbrain.</p>
<p>I think what&rsquo;s so interesting in all seriousness</p>
<p>about taste receptors on feet, heat sensors,</p>
<p>tongue jutting out of snakes,</p>
<p>and vision and all this integration</p>
<p>is that it really speaks to the fact</p>
<p>that all these sensory neurons</p>
<p>are trying to gather information</p>
<p>and stuff it into a system</p>
<p>that can make meaningful decisions and actions.</p>
<p>And that it really doesn&rsquo;t matter</p>
<p>whether or not it&rsquo;s coming from eyes or ears or nose</p>
<p>or bottoms of feet,</p>
<p>because in the end, it&rsquo;s just electricity flowing in.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>And so it sounds like it&rsquo;s placed on each animal.</p>
<p>It always feels weird to call a fly an animal,</p>
<p>but they are creatures, they are animals.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s placed in different locations on different animals,</p>
<p>depending on the particular needs of that animal.</p>
<p>Right, but how much more powerful</p>
<p>if the nervous systems can also cross-correlate</p>
<p>across sensory systems?</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;ve got a weak signal from one sensory system,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not quite sure there&rsquo;s something there.</p>
<p>And a weak signal from another sensory system</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s telling you the same locations</p>
<p>is a little bit interesting.</p>
<p>There might be something there.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve got those two together, you&rsquo;ve got corroboration.</p>
<p>Your brain now says it&rsquo;s much more likely</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s gonna be something worth paying attention to.</p>
<p>Right, so maybe I&rsquo;m feeling some heat</p>
<p>on one side of my face,</p>
<p>and I also smell something baking in the oven.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So now neither is particularly strong,</p>
<p>but as you said, there&rsquo;s some corroboration.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And that corroboration is occurring in the midbrain.</p>
<p>Right, and then if you throw things into conflict,</p>
<p>now the brain is confused,</p>
<p>and that may be where your motion sickness comes from.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s great to have, as a brain,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s great to have as many sources of information</p>
<p>as you can have, just like if you&rsquo;re a spy or a journalist,</p>
<p>you want as much information as you can get</p>
<p>about what&rsquo;s out there.</p>
<p>But if things conflict, that&rsquo;s problematic, right?</p>
<p>Your sources are giving you different information</p>
<p>about what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>Now you&rsquo;ve got a problem on your hands.</p>
<p>What do you publish?</p>
<p>The midbrain is so fascinating.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna eject us from the midbrain</p>
<p>and go back to the vestibular system,</p>
<p>but I do have a question that I forgot to ask</p>
<p>about the vestibular system, which is,</p>
<p>why is it that for many people, including me,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a, despite my motion sickness in cabs,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a sense of pleasure in moving through space</p>
<p>and getting tilted relative</p>
<p>to the gravitational pull of the earth?</p>
<p>For me growing up, it was skateboarding,</p>
<p>but people like to corner in cars, corner on bikes.</p>
<p>It may be for some people it&rsquo;s done running or dance,</p>
<p>but what is it about moving through space</p>
<p>and getting tilted, a lot of surfers around here,</p>
<p>getting tilted that can tap</p>
<p>into some of the pleasure centers?</p>
<p>Do we have any idea why that would feel good?</p>
<p>I have no clue.</p>
<p>Is there dopaminergic input to this system?</p>
<p>Well, the dopaminergic system gets a lot of places.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty much to some extent everywhere in the cortex,</p>
<p>a lot more in the frontal lobe, of course,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s just for starters.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s basically dopaminergic innervation</p>
<p>in most places in the central nervous system.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s the potential for dopaminergic involvement,</p>
<p>but I really have no clue about the tilting phenomenon.</p>
<p>I mean-</p>
<p>People pay money to go on roller coasters.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Well, I think that may be as much about the thrill</p>
<p>as anything else. Sure.</p>
<p>And falling is, the falling reflex is very robust</p>
<p>in all of us. Right.</p>
<p>When the visual world&rsquo;s going up very fast,</p>
<p>it usually means that we&rsquo;re falling.</p>
<p>Right, right.</p>
<p>And some people like that, some people don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Right, and kids tolerate a lot more</p>
<p>sort of vestibular craziness spinning around</p>
<p>until they drop.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;ve friends, it always worries me a little bit</p>
<p>that they throw their kids.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not recommending anyone do this.</p>
<p>When they&rsquo;re little kids,</p>
<p>like throwing the kids really far back and forth,</p>
<p>some kids seem to love it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, our son loved being shaken up and down</p>
<p>very, very vigorously.</p>
<p>That was the only thing that would calm him down sometimes.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>Yeah, so I&rsquo;m guessing we can guess</p>
<p>that maybe there&rsquo;s some activation of the reward systems</p>
<p>from moving through space.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, if you think about how rewarding it is</p>
<p>to be able to move through space</p>
<p>and how unhappy people are who are used to that</p>
<p>who suddenly aren&rsquo;t able to do that,</p>
<p>there is a sense of agency, right?</p>
<p>If you can choose to move through the world and to tilt,</p>
<p>not only are you moving through the world,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re doing it with a certain amount of finesse.</p>
<p>Maybe that&rsquo;s what it is.</p>
<p>You can feel like you&rsquo;re the master of your own movement</p>
<p>in a way that you wouldn&rsquo;t if you&rsquo;re going straight.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just blowing smoke here, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, well, we can speculate, that&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t help but ask the question.</p>
<p>Okay, so if we move ourselves, pun intended,</p>
<p>back into the midbrain,</p>
<p>the midbrain is combining all these different signals</p>
<p>for reflexive action.</p>
<p>At what point does this become deliberate action?</p>
<p>Because if I look at something I want and I wanna pursue it,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to go toward it.</p>
<p>And many times that&rsquo;s a deliberate decision.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>This gets very slippery, I think,</p>
<p>because what you have to try to imagine</p>
<p>is all these different parts of the brain</p>
<p>working on the problem of staying alive,</p>
<p>and surviving in the world.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re working on the problem simultaneously.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s not one right answer to how to do that.</p>
<p>But one way to think about it is that</p>
<p>you have high levels of your nervous system</p>
<p>that are very well designed to override</p>
<p>an otherwise automatic movement if it&rsquo;s inappropriate.</p>
<p>So if you imagine you&rsquo;ve been invited to tea with the queen,</p>
<p>and she hands you a very fancy Wedgwood teacup, very thin.</p>
<p>Wedgwood teacup?</p>
<p>Yes, with very hot tea in it,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re burning your hand.</p>
<p>You probably will try to find a way</p>
<p>to put that back down on the saucer</p>
<p>rather than just dropping it on the floor,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re with the queen.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re trying to be appropriate to that.</p>
<p>So you have ways of reining in automatic behaviors</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re gonna be maladaptive.</p>
<p>But you also want the reflex to work quickly</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s the only thing that&rsquo;s gonna save you,</p>
<p>the looming object coming at your head.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have time to think about that.</p>
<p>So this is the interplay</p>
<p>in these hierarchically organized centers</p>
<p>of the nervous system.</p>
<p>At the lowest level, you&rsquo;ve got the automatic sensors</p>
<p>and reflex arcs that will keep you safe,</p>
<p>even if you don&rsquo;t have time to think about it.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;ve got the higher center saying,</p>
<p>well, maybe we could do this as well,</p>
<p>or maybe we shouldn&rsquo;t do that at all, right?</p>
<p>So you have all of these different levels</p>
<p>operating simultaneously,</p>
<p>and you need bidirectional communication</p>
<p>between high-level cognitive centers,</p>
<p>decision-making on the one hand,</p>
<p>and these low-level, very helpful reflexive centers,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re a little bit rigid, a little hardwired,</p>
<p>so they need some nuance.</p>
<p>So both of these things are operating in tandem</p>
<p>in real time, all the time in our brains.</p>
<p>And sometimes we listen more to one than the other.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve heard people in sports</p>
<p>talking about messing up at the plate</p>
<p>because they overthought it,</p>
<p>thinking too hard about it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s partly, you&rsquo;ve already trained your cerebellum</p>
<p>how to hit a fastball right down the middle.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And if you start looking for something new or different,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to mess up your reflexive swing.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re trying to think about the physics of the ball</p>
<p>as it&rsquo;s coming at you, you&rsquo;ve already missed, right?</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;re not using your,</p>
<p>all those reps have built a kind of knowledge.</p>
<p>This is what you want to rely on</p>
<p>when you don&rsquo;t have enough time to contemplate.</p>
<p>This is important and a great segue</p>
<p>for what I&rsquo;d like to discuss next,</p>
<p>which is the basal ganglia.</p>
<p>This really interesting area of the brain</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s involved in go type commands and behaviors,</p>
<p>instructing us to do things and no-go,</p>
<p>preventing us from doing things.</p>
<p>Because so much of motor learning and skill execution</p>
<p>and not saying the wrong thing,</p>
<p>or sitting still in class when,</p>
<p>or as you used with the tea with the queen example,</p>
<p>feeling discomfort involves suppressing behavior.</p>
<p>And sometimes it&rsquo;s activating behavior.</p>
<p>Tremendous amount of online attention is devoted</p>
<p>to trying to get people motivated.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t the main focus of our podcast.</p>
<p>We touch on some of the underlying neural circuits</p>
<p>of motivation, dopamine, and so forth.</p>
<p>But so much of what people struggle with out there</p>
<p>are elements around failure to pay attention</p>
<p>or challenges in paying attention,</p>
<p>which is essentially like putting the blinders on,</p>
<p>getting a soda straw view of the world</p>
<p>and maintaining that for a bout of work</p>
<p>or something of that sort and trying to get into action.</p>
<p>So of course, this is carried out by many neural circuits,</p>
<p>not just the basal ganglia,</p>
<p>but what are the basal ganglia</p>
<p>and what are their primary roles</p>
<p>in controlling go type behavior and no-go type behavior?</p>
<p>Yeah, so I mean, the basal ganglia are sitting deep</p>
<p>in what you would call the forebrain.</p>
<p>So the highest levels of the brain,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re sort of cousins to the cerebral cortex,</p>
<p>which we talked about is sort of the highest level</p>
<p>of your brain, the thing you&rsquo;re thinking with.</p>
<p>Cerebral cortex being the refined cousins</p>
<p>and then you&rsquo;ve got the- Right.</p>
<p>You know, the brute. Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s probably totally unfair, but the point-</p>
<p>I like the basal ganglia.</p>
<p>I can relate to the brutish parts of the brain.</p>
<p>Little bit of hypothalamus, little bit of basal ganglia.</p>
<p>Sure. We need it all.</p>
<p>We need it all.</p>
<p>And, you know, this area of the brain</p>
<p>has gotten a lot bigger as the cortex has gotten bigger.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s deeply intertwined with cortical function.</p>
<p>The cortex can&rsquo;t really do what it needs to do</p>
<p>without the help of the basal ganglia and vice versa.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re really intertwined.</p>
<p>And in a way you can think about this logically</p>
<p>as saying, you know, if you have the ability</p>
<p>to withhold behavior or to execute it,</p>
<p>how do you decide which to do?</p>
<p>Well, the cortex is going to have to do</p>
<p>that thinking for you.</p>
<p>You have to be looking at all the contingencies</p>
<p>of your situation to decide, is this a crazy move</p>
<p>or is this a really smart investment right now?</p>
<p>Or, you know, what?</p>
<p>Right, I don&rsquo;t want to go out for a run in the morning,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m going to make myself go out for a run.</p>
<p>Or I&rsquo;m having a great time out on a run</p>
<p>and I know I need to get back,</p>
<p>but I kind of want to go another mile.</p>
<p>I mean, another great example is that, you know,</p>
<p>the marshmallow test for the little kids.</p>
<p>You know, they can get two marshmallows</p>
<p>if they hold off, you know, just 30 seconds initially.</p>
<p>You know, they can have one right away,</p>
<p>but if they can wait 30 seconds, they got two.</p>
<p>You know, so that&rsquo;s the no-go</p>
<p>because their cortex is saying, you know,</p>
<p>I really like to have two more than having one,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re not going to get the two</p>
<p>unless they can not reach for the one.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;ve got to hold off the action.</p>
<p>And that has to result from a cognitive process.</p>
<p>So the cortex is involved in this in a major way.</p>
<p>Yes, I recall in that experiment,</p>
<p>the kids used a variety of tools.</p>
<p>Some would distract themselves.</p>
<p>I particularly related to the kid</p>
<p>that would just put himself right next to the marshmallows</p>
<p>and then some of the kids covered their eyes.</p>
<p>Some of them would count or sing.</p>
<p>Yeah, so that&rsquo;s all very cortical, right?</p>
<p>Coming up with a novel strategy.</p>
<p>Simple example that we&rsquo;re using here,</p>
<p>but of course this is at play anytime someone decides</p>
<p>they want to go watch a motivational speech or something,</p>
<p>just, you know, a Steve Jobs commencement speech</p>
<p>just to get motivated to engage in their day.</p>
<p>Sure, I take this new job.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s got great benefits,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s in a lousy part of the country.</p>
<p>Why do you think that some people have a harder time</p>
<p>running these go, no-go circuits</p>
<p>and other people seem to have very low activation energy,</p>
<p>we would say.</p>
<p>They can just, you know, they have a task,</p>
<p>they just lean into the task.</p>
<p>Whereas some people getting into task completion</p>
<p>or things of that sort is very challenging for them.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, I think it&rsquo;s really just another,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a special case of a very general phenomenon,</p>
<p>which is brains are complicated</p>
<p>and the brains we have</p>
<p>are the result of genetics and experience.</p>
<p>And my genes are different from your genes</p>
<p>and my experiences are different from your experiences.</p>
<p>So the things that would be easy or hard for us</p>
<p>won&rsquo;t necessarily be aligned.</p>
<p>They might just happen to be just because they are,</p>
<p>but the point is that, you know,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re dealt a certain set of cards,</p>
<p>you have certain set of genes,</p>
<p>you are handed, you know, a brain,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t choose your brain, it&rsquo;s handed to you.</p>
<p>But then there&rsquo;s all this stuff you can do with it.</p>
<p>You know, you can learn to, you know,</p>
<p>to have new skills or to act differently</p>
<p>or to show more restraint,</p>
<p>which is kind of relevant to what we&rsquo;re talking about here,</p>
<p>or maybe show less restraint if your problem is</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re so buttoned down, you never have any fun in life</p>
<p>and you should loosen up a little bit, right?</p>
<p>Thank you, I appreciate the insult, yeah.</p>
<p>David&rsquo;s always encouraged me</p>
<p>to have a little more fun in life.</p>
<p>So basal ganglia are,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re kind of the disciplinarian</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;re sort of the instructor or conductor of sorts,</p>
<p>right, go, no go, you know, you be quiet, you start now.</p>
<p>I wish I knew more about the basal ganglia than I do.</p>
<p>My sense is that it, you know,</p>
<p>this system is key for implementing the plans</p>
<p>that get cooked up in the cortex.</p>
<p>But they also influence the plans that the, you know,</p>
<p>cortex is dishing out</p>
<p>because this is a major source of information</p>
<p>to the cortex.</p>
<p>So it becomes almost impossible to figure out</p>
<p>where the computation begins and where it ends</p>
<p>and who&rsquo;s doing what,</p>
<p>because these things are all interacting</p>
<p>in a complex network and it&rsquo;s all of it,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the whole network.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not, you know, one is the leader</p>
<p>and the other is the follower.</p>
<p>Right, of course, yeah, these are,</p>
<p>all the structures that we&rsquo;re discussing</p>
<p>are working in parallel.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a lot of changing crosstalk.</p>
<p>I have this somewhat sick habit, David,</p>
<p>every day I try and do 21 no-go&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>So if I wanna reach for my phone,</p>
<p>I try and not do it</p>
<p>just to see if I can prevent myself</p>
<p>from engaging in that behavior.</p>
<p>If it was reflexive,</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s something I want to do, a deliberate choice,</p>
<p>then I certainly allow myself to do it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t tend to have too much trouble with motivation,</p>
<p>with go-type functions,</p>
<p>mostly because I&rsquo;m so busy that I wish I had more time</p>
<p>for more goes, so to speak.</p>
<p>But do you think these circuits</p>
<p>have genuine plasticity in them?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>I mean, everybody knows how they&rsquo;ve learned over time</p>
<p>to wait for the two marshmallows, right?</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to have instant gratification all the time.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re willing to do a job sometimes</p>
<p>that isn&rsquo;t your favorite job</p>
<p>because it comes with the territory</p>
<p>and you want the salary that comes at the end of the week</p>
<p>or the end of the month, right?</p>
<p>So we can defer gratification.</p>
<p>We can choose not to say the thing</p>
<p>that we know is gonna inflame our partner</p>
<p>and create a meltdown for the next week.</p>
<p>We learn this control,</p>
<p>but I think these are skills like any other.</p>
<p>You can get better at them if you practice them.</p>
<p>So I think you&rsquo;re choosing to do that just spontaneously.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a mental practice.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a discipline.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a way of building a skill that you wanna have.</p>
<p>Yeah, I find it to be something</p>
<p>that when I engage in a no-go-type situation,</p>
<p>then the next time and the next time</p>
<p>that I find myself about to move reflexively,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a little gap in consciousness</p>
<p>that I can make a decision</p>
<p>whether or not this is really the best use of my time.</p>
<p>Because I sometimes wonder</p>
<p>whether or not all this business around attention,</p>
<p>certainly there&rsquo;s the case of ADHD</p>
<p>and clinical diagnosed ADHD,</p>
<p>but all these, the issue around focus and attention</p>
<p>is really that people just have not really learned</p>
<p>how to short-circuit a reflex.</p>
<p>And so much of what makes us different than rattlesnakes</p>
<p>or, well, actually they could be deliberate,</p>
<p>but from the other animals</p>
<p>and is our ability to suppress reflex.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, that&rsquo;s the cortex.</p>
<p>I mean, or let&rsquo;s just say the forebrain,</p>
<p>cortex and basal ganglia working together,</p>
<p>sitting on top of this lizard brain</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s giving you all these great adaptive reflexes</p>
<p>that help you survive.</p>
<p>You just hope you don&rsquo;t get the surprising case</p>
<p>where the thing that your reflex is telling you</p>
<p>is actually exactly the wrong thing</p>
<p>and you make a mistake, right?</p>
<p>Right, so that&rsquo;s what the cortex is for.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s adding nuance and context and experience,</p>
<p>past association, and in human beings,</p>
<p>obviously learning from others through communication.</p>
<p>Well, I was, you went right to it</p>
<p>and it was where I was going to go.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about the cortex.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve worked our way up the so-called neuraxis</p>
<p>as the aficionados will know.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re in the cortex.</p>
<p>This is the seat of our higher consciousness,</p>
<p>self-image, planning and action.</p>
<p>But as you mentioned, the cortex isn&rsquo;t just about that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s got other regions that are involved in other things.</p>
<p>So maybe we should, staying with vision,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s talk a little bit about visual cortex.</p>
<p>You told me a story, an amazing story about visual cortex.</p>
<p>And it was a somewhat of a sad story, unfortunately,</p>
<p>about someone who had a stroke to visual cortex.</p>
<p>Maybe if you would share that story,</p>
<p>because I think it illustrates many important principles</p>
<p>about what the cortex does.</p>
<p>Right, so the visual cortex is,</p>
<p>you could say the projection screen,</p>
<p>the first place where this information</p>
<p>streaming from the retina through this thalamus,</p>
<p>connecting linker, gets played out</p>
<p>for the highest level of your brain to see.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s a representation,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a map of things going on in the visual world</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s in your brain.</p>
<p>And when we describe a scene to a friend,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re using this chunk of our brain</p>
<p>to be able to put words,</p>
<p>which are coming from a different part of our cortex,</p>
<p>to the objects and movements and colors</p>
<p>that we see in the world.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a key part of your visual experience</p>
<p>when you can describe the things you&rsquo;re seeing,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re looking at your visual cortex.</p>
<p>And this is-</p>
<p>Could I just ask a quick question?</p>
<p>So right now, because I&rsquo;m looking at your face,</p>
<p>as we&rsquo;re talking, there are neurons in my brain,</p>
<p>more or less in the configuration of your face</p>
<p>that are active as you move about.</p>
<p>And what if I were to close my eyes and just imagine,</p>
<p>I do this all the time, by the way, David,</p>
<p>I close my eyes and I imagine David Bersin&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t tend to do that as often, maybe I should,</p>
<p>but you get the point.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m now using visualization of what you look like</p>
<p>by way of memory.</p>
<p>If we were to image the neurons in my brain,</p>
<p>would the activity of neurons resemble</p>
<p>the activity of neurons that&rsquo;s present</p>
<p>when I open my eyes and look at your actual face?</p>
<p>This is a deep question.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t really have a full accounting yet.</p>
<p>Yes, except you&rsquo;re talking about looking in detail</p>
<p>at the activity of neurons in a human brain,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s not as easy to do as it would be</p>
<p>in some kind of animal model.</p>
<p>But the bottom line is that you have a spatial representation</p>
<p>of the visual world laid as a map of the visual world</p>
<p>laid out on the surface of your cortex.</p>
<p>The thing that&rsquo;s surprising is that it&rsquo;s not one map,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s actually dozens of maps.</p>
<p>What do each of those maps do?</p>
<p>Well, we don&rsquo;t really have a full accounting there either,</p>
<p>but it looks a little bit like the diversification</p>
<p>of the output neurons of the retina,</p>
<p>the ganglion cells we were talking about before.</p>
<p>There are different types of ganglion cells</p>
<p>that are encoding different kinds of information</p>
<p>about the visual world.</p>
<p>We talk about the ones that were encoding the brightness,</p>
<p>but are the ones that are encoding motion or color,</p>
<p>these kinds of things.</p>
<p>The same kinds of specializations</p>
<p>in different representations of the visual world</p>
<p>in the cortex seem to be true.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a complex story.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have the whole picture yet,</p>
<p>but it does look as if some parts of the brain</p>
<p>are much more important for things like reaching for things</p>
<p>in the space around you,</p>
<p>and other parts of the cortex are really important</p>
<p>for making associations between particular visual things</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re looking at now and their significance.</p>
<p>What is that object?</p>
<p>What can it do for me?</p>
<p>How can I use it?</p>
<p>What about the really specialized areas of cortex,</p>
<p>like neurons that respond to particular faces,</p>
<p>or neurons that, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>can help me understand where I am</p>
<p>relative to some other specific object?</p>
<p>Right, so these are properties of neurons</p>
<p>that are extracted from,</p>
<p>detected by recording the activity of single neurons</p>
<p>in some experimental system.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s going on when you actually perceive</p>
<p>your grandmother&rsquo;s face is a much more complicated question.</p>
<p>It clearly involves hundreds and thousands</p>
<p>and probably millions of neurons</p>
<p>acting in a cooperative way.</p>
<p>So you can pick out any one little element</p>
<p>in this very complicated system</p>
<p>and see that it&rsquo;s responding differentially</p>
<p>to certain kinds of visual patterns,</p>
<p>and you think you&rsquo;re seeing a glimpse</p>
<p>of some part of the process</p>
<p>by which you recognize your grandmother&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s a long way from a complete description,</p>
<p>and it certainly isn&rsquo;t gonna be at the level</p>
<p>of a magic single neuron that has the special stuff</p>
<p>to recognize your grandmother.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna be in some pattern of activity</p>
<p>across many, many cells,</p>
<p>resonating in some kind of special way</p>
<p>that will represent the internal memory of your mother.</p>
<p>Which is really incredible.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, every time we do this deep dive,</p>
<p>which we do from time to time, you and I,</p>
<p>we kind of like march into the nervous system</p>
<p>and explore how different aspects</p>
<p>of our life experiences is handled there</p>
<p>and how it&rsquo;s organized.</p>
<p>It, after so many decades of doing this,</p>
<p>it still boggles my mind</p>
<p>that the collection of neurons one through seven</p>
<p>active in a particular sequence</p>
<p>gives the memory of a particular face</p>
<p>and run backwards seven to one,</p>
<p>it gives you a complete, you know,</p>
<p>it could be, you know, rattlesnake,</p>
<p>pit viper, heat-sensing organs,</p>
<p>as we were talking about earlier.</p>
<p>So it sounds, is it true that there&rsquo;s a lot</p>
<p>of multi-purposing of the circuitry?</p>
<p>Like we can&rsquo;t say one area of the brain does A</p>
<p>and another area of the brain does B.</p>
<p>So, you know, areas can multitask or have multiple jobs.</p>
<p>They can moonlight.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>But I think in my career,</p>
<p>the hard problem has been to square that</p>
<p>with the fact that, you know, things are specialized,</p>
<p>that there are specific genes expressed in specific neurons</p>
<p>that make them make synaptic connections</p>
<p>with only certain other neurons.</p>
<p>And that particular synaptic arrangement</p>
<p>actually results in the processing of information</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s useful to the animal to survive, right?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not as if it&rsquo;s either a big,</p>
<p>undifferentiated network of cells</p>
<p>and looking at any one is never gonna tell you anything.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s too extreme on the one hand,</p>
<p>nor is it the case that everything is hardwired</p>
<p>and every neuron has one function</p>
<p>and this all happens in one place in the brain.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s way more complicated and interactive</p>
<p>and interconnected than that.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re not hardwired or softwired.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s both.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re sort of, I don&rsquo;t know what the analogy should be.</p>
<p>What substance would work best, David?</p>
<p>No idea there, but you know,</p>
<p>the idea is that it&rsquo;s always network activity.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s always many, many neurons involved,</p>
<p>and yet there&rsquo;s tremendous specificity</p>
<p>in the neurons that might or might not be participating</p>
<p>in any distributed function like that, right?</p>
<p>So you have to get your mind around the fact</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s both very specific</p>
<p>and very nonspecific at the same time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little tricky to do,</p>
<p>but I think that&rsquo;s kind of where the truth lies.</p>
<p>Yeah, and so this example that you mentioned to me</p>
<p>once before about a woman who had a stroke in visual cortex</p>
<p>I think speaks to some of this.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Could you share with us that story?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>The point is that you all, those of us who see,</p>
<p>have representations of the visual world</p>
<p>in our visual cortex.</p>
<p>What happens to somebody when they become blind</p>
<p>because of problems in the eye, the retina perhaps?</p>
<p>You have a big chunk of the cortex,</p>
<p>this really valuable real estate for neural processing</p>
<p>that has come to expect input from the visual system,</p>
<p>and there isn&rsquo;t any anymore.</p>
<p>So you might think about that as fallow land, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s unused by the nervous system,</p>
<p>and that would be a pity,</p>
<p>but it turns out that it is in fact used.</p>
<p>And the case that you&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>is of a woman who was blind from very early in her life</p>
<p>and who had risen through the ranks</p>
<p>to a very high level executive secretarial position</p>
<p>in a major corporation.</p>
<p>And she was extremely good at braille reading,</p>
<p>and she had a braille typewriter,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s how everything was done.</p>
<p>And apparently she had a stroke</p>
<p>and was discovered at work, collapsed,</p>
<p>and they brought her to the hospital.</p>
<p>And apparently the neurologist who saw her</p>
<p>when she finally came to said,</p>
<p>you know, I&rsquo;ve got good news and bad news.</p>
<p>Bad news is you&rsquo;ve had a stroke.</p>
<p>The good news is that it was in an area of your brain</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not even using.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s your visual cortex,</p>
<p>and I know you&rsquo;re blind from birth,</p>
<p>so there shouldn&rsquo;t be any issue here.</p>
<p>The problem was she lost her ability to read braille.</p>
<p>So what appears to have been the case,</p>
<p>and this has been confirmed in other ways</p>
<p>by imaging experiments in humans,</p>
<p>is that in people who are blind from very early in birth,</p>
<p>the visual cortex gets repurposed</p>
<p>as a center for processing tactile information.</p>
<p>And especially if you train to be a good braille reader,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re actually reallocating somehow</p>
<p>that real estate to your fingertips,</p>
<p>you know, a part of the cortex</p>
<p>that should be listening to the eyes.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s an extreme level of plasticity,</p>
<p>but what it shows is the visual cortex</p>
<p>is kind of a general purpose processing machine.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s good at spatial information,</p>
<p>and the skin of your fingers is just another spatial sense</p>
<p>and deprived of any other input.</p>
<p>The brain seems smart enough, if you wanna put it that way,</p>
<p>to rewire itself to use that real estate</p>
<p>for something useful, in this case, reading braille.</p>
<p>Incredible.</p>
<p>Somewhat tragic, but incredible.</p>
<p>At least in that case, tragic.</p>
<p>Very informative.</p>
<p>Very informative.</p>
<p>And of course it can go the other way too,</p>
<p>where people can gain function in particular modalities,</p>
<p>like improved hearing or tactile function</p>
<p>in the absence of vision.</p>
<p>Tell us about connectomes.</p>
<p>We hear about genomes, proteomes, microbiomes,</p>
<p>ohms, ohms, ohms these days.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s a connectome and why is it valuable?</p>
<p>Yeah, so connectome actually now has two meanings.</p>
<p>So I only refer to the one that is my passion right now,</p>
<p>and that is really trying to understand</p>
<p>the structure of nervous tissue</p>
<p>at a scale that&rsquo;s very, very fine.</p>
<p>Smaller than a millimeter.</p>
<p>Way smaller than a millimeter, a nanometer or less.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a thousand times smaller,</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s actually a million times smaller.</p>
<p>So really, really tiny.</p>
<p>On the scale of individual synapses</p>
<p>between individual neurons, or even smaller,</p>
<p>like the individual synaptic vesicles</p>
<p>containing little packets of neurotransmitter</p>
<p>that are gonna get it released</p>
<p>to allow one neuron to communicate to the next.</p>
<p>So very, very fine.</p>
<p>But the notion here is that you&rsquo;re doing this</p>
<p>section after section at very fine scale.</p>
<p>So in theory, what you have is a complete description</p>
<p>of a chunk of nervous tissue that is so complete</p>
<p>that if you took enough time to identify</p>
<p>where the boundaries of all the cells are,</p>
<p>you could come up with a complete description</p>
<p>of the synaptic wiring of that chunk of nervous tissue,</p>
<p>because you have a complete description</p>
<p>of where all the cells are and where all the synapses</p>
<p>are where all the cells are.</p>
<p>So now you essentially have a wiring diagram</p>
<p>of this complicated piece of tissue.</p>
<p>So the omics part is the exhaustiveness of it,</p>
<p>rather than looking at a couple of synapses</p>
<p>that are interesting to you from two different cell types,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re looking at all the synapses of all of the cell types,</p>
<p>which of course is this massive avalanche of data, right?</p>
<p>So in genetics, you have genetics,</p>
<p>and then you have genomics,</p>
<p>which is the idea of getting the whole genome.</p>
<p>All of it.</p>
<p>And we don&rsquo;t really have an analogous word for genetics,</p>
<p>but it would be connectivity and conomics.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Excuse me, conectomics.</p>
<p>Conectomics, sure, sure.</p>
<p>Connectivity and conectomics.</p>
<p>Right, so it&rsquo;s wanting it all.</p>
<p>And of course it&rsquo;s crazy ambitious,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s where it gets fun.</p>
<p>Really, it&rsquo;s a use of electron microscopy,</p>
<p>a very high resolution, microscopic imaging system</p>
<p>on a new scale with way more payoff</p>
<p>in terms of understanding the connectivity</p>
<p>of the nervous system.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just emerging,</p>
<p>but I really think it&rsquo;s gonna revolutionize the field</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re gonna be able to query these circuits.</p>
<p>How did they actually do it?</p>
<p>Look at the hardware</p>
<p>in a way that&rsquo;s never been possible before.</p>
<p>The way that I describe this to people is</p>
<p>if you were to take a chunk of kind of cold,</p>
<p>cooked, but cold spaghetti.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And slice it up very thin,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re trying to connect up each image of each slice</p>
<p>of the edge of the spaghetti</p>
<p>as figure out which ropes of spaghetti belong to which.</p>
<p>And have a complete description</p>
<p>of where this piece of spaghetti</p>
<p>touches that piece of spaghetti,</p>
<p>and is there something special there?</p>
<p>Obviously.</p>
<p>Where the meat sauce is and all the other cell types</p>
<p>and the pesto, where it all is around the spaghetti.</p>
<p>Because those are the other cells,</p>
<p>the blood vessels and the glial cells.</p>
<p>And so what&rsquo;s it good for?</p>
<p>I mean, maps are great.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I always think of connectomics and genomics</p>
<p>and proteomics, et cetera,</p>
<p>as necessary but not sufficient.</p>
<p>Right, right.</p>
<p>So, I mean, in many cases what you do</p>
<p>is you go out and probe the function</p>
<p>and you understand how the brain does the function</p>
<p>by finding neurons that seem to be firing</p>
<p>in association with this function that you&rsquo;re observing.</p>
<p>And little by little, you work your way in</p>
<p>and now you want to know what the connectivity is.</p>
<p>Maybe the anatomy could help you.</p>
<p>But this connectomics approach,</p>
<p>or at least the serial electron microscopy</p>
<p>reconstruction of neurons approach,</p>
<p>really is allowing us to frame questions</p>
<p>starting from the anatomy</p>
<p>and saying, I see a synaptic circuit here.</p>
<p>My prediction would be that these cell types</p>
<p>would interact in a particular way.</p>
<p>Is that right?</p>
<p>And then you can go and probe the physiology</p>
<p>and you might be right or you might be wrong.</p>
<p>But more often than not,</p>
<p>it looks like the structure is pointing us</p>
<p>in the right direction.</p>
<p>So in my case, I&rsquo;m using this to try to understand</p>
<p>the circuit that is involved</p>
<p>in this image stabilization network we&rsquo;re talking about,</p>
<p>keeping things stable on the retina.</p>
<p>And this thing will only respond</p>
<p>at certain speeds of motion.</p>
<p>These cells in the circuit,</p>
<p>like slow motion, they won&rsquo;t respond to fast motion.</p>
<p>How does that come about?</p>
<p>Well, I was able to probe the circuitry.</p>
<p>I knew what my cells looked like.</p>
<p>I could see which other cells were talking to it.</p>
<p>I could categorize all the cells</p>
<p>that might be the players here</p>
<p>that are involved in this mechanism</p>
<p>of tuning the thing for slow speeds.</p>
<p>And then we said, it looks like it&rsquo;s that cell type.</p>
<p>And we went and looked and the data bore that up.</p>
<p>But the anatomy drove the search</p>
<p>for the particular cell type</p>
<p>because we could see it connected</p>
<p>in the right place to the right cells.</p>
<p>So that creates the hypothesis</p>
<p>that lets you go query the physiology,</p>
<p>but it can go the other way as well.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s always the synergy</p>
<p>between these functional and structural approaches</p>
<p>that gives you the most lift.</p>
<p>But in many cases,</p>
<p>the anatomy has been a little bit the weak sister in this,</p>
<p>the structure, trying to work out the diagram</p>
<p>because we haven&rsquo;t had the methods.</p>
<p>Now the methods exist.</p>
<p>And this whole field is expanding very quickly</p>
<p>because people want these circuit diagrams</p>
<p>for the particular part of the nervous system</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re working on.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t know the cell types and the connections,</p>
<p>how do you really understand how the machine works?</p>
<p>Yeah, what I love about it is</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t know what we don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Scientists, we don&rsquo;t ask questions, we pose hypotheses.</p>
<p>Hypotheses being, of course,</p>
<p>some prediction that you wager your time on, basically.</p>
<p>And it either turns out to be true or not true.</p>
<p>But if you don&rsquo;t know that a particular cell type is there,</p>
<p>you could never, in any configuration of life</p>
<p>or a career or exploration of a nervous system,</p>
<p>wager a hypothesis because you didn&rsquo;t know it was there.</p>
<p>So this allows you to say,</p>
<p>ah, there&rsquo;s a little interesting little connection</p>
<p>between this cell that I know is interesting</p>
<p>and another cell that&rsquo;s a little mysterious but interesting.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to hypothesize that it&rsquo;s doing</p>
<p>blank, blank, and blank and go test that.</p>
<p>And in the absence of these connectomes,</p>
<p>you would never know that that cell</p>
<p>was lurking there in the shadows.</p>
<p>Right, right.</p>
<p>Yeah, and if you&rsquo;re just trying to understand</p>
<p>how information flows through this biological machine,</p>
<p>you want to know where things are.</p>
<p>Neurotransmitters are dumped out of the terminals</p>
<p>of one cell and they diffuse across the space</p>
<p>between the two cells, which is kind of a liquidy space,</p>
<p>and they hit some receptors on the postsynaptic cell</p>
<p>and they have some impact.</p>
<p>Sometimes that&rsquo;s not through a regular synapse.</p>
<p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s through a neuromodulator,</p>
<p>like you often talk about on your podcast,</p>
<p>that are sort of oozing-</p>
<p>Dopamine or something.</p>
<p>Dopamine, exactly.</p>
<p>Oozing into the space between the cells</p>
<p>and it may be acting at some distance</p>
<p>far from where it was released, right?</p>
<p>But if you don&rsquo;t know where the release is happening</p>
<p>and where other things are that might respond</p>
<p>to that release, you&rsquo;re groping around in the dark.</p>
<p>Well, I love that you are doing this.</p>
<p>And I have to share with the listeners</p>
<p>that the first time I ever met David,</p>
<p>and every time I&rsquo;ve ever met with him in person,</p>
<p>at least at his laboratory at Brown,</p>
<p>he was in his office, door closed,</p>
<p>drawing neurons and their connections.</p>
<p>And this is somewhat unusual for somebody</p>
<p>who is a endowed full professor,</p>
<p>chairman of the department, et cetera, for many years,</p>
<p>to be doing the hands-on work.</p>
<p>Typically, that&rsquo;s the stuff that&rsquo;s done by technicians</p>
<p>or graduate students or postdocs.</p>
<p>But I think it&rsquo;s fair to say that you really love</p>
<p>looking at nervous systems</p>
<p>and drawing the accurate renditions</p>
<p>of how those nervous systems are organized</p>
<p>and thinking about how they work.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s pure joy for me.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m a very visual person.</p>
<p>My wife is an artist.</p>
<p>We look at a lot of art together.</p>
<p>Just the forms of things are gorgeous in their own right.</p>
<p>But to know that the form is, in a sense, the function,</p>
<p>that the architecture of the connectivity</p>
<p>is how the computation happens in the brain at some level,</p>
<p>even though we don&rsquo;t fully understand that in most contexts,</p>
<p>gives me great joy,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m working on something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s both visually beautiful,</p>
<p>but also deeply beautiful</p>
<p>in a higher knowledge context.</p>
<p>What is it all about?</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>Well, as a final question,</p>
<p>I get asked very often</p>
<p>about how people should learn about neuroscience</p>
<p>or how they should go about pursuing</p>
<p>maybe an education in neuroscience</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re at that stage of their life</p>
<p>or that&rsquo;s appropriate for their current trajectory.</p>
<p>Do you have any advice to young people, old people,</p>
<p>anything in between</p>
<p>about how to learn about the nervous system,</p>
<p>maybe in a more formal way?</p>
<p>I mean, obviously, we have our podcast.</p>
<p>There are other sources</p>
<p>of neuroscience information out there,</p>
<p>but for the young person</p>
<p>who thinks they want to understand the brain,</p>
<p>they want to learn about the brain,</p>
<p>what should we tell them?</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s a great question,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s so many sources out there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost a question of how do you deal</p>
<p>with this avalanche of information out there?</p>
<p>I mean, I think our podcast is a great way</p>
<p>for people to learn more about the nervous system</p>
<p>in an accessible way,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s so much stuff out there,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not just that.</p>
<p>I mean, the resources are becoming more and more available</p>
<p>for average folks to participate</p>
<p>in neuroscience research on some level.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s this famous eye wire project of Sebastian Mazzone.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, tell us about eye wire.</p>
<p>Yeah, so that&rsquo;s connectomics,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s a situation where a very clever scientist</p>
<p>realized that the physical work</p>
<p>of doing all this reconstruction of neurons</p>
<p>from these electron micrographs,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of time involved.</p>
<p>Many, many person hours have to go into that</p>
<p>to come up with the map that you want</p>
<p>of where the cells are,</p>
<p>and he was very clever about setting up a context</p>
<p>in which he could crowdsource this,</p>
<p>and people who were interested</p>
<p>in getting a little experience looking at nervous tissue</p>
<p>and participating in a research project</p>
<p>could learn how to do this and do a little bit.</p>
<p>From their living room.</p>
<p>From their living room.</p>
<p>So people will put a link to eye wire.</p>
<p>It also is a great bridge</p>
<p>between what we were just talking about, connectomics,</p>
<p>and actually participating in research,</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t need a graduate mentor or anything like that.</p>
<p>Right, so more of this is coming,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m actually interested in building more of this</p>
<p>so that people who are interested,</p>
<p>want to participate at some level,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t necessarily have the time or resources</p>
<p>to get involved in laboratory research,</p>
<p>can get exposed to it and participate</p>
<p>and actually contribute.</p>
<p>So I think that&rsquo;s one thing.</p>
<p>I mean, just asking questions of the people around you</p>
<p>who know a little bit more</p>
<p>and have them point you in the right direction.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a book you might like to read.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s lots of great popular books out there</p>
<p>that are accessible that will give you some more sense</p>
<p>of the full range of what&rsquo;s out there in the neurosciences.</p>
<p>We can put some links to a few of those that we like</p>
<p>on basic neuroscience.</p>
<p>Our good friend Dick Masland,</p>
<p>the late Richard, people will call him Dick,</p>
<p>Dick Masland, had a good book.</p>
<p>I forget the title at the moment.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sitting behind me somewhere over there on the shelf,</p>
<p>but about vision and how nervous systems work.</p>
<p>A pretty accessible book for the general public.</p>
<p>Right, right.</p>
<p>So that, and there&rsquo;s so many sources out there.</p>
<p>I mean, Wikipedia is a great way.</p>
<p>If you had a particular question about visual function,</p>
<p>I would say, by all means,</p>
<p>head to Wikipedia and get the first look</p>
<p>and follow the references from there,</p>
<p>or go to your library or, you know,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so many ways to get into it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s such an exciting field now.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so many, I mean, any particular realm</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s special to you, your experience,</p>
<p>your, you know, your strengths, your passions,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a field of neuroscience devoted to that.</p>
<p>You know, if you&rsquo;ve got, if you know somebody</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s got a neurological problem or a psychiatric problem,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a branch of neuroscience that is devoted</p>
<p>to trying to understand that</p>
<p>and to solve these kinds of problems down the line.</p>
<p>So feel the, feel the buzz.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an exciting time to get involved.</p>
<p>Great, those are great resources</p>
<p>that people can access from anywhere, zero cost,</p>
<p>as you need an internet connection.</p>
<p>But aside from that, we&rsquo;ll put the links to some,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m remembering Dick&rsquo;s book is called</p>
<p>We Know It When We See It.</p>
<p>Right, one of my heroes.</p>
<p>Yeah, a wonderful colleague</p>
<p>who unfortunately we lost a few years ago.</p>
<p>But listen, David, this has been wonderful.</p>
<p>We really appreciate you taking the time to do this.</p>
<p>As people probably realize by now,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re an incredible wealth of knowledge</p>
<p>about the entire nervous system.</p>
<p>Today, we just hit this top contour</p>
<p>of a number of different areas to give a flavor</p>
<p>of the different ways that the nervous system works</p>
<p>and is organized and how that&rsquo;s put together,</p>
<p>how these areas are talking to one another.</p>
<p>What I love about you</p>
<p>is that you&rsquo;re such an incredible educator</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve taught so many students over the years,</p>
<p>but also for me personally as friends,</p>
<p>but also anytime that I want to touch</p>
<p>into the beauty of the nervous system,</p>
<p>I rarely lose touch with it,</p>
<p>but anytime I want to touch into it</p>
<p>and start thinking about new problems</p>
<p>and ways that the nervous system is doing things</p>
<p>that I hadn&rsquo;t thought about, I call you.</p>
<p>So please forgive me for the calls past, present,</p>
<p>and future, unless you change your number.</p>
<p>And even if you do, I&rsquo;ll be calling.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been such a blast, Andy.</p>
<p>This has been a great session</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s always fun talking to you.</p>
<p>It always gets my brain racing.</p>
<p>So thank you.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Thank you for joining me today</p>
<p>for my discussion with Dr. David Bersin.</p>
<p>By now, you should have a much clearer understanding</p>
<p>of how the brain is organized and how it works</p>
<p>to do all the incredible things that it does.</p>
