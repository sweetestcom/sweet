    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>The following is a conversation with Natalia Bailey,</p>
<p>a rocket scientist and spacecraft propulsion engineer</p>
<p>previously at MIT and now the founder and CTO</p>
<p>of Axion Systems,</p>
<p>specializing in efficient space propulsion engines</p>
<p>for satellites and spacecraft.</p>
<p>So these are not the engines that get us</p>
<p>from the ground on Earth out to space,</p>
<p>but rather the engines that move us around in space</p>
<p>once we get out there.</p>
<p>Quick mention of our sponsors,</p>
<p>Monk Pack Low Carb Snacks,</p>
<p>Four Sigmatic Mushroom Coffee,</p>
<p>Blinkist, an app that summarizes books,</p>
<p>and Sun Basket, meal delivery service.</p>
<p>So the choice is snacks, caffeine,</p>
<p>knowledge, or a delicious meal.</p>
<p>Choose wisely, my friends,</p>
<p>and if you wish, click the sponsor links below</p>
<p>to get a discount and to support this podcast.</p>
<p>As a side note, let me say something about Natalia&rsquo;s story.</p>
<p>She has talked about how when she was young,</p>
<p>she would often look up at the stars</p>
<p>and dream of alien intelligences</p>
<p>that one day we could communicate with.</p>
<p>This moment of childlike cosmic curiosity</p>
<p>is at the core of my own interest in space</p>
<p>and extraterrestrial life and in general</p>
<p>in artificial intelligence, science, and engineering.</p>
<p>Amid the meetings and the papers and the career rat race</p>
<p>and all the awards,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s not let ourselves lose that childlike wonder.</p>
<p>Sadly, we&rsquo;re on Earth for only a very short time,</p>
<p>so let&rsquo;s have fun solving some of the biggest puzzles</p>
<p>in the universe while we&rsquo;re here.</p>

<p>And now, here&rsquo;s my conversation with Natalia Bailey.</p>
<p>You said that you spent your whole life dreaming about space</p>
<p>and also pondering the big existential question</p>
<p>of whether there is or isn&rsquo;t intelligent life,</p>
<p>intelligent alien civilizations out there.</p>
<p>So what do you think?</p>
<p>Do you think there&rsquo;s life out there?</p>
<p>Intelligent life?</p>
<p>Intelligent life, that&rsquo;s trickier.</p>
<p>I think looking at the likelihood</p>
<p>of a self replicating organism</p>
<p>given how much time the universe has existed</p>
<p>and how many stars with planets,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s likely that there&rsquo;s other life.</p>
<p>Intelligent life, I&rsquo;m hopeful,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a little discouraged that we haven&rsquo;t yet been in touch.</p>
<p>As I&rsquo;m hopeful.</p>
<p>Allegedly, I mean, it&rsquo;s also.</p>
<p>In our dimensions and so on, yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also possible that they have been in touch</p>
<p>and we just haven&rsquo;t, we&rsquo;re too dumb to realize</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re communicating with us.</p>
<p>In whichever, it&rsquo;s the Carl Sagan idea</p>
<p>that they may be communicating at a time scale</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s totally different.</p>
<p>Like their signals are in a totally different time scale</p>
<p>or in a totally different kind of medium of communication.</p>
<p>It could be our own, it could be the birth of human beings.</p>
<p>Whatever the magic that makes us who we are,</p>
<p>the collective intelligence thing,</p>
<p>that could be aliens themselves.</p>
<p>That could be the medium of communication.</p>
<p>Like the nature of our consciousness</p>
<p>and intelligence itself is the medium of communication.</p>
<p>And like being able to ask the questions themselves,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never thought of it that way.</p>
<p>Like actually, yeah, asking the question</p>
<p>whether aliens exist might be the very medium</p>
<p>by which they communicate.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like they send questions.</p>
<p>So some of this like collective emergent behavior</p>
<p>is the signal.</p>
<p>Is the signal, yeah.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s interesting, yeah.</p>
<p>Because maybe that&rsquo;s how we would communicate with,</p>
<p>if you think about it, if we were way, way, way smarter,</p>
<p>like a thousand years from now, we somehow survive,</p>
<p>like how would we actually communicate?</p>
<p>In a way that&rsquo;s like, if we broadcast the signal,</p>
<p>and then it could somehow like percolate</p>
<p>throughout the universe,</p>
<p>like that signal having an impact on.</p>
<p>Multiverse.</p>
<p>Multiverse, of course, that would have a signal,</p>
<p>an effect on the most possible,</p>
<p>the highest number of possible civilizations.</p>
<p>What would that signal be?</p>
<p>It might not be like sending a few</p>
<p>like stupid little hello world messages.</p>
<p>It might be something more impactful.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like impactful in a way</p>
<p>where they don&rsquo;t have to have the capability to hear it.</p>
<p>It like forces the message to have an impact.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>My train of thought has never gone there,</p>
<p>but I like it.</p>
<p>And also somewhere in there,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s implied that something travels faster</p>
<p>than the speed of light, which I&rsquo;m also really hopeful for.</p>
<p>Oh, you&rsquo;re hopeful.</p>
<p>Are you excited by the possibility</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s intelligent life out there?</p>
<p>Sort of, you work on the engineering side of things.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s this very kind of focused pursuit</p>
<p>of moving things through space efficiently.</p>
<p>But if you zoom out,</p>
<p>one of the cool things that this enables us to do is find,</p>
<p>get even intelligent life,</p>
<p>just life on Mars or on Europa or something like that.</p>
<p>Does that excite you?</p>
<p>Does that scare you?</p>
<p>Oh, it&rsquo;s very exciting.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s the whole reason I went into the field</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in is to contribute to building the body of knowledge</p>
<p>that we have as a species.</p>
<p>So very exciting.</p>
<p>Do you think there&rsquo;s life on Mars?</p>
<p>Like no longer, well, already living,</p>
<p>but currently living, but also no longer living,</p>
<p>like that we might be able to find life,</p>
<p>as some people suspect, basic microbial life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not so sure about in our own solar system.</p>
<p>And I do think it might be hard to untangle</p>
<p>if we somehow contaminated other things as well.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not sure about this close to home.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;d be really exciting.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Do you think about the Drake equation much of like?</p>
<p>That was what got me into all of this, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, because one of the questions is how hard is it</p>
<p>for life to start on a habitable planet?</p>
<p>Like if you have a lot of the basic conditions,</p>
<p>not exactly like Earth, but basic Earth like conditions,</p>
<p>how hard is it for life to start?</p>
<p>And if you find life on Mars or find life on Europa,</p>
<p>that means it&rsquo;s way easier.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good thing to confirm</p>
<p>that if you have a habitable planet,</p>
<p>then there&rsquo;s going to be life.</p>
<p>And that like immediately, that would be super exciting</p>
<p>because that means there&rsquo;s like trillions of planets</p>
<p>with basic life out there.</p>
<p>Though of all the planets in our solar system,</p>
<p>Earth is clearly the most habitable.</p>
<p>So I would not be discouraged</p>
<p>if we didn&rsquo;t find it on another planet in our solar system.</p>
<p>True, and again, that life could look very different.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s habitable for Earth like life,</p>
<p>but it could be totally different.</p>
<p>I still think that trees are quite possibly</p>
<p>more intelligent than humans,</p>
<p>but their intelligence is carried out over a time scale</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re just not able to appreciate.</p>
<p>Like they might be running</p>
<p>the entirety of human civilization,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re just like too dumb to realize</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re the smart ones.</p>
<p>Maybe that&rsquo;s the alien message.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s in the trees.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s not in the monolith in the Utah desert.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s in the trees.</p>
<p>Right, yeah.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s go to space exploration.</p>
<p>How do you think we would get humans to Mars?</p>
<p>I think SpaceX and Elon Musk will be the ones</p>
<p>that get the first human setting foot on Mars,</p>
<p>and probably not that long from now</p>
<p>from us having this conversation.</p>
<p>Maybe we&rsquo;ll inflate his timeline a little bit,</p>
<p>but I tend to believe the goals he sets.</p>
<p>So I think that will happen relatively soon.</p>
<p>As far as when and what it will take</p>
<p>to get humans living there in a more permanent way,</p>
<p>I have a glib answer, which is when we can invent</p>
<p>a time machine to go back to the early Cold War,</p>
<p>and instead of uniting around sending people to the moon,</p>
<p>we pick Mars as the destination.</p>
<p>So really, I say that because there&rsquo;s nothing</p>
<p>truly scientifically or technologically impossible</p>
<p>about doing that soon.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more politically and financially,</p>
<p>and those are the obstacles, I think, to that.</p>
<p>Well, I wonder of when you colonize</p>
<p>with more than, I say, five people on Mars,</p>
<p>you have to start thinking about the kind of rules</p>
<p>you have on Mars, and just speaking of the Cold War,</p>
<p>who gets to own the land?</p>
<p>You know, you start planting flags,</p>
<p>and you start to make decisions.</p>
<p>And like SpaceX says, it&rsquo;s probably a little bit trolly,</p>
<p>but they have this nice paragraph in their contracts</p>
<p>where it talks about that human governments on Earth</p>
<p>or Earth governments have no jurisdiction on Mars.</p>
<p>Like the rules, the Martians get to define their own rules.</p>
<p>It sounds very much like the founding fathers</p>
<p>for this country.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the kind of language.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting that that&rsquo;s in there,</p>
<p>and it makes you think perhaps that needs to be leveraged.</p>
<p>Like you have to be very clever about leveraging that</p>
<p>to create a little bit of a Cold War feeling.</p>
<p>It seems like we humans need a little bit of a competition.</p>
<p>Do you think that&rsquo;s necessary to succeed</p>
<p>and to get the necessary investment,</p>
<p>or can the pure pursuit of science be enough?</p>
<p>No, I think we&rsquo;re seeing right now</p>
<p>the pure pursuit of science.</p>
<p>I mean, that results in pretty tiny budgets for exploration.</p>
<p>There has to be some disaster impending doom</p>
<p>to get us onto another planet in a permanent way.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, financially, I just don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>if the private sector can support that,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t wish that there is some catastrophe</p>
<p>coming our way that spurs us to do that.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m unsure what the business model is</p>
<p>for colonizing Mars.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>Yeah, like there is for, we&rsquo;ll talk about satellites.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s probably a lot of business models around satellites,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s not enough short term business.</p>
<p>I guess that&rsquo;s how business works.</p>
<p>Like you should have a path to making money</p>
<p>in like the next 10 years.</p>
<p>Well, and maybe even more broadly,</p>
<p>and looping back to something we said earlier,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know that getting humans off this planet</p>
<p>and spreading like bacteria</p>
<p>is what we&rsquo;re supposed to be doing in the first place.</p>
<p>So maybe we can go, but should we?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m probably an unusual person</p>
<p>for thinking that in my industry</p>
<p>because humans want to explore,</p>
<p>but I almost wonder, are we putting unnecessary obstacles?</p>
<p>Like we&rsquo;re very finicky biological things</p>
<p>in the way of some more robotic or more</p>
<p>silicon based exploration.</p>
<p>And yeah, do we need to colonize and spread?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure.</p>
<p>What do you think is the role of AI in space?</p>
<p>Do you, in your work, again, we&rsquo;ll talk about it,</p>
<p>but do you see more and more of the space vehicles,</p>
<p>spacecraft being run by artificial intelligence systems?</p>
<p>More than just like the flight control,</p>
<p>but like the management?</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t have a lot of color to the dreams</p>
<p>I have about way in the future in AI,</p>
<p>but I do think that removing,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard for humans to even make a trip to Mars,</p>
<p>much less go anywhere farther than that.</p>
<p>And I think we&rsquo;ll have more,</p>
<p>again, I&rsquo;m probably unusual in having these thoughts,</p>
<p>but perhaps be able to generate more knowledge</p>
<p>and understand more if we stop trying to send humans</p>
<p>and instead, I don&rsquo;t know if we&rsquo;re talking about AI</p>
<p>in a truly artificial intelligence way</p>
<p>or AI as we kind of use it today,</p>
<p>but maybe sending a Petri dish or two of like stem cells</p>
<p>and some robotic handlers instead,</p>
<p>if we still need to send our DNA</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re really stuck on that,</p>
<p>but if not, maybe not even that Petri dish.</p>
<p>So I see, I think what I&rsquo;m saying is,</p>
<p>I see a much bigger role in the future</p>
<p>of AI for space exploration.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of sad to think that,</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;ll eventually send a spacecraft</p>
<p>with efficient propulsion,</p>
<p>like some of the stuff you work on out</p>
<p>that travels just really far with some robots on it</p>
<p>and with some DNA in a Petri dish,</p>
<p>and then human civilization destroys itself,</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;ll just be this floating spacecraft</p>
<p>that eventually gets somewhere or not.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a sad thought, like this lonely spacecraft</p>
<p>just kind of traveling through space</p>
<p>and humans are all dead.</p>
<p>Well, it depends on what the goal is, right?</p>
<p>Another way to look at it is we&rsquo;ve preserved,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like a little time capsule of knowledge, DNA,</p>
<p>that will outlive us.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s beautiful.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s how I sleep at night.</p>
<p>So you also mentioned that you wanted to be an astronaut.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So even though you said you&rsquo;re unusual</p>
<p>in thinking like, it&rsquo;s nice here on Earth,</p>
<p>and then we might want to be sending robots up there,</p>
<p>you wanted to be a human that goes out there.</p>
<p>Would you like to one day travel to Mars?</p>
<p>You know, if it becomes sort of more open</p>
<p>to civilian travel and that kind of thing?</p>
<p>Like are you, like vacation wise,</p>
<p>like if we&rsquo;re talking vacations,</p>
<p>would you like to vacation on Earth or vacation on Mars?</p>
<p>I wish that I had a better answer, but no.</p>
<p>I wanted to be an astronaut because I,</p>
<p>first of all, I like working in labs and doing experiments.</p>
<p>And I wanted to go to like the coolest lab, the ISS,</p>
<p>and do some experiments there.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s being decommissioned, which is sad,</p>
<p>but you know, there will be others, I&rsquo;m sure.</p>
<p>The ISS is being decommissioned?</p>
<p>Yes, I think by 2025, it&rsquo;s not going to be in use anymore.</p>
<p>But I think there are other,</p>
<p>there are private companies that are going to be putting up</p>
<p>stations and things.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s primarily like a research lab, essentially.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>A research lab in space, that&rsquo;s a cool way to say it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the coolest possible research lobby.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where I wanted to go.</p>
<p>And now though, my risk profile has changed a little bit.</p>
<p>I have three little ones and I won&rsquo;t be in the first</p>
<p>thousand people to go to Mars, let&rsquo;s put it that way.</p>
<p>Yeah, Earth is kind of nice.</p>
<p>We have our troubles, but overall, it&rsquo;s pretty nice.</p>
<p>Again, it&rsquo;s the Netflix.</p>
<p>Okay, let&rsquo;s talk rockets.</p>
<p>How does a rocket engine work or any kind of engine</p>
<p>that can get us to space or float around in space?</p>
<p>The basic principle is conservation of momentum.</p>
<p>So you throw stuff out the back of the engine</p>
<p>and that pushes the rocket and the spacecraft</p>
<p>in the other direction.</p>
<p>So there are two main types of rocket propulsion.</p>
<p>The one people are more familiar with is chemical</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s loud and there&rsquo;s fire.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s used for launch and is more televised.</p>
<p>So in those types of systems, you usually have a fuel</p>
<p>on an oxidizer and they react and combust</p>
<p>and release stored chemical energy.</p>
<p>And that energy heats the resultant gas</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s funneled out the back through a nozzle,</p>
<p>directed out the back and then that momentum exchange</p>
<p>pushes the spacecraft forward.</p>
<p>Is there an interesting difference in liquid</p>
<p>and solid fuel in those contexts?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re both lumped in the same.</p>
<p>So chemical just means that the release of energy</p>
<p>from those bonds essentially.</p>
<p>So a solid fuel works the same way.</p>
<p>And the other main category is electric propulsion.</p>
<p>So instead of chemical energy,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re using electrical energy,</p>
<p>usually from batteries or solar panels.</p>
<p>And in this case, the stuff you&rsquo;re pushing out the back</p>
<p>would be charged particles.</p>
<p>So instead of combustion and heat,</p>
<p>you end up with charged particles</p>
<p>and you force them out the back of the spacecraft</p>
<p>using either an electrostatic field or electromagnetic.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s the same momentum exchange</p>
<p>and same idea stuff out the back</p>
<p>and everything else goes forward.</p>
<p>Cool, so those are the big two categories.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the difference maybe in the challenges of each,</p>
<p>in the challenges of each, the use cases of each</p>
<p>and how they&rsquo;re used today, the physics of each</p>
<p>and where they&rsquo;re used, all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Anything interesting about the two categories</p>
<p>that distinguishes them?</p>
<p>Besides the chemical one being the big sexy flames.</p>
<p>Yeah, fire.</p>
<p>Fire, yeah.</p>
<p>Chemical is very well understood</p>
<p>in its simplest form, it&rsquo;s like a firework.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s been around since 400 BC or something like that.</p>
<p>So that even the big engines are quite well understood.</p>
<p>I think one of the last gaps there is probably</p>
<p>what exactly are the products of combustion?</p>
<p>Our modeling abilities kind of fall apart there</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s hot and gases are moving</p>
<p>and you end up kind of having to venture</p>
<p>into lots of different interdisciplinary fields of science</p>
<p>to try to solve that.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s quite complex, but we have pretty good models</p>
<p>for some of the more like emergent behaviors</p>
<p>of that system anyways.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s I think one of the last unsolved pieces.</p>
<p>And really the kind of what people care about there</p>
<p>is making it more fuel efficient.</p>
<p>So the chemical stuff, you can get a lot</p>
<p>of instantaneous thrusts, but it&rsquo;s not very fuel efficient.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s much more fuel efficient to go</p>
<p>with the electric type of propulsion.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s where people spend a lot of their time</p>
<p>is trying to make that more efficient in terms</p>
<p>of thrust per unit of fuel.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s always considerations</p>
<p>like heating and cooling.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very hot, which is good if it heats the gases,</p>
<p>but bad if it melts the rocket and things like that.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s always a lot of work on heating</p>
<p>and cooling and the engine cycles and things like that.</p>
<p>And then on electric propulsion,</p>
<p>I find it like much more refreshingly poorly understood.</p>
<p>Lots more mysteries.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think so.</p>
<p>One of the classes I took in college,</p>
<p>we spent 90% of the class on chemical propulsion</p>
<p>and then the last 10% on electric.</p>
<p>And the professor said like,</p>
<p>we only sort of understand how it works,</p>
<p>but it works kind of.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, that&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>Yeah, and even an ion engine,</p>
<p>which is probably one of the most straightforward</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s just an electrostatic engine,</p>
<p>but it has this really awesome combination</p>
<p>of like quantum mechanics and material science</p>
<p>and fluid dynamics and electrostatics.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just very intriguing to me.</p>
<p>First of all, can you actually zoom out even more?</p>
<p>Like, cause you mentioned ion propulsion engine</p>
<p>is a subset of electric.</p>
<p>So like maybe, is there a categories of electric engines</p>
<p>and then we can zoom in on ion propulsion?</p>
<p>Yes, so sure.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the two most kind of conventional types</p>
<p>that have been around since the sixties</p>
<p>are ion engines and hall thrusters.</p>
<p>And ion engines are a little bit simpler</p>
<p>because they don&rsquo;t use a magnetic field</p>
<p>for generating thrust.</p>
<p>And then there are also some other types of plasma engines,</p>
<p>but that don&rsquo;t fit into those two categories.</p>
<p>So just kind of other plasma,</p>
<p>like a VASMIR engine, which we could get into.</p>
<p>And then those are probably the main three categories</p>
<p>that would be fun to talk about.</p>
<p>Oh, and then of course, the category of engine</p>
<p>that I work on, which has a lot of similarities</p>
<p>to an ion engine, but could be considered its own class</p>
<p>called a colloid thruster.</p>
<p>Colloid, cool.</p>
<p>Okay, so what is an ion propulsion, I imagine?</p>
<p>Okay, so in an ion engine, you have an ionization chamber</p>
<p>and you inject the propellant into that chamber.</p>
<p>And this is usually a neutral gas like xenon or argon.</p>
<p>So you inject that into the chamber</p>
<p>and you also inject a stream of really high energy electrons</p>
<p>and everything&rsquo;s just moving around very randomly in there.</p>
<p>And the whole goal is to have one of those electrons</p>
<p>collide with one of those neutral atoms</p>
<p>and turn it into an ion.</p>
<p>So kick off a secondary electron and now you have&hellip;</p>
<p>Plasma.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And now you have a charged xenon or argon ion</p>
<p>and more electrons and so on.</p>
<p>And then some fraction of those ions will happen</p>
<p>to make it to this downstream electric field</p>
<p>that we set up between two grids with holes in them.</p>
<p>And in terms of area, the same amount of those ions</p>
<p>also runs into the walls and lose their charge</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s where some of the inefficiencies come in.</p>
<p>But the very lucky few make it to the downstream</p>
<p>and the very lucky few make it to those holes in that grid</p>
<p>and there are two grids actually</p>
<p>and you apply a voltage differential between them</p>
<p>and that sets up an electric field.</p>
<p>And a charged particle in an electric field</p>
<p>creates a force.</p>
<p>And so those ions are accelerated out the back of the engine</p>
<p>and the reaction force is what pushes the spacecraft forward.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re following along and tallying these charges,</p>
<p>now we&rsquo;ve just sent a positive beam of ions</p>
<p>out the back of the spacecraft and for our purposes here,</p>
<p>the spacecraft is neutral.</p>
<p>So eventually those ions will come back</p>
<p>and hit the spacecraft because it&rsquo;s a positive beam.</p>
<p>So you also have to have an external cathode producer</p>
<p>of electrons outside the engine</p>
<p>that pumps electrons into that beam and neutralizes that.</p>
<p>So now it&rsquo;s net neutral everywhere</p>
<p>and it won&rsquo;t come back to the spacecraft.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s an ion engine.</p>
<p>What temperature are we talking about here?</p>
<p>So in terms of like the chemical based engines,</p>
<p>those are super hot.</p>
<p>You mentioned plasma here.</p>
<p>How hot does this thing get?</p>
<p>I mean, is that an interesting thing to talk about</p>
<p>in a sense that is that an interesting distinction</p>
<p>or is the heat, I mean, it&rsquo;s all gonna be hot.</p>
<p>No, so it&rsquo;s important especially</p>
<p>for some of these smaller satellites</p>
<p>people are into launching these days.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s important because you have the plasma</p>
<p>but also those high energy electrons are hot</p>
<p>and if you have a lot of those that are going into the walls</p>
<p>you do have to care about the temperature.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m having trouble remembering off the top of my head.</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;re at like a hundred electron volts</p>
<p>in terms of the electron energy</p>
<p>and then I&rsquo;d have to remember how to convert that</p>
<p>into Kelvin.</p>
<p>Can you stick your hand in it?</p>
<p>Not move the temperature.</p>
<p>Not recommended, yeah.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s a colloid engine?</p>
<p>So the same rocket people that came up with these ideas</p>
<p>for electric propulsion probably in the middle</p>
<p>of last century also realized that there&rsquo;s one more place</p>
<p>to get charged particles from if you&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to be using electric propulsion.</p>
<p>So you can take a gas and you can ionize it</p>
<p>but there are also some liquids particularly ionic liquids</p>
<p>which is what we use that you also can use</p>
<p>as a source of ions and if you have ions</p>
<p>and you put them in a field you generate a force.</p>
<p>So they recognize that but part of being able</p>
<p>to leverage that technique is being able</p>
<p>to kind of manipulate those liquids on a scale</p>
<p>of nanometers or very few microns.</p>
<p>So the diameter of a human hair or something like that</p>
<p>and in the 50s there was no way to do that.</p>
<p>So they wrote about it in some books</p>
<p>and then it kind of died for a little bit</p>
<p>and then with silicon mems, computer processors</p>
<p>and when foundry started becoming more ubiquitous</p>
<p>and my advisor started at MIT kind of put those ideas</p>
<p>back together and was like, hey actually there&rsquo;s now a way</p>
<p>to build this and bring this other technique to life.</p>
<p>And so the way that you actually get the ions</p>
<p>out of those liquids is you put the liquid</p>
<p>in again a strong electric field</p>
<p>and the electric field stresses the liquid</p>
<p>and you keep increasing the field</p>
<p>and eventually the liquid will assume a conical shape.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s when the electric field pressure that&rsquo;s pulling on it</p>
<p>exactly balances the liquid&rsquo;s own restoring force</p>
<p>which is its surface tension.</p>
<p>So you have this balance and the liquid assumes a cone</p>
<p>when it&rsquo;s perfectly balanced like that</p>
<p>and at the tip of a cone the radius of curvature</p>
<p>goes to zero right at the tip</p>
<p>and the electric field right at the tip of a sharp object</p>
<p>would go to infinity because it goes as one over the radius</p>
<p>and one over the radius squared</p>
<p>and instead of the electric field going to infinity</p>
<p>and maybe like generating a wormhole or something,</p>
<p>a jet of ions instead starts issuing</p>
<p>from the tip of that liquid.</p>
<p>So the field becomes strong enough there</p>
<p>that you can pull ions out of the liquid.</p>
<p>What is the liquid?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking about, there&rsquo;s a bunch of different ones.</p>
<p>You can do it with different types of liquids.</p>
<p>It depends on how easily you can free ions</p>
<p>from their neighbors and if it has enough surface tension</p>
<p>so that you can build up a high enough electric field</p>
<p>but what we use are called ionic liquids</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re really just positive.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re very similar to salts but they happen to be liquid</p>
<p>over a really wide range of temperatures.</p>
<p>This sounds like really cool.</p>
<p>Okay, so how big is the cone we&rsquo;re talking about?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the size of this cone that generates the ions?</p>
<p>So if you have a cone that&rsquo;s emitting pure ions,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t remember if it&rsquo;s the radius or diameter</p>
<p>but that emission is happening from,</p>
<p>of that cone is something like 20 nanometers.</p>
<p>Oh, I was imagining something slightly bigger</p>
<p>but so like this is tiny, tiny.</p>
<p>Hence the only being able to do it recently.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>So this is all controlled by a computer, I guess.</p>
<p>Like, or like, how do you create a cone</p>
<p>that generates ions at a scale of nanometers exactly?</p>
<p>So the kind of main trick to making this work</p>
<p>is that physically we manufacture hundreds</p>
<p>or thousands of sharp structures and then supply the liquid</p>
<p>to the tips.</p>
<p>So that does a few things.</p>
<p>It makes sure that we know where the ion beams are forming.</p>
<p>So we can put holes in the grid above them</p>
<p>to let them actually leave instead of hitting, right?</p>
<p>Cool.</p>
<p>But it also reduces the actual field we have,</p>
<p>the voltage we have to apply to create that field</p>
<p>because the field will be much stronger</p>
<p>if we can already give the liquid a tip to form on.</p>
<p>And those tips we form have radii of curvature</p>
<p>on the order of probably like single microns.</p>
<p>So we are working at a little bit larger scale</p>
<p>but once we create that support</p>
<p>and the electric field can be focused at that tip,</p>
<p>then the tiny little cone can form on top of that.</p>
<p>So wait, so there&rsquo;s something in them,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s already like a hard material</p>
<p>that like gives you the base for the cone</p>
<p>and then you&rsquo;re pouring like liquid over it,</p>
<p>whatever the heck. From the bottom, yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s porous, so we actually supply it</p>
<p>from the back of the chip and then it wicks.</p>
<p>And then liquid forms on top on that structure.</p>
<p>And then you somehow make it like super sharp, the liquid,</p>
<p>so the ions can leave.</p>
<p>And then we&rsquo;ve applied that field to get those ions</p>
<p>and that same field then accelerates them.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s awesome. And there&rsquo;s like a bunch of these?</p>
<p>Yeah, I should have brought something.</p>
<p>So we&hellip;</p>
<p>You could just pretend that you have some nanometer cones</p>
<p>on a table here.</p>
<p>So actually, you know, kind of about this scale,</p>
<p>we build, we call them thruster chips</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just a convenient form factor</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a square centimeter.</p>
<p>And on each square centimeter today,</p>
<p>we have about 500 of the actual physical,</p>
<p>we call them emitters, those physical cones.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re working on increasing that by a factor of four</p>
<p>in the coming months.</p>
<p>In size or in the density?</p>
<p>In number, in the density, the number of emitters</p>
<p>within the same square centimeter chip.</p>
<p>So that thing, cause I think I&rsquo;ve seen pictures of you</p>
<p>with like a tiny thing in your hand.</p>
<p>That must be the&hellip;</p>
<p>Okay, so that&rsquo;s an engine.</p>
<p>So that is kind of the ionization chamber</p>
<p>and thrust producing part of it.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s not shown, you know, in that picture</p>
<p>is the propellant tank.</p>
<p>So we can keep supplying more and more of the liquid</p>
<p>to those emission sites.</p>
<p>And then we also provide a power electronic system</p>
<p>that talks to the spacecraft</p>
<p>and turns our device on and off.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the colloid engine.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the core of the colloid engine.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, the way I&rsquo;ve been talking about it,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s more of ion electrospray colloid</p>
<p>tends to mean like liquid droplets coming off of the jet.</p>
<p>But if you make smaller and smaller cones,</p>
<p>you get pure ions.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re kind of like a subset of colloid, yes.</p>
<p>What aspects of this, you said that it&rsquo;s been full</p>
<p>of mysteries from the physics perspective.</p>
<p>What aspects of this are understood</p>
<p>and what are still full of mystery?</p>
<p>Yeah, recently we&rsquo;ve been understanding</p>
<p>the kind of instabilities and stable regimes of,</p>
<p>you know, how much liquid do you supply</p>
<p>and what field do you apply?</p>
<p>And why is it flickering on and off?</p>
<p>Or why does it have these weird behaviors?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s, in the past just couple of years,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s become much more understood.</p>
<p>I think the two areas that come to mind</p>
<p>as far as not as well understood are</p>
<p>the boundary between, you know, you have,</p>
<p>we actually use kind of big molecular ions.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re looking at the molecular scale,</p>
<p>you have, you know, some ions that you&rsquo;ve extracted</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re in this electric field.</p>
<p>One ion, you know, it&rsquo;s a big molecule,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s getting energy from the electric field.</p>
<p>And some of that energy is going into the bonds</p>
<p>and making it vibrate and doing weird things to it.</p>
<p>Sometimes it breaks them apart.</p>
<p>And then zooming out to the whole beam,</p>
<p>the beam has some behaviors as this beam of ions.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a big gap between what are those,</p>
<p>how do you connect those?</p>
<p>And how do we understand that better</p>
<p>so that we can understand the beam performance</p>
<p>of the engine?</p>
<p>Is that a theory question or is it an engineering question?</p>
<p>Theory, definitely.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re, Axion is a startup and we&rsquo;re more in the business</p>
<p>of building and testing and observing and characterizing.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re not really diving much into that theory right now.</p>
<p>Okay, zooming out a little bit on the physics,</p>
<p>apologize for the way too big of a question,</p>
<p>but to you from either, you mentioned Axion is,</p>
<p>you know, more of sort of an engineering endeavor, right?</p>
<p>But from a perspective of physics in general,</p>
<p>science in general, or the side of engineering,</p>
<p>what do you think is the most, to you,</p>
<p>like beautiful and captivating</p>
<p>and inspiring idea in this space?</p>
<p>In this space, and then I&rsquo;m gonna zoom out</p>
<p>a little bit more, but in this space,</p>
<p>I keep butting up against material science questions.</p>
<p>So I, over the past 10 years,</p>
<p>I feel like every problem or interesting thing</p>
<p>I want to work on, if you dig deep enough,</p>
<p>you end up in material science land,</p>
<p>which I find kind of exciting</p>
<p>and it makes me want to dig in more there.</p>
<p>And I was just, you know, even for our technology,</p>
<p>when we have to move the propellant from the tank</p>
<p>to the tip of the emitters, we rely a lot on capillary action</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re getting into wetting and surface energies.</p>
<p>At a scale of like nano scale.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, it&rsquo;s, if you look further, it&rsquo;s quantum too,</p>
<p>but it all is, you know,</p>
<p>a capillary action at the quantum level.</p>
<p>Yeah, so I would, it all comes back to me to, you know,</p>
<p>material science, there&rsquo;s so much we don&rsquo;t understand</p>
<p>at these sizes and I find that inspiring and exciting.</p>
<p>And then more broadly, you know,</p>
<p>I remember when I learned that the same equation</p>
<p>that describes flow over an airfoil</p>
<p>is used to price options, the Black Scholes equation,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s, you know, just a partial differential equation,</p>
<p>but that kind of connectedness of the universe,</p>
<p>you know, I don&rsquo;t want to use options pricing</p>
<p>and the universe in the same, but you know what I mean,</p>
<p>this connectedness I find really magical.</p>
<p>Yeah, the patterns that mathematics reveals</p>
<p>seems to echo in a bunch of different places.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s just weirdness.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, it really makes you think,</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re definitely living in a simulation,</p>
<p>like whoever programmed it.</p>
<p>I like that that&rsquo;s your conclusion.</p>
<p>Is using like shortcuts to program it,</p>
<p>like they didn&rsquo;t, they&rsquo;re just copying and pasting some codes</p>
<p>for the different parts.</p>
<p>Yeah, think of something new or just paste from over there.</p>
<p>They won&rsquo;t notice.</p>
<p>My conclusion from that was I&rsquo;m gonna go interview</p>
<p>for a finance job, so I had like a little detour.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the backup option.</p>
<p>So in terms of using call it engines,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s an interesting difference between a propulsion</p>
<p>of a rocket from earth when you&rsquo;re standing</p>
<p>on the ground to orbit and then the kind of propulsion</p>
<p>necessary for once you get out to orbit</p>
<p>or to like deep space to move around.</p>
<p>Yes, the reason you can&rsquo;t use an engine like mine</p>
<p>to get off the ground is, the thrust it generates</p>
<p>is instantaneous thrust is very small,</p>
<p>but if you have the time and can accumulate</p>
<p>that acceleration, you can still reach speeds</p>
<p>that are very interesting for exploration</p>
<p>and even for missions with humans on them.</p>
<p>An interesting direction I think we need to go</p>
<p>as humans exploring space is the power supplies</p>
<p>for electric propulsion are limiting us</p>
<p>in that solar panels are really inefficient</p>
<p>and bulky and batteries.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know when anybody&rsquo;s ever gonna improve</p>
<p>battery technology.</p>
<p>I know a lot of people that work on that.</p>
<p>And nuclear power, we could have a lot more powerful</p>
<p>electric propulsion system.</p>
<p>So they would be extremely fuel efficient,</p>
<p>but more instantaneous thrust to do more interesting</p>
<p>missions if we could start launching more nuclear systems.</p>
<p>So like something that&rsquo;s powered, nuclear powered,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the right way to say it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But is in a small enough container that could be launched?</p>
<p>Yeah, so I mean, as a world we do launch spacecraft</p>
<p>with nuclear power systems on board,</p>
<p>but size is one consideration.</p>
<p>It hasn&rsquo;t been a big focus.</p>
<p>So the reactors and the heaters and everything are bulky.</p>
<p>And so they&rsquo;re really only suitable for some</p>
<p>of the much bigger interplanetary stuff.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s one issue, but then it&rsquo;s a whole like rat&rsquo;s nest</p>
<p>of political stuff as well.</p>
<p>I heard, I think Elon described or somebody,</p>
<p>I think it was Elon that described the EV to all</p>
<p>like electrical, vertical takeoff and landing vehicles.</p>
<p>So basically saying rockets, obviously Elon is interested</p>
<p>in electric vehicles, right?</p>
<p>But he said that rockets can&rsquo;t, in the near term,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t make sense for them to be electrical.</p>
<p>What, do you see a world with the rockets that we use</p>
<p>to get into orbit are also electric based?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s possible, you can produce the thrust levels you need,</p>
<p>but you need this, a much bigger power supply.</p>
<p>And I think that would be nuclear.</p>
<p>And the only way people have been able to launch them at all</p>
<p>is that they&rsquo;re in a 100 times redundancy safe mode</p>
<p>while they&rsquo;re being launched and they&rsquo;re not turned on</p>
<p>until they&rsquo;re farther off.</p>
<p>So if you were to actually try to use it on launch,</p>
<p>I think a lot of people would still have an issue with that,</p>
<p>but someday.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an interesting concept, nuclear.</p>
<p>It seems like people, like everybody that works</p>
<p>on nuclear power has shown how safe it is</p>
<p>as a source of energy.</p>
<p>And yet we are, seem to be, I mean, based on the history,</p>
<p>based on the excellent HBO series,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Russian with a Chernobyl.</p>
<p>It seems like we have our risk estimation</p>
<p>about this particular power source is drastically inaccurate,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s a fascinating idea that we would use nuclear</p>
<p>as a source for our vehicles and not just in outer space.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s cool.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna have to look into that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s super interesting.</p>
<p>Well, just last year, Trump eased up a little bit</p>
<p>on the regulations and NASA and hopefully others</p>
<p>are starting to pick up on the development.</p>
<p>So now is a good time to look into it</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s actually some movement.</p>
<p>Is that a hope for you to explore different energy sources</p>
<p>that the entirety of the vehicle uses something</p>
<p>like the entirety of the propulsion systems</p>
<p>for all aspects of the vehicle&rsquo;s life travel</p>
<p>is the same or electric?</p>
<p>Is it possible for it to be the same?</p>
<p>Like the colloid engine being used for everything?</p>
<p>You could, and you would have to do it in the same way</p>
<p>we do different stages of rockets now</p>
<p>where once you&rsquo;ve used up an engine or a stage,</p>
<p>you let it go because there&rsquo;s really no point</p>
<p>in holding onto it.</p>
<p>So I wouldn&rsquo;t necessarily want to use the same engine</p>
<p>for the whole thing, but the same technology</p>
<p>I think would be interesting.</p>
<p>Okay, so it&rsquo;s possible.</p>
<p>All right, but in terms of.</p>
<p>Yeah, it comes down to the power source.</p>
<p>The power source, that&rsquo;s really interesting.</p>
<p>But for the current power sources</p>
<p>and its current use cases, what&rsquo;s the use case</p>
<p>for electric, like the colloid engine?</p>
<p>Can you talk about where they&rsquo;re used today?</p>
<p>Sure, so chemical engines are still used quite a bit</p>
<p>once you&rsquo;re in orbit, but that&rsquo;s also</p>
<p>where you might choose instead to use an electric system</p>
<p>and what people do with them.</p>
<p>And this includes the ion engines and hall thrusters</p>
<p>and our engine is basically any maneuvering you need to do</p>
<p>once you&rsquo;re dropped off.</p>
<p>Even if your only goal was to just stay in your orbit</p>
<p>and not move for the life of your mission,</p>
<p>you need propulsion to accomplish that</p>
<p>because the Earth&rsquo;s gravity field changes</p>
<p>as you go around in orbit and pulls you</p>
<p>out of your little box.</p>
<p>There are other perturbations that can throw you off a bit.</p>
<p>And then most people want to do things</p>
<p>a little bit more interesting like maneuver</p>
<p>to avoid being hit by space debris</p>
<p>or perhaps lower their orbit to take a higher resolution</p>
<p>image of something and then return.</p>
<p>At the end of your mission, you&rsquo;re supposed</p>
<p>to responsibly get rid of your satellite,</p>
<p>whether that&rsquo;s burning it up, but if you&rsquo;re in geo,</p>
<p>you want to push it higher into graveyard orbit.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s geo and what&rsquo;s graveyard?</p>
<p>So low Earth orbit and then geosynchronous orbit</p>
<p>or geostationary orbit.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a graveyard?</p>
<p>Yeah, so those satellites are at like 40,000 kilometers.</p>
<p>So if they were to try to push their satellites</p>
<p>back down to burn up in the atmosphere,</p>
<p>they would need even more propulsion</p>
<p>than they&rsquo;ve had for the whole lifetime of their mission.</p>
<p>So instead they push them higher</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;ll take a million years</p>
<p>for it to naturally deorbit.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re also cluttering that higher bit up as well,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not as pressing as Leo, which is low Earth orbit</p>
<p>where more of these commercial missions are going now.</p>
<p>Well, so how hard is the collision avoidance problem there?</p>
<p>You said some debris and stuff.</p>
<p>So like how much propulsion is needed?</p>
<p>Like how much is the life of a satellite</p>
<p>is just like a crap trying to avoid</p>
<p>like little things down there?</p>
<p>I think one of the recent rules of thumb I heard</p>
<p>was per year some of these small satellites</p>
<p>are doing like three collision avoidance maneuvers.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s not, yeah, but it&rsquo;s not zero.</p>
<p>And it takes a lot of planning and people on the ground</p>
<p>and none of that really, I don&rsquo;t think right now</p>
<p>is autonomous.</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s not good.</p>
<p>Yeah, and then we have a lot of folks</p>
<p>taking advantage of Moore&rsquo;s law and cheaper spacecraft.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re launching them up</p>
<p>without the ability to maneuver themselves.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re like, well, I don&rsquo;t know, just don&rsquo;t hit me.</p>
<p>And three times a year that could become affordable</p>
<p>if it gets hit, maybe it won&rsquo;t be damaged kind of thing,</p>
<p>that kind of logic.</p>
<p>Affordable in that instead of launching one satellite,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll launch 20 small ones.</p>
<p>Yeah, so if one gets taken out, that&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>But the problem is that one good sized satellite</p>
<p>getting hit, that&rsquo;s like a ballistic event</p>
<p>that turns into 10,000 pieces of debris</p>
<p>that then are the things that go and hit the other satellites.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So do you see a world where, like in your sense,</p>
<p>in your own work and just in the space industry in general,</p>
<p>do you see the people moving towards bigger satellites</p>
<p>or smaller satellites?</p>
<p>Is there going to be a mix?</p>
<p>Like what&rsquo;s, and what do we talk,</p>
<p>what does it mean for a satellite to be big and small?</p>
<p>What size are we talking about?</p>
<p>So big, the space industry prior to,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, 1990, I guess the bulk of,</p>
<p>the majority of satellites were the size of a school bus</p>
<p>and cost a couple billion dollars.</p>
<p>And now our first launches were on satellites</p>
<p>the size of shoe boxes that were built</p>
<p>by high school students.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a very different,</p>
<p>to give you the two ends of the spectrum.</p>
<p>So big satellites will, I think they&rsquo;re here to stay,</p>
<p>at least as far as I can see into the future</p>
<p>for things like broadcasting.</p>
<p>You want to be able to broadcast</p>
<p>to as many people as possible.</p>
<p>You also can&rsquo;t just go to small satellites</p>
<p>and say Moore&rsquo;s law for things like optics.</p>
<p>So if you have an aperture on your satellite,</p>
<p>that just, that doesn&rsquo;t follow Moore&rsquo;s law.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s different.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s always going to be the size that it will be,</p>
<p>unless there&rsquo;s some new physics that comes out</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m not aware of.</p>
<p>But if you need a resolution and you&rsquo;re at an altitude,</p>
<p>that kind of sets your, the size of your telescope.</p>
<p>But because of Moore&rsquo;s law,</p>
<p>we are able to do a lot more with smaller packages.</p>
<p>And with that comes more affordability</p>
<p>and opening up access to space to more and more people.</p>
<p>Well, what&rsquo;s the smallest satellite you&rsquo;ve seen go up there?</p>
<p>Like what are the smallest kind of, you said shoe boxes.</p>
<p>Yeah, so I think the smallest common form factor</p>
<p>can fit a softball inside.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s 10 centimeters on each side.</p>
<p>But then there are some companies working on</p>
<p>fractions of that even.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re doing things like IOT type application.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s very low bandwidth type things,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re finding some niches for those.</p>
<p>Do you mean like there&rsquo;s a business,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a thing to do with them?</p>
<p>Yes, either.</p>
<p>What do you do with a small satellite like that?</p>
<p>You can track a ship going across the ocean.</p>
<p>Like if you need to, if you&rsquo;re just pinging something,</p>
<p>you can handle that amount of data</p>
<p>and those latencies and so on.</p>
<p>You have to have propulsion on that.</p>
<p>You have to have a little engine.</p>
<p>No, those are just letting fall out of the sky.</p>
<p>Okay, so what kind of satellite</p>
<p>would you equip a colloid engine on?</p>
<p>Anything that&rsquo;s bigger than probably about 20 kilograms,</p>
<p>anything that needs to stay up for more than a year</p>
<p>or anything somebody spent more than like 100K to build</p>
<p>are kind of the ways I would think about it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a lot of use cases.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s a small sat?</p>
<p>Like what category?</p>
<p>Small sat is actually very big.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s like 700 kilograms,</p>
<p>or I keep hitting my microphone,</p>
<p>maybe 1,000 kilograms down to 200 kilograms.</p>
<p>People have their own kind of definitions</p>
<p>of how they break them up,</p>
<p>but small sat is still quite large.</p>
<p>And then it&rsquo;s kind of also applied as a blanket term</p>
<p>for anything that&rsquo;s not a school bus size satellite.</p>
<p>So we need to get our jargon straight in the industry.</p>
<p>So do you see a possible future where,</p>
<p>you know, there&rsquo;s a few thousand satellites up there now,</p>
<p>a couple of thousand of them functioning.</p>
<p>Do you see a future where there&rsquo;s like millions</p>
<p>of satellites up in orbit?</p>
<p>Or forget millions, tens of thousands,</p>
<p>which just seems like where the natural trajectory</p>
<p>of the way things are going now is going.</p>
<p>Tens of thousands, yes.</p>
<p>The two buckets of applications,</p>
<p>one is imaging and the other is communication.</p>
<p>So imaging, I think that will plateau</p>
<p>because one satellite or one constellation</p>
<p>can take an image or a video</p>
<p>and sell it to, you know, infinity customers.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re providing communications</p>
<p>like broadband internet or satellite cell</p>
<p>or something like that, satellite phone,</p>
<p>you know, you&rsquo;re limited by your transponders and so on.</p>
<p>So to serve more people, you actually need more satellites</p>
<p>and perhaps at the rate, you know, our data consumption</p>
<p>and things are going these days.</p>
<p>Yeah, I can see tens of thousands of satellites.</p>
<p>Can I ask you a ridiculous question?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve recently watched this documentary on Netflix</p>
<p>about flat earthers, you know,</p>
<p>the people that believe in a flat earth.</p>
<p>As somebody who develops propulsion systems</p>
<p>for satellites and for spacecraft,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s, do you use the most convincing evidence</p>
<p>that the earth is round?</p>
<p>Probably some of the photos taken from the moon.</p>
<p>Photos from the moon?</p>
<p>Okay, so it&rsquo;s not from the satellite space.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think seeing that perspective,</p>
<p>maybe I&rsquo;m just, I&rsquo;m answering too personally</p>
<p>because I really love those photos.</p>
<p>Because they&rsquo;re beautiful, yeah.</p>
<p>I really like the ones that show the moon</p>
<p>and the lunar lander and they&rsquo;re taken</p>
<p>a little bit farther back.</p>
<p>So you see earth and first you&rsquo;re like, wow, that&rsquo;s tiny</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re insignificant and that&rsquo;s kind of sad.</p>
<p>But then you see this really cool thing</p>
<p>that we landed on another planetary body</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re like, oh, okay.</p>
<p>Can you actually see earth?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if I remember this.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;ll send you that picture.</p>
<p>Because I love the pictures or videos</p>
<p>of just earth from orbit and so on.</p>
<p>Right, yeah.</p>
<p>Just like those, that&rsquo;s really beautiful.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like a perspective shifter.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the pale blue dot, right?</p>
<p>It probably appears tiny.</p>
<p>Yeah, and just that juxtaposition of the insignificance,</p>
<p>but we built this, really cool thing.</p>
<p>And I just love that, yeah.</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;d be cool.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t, I personally love the idea</p>
<p>of humans stepping on Mars.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m such a sucker for the romantic notion of that</p>
<p>and being able to take pictures from Mars next.</p>
<p>So you would go?</p>
<p>I, yeah, I would be, what did you say?</p>
<p>You said you wouldn&rsquo;t be the first one.</p>
<p>Not in the first 1,000.</p>
<p>1,000, which it&rsquo;s funny because to me,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s brave to be in the first million.</p>
<p>I think when the Declaration of Independence</p>
<p>was signed in the United States,</p>
<p>that was like two million people.</p>
<p>So I would like to show up</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re signing those documents.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So maybe the two million.</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s an interesting way to think about it.</p>
<p>Because like then we&rsquo;re like participating</p>
<p>in citizenry and defining the direction.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not the technical risk.</p>
<p>You just don&rsquo;t wanna show up somewhere</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like America before.</p>
<p>Yeah, because I, from a psychological perspective,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just gonna be a stressful mess</p>
<p>as people have studied, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s people, most likely the process</p>
<p>of colonization like looks like basically a prison.</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;re in a very tight and closed space with people.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just a really stressful environment.</p>
<p>How do you select the kind of people that will go</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;ll be drama.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s always drama.</p>
<p>And I just wanna show up when there&rsquo;s some rules.</p>
<p>But I mean, you know, it depends.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not worried about the health</p>
<p>and the technical difficulties.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m more worried about the psychological difficulties.</p>
<p>And also just not being able to tweet.</p>
<p>Like what are you gonna, how are you talking?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no Netflix.</p>
<p>So yeah, maybe not in the first million,</p>
<p>but the first 100,000.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s exciting to define the direction of a new,</p>
<p>like how often do we not just have a revolution</p>
<p>to redefine our government,</p>
<p>as smaller countries are still doing to this day,</p>
<p>but literally start over from scratch.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just our financial system.</p>
<p>It could be like based on cryptocurrency,</p>
<p>you could think about like how democracy,</p>
<p>we have now the technology that can enable pure democracy,</p>
<p>for example, if we choose to do that,</p>
<p>as opposed to representative democracy,</p>
<p>all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>So we talked about two different forms of propulsion,</p>
<p>which are super exciting.</p>
<p>So the chemical based, that&rsquo;s doing pretty well.</p>
<p>And then the electric based is,</p>
<p>are there types of propulsion</p>
<p>that might sound like science fiction right now,</p>
<p>but are actually within the reach of science</p>
<p>in the next 10, 20, 30, 50 years</p>
<p>that you kind of think about,</p>
<p>or maybe even within the space of even just like,</p>
<p>like even ION engines,</p>
<p>is there like breakthroughs that might 10 X the thing,</p>
<p>like really improve it?</p>
<p>So, you know, the real game changer</p>
<p>would be propellantless propulsion.</p>
<p>And so every couple of years you see a new,</p>
<p>now a startup or a researcher comes up with some contraption</p>
<p>for producing thrust that didn&rsquo;t require,</p>
<p>you know, we&rsquo;ve been talking about conservation of momentum,</p>
<p>mass times velocity out the back,</p>
<p>mass times velocity forward.</p>
<p>Yes, exactly.</p>
<p>And you have to, you know, carry that up with you</p>
<p>or find it on an asteroid or harvest it from somewhere</p>
<p>if you didn&rsquo;t bring it with you.</p>
<p>So not having to do that would be, you know,</p>
<p>one of the ultimate game changers.</p>
<p>And I, you know, unless there are new types of physics,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how we do it,</p>
<p>but it comes up often, so it&rsquo;s something I do think about.</p>
<p>And, you know, the one,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s called the Casimir effect.</p>
<p>If you can, if you have two plates</p>
<p>and the space between them is on the order of these,</p>
<p>like the wavelength of these ephemeral vacuum particles</p>
<p>that pop into and out of existence or something.</p>
<p>I may be confusing multiple types of propellantless forces,</p>
<p>but that could be real</p>
<p>and could be something that we use eventually.</p>
<p>What would be the power source?</p>
<p>Yeah, the most recent engine like this</p>
<p>that was just debunked this year, I think,</p>
<p>in March or something was called the M drive.</p>
<p>And supposedly you used a power source,</p>
<p>so, you know, batteries or solar panels</p>
<p>to generate microwaves into this resonant cavity.</p>
<p>And people claimed it produced thrust.</p>
<p>So they went straight from this really loose concept</p>
<p>to building a device and testing it.</p>
<p>And they said, we&rsquo;ve measured thrust</p>
<p>and sure on their thrust balance, they saw thrust</p>
<p>and different researchers built it and tested it</p>
<p>and got the same measurements.</p>
<p>And so it was looking actually pretty good.</p>
<p>No one could explain how it worked,</p>
<p>but what they said was that this inside the cavity,</p>
<p>the microwaves themselves didn&rsquo;t change,</p>
<p>but the speed of light changed inside the cavity.</p>
<p>So relative to that, you know,</p>
<p>their momentum was conserved.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t, you know, whatever.</p>
<p>But finally someone, I think at NASA built the device,</p>
<p>tested it, got the same thrust, then unhooked it,</p>
<p>flipped it backwards and turned it on,</p>
<p>but got the same thrust in the same direction again.</p>
<p>And so they&rsquo;re like, this is just an interaction</p>
<p>with the test setup or, you know,</p>
<p>some of the chamber or something like that.</p>
<p>So forwarded again, but, you know,</p>
<p>it would be so wonderful for everybody</p>
<p>if we could figure out how to do it, but I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an interesting twist on it</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s more about efficient travel,</p>
<p>long distance travel, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not necessarily about speed.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s more about enabling like,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s hook that up to the nuclear power supply.</p>
<p>There you go.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>But still in terms of speed, in terms of trying to,</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s recently, already I think been debunked</p>
<p>or close to being debunked, but the signal,</p>
<p>a weird signal from our nearby friends,</p>
<p>nearby exoplanets from Proxima Centauri,</p>
<p>a signal that&rsquo;s 4.2 light years away.</p>
<p>So, you know, the thought is it&rsquo;d be kind of cool</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s life out there, alien life,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;d be really cool if it could fly out there and check.</p>
<p>And so what kind of propulsion,</p>
<p>and do you think about what kind of propulsion</p>
<p>will allow us to travel close to the speed of light</p>
<p>or, you know, half the speed of light,</p>
<p>all those kinds of things that would allow us</p>
<p>to get to Proxima Centauri and have reasonable,</p>
<p>in a lifetime?</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s the project Breakthrough Starshot.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s looking at sending those tiny little chip sets.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like accelerating really fast.</p>
<p>Yeah, using a laser, so launching them</p>
<p>and then while they&rsquo;re still relatively close to the earth,</p>
<p>you know, blasting them with some,</p>
<p>I forget what, even what power level you needed</p>
<p>to accelerate them fast enough to get there in 20 years.</p>
<p>Super crazy sounding,</p>
<p>but a lot of people say that&rsquo;s a legitimate,</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s crazy sounding, but it can actually pull it off.</p>
<p>Yeah, I love that project</p>
<p>because there are a lot of different aspects.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s the laser,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s how do you then get enough power</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re there to send a signal back.</p>
<p>No part of that project is possible right now,</p>
<p>but I think it&rsquo;s really exciting.</p>
<p>But do you see like human, like a spacecraft</p>
<p>with a human on it, so it&rsquo;s like a heavy one,</p>
<p>being like us inventing new propulsion systems entirely.</p>
<p>Like, do you ever see that on the radar</p>
<p>of propulsion systems like that</p>
<p>or are they completely out there in the impossible?</p>
<p>Well, we&rsquo;re going to quickly leave the realm</p>
<p>of what I can describe with any credibility,</p>
<p>but I think because of special relativity,</p>
<p>if we try to accelerate some mass</p>
<p>close to the speed of light, it becomes infinitely heavy</p>
<p>and then we just don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;d have to like harness a lot of suns to do that.</p>
<p>Or, you know, it&rsquo;s just that math doesn&rsquo;t quite work out,</p>
<p>but, you know, in my child&rsquo;s, my childlike heart,</p>
<p>I believe that, you know, we&rsquo;re missing something,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s, you know, dark matter or other dimensions.</p>
<p>And if you can just have some anti matter</p>
<p>and a black hole and then ride that around</p>
<p>and somehow, you know, turn that into some.</p>
<p>Mess with gravity somehow.</p>
<p>Yeah, I feel like we&rsquo;re missing lots of things</p>
<p>in this puzzle and that, you know.</p>
<p>I want to heart that puzzle.</p>
<p>Yeah, right.</p>
<p>I can speak with confidence as a descendant of apes</p>
<p>that we don&rsquo;t know what the hell we&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s, we&rsquo;re like really confident,</p>
<p>like physicists are really confident</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve like got most of the picture down,</p>
<p>but it feels like, oh boy,</p>
<p>it feels like that we might not even be getting started</p>
<p>on some of the essential things</p>
<p>that would allow us to engineer systems</p>
<p>that would allow us to travel to space much, much faster.</p>
<p>Yeah, and there&rsquo;s even things</p>
<p>that are much more commonplace that we can&rsquo;t explain,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;ve started to take for granted,</p>
<p>like quantum tunneling, you know,</p>
<p>just things like, oh, the electron was here</p>
<p>with this energy and now it&rsquo;s here with this energy</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just tunneling.</p>
<p>But so, you know, we&rsquo;re missing a lot of the picture.</p>
<p>So yeah, I don&rsquo;t know, to, you know,</p>
<p>use your same question from earlier,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you and I will see it,</p>
<p>but yeah, someday.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re the cofounder of,</p>
<p>just like we&rsquo;ve been talking about, Axion Systems.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a, would you say a space propulsion company?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Broadly speaking.</p>
<p>So how do you, big question,</p>
<p>how do you build a rocket company</p>
<p>from like a propulsion company from one person,</p>
<p>from two people to 10 people plus,</p>
<p>and actually, you know, take it to a successful product?</p>
<p>Yeah, well, I think the early stage is quite,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not supposed to use the word easy</p>
<p>when you work in rocket science,</p>
<p>but straightforward when you&rsquo;re working on something,</p>
<p>you know, sexy, like an ion engine,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s more straightforward to raise money</p>
<p>and get people to come work for you</p>
<p>because the vision&rsquo;s really exciting.</p>
<p>And actually that&rsquo;s something I would say</p>
<p>is very important throughout,</p>
<p>is a really exciting vision</p>
<p>because when everything, you know, goes to crap,</p>
<p>you need that to get people</p>
<p>getting themselves out of bed in the morning</p>
<p>and thinking of the higher purpose there.</p>
<p>And, you know, another thing along the way</p>
<p>that I think is key in building any company</p>
<p>is the right early employees</p>
<p>that also have their own networks</p>
<p>and can bring in a lot of people</p>
<p>that, you know, really make the whole greater</p>
<p>than just the sum of the early team.</p>
<p>How do you build that?</p>
<p>Like, how do you find people?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like asking, like, how do you make friends?</p>
<p>But is there, is it luck?</p>
<p>Is there a system?</p>
<p>Like how, in terms of the people you&rsquo;ve connected with,</p>
<p>the people you built the company with,</p>
<p>is there some thread, some commonality,</p>
<p>some pattern that you find to be,</p>
<p>to hold for what makes a great team?</p>
<p>I think, you know, personally,</p>
<p>a thread for me has been my network</p>
<p>and being able to draw on that a lot,</p>
<p>but also giving back to it as much as possible</p>
<p>in like an unsolicited sort of way,</p>
<p>like making connections between people</p>
<p>that, you know, maybe didn&rsquo;t ask,</p>
<p>but that I think could be really fruitful.</p>
<p>And even, you know, weirder than that</p>
<p>is just really getting, you know,</p>
<p>having weird, uncomfortable conversations</p>
<p>with people like at a conference</p>
<p>and getting over the small talk quickly</p>
<p>and getting to know them quickly</p>
<p>and having a relationship that stands out</p>
<p>and then being able to call on them later because of that.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s been because I&rsquo;m introverted</p>
<p>and I, you know, want to poke my eyes out</p>
<p>instead of go and do small talk.</p>
<p>And so I huddle in a corner with one person</p>
<p>and, you know, we talk about aliens or things like that.</p>
<p>And so, you know, that&rsquo;s all to say that,</p>
<p>you know, having a strong network,</p>
<p>I think is really important, but a genuine one.</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s see, other ways to build a rocket company,</p>
<p>kind of making sure you&rsquo;re paying attention</p>
<p>to the sweeping trends of the industry</p>
<p>so everybody just cares about cost</p>
<p>and being able to get out ahead of that</p>
<p>and even more than we ever thought we&rsquo;d need to</p>
<p>as far as what we needed to price our systems at.</p>
<p>You know, people for,</p>
<p>since the start of the US space industry,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve been paying 20, 25 million in adjusted dollars</p>
<p>for an ion engine.</p>
<p>And seeing that now people are going to want to pay 10K</p>
<p>for an ion engine and just staying out ahead of that</p>
<p>and those kinds of things.</p>
<p>So, you know, being out in the industry</p>
<p>and talking to as many people as possible.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a drive.</p>
<p>I mean, I suppose SpaceX really pushed that.</p>
<p>Frustrating for me.</p>
<p>So SpaceX really pushed this,</p>
<p>the application of, I guess, capitalism</p>
<p>of driving the price down,</p>
<p>of basically forcing people to ask the question,</p>
<p>can this be done cheaper?</p>
<p>This can lead to like big problems, I would say,</p>
<p>in the following sense.</p>
<p>I see this in the car industry, for example,</p>
<p>that people have,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s such a small margin for profit.</p>
<p>Like they&rsquo;ve driven the cost of everything down so much</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s literally no room for innovation</p>
<p>for taking risks.</p>
<p>So like cars, which is funny</p>
<p>because not until Tesla, really,</p>
<p>which is one of the, in a long, long time,</p>
<p>one of the first successful new car companies</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s constantly innovating,</p>
<p>every other car company is really pouring</p>
<p>in terms of their technological innovation.</p>
<p>They innovate on design and style and so on,</p>
<p>that people fall in love with the look and so on,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not really innovation.</p>
<p>In terms of the technology in it,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really boringly the same thing,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re really afraid of taking risks.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a big problem for rocket space, too,</p>
<p>is like if you&rsquo;re cutting out costs,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t afford to innovate, to try out new things,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s definitely true with ion engines, right?</p>
<p>So how do you compete in this space?</p>
<p>Do you, by the way, see SpaceX as a competitor?</p>
<p>And what do you say in general</p>
<p>about the competition in this space?</p>
<p>Is it really difficult as a business to compete here?</p>
<p>No, I don&rsquo;t see SpaceX as a competitor,</p>
<p>and I see them as one day, not too long from now,</p>
<p>a customer, hopefully.</p>
<p>I mean, to compete against that,</p>
<p>I think you just have to do things in an unconventional way.</p>
<p>So bringing silicon MEMS manufacturing</p>
<p>to propulsion, NASA doesn&rsquo;t make ion engines</p>
<p>using a batch mass producible technique.</p>
<p>They have one guy that&rsquo;s been making their ion engines</p>
<p>for 20 years bespoke pieces of jewelry.</p>
<p>So bringing things to what you&rsquo;re trying to innovate</p>
<p>to make them, in our case, more cost effective</p>
<p>was really key.</p>
<p>I like the idea of somebody putting out ion engines</p>
<p>on like Etsy.</p>
<p>Yeah, my advisor at MIT would,</p>
<p>the thruster chip I was holding up,</p>
<p>he would wear one as a lapel pin.</p>
<p>But in general, just on the topic of SpaceX,</p>
<p>2020 has seen some difficult things</p>
<p>for human civilization.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s been a lot of, first of all, it&rsquo;s an election year,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s been a lot of drama and division about that.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s been riots of all different reasons,</p>
<p>racial division, there&rsquo;s been obviously a virus</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s testing the very fabric of our society.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s been really, for me at least,</p>
<p>super positive things, inspiring things,</p>
<p>which is SpaceX and NASA doing the first commercial</p>
<p>human flight, launching humans to space</p>
<p>and did it twice successfully.</p>
<p>What is that, did you get to watch that launch?</p>
<p>Did you, what does it make you feel?</p>
<p>Do you think this is first days</p>
<p>for a new era of space exploration?</p>
<p>Yeah, I did watch it.</p>
<p>We played it outside on a big screen at our place.</p>
<p>And I was a little, they kept saying Bob and Doug,</p>
<p>Bob and Doug, and astronauts usually are treated</p>
<p>with a little bit more fanfare.</p>
<p>So it felt very casual, but maybe that was a good,</p>
<p>a good thing, like this is the era</p>
<p>of commercial crewed missions.</p>
<p>It was a little bit more, what is it?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s his name?</p>
<p>Chris Hadfield, like playing guitar.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more, it&rsquo;s a different flavor to it of.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>More like fun, playful, celebrity type.</p>
<p>Yes, exactly.</p>
<p>Astronaut versus the aura of the magical</p>
<p>sort of heroic element of the single human</p>
<p>representing us in space.</p>
<p>Yes, I think that&rsquo;s all for the better though.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so cool that it&rsquo;s such a commonplace thing</p>
<p>now that we send.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t believe that sometimes I&rsquo;ll have to,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t even realize that astronauts are coming</p>
<p>and going all the time, splashing back down.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just so common now,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s quite magical, I think.</p>
<p>So yes, we did watch that.</p>
<p>I love, love, love that we finally have that capability</p>
<p>again to send people to the space station.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just really exciting to see the private sector</p>
<p>stepping up to fill in where the government</p>
<p>has pulled back in the US.</p>
<p>And I think pulled back way too soon</p>
<p>as far as exploration and science goes.</p>
<p>Probably pulled back at the right time</p>
<p>for commercial things and getting that started.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m really happy that it&rsquo;s even possible</p>
<p>to do that with private money and companies.</p>
<p>Do you like the kind of the model of competition</p>
<p>of NASA funding?</p>
<p>I guess that&rsquo;s how it works,</p>
<p>is like they&rsquo;re providing quite a bit of money</p>
<p>from the government and then private companies compete</p>
<p>to be the delivery vehicles for whichever</p>
<p>the government missions, like NASA missions.</p>
<p>Yes, I think for this type of mission</p>
<p>is a little bit kind of straddles commercial and science.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s good, but I do in general feel</p>
<p>like we&rsquo;ve pulled back too much on NASA&rsquo;s role</p>
<p>in the science and exploration part.</p>
<p>And I think our pace is too slow there,</p>
<p>for my liking, I suppose.</p>
<p>What do you mean?</p>
<p>Okay, so did you have, I mean, on the cost thing,</p>
<p>do you feel like NASA was a little too bureaucratic</p>
<p>in a sense, like too slow, too heavy cost wise</p>
<p>in their effort, like when they were running things</p>
<p>purely without any commercial involvement?</p>
<p>So I suppose it&rsquo;s more that I just want</p>
<p>the government to fund.</p>
<p>I see, yeah.</p>
<p>And maybe NASA&rsquo;s not the best organization</p>
<p>to do it rapidly.</p>
<p>But I think that, again, depending on the goals,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re just kind of at the very starting point</p>
<p>of space exploration and science and understanding.</p>
<p>So we should be spending more money there and not less.</p>
<p>And other countries are starting to spend more and more,</p>
<p>and I think we&rsquo;ll fall behind because of that.</p>
<p>So you have quite a bit of experience, first of all,</p>
<p>starting a company yourself, but also I saw,</p>
<p>maybe you can correct me, but you have quite a bit</p>
<p>of knowledge of just in general the startup experience</p>
<p>of building companies that you&rsquo;ve interacted with people.</p>
<p>Is there advice that you can give to somebody,</p>
<p>to a founder or cofounder who wants to launch</p>
<p>and grow a new company and do something big and impactful</p>
<p>in this world?</p>
<p>Yes, I would say, like I mentioned earlier,</p>
<p>but make sure the vision is something that will get you</p>
<p>out of bed in the morning and that you can rally</p>
<p>other people around you to achieve.</p>
<p>Because I see a lot of folks that sort of cared</p>
<p>about something or saw a window of opportunity</p>
<p>to do something, and startups are hard,</p>
<p>and more often than not, just being opportunistic</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t going to be enough to make it through</p>
<p>all the really crappy things that are going to happen.</p>
<p>So the vision just helps you psychologically</p>
<p>to carry through the hardships,</p>
<p>for you and the team.</p>
<p>Yeah, you and the team, yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>To kind of younger people interested in getting</p>
<p>into entrepreneurship, I would say stay as close</p>
<p>to first principles and fundamentals as you can</p>
<p>for as long as you can, because really understanding</p>
<p>the problems, if it&rsquo;s something scientific</p>
<p>or hardware related, or even if it&rsquo;s not,</p>
<p>but having a deep understanding of the problem</p>
<p>and the customers and what people care about</p>
<p>and how to move something forward is more important</p>
<p>than taking all of the entrepreneurship classes</p>
<p>in undergrad.</p>
<p>So being able to think deeply, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>Yeah, have you been surprised about how much pivoting</p>
<p>is involved, basically rethinking what you thought</p>
<p>initially would be the right direction to go?</p>
<p>Or is there, if you think deeply enough,</p>
<p>that you can stick in the same direction for long enough?</p>
<p>So our guiding star hasn&rsquo;t changed at all,</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s been pretty consistent,</p>
<p>but within that, we flip flop on so many things</p>
<p>all the time, and to give you one example,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s do you stop and build a first product</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s well suited to maybe a smaller,</p>
<p>less exciting segment of the market,</p>
<p>or do you stay head down and focus on the big swing</p>
<p>and trying to hit it out of the park right away?</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve flip flopped between that,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s not a blanket answer,</p>
<p>and there are a lot of factors, but that&rsquo;s a hard one.</p>
<p>And I think one other piece for the aspiring founder,</p>
<p>spending a lot of time and effort on the culture</p>
<p>and people piece is so important</p>
<p>and is always an afterthought and something</p>
<p>that I haven&rsquo;t really seen the founders or executives</p>
<p>or executives at companies purposefully carve out time</p>
<p>and acknowledge that, yes, this is going to take</p>
<p>a lot of my time and resources,</p>
<p>but you see them after the fact trying to repair</p>
<p>the bro culture or whatever else is broken at the company.</p>
<p>And I think that it&rsquo;s starting to change,</p>
<p>but just to be aware of it from the beginning is important.</p>
<p>Right, I guess it should be part of the vision</p>
<p>of what kind of place you want to create,</p>
<p>or what kind of human beings.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly, you can&rsquo;t wait five, 10 years</p>
<p>and then just slap an HR person onto trying to fix it.</p>
<p>It has to be thoughtful from the beginning.</p>
<p>Yeah, don&rsquo;t get me started on HR people.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t leave HR to HR people, but I&rsquo;ll just leave it at that.</p>
<p>You didn&rsquo;t say that, I said it, okay.</p>
<p>Yeah, HR&rsquo;s actual HR is really important,</p>
<p>is so important, culture is so important.</p>
<p>And then I also was surprised, I thought you could say,</p>
<p>here will be our culture and our values,</p>
<p>and that it was kind of distinct from who I</p>
<p>and my co founder were as people,</p>
<p>and I was like, no, that&rsquo;s not how that works.</p>
<p>We just kind of ooze out our behaviors</p>
<p>and then the company grows around that.</p>
<p>So you have to do a lot of introspection and self work</p>
<p>to not end up with a shitty culture.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of a, it&rsquo;s a relationship,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s supposed to be a relationship with two people,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a relationship with many people.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And you communicate so much indirectly by who you are.</p>
<p>You have to be, you have to live it, yeah.</p>
<p>As somebody, I think about this a lot</p>
<p>because generally I&rsquo;m full of love</p>
<p>and all those kinds of things,</p>
<p>but I also get really passionate</p>
<p>and when I see somebody in the context of work, especially,</p>
<p>when I see somebody who I know can do a much better job</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t do a great job, I can lose my shit</p>
<p>in a way that&rsquo;s like Steve Jobsian.</p>
<p>And you have to think about exactly the right way</p>
<p>to lose your shit if you&rsquo;re going to, or if at all.</p>
<p>You have to really think through that</p>
<p>because it sends a big signal.</p>
<p>You know, sometimes it&rsquo;s okay, like if you do it deliberately,</p>
<p>like if you&rsquo;re going to do it deliberately,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re going to say like,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to be the kind of person that allows this</p>
<p>and pays the cost of it,</p>
<p>but you can&rsquo;t just think it&rsquo;s not gonna have a cost.</p>
<p>Yes, this was like the first thing I worked on</p>
<p>with my leadership coach was how not to just snap at people</p>
<p>when they were being an idiot.</p>
<p>And first I got really good at apologizing.</p>
<p>That was the first step because it was going to take longer</p>
<p>to fix the behavior.</p>
<p>And then she, I&rsquo;m actually a lot better at it now</p>
<p>and it started with things.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s like, every time you walk through a doorway,</p>
<p>think, you know, calm and take breaths before responding.</p>
<p>And there were all sorts of these little things we did</p>
<p>and it was mostly just changing the habit.</p>
<p>Yeah, oh boy, it&rsquo;s a long road.</p>
<p>Okay, so people love it and we talk about books.</p>
<p>Is there books, maybe three or so technical fiction,</p>
<p>philosophical that had an impact on your life</p>
<p>and you might recommend and for each,</p>
<p>is there an idea or so that you take away from it?</p>
<p>Yes, so I&rsquo;ve been a voracious reader all my life</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m always reading like three or four or five books</p>
<p>at a time and now I use Audible a lot too</p>
<p>and you know, podcasts and things like that.</p>
<p>So I think the first one that stands out to me is 10,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a novel, Tender is the Night by Fitzgerald.</p>
<p>And I read it when I was much younger</p>
<p>but I went back and read it recently and it&rsquo;s not that good.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not sure why it has like such an important place</p>
<p>in my literary history but I love Fitzgerald as an author</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s very like flowery prose</p>
<p>that I can just picture what he&rsquo;s saying</p>
<p>but he does it in such a creative way.</p>
<p>I remember that one in particular</p>
<p>because I read a ton as a kid too</p>
<p>but it kind of set me, it was like the beginning of my adult</p>
<p>reading life and getting into classics</p>
<p>and I kind of, I do feel like they seem intimidating maybe</p>
<p>and then I realized that they&rsquo;re all just like love stories.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>Yeah, isn&rsquo;t everything a love story?</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s really.</p>
<p>At the bottom.</p>
<p>Even, you know, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I was surprised that even like a lot of the Russian authors,</p>
<p>you know, they&rsquo;re all just love stories.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re humans are pretty simple.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not much to worry, there&rsquo;s not much to work with.</p>
<p>So I think maybe that was it.</p>
<p>It made like that whole world less intimidating to me</p>
<p>and cemented my love for reading.</p>
<p>People should have just approached the classics</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s probably a love story in here.</p>
<p>Chick flicks, yeah.</p>
<p>So somehow it boils down to a chick flick.</p>
<p>So just relax and enjoy the ride.</p>
<p>And then.</p>
<p>So what else?</p>
<p>Changing gears quite a bit.</p>
<p>The Beginning of Infinity, do you know it?</p>
<p>By David Deutsch.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s a physicist at Cambridge or Oxford.</p>
<p>And so I was introduced like more formally</p>
<p>to a lot of the ideas, like a lot of the things</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve talked about, he has a lot more like formalism</p>
<p>and physics rigor around.</p>
<p>And so I got introduced to, you know, more like jargon</p>
<p>of how to think about some of these ideas,</p>
<p>you know, like memes and, you know, DNA as ultimate meme,</p>
<p>the concept of infinity and objective beauty.</p>
<p>But he has a really strong grounding in physics.</p>
<p>And then.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a rigorous way of talking about these like big.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So that was very mind opening to me to read that.</p>
<p>But it also, I think it&rsquo;s probably part of why</p>
<p>I ended up marrying my husband is related to that book.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;ve had some other really great connections</p>
<p>with people because I had read it and so had they.</p>
<p>I like how you turned that, even that book</p>
<p>into a love story.</p>
<p>I did, oh no.</p>
<p>Somehow.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s good, it&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>Your robot has a heart.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>And okay, the third series is, it&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s Harry Potter.</p>
<p>Of course, which somehow connects to,</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t read Harry Potter.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really sorry.</p>
<p>Oh no.</p>
<p>Forgive me, forgive me.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ve read Tolkien, but just Harry Potter,</p>
<p>just haven&rsquo;t gotten to it.</p>
<p>But your company name is somehow I think</p>
<p>connected to Harry Potter, right?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I think I heard this.</p>
<p>My, I always feel like I have to justify my fandom.</p>
<p>The first three books came out when I was 10.</p>
<p>So I went along this journey with Harry, age wise.</p>
<p>And I read them all like nine or 10 times, all seven books.</p>
<p>And I think anything that just keeps you reading</p>
<p>is what&rsquo;s important.</p>
<p>And I have lulls where I don&rsquo;t feel like reading anything.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll reread a Harry Potter or a trashy detective novel</p>
<p>or something, and I don&rsquo;t really care.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why I mentioned Harry Potter</p>
<p>because whatever just keeps me reading,</p>
<p>I think is important.</p>
<p>And it was a big part of my life growing up.</p>
<p>And then yes, Axion, the official story of the naming</p>
<p>of the company is that Axion is like a concatenation</p>
<p>of accelerate and ion.</p>
<p>But it actually came from accio, the summoning charm.</p>
<p>And then we just added an N and it was perfect.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the summoning charm?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of the spells in Harry Potter.</p>
<p>Yeah, probably most notably Harry uses it</p>
<p>to summon his broomstick out of his dorm room</p>
<p>when he&rsquo;s battling a dragon somewhere else.</p>
<p>So he says the spell and the broomstick comes to him.</p>
<p>So summoning in that way.</p>
<p>Okay, there we go.</p>
<p>This is brilliant.</p>
<p>So the big thing is that it&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve carry with, it&rsquo;s like your safe place</p>
<p>you return to something like the Harry Potter.</p>
<p>That, I reread them still, whatever keeps me reading</p>
<p>I think is the most important thing.</p>
<p>Okay, I got it.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m actually the same way in terms of the habit of it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to just keep reading.</p>
<p>But I have found myself struggling a little bit too</p>
<p>because I listen to a lot of audio books now.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve struggled to then switch back to reading seriously.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just I read so many papers,</p>
<p>I read so many other things.</p>
<p>It feels like if I&rsquo;m gonna sit down</p>
<p>and have the time to actually focus on the reading</p>
<p>I should be reading like blog posts or papers</p>
<p>or more condensed kind of things.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a huge value to just reading long form still.</p>
<p>Yeah, and my husband was never that into fiction</p>
<p>but then someone told him or he heard,</p>
<p>you learn a lot of empathy through reading fiction.</p>
<p>So you could think of it that way.</p>
<p>Well, yeah, that&rsquo;s kind of what, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s also fiction is a nice,</p>
<p>unlike not less so with nonfiction is a chance to travel.</p>
<p>I see it as kind of traveling.</p>
<p>As you go to this other world and it&rsquo;s nice</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s like much more efficient.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to get on a plane,</p>
<p>and you get to meet all kinds of new people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like people say they love traveling</p>
<p>and I say I love traveling too.</p>
<p>I just, yeah, read fiction.</p>
<p>I told my three year old that that was why we read so much</p>
<p>because we see the places in our mind</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m like, it&rsquo;s basically like we&rsquo;re watching a movie.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how it feels.</p>
<p>And she&rsquo;s like, I prefer watching Frozen with popcorn,</p>
<p>was her response that.</p>
<p>Okay, well, you&rsquo;re three.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good point.</p>
<p>But yeah, there&rsquo;s some power to the imagination, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not just like watching a movie</p>
<p>because something about our imagination</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s the words in the world that&rsquo;s painted</p>
<p>somehow mixing in with our own understanding</p>
<p>of our own hopes and dreams, our fears.</p>
<p>It like mixes up in there</p>
<p>and the way we can build up that world from just the page.</p>
<p>Yeah, you&rsquo;re really creating the world</p>
<p>just with the prompts from the book, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s different than watching a movie.</p>
<p>Yeah, which is why it hurts sometimes</p>
<p>to watch the movie version</p>
<p>and then you&rsquo;re like, that&rsquo;s not at all how I imagined it.</p>
<p>Well, we kind of brought this up in terms of</p>
<p>depending on what the goals are.</p>
<p>Let me ask the big, you&rsquo;re friends with Manolis,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s obsessed with this question.</p>
<p>So let me ask the big ridiculous question</p>
<p>about the meaning of life.</p>
<p>Do you ever think about this one?</p>
<p>Do you ever ponder the reason we&rsquo;re here?</p>
<p>Descends as the vapes on this spinning ball</p>
<p>in the middle of nowhere?</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t think one ends up</p>
<p>in the field of space propulsion</p>
<p>without thinking of these existential questions.</p>
<p>Yeah, all the time.</p>
<p>Or builds a business.</p>
<p>Yeah, I know, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, we&rsquo;ve touched on a lot of the different pieces</p>
<p>of this, I think.</p>
<p>So I have a bunch of thoughts.</p>
<p>I do think that the goal isn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>the meaning isn&rsquo;t anymore just to be like a Petri dish</p>
<p>of bacteria that reproduces</p>
<p>and where survival and reproduction are the main objectives.</p>
<p>And maybe it&rsquo;s because now we&rsquo;re able to answer these,</p>
<p>ask those questions.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s maybe the turning point.</p>
<p>And instead, I think it&rsquo;s really the pursuit</p>
<p>and generation of knowledge.</p>
<p>And so if we&rsquo;re taken out by an asteroid or something,</p>
<p>I think that it will have been a meaningful endeavor</p>
<p>if somehow our knowledge about the universe</p>
<p>is preserved somehow and the next civilization</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t starting over again.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s, I always, yeah, I resonate with that.</p>
<p>I always loved the mission of Google from the early days</p>
<p>of making the world&rsquo;s sort of information</p>
<p>and knowledge searchable.</p>
<p>I always loved that idea.</p>
<p>I always loved, I was donated as people should to Wikipedia.</p>
<p>I just love Wikipedia.</p>
<p>I feel like it&rsquo;s the, that&rsquo;s one of the greatest</p>
<p>accomplishments of just a humanity of us together,</p>
<p>especially Wikipedia and this opens like</p>
<p>in this open community way,</p>
<p>putting together different knowledge is like,</p>
<p>on everything we&rsquo;ve talked about today,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s a Wikipedia page about ion engines</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s pretty good.</p>
<p>Like, it&rsquo;s, I don&rsquo;t know, that&rsquo;s incredible.</p>
<p>And obviously that can be preserved pretty efficiently,</p>
<p>at least Wikipedia.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, you&rsquo;ll be like, human civilization</p>
<p>is all like burning up in flames</p>
<p>as there&rsquo;s this one USB drive slowly traveling out.</p>
<p>Yeah, I know, exactly.</p>
<p>With Wikipedia on it.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s on, from the beginning of our chat,</p>
<p>that one lonely spacecraft.</p>
<p>It just needs Wikipedia.</p>
<p>And then it will have been a civilization well spent.</p>
<p>So pushing that knowledge along.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Through like one little discovery at a time</p>
<p>is one of, is a core aspect to the meaning of it all.</p>
<p>Yes, and I also, I haven&rsquo;t yet figured out</p>
<p>what the connection, you know, an explanation</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m happy with yet for how it&rsquo;s connected,</p>
<p>but evolving beyond just the survival piece too,</p>
<p>I think like we touched on the emotional aspect,</p>
<p>something in there about cooperation and, you know, love.</p>
<p>And so I, in my day to day that just boils down to,</p>
<p>you know, the pursuit of knowledge</p>
<p>or improving the human condition and being kind.</p>
<p>Love and knowledge.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m pretty at peace with that as the meaning right now.</p>
<p>Makes sense to me.</p>
<p>While you work on spacecraft propulsion.</p>
<p>Yes, exactly.</p>
<p>Like literal rocket science.</p>
<p>Natalia, this is an amazing conversation.</p>
<p>You work on such an exciting engineering field.</p>
<p>And I think this is like what 20th, 21st century</p>
<p>will be remembered for is space exploration.</p>
<p>So this is super exciting space that you&rsquo;re working on.</p>
<p>So, and thank you so much</p>
