    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>where we discuss science</p>
<p>and science-based tools for everyday life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Andrew Huberman,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology</p>
<p>at Stanford School of Medicine.</p>
<p>Today, my guest is Dr. Wendy Suzuki.</p>
<p>Dr. Suzuki is a professor of neuroscience and psychology</p>
<p>at New York University,</p>
<p>and one of the leading researchers</p>
<p>in the area of learning and memory.</p>
<p>Her laboratory has contributed</p>
<p>fundamental textbook understanding</p>
<p>of how brain areas such as the hippocampus,</p>
<p>which you will learn about today,</p>
<p>how the hippocampus and related brain circuits</p>
<p>allow us to take certain experiences</p>
<p>and commit them to memory</p>
<p>so that we can use that information in the future.</p>
<p>Dr. Suzuki is also an expert public educator</p>
<p>in the realm of science.</p>
<p>A few years back, she had a TED Talk</p>
<p>that essentially went viral.</p>
<p>If you haven&rsquo;t seen it already,</p>
<p>you should absolutely check it out,</p>
<p>in which she describes her experience using exercise</p>
<p>as a way to enhance learning and memory.</p>
<p>And on the basis of that personal experience,</p>
<p>she reshaped her laboratory</p>
<p>to explore how things like meditation, exercise,</p>
<p>and other things that we can do with our physiology</p>
<p>and our psychology can allow us to learn faster,</p>
<p>to commit things to memory longer,</p>
<p>and indeed to reshape our cognitive performance</p>
<p>in a variety of settings.</p>
<p>As such, I am delighted to announce</p>
<p>that Dr. Suzuki is now not only running a laboratory</p>
<p>at New York University,</p>
<p>but she is the incoming Dean of Arts and Science</p>
<p>at New York University.</p>
<p>And of course, she was selected for that role</p>
<p>for her many talents,</p>
<p>but one of the important aspects of her program,</p>
<p>she tells me, is going to be to incorporate</p>
<p>the incredible power of exercise, meditation,</p>
<p>and other behavioral practices for enhancing learning,</p>
<p>for improving stress management,</p>
<p>and other things to optimize student performance.</p>
<p>Today, you are going to get access</p>
<p>to much of that information</p>
<p>so that you can apply those tools</p>
<p>in your daily life as well.</p>
<p>Dr. Suzuki is also an author of several important books.</p>
<p>The most recent one is entitled,</p>
<p>The Good Anxiety,</p>
<p>Harnessing the Power of the Most Misunderstood Emotion,</p>
<p>and a previous book entitled, Healthy Brain, Happy Life,</p>
<p>A Personal Program to Activate Your Brain</p>
<p>and Do Everything Better.</p>
<p>And while that is admittedly a very pop science type title,</p>
<p>I will remind you that she is one</p>
<p>of the preeminent memory researchers in the world</p>
<p>and has been for quite a while.</p>
<p>So the information that you&rsquo;ll glean from those books</p>
<p>is both rich in depth and breadth and is highly applicable.</p>
<p>By the end of today&rsquo;s discussion,</p>
<p>you will have learned from Dr. Suzuki,</p>
<p>a large amount of knowledge about how memories are formed,</p>
<p>how they are lost,</p>
<p>and you will have a much larger kit of tools to apply</p>
<p>for your efforts to learn better, to remember better,</p>
<p>and to apply that information</p>
<p>in the ways that best serve you.</p>
<p>Before we begin,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to emphasize that this podcast</p>
<p>is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.</p>
<p>It is however, part of my desire and effort</p>
<p>to bring zero cost to consumer information about science</p>
<p>and science-related tools to the general public.</p>
<p>Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens.</p>
<p>Athletic Greens is an all-in-one</p>
<p>vitamin mineral probiotic drink.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been taking Athletic Greens since 2012,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m delighted that they&rsquo;re sponsoring the podcast.</p>
<p>The reason I started taking Athletic Greens</p>
<p>and the reason I still take Athletic Greens</p>
<p>once or twice a day is that it helps me cover</p>
<p>all of my basic nutritional needs.</p>
<p>It makes up for any deficiencies that I might have.</p>
<p>In addition, it has probiotics,</p>
<p>which are vital for microbiome health.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done a couple of episodes now</p>
<p>on the so-called gut microbiome</p>
<p>and the ways in which the microbiome interacts</p>
<p>with your immune system, with your brain to regulate mood,</p>
<p>and essentially with every biological system</p>
<p>relevant to health throughout your brain and body.</p>
<p>With Athletic Greens, I get the vitamins I need,</p>
<p>the minerals I need,</p>
<p>and the probiotics to support my microbiome.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Athletic Greens,</p>
<p>you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>and claim a special offer.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll give you five free travel packs</p>
<p>plus a year supply of vitamin D3 K2.</p>
<p>There are a ton of data now showing that vitamin D3</p>
<p>is essential for various aspects of our brain</p>
<p>and body health.</p>
<p>Even if we&rsquo;re getting a lot of sunshine,</p>
<p>many of us are still deficient in vitamin D3.</p>
<p>And K2 is also important because it regulates things</p>
<p>like cardiovascular function,</p>
<p>calcium in the body, and so on.</p>
<p>Again, go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>to claim the special offer of the five free travel packs</p>
<p>and the year supply of vitamin D3 K2.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Element.</p>
<p>Element is an electrolyte drink</p>
<p>that has everything you need and nothing you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>That means the exact ratios of electrolytes are an element,</p>
<p>and those are sodium, magnesium, and potassium,</p>
<p>but it has no sugar.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked many times before on this podcast</p>
<p>about the key role of hydration and electrolytes</p>
<p>for nerve cell function, neuron function,</p>
<p>as well as the function of all the cells</p>
<p>and all the tissues and organ systems of the body.</p>
<p>If we have sodium, magnesium, and potassium</p>
<p>present in the proper ratios,</p>
<p>all of those cells function properly,</p>
<p>and all our bodily systems can be optimized.</p>
<p>If the electrolytes are not present,</p>
<p>and if hydration is low,</p>
<p>we simply can&rsquo;t think as well as we would otherwise,</p>
<p>our mood is off, hormone systems go off,</p>
<p>our ability to get into physical action,</p>
<p>to engage in endurance and strength,</p>
<p>and all sorts of other things is diminished.</p>
<p>So with Element, you can make sure</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re staying on top of your hydration</p>
<p>and that you&rsquo;re getting the proper ratios of electrolytes.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Element, you can go to drinkelement,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s lmnt.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll get a free Element sample pack</p>
<p>with your purchase.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all delicious.</p>
<p>So again, if you want to try Element,</p>
<p>you can go to elementlmnt.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Thesis.</p>
<p>Thesis makes what are called nootropics,</p>
<p>which means smart drugs.</p>
<p>Now, to be honest, I am not a fan of the term nootropics.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe in smart drugs in the sense</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t believe that there&rsquo;s any one substance</p>
<p>or collection of substances that can make us smarter.</p>
<p>I do believe based on science, however,</p>
<p>that there are particular neural circuits</p>
<p>and brain functions that allow us to be more focused,</p>
<p>more alert, access creativity, be more motivated, et cetera.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just the way that the brain works,</p>
<p>different neural circuits for different brain states.</p>
<p>Thesis understands this.</p>
<p>And as far as I know, they&rsquo;re the first nootropics company</p>
<p>to create targeted nootropics for specific outcomes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Thesis for more than six months now,</p>
<p>and I can confidently say that their nootropics</p>
<p>have been a total game changer.</p>
<p>My go-to formula is the clarity formula,</p>
<p>or sometimes I&rsquo;ll use their energy formula before training.</p>
<p>To get your own personalized nootropic starter kit,</p>
<p>go online to takethesis.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>take a three-minute quiz,</p>
<p>and Thesis will send you four different formulas</p>
<p>to try in your first month.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s takethesis.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>and use the code Huberman at checkout</p>
<p>for 10% off your first order.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pleased to announce that the Huberman Lab Podcast</p>
<p>has now partnered with Momentus Supplements.</p>
<p>We partnered with Momentus for several important reasons.</p>
<p>First of all, they ship internationally,</p>
<p>because we know that many of you</p>
<p>are located outside of the United States.</p>
<p>Second of all, and perhaps most important,</p>
<p>the quality of their supplements is second to none,</p>
<p>both in terms of purity and precision</p>
<p>of the amounts of the ingredients.</p>
<p>Third, we&rsquo;ve really emphasized supplements</p>
<p>that are single ingredient supplements,</p>
<p>and that are supplied in dosages</p>
<p>that allow you to build a supplementation protocol</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for cost,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for effectiveness,</p>
<p>and that you can add things</p>
<p>and remove things from your protocol</p>
<p>in a way that&rsquo;s really systematic and scientific.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to see the supplements</p>
<p>that we partner with Momentus on,</p>
<p>you can go to livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>There you&rsquo;ll see those supplements,</p>
<p>and just keep in mind that we are constantly expanding</p>
<p>the library of supplements available through Momentus</p>
<p>on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>And now for my discussion with Dr. Wendy Suzuki.</p>
<p>Wendy, great to see you again,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s been a little while.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a while, so great to be here, Andrew.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for having me.</p>
<p>Yeah, delighted.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to start off by talking about memory generally,</p>
<p>and then I&rsquo;d love to chat about your incredible work,</p>
<p>discovering how exercise and memory interface</p>
<p>and what people can do to improve their memory</p>
<p>and brain function generally.</p>
<p>But for those that are not familiar,</p>
<p>maybe you could just step us through</p>
<p>the basic elements of memory.</p>
<p>A few brain structures, perhaps.</p>
<p>You know, what happens when I, for instance,</p>
<p>this mug of tea, it&rsquo;s pretty unremarkable,</p>
<p>but the fact that now I&rsquo;ve talked about it,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know that I&rsquo;ll ever forget about it.</p>
<p>Maybe I will, maybe I won&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>So what happens when I look at this mug</p>
<p>and decide that it&rsquo;s something special for whatever reason?</p>
<p>Yeah, well, I like to say there are four things</p>
<p>that make things memorable.</p>
<p>Number one is novelty.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s something new, the very first thing,</p>
<p>the very first time we&rsquo;ve seen something</p>
<p>or experienced something, our brains are drawn to that.</p>
<p>Our attentional systems draw us to that.</p>
<p>And when you are paying attention to something,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s part of what makes things memorable.</p>
<p>Second is repetition.</p>
<p>If you see that cup of tea every single day</p>
<p>and every single time you do an interview,</p>
<p>you talk about your cup of tea, you&rsquo;re gonna remember it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just how our brains work, repetition works.</p>
<p>Third is association.</p>
<p>So if you meet somebody new</p>
<p>that knows lots of people that you know,</p>
<p>so you and I share many, many, many, many people</p>
<p>that we both know, it&rsquo;s easier to remember you,</p>
<p>especially if you were somebody new</p>
<p>that I hadn&rsquo;t met before, we have met before.</p>
<p>So association.</p>
<p>And then the fourth one is emotional resonance.</p>
<p>So we remember the happiest</p>
<p>and the saddest moments of our lives.</p>
<p>And that also includes funny, surprising things.</p>
<p>That is the interaction between two key brain structures,</p>
<p>the amygdala, which is important for processing</p>
<p>lots of emotional,</p>
<p>particularly threatening kinds of situations.</p>
<p>But those threatening, surprising kinds of situations,</p>
<p>the amygdala takes that information</p>
<p>and makes another key structure called the hippocampus</p>
<p>work better to put new long-term memories in your brain.</p>
<p>So that in fact is the key structure for long-term memory,</p>
<p>this structure called the hippocampus.</p>
<p>Fantastic, so novelty, repetition, association</p>
<p>and emotional resonance.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>You can tell us a bit more about the hippocampus.</p>
<p>I think at least for my generation,</p>
<p>well, I&rsquo;m a neuroscientist,</p>
<p>but for most people in my generation,</p>
<p>I think they first heard about the hippocampus</p>
<p>from the movie Memento,</p>
<p>where the guy says hippocampus.</p>
<p>And for those of you that haven&rsquo;t seen that movie,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a bizarrely constructed movie,</p>
<p>but an interesting one nonetheless about memory.</p>
<p>But even as a neuroscientist,</p>
<p>sometimes I&rsquo;m perplexed at how the hippocampus works.</p>
<p>Maybe you could, if you would,</p>
<p>step us through kind of what this structure is,</p>
<p>what it looks like, maybe a few of its sub-regions,</p>
<p>because unlike vision,</p>
<p>the topic that I&rsquo;ve worked most of my career on,</p>
<p>where we know, okay, the eye does this part</p>
<p>and the thalamus does this part</p>
<p>and the cortex does that part,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always been a little perplexed</p>
<p>about the hippocampus, frankly.</p>
<p>So, and I&rsquo;ve read the textbooks and I&rsquo;ve heard the lectures,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;d love to get the update.</p>
<p>What are the general themes of the hippocampus</p>
<p>as a structure and its function?</p>
<p>What do you think everyone, including neuroscientists,</p>
<p>should know about the hippocampus?</p>
<p>Absolutely, so let&rsquo;s start with the basics.</p>
<p>The word hippocampus means seahorse.</p>
<p>It is shaped, the structure is shaped</p>
<p>like a kind of curly Q seahorse, that is accurate.</p>
<p>Everybody, including neuroscientists,</p>
<p>should know it&rsquo;s a beautiful structure.</p>
<p>It is visually anatomically beautiful</p>
<p>with these kind of intertwining,</p>
<p>twirly sub-regions within it.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s one of the reasons why early anatomists,</p>
<p>neuroscientists got attracted to it</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s this interesting kind of twirly structure</p>
<p>deep in the heart of the brain.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s anatomically.</p>
<p>Functionally, what does it do?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s easiest to understand what it does</p>
<p>when you look at what happens</p>
<p>when you don&rsquo;t have a hippocampus anymore.</p>
<p>What if you, what if by some disease</p>
<p>or you have your hippocampus removed by accident,</p>
<p>what happens?</p>
<p>Well, we know this from the most famous</p>
<p>neurological patient of all time.</p>
<p>His initials were HM, so all psychology</p>
<p>and neuroscience students know him.</p>
<p>He was operated in 1954</p>
<p>and the paper was published in 1957.</p>
<p>They removed both his hippocampi</p>
<p>because he had very terrible epilepsy.</p>
<p>And they knew that the hippocampus</p>
<p>was the genesis of epilepsy.</p>
<p>And this was experimental.</p>
<p>His epilepsy was so bad that they decided</p>
<p>not just to remove one hippocampus, but both.</p>
<p>And what happened was immediate loss</p>
<p>of all ability to form new memories for facts and events.</p>
<p>Think about that for a second.</p>
<p>All facts or events, you&rsquo;re not able to remember.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t remember this interaction between us.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t remember any of the facts</p>
<p>that we were just chatting about in our neuroscience lives.</p>
<p>None of that can move into our long-term memory.</p>
<p>So this hippocampus does something</p>
<p>with all of these perceptions that are coming at us</p>
<p>every single day, every minute of the day,</p>
<p>and not for all of them, but for some of them</p>
<p>that have these features that we just talked about.</p>
<p>Maybe they&rsquo;re novel, maybe they have associations,</p>
<p>maybe they&rsquo;re emotionally relevant,</p>
<p>maybe they&rsquo;ve been repeated.</p>
<p>Some of those things in the realm of facts or events</p>
<p>get encoded in our long-term memory.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the textbook</p>
<p>of why the hippocampus is so important.</p>
<p>I like to always add, and I mean,</p>
<p>this is why I studied it for so many years.</p>
<p>The hippocampus and what it does</p>
<p>really defines our own personal histories.</p>
<p>It means it defines who we are.</p>
<p>Because if we can&rsquo;t remember what we&rsquo;ve done,</p>
<p>the information we&rsquo;ve learned,</p>
<p>and the events of our lives, it changes us.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what really defines us.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I wanted to study the hippocampus.</p>
<p>And I think the exciting new ideas</p>
<p>about the hippocampus was, is,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s, you know, hippocampus is important for memory.</p>
<p>So if you say that, you&rsquo;ll impress all your people</p>
<p>at your cocktail party.</p>
<p>But what people have started to realize</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s not just memory,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not just putting together associations</p>
<p>for what, where, and when of events</p>
<p>that happened in our past,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s putting together information</p>
<p>that is in our long-term memory banks</p>
<p>in interesting new ways.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking about imagination.</p>
<p>So without the hippocampus,</p>
<p>yes, you can&rsquo;t remember things,</p>
<p>but actually you&rsquo;re not able to imagine events</p>
<p>or situations that you&rsquo;ve never experienced before.</p>
<p>So what that says is the hippocampus is important for memory</p>
<p>is a too simple a way to think about it.</p>
<p>What the hippocampus is important for</p>
<p>is what we&rsquo;ve already talked about,</p>
<p>associating things together writ large.</p>
<p>Anytime you need to associate something together,</p>
<p>either for your past, your present, or your future,</p>
<p>you are using your hippocampus.</p>
<p>And it takes on this much more important role</p>
<p>in our cognitive lives when we think about it like that.</p>
<p>That is kind of the new hippocampus</p>
<p>that neuroscientists are studying these days.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fantastic.</p>
<p>It sounds like it really sets context,</p>
<p>but it can do that with elements from the past,</p>
<p>the present, or the future.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And for neuroscientists, the phrase is domain.</p>
<p>We say the time domain,</p>
<p>meaning as opposed to just evaluating things in space.</p>
<p>It sounds like the time domain of hippocampal functioning</p>
<p>is incredibly interesting.</p>
<p>It is.</p>
<p>And even the fact that we can have short-term,</p>
<p>medium-term, and long-term memories.</p>
<p>And we could go down any of these rabbit holes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll ask you a true or false,</p>
<p>mostly because I just really want to know the answer.</p>
<p>A few years ago, the theme in various high-profile reviews</p>
<p>seemed to be that the hippocampus was involved</p>
<p>in encoding and creating memories,</p>
<p>but not in storing memories,</p>
<p>and that the memory storage was in the neocortex</p>
<p>or the other overlying areas of the brain.</p>
<p>Is that too general a statement?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a tricky statement</p>
<p>because I think that ultimately, yes,</p>
<p>that long-term memories are stored in the cortex,</p>
<p>but those memories are stored in the hippocampus</p>
<p>sometimes for a very, very long time.</p>
<p>So how long is too long</p>
<p>where you say, oh, it&rsquo;s not the hippocampus anymore?</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s four years, is that?</p>
<p>Does that mean that it&rsquo;s not stored in the hippocampus?</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a tricky question.</p>
<p>And yes, it was coming up a lot</p>
<p>because people were debating it.</p>
<p>And some people did think that you shouldn&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>about the hippocampus as a storage area,</p>
<p>but I think it&rsquo;s a long, long, long-term</p>
<p>kind of intermediate storage area,</p>
<p>maybe not the long-term storage area.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s hard to answer that question.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>As I recall, H.M. could remember facts</p>
<p>from before his surgery.</p>
<p>He couldn&rsquo;t form new memories.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>And given that he had no hippocampus,</p>
<p>it would at least partially support the idea</p>
<p>that some memories are retained outside the hippocampus.</p>
<p>However, he did have part</p>
<p>of his posterior hippocampus intact.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the tricky thing.</p>
<p>I think initially, in fact, Scoville, the neurosurgeon,</p>
<p>overestimated the number of millimeters</p>
<p>he intended to remove of the hippocampus.</p>
<p>And then when they did this,</p>
<p>the very historic MRI of H.M. later in his life,</p>
<p>they showed that, in fact,</p>
<p>he did have that posterior hippocampus,</p>
<p>part of the posterior hippocampus intact.</p>
<p>So now it makes it a little bit more complicated</p>
<p>to interpret what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>Not that it was never uncomplicated.</p>
<p>Any interpretation of a lesion in a patient,</p>
<p>as you know, is complicated.</p>
<p>But H.M. had this mythical role</p>
<p>in neuroscience and neurology.</p>
<p>And now it was complicated</p>
<p>because he does have more of the hippocampus intact.</p>
<p>Got it. I did not know that.</p>
<p>There are some memories that can be formed very quickly,</p>
<p>so-called one-trial learning.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m just looking at this list again,</p>
<p>novelty, repetition, association, and emotional resonance.</p>
<p>It seems like some experiences</p>
<p>can bypass the need for multiple repetitions.</p>
<p>Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>And unfortunately, it seems that our nervous system</p>
<p>is skewed toward creating one-trial memories</p>
<p>for negative events,</p>
<p>which has a survival adaptive mechanism.</p>
<p>What is the neural connection that allows that to happen?</p>
<p>Is it the amygdala to hippocampus connection?</p>
<p>I mean, as you and I know,</p>
<p>it seems like every brain area</p>
<p>ultimately is connected to everything else.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a question of through how many nodes,</p>
<p>just like every city is connected to another city.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a question of how many flights and roads</p>
<p>do you have to traverse before you get there.</p>
<p>What is it about one-trial learning?</p>
<p>I mean, at a kind of top contour level,</p>
<p>how can we learn certain things so fast</p>
<p>and other things are tricky?</p>
<p>And now every time I look at this white mug,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s queuing up something special</p>
<p>that simply by virtue of saying it.</p>
<p>So is that one-trial memory?</p>
<p>But what is it about very emotionally salient events</p>
<p>that allow memories to get stamped in?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, I think you&rsquo;ve already alluded to it.</p>
<p>That is, there is this protective function of our brains</p>
<p>that has evolved over the last 2.5 million years</p>
<p>that you need to pay attention</p>
<p>and remember certain things for your survival.</p>
<p>So some things that get stamped in,</p>
<p>you know, they&rsquo;re memories, but they&rsquo;re fear memories.</p>
<p>You know, if I get mugged on the subway</p>
<p>or, you know, there are terrible things</p>
<p>that could happen on the subway as we just learned.</p>
<p>But if something terrible happens,</p>
<p>if something very scary happens,</p>
<p>you remember that and that fear</p>
<p>and that memory of all those things.</p>
<p>I mean, I have one when I lived in Washington, DC,</p>
<p>I went to work at NIH on a Sunday afternoon</p>
<p>and I came back and when I rounded the corner</p>
<p>to my door of my apartment, it was crowbarred in.</p>
<p>Somebody had taken a crowbar, opened up my door</p>
<p>and stole all of the nicest things in my apartment,</p>
<p>which wasn&rsquo;t that nice</p>
<p>because I wasn&rsquo;t making that much money.</p>
<p>But ever since then, whenever I rounded that corner,</p>
<p>I still had that memory.</p>
<p>It was terrible because, you know,</p>
<p>it put me in a terrible state when I was just coming home.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a survival mechanism.</p>
<p>Do you want to be alert to possible danger?</p>
<p>Absolutely, yes.</p>
<p>So part of those one trial memories,</p>
<p>I think is often taking advantage</p>
<p>of this evolutionarily developed system</p>
<p>to tamp in things that could be potentially dangerous</p>
<p>to you into your memory.</p>
<p>So you forever will remember this particular corner</p>
<p>or this hallway</p>
<p>because that is where something really bad happened to you.</p>
<p>It seems like a location.</p>
<p>We talk about conditioned place aversion,</p>
<p>which is just a geek speak for wanting to avoid the place</p>
<p>where something bad happened</p>
<p>or conditioned place preference,</p>
<p>wanting to go back to a place</p>
<p>where something positive happened.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been looking at a photograph</p>
<p>of where you had a wonderful time with somebody</p>
<p>and that can evoke all sorts of positive sensations.</p>
<p>It seems like at some level, as complex as the brain is,</p>
<p>the basic elements of feeling good or feeling lousy</p>
<p>are states within the brain and body.</p>
<p>And linking those to places seems like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a pretty straightforward formula.</p>
<p>Link place to state, link state to place, et cetera,</p>
<p>as your description just provided.</p>
<p>When we learn more complex information,</p>
<p>you know, a poem, a concept,</p>
<p>or we have to ratchet through a set of ideas,</p>
<p>that also involves memory.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure that we&rsquo;ll talk more about this,</p>
<p>but is there any way that you are aware of</p>
<p>that state, bodily state, can be leveraged</p>
<p>to enhance the speed or the quality of memories</p>
<p>and memory formation?</p>
<p>Because, you know, so to be clear about it,</p>
<p>it seems there&rsquo;s something very important</p>
<p>about this fourth, you know,</p>
<p>this emotional resonance component, right?</p>
<p>Novelty, the crowbar into the door is,</p>
<p>thank goodness, sounds like it was novel.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t repeated to me, thank goodness.</p>
<p>So repetition is out,</p>
<p>and the association is very, very strong.</p>
<p>But for people trying to learn information</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re not that excited about,</p>
<p>or that repetition is hard,</p>
<p>or the novelty is simply that it&rsquo;s painful.</p>
<p>Yes, I&rsquo;ve been there, absolutely.</p>
<p>Yeah, as have I.</p>
<p>Is there something that we can do</p>
<p>to leverage knowledge of how the memory system</p>
<p>works naturally to make that a more straightforward process?</p>
<p>So I immediately turn to the things that I&rsquo;ve studied</p>
<p>that you talk about so beautifully on your podcast,</p>
<p>which are strategies generally</p>
<p>to make your brain work better.</p>
<p>I was just reminding myself of your podcast about cold,</p>
<p>because I use that every morning.</p>
<p>Oh, you do cold?</p>
<p>I do, I do.</p>
<p>Just take a moment and just tell us</p>
<p>what is your cold exposure protocol,</p>
<p>then I&rsquo;ll take you back to what you&rsquo;re saying.</p>
<p>So my cold exposure protocol</p>
<p>is at the end of every morning shower that I take,</p>
<p>you know, the shower is warm,</p>
<p>but I give myself a big blast of cold at the end of that.</p>
<p>And it makes me feel so good.</p>
<p>And because I&rsquo;ve been doing it for several years,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so much less painful.</p>
<p>Okay, I admit it was really painful at the beginning,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s much less painful.</p>
<p>I could handle the cold water</p>
<p>and my pipes give nice, really cold water.</p>
<p>And I could feel the awakeness</p>
<p>kind of come up in me after that.</p>
<p>And so, and I miss it if I forget to do it.</p>
<p>But sometimes I run back in</p>
<p>and give myself that cold blast</p>
<p>because it is upping, you know,</p>
<p>I think you talked about this on your podcast,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s happening in the brain?</p>
<p>Basically the cold stimulus, that shock,</p>
<p>that, you know, catching your breath, et cetera,</p>
<p>is adrenaline from the adrenals,</p>
<p>but also from what we understand now,</p>
<p>some new neuroimaging,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s epinephrine and norepinephrine</p>
<p>released from locus coeruleus,</p>
<p>which again is a brain structure in the back of the brain,</p>
<p>sprinklers the rest of the brain</p>
<p>with a kind of a wake up chemical.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a long arc on dopamine release.</p>
<p>This paper back in 2000 showed that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a steady increase up to about 2.5X</p>
<p>of circulating dopamine.</p>
<p>So they weren&rsquo;t looking directly in the brain, admittedly,</p>
<p>but it goes on for four or five hours.</p>
<p>So the improved mood and the feeling of alertness</p>
<p>is a real thing.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>So I use that, I mean,</p>
<p>so basically I use my morning routine.</p>
<p>What is my morning routine?</p>
<p>So when I get up,</p>
<p>I do a 45 minute tea meditation.</p>
<p>So meditating over the brewing and drinking of tea</p>
<p>that I learned from a monk</p>
<p>who has a institute in Taiwan</p>
<p>where he teaches tea meditation.</p>
<p>Love it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve learned all about tea,</p>
<p>different kinds of tea.</p>
<p>And then I do a 30 minute cardio weights workout.</p>
<p>Then I take my shower with the hot cold contrast.</p>
<p>And oh, and before that,</p>
<p>key thing, if I wanna learn something,</p>
<p>and I want to be able to get over</p>
<p>the difficulty of repeating things</p>
<p>or just push myself to do stuff, sleep.</p>
<p>So good, good sleep.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve learned that over the pandemic,</p>
<p>I did sleep experiments on myself</p>
<p>and I learned that I was sleeping an hour less</p>
<p>than I really needed.</p>
<p>So I really need seven and a half to eight hours of sleep</p>
<p>and I was getting six and a half.</p>
<p>And so now, you know,</p>
<p>I get that seven and a half to eight hours</p>
<p>every single night.</p>
<p>And guess what?</p>
<p>I come to different difficult tasks</p>
<p>and I am more willing to give it a try,</p>
<p>to try longer, to try harder.</p>
<p>And my brain works better.</p>
<p>And so I think probably if you go back</p>
<p>to all of your podcasts,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll learn exactly why each one of those things that I do,</p>
<p>which I would bet that you probably do too,</p>
<p>is helping my brain.</p>
<p>I guarantee they are.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m impressed that you do all these things,</p>
<p>although not surprised.</p>
<p>And I should say that the extra hour of sleep</p>
<p>is really impressive and extremely beneficial.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m curious, do you get that in the early part of the night</p>
<p>by going to bed earlier?</p>
<p>Are you-</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Terrific.</p>
<p>And I should just mention,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re too humble to do it,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ll say it again,</p>
<p>that yes, not only are you a full professor</p>
<p>running a tenured full professor</p>
<p>and running a laboratory,</p>
<p>you teach undergraduates,</p>
<p>you have an important role in public education,</p>
<p>multiple books,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re now Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences</p>
<p>at NYU.</p>
<p>So the extra hour of sleep is benefiting you</p>
<p>and as a consequence, benefiting everybody else as well.</p>
<p>Thanks for sharing with us your protocol.</p>
<p>I took you off the trajectory of what one can do,</p>
<p>but I think that people and I appreciate knowing,</p>
<p>you know, kind of what the practical steps are.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Because knowing the science is important,</p>
<p>mechanism I do believe is important</p>
<p>for embedding protocols in people&rsquo;s minds</p>
<p>and why they might want to do them.</p>
<p>But really hearing the mechanics of it is useful.</p>
<p>It sounds like everything together takes about an hour.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not an excessive amount of time,</p>
<p>but it probably gives you an outsized positive effect</p>
<p>on your day.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>I definitely notice it if I&rsquo;m not able to do it.</p>
<p>And when I don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>so I do this seven days a week.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also not just, you know, five days,</p>
<p>seven days a week.</p>
<p>And when I can&rsquo;t do it,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s usually early morning flights or things like that.</p>
<p>And I get over it,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a critical,</p>
<p>critical for the working of my brain.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll just highlight one thing that you said</p>
<p>before we move on, which is that you said when,</p>
<p>sometimes if you get out of the shower before the cold,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll get back in.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s to me,</p>
<p>a really beautiful example of conditioned place preference.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s some,</p>
<p>now the cold shower has become something</p>
<p>that you sort of look forward to.</p>
<p>I should say that nobody is immune</p>
<p>from the adrenaline increase of cold,</p>
<p>no matter how cold,</p>
<p>this is what&rsquo;s interesting about cold.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of the reasons why it&rsquo;s such an important part</p>
<p>of the screening for special operations,</p>
<p>you know, sort of seal teams,</p>
<p>but other branches of military too,</p>
<p>which is that there are very few stimuli</p>
<p>that you can give anyone</p>
<p>and consistently get an adrenaline release from that</p>
<p>without harming them.</p>
<p>You know, with heat,</p>
<p>eventually you need to use so much heat</p>
<p>that you damage tissue.</p>
<p>Or with exercise,</p>
<p>once you exercise, you can damage joints.</p>
<p>You know, and it&rsquo;s this very kind of brilliant,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it was intentional or not,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s sort of an unintentional genius</p>
<p>that special operations has figured out</p>
<p>that by sending people back into the cold over and over,</p>
<p>it never really gets easier.</p>
<p>But over time, people actually start to crave it.</p>
<p>And it provides this reduction in inflammation, et cetera.</p>
<p>So anyway, beautiful practice.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>I want to learn more about your tea meditation</p>
<p>later in the episode.</p>
<p>But in any event,</p>
<p>returning to ways that we can improve memory formation.</p>
<p>Maybe if you would tell us your story around this.</p>
<p>I know you&rsquo;ve told it before,</p>
<p>but like a lot of members of the audience and I</p>
<p>would love to hear how you came to this.</p>
<p>Because growing up in neuroscience,</p>
<p>I knew you as one of the,</p>
<p>I would say one of the three or four,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re all alongside one another,</p>
<p>not, this isn&rsquo;t a hierarchical statement,</p>
<p>three or four top memory researchers in the world.</p>
<p>Textbook material is Suzuki.</p>
<p>My textbooks are filled with the word Suzuki,</p>
<p>your last name, according to the information</p>
<p>on memory and memory formation.</p>
<p>So you were doing that</p>
<p>and doing the things that academics do.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;re still doing that,</p>
<p>but still at a very high level,</p>
<p>but then things took a different direction.</p>
<p>Maybe we could talk about your story</p>
<p>and how you came to the place you are at now,</p>
<p>because I think it provides a number of tools</p>
<p>that people could implement themselves.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>So this story happened as I was working</p>
<p>to get tenure at NYU.</p>
<p>And as you know, it&rsquo;s a stress-filled process.</p>
<p>They give you six years to show your stuff</p>
<p>and you are judged in front of all your colleagues</p>
<p>and either they say, okay, you can join the club</p>
<p>or they say, sorry, you are humiliated</p>
<p>in front of everybody.</p>
<p>This was what was going on.</p>
<p>They actually tell people to leave.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t get tenure, you&rsquo;re gone.</p>
<p>You have to leave your institution.</p>
<p>And so you work really, really hard.</p>
<p>And so my strategy was,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just gonna not do anything but work</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m just gonna work</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m going to just work as hard as I can</p>
<p>for the six years.</p>
<p>And what happens when you work</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t have any sort of life outside of work</p>
<p>and you live in New York</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s all sorts of really good takeout,</p>
<p>you gain 25 pounds, which is exactly what I did.</p>
<p>And you get really, really stressed.</p>
<p>And you start to ask yourself,</p>
<p>how come I&rsquo;m living in New York City and I love Broadway</p>
<p>and I haven&rsquo;t gone to a Broadway show in two years?</p>
<p>And so I, 25 pounds overweight.</p>
<p>I decided to go on vacation</p>
<p>and I went by myself because I had no friends.</p>
<p>And I went to,</p>
<p>I did a adventure river rafting trip in Peru.</p>
<p>And so I go by myself and meet other interesting people.</p>
<p>And I was the weakest person on this whole trip.</p>
<p>Like I was, they were so much in better shape.</p>
<p>It was embarrassing.</p>
<p>And they won&rsquo;t say this.</p>
<p>They won&rsquo;t admit this to me, but it was true.</p>
<p>And I kind of came back and I said,</p>
<p>okay, I cannot be the weakest person.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in my late thirties.</p>
<p>I have to do something.</p>
<p>So I went to the gym and I said,</p>
<p>oh my God, I&rsquo;m 25 pounds overweight.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s try at least to lose this weight.</p>
<p>And so I go to the gym.</p>
<p>I notice how much better I feel</p>
<p>when I go to just a single class.</p>
<p>I remember the very first class I went to</p>
<p>was a hip hop dance class.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a terrible hip hop dancer,</p>
<p>but I still felt good after that class.</p>
<p>And then fast forward year and a half,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve lost the 25 pounds.</p>
<p>So proud of myself, so much happier.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m sitting in my office doing what you and I do a lot,</p>
<p>which is writing an NIH grant,</p>
<p>which is our lifeblood, right?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m writing, writing, writing.</p>
<p>And this thought goes through my mind</p>
<p>that had never gone through my mind before,</p>
<p>which was during this six years of frantic grant writing</p>
<p>when I was trying to get tenure.</p>
<p>And that thought was, grant writing went well today.</p>
<p>That felt good.</p>
<p>I was like, I&rsquo;ve never had that thought before.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s going on here?</p>
<p>This is really weird.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know that anyone has had that thought before.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m sure people have had that thought.</p>
<p>But I thought maybe I&rsquo;m just having a good day.</p>
<p>But when I thought about it, I thought it&rsquo;s not just today.</p>
<p>My grant writing seems to have been getting smoother.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m able to focus longer.</p>
<p>The sessions feel better to me.</p>
<p>And at that point, the only thing that I changed in my life,</p>
<p>it was a huge thing,</p>
<p>but I had become a gym rat rather than a workaholic.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s when my spidey sense for neuroscientists</p>
<p>popped up and I said,</p>
<p>what do we know about the effects of exercise on your brain?</p>
<p>Because if I think about it,</p>
<p>what was better about my writing is</p>
<p>I could focus longer and deeper, very important.</p>
<p>And I could remember those little details</p>
<p>that you try and pull together</p>
<p>for your million dollar NIH grant</p>
<p>from 30 different articles</p>
<p>that you have open on your screen all at the same time.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a hippocampal memory.</p>
<p>I was studying that.</p>
<p>I was writing the grants on hippocampal memory.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s when I got really interested</p>
<p>in the effects of exercise</p>
<p>on both prefrontal focus and attention function</p>
<p>and hippocampal function,</p>
<p>because of my own observation and this kind of,</p>
<p>I still remember where I was sitting,</p>
<p>which office I was in when I had this revelation.</p>
<p>But the thing that really sealed it for me</p>
<p>that made me think not just, oh, this is interesting,</p>
<p>but I wanna study this,</p>
<p>is right around that time,</p>
<p>I got a phone call from my mom</p>
<p>who said that my dad wasn&rsquo;t feeling well</p>
<p>and that he had told her that he got lost</p>
<p>driving back from the 7-Eleven,</p>
<p>which was literally seven blocks from our house</p>
<p>that I grew up in.</p>
<p>And I knew that was hippocampal function.</p>
<p>I suspected dementia.</p>
<p>I suspected, though didn&rsquo;t wanna admit,</p>
<p>Alzheimer&rsquo;s dementia, which he had.</p>
<p>And it was funny because, I mean, it wasn&rsquo;t funny,</p>
<p>but my mom and dad are two sides of a very different coin</p>
<p>my dad is the engineer, not so active all his life,</p>
<p>but loved and sit and read books all day.</p>
<p>My mom was the athlete.</p>
<p>She played tennis, team tennis into her 80s.</p>
<p>And it started to show at that point.</p>
<p>And so then I had even a more pressing reason</p>
<p>to think about what the effects of exercise were,</p>
<p>because I noticed that all the things</p>
<p>that were improving in my brain</p>
<p>suddenly went away in my dad&rsquo;s brain.</p>
<p>Really, really smart guy, engineer in Silicon Valley,</p>
<p>helped that push in Silicon Valley in the 70s happen.</p>
<p>He had no more memory.</p>
<p>He couldn&rsquo;t focus his attention.</p>
<p>His mood was rock bottom.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a very happy guy.</p>
<p>And everything was the opposite in me.</p>
<p>And I started thinking, this isn&rsquo;t just something</p>
<p>to help somebody who wants to get tenure.</p>
<p>This is something that could help millions</p>
<p>and millions of people.</p>
<p>Most importantly, our aging population.</p>
<p>What if, what&rsquo;s happening?</p>
<p>And so the thing that makes me wake up in the morning</p>
<p>is when I realized that every single time</p>
<p>you move your body,</p>
<p>you are releasing a whole bunch of neurochemicals.</p>
<p>And some of them we&rsquo;ve talked about</p>
<p>that the good mood comes from dopamine</p>
<p>and serotonin and noradrenaline.</p>
<p>But the thing that gets released also,</p>
<p>particularly with aerobic exercise,</p>
<p>is a growth factor called</p>
<p>brain-derived neurotrophic factor, or BDNF.</p>
<p>And that is so important because what it does</p>
<p>is it goes directly to your hippocampus</p>
<p>and it helps brand new brain cells grow in your hippocampus.</p>
<p>We all have that.</p>
<p>Even if you&rsquo;re a couch potato,</p>
<p>you can get new brain cells in your hippocampus to grow.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s like giving your hippocampus a boost</p>
<p>with this regular BDNF if you are exercising,</p>
<p>which means that we all have the capacity</p>
<p>to grow a bigger, fatter, fluffier hippocampus.</p>
<p>And so what I like to give people is this image</p>
<p>of every single time you move your body,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like giving your brain this wonderful bubble bath</p>
<p>of neurochemicals.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s going on?</p>
<p>I need my bubble bath of noradrenaline</p>
<p>and dopamine and serotonin and growth factors.</p>
<p>And with regular bubble baths, what am I doing?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m growing a big, fat, fluffy hippocampus.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not gonna cure my father&rsquo;s dementia,</p>
<p>Alzheimer&rsquo;s dementia, but you know what?</p>
<p>If I go into my 70s with a big, fat, fluffy hippocampus,</p>
<p>even if I had that in my genes and it starts to kick in,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna take longer for that disease to start to affect</p>
<p>my ability to form and retain new long-term memories</p>
<p>for facts and events,</p>
<p>which is my motivation for getting up</p>
<p>and doing my 30 to 45 minutes of aerobic exercise every day.</p>
<p>Fantastic.</p>
<p>Quick question about your protocol,</p>
<p>just because, and then we&rsquo;ll discuss</p>
<p>a few mechanistic things related to what signals</p>
<p>the body might be sending the brain</p>
<p>and a little bit more detail on BDNF and some circuitry.</p>
<p>So 30 to 45 minutes,</p>
<p>it sounds like cardiovascular exercise might be special.</p>
<p>But as I say that, and I think about the literature</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m aware of in mice and some in monkeys</p>
<p>and certainly in humans,</p>
<p>looking at the effects of exercise on brain function</p>
<p>and typically the outcome is improvement almost always.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever seen a paper showing that</p>
<p>when animals or humans exercise more</p>
<p>that their brain gets worse.</p>
<p>I just can&rsquo;t think of a single paper.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t mean it doesn&rsquo;t exist.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure someone will put one in the comment section.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll find that one and thank you for,</p>
<p>if you can find that.</p>
<p>But it seems like it&rsquo;s always cardiovascular exercise</p>
<p>and experimentally in a lab,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a lot easier to get a mouse to run on a treadmill</p>
<p>than it is to get a mouse to lift weights.</p>
<p>Although people have put little ankle weights on mice</p>
<p>and the ways of getting mice to do resistance work</p>
<p>is actually a little bit barbaric</p>
<p>because oftentimes they&rsquo;ll incapacitate a limb</p>
<p>to overload another limb.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s an asymmetric thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the same as sending them in to do squats</p>
<p>or deadlifts or something.</p>
<p>So, but cardiovascular exercise might be special.</p>
<p>And what are your thoughts on that?</p>
<p>And please first though, tell us your routine.</p>
<p>Your routine is 30 to 45 minutes of,</p>
<p>are you a Peloton cycler?</p>
<p>Does it matter?</p>
<p>I think that the data suggests that</p>
<p>as long as your heart rate is getting up</p>
<p>for these long-term effects on your hippocampus</p>
<p>and prefrontal cortex,</p>
<p>you also get better at shifting and focusing your attention.</p>
<p>For that, you need cardiovascular.</p>
<p>And what I use is a video workout that I started</p>
<p>even before the pandemic, it&rsquo;s called daily burn.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just thousands of different workouts,</p>
<p>but I love, they are 30 minutes that I sometimes add on</p>
<p>a 10 to 15 minute stretch at the beginning or at the end.</p>
<p>But I love the variety.</p>
<p>Sometimes I do it with weights.</p>
<p>Sometimes I do it without weights.</p>
<p>I love kickboxing.</p>
<p>So they have a lot of kickboxing in there.</p>
<p>It just fits my routine and it&rsquo;s always there.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t have to get all dressed up</p>
<p>to go to the gym to work out.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what I do.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a daily thing, seven days a week.</p>
<p>Seven days a week, fantastic.</p>
<p>So in terms of the way that some of these changes</p>
<p>are being conveyed from the body to the brain,</p>
<p>that fascinates me.</p>
<p>And I mean, as you and I know,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m sort of a repeating record on the podcast,</p>
<p>always saying, you know, you got a brain,</p>
<p>but you also have a spinal cord</p>
<p>and then your nervous system connects everything.</p>
<p>Every organ in your body is basically signaled</p>
<p>to by the nervous system and back to the nervous system,</p>
<p>your spleen, everything.</p>
<p>But so let&rsquo;s imagine your morning routine,</p>
<p>you do your cardiovascular exercise.</p>
<p>Okay, so you&rsquo;re pumping more blood.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the definition of a higher heart rate.</p>
<p>Stroke volume of the heart goes up over time.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re getting fitter.</p>
<p>So blood flow to the brain is increasing.</p>
<p>Do we know how that gets translated to a signal</p>
<p>to release more BDNF?</p>
<p>You know, and then it raises this other question,</p>
<p>which is, does it matter where your mind is</p>
<p>when you exercise?</p>
<p>Because ultimately the brain, of course,</p>
<p>you can anchor your attention to the exercise</p>
<p>or you can be listening to a podcast or something else.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always wondered about this.</p>
<p>Can we enhance the effects of exercise</p>
<p>by combining the enhanced blood flow</p>
<p>with cognitive work during exercise?</p>
<p>Or is it simply a matter of just getting more blood flow</p>
<p>up to the hippocampus?</p>
<p>Yeah, I wish I had the answer to that question too.</p>
<p>My instinct is yes, it matters,</p>
<p>partially because of the work of your colleague,</p>
<p>Aaliyah Crum on mindset and the power of that to change</p>
<p>how physiologically our body is responding.</p>
<p>So how could it not work in her experiments</p>
<p>and not work for my morning or our morning exercise routine?</p>
<p>So, but are there studies point to a study?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know of one.</p>
<p>So exercise neuroscientists out there,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to see that study done.</p>
<p>So yes, it works.</p>
<p>Before I go into the aerobic thing,</p>
<p>I always like to start with the least amount of exercise</p>
<p>to get something really useful</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t want people to say,</p>
<p>oh God, I hate sweating.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna listen anymore.</p>
<p>So I always like to start with studies have shown</p>
<p>that just 10 minutes of walking outside</p>
<p>can shift your mood.</p>
<p>That is part of that neurochemical bubble bath</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re getting dopamine, serotonin, noradrenaline</p>
<p>and anybody can walk for 10 minutes.</p>
<p>And so that is for all of you thinking that out there,</p>
<p>what is the minimum that I could get</p>
<p>some of these brain effects?</p>
<p>10 minutes of walking, anybody can do it.</p>
<p>Is outside important?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a big believer in getting photons into the eyes.</p>
<p>I think that that study was done indoors on a treadmill.</p>
<p>So, and the comparison wasn&rsquo;t done,</p>
<p>but moving your, which is great.</p>
<p>I, you know, some in the middle of the pandemic,</p>
<p>I walked around my apartment for 30 minutes sometimes</p>
<p>just for some variety, felt like a rat on a running wheel,</p>
<p>but yes.</p>
<p>So that minimum amount of movement in your body</p>
<p>can get you those mood effects.</p>
<p>But what about the big, fat, fluffy hippocampus?</p>
<p>What about the better performing prefrontal cortex?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where you start to need the cardio workout.</p>
<p>And from my reading of the literature,</p>
<p>there haven&rsquo;t been enough studies, you know,</p>
<p>directly comparing, contrasting, kickboxing with running,</p>
<p>with whatever other cardio that you need to do.</p>
<p>But any cardio workout that is done</p>
<p>has these positive effects.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m gonna say my interpretation of that</p>
<p>is that whatever way you get your heart rate up,</p>
<p>including a power walk,</p>
<p>a power walk can get your heart rate up,</p>
<p>that is beneficial.</p>
<p>And what is happening,</p>
<p>there are two pathways that have been studied</p>
<p>about how you go from moving your body</p>
<p>to more BDNF, that neurotrophin</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s increasing the growth</p>
<p>of new hippocampal brain cells.</p>
<p>The two pathways are the following.</p>
<p>One is a myokine, which is a protein released</p>
<p>by the muscles, and not your heart.</p>
<p>These are striated muscles in your body.</p>
<p>And so by running, these were studies done in rats</p>
<p>on running wheels.</p>
<p>They showed that the running rats</p>
<p>had more of this myokine release.</p>
<p>The myokine passed the blood-brain barrier,</p>
<p>so it got into the rarefied,</p>
<p>very protected bloodstream of inside the brain.</p>
<p>And that myokine stimulated the release</p>
<p>of BDNF in the brain.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s pathway number one.</p>
<p>Pathway number two comes through the liver</p>
<p>because exercise is a stress generally.</p>
<p>How do we know that?</p>
<p>Well, cortisol is released whenever we exercise.</p>
<p>We need that sugar in our blood,</p>
<p>and so that&rsquo;s how the physiological mechanisms work.</p>
<p>And so there is a ketone, beta-hydroxybutyrate,</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve known for a very long time</p>
<p>that gets released by the liver during exercise.</p>
<p>And we also know that that particular ketone</p>
<p>passes that blood-brain barrier,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s another stimulant for BDNF.</p>
<p>So kind of the final common pathway</p>
<p>seems to be BDNF stimulation in the hippocampus.</p>
<p>Is it the only one?</p>
<p>Probably not, but that&rsquo;s the one</p>
<p>that has been studied most clearly.</p>
<p>So it comes from all of our physiological systems,</p>
<p>our muscles working,</p>
<p>our liver responding to the stress of exercise.</p>
<p>And what is it doing?</p>
<p>It is giving more BDNF precursors to get into our brain</p>
<p>to cause the up-spike of BDNF,</p>
<p>which is part of your bubble bath</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re getting every time you move.</p>
<p>I love that description of a factor from muscle</p>
<p>and a factor from liver,</p>
<p>because anytime we&rsquo;re thinking about movement of the body</p>
<p>and translating that to the brain,</p>
<p>as you so clearly pointed out,</p>
<p>that needs to be,</p>
<p>it needs to traverse the blood-brain barrier.</p>
<p>Not everything that happens in the body</p>
<p>is communicated to the brain.</p>
<p>And these seem like really important signals.</p>
<p>Beta-hydroxybutyrate, you mentioned, is a ketone.</p>
<p>I just want to underscore,</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t mean, folks,</p>
<p>that you need to be on a ketogenic diet.</p>
<p>I think people hear ketone and they think,</p>
<p>I know some people are, most people are not, I imagine.</p>
<p>There are ketones that are released in your brain and body</p>
<p>that can function,</p>
<p>even if you&rsquo;re ingesting carbohydrates and not ketogenic,</p>
<p>just for a point of clarification.</p>
<p>This issue of new neurons is one that you hear a lot.</p>
<p>Neurogenesis, you&rsquo;re going to grow new neurons.</p>
<p>And my understanding is that the rodent literature</p>
<p>is very clear,</p>
<p>that animals that run on wheels more often,</p>
<p>it turns out rodents love to run on wheels.</p>
<p>Do you know these studies by Hoppe-Hofstra,</p>
<p>which are pretty funny?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re very cool, by the way, Hoppe,</p>
<p>Howard Hughes investigator.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not making light of them.</p>
<p>They put running wheels in a field</p>
<p>and wild rodents will run to the running wheel</p>
<p>and run on that running wheel.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s some, they really enjoy it,</p>
<p>which I find amusing for reasons</p>
<p>that probably only a neuroscientist would find amusing.</p>
<p>In any case, in rodents,</p>
<p>it seems that running more on a wheel</p>
<p>can trigger neurogenesis,</p>
<p>literally the birth of new neurons</p>
<p>and the addition of new neurons to the hippocampus.</p>
<p>In monkeys, this has been controversial.</p>
<p>It seems it does happen in the hippocampus</p>
<p>in the olfactory bulb,</p>
<p>probably not in the neocortex,</p>
<p>thinking back to the decades of controversy</p>
<p>between Liz Gould and Pashko Rakesh.</p>
<p>I hope they settled their differences there.</p>
<p>Neuroscientists love to argue.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s what we do.</p>
<p>And in humans, I think it&rsquo;s been a bit controversial.</p>
<p>Some people say absolutely yes.</p>
<p>Other people say absolutely no.</p>
<p>There are new neurons added to the adult brain.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t followed that literature down to the detail,</p>
<p>but I do remember one study</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t think is contested,</p>
<p>which is the work of Rusty Gage at the Salk Institute,</p>
<p>where they actually injected a sort of dye-type marker</p>
<p>into the brains of terminally ill humans</p>
<p>who very graciously offered to have their brains</p>
<p>removed and dissected after death.</p>
<p>And in some cases, very old, terminally ill humans,</p>
<p>they did see evidence for new neurons</p>
<p>being born in the hippocampus.</p>
<p>Can I trust that idea still?</p>
<p>Is that generally accepted?</p>
<p>Well, so after that study, which was quite a while ago,</p>
<p>there are more recent studies, still controversial,</p>
<p>but showing and demonstrating using even new</p>
<p>and better techniques than were used</p>
<p>in that original Rusty Gage study,</p>
<p>which was groundbreaking at the time,</p>
<p>that suggest and I think show</p>
<p>that there are new neurons born in adult human brains</p>
<p>into the ninth decade of life.</p>
<p>So they not only did this,</p>
<p>I think those patients were in their 60s,</p>
<p>then they died of cancer,</p>
<p>but these new studies looking across the timeline,</p>
<p>can we see?</p>
<p>Because the other thing was,</p>
<p>yeah, maybe you have some when you&rsquo;re 20,</p>
<p>but by the time you&rsquo;re older</p>
<p>and you might need these new neurons,</p>
<p>you have no new neuron growth.</p>
<p>And so these studies seem to suggest that yes, yes, you did.</p>
<p>Yes, you do.</p>
<p>And we all do even into old age.</p>
<p>So, yeah.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll just take a moment to say that</p>
<p>I am personally not aware of any studies</p>
<p>looking at other forms of exercise</p>
<p>besides cardiovascular exercise for sake of brain health.</p>
<p>And this I think is an important gap in the literature</p>
<p>that ought to be filled,</p>
<p>whether or not, for instance,</p>
<p>high intensity interval training,</p>
<p>or whether or not weight training,</p>
<p>which has other effects on the musculature.</p>
<p>So you can imagine perhaps the myokine to BDNF pathway,</p>
<p>the pathway one that you mentioned might be signaled,</p>
<p>but maybe not the liver pathway.</p>
<p>Maybe, yes, I&rsquo;m speculating here.</p>
<p>Those studies need to be done.</p>
<p>To my knowledge, they just haven&rsquo;t been done yet,</p>
<p>but they should be done.</p>
<p>If you would,</p>
<p>could you tell us about some of the more specific effects</p>
<p>of exercise on memory?</p>
<p>Memory is a broad category of effects and phenomena.</p>
<p>So things like,</p>
<p>what comes to mind is short-term, medium,</p>
<p>and long-term memory, reaction time.</p>
<p>Learning math, at least for me,</p>
<p>is quite a bit different than learning history.</p>
<p>Although there&rsquo;s certainly overlap</p>
<p>in the neural underpinnings.</p>
<p>What has been demonstrated in the laboratory</p>
<p>in animal models, but especially in humans?</p>
<p>And if you want to share with us any results</p>
<p>from your lab, published or unpublished,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure that the audience</p>
<p>would be delighted to learn about them.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Let me start with kind of the immediate effects,</p>
<p>acute effects as they&rsquo;re called, of exercise on the brain.</p>
<p>So this is asking,</p>
<p>what does a one-off exercise session do for your brain?</p>
<p>And there are three major effects that have been reproduced.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen it in my lab.</p>
<p>Many labs have reproduced this.</p>
<p>So what do you get with a one-off?</p>
<p>This is usually an aerobic type exercise session,</p>
<p>30 to 45 minutes.</p>
<p>What you get is that mood boost, very, very consistent.</p>
<p>You get improved prefrontal function,</p>
<p>typically tested with a stroop test,</p>
<p>which is a test that asks you to shift</p>
<p>and focus your attention in specific ways.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a challenging task</p>
<p>and clearly dependent on the prefrontal cortex, largely.</p>
<p>And significant improvements in reaction time.</p>
<p>So your speed at responding,</p>
<p>often a motor kind of,</p>
<p>but cognitive motor response is improved.</p>
<p>Over the pandemic,</p>
<p>one of the unpublished studies that I did,</p>
<p>looking at the effects of 30 minutes</p>
<p>of age-appropriate workout in subjects</p>
<p>ranging in age from their 20s all the way up to their 90s.</p>
<p>So what are the things that I saw most consistently?</p>
<p>Irrespective of your age,</p>
<p>everybody got a decreased anxiety and depression</p>
<p>and hostility score, which is very important.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not just decreasing your anxiety and depression,</p>
<p>but decreasing your hostility levels.</p>
<p>Making the world a better place.</p>
<p>Making the world a better place.</p>
<p>Energy, the feeling of energy went up.</p>
<p>And what we found is in the older population,</p>
<p>even more than in the younger population,</p>
<p>we saw improved performance on both Stroop</p>
<p>and Erickson-Flanker task,</p>
<p>which is another task dependent on really focusing in</p>
<p>on different letters and paying attention</p>
<p>to what letter is being shown.</p>
<p>So these are consistent effects.</p>
<p>How long do they last?</p>
<p>One of the studies that I did publish in my lab</p>
<p>showed that the immediate effects of exercise</p>
<p>lasted up to two hours.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, that was the longest that we lasted.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re still there at two hours.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a pretty big bang for your buck.</p>
<p>That is.</p>
<p>One 30-minute.</p>
<p>Sorry to interrupt.</p>
<p>I just want to make sure I understand.</p>
<p>So when you say the effects lasted up to two hours,</p>
<p>does that mean up to two hours after you finished exercise</p>
<p>or up to two hours of memory-challenging work?</p>
<p>Yeah, just to be clear.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s a great question.</p>
<p>So my study looked at</p>
<p>two hours after you finish your workout,</p>
<p>we gave you these cognitive tests.</p>
<p>During that two-hour period,</p>
<p>you were free to do anything except exercise or eat.</p>
<p>And so there was no extra load on people.</p>
<p>But two hours later, you did do significantly better</p>
<p>on these focused attention tasks</p>
<p>compared to a group that watched videos</p>
<p>for the exercise period.</p>
<p>This was an hour of cycling that they did.</p>
<p>These were young subjects in their 20s.</p>
<p>Okay, so if I finish my exercise at 9 a.m.,</p>
<p>even if I start this cognitive work,</p>
<p>this mental work at 11, I&rsquo;ll still see benefits.</p>
<p>Yes, at least by 11,</p>
<p>because I didn&rsquo;t go farther than two hours.</p>
<p>So it could last even longer than that.</p>
<p>But I have evidence that it lasts for two hours.</p>
<p>And perhaps if I had started the cognitive work</p>
<p>at 45 minutes after my exercise ended,</p>
<p>it would also be helpful.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s no reason I think that you have to wait</p>
<p>before starting cognitive work.</p>
<p>Yeah, no reason at all.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m asking questions of the sort</p>
<p>that I get in the comments</p>
<p>that we are going to get in the comments section.</p>
<p>We always strive for clarity here.</p>
<p>So what this tells me is that exercising early in the day</p>
<p>may have a special effect.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I realize that some people cannot exercise</p>
<p>until later in the evening.</p>
<p>But you mentioned something earlier</p>
<p>that I want to cue people to.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very, very important.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever mentioned this on the podcast,</p>
<p>which is any kind of physical activity</p>
<p>will increase cortisol to varying degrees.</p>
<p>And so sometimes it&rsquo;s a healthy increase.</p>
<p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s an unhealthy increase</p>
<p>if you do two hours of really intense exercise</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re not prepared for it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a big spike in cortisol.</p>
<p>Probably not a good thing for most people.</p>
<p>But if you are going to do your cardiovascular</p>
<p>or weight training later in the day,</p>
<p>that increase in cortisol</p>
<p>can promote too much wakefulness for sleep, et cetera.</p>
<p>Shifting that cortisol spike early in the day</p>
<p>is associated with a number of important things</p>
<p>related to mood, et cetera.</p>
<p>But more and more, what I&rsquo;m thinking and hearing</p>
<p>is that exercise early in the day is key.</p>
<p>Our former dean of the medical school, Phil Pizzo,</p>
<p>was and is kind of famous still</p>
<p>for jogging between the hours of like four and 5 a.m.</p>
<p>or five and six and then running the medical school.</p>
<p>So, and you&rsquo;re up early doing your exercise</p>
<p>and cold shower and meditation.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll talk about meditation.</p>
<p>But this is more and more of a push,</p>
<p>I feel like, or a stimulus for us to think about</p>
<p>moving our exercise earlier in the day.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, I like to say that,</p>
<p>I know there are moms and dads out there</p>
<p>and they just say, look, I have a kid.</p>
<p>The kid&rsquo;s more important than my doing my exercise.</p>
<p>So you will get benefits if you do it whenever you can.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s great, more power to you.</p>
<p>But what all the neuroscience data suggests</p>
<p>is the best time to do your exercise</p>
<p>is right before you need to use your brain</p>
<p>in the most important way that you need to use it every day.</p>
<p>And so that is why the morning for most of us is beneficial.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I do it in the morning.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m lucky enough to be able to do that.</p>
<p>But yeah, it makes sense with everything we know</p>
<p>about how this works and how it benefits our brain.</p>
<p>I think about our colleague, Eric Kandel,</p>
<p>who not incidentally has a Nobel Prize in studies memory.</p>
<p>And rumor has it that he&rsquo;s been a swimmer for a lot of years</p>
<p>that he&rsquo;ll put in, I think nowadays, he&rsquo;s in his 90s now,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;ll put in half a mile,</p>
<p>but he used to swim a mile a day or something of that sort.</p>
<p>I heard that too, that he was a swimmer</p>
<p>and he does it very, very religiously.</p>
<p>Okay, so there are a few other neuroscientists that do that.</p>
<p>I can think of a lot of neuroscientists</p>
<p>that probably should exercise more.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t say that to poke at them,</p>
<p>I just would love to see them doing their incredible work</p>
<p>for many more decades.</p>
<p>And everything that we&rsquo;re talking about today</p>
<p>indicates that if one doesn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>unless you have incredible genetics,</p>
<p>we all experience age-related dementia, right?</p>
<p>I mean, the story of your father is a salient one</p>
<p>and we should remember that as we go forward.</p>
<p>But I also wanna emphasize,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to get your thoughts on just memory</p>
<p>and memory loss in general.</p>
<p>It seems we all get worse at remembering and learning things</p>
<p>even if we don&rsquo;t get Alzheimer&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>When does that typically start for humans?</p>
<p>You know, I think there&rsquo;s so much variability,</p>
<p>not only because we are individuals,</p>
<p>but because our stress levels are different.</p>
<p>And, well, everybody&rsquo;s anxiety level has gone up</p>
<p>in the last couple of years, but that also has an effect.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t remember as much in a highly stressful,</p>
<p>highly anxious situation.</p>
<p>So, as you know, it&rsquo;s hard to answer that question.</p>
<p>People say, okay,</p>
<p>just tell me how much exercise I have to do.</p>
<p>Okay, just-</p>
<p>30 to 40 minutes a day, but I love the per day.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been doing this whole thing of telling people,</p>
<p>oh, the data say 150 to 200 minutes of zone two cardio,</p>
<p>which is kind of moderately hard, but not excessively hard.</p>
<p>But I love this every day theme</p>
<p>because whenever I do that, the questions that come back are,</p>
<p>well, what if I take a long hike on the weekends?</p>
<p>And so people start negotiating.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s very powerful</p>
<p>about non-negotiable every day.</p>
<p>Sun in your eyes every day, even through cloud cover.</p>
<p>Exercise for 30, 45 minutes.</p>
<p>Cold shower every day.</p>
<p>Every day, yeah.</p>
<p>You know, my understanding of the literature</p>
<p>is that somewhere in our 50s or 60s,</p>
<p>we start noticing little hiccups in memory.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>For some people younger, for some people later.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But I have to imagine that doing the exercise</p>
<p>throughout one&rsquo;s entire life</p>
<p>is going to help offset some of this,</p>
<p>simply because of the BDNF and other downstream effects.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, I mean, that&rsquo;s what it suggests.</p>
<p>One of my favorite studies,</p>
<p>and then I want to get back to,</p>
<p>you wanted, you invited me to share</p>
<p>some of my unpublished data</p>
<p>on the effects of long-term exercise.</p>
<p>But first I want to share one of my favorite studies,</p>
<p>which is a longitudinal study done in Swedish women.</p>
<p>And this was published in 2018.</p>
<p>And what they did was, back in the 1960s,</p>
<p>they found Swedish women,</p>
<p>300 Swedish women in their 40s.</p>
<p>And they characterized them as low-fit, mid-fit, high-fit.</p>
<p>Okay?</p>
<p>And then 40 years later,</p>
<p>they came back and found these women.</p>
<p>They let them live their lives.</p>
<p>And they asked what happened to these women</p>
<p>as a function of whether they were low-fit, mid-fit,</p>
<p>high-fit in their 40s.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re now in their 80s.</p>
<p>And what they found was that,</p>
<p>relative to the low-fit or mid-fit women,</p>
<p>the women that were high-fit</p>
<p>gained nine more years of good cognition later in life.</p>
<p>Now, this is not a randomized control study.</p>
<p>This is a correlational study.</p>
<p>But does it agree with everything</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve been talking about today?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Does it agree with this idea that, you know,</p>
<p>the women that were high-fit were giving their brains</p>
<p>this bubble bath, you know, maybe not every day,</p>
<p>but very, very regularly for that entire 40 years.</p>
<p>And that built up.</p>
<p>That beautiful hippocampi, yes, it does.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s one of my favorite studies.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Another cause for getting the exercise in consistently.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Yeah, I am impressed by this 10-minute walk</p>
<p>and the improvements in mood from just a 10-minute walk.</p>
<p>But again, I think that daily repetition,</p>
<p>also, I have to imagine,</p>
<p>has effects on the very pathways that allow plasticity.</p>
<p>This is something we, in the realm of neuroplasticity,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t often hear about or think about,</p>
<p>even as neuroscientists,</p>
<p>which is that the pathways for engaging in plasticity</p>
<p>probably can be, probably, I&rsquo;m speculating here,</p>
<p>can be made better by engaging in the sorts of behavior</p>
<p>that stimulate plasticity.</p>
<p>In other words, if one gets better</p>
<p>at calming themselves down under stress,</p>
<p>those circuits get better at doing that, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a, neural circuits gain proficiency.</p>
<p>Because blood vessels can grow,</p>
<p>capillaries can grow in the brain,</p>
<p>you can imagine that more pumping of blood to the brain,</p>
<p>delivery of these various muscle and liver factors</p>
<p>would also establish larger or more efficient portals</p>
<p>to getting that stuff there.</p>
<p>So you could imagine a kind of an amplifying effect</p>
<p>of exercise.</p>
<p>And again, I&rsquo;m speculating here,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve seen this over and over again in colleagues.</p>
<p>The ones who exercise consistently</p>
<p>seem to be really, really smart and doing amazing work</p>
<p>well into their 80s and 90s.</p>
<p>And the ones who aren&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>some of whom actually pride themselves</p>
<p>on how little they exercise,</p>
<p>they get worse over time.</p>
<p>You see them each meeting each decade</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m not poking fun at them at all.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually quite hard to see.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re kind of a fading light.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re starting to flicker.</p>
<p>So there is this incredible relationship</p>
<p>between body vitality and brain vitality.</p>
<p>That is, of course, is not an excuse</p>
<p>to be running all day in the gym, right?</p>
<p>The gym rats, I enjoy working out.</p>
<p>So I could imagine doing that,</p>
<p>but that doesn&rsquo;t make us smarter, unfortunately.</p>
<p>You actually have to do the cognitive work also, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just exercise.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;d love to hear about some of these new unpublished data.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Okay, so when I jumped into the exercise work,</p>
<p>everybody was studying people 65 or older</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s when cognitive decline begins.</p>
<p>And if the idea is exercise can help you</p>
<p>with your cognition, then makes sense.</p>
<p>However, I thought, well, you know, it&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s lots of work there.</p>
<p>I wanted to know what happens in people</p>
<p>in their 40s and their 50s,</p>
<p>maybe even their 30s and their 20s.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because that&rsquo;s when we as humans are able,</p>
<p>ready, willing and able to increase our exercise</p>
<p>and gets us set up to build our brains</p>
<p>as we go into our 60s.</p>
<p>And so the first study that I did looked</p>
<p>at low fit participants from their 30s to mid 50s.</p>
<p>And we wanted to ask this question,</p>
<p>how much exercise do you really need</p>
<p>to start seeing benefits?</p>
<p>Do you see benefits?</p>
<p>Or maybe you have to wait</p>
<p>until you start seeing cognitive decline to get benefits.</p>
<p>That was one of the theories out there.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s what I wanted to do.</p>
<p>And so what we did was three months</p>
<p>of two to three times a week cardio.</p>
<p>It was a spin class.</p>
<p>So spin classes are great for cardio.</p>
<p>And the comparison group was two to three times a week</p>
<p>of competitive video scrabble.</p>
<p>So no heart rate change,</p>
<p>but they had to come into my lab</p>
<p>and be in a group just like they were in a group</p>
<p>for the spin class.</p>
<p>We tested them cognitively</p>
<p>at the beginning of the end of the session.</p>
<p>What we found was two to three times a week of cardio.</p>
<p>In these people, they were low fit,</p>
<p>which means specifically that they were exercising</p>
<p>less than 30 minutes a week</p>
<p>for the three months previous to the experiment.</p>
<p>So they went from that</p>
<p>to two to three times a week of spin class.</p>
<p>And what we found was changes in baseline rates</p>
<p>of their positive mood states went up</p>
<p>relative to the video scrabble group.</p>
<p>Their body image got more positive</p>
<p>because they were exercising, which is great.</p>
<p>And really important,</p>
<p>their motivation to exercise went up significantly</p>
<p>compared to the video scrabble group, which is great.</p>
<p>So the more you exercise,</p>
<p>the more motivated you are to exercise.</p>
<p>What about cognition?</p>
<p>What changed in the cognitive circuits of their brain?</p>
<p>Number one, we got improved performance on the Stroop task,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re headed towards my favorite structure,</p>
<p>which is the hippocampus.</p>
<p>What we found was improved performance</p>
<p>on both a recognition memory task,</p>
<p>which was a memory encoding task,</p>
<p>and that is, can you differentiate similar items</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re asking you to remember?</p>
<p>And spatial episodic memory task,</p>
<p>where we had them play one of those Doom-like games</p>
<p>when they went into this spatial maze</p>
<p>and they had to do things in a virtual city.</p>
<p>Their performance there got better,</p>
<p>which is very, very classically dependent</p>
<p>on the hippocampus.</p>
<p>So this, it was so satisfying to do this study</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ve been wanting to answer this question.</p>
<p>What is a minimum amount</p>
<p>or doable amount of exercise</p>
<p>that will get you these cognitive benefits?</p>
<p>And now I can say, in 30 to 50-year-olds</p>
<p>that are low fit two to three times a week,</p>
<p>is that doable?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Will it be hard if you&rsquo;re low fit?</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s gonna be challenging, but absolutely doable.</p>
<p>And so that is, it makes sense</p>
<p>with all of the mechanisms that we are,</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t study the mechanisms, just to be clear,</p>
<p>but with all the mechanisms we are imagining</p>
<p>are playing a role here, that absolutely makes sense.</p>
<p>And it is doable.</p>
<p>This is not like you have to become marathon runner</p>
<p>to get any of these benefits.</p>
<p>This is, you have to start moving your body</p>
<p>on a regular basis, two to three times a week.</p>
<p>And so I love that for its realness.</p>
<p>How long are those sessions again?</p>
<p>45 minutes.</p>
<p>45 minutes.</p>
<p>45 minutes, it&rsquo;s a typical spin kind of class.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a warmup for five minutes</p>
<p>and a cool down for five minutes.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s really 35 minutes.</p>
<p>35 minutes of, you know, they&rsquo;re really pushing you.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And so they&rsquo;re breathing reasonably hard.</p>
<p>Heart rate is up.</p>
<p>Heart rate is definitely up, yeah.</p>
<p>I find that all of those results are really interesting.</p>
<p>The result showing improvement in motivation to exercise</p>
<p>is interesting, because it gets back to this issue</p>
<p>of kind of a self-amplifying effect.</p>
<p>And the neuroscientist in me wants to think about</p>
<p>kind of pre-motor circuits and the fact that,</p>
<p>you know, we have a motor system that can obviously</p>
<p>do things like lift cups and walk and run</p>
<p>if we want to or need to,</p>
<p>but that it&rsquo;s possible to create a kind of anticipatory</p>
<p>activity in our nervous system,</p>
<p>where our body craves a certain stimulus.</p>
<p>You mentioned the cold and how you crave the cold.</p>
<p>Now, whether or not that&rsquo;s the adrenaline</p>
<p>and the dopamine, et cetera,</p>
<p>or whether or not somebody who exercises</p>
<p>started going from zero, less than 30 minutes per week</p>
<p>to two to three times a week, 45 minutes,</p>
<p>as you described for this study.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had that experience before of,</p>
<p>if I&rsquo;m, the cardio that I tend to battle the most,</p>
<p>and I love lifting heavy objects, at least heavy for me,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m happy to go to the gym every other day</p>
<p>and just lift heavy objects for an hour.</p>
<p>It just makes me happy.</p>
<p>I like the way it feels.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve been doing it since I was in my teens,</p>
<p>so 30 years.</p>
<p>Cardio is a little bit trickier.</p>
<p>I like to run, but if I stop running for a little while,</p>
<p>I find it very hard to get back into.</p>
<p>But if I start running three times a week</p>
<p>for 30 to 45 minutes and I do this pretty consistently</p>
<p>on the days I don&rsquo;t weight train,</p>
<p>I find that I start to crave it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost as if my body needs that in order to,</p>
<p>I always say clear out the cobwebs,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s like if my mind doesn&rsquo;t function as well,</p>
<p>clearly now I understand why and why exercise helps.</p>
<p>But also my, physically,</p>
<p>I almost feel like my body needs to engage in that movement.</p>
<p>Like the pre-motor circuits are kind of revving,</p>
<p>kind of like revving the engine on your car</p>
<p>while it&rsquo;s in park.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>So the motivation to exercise</p>
<p>obviously could be multifaceted.</p>
<p>It could be purely psychological.</p>
<p>But do you think there&rsquo;s any reason to speculate at least</p>
<p>or believe that we can build an anticipatory,</p>
<p>reverberatory activity into our nervous system?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>You know, I agree with that</p>
<p>because I also have those same kinds of thoughts</p>
<p>and I do have anticipatory exercise when I can&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>So I just got back from a week and a half in Paris</p>
<p>where I got to do a book launch of my last book,</p>
<p>Good Anxiety.</p>
<p>And I really, I walked around a lot</p>
<p>but I did not do my exercise for that whole week and a half.</p>
<p>And, but there was a lot of stress</p>
<p>because I had to do all these interviews in French.</p>
<p>So I gave myself a break.</p>
<p>You speak French?</p>
<p>I speak French, yes.</p>
<p>I was gonna say, otherwise it would be really stressful.</p>
<p>Yes, that would be really stressful.</p>
<p>Then I&rsquo;d be really impressed.</p>
<p>Then I would definitely start exercising.</p>
<p>Actually, I would follow your morning routine to a T</p>
<p>but okay, very impressive nonetheless.</p>
<p>But I got back and, you know,</p>
<p>coming back this direction from Paris,</p>
<p>I live in New York, is much easier.</p>
<p>And so I was able to get up at a normal time the next day.</p>
<p>And that exercise session, that first day,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, okay, I&rsquo;m back in my home.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m back in my environment.</p>
<p>And it felt so good.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, I wanted to come back.</p>
<p>And I know it&rsquo;s because I worked up over years.</p>
<p>Now I could truthfully say seven days a week,</p>
<p>but it was, you know, first it was four to five,</p>
<p>then it was five to six.</p>
<p>And yeah, seven, but that includes a yoga day</p>
<p>or sometimes I have to do it for 10 minutes</p>
<p>instead of 30 because I have to leave.</p>
<p>But that habit of you do that, even for five minutes,</p>
<p>you do either the weight 10 minute thing</p>
<p>or a five minute thing or a stretch.</p>
<p>That is a tiny habit.</p>
<p>Is that somebody at Stanford</p>
<p>that invented this idea of tiny habits?</p>
<p>I thought it was.</p>
<p>Well, we&rsquo;ve got a number of people there.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s, and I apologize in advance</p>
<p>to all the people I neglect in this statement,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m happy to put it in the comments, folks.</p>
<p>BJ Fogg is there, has done.</p>
<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s who I.</p>
<p>Yeah, BJ has done really great work.</p>
<p>And then James Clear wrote a book about habits</p>
<p>and has a very popular newsletter about habits.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve done an episode about habits</p>
<p>that cover some of their work</p>
<p>and some of the more laboratory-ish,</p>
<p>not ish, laboratory science, peer-reviewed work on it.</p>
<p>Daily behaviors, also daily behaviors performed</p>
<p>at roughly the same time of day.</p>
<p>I mean, one thing we know for sure</p>
<p>is that the circadian system</p>
<p>is part of our nervous system&rsquo;s way of anticipating</p>
<p>when things will happen, not just what will happen.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m telling you things you obviously know already,</p>
<p>but for the audience performing your exercise</p>
<p>at roughly the same time each day will make it easier.</p>
<p>As opposed to just saying,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna do it seven days a week sometime today.</p>
<p>But of course, getting it done sometime</p>
<p>is better than not getting it done.</p>
<p>Yes, absolutely, absolutely.</p>
<p>Well, those are impressive effects.</p>
<p>And I love that you&rsquo;re starting to look in populations</p>
<p>that are a bit younger,</p>
<p>not because some of these older populations aren&rsquo;t important</p>
<p>but I think that building good habits</p>
<p>in across one&rsquo;s entire life is really what it&rsquo;s about.</p>
<p>As I always say, with anything related to longevity</p>
<p>or offsetting an age-related decline,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t know, it&rsquo;s hard to know if things work</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s no within-subject control.</p>
<p>But what we also know for sure</p>
<p>is that you don&rsquo;t want to be the control experiment.</p>
<p>Right, exactly.</p>
<p>You absolutely don&rsquo;t want to be the control experiment,</p>
<p>especially for something that&rsquo;s purely behavioral.</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;re not talking about</p>
<p>ingesting a particular supplement.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not talking about changing your diet in any way.</p>
<p>But I am curious,</p>
<p>do, you know, diet is a very barbed wire topic</p>
<p>on the internet,</p>
<p>which diets, whether or not they work, et cetera.</p>
<p>But in general, in any of these studies,</p>
<p>do they evaluate whether or not</p>
<p>people change their eating habits</p>
<p>when they start to exercise more?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think I&rsquo;ve seen one study that controlled for that</p>
<p>but I feel for them because it&rsquo;s hard enough</p>
<p>to get people to exercise at the level</p>
<p>and at the time that you need for your study.</p>
<p>If you also ask them,</p>
<p>okay, fill out this survey</p>
<p>to tell us exactly what you ate all day,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna say, forget you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not joining your study.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a critical question.</p>
<p>And again, there&rsquo;s only been one that I&rsquo;ve seen.</p>
<p>And the evidence was that diets got better</p>
<p>when they, you know, less processed foods</p>
<p>when they did adhere to this exercise.</p>
<p>But a lot more information needs to be gathered</p>
<p>in that realm.</p>
<p>The second study that I wanted to share,</p>
<p>unpublished, we&rsquo;re writing it up right now,</p>
<p>is part two of that study that I just described,</p>
<p>which was the low-fit people.</p>
<p>Next, we moved to mid-fit people.</p>
<p>Like, what about us?</p>
<p>You know, we&rsquo;re already exercising.</p>
<p>How am I gonna benefit from increasing my exercise?</p>
<p>So here again, we collaborated with a great spin studio</p>
<p>that had a whole bunch of mid-fit people</p>
<p>that, by our definition, were exercising</p>
<p>two to three times a week on a regular basis.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>All you people out there that are doing that,</p>
<p>you should know you&rsquo;re already benefiting your brain.</p>
<p>But our question was, what if we invited them</p>
<p>to exercise as much as they wanted at the spin studio</p>
<p>for three months, from, you know, two to three times,</p>
<p>all the way up to seven times a week?</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s just see what happened.</p>
<p>And the control group,</p>
<p>we asked them not to change their exercise.</p>
<p>And so what we ended up with was a nice big array</p>
<p>of starting with mid-fit people</p>
<p>that exercise between staying at two to three times a week</p>
<p>all the way up to seven times a week.</p>
<p>And the bottom line from that study</p>
<p>is every drop of sweat counted.</p>
<p>That is, the more you change</p>
<p>and you increase your workout up to seven times a week,</p>
<p>the better your mood was.</p>
<p>You had lower amounts of depression and anxiety,</p>
<p>higher amounts of good affect,</p>
<p>and the better your hippocampal memory was</p>
<p>with the more you worked out.</p>
<p>Again, this was for three months.</p>
<p>So I love that too, because it gives power</p>
<p>to those of us that are, you know, regularly exercising</p>
<p>and wondering, do I really need to,</p>
<p>I mean, is it really gonna help me?</p>
<p>And the answer is yes.</p>
<p>Not all of us can exercise,</p>
<p>go to a spin class seven times a week.</p>
<p>But I love the message that our body is responsive to that.</p>
<p>And you can get better hippocampal function,</p>
<p>better overall baseline mood affect with a higher level.</p>
<p>So it works for the mid-fit people as well.</p>
<p>Fantastic.</p>
<p>The more I learned from you,</p>
<p>the more I&rsquo;m starting to conceptualize the brain</p>
<p>as an organ that is privileged in so many ways.</p>
<p>You know, it has this unique blood brain barrier,</p>
<p>has this incredible quality of being able to predict things.</p>
<p>And its job mainly is, of course,</p>
<p>to predict things among other functions, of course.</p>
<p>But that our brain isn&rsquo;t necessarily going to stay stable</p>
<p>or get better over time, that it needs a signal.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That it isn&rsquo;t sufficient to just say</p>
<p>that we can&rsquo;t take it for granted,</p>
<p>that our brain is actually an organ</p>
<p>that requires a signal</p>
<p>in order to maintain its own function.</p>
<p>And it sounds like enhanced blood flow</p>
<p>and these pathways that you described earlier,</p>
<p>these two pathways,</p>
<p>are at least among the more critical signals.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m tempted now to move my frequency</p>
<p>of cardiovascular exercise from,</p>
<p>I confess it&rsquo;s about three days, 35 minutes lately,</p>
<p>and it should be more, to daily.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something really, again, really special about daily</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s non-negotiable, you just do it.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And it sounds like if one were to do</p>
<p>higher intensity exercise,</p>
<p>you know, in a spin class,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never taken a spin class,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve seen there are times when they&rsquo;re standing up</p>
<p>on the bike and pedaling very hard.</p>
<p>So that is included in these kinds of workouts, right?</p>
<p>Absolutely, yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s what the instructor is doing.</p>
<p>I cannot control.</p>
<p>We did monitor heart rate of all the subjects.</p>
<p>And it was clearly, compared to the video Scrabble,</p>
<p>it was highly significant.</p>
<p>I would hope so.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I guess it depends on how intense that game of Scrabble is.</p>
<p>Could we just briefly talk about mindset and affirmations?</p>
<p>Yeah, sure.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve talked a bit before about affirmations.</p>
<p>And as you mentioned the beautiful work</p>
<p>of my colleague at Stanford, Aaliyah Crum,</p>
<p>and we can summarize her work pretty simply,</p>
<p>although we won&rsquo;t do it complete justice by it.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s already been on the podcast.</p>
<p>Just to say that one&rsquo;s beliefs about a behavior</p>
<p>also impact the outcomes of that behavior.</p>
<p>If you learn a lot of true facts</p>
<p>about stress being good for you,</p>
<p>then you will experience stress as better for you</p>
<p>than if you only focus on or learn</p>
<p>about the negative effects of stress.</p>
<p>If you learn about the positive effects of exercise,</p>
<p>you actually derive greater benefit from exercise,</p>
<p>believe it or not.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s incredible, incredible effects,</p>
<p>but they make sense when you understand</p>
<p>what the brain is doing,</p>
<p>which is a lot of this predictive coding</p>
<p>and mindsets don&rsquo;t seem as mysterious</p>
<p>anymore once you understand what the brain is really doing.</p>
<p>But what is, if any, the value of affirmation,</p>
<p>of telling yourself something positive</p>
<p>about yourself or of exercise on not the exercise itself,</p>
<p>but on mood, self-image, memory, and brain function?</p>
<p>Yeah, so I looked into this</p>
<p>because I am also a certified exercise instructor</p>
<p>and the form of exercise that I teach</p>
<p>is called Intensati,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s a form of exercise</p>
<p>that was developed by this amazing fitness instructor,</p>
<p>Patricia Moreno, and she combined physical movements</p>
<p>from kickbox and dance and yoga and martial arts</p>
<p>with positive spoken affirmations.</p>
<p>So each move, if you&rsquo;re punching back and forth</p>
<p>as you would do in a kickbox class,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t just punch,</p>
<p>you say something like, I am strong now,</p>
<p>which every punch is associated with a word.</p>
<p>And you can create your own series of affirmations</p>
<p>with the moves that you put together.</p>
<p>And the first time I did it,</p>
<p>I just wandered into her class, I didn&rsquo;t know what it was,</p>
<p>and I felt idiotic.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, I came into the wrong class,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna come into this class.</p>
<p>But then I saw they didn&rsquo;t care</p>
<p>whether I thought they looked silly,</p>
<p>saying these affirmations,</p>
<p>not saying, yelling these affirmations out loud</p>
<p>while doing the choreography at the same time.</p>
<p>And then I tried it.</p>
<p>Okay, I didn&rsquo;t yell out,</p>
<p>I kind of whispered it at first.</p>
<p>But by the end, I was really yelling it out.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something about the declaration,</p>
<p>using your own voice,</p>
<p>of saying things that you don&rsquo;t often say to yourself,</p>
<p>like, I&rsquo;m strong, I&rsquo;m inspired, I believe I will succeed,</p>
<p>are all the kinds of affirmations you say.</p>
<p>And you walk out of that class,</p>
<p>or I walked out of that class,</p>
<p>thinking, oh, I feel really good now, man,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t wait to come back to this class,</p>
<p>which is why I ultimately took teacher training</p>
<p>to be able to teach that class.</p>
<p>And so I started to look into</p>
<p>what was known about affirmations.</p>
<p>And they were never combined with physical activity,</p>
<p>but it was clear that there was a literature</p>
<p>showing that positive affirmations,</p>
<p>saying them or reading them,</p>
<p>could change mood in the same way</p>
<p>as we&rsquo;re talking about Aaliyah Crumb&rsquo;s work.</p>
<p>If you have this, it&rsquo;s a belief.</p>
<p>Once you start saying these things,</p>
<p>these are not difficult things to believe,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s amazing how much you don&rsquo;t say</p>
<p>these kinds of things to yourself or with your own voice.</p>
<p>You might say them about somebody else.</p>
<p>Oh, you&rsquo;re strong, you&rsquo;re so smart.</p>
<p>Do you say that about yourself?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the thing about the self affirmations.</p>
<p>It really gets you into a habit</p>
<p>of saying good things about yourself.</p>
<p>And then you start to realize,</p>
<p>oh my God, I&rsquo;m so mean to myself.</p>
<p>I have lots of negative thoughts going on</p>
<p>about myself in my head,</p>
<p>and which was part of the other reason</p>
<p>why I loved this particular form of exercise.</p>
<p>So what you get in Tensati is the mood boost</p>
<p>from the positive spoken affirmations</p>
<p>together with all the other brain and affect boosts</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve been talking about</p>
<p>for this whole podcast from the exercise,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a sweaty workout as well.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a book, I confess I haven&rsquo;t read it,</p>
<p>but I have had the pleasure of having a discussion</p>
<p>with a psychologist from,</p>
<p>I believe he&rsquo;s at University of Michigan in Ann Arbor,</p>
<p>Ethan Cross wrote a book called Chatter,</p>
<p>which focuses on the fact that</p>
<p>so much of our inner dialogue, it is indeed negative.</p>
<p>He certainly wasn&rsquo;t the first to point that out,</p>
<p>but that explicit statements to counter</p>
<p>that negative chatter, I believe,</p>
<p>is one of the hallmarks of readjusting one&rsquo;s own,</p>
<p>not just internal reference frame,</p>
<p>but actually self-image generally.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a fascinating and I think a very important area</p>
<p>of psychology and neuroscience,</p>
<p>because, and I acknowledge this,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re talking about this too,</p>
<p>laboratory neuroscientists who record from neurons</p>
<p>and label neurons and look at stuff down the microscope,</p>
<p>we are now deep in the territory,</p>
<p>in the deep water of what some of our colleagues</p>
<p>and people who think about neuroscience would consider</p>
<p>like really out there on the kind of subjective edges.</p>
<p>And yet I think it&rsquo;s worth pointing out</p>
<p>that the brain does all these things.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s responsible for simple reflexes and motor behaviors,</p>
<p>but also high-level conceptual ideas about the universe</p>
<p>and what it might look like in 10 years</p>
<p>or a hundred years or a thousand years,</p>
<p>but also high-level conceptual understanding</p>
<p>of who we are and what we are about.</p>
<p>And so even though it might seem a little bit out</p>
<p>on the fringes, dare I say,</p>
<p>I think that these are some of the more important</p>
<p>untried landscapes of neuroscience.</p>
<p>And I just wanna acknowledge my appreciation</p>
<p>for the fact that I&rsquo;m gonna connect the dots here</p>
<p>and say, you went from somebody who didn&rsquo;t exercise,</p>
<p>who went on this rafting trip,</p>
<p>that discovered exercise and its benefits</p>
<p>for your grant writing and then on and on and on,</p>
<p>and then became a certified instructor.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t do anything halfway either as it&rsquo;s clear.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to touch on something you mentioned earlier,</p>
<p>but we haven&rsquo;t dove into it all in any depth,</p>
<p>which is meditation.</p>
<p>You mentioned this tea meditation.</p>
<p>You had a publication recently</p>
<p>on a 10-minute meditation, right?</p>
<p>Maybe you could tell us about this 10-minute meditation.</p>
<p>It seems like such a tractable amount of time.</p>
<p>And then if you would,</p>
<p>maybe tell us a little bit about the tea meditation,</p>
<p>but it sounds like you&rsquo;ve discovered</p>
<p>a close to minimum threshold of meditation</p>
<p>that can really benefit us.</p>
<p>Maybe you could tell us about that study.</p>
<p>So the study was, as you very astutely pointed out,</p>
<p>very practical study, just 10 minutes,</p>
<p>not 30 minutes, not an hour meditation.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s too hard.</p>
<p>10 minutes guided meditation.</p>
<p>They logged into a site,</p>
<p>so we can tell that they logged in</p>
<p>and they listened to a, it&rsquo;s a body scan,</p>
<p>very basic, but easy to follow kind of meditation.</p>
<p>And we asked them to do it, how often?</p>
<p>Daily, seven days a week, just 10 minutes a day.</p>
<p>And the most shocking thing about this study</p>
<p>is that we got more adherence</p>
<p>to the 10-minute daily meditation</p>
<p>than the 10-minute daily podcast listening,</p>
<p>which was our control.</p>
<p>So the highest retention rate I&rsquo;ve ever gotten</p>
<p>in any this kind of study</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve done exercise or meditation,</p>
<p>they wanted to do it 10 minutes a day.</p>
<p>It was great.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna just start leading meditations</p>
<p>for three hours as opposed to doing a three-hour podcast.</p>
<p>So we looked at cognitive effects</p>
<p>before and after this.</p>
<p>It was eight weeks of daily,</p>
<p>it was actually 12-minute meditation,</p>
<p>12 minutes of body scan meditation.</p>
<p>And what we found was significant decreases</p>
<p>in stress response.</p>
<p>So we did the Stryer stress test</p>
<p>to see how you responded</p>
<p>to an unexpected stressful situation.</p>
<p>The meditators did much better.</p>
<p>Their mood was better</p>
<p>and their cognitive performance was also better.</p>
<p>And this was my first little foray into meditation</p>
<p>after I had started my personal tea meditation</p>
<p>that really shifted my relationship with meditation.</p>
<p>And, but it&rsquo;s consistent with many other studies</p>
<p>showing the beneficial effects of meditation.</p>
<p>But the unique thing was we tried to make it doable</p>
<p>that many, many people out there</p>
<p>could actually follow this typical regimen.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;re continuing that.</p>
<p>In fact, my research in my lab right now</p>
<p>is all about those doable, short things</p>
<p>that NYU college students will do,</p>
<p>not just at the beginning of the semester,</p>
<p>but at the end of the semester,</p>
<p>when the stress and anxiety levels</p>
<p>are now at record breaking high levels</p>
<p>and they need something to bring that level down</p>
<p>so that they could show their professors</p>
<p>what their brains can actually do.</p>
<p>And so it includes very short meditations,</p>
<p>sound meditations, visual meditations, walking,</p>
<p>things that any college student,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re obviously focused on NYU students, will do too.</p>
<p>And I want to get at graduation rates.</p>
<p>I want to get at class performance</p>
<p>with these kinds of interventions.</p>
<p>But it started with that study</p>
<p>that I just described, meditation.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>If you would, and here&rsquo;s where we can highlight this again</p>
<p>as some highly educated speculation that&rsquo;s coming from you.</p>
<p>What do you think is going on during meditation?</p>
<p>I mean, so a body skin involves</p>
<p>a kind of an interoceptive awareness,</p>
<p>like interoception of course being an attention</p>
<p>to what&rsquo;s going on on the surface of</p>
<p>and within the confines of our skin</p>
<p>as opposed to the outside world.</p>
<p>Drawing our attention to anything inside us or outside us</p>
<p>involves forebrain function, prefrontal cortex,</p>
<p>presumably, and other things.</p>
<p>Typically, eyes are closed.</p>
<p>Typically, it&rsquo;s relaxing.</p>
<p>So there are a lot of variables that could be feeding</p>
<p>into a number of different effects.</p>
<p>But as a neuroscientist,</p>
<p>what do you think is going on that this period</p>
<p>of kind of a self-induced, somewhat unusual state,</p>
<p>what do you think is going on in terms of network behavior</p>
<p>and networks within the brain</p>
<p>that it can have these long-term effects?</p>
<p>Because we got to some of the ones</p>
<p>who relate downstream of exercise.</p>
<p>And I think there&rsquo;s so much evidence,</p>
<p>I know there&rsquo;s so much evidence</p>
<p>that meditation is beneficial.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>How do you think it&rsquo;s working</p>
<p>or what do you think it&rsquo;s doing?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think that one of the most important things</p>
<p>that gets worked when we are doing a simple 10 minute</p>
<p>or 12 minute body scan meditation regularly,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s 10 minutes a day, 12 minutes a day,</p>
<p>is the habit building and the practice</p>
<p>of focusing on the present moment.</p>
<p>I think that is very hard for us modern humans to do</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m worrying about the thing that&rsquo;s due</p>
<p>at the end of the week that I need to do</p>
<p>and how many hours am I gonna have to be able to do that?</p>
<p>Or I&rsquo;m worried about whatever,</p>
<p>the email that wasn&rsquo;t as polite as it should be that I sent</p>
<p>and what were the repercussions for that?</p>
<p>Instead of focusing on this moment, which is fun.</p>
<p>I get to talk to you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a beautiful day outside.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m feeling good right at this moment.</p>
<p>And I think that those,</p>
<p>all of the meditative practices that I&rsquo;ve done,</p>
<p>and this one also, whether you know it or not,</p>
<p>is getting you to focus on this moment.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s even more important in this day and age</p>
<p>where anxiety levels and the next variant might come out</p>
<p>and what are the repercussions there?</p>
<p>And I have a mother who&rsquo;s older</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s more susceptible to it and there&rsquo;s a war</p>
<p>and what&rsquo;s gonna happen there.</p>
<p>Those are all future possibilities.</p>
<p>And we should be worried about that.</p>
<p>That is a possibility.</p>
<p>You need to plan for that.</p>
<p>But you also need to focus on this moment right now.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m healthy.</p>
<p>I can breathe.</p>
<p>I get to have this interesting conversation</p>
<p>right in this moment.</p>
<p>If I start thinking about other things,</p>
<p>then it takes away from this moment.</p>
<p>Do I know what circuits are involved?</p>
<p>Not exactly.</p>
<p>That is not my area.</p>
<p>I think there are some studies that have focused</p>
<p>on that present moment kind of activity.</p>
<p>But that is what I think is most important</p>
<p>about the practice of meditation</p>
<p>or one of the important things that calms us down.</p>
<p>Because if you know how to do that,</p>
<p>that gives you this powerful tool for the rest of your day.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not locked into that fearful future thinking</p>
<p>that so many of us have</p>
<p>or that just reliving of a terrible past,</p>
<p>but you could enjoy the present moment.</p>
<p>Yeah, that really resonates.</p>
<p>I think that going back</p>
<p>to the earlier part of our conversation,</p>
<p>the hippocampus has this incredible storage capacity</p>
<p>and ability to set context about past, present, and future.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a beautiful thing</p>
<p>because as much as I like to think</p>
<p>he had some semblance of a healthy life,</p>
<p>none of us want to be HM.</p>
<p>None of us want to be in the position</p>
<p>of not being able to form new memories</p>
<p>and have no context to the past or the present.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re grateful that,</p>
<p>we should all be grateful that our hippocampus</p>
<p>can draw from past, present, and future</p>
<p>in various combinations,</p>
<p>and we should support it through the daily exercise</p>
<p>and other habits, let&rsquo;s call them habits</p>
<p>so that people make them habits that you&rsquo;ve highlighted.</p>
<p>But if we are not deliberately anchoring</p>
<p>within past, present, and future according to what we need</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re just shuffling between past, present, and future,</p>
<p>that is not a good way to live.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not effective.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>It sounds like meditation can really help us</p>
<p>go to the right stacks.</p>
<p>I guess people don&rsquo;t go to libraries anymore,</p>
<p>but in the old days you would go,</p>
<p>you need to go to the right location in the library.</p>
<p>You actually can&rsquo;t get distracted</p>
<p>by the books that you&rsquo;re interested in</p>
<p>if you need to go just reflexively,</p>
<p>if you need to go study a particular topic.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s kind of how I think about it.</p>
<p>It makes us more linear perhaps in our way of being.</p>
<p>I think so.</p>
<p>And it actually counteracts,</p>
<p>not that I&rsquo;m against technology,</p>
<p>but having our phones and being connected</p>
<p>to every good and bad thing going on in the world today</p>
<p>is incredibly distracting</p>
<p>and takes you away from the present moment</p>
<p>virtually 24 hours a day.</p>
<p>And so we have to work extra hard right now</p>
<p>compared to in the 40s</p>
<p>when we didn&rsquo;t have all this technology</p>
<p>or at the same level.</p>
<p>So yeah, it becomes even more important practice</p>
<p>I think for everyday life.</p>
<p>Yeah, or even 10, 15 years ago</p>
<p>it felt like smartphones weren&rsquo;t as intrusive.</p>
<p>One final question and maybe a request</p>
<p>as the new incoming Dean</p>
<p>of College of Letters and Sciences.</p>
<p>And I must say I&rsquo;m delighted,</p>
<p>thrilled actually to hear that</p>
<p>a lot of the practices that we&rsquo;ve been discussing today</p>
<p>and that you&rsquo;ve pioneered</p>
<p>are going to be incorporated into undergraduate education.</p>
<p>I predict and I&rsquo;d be willing to wager</p>
<p>that that will become a template</p>
<p>for how universities and non-university systems</p>
<p>should function.</p>
<p>Because if indeed, and it is true</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s this incredible relationship</p>
<p>between physical movement</p>
<p>and mental deliberate practices and performance,</p>
<p>any corporation, school, household would be crazy,</p>
<p>would be self-limiting and even self-destructive</p>
<p>to not incorporate those.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m so happy that you&rsquo;re going to do this</p>
<p>and collect data.</p>
<p>Please, we&rsquo;ll have to touch back with you</p>
<p>and hear what comes to that.</p>
<p>But one of the main things that I hear so much about today</p>
<p>are issues with attention.</p>
<p>And we haven&rsquo;t talked about attention.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve mainly been talking about memory and cognition.</p>
<p>But you know a lot about attention.</p>
<p>And here I&rsquo;m not being disparaging.</p>
<p>I think people have done what I&rsquo;m about to say</p>
<p>as a consequence of need and lack of other resources.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an immense amount of Adderall use,</p>
<p>Ritalin use, modafinil use, and caffeine abuse.</p>
<p>Now I happen to like caffeine.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t use the other compounds I described.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s just incredible to me how the data on this are,</p>
<p>a colleague of mine at Stanford claims</p>
<p>that something like two thirds or more of college students</p>
<p>use these without prescription for ADHD.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What can we expect in terms of the effects</p>
<p>of regular exercise on attention?</p>
<p>And are there any other things</p>
<p>besides exercise and meditation</p>
<p>that you would like to see people do</p>
<p>in terms of trying to increase their powers of attention?</p>
<p>Because I think the ability to focus and attend</p>
<p>is really the distinguishing feature</p>
<p>between those that will succeed in any endeavor</p>
<p>and those that won&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a scary thing for a lot of people to hear</p>
<p>because a lot of people think they have ADHD.</p>
<p>They may or may not.</p>
<p>But I bet that a number of students at both Stanford</p>
<p>and NYU feel challenged with holding their attention</p>
<p>to the thing that they need to hold their attention to.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>So I would say the top three tools</p>
<p>that everybody right this minute today</p>
<p>can use to up their capacity to attend</p>
<p>where they want to include exercise</p>
<p>for the reasons we&rsquo;ve talked about.</p>
<p>It has a direct effect on functioning</p>
<p>of the prefrontal cortex.</p>
<p>Meditation also, clear clinical studies</p>
<p>showing improved ability to focus</p>
<p>and particularly focus on the present moment.</p>
<p>And the third has to be sleep.</p>
<p>So sleep is, you can&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s out of the three, it is the most physiological.</p>
<p>I mean, I could live my whole life</p>
<p>without meditating one minute.</p>
<p>Could I survive without sleep?</p>
<p>No, none of us could.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s more basic physiological,</p>
<p>but it is so important for all core cognitive functions,</p>
<p>including attention, including creativity,</p>
<p>including just good basic brain function.</p>
<p>That is why it&rsquo;s so critical to get that information,</p>
<p>that basic neuroscience information</p>
<p>into the heads of these students</p>
<p>that are trying their best to show us how their brain work,</p>
<p>but being hampered because they&rsquo;re not moving enough,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not meditating.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s all these distracting things</p>
<p>that they include in their lives.</p>
<p>Some of which a little bit is good,</p>
<p>but 24 hours a day on your phone and LinkedIn,</p>
<p>not LinkedIn, but linked to your phone</p>
<p>is damaging to your attention.</p>
<p>So exercise, meditation, sleep can help you learn,</p>
<p>retain and perform better</p>
<p>than if you do not have these three things in your life.</p>
<p>Wonderful, music to my ears.</p>
<p>And also either very low cost or zero cost,</p>
<p>considering that the exercise doesn&rsquo;t require a class.</p>
<p>Use the freely available resource of gravity</p>
<p>to do jumping jacks or burpees or pushups or whatever,</p>
<p>or sit-ups or all of those in combination.</p>
<p>And don&rsquo;t forget YouTube,</p>
<p>the freely accessible millions of YouTube videos.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t want to do your jumping jacks by yourself,</p>
<p>I always say this, I talk about breath meditation</p>
<p>for my book, Good Anxiety.</p>
<p>And if you don&rsquo;t like the one that I suggest,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s only about a million more on YouTube</p>
<p>with ratings from one star to five stars.</p>
<p>So use that resource.</p>
<p>It is a wonderful resource.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re an amazing resource.</p>
<p>Wendy, thank you so much for coming here today</p>
<p>to have this discussion and share your knowledge</p>
<p>about not just existing data,</p>
<p>but new data coming out soon.</p>
<p>And for your leadership in the university system,</p>
<p>for your leadership in public education,</p>
<p>for the decades of important work</p>
<p>on memory and neural circuitry,</p>
<p>which we&rsquo;ve got to learn about today as well.</p>
<p>Thank you ever so much.</p>
<p>Thank you, Andrew.</p>
<p>Fun conversation.</p>
<p>Thank you for joining me today for my discussion</p>

<p>There you will also find titles</p>
<p>and links to her popular books,</p>
<p>as well as her social media handles.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve also placed those in the show note captions.</p>

<p>And on both Spotify and Apple,</p>
<p>you can leave us up to a five-star review.</p>
<p>If you have suggestions about guests or topics</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;d like us to cover on the Huberman Lab podcast,</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;d like to give us feedback of any kind,</p>
<p>please leave that in the comment section on YouTube.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the best place to give us feedback.</p>
<p>Please also check out the sponsors mentioned</p>
<p>at the beginning of today&rsquo;s episode.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the best way to support this podcast.</p>
<p>We also have a Patreon.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s patreon.com slash Andrew Huberman.</p>
<p>And there you can support the podcast</p>
<p>at any level that you like.</p>
<p>On many episodes of the Huberman Lab podcast,</p>
<p>we discuss supplements.</p>
<p>While supplements are certainly not necessary for everybody,</p>
<p>many people derive tremendous benefit from them</p>
<p>for things like accelerating the transition into sleep</p>
<p>and getting better, deeper sleep,</p>
<p>as well as enhancing focus and learning</p>
<p>and other aspects of human performance and health.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re excited to announce</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve partnered with Momentus Supplements.</p>
<p>The reason we partnered with Momentus is several fold.</p>
<p>First of all, we wanted to have one location</p>
<p>where Huberman Lab podcast listeners could go</p>
<p>in order to find all the supplements that we talk about</p>
<p>and to find those in a form</p>
<p>where they could systematically try one or the other.</p>
<p>This is a real issue in the supplement industry.</p>
<p>A lot of supplement brands out there</p>
<p>combine different ingredients in ways</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t really allow you to pinpoint</p>
<p>exactly what you need and what you don&rsquo;t need.</p>
<p>So getting supplements that have low doses</p>
<p>or just the minimal effective dose of particular ingredients</p>
<p>and being able to mix and match those ingredients yourself</p>
<p>and really establish what&rsquo;s best for you is really key.</p>
<p>In addition, we came to realize</p>
<p>that a lot of our listeners want supplements,</p>
<p>but they reside outside of the United States.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re pleased to tell you that Momentus ships</p>
<p>both within the US and internationally.</p>
<p>And of course, Momentus Supplements</p>
<p>are of the very highest quality ingredients</p>
<p>and the precision of the amounts of those ingredients</p>
<p>is tightly regulated.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re interested in Momentus Supplements,</p>
<p>the catalog of supplements</p>
<p>related to the Huberman Lab podcast are growing all the time.</p>
<p>A good number of them are already there.</p>
<p>You can go to livemomentus.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>in order to find them.</p>
<p>And there will be additional supplements</p>
<p>added to that site as we go forward.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re not already following Huberman Lab</p>
<p>on Twitter and Instagram,</p>
<p>I post neuroscience and other science-related information</p>
<p>and tools on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Some of that information overlaps</p>
<p>with the content of the Huberman Lab podcast,</p>
<p>but a lot of it is distinct from the information</p>
<p>contained on the Huberman Lab podcast.</p>
<p>So again, that&rsquo;s Huberman Lab on Instagram</p>
<p>and Huberman Lab on Twitter.</p>
<p>We also have a neural network newsletter.</p>
<p>What that is is a monthly newsletter</p>
<p>in which I distill critical points</p>
<p>from different podcast episodes,</p>
<p>provide links to useful resources.</p>
<p>If you want to sign up for that newsletter,</p>
<p>I should mention it is zero cost</p>
<p>and we do not share your email with anybody.</p>
<p>And we have a very clear privacy policy</p>
<p>posted at HubermanLab.com.</p>
<p>Just go to HubermanLab.com, click on the menu,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll see the neural network newsletter.</p>
<p>You can also look at examples of newsletters</p>
<p>without having to sign up to make sure</p>
<p>that you actually do want to sign up.</p>
<p>But if you are interested, the signup is there, very easy,</p>
<p>and you can receive our monthly newsletter.</p>
<p>So once again, thank you for joining me today</p>
<p>for our voyage into the neuroscience of learning and memory</p>
<p>and tools to get better at learning and memory.</p>
<p>And as always, thank you for your interest in science.</p>
