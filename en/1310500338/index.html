    <p>The following is a conversation with Abbas Amanat,</p>
<p>a historian at Yale University</p>
<p>specializing in the modern history of Iran.</p>
<p>My love and my heart goes out to the Iranian people</p>
<p>in their current struggle for freedom.</p>
<p>I hope that this conversation helps folks who listen</p>
<p>understand the nature and the importance of this struggle.</p>
<p>And now a quick few second mention of each sponsor.</p>
<p>Check them out in the description.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the best way to support this podcast.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got Henson Shaving for a great razor and shave,</p>
<p>Insight Tracker for bio-monitoring,</p>
<p>Onnit for supplements, and ExpressVPN for privacy.</p>
<p>Choose wisely, my friends.</p>
<p>And now onto the full ad reads.</p>
<p>As always, no ads in the middle.</p>
<p>I try to make this interesting, but if you skip them,</p>
<p>please still check out our sponsors.</p>
<p>I enjoy their stuff, maybe you will too.</p>
<p>This show is brought to you by Henson Shaving,</p>
<p>a family-owned aerospace manufacturer</p>
<p>bringing precision engineering to your shaving experience.</p>
<p>This thing is a minimalist razor</p>
<p>that just reminds me of great design</p>
<p>and of great engineering.</p>
<p>They use aerospace grade CNC machines</p>
<p>to achieve extreme precision.</p>
<p>The razors extend just 0.0013 inches,</p>
<p>which is less than the thickness of a human hair.</p>
<p>It makes me feel good to know</p>
<p>that you can mass manufacture a consumer product</p>
<p>with that level of precision.</p>
<p>Obviously, there&rsquo;s precision electronics,</p>
<p>so your smartphone is manufactured at scale</p>
<p>with the tiny, tiny, tiny little electronics inside there</p>
<p>that work incredibly well for months and years.</p>
<p>But to have that in a razor is especially nice</p>
<p>because you don&rsquo;t see it that often.</p>
<p>The thing is the razor works</p>
<p>with standard double-edged blades you can buy anywhere.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all about building the best razor, not razor business.</p>
<p>So no subscriptions, no plastics, and no planned obsolescence.</p>
<p>Check out hensonshaving.com slash lux to pick your razor</p>
<p>and also use code lux,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll get 100 free blades with your razor.</p>
<p>Just make sure to add them to your cart.</p>
<p>This show is also brought to you by Insight Tracker,</p>
<p>a service I use to track biological data</p>
<p>as I lean back in comfort in my chair</p>
<p>and scream from a distance into the microphone.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s obvious to me that the future</p>
<p>is all about using data that comes from your own body</p>
<p>to make lifestyle decisions, diet decisions,</p>
<p>career decisions, all kinds of decisions.</p>
<p>Another term for this is personalization.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;ve heard somebody use the term</p>
<p>like deep personalization.</p>
<p>So personalization based not just</p>
<p>on a few manually set preferences,</p>
<p>but that comes from the entirety of the rich amount</p>
<p>of signal that comes from the human body.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s obvious that this is what the future is about,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s great that companies like Insight Tracker</p>
<p>are doing this kind of thing.</p>
<p>You can use all kinds of data that comes from your body,</p>
<p>blood data, DNA data, fitness tracker data,</p>
<p>to make good decisions about your life.</p>

<p>This episode is also brought to you by Onnit,</p>
<p>a nutrition supplement and fitness company.</p>
<p>They make AlphaBrain, a nootropic</p>
<p>that helps support memory, mental speed, and focus.</p>
<p>I just saw Duncan Strassel pop up</p>
<p>on the Joe Rogan Experience.</p>
<p>I need to listen to that episode.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s probably my favorite guest.</p>
<p>And both of them I associate with Onnit.</p>
<p>Duncan in particular I associate with extreme level</p>
<p>of high mental performance.</p>
<p>No, well actually yes, in a very non-standard definition</p>
<p>of what high levels of performance is.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s just an incredible human being.</p>
<p>Kind, brilliant, with thoughts that are sometimes</p>
<p>filled with humor, non-sequitur humor,</p>
<p>but also deep, profound insights</p>
<p>of the like I haven&rsquo;t heard from anybody else.</p>
<p>He must be using AlphaBrain.</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t know that, but for me,</p>
<p>I use AlphaBrain when I need to really focus.</p>
<p>When I know it&rsquo;s gonna be a deep work session</p>
<p>where I have to solve a particularly challenging problem,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll use AlphaBrain to give me a boost.</p>
<p>Anyway, you can get a special discount on AlphaBrain</p>
<p>at lexfriedman.com slash Onnit.</p>
<p>This show is also brought to you by ExpressVPN.</p>
<p>I use them to protect my privacy on the internet.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m actually having a great conversation</p>
<p>with somebody about Tor coming up,</p>
<p>and Tor is like an extra layer of protecting your privacy</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re browsing the internet,</p>
<p>but for most of us, we should be using</p>
<p>the sort of the low-hanging fruit,</p>
<p>the technology that works for everybody for everything,</p>
<p>not just browsing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a VPN, and my favorite VPN,</p>
<p>and the ones I&rsquo;ve used for many, many, many years</p>
<p>is ExpressVPN.</p>
<p>Big, sexy button, you press, and it just works.</p>
<p>You set the location that you want your computer to emulate,</p>
<p>and bam, and the connection is super fast,</p>
<p>plus it&rsquo;s stable, everything&rsquo;s very intuitive,</p>
<p>works on any operating system,</p>
<p>including my favorite one, which is Linux,</p>
<p>but obviously on mobile devices, too,</p>
<p>iPhone, all the Android devices.</p>
<p>I have so many Android devices now</p>
<p>that I feel like I&rsquo;m like a sheep herder,</p>
<p>and those are my sheep, but instead of being sheep,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re actually supercomputers,</p>
<p>although you can argue that a sheep, too,</p>
<p>is a supercomputer.</p>
<p>Anyway, go to expressvpn.com slash LexPod</p>
<p>for an extra three months free.</p>

<p>in the description, and now, dear friends,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s Abbas Aminat.</p>
<p>‚ô™‚ô™</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with the current situation in Iran.</p>
<p>On September 16th, protests broke out in Tehran</p>
<p>and quickly spread over the death</p>
<p>of a 22-year-old Mahsa Amini.</p>
<p>Eyewitnesses saw her beaten to death</p>
<p>by the morality police.</p>
<p>This is a heavy topic, but it&rsquo;s a really important topic.</p>
<p>Can you explain what happened?</p>
<p>The protests are now in their sixth week.</p>
<p>The death of that young woman, a Kurd,</p>
<p>who was visiting Tehran as a tourist,</p>
<p>sparked something very deep</p>
<p>that particularly concerned the younger generations.</p>
<p>That is what you would call the equivalent</p>
<p>of the Z generation in this country.</p>
<p>They call themselves Dahey-e Hashdadi in Persian</p>
<p>because Iran follows the solar calendar of its own.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an ancient solar calendar.</p>
<p>And the time that they were born,</p>
<p>they were in the 1380s.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what they called themselves, Hashdadi.</p>
<p>Eighties, Hashdad for the eighties.</p>
<p>And, well, the circumstances that surrounds</p>
<p>the unfortunate death of this young,</p>
<p>beautiful Kurdish woman is really tragic.</p>
<p>She was arrested by what is referred to</p>
<p>as the morality police, morality patrol,</p>
<p>called the Gasht-e Ershad, guidance police, that is.</p>
<p>Presumably, there were two women fully clad,</p>
<p>that is, officers serving on that force, and two men.</p>
<p>And nobody exactly knows what had happened.</p>
<p>She had been beaten up,</p>
<p>and apparently there was no sign</p>
<p>of any wrongdoing on her side.</p>
<p>She was fully covered.</p>
<p>It seems that there was some altercation in the process.</p>
<p>And the outcome was that she was unconscious.</p>
<p>Not necessarily when she was arrested,</p>
<p>but in the course of the detention,</p>
<p>when they take them to a center,</p>
<p>presumably to re-educate them.</p>
<p>And she apparently collapsed.</p>
<p>And maybe my sense is that she must have had</p>
<p>some kind of a problem because of the skull being broken</p>
<p>or something had happened.</p>
<p>And she died in the hospital the next day.</p>
<p>And that, through the social media,</p>
<p>was widely spread throughout Iran.</p>
<p>And almost the next day, surprisingly,</p>
<p>you could see this outburst of sympathy for her.</p>
<p>People are in the streets weeping</p>
<p>because she was seen as such an innocent young woman,</p>
<p>22 years old.</p>
<p>And the family, the mother and the father,</p>
<p>also mourning for her.</p>
<p>And being a Kurd visiting Tehran,</p>
<p>this all added up to really turn her</p>
<p>into some kind of a martyr of this cause.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what it is.</p>
<p>Her picture,</p>
<p>graphics that were artistically produced</p>
<p>based on her portrait,</p>
<p>has now dominates basically as the symbol</p>
<p>of this protest movement.</p>
<p>And the protest movement goes on.</p>
<p>Everybody was thinking,</p>
<p>or at least the authorities were thinking,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s going to die out in a matter of a few days.</p>
<p>But it became more intense.</p>
<p>First in the streets of Tehran by young women,</p>
<p>mostly probably between, I would say, 17, 18 teenagers</p>
<p>to 22, 23 or thereabouts.</p>
<p>And then to university campuses all around the country.</p>
<p>And then even to high schools.</p>
<p>And that also made it a very remarkable protest movement</p>
<p>because, first of all, it involves the youth</p>
<p>and not necessarily the older generations.</p>
<p>You see them around, but not as many.</p>
<p>Also, you see men and women together,</p>
<p>young girls and boys.</p>
<p>And they are adamant.</p>
<p>They are desperate in the sense of the tone of their protest.</p>
<p>And they are extremely courageous</p>
<p>because they stand against the security forces</p>
<p>that were immediately were sent off to the streets.</p>
<p>So, and in full gear, that is.</p>
<p>So what are the currents of pain, emotion?</p>
<p>What is this turmoil that rose to the surface</p>
<p>that resulted in these big protests?</p>
<p>What are the different feelings,</p>
<p>ideas that came to the surface here</p>
<p>that resulted in such quick scaling of this protest?</p>
<p>Well, if you listen to the main slogan,</p>
<p>which is the message of this movement,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s called Women, Life, Freedom.</p>
<p>Zan, Zendegi, Azadi,</p>
<p>which is a translation of actually the Kurdish equivalent,</p>
<p>which is close to Persian being in the European language.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s apparently initiated first</p>
<p>in the Syrian Kurdistan,</p>
<p>where they were fighting against the Islamic Daesh forces</p>
<p>because they were attacking the Yazidis there</p>
<p>and the women being enslaved.</p>
<p>But the message, as it moved,</p>
<p>well, historians are interested in this kind of trends.</p>
<p>So it has moved to Kurdistan and from Kurdistan,</p>
<p>now being the message of this movement,</p>
<p>reflects pretty much,</p>
<p>sums up what this movement is all about.</p>
<p>Women in the forefront,</p>
<p>because of all the, one might say,</p>
<p>discriminations, the treatment, the humiliation,</p>
<p>that this younger generation feels,</p>
<p>well, not only the younger generations,</p>
<p>but most of the Iranian secular middle classes</p>
<p>since 1979, basically, for the past 43 years.</p>
<p>And they would think that these all basically symbolized</p>
<p>or represented by the wearing,</p>
<p>the mandatory wearing of the hijab,</p>
<p>which is at the core of this protest.</p>
<p>You see the young women,</p>
<p>if you look at many of these clips</p>
<p>that comes through in the past six weeks,</p>
<p>women in streets take off their mandatory scarves,</p>
<p>which is a young shawl</p>
<p>or some kind of a head covering, that&rsquo;s all.</p>
<p>And they throw it into the bonfire</p>
<p>in the middle of the street</p>
<p>and they dance around it and slogans.</p>
<p>So there is a sense of complete rejection</p>
<p>of what this regime for 43 years</p>
<p>have been imposing on women.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not, as it&rsquo;s sometimes been portrayed,</p>
<p>a movement against hijab through and through,</p>
<p>but it basically says there has to be a choice</p>
<p>for those who want to wear hijab</p>
<p>and those who want to remain without hijab.</p>
<p>Yeah, the hijab is a symbol of something much deeper.</p>
<p>Much deeper.</p>
<p>And actually, before we get into that,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s interesting to note</p>
<p>that in many of these demonstrations</p>
<p>we see in the university campuses or in the streets,</p>
<p>you see women with hijab,</p>
<p>young women with hijab,</p>
<p>or next to those have to remove their hijab</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re together basically protesting.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the most interesting feature of these demonstrations.</p>
<p>And then men and women together</p>
<p>against the segregation that the regime</p>
<p>has imposed upon them all these years.</p>
<p>Now, in terms of what it represents,</p>
<p>as I pointed out,</p>
<p>one is the question of the whole series of,</p>
<p>one might say, civil and legal discriminations against women.</p>
<p>You are considered as a kind of a second-class citizen.</p>
<p>You depend on your men.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a kind of a patriarchy</p>
<p>that has been institutionalized in the Islamic Republic</p>
<p>in a very profound fashion.</p>
<p>And that means that probably</p>
<p>in matters of divorce,</p>
<p>marriage and divorce,</p>
<p>in matters of custody of your children,</p>
<p>in matter of inheritance,</p>
<p>in matter of freedom of movement,</p>
<p>you depend on your husband, your father, your brother,</p>
<p>a male member of your family,</p>
<p>your child even, your son, could be the case.</p>
<p>And because of that, obviously a younger generation</p>
<p>who is so well-informed through social media</p>
<p>knows about the world as much as an American does,</p>
<p>American kid does, probably sometimes more.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re very, very curious.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s from what I hear,</p>
<p>or sometimes that I met a few of them outside Iran.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll see that how this new generation</p>
<p>is completely different from what the Islamic Republic</p>
<p>wanted to create in its social engineering.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s basically the failure of 43 years</p>
<p>of the Islamic Republic&rsquo;s act of imposition</p>
<p>of a certain so-called Islamic values on women.</p>
<p>Then it&rsquo;s a matter of education.</p>
<p>You would see that there is segregation in the schools.</p>
<p>One of the issues that now, right now,</p>
<p>is at the heart of this demonstration</p>
<p>is that self-services in many of the campuses</p>
<p>of Iranian universities are segregated,</p>
<p>male and female to different rooms, to different halls.</p>
<p>Now they&rsquo;re breaking through the walls</p>
<p>virtually everywhere and sit together</p>
<p>in order to basically resist</p>
<p>the authorities who wants to impose segregation.</p>
<p>In matters of appearance in the public,</p>
<p>of course, it may seem to us</p>
<p>as kind of trivial and secondary,</p>
<p>but appearance is important.</p>
<p>Clothing is important.</p>
<p>How you would imagine yourself is important.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t want to be seen in the way</p>
<p>that the authorities would like to impose upon them</p>
<p>as this kind of an idea of a chaste Islamic woman</p>
<p>who is fully covered and is fully protected.</p>
<p>The idea of a male member of the family</p>
<p>protects the female.</p>
<p>That is what you would see at the heart of this rebellion.</p>
<p>And of course, that goes with everything.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the second part of this message,</p>
<p>the idea of life.</p>
<p>Basically means, if you like to use</p>
<p>the American equivalent of this,</p>
<p>the pursuit of the happiness.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what they want.</p>
<p>They want fun.</p>
<p>They want music.</p>
<p>They want dancing.</p>
<p>They want to be free in the street.</p>
<p>They want to have boyfriends and live freely.</p>
<p>And don&rsquo;t be constantly looked by the big brother</p>
<p>to tell them what to do and not to do or not to do.</p>
<p>So that they share virtually with the entire</p>
<p>Iranian society as a whole.</p>
<p>Although the older generations, that&rsquo;s a big puzzle.</p>
<p>But you would see that the older generation don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>so far at least, don&rsquo;t take part as extensively</p>
<p>as one might imagine.</p>
<p>And this is a variety of reasons.</p>
<p>Perhaps we can get to that later on, if you like.</p>
<p>But as far as this younger generation,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t listen even as much to their parents</p>
<p>as the older generations did.</p>
<p>So one might say even the nature of the relationship</p>
<p>between the parents and the youth has changed.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the concept of, again, a patriarchy.</p>
<p>That a father, or even a mother,</p>
<p>would tell the daughter or son what to do.</p>
<p>Basically, they have to negotiate.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fundamentally a rejection of the power of authority.</p>
<p>Parents, government, it&rsquo;s that every person</p>
<p>can decide their own fate.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s no lessening of value of the wisdom</p>
<p>of old age and old institutions.</p>
<p>Precisely, that&rsquo;s what it is.</p>
<p>And they are surprisingly aware</p>
<p>that where they are as a generation.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a sense of pride,</p>
<p>as we are different from the older generation.</p>
<p>From your parents who compromised</p>
<p>and lived with the restrictions</p>
<p>that the Islamic regime put on you.</p>
<p>Your grandparents was the generation</p>
<p>that actually involved in the revolution of 79.</p>
<p>The parents, which were the middle generation.</p>
<p>And these are the third generation</p>
<p>after the revolution of 1979.</p>
<p>And therefore, they differentiate themselves</p>
<p>in terms of their identity from the older generation.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the life part of it.</p>
<p>One can go more and more.</p>
<p>They want to access.</p>
<p>And they see on social media</p>
<p>what happens in the rest of the world.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re well aware.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re much better digitally skilled</p>
<p>than my generation, for instance.</p>
<p>And they know about all the personalities.</p>
<p>They know about all the celebrities.</p>
<p>They know about all the trends that goes on outside Iran.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a second part of this message.</p>
<p>And then, of course, the third part is the word azadi,</p>
<p>meaning freedom or liberty,</p>
<p>which is this long-standing demand of the Iranians,</p>
<p>I would say, for the whole century,</p>
<p>ever since the constitutional revolution of 1906.</p>
<p>Iran has witnessed this problem of authorities</p>
<p>that usually emerged at the end of a revolution</p>
<p>to basically impose its own image</p>
<p>on the population, on the youth,</p>
<p>and create authoritarian regimes,</p>
<p>of which, over the course of time,</p>
<p>I would say that the Islamic Republic is the worst,</p>
<p>in the sense that its intrusion</p>
<p>is not only in the political sense,</p>
<p>in, for instance, banning the freedom of speech,</p>
<p>meddling with the elections,</p>
<p>banning political parties,</p>
<p>all kinds of that things</p>
<p>which are the political or civil freedoms,</p>
<p>but its intrusion into the personal life of the individual,</p>
<p>which is the worst kind, in a sense,</p>
<p>as you would see that there is always an authority</p>
<p>that basically dominates your life</p>
<p>or monitors your life.</p>
<p>So, and they do it in a kind of a very consistent fashion,</p>
<p>which makes this idea of freedom so important</p>
<p>as part of the message of this new movement.</p>
<p>You would see that in today&rsquo;s Iran,</p>
<p>there are no independent political parties.</p>
<p>There is very little, probably, freedom of the press.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t say that it&rsquo;s entirely gone,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s fairly limited.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s enormous amount of propaganda machine</p>
<p>which dominates the entire radio and TV system in Iran.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s completely in the hands of the government.</p>
<p>And, of course, you would see this variety of other tools</p>
<p>for trying to indoctrinate Iranian population</p>
<p>across the board.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s another sign of this kind of a sense</p>
<p>of being totally left out.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not belonging to what&rsquo;s going on</p>
<p>in terms of empowerment and disempowerment.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the situation</p>
<p>as far as the idea of a freedom is concerned.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s three somewhat miraculously</p>
<p>and perhaps unintentionally,</p>
<p>the three parts of this message complement each other.</p>
<p>Because perhaps for the first time,</p>
<p>we see that women are in the forefront of a movement.</p>
<p>I hesitate to say revolution</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m not particularly happy with revolutions.</p>
<p>Revolutions worldwide in Iran have always been so miserable</p>
<p>in terms of their outcome that we have to be careful</p>
<p>not to use the word revolution again.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s where it stands now.</p>
<p>And the regime was thinking that, well, these are kids.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to go away.</p>
<p>And then, of course,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re completely conspiratorial in their thinking.</p>
<p>They constantly think that these are all the instigations</p>
<p>and provocations of foreign powers.</p>
<p>These are the great Satan, the United States.</p>
<p>This is Israel.</p>
<p>Or these are the,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s actually the Supreme Leader says in so many words.</p>
<p>His only response so far that he had in the past six weeks</p>
<p>with regard to this demonstrations is that</p>
<p>these are the children of the Sabaq.</p>
<p>Sabaq being the security forces of the Shah&rsquo;s time.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s 43 years later,</p>
<p>he claims that the children,</p>
<p>16, 17 years, 20 years old,</p>
<p>kids in the street are the grandchildren or children</p>
<p>of some imaginary survival of the Shah&rsquo;s security force.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s the idea is that these protests are internal</p>
<p>and external saboteurs.</p>
<p>So people trying to sabotage the government.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And they are misled.</p>
<p>Misled.</p>
<p>As far as they can go.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s the great Satan, United States</p>
<p>and other places are controlling,</p>
<p>sort of either controlling the narrative,</p>
<p>feeding propaganda or literally sending people</p>
<p>to instigate.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think even they have that kind of imagination</p>
<p>precise to say what you have said.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That they would say that they&rsquo;re controlling the narrative.</p>
<p>They basically say, no, these are agents</p>
<p>of the foreign powers and their families are all sold out</p>
<p>and they are basically lost their loyalties</p>
<p>to the great Islamic Republic.</p>
<p>And therefore they can be treated so brutally.</p>
<p>They can be suppressed so brutally.</p>
<p>Which I haven&rsquo;t actually said what they&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>because I thought perhaps first we should talk</p>
<p>about who these kids are in the streets</p>
<p>before we move on about the response of the government.</p>
<p>But one major factor which seems to add to the anxiety</p>
<p>of, well, the regime is extremely anxious now</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re in a position,</p>
<p>this shows that they don&rsquo;t have the lack of confidence</p>
<p>in a sense that they would see them reacting</p>
<p>in a very forceful way.</p>
<p>Because basically they don&rsquo;t seem to have</p>
<p>that kind of a confidence to allow this message</p>
<p>or the movement to air, to be aired.</p>
<p>But the one element which corresponds to that</p>
<p>is that there is a expatriate population</p>
<p>of Iranians worldwide.</p>
<p>There are probably now according to some estimates</p>
<p>close to four million, even more, Iranians abroad.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re all over the world from Australia</p>
<p>and New Zealand, Japan, Western Europe,</p>
<p>Turkey, and United States and Canada.</p>
<p>So just to give you one example,</p>
<p>last Saturday there was a mass demonstrations in Berlin</p>
<p>by the Iranians from Germany and all over Europe,</p>
<p>Western Europe.</p>
<p>And it was at least, I think probably</p>
<p>the conservative estimate was about 100,000.</p>
<p>So 100,000 Iranians showed up in Berlin</p>
<p>demonstrating against the treatment of the women in Iran</p>
<p>or the movement in Iran.</p>
<p>The government thinks obviously this must have been</p>
<p>some instigation by foreign powers</p>
<p>and they want to destroy the Islamic Republic.</p>
<p>And not only that, but their propaganda</p>
<p>is kind of ridiculous.</p>
<p>Because I listened actually to how they portrayed it</p>
<p>in the newspapers, I listened to the Iranian news</p>
<p>that is officially controlled, government controlled news.</p>
<p>And in the papers, much of the papers</p>
<p>that are in the control of the government.</p>
<p>One of them, or actually the major news program</p>
<p>portrayed the demonstrations that 10,000 people</p>
<p>showed up in Berlin and protested against the rising prices</p>
<p>or rising rates for gas and oil in Germany.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s how they mislead.</p>
<p>In a very rather stupid fashion,</p>
<p>because probably 95%, if not 100% of the Iranians</p>
<p>are listening to Persian-speaking media outside Iran.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a BBC Persian, there is Iran International,</p>
<p>there are at least five or six of them.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s probably really important to highlight</p>
<p>that Iran is a very modern and tech-savvy nation.</p>
<p>Not just the young people.</p>
<p>Probably more than I feel sometimes</p>
<p>when I compare myself to what they are doing.</p>
<p>Since 1979, the earlier years, for a decade or two,</p>
<p>they tried in a very crude fashion</p>
<p>to restrict access to media outside Iran.</p>
<p>Because this is all through dishes, okay?</p>
<p>And satellite dishes are everywhere.</p>
<p>If you look at the buildings, small towns and villages,</p>
<p>in Iran, there&rsquo;s always a dish.</p>
<p>And they watch all kinds of things through this.</p>
<p>And particularly because of what&rsquo;s happening now,</p>
<p>they listen to all the news broadcasts</p>
<p>from all this media, and they&rsquo;re extremely active.</p>
<p>There are probably, some of them, even 24 hours,</p>
<p>or close, very extensive coverage of every clip</p>
<p>that comes through.</p>
<p>So what the government is doing now, the Islamic Republic,</p>
<p>is that they restrict the entire internet.</p>
<p>They shut down the internet.</p>
<p>They shut down the internet,</p>
<p>but they cannot afford shutting down the internet</p>
<p>because much of the business, much of the everyday life,</p>
<p>much of the government affairs depends on the internet,</p>
<p>like everywhere else.</p>
<p>And Iran is extremely, if I hear from many of the colleagues</p>
<p>and friends, it&rsquo;s like, in certain respects,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like Sweden, where you go there,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no more currency, and for a very good reason,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s so much inflation,</p>
<p>that the banknotes are worthless, in a sense.</p>
<p>So everything is through sweeping your card.</p>
<p>And that entire system is in a standstill</p>
<p>because people cannot buy food.</p>
<p>You go to the supermarket, that&rsquo;s how you would do it.</p>
<p>You order food to come to your house,</p>
<p>which Iranians, at least the middle classes,</p>
<p>more prosperous middle classes, doing all the time.</p>
<p>So they deliver everything.</p>
<p>And because of the COVID, it became even more.</p>
<p>And they have to pay all through this system.</p>
<p>So what happens is that now they&rsquo;re estimating</p>
<p>that every day, $50 million, the Iranian government,</p>
<p>or the Iranian economy, is losing</p>
<p>because of slowing the internet.</p>
<p>Plus the frustration is growing</p>
<p>because you can&rsquo;t order food.</p>
<p>Among other things.</p>
<p>I mean, they are in touch with, I mean, WhatsApp,</p>
<p>every Iranian, virtually every Iranian,</p>
<p>that has education, and education in the sense</p>
<p>that has gone through the high schools and universities,</p>
<p>knows how to use the WhatsApp.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a big middle class.</p>
<p>Like you said, secular middle class in Iran.</p>
<p>And there, there&rsquo;s a lot of, at least, capacity for,</p>
<p>if not revolution, then political, ideological turmoil.</p>
<p>And a huge amount of hatred.</p>
<p>So the hatred has grown.</p>
<p>Yes, hatred of the policies of the regime, of isolation.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a huge point that you hear a great deal about.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t want to be isolated.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t want to be humiliated.</p>
<p>Iran is not about this miserable regime</p>
<p>that is ruling over us.</p>
<p>That is ruling over us.</p>
<p>We have a great culture.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a sense of pride in their own culture.</p>
<p>Some of it, you know, Islamic, some of it pre-Islamic.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a huge sense of pride in that.</p>
<p>And they see that they cannot communicate</p>
<p>with the outside world.</p>
<p>They want to travel abroad, which they do.</p>
<p>I mean, for one thing, the Iranian regime never actually,</p>
<p>for majority of the population, never puts restrictions.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like, what is it, Soviet Union,</p>
<p>where you have to have a, you used to have a permission</p>
<p>to move from one place to another.</p>
<p>And then, of course, the Islamic regime, since 1979,</p>
<p>basically chased away or destroyed the old middle class.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my generation, basically, or my parents&rsquo; generation.</p>
<p>These are the secular middle class of the Pahlavi era,</p>
<p>in the hope that they can do this social engineering</p>
<p>and create this Islamic society of their own.</p>
<p>The bad news for them was that that didn&rsquo;t happen,</p>
<p>and that memory persisted, and the middle class</p>
<p>that was created since past 40 years</p>
<p>is much larger in size than what it was,</p>
<p>because there was, of course, the demographic revolution.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the very foundation of it,</p>
<p>is the demographic revolution.</p>
<p>Population in Iran, I&rsquo;ve written an article</p>
<p>about it, actually.</p>
<p>Population in Iran, since the turn of the century,</p>
<p>last century, the 20th century,</p>
<p>population of Iran was about nine million or so.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s now 83 million.</p>
<p>And that is, since 1979, the population was 35 million.</p>
<p>Between the past 40 years, it&rsquo;s basically doubled.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s 83 million.</p>
<p>Although, one of the great successes,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to bore you with the details</p>
<p>about the demography, but it&rsquo;s important.</p>
<p>Please, demographics is not boring.</p>
<p>You can see that the birth rate was very high.</p>
<p>Otherwise, you wouldn&rsquo;t have doubled your population</p>
<p>in a matter of four decades.</p>
<p>But Iranians, because of the urban shift</p>
<p>to an urban population, because of the growth</p>
<p>of the middle class, because of the education,</p>
<p>they basically, the pattern of the middle class</p>
<p>growth, population growth, changed.</p>
<p>Iran used to be 2.8 or 3% birth rate</p>
<p>in around 1980s, I would say, 1970s, 1980s.</p>
<p>Now, it is 1.1.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s probably the most successful country</p>
<p>in the Middle East, in terms of the population control.</p>
<p>Despite the government, a consistent attempt</p>
<p>to try to encourage people to have more kids,</p>
<p>middle class refuses to do that.</p>
<p>And this is middle class, not only anymore in the capital,</p>
<p>but this is very smaller towns and cities,</p>
<p>places that used to be villages.</p>
<p>Now you look at them, they have a decent population,</p>
<p>50,000, 100,000, and they live an urban life.</p>
<p>And they don&rsquo;t want to be subjected to that old pattern</p>
<p>of agrarian society when you had 10 children</p>
<p>or eight children.</p>
<p>And of course, it&rsquo;s much more advanced</p>
<p>in terms of health and medicine.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t lose children as they used to.</p>
<p>The antibiotics, there&rsquo;s always kids to survive.</p>
<p>And therefore, if you have 10 kids,</p>
<p>you stick with 10 kids.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t end up with four as it used to be in the past.</p>
<p>Six of them would have died up to the age of five, actually.</p>
<p>But now, because of that, you see that this urban population</p>
<p>in the cities have completely different demands.</p>
<p>And of course, the education is important.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s another area of how the social engineering</p>
<p>of the Islamic Republic went away.</p>
<p>Because they were thinking that the growth</p>
<p>of the population, the growth of the educated,</p>
<p>higher educated middle classes in their benefit.</p>
<p>Or they could not even control it, in a sense.</p>
<p>Now, Iran in my time probably had,</p>
<p>in the 1970s, probably by the time of the revolution,</p>
<p>had 10, 12 universities.</p>
<p>Now it has 56 universities all across the country.</p>
<p>And there is something referred to</p>
<p>as the free university, Azad,</p>
<p>which has campuses all over the country.</p>
<p>It has 321 campuses all around Iran.</p>
<p>What does that mean?</p>
<p>In many respects, this youth that are brought up</p>
<p>in these families, even in small towns</p>
<p>in very traditional families, in families that belong</p>
<p>to that kind of a more religious, loyal to the clergy</p>
<p>or to the clerical classes,</p>
<p>their children can now move on, particularly women.</p>
<p>Because in my times, it would have been unheard of</p>
<p>that you would have a young woman of 18 or 17, 18, 19</p>
<p>from a traditional city such as, for instance, Yazd</p>
<p>or in Southeastern Iran,</p>
<p>to move on elsewhere for education,</p>
<p>as you do in this country, okay?</p>
<p>Now, it&rsquo;s completely accepted that a woman wears hijab</p>
<p>because she&rsquo;s forced to wear hijab</p>
<p>to go to a university completely</p>
<p>on the other side of the country.</p>
<p>And this movement of the population,</p>
<p>not only because of the universities,</p>
<p>but in general, if you now visit Iran,</p>
<p>you hear accents, local accents, provincial accents</p>
<p>all over the country.</p>
<p>That is a Azerbaijani-Turkish accent</p>
<p>from the northwest of the country.</p>
<p>You can hear it in the first province in the south</p>
<p>and vice versa.</p>
<p>So, and Kurdish, for instance,</p>
<p>or even more marginal regions such as Sistan province</p>
<p>in the southeast of Iran,</p>
<p>which has been the subject of this recent massacre</p>
<p>when they actually attacked the population</p>
<p>when demonstrating and killed a fair number</p>
<p>of at least 60 people.</p>
<p>So, this movement of the population,</p>
<p>this creation of a larger middle class,</p>
<p>the better educated middle class, much better educated.</p>
<p>Iran has 86% literacy,</p>
<p>which I think probably, I haven&rsquo;t checked that,</p>
<p>but probably is better than Turkey even,</p>
<p>is probably better than anywhere else in the Middle East.</p>
<p>And it sounds like that&rsquo;s quickly increasing.</p>
<p>So, because of the movement,</p>
<p>because of the growth of the education system,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>Precisely.</p>
<p>Iran has one million school teachers,</p>
<p>which may not seem as much if you&rsquo;re in the United States,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a fairly big number, actually.</p>
<p>Can you linger on the massacre?</p>
<p>What happened there?</p>
<p>Well, the Sistan province is a Baluch ethnicity,</p>
<p>of Baluch ethnicity.</p>
<p>Baluch is a particular ethnic group in southern Iran,</p>
<p>which is Sunni rather than Shi&rsquo;i, majority.</p>
<p>And we should say that most of Iran is Shi&rsquo;i,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s a branch of Islam.</p>
<p>Shi&rsquo;ism, yes.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s maybe just briefly linger Shi&rsquo;ism and Sunni.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s not get into it.</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t want to.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s do a one-sentence summary,</p>
<p>and that maybe, which is what most of Iran is.</p>
<p>Majority of the population of the Muslim world are Sunnis.</p>
<p>These are mainstream, if you like to call it.</p>
<p>Actually, Sunna means that kind of a mainstream.</p>
<p>Can you actually linger on the Sunni, Sunna, Shi&rsquo;a?</p>
<p>Shi&rsquo;a means a party,</p>
<p>means those that belongs to a party of Ali,</p>
<p>which goes back to the early Islamic history</p>
<p>of seventh century.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m almost lingering to the silly notion</p>
<p>of pronunciation and stuff like that.</p>
<p>So, ah, ah means part,</p>
<p>like what does the extra I at the end do?</p>
<p>Shi&rsquo;i means belonging to the Shi&rsquo;i community.</p>
<p>Shi&rsquo;a means a person of a Shi&rsquo;a.</p>
<p>That belongs to that community.</p>
<p>If you say, are you a Shi&rsquo;a?</p>
<p>Yes, I am a Shi&rsquo;a.</p>
<p>Yeah, and Shi&rsquo;i is the community.</p>
<p>Community, and in English, when it was Anglicized,</p>
<p>it becomes Shi&rsquo;ite.</p>
<p>So, if you say Shi&rsquo;ite in today, it&rsquo;s perfectly acceptable.</p>
<p>And of course, I myself, in my writings,</p>
<p>I always switch between one and the other.</p>
<p>One of my books is always Shi&rsquo;ite,</p>
<p>the other book&rsquo;s always Shi&rsquo;i.</p>
<p>That hasn&rsquo;t been settled.</p>
<p>But the Shi&rsquo;i population is smaller</p>
<p>compared to the Sunni population in the world.</p>
<p>In the world.</p>
<p>In the world.</p>
<p>But in Iran, it&rsquo;s the opposite.</p>
<p>The Iran and Iraq, and possibly now Lebanon,</p>
<p>are the three countries who barely,</p>
<p>Iraq and Lebanon have barely majority Shi&rsquo;i population.</p>
<p>Whereas Iran is a large Shi&rsquo;i population</p>
<p>due to its history of conversion to Shi&rsquo;ism,</p>
<p>that by itself is another story.</p>
<p>But in the sense that,</p>
<p>the way that historically it evolved,</p>
<p>the center became more Shi&rsquo;i,</p>
<p>and the peripheries remained Sunni.</p>
<p>So, you have communities of the Baluch in the southeast.</p>
<p>You have the Kurds.</p>
<p>A large portion of the Kurds are Sunnis.</p>
<p>They have Shi&rsquo;is as well.</p>
<p>Then they have the indigenous religion</p>
<p>of their own, what&rsquo;s called Ahlul Haqq,</p>
<p>which is the religion of indigenous to Kurdistan.</p>
<p>There are Turkmens in the northeast of Iran</p>
<p>who are also Sunnis.</p>
<p>There are other communities in Khorasan region,</p>
<p>in the peripheries of Afghanistan.</p>
<p>They are also Sunnis.</p>
<p>And you have some Arab population,</p>
<p>Arab-speaking population in the Khuzestan province</p>
<p>in the southwest of Iran,</p>
<p>which is also, or across the Persian Gulf.</p>
<p>Is there a lot of conflict between these regions?</p>
<p>And also, like if I blindfolded you</p>
<p>and dropped you off in one of the regions,</p>
<p>would you quickly recognize the region?</p>
<p>Like by the food, by the music,</p>
<p>by the accents, by so on?</p>
<p>Yeah, the answer to your lovely question,</p>
<p>which I think, I hope it would have happened to me,</p>
<p>is that yes, you would see different cultures.</p>
<p>But different food, most important, different accents.</p>
<p>Or different languages, since they have dialects.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s Baluch, different language altogether.</p>
<p>But, or so for that matter, Kurdish,</p>
<p>which is closer to Persian</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re all Indo-European languages.</p>
<p>But Turkish, Azeri Turkish,</p>
<p>which is probably closer to the Turkish of Turkey,</p>
<p>Republic of Turkey,</p>
<p>or to the Republic of Azerbaijan in the north.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re the same, basically.</p>
<p>Actually, if you would have looked,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a fascinating picture.</p>
<p>If you have looked at the, let&rsquo;s say,</p>
<p>even 19th century, early 20th century,</p>
<p>linguistic map of Iran,</p>
<p>you would have been amazed in the number of dialects,</p>
<p>in the number of languages that have survived.</p>
<p>This is an ancient country, it&rsquo;s an ancient land.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a lot of mountains all around it, or big deserts.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a sense of isolation.</p>
<p>So you would say, here and there,</p>
<p>you see a different community that speaks differently.</p>
<p>All ancient traditions and languages.</p>
<p>Yeah, and because of the great number of invasions</p>
<p>that Iran witnessed over more than two and a half millennia,</p>
<p>of course, there are all kinds of cultures</p>
<p>were introduced into Iran.</p>
<p>There are all ethnicities were introduced to Iran,</p>
<p>mostly coming from the northeast of Iran,</p>
<p>from the lowlands of Central Asia and beyond,</p>
<p>and continued into Iran proper.</p>
<p>So, but now, what has happened?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my point that I wanted to make.</p>
<p>Century of modernity, or modernization,</p>
<p>has produced a national culture</p>
<p>of great strength, in a sense, I would say.</p>
<p>I ended my book, the book on Iran,</p>
<p>Iran in Modern History,</p>
<p>basically saying that despite everything else</p>
<p>that has created so much trouble for today&rsquo;s Iran,</p>
<p>there is a sense of a cultural identity</p>
<p>that is very strong.</p>
<p>And I think I can say with some confidence</p>
<p>that despite this regional identities</p>
<p>that are still there and they&rsquo;re great</p>
<p>and they should be celebrated,</p>
<p>today, if you go to Kurdistan,</p>
<p>or if you go to Sistan, they all can speak Persian.</p>
<p>They all have an education in Persian.</p>
<p>So they all basically are becoming part</p>
<p>of whether they like the regime in power or not.</p>
<p>They have a sense of belonging to a culture</p>
<p>and an identity with the center.</p>
<p>And of course, the idea of a center versus periphery</p>
<p>in Iran is very old.</p>
<p>It goes back to ancient times</p>
<p>because even the name of the country</p>
<p>was the guarded domains of Iran.</p>
<p>This is the official name,</p>
<p>Ma&rsquo;malik-e Mahrumseh-e Iran.</p>
<p>Namely, that it was recognized</p>
<p>that this is not just one entity,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a collection of entities.</p>
<p>Like the United States of America.</p>
<p>Exactly, exactly.</p>
<p>But the United States of America,</p>
<p>in a sense, you can say that it was a very successful,</p>
<p>well, it remains to be seen how successful.</p>
<p>To be continued.</p>
<p>To be, that was basically invented, created,</p>
<p>that you would have this sense of it.</p>
<p>In the case of an old nation,</p>
<p>which has been on the map of the world</p>
<p>for 3,000 years, 2,500 years,</p>
<p>this is not an exaggeration.</p>
<p>I am not a nationalist, per se,</p>
<p>but I mean, if you look Persia on the map</p>
<p>of the world in ancient times,</p>
<p>it is still there as it is today.</p>
<p>Very few countries in the world are like that.</p>
<p>That they would have that kind of a continuity</p>
<p>over a course of time.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not without a reason,</p>
<p>because there was this sense of a center versus periphery</p>
<p>that had found, there&rsquo;s a huge amount of tension,</p>
<p>but there is also a sense of belonging to something.</p>
<p>And state is very much at the center of it.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s why the concept of a state matters</p>
<p>for the creation, for the shaping of this culture.</p>
<p>What happened is, therefore,</p>
<p>you can see that today in answer to your point</p>
<p>about traveling blindfolded,</p>
<p>is that you would be surprised to see</p>
<p>how much people share</p>
<p>in terms of, I just give you one anecdote.</p>
<p>In 1968, I believe, must have been,</p>
<p>I traveled to Azerbaijan.</p>
<p>I used to travel and actually photograph.</p>
<p>Not blindfolded, mostly.</p>
<p>Well, yeah, not blindfolded, no, no, not blindfolded.</p>
<p>So I went to a bazaar in the city of Khoi,</p>
<p>which is in the northwestern Iran,</p>
<p>on the border with what is today the Republic of Turkey.</p>
<p>And I went to the bazaar,</p>
<p>and I was interested in the kind of leather work</p>
<p>that they produce.</p>
<p>So I tried to buy some stuff,</p>
<p>and I was surprised to see how few people knew Persian.</p>
<p>So they could not communicate in Persian with you.</p>
<p>Either they have to ask somebody from some other store</p>
<p>to come and translate for you.</p>
<p>This is 1968.</p>
<p>1968, so even though it&rsquo;s the official language.</p>
<p>Was Persian.</p>
<p>Of the country, there&rsquo;s still.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So what are they teaching in school?</p>
<p>So it doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>It was Persian.</p>
<p>But this guy.</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t go to school.</p>
<p>He hasn&rsquo;t been to the school,</p>
<p>or he was not fully exposed to it.</p>
<p>And bazaars usually are very conservative places.</p>
<p>So it stuck in my mind.</p>
<p>Now, recently in 2004, I was traveling to the same area,</p>
<p>not to the same city, but to the same area.</p>
<p>And I was amazed to see how the youth,</p>
<p>as soon as they would know that you&rsquo;re coming</p>
<p>from somewhere else,</p>
<p>opening conversation with you,</p>
<p>talking about the latest movies</p>
<p>that was produced in the West.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not only Hollywood.</p>
<p>Of course, there&rsquo;s a huge amount of fascination</p>
<p>with Hollywood and Western cinema.</p>
<p>Cinema is a major thing.</p>
<p>Filmmaking is a major thing.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So these kids in the city of Ahar</p>
<p>were asking me, we were having lunch.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re asking me, okay,</p>
<p>what do you think about this producer,</p>
<p>not producer, this director, or that actor?</p>
<p>American.</p>
<p>American, European as well,</p>
<p>but mostly American.</p>
<p>Were they speaking Persian?</p>
<p>It was a complete Persian</p>
<p>that I would converse with them</p>
<p>Do they speak English, too?</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>Yes, actually, you would be surprised</p>
<p>to see what percentage of the Iranian youth,</p>
<p>at least in big cities,</p>
<p>are fascinated with learning language.</p>
<p>And for a reason,</p>
<p>because they think that&rsquo;s the way to get access</p>
<p>either on social media or eventually leave Iran,</p>
<p>unfortunately.</p>
<p>And because they don&rsquo;t see a future</p>
<p>for themselves in the country,</p>
<p>either you have to be part of this regime,</p>
<p>or if you hate them</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t like the way of their life,</p>
<p>you look up outside.</p>
<p>I was having drivers to drive me around the country</p>
<p>in the cities around Tehran.</p>
<p>And the guy was young, extremely well-educated,</p>
<p>well-dressed, and we would have looked at him,</p>
<p>we could have found him in any street,</p>
<p>in any country in the Western world.</p>
<p>And his major concern,</p>
<p>knowing that I&rsquo;m from outside,</p>
<p>major concern is,</p>
<p>tell me which would be a better place for me to go.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s wrong with the place that you&rsquo;re in right now?</p>
<p>You are in your own country,</p>
<p>you speak your own language,</p>
<p>no, this is no good.</p>
<p>I have to have a better future.</p>
<p>This has no future for me.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s really interesting</p>
<p>because the thing I feel about the protests right now</p>
<p>is there&rsquo;s a large number of people</p>
<p>that instead of giving in to cynicism</p>
<p>about this government is no good,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re actually getting this energy,</p>
<p>this desire for revolution</p>
<p>in a sort of non-violent,</p>
<p>in the democratic sense of that.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s actually find the ideas,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s build a great nation here.</p>
<p>This is a great nation, this is my nation,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s build something great here.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s my hope.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the outside.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m hoping for.</p>
<p>I share your aspiration,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m fearing that,</p>
<p>I hope it&rsquo;s not a wishful thinking.</p>
<p>Certainly that&rsquo;s what they want.</p>
<p>Certainly that&rsquo;s what they want to create.</p>
<p>But a historian always tells you</p>
<p>from where they start to where they finish,</p>
<p>there is going to be a huge kind of a change.</p>
<p>And in this particular case,</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t be,</p>
<p>I would very much hope that it&rsquo;s not going to be</p>
<p>a revolution like 1979, Islamic revolution.</p>
<p>And I have my hopes in that.</p>
<p>For one thing,</p>
<p>this is a revolution that doesn&rsquo;t have a leader, okay?</p>
<p>And it seems that they&rsquo;re comfortable with that.</p>
<p>At least so far,</p>
<p>because we are in the sixth week of this movement</p>
<p>and they hope it&rsquo;s not going to be actually a revolution</p>
<p>as I pointed out before.</p>
<p>I hope it&rsquo;s going to be more of a sense of trying to come</p>
<p>to some compromise and gradually move toward change</p>
<p>rather than a collapse of this regime</p>
<p>and replacement with what?</p>
<p>So the anxiety of the regime,</p>
<p>you hope will turn into a kind of a realization</p>
<p>that you have to modernize.</p>
<p>You have to make progress.</p>
<p>You actually have to make certain compromises.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Or constitutional changes,</p>
<p>all those kind of stuff.</p>
<p>So the basic process of government and lawmaking.</p>
<p>The problem is that they say we have it all, you know?</p>
<p>We have our parliament,</p>
<p>we have our constitution,</p>
<p>we have our elections,</p>
<p>which has all been, of course, fake.</p>
<p>But they claim they have all of that.</p>
<p>But the problem for them is that they try to superimpose</p>
<p>a certain ideology, like all other ideological autocracies</p>
<p>or autarchies, as in this case,</p>
<p>that tend to dominate all these institution buildings</p>
<p>that they have and they constantly claim</p>
<p>we have this, we have that.</p>
<p>And of course, it&rsquo;s a generational thing.</p>
<p>The upper echelons of this regime</p>
<p>are mostly older people, turbaned, they are the clergy,</p>
<p>that are afraid of the fact that they may lose their control</p>
<p>over their whole system,</p>
<p>that it was a sophisticated, huge system of government.</p>
<p>And they rely on certain tools of control,</p>
<p>which is the Revolutionary Guards</p>
<p>and other institutions that are loyal to the state.</p>
<p>And they spend enormous amount of funds</p>
<p>that is available to them, at least before the sanctions.</p>
<p>But even during the sanctions,</p>
<p>they still have enough funds to do so.</p>
<p>And in order to remain in power.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re extremely ruthless in that regard.</p>
<p>This is not a nice, Islamic, fatherly regime.</p>
<p>This is a regime that I would see easily in it,</p>
<p>clear signs of fascism, clear signs of the state</p>
<p>control and pay any price to stay in power.</p>
<p>So even violence?</p>
<p>Extreme violence.</p>
<p>To return to the massacre,</p>
<p>what were the uses of violence to suppress protests?</p>
<p>Well, yes, it was actually quite remarkable</p>
<p>to see that from the first or the second day of the protest,</p>
<p>you see out in the streets this riot police, okay?</p>
<p>Which comes out in large numbers,</p>
<p>fully geared up, their appearance are rather terrifying,</p>
<p>like any other riot police,</p>
<p>probably more than any other riot police.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re violent, and they stand in the streets</p>
<p>when the students are demonstrating,</p>
<p>even in smaller number.</p>
<p>Because before I go to that,</p>
<p>I should point this out to you as well,</p>
<p>that these demonstrations are not large ones in one place.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t see 100,000 people in one place.</p>
<p>But you see in every neighborhood,</p>
<p>couple of thousand of kids are demonstrating.</p>
<p>All over Iran?</p>
<p>All over Iran.</p>
<p>Now all over the world in different parts?</p>
<p>Yes, yes, yes.</p>
<p>Actually, during the demonstrations three weeks ago,</p>
<p>as I said, they had people in Sydney, Australia,</p>
<p>New Zealand, Tokyo, all over the world.</p>
<p>All protesting high gas prices.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny.</p>
<p>Everywhere.</p>
<p>Everywhere.</p>
<p>To the extent that they could be ignored,</p>
<p>nothing but if they could not be ignored.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s actually quite remarkable</p>
<p>that this is very embarrassing to them.</p>
<p>But somehow they think that this propaganda machine</p>
<p>of them is working.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll say you think they don&rsquo;t have a good even sense.</p>
<p>I mean, so there&rsquo;s an incompetence</p>
<p>within the propaganda machine.</p>
<p>Yes, it is.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an incompetence across the board.</p>
<p>I mean, despite all of this massive government</p>
<p>administration or whatever you would call it,</p>
<p>all these various components of it,</p>
<p>there is a sense of inefficiency and incompetence</p>
<p>that is associated with every action that you see.</p>
<p>Even in their suppression of this street movement.</p>
<p>But in answer to that question,</p>
<p>you would see that they&rsquo;re,</p>
<p>this riot police,</p>
<p>very, it&rsquo;s quite obvious</p>
<p>that they were trained for the purpose.</p>
<p>So this, their appearance, everything.</p>
<p>These are not just regular army forces</p>
<p>or soldiers, conscripts.</p>
<p>They are professional forces.</p>
<p>And they come not only on foot number,</p>
<p>but they come on motorbikes.</p>
<p>So there are, you would see in any of these demonstrations,</p>
<p>there are 10, 12, 15, 20 motorbikes</p>
<p>with two passengers.</p>
<p>One in front riding, one in the back,</p>
<p>fully equipped with a baton, with paint guns,</p>
<p>with pellet guns, and with bullets.</p>
<p>So they are very fully equipped.</p>
<p>And they are terrifying.</p>
<p>They go through the demonstrations</p>
<p>and hit and beat people.</p>
<p>And then they arrest.</p>
<p>And then you see behind the first line</p>
<p>of these riot police,</p>
<p>you would see all these latest models</p>
<p>of these special armored trucks</p>
<p>for moving to the demonstrations</p>
<p>and arresting people, throwing them into this.</p>
<p>And then behind that, water cannons, you see.</p>
<p>And I was looking at that, I was saying,</p>
<p>okay, this is Tehran probably.</p>
<p>They have this.</p>
<p>But then you look at the smaller cities,</p>
<p>they still have the same thing.</p>
<p>So all over the country,</p>
<p>one thing that they had managed to produce extensively,</p>
<p>irrespective of the fact that whether</p>
<p>they are effective or not, but you see them everywhere.</p>
<p>So this shows that how afraid this regime is.</p>
<p>But that also shows that there&rsquo;s an infrastructure</p>
<p>that can implement violence at scale.</p>
<p>Yes, very much so.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s probably part and parcel of this regime</p>
<p>from day one, the number of prisons that they have,</p>
<p>according to perhaps an exaggerated version,</p>
<p>they said that about 12,000 or so arrested</p>
<p>that are in jails today, since past six weeks.</p>
<p>They were 230 or 40 people were killed, including children.</p>
<p>I, under 18, they are,</p>
<p>they beat up women in the street,</p>
<p>which is extremely, actually, disturbing</p>
<p>when you see these scenes of.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a lot of this is on video, too, right?</p>
<p>Everything is on video.</p>
<p>Everybody has a camera.</p>
<p>And everybody sends to major news outlets outside Iran.</p>
<p>And they immediately showed every night,</p>
<p>if you look at BBC Persian or Iran International,</p>
<p>or if you are, I think it is six of them, actually.</p>
<p>All over, they&rsquo;re in England,</p>
<p>they are in Deutsche Welle in Germany,</p>
<p>which has a particular interest in the Iranian,</p>
<p>BBC World Service and so forth in London,</p>
<p>and Voice of America Persian here in this country.</p>
<p>There is another one, Radio Fado,</p>
<p>which is also funded by the American government.</p>
<p>Also fully covers all of these events.</p>
<p>So there is no way that these people can,</p>
<p>that Iran can miss what&rsquo;s going on in the streets</p>
<p>of these demonstrations and the scenes of beating up women,</p>
<p>which in Iranian culture,</p>
<p>as I presume in most cultures in the world,</p>
<p>there is a certain sanctity that you don&rsquo;t attack women.</p>
<p>But they do, and this is an Islamic regime</p>
<p>that supposedly have to have a certain sense of concern</p>
<p>and protection.</p>
<p>Well, like a protection, like a deep respect for women</p>
<p>grounded in a tradition of protecting them,</p>
<p>but instead this kind of idea that was instilled in law</p>
<p>has turned into a deep disrespect of women.</p>
<p>Exactly, or fear that these women are not</p>
<p>any longer the girls that we thought we are bringing up</p>
<p>in this society.</p>
<p>The source of you losing your power will be these women.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the fear.</p>
<p>Yeah, and you see, of course,</p>
<p>this government do have a support base.</p>
<p>I mean, it would be totally wrong to think</p>
<p>that the Islamic Republic has not created</p>
<p>its own power base.</p>
<p>It does.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s probably, if there&rsquo;s no way,</p>
<p>there are no statistics that we can,</p>
<p>or I&rsquo;m not aware of any statistics</p>
<p>that I can give you in numbers,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the percentage of support for the regime in Iran?</p>
<p>But quite frankly, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s more than</p>
<p>probably 10% of the population.</p>
<p>Be very generous.</p>
<p>I would be surprised if it&rsquo;s that low.</p>
<p>I would say, so if my understanding,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ve been very deeply paying attention</p>
<p>to the war in Ukraine, to Ukraine, to Russia,</p>
<p>and to support in Russia for Putin,</p>
<p>I think, without knowing the details,</p>
<p>without even considering the effects of propaganda</p>
<p>and stuff like that, is there&rsquo;s probably a large number</p>
<p>of people in Iran that don&rsquo;t see this</p>
<p>as a battle of human rights,</p>
<p>but see it as a battle of conservatism,</p>
<p>tradition versus modernization, and they value tradition.</p>
<p>That what they fear from the throwing away of the hijab</p>
<p>is not the loss of power and the women getting human rights.</p>
<p>What they fear is the same stuff you fear</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re sitting on a porch and saying,</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Kids these days have no respect.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Basically, there&rsquo;s a large number of Iranians</p>
<p>that probably value tradition</p>
<p>and the beauty of the culture.</p>
<p>And they fear that kids with their internet</p>
<p>and their videos and their revolution</p>
<p>will throw away everything that made this country</p>
<p>hold together for millennia, right?</p>
<p>Yes, I know.</p>
<p>I agree with you in the sense that probably</p>
<p>like everywhere else in the world,</p>
<p>this is a generational thing.</p>
<p>Every generation thinks differently</p>
<p>about the younger generation, no doubt.</p>
<p>And in Iran, it&rsquo;s the same.</p>
<p>But there is another factor here is involved.</p>
<p>Those that we would consider them as traditional</p>
<p>no longer seem to have their loyalties to this regime.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s powerful.</p>
<p>Meaning that they consider it as a brutal regime</p>
<p>that is prepared to kill children in the streets</p>
<p>and does a lot of things wrong.</p>
<p>Of course, it tries to take care of its own power base.</p>
<p>It is a very strong sense of, if we start here,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a very strong sense in this regime</p>
<p>that there are people that is theirs</p>
<p>and there are others which are not theirs.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a word for it, if you&rsquo;re very impressed.</p>
<p>They call it khodi, one of us, okay?</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s very fascistic, it&rsquo;s like.</p>
<p>Yes, yes, or for that matter, I suppose Soviet Union,</p>
<p>if you were a member of the party,</p>
<p>and your children would have received</p>
<p>a special kind of treatment yourself as well.</p>
<p>This sense of us versus them,</p>
<p>for a while worked because the younger people</p>
<p>coming from the countryside to the cities,</p>
<p>certain sector of them would have found protection</p>
<p>and support from the government.</p>
<p>They wanted to belong to something,</p>
<p>and the mosques and the morning associations</p>
<p>in the neighborhoods and so forth would have given them.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s actually a term for it, it&rsquo;s called basiji.</p>
<p>Those have been recruited by the state,</p>
<p>and this is the youth kind of vigilante, if you like,</p>
<p>that you can see them also in these demonstrations.</p>
<p>Sometimes thugs, they&rsquo;re called the civil cloth,</p>
<p>so the people that comes to these demonstrations</p>
<p>that start beating up these young people,</p>
<p>and they are not in security police uniforms,</p>
<p>but they are just regular clothes.</p>
<p>And these people, yes, they still support,</p>
<p>and they still benefit, because they get jobs,</p>
<p>they get privileges, and these are very important</p>
<p>for a state that basically monopolizes</p>
<p>most of the resources.</p>
<p>You see, even during the sanction,</p>
<p>let alone before the sanction,</p>
<p>the oil revenue of Iran, which is the major source</p>
<p>of the state government, was the monopoly of the state.</p>
<p>It was monopoly of the state during the Pahlavi era,</p>
<p>from the start, basically.</p>
<p>So what does that mean?</p>
<p>That means that the regime in power is not,</p>
<p>no longer is particularly accountable</p>
<p>to the majority population,</p>
<p>because it extracts wealth from underground,</p>
<p>and it uses it for its own purposes,</p>
<p>in order to make it more powerful,</p>
<p>in order to make it more repressive</p>
<p>than what it is, the regime today.</p>
<p>So it feeds a small, or I wouldn&rsquo;t say,</p>
<p>but a fair number of its own supporters.</p>
<p>I mean, the revolutionary guard in Iran</p>
<p>is probably about 350,000, or something like that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very big force.</p>
<p>And this is not the regular army.</p>
<p>The revolutionary guards are independent from the army.</p>
<p>Revolutionary guard is armed forces</p>
<p>controlled by the state.</p>
<p>Yes, the same as the army,</p>
<p>but these are more ideologically tied up with the state.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re also in-facing, internal-facing?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s their stated, what&rsquo;s the stated purpose</p>
<p>of the revolutionary guard?</p>
<p>From day one, when the revolution succeeded,</p>
<p>the regime in power, the Islamic regime in power,</p>
<p>was vulnerable to all kinds of forces of opposition</p>
<p>within Iran itself.</p>
<p>Prevent further revolution.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s the revolutionary guards,</p>
<p>and their job was to try to make sure</p>
<p>that the regime stays in power.</p>
<p>And of course, over the course of 40 years,</p>
<p>they became more powerful, more organized,</p>
<p>better funded, better trained.</p>
<p>Well, at least we think they&rsquo;re better trained,</p>
<p>but we don&rsquo;t know, because the level of incompetence</p>
<p>perhaps can be seen through their rank and file as well.</p>
<p>But, you know, they developed their own military industry.</p>
<p>I mean, those drones that you see now,</p>
<p>Putin&rsquo;s regime are throwing on Ukrainians,</p>
<p>poor Ukrainians.</p>
<p>Those are all built by the revolutionary guards,</p>
<p>by the military industry under the control</p>
<p>of the revolutionary guards.</p>
<p>And like similar regimes in the Middle East, at least,</p>
<p>these are military-industrial complexes.</p>
<p>You can find them in Egypt, of course,</p>
<p>which is very powerful, very traditional,</p>
<p>has been in power and still is in power.</p>
<p>You find them in Pakistan, which is extremely powerful,</p>
<p>and they can change the prime ministers</p>
<p>as they did in the case of the last one.</p>
<p>You can find them probably in Myanmar,</p>
<p>is the same phenomenon.</p>
<p>And I can, if you look around,</p>
<p>you can find quite a number of them.</p>
<p>And the revolutionary guards is equivalent of that.</p>
<p>This is a powerful establishment force,</p>
<p>which militarily is powerful, industrially is powerful.</p>
<p>And since the start of the revolution,</p>
<p>they have been given projects.</p>
<p>So you want to build dams,</p>
<p>which they did a major disaster, environmental disaster.</p>
<p>They built 100 and something dams all across the country.</p>
<p>This is the revolutionary guard who does it.</p>
<p>So they have all kinds of tentacles</p>
<p>all around the country, controlling various things.</p>
<p>And because it&rsquo;s their job,</p>
<p>and they have power, they have prestige,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a huge incentive to-</p>
<p>Join them.</p>
<p>To join them and to stay.</p>
<p>So like they, you know,</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re having dinner at home with their families,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s not an incentive to join the protests, sort of.</p>
<p>Well, that is the point.</p>
<p>I think, the revolutionary guards may be an extreme,</p>
<p>but many of the people who depend on the state</p>
<p>for their support,</p>
<p>now the younger generation are telling their parents,</p>
<p>you are wrong.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t provide for us, this society,</p>
<p>this state does not provide what we want.</p>
<p>So there is a dissent within the family, it seems to me.</p>
<p>I hope it&rsquo;s not a wishful thinking.</p>
<p>You know, there is a kind of a joke going around.</p>
<p>You see these determined guys,</p>
<p>the clergy, bearded, traditional clerical appearance.</p>
<p>When you see them talking about women,</p>
<p>they are very, of course, politically incorrect.</p>
<p>They are very looking down towards women.</p>
<p>As I said, you know,</p>
<p>they have to be inside, they have to be protected,</p>
<p>they have not to be seen, and so forth.</p>
<p>But if they have a young person,</p>
<p>a young daughter in their family,</p>
<p>you see that their discourse changes.</p>
<p>They no longer seem to be referring to women</p>
<p>as second-class citizens.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s very important.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s precisely that point,</p>
<p>that when you have this younger generation,</p>
<p>no matter how privileged they are,</p>
<p>and many of them are privileged, you know,</p>
<p>and there is also the regime has created</p>
<p>its own privilege class</p>
<p>that are not necessarily directly paid by the regime,</p>
<p>but they benefit from contractors,</p>
<p>certain professions that benefit</p>
<p>from what the state provides for them.</p>
<p>And Iran is a, I mean, the past 40 years,</p>
<p>you can see Iran has developed,</p>
<p>in terms of material culture, remarkably.</p>
<p>Iran has good communication, has roads all over the place.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like, it&rsquo;s more like,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know whether you have ever visited Turkey,</p>
<p>for instance.</p>
<p>In certain respects, even more advanced than Turkey,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s closer to that, rather than if you travel,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to bring particular names,</p>
<p>in North Africa, or parts of the Middle East,</p>
<p>or other parts of the Islamic world.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s much, much different.</p>
<p>So in this respect, you would see</p>
<p>certain contrast or paradoxes here.</p>
<p>On the certain respect, there is the growth,</p>
<p>and there is urbanization, there is modern economy.</p>
<p>On the other hand, you see this superimposed,</p>
<p>ideological, doctrinal aspect</p>
<p>that has driven the regime over all these years.</p>
<p>And they cannot get rid of it.</p>
<p>They cannot, in this respect,</p>
<p>they cannot modernize themselves.</p>
<p>They think that they are already perfect,</p>
<p>in ideological sense, this is the best solution</p>
<p>for the world.</p>
<p>Not only for Iran, but for the Muslim world,</p>
<p>and for the world as a whole.</p>
<p>We are anti-imperialist.</p>
<p>We have managed to survive, either under sanctions,</p>
<p>this is all part of their rhetoric.</p>
<p>But of course, at the huge expense,</p>
<p>the huge expense for their own population.</p>
<p>And the point that you have raised</p>
<p>is the fact that we now witness</p>
<p>there is not only a generation gap</p>
<p>between the youth and their parents,</p>
<p>but there is a break, in a sense,</p>
<p>from the older generations.</p>
<p>And they are very distinctly the youth</p>
<p>that has a different view of the world.</p>
<p>And does not want to compromise.</p>
<p>Whether they would be able to succeed or not</p>
<p>remains to be seen.</p>
<p>Whether this regime is going to suppress it, maybe.</p>
<p>But it actually brought to surface</p>
<p>many of aspects of the weaknesses of this regime in power.</p>
<p>Well, I hear from a lot of people</p>
<p>that are in these protests now,</p>
<p>and so my love goes to them, and stay strong.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s inspiring to see people</p>
<p>fighting for those things,</p>
<p>the women, life, and freedom, especially freedom.</p>
<p>Because that can only lead to a good thing</p>
<p>in the long term, at least.</p>
<p>And if possible, to avoid a violent revolution.</p>
<p>Of course, that is something that we all want to see.</p>
<p>Before we return to the present,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s jump around, let&rsquo;s go to the past.</p>
<p>We mentioned 1979.</p>
<p>What happened in 1979 in Iran?</p>
<p>Well, in 1979, there was a revolution</p>
<p>that eventually came to be known as the Islamic Revolution.</p>
<p>And even up to this day, many of the observers,</p>
<p>or those who have strong views,</p>
<p>that would not like to refer to it as an Islamic Revolution,</p>
<p>or even a revolution.</p>
<p>Because the nature of it, in the earlier stages of it,</p>
<p>started really probably around 1977, it took two years,</p>
<p>was much more all-embracing.</p>
<p>It was not Islamic in a particular fashion,</p>
<p>or at all, in a sense.</p>
<p>It started with a kind of a very liberal,</p>
<p>Democrat agenda, which required,</p>
<p>which demanded, mostly by people who were the veterans</p>
<p>of the older generations of Iranian liberal nationalists</p>
<p>that were left out in the Pahlavi period.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a period of the Shah became increasingly authoritarian,</p>
<p>increasingly suppressive,</p>
<p>and therefore, basically,</p>
<p>leaving no space, no political space,</p>
<p>open for any kind of a give-and-take,</p>
<p>any kind of a conversation or participation.</p>
<p>That was in the 70s.</p>
<p>70s, 70s, particularly in the 70s.</p>
<p>Can we actually even just do a whirlwind review</p>
<p>from 1906 to 1979?</p>
<p>Okay, sure.</p>
<p>In 1906, there was a period, actually, as you might know,</p>
<p>the first decade or so of the 20th century</p>
<p>witnessed numerous, what we refer to</p>
<p>as constitutional revolutions,</p>
<p>including Russia in 1905, the first revolution,</p>
<p>including the Chinese Revolution in 19,</p>
<p>Constitutional Revolution in 1910,</p>
<p>the Young Turks Revolution in 1908,</p>
<p>and the Iranian Revolution in 1906.</p>
<p>Do I understand why the synchronicity of all of it,</p>
<p>why in so many different places, very different cultures,</p>
<p>very different governments?</p>
<p>Very different cultures, but all of them, in a sense,</p>
<p>were coming out of regimes</p>
<p>that became progressively powerful</p>
<p>without having any kind of a legal system</p>
<p>that would protect the individual vis-a-vis the state.</p>
<p>So the idea of law and the constitution,</p>
<p>according to which there should be a certain protection,</p>
<p>a certain civil society, became very common.</p>
<p>Yeah, but I wonder where that,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s been that way for a very, very long time,</p>
<p>and so I wonder, you know, it&rsquo;s funny,</p>
<p>certain ideas, just their time comes.</p>
<p>Exactly, it&rsquo;s like 1848, when you would see</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a whole range of revolutions across Europe,</p>
<p>or you would see, for instance, the Arab Spring.</p>
<p>You see all these revolutions in the Arab world,</p>
<p>which unfortunately, nearly all of them failed.</p>
<p>So yes, these are very contagious ideas</p>
<p>that moves across frontiers from one culture to another,</p>
<p>and I presume we can add to that there are two elements</p>
<p>which one can say there was a greater communication,</p>
<p>there is a greater sense of a world economy,</p>
<p>and the turn of the century witnessed,</p>
<p>the first decade of the century witnessed</p>
<p>a period of volatility, particularly in currency.</p>
<p>So many of the countries of the world,</p>
<p>particularly non-West, suffered in,</p>
<p>and particularly the businesses suffered,</p>
<p>and not surprisingly, the business class</p>
<p>were in the forefront of many</p>
<p>of these constitutional movements,</p>
<p>requiring the state to give the kind of a,</p>
<p>create the right kind of institutions</p>
<p>to listen to their voices, to their concerns,</p>
<p>and the creation of a democratic system,</p>
<p>parliamentary system in which there would be</p>
<p>a representation, popular representation,</p>
<p>proper elections and so forth, and constitutions.</p>
<p>And this very much is a kind of a French idea</p>
<p>of the constitution going back all the way,</p>
<p>perhaps to 1789 revolution, Montesquieu,</p>
<p>all this kind of philosophes were greatly appreciated,</p>
<p>particularly the French system.</p>
<p>So what were the ideas in the 1906 Iranian constitution?</p>
<p>They, precisely the same, they were demanding</p>
<p>a creation of a legal system with division of power</p>
<p>between the three, executive, legislative,</p>
<p>and the judiciary, not unlike the American system.</p>
<p>And they requested basically a certain public space</p>
<p>to be created between the two sources of power,</p>
<p>the state, which had this kind of a control</p>
<p>over the, if you like, the secular aspect of life</p>
<p>in the society, and the religious establishment</p>
<p>that had a full control over the religious aspects.</p>
<p>And both of them, from the perspective of the constitution,</p>
<p>this is considered as repressive,</p>
<p>and therefore there has to be a new space</p>
<p>open between these two.</p>
<p>And that was the idea of a constitutional revolution.</p>
<p>By its very nature, it was an idea of modernity.</p>
<p>They wanted a modern society.</p>
<p>They wanted a better material life.</p>
<p>They wanted more representation and so forth.</p>
<p>The constitutional revolution, as I always would say,</p>
<p>is much more of an innocent revolution.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a revolution that did not particularly</p>
<p>have much violence in it, contrary to many other revolutions.</p>
<p>It did not have a centralized leadership, per se.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why, actually, I&rsquo;m getting,</p>
<p>I mean, besides the practices,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m getting a lot of requests for interviews</p>
<p>to compare what&rsquo;s happening now</p>
<p>with the revolution of 1906, 1909.</p>
<p>Are there any echoes?</p>
<p>Yes, yes, there are, there are.</p>
<p>Because that was a movement that started</p>
<p>without a centralized leadership,</p>
<p>but actually various voices that emerged</p>
<p>in various, among the merchants,</p>
<p>or the businessmen in the economic community,</p>
<p>among the representatives who came to the first parliament,</p>
<p>the press, the new generation of the privileged aristocracy</p>
<p>who were educated and believed in the constitutional values.</p>
<p>All of these voices emerged at the same time.</p>
<p>And somehow, they managed to co-exist</p>
<p>in the first and the second parliaments</p>
<p>that were created between 1906 and 1910 or 1911.</p>
<p>But they all faced huge problems,</p>
<p>in the sense that Iran was in a dire economic situation.</p>
<p>This is before the days of the discovery of oil,</p>
<p>which actually coincides with the discovery.</p>
<p>There are two important coincidences.</p>
<p>One is that the oil was discovered in the South in 1909,</p>
<p>during the course of the Constitutional Revolution.</p>
<p>Second is that in 1907, the two great powers of the time,</p>
<p>the Russian Empire and the British Empire,</p>
<p>who always honored Iran as being a buffer state</p>
<p>between them, because they didn&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>to get too close to one another,</p>
<p>basically came to an agreement facing the fear</p>
<p>of the rise of the German Empire.</p>
<p>So this is the period of Entente,</p>
<p>as you might know in European history,</p>
<p>whereby the French, the British, and the Russians</p>
<p>all create an alliance that ultimately leads</p>
<p>to the First World War against Germany.</p>
<p>And at the same time, the discovery of oil,</p>
<p>that the oil industry being a very powerful,</p>
<p>defining factor of the 20th century for Iran.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Source of a lot of money.</p>
<p>Lot of money, but not all of it in the hands</p>
<p>of the Iranians.</p>
<p>Only one-fifth of it, by way of royalties,</p>
<p>came to Iran.</p>
<p>Much of it went to the Anglo-Persian oil company,</p>
<p>which they actually discovered the oil in the province,</p>
<p>Khuzestan province in the southwest of Iran,</p>
<p>where the major oil industry is today, right now.</p>
<p>And this was an extremely profitable enterprise</p>
<p>for that company and for the British government.</p>
<p>It was actually purchased by the British government.</p>
<p>Churchill purchased Anglo-Iranian oil company</p>
<p>for the British government.</p>
<p>So it was not anymore a private company.</p>
<p>It was a British interest, as a matter of fact.</p>
<p>And in the course of the 20th century,</p>
<p>although it helped the modernization in Iran,</p>
<p>but it also helped the creation of a more authoritarian,</p>
<p>more strong state, if you like to call it,</p>
<p>that 19th century Iran never had that kind of a power,</p>
<p>never had that kind of resources.</p>
<p>Is it 20th century?</p>
<p>Even that one-fifth of the income</p>
<p>that reached the Iranian state gave it a greater power.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s another coincidence.</p>
<p>So yes, you could say the oil was one of the catalysts</p>
<p>for absolute power, but the 20th century</p>
<p>saw quite a few countries have dictators with power</p>
<p>unlike anything else in human history.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s weird, too.</p>
<p>Precisely.</p>
<p>And you can name them from the beginning of the century</p>
<p>with people like, I don&rsquo;t know, Lenin, Stalin,</p>
<p>of course, Hitler, even Mao, of course.</p>
<p>You can name them, and probably, as I would say,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the last of them is Khomeini in that century</p>
<p>that you would see this strong man</p>
<p>with a sense of either artificial or real,</p>
<p>or a sense of so-called charisma,</p>
<p>and with this total power over the regime that they create.</p>
<p>Some of them do, Nasser, he didn&rsquo;t have much</p>
<p>of an oil resources in Egypt,</p>
<p>but he was also one of these strong men, okay,</p>
<p>in the 20th century, loved by some, hated by others.</p>
<p>So it necessarily does not tie up</p>
<p>to economic resources on the ground,</p>
<p>but in the Iranian case, unfortunately, it did.</p>
<p>And it was a, it was more than,</p>
<p>it created more than one issue for Iran.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s created a strong state, which is the Pahlavi state,</p>
<p>from 1921 onward.</p>
<p>Because in 1921, at the end of the First World War,</p>
<p>Iran was in almost a state of total bankruptcy.</p>
<p>And the British had a desire to try to bring Iran</p>
<p>to the system that they created in the Middle East</p>
<p>in the post-war era, the mandate system.</p>
<p>Palestine, Iraq, and then, of course,</p>
<p>French mandate of Lebanon and Syria, all of this.</p>
<p>And Iran was separate</p>
<p>because Iran was an independent country.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t part of the Ottoman Empire that collapsed.</p>
<p>So they had to somehow handle it.</p>
<p>And what they tried to do didn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>As a result, partly domestic, partly international issues,</p>
<p>wrote about a regime which is headed</p>
<p>by the founder of the Pahlavi dynasty, Reza Shah.</p>
<p>Okay, a first military officer called Reza Khan,</p>
<p>actually a military officer of the Cossack forces.</p>
<p>And the Cossack forces was the force</p>
<p>that was created in the 19th century</p>
<p>model of the Russian Cossacks.</p>
<p>When the ruler in the 19th century visited Russia</p>
<p>as in a royal tour, and the desire showed</p>
<p>the great Cossack forces, he said, I like this.</p>
<p>And he created one for himself</p>
<p>with Russian officers, actually.</p>
<p>So Russian officers served in Iran from around 1880s</p>
<p>up to the revolution of 1917,</p>
<p>the collapse of the Cossack regime.</p>
<p>So many revolutions.</p>
<p>So many revolutions.</p>
<p>And Reza Shah was an officer in that, Reza Khan</p>
<p>was an officer in that force.</p>
<p>And he created a new monarchy for reasons</p>
<p>that we need not to go to.</p>
<p>And this called the Pahlavi regime.</p>
<p>Pahlavi regime was a modernizing regime, okay?</p>
<p>That brought, in effect, fulfilled many of the ambitions</p>
<p>of the Constitution, many of the aspirations</p>
<p>of the Constitutional Revolution.</p>
<p>Better communication, secular education,</p>
<p>centralized state, centralized army,</p>
<p>better contact with the outside world,</p>
<p>greater urbanization.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what a modern state is all about.</p>
<p>And in that regard, in a sense, for the first 20 years</p>
<p>up to the Second World War, was successful.</p>
<p>Despite, and more significant of all,</p>
<p>it managed to keep the European powers,</p>
<p>which was always interfering in the local affairs of Iran,</p>
<p>in an arm&rsquo;s length.</p>
<p>So they were there in an arm&rsquo;s length,</p>
<p>but they were also respecting the power of the state,</p>
<p>power of the Pahlavi state.</p>
<p>During the Second World War,</p>
<p>the same phenomenon as earlier interference</p>
<p>led to the occupation of Iran by the Allied forces.</p>
<p>The British from the south, the Russians from the north.</p>
<p>The Red Army, they took over Iran.</p>
<p>And of course, they said-</p>
<p>The Second World War.</p>
<p>Yes, from 1941 up to 1945.</p>
<p>And of course, when the Red Army refused to withdraw</p>
<p>from Iranian Azerbaijan, and with some thought</p>
<p>of possible annexation of that province,</p>
<p>there was a big issue in the post-war Iran.</p>
<p>So after 1945-</p>
<p>Yes, 1945 to 1946, there was a big-</p>
<p>Soviet Union getting greedy.</p>
<p>Yes, but eventually they agreed.</p>
<p>Eventually, Stalin agreed to leave the Azerbaijan province</p>
<p>in the hope that it would get some concessions from Iran,</p>
<p>which in the oil of the Caspian area,</p>
<p>which didn&rsquo;t work, and it&rsquo;s a different story altogether.</p>
<p>But what happened is that in the post-war era,</p>
<p>between 1944, 45, and 1953,</p>
<p>is a period of greater democratization,</p>
<p>was that Reza Shah&rsquo;s dictatorship basically disappeared.</p>
<p>And this is where you would see political parties,</p>
<p>free press, a lot of chaotic, really,</p>
<p>as democracies often are.</p>
<p>So something like, was it officially a democracy?</p>
<p>Yes, it was a democracy.</p>
<p>Was there elections?</p>
<p>There were elections, yes, of course, yes, of course.</p>
<p>And there were very diverse political tendencies</p>
<p>came to the picture, including the Tudeh Party of Iran,</p>
<p>which is Communist Party of Iran.</p>
<p>This Communist Party of Iran is probably</p>
<p>the biggest Communist Party of the whole of the Middle East,</p>
<p>and one of the biggest in the world, actually, at that time.</p>
<p>Did the Soviet Union have a significant influence on the-</p>
<p>Of course, they were basically following orders</p>
<p>from the Soviets, although they denied it,</p>
<p>but in reality, that&rsquo;s the case.</p>
<p>But what happened, they were seen by the Americans</p>
<p>during the Cold War as a threat,</p>
<p>and Iran was going through a period</p>
<p>of demanding nationalization of its oil resources.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a very important episode, with Mossadegh,</p>
<p>whom you might have heard about his name.</p>
<p>Dr. Mohammad Mossadegh, who was the prime minister</p>
<p>and the national charismatic leader from 1951 to 1953.</p>
<p>Prior to that, he was a famous parliamentarian,</p>
<p>but this period, he was the prime minister of Iran,</p>
<p>and he nationalized the Iranian oil industry,</p>
<p>and the British didn&rsquo;t like it at all,</p>
<p>and eventually resulted in a famous coup,</p>
<p>which at least partly was supported by the funding</p>
<p>and by the moral support of the British and the Americans,</p>
<p>particularly by the Americans.</p>
<p>It was always seen as one of the earliest</p>
<p>and the most successful CIA operations during the Cold War.</p>
<p>So CIA had something to do with it?</p>
<p>Yes, of course, that&rsquo;s one of the earliest operations</p>
<p>of the CIA.</p>
<p>Wait a minute, what was, yes, of course,</p>
<p>what was the CIA doing?</p>
<p>CIA, this is the time at the post-war era.</p>
<p>In the 50s.</p>
<p>In the 50s, 40s and the 50s.</p>
<p>The British Empire, which was really the major superpower</p>
<p>of the region after the collapse of the Tzarist Empire,</p>
<p>gradually took the second seat to the Americans,</p>
<p>who were the newcomers and the great powers</p>
<p>and the victors of the Second World War,</p>
<p>and the Americans viewed Iran as an important,</p>
<p>as an important country,</p>
<p>since it has the largest common borders</p>
<p>with the Soviet Union,</p>
<p>and it was, indeed, the South was the Persian Gulf,</p>
<p>which at the time was the greatest</p>
<p>supplier of oil to the outside world,</p>
<p>and therefore the Americans</p>
<p>had a particular interest in Iran.</p>
<p>And in the earlier stages, their interest</p>
<p>was in the interest of the Iranian government,</p>
<p>because they wanted to get rid of both the Soviet Union,</p>
<p>which made a return in the post-war era,</p>
<p>and, of course, the British</p>
<p>that were gradually withdrawing from Iran.</p>
<p>But they had a full control</p>
<p>over the Anglo-Iranian oil company.</p>
<p>They changed the name to Anglo-Iranian Oil Company.</p>
<p>When the name of the country officially changed</p>
<p>from Persia to Iran, in the West,</p>
<p>the name of the company changed.</p>
<p>And they got into a huge dispute</p>
<p>with the other government</p>
<p>that eventually led to the coup of 1953,</p>
<p>which eventually created a very,</p>
<p>a very distressful memory</p>
<p>in the minds of many of the Iranian nationalists,</p>
<p>that this was the betrayal of the great powers,</p>
<p>the British and Americans.</p>
<p>Yes, CIA played a part,</p>
<p>because CIA feared, contrary to the British,</p>
<p>that they were afraid of their own oil in Iran,</p>
<p>the CIA was afraid of the Soviet penetration</p>
<p>in the South, and particularly</p>
<p>because there was a very powerful Communist Party</p>
<p>in Iran, the Tudeh Party of Iran.</p>
<p>So they gradually shifted</p>
<p>between the Truman administration</p>
<p>and our Eisenhower administration.</p>
<p>These are early days of the CIA.</p>
<p>And then they actually did participate</p>
<p>to send their agents.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a long story to that.</p>
<p>And it eventually resulted in a successful coup</p>
<p>that removed Mossadegh from power.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the United States&rsquo; interest here?</p>
<p>Why are they using CIA?</p>
<p>Are they trying to make sure</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s not too much centralization of power</p>
<p>in this region?</p>
<p>They were afraid of the fact that the,</p>
<p>that of the Soviet Union,</p>
<p>and during the Cold War, that was their concern.</p>
<p>Only concern.</p>
<p>They actually almost want to protect Iran</p>
<p>and its own sovereign processes</p>
<p>from the influence of the Soviets.</p>
<p>Because they were afraid of the fact</p>
<p>if Iran, or at least this is part of the,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m simplifying a very complex picture,</p>
<p>but the Americans basically were thinking</p>
<p>that if Iran is going to be lost</p>
<p>to Soviet influence,</p>
<p>then eventually, basically, all the oil resources</p>
<p>in the Persian Gulf are going to be threatened.</p>
<p>And this would basically is the national security</p>
<p>of the United States and all of the Western allies,</p>
<p>European allies.</p>
<p>So in a sense, this was the long arm of the CIA</p>
<p>to try to make sure that that&rsquo;s not going to happen.</p>
<p>And then, of course, they were persuaded by the British.</p>
<p>British were the old hand,</p>
<p>which were in Iran since the beginning of the 19th century.</p>
<p>They always had relations with Iran and so forth.</p>
<p>So they gradually replaced.</p>
<p>And of course, I don&rsquo;t want to give them</p>
<p>this kind of a satanic view</p>
<p>that the Americans was a bad influence,</p>
<p>because they had also some very good influences in Iran.</p>
<p>But this particular episode somehow shed a dark light</p>
<p>on the American presence and was used</p>
<p>that abused time and again,</p>
<p>particularly the revolution in 1979,</p>
<p>which was this great Satan idea that Khomeini created,</p>
<p>basically was based on the fact is,</p>
<p>1953, you were responsible for the downfall</p>
<p>of a national government in Iran,</p>
<p>which as a matter of fact, he had no respect for it.</p>
<p>Khomeini had no respect for the secular,</p>
<p>nationally liberals, including Mohammad Mossadegh.</p>
<p>But he was using it as a rhetorical tool</p>
<p>for his own purposes.</p>
<p>But what happened is that after 1953,</p>
<p>we see again the rise of authoritarian</p>
<p>Mohammad Reza Shah&rsquo;s power.</p>
<p>And that he is, that&rsquo;s the Shah?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the Shah that we know as Shah.</p>
<p>This is son of Reza Shah.</p>
<p>And technically, what is Shah?</p>
<p>Shah is an old term in Persian</p>
<p>that comes from a pre-Islamic Persian of ancient times.</p>
<p>So in the context of democracy,</p>
<p>should it be seen as like a supreme leader, king?</p>
<p>Is the head of the executive power,</p>
<p>according to the Constitution of 1906.</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s in the Constitution, the actual term Shah.</p>
<p>Of course, he has a place in the Constitution.</p>
<p>But the actual term Shah, okay, interesting.</p>
<p>But the Shah is a very old term.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s almost like a monarchic term, like a king.</p>
<p>Yeah, it is, actually is a term peculiar to Iran.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve written about it somewhere.</p>
<p>But because the term, the Western word in the ancient times</p>
<p>has been Rex for royalty and the king.</p>
<p>In the Eastern world, in India, is Raj,</p>
<p>is the same origin, the same root.</p>
<p>Iran never shared that.</p>
<p>They had the idea of, because Rex and Raj,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to get into too much of etymology,</p>
<p>but this is an interesting one.</p>
<p>Rex and Raj both means the one that opens the road</p>
<p>for basically enforcer of religion, okay?</p>
<p>Enforcer of the right religion.</p>
<p>Because Rex and Raj both have the,</p>
<p>of the etymological origin of right, you see?</p>
<p>And right means the right religion, basically.</p>
<p>By the way, there&rsquo;s so much beautiful language here.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just looking at the Persian Constitution in 1906,</p>
<p>and it says it&rsquo;s the constitution</p>
<p>of the sublime state of Persia, Qajar Iran.</p>
<p>I mean, just the extra adjectives</p>
<p>on top of this stuff is beautiful.</p>
<p>Yeah, because that was actually the change that came about.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to go too much into it.</p>
<p>But it was called, as I pointed out before,</p>
<p>the guarded domains of Iran.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>They changed that to the sublime state of Iran</p>
<p>during the constitutional revolution.</p>
<p>Because they wanted to give a greater sense</p>
<p>of centrality of this state.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And sublime was the term we used.</p>
<p>But also, what permeates all of this is a poetic,</p>
<p>I mean, there is a history of poetry.</p>
<p>Of course, very strong.</p>
<p>To the culture, which is fascinating.</p>
<p>So I mean, it&rsquo;s, of course I don&rsquo;t speak the language,</p>
<p>but even in Russian, there&rsquo;s also a music</p>
<p>to the soul of the people that represents itself,</p>
<p>that presents itself in the form of poetry and literature</p>
<p>in the way that it doesn&rsquo;t in the English-speaking world.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what that is.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a&hellip;</p>
<p>Yes, there&rsquo;s a romantic side.</p>
<p>Romantic side.</p>
<p>Romantic side, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Yeah, I agree with you.</p>
<p>In Iran, of course, you know,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a time of the constitutional revolution,</p>
<p>is a time of great poetry.</p>
<p>This kind of a patriotic sentiment that comes</p>
<p>through poetry plays a very important part.</p>
<p>Of course, these days, poetry has kind of declined.</p>
<p>And instead, you see the visual image</p>
<p>that is at the center.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why cinema is so important.</p>
<p>Kids these days with their TikTok.</p>
<p>Yeah, let me finish this about the period</p>
<p>of Muhammad Reza Shah.</p>
<p>He built up, because he received a greater income</p>
<p>from the oil revenue, and he built up a very strong state</p>
<p>with a strong security force, a strong security apparatus,</p>
<p>which is the SAVAK, which is an acronym</p>
<p>for the security force in security organization.</p>
<p>And he, of course, unfortunately,</p>
<p>in the 1960s and 70s, particularly in 1970s,</p>
<p>basically suppressed the voices of, or possibility</p>
<p>of any kind of a mass participation</p>
<p>in the political process.</p>
<p>It became very much an authoritarian regime</p>
<p>with its own technocrats, very much a modernist vision</p>
<p>of Iran&rsquo;s future, and almost kind of messianic</p>
<p>that he was hoping that Iran in a decade</p>
<p>would become the fifth most powerful state in the world.</p>
<p>And the riches, as he would have said,</p>
<p>the gates of the great civilization,</p>
<p>very much in the mind had this image of ancient Iran</p>
<p>of the Achaemenid Empire.</p>
<p>And we want to go back to that greatness</p>
<p>of the Achaemenid Empire.</p>
<p>Somewhat rather naive and very nationalistic</p>
<p>in a crude fashion.</p>
<p>And what happened is that, as a result,</p>
<p>there was built up some kind of a resistance</p>
<p>from the intellectuals, from the left,</p>
<p>eventually resulting in a kind of a protest movement,</p>
<p>as I said, by 1977, 1978.</p>
<p>Then, of course, the question that comes to mind,</p>
<p>and that probably you would like to know about,</p>
<p>is the fact that why it becomes religious?</p>
<p>Why it become Islamic?</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s the popular nationalist, liberal tendency</p>
<p>of opening up the political space</p>
<p>and allowing greater participation,</p>
<p>going back to the constitution of 1906, 1907,</p>
<p>why it&rsquo;s all of a sudden it becomes Khomeini,</p>
<p>where does he come from?</p>
<p>The reason for that, at least in a concise fashion,</p>
<p>is the fact that on one area</p>
<p>that, after the greater suppression</p>
<p>of all the other voices, remained open was religion.</p>
<p>Mosques, the mullahs on the pulpit,</p>
<p>and the message that gradually shifted</p>
<p>from all the traditional message of the sharia of Islam,</p>
<p>I mean, all the rules and regulations</p>
<p>of how one has to live, into something very political.</p>
<p>And not only political, but also radical political.</p>
<p>So, in the whole period from the constitutional revolution</p>
<p>to the revolution of 1979,</p>
<p>basically the religious establishment</p>
<p>gradually was pushed to the opposition.</p>
<p>They were not originally very conservative supporters</p>
<p>of the state, as the Catholic Church, for instance,</p>
<p>was a supporter of the majority</p>
<p>of the authoritarian governments around the world.</p>
<p>But the politicization was the result of isolation,</p>
<p>because they were left out of the system.</p>
<p>And while in isolation, they did not,</p>
<p>they were not successful in trying to reform themselves,</p>
<p>to try to become, to try to find answers</p>
<p>to many of the questions of modern times.</p>
<p>What happens to women?</p>
<p>What happens to civil rights?</p>
<p>What happens to a civil society?</p>
<p>How modern law and individual freedoms</p>
<p>have to be defined in Islamic terms?</p>
<p>How to separate religion and state?</p>
<p>Or how to separate the religion and state?</p>
<p>These issues were never addressed.</p>
<p>What happened is that there was this bypass</p>
<p>through political Islam, and revolutionary Islam,</p>
<p>as it gradually, they learned, you know,</p>
<p>that this is the bypass, bypass to power, basically.</p>
<p>To become, again, a voice in the society,</p>
<p>and eventually a prominent voice,</p>
<p>and eventually a monolithic voice in the society.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the process that led into the revolution of 1979,</p>
<p>basically.</p>
<p>This period, greater attention was paid to religion,</p>
<p>even among the secular middle classes,</p>
<p>who were alienated for a very long time</p>
<p>because of this extensive modernization</p>
<p>of the Pahlavi period.</p>
<p>They had, they didn&rsquo;t have a sense</p>
<p>of that old mullahs with their turbans.</p>
<p>But they became, they had a kind of aura in this period.</p>
<p>Yes, they are those who remained not corrupted.</p>
<p>They are the people who basically went against</p>
<p>the suppression of the Pahlavi regime.</p>
<p>And Khomeini became a leader, a symbol of that.</p>
<p>Nobody ever thought in the earlier stages,</p>
<p>among these very excited multitudes</p>
<p>that came to the streets of the Iranian cities</p>
<p>in 1979, or 1978, actually,</p>
<p>thought that this old mullah in the 70s,</p>
<p>that all of a sudden has appeared from the Najaf</p>
<p>through Paris to Tehran, is going to take over</p>
<p>and create a autocracy, a religious autocracy.</p>
<p>We have to back up for just a second.</p>
<p>Who is Khomeini?</p>
<p>You just mentioned a few disparate facts about the man.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>He was the person that took power in 1979,</p>
<p>the supreme leader of Iran.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>You mentioned something about Paris,</p>
<p>something about being in the 70s.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>What should we know about the guy?</p>
<p>Ayatollah Khomeini, who eventually was known</p>
<p>as Imam Khomeini, he was kind of promoted</p>
<p>to an even more sublime position.</p>
<p>Okay, can we, just a million tangents.</p>
<p>Ayatollah, Imam, what do these terms mean?</p>
<p>Well, Ayatollah means the sign of God.</p>
<p>In the course of the 19th century, or early 20th century,</p>
<p>as the religious establishment gradually lost</p>
<p>its greater presence in the society</p>
<p>and its prominent places in society,</p>
<p>they had some kind of an inflation in titles.</p>
<p>So they gave themselves more grand titles.</p>
<p>Yeah, more adjectives.</p>
<p>More adjectives, more grand titles, such as Ayatollah,</p>
<p>that became a kind of a highest rank</p>
<p>of the religious hierarchy.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not-</p>
<p>It really was in an unofficial hierarchy.</p>
<p>It was not, it&rsquo;s not like the Catholic Church</p>
<p>that you have, you know, bishops and, you know,</p>
<p>further off.</p>
<p>It was very unofficial model.</p>
<p>And he was an Ayatollah, was eventually recognized</p>
<p>as an Ayatollah.</p>
<p>He wasn&rsquo;t the first Ayatollah?</p>
<p>No, no, no, not at all.</p>
<p>The Ayatollahs were before him,</p>
<p>ever since the beginning of the century.</p>
<p>But he was eventually recognized as an Ayatollah.</p>
<p>And if I want to start it this way,</p>
<p>Ayatollah Khomeini was born in 1900.</p>
<p>And in a sense, all this tremendous change</p>
<p>that Iran witnessed in the course of the 20th century,</p>
<p>was in a sense, materializing this person.</p>
<p>He become a mullah of a lower rank,</p>
<p>went to the traditional madrasas,</p>
<p>to the traditional centers for the education</p>
<p>of the seminarians, never had a secular education,</p>
<p>had a very complex Islamic education</p>
<p>on this one hand jurisprudence, on the other hand,</p>
<p>probably a little bit of Islamic philosophy</p>
<p>and mysticism, which is unusual for the jurists,</p>
<p>for the faqih, as they call them,</p>
<p>these religious scholars or legal scholars of Islam.</p>
<p>And then he, in the 1960s,</p>
<p>when he was residing in Tehran</p>
<p>and gradually becoming more important,</p>
<p>he became a voice of opposition against the Shah.</p>
<p>And the reason for opposition in the early 1960s</p>
<p>was the fact that the Shah carried through a series</p>
<p>of extensive modernization policies,</p>
<p>of which the most important was the land reform.</p>
<p>So in effect, the land distribution that took place</p>
<p>in the early 60s removed or weakened greatly</p>
<p>that class of landowners from the 19th century.</p>
<p>And he, Khomeini, saw himself as a voice</p>
<p>of that old class that felt,</p>
<p>that actually declared that this land redistribution</p>
<p>is un-Islamic according to the Islamic law,</p>
<p>property is honored,</p>
<p>and you cannot just, no matter how much</p>
<p>and how large are these estates</p>
<p>that the landowning class has,</p>
<p>the government has no right to redistribute it,</p>
<p>even among the peasants, among the people</p>
<p>who are tilling the land.</p>
<p>So that was a major issue.</p>
<p>Shah also gave the right of vote to women,</p>
<p>and that also, he objected.</p>
<p>He said, women should not have a right.</p>
<p>Can we just linger on the Islamic law?</p>
<p>How firm and clear is the Islamic law</p>
<p>that he was representing and embodying?</p>
<p>Is this-</p>
<p>Codified?</p>
<p>Codified, yes, that&rsquo;s a good term.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s another issue.</p>
<p>Not only the hierarchy was unofficial and informal,</p>
<p>but also Islamic law, particularly Shi&rsquo;i law,</p>
<p>did not have any codified system,</p>
<p>because these religious authorities always resisted</p>
<p>becoming under an umbrella of a more codified system</p>
<p>of Islamic law, because they were outside the state,</p>
<p>in a sense.</p>
<p>Civil law was in the hand of the religious establishment.</p>
<p>They had their own courts, independent of the state.</p>
<p>But other matters, legal matters,</p>
<p>was in the hand of the government.</p>
<p>There was a kind of de facto division</p>
<p>between these two institutions,</p>
<p>state versus the religious establishment.</p>
<p>Therefore, it was not codified.</p>
<p>So he could declare that this is unofficial,</p>
<p>or sorry, illegal, according to the Islamic law,</p>
<p>that you would distribute land to the peasants.</p>
<p>And another mujtahid, or another religious authority,</p>
<p>would say, no, no, it is perfectly fine,</p>
<p>because he has a different reading of the law.</p>
<p>So that being in mind,</p>
<p>that adds to the complexity of the picture.</p>
<p>In 1963, there was a period of uprising</p>
<p>of the supporters of Ayatollah Khomeini.</p>
<p>That was a turning point, in a sense,</p>
<p>to try to politicize the religious supporters</p>
<p>of Ayatollah, who were loyal to Ayatollah Khomeini.</p>
<p>And in a sense, all the community</p>
<p>of more religiously orientated,</p>
<p>against the secular policies of the Shah,</p>
<p>and against, of course, the dictatorship of the Shah.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s where the religious movement</p>
<p>became a political party.</p>
<p>Became, in 1963 is the first moment.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a huge uprising, and the government suppressed it.</p>
<p>But then, suppression would start to build.</p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p>And he was sent to exile.</p>
<p>He went to Najaf, which is this great center in southern.</p>
<p>So became a martyr on top of this.</p>
<p>That martyr, he was probably even forgotten to some extent.</p>
<p>But not, he was forgotten for the secular middle class.</p>
<p>But not to those supporters of his</p>
<p>who were paying him their dues.</p>
<p>Because in Islam, you would pay dues to religious leaders.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s religious dues and alms</p>
<p>that you would pay to the clerical authorities.</p>
<p>And they redistribute them</p>
<p>among their own students, and so forth.</p>
<p>So they built, actually, a network of loyalty</p>
<p>based on these donations.</p>
<p>And these donations that&rsquo;s received by Ayatollah Khomeini</p>
<p>was very effectively, through his network,</p>
<p>was distributed, even if he was in exile at Sa&rsquo;diran.</p>
<p>So, in 1977, 1978, when the situation changed,</p>
<p>and there was a little bit of opening</p>
<p>in the political climate,</p>
<p>then you saw that Ayatollah Khomeini</p>
<p>started sending cassette messages.</p>
<p>That was his mean of communication.</p>
<p>Was sending cassettes, and cassettes were sent</p>
<p>through the country by his network.</p>
<p>So, or declarations, and saying first</p>
<p>that we would like to see a greater democratization,</p>
<p>and the Shah has to abide by the constitution of 1907.</p>
<p>This is a constitution.</p>
<p>This is a democratic system, and so forth.</p>
<p>Was he charismatic?</p>
<p>Well, it depends who would call,</p>
<p>what you call charismatic.</p>
<p>He had a long beard.</p>
<p>He was kind of a man in turban and the gown,</p>
<p>which was a very unusual leadership</p>
<p>for people who were much more accustomed</p>
<p>to the civilian clothing, or to the equipments</p>
<p>of the Shah&rsquo;s military uniforms that he used to wear.</p>
<p>But I also mean, he is a man that was able to take power,</p>
<p>to become popular, sufficiently popular.</p>
<p>So, I would like, is it the ideas, is it an accident,</p>
<p>or is it the man himself, the charisma,</p>
<p>or something about the man that led</p>
<p>to this particular person basically changing the tide</p>
<p>of history in this part of the world,</p>
<p>in a way that was unexpected?</p>
<p>All the above that you mentioned.</p>
<p>Or was it just the beard?</p>
<p>No, I think, no, it&rsquo;s beyond the appearance.</p>
<p>The appearance greatly helps, as you know, you know.</p>
<p>In the 20th century, appearance is helpful, yeah.</p>
<p>Pictures for propaganda, for messaging.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an important factor.</p>
<p>And he was a kind of a adamant</p>
<p>and very severe</p>
<p>in his own positions.</p>
<p>He could appear very uncompromising.</p>
<p>And he had a sense of confidence, self-confidence,</p>
<p>that virtually everybody else lacked.</p>
<p>And he was a man of opportunity.</p>
<p>As soon as he would see that a chance,</p>
<p>an opportunity would open up, he would jump on it.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what he did, basically.</p>
<p>As more the political space opened,</p>
<p>the weaknesses of the Shah&rsquo;s government became more evident.</p>
<p>His indecision became more evident.</p>
<p>His lack of confidence became more evident.</p>
<p>Khomeini managed to move further</p>
<p>into the center of the movement</p>
<p>because he was the only authority</p>
<p>that had this network of support through the mosques,</p>
<p>through the people who paid homage to him,</p>
<p>who followed him, because there&rsquo;s a sense of following</p>
<p>of the religious leader in Shi&rsquo;ism.</p>
<p>You are a follower of this authority,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re a follower of that authority.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s basically created</p>
<p>an environment in which people looked upon him</p>
<p>as a kind of a messianic figure</p>
<p>that came to save Iran from what they considered</p>
<p>at the time the problems of dictatorship under the Shah.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s not a suspicion about Islamic law</p>
<p>being the primary law of the land?</p>
<p>Not at all.</p>
<p>People had very little sense</p>
<p>that what Islamic law is all about,</p>
<p>because the secular education has left that</p>
<p>into the old religious schools.</p>
<p>This is not something that ordinary educated Iranian</p>
<p>who goes to the universities is going to learn.</p>
<p>Therefore, there is a sense of idealization</p>
<p>that there is something great there that is good.</p>
<p>And there were quite a number of intellectuals</p>
<p>who also viewed this kind of an idea</p>
<p>of they would refer to as West&rsquo;s toxication,</p>
<p>that is this civilization of the West</p>
<p>that has brought with it all the modernity</p>
<p>that we see around ourselves,</p>
<p>has enormous sinister features into it.</p>
<p>And it has taken away from us our authenticity.</p>
<p>That was the thing, that there is something authentic</p>
<p>that should be protected.</p>
<p>And therefore, a man in that kind of a garb and appearance</p>
<p>seemed as a source for return to this originality</p>
<p>of their own culture, authenticity of their own culture.</p>
<p>And he perfectly took advantage of that, that is Khomeini,</p>
<p>took advantage of it and the circle around him</p>
<p>at the expense of everybody else,</p>
<p>which he managed in the course of 1979 to 1989,</p>
<p>which he died in the 10 years during this period,</p>
<p>managed to basically transform the Iranian society</p>
<p>to create institutions of the Islamic Republic</p>
<p>and to acquire himself the position</p>
<p>of the guardian jurist.</p>
<p>That was something completely new.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t ever exist before.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, as you might know,</p>
<p>the model of government that a religious establishment</p>
<p>takes over the states is unprecedented.</p>
<p>Throughout the course of Iranian history,</p>
<p>throughout the course of the Islamic history, I would say.</p>
<p>This is the first example and probably the only example</p>
<p>of a regime that the religious establishment</p>
<p>that has always, in the course of Iranian history,</p>
<p>ever since I would say probably at this 16th century,</p>
<p>if not earlier, has been always separate from the state</p>
<p>and always kind of collaborating with the state</p>
<p>with certain tensions in between the two of them.</p>
<p>There were two, basically as they would call themselves,</p>
<p>the two pillars of stability in the society.</p>
<p>That situation changed.</p>
<p>For the first time, the religious establishment</p>
<p>took over the power of the state.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s at the core of what we see today</p>
<p>as a major issue for Iranian society.</p>
<p>Because these are basically that old balance</p>
<p>between the religion and the state,</p>
<p>which was kind of a de facto separation</p>
<p>of the authorities of the two, has been violated.</p>
<p>And now you have in power a theocracy in effect,</p>
<p>which of course only in its appearance is theocracy.</p>
<p>Deep down, it&rsquo;s a, in my opinion,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a brutal fascist regime that stays in power.</p>
<p>But it has the appearance of religion into it.</p>
<p>So this is really the story of the revolution.</p>
<p>And as a result of that,</p>
<p>the Iranian middle class has greatly suffered.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not without a reason</p>
<p>that you see four million Iranians abroad.</p>
<p>Because basically the emergence of this new power</p>
<p>gradually isolated or marginalized</p>
<p>the secular middle class,</p>
<p>who could not survive under that regime.</p>
<p>And gradually moved out</p>
<p>in the course of perhaps 30, 40 years.</p>
<p>Up to now, Iran has the largest,</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;m right to say so,</p>
<p>has the largest brain drain in any country in the world,</p>
<p>proportion to its population.</p>
<p>So fascinating that,</p>
<p>how much of a weird quirk of history is it</p>
<p>that religion would take hold in a country?</p>
<p>Like, does it have to do with the individual?</p>
<p>It seems like if we re-ran the 20th century</p>
<p>a thousand times,</p>
<p>would we get the 79 revolution resulting in Islamic law</p>
<p>like less than 1% of the time, it feels like.</p>
<p>Or no, which percentage would you put on it?</p>
<p>Well, I think it has something to do</p>
<p>with the very complex nature</p>
<p>of how Iran evolved over a long period of time.</p>
<p>Since the 16th century.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why, if I would for a moment</p>
<p>talk about what I have written.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve written a book that&rsquo;s called Iran, A Modern History.</p>
<p>And it does not start in the 20th century.</p>
<p>It starts in the 16th century.</p>
<p>Because that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve argued,</p>
<p>that this complex process,</p>
<p>that at the end of the day resulted</p>
<p>in what we see around us today,</p>
<p>is something that was in making for a very long time.</p>
<p>Religion was a big part of it.</p>
<p>She and the messiah complex.</p>
<p>The longing for this great vision of a great nation</p>
<p>that somehow is the sublime nation</p>
<p>that can only be fully sublime through religion.</p>
<p>Or at the time it was thought that it&rsquo;s through religion.</p>
<p>Ever since then, it&rsquo;s disillusionment with that image.</p>
<p>Or at least a process of disillusionment.</p>
<p>The outcome of it is what we see today.</p>
<p>Basically, that process of 40 years</p>
<p>is a process of readjusting to the realities of the world.</p>
<p>That great moment of romantic success of a revolution,</p>
<p>like most revolutions, of course,</p>
<p>that is going to change Iran</p>
<p>and bring this kind of a moment of greatness,</p>
<p>led into this great disappointment.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a movement of the great disappointment in a sense.</p>
<p>Like most messianic movements, by the way.</p>
<p>Messianic movements in general</p>
<p>are always leading into great disappointments.</p>
<p>But what I have here that perhaps should be added to it,</p>
<p>that yes, it was a peculiarity of Iran as a society</p>
<p>that had to experience this eventual encounter</p>
<p>between religion and state.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s something to do with the nature of Shi&rsquo;ism.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just one point that should be pointed out.</p>
<p>Most of Sunni Islam don&rsquo;t have that kind of,</p>
<p>I say most because there is something there.</p>
<p>But Sunni Islam in general</p>
<p>does not have that kind of an aspiration</p>
<p>for the coming of a messianic leader.</p>
<p>Shi&rsquo;ism does.</p>
<p>Shi&rsquo;ism in its very shaping,</p>
<p>particularly the way that it was set up in Iran,</p>
<p>was a religion that has always this element</p>
<p>of expectation to it</p>
<p>for the coming of this messianic leader.</p>
<p>Of course, I mean, between parenthesis,</p>
<p>all societies look for messianic leaders.</p>
<p>I mean, just look around us.</p>
<p>But some societies more than others.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s certain culture,</p>
<p>it might have to do with the romantic poetry</p>
<p>that we mentioned earlier.</p>
<p>I mean, surely, I mean, not to draw too many parallels,</p>
<p>but with the Soviet Union, there was romanticism too.</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t know, it does, maybe idealism.</p>
<p>A sense of a savior.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Who would bring you out of the misery that you&rsquo;re in.</p>
<p>And always looking for a third party</p>
<p>to solve your issues.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why probably this movement</p>
<p>has a particular significance</p>
<p>because it probably doesn&rsquo;t look for a messiah.</p>
<p>Although, I was talking to my brother,</p>
<p>who is a historian also,</p>
<p>and he was saying perhaps the messiah of this movement</p>
<p>is that Mahsa Amini, the 22-year-old girl that was killed.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a martyred messiah who is now leading a movement</p>
<p>which no longer has that charismatic leadership</p>
<p>with it.</p>
<p>But yes, I would say that Iran has been the birthplace,</p>
<p>if I might say that, of messianic aspirations.</p>
<p>Going back to ancient Zoroastrianism,</p>
<p>which is really the whole system</p>
<p>that you see in major religions,</p>
<p>at least so-called Western religions,</p>
<p>so Abrahamic religions,</p>
<p>is parallel or perhaps influenced by Zoroastrianism</p>
<p>in which there is an idea of this world</p>
<p>and the other world, there is a hereafter.</p>
<p>There is an idea of a judgment at the end of the time.</p>
<p>And there is a concept that there is a moment of justice</p>
<p>that is going to come with the rise of a religious</p>
<p>or a charismatic figure.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a very old phenomenon in Iran, very old.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s time and again repeated itself</p>
<p>in the course of its history,</p>
<p>but never as powerfully as it happened in 1979,</p>
<p>and never in the form of authority</p>
<p>from within the religious establishment.</p>
<p>It was always the dissent movements</p>
<p>that were kind of antinomian.</p>
<p>They were against the authority</p>
<p>of the religious establishment.</p>
<p>That changed in the 20th century.</p>
<p>But the revolution in 1979,</p>
<p>that change is still with us today.</p>
<p>Can we just linger on,</p>
<p>are there some practical</p>
<p>games of power that occurred</p>
<p>in the way that Stalin took power</p>
<p>and held power in the early days?</p>
<p>Was there something like this</p>
<p>in terms of the establishment of the Revolutionary Guard</p>
<p>and all those kinds of stuff?</p>
<p>Yes, yes.</p>
<p>So the messianic figure has some support from the people,</p>
<p>but does he have to crush his enemies in competition?</p>
<p>It certainly did.</p>
<p>Probably not, certainly not as brutal</p>
<p>in terms of the victims</p>
<p>as you would see in Soviet Union under Stalin,</p>
<p>who the bloodshed</p>
<p>or the destruction of the population</p>
<p>was far greater than what you would find</p>
<p>in Iran of the Islamic Republic.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s uncomparable.</p>
<p>Perhaps I would find a greater parallel with Mao Zedong,</p>
<p>and particularly because China</p>
<p>has a very strong messianic tradition</p>
<p>since the ancient times.</p>
<p>So they have something,</p>
<p>and Mao appeared as a kind of a messianic figure.</p>
<p>There I can see there is a parallel,</p>
<p>but also you can see with any other authoritarian regime</p>
<p>with a messianic figure at the head of it</p>
<p>that it destroys all the other forces.</p>
<p>So during the course of the first 10 years</p>
<p>of the Islamic Revolution,</p>
<p>it destroyed the liberal nationalist secular,</p>
<p>it destroyed the guerrilla movements,</p>
<p>some of them Islamic, some of them Marxist,</p>
<p>who turned into political parties or tendencies</p>
<p>in the course of the post-revolution 1979.</p>
<p>They were completely destroyed</p>
<p>and in a very brutal fashion.</p>
<p>And their opposition,</p>
<p>even within the religious establishment,</p>
<p>because it wasn&rsquo;t a uniform,</p>
<p>there were many different tendencies,</p>
<p>those that were opposed to the authority of Ayatollah Khomeini</p>
<p>or now Imam Khomeini,</p>
<p>meaning almost a sacred religious figure</p>
<p>above the level of a religious authority.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a saint kind of a figure.</p>
<p>Since Shi&rsquo;ism has this idea of imams,</p>
<p>there were 11 of them, the 12th is hidden</p>
<p>and would come back at the end of the time.</p>
<p>This is a messianic figure.</p>
<p>So the title that was always used for them only in Shi&rsquo;ism,</p>
<p>never used for any other person.</p>
<p>He is the first person in the revolution of 1979,</p>
<p>first referred to as deputy of imam,</p>
<p>but the term deputy gradually disappeared</p>
<p>and he became Imam Khomeini.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s his official title.</p>
<p>I love human beings so much.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so beautiful.</p>
<p>These titles that we give each other,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s marvelous to observe.</p>
<p>You love it because you haven&rsquo;t been under that system.</p>
<p>No, I love it in a very dark human kind of way.</p>
<p>It caricatures itself.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost funny in its absurdity,</p>
<p>if not for the evil that it has led to in human history.</p>
<p>But also the fact that it&rsquo;s in fact fulfillment</p>
<p>in a kind of completely unintended fashion.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a fulfillment of that idea of a messiah</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;ve been fighting for.</p>
<p>This imam which is in a hidden for a thousand years</p>
<p>is here and not here.</p>
<p>Therefore, Khomeini would have, in a sense,</p>
<p>fulfilled those anticipations.</p>
<p>But beyond that, I&rsquo;ll just give you one example.</p>
<p>I know that you may have other concerns.</p>
<p>But when I say elimination,</p>
<p>at the end of the Iran-Iraq War,</p>
<p>by the direct order of Ayatollah Khomeini,</p>
<p>a fatwa that he wrote,</p>
<p>a group of prisoners</p>
<p>who belonged to a variety of political parties,</p>
<p>the left, religious left, majority of them,</p>
<p>the Marxist left and the religious left.</p>
<p>In a matter of a few weeks, or perhaps a few months,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not actually quite sure about the time span,</p>
<p>in a series of, these were people who have already been tried</p>
<p>and they were given sentences.</p>
<p>They were brought back before the summary trials</p>
<p>of three judges, or more, three, four of them.</p>
<p>One of them is now the new president</p>
<p>of the Islamic Republic, Raisi.</p>
<p>And they were given quick summary sentences</p>
<p>which meant execution.</p>
<p>So something between probably six to 8,000</p>
<p>were executed in a matter of a month or two months,</p>
<p>something like that.</p>
<p>Mostly in Tehran, but also in provinces.</p>
<p>And that remained an extraordinary trauma</p>
<p>for the families, for those who had these kids.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all young, all young.</p>
<p>So this remains very much a kind of original sin</p>
<p>of the Islamic Republic that cannot get rid of.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s in people&rsquo;s memories,</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t allow them, even the families,</p>
<p>to go and mourn their dead in an official cemetery</p>
<p>which they created for them.</p>
<p>Now the latest thing is that they put</p>
<p>a huge concrete wall around it</p>
<p>so nobody would be able to get into it.</p>
<p>So these all part of this extraordinary level</p>
<p>of level of atrocity, brutality,</p>
<p>that you see that the regime who claimed</p>
<p>that it comes with the morality of religion</p>
<p>and Islam to bring back the justice</p>
<p>and be more, in a sense, kind to people,</p>
<p>ended up with what it is in the memory</p>
<p>of many of the people in Iran.</p>
<p>So developing these fascistic tendencies.</p>
<p>Very much so.</p>
<p>Destroying minorities, Baha&rsquo;i is one of them.</p>
<p>Hundreds of Baha&rsquo;is were, without any reason,</p>
<p>without any involvement, were picked up</p>
<p>and executed.</p>
<p>Their properties were taken over.</p>
<p>Their rights were taken away from them,</p>
<p>even up to this day.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the largest, by the way, religious minority in Iran.</p>
<p>So you would see that in many areas</p>
<p>this acts very much as a beyond authoritarian.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of really a fascistic regime.</p>
<p>So Khamenei held power for 10 years</p>
<p>and then took power the next supreme leader</p>
<p>who is still the leader today for over 30 years.</p>
<p>Who is he?</p>
<p>Well, he was one of the, this is Ali Khamenei.</p>
<p>Ayatollah.</p>
<p>Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.</p>
<p>Imam one day, perhaps?</p>
<p>No, well, they hesitated to use the term Imam for him.</p>
<p>But in any other respect, he was given</p>
<p>all of that adulation that they did to Khamenei.</p>
<p>He is the guardian jurist.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s important.</p>
<p>Because the guardian jurist in the Constitution</p>
<p>of the Islamic Republic is an authority</p>
<p>that is above the state.</p>
<p>He is not elected, quote unquote,</p>
<p>because this is a divine authority.</p>
<p>Although he&rsquo;s been designated by the group</p>
<p>of determined mullahs like himself.</p>
<p>And he has the full power over all institutions</p>
<p>of the state, the army, the media, the economy.</p>
<p>Every aspect of, he acts like a shah.</p>
<p>He acts like this authoritarian authority.</p>
<p>Did that gradually develop, or was that very early on?</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s part of the Constitution</p>
<p>of the Islamic Republic.</p>
<p>The first Constitution, the first draft of the Constitution</p>
<p>did not have the authority of the guardian jurist.</p>
<p>But then it was added by Khamenei and his supporters.</p>
<p>Are there actually in the Constitution</p>
<p>any limits to his power?</p>
<p>Yes, there is a council of the experts, so to say,</p>
<p>that would remove him from power, I think theoretically.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s so much restrictions to that</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t think it would have ever happened in reality.</p>
<p>In his case, at least.</p>
<p>But in terms of executive, to make decisions</p>
<p>and all that kind of stuff,</p>
<p>does he need to check with anybody?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>He does check with his own advisors,</p>
<p>but he doesn&rsquo;t have any constitutional obligation</p>
<p>to check on the decisions that he&rsquo;s making.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the supreme leader, but there&rsquo;s been presidents.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s the role of the president?</p>
<p>The president, in a sense, is the executive power</p>
<p>under the Islamic Republic.</p>
<p>There are three heads of powers.</p>
<p>There is the president</p>
<p>that presumably has the executive power,</p>
<p>there is the head of the judiciary,</p>
<p>and there is the head of the speaker of the parliament,</p>
<p>majlis, Islamic majlis, which is the legislative.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s the legislative, judiciary, and executive.</p>
<p>Raisi, who is not a president, is the head of the executive.</p>
<p>Above them is the supreme leader,</p>
<p>or the guardian jurist.</p>
<p>Can you give me some insight?</p>
<p>Because I, especially, I&rsquo;m not exactly sure why,</p>
<p>but President Ahmadinejad is somebody</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m, as an American, really familiar with.</p>
<p>Why is that exactly?</p>
<p>But why was the president the public-facing person</p>
<p>to the world versus the supreme leader?</p>
<p>Is that just an accident of particular humans involved,</p>
<p>or is this by design?</p>
<p>No, because the supreme leader tries to keep himself</p>
<p>out of issues of everyday politics, supposedly.</p>
<p>But therefore, he is not coming to the United Nations</p>
<p>to give a speech during the session.</p>
<p>But Mr. Ahmadinejad, who at the time was the president,</p>
<p>would come and make outrageous statements.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why you probably know something about him.</p>
<p>So all of them make public statements,</p>
<p>but he had a proclivity for outrageous statements.</p>
<p>He does all kinds of things.</p>
<p>He makes all kinds of statements.</p>
<p>But he is somewhat above the everyday politics, in theory.</p>
<p>But of course, he&rsquo;s pulling all the strings,</p>
<p>without doubt, in every respect.</p>
<p>And it seems that you were asking,</p>
<p>I thought you were going to ask me this question,</p>
<p>almost without an exception,</p>
<p>since the inception of the Islamic Republic in 1979,</p>
<p>up to the last of the presidents of the Islamic Republic,</p>
<p>Rouhani, before the guy that is last year,</p>
<p>or a year and a half ago, was in a phony election,</p>
<p>got into the position of the president,</p>
<p>all of them, there&rsquo;s a long list,</p>
<p>all of them eventually fell out with the regime.</p>
<p>So there is no president,</p>
<p>except perhaps to some extent Rouhani,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;ll wait and see what&rsquo;s going to happen to him.</p>
<p>But prior to him, all of them,</p>
<p>including Ahmadinejad, fell out with the regime,</p>
<p>with the current regime in Iran.</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s Rouhani?</p>
<p>He was officially president for eight years.</p>
<p>Yeah, prior to Raisi.</p>
<p>Ibrahim Raisi, the 221,</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re saying is a phony election.</p>
<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s a phony election.</p>
<p>What happened?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s interesting?</p>
<p>Because the process of actually candidacy for presidency</p>
<p>is completely controlled by a council</p>
<p>that is under the control of the supreme leader.</p>
<p>So they have to approve who is going to be the candidate.</p>
<p>So not everybody can enter and say,</p>
<p>I would like to be a candidate.</p>
<p>So did Rouhani fall out of favor?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re saying there&rsquo;s some break?</p>
<p>Well, he is kind of out of favor now</p>
<p>because he was more moderate than this most recent regime.</p>
<p>But the point is that if you look,</p>
<p>this is something almost constitutional to the regime.</p>
<p>This is a regime that rejects all of the executive powers</p>
<p>because the division between the supreme authority</p>
<p>as a place of a supreme authority</p>
<p>versus the presidency has problematic.</p>
<p>It is as if there would be a supreme leader</p>
<p>in the United States above all the three sources of power.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s the kind of view</p>
<p>that you can see in today&rsquo;s Iran.</p>
<p>And of course, he&rsquo;s at the focus of all the criticism</p>
<p>that he receives from the demonstrators in today&rsquo;s Iran.</p>
<p>So on top of all this, recently</p>
<p>and throughout the last several years,</p>
<p>US and Iran are in the midst of nuclear deal negotiations.</p>
<p>This is another part of the story of Iran</p>
<p>is the development of nuclear weapons, the nuclear program.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re looking to restore the nuclear deal</p>
<p>known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, JCPOA.</p>
<p>What is the history, the present,</p>
<p>and the future of these negotiations over nuclear weapons?</p>
<p>What is interesting to you in this full context</p>
<p>from the 16th century of the messianic journey?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s interesting to you here?</p>
<p>You can argue that for a long time, even under the Shah,</p>
<p>but much more expressively and decisively</p>
<p>under the Islamic Republic,</p>
<p>there was a determination to have a nuclear power</p>
<p>or nuclear weapon, in a sense.</p>
<p>I think the bottom line of all the negotiations,</p>
<p>everything else, is that Iran of the Islamic Republic</p>
<p>had the tendency of having its own nuclear weapon.</p>
<p>The reason for that is that Iran was subject</p>
<p>of nearly nine years, eight and a half years</p>
<p>of Iran-Iraq war, when not only Iran faced an aggressor,</p>
<p>not only Iran faced an aggressor, Iraq,</p>
<p>that actually attacked Iran at a very critical time</p>
<p>at the very beginning of the Iranian Revolution,</p>
<p>but the fact that Iran felt kind of helpless</p>
<p>in the course of this war</p>
<p>and has to make great sacrifices, actually,</p>
<p>which supported the Islamic regime</p>
<p>and consolidated the Islamic regime</p>
<p>because of this war.</p>
<p>And most of the time,</p>
<p>their support of the United States</p>
<p>was behind Iraq vis-a-vis Iran.</p>
<p>And Iran felt that it&rsquo;s been isolated</p>
<p>and has to protect itself.</p>
<p>So there is some argument</p>
<p>for having a nuclear capabilities.</p>
<p>But in reality, this has resulted</p>
<p>in a completely mindless, crazy,</p>
<p>wasteful attempt on the side of the Iranian regime</p>
<p>to try to develop a nuclear power.</p>
<p>And therefore, the rest of the world,</p>
<p>particularly in this region, were very worried</p>
<p>that if Iran would get access to a nuclear weapon,</p>
<p>then the entire region of the Persian Gulf</p>
<p>might, particularly Saudi Arabia, possibly Turkey,</p>
<p>possibly Egypt, all of them may require,</p>
<p>may demand to have also nuclear weapon,</p>
<p>given the fact that Pakistan and India has already have it.</p>
<p>So there was a determined attempt, as you might know,</p>
<p>on the side of the Western communities</p>
<p>or now gradually world communities</p>
<p>to try to, as much as possible,</p>
<p>to control Iran from getting access</p>
<p>to a nuclear capability,</p>
<p>or actually limit Iran&rsquo;s nuclear capabilities</p>
<p>to what was defined usually in a euphemism</p>
<p>as a peaceful fashion, okay?</p>
<p>That being said, there was also Israel,</p>
<p>which viewed the Islamic Republic as a arch enemy.</p>
<p>And some of it might be due to the Israelis&rsquo; own exaggeration</p>
<p>of Iran&rsquo;s threat, and some of it is because Iran</p>
<p>has developed a fairly strong military, as we see today.</p>
<p>And as such, this attempt to try to prevent Iran</p>
<p>from ever getting access to a nuclear weapon,</p>
<p>which resulted, as you might know,</p>
<p>in these massive sanctions that were imposed upon Iran</p>
<p>ever since the beginning of the revolution in 1979,</p>
<p>and, of course, more intensively since 2015, 2016,</p>
<p>even prior to that, probably a little bit earlier.</p>
<p>This agreement, the nuclear agreement,</p>
<p>was supposed to control or monitor</p>
<p>Iranian nuclear industry or nuclear setup</p>
<p>in exchange for removing the sanctions.</p>
<p>But this never worked, as a matter of fact,</p>
<p>in a very successful, satisfactory way</p>
<p>for the Iranians or for the Americans,</p>
<p>particularly under Trump administration,</p>
<p>which I think foolishly decided to scrap the agreement</p>
<p>that was reached under President Obama.</p>
<p>Like many other policies that was implemented</p>
<p>under Trump administration, this created a major problem.</p>
<p>That is how to, under Biden, how to try to come up</p>
<p>with a new nuclear agreement with Iran.</p>
<p>In this process, since 2016,</p>
<p>where the United States withdrew from the agreement,</p>
<p>Iran felt comfortable to try to go</p>
<p>and do whatever they want without any kind of monitor,</p>
<p>being monitored by the international community.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the situation now.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know whether Iran is really sincere</p>
<p>under the present regime to negotiate a deal.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know that the United States is willing to do so.</p>
<p>And it seems that now what is happening</p>
<p>in terms of the protests in the Iranian streets</p>
<p>makes it even harder in public eye</p>
<p>to try to negotiate a deal with Iran.</p>
<p>Because that means, in the minds of many,</p>
<p>and with some justification,</p>
<p>that if the nuclear agreement would result</p>
<p>in the removal of many of these sanctions,</p>
<p>millions, billions, as the result of the removal</p>
<p>of the sanctions and Iran&rsquo;s ability to sell its oil</p>
<p>in the international market without any restrictions,</p>
<p>means that the Iranian government</p>
<p>is going to become even more powerful,</p>
<p>more financially secure in order to suppress its own people.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the agreement that goes against</p>
<p>coming to terms with Iran.</p>
<p>But the problem is that there is no clear alternative,</p>
<p>even I&rsquo;m not particularly personally favorable</p>
<p>for this agreement to be ratified.</p>
<p>But the alternative is very difficult.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no way to try to see what can be done.</p>
<p>Geopolitics where every alternative is terrible.</p>
<p>Let me ask you about one of the most complex</p>
<p>geopolitical situations in history.</p>
<p>One aspect of it is the Cold War between Iran and Israel.</p>
<p>The bigger picture of it is sometimes referred to</p>
<p>as Israel-Palestine conflict.</p>
<p>What are all the parties, nations involved?</p>
<p>What are the interests that are involved?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the rhetoric?</p>
<p>Can you understand, make the case</p>
<p>for each side of this conflict?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re opening a new can of worms</p>
<p>that it takes another three hours of conversation.</p>
<p>Just three hours?</p>
<p>At least.</p>
<p>What I can tell you is this.</p>
<p>Iran, prior to 1979, viewed itself under the Shah</p>
<p>as a kind of a, if not supporter of Israel,</p>
<p>was in very good terms with Israel.</p>
<p>They had an embassy in Iran, or unofficial embassy in Iran.</p>
<p>They had certain projects that&rsquo;s helping</p>
<p>with the agriculture and so forth in Iran.</p>
<p>But since 1979, that completely reversed.</p>
<p>Part of it is that the issue of the Palestinian plight</p>
<p>remained very much at the heart</p>
<p>of the revolutionary Iranians who would see</p>
<p>that part of the United States is to support,</p>
<p>part of the United States&rsquo; guilt, sin,</p>
<p>is to support Israel vis-a-vis its very suppressive,</p>
<p>very oppressive treatment of the Palestinians,</p>
<p>completely illegal taking over of the territories</p>
<p>which is not theirs since 1967.</p>
<p>And therefore, it is upon the Iranian regime,</p>
<p>Iranian Islamic Republic, to support</p>
<p>the cause of the Palestinians.</p>
<p>This came about at a time when the rest</p>
<p>of the support for the Palestinians,</p>
<p>including Arab nationalism, basically reached</p>
<p>the stage of bankruptcy.</p>
<p>I mean, much of the regimes of the Arab world</p>
<p>either are now coming to terms with Israel,</p>
<p>or in one way or another, because of their own contingencies,</p>
<p>because of their own concerns and interests,</p>
<p>are willy-nilly accepting Israel in the region.</p>
<p>Now, that old task of rhetorically supporting</p>
<p>the Palestinians falls upon the Islamic Republic</p>
<p>that sees itself as a champion of the Palestinians now.</p>
<p>Without, as a matter of fact, having either the support</p>
<p>of the Iranian people behind him, if you ask,</p>
<p>if tomorrow there would be a poll or a referendum,</p>
<p>I would doubt that 80% of the Iranian people</p>
<p>would approve of the policies of the Islamic Republic</p>
<p>vis-a-vis the issue of Palestine.</p>
<p>Nor the Palestinians themselves,</p>
<p>because the Islamic Republic&rsquo;s only supporting</p>
<p>those factions within the Palestinian movement</p>
<p>which are Islamic, quote-unquote.</p>
<p>And even within that, there is problems</p>
<p>with Hamas, for instance.</p>
<p>But nevertheless, it&rsquo;s for the Islamic Republic</p>
<p>some kind of a propaganda tool to be able to use it</p>
<p>for its own sake, and claim that we are the champions</p>
<p>of the Palestinian people.</p>
<p>Whether they have a solution, if you look at their rhetoric,</p>
<p>if you listen to their rhetoric,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the destruction of the state of Israel.</p>
<p>And that, it seems to me, creates a certain anxiety</p>
<p>in the minds of the Israelis, Israeli population,</p>
<p>and Israeli government.</p>
<p>Particularly those who are now in power.</p>
<p>Netanyahu, the Likud, and more kind of a right-wing politics</p>
<p>of, polity of today&rsquo;s Israel.</p>
<p>That being said, I think also the Israelis</p>
<p>try to get an extra mileage out of</p>
<p>a threat of Iran, quote-unquote.</p>
<p>In order to present themselves</p>
<p>as a rightful to, for terms of security and whatever else.</p>
<p>The way that they&rsquo;re treating the Palestinians,</p>
<p>which I think is extremely unjust.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s extremely unwise for Israel</p>
<p>to carry on with these policies, as they did since 1967,</p>
<p>at least, and not to try to come to terms with it.</p>
<p>Of course, there are huge amount of,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not denying that at all,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a huge amount of failures, mistakes,</p>
<p>and stupidity on the side of the Palestinian leadership</p>
<p>in various stages.</p>
<p>Not to try to make a deal,</p>
<p>or try to come to terms in some fashion.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s a very complex picture,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s rather unfair to the Palestinians</p>
<p>to accuse them for not coming to terms with Israel</p>
<p>under a very uneven circumstances.</p>
<p>When they are not in a position to try to make a fair deal,</p>
<p>in terms of the territories,</p>
<p>or in terms of their security in future vis-a-vis Israel.</p>
<p>So I think there&rsquo;s, as you probably know,</p>
<p>quite a lot of people that would have</p>
<p>a different perspective than you just stated,</p>
<p>in terms of taking the perspective of Israel</p>
<p>and characterizing the situation.</p>
<p>Can you steelman their side?</p>
<p>Can you steelman Israel&rsquo;s side,</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re trying to be a sovereign nation,</p>
<p>trying to protect themselves against threats,</p>
<p>ultimately wanting to create a place of safety,</p>
<p>a place where people can pursue all the things</p>
<p>that you want to pursue in life,</p>
<p>including foremost, happiness?</p>
<p>I tend to agree with you,</p>
<p>and I have all the respect for the fact that</p>
<p>Israel would like to create security</p>
<p>and happiness for its own people.</p>
<p>But there are two arguments.</p>
<p>One is a moral argument.</p>
<p>To my mind as a historian,</p>
<p>Jews across, around the world,</p>
<p>for all through their history, suffered.</p>
<p>And this is a history of suffering.</p>
<p>This is a memory of suffering.</p>
<p>And I find it enormously difficult to believe</p>
<p>that a nation that&rsquo;s the product of so much</p>
<p>sacrifice, suffering, loss of life,</p>
<p>and variety of Holocaust above all,</p>
<p>would find itself in a position</p>
<p>not to give the proper justice</p>
<p>to a people who could be their neighbors.</p>
<p>And that is a moral argument which I cannot believe</p>
<p>under any circumstances can be accepted.</p>
<p>Second, in real terms,</p>
<p>what do you want to, you want to commit a genocide?</p>
<p>Do you have a population there</p>
<p>that you have to come to terms with it?</p>
<p>And you cannot just postpone as they did.</p>
<p>Since 67 they are postponing</p>
<p>and hoping that it goes away somehow.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s going to go away.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s going to get worse rather than better.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a long nuanced discussion</p>
<p>and I look forward to having it.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ll just leave it</p>
<p>there for the moment.</p>
<p>But it is</p>
<p>a stressful place in the world</p>
<p>where the rhetoric is existential,</p>
<p>where Iran makes claims</p>
<p>that it wants to wipe a country off the face of the earth.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just the level of intensity of rhetoric</p>
<p>is unlike anywhere else in the world.</p>
<p>And extremely dangerous.</p>
<p>And in both directions.</p>
<p>So one, the real danger of the rhetoric</p>
<p>actually being acted upon</p>
<p>and then the extreme political parties</p>
<p>using the rhetoric to justify</p>
<p>even a greater escalation.</p>
<p>So if Iran is saying that this is</p>
<p>saying that they want to wipe Israel</p>
<p>off the face of the earth,</p>
<p>that justifies any response.</p>
<p>On the other side.</p>
<p>On the other side.</p>
<p>Of course, I tend to agree with you fully.</p>
<p>And unfortunately, this is a very critical situation</p>
<p>that this region is facing, Iran in particular.</p>
<p>I would say that</p>
<p>I hope that in the minds of the people of Israel,</p>
<p>there is enough or common sense</p>
<p>to realize that probably escalation on the Israeli side</p>
<p>is not in the favor of anybody.</p>
<p>And try to let the Iranians to go on</p>
<p>with their empty rhetoric as they do so far.</p>
<p>But at the same time,</p>
<p>I cannot deny the fact that, you know,</p>
<p>there is a danger on the side of this regime</p>
<p>and what it says.</p>
<p>It cannot be denied.</p>
<p>Nobody can justify that.</p>
<p>Particularly because the Iranian population</p>
<p>is not behind this regime.</p>
<p>Certainly in the case of the Palestinians.</p>
<p>Or for that matter, it&rsquo;s not Palestine.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the Islamic Republic&rsquo;s involvement</p>
<p>in Lebanon with Hezbollah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the Islamic Republic&rsquo;s involvement</p>
<p>in Syria with Bashar Assad.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s involvement in other parts of the world,</p>
<p>perhaps even Yemen.</p>
<p>That all of them creates extraterritorial</p>
<p>responsibilities or interventions,</p>
<p>unnecessary interventions that ultimately</p>
<p>is not in favor of best interest of the Iranian people</p>
<p>or Iran as a country.</p>
<p>Iran has never been involved in this kind of politics</p>
<p>before of the Islamic Republic.</p>
<p>So in a sense, the Iranian regime,</p>
<p>it seems to me, by going to the extreme,</p>
<p>try to create for itself a space</p>
<p>that it did not have or did not deserve to have</p>
<p>within the politics of the region.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a, in other words, that has become part</p>
<p>of the tool, kind of an instrument for,</p>
<p>if you like to call it, some kind of an expansionism</p>
<p>of the regime.</p>
<p>In parts of the world where it can see</p>
<p>there is a possibility for its presence,</p>
<p>for its expansion.</p>
<p>Of course, historically speaking,</p>
<p>Iran, ever since 15th century,</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s the earliest example I can see,</p>
<p>in early modern times, has always a tendency</p>
<p>of moving in the direction of not only what is today</p>
<p>the state of Iraq, but further into the eastern coast</p>
<p>of Mediterranean.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a long-term ambition that has been in the cards</p>
<p>as far as Iran as a strategic unit is concerned.</p>
<p>But by no means justified, and by no means could be</p>
<p>a reasonable, could be a sane policy of a nation, state,</p>
<p>as today&rsquo;s Iran.</p>
<p>But the second point is that also,</p>
<p>regimes are always victims of their own rhetoric.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s, once you keep repeating something,</p>
<p>then you become more and more committed to it.</p>
<p>And it cannot remain anymore in the level of a rhetoric.</p>
<p>You have to do something about it.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a compelling pressure to try to materialize</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;ve been saying in your rhetoric.</p>
<p>And that is even extremely more dangerous,</p>
<p>as far as Iran is concerned.</p>
<p>And it brings it to some unholy alliances</p>
<p>that today we are witnessing Iran is getting involved.</p>
<p>Even more dangerous than this rhetoric</p>
<p>in terms of the, vis-a-vis Israel,</p>
<p>is its involvement with Russia,</p>
<p>and to some extent with China, which we can talk about.</p>
<p>What do you think about the meeting</p>
<p>between Khamenei and Vladimir Putin in July?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s that alliance?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s that partnership?</p>
<p>Is it surface-level geopolitics,</p>
<p>or is there a deep, growing connection?</p>
<p>I cannot see the difference between geopolitics</p>
<p>and these deep connections.</p>
<p>I see this one and the same.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because I think the experience of 40 years</p>
<p>of distancing from the West,</p>
<p>in terms of the Islamic Republic,</p>
<p>and the fact that there is a shelf life</p>
<p>to imperial presence for any empire anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>So after the terrible experience of the United States</p>
<p>in Iraq and in Afghanistan,</p>
<p>pretty much like the British Empire,</p>
<p>that after the Suez experience in 56,</p>
<p>decided to withdraw from east of Suez,</p>
<p>maybe there is a moment here that we are witnessing,</p>
<p>or it may come, that a great power</p>
<p>like the United States sees in its benefit</p>
<p>not to get too much involved into nitty-gritty things</p>
<p>in other parts of the world,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s not its immediate concern.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>And I think that is part of the reason,</p>
<p>not the entire reason,</p>
<p>part of the reason why we see the emergence</p>
<p>of a new geopolitical environment</p>
<p>in this part of the world,</p>
<p>of which China, Russia, possibly Iran,</p>
<p>possibly Turkey, possibly both of them,</p>
<p>are going to be part.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>Perhaps Saudis also,</p>
<p>but I doubt that the Saudis,</p>
<p>under the present circumstances,</p>
<p>although we&rsquo;ve witnessed some remarkable issue</p>
<p>in the course of the past few weeks,</p>
<p>where the Saudis giving assurances</p>
<p>to American administration,</p>
<p>and then shifting and getting along with Putin,</p>
<p>in terms of the oil production,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s more than that, even.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not only them,</p>
<p>but also the Emirates are doing the same thing.</p>
<p>So what does that tell us?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s another many-hour conversation</p>
<p>about the oil industry in Iran and the whole region.</p>
<p>In emerging this kind of a world,</p>
<p>which was perhaps even 10 years ago unimaginable,</p>
<p>that you see now a great power, China,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s going to remain,</p>
<p>from what we see around us, as a great power.</p>
<p>And Russia, adventurous, foolish,</p>
<p>but nevertheless would remain criminal,</p>
<p>I would say, as far as its behavior in Ukraine.</p>
<p>But actually, it&rsquo;s a rogue nation</p>
<p>that attracts another rogue nation.</p>
<p>So Iran finds itself now in a greater place of security</p>
<p>in alliance with Russia,</p>
<p>in the hope that this would give Iran</p>
<p>a greater security in this part of the world.</p>
<p>Whether this is realistic or an illusion,</p>
<p>I think remains to be seen.</p>
<p>I think Iran-China relation makes more sense.</p>
<p>Although, if you ask ordinary Iranians,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t like it.</p>
<p>They would tell, why should we be tied up</p>
<p>with China as the only trade party with America</p>
<p>because of the foolish isolations</p>
<p>that you have created for us,</p>
<p>because of all the sanctions that you have created for us,</p>
<p>the Islamic Republic.</p>
<p>So in a sense, it&rsquo;s a very difficult question to answer.</p>
<p>Probably Iranians also like to be more on the other camp.</p>
<p>But what happens is that in real term,</p>
<p>what surprises me most is not this alliance with China,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s kind of becoming a lackey or subservient</p>
<p>to Putin&rsquo;s regime in Russia.</p>
<p>Since if you look at it,</p>
<p>Iran ever since at least the 19th century,</p>
<p>not going further back,</p>
<p>the beginning of the 19th century,</p>
<p>always viewed Russia as the greatest threat strategically</p>
<p>because it was sitting right at the top of Iran.</p>
<p>It was infinitely more powerful than Iran has ever been.</p>
<p>And Iran fought two rounds of war</p>
<p>at the beginning of the century,</p>
<p>lost the entire Caucasus to Russia and learned its lesson</p>
<p>that you have to be mindful of Russia</p>
<p>and you have to keep it as an arm&rsquo;s length.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what was Iran&rsquo;s policy</p>
<p>throughout the course of the 20th century,</p>
<p>19th and 20th century,</p>
<p>up to what we see now around us,</p>
<p>which is a very strange situation.</p>
<p>Whether the balance has changed in terms of</p>
<p>if Russia is purchasing weapons from Iran,</p>
<p>which was unheard of,</p>
<p>it means that there is a new balance is emerging,</p>
<p>a new relationship is emerging.</p>
<p>Perhaps remains to be seen.</p>
<p>But if you look at the historical precedence,</p>
<p>it would have been enormously unwise</p>
<p>to be an ally of Russia,</p>
<p>given its long history of aggression in Iran.</p>
<p>See, Russians, part of the reason</p>
<p>why it&rsquo;s actually Iran allied itself with British Empire</p>
<p>was the fact that it was so much afraid</p>
<p>of the Russian expansion.</p>
<p>And as such, I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s going to be the future</p>
<p>of this relationship.</p>
<p>There is a big disconnect</p>
<p>between governments and the people.</p>
<p>And I think ultimately, I have faith</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a love across the different cultures,</p>
<p>across the different religions amongst the people.</p>
<p>And the governments are the source of the division</p>
<p>and the conflict and the wars and all the geopolitics</p>
<p>that is in part grounded in the battle for resources</p>
<p>and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, this is the world we live in.</p>
<p>So you looked at the modern history of Iran</p>
<p>the past few centuries.</p>
<p>If you look into the future of this region,</p>
<p>now you kind of implied that historian</p>
<p>has a bit of a cynical view</p>
<p>of protests and things like this</p>
<p>that are fueled, at least in the minds of young people,</p>
<p>with hope.</p>
<p>If you were to, just for a while,</p>
<p>have a bit of hope in your heart and your mind,</p>
<p>what is a hopeful future for the next 10, 20, 30 years</p>
<p>of Iran?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not cynical.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I try to be realistic.</p>
<p>And I actually may be critical,</p>
<p>but I have great hopes in Iran&rsquo;s future</p>
<p>for a variety of reasons.</p>
<p>I actually did write an article,</p>
<p>only the last version of it is going to go out today,</p>
<p>in which the title of it is</p>
<p>The Time of Fear and Women of Hope,</p>
<p>which in a sense is this whole coverage</p>
<p>about what this movement means that we see today.</p>
<p>It may fizzle in a few weeks&rsquo; time,</p>
<p>or it may just go on and create new dynamics</p>
<p>in Iranian society that would hopefully result</p>
<p>in a peaceful process of greater accommodation</p>
<p>and a greater tolerance within the Iranian society</p>
<p>and with the outside world.</p>
<p>And I think majority of the Iranian people</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t want tension.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t want confrontation.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t want crisis.</p>
<p>They, if 40 years they have suffered</p>
<p>from a regime that have dictated an ideology</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s regressive and impractical,</p>
<p>they want to go back to a life</p>
<p>in which they don&rsquo;t really create trouble</p>
<p>for their neighbors or for the world.</p>
<p>And therefore, I would see a better future for Iran.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s for one reason.</p>
<p>Strategically or geopolitically,</p>
<p>maybe in Iran&rsquo;s advantage in a peaceful fashion</p>
<p>to negotiate as it&rsquo;s the fate of all the nations,</p>
<p>rather than commit itself or sworn</p>
<p>to a particular course of policy.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a give and take,</p>
<p>as the nature of politics is art of possible,</p>
<p>as it&rsquo;s been said.</p>
<p>So probably Iran is going to be hopefully</p>
<p>moving in that direction.</p>
<p>I think there is a generational thing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the third reason.</p>
<p>No matter how much the Islamic Republic</p>
<p>tried to Islamicize the Iranian society</p>
<p>in its own image of kind of radical,</p>
<p>ideological indoctrination, it has failed.</p>
<p>It has failed up to what we see today</p>
<p>in the Iranian streets.</p>
<p>And the Iranian population said no to it.</p>
<p>And I think if there would have been,</p>
<p>and I very much hope there will be,</p>
<p>a possibility for a more open environment,</p>
<p>more open space where they would be able</p>
<p>to speak their views out,</p>
<p>Iranians are not on the side of moving</p>
<p>in the extreme directions.</p>
<p>They are in the side of greater accommodation</p>
<p>and the greater interest in the outside world.</p>
<p>And if you look at every aspect of today&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>beside the government, every aspect of life</p>
<p>in today&rsquo;s Iran, you can see that.</p>
<p>From the way that people dress,</p>
<p>to the way that they try to live their lives,</p>
<p>to the way that they&rsquo;re educating themselves</p>
<p>or being educated in the institutions,</p>
<p>do you see a desire, an intention to move forward?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m optimistic.</p>
<p>Well, in that struggle for freedom,</p>
<p>like I told you offline,</p>
<p>one of my close childhood friends is Iranian.</p>
<p>Just a beautiful person, his family is a wonderful family.</p>
<p>On a personal level, is one of the deeper windows</p>
<p>into the Iranian spirit and soul</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve gotten a chance to witness,</p>
<p>so I really appreciate it.</p>
<p>But in the recent times, I&rsquo;ve gotten to hear</p>
<p>from a lot of people that are currently living in Iran,</p>
<p>that are currently have that burning hope</p>
<p>for the future of the country.</p>
<p>And so, my love goes out to them</p>
<p>in the struggle for freedom.</p>
<p>I have to say.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s so nice of you to say so.</p>
<p>And I very much hope so.</p>
<p>There are moments of despair,</p>
<p>and there are moments that you would think</p>
<p>that there is no hope.</p>
<p>But then again, something triggers,</p>
<p>and you see 100,000 people in the streets of Berlin</p>
<p>that are hoping for a better future for Iran.</p>
<p>And I very much hope it eventually emerges,</p>
<p>even I&rsquo;m hoping at the same time</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s not going to be a very strong leadership,</p>
<p>as it was the case in the past.</p>
<p>We started with hope, we ended with hope.</p>
<p>This was a real honor.</p>
<p>This is an incredible conversation.</p>
<p>Thank you for giving such a deep</p>
<p>and wide story of this great nation,</p>
<p>one of the great nations in history.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s very kind of you to say so.</p>
<p>And thank you for sitting down today.</p>
<p>This was amazing.</p>
<p>Well, a history that&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>as I&rsquo;ve said in the start of my book,</p>
<p>I say it&rsquo;s the history of a nation</p>
<p>which has learned a huge amount from the outside world</p>
<p>by force of its geography.</p>
<p>It was always located somewhere that people would invade</p>
<p>or come for trade or something happened to it</p>
<p>that this diffused culture continued to,</p>
<p>and they were not afraid of learning or adopting,</p>
<p>as they do right now today.</p>
<p>This is a very different society.</p>
<p>Never a boring moment in its history, as you write about.</p>
<p>Thank you so much.</p>
<p>This was awesome.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation with Abba Samana.</p>

<p>from Martin Luther King, Jr.</p>
<p>From every mountainside, let freedom ring.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening.</p>
<p>I hope to see you next time.</p>
