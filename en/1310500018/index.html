    <p>The following is a conversation with Elon Musk.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the CEO of Tesla, SpaceX, Neuralink, and a cofounder of several other companies.</p>
<p>This conversation is part of the Artificial Intelligence podcast.</p>
<p>The series includes leading researchers in academia and industry, including CEOs</p>
<p>and CTOs of automotive, robotics, AI, and technology companies.</p>
<p>This conversation happened after the release of the paper from our group at MIT</p>
<p>on Driver Functional Vigilance, during use of Tesla&rsquo;s Autopilot.</p>
<p>The Tesla team reached out to me offering a podcast conversation with Mr.</p>
<p>Musk.</p>
<p>I accepted, with full control of questions I could ask and the choice</p>
<p>of what is released publicly.</p>
<p>I ended up editing out nothing of substance.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never spoken with Elon before this conversation, publicly or privately.</p>
<p>Neither he nor his companies have any influence on my opinion, nor on the rigor</p>
<p>and integrity of the scientific method that I practice in my position at MIT.</p>
<p>Tesla has never financially supported my research, and I&rsquo;ve never owned a Tesla</p>
<p>vehicle, and I&rsquo;ve never owned Tesla stock.</p>
<p>This podcast is not a scientific paper.</p>
<p>It is a conversation.</p>
<p>I respect Elon as I do all other leaders and engineers I&rsquo;ve spoken with.</p>
<p>We agree on some things and disagree on others.</p>
<p>My goal is always with these conversations is to understand the way</p>
<p>the guest sees the world.</p>
<p>One particular point of disagreement in this conversation was the extent to</p>
<p>which camera based driver monitoring will improve outcomes and for how long</p>
<p>it will remain relevant for AI assisted driving.</p>
<p>As someone who works on and is fascinated by human centered artificial</p>
<p>intelligence, I believe that if implemented and integrated effectively,</p>
<p>camera based driver monitoring is likely to be of benefit in both the short</p>
<p>term and the long term.</p>
<p>In contrast, Elon and Tesla&rsquo;s focus is on the improvement of autopilot such</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s statistical safety benefits override any concern of human behavior</p>
<p>and psychology.</p>
<p>Elon and I may not agree on everything, but I deeply respect the engineering</p>
<p>and innovation behind the efforts that he leads.</p>
<p>My goal here is to catalyze a rigorous nuanced and objective discussion in</p>
<p>industry and academia on AI assisted driving.</p>
<p>One that ultimately makes for a safer and better world.</p>
<p>And now here&rsquo;s my conversation with Elon Musk.</p>
<p>What was the vision, the dream of autopilot when, in the beginning, the</p>
<p>big picture system level, when it was first conceived and started being</p>
<p>installed in 2014, the hardware and the cars, what was the vision, the dream?</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t characterize the vision or dream, simply that there are obviously</p>
<p>two massive revolutions in, in the automobile industry.</p>
<p>One is the transition to electrification and then the other is autonomy.</p>
<p>And it became obvious to me that in the future, any car that does not have</p>
<p>autonomy would be about as useful as a horse, which is not to say that</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no use, it&rsquo;s just rare and somewhat idiosyncratic if somebody</p>
<p>has a horse at this point.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just obvious that cars will drive themselves completely.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a question of time.</p>
<p>And if we did not participate in the autonomy revolution, then our cars</p>
<p>would not be useful to people relative to cars that are autonomous.</p>
<p>I mean, an autonomous car is arguably worth five to 10 times more than</p>
<p>a car which is not autonomous.</p>
<p>In the long term.</p>
<p>Turns out what you mean by long term, but let&rsquo;s say at least for the</p>
<p>next five years, perhaps 10 years.</p>
<p>So there are a lot of very interesting design choices with autopilot early on.</p>
<p>First is showing on the instrument cluster or in the Model 3 on the</p>
<p>center stack display, what the combined sensor suite sees, what was the</p>
<p>thinking behind that choice?</p>
<p>Was there a debate?</p>
<p>What was the process?</p>
<p>The whole point of the display is to provide a health check on the</p>
<p>vehicle&rsquo;s perception of reality.</p>
<p>So the vehicle&rsquo;s taking information from a bunch of sensors, primarily</p>
<p>cameras, but also radar and ultrasonics, GPS, and so forth.</p>
<p>And then that, that information is then rendered into vector space and that,</p>
<p>you know, with a bunch of objects with, with properties like lane lines and</p>
<p>traffic lights and other cars.</p>
<p>And then in vector space that is rerendered onto a display.</p>
<p>So you can confirm whether the car knows what&rsquo;s going on or not</p>
<p>by looking out the window.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s an extremely powerful thing for people to get an understanding.</p>
<p>So it become one with the system and understanding what</p>
<p>the system is capable of.</p>
<p>Now, have you considered showing more?</p>
<p>So if we look at the computer vision, you know, like road segmentation,</p>
<p>lane detection, vehicle detection, object detection, underlying the system,</p>
<p>there is at the edges, some uncertainty.</p>
<p>Have you considered revealing the parts that the vehicle is</p>
<p>in, the parts that the, the uncertainty in the system, the sort of probabilities</p>
<p>associated with, with say image recognition or something like that?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So right now it shows like the vehicles in the vicinity, a very clean, crisp image.</p>
<p>And people do confirm that there&rsquo;s a car in front of me and the system</p>
<p>sees there&rsquo;s a car in front of me, but to help people build an intuition</p>
<p>of what computer vision is by showing some of the uncertainty.</p>
<p>Well, I think it&rsquo;s, in my car, I always look at the sort of the debug view.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s two debug views.</p>
<p>Uh, one is augmented vision, uh, where, which I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve seen where it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>basically, we draw boxes and labels around objects that are recognized.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s a work called the visualizer, which is basically vector</p>
<p>space representation, summing up the input from all sensors that doesn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t, does not show any pictures, but it shows, uh, all of the, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>basically shows the car&rsquo;s view of, of, of the world in vector space.</p>
<p>Um, but I think this is very difficult for people to know, normal people to</p>
<p>understand, they would not know what they&rsquo;re looking at.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s almost an HMI challenge to the current things that are being</p>
<p>displayed is optimized for the general public understanding of</p>
<p>what the system is capable of.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, if you have no idea what, how computer vision works or anything,</p>
<p>you can sort of look at the screen and see if the car knows what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>And then if you&rsquo;re, you know, if you&rsquo;re a development engineer or if you&rsquo;re,</p>
<p>you know, if you&rsquo;re, if you have the development build like I do, then you</p>
<p>can see, uh, you know, all the debug information, but those would just be</p>
<p>like total diverse to most people.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your view on how to best distribute effort.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s three, I would say technical aspects of autopilot</p>
<p>that are really important.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s the underlying algorithms, like the neural network architecture,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s the data, so that the strain on, and then there&rsquo;s a hardware development.</p>
<p>There may be others, but so look, algorithm, data, hardware, you don&rsquo;t, you</p>
<p>only have so much money, only have so much time, what do you think is the most</p>
<p>important thing to, to, uh, allocate resources to, or do you see it as pretty</p>
<p>evenly distributed between those three?</p>
<p>We automatically get a fast amounts of data because all of our cars have eight</p>
<p>external facing cameras and radar, and usually 12 ultrasonic sensors, uh, GPS,</p>
<p>obviously, um, and, uh, IMU.</p>
<p>And so we basically have a fleet that has, uh, and we&rsquo;ve got about 400,000</p>
<p>cars on the road that have that level of data, I think you keep quite</p>
<p>close track of it actually.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re, we&rsquo;re approaching half a million cars on the road that have the full sensor</p>
<p>suite.</p>
<p>Um, so this is, I&rsquo;m, I&rsquo;m not sure how many other cars on the road have the sensor</p>
<p>suite, but I would be surprised if it&rsquo;s more than 5,000, which means that we</p>
<p>have 99% of all the data.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s this huge inflow of data.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Massive inflow of data, and then we, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s taken us about three years, but now</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve finally developed our full self driving computer, which can process, uh,</p>
<p>and in order of magnitude as much as the Nvidia system that we currently have in</p>
<p>the, in the cars, and it&rsquo;s really just a, to use it, you&rsquo;ve unplugged the Nvidia</p>
<p>computer and plug the Tesla computer in and that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s, uh, in fact, we&rsquo;re not even, we&rsquo;re still exploring the boundaries</p>
<p>of capabilities, uh, but we&rsquo;re able to run the cameras at full frame rate, full</p>
<p>resolution, uh, not even crop the images and it&rsquo;s still got headroom even on one</p>
<p>of the systems, the harder full self driving computer is really two computers,</p>
<p>two systems on a chip that are fully redundant.</p>
<p>So you could put a bolt through basically any part of that system and it still</p>
<p>works.</p>
<p>The redundancy, are they perfect copies of each other or also it&rsquo;s purely for</p>
<p>redundancy as opposed to an argue machine kind of architecture where they&rsquo;re both</p>
<p>making decisions.</p>
<p>This is purely for redundancy.</p>
<p>I think it would more like it&rsquo;s, if you have a twin engine aircraft, uh, commercial</p>
<p>aircraft, the system will operate best if both systems are operating, but it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s capable of operating safely on one.</p>
<p>So, but as it is right now, we can just run, we&rsquo;re, we haven&rsquo;t even hit the, the,</p>
<p>the edge of performance.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s no need to actually distribute functionality across both SOCs.</p>
<p>We can actually just run a full duplicate on, on, on each one.</p>
<p>Do you haven&rsquo;t really explored or hit the limit of this?</p>
<p>Not yet at the limiter.</p>
<p>So the magic of deep learning is that it gets better with data.</p>
<p>You said there&rsquo;s a huge inflow of data, but the thing about driving the really</p>
<p>valuable data to learn from is the edge cases.</p>
<p>So how do you, I mean, I&rsquo;ve, I&rsquo;ve heard you talk somewhere about, uh, autopilot</p>
<p>disengagements being an important moment of time to use.</p>
<p>Is there other edge cases where you can, you know, you can, you can, you can</p>
<p>drive, is there other edge cases or perhaps can you speak to those edge cases?</p>
<p>What aspects of that might be valuable or if you have other ideas, how to</p>
<p>discover more and more and more edge cases in driving?</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s a lot of things that are learned.</p>
<p>There are certainly edge cases where I say somebody is on autopilot and they,</p>
<p>they take over and then, okay, that, that, that, that&rsquo;s a trigger that goes to our</p>
<p>system that says, okay, did they take over for convenience or do they take</p>
<p>over because the autopilot wasn&rsquo;t working properly.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also like, let&rsquo;s say we&rsquo;re, we&rsquo;re trying to figure out what is the optimal</p>
<p>spline for traversing an intersection.</p>
<p>Um, then then the ones where there are no interventions and are the right ones.</p>
<p>So you then say, okay, when it looks like this, do the following.</p>
<p>And then, and then you get the optimal spline for a complex, uh,</p>
<p>navigating a complex, uh, intersection.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s for this.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s kind of the common case you&rsquo;re trying to, uh, capture a huge amount of</p>
<p>samples of a particular intersection, how, when things went right, and then</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s the edge case where, uh, as you said, not for convenience, but</p>
<p>something didn&rsquo;t go exactly right.</p>
<p>Somebody took over, somebody asserted manual control from autopilot.</p>
<p>And really like the way to look at this as view all input is error.</p>
<p>If the user had to do input, it does something all input is error.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a powerful line.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a powerful line to think of it that way, because they may very well be</p>
<p>error, but if you want to exit the highway, or if you want to, uh, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a navigation decision that all autopilot is not currently designed to do.</p>
<p>Then the driver takes over.</p>
<p>How do you know the difference?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s going to change with navigate an autopilot, which we were just</p>
<p>released and without still confirm.</p>
<p>So the navigation, like lane change based, like a certain control in</p>
<p>order to change, do a lane change or exit a freeway or, or doing a highway</p>
<p>under change, the vast majority of that will go away with, um, the</p>
<p>release that just went out.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So that, that I don&rsquo;t think people quite understand how big of a step that is.</p>
<p>Yeah, they don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>So if you drive the car, then you do.</p>
<p>So you still have to keep your hands on the steering wheel currently when</p>
<p>it does the automatic lane change.</p>
<p>What are, so there&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s these big leaps through the development of</p>
<p>autopilot through its history and what stands out to you as the big leaps?</p>
<p>I would say this one, navigate an autopilot without, uh, confirm</p>
<p>without having to confirm is a huge leap.</p>
<p>It is a huge leap.</p>
<p>It also automatically overtakes low cars.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s both navigation, um, and seeking the fastest lane.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;ll, it&rsquo;ll, it&rsquo;ll, you know, overtake a slow cause, um, and exit the</p>
<p>freeway and take highway interchanges.</p>
<p>And, and then, uh, we have, uh, traffic lights, uh, recognition, which</p>
<p>introduced initially as a, as a warning.</p>
<p>I mean, on the development version that I&rsquo;m driving, the car fully, fully</p>
<p>stops and goes at traffic lights.</p>
<p>So those are the steps, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve just mentioned something sort of inkling a step towards full autonomy.</p>
<p>What would you say are the biggest technological roadblocks</p>
<p>to full self driving?</p>
<p>Actually, I don&rsquo;t think, I think we just, the full self driving computer that we</p>
<p>just, uh, that the Tesla, what we call the FSD computer, uh, that that&rsquo;s now in</p>
<p>production.</p>
<p>Uh, so if you order, uh, any model SRX or any model three that has the full self</p>
<p>driving package, you&rsquo;ll get the FSD computer.</p>
<p>That, that was, that&rsquo;s important to have enough, uh, base computation, uh, then</p>
<p>refining the neural net and the control software, uh, which, but all of that can</p>
<p>just be provided as an over there update.</p>
<p>The thing that&rsquo;s really profound and where I&rsquo;ll be emphasizing at the, uh, sort</p>
<p>of what that investor day that we&rsquo;re having focused on autonomy is that the</p>
<p>cars currently being produced with the hardware currently being produced is</p>
<p>capable of full self driving, but capable is an interesting word because, um, like</p>
<p>the hardware is, and as we refine the software, the capabilities will increase</p>
<p>dramatically, um, and then the reliability will increase dramatically, and then it</p>
<p>will receive regulatory approval.</p>
<p>So essentially buying a car today is an investment in the future.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re essentially buying a car, you&rsquo;re buying the, I think the most profound</p>
<p>thing is that if you buy a Tesla today, I believe you are buying an appreciating</p>
<p>asset, not a depreciating asset.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a really important statement there because if hardware is capable</p>
<p>enough, that&rsquo;s the hard thing to upgrade usually.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>So then the rest is a software problem.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Software has no marginal cost really.</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s your intuition on the software side?</p>
<p>How hard are the remaining steps to, to get it to where, um, you know, uh, the,</p>
<p>the experience, uh, not just the safety, but the full experience is something</p>
<p>that people would, uh, enjoy.</p>
<p>Well, I think people enjoy it very much so on, on, on the highways.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s a total game changer for quality of life for using, you know,</p>
<p>Tesla autopilot on the highways, uh, so it&rsquo;s really just extending that</p>
<p>functionality to city streets, adding in the traffic light recognition, uh,</p>
<p>navigating complex intersections and, um, and then, uh, being able to navigate</p>
<p>complicated parking lots so the car can, uh, exit a parking space and come and</p>
<p>find you, even if it&rsquo;s in a complete maze of a parking lot, um, and, and, and,</p>
<p>and then if, and then you can just, it can just drop you off and find a</p>
<p>parking spot by itself.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>In terms of enjoyability and something that people would, uh, would actually</p>
<p>find a lot of use from the parking lot is a, is a really, you know, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>rich of annoyance when you have to do it manually.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a lot of benefit to be gained from automation there.</p>
<p>So let me start injecting the human into this discussion a little bit.</p>
<p>Uh, so let&rsquo;s talk about, uh, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the,</p>
<p>about full autonomy.</p>
<p>If you look at the current level four vehicles being tested on</p>
<p>road, like Waymo and so on, they&rsquo;re only technically autonomous.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re really level two systems with just the different design philosophy,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s always a safety driver in almost all cases and</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re monitoring the system.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Do you see Tesla&rsquo;s full self driving as still for a time to come requiring</p>
<p>supervision of the human being.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s capabilities are powerful enough to drive, but nevertheless requires</p>
<p>the human to still be supervising, just like a safety driver is in a</p>
<p>other fully autonomous vehicles.</p>
<p>I think it will require detecting hands on wheel for at least, uh, six months</p>
<p>or something like that from here.</p>
<p>It really is a question of like, from a regulatory standpoint, uh, what, how much</p>
<p>safer than a person does autopilot need to be for it to be okay to not monitor</p>
<p>the car, you know, and, and this is a debate that one can have it.</p>
<p>And then if you, but you need, you know, a large sample, a large amount of data.</p>
<p>Um, so you can prove with high confidence, statistically speaking, that the car is</p>
<p>dramatically safer than a person, um, and that adding in the person monitoring</p>
<p>does not materially affect the safety.</p>
<p>So it might need to be like two or 300% safer than a person.</p>
<p>And how do you prove that incidents per mile incidents per mile crashes and</p>
<p>fatalities, fatalities would be a factor, but there, there are just not enough</p>
<p>fatalities to be statistically significant at scale, but there are enough.</p>
<p>Crashes, you know, there are far more crashes than there are fatalities.</p>
<p>So you can assess what is the probability of a crash that then there&rsquo;s another step</p>
<p>which probability of injury and probability of permanent injury, the</p>
<p>probability of death, and all of those need to be a much better than a person,</p>
<p>uh, by at least perhaps 200%.</p>
<p>And you think there&rsquo;s, uh, the ability to have a healthy discourse with the</p>
<p>regulatory bodies on this topic?</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s no question that, um, but, um, regulators pay just disproportionate</p>
<p>amount of attention to that, which generates press.</p>
<p>This is just an objective fact.</p>
<p>Um, and Tesla generates a lot of press.</p>
<p>So the, you know, in the United States, this, I think almost, you know,</p>
<p>uh, in the United States, this, I think almost 40,000 automotive deaths per year.</p>
<p>Uh, but if there are four in Tesla, they&rsquo;ll probably receive a thousand</p>
<p>times more press than anyone else.</p>
<p>So the, the psychology of that is actually fascinating.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ll have enough time to talk about that, but I have to talk to</p>
<p>you about the human side of things.</p>
<p>So myself and our team at MIT recently released the paper on functional</p>
<p>vigilance of drivers while using autopilot.</p>
<p>This is work we&rsquo;ve been doing since autopilot was first released publicly</p>
<p>over three years ago, collecting video of driver faces and driver body.</p>
<p>So I saw that you tweeted a quote from the abstract, so I can at least, uh,</p>
<p>guess that you&rsquo;ve glanced at it.</p>
<p>Yeah, I read it.</p>
<p>Can I talk you through what we found?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So it appears that in the data that we&rsquo;ve collected, that drivers are maintaining</p>
<p>functional vigilance such that we&rsquo;re looking at 18,000 disengagement from</p>
<p>autopilot, 18,900 and annotating, were they able to take over control in a timely</p>
<p>manner?</p>
<p>So they were there present looking at the road, uh, to take over control.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So this, uh, goes against what, what many would predict from the body of literature</p>
<p>on vigilance with automation.</p>
<p>Now, the question is, do you think these results hold across the broader</p>
<p>population?</p>
<p>So ours is just a small subset.</p>
<p>Do you think, uh, one of the criticism is that, you know, there&rsquo;s a small</p>
<p>minority of drivers that may be highly responsible where their vigilance</p>
<p>decrement would increase with autopilot use?</p>
<p>I think this is all really going to be swept.</p>
<p>I mean, the system&rsquo;s improving so much, so fast that this is going to be a mood</p>
<p>point very soon where vigilance is like, if something&rsquo;s many times safer than a</p>
<p>person, then adding a person, uh, does the, the, the effect on safety is, is</p>
<p>limited.</p>
<p>Um, and in fact, uh, it could be negative.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really interesting.</p>
<p>So the, uh, the, so the fact that a human may, some percent of the population may,</p>
<p>uh, exhibit a vigilance decrement will not affect overall statistics numbers of</p>
<p>safety.</p>
<p>No, in fact, I think it will become, uh, very, very quickly, maybe even towards</p>
<p>the end of this year, but I&rsquo;d say I&rsquo;d be shocked if it&rsquo;s not next year.</p>
<p>At the latest, that, um, having the person, having a human intervene will</p>
<p>decrease safety decrease.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, imagine if you&rsquo;re an elevator and it used to be that there were</p>
<p>elevator operators, um, and, and you couldn&rsquo;t go on an elevator by yourself</p>
<p>and work the lever to move between floors.</p>
<p>Um, and now, uh, nobody wants it an elevator operator because the automated</p>
<p>elevator that stops the floors is much safer than the elevator operator.</p>
<p>And in fact, it would be quite dangerous to have someone with a lever that can</p>
<p>move the elevator between floors.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a, that&rsquo;s a really powerful statement and really interesting one.</p>
<p>But I also have to ask from a user experience and from a safety perspective,</p>
<p>one of the passions for me algorithmically is a camera based detection of, uh,</p>
<p>of just sensing the human, but detecting what the driver is looking at, cognitive</p>
<p>load, body pose on the computer vision side, that&rsquo;s a fascinating problem.</p>
<p>But do you, and there&rsquo;s many in industry believe you have to have</p>
<p>camera based driver monitoring.</p>
<p>Do you think there could be benefit gained from driver monitoring?</p>
<p>If you have a system that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s at, that&rsquo;s at or below a human level</p>
<p>reliability, then driver monitoring makes sense.</p>
<p>But if your system is dramatically better, more likely to be</p>
<p>better, more liable than, than a human, then drive monitoring monitoring</p>
<p>is not just not help much.</p>
<p>And, uh, like I said, you, you, just like, as an, you wouldn&rsquo;t want someone</p>
<p>into like, you wouldn&rsquo;t want someone in the elevator, if you&rsquo;re in an elevator,</p>
<p>do you really want someone with a big lever, some, some random person</p>
<p>operating the elevator between floors?</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t trust that or rather have the buttons.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re optimistic about the pace of improvement of the system that from</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;ve seen with the full self driving car computer, the rate</p>
<p>of improvement is exponential.</p>
<p>So one of the other very interesting design choices early on that connects</p>
<p>to this is the operational design domain of autopilot.</p>
<p>So where autopilot is able to be turned on the, so contrast another vehicle</p>
<p>system that we&rsquo;re studying is the Cadillac SuperCrew system.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s in terms of ODD, very constrained to particular kinds of highways, well</p>
<p>mapped, tested, but it&rsquo;s much narrower than the ODD of Tesla vehicles.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s pros and&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like ADD.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a, that&rsquo;s a good line.</p>
<p>Uh, what was the design decision, uh, what, in that different philosophy</p>
<p>of thinking where there&rsquo;s pros and cons, what we see with, uh, a wide ODD</p>
<p>is drive Tesla drivers are able to explore more the limitations of the</p>
<p>system, at least early on, and they understand together with the instrument</p>
<p>cluster display, they start to understand what are the capabilities.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a benefit.</p>
<p>The con is you go, you&rsquo;re letting drivers use it basically anywhere.</p>
<p>So anyway, that could detect lanes with confidence.</p>
<p>Was there a philosophy, uh, design decisions that were challenging</p>
<p>that were being made there or from the very beginning, was that, uh,</p>
<p>done on purpose with intent?</p>
<p>Well, I mean, I think it&rsquo;s frankly, it&rsquo;s pretty crazy giving it, letting people</p>
<p>drive a two ton death machine manually.</p>
<p>Uh, that&rsquo;s crazy.</p>
<p>Like, like in the future of people who are like, I can&rsquo;t believe anyone was</p>
<p>just allowed to drive for one of these two ton death machines and they</p>
<p>just drive wherever they wanted.</p>
<p>Just like elevators.</p>
<p>He was like, move the elevator with that lever, wherever you want.</p>
<p>It can stop at halfway between floors if you want.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty crazy.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s going to seem like a mad thing in the future that people were driving cars.</p>
<p>So I have a bunch of questions about the human psychology, about behavior and so</p>
<p>on that would become that because, uh, you have faith in the AI system, uh, not</p>
<p>faith, but, uh, the, both on the hardware side and the deep learning approach of</p>
<p>learning from data will make it just far safer than humans.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>Recently, there are a few hackers who, uh, tricked autopilot to act in</p>
<p>unexpected ways with adversarial examples.</p>
<p>So we all know that neural network systems are very sensitive to minor</p>
<p>disturbances to these adversarial examples on input.</p>
<p>Do you think it&rsquo;s possible to defend against something like this for the</p>
<p>broader, for the industry?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>So can you elaborate on the, on the confidence behind that answer?</p>
<p>Um, well the, you know, neural net is just like a basic bunch of matrix math.</p>
<p>Or you have to be like a very sophisticated, somebody who really</p>
<p>understands neural nets and like basically reverse engineer how the matrix</p>
<p>is being built and then create a little thing that&rsquo;s just exactly, um, causes</p>
<p>the matrix math to be slightly off.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s very easy to then block it, block that by, by having basically</p>
<p>anti negative recognition.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like if you, if the system sees something that looks like a matrix hack,</p>
<p>uh, exclude it, so it&rsquo;s such an easy thing to do.</p>
<p>So learn both on the, the valid data and the invalid data.</p>
<p>So basically learn on the adversarial examples to be able to exclude them.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Like you basically want to both know what is, what is a car and</p>
<p>what is definitely not a car.</p>
<p>And you train for this is a car and this is definitely not a car.</p>
<p>Those are two different things.</p>
<p>People have no idea neural nets really.</p>
<p>They probably think neural nets are both like, you know, fishing net only.</p>
<p>So as you know, so taking a step beyond just Tesla and autopilot, uh, current</p>
<p>deep learning approaches still seem in some ways to be far from general</p>
<p>intelligence systems.</p>
<p>Do you think the current approaches will take us to general intelligence or do</p>
<p>totally new ideas need to be invented?</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re missing a few key ideas for general intelligence, general artificial</p>
<p>general intelligence, but it&rsquo;s going to be upon us very quickly.</p>
<p>And then we&rsquo;ll need to figure out what shall we do if we even have that choice?</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s amazing how people can&rsquo;t differentiate between say the narrow</p>
<p>AI that, you know, allows a car to figure out what a lane line is and, and, and,</p>
<p>you know, and navigate streets versus general intelligence.</p>
<p>Like these are just very different things.</p>
<p>Like your toaster and your computer are both machines, but one&rsquo;s much</p>
<p>more sophisticated than another.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re confident with Tesla.</p>
<p>You can create the world&rsquo;s best toaster.</p>
<p>The world&rsquo;s best toaster.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>The world&rsquo;s best toaster. Yes. The world&rsquo;s best self driving. I&rsquo;m, I, yes.</p>
<p>To me right now, this seems game set match.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t, I mean, that sounds, I don&rsquo;t want to be complacent or overconfident,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s what it appears.</p>
<p>That is just literally what it, how it appears right now.</p>
<p>I could be wrong, but it appears to be the case that Tesla is vastly ahead of</p>
<p>everyone.</p>
<p>Do you think we will ever create an AI system that we can love and loves us back</p>
<p>in a deep, meaningful way?</p>
<p>Like in the movie, her, I think AI will be capable of convincing you to fall in</p>
<p>love with it very well.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s different than us humans.</p>
<p>You know, we start getting into a metaphysical question of like, do emotions</p>
<p>and thoughts exist in a different realm than the physical?</p>
<p>And maybe they do.</p>
<p>Maybe they don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>But from a physics standpoint, I tend to think of things, you know, like physics</p>
<p>was my main sort of training and from a physics standpoint, essentially, if it</p>
<p>loves you in a way that is, that you can&rsquo;t tell whether it&rsquo;s real or not, it is</p>
<p>real.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a physics view of love.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s no, if you cannot just, if you cannot prove that it does not, if there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>no, if there&rsquo;s no test that you can apply that would make it, allow you to tell the</p>
<p>difference, then there is no difference.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s similar to seeing our world as simulation.</p>
<p>There may not be a test to tell the difference between what the real world</p>
<p>and the simulation, and therefore from a physics perspective, it might as well be</p>
<p>the same thing.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And there may be ways to test whether it&rsquo;s a simulation.</p>
<p>There might be, I&rsquo;m not saying there aren&rsquo;t, but you could certainly imagine</p>
<p>that a simulation could correct that once an entity in the simulation found a way</p>
<p>to detect the simulation, it could either restart, you know, pause the simulation,</p>
<p>start a new simulation, or do one of many other things that then corrects for that</p>
<p>error.</p>
<p>So when maybe you or somebody else creates an AGI system and you get to ask</p>
<p>her one question, what would that question be?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s outside the simulation?</p>
<p>Elon, thank you so much for talking today.</p>
<p>It was a pleasure.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
