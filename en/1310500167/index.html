    <p>The following is a conversation with Eric Weinstein,</p>
<p>his fourth time on the podcast.</p>
<p>Both sadness and hope run through his heart and his mind,</p>
<p>and the result is a complicated, brilliant human being</p>
<p>who I am fortunate to call a friend.</p>
<p>Quick mention of our sponsors.</p>
<p>Indeed hiring site, Theragun muscle recovery device,</p>
<p>Wine Access online wine store,</p>
<p>and Blinkist app that summarizes books.</p>
<p>Click the sponsor links to get a discount</p>
<p>and to support this podcast.</p>
<p>As a side note, let me ask</p>
<p>that whenever we touch difficult topics in this</p>
<p>or other conversations, that you listen with an open mind</p>
<p>and forgive me or the guest for a misstep</p>
<p>in an imperfectly thought out statement.</p>
<p>To have any chance at truth,</p>
<p>I think we have to take risks</p>
<p>and make mistakes in conversation</p>
<p>and then learn from those mistakes.</p>
<p>Please try not to close your mind and heart to others</p>
<p>because of a single sentence or an expression of an idea.</p>
<p>Try to assume that the people in this conversation</p>
<p>or just people in general are good,</p>
<p>but not perfect and far from it,</p>
<p>but always striving to add a bit more love into the world</p>
<p>in whatever way we know how.</p>
<p>If you enjoy this thing, subscribe on YouTube,</p>
<p>review it on Apple Podcast, follow on Spotify,</p>
<p>support it on Patreon,</p>
<p>or connect with me on Twitter at Lex Friedman.</p>
<p>And now here&rsquo;s my conversation with Eric Weinstein.</p>
<p>You often talk about getting off this planet</p>
<p>and I think you don&rsquo;t often talk</p>
<p>about extra terrestrial life, intelligent life out there.</p>
<p>Do you wonder about this kind of thing,</p>
<p>about intelligent civilizations out there?</p>
<p>I do, but I try to not wonder about it in a particular way.</p>
<p>In a certain sense, I do find that speculating</p>
<p>about Bigfoot and the Loch Ness Monster and space aliens</p>
<p>is kind of a recreation</p>
<p>for when things aren&rsquo;t going very well.</p>
<p>At least it gives us some meaning and purpose in our lives.</p>
<p>So I worry about, for example,</p>
<p>the simulation hypothesis is taking over from religion.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t quite believe enough to go to church</p>
<p>or synagogue or the mosque on the weekend,</p>
<p>so then you just take up an interest in simulation theory</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s something like what you do</p>
<p>for your job coding.</p>
<p>I do think that in some sense,</p>
<p>the issue of aliens is a really interesting one,</p>
<p>but has been spoiled by too much</p>
<p>sort of recreational escapism.</p>
<p>The key question that I find is let&rsquo;s assume</p>
<p>that it is possible to look out at the night sky</p>
<p>and see all of these distant worlds and then go visit them.</p>
<p>If that is possible, it&rsquo;s almost certainly possible</p>
<p>through some as yet unknown or not accepted theory</p>
<p>of physics beyond Einstein.</p>
<p>And I mean, it doesn&rsquo;t have to be that way, but probably is.</p>
<p>If that theory exists, there would be a percentage</p>
<p>of the worlds that have life</p>
<p>in sort of a Drake equation kind of a way</p>
<p>that would have encountered the ability to escape</p>
<p>soon enough after unlocking the power of the atom</p>
<p>at a minimum and whatever they have</p>
<p>that is probably analogous to the cell on that world.</p>
<p>So assuming that life is a fairly generic thing</p>
<p>that arises, probably not carbon based,</p>
<p>probably doesn&rsquo;t have DNA,</p>
<p>but that something that fits the pattern</p>
<p>of Darwinian theory, which is descent with variation,</p>
<p>differential success.</p>
<p>And thereby constantly improving and so on</p>
<p>that through time, there&rsquo;ll be a trajectory</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;ll be something increasingly complex</p>
<p>and fascinating and beautiful like us humans, but much more.</p>
<p>That can also off gas whatever entropy it creates</p>
<p>to give an illusion that you&rsquo;re defeating thermodynamics.</p>
<p>So whatever these things are probably has an analog</p>
<p>of the biolipid layer so that cells can get rid</p>
<p>of the chaos on one side of the barrier</p>
<p>and keep order on the other.</p>
<p>Whatever these things are that create life,</p>
<p>assuming that there is a theory to be found</p>
<p>that allows that civilization to diversify,</p>
<p>we would have to imagine that such a civilization</p>
<p>might have taken an interest in its concept</p>
<p>of the universe and have come here.</p>
<p>They would come here, they would have a deep understanding</p>
<p>of the physics of the universe sufficient</p>
<p>to have arrived here.</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s two questions,</p>
<p>whether they could arrive physically</p>
<p>and whether their information could be sent here</p>
<p>and whether they could gain information from us.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s possible that they would have a way</p>
<p>of looking into our world without actually reaching it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>But yes, if my hope, which is that we can escape this world,</p>
<p>can be realized, if that&rsquo;s feasible,</p>
<p>then you would have to imagine that the reverse is true</p>
<p>and that somebody else should be here.</p>
<p>First of all, I wanna say this.</p>
<p>My purpose when I come on to your show</p>
<p>and I reframe the questions is not to challenge you.</p>
<p>I can sit inside all of those.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s to give you better audio and video</p>
<p>because I think we&rsquo;ve been on an incredible role.</p>
<p>I really love what you do.</p>
<p>And so I am trying to honor you by being as disagreeable</p>
<p>about frame breaking as possible.</p>
<p>I think some of your listeners don&rsquo;t understand</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s actually a sign of respect</p>
<p>as opposed to some sort of a complex dynamic,</p>
<p>which is I think you can play outside of some of the frames</p>
<p>and that these are sort of offerings</p>
<p>to get the conversation started.</p>
<p>So let me try to break that frame</p>
<p>and give you something different.</p>
<p>Beautiful.</p>
<p>I think what&rsquo;s going on here is that I can prove effectively</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re not thinking about this in very deep terms.</p>
<p>As soon as I say we&rsquo;ve gotta get off this planet,</p>
<p>the number of people who assume</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m talking about faster than light travel is very high</p>
<p>and faster than light travel assumes some sort</p>
<p>of Einsteinian paradigm that then is broken</p>
<p>by some small adjustment.</p>
<p>And I think that that&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>It shows me that our failure to imagine</p>
<p>what could be being said is profound.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have an idea of all of the different ways</p>
<p>in which we might be able to visit distant worlds.</p>
<p>All we think about is, okay,</p>
<p>it must be Einsteinian space times</p>
<p>and then some means of exceeding the speed limit.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s fascinating to me</p>
<p>that we don&rsquo;t really have, we&rsquo;ve lost the ability</p>
<p>to just realize we don&rsquo;t know the framework</p>
<p>and what does it even mean?</p>
<p>So one of the things I think about a lot</p>
<p>is worlds with more than one temporal dimension.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very hard to think about</p>
<p>more than one temporal dimension.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a really strong mental exercise</p>
<p>of breaking the framework in which we think</p>
<p>because most of the frameworks</p>
<p>would have a single temporal dimension, right?</p>
<p>Well, first of all, most of the frameworks</p>
<p>in which we think would have no temporal dimension</p>
<p>would have pure, like in mathematics,</p>
<p>the differential geometry that Riemann came up with</p>
<p>in the 1800s.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t usually talk about</p>
<p>what we would call split signature metrics</p>
<p>or Lorentzian signature.</p>
<p>In fact, if it weren&rsquo;t for relativity,</p>
<p>this would be the most obscure topic out there.</p>
<p>Almost all the work we do is in Euclidean signature</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s this one freakish case</p>
<p>of relativity theory in physics</p>
<p>that uses this one time and the rest spatial dimensions.</p>
<p>Fascinating.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s usually momentary and just looking at space.</p>
<p>Yes, we have these three kinds of equations</p>
<p>that are very important to us.</p>
<p>We have elliptic, hyperbolic and parabolic, right?</p>
<p>And so the idea is if I&rsquo;m chewing gum</p>
<p>after eating garlic bread, when I open my mouth</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve got chewing gum between my lips,</p>
<p>maybe it&rsquo;s gonna form an elliptic object</p>
<p>called a minimal surface.</p>
<p>Then when I pop that and blow through it,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna hear a noise that&rsquo;s gonna travel to you</p>
<p>by a wave equation, which is gonna be hyperbolic.</p>
<p>But then the garlic breath is gonna diffuse towards you</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re eventually gonna be very upset with me</p>
<p>according to a heat equation, which will be parabolic.</p>
<p>So those are the three basic paradigms</p>
<p>for most of the work that we do.</p>
<p>And a lot of the work that we do in mathematics is elliptic,</p>
<p>whereas the physicists are in the hyperbolic case.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t even know what to do</p>
<p>about more than one temporal dimension</p>
<p>because I think almost no one studies that.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t believe you just captured much of modern physics</p>
<p>in the example of chewing gum.</p>
<p>Well, I have an off color one, which I chose not to share,</p>
<p>but hopefully the kids at home can imagine.</p>
<p>Okay, so, okay, that is the place where we come from.</p>
<p>Now, if we want to arrive at a possibility</p>
<p>of breaking the frameworks with two</p>
<p>versus zero temporal dimensions,</p>
<p>how do we even begin to think about that?</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s think about it as you and I getting together</p>
<p>in New York City, okay?</p>
<p>So if you tell me, Eric, I wanna meet you in New York City,</p>
<p>go to the corner of, I don&rsquo;t know, 34th Street</p>
<p>and Third Avenue, and you&rsquo;ll find a building</p>
<p>on the Northwest corner and go up to the 17th floor, right?</p>
<p>So when we have Third Avenue, that&rsquo;s one coordinate,</p>
<p>34th Street, that&rsquo;s the second coordinate,</p>
<p>and go up to the 17th.</p>
<p>And what time is it?</p>
<p>Oh, 12 noon.</p>
<p>All right, well, now imagine that we traded the ability</p>
<p>to get up to a particular height in a building</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s all flat land,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m gonna give you two temporal coordinates.</p>
<p>So meet me at 5 p.m. and 12 noon</p>
<p>at the corner of 34th and Third.</p>
<p>That gets to be too mind blowing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got two separate watches.</p>
<p>And presumably that&rsquo;s just specifying a single point</p>
<p>in those two different dimensions,</p>
<p>but then being able to travel along those dimensions.</p>
<p>Let me see your right hand.</p>
<p>You have no watch on that.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Okay, I&rsquo;m very concerned, Lex,</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re going through life without a wristwatch.</p>
<p>That is my favorite and most valued wristwatch.</p>
<p>I want you to wear it.</p>
<p>This guy is funnier than basically any human on Earth.</p>
<p>Lex, that has been in my family for months.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a Fitbit.</p>
<p>Now, what I want you to understand is Lex Fridman</p>
<p>is now in a position to live in two spatial</p>
<p>and two temporal dimensions unlike the rest of us.</p>
<p>I clearly am only fit for four spatial dimensions.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m frozen, whereas you can double move.</p>
<p>I can double move, which is funny</p>
<p>because this is set in Austin time.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s 4 p.m. and this is set in Los Angeles time.</p>
<p>Well, but that&rsquo;s just with an affine shift in mod 12.</p>
<p>But my point is, wouldn&rsquo;t that be interesting</p>
<p>if there were two separate time scales</p>
<p>and you had to coordinate both of those,</p>
<p>but you didn&rsquo;t have to worry about what floor</p>
<p>of the building because everything was on the ground floor.</p>
<p>That is the confusion that we&rsquo;re having.</p>
<p>And if you do one more show, right,</p>
<p>then they&rsquo;re gonna put a watch on your ankle</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re only gonna have one spatial dimension</p>
<p>that you can move around.</p>
<p>But my claim is that all of these are actually sectors</p>
<p>of my theory in case we&rsquo;re interested in that,</p>
<p>which is geometric unity.</p>
<p>There is a two, two sector and a three, one and a one, three</p>
<p>and a zero, four and a four, zero.</p>
<p>And all of these sectors have some physical reality.</p>
<p>We happen to live in a one, three sector.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s the kind of thinking that we don&rsquo;t do.</p>
<p>When I say we have to get off this planet,</p>
<p>people imagine, oh, okay, it&rsquo;s just Einstein</p>
<p>plus some ability to break the law.</p>
<p>By the way, even though you did this for humor&rsquo;s sake,</p>
<p>I perhaps am tempted to pull a Putin who.</p>
<p>Am I gonna get whacked?</p>
<p>No, not quite.</p>
<p>But he was given a Super Bowl ring to look at</p>
<p>and he, instead of just looking at it,</p>
<p>put it on his finger and walked away with it.</p>
<p>Rubbercraft?</p>
<p>Rubbercraft, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>So in the same way, I will, if you don&rsquo;t mind,</p>
<p>walk away with this Fitbit</p>
<p>and taking the entirety of your life story with it</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s all these steps on it.</p>
<p>Boy, have you lost a lot of weight.</p>
<p>And where have I been?</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Right, that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking about, you wanna get into aliens,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s have an interesting alien conversation.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s stop having the typical free will conversation,</p>
<p>the typical alien conversation,</p>
<p>the typical AGI morality conversation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, we have to recognize that we&rsquo;re amusing ourselves</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re not making progress.</p>
<p>Time to have better versions of all these conversations.</p>
<p>Is there some version of the alien conversation</p>
<p>that could incorporate the breaking of frameworks?</p>
<p>Well, I think so.</p>
<p>I mean, the key question would be,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve had the Pentagon release multiple videos</p>
<p>of strange UFOs that undermined a lot of us.</p>
<p>I just think it&rsquo;s also really fascinating</p>
<p>to talk about the fact that those of us</p>
<p>who were trained to call BS on all of this stuff</p>
<p>just had the rug pulled out from under us</p>
<p>by the Pentagon choosing to do this.</p>
<p>And you know what the effect of that is?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve opened the door for every stupid theory known to man.</p>
<p>My aunt saw a ghost.</p>
<p>Okay, now we&rsquo;re gonna have to listen to,</p>
<p>well, hey, the Pentagon used to deny it.</p>
<p>Then it turned out there were UFOs, dude.</p>
<p>Whoever is in charge of lying to the public,</p>
<p>they need a cost function that incorporates</p>
<p>the damage and trust because I held this line</p>
<p>that this was all garbage and all BS.</p>
<p>Now I don&rsquo;t know what to think.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a fascinating aspect to this alien discussion,</p>
<p>the breaking of frameworks that involves</p>
<p>the release of videos from the Pentagon,</p>
<p>which is almost like another dimension</p>
<p>that trust in itself or the nature of truth and information</p>
<p>is a kind of dimension along which we&rsquo;re traveling</p>
<p>constantly that is messing with my head to think about</p>
<p>because it almost feels like you need to incorporate that</p>
<p>into your study of the nature of reality</p>
<p>is like the constant shifting of the notation,</p>
<p>the tools we use to communicate that reality.</p>
<p>And so what am I supposed to think about these videos?</p>
<p>Is it a complete distraction?</p>
<p>Is it a kind of cosmic joke?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, but you know what?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m tired of these people,</p>
<p>just completely tired of these people.</p>
<p>The people on the Pentagon side</p>
<p>or the people who are interpreting this stuff</p>
<p>on the Pentagon side?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m tired of the authorities playing games</p>
<p>with what we can know.</p>
<p>The fact that you and I don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>do you have a security clearance?</p>
<p>Some level of it for,</p>
<p>because I was funded for DARPA for a while.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have a security clearance.</p>
<p>You know, I am going to release whatever theory I have.</p>
<p>And my guess is that there is zero interest</p>
<p>from our own government.</p>
<p>And so the Chinese will find out about it at the same time,</p>
<p>our government does,</p>
<p>because Lord knows what they do in these buildings.</p>
<p>I watch crazy people walk in and out</p>
<p>of the intelligence community, walk in and out of DARPA.</p>
<p>And I think, wow, you&rsquo;re talking to that person?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really fascinating to me.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t seem to have a clue as to who might have the ball.</p>
<p>Complete lack of transparency.</p>
<p>Do you think it&rsquo;s possible there&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>the government is in possession</p>
<p>of something deeply fundamental</p>
<p>to our understanding of the world</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re not releasing?</p>
<p>So this is one of the things is,</p>
<p>this is one of the famous distractions</p>
<p>that people play with, the narrative.</p>
<p>Assume that that were true.</p>
<p>Of alien life forms and spacecraft in possession,</p>
<p>that the government is in possession of alien spacecraft.</p>
<p>Assume that were true.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think the government really exists at the moment.</p>
<p>I believe, and this is not an idea that was original to me.</p>
<p>There was a guy named Michael Teitelbaum</p>
<p>who used to be at the Sloan Foundation.</p>
<p>And at some point I pointed out that the US government</p>
<p>had completely contradictory objectives</p>
<p>when it came to the military and science.</p>
<p>And one branch said this, one branch said that.</p>
<p>I said, I don&rsquo;t understand which is true.</p>
<p>What does the government want?</p>
<p>He said, do you think there&rsquo;s a government?</p>
<p>And I said, what do you mean?</p>
<p>He said, what makes you think that the people</p>
<p>in those two offices have ever coordinated?</p>
<p>What is it that allows each office</p>
<p>to have a coherent plan with respect to every other office?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s when I first started to understand</p>
<p>that there are periods where the government coheres,</p>
<p>and then there are periods where the coherence just decays.</p>
<p>And I think that that&rsquo;s been going on since 1945.</p>
<p>That there have been a few places</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s been increased coherence,</p>
<p>but in general everything is just getting</p>
<p>less and less coherent.</p>
<p>And that what war did was focus us on the need</p>
<p>to have a government of people, a mission,</p>
<p>capacity, technology, commitment, ideology.</p>
<p>And then as soon as that was gone,</p>
<p>different people, those who&rsquo;d been through World War II</p>
<p>had one set of beliefs, those born in the 1950s</p>
<p>or late 40s by the time they got to Woodstock,</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t buy any of that.</p>
<p>So coherence is the complete opposite</p>
<p>of bureaucracy being paralyzed by bureaucracy.</p>
<p>So coherence is efficient, functional government.</p>
<p>Because when you say there&rsquo;s no government,</p>
<p>meaning there&rsquo;s no emergent function</p>
<p>from a collection of individuals.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a bunch of individuals stuck in their offices</p>
<p>without any kind of efficient communication</p>
<p>with each other on a single mission.</p>
<p>And so a government that is truly at the epitome</p>
<p>of what a government is supposed to be</p>
<p>is when a bunch of people working together.</p>
<p>What are we about?</p>
<p>Are we about freedom?</p>
<p>Are we about growth?</p>
<p>Are we about decency and fairness?</p>
<p>Are we about the absence of a national culture</p>
<p>so that we can all just do our own thing?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve called this thing the USA and the United States</p>
<p>have absolutely nothing.</p>
<p>These are all different visions for our country.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s possible that there&rsquo;s a alien spacecraft somewhere</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s like 20 people that know about it.</p>
<p>And then they&rsquo;re kind of like,</p>
<p>as you communicate further and further into the offices,</p>
<p>that information dissipates,</p>
<p>it gets distorted in some kind of way.</p>
<p>And then it&rsquo;s completely lost the power,</p>
<p>the possibility of that information is lost.</p>
<p>We bought a house and I had this idea</p>
<p>that I wanted to find out what all the switches did.</p>
<p>And I quickly found out that your house</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t keep updating its plans.</p>
<p>As people do modifications,</p>
<p>they just do the modifications</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t actually record</p>
<p>why they were doing what they were doing</p>
<p>or what things lead to.</p>
<p>So there are all sorts of bizarre,</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s a switch in my house that says privacy.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what privacy is.</p>
<p>Does it turn on an electromagnetic field?</p>
<p>Does some lead shielding go over the house?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what we have.</p>
<p>We have a system in which the people</p>
<p>who&rsquo;ve inherited these structures have no idea</p>
<p>why their grandparents built them.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be funny if there&rsquo;s a freedom of speech switch</p>
<p>that you could also control.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;d be a perfect metaphor.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s different because what they figured out is,</p>
<p>is that if they can just make sure</p>
<p>that we don&rsquo;t have any public options for communication,</p>
<p>then hey, everything that we say to each other</p>
<p>goes through a private company,</p>
<p>private companies can do whatever they want.</p>
<p>And this is like one of the greatest moves</p>
<p>that we didn&rsquo;t really notice.</p>
<p>Electronic and digital speech</p>
<p>makes every other kind of speech irrelevant.</p>
<p>And because there is no public option, guess what?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s always somebody named Sundar or Jack or Mark</p>
<p>who controls whether or not you can speak</p>
<p>and what it appears to be that is being said</p>
<p>and whose stuff is weighted more highly than others.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an absolute nightmare.</p>
<p>And by the way, the Silicon Valley intellectual elite,</p>
<p>Lord knows what is going on.</p>
<p>People are so busy making money</p>
<p>that they are not actually upholding any of the values.</p>
<p>So Silicon Valley is sort of maximally against,</p>
<p>it has this kind of libertarian, free, progressive sheen</p>
<p>to it when it goes to Burning Man.</p>
<p>And then it quickly just imposes rules</p>
<p>on all of the rest of us as to what we could say</p>
<p>to each other if we&rsquo;re not part of the inner elite.</p>
<p>So what do you think the ideal</p>
<p>of the freedom of speech means?</p>
<p>Well, this is very interesting.</p>
<p>I keep getting lectured on social media</p>
<p>by people who have no idea how much power</p>
<p>the Supreme Court has to abstract things.</p>
<p>Right now, you have the concept of the letter of the law</p>
<p>and the spirit of the law.</p>
<p>And the spirit of the law would have to say</p>
<p>that our speech that matters is free,</p>
<p>at least at the level of ideas.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t claim that I have the right</p>
<p>to endanger your life with speech</p>
<p>or to reveal your private information.</p>
<p>So I really am not opining about directed speech</p>
<p>intended to smear you.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a different kettle of fish.</p>
<p>And maybe I have some rights to do that,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t think that they&rsquo;re infinite.</p>
<p>What I am saying is that the freedom of speech for ideas</p>
<p>is essential that the court abstract it</p>
<p>and shove it down the throat of Google, Facebook, Twitter,</p>
<p>Amazon, whoever these infrastructure companies are</p>
<p>because it really matters which abstraction you use.</p>
<p>The case that I really like is search and seizure.</p>
<p>If I have private data that I entered in my house</p>
<p>that is stored on a server that you hold outside of my house,</p>
<p>but I view is the abstraction</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s only the perimeter of my house</p>
<p>that I have the right to protect,</p>
<p>or does my password extend the perimeter of my house</p>
<p>to the data on the server</p>
<p>that is located outside of my house?</p>
<p>These are choices for the court, and the court is supposed</p>
<p>to pretend that they can divine the true intent</p>
<p>of the framers.</p>
<p>But all of the sort of, and I&rsquo;ve taken to calling this</p>
<p>the problem of internet hyenas,</p>
<p>people with readymade answers and LOLs,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re such a moron.</p>
<p>These folks love to remind you, it&rsquo;s a private company,</p>
<p>dude, it can do whatever it wants.</p>
<p>No, the court has to figure out what the abstractions are.</p>
<p>And just the way, for example,</p>
<p>the Griswold decision found that there was a penumbra</p>
<p>because there was too little in the Constitution,</p>
<p>therefore there were all sorts of things implied</p>
<p>that couldn&rsquo;t be in the document.</p>
<p>Somebody needs to come up with the abstraction right now</p>
<p>that says Jack cannot do it if he wants.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really, so you say the courts,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also us, people who think about the world,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s you. No, no, no.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the courts.</p>
<p>But the courts don&rsquo;t do this.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re toast.</p>
<p>But we can still think about it.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;ll&hellip;</p>
<p>Sure, but I don&rsquo;t feel like going down the drain.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m thinking about,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s tricky how far it should extend.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s an ongoing conversation.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t you think the interpretation of the law&hellip;</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;m trying to say something very simple,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just not gonna be popular for a while.</p>
<p>Tech dwarfs previous forms of communication.</p>
<p>Print or shouting in a public park.</p>
<p>And so I can go to a public park</p>
<p>and I can shout if I get a permit.</p>
<p>Even there, I think it was in the late 1980s in Atlanta,</p>
<p>we came up with free speech zones</p>
<p>where you can&rsquo;t protest at a convention.</p>
<p>You bet you can go to a park 23 miles out</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll fence off a little area</p>
<p>where you can have your free speech.</p>
<p>No, speech is dangerous.</p>
<p>Ideas are dangerous.</p>
<p>We are a country about danger and risk.</p>
<p>And yes, I agree that targeted speech at individuals</p>
<p>trying to reveal their private stuff</p>
<p>and all that kind of&hellip;</p>
<p>That is very different.</p>
<p>So forget a lot of that stuff.</p>
<p>But free speech for ideas is meant to be dangerous</p>
<p>and people will die as a result of free speech.</p>
<p>The idea that one life is too much is preposterous.</p>
<p>Like why did we send&hellip;</p>
<p>If one life is preposterous,</p>
<p>why did we send anyone to the beaches of Normandy?</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t get this.</p>
<p>So one thing that I was clearly bothered by,</p>
<p>and maybe you can be my therapist as well.</p>
<p>I thought you were mine.</p>
<p>This is a little bit of a miscommunication</p>
<p>on both of our parts then.</p>
<p>Because who&rsquo;s paying who for this?</p>
<p>I was really bothered by Amazon banning Parler from AWS</p>
<p>because my assumption was that the infrastructure&hellip;</p>
<p>I drew a distinction between AWS,</p>
<p>the infrastructure on which competing platforms</p>
<p>could be created is different than the actual platforms.</p>
<p>So the standard of the ideal of freedom of speech,</p>
<p>I, in my mind, in a shallow way perhaps,</p>
<p>applied differently to AWS than I did to Twitter.</p>
<p>It felt that we&rsquo;ve created a more dangerous world,</p>
<p>that freedoms were violated by banning Parler from AWS,</p>
<p>which I saw as the computing infrastructure</p>
<p>which enables the competition of tools,</p>
<p>the competition of frameworks of communication.</p>
<p>What do you think about this?</p>
<p>First of all, let me give you the internet hyena answer.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t understand, dude, just build your own Amazon.</p>
<p>Yeah. Right?</p>
<p>Yes. Well, so that&rsquo;s a very shallow statement,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also one that has some legitimacy.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t completely dismiss it</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s levels to this game.</p>
<p>Yes and no, but if you really wanted to chase that down,</p>
<p>one of the great things about a person to person conversation</p>
<p>as opposed to let&rsquo;s have 30 of our closest friends,</p>
<p>whenever we have a conversation</p>
<p>with 30 of our closest friends, you know what happens?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like passing light through a prism.</p>
<p>Every person says something interesting.</p>
<p>And as a result, it&rsquo;s always muddled.</p>
<p>Nothing ever resolves.</p>
<p>Well, one of my conversational techniques you mentioned,</p>
<p>you pushed back is first this childlike naivety</p>
<p>and curiosity, but also.</p>
<p>Real or simulated?</p>
<p>Real, I&rsquo;m afraid.</p>
<p>I would say 80% real.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>So in this paradigm, how could you not see this coming?</p>
<p>I mean, I did a show with Ashley Matthews,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s the woman behind Riley Reid.</p>
<p>And specifically about this, it was about the idea</p>
<p>that if I move away from politics and go towards sex,</p>
<p>I know that there&rsquo;s always a move to use the infrastructure</p>
<p>to shut down sex workers.</p>
<p>And in this case, we had Operation Choke Point</p>
<p>under the Obama administration.</p>
<p>We have a positive passion for people</p>
<p>who want to solve problems,</p>
<p>that they don&rsquo;t like this company,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t like that company,</p>
<p>payday loans would be another one.</p>
<p>And so you have legal companies</p>
<p>that are harassed by our financial system</p>
<p>that you can&rsquo;t, as Riley Reid,</p>
<p>Ashley couldn&rsquo;t get a Mailchimp account according to her,</p>
<p>if I understand her correctly.</p>
<p>And this idea that you charge these people higher rates</p>
<p>because of supposed chargebacks on credit cards,</p>
<p>even if their chargebacks are low.</p>
<p>Yes, we have an unofficial policy of harassment.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something about everybody who shows up at Davos,</p>
<p>they get drunk in the Swiss Alps,</p>
<p>and then they come back home and they coordinate,</p>
<p>and they coordinate things like Build Back Better.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t really understand what Build Back Better is,</p>
<p>but my guess is that Build Back Better</p>
<p>has to do with extremism in America.</p>
<p>How do we shut down the Republican Party</p>
<p>as the source of extremism?</p>
<p>Now, I do think the Republican Party</p>
<p>got very extreme under Trump.</p>
<p>And I do believe that that was responsive</p>
<p>to how extreme the Democratic Party got under Clinton first</p>
<p>and then Obama and then Hillary.</p>
<p>And in all of these circumstances,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s amazing how much we want</p>
<p>to wield these things as weapons.</p>
<p>Well, our extremism is fine</p>
<p>because we pretend that Antifa doesn&rsquo;t exist</p>
<p>and we don&rsquo;t report what goes on in Portland,</p>
<p>but your extremism, my God, that&rsquo;s disgusting.</p>
<p>This is the completely ridiculous place that we&rsquo;re in.</p>
<p>And by the way, our friends in part</p>
<p>are coked up on tech money,</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t appear to hold the courage</p>
<p>of their convictions at a political level</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not in keeping with shareholder value.</p>
<p>At some level, shareholder value is the ultimate shield</p>
<p>with which everyone can cloak themselves.</p>
<p>Well, on that point, Donald Trump was banned from Twitter,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m not sure it was a good financial decision</p>
<p>for Twitter, right?</p>
<p>Perhaps you can correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong.</p>
<p>Well, are you thinking locally,</p>
<p>or are you thinking if Twitter refused to ban Donald Trump,</p>
<p>what is the odds that the full force</p>
<p>of the antitrust division might find them?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Oh, I see, I see.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a complicated thing.</p>
<p>Well, look, these guys are all having a discussion</p>
<p>in very practical terms.</p>
<p>You can imagine the sorts of things</p>
<p>and imagine the sorts of conversation.</p>
<p>Jack, Mark, Zunder, we&rsquo;re really glad you&rsquo;re all here.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re all trying to sing from the same hymnal</p>
<p>and row in the same direction.</p>
<p>We understand free speech.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re completely committed to it,</p>
<p>but we have to draw a line with extremism, guys.</p>
<p>We just need to make sure that we&rsquo;re all on the same page.</p>
<p>Well, they use the term violence, too,</p>
<p>and they, I think, over apply it.</p>
<p>So basically, anybody&hellip;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m telling you, I say dumb things</p>
<p>to incentivize thoughtful conversation.</p>
<p>Well, whatever these things are, there is no trace.</p>
<p>Like, how old are you, Lex?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re in your mid 30s?</p>
<p>Yeah, to late 40s.</p>
<p>Mid, late 20s to late 40s, somewhere in there.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the demographic, yes.</p>
<p>I do think that partially what&rsquo;s happened</p>
<p>is that your group has never seen functional institutions.</p>
<p>These institutions have been so compromised for so long.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve probably never seen an adult.</p>
<p>Sometimes I think Elon looks like an adult.</p>
<p>I know that he has a wild lifestyle,</p>
<p>but I also see it looking like an adult.</p>
<p>What does an adult look like exactly?</p>
<p>Oh, you know, somebody who weighs things, speaks carefully,</p>
<p>thinks about the future beyond their own lifespan.</p>
<p>Somebody who has a pretty good idea of how to get things done,</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t wildly caught up in punitive actions,</p>
<p>is more focused on breaking new ground</p>
<p>than playing rent seeking games.</p>
<p>I mean, I really had a positive&hellip;</p>
<p>I was so completely jazzed when Elon Musk ended up</p>
<p>as the world&rsquo;s richest person.</p>
<p>He was like, well, that&rsquo;s interesting, back to work.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like, that&rsquo;s what an adult would do.</p>
<p>And it just made, you know, weirdly,</p>
<p>I said something about, isn&rsquo;t it amazing</p>
<p>that the world&rsquo;s richest person knows what a Lagrangian is?</p>
<p>And he made a terrible Lagrange joke about potentials.</p>
<p>But yeah, I mean, I do think that ultimately,</p>
<p>Elon may be one of the closest things we have to an adult.</p>
<p>And I can tell you that the internet hyenas</p>
<p>will immediately descend as to what a fraudster he is</p>
<p>for pumping his stock price,</p>
<p>talking his book and all this stuff.</p>
<p>Shut up.</p>
<p>Just looking at the world seriously and really saying,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re saying that the people who are running tech companies</p>
<p>or running the mediums on which we can exercise</p>
<p>the ideal of free speech are not adults.</p>
<p>I think not.</p>
<p>I think, first of all, a lot of them</p>
<p>are Silicon Valley utopian businessmen,</p>
<p>where you talk a utopian line and you use it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve heard my take, which is that the idealism</p>
<p>of every era is the cover story of its greatest thefts.</p>
<p>And I believe that in many ways,</p>
<p>the idealism of Silicon Valley about connecting the world,</p>
<p>the world of abundance, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera,</p>
<p>is really about the software eating the world</p>
<p>as Mark Andreessen likes to say,</p>
<p>that there were all these legacy properties</p>
<p>and by simply being a bad tech version</p>
<p>of something that previously existed like a newspaper,</p>
<p>you could immediately start to dwarf that</p>
<p>by aggregating newspapers and their digital versions</p>
<p>because digital is so much more powerful.</p>
<p>As a result, yes, we have lots of man children</p>
<p>wandering around what once was the Bay Area</p>
<p>and is now Austin and Miami and other places,</p>
<p>maybe Singapore, that all of these people,</p>
<p>these are friends of ours and they&rsquo;re brilliant</p>
<p>with respect to a certain amount of stuff,</p>
<p>but none of them can get off the drip.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s amazing that none of them have FU money.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got billionaires who don&rsquo;t have FU money.</p>
<p>Okay, I think the argument used by Jack Dorsey</p>
<p>was that there was an incitement of violence</p>
<p>and not just Jack Dorsey,</p>
<p>but everybody that was banning people.</p>
<p>And then this word violence was used</p>
<p>as a kind of just like extremism and so on</p>
<p>to without much reason behind it.</p>
<p>You think it&rsquo;s impossible for Jack Dorsey</p>
<p>or anybody else to be, as you said, an adult,</p>
<p>a grownup and reason.</p>
<p>Well, Jack is pretty close to being a grownup.</p>
<p>It seems like he is.</p>
<p>Yeah, but he&rsquo;s under pressures.</p>
<p>As you&rsquo;ve discussed,</p>
<p>it seems that he&rsquo;s been on the verge</p>
<p>of almost being quite serious and transparent</p>
<p>and real with people.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know where the Jack Dorsey that I met went.</p>
<p>And I worry that that must be something behind the scenes</p>
<p>that I can&rsquo;t see.</p>
<p>From my perspective, what I think is the stress,</p>
<p>the burden of that when people are screaming at you</p>
<p>is overwhelming.</p>
<p>No, Jack is a Zen monk.</p>
<p>He really is.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Jack is an incredibly impressive person intellectually,</p>
<p>morally, spiritually, at least for a couple of meetings.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know him very well,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m very impressed by the person I met</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t know where that person is.</p>
<p>And that terrifies me.</p>
<p>But do you think somebody could step up in that way?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>So does a human being have the capacity to be transparent</p>
<p>about the reasoning behind the banning?</p>
<p>Or do you think all banning of people</p>
<p>from mediums of communication is eventually destructive</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s impossible for human beings</p>
<p>to reason with ourselves about it?</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s see what the problem is.</p>
<p>So my phone has been on airplane mode.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna unlock it.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m gonna take a picture of Lex Fridman.</p>
<p>Now, if I can, I&rsquo;m gonna tweet that picture out.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s the weird part about it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That picture sitting with Lex today.</p>
<p>This, ladies and gentlemen, is how the sausage is made.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>In so doing, I have just sent a picture of you</p>
<p>and a tiny piece of text all over the planet</p>
<p>that has arrived at, if statistics tell the truth,</p>
<p>just under half a million different accounts.</p>
<p>And then more from sharing and so on.</p>
<p>Well, and then some of those accounts are dead.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t really know how many places it went.</p>
<p>But the key issue with that tweet</p>
<p>is that that is a nonlocal phenomenon.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So I just broadcasted to an entire planet.</p>
<p>Somebody in Uganda is reading that</p>
<p>at the same time as somebody in Uruguay.</p>
<p>There is no known solution to have so many people</p>
<p>with the ability to communicate nonlocally</p>
<p>because locality was part of the implicit nature of speech</p>
<p>inside of the constitution.</p>
<p>Friction, locality, there were all sorts</p>
<p>of other aspects to speech.</p>
<p>So if you think about speech as a bundle.</p>
<p>I like this.</p>
<p>Then it got unbundled.</p>
<p>And some of those aspects that we were naturally counting on</p>
<p>to retard the impact of speech aren&rsquo;t present.</p>
<p>And we don&rsquo;t have the courage to say,</p>
<p>I wonder if the first amendment really applies</p>
<p>in the modern era in the same way,</p>
<p>or we have to work through an abstraction.</p>
<p>Either we probably have to amend the constitution</p>
<p>or we have to abstract it properly.</p>
<p>And that issue is not something we&rsquo;re facing up to.</p>
<p>I watch us constantly look backwards.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t seem to try to come up with new ideas</p>
<p>and new theories.</p>
<p>Nobody really imagines that we&rsquo;re going to be able</p>
<p>to wisely amend the constitution anymore</p>
<p>in the inside of the United States.</p>
<p>Many people abroad will say,</p>
<p>why are these guys talking about the US?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a US centric program.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s because nobody knows where this program lives.</p>
<p>The fact, by the way, that you and I happen to be</p>
<p>in a physical place together is also bizarre.</p>
<p>It could be anywhere.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t really matter that it happens to be here.</p>
<p>So the difference between logical and between physical,</p>
<p>local, nonlocal, frictional, nonfrictional,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the same thing with firearms.</p>
<p>Nobody imagined that the Gatling gun</p>
<p>was gonna be present when you had to reload a musket.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s fascinating to think about.</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;re exactly right that the nature</p>
<p>of this particular freedom that seems so foundational</p>
<p>to this nation, to what made this nation great</p>
<p>and perhaps much of the world that is great,</p>
<p>made it great, is changing completely.</p>
<p>Can we try to reason through how the ideal freedom</p>
<p>of speech is to be changed?</p>
<p>I mean, I guess I&rsquo;m struggling.</p>
<p>It feels really wrong, perhaps because I wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>paying attention to it.</p>
<p>It feels really wrong to ban Donald Trump from Twitter,</p>
<p>to ban not just the president.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really wrong to me.</p>
<p>But this particular human for being divisive.</p>
<p>But then when there&rsquo;s an incitement of violence,</p>
<p>that is an overused claim.</p>
<p>But perhaps there was actual brewing</p>
<p>of local violence happening.</p>
<p>So one of the things I know was happening on Parler</p>
<p>is people were scheduling meetings together</p>
<p>in physical space.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re now going back from this dynamic, social,</p>
<p>large scale, people from Uganda, people from all</p>
<p>over the world being able to communicate.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re now mapping that into now back meeting</p>
<p>in the physical space that is similar</p>
<p>to what the founding of this nation was.</p>
<p>The violence would be digital</p>
<p>if ransomware suddenly was unleashed.</p>
<p>True.</p>
<p>The key issue is the abstractions.</p>
<p>So what was freedom of speech as a bundle?</p>
<p>And now it&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>And then how do we abstract the bundle</p>
<p>into the digital era?</p>
<p>Do you think we just need to raise the question</p>
<p>and talk about it?</p>
<p>Do you have ideas?</p>
<p>Well, sure I have ideas.</p>
<p>But the key point is that I&rsquo;m not even welcome</p>
<p>in mainstream media.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never seen you on mainstream media.</p>
<p>Do you do mainstream media?</p>
<p>So we exist in part of an alternate universe</p>
<p>because the mainstream media is trying to have</p>
<p>a coherent story, which I&rsquo;ve called</p>
<p>the gated institutional narrative.</p>
<p>And the institutions pretend that,</p>
<p>they plug their fingers in their ears</p>
<p>and pretend that nothing exists outside</p>
<p>of MSNBC talking to CNN about what was</p>
<p>in the New York Times as covered by the Washington Post.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s effectively like a professional</p>
<p>wrestling promotion where they, you know,</p>
<p>the Undertaker faces off against Hulk Hogan</p>
<p>and Rowdy Roddy Piper.</p>
<p>Okay, well, that&rsquo;s very different than MMA.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve recently been on Glenn Beck&rsquo;s program.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And there was this kind of, one of the things</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve talked about is being able to have</p>
<p>this conversation, I don&rsquo;t know if you would put it</p>
<p>as a type of conversation that was happening</p>
<p>outside the mainstream media, but a conversation</p>
<p>that reaches across different world views.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>Being a nuanced, or just like a respectful conversation</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s grounded in mutual.</p>
<p>But we can&rsquo;t have the reality because the main model</p>
<p>is the center, both left and right,</p>
<p>is in the process of stealing all the wealth</p>
<p>that we built up.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ve organized the extremes into two LARPing teams</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve called Magistan and Wokistan.</p>
<p>And then you have everybody who isn&rsquo;t part</p>
<p>of that complex, all seven of us.</p>
<p>The number of us who are able to earn a living</p>
<p>looking at all of these mad people playing this game.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a phrase inside finance when the investment banks</p>
<p>are trying to look at price action.</p>
<p>And somebody says, this doesn&rsquo;t make any sense.</p>
<p>And somebody will say, it&rsquo;s just the locals</p>
<p>stealing from each other.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s really what we have.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got the leaders of Magistan and Wokistan,</p>
<p>championing these two teams is sponsored by the center</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a distraction while they steal all the silver</p>
<p>and cut the paintings out of the frames.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what you and I are looking at.</p>
<p>So when you ask me, do you have any ideas</p>
<p>about the abstraction for free speech?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never met Mark Zuckerberg.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never met Sundar Pichai.</p>
<p>I never met Larry Page.</p>
<p>I was once in a room with Sergey Brin.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never spoken to Elon Musk.</p>
<p>I hang out with Peter Thiel,</p>
<p>but we have a very deep relationship,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t really speak to that many other people</p>
<p>at sort of at this level.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not having any kind of smart conversation</p>
<p>at a national level.</p>
<p>In fact, it&rsquo;s almost as if we&rsquo;ve destroyed every sandbox</p>
<p>in which we could play together.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no place that we actually talk</p>
<p>except long form podcasting.</p>
<p>And by the way, they&rsquo;ve found,</p>
<p>you see what&rsquo;s going on with like Alex Stamos</p>
<p>and the Hoover Institution.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a loophole left.</p>
<p>Long form podcasting allows people to speak</p>
<p>at levels above daytime CNN.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, well, why do you think</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not watching daytime CNN?</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s just silly journalism.</p>
<p>They currently have no power to displace podcasting.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s so powerful, RSS feed.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s why the big challenge with Joe Rogan</p>
<p>and Spotify is like, there&rsquo;s this dance that&rsquo;s fascinating</p>
<p>to see is Joe Rogan is not part of the system</p>
<p>and then he&rsquo;s also uncancellable</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s this tension that&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>Well, think about what happened to Howard Stern though.</p>
<p>Howard Stern became much less relevant.</p>
<p>So if they can&rsquo;t control Joe by bringing him in house,</p>
<p>the key question is, is he going to continue,</p>
<p>like Joe says this thing about FU money.</p>
<p>Joe&rsquo;s one of the only people with FU money</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s actually said FU.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t understand this.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have FU money.</p>
<p>What exactly is, can we break apart FU money?</p>
<p>Because I always thought I&rsquo;ve been fortunate enough</p>
<p>to always have FU money in the sense</p>
<p>that my standards were so low that a basic salary</p>
<p>in the United States.</p>
<p>Well, this is the stoic point,</p>
<p>which is if you can live on rice and beans,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re uncancellable because you&rsquo;re always rich</p>
<p>relative to your needs.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t that FU fundamental, FU money?</p>
<p>Why do you say that tech billionaires don&rsquo;t have FU money?</p>
<p>When you need to hire private security</p>
<p>to protect your family,</p>
<p>how do you protect your two children?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have those yet.</p>
<p>Bingo.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>My point is that FU money insulates everything</p>
<p>that you care about.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just about you.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re saying as the level of responsibility grows,</p>
<p>the amount of money required for FU.</p>
<p>We have a war going on.</p>
<p>The war is on academic freedom.</p>
<p>Academic freedom used to be present in the system</p>
<p>as a, in terms of the idea, we trust our elite.</p>
<p>Now we have an idea like, you wanna be the elite.</p>
<p>You want a Lord above us.</p>
<p>First of all, there&rsquo;s like a populist, anti elitist thing.</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s the idea</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re gonna defer tenure for forever.</p>
<p>Then we&rsquo;re gonna tell people, stay in your lane.</p>
<p>Your tenure is only good</p>
<p>for your own particular tiny micro subject.</p>
<p>Then we&rsquo;re gonna also control your grants</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll be able to load up your teaching load.</p>
<p>If we don&rsquo;t like who you are,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll make your life absolutely impossible.</p>
<p>We lost academic freedom</p>
<p>and we ushered in peer review, which was a disaster.</p>
<p>And then we lost funding</p>
<p>so that people were confident</p>
<p>that they would have the ability to do research</p>
<p>no matter what they said.</p>
<p>And as a result, what you find is,</p>
<p>is a world in which there&rsquo;s no ability</p>
<p>to get people to say, no, I&rsquo;m not gonna sign</p>
<p>your diversity and inclusion forced loyalty oath.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t sign any loyalty oath.</p>
<p>Get the hell out of my office.</p>
<p>FU.</p>
<p>FU, and you&rsquo;re connecting money to that, but.</p>
<p>Well, my point is, is that academic freedom</p>
<p>is the, the whole idea behind it</p>
<p>was that you will have the freedom of a billionaire</p>
<p>on a much smaller salary.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve lost that.</p>
<p>Yeah, the only reason in part</p>
<p>that I wanted to go into academic,</p>
<p>academics as a profession,</p>
<p>as opposed to wanting to do physical</p>
<p>or mathematical research.</p>
<p>The great prize was freedom.</p>
<p>And Ralph Gomery of the Sloan Foundation,</p>
<p>previously of IBM research pointed it out.</p>
<p>He says, if you lose freedom,</p>
<p>you lose the only thing we had to offer top minds.</p>
<p>Top minds value their intellectual freedom</p>
<p>and their physical and economic security</p>
<p>at a different level than other human beings.</p>
<p>And so people say, you know,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t understand, dude,</p>
<p>and you have the ability to do X, Y, and Z.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the problem?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, well, I value my ability</p>
<p>to raise the middle finger as an American,</p>
<p>practically above everything else.</p>
<p>I want to talk to you about freedom here</p>
<p>in the context of something you&rsquo;ve mentioned,</p>
<p>which is one way to take away freedom</p>
<p>is to put a human being into a cage</p>
<p>to create constraints.</p>
<p>The other one that worries me</p>
<p>is something that I think you&rsquo;ve spoken to</p>
<p>to Twitter a little bit on Twitter,</p>
<p>is we bleed freedom by kind of slowly</p>
<p>scaring you into not doing,</p>
<p>not expressing the full spectrum of opportunities</p>
<p>you can as freedom.</p>
<p>So like when you ban Donald Trump,</p>
<p>when you ban Parler,</p>
<p>you give a little doubt in the minds of millions,</p>
<p>like me, a person who&rsquo;s a tech person,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s an entrepreneur,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a little,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m afraid of when I look in the mirror,</p>
<p>is there now a little doubt in there</p>
<p>that limits the amount of options I will try?</p>
<p>How certain are you that the COVID virus</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t come from the Wuhan lab</p>
<p>and is biosafety level four?</p>
<p>We both know that we&rsquo;re both supposed to robotically say</p>
<p>the idea that the COVID virus came from a lab</p>
<p>is a discredited conspiracy theory.</p>
<p>There is no evidence that suggests that this is true.</p>
<p>The World Health Organization and the CDC</p>
<p>have both opined this to say otherwise</p>
<p>would be incredibly irresponsible.</p>
<p>And the threat of that is the thing</p>
<p>that ultimately limits the freedoms we feel.</p>
<p>I should be tweeting about Jeff Epstein all the time.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re afraid.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also boring.</p>
<p>I mean, I said it in the public.</p>
<p>Many times.</p>
<p>Why is it we don&rsquo;t ask where the records are</p>
<p>from Villard House?</p>
<p>Where are the financial records?</p>
<p>Where are the SEC filings?</p>
<p>Where are the questions on the record</p>
<p>to the intelligence agencies?</p>
<p>Was he known to be part of the intelligence community?</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re not interested in asking questions.</p>
<p>Like, am I gonna die as a result of asking the question,</p>
<p>was Jeff Epstein part of the intelligence community</p>
<p>of any nation?</p>
<p>Is there a reason we&rsquo;re not asking</p>
<p>about the financial records of the supposed hedge fund</p>
<p>that he didn&rsquo;t run?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like the Wuhan lab.</p>
<p>Okay, how do we get to the core of the Jeffrey Epstein,</p>
<p>the truth behind Jeffrey Epstein in a sense?</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s some things that are just like</p>
<p>useless conspiracy theories around it,</p>
<p>even if they&rsquo;re true.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some things that get to say it.</p>
<p>I hate to say it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not gonna like it.</p>
<p>Look at the 1971 media Pennsylvania break in</p>
<p>of the Citizens Committee to investigate the FBI.</p>
<p>Those kids, and by the way, they weren&rsquo;t all kids,</p>
<p>did what had to be done.</p>
<p>They broke in, they broke the law.</p>
<p>It was an incredible act of civil disobedience.</p>
<p>And God bless Judy Feingold for taking to her,</p>
<p>she was going to take to her grave,</p>
<p>that she&rsquo;d been part of this,</p>
<p>like the coolest thing of all time.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t say anything for forever.</p>
<p>So civil disobedience, I mean, you have to.</p>
<p>We are founded on civil disobedience.</p>
<p>Civil disobedience is incredibly,</p>
<p>you screw it up and you&rsquo;re just a vandal.</p>
<p>You screw it up, you&rsquo;re a hooligan.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Those cats were so disciplined.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an art form.</p>
<p>It was an art form and they risked everything.</p>
<p>They were willing to pay with their freedom.</p>
<p>Those are the sorts of people who earned the right</p>
<p>by putting themselves at risk.</p>
<p>I would not do this.</p>
<p>I am not volunteering to break into anything.</p>
<p>I think it was William Davidon who was a student</p>
<p>of Murray Gellman and a physics professor at Haverford</p>
<p>who corralled these people and led this effort.</p>
<p>And right now, what we need is somebody to blow the lid</p>
<p>off of what is controlling everything.</p>
<p>We have, I&rsquo;m happy to hear that it&rsquo;s a system</p>
<p>of incentive structures,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s a system of selective pressures.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m happy to find out that it&rsquo;s emergent.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m happy to find that it&rsquo;s partially directed</p>
<p>by our own intelligence community.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m happy to hear that, in fact, we&rsquo;ve been penetrated</p>
<p>by North Korea, Iran, China, and Russia.</p>
<p>But I need to know why people aren&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>like the firebombing of the courthouse in Portland, Oregon</p>
<p>has no explanation.</p>
<p>And somehow this is normal.</p>
<p>This is not normal to any human being.</p>
<p>We have video that people don&rsquo;t believe.</p>
<p>And I come back to the shaggy defense of it wasn&rsquo;t me.</p>
<p>You know, so it&rsquo;s like, you remember that song?</p>
<p>Shaggy, yeah, it wasn&rsquo;t me caught you banging</p>
<p>in the shower on the counter.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly, it wasn&rsquo;t me.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t me.</p>
<p>He says, but his friend says,</p>
<p>well, your strategy makes no sense at all.</p>
<p>Well, this is what MSNBC is doing.</p>
<p>You dropped it from the graphic, it wasn&rsquo;t me.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t me.</p>
<p>You came up with another Yang, it wasn&rsquo;t me.</p>
<p>I will never see MSNBC the same again.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve spoken about him before.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;d be nice to maybe honor him</p>
<p>to break it apart a little bit.</p>
<p>Aaron Schwartz.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Why was he a special human being in this ilk</p>
<p>of what we&rsquo;re talking about now, civil disobedience?</p>
<p>How do we honor him now moving forward as human beings</p>
<p>who are willing to take risks in this world?</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I mean, are you inspired by Aaron Schwartz?</p>
<p>I am.</p>
<p>How do you feel about JSTOR?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about JSTOR first.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s say what JSTOR is all about, right?</p>
<p>We the taxpayer pay for research.</p>
<p>And then the people who do the research</p>
<p>do all the work for a bunch of companies</p>
<p>who then charge us $30 an article</p>
<p>to read what it is that we already paid for.</p>
<p>And if we don&rsquo;t cite these articles,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re told that we&rsquo;re in violation.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I almost never call for civil disobedience</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t really want to, but fuck JSTOR,</p>
<p>fuck Elsevier, fuck Springer.</p>
<p>Who the fuck are these people?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Get the smart people need to take the greedy people</p>
<p>behind the woodshed and explain to them what science is.</p>
<p>I have a very old fashioned idea that&rsquo;s so out of favor</p>
<p>that I will immediately be seen as a knuckle dragger.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I believe in the great woman theory of history</p>
<p>and the great man theory of history.</p>
<p>Emmy Nerder is fantastic as an example.</p>
<p>As an example, and I believe in editors over peer reviewers.</p>
<p>And I believe that wrong things should be allowed</p>
<p>into the literature.</p>
<p>And I believe that the gatekeeping should go towards zero</p>
<p>because the costs associated with distribution</p>
<p>are very, very slight.</p>
<p>I believe that we should be looking</p>
<p>at the perverse incentives of sending your paper blindly</p>
<p>into your competitor&rsquo;s clutches,</p>
<p>particularly if you&rsquo;re a young person being reviewed</p>
<p>by an older person.</p>
<p>Are you familiar with the Duat de Senor?</p>
<p>Are you familiar with the legend of the Magnaia?</p>
<p>No, the Magnaia is the Miller&rsquo;s daughter</p>
<p>and the largest food fight in the entire universe,</p>
<p>I believe is held, I think in Italy,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s called the Battle of the Oranges.</p>
<p>And it celebrates the Miller&rsquo;s daughter</p>
<p>who had fallen in love with her beloved.</p>
<p>And when it came time for them to marry,</p>
<p>the virginal Magnaia was in fact told</p>
<p>that the Lord of the land had the right</p>
<p>to have the first night with the bride.</p>
<p>Well, the Magnaia had a different idea.</p>
<p>So she seemed to consent to this perhaps mythical right,</p>
<p>also called the Prima Note, the first night.</p>
<p>And by legend, she concealed a dagger underneath her robes.</p>
<p>And when it came time for the hated Lord of the Manor</p>
<p>to extract this right, she pulled the knife out</p>
<p>and killed him.</p>
<p>And I think it also echoes a little bit</p>
<p>of particularly wonderful scene from Game of Thrones.</p>
<p>But that inspired both men and women.</p>
<p>And the Magnaia is the legendary hero.</p>
<p>So right now, what we need to do is we need</p>
<p>to resist the Prima Note, the right of first look, right?</p>
<p>F you, you don&rsquo;t have the right of first look.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna send something blindly to my competitors.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna subject myself to you naming</p>
<p>what work I&rsquo;ve done.</p>
<p>Why are you in my story?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my question, get out of my story.</p>
<p>If I do work and then you have an idea,</p>
<p>oh, well, it&rsquo;s the Matthew principle.</p>
<p>To him who has much more will be given.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve gone to the National Academy of Sciences</p>
<p>and talked about these things.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s funny, I&rsquo;ve been laughed at by the older people</p>
<p>who think, well, Eric, you know science proceeds</p>
<p>funeral by funeral, that&rsquo;s Planck.</p>
<p>You know the Matthew principle,</p>
<p>you know the Matilda principle,</p>
<p>the things done by women are attributed to men.</p>
<p>That these are not new.</p>
<p>And you guys just live like this?</p>
<p>Yeah, so the Revolutionary Act now is to resist</p>
<p>all of these things that are not new.</p>
<p>So you asked me about Aaron Schwartz.</p>
<p>Aaron Schwartz was the Magnaia.</p>
<p>One of the things you&rsquo;ve done very beautifully</p>
<p>is to communicate love.</p>
<p>And I think about some of our conversations.</p>
<p>And you got me to talk a little bit about</p>
<p>my own experiences in 02138 and 39.</p>
<p>We are the product of our trauma.</p>
<p>And what people don&rsquo;t understand is that very often</p>
<p>when you see people taking countermeasures</p>
<p>against what appear to be imaginary forces,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re really actually replaying things</p>
<p>that really happened to them.</p>
<p>And having been through this system and watching</p>
<p>all of the ways in which it completely rewrites</p>
<p>the lives of the people who I am counting on</p>
<p>to cure our diseases, build our new industries,</p>
<p>keep us safe from our foes,</p>
<p>the amount of pressure the system is putting</p>
<p>on the most hopeful minds is unimaginable.</p>
<p>And so my goal is to empower somebody</p>
<p>like an Aaron Schwartz in memory</p>
<p>and to talk about a Jeffrey Epstein situation.</p>
<p>Do you know that the first person outside of me</p>
<p>to get a look at geometric unity was Jeffrey Epstein?</p>
<p>How did he know I was working on this?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>So your ideas that formed geometric unity</p>
<p>was something that his eyes have seen?</p>
<p>I was pushed to talk to Jeffrey Epstein</p>
<p>as one of the only people who could help me.</p>
<p>No, no, no, listen to this.</p>
<p>Yeah, how does this connect?</p>
<p>Okay, well, first of all, my old synagogue,</p>
<p>my old shul was the conservative minion at Harvard Hillel.</p>
<p>And I believe it&rsquo;s called Rosovsky Hall</p>
<p>after Henry Rosovsky in the economics department,</p>
<p>who was a Japan scholar, if I&rsquo;m correct.</p>
<p>And he became provost or dean of Harvard.</p>
<p>I believe that that was built with Jeffrey Epstein&rsquo;s money.</p>
<p>And I wondered in part whether the Jewish students</p>
<p>at Harvard all sort of passed through a bottleneck</p>
<p>of Harvard Hillel.</p>
<p>So that was something I found very curious,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t know much about it.</p>
<p>I also found that Jeffrey Epstein hanging around</p>
<p>scientists, I don&rsquo;t think that either you or Joe exactly,</p>
<p>I mean, got me correct in your last interchange.</p>
<p>For the record, for people who haven&rsquo;t listened</p>
<p>to Joe Rogan program, Joe has claimed that Eric Weinstein</p>
<p>was the only person who has gotten laid.</p>
<p>Paid.</p>
<p>Oh, paid.</p>
<p>And you said you also got paid as a young man, right?</p>
<p>I believe the word was laid, but allegedly.</p>
<p>My hearing isn&rsquo;t so good at age 55.</p>
<p>All right, leaving that aside.</p>
<p>Leaving that aside, what was Jeffrey Epstein doing</p>
<p>hanging around all of these scientists?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that was the same program</p>
<p>that was about compromising political leaders</p>
<p>and business people and entertainment figures.</p>
<p>I think these are two different programs</p>
<p>that were being run through one individual.</p>
<p>And Joe seemed to think that I didn&rsquo;t think he was smooth.</p>
<p>I thought he was glib.</p>
<p>I think what Joe is really trying to get at is that</p>
<p>I found his mysticism meretricious.</p>
<p>He had an ability to deflect every conversation</p>
<p>that might go towards revealing</p>
<p>that he didn&rsquo;t know what he was talking about.</p>
<p>Every time you started to get close to something</p>
<p>where the rubber hit the road,</p>
<p>the rubber wouldn&rsquo;t hit the road.</p>
<p>And yet, can you help me untangle the fact</p>
<p>that you thought deeply about the physics</p>
<p>of the nature of our universe</p>
<p>and Jeffrey Epstein was interested?</p>
<p>How did he know?</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t really talking about this stuff until,</p>
<p>even my close friends didn&rsquo;t really know what I was up to.</p>
<p>And yet you&rsquo;re saying he did not have</p>
<p>sufficient brilliance to understand</p>
<p>when the rubber hit the road.</p>
<p>So why did he have sufficient interest and curiosity?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you what I thought.</p>
<p>I had been waiting to find out,</p>
<p>does my government even know I exist?</p>
<p>Do you have an answer to that question?</p>
<p>I have, a couple times the government</p>
<p>has reached out to me.</p>
<p>In general, there is zero interest in me,</p>
<p>like less than zero interest.</p>
<p>I find that fascinating.</p>
<p>As far as you know, right?</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m trying to say.</p>
<p>The question about not being able to see</p>
<p>through a half silvered mirror,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s going on</p>
<p>behind the half silvered mirror.</p>
<p>To you, it&rsquo;s all you see is your reflection.</p>
<p>But your intuition still holds,</p>
<p>like this is where I&rsquo;ve mentioned that I,</p>
<p>this is where I&rsquo;ll say naive dumb things,</p>
<p>but I still hold on to this intuition that Jeff,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not confident in this,</p>
<p>but I lean towards that direction</p>
<p>that Jeffrey Epstein is the source of evil,</p>
<p>not something that&rsquo;s underlying him.</p>
<p>You have a bias.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s different than mine.</p>
<p>Our Bayesian priors are tutored</p>
<p>by different life experiences.</p>
<p>If I was mostly concerned, like Sam Harris is concerned,</p>
<p>that people fill their heads with nonsense,</p>
<p>I would have a very strong sense</p>
<p>that people need order in the world,</p>
<p>that they take mysterious situations,</p>
<p>they build entire castles in the air,</p>
<p>and then they go move in if they really get crazy.</p>
<p>The old saying is that neurotics build castles in the air</p>
<p>and psychotics move in.</p>
<p>Coming from a progressive family,</p>
<p>we had a different experience.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really weird when the government</p>
<p>is actually out to get you,</p>
<p>when they actually send a spy,</p>
<p>when they actually engage in disinformation campaigns,</p>
<p>when they smear you.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;ve ever had that brought to bear on your family,</p>
<p>you have a Howard Zinn sort of understanding of the country,</p>
<p>which is different than having a,</p>
<p>wow, do people believe crazy stuff</p>
<p>because they watch too much TV.</p>
<p>And both of these things have some merit to them,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a question of regulated expression.</p>
<p>When do you want to express more Sam Harris</p>
<p>and when do you want to express more Howard Zinn?</p>
<p>And you can express both, correct?</p>
<p>The one human being can express both?</p>
<p>Sure, but there&rsquo;s a trade off between them.</p>
<p>In other words, most people like the Michael Shermers</p>
<p>of the world are gonna tilt very strongly</p>
<p>to extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re gonna have that kind of energy.</p>
<p>And then somebody else is gonna say,</p>
<p>how many times do I have to get hit on,</p>
<p>how many times do I have to hammer my own thumb</p>
<p>before I realize that there&rsquo;s a problem?</p>
<p>So my feeling about this is yes,</p>
<p>people see patterns in clouds.</p>
<p>They see faces and scripture and all sorts of things,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just random cloud patterns.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s also the case that there&rsquo;s tremendous pressure</p>
<p>not to see conspiracies when conspiracies</p>
<p>are relatively more common than the people</p>
<p>who shout conspiracy theory will claim.</p>
<p>So both of these things are true.</p>
<p>And you have to ask, when do you express your inner Zinn</p>
<p>and when your inner Harris?</p>
<p>And those are different.</p>
<p>I want to find them out.</p>
<p>The difference in you and I biases aside</p>
<p>is you&rsquo;ve actually met Jeffrey Epstein.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m listening to reverberations years later</p>
<p>of stories and narratives throughout the story.</p>
<p>Luckily, I only met him once.</p>
<p>And I think I had one or perhaps two phone conversations</p>
<p>with him other than the one meeting.</p>
<p>You can learn a lot in just a few words, right,</p>
<p>from a human being.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s true, but I think that the bigger issue</p>
<p>was I saw something that I don&rsquo;t hear much remarked upon,</p>
<p>which is Jeffrey Epstein is all that there is.</p>
<p>In other words, there&rsquo;s the National Science Foundation,</p>
<p>National Institute of Health, Howard Hughes.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s all this stuff that kind of has the same feel to it,</p>
<p>a little bit of variation and difference,</p>
<p>Department of Energy.</p>
<p>If you fall outside of that, there&rsquo;s just Jeffrey Epstein.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re told.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not quite true.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s Kavli, maybe Jim Simons is now in the game.</p>
<p>Peter Thiel has done some stuff.</p>
<p>You had Yuri Milner and Mark Zuckerberg try.</p>
<p>So there is other money running around, Templeton.</p>
<p>But very strongly, there was a belief</p>
<p>that if you&rsquo;re doing something really innovative</p>
<p>and the system can&rsquo;t fund it because we become pussies,</p>
<p>Jeffrey Epstein&rsquo;s your guy.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s like this funnel</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re supposed to go through.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>And the idea is that you get called</p>
<p>the great man&rsquo;s house and the sort of lubricious version</p>
<p>of Ralph Lauren takes you in and asks you bizarre questions.</p>
<p>And maybe he has an island, maybe he has a plane.</p>
<p>And when you&rsquo;re starved, somebody showing you a feast</p>
<p>or when you&rsquo;re dehydrated in a death&rsquo;s door</p>
<p>and somebody says, oh, I have a well, that&rsquo;s what it is.</p>
<p>And so the thought is, wow, can somebody get some effing</p>
<p>money into the science system so that we don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>super creeps trying to learn all of our secrets</p>
<p>ahead of time?</p>
<p>WTF, what is your problem with transparency</p>
<p>and taxpayer dollars?</p>
<p>Just all of you, you wouldn&rsquo;t have a country.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d be speaking German.</p>
<p>So essentially you believe that human beings</p>
<p>would not be able to, when the money is lacking</p>
<p>in the system, like in research.</p>
<p>We produce public goods.</p>
<p>You and I are meant to produce public goods.</p>
<p>Now I sell Athletic Greens and I sell Theragun</p>
<p>and I sell Unagi scooters and Chili Pad.</p>
<p>Can I be honest, I love these products,</p>
<p>but I didn&rsquo;t get into this game for the purpose of selling.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to figure out how do you have an FU lifestyle?</p>
<p>But you know something Lex, I don&rsquo;t know why you built</p>
<p>this channel, it&rsquo;s kind of a mystery.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you why I built my channel.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna be a lot harder to roll me this time in an alley.</p>
<p>I got rolled multiple times and my point is I didn&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>to become a celebrity, I didn&rsquo;t want to become well known,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a lot harder to roll somebody who&rsquo;s getting,</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;m, I don&rsquo;t know if this is mistaken,</p>
<p>but I think I&rsquo;m the math PhD with the largest number</p>
<p>of followers on Twitter.</p>
<p>And there was nothing you could do before.</p>
<p>I mean again, to put a little responsibility on you,</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;ve created something really special</p>
<p>for the distribution of your own ideas.</p>
<p>I mean, but because it&rsquo;s not necessarily currently scalable,</p>
<p>you also, perhaps you and I have the responsibility</p>
<p>of giving other people also a chance to spread their ideas.</p>
<p>I mean Joe Rogan did this very effectively</p>
<p>for a bunch of people that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re angry at him because he&rsquo;s a gatekeeper</p>
<p>and he let all sorts of people through that gate</p>
<p>from Roger Penrose to Alex Jones.</p>
<p>To Jordan Peterson to, I mean, even first of all, to you.</p>
<p>To Abby Martin.</p>
<p>To Barry Weiss.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the problem.</p>
<p>Well, but you have not successfully built up a thing</p>
<p>that allows that to carry that forward.</p>
<p>Oh no, no, no, no.</p>
<p>We are all vulnerable to reputational attack</p>
<p>because what happens, you see, the problem, Lex,</p>
<p>is that you are now an institution at some level.</p>
<p>You walk around with all this equipment in a duffel bag.</p>
<p>The last suit you&rsquo;ll ever need.</p>
<p>And you have the reach of something like CNN</p>
<p>to people who matter.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So now the question is, how do we control something</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t have a board, doesn&rsquo;t have shareholders,</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t have to make SEC filings, FCC.</p>
<p>So the best answer they have is,</p>
<p>well, we just have to destroy reputations.</p>
<p>All it takes is for us to take something</p>
<p>that gets said or done or alleged.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s incredibly important.</p>
<p>One of the things people don&rsquo;t understand is that</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to fight general reputational attacks.</p>
<p>Not because some people don&rsquo;t deserve</p>
<p>to have their reputations dragged through the mud,</p>
<p>but because it&rsquo;s too powerful of a tool</p>
<p>to hand it to CNN, MSNBC, Princeton, Harvard,</p>
<p>the State Department.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>But some of it is also.</p>
<p>J.P. Morgan.</p>
<p>Muhammad Ali style, being good enough at</p>
<p>doing everything you need to do</p>
<p>without giving enough meat for the reputational attacks.</p>
<p>Not being afraid, but not giving enough meat.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see why the people who have good ideas</p>
<p>have to lead lives that are that clean.</p>
<p>If you can do it.</p>
<p>You can be messy, yeah.</p>
<p>You should be able to be messy.</p>
<p>Otherwise, we&rsquo;re suppressing too many people.</p>
<p>Too many, too brilliant minds.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Can you believe Elon Musk smoked a blunt?</p>
<p>I still, people tell me this.</p>
<p>Okay, I have discussions about Elon and people,</p>
<p>the Avi Loeb, the Harvard scientist,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s talking about a Muammuah</p>
<p>that it might be alien technology.</p>
<p>He told me his, this outside the box thinker.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>When speaking to me about Elon said,</p>
<p>called him the guy who smoked, he smokes weed.</p>
<p>The blunt.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>In a dismissive way.</p>
<p>Like this guy&rsquo;s crazy because he smoked some weed.</p>
<p>I was looking at him.</p>
<p>I was like, why?</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>I think you should be able to have</p>
<p>consensual drug filled orgies.</p>
<p>Fuck perfect lives.</p>
<p>Yeah, you should be allowed to be messy.</p>
<p>Yeah, right.</p>
<p>I take back my statement.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just saying.</p>
<p>Respectability is the unique prison</p>
<p>where all of the gates are open</p>
<p>and the inmates beg to stay inside.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s time to end their prison of respectability</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s too effective of a means of sidelining</p>
<p>and silencing people.</p>
<p>Including it is better that we have bad people</p>
<p>in our system than this idea of no platforming people</p>
<p>who are beyond the pale because it&rsquo;s such a simple technique.</p>
<p>So how do we, what&rsquo;s the heroic action here on the?</p>
<p>Well, for example, having Ashley Matthews on my program.</p>
<p>By the way, she was absolutely delightful as a guest.</p>
<p>She was, she is polite in the extreme,</p>
<p>far more polite than I am.</p>
<p>And I had her right after Roger Penrose as a guest</p>
<p>because I wanted to highlight this program can go anywhere.</p>
<p>We can talk to anyone.</p>
<p>What about social media?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve started highlighting people being banned</p>
<p>on social media.</p>
<p>How do we fight this?</p>
<p>Like if you get banned from social media,</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re saying nobody will stand up to me.</p>
<p>Well, just figure out what your incentive structure</p>
<p>is before.</p>
<p>Assume that I get banned on social media</p>
<p>because somebody wants to make sure</p>
<p>that my message doesn&rsquo;t interfere</p>
<p>with the dominant narrative.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>What will happen, by the way,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very glad to be able to explain this on your show</p>
<p>because that video will presumably be archived</p>
<p>and they can&rsquo;t easily make you take it down.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s gonna happen is,</p>
<p>is that there&rsquo;ll be a whole bunch</p>
<p>of very low quality bot like accounts</p>
<p>that dog you every time you talk about me.</p>
<p>Right, dude, it&rsquo;s getting old, getting boring.</p>
<p>We already heard you.</p>
<p>Dude, that was like, let it go.</p>
<p>Not a good look.</p>
<p>Not a good look is one of my favorites.</p>
<p>But what about the high profile ones?</p>
<p>Well, then you&rsquo;ll get a few high profile ones</p>
<p>and some of the high profile ones command armies.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Like at some point I had 10,000 people</p>
<p>using exactly the same templated tweet, tweeting at me.</p>
<p>It was just actually, it got to the point</p>
<p>where it was funny because everybody said,</p>
<p>did you hear that in a hipster coffee shop?</p>
<p>And I was like,</p>
<p>why are you all suddenly talking about hipster coffee?</p>
<p>Just hilarious.</p>
<p>Those things will cause you to think better of it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll start to see your follower count go down</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s easy to give you a bunch of bot like follows</p>
<p>and then just pull them.</p>
<p>So I think that&rsquo;s pretty well known how,</p>
<p>and then maybe your account will be suspended</p>
<p>and it can&rsquo;t be revoked and et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p>And then three days later, you&rsquo;ll be told it was an error.</p>
<p>So let me push back.</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t see not defending you.</p>
<p>Like, okay, so what are the things you would do</p>
<p>that given that I can actually talk to you offline,</p>
<p>that would make me not defend you?</p>
<p>Well, first of all, I can&rsquo;t, I mean, I can imagine some,</p>
<p>but all of us have things.</p>
<p>If somebody says, do you hear what your boy,</p>
<p>Lex said about you?</p>
<p>What did Lex say about me?</p>
<p>Oh, he said you were flawed, dude.</p>
<p>Oh, shit.</p>
<p>They so distressed</p>
<p>because none of us wanna stand behind flawed people.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why you have everybody rushing to say,</p>
<p>I neither condemn nor condone.</p>
<p>I know I don&rsquo;t condemn nor, what is that?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re all trying to say.</p>
<p>By the way, for the record,</p>
<p>I said that Eric is smarter than me</p>
<p>in a brilliant human being, but flawed like all humans are.</p>
<p>My point is I&rsquo;ve now come up with a new policy,</p>
<p>which is I don&rsquo;t care what my friends have done.</p>
<p>I am not disavowing my friends,</p>
<p>not because they didn&rsquo;t do the wrong thing.</p>
<p>Maybe they did do the wrong thing.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the value of friendship if that&rsquo;s not that?</p>
<p>Like, for example, we&rsquo;ve had the situation</p>
<p>with Brian Callan.</p>
<p>Brian Callan was featured recently in the Los Angeles Times.</p>
<p>I know nothing about the allegations.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t, I didn&rsquo;t even know Brian at the time, right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve known him for roughly the time I&rsquo;ve been in Los Angeles,</p>
<p>maybe a year and a half during that period of time.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never seen anything wrong.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m in a situation, well, what do you think he did?</p>
<p>Do you think he didn&rsquo;t?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, you know what?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, but I do know this.</p>
<p>Everyone&rsquo;s entitled to have friends</p>
<p>because we can&rsquo;t afford isolated people.</p>
<p>And if your friends do the wrong thing,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re still your friends.</p>
<p>And if they do terrible, terrible things,</p>
<p>you bring that up with them privately.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not my responsibility to disavow in public.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve had the situation that I don&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>where particular people that I&rsquo;ve been close to,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m put under tremendous pressure to disavow them.</p>
<p>What do you think now about your buddy?</p>
<p>I like Dave Rubin, all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the thing, my friends are my friends.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t disavow my friends.</p>
<p>We all need to make a statement</p>
<p>that we will not be brought under pressure</p>
<p>to disavow our friends, our family members,</p>
<p>because mass murderers are dangerous</p>
<p>the more isolated they become.</p>
<p>It is not a good idea to constantly push to isolate people.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s dangerous, and so.</p>
<p>And it sends a signal to everybody else</p>
<p>to fit in, to be more cynical about the human.</p>
<p>So my feeling, if I find out you&rsquo;ve been selling heroin</p>
<p>to elementary school students,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re still my friend, and I will not be disavowing you.</p>
<p>And if I have a problem with you selling heroin</p>
<p>to elementary school students during school hours,</p>
<p>I will bring it up with you privately,</p>
<p>because we don&rsquo;t need to hear my voice</p>
<p>added to that condemnation.</p>
<p>Are there things that you could do</p>
<p>that would cause me to say, actually, F this guy?</p>
<p>Yeah, above and beyond that.</p>
<p>But simply doing the wrong thing,</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;ve gone down a terrible path.</p>
<p>I think isolated people are about the most dangerous thing</p>
<p>we could have in a heavily armed society.</p>
<p>So I deeply agree with you on Brian Callan</p>
<p>and on all these people that, quote, unquote, got canceled.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not saying that they,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know the truth value, because we can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And even if I did know the truth value,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not setting up an incentive structure</p>
<p>for the personal destruction</p>
<p>as a means of letting institutions combat</p>
<p>the fact that individuals are the last thing that can say,</p>
<p>none of you guys make any sense.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t treat these things like,</p>
<p>I had a conversation where Kevin Spacey</p>
<p>was at the dinner table when I came down from a hotel room.</p>
<p>And I had a very long conversation with Kevin Spacey.</p>
<p>I will not detail, because I don&rsquo;t do that,</p>
<p>as to what we discussed.</p>
<p>But we talked very specifically about him being canceled.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think that the world has heard that story</p>
<p>in part because there&rsquo;s a very strong sense</p>
<p>that he has to be outgrouped.</p>
<p>And as a result, I mean, do we want,</p>
<p>do we want to disavow the space program</p>
<p>because it touched Werner von Braun?</p>
<p>Do we want to disavow quantum mechanics</p>
<p>because Pascal Jordan and Werner Heisenberg passed through it?</p>
<p>Is Ehrenfest&rsquo;s theorem false because he murdered his child?</p>
<p>I mean, at what point do we recognize</p>
<p>that we are the problem?</p>
<p>Humans are humans.</p>
<p>And there is no perfect,</p>
<p>there is no perfect group of people,</p>
<p>even all of the most oppressed people,</p>
<p>the supposed victims of the world,</p>
<p>who we now have fetishized into thinking</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re all oracles</p>
<p>because their lived experience informs us</p>
<p>and their pain is more salient than everyone else&rsquo;s pain.</p>
<p>Those people aren&rsquo;t necessarily great people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like none of us, we can&rsquo;t do this in this fashion.</p>
<p>So when we sit down to have a conversation</p>
<p>across the table from somebody,</p>
<p>you should be willing to,</p>
<p>like you should not have NPR in your mind.</p>
<p>You should be willing to take the full risk</p>
<p>and to see the good in the person</p>
<p>with limited information</p>
<p>and to do your best to understand that person.</p>
<p>Everybody is entitled to a hypocrisy budget.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe this is of institutions, okay?</p>
<p>Everybody is entitled</p>
<p>to a certain amount of screwing up in life.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re entitled to a mendacity budget.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re entitled to an aggression budget.</p>
<p>The idea of getting rid of everybody,</p>
<p>you know, people haven&rsquo;t even blown through their budgets</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re already.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think about, for example, one person,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be curious to get your thoughts about Alex Jones.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s not talk about Alex Jones for a second.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about the National Enquirer.</p>
<p>Is everything the National Enquirer says false?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Okay, do you remember the John Edwards story?</p>
<p>Did you cheat on his wife?</p>
<p>Sorry.</p>
<p>He had a child from an extramarital affair.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I believe that the National Enquirer broke the story.</p>
<p>And then what does the New York Times do?</p>
<p>The New York Times, I think, is allowed to report</p>
<p>that the National Enquirer is making a claim.</p>
<p>That way they don&rsquo;t have to substantiate the story.</p>
<p>So why is the New York Times talking to Mike Cernovich</p>
<p>or using the National Enquirer as a source?</p>
<p>Are they using Alex Jones as a source?</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the big problem that we&rsquo;re having.</p>
<p>Why are certain people entitled to talk to everybody</p>
<p>and other people are entitled to talk to no one?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really understand this.</p>
<p>This is an indulgence system.</p>
<p>This is how the Catholic church used to do things.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to fight the system because the reason</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t talk to Alex Jones is because the platforms</p>
<p>on which we do the communication will deplatform.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not platform.</p>
<p>I used to do NPR and I used to do the NewsHour</p>
<p>and I used to provide stories</p>
<p>to Washington Post, New York Times.</p>
<p>That has gone away.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve circled the wagons closer and closer</p>
<p>and more of us are unacceptable.</p>
<p>And right now I have no question that they&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>through anybody who has a platform trying to say,</p>
<p>okay, what do we have against that person</p>
<p>in case we need to shut that down?</p>
<p>We have to make a different decision, Lex,</p>
<p>and the different decision is that it doesn&rsquo;t matter</p>
<p>how many times Joe said the N word.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter that somebody else,</p>
<p>with mathematical theorems, if the worst person</p>
<p>in the world proves a mathematical theorem</p>
<p>like the Unabomber, we can&rsquo;t undo the theorem.</p>
<p>And I point out Charles Manson&rsquo;s song,</p>
<p>Look at Your Game Girl is an amazing song.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a really good song.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s one of the greatest songs ever,</p>
<p>but it happens that he wasn&rsquo;t a no talent.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know how Hitler was as an artist.</p>
<p>Fiction, not bad.</p>
<p>Okay, we&rsquo;ve got to get past this.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got to get past this idea</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re going to purge ourselves of our badness</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re just going to, this is like,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve likened it to teenage girls in cutting.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re just, all we&rsquo;re doing is destroying ourselves</p>
<p>in search of perfection.</p>
<p>And the answer is no, we&rsquo;re not perfect.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re flawed, we&rsquo;re screwed up.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve always been this way.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re not going to silence everyone</p>
<p>who you can point a laser beam at</p>
<p>and say, well, that person, look at how bad that person is.</p>
<p>If we do that, kiss the whole thing goodbye.</p>
<p>We might as well just, let&rsquo;s learn Chinese.</p>
<p>But there is an art to having those messy conversations,</p>
<p>whether with Alex or anybody else.</p>
<p>Okay, let&rsquo;s talk about Alex.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s particular stuff that Alex does</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s absolutely nauseating.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s other stuff that he&rsquo;s doing that&rsquo;s funny.</p>
<p>The methodology of the way he carries.</p>
<p>And sometimes he&rsquo;s talking about the truth.</p>
<p>And sometimes he&rsquo;s talking about a conspiracy.</p>
<p>His variance is incredibly high.</p>
<p>The right way to approach Alex Jones or James O. Keefe</p>
<p>or the National Enquirer or anything you don&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>is to say, great, go long short.</p>
<p>Well, if you invest in a mutual fund,</p>
<p>all the stocks in the mutual fund are held long.</p>
<p>But if you invest in a hedge fund,</p>
<p>you do something called relative value trade.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, well, you long tech or short tech?</p>
<p>Well, actually I&rsquo;m long Microsoft and I&rsquo;m short Google.</p>
<p>Why is that?</p>
<p>Oh, because I believe Google got way too much attention</p>
<p>and that Microsoft has been unfairly maligned.</p>
<p>And so this is really a play on legacy tech</p>
<p>over more modern tech, okay?</p>
<p>Which part of Alex Jones are you long</p>
<p>and which part are you short?</p>
<p>One of the things that should be a requirement</p>
<p>for being a reporter is like,</p>
<p>what did Donald Trump do that was good?</p>
<p>Right. Nothing.</p>
<p>Okay, then you&rsquo;re not a reporter.</p>
<p>What did Hitler do that was good?</p>
<p>The Rosenstrasse of protest.</p>
<p>Non Jewish women campaign for their Jewish men</p>
<p>to be returned home to them</p>
<p>from certain death almost in death camps.</p>
<p>It should have been that there were no death camps.</p>
<p>It should have been that everybody was returned home.</p>
<p>But you know what?</p>
<p>The fact that the women of the Rosenstrasse protest,</p>
<p>I mean, sorry, I get very emotional about this.</p>
<p>Some of the baddest ass chicks in the world</p>
<p>got their husbands returned to them.</p>
<p>Kolokavod.</p>
<p>And not, I&rsquo;m not celebrating Hitler.</p>
<p>Hitler&rsquo;s the worst of the worst.</p>
<p>But God damn it, this idea that we can just say</p>
<p>everything that person does is a lie.</p>
<p>Everything that person does is evil.</p>
<p>This reflects a simplicity of mind</p>
<p>that humanity cannot afford.</p>
<p>Is Google evil because it will sell you Mein Kampf?</p>
<p>Is Amazon evil because it will sell you Mein Kampf?</p>
<p>If you find out that Mein Kampf</p>
<p>rests on somebody&rsquo;s bookshelves,</p>
<p>do you have any idea what it means?</p>
<p>If you find out that a scholar use the N word,</p>
<p>should that person lose their job?</p>
<p>Come on.</p>
<p>Grow the hell up.</p>
<p>I guess our responsibility to lead by example in that,</p>
<p>because you have to acknowledge that the fact,</p>
<p>like the current public discourse.</p>
<p>Have somebody on your podcast who you&rsquo;re worried about.</p>
<p>But do it in a principled fashion.</p>
<p>I mean, in other words, I&rsquo;m not here to whitewash everything.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if somebody makes some allegations,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know that I&rsquo;m obligated</p>
<p>to treat every set of allegations as if,</p>
<p>no, how do you defend yourself against, no.</p>
<p>Allegations are so cheap to make at this moment.</p>
<p>Well, my standard, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>maybe you could speak to it is,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care, like in the case of Alex Jones, for example,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;m willing to have a conversation</p>
<p>with Alex Jones and people like him.</p>
<p>If I know he&rsquo;s not going to try to manipulate me.</p>
<p>Assume that he is gonna try to manipulate you.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t, then we&rsquo;re not going to be two humans.</p>
<p>Okay, but Lex, I want you to think well of me.</p>
<p>I put on a jacket, I don&rsquo;t usually wear a jacket, okay?</p>
<p>Thank you, Eric.</p>
<p>All right, I&rsquo;m trying to manipulate you.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an entire field, no, there&rsquo;s an entire field</p>
<p>that says that speech may be best thought of</p>
<p>as an attempt to manipulate each other.</p>
<p>This is too simplistic.</p>
<p>Everything that we keep talking through.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>You know better than this.</p>
<p>I disagree, I think there is ways,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s, of course, it&rsquo;s a gray area,</p>
<p>but there is a threshold where your intent</p>
<p>with which you come to a meeting, to an interaction,</p>
<p>is one that is not one that&rsquo;s grounded</p>
<p>in like a respect for a common humanity,</p>
<p>like a love for each other, is deeply messy.</p>
<p>If somebody is doing really bad stuff,</p>
<p>I expect you to try to keep them</p>
<p>from doing really bad stuff.</p>
<p>But just keep in mind that when I was a younger man,</p>
<p>I saw an amazing anti pornography documentary,</p>
<p>and it was called Rate It X,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t know where it went,</p>
<p>but the conceit of it was we&rsquo;re going to get</p>
<p>some pornographers in front of a camera</p>
<p>because they want to talk,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re going to ask them about what they do</p>
<p>for a living and why it&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>No commentary.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>You could potentially,</p>
<p>if you really think Alex Jones is the worst,</p>
<p>and again, I&rsquo;m not intimately familiar with him,</p>
<p>you could decide to just let him talk.</p>
<p>Just let him talk.</p>
<p>Now, I have decided not to do that with particular people.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve spoken to Stefan Molyneux.</p>
<p>Stefan Molyneux makes many good points,</p>
<p>makes many bad points,</p>
<p>and he makes many good points in bad ways,</p>
<p>and I worry about it,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t feel that it&rsquo;s not my obligation</p>
<p>to make sure that Stefan Molyneux</p>
<p>has a voice on the portal.</p>
<p>But I did stand up and say I didn&rsquo;t want him banned</p>
<p>from social media,</p>
<p>and I do think that a lot of the people</p>
<p>who are being banned from social media</p>
<p>were worried that they&rsquo;re right</p>
<p>rather than that they&rsquo;re wrong.</p>
<p>I certainly don&rsquo;t really think that I&rsquo;m worried</p>
<p>in some sense that some of the really wrong people</p>
<p>are wrong, but if you look at, for example, Curtis Yarvin,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a tremendous amount of interest.</p>
<p>Is Eric going to speak to Curtis Yarvin?</p>
<p>Curtis Yarvin says many interesting things,</p>
<p>and he says many horrible, stupid things, very provocative.</p>
<p>And I haven&rsquo;t invited him onto the portal,</p>
<p>but I haven&rsquo;t said I will never invite him onto the portal.</p>
<p>We are all in a difficult position.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m saying.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re making it kind of,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a much more difficult task</p>
<p>and burden to carry as people who have conversations</p>
<p>because Curtis Yarvin is a good example.</p>
<p>How much work do I have to put in reading Curtis&rsquo;s work</p>
<p>to really understand?</p>
<p>We should talk about the problem of Curtis Yarvin,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s probably illustrative.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s this big question is why does somebody</p>
<p>who says such stupid ass things listen to</p>
<p>by so many people?</p>
<p>Very smart people, people who are part of our daily lives</p>
<p>discuss Curtis Yarvin in hushed tones.</p>
<p>Now, it&rsquo;s a good question.</p>
<p>My belief is that Curtis Yarvin has made a number</p>
<p>of very interesting, provocative points,</p>
<p>and they associate Curtis Yarvin as the person</p>
<p>who has made these points,</p>
<p>and they treat the completely asinine stuff</p>
<p>that he says that&rsquo;s super dangerous as,</p>
<p>well, that&rsquo;s Curtis, right?</p>
<p>Right, they give him the credit for,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a kind of like, sorry to use the term,</p>
<p>first principles deep thinker about the way the world,</p>
<p>in some space about the world.</p>
<p>But as a result, we don&rsquo;t actually know</p>
<p>why Curtis Yarvin is knocking around</p>
<p>so many Silicon Valley luminaries lives.</p>
<p>See, you said that he said a lot of asinine stupid stuff,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s the sense I got from a few things I&rsquo;ve read,</p>
<p>not just about, this is not just like Wikipedia stuff,</p>
<p>is he&rsquo;s a little, like I&rsquo;ve said before,</p>
<p>he seems to be careless.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s, no, no, no, it&rsquo;s like Jim Watson.</p>
<p>Jim Watson wants to say very provocative things</p>
<p>in order to prove that he&rsquo;s free.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a question of careless.</p>
<p>He enjoys the freedom to say these things.</p>
<p>And the key point is, is that there&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>I expect something more of Curtis.</p>
<p>I expect that if somebody is insightful</p>
<p>about all sorts of things up to that point,</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re going to have enough care.</p>
<p>Now, I, for example, make this point repeatedly</p>
<p>that vaccines are not 100% safe.</p>
<p>Most people who have an idea that anybody</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s an anti vaxxer should be silenced are in a position</p>
<p>where they probably don&rsquo;t say vaccines are 100% safe,</p>
<p>but you keep finding that statement over and over again,</p>
<p>like believe all women, vaccines are 100% safe,</p>
<p>climate science is settled science.</p>
<p>Whatever this Mont and Bailey is,</p>
<p>where you make extraordinarily vapid blanket claims,</p>
<p>and then you retreat into something,</p>
<p>well, defund the, we don&rsquo;t want no more police,</p>
<p>actually just means we want the police to not take</p>
<p>on mental health duties.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve come up with an incredibly disingenuous society.</p>
<p>And what I&rsquo;m claiming is, is that I might talk</p>
<p>to Curtis Yarvin, but I have really very little interest</p>
<p>to talk to a guy who seems to be kind of giddy</p>
<p>about who makes good slaves and who makes bad slaves.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, why do I want to do that on the portal?</p>
<p>One, first of all, because just as you said,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not Curtis&rsquo;s main thing.</p>
<p>He has a lot of ideas and what I&rsquo;ve read of him,</p>
<p>which is not a huge amount, is he&rsquo;s very thoughtful</p>
<p>about the way this world works.</p>
<p>And on top of that, he&rsquo;s an important historical figure</p>
<p>in the birth and the development of the alt right,</p>
<p>or what would be called the alt right.</p>
<p>Or the new reactionary.</p>
<p>Yeah, and there&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>so he&rsquo;s just an important intellectual.</p>
<p>And so it makes sense to talk to him.</p>
<p>The question is, how much work do you put in?</p>
<p>Well, this is the issue of fugu.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a chef that necessarily can serve that fugu.</p>
<p>So you have a puffer fish, you can eat the puffer fish.</p>
<p>You can get kind of a tingly sensation on your tongue</p>
<p>if you get a little bit of the poison organ.</p>
<p>But my point is, I don&rsquo;t know how to serve Curtis Yarvin</p>
<p>so that, in fact, I&rsquo;m not worried about what happens.</p>
<p>And I believe that if somebody else was a student</p>
<p>of the new reactionary movement,</p>
<p>that person might be in a better position</p>
<p>to host Curtis Yarvin.</p>
<p>So somebody, that&rsquo;s a really good example,</p>
<p>somebody I think you&rsquo;ve spoken with that&rsquo;s an intermediary,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a powerful one, is Michael Malice.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s spoken with Curtis Yarvin.</p>
<p>And Michael wrote a book about.</p>
<p>By the way, Michael somewhat changed my mind</p>
<p>about Michael Malice.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad he did.</p>
<p>I think, I would call him a friend,</p>
<p>and I think he&rsquo;s underneath it all</p>
<p>a really kind human being.</p>
<p>And I think your skepticism about him was initially</p>
<p>from a surface level of, what did you call him,</p>
<p>hyenas, the trolls, and so on.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not happy about his.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been so long since I&rsquo;ve seen good trolls.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>He needs a higher quality of trolling.</p>
<p>But he aspires to that.</p>
<p>I mean, disagree or not,</p>
<p>I really enjoy how much care he puts</p>
<p>into the work he does, like on North Korea</p>
<p>and the study of the world,</p>
<p>and how much privately, but also in public,</p>
<p>love he has for people, especially those who are powerless.</p>
<p>Just a genuine admiration for them.</p>
<p>I think Curtis actually.</p>
<p>Does too.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I mean, you have to appreciate,</p>
<p>the first time I met Curtis, he introduced me,</p>
<p>he says, I&rsquo;m the most right wing person you&rsquo;ve ever met.</p>
<p>I was just like, well,</p>
<p>this is a conversation that&rsquo;s already over.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s theatrical in a way that&rsquo;s not conducted</p>
<p>to actually having a real human connection.</p>
<p>It turned me off because it was like,</p>
<p>you need to be the most right wing person.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s like, I&rsquo;m a troll, I&rsquo;m a troll.</p>
<p>Okay, why are we doing this?</p>
<p>But what I&rsquo;m trying to get at is different.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to say that Michael Malice is a friend of yours.</p>
<p>If you found out something terrible,</p>
<p>you should still be a friend.</p>
<p>You should still continue to be his friend.</p>
<p>And in Michael Malice&rsquo;s case,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very likely that we&rsquo;ll find out something terrible.</p>
<p>Curtis is an acquaintance of mine</p>
<p>because he hangs around with some people that I know.</p>
<p>I did not get it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve started to understand why the people in my life,</p>
<p>some of them are Curtis Yarvin fans.</p>
<p>Many of them disregard the stupid stuff.</p>
<p>But my feeling is that too much poison organ,</p>
<p>not enough fish.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how to serve that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s too intermingled.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not your chef.</p>
<p>Speaking for defending your friends,</p>
<p>staying with your friends,</p>
<p>and bringing the old band together again,</p>
<p>you coined the term IDW, Intellectual Dark Web.</p>
<p>I like it.</p>
<p>It represents a certain group of people</p>
<p>that are struggling with,</p>
<p>that are almost like challenged the norms</p>
<p>of social and political discourse</p>
<p>from all different angles.</p>
<p>What do you think is the state of the IDW?</p>
<p>What do you think is its future?</p>
<p>Is it still a useful?</p>
<p>Well, it never exists.</p>
<p>Is it a protocol?</p>
<p>Is it a collection of people featured in an article?</p>
<p>What I learned very clearly</p>
<p>is that there&rsquo;s a tremendous desire in the internet age</p>
<p>to pin people down.</p>
<p>Well, what do you say?</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s in it?</p>
<p>What are the criteria?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, I understand.</p>
<p>You wanna play the demarcation game</p>
<p>and you wanna make everything that is demarcated</p>
<p>instantly null and void.</p>
<p>No, thank you.</p>
<p>So I resisted saying who was in it.</p>
<p>I resisted saying what it was.</p>
<p>I resisted saying that Barry Weiss&rsquo;s article</p>
<p>was the definitive thing.</p>
<p>They chose a ridiculous concept for the photographs</p>
<p>that we couldn&rsquo;t get out of.</p>
<p>I did not want those photographs taken.</p>
<p>They decided that the Pulitzer Prize winning photographer</p>
<p>needed to take them all at twilight.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, some such thing.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t even necessarily wanna do the article.</p>
<p>Barry convinced me that it was the right thing to do.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly Barry was right.</p>
<p>I was wrong.</p>
<p>But the key point is nothing can grow in this environment.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a reason we&rsquo;re not building.</p>
<p>It does not appear that we found a way</p>
<p>to grow anything organic and good and decent</p>
<p>that we need right now.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s kind of the key issue.</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s the we?</p>
<p>Do you mean us as a society?</p>
<p>Those of us who wish to have a future</p>
<p>for our great grandchildren.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take the subset of people who are worried</p>
<p>about things long after their demise.</p>
<p>But do you think it&rsquo;s useful to have a term like the IDW</p>
<p>to capture some set of people,</p>
<p>some set of ideas</p>
<p>or maybe principles that capture what I think the IDW,</p>
<p>okay, you can say it&rsquo;s not supposed to mean,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t exist, it doesn&rsquo;t mean anything,</p>
<p>but to the public, to me, okay, I&rsquo;ll just speak to me,</p>
<p>it represented something.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It represented, I think I just said this to you,</p>
<p>in my first attempt to interview the great Eric Weinstein,</p>
<p>I said that, I spoke this about you,</p>
<p>but IDW in general is trying to point out the elephant</p>
<p>in the room or that the emperor has no clothes.</p>
<p>The set of people that do that in their own way.</p>
<p>If there are multiple elephants in the room,</p>
<p>the point is that the IDW was more interested</p>
<p>in seeing the totality of elephants</p>
<p>and trying to figure out how do we move forward</p>
<p>as opposed to saying I can spot the other guy&rsquo;s elephant</p>
<p>in the room, but I can&rsquo;t see my own.</p>
<p>And in large measure,</p>
<p>we didn&rsquo;t represent an institutional base.</p>
<p>And therefore it wasn&rsquo;t maximally important</p>
<p>that we look at our own hypocrisy</p>
<p>because we weren&rsquo;t on the institutional spectrum.</p>
<p>This is where friendship comes into play</p>
<p>with the different figures</p>
<p>that are loosely associated with IDW</p>
<p>is you were somehow responsible for the exact thing</p>
<p>that you said, did you hear what, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>I forget, oh, what Sam Harris said about IDW.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That kind of thing is.</p>
<p>I chuckled.</p>
<p>Lovingly or chuckle like, oh.</p>
<p>I was angry at some people who had said things</p>
<p>that caused Sam to say what Sam said</p>
<p>about turning his imaginary club membership into the IDW.</p>
<p>People said very silly things.</p>
<p>And I think that there is just this confusion</p>
<p>that integrity means calling out your friends</p>
<p>in front of the world.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve been pretty clear about this.</p>
<p>I try to choose my friends carefully.</p>
<p>And if you would like to recuse me</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m not a source of reliable information,</p>
<p>people that I know and love the most,</p>
<p>maybe that&rsquo;s reasonable for you.</p>
<p>Maybe you prefer somebody who was willing</p>
<p>to throw a friend under the bus</p>
<p>at the first sign of trouble.</p>
<p>By all means, exit my feed.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to subscribe to me.</p>
<p>If that&rsquo;s your concept of integrity,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re barking up the wrong tree.</p>
<p>What I will say is that I knew these people well enough</p>
<p>to know that they&rsquo;re all flawed.</p>
<p>Thank you for the callback.</p>
<p>But the issue is that I love people who are flawed.</p>
<p>And I love people who have to earn a living,</p>
<p>even if you call them a grifter.</p>
<p>And I love people who like the fact</p>
<p>that Donald Trump didn&rsquo;t get us into new wars,</p>
<p>even if you call them alt right.</p>
<p>I love the fact that some people believe</p>
<p>in structural oppression and wanna fight it,</p>
<p>even if they&rsquo;re not woke,</p>
<p>because they don&rsquo;t believe that structural oppression</p>
<p>is hiding everywhere.</p>
<p>I care and love different people in different ways.</p>
<p>And I think that the overarching thing, Lex,</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re not getting at is that</p>
<p>we were sold a bill of goods</p>
<p>that you can go through life like an ELISA program</p>
<p>with pre programmed responses.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s what about ism, it&rsquo;s both sides ism,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s alt right, it&rsquo;s the loony left, it&rsquo;s campus madness.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, okay, why don&rsquo;t you just empty</p>
<p>the entire goddamn magazine?</p>
<p>All of those pre recorded snips.</p>
<p>Now that you&rsquo;ve done all of that,</p>
<p>now we can have a conversation.</p>
<p>Your son put it really well, which is we should,</p>
<p>in all things, resist labels.</p>
<p>But we can&rsquo;t deal without labels, we have to generalize.</p>
<p>But we also have to keep in mind</p>
<p>that just in the way in science,</p>
<p>you deal with an effective theory</p>
<p>that isn&rsquo;t a fundamental one.</p>
<p>In science, most of our theories,</p>
<p>we consider to be effective theories.</p>
<p>If I generalize about Europe, about women,</p>
<p>about Christians, those things have to be understood</p>
<p>to mean something and not to have their definitions</p>
<p>extend so broadly that they mean nothing at all,</p>
<p>nor that they&rsquo;re so rigid that they&rsquo;re claims</p>
<p>that clearly won&rsquo;t bear scrutiny.</p>
<p>Lex, what do you really wanna talk about?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s always my question to you.</p>
<p>That always gets me, maybe you are the therapist.</p>
<p>But you and I could talk about anything.</p>
<p>People love, up until now at least,</p>
<p>people have loved listening</p>
<p>to the two of us in conversation.</p>
<p>And my feeling is is that we&rsquo;re not talking</p>
<p>about neural nets, and we&rsquo;re not talking</p>
<p>about geometric unity, and we&rsquo;re not talking</p>
<p>about where distributed computing might go.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think that we&rsquo;re really focused</p>
<p>on some of the most exciting things</p>
<p>we could do to transform education.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re still caught in this world of other people</p>
<p>that we don&rsquo;t belong in.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t belong in the world as it&rsquo;s been created.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to build a new world,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m astounded that the people</p>
<p>with the independent means to help build that world</p>
<p>are so demotivated that they don&rsquo;t wanna</p>
<p>build new structures.</p>
<p>And the people who do wanna build new structures</p>
<p>seem to be wild eyed.</p>
<p>Wild eyed, what do you mean by wild eyed?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not, they&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>I guarantee you that I will get some message</p>
<p>in my DMs that says, hey, Eric.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;m a third year chemistry student</p>
<p>at South Dakota State, and I&rsquo;ve got a great idea.</p>
<p>I just need funding.</p>
<p>I wanna build.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t have the means.</p>
<p>So the people who have the means have become.</p>
<p>Or the sophistication, it&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re looking</p>
<p>for somebody who&rsquo;s proven themselves a few times</p>
<p>to say, you know, I&rsquo;ve got $4 billion behind me</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s soft circled.</p>
<p>I wanna figure out what a new university would be</p>
<p>and what it would take to protect academic freedom</p>
<p>and who we would hire</p>
<p>and what are the different characteristics</p>
<p>because I can clearly see that everything</p>
<p>following the current model is falling apart.</p>
<p>Nobody in my understanding is saying that.</p>
<p>Nobody is saying let&rsquo;s take that</p>
<p>which is functioning independently</p>
<p>and make it less vulnerable.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s boost those signals.</p>
<p>And a critical component as money, you think?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not only that, but it&rsquo;s also a kind of</p>
<p>these people are mobbed up hands off.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s imagine for the moment that Sundar Pichai,</p>
<p>Jack Dorsey, and Mark Zuckerberg</p>
<p>founded a university come social media entity.</p>
<p>And they said, the purpose of this is to make sure</p>
<p>that academic freedom will not perish from this earth</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s necessary to keep us from all going crazy.</p>
<p>And we are going to lock ourselves out.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve come up with this governance system.</p>
<p>And the idea is that these people will be assigned</p>
<p>the difficult task of making sure that society</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t go crazy in any particular direction.</p>
<p>That we have a fact based, reality based,</p>
<p>feasibility based, understaffed,</p>
<p>theory based understanding.</p>
<p>We can try to figure out where our real opportunities are.</p>
<p>It feels like everybody with the ability</p>
<p>to do something like that,</p>
<p>and with the brains and experience and the resources,</p>
<p>would rather sit in the current system</p>
<p>and hope to figure out where they can flee to</p>
<p>if the whole thing comes apart.</p>
<p>Well, yeah, and maybe to push back in a little bit,</p>
<p>I agree with you, but you know,</p>
<p>it feels like some people are trying that.</p>
<p>So for example, Google purchased DeepMind.</p>
<p>DeepMind is a company that kind of represents</p>
<p>a lot of radical ideas.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve become acceptable, actually.</p>
<p>AGI, artificial general intelligence,</p>
<p>used to be really radical of a thing to talk about.</p>
<p>And DeepMind and OpenAI are two places</p>
<p>which has made it more acceptable.</p>
<p>I know you can now start to criticize,</p>
<p>well, they&rsquo;re really, now that it&rsquo;s become acceptable,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not taking the further step</p>
<p>of being more and more radical.</p>
<p>But you know, that wasn&rsquo;t an attempt by Google</p>
<p>to say that let&rsquo;s try some wild stuff.</p>
<p>Sort of like Boston Dynamics.</p>
<p>Boston Dynamics is a really good example</p>
<p>of trying radical ideas for perhaps no purpose whatsoever</p>
<p>except to try out their ideas.</p>
<p>Well, the idea is that innovation is like dessert.</p>
<p>You can have dessert after you solve the problem</p>
<p>of the main course, and the main course</p>
<p>is a bunch of insoluble problems.</p>
<p>So the idea is we can get into innovation</p>
<p>once we perfect ourselves.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re saying that we need to make innovation</p>
<p>the main meal.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m saying that there really is structural oppression.</p>
<p>I mean, if you train a deep learning system</p>
<p>on exclusively white faces, it&rsquo;s gonna get confused.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s not disagree that there are real issues</p>
<p>around this.</p>
<p>In fact, that&rsquo;s an issue of innovation and data.</p>
<p>Your data should be responsive.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there are things</p>
<p>we can&rsquo;t do anything about that are actually fundamental.</p>
<p>And those things may have to do with the fact</p>
<p>that some of us taste cilantro as soap,</p>
<p>and some of us don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Like there are differences between people,</p>
<p>and some of them are in the hardware,</p>
<p>some of them are in the firmware,</p>
<p>some of them are in the software that is the human mind.</p>
<p>And this completely simplistic idea</p>
<p>that every failure of an organization</p>
<p>to promote each person</p>
<p>who has particular intersexual characteristics,</p>
<p>we cannot hold progress hostage to that.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ve talked about, perhaps we&rsquo;ll save this</p>
<p>for another time because it&rsquo;s such a fascinating conversation.</p>
<p>You talked about this with Glenn Beck,</p>
<p>is the whole sort of stagnation of growth</p>
<p>and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Your idea is that in as much as the current situation</p>
<p>is a kind of Ponzi scheme,</p>
<p>the current situation in the United States</p>
<p>is a kind of Ponzi scheme built on the promise</p>
<p>of constant unending innovation,</p>
<p>we need to fund the true innovators</p>
<p>and encourage them and empower them</p>
<p>and sort of culturally say that this is what</p>
<p>this country is about is the brilliant minds.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna kill each other if we don&rsquo;t grow.</p>
<p>Growth is like an immune system</p>
<p>and you always have pathogens present,</p>
<p>but if you don&rsquo;t have growth present,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t fight the pathogens in your society.</p>
<p>And right now the pathogens are spreading everywhere.</p>
<p>So if we don&rsquo;t get growth into our system fairly quickly,</p>
<p>we are in really seriously bad shape.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s very important that if I had a horrible person</p>
<p>who was capable of building something</p>
<p>that would give us all a certain amount</p>
<p>of what I&rsquo;ve called financial beta</p>
<p>to some new technology where we all benefit,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say quantum computing comes in</p>
<p>and everybody, the dry cleaner</p>
<p>has a quantum computing angle, right?</p>
<p>Yes. Okay.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s necessary to keep this system that we built going.</p>
<p>We can try to redesign the system,</p>
<p>but our system expects growth</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ve started it for growth</p>
<p>and the madness that we&rsquo;re seeing</p>
<p>is the failure of our immune system</p>
<p>to be able to handle the pathogens</p>
<p>that have always been present.</p>
<p>So people can say, well, this was always there.</p>
<p>Yes, it was.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s changed was your immune system.</p>
<p>We have got to make sure that one,</p>
<p>we understand why diversity</p>
<p>is potentially really important.</p>
<p>We have mined certain communities to death.</p>
<p>You and I are Ashkenazi Jews.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that Ashkenazi Jews</p>
<p>are good at technical stuff.</p>
<p>We know that the Chinese are good at technical stuff.</p>
<p>The Indians have many people</p>
<p>who are good at technical stuff as the Japanese.</p>
<p>So I also believe that we have communities</p>
<p>where if you think about the Pareto idea</p>
<p>of diminishing returns,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;ve never mined a community,</p>
<p>many of the people you&rsquo;re gonna get at the beginning</p>
<p>are gonna be amazing because that community,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, did you drill for more oil in Texas?</p>
<p>Texas is pretty thoroughly picked over.</p>
<p>Do you find someplace that&rsquo;s completely insane?</p>
<p>Maybe there&rsquo;s oil there, who knows?</p>
<p>And in particular, I would like to displace our reliance</p>
<p>on our military competitors in Asia</p>
<p>in our scientific laboratories with women,</p>
<p>with African Americans, with Latinos,</p>
<p>people who are in different categories</p>
<p>than we have traditionally sourced.</p>
<p>And I would like to get them the money</p>
<p>that the market would normally give these fields</p>
<p>were we not using visas in place of payment, right?</p>
<p>Now, I have a crazy idea,</p>
<p>which is that I play, you and I both play music,</p>
<p>and I find the analytic work that I do</p>
<p>when I&rsquo;m trying to figure out chord progressions</p>
<p>and symmetries and tritones, all these sorts of things</p>
<p>to be very similar to the work that I do</p>
<p>when I do physics or math.</p>
<p>I believe that one of the things that is true</p>
<p>is that the analytic contributions of African Americans</p>
<p>to music are probably fungible to science.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know that that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s true I haven&rsquo;t done controlled research,</p>
<p>but I believe that it is very important</p>
<p>to let the People&rsquo;s Republic of China know</p>
<p>that they are not staffing our laboratories anymore,</p>
<p>and that we need to look to our own people.</p>
<p>And in particular, we are going to get a huge benefit</p>
<p>for making sure that women, Black Americans, Latinos</p>
<p>are in a position to take over some of these things</p>
<p>because many of these communities have been underutilized.</p>
<p>Now, I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s an insane idea.</p>
<p>I want to hear somebody tell me why it&rsquo;s an insane idea,</p>
<p>but I believe that part of what we need to do</p>
<p>is we need to recognize that there are security issues,</p>
<p>there are geopolitical issues with the funding of science,</p>
<p>and that what we&rsquo;ve done is we&rsquo;ve starved our world</p>
<p>for innovation, and if we don&rsquo;t get back</p>
<p>to the business of innovation,</p>
<p>we should be doing diversity and inclusion</p>
<p>out of greed rather than guilt.</p>
<p>Now, part of the problem with this</p>
<p>is that a lot of the energy behind diversity and inclusion</p>
<p>is based on guilt and accusation.</p>
<p>And what I want is I want to kick ass,</p>
<p>and my hope is that diminishing returns favors</p>
<p>mining the communities that have not been traditionally mined</p>
<p>in order to extract output from those communities,</p>
<p>unless there&rsquo;s a flaw in that plan.</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s a flaw, somebody needs to tell me.</p>
<p>If there isn&rsquo;t a flaw, we need to get greedy</p>
<p>about innovation rather than guilty about innovation.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really brilliantly put.</p>
<p>My biggest problem with what I see</p>
<p>is it exactly speaks to that in the discussion of diversity.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s used, when it&rsquo;s grounded in guilt,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s then used as a hammer to shame people</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t care about diversity enough.</p>
<p>F that shit, okay?</p>
<p>So my point is I&rsquo;m excited about the idea</p>
<p>of Jimi Hendrix doing quantum field theory.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m excited about the idea of Art Tatum</p>
<p>trying to figure out what the neural nets</p>
<p>figured out about protein folding.</p>
<p>I have some idea of the level of intellect</p>
<p>of people who have not found their way into STEM subjects</p>
<p>in incredibly technically demanding areas.</p>
<p>And if there&rsquo;s a flaw in that theory,</p>
<p>I want somebody to present the flaw.</p>
<p>But right now, my belief is that</p>
<p>these things are merit based.</p>
<p>And if you really believe in structural oppression,</p>
<p>you do not want an affirmative action program.</p>
<p>You wanna make sure that people have huge amounts</p>
<p>of resources to get themselves into position.</p>
<p>I wanna push out,</p>
<p>I just tried this on this Clubhouse application.</p>
<p>I wanna push out Klein bottles as a secret sign</p>
<p>inside of rap videos in hip hop, right?</p>
<p>I want people to have an idea</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s an amazing world.</p>
<p>And I wanna get the people who,</p>
<p>hopefully I&rsquo;m trying to lure into science and engineering.</p>
<p>I want to get them paid.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want them as the cheap substitutes</p>
<p>for the fleeing white males who&rsquo;ve learned</p>
<p>that they can&rsquo;t make any money in science and engineering.</p>
<p>So the problem is that we need to take over the ship Lex.</p>
<p>And it doesn&rsquo;t need to be you and me</p>
<p>because quite honestly, I have no desire to administer.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna be the chief executive officer of anything.</p>
<p>What I do want is I want the baby boomers</p>
<p>who&rsquo;ve made this mess and can&rsquo;t see it to be gone.</p>
<p>They had almost all of our universities</p>
<p>and I want fresh blood, fresh resources.</p>
<p>I want academic freedom and I want greed for our country</p>
<p>and for the future to determine diversity inclusion</p>
<p>as opposed to shame and guilt,</p>
<p>which is destroying our fabric.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s as good of a diversity statement as I&rsquo;ve ever heard.</p>
<p>This is a U turn, but somebody commented on the tweet</p>
<p>you sent that as one of the top comments,</p>
<p>they definitely have to ask you about cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a U turn, but not really.</p>
<p>Since you&rsquo;re an economist, since you&rsquo;re deep,</p>
<p>not an economist.</p>
<p>I mean, I pretend to be an economist,</p>
<p>hoping that the economists will take issue</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m not an economist so that I can advance</p>
<p>gauge theoretic and field theoretic economics,</p>
<p>which the economics profession has failed to acknowledge</p>
<p>was a major innovation</p>
<p>that happened approximately 25 years ago.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that economists understand</p>
<p>what a price index is that measures inflation,</p>
<p>nor do I think economists understand what a growth index</p>
<p>or a product, a quantity index is that measures GDP.</p>
<p>I think that they don&rsquo;t even understand the basics</p>
<p>of price and quantity index construction.</p>
<p>And therefore they can&rsquo;t possibly review</p>
<p>field theoretic economics.</p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t review gauge theoretic economics.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re intellectually not in a position</p>
<p>to manage their own field.</p>
<p>You talked about that there&rsquo;s a stagnation</p>
<p>in growth currently.</p>
<p>I looked at, from my microeconomics,</p>
<p>macroeconomics in college perspective,</p>
<p>GDP doesn&rsquo;t seem to capture the productivity,</p>
<p>the full, the spectrum of what I think is</p>
<p>as a functioning successful society.</p>
<p>What do you think is broken about GDP?</p>
<p>What does it need to include?</p>
<p>These indices, like what?</p>
<p>Let me explain what they don&rsquo;t understand to begin with.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Imagine that all prices and all quantities of output</p>
<p>are the same at the end of the year</p>
<p>as they are at the beginning.</p>
<p>And you ask what happened during that year?</p>
<p>Was there inflation?</p>
<p>They meandered over the course of the year,</p>
<p>but miraculously they all came back to exactly their values.</p>
<p>The amount produced at the end of the year</p>
<p>is the same as at the beginning in every single quantity.</p>
<p>Typically the claim would be that the price index</p>
<p>should be 1.0 and that the quantity index should be 1.0.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s clearly wrong.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s much easier to see with,</p>
<p>it speaks to a fundamental confusion that economists have.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t understand that the economy is curved</p>
<p>and not flat.</p>
<p>In a curved economy, everything should be path dependence,</p>
<p>but they view path dependence as a problem</p>
<p>because they are effectively the flat earth society</p>
<p>of market analysis.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t understand that what they&rsquo;ve called,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ve actually called it the cycling problem,</p>
<p>is exactly what they need to understand</p>
<p>to advance their field.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll give you a very simple example, okay?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s imagine that we have Bob and Carol in one hedge fund</p>
<p>and Ted and Alice in another.</p>
<p>In both cases, the females, that is, Alice and Carol,</p>
<p>are the chief investment officers,</p>
<p>and Bob and Ted are the chief marketing officers</p>
<p>in charge of trying to get money into the fund</p>
<p>and trying to get people not to, in fact,</p>
<p>remove their money from the funds, okay?</p>
<p>If you, in fact, had a hedge fund</p>
<p>with Bob and Carol and Ted and Alice,</p>
<p>and both hedge funds were invested in assets</p>
<p>whose prices came back to the same levels</p>
<p>and whose exposures were in the same quantities,</p>
<p>and you wanted to compensate these two hedge funds,</p>
<p>would you compensate them the same necessarily?</p>
<p>What if, for example, Carol was killing it</p>
<p>in terms of investments?</p>
<p>Every time she bought some sort of security,</p>
<p>the price of that security went up, okay?</p>
<p>But Bob was the worst marketing officer,</p>
<p>and as chief marketing officer,</p>
<p>there were tons of redemptions</p>
<p>because Bob was constantly drunk,</p>
<p>Bob was making off color comments.</p>
<p>Now, as a result, at the end of the year,</p>
<p>the fund hasn&rsquo;t grown in size</p>
<p>because even though Carol was crushing it</p>
<p>in terms of the investments,</p>
<p>Bob was screwing up everything</p>
<p>and the redemptions were legendary,</p>
<p>so people were making money</p>
<p>and still pulling it out of the fund.</p>
<p>In the other fund, Alice can&rsquo;t seem to buy a base hit</p>
<p>every time she gets into a security, the thing plummets,</p>
<p>but Ted&rsquo;s amazing marketing skills allowed the fund</p>
<p>to get all sorts of new subscriptions</p>
<p>and halted the redemptions as people hoped</p>
<p>that the fund would get its act together, okay.</p>
<p>Price indices should be how Carol and Alice are compensated,</p>
<p>and quantity indices should be how Bob and Ted</p>
<p>are compensated, so even though both funds</p>
<p>had closed loops that come back to the original states,</p>
<p>what happened during the period that they were active</p>
<p>tells you how people are supposed to be compensated.</p>
<p>Now, we know that whatever the increase</p>
<p>in the price index is, is compensated by a decrease</p>
<p>in the quantity index or conversely,</p>
<p>because prices and quantities</p>
<p>return to their original values.</p>
<p>You could have another fund where nothing much happened,</p>
<p>there were no redemptions, no subscriptions,</p>
<p>the fund remained in cash the whole time.</p>
<p>So in that third fund, you know,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s call that Tristan and Isolde, right?</p>
<p>That fund should have no bonuses paid</p>
<p>because nobody did anything,</p>
<p>but nobody should be fired either.</p>
<p>Now, the fact that the economists don&rsquo;t even understand</p>
<p>that this is what their price and quantity indices</p>
<p>were intended to do, that they don&rsquo;t understand</p>
<p>that you can actually give what would be called</p>
<p>ordinal agents the freedom to change their preferences</p>
<p>and still have something defined as a</p>
<p>CONUS cost of living adjustment.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t even understand the mathematics of their field.</p>
<p>So the indices need to be able to capture</p>
<p>some kind of dynamics that&hellip;</p>
<p>We have had indices that capture these dynamics</p>
<p>due to the work of Francois de Vizier since 1925.</p>
<p>But the economists have not even understood</p>
<p>what de Vizier&rsquo;s index truly represent.</p>
<p>What do you miss with such crude indices then?</p>
<p>Well, you miss the fact that you&rsquo;re supposed</p>
<p>to have a field theoretic subject.</p>
<p>The representative consumer should actually</p>
<p>be a probability distribution on the space</p>
<p>of all possible consumers weighted by the probability</p>
<p>of getting any particular pull from the distribution.</p>
<p>We should not have a single gauge of inflation.</p>
<p>What is that in 1973 dollars?</p>
<p>Any more than you should be able to say</p>
<p>it was 59 degrees Fahrenheit on earth yesterday.</p>
<p>So when we get to the cryptocurrency,</p>
<p>what I&rsquo;m going to say is that</p>
<p>because we didn&rsquo;t found economic theory</p>
<p>on the proper marginal revolution,</p>
<p>because we missed the major opportunity,</p>
<p>which is that the differential calculus of markets</p>
<p>is gauge theory.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not ordinary differential calculus.</p>
<p>We found that out in finance</p>
<p>that it was stochastic differential calculus.</p>
<p>We have the wrong version of the differential calculus</p>
<p>underneath all of modern economic theory.</p>
<p>And part of what I&rsquo;ve been pushing for in cryptocurrencies</p>
<p>is the idea that we should be understanding</p>
<p>that gold is a gauge theory,</p>
<p>just as modern economic theory</p>
<p>is supposed to be a gauge theory.</p>
<p>And that we should be looking to liberate cryptocurrencies</p>
<p>and more importantly distributed computing</p>
<p>from the problem of this unwanted global aspect,</p>
<p>which is the blockchain.</p>
<p>The thing that is most celebrated in some sense</p>
<p>about Bitcoin is in fact the reason</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m least enthusiastic about it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m hugely enthusiastic about what Satoshi did.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s an intermediate step towards trying to figure out</p>
<p>what should digital gold actually be?</p>
<p>If physical gold is a collection of up quarks</p>
<p>and down quarks in the form of protons and neutrons</p>
<p>held together, the quarks by gluons</p>
<p>with electrons orbiting and held together by photons</p>
<p>with the occasional weak interaction beta decay,</p>
<p>all of those are gauge theories.</p>
<p>So gold is actually coming from gauge theory</p>
<p>and markets are coming from gauge theory.</p>
<p>And the opportunity to do locally enforced conservation laws,</p>
<p>which effectively is what a Bitcoin transaction is,</p>
<p>should theoretically be founded on a different principle</p>
<p>that is not the blockchain.</p>
<p>It should be a gauge theoretic concept</p>
<p>in which effectively the tokens are excitations</p>
<p>on a network of computer nodes.</p>
<p>And the fact that, let&rsquo;s imagine that this is some token.</p>
<p>By moving it from my custodianship to your custodianship,</p>
<p>effectively I pushed that glass as a gauge theory</p>
<p>towards your region of the table.</p>
<p>We should be recognizing the gauge theory</p>
<p>is the correct differential calculus for the 21st century.</p>
<p>In fact, it should have been there in the 20th century.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re saying it captures these individual dynamics,</p>
<p>much richer.</p>
<p>Why should my giving you a token have to be,</p>
<p>why should we alert the global community</p>
<p>in this token that that occurred?</p>
<p>You can talk about side chains,</p>
<p>you can talk about any means of doing this,</p>
<p>but effectively we have a problem,</p>
<p>which is if I think about this differently,</p>
<p>I have a glass that is extant,</p>
<p>you have a glass that is abstent.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re supposed to call the constructor method</p>
<p>on your glass at the same moment</p>
<p>we call the destructor method on my glass</p>
<p>in order to have a conservation principle.</p>
<p>It would be far more efficient to do this</p>
<p>with the one system that is known</p>
<p>never to throw an exception, which is nature.</p>
<p>And nature has chosen gauge theory and geometry</p>
<p>for her underlying language.</p>
<p>We now know due to work of Pia Malani at Harvard</p>
<p>in economics in the mid 1990s, which I was her coauthor on,</p>
<p>but I wish to promote her as well as this being my idea.</p>
<p>We know that modern economic theory</p>
<p>is a naturally occurring gauge theory.</p>
<p>And the failure of that community to acknowledge</p>
<p>that that work occurred and that it was put down</p>
<p>for reasons that make no analytic sense</p>
<p>is important in particular due to the relatively</p>
<p>new innovation of distributed computing</p>
<p>and Satoshi&rsquo;s brainchild.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re thinking we need to have the mathematics</p>
<p>that captures, that enforces cryptocurrency</p>
<p>as a distributed system as opposed to a centralized one</p>
<p>where the blockchain says that crypto should be centralized.</p>
<p>The abundance economy much discussed in Silicon Valley</p>
<p>or what&rsquo;s left of it is actually a huge threat</p>
<p>to the planet because what it really is</p>
<p>is that it is what Marc Andreessen</p>
<p>has called software eating the world.</p>
<p>And what that means is that you&rsquo;re gonna push</p>
<p>things from being private goods and services</p>
<p>into public goods and services and public goods</p>
<p>and services cannot have price and value tied together.</p>
<p>Ergo, people will produce things of incredible value</p>
<p>to the world that they cannot command a price</p>
<p>and they will not be able to capture the value</p>
<p>that they have created or a significant enough</p>
<p>fraction of it.</p>
<p>The abundance economy is a disaster.</p>
<p>It will lead to a reduction in human freedom.</p>
<p>The great innovation of Satoshi is locally enforced</p>
<p>or semi locally enforced conservation laws</p>
<p>where the idea is just as gold is hard,</p>
<p>why is gold hard to create or destroy?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s created not only in stars</p>
<p>but in violent events involving stars</p>
<p>like supernova collisions.</p>
<p>When gold is created and we transact,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re using conservation laws.</p>
<p>The physics determines the custodianship,</p>
<p>whatever it is that I don&rsquo;t have, you now have</p>
<p>and conversely, in such a situation,</p>
<p>we should be looking for the abstraction</p>
<p>that most closely matches the physical world</p>
<p>because the physical world is known</p>
<p>not to throw an exception.</p>
<p>The blockchain is a vulnerability.</p>
<p>The idea that the 51% problem isn&rsquo;t solved,</p>
<p>that you could have crazy race conditions,</p>
<p>all of these things, we know that they&rsquo;re solved</p>
<p>inside of gauge theory somehow.</p>
<p>So the important thing is to recognize</p>
<p>that one of the greatest intellectual feats ever</p>
<p>in the history of economic theory took place already</p>
<p>and was essentially instantly buried</p>
<p>and I will stand by those comments.</p>
<p>Satoshi, wherever you are, I probably know you.</p>
<p>Are you Satoshi?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>No, no, no, I don&rsquo;t have that kind of ability.</p>
<p>I really don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I do other things.</p>
<p>Speaking of Satoshi and gauge theory,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve mentioned to Brian Keating</p>
<p>that you may be releasing a geometric unity paper this year</p>
<p>or some other form of additional material on the topic.</p>
<p>What is your thinking around this?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the process you&rsquo;re going through now</p>
<p>in preparing this?</p>
<p>I used April 1st to try to start a tradition</p>
<p>which I hope to use to liberate mankind.</p>
<p>The tradition is that at least one day a year,</p>
<p>you should be able to say heretical things</p>
<p>and not have Jack Dorsey boot you off or Mark Zuckerberg.</p>
<p>Your provost shouldn&rsquo;t call you up and say,</p>
<p>what did you say?</p>
<p>We need at some level to have a jubilee</p>
<p>from centralized control.</p>
<p>And so my hope is that,</p>
<p>you know what a tradition is in America?</p>
<p>Something a baby boomer did twice.</p>
<p>Impeachment.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s very funny.</p>
<p>Anyway, so I&rsquo;m not a baby boomer, but as an exer,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve thought about whether or not April 1st</p>
<p>would be a good date on which to release a printed version</p>
<p>of what I already said in lecture form.</p>
<p>Because I think it&rsquo;s hysterically funny</p>
<p>that the physics community claims</p>
<p>that it can&rsquo;t decode a lecture.</p>
<p>It must be paper.</p>
<p>And you know what?</p>
<p>There will be a steady stream of new complaints</p>
<p>up until the point that they fit it into a narrative</p>
<p>that they like.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m thinking about April 1st</p>
<p>as a date in which to release a document</p>
<p>and it won&rsquo;t be perfectly complete,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;ll be very complete.</p>
<p>And then they&rsquo;ll try to say, it&rsquo;s wrong.</p>
<p>Or you already did it.</p>
<p>Or no, that was dumb,</p>
<p>but what we just did on top of it is brilliant.</p>
<p>Or it doesn&rsquo;t match experiment.</p>
<p>Or who knows what.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll go through all of their usual nonsense.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s time to go.</p>
<p>Is there still puzzles in your own mind</p>
<p>that need to be figured out</p>
<p>for you to try to put it on paper?</p>
<p>I mean, those are different mediums, right?</p>
<p>It was a great question.</p>
<p>I did not count on something</p>
<p>that turns out to be important.</p>
<p>When you work on your own outside of the system</p>
<p>for a long time,</p>
<p>you probably don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re gonna be doing this</p>
<p>as a 55 year old man.</p>
<p>And I have been so long outside</p>
<p>of math and physics departments,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve been occupied with so many other things</p>
<p>as you can see,</p>
<p>that the old idea that I had was</p>
<p>if I always did it in little pieces,</p>
<p>then I was always safe because it wouldn&rsquo;t be stealable.</p>
<p>And so now those pieces never got assembled completely.</p>
<p>In essence, I have all the pieces</p>
<p>and I can fit them together.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s probably a small amount of glue code.</p>
<p>Like there are a few algebraic things</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve forgotten how to do.</p>
<p>I may or may not figure them out</p>
<p>between now and April 1st.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s pretty complete.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s the puzzle you&rsquo;re kind of struggling</p>
<p>to now figure out,</p>
<p>to get it all in the same, the glue together.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t tell you whether the theory</p>
<p>is correct or incorrect.</p>
<p>But for example, there&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s the exact form</p>
<p>of the supersymmetry algebra,</p>
<p>or what&rsquo;s the rule for passing a minus sign</p>
<p>through a particular operator.</p>
<p>And all of that stuff got a lot more difficult</p>
<p>because I didn&rsquo;t do it every,</p>
<p>look, it&rsquo;s a little bit like if you&rsquo;re a violinist</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t touch your violin regularly for 15 years,</p>
<p>you come back to it and you pretty much know the pieces,</p>
<p>sort of, but there&rsquo;s lots of stuff that&rsquo;s missing,</p>
<p>your tone is off and that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>I would say I&rsquo;ll get the ship to the harbor</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;ll require a tugboat probably to get it in.</p>
<p>And if the tugboat doesn&rsquo;t show up,</p>
<p>then I&rsquo;ll pilot the thing right into the dock myself.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not a big deal.</p>
<p>I think that it is essentially complete.</p>
<p>Psychologically, just as a human being,</p>
<p>this is, I remember perhaps by accident,</p>
<p>but maybe there&rsquo;s no accidents in the universe.</p>
<p>I was tuned in, I don&rsquo;t remember where,</p>
<p>on April 1st to you, oh, I think on your Discord,</p>
<p>kind of thinking about, thinking through this release.</p>
<p>I mean, it wasn&rsquo;t like,</p>
<p>it wasn&rsquo;t obvious that you were going to do it,</p>
<p>you were thinking through it.</p>
<p>And I remember there was intellectual,</p>
<p>personal, psychological struggle with this, right?</p>
<p>Well, because I thought it was dangerous.</p>
<p>If this turns out to be right,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what it unlocks.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s wrong, I think I understand where we are.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s wrong, it&rsquo;ll be the first fool&rsquo;s gold</p>
<p>that really looks like a theory of everything.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll be the iron pyrites of physics.</p>
<p>And we haven&rsquo;t even had fool&rsquo;s gold in my opinion yet.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>So what is your intuition why this looks right to you?</p>
<p>Like why it feels like it would be,</p>
<p>if wrong, the first fool&rsquo;s gold.</p>
<p>I can say it very simply.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s way smarter than I am.</p>
<p>Can you break that apart a little more?</p>
<p>Every time you poke at it,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s giving you intuitions that follow</p>
<p>with the currently known physics.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s put it in computer science terms.</p>
<p>Yes, please.</p>
<p>Okay, there&rsquo;s a concept of technical debt</p>
<p>that computer scientists struggle with.</p>
<p>As you commit crimes,</p>
<p>you have to pay those crimes back at a later date.</p>
<p>In general, most of the problem with physical theories</p>
<p>is that as you try to do something that matches reality,</p>
<p>you usually have to go into some structure</p>
<p>that gets you farther away.</p>
<p>And your hope is, is that you&rsquo;re gonna be able</p>
<p>to pay back the technical debt.</p>
<p>And in general, these wind up as check hiding schemes</p>
<p>or like you&rsquo;re funding a startup</p>
<p>and there are too many pivots, right?</p>
<p>So you keep adding epicycles in order to cover,</p>
<p>things that have gone wrong.</p>
<p>My belief is, is that this thing</p>
<p>represents something like a summit to me.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m very proud of having found a route up this summit.</p>
<p>But the root is what&rsquo;s due to me.</p>
<p>The summit can&rsquo;t possibly be due to me.</p>
<p>You know, like Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay</p>
<p>did not create Mount Everest.</p>
<p>They know that they didn&rsquo;t create that.</p>
<p>They figured out a way up.</p>
<p>You gotta tell me what Mount Everest</p>
<p>is in this metaphor relative</p>
<p>and also connected to the technical debt.</p>
<p>So technical debt is a negative thing that it&rsquo;s kind of,</p>
<p>you will eventually have to pay it.</p>
<p>Are you saying in the,</p>
<p>in the ascent that you&rsquo;re seeing now in the theory</p>
<p>is you do not have much technical debt.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>That what happens is, is that early on what I would say is,</p>
<p>I believe now that the physics community</p>
<p>has said many things incorrectly</p>
<p>about the current state of the universe.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not wildly off, which is why,</p>
<p>like for example, the claim is that</p>
<p>there are three generations of matter.</p>
<p>I do not believe that there are three generations of matter.</p>
<p>I believe that there are two generations of matter</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a third collection</p>
<p>that looks like a generation of matter as the first two,</p>
<p>only at low energy.</p>
<p>Okay, well, that&rsquo;s not a frequent claim.</p>
<p>People imagine that there are three</p>
<p>or more generations of matter.</p>
<p>I would claim that that&rsquo;s false.</p>
<p>People claim that the matter is chiral.</p>
<p>That is, it knows it&rsquo;s left from its right.</p>
<p>I would claim that the chirality is not fundamental,</p>
<p>but it is emergent.</p>
<p>But we could keep going at all these sorts of things.</p>
<p>People think that space time</p>
<p>is the fundamental geometrical construct.</p>
<p>I do not agree.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s something that I&rsquo;ve termed the observers.</p>
<p>All of these different things</p>
<p>represent a series of overinterpretations of the world</p>
<p>that preclude progress.</p>
<p>So you gave, I think you gave some credit</p>
<p>to string theory as, string theory,</p>
<p>I think loop quantum gravity, if I remember correctly,</p>
<p>as like getting close to the fool&rsquo;s gold.</p>
<p>Well, I said that Garrett Lisi, phenomenologically,</p>
<p>gets a lot of things right.</p>
<p>He gets, he&rsquo;s got a reason for chirality,</p>
<p>a reason for uniqueness using E8.</p>
<p>In fact, E8 uses something called vial fermions,</p>
<p>which are chiral.</p>
<p>He has a way of getting geometry</p>
<p>to get Riemann&rsquo;s geometry underneath general relativity</p>
<p>to play with Erisman&rsquo;s geometry,</p>
<p>which is underneath the standard model,</p>
<p>using something called Cartan connections</p>
<p>that are out of favor.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s figured out something involving super connections</p>
<p>to make sure that the fermion,</p>
<p>the matter in the system isn&rsquo;t quantized</p>
<p>the same way as the bosons were,</p>
<p>which is a problem in his old theory.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s got something about three generations for triality.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s got a lot of phenomenological hits.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think Garrett&rsquo;s theory works.</p>
<p>It also has a very simple Lagrangian.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s basically using the Yang Mills norm squared,</p>
<p>the same thing you would use as a cost function</p>
<p>if you were doing neural nets, okay?</p>
<p>The string theorists have a different selling point,</p>
<p>which is that they may have gotten</p>
<p>a renormalizable theory of gravity</p>
<p>if quantum gravity was what we were meant to do.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ve done some stuff with black holes</p>
<p>that they can get some solutions correct.</p>
<p>And then they have lots of agreements</p>
<p>with where they show mathematical truths</p>
<p>that mathematicians didn&rsquo;t even know.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very underwhelmed by string theory</p>
<p>based on how many people have worked on it</p>
<p>and how little is supporting the claims</p>
<p>to it being a theory of everything.</p>
<p>But those are the two that I take quite seriously.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t yet take Wolfram&rsquo;s quite seriously</p>
<p>because if he really finds one of these cellular automata</p>
<p>that are really distinct and generative,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll be amazing.</p>
<p>But he&rsquo;s looking for such a thing.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s found anything.</p>
<p>Tegmark, I view as a philosopher</p>
<p>who is somehow taking credit for Platonism,</p>
<p>which I don&rsquo;t see any reason for fighting with Max</p>
<p>because I like Max, but if it ever comes time,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m putting a post it note that I&rsquo;m not positive</p>
<p>the mathematical universe hypothesis</p>
<p>is really anything new.</p>
<p>And in general, loop quantum gravity really,</p>
<p>I think grew out of some hopes</p>
<p>that the general relativistic community had</p>
<p>that they would be able to do particle theory.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think that they&rsquo;ve shown</p>
<p>any particle theoretic realism.</p>
<p>So essentially, here&rsquo;s what I really think, Lex.</p>
<p>I think we didn&rsquo;t understand how big the difference</p>
<p>between an effective theory and a theory of everything</p>
<p>is conceptually.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s not mathematically that different,</p>
<p>but conceptually trying to figure out</p>
<p>what a theory of every, how does the universe,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve compared it to Escher&rsquo;s drawing hands.</p>
<p>How do two hands draw themselves into existence?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the puzzle that I think has just been wanting.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll be honest, I&rsquo;m really surprised</p>
<p>that the theoretical physics community didn&rsquo;t even get up</p>
<p>on their high horse and say,</p>
<p>this is the most stupid nonsense imaginable,</p>
<p>because clearly I always say I&rsquo;m not a physicist.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m an amateur with a heart as big as all outdoors.</p>
<p>So in your journey of releasing this,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m sure further maybe it will be</p>
<p>another American tradition on April 1st</p>
<p>that will continue for years to come.</p>
<p>I hope so.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s sort of crumbs along the way</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m hoping to collect in my naive view of things</p>
<p>of the beauty that, in your geometric view of the universe.</p>
<p>So one question I&rsquo;d like to ask is</p>
<p>if you were to challenge me to visualize something beautiful,</p>
<p>something important about geometric unity</p>
<p>in my struggle to appreciate some of its beauty</p>
<p>from the outsider&rsquo;s perspective, what would that thing be?</p>
<p>Interesting question.</p>
<p>Perhaps we can both have a journey</p>
<p>towards April 1st.</p>
<p>Take a look at that.</p>
<p>Some kind of a scrunchie that I picked up on Melrose,</p>
<p>not Melrose, Montana in Santa Monica.</p>
<p>Now you&rsquo;ll notice that all of those disks</p>
<p>rotate independently.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>If you rotate groups of those in a way that is continuous,</p>
<p>but not uniform everywhere,</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re doing is a so called gauge transformation</p>
<p>on the torus seen as a U1 bundle over a U1 space time.</p>
<p>So the concept of space time here</p>
<p>in a very simplified case isn&rsquo;t four dimensional,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s one dimensional, it&rsquo;s just a circle.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a circle above every point in the circle</p>
<p>represented by those little disks.</p>
<p>So imagine if you will, that we took a rubber band</p>
<p>and placed it around here and decided</p>
<p>that that was a function from the circle</p>
<p>into the circle that is representing a Y axis</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s wrapped around itself.</p>
<p>Well, you would have an idea of what it means</p>
<p>for a function to be constant,</p>
<p>if it just went all around the outside.</p>
<p>But what happens if I turn this a little bit?</p>
<p>Then the function would be mostly constant.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;d have a little place where it dipped and it went back.</p>
<p>It turns out that you can transform that function</p>
<p>and transform the derivative that says that function</p>
<p>is equal to zero when I take its derivative</p>
<p>at the same time.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what a gauge transformation is.</p>
<p>Amazing to me that we don&rsquo;t have a simple video,</p>
<p>visualizing things that I&rsquo;ve already had built</p>
<p>and that I can clearly demonstrate.</p>
<p>When you do that Taurus,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s the code of the Taurus is itself generating.</p>
<p>The Taurus.</p>
<p>The spinning Taurus.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>This is a U1 principle bundle.</p>
<p>And the world needs to know what a gauge theory is,</p>
<p>not by analogy, not with Lawrence Krauss saying,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like a checkerboard.</p>
<p>If you change some of the colors this way,</p>
<p>not saying that it&rsquo;s a local symmetry involving,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s none of those things.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a theory of differential calculus</p>
<p>where the functions and the derivatives</p>
<p>are both subject to a particular kind of change</p>
<p>so that if a function was constant under one derivative,</p>
<p>then the new function is constant under the new derivative</p>
<p>transformed in the same fashion.</p>
<p>And would you put that under the category</p>
<p>of just gauge transformations?</p>
<p>Yes, that would be gauge transformations</p>
<p>applied to sections and connections</p>
<p>where connections are the derivatives in the theory.</p>
<p>This is easily explained.</p>
<p>It is pathological that the community of people</p>
<p>who understand what I&rsquo;m saying have never bothered</p>
<p>to do this in a clear fashion for the general public.</p>
<p>You and I could visualize this overnight.</p>
<p>This is not hard.</p>
<p>The public needs to know in some sense</p>
<p>that let&rsquo;s say quantum electrodynamics,</p>
<p>the theory of photons and electrons,</p>
<p>more or less electrons are functions</p>
<p>and photons are derivatives.</p>
<p>Now there&rsquo;s some, you can object in some ways,</p>
<p>but basically a gauge theory is the way</p>
<p>in which you can translate a shift</p>
<p>in the definition of the functions</p>
<p>and the shift of the definition of the derivatives</p>
<p>so that the underlying physics is not harmed or changed.</p>
<p>So you have to do both at the same time.</p>
<p>Now you and I can visualize that.</p>
<p>So if what you wanted to do rather than going directly</p>
<p>to geometric unity is that I could sit down with you</p>
<p>and I could say here are the various components</p>
<p>of geometric unity and if the public needs a visualization</p>
<p>in order to play along, we&rsquo;ve got a little over two months</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;d be happy to work with you.</p>
<p>I love that as a challenge and I&rsquo;ll take it on</p>
<p>and I hope we do make it happen.</p>
<p>And David Goggins, if Lex doesn&rsquo;t do some super macho thing</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s gotta work to get some of this stuff done,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll understand he&rsquo;ll be available to you after April.</p>
<p>Thank you for the escape clause.</p>
<p>I really needed that escape clause.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad that&rsquo;s on record.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m worried 48 miles in 48 hours.</p>
<p>By the way, I just wanna say how much I admire</p>
<p>your willingness to keep this kind of hardcore attitude.</p>
<p>I know that Russians have it and Russian Jews have it</p>
<p>in spades, but it&rsquo;s harder to do in a society that&rsquo;s sloppy</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s weak and that&rsquo;s lazy.</p>
<p>And the fact that you bring so much heart to saying,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna bring this to jujitsu,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna bring this to guitar, I&rsquo;m gonna bring this to AI,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna bring this to podcasting.</p>
<p>It comes through loud and clear.</p>
<p>I just find it completely and utterly inspiring</p>
<p>that you keep this kind of hardcore aspect at the same time</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re the guy who&rsquo;s extolling the virtue of love</p>
<p>in a modern society and doing it at scale.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>That means a lot.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why I&rsquo;m doing it,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m just following my heart on it</p>
<p>and just going with the gut.</p>
<p>It seems to make sense somehow.</p>
<p>I personally think we better get tougher</p>
<p>or we&rsquo;re gonna get in a world of pain.</p>
<p>And I do think that when it comes time to lead,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s great to have people who you know</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t crack under pressure.</p>
<p>Do you mind if we talk about love</p>
<p>and what it takes to be a father for a bit?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Do you mind if Zev joins us?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be an honor.</p>
<p>So Eric, I&rsquo;ve talked to your son Zev,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s an incredible human being,</p>
<p>but let me ask you,</p>
<p>this might be difficult</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re both sitting together.</p>
<p>What advice do you have for him</p>
<p>as he makes his way in this world,</p>
<p>especially given that, as we mentioned before on Joe Rogan,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re flawed in that just like all humans, you&rsquo;re mortal.</p>
<p>Well, at some level, I guess one of my issues</p>
<p>is that I&rsquo;ve got to stop giving quite so much advice.</p>
<p>Early on, I was very worried</p>
<p>that I could see Zev&rsquo;s abilities</p>
<p>and I could see his challenges</p>
<p>and I saw them in terms of myself.</p>
<p>So a certain amount of Zev rhymes with</p>
<p>whatever I went through as a kid.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t wanna doom him to the same outcomes</p>
<p>that sufficed for me.</p>
<p>I think that he&rsquo;s got a much better head on his shoulders</p>
<p>at age 15, he&rsquo;s much better adjusted.</p>
<p>And in part, it&rsquo;s important for me to recognize</p>
<p>that because I think I did a reasonably decent job early on,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t need to get this part right.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m looking at Zev&rsquo;s trajectory and saying,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna need to be incredibly</p>
<p>and even pathologically self confident.</p>
<p>The antidote for that is gonna be something</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna need to carry on board,</p>
<p>which is radical humility.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re gonna have to have those</p>
<p>in a dialectical tension, which is never resolved,</p>
<p>which is a huge burden.</p>
<p>You are going to have to forgive people</p>
<p>who do not appreciate your gifts</p>
<p>because your gifts are clearly evident.</p>
<p>And many people will have to pretend not to see them</p>
<p>because if they see your gifts,</p>
<p>then they&rsquo;re gonna have to question their entire approach</p>
<p>to education or employment or critical thinking.</p>
<p>And what my hope is, is that you can just forgive those</p>
<p>who don&rsquo;t see them and who complicate</p>
<p>and frustrate your life and realize</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re gonna have to take care of them too.</p>
<p>Zev, let me ask you the more challenging question</p>
<p>because the guy&rsquo;s sitting right here.</p>
<p>What advice do you have for your dad?</p>
<p>Since after talking to you,</p>
<p>I realize you&rsquo;re the more brilliant</p>
<p>aside from the better looking member of the family.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a bit of an odd question.</p>
<p>Sorry.</p>
<p>You can say anything you want.</p>
<p>This is the last time we&rsquo;re gonna be seeing left.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna be an awkward drive home.</p>
<p>I think sort of a new perspective I&rsquo;ve taken on parenting</p>
<p>is that it is a task for which no human</p>
<p>is really supposed to be prepared.</p>
<p>You know, there are in Jewish tradition, for example,</p>
<p>there are myriad analogies in the Torah and the Talmud</p>
<p>that compare the role of a parent to the role of a God,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>That no human is prepared to play God</p>
<p>and create and guide a life,</p>
<p>but somehow we&rsquo;re forced into it as people.</p>
<p>And I think sometimes it&rsquo;s hard for children to understand</p>
<p>that however their parents are failing</p>
<p>sort of has to be.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a theme here.</p>
<p>Is something for which we must budget</p>
<p>because our parents play a role in our lives</p>
<p>of which they&rsquo;re not worthy</p>
<p>and they devote themselves to regardless</p>
<p>because that becomes who they are in a certain sense.</p>
<p>So I hope to have realistic expectations of you as a human</p>
<p>because I think too often it&rsquo;s easy</p>
<p>to have godly expectations of people</p>
<p>who are far from such a role.</p>
<p>And I think I&rsquo;m really happy</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve been as open as you have with me</p>
<p>about the fact that, you know, you really,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t pretend to be a God in my life.</p>
<p>You are a guide who allows me to see myself</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s been very important considering the fact</p>
<p>that by your self teaching paradigm I will have to,</p>
<p>I will have to guide myself and being able to see it</p>
<p>and see myself accurately has been one of the greatest gifts</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve given me.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m very appreciative.</p>
<p>And I want you to know that I don&rsquo;t buy into the role</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re supposed to sort of fake your way through</p>
<p>in my life but I am unbelievably happy</p>
<p>with a more realistic connection</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve been able to build in lieu of it, so.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s been easier on you actually</p>
<p>as you come to realize what I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>what I can&rsquo;t do and that there&rsquo;s been a period of time,</p>
<p>I guess, that&rsquo;s fascinating to me</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re sort of surprised</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t know the answer to a certain thing</p>
<p>as well as you do.</p>
<p>And that I remember going through this</p>
<p>with a particular mathematician who I held,</p>
<p>I still hold in awe, named David Kajdan.</p>
<p>And, you know, he famously said to,</p>
<p>and weirdly our family knew his family</p>
<p>in the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>But he said, you know, Eric,</p>
<p>I always appreciate you coming to my office</p>
<p>because I always find what you have to say interesting</p>
<p>but you have to realize that in the areas</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re talking about, you are no longer the student,</p>
<p>you are actually my teacher.</p>
<p>And I wasn&rsquo;t prepared to hear that.</p>
<p>And there are many ways in which,</p>
<p>as I was just saying with the Mozart,</p>
<p>I am learning at an incredible rate from you.</p>
<p>I used to learn from you</p>
<p>because I didn&rsquo;t understand what was possible.</p>
<p>You were very much, I mean, this is the weird thing.</p>
<p>There used to be this thing called Harvey,</p>
<p>the invisible rabbit.</p>
<p>This guy had a rabbit that was like six feet tall</p>
<p>that only he could see maybe was talking.</p>
<p>And that was like you at age four.</p>
<p>You were saying batshit crazy things</p>
<p>that were all totally sensible</p>
<p>and nobody else could put them together.</p>
<p>And so what&rsquo;s wonderful is that the world hasn&rsquo;t caught on,</p>
<p>but enormous numbers of people are starting to.</p>
<p>And I really do hope that that genuineness of spirit</p>
<p>and that outside the box intellectual commitment</p>
<p>serves you well as the world starts to appreciate</p>
<p>that I think you&rsquo;re a very trustworthy voice.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t get everything right,</p>
<p>but the idea that we have somebody at your age</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s embedded in your generation</p>
<p>who can tell us something about what&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>is really valuable to me.</p>
<p>And I do hope that you&rsquo;ll consider boosting that voice</p>
<p>more than just at the dinner table.</p>
<p>I apologize for saying this four letter word,</p>
<p>but do you love Zev?</p>
<p>Was really worried it was gonna be another four letter word.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so many to choose from.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t even rise to the level of the question.</p>
<p>I mean, I just, there are a tiny number of people</p>
<p>with whom you share so much life</p>
<p>that you can&rsquo;t even think of yourself in their absence.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know if Zev would find that,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s, you can have a kid</p>
<p>and never make this level of connection.</p>
<p>I think even right down to the fact</p>
<p>that when Zev chooses boogie woogie piano</p>
<p>for his own set of reasons,</p>
<p>why I would choose boogie woogie piano</p>
<p>if I could play in any style, it&rsquo;s a question</p>
<p>about a decrease in loneliness.</p>
<p>You know, like my grandfather played the mandolin</p>
<p>and I had to learn some mandolin</p>
<p>because otherwise that instrument would go silent.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t expect that you get this much of a chance</p>
<p>to leave this much of yourself in another person</p>
<p>who is choosing it and recreating it</p>
<p>rather than it being directly instilled.</p>
<p>And my proudest achievement is in a certain sense</p>
<p>having not taught him and having shared this much.</p>
<p>So, you know, it&rsquo;s not even love, it&rsquo;s like well beyond.</p>
<p>So you mentioned love for you making a less lonely world.</p>
<p>I think I speak for, I would argue,</p>
<p>probably millions of people that you, Eric,</p>
<p>because this is a conversation with you,</p>
<p>have made for many people, for me, a less lonely world.</p>
<p>And I can&rsquo;t wait to see how you develop as an intellect,</p>
<p>but also I&rsquo;m so heartworn by the optimism</p>
<p>and the hopefulness that was in you</p>
<p>that I hope develops further.</p>
<p>And lastly, I&rsquo;m deeply thankful that you, Eric are my friend</p>
<p>and would give me, would honor me with this watch.</p>
<p>It means more than words can say.</p>
<p>Thanks guys, thanks for talking today.</p>
