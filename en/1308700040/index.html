    <p>Our card this week is Roberta Johnson, the Ten of Diamonds from Florida.</p>
<p>In the spring of 1999, 38-year-old Roberta Johnson had a lot to look forward to.</p>
<p>The U.S. Army veteran had a job that she loved, working with at-risk children at a local school.</p>
<p>She was also nine months pregnant and would soon welcome a baby boy into the world.</p>
<p>And she was doing all of this while her teenage daughter was set to graduate high school in</p>
<p>the coming weeks.</p>
<p>But one April afternoon, all of that was taken from Roberta and her family when she vanished</p>
<p>from the parking lot of a grocery store and was brutally murdered.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Ashley Flowers, and this is The Deck.</p>
<p>It was a little before 11 a.m. on Saturday, April 24, 1999, and 17-year-old Arkeisha Johnson</p>
<p>was waiting for her mother to pick her up from Vanguard High School in Ocala, Florida,</p>
<p>which is a town in central Florida about 80 miles north of Orlando.</p>
<p>Arkeisha was just weeks away from graduating, but she had spent that Saturday morning in</p>
<p>detention for mouthing off to a teacher the previous week.</p>
<p>It was no big deal, really.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;d spend a couple of hours in so-called Saturday school, and then her mom, Roberta,</p>
<p>with whom she was extremely close, would pick her up at around 1045 after running some errands.</p>
<p>But 1045 had come and gone, and there was no sign of Roberta.</p>
<p>Arkeisha thought, okay, it&rsquo;s Saturday, she&rsquo;s out running errands, she probably lost track</p>
<p>of time or something.</p>
<p>But when even more time passed and her mom still hadn&rsquo;t shown up, Arkeisha was really</p>
<p>starting to worry.</p>
<p>I mean, her mom was usually extremely punctual and regimented, her daily routines guided</p>
<p>by a strict adherence to plans and appointments.</p>
<p>So Arkeisha walked over to her grandmother&rsquo;s house, it was her mom&rsquo;s mom, and the house</p>
<p>was just down the street from the high school.</p>
<p>Now, her grandmother told her that she had last talked to Roberta a couple of hours before,</p>
<p>maybe at like 925 or so when they spoke on the phone in between Roberta&rsquo;s errands.</p>
<p>That conversation was only a couple of minutes long, and Roberta mentioned something about</p>
<p>having an appointment at 10 that morning, but she hadn&rsquo;t mentioned who she was meeting</p>
<p>at 10 or where it was taking place.</p>
<p>So Arkeisha called her boyfriend Sidney next, because he had actually been in the car with</p>
<p>them that morning when Arkeisha was dropped off at school.</p>
<p>Roberta said that she was just gonna drop Sidney off at his house after.</p>
<p>Over the phone, Sidney confirmed that her mom had in fact dropped him back at his house</p>
<p>at around 8 that morning.</p>
<p>After hanging up, Arkeisha and Sidney met up again.</p>
<p>Arkeisha decided to go back to their apartment to double check that her mom hadn&rsquo;t gotten</p>
<p>back from running errands and just fallen asleep on the couch or something, but when</p>
<p>she and Sidney pulled up to the complex, there was no sign of Roberta&rsquo;s car in the parking</p>
<p>lot, and when they got inside, she wasn&rsquo;t there either.</p>
<p>Roberta was officially worried at this point, and so was the rest of the family.</p>
<p>So Arkeisha started working the phones, calling everyone who might have interacted with her</p>
<p>mom that day, but it wasn&rsquo;t a very long list.</p>
<p>Several relatives who also lived in Ocala said that they had not seen or heard from</p>
<p>Roberta that morning, but they were also worried and agreed to help look for her.</p>
<p>Roberta&rsquo;s family spent the rest of the afternoon making calls and looking for her around town.</p>
<p>The anxiety was running especially high because Roberta was nine months pregnant and literally</p>
<p>just days away from delivering a child.</p>
<p>With that in mind, family members also checked area hospitals to see if she&rsquo;d been admitted,</p>
<p>maybe she was in a hospital room somewhere.</p>
<p>But that was a bust after hospital officials told family members that Roberta was not under</p>
<p>their care.</p>
<p>Arkeisha and a cohort of friends and family continued their search for Roberta through</p>
<p>the rest of the day, but as evening approached, Arkeisha was unsure what to do next.</p>
<p>So she and Sidney returned to his place where his mom was preparing a late dinner.</p>
<p>The thing is, his mom was missing a key ingredient for whatever it was she was making, and so</p>
<p>the teenagers offered to make a quick grocery run at a nearby Winn-Dixie.</p>
<p>It was a brief but welcome distraction.</p>
<p>Arkeisha and Sidney pulled into the store parking lot at around 9 or 9.30 that night,</p>
<p>and right away something caught their eye that made their hearts race.</p>
<p>Sidney pointed into the distance to a white four-door sedan.</p>
<p>It looked just like Roberta&rsquo;s car.</p>
<p>They parked behind it and jumped out to take a closer look.</p>
<p>This was it.</p>
<p>This was her mom&rsquo;s car, but there was no sign of Roberta.</p>
<p>Now this was all the evidence Arkeisha needed to know that her mom was in trouble.</p>
<p>So she immediately called police.</p>
<p>The parking lot was soon swarming with a mix of Roberta&rsquo;s relatives and the blue and</p>
<p>red hues of squad cars.</p>
<p>As authorities scoped out the scene and did their best to see through the darkness with</p>
<p>their flashlights, an officer caught a glimpse of something small and metallic on a grassy</p>
<p>median.</p>
<p>There, on the ground about five or six feet from the driver&rsquo;s side door, were Roberta&rsquo;s</p>
<p>keys.</p>
<p>With that discovery, the search for Roberta became a lot more urgent.</p>
<p>Officers secured and impounded the car and also requested surveillance footage from</p>
<p>the grocery store.</p>
<p>But unfortunately, the footage wasn&rsquo;t helpful.</p>
<p>The grocery store&rsquo;s cameras were rolling, but Roberta wasn&rsquo;t captured by any of the</p>
<p>cameras that were trained on the parking lot.</p>
<p>For two days, law enforcement officials scoured the city looking for any sign of the missing</p>
<p>woman who, again, was nine months pregnant.</p>
<p>Which brings the officers, and I&rsquo;m sure you, to one question.</p>
<p>Who is the baby&rsquo;s father?</p>
<p>Did Roberta have a partner?</p>
<p>Well, Roberta&rsquo;s family said, yes, Roberta was technically married to a man named Arthur</p>
<p>Johnson.</p>
<p>But she was only married to him in a legal sense.</p>
<p>They were estranged from one another.</p>
<p>And in fact, he didn&rsquo;t even live in the area and her family said he definitely wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>the father of her child.</p>
<p>But they did believe that they know who was.</p>
<p>Family members told detectives that though she never sought a paternity test, Roberta</p>
<p>insisted to her daughter that a man named Drayton Florence was the father of her soon-to-be</p>
<p>baby boy.</p>
<p>If the name Drayton Florence sounds familiar to you, you&rsquo;re probably an NFL fan and are</p>
<p>thinking of a cornerback by the same name.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s Drayton Florence Jr.</p>
<p>And that NFL cornerback is actually the son of the guy we&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>Anyway, Drayton was an army recruiter based in Ocala who&rsquo;d recruited Roberta years earlier.</p>
<p>The two had struck up a friendship and remained close in the years after, like more than just</p>
<p>friends close.</p>
<p>Arkeisha said that after some time, Drayton Sr. and her mother began a casual relationship</p>
<p>that lasted for years.</p>
<p>She also told our reporter that she would see Drayton around the apartment from time</p>
<p>to time and that her mother was forthright about the fact that they were more or less</p>
<p>a thing.</p>
<p>But Drayton never came into the apartment.</p>
<p>He and Roberta would simply hang out near the outside of their place.</p>
<p>So police knew that they needed to track down both Arthur and Drayton, but the most important</p>
<p>thing was still finding Roberta.</p>
<p>As the second day of searching began, Ocala police detective Mike Balkin was helping canvas</p>
<p>the area, starting in the parking lot where Roberta&rsquo;s car was found and then fanning out</p>
<p>to surrounding neighborhoods.</p>
<p>He also had his eye on nearby lesser developed parts of the city that were dense with shrubbery</p>
<p>and fields, which was how he came upon a blink-and-you-could-miss-it dirt road just off of Northwest 44th Avenue.</p>
<p>This was just about three miles from the Winn-Dixie.</p>
<p>Marion County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office Detective Daniel Pinder, who is the lead on the case today,</p>
<p>described this place as having a sort of lover&rsquo;s lane reputation among locals.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t that developed.</p>
<p>There were housing, but aside from that, it was open green fields and then some very dense</p>
<p>and heavy trees.</p>
<p>It was like a place where somebody might pull off the side of the road to do something that</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t want other people to see.</p>
<p>There was discarded beer bottles.</p>
<p>There was discarded car parts and just general junk.</p>
<p>As Detective Balkin followed the dirt road, something caught his eye.</p>
<p>Exiting his cruiser, he saw what appeared to be a detached Chevy car hood laid across</p>
<p>a bunch of loose dirt.</p>
<p>It was clear that the hood was covering something, but he couldn&rsquo;t tell what exactly.</p>
<p>By the looks of it, the detective wasn&rsquo;t going to be able to access whatever was beneath</p>
<p>that car hood alone, so he called for backup.</p>
<p>In addition to the other officers from Ocala PD, some deputies from the Marion County Sheriff&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Office were also dispatched.</p>
<p>The Sheriff&rsquo;s Office investigators actually took the lead since this site was in an unincorporated</p>
<p>county and in their jurisdiction.</p>
<p>Crime scene technicians and investigators worked together to lift the heavy car hood.</p>
<p>Based on the freshly disturbed earth and the amount of surface area the dirt was covering,</p>
<p>there was no doubt in their minds.</p>
<p>Something or someone was right below the ground.</p>
<p>Now because law enforcement had to be extra mindful as not to disturb a potential crime</p>
<p>scene, Detective Pinder said that the process was a painstaking one, and it took hours.</p>
<p>When excavations are done, it&rsquo;s done via sifting.</p>
<p>So whenever a scoop of dirt is removed, it&rsquo;s then moved to a sifter.</p>
<p>This allows to make sure that we&rsquo;re not missing anything.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why it takes several hours to go through the dirt because it all has to</p>
<p>be scooped and then sifted and then slowly gone through.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want to just dig and you might strike something of value.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a slow process of sifting and going through evidence.</p>
<p>After at least six hours of scooping and sifting and scooping and sifting, authorities made</p>
<p>a truly horrific discovery.</p>
<p>Lying there in a shallow grave no deeper than two or three feet was the body of a visibly</p>
<p>pregnant woman.</p>
<p>Since she&rsquo;d been underground, it was hard to tell how she died.</p>
<p>But investigators did see obvious wounds on the top and back of the woman&rsquo;s head.</p>
<p>This woman&rsquo;s body showed few signs of decomposition, which signaled that she&rsquo;d likely been killed</p>
<p>and buried very recently.</p>
<p>She was also wearing the same clothes that family members had said Roberta was wearing</p>
<p>the morning that she was last seen, a white T-shirt and purple shorts.</p>
<p>Something that stood out to authorities, though, was the fact that she wasn&rsquo;t wearing the</p>
<p>white canvas tennis shoes that she was last seen in, which were nowhere to be found.</p>
<p>Investigators processed this area, but ultimately came up with very little by means of possible</p>
<p>evidence.</p>
<p>No weapon, no blood, and that made investigators think that this area had just been a dump</p>
<p>site and that the murder actually took place somewhere else.</p>
<p>Because the area was down a secluded dirt road, there weren&rsquo;t many canvassing options,</p>
<p>so police didn&rsquo;t come up with any witnesses right away.</p>
<p>By the next day, all they had for potential evidence was the loose dirt and soil that</p>
<p>had been disturbed around the woman, and a set of partial tire tracks.</p>
<p>There were also some fingerprints that were lifted from the car hood, but they didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>turn up any matches in APHIS or anywhere else.</p>
<p>The sheriff&rsquo;s department dispatched a detective early that evening to Arkeisha&rsquo;s place,</p>
<p>where her entire extended family had gathered.</p>
<p>They delivered the news that the woman they found was likely her mother.</p>
<p>Arkeisha, who, again, was just 17 at the time, spoke to our team about that day.</p>
<p>All I know is I was told that, you know, my mom wasn&rsquo;t, my mom wasn&rsquo;t living anymore.</p>
<p>And I didn&rsquo;t believe it, I didn&rsquo;t want to believe it, I guess I was in shock, maybe.</p>
<p>The following morning, family members formally identified the woman as Roberta, the 38-year-old</p>
<p>Army veteran who was on the verge of delivering a child died of blunt force trauma to the</p>
<p>head, and her death was ruled a homicide.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s worth noting there was no indication that Roberta had been sexually assaulted.</p>
<p>So now that authorities knew for certain that they were staring down a murder investigation,</p>
<p>deputies took a closer look at Roberta&rsquo;s car and processed it for potential evidence</p>
<p>that could be tied to her murder.</p>
<p>Detective Pinder said they recovered some fingerprints in and on her vehicle, as well</p>
<p>as miscellaneous fibers and debris, things like dirt, sand, other little bits of foliage.</p>
<p>All of it was preserved in hopes of being used in the future to try and compare them</p>
<p>against honestly anything.</p>
<p>But nothing about the car really stood out.</p>
<p>That is, except for where it was found and the fact that her keys were so close by.</p>
<p>That made investigators wonder if Roberta had encountered her killer right there in</p>
<p>the Winn-Dixie parking lot.</p>
<p>With a lack of physical evidence, deputies investigating her murder quickly realized</p>
<p>that they were going to have to lean hard on potential witnesses and people who knew</p>
<p>her if they were going to make any progress in this case.</p>
<p>Authorities spoke with Roberta&rsquo;s loved ones and tried to find anyone who might have information</p>
<p>to offer about Roberta&rsquo;s final hours.</p>
<p>They also wanted to know if there was anyone who might have wanted to harm her because</p>
<p>So far, her murder seemed to lack a motive.</p>
<p>Through interviews with her family members, deputies learned that Roberta was well-liked</p>
<p>in the community and was known for her signature bright smile and outgoing personality.</p>
<p>Or if you ask our Keisha, Roberta was fierce and kick-ass.</p>
<p>Everybody loved my mom.</p>
<p>Like, there was no reason for anybody to do anything to her.</p>
<p>I mean, all she did was help people.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>Like, she was well-known in the community.</p>
<p>She always had, like, a serious look on her face, but she was a very genuine and caring</p>
<p>person.</p>
<p>And there was no reason for anybody to do what they did to her.</p>
<p>Roberta had a degree in criminal justice and a deep passion for working with children.</p>
<p>Aside from her work as a case manager where she counseled at-risk youth, she was also</p>
<p>a substitute teacher in the public school system.</p>
<p>As they learned more and more about Roberta, Detective Pinder said they started to wonder</p>
<p>how anyone could have it out for someone so widely touted as a kind and compassionate</p>
<p>person.</p>
<p>We weren&rsquo;t getting tips that she was having conflicts with people.</p>
<p>She wasn&rsquo;t somebody that was getting in constant fights or had problems or beefs with</p>
<p>people in the community.</p>
<p>There wasn&rsquo;t many tips that would lead to anything regarding that avenue.</p>
<p>She wasn&rsquo;t a person that had conflicts like that.</p>
<p>With no obvious suspect coming to light, the best they could do was work to track down</p>
<p>Roberta&rsquo;s husband, Arthur.</p>
<p>Like I mentioned earlier, he didn&rsquo;t live in town.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;d relocated to Tampa, which is a solid hour and a half drive from Ocala.</p>
<p>When they found him, he told police that he&rsquo;d been there for that whole two-day stretch</p>
<p>in which officials were searching for Roberta, who almost certainly died on April 24th, the</p>
<p>last time she was seen.</p>
<p>So with him having a pretty solid alibi, up next, they wanted to talk to Drayton.</p>
<p>But before they could track him down, something happened that police thought could deliver</p>
<p>them a break in the case.</p>
<p>A transient man showed up at the police department.</p>
<p>He had seen flyers and news reports about the murder, and he had something to give to</p>
<p>police.</p>
<p>It was Roberta&rsquo;s purse.</p>
<p>Detectives interviewed this man who said that he had found the purse discarded beneath an</p>
<p>overpass where he spent a lot of time.</p>
<p>Inside were personal items that had Roberta&rsquo;s name on them, like pieces of mail and her</p>
<p>driver&rsquo;s license.</p>
<p>The man told investigators that he immediately recognized Roberta&rsquo;s name and walked to a</p>
<p>nearby restaurant where he used the phone to call 911 and report what he found.</p>
<p>Investigators worked to clear this man as well and learned that he spent the day Roberta</p>
<p>went missing at a Salvation Army hub where employees all vouched for him.</p>
<p>Now, this purse was promising, no doubt, and it did give police a new avenue to explore</p>
<p>because this overpass was like two miles from where her car and keys were found.</p>
<p>This gave them a whole new set of questions.</p>
<p>Had Roberta been there, or did her killer just discard her purse there after the murder?</p>
<p>And honestly, this purse also gave police their first possible motive, robbery.</p>
<p>But as they were exploring those possibilities, a witness came forward that made it more pressing</p>
<p>than ever for them to track down and talk to Drayton.</p>
<p>This witness said that she saw Roberta arguing with someone in a convenience store parking</p>
<p>lot the day before she disappeared.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not clear what time this happened or if this was the same store parking lot that</p>
<p>her car was found in the next day.</p>
<p>But according to an article in the Florida Times Union, the woman told detectives that</p>
<p>she observed a man who was shouting and waving a fist in the air at a pregnant woman.</p>
<p>Now, we don&rsquo;t know the exact description of the man the witness gave to detectives</p>
<p>all those years ago, but Arkesha told our team that whatever that description was, she</p>
<p>just remembers that at the time they thought it sounded an awful lot like Drayton Florence</p>
<p>Sr.</p>
<p>And according to what Arkesha told our reporting team, the witness later picked him out of</p>
<p>a photo lineup.</p>
<p>Assuming for a minute that the child Roberta was carrying was Drayton&rsquo;s, it wasn&rsquo;t clear</p>
<p>to Arkesha how Drayton felt about welcoming another kid with someone who wasn&rsquo;t his wife.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Drayton was married to another woman and had a whole family of his own outside of whatever</p>
<p>relationship he had with Roberta.</p>
<p>And on top of that, according to the Times Union report, Drayton Sr. had also fathered</p>
<p>two other children outside of his marriage.</p>
<p>Within a week of Roberta&rsquo;s body being found, and after all of this was conveyed to authorities,</p>
<p>deputies reached out to Drayton and he agreed to sit down for an interview.</p>
<p>At first, he was cooperative and told authorities that he&rsquo;d seen Roberta recently, actually.</p>
<p>Detective Pinder wouldn&rsquo;t say exactly how recently, but we do know from the Times Union</p>
<p>article that they met up at some point, could be as recently as Friday, the day before she</p>
<p>was killed.</p>
<p>Drayton went on to provide a basic timeline of his whereabouts for the weekend leading</p>
<p>up to Roberta&rsquo;s disappearance.</p>
<p>Drayton indicated that he was at work on the morning of April 24th.</p>
<p>That was the day that Roberta went missing.</p>
<p>And he said that colleagues would be able to back him up, vouch for him, basically.</p>
<p>But there were holes in Drayton&rsquo;s story.</p>
<p>And after his initial interview, detectives were left with honestly more questions than</p>
<p>answers.</p>
<p>For example, although his employer did confirm Drayton was at work that day, his colleagues</p>
<p>told authorities that it would have been easy for him to slip out at any point without being</p>
<p>noticed.</p>
<p>Drayton told investigators in that first and only interview that he and Roberta did not</p>
<p>have any kind of conflict or beef in the days leading up to her disappearance.</p>
<p>Then after that interview, he hired an attorney who declined any additional conversations</p>
<p>with law enforcement on his client&rsquo;s behalf.</p>
<p>So by now, Drayton was absolutely a person of interest in the eyes of law enforcement.</p>
<p>And his reluctance to further cooperate with investigators only seemed to motivate detectives.</p>
<p>And what they found out about Drayton&rsquo;s activities the week of Roberta&rsquo;s murder cast an even</p>
<p>darker cloud of suspicion over the army recruiter.</p>
<p>According to reporting from the Times Union newspaper, in the days after being questioned</p>
<p>by police, Drayton returned to work and asked multiple colleagues to switch cars with him.</p>
<p>One of them agreed, and the two flip-flopped their cars.</p>
<p>And detectives actually caught on to this when they sought to corroborate the timeline</p>
<p>Drayton provided to them in his interview.</p>
<p>So law enforcement obviously went and tracked down Drayton&rsquo;s original car and processed</p>
<p>it for potential evidence.</p>
<p>And they found something wild.</p>
<p>Forensic techs recovered traces of amniotic fluid in at least one portion of the car&rsquo;s</p>
<p>interior.</p>
<p>Now, for those of you who don&rsquo;t know, amniotic fluid acts as sort of a protective layer that</p>
<p>surrounds a fetus.</p>
<p>So when a woman&rsquo;s water breaks, it&rsquo;s actually amniotic fluid that&rsquo;s discharged.</p>
<p>Now Detective Pinder declined to comment on this, but Arkeisha confirmed that she was</p>
<p>told by law enforcement that this was the case.</p>
<p>They did find this.</p>
<p>Now the story from the Times Union didn&rsquo;t note where in the car that the fluid traces</p>
<p>were detected.</p>
<p>But Arkeisha said that she was under the impression it was found in the back seat, along with</p>
<p>miscellaneous traces of dirt and some leaves that were also collected.</p>
<p>Detectives have tried repeatedly to re-interview Drayton, but he&rsquo;s rebuffed all of their requests.</p>
<p>He also relocated to the Jacksonville area soon after Roberta&rsquo;s murder, which obviously</p>
<p>made it trickier for law enforcement to keep tabs on him.</p>
<p>Though Drayton continues to be considered a person of interest in this investigation,</p>
<p>he has maintained that he did not have anything to do with Roberta&rsquo;s murder.</p>
<p>He even went on record with a reporter from the Times Union in July of 2010.</p>
<p>He said, quote, I know I didn&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>It was troubling to me also.</p>
<p>She was my friend, end quote.</p>
<p>Arkeisha told our team that she always remained suspicious of Drayton and that she hasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>seen or heard from him in years.</p>
<p>Well, that is until 2015.</p>
<p>You see, every year there&rsquo;s this block party style event that celebrates local class reunions.</p>
<p>Arkeisha said that she always avoided the event because she knew Drayton had ties to</p>
<p>the area schools and was anxious at the possibility of even running into him.</p>
<p>But in 2015, she and a cousin decided to go anyway.</p>
<p>And soon after they arrived, they saw him.</p>
<p>Arkeisha described the sight of him as having prompted a full body visceral reaction, but</p>
<p>she approached him.</p>
<p>I walked right into him, like we were face to face.</p>
<p>And I asked him, I said, do you know who I am?</p>
<p>And he was like, no, I don&rsquo;t know who you are.</p>
<p>I was like, you sure?</p>
<p>I was like, I&rsquo;m Roberta&rsquo;s daughter.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t know who I am?</p>
<p>And he said, no, I don&rsquo;t know who you are.</p>
<p>And I said, Roberta Johnson, I said, you killed my mother.</p>
<p>According to Arkeisha, Drayton then told her that he, quote unquote, didn&rsquo;t remember a</p>
<p>woman named Roberta Johnson.</p>
<p>At which point, Arkeisha became incensed.</p>
<p>I was like, you don&rsquo;t know who I am?</p>
<p>And he said to me, I don&rsquo;t remember her.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what he said to me, that he doesn&rsquo;t, he doesn&rsquo;t, he said he doesn&rsquo;t remember my</p>
<p>mom.</p>
<p>And I went, I lost it.</p>
<p>I went red.</p>
<p>And it was really bad, like, it was really bad.</p>
<p>And then we had a verbal altercation, and his son got involved, and his wife got involved.</p>
<p>And at some point in it all, his wife grabbed my hands, and she grabbed me.</p>
<p>And she says, why don&rsquo;t you just let this shit go?</p>
<p>Your mom is dead now.</p>
<p>Arkeisha said that after the woman grabbed her, she pushed her off, which later prompted</p>
<p>the woman to try and get Arkeisha charged with assault, but nothing ever came of it.</p>
<p>Arkeisha also told our team that she felt as if the scales were tipped against her family</p>
<p>from the very beginning.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t come from a lot of money, you know what I mean?</p>
<p>My mom, she was just a regular working person, and then she was a black woman.</p>
<p>And I just feel like the type of publicity, maybe like that Lacey Peterson guy, my mom</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t get.</p>
<p>And, you know, the resources that maybe we could have had if we had more money weren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>available to us at the time.</p>
<p>And also, like, as the years went by, his son went on to play professional football.</p>
<p>And so that brought them into even more money, which gave them more resources to be able</p>
<p>to have better lawyers for whatever the case may be.</p>
<p>Detective Pinder said this case is 100% solvable, and that more than anything, investigators</p>
<p>are still eager to interview Drayton again.</p>
<p>I would hope to rediscuss his timeline of that day.</p>
<p>I think any investigator that had this case would really like to learn a little bit more</p>
<p>past his initial statements regarding his timeline, especially since so many man hours</p>
<p>have been put in by all the other investigators in this case regarding his comings and goings</p>
<p>that day.</p>
<p>And Drayton Florence&rsquo;s previous statements to law enforcement and his specific whereabouts</p>
<p>aren&rsquo;t the only thing Detective Pinder wants to revisit.</p>
<p>He told our team that he has begun retesting fingerprints this year from both the car hood</p>
<p>that was covering Roberta&rsquo;s body, as well as the prints recovered from the interior</p>
<p>and exterior of her sedan.</p>
<p>And still, more than two decades later, the results have yet to point to anyone in particular.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s unclear whether that means the prints themselves were not good enough to</p>
<p>generate a match, or they just weren&rsquo;t returning hits, period.</p>
<p>And Detective Pinder declined to say anything more about the fingerprints other than they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>continuing to try and retest them.</p>
<p>In the two plus decades Roberta has been gone, Arkeisha has navigated countless milestones</p>
<p>and special occasions without her mom, without her closest confidant by her side.</p>
<p>That included Arkeisha&rsquo;s wedding, and the birth and upbringing of her own daughter,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s now the same age Arkeisha was when Roberta was killed.</p>
<p>Arkeisha also told our team that she&rsquo;s since rekindled a relationship with her father,</p>
<p>whom she and her daughter are close with.</p>
<p>Every time I think that I&rsquo;m getting stronger as the years go by, I don&rsquo;t know, I always</p>
<p>end up still feeling so weak.</p>
<p>I just, I miss her.</p>
<p>I miss her so much.</p>
<p>I miss her so much.</p>
<p>I miss her so much.</p>
<p>I just, I always wonder, like, how, how, how our relationship will be, and, like, will</p>
<p>we have a, a set day that we would do dinner, or, you know, like, during the week, you know,</p>
<p>or every month we would get our nails done together, just, I just wonder how my life</p>
<p>would be if, if my mom was still here.</p>
<p>I just really miss her.</p>
<p>I want people to, to remember my mom for the life that she lived and not, not how she died.</p>
<p>I want people to know that she would literally get the shirt off of her back, and I want</p>
<p>people to know that she was very, very smart, very, very educated.</p>
<p>There wasn&rsquo;t anything that she couldn&rsquo;t figure out, you know, and I want them to know that</p>
<p>I love her, and I miss her, and I just, I wake up every day hoping that she&rsquo;s, she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>proud of the person that I&rsquo;ve become, and I hate the fact that, you know, she, she never</p>
<p>got a chance to, to meet my daughter.</p>
<p>If you have any information about the April 1999 murder of Roberta Johnson and her unborn</p>
<p>child, or maybe you have additional insight into her relationship with Drayton Florence</p>
<p>Sr., or maybe Drayton himself is listening right now, you are asked to contact Marion</p>
<p>County Sheriff&rsquo;s Detective Daniel Pinder at 352-368-3508.</p>
