    <p>The following is a conversation with Josh Barnett,</p>
<p>one of the greatest fighters</p>
<p>and submission wrestlers in history,</p>
<p>with an epic 25 year career</p>
<p>that includes being the UFC heavyweight champion</p>
<p>and countless other accolades.</p>
<p>He also happens to be one of the most intelligent</p>
<p>and brutally honest human beings in all of martial arts,</p>
<p>and especially so about his appreciation of</p>
<p>and fascination with violence.</p>

<p>As a side note, let me say that I&rsquo;ve been a fan</p>
<p>of Josh Barnett for a long time.</p>
<p>This conversation was indeed a long time coming,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;ll talk many times again.</p>
<p>For what it&rsquo;s worth, I&rsquo;m a student of combat sports</p>
<p>and admire when they&rsquo;re done at the highest level,</p>
<p>either through masterful execution of skill</p>
<p>or relentless dominance of pure guts.</p>
<p>For context, I&rsquo;m a black belt in Jiu Jitsu</p>
<p>and have competed in wrestling, submission grappling,</p>
<p>Jiu Jitsu, Judo, and even catch wrestling,</p>
<p>which is a variant of submission grappling</p>
<p>that Josh is one of the great practitioners,</p>
<p>scholars and teachers of.</p>
<p>I could probably talk for hours</p>
<p>about what I&rsquo;ve learned from my time on the mat,</p>
<p>but if I were to say one thing,</p>
<p>it is that the mat is honest.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t run away from yourself when you step on the mat.</p>
<p>It reveals your fears, the lies you might tell yourself,</p>
<p>all the delusions you might have, or at least I had,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s anything in this world that can be achieved</p>
<p>except through blood, sweat, and tears.</p>
<p>That honesty, taken to the highest levels,</p>
<p>as is the case with Josh,</p>
<p>creates the most special of human beings</p>
<p>and definitely someone who is fascinating to talk to.</p>

<p>And now, here&rsquo;s my conversation with Josh Barnett.</p>
<p>Who were the philosophers and philosophical ideas</p>
<p>that influenced you the most?</p>
<p>Are we just jumping right in?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it. We&rsquo;re right in.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not, no foreplay on camera, all right.</p>
<p>I had an interesting philosophical journey,</p>
<p>at least I think it&rsquo;s interesting,</p>
<p>and that was, I think, as far as organized philosophy</p>
<p>or maybe, authentic&rsquo;s not the right word,</p>
<p>but like, yeah, we&rsquo;ll say organized.</p>
<p>I would say that Nietzsche is probably one of the people</p>
<p>with the most influence on me,</p>
<p>but I also feel like, to a degree,</p>
<p>your personality will oftentimes dictate</p>
<p>what philosophers that you can vibe with, yeah.</p>
<p>So what ideas from Nietzsche, was it the Ubermensch?</p>
<p>Definitely the Ubermensch is huge to me</p>
<p>because I see it as an extension</p>
<p>of basically the religious concepts of God</p>
<p>and higher ideals,</p>
<p>but just put into a different, a secular context.</p>
<p>And the idea also that the Ubermensch is striving</p>
<p>and overcoming something that you&rsquo;re always working towards</p>
<p>that very few will ever,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not like the concept that you can just make them.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t happen that way.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not based simply upon if you were, say,</p>
<p>put through a genetic program</p>
<p>and turned into a super soldier,</p>
<p>like that wouldn&rsquo;t make it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like the very surface level</p>
<p>and incorrect understanding of what the Ubermensch is.</p>
<p>The Ubermensch is the idea of this kind of human</p>
<p>that transcends all the weaker, lower aspects of humans,</p>
<p>which we&rsquo;re full of.</p>
<p>But I also think that there&rsquo;s an element in Nietzsche&rsquo;s</p>
<p>writing that suggests that it&rsquo;s not something</p>
<p>you can even be in all the time.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s even a temporary state</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not something</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re capable of maintaining.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s something to strive for.</p>
<p>Like a morality, an image, an ideal, a set of principles</p>
<p>that we can connect to that doesn&rsquo;t rely on</p>
<p>otherworldly kind of out there things.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s deeply human.</p>
<p>With Nietzsche, I feel like the concept of the Ubermensch</p>
<p>is something built on authenticity as well.</p>
<p>Heidegger was like Dasein, right?</p>
<p>So when you are authentic</p>
<p>and Heidegger being a follower of Nietzsche&rsquo;s</p>
<p>and highly influenced by him,</p>
<p>I think that the Ubermensch is an example of authenticity</p>
<p>in that it isn&rsquo;t about trying to be anything</p>
<p>that you cannot be or to go against who you are,</p>
<p>but to actually understand that, accept that,</p>
<p>and then work with what you can work with</p>
<p>and create from your lump of clay that is you.</p>
<p>Because I can&rsquo;t become&hellip;</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s certain things that are just not gonna happen</p>
<p>for me because it&rsquo;s not in my proclivity.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m never gonna be five foot tall</p>
<p>and 120 pounds, I mean, that again, I guess.</p>
<p>But I know, as you get more in tune with who you are,</p>
<p>as you start learning more about what unique things</p>
<p>or at least what that combination that makes you,</p>
<p>that gestalt part of yourself,</p>
<p>what those things are and how you can use them,</p>
<p>then you can work towards being that,</p>
<p>taking what that is and seeing if you can</p>
<p>get to that point.</p>
<p>Now, the likelihood is, no, maybe, probably never.</p>
<p>I mean, but we can never achieve Godhood yet.</p>
<p>Religion is a constant striving</p>
<p>and a look at a higher ideal concept.</p>
<p>Even if it&rsquo;s multiple gods or one God,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s still essentially all built around this concept.</p>
<p>I like the idea of Catholics original sin.</p>
<p>If you think of sin, not as evil,</p>
<p>but as missing the mark, the archer&rsquo;s term where it derives,</p>
<p>or even like in Spanish,</p>
<p>you know, without.</p>
<p>So as being, if you accept that you are imperfect,</p>
<p>if you accept that you need to constantly strive</p>
<p>even against yourself,</p>
<p>because you will figure out the best ways</p>
<p>at which to submarine your own capabilities,</p>
<p>submarine your own dreams and wishes and whatever,</p>
<p>you will ruin them more than anything else.</p>
<p>And you will tell yourself that you ruined them on purpose</p>
<p>for a good reason, or you&rsquo;ll say that you&rsquo;ll figure out</p>
<p>a way to put it on everything else but yourself.</p>
<p>And so the idea of thinking of,</p>
<p>well, as I&rsquo;m starting off on this whole thing,</p>
<p>I got a lot of work to do, and that&rsquo;s just the way it is.</p>
<p>And I gotta figure out what areas those are gonna be.</p>
<p>And so, you know, I thought, oh yeah,</p>
<p>if I think of original sin actually can be,</p>
<p>that can be kind of a clever idea,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also just accepting that</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re all uniquely strange and unequal in our own ways,</p>
<p>but we have to figure out how that fits in.</p>
<p>The word authenticity kind of connects to all of that.</p>
<p>So striving to be your authentic self means</p>
<p>figuring out exactly the shape of the flaws,</p>
<p>the character of your little demons that you get to play with</p>
<p>and around them finding a path to whatever the hell</p>
<p>ideal versions of yourself you can carve</p>
<p>and pretending like that&rsquo;s such a thing as even possible.</p>
<p>The other idea about Nietzsche is on his idea of morality.</p>
<p>He presents the argument that morality is a human illusion</p>
<p>and that there&rsquo;s not such a thing as good and evil,</p>
<p>and these are all kind of constructs.</p>
<p>Do you think there&rsquo;s such a thing as good and evil</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s connected to some objective reality?</p>
<p>I think that there are some,</p>
<p>I actually do believe that there are some universals.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not Kantian in any way,</p>
<p>but I do think that there are some universals.</p>
<p>And the thing that actually brought me</p>
<p>to even the concept of that was Jung.</p>
<p>So Jung&rsquo;s concept of collective unconsciousness</p>
<p>and then taking that thought</p>
<p>and then applying it to looking through history</p>
<p>and the most varied history you can find.</p>
<p>So I would say probably religion is your earliest one</p>
<p>that you can get for written history</p>
<p>or written examples of human behavior and psychology</p>
<p>at the furthest that we can look into it from man&rsquo;s hand</p>
<p>to whatever the medium is, cuneiform or whatever.</p>
<p>But as you do that, and then let&rsquo;s say going</p>
<p>from Mesopotamia to India to Europe</p>
<p>and just going from all these places,</p>
<p>as disparate as they may seem,</p>
<p>as many different cultures and ethnicities and religions</p>
<p>and how the religions will vary quite a bit</p>
<p>from monotheist to polytheist and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>But then just seeing how there&rsquo;s all the through lines.</p>
<p>And of course, Campbell, he did this</p>
<p>much earlier than me thinking about it.</p>
<p>But I think that by looking at things that way</p>
<p>and starting to find the threads</p>
<p>instead of always just looking at everything</p>
<p>as being its own compartmentalized concept</p>
<p>as if it only applies to this time, this people,</p>
<p>like getting overly pomo about it</p>
<p>is just a really idiotic postmodern.</p>
<p>So you think that there is, just like with Joseph Campbell,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a thread that connects all of these stories,</p>
<p>narratives that we constructed for ourselves as we evolve.</p>
<p>And that thread is grounded in some kind of absolute ideas</p>
<p>of maybe on the morality side,</p>
<p>which is the trickiest one of good and evil.</p>
<p>Somewhat, yeah, I think that a lot of this stuff</p>
<p>is just derived from a biological perspective.</p>
<p>I feel like these things are innate within us.</p>
<p>Do you think our innately humans are good?</p>
<p>No, I don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I feel like, I also feel like there&rsquo;s the issue of scale too.</p>
<p>Like Nassim Taleb likes to talk about how he views his,</p>
<p>the way he interacts with groups in terms of scale.</p>
<p>What is this thing about like at the familial level,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a communist and then at the civic level,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a Republican or something.</p>
<p>And at this other level,</p>
<p>and then it goes on at the widest level,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a libertarian or something of that nature.</p>
<p>Like fundamentally human interaction changes.</p>
<p>On scale. On scale.</p>
<p>And scale and also from subjective</p>
<p>to the environment around them.</p>
<p>So, and I don&rsquo;t even mean environment</p>
<p>just in the sake of physical environment, nature, right?</p>
<p>Like nature is constantly trying to murder you.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s not really trying.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just nature&rsquo;s being nature.</p>
<p>The universe is the universe.</p>
<p>And at times it takes you out.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just not with any particular compunction or prejudice.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, oops, you know, sorry, there&rsquo;s no more dodos.</p>
<p>My bad.</p>
<p>But don&rsquo;t you think the particular flavor</p>
<p>of the complexity that is the human mind was created,</p>
<p>like let me make an argument</p>
<p>for that all people are fundamentally good.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Is there&rsquo;s an evolutionary advantage</p>
<p>to being, to striving to cooperate,</p>
<p>to add more love to the world of like compassion, empathy,</p>
<p>all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>And that the very thing that created the human mind</p>
<p>was this evolutionary advantage,</p>
<p>whatever the forces behind this evolutionary advantage.</p>
<p>And scale, yes.</p>
<p>So when we&rsquo;re dealing with a small tribe, sure.</p>
<p>When you meet another tribe, maybe.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s other factors that are going into that.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say you scale up.</p>
<p>And so your 150 has exceeded their 150.</p>
<p>And like, you start to get to a certain point</p>
<p>where you can&rsquo;t really be close enough</p>
<p>to someone down the line of some of that next,</p>
<p>like that 150 is 150, 150.</p>
<p>And they just now all of a sudden become some guy, whatever.</p>
<p>And when it comes to some guy, once it starts hitting scale,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know that it&rsquo;s capable.</p>
<p>People can be as magnanimous to a stranger as to the known.</p>
<p>If they orient themselves to be secure enough,</p>
<p>because it does come to security, insecurity</p>
<p>in one way or the other, either brought on by the unknown,</p>
<p>brought on by an actual threat,</p>
<p>brought on by even their own,</p>
<p>as we would use the word insecurity in that</p>
<p>their own insecurity within their own capabilities,</p>
<p>their own belief in themselves,</p>
<p>all these things can change things</p>
<p>from being compassionate and what have you</p>
<p>to at least at the very least, maybe not evil,</p>
<p>but self interest driven to the point of a negative results</p>
<p>for those that aren&rsquo;t, you know what I mean?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>But another way to frame that is maybe it&rsquo;s less about scale</p>
<p>and more about the amount of resources available.</p>
<p>So if we&rsquo;re overflowing with resources</p>
<p>in terms of security and safety,</p>
<p>all the things you&rsquo;ve mentioned,</p>
<p>if we have more than enough resources,</p>
<p>then the way we treat a stranger,</p>
<p>the way we position ourselves towards that stranger</p>
<p>might be in a way that allows us to be our real human selves</p>
<p>as opposed to sort of our animal self.</p>
<p>And therefore it&rsquo;s mostly about</p>
<p>how clever can we descendants of Abe&rsquo;s be</p>
<p>in coming up with all cool kinds of technologies</p>
<p>and ways to efficiently use the resources we have</p>
<p>such that we&rsquo;re not constrained.</p>
<p>And my hope is that human innovation</p>
<p>will outpace the growth of our,</p>
<p>the number of people that are starving for resources.</p>
<p>Yes, I think that there&rsquo;s a lot of rationality</p>
<p>behind this argument.</p>
<p>And in some ways I agree and in a lot of ways</p>
<p>I see it as missing the point</p>
<p>of how this experiment has been playing out across time.</p>
<p>When you look at what, for one, it&rsquo;s like define resources.</p>
<p>What is a resource of as humans would define it, right?</p>
<p>Or wealth even.</p>
<p>And so you can say, well, an iPhone&rsquo;s a resource,</p>
<p>the internet&rsquo;s a resource, water obviously is a resource.</p>
<p>But if we weigh them, what is more important</p>
<p>to human beings, water, internet or iPhones?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s water, right?</p>
<p>So if we look at resources, if we start with</p>
<p>what do human beings need to live?</p>
<p>I mean, actually live, not live here</p>
<p>in this bullshit fantasy creation extension</p>
<p>of our own ingenuity and a prison of our own creation</p>
<p>and also a paradise of our own creation.</p>
<p>But this is not how human beings normally live.</p>
<p>This is all built upon stuff,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s built on concept, on idea and some of it&rsquo;s built</p>
<p>on just, well, this is the paradigm so this is what you do.</p>
<p>Human beings need food, they need water to survive,</p>
<p>they need shelter from the elements</p>
<p>and they need certain skills to perpetuate these things</p>
<p>and be able to pass them down so that they can,</p>
<p>so that these things don&rsquo;t become,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t end up in this gap where you have</p>
<p>to relearn things because if it&rsquo;s lost,</p>
<p>then that time before you can get it back again</p>
<p>is going to be dark ages of sorts</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s going to be highly detrimental to your group</p>
<p>because not knowing how to fish, not knowing how to hunt,</p>
<p>not knowing how to even clean and cook the game</p>
<p>once you have it could be lethal.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fascinating to think of that as a basic resource,</p>
<p>the knowledge to attain the very low level things of water.</p>
<p>Right, and we&rsquo;ll figure it out.</p>
<p>We did it once before and we&rsquo;ve done it over</p>
<p>and over and over and over again.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just costly.</p>
<p>Yes, it has costs for sure.</p>
<p>But when you think of how you look at the,</p>
<p>well, we&rsquo;ll just deal with the first world of the West.</p>
<p>You look at the pathway of Western civilization</p>
<p>and its growth and then you look at how technology</p>
<p>injected into it over time,</p>
<p>how it magnifies things or pushes things</p>
<p>at orders of magnitude faster</p>
<p>and then the internet comes along and even faster.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re watching industrial revolution to,</p>
<p>what is it, the capacitor and then so on.</p>
<p>It goes further and further.</p>
<p>And as the internet and technology,</p>
<p>especially on the electronic side of things,</p>
<p>start increasing in capability,</p>
<p>it massively outpaces even our necessity for it at times.</p>
<p>It becomes, you know, plant obsolescence happens quicker</p>
<p>and over and over and over again</p>
<p>and wealth increases, increases, increases, increases</p>
<p>in terms of the things that we&rsquo;re able to acquire, right?</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;ve seen homeless people with smartphones,</p>
<p>you know, so we&rsquo;re living in the most wealth laden,</p>
<p>luxury laden age of all of humanity yet.</p>
<p>What happens when we see calamity</p>
<p>or people go on hard time?</p>
<p>What are the things that they value?</p>
<p>You know, what do people go to an argument</p>
<p>about the cost of things that are luxury items generally</p>
<p>and not necessity items?</p>
<p>You know, we get into fights about things that are</p>
<p>at the end of the day, not necessities to us.</p>
<p>You know, people are so concerned about Netflix</p>
<p>and the internet and personally,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very concerned about the internet</p>
<p>because I look at it as my own little personal library</p>
<p>of Alexandria in my pocket.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I love about it.</p>
<p>And the ability to have a tool as effective as it is,</p>
<p>even though I&rsquo;m in a constant battle</p>
<p>to not let that tool become a vice</p>
<p>or to become something that actually</p>
<p>brings me to a lower state.</p>
<p>But are we willing, the question is over the,</p>
<p>are we willing to murder each other over Netflix</p>
<p>versus murder each other over water?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re willing to murder each other over water.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a given.</p>
<p>Right, but that&rsquo;s our animalistic selves.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s also a necessity for, it&rsquo;s animalistic,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also either you do it or you don&rsquo;t, right?</p>
<p>Like unless somebody&rsquo;s willing to share that water</p>
<p>or if that water is of such a limited capability</p>
<p>or such a limited amount,</p>
<p>then you will have to murder to have that water.</p>
<p>Netflix, the argument is the higher,</p>
<p>we get up to this hierarchy of what we consider</p>
<p>in Los Angeles resources,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re less willing to be, to commit violence.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re less willing to commit violence,</p>
<p>I would say over Netflix,</p>
<p>but we are willing to commit violence over Netflix,</p>
<p>over everything associated with Netflix,</p>
<p>over televisions, over sneakers,</p>
<p>over, you know, I mean, when we look at a good,</p>
<p>I mean, the majority of the stuff</p>
<p>that came with the riots,</p>
<p>I mean, it was used car dealerships, targets.</p>
<p>I mean, and then you look and it&rsquo;s like, well, okay,</p>
<p>well, what are people, what do they gotta,</p>
<p>what are they so hell bent to get out of this whole thing?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m even talking about the ideological elements</p>
<p>or anything like that.</p>
<p>Just like, okay, something&rsquo;s going on,</p>
<p>boom, looting, whatever, you know,</p>
<p>what are you gonna loot?</p>
<p>You know, you&rsquo;ll have AOC say, oh, people needing bread.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t see a single loaf of bread.</p>
<p>You know, I saw televisions and shoes and you know,</p>
<p>but to me, it is poetry in a sense,</p>
<p>because you get to see who we,</p>
<p>how we actually are operating, you know,</p>
<p>what is becoming first principles to most people.</p>
<p>But wait, wait, but you could also argue though,</p>
<p>those riots were more like the madness of crowds,</p>
<p>which is definitely a lot more than just that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just saying that given a chance, it&rsquo;s like, okay, boom,</p>
<p>the lights are off, the grid is down.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve hacked into the whole system,</p>
<p>turned into an 80s movie.</p>
<p>And you have the ability to go get ahold of whatever it is</p>
<p>that you think is most important.</p>
<p>And what do we do?</p>
<p>And I say, we, as in, you know, including all of us,</p>
<p>we grab a TV, we attack it.</p>
<p>We break into a sneaker store in Melrose.</p>
<p>We do, it&rsquo;s just like, ah, we still giant cause statues</p>
<p>where the value of that is completely market driven.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s just a piece of polypropylene or whatever,</p>
<p>butyl and you know, it&rsquo;s cool.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a big fan of art, but it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>you know, I can&rsquo;t eat that.</p>
<p>And at the end of the day, man,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re sitting there with your, like,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;d you do today, honey?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;d you get?</p>
<p>You know, man, we were able to, you know,</p>
<p>oh, I got this, I got this designer art statue.</p>
<p>Are you going to go, well, you can&rsquo;t really sell it</p>
<p>on the, on like the art markets</p>
<p>where people were really going to pay for it.</p>
<p>So are you going to become an underground art dealer</p>
<p>with your one piece of cause art?</p>
<p>One interesting thing you just said before I forget it,</p>
<p>you mentioned the library of Alexandria and your.</p>
<p>Phone.</p>
<p>Well, your phone, but also just thinking</p>
<p>of your little world that you&rsquo;re creating</p>
<p>for yourself on the internet.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a really powerful way to actually phrase it.</p>
<p>One of the things that you&rsquo;ve been on Joe Rogan</p>
<p>several times.</p>
<p>Although everybody always comes to me and go,</p>
<p>oh, that was so great.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know you, you&rsquo;re on, you&rsquo;ve on Joe Rogan.</p>
<p>I go, this is like my fifth time, dude.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been a fan of yours for a long time</p>
<p>from other avenues.</p>
<p>This is a long time coming actually.</p>
<p>Everybody, you have no idea.</p>
<p>Like how many times through messaging</p>
<p>and missing each other over the years.</p>
<p>This is ridiculous.</p>
<p>This is a long time coming.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t realize how special this is for us.</p>
<p>This is, well, I&rsquo;m also starstruck.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll talk about this,</p>
<p>but you symbolize something very important to me</p>
<p>through my journey, through wrestling,</p>
<p>through Jiu Jitsu, through Judo,</p>
<p>through just street fighting, through just combat.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a, you&rsquo;re the, in some sense,</p>
<p>the devil on my shoulder of like, of violence.</p>
<p>In a good, in a, devil gets a bad rap.</p>
<p>He does get a bad rap.</p>
<p>I realize, you know, sitting encased in ice</p>
<p>down at that low ass level, you know.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But, you know, the angel side is more like the athletic,</p>
<p>the sport, the science, the technical,</p>
<p>the chess side of things.</p>
<p>So, but on the library, Alexander, let me ask,</p>
<p>because you were on Joe Rogan,</p>
<p>it does make me really sad.</p>
<p>And I realize that I&rsquo;m just probably being romantic</p>
<p>that his, most of his library of interviews</p>
<p>that were on YouTube have now been taken down</p>
<p>because he went to Spotify.</p>
<p>And that was the first, I&rsquo;m probably an idiot,</p>
<p>but it was the first time I realized</p>
<p>that this knowledge that we&rsquo;ve been building up</p>
<p>on the internet doesn&rsquo;t necessarily last forever.</p>
<p>No, it doesn&rsquo;t, unless you preserve it.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s like all things.</p>
<p>If you do not preserve them, if you do not make efforts,</p>
<p>you know, so many of my, it just really brings</p>
<p>the minor off the top of my head.</p>
<p>All my, so many friends of mine that are Jewish,</p>
<p>you know, they&rsquo;re basically secular.</p>
<p>But yet through even the secular aspect</p>
<p>of just keeping the traditions alive, it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>well, you could always pick a book and read about it.</p>
<p>Clearly, it&rsquo;s called the Torah.</p>
<p>But if you don&rsquo;t put these things into action,</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t make them a part of your consciousness,</p>
<p>maybe even on the subconsciousness,</p>
<p>just through repetition, they will die.</p>
<p>They will become simply something that exists somewhere</p>
<p>until you find it again.</p>
<p>And Carl Gotch used to say something,</p>
<p>he would say that I don&rsquo;t invent moves,</p>
<p>I just rediscover them.</p>
<p>But yet Gotch and Billy Robinson also would understand</p>
<p>that you, if someone&rsquo;s not carrying the torch,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll go out.</p>
<p>Now that doesn&rsquo;t mean fire can&rsquo;t be rekindled.</p>
<p>It just means that it, that torch no longer</p>
<p>is lighting the way on this knowledge.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s important to be an individual,</p>
<p>even on an individual level,</p>
<p>to be a repository for aspects of knowledge.</p>
<p>You mentioned Gotch.</p>
<p>You consider yourself a catch wrestler.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve mentioned to you offline that I competed</p>
<p>in a couple of catch wrestling tournaments.</p>
<p>Can we go Wikipedia level at the very basic,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re the exactly right person to ask,</p>
<p>what is catch wrestling?</p>
<p>And what are its defining principles?</p>
<p>I would say the easiest way for us to talk about</p>
<p>and give an overview of what catch is</p>
<p>in the simplest terms is think of collegiate wrestling</p>
<p>with submissions.</p>
<p>That is essentially what catch is.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not surprising because collegiate wrestling</p>
<p>is actually derived from catch as catch can.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that over time certain aspects</p>
<p>were removed from the competition structure</p>
<p>so that they became null elements,</p>
<p>things that were discarded.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s funny that you can take a high level</p>
<p>amateur collegiate types and you can show them a move</p>
<p>and then add a little bit to it and go,</p>
<p>oh, well, hey, that was just like what we already do here,</p>
<p>but except, oh, I didn&rsquo;t know you could take it</p>
<p>all the way to this point.</p>
<p>Or things of that nature,</p>
<p>especially when it comes to professional wrestling,</p>
<p>teaching people like, no, I know you&rsquo;re just using this</p>
<p>in a show, but this is actually a real move</p>
<p>and here&rsquo;s how it really feels.</p>
<p>And so collegiate wrestling and wrestling in general</p>
<p>for people who are not aware is basically</p>
<p>two people start on their feet and they have to score,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re trying to take each other down</p>
<p>and they score points along the way.</p>
<p>You can end matches by pinning them,</p>
<p>for example, on their back.</p>
<p>I think one way to describe wrestling</p>
<p>is it&rsquo;s very much about figuring out ways</p>
<p>to establish control and leverage</p>
<p>in these kind of tie ups,</p>
<p>or there&rsquo;s different styles where you can do more</p>
<p>from a distance to where it&rsquo;s more about the timing</p>
<p>and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Ultimately, it&rsquo;s an art of like both upper body</p>
<p>and lower body and you could choose the different puzzles</p>
<p>that you solve there.</p>
<p>You could be attacking the head, the arms,</p>
<p>you could be attacking the legs.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also part of collegiate wrestling</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s on the ground that has more,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s called like a referee&rsquo;s position or whatever.</p>
<p>The referee&rsquo;s position where you&rsquo;re on your hands</p>
<p>and knees basically.</p>
<p>And so.</p>
<p>Do you understand what that&rsquo;s supposed to simulate?</p>
<p>Why is that one of the standard positions?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of the standard positions because one,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s one of the easiest ways to actually get up,</p>
<p>but two, it&rsquo;s because you cannot be on your back.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re on your back, you&rsquo;re getting pinned.</p>
<p>And back exposure or being pinned</p>
<p>is pretty much the universal wrestling thing.</p>
<p>One, taking the guy from their feet to the floor</p>
<p>and two, pinning them.</p>
<p>As you go from like, what is it?</p>
<p>Cornish wrestling, Turkish oil wrestling, Mongolian, Sumo,</p>
<p>Indian, well, they&rsquo;ll call it Palwani.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also called Kushti, Jiu Jitsu, Judo.</p>
<p>So many of them is like, there&rsquo;s a,</p>
<p>you sombo, even if it doesn&rsquo;t end the match,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s still like one of the most important aspects</p>
<p>of the competition itself, across almost every style.</p>
<p>And this is where submission, like catch wrestling</p>
<p>or submission wrestling or Jiu Jitsu feels different,</p>
<p>which it seems like for most wrestling,</p>
<p>for a lot of wrestling, the dominance is the goal,</p>
<p>as opposed to submission,</p>
<p>which I guess those are two are related,</p>
<p>but dominating the position.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what pinning is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like breaking your opponent,</p>
<p>like breaking through all of their defenses</p>
<p>to where they&rsquo;re completely defenses</p>
<p>and you could do anything with them that you want.</p>
<p>Maybe that&rsquo;s what could be a definition of dominance.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I mean, it sounds very much like a chain to a radiator.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s a threat that connects all runners,</p>
<p>but submission feels different.</p>
<p>It is actually different when you think about it</p>
<p>across the landscape.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think radically different,</p>
<p>but just still slightly different.</p>
<p>And that if you think of wrestling</p>
<p>as being derived from combat, right?</p>
<p>So, well, it is combat sports, but more lethal combat.</p>
<p>Getting somebody off their feet and onto their back</p>
<p>is about as lethal a place</p>
<p>for the person on bottom to be in general.</p>
<p>I mean, don&rsquo;t come at me with your talks</p>
<p>about your fucking worm guards and blah, blah, blah,</p>
<p>and whatever spider, bear, okay, get out of here with that.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not talking about you</p>
<p>in this highly regimented sporting environment.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking about general, all the body hair,</p>
<p>none of the waxing human beings.</p>
<p>So getting someone on their back,</p>
<p>okay, as you&rsquo;re trying to get up,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re getting hit with a rock or stabbed</p>
<p>or what have you set on fire, who knows?</p>
<p>Generally, these conflicts are not just isolated</p>
<p>to one on one.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s four on two,</p>
<p>your buddy that was with you back to back,</p>
<p>now he&rsquo;s on his back.</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>
<p>And now it&rsquo;s gonna be one on one while three go on one.</p>
<p>So, and then you elevate this to armored combat, right?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s boom, put them on the ground.</p>
<p>Oh, crap, it&rsquo;s hard to get up.</p>
<p>Well, while you&rsquo;re struggling to get up, stab.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where jujitsu&rsquo;s concepts come from</p>
<p>with all their leveraging and off balancing is,</p>
<p>oh man, if I end up in this situation</p>
<p>in tight close quarters combat,</p>
<p>yes, we could fight it out with swords and knives</p>
<p>and what have you, but it&rsquo;s way easier</p>
<p>if the first thing I can do is foot sweep you on your back</p>
<p>and then pull my knife and just go stick.</p>
<p>Is there a thread that connects all of these different arts</p>
<p>from not just arts, but from the very base violence of war,</p>
<p>just like you said that there&rsquo;s no rules</p>
<p>to the very regimented IBJF.</p>
<p>I do.</p>
<p>Jiu Jitsu tournaments and just,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve kind of laid out some of it,</p>
<p>but can you go all the way to the.</p>
<p>So when you start off with absolute skills</p>
<p>in the sense of absolute offense and defense</p>
<p>in the taking or preserving of life, right?</p>
<p>Full on at its purest form of self defense</p>
<p>and self preservation, okay?</p>
<p>And then you extrapolate part of that</p>
<p>in that all animals train in violence.</p>
<p>All play usually degenerates</p>
<p>into some sort of soft violence.</p>
<p>So be it cats when they&rsquo;re kittens and puppies</p>
<p>and everything learns how to kill, how to fight.</p>
<p>Not that, you know, just that dumb alpha meme stuff</p>
<p>where the idea is that, oh, by being alpha,</p>
<p>that means you run around like basically just being a bully</p>
<p>and a shithead.</p>
<p>No, actually alpha wolves spend very little time fighting</p>
<p>because if you were actually alpha,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t get into fights, there&rsquo;s no need to.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re probably getting</p>
<p>into any large amount of fights,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s probably because you&rsquo;re being shitty at being an alpha</p>
<p>and now people are tired of you being in charge.</p>
<p>And yet in the animal world,</p>
<p>and it would be the same for human beings</p>
<p>at that base beginning level of violence,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a big risk.</p>
<p>So I know that we live in this place with healthcare</p>
<p>or you might be in a place with nationalized health,</p>
<p>whatever, right?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s band aids, there&rsquo;s penicillin,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not the normal way of things, you know?</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s a channel that just hurts me every time.</p>
<p>I used to follow it and I had to unfollow it</p>
<p>because it was too painful for me as a human being</p>
<p>called Nature is Metal on Instagram.</p>
<p>It was sobering and then it was like, this is too sobering.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very sobering.</p>
<p>So in there, the risk is at its highest level.</p>
<p>The damage you take, the winner walks away hurt.</p>
<p>Getting lamed when you need every aspect</p>
<p>of your physical and athletic faculties to survive</p>
<p>because this isn&rsquo;t the first</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s definitely not gonna be the last,</p>
<p>especially if you&rsquo;re the slowest one.</p>
<p>What is it, there&rsquo;s a lyric from a clutch song.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t go for the fat ones, just go for the slow ones.</p>
<p>Oh man, but that&rsquo;s the universal truth</p>
<p>of the way nature works.</p>
<p>You said it&rsquo;s not cruel, it&rsquo;s not cruel,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just the way it is.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, watch animals getting into fights</p>
<p>on any of these sort of documentary stuff.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll see an intense short and then dispersal.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll see as soon as one feels like things have switched</p>
<p>just enough to boom, the bear or whatever it is takes off.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, I&rsquo;m done with this.</p>
<p>Because if you can get out of there with just some scars</p>
<p>and what have you, okay.</p>
<p>You lose an eye, nah, it&rsquo;s not as good.</p>
<p>You really get hurt bad and get infected, you&rsquo;re done.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a serious risk to be</p>
<p>that can come with these sort of things.</p>
<p>Yet, I believe that we are inherently born</p>
<p>for at least aspects of and use of violence.</p>
<p>And so at the end of the day, we need these things</p>
<p>not just to, not just survive each other,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re a part of being able to hunt and other things.</p>
<p>So violence is a part of human nature.</p>
<p>Violence is, it&rsquo;s an absolute.</p>
<p>It is in every person, it is a part of every interaction,</p>
<p>it is a part of every law, everything.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not, by the way, I&rsquo;m not an ANCAP.</p>
<p>So don&rsquo;t even, don&rsquo;t hit your wagon to me on that one.</p>
<p>ANCAP is anarchic capitalist. Anarchic capitalist, yes.</p>
<p>Not an ANCAP.</p>
<p>They have nice book shops.</p>
<p>Yeah, they do.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m not gonna sit here and shit talk ANCAPs.</p>
<p>Although I also used to get into the conversations</p>
<p>with an ANCOM, anarcho communist, a good friend of mine.</p>
<p>And he would bring up this stuff and I&rsquo;m like,</p>
<p>yeah, cool, man, I&rsquo;m down with anarchy.</p>
<p>You ain&rsquo;t gonna like it.</p>
<p>What do you mean?</p>
<p>I go, cause I&rsquo;m gonna take all,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna gather all kinds of people together.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna make this, I&rsquo;m gonna get the strongest together</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m going to take your shit.</p>
<p>Okay, can I ask you on that topic,</p>
<p>I have a friend of mine now,</p>
<p>a fellow Russian, Ukrainian, Michael Malice.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, I&rsquo;m familiar with Michael Malice.</p>
<p>I watched a little bit of your guy&rsquo;s show.</p>
<p>I watched a little bit of your guy&rsquo;s conversation.</p>
<p>So this is really good to ask you because&hellip;</p>
<p>I like how he&rsquo;s in the white suit</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re in the white and black.</p>
<p>But he lives in New York City.</p>
<p>He espouses ideas of anarchism and his idea,</p>
<p>and this is different than sort of the Ayn Rand set of ideas</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a line between sort of capitalism</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s backed by the state and just pure anarchism.</p>
<p>And his idea that violence won&rsquo;t take over in an anarchism</p>
<p>is one that feels to me not grounded in reality.</p>
<p>I may be wrong.</p>
<p>So is there some, so the idea with pure capitalism is that&hellip;</p>
<p>You mean laissez faire, completely deregulated?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, what it will agree, it&rsquo;ll end up in one,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll end up in, if you&rsquo;re anti globalist,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna be that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna be globalist 100% because it has no&hellip;</p>
<p>Pure capitalism has no consideration for your native users</p>
<p>or of any sort, like it doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>But the idea of governments is that the land,</p>
<p>the little piece of land geographically you&rsquo;re born on</p>
<p>means you&rsquo;re going to stick</p>
<p>to whatever founding documents created that little land.</p>
<p>So anarchism is against that.</p>
<p>And the argument is you should be able to choose</p>
<p>which ideas you live with.</p>
<p>And the concern there is nobody,</p>
<p>this geographical land, the governments</p>
<p>that organize on that land</p>
<p>do not need to protect you from the violence.</p>
<p>And my sense is there does need to be an army,</p>
<p>there does need to be police that help,</p>
<p>however the form that police takes.</p>
<p>But there needs to be a more centralized,</p>
<p>not completely centralized,</p>
<p>but more centralized safety net</p>
<p>to protect you from the violence.</p>
<p>Scale again, right?</p>
<p>So if you want to have your anarchist utopia,</p>
<p>well, we won&rsquo;t call it utopia,</p>
<p>your anarchist creation here.</p>
<p>At certain scale, I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s doable.</p>
<p>But as it scales, as the scale increases,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s completely untenable.</p>
<p>And a state will emerge.</p>
<p>A state will always emerge.</p>
<p>Because even people always think of states</p>
<p>as like people rubbing their hands</p>
<p>and smoking cigars in back rooms</p>
<p>and just out of nowhere coming around</p>
<p>and just like, oh, we&rsquo;re going to create</p>
<p>this big centralized thing</p>
<p>and just so that we can tell everybody what to do</p>
<p>and we can be in charge.</p>
<p>I mean, I know that there are people like that that exist,</p>
<p>that they would like to do things of that nature</p>
<p>and that they see the use of power</p>
<p>as something to be used more for their personal gains</p>
<p>over first, which again, self interest in human beings.</p>
<p>But eventually a state, people want,</p>
<p>they want something to go like, okay,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s taking care of this?</p>
<p>And who&rsquo;s taking care of that?</p>
<p>And how do we create some sort of protocol for this?</p>
<p>Like, okay, well, when it&rsquo;s not Bob,</p>
<p>when is it Susie, when is it whatever?</p>
<p>I mean, like, how do we, it&rsquo;s gotta get done</p>
<p>if we want this thing to become bigger,</p>
<p>if we want all of our plumbing to work right,</p>
<p>if we want, it&rsquo;s just, I&rsquo;m sorry, a state&rsquo;s gonna happen.</p>
<p>A state is also, when you think about it,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s supposed to have consideration to tribe, right?</p>
<p>So if people think that we&rsquo;re not tribes,</p>
<p>well, you&rsquo;re not really thinking very deeply.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re all tribes of a sort.</p>
<p>And everybody likes to use the word tribalism</p>
<p>in this idea of this antagonistic concept.</p>
<p>And while sure, tribalism can be antagonistic,</p>
<p>tribalism can also be a positive thing,</p>
<p>or I could just say, it just seems to be a natural thing.</p>
<p>People, they create their groups of one sort or another.</p>
<p>And so when you have, well, when you think about</p>
<p>when nation states really started to become a thing,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t mean even the more modern looking variants</p>
<p>that we could think back up and say the 19th century</p>
<p>or something like that, even older than that.</p>
<p>I mean, you think the Assyrians</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t have a state of some sort?</p>
<p>Of course they did.</p>
<p>How do you increase your empire</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t actually have a place to start from?</p>
<p>Just to be a ruler.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re saying like naturally,</p>
<p>when you start talking and thinking about scale of humans,</p>
<p>naturally states emerge.</p>
<p>And so can we try to make an argument for anarchism,</p>
<p>which is, so anarchy in a sense is an opposition</p>
<p>to the unhelpful, unproductive, inefficient bureaucracies</p>
<p>that eventually the states lead to.</p>
<p>Yes, and that&rsquo;s what we can see.</p>
<p>I mean, I would say less anarchy,</p>
<p>more study James Burnham, you know,</p>
<p>or, well, anybody that wants to talk</p>
<p>about the managerial problem and the managerial.</p>
<p>I see, so you have a sense, a hope,</p>
<p>maybe let&rsquo;s think like what is the path forward</p>
<p>with the inefficient state?</p>
<p>Is it revolution or is it to work within the system</p>
<p>to constantly improve it, to manage better?</p>
<p>Man, I don&rsquo;t know that one.</p>
<p>I mean, my general sense,</p>
<p>and maybe this is the Nietzschean part of me,</p>
<p>is that, yeah, it would take maybe not even just,</p>
<p>maybe not even defining it specifically as revolution.</p>
<p>Maybe it would just take just total calamity</p>
<p>to get people to stop being shitty,</p>
<p>to not stop being a lesser version of themselves,</p>
<p>to stop thinking more about things</p>
<p>from the paradigm that we exist in now,</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;re giving so much value to stuff</p>
<p>that isn&rsquo;t really all that valuable.</p>
<p>Where we&rsquo;re so concerned about likes,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t just mean like whether we get them or not,</p>
<p>but that, oh man, maybe we should take this off</p>
<p>of our platform,</p>
<p>because this is too destabilizing to people.</p>
<p>Because once you exceed Dunbar&rsquo;s number,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s actually,</p>
<p>without having the right faculties,</p>
<p>which would need to be developed,</p>
<p>because this is dealing with tech that brings things,</p>
<p>ways of approaching being that we are not</p>
<p>naturally programmed to be able to handle appropriately.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s even more detrimental to women than men,</p>
<p>because I think women have a more natural proclivity</p>
<p>towards group association</p>
<p>and more group oriented thinking and patterning.</p>
<p>And now, and with also coupled with</p>
<p>seemingly more sensitivity towards human states.</p>
<p>So I feel like women, like the classic idea is like,</p>
<p>oh, you know, women are psychic,</p>
<p>you know, they have a sixth sense and what have you.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s just a way of simplifying,</p>
<p>what I think is that women may be more in tune</p>
<p>with picking up on the unsaid.</p>
<p>Like they might be better at seeing physical cues,</p>
<p>inflection and tone, like different,</p>
<p>like they may be far more sensitive to these things,</p>
<p>which to me would make sense,</p>
<p>because dealing with children that can&rsquo;t communicate.</p>
<p>So distinctively, right now, okay.</p>
<p>Now, whether it be a woman or a man,</p>
<p>but especially with even the social push</p>
<p>on this concept of empathy,</p>
<p>which of course it gets to the point</p>
<p>where it loses any meaning anymore.</p>
<p>Like people use the word empathy</p>
<p>absolutely incorrectly all the time.</p>
<p>And they don&rsquo;t even understand</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re really asking of people.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s just take it as we&rsquo;re using empathy</p>
<p>in the correct sense.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re taking on the emotional content</p>
<p>of the thing itself.</p>
<p>Now you open that up to thousands of people,</p>
<p>maybe hundreds of thousands of people all across the world</p>
<p>that you will never meet, that you will never know,</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re not even getting an actual true representation</p>
<p>most of the time of who these people are.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re meeting persona.</p>
<p>And some of these personas are even deliberately created</p>
<p>to elicit a response inauthentically.</p>
<p>Are you referring to bots or?</p>
<p>Could be bots or actual people.</p>
<p>Bots are one thing, but I mean,</p>
<p>there are literal people out there</p>
<p>that will create something, create GoFundMes</p>
<p>for tragedies that never didn&rsquo;t really,</p>
<p>or events that didn&rsquo;t happen or any number of things.</p>
<p>Okay, I mean, burn their own house down</p>
<p>and then say, you know, we were attacked.</p>
<p>And then it comes down, oh, you did it to yourself</p>
<p>because you wanted money and empathy and this, that.</p>
<p>And you wanted all this emotional wealth,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say this emotional coin,</p>
<p>as well as actual if possible.</p>
<p>You wanted to leverage it in some way.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not the majority of people,</p>
<p>but I would say a good amount of folks are thinking,</p>
<p>well, if I post this photo</p>
<p>and I put this little blurb in there,</p>
<p>I bet I can get this much cache out of it in this sense.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not even, and this isn&rsquo;t just a reference</p>
<p>to like butt pics and stuff like that.</p>
<p>Because clearly, obviously people understand</p>
<p>that our inborn sexual nature is easy to manipulate.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s pretty obvious.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re saying this kind of new medium</p>
<p>of communication on social media is unnatural.</p>
<p>And it preys on us.</p>
<p>And so as you want this, you know,</p>
<p>you look at an anarchist kind of mindset, right?</p>
<p>And so you&rsquo;re just like, there&rsquo;s no,</p>
<p>there is no overarching state to create</p>
<p>any kind of a structure, right?</p>
<p>And so if you have that unfettered capitalism aspect</p>
<p>with it, and before I say anything particularly damning</p>
<p>about unfettered capitalism, I&rsquo;m a massive capitalist</p>
<p>because I view capitalism essentially as,</p>
<p>what it boils down to is I get these arguments to people too.</p>
<p>They start giving me all these extra definitions</p>
<p>about capitalism like, no, no,</p>
<p>this is obviously some sort of theory</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re taking from other shit.</p>
<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t describe capitalism.</p>
<p>Capitalism is the ability for us to create whatever we want</p>
<p>or, you know, create our thoughts, ideas, physical things</p>
<p>and trade them freely amongst each other</p>
<p>in ways that we find acceptable, right?</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;m not even using the word fair</p>
<p>because I might think it&rsquo;s fair to me.</p>
<p>You might think, huh, well, I mean, that was actually,</p>
<p>I think what he thought was unfair to him</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s more fair to me.</p>
<p>And then someone, a third observer goes,</p>
<p>oh man, you should not have paid that for that.</p>
<p>You should have paid this.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, well, you know what?</p>
<p>It works for me without&hellip;</p>
<p>Sufficiently acceptable that you both agree</p>
<p>to the transaction.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>But also at the root of that is freedom, right?</p>
<p>And as far as I can tell,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been banging this around in my head,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like for every one unit of freedom,</p>
<p>you need two units of accountability.</p>
<p>And if you don&rsquo;t have that,</p>
<p>what you end up with is human self interest.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not even gonna get into evil.</p>
<p>Human self interest, sabotaging other things,</p>
<p>even not in a sense to be malicious.</p>
<p>Okay, so in terms of,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s put this as mathematically speaking,</p>
<p>I love this.</p>
<p>So anarchism is more like two units of freedom</p>
<p>and one unit of accountability</p>
<p>or maybe zero units of accountability.</p>
<p>Possibly, I mean, the anarchists tend to think like,</p>
<p>no, everyone will be accountable.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, fuck they will.</p>
<p>When have you seen this happen in real life?</p>
<p>People aren&rsquo;t even accountable</p>
<p>in their revolutions at the time.</p>
<p>So you aren&rsquo;t looking at the way people really are.</p>
<p>Marx is like, yeah, the people are like this,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re like that.</p>
<p>Look at how capitalism does it.</p>
<p>I mean, he of course assigns a lot of really</p>
<p>ridiculous economic principles and practice,</p>
<p>but and also assumes that everybody</p>
<p>who makes any profit from anything is somehow stealing it</p>
<p>and really assigns a negative moral aspect to them.</p>
<p>And then it&rsquo;s like, oh yeah,</p>
<p>but then eventually communism will happen.</p>
<p>No one will act that way anymore.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re like, whoa, hold on.</p>
<p>You just said that people are all,</p>
<p>are you saying it&rsquo;s all due to capitalism</p>
<p>or is it innate?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s a fundamental misunderstanding of,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like, hey, look at you.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like a notorious, like antisemitic, angry,</p>
<p>like just absolute curmudgeon of a human being</p>
<p>who seems to be really not all that fun to be around.</p>
<p>Marx?</p>
<p>Yeah, and then it&rsquo;s just like.</p>
<p>So you have to think like,</p>
<p>if there was 1 billion Marx&rsquo;s in the world,</p>
<p>how would they behave?</p>
<p>It would be absolute.</p>
<p>They would hate each other so bad.</p>
<p>And this isn&rsquo;t, for me to even poison them well on Marx</p>
<p>is like, oh, his personality sucks.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s lots of people whose personality sucks.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t mean they can&rsquo;t make,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know that it&rsquo;s never, what?</p>
<p>You know what, somebody argues.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s just a loner.</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t know that his personality sucked at all.</p>
<p>Let me walk that back and that he was human.</p>
<p>Say his personality sucked.</p>
<p>He was sometimes contradictory, irrational.</p>
<p>Sometimes he was quite sexist</p>
<p>despite the emails I&rsquo;ve gotten.</p>
<p>That told me that there&rsquo;s people who has written to me</p>
<p>that Nietzsche has been unfairly labeled as sexist</p>
<p>in his discussion about women.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pretty sure there&rsquo;s a bunch of documents</p>
<p>where he&rsquo;s just like, he&rsquo;s just a bitter guy.</p>
<p>I will agree with you.</p>
<p>And Marx is as bitter as they come to,</p>
<p>but bitterness in and of itself</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t make, like why I hate Marxism</p>
<p>comes from the entirety of the thing.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m not going to say that Marxism or practic&hellip;</p>
<p>Man, you can find any forbidden book</p>
<p>and it could have something good in it.</p>
<p>As colonel is a good idea.</p>
<p>Yeah, and like at the end of the day,</p>
<p>Marx is a human being.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s got a nice beard.</p>
<p>He does, he had a hell of a beard.</p>
<p>Yeah, a decent portrait.</p>
<p>I mean, he looks like the kind of guy like,</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t want to meet him in a dark alley,</p>
<p>but thankfully I don&rsquo;t think he was much of a fighter.</p>
<p>But in any case, I mean, not the anarchists</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;re more hot for like Max Stirner.</p>
<p>People like to think that Nietzsche borrowed a lot</p>
<p>from Stirner and my argument is one,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have any real evidence for that</p>
<p>and two, bullshit, you know?</p>
<p>I mean, anybody could, the fact that they have</p>
<p>some overlapping thoughts doesn&rsquo;t make it lifted.</p>
<p>Not to mention, go read a lot more philosophy</p>
<p>and see how there&rsquo;s so many different things.</p>
<p>Oh, this guy said it in 1722.</p>
<p>Well, and then this guy says it again in 1922.</p>
<p>Does that mean he read the other guy&rsquo;s stuff?</p>
<p>Not necessarily.</p>
<p>I mean, he&rsquo;s working from the same type</p>
<p>of human physiological construct as anybody else.</p>
<p>Like, of course it&rsquo;s possible</p>
<p>that this guy could think the same thing.</p>
<p>We think a lot of the same things, to be perfectly honest.</p>
<p>I mean, reading the Hagakure,</p>
<p>going back to philosophy books,</p>
<p>this was really impactful on me as a younger adult</p>
<p>because here&rsquo;s a book written in the 19th century</p>
<p>about someone who lived through the 19th</p>
<p>and 18th century at times as a samurai, now a monk,</p>
<p>and his objections to society at the time,</p>
<p>the same objections one was having to society</p>
<p>as I was reading it.</p>
<p>Like, the same human behaviors,</p>
<p>the same impetus for action that he found a problem,</p>
<p>like, well, that&rsquo;s the same shit now.</p>
<p>Like, we&rsquo;re not, and this was the thing,</p>
<p>and then I&rsquo;m reading more religion,</p>
<p>and I go, oh, we&rsquo;re no different</p>
<p>than anyone who wrote the Torah or older.</p>
<p>We are the same thing with the same problems,</p>
<p>with the same psychological issues,</p>
<p>the same human behaviors.</p>
<p>Like, these things are not different,</p>
<p>and we haven&rsquo;t changed.</p>
<p>Growing set of tools, though, to kill each other with</p>
<p>or to communicate together and all that kind of stuff,</p>
<p>but underlying it, there&rsquo;s a human nature.</p>
<p>Well, we&rsquo;re also trying to understand that human nature.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;ve, just like you said,</p>
<p>learning how to fish,</p>
<p>acquired more and more knowledge about that human nature,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s been a very slow journey,</p>
<p>slower than people realize</p>
<p>in terms of understanding human nature.</p>
<p>Let me ask, in terms of egoism,</p>
<p>to be curious, to get your sense about Ayn Rand</p>
<p>and her whole idea of virtue of selfishness and her,</p>
<p>because you mentioned that everybody has a kernel of truth.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s potential for a kernel of truth</p>
<p>to be discovered in anything.</p>
<p>For example, I&rsquo;ve been recently reading Mein Kampf.</p>
<p>You know what, that&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>Even, there&rsquo;s something in, there&rsquo;s probably things</p>
<p>in Mein Kampf that are not the surface level read.</p>
<p>If you get all hung up on all,</p>
<p>probably all his crap about his anger at Jews</p>
<p>and this and that, all this crap,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, okay, yeah, that&rsquo;s right on the surface.</p>
<p>Try to get below that.</p>
<p>Try to see, how is he creating the Jews as a cope somehow?</p>
<p>Like, how is he using, why are they his scapegoat,</p>
<p>and I mean scapegoat in the,</p>
<p>so Ren√© Girard&rsquo;s concept of the scapegoat,</p>
<p>I mean it in that sense, whereas Hitler uses,</p>
<p>he wants to make the Jews the scapegoat for World War I.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>For me, the starting point, similar with Ayn Rand,</p>
<p>is that Mein Kampf is not a good place to search,</p>
<p>not just because Hitler is evil,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s just not full of ideas.</p>
<p>No, it is not.</p>
<p>It has its significance due to a lot of things.</p>
<p>Historically speaking.</p>
<p>The starting point for me with Hitler</p>
<p>is to acknowledge that he is human</p>
<p>and to at least consider the possibility</p>
<p>that any one of us could have been Hitler.</p>
<p>So like, not to make it.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s a Peterson kind of concept.</p>
<p>Also, Jonathan Haidt has a thing</p>
<p>about the difference between hate and disgust mechanisms</p>
<p>and things like that, and so he goes into the,</p>
<p>looking at Hitler through his diary entries</p>
<p>and journals and stuff like that</p>
<p>to look and see it more as the disgust mechanism</p>
<p>than also trying to see if there&rsquo;s any</p>
<p>evolutionary biological attachment to this, whatever.</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;re right, he is a human being.</p>
<p>Any of us, we&rsquo;re all human beings.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that, it&rsquo;s probably jarring for people to think,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re all, I guess, supposedly potentially capable</p>
<p>of just being in, and all these evil people in the world</p>
<p>think they&rsquo;re doing it for the sake of good,</p>
<p>which makes them the most dangerous.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s some, there&rsquo;s differences in levels of insane.</p>
<p>I think Hitler was way more insane than Stalin.</p>
<p>I think Stalin legitimately thought he was doing good.</p>
<p>I would say that&rsquo;s probably true.</p>
<p>Stalin was just outright brutal.</p>
<p>Like he had his five year plan, he had all those other things.</p>
<p>He just had a much lower value for human life,</p>
<p>and so he was willing to take, make decisions</p>
<p>about what he actually, as a good executive,</p>
<p>which he was, of managing different bureaucracies and so on,</p>
<p>he was willing to make decisions</p>
<p>that resulted in mass human suffering,</p>
<p>where Hitler was, it seems like to me, much moodier.</p>
<p>So allowed emotions and moods to make decisions.</p>
<p>I think we also have to consider the different trajectories</p>
<p>and how, where, and when they were making their decisions.</p>
<p>And I mean, not by time specifically,</p>
<p>but Hitler engaged into this conflict</p>
<p>across multiple continents.</p>
<p>And then that, everything that comes</p>
<p>with basically fighting the whole world,</p>
<p>Stalin had his conflict,</p>
<p>and then he really mostly compartmentalized the rest of it.</p>
<p>So he was dealing with his own internal</p>
<p>instead of dealing with the internal and the external.</p>
<p>So if Stalin was put under a World War scenario,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, maybe he would have</p>
<p>eventually lost his marbles too.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m not sure that that&rsquo;s, you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>The hunger for power was more internalized for Stalin.</p>
<p>He wanted to control the land that already existed</p>
<p>as opposed to wanting to colonize other land.</p>
<p>He was as nationalistic as Hitler,</p>
<p>but, and was as capable and willing</p>
<p>for violent conflict as Hitler,</p>
<p>for the aims of the state.</p>
<p>But he centered and internalized</p>
<p>prior to then externalizing and moving outwards.</p>
<p>Whereas even maybe prior to him,</p>
<p>there was an interest to continually push communism</p>
<p>in an aggressive sense following on the momentum</p>
<p>from the 1918 revolution.</p>
<p>And that, the halting of that through various aspects,</p>
<p>I guess in Germany, part of that was the National Socialists.</p>
<p>Like they came up and then they were the other ones</p>
<p>to fight the communists,</p>
<p>and so you had the two totalitarians going after it.</p>
<p>But then in the rest of the world</p>
<p>that was not dealing with totalitarian aspects,</p>
<p>it was just, it wasn&rsquo;t gonna stick,</p>
<p>especially in the West and other places.</p>
<p>But Stalin, just casually thinking,</p>
<p>it seemed like Stalin decided to go,</p>
<p>all right, well, we&rsquo;re not gonna go</p>
<p>just start launching right into more conflicts here.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna, these dudes are going down,</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s cool for us,</p>
<p>because they hate us and we hate them.</p>
<p>But now we&rsquo;re gonna focus internally,</p>
<p>and then we&rsquo;re gonna work on growing at a slower rate</p>
<p>and picking our battles a bit more specifically.</p>
<p>And of course there&rsquo;s, you can get to the,</p>
<p>even this is after Stalin,</p>
<p>but you got the Bezmenov type stuff</p>
<p>talking about subversion in cultural aspects.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, there&rsquo;s this fascinating dynamics</p>
<p>to propaganda throughout the whole period that&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s a whole nother kernel, yeah.</p>
<p>Do you think Hitler could have been stopped?</p>
<p>One of the things that&rsquo;s kind of fascinating to look at</p>
<p>is how many nations, both journalists and nations,</p>
<p>wanted, almost craved to take Hitler at his word</p>
<p>that he wanted peace until it was too late.</p>
<p>They almost wanted to delude themselves.</p>
<p>I mean, the same is true with the Stalin,</p>
<p>people wanted to take Stalin at his word for.</p>
<p>Oh, they still delude themselves.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>We will delude ourselves over any number of things</p>
<p>until even after the fact where the history just says,</p>
<p>hey, fuck face, you know?</p>
<p>You cannot supplement your pseudo reality</p>
<p>onto actual reality here.</p>
<p>But yet, we deal with people in pseudo realities constantly.</p>
<p>I mean, we will always find a way</p>
<p>to change reality to suit our needs.</p>
<p>Well, the nature of truth now,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s now multiple actual truths.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of fascinating.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s multiple versions of history</p>
<p>that people are telling.</p>
<p>You know, the version of the Great Patriotic War in Russia,</p>
<p>the World War II in Russia is very different today</p>
<p>under Putin than the version</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re learning in the United States</p>
<p>and then different than the version in Europe.</p>
<p>In the United States, the hero of the war</p>
<p>is the United States.</p>
<p>In Europe, there&rsquo;s a much more sad and solemn story</p>
<p>of suffering and so on.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>In Russia, it&rsquo;s the Great.</p>
<p>Patriotic War.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>It was a unifier of a sense.</p>
<p>And it, I mean, yeah, I mean,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t argue that war and conflict that,</p>
<p>and or just even reducing that to stressors,</p>
<p>agitation, suffering doesn&rsquo;t create human motivation.</p>
<p>You know, we started this off.</p>
<p>You brought up a Frankel.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, yeah, Frankel&rsquo;s dope.</p>
<p>Man, it serves for meaning.</p>
<p>Maslow&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>And I talked to you about how I started to think like,</p>
<p>man, do the ability for human beings to live</p>
<p>and or potentially flourish</p>
<p>in the worst environments you can think of</p>
<p>is pretty incredible in and of itself.</p>
<p>And that it&rsquo;s a crazy thought to think that</p>
<p>without Frankel and Maslow ending up in concentration camps,</p>
<p>do they write some of the most important books</p>
<p>on philosophy in the 20th century?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s insane on a lot of different levels.</p>
<p>But, yeah, suffering is a creative force.</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t, do you think we&rsquo;ll always have war?</p>
<p>Yes, we will always have war in some form or another.</p>
<p>We need, quote unquote, air quotes,</p>
<p>for those just listening, war to survive.</p>
<p>We need war to flourish.</p>
<p>We need at least.</p>
<p>Can you explain the quote, the air quotes around the war?</p>
<p>Well, because take, take, take, take the.</p>
<p>You see wars as violence?</p>
<p>No, wars are not violence.</p>
<p>So like, so when we&rsquo;re talking.</p>
<p>No, air quotes because while us getting on the mat</p>
<p>or just getting on these hardwood floors</p>
<p>and wrestling around is not literal war,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s war of a sorts.</p>
<p>It is a diluted form of war.</p>
<p>American football is a diluted form of war.</p>
<p>All this, these are diluted forms of war.</p>
<p>Tennis is a diluted form of war.</p>
<p>And I think one of the best explanations I ever got</p>
<p>from this, and another person very impactful</p>
<p>on my life and outlook and thinking about things,</p>
<p>Cormac McCarthy.</p>
<p>And so in Blood Meridian, there&rsquo;s this fantastic speech</p>
<p>about war given by the judge,</p>
<p>which there&rsquo;s a ton of fantastic speeches</p>
<p>on things given by the judge, yeah.</p>
<p>All that exists in creation without my knowledge</p>
<p>does so without my consent.</p>
<p>Okay, that&rsquo;s pretty heavy.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s hard.</p>
<p>Go ahead, can you break that up?</p>
<p>Can you say that again?</p>
<p>All things that exist in creation,</p>
<p>all things that exist without my knowledge</p>
<p>do so without my consent.</p>
<p>What does that mean?</p>
<p>Well, I think from the judge&rsquo;s perspective,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, well, I didn&rsquo;t consent to that bird</p>
<p>or that dog or this building or all this,</p>
<p>like all of this, you know, I didn&rsquo;t create it,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s done so without my consent.</p>
<p>And if it&rsquo;s up to my consent,</p>
<p>well, I&rsquo;ll design it how I want to.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s another similar look into how the judge is</p>
<p>in that book is he would study everything</p>
<p>everywhere he went.</p>
<p>And so he&rsquo;s collected this group of nary do wells</p>
<p>from all over to go on these hunts</p>
<p>against certain tribes in the Southwest</p>
<p>and getting paid by the US government,</p>
<p>the Mexican government.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s on these Indian hunts</p>
<p>and yet they&rsquo;re going to all these different places</p>
<p>and they would stay the night in a cave somewhere</p>
<p>and he would find cave paintings,</p>
<p>he would write them all down,</p>
<p>or he would find old pieces.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an example of him, the narrator,</p>
<p>explaining how watching the judge and how he drawing,</p>
<p>I mean, he&rsquo;s got this notebook just full of things,</p>
<p>drawings and writings,</p>
<p>and how he found like a piece of armor</p>
<p>from a conquistador or something way back in the day,</p>
<p>Spanish armor, and he draws it into his book</p>
<p>and then crushes it.</p>
<p>And so the reason we&rsquo;ll always have war</p>
<p>in this society is because there&rsquo;s this struggle</p>
<p>amongst people that want to be the designers.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s that, but I&rsquo;m just saying</p>
<p>that he&rsquo;s got this whole quote on war,</p>
<p>like war is play, war is a game,</p>
<p>and the difference is is that what&rsquo;s at stake.</p>
<p>So all things are a game of some sort</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re putting up for it</p>
<p>or what you&rsquo;re willing to put up for it</p>
<p>determines whether or not you&rsquo;re going to participate or not.</p>
<p>And all aspects of any game is war</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just, what is at stake?</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s your life, it&rsquo;s a different story.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s just a coin, it&rsquo;s another thing.</p>
<p>A nice way to put it is if humans play a game</p>
<p>in this kind of pursuit of creating,</p>
<p>whatever the hell the reason is</p>
<p>that we keep creating cooler and cooler things,</p>
<p>it seems to be the result of a game</p>
<p>that we naturally play, we naturally crave.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, I mean, that&rsquo;s been the struggle of philosophy</p>
<p>is to understand what is the underlying force of all that.</p>
<p>Is it the will to power?</p>
<p>I think will to power is a really great way</p>
<p>of describing it.</p>
<p>Do you want to be the winner of the game?</p>
<p>No, not just, no, I don&rsquo;t look at will to power</p>
<p>as being the winner of the game.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, if we&rsquo;re going to get philosophical,</p>
<p>yes, you want to be the winner of the game.</p>
<p>What does winning the game define how you win?</p>
<p>Everybody&rsquo;s going to define that win differently.</p>
<p>You could define the win in the most base level</p>
<p>like, oh, I got all the things.</p>
<p>Well, if you got all those things</p>
<p>without the needing component of fulfillment,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re going to be a very unhappy person</p>
<p>with a whole lot of things.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a self referential aspect to where, to me,</p>
<p>the winner of the game is defined</p>
<p>by the people playing the game.</p>
<p>So if I&rsquo;m playing a game, I want to win in the sense</p>
<p>that most of the other people who are playing the game</p>
<p>will say, yeah, that guy won.</p>
<p>By our collective definition, if I just come up,</p>
<p>listen, I&rsquo;m sort of, if I come up with my own.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a lot of weight on the external on you.</p>
<p>Right, but that&rsquo;s how games seem to work.</p>
<p>Somewhat.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m already a winner in my life</p>
<p>by defining my own definition of success.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m basically the best person in the world at doing me.</p>
<p>At being Lex.</p>
<p>Yeah, so like, and I&rsquo;m really happy with that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a source of happiness.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, think about it.</p>
<p>Games are also iterated, right?</p>
<p>So you start off with your game</p>
<p>and then your game with your immediates</p>
<p>and then the game further than that</p>
<p>and the game further than that</p>
<p>and then the game today and the game tomorrow</p>
<p>and the game next week.</p>
<p>And so it never ends.</p>
<p>And if you try to keep thinking about it that way,</p>
<p>no wonder people go crazy.</p>
<p>But we don&rsquo;t want to think about things that way.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t want to think about being towards death.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t want to think about whether or not</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going anywhere after this</p>
<p>other than in the ground or what have you.</p>
<p>Like, you know.</p>
<p>All of these games are a sense of some distraction.</p>
<p>This is where we brought up.</p>
<p>Kind of, but I mean, it&rsquo;s violence is that</p>
<p>we need to let this out.</p>
<p>And so it is of our, kids need to wrestle and play</p>
<p>just like animals need to wrestle and play.</p>
<p>We need to have forms of competition.</p>
<p>We need to have ways to test ourselves,</p>
<p>to create when, what is it?</p>
<p>When at peace a man of war makes war with himself.</p>
<p>And so we need to be able to competently</p>
<p>go at war with ourselves and go at war with our neighbor</p>
<p>and go at war with our neighbor&rsquo;s neighbor</p>
<p>in a way that is repeatable at the very least.</p>
<p>So one way of saying that there will always be war,</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s my hopeful view</p>
<p>is that most of the war conducted in the future</p>
<p>will be, like you said,</p>
<p>the man must go to war with himself.</p>
<p>That would be great.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what to me love is,</p>
<p>is like focusing on yourself and your own improvement</p>
<p>and your own creativity and towards others feeling,</p>
<p>sort of emphasizing cooperative behavior</p>
<p>and compassion and empathy.</p>
<p>It would be great.</p>
<p>But I mean, you can have, well, I&rsquo;ll put it to you this way.</p>
<p>If you have a whole community of Randians</p>
<p>and a whole community of Ancoms,</p>
<p>and they could all like, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>toast of London on Netflix,</p>
<p>and they love Netflix and they love the internet</p>
<p>and they love picking apart Mon Comp with you.</p>
<p>They love like, they like all these things,</p>
<p>even the esoteric that they can get on with.</p>
<p>But at the fundamental root,</p>
<p>they cannot help but go to war</p>
<p>because they are literally oil and water.</p>
<p>No, but see, but they would,</p>
<p>the very labels they assign to themselves</p>
<p>would need to dissipate.</p>
<p>Well, this is true.</p>
<p>Well, then you would have to stop being</p>
<p>whatever it is that you took on</p>
<p>as your ideological or religious point, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, there&rsquo;s some days I&rsquo;m Ancom,</p>
<p>some days I&rsquo;m Ancaps and whatever the anarchic capital.</p>
<p>I mean, it depends on the hour, the minute of the day,</p>
<p>you constantly changing moods and embracing that flow,</p>
<p>the change of opinions, of ideas.</p>
<p>As there&rsquo;s some days like,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m actually cognizant of the fact</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ve been not getting my sleep.</p>
<p>And after I get some sleep,</p>
<p>I see I&rsquo;m so much more optimistic about the world.</p>
<p>The less and less sleep I get,</p>
<p>the more sad and cynical I get.</p>
<p>I can see that.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an up and down constantly.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even let my, well, okay.</p>
<p>I try not to let.</p>
<p>And most days it&rsquo;s never a problem.</p>
<p>Any sort of like, what the kids call it now,</p>
<p>blackpilled way of thinking,</p>
<p>be my over, the umbrella which I hang under.</p>
<p>So we actually, to drag us back,</p>
<p>can we talk about Carl Gotch and Cat Tressley?</p>
<p>Because I do want to make sure I touch it.</p>
<p>I mean, what, who were?</p>
<p>Carl Gotch is.</p>
<p>Is he the greatest catch wrestler?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if he was the greatest catch wrestler ever.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t, I mean, he&rsquo;s one of them for a myriad of,</p>
<p>Carl Gotch, Billy Robinson.</p>
<p>Gotch and Robinson&rsquo;s trainer, Billy Riley.</p>
<p>So who are these figures and what did they bring to you?</p>
<p>Joe Maeda, he&rsquo;s one of the greatest catch wrestlers ever</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s responsible for Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.</p>
<p>Along with Cristal Gracie.</p>
<p>Okay, there&rsquo;s so much of things I&rsquo;d like to say here,</p>
<p>but one of the things that catch wrestling</p>
<p>seemed to espouse as a principle is that of violence.</p>
<p>I just, the tournaments I competed at,</p>
<p>the unfortunate thing,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll probably hopefully talk about it a little bit.</p>
<p>They were disorganized and the level of competition</p>
<p>was pretty low where people really sucked.</p>
<p>Pretty typical.</p>
<p>Is that typical, okay.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s, I mean, think about local run of the mill</p>
<p>Jiu Jitsu tournament versus IBJJF created,</p>
<p>you know, a vast difference, so.</p>
<p>So I, you know, but there is, to me as a human being,</p>
<p>like intellectually, philosophically,</p>
<p>it was more interesting to go to catch wrestling tournament.</p>
<p>It seemed more real and honest</p>
<p>because of the way they communicate about violence</p>
<p>and aggression. I love that.</p>
<p>So it is often more honest.</p>
<p>I think that as.</p>
<p>Who is that from?</p>
<p>Does that originate from, gosh, is that really Rob said?</p>
<p>Well, I mean, it originates from all wrestling</p>
<p>in that even Wade Chalice,</p>
<p>not a classically considered catch wrestler,</p>
<p>yet the reason why he has the world record</p>
<p>for most amount of world champions pinned</p>
<p>or the record for pins in the NCAA is because,</p>
<p>well, of course the idea is to put you on your back</p>
<p>and pin you, but there&rsquo;s no way you&rsquo;re gonna let me do that.</p>
<p>So how do I make it so that you want me to pin you?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s by you put them in excruciating pain.</p>
<p>So at the end of the day, you&rsquo;re both there.</p>
<p>You both wanna win.</p>
<p>Neither one wants to allow anything to the other.</p>
<p>So how do I get you to lose to me?</p>
<p>Well, I make it so unbearable for you</p>
<p>that you decide losing is better than staying.</p>
<p>So those two are so fascinating</p>
<p>because so coming from Russia,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s where I got it</p>
<p>or if it&rsquo;s just my own predisposition</p>
<p>is I always loved the,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s two ways to get you to want to pin yourself.</p>
<p>One is to making it so painful not to pin yourself</p>
<p>that you pin yourself or whatever.</p>
<p>And the other is, it&rsquo;s sort of like a Bruce Lee,</p>
<p>water flows, make it so easy to pin yourself.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s technique, it&rsquo;s like the elegance,</p>
<p>the ease of movement.</p>
<p>This is the Satya brothers, Vasya, Satya,</p>
<p>like the, just the elegance, the efficiency.</p>
<p>Yeah, they&rsquo;re practically like ballet watching those guys.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s incredible.</p>
<p>Satya brothers are massive.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll also caveat a little bit that like,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re approaching this from a Russian perspective,</p>
<p>Russians are quite truthful about things,</p>
<p>especially when it comes to something like combat.</p>
<p>They just, this is how it is.</p>
<p>And this is how it&rsquo;s going to be.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s honest. Yes.</p>
<p>And honesty is what I really like about catch wrestling</p>
<p>because I find that we, given any opportunity</p>
<p>for us to be dishonest for any number of reasons,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna, especially if it&rsquo;s a dishonesty</p>
<p>towards a positive, right?</p>
<p>Like, oh, well, you know, it&rsquo;s all technique</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s all this and it&rsquo;s the gentle art and blah.</p>
<p>Bro, I have rolled with ADCC world champions,</p>
<p>you know, some of the best you have ever heard of.</p>
<p>There ain&rsquo;t a lot of gentleness when it comes to like,</p>
<p>oh yeah, they wanted to sweep you and you said no.</p>
<p>And then you did, said no again.</p>
<p>And then you said no and attacked their leg.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It ceases to be all that gentle</p>
<p>because at the end of the day,</p>
<p>these dudes are strong as hell.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re flexible.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all, I mean, they&rsquo;re,</p>
<p>the difference between the athleticism</p>
<p>and the ability to actually win is a pretty wide gap.</p>
<p>The athleticism shows up,</p>
<p>but then there&rsquo;s all that other extra</p>
<p>and part of that is meanness and pain</p>
<p>and getting what you need out of it.</p>
<p>But see, there is a philosophical difference</p>
<p>in the way it&rsquo;s thought because.</p>
<p>I think some of it is just, they just in denial.</p>
<p>Like, oh, people will, they like to,</p>
<p>people like to espouse a lot of things as theory</p>
<p>and then it&rsquo;s like, okay, let me watch.</p>
<p>When they&rsquo;re, oh, you&rsquo;re not doing anything</p>
<p>about what you said right now.</p>
<p>In fact, you&rsquo;re doing the opposite.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re literally hurting that guy</p>
<p>because your shit ain&rsquo;t working</p>
<p>in the way that you&rsquo;d like it to.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re having to use strength.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re having to, it&rsquo;s one of my favorites,</p>
<p>like, oh, you&rsquo;re using too much strength.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, well, hold on.</p>
<p>Do we want people not to use strength at this point</p>
<p>to understand more of mechanics?</p>
<p>Or are you trying to tell people</p>
<p>if they use strength at all,</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re somehow bad at what they do?</p>
<p>Cause you know, it&rsquo;s not my fault.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not stronger than me.</p>
<p>But see, I&rsquo;m speaking to something else that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Well, I tend to think what it comes down to is like,</p>
<p>strength is fine until you beat me with it.</p>
<p>Then it sucks.</p>
<p>Okay, so strength is another thing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m speaking, I&rsquo;m thinking about more like anger.</p>
<p>Oh, sure.</p>
<p>Okay, so like.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen a lot of angry guys in jiu jitsu, I know that.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>Mm hmm.</p>
<p>Okay, okay, good, well, but let&rsquo;s talk about,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s talk about the highest level of competitions.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a book called Wrestling Tough.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a really good book.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s, I&rsquo;ve encountered in my life a few,</p>
<p>especially in wrestling,</p>
<p>people who really try to find a way to use anger,</p>
<p>to get really angry at their opponent.</p>
<p>Not like stupid anger, but just like.</p>
<p>Intense, pointed anger distilled into something</p>
<p>that you can use as fuel.</p>
<p>And like, I remember this story.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know where I read it.</p>
<p>Might be Wrestling Tough,</p>
<p>where a person was imagining that their opponent</p>
<p>just raped their mother, raped their girlfriend</p>
<p>or something like that,</p>
<p>to create this like method acting thing in their head</p>
<p>to be like, to snap them out of this polite interaction</p>
<p>of usual like athletic convention and like.</p>
<p>You know, that&rsquo;s a design of necessity.</p>
<p>So my anecdote for this was,</p>
<p>I was sitting with backstage before a fight,</p>
<p>not my fight.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m working with this guy and this dude is,</p>
<p>this is a world champion guy.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s competed at the highest levels.</p>
<p>And he looks at me and he goes,</p>
<p>you know, do you ever get nervous before fights?</p>
<p>And I looked at him and I went, no, I don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And he just looks at me and he&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>fuck man, I&rsquo;m so nervous.</p>
<p>You know, how do you do it, man?</p>
<p>Or, you know, I wish it could be like you.</p>
<p>And I said, you know what?</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t mean that what I&rsquo;m doing is better.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just what is necessary for me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the way I am.</p>
<p>And I told him, so this anecdote goes into another anecdote.</p>
<p>This is a Family Guy episode, I guess.</p>
<p>So, where some, another famous high level guy told me</p>
<p>about this experience with a world champion boxer in Japan.</p>
<p>And this guy would get insanely nervous and worked up</p>
<p>and anxious before his matches.</p>
<p>And he hated it and hated it and hated it.</p>
<p>And so he wanted to get rid of that feeling.</p>
<p>So he went to a hypnotist for a bunch of sessions</p>
<p>and managed to, and he goes in and next fight,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s cool as a cucumber and doesn&rsquo;t perform and loses.</p>
<p>And so what I said, going back to anecdote one,</p>
<p>was, you know, whatever is necessary for you</p>
<p>to get yourself in the best state of being right now</p>
<p>to compete, whatever that may be,</p>
<p>it could be absolute stress and fear,</p>
<p>it could be anger, it could be calmness,</p>
<p>it could be whatever.</p>
<p>But there is a, but there is a state</p>
<p>at which you need to be in to do your best.</p>
<p>And you as the individual, you have to find that.</p>
<p>Can you comment on Tyson, Mike Tyson?</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, that thing.</p>
<p>So first, so he, there&rsquo;s two things I wanna,</p>
<p>so he&rsquo;s a, in terms of fear, there&rsquo;s a clip there,</p>
<p>I think from a documentary where he talks about</p>
<p>he is like fully afraid as he walks up to the ring</p>
<p>and as he gets closer and closer and closer,</p>
<p>he gets more confident until he gets in</p>
<p>and then he&rsquo;s a god or something like that.</p>
<p>That coupled with his statement on Joe Rogan</p>
<p>that he gets aroused at the possibility of true,</p>
<p>like of hurting somebody in the ring.</p>
<p>So like he gets aroused at the violence.</p>
<p>I like it because it&rsquo;s coupled to your basically statement</p>
<p>that we need to own, to find our own unique way</p>
<p>of existing at our top level of performance.</p>
<p>And that perhaps is Mike Tyson.</p>
<p>But do you think there&rsquo;s something more deeply universal</p>
<p>to the Mike Tyson speaking to the fact</p>
<p>that he&rsquo;s aroused at the possibility of violence?</p>
<p>Yeah, I do actually.</p>
<p>Although I don&rsquo;t think that it always equates to arousal</p>
<p>for people, in fact, I would say in general, it doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I can say I&rsquo;ve never had a boner in the ring.</p>
<p>In fact, if anything, old combat cock is like,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not hanging around, we&rsquo;re leaving, we&rsquo;re going up.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re taking off, we don&rsquo;t want anything to do with this.</p>
<p>You have fun, come back to us when you have something</p>
<p>warmer, softer, smells better.</p>
<p>But the power, the feeling of aliveness,</p>
<p>yeah, I could see it.</p>
<p>Back to even the concept of the Ubermensch,</p>
<p>I feel like the states, the highest states of being</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve ever been in were in the midst of conflict.</p>
<p>I felt like that was the times,</p>
<p>those are the moments in my life where I felt like</p>
<p>I was at the highest level of being as a human in existence.</p>
<p>But yet, even being in that state was not,</p>
<p>it was not something that you could interact with</p>
<p>people that weren&rsquo;t in that state with you.</p>
<p>They wouldn&rsquo;t get it, you would almost seem,</p>
<p>and to be that way all the time,</p>
<p>either A, might drive you mad, or B, is you&rsquo;re not,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re something that&rsquo;s untenable to the rest of society.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t function with everybody else.</p>
<p>It will not work.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like you said with the Ubermensch,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s perhaps that ideal</p>
<p>is not something you can hold for long.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the very nature of it is.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, there was an example in The Spoke Zarathustra</p>
<p>about a snake being down the person&rsquo;s throat</p>
<p>and biting it, and then having this maniacal laughter</p>
<p>erupting, and to me it was, at least I read it as,</p>
<p>yeah, okay, there&rsquo;s this insane moment that isn&rsquo;t forever,</p>
<p>but that it is life and death, and the overcoming it</p>
<p>is the thing that all of a sudden gives you</p>
<p>that tapping into your highest state, right?</p>
<p>This is, man is a chasm, a tightrope</p>
<p>between man and Ubermensch.</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t wanna leave your thought about,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll call those things flourishes</p>
<p>to the aspect of Tyson&rsquo;s interpretation</p>
<p>or his expression of his feelings in combat,</p>
<p>and so I gave this anecdote to the guy,</p>
<p>and my first anecdote to that athlete I was working with,</p>
<p>and I said, you know, there isn&rsquo;t a superior way</p>
<p>in this sense.</p>
<p>There is the way that works for you.</p>
<p>That may be something you can implement to other people</p>
<p>if you find that person,</p>
<p>because we all have different personalities,</p>
<p>and to me that&rsquo;s an absolute.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna, don&rsquo;t come at me</p>
<p>with all your other fucking social sciences crap.</p>
<p>No, we have distinct personalities.</p>
<p>That personality, who you really are,</p>
<p>and this, again, Heidegger, Dasein, being authentic.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re authentic with who you are, goods and bads,</p>
<p>you will know how to create what that is,</p>
<p>and for me, violence and fighting and conflict</p>
<p>was something that always felt normal to me,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t mean normal in, like I grew up in a war zone</p>
<p>or an abusive household or something like that.</p>
<p>I just meant that, and I was a kid who was very</p>
<p>joyful and inquisitive,</p>
<p>and spent a lot of time around older people, of all things,</p>
<p>and also, while I don&rsquo;t think I have much capability</p>
<p>toward engineering, my mom said that one of the first things</p>
<p>as like a little baby,</p>
<p>when she put me in my sister&rsquo;s old crib,</p>
<p>instead of my sister who just milled about</p>
<p>and was fine with it all,</p>
<p>the first thing I did was I completely deconstructed it.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t break it.</p>
<p>I figured out how to pull it apart.</p>
<p>Curiosity about the world, and yet,</p>
<p>that wasn&rsquo;t in conflict with the idea of violence?</p>
<p>No, not at all, and so being a very joyful and nice kid,</p>
<p>but kids are kids, and if kids can find that you respond</p>
<p>maybe more easily to agitation, they will agitate you,</p>
<p>and if you should stand out in some way</p>
<p>by being taller or bigger or something, or caring,</p>
<p>especially, they will agitate you.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t really fully understand it either,</p>
<p>and so I don&rsquo;t hold anything against any of the kids</p>
<p>that used to pick on me or whatever,</p>
<p>especially at the youngest ages.</p>
<p>Man, they don&rsquo;t know shit either, so,</p>
<p>but once that line was pushed, for me it was,</p>
<p>oh, well, I was being cool.</p>
<p>Now you&rsquo;re being uncool.</p>
<p>Well, then that gives me license for everything,</p>
<p>and so, boom, we would just go at it,</p>
<p>or kids that would try to initiate a fight,</p>
<p>and I was like, okay, and being in that moment</p>
<p>of just going to town with someone else,</p>
<p>it just felt like this is, this is.</p>
<p>I belong here.</p>
<p>Yeah, it was never a problem for me.</p>
<p>In fact, if anything, what I had to understand was,</p>
<p>well, not only did I learn the hard way,</p>
<p>that it doesn&rsquo;t matter, at the end of the day,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t really matter what anybody else does</p>
<p>if your response in violence, even to their violence,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re the winner,</p>
<p>is often going to be penalized severely.</p>
<p>Society, state apparatus, they don&rsquo;t want any of that.</p>
<p>They wanna be the only arbiter of violence</p>
<p>in the world, always.</p>
<p>But I learned a very difficult lesson with that,</p>
<p>and it was really impactful in a negative way on me,</p>
<p>but also I had to learn, on an individual sense,</p>
<p>to, you need to manage violence, too,</p>
<p>because, hey, if someone attacks you</p>
<p>or starts a fight with you and you go at it,</p>
<p>okay, beating them up is one thing,</p>
<p>trying to grab a handful of broken glass from the street</p>
<p>and throw it in their face,</p>
<p>maybe that&rsquo;s a bit much at seven.</p>
<p>So you need to learn what level is necessary,</p>
<p>and you need to learn what comes with all,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the responsibility of,</p>
<p>when you enact violence, I mean, you take on something</p>
<p>when you have a responsibility for that.</p>
<p>This is the extension of your actions.</p>
<p>But as I got older, and especially as I found sports,</p>
<p>and then combat sports,</p>
<p>now this was a place for me to flourish,</p>
<p>and to the point where I was more myself in that space</p>
<p>than I was outside of it until time enough</p>
<p>where I could learn to get this back together again.</p>
<p>And I never say that I&rsquo;ll merge the two</p>
<p>or anything like that.</p>
<p>No, all what happened,</p>
<p>my journey from adolescence on to manhood,</p>
<p>a huge portion of it,</p>
<p>besides the normal finding yourself, whatever, whatever,</p>
<p>actually what it was was getting back to who I always was.</p>
<p>Getting back to the kid.</p>
<p>The curious kid, the kind kid.</p>
<p>Getting back to the guy</p>
<p>that I should have been allowed to become</p>
<p>instead of what happened under the pressures of other things.</p>
<p>And the attempt for society and certain people</p>
<p>within managerial positions to compress what that was</p>
<p>into something that they found more suitable.</p>
<p>Yeah, but those pressures allow you</p>
<p>to discover this little world, forbidden world,</p>
<p>in many ways, of violence that you could explore.</p>
<p>Through sport, you can explore it,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s more socially acceptable to explore it through sport.</p>
<p>For sure.</p>
<p>But even then, at times, it&rsquo;s socially unacceptable.</p>
<p>So I beat Sem Schilt.</p>
<p>He cut my right eyebrow.</p>
<p>I cut him and busted his nose,</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s bleeding all over me as I have an armbar on top.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m getting, you know, it&rsquo;s raining blood.</p>
<p>Quote some slayer from a lacerated Sem Schilt,</p>
<p>bleeding in his horror, creating my structures.</p>
<p>Now I shall rain him blood.</p>
<p>But I win the fight, armbar, nasty one.</p>
<p>I get on my feet, and the first thing I do</p>
<p>is I wipe all the blood off onto my hands,</p>
<p>and I lick it, and I do my thing.</p>
<p>And all the MMA journalists freaked out.</p>
<p>Dana Wise, like, man, I don&rsquo;t know about that.</p>
<p>You know, we don&rsquo;t want him doing,</p>
<p>everybody had this huge problem.</p>
<p>And then some folks would even contend,</p>
<p>oh, you know, you&rsquo;re trying to do,</p>
<p>like, no, no, no, this isn&rsquo;t planned.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think of these things.</p>
<p>This is how I really feel.</p>
<p>This is who I really am.</p>
<p>And, you know, it was even kind of comical after the fact,</p>
<p>you know, and BJ Penn was on the very card with me,</p>
<p>watching him at some point in his career all of a sudden</p>
<p>win fights and then do this licking the glove thing,</p>
<p>and everyone thinks it&rsquo;s the coolest thing ever.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, hey, fuck faces.</p>
<p>I did this in 2002 or one, 2001,</p>
<p>and BJ Penn actually back then was like,</p>
<p>dude, you&rsquo;re a badass, you&rsquo;re a killer, you know?</p>
<p>Where did that come from?</p>
<p>Because that seems like a deeply human moment.</p>
<p>I could say, I could just be, you know, goofy about it</p>
<p>and call it orgiastic to align with Titan.</p>
<p>Are we back to Mike Tyson?</p>
<p>Yeah, but Tyson, but no, no, it isn&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s beyond that.</p>
<p>Is it a celebration of human nature?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had some pretty decent orgasms</p>
<p>in my life at this point, I&rsquo;m 43.</p>
<p>So, but no, none have ever compared to that.</p>
<p>Like I said, it is a feeling of highest being to me.</p>
<p>And I&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s your Ubermensch moment.</p>
<p>This is where I feel like the restrictions</p>
<p>of general existence in society are gone.</p>
<p>And I get to fully live in a state</p>
<p>that feels more meaningful, of the most meaning.</p>
<p>You know, I think of it as life and death.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just, it is the way I&rsquo;m built.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t have, I&rsquo;ve never had any problem</p>
<p>applying violence.</p>
<p>Like it doesn&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t know where it comes from</p>
<p>or how you would define it or whatever,</p>
<p>if you want to stick me under in a psychologist chair,</p>
<p>but like I don&rsquo;t, there&rsquo;s a part of me</p>
<p>that can just like, no, if I&rsquo;m gonna apply,</p>
<p>I can apply violence to any level and be okay with it.</p>
<p>And it doesn&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t lose sleep.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t bother me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a problem.</p>
<p>It was me learning how to fully understand violence,</p>
<p>humans, and the broader perspective</p>
<p>that allowed me to think about things</p>
<p>and like, well, what do I really want to accomplish</p>
<p>with my actions in the world just on a whole?</p>
<p>You know, not compartmentalizing my sporting career.</p>
<p>Even when I get in the ring,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have any mercy generally.</p>
<p>And if I do, it&rsquo;s because I make a really deliberate attempt</p>
<p>to be in a state where I can have mercy.</p>
<p>If I just go in there to fight with everything I got,</p>
<p>there is zero mercy.</p>
<p>The natural state of violence.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing, there&rsquo;s nothing that will hold me back</p>
<p>other than the referee and that&rsquo;s that.</p>
<p>You know, I know I agreed to be allowed to do</p>
<p>and not to do, but within that, no.</p>
<p>And I expect it to be done to me.</p>
<p>But in terms of values, in terms of seeing what,</p>
<p>to me, violence is just yet another canvas</p>
<p>that humans can paint beautifully on.</p>
<p>Clearly, I mean, we have venerated the violent.</p>
<p>There are communists that venerate the violent</p>
<p>on their behalf.</p>
<p>There are national socialists</p>
<p>that venerate the violent there.</p>
<p>And then if you remove it from an ideological perspective,</p>
<p>we venerate the violent when they&rsquo;re a hero.</p>
<p>We venerate the violent in our religion.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, I guess some people venerate the violence</p>
<p>of Yahweh and Sodom and Gomorrah, right?</p>
<p>So, or do we say Jehovah?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Is there, you&rsquo;ve already mentioned one,</p>
<p>but is there a fight where you&rsquo;ve achieved</p>
<p>the highest of heights for your own personal being</p>
<p>just when you look within yourself</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re the proudest of,</p>
<p>or maybe it was your most beautiful creation?</p>
<p>Is there something that stands out?</p>
<p>Yeah, there are a few, actually.</p>
<p>Fighting Semishield and a rematch.</p>
<p>Well, the first one was pretty good, too.</p>
<p>But the rematch was, I was suffering,</p>
<p>I had suffered prior, the week prior,</p>
<p>to food poisoning.</p>
<p>And so while my abs are looking all right,</p>
<p>I, in the ring, didn&rsquo;t have the power that I expected to.</p>
<p>And I was struggling in ways,</p>
<p>in some of the grappling with the submission stuff</p>
<p>that I hadn&rsquo;t accounted for.</p>
<p>Just exhaustion or mental exhaustion?</p>
<p>No, I mean, just physical,</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t back up to 100% in terms of just power output.</p>
<p>And Semi was, well, he&rsquo;s always seven foot tall.</p>
<p>But this time he was, the first time I fought him,</p>
<p>he was 260, or 257, or 260 something, something like that.</p>
<p>This time he was like 290.</p>
<p>And so he was a significantly bigger cat.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s a big dude.</p>
<p>And I just remember being up against the ropes with him,</p>
<p>changing levels, trying to take him down.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s fighting, and he&rsquo;s hippin'.</p>
<p>And I just thought in my head,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no fuckin way I&rsquo;m gonna lose this fight.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no way, you are not going to beat me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not gonna happen.</p>
<p>And I armbarred him, the other arm.</p>
<p>Even out of the fact he&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>man, I really wanted to get you for that,</p>
<p>I wanted to get that match back.</p>
<p>And then you fuckin got my other arm, dick.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, eh, dude, I still love you though.</p>
<p>You know, and that.</p>
<p>But the whole time you&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>so this has to do with the dichotomy</p>
<p>of you&rsquo;re feeling your worst.</p>
<p>And having to overcome.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like literally mentally telling yourself</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no way.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no fuckin way I&rsquo;m gonna lose this fight.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s even my last bare knuckle match.</p>
<p>And getting in the ring and fighting bare knuckle boxing</p>
<p>for the first time.</p>
<p>And just thinking, just being in a great state.</p>
<p>And just looking so forward to seeing.</p>
<p>I mean, I called someone.</p>
<p>I was talking to them the night before.</p>
<p>And I said, yeah, well, I video called you</p>
<p>because this face might not look like this</p>
<p>when I see you next.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re just like, ooh, uh, okay.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not just like empty trash talk.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like a clarity of mind and a seriousness about.</p>
<p>I go, I might die.</p>
<p>Most, pretty high chance of being deformed some way.</p>
<p>So, but fuck it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really care.</p>
<p>Are you, do you think about,</p>
<p>are you accepting your own death?</p>
<p>Yes, 100%.</p>
<p>Yeah, I, in fact, and that&rsquo;s, in a strange way,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s partially what makes it so elevated</p>
<p>in terms of my sense of feeling.</p>
<p>By being able to have death at my side, it feels good.</p>
<p>And to be there and to think that this could be the one,</p>
<p>like, why not, you know?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a religious person at all,</p>
<p>even though I very much have to seem,</p>
<p>it seems to bang on the drum about the usefulness</p>
<p>or understanding the usefulness of religion for people.</p>
<p>But, you know, if I gotta do something,</p>
<p>then yeah, put me in Valhalla, man.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna be anywhere else.</p>
<p>Nothing else seems like a good place for me to be.</p>
<p>I wanna fight all day long and feast all night.</p>
<p>You know, it sounds great.</p>
<p>I saw you throw your hat into the ring of Fader Emelianenko.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>He got COVID, I guess.</p>
<p>I hope he overcomes it and comes out just as good,</p>
<p>if not better.</p>
<p>Epic with that.</p>
<p>Did I understand correctly that might be his last fight?</p>
<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s my understanding.</p>
<p>And it would be epic as hell.</p>
<p>And it would be epic as hell</p>
<p>because the person that I wanna give my most to</p>
<p>is a person that I respect,</p>
<p>especially at this long career of mine</p>
<p>and getting at this twilight years.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like two warriors.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the thing about even this going in there</p>
<p>with the aspect of being with death and all that</p>
<p>is that when that person is in there,</p>
<p>they are my brother with me in this.</p>
<p>And so when you give me your best,</p>
<p>even if I win dominant fashion,</p>
<p>but if you show up and you&rsquo;re as authentic</p>
<p>and being here as I am, then I love you.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m glad for you to be here.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re in this together.</p>
<p>And at this point, your loss or my loss or whatever</p>
<p>is no less deserving of veneration than the win.</p>
<p>Like we&rsquo;re here in this.</p>
<p>And so to be in the ring with F√ºhrer</p>
<p>and to venerate him in win or defeat,</p>
<p>to be in there with someone like that is, to me,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so rare, so.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s incredible how the ultimate violence</p>
<p>is coupled with love or respect.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s weird how the competition in its violent form</p>
<p>is also a veneration of just human connection.</p>
<p>Human connection.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also the removal.</p>
<p>I feel like it&rsquo;s the purest, one of the purest ways,</p>
<p>purest, most honest places a person can exist.</p>
<p>That line in Fight Club, you don&rsquo;t know really</p>
<p>who you are until you&rsquo;ve been in a fight.</p>
<p>I mean, I believe that.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve seen so many examples of people</p>
<p>trying to portray themselves as one thing.</p>
<p>And then in the ring, you see who they really are.</p>
<p>Or even when they&rsquo;re trying to portray themselves</p>
<p>as one thing and they&rsquo;re winning,</p>
<p>the crowd, at times, will see who they really are</p>
<p>and still hate them, you know?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, well, I said all the good things.</p>
<p>Bro, don&rsquo;t work that way.</p>
<p>Yeah, but speaking of F√ºhrer,</p>
<p>if we take you out of the picture,</p>
<p>who are the greatest mixed martial arts fighters</p>
<p>of all time?</p>
<p>I feel.</p>
<p>You out of the picture.</p>
<p>As a cop out, to some degree,</p>
<p>I feel like we need a little bit more time, you know?</p>
<p>So, to see how this unfolds.</p>
<p>Because you gotta compare a lot of things.</p>
<p>And I, did I, I think I&rsquo;m.</p>
<p>Like centuries?</p>
<p>I did an interview.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know about centuries.</p>
<p>But that would help if we can keep accurate records</p>
<p>and not allow too much bias to fall in.</p>
<p>Too much propaganda.</p>
<p>The victor&rsquo;s still there, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, but I made an argument.</p>
<p>I was in, I get a, it was a interview</p>
<p>with an MMA outlet of some sort.</p>
<p>And I can&rsquo;t recall who it was.</p>
<p>But, oh, it was an argument about</p>
<p>will the winner of Cain Velasquez versus Steve Amiocik</p>
<p>be the greatest MMA heavyweight of all time?</p>
<p>And I said, fucking no way.</p>
<p>Oh no, it was Cormier Amiocik.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what it was.</p>
<p>I said, absolutely not.</p>
<p>Not even close.</p>
<p>And I said, these guys need a bit more time</p>
<p>to see how things go.</p>
<p>And also how things go for some of their opponents.</p>
<p>And like, there&rsquo;s more factors than just this one fight.</p>
<p>It really is.</p>
<p>And I go, and when you wanna weigh these people,</p>
<p>even if let&rsquo;s say, we&rsquo;ll bring Alistair Overeem</p>
<p>into the end of the equation.</p>
<p>Okay, you judge him on what you know now,</p>
<p>what he&rsquo;s done for you lately, okay?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Which is a very myopic way of doing it.</p>
<p>What has he done over his career?</p>
<p>K1 champion.</p>
<p>He was a champion in DREAM.</p>
<p>He, Strike Force, blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p>His overall record.</p>
<p>The entirety of all the different opponents he&rsquo;s fought.</p>
<p>And I just sit back and I go, okay, he&rsquo;s not the UFC champ.</p>
<p>But his accolades, his merits,</p>
<p>in some ways, actually stand up higher</p>
<p>than Cormier&rsquo;s and Amiocik&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>So what about the moments, do you give much value</p>
<p>to the special moments, like the highest heights</p>
<p>you rise to, not in terms of records or the strikes landed,</p>
<p>but just creating a magical moment in a fight?</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t have to be even a championship fight,</p>
<p>but just, Conor McGregor is an example</p>
<p>of somebody who creates a narrative,</p>
<p>who creates a story, who creates a drama,</p>
<p>and a special magic happens, even if it&rsquo;s like, not with.</p>
<p>Myth is greater than reality.</p>
<p>And that is always the case.</p>
<p>But do you.</p>
<p>And so I understand that so very much,</p>
<p>and it takes an asshole like me to poo poo on your myth.</p>
<p>They at least get you, at the end of the day,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not gonna abandon your myth,</p>
<p>but perhaps temper it with the facts and logic.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re not a fan of myth?</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m an absolute massive fan of myth.</p>
<p>But you prefer facts and logic.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like when I, no, I mean.</p>
<p>I like saying facts and logic, because people,</p>
<p>I also, I am not a materialist in that sense.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that materialism can solve for everything.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not enough.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not robust enough, I&rsquo;m sorry.</p>
<p>If facts and logic and, or reason,</p>
<p>as the Enlightenment scholars all thought,</p>
<p>including Marx, was enough for people,</p>
<p>then we would never, we wouldn&rsquo;t have any religions.</p>
<p>We wouldn&rsquo;t have any, like there would be no,</p>
<p>we wouldn&rsquo;t have narratives and myths</p>
<p>and all this kind of stuff.</p>
<p>It would not, it just, I&rsquo;m sorry, there is no,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s nothing about history that supports the idea</p>
<p>that rationality will overcome all.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something about Ben Shapiro&rsquo;s facts</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t care about your feelings,</p>
<p>that feels to be miss, feels to be missing</p>
<p>something fundamental about human nature.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not clear to me exactly what is missing.</p>
<p>To give old Ben a fair shake.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know Ben Shapiro.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really listen to Ben Shapiro,</p>
<p>not against Ben Shapiro.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;m not here to say anything</p>
<p>particularly bad about him.</p>
<p>Although I will say at one time,</p>
<p>Tom Arnold was seemingly trying to pick</p>
<p>an actionable fight with Ben Shapiro.</p>
<p>In the ring.</p>
<p>Or in the. Somewhere, yeah.</p>
<p>And I just, and I actually responded,</p>
<p>I like, and I tried to get him to clarify,</p>
<p>I said, hey, are you saying that you want to fight</p>
<p>Ben Shapiro, that you&rsquo;re looking to actually,</p>
<p>because I was waiting for him to say something</p>
<p>and then I can be like, okay, well,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s one thing to want to get into a fight with someone.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s another thing to go pick on a little tiny,</p>
<p>you know, guy like Ben, who&rsquo;s much smaller than you</p>
<p>and doesn&rsquo;t train or whatever, but you know,</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s not me, I can find someone your size</p>
<p>and you can go fight him.</p>
<p>You know, don&rsquo;t be a, basically,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t be a bully piece of shit.</p>
<p>Yeah. You know, which by the way,</p>
<p>Tom Arnold, you are a mental midget.</p>
<p>You are never going to be able to compete</p>
<p>even with Ben Shapiro in an argument</p>
<p>on any level about anything.</p>
<p>Oh, intellectual argument.</p>
<p>Yeah, intellectual argument.</p>
<p>Maybe you can scream louder than him, but whatever.</p>
<p>But nevertheless, in the discussion of greatness in fighting.</p>
<p>I think you need to look at some of the numbers.</p>
<p>You need to look at some of the numbers.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s the magic.</p>
<p>There is some context also in that,</p>
<p>where did Alistair Overeem fight?</p>
<p>Oh, he fought in Pride, where you could soccer kick people</p>
<p>and stomp their head and this and that.</p>
<p>And so the game environment is actually different too.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s more uncertainty, there&rsquo;s more chaos in Pride,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s more.</p>
<p>Go back a little further and go like,</p>
<p>what about the guys that used to,</p>
<p>like Dan Severn fought bare knuckle,</p>
<p>head butts, the whole nine.</p>
<p>You beat Dan Severn, right?</p>
<p>I did beat Dan Severn.</p>
<p>That was killing an idol, so to speak.</p>
<p>Although I didn&rsquo;t really kill him because I still love him.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s still an, I mean, he&rsquo;s still responsible</p>
<p>for inspiration along this whole pathway.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s meeting your God and then putting a knife in it,</p>
<p>I guess.</p>
<p>Realizing they&rsquo;re human and then bringing them down</p>
<p>to your level.</p>
<p>Exactly, but also there&rsquo;s a huge misconception there</p>
<p>and that is that I could bring,</p>
<p>maybe I could bring Dan Severn down to my level,</p>
<p>but I couldn&rsquo;t bring his mustache down to my level.</p>
<p>It is of mythic proportions and&hellip;</p>
<p>Greater than yours.</p>
<p>Your facial hair is greater than yours.</p>
<p>My facial hair is creating its own legacy,</p>
<p>but it is not Dan Severn mustache level</p>
<p>or now Don Fry mustache.</p>
<p>So Don Fry mustache, Dan Severn mustache.</p>
<p>Now you have like Shia versus Sunni.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You think there&rsquo;ll be a Karl Marx painting</p>
<p>of Josh Barnett one day with the beard</p>
<p>and is that basically what you&rsquo;re trying to say?</p>
<p>I hope so.</p>
<p>I will actually comb my hair, unlike Marx, but&hellip;</p>
<p>Chaos has a charm to it.</p>
<p>It does, it does.</p>
<p>I mean, we all thought Doc Brown in Back to the Future</p>
<p>was quite charming.</p>
<p>You have to throw that into the calculation</p>
<p>where they fought.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>This is the interesting thing.</p>
<p>And the rules that they fought under.</p>
<p>Some guy like Eerov Chanchin won a 32 man tournament</p>
<p>or something like that.</p>
<p>I go, okay.</p>
<p>Steepa and Daniel Cormier are awesome</p>
<p>and they will for sure be revered for their careers.</p>
<p>100%.</p>
<p>Can you say that they&rsquo;re particularly even better overall</p>
<p>than Eerov Chanchin?</p>
<p>Well, maybe one of them could have beat them.</p>
<p>Maybe one of them wouldn&rsquo;t have.</p>
<p>Maybe Eerov would have got them</p>
<p>with the knuckles right away.</p>
<p>Well, maybe if they fought them in pride,</p>
<p>they wouldn&rsquo;t have won.</p>
<p>Maybe if they fought them bare knuckle, they wouldn&rsquo;t won.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s something about the chaos,</p>
<p>like do you put Royce Gracie in the top 10?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something about&hellip;</p>
<p>Top 10 of all time in terms of competitors is capable.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d have to think about that.</p>
<p>Maybe not, but I put Royce Gracie as like pyramid level.</p>
<p>Like, wow, dude, what an amazing man.</p>
<p>Yeah, he&rsquo;s so important.</p>
<p>Absolutely, incredibly important.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s something about stepping into,</p>
<p>like fighting another human being</p>
<p>under all the uncertainty that the early UFCs had.</p>
<p>I mean, you don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Yup.</p>
<p>What is going to happen?</p>
<p>And coupled that with not much money.</p>
<p>Yup.</p>
<p>All of it.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So the purity of it too.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something about money.</p>
<p>I mean, I guess it&rsquo;s shit for that cat post world,</p>
<p>but that ruins the purity of the violence.</p>
<p>Yeah, people given the opportunity for&hellip;</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>The bigger things get, the more&hellip;</p>
<p>I love the fact that fighting has opened up</p>
<p>to such a degree that the career business side of it,</p>
<p>because I absolutely distinctly separate the two.</p>
<p>The business side of it has opened up</p>
<p>to give me far more possibilities,</p>
<p>opened way more doors for me than I ever intended it to.</p>
<p>Whereas the athlete side of things has,</p>
<p>if anything, just gotten substantially worse, I would say.</p>
<p>And some of this is due to the nature of all games</p>
<p>will be learned, will be gamed</p>
<p>without even the rules being broken.</p>
<p>And once that&rsquo;s figured out, you need to make an adjustment.</p>
<p>No adjustments have been made.</p>
<p>So the game just appears to be the same game</p>
<p>over and over and over and over and over again</p>
<p>on ESPN+, on whatever, on whatever, on whatever.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t really matter which night you watch.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same game constantly.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not because the athletes are worse or better.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because they have had that game structure long enough</p>
<p>that they figured out what do you do</p>
<p>to be the most successful at it?</p>
<p>What is the highest percentage way of approaching it,</p>
<p>essentially, even if you&rsquo;re not thinking of percentages?</p>
<p>What were the&hellip;</p>
<p>If we take a step back, it&rsquo;s really fascinating</p>
<p>to think about the early UFCs.</p>
<p>Did you fight Dan Severn in the UFC?</p>
<p>I fought him in Super Brawl.</p>
<p>Super Brawl, so that was in the early, early days,</p>
<p>your undefeated&hellip; 2000.</p>
<p>What were those early days, let&rsquo;s say,</p>
<p>of mixed martial arts like?</p>
<p>Let me tell you the day of high adventure.</p>
<p>Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.</p>
<p>Yeah, it is.</p>
<p>It was so much fun.</p>
<p>And it made you feel absolutely like you were a part of a novel,</p>
<p>a comic book.</p>
<p>I mean, I would love to transcribe my experiences</p>
<p>as what I consider a second generation MMA athlete,</p>
<p>except I&rsquo;m way too sensitive to anybody&rsquo;s personal,</p>
<p>any things that are not even to&hellip;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a gossipy person.</p>
<p>I really do believe that small people talk about others.</p>
<p>Big people talk about ideas.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s just some stories that you can&rsquo;t tell</p>
<p>without telling the whole story.</p>
<p>And there are so many amazing stories that could be told.</p>
<p>People being at their best, people being at their worst.</p>
<p>Yeah, the whole niche of gossip.</p>
<p>Is there something you could speak to the chaos of the time?</p>
<p>Oh, 100%.</p>
<p>Well, okay, so we at AMC got connected to somebody</p>
<p>that was throwing an event in Nampa, Idaho,</p>
<p>and we all piled into this.</p>
<p>And Matt Humes, Subaru Wagon, and we jammed out.</p>
<p>And we left Kirkland and we headed over to Idaho,</p>
<p>only to find out that there was nothing really put in place.</p>
<p>Nothing really put in place, it was absolute disrepair and chaos.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t have a rain, they didn&rsquo;t have this.</p>
<p>It was such a bullshit adventure.</p>
<p>But we were like, well, there&rsquo;s hardly anywhere to fight.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s tough to find these opportunities.</p>
<p>So, okay, well, how about this?</p>
<p>Whoever is here to fight and is willing,</p>
<p>all right, well, since there&rsquo;s no venue, there&rsquo;s no this,</p>
<p>whatever, we all got gloves, we got mouthpieces,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll just go to the park, as long as we still get paid.</p>
<p>And so folks were kind of like, I don&rsquo;t know about that.</p>
<p>The guy I was gonna fight was, he finally gets information</p>
<p>on who I actually am, and I was undefeated at the time.</p>
<p>I think I had fought Super Brawl 13</p>
<p>and already won that tournament.</p>
<p>And so he&rsquo;s like, yeah, I had no clue.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so glad we didn&rsquo;t fight, you would have murdered me.</p>
<p>What a setup.</p>
<p>And eventually Matt had to strong arm the guy</p>
<p>and get our money that we were supposed to all get</p>
<p>and drive back.</p>
<p>And because his whole position was,</p>
<p>well, there ain&rsquo;t no fucking way,</p>
<p>we drove all the way out here for free.</p>
<p>This is on you, you fucked this up, not my problem.</p>
<p>But what is my problem is the lack of cash in my account.</p>
<p>So fix it, or me fighting my first organized fight</p>
<p>against an AMC guy on 11 days notice</p>
<p>through a connection to an old wrestling coach I had.</p>
<p>And I just gathered up with all my old martial arts instructor</p>
<p>that I had worked with and we grappled in his apartment.</p>
<p>We did tie pads in the park.</p>
<p>I ran a couple miles every day and then,</p>
<p>all right, boom, show it up.</p>
<p>Won my fight by front choke in two minutes.</p>
<p>And then Matt goes, okay, well, hey, you did really great.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;d like you to come back and fight again in the summer.</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>
<p>Okay, go back off the university.</p>
<p>And then I think, hmm, well, that fight didn&rsquo;t go exactly</p>
<p>as how I wanted it to.</p>
<p>So I gotta find a way to get more experience.</p>
<p>I would literally fight people in the university,</p>
<p>like rec center on the old wrestling mats,</p>
<p>as they didn&rsquo;t know I had a wrestling team.</p>
<p>I would find anyone doing martial arts,</p>
<p>anyone talking about getting into street fights,</p>
<p>anyone, whatever, and just basically go,</p>
<p>oh, you ever watch UFC?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, that stuff&rsquo;s cool.</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>
<p>Oh, man, I&rsquo;m super into it, man, it&rsquo;s badass.</p>
<p>Rad.</p>
<p>So would you wanna fight?</p>
<p>Would you wanna fight? I mean, it was way easier picking fights</p>
<p>than it was, you know, getting a girlfriend.</p>
<p>So I just, you know, path least resistance.</p>
<p>I think it might be useful for us</p>
<p>to get some advice from you.</p>
<p>Yeah, all right.</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;ve accomplished,</p>
<p>for the journey of a martial artist first,</p>
<p>if you accomplish some of the greatest accolades</p>
<p>there is in the sport, if somebody who&rsquo;s starting out now,</p>
<p>or early on in their journey, what advice would you give</p>
<p>on how to become a martial artist, catch wrestler, a fighter?</p>
<p>Well, I mean, really what it comes down to</p>
<p>is do it because you love it.</p>
<p>Do it for that reason and that reason alone.</p>
<p>Most people that get into this</p>
<p>and attempt to make any sort of professional inroads with it,</p>
<p>you are not going to be the world champion.</p>
<p>You probably will never even fight for a belt</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re probably not going to net make money at this.</p>
<p>So don&rsquo;t do it for those reasons.</p>
<p>Do it for the reason of the passion.</p>
<p>Do it for the reason to be the absolute best</p>
<p>that you can be, whatever that ends up being.</p>
<p>You might at best only be mediocre,</p>
<p>but you won&rsquo;t even be mediocre if you don&rsquo;t do it</p>
<p>like you really mean it.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>The passion, look, where is the kernel of the passion,</p>
<p>would you say, is it in the learning process itself,</p>
<p>the improvement?</p>
<p>I think it really depends on the person, right?</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s some people that really love the fact of,</p>
<p>they feel like they&rsquo;re growing, right?</p>
<p>Well to power, you&rsquo;re growing, growing stronger,</p>
<p>growing better.</p>
<p>The idea of eliminating weakness.</p>
<p>So, to which I&rsquo;ll quickly define weakness</p>
<p>as just like things that weaken you,</p>
<p>not like being physically weak.</p>
<p>Sure, you could call that weakness,</p>
<p>but maybe you&rsquo;re not meant to be a super strong guy.</p>
<p>But choosing to be weak is really a different story</p>
<p>other than just like,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re all deficient in some way or another.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s neither here nor there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a matter of what you decide to do with it.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s different from strength and weakness,</p>
<p>at least the way I look at it.</p>
<p>Like strength is choosing,</p>
<p>regardless of the difficulty, to make improvements.</p>
<p>Strength is even choosing to acknowledge that you do lack.</p>
<p>And accept it and then make a decision what to do with it.</p>
<p>Yeah, but there&rsquo;s also, there&rsquo;s a bunch of stuff</p>
<p>that just like you said, it&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re drawn to.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an honesty to just grappling</p>
<p>that it seems more real than anything else you can do.</p>
<p>Sure, well and also.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where the passion and love can come from.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, being in an environment, hopefully,</p>
<p>that is as true as possible, would be a starter.</p>
<p>So, it&rsquo;s hard to be a bullshit person</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re literally trying to tear each other&rsquo;s arms off.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You know, you really sort of see who somebody is.</p>
<p>I also feel like you really get to see somebody who,</p>
<p>there are a couple instances where you really see</p>
<p>who people are on the mats and in the bedroom.</p>
<p>So, even the aspect of self betterment,</p>
<p>growth along a path.</p>
<p>I mean, hell, that&rsquo;s part of the divisive capture</p>
<p>for martial arts as a business.</p>
<p>Give you a belt, put a stripe on your belt.</p>
<p>Each of these iterations cost 20 bucks.</p>
<p>So, you know.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a benefit to that too.</p>
<p>I really enjoyed the progression of belts.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>You know, a bit of it is OCD or whatever,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re enjoying the recognition, your growth</p>
<p>when you feel, when you&rsquo;re made to feel,</p>
<p>when I think genuinely you do earn it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I agree.</p>
<p>It makes complete sense to me.</p>
<p>It just, it&rsquo;s anything that is, has a goodness</p>
<p>in its purity can also have a detriment in its perversion.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a value to competition.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve gotten some shit in the past for saying this.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve gotten the most value in giving everything I have</p>
<p>to try to win and lose.</p>
<p>So like, I&rsquo;ve gotten, I remember most of the matches</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve lost and I think that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve gotten the most</p>
<p>from the sport is losing.</p>
<p>Think about it.</p>
<p>I mean, if you really think about it,</p>
<p>what makes you wanna actually, in detail,</p>
<p>go over what happened?</p>
<p>Oh, it&rsquo;s the time when you didn&rsquo;t get what you wanted.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a time when you gave it everything you had</p>
<p>and you came up short.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Or failed miserably.</p>
<p>Okay, so.</p>
<p>Especially if you&rsquo;re embarrassed in some way.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s usually the only time people, again, calamity,</p>
<p>is the impetus for them to actually turn around</p>
<p>and go, who the fuck am I?</p>
<p>What am I doing and why am I doing it?</p>
<p>Instead of naturally going, hmm, okay, well I won.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>What was it the cause?</p>
<p>And so I think part of my success is that when I win,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m brutal.</p>
<p>When I lose, I&rsquo;m brutal.</p>
<p>And there is no in between.</p>
<p>So I remember losing the rematch against Noguera.</p>
<p>And I still feel like it was a bullshit call.</p>
<p>I feel like I won that fight.</p>
<p>But my opinion is that, and this even came up,</p>
<p>so one of the coaches in the back was like,</p>
<p>oh, you did great, don&rsquo;t feel bad, blah, blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p>And I go, no, fuck that.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t finish him.</p>
<p>I allowed the referees to make a judge,</p>
<p>a decision that I think is incorrect and bad,</p>
<p>but that came because I didn&rsquo;t take him out.</p>
<p>Fuck that, no, no.</p>
<p>He won, he&rsquo;s gonna get more money,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s gonna get more recognition,</p>
<p>blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p>I accept all this and it&rsquo;s not okay.</p>
<p>And I need to, when I get a chance to fight him again,</p>
<p>I gotta figure out how to take this guy out.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna say forever.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not trying to put him six feet underground.</p>
<p>Well, when I fight, yes I am.</p>
<p>But the point being, I need to find a way to,</p>
<p>this is definitive.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t get to say shit about it</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m the only one who can stand right now.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the way it&rsquo;s gotta be.</p>
<p>Anything less than that is not good enough.</p>
<p>And even if I achieve that, then I gotta figure out,</p>
<p>okay, it&rsquo;s not a given.</p>
<p>How did I get to this point?</p>
<p>How did I make that happen?</p>
<p>Was it simply because of his own mistakes</p>
<p>or was it because of my successful action?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s always self critical.</p>
<p>Always, constantly.</p>
<p>You love movies.</p>
<p>I read this somewhere.</p>
<p>You mentioned Blade Runner is a favorite.</p>
<p>Number one of all time, the final cut.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my go to.</p>
<p>So you would say Blade Runner</p>
<p>is the greatest movie of all time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of the greatest movies of all time.</p>
<p>And it is my number.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s in the top?</p>
<p>My top five, Blade Runner, final cut.</p>
<p>This is the original Blade Runner.</p>
<p>And I used to own, on tape, the original.</p>
<p>VHS?</p>
<p>The original cut, yeah.</p>
<p>And I had the director&rsquo;s cut on DVD.</p>
<p>Why Blade Runner, by the way?</p>
<p>What connects you to it?</p>
<p>As a kid, I just thought it was so cool.</p>
<p>There was something about it that really spoke to me.</p>
<p>The whole cyberpunk landscapes</p>
<p>and this guy chasing down rogue androids, replicants,</p>
<p>and all this.</p>
<p>Is it just the entire cyberpunk universe</p>
<p>or is it just robots as well?</p>
<p>No, I mean, the cyberpunk universe is part of it.</p>
<p>On the surface, I&rsquo;ve always tended towards</p>
<p>dark subject matter.</p>
<p>Things that are of the dark, so to speak,</p>
<p>are things that I&rsquo;ve always been gravitated towards.</p>
<p>I think maybe part of it is that things that are darker</p>
<p>are more accepting and more upfront with death.</p>
<p>And perhaps, I think, maybe that is what was&hellip;</p>
<p>Yeah, somehow more honest, perhaps.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s also the aspect of rebelliousness, usually.</p>
<p>Like, I was never one to wanna just do</p>
<p>what somebody told me to do, you know?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sitting around trying to always be</p>
<p>such a radical individual that I can&rsquo;t take orders.</p>
<p>No, in fact, I&rsquo;m more than willing to take orders</p>
<p>from somebody that I feel is competent and has merit</p>
<p>and reason behind what they&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>and makes like, okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m 100% for it.</p>
<p>Not only can I take orders,</p>
<p>I will help you achieve whatever it is</p>
<p>if I think it&rsquo;s worthwhile, even at my own expense.</p>
<p>But to get to that point is a rarity.</p>
<p>Like, it&rsquo;s just not a given.</p>
<p>And so you can even imagine being a grade school teacher</p>
<p>and this kid doesn&rsquo;t respect you</p>
<p>and he doesn&rsquo;t really think you&rsquo;re that smart.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t really appreciate that.</p>
<p>So cyberpunk is number one.</p>
<p>What else is there?</p>
<p>Cyberpunk is kind of number one.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an environment I love, but at the same time,</p>
<p>Conan the Barbarian by John Milius</p>
<p>is one of my favorite films of all time.</p>
<p>And you know, that&rsquo;s such a pure film in a way.</p>
<p>Like, the motivations are pure.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re very easy to follow, but not lacking in depth.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s not just explosions and teal and orange.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more on the human condition and I love it.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s shot incredibly well.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s got an incredible soundtrack.</p>
<p>Yeah, I fucking love it.</p>
<p>But with Blade Runner also in a deeper sense,</p>
<p>you know, again, the human condition.</p>
<p>You know, you start seeing like, what is being?</p>
<p>What is being human?</p>
<p>You know, how does this relate to if you can make it</p>
<p>and you can tell it what to do,</p>
<p>at what point is it like you should or you shouldn&rsquo;t?</p>
<p>You know, why do you get to determine what&rsquo;s alive</p>
<p>and what&rsquo;s not?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s a life that should be allowed to live and what isn&rsquo;t?</p>
<p>And what would be the strain of being Roy Batty</p>
<p>and seeing all these incredible moments</p>
<p>that with his passing will no longer exist?</p>
<p>Especially if he hasn&rsquo;t had a chance</p>
<p>to put that flame into another torch, so to speak.</p>
<p>If he hasn&rsquo;t written them down,</p>
<p>if he hasn&rsquo;t passed them down to somebody else.</p>
<p>Gone like tears in the rain.</p>
<p>Like tears in the rain, that scene is incredible.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s funny, because those two universes</p>
<p>are very different, Conan and the Barbarian and Cyberpunk.</p>
<p>Is there, that makes me curious about</p>
<p>what else might be in the list at the top.</p>
<p>Well, let me think.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a pretty.</p>
<p>Do you like the Godfather type of universe?</p>
<p>No, no, I mean, I&rsquo;m sure the Godfather,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never actually even watched the whole Godfather.</p>
<p>No, but also like, was it Casino, Goodfellas?</p>
<p>Goodfellas is a good movie, but no, that&rsquo;s not in my top.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good flick, but it doesn&rsquo;t really do it for me.</p>
<p>If people really wanna get into this a little more,</p>
<p>I did make a list of 100 of my favorite movies</p>
<p>on my Facebook fan page.</p>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p>Do you remember what like, some of the top.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, like Blazing Saddles is on there,</p>
<p>Rage of the Lost Ark,</p>
<p>Valhalla Rising by Nicholas from Winding Refn,</p>
<p>Maniac by William Lustig.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a 1980 gnarly video nasty horror movie</p>
<p>about a serial killer who murders women and scalps them.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s gnarly as hell and very brutal and very bleak</p>
<p>and very, I mean, it&rsquo;s the kind of thing</p>
<p>that like a lot of people would have</p>
<p>a real hard time watching.</p>
<p>But one, again, I like things that are dark,</p>
<p>but two, I thought the performances were fantastic</p>
<p>in this film and they really got out,</p>
<p>I think what the underlying thing was,</p>
<p>and it was a guy who was basically just like run amok</p>
<p>by the overbearing mother, Jungian archetype.</p>
<p>And it, she was, she imparted her insanity into him.</p>
<p>And he, but yet there is this aspect you could see</p>
<p>of him wanting to try and actually be able</p>
<p>to be in the world and have love</p>
<p>and have a feminine companionship</p>
<p>to go with his masculine aspect.</p>
<p>But he had no way of understanding</p>
<p>how to really make that happen.</p>
<p>And he had a complete negative connotation to the feminine.</p>
<p>So his struggle with, and there&rsquo;s a little part</p>
<p>in the movie where he somehow comes across</p>
<p>this model or something, and they actually,</p>
<p>he starts to feel like maybe he might be able</p>
<p>to actually have a relationship with somebody</p>
<p>and it goes somewhere.</p>
<p>But yeah, even the Elijah Wood remake I felt was</p>
<p>really well done and captured most of the essence</p>
<p>of what the movie was about.</p>
<p>But I still feel like the original</p>
<p>by William Lustig is the best.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the greatest love movie of all time?</p>
<p>Greatest love movie of all time.</p>
<p>So like something where love is, I mean,</p>
<p>I suppose love underlies most of these movies,</p>
<p>and especially like The Dark.</p>
<p>I mean hell, Takashi Miike&rsquo;s films are all about family</p>
<p>of all things, as bonkers as those movies are.</p>
<p>They, the general theme is family almost entirely</p>
<p>in all of his films.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s very, I mean, even you can argue later on.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s everywhere.</p>
<p>Greatest love film of all time.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, I mean, is Excalibur a film about love?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s Excalibur about?</p>
<p>King Arthur.</p>
<p>Excalibur is about Arthur becoming king of the Britains</p>
<p>and his love of his country and his love of Guinevere.</p>
<p>But eventually, yeah, it becomes more of about</p>
<p>the necessity for the king to love,</p>
<p>to hold Excalibur, to stay, to realize that while,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re the king, you can love your wife</p>
<p>and you can love your best friend,</p>
<p>and they may fuck each other behind your back</p>
<p>and as they fall in love too.</p>
<p>But at the end of the day, your responsibility,</p>
<p>your love has to be to the country and everyone else first</p>
<p>and not your own personal wants,</p>
<p>which, you know, made a much more interesting story</p>
<p>when you have Carmen Berenna and oh, oh, what is that one?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a German opera, but you know, and horses and slow mo</p>
<p>and sword fights and an epic death scene</p>
<p>between Arthur and his son.</p>
<p>Okay, now I definitely have to watch it</p>
<p>and Evan watched it and embarrassed me.</p>
<p>It is John Boorman&rsquo;s second film in Hollywood,</p>
<p>his first one being Point Blank with Lee Marvin,</p>
<p>which is also on top, one of the upper echelon movies</p>
<p>on my list, derived from a book called The Outfit by,</p>
<p>what is his name?</p>
<p>I forget, but Darwin Cook, the comic illustrator,</p>
<p>Donald Westlake wrote, so Darwin Cook does an amazing</p>
<p>comic book send up of Darwin Cook&rsquo;s novels</p>
<p>and they are fucking incredible.</p>
<p>So anyways, but the Point Blank with Lee Marvin,</p>
<p>you know, it&rsquo;s a man driven by purpose, revenge,</p>
<p>but also by like really pure motivations.</p>
<p>He wants his money, he was betrayed and he wants his cash</p>
<p>because this is what he agreed to do the thing for</p>
<p>and this is, which also is part of the reason</p>
<p>why I like No Country for Old Men so much,</p>
<p>which I felt was a great movie, even better book,</p>
<p>but I remember talking to my friend and I go,</p>
<p>you know, Anton Chigurh is the most pure human being</p>
<p>in that whole book.</p>
<p>Well, that guy&rsquo;s the villain.</p>
<p>I go, ha ha, is he evil?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the one, he lies to no one.</p>
<p>He does everything he says he will do.</p>
<p>He always follows his word and on the rare occasion,</p>
<p>he allows fate to make a decision as he figures like,</p>
<p>well, whatever all led us to here will lead us</p>
<p>one way or the other and if we&rsquo;re at this crossroads,</p>
<p>what, how is there any better or worse way</p>
<p>than to do it over a coin flip?</p>
<p>And so that whole scene where the guy&rsquo;s going,</p>
<p>well, what am I putting up?</p>
<p>And he goes, everything, you&rsquo;ve been putting it up</p>
<p>every day of your life and that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>Everything we do is a decision, is a calling, is a choice.</p>
<p>And then it bummed me out that they reduced</p>
<p>the last interaction between Chigurh</p>
<p>and What&rsquo;s His Face&rsquo;s wife and he finally finds her</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s like, you don&rsquo;t have to do this.</p>
<p>I mean, he&rsquo;s like, yes, yes, I do.</p>
<p>This is the way it is.</p>
<p>You can think that your life could&rsquo;ve turned out</p>
<p>any sort of way, you could&rsquo;ve done this,</p>
<p>you could&rsquo;ve done that, but the reality is</p>
<p>this is the way your life is</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s the way it was always going to be.</p>
<p>You know, the fact that I&rsquo;m here is the end of it</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s that.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s funny, if you&rsquo;re honest, this with dark movies</p>
<p>reveal that the villains are the purest of humans</p>
<p>and can teach us the most profound lessons</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s certainly an example of it.</p>
<p>What do you think the big ridiculous</p>
<p>last philosophical question, what do you think</p>
<p>is the meaning of this whole thing we&rsquo;ve got going on</p>
<p>of life and existence on Earth from your individual</p>
<p>perspective but the entirety of the human species?</p>
<p>Life, the universe and everything?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>We could just leave it at that.</p>
<p>You knew exactly where I was going.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>Josh, I love you very much.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve been a huge inspiration.</p>
<p>I have a friend who she said,</p>
<p>do you know Lex Friedman?</p>
<p>Have you gone on Lex&rsquo;s content?</p>
<p>And I go, yes, I know Lex Friedman is.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve sadly been way too long in contact</p>
<p>without making it happen for too long</p>
<p>and yes, I will 100%, I even cut a shirt</p>
<p>at the beginning of the pandemic</p>
<p>to make my own little mask at one point</p>
<p>due to the Lex process and hello, I was like,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t really hear you but I&rsquo;m demonstrating.</p>
<p>Just let&rsquo;s see it through but this has been a blast.</p>
<p>And next time, next time let&rsquo;s drink</p>
<p>some of the Warbringer whiskey.</p>
<p>I will bring some Warmaster.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t sure if you were, if you imbibed at all in spirits.</p>
<p>100%, it felt a little weird to do it early on</p>
<p>in the morning, especially because I&rsquo;m flying out there.</p>
<p>Does it though?</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;ve had some wonderful morning whiskey at times.</p>
<p>It, now that you&rsquo;ve mentioned it, it doesn&rsquo;t at all.</p>
<p>So next time let&rsquo;s make sure what Joe Organ calls</p>
<p>the adult beverages, let&rsquo;s make sure we indulge.</p>
<p>I have zero reservations for doing such a thing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m into it.</p>
<p>Josh, thanks for talking to me.</p>
