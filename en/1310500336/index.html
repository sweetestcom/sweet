    <p>The following is a conversation with Ye,</p>
<p>the legendary artist, producer, and designer</p>
<p>formerly known as Kanye West.</p>
<p>And now, a quick few second mention of each sponsor.</p>
<p>Check them out in the description.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the best way to support this podcast.</p>
<p>We got Shopify for e-commerce,</p>
<p>Insight Tracker for bio-monitoring,</p>
<p>ExpressVPN for privacy,</p>
<p>and Athletic Greens for nutrition.</p>
<p>Choose wisely, my friends.</p>
<p>And now, onto the full ad reads.</p>
<p>As always, no ads in the middle.</p>
<p>I hate those.</p>
<p>They interrupt the conversation,</p>
<p>and I hate it when long-form conversation&rsquo;s interrupted.</p>
<p>Still, if you happen to want to listen to these,</p>
<p>I try to make them interesting,</p>
<p>but go ahead and skip them if you must.</p>
<p>But still, check out the sponsors in the description.</p>
<p>I enjoy their stuff.</p>
<p>Maybe you will, too.</p>
<p>This show is brought to you by Shopify,</p>
<p>a platform designed for anyone to sell anywhere,</p>
<p>with a great-looking online store</p>
<p>that brings your ideas to life</p>
<p>and tools to manage day-to-day operation.</p>
<p>So, since this conversation is with Ye,</p>
<p>the artist formerly known as Kanye West,</p>
<p>I should mention that I got a chance</p>
<p>to hang out with him all day and discuss many things.</p>
<p>But one of the things we talked about is design,</p>
<p>fashion design.</p>
<p>I got a chance to try out some of the things</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s working on, sort of early ideas, middle ideas,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s cool to just explore the way he thinks</p>
<p>about design, how detail-oriented he is,</p>
<p>how he can spend minutes, if not hours,</p>
<p>on a very specific detail.</p>
<p>And even with people like me,</p>
<p>who are not deeply knowledgeable about fashion,</p>
<p>at least like the behind-the-scenes of fashion,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s still able to make it clear to me</p>
<p>and have a brainstorm with me</p>
<p>and just talk.</p>
<p>I mean, the creative fire is there.</p>
<p>No matter what he&rsquo;s going on through his personal life,</p>
<p>the creative fire is burning bright,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s really beautiful to see.</p>
<p>Anyway, if the creative fire burns for you</p>
<p>and you create something and you wanna sell it,</p>
<p>use Shopify.</p>
<p>Get a free trial and full access to Shopify&rsquo;s</p>
<p>entire suite of features when you sign up at Shopify.Lex.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all lowercase.</p>
<p>This show is also brought to you by</p>
<p>our longtime friends, Insight Tracker,</p>
<p>a service I use to track biological data.</p>
<p>Basically, using signals that come from your body</p>
<p>and then take those signals</p>
<p>and use machine learning algorithms</p>
<p>to give you advice on diet and lifestyle changes.</p>
<p>The amount of data that comes from your body</p>
<p>is fascinating.</p>
<p>And the fact that we&rsquo;re not capturing that data,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t have devices or systems</p>
<p>that, while respecting the privacy,</p>
<p>are able to collect that data to give you,</p>
<p>just you, not somebody else, just you,</p>
<p>advice on all kinds of things,</p>
<p>on what to read next, what to eat,</p>
<p>to maximize your well-being, your productivity,</p>
<p>your everything, long-term happiness and growth</p>
<p>and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just obvious to me that that&rsquo;s where the world</p>
<p>is moving and should be moving.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of different trajectories</p>
<p>that you can hurt people through doing that</p>
<p>by being not transparent, being opaque</p>
<p>about how the data is used, who it&rsquo;s sold to,</p>
<p>all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>But as long as you respect the privacy</p>
<p>and the value, the power of that data,</p>
<p>I think you could do some magical things</p>
<p>that help a lot of people,</p>
<p>especially in health and medicine.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s obvious.</p>
<p>Insight Tracker is one of the great companies</p>
<p>that represents that.</p>
<p>Get special savings for a limited time</p>
<p>when you go to insighttracker.com slash Lex.</p>
<p>This show is also brought to you by ExpressVPN.</p>
<p>I use them to protect my privacy on the internet.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m actually talking to the creator of Tor</p>
<p>on the podcast soon, which is a fascinating technology.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so many interesting technologies</p>
<p>that explore the way which you achieve privacy</p>
<p>and the levels of privacy you&rsquo;re comfortable with.</p>
<p>I think the first line of defense</p>
<p>that everybody should be using when privacy is needed,</p>
<p>especially, is a VPN.</p>
<p>And ExpressVPN has been the one I&rsquo;ve used</p>
<p>for many, many years.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the one I love the most.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s the best.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, most importantly, it&rsquo;s super fast,</p>
<p>works on any device,</p>
<p>including whatever operating system you use.</p>
<p>Linux, yes.</p>
<p>Yes, the greatest operating system, Linux, it works on.</p>
<p>It works on beautifully with a big button,</p>
<p>big sexy button that you press, and it all just works.</p>
<p>Super easy, super fun.</p>
<p>Life is simple.</p>
<p>The best security is easy security,</p>
<p>like making sure you do the low-hanging fruit stuff.</p>
<p>Also, make sure you&rsquo;re using Password Manager</p>
<p>or don&rsquo;t use the same password everywhere, whatever you do.</p>
<p>Just stop using password one, two, three, four, five, six.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t make it more secure</p>
<p>if you keep adding numbers after the password.</p>
<p>Or it does a little bit, but not much.</p>

<p>The Legend, the greatest sponsor of all time.</p>
<p>This show is brought to you by Athletic Greens,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s AG1 Drink.</p>
<p>I actually noticed that they sponsor a lot of podcasts,</p>
<p>which in some weird way makes me feel like,</p>
<p>it makes me feel both joyful</p>
<p>that a lot of people are spreading the word,</p>
<p>but also it makes me feel like it&rsquo;s less of a secret</p>
<p>that somehow I discovered.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s like when you were a fan of Green Day</p>
<p>before they were cool.</p>
<p>Oh man, you&rsquo;re like Pearl Jam or whatever,</p>
<p>whatever the band,</p>
<p>when they were not as popular as they are today,</p>
<p>that you loved them.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how I feel about Athletic Greens.</p>
<p>But probably I wasn&rsquo;t even the first wave of people</p>
<p>that discovered and enjoyed Athletic Greens.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m probably like the fifth wave, the 10th wave,</p>
<p>and now it&rsquo;s like the 15th wave.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m incorrectly, from a historical perspective,</p>
<p>making myself feel like I&rsquo;m the OG of Athletic Greens,</p>
<p>the OG of AG, but probably not.</p>
<p>Anyway, I love them and it doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t matter where I am in the waves.</p>
<p>I hope you love them too.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a great way to support your nutritional health.</p>

<p>And now, dear friends, here&rsquo;s Ye.</p>
<p>‚ô™‚ô™‚ô™</p>
<p>Based off of our connection and just you being a friend,</p>
<p>I need to show you my two tech companies</p>
<p>and get your perspective on it.</p>
<p>Because now I have friends that can give a perspective.</p>
<p>Like when I would work on albums,</p>
<p>I had other friends that worked on albums</p>
<p>and they would give me their perspectives on it.</p>
<p>You want to do this?</p>
<p>We are doing it.</p>
<p>This is part of it.</p>
<p>This is part of it?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>All right, beautiful.</p>
<p>Oh, well, I wanted to finish.</p>
<p>The thing is, okay,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to ask me different questions,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m about growing and building</p>
<p>and bringing the idea to life.</p>
<p>So when I see you, I say,</p>
<p>oh, this guy understands how to hire engineers.</p>
<p>Where I&rsquo;m coming from,</p>
<p>coming from Hollywood, coming from press,</p>
<p>coming from media,</p>
<p>all of the guys that,</p>
<p>so many of the guys that have been like voices</p>
<p>and faces and talking heads, whatever,</p>
<p>have not understood how to engineer product.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the reason why I was able to jump past</p>
<p>everyone in the entertainment field and become,</p>
<p>you know, whatever the net worth is, 11 billion.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to stop putting the whole black thing on my worth.</p>
<p>Like, let&rsquo;s just see where I am on the scale of life,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s a cop-out for me to say,</p>
<p>Rich is a black guy of all time,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s feeding into the same, you know,</p>
<p>trauma economy that Black Lives Matter feeds into.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I love and respect engineers.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the only thing that we really need to teach</p>
<p>in school is engineering.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t need to teach history.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t need to teach anything that is subjective.</p>
<p>It needs to only be engineering taught in school,</p>
<p>and everything else needs to be recess.</p>
<p>Nothing at all, any forced subjective information</p>
<p>is just to weaken and indoctrinate our species,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what schools do now.</p>
<p>As an engineer, I love hearing you say that,</p>
<p>but to push back, history is not,</p>
<p>the interpretation of history might be subjective,</p>
<p>but history has some facts,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re useful to give a grounding</p>
<p>to the way you do engineering.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t 100% believe in anything,</p>
<p>any concept of the future or any concept of history,</p>
<p>because history was just written by the victors.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>So if I see stuff happen on the day</p>
<p>that later that day is reported wrong,</p>
<p>so how wrong is something reported 1,000 years ago,</p>
<p>and why would we argue about something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not in the now?</p>
<p>Because that&rsquo;s the only thing that everyone can agree upon,</p>
<p>is that it is now, right now.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, you try not to make the mistakes of the past.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the usefulness of history,</p>
<p>the limited usefulness of history.</p>
<p>The biggest mistake from the past that we keep making</p>
<p>is looking at the past.</p>
<p>Too much, giving too much value to the past.</p>
<p>Too much value to the past, we are now.</p>
<p>We are now, we are here, we are one species,</p>
<p>we are one race, we&rsquo;re here,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s time, and the leadership is changing,</p>
<p>because you have Elon as a leader,</p>
<p>Ye as a leader, and we are the top leaders.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re more influential than the presidents.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re a human being</p>
<p>with engineering challenges before you,</p>
<p>with a stem player, with parlor.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the hardest thing in front of you</p>
<p>on the engineering front?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the first sentence that any of our species</p>
<p>needs to hear when they&rsquo;re born.</p>
<p>You are a human being with engineering challenges,</p>
<p>and I consider challenges to be opportunities</p>
<p>in front of you.</p>
<p>Literally, like, let me see a piece of paper.</p>
<p>I need to write that down.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the beginning of our new species constitution.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna do the paper like this wide,</p>
<p>put it in widescreen, this for Ridley.</p>
<p>You are, no, let me like,</p>
<p>you are a being with engineering.</p>
<p>Opportunities or challenges?</p>
<p>Opportunities, I&rsquo;m sorry,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t spell as good as John Legend.</p>
<p>Opportunities in before you.</p>
<p>I like the before,</p>
<p>cause it can mean, actually it can mean forward</p>
<p>or before you.</p>
<p>This right here, I&rsquo;ve always said I&rsquo;m the top five writer</p>
<p>in human existence,</p>
<p>but this is like, this right here is pushing me</p>
<p>to like number four or number three.</p>
<p>Because who would you say is the top?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s top writer in human existence, we know who it is.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s subjective.</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s that?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s factual, though.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, okay, who&rsquo;s the top person in tech history?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not subjective.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a non-subjective answer to both of those.</p>
<p>Both of those people have influenced 30% of our existence.</p>
<p>So the influence is the main metric of greatness.</p>
<p>Okay, one person, 30% of our language was,</p>
<p>the English language was written by them.</p>
<p>The other person, 30% of the products we use</p>
<p>was led by them.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s obvious.</p>
<p>30% of our language was written by Shakespeare.</p>
<p>And then the product, product, product, product.</p>
<p>Look, look.</p>
<p>Steve Jobs.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You put Steve above like Elon&rsquo;s of the world?</p>
<p>Cause Steve is a designer, not,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a designer and engineer, but he&rsquo;s a design,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a visionary in the design space.</p>
<p>Well, I would lean to him because I&rsquo;m not an engineer.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m more like.</p>
<p>Then you&rsquo;re an engineer.</p>
<p>If Steve is an engineer, you&rsquo;re an engineer, essentially.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a cultural engineer.</p>
<p>Like the people who run the emotions of the world</p>
<p>and run the world off of people&rsquo;s emotions right now</p>
<p>are social engineers.</p>
<p>And social engineering is so important,</p>
<p>like city design.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a fancier word for that.</p>
<p>But I was in Oxnard last night to see Anthony Jeselnik.</p>
<p>And I got to find out what his opening joke was</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m doing interviews and I&rsquo;m thinking I&rsquo;m funny.</p>
<p>And I like that he said,</p>
<p>he just kept on saying 20 year anniversary.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been doing this for 20 years.</p>
<p>And his opening joke was so high level.</p>
<p>I realized that I wasn&rsquo;t funny.</p>
<p>I realized that this dude is a professional at what he does.</p>
<p>And so many things are subjective.</p>
<p>I always talk about this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, you know, people are arguing like,</p>
<p>is Emily Ratajkowski the hottest, you know, person?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, that&rsquo;s such a subjective thing.</p>
<p>But like, if you go and shoot three pointers</p>
<p>with Steph Curry, it&rsquo;s not subjective, right?</p>
<p>Or if you go and compare bank accounts with Elon,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not subjective.</p>
<p>And another thing that&rsquo;s not subjective, porn.</p>
<p>What about it?</p>
<p>Dick size, it&rsquo;s not subjective.</p>
<p>You can measure.</p>
<p>But porn is more about, more than just dick size</p>
<p>and greatness is more than the size</p>
<p>of the bank account, right?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a subjective.</p>
<p>But greatness is subjective though.</p>
<p>Right, so do you care about the stuff</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s objective or subjective more?</p>
<p>Because greatness to me is what matters.</p>
<p>The bank account comes and goes.</p>
<p>The impact on our society, like you said,</p>
<p>the impact on social engineering,</p>
<p>the impact on the collective intelligence of our species,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what permeates throughout the rest of time.</p>
<p>I like what you said, the impact.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m taking notes.</p>
<p>How did you, what&rsquo;d you say?</p>
<p>The impact on the collective intelligence of our species.</p>
<p>Impact on the collective intelligence.</p>
<p>And when Ye is writing down the words</p>
<p>that came out of my dumb mouth, I have made it in life.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of people that have kind of like</p>
<p>sat through, I wanted to wear a different color hoodie</p>
<p>because I was just tired of seeing this hoodie</p>
<p>in all the interviews.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a lot of kids that are with me,</p>
<p>they see what I&rsquo;m saying.</p>
<p>And they had to sit through all of the muck</p>
<p>of all the previous interviews to get to this.</p>
<p>Every interview has been just an emotional,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just like been an argument up to this point.</p>
<p>This is the first of, this is the next frontier</p>
<p>of where our species is gonna head.</p>
<p>It starts here, it starts with you, Lex.</p>
<p>So this is the first time I heard you say the word</p>
<p>engineering at least so many times, which I love hearing.</p>
<p>So this is where you&rsquo;re at.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like that newborn.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a being with engineering opportunities.</p>
<p>Yeah, and we&rsquo;re all a newborn,</p>
<p>because in Christianity we say born again.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re all newborns.</p>
<p>And everyone can, everyone shall, I don&rsquo;t like the word can.</p>
<p>Shall, the only thing about shall is it kind of dictates</p>
<p>and can kind of lets people off the hook.</p>
<p>So I haven&rsquo;t found the perfect post Shakespeare</p>
<p>and post Steve Jobs and post Elon and post Ye</p>
<p>and post Drake way to communicate this.</p>
<p>But we update and we do.</p>
<p>And what the current media structure,</p>
<p>no, it&rsquo;s not actually nothing that&rsquo;s holding us.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing actually holding us back</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m still alive.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still alive.</p>
<p>Like they could have killed me at,</p>
<p>George Bush don&rsquo;t care about black people.</p>
<p>They could have killed me at Beyonce had the best video,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re here now.</p>
<p>So we just keep on leaning and leaning and leaning.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s these things where I just think about,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;ll be times when I&rsquo;m at war</p>
<p>and every now and then when the bomb stopped going off</p>
<p>and all the headlines and the smearing</p>
<p>and all that stopped going off,</p>
<p>I think about my family and I&rsquo;ll think about Kim</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll think about how King Koopa</p>
<p>has her in the castle right now.</p>
<p>And just on Mario Brothers, you know how it is.</p>
<p>Just go for the princess and you get to this level</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like, I sung the song wrong, right?</p>
<p>And then they take the princess again.</p>
<p>Which one are you, Mario?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your favorite thing?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the thing you love the most about Kim</p>
<p>from a Mario perspective and the princess?</p>
<p>Looking back, was there a moment?</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s definitely my favorite of all time.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Was there a moment that, you know,</p>
<p>like that catches you off guard and you say,</p>
<p>I love this human being?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, it&rsquo;s just the DNA is like,</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s a mix of Rob and Chris.</p>
<p>Can you explain?</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s like a really high pool right there.</p>
<p>Those are like two geniuses.</p>
<p>So, okay.</p>
<p>So like the entire history of evolution</p>
<p>of the human species created this DNA.</p>
<p>They created this being.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a life there.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a set of memories in the history</p>
<p>that brought you together.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;re like, damn, I like this DNA.</p>
<p>Yeah, certain people have just like high DNA.</p>
<p>Ivanka Trump has high DNA.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s like-</p>
<p>How&rsquo;s your DNA?</p>
<p>Pretty good?</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;ve seen that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been proven.</p>
<p>I mean, but look at my mom and look at my dad.</p>
<p>You know, me and my dad have a water purification center</p>
<p>in the DR right now.</p>
<p>And my dad is the original Steve Jobs</p>
<p>and he was blocked by people around him</p>
<p>and people were using him and taking advantage</p>
<p>and, you know, not believing in his vision.</p>
<p>My dad&rsquo;s the educated version of Ye.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;d you learn about life from your dad?</p>
<p>My dad got girls too.</p>
<p>But those are small details.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a big detail being that I found my dad&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>you know, Playboy when I was five years old.</p>
<p>It greatly affected my motivation.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>All right, so that&rsquo;s part of the engine that drives Ye.</p>
<p>Absolutely, I remember when Pharrell</p>
<p>was first in all the videos</p>
<p>and my girl was like, girls like Pharrell.</p>
<p>And I was like, I want girls to like me too.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so funny that that&rsquo;s behind all the ambition,</p>
<p>all the drive.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s how we make people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s how people are made.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the desire to be loved.</p>
<p>Is that at the individual level just being noticed</p>
<p>and also at the societal level of scale?</p>
<p>Well, now I&rsquo;ve gone past,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like at that place where Nikolai Tesla</p>
<p>was later into his career</p>
<p>where it wasn&rsquo;t about being loved.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t about sitting at the dinner parties</p>
<p>next to Anna Wintour and stuff.</p>
<p>It was about getting the idea across.</p>
<p>So I have these cells that are very,</p>
<p>and I just keep on saying Ridley Scott,</p>
<p>but Ridley Scott has a special anointing.</p>
<p>It isn&rsquo;t just sci-fi what he&rsquo;s doing.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something in there, just like George Lucas.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something different that&rsquo;s there.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>What are you drawing?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m drawing these new living cells that we will exist in.</p>
<p>And this is over, okay, let&rsquo;s do like,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like talking about money</p>
<p>because like man made money up anyway.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like four quadrillion respected dollars.</p>
<p>And then you have other forms of currency.</p>
<p>Of course, social currency is super important right now.</p>
<p>But this is a drawing and it&rsquo;s at a pretty good place now.</p>
<p>This will be 40,000 square feet.</p>
<p>I wanna start just talking in meters.</p>
<p>I just think we should go to anything</p>
<p>to restore the Tower of Basel.</p>
<p>Like they said when the,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just drawing a person here for scale.</p>
<p>Yeah, that would help.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>What do you think of that?</p>
<p>Look at my person, see the scale in this room?</p>
<p>All right, so.</p>
<p>Wait, the dot is the person?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m saying it&rsquo;s 40,000 square feet.</p>
<p>But that would be like.</p>
<p>What are the other parts of the cell?</p>
<p>Okay, so it&rsquo;s a screen.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t go all the way to the top</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s one hole for light.</p>
<p>But the water and the light and air all come in from the top.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s like the mouth.</p>
<p>And then this is the belly button.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re God&rsquo;s iPhone, we&rsquo;re his greatest creation.</p>
<p>So this is all connected?</p>
<p>These are all connected?</p>
<p>Yeah, so I&rsquo;m drawing how these other cells</p>
<p>go next to each other.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the vision here?</p>
<p>Happiness.</p>
<p>Then we talk about like what&rsquo;s the motivation?</p>
<p>Like yeah, there&rsquo;s a motivation somewhere</p>
<p>in the back of my mind of my family.</p>
<p>And if it&rsquo;s like where Moses smithed the rock</p>
<p>and God didn&rsquo;t allow him to get to the promised land.</p>
<p>Because the promised land is family.</p>
<p>That is the promised, that is earth.</p>
<p>I mean, that is heaven on earth is family.</p>
<p>Family is heaven, that&rsquo;s the promised land.</p>
<p>And for your family to be together.</p>
<p>So say I smithed the rock and God doesn&rsquo;t let me</p>
<p>have my family back.</p>
<p>My mission in life is still to promote families</p>
<p>at all costs and make family&rsquo;s existence easier.</p>
<p>So you take this thing, you put a localized farm,</p>
<p>say if it&rsquo;s in a community, that we do localized growing</p>
<p>and then we partner with big farmer and say,</p>
<p>hey, you&rsquo;re actually gonna make more money</p>
<p>by making better food.</p>
<p>Because at the end of the day,</p>
<p>you want money right now.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like everyone knows that between the pesticides</p>
<p>and between the medical industry,</p>
<p>and especially America, that we&rsquo;re keeping people sick.</p>
<p>And we know that McDonald&rsquo;s makes food that kills people</p>
<p>and Coca-Cola is selling sugar water and all this like,</p>
<p>just in case I haven&rsquo;t pissed off enough people in power.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay, so.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna piss off the sugar,</p>
<p>anybody that&rsquo;s powered on sugar.</p>
<p>Sugar, well sugar, what&rsquo;s the health</p>
<p>was actually a documentary on sugar.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t about how bad meat was.</p>
<p>It was like a reverse documentary on sugar.</p>
<p>A reverse, I don&rsquo;t know if you call it a reverse,</p>
<p>like a sub, but if you watch it again,</p>
<p>when they show sugar and it&rsquo;s just,</p>
<p>the sugar looks super clean.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So as I state these things,</p>
<p>I know that, I know I have protection.</p>
<p>If I have God&rsquo;s protection,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m here to this date, right?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s for me to have this platform</p>
<p>and express exactly what I feel</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s kids out there, right?</p>
<p>That it&rsquo;s kids that are gonna save the world</p>
<p>through engineering and through facts.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve got to get download as much of the information</p>
<p>and as much of the, don&rsquo;t be afraid to state your facts</p>
<p>is the biggest thing because the world</p>
<p>is being ran by fear.</p>
<p>And that is, no, actually God runs the world,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s just like little cloud,</p>
<p>this patina of our ego that deals with the money</p>
<p>and the car and the girl we&rsquo;re dating</p>
<p>and all this in the clothes you wear</p>
<p>and spending too much on clothes.</p>
<p>And a lot of stuff that I&rsquo;ve been involved with promoting.</p>
<p>So now what I&rsquo;m promoting is you have the idea,</p>
<p>you say it out loud, like if you had Tourette&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>say your truth out loud.</p>
<p>If you hate, yay, you hate me, say that out loud.</p>
<p>Say whatever you feel out loud.</p>
<p>Like you say it non-violently, non-violent.</p>
<p>Non-violent, I have to say that as a shout out</p>
<p>to Alex Jones and Trump, where they try to say</p>
<p>that when they say their truths out loud</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s inciting violence.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s be like really clear.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m saying that they have criminalized free thought.</p>
<p>I hate when people use they,</p>
<p>like they gets the blame for everything, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always they.</p>
<p>Oh, who the fuck is they?</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>The problem is they is us.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, I love that.</p>
<p>What we needed to do is turn I to we.</p>
<p>So we take the responsibility and turn they to us.</p>
<p>So we take accountability to us.</p>
<p>They, I to we and they to us.</p>
<p>And that relates, it&rsquo;s a language at the same time.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re seeing the language of our surroundings.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re seeing the language of,</p>
<p>I mean, one of the things,</p>
<p>okay, let&rsquo;s go back to the cell explanation</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m also doing, what&rsquo;s that thing</p>
<p>when Elon just put all the information open</p>
<p>and people could figure out,</p>
<p>they could figure it out and open source.</p>
<p>Yeah, open source.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m open sourcing this idea right now</p>
<p>so that, you know, engineers and anointed people,</p>
<p>beings, anointed beings can collectively contribute to this</p>
<p>to push our species forward.</p>
<p>So where I&rsquo;ve got to with my research</p>
<p>is that there will be a hole at the top</p>
<p>that allows natural light, natural air,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a constant water system.</p>
<p>So it becomes like a water city</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s a constant flow that&rsquo;s not,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s regenerative, it&rsquo;s not wasting the water,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just a constant flow.</p>
<p>So I put the toilet really close to where this,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to call it a wave pool,</p>
<p>but in the pool, the water&rsquo;s not still.</p>
<p>So that exists in water, surrounded by water.</p>
<p>Well, the living room, you have two rooms.</p>
<p>You have the dry room,</p>
<p>which people have called a living room before,</p>
<p>and then you have the wet room.</p>
<p>How is that a source of happiness?</p>
<p>What is broken about our world today</p>
<p>that that gives you in terms of the pursuit of happiness,</p>
<p>which is one of the things in the previous declaration?</p>
<p>All of our buildings are based on just</p>
<p>the industry and the economy.</p>
<p>And then people lean into what people are used to seeing,</p>
<p>like what we think is attractive,</p>
<p>because then you go back to the women who give life.</p>
<p>So everyone wants to be attractive to the attractive.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the reason why the media goes and gets</p>
<p>Bella Hadid, Kim Kardashian, Emily Ratajkowski,</p>
<p>those are the only ones I&rsquo;m going to&hellip;</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s more?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s more, but I&rsquo;m thinking of ones</p>
<p>that I think are attractive.</p>
<p>It is subjective.</p>
<p>Yeah, because it&rsquo;s subjective.</p>
<p>So to my subjective, which I think the only guys</p>
<p>that could argue with me on my opinion on girls</p>
<p>would be Brad and Leo,</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re the only ones with the track record,</p>
<p>everything else.</p>
<p>So for everybody else, it&rsquo;s subjective.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got history, so.</p>
<p>Are you happy?</p>
<p>Absolutely, I&rsquo;m just here.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s difficult to make me unhappy.</p>
<p>Now I could deal with frustrations,</p>
<p>but when those frustrations are, it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;ve allowed people to be in your life</p>
<p>that shouldn&rsquo;t be there,</p>
<p>and then they do the thing you knew they were gonna do,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re screaming at them,</p>
<p>but you really need to scream at yourself.</p>
<p>Yeah, so you realize anything that&rsquo;s anger or frustration,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s wrong with you</p>
<p>that needs to be dealt with.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Like right now, okay, say I got this pattern cutter</p>
<p>that I wanted to remove,</p>
<p>because I felt like she was copying our patterns</p>
<p>into the computer,</p>
<p>and I didn&rsquo;t know why she wanted to do that,</p>
<p>and I just wanted to do the patterns by hand.</p>
<p>And then, you know.</p>
<p>You mean like automating the patterns?</p>
<p>Is that what you mean?</p>
<p>Yeah, and my head of it,</p>
<p>because they just, that&rsquo;s the whole thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s a war of human beings and robots.</p>
<p>Yeah, but that makes it more efficient, right?</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t like the efficiency.</p>
<p>You like the creativity of the singular nature</p>
<p>of the pattern.</p>
<p>I believe that the human beings,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m saying this to you as a person who makes robots</p>
<p>and a person who&rsquo;s friends with Elon.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m deeply offended right now.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ll let it go.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So, yeah, I believe that the.</p>
<p>Yeah, he hates robots.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not gonna put that out there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a joke.</p>
<p>Robots have feelings too.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>That was also a joke.</p>
<p>We need to clarify that for future robots.</p>
<p>But the pattern cutter,</p>
<p>the pattern cutter, you don&rsquo;t like that.</p>
<p>That had to be, you can&rsquo;t have that part of your life.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not what I&rsquo;m.</p>
<p>My, everything that I&rsquo;m doing is for</p>
<p>the sake of the human race.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s things in capitalism.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s things in technology.</p>
<p>Well, technology and original human species,</p>
<p>can exist in a peaceful way.</p>
<p>As long as the people that know how to make robots</p>
<p>aren&rsquo;t using their robots to control the humans.</p>
<p>Lex?</p>
<p>Definitely something you have to be concerned about</p>
<p>as we become more technologically savvy.</p>
<p>That, my friend, is why engineering isn&rsquo;t everything.</p>
<p>That you have to desperately study the lessons of history.</p>
<p>In Nazi Germany, science was used to create atrocities.</p>
<p>Engineering, the same.</p>
<p>Engineering could be a tool of war.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re still in the Holocaust.</p>
<p>A Jewish friend of mine said,</p>
<p>oh, come, go visit the Holocaust Museum.</p>
<p>And my response was,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s visit our Holocaust Museum, Planned Parenthood.</p>
<p>With all due respect, I grew up in the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Jewish.</p>
<p>Parts of my family perished in the Holocaust of Nazi Germany.</p>
<p>I have to push back that there is a difference</p>
<p>of the atrocities at that scale, at that time,</p>
<p>on an entire people.</p>
<p>I was gonna say the number, that&rsquo;s the difference.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the number.</p>
<p>Because six million, well, also,</p>
<p>African-Americans are actually Jew also.</p>
<p>The lost tribe of Israel.</p>
<p>I can push back on that, too.</p>
<p>Okay, so, well, everyone came from Africa.</p>
<p>I am African.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m basically African-American.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re brothers.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re both Jew, and we&rsquo;re brothers, so.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re human.</p>
<p>Six million people died in the Holocaust.</p>
<p>Over 20 million have died by the hands of abortion.</p>
<p>And the media promotes the my body, my choice,</p>
<p>which is actually still a promotion for Planned Parenthood.</p>
<p>50% of black deaths a year is actually abortion.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the cop with the knee.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not black-on-black violence and gang violence.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not heart attacks.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually abortion.</p>
<p>The most dangerous place for a black person in America</p>
<p>is in their mother&rsquo;s stomach.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s 900 to a million abortions</p>
<p>in the United States a year.</p>
<p>I hear you.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s something about the rape, the torture,</p>
<p>the murder of children, women, men,</p>
<p>the complete humiliation, and just the suffering</p>
<p>that was endured during World War II.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what we deal with on our TVs</p>
<p>right now with black people.</p>
<p>Soros would use black trauma economy to win an election.</p>
<p>What I love is having a healthy conversation</p>
<p>as opposed to, there&rsquo;s certain things,</p>
<p>you know, boom, this drops.</p>
<p>People are gonna have pussy hats on.</p>
<p>Boom, this drops.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna be black people and white people with signs.</p>
<p>Boom, this drops.</p>
<p>So hey, China, hey, left agenda, hey,</p>
<p>what we&rsquo;re gonna do is say that our species</p>
<p>can have a healthy conversation.</p>
<p>Can I just linger on this?</p>
<p>Because when you say Jewish media,</p>
<p>it, there&rsquo;s a echo of a pain that people feel</p>
<p>that reminds an entire.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re saying it&rsquo;s redundant, right?</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m not saying it&rsquo;s redundant.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m saying. I&rsquo;m saying it&rsquo;s redundant.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re saying it&rsquo;s redundant.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a redundant statement.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m saying it&rsquo;s something that Joseph,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m saying that it&rsquo;s something that Joseph Goebbels,</p>
<p>the propaganda minister of Nazi Germany said.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m saying it&rsquo;s been said so many times</p>
<p>in order to murder and torture Jewish people</p>
<p>that it just rings wrong.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>Just like the N word when spoken by people</p>
<p>that have the same skin color as me.</p>
<p>It reminds people of a very dark time.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>If Jewish people would accept that I&rsquo;m Jew,</p>
<p>then they would see what I&rsquo;m saying in a different way.</p>
<p>They would hear it in a different way.</p>
<p>But see, the people, you saying you&rsquo;re Jewish, that.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m Jew, not Jewish.</p>
<p>Jewish means like that of a Jew.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m saying I&rsquo;m Jew.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re Jew.</p>
<p>The blood of Christ, orthodox Christian.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>But that, are you,</p>
<p>are you a follower of the philosophy</p>
<p>of the black Hebrew Israelites?</p>
<p>Because that&rsquo;s where the idea comes from.</p>
<p>Not all of those folks are extremists,</p>
<p>but some are extremists.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a follower of the idea,</p>
<p>I have a vague idea that all people came from Africa.</p>
<p>But what I wanted to do,</p>
<p>okay, now I could Andy Kaufman this</p>
<p>about seven more minutes and then tell you what it is,</p>
<p>what the whole point is.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s count, seven minutes.</p>
<p>No, I did this to do a spoiler alert.</p>
<p>Sure, spoiler.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the first thing I said at the beginning?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking about engineering and humans.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re all human.</p>
<p>And then what did I say we shouldn&rsquo;t focus on?</p>
<p>Race.</p>
<p>Not just that.</p>
<p>I said they shouldn&rsquo;t teach this in school.</p>
<p>History.</p>
<p>The history, because what they do,</p>
<p>what schools are doing is exactly what the CIA does</p>
<p>with Pixar films and Disney films.</p>
<p>They make Bambi&rsquo;s mom die in the beginning, right?</p>
<p>And off that pain comes a purchase of ice cream.</p>
<p>Off that pain comes, I need some more toys.</p>
<p>Off that pain comes, I need a bigger house.</p>
<p>Off that pain comes, I need more girls than my wife.</p>
<p>Off that pain comes, so they put that pain in to make us,</p>
<p>now we&rsquo;re the orphans of capitalism,</p>
<p>to make us be consumers and we need to be a community,</p>
<p>not just consumers.</p>
<p>So I could have went another seven minutes</p>
<p>by being a person who presents himself in a way that says,</p>
<p>well, I don&rsquo;t have to feel your pain</p>
<p>because I also have pain too that&rsquo;s not being recognized.</p>
<p>And in every interview, when I say,</p>
<p>well, why did I get to the point of putting up the tweet?</p>
<p>No one wants to understand why I got to that point.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>You had pain, you had pain.</p>
<p>Yeah, but no one.</p>
<p>The pain in your heart.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s say this,</p>
<p>undoubtedly Jewish people have a lot of movies</p>
<p>about that pain and black people have a lot of movies</p>
<p>about the pain of slavery, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost impossible to find a movie about Mansa Munsa.</p>
<p>When you go to the African History Museum</p>
<p>in Washington, DC, it doesn&rsquo;t start with the idea</p>
<p>of Africans being kings.</p>
<p>It starts with the idea of Africans being slaves.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s another interesting point about this.</p>
<p>This was said to me one time and it stuck with me</p>
<p>as a family member of mine.</p>
<p>With Africans, how many times you&rsquo;ve heard like a rapper</p>
<p>talk about, we were kings.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s incorrect if we&rsquo;re Jew.</p>
<p>If we&rsquo;re Jew, and since we are, we weren&rsquo;t the kings.</p>
<p>We were the slaves that Moses freed.</p>
<p>Africans have always said, we&rsquo;ve heard,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve listened to rap music and hear black people say,</p>
<p>we kings, we blood of the Pharaohs.</p>
<p>And if we are Jew, then we weren&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>We were the people that Moses freed.</p>
<p>And when we talk about, have you heard black people</p>
<p>talk about 400 years of slavery?</p>
<p>All right, that is, and we&rsquo;re having this history lesson.</p>
<p>That history doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re exploring ancient history</p>
<p>and drawing deep wisdom from it.</p>
<p>And at the same time saying we need to forget all of it.</p>
<p>We need to put that behind us.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>We need to forget it and we need to move forward.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so much wisdom to draw from history.</p>
<p>Even the 20th century.</p>
<p>Look at this, communism.</p>
<p>Without the lessons of history of the 20th century,</p>
<p>communism sounds like a great idea.</p>
<p>Except that some of the worst atrocities</p>
<p>conducted by Stalin and Mao that killed</p>
<p>50, 100 plus million people.</p>
<p>Not just killed, tortured, starvation.</p>
<p>Where people, cannibalism, they ate each other.</p>
<p>They ate their children.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just dark, people should read some books on this,</p>
<p>on the Holodomor in the 1930s.</p>
<p>But I disagree.</p>
<p>With that lesson, we would, and now it&rsquo;s becoming</p>
<p>more popular, Marxism and communism.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not disagreeing that that happened.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m disagreeing that we need to harp</p>
<p>on the things that happened.</p>
<p>Because the truth is, I&rsquo;m giving a fact.</p>
<p>50% today of, let&rsquo;s say you don&rsquo;t call</p>
<p>black people Jew, right?</p>
<p>Black people&rsquo;s deaths today is abortion.</p>
<p>Today, right now.</p>
<p>Like that, it&rsquo;s not racism.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s too wide of a term.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s genocide and population control</p>
<p>that black people are in today in America</p>
<p>that is promoted by the music and the media</p>
<p>that black people make that Jewish record labels</p>
<p>get paid off of, or media companies.</p>
<p>Record labels and media company also,</p>
<p>so let&rsquo;s give it a wider.</p>
<p>You know, I agree with Martin Luther King.</p>
<p>I have a dream too.</p>
<p>Martin Luther King was.</p>
<p>That one day you would not be judged</p>
<p>by the color of your skin or your race,</p>
<p>black or Jew, but by the content of your character.</p>
<p>All the assholes that fucked you over</p>
<p>in the music industry, fuck artists over</p>
<p>in the music industry are individuals.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not Jews.</p>
<p>Can you say.</p>
<p>They are Jewish.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t, they&rsquo;re human with opportunities.</p>
<p>And they took those opportunities.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care if they&rsquo;re Jewish.</p>
<p>Do you feel like I should release that pain and separate it?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Okay, so if that, okay.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re saying I should release that pain</p>
<p>and separate it, then I&rsquo;m telling you,</p>
<p>you should release your pain and separate it</p>
<p>and we could get to this, the list of how you are being</p>
<p>with engineering opportunities.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s 100%.</p>
<p>I see what you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s exactly what you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>The pain, I&rsquo;m gonna let it go.</p>
<p>Engineering challenges, I get it.</p>
<p>One of the problems you highlight</p>
<p>is people get fucked over in the music industry</p>
<p>and get fucked over in the media,</p>
<p>get fucked over all over the place.</p>
<p>They created, there was a Jewish trainer</p>
<p>that brought me to the hospital and put in press</p>
<p>that I went to the hospital.</p>
<p>I know friends that off of exhaustion,</p>
<p>a Jewish doctor that diagnosed me.</p>
<p>Why do you keep saying Jewish?</p>
<p>Because they were, right?</p>
<p>Diagnosed me with bipolar disorder</p>
<p>and shot me with medication and put me on medication,</p>
<p>then put it in the press.</p>
<p>And every time, even if I wore the wrong color hat</p>
<p>that a nigger is not supposed to wear, right?</p>
<p>Then they immediately say he&rsquo;s off of his shit,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s off his meds, he&rsquo;s off his rocker.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s literally used</p>
<p>as a scarlet letter control mechanism for the,</p>
<p>people understand, the kids, the colleges,</p>
<p>the high schools.</p>
<p>What do you think they put me right now?</p>
<p>They put me as the prophet, not the leader.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t have to be the leader, right?</p>
<p>Cause we need a more intelligent person to be the leader,</p>
<p>but at least, right?</p>
<p>They put me as the prophet.</p>
<p>They put me as the only person that would say this.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m just saying that was four Jewish members</p>
<p>that controlled my voice because for the fact</p>
<p>that 90% of black people in entertainment</p>
<p>from sports to music to acting</p>
<p>are in some way tied into Jewish business people.</p>
<p>Meaning that in some way,</p>
<p>just like if Rahm is sitting next to Obama</p>
<p>or Jared&rsquo;s sitting next to Trump,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a Jewish person right there controlling the country,</p>
<p>the Jewish controlling that who gets the best video or not,</p>
<p>controlling what the media says about me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a person, not Jewish.</p>
<p>Let me just say one thing.</p>
<p>But they are though.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the only thing.</p>
<p>It just so happens that they are.</p>
<p>It just happens that they are.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t mean that I hate them.</p>
<p>That just means that they are.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s a dog whistle too.</p>
<p>Let me just say, as I would love to add more love</p>
<p>to the world, I would love you to do that</p>
<p>as a person with a big voice, with a big powerful voice</p>
<p>that a lot of people look up to.</p>
<p>And when you say Jewish media,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s funny how this world works that way.</p>
<p>When you say Jewish media,</p>
<p>or Jews are controlling the voice of black artists,</p>
<p>black people, black artists,</p>
<p>when you say that-</p>
<p>Am I not allowed to say it out loud?</p>
<p>You can say it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a large number of people that are hurting</p>
<p>and have anger and even have hate in their heart</p>
<p>when they hear Jewish media,</p>
<p>they start, that hate starts being directed</p>
<p>towards the Jewish people.</p>
<p>Do you acknowledge that?</p>
<p>Do you understand?</p>
<p>Can you feel the hate in the world</p>
<p>that comes to the surface when you say stuff like that?</p>
<p>Okay, I feel that when we go into therapy,</p>
<p>my dad was a therapist,</p>
<p>and obviously I&rsquo;ve got some therapy skills myself.</p>
<p>A lot of people, my music is healing.</p>
<p>These type of spa-like existences are healing.</p>
<p>The color palettes I use are healing.</p>
<p>And we can use healing words, right?</p>
<p>What I really feel,</p>
<p>I feel that there&rsquo;s no accountability</p>
<p>and no responsibility on Jewish people in media</p>
<p>to at least start with owning up with the facts</p>
<p>of what&rsquo;s dealt with and tell me,</p>
<p>if I say the facts out loud,</p>
<p>to the point of Ari Emanuel writing a letter</p>
<p>in the Financial Times</p>
<p>trying to take food out of my children&rsquo;s mouth,</p>
<p>telling people that they&rsquo;re not allowed to work with me.</p>
<p>Even Chris Cuomo or Piers Morgan</p>
<p>getting me to apologize and separate Jewish business people</p>
<p>from the families of the Jewish business people,</p>
<p>which I did, update, I did that, that already happened.</p>
<p>And the way I-</p>
<p>That was a shitty apology.</p>
<p>That wasn&rsquo;t really an apology,</p>
<p>but shout out for that conversation.</p>
<p>Great conversation.</p>
<p>I need to get on my knees</p>
<p>and kiss the dick of Howard Stern and-</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need to kiss anyone&rsquo;s dick.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s what you guys are acting like.</p>
<p>You guys, look at that.</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;re talking about it as a shitty opinion,</p>
<p>apology, but where&rsquo;s our fucking apology?</p>
<p>Watch this.</p>
<p>Sorry.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t get, thank you.</p>
<p>Now, let&rsquo;s move on.</p>
<p>Sorry.</p>
<p>Oh, do I need to get on my knees or no?</p>
<p>And kiss my dick.</p>
<p>Oh, shit.</p>
<p>So-</p>
<p>This escalated quickly.</p>
<p>So, that&rsquo;s escalated quickly.</p>
<p>So, the-</p>
<p>So, what-</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m saying, where&rsquo;s our apology?</p>
<p>But we can&rsquo;t get to apology because you&rsquo;re telling me</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no right way for me to word it.</p>
<p>So, tell me, for me, a person who&rsquo;s been fucked on my deals</p>
<p>and a person that has friends that never figured out</p>
<p>how to make shoes with a German company</p>
<p>that couldn&rsquo;t tell me to wear a BLM shirt</p>
<p>and take off my red hat,</p>
<p>like what would have happened if I was at Nike, right?</p>
<p>Tell me exactly how to engineer the situation I&rsquo;m in.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you exactly how.</p>
<p>You got a big voice,</p>
<p>have the balls as a man to call out the individuals.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t call them Jews.</p>
<p>Call them by their name</p>
<p>and start a war against those individuals.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not Jewish.</p>
<p>But if that&rsquo;s the case, will you help me with that?</p>
<p>Sure, 100%.</p>
<p>Assholes are-</p>
<p>Well, let me flip that to,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t understand the industry well.</p>
<p>I see that people are fucking people over, for sure,</p>
<p>but how do you solve that?</p>
<p>If you run, if you right now run the world&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing a million things,</p>
<p>but say you ran also a record label.</p>
<p>I have ran a record label.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;ve been ran by a record label</p>
<p>where I was the face of a record label</p>
<p>and had Big Sean and different people complaining to me.</p>
<p>And I knew fuck about running a record label.</p>
<p>I was simply just a talented producer</p>
<p>and an influencer that then started good music,</p>
<p>but I wasn&rsquo;t the one running good music.</p>
<p>How would you do it differently?</p>
<p>This is something I propose.</p>
<p>I would look at the top 10 execs in three fields,</p>
<p>in sports, film, and music.</p>
<p>And I would look at the top 10</p>
<p>clients, participants, talent.</p>
<p>I would look at the top talent in each of those fields,</p>
<p>the top 10 of them.</p>
<p>And some of them are gonna be Tom Brady.</p>
<p>Some of them are gonna be Taylor Swift.</p>
<p>Some of them, they&rsquo;re not all gonna be black, right?</p>
<p>Some of them, so some of them would be Adele, right?</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll look at all their contracts transparently.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll compare the notes and re-engineer</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s a new constitution.</p>
<p>Because when I told my dad when I was 19</p>
<p>that I was gonna get into the music industry,</p>
<p>he begged me not to.</p>
<p>He said, I heard it&rsquo;s treacherous.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m in a position where I&rsquo;ve been through it.</p>
<p>I saw it.</p>
<p>I went out, made some money somewhere else.</p>
<p>I saw my name get smeared.</p>
<p>I saw my family get destroyed.</p>
<p>I saw my reputation get destroyed.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m back here to have this kind of,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m back here as a being with engineering opportunities.</p>
<p>So, and if you say as a shitty apology,</p>
<p>what is the version of the apology</p>
<p>short of kissing Howard Stern&rsquo;s dick?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think anyone wants to kiss Howard Stern&rsquo;s dick.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the whole point, Howard Stern.</p>
<p>Nobody wants to kiss your dick, so shut the fuck up.</p>
<p>I said, and by the way, I&rsquo;m antagonizing you, Howard Stern.</p>
<p>I used to be a fan of you.</p>
<p>Yeah, me too.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still a fan sometimes.</p>
<p>Now you&rsquo;re just doing clickbait like everybody else.</p>
<p>Now you&rsquo;re just a sad old man, Howard.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Now, Howard Stern, this is the first time</p>
<p>anyone&rsquo;s said your name in years.</p>
<p>Your own family doesn&rsquo;t say your name</p>
<p>unless they&rsquo;re calling to get their bills paid.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going hard.</p>
<p>See, that&rsquo;s beautiful right there.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s much better than calling Jewish media.</p>
<p>Go after individuals.</p>
<p>Okay, so.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t talk shit about me, talk shit about me.</p>
<p>This is great.</p>
<p>And you know what that is?</p>
<p>Yeah, what&rsquo;s that?</p>
<p>Engineering.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an engineer&rsquo;s approach.</p>
<p>Yeah, engineers.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, you should learn some of that.</p>
<p>We all can use our pain against each other</p>
<p>or we can say we&rsquo;re being with engineering opportunities</p>
<p>and we can know about history.</p>
<p>So let me change something.</p>
<p>We can have a, just to be judgmental,</p>
<p>people say thou shalt not judge.</p>
<p>I was talking to Camille Vasquez.</p>
<p>She says, I&rsquo;m very judgmental.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>I believe, now you could go to Bible</p>
<p>and one thing&rsquo;s gonna say one thing,</p>
<p>another thing may be contradicted in a way</p>
<p>and then the pastor has to unpack it.</p>
<p>I believe that we are to judge.</p>
<p>If you look at some food</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s got a fly coming out of it,</p>
<p>you can then judge at that point.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re supposed to use your better judgment</p>
<p>but whenever someone doesn&rsquo;t wanna change</p>
<p>something they&rsquo;re doing, they&rsquo;ll say, don&rsquo;t judge me, right?</p>
<p>But as a species, you called for me,</p>
<p>you got the breakthrough and by the way,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s only an engineer that I would respect</p>
<p>to tell me of how to update how I&rsquo;m communicating</p>
<p>because this started off, right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been through all these interviews.</p>
<p>Let me go to this.</p>
<p>You said this was a sorry apology.</p>
<p>I was very specific.</p>
<p>I said the Jewish because by the way, it&rsquo;s a barrage, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a thing where I don&rsquo;t even remember the names</p>
<p>at a certain point, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like if a girl was getting raped by men,</p>
<p>if that person&rsquo;s not 18, right?</p>
<p>And she was getting raped since 14, right?</p>
<p>And she still got this face,</p>
<p>this super like Irina Shayk level face, right?</p>
<p>She might say, I hate men.</p>
<p>That woman may say, I hate men.</p>
<p>She might get to that point because she was raped.</p>
<p>All my contracts and no one can say this is ramped up.</p>
<p>No one, Howard Stern can&rsquo;t say this is ramped up.</p>
<p>Ari Emanuel can&rsquo;t say this is ramped up.</p>
<p>George Soros knows damn well that I&rsquo;m not ramped up.</p>
<p>George Soros knows like, wow,</p>
<p>this guy&rsquo;s like a younger guy that&rsquo;s looking at what I did</p>
<p>and looking at how I control the world silently</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s calling it out.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s not using any of the fear tactics.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t send his homeboys around him.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t send his wife to him.</p>
<p>This guy, that&rsquo;s what George Soros sees, right?</p>
<p>When he&rsquo;s dealing with me, right?</p>
<p>So what you guys are actually asking me to do,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m comparing myself to that 18 year old,</p>
<p>beautiful woman that had been mistreated by men</p>
<p>for four years of her life, right?</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re saying, as a man, you can&rsquo;t blame all men.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m saying as a responsible forward philosopher leader,</p>
<p>okay, I&rsquo;ll drop the pain and I will specify</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m up here, I lost my fucking family.</p>
<p>I lost my kids.</p>
<p>I lost my best friend in fashion.</p>
<p>I lost the black community.</p>
<p>I lost, you know, people said I lost my mind,</p>
<p>all of these things, lost my reputation.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m up here just like, I just want my family,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t want my family to have to say</p>
<p>what the left wants us to say,</p>
<p>to have to say what China wants us to say.</p>
<p>I wanna be an American and protect my kids</p>
<p>and protect my wife and raise my kids as Christians</p>
<p>and have my wife be a Christian and innovate</p>
<p>and America may rock and roll.</p>
<p>I wanna innovate as a creative person</p>
<p>and be a successful American,</p>
<p>but all of that had been taken away from me.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m coming back and I&rsquo;m removing the PSTD right now.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m standing up and saying the only way</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re gonna be able to get past this</p>
<p>and the way God is gonna use me right now</p>
<p>is for me to stop talking about the pain,</p>
<p>stop talking about what happened and do something about it.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where I&rsquo;m at right now in this moment.</p>
<p>Like, yeah, people agree,</p>
<p>at least there was something where you could say</p>
<p>he has a reason of why he got to that tweet.</p>
<p>And what you&rsquo;re doing for me today is saying,</p>
<p>yo, that was a sorry apology and let&rsquo;s specify.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not asking for anyone out here to empathize</p>
<p>or sympathize for a dude worth $11 billion</p>
<p>that can make money disappear,</p>
<p>I mean, appear at a thin air in five different industries.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not asking for anybody to sympathize</p>
<p>with someone who&rsquo;s married to Kim Kardashian,</p>
<p>dated Irina Shayk, blah, blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p>Like, I feel like I&rsquo;m just not gonna get the sympathy vote</p>
<p>in this situation, right?</p>
<p>So-</p>
<p>I feel your pain.</p>
<p>I feel your pain, yeah.</p>
<p>I feel like no one&rsquo;s gonna feel my pain,</p>
<p>only Brad and Leo can feel my pain, right?</p>
<p>But still.</p>
<p>But here today, when you said it&rsquo;s a sorry apology,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the apology that you&rsquo;re looking for</p>
<p>as a Jewish engineer?</p>
<p>And I say, as Lex, let&rsquo;s not talk about you being Jewish,</p>
<p>as Lex, what&rsquo;s the apology that you want me to say</p>
<p>to, am I allowed to say Jewish?</p>
<p>Tell me, is it anti-Semitic for Ye to say Jewish out loud?</p>
<p>No, there&rsquo;s, I don&rsquo;t like the aloud</p>
<p>that presumes censorship.</p>
<p>I think you choose, you have a powerful voice.</p>
<p>Did I prove, did I prove that there was censorship</p>
<p>over the past two weeks?</p>
<p>I proved it. Who censored you?</p>
<p>Oh, Drink Champs.</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s, oh my Lord.</p>
<p>Oh, like Twitter and so on?</p>
<p>Twitter.</p>
<p>That has less to do-</p>
<p>Drink Champs.</p>
<p>That hurt you, the Drink Champs,</p>
<p>that Noah took it down, took down your conversation?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t hurt you?</p>
<p>Man, you gotta be honest about the pain.</p>
<p>‚ô™ We&rsquo;re still the kids we used to be ‚ô™</p>
<p>‚ô™ I put my hand on the stove to see if I still bleed ‚ô™</p>
<p>‚ô™ And nothing hurts anymore, I feel kind of free ‚ô™</p>
<p>Noah, do you think,</p>
<p>you know, I went to Japan for two to three months, right?</p>
<p>The day I had Sunday service,</p>
<p>my kids are supposed to be there</p>
<p>and my kids were nowhere to be found.</p>
<p>And I text Kim and said, where are my kids?</p>
<p>We get into an argument</p>
<p>and then I get a text from a number I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s Pete Davidson bragging</p>
<p>about being in bed with my wife.</p>
<p>Then-</p>
<p>Just fucking with you?</p>
<p>Well, at that point, it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re trying to put me in jail</p>
<p>or put a friend of mine in jail</p>
<p>because then I&rsquo;m gonna go surround the hotel</p>
<p>and do something which would have me not be able to be here.</p>
<p>And instead I walked away from that situation.</p>
<p>I went to Japan, like the samurai that I am</p>
<p>and went to the top of the mountain.</p>
<p>And because I knew that, I mean,</p>
<p>I knew there was no way she could love this dude,</p>
<p>not just because he&rsquo;s ugly, he&rsquo;s not black.</p>
<p>She likes black guys.</p>
<p>Every guy that she, you know, is with looks exactly the same.</p>
<p>Ray J, Reggie Bush, at that time Kanye West,</p>
<p>she has a type, just like how I have a type.</p>
<p>Like a lot of my girls look kind of similar to her</p>
<p>because in a video game character,</p>
<p>people have their type, right?</p>
<p>So I knew that this was like-</p>
<p>The princess has a type and she likes Mario.</p>
<p>Right, there you go.</p>
<p>As somebody who cares for you</p>
<p>and hopefully can be a friend, yay.</p>
<p>I gotta say these words and the words about Jews</p>
<p>is not the words of a samurai, of a great man.</p>
<p>I would say, you know, you said something that inspired,</p>
<p>that resonated with a lot of people</p>
<p>when you said George Bush doesn&rsquo;t care about black people.</p>
<p>I have to say, as somebody who cares for you,</p>
<p>that yay, the artist formerly known as Kanye West</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t care about Jewish people.</p>
<p>In the same way you spoke about George Bush</p>
<p>being a politician and not giving a fuck</p>
<p>about the poor people that suffered after Katrina,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not giving a fuck about the suffering</p>
<p>of the Jewish people across the world.</p>
<p>Why am I not?</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;re feeding, you&rsquo;re giving strength,</p>
<p>motivation to hate groups.</p>
<p>But we already updated, I gave an apology,</p>
<p>you said it wasn&rsquo;t good enough.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>And now you&rsquo;re telling me, no, I&rsquo;m not gonna-</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need to kiss anyone&rsquo;s dick.</p>
<p>What you have to do-</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re asking me to kiss-</p>
<p>You have to say what&rsquo;s wrong to say.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no Jewish media, there&rsquo;s no Jewish-</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no control of the media by Jewish people.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re an engineer, brother.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re an engineer and you&rsquo;re not holding to the truth,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not engineering.</p>
<p>Engineering is not, that&rsquo;s not, that&rsquo;s hate,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not engineering.</p>
<p>Engineering says, I&rsquo;m gonna build a better record label.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called stereotypes.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m going to respect our-</p>
<p>Stereotypes exist for a reason.</p>
<p>Engineers don&rsquo;t do stereotypes.</p>
<p>I do.</p>
<p>Stereotypes are dumb.</p>
<p>They allow you to channel hate towards the other.</p>
<p>You know what the biggest thing is?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>With something, a veteran that was sitting next to me</p>
<p>at Cheesecake Factory last night.</p>
<p>He said, you know, the general justice,</p>
<p>he serves for whoever is the president, right?</p>
<p>And he said, what&rsquo;s happening in politics is</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re forgetting we&rsquo;re on the same side.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re forgetting we&rsquo;re on this.</p>
<p>This is someone is practically, now he&rsquo;s a nurse.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s still, you know, fighting for humanity in a way.</p>
<p>He went from holding, you know, guns in battle</p>
<p>to being a nurse.</p>
<p>And when people are battling for their lives.</p>
<p>And he said, we&rsquo;re forgetting we&rsquo;re on the same side.</p>
<p>This is a person that no matter who becomes president,</p>
<p>he can still be told to go to war.</p>
<p>And the chaos that&rsquo;s created by the media</p>
<p>has split the country in half.</p>
<p>And what we, what us as beings</p>
<p>with an engineer opportunity need to do right now</p>
<p>is find the blue water.</p>
<p>Where do we, where are places that we agree on?</p>
<p>And I want you to finish everything.</p>
<p>Hey, I&rsquo;m gonna let you finish.</p>
<p>Everything that you want to express to me.</p>
<p>Get off all, I&rsquo;m your scarecrow today.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m your punching bag today for everything I did.</p>
<p>And I want you to stand up for all of the hate</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m your Al Gore when he lost the election.</p>
<p>Remember, he almost became a punching bag</p>
<p>for the lady that had voted on him.</p>
<p>And she just said all this stuff.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, I know, I agree with you, right?</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s nothing, you know, that he could do about it.</p>
<p>With this, it&rsquo;s like things that you&rsquo;re saying,</p>
<p>I agree with you.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s like, if you sit some kids</p>
<p>in the principal&rsquo;s office and I punch somebody, right?</p>
<p>I took my hand, right, as what it really means.</p>
<p>Even Ari Emanuel had to say, this is a pop icon, right?</p>
<p>And I went and just punched an entire people</p>
<p>at one time or said that I was about to,</p>
<p>I went like this, right?</p>
<p>And I got blacked out, black mirrored, done, right?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, what were you even gonna do?</p>
<p>And why did you go like this?</p>
<p>I went like this because I can&rsquo;t even do,</p>
<p>I would look insane to physically show you a metaphor,</p>
<p>a physical representation of my last 20 years</p>
<p>of what I&rsquo;ve been through as a musician, as a father,</p>
<p>and as a black person with a political opinion.</p>
<p>A great man still through the pain does the right thing.</p>
<p>And I think the right thing is to not say</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s Jewish control of the media.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s incorrect though.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a fucking lie, there is.</p>
<p>And they did come and bully me.</p>
<p>They proved the point.</p>
<p>No, the reason you don&rsquo;t say it is</p>
<p>because the world is much bigger than the, forgive me,</p>
<p>the narrow little world you exist in.</p>
<p>Your impact stretches way past those little</p>
<p>boardroom meetings over contracts.</p>
<p>So what should I have done?</p>
<p>What should I have done?</p>
<p>Not say that you should be a strong man</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t mention religion or people and then fight.</p>
<p>Do you wanna win this fight?</p>
<p>How do I win?</p>
<p>How do we win?</p>
<p>Call out individual people built,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s one way because they have a big voice.</p>
<p>The other voice that I prefer is to build another label.</p>
<p>I feel like you&rsquo;re controlling my creative narrative</p>
<p>and my, because just like how you&rsquo;re telling me</p>
<p>I shouldn&rsquo;t have said that,</p>
<p>do you think there are people telling me</p>
<p>I shouldn&rsquo;t have wore a red hat?</p>
<p>No, because you asked me, what should I have done?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re supposed to be a scarecrow.</p>
<p>So I thought I&rsquo;m gonna beat the shit out of the scarecrow</p>
<p>with my words, right?</p>
<p>You let me, it was consensual.</p>
<p>The punching bag is a bad</p>
<p>because scarecrow actually has a different real name.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s say a punching bag, I shouldn&rsquo;t say a scarecrow.</p>
<p>But every single person that I&rsquo;ve sat with</p>
<p>from the point when I wore the red hat to now</p>
<p>has done the same thing.</p>
<p>Sit in the principal&rsquo;s office</p>
<p>and don&rsquo;t do what you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re in the general&rsquo;s closet right now together</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m not, the red hat is very different.</p>
<p>The red hat is, you have a set of beliefs,</p>
<p>you represent half the country that has a hope,</p>
<p>a vision for the future of America</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s very different than without any purpose whatsoever</p>
<p>saying Jewish media, Jewish control of the media.</p>
<p>You said that there&rsquo;s no purpose.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re taking away my history</p>
<p>and my reason of what my purpose was.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m saying, don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Also, also.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m speaking my voice, vocalizing it.</p>
<p>Also, it&rsquo;s God&rsquo;s plan.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of things that open up.</p>
<p>Let me tell you something that opened up.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a guy, like I told you,</p>
<p>that was running STEM player who I&rsquo;ve had issues with,</p>
<p>we hadn&rsquo;t got paid on time, certain things, right?</p>
<p>And he took his IQ, his know-how,</p>
<p>his engineering know-how to,</p>
<p>he basically was trying to Adidas me</p>
<p>with even though I was the bigger money in the situation.</p>
<p>That was fun and we funded together.</p>
<p>And he hired these engineers and he said,</p>
<p>well, because of your comments,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not gonna be able to hire anybody else.</p>
<p>And I was like, well, how many Jewish people</p>
<p>do we have in our company?</p>
<p>He said, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t say exactly, right?</p>
<p>I said, do we have black people?</p>
<p>He said, yes.</p>
<p>I said, how many?</p>
<p>He said, two.</p>
<p>So we have like 60 full-time employees,</p>
<p>like 40 half-time and part-time.</p>
<p>And I took as a responsibility,</p>
<p>I took as a responsibility,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s take a step back from us being one species</p>
<p>and say, hey, you&rsquo;re Jewish, I&rsquo;m black, right?</p>
<p>Why step back?</p>
<p>For this example, for the sake of this example.</p>
<p>And I said, wow, I&rsquo;m sure I can hire</p>
<p>more than two black engineers.</p>
<p>And what happens is because there are so many businessmen</p>
<p>that just so happen to be Jewish,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s good business, right?</p>
<p>That it&rsquo;s good business just to monopolize.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what people are looking.</p>
<p>Everybody wants to be Elon, right?</p>
<p>So the-</p>
<p>I disagree with that.</p>
<p>Okay, but let me finish this point.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna let you finish.</p>
<p>A lot of businessmen want to be as successful as Elon</p>
<p>and as popular as Elon, a lot.</p>
<p>Like just worded like that,</p>
<p>which I hate the term a lot, actually.</p>
<p>I wanna be more specific,</p>
<p>but I haven&rsquo;t done the math on it.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say some.</p>
<p>Factually, for sure, there are some business people</p>
<p>of all different walks and backgrounds</p>
<p>that would like to be as rich and as popular as Elon Musk.</p>
<p>So let me just take a step back from the we&rsquo;re one species</p>
<p>into the we&rsquo;re separated by race, gender,</p>
<p>socioeconomic class conversation and say,</p>
<p>as a black owner of two tech platforms,</p>
<p>hardware and software, I need to take action.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s not call it affirmative.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just say I need to take action</p>
<p>and I need to take accountability</p>
<p>in ensuring that black engineers are hired</p>
<p>and guess what?</p>
<p>Hired together.</p>
<p>Because when the black people that are brilliant</p>
<p>are separated from our culture, we forget who we are.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll get to a point where, you know,</p>
<p>OJ would say, I&rsquo;m not black, I&rsquo;m OJ.</p>
<p>Because just to be on the golf course,</p>
<p>we put on the golf shirt,</p>
<p>but the golf shirt might not be something</p>
<p>that our culture would have done.</p>
<p>And now our culture in poor communities is,</p>
<p>oh, everybody&rsquo;s got Draco on them.</p>
<p>Everybody&rsquo;s got a gun on them.</p>
<p>Oh, if you run up on me on the gas station,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna kill you.</p>
<p>Hey, you ain&rsquo;t gotta talk to me like a man</p>
<p>if I haven&rsquo;t killed at least five people.</p>
<p>But you know what happens is we can kill five people.</p>
<p>We could kill 10 people and still be in the media</p>
<p>as long as we play by the rules, right?</p>
<p>Because what would happen is any of these guys</p>
<p>that have talked about killing people</p>
<p>and different things, unless Trump had pardoned them, right?</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s say, even if Trump had pardoned them,</p>
<p>they could still go to someone like a Lil Boosie</p>
<p>or Meek Mills or Puff Daddy, anybody,</p>
<p>and say, hey, we need you to talk shit about yay right now.</p>
<p>And also, you&rsquo;re not allowed,</p>
<p>if you do want to vote for Trump</p>
<p>or vote outside of what this arrangement is,</p>
<p>then we&rsquo;re gonna put you in jail.</p>
<p>It ain&rsquo;t, we&rsquo;re not gonna bring you down.</p>
<p>We have this on you.</p>
<p>You get what I&rsquo;m saying?</p>
<p>If I had ever killed someone,</p>
<p>if I wasn&rsquo;t the bitch with the pink polo on,</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to be the vocal man that I am today.</p>
<p>You understand what I&rsquo;m saying?</p>
<p>This is the reason why I&rsquo;m happy</p>
<p>that my gangster disciple brothers</p>
<p>kept me from the initiations,</p>
<p>which made me feel like a pussy my whole life, right?</p>
<p>But now I am someone who legally can say this.</p>
<p>Other people in my position, they legally cannot speak.</p>
<p>They legally cannot speak, or they will go to prison.</p>
<p>I am in a bit of a glass prison</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t have say so</p>
<p>of where my children go to school.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m in a freedom place</p>
<p>where I can have this conversation with you right now.</p>
<p>And that is, I don&rsquo;t like the word breakthrough.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s God&rsquo;s hand on this situation.</p>
<p>But you get what I&rsquo;m saying about,</p>
<p>if I hadn&rsquo;t said the tweet,</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t have had to take the accountability myself</p>
<p>to hire black engineers into my two tech platforms.</p>
<p>Yeah, and do you get what I&rsquo;m saying?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a beautiful personal journey you&rsquo;re on.</p>
<p>But do you get what I&rsquo;m saying?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not personal, it&rsquo;s for my people as a whole.</p>
<p>As a tribal person-</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a small company.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a small company.</p>
<p>As a tribal person, I believe that I am my people.</p>
<p>And the thing that businessmen have done to my people</p>
<p>have pulled the brightest out of our tribes</p>
<p>and siloed them and made us lose our culture</p>
<p>and lose who they were.</p>
<p>All the only thing I wanted to say at Virgil&rsquo;s funeral,</p>
<p>which I wasn&rsquo;t allowed to, right?</p>
<p>It was a white pastor</p>
<p>that talked the majority of the funeral.</p>
<p>Half the funeral was pissed, pissed, right?</p>
<p>And this pastor actually married me and Kim, right?</p>
<p>He looks like Justin Timberlake a little bit.</p>
<p>And he talked half the funeral.</p>
<p>He knew Virgil was passing,</p>
<p>did a collaboration with him before he passed, by the way,</p>
<p>right, a clothing collaboration.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know Virgil was passing,</p>
<p>but the thing I wanted to say,</p>
<p>I saw A$AP Rocky and I saw some other members of his gang</p>
<p>in the audience at the funeral.</p>
<p>And all I wanted to tell him is,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t let them split the gang up.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t let them split the gang up.</p>
<p>When I did the first Yeezy,</p>
<p>because I did Kanye West two fashion shows before</p>
<p>as a high-end luxury, all leather kind of designer,</p>
<p>not all leather, but high-end materials,</p>
<p>mink, this kind of thing.</p>
<p>And then I came back with Yeezy, with Adidas.</p>
<p>And this fashion show was so popular</p>
<p>that Justin Bieber had to sit in the second row, right?</p>
<p>This thing had every name you could think of.</p>
<p>It had Kim Kardashian, Kris Jenner, Kendall Jenner.</p>
<p>It was Kylie&rsquo;s first fashion show she&rsquo;d been in.</p>
<p>And in the second fashion show,</p>
<p>I put Kylie and Bella Hadid next to each other</p>
<p>in the fashion show.</p>
<p>You had Puff Daddy.</p>
<p>At that time, Puff Daddy had beef with Drake.</p>
<p>Drake still came to the show,</p>
<p>and Jay-Z had to break up the fight backstage.</p>
<p>The designers, you had Jerry Lorenzo,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s head of Fear God.</p>
<p>You had Kim Schraub, head of Skims.</p>
<p>You had Virgil Abloh, head of Louis Vuitton.</p>
<p>You had Demna, head of Balenciaga,</p>
<p>all working for Ye, for the leader,</p>
<p>for the philosopher, right?</p>
<p>For the person that put, who put this together?</p>
<p>Me, that&rsquo;s who, right?</p>
<p>You had these people working for the King of New York,</p>
<p>basically the boss, Ye, right?</p>
<p>You had Jay-Z in the audience, Rihanna in the audience,</p>
<p>Beyonce in the audience,</p>
<p>sitting next to Anna Wintour in this audience.</p>
<p>And guess who heard wind of this?</p>
<p>One of the richest men in the world,</p>
<p>Bernard Arnault, caught wind of this.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s going on?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re building up something, and we need to stop it.</p>
<p>So then he met with me and politely offered me backing</p>
<p>for my clothing line.</p>
<p>It would be Kanye West.</p>
<p>They would get 49%, 51%, I would get 49%.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;d have control, and they were gonna give me</p>
<p>all of the support from Louis Vuitton.</p>
<p>So I had to go to Adidas, and I told Adidas,</p>
<p>hey, let&rsquo;s Ademinify the apparel.</p>
<p>So Adidas, you&rsquo;re not gonna do the apparel anymore.</p>
<p>Hey, we had a good time,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re gonna run off with Giselle now, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like you told your girl that,</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s like, oh, no, we&rsquo;re supposed to,</p>
<p>we had the proudest moment of our career.</p>
<p>So then he offers me to deal,</p>
<p>and Alexander Arnault, who&rsquo;s went to gone on</p>
<p>and raped and pillaged from all of the talent</p>
<p>that I had afterwards, said, I say,</p>
<p>before I tell Adidas to Ademinify the apparel,</p>
<p>can I get a written contract from your dad, Bernard Arnault?</p>
<p>And he says, my dad will never go back on his word.</p>
<p>So you already know where this thing is going, right?</p>
<p>You can, spoiler alert, right?</p>
<p>He went back on his word.</p>
<p>So three months into the deal, I get Anna Wintour.</p>
<p>I say, who should I use for my lawyer?</p>
<p>She picks my lawyer for me, right?</p>
<p>I just found out even a couple of days</p>
<p>that the lawyer demanded an airplane during negotiations.</p>
<p>Had nothing to do with me, right?</p>
<p>They said that Bernard Arnault got freaked out,</p>
<p>and then Alexander Arnault calls me and says,</p>
<p>the deal got dropped at the board.</p>
<p>I went back and told my high-maintenance wife,</p>
<p>I was supposed to become this designer at Louis Vuitton,</p>
<p>or the Louis Vuitton group was gonna back</p>
<p>the Kanye West line,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s how good I&rsquo;ve done in fashion, babe.</p>
<p>And now the deal is dropped.</p>
<p>Now the deal is dropped.</p>
<p>So then I did a second collection,</p>
<p>and we didn&rsquo;t have any support</p>
<p>to be able to build the collection.</p>
<p>Then I went and found, and third collection, we did it.</p>
<p>We took over MSG.</p>
<p>Fourth collection went, and the show started a hour late.</p>
<p>Then a week later, Kim got robbed.</p>
<p>Then I told Scooter Braun, my manager at that time,</p>
<p>I say, I&rsquo;m looking, I need to go to Japan.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m tired, I&rsquo;m tired.</p>
<p>He says, no, you need to make more money.</p>
<p>I do four more shows on a second leg of the tour,</p>
<p>and I suffer from exhaustion and go to the hospital,</p>
<p>and then get diagnosed with a disorder.</p>
<p>This is the first time I ever suffered from exhaustion.</p>
<p>By the way, I haven&rsquo;t been to the hospital since.</p>
<p>Haven&rsquo;t been to the hospital since,</p>
<p>and haven&rsquo;t taken medication in two years.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;ll be people in the media,</p>
<p>we won&rsquo;t say, where from, we&rsquo;ll say,</p>
<p>well, that&rsquo;s obvious, right?</p>
<p>So right now, I&rsquo;m talking to you, right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not on medication.</p>
<p>I just go to sleep, right?</p>
<p>I have sleep.</p>
<p>Have you been able to sleep?</p>
<p>This, that&rsquo;s too low-hanging fruit for you.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re more, I expect more.</p>
<p>I agree, I agree.</p>
<p>I expect more.</p>
<p>I agree, that was dumb.</p>
<p>I regret it as soon as I said it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like Piers Morgan trying to grab ratings.</p>
<p>You got a whole life ahead of you.</p>
<p>You got a whole life ahead of you.</p>
<p>These guys are at the end of their life.</p>
<p>Good, good, good.</p>
<p>So this story is.</p>
<p>Call me out on my shit, I love it.</p>
<p>But then, amidst that, the same guy</p>
<p>that dropped my deal, Bernard Arnault,</p>
<p>goes and hires my best friend.</p>
<p>Goes and hires my main engineer, right?</p>
<p>It would have been like them hiring Elon from Peter</p>
<p>before they figured out Paul,</p>
<p>before they figured out PayPal.</p>
<p>But it don&rsquo;t, Paul even sounds like,</p>
<p>it don&rsquo;t, Paul sounds like Paul.</p>
<p>I just say it because I&rsquo;m a Christian.</p>
<p>I thought it was cool.</p>
<p>But it would have been like,</p>
<p>what if someone could have went in</p>
<p>and took Elon away from Peter before they paid Paul?</p>
<p>Before they, I just, because they paid Paul.</p>
<p>Yeah, before they paid Paul.</p>
<p>Before they, it&rsquo;s just too close.</p>
<p>Yeah, too close.</p>
<p>It just sounds so fresh, the fact that it&rsquo;s so close, right?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s what happened, right?</p>
<p>They broke the gang up.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m telling you right now,</p>
<p>that hadn&rsquo;t happened, Virgil&rsquo;s alive, I&rsquo;m still married.</p>
<p>You know what I&rsquo;m saying?</p>
<p>The power structure was broken then, right?</p>
<p>Because we were building some,</p>
<p>Kylie wasn&rsquo;t a billionaire, you know what I mean?</p>
<p>We were building something together</p>
<p>that a French colonizer came in and caught it early</p>
<p>and tried to destroy it.</p>
<p>But the only thing is God is alive and I&rsquo;m anointed.</p>
<p>And even with those drawbacks, losing my wife,</p>
<p>losing my friend, exhaustion,</p>
<p>all of these late night tweets</p>
<p>that piss off an entire group, you know, like this,</p>
<p>the frustration still there.</p>
<p>We work, I work for God and God runs the world</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll see what, we&rsquo;ll see what happens.</p>
<p>But in those words, don&rsquo;t you feel that being split up,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t you feel you&rsquo;re doing the thing</p>
<p>that you stand against, which is playing victim?</p>
<p>Aren&rsquo;t you playing victim to the forces in the world?</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t play victim, I didn&rsquo;t even get a chance to play.</p>
<p>I just said I was about to.</p>
<p>I said like this, like.</p>
<p>No, you played pretty damn well.</p>
<p>What do you mean?</p>
<p>What do you mean about to?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like one of the greatest designers in history,</p>
<p>fashion designers.</p>
<p>You were playing, you are playing.</p>
<p>What does that even mean?</p>
<p>I thought you were referring to the tweet,</p>
<p>instead of playing victim there.</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s a full set of things</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re under attack for,</p>
<p>the tweet and everything beyond that.</p>
<p>But like you&rsquo;re blaming, not blaming,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re saying that the Jewish media,</p>
<p>the Jewish record label, the Jewish people,</p>
<p>forget Jewish or not, it doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s playing victim, right?</p>
<p>Ultimately, I am fighting a battle in the spiritual form.</p>
<p>And anyone that believes in God</p>
<p>and is looking at this interview would agree with that.</p>
<p>And I just so happen to be a bright part of God&rsquo;s army.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m fighting for us to live.</p>
<p>The greatest gift is life itself.</p>
<p>I am pro-life.</p>
<p>I am pro-God.</p>
<p>I believe that Jesus Christ is our Lord and Savior</p>
<p>and died for our sins.</p>
<p>What do you feel about another attack,</p>
<p>another painful thing?</p>
<p>I imagine super painful is Balenciaga pulling,</p>
<p>you had a really close relationship and friendship</p>
<p>with their creative director.</p>
<p>Like, how do you feel about all of it?</p>
<p>I told you, I sang the song.</p>
<p>I sing another song from one of my mentor&rsquo;s future.</p>
<p>I never feel pain.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d have felt too much pain.</p>
<p>Like, there was a day where I was headed to Nashville</p>
<p>to meet with George Farmer, who is the CEO of Parla,</p>
<p>the day when we made the announcement.</p>
<p>At that same day, Balenciaga was taking my imagery</p>
<p>off of their site.</p>
<p>And the Drink Champs was being taken down.</p>
<p>And I said, this is the happiest day of my life.</p>
<p>I love cutting the grass low.</p>
<p>People wasn&rsquo;t really with you, they was part-time.</p>
<p>People switch up when it&rsquo;s wartime.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d rather have people who are really with me</p>
<p>and not people who are just trying to use me.</p>
<p>Listen, as a friend, somebody cares for you,</p>
<p>you have to be really careful by the people,</p>
<p>by all people, always.</p>
<p>The people that are gonna be trying to be close to you now,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t know if you can trust them anymore than-</p>
<p>Even more.</p>
<p>With the Balenciaga, I have more to say about it, though.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s do this.</p>
<p>Dimna will still work for Ye someday.</p>
<p>And this is just speeding the process up.</p>
<p>Have you talked?</p>
<p>Can you share if you&rsquo;ve talked?</p>
<p>Yes, I talked to Dimna.</p>
<p>This is like, we&rsquo;re kindred spirits.</p>
<p>None of this can keep us away from each other.</p>
<p>I brought Dimna to Gap</p>
<p>to be able to bring the best product in the world.</p>
<p>At that time, I wanted to go under $100.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m like, okay, we&rsquo;re gonna go $20 a product.</p>
<p>I brought Dimna in to engineer,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why I said engineer by Balenciaga,</p>
<p>Yeezy Gap engineer by Balenciaga,</p>
<p>to engineer the best product for the people.</p>
<p>The people that they say are at the bottom</p>
<p>of the Maslow hierarchy and need chart,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re at the bottom of the pyramid, right?</p>
<p>So Gap didn&rsquo;t want that.</p>
<p>Balenciaga didn&rsquo;t want that.</p>
<p>Our agendas were not aligned.</p>
<p>I was brought in to the Gap</p>
<p>for political reasons and influence,</p>
<p>like a Virgil, like a George Floyd.</p>
<p>When popular celebrities are brought</p>
<p>into Fortune 500 companies, it&rsquo;s not to raise the stock.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s to strengthen the position and influence.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s definitely not to be out here</p>
<p>letting a nigga think he Steve Jobs.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s people like that.</p>
<p>But you, as a great man, a visionary,</p>
<p>your job is to understand that game and be one step ahead.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m telling them.</p>
<p>That relationship, you know some relationships</p>
<p>only last for a summer?</p>
<p>You know, some last for a year.</p>
<p>The relationship ran its course.</p>
<p>In that relationship, I invested a lot</p>
<p>of my social capital and actual capital.</p>
<p>I spent somewhere between five to $10 million</p>
<p>personally on Balenciaga.</p>
<p>How much money do you think Balenciaga had paid me</p>
<p>in the past two years?</p>
<p>Just take a really wild guess, a really wild guess.</p>
<p>Less than that?</p>
<p>Just take a super wild one.</p>
<p>Just go to the furthest extent of your imagination.</p>
<p>1.2 million.</p>
<p>Lower.</p>
<p>500,000.</p>
<p>Lower.</p>
<p>Zero.</p>
<p>Zero.</p>
<p>And actually, two weeks ago, I paid at a Saint&rsquo;s account</p>
<p>$862,000, not in clothes for me from Balenciaga</p>
<p>from the store, in royalties to Balenciaga</p>
<p>where the deal had been engineered</p>
<p>where I was coming out of my pocket.</p>
<p>So I paid, last year I paid Demna $3 million</p>
<p>to design the collection, right?</p>
<p>And we got it out of the Gap Marketing Fund</p>
<p>and he was gonna deliver 160 SKUs or 120 SKUs.</p>
<p>100 SKUs are separate items of clothing,</p>
<p>so styles of clothing.</p>
<p>So he ended up delivering about 60.</p>
<p>I feel like we&rsquo;re on the people&rsquo;s court</p>
<p>because we actually are, right?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re in the court of public opinion.</p>
<p>So he delivered about 60.</p>
<p>There were all kinds of people that were working.</p>
<p>Part of the reason why I had to get Demna,</p>
<p>like I didn&rsquo;t wanna have to, I wanted to compete with him.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t wanna have to like get him.</p>
<p>You know, when I made Stronger,</p>
<p>I did it to compete with Timbaland and Justin Timberlake</p>
<p>because my fiance at that time liked Justin Timberlake</p>
<p>just a little bit too much.</p>
<p>So I made it to compete and then we had the song out.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s number one on Apple, it&rsquo;s blowing up.</p>
<p>I play it in a club and it sounds muddy.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t sound the way Sexy Back sounded in the club.</p>
<p>So I go to Pharrell Williams to do the drums</p>
<p>and it doesn&rsquo;t, it sounds like a different record.</p>
<p>And so it can&rsquo;t be a different record</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m like, I&rsquo;m gonna swap it out on radio, right?</p>
<p>Then I go to Swiss Beats.</p>
<p>It sounds like a different record.</p>
<p>I go to Timbaland, the person who did Sexy Back</p>
<p>and he did it in five minutes</p>
<p>and then spent the rest of the hour talking about</p>
<p>how nobody could have done it except for him,</p>
<p>running around the studio.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m the best.</p>
<p>No one could, that&rsquo;s why he had to go to me.</p>
<p>He had to go to the king.</p>
<p>Well, he had a point, right?</p>
<p>He had a point, right?</p>
<p>What makes the song muddy?</p>
<p>Is it the beat?</p>
<p>It was in the drums.</p>
<p>It was something that Timbaland had in those drums.</p>
<p>Now watch this.</p>
<p>I said I&rsquo;m going Def Con 3, right?</p>
<p>And the actual, I spelled it wrong.</p>
<p>I have a tendency to do that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not quite John Legend, tight sweater level,</p>
<p>spelling B level.</p>
<p>So I feel a parallel to me going to Timbaland</p>
<p>to when I said, hey, you as an engineer,</p>
<p>I need to work with you as an engineer that is Jewish</p>
<p>to look at these contracts and what my people,</p>
<p>not just black people, let&rsquo;s say artists</p>
<p>are dealing with in our contracts.</p>
<p>These contracts need to be fixed.</p>
<p>Everyone could be so mad at the messenger, right?</p>
<p>Yay, you said it the wrong way.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re offensive.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like Hitler now because you said it.</p>
<p>You said this out loud, but it does not,</p>
<p>you weren&rsquo;t getting enough sleep.</p>
<p>All this shit does not negate the fact</p>
<p>that we do have Houston, we have a problem.</p>
<p>Yeah, but we is just the music industry.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of hate that was created</p>
<p>by just saying that, you know?</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re saying what is just is everything to me, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>One person can mean everything to me, right?</p>
<p>And for George Bush, winning an election was everything.</p>
<p>And then when you said George Bush doesn&rsquo;t care</p>
<p>about black people, that you woke him up.</p>
<p>You woke the people up to the fact</p>
<p>that he was narrowly being selfish.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a sense to which you&rsquo;re being corrupted</p>
<p>by your own greatness.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re focusing too much on the industry</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve made great, that you&rsquo;ve rose to the very top.</p>
<p>One of the richest artists in history,</p>
<p>one of the greatest designers.</p>
<p>I am the richest artist in history.</p>
<p>Probably the richest artist in history.</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t, you know.</p>
<p>The funny thing is they&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>oh, richest black person, like,</p>
<p>oh, also richest actor, richest musician,</p>
<p>richest fashion designer.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s a bunch of richest in that one.</p>
<p>You know what I&rsquo;m saying?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like richer than Ralph Lauren,</p>
<p>like richer than Imani, like richest, like of that.</p>
<p>But still low, because where do you put that,</p>
<p>you know, like on the totem?</p>
<p>Because I don&rsquo;t even want to-</p>
<p>Man&rsquo;s bank account isn&rsquo;t everything.</p>
<p>I would say you and I are equal in a certain deep sense,</p>
<p>no matter what the bank account says.</p>
<p>Vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom.</p>
<p>So I wanted to give you some theme music for your moments.</p>
<p>It sounded a little muddy.</p>
<p>Let me give you the Timberland version.</p>
<p>Vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>But okay.</p>
<p>Play that at the club.</p>
<p>So the other thing about, like say like Balenciaga is,</p>
<p>Demna will work with Ye someday.</p>
<p>And</p>
<p>for Cedric and for Francois Pinot,</p>
<p>and Salma is a beautiful human being.</p>
<p>Five years from now,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll hear and know the name Ye</p>
<p>and know things that we did.</p>
<p>And Balenciaga is not going to make it onto your questions.</p>
<p>Would you, as a gambling man, would you bet on that?</p>
<p>I would bet on that.</p>
<p>I can see it in your eyes.</p>
<p>Let me ask you a-</p>
<p>So it was actually a sad day for me.</p>
<p>Not for me, but more for Balenciaga.</p>
<p>I just, when I heard that, I was just like,</p>
<p>oh, shame.</p>
<p>Let me ask you a silly question just about Demna.</p>
<p>I read something that you two talked about,</p>
<p>like buttons, for a few hours.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re my gumdrop buttons.</p>
<p>Just in that accent.</p>
<p>Me and Demna only speak in Shrek.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your philosophy with which you approach design?</p>
<p>You are one of the great fashion designers of our time.</p>
<p>How do you think about it?</p>
<p>Do you have a philosophy?</p>
<p>You know what I like about the zipper is,</p>
<p>the zipper hoodie replaces the dress shirt,</p>
<p>because you could get on your douchebag shit</p>
<p>and unzip it and give it a little bit of that type of look.</p>
<p>Which is the douchebag?</p>
<p>You know, like when the douchebags that go to Vegas</p>
<p>and unbutton their dress shirt?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>And the problem with the pullover hoodie is</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t do the douchebag thing where you unbutton it,</p>
<p>but then still get the stomach,</p>
<p>because the thing is, the ultimate look would be like,</p>
<p>you know, military tank, pullover hoodie,</p>
<p>and if you get a little hot, you take off the hoodie,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re like crazy in shape.</p>
<p>So it gives you that flexibility.</p>
<p>Yeah, the zipper&rsquo;s giving some flexibility,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like, maybe you want to keep your jacket on,</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s considered like a hoodie to be like a jacket.</p>
<p>If you want to keep your jacket on,</p>
<p>then you might want to do this,</p>
<p>as opposed to pulling it all the way off.</p>
<p>You know, so, and it&rsquo;s just comfort,</p>
<p>but then you get, okay, can I do a jogging pant on this?</p>
<p>What elasticity?</p>
<p>Now, people argue about climate,</p>
<p>where we are with the climate.</p>
<p>I take a responsibility as being</p>
<p>the most influential designer of all time</p>
<p>to say we&rsquo;re gonna use biodegradable clothing.</p>
<p>Now, the issue there is,</p>
<p>the elastic is not biodegradable.</p>
<p>So that means it&rsquo;s actually better to use jeans and a belt</p>
<p>than to have an elastic waistband,</p>
<p>because elastic waistband is not biodegradable.</p>
<p>So I use the planet as a big,</p>
<p>the future of the planet is a big piece</p>
<p>of the way I engineer</p>
<p>and the way we talk about where designs are going.</p>
<p>The constraints on your design and engineering</p>
<p>is given by the planet, by the future of the planet.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>That could almost make Jewish people like me again.</p>
<p>Every time you say Jewish people,</p>
<p>I think I may be reading a little too much</p>
<p>about World War II, but man,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d recommend you listen to some audio books</p>
<p>or read some books on the Holocaust,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s heavy, it&rsquo;s heavy.</p>
<p>It will put into context the impact of your words.</p>
<p>Would you read books on the current Holocaust</p>
<p>that black people are in?</p>
<p>I mean, I read.</p>
<p>What have you read about abortion?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve read a lot of short form writing</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve listened to a lot of debates,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s really humbling that the question</p>
<p>of when does life begin is a really difficult question.</p>
<p>For me as an engineer and scientist,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a philosophical question.</p>
<p>I mean, we could just go on population control,</p>
<p>not like if abortion is right or wrong.</p>
<p>We could say factually the clinics were made</p>
<p>by eugenics for population control</p>
<p>and it is controlling the population</p>
<p>as is the never being given a 40 acres and a mule,</p>
<p>so you don&rsquo;t have the opportunity.</p>
<p>And when the people that do have the opportunity</p>
<p>are separated from our people, our tribe</p>
<p>and placed in suburban communities next to us,</p>
<p>Chris Rocco put it, the dentist,</p>
<p>and whitewashed and made to shut the fuck up</p>
<p>and vote left or whatever niggers are supposed to do</p>
<p>when we make it.</p>
<p>As opposed to saying, okay, we&rsquo;re building schools,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re building up choirs, we&rsquo;re building up our own leagues,</p>
<p>basketball teams, our own factories.</p>
<p>We started the first sportswear factory in America</p>
<p>since World War II was actually this factory</p>
<p>I put in Cody.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m 45 years old.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re on this journey right now.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the other thing about this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like people, just in general, they love me so much.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m actually a hard guy to really hate</p>
<p>for a long period of time just because of my huge cock.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I noticed.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t understand why you showed it to me</p>
<p>when we first met, but now I understand.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s very nice.</p>
<p>Congratulations.</p>
<p>I know you don&rsquo;t talk about it, but your hat does say 24.</p>
<p>If you run for president,</p>
<p>what kind of ideas would you represent?</p>
<p>That we&rsquo;re beings with engineering opportunities.</p>
<p>I would represent</p>
<p>a platform.</p>
<p>Just as you served a platform here,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something that happened on my last run</p>
<p>that I thought, I feel, I know was brilliant.</p>
<p>It was noisy, but it was brilliant.</p>
<p>I had one rally and in the rally,</p>
<p>I just let people come up and I gave them a platform.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s our responsibility to listen to the pain</p>
<p>and hear the pain and understand,</p>
<p>even when we&rsquo;re the ones that cause the pain,</p>
<p>like with my tweet.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s my responsibility to hear you</p>
<p>and understand why you feel like that,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s our responsibility as a people</p>
<p>to understand each other.</p>
<p>To give people a voice.</p>
<p>People need the voice and even right now,</p>
<p>what I&rsquo;m doing or how God is using me,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m showing where our voices are being muted.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s professors that are actually intelligent,</p>
<p>actually have multiple degrees</p>
<p>that have been canceled from their schools</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t have a music industry</p>
<p>or a fan base or a shoe design</p>
<p>or a smoking hot ex-wife to complain about.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve just got the truth of what they saw</p>
<p>and what they dedicated to this country</p>
<p>and to education that has been muted</p>
<p>by schools that have been taken over with an agenda.</p>
<p>You want the brightest minds to be these professors</p>
<p>and then you mute them and they have nowhere to go.</p>
<p>And you might get a guy now</p>
<p>that went from being someone&rsquo;s favorite professor</p>
<p>to he&rsquo;s working at Starbucks like he was back at school</p>
<p>or like he was back in high school.</p>
<p>So even if that voice is about anger and hate,</p>
<p>it still deserves to be heard.</p>
<p>Yeah, it deserves to be heard</p>
<p>and we deserve to ask why.</p>
<p>You have to ask why.</p>
<p>I just feel like that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>I feel like that is sympathizing with Mr. Hugecock.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just saying that it just needs to be.</p>
<p>You should change that to your name on Twitter</p>
<p>while you&rsquo;re still allowed on there.</p>
<p>Yeah, do you think that would get censored?</p>
<p>I feel like they definitely cut it down some inches.</p>
<p>The, I&rsquo;m pointing out this,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pointing out this truth.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m serious.</p>
<p>This is not a Christian thing, right?</p>
<p>And you know, I wonder right there,</p>
<p>when I say these jokes, is it something that,</p>
<p>cause I do feel like laughter is the key,</p>
<p>engineering and laughter, right?</p>
<p>Is the key to peace.</p>
<p>Like when I go get my teeth cleaned</p>
<p>and I have the nitrous,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something that I wanna go and hug Kris Jenner.</p>
<p>I wanna go and hug Corey Gamble.</p>
<p>I wanna go and hug, you know, Howard Stern.</p>
<p>No one wants to hug Howard Stern,</p>
<p>but you know, just if one of them.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s, I would love to see you two hug it out</p>
<p>and make up, even though all this shit</p>
<p>talking back and forth.</p>
<p>What about talking it out</p>
<p>or is he gonna be screaming at me?</p>
<p>Yeah, judgmental and that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>I hope there&rsquo;s love there.</p>
<p>You know, the thing is,</p>
<p>I think Howard&rsquo;s just jealous.</p>
<p>You know, not just jealous of my cock.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s also,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s jealous that I started my campaign earlier than him.</p>
<p>You gotta let go of that jealousy.</p>
<p>You gotta let go of that jealousy, Howard.</p>
<p>You gotta let go.</p>
<p>Howard and everybody else.</p>
<p>Jealousy is a natural human thing, man.</p>
<p>I wonder just as a Christian, right?</p>
<p>When I joke and say this stuff,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, hmm, am I being disobedient to God?</p>
<p>Because as a boss, right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll talk to</p>
<p>an employee and I&rsquo;ll be like,</p>
<p>why didn&rsquo;t you just listen?</p>
<p>Because I&rsquo;ve got the bigger plan, right?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like me talking to God</p>
<p>were the things that I did in this interview</p>
<p>that were disobedient to God.</p>
<p>And for those things, I pray and I repent</p>
<p>for anything that I&rsquo;ve said that was disobedient to God.</p>
<p>But humor is not one of them.</p>
<p>Joking.</p>
<p>I feel like humor is the way we avoid</p>
<p>so much suffering in the world.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the way to, it&rsquo;s like a catalyst for love.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s a way to,</p>
<p>people that have gone through some of the darkest trauma</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve ever met through war.</p>
<p>I just came back from Ukraine.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re laughing.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re making jokes.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the best way to deal with dark times.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what it is about humans.</p>
<p>I feel like humor,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the best way to socially engineer a good future,</p>
<p>I think, is humor.</p>
<p>Not taking shit too seriously.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the problem with censorship.</p>
<p>One of the things that really suffer is humor.</p>
<p>Jokes.</p>
<p>Maybe going too far in the jokes.</p>
<p>You mentioned Anthony Jeselnik.</p>
<p>That guy goes hard.</p>
<p>That guy goes really hard and it&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>He crosses all the lines and that&rsquo;s why he&rsquo;s a genius.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what people feel is refreshing when he does it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what it is.</p>
<p>But then it&rsquo;s like hurtful when I do it.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ll tell you something that was interesting.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pretty sure Anthony doesn&rsquo;t like,</p>
<p>sorry for the assumption,</p>
<p>but just most comedians I know didn&rsquo;t vote for Trump.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>Not saying there aren&rsquo;t comedians that did,</p>
<p>but just the ones I know,</p>
<p>because I live in California, right?</p>
<p>But they have an appreciation for Trump</p>
<p>because of the sense of humor.</p>
<p>Gotta ask you about parlor engineering,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m interested about that.</p>
<p>Doom, doom, doom, doom.</p>
<p>Hey man, I&rsquo;m actually trying to hold it together.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re pretty offensive towards a lot.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not looking to be offensive.</p>
<p>I really want to bring people together</p>
<p>and get these sales done.</p>
<p>I know, but 100% I see your vision.</p>
<p>How do we do that?</p>
<p>Well, don&rsquo;t say Jewish media</p>
<p>and Jewish controlled media.</p>
<p>JM.</p>
<p>Like, man, you sound like,</p>
<p>it sounds too much like 1930s Nazi Germany</p>
<p>that was leading up to the atrocities.</p>
<p>Oh, he would say JM?</p>
<p>Yeah, he was a brand of JM, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s just the implied,</p>
<p>like this meme-ified</p>
<p>prejudice towards a group</p>
<p>in a way that&rsquo;s going to lead to hate.</p>
<p>And I know you don&rsquo;t mean that.</p>
<p>I know you have love in your heart.</p>
<p>You know what&rsquo;s the prejudice</p>
<p>towards a group that led to hate?</p>
<p>BLM.</p>
<p>BLM took a black person,</p>
<p>showed his death on camera,</p>
<p>because, okay, there are examples</p>
<p>of us being killed and being killed on camera.</p>
<p>But if it was spread on camera,</p>
<p>it was done on purpose by the media.</p>
<p>Because 14, 20 kids get killed in Chicago every week,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not spread that much.</p>
<p>They, like you said, singled out a person</p>
<p>and directed everything on that person as the martyr,</p>
<p>and raised the people that hadn&rsquo;t had any.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t have our 40 acres and a mule.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t have a lot of things</p>
<p>that black people have not ever been given.</p>
<p>So once we&rsquo;re given just a little bit,</p>
<p>your life matters,</p>
<p>then we literally like, oh, okay, now we&rsquo;re being heard.</p>
<p>But actually, the death toll is up.</p>
<p>The city where this happened</p>
<p>has completely been turned to a war zone.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually something,</p>
<p>like Candace Owens can actually specify this better,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s like its own city or something.</p>
<p>They made it not be a part of the actual state or something.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like DC and stuff.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like Washington, DC now and stuff.</p>
<p>And that has to be from a government,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s got higher level agenda written all over it.</p>
<p>Yeah, they&rsquo;re using the death of an individual.</p>
<p>Yeah, sure, the media are.</p>
<p>Not the Jewish media, the media.</p>
<p>The media.</p>
<p>And the media is fucked up.</p>
<p>That machine takes whatever tragedy</p>
<p>and pushes it towards whatever narrative</p>
<p>that gets more clicks and views and so on.</p>
<p>Sure, and then politicians do the same.</p>
<p>They use the media, they influence the media</p>
<p>to tell a story.</p>
<p>This is a simple thing I&rsquo;ll put.</p>
<p>I believe that the idea of anti-Semitism</p>
<p>and the closeness of the Holocaust</p>
<p>is used by certain individuals</p>
<p>and media to not take accountability</p>
<p>for the bad things that are happening.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s happening is there&rsquo;s a new frontier,</p>
<p>meaning it used to be okay for somebody to be a billionaire.</p>
<p>We thought about a billionaire.</p>
<p>A lot of times you think of actually being out of shape</p>
<p>and 20 years ago, 30 years ago,</p>
<p>like Onassis or something.</p>
<p>You thought about it a different way.</p>
<p>Now you think about a billionaire,</p>
<p>you think about Elon, you think Kim, you think Ye,</p>
<p>you think it&rsquo;s a new kind of billionaire.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just Soros is a billionaire.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a new form of billionaire.</p>
<p>Well, right now what I&rsquo;m calling for the industry</p>
<p>is I&rsquo;m calling the industry out and saying like,</p>
<p>hey, it just so happens that there&rsquo;s been times</p>
<p>where I had, my lawyer was Jewish,</p>
<p>my regulator was Jewish, but like eight people</p>
<p>that basically would collude and talk without me</p>
<p>were in groups saying, okay,</p>
<p>this is what the tour is gonna be.</p>
<p>This is this next house.</p>
<p>And they were making all these decisions</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re making all this money.</p>
<p>And at the end, I was like, I ended my tour</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t have the money.</p>
<p>And it just so happens that that&rsquo;s the case</p>
<p>that what they were.</p>
<p>But what I&rsquo;m saying is if everyone can say,</p>
<p>hey, you can&rsquo;t point out this fact,</p>
<p>or we&rsquo;re gonna say you&rsquo;re anti-Semitic</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re gonna call you Hitler.</p>
<p>I feel that there has to be at least 1% of safeguarding</p>
<p>the ability to screw the artists</p>
<p>based on saying it&rsquo;s anti-Semitic</p>
<p>by pointing out that they just so happen to all be Jewish.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s anti-Semitism.</p>
<p>I just think that&rsquo;s, hey, this is another thing.</p>
<p>Like, okay, the Kardashians, when you hear that,</p>
<p>do you think male or do you think female?</p>
<p>You think female.</p>
<p>You get what I&rsquo;m saying?</p>
<p>You think this is the realities.</p>
<p>This is why rap works, right?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re gonna make an anti-women thing in a second, right?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s gonna say, well, if you point out</p>
<p>that these five women, six women are having a meeting</p>
<p>on where the Christmas party is</p>
<p>and none of the ballplayers or rappers</p>
<p>that they have babies with have any say-so</p>
<p>so that Christmas happened at Kourtney&rsquo;s house</p>
<p>all eight years when I was there.</p>
<p>And it never happened at anyone else&rsquo;s</p>
<p>black family house, right?</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m the one that pointed it out,</p>
<p>they just don&rsquo;t have, they don&rsquo;t have their,</p>
<p>or your anti-Semitic word to say, shut the fuck up.</p>
<p>Yeah, but-</p>
<p>Because this is the way it runs</p>
<p>and this is the way we want to do it.</p>
<p>If you say that women are silencing the black voice,</p>
<p>yes, you&rsquo;re gonna get the same response,</p>
<p>but especially if it historically resonates.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the fact that it&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>When you talk in groups, that breeds hate.</p>
<p>When you talk about individuals, it solves problems.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re in engineering.</p>
<p>Okay, but this is something I pointed out on Pierce.</p>
<p>I said, if a black person gets pulled over with a car</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s three other people in the car,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re also going to jail.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not going to single them out.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re gonna say, you guys are all in collusion.</p>
<p>I just described collusion five times in this interview.</p>
<p>And you keep on going back to, this is like 1930.</p>
<p>This is like this, this is like that.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m saying is, look,</p>
<p>I want to work with you as an engineer to free my people.</p>
<p>Can we start as a being</p>
<p>with engineer opportunities right here?</p>
<p>I am sorry to the people who had to be hurt</p>
<p>and affected by that.</p>
<p>Now we are here and I&rsquo;m looking to solve it.</p>
<p>But what happens is every time,</p>
<p>if I talk to any of these business people one by one,</p>
<p>because mind you, I didn&rsquo;t get to the tweet</p>
<p>by not having a conversation.</p>
<p>I had the conversations beforehand</p>
<p>before I got to the tweet.</p>
<p>Now we&rsquo;re going to take it to the stage.</p>
<p>Now we&rsquo;re on the world stage, right?</p>
<p>And you saw Ari Emanuel do exactly the kind of thing</p>
<p>that I was saying had been done behind closed doors.</p>
<p>Now he&rsquo;s doing it and open doors.</p>
<p>They told Candace Owens, I couldn&rsquo;t be on the Daily Wire.</p>
<p>Like you can&rsquo;t even explain yourself.</p>
<p>And we don&rsquo;t care how you got to that point either.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s fucked up.</p>
<p>They told Candace you can&rsquo;t be on Daily Wire?</p>
<p>Is that even about, yes, she did.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what they said.</p>
<p>And you know what?</p>
<p>And you can have my voice raised or lower.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to do it lower, right?</p>
<p>And what I mean by that is,</p>
<p>what I mean to me by, I&rsquo;ll put it in your words,</p>
<p>the media is saying,</p>
<p>not only can you not explain yourself,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t care how you got to that point.</p>
<p>You need to apologize and you can&rsquo;t explain.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the end of the story.</p>
<p>So just apologize so we can have Mel Gibson</p>
<p>do some more films.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s exactly what Ari Emanuel was saying.</p>
<p>No one is looking to change the problem</p>
<p>to that same level of frustration.</p>
<p>And I just so happen to be the one</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not going to back up on it until this changes.</p>
<p>Because you know what?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry I had a sleepy text.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry I wrote, I&rsquo;m sorry for everything.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry that I put,</p>
<p>that I was 5'12 or 5'11 on Tinder, okay?</p>
<p>My cock is not 14 inches.</p>
<p>I lied, okay?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s only 13.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m sorry, right?</p>
<p>So the-</p>
<p>Why are you dropping so many facts today?</p>
<p>So what I&rsquo;m saying is,</p>
<p>but where do we get to this?</p>
<p>Because even you, as engineering,</p>
<p>as intelligent as you are,</p>
<p>you, just like everyone else that I say was colluding,</p>
<p>won&rsquo;t let us get to the point of fixing it.</p>
<p>Yeah, but I&rsquo;m not,</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re more powerful than the media.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying you need to apologize because the media,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m saying everything we&rsquo;ve been talking about,</p>
<p>just because I care for you</p>
<p>and I want you to be the best possible man you can be.</p>
<p>To me, a definition of a great man,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m with Martin Luther King on this.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t talk about Jews or black people.</p>
<p>You talk about engineering,</p>
<p>you talk about humanity, you solve problems.</p>
<p>You identify the problems in the world</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t come from a place of resentment.</p>
<p>This group did this, this, fuck all that.</p>
<p>That is in the past.</p>
<p>You just build solutions.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna create a new record label.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna create a new design firm.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna create a new social network.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna do it better, I&rsquo;m gonna do it right.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna do it right by the people</p>
<p>that I know don&rsquo;t have a voice.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna give them a voice and talk about that.</p>
<p>Is it okay to call out collusion?</p>
<p>Do people collude in your business under you?</p>
<p>Like the engineers, they come together and say,</p>
<p>they collude against the bosses, right?</p>
<p>You know why Bernard Arnault offered the deal</p>
<p>and took it away from me?</p>
<p>Collusion.</p>
<p>Because I was too powerful</p>
<p>with the collective that I had right there.</p>
<p>He had to stop that at all costs.</p>
<p>They said, for whatever reason, this kid, yay,</p>
<p>it has the ability to have all of the Kardashians,</p>
<p>Jay-Z and Beyonce, Justin Bieber, Demna, Virgil,</p>
<p>all these people in the same room</p>
<p>working towards the same goal.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been that person since preschool.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s called a leader, right?</p>
<p>And right now, what I&rsquo;m saying is,</p>
<p>hey, for the people in business,</p>
<p>whatever their background is,</p>
<p>whether they turn their cell phones off on Friday or not,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s been some bad business done.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some bad business practices.</p>
<p>And we have to change that</p>
<p>because this game is like boxing.</p>
<p>More people end up retarded than rich.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m saying like beat to a pulp, driven crazy,</p>
<p>beat by the media to a pulp.</p>
<p>Right now, the media has done everything they could</p>
<p>to make me apologize and to make me look crazy.</p>
<p>And that one person has done anything</p>
<p>to find out why I was frustrated enough to do that tweet.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s facts, and that&rsquo;s fucked up.</p>
<p>Well, I was hoping to.</p>
<p>I am finding out.</p>
<p>We found out, but I want solutions.</p>
<p>See, there&rsquo;s something about human nature</p>
<p>where if you focus too much on resentment.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not focusing on it anymore.</p>
<p>Fuck the resentment, we&rsquo;re moving forward.</p>
<p>Right, so there&rsquo;s two things, I think,</p>
<p>that are required for,</p>
<p>I mean, this is how I&rsquo;ve lived my life,</p>
<p>for great engineering.</p>
<p>You surround yourself in your personal life</p>
<p>by people you trust.</p>
<p>And then in your professional life,</p>
<p>from the engineering perspective,</p>
<p>with a team, with an incredible team,</p>
<p>and everything else doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>That allows you not to focus on other groups,</p>
<p>how they&rsquo;re fucking you over,</p>
<p>how they&rsquo;re like trying to manipulate or collude</p>
<p>and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>You focus on solutions,</p>
<p>and you find a way around all the difficult shit.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>If you have people in your life you can trust.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s lifelong.</p>
<p>You said some people you&rsquo;re with for the summer,</p>
<p>for a year, find people you can be with</p>
<p>for your whole life.</p>
<p>Do you have people in your life that you trust?</p>
<p>Like, really trust?</p>
<p>No, I trust God.</p>
<p>At any point, a human being can,</p>
<p>like, I could like,</p>
<p>if I go and like,</p>
<p>really treat this guy like a piece of shit</p>
<p>or do this, da-da-da,</p>
<p>am I supposed to trust him to be loyal</p>
<p>and stay in the situation?</p>
<p>No, I trust people to be people,</p>
<p>and people are flawed.</p>
<p>And people can have the right intentions,</p>
<p>but it only makes sense for us to work together</p>
<p>when our agendas align.</p>
<p>When Kim was pulled really far to the left,</p>
<p>our agendas no longer aligned.</p>
<p>So that made the marriage impossible.</p>
<p>It aligned where it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>oh, I could wear a red hat</p>
<p>that can help her to get Alice Johnson out of jail</p>
<p>because Trump&rsquo;s willing to do that for my wife</p>
<p>because I was the only person in my position</p>
<p>that stood up and said,</p>
<p>wait a second, I like you.</p>
<p>But isn&rsquo;t there a deeper agenda,</p>
<p>the human agenda of just being in love?</p>
<p>What you&rsquo;re talking about,</p>
<p>red hat is just politics, right?</p>
<p>I mean, the world is becoming more</p>
<p>and more transactional every day.</p>
<p>And actually, marriages are actually</p>
<p>originally based on transactions.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re less needed,</p>
<p>the more autonomous as we come,</p>
<p>or the world makes it less needed.</p>
<p>I feel like we do need each other.</p>
<p>I feel like we do need someone we can always count on.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like I&rsquo;m, yay, pulled away by King Koopa,</p>
<p>which is the media, the politics, the promise,</p>
<p>oh, we&rsquo;re gonna keep you safe.</p>
<p>So the reason why I get really frustrated</p>
<p>with Kris Jenner is she says,</p>
<p>losing Rob Kardashian was the greatest mistake of her life,</p>
<p>but she never gave Kim&rsquo;s hand over in marriage</p>
<p>because this is the bottom line.</p>
<p>When me and Kim met,</p>
<p>we were millionaires or whatever, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re telling me you just hand her hand over in marriage</p>
<p>that your daughter&rsquo;s not successful,</p>
<p>handing your hand over in marriage to,</p>
<p>but no, she had to still be the husband</p>
<p>to all of her daughters.</p>
<p>And we see what the results are consistently.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s where I get frustrated.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, let that go.</p>
<p>Let this person do what you made mistakes on.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t make this person relive those same mistakes</p>
<p>and then put that agenda into my daughters too.</p>
<p>Is there somebody in your life close to you</p>
<p>that you trust enough to call you out on your bullshit?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re all full of shit sometimes.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s my bullshit?</p>
<p>Well, some of it I pointed out today,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t know you deeply enough.</p>
<p>What was the bullshit?</p>
<p>Jewish media, Jewish.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not bullshit.</p>
<p>The bullshit is that the Jewish media won&rsquo;t admit.</p>
<p>Your dad was right.</p>
<p>Your dad was right.</p>
<p>The words you used, you weren&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And I said it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not gonna make me say it 800 more times.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it resonated</p>
<p>because you keep saying like the words.</p>
<p>Did it resonate to y&rsquo;all that y&rsquo;all</p>
<p>ain&rsquo;t do nothing about it?</p>
<p>And that all y&rsquo;all wanna do is have somebody apologize</p>
<p>and sweep under the rug your bullshit</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve been doing the whole time.</p>
<p>You own the same bullshit as the other people.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re doing the same thing that the other,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say media,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m not allowed to say, has done.</p>
<p>So until somebody stands up.</p>
<p>Which is what, man?</p>
<p>Which is what?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to call you out on your bullshit</p>
<p>because I hope I&rsquo;m somebody you can trust.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t fucking trust you.</p>
<p>Well, you should find people in your life you can trust.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t tell me what I should do.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not one of your BLM marchers.</p>
<p>Listen, I&rsquo;m with you on the BLM.</p>
<p>A lot of organizations use tragedy.</p>
<p>And I watched the Candace Owens documentary.</p>
<p>And what was your take on it?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s important to question the mainstream narratives</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t agree with it.</p>
<p>I still believe that George Floyd died</p>
<p>from the knee of the cop, not from fentanyl.</p>
<p>And even if that was the case,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s still 50% of black deaths is actually abortion.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s get into engineering.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just go.</p>
<p>How do you fix that?</p>
<p>Population control is social engineering.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s most literal form.</p>
<p>The blacks that are under population control,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s something that, I mean, that&rsquo;s just what it is.</p>
<p>African Americans are not choosing to get the abortion.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s a choice.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an individual choice.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;re being influenced to.</p>
<p>Well, then speak to the community and help.</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t know what the engineering solutions</p>
<p>there are.</p>
<p>It could be you&rsquo;re doing that in part</p>
<p>by speaking to the value and the power of family.</p>
<p>Well, watch this.</p>
<p>I was building shelters.</p>
<p>I bought land in Calabasas.</p>
<p>I bought two ranches in Wyoming.</p>
<p>300 acres in Calabasas, 12,000 acres in total in Wyoming.</p>
<p>And I started building ideas for shelters.</p>
<p>And God set it on my heart to make monasteries,</p>
<p>which would be modern day facilities</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t turn people down, that have farms,</p>
<p>that have shelter, clothing.</p>
<p>But first of all, water.</p>
<p>First of all, knowledge.</p>
<p>Because knowledge is the most important resource</p>
<p>to our species above water.</p>
<p>Knowledge itself.</p>
<p>Because then you can go get water.</p>
<p>I mean, you can argue like if you&rsquo;re a baby,</p>
<p>how do you get water?</p>
<p>But the baby doesn&rsquo;t have it.</p>
<p>So someone with the knowledge then feeds the baby the water.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s important that those with the knowledge</p>
<p>teach the baby how to find the water themselves.</p>
<p>And the business people that I&rsquo;ve been dealing with</p>
<p>have been keeping the baby sick</p>
<p>by not sharing the information and the knowledge</p>
<p>with inside of those contracts.</p>
<p>My people are sick.</p>
<p>If I load up Apple Music right now</p>
<p>and I play the top songs in the rap chart,</p>
<p>I will tell you my people are sick.</p>
<p>If I go to the restaurants in Opportunity Zones</p>
<p>and we look at the calorie rating and the cholesterol,</p>
<p>I will tell you that my people are sick.</p>
<p>If we look at the obesity rate,</p>
<p>if you go to just a restaurant somewhere</p>
<p>in middle America, Denny&rsquo;s or something,</p>
<p>I went to Denny&rsquo;s the other day,</p>
<p>you will see that my people are sick.</p>
<p>And my people meaning all people, right?</p>
<p>But black people are very influential to all people.</p>
<p>So if the media picks a overweight black woman</p>
<p>and says this is body goals,</p>
<p>then the media are influencing my people to stay sick.</p>
<p>And it just so happens that that night</p>
<p>I was so frustrated after 20 years</p>
<p>that I had to call it out in one tweet that now,</p>
<p>even if I say, hey, okay,</p>
<p>I was frustrated for these reasons,</p>
<p>now it&rsquo;s not good enough.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve literally tried to make me re-apologize</p>
<p>10 times in this meeting, re-say this, re-say that,</p>
<p>but it doesn&rsquo;t change the fact that my people are sick</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m the only person in my position</p>
<p>that will say that my people are sick.</p>
<p>Today, not 30 years ago, not 60 years,</p>
<p>but my people are sick today.</p>
<p>50% of my people&rsquo;s deaths are abortion today.</p>
<p>My people don&rsquo;t have the opportunities today,</p>
<p>even to the point that,</p>
<p>because if JP Morgan had been nice to me</p>
<p>and if Alex Klein, a STEM player,</p>
<p>had been fair to me at different things,</p>
<p>then I wouldn&rsquo;t even point it out</p>
<p>that we don&rsquo;t have any black, we have two black engineers.</p>
<p>So I have to have a responsibility, obviously to all people,</p>
<p>but specifically to my tribe,</p>
<p>because tribes move.</p>
<p>Tribalism is real with black people.</p>
<p>To separate the brightest from the tribe</p>
<p>or to separate the leaders,</p>
<p>it is factual that the CIA removed the leaders</p>
<p>from the black community, put crack in the communities,</p>
<p>put guns in the communities,</p>
<p>and locked up all the leaders and called them gangly.</p>
<p>Locked up all the leaders, locked up all the fathers.</p>
<p>Now 72% of black mothers are raising children by themselves.</p>
<p>This is agenda like a Tuskegee experiment</p>
<p>set on my people, right?</p>
<p>And what I&rsquo;m calling out</p>
<p>for the black people in entertainment is,</p>
<p>what are we doing?</p>
<p>We have to collude.</p>
<p>And if we don&rsquo;t collude, because even if I said,</p>
<p>hey, I&rsquo;d like to make a company that&rsquo;s all black,</p>
<p>right, is that okay for me to say?</p>
<p>Is that okay for me to say?</p>
<p>Or is that anti-Semitic?</p>
<p>See, if I hadn&rsquo;t crossed the line so far,</p>
<p>then that would have sounded anti-Semitic.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;ve stretched a bit.</p>
<p>So now we can go to, okay, let&rsquo;s make an all black company.</p>
<p>But that would have been anti-Semitic.</p>
<p>Just that concept,</p>
<p>because you could word that in a different way</p>
<p>that would sound anti-Semitic.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, man.</p>
<p>I have to be-</p>
<p>No, no, listen.</p>
<p>If I said I didn&rsquo;t want to have the Jewish people</p>
<p>in the company, would that be anti-Semitic?</p>
<p>It would sound like it, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d say I&rsquo;m from 1930s, right?</p>
<p>But for me as a tribe to say,</p>
<p>no, I want an all black company, right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m generally against that kind of thing.</p>
<p>But first of all, you have the right</p>
<p>to do whatever the hell you want.</p>
<p>This is America.</p>
<p>Well, what I&rsquo;m saying is that&rsquo;s what I feel</p>
<p>may need to happen for my people to have power again.</p>
<p>Because when my people have been left</p>
<p>under the media&rsquo;s control, we&rsquo;ve been made sick.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been allowed to be sick.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been promoted, and we&rsquo;re promoting sickness.</p>
<p>I think, at least in the engineering realm,</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t met an engineer who happens to be black</p>
<p>who would like to be called a black engineer.</p>
<p>And when you have a company of all black people</p>
<p>that are engineers, I don&rsquo;t know the creative arts,</p>
<p>I apologize, but engineering,</p>
<p>they really try to look at each other as humans</p>
<p>and look at the problem.</p>
<p>And you want to know, you want to have the confidence</p>
<p>that everybody on the team is the best possible person</p>
<p>for the job.</p>
<p>What I can say is the world is sick,</p>
<p>and I have slight images of utopia,</p>
<p>slight images of happiness, slight images</p>
<p>as a visionary and a creator.</p>
<p>And I know for a fact the way that business deals</p>
<p>have been done for me are keeping the world sick.</p>
<p>Fix them.</p>
<p>I see that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re trying to do.</p>
<p>And you probably, listen, people should not doubt, yay.</p>
<p>But I gotta tell you, I have to be honest,</p>
<p>this is silly, because you don&rsquo;t know me,</p>
<p>but it hurt when you say you don&rsquo;t trust me.</p>
<p>You kind of lost me.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think anyone&rsquo;s ever said that to me.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, man.</p>
<p>Fuck that.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care about views or clickbait</p>
<p>or any of that bullshit.</p>
<p>I just thought you were one of the greatest artists ever.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d be cool to talk to you.</p>
<p>And I just, I feel like you got pain you&rsquo;re working through.</p>
<p>And never had anyone say that to me.</p>
<p>Maybe I&rsquo;m just being a mess about it, I guess.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fucked up, though.</p>
<p>But maybe it&rsquo;s not, maybe you shouldn&rsquo;t trust it,</p>
<p>but I just haven&rsquo;t had that experience.</p>
<p>Yeah, do you think I would trust anybody</p>
<p>at this point in my life?</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s tough.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s tough, it&rsquo;s tough, I hear you.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s also kind of good to see how much strength you got.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not broken by any of this.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re under a lot of attack.</p>
<p>A lot of attack by a lot of people.</p>
<p>You have a vision, and you&rsquo;re trying to feel</p>
<p>your way through it.</p>
<p>And you might get destroyed for it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the human, that&rsquo;s the risk you take.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a wonderful life, though.</p>
<p>What do you hope your legacy is?</p>
<p>To be forgotten.</p>
<p>You think it would be forgotten?</p>
<p>Because the memory, there&rsquo;s ego in memory,</p>
<p>in the memories.</p>
<p>Who designed the sidewalk?</p>
<p>Who designed the water fountain?</p>
<p>Who designed the stop sign?</p>
<p>Who designed the stoplight?</p>
<p>These things are so ubiquitous that the person</p>
<p>that designed them is forgotten.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s a good idea, it&rsquo;s a God idea.</p>
<p>And no VCs can own it.</p>
<p>So you want your designs in all realms of life</p>
<p>to be so simple that they permeate everything.</p>
<p>They take over, and you&rsquo;re forgotten.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a successful design, is you&rsquo;re forgotten.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Do you have advice for people?</p>
<p>A lot, a lot, a lot of young people look up to you.</p>
<p>Do you have advice for young people</p>
<p>of how to live a life they can be proud of?</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t tweet while you&rsquo;re sleepy.</p>
<p>Take a nap?</p>
<p>Surely there&rsquo;s other things.</p>
<p>I love the humor.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t take it seriously, I suppose, is what that means.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t send sleepy tweets.</p>
<p>Unless you buy your own social platform</p>
<p>the very next week, call Parler.</p>
<p>But other than that, if you&rsquo;re not gonna buy</p>
<p>your own social platform, then don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Is that why you bought Parler, so you could be sleepy</p>
<p>and send messages out into the wild?</p>
<p>I actually am really interested</p>
<p>in the engineering aspects of Parler.</p>
<p>Is there a vision there?</p>
<p>Because I&rsquo;m also super interested in Elon buying Twitter.</p>
<p>I like Instagram better than Twitter.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m sure Mark Zuckerberg liked Instagram</p>
<p>better than Facebook, or saw how valuable Instagram was.</p>
<p>And he bought it.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;d like to take Parler or something,</p>
<p>whatever is the magic that makes Instagram work,</p>
<p>you wanna push it there?</p>
<p>Well, I thought it was interesting how it felt</p>
<p>like Snapchat made the Kardashians bully Instagram.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the point of Snapchat going to war on Instagram?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, just everyone wants to say,</p>
<p>well, this is our value, Snapchat.</p>
<p>No one wants to lose their value</p>
<p>to someone else&rsquo;s value, whatever.</p>
<p>And everything is just, what&rsquo;s the difference</p>
<p>between permanent and temporary?</p>
<p>You know, is this a permanent structure?</p>
<p>And until God says it&rsquo;s not, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like nothing&rsquo;s permanent.</p>
<p>Our life is not permanent.</p>
<p>So how do we just let go of those things?</p>
<p>Even like going from the name Kanye West to Ye,</p>
<p>was the beginning of just letting go of some things,</p>
<p>of these titles.</p>
<p>Like we need to remove the titles.</p>
<p>Like, hey, if I have to leave Adidas</p>
<p>and I have to go next computers,</p>
<p>that may take me out of the billionaire standing altogether.</p>
<p>And I gotta get low for however long God says</p>
<p>I have to get low and refocus.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been reshaping, refocusing my staff.</p>
<p>I had some people that were good</p>
<p>and I had some people that weren&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I had too many people and I&rsquo;ve got a vision inside of me</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m like, this is how I make this vision.</p>
<p>I have to bring this vision to life.</p>
<p>I have to bring these houses to life.</p>
<p>I was talking to one of our architects on,</p>
<p>you know, we&rsquo;re actually getting close on it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve like built it a few times.</p>
<p>I had like the domes you probably saw</p>
<p>and I said, you know, how he transformed Kim&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>And no, we&rsquo;re getting there, like.</p>
<p>So you wanna get into architecture?</p>
<p>Like you really want this to become physical reality?</p>
<p>Yes, and I&rsquo;ve got close.</p>
<p>Rome wasn&rsquo;t built to today.</p>
<p>Yeah, but Rome had to start somewhere.</p>
<p>I gotta call you out on the advice.</p>
<p>There really is a lot of people that look up to you</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve lived a really difficult life</p>
<p>and you made it through all of it.</p>
<p>What do you advise them to do?</p>
<p>Do everything that you feel,</p>
<p>even if you are told that it&rsquo;s the wrong thing.</p>
<p>No, no, no, no, no, but not anything violent.</p>
<p>So do what you feel, say what you feel,</p>
<p>like trust your heart.</p>
<p>Yeah, trust your gut, trust your instincts</p>
<p>because that instinct is who God made you to be.</p>
<p>Not, you know, what lines up with your like frat brothers</p>
<p>or what lines up with what your dad wanted</p>
<p>or what lines up with your classmates or, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just God has something inside of you.</p>
<p>And when you walk down the street,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re thinking about it</p>
<p>and then you just see it in the window</p>
<p>and you go down another street and you see the same thing</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re thinking about a number and that number pops up</p>
<p>or you see it on a license plate.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s just, you know,</p>
<p>something is trying to say, be the maximum.</p>
<p>Yay, you know, be the maximum you</p>
<p>and God will give you anything that you can&rsquo;t handle.</p>
<p>So for me, everything is a yes.</p>
<p>I think they say be like water.</p>
<p>I know Bruce Lee said that.</p>
<p>Or matter of fact, just be</p>
<p>because we are beings with engineering opportunities.</p>
<p>Beautifully put.</p>
<p>Yay.</p>
<p>I have hope, I have faith that however this turns out</p>
<p>that you have the skill and the capacity</p>
<p>to really add love to the world and I hope you do that.</p>
<p>I really, really hope you do that.</p>
<p>And we talked about the tension of that,</p>
<p>the challenges and the opportunities of that.</p>
<p>I mean, I see how we could be of use to each other.</p>
<p>You actually have a particular thing for me</p>
<p>as I eject from media.</p>
<p>Because even also, you know, I&rsquo;m really big at like,</p>
<p>you know, burning the Phoenix too.</p>
<p>All you know as an engineer</p>
<p>that your cells completely regenerate every seven years.</p>
<p>I think I rush the process a little bit.</p>
<p>So I run around looking like a burn victim sometimes.</p>
<p>Yeah, but I gotta tell you, anyone I am close with,</p>
<p>I work with, there has to be trust, there has to be love.</p>
<p>And I think you&rsquo;ve been burned quite a bit in your life.</p>
<p>Sometimes I did it myself.</p>
<p>I put my hand on the stove.</p>
<p>So how do we get to engineering?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a deal to be done here.</p>
<p>Not saying you&rsquo;re making this money off of that,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m making that money off.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s-</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care about money, by the way.</p>
<p>Same, twins.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s dealings here.</p>
<p>You got pain, I got pain,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re beings with engineering opportunities.</p>
<p>For a long time, I thought somebody</p>
<p>should create a new social network.</p>
<p>And it looks like great engineering could do that.</p>
<p>You got two at one time</p>
<p>from two of your homeboys at one time.</p>
<p>Yeah, and that&rsquo;s a great way.</p>
<p>I mean, you know, it can be done from scratch</p>
<p>or it can be done anew</p>
<p>with an already established platform.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m very excited by that possibility.</p>
<p>Parler is smaller, Twitter is larger.</p>
<p>I wonder whether you can do</p>
<p>any kind of revolutionary engineering with a large company.</p>
<p>If anyone can, I would say it&rsquo;s Elon.</p>
<p>Well, Elon can look at what we do over here.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I like, God does this a lot of times.</p>
<p>He creates doppelgangers.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of examples where a theory happened</p>
<p>two places at one time,</p>
<p>a really similar type of personality happens at one time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s weird, it&rsquo;s beautiful.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hilarious, actually.</p>
<p>Yeah. It&rsquo;s kind of humorous.</p>
<p>So we should just share every piece of information together</p>
<p>as I go build Parler and as he builds up Twitter</p>
<p>and see how to make both those better.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ll be like, hey,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not gonna let Snapchat bully me out of,</p>
<p>you know, adding something to it that&rsquo;s best.</p>
<p>It should just be the best platform possible.</p>
<p>That means that, you know,</p>
<p>that means TikTok has amazing features.</p>
<p>Twitter has amazing things about it.</p>
<p>I know this girl that&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>I like Instagram better than Twitter.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, she likes it, Twitter has porn.</p>
<p>But other than that, Instagram.</p>
<p>But I was like, well, Instagram is porn also.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like soft, it&rsquo;s more subtle.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not telling you, it&rsquo;s not conservative by any means.</p>
<p>You know, and.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s the thing,</p>
<p>you have to please a lot of people with these platforms.</p>
<p>And I think the goal of a platform should be</p>
<p>to help individuals maximize their long-term happiness</p>
<p>and growth, like intellectually, spiritually,</p>
<p>psychologically, all of that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a tricky thing to figure out how to do that.</p>
<p>Of course, you could just have a platform</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just strictly for fun.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s where TikTok leans.</p>
<p>But there has, I think there&rsquo;s a balance to strike.</p>
<p>Like Twitter, there&rsquo;s a lot of intellectual,</p>
<p>philosophical stuff going on on Twitter,</p>
<p>but it somehow currently makes it too easy</p>
<p>to be divisive and hateful towards each other</p>
<p>and cancel and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>I think we need to have these healthy conversations.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what it is, healthy conversations, healthy dialogues.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the biggest thing, like,</p>
<p>when I first wore the red hat,</p>
<p>the conversation is less healthy than it is today.</p>
<p>The conversation about George Floyd,</p>
<p>you know, it&rsquo;s like, did I send the tweet the right way?</p>
<p>Did, is Candace Owens documentary perfect?</p>
<p>Is what Michael Moore, is that documentary perfect?</p>
<p>Is Century Self, is it fully accurate?</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s two to three hours</p>
<p>of a transmit of information through a particular,</p>
<p>usually one person&rsquo;s view.</p>
<p>And anything you want to research,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re interested in it,</p>
<p>you gotta look at 10 versions of it, 20 versions of it.</p>
<p>George Floyd, we&rsquo;ve looked at one version of that.</p>
<p>Now we have a second.</p>
<p>Well, by the time we get to the,</p>
<p>you know, I know this is like,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not my last hoodie,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s definitely not my first hoodie that I put on.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s like, that&rsquo;s how we got to it.</p>
<p>Like even this particular size of zipper</p>
<p>or the fact that, you know,</p>
<p>for people who know, they know that it&rsquo;s like Carhartt,</p>
<p>even though the Carhartt tag isn&rsquo;t there anymore,</p>
<p>you just know by the shape of it, you feel it.</p>
<p>So it abstracts, it takes into like this cubist place,</p>
<p>like Picasso or Matisse or African cubism</p>
<p>or Dire Straits,</p>
<p>money for nothing and your chicks for free.</p>
<p>Look at that.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t think you could reference Dire Straits.</p>
<p>Look at you.</p>
<p>That video.</p>
<p>Yeah, I know.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a great video.</p>
<p>Your encyclopedic knowledge of music is great.</p>
<p>I think that, you know, porn is not just sexual.</p>
<p>That term actually relates to torture.</p>
<p>Like, you know what I&rsquo;m saying?</p>
<p>Like watching people beat each other up</p>
<p>on Worldstar or something, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, that&rsquo;s called torture porn.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also food porn.</p>
<p>How do you explain that?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s food porn?</p>
<p>Food porn is like looking at really delicious cakes</p>
<p>and cookies and steak and so on,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re like, holy shit.</p>
<p>Exactly, architecture.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s people who love architecture.</p>
<p>When they see architecture, I know,</p>
<p>I got friends that be like, oh, that&rsquo;s porn.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Architecture.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, that&rsquo;s like love,</p>
<p>like dopamine-fueled love for a thing.</p>
<p>Yeah, we need, that&rsquo;s beautiful.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s beautiful.</p>
<p>Well, I think-</p>
<p>As long as nobody&rsquo;s getting hurt.</p>
<p>The intoxication that people have,</p>
<p>you know, the worst part is like</p>
<p>when one person&rsquo;s in love and the other person&rsquo;s in like.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s us right now.</p>
<p>Well, who&rsquo;s in like?</p>
<p>No, because you said you love Bill Maher and you like me.</p>
<p>And I love you, so that was.</p>
<p>No, I actually love you both.</p>
<p>All right, all right.</p>
<p>And the funny thing is like as a visionary,</p>
<p>visionaries are more extreme than business people</p>
<p>because a visionary would do bad business for their vision.</p>
<p>A business person will never do bad business.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s well put.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s really well put.</p>
<p>So when you say I don&rsquo;t care about money,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, yeah, I feel you.</p>
<p>Like I feel that I care in a way that I need that.</p>
<p>But I care about the vision that I have</p>
<p>to a Steve Jobs level to the point of putting that</p>
<p>putting that above my regular human existence,</p>
<p>meaning having to go and take all the arrows</p>
<p>that I become a soldier of the vision</p>
<p>because someone could say, a wife could say to,</p>
<p>like say like in the 60s,</p>
<p>their husband&rsquo;s about to go to war.</p>
<p>The wife may not want their husband to go to war,</p>
<p>because of their children,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s going to war because of their children.</p>
<p>Definitely, do you regret any aspect</p>
<p>of just giving everything to your vision?</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;ve spoken about that saying like,</p>
<p>I got fucked over in the business side.</p>
<p>I promise that I had to stop envying cool people</p>
<p>at their current cool time.</p>
<p>If anything, if someone&rsquo;s cool,</p>
<p>and I say their name a lot,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to flash the light on them so much</p>
<p>that it ages their coolness.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually a war technique, showered in compliments.</p>
<p>You know, because that, that you,</p>
<p>to be able to stay at 45 years old</p>
<p>and still be the bad kid in class,</p>
<p>at 45, I&rsquo;m still in the principal&rsquo;s office.</p>
<p>Because if you look at like, say fashion, right?</p>
<p>If you think of something fashionable,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s probably going to look like the kid</p>
<p>in the principal&rsquo;s office.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s going to be the fashion.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s part of the reason why I&rsquo;m the most influential</p>
<p>person at fashion,</p>
<p>in fashion because I refuse to leave the principal&rsquo;s office.</p>
<p>If the substitute teacher comes in,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to say, you got a big butt.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m going to get, and they go.</p>
<p>Right back, right back to the principal&rsquo;s office.</p>
<p>And people are going to be like, yo,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what you keep on saying.</p>
<p>Like, who can we talk to?</p>
<p>Because no one can talk to me.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m out of control, bro.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just God, then me, and then fuck everybody.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how I, that&rsquo;s really how I live my life.</p>
<p>And I would just want to say this one thing</p>
<p>about the children thing.</p>
<p>I wanted to, you know, put that point together,</p>
<p>put that idea together that I don&rsquo;t like the word point.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really big on like words, words being powerful,</p>
<p>says the person with the sleepy tweet.</p>
<p>So-</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re full of contradictions.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m a human being, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like some days I&rsquo;m like,</p>
<p>I could go 30 days and be celibate.</p>
<p>You know, like really, like I&rsquo;m a monk.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m being like faithful to God.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;ll go like working out, no carbs.</p>
<p>Like my weight will fluctuate and I&rsquo;ll have times</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, I don&rsquo;t feel like being told what to do.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t want to work out with a trainer.</p>
<p>And I just want to drink this Hennessy.</p>
<p>But I want to say this thing that I will text to Kim.</p>
<p>Sometimes I&rsquo;ll say, you know,</p>
<p>you may not understand what I&rsquo;m doing right now,</p>
<p>but you will.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what I would say to everyone.</p>
<p>You may not understand what I&rsquo;m doing.</p>
<p>And this gives a little bit, maybe we&rsquo;re like 20% there,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s still going to be people.</p>
<p>We leave this interview and they&rsquo;ll be like,</p>
<p>I still don&rsquo;t like the way he apologized.</p>
<p>I still don&rsquo;t want to say what my involvement would have been</p>
<p>to make him, lead him to that point.</p>
<p>And we just want things to be how they are.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s people in the world who want the world</p>
<p>to stay as it is.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s people who want to change the world.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s happened throughout time.</p>
<p>They say that with Da Vinci halfway into a conversation,</p>
<p>he could not suffer fools so much that he would walk away</p>
<p>halfway into the conversation.</p>
<p>And I said, well, that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s the Da Vinci code</p>
<p>and not the Da Vinci world.</p>
<p>And every time I go and piss off a group of people</p>
<p>or do these things, on some end,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like I could be turning my thing</p>
<p>from a potential world vision to a code,</p>
<p>or I could be opening up conversations with new friends</p>
<p>that I may trust someday.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s beautiful.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s beautiful because the change you will have</p>
<p>on the world that you don&rsquo;t know for sure,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;ll happen across years, even decades.</p>
<p>So you have to think in the future.</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;re working in the future.</p>
<p>Your actions are working in the future.</p>
<p>And a lot of people will judge this conversation</p>
<p>and others you&rsquo;ve done and so on in the present.</p>
<p>And that doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>You know why I apologize, why I say I&rsquo;m sorry</p>
<p>to the Jewish people that I hurt?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not about, like I said,</p>
<p>oh, I said, I&rsquo;m not gonna hold this apology hostage, right?</p>
<p>Obviously it&rsquo;s about God, but God is everything, right?</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the point of even having language</p>
<p>and being, you can&rsquo;t engineer if you say God, God, God,</p>
<p>right, it&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s God asks us to be judgmental</p>
<p>so that you become, if you&rsquo;re a doctor, right,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s your judgment that saves grandma, right?</p>
<p>And God puts that in this, like we have God inside us.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re a piece of God also, right?</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m gonna go specific to a person.</p>
<p>That story about Da Vinci alone is enough of a reason</p>
<p>for me to give a sincere apology to the Jewish people</p>
<p>because I do believe that there&rsquo;s a Da Vinci code</p>
<p>inside of all of my misspellings and scribbles right here</p>
<p>that God wants me to get to the world.</p>
<p>And when I&rsquo;m in my way, if God has set something on me,</p>
<p>when I&rsquo;m in my way, I&rsquo;m in God&rsquo;s way.</p>
<p>Now I can point at other people and say,</p>
<p>hey, you guys are in God&rsquo;s way</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re not listening to me.</p>
<p>But if I&rsquo;m in my way, I&rsquo;m not listening to God.</p>
<p>And for me to be a philosopher and a leader</p>
<p>or whatever other language, I have to listen to God.</p>
<p>So before God, what I will do is start off as a samurai</p>
<p>and say, I&rsquo;m sorry for hurting you as a Jewish person.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry for the way that made you feel.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m sorry for the entire population of a race</p>
<p>that I feel is actually my brothers</p>
<p>because I classify and feel that I&rsquo;m also connected</p>
<p>with Christ in that way,</p>
<p>that my people came from Africa in that way.</p>
<p>And I can&rsquo;t say it&rsquo;s this exact teaching</p>
<p>or that exact teaching,</p>
<p>but I feel that there&rsquo;s an important,</p>
<p>the sons of Abraham, however we wanna word it,</p>
<p>for us to come together and bring our different talents</p>
<p>together to serve God collectively.</p>
<p>And he, as much of an alien as I am,</p>
<p>he does not cause me, he did not call for me to alienate.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what the problem has been,</p>
<p>especially in politics and in America.</p>
<p>He placed America as the TV, as the radio to the world.</p>
<p>We invented rock and roll.</p>
<p>We are the influencers of the rest of the planet.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re the youngest startup in history, right?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re the youngest country,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re the youngest superpower, right?</p>
<p>So for me and my position,</p>
<p>the fact that I can talk to Trump one day</p>
<p>and be at a game with Kim Kardashian the next day</p>
<p>and then be at Paris Fashion Week,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t want me to be involved with language</p>
<p>of decisive, divisive language,</p>
<p>proving that I can be just as racist</p>
<p>as a racist white person.</p>
<p>Oh, I can be a racist black person also.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not what God has called me to do.</p>
<p>So how do I simplify and say, hey, to you,</p>
<p>as a visionary, as an engineer,</p>
<p>as a person that&rsquo;s given me a platform,</p>
<p>that as my brother, I wanna apologize to you</p>
<p>for how that made you feel,</p>
<p>and to the rest of the people</p>
<p>that carry specifically that pain,</p>
<p>not the pain that I talk about</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t seem to be as much of a pain for people</p>
<p>when I talk about the abortion clinics and stuff.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s like, that&rsquo;s an argued pain</p>
<p>even in my own community.</p>
<p>Like not everyone thinks that&rsquo;s a pain,</p>
<p>but for the Jewish community,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s collectively this was a pain.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve gone so far just psychologically</p>
<p>on this journey since that statement had happened,</p>
<p>where I didn&rsquo;t want to like give up the candy in my pocket.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t want to say, hey, I stuck my hand in a candy jar.</p>
<p>I wanted to defend my freedom of speech.</p>
<p>I wanted this.</p>
<p>But even with freedom of speech, pain is pain.</p>
<p>Causing people to hurt is not helping.</p>
<p>Causing people to hurt is not helping.</p>
<p>So that means I have to take a more sophisticated approach</p>
<p>to engineering this problem.</p>
<p>This problem is the opportunity.</p>
<p>And yes, that what could, some people may deem as a mistake.</p>
<p>Would it be more genuine if I called it a mistake?</p>
<p>I think I would be hypocritical by calling it a mistake</p>
<p>with the ending of that, the idea I&rsquo;m gonna say out loud.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not, I don&rsquo;t try to be a hypocrite on purpose.</p>
<p>So, but I will call it a mistake to add a genuine,</p>
<p>to be genuine about the feeling.</p>
<p>With that mistake,</p>
<p>with me as a human being, not to justify,</p>
<p>but I have to state that God makes no mistakes</p>
<p>because if I hadn&rsquo;t made that mistake,</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t be in front of you today.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not to justify this,</p>
<p>sleepy text.</p>
<p>But I can tell you&rsquo;re a man that has love in his heart.</p>
<p>And I hear that, I hear it through the words</p>
<p>explicitly and implicitly.</p>
<p>And I think if we were to engineer a better future,</p>
<p>the way to do that is with love.</p>
<p>So as one human to another, I love you, brother.</p>
<p>Thank you for talking today.</p>
<p>This was great.</p>
<p>I like you too.</p>
<p>Son of a bitch.</p>
<p>Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation with Ye,</p>
