    <p>Okay, listener, it&rsquo;s time for bonus content. And we asked you guys to send us DMS to our</p>
<p>Instagram and they have been coming in. So each Thursday, we&rsquo;re going to pick the producer</p>
<p>Kylie is going to pick two or three DMS. Okay. And she&rsquo;s going to play them for us. Okay.</p>
<p>And then we&rsquo;re going to free ball it. So have you heard him before? No. Okay. I&rsquo;m lying.</p>
<p>I have. We&rsquo;d just like to keep it secret from you. Okay. All right. But also, listener,</p>
<p>we really we need you guys to rate what else pumps review and subscribe. That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>And follow. Oh, follow. Yes. Yeah. And then apparently, our new producer that&rsquo;s joined</p>
<p>the team, Kylie, who joined Jen and Nellie, she knows how to get people wound up on TikTok.</p>
<p>I know. And so they&rsquo;re going crazy over on TikTok about the baby talk. I&rsquo;m shocked that</p>
<p>anyone would admit that they baby talked much less defend it. So on TikTok, the majority</p>
<p>of these listeners are pissed at us, right? They&rsquo;re pissed off. And they are the baby</p>
<p>talk defenders. Yeah. Of all the things you&rsquo;ve said, this is the one that is really getting</p>
<p>under their skin. I&rsquo;m shocked. We&rsquo;ve said so many offensive things and they&rsquo;re pissed</p>
<p>off that we don&rsquo;t like the baby talkers. It&rsquo;s not even offensive. And here&rsquo;s the deal. I</p>
<p>love it. I remain steadfast. Oh, in our commitment. Put a sock in the baby talk. Okay, let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>hear our first. I&rsquo;ve had it. Damn. Okay, this one is from Kami. Oh, okay. Cameo cameo. The</p>
<p>thing I&rsquo;ve had it with is women, pregnant women holding their bellies in pictures. I</p>
<p>mean, come on. Nobody cares. You&rsquo;re not the first to be pregnant. Get over it. Nobody</p>
<p>gives a shit. It drives me to drink. I fucking love her. Love cameo. I mean, that&rsquo;s the best</p>
<p>cameo. Okay. I totally agree with you. 100% agree. 100% agree with you. It is people making</p>
<p>such a big deal out of being pregnant, when literally half of the population and half of</p>
<p>all species can do so and do so. And this kind of segues into the breastfeeders, right? Which</p>
<p>if you really want to go do like a deep dive on Instagram, you can Instagram the hashtag,</p>
<p>breast is best. And you would not believe I mean, these people act like they discovered</p>
<p>breastfeeding. And I&rsquo;m like, listen up buttercup. All the mammals do it. Like it&rsquo;s not new.</p>
<p>No, let me tell you a story. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever told you. When I was a lifeguard</p>
<p>in college, I would pump the brakes. Okay. You were a lifeguard? Yes. And a water safety</p>
<p>instructor. I taught swimming lessons. Shut up, you would be such a terrible lifeguard. How did</p>
<p>I not know this? After? Yes, I totally I was really good. Why would you think I&rsquo;d be terrible?</p>
<p>Number one, I&rsquo;ve gone swimming with you and you&rsquo;re a terrible swimmer.</p>
<p>That is such a lie. I was such a good lifeguard. Did you save a life? One time I had to jump in.</p>
<p>But okay, that&rsquo;s not we digress. Okay, go on. The story is I&rsquo;m sitting because you only do 15</p>
<p>minutes at a time. So that was good for my ADD. You&rsquo;re up for 15, then you switch 15. Okay.</p>
<p>So this woman is at the pool, and there&rsquo;s a kid like eight years old, eight, nine, like eating.</p>
<p>He has Doritos. I will never forget it. I know where this is going. He has Doritos,</p>
<p>a bag of Doritos in his hand. Yeah. Walks up, rips his mother&rsquo;s bathing suit down and starts</p>
<p>sucking on her boob. I was so grossed out. I thought I was going to die. I mean, I was like,</p>
<p>literally, I couldn&rsquo;t sleep that night. It was so gross. Did you ever watch Game of Thrones?</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t get into it. You know that. And tell the listener why.</p>
<p>Because I can&rsquo;t understand what they&rsquo;re saying. You know, they speak English. I know,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a weird English. So I have trouble following and all the people look alike.</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s a there&rsquo;s a kind of this woman and she has a son that&rsquo;s around eight or nine,</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s always breastfeeding him. See, that creeps me out. Yeah,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really creepy. If you can chew a Dorito, you can drink regular milk. It&rsquo;s time to wean.</p>
<p>Wean off. Wean from the tit. So anyway, okay. Had it. Had it. Cameo, we have had it as well.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a 10 out of 10. 10 out of 10. Who&rsquo;s next? We&rsquo;ve got Shara W. Shara W.</p>
<p>All right. This is what I&rsquo;ve had it with. People that make comments on post such as</p>
<p>someone puts their dog that they have lost. Has anyone seen our dog? And then one after another,</p>
<p>people commenting. Nope. Nope. Hadn&rsquo;t seen it. Hadn&rsquo;t seen it. And then they make that person</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s already grieving. Every time their phone dings, they look at the comment and it says,</p>
<p>nope. Just tell them when you freaking found the dog or you have spotted the dog somewhere.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had it. You know, that goes right into our group texting issue. There&rsquo;s no reason to comment</p>
<p>no. We&rsquo;re going to it&rsquo;s rhetorical unless you&rsquo;ve seen the dog. A hundred percent. Yes, I agree.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s just a fundamental problem. Facebook. You got all these wound up boomers on there,</p>
<p>you know, that literally it&rsquo;s like bright, shiny object and they have like keyboard courage,</p>
<p>you know, and they&rsquo;re just going bananas on Facebook. I got this guy that I&rsquo;m Facebook</p>
<p>friends with and he&rsquo;s post just, I mean, he&rsquo;s probably 65. His name&rsquo;s Dan. Okay. He lives in</p>
<p>Edmond, Oklahoma, which is suburban Oklahoma listener. And like every 4th of July, he gears up</p>
<p>and he goes, I love America. I love everything it stands for. And if you don&rsquo;t like it,</p>
<p>you can get the fuck out. I&rsquo;m like, well, okay, Dan, Dan just out here kicking people out of</p>
<p>the country from his Facebook headquarters in Edmond, Oklahoma. And it&rsquo;s just like,</p>
<p>Dan, pull yourself together. I mean, seriously, nobody is going to leave the country</p>
<p>because of your post. It&rsquo;s unbelievable. But, but I know what, what was her name again?</p>
<p>I know what she&rsquo;s saying because it&rsquo;s like a dagger and then it&rsquo;s just a twist. Nope,</p>
<p>nope, nope, nope. I love it. That&rsquo;s a great one. I would have never thought of that,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s a great one. It is a really good one. You ready for your next? Yeah. Let&rsquo;s hear our</p>
<p>next. This is one of my favorites. Oh, good. This is from Jill B. Jill B. I&rsquo;ve had it with</p>
<p>worrying about seeing the new wife at my daughter&rsquo;s wedding this fall.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s a tough one, Jill B. That is a tough one. Here&rsquo;s the deal. You&rsquo;ve got to make</p>
<p>sure that you look better no matter what, if you have to go get Botox, a new outfit, you have to</p>
<p>look so good just so she doesn&rsquo;t have anything over on you. I really empathize with you though,</p>
<p>Jill, because it&rsquo;s like, that&rsquo;s your daughter with that man. And then he&rsquo;s got to waltz in</p>
<p>with the new wife and, and you&rsquo;re going to be inhibited enjoying your own daughter&rsquo;s wedding</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re worried about seeing her. And I really empathize with that. Yeah. That&rsquo;s a tough,</p>
<p>tough spot. You know, you&rsquo;re constantly still dealing with the person with whom you chose</p>
<p>to breed. Right. If you get divorced, no kids, then it&rsquo;s done. You don&rsquo;t ever have to see him</p>
<p>again. But the baby. Yeah. Once you have a baby with him, that&rsquo;s it. I remember one time we were</p>
<p>on a trip with the kids when we were both married. And I said to you, I would fucking divorce his</p>
<p>ass tomorrow, except someday his new wife is going to be prancing around with my kids on the</p>
<p>beach on vacation. And it&rsquo;s going to piss me off. Do you remember that? Yeah. I mean, I was just</p>
<p>like infuriated that the thought that the new wife would get my kids on vacation. Yeah. So yeah.</p>
<p>Sharing. I mean, that&rsquo;s hard to share, especially like your daughter&rsquo;s wedding, where you want it</p>
<p>to be perfect for her. So you don&rsquo;t want to bitch, but you know, the husband&rsquo;s probably like,</p>
<p>make sure you include Marianne in all the staff. Yeah. Don&rsquo;t you think? Oh my God, I just baby</p>
<p>talked. How do you feel? How would you, how do you, you have a daughter, right? So let&rsquo;s say</p>
<p>that your ex shows up with some hot number to the wedding. How do you feel about that?</p>
<p>I would say, good luck, princess. You can have it. Take it. It&rsquo;s all yours.</p>
<p>Take him around the block. Take him around the block and keep him forever.</p>
<p>All right. Who else do we have? Our last one is from Lisa B. Okay.</p>
<p>I have had it with people that get offended at every little thing that you say.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter what it is. They&rsquo;re always getting their feelings heard, getting offended.</p>
<p>Just for once, I wish that somebody that had a chip on their shoulder, it would be a Pringle.</p>
<p>And I just eat that thing up.</p>
<p>I do think that people get way overly offended these days. I do too. And I think most people</p>
<p>think stuff&rsquo;s about them and it&rsquo;s generally almost never about them. I think one reason</p>
<p>that our friendship has worked so well is that we&rsquo;re both so thick skinned. Right. Not sensitive</p>
<p>at all. At all. I mean, we&rsquo;re both incredibly thick skin and I tend to surround myself with</p>
<p>people that are thick skinned. And so when I&rsquo;m around somebody who&rsquo;s really thin skinned-</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m horrible at it. I have to babysit their emotions and they think I&rsquo;m mad at them or</p>
<p>they think I&rsquo;m offended just because I&rsquo;m a very, whatever I feel, I just say it. Whatever I think,</p>
<p>I just say it. And so when I have to walk around on eggshells, I am not operating at my best.</p>
<p>No, I agree a hundred percent. And I think probably we&rsquo;re too far on the other end of</p>
<p>the spectrum. It takes a whole lot for me to get offended or have my feelings hurt. I can&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>imagine what it would be. I think there&rsquo;s a happy medium. We&rsquo;re probably too far on that. But yeah,</p>
<p>I think the selective outrage is a little over the top. And I do. I think you&rsquo;ve tapped into</p>
<p>something. I do think it&rsquo;s selective outrage. And there&rsquo;s so much typical hypocrisy. People</p>
<p>that get offended easily all the time. It&rsquo;s a very cherry picked offenses. I mean, where they</p>
<p>get offended. Like I, when people are so overtly sensitive, I almost get mad. I do. I&rsquo;m just like,</p>
<p>quit being a pussy, pull yourself together. Nobody else is mad. And then you have to kind</p>
<p>of babysit the emotions. I do not. I am not very good. No, I&rsquo;m not good at that at all.</p>
<p>Okay. I just have to circle back to this lifeguard situation.</p>
<p>I was a great, I taught like two to like 10 swimming lessons.</p>
<p>I, I want to, I&rsquo;ve never seen you properly swim before.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a really good swimmer.</p>
<p>I remember you doing like jazzercise at our last Mexico trip, like some kind of water aerobics with</p>
<p>your vape hanging out of your mouth, but like actually swimming like laps.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, I could do it. We&rsquo;ll go to the pool.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just going to tell you, listener, you could blow me over with a fucking feather. I&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>friends with this woman for 20 years. I&rsquo;ll be in a phone call with her. She&rsquo;s talk, talk,</p>
<p>talking. And then all of a sudden I hear this dramatic crash. She&rsquo;s tripped over something</p>
<p>in her house. She&rsquo;s screaming. I don&rsquo;t know. Should I hang up? Call 911? Do I stay on the</p>
<p>phone? Did somebody, is there a home intruder? She just simply tripped over absolutely nothing.</p>
<p>The fact that you were in charge of an entire swimming pool.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve, I&rsquo;ve been to Mexico with you multiple times. I&rsquo;ve swam with you multiple times.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve never struck me as a swimmer. I would never think that you could save my life.</p>
<p>I would never think that you could save my children&rsquo;s lives if they were in a pool.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been in situations where our children have been injured. You were the least helpful person</p>
<p>in the room. Hands down. I have had to go apply pressure to your bleeding children and put</p>
<p>band-aids on them multiple times. I almost pass out at the sight of blood. That&rsquo;s how useless</p>
<p>you were. So this is a huge reveal in our friendship. We&rsquo;re going to go up to the club</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m going to do laps. I can do it all. I can do the breaststroke, the backstroke,</p>
<p>the butterfly. I mean, I&rsquo;m just grace under fire. Well, I&rsquo;ll tell you what else we&rsquo;re going to do.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to throw myself in there and I&rsquo;m going to start drowning.</p>
<p>And then we&rsquo;re going to see if you can save me. Okay. The question will be, do I want to save you?</p>
<p>All right, everybody. Thanks for tuning in to our bonus episode. Please DM at I&rsquo;ve had it</p>
<p>podcast things that you&rsquo;ve had it with so that you can make one of our bonus episodes. We love</p>
<p>to hear this shit. We can&rsquo;t get enough of it. It&rsquo;s fantastic. Send them in. See you next Tuesday.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had it with that. I&rsquo;ve had it. Had it. Had it. Had it. All I can say about that is I&rsquo;ve had it.</p>
