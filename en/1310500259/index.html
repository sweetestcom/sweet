    <p>The following is a conversation with Mark Normand,</p>
<p>a New York comedian who has a way with words</p>
<p>that is often both dark and hilarious.</p>
<p>Let there be a warning, dear friends,</p>
<p>to proceed with caution and to wear protection.</p>
<p>You may, in fact, need it.</p>
<p>He has a special on his YouTube called Out to Lunch</p>
<p>and a new special on Netflix</p>
<p>as part of the standup season three series</p>
<p>I recommend you watch.</p>
<p>This is the Lex Friedman podcast.</p>
<p>To support it, please check out our sponsors</p>
<p>in the description.</p>
<p>And now, here&rsquo;s my conversation with Mark Normand.</p>
<p>I asked Tim Dillon about Bukowski first,</p>
<p>so let me continue on that tradition</p>
<p>and ask you about something</p>
<p>that Charles Bukowski said about love.</p>
<p>Wait, are we rolling?</p>
<p>Yes. Oh, geez.</p>
<p>No hello, no nothing.</p>
<p>Nope. I thought I was robotic.</p>
<p>Bukowski said, love is a fog that burns away</p>
<p>with the first daylight of reality.</p>
<p>So Mark Normand, let me first ask you about love.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts about love?</p>
<p>You talk about your relationships quite a bit.</p>
<p>Do you think love can last?</p>
<p>I do, but I think it&rsquo;s work.</p>
<p>Everybody wants love to be this prepackaged,</p>
<p>perfect euphoric thing, but you gotta,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like a good body, you know?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re all born with a good body,</p>
<p>but you gotta keep it in shape.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s the same with a loving relationship.</p>
<p>I think you.</p>
<p>Nobody wants to do the work, that&rsquo;s the problem.</p>
<p>You talked about, I think you told a story</p>
<p>about being unfaithful to a previous girlfriend</p>
<p>or something like that.</p>
<p>I think the story goes that you were like drifting apart.</p>
<p>Who were you talking to?</p>
<p>Burt Kreischer maybe or something like that?</p>
<p>Oh yeah, we were high school sweethearts,</p>
<p>dated for like 12 years and then.</p>
<p>So that wasn&rsquo;t love anymore.</p>
<p>That was more like relationship, that was like.</p>
<p>It was comfort, it was routine.</p>
<p>And we just slipped into that married life autopilot world.</p>
<p>And I tried to break up, I think, and it didn&rsquo;t take.</p>
<p>It was one of those things.</p>
<p>Our lives are just so baked in.</p>
<p>And then I think I cheated and she caught me</p>
<p>and it was ugly.</p>
<p>And then we went to therapy to try to work it out,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s much like a car that gets into a wreck.</p>
<p>The door just never closed the same.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>Yeah, so what are your thoughts about then commitment</p>
<p>like outside of love marriage?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s an antiquated idea.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s kind of silly and unrealistic.</p>
<p>And I think we&rsquo;re coming out of that</p>
<p>as we get all polyamorous and non binary</p>
<p>and queefy and all this stuff.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re slowly moving away from that.</p>
<p>But I think a lot of the ladies,</p>
<p>more majority women like marriage, like the idea of it.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m a fiance now or whatever you call it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m engaged.</p>
<p>And I mean, she is just woo wee going hog wild.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s loving it.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s got the dress thing, pick a venue flower</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s deep in whereas I feel guilty</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m just like, ah, geez.</p>
<p>Is it planned already?</p>
<p>When&rsquo;s the wedding?</p>
<p>You see Squid Game, I&rsquo;m just living life.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s planned.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s in New Orleans.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m from there and it&rsquo;s next year.</p>
<p>Are you married?</p>
<p>No, single.</p>
<p>Virgin?</p>
<p>Of course, yeah.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t imagine.</p>
<p>I bet you&rsquo;d be great in bed.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re ripped.</p>
<p>Best hairline in podcasting.</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t tried yet.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ll have to see.</p>
<p>All right, well, let me know.</p>
<p>Pretty big hog on you?</p>
<p>Yeah, I could see you packing a crazy, crazy tool downtown.</p>
<p>That matters to girls?</p>
<p>Apparently, yeah, that&rsquo;s all I hear about.</p>
<p>Okay, New Orleans.</p>
<p>You grew up in New Orleans?</p>
<p>Yeah, born and raised.</p>
<p>Treme outside the French Quarter.</p>
<p>Have you ever been?</p>
<p>Yeah, don&rsquo;t remember it.</p>
<p>Oh, you drink?</p>
<p>Yeah, I drink.</p>
<p>Of course I drink.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, I can&rsquo;t tell if you have fun.</p>
<p>No, not really.</p>
<p>But in Russia, of course I drink vodka,</p>
<p>all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Oh, right, in Russia.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Gotta know.</p>
<p>Vodka.</p>
<p>Beer was just labeled an alcoholic beverage in 2011.</p>
<p>Fun fact.</p>
<p>What do you mean?</p>
<p>In Russia.</p>
<p>It was just drinks.</p>
<p>It was just like apple juice before.</p>
<p>It finally got declared legally as an alcoholic beverage.</p>
<p>Which means you can regulate it, that kind of thing.</p>
<p>I guess so.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>See, that&rsquo;s where your brain goes.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>I just go, oh, these fucking Ruskies are.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t even know there was rules about drinking.</p>
<p>This is good, I&rsquo;m learning about Russia from you.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the difficult memory, experience from childhood</p>
<p>in New Orleans that made you the man you are today?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it made me the man,</p>
<p>but jeez, I had a lot of scuffles in the neighborhood.</p>
<p>I was the white kid in the neighborhood.</p>
<p>So I was automatically the odd man out, the minority,</p>
<p>the weirdo, the dork, the dweeb, the honky.</p>
<p>So just a lot of memories of like getting slapped</p>
<p>in the face by guys and just having to take it</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s like five guys there.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;d be like, oh, look, you didn&rsquo;t even fight back.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re like, what am I going to do?</p>
<p>Hit you and then get beat up by these guys?</p>
<p>So a lot of that stuff was a big bummer growing up.</p>
<p>Got robbed all the time, lost a lot of bicycles,</p>
<p>had a bicycle taken from under me, that was pretty brutal.</p>
<p>These kids pulled up, you know, they&rsquo;re like 17</p>
<p>and I was 13 and I had a face paint on.</p>
<p>Like I had a, not black face, but I was at a summer camp</p>
<p>and I had a rainbow face painted on me.</p>
<p>We were helping kids that day.</p>
<p>So I let them put paint on me.</p>
<p>And so now I&rsquo;m riding home.</p>
<p>What a mark, what a goober I am.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m riding home and these guys see me a mile away.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a sitting duck and they go, we can take his bike.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s got a fucking rainbow on his cheek.</p>
<p>So they just go, hey, you know, like cut in front of you.</p>
<p>They go, let me try your bike.</p>
<p>I go, I&rsquo;m good, I&rsquo;m good.</p>
<p>I knew what they wanted.</p>
<p>And they go, let me try the bike.</p>
<p>And then they just pushed me and took the bike.</p>
<p>So stuff like that was really shaping the insecurity,</p>
<p>the self worth.</p>
<p>Did it, cause I&rsquo;ve been mugged when I was younger too.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>Yeah, it changes your view of human nature a little bit.</p>
<p>For sure.</p>
<p>You go, wow, I didn&rsquo;t know people could be this mean.</p>
<p>This cool.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Inconsiderate.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m always worried about it.</p>
<p>Did I fart too much?</p>
<p>Am I annoying?</p>
<p>Am I pissing this guy off?</p>
<p>But what a way to live.</p>
<p>Just, I want the bike, I&rsquo;m taking it.</p>
<p>Fuck his feelings.</p>
<p>For me, that quickly turned into realizing</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s just a temporary phase that those folks are in.</p>
<p>Like they have a capacity to be good.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>For some reason, for me, that was a motivation to see,</p>
<p>can we discover, can we incentivize them</p>
<p>to find like a better path in life?</p>
<p>Like I wasn&rsquo;t like all like, I don&rsquo;t know, Gandhi about it.</p>
<p>Of course I was pissed and all those kinds of things,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t know, it seemed like just the kind of thing</p>
<p>you might do when you&rsquo;re younger.</p>
<p>You hope.</p>
<p>But this is adult crime, obviously.</p>
<p>Yeah, I know, but yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>And then it solidifies and then you&rsquo;re beyond saving</p>
<p>at some point, but it&rsquo;s like, there&rsquo;s always,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s always an opportunity to make a better life</p>
<p>for yourself, to become a better version of yourself.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I remember coming home crying with no bike</p>
<p>and my mom, my parents are like liberal to a fault.</p>
<p>You know, where they were like, oh, well they need it.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re poor kids in the neighborhood.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re like, all right, but I also like have a bicycle</p>
<p>that I ride around, you know, and I also like to live</p>
<p>in an area that&rsquo;s not just, you know, riddled with theft</p>
<p>and vandalism, but they were just like, oh, they need it.</p>
<p>And then it was a moot point, we just moved on.</p>
<p>So I remember very young being like, all right,</p>
<p>I gotta figure my shit out.</p>
<p>Okay, so you said you were beat up quite a bit,</p>
<p>like bullying and stuff.</p>
<p>Pushed around, I was never hospitalized or anything,</p>
<p>but you know, you get a black guy here and there</p>
<p>and a bloody nose, stuff like that.</p>
<p>And it was just the outnumbered thing.</p>
<p>The violence didn&rsquo;t really bother me</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re just kids, you&rsquo;re boys.</p>
<p>But it was the predatory, let&rsquo;s get him.</p>
<p>You know, we can take him down.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s, you know, he&rsquo;s an easy target.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what kills you, the mental part.</p>
<p>Yeah, you know, until you actually said I didn&rsquo;t realize,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been in, what do you call them, scuffles.</p>
<p>And there was just one that stands out to me where, yeah.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s hear it, Faddy, bring it on.</p>
<p>And you do jujitsu and all that stuff, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, I can see the guns through the suit,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re like John Wick.</p>
<p>All right, well, I used to have,</p>
<p>now you&rsquo;re gonna start making fun of me,</p>
<p>I used to have long hair for like a couple of years.</p>
<p>I was in a band playing music and stuff like that.</p>
<p>And there was, like most of the fights I&rsquo;ve been in</p>
<p>were basically one on one, maybe a little bit like,</p>
<p>a little extra stuff, but not outnumbered.</p>
<p>And this one particular time,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve learned a lot of lessons,</p>
<p>but one of them was, there was a fight started</p>
<p>between me and this other person.</p>
<p>And then his buddies, I guess, were there.</p>
<p>And they, as opposed to like breaking it up</p>
<p>or letting it happen, one of them grabbed my hair.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the first time anybody grabbed,</p>
<p>like used my hair in a fight,</p>
<p>which I haven&rsquo;t since then realized that that&rsquo;s actually</p>
<p>a really powerful grip and a powerful weapon.</p>
<p>Oh, very vulnerable of you.</p>
<p>And then my head got pulled back</p>
<p>and they pulled me down to the ground.</p>
<p>Like I couldn&rsquo;t do anything, it was so,</p>
<p>I remember being exceptionally frustrated.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>That was the feeling like, I can&rsquo;t do anything here.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like trapped.</p>
<p>And then they were just like kicking me and hitting me</p>
<p>and stuff like that.</p>
<p>And the outnumbered part of it,</p>
<p>because I always kind of remember the trapped part</p>
<p>because I just hated from a fighting grappling perspective,</p>
<p>how like, the feeling was this isn&rsquo;t fair.</p>
<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s what it is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a deep, deep unfairness that you just can&rsquo;t win.</p>
<p>The mob wins.</p>
<p>Yeah, the mob wins.</p>
<p>Scary stuff.</p>
<p>But it makes a man out of you in a weird way</p>
<p>that builds character, you realize life isn&rsquo;t fair early</p>
<p>and you go on from there.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s something there.</p>
<p>And look at you today.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re probably eating out of a dumpster</p>
<p>at a Krispy Kreme and you&rsquo;re here,</p>
<p>got eight podcasts, you&rsquo;re doing great,</p>
<p>talking to giant titans of the industry.</p>
<p>No, I do remember returning home that night.</p>
<p>I mean that you said you were crying.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really formative.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s the point in which you get to decide</p>
<p>what do I make of this moment?</p>
<p>I mean, especially when you&rsquo;re younger,</p>
<p>maybe it&rsquo;s not presented to you that way,</p>
<p>but like some of the greatest people in history</p>
<p>were bullied in these kinds of ways.</p>
<p>And they made something of themselves in this moment,</p>
<p>like bullied by life in some kind of way.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like an opportunity for growth.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s weird, but like hardship even in small doses</p>
<p>is like an opportunity for growth.</p>
<p>Totally, I mean, look at Richard Pryor.</p>
<p>They say he&rsquo;s labeled as the best comedian of all time.</p>
<p>Grew up in a whorehouse,</p>
<p>watch his mom get plowed by these guys</p>
<p>in the middle of Indiana, I wanna say.</p>
<p>And just who had a harder life?</p>
<p>He would suck dick for drugs,</p>
<p>all this stuff growing up, beat up.</p>
<p>And then the weird thing is, oops, sorry,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s my birth control alarm.</p>
<p>And then the whole world is like trying</p>
<p>to get rid of bullying, but we still do bullying,</p>
<p>but now it&rsquo;s accepted bullying.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very strange.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re a proponent of beating kids up,</p>
<p>is that what you&rsquo;re saying?</p>
<p>Yes, and sex with them.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>But no, I just think it&rsquo;s part of life</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s horrible, it&rsquo;s like rain, you gotta have it.</p>
<p>Look, a rainy day is a bummer, but you need it.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s similar to that.</p>
<p>What was your relationship like with your mom, your dad?</p>
<p>What are some memorable moments with them?</p>
<p>What did you learn from them?</p>
<p>Good parents, they&rsquo;re giving, thoughtful.</p>
<p>A little out to lunch, they were workaholics,</p>
<p>so it was hard to get a lot out of them.</p>
<p>And my dad was kind of an angry dad.</p>
<p>I think he just had like a weird childhood</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s just trying to make it</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s trying to provide, but it&rsquo;s hard.</p>
<p>And we live in this horrible neighborhood</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re getting robbed all the time.</p>
<p>So life was kind of coming down on him all the time.</p>
<p>So then he&rsquo;ll take it out on you or whoever, he would snap.</p>
<p>But great parents, they cared, they put us first,</p>
<p>but there wasn&rsquo;t a lot of, you ever go to a friend&rsquo;s house</p>
<p>as a kid and there&rsquo;s like a picture of a ski trip</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re like, ski trip?</p>
<p>What the hell is that about?</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t a lot of that and smart, very smart people,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t know how well they were at socializing.</p>
<p>So you never like bonded with them</p>
<p>like on a deep human level?</p>
<p>Some bonding, but rarely deep.</p>
<p>Yeah, it was just almost coworker.</p>
<p>Hey, cold out, huh?</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s cold out, huh?</p>
<p>Oh yeah, like that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, I got you.</p>
<p>Get there a little bit, but my parents are done.</p>
<p>I hope they never saw this, but they would do a thing</p>
<p>where my dad especially would do a thing</p>
<p>where he would, he knew how to cut you down</p>
<p>right to the bone and so after a while you&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not even gonna interact with this guy</p>
<p>because he can get you so well.</p>
<p>One time we were at like a Thanksgiving,</p>
<p>some kind of family event and all the cousins are there</p>
<p>and I remember I was holding court.</p>
<p>I was a young boy finding my comedic legs</p>
<p>in this weird tumultuous sea we call a family</p>
<p>and I was killing and my dad comes out and he goes,</p>
<p>what are you holding court?</p>
<p>And I was like, ah, and I felt like I was this big.</p>
<p>I just whoo, shrunk down.</p>
<p>He just nailed it because in my head I&rsquo;m like,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m holding court, look at me, I got the whole room</p>
<p>and he goes, what are you, what are you holding court here?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, who the hell do you think you are?</p>
<p>And I was like, he&rsquo;s right, I shouldn&rsquo;t be holding court,</p>
<p>who the fuck am I, I&rsquo;m nobody.</p>
<p>So stuff like that.</p>
<p>Was he aware of that you think?</p>
<p>He wasn&rsquo;t, he wasn&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t think he was, but.</p>
<p>Do you give parents a pass when they&rsquo;re unaware</p>
<p>of the destructive, like is it better when they&rsquo;re unaware?</p>
<p>Because it seems like that&rsquo;s the way.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the way parents often fail</p>
<p>is they&rsquo;re not intentionally malevolent,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re just like clueless.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s a bittersweet thing</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re like, well, okay, he&rsquo;s not malicious,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s not trying to hurt me,</p>
<p>but also he doesn&rsquo;t know he hurt me.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, it&rsquo;s tough</p>
<p>because if he was trying to hurt you,</p>
<p>I guess that would be worse.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re the fully baked Mark Norman cake at this point</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s a shitty cake.</p>
<p>Fruit salad.</p>
<p>You know, the sense of self worth you mentioned.</p>
<p>I think in your comedy,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a sense like you hate yourself.</p>
<p>You think?</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know if that came through.</p>
<p>Shit, I was trying to hide that part.</p>
<p>God damn it.</p>
<p>I mean, when you like in the privacy of your own mind,</p>
<p>are you able to love yourself or is it mostly self hate?</p>
<p>Jeez, what happened to this podcast?</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know I was on Dr. Phil.</p>
<p>Dr. Phil.</p>
<p>I thought we were gonna talk about engineering</p>
<p>and climate change and rockets.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll get there.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Starts with love, goes to rockets.</p>
<p>All right, I like that.</p>
<p>I like that&rsquo;s a t shirt.</p>
<p>I mean, like.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the question?</p>
<p>Sorry.</p>
<p>Do I feel love?</p>
<p>No, no, like.</p>
<p>Do I love myself?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, so are you like this engine</p>
<p>of being self critical</p>
<p>of just being constantly anxious</p>
<p>about how the world perceives you, these kinds of things?</p>
<p>Is this something that you just go to for comedy</p>
<p>or is this who you are as a human being?</p>
<p>I think I don&rsquo;t wanna explore it.</p>
<p>I think I get around it.</p>
<p>You know, I tap dance around it,</p>
<p>but I get it out a little with my act maybe,</p>
<p>because I can&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not doing it in real life.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll get out this no love, not loving myself.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know who wants to love themself.</p>
<p>Everybody always like you gotta love yourself.</p>
<p>And then when you meet somebody who does love yourself,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re like, I fucking hate this guy.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t you hate the guy who&rsquo;s upset?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m great, I&rsquo;m awesome.</p>
<p>Life is good.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like, ah, this guy sucks.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d rather an insecure guy.</p>
<p>So maybe I wanna stay insecure.</p>
<p>Maybe I don&rsquo;t wanna find this love for myself.</p>
<p>Well, okay.</p>
<p>So self love, like just appreciating who you are,</p>
<p>or like appreciating the moment of being grateful</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t have to express itself</p>
<p>by the guy saying I&rsquo;m awesome.</p>
<p>True.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more just like humility.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like walking calmly through the world</p>
<p>and just being grateful to be alive,</p>
<p>that kind of thing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>And like, oh, being appreciative</p>
<p>of all the accomplishments you&rsquo;ve made so far.</p>
<p>I say all this because mostly I&rsquo;m extremely self critical</p>
<p>in everything I do.</p>
<p>And so, and I kind of enjoy it.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a nice little engine that it makes it fun.</p>
<p>It makes life fun,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s like if you hate everything you do,</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;ve done in the past,</p>
<p>that gives you like, all right, we can do better.</p>
<p>Yes, but that&rsquo;s the key is making yourself critical.</p>
<p>Always trying to get better.</p>
<p>I could change this, I could tweak this,</p>
<p>I could improve this.</p>
<p>When you just go, I hate that I do this, I suck,</p>
<p>you just shut down.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the key is always being productive</p>
<p>with the criticism.</p>
<p>Yeah, and the basics of life,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just like grateful for it, to be alive.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s nice to be coupled that with self criticism.</p>
<p>Two legs, again, the hairline, the hog,</p>
<p>the muscles, the world.</p>
<p>You got a good brain on you.</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;re lucky.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re in the top,</p>
<p>most people are fat as shit at Burger King right now,</p>
<p>hitting their kids.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re in a Ramada hotel,</p>
<p>sitting with a low level comedian.</p>
<p>For the record, I ate McDonald&rsquo;s last night.</p>
<p>Oh, all right, well, you&rsquo;re human.</p>
<p>Well, just so you know, this is not me defending,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sponsored by McDonald&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>but I mostly eat meat,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with the beef they have.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually one of the easiest ways late at night.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s worse.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s actually cow.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually rats.</p>
<p>Yeah, you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>But hey, it&rsquo;s just meat.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a meat guy myself.</p>
<p>They say in 20 years, we&rsquo;re gonna look back</p>
<p>and go, can you believe people ate meat?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna look like somebody like slavery.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s some ethical,</p>
<p>difficult things with factory farming.</p>
<p>Yeah, so let&rsquo;s ride it out now while we still got it.</p>
<p>And now it&rsquo;s on record.</p>
<p>Tom Waits says something about New York.</p>
<p>You like Tom Waits?</p>
<p>I think he&rsquo;s underrated.</p>
<p>I think he&rsquo;s got great,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s got a great, he&rsquo;s great at quips and quotes.</p>
<p>Check him out on YouTube.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s got some montages and super cuts</p>
<p>of him being hilarious.</p>
<p>What does he say about,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d rather have a bottle in front of me</p>
<p>than a frontal lobotomy.</p>
<p>That was the one.</p>
<p>That was the one that sold me.</p>
<p>I was like, this guy&rsquo;s awesome.</p>
<p>Yeah, but his music,</p>
<p>cause he&rsquo;s just a genius musician.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Anyway, he was talking about New York.</p>
<p>I was walking around, I&rsquo;m in New York right now.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re in New York right now.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s still a magical city to me.</p>
<p>A lot of people are quite cynical about it,</p>
<p>about the state of things, but.</p>
<p>Go again.</p>
<p>Not like Michael Malice, like a lot of friends of mine,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re just a lot of folks in San Francisco and New York,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something about the pandemic</p>
<p>where people have become quite cynical</p>
<p>about the place they are and they try to escape.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>I mean, they&rsquo;re asking some difficult questions</p>
<p>about what they are in life.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re having like a self imposed midlife crisis.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s good, I think, for everybody to go through this process.</p>
<p>But I think, I hope New York reemerges.</p>
<p>It will.</p>
<p>As the flourishing place for the weirdos.</p>
<p>Anyway, Tom Waits said,</p>
<p>New York, of course, is to be in endless surreal situations</p>
<p>where a $50,000 gun metal Mercedes</p>
<p>pulls up in a puddle of blood</p>
<p>and out steps a 25 carat blonde with a $2 wristwatch.</p>
<p>Woo!</p>
<p>And he goes, he keeps going on.</p>
<p>So like, it&rsquo;s like a.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like bars, he&rsquo;s like a rapper.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah, he&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>But basically, just the absurdity of it all.</p>
<p>Lots of money, lots of weirdos, degenerates,</p>
<p>and dreamers, and the whole mix of it.</p>
<p>Do you think that&rsquo;s an accurate description</p>
<p>of what New York is today?</p>
<p>Like, is there still place for the weirdos</p>
<p>and just the interesting artists,</p>
<p>the edgy, the comedians, the creators,</p>
<p>the entrepreneurs, as opposed to like Wall Street,</p>
<p>as opposed to like rich folk,</p>
<p>and then like hopeless folk?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think it&rsquo;s definitely changed a lot.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a tiny corner for us weirdo artists.</p>
<p>New York used to be where you went to make it</p>
<p>as a painter or whatever, a comedian or a singer.</p>
<p>And there were all these dives and shit boxes</p>
<p>and all these places you could go.</p>
<p>And now it&rsquo;s more Pink Berries</p>
<p>and Subway Sandwiches and Chase Banks.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s definitely lost a lot of its creative edge.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just money, money keeps coming in.</p>
<p>And now you see all these comedians move to Nashville,</p>
<p>Austin, Denver, whatever.</p>
<p>So it doesn&rsquo;t have the power it used to have</p>
<p>of like, you gotta be here if you wanna make it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s definitely gone.</p>
<p>So that hurt the city a lot.</p>
<p>The city is way more soulless.</p>
<p>When I moved here in 07,</p>
<p>I mean, not only did I get mugged three times</p>
<p>in the first year, but it was a hub of like,</p>
<p>it felt like things were happening here.</p>
<p>It was an energy, it was electricity.</p>
<p>And we still have the electricity,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also maybe just cause there&rsquo;s Times Square,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s Soho, there&rsquo;s Wall Street.</p>
<p>So we got the staples, but there is a little bit of that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like a marriage.</p>
<p>Like, yeah, we&rsquo;re in love,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not as passionate as it once was.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how I would equate New York.</p>
<p>What gives you hope?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re pretty hopeful about it though.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m hopeful just cause I know it&rsquo;s magical</p>
<p>and I think it has to be.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s the epicenter of America.</p>
<p>Like this is where the immigrants came</p>
<p>and this is where the stock market is</p>
<p>and the entertainment industry, a lot of it is here.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s gonna happen,</p>
<p>but something like the bottom has to fall out</p>
<p>and then people have to move back here and all that.</p>
<p>So something, the corporations are kind of fucking us.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just buying everything.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s true for everything.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true for everything.</p>
<p>This is true for Austin probably as well.</p>
<p>People are just buying out land and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>You always hear a Hemingway and Dali</p>
<p>and all these guys went to Paris in the 20s</p>
<p>or whatever that was.</p>
<p>I get it now.</p>
<p>I used to be like, why do these guys go to Paris?</p>
<p>Why do these artists?</p>
<p>And now I get it.</p>
<p>Cause it&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s freer there.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why Austin became like that Paris</p>
<p>where everybody&rsquo;s like, I gotta get out of LA.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going there.</p>
<p>And maybe, but we came back from that.</p>
<p>70s were wild and 90s were cool.</p>
<p>So maybe it&rsquo;ll come back.</p>
<p>Might just take a decade.</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s always, that&rsquo;s how stories are told.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s always pockets of like Paris within New York.</p>
<p>True, true.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just an opportunity to let your weird flourish</p>
<p>is there in New York, I&rsquo;m sure.</p>
<p>There, I mean.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s there.</p>
<p>You gotta find it.</p>
<p>Before it was front and center.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your favorite thing about New York?</p>
<p>Like what kind of things just like.</p>
<p>I mean, how long is this pod?</p>
<p>I could go on.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s too much to put into one hour.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got other questions, but I love that one neighborhood</p>
<p>is wildly different than the next.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in Little Italy and then you take four steps.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m in Chinatown.</p>
<p>I mean, and then the history there and then the stories</p>
<p>and the food and the culture and all that.</p>
<p>And then you go 10 feet over here.</p>
<p>Now you&rsquo;re in Brooklyn.</p>
<p>And this is insane as a whole nother world.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s almost like a little America in one,</p>
<p>you know, city and it&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>And just the fact that they pulled it off</p>
<p>like Fifth Avenue goes way up.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re like, there&rsquo;s a billionaire&rsquo;s house</p>
<p>next to a hobo.</p>
<p>And then this is a black guy who&rsquo;s fighting with a Cuban guy</p>
<p>and an Asian guy is trying to get in the middle of them.</p>
<p>And the cabbie&rsquo;s from the Middle East.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s so many beautiful women here.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s so many brilliant minds here.</p>
<p>And the pace is great.</p>
<p>It keeps people moving.</p>
<p>I mean, it just, you can&rsquo;t beat it.</p>
<p>And the city will fuck you in the ass too.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong.</p>
<p>You landed JFK and you&rsquo;re like, oh God, I got mugged.</p>
<p>My Uber driver called me a homo.</p>
<p>I stepped in human shit.</p>
<p>Where the fuck am I?</p>
<p>So yeah, it&rsquo;s bad news.</p>
<p>But that bad news, it&rsquo;s almost like the bullying.</p>
<p>It kills you in a weird way, but it makes you stronger.</p>
<p>And you build more layers and layers and layers.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why some new guys,</p>
<p>some hayseed from Milwaukee shows up.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve been here 10 years and you go,</p>
<p>let me help you out.</p>
<p>Cause you gotta adjust.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna get your ass kicked for like six months.</p>
<p>But I know the ropes a little,</p>
<p>and I think you need a little of that.</p>
<p>If the treadmill&rsquo;s not on, you&rsquo;re not gonna run.</p>
<p>New York, the treadmill&rsquo;s on.</p>
<p>So it just makes you run and it makes you better.</p>
<p>And look, it wears on you.</p>
<p>You probably lose 10 years of your life</p>
<p>living in New York versus Indianapolis,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a better life.</p>
<p>Have you seen 25th Hour?</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s been a while.</p>
<p>Spike Lee joint.</p>
<p>Yeah, Spike Lee joint.</p>
<p>I mean, at Norton, there&rsquo;s a whole monologue there</p>
<p>about New York.</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re talking about just, he has like a mix.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s like melancholy music, I think,</p>
<p>or just a melancholy feel to the whole thing.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s an anger and a disgust with the city.</p>
<p>But through the anger and the disgust</p>
<p>comes out like a love for the city.</p>
<p>Same with, was Taxi Driver in New York?</p>
<p>Oh yeah, it&rsquo;s going crazy.</p>
<p>Yeah, so like that, there&rsquo;s something about, what is that?</p>
<p>What is that grit of the city that like pushes you down?</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s the beauty of this city</p>
<p>is it&rsquo;s this tribal human nature,</p>
<p>like the sex shops and fistfights and racism</p>
<p>and all this tension,</p>
<p>but yet it&rsquo;s the epicenter of technology and finance</p>
<p>and sophistication on Fifth Avenue.</p>
<p>So you get that juxtaposition.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of like in Boston.</p>
<p>You go to Boston, they got MIT, they got Harvard,</p>
<p>they got all this shit.</p>
<p>And then they got the fishermen, the blue collar douchebags,</p>
<p>the Irish guys, the immigrants,</p>
<p>and you get that mix of like insanely smart</p>
<p>with wicked pisser and these two worlds.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a good thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like when a black guy fucks an Asian lady,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a good looking kid.</p>
<p>You get a mix.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re mixing two totally different things</p>
<p>are coming together and it makes it,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like peanut butter and chocolate.</p>
<p>Peanut butter and chocolate, I&rsquo;ve never tried that.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Peanut butter, maybe I have.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re talking about Reese&rsquo;s, man.</p>
<p>Like Reese&rsquo;s, yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Oh, it&rsquo;s the best candy.</p>
<p>Yeah, without the fakeness of LA,</p>
<p>without the kind of, with the facade.</p>
<p>Yeah, LA&rsquo;s tough.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the difference between LA comedy</p>
<p>and New York comedy to you?</p>
<p>I think one place you kind of go to make it</p>
<p>and be discovered and be loved,</p>
<p>and one place you go, you can get all that in New York too,</p>
<p>but I think in New York, it&rsquo;s more of a school,</p>
<p>a bootcamp of comedy.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s make great comedy.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s make original comedy.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s watch the other guys and gals</p>
<p>who are at the show at the clubs and learn from them</p>
<p>and try to hang out with them and absorb some of them.</p>
<p>And in LA, it&rsquo;s like, when am I on?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m next, get out of my way.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m the star here.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a bigger star than you.</p>
<p>Oh, this guy&rsquo;s actually a big star.</p>
<p>I got to outwork, you know, it&rsquo;s just a lot of that</p>
<p>instead of like, damn, that was funny.</p>
<p>I got to be that funny.</p>
<p>Damn, I wish I had a joke.</p>
<p>And look, I don&rsquo;t want to speak for LA comics</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s, you know, Bill Burr, Anthony Jeslenek,</p>
<p>brilliant LA comic, but they all cut their teeth</p>
<p>in New York, just saying.</p>
<p>Then they moved to LA.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good point.</p>
<p>You know, Ali Wong, all these people, killer comics,</p>
<p>but New York, started in New York, moved to New York.</p>
<p>There is something about comics that stay in New York</p>
<p>for a long time though, like Dave Attell.</p>
<p>Ah, you know about Dave?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, he wants to do this podcast.</p>
<p>He does?</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m a huge fan of Dave Attell.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s like, he almost like he doesn&rsquo;t want to make it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I mean, you probably know him, but like,</p>
<p>it feels like you just, maybe it&rsquo;s romanticizing it,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re like, you almost just love the art of comedy,</p>
<p>like becoming funnier, crafting the jokes,</p>
<p>becoming funnier than the other comics,</p>
<p>like competing with each other kind of thing,</p>
<p>not over like money or fame or any of that,</p>
<p>just purely the comedy of it.</p>
<p>Totally, that&rsquo;s Dave.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s him in a nutshell.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like that guy in the movies in the 80s,</p>
<p>action movies, where they&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>they go up to a creek in Montana,</p>
<p>and some guy&rsquo;s living in a cabin,</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s sharpening a stick, and they go,</p>
<p>the Russians are coming, they&rsquo;re invading.</p>
<p>We need you, you&rsquo;re the best commando.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, I gave that up, man.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m done with that lifestyle.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like, but you&rsquo;re the best, we need you.</p>
<p>And he has to suit up eventually.</p>
<p>You know, he looks at a picture of his dead wife,</p>
<p>and he goes, fuck it, I&rsquo;m going.</p>
<p>And then they, you know, fight the Ruskies.</p>
<p>But he&rsquo;s that guy.</p>
<p>He just is gifted.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like got a gift from Allah, and he&rsquo;s the best.</p>
<p>Yeah, a lot of comics give him props.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s always surprising to me.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s surprising to me</p>
<p>because he hasn&rsquo;t really made it, like big.</p>
<p>Well, he did.</p>
<p>In the 90s, he was huge.</p>
<p>He had his own TV show.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, that show was awesome.</p>
<p>But I mean, like as big as I think he deserves to be.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s art.</p>
<p>The mainstream shit is always the worst.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like McDonald&rsquo;s versus some hole in the wall.</p>
<p>I know I&rsquo;m shitting on McDonald&rsquo;s again, but it&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>And you know, certain comics we could name are good,</p>
<p>but the delicacy is going to be less talked about</p>
<p>and less household namey than the mainstream hacky shit.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s funny because he hasn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>I think it was on Joe Rogan&rsquo;s show once, maybe.</p>
<p>Yeah, once or twice.</p>
<p>And he was with somebody else.</p>
<p>Jeff Ross?</p>
<p>Yeah, he might have known Jeff Ross.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, because they did that like two mics thing,</p>
<p>whatever.</p>
<p>Oh, big mics, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But he&rsquo;s the quickest guy.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no one funnier.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, him and you, you&rsquo;re super quick.</p>
<p>Your appearance on, recent appearance on Rogan&rsquo;s hilarious.</p>
<p>Oh, thanks.</p>
<p>Just so fast.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re on with Ari and&hellip;</p>
<p>Shane Gillis.</p>
<p>Yeah, that was fun.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going back in January.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know when this comes out.</p>
<p>This has never come out.</p>
<p>Neither will you.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re having fun.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>All right, so what does it feel like to bomb</p>
<p>in standup comedy, like to fail?</p>
<p>Maybe the psychology of it first,</p>
<p>like just take me through it.</p>
<p>Cause we&rsquo;re talking about being outnumbered in a fight,</p>
<p>just being beat up.</p>
<p>Very similar.</p>
<p>By the way, this is like a no eye contact off.</p>
<p>Yeah, we&rsquo;re both uncomfortable with it.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of nice to be with my people, but yeah.</p>
<p>Do you need a sheet of paper to look at it?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going, I got a good sweet spot right there.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s a nightmare, but it&rsquo;s part of it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the validation too is the worst part.</p>
<p>Cause you know, whenever you do comedy and kill,</p>
<p>you can be a great comic,</p>
<p>but even David Tell, these brilliant guys,</p>
<p>they feel like they&rsquo;re getting,</p>
<p>you feel like you&rsquo;re getting away with something.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have a day job.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m telling jokes for a living.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking about my dick up here</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re fucking loving me.</p>
<p>And they call me a genius and all this.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking about my sack, you know?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>It makes people happy and it&rsquo;s funny,</p>
<p>but that bombing, when you bomb,</p>
<p>your first thought is like, yeah, you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>At first you&rsquo;re like, fuck you guys.</p>
<p>What, you don&rsquo;t like this shit?</p>
<p>And then you just start going in.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like, man, maybe it isn&rsquo;t that good.</p>
<p>Maybe they&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>I do suck.</p>
<p>I knew I sucked.</p>
<p>I should become a mailman, you know?</p>
<p>And it stinks and you feel alone.</p>
<p>And you feel like you wasted their time.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;re like, what was I thinking?</p>
<p>I could be a comedian.</p>
<p>What the fuck, who am I?</p>
<p>You know, Eddie Murphy, what am I doing here?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a lot of just spiraling out of horrible thoughts.</p>
<p>But I also love that it hurts so bad.</p>
<p>Bombing fucking hurts because now everybody doesn&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>I think a lot more people could do comedy probably</p>
<p>and figure it out.</p>
<p>But the bombing is so brutal</p>
<p>that it keeps, one time I went to Minneapolis.</p>
<p>I was like, this is a great city.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s a sun is shining.</p>
<p>Why isn&rsquo;t this city like packed?</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re like, cause the winters are so bad</p>
<p>and we love it because it keeps everybody out.</p>
<p>And I feel like the same about comedy.</p>
<p>The bombs are so brutal.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had bombs where I&rsquo;m in bed.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just staring at the ceiling like, what the fuck was that?</p>
<p>Like you have PTSD.</p>
<p>I bombed at an arena once, 20,000 people.</p>
<p>I did 30 minutes to silence.</p>
<p>I guess.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not just like one joke fails.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like they start piling on like it&rsquo;s irrecoverable.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And one joke failing is very common.</p>
<p>Like a lot of audience don&rsquo;t even notice like that bomb.</p>
<p>Cause you get, you know, you&rsquo;ve got so many jokes in a row.</p>
<p>You can sandwich a good one, then a bad one,</p>
<p>then a good one.</p>
<p>But when you bomb, it&rsquo;s almost like they chose,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t like you.</p>
<p>Nothing you say will redeem yourself.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s hard to get out of.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like being pulled down by your hair.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t get back.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t win this fight no matter what.</p>
<p>Can you like get them back by acknowledging</p>
<p>like the elephant in the room that like.</p>
<p>That helps, but they&rsquo;re still gonna go,</p>
<p>that was funny when he made fun of it, but he sucks.</p>
<p>He still sucks.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the worst part.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going, no, this is good.</p>
<p>You guys just don&rsquo;t like me.</p>
<p>Just cause you don&rsquo;t like me doesn&rsquo;t mean I&rsquo;m bad.</p>
<p>Yeah, I like going to open mics a lot.</p>
<p>Just listening because first of all,</p>
<p>I think the audience in open mic,</p>
<p>at least the ones I&rsquo;ve been to,</p>
<p>is mostly I guess other comedians</p>
<p>or like at least people who don&rsquo;t seem</p>
<p>to want to laugh at anything.</p>
<p>And so I just love it because it&rsquo;s human nature</p>
<p>and perseverance that is best.</p>
<p>That here&rsquo;s comedians, like clearly,</p>
<p>this is mostly in Austin.</p>
<p>They have a dream.</p>
<p>Like why would you get up there?</p>
<p>Right, maybe some weird, you know,</p>
<p>New Year&rsquo;s resolution bullshit,</p>
<p>but for the most part, it&rsquo;s people who want to be comedians.</p>
<p>Like a lot of the open micers are people</p>
<p>who clearly have done this for quite a long time already.</p>
<p>Like at least a year or two, maybe five years.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re often not very funny.</p>
<p>And just bombing in front of an audience of like 20</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re just sitting there,</p>
<p>like almost like mocking them with their eyes</p>
<p>or maybe, and I don&rsquo;t know, and they still push through.</p>
<p>They still like, as if they&rsquo;re doing an arena</p>
<p>and everybody&rsquo;s laughing.</p>
<p>They still got that energy trying.</p>
<p>Almost like to an audience that doesn&rsquo;t exist.</p>
<p>Like an audience of their dreams.</p>
<p>Cause I guess that you have to do that</p>
<p>to keep the energy of the act going.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just so beautiful to watch them try it.</p>
<p>And also what happens, open mic,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, five minutes, whatever they do,</p>
<p>they walk off and then walk back off stage.</p>
<p>And like, you can&rsquo;t, who do they look at?</p>
<p>Like what do you look at, do you make eye contact</p>
<p>with people, do you?</p>
<p>You look at your phone, you look at your feet,</p>
<p>you just zone out.</p>
<p>You kind of kind of go white, you know,</p>
<p>you just hear white noise and go out.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s tough, but you got it.</p>
<p>You need a little delusion to be a comedian.</p>
<p>To get into it, it takes a little bit of delusion.</p>
<p>Like you think you can do this, you know,</p>
<p>you got 10 years ahead of you of hell</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re up for this.</p>
<p>And you know, most comics, we see a horrible crowd</p>
<p>and we see our friend bomb and we go,</p>
<p>yeah, he&rsquo;s bombing, but I&rsquo;ll get him.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll get him.</p>
<p>And then you don&rsquo;t get him, but that&rsquo;s human nature too.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, they don&rsquo;t like him, but they&rsquo;ll like me.</p>
<p>And you need a little of that to keep going as a comedian.</p>
<p>But you don&rsquo;t want too much delusion</p>
<p>because then you&rsquo;re a psycho, but you need a little.</p>
<p>Well, the psycho could be good for a comedy.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true too, love psychos.</p>
<p>I mentioned to you offline that I talked to Elon</p>
<p>and we talked about doing standup,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s thinking maybe do a few minutes of standup.</p>
<p>I was gonna say, if you need a coach, Elon, I gotcha.</p>
<p>Well, maybe you should move to Austin</p>
<p>to coach him full time.</p>
<p>Ah, hopefully he can fly me in.</p>
<p>So what advice would you give to somebody</p>
<p>who wants to try to do five minutes,</p>
<p>like the early steps of trying to go to an open mic</p>
<p>and say something funny?</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s the irony of comedy is,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s irony,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s like the beginning is the hardest part.</p>
<p>Usually the beginning is easy part.</p>
<p>Hey, I&rsquo;m playing this level of Mario.</p>
<p>I start, I jump over one Koopa Troopa, whatever.</p>
<p>And then the end is like, Jesus Christ,</p>
<p>I got 30 guys coming at me.</p>
<p>Comedy is the opposite.</p>
<p>The beginning is like, it&rsquo;s a gauntlet.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just obstacles.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like you said, open mics.</p>
<p>I watched these famous comedians on Netflix and you go,</p>
<p>this would all bomb at an open mic.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re killing in Radio City.</p>
<p>This would bomb at an open mic.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the weird part.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s almost like you have to go through hell</p>
<p>just to get to the promised land.</p>
<p>And I would say, rehearse the shit out of it</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re gonna get frazzled up there.</p>
<p>Everybody thinks, oh, this is good material.</p>
<p>But you also forget about the other part of delivering it,</p>
<p>having confidence, being likable,</p>
<p>having timing, having a cadence,</p>
<p>figuring out who you are,</p>
<p>figuring out what the audience thinks you are</p>
<p>or how they perceive you.</p>
<p>Cause you can go up there and say all this,</p>
<p>but they go, why is the guy, he&rsquo;s clearly gay.</p>
<p>Why is he acting like he&rsquo;s not gay?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all, now they&rsquo;re not listening to the joke.</p>
<p>So like, you gotta know how you look.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just repetition, repetition.</p>
<p>And bombing is not failure.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what you gotta remember.</p>
<p>I mean, look, if you do a killer hour</p>
<p>and then you take it to Netflix and bomb, you fucked up.</p>
<p>But bombing is not failure.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just data.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going, oh, okay, I gotta retool that.</p>
<p>That didn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>Something&rsquo;s wrong there.</p>
<p>I missed a word there.</p>
<p>So you gotta treat the act</p>
<p>almost like ingredients in a cooking, in a dish.</p>
<p>You know, like, oh, I put too many eggs in.</p>
<p>Take an egg out.</p>
<p>You gotta treat it like that.</p>
<p>And look, when you pull a bad cake out of an oven,</p>
<p>you go, I fucked up.</p>
<p>But it doesn&rsquo;t hurt your feelings.</p>
<p>But when you bomb and fuck up, it hurts your feelings.</p>
<p>So you gotta factor that in too.</p>
<p>Your feelings gonna be hurt</p>
<p>and just almost be a robot</p>
<p>and just keep going towards that open mic.</p>
<p>You know how scary an open mic is?</p>
<p>Bombing sucks, but bombing in front of other comedians</p>
<p>is way worse.</p>
<p>Cause they know what just happened</p>
<p>and they could have saved you and they didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s way worse.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re gonna be your quote unquote friends</p>
<p>for this journey.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, these are evil people.</p>
<p>Twisted, fucked up, hurt people.</p>
<p>Can you tell, like in those early days,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s just talk about that,</p>
<p>like at the open mic level</p>
<p>that a joke is gonna be good on paper.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;ll give you my experience</p>
<p>cause maybe you could be my coach</p>
<p>in this particular moment.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>Like Larry Nassar.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fun, huh?</p>
<p>Joking, everybody.</p>
<p>I hope nobody takes it seriously.</p>
<p>I now have an amazing team of folks</p>
<p>who help me with editing</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re now currently sweating.</p>
<p>Watch this.</p>
<p>We gotta leave that one in.</p>
<p>That was quick.</p>
<p>Yeah, that was pretty good.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll leave that one.</p>
<p>That was good.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>So going in front of an audience,</p>
<p>just even to give a lecture terrifies me,</p>
<p>which I&rsquo;ve done.</p>
<p>But open mic, I mean, that to me,</p>
<p>perhaps that&rsquo;s why I like going to open mics and listening</p>
<p>is cause I just, it terrifies me so much,</p>
<p>that idea of going up there and bombing.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s scary.</p>
<p>And to do even like one minute, to be honest, is scary.</p>
<p>And five minutes, I&rsquo;m also watched enough open mics</p>
<p>to realize that five minutes is a long time.</p>
<p>I mean, it depends on your comedy,</p>
<p>but if you&rsquo;re doing fast stuff,</p>
<p>five minutes is a really long time.</p>
<p>Oh, it&rsquo;s eternity.</p>
<p>I guess with a long story, too, is a long time</p>
<p>because if the story&rsquo;s not working,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re building up to something.</p>
<p>If the story&rsquo;s gonna fail,</p>
<p>you just spent all that time telling the story</p>
<p>that completely went flat.</p>
<p>Completely. Got nothing.</p>
<p>I guess if you have a series of jokes,</p>
<p>you can at least try to recover</p>
<p>and like do the Mitch Hedberg thing</p>
<p>where like, all right, I&rsquo;ll cross that off.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m able to, like I&rsquo;ve tried to write a few things</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m able to tell that it&rsquo;s really bad.</p>
<p>Ah, ha, ha, ha, ha, well, that&rsquo;s better than most.</p>
<p>Most people&rsquo;s egos kick in, they go, no, this is good.</p>
<p>No, see, I&rsquo;m able to introspect that.</p>
<p>Like it seems funny.</p>
<p>I mean, I guess the thing I&rsquo;m looking for is original.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s easy stuff that you think is funny,</p>
<p>but to me, originality is the thing</p>
<p>you should be looking for because then,</p>
<p>because then that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s actually becomes funny.</p>
<p>Like, or rather, if it&rsquo;s original,</p>
<p>even if it bombs, that feels like more</p>
<p>a beautiful art creation that you did.</p>
<p>Like at least you swung for it.</p>
<p>Like you did something unique.</p>
<p>Cause like even with open mic, your first five minutes,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so many, just go to enough open mics,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll hear like all the, there&rsquo;s like a list of jokes</p>
<p>that you can just go to.</p>
<p>First of all, you can make fun of the fact</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re at open mic, that you&rsquo;re like doing this</p>
<p>for the first time and so on.</p>
<p>You could do a lot of stuff where you make fun</p>
<p>of your appearance in some way and so on.</p>
<p>But like, yeah, you could do that.</p>
<p>You know, that takes actually, that&rsquo;s way harder</p>
<p>than people realize to do it in an original way.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>You have to present who you are as a person very quickly,</p>
<p>enough to then put that person down</p>
<p>in front of everybody else.</p>
<p>So you have to reveal the.</p>
<p>The audience is like that,</p>
<p>cause they go, he knows what we&rsquo;re thinking.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>But do it again in an original way.</p>
<p>And so like when I&rsquo;m trying to write stuff,</p>
<p>when I, not that I&rsquo;ve tried long, it&rsquo;s like 30 minutes,</p>
<p>but as enough to see like, oh shit,</p>
<p>to write something original is really difficult.</p>
<p>It is, but do you got a bit, anything?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>You didn&rsquo;t write any one line or anything?</p>
<p>For this?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Well, just in general, ever in your life,</p>
<p>ever written a joke?</p>
<p>Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Oh, okay.</p>
<p>No, but I don&rsquo;t have anything in my mind popped up.</p>
<p>So the jokes that I&rsquo;ve written have more,</p>
<p>like for some reason my mind goes to like dark places.</p>
<p>So, you know, like, and not actually dark</p>
<p>in the Mark Norman dark, because you go really dark</p>
<p>to where it&rsquo;s like almost absurd.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>My natural inclination is to go to like</p>
<p>a dark historical like place, like Hitler and Stalin.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And almost, so go to that place</p>
<p>and then talk about something absurd there.</p>
<p>So like, don&rsquo;t go like all the way, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to give examples because it&rsquo;d be clipped,</p>
<p>but the Mark Norman style, look it up.</p>
<p>He has a special on his YouTube, that kind.</p>
<p>I want to almost explore the dark aspects</p>
<p>of human nature more kind of connected</p>
<p>to actual historical figures.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the inclination.</p>
<p>Like, I don&rsquo;t know, Nature&rsquo;s Metal,</p>
<p>the Instagram channel that explores</p>
<p>like the darkness of nature, like something there.</p>
<p>See, that&rsquo;s good that you already know</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve kind of gotten to the core</p>
<p>of your comedy already.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s interesting, that&rsquo;s a step ahead.</p>
<p>Yeah, I can hear, with most things that I do in life,</p>
<p>I can like hear the music from a distance,</p>
<p>like in myself, like, okay, if you have anything,</p>
<p>this is the direction it&rsquo;ll be</p>
<p>without actually knowing exactly all the steps.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a nice motivation to be like, all right,</p>
<p>well, if you do this for a long time,</p>
<p>maybe you&rsquo;ll have a chance to get there.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>But you have to, that&rsquo;s where it&rsquo;s a feature</p>
<p>to be super self critical, I think.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>But then that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s fucking terrifying</p>
<p>to walk up to a stage, stand there,</p>
<p>and probably forget everything.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s the other part nobody thinks about.</p>
<p>Just goes right out of your head.</p>
<p>You go fight or flight, it&rsquo;s ugly.</p>
<p>My first years were horrific bombing, horrific stammering,</p>
<p>horrific not remembering the punchline.</p>
<p>Like, you got to, maybe you got a set up going</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re kind of on board and you&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>ah, how&rsquo;s that, ah, camera, camera out it goes.</p>
<p>And you just hate yourself, it&rsquo;s a nightmare.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;ve already kind of,</p>
<p>maybe if you haven&rsquo;t done standup or whatever,</p>
<p>but you kind of know your voice and that&rsquo;s pretty advanced.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re not trying to be somebody else, I guess.</p>
<p>Yeah, just for having done like podcasts</p>
<p>and lecture and so on.</p>
<p>That helps.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve embarrassed, I&rsquo;ve already done some of the work</p>
<p>of the standups do, which is embarrass yourself</p>
<p>in front of others for prolonged periods of time.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Yeah, so I&rsquo;ve done that without actually developing</p>
<p>the funny.</p>
<p>Right, right, right.</p>
<p>But maybe the funny just is not that difficult to develop.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s super difficult, of course,</p>
<p>but I mean, maybe the essential work</p>
<p>of a standup comedian is just the embarrassment</p>
<p>of like finding who you are.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s a part of it for sure.</p>
<p>You know, in the beginning you&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>water bottle, what&rsquo;s funny about water bottle?</p>
<p>Hmm, I&rsquo;m a funny guy, I can make this funny,</p>
<p>but that ain&rsquo;t, that&rsquo;s not it, you know?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s your shit, your shit, like your dark stuff.</p>
<p>For me, I tend to gravitate towards dark,</p>
<p>but in a weird way where, you know,</p>
<p>people will say like, hey, don&rsquo;t objectify women.</p>
<p>But then they go, Caitlyn Jenner&rsquo;s beautiful.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re like, well, wait, I know something&rsquo;s off here.</p>
<p>Why can you objectify her, but not the supermodel?</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s going on there?</p>
<p>And I like to play with that.</p>
<p>So I have this joke where I say, Caitlyn Jenner,</p>
<p>oh, women go, Caitlyn Jenner&rsquo;s beautiful, beautiful woman.</p>
<p>I go, well, you look like her, and they go, fuck you.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re like, there&rsquo;s a lot of truth there.</p>
<p>But I like exploring that kind of,</p>
<p>oh, you&rsquo;re trying to get one over on me,</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re lying to yourself, or what are we doing here?</p>
<p>And I like that kind of comedy.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see color, well, I&rsquo;m black.</p>
<p>No, you&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>Ah, you know, that&rsquo;s fun, because you&rsquo;re lying.</p>
<p>Yeah, okay, so like big time comedians such as yourself</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t like to think of yourself in this way, but.</p>
<p>There we go.</p>
<p>Yeah, this is like where you over philosophize comedy, but.</p>
<p>Yeah, definitely.</p>
<p>It seems like comedians.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t say important.</p>
<p>Nothing worse than a comedian who thinks they&rsquo;re important.</p>
<p>Yeah, so I was going, I was trying to find,</p>
<p>as I was trying to say these words,</p>
<p>I realized how cliche it is and how uninteresting it is.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m going to just, but there is something.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m worried this whole thing is uninteresting.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, who cares about comedy?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s like six comics on the planet.</p>
<p>That nobody cares.</p>
<p>Okay, I trust you in the pilot seat.</p>
<p>You know what you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>You got listeners.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve tuned out long ago.</p>
<p>Oh, you got Dan Carlin on here, huh?</p>
<p>Is he around?</p>
<p>Yeah, we&rsquo;re just going back and forth on Twitter just now.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a huge fan.</p>
<p>He was on here before.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;ll be back.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been actually really trying to volunteer myself</p>
<p>aggressively with Dan Carlin for like a Russian episode</p>
<p>where I can speak Russian.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s certain documents.</p>
<p>I talked with Jaco about this too.</p>
<p>Certain things, I mean, I just love the challenge</p>
<p>of bringing Russian documents that I can read in Russian</p>
<p>and then can translate and can try to capture</p>
<p>the depth of the writing in the Russian language</p>
<p>and communicate to the American audience.</p>
<p>So much is lost in translation.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s so much pain and poetry in the Russian language.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just connected to the culture.</p>
<p>Every language, not every language,</p>
<p>but many languages are uniquely able to capture</p>
<p>the culture of the people.</p>
<p>I mean, in some way they&rsquo;re the representation</p>
<p>of the culture of the people.</p>
<p>And so Russian is definitely that,</p>
<p>like represents the full history and culture</p>
<p>of the 20th century with all the atrocities,</p>
<p>all the broken promises, all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>Norm says Russian literature is,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the most tapped into human existence than anything else.</p>
<p>Norm.</p>
<p>McDonald.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>The Russian literature guy.</p>
<p>Dostoevsky, all that shit.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny that there is a gap with comedians too.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a culture of Russian comedy,</p>
<p>like standup comedians that are totally.</p>
<p>Is that right?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know these Russians.</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t know today.</p>
<p>I mean, more from the 80s and 90s and there&rsquo;s a.</p>
<p>Yakov.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all I know.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not, so there&rsquo;s like a force, that&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never seen you that offended.</p>
<p>No, no, no, it&rsquo;s not offended.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a different, there&rsquo;s like the kinesins</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s the edgy.</p>
<p>Is that Russian?</p>
<p>What do you mean?</p>
<p>Wait, I thought you said there was Russian comics.</p>
<p>Yeah, Russian, I mean, I&rsquo;m comparing them.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m giving you like a style of darkness,</p>
<p>like that&rsquo;s the kind of people that kind of challenge.</p>
<p>They give, again, this is to how important comedians are,</p>
<p>is they give a voice to people where in the Soviet Union,</p>
<p>you really can&rsquo;t like express your opposition</p>
<p>to the government.</p>
<p>And so comedians are exceptionally important there</p>
<p>for just, I don&rsquo;t know, channeling the anger,</p>
<p>even when sometimes it&rsquo;s not the actual opposition</p>
<p>to the government, they&rsquo;re just channeling the anger,</p>
<p>the frustration with the absurdity of life.</p>
<p>Like, you know, when there&rsquo;s a shortage of food,</p>
<p>shortage of jobs, the absurdity of the bureaucracy,</p>
<p>like the top heavy government,</p>
<p>just all of that can only sometimes be expressed</p>
<p>with like dark, absurd humor.</p>
<p>And that actually, why there&rsquo;s a culture</p>
<p>of that kind of humor, you know,</p>
<p>you gather around the table with vodka</p>
<p>and all you can do is just talk shit and just.</p>
<p>Be offensive, say horrible shit, ball bust.</p>
<p>I mean, I make school shooting jokes</p>
<p>and people go, how do you do that?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, well, maybe that&rsquo;s how I deal with it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You know, like how come I gotta empathize the way you do?</p>
<p>Maybe we&rsquo;re different.</p>
<p>All right, so now let&rsquo;s skip the whole open mic thing</p>
<p>and crafting jokes.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, that&rsquo;s tough.</p>
<p>Kerouac said, one day I will find the right words</p>
<p>and they will be simple.</p>
<p>When do you know the joke is done, it&rsquo;s perfect.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re somebody that does like really sharp,</p>
<p>like fast jokes.</p>
<p>Wow. Oh, thanks.</p>
<p>So like there&rsquo;s somebody, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know who you see yourself in the same school as,</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;re darker and faster than Hedberg, I think,</p>
<p>in terms of like, just, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>the turns you take are very fast.</p>
<p>Thanks, I appreciate it.</p>
<p>I think I got some Norm Macdonald and maybe.</p>
<p>Oh, Norm, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>You know, obviously Norm,</p>
<p>but Chris Rock was huge for me.</p>
<p>Chris Rock, old like 90s Chris Rock was like,</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know you could do jokes like that.</p>
<p>I always loved George Carlin and Groucho Marx</p>
<p>and Bill Murray, there&rsquo;s so many different types of comedy.</p>
<p>But when I saw the bigger and blacker bring the pain,</p>
<p>I was like, oh my God, this is like, it hit me.</p>
<p>So that was big.</p>
<p>And then Norm&rsquo;s just like the funniest guy on the planet.</p>
<p>So him being the smartest guy in the room,</p>
<p>but acting dumb was great.</p>
<p>So yeah, Chris Rock has that way of cutting to the bullshit,</p>
<p>which I mentioned earlier.</p>
<p>I liked that cutting through the bullshit</p>
<p>kind of style of comedy, because you kind of go,</p>
<p>oh, I&rsquo;m not crazy.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I thought too.</p>
<p>I was too scared to say it, but I thought that.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s saying it in a room of people are laughing.</p>
<p>Maybe I&rsquo;m not an idiot.</p>
<p>So that helped me.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s observational, but not Jerry Seinfeld</p>
<p>observational, it&rsquo;s like going to the darker thing.</p>
<p>To like within society.</p>
<p>But I like him too, but seeing it,</p>
<p>doing it about stuff like in your life, society.</p>
<p>Yeah, race, gender, government, politics,</p>
<p>all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Exactly, exactly, sex, human emotions,</p>
<p>jealousy, whatever it is, that&rsquo;s the good stuff.</p>
<p>How&rsquo;d you feel when Norm passed away?</p>
<p>Ah, that was a bummer because he was, you know what, 61.</p>
<p>And I just didn&rsquo;t see it coming.</p>
<p>And I just, I&rsquo;ve watched so many hours of his stuff</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve met him and he&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>he was like this comedic bar, like, hey, we got Norm.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s so much shit comedy.</p>
<p>Then you see Norm and you&rsquo;re like, this is next level.</p>
<p>This is savant type shit.</p>
<p>And then to lose him is like, ah, Norm had 20 more years</p>
<p>at least of just content and content and thoughts</p>
<p>and his point of view.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, we&rsquo;ll never get that and that sucks.</p>
<p>Yeah, there is something about artists</p>
<p>like Jimi Hendrix dying too early.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, you wonder.</p>
<p>What was next?</p>
<p>Yeah, what was next?</p>
<p>But then part of it is like, you know,</p>
<p>it all ends for all of us and it&rsquo;s like walking away early</p>
<p>is kind of admirable.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like I did a pretty good job.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m good with that.</p>
<p>And especially the way he did, which is not telling anybody.</p>
<p>I know, nine years, his best friends didn&rsquo;t even know.</p>
<p>And in this world of like victimhood</p>
<p>and I need clicks and I need people to love me,</p>
<p>he could have, he got, you know, canceled</p>
<p>and yelled at and in trouble</p>
<p>and he could have pulled that cancer card and he never did.</p>
<p>I mean, the integrity on this motherfucker.</p>
<p>Did you get a chance to interact with him?</p>
<p>Like what, how often did you meet him?</p>
<p>I met him once at the Comedy Cellar</p>
<p>and we chatted for five minutes</p>
<p>and then he went on and did the Letterman set that he did.</p>
<p>He was running the Letterman set.</p>
<p>And sweet guy, nice guy, didn&rsquo;t know him that well,</p>
<p>but I mean, he&rsquo;s just brilliant.</p>
<p>And I also love a brilliant guy who does stupid stuff.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a fun, fun little combo there.</p>
<p>Like silly guys who are actually brilliant also.</p>
<p>You know, like Louis CK is a brilliant comic</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;ll do a joke about farting on a kid.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re like, that&rsquo;s great</p>
<p>that he still finds farts funny</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s also this comedic genius guy.</p>
<p>I like that.</p>
<p>And doesn&rsquo;t really acknowledge the genius.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, I like smart people, they&rsquo;re silly.</p>
<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s a good combo.</p>
<p>Like you said, Elon is silly.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, super silly. Yeah, that&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>Cause we taught, we teach kids like,</p>
<p>hey, put that down, stop that,</p>
<p>quit cutting up, quit horsing around.</p>
<p>But maybe that&rsquo;s some kind of sign of brilliance there.</p>
<p>Yeah, being like childlike and silly is a kind of wisdom.</p>
<p>I feel like those people are way wiser</p>
<p>than the people that, no offense to me,</p>
<p>wear a suit and take themselves way too seriously.</p>
<p>No, but you got a spark in you.</p>
<p>A little bit.</p>
<p>You got a little, what&rsquo;s the word?</p>
<p>Not elf, imp.</p>
<p>Little imp in you.</p>
<p>Give that a go.</p>
<p>You know what imp?</p>
<p>Little mischievous, it&rsquo;s like a little.</p>
<p>Is that a Tolkien character, imp?</p>
<p>Yeah, might be.</p>
<p>An imp is a European mythological being</p>
<p>similar to a fairy or a demon.</p>
<p>Are you calling me a fairy?</p>
<p>Frequently, no, okay.</p>
<p>Similar to a fairy or a demon.</p>
<p>I feel like that&rsquo;s a big leap.</p>
<p>Big leap, yeah, that&rsquo;s not a great info bio there.</p>
<p>Frequently described in folklore and superstition,</p>
<p>the word may perhaps derive from the term imps,</p>
<p>but with a Y, used to denote a young grafted tree.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little mischievous.</p>
<p>You got a twinkle.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re the serious buttoned up guy,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a twinkle.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a twinkle.</p>
<p>And the audience can see the twinkle,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s why you resonate, I think.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry.</p>
<p>Deep Analysis by Mark Norman, Psychological Analysis.</p>
<p>Okay, but then back to the crafting of the joke.</p>
<p>You said Chris Rock and Norm Macdonald.</p>
<p>What for you, how do you know when the joke is done?</p>
<p>Are there some jokes that you&rsquo;re proud of?</p>
<p>Wow, that&rsquo;s well done.</p>
<p>Yeah, the joke is done.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a tough question</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s so many different kinds of jokes.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s what we call a chunk, which is a big idea</p>
<p>with a bunch of jokes in the middle of it,</p>
<p>and then a big crescendo at the end.</p>
<p>Or there&rsquo;s a one liner,</p>
<p>or there&rsquo;s a tag of a joke that&rsquo;s also a joke.</p>
<p>So the jokes come in different,</p>
<p>like I have a joke where I say,</p>
<p>I met my girl in that Jewish app.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s that Jewish app called?</p>
<p>PayPal.</p>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the hell, that&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re asking you</p>
<p>to want from the crowd, but it&rsquo;s a fun turn</p>
<p>because you say your thing</p>
<p>and then I hit you with a misdirect</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what a joke is.</p>
<p>A joke is basically me saying something that makes sense,</p>
<p>but you didn&rsquo;t see it coming.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a perfect example of that.</p>
<p>So that joke took forever to figure out, by the way.</p>
<p>You have to go to different services like PayPal.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s funniest?</p>
<p>Exactly, and I figured PayPal is funny</p>
<p>because it has the word pay in it.</p>
<p>Venmo, it&rsquo;s also not really a good word, Venmo, PayPal.</p>
<p>It just hits better.</p>
<p>Yeah, PayPal is funnier somehow.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funnier somehow,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s the beauty of comedy.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a weird little magic into it.</p>
<p>You can get technical all day and formulaic,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s still that little bit of fairy dust</p>
<p>that you don&rsquo;t know why this is funnier.</p>
<p>Or imp dust.</p>
<p>Imp dust, yes.</p>
<p>With a Y, okay.</p>
<p>So you know what joke is done when it kills,</p>
<p>and this is a roundness to a joke</p>
<p>when you feel like this is buttoned up.</p>
<p>This is done here.</p>
<p>Is simplicity the right word there?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Is it like you&rsquo;re chopping stuff away</p>
<p>or are you adding stuff?</p>
<p>Like what does it feel like?</p>
<p>Simplicity is always the best angle.</p>
<p>I mean, you can get real high concept with a joke</p>
<p>and still make it work, but the simpler the better.</p>
<p>I saw Dave Chappelle on stage once,</p>
<p>and Chris Rock and Demetri Martin were in the back</p>
<p>watching in awe, and Dave Chappelle,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t remember the joke,</p>
<p>but he said something about sex or women,</p>
<p>and Demetri Martin goes, eh, it&rsquo;s a little easy.</p>
<p>And Chris Rock goes, that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>And I remember hearing that as some young comic,</p>
<p>like ah, I&rsquo;m getting this comedy lesson right here</p>
<p>for these two titans.</p>
<p>And so that was fun.</p>
<p>Simple is key.</p>
<p>So the easy is okay.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s such a weird, I think I remember reading</p>
<p>or hearing Eminem say something about</p>
<p>maybe the song Slim Shade.</p>
<p>One of the songs, he&rsquo;s like, I knew it was gonna be good</p>
<p>because it got really repetitive</p>
<p>and annoying very quickly or something like that.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s the sort of the music equivalent</p>
<p>of it&rsquo;s too easy.</p>
<p>Like if it&rsquo;s like super catchy, as a musician,</p>
<p>you might get very quickly bored of it.</p>
<p>Or like as you&rsquo;re creating it, no, it&rsquo;s too easy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like there needs to be some more complexity to it.</p>
<p>I like complexity, but the best guys</p>
<p>who are the ones who make complex shit look simple.</p>
<p>Like you ever heard that Ben Franklin story</p>
<p>where he&rsquo;s talking to his friend,</p>
<p>his friend&rsquo;s like, I&rsquo;m gonna start a hat store.</p>
<p>So he puts a sign out, says, hats for sale, $12.</p>
<p>And Ben Franklin looks at it, he goes,</p>
<p>well, you don&rsquo;t need the $12</p>
<p>because all they need to know is that you got hats for sale.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, all right.</p>
<p>So he loses the $12, makes a new sign, hats for sale.</p>
<p>And he goes, you don&rsquo;t really need for sale</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a business.</p>
<p>People can put that together.</p>
<p>So he just goes, all right.</p>
<p>He makes a new sign, it says hats.</p>
<p>And then Ben Franklin&rsquo;s like, you know,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t really need the word hat.</p>
<p>You can just put a picture of a hat.</p>
<p>And he made a new sign, which is a picture of a hat</p>
<p>and it like helped the business or something.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like some old wives tale or whatever.</p>
<p>But I think about that all the time when I&rsquo;m writing.</p>
<p>I thought this was going to like, there was no sign.</p>
<p>It went like super like nihilistic.</p>
<p>Oh, maybe, maybe, that could work too.</p>
<p>What, like as a comedian, so I&rsquo;m a fan of yours.</p>
<p>I enjoy, I really enjoy you in conversations.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m getting nothing out of it.</p>
<p>This is like emotion.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re tough not to read.</p>
<p>Cold inside.</p>
<p>I mean, just the quickness you have,</p>
<p>obviously you&rsquo;re also a great stand up comedian.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your favorite medium to shine in?</p>
<p>So you have a podcast yourself, an excellent podcast.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re often a podcast guest.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Which is always fun to listen to,</p>
<p>how you&rsquo;re going to deal with the different people.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re great on Rogan.</p>
<p>Oh, thanks.</p>
<p>What do you enjoy most?</p>
<p>Podcasts are great because you can stretch out a little more.</p>
<p>You can breathe a little.</p>
<p>You know, with a stand up set,</p>
<p>I like to be like boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.</p>
<p>But podcasts are great because it&rsquo;s conversational.</p>
<p>So you can be, it&rsquo;s almost like you&rsquo;re being funny</p>
<p>with your friends.</p>
<p>Whereas a stage is like a, this is a piece.</p>
<p>This is a presentation.</p>
<p>But I think the podcast is great,</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t get the reaction.</p>
<p>Unless the host is laughing, you can&rsquo;t hear the guy</p>
<p>in his car in New Jersey driving to work going, ah!</p>
<p>Every now and then I&rsquo;ll read a comment like,</p>
<p>I spit out my coffee when you said this.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, but it&rsquo;s not immediate.</p>
<p>You want the immediate.</p>
<p>So stand up will always be number one,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s no better feeling than killing in a room</p>
<p>of people who don&rsquo;t know who you are.</p>
<p>Strangers, you&rsquo;re in the middle of nowhere.</p>
<p>You left your wife at home.</p>
<p>You left your kids.</p>
<p>You left your house.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re in the middle of bumfucked Dickville</p>
<p>and murdering for these hillbilly nobody, whatever it is.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re slinging their beers and cheering you on.</p>
<p>And they carry out and you fuck some fat lady</p>
<p>and you leave and you get back to your hotel</p>
<p>and you go, holy shit, what was that?</p>
<p>No one will ever know about it.</p>
<p>Just lost in the ether.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the best feeling.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Killing an obscurity as Bill Burr would say.</p>
<p>Yeah, this is one of the things that sucks</p>
<p>about giving lectures.</p>
<p>Like at universities or giving lectures in general</p>
<p>is when you look at the audience, you know,</p>
<p>several hundred students,</p>
<p>they all have a bored look on their face.</p>
<p>Yeah, of course.</p>
<p>Like my face now probably looks bored,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m actually excited to be talking to you.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s something about just,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something about a comedy called,</p>
<p>maybe this is the contingent of laughter,</p>
<p>but like it gives people the freedom to just laugh,</p>
<p>to like, to remove that facade of like,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have to pretend like you don&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>Like if you care, you can show it</p>
<p>and you can have fun with it a lot.</p>
<p>Probably liquor helps out too.</p>
<p>Yeah, it helps for sure.</p>
<p>But there is a, especially,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s why comedy I think is so popular right now</p>
<p>because HR is up our ass.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re scared of old tweets that might come back to haunt us.</p>
<p>What did I say on that interview?</p>
<p>Even people at offices are like,</p>
<p>I put something on Facebook in 1999</p>
<p>that was about fat tits that I liked.</p>
<p>Should I get rid of that?</p>
<p>Even people say like, there&rsquo;s no cancel, whatever.</p>
<p>There is something in the air right now</p>
<p>that wasn&rsquo;t there before.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the video, I&rsquo;m a Karen,</p>
<p>I got caught at Trader Joe, whatever it is.</p>
<p>People rat on each other now,</p>
<p>everybody&rsquo;s tattletaling because they want the clicks.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a horrible society we&rsquo;ve crafted.</p>
<p>But standup comedy gets you to come out,</p>
<p>and now people do it at standup shows too.</p>
<p>Sadly, but it gets you to come out</p>
<p>and let that inhibition down.</p>
<p>Because we&rsquo;re all human,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve all had the fucked up thoughts like,</p>
<p>man, that guy&rsquo;s fat as shit.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t mean you hate the guy,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t mean you hate fat people,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t mean you&rsquo;re fat shaming.</p>
<p>But you can&rsquo;t say that at the office.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t go, Bob, you&rsquo;re fat as shit.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll get fired for body shaming.</p>
<p>But at the club, you go, that guy&rsquo;s fat as shit.</p>
<p>The crowd goes, he is fat as shit.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s this weird cathartic thing</p>
<p>because all we do is tamp shit down.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of like you ever meet a girl</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s like all prim and proper in the bedroom.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s like, put a lamp up my ass.</p>
<p>Ah, you know, whatever it is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because we gotta get it out.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re all repressed in some way.</p>
<p>So I guess what you&rsquo;re saying is comedy&rsquo;s important.</p>
<p>Yes, callback.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Well played, sir.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What do you think about Austin?</p>
<p>What do you think about the comedy scene in Austin?</p>
<p>We talk about LA and New York.</p>
<p>What do you think about what Joe&rsquo;s trying to create there?</p>
<p>So I should say that the reason I moved to Austin,</p>
<p>I have this dream of, it wouldn&rsquo;t be funny</p>
<p>if I said this dream of becoming a comedian.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an audience, at least.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>You know, I always said you can hear</p>
<p>the music in the distance.</p>
<p>I have this dream around robotics</p>
<p>and artificial intelligence, whether it&rsquo;s a company,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s something else that I was just pulling me to.</p>
<p>I actually wanted to move to San Francisco,</p>
<p>and then all my friends in San Francisco said,</p>
<p>no, it&rsquo;s the wrong place.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>At this time, the cynicism there</p>
<p>is just not conducive to taking big leaps</p>
<p>into the unknown, excited about the future kind of thing.</p>
<p>And Austin was that, for me in particular with Elon Musk,</p>
<p>but also just the energy that everybody had,</p>
<p>including Joe, the excitement about the future.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care if Austin burns to the ground</p>
<p>and it actually is a complete failure.</p>
<p>Being excited about the future seems to be,</p>
<p>like optimism about the future,</p>
<p>seems to be the thing that actually</p>
<p>makes that future happen, makes a great future happen.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s always cool for me to see Joe</p>
<p>super excited about creating a culture in Austin,</p>
<p>like making it a comedy hub.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to overstate it,</p>
<p>but I think he really believes it&rsquo;ll be</p>
<p>a very big place for comedy in the United States</p>
<p>and generally in the world.</p>
<p>And so just even believing that, that&rsquo;s powerful.</p>
<p>I agree.</p>
<p>You start to make it happen, that energy is there.</p>
<p>Anyway, so, but that&rsquo;s for me from just an outsider</p>
<p>watching the fun of it.</p>
<p>I should also mention for less of an outsider,</p>
<p>more insider in the martial arts world,</p>
<p>partially probably because of Joe, I&rsquo;m not sure,</p>
<p>like John Donahar, Gordon Ryan, the B Team,</p>
<p>all of those folks, those are, that might be gibberish</p>
<p>to you, but those are like some of the greatest grapplers</p>
<p>in martial artists of all time.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s also becoming this hub of martial arts.</p>
<p>So the whole thing is just beautiful.</p>
<p>Anyway, what are your thoughts about that scene?</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s a lot here, a lot of things to mention.</p>
<p>One, I think Joe did do that to a degree,</p>
<p>like all these people, Segura lives there now,</p>
<p>a lot of comics live there.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s opening clubs, other clubs are opening.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the other thing is people go,</p>
<p>everybody&rsquo;s moving to Austin, Austin&rsquo;s the new hub.</p>
<p>And then they look at their watch and they go,</p>
<p>five minutes went by, nothing changed.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna take years, but everybody wants it now, now, now.</p>
<p>What, Austin, there&rsquo;s no industry there.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no Netflix, whatever.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re like, yeah, I know, but it needs a minute.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t just do this overnight.</p>
<p>So people forget that.</p>
<p>So it could happen huge, just give it some time.</p>
<p>I mean, he&rsquo;s opening a club, I went and saw it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s incredible, like it&rsquo;s so perfect for comedy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s every detail, it&rsquo;s incredible.</p>
<p>But so it could happen still.</p>
<p>I do think there&rsquo;s a little biting off more</p>
<p>than they can chew with Austin because it&rsquo;s not that big.</p>
<p>So like.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s spread out.</p>
<p>I mean, yeah, it&rsquo;s not big.</p>
<p>And the infrastructure is not quite there to support it.</p>
<p>But it has a lot of, comparing from the tech side,</p>
<p>it has a lot of land to expand into.</p>
<p>So it might become this. That helps.</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;re basically establishing,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of like when you&rsquo;re in New York,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re establishing these whole neighborhoods.</p>
<p>And you have the freedom to do that</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s a lot of space on all sides.</p>
<p>Yes, okay, so that helps.</p>
<p>So again, maybe some time.</p>
<p>I do agree with that new hope</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s kind of built into human beings of like,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s go to America, let&rsquo;s go to the utopia.</p>
<p>We even have it with space.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go to Mars.</p>
<p>We gotta see what&rsquo;s over there.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just red, dusty bullshit, but you still gotta go.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m with you on that about this new hope, this new land.</p>
<p>And I think that is beautiful.</p>
<p>And I think there&rsquo;s a lot of haters.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a lot of naysayers who hate change,</p>
<p>who hate anything new.</p>
<p>And then I think you gotta go, hey, that hurts, that sucks,</p>
<p>but blow me dickless.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying something.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a loser.</p>
<p>Stop hating on me.</p>
<p>I mean, how many people hate Elon Musk?</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s hilarious.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s some of the criticism on Austin.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a fad.</p>
<p>Like a lot of people are really, people are excited</p>
<p>about Austin and somehow that&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like when Green Day became famous,</p>
<p>you no longer want to be a fan of Green Day.</p>
<p>But to me, like that&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>Well, Austin was already a cool town.</p>
<p>Like every comic five years ago, it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>oh, I got Austin this weekend, I can&rsquo;t wait.</p>
<p>So it already had a buzz,</p>
<p>but some people think maybe the buzz was the cool part.</p>
<p>The fact that it was like this off the beaten path city</p>
<p>and now I get to visit it and then leave.</p>
<p>But I think it could still be</p>
<p>this comedy tech booming place.</p>
<p>It just will take some time and people want it right now.</p>
<p>Well, on the tech side, it&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s already there?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s getting there very fast.</p>
<p>So, I mean, Elon&rsquo;s really pushing that with the factory.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a huge number of people are moving there with jobs.</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;re already starting.</p>
<p>And then the opportunities to launch new companies</p>
<p>is just incredible.</p>
<p>I guess it&rsquo;s not right now.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like within months, within a year, that kind of thing.</p>
<p>But like, it&rsquo;s an opportunity to just</p>
<p>start to build shit in a new place.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s cool.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of like going to Mars.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like you get to start over.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I like the hope aspect.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s huge for people.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m all for it.</p>
<p>I hope it works out.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it will,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t know anything about economies</p>
<p>and city planning and all that shit.</p>
<p>So it might be too early to say, but I hope it works.</p>
<p>Are you still talking about Austin or Mars?</p>
<p>Austin.</p>
<p>Mars is, eh, there&rsquo;s nothing there.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no vagina there.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no food there.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no water there.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>It seems, I get space travel.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s important.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t know Mars is really gonna move the needle.</p>
<p>So what are your thoughts about Elon Musk and SpaceX</p>
<p>and launching rockets into space?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s all good because you could say,</p>
<p>hey, we could just feed everybody.</p>
<p>And I was like, yeah, that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>By the way, these guys give a ton of money</p>
<p>to philanthropy shit that nobody cares about.</p>
<p>By the way, it&rsquo;s weird.</p>
<p>He could feed Nigeria with pocket change of his.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re like, well, maybe he has.</p>
<p>I heard Bill Gates gave back so much money</p>
<p>he saved 6 million lives.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s a reverse Holocaust, by the way.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s pretty good.</p>
<p>What have you done?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a barista.</p>
<p>So I just think space travel is good</p>
<p>because you learn about the place you&rsquo;re living in</p>
<p>from going to space.</p>
<p>It kind of helps you learn about this more.</p>
<p>You could say, what&rsquo;s the point of going to this other there?</p>
<p>But it does help, I think.</p>
<p>Yeah, doing difficult things in the engineering space</p>
<p>seems to be a way to develop as almost like an accident,</p>
<p>as a side effect of doing a really difficult thing</p>
<p>in a team of brilliant people.</p>
<p>You develop things like the internet.</p>
<p>And you could argue that the internet</p>
<p>maybe is not so good for society.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m just kidding.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s good and bad.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s like a pull up.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re trying to get your bicep going,</p>
<p>but hey, before you know it, you got decent forearms.</p>
<p>But you weren&rsquo;t working on the forearms,</p>
<p>you wanted to buy, but you got the fore.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s kind of what space travel is.</p>
<p>I like how this pivoted into a workout routine advice.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to get an analogy going here.</p>
<p>All right, they work pretty well.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll take it.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts about, since I&rsquo;m a robotics person,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be curious to see, do you think about the space at all?</p>
<p>About, first of all, autonomous vehicles</p>
<p>with Tesla Autopilot and Waymo self driving car.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if you&rsquo;re familiar</p>
<p>with all the autonomous vehicles and so on.</p>
<p>So those are robots on wheels.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s also legged robots.</p>
<p>So next time you&rsquo;re in Austin,</p>
<p>you get to meet some of the legged robots.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve been working on.</p>
<p>And I find those kind of a fascinating way</p>
<p>to explore the nature of intelligence in our computers,</p>
<p>but also explore our own intelligence</p>
<p>and also explore our own,</p>
<p>like what makes us connect to other living beings,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s dogs, cats, or other humans.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s some magic there</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s beyond just intelligence.</p>
<p>And I, like when I have the robot dog,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some aspect to it that, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>brings me joy in a way that a dog does,</p>
<p>in a way that a good friend does.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not sure if that&rsquo;s some kind of anthropomorphism,</p>
<p>like where I&rsquo;m projecting my hopes for this,</p>
<p>what this thing is, but it&rsquo;s kind of built in.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s just a source of joy.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s connected to the fact</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s just like a loneliness</p>
<p>within all of us, within me.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just nice to have other things in your life</p>
<p>that move, that recognize you, that kind of thing.</p>
<p>I mean, I suppose it&rsquo;s nice to even just have a plant.</p>
<p>Yeah, it is.</p>
<p>Plant goes a long way.</p>
<p>You see a guy with plants in his apartment,</p>
<p>it changes the apartment because they&rsquo;re alive.</p>
<p>You gotta water them.</p>
<p>You gotta put sun on them.</p>
<p>So yeah, I think there&rsquo;s something there.</p>
<p>And I think you can see people&rsquo;s reactions</p>
<p>when you show them advanced technology,</p>
<p>like these dog robots or these robots that dance and shit.</p>
<p>People are like, what the fuck?</p>
<p>Like it hits home in some way, whether it&rsquo;s fear</p>
<p>or you wanna fuck them clearly, whatever it is,</p>
<p>but it does connect with you in some way.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m with you.</p>
<p>And I think this is why I don&rsquo;t think robots will take over.</p>
<p>You always hear that robot, they&rsquo;re making them too advanced.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re gonna wipe us out, blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p>If robots get at human emotions, that is scary</p>
<p>because they could get mad at us and kill us</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re stronger and they don&rsquo;t need sleep.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t need food.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t need water.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t get jealous.</p>
<p>But if they have emotions,</p>
<p>then I think we can dominate them</p>
<p>because who knows emotions better than us?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got thousands of years</p>
<p>of evolutionary emotional bullshit.</p>
<p>We can go, hey robot, I heard your wife</p>
<p>fucked that black and Decker, huh?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re gonna crumble.</p>
<p>We can bully them.</p>
<p>Emotionally manipulate robots.</p>
<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s when we&rsquo;ll win.</p>
<p>Right now, they could kill us.</p>
<p>They could just, we&rsquo;d all die.</p>
<p>Then we shoot them back, bing, bing, bing, bing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s no good.</p>
<p>But if they do get emotions, then we can go,</p>
<p>hey, you look like hell.</p>
<p>What is that, a rusty bolt?</p>
<p>Hey, you&rsquo;re dropping some oil there, you loser.</p>
<p>I think we can win if they do get emotions.</p>
<p>This goes back to your father being able</p>
<p>to undercut you with a single word.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>Yeah, so we&rsquo;re the creators of the robots</p>
<p>and then the robots will just,</p>
<p>you would say the exact thing</p>
<p>where the robot would be like, that son of a bitch.</p>
<p>And then it goes back to his hole</p>
<p>and just sits there miserable.</p>
<p>Right, yeah, hardware looks more like software to me.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t get it up, yada, yada, yada.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m not worried about robots</p>
<p>and I think self, what do you think</p>
<p>about the self driving cars?</p>
<p>Is that just wiping out the horse and buggy?</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t that just progression of technology?</p>
<p>Yeah, so I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ve driven in a Tesla,</p>
<p>for example.</p>
<p>I have, I rode in the passenger, I just drive it.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s several stages in that.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s the problem is way harder than people realize.</p>
<p>And for quite a while,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll just make driving more pleasant.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll make it less stressful.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll take over some of the boring bits for you</p>
<p>and make it easier.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s something that happens actually</p>
<p>when the car is driving for you in the following way.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s staying in the lane,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s keeping distance to the car in front of you.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s changing lanes.</p>
<p>It allows you to relax a little bit.</p>
<p>Like you become, you still have to be alert,</p>
<p>but you become like a passenger</p>
<p>and you get to like take in the world.</p>
<p>I mean, somehow that&rsquo;s more relaxing</p>
<p>without making you necessarily like bored more.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s energizing more.</p>
<p>So I just think it makes the driving experience</p>
<p>more pleasant.</p>
<p>But when you actually fully automate cars,</p>
<p>when you can just completely tune out</p>
<p>and start reading a book or go to sleep,</p>
<p>that might change society like in ways</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t even understand.</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;ll have, I mean the,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll probably change the nature of roads</p>
<p>because the cars, because now you can be super productive.</p>
<p>And so no longer quite matters to you</p>
<p>as much how long it takes to get from point A to point B</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re not wasting that time.</p>
<p>You just continue working.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like public transit that comes to you.</p>
<p>And so there will be maybe less roads and bigger roads</p>
<p>and it will just change the nature of how we get</p>
<p>from point A to point B.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>But then couple that also with the fact</p>
<p>that we seem to be more and more comfortable</p>
<p>existing in the digital world.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So like maybe we won&rsquo;t want to go outside more and more.</p>
<p>We will just interact with each other virtually.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t mean Zoom meetings.</p>
<p>I mean, just in other ways that&rsquo;s more fulfilling</p>
<p>than a Zoom meeting, but then maybe not</p>
<p>because like there&rsquo;s something deeply uncompelling</p>
<p>about Zoom meetings.</p>
<p>Like podcasts that are remote,</p>
<p>unless they&rsquo;re super information dense,</p>
<p>at least to me as a podcast fan, kind of suck.</p>
<p>They suck.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no connection.</p>
<p>It goes back to the dog thing.</p>
<p>With the Zoom, there&rsquo;s no connection.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re not, you know, I don&rsquo;t understand why</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not even making eye contact.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s something there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s in the room.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s pheromones.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s like out of our understanding probably.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just some kind of weird biological,</p>
<p>you know, you ever have Cheerios in a bowl?</p>
<p>The Cheerios tend to, they tend to go together.</p>
<p>You see a cluster of Cheerios.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re never really hanging out on the other side.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s kind of how people are in real life.</p>
<p>I wonder what the physics of that is.</p>
<p>So they come together and they stick.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so many with molecules.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, I can&rsquo;t remember what it was,</p>
<p>but it was fascinating.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s how people are.</p>
<p>And I think you try to write a TV show</p>
<p>or craft a movie with your team, Zoom, nothing there.</p>
<p>Nothing there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like phone sex versus penetration.</p>
<p>One day you&rsquo;ll learn that.</p>
<p>I know nothing of either of the,</p>
<p>I look forward,</p>
<p>because I think there&rsquo;s a phone sex Netflix documentary</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a show or something like that</p>
<p>that is really popular that I want to go watch.</p>
<p>So at least I can learn about that.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I could send you some links.</p>
<p>Like really.</p>
<p>Oh, on the internet?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But yeah, self driving car.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s just inevitable.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s coming and these truckers</p>
<p>are going to have to figure something out.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s an under understood industry actually,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s not,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of trucking jobs and people don&rsquo;t want to,</p>
<p>well, people don&rsquo;t want to actually take them anymore</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s such a difficult job.</p>
<p>So it won&rsquo;t have,</p>
<p>or a lot of people believe it won&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>as big of a negative impact as folks anticipate.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;ll be other automation.</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;ll have a huge impact.</p>
<p>Yeah, for sure.</p>
<p>I mean, you already see it in McDonald&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>You go to the beep, beep, beep.</p>
<p>Why do you want to get yelled at</p>
<p>by the heavyset woman of color,</p>
<p>you know, for making a bad order</p>
<p>when you can just, you know, hit the screen?</p>
<p>But those interactions I think are human.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s part of life.</p>
<p>So it is scary taking away everything.</p>
<p>How long till we&rsquo;re not fucking?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s coming too.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s going to have two types of people.</p>
<p>Are you a fuck in real life?</p>
<p>Are you a digital fuck person?</p>
<p>Oh, I&rsquo;m a digital.</p>
<p>Oh, I like real fucking.</p>
<p>Sorry, we can&rsquo;t date.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s coming.</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s also the reproduction side of sex,</p>
<p>which is like with genetic engineering,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll be able to specify a little bit of details.</p>
<p>I talked to Jamie Mertzel about that.</p>
<p>Like where you can specify like,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll start with like,</p>
<p>I want my child not to have like a high likelihood</p>
<p>of diabetes or something like that.</p>
<p>And then you just get to specify like intelligence.</p>
<p>You just get to specify those kinds of parameters</p>
<p>until you&rsquo;re like basically trying to create a perfect human</p>
<p>and you lose some of the magic of the flaws</p>
<p>that make us who we are.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And you know, I&rsquo;m pretty sure in the full lineup of humans,</p>
<p>like, so let me give you some information.</p>
<p>Lay it off me, buddy.</p>
<p>Break it down.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure you researched this thoroughly,</p>
<p>but a male of the human species,</p>
<p>the homo sapien produces 500 billion sperm cells</p>
<p>in a lifetime.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s all, some more than others.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all uniquely, genetically unique humans</p>
<p>that you could produce.</p>
<p>So even across those 500 billion, you can select.</p>
<p>And so.</p>
<p>What do you mean, like abort some or?</p>
<p>No, you can choose which of them you want.</p>
<p>I mean, just imagine all the genetic possibilities</p>
<p>that are there, like all of the possible,</p>
<p>like you won the race.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Shocking.</p>
<p>Yeah, this is the winner.</p>
<p>Which one out of all the 500 billion?</p>
<p>You have to imagine what the competition was.</p>
<p>Oh, just tarts all day long.</p>
<p>Handicap.</p>
<p>Well, so it&rsquo;s not actually the fastest sperm</p>
<p>or like it&rsquo;s, I think a lot of it is timing and luck.</p>
<p>Ah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what it seems like.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s actual papers on this</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve actually been reading them.</p>
<p>I hope so.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not just like the fastest sperm to the egg.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a timing thing.</p>
<p>So you were just lucky.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>I believe that.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s interesting to think about like,</p>
<p>once you&rsquo;re able to specify some parameters</p>
<p>of what your child is like,</p>
<p>how that changes the nature of</p>
<p>even just like the intimacy of two humans getting together</p>
<p>and making, creating together a child.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, it changes it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>it becomes like a factory line of some kind.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t meet naturally.</p>
<p>Yeah, if you don&rsquo;t meet naturally and then you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>and you get to optimize your child,</p>
<p>then it&rsquo;s some like you have to consider</p>
<p>utilitarian type of things,</p>
<p>like what&rsquo;s good for society</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;ll probably be regulation about what kind of children</p>
<p>you can have or not.</p>
<p>Like your child can not have an IQ below this</p>
<p>or above this or something like that.</p>
<p>Or your child can not.</p>
<p>We already kind of do that with VIP clubs.</p>
<p>Like, ah, you&rsquo;re kind of ugly</p>
<p>or women go, hey, he&rsquo;s not tall enough.</p>
<p>We kind of do it a little.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Especially sexually.</p>
<p>Yeah, we do.</p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t get on the roller coaster</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re this short, whatever it is.</p>
<p>You know, we do it in some capacity.</p>
<p>But here, this would be like fully transparent</p>
<p>and to a degree that it&rsquo;s hard to imagine.</p>
<p>Like the way we currently do it,</p>
<p>you can at least get around it.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>You can at least trick your way onto the roller coaster</p>
<p>even if you&rsquo;re short.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Or the fat guy can get rich so he can get laid.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s other ways.</p>
<p>At the risk of asking the totally wrong person</p>
<p>this question, what advice would you give</p>
<p>to young people today in high school and college</p>
<p>about how to have a successful career</p>
<p>or career they&rsquo;re proud of</p>
<p>or maybe have a life that they&rsquo;re proud of?</p>
<p>Ooh.</p>
<p>Well, first of all, you gotta be,</p>
<p>you gotta want a life you&rsquo;re proud of.</p>
<p>Not everybody has any integrity.</p>
<p>A lot of people just want short money.</p>
<p>I wanna feel good, look good right now.</p>
<p>I wanna do Molly, boom, I&rsquo;ll feel good, you know?</p>
<p>But you should space it out.</p>
<p>You should, it&rsquo;s almost like saving money</p>
<p>so you can use it later.</p>
<p>Nobody wants to save money.</p>
<p>What do they say, like 11% of America</p>
<p>actually has money saved, $1,000 or some shit?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s wildly low.</p>
<p>Everybody wants it now, now, what do you call it?</p>
<p>Immediate gratification.</p>
<p>I think the key to happiness and satisfaction</p>
<p>is working for something.</p>
<p>Even if it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s like a baby.</p>
<p>If you could have a baby in five minutes,</p>
<p>if a woman, you got a, you jizzed in her</p>
<p>and she had a baby, oop, five minutes, boom.</p>
<p>Newborn, healthy.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;d be more likely to throw it away</p>
<p>if you could make it that quick.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the fact that you spent nine months backbreaking</p>
<p>the labor, the lactating, the ripped placenta</p>
<p>and the hymen or whatever the fuck.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what makes you love it.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s the same with comedy</p>
<p>or making money or whatever.</p>
<p>Look at these kids who like child stars.</p>
<p>They all become heroin addicts at like 22</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;ve just, their sensors are burned out.</p>
<p>Their pleasure sensors.</p>
<p>You didn&rsquo;t have to earn it.</p>
<p>I think earning it is a big part of life</p>
<p>and always try to do better, try to do more,</p>
<p>try to learn new things.</p>
<p>Hey, I&rsquo;m bored.</p>
<p>Life sucks.</p>
<p>Play the piano then you chooch.</p>
<p>But you won&rsquo;t do it because it takes effort</p>
<p>and failure and all that.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s the good part.</p>
<p>And I know it&rsquo;s hard to see.</p>
<p>So I think that&rsquo;s a good key to life</p>
<p>is work hard at something you care about</p>
<p>and then love the result.</p>
<p>The hard work, the journey is actually way more important</p>
<p>than just getting something.</p>
<p>Everybody wants to go on Amazon.</p>
<p>I got a package.</p>
<p>Then you feel good for 10 seconds</p>
<p>and all right, let&rsquo;s go on Amazon again.</p>
<p>And then it&rsquo;s just a dumb cycle</p>
<p>of you being disgusting and gluttonous.</p>
<p>So work for it.</p>
<p>Everybody wants to take steroids and just boop, I&rsquo;m buff.</p>
<p>Why&rsquo;d you point at me?</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m just saying.</p>
<p>Because I&rsquo;m Russian or what?</p>
<p>Well, I saw the Icarus.</p>
<p>But no, I&rsquo;m not saying you&rsquo;re on roids.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just, you&rsquo;d be way bigger.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m just saying, you know, work for something.</p>
<p>And then I would also, young people eat shit early.</p>
<p>Eat shit early.</p>
<p>I know a guy who kind of got canceled or whatever</p>
<p>and he had an out early, but he tried to get by</p>
<p>and he tried to ride it and it all came crumbling down.</p>
<p>But if he had eaten it early, like, yeah, I fucked up.</p>
<p>I did that.</p>
<p>Whatever it was, he would&rsquo;ve just kind of been shit on</p>
<p>for a month and then it would&rsquo;ve gone away.</p>
<p>But now it&rsquo;s his whole identity and that sucks.</p>
<p>So eat shit early.</p>
<p>And I know it&rsquo;s hard to see, what do you mean early?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in the present.</p>
<p>But look ahead, look back, this time will pass.</p>
<p>I mean, look at high school.</p>
<p>High school was the biggest thing in our lives.</p>
<p>Oh my God, this exam, Susie Q hates me.</p>
<p>The football player beat me up.</p>
<p>Oh, I&rsquo;ll never recover.</p>
<p>Now you don&rsquo;t even think about high school.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a blip in your dumb life, you know?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what this is now.</p>
<p>This will just be a blip.</p>
<p>So remember that and work towards something</p>
<p>and work hard and care about the result.</p>
<p>If the result isn&rsquo;t good, try it again.</p>
<p>And failure is not always bad.</p>
<p>Failure, we look at failure as this end all, be all.</p>
<p>My life&rsquo;s over, I failed.</p>
<p>But failure is really just learning.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s something.</p>
<p>So in summary, eat shit early and eat shit often.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>All right, Mark Norman.</p>
<p>Eat ass.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s escalated quickly.</p>
<p>All right, I have a list of random questions for you.</p>
<p>What activities make you lose track of time?</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Have that go into that zone.</p>
<p>You have this happiness, contentment about you</p>
<p>that you just truly enjoy.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think a good conversation.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;ll sit at the comedy cellar with friends,</p>
<p>maybe a little whiskey&rsquo;s flowing.</p>
<p>And when you&rsquo;re really just vibing</p>
<p>and inhibiting.</p>
<p>You can do it.</p>
<p>What is it?</p>
<p>Inhibited. Inhibited.</p>
<p>Uninhibited. Uninhibited.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re just vibing and you&rsquo;re uninhibited</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re saying crazy shit and you&rsquo;re laughing</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re not worried, am I seeming cool right now?</p>
<p>Am I seeming likable?</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re just you 100% and it&rsquo;s all coming out of you</p>
<p>and then they&rsquo;re saying stuff and you go back and forth</p>
<p>and you feel that excitement.</p>
<p>Oh, they&rsquo;re talking, but I wanna say my thing.</p>
<p>And you get all peed up.</p>
<p>I love that.</p>
<p>And I look at my watch, I&rsquo;m like, fuck,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s three in the morning.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been talking for five hours.</p>
<p>So I love that.</p>
<p>That makes the time fly by.</p>
<p>Also, I bought a, speaking of self driving cars,</p>
<p>I bought a 1973 BMW car and it&rsquo;s classic</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s stick shift and it&rsquo;s grizzly and gritty and rusty</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a bucket of bolts, but I love driving it.</p>
<p>Bucket of bolts.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You and Tom Waits are poets.</p>
<p>Have you taken like a long trip anywhere,</p>
<p>like road trip in your life or with this BMW?</p>
<p>Not with it, it&rsquo;s pretty new,</p>
<p>but I will.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a new 97.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s new to me.</p>
<p>And it goes in the phase of everything we&rsquo;re doing now.</p>
<p>Everything is digital, everything is automated,</p>
<p>everything is hands off, everything is delivered.</p>
<p>And this is the most hands on thing in the world.</p>
<p>And I am dialed in, man.</p>
<p>I got the tachometer, I keep an eye on that.</p>
<p>Oh, I put the wrong gear in, shit.</p>
<p>Oh, it&rsquo;s about to stall, put some gas, put some clutch.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s all just brain power and staying in focus</p>
<p>and all that, and it&rsquo;s the opposite of tweeting</p>
<p>and texting and watching porn or whatever.</p>
<p>So I almost needed that in my life,</p>
<p>so I bought this car just to have this little exercise.</p>
<p>I hope you don&rsquo;t mind that I&rsquo;m just trying out</p>
<p>random questions I wrote on you that are completely insane.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a guinea pig, jizz in my face.</p>
<p>Bring it on, baby.</p>
<p>This would be edited down to five minutes.</p>
<p>If everyone on earth disappeared</p>
<p>and it was just you left, what would your days look like?</p>
<p>What would you do?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s tough, because I&rsquo;m already an introvert</p>
<p>and I try to avoid people mostly.</p>
<p>Like I like a one on one, but crowds and all that is tough.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>So basically unchanged?</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s what I was gonna say,</p>
<p>but then that&rsquo;s the irony is I would be so sad</p>
<p>to not talk to anybody.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s this weird, bittersweet thing,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t know what I would do, man.</p>
<p>I guess it&rsquo;s kind of like when you&rsquo;re hung over,</p>
<p>you just go into the primal survival mode.</p>
<p>I gotta get food, I need water, I&rsquo;m horny, jerk off.</p>
<p>You just go, you&rsquo;re not like playing the piano</p>
<p>or painting or at the gym.</p>
<p>So I think I would just go into urges, man, primal urges.</p>
<p>Find food, store food, am I safe?</p>
<p>Make weapons, build a shelter that I can&rsquo;t get attacked in.</p>
<p>I would go all survival mode.</p>
<p>And then once I maybe realized if I was safe or not,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no wild roaming dogs, I would start exploring.</p>
<p>And maybe somehow get a vehicle and I would try to expand</p>
<p>and that would be it.</p>
<p>And maybe I&rsquo;d journal.</p>
<p>Exploring to what, to try to find new experiences?</p>
<p>New life, if there&rsquo;s other,</p>
<p>maybe there is another guy out there.</p>
<p>Oh, so always there&rsquo;s a possibility.</p>
<p>Yeah, hope.</p>
<p>Hope.</p>
<p>And then maybe there&rsquo;s a better place I could live.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s find that and then moving on.</p>
<p>Maybe there&rsquo;s more food over here.</p>
<p>So yeah, the hope would drive me.</p>
<p>But it would be bleak and sad and horrible also.</p>
<p>So what you&rsquo;re saying is you really want other people</p>
<p>to be there so you can hide from them, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>Yes, yes, well said.</p>
<p>All right, what&rsquo;s an item on your bucket list</p>
<p>that you haven&rsquo;t done yet?</p>
<p>Think about something you&rsquo;d be very upset if you died</p>
<p>and you haven&rsquo;t done.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m terrified of having kids,</p>
<p>just because I&rsquo;m a child myself</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m selfish and lazy in a way.</p>
<p>So kids are like, this is your whole life now, this is it.</p>
<p>You gotta not let this thing die.</p>
<p>You gotta love it, you gotta raise it.</p>
<p>So kids scare the shit out of me,</p>
<p>but I also feel like if I don&rsquo;t have them, I&rsquo;ll regret it.</p>
<p>Well, you&rsquo;ve seen so many people like you</p>
<p>who are fundamentally changed by kids.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s a source, it&rsquo;s a source of,</p>
<p>like a deep source of happiness,</p>
<p>even though you didn&rsquo;t anticipate it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So you like, you penciled it into your bucket list.</p>
<p>Yes, yes.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re, it might be on there.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>You want kids?</p>
<p>Yeah, well, I want kids.</p>
<p>I wanna get married, I wanna have kids.</p>
<p>I kind of, I don&rsquo;t like choice.</p>
<p>So in the following way,</p>
<p>like I appreciate the value of scarcity</p>
<p>and the power of scarcity.</p>
<p>Like I don&rsquo;t like the modern dating culture.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not some religious thing or whatever.</p>
<p>I just like one girl for a long time</p>
<p>or at least swinging for that always,</p>
<p>like swinging for the fences.</p>
<p>You could be swinging right now.</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;re.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a different use of the word swinging.</p>
<p>Sure, sure.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m saying, you could be clear.</p>
<p>You look great, you&rsquo;re handsome.</p>
<p>Yeah, thank you.</p>
<p>Muscular.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>You get the job done.</p>
<p>So I feel like you wouldn&rsquo;t leave without an orgasm on her.</p>
<p>Yeah, but I just like to, you know, about furries.</p>
<p>I like to dress up as animals</p>
<p>and I just have trouble finding others who like the same.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re up there.</p>
<p>I could show you some chat rooms.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re also my coach for the internet.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>What are you most afraid of?</p>
<p>I guess on Unlived Life.</p>
<p>I was a big fan growing up of like wild guys, you know,</p>
<p>like these Teddy Roosevelt&rsquo;s who would go out</p>
<p>and hunt lions and like bar fighting guys.</p>
<p>I was obsessed with the Hunter S. Thompson types.</p>
<p>And look, this is what I love about guys like,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s a good example?</p>
<p>Like Hemingway.</p>
<p>Hemingway was the manliest guy.</p>
<p>He had the rifle and the elephant gun and the whiskey</p>
<p>and the writing and the women and the fist fights.</p>
<p>But people forget that the other side of that coin</p>
<p>is I&rsquo;m sure he was in a lot of hotel rooms weeping.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure he was lonely as fuck.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure he had some wicked hangovers.</p>
<p>I mean, he killed himself for Christ&rsquo;s sake.</p>
<p>So obviously he was dealing with something.</p>
<p>So the key to me is having this adventurous life,</p>
<p>living to the fullest, doing crazy shit, scaring yourself,</p>
<p>but also not killing yourself.</p>
<p>Like also not hating,</p>
<p>because I used to party a lot hard.</p>
<p>I used to bang a lot of gals.</p>
<p>And the flip side is like, this girl hates you now,</p>
<p>or you got herpes or you&rsquo;re hungover,</p>
<p>or your mom is like, where are you?</p>
<p>You never call me anymore.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like, oh, my mom, let ties go with my mom.</p>
<p>I gotta connect.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a horrible side to the party animal.</p>
<p>The Keith Richards we don&rsquo;t see is not pretty.</p>
<p>I mean, he&rsquo;s already weird looking,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s partying, he&rsquo;s smoking, he&rsquo;s living.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s another side of that coin.</p>
<p>And I think the key to life</p>
<p>is living that fucking crazy, awesome, badass life,</p>
<p>and also having some meaning</p>
<p>and a little bit of, what&rsquo;s the word?</p>
<p>Not just not killing yourself,</p>
<p>not going sad, not being depressed.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a medium there, a sweet spot.</p>
<p>Does that make sense?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>So taking big leaps and Hemingway,</p>
<p>grabbing life by the balls,</p>
<p>but at the same time, not crushing the balls,</p>
<p>does that metaphor work at all?</p>
<p>Perfect, like Evel Knievel, we all know him.</p>
<p>What a badass, fearless, oh, man, what a cool dude.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s got balls of steel.</p>
<p>But he also lived the back half of his life</p>
<p>in a fucking barka lounger</p>
<p>where his legs were made of steel</p>
<p>and he couldn&rsquo;t see straight and his dick didn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>So you know what I mean?</p>
<p>You gotta have a balance, but you still want the balance.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m willing to take a little bit of shit</p>
<p>for a little bit of fun,</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t want to go too hard.</p>
<p>Well, you gotta still risk it.</p>
<p>I mean, Hunter S. Thompson, it didn&rsquo;t end well.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But it was quite a ride.</p>
<p>Quite a ride.</p>
<p>What small act of kindness were you once shown</p>
<p>that you will never forget?</p>
<p>Wow, that&rsquo;s a great question.</p>
<p>I just wrote these for the guinea pig.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re the guinea pig.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s great, that&rsquo;s a keeper.</p>
<p>Keep that question. Okay, that&rsquo;s a keeper?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>This is where we&rsquo;re like workshopping questions here.</p>
<p>All right, I&rsquo;ll take it.</p>
<p>Now you&rsquo;re open biking.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>This is your version.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see, there&rsquo;s a couple ladies in high school</p>
<p>who were kind enough to hand job me.</p>
<p>That was nice, which I really appreciate.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think women know how much that means to us.</p>
<p>You know, women are like,</p>
<p>oh, I&rsquo;m not a piece of meat or whatever.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re like, I know, but if you just gave me a hand job,</p>
<p>it would make my world.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like telling a kid he&rsquo;s smart or loved.</p>
<p>See, most people mention like a math teacher,</p>
<p>middle school, that would inspire them to get into science.</p>
<p>You give a shout out to the thing.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s part of it, that&rsquo;s not the nicest,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m just saying that goes a long way.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see, kindness.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a great question.</p>
<p>I wanna give you a good answer.</p>
<p>I got lost when I was like six.</p>
<p>I was walking around my dad and I zoned out and went away.</p>
<p>And next thing you know, I don&rsquo;t know where I am.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in a neighborhood.</p>
<p>This old guy finds me crying on a lawn somewhere</p>
<p>and he goes, come inside.</p>
<p>And he tried to call my parents and nothing came of it.</p>
<p>Eventually they found me after like nine hours,</p>
<p>cops were there, the FBI is out there, fucking helicopters.</p>
<p>And I guess, you know, that&rsquo;s nice.</p>
<p>This old guy took me in for a couple of hours</p>
<p>and just sat me down and kept me safe.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s something.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Oh, how about Enis?</p>
<p>My transvestite nanny, very kind.</p>
<p>He, did you hear about this?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>We had this transvestite nanny who was like a drag queen,</p>
<p>but it was in the 90s.</p>
<p>So it was weird.</p>
<p>It was new.</p>
<p>And my bike got stolen and he, you know,</p>
<p>my parents were like, eh, what are you gonna do?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re poor kids, you know?</p>
<p>And he was like, fuck it, we&rsquo;re gonna go get that bike.</p>
<p>And I was like, this guy&rsquo;s in a wig and high heels,</p>
<p>big black guy.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, ah, what are you gonna do?</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s gone.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, nah, we&rsquo;re gonna go get it.</p>
<p>So we got in the van and drove around my neighborhood,</p>
<p>saw the kids, fuck with the bike, you know,</p>
<p>five street tufts.</p>
<p>And he goes, all right, you want to come out</p>
<p>or should I just do this?</p>
<p>And I was like, you do it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m terrified.</p>
<p>What are you, crazy?</p>
<p>And he got out of the van in full, you know,</p>
<p>heels and wig.</p>
<p>And he went up to these guys and they went off.</p>
<p>Oh my God, look at this fucking guy,</p>
<p>homo faggot, all this shit.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s the 90s.</p>
<p>And he just stared at them long enough</p>
<p>to where they were kind of like, all right,</p>
<p>well, I guess we&rsquo;re gonna fight you now.</p>
<p>And he goes, that&rsquo;s not your bike.</p>
<p>And they go, what are you gonna do about it?</p>
<p>And he puts his hand on the middle of the bike</p>
<p>and they didn&rsquo;t do anything.</p>
<p>And he just picked it up and said, that&rsquo;s what I thought.</p>
<p>Put the bike over his shoulder, slid the van door open,</p>
<p>threw the bike in and we drove off.</p>
<p>Somebody stuck up for you.</p>
<p>Yeah, and you know, I mean, he could have got,</p>
<p>I mean, they had tools.</p>
<p>They could have fucking tuned him up, two seconds.</p>
<p>That actually like takes courage.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, real courage.</p>
<p>And then that, the reason you do an act like that</p>
<p>is that makes a kid like you feel like</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s somebody on your side, that&rsquo;s powerful.</p>
<p>Someone on your side is big.</p>
<p>Is big.</p>
<p>That goes a long way.</p>
<p>Especially when they have the risk</p>
<p>of getting their ass kicked or their job taken away</p>
<p>or whatever it is.</p>
<p>Now we&rsquo;re gonna get philosophical,</p>
<p>maybe a little bit emotional.</p>
<p>Oh, would you rather lose all your old memories</p>
<p>or never be able to make new ones?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a tough one, but I&rsquo;d go easy answer, make new ones.</p>
<p>But don&rsquo;t you think all the shitty things</p>
<p>that happen to you?</p>
<p>Oh, so my hard drive is wiped clean.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not, is it memories</p>
<p>or is it how every memory affected me too?</p>
<p>I mean, this is a very.</p>
<p>Or do they go hand in hand?</p>
<p>I think the reality about memories</p>
<p>is you replay them often.</p>
<p>You go back to them even when you&rsquo;re not aware of it.</p>
<p>You really go, you go back often like that.</p>
<p>And they change.</p>
<p>You change them too.</p>
<p>Yeah, you change them to suit your understanding</p>
<p>of the world.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And so the dark view you have,</p>
<p>both the hope and the cynicism you have about the world</p>
<p>is so deeply grounded in the memories</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re basically, I would say,</p>
<p>if you erase all memories,</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re really starting over</p>
<p>with maybe the wisdom of how the world works,</p>
<p>but not so much of your personality is gone.</p>
<p>You would really,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;d be interesting how your comedy would change.</p>
<p>Maybe you would have a good sense of timing.</p>
<p>You have a good sense of the writing process maybe.</p>
<p>But like.</p>
<p>Now you&rsquo;re making some good points,</p>
<p>but let me ask you this.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say I go to Lake Cuomo with my girlfriend.</p>
<p>Now, like I wipe the memory or I keep my old memories.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say I go to the Tuscany with the lady.</p>
<p>I just won&rsquo;t remember that?</p>
<p>Yeah, but you get to experience it in the moment.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll get to enjoy it.</p>
<p>Can I look at a photo of it?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>But I would, what the hell is this?</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>Oh, fascinating.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s exact.</p>
<p>The rules are pretty simple.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I think everyone knows how the rules go.</p>
<p>So you would, yeah, so what?</p>
<p>Well, I was gonna say start new ones,</p>
<p>but then I realized I wouldn&rsquo;t be who I was without them.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re saying.</p>
<p>So I guess I&rsquo;d keep them.</p>
<p>Cause I am 38, so I&rsquo;ve gotten a good chunk out of life.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s be honest, how many years do you have left?</p>
<p>I know, right?</p>
<p>I got AIDS.</p>
<p>Is it better to have loved,</p>
<p>okay, this question is ridiculous.</p>
<p>Is it better to have loved than lost</p>
<p>or to have never loved at all?</p>
<p>It sounds cliche, but there&rsquo;s a question.</p>
<p>Definitely better to loss.</p>
<p>So you enjoy the ups and downs.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re sun and rain, baby.</p>
<p>I kind of like both, the whole thing.</p>
<p>The loss, every time you lose something,</p>
<p>it really makes you distinctly realize</p>
<p>how much you valued it.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Like when I&rsquo;m feeling alone and I&rsquo;m sitting there alone</p>
<p>at home and I wish I could hang out with somebody,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like a realization how awesome people are.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like the missing, yeah.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have a lot of that in life anymore</p>
<p>because we can have anything we want immediately.</p>
<p>So the missing has gone away,</p>
<p>which again drives down the joy of having it.</p>
<p>So I think you&rsquo;re right, you need both.</p>
<p>So like you said, you have a terminal condition,</p>
<p>not many years left.</p>
<p>Do you think about your mortality?</p>
<p>You think about that?</p>
<p>All day, every day.</p>
<p>Are you afraid?</p>
<p>Not afraid, because it&rsquo;s inevitable.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s more like, how are we gonna handle this?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the winter is coming,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s stock up on some fucking nuts.</p>
<p>But the existential nature of it,</p>
<p>like the fact that this ride ends,</p>
<p>like what the hell are you doing any of this for?</p>
<p>Like, is it your?</p>
<p>Satisfaction, happiness.</p>
<p>Short term, but like there is a presumption there</p>
<p>that it kind of goes on forever.</p>
<p>I think if you truly think about the fact that it ends.</p>
<p>Your brain almost shuts it down.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s some kind of like protective like switch</p>
<p>that just goes off.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s why the Stoics encourage people</p>
<p>to meditate on death,</p>
<p>because it somehow reorganizes your priorities.</p>
<p>It helps you like, holy shit,</p>
<p>this ends, make the most of the day.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a nice thing,</p>
<p>but still you can&rsquo;t quite comprehend that the thing ends.</p>
<p>Little things too.</p>
<p>People go like, oh, we got a layover between our flights.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an hour, what are we gonna do for an hour?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, what do you mean,</p>
<p>what are you gonna do for an hour?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna kill an hour.</p>
<p>How are we gonna kill this hour?</p>
<p>This is part of your life.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just trying to get rid of it,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just trying to kill it.</p>
<p>That always blew my mind.</p>
<p>Like, hey, fuck it, let&rsquo;s go hit the airport bar.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s get a candy bar or something, anything with bar.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s just, you&rsquo;ve gotta live.</p>
<p>I hate this like, how are we gonna burn?</p>
<p>Oh, the bar didn&rsquo;t open for 15 minutes.</p>
<p>What are we gonna do?</p>
<p>Well, we got 15 minutes.</p>
<p>The world is our oyster.</p>
<p>Yeah, make the most of it.</p>
<p>And like you said, in modern day,</p>
<p>actually the boredom is a gift.</p>
<p>Like when you&rsquo;re waiting for something, that&rsquo;s a gift.</p>
<p>You get to be with your thoughts.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Those are the same thoughts you&rsquo;ll have</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re on your deathbed.</p>
<p>There won&rsquo;t be a, you won&rsquo;t be scrolling TikTok</p>
<p>on your deathbed.</p>
<p>I hope not, Jesus.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d be a lot more, actually maybe you would be.</p>
<p>What a sad existence.</p>
<p>Because it would be a good,</p>
<p>like content creators would be like,</p>
<p>ooh, I&rsquo;m dying, this would be good content.</p>
<p>Yeah, I wanna be able to sure,</p>
<p>film the exact moment it goes, beep.</p>
<p>Like last words, I wonder what my last words will be.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d be a good way to like end the account with a bang.</p>
<p>Yep, I like that.</p>
<p>Well, you know that you ever seen that meme</p>
<p>where the old guy in bed, he goes,</p>
<p>I wish I had tweeted more, you know, and then he dies.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so true.</p>
<p>Could be the future.</p>
<p>What do you think is the meaning of life?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there is one.</p>
<p>Everybody always throws that out there.</p>
<p>There isn&rsquo;t a meaning.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re here, we&rsquo;re lucky to be here.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s no afterlife, there&rsquo;s no heaven.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all shit we tell ourselves to feel better.</p>
<p>And I think you gotta just, it&rsquo;s like saying,</p>
<p>what is the meaning of this food I made?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s just you enjoy the food,</p>
<p>you try to get the most out of it.</p>
<p>You built the food, you prepared it.</p>
<p>So just get what you can out of it.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t die and try to make it last as long as possible.</p>
<p>Yeah, but you look at Earth,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like 4 billion years old.</p>
<p>And life started early on, like simple cell bacteria life,</p>
<p>like 1 billion years in.</p>
<p>And then it started like having lots</p>
<p>of aggressive interaction.</p>
<p>Eventually there&rsquo;s predator and prey and there&rsquo;s sex,</p>
<p>lots of sex, lots of sex, lots of violence.</p>
<p>Oh yeah.</p>
<p>And then, you know, through natural selection,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s just the whole evolutionary process of animals</p>
<p>that have loved and lost and murdered and gotten murdered</p>
<p>and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s somehow led to human civilization.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re super busy trying to create things</p>
<p>and creating beautiful art, creating beautiful comedy.</p>
<p>Just always creating something new.</p>
<p>It feels like it&rsquo;s tending towards something, like.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not dying.</p>
<p>If you die tomorrow, you still have all these hours of pods.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s kind of, you think you&rsquo;re cheating death</p>
<p>in a subconscious way, I think.</p>
<p>Right, you know who Ernest Becker is and?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard the name.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a book called Denial of Death,</p>
<p>this idea that if you don&rsquo;t acknowledge.</p>
<p>Books on my shelf.</p>
<p>Girls love it.</p>
<p>Like Dostoevsky.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m just, I&rsquo;m saying.</p>
<p>You want to bring Tolstoy, Dostoevsky?</p>
<p>Russian literature, it&rsquo;s back to norm.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s good to bring to,</p>
<p>because no American has read any Russian literature,</p>
<p>but they all appreciate it if you bring it.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not like they&rsquo;re going to ask you</p>
<p>any legitimate questions because they haven&rsquo;t read it.</p>
<p>So you can always pretend like you&rsquo;ve read it, so.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little dense.</p>
<p>Can we get a shortened version?</p>
<p>Cliff notes.</p>
<p>Yes, or make a movie with, you know, Ben Stiller</p>
<p>that I can just go, oh, this is based on,</p>
<p>what is it, life and death?</p>
<p>No, what&rsquo;s the one?</p>
<p>War and peace.</p>
<p>War and peace, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, so Ernest Becker&rsquo;s theory,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s this whole terror management theory</p>
<p>that basically says that like our terror of death,</p>
<p>our fear of death is one of the central creative forces</p>
<p>of the human condition.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the reason we&rsquo;re trying to, yeah, cheat death.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re trying to dilute ourself</p>
<p>that somehow we can become immortal through our art.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why you&rsquo;ve uploaded your special to YouTube</p>
<p>because you think your special</p>
<p>will outlive all of human civilization.</p>
<p>You think YouTube will outlive all of human civilization.</p>
<p>That could go away tomorrow.</p>
<p>That can go away tomorrow.</p>
<p>All of this can go away.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m truly grateful.</p>
<p>Mr. Mark Norman, that you would spend</p>
<p>your very valuable time with me today</p>
<p>even though it could all go away.</p>
<p>This could be the last day of our lives,</p>
<p>and won&rsquo;t you be quite upset that this is how you spent it?</p>
<p>Ah, yeah, in your hotel room, what am I?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like Harvey Weinstein here.</p>
<p>You poured me up, and now I feel fucked.</p>
<p>Just wait, what we have ready for you</p>
<p>after the podcast is over.</p>
<p>All right, brother, thanks so much for talking today.</p>
<p>Thank you, it was great.</p>
<p>Comedy.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation with Mark Norman.</p>
<p>To support this podcast,</p>
<p>please check out our sponsors in the description.</p>
<p>And now let me leave you with some words</p>
<p>from Mark Norman himself on his Twitter,</p>
<p>which you should definitely follow because it&rsquo;s hilarious.</p>
<p>The worst thing about getting Omicron for Christmas</p>
<p>is you know it was regifted.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.</p>
