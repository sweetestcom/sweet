    <p>My name is David Sachs, and I have a broomstick in my b****.</p>
<p>That is why my voice is so deep. I have never had friends in my life.</p>
<p>Somebody be my friend who I don&rsquo;t pay.</p>
<p>What a mood we&rsquo;re in today, huh?</p>
<p>What a vibe.</p>
<p>And instead, we open source it to the fans, and they&rsquo;ve just gone crazy with it.</p>
<p>Love you guys.</p>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p>Queen of Quinoa.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going all in.</p>
<p>Hey, everybody. Hey, everybody. Welcome to another episode of the All In Podcast.</p>
<p>With us today, the rotating cast of characters that you&rsquo;ve come to know and love and follow</p>
<p>on the Twitter, the Queen of Quinoa, David Friedberg is here, and the Rain Man, David</p>
<p>Sachs calling in from one remote location that is undisclosed, and the dictator, Chamath</p>
<p>Palihapitiya, with us again.</p>
<p>Gentlemen, how&rsquo;s everybody doing?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m punchy.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re punchy?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m punchy.</p>
<p>Chamath is in a mood.</p>
<p>Is he in a mood?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s happening, Chamath?</p>
<p>Nothing. I just finished a workout, so I think I&rsquo;m high on endorphins.</p>
<p>How much money did you lose in the market today?</p>
<p>Wow. Sachs comes in, and just a flagrant foul on the first play of the game.</p>
<p>No, he said he wasn&rsquo;t happy, so I was just hypothesizing, you know, what may be the cause.</p>
<p>I am happy. No, no, I am happy. I&rsquo;m about to go on Easter vacation, so I&rsquo;m happy about</p>
<p>that. Actually, can I just tell you-</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve accepted Jesus?</p>
<p>No, I mean, can I just tell you, March 2nd, or whatever that day was, was an absolutely</p>
<p>ludicrous day. We&rsquo;ve kind of clotted all back. We&rsquo;re doing pretty decently for the</p>
<p>year again, but I got to say, my gosh, I&rsquo;ve really learned to deal with drawdowns in the</p>
<p>last 30 days. It&rsquo;s been an amazing learning process. I&rsquo;m a better person for it.</p>
<p>You did look pretty shell-shocked that episode.</p>
<p>Dude, honestly, I mean, I lost more money than I ever thought I would make. I could</p>
<p>bail out a small country, you know, and it just vanished. It just evaporated in a day.</p>
<p>It was incredible. Then it came back, and then-</p>
<p>Came back.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>Well, what do we think is happening in the markets right now in terms of retail investor</p>
<p>participation and the number of SPACs that are coming into the market? I saw a statistic today</p>
<p>that in Q1, there were 245 SPACs raised in Q1, or 250. That&rsquo;s on top of the 250 that were raised</p>
<p>last year.</p>
<p>More capital was raised in Q1 than 2020, 2019, and 2018 combined in SPACs.</p>
<p>Just to-</p>
<p>And just in Q1.</p>
<p>Just to put some further color on this, you had all these folks raise money. You had some</p>
<p>really questionable sponsors, to be completely honest with you. I&rsquo;m not going to call any of</p>
<p>these guys out because I don&rsquo;t want to give them any airtime, but like, you know, you literally</p>
<p>had people who ran companies into the ground, people who were kicked out of their companies for,</p>
<p>you know, sexual impropriety. It didn&rsquo;t matter. Any random dog and cat was able to raise a SPAC</p>
<p>in Q1. Now, on the back end, you&rsquo;re going to start seeing some real difficulty.</p>
<p>So, deals are getting retraded constantly, which means that, you know, IPOs that should have been</p>
<p>done at price X is getting discounted by 20 and 30% to get the deal done. There are all kinds</p>
<p>of side deals getting cut left and right. And this is just the beginning. And the reason is because</p>
<p>that- Friedberg, how much did you say? 265?</p>
<p>100 billion. There was about 110 billion raised in Q1, it looks like.</p>
<p>But how many deals? 260 deals?</p>
<p>298 were raised in Q1.</p>
<p>So, those 300- 248 in 2020.</p>
<p>So, we&rsquo;re still in the first inning, right? If you think about it, these SPACs have two years</p>
<p>to put the money to work. So, we&rsquo;re only max 90 days in to a two-year shot clock, a 700-day</p>
<p>shot clock. And so, you&rsquo;re going to see some really crazy behavior, I predict, in November</p>
<p>of 2022, right? Like, the last six months leading into the expiration of all these SPACs,</p>
<p>in between now and then, I think the market is really going to hold people accountable. So,</p>
<p>when we see a pipe opportunity now, we&rsquo;re incredibly firm on like, hey, listen,</p>
<p>the 2025 projections, we&rsquo;re going to back off of those. We want to see 2023 numbers,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to price it to that. We&rsquo;re going to price it with a margin of safety. And so,</p>
<p>these people come back and recut the deals constantly. There&rsquo;s a situation where this</p>
<p>one deal retraded three times before a price cut. Done. And it ended up being 35%, 40% below</p>
<p>where they started. Wow.</p>
<p>I sent Chamath a note I got this morning from my friend who works at one of the banks and</p>
<p>one of the bulge brackets. And they said there was like 50 pipes in the market last week.</p>
<p>And they think only five of them are going to get done. 50. And like, you know, Chamath, what,</p>
<p>like a quarter or two ago, like 100% were getting done or 80% were getting done, right? I mean&hellip;</p>
<p>Yeah. And quite honestly, they were meaningfully oversubscribed.</p>
<p>And now we&rsquo;re demanding the people that look at these pipes, I&rsquo;m one of them. But</p>
<p>so, I&rsquo;ve talked to some other people who do it. And we&rsquo;re all in the same situation,</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re demanding much better terms. And so, it&rsquo;s going to, it&rsquo;s going to, the pressure</p>
<p>is going to come on, not the founders and the companies. But it&rsquo;s going to come on the sponsors,</p>
<p>because I think sponsors will really have to put up a lot of their money to get these deals done.</p>
<p>And this is where you&rsquo;re going to separate the wheat from the chaff, because most of these</p>
<p>sponsors are doing it for a quick buck. And you&rsquo;ll see, without debating who you think it is,</p>
<p>when you see people unable to post the money to get a deal done, and that deal go away,</p>
<p>that is the charlatan.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Chamath, it seems like there&rsquo;s also a de-leveraging happening with the funds</p>
<p>that bought a lot of these SPACs and de-SPAC listings in the aftermarket,</p>
<p>right, which kind of creates a bit of a logjam on the back end for a lot of these.</p>
<p>So, you know, it&rsquo;s for those that are interested in some of these market dynamics,</p>
<p>one thing that I have learned in the last little while is that,</p>
<p>depending on who you are, risk is managed really differently. So, for example, like there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>friend gave me this language, and I&rsquo;m going to repeat it, because I think the way he said it was</p>
<p>very elegant. There&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s called inception to date risk. And then there&rsquo;s year to date risk.</p>
<p>So, what is the difference? If you&rsquo;re a hedge fund, you&rsquo;re really in the year to date business,</p>
<p>meaning, how am I doing in this current moment in time, because your compensation is driven from</p>
<p>that. And so, you&rsquo;re very much forced to manage short term volatility in your portfolio. And</p>
<p>a lot of it is very parametric when, you know, something goes down by x percent,</p>
<p>then you have to sell. And then if something goes down by y percent, you sell more. And if something</p>
<p>goes by down by, you know, z percent, you have to shut the position out. And those are extremely</p>
<p>codified. And so, when you have a lot of hedge funds who are parametrically running year to</p>
<p>date risk, and you have, you know, all of a sudden, you know, the threat of inflation,</p>
<p>bond yields go up, factor rotation out of tech, it&rsquo;s a running to the exits, then you have other</p>
<p>people who manage what&rsquo;s called inception to date risk. I would say Buffett is in that category,</p>
<p>you know, for us, for the most part, we are inception to date risk, because we don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>external LPs. And so, you can manage these different risk buckets differently. But you</p>
<p>have to appreciate that a lot of this volatility is a lot of year to date risk. Now, then you layer</p>
<p>on top of it these exogenous events, like what happened this week with our Chagos. And it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>absolutely incredible, because it just further amplifies all these people who would otherwise</p>
<p>have made very rational decisions may forced to make irrational year to date risk management</p>
<p>decisions. And that&rsquo;s what causes these massive swings and all this malaise in the market.</p>
<p>Saks, what are we seeing on in private company valuations? I know that, while we&rsquo;re seeing the</p>
<p>retreat in Chamath&rsquo;s part of the world, and people buckling down and maybe some more guardrails,</p>
<p>if we will, or maybe a tighter screening process for these companies going public. You didn&rsquo;t say</p>
<p>Fisker, Chamath, but that was the one that had me like, what, Fisker, didn&rsquo;t they fail twice already?</p>
<p>What are you seeing on the private market, Saks?</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s a very frothy time, to be honest, I think valuation levels are, I mean, they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>probably the highest I&rsquo;ve seen. I&rsquo;m seeing seed deals now, hot seed deals, not every seed deal,</p>
<p>get done in the high 20s. Same.</p>
<p>This is pre-revenue.</p>
<p>Yeah, pre-revenue. It used to be that like, you know, I remember when your pre-revenue</p>
<p>seed deals were more like a five to 10 cap, and then like that a little bit of revenue,</p>
<p>maybe a 15 cap, and like the hottest company out of YC.</p>
<p>Just explain what that means, Saks.</p>
<p>The hottest company out of YC.</p>
<p>No, no, a cap, a cap.</p>
<p>Cap is just a valuation. It&rsquo;s a $15 million valuation effectively. It&rsquo;s just done on a</p>
<p>convertible note called a safe, so it&rsquo;s, but for all practical purposes, it&rsquo;s a valuation.</p>
<p>So it used to be, you know, pre-revenue seed deals used to be in the five to $10 million valuation</p>
<p>range. Then, you know, a little bit of revenue would be 15, the hottest YC deal might be an</p>
<p>18 to $20 million valuation. Now we&rsquo;re seeing hot pre-revenue seed deals going for like</p>
<p>27 to 30.</p>
<p>And what percent, what amount of capital is going into that round?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s usually like a 10 to 20% dilution event.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s 3 million to 6 million.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re not calling this the Series A. They&rsquo;re still calling this the seed round.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the first money in the company, so it&rsquo;s still a seed. And I mean, we also do obviously</p>
<p>A and B and, and increasingly some growth investments. The price levels are basically</p>
<p>double where they were just, I would say like a year ago, you know, these same seed deals.</p>
<p>Same thing I&rsquo;m seeing. And it&rsquo;s making me think as a private market investor,</p>
<p>that maybe the right thing to do is to stop investing in some as many new companies and</p>
<p>work with the existing portfolio to raise capital. So I told my team, let&rsquo;s go through</p>
<p>the portfolio. Let&rsquo;s see who needs capital and let&rsquo;s help them shore up their balance</p>
<p>sheet when the market&rsquo;s hot and valuations are high, as opposed to going and trying to</p>
<p>get into every deal. So I think I&rsquo;m going to do maybe 30% less deals and redeploy my time</p>
<p>at getting the current portfolio cashed up and it&rsquo;s working.</p>
<p>What do you think of this strategy, Chamath or Sachs or Friedberg?</p>
<p>I personally like it. I think that venture investors are typically trained, I was trained</p>
<p>this way early on, which is to invest through the cycle, right? Just to think about this as</p>
<p>a constant patter of capital. And to be honest with you, I have issues with doing that, Jason.</p>
<p>And so I more agree with what you&rsquo;re saying, which is that I think like active risk management,</p>
<p>especially, I guess, if it&rsquo;s your own capital, but I just think active risk management is</p>
<p>important. It&rsquo;s important to acknowledge that the incremental SaaS company may not</p>
<p>be that great as it is. And so at 30 pre, maybe really stretching the bounds of reality.</p>
<p>Whereas to your point, what Sequoia has proven more than anything else to me is the value of</p>
<p>doubling down and backing up your winners. And so to the extent that money isn&rsquo;t infinite,</p>
<p>which it isn&rsquo;t for all of us, that&rsquo;s when I do think it&rsquo;s worthwhile saying, well,</p>
<p>I have a certain amount of money in my fund. If I think calm can 10x from here,</p>
<p>then I&rsquo;d rather put in a big check there. And you know, that&rsquo;s better than putting</p>
<p>a bunch of C checks into companies will still have a 90% failure rate at very,</p>
<p>very high prices where I don&rsquo;t own that much. So I do think active risk management</p>
<p>makes sense in moments like this. I mean, I guess my philosophy is a</p>
<p>little different, Jkal. I mean, so I, my philosophy as a VC is that the market sets</p>
<p>the price of the deals that I&rsquo;m ultimately a price taker. And my only decision really</p>
<p>is which deals I want to be in. Like I don&rsquo;t really get to set the prices. It&rsquo;s too easy</p>
<p>for entrepreneurs to run a process and get competing bids. So all I can really do is</p>
<p>decide which deals I want to be in. And I think the more that you try to chase value as a VC,</p>
<p>I think the more you end up investing in companies that aren&rsquo;t really that great.</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;re trying to, you&rsquo;re trying to find things that are mispriced as opposed to just</p>
<p>investing in the best companies. So now look, does do price levels affect my returns? I think</p>
<p>yes, I&rsquo;m sure the vintages do matter to some degree. But the most important thing is just</p>
<p>to be in the right in the right companies. Can I just can I just I&rsquo;ll give you the</p>
<p>counterfactual to what you just said. You know, if I if I look at my three big private funds,</p>
<p>fund one was healthcare, education, fintech, and some deep tech fund to was a massive over</p>
<p>indexation into SAS. And then fun three was a return to our knitting and a bunch of</p>
<p>deep tech stuff. And a lot of fun threes decisions was basically me saying enough of the SAS.</p>
<p>And the reason was because I didn&rsquo;t like the valuations, David, and I thought on the margin,</p>
<p>if I&rsquo;m going to invest $10 million, I&rsquo;d rather get a 3d printing spaceship company off the ground,</p>
<p>then the end plus for a SAS business. And it&rsquo;s turned out to have been in that cohort,</p>
<p>the right decision. So I don&rsquo;t know, I think it&rsquo;s, I think that can also be true,</p>
<p>which is like chasing the hottest thing was not in 2016 was not a good idea.</p>
<p>So so just let me respond to it real quick, Jason, because so. So I do like SAS investing,</p>
<p>but I was doing it before it got hot, you know, it&rsquo;s just that&rsquo;s kind of my area. And I want to</p>
<p>build a franchise in that area, because that&rsquo;s where my expertise are. And so I can&rsquo;t like very</p>
<p>well, just say, hey, the store is closed this year, because price levels are high. Otherwise,</p>
<p>like founders won&rsquo;t come to invest through this. Yeah, exactly. So I&rsquo;m trying to create like a very</p>
<p>specific franchise in being the leading VC and bottom up SAS. And look, sometimes the price</p>
<p>levels be favorable during COVID. There was like a four month period where the markets were off,</p>
<p>what 50% everyone, like, it felt like we had the market to ourselves, the VC market, I mean,</p>
<p>nobody else was investing, we did more deals during that four month period than I think any</p>
<p>other four month period. So like, sometimes the price levels can bounce in your favor. But, you</p>
<p>know, my view on it is I just want to invest the best companies and kind of the price levels was</p>
<p>work themselves out. The counter I would have to your counter, David was, if there are other</p>
<p>startups who are of equal value, which pool you decide to go fishing in matters. So, you know,</p>
<p>this $30 million deal, if I was to put $3 million into it, that could equal me putting with our</p>
<p>accelerator, which not everybody runs an accelerator, it&rsquo;s arduous, it&rsquo;s painful, it</p>
<p>takes a ton of work. But that equals for me 30 deals at 100k each. So I&rsquo;m looking at it going,</p>
<p>do I get one bet in this YC overpriced company with 50? You know, tier three venture capitalists</p>
<p>and dentists backing up the truck, and now family offices who don&rsquo;t know anything are now competing</p>
<p>against the people they are LPS and their funds? Or do I just say, you know what, if everybody&rsquo;s</p>
<p>fighting in the market for the apples, I&rsquo;m going to plant more apple trees, and I&rsquo;m going to run</p>
<p>a better orchard. And that&rsquo;s what I decided to do is maybe I&rsquo;ll just move up to the orchard a</p>
<p>little bit. But I guess there&rsquo;s multiple ways to win in what we do. But you guys</p>
<p>are broader in your strategy than I am, right? Like you guys actually do invest in lots of</p>
<p>different kinds of companies. I&rsquo;ve kind of gravitated away from that, because I&rsquo;d rather</p>
<p>just focus on my speciality, which I feel like is big enough for me to be successful, right?</p>
<p>Yeah. But what if there&rsquo;s a new category that comes out like on demand and something like Uber</p>
<p>comes along or Airbnb, and it doesn&rsquo;t fit the framework?</p>
<p>Well, I invest in those companies. But so marketplace,</p>
<p>would you do it now? Or would you say, you know what, don&rsquo;t bring this to David,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s gonna say no, because your team is doing the first round interviews, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, but but we do marketplaces and my partner,</p>
<p>those didn&rsquo;t look like marketplaces originally, though. Those are not considered like eBay or</p>
<p>crisis. I invest in them because I thought they were marketplaces. So, you know, so look, we do</p>
<p>marketplaces and we do SAS, that&rsquo;s a huge part of the market, we&rsquo;re never going to suffer for</p>
<p>for deal flow focusing on those things. But look, will I do chips? No. Will I do pharma? No, because</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know anything about those. Yeah, no, those are two or quantum computing or something</p>
<p>like that, you know, these more esoteric, hard tech subjects that I kind of make fun of Freeberg for,</p>
<p>or at least, you know, when he starts giving his qubit lecture.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, actually, you know, what is it? No, it&rsquo;s a big one. I actually think we need to really</p>
<p>rethink our investment strategy here. I forgot to tell you guys, I&rsquo;m going to start investing in</p>
<p>laundromats. I want to Yeah, it&rsquo;s not a bad idea. I mean, our one of our mutual friend, one of our</p>
<p>besties, who&rsquo;s who&rsquo;s a stealth bestie was really into the dominoes, chains. And boy, was he right</p>
<p>about that? That stock went crazy. I want to get into this. Is it art? She goes, or she goes?</p>
<p>Machiago, geez, I want to get this archaic goes thing. But I also want to point out two things</p>
<p>from just housekeeping. Number one, I redirected wet your beak to a type form for people to pitch</p>
<p>the besties. Guess how many pitches came in in the first week? How many? Over 1000. I now have</p>
<p>three researchers going through it and categorizing it, they&rsquo;re going to share a Google Sheet back</p>
<p>with y&rsquo;all have by stage where they are to start going through them. But it&rsquo;s pretty amazing. I</p>
<p>think there&rsquo;s some I think there&rsquo;s some magic that&rsquo;s going to happen here. We&rsquo;re going to find</p>
<p>a deal where all four besties can be in deal because we got two besties in pipe. We&rsquo;re both</p>
<p>in cabana sacks and I and a couple of other companies, but we got to get a four. We need to</p>
<p>get four of a kind. We&rsquo;ve never had four of a kind. We&rsquo;ve had we&rsquo;ve hit sets. We&rsquo;ve hit a pair,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;ve never hit that. Go ahead, sacks. What do you want to do? You want to talk about me?</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly. I just wanted to put out a I need to put out a little PSA. So if you&rsquo;re a founder</p>
<p>out there listening, and you have a SAS deal, that&rsquo;s post revenue, send it to me a craft</p>
<p>ventures. And if it&rsquo;s everything else, you can send it to Jason on his little</p>
<p>is there were a lot of SAS companies, actually. And so what we should do is I can set the type</p>
<p>form up if you want. If you give me an email address, anybody who picks SAS, I can have an</p>
<p>email you or you know, Kevin or whoever on your team, you want to and I could just redirect it</p>
<p>in real time. But that could wind up being hundreds of emails. But I think that&rsquo;s what you want.</p>
<p>All right. Well, no, actually, well, you know, Jason, you should divvy up,</p>
<p>Jason, you should divvy up all these pitches by subject matter and send it to the bestie,</p>
<p>who is most relevant for all right, sounds good. We&rsquo;ll do that. Sure. And then second on the</p>
<p>housekeeping front, people were really interested in this longevity discussion.</p>
<p>Oh, read the thing. Read the thing. I think I want to because I want to talk about it again.</p>
<p>So Ben sent this into the all in Twitter handle, which is I think the all in pod. And it&rsquo;s got</p>
<ol start="70">
<li>Do you guys know we have 70,000 followers on that Twitter handle? It&rsquo;s crazy. Hey, just wanted</li>
</ol>
<p>to reach out with a positive message after listening to the podcast from two Fridays ago.</p>
<p>If you could pass the message along to the besties. I think that&rsquo;s us. After Tramont&rsquo;s</p>
<p>recommendation regarding longevity, I suggested to my dad age 56 in perfect health. So he&rsquo;s 10</p>
<p>years younger than sacks looks to go get a calcium dye test. It turns out he scored well above any</p>
<p>safe number. And a critical heart failure was inevitable. Now he&rsquo;s taking proactive steps with</p>
<p>a cardiologist. It&rsquo;s hard to even fathom what would have happened if Chamath had impassionately</p>
<p>recommended this action. Thank you guys so much for providing value weekend. We just I want to</p>
<p>Chamath saving lives, saving lives and billions. No, don&rsquo;t don&rsquo;t joke around. It&rsquo;s stupid. On this</p>
<p>topic, I really want to say this again, if anybody hasn&rsquo;t done it after the age of 40,</p>
<p>you can get a CT angiogram. Most health services provide it. I would really ask your primary care</p>
<p>physician if they say no, tell them to go fuck themselves and find somebody who will give it to</p>
<p>you. But this is one of these things where if your calcium score is greater than zero,</p>
<p>it doubles every year and there&rsquo;s a certain score right above several 1000 where you are guaranteed</p>
<p>to have some meaningful cardiac issue. And so whether it&rsquo;s for you or your parents, just ask</p>
<p>the question, have you had a contrast CT and you&rsquo;re done and if not go and find a doctor who</p>
<p>will prescribe it to them and get it done. It&rsquo;s just a no brainer. I am a no brainer. It&rsquo;s a no</p>
<p>brainer. And I had my yearly physical and I got the heart. No, I just did my physical but I I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>going to do that full body scan you recommended pre pre Nouveau pre Nouveau I&rsquo;m doing and then</p>
<p>I got on the net plus booster the true nigen that yeah, I think that freeberg suggested and I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>taking it seriously and I started with my personal trainer two Tuesdays ago and I changed my entire</p>
<p>diet and I&rsquo;m just really taking it seriously now because I hit 50. So let me let me tell you about</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s a guy, this is incredible. So this guy ran Asia pack for Julian Robertson. Julian</p>
<p>Robertson is a legend of finance and capital markets and was the founder of tiger, tiger</p>
<p>management. By the way, I heard this incredible story. Why did Julian name it tiger management?</p>
<p>Apparently, he had an he was incredibly bad with names. And so he would just call everybody</p>
<p>tiger, like, hey, tiger, how you doing, tiger, tiger, tiger, tiger. And so when he started this</p>
<p>fun, I think his son apparently told him, Dad, you&rsquo;re not going to remember anybody&rsquo;s name,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not even gonna remember the name of the company, just call it tiger management,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll remember it. Anyways, Julian is famous for having attracted an incredible roster of</p>
<p>people to work for him. It&rsquo;s what the PayPal mafia would look like if it were disguised as</p>
<p>a hedge fund. All these amazing people work for Julian went off and did these other incredible</p>
<p>things. And one of these guy, one of these guys was this guy, Bill Huang, who ran Asia pack for</p>
<p>tiger, he leaves, he starts his own fund. And somewhere in 2011, he gets pinched by the feds</p>
<p>for insider trading some Chinese bank stocks. He pays a $60 million criminal and civil penalty,</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s forced to give back all of his outside money. And so now he&rsquo;s a family office.</p>
<p>Then he takes however much money he had, and he runs it up to somewhere between five and $10</p>
<p>billion. So this is a guy who managed to just hit the ball out of the park.</p>
<p>And then what he does is he goes to these banks, and he says, you know what, guys, I&rsquo;m going to</p>
<p>make a bunch of concentrated bets in a bunch of Chinese internet companies and media companies</p>
<p>like Viacom and discovery. So what he does is he does an equity swap. And what an equity swap is</p>
<p>to get through all the noise is just a very simple way for you to bet on the appreciation of a stock</p>
<p>relative to an index and hedge it against an index. And what it synthetically allows you to</p>
<p>do is take big risk on huge positions and not be listed in disclosures. So you don&rsquo;t want buying</p>
<p>the stock. Yeah. So if you don&rsquo;t want to know, so the word synthetic, just because I&rsquo;m confused,</p>
<p>synthetic means you&rsquo;re not actually buying the stock, you&rsquo;re doing this in the ether.</p>
<p>If you went and bought 4.9% of Viacom, nothing would happen. The minute you got to 5%, you&rsquo;d</p>
<p>have a regulatory filing obligation that would say Jason Calcanis owns 5% of Viacom. Then at 9.9%,</p>
<p>nothing else would happen. But then at 10%, there&rsquo;s another incremental thing. So</p>
<p>this was a way of him accumulating up to 9.9 or 10% of these positions without having to disclose</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s not actually buying the stock. He&rsquo;s having Morgan Stanley Goldman Sachs,</p>
<p>Nomura, Deutsche Bank, Credit Suisse buy the stock for him using these over the counter</p>
<p>derivatives. But they&rsquo;re not in some cases didn&rsquo;t even buy the stock. It was like a forward purchase</p>
<p>agreement almost, right? Like these were contracts for difference. So they didn&rsquo;t even have to buy</p>
<p>the stock in a lot of cases, right? Right. And then I think it was hedged by the S&amp;P,</p>
<p>right? So they basically hedged it out with the S&amp;P and it was like factor weighted.</p>
<p>Anyways, long story short, what happens is that the guy starts to get stopped out on a trade.</p>
<p>And then they have to close out all these positions. And so all of a sudden,</p>
<p>they realize, oh, my gosh, we actually each of us gave this guy five or 10 times leverage. So</p>
<p>instead of a $5 or $10 billion hedge fund, it was $50 billion of notional exposure.</p>
<p>And so in one day, you had Viacom go down 30%. Discovery went down 30% or 40%.</p>
<p>And we were playing cards looking at the market saying, what&rsquo;s going on?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s going on?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So weird.</p>
<p>But another example of like asymmetric information and a lack of transparency in financial</p>
<p>Yeah, there were two drivers of this. Number one is the guy traded via the swap,</p>
<p>these over the counter transactions. So he didn&rsquo;t actually have to go buy the stock on the market.</p>
<p>And number two is they, the guy relied on a number of exemptions as a family office,</p>
<p>right? So he didn&rsquo;t have a lot of reporting requirements that say, you know, a lot of</p>
<p>other funds might have to disclose. And so there was a kind of opacity to the transactions that</p>
<p>were going on. So ultimately, when everyone kind of looked under the hood, it was like, Oh,</p>
<p>this is a lot like that long term capital management fiasco that happened in 1997.</p>
<p>I think we talked about it on one of the shows, but they had a book with like 60,000 derivative</p>
<p>contracts with over a trillion dollars of notional exposure on a $5 billion book of business.</p>
<p>So if, you know, if the overall portfolio that they held moved by whatever it is, you know,</p>
<p>half a percent, the whole thing collapses. And that&rsquo;s effectively what happened when</p>
<p>stocks got volatile in 1997. During that currency crisis, and then all the banks looked under the</p>
<p>hood. And they&rsquo;re like, Oh, wait, I need more collateral. There was no collateral to post</p>
<p>because everything was levered up. And then everyone&rsquo;s struggling to get a piece of the pie,</p>
<p>you know, of the cash that&rsquo;s left, everyone was fighting to get a piece of it.</p>
<p>Because if everyone had to sell off, the whole portfolio would collapse and everything</p>
<p>starts to spiral out of control. And that&rsquo;s sort of what happened on Friday, right?</p>
<p>Because as they started to sell off these positions, via big block trades, the stock</p>
<p>went down and made it even harder. And then everyone piles on and start shorting the stock,</p>
<p>and it becomes this uncontrollable fiasco. I have a really dumb question for the</p>
<p>why are people giving this amount of leverage and letting people make these trades? Is it because</p>
<p>they have no responsibility, the brokerage houses, whoever&rsquo;s clearing, they&rsquo;re gonna lose,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna lose money. I mean, I think JP Morgan, Nomura, these guys are all gonna lose</p>
<p>billions of dollars, because there&rsquo;s not enough cash in this guy&rsquo;s actual account</p>
<p>to cover all the losses. Now, why would they let him do this is my really simple,</p>
<p>stupid question. Because they make money, they make money. I mean, if you&rsquo;re making five,</p>
<p>I mean, think about it this way. It&rsquo;s sort of like an insurance deal, right? Like,</p>
<p>if I can make 5 cents by taking $1 of exposure with you, but that exposure only pays out if</p>
<p>something terrible happens, that&rsquo;s very unlikely in my assessment. I&rsquo;ll take that 5 cents all day</p>
<p>long, you know, I&rsquo;m collecting nickels. But once once in a while, something really bad happens,</p>
<p>and then they got to pay out $1. How many more Manchiego&rsquo;s are out there?</p>
<p>Well, I think I think it depends on how you define the problem. But if you say that</p>
<p>leverage, everybody&rsquo;s levered, I think the question is, by how much? I think it&rsquo;s pretty</p>
<p>rare at this point, that you&rsquo;re not levered, we don&rsquo;t run leverage, but it&rsquo;s tantalizing. I got</p>
<p>to tell you, because like, you know, I could run, I don&rsquo;t know, 100 $150 billion of exposure,</p>
<p>and then all of a sudden, you know, you only have to return, you know, one or 2% to make a ton of</p>
<p>money. What would your margin interest rate be if you were to run your book levered?</p>
<p>I could run it 10 times and pay 1%, 2%.</p>
<p>Right. That&rsquo;s crazy, right? So, with 10 times leverage on your money, you basically just have</p>
<p>to beat one point or two point of return, and you make money. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s so attractive, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s so attractive. And that&rsquo;s what that&rsquo;s what that&rsquo;s what a lot of these other</p>
<p>organizations do the business model that they&rsquo;ve perfected, which I think is very reasonable,</p>
<p>by the way, says, again, back to sort of like, you know, managing year to date risk, right?</p>
<p>They manage extremely small movements in stocks, because instead of saying to, you know, if the</p>
<p>four of us were running a hedge fund, hey, each of you do your best, and we&rsquo;re going to run one</p>
<p>times notional, it&rsquo;s much better to say, I&rsquo;m going to severely constrain the parameters in</p>
<p>which you guys can take risk. And on the back end, I&rsquo;m going to lever the whole thing up 10 times,</p>
<p>my only goal is for you guys to make me 1% a year, right? Because if I lever it up 10 times,</p>
<p>now I&rsquo;ve made 10%. And that 1% a year now all of a sudden divided by 12 months of the year</p>
<p>means you&rsquo;re generally you know, you only have to do 80 basis. So all of a sudden, the math starts</p>
<p>to work in your favor, where everybody says, wow, let&rsquo;s raise as much money as possible.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s make sure there&rsquo;s extremely tight risk parameters. Let&rsquo;s just tell David Friedberg and</p>
<p>Jason Kalkanis and David Sachs, just give me 80 basis points. And on the back end, I lever up</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the whole business model of most hedge funds. And then, you know, you have some folks</p>
<p>at the edges, as Friedberg says, you know, the insurance policy rarely pays out. But then every</p>
<p>now and then you have this cataclysmic set of events and the long tail hits and you&rsquo;re wiped</p>
<p>out. And that&rsquo;s what happened here. And by the way, you know, there are stress tests against</p>
<p>the banks to and where they basically look at scenarios of you know, how bad can the overall</p>
<p>portfolio get that the banks are exposed to, you know, all these clients that they have as</p>
<p>counterparty risks, because remember, like when they sign a contract with this hedge fund, they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not actually taking a position, what they&rsquo;re doing is they&rsquo;re taking, they&rsquo;re creating an obligation</p>
<p>where this hedge fund has to pay them in the future. Now, if the hedge fund effectively goes</p>
<p>bankrupt, then they&rsquo;re not going to get paid on the mean on the back end, they&rsquo;re expecting to</p>
<p>get paid $2 billion, or whatever the amount might be to cover the you know, the trade that they put</p>
<p>in place with the guy. So this whole thing basically becomes a loss that they get exposed</p>
<p>to. And so the stress tests are meant to kind of expose how bad can the loss be to make sure that</p>
<p>the bank doesn&rsquo;t ultimately go bankrupt if a really bad scenario were to take place. Now,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of debate about whether those stress test methodologies actually work,</p>
<p>and whether they adequately reflect the true risk in the markets and the true risk that these banks</p>
<p>take on. And that has always been a debate. The problem is, if you make the stress tests too</p>
<p>limiting, the cost of capital goes up, and it&rsquo;s very hard to trade and liquidity goes down in the</p>
<p>market. That&rsquo;s the counter argument to why you wouldn&rsquo;t want to be kind of more regulatory on</p>
<p>this front. And so it&rsquo;s an ongoing kind of fluid debate about what&rsquo;s the right way to stress test</p>
<p>banks and make sure that they have adequate capital reserves, while still creating low cost</p>
<p>capital and having liquidity in the markets. But you add the risk of ruin.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s really hard to balance playing with your entire net worth on the poker table,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not just buying in with 1% of it or 10% of it.</p>
<p>Whenever you read a story about some rich person going broke, there&rsquo;s always debt involved,</p>
<p>right? Because let&rsquo;s say you got like, I don&rsquo;t know, like a big number, like $100 million,</p>
<p>right? And let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re fully invested, the market goes down 50%. You still got 50 million</p>
<p>bucks, you&rsquo;re still like a very rich person. Yeah. But now let&rsquo;s say that you took that 100 million,</p>
<p>and you levered it up to, I don&rsquo;t know, whatever, a billion, and then the market goes down 50%.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re worth zero. Yeah, right. Or in that case, the market could go down 10% sacks. And that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what happened here, right? Like only 10%. Right, exactly. The guy levered it up. And this is what</p>
<p>always this is what happened with LTCM. In LTCM case, the trades they had the whole portfolio</p>
<p>only moved like 5%. But it caused a cataclysmic collapse of hundreds of billions of dollars of</p>
<p>notional exposure. And that that&rsquo;s sort of like what happened with this guy. He was so levered up.</p>
<p>I searched for this guy on YouTube, just to kind of figure out who he was on Saturday.</p>
<p>Oh, the Christian YouTube thing. He said, I sent it to the group.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s like all these videos of him talking about Jesus. And it was just a,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m fine with him being deep into Jesus, especially, you know, on the way to Easter.</p>
<p>God bless you. Praise Jesus. But it was very weird. This person has a very unique philosophy,</p>
<p>clearly. And no, no more. The prime broker on Monday warned of significant launches</p>
<p>losses estimated at 2 billion from the unwinding of these trades.</p>
<p>Let me ask you, let me ask a question to you guys. If we all agree, it&rsquo;s a really bad idea</p>
<p>for individuals to get over levered like this. How bad an idea is it that the US government is</p>
<p>getting so over levered, we now have 130% of our GDP, we are now in debt. It&rsquo;s the first I mean,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re I think it only recently crossed 100%. So we have now borrowed as a country more than our</p>
<p>entire GDP. And I mean, if you look at that by country, there are other countries that are way</p>
<p>over that, like Japan, just about there aren&rsquo;t that many, there aren&rsquo;t that many. And Japan&rsquo;s</p>
<p>had a horrible decade, partly because of all that debt.</p>
<p>Italy, Portugal, Greece, and Japan. Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, not a club you want to be part of.</p>
<p>I think that I&rsquo;m more sympathetic to governments being over levered, because I think, because</p>
<p>governments effectively are at this point, still, that may not be the case in the future.</p>
<p>The the only form of too big to fail that I think we can tolerate, I have a much bigger issue</p>
<p>with private market participants being over levered, because I think that</p>
<p>is a level of greed and risk that shouldn&rsquo;t exist.</p>
<p>In large part, because the governments themselves are so levered on the way in. So maybe that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>way to think about it, which is, if we have to isolate risk, and we know we can&rsquo;t tell governments</p>
<p>to stop spending, then I think we should probably make sure that risk is better managed at the</p>
<p>individual level, you know, people and companies.</p>
<p>Why can&rsquo;t we tell governments to stop spending?</p>
<p>Yeah, I was about to say, I think we can tell them that, because we vote them in. But I mean,</p>
<p>this, I want to open up&hellip;</p>
<p>People vote in spenders, people don&rsquo;t vote in&hellip;</p>
<p>Well, this is the thing, you know, the Republicans were supposed to be the spendthrifts.</p>
<p>Yeah, no one ever gets elected saying, I&rsquo;m not going to do anything. Right? I mean,</p>
<p>Donald Trump may be the first president to have ever actually said that and, you know,</p>
<p>actually do something in that vein, when he put a bunch of guys in charge of like the CDC</p>
<p>and the Department of Energy, and they just cut heads. But, you know, you always go in and you</p>
<p>say, I&rsquo;m going to do x that isn&rsquo;t being done today. And as a result, over generations, it adds</p>
<p>up. And all of a sudden, you wake up and the United States is 250 years old, and we have debt</p>
<p>equal to 130% of our GDP, and we&rsquo;re struggling to maintain the growth rates needed to fund that debt.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re like, oh, that&rsquo;s the biggest challenge with democracy and keeping it alive is,</p>
<p>is the fact that ultimately, everyone wants more. And so over time, you vote for more.</p>
<p>And over time, it gets more expensive. And over time, it becomes really difficult to maintain.</p>
<p>Can I can I just count up the bill for just this year? So as we know,</p>
<p>yeah, so that the bill so far for this year, first of all, the government is running like</p>
<p>a four and a half trillion dollar deficit. A lot of that is, you know, COVID related. But</p>
<p>in any event, Biden&rsquo;s already passed a $1.9 trillion COVID bill, they&rsquo;re now about to pass</p>
<p>a at least $3 trillion infrastructure bill to the proposal came out. It&rsquo;s two. No,</p>
<p>yeah. Well, okay, sorry. It&rsquo;s two for the infrastructure plan. But then there&rsquo;s another</p>
<p>one to 2 billion that they&rsquo;re talking about doing sorry, trillion, that they&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re planning as</p>
<p>a second package called the American families plan that they&rsquo;re calling infrastructure, but it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s more like social programs. They&rsquo;re kind of relabeling that as social infrastructure,</p>
<p>human infrastructure. And they&rsquo;re trying to figure out whether they can do them as two</p>
<p>separate bills. There&rsquo;s this issue with reconciliation and they need they need a</p>
<p>ruling from the Senate parliamentarian on whether they can do the second bill through</p>
<p>through reconciliation. If they can&rsquo;t, they may have to combine it into one bill. Otherwise,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll do just two separate bills. But you&rsquo;re looking at total, like for about 4 trillion</p>
<p>across those two bills. You know, in addition to the 1.9, we&rsquo;ve already passed. So we&rsquo;re looking</p>
<p>at like 6 trillion of spending this year, I think we had about 6 trillion of COVID emergency</p>
<p>spending last year. And so the numbers are getting really big really fast reminds me of our last</p>
<p>trip. This reminds me of Las Vegas trip with Cipriani and then your markers. We may need to</p>
<p>have some austerity measures. We might need to go to Olive Garden instead of part of the issue</p>
<p>sacks is, you know, I think if you guys will remember on election night, I told you the thing</p>
<p>I was most concerned about was this Georgia runoff. And if the Senate takes if the democrats</p>
<p>take the Senate, you have no balance of negotiation in this process of, of passing these bills and</p>
<p>finding a point of fiscal responsibility versus social necessity, or what might be deemed necessity</p>
<p>by some but but, you know, exuberance by others. And, and it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s frightening, because,</p>
<p>you know, with a with a single party system, right, a single party, legislative branch, or</p>
<p>right now, we have a real issue with the, the fact that any bill can kind of be come up,</p>
<p>can kind of be defined by one party by a small group of people, they can get it passed,</p>
<p>they can get it signed. And, you know, it&rsquo;s going to be a challenge for for us to all</p>
<p>kind of support this level of debt for generations to come. And it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s not going to stop anytime</p>
<p>soon. I mean, you know, before the midterms, we&rsquo;ve got another year and a half of this</p>
<p>100%. And that&rsquo;s why I was rooting in the the last election for gridlock as well. And, and we</p>
<p>almost had it. I mean, it was supposed to be a divided Senate. Purdue won that Senate seat,</p>
<p>and then he lost decided to burn the entire Republican Party on the way out. Congratulations,</p>
<p>David, you&rsquo;ve destroyed the Republican Party. Look, you take out you have a little bit of a</p>
<p>point there. Because the reality is, as of election night, this was supposed to be a divided</p>
<p>Senate. And then what happened in the two months that followed turn voters against those Senate</p>
<p>candidates. So you have it, you definitely have a point there. But but the price tag for that</p>
<p>one Senate seat is going to be about $6 trillion. Yep, it&rsquo;s pretty disturbing that our, our debt to</p>
<p>GDP ratio is now worse than Spain and Portugal. I mean, Italy and Greece. Well, I think it&rsquo;s worth</p>
<p>just explaining to people why that matters, right, sex. I mean, like, when you when you</p>
<p>have to pay, you have to pay. Well, here&rsquo;s the thing. Here&rsquo;s the thing. Everyone&rsquo;s been lulled</p>
<p>into a false sense of security, because interest rates are so low. So the debt service has actually</p>
<p>been relatively small. But if interest rates ever go back up, say, because of inflation,</p>
<p>like the debt service will be one of the biggest chunks of federal spending, we won&rsquo;t have money</p>
<p>left for all the programs that we need. You know, including entitlements, including defense,</p>
<p>including everything else, you know, that the country wants to do. And so it&rsquo;s very dangerous.</p>
<p>And the real problem I have with it right now is, everybody can see the economy is getting better,</p>
<p>right? It&rsquo;s it looks like we&rsquo;re about to have the roaring 20s. The economy looks like it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>rebounding. It&rsquo;s about to boom. Goldman Sachs says we&rsquo;re gonna be down to like 3% unemployment by</p>
<p>the end of the year. It&rsquo;s coming back really fast. COVID is going to be over in May. I mean,</p>
<p>everything is trending the right way. And we&rsquo;re acting like, you know, like there&rsquo;s an emergency</p>
<p>happening still. I mean, I understand the 6 trillion last year, during the middle of COVID</p>
<p>to prevent a depression. But what is the rationale today when the economy is already coming back</p>
<p>for this election, David reelection to consolidate democratic power and to get reelected?</p>
<p>Right, pump the prime the pump. But you know, we&rsquo;re breaking the glass in case of emergency</p>
<p>when there is no emergency. And what happens if there is another emergency?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll go to 150%.</p>
<p>Look, I don&rsquo;t think this is as intentional as getting reelected. I do think that the</p>
<p>politicians and the people involved in the legislative process have very good intentions,</p>
<p>and think they&rsquo;re doing the right thing. And they got elected, and they spent their whole lives and</p>
<p>their whole careers dreaming of a day when they could create these programs using government</p>
<p>money dreaming of a day when they could make these opportunities real. And here&rsquo;s a moment</p>
<p>in time where they can and where these visions for what they believe to be a better society and</p>
<p>a better government and a better country for all its citizens. They have this moment now and they</p>
<p>are and so I&rsquo;m not criticizing anyone. I think it&rsquo;s just it&rsquo;s I think it&rsquo;s Yeah, no, you can</p>
<p>totally disagree with the point. And I think in many cases, I agree with you. But I do think that</p>
<p>there isn&rsquo;t like this, this kind of evil incentive or this evil reason for folks doing it. I think,</p>
<p>you know, a lot of people that work in government or politicians, they spend a lot of time thinking</p>
<p>about doing what&rsquo;s best for their, you know, their kind of people that they represent. And</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s this moment where I can create all these programs and create all these jobs and spend all</p>
<p>this government money to give my people locally, all these all the support that I always thought</p>
<p>that I always told them I would give them one day. And it&rsquo;s a moment where everyone&rsquo;s kind of</p>
<p>rushing. And because there&rsquo;s a single party system right now, everything&rsquo;s getting done. And</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all getting piled on top of pile. It&rsquo;s like leading eating cupcakes and then cake and then</p>
<p>pancakes and then, you know, ice cream and then having a milkshake. You know, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s gonna</p>
<p>have a really nasty stomachache at the end. Yeah, I agree. It&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s, we may have a sugar</p>
<p>rush over the next year or two. Maybe maybe Biden gets reelected based on this. But you know,</p>
<p>eventually, I like I like your term stomachache. Biden seems to me a little bit miscast. It&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s cast from a different era. And you know, this is not 1933. We don&rsquo;t need this massive</p>
<p>amount of pump priming by the federal government. We&rsquo;re not in a depression. We&rsquo;re not even in a</p>
<p>recession right now we&rsquo;re coming back really strongly. And so it just feels like we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>passing all this anachronistic pork barrel, right spending, you know, like for why it&rsquo;s like almost</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s just habitual, as opposed to having a real need. I think that&rsquo;s a more nuanced take,</p>
<p>which I agree with, which is like, if you actually see what that $2 trillion infrastructure</p>
<p>bill look like, there was a lot of stuff, which did feel incredibly anachronistic, where I was</p>
<p>like, I mean, paving a fucking road. I mean, we had China trolling us because the contents of</p>
<p>stupid, right? It&rsquo;s like, I mean, it&rsquo;s like paving a road is this one time event that does nothing.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re, we&rsquo;re much we&rsquo;re much better off building ongoing capability of things we need.</p>
<p>So if we&rsquo;re going to, like, green the economy, and, you know, education, go through an energy</p>
<p>transition, there&rsquo;s all kinds of ways to spend the money. And so then you think,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s advising these people? Well, and then and then I think it goes back to lobbyists,</p>
<p>lobbyists and donors. Yeah, let&rsquo;s go through this list, right. So of the $2 trillion,</p>
<p>it looks like about 620 billion is going into transportation infrastructure, like Chamath said,</p>
<p>bridges, roads, public transit, etc. Now, if you think about the benefit to society,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s the benefit of having better roads, which we can debate, does it, you know, do all</p>
<p>of these need this care, the $620 billion worth of care? I think some people would say yes,</p>
<p>some people say no. But the question of where that those dollars actually go, ultimately,</p>
<p>if you kind of look at how government contract work is done, there will be a few people that</p>
<p>own the majority of these contract service providers that will benefit heavily from this</p>
<p>capital coming out of the government&rsquo;s coffers and will go into their bank accounts. And yes,</p>
<p>there will be some jobs, but they will be temporary jobs. And there will be temporary</p>
<p>salary and wage support through this. A lot of that capital will go to the people that own the</p>
<p>businesses that are doing all of the construction work and supporting this industry development.</p>
<p>So you know, it&rsquo;s concerning when you look at how much money is going to get funneled</p>
<p>into effectively corporate contracting. I don&rsquo;t care. I don&rsquo;t care what side of the aisle you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>on. But if you see $620 billion of spending that&rsquo;s going to happen in the next few years for anything,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re thinking anything other than this will be wasted and inefficient,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re being really naive. So you know, the good, a good microcosm example of this is the one that</p>
<p>you use Friedberg, which is how much money did California give to Anderson Consulting or,</p>
<p>you know, to build that COVID website? It was</p>
<p>Yeah, it was like 100 million bucks, like all in with the service cost and the customer support</p>
<p>all the stuff that was attached to it. And realistically, you could have built it for 90</p>
<p>bucks using Wix. So my, so my thought is that exactly, like people should look at this,</p>
<p>irrespective of whether you&rsquo;re on the left or right thing, well, of that 620,</p>
<p>how much will actually get into the hands of people in a thoughtful way? Probably like 300,</p>
<p>how much of it will go into like lining the pockets of shareholders and folks in very specific</p>
<p>companies who just print an enormous amount of profit over the next few years, probably another</p>
<p>150 or 200 billion? Wait a second. So you did you send my red pills to Chamath&rsquo;s house?</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s have the counter argument, right? The counter argument is for decades, and I&rsquo;ll make</p>
<p>it right. So for decades, roads have been crumbling infrastructure in this country has</p>
<p>been falling apart. We haven&rsquo;t taken care of federal highways, there&rsquo;s all this work that</p>
<p>needs to be done to make sure that airports address rural communities and ports can take</p>
<p>ships into the economy can grow. And someone&rsquo;s got to build all that stuff at some point.</p>
<p>So, you know, rather than deal with this down the road, let&rsquo;s take advantage of the single party,</p>
<p>you know, governing system we have right now and pass this bill and get it all done. And get</p>
<p>America ready for the future. That would be the argument, right? I&rsquo;ll give you the most cynical</p>
<p>argument. The most cynical argument is, let&rsquo;s ratchet up spending, make everybody concerned</p>
<p>about the debt, so that the solution is raised taxes. And let&rsquo;s create a wealth tax. And let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>create this tax. And then Biden is raising taxes, tax rate to 28%. Individual individual, yeah.</p>
<p>Like, I think raising the corporate tax is a no brainer. We should absolutely have done that. But</p>
<p>David, I mean, Friedberg, back to what you said before, what I would have said is like, look,</p>
<p>the the counter the counter argument would have been, let&rsquo;s take the $620 billion and plan the</p>
<p>future. So the plan the future would be, you know, why is it that like Elon can can bore a truck,</p>
<p>you know, a traffic bearing tunnel at $1 million a mile, and the next best equivalent is 20 million</p>
<p>a mile. Okay, maybe we should give these guys a bunch of contracts. Yeah, well, just end technology,</p>
<p>I would say, and and less graft and less waste. So let these guys build a bunch of tunnels. And</p>
<p>maybe they can figure out a way to build bridges to or, you know, if you really want to care about</p>
<p>like future jobs in the national security of America, let&rsquo;s secure our own precious metals</p>
<p>and minerals. And let&rsquo;s have an entire supply chain that&rsquo;s, you know, independent of China.</p>
<p>Well, you could spend a couple $100 billion on that easily. So there&rsquo;s all kinds of ways to</p>
<p>spend it, we could build high speed rail, you know, they do have 580 billion. So almost a quarter a</p>
<p>little over a quarter of this bill, going to American manufacturing, R&amp;D and job training,</p>
<p>right. So creating the next generation of jobs for Americans. And we like that, you know,</p>
<p>redomesticating industry here. I mean, honestly, those words sound nice. What are the exact</p>
<p>you like the words? You really love the words? Yeah, I mean, I like I mean, one that I think</p>
<p>nobody can argue with is universal pre kindergarten, that&rsquo;s easy. And I think</p>
<p>community college tuition, being free is a great one as well, if people have a certain score to</p>
<p>get in there. So it&rsquo;s a little bit of merit, Jason, what are these things even, what are</p>
<p>these things even doing an infrastructure bill? I feel like I think Freeburg has a point that like</p>
<p>infrastructure is like one of the last things that people believe that the government should</p>
<p>be spending money on. So now they&rsquo;re just branding anything that they want to do as</p>
<p>infrastructure there, you know, it&rsquo;s human infrastructure, be bridges, roads, right,</p>
<p>not to say education and childcare and college, that&rsquo;s education should be a different bill.</p>
<p>But didn&rsquo;t I mean, Obama tried to get infrastructure passed, he couldn&rsquo;t Trump.</p>
<p>He did. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,</p>
<p>Obama passed close to a trillion. I think it was like a $920 billion bill. Remember the shovel</p>
<p>ready projects? It was supposed to be a trillion dollars of shovel ready projects. They did it.</p>
<p>Where&rsquo;d that money go?</p>
<p>Well, speaking of money, speaking about money disappearing,</p>
<p>can you make a little shrug emoji con like the</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s the brown version. And here&rsquo;s the white, here&rsquo;s the pale white version.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s the brown version. And it looks like you&rsquo;re the tan version freebirds. You got a little</p>
<p>son. Yeah. A trillion dollars. Me no, no. I don&rsquo;t know. We can all go to Vegas and we can</p>
<p>lose money and just come up to our wives and go like this. Yeah. I just think like the government&rsquo;s</p>
<p>so bad at like properly dispensing all this money. Like that&rsquo;s the problem that you know,</p>
<p>and then that would look, I think if you&rsquo;re ever going to do infrastructure, the time to do it was</p>
<p>in 2009. When Obama did it, like the economy was an absolute, like a great recession. That made</p>
<p>sense. But now when the economy is doing is rebounding so strongly, do you really believe</p>
<p>that these, you know, $100 billion line items are gonna be wisely spent, you know, and most of it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>borrowed money. So no, and the problem is, like, by the time it gets into the details, well beyond</p>
<p>what Biden is capable or has the time to learn about, it will be just completely misallocated.</p>
<p>And, you know, some lobbyists will insert something that gets something that&rsquo;s important</p>
<p>to some politician, the money and that and that and that&rsquo;s the that&rsquo;s the sad truth of it all.</p>
<p>And we just have to hope that there&rsquo;s enough good that comes out of it.</p>
<p>And now taxes are coming for you.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s the next thing is the wealth tax</p>
<p>is where that conversation is. What happened in that? What happened in the bill? Well, ACA,</p>
<p>I saw I saw the corporate tax went up from 21 to 28. But what else happened?</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s a wealth tax in California being discussed again,</p>
<p>who knows? Okay, but at the federal level, was there anything? No, I didn&rsquo;t know about</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s possible.</p>
<p>The first the first bill is going to be funded by like you said, an increase in the corporate tax</p>
<p>from 21 to 28%. The second bill, the Families Act is going to be funded in part by personal</p>
<p>income tax increases, which I think will be more controversial. They&rsquo;re going to bump up</p>
<p>well, the campaign statement that Biden made was individuals no one making under 400,000</p>
<p>would see a tax increase. So the plan was 400,000, going up to 39.6%. But here&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s where I think it could get very controversial is that the White House is</p>
<p>already making noises that it wasn&rsquo;t 400,000 per individual, it was $400,000 per family,</p>
<p>which would mean $200,000 per individual, which would be I pretty much a camp, a broken campaign</p>
<p>promise. So if that&rsquo;s where it ends up being, I think Biden could take a lot of heat for that.</p>
<p>And but but the problem is, if he sticks to 400,000 per individual, I&rsquo;m not sure that it</p>
<p>will raise enough, the tax increase will raise enough money to pay for everything he wants to</p>
<p>pay for. So it&rsquo;ll be I would be I would be totally okay with this when I was 30 years old. I&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>putting that on the record. I&rsquo;m not okay right now. This may sound dumb, but what is the federal</p>
<p>tax rate? Like what is it going for the top the top rates like 37 and a half. So it&rsquo;s a 2%. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not a big it&rsquo;s not a gigantic increase at all. It&rsquo;s a bit of big nothing broker. Okay.</p>
<p>Yeah. And this is income tax again, not capital gains.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll be Yeah, and then there&rsquo;s a bunch of questions about whether like,</p>
<p>so capital gains is still a big question mark. And capital gains will all go to income.</p>
<p>Yeah. There&rsquo;s a big push. But they haven&rsquo;t said yet. So this is gonna be part of the second bill,</p>
<p>which they&rsquo;re talking about doing, I think in October. So, you know, watch out.</p>
<p>Okay, wait a second. If they go if they if the capital gains happens, then the whole idea of</p>
<p>being a capital allocator, it&rsquo;s gonna change everything, wouldn&rsquo;t it? I think it&rsquo;s a bigger</p>
<p>issue than that. It has less to do with that. But you have $30 trillion sitting in 401ks and IRAs.</p>
<p>And the idea that you&rsquo;ll tax all of those gains in a differentiated way, I think is going to be a</p>
<p>very complicated proposition. Well, those aren&rsquo;t taxed. Well, they&rsquo;re taxed on the way out, right?</p>
<p>You still pay something. Not if you hold them till you&rsquo;re 55. But I mean, whatever, you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to live to 110. So, so yeah, actually, it was actually had a story just today that the</p>
<p>infrastructure bill like does not include capital gains taxes. But the big question is what they&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>do in the next bill. You know, and that&rsquo;s and then so you combine that, let&rsquo;s just say,</p>
<p>the federal government decides capital gains, we don&rsquo;t want to invest in companies anymore.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t want to treat stock gains the same because we want to have more equity, equality,</p>
<p>whatever. Then you combine that with this wealth tax proposal in California,</p>
<p>ACA is a resolution to propose an amendment to the Constitution state co authors have proposed</p>
<p>a wealth tax described as a 1% surcharge for amounts over 50 million and 1.5% for amounts</p>
<p>over 1 billion. So if you&rsquo;re a billionaire, just you&rsquo;re gonna have to pay, you know, 50.</p>
<p>Can I make a case to you guys, I&rsquo;ve kind of been thinking about this, but I&rsquo;d love your</p>
<p>feedback on it. So I feel like there&rsquo;s a trade off between freedom and equality.</p>
<p>And what I mean by that is, if you if you give a market freedom, a market of people doing things</p>
<p>freedom, you maximize progress that that society achieves. And the United States is the best case</p>
<p>study of this in history. In 250 years, we went from a bunch of people living on plantations or</p>
<p>living on small farms to a, you know, the largest economy in the world.</p>
<p>And so the more freedom you provide, the more innovation there is, the more entrepreneurship</p>
<p>there is, the more of inventing new stuff there is the problem with progress. Progress takes</p>
<p>everyone forward. But progress is always asymmetric, meaning some people end up in a</p>
<p>greater point further ahead than everyone than a lot of other people do. Whereas like a socialist</p>
<p>state with less freedom, incentives, and incentives, you take everyone forward together,</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t make as much progress. And so if you want to have freedom, you have the most</p>
<p>amount of progress, but you have the least amount of equality over time, even though everyone is</p>
<p>further ahead than where they started 200 years ago, or 100 years ago, or even 10 years ago,</p>
<p>everyone&rsquo;s in a better position than say they were some period of time ago, because we&rsquo;ve all</p>
<p>got better social security programs and whatnot. There are some people that get so much farther</p>
<p>ahead, like Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos, and these people that you can now look to and say, this is</p>
<p>unfair, this person&rsquo;s taken so much capital, and I&rsquo;ve only made, you know, a 10% increase in the</p>
<p>last 10 years. And so as a result, they&rsquo;re in a democracy, there&rsquo;s always this tension between</p>
<p>freedom and equality. And those are the two things that cycle in terms of what voters vote for,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re coming into a cycle now, where we&rsquo;re going to start to vote down freedom and vote up equality.</p>
<p>And this is sort of what the wealth tax in my mind represents is this, this kind of</p>
<p>redistribution, or this returning to a kind of the mean or reversion to the mean in terms of like,</p>
<p>get everyone back on the same page. But as a result, we&rsquo;re going to see much less progress</p>
<p>economically, we&rsquo;re going to see much less progress in terms of innovation, and other</p>
<p>places that have more freedom, and enable more innovation and infrastructure and entrepreneurship</p>
<p>are going to be able to kind of leap ahead and have greater progress than us.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my kind of rant and thesis, but I&rsquo;d love you guys&rsquo;s</p>
<p>I would amend your thesis slightly to say that freedom produces prosperity,</p>
<p>right. And prosperity does produce some inequality, because there are always people</p>
<p>like Elon or Jeff Bezos, or whatever, who are just going to be like super producers,</p>
<p>especially in the era of technology, where you can create a machine to produce goods and services.</p>
<p>And that machine can be 1000s or millions of times as productive as the ordinary person. So</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going to build extraordinary wealth. But look, the basic idea of liberal society is you</p>
<p>have a free enterprise system, where people are generally free to create their companies and their</p>
<p>businesses. And then you have a social safety net that&rsquo;s paid for by the largesse of that system.</p>
<p>And the thing about socialism is, it can only make it we talked about this last time,</p>
<p>it can only make everyone equally poor, it never makes everyone equally rich,</p>
<p>you end up killing the golden goose for everybody. And you also end up with a lot</p>
<p>less freedom, because you end up with a gigantic state that exists to level everything. And they</p>
<p>accrue all this power for themselves. But is that actually true? Like,</p>
<p>if you look at China, is that really what&rsquo;s happened in China, China&rsquo;s kicking everybody&rsquo;s</p>
<p>ass. And they&rsquo;re basically a socialist. Yeah, this author, they&rsquo;re authoritarian.</p>
<p>Exactly. They&rsquo;re, they&rsquo;re, they&rsquo;re sort of,</p>
<p>politically using using Friedberg&rsquo;s language, they don&rsquo;t have as much freedom or that freedom</p>
<p>is granted by, you know, authority, a central authority. Yeah. Which makes them authoritarian,</p>
<p>by definition, which means somebody like jack ma can do amazing until he does it.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s a perfect example. He&rsquo;s still doing fine. He&rsquo;s got 50 billion, maybe he doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>But imagine what he could do if he could keep going. And this is the point I wanted to make,</p>
<p>which is what if you got Elizabeth Warren, or Bernie Sanders proposals enacted and Bernie</p>
<p>Sanders gone on TV many times and said there should be no billionaires. If Jeff Bezos stopped</p>
<p>building Amazon, when he made a billion dollars, because he was forced to by the government,</p>
<p>at that point, all the future benefit of Amazon would have been lost. It&rsquo;s not like someone else</p>
<p>would have been able to step in on top of that platform and build more. And then the next guy</p>
<p>steps in and makes the next billion. And I just want to remind everyone, the benefits of Amazon</p>
<p>are extraordinary. I mean, imagine going back 20 years and being or being a kid. And I can go in</p>
<p>my friggin phone. And I can say I want something and it shows up at my door the next day for</p>
<p>very little for same day for very little money. I mean, it is fucking mind blowing what Amazon</p>
<p>has built for us for society. It&rsquo;s an incredible business at the same time. And we are all willing</p>
<p>to give that business money because the benefit of what they do for us is so extraordinary.</p>
<p>And if you had kept Jeff Bezos as wealth, or capped his ability to kind of keep elongating</p>
<p>what that business could do at some point, it would have been an absolute travesty. And I</p>
<p>would argue that even though Jack Ma is doing fine, there are people in China who are limited</p>
<p>in terms of what they can do, because of the way that that government limits freedom and limits</p>
<p>flexibility. And so to me, I&rsquo;m observing this tension between freedom and equality, where</p>
<p>equality is becoming such a sticking point for people now that it is far more important than</p>
<p>freedom. And as a result, we are going to start to see these little things creeping in like a</p>
<p>wealth tax or a limit on billionaires or all this sort of stuff that ultimately limits the ability</p>
<p>for people to kind of push their businesses and elongate progress. And if you looked at the great</p>
<p>scientific and technical discoveries of the last 30 years, so many of them came from the United</p>
<p>States because of this, this freedom, not from China, and China&rsquo;s certainly done fine.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re a great copy machine. And they&rsquo;re great at saying, Hey, here&rsquo;s some slave has been</p>
<p>here. The innovation has been in the United States. Yeah, China observed what was working</p>
<p>in the US and they realized that they should adopt markets because markets create prosperity,</p>
<p>they create goods that create services, they create, you know, wealth for their people. So</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve embraced markets. And then meanwhile, we&rsquo;re moving away from markets, or we have</p>
<p>such skepticism of markets, you&rsquo;ve got this sort of extreme socialist sort of Bernie wing</p>
<p>of the of the party that is kind of moving away from markets. It&rsquo;s bizarre.</p>
<p>You know, just look at the free market in the Amazon example, they demanded a $15 minimum wage,</p>
<p>they got the $15 minimum wage. And now they&rsquo;re still attacking Amazon and Jeff Bezos.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s never going to be enough for them. They want to see him get rid of all of his money.</p>
<p>No, no, no, that&rsquo;s right. I think I think that you&rsquo;re saying something else, Jason,</p>
<p>which is really important. I think people you have to think about the generation of</p>
<p>kids that have been raised by boomers. And and that&rsquo;ll explain the psychology of why they think</p>
<p>that way. You know, we had all kinds of failure modes growing up, you know, we meaning, you know,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in my mid 40s. If you think of our generation and older, right, we all had failure modes,</p>
<p>you wouldn&rsquo;t get into the schools you wanted, you, you know, basically had a lot more freedom where,</p>
<p>you know, after school, you were latchkey kid, you know, you would have just all kinds of like</p>
<p>very nominal ways of growing up. You didn&rsquo;t necessarily get to play on the school team,</p>
<p>if you didn&rsquo;t make it, you know, and those boundary conditions create these great stories</p>
<p>like the Michael Jordans of the world. And then you fast forward to how boomers felt. And I think</p>
<p>that boomers felt an enormous amount of guilt about their stresses on the system. And what</p>
<p>did they do to millennials and Gen Z, you got, they got everything they wanted, it was kindergarten</p>
<p>soccer, everybody gets a gold star. And now you have an entire generation of people that quite</p>
<p>honestly, are like wondering, like they actually have been raised in a quasi socialist setting.</p>
<p>You know, if you go to if you go to school, there is no free speech. If you do a project,</p>
<p>and you know, your grades aren&rsquo;t good, you can get a redo, everything&rsquo;s a redo,</p>
<p>everything&rsquo;s a retrain, everything&rsquo;s we&rsquo;re going to manage to the middle, you can&rsquo;t lose.</p>
<p>And you can&rsquo;t lose. And in that not losing. I think people have forgot what it feels like</p>
<p>to actually win. And that humans are actually in many ways. Like Darwin&rsquo;s perfect example of</p>
<p>winning, you know, like why us and not other strain of chimpanzee, because we need we wanted</p>
<p>to win more than anybody else, as it turned out. And that&rsquo;s lost, we&rsquo;ve lost that script. And so</p>
<p>I think part of it is you have an entire generation of people who, whatever you do,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not enough. It&rsquo;s because they were raised in a society where they never had to actually learn</p>
<p>what functional winning and losing felt like, or, or it&rsquo;s been deeply minimized,</p>
<p>said another way that we&rsquo;ve gotten soft, and we&rsquo;re about to get our asses kicked by China,</p>
<p>if we don&rsquo;t start to realize that a vibrant competition of ideas, and products and services</p>
<p>is what wins, I think we have a more dangerous thing than that, Jason, it&rsquo;s not that that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gone. I think it&rsquo;s actually more this selective idea. So for example, like, if you were a fashion</p>
<p>designer, creating clothes on Shopify, or Fashion Nova, you&rsquo;re allowed to compete and win.</p>
<p>But if you build a technology that aggregates resources, and that has these crazy gross margins</p>
<p>of profit margins, you&rsquo;re not allowed to win. So we&rsquo;ve actually gotten into this very contorted</p>
<p>period where we want to choose how to define what winning feels like to us. And I think that&rsquo;s where</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s dangerous, because that&rsquo;s a very subjective thing. And it ebbs and flows.</p>
<p>Can we go back to the wealth tax for a second? Because I think this is like,</p>
<p>monumentally, yeah, hold on, let me just finish the statistics on it. They claim there are 169</p>
<p>billionaires in California. So this wouldn&rsquo;t impact a lot of people. And they estimate the</p>
<p>wealth tax would generate over 22 billion. We&rsquo;ve already seen Elon and it won&rsquo;t. That&rsquo;s a static</p>
<p>analysis. That&rsquo;s a stupid analysis, because it&rsquo;s completely Keith left. You&rsquo;re all gonna leave,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re all gonna leave. Look, I&rsquo;ve talked to a lot of people. I&rsquo;ve talked to a lot of people</p>
<p>about the wealth tax who would be subject to it. Okay. Every single one tells me the same thing,</p>
<p>which is if California passes this, this is a red light for me, I&rsquo;ll leave the state,</p>
<p>every single one. So I&rsquo;ve heard the exact same thing. Yes, you&rsquo;re not gonna raise 22 billion</p>
<p>from this, you&rsquo;re gonna raise, it&rsquo;s actually gonna lead to a decrease in tax revenue, because</p>
<p>so many of these people are going to leave the state, and they&rsquo;re going to take investment with</p>
<p>them, their businesses with them, their job creation with them. It&rsquo;s going to actually</p>
<p>more than half the tax revenue in the in the state of California, right from the</p>
<p>what is it the top 1% is that the statistic, it will kill the California economy. Now,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s the crazy thing about it, probably the most crazy part of that whole wealth tax proposal.</p>
<p>And by the way, even if you support a wealth tax at the federal level, it&rsquo;s stupid for California</p>
<p>to do it on its own. Because it&rsquo;s very easy for you to leave California, you just move some other</p>
<p>part of the United States, much, much harder to leave the United States. So the idea that like</p>
<p>California can just do this on its own is like the height of stupidity by these by these</p>
<p>legislators. So the stupidest part of the whole bill is that there&rsquo;s a 10 year look forward,</p>
<p>which basically says that if you spend any time in California, we&rsquo;re going to try and tax your</p>
<p>wealth for the next 10 years. So that means that for all of us thinking about this concept,</p>
<p>if we think this wealth tax might pass in the next 10 years, we might need to leave the state now we</p>
<p>might need to get ahead of the curve. And I&rsquo;m hearing people now debating whether they should</p>
<p>leave the state, because they think it&rsquo;s inevitable that something like this passes.</p>
<p>And the sooner they sever their nexus with California, the less likely they are to be</p>
<p>roped into it. So just the mere fact they&rsquo;re proposing this bill, I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to get the votes in this legislator. There&rsquo;s six Democrats already come out against it. So</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s going to pass this year or next year. But the fact that they&rsquo;re even</p>
<p>putting it on the table is making a lot of people second guess whether California is the place they</p>
<p>want to create their businesses. And what we really need is for the governor Gavin Newsom to come out</p>
<p>right now and say, listen, like, this is a bad idea. I will veto it. I will not, you know,</p>
<p>support this. If I&rsquo;m governor for the next, you know, five, six years, and his mere failure to</p>
<p>come out and say what he really thinks about this is hurting the state. Because a lot of people</p>
<p>already contemplating Do I need to leave now?</p>
<p>sex? Let me ask a philosophical question. Do you think that this kind of speaks to a broad</p>
<p>challenge with democracy, as I kind of tried to point out earlier, which is, at some point,</p>
<p>the majority can take things away from the minority by just passing a law by voting.</p>
<p>And when you make that vote, the majority of people aren&rsquo;t affected. Therefore, they&rsquo;ll say,</p>
<p>Sure, let me I mean, I know that, you know, you have more background in this than the rest of us.</p>
<p>But like, what is the political science principle here on how democracy kind of protects itself</p>
<p>from having the majority eat the minority, when the minority, you know, in this particular case,</p>
<p>funds the state&rsquo;s budget, right? And like, well, there&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s a famous and the voter doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>see that. Yeah, there&rsquo;s a there&rsquo;s a famous line in political philosophy that democracy is not</p>
<p>two wolves and a sheep voting on what they&rsquo;re going to have for dinner. Okay, that there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>concept. There&rsquo;s a concept, in addition to democracy of rights, you know, that that you</p>
<p>have rights that the government can&rsquo;t just take away. And so part of the American founding wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>just sort of the majoritarian machinery of government. It was a preoccupation with with</p>
<p>the rights of individuals and minorities to be protected against what majorities would do. That&rsquo;s</p>
<p>why we have the Bill of Rights. So yeah, I mean, there have to be rights of individuals that are</p>
<p>protectable on some level. And I and I think it&rsquo;s a real constitutional issue, whether the wealth</p>
<p>tax is even allowed. Well, that&rsquo;s, I think, that&rsquo;s, I think, where it&rsquo;s going to get fought and lost,</p>
<p>because the the clever order in the Supreme Court will say, if this what comes next? Is it are we</p>
<p>going to go back and saying, you know, all of a sudden, the majority doesn&rsquo;t like certain kinds</p>
<p>of other kinds of minorities? There&rsquo;s a lot and you can&rsquo;t have a certain kind of car or house,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t have a certain car. Oh, wait, I actually don&rsquo;t like the tone of the color of your skin.</p>
<p>Oh, wait, religious minorities, all of a sudden, we&rsquo;re back to the 1940s. And I just don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>this is going to pass because it&rsquo;s not justifiable. At the federal level, I do think that you can just</p>
<p>basically jack up taxation and do a bunch of other things that that make it more fair. I&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>be honest with you guys. I&rsquo;m a little torn on this topic. And I&rsquo;ll tell you why. On the one hand,</p>
<p>if I had to pay one and a half percent a year, I&rsquo;m like, okay, what is the marginal utility of</p>
<p>that money for me? It&rsquo;s basically zero. So it&rsquo;s not as if I would feel that change of 1.5%.</p>
<p>The thing that would upset me more is not having to pay the 1.5%. But then to see it wasted,</p>
<p>that would drive me crazy. Because then I would think, you know, I could have bought</p>
<p>potable water for, you know, a native Indian tribe in California. I mean, actually, here&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a perfect example. I just found this out today, you guys would be shocked. There is an incredible</p>
<p>shortage of clean water in the Central Valley. There are places today where you&rsquo;re and my fellow</p>
<p>compatriots of California live, where they have to buy these huge $12 arrowhead jugs of water,</p>
<p>because the water is completely poisoned. And when I heard that yesterday, I thought in California,</p>
<p>in the United States of America, and then he said to me, you can give for two and a half million</p>
<p>bucks, you can basically get 5000 people clean water through this thing that he&rsquo;s working on.</p>
<p>So for me, the thing that would be upsetting is not paying the 1.5%. It would see it would be</p>
<p>seeing nothing gets solved from it. And then and then what it would really prove is what I said</p>
<p>earlier, which is it&rsquo;s just a bunch of belly aching from folks that actually just don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>how to actually seek success. And that&rsquo;s the thing is that you can run for the governor of the state</p>
<p>of California and fix that website. Yeah, that is the benefit of democracy is you know, you can</p>
<p>kind of run and you can step in and you can help solve these problems at the government level,</p>
<p>but we could start a podcast and try to use our influence or we could donate to things guys,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll say something else. I also think that these kinds of bills are actually a shot across the</p>
<p>bow to a handful of people that are not playing by the rules anymore. We&rsquo;re not towing the line</p>
<p>and standing in line and saying I&rsquo;m clearly demarcating myself as a democrat. I&rsquo;m clearly</p>
<p>demarcating myself as a republican. I&rsquo;ll play nice. Because think of what&rsquo;s really happened</p>
<p>in COVID. You&rsquo;ve had a massive explosion in DTC distribution, right? Think of the platform that</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve created out of nothing. Think of the platform that Elon Musk&rsquo;s has out of nothing.</p>
<p>And if you if you take that writ large, it&rsquo;s extremely disruptive to people who</p>
<p>is all about controlling the message which allows them to control power. And I think that a lot of</p>
<p>these rules are these ways of almost like counter punching against it, but they&rsquo;re ineffective. I</p>
<p>what I would encourage all of us to do is actually become completely Zen. And instead continue to</p>
<p>aggregate distribution power, because that will replace the one and a half percent tax that you</p>
<p>have to pay. Because if you can talk to people directly, and tell them your version of the truth</p>
<p>and allow them to underwrite their version of the truth against what you said, that is</p>
<p>modern power. And that&rsquo;s worth a lot more than the money that you&rsquo;ll pay.</p>
<p>Now, would you give that same power to Donald Trump? Because he&rsquo;s been cut out.</p>
<p>I think you have to in that model.</p>
<p>All right, everybody. We&rsquo;ll be taking next week off. Because it&rsquo;s spring break. And you can take</p>
<p>the week off as well. Anybody have any plugs or things they want to promote? Why are we taking the</p>
<p>week off? Because I don&rsquo;t want to take the week off. I&rsquo;m fine with doing it. I think some people</p>
<p>are going to be on vacation in there. Someone&rsquo;s going to be somewhere really nice. I&rsquo;m on it.</p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t you call in? Chamath? I don&rsquo;t know if the place Chamath is going to be has</p>
<p>internet access. We&rsquo;ll send you a Starlink. We&rsquo;ll get Elon to send you a Starlink.</p>
<p>All of my undisclosed locations have internet access.</p>
<p>For those of you who don&rsquo;t know, Chamath has rented the pyramids in Giza, and he will be</p>
<p>staying inside of them. And he&rsquo;ll be dismantling them, and NFTing them, and turning them to dust.</p>
<p>Obviously, I will be getting wrapped as a mummy in King Tut&rsquo;s tomb. He has robotic</p>
<p>waders serving him the whole time he&rsquo;s there. He&rsquo;s living out a sci-fi fantasy next week.</p>
<p>Well, you know what? I did tweet that we&rsquo;re going to do a live show after everybody gets</p>
<p>vaccinated. We&rsquo;ve been doing over 3 million a day here in California starting tomorrow, April 1st.</p>
<p>Live poker.</p>
<p>Live poker can occur. But we are going to be hosting, I think, Chamath and I.</p>
<p>New York City.</p>
<p>I think New York City. Saks is partial to Miami, because it&rsquo;s El Fuego, is that right?</p>
<p>Am I?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know. Are you?</p>
<p>But Jason, can we just agree, then? Let&rsquo;s do this, guys. Let&rsquo;s do May. We&rsquo;ll do it</p>
<p>somewhere in New York City. And then June, we can do Miami. How about that?</p>
<p>Well, June, it&rsquo;s going to be too hot. I would flip that, because it&rsquo;s going to be too hot.</p>
<p>But also, I&rsquo;ll tell you the other reason.</p>
<p>Two-city tour.</p>
<p>Well, we could do both. But I also think that we should do Miami first, because</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not afraid to come out to an audience. I think that people in New York and California</p>
<p>still have, they have more PTSD.</p>
<p>Yeah, we need to go where people are the most reckless. I agree. Let&rsquo;s go where people have</p>
<p>absolutely, totally gone YOLO. I mean, just to close on this, Friedberg, as the, you know,</p>
<p>man of science here on the pod. At this point, these vaccines have been proven to not only keep</p>
<p>you from dying, keeping you out of the ICU, we now found out this past week, correct, that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not going to carry it and infect other people in all likelihood.</p>
<p>Very true. And another,</p>
<p>Sorry, sorry, sorry. What happened?</p>
<p>Yeah. And another interesting point was made this week by a paper that was published showing that</p>
<p>you have effectively 80% efficacy from your first shot, about two to three weeks after your first</p>
<p>shot. And then you go to 90% after your second shot. And then there&rsquo;s another paper that showed</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re actually better off waiting over three months for your second shot, not getting it three</p>
<p>weeks later.</p>
<p>So you were right, you said we should do one shot and then come back to the second.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right. And so there&rsquo;s now there&rsquo;s now very good data that shows that that would have been a</p>
<p>better move, because we would have had double the throughput in terms of how many people we could</p>
<p>have gotten shot in arms, if we had done that. So everyone effectively gets 80 90% protected,</p>
<p>or 80% protected after the first shot. And then it&rsquo;s better to wait three months. And so we could</p>
<p>have done the back half of the year where everyone gets their kind of booster, a second shot,</p>
<p>and the front half of the year, give the whole United States a first shot.</p>
<p>But David, David, what&rsquo;s the where&rsquo;s the article that says you don&rsquo;t carry it,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;ve gotten the vaccine? I need to know that because that&rsquo;s like the</p>
<p>thing that&rsquo;s always in the back of my mind.</p>
<p>Yeah. No, I tweeted it. I tweeted it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t follow you.</p>
<p>Experts say it appears I&rsquo;m reading.</p>
<p>I ratio to my ratio.</p>
<p>I see you I see you&rsquo;re retweeting some of my ideas.</p>
<p>You know, because I love you. Okay, because I&rsquo;m your friend, and I fucking love you.</p>
<p>Usually you usually say back some you&rsquo;ll say back at some point. I don&rsquo;t know what I have to do for</p>
<p>you. Yeah. I mean, I mark I mark up your deals. I you know, I take care of your family. I mean,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m here for you.</p>
<p>Mark up that pipe deal. That pipe deal has gone supernova with that chamath</p>
<p>pixie dust on top of it. Experts say it appears COVID-19 vaccines can help reduce the transmission</p>
<p>of the new coronavirus from person to person to say this is accomplished by reducing the</p>
<p>viral load in a vaccinated person&rsquo;s nose. Besides the statistics on this, you know,</p>
<p>there is no documented proof that someone was fully vaccinated and transmitted COVID to someone else</p>
<p>out of 400 million total vaccinations globally. So there&rsquo;s a you know, also like a really strong</p>
<p>point to make, which is show me the evidence that it can, because you know, everything about biology</p>
<p>and you know, science would indicate in terms of how this would work. There&rsquo;s no reason the</p>
<p>virus should be spreading and that you suddenly become infectious and contagious. Of course,</p>
<p>this is like the most obvious study ever that look, if you get the vaccine, it prevents you</p>
<p>from getting sick. You&rsquo;re also not going to transmit it to other people. But let me ask a</p>
<p>question. Why is it that every time a politician says that the experts required it, it&rsquo;s always</p>
<p>the stupidest position? You know, because the experts on this show, we had Freeberg saying</p>
<p>this stuff, we had Bob Wachter from UCSF, who, you know, runs UCSF, saying that, you know,</p>
<p>we should have just done the first dose first, get everyone through on one dose, and then come</p>
<p>back and do the second dose. Of course, like no one in the federal government, a position of</p>
<p>authority took that position, Fauci didn&rsquo;t take that position. And then we have Fauci on top of</p>
<p>it saying that we might have to wear masks until 2022. But you know, because because because of</p>
<p>this, like asymptomatic, because you could be vaccinated and still spread it, which has now</p>
<p>been totally disproven. So why is it that whenever somebody says we have to listen to the experts,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re always listening to the stupidest because David, David, we are in a culture where independent</p>
<p>thought is not valued, where it is better to abdicate and look to an expert to tell you what</p>
<p>to do now. That is, again, I go back to we are in a cultural malaise of not wanting to make</p>
<p>our own. I&rsquo;ve been working on my Dr. Fauci sacks. Mr. Sacks, that&rsquo;s correct. asymptomatic patients,</p>
<p>by the way, may in fact infect other people, but we don&rsquo;t know yet. So it&rsquo;s best to wear a mask,</p>
<p>if not two masks, and to have proper distancing. The point you just made, I think is really</p>
<p>important, because I think it also reflects what I said earlier about economic inequality.</p>
<p>And an economic progress, when you have greater economic freedom, you have greater economic</p>
<p>progress, and then you will inevitably have economic inequality. The same is true with ideas.</p>
<p>So when you give people the opportunity to have the greatest freedom in terms of sharing and</p>
<p>expressing their ideas, you have the greatest progress, but you also end up with this opera,</p>
<p>this issue where people have vastly different ideas and inequality arises. And right now,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re in a mode of cancel culture. And we&rsquo;re in a mode of telling people that they can&rsquo;t say</p>
<p>certain things. And they have to be very careful about, you know, what they&rsquo;re saying in what</p>
<p>context, and it limits this ability for people to feel free to express themselves, share their ideas</p>
<p>and push the boundary and push the envelope and find the truth and find the best outcome. And so</p>
<p>I do think that we&rsquo;re in this kind of rationalization kind of stage of our democracy,</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;re reducing our kind of degrees of freedom. And it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s playing out in terms of</p>
<p>the ideas forum and the economic forum. And it just feels very resonant to me that both are very,</p>
<p>very linked right now. Can can I try to answer my own question, actually?</p>
<p>Yeah, which is never stopped before.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what I just realized, okay, listen, if you&rsquo;re going to make an argument that fundamentally</p>
<p>makes sense, you don&rsquo;t need to tell people, oh, go follow the science, you don&rsquo;t need to appeal</p>
<p>to some external authority, you can just lay out your argument. And it makes sense. When do you</p>
<p>need to say to everybody, listen, you need to shut down your own brain, you just shut down your own</p>
<p>logical thought process, and just follow what that person over there says, the people who need</p>
<p>to make that argument are the people who are making arguments that don&rsquo;t make any sense.</p>
<p>I mean, this idea of wearing a mask after you&rsquo;ve already been vaccinated never made any sense.</p>
<p>This idea of locking down the whole economy, instead of isolating the at risk people for a</p>
<p>whole year, it doesn&rsquo;t make sense. It&rsquo;s been done, David, it&rsquo;s been done by the left. And it&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>done by the right in equal measure. Whenever you have an opportunity to grab power, people will</p>
<p>abstract. And then they will aggregate and pull it in. And they will make decisions for people</p>
<p>by pointing to these abstract ideas. It has happened in forever. This is not a new thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that now with social media, you can distribute this power grab more efficiently</p>
<p>than before. And then you can see it for what it is, because you can debunk it. And that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the thing that&rsquo;s happened. That&rsquo;s why there&rsquo;s more anger around it. Because you can debunk</p>
<p>all this nonsense, you can actually say, well, what&rsquo;s the data say? And, but most people don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>want to do that. It&rsquo;s easier to abdicate responsibility.</p>
<p>All right, we want to thank Dr. Fauci, our great guest today, you want to</p>
<p>maintain social distancing, don&rsquo;t think for yourself, the CDC has been very clear.</p>
<p>The Chinese report from the who approved by Xi Jinping says it did not come from a weapons.</p>
<p>You know what you are, you&rsquo;re not even Fauci. You&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re that person. What&rsquo;s your what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>your name? The great actress, the comedian from SNL. She&rsquo;s got blonde hair.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah. Katie McKinnon or something. Yeah. Kate McKinnon doing Fauci.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what you are. You&rsquo;re like a babushka. You&rsquo;re like a babushka.</p>
<p>I just love that they have Ted Cruz being done by that other woman. It&rsquo;s like every time they</p>
<p>want to troll the Republicans, they take guys free bird. Oh, we&rsquo;re gonna go. He&rsquo;s meeting.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s meeting in a friend. Oh, what do you mean?</p>
<p>Oh, be careful. Oh, it got dirty. He got ugly. Take that last part out, Nick.</p>
<p>Be the last part out. Yeah, that he&rsquo;s having dinner with. And be all right. We&rsquo;ll see everybody.</p>
<p>Love you guys.</p>
<p>Oh, man. We should all just get a room and just have one big huge orgy,</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re all just like this, like sexual tension that they just need to release somehow.</p>
<p>What you&rsquo;re about to be. What you&rsquo;re about to be.</p>
<p>We need to get merch.</p>
<p>We need to get merch.</p>
