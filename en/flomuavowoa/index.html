lot</p><p>of questions on this topic</p><p>um type 1 diabetes is a situation where</p><p>you can&rsquo;t produce insulin anymore the</p><p>cells that make insulin of the pancreas</p><p>just are broken and this is the problem</p><p>because now you can&rsquo;t regulate blood</p><p>sugars so your blood sugar goes really</p><p>really high so a person that&rsquo;s type 1 is</p><p>dependent on</p><p>um insulin now what did they do before</p><p>they discovered insulin they did low</p><p>carb right because if you lower your</p><p>carb you decrease the need for insulin</p><p>and that&rsquo;s really the point about this</p><p>interview with Manuel who is a type 1</p><p>diabetic is that the goal is to take the</p><p>least amount of insulin possible to have</p><p>normal blood sugars because everyone&rsquo;s</p><p>worried about high blood sugar but what</p><p>about the high insulin you have to take</p><p>the damage is just as bad as the high</p><p>sugar so</p><p>welcome manual I appreciate you taking</p><p>the time out to tell us about your story</p><p>um</p><p>super excited to be here dog absolutely</p><p>a pleasure uh this is something that I</p><p>I&rsquo;ve obviously felt that responsibility</p><p>as I&rsquo;ve gotten better</p><p>in the subject I&rsquo;ve gotten more control</p><p>over my body like the fact that you are</p><p>here giving me the opportunity to share</p><p>this knowledge that I&rsquo;ve accumulated um</p><p>I&rsquo;m definitely honored by it</p><p>awesome how long have you been a type 1</p><p>diabetic Corp so it&rsquo;s going on 21 years</p><p>now I believe I&rsquo;m 41 I developed the</p><p>condition</p><p>um when I was 19 or 20 years old and uh</p><p>I I have a a theory that I believe that</p><p>I was probably and you can tell me what</p><p>your thoughts are doc I think I</p><p>mentioned this before I believe I was a</p><p>type 2 diabetic but then I didn&rsquo;t pay</p><p>attention to my body at all and I didn&rsquo;t</p><p>know what the heck was happening for a</p><p>few years potentially until I I was</p><p>actually living in Mexico and then I</p><p>lost so much weight and I was going for</p><p>the diabetic process of like having to</p><p>go to the bathroom every 30 minutes and</p><p>I couldn&rsquo;t sleep well and I was weak and</p><p>then my father was the one that told me</p><p>you&rsquo;re describing to me diabetes and</p><p>that was the first time that I even</p><p>understood what diabetes meant so I</p><p>think that I was a few years already in</p><p>the making until the pancreas collapsed</p><p>on me that&rsquo;s my theory and I could be</p><p>wrong so</p><p>this is an interesting point I just I</p><p>won&rsquo;t spend too much time but I want to</p><p>just mention typically type 1 is</p><p>autoimmune but but what about</p><p>what about a situation where a lot of</p><p>the type 2 diabetics</p><p>um after a while have to start taking</p><p>insulin because the cells of the</p><p>pancreas just start dying out now this</p><p>brings up an interesting point if you if</p><p>you never had the autoimmune situation</p><p>and this came from just going from type</p><p>2 to type 1</p><p>who knows who knows if that cell can&rsquo;t</p><p>come back I mean I would never rule it</p><p>out as uh impossibility so that&rsquo;s good</p><p>data okay so here&rsquo;s the thing the first</p><p>question is um</p><p>you before you did keto or intermittent</p><p>fasting you were taking how many units</p><p>of insulin per deck</p><p>so uh I think um I can I can say that I</p><p>have been pretty much skinny my whole</p><p>life</p><p>um all the way to obviously the age of</p><p>30 something I&rsquo;m 41 now metabolism</p><p>started going downhill I wasn&rsquo;t eating</p><p>that well that healthy and um</p><p>I believe that I was averaging before</p><p>Keto</p><p>somewhere around 40 units a day which by</p><p>the way I go to the doctor&rsquo;s office and</p><p>it&rsquo;s crazy how low the standards are and</p><p>you know that really well doc like the</p><p>medical community standards are</p><p>extremely low compared to your standards</p><p>that you have for People&rsquo;s Health I go</p><p>to the doctor and I tell them yeah I&rsquo;m</p><p>I&rsquo;m taking 40 units a day of my fast</p><p>acting insulin and I&rsquo;m taking uh 25</p><p>minutes a day of my long acting insulin</p><p>two types of insulin and they look at my</p><p>a1cs and they look at my body in general</p><p>and they say wow you&rsquo;re in really good</p><p>shape which tells me I always Justified</p><p>and I use that as like oh I&rsquo;m in really</p><p>good shape I don&rsquo;t really have to do</p><p>much of anything and my wife would</p><p>always say but but that doesn&rsquo;t make any</p><p>sense because there&rsquo;s so much more that</p><p>we can get with our bodies and how much</p><p>better we could get and I&rsquo;m like oh yeah</p><p>we&rsquo;ll see so I used to take a lot of</p><p>that insulin and I felt it was okay</p><p>because uh when compared to other</p><p>diabetics that were being treated on</p><p>these practices the doctors were blown</p><p>away with me some of these guys were</p><p>taking 200 units a day</p><p>like you know today yeah because the</p><p>average the average is uh 0.5 to 1 1</p><p>um times your kilograms in weight so I</p><p>don&rsquo;t know let&rsquo;s say you were 180 pounds</p><p>you&rsquo;d be taking about 40 to 80 units per</p><p>day on average but that was um but some</p><p>people yeah they&rsquo;re like 200 which means</p><p>they&rsquo;re eating a lot of carbohydrates to</p><p>the people to push down that sugar</p><p>so I think I think I was in the low end</p><p>so I guess I was a a good behaving</p><p>diabetic all right compared to where I&rsquo;m</p><p>at today doc</p><p>yeah I think it was absolutely terrible</p><p>uh now that I look at it as like the</p><p>hindsight I&rsquo;m like oh my god there was</p><p>so much more to accomplish with the</p><p>correct system I you know obviously I&rsquo;ve</p><p>been close to you for many years now I</p><p>wish I would have paid attention earlier</p><p>doc uh a lot more in detail because my</p><p>life has dramatically changed even</p><p>though I was at the lowest end of</p><p>insulin use</p><p>um I was still using anywhere from 20</p><p>units a day on a good day</p><p>to 50 units a day on a day in which I</p><p>misbehaved meaning that I I tried a</p><p>couple of pizza slices I got four kids</p><p>so things in my kitchen can get crazy so</p><p>I I maybe put things in my mouth that I</p><p>shouldn&rsquo;t have so you know then we go</p><p>into insulin resistance problems and</p><p>other things because as I eat that stuff</p><p>my body cannot handle it like if I had a</p><p>piece of pizza and I have to</p><p>dramatically increase my insulin use so</p><p>on a bad day 50 maybe even six units of</p><p>insulin that my body&rsquo;s not responding to</p><p>that was and I felt that I was pretty</p><p>decent because like you said right now</p><p>40 to 80 is the average I think I was</p><p>generally in the lowest side of things</p><p>so that&rsquo;s not it wasn&rsquo;t terrible right</p><p>now I can tell you it is terrible</p><p>so so</p><p>um so you get on keto you start doing</p><p>fasting</p><p>um all of a sudden this is an adjustment</p><p>you&rsquo;re like well wait a second I&rsquo;m</p><p>taking a lot less insulin you probably</p><p>even nervous you&rsquo;re taking so so small</p><p>amounts like you you went down to uh</p><p>what was correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong but it</p><p>was like three units or something units</p><p>three units right now a bad day for me a</p><p>bad day is five units of insulin you</p><p>know what I told you I told your dog</p><p>that uh 20 was a good day 50 is a bad</p><p>day so right now I I went down to two on</p><p>a good day and five on a bad day all</p><p>right and it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s pretty dramatic</p><p>so like based on on my theory at the</p><p>beginning of the interview which you</p><p>said that who knows maybe I was not even</p><p>a type 1 to begin with ever so</p><p>I&rsquo;ve been decreasing it so so the one</p><p>thing that I found is the the long</p><p>acting one I use one called Lantus uh</p><p>the long acting one I&rsquo;ve been lowering</p><p>it and I&rsquo;m doing I went from 25 to Now</p><p>using 10 a day this is one time a day 10</p><p>units so that one is the one that I have</p><p>felt that is the most important one that</p><p>if I completely take it away like here&rsquo;s</p><p>the thing I&rsquo;m only eating once a day</p><p>right now and I love it and I&rsquo;m not</p><p>hungry like something that we can talk</p><p>about too like I I really it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s it</p><p>gives me goosebumps because it&rsquo;s an</p><p>experience that I I didn&rsquo;t even know was</p><p>possible like the whole thing of one</p><p>meal a day I was like this is not</p><p>realize it&rsquo;s not superhuman I can&rsquo;t do</p><p>that now it&rsquo;s just for me really normal</p><p>like I I can go by an entire day and not</p><p>feel hungry and it&rsquo;s amazing and you</p><p>kind of transition and so you go for the</p><p>path of like first the addiction to food</p><p>and the impulses of food then you get</p><p>out of the addiction and now it&rsquo;s a</p><p>mental side of things so now you move</p><p>out of the mental</p><p>limiting factor that you cannot do that</p><p>and now it&rsquo;s like oh wow so I don&rsquo;t</p><p>really need this this doesn&rsquo;t make sense</p><p>those french fries they&rsquo;re not mine I</p><p>don&rsquo;t want to put them on my body and</p><p>and even though I have this enormous</p><p>movement in my house because I have five</p><p>humans living on the house and all these</p><p>little humans that eat all kinds of</p><p>stuff</p><p>I don&rsquo;t put any of that stuff in my body</p><p>so it&rsquo;s been a dramatic change and I</p><p>think it&rsquo;s been now I&rsquo;m on the eighth uh</p><p>full week of like behaving well uh I</p><p>think maybe I broke it once or twice</p><p>very lightly and but but it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a</p><p>it&rsquo;s a great thing to to make food</p><p>um the diet something that is easy to do</p><p>it&rsquo;s not it&rsquo;s not painful like going</p><p>through the system uh doing the keto</p><p>diet intermittent fasting it really is</p><p>uh light work it&rsquo;s not really exhausting</p><p>it&rsquo;s not really difficult but I can tell</p><p>you this for anybody that hasn&rsquo;t gone</p><p>through that uh for the last 20 years I</p><p>felt it was impossible and I felt it</p><p>wasn&rsquo;t real and I just pushed myself for</p><p>about two to three weeks it was</p><p>difficult but once I got through that</p><p>period then now I&rsquo;m just cruising it</p><p>really is like optional uh to you know</p><p>the things that I put in my body are are</p><p>not in uh so this training so this</p><p>transition period I want to talk about</p><p>that because I I kind of were back and</p><p>forth talking about the transition</p><p>because you&rsquo;re what happened was your</p><p>blood sugars went down to like 50 or</p><p>something it went too low right and so I</p><p>was using too much insulin yes so I</p><p>started every single night I was waking</p><p>up in the middle of the night four to</p><p>five times because my sugar levels were</p><p>dropping dropping dropping yeah yeah so</p><p>here you are uh on this trend and this</p><p>is why the transition is always tricky</p><p>you have to get supervision and all this</p><p>and get with your doctor to work with</p><p>you but what&rsquo;ll happen you keep taking</p><p>the same amount of insulin</p><p>and it goes the opposite direction</p><p>starts going down and then it gets too</p><p>low and you get shaky weak uh you know</p><p>fainting you know that type of stuff</p><p>um so what do they normally tell you eat</p><p>some sugar right</p><p>um I mentioned maybe have protein or or</p><p>something like that instead of the sugar</p><p>because then we just like spike it up</p><p>and then we bring it back down we need</p><p>more insulin so uh you you work that out</p><p>you worked it out and you kept adjusting</p><p>until you got The Sweet Spot</p><p>um you were a little concerned because</p><p>it was going like three three units I&rsquo;m</p><p>like well you know</p><p>that&rsquo;s the thing is like if your body</p><p>doesn&rsquo;t require all this insulin then</p><p>why are you giving it to it you know</p><p>it&rsquo;s like it just it has a function of</p><p>regulating blood sugar so if you&rsquo;re not</p><p>eating sugar and not and also eating</p><p>does trigger insulin too so because</p><p>you&rsquo;re doing one meal a day</p><p>uh that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s another point and then</p><p>the other point that happened with uh</p><p>Manuel is that he um</p><p>one night he ate a lot of protein and he</p><p>woke up I think you woke up in the</p><p>morning and your blood sugar was pretty</p><p>high right</p><p>yeah so so it&rsquo;s funny because uh</p><p>obviously I&rsquo;ve had the incredible</p><p>privilege of having you guide me a</p><p>little bit along the way and</p><p>um I had a late dinner uh one night and</p><p>it&rsquo;s breaking the routine I had a a</p><p>dinner somewhere around nine o&rsquo;clock I</p><p>ate a big steak and I thought that I was</p><p>doing something that was okay for my</p><p>body and I woke up with like very very</p><p>high sugar levels</p><p>um it was nine o&rsquo;clock at night when I</p><p>ate the steak so here&rsquo;s the thing about</p><p>protein as you mentioned</p><p>it just it&rsquo;s gonna It&rsquo;s Gonna Creep the</p><p>sugar levels up it&rsquo;s gonna do it now</p><p>it&rsquo;s not gonna do it</p><p>so quick like if you eat a a candy bar</p><p>or if you eat like a soda or something</p><p>but it will continue to creep it up so I</p><p>have a an app that I use to monitor my</p><p>sugar levels and it was I ate the piece</p><p>of steak at nine o&rsquo;clock at night and</p><p>all the way to 3 A.M the sugar level was</p><p>stable uh but it was slowly creeping up</p><p>um from 80 to 90 to 120 to 130 and then</p><p>I&rsquo;m at some point around four or five</p><p>a.m it just exploded and it went to the</p><p>200s and I ended up waking up with 285</p><p>or something around that and then I wake</p><p>up to a message which is almost like I</p><p>don&rsquo;t know if you were like uh reading</p><p>minds or some kind of experience that is</p><p>like Supernatural but then Dr Burke</p><p>sends me a message that says hey just so</p><p>you know Sugar Sugar sometimes a protein</p><p>when you have too much is going to</p><p>increase your sugar levels and I&rsquo;m like</p><p>what it&rsquo;s it hadn&rsquo;t happened to me</p><p>before so the timing was um</p><p>maybe 12 12 hours late doc because if I</p><p>would have gotten that message in the</p><p>night before I wouldn&rsquo;t have had that</p><p>big steak but it was it coincided with</p><p>me understanding and and getting that</p><p>lesson about also like listening view if</p><p>you have a a large amount of protein it</p><p>would also</p><p>um keep creeping up your sugar levels</p><p>and that&rsquo;s something to to keep in mind</p><p>now I&rsquo;ll I will mention guys that I used</p><p>to have</p><p>um my sugar bills that they sell for</p><p>diabetics it&rsquo;s a big item people buy it</p><p>a lot the the diabetics carry them in</p><p>their pockets and they use them</p><p>um as a solution to the low sugar</p><p>episodes because it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s very</p><p>difficult to replicate uh what your</p><p>pancreas does naturally so the diabetics</p><p>just eating all this trash being outside</p><p>a routine not really taking care of</p><p>their health they just eat eat and then</p><p>inject hoping to replicate what the</p><p>pancreas does naturally and they very</p><p>often fail here&rsquo;s a beautiful thing</p><p>I have a lot of those bills and I have</p><p>buckets and buckets of them doc I do not</p><p>use them anymore I don&rsquo;t use my sugar</p><p>pills</p><p>um I was using them back then when I was</p><p>going into the adjustment process of</p><p>like wait a second I don&rsquo;t need 25</p><p>minutes let me go to 20. oh that&rsquo;s still</p><p>too much let me go to 18. oh my God I&rsquo;m</p><p>still lowering 13 let me go to 12 let me</p><p>go to 10. like so I went for that</p><p>process and I had to use sugar bills</p><p>because a steak will not increase your</p><p>let&rsquo;s say that I wake up in the middle</p><p>of the night 1am and I have a low sugar</p><p>episode and it&rsquo;s at 47 or 52. I cannot</p><p>go to my kitchen and eat a piece of</p><p>steak because a steak will increase the</p><p>sugar but it will take a lot longer to</p><p>increase the sugar levels so my only</p><p>option at that point the adjustment was</p><p>like I need sugar right now because my</p><p>sugar levels are going down and I&rsquo;m</p><p>starting to sweat and it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s a</p><p>danger thing that your sugar levels go</p><p>too low the steak is going to take</p><p>longer to bring that sugar level up the</p><p>the point is that as I got into the</p><p>adjustment process I I the last time</p><p>that I used a sugar pill was probably</p><p>six weeks ago doc the last time so if I</p><p>show you my sugar levels they are stable</p><p>throughout the entire day and yes when I</p><p>eat too much protein like last night</p><p>perfect example we had another dinner I</p><p>went to a famous steakhouse here in</p><p>Tampa called Burns and uh I went with a</p><p>client of mine I had a big steak</p><p>somewhere around seven o&rsquo;clock eight</p><p>o&rsquo;clock not that late but that steak</p><p>gave me some trouble because it just</p><p>keeps on going for hours and hours and</p><p>hours so I have a little bit higher</p><p>sugar level than usual but in general I</p><p>just put very little insulin and here&rsquo;s</p><p>the here&rsquo;s the other thing Doc insulin</p><p>becomes so much more effective when you</p><p>have you know this whole insulin</p><p>resistance thing it disappears so now if</p><p>let&rsquo;s say that I have a 190 back in the</p><p>day day maybe two months ago I would use</p><p>six or seven units to bring that down to</p><p>70 or 80. right now I put one unit and</p><p>it goes down to 100 or 280. so the</p><p>insulin my body really responds very</p><p>well just because I have this system or</p><p>this diet in place it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a win</p><p>across the board that&rsquo;s for sure</p><p>that&rsquo;s so true because you you start</p><p>your insulin becomes more sensitive and</p><p>responsive to the triggers so versus</p><p>before it just takes forever</p><p>um the other thing I want to bring up is</p><p>exercise right so you you mentioned when</p><p>you exercise you&rsquo;re like whoa the blood</p><p>sugars came down because you burned off</p><p>all those sugars but another thing you</p><p>could do too if they&rsquo;re high is you can</p><p>go exercise to burn off this sugar right</p><p>yeah so</p><p>um I I think that if you were to ask me</p><p>um what&rsquo;s the most important component</p><p>of everything that I&rsquo;ve done</p><p>um of course the diet is huge It&rsquo;s a</p><p>combination of all these things uh but</p><p>for me they&rsquo;re working out is something</p><p>that I have never done routinely and</p><p>it&rsquo;s very important for people to know</p><p>what are we talking about with working</p><p>out what type of workout because I&rsquo;m a</p><p>tennis player I play tennis since I was</p><p>like a little kid</p><p>that wasn&rsquo;t enough of a workout to give</p><p>me the results like it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s called Uh</p><p>aerobic aerobic uh exercise dog yeah so</p><p>so it&rsquo;s just not enough so I I started</p><p>doing in my case what worked out and I&rsquo;m</p><p>doing it three to four times a week</p><p>that&rsquo;s it uh but when I do it it almost</p><p>works like insulin I am using a machine</p><p>called tonal</p><p>um I&rsquo;m not necessarily promoting it I&rsquo;m</p><p>just saying this is my solution because</p><p>I&rsquo;m a very busy guy so I have a digital</p><p>weights machine attached to my my garage</p><p>and it&rsquo;s very cool there&rsquo;s many</p><p>variations of it</p><p>um whether you go to a gym or whatever</p><p>for me a workout routine of 30 minutes</p><p>three to four times a week that&rsquo;s all it</p><p>takes</p><p>that has been a major part of like my</p><p>body not needing a lot of insulin so I&rsquo;m</p><p>still like in that process like okay I</p><p>think I&rsquo;ve lost somewhere around 13</p><p>pounds in the last eight weeks uh I feel</p><p>energetic like in my case I used to have</p><p>like major 4 pm crashes those crashes</p><p>are gone like I have zero I have</p><p>consistent energy throughout the entire</p><p>day and people look at me and they say</p><p>even my daughter she&rsquo;s 13 years old and</p><p>she says Papa You Gotta Eat You Gotta</p><p>Eat something he&rsquo;s not all right and I&rsquo;m</p><p>like baby look at my sugar levels I&rsquo;m</p><p>great I&rsquo;m stable look at my energy look</p><p>at my face I am ready to go I don&rsquo;t</p><p>really need</p><p>um none of this stuff so it&rsquo;s hard for</p><p>people to adjust themselves and my</p><p>question becomes like who decided that</p><p>we needed to eat three times a day who&rsquo;s</p><p>the person that said hey we got it that</p><p>free meals a day it was a human being</p><p>that decided that at some point a long</p><p>time ago and that became like a trend</p><p>which everybody agreed to it instead of</p><p>like gotta find something that works for</p><p>you it makes you stronger look at me I&rsquo;m</p><p>high energy I&rsquo;m stable I&rsquo;m using less</p><p>medicine I I can guarantee you the</p><p>pharmaceutical industry is not gonna</p><p>like this but I don&rsquo;t need much medicine</p><p>anymore it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s so yeah I think</p><p>insulin is expensive too isn&rsquo;t it it&rsquo;s</p><p>very expensive</p><p>um I do unfortunately my company has</p><p>company insurance and uh it&rsquo;s still</p><p>expensive every time that I have to go</p><p>buy it</p><p>it&rsquo;s a few hundred dollars uh to right</p><p>to actually buy it uh it used to be a</p><p>lot more dog because if you if you</p><p>recall uh before the Obama Care</p><p>um if you didn&rsquo;t have a company</p><p>sponsored Insurance before Obamacare uh</p><p>you will not insured you will not be</p><p>insured you were already like too high</p><p>risk so the first 15 years of uh or my</p><p>first 13 years maybe of my diabetes I</p><p>used to pay 600</p><p>for a vial of insulin of the Lantus</p><p>insulin 600 for one vial and I had no</p><p>choice so much so that I actually lived</p><p>in Texas for many years and I used to</p><p>cross the border to Mexico so I can get</p><p>it over there</p><p>for sheep uh for a lot cheaper because</p><p>the United States will not be able to</p><p>give me something affordable so it&rsquo;s</p><p>it&rsquo;s such a big business it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s</p><p>insane that&rsquo;s why people are like maybe</p><p>Dr Berg and what you&rsquo;re doing dog to</p><p>educate the society it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s not really</p><p>something that they love because you&rsquo;re</p><p>you&rsquo;re you know I follow your advice and</p><p>I have to use like what is it 100 times</p><p>less I mean going from two units from 50</p><p>units to two units a day it&rsquo;s ridiculous</p><p>so there if we repeat that across the</p><p>board these people are going to lose a</p><p>lot of money but we&rsquo;re gonna lead so</p><p>much healthier lives and I remember my</p><p>Father which you knew Dr Burke he used</p><p>to tell me</p><p>um if I had to choose between High</p><p>insulin or high sugar he said Son</p><p>high sugar all right shoes high sugar uh</p><p>he believed and dog you can tell me your</p><p>opinion but his opinion was also with</p><p>with his research that insulin is more</p><p>destructive in your body over the long</p><p>term than high sugar and that&rsquo;s</p><p>something that I learned from him I</p><p>don&rsquo;t know what your thoughts are on</p><p>this yeah well if you um if you just</p><p>look up</p><p>hyperinsulinemia and just you can just</p><p>do Wiki and look at all the side effects</p><p>you&rsquo;ll see exactly what it does I mean</p><p>because that they used to do insulin</p><p>shock therapy and put people in the</p><p>Comas and I mean it&rsquo;s just it&rsquo;s just it</p><p>really</p><p>um is bad</p><p>um one last tip I&rsquo;m going to recommend</p><p>for you since we&rsquo;ve been going back and</p><p>forth and for anyone else watching if</p><p>you&rsquo;re doing omad and you&rsquo;re especially</p><p>a type one or a type two</p><p>um if you had your last meal at the day</p><p>or the only meal at between two and</p><p>three</p><p>you would probably optimize your results</p><p>um I did a video on that</p><p>shifting your timing when you eat</p><p>because you&rsquo;re aligning your meals with</p><p>your circadian rhythms of your body and</p><p>so you&rsquo;ll just you&rsquo;ll get a little bit</p><p>better results with everything if you do</p><p>that compared to eating too early or too</p><p>late so I&rsquo;m not saying do that every</p><p>time but if you can shoot for that even</p><p>though it doesn&rsquo;t fit with the social</p><p>you know any type of social Customs or</p><p>anything that would be the optimum time</p><p>that&rsquo;s when I&rsquo;m doing my my one meal of</p><p>the day right now and I like it um</p><p>but anyway I wanted just to um don&rsquo;t</p><p>want to take too much of your time and I</p><p>wanted just to kind of ask you some</p><p>questions about this I think this is</p><p>going to be helpful for people that are</p><p>type one and just give them some hope</p><p>that uh maybe they can lower their their</p><p>need for that insulin that would be I</p><p>think a good thing I think overall</p><p>extend their lives that that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m</p><p>really looking forward to I really feel</p><p>that my life which obviously I want to</p><p>live as long as possible as healthy as</p><p>possible my life is going to be longer</p><p>because of doing this and talking about</p><p>your one meal a day dog that you just</p><p>mentioned right now here&rsquo;s the thing</p><p>about it I now look forward to my meal</p><p>and it&rsquo;s that period it&rsquo;s almost like a</p><p>religious half an hour like I just like</p><p>I don&rsquo;t want anybody to interrupt me the</p><p>kid seems to stay away from me you know</p><p>everybody knows like this is this is</p><p>this is that space uh and I I gotta try</p><p>to 2PM it doesn&rsquo;t interrupt the middle</p><p>of the day that the one thing that I</p><p>have experienced I TR I did try at 4 P.M</p><p>and then I I was a little bit too hungry</p><p>at midnight and it kind of gave me some</p><p>trouble sleeping so again I&rsquo;m still</p><p>trying out different things the one that</p><p>I&rsquo;m doing right now that has worked out</p><p>the best for me has been at 16 M meal 6</p><p>p.m that&rsquo;s it so right now for example</p><p>as we&rsquo;re recording this it&rsquo;s 1 30 PM I</p><p>have no food in the entire day I&rsquo;ve had</p><p>your electrolytes Dr Berg electrolytes I</p><p>love them and they travel with me and</p><p>they&rsquo;re amazing and I don&rsquo;t know why doc</p><p>but they take away when I get a little</p><p>bit anxious or hungry I just have an</p><p>electrolyte cup and it&rsquo;s it goes away</p><p>and I I go back to operating like I</p><p>don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s supposed to do that</p><p>I just feel better with them so I love</p><p>the electrolytes uh so I do that and I&rsquo;m</p><p>taking obviously nutritional yeast and a</p><p>few of your stuff which is I really is</p><p>it really is helpful but at 6 PM I have</p><p>a pretty big dinner and one of my</p><p>favorite things that I do no matter what</p><p>I eat I always have an entire avocado</p><p>and I&rsquo;ll put a lot of olive oil in it</p><p>and then I&rsquo;ll have my meal with a little</p><p>bit of protein a lot of salad and I feel</p><p>like even like I don&rsquo;t have to eat a big</p><p>plate because now</p><p>what has also happened is that I get</p><p>full much much faster so almost like</p><p>almost like the people that get</p><p>surgeries like I have no surgeries but</p><p>you know they they say about the uh the</p><p>gastro whatever surgery that they get</p><p>that they make the stomach smaller I</p><p>feel like my stomach has gotten smaller</p><p>just because of the diet I don&rsquo;t I&rsquo;m not</p><p>that hungry right that&rsquo;s right so at 6</p><p>PM I&rsquo;m done with the meal at 6 30 p.m</p><p>and then I&rsquo;m just relax the entire rest</p><p>of the day until finally it&rsquo;s bedtime 10</p><p>30 o&rsquo;clock 11 o&rsquo;clock at night I&rsquo;m still</p><p>full and I wake up also just have my</p><p>coffee</p><p>um and sometimes I break the fast with</p><p>like coffee with cream sometimes I
