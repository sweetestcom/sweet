<p>thank you</p>
<p>all right welcome back everyone</p>
<p>hopefully you can hear me</p>
<p>um anything that I say is not meant to</p>
<p>bypass your medical doctor check with</p>
<p>your doctor before implementing any of</p>
<p>these in from any any tips that we give</p>
<p>today or anything that even resembles a</p>
<p>curing of any diseases</p>
<p>so um</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s Dive Right In Steve can you hear</p>

<p>step further</p>
<p>um Sahar can you hear us</p>
<p>oh good so the audience can hear us and</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to do this sort of Rube</p>
<p>Goldberg thing and Dr Berg&rsquo;s going to</p>

<p>let&rsquo;s see Sahar would you say something</p>
<p>I want to make sure that Dr Berg can</p>
<p>hear you</p>
<p>yes hi</p>
<p>can you can you</p>
<p>Dr Byrd can you hear Sahar do you have</p>
<p>your say that again</p>

<p>something well</p>
<p>this is live problem on the air audience</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t this exciting uh let&rsquo;s see</p>
<p>hold on okay say something again Steve</p>
<p>testing one two three okay</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re good oh that&rsquo;s great all</p>
<p>right let&rsquo;s just pretend that didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>happen uh show uh audience and let&rsquo;s say</p>
<p>speaking of Sahar let me introduce him</p>
<p>to you uh and Sahar is a Frenchman and</p>
<p>he said I hope my uh accent doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>create any issues and I said well we</p>
<p>just allowed the French on the air last</p>
<p>week so that&rsquo;s good perfect timing and</p>
<p>he said I&rsquo;m from China and I thought</p>
<p>well that&rsquo;s some exotic Countryside town</p>
<p>in France but in fact it is China so</p>
<p>poor uh Theory the Frenchman is in China</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s 10 30 at night I know that&rsquo;s a long</p>
<p>explanation but that&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>bringing him on the air first so unmute</p>
<p>yourself Theory and hit it with your one</p>
<p>question in 30 seconds</p>
<p>okay hi Dr Berg thank you for having me</p>
<p>on your show so my question is is it</p>
<p>normal to have a blood sugar level as</p>
<p>low as 2.7 mmol per liter after 36 hour</p>
<p>of water fasting for a person who&rsquo;s got</p>
<p>three cancer</p>
<p>and is there a minimum</p>
<p>because I can&rsquo;t hear in terms of low</p>
<p>blood sugar level oh is he unmuted on</p>
<p>your screen doc</p>
<p>okay I tell you what yeah we are</p>
<p>we are still having an issue I can just</p>
<p>tell me I sure will tell me the question</p>
<p>okay Theory would you uh make that uh</p>
<p>say that again to me concisely and I</p>
<p>will relay it to Dr Byrd</p>
<p>okay so uh so I wanted to say I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know if he heard me so I wanted to say</p>
<p>thank you for Dr to Dr Burke for having</p>
<p>me on his show wonderful and uh so the</p>
<p>question the question is is it normal to</p>
<p>have a blood sugar level as low as 2.7</p>
<p>mmol per liter after 36 hours of water</p>
<p>fasting for a person who&rsquo;s got thyroid</p>
<p>cancer and is there a minimum a limit to</p>
<p>do not cross in terms of low blood sugar</p>
<p>level during during long fasting okay so</p>
<p>uh he has thyroid cancer and he had a</p>
<p>blood yes it&rsquo;s someone close to me</p>
<p>basically oh I&rsquo;m sorry okay well he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>talking about person and the blood sugar</p>
<p>was 2.07 I guess that&rsquo;s the A1C and is</p>
<p>it normal you know to have that he was</p>
<p>on a water or this person was on a water</p>
<p>fast for two or three days is it normal</p>
<p>to have such a low blood sugar</p>
<p>um well yeah because you&rsquo;re not eating</p>
<p>anything it the real key thing to really</p>
<p>make sure that it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s okay is how you</p>
<p>feel in other words when the blood</p>
<p>sugars go when you get on keto or do</p>
<p>fasting especially prolonged fasting</p>
<p>um sometimes the Bible will just</p>
<p>compensate and just make more sugar</p>
<p>because the red blood cell uh can only</p>
<p>live on sugar and so anything it needs</p>
<p>it will make from the liver it&rsquo;s called</p>
<p>gluconeogenesis but in your case</p>
<p>if you have low blood glucose and you</p>
<p>feel okay</p>
<p>then your body is okay it&rsquo;s just your</p>
<p>body is just running on more ketones and</p>
<p>not glucose</p>
<p>so if you feel terrible and weak and you</p>
<p>know that means that you need to eat so</p>
<p>I would go by how you feel and even</p>
<p>though the blood sugars might be lower</p>
<p>than usual</p>
<p>um if you feel okay it&rsquo;s just because</p>
<p>your body is adapting it it&rsquo;s running on</p>
<p>different types of fuel</p>
<p>very good okay well etherea I hope that</p>
<p>helps your friend and we&rsquo;d love to hear</p>
<p>back from you uh you know in the future</p>
<p>to see how that person is doing and I</p>
<p>hope that that offers some remedy but</p>
<p>anyway once it gets to confirmed so that</p>
<p>low blood sugar number as long as you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>feeling good shouldn&rsquo;t be a problem</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re not eating sugar you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not eating anything</p>
<p>so thank you sir for that go get some</p>
<p>sleep and I appreciate you staying all</p>
<p>with us all right now luckily you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have you don&rsquo;t have to hear the</p>
<p>questions I will um</p>
<p>read them for you so let&rsquo;s go to social</p>
<p>media edema from YouTube I&rsquo;ve heard from</p>
<p>other doctors that going long periods</p>
<p>with carbohydrates can actually cause</p>
<p>insulin resistance is this true</p>
<p>okay so going long periods of times</p>
<p>without carbohydrates no with</p>
<p>carbohydrates yeah will cause insulin</p>
<p>resistance</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s exactly what causes it</p>
<p>exactly what caused it well eating uh</p>
<p>refined carbs or sugar for a long period</p>
<p>of time will create insulin resistance</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s your body&rsquo;s trying to</p>
<p>protect against this this is called</p>
<p>glucotoxicity there&rsquo;s too much blood</p>
<p>sugar too much uh too much sugar so your</p>
<p>body doesn&rsquo;t like it so it it develops</p>
<p>resistance to it and that also includes</p>
<p>the resistance to insulin which is the</p>
<p>kind of the hormone that&rsquo;s trying to</p>
<p>regulate this sugar it&rsquo;ll start it just</p>
<p>won&rsquo;t um</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll kind of block the sugar from</p>
<p>going in as well as uh you know insulin</p>
<p>itself because insulin has other</p>
<p>functions as well</p>
<p>all right well Karen from YouTube would</p>
<p>like to know is the carnivore diet the</p>
<p>fastest way to alleviate sibo</p>
<p>uh I think it&rsquo;s uh it&rsquo;s very helpful I</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s very helpful because</p>
<p>you have fermentation in your small</p>
<p>intestine you have microbes in the wrong</p>
<p>place and they should be in the large</p>
<p>intestine and so if you don&rsquo;t feed it</p>
<p>fiber and do more carnivore that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>really smart but I would also add in</p>
<p>there doing intermittent fasting</p>
<p>probably some betaine hydrochloride to</p>
<p>acidify the stomach as well as maybe</p>
<p>some garlic tablets which is not</p>
<p>carnivore but it&rsquo;s uh it&rsquo;s kind of a</p>
<p>natural antibiotic that could help so</p>
<p>yes that that&rsquo;s what I would do if I</p>
<p>were you all right very good and let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>see Beetlejuice as he&rsquo;s calling himself</p>
<p>from YouTube because of you and Dr</p>
<p>gandry perhaps one of your colleagues or</p>
<p>friends I have lost 130 pounds</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s fantastic well keep it up I</p>
<p>assume use keto and intermittent fasting</p>
<p>all those great things so you know you&rsquo;d</p>
<p>be a great before after story so</p>
<p>drberg.com go on there if you haven&rsquo;t</p>
<p>already uh done that he&rsquo;s got how many</p>
<p>Dr Burke 7 000 or something uh success</p>
<p>stories it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a lot more but we just</p>
<p>only collected seven thousand because we</p>
<p>started very recently I wish I would</p>
<p>have started in the beginning we would</p>
<p>have had definitely over at least eight</p>
<p>eight thousand I&rsquo;m being very sarcastic</p>
<p>we&rsquo;d be well over twenty twenty thousand</p>
<p>wow that&rsquo;s fantastic well good for you</p>
<p>thanks for that great news and in in</p>
<p>spite of our little technical issues</p>
<p>this morning we still have fans around</p>
<p>the world and we&rsquo;d like to say a good</p>
<p>morning to them uh from those joining us</p>
<p>today from the UK Canada Mexico Jordan</p>
<p>India Zambia the Netherlands Oman</p>
<p>Tanzania New Zealand Spain Greece uh</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s see Nigeria Bermuda Japan the</p>
<p>United Arab Emirates Peru Israel</p>
<p>Colombia Dubai Brunei Norway Germany</p>
<p>Russia uh Ghana the Philippines aratria</p>
<p>Ireland France Jamaica</p>
<p>Australia Portugal Scotland Sweden Japan</p>
<p>if I already said that Brazil Trinidad</p>
<p>and Tobago Albania Kuwait the Czech</p>
<p>Republic Nicaragua Cyprus South Korea</p>
<p>Iran Qatar Saudi Arabia South Korea</p>
<p>say that no maybe I didn&rsquo;t anyway</p>
<p>Armenia Finland South Africa Ireland</p>
<p>Slovakia Ethiopia Egypt the Bahamas</p>
<p>Croatia Switzerland beautiful place and</p>
<p>all across the United States so thanks</p>
<p>for hanging in with us folks uh and for</p>
<p>all your great questions and so on uh</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s go ahead and launch the first</p>
<p>question of the day and Dr Burke there</p>
<p>it is</p>
<p>okay question shortness of breath</p>
<p>um not related to lung or heart problems</p>
<p>is usually caused by blank</p>
<p>all right folks climb on that</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll be peppy in your</p>
<p>answers as usual Janice from YouTube is</p>
<p>there a test to measure our glutathione</p>
<p>levels and Terry thank you for doing</p>
<p>that phonetically for me</p>
<p>yes there is you can check uh check this</p>
<p>indirectly you can check the precursors</p>
<p>glutamine for example you can test that</p>
<p>um there&rsquo;s I&rsquo;m going to be talking more</p>
<p>about this but since you brought it up</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll I&rsquo;ll just kind of tell you what I</p>
<p>would or what we&rsquo;re going to be talking</p>
<p>about very soon</p>
<p>um is it&rsquo;s called metabolomic testing</p>
<p>um and this testing allows to look at</p>
<p>all these different</p>
<p>additional things that are that go Way</p>
<p>Beyond just a simple blood test and so</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re looking at all this information</p>
<p>as it relates to your biochemistry</p>
<p>including glutathione which is one of</p>
<p>the most potent antioxidants that your</p>
<p>body makes for a lot of different</p>
<p>reasons</p>
<p>and so</p>
<p>um on that test you can pick it right up</p>
<p>on a metabolomic test you could pick it</p>
<p>up and see if you need to actually be</p>
<p>building up the precursors so you can</p>
<p>build up that antioxidant so yeah you</p>
<p>can definitely check it</p>
<p>um and it&rsquo;s extremely valuable because</p>
<p>you can see</p>
<p>really what nutrition you need at the</p>
<p>cellular level versus just like a blood</p>
<p>test so stay tuned for more information</p>
<p>on that</p>
<p>all right very good let&rsquo;s see um</p>
<p>JD from YouTube is there a natural way</p>
<p>to lower estrogen I&rsquo;ve been using</p>
<p>letrozole so far</p>
<p>there is a natural way and cruciferous</p>
<p>vegetables</p>
<p>are a good</p>
<p>as well as iodine from sea kelp</p>
<p>and you can also use a product called</p>
<p>dim</p>
<p>which is a kind of an extract of the</p>
<p>cruciferous so that will help as well</p>
<p>okay uh mirjana uh poor thing is</p>
<p>suffering from uh sleep problems uh</p>
<p>Sleep Disorders what are the most common</p>
<p>causes and she would probably also like</p>
<p>to know what are the most common and I</p>
<p>won&rsquo;t say cures but remedies or whatever</p>
<p>uh you&rsquo;re talking about for what</p>
<p>specific condition a sleep disorder well</p>
<p>I guess not sleeping is my guess</p>
<p>yeah so so you have sleep apnea and you</p>
<p>have different just regular sleep</p>
<p>problems and like getting to sleep</p>
<p>staying asleep there&rsquo;s many different</p>
<p>parts of it so let&rsquo;s say for example</p>
<p>you have sleep apnea okay then what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to help you is to get on the keto</p>
<p>diet in intermittent fasting immediately</p>
<p>so you can lose weight and also get rid</p>
<p>of some of the</p>
<p>the extra fat that surrounds the the</p>
<p>neck and that could be obstructing the</p>
<p>air but also insulin resistance once you</p>
<p>improve that situation you&rsquo;ll be able to</p>
<p>reduce the problems with sleep apnea the</p>
<p>thing with sleep apnea is that if you</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s things you can do to improve it</p>
<p>like um in your room for example keep</p>
<p>the window open so you&rsquo;re getting more</p>
<p>oxygen to try to start practicing</p>
<p>breathing through your nose</p>
<p>and um</p>
<p>those are some simple things</p>
<p>generally if you can&rsquo;t get to sleep</p>
<p>and what happens is that you need to be</p>
<p>be one right before bed because that</p>
<p>will turn off that</p>
<p>excessive thinking problem that a lot of</p>
<p>people have</p>
<p>and also magnesium is a good thing to</p>
<p>take before bed uh dimming the lights</p>
<p>you know</p>
<p>towards the evening will help you sleep</p>
<p>better there are so many things you can</p>
<p>do and also nutritionally as well like</p>
<p>you can try zinc and vitamin D directly</p>
<p>have an effect on your sleep cycles</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>and but I think the big reason why</p>
<p>people can&rsquo;t sleep is stress so during</p>
<p>the day going for long walks not</p>
<p>spending too much time on the computer</p>
<p>doing physical work around the house are</p>
<p>going to be really important to help you</p>
<p>sleep so</p>
<p>um but there&rsquo;s a lot more so search up</p>
<p>my videos for that that&rsquo;s wonderful you</p>
<p>know a quick aside here I was listening</p>
<p>to an interview on some uh National</p>
<p>radio station with this famous author</p>
<p>whose name I can&rsquo;t remember but he&rsquo;d</p>
<p>done everything you&rsquo;ve been all over the</p>
<p>world written books seen everything</p>
<p>sailed around the world and they said</p>
<p>you know you&rsquo;ve done everything if there</p>
<p>was anything you could change what would</p>
<p>it be and he said speaking of stress I</p>
<p>just wish I hadn&rsquo;t worried so much every</p>
<p>day I thought the other shoe was going</p>
<p>to drop and in spite of all the great</p>
<p>things that happened I was worried sick</p>
<p>my entire life because now I&rsquo;m 80</p>
<p>whatever it is and none of it happened</p>
<p>he said can you imagine what a great</p>
<p>life I&rsquo;d have had if I just accepted you</p>
<p>know the glory of each day and not</p>
<p>worried about what tomorrow would bring</p>
<p>and I just that never left me so you</p>
<p>know yeah just lived it I don&rsquo;t worry</p>
<p>about tomorrow can&rsquo;t do anything about</p>
<p>it and sleep well for goodness sakes</p>
<p>I tell you just on that note it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>interesting how much</p>
<p>stress is manufactured</p>
<p>unnecessarily I mean it&rsquo;s being pumped</p>
<p>out</p>
<p>sensationalism news media that type of</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like it gets everyone excited and</p>
<p>hyped up and adrenals start flooding so</p>
<p>how much of that is manufactured it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just crazy high so you&rsquo;re right it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like you have to go through life without</p>
<p>more of a relaxed attitude and uh</p>
<p>you know keep keep it light and do</p>
<p>things to keep the stress off you</p>
<p>because</p>
<p>um stress</p>
<p>is literally almost equivalent to eating</p>
<p>sugar because what it&rsquo;s a the hormone</p>
<p>that it activates is called cortisol</p>
<p>which is also called a glucocorticoid</p>
<p>which means it regulates blood glucose I</p>
<p>mean if you take a look at even the</p>
<p>diseases that are affected by</p>
<p>cortisol and stress and ulcer</p>
<p>heart attacks stroke sleeping problems</p>
<p>um diabetes</p>
<p>yes diabetes too from distress so pretty</p>
<p>much um that&rsquo;s like the the other huge</p>
<p>factor in addition to</p>
<p>going on the wrong diet so</p>
<p>a lot um just as a side note Steve um</p>
<p>as everyone probably already knows</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s quite a few videos that</p>
<p>I had to take down off of YouTube and</p>
<p>then and I certain things I can&rsquo;t talk</p>
<p>about so just want to let you know if</p>
<p>you go to rumble and sign up I I am</p>
<p>going to put all those videos there and</p>
<p>I could speak more freely and Rumble so</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s uh it&rsquo;s something that you can look</p>
<p>me up and uh still get all the</p>
<p>information because it&rsquo;s becoming more</p>
<p>difficult too</p>
<p>um find information on on my topics uh</p>
<p>on YouTube but I&rsquo;ll still be there but</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s certain things I can&rsquo;t talk</p>
<p>about that I want to talk about</p>
<p>all right well I think they&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>let us talk about Big Bad Bill from</p>
<p>YouTube who two years ago lost nearly 40</p>
<p>pounds good for you on intermittent</p>
<p>fasting I did 24 intervals so 20 fast</p>
<p>for eating five days a week for eight</p>
<p>months now all my weight has come back</p>
<p>so big bad Bill is indeed big again and</p>
<p>he wants to know what he should do</p>
<p>go back to whatever worked before</p>
<p>um do what work it&rsquo;s kind of there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s two things that are very very</p>
<p>very simple very very important</p>
<p>if something works</p>
<p>keep doing it if it doesn&rsquo;t work then</p>
<p>change it</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s what I would do it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>especially if you if lost on keto and</p>
<p>intermittent fasting and then find out</p>
<p>go back to it just do it again it will</p>
<p>if it worked before it will work again I</p>
<p>promise you yeah it&rsquo;s easy to kind of</p>
<p>slide off a little bit well a little bit</p>
<p>this won&rsquo;t hurt all of a sudden there</p>
<p>you go and what does the doctor say or</p>
<p>the patient says gosh it really hurts</p>
<p>when I do this well then don&rsquo;t do that</p>
<p>right so all that that advice let&rsquo;s see</p>
<p>um we talked about sleep disorder and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure Terry is coming up with a quiz</p>
<p>question should be back here let&rsquo;s see</p>
<p>uh Beverly from YouTube if you&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>tested positive for mycotoxins and</p>
<p>parasites what should the steps be to</p>
<p>resolve these conditions thank you she</p>
<p>says</p>
<p>black walnut Halls oh no oh I&rsquo;m sorry go</p>
<p>ahead I thought you were asking me what</p>
<p>you said continue Dr sorry black walnut</p>
<p>Hall&rsquo;s clove garlic</p>
<p>um wormwood extract these are all things</p>
<p>that are wonderful for parasites and</p>
<p>other microbes that you want to get rid</p>
<p>of so you want to take them but um</p>
<p>um you know start small and work up to</p>
<p>it because it can actually create a</p>
<p>detox reaction and of course one thing</p>
<p>that I do know that some of these</p>
<p>parasites and yeasts and fungus and mold</p>
<p>lives off of especially when it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>an overgrowth is sugar and milk sugar so</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to have to avoid that food</p>
<p>as well but um yeah but for parasites</p>
<p>and things uh you want to do some of</p>
<p>these um very powerful herbs wormwood is</p>
<p>a really good one as well and then black</p>
<p>walnut Halls</p>
<p>okay very good let&rsquo;s see so Mr Craig</p>
<p>from YouTube wants your advice or</p>
<p>thoughts rather on taking creatine is it</p>
<p>safe</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s totally safe and it&rsquo;s good for</p>
<p>people that want more energy that want</p>
<p>or also want to um</p>
<p>potentially build more muscle so it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>totally safe thing you could take it and</p>
<p>uh</p>
<p>um it can be helpful I I did a video on</p>
<p>it recently so you can check that out</p>
<p>all right very good uh let&rsquo;s see let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>talk about our first quiz questions that</p>
<p>the audience left on and it asks</p>
<p>shortness of breath not related to lung</p>
<p>or heart problems is usually caused by</p>
<p>uh drum roll 45 percent of respondents</p>
<p>say it&rsquo;s obesity 30 say it&rsquo;s copper or</p>
<p>zinc deficiency 15 say it&rsquo;s a thyroid</p>
<p>issue and ten percent say it&rsquo;s anxiety</p>
<p>which we talked about</p>
<p>okay so some really great data on this</p>
<p>um it&rsquo;s called sudo dyspnea where you</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t breathe</p>
<p>um but it&rsquo;s not coming from a heart or</p>
<p>lung</p>
<p>um it&rsquo;s usually something related to</p>
<p>either acid reflux or gerd or silent</p>
<p>reflux which basically you don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>the heartburn but you have the reflex</p>
<p>and that can irritate uh and destroy the</p>
<p>nerves which will cause you to feel like</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gasping for more air which can</p>
<p>then increase your CO2 and</p>
<p>and throw off the breathing a bit so</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>the other thing that&rsquo;s related to that</p>
<p>is that anytime someone has heartburn or</p>
<p>gas it or gerd usually they don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>enough acid</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t have enough acid and then</p>
<p>when they take</p>
<p>um an acid they get rid of even that</p>
<p>little bit that they had and they start</p>
<p>developing something called respiratory</p>
<p>alkalosis which can affect your</p>
<p>breathing even more because that messes</p>
<p>with CO2 so I mean this this whole Chain</p>
<p>Reaction thing that occurs with um</p>
<p>with the breathing problem that</p>
<p>I mean if you look up the cause of this</p>
<p>on various uh</p>
<p>you know medical sites it&rsquo;ll say unknown</p>
<p>cause unknown cause unknown cause but</p>
<p>you have to just think beyond the</p>
<p>symptom and not just treat it like a</p>
<p>like a problem but like trying to</p>
<p>understand it other other than that</p>
<p>there could be also a a problem with</p>
<p>uh your middle back your mid back your</p>
<p>rib is kind of stuck from an old injury</p>
<p>of something and that obstructs the</p>
<p>breathing as well</p>
<p>um I had that problem uh from multiple</p>
<p>injuries and then also um if your</p>
<p>gallbladder</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>is congested that can put pressure on</p>
<p>the diaphragm which then affects your</p>
<p>breathing so in which case you need that</p>
<p>Tad cut that I always talk about tug cut</p>
<p>you take two empty stomach in the</p>
<p>morning two in the afternoon and that</p>
<p>allows things to drain through but of</p>
<p>course ultimately you&rsquo;re gonna have to</p>
<p>change your diet but these are just some</p>
<p>things that</p>
<p>um I will release a video on so if you</p>
<p>have a breathing problem which will</p>
<p>cause anxiety or air hunger there&rsquo;s some</p>
<p>great solutions that you can you know</p>
<p>solve this mystery with all right very</p>
<p>good Janet I see you out there we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to ask your question in just a</p>
<p>minute but first let&rsquo;s ask the big</p>
<p>question there&rsquo;s number two for the day</p>
<p>of true falcer</p>
<p>okay true or false having high blood</p>
<p>sugars not uh</p>
<p>related to eating sugar</p>
<p>or carbs is still pathogenic</p>
<p>able to cause a disease so in other</p>
<p>words let&rsquo;s say you have high blood</p>
<p>glucose</p>
<p>okay and um</p>
<p>uh and this is the true or false so</p>
<p>um it&rsquo;s still pathogenic despite the</p>
<p>causes let&rsquo;s let&rsquo;s say you you have high</p>
<p>blood sugar and you didn&rsquo;t have carbs or</p>
<p>sugar is that still a problem like a</p>
<p>pathogenic issue</p>
<p>all right very good climb on that</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s see</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>oh here we go Deborah from YouTube I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>rooting for you Deborah how bad is it to</p>
<p>still have some small amounts of wine on</p>
<p>the keto or carnivore diet</p>
<p>yeah here&rsquo;s the problem uh the problem</p>
<p>is that just a little bit of wine</p>
<p>can really set you back for even up to</p>
<p>48 hours so let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re doing wine</p>
<p>every third day</p>
<p>yeah you&rsquo;re not going to really get into</p>
<p>ketosis that well the other thing that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>interesting about alcohol in general is</p>
<p>the body will</p>
<p>consider this a priority to get rid to</p>
<p>detoxify it so it kind of shuts down</p>
<p>other functions of digestion</p>
<p>in this dominant role of let&rsquo;s get rid</p>
<p>of this poison and so it definitely</p>
<p>affects</p>
<p>your liver and your blood sugars and a</p>
<p>lot of other issues as well so I</p>
<p>I know you&rsquo;re not going to be happy with</p>
<p>my answer but I would say</p>
<p>yeah probably not not drink it very</p>
<p>often bummer Deborah and I did promise</p>
<p>Janet and then I went to Deborah but</p>
<p>anyway Janet from Facebook our low</p>
<p>cortisol levels are problem that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>interesting question</p>
<p>yes it&rsquo;s just it&rsquo;s as much of a problem</p>
<p>as high uh cortisol huh and when you</p>
<p>have cortisol you lose the ability to</p>
<p>get rid of inflammation you lose the</p>
<p>ability to</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a reflection of your</p>
<p>adrenals the adrenals are weak so the</p>
<p>tolerance think about what cortisol does</p>
<p>is it adapts the body to a stress state</p>
<p>So to that degree if you can&rsquo;t adapt to</p>
<p>a stress day you&rsquo;re more fragile</p>
<p>and that can lead to a lot of problems</p>
<p>in the ability to exercise</p>
<p>and recover from exercise recover from</p>
<p>an injury</p>
<p>sleep cycles will be off usually</p>
<p>and so um</p>
<p>yeah there&rsquo;s um</p>
<p>if you have high levels of cortisol over</p>
<p>a long period of time like chronic</p>
<p>stress your body will also develop</p>
<p>something called cortisol resistance</p>
<p>similar to insulin resistance but you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>have actually low cortisol despite</p>
<p>having high cortisol in your blood so</p>
<p>again this is uh something that you</p>
<p>really got to understand the whole</p>
<p>mechanism and not just</p>
<p>oh you have high cortisol in your blood</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to treat you on that by</p>
<p>trying to do some</p>
<p>crazy thing when you really you really</p>
<p>have low cortisol inside the cells</p>
<p>boy a lot of moving Parts I can tell you</p>
<p>that right now let&rsquo;s see uh okay we have</p>
<p>answers for quiz question number two</p>
<p>which I have a typo and not related to</p>
<p>eating sugar true false high blood</p>
<p>sugars are not related to eating sugar</p>
<p>or carbs it&rsquo;s still pathogenic able to</p>
<p>cause disease and the audience has an</p>
<p>opinion on that and it is as follows 95</p>
<p>percent of our respondents say it&rsquo;s true</p>
<p>and five percent are holding out for</p>
<p>false</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s actually false wow guys good for</p>
<p>you</p>
<p>so if there&rsquo;s various reasons for having</p>
<p>high blood glucose that don&rsquo;t have to do</p>
<p>with eating sugar or carbs</p>
<p>that are not pathogenic</p>
<p>it does not going to result in a bad</p>
<p>situation like like the dawn phenomena</p>
<p>which actually believe it or not is</p>
<p>normal for a lot of people because at</p>
<p>eight o&rsquo;clock in the morning a.m your</p>
<p>cortisol spikes that cortisol will</p>
<p>release some sugar so that could be just</p>
<p>a normal</p>
<p>hormonal change</p>
<p>um it could be that you&rsquo;re exercising</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re releasing the sugar and then</p>
<p>you check your blood sugar well that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>normal especially if you&rsquo;re doing some</p>
<p>intense exercise or let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going through an infection or a stress</p>
<p>event and you have this spike in Sugar</p>
<p>you it&rsquo;s not going to turn out to it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>that extra little bit of sugar is not</p>
<p>going to be pathogenic it really has to</p>
<p>do and even if you check your A1C it&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>probably be normal over a period of time</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s it the the main problem with</p>
<p>with blood sugars is you eating carbs</p>
<p>and sugar or alcohol and that&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>be pathogenic</p>
<p>but I will release a video on it</p>
<p>okay very good now uh we started in</p>
<p>China it was 10 30 there so I think we</p>
<p>should take it uh along the lines of uh</p>
<p>longitude and we&rsquo;ll go to London this</p>
<p>time to Melissa Melissa if you will</p>
<p>unmute yourself uh we&rsquo;re going to put</p>
<p>you on so you can go to dinner I think</p>
<p>it must be about five o&rsquo;clock or 4 30</p>
<p>there so go on with your one question</p>
<p>remember in 30 seconds and Dr burrow</p>
<p>will please you with his answer hi</p>
<p>hi Dr Berg thank you for having me</p>
<p>um is there anything that you can advise</p>
<p>me to help me heal from something called</p>
<p>steroid withdrawal during pregnancy</p>
<p>because doctors only want to give me</p>
<p>prednisone and immunosuppressants</p>
<p>do you have a um miraculously I can hear</p>
<p>you so um so you&rsquo;re taking the steroids</p>
<p>because you have some</p>
<p>autoimmune or something different</p>
<p>yeah um I had everything eczema</p>
<p>you know</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s interesting is if you have a true</p>
<p>autoimmune typically when you get</p>
<p>pregnant</p>
<p>uh that autoimmune turns off are you</p>
<p>pregnant right now</p>
<p>yes I am 21 weeks let&rsquo;s have the problem</p>
<p>sorry you still have this uh this skin</p>
<p>problem</p>
<p>yeah</p>
<p>um it started in my first pregnancy</p>
<p>three years ago and I&rsquo;m pregnant again</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m still um dealing with it</p>
<p>it in theory it&rsquo;s supposed to you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>supposed to have that but I understand</p>
<p>you have it so unfortunately I think um</p>
<p>the best thing that you could do</p>
<p>uh as an uh cortisol prednisone</p>
<p>alternative and again this is just my</p>
<p>opinion</p>
<p>is to take high levels of vitamin D</p>
<p>yeah because that can act as an</p>
<p>anti-inflammatory</p>
<p>um that can act especially for skin</p>
<p>problems is something really good and</p>
<p>then also don&rsquo;t forget the the zinc as</p>
<p>well but those are the things that I</p>
<p>would do</p>
<p>um because as you know</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re pregnant and you don&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>to be taking steroids because uh it</p>
<p>throws off things but I&rsquo;m glad that you</p>
<p>asked that question I think also the</p>
<p>most important time to eat</p>
<p>perfectly is when you&rsquo;re pregnant and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re already eating perfectly</p>
<p>with everything you&rsquo;re eating but</p>
<p>sometimes they don&rsquo;t emphasize that they</p>
<p>say oh yeah eat what you want eat the</p>
<p>ice cream whatever you crave but</p>
<p>you want to give that child every chance</p>
<p>for getting all the nutrients that they</p>
<p>they need to develop a good structure</p>
<p>and vitamin D is at the top of the list</p>
<p>so you may even find those symptoms</p>
<p>diminished greatly with the vitamin D</p>
<p>itself because um</p>
<p>that it acts like cortisol but without</p>
<p>the side effects</p>
<p>thank you so much you&rsquo;re welcome well</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s wonderful congratulations on</p>
<p>getting preggers again and being able to</p>
<p>eat pickles I think that&rsquo;s what you</p>
<p>ladies do when you&rsquo;re pregnant so that</p>
<p>all sounds like a a lot of fun and get</p>
<p>back with us and bring the baby on the</p>
<p>air we all everyone loves babies it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>good for Ratings bring it back on and</p>
<p>let us know how that goes and say thanks</p>
<p>so much for taking your time out now at</p>
<p>4 30 I don&rsquo;t know what time you guys eat</p>
<p>over there but get out there and grab a</p>
<p>jar of pickles and have a blast okay so</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s see</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>a Havoc from YouTube what are your</p>
<p>suggestions to excuse me treat acid</p>
<p>reflux you kind of touched on that</p>
<p>already</p>
<p>the well the the acid reflux</p>
<p>is usually a lack of acid so you would</p>
<p>want to take betaine hydrochloride take</p>
<p>five before a meal to start out with you</p>
<p>might need a little bit more but that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what I would do and then I would the</p>
<p>only Catch-22 is if you have an ulcer if</p>
<p>you have gastritis then you can&rsquo;t do</p>
<p>that because it&rsquo;ll irritate it in which</p>
<p>case you need to start taking</p>
<p>chlorophyll to heal the tissue before</p>
<p>you acidify it</p>
<p>um also</p>
<p>um you know there could be also H pylori</p>
<p>going on as well that&rsquo;s one one issue</p>
<p>that you could have</p>
<p>um in which case um broccoli sprouts and</p>
<p>cabbage cabbage seems to be one of the</p>
<p>best</p>
<p>vegetables for that condition and you</p>
<p>might tolerate it very well and it&rsquo;s and</p>
<p>it works for various reasons which I&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>I talk about in my videos but that would</p>
<p>be something you can actually also do</p>
<p>but you need betaine hydrochloride big</p>
<p>time</p>
<p>all right very good let&rsquo;s go to quiz</p>
<p>question number three and there it is</p>
<p>okay what is the most effective</p>
<p>treatment</p>
<p>for a poor night&rsquo;s rest like you didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>sleep you slept like crap what&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>most effective treatment that you should</p>
<p>do at that point boy that&rsquo;s something we</p>
<p>could all use a bit of advice on it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>terrible when you wake up with a couple</p>
<p>hours of sleep and have to do something</p>
<p>constructive let&rsquo;s see</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>Marsha from Facebook you mentioned low</p>
<p>cortisol is as bad as high cortisol so</p>
<p>what is the solution to that issue I</p>
<p>guess</p>
<p>well it&rsquo;s hormone problems usually come</p>
<p>become a problem when the gland that</p>
<p>makes them has a problem and so when</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re dealing with adrenals we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>dealing with usually</p>
<p>the most common issue is this distress</p>
<p>the chronic stress that affects the</p>
<p>adrenals so you&rsquo;re going to have to</p>
<p>evaluate all the different aspects of</p>
<p>your life and just look at the stress is</p>
<p>it is there environmental stress for</p>
<p>people is it are you watching the news</p>
<p>24 7 like are you exercising are you</p>
<p>doing things to extract the stress</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a great new</p>
<p>um tool that I&rsquo;m going to introduce to</p>
<p>um in maybe hopefully a couple more</p>
<p>weeks because this is a device that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>relatively inexpensive and you can</p>
<p>measure and visualize your stress State</p>
<p>and your recovery and then you can have</p>
<p>a</p>
<p>some feedback mechanism to be able to</p>
<p>measure if what you&rsquo;re doing is working</p>
<p>to reduce your stress</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;ll be really good things but</p>
<p>again it&rsquo;s like with cortisol I mean</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s other rare causes some tumor and</p>
<p>things like that but usually it&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>to be chronic stress</p>
<p>if you have a loss of a loved one that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a really big one</p>
<p>um and uh that&rsquo;s something it&rsquo;s hard to</p>
<p>prevent</p>
<p>other than trying to keep everyone</p>
<p>healthy around you</p>
<p>um which is impossible but the point is</p>
<p>that um</p>
<p>the more losses that Stack Up The more</p>
<p>stress on the adrenals the more</p>
<p>susceptible you&rsquo;re already having a lot</p>
<p>of other health problems so you know you</p>
<p>just you want you have to</p>
<p>look long term and realize that the</p>
<p>older you get the worse these things get</p>
<p>and then you have to</p>
<p>establish some more of a health Reserve</p>
<p>so you have</p>
<p>your your as you get older you should be</p>
<p>more fit and that way you have this</p>
<p>health Reserve this buffer for for these</p>
<p>problems occur with life and then you</p>
<p>can deal with them much better so your</p>
<p>body doesn&rsquo;t fall apart</p>
<p>all right very good let&rsquo;s go to Ohio</p>
<p>with Arna he&rsquo;s been waiting patiently</p>
<p>and I want to make sure you&rsquo;re unmuted</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s going to demonstrate how to</p>
<p>knock out one question in 30 seconds go</p>
<p>ahead Arna you&rsquo;re on with Dr Byrd</p>
<p>um this is a follow-up question uh from</p>
<p>my previous question a couple weeks ago</p>
<p>I appreciate you being willing to to</p>
<p>hear me again so</p>
<p>um I wrote it down so I can get it out</p>
<p>in 30 seconds</p>
<p>okay so I&rsquo;m thinking about the possible</p>
<p>causes of liliana&rsquo;s</p>
<p>um night terrors and just not sure what</p>
<p>is going on we have been doing what you</p>
<p>suggested last time about the um</p>
<p>uh the four B ones just before bed</p>
<p>um so we have been doing that but she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>still having them it&rsquo;s not every night</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a couple times a week at least</p>
<p>um so my husband and I are wondering if</p>
<p>maybe you could shed some light on if</p>
<p>there might be an ingredient or</p>
<p>something that does this</p>
<p>um and if so if maybe uh it would</p>
<p>manifest itself in a night terror that</p>
<p>same night or a couple nights afterward</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re also thinking about maybe</p>
<p>um she&rsquo;s very gluten intolerant besides</p>
<p>her diabetes type one</p>
<p>so if she was exposed to gluten is that</p>
<p>something that causes night terrors we</p>
<p>try to be extremely careful with the</p>
<p>gluten but</p>
<p>um you know that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>her condition so</p>
<p>so I think the the best thing and you</p>
<p>probably already do this is to keep a</p>
<p>log of everything that she you know eats</p>
<p>and yes gluten could be one and also</p>
<p>another one I found is the erythritol</p>
<p>and other sugar alcohols can create a um</p>
<p>a really weird effect on someone&rsquo;s body</p>
<p>mood and even like you know night</p>
<p>terrors so I think that&rsquo;s smart to start</p>
<p>looking at different ingredients and uh</p>
<p>go go more uh go in that direction for</p>
<p>sure and also</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t remember if you told me if</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s anything else like did she</p>
<p>have any head injuries when she was a</p>
<p>baby</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad you asked that because</p>
<p>um there is a component to that</p>
<p>um she&rsquo;s never had a</p>
<p>well okay so the first time she had a</p>
<p>night terror was</p>
<p>um the night that I had an outpatient</p>
<p>procedure and they had to put me to</p>
<p>sleep and then I breastfed her that same</p>
<p>day I</p>
<p>um now I know that was probably the</p>
<p>worst thing I could have done</p>
<p>um because of whatever they used to put</p>
<p>me to sleep but she had a night terror</p>
<p>right after that and then</p>
<p>um it&rsquo;s been reoccurring ever since</p>
<p>um and then as far as head injuries to</p>
<p>herself she did fall really hard once on</p>
<p>her chin</p>
<p>and um</p>
<p>uh we put um you know butterfly bandages</p>
<p>on it and stuff uh there were no</p>
<p>stitches for that we tried to you know</p>
<p>take care of that but it was it was</p>
<p>pretty it was a pretty bad gash</p>
<p>um and then she also had a trump</p>
<p>traumatic injury when she felt she was</p>
<p>running and then fell into something in</p>
<p>her mouth and then they had we did have</p>
<p>to take her to the hospital for that one</p>
<p>um and she had stitches</p>
<p>um and they they put a local anesthesia</p>
<p>so she&rsquo;s had oh and then I I remembered</p>
<p>this cream that another time she was she</p>
<p>had a terrible night terror was after we</p>
<p>used this cream called lidocaine and</p>
<p>protocaine</p>
<p>prelocating okay so lidocaine and</p>
<p>prelocane is the name of it</p>
<p>um and so so that&rsquo;s a local anesthesia</p>
<p>topically</p>
<p>um for her her phobia of needles because</p>
<p>being type 1 diabetic she has so many</p>
<p>needles and</p>
<p>um so the doctor had uh told us to use</p>
<p>this stuff on her before she had um her</p>
<p>blood drawn</p>
<p>and that very night she had a terrible</p>
<p>night here so I you know of course we</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t use this every time it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s very</p>
<p>infrequent like whenever she has</p>
<p>something at the doctor we do it but</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>yeah</p>
<p>yeah and uh um there&rsquo;s a lot to be said</p>
<p>with this thing and maybe I&rsquo;ll talk to</p>
<p>you um later when we can have more time</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>um a couple things that come to mind is</p>
<p>that I may have have I might have this</p>
<p>data some words but if you search my</p>
<p>videos on how to get rid of old injuries</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>um the force that hits the chin can</p>
<p>travel to the TMJ which goes right to</p>
<p>the skull and that sometimes like when</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re sleeping have some of these head</p>
<p>traumas can kind of stir up stress in</p>
<p>the body</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>and so there&rsquo;s a technique to work on</p>
<p>extracting some of the stress especially</p>
<p>in the skull because there&rsquo;s sutures up</p>
<p>there and it can kind of I&rsquo;ve done that</p>
<p>with a lot of people and it&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>just help helped with their overall</p>
<p>stress in their body so they can get</p>
<p>into a much deeper sleep it seems to</p>
<p>work because if you think about it even</p>
<p>a child they do have they go through two</p>
<p>types of sleep one is a non-re-m</p>
<p>and uh the other was just REM they have</p>
<p>different Cycles the the sleet that</p>
<p>usually those nightmares are in the REM</p>
<p>sleep not the non-rem sleep</p>
<p>so um</p>
<p>that could be some type of uh thing that</p>
<p>you can work on too with the</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of like you&rsquo;re massaging some</p>
<p>of the sutures in her skull but then</p>
<p>also</p>
<p>um was there a certain place that she</p>
<p>hasn&rsquo;t got these injections or is it all</p>
<p>over the body</p>
<p>for with insulin</p>
<p>um so the insulin uh goes in through her</p>
<p>her pump and that is um yeah that&rsquo;s we</p>
<p>usually insert the little needle from</p>
<p>the pump into the thigh</p>
<p>um okay yeah for now</p>
<p>um and she doesn&rsquo;t like it on her tummy</p>
<p>so in the in the thigh and then she has</p>
<p>the CGM on her arm</p>
<p>um yeah</p>
<p>[Music]</p>
<p>something else that I think would be</p>
<p>really beneficial</p>
<p>um that metabolomic testing to just to</p>
<p>you know you could even do it as a</p>
<p>a dry blood spot and urine test and just</p>
<p>to look at all the chemistry see what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going on what&rsquo;s going on inside</p>
<p>cellular levels I think that would be a</p>
<p>very beneficial test if you could find</p>
<p>um even a home kit or something that you</p>
<p>can get</p>
<p>be a male</p>
<p>and I would actually love that I&rsquo;m sorry</p>
<p>what was that</p>
<p>yeah even</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>into</p>
<p>um get that test because they&rsquo;ll you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>be able to look right deep inside her</p>
<p>cells</p>
<p>um at the in the Krebs cycle and the</p>
<p>mitochondria and then also all these</p>
<p>different</p>
<p>these metabolites and uh wow get a much</p>
<p>deeper visual on what&rsquo;s going on if</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something that needs there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>some type of bottleneck or</p>
<p>stuck flow somewhere like oh this is</p>
<p>what she needs a lot of because there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some type of um</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something when we don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>enough data we want to do more get more</p>
<p>information and that&rsquo;s one of the best</p>
<p>most comprehensive tests that you can do</p>
<p>hey Arna I&rsquo;m sorry uh we would love to</p>
<p>hear back we&rsquo;re running out of time here</p>
<p>but please do keep us posted on that and</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t mind having you back again if</p>
<p>you discover some things that really</p>
<p>help your child that would be wonderful</p>
<p>can I just mention one more thing just</p>
<p>just so Dr Berg knows quickly we</p>
<p>actually have kept a food log</p>
<p>um like you suggested Dr Burke ever</p>
<p>since she became diabetic we kept a food</p>
<p>log very very um detailed of every</p>
<p>single thing she eats every day so and</p>
<p>how many carbs and all that so that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>that is done so did you correlate that</p>
<p>with the uh the nightmares</p>
<p>um that does not seem to have a</p>
<p>relationship that&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re so baffled</p>
<p>yeah okay well I&rsquo;ll tell you what what</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll do is we&rsquo;ll um I think you have my</p>
<p>email let&rsquo;s let&rsquo;s talk uh really soon</p>
<p>next week and see if we can sort that</p>
<p>out okay okay thank you that&rsquo;s great</p>
<p>thanks Arna for coming on and uh talking</p>
<p>about your uh beautiful child so we look</p>
<p>forward to hearing from you again and</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s go on an Arna I bet you had time</p>
<p>to look at the question and let&rsquo;s uh see</p>
<p>what the audience including Arna had to</p>
<p>say about that what&rsquo;s the most effective</p>
<p>treatment for a poor night&rsquo;s rest and 45</p>
<p>percent of the respondents say it&rsquo;s some</p>
<p>taking some magnesium or potassium 25</p>
<p>percent say hit the coffee uh 10 say</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s exercise or a brisk walk 10 say</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s naps and 10 say it&rsquo;s morning</p>
<p>sunlight</p>
<p>the best treatment the most effective is</p>
<p>taking a nap if you if your sleep is</p>
<p>crappy try to lay in you know in bed as</p>
<p>much as long as you can but just to nap</p>
<p>is going to be the best thing more than</p>
<p>coffee more than exercise because when</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t sleep you don&rsquo;t want to do any</p>
<p>high intensity exercise you want to do</p>
<p>long walks is fine hiking</p>
<p>um but um yeah magnesium is good for the</p>
<p>next night but a nap would be the best</p>
<p>way to recoup some of that lost sleep</p>
<p>wow congratulations you 10 percenters</p>
<p>you Smarties here&rsquo;s the next one a true</p>
<p>false or doc</p>
<p>okay true or false low salt in the diet</p>
<p>can Elevate one&rsquo;s blood sugars</p>
<p>all right jump on that folks</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s see Mela from Facebook I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>constantly getting mouth ulcers what is</p>
<p>causing this</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s usually a virus coming out of</p>
<p>remission which means that either you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going through too much stress and or</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re deficient in zinc</p>
<p>so take some zinc and also</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>you can take um the amino acid leucine</p>
<p>as well</p>
<p>L-lysine I&rsquo;m sorry L-lysine not leucine</p>
<p>um but not Arginine and that will also</p>
<p>help as well</p>
<p>all right very good let&rsquo;s see</p>
<p>um we got quiz for out</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>just a moment</p>
<p>ah Jerry from Facebook what are the best</p>
<p>remedies for chest pain from angina</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s true heart related you need</p>
<p>tocatrinals that&rsquo;s the type of vitamin E</p>
<p>um so usually they come in like 300</p>
<p>milligrams so I would take</p>
<p>times three the dosage maybe take one</p>
<p>three times a day and get off any type</p>
<p>of flower products or grain products and</p>
<p>sugar products</p>
<p>and and I&rsquo;ll call them junk food and</p>
<p>start really cleaning up the diet</p>
<p>um but you have to also realize that</p>
<p>sometimes angina can come from other</p>
<p>things too and I did a video on that you</p>
<p>can search that out</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>on Rumble because it probably you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>going to find it on YouTube but um</p>
<p>yeah so that&rsquo;s what I would do with</p>
<p>angina because that will increase the</p>
<p>oxygen to that muscle</p>
<p>and um</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll you&rsquo;ll be able to have less</p>
<p>cramping in the in the heart if it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>truly heart related</p>
<p>all right very good</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s see uh this one poor gentleman has</p>
<p>a Patrick excuse me from YouTube has</p>
<p>Type 2 diabetes and now has tingling in</p>
<p>his fingertips and his toes and wants to</p>
<p>know is there a way to reverse that</p>
<p>yeah</p>
<p>um you want to fix insulin resistance</p>
<p>and you want to get rid of the diabetes</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>and so to do that you want to lower the</p>
<p>carbs lower the reason why your sugar is</p>
<p>high in the first place lower the carbs</p>
<p>go into low carb like 20 grams or 10</p>
<p>grams of carbs per day</p>
<p>okay and also at the same time you can</p>
<p>take uh something like benphotamine</p>
<p>which is a fat soluble B1 vitamin which</p>
<p>will be great to help reverse peripheral</p>
<p>neuropathy</p>
<p>and a lot of times when you get that</p>
<p>product with benfotamine as a nerve</p>
<p>support formula it comes with alpha</p>
<p>lipoic acid which is the other antidote</p>
<p>for this peripheral neuropathy all right</p>
<p>our smart audience is already on and</p>
<p>completed quiz question number four</p>
<p>which is a true falser and asked or as</p>
<p>low salt in the diet can Elevate one&rsquo;s</p>
<p>blood sugar</p>
<p>and our astute audience 72 percent say</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s true 28 of our respondents say is</p>
<p>fall and according to my math that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>hundred percent of the respondents</p>
<p>yeah so yes it um it can increase the</p>
<p>blood glucose now what&rsquo;s interesting is</p>
<p>the way that you could have a low sodium</p>
<p>diet</p>
<p>um sweating too much and not replacing</p>
<p>those salts instead</p>
<p>you replace it with just water so here</p>
<p>you are working out and you&rsquo;re drinking</p>
<p>all this water to hydrate yourself</p>
<p>without the salt dangerous you can start</p>
<p>developing something called</p>
<p>hyponatremia which is uh where you have</p>
<p>this diluted salt and that can affect</p>
<p>your blood sugars but also causes you</p>
<p>know edema in your brain too so I think</p>
<p>um it&rsquo;s very dangerous to over hydrate</p>
<p>especially when you&rsquo;re exercising and in</p>
<p>heated weather without also taking salt</p>
<p>or electrolyte powder with a lot of salt</p>
<p>I have electrolyte powder with low salt</p>
<p>my regular one is with low salt and that</p>
<p>is not meant to take when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>sweating and exercising you&rsquo;d want to</p>
<p>take the sport hydration one just</p>
<p>with more salt but you could take mine</p>
<p>the regular one but just add more salt</p>
<p>to it sodium chloride so yeah it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>really important to have enough salt</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>and people don&rsquo;t realize that that can</p>
<p>create a blood sugar issue as well all</p>
<p>right very good I don&rsquo;t think we went to</p>
<p>Sahar have we in Canada Sahara are you</p>
<p>there</p>
<p>your little screen went dark and I can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>hear her Sahar</p>
<p>we we don&rsquo;t want to leave you hanging uh</p>
<p>anyway if you can hear me in the</p>
<p>background</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>you know doing something coming up and</p>
<p>scream at us before the end of the show</p>
<p>uh and let&rsquo;s see in the meantime</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>one more GA from Facebook my husband and</p>
<p>I are on zero carbs omad and my husband</p>
<p>has lost a lot of fat from around his</p>
<p>belly and all over but now the process</p>
<p>has slowed what can we do to boost the</p>
<p>fat burning process good for you guys</p>
<p>sometimes when you do it um over a</p>
<p>period of time you kind of hit this</p>
<p>Plateau</p>
<p>so I think what you can do to kind of</p>
<p>get it to work again is do some periodic</p>
<p>prolonged fasting do some</p>
<p>not very often but like maybe once a</p>
<p>week high intensity really good strong</p>
<p>workout</p>
<p>um and then also um</p>
<p>re-evaluate what you&rsquo;re eating to make</p>
<p>sure it&rsquo;s done correctly for example you</p>
<p>might be</p>
<p>doing keto that&rsquo;s not the highest</p>
<p>quality</p>
<p>another thing you might notice is that</p>
<p>your stress level went up I would</p>
<p>evaluate that and so you can do</p>
<p>something about that as well but I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>just these are just hypothetical things</p>
<p>that I would look at</p>
<p>all right very good final question of</p>
<p>the day here it is</p>
<p>um can you hear me now Sahar yeah let me</p>
<p>listen let me bring down this question</p>
<p>and uh let&rsquo;s go ahead with Sahara I</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t see it but go ahead with your</p>
<p>question Sahar</p>
<p>okay thank you</p>
<p>um I&rsquo;m really happy to be in the show</p>
<p>today thanks uh sir for having me my</p>
<p>question is regarding my daughter she is</p>
<p>seven years old and she&rsquo;s been diagnosed</p>
<p>to have psoriasis black psoriasis</p>
<p>um a couple of months ago</p>
<p>um and the doctor advised to have</p>
<p>Stelara</p>
<p>um injections I am a bit like they said</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s it has to be like</p>
<p>um forever like she has to be on it for</p>
<p>her life and I&rsquo;m a bit uh concerned</p>
<p>about this I&rsquo;m not sure if should I go</p>
<p>with this option or should I go with the</p>
<p>naturopath kind of thing uh second thing</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been watching all the videos uh for</p>
<p>you about psoriasis and I was wondering</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re all advices are they proper to</p>
<p>be for a seven years old like um the</p>
<p>same advice you&rsquo;ve provided</p>
<p>Okay so</p>
<p>psoriasis is an autoimmune situation I</p>
<p>have a lot of videos and of course you&rsquo;d</p>
<p>have to adjust the recommendations for a</p>
<p>child so one recommendation is that the</p>
<p>vitamin D so you probably just want to</p>
<p>do a smaller amounts of vitamin D but</p>
<p>that would be really important the other</p>
<p>thing is that there&rsquo;s a great natural</p>
<p>things out there that use light therapy</p>
<p>a certain type of light to treat this</p>
<p>psoriasis</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>you know I can&rsquo;t tell you not to take a</p>
<p>certain medication but I will make you</p>
<p>aware of the other options out there</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s also</p>
<p>might be good to do some type of DNA</p>
<p>testing on her to see if there is</p>
<p>anything that uh</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going on going against her</p>
<p>genetic wise which would kind of put her</p>
<p>at a predisposed level like and it&rsquo;d be</p>
<p>interesting to see the vitamin D</p>
<p>receptor and so then that way she can</p>
<p>take even more</p>
<p>than um</p>
<p>maybe what they recommend because she</p>
<p>has certain genetic weaknesses that are</p>
<p>preventing the absorption and I see that</p>
<p>very very often a lot of people with</p>
<p>vitamin D</p>
<p>um but yeah that&rsquo;s what I would do and</p>
<p>um and then see how it works and then we</p>
<p>just keep looking at it over and over</p>
<p>until</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>we we figure it out but um that would be</p>
<p>at least the starting point</p>
<p>all right thank you doctor</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re welcome thank you so much so hard</p>
<p>for your brief uh comment we wish uh</p>
<p>wish you all all the best with that uh</p>
<p>now let&rsquo;s see here</p>
<p>oh here&rsquo;s Apple I bet there&rsquo;s a billion</p>
<p>people around the world including my son</p>
<p>that would like to know uh what you have</p>
<p>to say RDG from YouTube what&rsquo;s the best</p>
<p>way to get off energy drinks I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>drinking between 300 and 500 milligrams</p>
<p>of caffeine a day because of these</p>
<p>drinks boy he&rsquo;s just shaking it up</p>
<p>yeah they&rsquo;re popular aren&rsquo;t they you I I</p>
<p>went to</p>
<p>uh the gas station the other day and I</p>
<p>just saw this huge line of the Five Hour</p>
<p>Energy drinks and the different stimulus</p>
<p>type things that people are obviously</p>
<p>tired and they&rsquo;re trying to wake up I</p>
<p>think they are dangerous</p>
<p>um especially if you&rsquo;re a child because</p>
<p>the amount of caffeine in there and also</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re using synthetic vitamins</p>
<p>um like the B12 they&rsquo;re using</p>
<p>cyanocobolamine and they&rsquo;re using folic</p>
<p>acid they&rsquo;re not using the folate the</p>
<p>methyl versions and if you start adding</p>
<p>those up with other things</p>
<p>you can have you can create uh some</p>
<p>problems</p>
<p>which I&rsquo;m not going to get into at this</p>
<p>point but you can watch my video on that</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>um you have sugar in some of these</p>
<p>drinks you have the caffeine and you</p>
<p>have the synthetic vitamins in very high</p>
<p>levels can&rsquo;t be good so yeah there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s problems with that</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re trying to get energy</p>
<p>get it from health healthy things like</p>
<p>sleeping and exercise and eating the</p>
<p>right Foods</p>
<p>all right very good and Dr Bart why</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t we talk a little bit about</p>
<p>um Rumble you know and is there any</p>
<p>particular way for them to navigate</p>
<p>should they go to the website and is</p>
<p>there a link there what&rsquo;s going on with</p>
<p>that</p>
<p>the nice thing about Rumble is they they</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t restrict</p>
<p>um of what I talk about and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s that way you can go there and get</p>
<p>a complete knowledge the other thing is</p>
<p>that if you sign up or subscribe to me</p>
<p>you will get me in your feed versus</p>
<p>YouTube</p>
<p>you know they only give a very tiny</p>
<p>percentage of my subscribers uh</p>
<p>notification that there&rsquo;s a video</p>
<p>released</p>
<p>so I think um</p>
<p>I think Rumble is a valid place to go to</p>
<p>to search things it doesn&rsquo;t obviously</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t have all the features that</p>
<p>YouTube has but they&rsquo;ll have all the</p>
<p>videos so definitely you want to at the</p>
<p>very least subscribe so that way if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re trying to find some information</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t find it go to rumble and it&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>be right there for you so</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s um that&rsquo;s gonna be cool</p>
<p>I am still ovulating all the results of</p>
<p>your wonderful</p>
<p>feedback on the survey that you did um I</p>
<p>mean you have to realize there&rsquo;s fifty</p>
<p>thousand uh people fill that thing out</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s taking us uh quite some time</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m getting incredible feedback on</p>
<p>what people think about that whole thing</p>
<p>because this recent change with YouTube</p>
<p>is like</p>
<p>um you know it&rsquo;s just like if you talk</p>
<p>they leave it a bit vague like if you</p>
<p>talk about</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>uh anything that conflicts with the</p>
<p>World Health Organization or even in the</p>
<p>area of prevention they they make they</p>
<p>may remove the video so it&rsquo;s just like</p>
<p>so arbitrary and unfortunately</p>
<p>the the real reason people go to YouTube</p>
<p>uh in the area of searching for health</p>
<p>is to find natural non-toxic ways to</p>
<p>deal with issues and so they don&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>more medical uh information they want</p>
<p>other information not to say that</p>
<p>medicine doesn&rsquo;t work at all I&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>saying that it should be an open forum</p>
<p>for discussion uh to give diverse</p>
<p>viewpoints on health and uh and people</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t like that they&rsquo;re changing this</p>
<p>apparently this change that YouTube is</p>
<p>making is a pilot it&rsquo;s an experiment I</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s going to utterly fail because</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not what people want and when you</p>
<p>use this authoritative you know one</p>
<p>Viewpoint people are not going to go for</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re very intelligent they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>very aware and it&rsquo;s not what they call</p>
<p>Health illiteracy</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s not that people aren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>smart enough to identify things they are</p>
<p>smart enough to identify but they use</p>
<p>that word as the reason uh for people</p>
<p>not able to choose or discern between</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s true and what&rsquo;s false so anyway</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s a crazy thing and um</p>
<p>um unfortunately they&rsquo;re restricting</p>
<p>more and more of the voice and so this</p>
<p>is why we have to be on multiple</p>
<p>platforms and not put all our eggs in</p>
<p>that one YouTube basket</p>
<p>yeah and you know</p>
<p>um with the same respect for medical</p>
<p>science but they change all the time</p>
<p>they discover you know this is excellent</p>
<p>for you got to go to this oops we were</p>
<p>wrong people die if you do that so you</p>
<p>know you I mean nothing&rsquo;s perfect so we</p>
<p>need to be able to choose you know we</p>
<p>all get One Life to Live here on Earth</p>
<p>and we should have the right to choose</p>
<p>and disseminate or be disseminated</p>
<p>information for a lot of people so you</p>
<p>know when the doctors will be the first</p>
<p>ones to tell you we thought that was</p>
<p>true but now it ain&rsquo;t if you keep doing</p>
<p>it that&rsquo;ll probably kill you is that</p>
<p>disinformation I mean you know well well</p>
<p>especially when you get in the area of</p>
<p>nutrition in food and diet right so</p>
<p>first of all there&rsquo;s really no consensus</p>
<p>I mean you can&rsquo;t put everyone on the</p>
<p>same diet I mean what works for one</p>
<p>person will not work for someone else</p>
<p>and so when you get it when you start</p>
<p>getting authoritarian viewpoints with</p>
<p>diet</p>
<p>um especially when you have a dietitian</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s funded by all sorts of conflicts</p>
<p>of interest which is known it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>anything crazy like you&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>start using that like people can see</p>
<p>right through that it&rsquo;s not a good move</p>
<p>they should allow more um less algorithm</p>
<p>filtering</p>
<p>um I mean it&rsquo;s just a joke but anyway</p>
<p>on that thought thank you for your</p>
<p>wonderful attention we will see you uh</p>
<p>on Rumble very soon and have a wonderful</p>
<p>weekend</p>
<p>thank you</p>
