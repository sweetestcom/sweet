<p>Call him daddy.</p>
<p>Do I call her daddy?</p>
<p>Call her daddy.</p>
<p>Merry Christmas, bitches.</p>
<p>Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.</p>
<p>0:19</p>
<p>Oh, it&rsquo;s New Year is.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Okay, great.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s gonna confuse the fuck out of people that like, wait.</p>
<p>What am I listening to its call her Daddy, get it again.</p>
<p>Well, well, well, well, well, I&rsquo;ll be Eeny, Cabo.</p>
<p>Cabochon do Cabo.</p>
<p>San, Lucas went cold on you guys.</p>
<p>0:35</p>
<p>Maybe.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you fall from the gram.</p>
<p>Maybe you saw some of our bikini pictures.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, tits out ass out for the Graham.</p>
<p>You have to gotta respect it.</p>
<p>You have to do it.</p>
<p>The third strap is all you can rely on in this life that we live.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>So guys.</p>
<p>We went to Cabo, which I think a lot of people don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>0:52</p>
<p>We went to Cabo for work.</p>
<p>We weren&rsquo;t just like going, no, raging party, you ever work.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just get into it.</p>
<p>Just tell them, Kylie Jenner&rsquo;s, bodyguard.</p>
<p>We had Kylie Jenner&rsquo;s, bodyguard.</p>
<p>He is a 10 out of 10 out of 10, smoke show, fucking so hot.</p>
<p>1:08</p>
<p>We tried to seduce him on numerous occasions.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not a joke.</p>
<p>I would have thought, literally, answer the door topless and be like hi, Hi, how are you amount of times?</p>
<p>I Alex would be like, oh my gosh.</p>
<p>Like, I just, can you just tell me like, if my tits fall out of my nipple, pokes out, and he&rsquo;s like, my nipples are completely out of sight.</p>
<p>1:29</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see anything.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like I&rsquo;m actually here trying to like I&rsquo;m here for your safety.</p>
<p>But I sure like, please hit watch my did second.</p>
<p>So obviously I don&rsquo;t know if you guys know but it&rsquo;s the one that like they thought that he was stormy&rsquo;s, Dad or whatever, right?</p>
<p>So that just got our dicks hard.</p>
<p>1:44</p>
<p>Like we were so into it.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t look at any other man because I was so into town.</p>
<p>I mean and he did not give us the domain.</p>
<p>He was extremely professional fun.</p>
<p>He wasn&rsquo;t into it kind of sucks.</p>
<p>So we went on Bolta.</p>
<p>It really did.</p>
<p>So I mean there&rsquo;s a lot of nipples on this trip.</p>
<p>There.</p>
<p>2:01</p>
<p>I mean I&rsquo;ve gone to Vegas, we&rsquo;ve all done it the day clubs and nightclubs.</p>
<p>It gets wild.</p>
<p>This particular Club situation there.</p>
<p>At one point.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re like three girls with areola showing just popping out and they&rsquo;re all on top of each other.</p>
<p>2:18</p>
<p>It was like a threesome grind evening now.</p>
<p>And then, there is like the typical and, like, pop up in her nipples would have been labia poking out.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t ya, couple flaps, hanging out.</p>
<p>The bikini, it was a good look.</p>
<p>We only went for two days.</p>
<p>Yeah, kind of sucks Patriot.</p>
<p>2:33</p>
<p>It did suck.</p>
<p>And then we were working both of the days.</p>
<p>Usually I think Alex night.</p>
<p>I mean we were ratchet.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s hammered ratchet disgusting.</p>
<p>Yeah, but usually we would have even multiplied though.</p>
<p>We will we will.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna do an upcoming trip for sure to a trip just for call her daddy and like, give you guys feedback.</p>
<p>2:50</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So the men in Cabo, you know, there were some it, we grinded a little, but by the time we got home, there were none.</p>
<p>It was like a choice that we made and then we kind of regret it were like, why don&rsquo;t we just bring those guys back to her place?</p>
<p>But you know what we saved ourselves.</p>
<p>3:06</p>
<p>What do we do?</p>
<p>Sofia?</p>
<p>Well, we reached out to home base.</p>
<p>We called the men in New York.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s from Mexico.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what we did.</p>
<p>Their God.</p>
<p>They must have felt spotted international calling card.</p>
<p>I did so and mind you we stayed in a suite where there were multiple places for me to sleep alone and for Alex to sleep alone.</p>
<p>3:29</p>
<p>Own but in call her daddy fashion who we picked the bed to sleep together, right next to each other.</p>
<p>We had to cool.</p>
<p>So 3 a.m.</p>
<p>Rolls around, it&rsquo;s 3 a.m.</p>
<p>And I decide to call my honey bunny know something you call.</p>
<p>3:47</p>
<p>The guys are fucking in New York, and I called my guy York and I call him and things turned sexual and that should have been the cue for me to stand up and go to another room.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But Alex and I are so incestual that it didn&rsquo;t even occur to me.</p>
<p>4:05</p>
<p>I was drunk.</p>
<p>I was lazy.</p>
<p>And I was like, you know what, I&rsquo;m going to do it right next to Alitalia.</p>
<p>And so naturally, what do I do?</p>
<p>I fucking pick up the phone and I call my guy, so Sofia and I just cut to the chase.</p>
<p>Um, we had a bunch of goddamn hours.</p>
<p>4:21</p>
<p>I got no fucking no Sophia and I had phone sex.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>And it wasn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Like Alex and I were like rubbing up on each other.</p>
<p>Maybe we were a little bit towards the end.</p>
<p>We were a little bit I might think I&rsquo;m pretty sure we fucking old at the same time style.</p>
<p>4:39</p>
<p>You were tempting idea.</p>
<p>Yeah, and the thing that I think was truly a blessing is we&rsquo;re I think we don&rsquo;t give ourselves enough credit.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re really generous.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It was guys.</p>
<p>Wet dream legit, like if a guy was like, okay, you either gonna have Alex or Sophia or you going to have both of them?</p>
<p>4:58</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m innocent.</p>
<p>A 10 out of 10 times are going to be like, let&rsquo;s go.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So basically, we had our first for some together virtually identical.</p>
<p>I definitely think like we could have taken it to separate bedrooms, but I don&rsquo;t regret it.</p>
<p>5:13</p>
<p>I mean why though, you know, it&rsquo;s for research purposes mom, if you&rsquo;re listening there is no need.</p>
<p>There was no need but again for Carlos enough.</p>
<p>At this point.</p>
<p>I think it got us closer.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I could hear what you were selling.</p>
<p>Those guys aren&rsquo;t so fucked up.</p>
<p>5:29</p>
<p>And Love Fest, but the great thing is, you could say something.</p>
<p>I would just repeat what you said and then you can when I was like, blanking on the like, yeah.</p>
<p>Oh my baby.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s do it again.</p>
<p>Work Teamwork Makes the Dream Work baby.</p>
<p>Oh, fuck me.</p>
<p>Hi, Mom.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So yeah.</p>
<p>Cobo was fun.</p>
<p>5:44</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s coming home to our apartment.</p>
<p>Okay?</p>
<p>Okay, we&rsquo;ve talked about our apartment.</p>
<p>We talk, right?</p>

<p>Okay?</p>
<p>When I explained it to them Sofia, so I&rsquo;ll Honey, we&rsquo;re getting back from a trip.</p>
<p>6:00</p>
<p>Yeah, so the news is on, on the plane, and there&rsquo;s a story and it says, Lower East Side, New York and Alexander like, oh, we live there.</p>
<p>And we look a little bit closer and they mentioned the coordinates and lo and behold our apartment complex is literally right there on that very corner, and they say that there is a man with a sword, slashing people&rsquo;s faces and we&rsquo;re like, oh, New York City straight to the slasher.</p>
<p>6:36</p>
<p>So now we not only do we live in a bug infested shit invested, but there&rsquo;s a crazy man Sofia and I&rsquo;ve been walking around and every time we come close to a man, we kind of just like dip and move and twirl and correlate just like a weird situation.</p>
<p>6:54</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like we are just really trying to fight for our lives at this very moment.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t we&rsquo;re really just Take one day at a time.</p>
<p>Our apartment is something that I would never in a million years.</p>
<p>Let someone see fun night.</p>
<p>7:10</p>
<p>I have dated guys that are like, can I like?</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ll know my parents before you see my apartment and nothing a fucking lawn.</p>
<p>Yeah guys, it&rsquo;s just it just again, we don&rsquo;t have to tell you that.</p>
<p>7:26</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s get into it.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s get into it.</p>
<p>So in every relationship, you know, you take that step of the first date, the First Dates can be awkward or they can be amazing.</p>
<p>But today guys, daddy being we are here to bring you.</p>
<p>Mmm.</p>
<p>7:42</p>
<p>First Dates, we want to talk about them, like we say on color daddy, you know, we get right to anal.</p>
<p>We gets above five honey, but there is this thing and it is called dating and I do this thing and it is called a first date.</p>
<p>Oh my God, so so let&rsquo;s talk.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go.</p>
<p>So, Sofia.</p>
<p>What is the one thing that if a guy was?</p>
<p>7:59</p>
<p>To want to take you on a first date.</p>
<p>What could he ask you that?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d like?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m actually not going.</p>
<p>Never mind.</p>
<p>Okay, if he said, what do you want to do?</p>
<p>Oh, block to get the fuck out of my body off.</p>
<p>Blocked.</p>
<p>Why get out of my face guys, everybody listening.</p>
<p>8:14</p>
<p>You have to understand when you see all the memes on Instagram of how indecisive girls are, you know, not a fucking job.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m eating for dinner.</p>
<p>Do not know that here and think that I&rsquo;m going to plan this fucking date.</p>
<p>The second guy is like, what do you want to do?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, not you.</p>
<p>Not you, and I&rsquo;m not coming and I woke on that date.</p>
<p>8:31</p>
<p>So guys make sure you don&rsquo;t ask her what she wants to do.</p>
<p>Now.</p>
<p>I do think that there is so guys are like, okay, so I just fucking pick a place.</p>
<p>I do think it is appropriate to say.</p>
<p>Do you have any preferences?</p>
<p>If not, I can plan the night for us.</p>
<p>You have to follow it up with.</p>
<p>If not, I got a couple.</p>
<p>8:47</p>
<p>Yeah, do you have any preferences and she&rsquo;s like no.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>My bed Netflix and not right.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the first the first device for giving you is.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t fucking ask her where she wants to go.</p>
<p>Second thing.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t ask her.</p>
<p>What type of food?</p>
<p>She likes.</p>
<p>Jesus, just mother, golly.</p>
<p>9:03</p>
<p>Why did you want me to like, write a list?</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Like my food allergies.</p>
<p>Is that what yours it?</p>
<p>Is?</p>
<p>It that hard know that art guys, just unless you&rsquo;re taking her to like, go, get fucking Ethiopian food or something.</p>
<p>Oh, take her to american-italian.</p>
<p>Even take her to go get sushi, and if she needs to, she can order the fucking chicken teriyaki, like, little uncultured slashes.</p>
<p>9:26</p>
<p>My God.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s true though, really don&rsquo;t ask you were like, oh no, what&rsquo;s your, what food in and out up.</p>
<p>And usually people eat everything and bring her to a place with a big ass menu and choose that one of the fuck&rsquo;s you want.</p>
<p>Okay, Alex.</p>
<p>What about getting to the date?</p>
<p>Okay, the driving suggestion.</p>
<p>9:42</p>
<p>This is how I feel.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re on the same page as me.</p>
<p>Let me know.</p>
<p>Okay, in at least in New York City, right?</p>
<p>I fucking hate for at least the first date.</p>
<p>If he offers this actually bouncing fucked up, but just bear with me.</p>
<p>I hate when he offers to pick me up in Uber and go with me to the place.</p>
<p>10:01</p>
<p>Now, let me explain why.</p>
<p>Okay, I hate it.</p>
<p>Because when you get into an Uber on the first date, you know how that you have, that awkward, small talk that you&rsquo;ve tried to make before you get to the real talk at dinner.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s like, you&rsquo;re just kind of sitting there waiting to get to the destination White Noise.</p>
<p>10:19</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just trying to sell like the weather today, like, get in the back of the Uber and be like, alright, so, back in the day, when my heart broken.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, hold on.</p>
<p>Yeah, you make stupid conversation.</p>
<p>So my My go-to I think is I think every guy should offer to get her an Uber to the place and I older guys listening.</p>
<p>10:37</p>
<p>I know there are guys on here being like why the fuck did the guys have to do that?</p>
<p>Just be a man.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just what it is what it is.</p>
<p>A so many people are like up in arms because it&rsquo;s like equality in 2019, whatever.</p>
<p>Ya know men.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, get her a fuckin Uber.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how I don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Maybe there&rsquo;s girls who think differently but I want you to pay for dinner and I want you to get me the car.</p>
<p>10:56</p>
<p>I agree.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t you?</p>
<p>Kind of think it&rsquo;s like hot when they offer you an Uber.</p>
<p>So Like all my when he&rsquo;s like, let me know when you&rsquo;re ready and I&rsquo;ll call you whenever I&rsquo;m like I just came.</p>
<p>I even you don&rsquo;t even have a text night.</p>
<p>I literally just came.</p>
<p>So guys, take I think the whole part is take charge.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s so hot.</p>
<p>Take charge.</p>
<p>11:11</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what it is.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when it&rsquo;s really, really hot.</p>
<p>So offer her an Uber.</p>
<p>Yes, and wait, let me just also say, for all the people listening in college or in high school.</p>
<p>I get it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little bit different in college.</p>
<p>So if I was in college, yeah, if you have a car, you pick her up and write go, which I get but when you get a little older if you&rsquo;re in the The city expects her to just meet each other.</p>
<p>11:30</p>
<p>That you said something very interesting.</p>
<p>You were like, it looks so hot when guys dry do and I was like, what are you talking about?</p>
<p>Everybody?</p>
<p>Listen, I&rsquo;m like, I told Sofia this the other day and she looked at me like I was a psycho and I feel like it&rsquo;s such a thing.</p>
<p>I feel like when I see a guy driving, I feel like he&rsquo;s so sweet.</p>
<p>11:47</p>
<p>Like when you&rsquo;re sitting next to a man, driving on the highway, I&rsquo;m like hotness.</p>
<p>Okay, so pretty much you just drive around because everyone&rsquo;s I mean, when you&rsquo;re in the car with him, okay, like I remember the first time that my boyfriend in high school picked me up.</p>
<p>12:08</p>
<p>He looked so hydrating Hard Road.</p>
<p>No, but then I found out he was like, driving really slow and I was like, why are you driving so slow?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, I have a DUI.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have my license, but I pick the good ones clapping.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t think Isaac hot when they&rsquo;re driving.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;ve never really thought about it.</p>
<p>But Daddy gang DME, I&rsquo;ll check out my Uber driver when we&rsquo;re leaving here.</p>
<p>12:25</p>
<p>Okay, so I just want to say something about where to go.</p>
<p>Go.</p>
<p>I always think dinners great.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>You mentioned like a comedy club.</p>
<p>Oh, I had a guy take me to a comedy club and we got like appetizers and drinks before and then I like serve drinks at comedy clubs and you can still talk during them.</p>
<p>12:42</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like a fucking movie.</p>
<p>Okay, that&rsquo;s what I was going to say.</p>
<p>If you are taking someone to a movie, die die, die, roll over.</p>
<p>And just I I mean if you&rsquo;re in middle school because that&rsquo;s what I used to do is in middle school.</p>
<p>12:57</p>
<p>I would do that if you&rsquo;re Teen, go for it.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re older than the age of 13 and you&rsquo;re trying to do that, then you&rsquo;re legit.</p>
<p>Okay, so just I&rsquo;m hope I hope we&rsquo;re all on the same page that again.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not inviting girls to the fucking movies.</p>
<p>Okay, that&rsquo;s what you do.</p>
<p>13:13</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re like an older couple and you&rsquo;re like, okay.</p>
<p>What do you wanna do?</p>
<p>Now?</p>
<p>Another thing for First Dates?</p>
<p>I wanted to bring up.</p>
<p>Okay, don&rsquo;t go in there with like a list of questions.</p>
<p>Jesus Christ, like, you know when you go there and it&rsquo;s like you can dance, it&rsquo;s like they are first date veterans, like do a first day, every single All day and they&rsquo;re like, hi.</p>
<p>13:30</p>
<p>So um, are you new to this whole thing?</p>
<p>Like, like, how many, you know, I didn&rsquo;t know you just cringed up.</p>
<p>I wish you guys could see Sophia, right now.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a question that people ask and I&rsquo;ve had to answer it.</p>
<p>Thousands of times.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna freak out.</p>
<p>13:46</p>
<p>What are your hobbies?</p>
<p>Oh my god, when someone asks me what my hobbies are.</p>
<p>I want to tell them to suck my dick out of here.</p>
<p>Sucking dick is my home.</p>
<p>Fuck out of my face.</p>
<p>I like Twirl on that dick and go up and down.</p>
<p>What do you do for a living?</p>
<p>14:02</p>
<p>Shut the fuck up.</p>
<p>As can&rsquo;t do dad, that is one of the, okay.</p>
<p>What do you want to sign it?</p>
<p>And I eat, I really, really hate that.</p>
<p>Yeah, guys.</p>
<p>I think you have to just try to be organic with it and don&rsquo;t have a question after question, after question this.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about you.</p>
<p>14:18</p>
<p>I want to give guys this.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about, you get to dinner.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Ordering.</p>
<p>This is a big fucking thing for me.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s appropriate.</p>
<p>Yet for a guy, to take about 80% charge on a date.</p>
<p>Okay, I think it&rsquo;s really hot.</p>
<p>14:33</p>
<p>And manly.</p>
<p>I do not like when a guy says I&rsquo;ll order for, you know, however, I think it is so hot.</p>
<p>Yeah, if you first of all, guys, you should bring her some where you&rsquo;ve been before.</p>
<p>So, you know, the atmosphere and, you know, and then expand, then you can say, like, you know, I know like, what&rsquo;s good here.</p>
<p>14:51</p>
<p>Yes, so you guys can basically be like, hey, I have we should definitely get these.</p>
<p>These, these appetizers and then let me know order.</p>
<p>Ever you want.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think it&rsquo;s so hot when a guy says order, whatever you want, but then also takes charge and cherchez.</p>
<p>I think it makes it so much more fun.</p>
<p>15:08</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something like kind of awkward when the guys, like I&rsquo;ll have the steak in the girls.</p>
<p>Like, I&rsquo;ll get this salad.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s just more fun when he&rsquo;s like, share.</p>
<p>And I know it&rsquo;s stupid, but like it&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>When you like, oh, like that was so good.</p>
<p>Like, tasty.</p>
<p>I think cetera.</p>
<p>It just makes it more inclusive as a post like, sitting across the table likes.</p>
<p>15:24</p>
<p>Fucking stick figures.</p>
<p>I mean, okay.</p>
<p>For conversation people like always.</p>
<p>Freaked out about like what to talk about?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think what&rsquo;s your go to talk about but style?</p>
<p>First time I actually asked really an approach I do too but I think it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s which I have just blacked out.</p>
<p>15:46</p>
<p>I suffer from Rage blackouts re1 right?</p>
<p>I think keep it light-hearted.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about that because there is this thing and I think sometimes people get nervous and like they Like super serious shit, dude, like don&rsquo;t hit him with like the, you know, I was like abandoned by my father and I was 7, and my mom, Danielle and my dad&rsquo;s in jail and, you know, right, right, right.</p>
<p>16:10</p>
<p>Keep that for like, maybe on the third day.</p>
<p>I got first date.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think also talking about past relationships is never a go to, yes, because, don&rsquo;t you feel only if a guy and his girlfriend?</p>
<p>If a guy mentions his girlfriend, next warrants ex-girlfriend more than one time, I like, he&rsquo;s still in love with 100%.</p>
<p>16:29</p>
<p>Thousand per.</p>
<p>So guys.</p>
<p>I think it works both ways.</p>
<p>Like if I agree marking about her and you know what, I think a lot of times even if you aren&rsquo;t in love with that person, still what happens is when you get nervous on a first date, your natural go to is like even if you&rsquo;re going to shit on your ex or something, but it comes off, like, you&rsquo;re still in love.</p>
<p>16:45</p>
<p>I also want to bring up the people that talk about themselves and how the monologue on the first fucking date.</p>
<p>I the oyster guy out, you know.</p>
<p>It.</p>
<p>Well, I already know the guy that I got oysters way.</p>
<p>17:02</p>
<p>Hmm, I swear to fucking God, he ended up talking to me about his buck and recital in fourth grade before he even out of you had a family and he&rsquo;s like all the way back in middle school.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s gone through college.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s cool.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s back and forth.</p>
<p>17:18</p>
<p>So my last name&rsquo;s Franklin, if you wanted to know you fucking asshole.</p>
<p>You wanted to know like go suck your own dick.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>No, no neither.</p>
<p>Yeah, guys, I think Make sure even again guys if you&rsquo;re just there to fuck act, like you give a shit about your life.</p>
<p>17:33</p>
<p>We always say.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I actually I said keep it light-hearted.</p>
<p>I think you kind of should but I mean like especially when you&rsquo;re older like you do kind of get into more serious conversation.</p>
<p>Just don&rsquo;t hit him with like the big.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>III a heavy.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t have word vomit.</p>
<p>17:49</p>
<p>And then last but not least, when you are finishing the date.</p>
<p>The guy you need to pick up the bill.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You should not even know.</p>
<p>It should not even be a question.</p>
<p>The girl shouldn&rsquo;t feel awkward.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just the way it.</p>
<p>If it guy went Dutch with me.</p>
<p>18:05</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve like, oh my God.</p>
<p>People.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never had it happen.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s just like an urban legend.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a myth, but I heard it does.</p>
<p>Oh my God.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Oh, I have heard of some of my friends and they&rsquo;re like, yeah, let&rsquo;s you want to split it and you&rsquo;re like what in the fuck I would actually you will never eat my pussy.</p>
<p>Like no, you know what?</p>
<p>18:21</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to pick up the bill.</p>
<p>Yep, and you can go masturbate into your sock and I was like the little bitch boy that she was It&rsquo;s so true you guys pick up the movie sound like angry, right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, man.</p>
<p>No, this is because we fucking love you and we want you to do the best first day.</p>
<p>18:39</p>
<p>I got the bill.</p>
<p>Yes, open the door for her.</p>
<p>Sugary is not fucking dead.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s so hot when you like puts his arm on the back of your back.</p>
<p>When he opens the door.</p>
<p>He leads you in.</p>
<p>He has appetizers ready to go.</p>
<p>Yeah, just take charge.</p>
<p>Yeah, but don&rsquo;t be an asshole and obviously offer her whatever she want.</p>
<p>Okay, boom.</p>

<p>They like it Men.</p>
<p>22:50</p>
<p>We is it.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s the guy that also.</p>
<p>He was dating a really hot girl from Vegas guy.</p>

<p>They&rsquo;re telling me to fuck his friends are telling me to fuck the president.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like bitch, but he it&rsquo;s a great sex.</p>
<p>Best sex ever.</p>
<p>You know what?</p>
<p>This actually brought up a really random point.</p>
<p>23:22</p>
<p>I mean like here I am getting a date with a guy and he was very vocal about his sexual past.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like I have fucked a lot of women.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, oh, okay.</p>
<p>Okay, this is cool.</p>
<p>And he ended up telling me that I said, who of all the girls, you fucked fucked, every nationalities that every skin color doesn&rsquo;t discriminate novel.</p>
<p>23:43</p>
<p>Terminate pussy is pussy.</p>
<p>And so, he told me, he said, I will tell you right now.</p>
<p>The best girls in bed are Jewish girls.</p>
<p>I know, right?</p>
<p>What I know.</p>
<p>I said the same thing.</p>
<p>I was like, wait, what?</p>
<p>23:58</p>
<p>No, I don&rsquo;t have anything against Jewish gonna know.</p>
<p>I was just kidding.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t get it.</p>
<p>So he told me that Jewish girls.</p>
<p>Okay, know how to make themselves come and they know what they want in the bedroom.</p>
<p>So he said when and also, he said they Usually come off very unassuming in there like kind of innocent.</p>
<p>24:17</p>
<p>And he said, when I get a Jewish girl in the bedroom, she is like, put it here.</p>
<p>Put this there, fuck me like this and she gets herself off in it and she knows, oh of calm, like, he was like, she&rsquo;s never gonna leave their.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Faking an orgasm.</p>
<p>She every Jewish girl.</p>
<p>Willow.</p>
<p>24:33</p>
<p>I am dying right now, like what am I?</p>
<p>First of all?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s insane.</p>
<p>Like I never knew that.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know that either.</p>
<p>I like want you do.</p>
<p>Dana literally goes through likes to be honest.</p>
<p>He clearly has another podcast.</p>
<p>He was like, um, like for someone, like you like, when I see a blond American, girl, that&rsquo;s like decently good looking.</p>
<p>24:50</p>
<p>I would think that you&rsquo;re going to be all talking.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to suck in bed.</p>
<p>And I was like this thing called the backlight 9,000.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s that is so interesting, but that just goes to show that like men if you go in there with girls.</p>
<p>25:06</p>
<p>Listen, if you go in there and you&rsquo;re selfish and you&rsquo;re like, I need to get in here and get off.</p>
<p>Yes, men.</p>
<p>That is the Biggest turn-on though.</p>
<p>That is what it is.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s this thing where girls think in their mind like like I got on that job, guys can see through the fuck can see through it most of the time.</p>
<p>25:25</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s like if you go in there fuckin touching yourself when he&rsquo;s fucking you and you&rsquo;re rubbing your own clit and you&rsquo;re getting yourself off and just tell him where to put it.</p>
<p>Boom.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re just gonna like start going down.</p>
<p>This little round.</p>
<p>The Jewish girls blonde girls suck.</p>
<p>Apparently, I was talking to my friend and he has a serious Asian fetish.</p>
<p>25:43</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Love that.</p>
<p>I love it to your bodyguard this last weekend with age.</p>
<p>I have one so fucking thousand percent.</p>
<p>Okay, he didn&rsquo;t say that.</p>
<p>They come like Sailor Moon, like an anime.</p>
<p>Give us annoying.</p>
<p>Kind of was it was a little like What about like English?</p>
<p>26:07</p>
<p>People would like accents?</p>
<p>Like, huh?</p>
<p>Like people from the South are like scented come and open.</p>
<p>Okay, let&rsquo;s fucking let&rsquo;s move on.</p>
<p>26:24</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re yeah, sorry.</p>
<p>Sorry, sorry.</p>
<p>Um, okay.</p>
<p>Okay, so last week we talked about crazy.</p>
<p>Drunk sacks and we kind of segwayed for a second because you mentioned yourself falling off.</p>
<p>The bat.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m more excited to talk about this GTO, awkward silence awkward fucking sexual shit.</p>
<p>26:42</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So a ton of people wrote in and said, of course we fallen off the bed.</p>
<p>Yeah, of course, of course, it&rsquo;s like people that have been there probably like what the fuck are those people doing acrobatics like well, like happy.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So this is what I want to talk about in this segment.</p>
<p>26:59</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>What has to happen.</p>
<p>That makes it so awkward that you cannot continue because nine times out of ten for men, they are going to Soldier on and keep going.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s rifle like girl, stop more than guys, for sure.</p>
<p>27:15</p>
<p>But I actually just thought really quickly.</p>
<p>I got a gang member wrote.</p>
<p>It in said.</p>
<p>Yeah, this guy was fucking her like holding her like carrying her.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>He got a cramp in his leg and he dropped her on her head turned off drugs.</p>
<p>I literally landed on my Stop it.</p>
<p>27:34</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a man, no, just pick her back.</p>
<p>I feel like fucking guys are like, it takes a lot.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s like, low-key unconscious, and she&rsquo;s like, I&rsquo;m kind of here.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m kinda.</p>
<p>No, I need you.</p>
<p>So, let&rsquo;s get into it.</p>
<p>I want to first ask you.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>You get your period.</p>
<p>27:50</p>
<p>Do you stop having sex?</p>
<p>It depends?</p>
<p>How bad, mmm, if it&rsquo;s like it.</p>
<p>A crime scene.</p>
<p>Is it, like I kind of soaking.</p>
<p>Okay, first of all, obviously, Obviously, if it&rsquo;s just a little bit of blood anyone out there the fucking pussy, if you stop, if it&rsquo;s a murder scene.</p>
<p>28:06</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s definitely.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a little scary, but I kind of think like fucking extra lube.</p>
<p>A be like if you&rsquo;re like, that&rsquo;s always the go-to, but I do feel like take it to the shower and just keep talking.</p>
<p>I mean, you know, if I&rsquo;m really comfortable with a guy, I don&rsquo;t care if it was like, my first time hanging out with a guy.</p>
<p>28:23</p>
<p>And I started really bleeding.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d probably kind of, like, freaked out.</p>
<p>I agree.</p>
<p>I kind of know.</p>
<p>I, yeah, I think I would kind of keep keep on soul.</p>
<p>Nan, keep on keeping on, keep on, keeping on.</p>
<p>Okay, I have one.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>This is a good one.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re fucking your guy and you are on vacation.</p>
<p>28:40</p>
<p>Your mom opens the door walks in and then hurries and slams it and leave, so you&rsquo;re allowed to be fucking right?</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like you&rsquo;re in your mom&rsquo;s house, right?</p>
<p>And she&rsquo;s like, what the fuck are ya?</p>
<p>Like she&rsquo;s like, oh sorry, like basically right here, your mid.</p>
<p>Fuck your mom opens the door and says, sorry slams, the door and runs away.</p>
<p>28:58</p>
<p>Do you stop backing or do you keep going?</p>
<p>Saying, you know, honestly, I will probably just like pick up my phone and text my mom and be like those jeans baby.</p>
<p>See how flexible my legs.</p>
<p>You know, Mom, you&rsquo;ll be like impressive.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Did you see the size of that thing?</p>
<p>29:15</p>
<p>Mom?</p>
<p>You see that?</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>Okay, in real talk.</p>
<p>I think with my mom, I would probably stop because I&rsquo;d like Bach like she just saw some shit.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d run out and apologize.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>If it was his parents though.</p>
<p>If he was down to keep fucking after they ran out, I think I&rsquo;m all right.</p>
<p>29:33</p>
<p>Well, okay, this also like I also plays into like, we&rsquo;re you guys just getting started or like, are you literally about to go?</p>
<p>Because if you&rsquo;re literally about to come, like, just kind of keep going, like, you just gotta hurry and just like, finish it out and it just started.</p>
<p>I mean, not like, don&rsquo;t just like, if your mom walks in and she&rsquo;s sitting there staring at you, like you.</p>
<p>29:51</p>
<p>Like, I&rsquo;m really I&rsquo;m not don&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>But okay.</p>
<p>No, I agree with you.</p>
<p>I think also I think it depends who it is.</p>
<p>So okay, you said, Mom It was just a rando.</p>
<p>Keep.</p>
<p>Oh my God.</p>
<p>Outside.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been listening.</p>
<p>Oh my God.</p>
<p>A random could literally go into the room and take a seat.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Looks like see.</p>
<p>30:07</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s the performance.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Thanks for coming for.</p>
<p>Ya know.</p>
<p>I agree.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m bringing this up because it actually fucking happens.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>If mid-fuck, one of you farts and it&rsquo;s like is it is it an out loud or is it?</p>
<p>30:23</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s yeah, it smells it&rsquo;s fucking smells dude, dude, that&rsquo;s so So fucking awkward.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, but like, and I, I think it sucks.</p>
<p>Okay, it being out loud is better than it smelling you.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve talked about it on.</p>
<p>30:38</p>
<p>Call me.</p>
<p>Daddy.</p>
<p>If anything comes out of your body.</p>
<p>That sounds fucking weird.</p>
<p>You blame it on a queef and you&rsquo;re like, oh my God, that&rsquo;s how I know.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re fucking me, right, Nora.</p>
<p>Yeah, ignore, but dude, when that shit reeks and like, shit.</p>
<p>Are you have to just fuck?</p>
<p>Yeah, in it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re fucking in your fart.</p>
<p>Like what are you do?</p>
<p>30:54</p>
<p>What the fuck do you do?</p>
<p>Hi, I think you keep going.</p>
<p>You like let&rsquo;s move to the other side of that.</p>
<p>Come on.</p>
<p>Hurry up.</p>
<p>Come on, come on.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go to the other side.</p>
<p>Come on, even more like a sea, and it looks like, you&rsquo;re like, you&rsquo;ve been there before?</p>
<p>31:12</p>
<p>I like not again.</p>
<p>Not again.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like this happens.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just very hard over here, buddy.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>This is, this is an actual phenomenon.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s in the room.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like everyone got such a basic concept, like their dog, or their cat, which is clearly creepiest is like staring at you while you&rsquo;re having sex.</p>
<p>31:33</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t love it, but it&rsquo;s not going to stop me from.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>I have a personal story about this one.</p>
<p>Oh, and this happened like in the last Sophia, let a dog go down on her.</p>
<p>No, peanut butter.</p>
<p>You guys know the drill?</p>
<p>No, I was hooking up with this guy.</p>
<p>31:50</p>
<p>He was going down on me.</p>
<p>Okay, and I was, like, laying on my back and like my legs were spread.</p>
<p>Oh, okay.</p>
<p>No shit.</p>
<p>All right, extra crossed legs were crossed and he shoved his head on there.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>His dog was on the bed already, went out of looking at all.</p>
<p>32:09</p>
<p>But I was just like, okay, the dog, put his little paw on my inner thigh.</p>
<p>Nope, and that&rsquo;s not a joke.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not.</p>
<p>Do you know what I call them?</p>
<p>I called that a fucking threesome with two humans in an animal, you sick.</p>
<p>32:26</p>
<p>Fuck.</p>
<p>Why did you shut it off the bed?</p>
<p>I obviously like dry down.</p>
<p>No, you try to like move them off know.</p>
<p>I obviously scooted him off but like, but it&rsquo;s also awkward because he&rsquo;s eating you out.</p>
<p>32:43</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want to distract him, right?</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s awkward brief moment.</p>
<p>The perversion, like, a module, like this discuss we.</p>
<p>And I thought I was going to say, I remember one time a guy is dog, was at the like, edge of the bed, how they sit there.</p>
<p>And it was kind of like, touching my foot.</p>
<p>33:00</p>
<p>See what else?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Oh, no.</p>
<p>Threesome know that if he has appeared touching your body hurts a threesome.</p>
<p>I agree.</p>
<p>I think if there&rsquo;s a dog or an animal or a cat, whatever it is on the bed, I think you gotta get rid of it.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>But obviously, we don&rsquo;t forget.</p>
<p>33:16</p>
<p>Who are we?</p>
<p>Okay, but that didn&rsquo;t stop me.</p>
<p>Hey, we&rsquo;re disgusting, dude.</p>
<p>Him away.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So so far nothing has stopped us.</p>
<p>Poop.</p>
<p>Farts pets.</p>
<p>What about hair extensions?</p>
<p>This is such a good one.</p>
<p>Like he&rsquo;s he is fucking you from behind.</p>
<p>33:33</p>
<p>And he goes to grab your hair as you should.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>And give it a little tug.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>And your entire track is ripped out of your goddamn head and he literally looks like he&rsquo;s holding like a wig.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think you turn around and you look at him and you snatch it away and you Chuck it across the room and then you just keep fighting with.</p>
<p>33:55</p>
<p>What do you do?</p>
<p>I do not know what I would do in that situation.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re going to keep fucking like I know you all know.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not hers.</p>
<p>Please.</p>
<p>I know, I can&rsquo;t fucking try to act like there are something that would determine.</p>
<p>Well.</p>
<p>No, I actually think this is a great, that&rsquo;s a great topic to bring up.</p>
<p>34:13</p>
<p>What would deter you?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve kind of talked about physical stuff.</p>
<p>Like what would stop us and clearly nothing has yet.</p>
<p>So let us talk about vocal shit.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a lot of times in the bedroom that when you&rsquo;re fucking there is room for some awkward.</p>
<p>34:30</p>
<p>Fuck your things to be said, dirty talk can Fuck you, especially if you&rsquo;re like me and I literally never stop talking.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, you&rsquo;re like, I want you to fuck me.</p>
<p>Like, your little Schoolboy and you&rsquo;re like, I&rsquo;m, he&rsquo;s girl, girl, girl, like the SEC.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a little boy, like, he&rsquo;s gonna look at you weird.</p>
<p>34:45</p>
<p>Not you said that Ike accidentally before any guys.</p>
<p>Like, excuse.</p>
<p>I could see guys being kind of freaked out by that one or even if you just fuck up a word, like if you say ho and slut and you&rsquo;re like, fuck me like you&rsquo;re a little slow and he&rsquo;s like, oh like what?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re what you keep fuck, you keep on chugging.</p>
<p>35:02</p>
<p>Let me tell you vocally, how I fucked up once because it like pains my heart for me and him.</p>
<p>So I was fucking around with this guy.</p>
<p>And you know, when you&rsquo;re in that stage like you&rsquo;re talking you really like each other, but you have not said I love you yet.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s always on the mind.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like, I don&rsquo;t want him to say it.</p>
<p>35:19</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re fucking and I went to say, I love you inside of me.</p>
<p>Oh, and I, we were in missionary.</p>
<p>So we were making eye contact and I look up at him and I say and I was fucked up and I go, I Love you.</p>
<p>Oh my gosh, the head with a wine bottle.</p>
<p>35:37</p>
<p>Like why?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like cringe it right now so fucking awkward and he ended up just fucking Me Harder and like, kiss me because he thought that I like actually fucking meant it.</p>
<p>I think I may have done something similar just fucking sucks.</p>
<p>I it&rsquo;s fucking sucks.</p>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t you tell me about a guy said he was gonna kill you, you know, Sophia, I didn&rsquo;t want to bring it up, but I guess we can bring it up.</p>
<p>36:01</p>
<p>Yeah, um, Guys, I was hooking up with this guy.</p>
<p>He came to New York to visit me and we like smoked weed.</p>
<p>And so I was like a little paranoid, because he was making jokes like, oh my God, like none of your friends know you&rsquo;re here.</p>
<p>Like I could be a serial killer and kill you.</p>
<p>36:17</p>
<p>And no one would ever know when I was like, haha, funny.</p>
<p>And then we started fucking and it was like, pretty kinky sex and then he took it to a level where, like and think of it when you&rsquo;re high.</p>
<p>So everything is heightened anxiety wise.</p>
<p>He started like choking me, which I So, hot, and then all of a sudden, he literally was just like, I could fucking kill you right now, and his hands were around my neck.</p>
<p>36:39</p>
<p>And I was like, you know, I love sexual intercourse right now.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I actually are we.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve actually had a guy tell me that too.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had a real quick like all.</p>
<p>Yes, the classic when they strangle you and say, they&rsquo;re gonna kill you, mid-fuck.</p>
<p>36:56</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve all the good old days actually my ex-boyfriend because like, we would like sometimes I kind of like play around without something like it was, when he&rsquo;d be Choking me, like, I could kill you.</p>
<p>Like, oh, actually quickly.</p>
<p>Let me just segue.</p>
<p>I just remembered I had, but I had a post-appointment flashback, but not a good one in college.</p>
<p>37:14</p>
<p>I, I actually drunkenly peed all over a guy.</p>
<p>So, just fuck me now.</p>
<p>No, dude.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s coming in, just like a little p.</p>
<p>Like I sat there and actually marinated him and his thighs of Dick with my pee.</p>
<p>Dude.</p>
<p>37:29</p>
<p>We were fucking, I was on top of him.</p>
<p>I was sitting on top of him on the couch.</p>
<p>And I remember being so fucked up.</p>
<p>And I was saying to myself, damn, like, I really feel like I&rsquo;m going to pee, but you know, how you have that feeling, sometimes when you&rsquo;re going to come.</p>
<p>So, I ended up in my blackout having a full stream P.</p>
<p>37:46</p>
<p>Just coming out.</p>
<p>I was on top of him.</p>
<p>And I remember, I think I tried to play it off, like, I squirted.</p>
<p>And then I fucking knew the next morning because he was, like, discuss.</p>
<p>Now is like, who was that?</p>
<p>That was a little kid.</p>
<p>38:03</p>
<p>Fuck you.</p>
<p>I learned something new about you every day.</p>
<p>Yeah, fuck me.</p>
<p>I just really am ruining my life on this podcast, but I dude, I mean that&rsquo;s so that&rsquo;s so disgusting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not really, I&rsquo;m pretty sure guys are into it.</p>
<p>Do whatever he fucking love Donald.</p>
<p>So whatever Donald Trump missionary missionary.</p>
<p>38:23</p>
<p>So you know what?</p>
<p>I think this is a world phenomenon that a lot of women.</p>
<p>Sadly don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s equivalent.</p>
<p>You actually it&rsquo;s probably worse.</p>
<p>But when we talk about girls getting it from behind and when they have the Hunchback of Notre Dame and they don&rsquo;t like stick out their app.</p>
<p>38:39</p>
<p>Disgusting horrible, all wrong.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking missionary really quickly with my love me so much.</p>
<p>I actually do too.</p>
<p>I think in the past episode I said no, but I really do just with the right?</p>
<p>Kind of guy, that knows how to fuck a scenario.</p>
<p>So the point of this topic is to talk about all of our dead fish is out there.</p>
<p>38:58</p>
<p>Give them a round of applause, girls girls.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sometimes girls.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an epidemic.</p>
<p>Emma a, they take the whole missionary position and they think they can be lazy.</p>
<p>They think it&rsquo;s time for a nap like at they can catch a quick nap before round two and a different position.</p>
<p>So this is a little PSA, any female that is listening to call her daddy if you are laying in missionary.</p>
<p>39:23</p>
<p>Yeah, and you are not talking.</p>
<p>Yeah thrusting thrusting.</p>
<p>A being and doing things with your hands.</p>
<p>Yeah, you are doing.</p>
<p>Sax wrong.</p>
<p>Okay, just just a side note because it might sound like we&rsquo;re picking on girls.</p>
<p>Guys, do this to own.</p>
<p>39:38</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>I know guys that don&rsquo;t that don&rsquo;t just want to be a missionary donkey on top and for sure the ride the yeah, fuck out little bitch boy.</p>
<p>Genders can be lazy.</p>
<p>But so burn talk about girls missionary girls.</p>
<p>I will never forget.</p>
<p>So I think it was my freshman year of high school.</p>
<p>And this kid was dating the hottest girl, and we were at a party and he got drunk and he ended up saying guys, she&rsquo;s hot as shit.</p>
<p>40:02</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But she fucks like a dead fish and I had never heard the term dead fish before.</p>
<p>So I was like, we, what the fuck?</p>
<p>Well, I literally feel like I&rsquo;m fucking a dead.</p>
<p>Well, guess what?</p>
<p>The hotter, the girl, the worst.</p>
<p>She is right.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>Okay, so a five or so, folks, died for that dick five or six times a good five or six out of ten on a scale of hardness.</p>
<p>40:22</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna fuck like a crazy walk.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re nine or ten, you got, you gotta plan times are dead Faith.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why if any nines or tens are listening.</p>
<p>Listen up.</p>
<p>Yeah, so girls, first, For most Sofia.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just talk about Basics.</p>
<p>Yeah, you should be talking when you&rsquo;re in missionary.</p>
<p>40:39</p>
<p>Can you talk to us a little bit about that?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s one thing that I do is I don&rsquo;t shut the fuck up.</p>
<p>I think I think in fact I had guys put a hand over my mouth, please shove a sock on my mouth and they&rsquo;re like, keep a bit quiet I could.</p>
<p>So see that.</p>
<p>40:55</p>
<p>I love that.</p>
<p>I talked the entire guys, talking and missionary is so fucking important because it&rsquo;s your opportunity, like he&rsquo;s in He&rsquo;s going to Pound Town.</p>
<p>You are.</p>
<p>You have that eye?</p>
<p>Contact moment.</p>
<p>You should be saying, fuck baby.</p>
<p>That feels so good.</p>
<p>41:10</p>
<p>Keep fucking me just like that.</p>
<p>You like that.</p>
<p>Secondly, while you&rsquo;re doing that dirty talk, you are not fucking laying there with your hands down, just like fucking laying like you&rsquo;re taking it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>You should not be acting like you&rsquo;re just taking it.</p>
<p>So what are you gonna do with your hands?</p>
<p>You can mix it up.</p>
<p>41:26</p>
<p>Always.</p>
<p>Okay, I think let&rsquo;s start with the grabbing.</p>
<p>Well, the grabbing.</p>
<p>Okay, grab his inner thigh.</p>
<p>Grab his inner thigh, grab his arm, grab his bicep, Rob, his fucking back, and the back of his thigh.</p>
<p>That is, if you take the back of his legs or thighs, or his ass girls and you start pushing it towards yourself thrusting.</p>
<p>41:47</p>
<p>It.</p>
<p>It kind of indicates to him.</p>
<p>I want you more.</p>
<p>I want you deeper that to a guy is fucking hot because it&rsquo;s like God damn.</p>
<p>She wants more of me amazing on a basic level.</p>
<p>I think before you even start grabbing him, you can Clench the bed sheet or /?</p>
<p>42:05</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Arm up and clench the hell.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Fuck.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Visual is.</p>
<p>So it because it shows that you&rsquo;re so into it and it feels good.</p>
<p>Also, hi girls.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a thing called titties.</p>
<p>We have boobs.</p>
<p>You should be grabbing your tips, even grabbed his hand and put them on your tips.</p>
<p>42:23</p>
<p>Okay, here is something that a lot of girls are just not doing in missionary.</p>
<p>So bear with us.</p>
<p>If you do this, I already know what you&rsquo;re gonna.</p>
<p>You already know.</p>
<p>You have a clique Girlz.</p>
<p>Go to town on your fucking touch.</p>
<p>Lit yourself.</p>
<p>This position could not be better to touch your Godlike.</p>
<p>42:39</p>
<p>Seriously.</p>
<p>Yes, you are gonna go down girls and you&rsquo;re going to start.</p>
<p>Massaging your clit.</p>
<p>Do your thing, go to work.</p>
<p>And while you&rsquo;re doing that, you&rsquo;re going to be looking up at him and you&rsquo;re going to be like fuck baby.</p>
<p>That feels so good.</p>
<p>I want all of you.</p>
<p>Keep fucking me like that.</p>
<p>42:55</p>
<p>Oh my God.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so wet.</p>
<p>Do you want me to come?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re saying all the right things and you&rsquo;re making eye contact with him.</p>
<p>This is something that I also do in missionary that I want to be careful because there is a certain like level you should be doing it and the amount you do it.</p>
<p>43:12</p>
<p>So when a guy starts going at a pretty specific rate, like when he&rsquo;s like pounding the pussy and he&rsquo;s going at a certain rate.</p>
<p>What I try to do is I pay attention to that speed and I lift my hips up off my bed rest and I start.</p>
<p>43:30</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Yeah, it the next.</p>
<p>And I swear to God girls your hips are going to be so fucking sore but you get a little bit off and you stay off the bed the whole time and you just go up and then back to that like off the bed position, right?</p>
<p>And you try to get in exact Unison with him.</p>
<p>43:45</p>
<p>So what ends up happening is, you are like slamming him at the same time that he&rsquo;s contacting you.</p>
<p>Yeah, and usually what happens is, it will make a sound like his balls will be like hitting the back of your like past area.</p>
<p>And guys, I swear to God.</p>
<p>I already know two guys in my mind that Actually come.</p>
<p>44:03</p>
<p>Every time I do this, if you can put in work with your hips for like almost 32 seconds to a minute and you keep just going to fucking pound town with him.</p>
<p>He would be like, holy fuck.</p>
<p>Sounds sounds are huge.</p>
<p>44:19</p>
<p>Like your roots wet.</p>
<p>Yeah, hearing how sloppy and hearing just like this slapping motion.</p>
<p>So fucking hot.</p>
<p>And I think girls also what?</p>
<p>I just told you don&rsquo;t do that too much in too long because he may want to change.</p>
<p>His pace and then you also if you get out of rhythm, you&rsquo;re kind of fucked.</p>
<p>44:36</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a little awkward to just make sure you do it for a little bit and then stop but the whole grabby.</p>
<p>Also, the clipping fucking lick your fingers after you come back from touching yourself.</p>
<p>Totally tell him to fucking choke you over and over that.</p>
<p>Or after you&rsquo;re done, like, touching your clip, put your fingers in his mouth.</p>
<p>44:53</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So girls that just like a little, a little missionary.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>A little bit of a reminder for all of our homies out there that are the daddy game.</p>
<p>Fucking move in when you&rsquo;re down there.</p>
<p>All right, we&rsquo;ve talked about scorned women in the past.</p>
<p>Well, there is such a thing as a scorned man, do their fucking heads.</p>
<p>45:11</p>
<p>I have witnessed it firsthand and I&rsquo;ve been a part of it and that would be my ex-boyfriend shout out.</p>
<p>What he did to me.</p>
<p>I would never say that.</p>
<p>I deserved it, but I did not.</p>
<p>I mean it was crazy.</p>
<p>It was a little crazy.</p>
<p>45:27</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m just gonna get into it.</p>
<p>I think everybody loves Sophia crazy stories.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s guy.</p>
<p>Do I do?</p>
<p>Alex just makes me sell my soul to make yourself for the Pod Gotti.</p>
<p>Okay?</p>

<p>46:39</p>
<p>We were varying each other&rsquo;s lives in each other&rsquo;s?</p>
<p>Felt like he would know.</p>
<p>He would have no got it.</p>
<p>So you had to hit it with the mom.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s our.</p>
<p>I call my mom thinking.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m calling my actual mother.</p>
<p>Okay, a man answers the phone bastard and I&rsquo;m like, hi is my mom there?</p>

<p>So, out of fucking nowhere.</p>
<p>You have a girl coming to visit you, and she calls you.</p>
<p>And she&rsquo;s like, where would I mock?</p>

<p>47:30</p>
<p>Okay, so my boyfriend thinks Out there something up, right?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, I know you&rsquo;re going to go to New York.</p>
<p>I guess do your thing.</p>
<p>Okay, mind you he re scene techs between me and this guy and he had like some idea that maybe something could go down, but he was still going to.</p>
<p>47:46</p>
<p>Let me go to New York.</p>
<p>Anyways, I have family here.</p>
<p>Okay, so I just thought I was going to stay a family.</p>
<p>I touched down in New York and I get to the airport.</p>
<p>Turn my phone on right off the bat.</p>
<p>My boyfriend is like, who is picking you up from the airport?</p>
<p>48:02</p>
<p>Here.</p>
<p>Ah, so, you know, I knew I wasn&rsquo;t going to get away with no knees.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like touchdown and you&rsquo;re already getting tracked.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s scary, scary feeling.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m at the airport.</p>

<p>So he was just hitting you up so much.</p>
<p>You just had no other option.</p>
<p>There was no other option.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m with this John guy and this John guy is, like, why the hell is this girl here in New York and she&rsquo;s just on her phone and you guys are thinking like why the fuck did you even?</p>
<p>50:21</p>
<p>Like stay with your boyfriend right now of your traveling across the country to see another guy?</p>
<p>He had an extremely tumultuous relationship.</p>
<p>There was a lot of money to explain it down.</p>
<p>Toby.</p>
<p>I should board it.</p>
<p>We did you not try to just like pop out for a minute and like FaceTime him.</p>
<p>50:38</p>
<p>I went into the hallway and I tried and I think it just looked so sketchy like why are you sitting on the stairs in the hallway?</p>
<p>Like that was even were there.</p>
<p>That didn&rsquo;t work until you blocked it.</p>
<p>So he he just was relentless.</p>
<p>He wasn&rsquo;t stopping.</p>
<p>I hit him with a block, and I was like, I&rsquo;m fucked.</p>
<p>50:55</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m here.</p>
<p>In fact, there is he knows what&rsquo;s happening?</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s no way I can get out of this lie.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m screwed.</p>
<p>So, you just, I spend the rest of that weekend, kind of taking him off blocks.</p>
<p>Okay, sending him stuff like you&rsquo;re being crazy, like your fucking cheerleader.</p>
<p>51:12</p>
<p>Leah, slut.</p>
<p>You like what?</p>
<p>So, I think it was the third night.</p>
<p>I was there and I go to acne with John.</p>
<p>Okay, that&rsquo;s a restaurant for anyone that does.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And John says, John pulls up his Facebook and shows me a picture of my boyfriend and he was like, taking a turn is like, is this like is this your ex or something?</p>
<p>51:41</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, really don&rsquo;t like crumbly.</p>
<p>How the fuck did you polygons?</p>
<p>Yeah, my ex my current boyfriend.</p>
<p>I like how the hell&rsquo;d, and I actually think that I had made comments throughout that weekend, kind of saying my boyfriend ex-boyfriend like I Guy did screw up a couple perfect, beautiful, whatever.</p>
<p>51:58</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m like, yeah, actually I did date that person.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s up, he shows me a Facebook message.</p>
<p>Nope.</p>
<p>Nope, from my ex.</p>
<p>Nope, and it says just so, you know, Sophia Franklin is a huge whore and she gave me herpes.</p>
<p>52:19</p>
<p>So good luck with that.</p>
<p>No, I I wanted to die because this, I got already thinks you&rsquo;re crazy.</p>
<p>Just keep fucking called him in.</p>
<p>Like Mom&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m crazy.</p>
<p>Um, we&rsquo;ve been fucking without a condom.</p>
<p>52:36</p>
<p>Oh, and he&rsquo;s like, and he doesn&rsquo;t know me that.</p>
<p>Well, he&rsquo;s like hi.</p>
<p>So, do you have herpes?</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t know, someone that well, and you get a message like that, you&rsquo;re like, hey, how about this situation with this song?</p>
<p>I wanted to die.</p>
<p>I wanted to die.</p>
<p>Would you ever do something like that?</p>
<p>52:53</p>
<p>If your And was full-blown cheating.</p>
<p>Would you like, try and like spread a STD rumor?</p>
<p>You know what?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not gonna say Never Say Never, but I do think there&rsquo;s something about STDs and lying because at the end of the day, you just look fucking stupid.</p>
<p>53:10</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re lying about it because obviously those people are going to get tested when they don&rsquo;t have herpes 1, you&rsquo;re spreading light and to the bitch, then that means you have herpes you.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s like embarrassing, right?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I would ever do the STD route, but that&rsquo;s fucking Was it was so what did you end up doing?</p>
<p>53:26</p>
<p>Were you just like what the well, you know what?</p>
<p>Interestingly enough and I like, had so much respect for John.</p>
<p>What did you do?</p>
<p>Because I was like, I am so sorry.</p>
<p>Can you like screenshot that and send it to me?</p>
<p>Because, you know, I obviously wanted right, right?</p>
<p>And he was like, no, he was like, I&rsquo;m an adult.</p>
<p>53:44</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not gonna like be in the middle of like this image coming in like, wow, and he was just like, I&rsquo;m going to delete it.</p>
<p>Oh my God, he didn&rsquo;t care and we did.</p>
<p>Later that night without a condom.</p>
<p>Oh my God, which he did?</p>
<p>So he just believe that you didn&rsquo;t have herpes.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s actually a really stand-up guy.</p>
<p>54:01</p>
<p>What a great guy John was because your ex-boyfriend, you know, your boyfriend.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t even matter.</p>
<p>The scoring.</p>
<p>Wow, thing is a scorned man.</p>
<p>I bet that&rsquo;s pretty shocking shitty for me.</p>
<p>If someone is going to fuck me over, someone&rsquo;s gonna cheat on me.</p>
<p>54:17</p>
<p>I just hit it with a block and, yeah, you know, length.</p>
<p>But he went is kind of like, I don&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t really Vengeful, right, right.</p>
<p>Right, right.</p>
<p>So I think that&rsquo;s kind of creepy dude, but wow, next relationship out.</p>

<p>I wish I could release it.</p>
<p>You can I&rsquo;m thinking absolutely can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Okay fine help our career here.</p>
<p>So the fuck.</p>
<p>So I was like, I don&rsquo;t know how to explain it, but I was laying on the bed.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even know how to explain it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t I just, I just know that I had a little tank top on like very, very baby.</p>
<p>56:33</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like, basically just covering - oh, yeah, a little tank, top thing and it like stops at my belly button, and then I had a thong on.</p>
<p>Oh, I could see.</p>
<p>And so, my tits were basically out, my nips, were hard.</p>
<p>So it looked hot as shit.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, my thong was, I could see how that would be, and I had like my hand in my thong and it was hot.</p>
<p>56:50</p>
<p>So I think I agree with you.</p>
<p>I think sometimes if you have something on it&rsquo;s almost harder.</p>
<p>I just thought that was so interesting because my First reaction to that.</p>
<p>I was like you are a bitch boy and a virgin and like why?</p>
<p>I actually just thought of this one thing my hairdresser accidentally sent or not sent me showed me a nude on his phone.</p>
<p>57:09</p>
<p>He was showing me pictures of hairstyles and I was like a woman.</p>
<p>She was an older woman and the post she was doing.</p>
<p>She was in front of a mirror, told me about this crazy.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s in front of a mirror.</p>
<p>She had heels on and nothing else on and she squatted down.</p>
<p>57:24</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So like she was in a squat position with her, but her legs like her.</p>
<p>Spread open and she had the phone up so straight.</p>
<p>I mean, like that&rsquo;s fucked.</p>
<p>Like, straight vagina vagina, everything out in and taking the mirror.</p>
<p>So it was a full-length mirror and she was just squatting and legs open.</p>
<p>57:40</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s yeah, really sad.</p>
<p>Stop it.</p>
<p>So, we talked about nudes in another episode.</p>
<p>Should you should I just thought that?</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s what I just add.</p>
<p>Maybe add a little.</p>
<p>Yeah, okay, okay.</p>
<p>I was walking to class and this guy I had hooked up with saw me and started walking towards me.</p>
<p>57:58</p>
<p>I hadn&rsquo;t made eye contact yet, but I had been ignoring him for two weeks.</p>
<p>He came up to me, and I took my headphones out and looked at him, like I didn&rsquo;t know who he was, and he was like, how are you?</p>
<p>And said, my name?</p>
<p>I looked at him and I said, oh, I&rsquo;m actually her sister.</p>
<p>58:14</p>
<p>But, no worries.</p>
<p>We can.</p>
<p>We look a lot alike.</p>
<p>It happens all the time.</p>
<p>He looked at me with his mouth open and I said, I&rsquo;ll tell my sister.</p>
<p>You said hi.</p>
<p>No and walked away.</p>
<p>We have not spoken since.</p>
<p>Oh, this could be - we because what can you say you&rsquo;re like, well, no, I thought and you&rsquo;re like, no, that&rsquo;s my sister.</p>
<p>58:34</p>
<p>But like we did we always look like Dude that fucking genius if you really don&rsquo;t want to talk to someone and you just lie.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve loved me too.</p>
<p>Because what are they gonna say?</p>
<p>No, you&rsquo;re lying.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m not and then you just go back and forth.</p>
<p>Do you an identity thing?</p>
<p>Take some balls that dot I kind of roll.</p>
<p>58:49</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m injured basically just fake that your you.</p>
<p>Whatever exists.</p>
<p>Fuck.</p>
<p>Okay, go.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>How do you say wetter for longer?</p>
<p>When you don&rsquo;t have Lube, like sometimes you&rsquo;re turned on and everything but it&rsquo;s going on for so long that you can&rsquo;t stay wet, especially when you&rsquo;re drunk.</p>
<p>59:06</p>
<p>Okay, a.</p>

<p>Yeah, you should be and talk about that and we Zuni&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>Yeah, spit all the time.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a 26 year old.</p>
<p>Mayor mail.</p>
<p>59:38</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m getting married in a couple months.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always wanted to sleep with a grandma and not like a 50 year old granny.</p>
<p>But like I Sadi 67 plus granny.</p>
<p>One.</p>
<p>Am I really fucking weird too.</p>
<p>Could I ever bring this up to my fiance and Three.</p>
<p>Should I go for it?</p>
<p>59:53</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>Hashtag the great me.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So we I think, what would you do if your pussy only?</p>
<p>She can like tired tits in a bow.</p>
<p>Like yeah, baby.</p>
<p>1:00:10</p>
<p>What would you do?</p>
<p>If your boyfriend said that he wanted to fuck an old grandma?</p>
<p>I honestly do like that is what&rsquo;s gonna make you happy.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s gonna get evolved enough to fucking help.</p>
<p>Faith is the fucking going to the geriatric Rao the gold or babe nursing home then go for it and report back to go for it.</p>
<p>1:00:34</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m sure you would look great when he comes back to you.</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>It sounds like he kind of is into you know, he&rsquo;s into some shit.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think that&rsquo;s kind of fun.</p>
<p>I supported go for it.</p>
<p>We love Kinks and you guys fucking come up with some crazy Kings.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re horny, but I&rsquo;m a here for it.</p>
<p>1:00:50</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>This was a good one.</p>
<p>When is it okay to leave someone you are seeing over rumors that you here?</p>
<p>For example, you hear that they&rsquo;re hooking up with other people, but you don&rsquo;t have proof.</p>
<p>Do you walk away or believe his big-dicked ass shit.</p>
<p>1:01:10</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s actually such a good question.</p>
<p>This is a really tough one because I don&rsquo;t think you can break up with someone over rumors.</p>
<p>I this is I mean Levels one.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So let me like paint a picture.</p>
<p>Okay, you&rsquo;re dating a guy and hit like you have had not one, not two, but multiple multiple people approach you and say he is cheating.</p>
<p>1:01:36</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, if you&rsquo;re having like five different people who have no ulterior motives.</p>
<p>Yeah, then I kind of think you gotta like, listen a little bit and do some investigation but I mean, she&rsquo;s like, I guess she like can&rsquo;t find anything like I&rsquo;m assuming she&rsquo;s tried to find stuff in can&rsquo;t well, I think she needs to listen.</p>
<p>1:01:52</p>
<p>Into this podcast a little bit harder, right?</p>
<p>Literally trying all of our hacks like girlfriend.</p>
<p>You gotta get.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Wait, that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>Yes, so don&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t leave him until you have proof but you got to get into the IP.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re sitting there saying, oh, I like can&rsquo;t figure it out.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a woman and you can, you got yeah.</p>
<p>1:02:09</p>
<p>I think I think it&rsquo;s really hard.</p>
<p>Sometimes.</p>
<p>Especially like, in college settings, people are going to talk, and I think that I would never leave someone over rumor.</p>
<p>What if like, what had his friends.</p>
<p>His own friends were going up to you and saying, look like Mike is, yeah, then I think that I think I would I would have to I think I would believe that.</p>
<p>1:02:32</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>What did the friends are, just trying to fuck you or they&rsquo;re like trying to get him out of a relationship.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I think I kind of feel like I&rsquo;m at that stage, but I&rsquo;m his mom.</p>
<p>Oh, oh, you know, I&rsquo;ve had some fucking crazy mothers of guys that I&rsquo;ve dated so know that they&rsquo;re cheating.</p>
<p>1:02:51</p>
<p>No, but like they they&rsquo;ve been so crazy.</p>
<p>Like I can&rsquo;t even get into it, but I wouldn&rsquo;t trust them.</p>
<p>So, I really think you kind of need a little bit of beautiful.</p>
<p>I think you got it.</p>
<p>You gotta hide you to just in the off chance that he wasn&rsquo;t doing anything, and you like ruin a relationship.</p>
<p>1:03:06</p>
<p>I agree.</p>
<p>Totally.</p>
<p>This is an interesting one.</p>
<p>Hey, do y&rsquo;all have named deal-breakers?</p>
<p>Like, if someone had this name, you could not date /.</p>
<p>Fuck them.</p>
<p>No matter how hot.</p>
<p>We, that&rsquo;s actually such a good fucking question.</p>
<p>You know why?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because you are imagining.</p>
<p>1:03:22</p>
<p>Saying their name during sex.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s what it is.</p>
<p>Yes, you don&rsquo;t want to be laying there and be like fucking funny.</p>
<p>Fuck me.</p>
<p>Ernie fuckery.</p>
<p>Hello, Ernie Gary.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I think he&rsquo;s worth about like Angus, Angus.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t stop.</p>
<p>I actually would be fine with Barney.</p>
<p>1:03:38</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re hitting it right there.</p>
<p>Dick dick.</p>
<p>Just straight up day.</p>
<p>Hit it there dick, dude, Ernie Barney.</p>
<p>I know it.</p>
<p>I did not is your name.</p>
<p>I think you should.</p>
<p>Just kind of just people about a million people.</p>
<p>Somebody on me.</p>
<p>You asked me, have you ever fucked an Alex?</p>
<p>1:03:55</p>
<p>And was it weird?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re both Alex.</p>
<p>And I like the man says I have, but yes, you have.</p>
<p>Was it weird?</p>
<p>No, do girls, who say that, they&rsquo;re on their period are really on it or they just don&rsquo;t want to fuck.</p>
<p>That is so, such a good question.</p>
<p>1:04:12</p>
<p>I have absolutely I will totally admit in my days.</p>
<p>I have lied them on my period to get out of fucking a guy.</p>
<p>Everyone everyone.</p>
<p>Everyone has the thing.</p>
<p>That is so fucking funny is when you like go into it, you&rsquo;re like Sorry, like I have my period and then you&rsquo;re like halfway through the hangout and you start getting horny and you&rsquo;re like, we I actually kind of down to fuck this guy.</p>
<p>1:04:29</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s actually no blood at all.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re like, oh my God, I was on the last day.</p>
<p>Oh my God, like, all of a sudden it disappeared.</p>
<p>Like what the fuck?</p>
<p>Yeah, got guys.</p>
<p>Just so, you know, like then paroled.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also been on my beard.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;ve had like a guy in college that would make girls show him their tampon string because he wouldn&rsquo;t believe that he&rsquo;s like, show me your tampon string.</p>
<p>1:04:46</p>
<p>You fucking liar.</p>
<p>How fucking scary what are you doing?</p>
<p>That is terrifying.</p>
<p>Like, I don&rsquo;t need To show you that you&rsquo;ve psycho.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That it is kind of greedy.</p>
<p>I think got girls lie about it all the time just for different reasons.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll see their tampons right now.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just kidding.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>1:05:01</p>
<p>I am currently studying abroad and I have a boyfriend back home.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to cheat on him.</p>
<p>But I also kind of do, I don&rsquo;t necessarily want to break things off because it&rsquo;s not that.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t love him but meeting so many different people here makes me realize I have next to nothing in common with him.</p>
<p>1:05:17</p>
<p>Compared to the people.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve met here.</p>
<p>Am I an asshole for feeling this way for literally wanting to cheat on my boyfriend?</p>
<p>But not wanting to end things with him.</p>
<p>No, you are not enough snow.</p>
<p>I feel like that happens all the time.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m assuming that you are in your 20s or younger and to that I say sweetie.</p>
<p>1:05:34</p>
<p>This is probably fucked up advice.</p>
<p>But like you should be you trying things out.</p>
<p>You should live your life.</p>
<p>I think that happens so much when like, people go study abroad or if you move and your boyfriend&rsquo;s back in your hometown, it&rsquo;s like that always happens where that person is experiencing new things.</p>
<p>1:05:51</p>
<p>And your You&rsquo;re integrating yourself and it&rsquo;s like when people go to college and then there are other significant, other goes to a deferral.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s such like going abroad.</p>
<p>And yeah, it&rsquo;s such an like an incredible experience in your forming like super intense.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re enjoying yourself and you&rsquo;re kind of just like, in a fuck it.</p>
<p>1:06:07</p>
<p>I want to do everything mood.</p>
<p>I honestly think like enjoy yourself and whatever stays in that country.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s in that country.</p>
<p>Like don&rsquo;t say anything legit.</p>
<p>She like, doesn&rsquo;t want to break up with him.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m like, well, I think I would just, like, do whatever you want to do.</p>
<p>Oh my God, are we so horrible?</p>
<p>Except for the fact, They&rsquo;re so fucking young.</p>
<p>1:06:23</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m getting married.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s different.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re in here fucking twenties and you&rsquo;re in school.</p>
<p>I can do whatever you want to do.</p>
<p>If you love the kid back home, that&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>But enjoy yourself and go home and you&rsquo;re never going to probably see those people again.</p>
<p>So unless you&rsquo;re planning on having a relationship with someone you met then just fuck it Vegas stays in Vegas ends and fucking Prague stays in Prague fucking a um, okay, this is like a kind of daddy situation.</p>
<p>1:06:48</p>
<p>So I figured out how to basically get past my girlfriend, that sounds normal.</p>
<p>So, I will go or at least stop my car at a friend&rsquo;s place or a neutral spot that she wouldn&rsquo;t get mad at if she saw my location.</p>
<p>1:07:05</p>
<p>So once I&rsquo;m there, I will open SnapChat.</p>
<p>So my location updates and it shows her that I&rsquo;m there.</p>
<p>And then once I&rsquo;m there, I&rsquo;ll go to my settings and I will change the Snapchat location to use.</p>
<p>That way I can use my Snapchat and other social media and go wherever I want and it won&rsquo;t change the location of my bitmoji.</p>
<p>1:07:25</p>
<p>And I can go back to snapping other girls and hanging out with other girls.</p>
<p>So basically the last place that her the girlfriend will see, he was was like at his friend&rsquo;s place or like his house or some not even at house, whatever.</p>
<p>But I think that&rsquo;s like pretty brilliant because girlfriends can be crazy.</p>
<p>And so if they at least just see that you&rsquo;re somewhere, she&rsquo;s like, okay, he&rsquo;s fine and then he&rsquo;s fucking fucking around.</p>
<p>1:07:45</p>
<p>I know plenty of girls, I would fall for the, oh my God.</p>
<p>Girl should do that, too.</p>
<p>I mean, I think that&rsquo;s great because I think it&rsquo;s crazy how like we have all these social media platforms and it shows when you&rsquo;re active and where you are.</p>
<p>And so we Snapchat, you got to cover your ass.</p>
<p>Your girlfriend doesn&rsquo;t know where the fuck you are.</p>
<p>Whoo.</p>
<p>1:08:02</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I want to hear all of your awkward, sex toys.</p>
<p>I also would really like, for you guys to just like, DM the call her daddy Instagram, and let us know, like, what would be your limit?</p>
<p>Because I know so.</p>
<p>Fat are not fucking right in the head and nothing is weird for us, but I want to hear, I mean, I mean to you daddies and also as always, if you guys can, please subscribe or grab a random person&rsquo;s phone and subscribe.</p>
<p>1:08:26</p>
<p>I know like we sound annoying but like it helps us so much so much.</p>
<p>Also, if you guys in a review, that&rsquo;s true, baby, baby.</p>
<p>I love you.</p>
<p>I love you.</p>
<p>We love you.</p>
<p>Love you guys will see you next week every fucking Weinstein.</p>
