<p>Hey, Michelle, I got a question for you. All right, Lindsay. Hi. What&rsquo;s the question?</p>
<p>Well, do you have an easy time kind of making friends and sort of figuring out how to connect with them?</p>
<p>Like with that one person, you know, what is it about them that you could bring out in them and that connection?</p>
<p>Is that easy or what do you think? Well, Lindsay, I think that like I mean, I like to think that it&rsquo;s easy</p>
<p>I think what makes it easy and we&rsquo;ve talked about this before it&rsquo;s like just like finding things that you have in common</p>
<p>yeah, and that&rsquo;s when like the conversation really gets going but like</p>
<p>sometimes you might</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not always that do you have a bunch of stuff in common that will lead to like a lot of exciting?</p>
<p>Conversation you have to kind of find it. You do have to find it. Yeah, and that can be hard, you know</p>
<p>Not everyone takes the time though to try to do it</p>
<p>But I think it does make sense if you can take a little extra time and figure out what your angle is</p>
<p>I bet that applies to your kids too, right to connecting with your children. I know a lot of our listeners are</p>
<p>parents, but today we&rsquo;re gonna find out about a</p>
<p>Strategy that goes way beyond just parenting right Michelle. Yeah, absolutely</p>
<p>Yeah, a lot of things from real life. Just make me think of you know, how can this apply to you know?</p>
<p>Connecting in any situation</p>
<p>Language learning or whatever it is</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>yeah, I mean this is really, you know, I&rsquo;ll tell you more in a minute but just as my about my experience as a mom and</p>
<p>Like how I&rsquo;ve found to like really get even closer. I mean my my daughter is like a real baby right now</p>
<p>So she doesn&rsquo;t have interest</p>
<p>Shake a little rattle, but that&rsquo;s about it</p>
<p>Um, but yeah, so we&rsquo;ll talk more about that in a second. But guys we want to say thank you so much to those who</p>
<p>Have reviewed us right? Thank you to our reviewers. And if you haven&rsquo;t reviewed us yet, right Lindsay, what should they do?</p>
<p>I think you guys got to go leave us a review right leave us a review</p>
<p>Let us know what you think about the show special. Thank you to quay real rip from the u.s</p>
<p>TD tubes and from Switzerland</p>
<p>Donine SF from the u.s. Thank you to</p>
<p>A foot teach from Iran and you&rsquo;re on who from the Czech Republic</p>
<p>I love that these reviews Michelle are from all over the world. Most of them are five-star reviews, by the way</p>
<p>Fantastic. Thank you. And one of them here. They asked a question and I&rsquo;m about to put this question into our list here</p>
<p>Yeah, great place to put your questions and just let us know what you think about the show guys read and we&rsquo;ll try to read</p>
<p>Your name on the show. Okay, good stuff. Excellent</p>
<p>Alright, so thank you guys so much. So what I was saying was that</p>
<p>One of the things that so, you know little kids they get really into</p>
<p>Their fates. It&rsquo;s like so my my son used to love like Thomas the Train. Yeah, and</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s this show Paw Patrol and like there&rsquo;s always like this phase and the second you bought them every single toy</p>
<p>You can buy then they&rsquo;re not interested. Oh, no, isn&rsquo;t that such an analogy for life?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how adults are too, isn&rsquo;t it? When you get everything and all those get them you don&rsquo;t want it anymore</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m like today. I had a situation we were</p>
<p>You know, I was thinking about like what to do was that I had my son home from school today</p>
<p>so I had the two children and um, and</p>
<p>I decided cuz he he still loves trains even though he doesn&rsquo;t necessarily like that show</p>
<p>but um</p>
<p>I decided that we would just ride the train just like one stop and get off and</p>
<p>then like go to like a toy store and I would get him a little something and</p>
<p>So we did that and he only wants one thing and I didn&rsquo;t think that the store we were going to would have that thing</p>
<p>But I figured okay, I&rsquo;ll get him something else. So we like take the train like, you know, we do the whole walk</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s really excited for whatever whatever toy it&rsquo;s gonna be and then we get there and it had closed ten minutes ago</p>
<p>No, no poor thing. Oh, did he throw a tantrum? Did he freak out?</p>
<p>He got very upset because he wanted that toy, but again, I don&rsquo;t think that that toy was going to be there</p>
<p>So I you know, I had to it&rsquo;s interesting to like try and talk him through</p>
<p>Yeah a disappointment like I tried to teach him the word disappointed and then oh</p>
<p>And like, you know, I like said like oh you&rsquo;re feel and then I was like, so what you&rsquo;re feeling it&rsquo;s disappointed</p>
<p>I was like, do you want to say that do you want to try saying I&rsquo;m disappointed? He&rsquo;s like now</p>
<p>Disappointed he doesn&rsquo;t want to hear about it. Yeah. Yeah</p>
<p>Anyway, but the whole but my whole point is um</p>
<p>When he does get into something I want to get into it, too</p>
<p>Like I was telling you we&rsquo;re gonna be Paw Patrol for Halloween</p>
<p>Yeah, wait like with with Thomas like I learned all the songs I may like, you know, I want to</p>
<p>And I really feel that when I do that it really like makes him feel closer to me</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s like oh like we share the same interest even though like yeah</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a kid and I&rsquo;m the mom so like I don&rsquo;t know it just so it could be the books like I&rsquo;ll read him the books</p>
<p>About Paw Patrol like all sorts of things like and do I necessarily care about it myself?</p>
<p>No, not like I know the characters I know about it like so I&rsquo;m able to like have like this like I&rsquo;m realizing that there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Positive impact like me just like actually like genuinely enjoying what he enjoys or caring about it</p>
<p>Even though like I just said, I don&rsquo;t not really but like he thinks</p>
<p>So but this got me thinking about relationship and relationships in general</p>
<p>Like not just with kids and I often have students asking me about making friends and we have to think about this philosophy</p>
<p>And again, I don&rsquo;t want you to think that oh that I&rsquo;m like making it sound like children. It&rsquo;s not it&rsquo;s not bad</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just something from my life that I realized like can apply to everyone really. Um</p>
<p>Like so let&rsquo;s say everyone at your office watches a certain show</p>
<p>Right. Yes. Yes, you can be a bystander you can listen to it</p>
<p>But if you don&rsquo;t watch that show and like become a fan, you know, then you won&rsquo;t share that, right? Oh</p>
<p>Oh</p>
<p>Man, this makes me think of football in my extended family. Oh, oh, no. Does this mean I have to become a football fan?</p>
<p>I think you have to stay true to yourself</p>
<p>but I do think like</p>
<p>especially in the situation of I think a lot about like the office like being at an office if you know like you&rsquo;re working on</p>
<p>Your English you want to make friends? I really think that like just to ask questions about the show like</p>
<p>Yeah, don&rsquo;t force yourself. Don&rsquo;t force yourself</p>
<p>But I also think like pick up one of the things that they&rsquo;re talking about right like yeah</p>
<p>Yeah, like and then see because then you will start to have things in common. So like just just try it</p>
<p>You know, yeah, and it&rsquo;s just more fun</p>
<p>Like sometimes I&rsquo;ll be you know out in Denver and a game just lets out and I see these people and they&rsquo;re so into the game</p>
<p>Right, they&rsquo;re so into the fact that their team won or they&rsquo;re sad like they&rsquo;re super invested</p>
<p>And I wonder what would that be like to be that big of a sports fan, you know?</p>
<p>You really get into it and then you&rsquo;re fully living in the moment</p>
<p>You really care about what happens in that game and then you can connect with the people at work that really cared about that game</p>
<p>Right. Absolutely. Absolutely. So I really I don&rsquo;t know when I thought about this</p>
<p>I very specifically was thinking like of an office setting because I just think that that&rsquo;s like a place where you want to you know</p>
<p>Really jump in and and so I guess my point is just like have an open mind. Yeah</p>
<p>And you know, if there&rsquo;s one show that they talk about all the time like try it out</p>
<p>Try it out, you know, you know, it&rsquo;s just going to bring about more opportunities for connection</p>
<p>so if you necessarily</p>
<p>you know if you&rsquo;re like sitting in the lunchroom and like people are always talking about something and then you&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>Oh, I don&rsquo;t sure like I&rsquo;m happy to ask questions about it or just to listen actually watch it like go for it</p>
<p>You know, yeah, it kind of it feels awful to be and it kind of feels a lot</p>
<p>Like what happens when we don&rsquo;t speak a language that we&rsquo;re always talking about how to avoid that situation where we feel disconnected</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m imagining in the office lunchroom. It&rsquo;s the same thing</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s always a moment with my mother-in-law my father-in-law</p>
<p>Everyone in that side of the family when they go into football</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s ten minutes and I just literally like I tune out I just look around the room and then they come out of it</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>Think God it passes</p>
<p>But it is a moment of disconnection of being totally disconnected from these people around us</p>
<p>So we want you guys to feel that connection at the office, right?</p>
<p>So you do yeah, it&rsquo;s like you kind of just like glaze over</p>
<p>Like wait, you know, maybe look at your phone a little bit, right?</p>
<p>So it is this like again you I mean, yeah, I I have this with sports a lot too, actually, but I mean I</p>
<p>Think that again don&rsquo;t force yourself and it&rsquo;s not saying do something that you&rsquo;re not interested in</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need to become a huge football fan, you know</p>
<p>But if there are little things that you can do it if you are really, you know</p>
<p>Trying to form these connections and you know that that&rsquo;s a way to do it is to just like actually</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of like the fake it till you make it idea. Yeah, and you can also enjoy</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just thinking going with the football analogy</p>
<p>Maybe you don&rsquo;t get into the nuances of why this team traded that person which is what I hear all the time all the trades</p>
<p>Although I don&rsquo;t know, but maybe I can enjoy going to a game eating like a bratwurst</p>
<p>Drinking a beer or just sitting in the living room eating popcorn with my family, right?</p>
<p>I can enjoy that part of it, you know, so there is something to it. So Michelle</p>
<p>What could our listeners do in terms of vocabulary to get into it get into these things that TV show or that game?</p>
<p>Whatever it is. Sure. Well, I mean the first thing is to ask questions, you know, like oh, what channel is it on?</p>
<p>Or what&rsquo;s it about? Yeah, that&rsquo;s a huge what&rsquo;s it about? Um, yeah, but then when you watch right?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s something you could say? Yeah, you could say I started watching or reading or listening to blank</p>
<p>All right. So for example, I started watching Breaking Bad</p>
<p>I never watched Breaking Bad, but a lot of people did so I was cut out of a lot of conversations</p>
<p>You never did. What was the one about the the teacher that was like cooking up cocaine? Is that that? Okay, that is</p>
<p>Right exactly like I mean I&rsquo;ve been you know in those situations where you&rsquo;re kind of like yeah</p>
<p>Yeah, so take that take that moment and do something about it, you know, like actually say, okay</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna I&rsquo;m gonna actually give it a try</p>
<p>Yeah, the one that I did just start watching since I think since we&rsquo;ve been recording together Michelle is</p>
<p>Handmaid&rsquo;s Tale. Oh my god, that one is</p>
<p>Louise it&rsquo;s so intense. We had to take a break from it just because it is so intense</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s good, but it&rsquo;s too much too much to handle. Yeah, I just realized today that I&rsquo;m not watching any specific shows Wow</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a first, right?</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s a while like I don&rsquo;t have a series that I&rsquo;m watching</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just like last night like, um, you know the movie My Cousin Vinny. Yeah, of course. That is so good. Actually</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so good. It&rsquo;s so good. I think we watched that once in an ESL class</p>
<p>I was teaching in New York actually because of the New York accent</p>
<p>Right. It&rsquo;s a New York family. Yeah</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s it like I mean I&rsquo;ve seen it so many times and it was a great last night</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, I was just watching it and I was laughing out loud. Like it is so good</p>
<p>It is still funny like anyway</p>

<p>All right. So what else Michelle? What else do our listeners need in terms of vocab to take this to the next level?</p>
<p>All right. So another thing you could say is guess what? I&rsquo;m on episode blank of blank</p>
<p>So for example, guess what? I&rsquo;m on episode 4 of Game of Thrones. That&rsquo;s another one. I did not watch. Did you watch that?</p>
<p>No, I never got into Game of Thrones. No, I just I&rsquo;m just not gonna be able to catch up now</p>
<p>Or you could say are you caught up on?</p>
<p>On Handmaid&rsquo;s Tale, for example, are you caught up on? This is us. That&rsquo;s one that you and I have watched in the past, right?</p>
<p>This is us</p>
<p>And like people will be excited then like yeah, like that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m saying</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s a difference between being like, oh, yeah</p>
<p>like</p>
<p>Yeah</p>
<p>like tell me about this show and then if you watch it and then because if somebody really loves it and then you get into it</p>
<p>Then it&rsquo;s like oh you are like what&rsquo;s going on?</p>
<p>Like what&rsquo;s like what&rsquo;s going on that episode again? Like you haven&rsquo;t heard the pet, you know, like then it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>Oh, yeah</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like you delve into a whole new world that wasn&rsquo;t there before like a whole new set of things you can talk about with</p>
<p>The person and again guys</p>
<p>Relationships are built not necessarily. Well, you&rsquo;re discussing the business</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sort of around the business right during the lunchtime around that small talk and socializing</p>
<p>A lot of you guys have told us you need skills for being social at work. This is it, right? Absolutely</p>
<p>Yeah, so another thing would be just like what did you think of X?</p>
<p>like what did you think of SNL Saturday Night Live like that so it doesn&rsquo;t have to be always like a</p>
<p>Series that you know, it can be just like a variety special type thing. Sure</p>
<p>Is there anything we should avoid here Michelle when we&rsquo;re bringing this up? We&rsquo;re asking people about these things these shows. Mm-hmm, right?</p>
<p>I think avoid being insincere right like don&rsquo;t just say something to fit in, you know</p>
<p>like try it but it&rsquo;s also like if you don&rsquo;t like it like if I like if I</p>
<p>Tried to watch Game of Thrones to fit in with people. I don&rsquo;t think it would work, right? Like yeah, I feel the same way</p>
<p>or the football thing like you you want to be true to yourself because then people can kind of</p>
<p>Like then it then it&rsquo;s weird, right? Because then yeah, that would be weird</p>
<p>Then it feels like oh, you&rsquo;re just like doing it</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s like feels like you&rsquo;re happy like if you&rsquo;re doing like avoid doing everything the other people do like you don&rsquo;t all of a sudden</p>
<p>Have to copy everything or watch everything. Yeah</p>
<p>Yeah, try and choose one thing and have an open mind to it because maybe you will like it</p>
<p>But if you don&rsquo;t like it, that&rsquo;s fine, too completely. Yeah, I don&rsquo;t need to just know everything about football to connect with them</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s another topic that they have to themselves that I could get into right maybe football</p>
<p>I leave it for them and sometimes they feel kind of great that I can tune out for a minute to be honest</p>
<p>Exactly so don&rsquo;t lose yourself right Michelle don&rsquo;t lose yourself</p>
<p>I would say like, you know, try and make it a goal that you know to get into one new thing you hear</p>
<p>Other people talking about especially if it&rsquo;s something they&rsquo;re gonna talk about every week, you know, try it out like but again</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t I mean like if it&rsquo;s not for you like that?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just gonna it&rsquo;s just not gonna people will be able to tell and like oh really like seems like she&rsquo;s just watching it</p>
<p>To you know, like that&rsquo;s weird. That&rsquo;s weird. Yeah, don&rsquo;t lose yourself. I love it</p>
<p>Should we do a role play for our listeners?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s do it. All right, so I&rsquo;m who&rsquo;s new at work. You&rsquo;re new at work. Oh, I guess I am. Yes, I guess I meant</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re new at work Michelle and I am going to tell you that I love a show called pumpkins</p>
<p>Okay. All right. Here we go. All right. Here we go. All right. Guess what Lindsay? I&rsquo;m on episode 3 of pumpkins</p>
<p>Oh, wow, you started watching awesome. What do you think? Oh, it&rsquo;s great. Are you caught up? Yes, I&rsquo;ve watched so many</p>
<p>Are you caught up? Yes, I&rsquo;ve watched season 2. I can&rsquo;t wait for you to get to episode 12. It&rsquo;s incredible</p>
<p>What did you think of the twist at the end of the first episode? I was shocked</p>
<p>See, yeah, so it becomes more fun that connection now a lot more fun, you know</p>
<p>I mean in some ways in a perfect world, we would just connect naturally with everyone</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t we didn&rsquo;t wouldn&rsquo;t have to have a TV show or a piece of media. That&rsquo;s not reality, right?</p>
<p>Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Exactly. Exactly. People like to talk about the shows that they do they do</p>
<p>So, what did we say here? Let&rsquo;s see</p>
<p>We said first you said I&rsquo;m on episode 3, right?</p>
<p>Pumpkins, that&rsquo;s what that&rsquo;s just the show. I thought to me. I don&rsquo;t know what it&rsquo;s about</p>
<p>But uh, oh it makes me think of the show ghost ghosts. Have you seen ghosts? No, it&rsquo;s cool. It&rsquo;s fun</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just half an hour and it&rsquo;s a great one. Anyways, go check it out. And then we can talk about it Michelle</p>
<p>And then you said what do you think so but and then this is a good one are you caught up</p>
<p>What does that mean? Hmm? Have you seen it all the way until the end?</p>
<p>Like have you seen the lat most recent episode? Are you caught up?</p>
<p>Exactly. Exactly</p>
<p>And then you got all excited</p>
<p>And then yeah, I mean, it&rsquo;s not necessarily using okay, like we didn&rsquo;t use all the expressions here, right?</p>
<p>I wanted to give an example of how it works</p>
<p>Yeah, but you did say at the end you said what did you think of the twist, right?</p>
<p>We taught our listeners that what did you think of X something that happened right now?</p>
<p>You have more to talk about guys</p>
<p>This is how we avoid those kind of awkward moments where it feels like there&rsquo;s nothing to talk about at work</p>
<p>Okay. Yes, exactly</p>
<p>Those awkward silences. Yeah, so, you know try, you know, I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>I think just try and find the things that you might have in common and if you don&rsquo;t have something in common</p>
<p>Pick one thing that everyone&rsquo;s talking about try it out</p>
<p>See if it&rsquo;s for you if not move on see if there&rsquo;s another thing but you know that yeah</p>
<p>I think that it&rsquo;s just a good idea like and it just leads me back to what I was saying about my son is like</p>
<p>I have like you have to you know, if I show genuine interest it brings a lot more to our</p>
<p>Relationship and you have more fun too. So that&rsquo;s the key guys</p>
<p>So this really is bit even though you know, we we started the episode talking about kids and family and everything</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s business English for the modern professional, right?</p>
<p>Cuz right we watch TV our co-workers watch TV we connect on different around different media different things happening</p>
<p>This is business English right here guys. So good stuff, Michelle good stuff</p>
<p>All right. All right. Well, this was fun and</p>
<p>Lindsay I guess we&rsquo;re not gonna be watching football anytime soon. No, I&rsquo;m not getting into that. Nope not gonna happen</p>
<p>All right, Michelle. Take care</p>
