    <p>One, two, three, one, two, three, remember, you have to do it, that&rsquo;s next, okay, I have</p>
<p>a system, one, two, three, send her to fucking Hollywood, how about Las Vegas, I could have</p>
<p>my own show, a clapper show, I could clap and wear pasties, you could, hey, what, what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on, pumps, what have you had it with this week, you know, I&rsquo;ve just been so tickled</p>
<p>pink with my life this week, that&rsquo;s off topic, what am I, as you can see from our television,</p>
<p>the name of our podcast is, I&rsquo;ve had it, so allow me to cover, why don&rsquo;t you do it, for</p>
<p>us yet again, okay, let me tell you what I&rsquo;ve had it with, I&rsquo;ve had it with yak mouths</p>
<p>sitting near you at a sporting event, 1 million percent agree, it&rsquo;s ridiculous, so recently</p>
<p>Josh and I went to London to see Roger Federer play doubles with Rafa Nadal and Roger Federer&rsquo;s</p>
<p>last professional tennis match of his iconic, legendary tennis career, so we&rsquo;re sitting</p>
<p>there at the O2 arena in London, packed house, these yak mouth Americans are sitting behind</p>
<p>us from North Carolina, of course, they were American, and this guy has to narrate everything,</p>
<p>he has to talk nonstop, and he&rsquo;s not like when Josh and I would talk, we would lean</p>
<p>and whisper, because I had awareness about the people around me and about their feelings</p>
<p>and that they had paid a lot of money and traveled a long way, but these fuckers sitting</p>
<p>behind me from North Carolina did not, the match ends and then all of a sudden it&rsquo;s this</p>
<p>amazing ceremony where Roger starts bawling, Rafa is completely a basket case, he&rsquo;s bawling,</p>
<p>Josh Welch is snot slinging, ugly cry bawling, and I can&rsquo;t enjoy any of it hardly because</p>
<p>of these goddamn yak mouths sitting behind me.</p>
<p>Nothing worse than a yak mouth.</p>
<p>Just a nonstop horrible content narration, and I mean I&rsquo;m just furious about it, and</p>
<p>I just, I don&rsquo;t understand why people don&rsquo;t take into account the feelings of those around</p>
<p>them.</p>
<p>The only thing I will say is, is there any chance, because you know I&rsquo;m a horribly loud</p>
<p>talker, and so when I think I&rsquo;m not-</p>
<p>You think you&rsquo;re an offender?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;m an offender, there&rsquo;s no doubt about it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a part of the problem.</p>
<p>Yeah, but I wouldn&rsquo;t do it in a deal like that, but I just wonder if they didn&rsquo;t realize</p>
<p>how loud they were, because I don&rsquo;t realize how loud I am.</p>
<p>I have like camera being pulled out of a film right now, thinking back to going to movies</p>
<p>with you and doing things with you, and I think you are a part of the problem.</p>
<p>I am.</p>
<p>I think though, it&rsquo;s because I just don&rsquo;t understand how loud I am.</p>
<p>I hate to one-up you on that story, but at Luke&rsquo;s football game, if he doesn&rsquo;t return</p>
<p>the kick and let, he fair catches, people will bitch about, why didn&rsquo;t you, Luke, you</p>
<p>should have gotten that ball, da-da-da-da-da, and I&rsquo;m like, his fucking mother is sitting</p>
<p>right here.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;ve seen some of the ugliest behavior of humanity pertaining to children&rsquo;s sports,</p>
<p>and then just the delusions that these parents have, a kid that&rsquo;s, you know, nowhere near</p>
<p>has the physique of a D1 athlete, because you would know by looking 100%.</p>
<p>This brings me to something that I don&rsquo;t know if this is, this is a topic I&rsquo;m just going</p>
<p>to say that I&rsquo;ve totally kind of had it with.</p>
<p>It can be fun, but when people take it too seriously, it&rsquo;s incredibly annoying, and it</p>
<p>is just, number one, astrological signs, and number two, everybody on Instagram talking</p>
<p>about Mercury being in retrograde.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even know what that means.</p>
<p>A lot of people I follow on Instagram are like, oh my God, my life&rsquo;s a mess this week.</p>
<p>I forgot to return an email.</p>
<p>I lost my keys.</p>
<p>I forgot to feed my dog.</p>
<p>So I Google it.</p>
<p>What does Mercury in retrograde mean?</p>
<p>Because I&rsquo;d never fucking heard of it, right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard the term.</p>
<p>What do you think Mercury in retrograde is?</p>
<p>Just an excuse for bad behavior, it sounds like.</p>
<p>But what do you, what do you think Mercury is?</p>
<p>Okay, Mercury is a planet.</p>
<p>Do you know what Mercury is?</p>
<p>Nailed it.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s, I don&rsquo;t know what retrograde means in terms of planets.</p>
<p>Basically, it&rsquo;s an optical illusion.</p>
<p>So all the planets circle around the sun, and when Mercury is in retrograde, it appears</p>
<p>from the Earth&rsquo;s vantage point that it stops moving, but it actually doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an optical illusion.</p>
<p>So basically fucking nothing happens.</p>
<p>Nothing is happening differently.</p>
<p>Nothing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a Leo.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And I just hit the Google.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m going to go through positive traits and negative traits of Leos.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;ll tell you if you have them.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to, yeah, we&rsquo;re both going to say, and then we&rsquo;re going to go through yours.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Positive traits of Leos.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Enthusiastic.</p>
<p>50-50.</p>

<p>Childish.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>100%.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re childish at all.</p>
<p>Look at what we&rsquo;re doing right now.</p>
<p>Overbearing.</p>
<p>100%.</p>
<p>Stubborn.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>For sure.</p>
<p>Status-seeking.</p>
<p>Totally.</p>
<p>Autocratic.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You want to be the boss.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll take it.</p>
<p>Arrogant.</p>
<p>Afraid so.</p>
<p>Cocky.</p>
<p>Probably.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>100%.</p>
<p>Dominating.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So actually, this is pretty good anecdotal evidence.</p>
<p>Pretty spot on.</p>
<p>I am spot on for a Leo.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s kind of weird.</p>
<p>Shit.</p>

<p>Egalitarian.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>A hundred percent.</p>
<p>I need a definition on that.</p>
<p>What do you think it is?</p>
<p>I have no idea.</p>
<p>Like ruled by ego, maybe?</p>
<p>Egalitarian.</p>
<p>Shirley, you&rsquo;ve, you&rsquo;ve been to law school for the last time.</p>
<p>No, I know.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard the word, but I&rsquo;m not.</p>
<p>How did you pass the bar exam?</p>
<p>Oh, you didn&rsquo;t the first time, did you?</p>
<p>No, I didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>It was a two-timer.</p>
<p>Two-timer.</p>
<p>We could add petty to yours, Jennifer.</p>
<p>And I will wear it with a badge of honor.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Negative traits.</p>
<p>Eccentric.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Unpredictable.</p>
<p>You know what&rsquo;s going to happen before I do.</p>
<p>Emotionally detached.</p>
<p>One hundred ten percent.</p>
<p>Fucking put it in the bank.</p>
<p>Start charging interest.</p>
<p>Nailed it.</p>
<p>Aquarius.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>Negative traits.</p>
<p>Emotionally detached.</p>
<p>Ding, ding, ding.</p>
<p>Calculating.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Contradictory.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Resilient.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Restless.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Chaotic.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>One thousand percent.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So, I mean, I&rsquo;m spot on.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re spot on.</p>
<p>But I think I have heard that since I&rsquo;m one day before the switch, like I&rsquo;m on the cusp.</p>
<p>Oh, for fuck&rsquo;s sake.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve just heard that saying.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re on the cusp.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just the biggest bunch of bullshit.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve just heard it.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;m promoting it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just saying I&rsquo;ve heard it.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at this from a statistical standpoint.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I did used to read when they had newspapers.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So, you probably read Dear Abby, too, didn&rsquo;t you?</p>
<p>I did.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Anyway, think about statistically how it would have to go down for everybody that&rsquo;s ever</p>
<p>been born on February 18th from the beginning of our species until now to all have the same</p>
<p>character traits.</p>
<p>No, I know.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying I wholeheartedly believe it, but I&rsquo;m just saying it&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>I find it interesting.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So, it&rsquo;s rumored that J-Lo has fired backup dancers strictly on their astrological signs.</p>
<p>Apparently, she doesn&rsquo;t get along with Virgos, a star sign shared by her ex-husband, Mark</p>
<p>Anthony.</p>
<p>She asked all the dancers to raise their hands if they&rsquo;re Virgos.</p>
<p>She looked at them and said, thanks so much for coming, and let them all go.</p>
<p>Some people have cited Virgos as being highly uncoachable.</p>
<p>I will say, if you&rsquo;re J-Lo, you can do whatever the fuck you want.</p>
<p>Some people do or don&rsquo;t date or marry others based on their signs.</p>
<p>Some people turn down renter&rsquo;s applications and quit their jobs because of horoscopes.</p>
<p>Also known as astrology discrimination, something that apparently, again, we keep hitting this</p>
<p>theme, you guys, no oversight.</p>
<p>And then we also have Zodiac shaming.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even know what that is, refresh, refresh me.</p>
<p>What part do you don&rsquo;t know?</p>
<p>What Zodiac shaming?</p>
<p>Is that, is Zodiac horoscope, is that the same?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what that is.</p>
<p>Should we, the Zodiac killer I know was a killer based on Zodiac signs, but is our Zodiac</p>
<p>and horoscope signs the same?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So Zodiac shaming, people are like, could shame you like, oh God, he&rsquo;s just a Pisces.</p>
<p>What a fucking asshole.</p>
<p>All Pisces are assholes.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;ve heard that before.</p>
<p>Like, well, we broke up because he&rsquo;s a Gemini or whatever.</p>
<p>And then some people use their Zodiac or their astrological sign to justify naughty behavior.</p>
<p>Like people could blame their sex addiction on their sign.</p>
<p>People could blame cheating on their sign.</p>
<p>What are the signs for that?</p>
<p>I mean, the sex addiction sign.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to have a guest soon, but we&rsquo;re going to ask her.</p>
<p>Falling out with friends, emails getting lost, and people, again, people actually blame their</p>
<p>flights being delayed on Mercury in retrograde.</p>
<p>I think to say where the stars were when you were born could help you justify your behavior</p>
<p>or cause you to miss flights or you didn&rsquo;t feed your dog.</p>
<p>I think maybe people need to come to grips with maybe they&rsquo;re just kind of fucked up.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I tend to agree.</p>
<p>I also think that you just have to be accountable.</p>
<p>Like I fucked up, I didn&rsquo;t feed my dog, has nothing to do with my sign, but I still think</p>
<p>you can have fun with it.</p>
<p>I do think you can.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s fun.</p>
<p>We have in the past when we&rsquo;ve gone on girls trips, we&rsquo;ve had our tarot cards read.</p>
<p>I fucking love it.</p>
<p>And it was totally fun.</p>
<p>Have I told you this before?</p>
<p>Before I got married, I was in New Orleans with my ex-husband and I got my tarot cards</p>
<p>read and so did he.</p>
<p>We both did, together, like one right after the other.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re standing there.</p>
<p>Are you serious?</p>
<p>And I got, I can&rsquo;t remember the card, but it was like I got a black mark for love, like</p>
<p>run, basically was the card.</p>
<p>And we were together.</p>
<p>And guess what?</p>
<p>My life would have been so much easier.</p>
<p>And you ran right into him.</p>
<p>I should have run though.</p>
<p>If I would have just listened to that.</p>
<p>To the tarot card.</p>
<p>To the tarot card.</p>
<p>No, thank you.</p>
<p>Well, I think we need to dig deeper into this and we have a guest today and she has a podcast</p>
<p>called Invasion of Privacy and her name is Kate and she is a tarot card reader, a comedian.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been cooking, trying to be more of a housewife.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard, especially when you look up recipes online.</p>
<p>Have you guys tried to do this recently?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s everyone wanting to be a blog writer.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a fucking recipe, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s their feelings about the fucking meal.</p>
<p>I look up how to make apple crisp.</p>
<p>You click on it and it&rsquo;s a woman being like, when I think of apple crisp, I think of the</p>
<p>orchard I was walking in 10 years ago with my lover, rubbing his back hair with my fingers</p>
<p>as the apple squished below us.</p>
<p>Now preheat your oven to 400 degrees.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like, whoa, I was masturbating.</p>
<p>I thought, I forgot we were cooking.</p>
<p>This is going to be a ton of fun.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s welcome Kate.</p>
<p>Hi Kate.</p>
<p>Hi Kate.</p>
<p>Hi.</p>
<p>Oh, I love it.</p>
<p>How are you?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m good.</p>
<p>How are you?</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m Jennifer and this is Angie.</p>
<p>Hello.</p>
<p>Her nickname is Pumps.</p>
<p>So if you hear me switch from Angie to Pumps, but we want to thank you for joining us today</p>
<p>and we have been talking a little bit before you came on about our signs.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a Leo and Pumps is an Aquarius.</p>
<p>And we did a quick little Google search of positive Leo traits and negatively traits.</p>
<p>I pretty much had all of them.</p>
<p>She was like 98% and I&rsquo;m the biggest naysayer about astrological signs.</p>
<p>You know, I do fully believe in astrology.</p>
<p>You believe in it.</p>
<p>You think that has a factor on who we are and why we are the way we are.</p>
<p>Yes, but I also think that we&rsquo;re all so unique that it&rsquo;s hard at the same time to try to</p>
<p>put us into categories with it, but I do think it&rsquo;s usually accurate and there&rsquo;s a science</p>
<p>to it.</p>
<p>So, and I&rsquo;m very out there, you know, I like it.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s an aerial or sign traits, fiery, stubborn.</p>
<p>And I am very fiery.</p>
<p>I may not seem it right now.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done a lot of work.</p>
<p>I love it to calm the fire, you know, I mean, I can just something can just set me off and</p>
<p>I am just like, Oh my God.</p>
<p>And you really just have to learning how to manage, you know, the emotions that run amok</p>
<p>inside of us is truly one of the longterm life things that you never quite nail.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re in the right place because you&rsquo;ve just hit your amongst friends on this deal.</p>
<p>I always have to tell myself like, nobody gives a shit, but you like, why are you holding</p>
<p>everybody hostage on something that really doesn&rsquo;t fucking matter to anyone, but you</p>
<p>and it has nothing to do with anybody else, right.</p>
<p>You know, and that&rsquo;s a hard one because especially when you&rsquo;re a single parent, you think everything,</p>
<p>you know, you&rsquo;re the authority, blah, blah, blah, blah, right, right.</p>
<p>And I think boundaries are huge and a lot of us are finally learning how to set positive</p>
<p>boundaries.</p>
<p>I have no boundaries, like it is a character defect.</p>
<p>No boundaries.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so hard.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not taught it in our society.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re learning because that self love is learning how to say no.</p>
<p>So you can replenish and feed yourself and not living out of obligation, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really hard.</p>
<p>You know, we can, why don&rsquo;t you share with her some of your lack of boundaries, things</p>
<p>that you have a hard time drawing a boundary with.</p>
<p>See if she has any insight.</p>
<p>I mean, the ones like, I totally will pee with the door open.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care who&rsquo;s in there.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not modest.</p>
<p>At my office where there&rsquo;s men here as well.</p>
<p>She just goes and sits down and pees in a, in a, in a, in a, I&rsquo;m an interior designer</p>
<p>and my interior design firm and Javier who works at front desk walks by.</p>
<p>He cannot see me on the bathroom.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never done it when he was like, I shut when he&rsquo;s here.</p>
<p>No, I know.</p>
<p>But he wasn&rsquo;t like around.</p>
<p>I did it with Nellie because sometimes I think you have to talk when you&rsquo;re on the potty</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re in a hurry.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So go on.</p>
<p>Oh gosh.</p>
<p>Um, I have a horrible time.</p>
<p>Like I just avoid getting into a conversation with someone versus having to set the boundary</p>
<p>like, okay, I&rsquo;ve heard enough.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;d rather just avoid the whole thing than, than like my eyes start rolling back</p>
<p>in my head instead of just saying, okay, that&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>Tell her about the, um, the group me you&rsquo;re in for your 22 year old son.</p>
<p>Oh, this.</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t even know if this is, do you have kids?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I have a 16 year old boy.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So I have a 20, 22 year old son and he&rsquo;s at college and his fraternity, the moms all have</p>
<p>a group me like needing to know stuff.</p>
<p>Like what&rsquo;s the update on where they&rsquo;re living?</p>
<p>What do you have to buy for where they&rsquo;re living?</p>
<p>Do they have freezers?</p>
<p>You know, all that shit.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m on the group me and Jennifer is just like, cannot wrap her head around it because</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s not a minor.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s 22 years old.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I think what I would do if I were in the group me, all the parents would see is Jennifer</p>
<p>has left this group.</p>
<p>I want to talk about the tarot cards that you do.</p>
<p>I love tarot cards.</p>
<p>It can say right here.</p>
<p>Oh my gosh.</p>
<p>Can you do it?</p>
<p>The reading.</p>
<p>Oh, me first.</p>
<p>Me first.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Do pumps first.</p>
<p>Do pumps.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m going to do three cards to start.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And then if we want to go deeper, I can pull more.</p>
<p>So you got three really powerful major arcana cards.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re reversed, which means there&rsquo;s some resistance of your power.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ll get into it.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Tell me what resistance of my power means first.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got to put my glasses.</p>
<p>So, okay.</p>
<p>So this is the Empress.</p>
<p>Can you see it?</p>
<p>Oh my God.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m an Empress.</p>
<p>So the Empress is all about art and femininity.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s saying sometimes we get so stuck in what we need to create and produce and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not doing enough instead of remembering that you&rsquo;re the art and boundaries actually</p>
<p>come into this because when you&rsquo;re allowed to say no to the things that are pulling on</p>
<p>you in a way that doesn&rsquo;t feel good, remember to feed yourself as the art.</p>
<p>As the masterpiece.</p>
<p>I love that.</p>
<p>The only time I feel like art is when I go get Botox or filler and I know I&rsquo;m the art</p>
<p>then.</p>
<p>But I mean, that&rsquo;s growth for me though.</p>
<p>Growing into my femininity.</p>
<p>If I can.</p>
<p>Move over.</p>
<p>Move over, Mona Lisa.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s get to your next card though.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Um, King of Cups reversed.</p>
<p>So for King of Cups with the masculine coming through, it&rsquo;s very like CEO energy of you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t care what people think of you as much because you&rsquo;re running your stuff.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t need to worry as much of, do they like me?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s learning how to ride the emotions that we were talking about.</p>
<p>And then we have King of Swords reversed and you are a powerful truth speaker.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re meant to get to an even deeper place of what your truth is.</p>
<p>Maybe sharing more of your vulnerabilities, your limitations, but not being scared to</p>
<p>really speak your truth.</p>
<p>You ready for your tarot reading now?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So I, these are fun.</p>
<p>So the first one, the Hermit reversed the Hermit.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re kind of a Hermit.</p>
<p>And this Hermit card looks a little scarier than most Hermit cards, but this is saying</p>
<p>it is good to go within.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you have some introverted ways, but it&rsquo;s saying, it&rsquo;s saying this is</p>
<p>a good thing.</p>
<p>You often need space to reflect on what&rsquo;s going on and just to reach your, your anchor,</p>
<p>your center.</p>
<p>Do you ever meditate?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;re, the card is spot on in the sense that I, I&rsquo;m extroverted, but when I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>off or my desire is to be alone, right.</p>
<p>And specifically, I love my kids, but I have to have my time with my dogs, but they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>my constant companions.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll get to the next card because it&rsquo;s linked to it.</p>
<p>The star reversed.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>This is about getting into your intuition and your deepest truth, that guidance of who</p>
<p>you truly are.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s this deep push.</p>
<p>And I believe you&rsquo;re definitely being supported by the other side.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how much you believe in that kind of stuff, but it&rsquo;s, thank you for your</p>
<p>honesty.</p>
<p>I just, I just, I don&rsquo;t, I think an extraordinary claim requires extraordinary evidence.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a very reality based person.</p>
<p>And I believe in the moments we have now carry the biggest amount of value for me,</p>
<p>the known that is the most spiritual for me, or these moments talking to you right now,</p>
<p>being with her moments with my dogs, with my children, that the known is the, the one</p>
<p>thing that&rsquo;s tangible that I can embrace more spiritually than the unknown.</p>
<p>Well amen to that.</p>
<p>But I do believe that there is more evidence that&rsquo;s coming out each month.</p>
<p>I mean, I was talking about enlightened aliens for years, people thinking I&rsquo;m crazy talking</p>
<p>about it on stage and then the Pentagon finally released, yes.</p>
<p>You know?</p>
<p>So I think.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s some shit, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the shit I want to know.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s the shit.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s the shit we need to know.</p>
<p>Seems like the Pentagon and the Navy.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s pretty extraordinary.</p>
<p>Have some extraordinary evidence.</p>
<p>You talk about meditation, if I were to sit and invite feelings in, I would just be like,</p>
<p>Oh my God, this is so dumb.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>I appreciate people that can do it and that, but I just, it&rsquo;s not who I am.</p>
<p>I would be inauthentic to who I am.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m always.</p>
<p>I think listening to yourself is beautiful.</p>
<p>You know, what&rsquo;s right for you and that&rsquo;s the star card too, is you&rsquo;re the only one</p>
<p>who knows your inner truth.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s next?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I get the sense that if there&rsquo;s a party situation and there&rsquo;s a creepy person in the room, you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to spot it.</p>
<p>Oh, she will spot them out immediately.</p>
<p>She wouldn&rsquo;t be at the party.</p>
<p>She wouldn&rsquo;t be at the party because she&rsquo;d be in hermit.</p>
<p>But if she was at the party, she would immediately find the nut jobs.</p>
<p>I do that, but I marry the nut jobs.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what my&hellip;</p>
<p>I did too.</p>
<p>Touche.</p>
<p>Okay, go on.</p>
<p>Well, love and romance is the quickest way to, it reflects our deepest wounds that are</p>
<p>often hidden.</p>
<p>It does.</p>
<p>So we find ourselves in situations that are reflecting parts of ourselves that we haven&rsquo;t</p>
<p>seen or don&rsquo;t understand yet.</p>
<p>So all right, last card.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Eight of pentacles.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>This is about continuing the hard work.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s acknowledging how hard you work and it&rsquo;s saying you are strong.</p>
<p>Keep going.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re building something pretty deep and I don&rsquo;t think everyone maybe knows the depth</p>
<p>of your mission will say and what you want to bring in, but this is saying keep going.</p>
<p>Write this down.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t know the depths of my mission.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re really creating something and you have this vision to shift things in a certain way.</p>
<p>And I just want to say, keep going.</p>
<p>Is there a professional ethical code for tarot cards?</p>
<p>Because you never hear someone say you&rsquo;re going to die tomorrow.</p>
<p>Like if something really terrible is going to happen, do you not say it?</p>
<p>Do you not?</p>
<p>Do you just ignore it?</p>
<p>You know, one time I knew a woman was getting cheated on in the cards and it was her bachelorette</p>
<p>party and that was a tough one.</p>
<p>That was a real tough one.</p>
<p>Did you tell her?</p>
<p>Wait, wait, wait.</p>
<p>So many questions.</p>
<p>So you lay this gal&rsquo;s cards out and you can surmise from the cards that he&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>cheat on her at his bachelor party.</p>
<p>She got the three of swords and it&rsquo;s like three swords going through a heart.</p>
<p>And it means heartbreak that needs to be processed or may, might be around the corner.</p>
<p>We joke around that if there was an island and it had the, the, each of our baby daddies</p>
<p>on it with red flags and physical red flags all around it in sharks circling it, we would</p>
<p>strip down and swim as fast as we could to the red flags.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>We would have popped out children immediately, immediately.</p>
<p>Right there.</p>
<p>Caution to the wind.</p>
<p>That, that was how fucking crazy.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not saying we&rsquo;ve got it together right now, Kate, because, but it&rsquo;s better, but that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>how fucking crazy we were in our twenties.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve had evolved a little bit, a little bit, but yeah, no, it&rsquo;s as bad as it gets</p>
<p>in the red flag department over here.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just going to tell you for sure.</p>
<p>I think astrology is, is bullshit.</p>
<p>One thousand percent.</p>
<p>If astrology makes you happy and reading your horoscope makes you happy.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>I do get irritated about people blaming and excusing bad behavior.</p>
<p>My thing is if it, if it works for you with the stuff, with the beings, and then for some</p>
<p>people it&rsquo;s Christianity, for some people it&rsquo;s Buddhism.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>For me, it just, it doesn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>And you never know.</p>
<p>Also what could happen.</p>
<p>I hope.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s exactly right.</p>
<p>In a week I could reach out and be like.</p>
<p>A bean could be tapping on my shoulder and I&rsquo;m going to be like, Kate, here&rsquo;s the deal.</p>
<p>Never say never.</p>
<p>When we open our podcast, we talk about what we&rsquo;ve had it with this week.</p>
<p>And the one thing I&rsquo;ve had it with is I went to watch a tennis match and these fuckers</p>
<p>from North Carolina are sitting behind me and they&rsquo;re just yak mouse nonstop.</p>
<p>As you perform comedy, do you have yak mouse, you know, while you&rsquo;re full blown in a comedy</p>
<p>routine and people are just talking?</p>
<p>Sometimes I&rsquo;m pretty good at shutting down hecklers in that situation.</p>
<p>I have the mic.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll call it out.</p>
<p>Oh, good for you.</p>
<p>Like, what do you say?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pretty good at making them regret that.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t usually happen with me.</p>
<p>Also with my psychic abilities on stage, if I try not to use them while I have a mic.</p>
<p>It could be a weird twist, but if I need to and someone&rsquo;s messing with me, I can tune</p>
<p>right into the other side in that moment because I&rsquo;m triggered and say their biggest wound</p>
<p>or embarrassment.</p>
<p>So I usually can shut that down.</p>
<p>If someone&rsquo;s disrespecting me, I&rsquo;m put in a place where I now can feel into your wound</p>
<p>for whatever reason.</p>
<p>And I will, I want to say the thing that will hurt the person the most.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re disrespecting me and I have a mic, I&rsquo;m supposed to be getting attention</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re going to disrespect me.</p>
<p>It brings out my rage and then I&rsquo;m somehow able to tune in through my rage.</p>
<p>Because if someone&rsquo;s being that disrespectful, they&rsquo;re showing their colors.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>You know, I feel like there are instances where people really show who they are.</p>
<p>And if they&rsquo;re doing that and they&rsquo;re with a girl that they&rsquo;re trying to impress, oh,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re done.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to tell that girl to never let your penis in her vagina or the vagina of approval</p>
<p>on it.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>You know, even if she does, she&rsquo;s going to remember me saying like, he&rsquo;s not the one</p>
<p>right.</p>
<p>Move on.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll pick a new guy in the audience.</p>
<p>So I usually, you know, in that kind of pressure cooker, um, can, can win those situations.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>Well, Kate, thank you so much for the tarot card reading.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Oh, you&rsquo;re welcome.</p>
<p>And you know, if I ever get a tap, tap, tap or anything crazy, I&rsquo;m going to call you aliens</p>
<p>in your backyard.</p>
<p>I need, I need to hear.</p>
<p>No, you will be my very first phone call.</p>
<p>Thank you so much.</p>
<p>Kate.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re fascinating.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s such a precious person.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So fun meeting you both.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>Thanks so much.</p>
<p>Bye.</p>
<p>Bye.</p>
<p>Bye.</p>
<p>She was just so cute.</p>
<p>That was really fun.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve noticed a theme that&rsquo;s starting to take hold and take shape in these podcasts.</p>
<p>So it starts off with some grievance that we have.</p>
<p>Totally.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve noticed that we&rsquo;ve had it with, we&rsquo;re fucking assholes about it, that, you know,</p>
<p>the national holiday, and then fall in love with it, astrology.</p>
<p>Then we scout it out.</p>
<p>We want to get to the bottom of it.</p>
<p>And then we meet the people, we confront the grievance, and then we evolve.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Growth is happening on this podcast.</p>
<p>But I will say, and you can put it on my fucking tombstone, Mercury in retrograde is bullshit.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll take that down.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Despite me almost scoring 100% on my Leo personality chart, I still think that&rsquo;s bullshit.</p>
<p>However, her stuff with tarot cards and her positivity and kind of like channeling her</p>
<p>energy, I&rsquo;m totally in on.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s super cool.</p>
<p>I do too.</p>
<p>She believes that she can help people.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s awesome.</p>
<p>I do too.</p>
<p>No, she was great.</p>
<p>We have.</p>
<p>We have like totally flipped.</p>
<p>Like on almost everything.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of like, we&rsquo;re not- As smart as we think we are?</p>
<p>Well, a hundred percent, that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>Also like we&rsquo;ve had it and then- We get it.</p>
<p>We get it.</p>
<p>One question.</p>
<p>What about the Burning Man episode?</p>
<p>Did you guys?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Put it on my tombstone.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m never going to ever, ever, ever, ever get.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just not possible.</p>
<p>She boycotted Burning Man and she thinks mercury in retrograde is a flaming pile of horseshit.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>When are we going to see people?</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>When are we going to see people?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Oh my God.</p>
<p>You guys.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s just not quite steady.</p>
<p>What are we talking about?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m teeing you up.</p>
<p>When are we going to see people?</p>
<p>Like dead people?</p>
<p>Oh my God.</p>
<p>Oh my God.</p>
<p>My ears hurt.</p>
<p>Hurry.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so sorry.</p>
<p>See you next Tuesday.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not even going to say it.</p>
<p>I know you&rsquo;re mad.</p>
<p>How despite.</p>
<p>I did not know what we were doing.</p>
<p>Sorry.</p>
<p>I teed it up.</p>
<p>I know, but I&rsquo;m thinking about how bad my ears hurt.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the slowest goddamn word in our past.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just not.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m terrible.</p>
<p>Take off your fucking headphones then.</p>
<p>The podcast is over.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Take off your headphones.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
