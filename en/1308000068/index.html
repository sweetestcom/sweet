    <p>We had a nice dinner.</p>
<p>Chamath hosted a little</p>
<p>and we played a little bit of the cards</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s this new kid there.</p>
<p>Oh, big shout out to</p>
<p>co-founder is there.</p>
<p>Great guy.</p>
<p>How do you wind up here at the game</p>
<p>sitting here, you know,</p>
<p>having a beautiful dinner with us?</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, well,</p>
<p>and then Chamath goes.</p>
<p>And he points to Helmuth.</p>
<p>Helmuth found a billionaire.</p>
<p>When Helmuth finds a billionaire,</p>
<p>what happens?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s tied to the hip.</p>
<p>He has like a billionaire.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a billionaire wrangler.</p>
<p>Helmuth is like one of those truffle dogs</p>
<p>in like, you know, Alba in Italy.</p>
<p>You know, you send them out into the woods.</p>
<p>He forages around.</p>
<p>He finds he finds a truffle,</p>
<p>just digs it out.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, and then he follows like a dog.</p>
<p>He follows tail wagging, tail wagging,</p>
<p>waiting for his owner to show up</p>
<p>and pick this little billionaire off the ground.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s another one.</p>
<p>Look, daddy.</p>
<p>See, I found another billionaire.</p>
<p>Helmuth is the most insecure person,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s such a beautiful human being.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s a great human.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s like the tale of two people.</p>
<p>He really is a walking case</p>
<p>of schizophrenia and narcissism.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s Chamath saying that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going.</p>
<p>Hey, everybody.</p>
<p>Hey, everybody.</p>
<p>Welcome to another episode of the All In podcast</p>
<p>with us again, the new chairman</p>
<p>and majority shareholder of Laura Piana,</p>
<p>Chamath Palihapitiya,</p>
<p>and the Viceroy of Veganism.</p>
<p>Do you like my thin cashmere gilet that I&rsquo;m wearing?</p>
<p>Gilet?</p>
<p>Do you mean polo?</p>
<p>No, gilet.</p>
<p>Gilet.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Magnifique.</p>
<p>Also with us, the Viceroy of Veganism.</p>
<p>The Sultan of Science.</p>
<p>David Freitberg.</p>
<p>And the regent of the right wing.</p>
<p>David Sachs.</p>
<p>The Viceroy of Vegans.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>Viceroy of Vegans.</p>
<p>It came to me in the shower today.</p>
<p>I was like, you know what?</p>
<p>He needs a new one.</p>
<p>I switched my background, guys.</p>
<p>Do you like it?</p>
<p>I just flipped the camera to look the other way,</p>
<p>just to mix it up a little bit.</p>
<p>Now we can see your chef</p>
<p>picking the vegetables in your garden.</p>
<p>Well, yeah.</p>
<p>Before you used to see him pick the herbs.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>The herbs are on this side,</p>
<p>but now you can see him pick the veggies.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Oh, there&rsquo;s the sous chef.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the prep chef.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s that chef.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Everybody showed up today.</p>
<p>Okay, great.</p>
<p>You know, you seem to enjoy the food, Jason,</p>
<p>every time you come.</p>
<p>You talk all the shit.</p>
<p>But you are always eating when you&rsquo;re at my house.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re always eating.</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s the first RSVP after Phil Haslam?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s eating.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s sending his notes to the kitchen.</p>
<p>Could you just do this a little differently?</p>
<p>I do give notes.</p>
<p>I do, I do.</p>
<p>Usually positive ones.</p>
<p>Three out of four are positive notes.</p>
<p>You know, when I flew with Chamath a few weeks ago,</p>
<p>the chef made gluten-free Nutella crepes with homemade Nutella.</p>
<p>I mean, it was like the most extraordinary breakfast experience.</p>
<p>That Nutella has no sugar.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s incredible.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s basically all protein, fat,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s sweetened with monk flour sugar.</p>
<p>So delicious.</p>
<p>That Nutella.</p>
<p>They also kill some albino seals.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve not brought a chef on the plane with me,</p>
<p>but I think in fairness,</p>
<p>your kitchen&rsquo;s bigger.</p>
<p>Well, your plane&rsquo;s not that big.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;ve got a small plane.</p>
<p>I have the kitchen.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if a Cessna 142 can finish it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m feeling plane shamed.</p>
<p>I just got to business select on Southwest,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m feeling pretty good about myself right now.</p>
<p>All right, everybody, let&rsquo;s get started.</p>
<p>A lot of topics people want to talk about.</p>
<p>Do you want to start with Rogan or the Canadian truckers?</p>
<p>I think Rogan probably leads into the truckers, no?</p>
<p>It might, in fact, lead into the truckers.</p>
<p>Okay, so we covered Rogan and Spotify in Episode 66 a whole bunch.</p>
<p>Since that time, a video surfaced on Saturday</p>
<p>with Joe Rogan repeatedly saying,</p>
<p>well, the N word, and it&rsquo;s pretty rough to watch.</p>
<p>And he did a mea culpa, an apology.</p>
<p>And overall, now Spotify has taken down 70 episodes of his podcast.</p>
<p>You know, that&rsquo;s out of over 1,000.</p>
<p>I thought it was like 113.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I saw on Twitter.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s 113 total.</p>
<p>Maybe 70 had the N word, but 113 total.</p>
<p>Oh, okay, yes, you&rsquo;re correct.</p>
<p>I stand corrected.</p>
<p>110 have been taken down.</p>
<p>I was texting with Sox.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like almost 6% of all of his episodes they took down.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Something like that.</p>
<p>Yeah, but not all of them were because of that language.</p>
<p>No, that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m saying, but 6% were taken down.</p>
<p>6% taken down.</p>
<p>In his apology, he said, obviously, he was wrong to use that word for the decade or so,</p>
<p>but he pointed out that he did not use it towards a person as a slur,</p>
<p>but was talking about it more in studying or discussing the N word.</p>
<p>Use versus mention, is that right?</p>
<p>Is that the distinction?</p>
<p>Yeah, or use versus quoting.</p>
<p>Yeah, so he said it was taken out of context, apologized.</p>
<p>He also made a joke that he immediately said,</p>
<p>oh my God, that&rsquo;s pretty racist.</p>
<p>I shouldn&rsquo;t have told that joke, where he compared going to see</p>
<p>Planet of the Apes in an all-black theater in Philly, saying he was in Africa.</p>
<p>On Sunday, Daniel X sent a memo to Spotify employees</p>
<p>claiming he is not the publisher of the Joe Rogan show.</p>
<p>Something I completely dispute.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll talk about that in a moment.</p>
<p>Thoughts on the latest brouhaha, and do we think that Spotify will be able to handle</p>
<p>this, what seems to have died down over the last couple of days,</p>
<p>and Rogan is now joking about it in his comedy engagements at small comedy clubs.</p>
<p>What do you think, Sax?</p>
<p>Is Joe Rogan going to weather the storm?</p>
<p>Is Spotify going to stick with him?</p>
<p>Well, okay, so as of the last episode of the All In pod,</p>
<p>they were trying to cancel Rogan for misinformation, and for the reasons we discussed,</p>
<p>that basically failed because so many of the times something starts as misinformation,</p>
<p>eventually becomes the truth.</p>
<p>Rogan seemed like a guy who actually just wants to present both sides,</p>
<p>present a balanced viewpoint.</p>
<p>In any event, that whole attempt to cancel him based on misinformation was fizzling out,</p>
<p>and then lo and behold, this 22-second clip comes out, and they escalate the charges to racism.</p>
<p>If you look at who&rsquo;s behind this clip, it&rsquo;s pretty clear that it was a Democratic super PAC,</p>
<p>put this together, and astroturfed it as a viral video.</p>
<p>This is part of an organized attempt to cancel Rogan.</p>
<p>Now, as to the merits of the racism accusation against him, let me say that I don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>anybody, especially a public figure, should be using this kind of language in this day and age.</p>
<p>Even if you&rsquo;re just quoting something or mentioning it, he should have known better.</p>
<p>However, there are also similar clips that are now circulating of Joe Biden doing the same thing,</p>
<p>using this type of incredibly incendiary language in a brazen, almost off-handed way.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got clips of Howard Stern-</p>
<p>Hold on a second.</p>
<p>Wait, wait.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re saying brazen, and he said it exactly the same way as Joe did, which is-</p>
<p>I would say maybe in a cavalier way.</p>
<p>But let me come back.</p>
<p>You have Biden doing it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got Howard Stern doing it.</p>
<p>What is the difference?</p>
<p>The reality here is that we used to, in our culture, have a distinction between</p>
<p>the use of this type of language as an epithet, which was never okay.</p>
<p>Or using it, you were referencing it.</p>
<p>You might have been quoting it.</p>
<p>You might have been quoting a rap song.</p>
<p>You might have been quoting a Dave Chappelle routine.</p>
<p>You might be reading from a book.</p>
<p>You might have been telling a story in which somebody else has said it,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re merely trying to relay what happened.</p>
<p>The rules today are, that&rsquo;s not an excuse.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t say it.</p>
<p>But the truth is that 10 years ago, 20 years ago, the rules were a little different.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why Biden said it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why Howard Stern has these episodes.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s why Rogan had said it.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s a little bit disingenuous for people to now try and apply the new rules</p>
<p>to this old language.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re doing it very selectively because they&rsquo;re not trying to cancel</p>
<p>these other people who&rsquo;ve said these things under the old rules.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re trying to cancel Rogan.</p>
<p>So I think what you&rsquo;re seeing here is selective cancellation outrage,</p>
<p>selective application of these new language rules for the purpose of getting Rogan canceled.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>For the same reasons we were talking about two weeks ago or last week,</p>
<p>which is he&rsquo;s an outsider.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s an independent voice.</p>
<p>He bucks the establishment.</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t present the orthodox view on COVID.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s frankly why they want to cancel him.</p>
<p>Friedberg.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just looking at the Howard Stern quote.</p>
<p>So in 1993, Howard Stern dressed in blackface and used the N word in a skit he did,</p>
<p>mimicking Ted Danson, talking about Whoopi Goldberg, something.</p>
<p>And he said, I&rsquo;ll be the first to admit, I won&rsquo;t go back and watch those old shows.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, who is that guy?</p>
<p>But that was my shtick.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s what I did.</p>
<p>And I own it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I got embraced by Nazi groups and hate groups.</p>
<p>They seem to think I was against them too.</p>
<p>So I think, you know, Saks is probably right.</p>
<p>I mean, Howard Stern is a very different character today.</p>
<p>You know, I think the question of if Howard Stern acted that way today,</p>
<p>would cancel culture kind of mob him?</p>
<p>The answer is probably yes.</p>
<p>But I think it&rsquo;s because, you know, Rogan is out here probably picking a bone with everyone.</p>
<p>You know, he&rsquo;s kind of&hellip;</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no alignment.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no&hellip;</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no tribal behavior with Rogan, right?</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t&hellip; He&rsquo;s been pretty public about being very liberal.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s been very public about being conservative in some ways.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think he kind of aligns himself strongly with anyone.</p>
<p>And so he&rsquo;s a threat to everyone.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s got a huge following.</p>
<p>And, you know, he speaks openly and honestly, in a way that is threatening.</p>
<p>Certainly, his behavior was inexcusable and has been inexcusable.</p>
<p>But there are others, right?</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s an important question, which is why him?</p>
<p>Why now?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also interesting with that Ted Danson.</p>
<p>He was dating Whoopi Goldberg at the time, I believe.</p>
<p>And Ted Danson was&hellip;</p>
<p>There was a roast of Whoopi Goldberg at the Friars Club.</p>
<p>Ted Danson dressed in blackface, I think, which Whoopi Goldberg was in on.</p>
<p>Oh, Ted Danson dressed in&hellip;</p>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t Howard dress&hellip;</p>
<p>And then Howard did a send up of that.</p>
<p>Anyway, the point is the more&hellip;</p>
<p>The standard has changed significantly.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s let Chamath chime in.</p>
<p>My book of the year, last year, was this book Wanting by this author, Luke Burgess.</p>
<p>He wrote something on Substack.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll send you guys a link, you can put it in here.</p>
<p>But he said the following.</p>
<p>He said, as we regress to a superstitious, quasi-pagan world of witch burning,</p>
<p>civil discourse will be replaced with superstition and scapegoating.</p>
<p>And he was talking about Rogan.</p>
<p>I think that the thing that I was the most proud of in this whole thing was Daniel Eck.</p>
<p>I mean, disclosure, he&rsquo;s a friend of mine, so maybe this is biased.</p>
<p>However, I think that Spotify had business principles.</p>
<p>And this was similar to what Brian Armstrong did at Coinbase.</p>
<p>I think they stuck to those principles.</p>
<p>They made a well-reasoned decision that they explained to their employees and shareholders.</p>
<p>And then they did the most important thing that Sachs has always been saying around free speech,</p>
<p>which is more speech.</p>
<p>And so what Spotify said when they explained the decision to not de-platform Joe Rogan</p>
<p>was that they would take the exact equivalent economic value of what they were paying them,</p>
<p>him, $100 million, and invest it in historically underrepresented groups</p>
<p>to tell their stories, to make their music, etc.</p>
<p>And so effectively doubling the universe of that kind of content.</p>
<p>And so I think if people are really willing to listen,</p>
<p>I think what we should take away from this is here&rsquo;s a really clear-eyed example</p>
<p>of the solution to free speech, which is just to get more of it on your platform,</p>
<p>to have the right disclosures and disclaimers.</p>
<p>And then for, you know, people to go along with their lives so that they can then choose.</p>
<p>And I think that that&rsquo;s that was the that was the one positive outcome that</p>
<p>that I saw from this entire episode.</p>
<p>The rest of it was another attempt at, you know, being morally absolutist and,</p>
<p>you know, scapegoating.</p>
<p>And then the that was before, obviously, the the n-word thing.</p>
<p>And then the n-word thing just brought to light that we live in a very different age</p>
<p>where the rules have changed.</p>
<p>And I think the open question is, you know, if you&rsquo;re going to judge people for past behaviors</p>
<p>on current rules, are we allowed to do it selectively?</p>
<p>Or does it apply to everybody?</p>
<p>And I and I think that, you know, this is why I think, you know,</p>
<p>this is why I think, you know, we saw people like David Simon,</p>
<p>you know, came out and David Simon was very,</p>
<p>you know, basically excoriated Joe Rogan.</p>
<p>But then David Simon wrote The Wire, you know, and if you if you watch The Wire,</p>
<p>which is, you know, an incredible piece of television that people point to all the time</p>
<p>is one of probably the greatest shows on television.</p>
<p>You know, every probably, you know, 13th or 14th word was the n-word.</p>
<p>Yeah, I have like two observations here.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;ll get to you, Saxon, if you have something you want to chime in on.</p>
<p>I always like to think about intent.</p>
<p>And then I like to look at the apology and think, is this like sincere or not?</p>
<p>And when you look at the intent, does anybody actually think Joe Rogan is a racist?</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s pretty clear he&rsquo;s not from all of the behavior collectively in his life.</p>
<p>And then you look at the apology.</p>
<p>I thought I felt it was incredibly sincere.</p>
<p>And there were many learning moments in it.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s a comedian, which is kind of this other space where we we ask comedians to make</p>
<p>us laugh and make us feel uncomfortable.</p>
<p>And now we&rsquo;re also asking them to live by a standard that changes every year and words</p>
<p>come on and off the allowable list.</p>
<p>Would anybody here, does anybody here actually think or anybody listening to me think Joe</p>
<p>Rogan is actually racist?</p>
<p>I think the answer is I don&rsquo;t think anybody thinks that.</p>
<p>And then number two, I felt the apology was incredibly thoughtful and well done.</p>
<p>Sax, what are your thoughts?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, I agree.</p>
<p>I agree with those things.</p>
<p>Nobody was accusing Joe Rogan of racism until the cancellation mob started throwing stones</p>
<p>and the misinformation stones didn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>So then they escalated to racism.</p>
<p>I think the generalized thing, just take the context out of Rogan for a second.</p>
<p>I think that the the formula, if I can point to this, of cancel culture is now, I think,</p>
<p>pretty well understood, which is if you don&rsquo;t like somebody, you need to throw some ism</p>
<p>label on them until that ism label sticks.</p>
<p>And eventually you will find an ism label.</p>
<p>But the the thing that this cancel culture doesn&rsquo;t appreciate is everybody has some ism</p>
<p>that that can be attached to them.</p>
<p>Now, some isms are worse than others, obviously.</p>
<p>But, you know, we&rsquo;re all infallible.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I go back to like, if you want to quote the Bible, right, there&rsquo;s a there&rsquo;s a beautiful</p>
<p>passage into the Bible, the book of John and the whole thing.</p>
<p>And you guys have heard this quote many times before.</p>
<p>But let me just give you the setup.</p>
<p>So in the law of the land back then, adultery was illegal, but only for the woman.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s a very famous example of a woman who is accused of adultery.</p>
<p>And, you know, she was about to be stoned to death, which was essentially the punishment.</p>
<p>And Jesus basically draws a line and says, you know, he who is without sin should cast</p>
<p>that first stone.</p>
<p>And nobody does.</p>
<p>It deescalates that conflict and everybody leaves.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a very famous essay that Renee Girard wrote that basically compared that</p>
<p>to a different example in a more paganist context where people did stone people.</p>
<p>The idea of all of this is that there&rsquo;s some amount of.</p>
<p>You know, sin that everybody carries.</p>
<p>And I think that at some point.</p>
<p>Cancel culture will realize that.</p>
<p>You have to deescalate and you have to see through some of this noise.</p>
<p>You have to have some point of moral resolution to really move on.</p>
<p>Because this sort of like fatalistic judgment doesn&rsquo;t work anymore.</p>
<p>So whoever people wanted to cancel Rogan, they must be very frustrated today because</p>
<p>for all intents and purposes, he got off the hook.</p>
<p>They may try again in the future with some other ism.</p>
<p>He may just as well get off the hook in the future.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So what what is the real solution?</p>
<p>The real solution is to figure out how to deescalate and actually have a conversation</p>
<p>about the things that he&rsquo;s doing that really upset you.</p>
<p>And that is still not what&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>And a path perhaps to resolution.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s get Freeberg in and then you sex Freeberg.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll say two things.</p>
<p>One, I think I once sat next to Tony Blair for dinner.</p>
<p>You know, he was the prime minister of the UK.</p>
<p>And he told me it was a really funny conversation because he was talking about his youth.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, if there were iPhones when I was young, I would not have ever been elected</p>
<p>to public office.</p>
<p>Like, you know, he was in a rock band.</p>
<p>He I don&rsquo;t know if you guys know his history, but, you know, he was pretty freewheeling</p>
<p>kind of guy.</p>
<p>And his point was really broader than that.</p>
<p>It was that, you know, all of us have something that people can look to us for and use against</p>
<p>us in some way.</p>
<p>But I think what&rsquo;s really important with this Joe Rogan thing, and I think the bigger picture</p>
<p>for me, dissenting voices and critical voices and outspoken voices are extremely important</p>
<p>in the discourse that makes society progress.</p>
<p>It is not a good society.</p>
<p>When people that have dissenting of voices or offensive voices are shut down, society</p>
<p>has a better opportunity to chart a new course and to identify new pads, sometimes when the</p>
<p>dissenting voice is wrong, and sometimes when it is right.</p>
<p>But in both cases, it is important to have that dissenting voice because it allows us</p>
<p>to have the dialogue that allows us collectively to figure out what is wrong, and what is right.</p>
<p>And so this notion of cancel culture and the way that people like Joe Rogan are and have</p>
<p>been attacked for things that they have said in the past or do say today, I think is really</p>
<p>contrary to the opportunity that the United States presents with this, you know, founding</p>
<p>principle of freedom of speech.</p>
<p>Yeah, so I agree with that.</p>
<p>I want to build on what Chamath said with the Rene Girard analysis of this.</p>
<p>I mean, what we&rsquo;re seeing here is the modern day equivalent of a primitive, you know, archaic</p>
<p>stoning ritual.</p>
<p>This is a modern day virtual stoning, in which we&rsquo;re not killing somebody, but we&rsquo;re trying</p>
<p>to kill their digital avatar.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re basically trying to remove and destroy their online presence.</p>
<p>I mean, that was really the goal here.</p>
<p>And in the mechanics of this thing, it only works to the extent that people are unaware</p>
<p>of the mechanism of the scapegoating.</p>
<p>As soon as they become aware that this person&rsquo;s being targeted selectively as a scapegoat,</p>
<p>it stops working.</p>
<p>And that was the situation we were in last week, where you had, you know, Neil Young</p>
<p>cast the first stone, despite being guilty of misinformation.</p>
<p>Many times himself, he&rsquo;s got like a weird history of saying weird things about GMOs</p>
<p>and gay people, and some of the stuff got dredged back up.</p>
<p>And I think that was fair, because let he who is without misinformation cast his first</p>
<p>stone.</p>
<p>And then he got some of his friends, you know, these aging, you know, rockers like Joni Mitchell</p>
<p>and Crosby, Stills, and Nash to throw the next stones.</p>
<p>And then the media got in on this, and CNN and MSNBC, they were throwing stones.</p>
<p>And it was all motivated by the fact that Rogan simply does not refuse, he refuses to</p>
<p>parrot their orthodoxy because, you know, we can see people like Howard Stern, who I</p>
<p>like Stern, okay?</p>
<p>But today, Howard Stern has become a full-fledged COVID hysteric.</p>
<p>I mean, he is fully on board with the COVID restrictions and mandates in this area.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why he gets diplomatic immunity to this.</p>
<p>So, the whole scapegoating ritual around Rogan was about to fail last week.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why they escalated it, is because they saw, first of all, Rogan was getting</p>
<p>away.</p>
<p>And then second, our ability to run these sorts of like witch hunts, if people start</p>
<p>to reject that, we lose all of our power.</p>
<p>And so, that&rsquo;s why this thing escalated into the most sensitive area that we have in our</p>
<p>society, this language around race, this very hurtful, these hurtful epithets.</p>
<p>And these people are playing games with that, with that type of language.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s very destructive.</p>
<p>And, but I think people are seeing through it, you know,</p>
<p>I really agree with this.</p>
<p>I think like the scapegoating has a way to resolve things is losing its effectiveness</p>
<p>increasingly.</p>
<p>It did work online for some amount of time early on.</p>
<p>And David, you&rsquo;re exactly right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s when the mechanism of action was poorly understood.</p>
<p>But now that everybody sees it, and people try to do it all the time, it just stops working.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not nearly as effective anymore.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a burnt out tactic.</p>
<p>You know, we see this and it&rsquo;s like, this marketing channel has been overburdened.</p>
<p>Everybody knows like, okay, I&rsquo;m being marketed to and to give it some context for those people</p>
<p>who are wondering, you heard Rene Girard like three or four times here.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a philosopher.</p>
<p>And he taught at Stanford.</p>
<p>He had a big impact on Peter Thiel.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if Sachs actually took any courses with him.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a book.</p>
<p>Me, Peter, David.</p>
<p>I mean, like, if you take courses with him,</p>
<p>I never took any courses.</p>
<p>But Peter told me about his ideas in college.</p>
<p>I read some of his books.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>His books are incredible.</p>
<p>I mean, he is one of the most powerful thinkers of this.</p>
<p>I mean, he&rsquo;s he passed away.</p>
<p>Reminds me of Joseph Campbell, the power of meth.</p>
<p>Like they were really thinking about the sort of basic tenets of like human,</p>
<p>the human condition and how people behave.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really worth double clicking on.</p>
<p>I think also interesting in terms of forgiveness and blackface.</p>
<p>Justin Trudeau has appeared no less than three times in his youth in blackface.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not a joke.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s literally true.</p>
<p>Justin Trudeau, like the reason why the the racism label was planted on</p>
<p>Rogan is because he&rsquo;s heterodox.</p>
<p>The reason why that racism label has not yet really been planted on Justin Trudeau</p>
<p>is because he&rsquo;s orthodox.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s quite he&rsquo;s quite part of the ingrained establishment.</p>
<p>He comes from royalty in Canada growing up pure Trudeau.</p>
<p>You know, we were we were liberals growing up.</p>
<p>We were members of the Liberal Party.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;d made donations to the Liberal Party.</p>
<p>You know, in our lore, there is no greater symbol than pure Trudeau, his father.</p>
<p>And so when you&rsquo;re the son of somebody like that, you get an enormous amount of</p>
<p>credit in your bank account that you&rsquo;re born with.</p>
<p>And he was able to burn through so much of it by doing things that anybody else</p>
<p>in any other situation may have been judged much more harshly for.</p>
<p>And he wasn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And he becomes prime minister.</p>
<p>And then he&rsquo;s able to get reelected.</p>
<p>But, you know, his day of reckoning is that reckoning is coming because he is revealing</p>
<p>himself to be a part of this establishment with these views that are actually really</p>
<p>uncomfortable and, you know, quite grotesque because of how judgmental they are of everybody</p>
<p>else.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a great segue.</p>
<p>And then just finally, Saxe, correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong here.</p>
<p>Joe Rogan has voted Democrat his whole life.</p>
<p>He holds largely Democratic beliefs.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s for universal health care.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s pro-trans.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s pro-gay.</p>
<p>He supported Bernie Sanders.</p>
<p>And he was voting for Bernie Sanders.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a really stupid person for the Democrats, for Democratic politicians like Biden to alienate</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s a hero to young people.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a hero to the working class.</p>
<p>And his views are fundamentally, I&rsquo;d say, more progressive.</p>
<p>Yeah, they&rsquo;re 100% progressive.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s stupid for them to do this.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s also stupid for them to be alienating these truckers because Democrats were supposed</p>
<p>to be the party of the working class.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s pivot to that issue.</p>
<p>Can I just say one last thing?</p>
<p>I just want to reiterate this, Saxe, because I just I just want to really give you a chance</p>
<p>to say it again.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve always said, and it&rsquo;s so true, the solution to free speech and to protect it</p>
<p>is more speech.</p>
<p>And I just want to say to Daniel Ack and the team at Spotify, you guys must have been in</p>
<p>a really difficult spot.</p>
<p>But the decision to take that $100 million to increase the funnel for other voices and</p>
<p>historically underrepresented voices is so good.</p>
<p>And I hope you guys get to the other side of it.</p>
<p>But I thought it was a really, really, really good decision.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, so on Ack and the Spotify decision, let me say one thing to that.</p>
<p>So I applaud them for not canceling Rogan.</p>
<p>They must have been under enormous pressure to do so, including from their own employees.</p>
<p>The only thing I didn&rsquo;t like in Ack&rsquo;s statement was when he talked about the user safety and</p>
<p>how they need to do a better job of user safety.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a concept that doesn&rsquo;t make a lot of sense to me.</p>
<p>I mean, Rogan is not sneaking into people&rsquo;s living rooms and turning his show on and pressing</p>
<p>play.</p>
<p>If people don&rsquo;t like it, I&rsquo;m talking about users.</p>
<p>If users don&rsquo;t like the content, they don&rsquo;t have to listen.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to click play.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not threatening anyone&rsquo;s safety.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;ve still bought into this idea of psychological safety that being confronted</p>
<p>with any view you don&rsquo;t like is a threat to your safety.</p>
<p>That is actually a threat to free speech, because it&rsquo;s giving the most hysterical people</p>
<p>in our culture, the ones who are most prone to being offended, a veto over any idea and</p>
<p>speech they don&rsquo;t like.</p>
<p>Yeah, if you&rsquo;re uncomfortable, you&rsquo;re unsafe, you could remove yourself from that situation</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s a piece of media.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need to read every book.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need to see every Quentin Tarantino film.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need to listen to Joe Rogan or whatever else that you find offensive to you personally.</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t think we should be feeding that idea that psychological safety is a legitimate</p>
<p>idea.</p>
<p>We talked about this before with people at work.</p>
<p>If they say they feel unsafe, that&rsquo;s instantly like an HR, like, oh my God, you feel unsafe?</p>
<p>Yeah, red alert.</p>
<p>HR comes running over because they have a legal requirement.</p>
<p>If someone&rsquo;s creating a safety issue in the workplace, they have a legal requirement to</p>
<p>remove that problem.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why this language got started is it triggers the machinery of HR to remove people</p>
<p>who are doing nothing wrong other than expressing a view you don&rsquo;t like.</p>
<p>Yeah, but if I told you as an employee, like, Saxon, hey, listen, your work product is not</p>
<p>good enough, you&rsquo;re like, I feel unsafe.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Anyway, let&rsquo;s go to the truckers because I think we&rsquo;re beating this to death.</p>
<p>I just want to have one final comment on Spotify.</p>
<p>I think, and I appreciate what Daniel did with $100 million.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s great that he&rsquo;s supporting free speech and he&rsquo;s holding his ground there.</p>
<p>I know that&rsquo;s not easy.</p>
<p>However, I think he&rsquo;s intellectually dishonest saying they&rsquo;re not the publisher of Joe Rogan.</p>
<p>I have a three-part test to see if you&rsquo;re a publisher.</p>
<p>Do you pay for the content?</p>
<p>Do you promote it?</p>
<p>Do you produce it?</p>
<p>If you do two or more of those, you&rsquo;re de facto a publisher in my mind.</p>
<p>They pay a lot of money for Joe Rogan.</p>
<p>They promote the heck out of him.</p>
<p>And while they don&rsquo;t produce it in advance by picking the guests, they do have a production</p>
<p>like veto on what content they put out there.</p>
<p>And so if Netflix has to own the people they pay, even if they don&rsquo;t produce it and they</p>
<p>promote, then Spotify does need to have the same standard and Disney and Netflix, all</p>
<p>are producers of content.</p>
<p>Nobody would argue that.</p>
<p>And I believe Spotify is the producer Daniel&rsquo;s not being honest on this.</p>
<p>Let me just defend Spotify for a second.</p>
<p>Okay, you guys have been through this.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been through this many times at several of my companies.</p>
<p>But when you are in the middle of a firestorm, it&rsquo;s very rare that you can put out these,</p>
<p>you know, press releases, where the pride of authorship is one person.</p>
<p>And in many ways, you have to write these PR releases, with all of these guardrails</p>
<p>that that think about all of these future issues that may pop up over time.</p>
<p>And so I understand that you guys had some issues with some of the words, I would just</p>
<p>say, again, look at the action.</p>
<p>And the action is, he didn&rsquo;t deplatform someone, and then he doubled down on free speech.</p>
<p>And he actually pointed $100 million firehose at people who can now tell their own stories</p>
<p>on a platform that is the most important audio platform in the world.</p>
<p>So I would say, you know, you know, that&rsquo;s kind of like same thing when I said, you know,</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t particularly like sometimes, you know, Brian&rsquo;s essay, I could have written</p>
<p>it better.</p>
<p>But at the end of the day, what I saw through it, and I admitted this later, the substance</p>
<p>of what Brian Armstrong did was incredibly profound, one of the most important things</p>
<p>that actually happened in the last few years in Silicon Valley culture.</p>
<p>And I would just say that I think that Daniel did something really powerful here.</p>
<p>And I think that both Spotify and Coinbase deserve and the employees and the leaders</p>
<p>there deserve a round of applause.</p>
<p>I think it was a very, very hard decision.</p>
<p>And I think they stuck to their guns, irrespective of what you believe they stuck to their guns,</p>
<p>Canadian truckers are protesting, as many of you know, vaccine mandates, just breaking</p>
<p>today, Ontario&rsquo;s premier has declared a state of emergency for the entire province.</p>
<p>And Ottawa police have braced for 1000s of protesters to descend for the third consecutive</p>
<p>weekend USA Today, also reported the convoy could disrupt the Super Bowl Biden State of</p>
<p>the Union, etc.</p>
<p>The protest has been self titled the freedom convoy and has been underway since January</p>
<p>29 29th.</p>
<p>It appears it has banned several 1000 vehicles across the country, and the truckers are blocking</p>
<p>key roadways and bridges, including the Ambassador Bridge.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re seeking an end to connect Canada&rsquo;s vaccine mandates.</p>
<p>And it feels like this is now morphing into something a little bit wider than just vaccine</p>
<p>mandates.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s becoming a Occupy Wall Street type of protest open to many people with many different</p>
<p>things that they have grievances about a reporter from Barry Weiss is common sense newsletter</p>
<p>slash media operation wrote what the truckers want.</p>
<p>Jason, you&rsquo;re you you just nailed it.</p>
<p>I do think that this is actually Occupy Wall Street 2.0.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Look, it turned out just to get roots and facts.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not just truckers.</p>
<p>This is a broad based coalition of people across every single race and gender and age</p>
<p>group in Canada that&rsquo;s participating in this thing.</p>
<p>In fact, the Barry Weiss article, you know, she profiled men, women of all ages, Sikhs,</p>
<p>you know, whites, I mean, everybody blacks, there was so there&rsquo;s a there&rsquo;s a coalition</p>
<p>of people.</p>
<p>Second is this really isn&rsquo;t about vaccination rates, because it turns out truckers are 90%</p>
<p>vaccinated, they&rsquo;re vaccinated at a higher percentage than the actual broad based population</p>
<p>of Canada, which is about 78%.</p>
<p>I think the point of this and again, I care about this so much as a Canadian, but I just</p>
<p>want to read a quote from Justin Trudeau, because I think it encapsulates what this</p>
<p>is really about.</p>
<p>The quote is the small fringe minority of people who are on their way to Ottawa, who</p>
<p>are holding unacceptable views that they are expressing do not represent the views of Canadians.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s that phrase unacceptable views that really points to what the real</p>
<p>issue here is, which is that there are a lot of people who now say it&rsquo;s been two years,</p>
<p>enough with mask mandates, enough with all of this, you know, almost police state that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>developed all of the emergency use power that politicians have taken, let&rsquo;s reclaim our</p>
<p>democracy and let&rsquo;s have, you know, freedom again.</p>
<p>And under the political viewpoint of the ruling Liberal Party, which by the way, is now going</p>
<p>into revolt as well.</p>
<p>A bunch of liberal MPs have just completely flipped because of this statement.</p>
<p>It summarizes what Trudeau is saying, which is what you believe is unacceptable to me.</p>
<p>And so now I will quash you or that Canada has one viewpoint.</p>
<p>Freeberg, did any of you guys listen to the New York Times daily podcast that our friend</p>
<p>sent out the link to this morning?</p>
<p>Yes, you know, to me, these are the same story.</p>
<p>It was actually an interview with a reporter who highlighted some work that she had done</p>
<p>and identified that Phil Murphy, the Democratic governor of New Jersey, had done some, some</p>
<p>polling and some some focus group discussions with some of his constituents.</p>
<p>And the overriding tone was one of emotion, one of feeling left out of the life that they</p>
<p>believe they should have been living over the past two years.</p>
<p>And ultimately, I think the tone speaks very clearly to what the truckers are saying, which</p>
<p>is everyone feels more than ever, incredible overreach into their personal lives by the</p>
<p>government, and by different governments, whether it&rsquo;s local or federal here in the</p>
<p>US or by this Canadian government, or, you know, go to Australia or the UK, and the sentiment</p>
<p>seems to be similar everywhere.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that any time since World War Two, have we seen the government create such</p>
<p>restrictions and such mandates in democratic republics, like the United States, that we</p>
<p>just saw over the past two years.</p>
<p>And I think the fact that it&rsquo;s continuing when folks are now seeing, you know, on the</p>
<p>ground every day, you know, the mildness of Omicron, or like, you know, the big, the challenges</p>
<p>that their kids are facing in school, and you kind of put these things together, and</p>
<p>you say to yourself, why is my government restricting my life and causing the challenge</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m being forced to face?</p>
<p>For what?</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s a tone that everyone feels everywhere in the West today.</p>
<p>I think in the East, it&rsquo;s a little bit different, right?</p>
<p>Because of the mindset there.</p>
<p>But I think here, collectivism, collectivism, and I think here, where we pride individual</p>
<p>liberty and freedom, as kind of the foundation of these democracies, to have the government</p>
<p>tell us what we have to wear shots, we have to put in our arms, where we can go and when</p>
<p>how we can behave in ways that were never legislated in ways that were never kind of</p>
<p>debated and discussed publicly, just feels overreaching.</p>
<p>At this point, I think everyone&rsquo;s hit their breaking point.</p>
<p>And this is another one of these examples, this trucking thing is another one of these</p>
<p>examples of people manifesting their breaking point.</p>
<p>And sacks to the point we&rsquo;ve been discussing over and over again, things have changed radically</p>
<p>since the beginning of the pandemic, you believed in mask mandates early, because hey, no downside,</p>
<p>we talked about that.</p>
<p>And we didn&rsquo;t want hospitals to be overrun, which is reasonable.</p>
<p>You wanted to have oxygen, we were all, you know, trying to make plans for, hey, how bad</p>
<p>is this going to be?</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;re sitting here two years later, and it&rsquo;s pretty clear Omicron, which I had, thank you,</p>
<p>sacks, is a nothing burger, as we said here.</p>
<p>Thanks, sacks.</p>
<p>Thanks a lot, sacks.</p>
<p>Saxicron.</p>
<p>I helped you.</p>
<p>Saxicron, maybe a superhero, thank you.</p>
<p>All I&rsquo;ve ever gotten is sick when I&rsquo;ve been around you.</p>
<p>Yeah, I went to sacks&rsquo; party and all I got was an $8,000 gift bag and Omicron.</p>
<p>The gift bag&rsquo;s pretty great at sacks&rsquo; parties.</p>
<p>I think getting Omicron helped you because it enabled you to see that this, for you,</p>
<p>was largely a nothing burger.</p>
<p>And so you could come out of your house and start acting normal.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a lot of people all over the country who are like that.</p>
<p>You were saying that?</p>
<p>You haven&rsquo;t left your house for two years.</p>
<p>Do you remember the photos of sacks at the beginning of COVID when he was wearing the</p>
<p>triple mask and the goggles?</p>
<p>Yeah, he was scared to death.</p>
<p>He ran to Mexico and built a fort.</p>
<p>He Colonel Kurtz did.</p>
<p>Well, look, I supported mask mandates at the beginning of the pandemic when Fauci was telling</p>
<p>us masks didn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s not forget that.</p>
<p>I was supporting when the health officials told us they didn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because it was the only thing we had.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t have vaccines.</p>
<p>David, come on.</p>
<p>He was doing us a favor by lying to us by his own admission.</p>
<p>He said, I lied to you so that we could preserve these masks for frontline workers.</p>
<p>Well, thank you.</p>
<p>Thank you, Anthony Fauci.</p>
<p>One of many noble lies that he&rsquo;s been telling.</p>
<p>Here we go.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a noble liar.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a noble liar.</p>
<p>By May of 2020, I was saying.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s my biggest political loser.</p>
<p>Pick from 2020.</p>
<p>Go on.</p>
<p>Take it easy on your picks.</p>
<p>I know you want to do your victory lap.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s only February.</p>
<p>Give us till like June for the check in.</p>
<p>OK, Colonel Kurtz, continue.</p>
<p>Masks were the main alternative to lockdowns.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the way I saw it in the summer of 2020.</p>
<p>And I was saying, end these crazy lockdowns, just do masks.</p>
<p>And then once we had the vaccine and all COVID restrictions, that was a year ago.</p>
<p>And now we still have these restrictions a year later.</p>
<p>And that is what the truckers are rebelling against.</p>
<p>Just like you said, these are ordinary people who are sick and tired of having to show</p>
<p>their papers and have to deal with these mandates.</p>
<p>And and for that, they&rsquo;ve been like absolutely demonized.</p>
<p>I mean, Trudeau comes out and says that they&rsquo;re basically white supremacists and racist and</p>
<p>homophobic.</p>
<p>Every epithet he can throw at them.</p>
<p>Sorry to your point.</p>
<p>He used every he did use every ism.</p>
<p>He really did try to cancel them at first.</p>
<p>And this is what&rsquo;s really painted him in a corner.</p>
<p>He went on national TV and he said, these people are racist and misogynist.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s specifically what he said.</p>
<p>And it actually turned out that the overwhelming majority of them were not they were just normal,</p>
<p>ordinary law abiding Canadians who are just fed up with the overreach.</p>
<p>And then then what happened was the polling said, you should bring these convoy leaders</p>
<p>in, sit them down and talk to them.</p>
<p>And then the political calculus, though, was impossible for him because he had already</p>
<p>called them racist and misogynist.</p>
<p>So then how could he bring them in?</p>
<p>Right, exactly.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>How do you negotiate with Nazis, basically?</p>
<p>So then what he did was he ran out of Ottawa.</p>
<p>So instead of staying in Ottawa, now he&rsquo;s under in a secure location for his sake.</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>Oh, he feels unsafe.</p>
<p>So trigger warning.</p>
<p>In fairness, when you bring 8000 people together and you get a wide enough group of people,</p>
<p>there was swat stickers and white confederate flags that were flown.</p>
<p>So it might have been two of 8000.</p>
<p>But that did happen within any protest movement, which I just said.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Within any protest movement, there&rsquo;s always gonna be a handful of people who go too far</p>
<p>and are too extreme.</p>
<p>But they did not represent the vast, vast majority of the people who turned out, which</p>
<p>are ordinary citizens.</p>
<p>And Trudeau seized on a handful of isolated examples to try and demonize these guys.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s blowing up in his face.</p>
<p>The fact of the matter is the truckers did not start this fight.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the zealotry of our elites, of our professional class that started this fight.</p>
<p>They will not give up on these mandates.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the fundamental problem.</p>
<p>And while they go to the Super Bowl with no mascot.</p>
<p>I think what you&rsquo;re seeing here with this trucker thing, I think it&rsquo;s going to have</p>
<p>huge ripple effects because it&rsquo;s showing the schism in the Democratic Party between the</p>
<p>professional elites and the working class.</p>
<p>Here you have the working class.</p>
<p>Remember, these were the essential workers.</p>
<p>These are the people bringing us our food.</p>
<p>Most of them have already had COVID over the last couple of years.</p>
<p>They couldn&rsquo;t sit behind a computer and do their job in their pajamas on Zoom all day.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So these guys know the reality of COVID just like you learned the reality, Jason, when</p>
<p>you actually got it.</p>
<p>And yet we&rsquo;ve got this neurotic class of professionals within the Democratic Party who are these</p>
<p>COVID dead-enders don&rsquo;t want to give this stuff up.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the fundamental divide.</p>
<p>And I think Biden&rsquo;s going to have to choose which side are you on?</p>
<p>Are you on the side of the working class or the professional class?</p>
<p>Trudeau has chosen his side.</p>
<p>He is the effete elite face of these COVID dead-enders.</p>
<p>And Biden&rsquo;s going to have to choose who he supports.</p>
<p>And those are dwindling.</p>
<p>You have governors now who are Democratic governors in many states who are saying,</p>
<p>listen, Omicron is obviously different.</p>
<p>And look at the charts.</p>
<p>Look at the data.</p>
<p>We have to talk about this New York Times story on how New Jersey and several other</p>
<p>of these blue states dropped the mask mandates.</p>
<p>It was absolutely extraordinary.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s not extraordinary.</p>
<p>The risk assessment is different, David.</p>
<p>What was extraordinary about it is that&hellip;</p>
<p>I mean, I think it&rsquo;s kind of obvious more than extraordinary.</p>
<p>If Omicron is less deadly, it&rsquo;s an upper respiratory, doesn&rsquo;t kill people who are</p>
<p>vaccinated, and most people are vaccinated, pretty obviously it&rsquo;s time to pivot and open</p>
<p>everything up.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s time to make an obvious decision.</p>
<p>Biden really missed his moment here.</p>
<p>So I think, you know, like Friedberg said, it was Phil Murphy.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a Democratic governor in New Jersey.</p>
<p>He was supposed to have an easy reelect win by 20 to 30 points.</p>
<p>He narrowly squeaks by, by two to three points, okay?</p>
<p>So then he conducts the focus groups to find out what did we miss?</p>
<p>Why were we so off on this thing?</p>
<p>And they find out that people are so tired of these mandates.</p>
<p>He goes to the White House, okay?</p>
<p>And shows these findings and says, guys, we have to get off this losing position on COVID.</p>
<p>And the White House sits on his hands and does absolutely nothing.</p>
<p>So Murphy is like, we can&rsquo;t wait anymore.</p>
<p>So he unilaterally goes without White House support.</p>
<p>This is all in the New York Times article.</p>
<p>This is not like some right-wing publication saying this, okay?</p>
<p>So he unilaterally says, okay, we&rsquo;re getting rid of the mask mandate, okay?</p>
<p>And then five other states do the same thing because they realize we can&rsquo;t wait anymore.</p>
<p>And Biden is just nowhere to be found.</p>
<p>And Psaki is saying, well, we&rsquo;re deferring to the CDC.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re deferring to, you know, Rachel Walensky at the CDC and Randy Weingartner at the teachers</p>
<p>unions and these health officials like Barbara Furrier in LA County, all of whom are saying</p>
<p>we cannot lift these mandates yet.</p>
<p>So they are completely on the wrong side of this.</p>
<p>And then Biden really steps in it by saying to Trudeau in Canada, listen, you guys got</p>
<p>to clear this bridge.</p>
<p>Do whatever you need to do to clear this bridge.</p>
<p>Basically implying that the civil disobedience needs to be met by force.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;ve got Harvard professors and CNN analysts saying slash their tires, take</p>
<p>away their trucking licenses, starve them out, you know?</p>
<p>So this has been the response.</p>
<p>And the response to that is now there&rsquo;s a trucker convoy getting started in the US and</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going to march on Washington.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to drive to Washington.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>And between now and then Biden better figure out what side he&rsquo;s going to be on.</p>
<p>Because if he doesn&rsquo;t handle this right, I think it&rsquo;s going to be the end of his presidency.</p>
<p>Peaceful civil disobedience is fine as long as they&rsquo;re not blocking ambulances,</p>
<p>getting people to and from hospitals.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>Especially if they&rsquo;ve been vaccinated on respirators.</p>
<p>Joe Biden, is this Scranton Joe, the guy who said he would take us back to normalcy, the</p>
<p>representative of the working class, is that who the president of the United States is?</p>
<p>Or is he in the Trudeau camp, you know, the Fauci and the Walensky and the Barber Ferrer&rsquo;s?</p>
<p>Or is he out of it and easily influenced?</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re asking a rhetorical question.</p>
<p>I think that the polling data makes the answer pretty clear, which is that the Democratic</p>
<p>Party is lurching towards establishment insiders.</p>
<p>And working, normal, ordinary people have in larger and larger numbers started gravitating</p>
<p>towards to the Republican Party.</p>
<p>Minorities in far larger numbers than we ever expected have started lurching towards the</p>
<p>Republican Party.</p>
<p>And so the answer is sort of in the polling data and what what the actual facts on the</p>
<p>ground have been, you know, I mean, we forget, because we were also ready to, to cast away</p>
<p>our Trump derangement syndrome syndrome, but he did get I think, what was it 9 million</p>
<p>more people to vote for him in this past election?</p>
<p>Yeah, the working class, whether they&rsquo;re the white working class or the non white working</p>
<p>class are moving in huge numbers.</p>
<p>I think the margin of non white working class who moved to the Republicans last election</p>
<p>was 18 points.</p>
<p>They got 18 points more share than eight years ago.</p>
<p>So the working class, regardless of their race, is moving towards the Republicans, while</p>
<p>the Democrats are becoming this more a feat elite professional class party, this woke</p>
<p>elite party.</p>
<p>And, you know, I think Biden sort of is caught in the middle of this.</p>
<p>And I think he&rsquo;s running out of time to try and reestablish that he&rsquo;s going to have a</p>
<p>centrist presidency that does not completely kowtow and defer to the left of his party</p>
<p>to this sort of woke elite thinking.</p>
<p>You know, you see democratic political scientists like Roy Tushara writing about this like every</p>
<p>week saying this is your last chance.</p>
<p>This is your moment to save your presidency.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if he&rsquo;s listening.</p>
<p>Okay, Friedberg, we made some great progress in science this week in nuclear fusion.</p>
<p>You want to tee this up for us?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m happy to.</p>
<p>So let me just give a little background for maybe a minute on fusion.</p>
<p>So you know, the the way energy is made in the sun and in all stars is through this process</p>
<p>of nuclear fusion, where hydrogen nuclei, the protons inside of hydrogen atoms shoot</p>
<p>around at such a high energy, and they&rsquo;re so dense because of the amount of hydrogen</p>
<p>it all causes gravity to pull them all together, they get really dense, they start slamming</p>
<p>into each other, when they slam into each other, they fuse into helium, and ultimately,</p>
<p>the heavier elements and release energy in the process.</p>
<p>And that is what fusion is.</p>
<p>So you know, we talked about nuclear energy on Earth, all nuclear energy that we generated</p>
<p>on Earth, as a species to date has been through fission, where we take much heavier elements</p>
<p>like plutonium and uranium, and they break apart by squeezing them together, and they</p>
<p>release energy.</p>
<p>But this creates radioactive material, it&rsquo;s dangerous, it&rsquo;s very, very expensive, and</p>
<p>so on.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s always been a question since roughly the 1950s, on whether or not we could recreate</p>
<p>the conditions of the sun or stars on planet Earth, by creating a plasma by creating the</p>
<p>same sort of plasma that exists inside of stars very hot, very fast, very dense hydrogen</p>
<p>that can slam into itself and slam into atoms and fuse into helium and release energy.</p>
<p>Does that same plasma exist on Uranus?</p>
<p>Uh-huh.</p>
<p>Yeah, God, you&rsquo;re gonna give him a wedgie.</p>
<p>Let science boy finish.</p>
<p>Come on.</p>
<p>Oh, sorry.</p>
<p>Back to you.</p>
<p>Never gets old.</p>
<p>Was it 69 megajoules or 420 megajoules?</p>
<p>So plasma fusion has always been this kind of holy grail of energy, because if you can</p>
<p>actually generate plasma fusion, the amount of energy it takes to create the plasma is</p>
<p>less than the energy that comes out of the plasma.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s effectively infinite, free, cheap plasma.</p>
<p>And so the system that people have been building for the last 25-30 years is these donut shaped</p>
<p>systems called tokamaks.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like a circle or like a donut, and they spin the plasma around inside.</p>
<p>And so it takes a lot of energy and magnets and so on to try and make this work.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s a company we talked about a few months ago called Commonwealth Fusion</p>
<p>Systems, which uses a new superconducting material to control that plasma and use instead</p>
<p>of using expensive magnets may just raise $1.8 billion.</p>
<p>And, you know, more recently, the joint European Taurus, which is managed by the Atomic Energy</p>
<p>Authority in the United Kingdom, just this week demonstrated energy output from their</p>
<p>tokamak plasma fusion system, where they generated, you know, 59 megawatts of energy in five seconds,</p>
<p>which is a record.</p>
<p>The prior record was set in 1997.</p>
<p>By that same agency, they generated 16 megawatts of power output.</p>
<p>So it was a great breakthrough.</p>
<p>And you know, to make this all possible has required technical breakthroughs in electronics,</p>
<p>technical breakthroughs in sensors and computing and hardware and material science and superconductors.</p>
<p>And so all of this is starting to coalesce that plasma fusion might actually become a</p>
<p>reality.</p>
<p>And the ITARE system, which is the biggest construction project in Europe, 35 nations</p>
<p>have contributed a total of roughly 50 to $60 billion to make this system is going to</p>
<p>go online around 2027.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve been building it for 20 years, it&rsquo;s going to be a 500 megawatt demonstration system.</p>
<p>And if it works, then it opens up the door that in the future, we may actually be able</p>
<p>to turn plasma fusion into an energy source for all of humanity.</p>
<p>It basically would use water plasma fusion is made from taking hydrogen, which you would</p>
<p>get from water, spinning it around heating it up, getting it to be really, really dense,</p>
<p>and ultimately driving power out of it.</p>
<p>The implications are extraordinary, right?</p>
<p>So over the next few decades, it is appearing more likely that we will have plasma fusion</p>
<p>systems working on Earth.</p>
<p>And as that happens, energy becomes free, and it becomes unlimited.</p>
<p>And with unlimited free energy, we can terraform Earth, right, we can take ocean water, desal it,</p>
<p>turn it into freshwater, we can pump that into deserts, turn them into rainforests.</p>
<p>You know, the total annual production of energy on Earth today is about 170 terawatt hours,</p>
<p>that amount of energy could be generated from just a 10 foot by 10 foot by 10 foot cube of water.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the amount of energy, the amount of material that would be turned into photons</p>
<p>that would drive all of the electricity we need on Earth.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s an incredible technology and incredible breakthrough.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re starting to see this stuff happen.</p>
<p>One area that I wanted to kind of just highlight, which no one talks about,</p>
<p>but which I think is extraordinarily important, about 100 years from now, let&rsquo;s say,</p>
<p>as these plasma fusion systems work, it&rsquo;s certainly going to be true that we&rsquo;ll have</p>
<p>abundant free energy during the back half of this century.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;ll change everything, we&rsquo;ll decarbonize the atmosphere, we&rsquo;ll terraform the planet,</p>
<p>we can make whatever we want, we can build things, etc.</p>
<p>But the same system of plasma fusion theoretically could be used to fuse heavier elements</p>
<p>than just helium.</p>
<p>So fast forward 100 or 200 years, if we can actually make plasma fusion systems work,</p>
<p>we could also and to make helium to make energy, we could also use them to make heavier elements,</p>
<p>like the rare earth metals that we talk about being so important here on Earth to make</p>
<p>batteries, or phosphorus, which you know, we&rsquo;re going to run out of on planet Earth</p>
<p>in about 100 years, which is a critical component of agriculture and feeding ourselves.</p>
<p>So you know, over the next call it 100 years plasma fusion systems, I think back half of</p>
<p>this century, come online, provide us with abundant free energy.</p>
<p>And then in the 22nd century, I think this idea of nucleosynthesis, the idea that we</p>
<p>can actually make the rare earth or the heavier elements that are limited natural resources</p>
<p>here on Earth, where we can turn water into gold or water into lithium or water into molybdenum,</p>
<p>or you know, into beryllium or whatever, starts to become a reality.</p>
<p>And so this to me, like, I feel like we&rsquo;re on the eve of plasma fusion being a reality,</p>
<p>you know, based on some of the results we&rsquo;re seeing.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s one after the other I tear is going to come online, you know,</p>
<p>Commonwealth fusion had their materials breakthrough and on and on and on.</p>
<p>So this seems to be building up.</p>
<p>And so the 20 tipping point, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>I think the 2030s and the 2040s are where this becomes real.</p>
<p>And all these problems and concerns we have about climate change, and carbon in the atmosphere,</p>
<p>all of this stuff can be reversed with infinite energy.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m optimistic, and I&rsquo;m excited about a lot of what we&rsquo;re seeing.</p>
<p>Let me ask you one question.</p>
<p>Obviously, when people start hearing about nuclear reactors and fission,</p>
<p>and then they start learning about fusion, they immediately have the Chernobyls of the</p>
<p>world and Fukushima has come to mind and nuclear bombs.</p>
<p>In this case, when this reaction occurs, my understanding, I&rsquo;ve interviewed a couple</p>
<p>of people working on these reactors, is that the reaction just fizzles out, it just stops.</p>
<p>And then it&rsquo;s not radioactive.</p>
<p>So these, these are not radioactive materials that naturally decay into radioactive</p>
<p>ions or particles that can damage the body or damage.</p>
<p>These are literally just hydrogen atoms that are spun around so hot and smashed into each other.</p>
<p>So if the machine breaks, everything just turns off.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>And the output, even when it&rsquo;s working, my understanding is some natural,</p>
<p>like just air and water.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s no output.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no, there&rsquo;s nothing radioactive.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no, there&rsquo;s nothing to deal with.</p>
<p>Let me fast forward 200 years.</p>
<p>So now assume these systems work.</p>
<p>As you guys know, all technology over time gets better, faster, cheaper, smaller.</p>
<p>So in 200 years, we could find that we have plasma fusion reactions in every pocket,</p>
<p>in every computer, in every phone, imagine a world where we no longer need batteries,</p>
<p>where we no longer need transmission lines, and where a system can literally pull hydrogen</p>
<p>out of the air, generate electricity on the fly.</p>
<p>And it sounds crazy.</p>
<p>But people thought, people would have never thought that the batteries that we put inside</p>
<p>of phones would have existed when the first flow cell battery cell was made, you know,</p>
<p>whatever, you know, during the early days of chemistry, electrical chemistry.</p>
<p>So, you know, the idea that we&rsquo;ve been able to shrink batteries as we have,</p>
<p>the idea that we&rsquo;ve been able to make generators like we have today,</p>
<p>these were concepts that would have been so foreign.</p>
<p>So I do think that in 200 years, if plasma fusion systems work, there&rsquo;s nothing about</p>
<p>the laws of physics that says they&rsquo;re limited in scale to only being large.</p>
<p>They theoretically could be reduced down to there&rsquo;s no limit to the size they could</p>
<p>drop down to.</p>
<p>And so there could be a world 200 years from now, where plasma fusion reactors exist in</p>
<p>every component that needs electricity.</p>
<p>And so ultimately, you could see putting these systems on spaceships, and using them to convert</p>
<p>elements from one form to another, and we could live for, you know, 100,000 years on</p>
<p>a spaceship, and just recycle the elements on that spaceship to produce all our food</p>
<p>and our air and everything.</p>
<p>Yeah, for sure, we could get to Uranus with that.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>And back.</p>
<p>The summary.</p>
<p>And back.</p>
<p>You could circle his anus.</p>
<p>So that was my diatribe on plasma fusion.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m super excited about some of the progress we&rsquo;re seeing.</p>
<p>Right now, Sax is wondering, how do we wet our beaks?</p>
<p>Just tell us where to place the bet.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nowhere yet.</p>
<p>I mean, honestly, I don&rsquo;t place bets on things that take 100,000 years.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s only 100 years, Sax.</p>
<p>Oh, 100 years.</p>
<p>Sorry.</p>
<p>100,000 years.</p>
<p>I invest in things that might materialize in four years.</p>
<p>Sorry.</p>
<p>100 weeks.</p>
<p>He needs to upgrade his plane.</p>
<p>Sax&rsquo;s bills are due next month.</p>
<p>Not an urgent call, Sax.</p>
<p>I got bills to pay.</p>
<p>I got bills.</p>
<p>A big part of the, you know, just speaking markets for a second.</p>
<p>I mentioned to you guys at the end of last year that I made a bet on energy stocks.</p>
<p>And the reason I made a bet on energy stocks is because some of the breakthroughs that we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>seeing in decarbonization and renewable energy has driven a reduction in capital improvements</p>
<p>across energy infrastructure.</p>
<p>Because people are so optimistic about what&rsquo;s over the horizon.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re so pessimistic about carbon intensive energy systems</p>
<p>that we actually have under invested over the past few years</p>
<p>in energy infrastructure that it&rsquo;s turning out today is critically needed.</p>
<p>So while this is a great long term kind of optimistic world scenario,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s going to decarbonize energy production and energy systems in the near term,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re actually struggling a bit to meet our energy demands.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a lot of leverage that energy producers have over those that are the</p>
<p>consumers as we&rsquo;re seeing currently with the Russia, Ukraine, Europe crisis, and so on.</p>
<p>And so part of the reason for the climb in energy stocks over the last couple of weeks</p>
<p>has been largely driven by the fact that we&rsquo;re realizing that this under investment in capex</p>
<p>has created a decline in productivity of these assets relative to the demand.</p>
<p>And so suddenly, everyone&rsquo;s like, Oh my gosh, these things are gonna be able to charge more</p>
<p>commodity prices are going up, and so on.</p>
<p>So you know, it&rsquo;s very hard to think about playing an investment cycle around this stuff,</p>
<p>because in the near term, there&rsquo;s still significant demand and we only have</p>
<p>carbon intensive systems to produce energy.</p>
<p>Well, I was gonna ask you, if does this mean on an investment thesis,</p>
<p>you might see a massive spike in carbon based</p>
<p>fuel systems, and these are wealth funds, and then a dramatic drop off?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Okay, what do you predict will happen?</p>
<p>The nobody will support anybody investing in pulling more oil out of the ground,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll, they&rsquo;ll support trying to get more from what we have.</p>
<p>But, you know, I don&rsquo;t know if you guys saw, but you know,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no support for this, whether you&rsquo;re an investor, and you go activist on some of</p>
<p>these oil companies.</p>
<p>You know, whether you&rsquo;re I think they&rsquo;re Biden had a big setback, because,</p>
<p>you know, he had cleared a whole like millions of acres of offshore</p>
<p>land for some point, some kind of energy extraction that was then just reversed by</p>
<p>the courts.</p>
<p>No, no, but nobody has support for this stuff.</p>
<p>But what you&rsquo;re saying is exactly right.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s exactly the reason oil prices are climbing.</p>
<p>I just sent you guys a link to what&rsquo;s going on today.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re climbing for the wrong reason.</p>
<p>So look, let&rsquo;s just be realistic here.</p>
<p>We, you know, we have a cartel, it&rsquo;s called OPEC, you know, and what they do is they decide</p>
<p>output.</p>
<p>And we have some balance checks and balances to OPEC, namely Russia and a few other actors,</p>
<p>who will try to then regulate supply and demand so that there&rsquo;s mutually assured destruction.</p>
<p>The net result of all of that right now is that we do have some constraint supply for</p>
<p>the amount that we need to get to get back to the level of production we had pre pandemic.</p>
<p>So we are going to have some sustained energy prices.</p>
<p>But you saw something really important this past week.</p>
<p>Everybody was waiting for this big CPI print, right, the consumer price index print.</p>
<p>Everybody thought it was going to be a bad number.</p>
<p>It was a pretty bad number.</p>
<p>But the markets were pretty responsive to it.</p>
<p>And, and then it&rsquo;s been pretty responsive the rest of the week, despite a whole bunch</p>
<p>of stuff.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you guys saw, but like yesterday, there was this crazy article where, you know,</p>
<p>one of the Fed governors was like, we should raise by 100 basis points by July.</p>
<p>And, you know, we should do eight, eight raises.</p>
<p>And the markets were like, what are you talking about?</p>
<p>And why is that?</p>
<p>Because now people have started to look, you know, I&rsquo;ve mentioned this before, when you</p>
<p>go into a rate cycle, we&rsquo;re kind of past worrying about how many we kind of look to</p>
<p>the end and decide what we want to believe about the future.</p>
<p>And one of the most interesting things is the rate of change of this inflation was actually</p>
<p>lower month over month.</p>
<p>And so if you think about it that way, we had a bad CPI print, but it&rsquo;s actually not</p>
<p>going up as much.</p>
<p>And in fact, it&rsquo;s starting to trail off.</p>
<p>And a lot of economists now forecast basically this inflation peaking or already having peaked</p>
<p>over the last few weeks.</p>
<p>Consumer sentiment is not so good.</p>
<p>A lot of us are now shifting our consumption away from goods to more services, we&rsquo;re, we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>stopping, you know, the hoarding of the toilet papers of the world, if you will.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m not a big buyer of this trade, to be honest with you, Friedberg, I think</p>
<p>that it works in the short term, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s an investment, I think, at some point,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to have to make a decision about what your view on energy is.</p>
<p>I know, I agree.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think this is a long term trade, not an investment.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>But I do, I do think that the macro sentiment sent the market in one direction, it creates</p>
<p>this up, it created a buying opportunity, which I was pretty clear about.</p>
<p>And I do think that some of this global tension stuff we&rsquo;re seeing is only going to drive</p>
<p>it up for a while.</p>
<p>I do, I do think, however, that the the this big tech spread trade is moving from a trade</p>
<p>to an investment, actually.</p>
<p>And that I didn&rsquo;t expect.</p>
<p>And the reason is, I talked to a bunch of folks on Wall Street over this past week.</p>
<p>And they told me two things.</p>
<p>And one of them is a segue, because I think we should talk about Microsoft, which is another</p>
<p>brilliant move in the lexicon of business.</p>
<p>But what they said was, Facebook has become a funding short for other investments.</p>
<p>Now, what does that mean?</p>
<p>Everybody was crowded into big tech, we talked about this before, right?</p>
<p>Those five stocks were broadly owned, they were effectively the index.</p>
<p>But after that, after that earnings report, a lot of investors, including retail investors</p>
<p>had to decide where to reallocate their capital, and had to decide where to invest, where the</p>
<p>money was going to come from to invest in these other names that were really beaten up.</p>
<p>And what folks on Wall Street have been telling me is that, you know, Facebook has become</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s called a funding short, meaning there is no bid to buy that from institutional owners.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;d rather on the margin sell it to generate the cash to then take and invest in other</p>
<p>things.</p>
<p>And what you saw over this past week is the bottoming out of a lot of these growth stocks</p>
<p>that were beaten up, right, they rallied pretty significantly every day, three, four,</p>
<p>five, 6% rallies.</p>
<p>And other names in big tech have rallied really well, including Microsoft.</p>
<p>And, and so I think that there is the potential, a small potential, that that&rsquo;s going from</p>
<p>a trade to an investment, actually, a sustainable trend that you can bank on for, you know,</p>
<p>several years, investment, hold the stock for 510 years, the trade that spread trade,</p>
<p>you can hold for a long period of time, but for the winners to be the winners in that</p>
<p>just so people get refreshed, Google, Microsoft, Google, Microsoft, Google, and then you feel</p>
<p>Amazon, Facebook, obviously, and Netflix are the losers in that trade.</p>
<p>Still feel that way?</p>
<p>I think that Microsoft and Google are far and away the winners, far and away the winners.</p>
<p>And look, you saw, you saw, you saw this Microsoft thing today, or sorry, this past week, so</p>
<p>smart, you know?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So just to give, catch people up on that, Microsoft has made another savvy move to get</p>
<p>approval for their $75 billion Activision Blizzard acquisition.</p>
<p>They promised their video game app store would operate with open market principles.</p>
<p>CEO of the year, Satya Nadella, and others travel to Washington, Nadella, Nadella, right,</p>
<p>the Senate at the end, travel to Washington this week to meet with regulators regarding</p>
<p>the acquisition.</p>
<p>So they, I guess, are proactively going to Washington as opposed to other people who</p>
<p>maybe are not.</p>
<p>Quote from Microsoft President Brad Smith, we are more focused on adopting, adapting</p>
<p>to regulation than fighting against it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s some really interesting kung fu right there.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a famous story about this explorer named Hernando Cortez, where, you know, we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>all heard this analogy, or this, this, this little phrase before, where, you know, when</p>
<p>they were exploring, coming from Europe, and, you know, they hit the Caribbean islands,</p>
<p>and then, you know, looking for America, etc.</p>
<p>The famous phrase is burn the boats.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t go back, we have to find our way, make it work.</p>
<p>The, the way that that&rsquo;s been extended in business is sort of what we would call scorched</p>
<p>the earth.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a competitive move that a lot of businesses, if they&rsquo;re smart enough can</p>
<p>execute, which is to effectively take a key market, and take an economic view of that</p>
<p>market, where you say that we&rsquo;re going to take all the economic value away from it.</p>
<p>And I think this is a first step towards a really interesting play that Microsoft could</p>
<p>pull, which is essentially to scorch the earth of app stores, which is Google&rsquo;s and Apple&rsquo;s</p>
<p>really big money printer to make a completely open permissible platform with very little</p>
<p>to no take rate.</p>
<p>And in a market as big as video games, I think what it does is it creates pressure on all</p>
<p>these other mega platforms to essentially copy them.</p>
<p>And I think Friedberg mentioned this before, Google has actually been the best in doing</p>
<p>this by finding these key markets, or I think it was sacks, you know, Chrome and other things</p>
<p>and giving them away for free.</p>
<p>Google is in a position to make the app store effectively free.</p>
<p>And then that puts Apple on a little bit of a desert island.</p>
<p>So Jason, back to why I think you can keep Apple in that basket of shorts, the competitive</p>
<p>pressures are mounting by by the moves of Microsoft that I think are easier for Google</p>
<p>to copy, and very difficult for companies like Apple to copy because it creates an incredible</p>
<p>disincentive.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And also, as part of this open app store concept, they will let you use any payment system.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re on an iPhone, and you want to use Apple pay with a Google app purchase,</p>
<p>you can do that.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re on, you know, Microsoft, you can use PayPal as an example.</p>
<p>Saks, what do you what do you think about inflation?</p>
<p>Okay, there was a really interesting chart on inflation that actually zero hedge tweeted.</p>
<p>And I threw it up in the notes here, where they said real hourly earnings are negative</p>
<p>1.7%.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the 10th month in a row where US incomes aren&rsquo;t keeping up with inflation.</p>
<p>So the problem here is that, you know, people&rsquo;s incomes have increased with inflation, but not</p>
<p>as much as the inflation rate.</p>
<p>So the net effect of it is that people are feeling worse off when they go to the grocery</p>
<p>store to buy groceries or whatever they need.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t feel as rich.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the fundamental problem here.</p>
<p>And I think there&rsquo;s a lot of people out there who think that there&rsquo;s a free lunch that if we</p>
<p>printed 2 trillion worth of stimmy checks, this is the whole that $2 trillion bill last</p>
<p>year they shoveled through, I think the idea was, we&rsquo;re going to print as much money as</p>
<p>we can for the election.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s going to help us in the midterms.</p>
<p>Actually, as it turns out, it boosted inflation so much that people are feeling worse off,</p>
<p>even though their wages went up slightly, because on a net basis, their earnings are</p>
<p>down.</p>
<p>So I just think it&rsquo;s a good reminder that you can&rsquo;t just like print wealth, you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>print your way to prosperity.</p>
<p>No free lunches.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no free lunches.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Or we&rsquo;re going to create addiction to universal income or universal subsidy.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the alternative is people are going to basically try and vote to make some programs</p>
<p>that were initially meant to be temporary, more permanent, in order to keep up the lifestyle</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;ve become accustomed to.</p>
<p>Just just to build on sexist point, the University of Michigan consumer sentiment was released,</p>
<p>I think it was today this morning.</p>
<p>And it shows exactly what he&rsquo;s saying, which is that, you know, consumers propensity and</p>
<p>confidence in the economy has been falling off a cliff.</p>
<p>You know, the month over month change was almost it was down 8.2%.</p>
<p>The year over year change is down almost 20%.</p>
<p>Current economic conditions was down 20%.</p>
<p>And then index of consumer expectations down 19%.</p>
<p>So to, to access point, people are scared.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, we&rsquo;ve been we&rsquo;ve been talking on the show for the last, I&rsquo;d say a couple</p>
<p>of months about balancing the risk of recession versus the risk of inflation.</p>
<p>Inflation, I think has gotten slightly worse.</p>
<p>The print went from the last print was like 7.1% now some point 5%.</p>
<p>So to Tomas point earlier, it&rsquo;s getting worse, but the rate of how fast it&rsquo;s getting worse</p>
<p>but the risk of recession, I think is increasing.</p>
<p>Because what&rsquo;s keeping this economy going is the consumer.</p>
<p>And if the consumer sentiment now all of a sudden is tanking, and people feel poor because</p>
<p>of inflation, I just, you know, now that the risks are starting to become a sentiment goes</p>
<p>down.</p>
<p>This is where governors play a critical role, because if they don&rsquo;t open up these economies,</p>
<p>we can&rsquo;t actually have a consumer led consumption rebound of the economy, because there aren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>any services to buy because you can&rsquo;t actually be around anybody.</p>
<p>So if the economy remains effectively closed, and people are done buying, you know, tubs</p>
<p>of margarine and toilet paper, because you know, Armageddon isn&rsquo;t coming as we were worried</p>
<p>it would, what are we supposed to be doing?</p>
<p>So this is how these things interplay.</p>
<p>So we have to get these again, going back to where we started, we have to get this economy</p>
<p>open.</p>
<p>And we have to just get back to some sense of normalcy and the consumer will lead us</p>
<p>out.</p>
<p>But I think sacks, you&rsquo;re right on the margin, I think the risk is towards a recession, because</p>
<p>people don&rsquo;t see this Thomas Sowell, who&rsquo;s a well known Stanford, he&rsquo;s a I think he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a senior fellow at Hoover.</p>
<p>You know, he has this comment, which is effectively taxes are bad for the rich and the poor, but</p>
<p>inflation is bad just for the poor.</p>
<p>And the reason he says that is because, you know, if you&rsquo;re wealthy, you can transition</p>
<p>to assets that are sort of inflation adjusted or inflation protected, right, you can consume</p>
<p>assets, or you can purchase assets to protect yourself.</p>
<p>But inflation is an exceptionally regressive means of the government taking compensation</p>
<p>away from your current compensation, and it disproportionately affects working class ordinary</p>
<p>people.</p>
<p>And so if you have real wages that are negative inflation, that&rsquo;s high, that&rsquo;s confiscatory,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>You are you are meaningfully less well off than you were before.</p>
<p>And, you know, wealthy folks have a way to hedge but normal ordinary working class people</p>
<p>do not.</p>
<p>And on the margin, then if they then do not go out and spend, the problem will be some</p>
<p>sort of recessionary effect.</p>
<p>I also think if we open up, more people might, since they&rsquo;re so lonely and getting weird</p>
<p>staying at home, I think they might actually want to go do jobs to socialize and do things</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m seeing people want to get out and do, you know, trips with their teams and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re sick of staying home.</p>
<p>Salesforce just bought a retreat center and we saw this south of the city, the Bay Area</p>
<p>and because Benioff&rsquo;s got a concern, I guess that all these employees he hired over two</p>
<p>years who&rsquo;ve never met another Salesforce employee are getting weird and lonely.</p>
<p>And, you know,</p>
<p>I think David, you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>I think history is going to be really judgmental of Biden.</p>
<p>If he is the last person to basically give the green light and all of these democratic</p>
<p>governors basically revolt and open up under underneath, you know, either silence or the</p>
<p>complete opposite point of view.</p>
<p>This is a really bad setup.</p>
<p>Well, National Journal, which again is not some right-wing publication, they&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>sort of an analyst of what&rsquo;s happening in Washington, said that an article, Biden is</p>
<p>blowing his COVID moment.</p>
<p>He was elected to lead us back to normalcy.</p>
<p>All he had to do was say, guys, it&rsquo;s time for the restrictions to come off and take</p>
<p>credit for the fact that we were, that the whole country was ready to move on.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s kind of missed it.</p>
<p>And, but this trucker convoy that&rsquo;s coming to Washington gives him one more chance, I</p>
<p>think, to get on the right side of this, because there&rsquo;s really two ways he can react.</p>
<p>One is to treat them as, you know, domestic terrorists, you know, racists, white supremacists,</p>
<p>insurrectionaries, or he can, you know, embrace them and say, all he has to do is say, listen,</p>
<p>we love you.</p>
<p>We respect you.</p>
<p>We hear you.</p>
<p>We agree with you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s time for these mandates to end.</p>
<p>And you know what?</p>
<p>Thank you, Rachel Walensky and Anthony Fauci for your service.</p>
<p>We understand you&rsquo;re just trying to keep the country safe, but thank you very much.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re ready to move on.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re getting rid of all these restrictions.</p>
<p>His popularity would like bounce five points, 10 points if he did that.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m betting he&rsquo;s going to.</p>
<p>I mean, he&rsquo;s always represented the working men and women of this country.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s been his thing from the beginning.</p>
<p>I bet you he does embrace them.</p>
<p>And if you look at Omicron, remember the scariness of December?</p>
<p>Hey, this thing is spreading 30, 40, 50 times faster.</p>
<p>I wonder if it&rsquo;s going to have the same death rate.</p>
<p>And we didn&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>And now we know.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s February.</p>
<p>Two months later, we know that the curve in South Africa, same as a curve in New York</p>
<p>and California, up and down.</p>
<p>And then the only people who die seemingly are immunocompromised or unvaccinated or both.</p>
<p>So it feels like the perfect time.</p>
<p>You know who really led us back to normalcy?</p>
<p>I mean, we really need to give credit to all the people who fought.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the moms who went to these school board meetings, who were denounced as domestic</p>
<p>terrorists.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re the ones who put pressure to repeal these mask mandates on their kids, which,</p>
<p>by the way, aren&rsquo;t even fully off.</p>
<p>In New York and California, adults don&rsquo;t have to wear masks anymore, but the kids do.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the scientists.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the scientists of the Great Barrington Declaration who were demonized and called</p>
<p>fringe and kooks and conspiracy theorists.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re the ones who provided the real data against lockdowns, not the NIH.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s these truckers who are basically opposing mandates.</p>
<p>These are the people who are dragging us back to normalcy.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s the politicians who are reacting to that when the polls change.</p>
<p>And I think what the people want now is some real leadership.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a politician who gets up there and leads us back to normalcy.</p>
<p>Why can&rsquo;t Biden do that?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a great article in the Times, and they profiled, you know, a couple of people,</p>
<p>and one of them was a mom in New York who&rsquo;s running for Congress against, you know, an</p>
<p>intention, an entrenched Democrat.</p>
<p>And she&rsquo;s, I mean, you know, she&rsquo;s just a good hearted mom who was like, this is enough.</p>
<p>Enough&rsquo;s enough.</p>
<p>I need to get back to normalcy.</p>
<p>My kids need to get back in school.</p>
<p>We still have mask mandates here in California.</p>
<p>Kids are still wearing a mask in school.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s becoming tribal warfare amongst the Democrats in California, because even when,</p>
<p>you know, the governor basically said, okay, mask mandates can go on X date.</p>
<p>The county supervisors have not decided.</p>
<p>So, for example, in Santa Clara County, you know, they&rsquo;ve not said yes.</p>
<p>In LA County, there&rsquo;s a health director, an unelected bureaucrat, a health director named</p>
<p>Barbara Ferrer.</p>
<p>She calls the shots on COVID.</p>
<p>After Newsom basically said that the masks can come off, she says, no, they can&rsquo;t, not</p>
<p>until April.</p>
<p>Who is this person giving us orders?</p>
<p>She told this to the board of supervisors down there, and we&rsquo;re all just supposed to</p>
<p>listen?</p>
<p>Now, the reason why she has this authority is because Newsom is granted to her under</p>
<p>Newsom&rsquo;s state of emergency.</p>
<p>So, what he should do is end that.</p>
<p>What is the emergency?</p>
<p>The Super Bowl is happening this weekend in the state, and everyone&rsquo;s going to be there</p>
<p>maskless.</p>
<p>I mean, I was at the Warriors game last night, and you had people wearing the most flimsy</p>
<p>of masks that does nothing to protect, people taking them off while they&rsquo;re eating and</p>
<p>drinking, and then people walking around with signs.</p>
<p>The security guards had signs that said, please put your mask on, and they were walking up</p>
<p>to people, I kid you not, and putting this like little round sign in people&rsquo;s faces and</p>
<p>not talking to them, just, you know, and they would stand there until you put your mask</p>
<p>back on.</p>
<p>And like, you&rsquo;re literally eating a hot dog, and then you put the hot dog down, and then</p>
<p>they come up and put the sign in your face.</p>
<p>You put your mask up, you take another bite of your hot dog.</p>
<p>I mean, it was getting unnecessarily confrontational, and just weird, and nowhere else are you seeing</p>
<p>it, and then you go to a restaurant, and the employees are wearing masks, and nobody else</p>
<p>is.</p>
<p>I hope you can find it.</p>
<p>So weird.</p>
<p>There was this clip on Twitter, when the mask mandate was lifted in Nevada, and it was a</p>
<p>clip of kids in like grade two or three, and they went crazy.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And the reason they were so excited was like, they got to be normal again.</p>
<p>And the explanation, I had never heard this more beautifully said, these children can</p>
<p>finally see their friends as emotions on their face.</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>Can you imagine if you&rsquo;re four, five, six, seven years old, and you cannot understand</p>
<p>the emotions of other kids, because you&rsquo;re covered up in a mask, and you&rsquo;ve only had</p>
<p>an experience in school, two years in school.</p>
<p>My six-year-old has never attended a day of school without a mask.</p>
<p>I was about to say, right?</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s kids out there who have never had a clip.</p>
<p>And you know, I was at horses with one of my kids last weekend, and there were a bunch</p>
<p>of kids out there riding.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sunny.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s outside.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re on a horse.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all wearing masks in a voluntary optional situation.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just like, how brainwashed.</p>
<p>This generation that we&rsquo;re raising, I mean, they&rsquo;re going to be so neurotic, but they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>also like brainwashed.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s crazy.</p>
<p>We see it in the Bay Area.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;ll have a party with the kids or a group of kids come over, and there&rsquo;s two or</p>
<p>three parents who show up at the house.</p>
<p>We only do outdoor parties, obviously.</p>
<p>Two or three of the 10 kids will have masks on, their parents will have masks on, and</p>
<p>like the most intense N95, like sealed masks.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, you want to take your mask off for a picture?</p>
<p>And one of the kids refused to take her mask off for a picture outside at a birthday party.</p>
<p>I was like, okay.</p>
<p>Listen, I mean, when I supported the mask mandate at the very beginning of the pandemic,</p>
<p>it was always as an interim measure.</p>
<p>If I had known that people would want to continue this thing forever, there&rsquo;s no way I would</p>
<p>have supported it.</p>
<p>But it also probably was effective in the early days with the first vaccine.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think we know what the psychological impact to children is when they don&rsquo;t understand</p>
<p>other people&rsquo;s emotions, and you do it over a long period of time.</p>
<p>No, we don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a fair statement.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know the impact.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s probably not zero.</p>
<p>And so at some point, we need to look at the risks, calculate some expected value, and</p>
<p>the people we need to prioritize are those that are the youngest.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve said this before.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, the teachers unions need to understand that calculus.</p>
<p>Parents already understand that calculus.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think the state legislators, governors and the federal bureaucracy yet understands</p>
<p>this calculus.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s time to return to normal.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s time to return.</p>
<p>Sorry.</p>
<p>And on this point, I would like to bring up something.</p>
<p>The ACLU thing, just because I think I would love to get your take on, you know, talking</p>
<p>about civil liberties and freedoms.</p>
<p>There are things that are happening here under our noses every day.</p>
<p>Under Democratic and Republican presidents that to me when I saw this on the ACLU Twitter</p>
<p>feed yesterday was shocking.</p>
<p>Jason, do you want to tee that up?</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>In other news, the CIA has been secretly conducting surveillance programs to capture Americans</p>
<p>private information.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Democratic Senators Wyden and Heinrich sent a letter to Director of the</p>
<p>CIA and the Director of National Intelligence.</p>
<p>The letter called for greater transparency into the CIA&rsquo;s data collection of private</p>
<p>U.S. citizens.</p>
<p>Basically, the CIA used Executive Order 12333, which was signed by Reagan in 1981 to gather</p>
<p>data on U.S. citizens.</p>
<p>The letter notes the program was, quote, entirely outside the statutory framework that Congress</p>
<p>and the public believe govern the collection and without any judicial, congressional or</p>
<p>even executive branch oversight that comes from FISA.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act collection, quote.</p>
<p>What these documents demonstrate is that many of the same concerns that Americans have</p>
<p>about their privacy and civil liberties also apply to how the CIA collects and handles</p>
<p>information under executive order and outside of FISA law.</p>
<p>In particular, these documents reveal serious problems associated with warrantless backdoor</p>
<p>searches of Americans, the same issue that had generated bipartisan concern in the FISA</p>
<p>context.</p>
<p>I mean, where is the mainstream media while they breathlessly run around chasing cancellation</p>
<p>stories?</p>
<p>Where are they to report and to hold accountable this stuff?</p>
<p>And where are politicians in actually doing their job?</p>
<p>But, you know, I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s ever been this kind of overreach that&rsquo;s just constantly</p>
<p>been going on with zero accountability or transparency into it.</p>
<p>You know, the FBI is responsible for domestic laws, right?</p>
<p>And the FBI has a very clear path in which they need to get warrants in order to be able</p>
<p>to surveil U.S. citizens.</p>
<p>And then the fact that we give an agency whose responsibility is actually foreign.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>The CIA is supposed to work only on international, not domestic.</p>
<p>And then to basically spy on its citizens with zero accountability or reporting, it</p>
<p>seems to be a pretty important issue that should at least be discussed, especially in</p>
<p>a world now where executive power just keeps ramping up and ramping up.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s going on?</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s zero transparency or accountability.</p>
<p>If I didn&rsquo;t randomly see this on an ACLU tweet, would we even be talking about this?</p>
<p>Probably not.</p>
<p>And the other thing that&rsquo;s crazy about it is I think the way they get away with this,</p>
<p>and this has been something that the Patriot Act had a similar technique is they, the CIA</p>
<p>and some other organizations will track international people of interest, you know,</p>
<p>money launderers, etc.</p>
<p>And then say, in order to track them, well, anybody they contact in America is fair game</p>
<p>or if they&rsquo;re, you know, and so you can get the metadata from the phone calls and the</p>
<p>emails.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s how a lot of this gets justified.</p>
<p>What this letter seems to say is we just there&rsquo;s a broad scale surveillance program</p>
<p>against US citizens that is indeterminate in scope and scale.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>So we don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>That seems very different than that.</p>
<p>And then in in parallel to this, there was also that announcement that the Department</p>
<p>of Homeland Security is creating this major apparatus, this infrastructure to go after</p>
<p>domestic terrorists.</p>
<p>Well, look, if they mean people who actually like set off bombs or commit real crimes,</p>
<p>fine.</p>
<p>But Chamath, you asked where the media is.</p>
<p>The media is defining routine political dissent as domestic terrorism now.</p>
<p>I mean, you hear this type of threat inflation.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve heard these truckers even described as insurrectionists.</p>
<p>So, you know, how are these programs going to be used is really the question.</p>
<p>You create this massive infrastructure under the executive branch.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve seen that in Washington, this trend towards criminalizing political disagreements</p>
<p>where Democrats, Republicans have been putting their partisans in jail for years.</p>
<p>But are they now going to apply this to political disagreements in the country?</p>
<p>Can they use these powers to go after truckers who are engaging in civil disobedience?</p>
<p>Can they use these surveillance powers to go after somebody who just tweets things on</p>
<p>social media that they don&rsquo;t like?</p>
<p>I mean, these are the open questions.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very scary.</p>
<p>Well, and it&rsquo;s also hard to determine because you might have some people on the right</p>
<p>who are protesting something in a very valid way.</p>
<p>And then you get some whack jobs like the Oath Keepers who are bringing in tons of weapons</p>
<p>outside the D.C. area on January 6th.</p>
<p>So, there is a valid concern here with all those weapons the Oath Keepers brought and</p>
<p>their plans to do a coordinated takeover after they first got in there.</p>
<p>But then you have the other dipshits who are there are probably just there to</p>
<p>have fun and bang drums and support Trump, right?</p>
<p>Do you think these truckers are engaged in an insurrection?</p>
<p>Well, I mean, we don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>I mean, if they if they bring a bunch of guns, then yes, we should have concerns.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t think they are.</p>
<p>The slippery slope is when you have an executive order that is not governed by the standard</p>
<p>guardrails that we use to have checks and balances between these kinds of government</p>
<p>agencies and the people and the elected officials that we elect.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how it basically gets in a really tricky place.</p>
<p>You have let&rsquo;s I&rsquo;m just going to use Justin Trudeau&rsquo;s quote, OK, but replace that person</p>
<p>with any politician in power.</p>
<p>Hey, there&rsquo;s a small fringe minority of people who are on their way here.</p>
<p>They hold unacceptable views.</p>
<p>Well, you know what that person is going to do?</p>
<p>That person is going to want to do everything in their power to basically understand, break</p>
<p>apart and tear up that fringe minority group.</p>
<p>Now, isn&rsquo;t that scary?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>When you have this overheated political rhetoric that describes your political opponents, your</p>
<p>dissenters of the state, yeah, as enemies, as white supremacists,</p>
<p>as Nazis, as insurrectionaries, as domestic terrorists, why wouldn&rsquo;t then the law enforcement</p>
<p>arms of our government then treat them that way?</p>
<p>I mean, does the Department of Homeland Security or the CIA or the FBI, do they understand</p>
<p>that the politicians are just engaging in rhetoric and in threat inflation?</p>
<p>Or will they take that those invocations literally to what we have to investigate and stop these?</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;ve done a Department of Justice done a pretty good job of that.</p>
<p>I just want I just brought this up, because I think it&rsquo;s really important for somebody</p>
<p>in the mainstream media, of which many listen to this podcast.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>You have a responsibility to actually double click into this issue and figure out what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on, please.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>For on behalf of all of us.</p>
<p>By the way, like if you guys look, I mean, Wall Street Journal, New York Times, BBC,</p>
<p>everyone covered it today.</p>
<p>But the story today is that lawmakers made this claim with no details and no evidence.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m sure the investigations are underway.</p>
<p>I mean, the journalists are clearly leaning in to identify, you know, the evidence behind</p>
<p>the story, and I&rsquo;m sure more will come out over the coming days and weeks.</p>
<p>And in fairness, like you said, is the Justice Department doing this even handedly,</p>
<p>they were very specific with the January 6 Interactions Acts where they went after</p>
<p>Oath Keepers because they had a coordinated, they&rsquo;re a militia, they literally refer to</p>
<p>themselves as a militia.</p>
<p>And those people are getting treated very different than the people who broke glass</p>
<p>or sat on Pence Pelosi&rsquo;s desk, those people are getting three months suspended sentences,</p>
<p>six months sentences.</p>
<p>And the Oath Keepers, who are a militia, they call themselves a militia, they&rsquo;re dangerous,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re treating them very differently.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re the only ones who are being charged with the more serious 10 to 20 year sentences.</p>
<p>So I would say they are doing a great job.</p>
<p>All right, everybody, this has been an amazing journey from Truckers to Joe Rogan and all</p>
<p>the way to Uranus and back for the Rain Man, David Sacks, the Sultan of Science, David</p>
<p>Berg, and the benevolent dictator, they live for the outro, people love it.</p>
<p>Love you, boys.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll see you all next time on the online podcast.</p>
<p>Bye-bye.</p>
<p>Love you, besties.</p>
<p>What what your winners like?</p>
<p>We should all just get a room and just have one big huge orgy because they&rsquo;re all just</p>
<p>useless.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like this like sexual tension that they just need to release somehow.</p>
<p>What your B?</p>
<p>We need to get merch.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going all in.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going all in.</p>
