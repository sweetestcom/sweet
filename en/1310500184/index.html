    <p>The following is a conversation with Jeremy Suri,</p>
<p>a historian at UT Austin,</p>
<p>whose research interests and writing</p>
<p>are on modern American history</p>
<p>with an eye towards presidents</p>
<p>and in general individuals who wielded power.</p>
<p>Quick mention of our sponsors,</p>
<p>Element, Monk Pack, Belcampo, Four Sigmatic, and Eight Sleep.</p>
<p>Check them out in the description to support this podcast.</p>
<p>As a side note, let me say that in these conversations,</p>
<p>for better or worse, I seek understanding, not activism.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not left nor right.</p>
<p>I love ideas, not labels.</p>
<p>And most fascinating ideas are full of uncertainty,</p>
<p>tension, and trade offs.</p>
<p>Labels destroy that.</p>
<p>I try ideas out, let them breathe for a time,</p>
<p>try to challenge, explore, and analyze.</p>
<p>But mostly, I trust the intelligence of you, the listener,</p>
<p>to think and to make up your own mind, together with me.</p>
<p>I will try to have economists and philosophers on</p>
<p>from all points on the multidimensional political spectrum,</p>
<p>including the extremes.</p>
<p>I will try to both have an open mind</p>
<p>and to ask difficult questions when needed.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll make mistakes.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t shoot this robot at the first sign of failure.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still under development.</p>
<p>Pre release version 0.1.</p>
<p>This is the Lex Friedman podcast,</p>
<p>and here is my conversation with Jeremy Suri.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve studied many American presidents throughout history,</p>
<p>so who do you think was the greatest president</p>
<p>in American history?</p>
<p>The greatest American president was Abraham Lincoln.</p>
<p>And Tolstoy reflected on this himself, actually,</p>
<p>saying that when he was in the caucuses,</p>
<p>he asked these peasants in the caucuses</p>
<p>who was the greatest man in the world that they had heard of,</p>
<p>and they said Abraham Lincoln.</p>
<p>And why?</p>
<p>Well, because he gave voice to people</p>
<p>who had no voice before.</p>
<p>He turned politics into an art.</p>
<p>This is what Tolstoy recounted,</p>
<p>the peasants in the caucuses telling him.</p>
<p>Lincoln made politics more than about power.</p>
<p>He made it an art.</p>
<p>He made it a source of liberation.</p>
<p>And those living even far from the United States</p>
<p>could see that model, that inspiration from Lincoln.</p>
<p>He was a man who had two years of education,</p>
<p>yet he mastered the English language,</p>
<p>and he used the language</p>
<p>to help people imagine a different kind of world.</p>
<p>You see, leaders and presidents are at their best</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re doing more</p>
<p>than just manipulating institutions and power,</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re helping the people imagine a better world.</p>
<p>And he did that as no other president has.</p>
<p>And you say he gave voice to those who are voiceless.</p>
<p>Who are you talking to about in general?</p>
<p>Is this about African Americans,</p>
<p>or is this about just the populace in general?</p>
<p>Certainly part of it is about slaves, African Americans,</p>
<p>and many immigrants,</p>
<p>immigrants from all parts of Europe and other areas</p>
<p>that have come to the United States.</p>
<p>But part of it was just for ordinary American citizens.</p>
<p>The Republican Party,</p>
<p>for which Lincoln was the first president,</p>
<p>was a party created to give voice to poor white men,</p>
<p>as well as slaves and others.</p>
<p>And Lincoln was a poor white man himself,</p>
<p>grew up without slaves and without land,</p>
<p>which meant you had almost nothing.</p>
<p>What do you think about the trajectory of that man</p>
<p>with only two years of education?</p>
<p>Is there something to be said</p>
<p>about how does one come from nothing</p>
<p>and nurture the ideals that kind of make this country great</p>
<p>into something where you can actually be a leader</p>
<p>of this nation to espouse those ideas,</p>
<p>to give the voice to the voiceless?</p>
<p>Yes, I think you actually hit the nail on the head.</p>
<p>I think what he represented was the opportunity,</p>
<p>and that was the word that mattered for him,</p>
<p>opportunity that came from the ability to raise yourself up,</p>
<p>to work hard, and to be compensated for your hard work.</p>
<p>And this is at the core of the Republican Party</p>
<p>of the 19th century, which is the core of capitalism.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not about getting rich.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about getting compensated for your work.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about being incentivized to do better work.</p>
<p>And Lincoln was constantly striving.</p>
<p>One of his closest associates, Herndon, said,</p>
<p>he was the little engine of ambition that couldn&rsquo;t stop.</p>
<p>He just kept going, taught himself to read,</p>
<p>taught himself to be a lawyer.</p>
<p>He went through many failed businesses</p>
<p>before he even reached that point, many failed love affairs.</p>
<p>But he kept trying, he kept working,</p>
<p>and what American society offered him,</p>
<p>and what he wanted American society to offer everyone else</p>
<p>was the opportunity to keep trying to fail</p>
<p>and then get up and try again.</p>
<p>What do you think was the nature of that ambition?</p>
<p>Was there a hunger for power?</p>
<p>I think Lincoln had a hunger for success.</p>
<p>I think he had a hunger to get out</p>
<p>of the poor station he was in.</p>
<p>He had a hunger to be someone</p>
<p>who had control over his life.</p>
<p>Freedom for him did not mean the right</p>
<p>to do anything you wanna do,</p>
<p>but it meant the right to be secure</p>
<p>from being dependent upon someone else.</p>
<p>So independence, he writes in his letters</p>
<p>when he&rsquo;s very young that he hated</p>
<p>being dependent on his father.</p>
<p>He grew up without a mother.</p>
<p>His father was a struggling farmer,</p>
<p>and he would write in his letters</p>
<p>that his father treated him like a slave on the farm.</p>
<p>Some think his hatred of slavery came from that experience.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t ever wanna have to work for someone again.</p>
<p>He wanted to be free and independent,</p>
<p>and he wanted, again, every American,</p>
<p>this is the kind of Jeffersonian dream,</p>
<p>to be the owner of themself and the owner of their future.</p>
<p>You know, that&rsquo;s a really nice definition of freedom.</p>
<p>We often think kind of this very abstract notion</p>
<p>of being able to do anything you want,</p>
<p>but really, it&rsquo;s ultimately breaking yourself free</p>
<p>from the constraints, like the very tight dependence</p>
<p>on whether it&rsquo;s the institutions or on your family</p>
<p>or the expectations or the community or whatever,</p>
<p>being able to be, to realize yourself</p>
<p>within the constraints of your own abilities.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s still not true freedom,</p>
<p>because true freedom is probably sort of</p>
<p>almost like designing a video game character,</p>
<p>something like that.</p>
<p>I agree, I think that&rsquo;s exactly right.</p>
<p>I think freedom is not that I can have any outcome I want.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t control outcomes.</p>
<p>The most powerful, freest person in the world</p>
<p>cannot control outcomes,</p>
<p>but it means at least I get to make choices.</p>
<p>Someone else doesn&rsquo;t make those choices for me.</p>
<p>Is there something to be said about Lincoln</p>
<p>on the political game front of it,</p>
<p>which is he&rsquo;s accomplished some of them?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, but it seems like</p>
<p>there was some tricky politics going on.</p>
<p>We tend to not think of it in those terms</p>
<p>because of the dark aspects of slavery.</p>
<p>We tend to think about it in sort of ethical and human terms,</p>
<p>but in their time, it was probably</p>
<p>as much a game of politics,</p>
<p>not just these broad questions of human nature, right?</p>
<p>It was a game.</p>
<p>So is there something to be said</p>
<p>about being a skillful player in the game of politics</p>
<p>that you take from Lincoln?</p>
<p>Absolutely, and Lincoln never read Karl von Clausewitz,</p>
<p>the great 19th century German thinker</p>
<p>on strategy and politics,</p>
<p>but he embodied the same wisdom,</p>
<p>which is that everything is politics.</p>
<p>If you want to get anything done,</p>
<p>and this includes even relationships,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a politics to it.</p>
<p>What does that mean?</p>
<p>It means that you have to persuade, coerce,</p>
<p>encourage people to do things they wouldn&rsquo;t otherwise do.</p>
<p>And Lincoln was a master at that.</p>
<p>He was a master at that for two reasons.</p>
<p>He had learned through his hard life to read people,</p>
<p>to anticipate them, to spend a lot of time listening.</p>
<p>One thing I often tell people</p>
<p>is the best leaders are the listeners, not the talkers.</p>
<p>And then second, Lincoln was very thoughtful</p>
<p>and planned every move out.</p>
<p>He was thinking three or four moves,</p>
<p>maybe five moves down the chessboard,</p>
<p>while others were move number one or two.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fascinating to think about him just listening,</p>
<p>just studying.</p>
<p>They look at great fighters in this way,</p>
<p>like the first few rounds of boxing and mixed martial arts,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re studying the movement of your opponent</p>
<p>in order to sort of define the holes.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a really interesting frame to think about it.</p>
<p>Is there, in terms of relationships,</p>
<p>where do you think as president or as a politician</p>
<p>is the most impact to be had?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been reading a lot about Hitler recently,</p>
<p>and one of the things that I&rsquo;m more and more starting</p>
<p>to wonder, what the hell did he do alone in a room</p>
<p>with one on one with people?</p>
<p>Because it seems like that&rsquo;s where</p>
<p>he was exceptionally effective.</p>
<p>When I think about certain leaders,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure Stalin was this way, I apologize.</p>
<p>Been very obsessed with this period of human history.</p>
<p>It just seems like certain leaders</p>
<p>are extremely effective one on one.</p>
<p>A lot of people think of Hitler in Lincoln</p>
<p>as a speech maker, as a great charismatic speech maker,</p>
<p>but it seems like to me that some of these guys</p>
<p>were really effective inside a room.</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s more important?</p>
<p>Your effectiveness to make a hell of a good speech,</p>
<p>sort of being in a room with many people,</p>
<p>or is it all boiled down to one on one?</p>
<p>Well, I think in a sense, it&rsquo;s both.</p>
<p>One needs to do both, and most politicians,</p>
<p>most leaders are better at one or the other.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the rare leader who can do both.</p>
<p>I will say that if you are going to be a figure</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s a president or the leader of a complex organization,</p>
<p>not a startup, but a complex organization</p>
<p>where you have many different constituencies</p>
<p>and many different interests,</p>
<p>you have to do the one on one really well,</p>
<p>because a lot of what&rsquo;s going to happen</p>
<p>is you&rsquo;re going to be meeting with people</p>
<p>who represent different groups, right?</p>
<p>The leader of the labor unions,</p>
<p>the leader of your investing board, et cetera,</p>
<p>and you have to be able to persuade them,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s the intangibles that often matter most.</p>
<p>Lincoln&rsquo;s skill, and it&rsquo;s the same that FDR had,</p>
<p>is the ability to tell a story.</p>
<p>I think Hitler was a little different,</p>
<p>but what I&rsquo;ve read of Stalin is he was a storyteller too.</p>
<p>One on one storyteller?</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s my understanding is that he,</p>
<p>and what Lincoln did,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to compare Lincoln to Stalin,</p>
<p>but what Lincoln did is he was not confrontational.</p>
<p>He was happy to have an argument</p>
<p>if an argument were to be had,</p>
<p>but actually what he would try to do</p>
<p>is move you through telling a story</p>
<p>that got you to think about your position in a different way,</p>
<p>to basically disarm you.</p>
<p>And Franklin Roosevelt did the same thing.</p>
<p>Ronald Reagan did the same thing.</p>
<p>Storytelling is a very important skill.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost heartbreaking that we don&rsquo;t get to have,</p>
<p>or maybe you can correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong on this,</p>
<p>but it feels like we don&rsquo;t have a lot of information</p>
<p>how all of these folks were in private,</p>
<p>one on one conversations.</p>
<p>Even if we get stories about it,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, again, sorry to bring up Hitler,</p>
<p>but people have talked about his piercing gaze</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re one on one.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a feeling like he&rsquo;s just looking through you.</p>
<p>I wonder, it makes me wonder,</p>
<p>was Lincoln somebody who was a little bit more passive,</p>
<p>like who&rsquo;s more, the ego doesn&rsquo;t shine.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like an overwhelming thing,</p>
<p>or is it more like, again,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t want to bring up controversial figures,</p>
<p>but Donald Trump, where it&rsquo;s more menacing, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a more like physically menacing thing,</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s almost like a bullying kind of dynamic.</p>
<p>So I wonder, I wish we knew.</p>
<p>Because from a psychological perspective,</p>
<p>I wonder if there&rsquo;s a thread</p>
<p>that connects most great leaders.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a great question.</p>
<p>So I think the best writer on this is Max Weber, right?</p>
<p>And he talks about the power of charisma,</p>
<p>that the term charisma comes from Weber, right?</p>
<p>And Weber&rsquo;s use of it actually to talk about profits.</p>
<p>And I think he has a point, right?</p>
<p>Leaders who are effective in the way you describe</p>
<p>are leaders who feel prophetic,</p>
<p>or Weber says they have a kind of magic about them.</p>
<p>And I think that can come from different sources.</p>
<p>I think that can come from the way someone</p>
<p>carries themselves.</p>
<p>It can come from the way they use words.</p>
<p>So maybe there are different kinds of magic</p>
<p>that someone develops.</p>
<p>But I think there are two things</p>
<p>that seem to be absolutely necessary.</p>
<p>First is you have to be someone who sizes up the person</p>
<p>on the other side of the table.</p>
<p>You cannot be the person who just comes in</p>
<p>and reads your brief.</p>
<p>And then second, I think it&rsquo;s interactive.</p>
<p>And there is a quickness of thought.</p>
<p>So you brought up Donald Trump.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think Donald Trump is a deep thinker at all,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s quick.</p>
<p>And I think that quickness is part of,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s different from delivering a lecture</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s the depth of your thought.</p>
<p>Can you for 45 minutes analyze something?</p>
<p>Many people can&rsquo;t do that,</p>
<p>but they still might be very effective</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re able to quickly react,</p>
<p>size up the person on the other side of the table</p>
<p>and react in a way that moves that person</p>
<p>in the way they wanna move them.</p>
<p>Yeah, and there&rsquo;s also just coupled with the quickness</p>
<p>as a kind of instinct about human nature.</p>
<p>Sort of asking the question,</p>
<p>what does this person worry about?</p>
<p>What are the biggest problems?</p>
<p>Somebody, what is this, Stephen Schwartzman, I think,</p>
<p>said to me, he&rsquo;s this businessman.</p>
<p>I think he said like, what I&rsquo;ve always tried to do</p>
<p>is try to figure out, like ask enough questions</p>
<p>to figure out what is the biggest problem</p>
<p>in this person&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>Try to get a sense of what is the biggest problem</p>
<p>in their life, because that&rsquo;s actually</p>
<p>what they care about most.</p>
<p>And most people don&rsquo;t care enough to find out.</p>
<p>And so he kind of wants to sneak up on that</p>
<p>and find that, and then use that to then build closeness</p>
<p>in order to then probably, he doesn&rsquo;t put it in those words,</p>
<p>but to manipulate the person into whatever,</p>
<p>to do whatever the heck they want.</p>
<p>And I think part of it is that,</p>
<p>and part of the effect that Donald Trump has</p>
<p>is how quick he&rsquo;s able to figure that out.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve written a book about how the role</p>
<p>and power of the presidency has changed.</p>
<p>So how has it changed since Lincoln&rsquo;s time,</p>
<p>the evolution of the presidency as a concept,</p>
<p>which seems like a fascinating lens</p>
<p>through which to look at American history.</p>
<p>As a president, we seem to only be talking</p>
<p>about the presidents, maybe a general here and there,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s mostly the story of America is often told</p>
<p>through presidents.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>And one of the points I&rsquo;ve tried to make</p>
<p>in my writing about this and various other activities</p>
<p>is we use this word president as if it&rsquo;s something timeless,</p>
<p>but the office has changed incredibly.</p>
<p>Just from Lincoln&rsquo;s time to the present,</p>
<p>which is 150 years, he wouldn&rsquo;t recognize the office today.</p>
<p>And George Washington would not have recognized it</p>
<p>in Lincoln, just as I think a CEO today</p>
<p>would be unrecognizable to a Rockefeller</p>
<p>or a Carnegie of 150 years ago.</p>
<p>So what are some of the ways in which the office has changed?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just point to three, there are a lot.</p>
<p>One, presidents now can communicate with the public directly.</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;ve reached the point now</p>
<p>where a president can have direct,</p>
<p>almost one on one communication.</p>
<p>President can use Twitter if he so chooses</p>
<p>to circumvent all media.</p>
<p>That was unthinkable.</p>
<p>Lincoln, in order to get his message across,</p>
<p>often wrote letters to newspapers.</p>
<p>And waited for the newspaper for Horace Greeley</p>
<p>in the New York Tribune to publish his letter.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how he communicated with the public.</p>
<p>There weren&rsquo;t even many speaking opportunities.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a big change, right?</p>
<p>We feel the president in our life much more.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why we talk about him much more.</p>
<p>That also creates more of a burden.</p>
<p>This is the second point.</p>
<p>Presidents are under a microscope.</p>
<p>You have to be very careful what you do and what you say.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re judged by a lot of the elements of your behavior</p>
<p>that are not policy relevant.</p>
<p>In fact, the things we judge most</p>
<p>and make most of our decisions on about individuals</p>
<p>are often that.</p>
<p>And then third, the power the president has.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s inhuman, actually.</p>
<p>And this is one of my critiques</p>
<p>of how the office has changed.</p>
<p>This one person has power on a scale</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s I think dangerous in a democracy.</p>
<p>And certainly something the founders 220 years ago</p>
<p>would have had trouble conceiving.</p>
<p>Presidents now have the ability to deliver force</p>
<p>across the world to literally assassinate people</p>
<p>with a remarkable accuracy.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s an enormous power that presidents have.</p>
<p>So your sense, this is not to get conspiratorial,</p>
<p>but do you think a president currently has the power</p>
<p>to initiate the assassination of somebody,</p>
<p>of a political enemy or a terrorist leader</p>
<p>or that kind of thing to frame that person in a way</p>
<p>where assassination is something that he alone</p>
<p>or she alone could decide to do?</p>
<p>I think it happens all the time</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not to be conspiratorial.</p>
<p>This is how we fought terrorism by targeting individuals.</p>
<p>Now you might say these were not elected leaders of state,</p>
<p>but these were individuals with a large following.</p>
<p>I mean, the killing of Osama Bin Laden</p>
<p>was an assassination operation.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve taken out very successfully</p>
<p>many leaders of terrorist organizations</p>
<p>and we do it every day.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re saying that back in Lincoln&rsquo;s time</p>
<p>or George Washington&rsquo;s time,</p>
<p>there was more of a balance of power?</p>
<p>Like a president could not initiate</p>
<p>this kind of assassination?</p>
<p>Correct, I think presidents did not have</p>
<p>the same kind of military or economic power.</p>
<p>We could talk about how a president can influence a market</p>
<p>by saying something about where money is gonna go</p>
<p>or singling out a company or critiquing a company</p>
<p>in one way or another.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t have that kind of power.</p>
<p>Now, much of the power that a Lincoln or a Washington had</p>
<p>was the power to mobilize people</p>
<p>to then make their own decisions.</p>
<p>At the start of the Civil War,</p>
<p>Lincoln doesn&rsquo;t even have the power</p>
<p>to bring people into the army.</p>
<p>He has to go to the governors</p>
<p>and ask the governors to provide soldiers.</p>
<p>So the governor of Wisconsin,</p>
<p>the governor of Massachusetts.</p>
<p>Could you imagine that today?</p>
<p>So, but yeah, so they use speeches and words</p>
<p>to mobilize versus direct action in closed door environments,</p>
<p>initiating wars, for example.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s difficult to think about,</p>
<p>if we look at Barack Obama, for example,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re listening to this</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re on the left or the right,</p>
<p>please do not make this political.</p>
<p>In fact, if you&rsquo;re a political person</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re getting angry at the mention of the word Obama</p>
<p>or Donald Trump, please turn off this podcast</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve just described.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not gonna get very far.</p>
<p>I hope we maintain a political discussion</p>
<p>about even the modern presidents</p>
<p>that view through the lens of history.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a lot to be learned</p>
<p>about the office and about human nature.</p>
<p>Some people criticize Barack Obama</p>
<p>for sort of expanding the military industrial complex,</p>
<p>engaging in more and more wars,</p>
<p>as opposed to sort of the initial rhetoric</p>
<p>was such that we would pull back</p>
<p>from sort of be more skeptical</p>
<p>in our decisions to wage wars.</p>
<p>So from the lens of the power of the presidency,</p>
<p>as the modern presidency,</p>
<p>the fact that we continued the war in Afghanistan</p>
<p>and different engagements in military conflicts,</p>
<p>do you think Barack Obama could have stopped that?</p>
<p>Do you put the responsibility on that expansion</p>
<p>on him because of the implied power</p>
<p>that the presidency has?</p>
<p>Or is this power just sits there</p>
<p>and if a president chooses to take it, they do,</p>
<p>and if they don&rsquo;t, they don&rsquo;t?</p>
<p>Almost like you don&rsquo;t want to take on the responsibility</p>
<p>because of the burden of that responsibility.</p>
<p>So a lot of my research is about this exact question,</p>
<p>not just with Obama.</p>
<p>And my conclusion, and I think the research</p>
<p>is pretty clear on this, is that structure</p>
<p>has a lot more effect on us than we like to admit,</p>
<p>which is to say that the circumstances,</p>
<p>the institutions around us drive our behavior</p>
<p>more than we like to think.</p>
<p>So Barack Obama, I&rsquo;m quite certain,</p>
<p>came into the office of the presidency committed</p>
<p>to actually reducing the use of military force overseas</p>
<p>and reducing presidential war making power.</p>
<p>As a trained lawyer, he had a moral position</p>
<p>on this actually, and he tried.</p>
<p>And he did withdraw American forces from Iraq</p>
<p>and was of course criticized by many people for doing that.</p>
<p>But at the same time, he had some real problems</p>
<p>in the world to deal with, terrorism being one of them.</p>
<p>And the tools he has are very much biased</p>
<p>towards the use of military force.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s much harder as president to go and get Vladimir Putin</p>
<p>and Xi Jinping to agree with you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s much easier to send these wonderful toys we have</p>
<p>and these incredible soldiers we have over there.</p>
<p>And when you have Congress, which is always against you,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s also easier to use the military</p>
<p>because you send them there.</p>
<p>And even if members of Congress from your own party</p>
<p>or the other are angry at you,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll still fund the soldiers.</p>
<p>No member of Congress wants to vote</p>
<p>to starve our soldiers overseas.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;ll stop your budget,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll even threaten not to pay the debt,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;ll still fund your soldiers.</p>
<p>And so you are pushed by the circumstances you&rsquo;re in</p>
<p>to do this, and it&rsquo;s very hard to resist.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s, I think the criticism of Obama,</p>
<p>the fair one would be that he didn&rsquo;t resist the pressures</p>
<p>that were there, but he did not make those pressures.</p>
<p>So is there something about putting the responsibility</p>
<p>on the president to form the structure around him locally</p>
<p>such that he can make the policy that matches the rhetoric?</p>
<p>So what I&rsquo;m talking to is hiring.</p>
<p>So basically just everybody you work with,</p>
<p>you have power as a president to fire and hire</p>
<p>or to basically schedule meetings in such a way</p>
<p>that can control your decision making.</p>
<p>So I imagine it&rsquo;s very difficult to get out of Afghanistan</p>
<p>or Iraq when most of your scheduled meetings</p>
<p>are with generals or something like that.</p>
<p>But if you reorganize the schedule</p>
<p>and you reorganize who you have like late night talks with,</p>
<p>you potentially have a huge ripple effect on the policy.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>I think who has access to the president</p>
<p>is absolutely crucial.</p>
<p>And presidents have to be more strategic about that.</p>
<p>They tend to be reacting to crises</p>
<p>because every day has a crisis.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re reacting to a crisis,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not controlling access</p>
<p>because the crisis is driving you.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s one element of it.</p>
<p>But I also think, and this is the moment we&rsquo;re in right now,</p>
<p>presidents have to invest in reforming the system,</p>
<p>the system of decision making.</p>
<p>Should we have a national security council</p>
<p>that looks the way it does?</p>
<p>Should our military be structured the way it is?</p>
<p>The founding fathers wanted a military that was divided.</p>
<p>They did not want a unified department of defense.</p>
<p>That was only created after World War II.</p>
<p>Should we have as large a military as we have?</p>
<p>Should we be in as many places?</p>
<p>There are some fundamental structural reforms</p>
<p>we have to undertake.</p>
<p>And part of that is who you appoint,</p>
<p>but part of that is also how you change the institutions.</p>
<p>The genius of the American system</p>
<p>is that it&rsquo;s a dynamic system.</p>
<p>It can be adjusted.</p>
<p>It has been adjusted over time.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the heroic story.</p>
<p>The frustrating story is it often takes us a long time</p>
<p>to make those adjustments until we go</p>
<p>into such bad circumstances that we have no choice.</p>
<p>So in the battle of power of the office of the president</p>
<p>versus the United States military,</p>
<p>the department of defense,</p>
<p>do you have a sense that the president</p>
<p>has more power ultimately?</p>
<p>So to decrease the size of the department of defense,</p>
<p>to withdraw from any wars,</p>
<p>or increase the amount of wars,</p>
<p>is the president, you&rsquo;re kind of implying</p>
<p>the president has a lot of power here in this scale.</p>
<p>Yes, the president has a lot of power</p>
<p>and we are fortunate and it was just proven</p>
<p>in the last few years that our military,</p>
<p>uniquely among many countries with large militaries,</p>
<p>is very deferential to the president</p>
<p>and very restricted in its ability</p>
<p>to challenge the president.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a strength of our system.</p>
<p>But the way you reform the military</p>
<p>is not with individual decisions.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s by having a strategic plan</p>
<p>that reexamines what role it plays.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not just about whether we&rsquo;re in Afghanistan or not.</p>
<p>The question we have to ask is,</p>
<p>when we look at our toolbox</p>
<p>of what we can do in our foreign policy,</p>
<p>are there other tools we should build up</p>
<p>and therefore some tools in the military we should reduce?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the broader strategic question.</p>
<p>Let me ask you the most absurd question of all</p>
<p>that you did not sign up for,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve been hanging out</p>
<p>with a guy named Joe Rogan recently,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s very important for me and him to figure this out.</p>
<p>If a president, because you said,</p>
<p>you implied the president&rsquo;s very powerful,</p>
<p>if a president shows up and the US government is in fact</p>
<p>in possession of aliens, alien spacecraft,</p>
<p>do you think the president will be told?</p>
<p>A more responsible adult historian question version of that</p>
<p>is, is there some things that the machine of government</p>
<p>keeps secret from the president?</p>
<p>Or is the president ultimately at the very center?</p>
<p>So if you map out the set of information and power,</p>
<p>you have CIA, you have all these organizations</p>
<p>that do the machinery of government,</p>
<p>not just the passing of bills,</p>
<p>but gaining information, homeland security,</p>
<p>actually engaging in wars, all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>How central is the president?</p>
<p>Would the president know some of the shady things</p>
<p>that are going on?</p>
<p>Aliens or some kind of cybersecurity stuff</p>
<p>against Russia and China, all those kinds of things,</p>
<p>is the president really made aware?</p>
<p>And if so, how nervous does that make you?</p>
<p>So presidents like leaders of any complex organizations</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know everything that goes on.</p>
<p>They have to ask the right questions.</p>
<p>This is Machiavelli.</p>
<p>Most important thing a leader has to do</p>
<p>is ask the right questions.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to know the answers.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why you hire smart people,</p>
<p>but you have to ask the right questions.</p>
<p>So if the president asks the US government,</p>
<p>those who are responsible for the aliens</p>
<p>or responsible for the cyber warfare against Russia,</p>
<p>they will answer honestly, they will have to,</p>
<p>but they will not volunteer that information in all cases.</p>
<p>So the best way a president can operate</p>
<p>is to have people around him or her</p>
<p>who are not the traditional policymakers,</p>
<p>this is where I think academic experts are important,</p>
<p>suggesting questions to ask</p>
<p>to therefore try to get the information.</p>
<p>It makes me nervous because I think human nature</p>
<p>is such that the academics, the experts,</p>
<p>everybody is almost afraid to ask the questions</p>
<p>for which the answers might be burdensome.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>And you can get into a lot of trouble not asking,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the old elephant in the room.</p>
<p>Correct, correct.</p>
<p>This is exactly right.</p>
<p>And too often mediocre leaders</p>
<p>and those who try to protect them try to shield themselves.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t want to know certain things.</p>
<p>So this is part of what happened</p>
<p>with the use of torture by the United States,</p>
<p>which is a war crime during the war on terror.</p>
<p>President Bush at times intentionally did not ask</p>
<p>and people around him prevented him from asking</p>
<p>or discouraged him from asking questions</p>
<p>he should have asked to know about what was going on.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s how we ended up where we did.</p>
<p>You could say the same thing about Reagan and Iran Contra.</p>
<p>I wonder what it takes to be the kind of leader</p>
<p>that steps in and asks some difficult questions.</p>
<p>So aliens is one, UFO spacecraft, right?</p>
<p>Another one, yeah, torture is another one.</p>
<p>The CIA, how much information</p>
<p>is being collected about Americans?</p>
<p>I can see as a president being very uncomfortable</p>
<p>asking that question.</p>
<p>Because if the answer is a lot of information</p>
<p>is being collected by Americans,</p>
<p>then you have to be the guy</p>
<p>who lives with that information.</p>
<p>For the rest of your life, you have to walk around.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re probably not going to reform that system.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very difficult.</p>
<p>You probably have to be very picky</p>
<p>about which things you reform.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have much time.</p>
<p>It takes a lot of sort of effort to restructure things.</p>
<p>But you nevertheless would have to be basically lying</p>
<p>to yourself, to others around you</p>
<p>about the unethical things.</p>
<p>Depends of course what your ethical system is.</p>
<p>I wonder what it takes to ask those hard questions.</p>
<p>I wonder if how few of us can be great leaders like that.</p>
<p>And I wonder if our political system, the electoral system</p>
<p>is such that makes it likely</p>
<p>that such leaders will come to power.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard and you can&rsquo;t ask all the right questions</p>
<p>and there is a legal hazard if you know things</p>
<p>at certain times.</p>
<p>But I think you can, back to your point on hiring,</p>
<p>you can hire people who will do that in their domains.</p>
<p>And then you have to trust that when they think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s a question you need to ask,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll pass that on to you.</p>
<p>This is why it&rsquo;s not a good idea to have loyalists</p>
<p>because loyalists will shield you from things.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good idea to have people of integrity</p>
<p>who you can rely on and who you think will ask</p>
<p>those right questions and then pass that down</p>
<p>through their organization.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s inspiring to you, what&rsquo;s insightful to you</p>
<p>about several of the presidencies</p>
<p>throughout the recent decades?</p>
<p>Is there somebody that stands out to you</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s interesting and sort of in your study</p>
<p>of how the office has changed?</p>
<p>Well, Bill Clinton is one of the most fascinating figures.</p>
<p>Why can&rsquo;t I, I apologize.</p>
<p>Bill Clinton just puts a smile on my face</p>
<p>every time somebody mentions him at this point.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why.</p>
<p>I guess it&rsquo;s charisma, I suppose.</p>
<p>Well, and he&rsquo;s a unique individual,</p>
<p>but he fascinates me because he&rsquo;s a figure</p>
<p>of such enormous talent and enormous appetite</p>
<p>and such little self control and such extremes.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s not just that he tells us</p>
<p>something about the presidency,</p>
<p>he tells us something about our society.</p>
<p>American society, this is not new to our time,</p>
<p>is filled with enormous reservoirs of talent and creativity.</p>
<p>And those have a bright and a dark side.</p>
<p>And you see both with Bill Clinton.</p>
<p>In some ways, he&rsquo;s the mirror of the best and worst</p>
<p>of our society.</p>
<p>And maybe that&rsquo;s really what presidents are in the end.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re mirrors of our world</p>
<p>that we get the government we deserve,</p>
<p>we get the leaders we deserve.</p>
<p>I wish we embraced that a little bit more.</p>
<p>A lot of people criticize Donald Trump</p>
<p>for certain human qualities that he has.</p>
<p>A lot of people criticize Bill Clinton</p>
<p>for certain human qualities.</p>
<p>I wish we kind of embraced the chaos of that.</p>
<p>Because he does, you&rsquo;re right, in some sense represent,</p>
<p>I mean, he doesn&rsquo;t represent the greatest ideal of America,</p>
<p>but the flawed aspect of human nature is what he represents.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the beautiful thing about America,</p>
<p>the diversity of this land with the mix of it,</p>
<p>the corruption within capitalism,</p>
<p>the beauty of capitalism, the innovation,</p>
<p>all those kinds of things,</p>
<p>the people that start from nothing and create everything,</p>
<p>the Elon Musk&rsquo;s of the world and the Bill Gates and so on.</p>
<p>But also the people, Bernie Mados and all,</p>
<p>as the Me Too movement has showed the multitude of creeps</p>
<p>that apparently permeate the entirety of our system.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know, there is something, there is some sense</p>
<p>in which we put our president on a pedestal,</p>
<p>which actually creates a fake human being.</p>
<p>Like the standard we hold them to</p>
<p>is forcing the fake politicians to come to power</p>
<p>versus the authentic one, which is in some sense,</p>
<p>the promise of Donald Trump is like,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a definitive statement of authenticity.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, this is the opposite of the fake politician.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s whatever else you wanna say about him</p>
<p>is there&rsquo;s the chaos that&rsquo;s unlike anything else</p>
<p>that came before.</p>
<p>One thing, and this is a particular maybe preference</p>
<p>and quirk of mine, but I really admire,</p>
<p>maybe I&rsquo;m romanticizing the past again,</p>
<p>but I romanticize the presidents</p>
<p>that were students of history.</p>
<p>They were almost like king philosophers,</p>
<p>that made speeches that reverberated through decades after.</p>
<p>Using the words of those presidents,</p>
<p>whether written by them or not,</p>
<p>we tell the story of America.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know, even Obama has been an exceptionally good,</p>
<p>as far as I know, I apologize if I&rsquo;m incorrect on this,</p>
<p>but from everything I&rsquo;ve seen,</p>
<p>he was a very deep scholar of history.</p>
<p>And I really admire that.</p>
<p>Is that through the history of the office of the presidency,</p>
<p>is that just your own preference</p>
<p>or is that supposed to come with the job?</p>
<p>Are you supposed to be a student of history?</p>
<p>I think, I mean, I&rsquo;m obviously biased as a historian,</p>
<p>but I do think it comes with the job.</p>
<p>Every president I&rsquo;ve studied had a serious interest</p>
<p>in history.</p>
<p>Now, how they pursued that interest would vary.</p>
<p>Obama was more bookish, more academic.</p>
<p>So was George W. Bush in strange ways.</p>
<p>George H. W. Bush was less so,</p>
<p>but George H. W. Bush loved to talk to people.</p>
<p>So he would talk to historians, right?</p>
<p>Ronald Reagan loved movies</p>
<p>and movies were an insight into history for him.</p>
<p>He likes to watch movies about another time.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t always the best of history,</p>
<p>but he was interested</p>
<p>in what is a fundamental historical question.</p>
<p>How has our society developed?</p>
<p>How has it grown and changed over time?</p>
<p>And how has that change affected who we are today?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the historical question.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really interesting to me.</p>
<p>I do a lot of work with business leaders and others too.</p>
<p>You reach a certain point in any career</p>
<p>and you become a historian</p>
<p>because you realize that the formulas</p>
<p>and the technical knowledge that you&rsquo;ve gained</p>
<p>got you to where you are.</p>
<p>But now your decisions are about human nature.</p>
<p>Your decisions are about social change</p>
<p>and they can&rsquo;t be answered technically.</p>
<p>They can only be answered by studying human beings.</p>
<p>And what is history?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s studying the laboratory of human behavior.</p>
<p>To sort of play devil&rsquo;s advocate,</p>
<p>I kind of, especially in the engineering scientific domains,</p>
<p>I often see history holding us back.</p>
<p>Sort of the way things were done in the past</p>
<p>are not necessarily going to hold the key</p>
<p>to what will progress us into the future.</p>
<p>Of course, with history in studying human nature,</p>
<p>it does seem like humans are just the same.</p>
<p>She has like the same problems over and over.</p>
<p>So in that sense, it feels like history has all the lessons,</p>
<p>whether we&rsquo;re talking about wars,</p>
<p>whether we&rsquo;re talking about corruption,</p>
<p>whether we&rsquo;re talking about economics.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a difference between</p>
<p>history and antiquarianism.</p>
<p>So antiquarianism, which some people call history,</p>
<p>is the desire to go back to the past</p>
<p>or stay stuck in the past.</p>
<p>So antiquarianism is the desire to have the desk</p>
<p>that Abraham Lincoln sat at.</p>
<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t it be cool to sit at his desk?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to have that desk.</p>
<p>If I had a few extra million dollars, I&rsquo;d acquire it.</p>
<p>So in a way, that&rsquo;s antiquarianism.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s trying to capture and hold on to the past.</p>
<p>The past is a talisman for antiquarians.</p>
<p>What history is, is the study of change over time.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the real definition of historical study</p>
<p>and historical thinking.</p>
<p>And so what we&rsquo;re studying is change.</p>
<p>And so a historian should never say,</p>
<p>we have to do things the way we&rsquo;ve done them in the past.</p>
<p>The historian should say, we can&rsquo;t do them</p>
<p>the way we did them in the past.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t step in the same river twice.</p>
<p>Every podcast of yours is different from the last one.</p>
<p>You plan it out and then it goes in its own direction.</p>
<p>And what are we studying then in history?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re studying the patterns of change</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re recognizing we&rsquo;re part of a pattern.</p>
<p>So what I would say to the historian</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s trying to hold the engineer back,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say, no, don&rsquo;t tell that engineer not to do this.</p>
<p>Tell them to understand how this fits</p>
<p>into the relationship with other engineering products</p>
<p>and other activities from the past</p>
<p>that still affect us today.</p>
<p>For example, any product you produce</p>
<p>is gonna be used by human beings who have prejudices.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna go into an unequal society.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t assume it&rsquo;s gonna go into an equal society.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t assume that when you create a social media site</p>
<p>that people are going to use it fairly</p>
<p>and put only truthful things on it.</p>
<p>We shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where human nature comes in.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not trying to hold onto the past.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s trying to use the knowledge from the past</p>
<p>to better inform the changes today.</p>
<p>I have to ask you about George Washington.</p>
<p>Maybe you have some insights.</p>
<p>It seems like he&rsquo;s such a fascinating figure</p>
<p>in the context of the study of power.</p>
<p>Because I kind of intuitively have come to internalize</p>
<p>the belief that power corrupts</p>
<p>and absolute power corrupts absolutely.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And sort of like basically in thinking</p>
<p>that we cannot trust any one individual.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t trust myself with power.</p>
<p>Nobody can trust anybody with power.</p>
<p>We have to create institutions and structures</p>
<p>that prevent us from ever being able</p>
<p>to amass absolute power.</p>
<p>And yet, here&rsquo;s a guy, George Washington,</p>
<p>who seems to, you can correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong,</p>
<p>but he seems to give away, relinquish power.</p>
<p>It feels like George Washington did it</p>
<p>almost like the purest of ways,</p>
<p>which is believes in this country,</p>
<p>but he just believes he&rsquo;s not the person</p>
<p>to carry it forward.</p>
<p>What do you make of that?</p>
<p>What kind of human does it take to give away that power?</p>
<p>Is there some hopeful message we can carry through</p>
<p>to the future to elect leaders like that</p>
<p>or to find friends to hang out with who are like that?</p>
<p>Like what is that?</p>
<p>How do you explain that?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s actually the most important thing</p>
<p>about George Washington.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the right thing to bring up.</p>
<p>What the historian Gary Wills wrote years ago,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna quote him,</p>
<p>was that Washington recognized</p>
<p>that sometimes you get more power by giving it up</p>
<p>than by trying to hold on to every last piece of it.</p>
<p>Washington gives up power at the end of the revolution.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s successfully carried</p>
<p>through the revolutionary war aims.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s commander of the revolutionary forces</p>
<p>and he gives up his command.</p>
<p>And then of course he&rsquo;s president</p>
<p>and after two terms, he gives up his command.</p>
<p>What is he doing?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s an ambitious person,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s recognizing that the most important currency</p>
<p>he has for power is his respected status</p>
<p>as a disinterested statesman.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really what his power is.</p>
<p>And how does he further that power?</p>
<p>By showing that he doesn&rsquo;t crave power.</p>
<p>So he was self aware.</p>
<p>Very self aware of this</p>
<p>and very sophisticated in understanding this.</p>
<p>And I think there are many other leaders who recognize that.</p>
<p>You can look to, in some ways,</p>
<p>the story of many of our presidents</p>
<p>who even before there is a two term limit</p>
<p>in the constitution, leave after two terms.</p>
<p>They do that because they recognize</p>
<p>that their power is the power of being a statesman,</p>
<p>not of being a president.</p>
<p>I still wonder what kind of man it takes,</p>
<p>what kind of human being it takes to do that.</p>
<p>Because I&rsquo;ve been studying Vladimir Putin quite a bit.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s still, I believe he still has popular support</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s not fully manipulated.</p>
<p>Because I know a lot of people in Russia</p>
<p>and actually almost the entirety of my family in Russia</p>
<p>are big supporters of Putin.</p>
<p>And everybody I talk to sort of,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not just like on social media.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Like the people that live in Russia</p>
<p>seem to support him.</p>
<p>It feels like this will be in a George Washington way.</p>
<p>Now will be the time that Putin,</p>
<p>just like Yeltsin, could relinquish power.</p>
<p>And thereby, in the eyes of Russians,</p>
<p>become, in like the long arc of history,</p>
<p>be viewed as a great leader.</p>
<p>You look at the economic growth of Russia,</p>
<p>you look at the rescue from the collapse</p>
<p>of the Soviet Union and Russia finding its footing,</p>
<p>and then relinquishing power in a way that perhaps,</p>
<p>if Russia succeeds, forms a truly democratic state.</p>
<p>This would be how Putin can become</p>
<p>one of the great leaders in Russian history,</p>
<p>at least in the context of the 21st century.</p>
<p>I think there are two reasons why this is really hard</p>
<p>for Putin and for others.</p>
<p>One is the trappings of power are very seductive,</p>
<p>as you said before, they&rsquo;re corrupting.</p>
<p>This is a real problem, right?</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s in the business context,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t wanna give up that private jet.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s in Putin&rsquo;s context,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s billions of dollars every year</p>
<p>that he&rsquo;s able to take for himself or give to his friends.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that he&rsquo;ll be poor if he leaves,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;ll still be rich,</p>
<p>and he has billions of dollars stored away,</p>
<p>but he won&rsquo;t be able to get the new billions.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s part of it,</p>
<p>the trappings of power are a big deal.</p>
<p>And then second, in Putin&rsquo;s case in particular,</p>
<p>he has to be worried about what happens next.</p>
<p>Will he be tried?</p>
<p>Will someone try to come and arrest him?</p>
<p>Will someone try to come and assassinate him?</p>
<p>Washington recognized that leaving early</p>
<p>limited the corruption and limited the enemies that you made.</p>
<p>And so it was a strategic choice.</p>
<p>Putin is at this point bringing power too long.</p>
<p>And this comes back to your core insight.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a cliche, but it&rsquo;s true, power corrupts.</p>
<p>No one should have power for too long.</p>
<p>This was one of the best insights</p>
<p>the founders of the United States had,</p>
<p>that power was to be held for a short time</p>
<p>as a fiduciary responsibility,</p>
<p>not as something you owned, right?</p>
<p>This is the problem with monarchy,</p>
<p>with aristocracy, that you own power, right?</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t own power, we&rsquo;re holding it in trust.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s some probably like very specific</p>
<p>psychological study of how many years it takes</p>
<p>for you to forget that you can&rsquo;t own power.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>That could be a much more rigorous discussion</p>
<p>about the length of terms that are appropriate,</p>
<p>but really there&rsquo;s an amount,</p>
<p>like Stalin had power for 30 years,</p>
<p>like Putin is pushing those that many years already.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a certain point where you forget</p>
<p>the person you were before you took the power.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>You forget to be humble in the face of this responsibility</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s no going back.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s how dictators are born.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how the evil like authoritarians become evil</p>
<p>or let&rsquo;s not use the word evil,</p>
<p>but counterproductive, destructive</p>
<p>to the ideal that they initially</p>
<p>probably came to office with.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>One of the core historical insights</p>
<p>is people should move jobs.</p>
<p>And this applies for CEOs probably.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>They can go become CEO somewhere else,</p>
<p>but don&rsquo;t stay CEO one place too long.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a problem with startups, right?</p>
<p>The founder, you can have a brilliant founder</p>
<p>and that founder doesn&rsquo;t want to let go.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Right, it&rsquo;s the same issue.</p>
<p>At the same time, I mean, this is where Elon Musk</p>
<p>and a few others like Larry Page and Sergey Brin</p>
<p>that stayed for quite a long time</p>
<p>and they actually were the beacon.</p>
<p>They, on their shoulders, carried the dream of the company</p>
<p>where everybody else doubted.</p>
<p>But that seems to be the exception versus the rule.</p>
<p>Well, and even Sergey, for example, has stepped back.</p>
<p>He plays less of a day to day role</p>
<p>and is not running Google in the way he did.</p>
<p>But the interesting thing is he stepped back</p>
<p>in a quite tragic way from what I&rsquo;ve seen,</p>
<p>which is, I think Google&rsquo;s mission, initial mission</p>
<p>of making the world&rsquo;s information accessible to everybody</p>
<p>is one of the most beautiful missions of any company</p>
<p>in the history of the world.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s what Google has done with the search engine</p>
<p>and other efforts that are similar,</p>
<p>like scanning a lot of books, it&rsquo;s just incredible.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s similar to Wikipedia.</p>
<p>But what he said was that it&rsquo;s not the same company anymore.</p>
<p>And I know maybe I&rsquo;m reading too much into it</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s more maybe practically saying</p>
<p>just the size of the company is much larger,</p>
<p>the kind of leadership that&rsquo;s required.</p>
<p>But at the same time, they changed the model</p>
<p>from don&rsquo;t be evil to it&rsquo;s becoming corporatized</p>
<p>and all those kinds of things and it&rsquo;s sad.</p>
<p>There also are cycles, right?</p>
<p>History is about cycles, right?</p>
<p>There are cycles to life, there are cycles to organizations.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sad.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s sad Steve Jobs leaving Apple</p>
<p>by passing away, sad.</p>
<p>You know, what the future of SpaceX and Tesla looks like</p>
<p>without Elon Musk is quite sad.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very possible that those companies</p>
<p>become something very different.</p>
<p>They become something much more like corporate</p>
<p>and stale, yeah.</p>
<p>So maybe most of the progress is made through cycles.</p>
<p>Maybe a new Elon Musk comes along</p>
<p>and all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>But it does seem that the American system of government</p>
<p>has built into it the cycling that makes it effective</p>
<p>and it makes it last very long.</p>
<p>It lasts a very long time, right?</p>
<p>It continues to excel and lead the world.</p>
<p>Sure, sure.</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s hope it continues to.</p>
<p>No, I mean, we&rsquo;re into a third century</p>
<p>and democracies on this scale rarely last that long.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a point of pride, but it also means</p>
<p>we need to be attentive to keep our house in order</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not inevitable that this experiment continues.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s important to meditate on that actually.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve mentioned that FDR, Franklin D. Roosevelt</p>
<p>is one of the great leaders in American history.</p>
<p>Why is that?</p>
<p>Franklin Roosevelt had the power of empathy.</p>
<p>No leader that I&rsquo;ve ever studied or been around</p>
<p>or spent any time reading about was able to connect</p>
<p>with people who were so different from himself</p>
<p>as Franklin Roosevelt.</p>
<p>He came from the most elite family.</p>
<p>He never had to work for a paycheck in his life.</p>
<p>When he was president, he was still collecting</p>
<p>an allowance from his mom.</p>
<p>I mean, you couldn&rsquo;t be more elite than Franklin Roosevelt,</p>
<p>but he authentically connected.</p>
<p>This was not propaganda.</p>
<p>He was able to feel the pain and understand the lives</p>
<p>of some of the most destitute Americans</p>
<p>in other parts of the country.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>So through one of the hardest economic periods</p>
<p>of American history, he was able to feel the pain.</p>
<p>He was able to, the number of immigrants</p>
<p>I read oral histories from or who have written themselves,</p>
<p>Saul Bellow is one example, the great novelist</p>
<p>who talk about how as immigrants to the US,</p>
<p>Saul Bellow was a Russian Jewish immigrant.</p>
<p>He said, growing up in Chicago, politicians were all trying</p>
<p>to steal from us.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t think any of them cared until I heard FDR.</p>
<p>And I knew he spoke to me.</p>
<p>And I think part of it was FDR really tried</p>
<p>to understand people.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the first thing, he was humble enough</p>
<p>to try to do that.</p>
<p>But second, he had a talent for that.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s hard to know exactly what it was,</p>
<p>but he had a talent for putting himself,</p>
<p>imagining himself in someone else&rsquo;s shoes.</p>
<p>What stands out to you as important?</p>
<p>I mean, so he was, he went through the great depression.</p>
<p>The, so the new deal, which some people criticize,</p>
<p>some people see, I mean, it&rsquo;s funny to look at some</p>
<p>of these policies and their long ripple effects.</p>
<p>But at the time, it&rsquo;s some of the most innovative policies</p>
<p>in the history of America.</p>
<p>You could say they&rsquo;re ultimately not good for America,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re nevertheless hold within them very rich</p>
<p>and important lessons.</p>
<p>But the new deal, obviously World War II,</p>
<p>that entire process, is there something that stands out</p>
<p>to you as a particularly great moment that made FDR?</p>
<p>Yes, I think what FDR does from his first 100 days</p>
<p>in office forward, and this begins with his fireside chats,</p>
<p>is he helps Americans to see that they&rsquo;re all in it together.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s by creating hope and creating a sense</p>
<p>of common suffering and common mission.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not offering simple solutions.</p>
<p>One of the lessons from FDR is,</p>
<p>if you wanna bring people together,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t offer a simple solution.</p>
<p>Because as soon as I offer a simple solution,</p>
<p>I have people for it and against it.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>Explain the problem, frame the problem,</p>
<p>and then give people a mission.</p>
<p>So Roosevelt&rsquo;s first radio address in March of 1933,</p>
<p>the banking system is collapsing.</p>
<p>And we can&rsquo;t imagine it, right?</p>
<p>Banks were closing and you couldn&rsquo;t get your money out.</p>
<p>Your life savings would be lost, right?</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t imagine that happening in our world today.</p>
<p>He comes on the radio, he takes five minutes</p>
<p>to explain how banking works.</p>
<p>Most people didn&rsquo;t understand how banking worked, right?</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t actually hold your money in a vault.</p>
<p>They lend it out to someone else.</p>
<p>And then he explains why if you go and take your money</p>
<p>out of the bank and put it in your mattress,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re making it worse for yourself.</p>
<p>He explains this.</p>
<p>And then he says, I don&rsquo;t have a solution,</p>
<p>but here&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m gonna do.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna send in government officers to examine the banks</p>
<p>and show you the books on the banks.</p>
<p>And I want you to help me by going</p>
<p>and putting your money back in the bank.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re all gonna do this together.</p>
<p>No simple solution, no ideological statement,</p>
<p>but a sense of common mission.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go out and do this together.</p>
<p>When you read as I have so many of these oral histories</p>
<p>and memoirs for people who lived through that period,</p>
<p>many of them disagreed with some of his policies.</p>
<p>Many of them thought he was too close to Jews</p>
<p>and they didn&rsquo;t like the fact he had a woman</p>
<p>in his cabinet and all that, but they felt he cared.</p>
<p>And they felt they were part of some common mission.</p>
<p>And when they talk about their experience fighting</p>
<p>in World War II, whether in Europe or Asia,</p>
<p>it was that that prepared them.</p>
<p>They knew what it meant to be an American</p>
<p>when they were over there.</p>
<p>So that to me is a model of leadership.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s as possible today as it&rsquo;s ever been.</p>
<p>So you think it&rsquo;s possible, like I was going to ask this,</p>
<p>again, it may be a very shallow view,</p>
<p>but it feels like this country is more divided</p>
<p>than it has been in recent history.</p>
<p>Perhaps the social media and all those kinds of things</p>
<p>are merely revealing the division</p>
<p>as opposed to creating the division.</p>
<p>But is it possible to have a leader</p>
<p>that unites in the same way that FDR did without,</p>
<p>well, we&rsquo;re living through a pandemic.</p>
<p>This is already, so like, I was going to say</p>
<p>without suffering, but this is economic suffering.</p>
<p>A huge number of people have lost their job.</p>
<p>So is it possible to have, is there one a hunger?</p>
<p>Is there a possibility to have an FDR style leader</p>
<p>who unites?</p>
<p>Yes, I think that is what President Biden is trying.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying he&rsquo;ll succeed,</p>
<p>but I think that&rsquo;s what he&rsquo;s trying to do.</p>
<p>The way you do this is you do not allow yourself</p>
<p>to be captured by your opponents in Congress</p>
<p>or somewhere else.</p>
<p>FDR had a lot of opponents in Congress.</p>
<p>He had a lot of opponents in politics,</p>
<p>governors and others who didn&rsquo;t like him.</p>
<p>Herbert Hoover was still around</p>
<p>and still accusing FDR of being a conspiratist</p>
<p>and all these other things.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t allow yourself to be captured</p>
<p>by the leaders of the other side.</p>
<p>You go over their heads to the people.</p>
<p>And so today, the way to do this is to explain to people</p>
<p>and empathize with the suffering and dislocation</p>
<p>and difficulties they&rsquo;re dealing with</p>
<p>and show that you&rsquo;re trying to help them.</p>
<p>Not an easy solution, not a simple statement,</p>
<p>but here are some things we can all do together.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I think infrastructure makes a lot of sense.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s what FDR invested into, right?</p>
<p>FDR built Hoover Dam.</p>
<p>Hoover Dam turned the lights on for young Lyndon Johnson</p>
<p>who grew up outside of Austin, right?</p>
<p>FDR was the one who invested in road construction</p>
<p>that was then continued by Dwight Eisenhower,</p>
<p>by a Republican with the interstate highway system, right?</p>
<p>FDR invested through the WPA in building thousands</p>
<p>of schools in our country, planting trees.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the kind of work that can bring people together.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to be a Democrat or a Republican to say,</p>
<p>you know what, we&rsquo;d be a lot better off in my community</p>
<p>if we had better infrastructure today.</p>
<p>I wanna be a part of that.</p>
<p>Oh, well, maybe I can get a job doing that.</p>
<p>Maybe my company can benefit from that.</p>
<p>You bring people together and that way</p>
<p>it becomes a common mission,</p>
<p>even if we have different ideological positions.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s funny.</p>
<p>When I first heard Joe Biden,</p>
<p>many years ago, I think he ran for president against Obama.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s correct.</p>
<p>Before I heard him speak, I really liked him.</p>
<p>But once I heard him speak,</p>
<p>I started liking him less and less.</p>
<p>And it speaks to something interesting,</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s hard to put into words</p>
<p>why you connect with people.</p>
<p>The empathy that you mentioned in FDR,</p>
<p>you have these bad, pardon the French, motherfuckers</p>
<p>like Teddy Roosevelt that connect with you.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something just powerful.</p>
<p>And with Joe Biden, I wanna really like him.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s something not quite there</p>
<p>where it feels like he doesn&rsquo;t quite know my pain,</p>
<p>even though he, on paper, is exactly,</p>
<p>he knows the pain of the people</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s something not connecting.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s hard to explain.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to put into words.</p>
<p>And it makes me not,</p>
<p>as an engineer and scientist,</p>
<p>it makes me not feel good about presidencies</p>
<p>because it makes me feel like it&rsquo;s more art than science.</p>
<p>It is an art.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s exactly an art</p>
<p>for the reasons you laid out, it&rsquo;s aesthetic.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about feeling, it&rsquo;s about emotion,</p>
<p>all the things that we can&rsquo;t engineer.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve tried for centuries to engineer emotion.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re never gonna do it.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t try it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a parent of teenagers.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t even try to explain emotion.</p>
<p>But you hit on the key point</p>
<p>and the key challenge for Biden.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s gotta find the right words.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not finding the words to bullshit people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s finding the words to help express.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve all felt empowered and felt good.</p>
<p>When someone uses words</p>
<p>that put into words what we&rsquo;re feeling,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what he needs.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the job of a leader.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s certain words,</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t heard many politicians use those words,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s certain words that make you forget</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re for immigration or against immigration.</p>
<p>Make you forget whether you&rsquo;re for wars and against wars.</p>
<p>Make you forget about the bickering</p>
<p>and somehow inspire you, elevate you</p>
<p>to believe in the greatness that this country could be.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>In that same way, the reason I moved to Austin,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s funny to say, I just heard words</p>
<p>from people, from friends,</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re excited by the possibility of the future here.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t thinking like, what&rsquo;s the right thing to do?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the strategic,</p>
<p>cause I wanna launch a business.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of arguments for San Francisco</p>
<p>or maybe staying in Boston in my case,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s this excitement that was beyond reason.</p>
<p>That was emotional.</p>
<p>Yes, yes.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what it seems like.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what builds, that&rsquo;s what great leaders do,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s what builds countries.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what builds great businesses.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s what people say about Austin,</p>
<p>for example, all the time.</p>
<p>A talented people who come here like yourself.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s the interesting thing.</p>
<p>No one person creates that.</p>
<p>The words emerge.</p>
<p>And part of what FDR understood,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got to find the words out there and use them.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to be the creator of them.</p>
<p>Just as the great painter doesn&rsquo;t invent the painting,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re taking things from others.</p>
<p>As a small aside,</p>
<p>is there something you could say about FDR</p>
<p>and Hitler?</p>
<p>I constantly tried to think,</p>
<p>can this person, can this moment in history</p>
<p>have been circumvented, prevented?</p>
<p>Can Hitler have been stopped?</p>
<p>Can some of the atrocities from my own family</p>
<p>that my grandparents had to live through</p>
<p>the starvation in the Soviet Union,</p>
<p>so the thing that people don&rsquo;t often talk about</p>
<p>is the atrocities committed by Stalin and his own people.</p>
<p>It feels like here&rsquo;s this great leader, FDR,</p>
<p>that had the chance to have an impact on the world</p>
<p>that he already probably had a great positive impact,</p>
<p>but had a chance to stop maybe World War II</p>
<p>or stop some of the evils.</p>
<p>When you look at how weak Hitler was</p>
<p>from much of the 30s relative to militarily,</p>
<p>relative to everything else,</p>
<p>how many people could have done a lot to stop him?</p>
<p>And FDR in particular didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>He tried to play, not pacify,</p>
<p>but basically do diplomacy and let Germany do Germany,</p>
<p>let Europe do Europe, and focus on America.</p>
<p>Is there something you would,</p>
<p>would you hold his feet to the fire on this?</p>
<p>Or is it very difficult from the perspective of FDR</p>
<p>to have known what was coming?</p>
<p>I think FDR had a sense of what was coming,</p>
<p>not quite the enormity of what Hitler was doing</p>
<p>and not quite the enormity of what the Holocaust became.</p>
<p>I also lost relatives in the Holocaust.</p>
<p>And part of that was beyond the imagination of human beings.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s clear in his papers that as early as 1934,</p>
<p>people he respected, who he knew well,</p>
<p>told him that Hitler was very dangerous.</p>
<p>They also thought Hitler was crazy, that he was a lunatic.</p>
<p>Hamilton Fish Armstrong, who was a friend of Roosevelt&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>who was actually the Council on Foreign Relations</p>
<p>in New York, had a meeting with Hitler in 1934.</p>
<p>I remember reading the account of this.</p>
<p>And he basically said to FDR,</p>
<p>this man is gonna cause a war.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s gonna cause a lot of damage.</p>
<p>Again, they didn&rsquo;t know quite the scale.</p>
<p>So they saw this coming.</p>
<p>They saw this coming.</p>
<p>FDR had two problems.</p>
<p>First, he had an American public that was deeply isolationist.</p>
<p>The opposite of the problem in a sense</p>
<p>that we were talking about before.</p>
<p>If we&rsquo;re an over militarized society,</p>
<p>now we were a deeply isolationist society in the 1930s.</p>
<p>The depression reinforced that.</p>
<p>FDR actually had to break the law in the late 30s</p>
<p>to support the allies.</p>
<p>So it was very hard to move the country in that direction,</p>
<p>especially when he had this program at home,</p>
<p>the New Deal, that he didn&rsquo;t wanna jeopardize</p>
<p>by alienating an isolationist public.</p>
<p>That was the reality.</p>
<p>We talked about political manipulation.</p>
<p>He had to be conscious of that.</p>
<p>He had to know his audience.</p>
<p>And second, there were no allies willing</p>
<p>to invest in this either.</p>
<p>The British were as committed to appeasement, as you know.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re obviously very knowledgeable about this.</p>
<p>The French were as well.</p>
<p>It was very hard.</p>
<p>The Russian government, the Soviet government</p>
<p>was cooperating to remilitarize Germany.</p>
<p>So there weren&rsquo;t a lot of allies out there either.</p>
<p>I think if there&rsquo;s a criticism to be made of FDR,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s that once we&rsquo;re in the war,</p>
<p>he didn&rsquo;t do enough to stop,</p>
<p>in particular, the killing of Jews.</p>
<p>And there are a number of historians,</p>
<p>myself included, who have written about this,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s an endless debate.</p>
<p>What should he have done?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no doubt by 1944,</p>
<p>the United States had air superiority</p>
<p>and could have bombed the rail lines to Auschwitz</p>
<p>and other camps,</p>
<p>and that would have saved as many as a million Jews.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a lot of people who could have been saved.</p>
<p>Why didn&rsquo;t FDR insist on that?</p>
<p>In part, because he wanted to use every resource possible</p>
<p>to win the war.</p>
<p>He did not want to be accused of fighting the war for Jews.</p>
<p>But I think it&rsquo;s also fair to say</p>
<p>that he probably cared less about Jews and East Europeans</p>
<p>than he did about others,</p>
<p>those of his own Dutch ancestry and from Western Europe.</p>
<p>And so, even their race comes in,</p>
<p>is also the explanation for the internment of Japanese</p>
<p>in the United States,</p>
<p>which is a horrible war crime</p>
<p>committed by this heroic president.</p>
<p>120,000 Japanese American citizens</p>
<p>lost their freedom unnecessarily.</p>
<p>So, he had his limitations.</p>
<p>And I think he could have done more during the war</p>
<p>to save many more lives.</p>
<p>And I wish he had.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s something to be said about empathy</p>
<p>that you spoke that FDR had empathy.</p>
<p>But us, for example,</p>
<p>now there&rsquo;s many people who describe the atrocities</p>
<p>happening in China.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a bunch of places across the world</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s atrocities happening now.</p>
<p>And we care.</p>
<p>We do not uniformly apply how much we care</p>
<p>for the suffering of others.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s correct.</p>
<p>Depending on the group.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s correct.</p>
<p>And in some sense, the role of the president</p>
<p>is to rise above that natural human inclination</p>
<p>to protect, to do the us versus them,</p>
<p>to protect the inner circle</p>
<p>and empathize with the suffering of those</p>
<p>that are not like you.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s correct.</p>
<p>I agree with that.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Speaking of war, you wrote a book on Henry Kissinger.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a great transition,</p>
<p>but it made sense in my head.</p>
<p>Who was Henry Kissinger as a man</p>
<p>and as a historical figure?</p>
<p>So Henry Kissinger to me is one of the most fascinating</p>
<p>figures in history,</p>
<p>because he comes to the United States</p>
<p>as a German Jewish immigrant at age 15,</p>
<p>speaking no English.</p>
<p>And within a few years, he&rsquo;s a major figure</p>
<p>influencing US foreign policy at the height of US power.</p>
<p>But while he&rsquo;s doing that,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s never elected to office</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s constantly reviled by people,</p>
<p>including people who are anti Semitic because he&rsquo;s Jewish,</p>
<p>but at the same time also his exoticism</p>
<p>makes him more attractive to people.</p>
<p>So someone like Nelson Rockefeller wants Kissinger around.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s one of Kissinger&rsquo;s first patrons</p>
<p>because he wants a really smart Jew.</p>
<p>And Kissinger is gonna be that smart Jew</p>
<p>I call Kissinger a policy Jew.</p>
<p>There were these court Jews in the 16th and 17th</p>
<p>and 18th centuries in Europe.</p>
<p>Every king wanted the Jew to manage his banking.</p>
<p>And in a sense in the United States</p>
<p>in the second half of the 20th century,</p>
<p>many presidents want a Jew</p>
<p>to manage their international affairs.</p>
<p>And what does that really mean?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just about being Jewish,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the internationalism, it&rsquo;s the cosmopolitanism.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s one of the things</p>
<p>I was fascinated with with Kissinger.</p>
<p>Someone like Kissinger is unthinkable</p>
<p>as a powerful figure in the United States</p>
<p>30 or 40 years earlier,</p>
<p>because the United States is run by WASD.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s run by white elites</p>
<p>who come from a certain background.</p>
<p>Kissinger represents a moment when American society</p>
<p>opens up not to everyone,</p>
<p>but opens up to these cosmopolitan figures</p>
<p>who have language skills, historical knowledge,</p>
<p>networks that can be used for the US government</p>
<p>when after World War II, we have to rebuild Europe,</p>
<p>when we have to negotiate with the Soviet Union,</p>
<p>when we need the kinds of knowledge we didn&rsquo;t have before.</p>
<p>And Harvard where he gets his education late,</p>
<p>he started at City College actually,</p>
<p>but Harvard where he gets his education late</p>
<p>is at the center of what&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>at all these major universities,</p>
<p>at Harvard, at Yale, at Stanford,</p>
<p>at the University of Texas, everywhere,</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re growing in their international affairs,</p>
<p>bringing in the kinds of people</p>
<p>who never would be at the university before,</p>
<p>training them and then enlisting them in Cold War activities.</p>
<p>And so Kissinger is a representative of that phenomenon.</p>
<p>I became interested in him</p>
<p>because I think he&rsquo;s a bellwether.</p>
<p>He shows how power has changed in the United States.</p>
<p>So he enters this whole world of politics,</p>
<p>what, post World War II in the 50s?</p>
<p>Yes, so he actually, in the 40s even,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an extraordinary story.</p>
<p>He comes to the United States in 1938,</p>
<p>just before Kristallnacht, his family leaves.</p>
<p>He actually grew up right outside of Nuremberg.</p>
<p>They leave right before Kristallnacht in fall of 38,</p>
<p>come to New York.</p>
<p>He originally works in a brush factory, cleaning brushes,</p>
<p>goes to a public high school.</p>
<p>And in 1942, just after Pearl Harbor, he joins the military.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s very quickly in the military,</p>
<p>first of all, given citizenship, which he didn&rsquo;t have before.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s sent for the first time outside of a kosher home.</p>
<p>He had been in a kosher home his entire life.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s sent to South Carolina to eat ham for Uncle Sam.</p>
<p>And then he is, and this is extraordinary,</p>
<p>at the age of 20, barely speaking English,</p>
<p>he is sent back to Germany with the US Army</p>
<p>in an elite counterintelligence role, why?</p>
<p>Because they need German speakers.</p>
<p>He came when he was 15,</p>
<p>so he actually understands the society.</p>
<p>They need people who have that cultural knowledge.</p>
<p>And because he&rsquo;s Jewish,</p>
<p>they can trust that he&rsquo;ll be anti Nazi.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a whole group of these figures.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s one of many.</p>
<p>And so he&rsquo;s in an elite circle.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s discriminated against in New York.</p>
<p>When he goes to Harvard after that,</p>
<p>he can only live in a Jewish only dorm.</p>
<p>But at the same time,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s in an elite policy role in counterintelligence.</p>
<p>He forms a network there that stays with him</p>
<p>the rest of his career.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a gentleman named Fritz Kramer,</p>
<p>who becomes a sponsor of his</p>
<p>in the emerging Pentagon Defense Department world.</p>
<p>And as early as the early 1950s,</p>
<p>he sent them to Korea to comment on affairs in Korea.</p>
<p>He becomes both an intellectual recognized</p>
<p>for his connections,</p>
<p>but also someone who policymakers wanna talk about.</p>
<p>His book on nuclear weapons, when it&rsquo;s written,</p>
<p>is given to President Eisenhower to read</p>
<p>because they say this is someone writing interesting things.</p>
<p>You should read what he says.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a certain aspect to him</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s kind of like Forrest Gump.</p>
<p>He seems to continuously be the right person</p>
<p>at the right time in the right place.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Somehow finding him in this.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna, you know,</p>
<p>you can only get lucky so many times</p>
<p>because he continues to get lucky</p>
<p>in terms of being at the right place in history</p>
<p>for many decades, until today.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, he has a knack for that.</p>
<p>I spent a lot of time talking with him.</p>
<p>And what comes through very quickly</p>
<p>is that he has an eye for power.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, I think, unhealthy.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s obsessed with power.</p>
<p>Can you explain like an observer of power</p>
<p>or does he want power himself?</p>
<p>Yes, both of those things.</p>
<p>Both of those.</p>
<p>And I think I explained this in the book.</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t agree with what I&rsquo;m gonna say now,</p>
<p>but I think I&rsquo;m right and I think he&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very hard to analyze yourself, right?</p>
<p>I think he develops an obsession with gaining power</p>
<p>because he sees what happens when you have no power.</p>
<p>He experiences the trauma.</p>
<p>His father is a very respected Gymnasium Lehrer in Germany.</p>
<p>Even though he&rsquo;s Jewish,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s actually the teacher of German classics</p>
<p>to the German kids.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s forced to flee and he becomes nothing.</p>
<p>His father never really makes a way</p>
<p>for himself in the United States.</p>
<p>He becomes a postal delivery person,</p>
<p>which is nothing wrong with that,</p>
<p>but for someone who&rsquo;s a respected teacher in Germany,</p>
<p>and Gymnasium Lehrer are like professors there, right?</p>
<p>To then be in this position.</p>
<p>His mother has to open a catering business</p>
<p>when they come to New York.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a typical immigrant story, but he sees the trauma.</p>
<p>His grandparents are killed by the Nazis.</p>
<p>So he sees the trauma and he realizes how perilous it is</p>
<p>to be without power.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re saying he does not want to acknowledge</p>
<p>the effect of that?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard.</p>
<p>I mean, most of us, if we&rsquo;ve had trauma,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s believable that it&rsquo;s traumatic</p>
<p>because you don&rsquo;t talk about it.</p>
<p>I have a friend who interviews combat veterans and he says,</p>
<p>as soon as someone freely wants to tell me</p>
<p>about their combat trauma,</p>
<p>I suspect that they&rsquo;re not telling me the truth.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s traumatic, it&rsquo;s hard to talk about.</p>
<p>Yeah, sometimes I wonder how much from my own life,</p>
<p>everything that I&rsquo;ve ever done is just the result</p>
<p>of the complicated relationship with my father.</p>
<p>I tend to, I had a really difficult time.</p>
<p>I did a podcast conversation with him.</p>
<p>I saw it actually.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>It was, I was thinking I could never do that with my father.</p>
<p>But I remember as I was doing it,</p>
<p>and for months after I regretted doing it,</p>
<p>I just kept regretting it.</p>
<p>And the fact that I was regretting it spoke to the fact</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m running away from some truths</p>
<p>that are back there somewhere.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s perhaps what Kissinger is as well.</p>
<p>But is there, I mean, he&rsquo;s done,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s been a part of so many interesting moments</p>
<p>of American history, of world history,</p>
<p>from the Cold War, Vietnam War, until today.</p>
<p>What stands out to you as a particularly important moment</p>
<p>in his career that made who he is?</p>
<p>Well, I think what made his career in many ways</p>
<p>was his experience in the 1950s, building a network,</p>
<p>a network of people across the world</p>
<p>who were rising leaders from unique positions.</p>
<p>He ran what he called the International Seminar at Harvard,</p>
<p>which was actually a summer school class</p>
<p>that no one at Harvard cared about.</p>
<p>But he invited all of these rising intellectuals</p>
<p>and thinkers from around the world.</p>
<p>And he built a network there that he used forevermore.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what really, I think, boosts him.</p>
<p>The most important moments in terms of making his reputation</p>
<p>and making his career are two sets of activities.</p>
<p>One is the opening to China.</p>
<p>And his ability to, first of all,</p>
<p>take control of US policy without the authority to do that</p>
<p>and direct US policy, and then build a relationship</p>
<p>with Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai that was unthinkable</p>
<p>just four or five years earlier.</p>
<p>Of course, President Nixon is a big part of that as well,</p>
<p>but Kissinger is the mover and shaker on that.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a lot of manipulation, but it&rsquo;s also a vision.</p>
<p>Now, this is in the moment of American history</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s a very powerful anti communism.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>So communism is seen as much more even though</p>
<p>than today as the enemy.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>And China in particular,</p>
<p>they were one of our key enemies in Vietnam.</p>
<p>And in Korea, American forces</p>
<p>were fighting Chinese forces directly.</p>
<p>Chinese forces come over the border.</p>
<p>Thousands of Americans die at the hand of Chinese forces.</p>
<p>So for the long time, the United States</p>
<p>had no relationship with communist China.</p>
<p>He opens that relationship.</p>
<p>And at the same time, he also creates a whole new dynamic</p>
<p>in the Middle East.</p>
<p>After the 1973 war, the so called Yom Kippur War,</p>
<p>he steps in and becomes the leading negotiator</p>
<p>between the Israelis, the Egyptians,</p>
<p>and other major actors in the region.</p>
<p>And it makes the United States the most powerful actor</p>
<p>in the Middle East, the Soviet Union far less powerful,</p>
<p>which is great for the United States in the 70s and 80s.</p>
<p>It gets us though into the problems</p>
<p>we of course have thereafter.</p>
<p>So that speaks to the very pragmatic approach</p>
<p>that he&rsquo;s taken the realistic approach</p>
<p>versus the idealistic approach termed realpolitik.</p>
<p>What is this thing?</p>
<p>What is this approach to world politics?</p>
<p>So realpolitik for Kissinger is really focusing</p>
<p>on the power centers in the world</p>
<p>and trying as best you can to manipulate</p>
<p>those power centers to serve the interests</p>
<p>of your own country.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s why he&rsquo;s a multilateralist.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not a unilateralist.</p>
<p>He believes the United States should put itself</p>
<p>at the center of negotiations</p>
<p>between other powerful countries.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s also why he pays very little attention</p>
<p>to countries that are less powerful.</p>
<p>And this is why he&rsquo;s often criticized</p>
<p>by human rights activists.</p>
<p>For him, parts of Africa and Latin America,</p>
<p>which you and I would consider important places</p>
<p>are unimportant because they don&rsquo;t have power.</p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t project their power.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t produce a lot of economic wealth.</p>
<p>And so they matter less.</p>
<p>Realpolitik views the world in a hierarchy of power.</p>
<p>How does realpolitik realize itself in the world?</p>
<p>What does that really mean?</p>
<p>Like how do you push forward the interest</p>
<p>of your own country?</p>
<p>You said there&rsquo;s power centers,</p>
<p>but it is a big bold move to negotiate</p>
<p>to work with a communist nation,</p>
<p>with your enemies that are powerful.</p>
<p>What is the sort of, if you can further elaborate</p>
<p>the philosophy behind it.</p>
<p>Sure, so there are two key elements</p>
<p>that then end up producing all kinds of tactics.</p>
<p>But the two strategic elements of Kissinger&rsquo;s way</p>
<p>of thinking about realpolitik,</p>
<p>which are classical ways,</p>
<p>going back to Thucydides and the Greeks,</p>
<p>are to say, first of all,</p>
<p>you figure out who your allies are</p>
<p>and you build webs of connection</p>
<p>so that your allies help you to acquire</p>
<p>what you want to acquire.</p>
<p>This is why, according to Herodotus,</p>
<p>the Greeks beat the Persians.</p>
<p>The Persians are bigger,</p>
<p>but the Greeks, the Spartans, the Athenians,</p>
<p>others are able to work together</p>
<p>and leverage their resources.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s about leveraging your resources.</p>
<p>For Kissinger, this makes Western Europe</p>
<p>crucially important.</p>
<p>It makes Japan crucially important.</p>
<p>It makes Israel and Egypt crucially important</p>
<p>in building these webs.</p>
<p>You build your surrogates,</p>
<p>you build your brother states.</p>
<p>In other parts of the world,</p>
<p>you build tight connections and you work together</p>
<p>to control the resources that you want.</p>
<p>The second element of the strategy</p>
<p>is not to go to war with your adversary,</p>
<p>but to do all you can to limit the power</p>
<p>of your adversary.</p>
<p>Some of that is containment,</p>
<p>preventing the Soviet Union from expanding.</p>
<p>That was the key element of American Cold War policy.</p>
<p>But sometimes it&rsquo;s actually negotiation.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what detente was about for Kissinger.</p>
<p>He spends a lot of time,</p>
<p>more time than any other American foreign policymaker,</p>
<p>negotiating with Soviet leaders</p>
<p>as well as Chinese leaders.</p>
<p>What does he want to do?</p>
<p>He wants to limit the nuclear arms race.</p>
<p>The United States is ahead.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t want the Soviet Union to get ahead of us.</p>
<p>We negotiate to limit their abilities, right?</p>
<p>We play to our strengths.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a combination of keeping your adversary down</p>
<p>and building tight webs.</p>
<p>Within that context, military force is used,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re not using war for the sake of war.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re using warfare to further your access to the resources,</p>
<p>economic, political, geographic that you want.</p>
<p>To build relationships and then the second thing,</p>
<p>to limit the powers of those you&rsquo;re against.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>So is there any sort of insights</p>
<p>into how he preferred to build relationships?</p>
<p>Are we talking about like, again, it&rsquo;s the one on one.</p>
<p>Is it through policy or is it through like,</p>
<p>phone conversations?</p>
<p>Is there any cool kind of insights that you could speak to?</p>
<p>Yeah, Kissinger is the ultimate kiss up.</p>
<p>He is, some used to make fun of him.</p>
<p>In fact, even the filmmaker from Dr. Strangelove,</p>
<p>whose name I&rsquo;m forgetting, Stanley Kubrick,</p>
<p>called him kiss up at that time, right?</p>
<p>He had a wonderful way of figuring out</p>
<p>what it is you wanted, back to that discussion we had before</p>
<p>and trying to show how he could give you more</p>
<p>of what you wanted as a leader.</p>
<p>It was very personalistic, very personalistic.</p>
<p>And he spends a lot of time, for example,</p>
<p>kissing up to Leonid Brezhnev, kissing up to Mao.</p>
<p>He tells Mao, you&rsquo;re the greatest leader</p>
<p>in the history of the 20th century.</p>
<p>People will look back on you as the great leader.</p>
<p>Some of this sounds like BS, but it&rsquo;s serious, right?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s feeding the egos of those around him.</p>
<p>Second, he is willing to get things done for you.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s effective.</p>
<p>You want him around you because of his efficacy.</p>
<p>So Richard Nixon is always suspicious</p>
<p>that Henry Kissinger is getting more of the limelight.</p>
<p>He hates that Kissinger gets the Nobel Peace Prize</p>
<p>and he doesn&rsquo;t, but he needs him.</p>
<p>Because Kissinger&rsquo;s the guy who gets things done.</p>
<p>So he performs.</p>
<p>He builds a relationship in almost,</p>
<p>I say this in the book, in almost a gangster way.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t like that he criticized that part of the book.</p>
<p>But again, I still think the evidence is there.</p>
<p>You need something to be done, boss, I&rsquo;ll do it.</p>
<p>And don&rsquo;t forget that I&rsquo;m doing this for you.</p>
<p>And you get mutual dependency in a Hegelian way, right?</p>
<p>And so he builds this personal dependency</p>
<p>through ego and through performance.</p>
<p>And then he&rsquo;s so skillful at making decisions</p>
<p>for people who are more powerful</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s never elected to office.</p>
<p>He always needs powerful people to let him do things.</p>
<p>But he convinces you it&rsquo;s your decision when it&rsquo;s really his.</p>
<p>To read his memos are beautiful.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s actually very skilled at writing things</p>
<p>in a way that looks like he&rsquo;s giving you options</p>
<p>as president, but in fact, there&rsquo;s only one option there.</p>
<p>Is he, speaking to the gangster, to the loyalty,</p>
<p>is he ever, like the sense I got from Nixon</p>
<p>is he would, Nixon would backstab you if he needed to.</p>
<p>One of the things that I admire about gangsters</p>
<p>is they don&rsquo;t backstab those in their circle,</p>
<p>like loyalty above all else.</p>
<p>I mean, at least that&rsquo;s the sense I&rsquo;ve gotten</p>
<p>from the stories of the past, at least.</p>
<p>Is, where would you put Kissinger on that?</p>
<p>Is he loyalty above all else?</p>
<p>Or is it, or a human, it&rsquo;s like the Steve Jobs thing,</p>
<p>is like, as long as you&rsquo;re useful, you&rsquo;re useful,</p>
<p>but then once, the moment you&rsquo;re no longer useful</p>
<p>is when you&rsquo;re knocked off the chessboard.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the latter with him.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s backstabbing quite a lot.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s self serving.</p>
<p>But he also makes himself so useful</p>
<p>that even though Nixon knows he&rsquo;s doing that,</p>
<p>Nixon still needs him.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>By the way, on that point, so having spoken with Kissinger,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s your relationship like with him</p>
<p>as somebody who is in an objective way writing his story?</p>
<p>It was very difficult</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s very good at manipulating people.</p>
<p>And we had about 12 or 13 interviews,</p>
<p>usually informal over lunch.</p>
<p>And this was many years ago.</p>
<p>This is probably now more than 10 years ago.</p>
<p>Did you find yourself being like sweet talked,</p>
<p>like to where you like go back home later</p>
<p>and look in the mirror and it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>wait, what just happened?</p>
<p>He can be enormously charming</p>
<p>and enormously obnoxious at the same time.</p>
<p>So I would have these very mixed emotions</p>
<p>because he gives no ground.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s unwilling to, and I think this is a weakness,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s unwilling to admit mistake.</p>
<p>Others make mistakes, but he doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And he certainly won&rsquo;t take on any of the big criticisms</p>
<p>that are pushed.</p>
<p>I understand why.</p>
<p>I mean, when you&rsquo;ve worked as hard for what he has</p>
<p>as he has, you&rsquo;re defensive about it.</p>
<p>But he is very defensive and he&rsquo;s very fragile about it.</p>
<p>He does not like criticisms at all.</p>
<p>He used to, he hasn&rsquo;t done this in a while,</p>
<p>but he used to call me up and yell at me on the phone,</p>
<p>quite literally, when I would be quoted</p>
<p>in the New York Times or somewhere saying something</p>
<p>that sounded critical of him.</p>
<p>So for instance, there was one instance</p>
<p>a number of years ago,</p>
<p>where a reporter came across some documents</p>
<p>where Kissinger said negative things about Jews in Russia.</p>
<p>Typical things that a German Jew would say</p>
<p>about East European Jews.</p>
<p>And the New York Times asked me, is this accurate?</p>
<p>And I said, yeah, the documents are accurate.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen them, they&rsquo;re accurate.</p>
<p>He was so angry about that.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s the fragility,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s also the enormous charm</p>
<p>and the enormous intelligence.</p>
<p>The real challenge with him though,</p>
<p>is he&rsquo;s very good at making his case.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;ll convince you.</p>
<p>And as a scholar, as an observer,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t wanna hear a lawyer&rsquo;s case.</p>
<p>You wanna actually interrogate the evidence</p>
<p>and get to the truth.</p>
<p>And so that was a real challenge with him.</p>
<p>So speaking of his approach of realpolitik,</p>
<p>if we just zoom out and look at a human history,</p>
<p>human civilization, what do you think works best</p>
<p>in the way we progress forward?</p>
<p>A realistic approach, do whatever it takes,</p>
<p>control the centers of power,</p>
<p>to play a game for the greater interests</p>
<p>of the good guys, quote unquote.</p>
<p>Or lead by sort of idealism,</p>
<p>which is like truly act in the best version</p>
<p>of the ideas you represent,</p>
<p>as opposed to kind of present one view</p>
<p>and then do whatever it takes behind the scenes.</p>
<p>Obviously you need some of both,</p>
<p>but I lean more to the idealistic side</p>
<p>and more so actually, believe it or not,</p>
<p>as I get into my 40s, as I do more historical work.</p>
<p>Why do I say that?</p>
<p>Because I think, and this is one of my criticisms</p>
<p>of Kissinger, who I also have a lot of respect for,</p>
<p>the realpolitik becomes self defeating</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re constantly running to keep power,</p>
<p>but you forget why.</p>
<p>And you often then use power,</p>
<p>and I think Kissinger falls into this</p>
<p>in some of his worst moments, not all of his moments,</p>
<p>where the power is actually being used</p>
<p>to undermine the things you care about.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sort of the example of being a parent</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re doing all these things</p>
<p>to take your kid to violin, basketball, all these things,</p>
<p>and you realize you&rsquo;re actually killing your kid</p>
<p>and making your kid very unhappy.</p>
<p>And the whole reason you were doing it</p>
<p>was to improve the person&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>And so you have to remember why it is,</p>
<p>what Hans Morgenthau calls this is your purpose.</p>
<p>Your purpose has to drive you.</p>
<p>Now your purpose doesn&rsquo;t have to be airy, fiery idealism.</p>
<p>So I believe deeply in democracy is an ideal.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s gonna ever look like Athenian democracy,</p>
<p>but that should drive our policy.</p>
<p>But we still have to be realistic</p>
<p>and recognize we&rsquo;re not gonna build that democracy</p>
<p>in Afghanistan tomorrow.</p>
<p>I mean, does it ultimately just boil down again</p>
<p>to the corrupting nature of power</p>
<p>that nobody can hold power for very long</p>
<p>before you start acting in the interest of power</p>
<p>as opposed to in the interest of your ideals?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s impossible to be like somebody like Kissinger</p>
<p>who is essentially in power for many, many decades</p>
<p>and still remember what are the initial ideals</p>
<p>that you strove to achieve.</p>
<p>Yes, I think that&rsquo;s exactly right.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a moment in the book I quote about him,</p>
<p>comes from one of our interviews.</p>
<p>I asked him, what were the guiding ideals for your policies?</p>
<p>And he said, I&rsquo;m not prepared to share that.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s because he doesn&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>what he thinks he was trying to do.</p>
<p>He realizes his use of power departed quite a lot from.</p>
<p>So it would sound, if he made them explicit,</p>
<p>it would sound hypocritical.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>Well, on that, let me ask about war.</p>
<p>America often presents itself to its own people,</p>
<p>but just the leaders, when they look in the mirror,</p>
<p>I get a sense that we think of ourselves as the good guys.</p>
<p>And especially this begins sometimes to look hypocritical</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re waging war.</p>
<p>Is there a good way to know when you&rsquo;ve lost all sense</p>
<p>of what it is to be good?</p>
<p>Another way to ask that, is there in military policy</p>
<p>in conducting war, is there a good way to know</p>
<p>what is a just war and what is a war crime?</p>
<p>I mean, in some circles, Kissinger is accused</p>
<p>of contributing, being a war criminal.</p>
<p>Yes, and I argue in the book, he&rsquo;s not a war criminal,</p>
<p>but that doesn&rsquo;t mean that he didn&rsquo;t misuse military power.</p>
<p>I think a just war, a just war,</p>
<p>as Michael Walzer and others write about it,</p>
<p>a just war is a war where both the purpose is just,</p>
<p>and you are using the means to get to that purpose</p>
<p>that kill as few people as necessary.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t mean they won&rsquo;t be killing,</p>
<p>but as few as necessary.</p>
<p>Proportionality, right?</p>
<p>Your means should be proportional to your ends.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s often lost sight of,</p>
<p>because the drive to get to the end often self justifies</p>
<p>means that go well beyond that.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s how we get into torture in the war on terror.</p>
<p>Is there some kind of lesson for the future</p>
<p>that you can take away from that?</p>
<p>Yes, I think the first set of lessons that I&rsquo;ve shared</p>
<p>as a historian with military decision makers is,</p>
<p>first of all, always remember why you&rsquo;re there,</p>
<p>what your purpose is, and always ask yourself</p>
<p>if the means you&rsquo;re using are actually proportional.</p>
<p>Ask that question.</p>
<p>Just because you have these means that you can use,</p>
<p>just because you have these tools,</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t mean they&rsquo;re the right tools to use.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s the question that follows from that.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a hard question to ask,</p>
<p>because the answer is one we often don&rsquo;t like to hear.</p>
<p>Are the things I&rsquo;m doing in war actually doing more harm</p>
<p>or more good to the reason I went into war?</p>
<p>We came to a point in the war on terror</p>
<p>where what we were doing was actually</p>
<p>creating more terrorists.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s when you have to stop.</p>
<p>Well, some of that is in the data,</p>
<p>but some of it, there&rsquo;s a leap of faith.</p>
<p>So from a parenting perspective,</p>
<p>let me speak as a person with no kids and a single guy,</p>
<p>let me be the expert in the room on parenting.</p>
<p>Now, it does seem that it&rsquo;s a very difficult thing to do,</p>
<p>even though you know that your kid was making a mistake,</p>
<p>to let them make a mistake,</p>
<p>to give them the freedom to make the mistake.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what to do,</p>
<p>but I mean, that&rsquo;s a very kind of lighthearted way</p>
<p>of phrasing the following,</p>
<p>which is when you look at some of the places in the world,</p>
<p>like Afghanistan, which is not doing well.</p>
<p>To move out knowing that there&rsquo;s going to be</p>
<p>a lot of suffering, economic suffering, injustices,</p>
<p>terrorist organizations growing,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s committing crimes on its own people</p>
<p>and potentially committing crimes against allies,</p>
<p>violence against allies, violence against the United States.</p>
<p>So how do you know what to do in that case?</p>
<p>Well, again, it&rsquo;s an art, not a science,</p>
<p>which is what makes it hard for an engineer to think about.</p>
<p>This is what makes it endlessly fascinating for me.</p>
<p>And I think the real intellectual work</p>
<p>is at the level of the art, right?</p>
<p>And I think probably engineering at its highest level</p>
<p>becomes an art as well, right?</p>
<p>So policymaking, you never know.</p>
<p>But I will say this,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll say you have to ask yourself and look in the mirror</p>
<p>and say, is all the effort I&rsquo;m putting in</p>
<p>actually making this better?</p>
<p>And in Afghanistan, you look at the 20 years</p>
<p>and two plus trillion dollars that the US has put in.</p>
<p>And the fact that, as you said correctly,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not doing well right now</p>
<p>after 20 years of that investment.</p>
<p>I might like a company that I invest in,</p>
<p>but after 20 years of my throwing money in that company,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s time to get out.</p>
<p>Well, in some sense, getting out now, that&rsquo;s kind of obvious.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m more interested in how we figure out in the future</p>
<p>how to get out earlier than, I mean, at this point,</p>
<p>we stayed too long and it&rsquo;s obvious,</p>
<p>the data, the investment, nothing is working.</p>
<p>The very little data points to us staying there.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m more interested in being in a relation,</p>
<p>let me take it back to a safer place again,</p>
<p>being in a relationship</p>
<p>and getting out of that relationship</p>
<p>while things are still good,</p>
<p>but you have a sense that it&rsquo;s not going to end up</p>
<p>in a good place.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the difficult thing.</p>
<p>You have to ask yourself, whether it&rsquo;s a relationship</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re talking about policymaking</p>
<p>in a place like Afghanistan,</p>
<p>are the things I&rsquo;m doing showing me evidence,</p>
<p>real evidence that they&rsquo;re making things better</p>
<p>or making things worse?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a hard question to answer.</p>
<p>You have to be very honest.</p>
<p>And in a policymaking context,</p>
<p>we have to actually do the same thing</p>
<p>we do in a relationship context.</p>
<p>What do we do in a relationship context?</p>
<p>We ask other friends who are observing.</p>
<p>We ask for other observers.</p>
<p>This is actually just a scientific method element actually</p>
<p>that we can&rsquo;t, the Heisenberg principle,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t see it because I&rsquo;m too close to it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m changing it by my looking at it.</p>
<p>I need others to tell me in a policymaking context,</p>
<p>this is why you need to hear from other people,</p>
<p>not just the generals,</p>
<p>because here&rsquo;s the thing about the generals.</p>
<p>They generally are patriotic, hardworking people,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re too close.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not lying.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re too close.</p>
<p>I just think they can do better.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>How do you think about the Cold War now</p>
<p>from the beginning to end,</p>
<p>and maybe also with an eye towards</p>
<p>the current potential cyber conflict,</p>
<p>cyber war with China and with Russia,</p>
<p>if we look sort of other kind of Cold Wars</p>
<p>potentially emerging in the 21st century,</p>
<p>when you look back at the Cold War of the 20th century,</p>
<p>how do you see it and what lessons do we draw from it?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a wonderful question</p>
<p>because I teach this to undergraduates</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s really interesting to see how undergraduates now,</p>
<p>almost all of whom were born after 9 11.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So the Cold War is ancient history to them.</p>
<p>In fact, the Cold War to them is as far removed</p>
<p>as the 1950s were to me.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s unbelievable.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like World War II for my generation</p>
<p>and Cold War for them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so far removed.</p>
<p>The collapse of the Soviet Union</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t mean anything to them.</p>
<p>So how do you describe the Cold War to them?</p>
<p>How do you describe the Soviet Union to them?</p>
<p>First of all, I have to explain to them</p>
<p>why people were so fearful of communism.</p>
<p>Anti communism is very hard for them to understand.</p>
<p>The fact that in the 1950s,</p>
<p>Americans believed that communists</p>
<p>were going to infiltrate our society</p>
<p>and many other societies.</p>
<p>And that after Fidel Castro comes to power in 1959,</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re going to see communist regimes</p>
<p>all across Latin America,</p>
<p>that fear of communism married to nuclear power.</p>
<p>And then even the fear that maybe economically</p>
<p>they would outpace us because they would create</p>
<p>this sort of army of Khrushchevian builders of things</p>
<p>and what does Khrushchev said, right?</p>
<p>Say we&rsquo;re gonna catch Britain in five years</p>
<p>and then the United States after that, right?</p>
<p>So to explain that sense of fear to them</p>
<p>that they don&rsquo;t have of those others,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really important.</p>
<p>The Cold War was fundamentally about the United States</p>
<p>defending a capitalist world order</p>
<p>against a serious challenger from communism.</p>
<p>An alternative way of organizing everything,</p>
<p>private property, economic activity,</p>
<p>enterprise, life, everything,</p>
<p>organized in a totally different way.</p>
<p>It was a struggle between two systems.</p>
<p>So your sense is, and sorry to interrupt,</p>
<p>but your sense is that the conflict of the Cold War</p>
<p>was between two ideologies</p>
<p>and not just two big countries with nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>I think it was about two different ways of life</p>
<p>or two different promoted ways of life.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union never actually lived communism.</p>
<p>But I think my reading of Stalin</p>
<p>is he really tried to go there.</p>
<p>Khrushchev really believed Gorbachev</p>
<p>thought he was going to reform the Soviet Union</p>
<p>so you would go back to a kind of Bukhar and Lenin</p>
<p>communism, right?</p>
<p>So I do think that mattered.</p>
<p>I do think that mattered enormously.</p>
<p>And for the United States point of view,</p>
<p>the view was that communism and fascism</p>
<p>were these totalitarian threats</p>
<p>to liberal democracy and capitalism,</p>
<p>which went hand in hand.</p>
<p>So I do think that&rsquo;s what the struggle was about.</p>
<p>And in a certain way, liberal capitalism</p>
<p>proved to be the more enduring system</p>
<p>and the United States played a key role in that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the reality of the Cold War.</p>
<p>But I think it means different things now</p>
<p>to my students and others.</p>
<p>They focus very much on the expansion of American power</p>
<p>and the challenges of managing.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re looking at it from the perspective</p>
<p>of not will we survive,</p>
<p>but did we waste our resources on some elements of it?</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t mean they were against what America did,</p>
<p>but there is a question of the resources</p>
<p>that went into the Cold War and the opportunity costs.</p>
<p>And you see this when you look at the sort of</p>
<p>healthcare systems that other countries build</p>
<p>and you compare them to the United States, race issues also.</p>
<p>So they look at the costs,</p>
<p>which I think often happens after a project is done,</p>
<p>you look back at that.</p>
<p>Second, I think they&rsquo;re also more inclined</p>
<p>to see the world as less bipolar,</p>
<p>to see the role of China as more complicated.</p>
<p>Post colonial or anti colonial movements,</p>
<p>independent states in Africa and Latin America,</p>
<p>that gets more attention.</p>
<p>So one of the criticisms now is because you forget</p>
<p>the lessons of 20th century history</p>
<p>and the atrocities committed under communism,</p>
<p>that you may be a little bit more willing</p>
<p>to accept some of those ideologies</p>
<p>into our United States society.</p>
<p>That this kind of, that forgetting that capitalistic forces</p>
<p>are part of the reason why we have what we have today.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a fear amongst some now that we would have,</p>
<p>what would allow basically communism</p>
<p>to take hold in America.</p>
<p>I mean, Jordan and others speak to this kind of idea.</p>
<p>I tend to not be so fearful of it.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s on the surface, it&rsquo;s not deep within.</p>
<p>I do see the world as very complicated</p>
<p>as there needing to be a role of having support</p>
<p>for each other on certain political levels,</p>
<p>economic levels, and then also supporting entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like that the kind of enforcing of outcomes</p>
<p>that is fundamental to the communist system</p>
<p>is not something we&rsquo;re actually close to.</p>
<p>And some of that is just fear mongering</p>
<p>for likes on Twitter kind of thing.</p>
<p>If I could come in on that,</p>
<p>because I agree with you 100%.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve spent a lot of time writing and looking at this</p>
<p>and talking to people about this.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no communism in the United States.</p>
<p>There never has been, and there certainly isn&rsquo;t now.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll say this both from an academic point of view,</p>
<p>but also from just spending a lot of time</p>
<p>observing young people in the United States.</p>
<p>Even those on the farthest left,</p>
<p>take whoever you think is the farthest left,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t even understand what communism is.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not communist in any sense.</p>
<p>Americans are raised in a vernacular</p>
<p>and environment of private property ownership.</p>
<p>And as you know better than anyone,</p>
<p>if you believe in private property,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t believe in communism.</p>
<p>So the sort of Bernie Sanders kind of socialist elements,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s very different, right?</p>
<p>And I would say some of that, not all of that,</p>
<p>some of that does hearken back</p>
<p>to actually what won in the Cold War.</p>
<p>There were many social democratic elements</p>
<p>of what the United States did</p>
<p>that led to our winning the Cold War.</p>
<p>For example, the New Deal was investing government money</p>
<p>in propping up business, in propping up labor unions.</p>
<p>And during the Cold War, we spent more money</p>
<p>than we had ever spent in our history on infrastructure,</p>
<p>on schools, on providing social support, social security,</p>
<p>our national pension system being one of them.</p>
<p>So you could argue actually that social democracy</p>
<p>is very compatible with capitalism.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s the debate we&rsquo;re having today,</p>
<p>how much social democracy.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll also say that the capitalism we&rsquo;ve experienced</p>
<p>the last 20 years is different</p>
<p>from the capitalism of the Cold War.</p>
<p>During the Cold War, there was the presumption</p>
<p>in the United States that you had to pay taxes</p>
<p>to support our Cold War activities,</p>
<p>that it was okay to make money,</p>
<p>but the more money you made, the more taxes you had to pay.</p>
<p>We had the highest marginal tax rates</p>
<p>in our history during the Cold War.</p>
<p>Now, the aversion to taxes,</p>
<p>and of course, no one ever likes paying taxes,</p>
<p>but the notion that we can do things on deficit spending,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a post Cold War phenomenon.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not a Cold War phenomenon.</p>
<p>So, so much of the capitalism that we&rsquo;re talking about today</p>
<p>is not the capitalism of the Cold War.</p>
<p>And maybe, again, we can learn that</p>
<p>and see how we can reform capitalism today</p>
<p>and get rid of this false worry</p>
<p>about communism in the United States.</p>
<p>Yeah, you know what?</p>
<p>You make me actually realize something important.</p>
<p>What we have to remember is the words we use</p>
<p>on the surface about different policies,</p>
<p>what you think is right and wrong,</p>
<p>is actually different than the core thing</p>
<p>that is in your blood, the core ideas that are there.</p>
<p>I do see the United States as this,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s this fire that burns of individual freedoms,</p>
<p>of property rights, these basic foundational ideas</p>
<p>that everybody just kind of takes for granted.</p>
<p>And I think if you hold on to them,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re like raised in them,</p>
<p>talking about ideas of social security,</p>
<p>of universal basic income, of reallocation of resources</p>
<p>is a fundamentally different kind of discussion</p>
<p>than you had in the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>I think the value of the individual</p>
<p>is so core to the American system</p>
<p>that you basically cannot possibly do the kind of atrocities</p>
<p>that you saw in the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>But, of course, you never know,</p>
<p>the slippery slope has a way of changing things.</p>
<p>But I do believe the things you&rsquo;re born with</p>
<p>is just so core to this country.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s part of the, I don&rsquo;t know what your thoughts are.</p>
<p>We are in Texas, I&rsquo;m not necessarily,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t necessarily wanna have</p>
<p>a gun control type of conversation,</p>
<p>but the reason I really like guns,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t make any sense, but philosophically,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s such a declaration of individual rights</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s so different than the conversations I hear</p>
<p>with my Russian family and my Russian friends,</p>
<p>that the gun, it&rsquo;s very possible</p>
<p>that having guns is bad for society</p>
<p>in the sense that it will lead to more violence.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s something about this discussion</p>
<p>that proclaims the value of my freedom as an individual.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not being eloquent in it,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s very few debates</p>
<p>where whenever people are saying,</p>
<p>should you have what level of gun control,</p>
<p>all those kinds of things,</p>
<p>what I hear is it&rsquo;s a fight for how much freedom,</p>
<p>even if it&rsquo;s stupid freedom, should the individual have.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s articulated quite often.</p>
<p>I think combining your two points, which are great points,</p>
<p>I think there is something about American individualism</p>
<p>which is deeply ingrained in our culture and our society.</p>
<p>And it means that the kinds of bad things</p>
<p>that happen are different, usually not as bad.</p>
<p>But our individualism often covers up</p>
<p>for vigilante activity and individual violence</p>
<p>toward people that you wouldn&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>in a more collective culture.</p>
<p>So in the Soviet Union, it was at a much worse scale</p>
<p>and it was done by government organizations.</p>
<p>In the United States, it&rsquo;s individuals,</p>
<p>the history of lynching in our country, for example.</p>
<p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s individual police officers,</p>
<p>sometimes it&rsquo;s others.</p>
<p>Again, the vast majority of police officers are good people</p>
<p>and don&rsquo;t do harm to people, but there are these examples</p>
<p>and they are able to fester in our society</p>
<p>because of our individualism.</p>
<p>Now, gun ownership is about personal freedom,</p>
<p>I think, for a lot of people.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s no doubt that in our history,</p>
<p>included in the Second Amendment,</p>
<p>which can be interpreted in different ways,</p>
<p>is the presumption that people should have the right</p>
<p>to defend themselves,</p>
<p>which is what I think you&rsquo;re getting at here.</p>
<p>That you should not be completely dependent</p>
<p>for your defense on an entity</p>
<p>that might not be there for you.</p>
<p>You should be able to defend yourself.</p>
<p>And guns symbolize that.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a fair point.</p>
<p>But I think it&rsquo;s also a fair point to say</p>
<p>that as with everything,</p>
<p>defining what self defense is, is really important.</p>
<p>So does self defense mean I can have a bazooka?</p>
<p>Does it mean I can have weapons that are designed</p>
<p>for a military battlefield to mass kill people?</p>
<p>That seems to me to be very different</p>
<p>from saying I should have a handgun</p>
<p>or some small arm to defend myself.</p>
<p>That distinction alone would make a huge difference.</p>
<p>Most of the mass shootings, at least,</p>
<p>which are a smaller proportion of the larger gun deaths</p>
<p>in the United States, which are larger</p>
<p>than any other society, but at least the mass shootings</p>
<p>are usually perpetrated by people</p>
<p>who have not self defense weapons,</p>
<p>but mass killing, mass killing weapons.</p>
<p>And I think there&rsquo;s an important distinction there.</p>
<p>The Constitution talks about a right to bear arms</p>
<p>for a well regulated militia.</p>
<p>When the framers talked about arms,</p>
<p>that did not mean the ability to kill</p>
<p>as many people as you wanna kill.</p>
<p>It meant the ability to defend yourself.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s have that conversation.</p>
<p>I think it would be useful as a society.</p>
<p>Stop talking about guns or no guns.</p>
<p>What is it that we as citizens need</p>
<p>to feel we can defend ourselves?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, guns have this complicated issue</p>
<p>that it can cause harm to others.</p>
<p>I tend to see sort of maybe like legalization of drugs.</p>
<p>I tend to believe that we should have the freedom</p>
<p>to do stupid things.</p>
<p>Yeah, so long as we&rsquo;re not harming lots of other people.</p>
<p>Yes, and then guns, of course, have the property</p>
<p>that they can be used.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just a bazooka I would argue is pretty stupid</p>
<p>to own for your own self defense,</p>
<p>but it has the very negative side effect</p>
<p>of being potentially used to harm other people.</p>
<p>And you have to consider that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>By the way, as a side note to the listeners,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s been a bunch of people saying</p>
<p>that Lex is way too libertarian for my taste.</p>
<p>No, I actually am just struggling with ideas</p>
<p>and sometimes put on different hats in these conversations.</p>
<p>I think through different ideas,</p>
<p>whether they&rsquo;re left, right or libertarian.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true for gun control.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true for immigration.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true for all of that.</p>
<p>I think we should have discussions in the space of ideas</p>
<p>versus in the space of bins we put each other in labels</p>
<p>and we put each other in.</p>
<p>I agree 100%.</p>
<p>And also change our minds all the time.</p>
<p>Try out, say stupid stuff with the best of intention,</p>
<p>trying our best to think through it.</p>
<p>And then after saying it, think about it for a few days</p>
<p>and then change your mind and grow in this way.</p>
<p>Let me ask a ridiculous question.</p>
<p>When you zoom out, when human civilization</p>
<p>has destroyed itself and alien graduate students</p>
<p>are studying it like three, four, five centuries from now,</p>
<p>what do you think we&rsquo;ll remember</p>
<p>about this period in history?</p>
<p>The 20th century, the 21st century, this time.</p>
<p>We had a couple of wars.</p>
<p>We had a charismatic black president in the United States.</p>
<p>We had a couple of pandemics.</p>
<p>What do you think will actually stand out in history?</p>
<p>No doubt the rapid technological innovation</p>
<p>of the last 20 to 30 years.</p>
<p>How we created a whole virtual universe</p>
<p>we didn&rsquo;t have before.</p>
<p>And of course that&rsquo;s gonna go in directions</p>
<p>you and I can&rsquo;t imagine 50 years from now.</p>
<p>But this will be seen as that origin moment</p>
<p>that when we went from playing below the rim</p>
<p>to playing above the rim, right?</p>
<p>To be all in person to having a whole virtual world.</p>
<p>And in a strange way, the pandemic was a provocation</p>
<p>to move even further in that direction.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re never going back, right?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna restore some of the things we were doing</p>
<p>before the pandemic, but we&rsquo;re never gonna go back</p>
<p>to that world we were in before where every meeting</p>
<p>you had to fly to that place to be in the room</p>
<p>with the people.</p>
<p>So this whole virtual world and the virtual personas</p>
<p>and the avatars and all of that,</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s going to be a big part</p>
<p>of how people remember our time.</p>
<p>Also the sort of biotechnology element of it,</p>
<p>which the vaccines are part of.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s amazing how quickly, this is the great triumph,</p>
<p>how quickly we&rsquo;ve produced and distributed these vaccines.</p>
<p>And of course there are problems with who&rsquo;s taking them,</p>
<p>but the reality is, I mean, this is light speed</p>
<p>compared to what it would have been like,</p>
<p>not just in 1918, in 1980.</p>
<p>Yeah, one of the, I&rsquo;m sorry if I&rsquo;m interrupting,</p>
<p>but one of the disappointing things</p>
<p>about this particular time is because vaccines,</p>
<p>like a lot of things got politicized,</p>
<p>used as little pawns in the game of politics,</p>
<p>that we don&rsquo;t get the chance to step back fully at least</p>
<p>and celebrate the brilliance of the human species.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Yes, there are scientists who use their authority</p>
<p>improperly, that have an ego,</p>
<p>that when they&rsquo;re within institutions,</p>
<p>are dishonest with the public</p>
<p>because they don&rsquo;t trust the intelligence of the public,</p>
<p>they are not authentic and transparent,</p>
<p>all the same things you could say about humans</p>
<p>in any positions of power, anywhere.</p>
<p>Okay, that doesn&rsquo;t mean science isn&rsquo;t incredible</p>
<p>and the vaccines, I mean, I don&rsquo;t often talk about it</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s so political and it&rsquo;s heartbreaking to,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s heartbreaking how all the good stuff</p>
<p>is getting politicized.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s right, and it shouldn&rsquo;t be,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;ll seem less political.</p>
<p>Eating the long arc of history.</p>
<p>Yep, it&rsquo;ll be seen as an outstanding accomplishment.</p>
<p>And as a step toward whatever,</p>
<p>maybe they&rsquo;re doing vaccines</p>
<p>or something that replaces the vaccine in 10 seconds,</p>
<p>at that point, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll be seen as a step.</p>
<p>Those will be some of the positives.</p>
<p>I think one of the negatives they will point to</p>
<p>will be our inability, at least at this moment,</p>
<p>to manage our environment better,</p>
<p>how we&rsquo;re destroying our living space</p>
<p>and not doing enough even though we have the capabilities</p>
<p>to do more to preserve</p>
<p>or at least allow a sustainable living space.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m confident because I&rsquo;m an optimist</p>
<p>that we will get through this</p>
<p>and we will be better at sustaining our environment</p>
<p>in future decades.</p>
<p>And so in terms of environmental policy,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll see this moment as a dark age</p>
<p>or the beginnings of a better age, maybe as a renaissance.</p>
<p>Or maybe as the last time most people lived on Earth</p>
<p>when a couple of centuries afterwards</p>
<p>we were all dissipated throughout the solar system</p>
<p>and the galaxy.</p>
<p>Very possible.</p>
<p>If the local resident, hometown resident,</p>
<p>Mr. Elon Musk has anything to do with it.</p>
<p>I do tend to think you&rsquo;re absolutely right.</p>
<p>With all this political bickering,</p>
<p>we shouldn&rsquo;t forget that what this age will be remembered by</p>
<p>is the incredible levels of innovation.</p>
<p>I do think the biotech stuff worries me more than anything</p>
<p>because it feels like there&rsquo;s a lot of weapons</p>
<p>that could be yet to be developed in that space.</p>
<p>But I tend to believe that,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m excited by two avenues.</p>
<p>One is artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>The kind of systems we&rsquo;ll create in this digital space</p>
<p>that you mentioned we&rsquo;re moving to.</p>
<p>And then the other, of course,</p>
<p>this could be the product of the Cold War,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m super excited by space exploration.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a magic to humans being.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re getting back to it.</p>
<p>I mean, we were enthralled with it in the 50s and 60s</p>
<p>when it was a Cold War competition.</p>
<p>And then after the 70s, we sort of gave up on it.</p>
<p>And thanks to Elon Musk and others,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re coming back to this issue.</p>
<p>And I think there&rsquo;s so much to be gained</p>
<p>from the power of exploration.</p>
<p>Is there books or movies in your life,</p>
<p>long ago or recently, that had a big impact on you?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Is there something you would?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>My favorite novel, I always tell people this,</p>
<p>I love reading novels.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a historian.</p>
<p>And I think the historian and the novelist are actually,</p>
<p>and the technology innovator are all actually</p>
<p>one and the same.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all storytellers.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re all in the imagination space.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m trying to imagine the world of the past</p>
<p>to inform us in the present for the future.</p>
<p>So one of my favorite novels that I read,</p>
<p>actually when I was in graduate school,</p>
<p>is Thomas Mann&rsquo;s Buddenbrooks.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s the story of a family in L√ºbeck</p>
<p>in Northern Germany, living through the 19th century</p>
<p>and the rise and fall of family, cycles of life.</p>
<p>Many things we&rsquo;ve talked about in the last couple of hours.</p>
<p>Cycles of life, challenges of adjusting</p>
<p>to the world around you.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just a very moving reflection</p>
<p>on the limits of human agency</p>
<p>and how we all have to understand the circumstances</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re in and adjust to them.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s triumph and tragedy in that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a wonderful novel.</p>
<p>It used to be a kind of canonical work.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sort of fallen out now.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a big, big novel, but I&rsquo;m very moved by that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very moved by Tall Stories, War and Peace.</p>
<p>I assign that every year to my students.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a big, big book.</p>
<p>But what Tall Story challenges</p>
<p>is he challenges the notion</p>
<p>that a Napoleon can rule the world.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re all little Napoleons, right?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re all sort of thinking that we&rsquo;re gonna do that.</p>
<p>And he reminds us how much is contingency, circumstance.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t mean we don&rsquo;t have some control.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve spoke to me a little bit of Russian.</p>
<p>Where does that come from?</p>
<p>So your appreciation of Tall Story,</p>
<p>but also your ability to speak a bit of Russian.</p>
<p>Where&rsquo;s that from?</p>
<p>So I speak, in addition to English,</p>
<p>I speak reasonably well,</p>
<p>depending on how much vodka I&rsquo;ve had.</p>
<p>Russian, I speak French and German.</p>
<p>I learned those for research purposes.</p>
<p>I learned French actually when I was in high school,</p>
<p>Russian when I was in college,</p>
<p>German when I was in graduate school.</p>
<p>Now I do have family on my mother&rsquo;s side</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s of Russian Jewish extraction,</p>
<p>but they were Yiddish speakers by the time I met them.</p>
<p>By the time they had gone through Germany</p>
<p>and come to the United States,</p>
<p>or really gone through Poland and come to the United States,</p>
<p>they were Yiddish speakers.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s no one really in my family who speaks Russian,</p>
<p>but I do feel a connection there,</p>
<p>at least a long range personal connection.</p>
<p>Is there something to be said about the language</p>
<p>and your ability to imagine history?</p>
<p>Sort of when you study these different countries,</p>
<p>your ability to imagine what it was like</p>
<p>to be a part of that culture, part of that time?</p>
<p>Yes, language is crucial to understanding a culture.</p>
<p>And even if you learn the languages I have,</p>
<p>learning Russian and German and French,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s still not the same</p>
<p>as also being a native speaker either, as you know.</p>
<p>But I think language tells you a lot about mannerism,</p>
<p>about assumptions.</p>
<p>The very fact that English doesn&rsquo;t have a formal U,</p>
<p>but Russian has a formal U, right?</p>
<p>V versus T, right?</p>
<p>German has a formal U, Z versus D, right?</p>
<p>So the fact that English doesn&rsquo;t have a formal U</p>
<p>tells you something about Americans, right?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s just one example.</p>
<p>The fact that Germans have such a wider vocabulary</p>
<p>for certain scientific concepts than we have in English</p>
<p>tells you something about the culture, right?</p>
<p>Language is an artifact of the culture.</p>
<p>The culture makes the language.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fascinating to explore.</p>
<p>I mean, even just exactly what you just said,</p>
<p>V, T, which is, there&rsquo;s a fascinating transition.</p>
<p>So I guess in English we just have U.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a fascinating transition that persists to this day</p>
<p>is of formalism and politeness,</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s an initial kind of dance of interaction</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s different methods of signaling respect, I guess.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t, and language provides that,</p>
<p>and then in the English language,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s fewer tools to show that kind of respect,</p>
<p>which has potentially positive or negative effects</p>
<p>on, it flattens the society where like a teenager</p>
<p>could talk to an older person and show like a deference.</p>
<p>I mean, but at the same time,</p>
<p>I mean, it creates a certain kind of dynamic,</p>
<p>a certain kind of society.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s funny to think of just like those few words</p>
<p>can have like a ripple effect through the whole culture.</p>
<p>And we don&rsquo;t have a history in the United States</p>
<p>of aristocracy.</p>
<p>These elements of language reflect aristocracy.</p>
<p>The serf would never refer to the master,</p>
<p>even if the master is younger,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s always Voi, right?</p>
<p>In Turgenev, it&rsquo;s always Voi, right?</p>
<p>I mean, and so it&rsquo;s, yeah,</p>
<p>so it tells you something about the history.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why to your question, which was a great question,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so crucial to try to penetrate the language.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll also say something else,</p>
<p>and this is a problem for many Americans</p>
<p>who haven&rsquo;t learned a foreign language.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re very bad at teaching foreign languages.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve never taught yourself a foreign language,</p>
<p>you have closed yourself off to certain kinds of empathy</p>
<p>because you have basically trained your brain</p>
<p>to only look at the world one way.</p>
<p>The very act of learning another language,</p>
<p>I think tells your brain that words and concepts</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t translate one to one.</p>
<p>This is the first thing you realize, right?</p>
<p>We can say, you know, these two words mean this thing,</p>
<p>you know, these two words mean the same thing</p>
<p>from two languages, they never mean exactly the same thing.</p>
<p>Dosvidanya is really not goodbye, right?</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s something, you know,</p>
<p>right now there&rsquo;s people talking about</p>
<p>idea of lived experience.</p>
<p>One of the ways to force yourself into this idea</p>
<p>of lived experience is by learning another language,</p>
<p>to understand that you can perceive the world</p>
<p>in a totally different way,</p>
<p>even though you&rsquo;re perceiving the same thing.</p>
<p>And of course, the way to first learn Russian</p>
<p>for those looking for tutorial lessons for me</p>
<p>is just like as you said, we start by drinking lots of vodka.</p>
<p>Yes, of course.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very difficult to do otherwise.</p>
<p>Is there advice you have for young people about career,</p>
<p>about life, in making their way in the world?</p>
<p>Yes, two things I believe that I say</p>
<p>to a lot of talented young people.</p>
<p>First, I don&rsquo;t think you can predict</p>
<p>what is gonna be well renumerated 20 years from now.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t pick a profession because you think,</p>
<p>even though your parents might tell you or something,</p>
<p>do this and you&rsquo;ll make money.</p>
<p>You know, this is the scene in The Graduate</p>
<p>where a guy tells Dustin Hoffman,</p>
<p>go into plastics, money in plastics.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>So many of my students now have parents</p>
<p>who are telling them, bright students, you know,</p>
<p>go to the business school.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s gonna set you up to make money.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re passionate about business, yes.</p>
<p>But don&rsquo;t begin by thinking you know</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s gonna be hot 20 years from now.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s gonna be hot from 20 years ago,</p>
<p>20 years from now.</p>
<p>What should you do?</p>
<p>This is advice number one.</p>
<p>Find what you&rsquo;re passionate about.</p>
<p>Because if you&rsquo;re passionate about it,</p>
<p>you will do good work in that area if you&rsquo;re talented</p>
<p>and usually passion and talent overlap.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ll find a way to get people to pay you for it.</p>
<p>I mean, you do it really well, people will wanna pay.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where capitalism works.</p>
<p>People will find it valuable, right?</p>
<p>Whether it&rsquo;s violin playing, right?</p>
<p>Or engineering or poetry, you will find,</p>
<p>you might not become a billionaire.</p>
<p>That involves other things.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;ll find a way to get people to pay you for it.</p>
<p>And then the second thing is it&rsquo;s really important</p>
<p>at the very beginning of your career,</p>
<p>even before you&rsquo;re in your job, right?</p>
<p>To start building your networks.</p>
<p>But networks are not just people you&rsquo;re on Facebook with</p>
<p>or Twitter with, I mean, that&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually forming relationships.</p>
<p>And some of that can be mediated in the digital world,</p>
<p>but I mean real relationships.</p>
<p>I like podcasts because I think</p>
<p>they actually open up that space.</p>
<p>I know a lot of people can listen to a podcast</p>
<p>and find someone else who&rsquo;s listened to that podcast</p>
<p>and have a conversation about a topic.</p>
<p>It opens up that space.</p>
<p>Build those relationships,</p>
<p>not with people who you think will be powerful,</p>
<p>but people you think are interesting</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;ll do interesting things.</p>
<p>And every successful person I know at some level</p>
<p>had a key moment where they got where they are</p>
<p>because of someone they knew for some other reason</p>
<p>who had that connection.</p>
<p>So use and spread your networks</p>
<p>and make them as diverse as possible.</p>
<p>Find people who are of a different party,</p>
<p>have different interests, but are interesting to you.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s brilliant advice.</p>
<p>And some of that on the passion side,</p>
<p>I do find that as somebody who has a lot of passions,</p>
<p>I find the second part to that is committing.</p>
<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s true too.</p>
<p>Which sucks because life is finite.</p>
<p>And when you commit, you say,</p>
<p>well, I&rsquo;m never going to be good.</p>
<p>Like when you choose one of the two passions,</p>
<p>one of the two things you&rsquo;re interested in,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re basically saying, I&rsquo;m letting go.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m saying goodbye to.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>Which is actually what does goodbye means,</p>
<p>not goodbye, but letting go.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s exactly right.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s exactly right.</p>
<p>I think you do have to make choices.</p>
<p>You do have to set priorities.</p>
<p>I often laugh at students who tell me</p>
<p>they want to have like three majors.</p>
<p>If you have three majors, you have no major, right?</p>
<p>I mean, so I do think you have to make choices.</p>
<p>I also think it&rsquo;s important that whatever you do,</p>
<p>even if it&rsquo;s a small thing,</p>
<p>you always do the best you can.</p>
<p>You always do excellent work.</p>
<p>My kids are tired of hearing me say this at home,</p>
<p>but I believe everything you do should be about excellence.</p>
<p>The best you can do.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m going to wash the dishes,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to be the best person washing the dishes.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m going to write a book review,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to write the best possible book review I can.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because you develop a culture about yourself,</p>
<p>which is about excellence.</p>
<p>Yeah, I was telling you offline about all the kind of stuff,</p>
<p>Google Fiber and cable installation, all that stuff.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been always a believer, washing dishes.</p>
<p>People don&rsquo;t often believe me when I say this.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care what I do.</p>
<p>I am with David Foster Wallace.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m unborable.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so much joy for me.</p>
<p>I think for everyone, but okay, let me just speak for me,</p>
<p>to be discovered in getting really good at anything.</p>
<p>In fact, getting good at stuff</p>
<p>that most people believe is boring or menial labor</p>
<p>or impossible to be interesting,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s even more joyful to find the joy within that</p>
<p>and the excellence.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the Jiro dreams of sushi,</p>
<p>making the same fricking sushi over and over</p>
<p>and becoming a master that can be truly joyful.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a sense of pride and on the pragmatic level,</p>
<p>you never know when someone will spot that.</p>
<p>And intelligent people who perform</p>
<p>at the level of high excellence look for others.</p>
<p>Who do you say?</p>
<p>And it radiates some kind of signal.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s weird.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s weird what you attract to yourself</p>
<p>when you just focus on mastery</p>
<p>and pursuing excellence in something.</p>
<p>Like this is the cool thing about it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the joy I&rsquo;ve really truly experienced.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t have to do much work.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just cool people kind of,</p>
<p>I find myself in groups of cool people,</p>
<p>like really people who are excited about life,</p>
<p>who are passionate about life.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a fire in their eyes.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s at the end of the day just makes life fun.</p>
<p>And then also money wise,</p>
<p>at least in this society,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re fortunate to where if you do that kind of thing,</p>
<p>money will find a way.</p>
<p>Like I have the great,</p>
<p>I say this that I don&rsquo;t care about money.</p>
<p>I have to think about what that means</p>
<p>because some people criticize that idea.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, yeah, it must be nice to say that.</p>
<p>Cause I have for much,</p>
<p>many periods of my life had very little money,</p>
<p>but I think we live in a society</p>
<p>where not caring about money,</p>
<p>but just focusing on your passions.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re truly pursuing excellence, whatever that is,</p>
<p>money will find you.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s I guess the ideal of the capitalist system.</p>
<p>And I think that the entrepreneurs I&rsquo;ve studied</p>
<p>and had the chance to get to know,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;d agree with this,</p>
<p>they do what they do</p>
<p>cause they&rsquo;re passionate about the product.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not just in it to make money.</p>
<p>In fact, that&rsquo;s when they get into trouble</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re just trying to make money.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>You said your grandmother, Emily,</p>
<p>had a big impact on your life.</p>
<p>She lived to 102.</p>
<p>What are some lessons she taught you?</p>
<p>Emily, who was the child of immigrants</p>
<p>from Russia and Poland,</p>
<p>who never went to college,</p>
<p>her proudest day I think was when I went to college.</p>
<p>She treated everyone with respect</p>
<p>and tried to get to know everyone.</p>
<p>She knew every bus driver in the town.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;d remember their birthdays.</p>
<p>And one of the things she taught me is</p>
<p>no matter how high you fly,</p>
<p>the lowest person close to the ground matters to you.</p>
<p>And you treat them the same way</p>
<p>you treat the billionaire at the top of the podium.</p>
<p>And she did that.</p>
<p>She didn&rsquo;t just say that.</p>
<p>Some people say that and don&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>She really did that.</p>
<p>And I always remember that it comes up in my mind</p>
<p>at least once a week</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re all busy doing a lot of things</p>
<p>and you either see or you even feel in yourself</p>
<p>the desire to just, for the reasons of speed,</p>
<p>to be short or not polite with someone</p>
<p>who can&rsquo;t do anything to harm you right now.</p>
<p>And I remember her saying to me,</p>
<p>no, you don&rsquo;t, you treat everyone with respect.</p>
<p>You treat the person you&rsquo;re on the phone with,</p>
<p>customer service.</p>
<p>You treat that person if you&rsquo;re talking to Jeff Bezos</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re talking to Elon Musk.</p>
<p>And I think making that a culture</p>
<p>of who you are is so important.</p>
<p>And people notice that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the other thing.</p>
<p>And they notice when it&rsquo;s authentic.</p>
<p>Everyone&rsquo;s nice to the person at the bottom</p>
<p>of the totem pole when you want to get ahead in the line</p>
<p>for your driver&rsquo;s license.</p>
<p>But are you nice to them when you don&rsquo;t need that?</p>
<p>They notice that.</p>
<p>And even when nobody&rsquo;s watching,</p>
<p>that has a weird effect on you</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to have a ripple effect and people know.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the cool thing about the internet.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve come to believe that people see authenticity.</p>
<p>They see when you&rsquo;re full of shit, when you&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>The other thing that Emily taught me,</p>
<p>and I think we&rsquo;ve all had relatives who have taught us this,</p>
<p>that you could be very uneducated.</p>
<p>She was very uneducated.</p>
<p>She had a high school diploma,</p>
<p>but I think she was working in a delicatessen in New York</p>
<p>while she was in high school,</p>
<p>or maybe it was at Gimbels or somebody.</p>
<p>So she probably didn&rsquo;t take high school very seriously.</p>
<p>She wasn&rsquo;t very well educated.</p>
<p>She was very smart.</p>
<p>And we can fall into a world</p>
<p>where I&rsquo;m a big believer in higher education</p>
<p>and getting a PhD and things of that sort,</p>
<p>but where we think those are the only smart people.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Sometimes those are the people,</p>
<p>because of their accomplishments,</p>
<p>because their egos are the ones</p>
<p>who are least educated in the way of the world.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Least curious, and ultimately wisdom comes from curiosity.</p>
<p>And sometimes getting a PhD can get in the way of curiosity</p>
<p>as opposed to empower curiosity.</p>
<p>Let me ask, from a historical perspective,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve studied some of human history.</p>
<p>So maybe you have an insight</p>
<p>about what&rsquo;s the meaning of life.</p>
<p>Do you ever ask when you look at history, the why?</p>
<p>Yeah, I do all the time, and I don&rsquo;t have an answer.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the mystery that we can&rsquo;t answer.</p>
<p>I do think what it means is what we make of it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no universal, every period I&rsquo;ve studied,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve studied a little bit of a lot of periods</p>
<p>and a lot of a few periods,</p>
<p>every period people struggle with this,</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t come to,</p>
<p>wiser people than us don&rsquo;t come to a firm answer,</p>
<p>except it&rsquo;s what you make of it.</p>
<p>Meaning is what you make of it.</p>
<p>So think about what you want to care about</p>
<p>and make that the meaning in your life.</p>
<p>I wonder how that changes throughout human history,</p>
<p>whether there&rsquo;s a constant.</p>
<p>Like I often think,</p>
<p>especially when you study evolutionary biology</p>
<p>and you just see our origins from life and as it evolves,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, it makes you wonder,</p>
<p>it feels like there&rsquo;s a thread that connects all of it,</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re headed somewhere.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re trying to actualize some greater purpose.</p>
<p>Like there seems to be a direction to this thing,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re all kind of stumbling in the dark</p>
<p>trying to figure it out,</p>
<p>but it feels like we eventually will find an answer.</p>
<p>I hope so, yeah, maybe.</p>
<p>I mean, I do think we all want our families to do better.</p>
<p>We are familiar,</p>
<p>and family doesn&rsquo;t just mean biological family.</p>
<p>You can have all kinds of ways</p>
<p>you define family and community,</p>
<p>and I think we are moving slowly</p>
<p>and in a very messy way toward a larger world community.</p>
<p>To include all of biological life</p>
<p>and eventually artificial life as well.</p>
<p>Yeah, so to expand the lesson to the advice</p>
<p>that your grandmother taught you,</p>
<p>is I think we should treat robots and AI systems</p>
<p>good as well, even if they&rsquo;re currently not very intelligent</p>
<p>because one day they might be.</p>
<p>Right, right, I think that&rsquo;s exactly right,</p>
<p>and we should think through,</p>
<p>exactly as a humanist how I would approach that issue.</p>
<p>We need to think through the kinds of behavior patterns</p>
<p>we want to establish with these new forms of life,</p>
<p>artificial life for ourselves also, to your point,</p>
<p>so we behave the right way, so we don&rsquo;t misuse this.</p>
<p>We started talking about Abraham Lincoln,</p>
<p>ended talking about robots.</p>
<p>I think this is the perfect conversation, Jeremy.</p>
<p>This was a huge honor.</p>
<p>I love Austin, I love UT Austin,</p>
<p>and I love the fact that you would agree</p>
<p>to waste all your valuable time with me today.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for talking to me.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t imagine a better way to spend a Friday afternoon.</p>
<p>This was so much fun, and I&rsquo;m such a fan of your podcast</p>
<p>and delighted to be a part of it.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation</p>
<p>with Jeremy Suri, and thank you to Element, Monkpac,</p>
<p>Belcampo, Four Sigmatic, and Asleep.</p>
<p>Check them out in the description to support this podcast.</p>
<p>And now, let me leave you with some words</p>
<p>from Franklin D. Roosevelt, FDR.</p>
<p>Democracy cannot succeed unless those</p>
<p>who express their choice are prepared to choose wisely.</p>
<p>The real safeguard of democracy, therefore, is education.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.</p>
