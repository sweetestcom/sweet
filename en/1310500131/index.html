    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>The following is a conversation with Michael Malice,</p>
<p>an anarchist, political thinker, author,</p>
<p>and a proud, part time, Andy Kaufman like troll,</p>
<p>in the best sense of that word,</p>
<p>on both Twitter and in real life.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a host of a great podcast called You&rsquo;re Welcome,</p>
<p>spelled Y O U R.</p>
<p>I think that gives a sense of his sense of humor.</p>
<p>He is the author of Dear Reader,</p>
<p>the unauthorized autobiography of King Jong Il,</p>
<p>and The New Right,</p>
<p>A Journey to the Fringe of American Politics.</p>
<p>This latter book, when I read it,</p>
<p>or rather listened to it last year,</p>
<p>helped me start learning about the various</p>
<p>disparate movements that I was undereducated about,</p>
<p>from the internet trolls, to Alex Jones,</p>
<p>to white nationalists, and to techno anarchists.</p>
<p>The book is funny and brilliant, and so is Michael.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, because of a self imposed deadline,</p>
<p>I actually pulled an all nighter before this conversation.</p>
<p>So I was not exactly all there mentally,</p>
<p>even more so than usual, which is tough,</p>
<p>because Michael is really quick witted and brilliant.</p>
<p>But he was kind, patient, and understanding</p>
<p>in this conversation, and I hope you will be as well.</p>
<p>Today, I&rsquo;m trying something a little new,</p>
<p>looking to establish a regular structure for these intros.</p>
<p>A first, doing the guest intro, like I just did.</p>
<p>Second, quick one or two sentence mention of each sponsor.</p>
<p>Third, my side comments related to the episode.</p>
<p>And finally, fourth, full ad reads</p>
<p>on the audio side of things,</p>
<p>and on YouTube, going straight to the conversation.</p>
<p>So not doing the full ad reads.</p>
<p>And as always, no ads in the middle,</p>
<p>because to me, they get in the way of the conversation.</p>
<p>So, quick mention of the sponsors.</p>
<p>First, SEMrush, the most advanced</p>
<p>SEO optimization tool I&rsquo;ve ever come across.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like looking at numbers,</p>
<p>but someone probably should.</p>
<p>It helps you make good decisions.</p>
<p>Second sponsor is DoorDash, food delivery service</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve used for many years</p>
<p>to fuel long, uninterrupted sessions of deep work</p>
<p>at Google, MIT, and I still use it a lot today.</p>
<p>Third sponsor is Masterclass, online courses</p>
<p>from the best people in the world</p>
<p>on each of the topics covered,</p>
<p>from rockets, to game design, to poker,</p>
<p>to writing, and to guitar with Carlos Santana.</p>
<p>Please check out these sponsors in the description</p>
<p>to get a discount and to support this podcast.</p>
<p>As a side note, let me say that I hope to have</p>
<p>some conversations with political thinkers,</p>
<p>including liberals and conservatives,</p>
<p>anarchists, libertarians, objectivists,</p>
<p>and everything in between.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m as allergic to Trump bashing and Trump worship</p>
<p>as you probably are.</p>
<p>I have none of that in me.</p>
<p>I really work hard to be open minded</p>
<p>and let my curiosity drive the conversation.</p>
<p>I do plead with you to be patient on two counts.</p>
<p>First, I have an intense, busy life</p>
<p>outside of these podcasts.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s 4 a.m. right now as I&rsquo;m recording this.</p>
<p>So sometimes life affects these conversations,</p>
<p>like in this case, I pull an all nighter beforehand.</p>
<p>So please be patient with me if I say something</p>
<p>inelegant, confusing, dumb, or just plain wrong.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll try to correct myself on social media</p>
<p>or in future conversations as much as I can.</p>
<p>I really am always learning and working hard to improve.</p>
<p>Second, if I or the guest says something about,</p>
<p>for example, our current president, Donald Trump,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s over the top negative or over the top positive,</p>
<p>please don&rsquo;t let your brain go into the partisan mode.</p>
<p>Try to hear our words in an open minded nuanced way.</p>
<p>And if we say stuff from a place of emotion,</p>
<p>please give us a pass.</p>
<p>Nuanced conversation can only happen</p>
<p>if we&rsquo;re patient with each other.</p>
<p>If you enjoy this thing, subscribe on YouTube,</p>

<p>or connect with me on Twitter at Lex Friedman.</p>
<p>And now, here&rsquo;s my conversation with Michael Malice.</p>
<p>There was a Simpsons episode where he starts mixing</p>
<p>like sleeping pills with like pet pills</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s driving his truck and I&rsquo;m like,</p>
<p>I wanna see what happens if he mixed Red Bull</p>
<p>and Nitra cold brew.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lineup of drugs.</p>
<p>This is gonna be so fun.</p>
<p>Yeah, let&rsquo;s start with love.</p>
<p>Yeah, so one thing we&rsquo;ll eventually somehow talk about,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll be a theme throughout, is that you&rsquo;re also Russian.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>A little bit less than me, but.</p>
<p>How, why?</p>
<p>Cause I&rsquo;m from Ukraine.</p>
<p>Oh, you&rsquo;re from Ukraine?</p>
<p>From above.</p>
<p>Okay, wow.</p>
<p>No, because you came here a little bit</p>
<p>when you were younger.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I came here when I was 13,</p>
<p>so I saturated a little bit of the Russian soul.</p>
<p>I marinated in the Russian soul a little deeper.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t told anyone this,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ll be glad to tell you, Davidish.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t been back since I was two.</p>
<p>And next summer, it looks like me and my buddy,</p>
<p>Chris Williamson, who&rsquo;s also a podcaster,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s British, Modern Wisdom, he looks like Apollo.</p>
<p>Looks like we got a videographer.</p>
<p>Which Apollo?</p>
<p>Apollo Creed?</p>
<p>The god, he looks like the god Apollo.</p>
<p>Yeah, he&rsquo;s like a model.</p>
<p>I thought you were talking about Rocky.</p>
<p>So, we&rsquo;re gonna go for the first time</p>
<p>to see where I came from.</p>
<p>Which is in Ukraine.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna go to Lvov and either St. Petersburg or Moscow,</p>
<p>probably St. Petersburg, or both.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna be intense.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna be a lot of panic attacks, I feel.</p>
<p>And your Russian is okay?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>How do you think?</p>
<p>Good?</p>
<p>Do you understand?</p>
<p>No, you can&rsquo;t talk Russian in Ukraine,</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s like they get offended.</p>
<p>Yeah, but then you also wanna go to Russia.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>For me, there&rsquo;s several people in Russia</p>
<p>I wanna interview on a podcast.</p>
<p>So, one of them is Gagarin Perlman,</p>
<p>which is a mathematician, and the other person is Putin.</p>
<p>You know what my favorite Putin story is?</p>
<p>Do you know this?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>When he had Merkel with him, do you know this story?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Merkel&rsquo;s scared of dogs, like petrified of dogs.</p>
<p>So, he brings in his like black lab.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a Labrador, it&rsquo;s like the sweetest animal,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s all over her, and there&rsquo;s pictures,</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s sitting like this, and she&rsquo;s terrified,</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s like, what&rsquo;s wrong, Angela?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s just completely trolling her.</p>
<p>Yeah, he&rsquo;s aware of the sort of the narrative around him.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And then he plays with it.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>He enjoys it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very Russian thing.</p>
<p>My friend wanted to do a film about me.</p>
<p>He goes, I realized you guys aren&rsquo;t like us at all.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just like, look at us,</p>
<p>and then I started telling him stories</p>
<p>about the upbringing, and he&rsquo;s like, oh my God,</p>
<p>and as I&rsquo;m telling them, I&rsquo;m like,</p>
<p>wow, this stuff is really crazy, like how we are wired.</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s the we?</p>
<p>Your friend is?</p>
<p>The Russian, the friend&rsquo;s American.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m saying the way Russians are brought up,</p>
<p>and the way, maybe, I don&rsquo;t think it was just my family.</p>
<p>I bet you had similar things.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an example.</p>
<p>I was, I had a buddy staying with me.</p>
<p>He had a problem with his roommate,</p>
<p>so he crashed at my place, fine.</p>
<p>I went to the gym, and I come back,</p>
<p>and he goes, oh, there was,</p>
<p>and my apartment building is four four apartments,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s not like a huge thing.</p>
<p>He goes, oh, there was someone knocking at your door,</p>
<p>so I told him blah blah, and for me,</p>
<p>and I wonder if you&rsquo;re the same way,</p>
<p>if I&rsquo;m at someone&rsquo;s house that&rsquo;s not my own,</p>
<p>and someone knocks on the door,</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t even think to answer it.</p>
<p>Like if I had an apple here, maybe I&rsquo;d eat it,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d cut it, whatever.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not gonna, it just doesn&rsquo;t enter my head</p>
<p>to smash into my face.</p>
<p>The thought of answering the door, if it&rsquo;s not my house,</p>
<p>it would never enter my head.</p>
<p>Would it enter your head?</p>
<p>No, but why?</p>
<p>But he&rsquo;s an American, so someone&rsquo;s at the door.</p>
<p>He goes and opens it, even though it&rsquo;s not his house.</p>
<p>I would never do that.</p>
<p>I would never think to do that.</p>
<p>That is so strange that you pick some very obscure thing</p>
<p>to delineate Americans and Russians.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s obscure,</p>
<p>because I think it speaks to how we perceive strangers.</p>
<p>With Americans, everyone&rsquo;s friendly,</p>
<p>and with us, it&rsquo;s like, no, no, you have that moat,</p>
<p>and I think that percolates into many different aspects</p>
<p>of how we relate to people, and I have to undo a lot of that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re right, there&rsquo;s the relationship I formed there</p>
<p>where in Russia, we&rsquo;re very deep and close,</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s the strangers, the other,</p>
<p>that you don&rsquo;t trust by default.</p>
<p>It takes a long time to go over the moat of trust.</p>
<p>For a long time, until recently,</p>
<p>whenever I said anything to anyone,</p>
<p>my brain ran a scan that said, if this person turns on you,</p>
<p>would this, can they use this against you?</p>
<p>And I would do this with everything I said with strangers,</p>
<p>and after a while, it&rsquo;s like, you know what?</p>
<p>Maybe they will, but I&rsquo;m strong enough to take it,</p>
<p>but this is not how Americans think.</p>
<p>Or here&rsquo;s another one.</p>
<p>Let me ask you this.</p>
<p>Sorry, I&rsquo;m taking over the interview.</p>
<p>People ask about advice for work, right?</p>
<p>Like I had this, there was this party I went to,</p>
<p>and basically everyone had their own problems,</p>
<p>and everyone else gave their advice, right?</p>
<p>And someone&rsquo;s having a problem with a coworker,</p>
<p>and the advice these Tupoy Americans gave them is,</p>
<p>oh, sit down and have a talk with them.</p>
<p>And to me, this is like the last case, last resort.</p>
<p>Like first, you have to see what you can</p>
<p>without showing your hand, showing your vulnerability,</p>
<p>only when everything hasn&rsquo;t worked out,</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re like, all right, let me sit down with you</p>
<p>and try to have it out with you, probably.</p>
<p>But for them, the first thing is like, sit down and be like,</p>
<p>oh, you&rsquo;re causing me problems, blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p>So I perceive that right away as a threat,</p>
<p>that this person sees an antagonism between us,</p>
<p>and also as a weakness that I&rsquo;m getting to them.</p>
<p>So my reaction isn&rsquo;t how do I make it better?</p>
<p>My reaction is to reinforce my position</p>
<p>and see what I can to marginalize them, usually.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t worked in a corporate setting in a long time.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not, I don&rsquo;t approach it the way an American would.</p>
<p>Like, I&rsquo;m glad you came and talked to me.</p>
<p>Now I probably would, because it&rsquo;s gonna be a friend.</p>
<p>So you attribute that to the Russian upbringing,</p>
<p>as opposed to you have deep psychological issues.</p>
<p>I think those are synonymous, don&rsquo;t you?</p>
<p>Wait, would you think differently, maybe a few years ago?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, I think you lost me at the,</p>
<p>because you kind of said that,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re kind of implying you have a deep distrust</p>
<p>of the world, like the world is.</p>
<p>I think the default setting would be distrust, yeah.</p>
<p>But I would put it differently,</p>
<p>is I almost ignore the rest of the world,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even acknowledge it, I just savor,</p>
<p>I save my love and trust for the small circle of people.</p>
<p>I agree, but when that person is being confrontational,</p>
<p>or as they perceive it, as being open,</p>
<p>now there&rsquo;s a situation, how would you handle that?</p>
<p>Like a cold wind blows, you just kind of like.</p>
<p>Yeah, but it&rsquo;s not like this is an opportunity</p>
<p>for us to work out our differences, it&rsquo;s a cold wind.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a hug, that&rsquo;s my point.</p>
<p>Americans think it&rsquo;s a hug, a cold wind.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re so suspicious, what it really is, is a cold wind.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so humane, it&rsquo;s not something to be scared of,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a cold wind, it&rsquo;s a good person.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not, this is great, but it&rsquo;s not a source of,</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;m not suspicious of, like I&rsquo;m not anxious,</p>
<p>I would say, or like living in fear</p>
<p>of the rest of the world, I&rsquo;m more.</p>
<p>Oh, I agree, but you&rsquo;re not receptive to that person.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all I&rsquo;m saying, and they are.</p>
<p>Got it, so speaking of which, let&rsquo;s talk about love.</p>
<p>Which requires to be receptive of the world, of strangers.</p>
<p>How do we put more love out there in the world,</p>
<p>especially on the internet?</p>
<p>One mechanism I have found to increase love,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s a word that has many meanings</p>
<p>and is used in a very intense sense</p>
<p>and is used in a very loose sense.</p>
<p>Can you try to define love?</p>
<p>Sure, love is a strong sense of attraction</p>
<p>toward another person, entity, or place</p>
<p>that causes one to tend to react</p>
<p>in a disproportionately positive manner.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s off the top of my head.</p>
<p>Disproportionately.</p>
<p>Yes, so for example, if you.</p>
<p>Why not proportionately?</p>
<p>Because if someone&rsquo;s about to, who you love,</p>
<p>is about to get harmed, you&rsquo;re moving heaven and earth</p>
<p>to make sure, or like a book you love.</p>
<p>I love this book, like you&rsquo;re going through the fire</p>
<p>to try to save it, whereas if it&rsquo;s a book you really like,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, oh, I&rsquo;ll get another one.</p>
<p>And a book&rsquo;s kind of a loose example, but.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re going with the love that&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re saving for just a few people,</p>
<p>almost like romantical, like love for a close family.</p>
<p>But what about just love to even the broader,</p>
<p>like the kind of love you can put out</p>
<p>to people on the internet, which is like just kindness.</p>
<p>Sure, I would say in that case,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s important to make them feel seen and validated.</p>
<p>And I try to do this when people who I have come to know</p>
<p>on the internet, and there&rsquo;s a lot,</p>
<p>I try to do that as much as possible</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s valid</p>
<p>how on social media, and I do this a lot myself,</p>
<p>but not towards everyone,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just there to be aggressive and antagonistic.</p>
<p>You should be antagonistic towards bad people,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s fine, but at the same time,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s lots of great people.</p>
<p>And especially with my audience,</p>
<p>and I would bet disproportionately with yours,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s lots of people who are,</p>
<p>because of their psychology and intelligence,</p>
<p>are going to be much more isolated socially than they should.</p>
<p>And if I, and I&rsquo;ve heard from many of them,</p>
<p>and if I&rsquo;m the person who makes them feel,</p>
<p>oh, I&rsquo;m not crazy, it&rsquo;s everyone else around me</p>
<p>who is just basic, the fact that I can be that person,</p>
<p>which I didn&rsquo;t have at their age,</p>
<p>to me is incredibly reaffirming.</p>
<p>You mean that source of love?</p>
<p>But I mean love in the sense of like,</p>
<p>you know, you care about this person</p>
<p>and you want good things for them,</p>
<p>not in a kind of romantic way.</p>
<p>But I mean, you&rsquo;re using it in a broad sense now.</p>
<p>Yeah, but you&rsquo;re also a person who kind of,</p>
<p>I mean, attacks the power structures in the world</p>
<p>by mocking them effectively.</p>
<p>And love, I would say, requires you to be</p>
<p>non witty and simple and fragile,</p>
<p>which I see it as like the opposite of what trolls do.</p>
<p>Trolls are, if there is someone coming after what I love,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s two mechanisms, right, at least two.</p>
<p>I go up and I&rsquo;m fighting them,</p>
<p>and in which case you are getting hurt in a knife fight,</p>
<p>even if you win the knife fight,</p>
<p>or if you disarm them and you preclude</p>
<p>the possibility of a fight and you drive them off</p>
<p>or render them powerless,</p>
<p>you keep your person intact as yourself</p>
<p>and you also protect your values.</p>
<p>So how do you render them powerless?</p>
<p>As you just said, by mocking them.</p>
<p>One of the most effective mechanisms for those in power,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re much closer to Brave New World than 1984.</p>
<p>The people who are dominant and in power</p>
<p>aren&rsquo;t there because of the threat of the gulag or prison.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re there because of social pressures.</p>
<p>Look at the masks.</p>
<p>I was on the subway not that long ago in New York City.</p>
<p>No one cared who I was until I put off the mask.</p>
<p>I was in the subway that long in New York City.</p>
<p>And I put this on my Instagram.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve told this story before.</p>
<p>There was an Asian dude in his early 30s.</p>
<p>He was like in Western clothes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like he had a rickshaw or something.</p>
<p>An older man in his 50s stood up over him on the subway,</p>
<p>screamed at him, said, go back where you came from.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re disgusting.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna get sick.</p>
<p>If you think this guy is a vector of disease,</p>
<p>which is your prerogative, why are you coming close to him?</p>
<p>Why are you getting in his face?</p>
<p>And what?</p>
<p>Sorry, so it was because he was Asian?</p>
<p>It was both.</p>
<p>It was the not having a mask gave him the permission</p>
<p>to act like a despicable, aggressive person toward him.</p>
<p>And the point being, a lot of these mechanisms</p>
<p>for social control are outsourced to low quality people</p>
<p>because this is their one chance</p>
<p>to assert dominance and status over somebody else.</p>
<p>So the best way to diffuse that</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t with weaponry or fighting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s through mockery because all of a sudden,</p>
<p>their claims to authority are effectively destroyed.</p>
<p>So let me push back on that.</p>
<p>What about fighting that with love,</p>
<p>with patience and kindness towards them?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think kindness is,</p>
<p>I think that would be a mismatch and inappropriate.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s Superman, there&rsquo;s Batman, okay?</p>
<p>And Superman&rsquo;s job is to help the good people</p>
<p>and Batman&rsquo;s job is to hurt the bad people.</p>
<p>And I will always be on the Batman side</p>
<p>than the Superman side.</p>
<p>Both work silly tight costumes.</p>
<p>One has pointy ears.</p>
<p>Both are ridiculous, so let&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>One&rsquo;s a billionaire who gets, he&rsquo;s swimming in trim.</p>
<p>Which one is a billionaire? Batman.</p>
<p>Okay, I&rsquo;m undereducated on the superhero movies,</p>
<p>I apologize.</p>
<p>Okay, but you&rsquo;re just saying your predisposition</p>
<p>is to be on the Batman side,</p>
<p>is to fighting the bad guys.</p>
<p>Yeah, and it&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m good at.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re good at.</p>
<p>But just to play devil&rsquo;s advocate,</p>
<p>or actually, in this case, I am the devil</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s what I usually do.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m the devil, you&rsquo;re the angel&rsquo;s advocate.</p>
<p>Exactly, to be the angel advocate, yeah.</p>
<p>Is like, I feel like mockery</p>
<p>is a path towards escalation of conflict.</p>
<p>Yes, in many ways, yes.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re not, I mean,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of like guerrilla warfare.</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;re not going to win.</p>
<p>I am winning, we&rsquo;re all winning.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re winning on a daily.</p>
<p>This is my next book, we&rsquo;re winning.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve won before, I&rsquo;m not joking.</p>
<p>The topic of the next book.</p>
<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s the white pill.</p>
<p>The white pill.</p>
<p>Is that we&rsquo;re gonna, we are winning.</p>
<p>The most horrible people are being rendered</p>
<p>into laughing stocks on a daily basis on social media.</p>
<p>This is a glorious thing.</p>
<p>This is good, I so disagree with you.</p>
<p>I disagree with you because there&rsquo;s side effects</p>
<p>that are very destructive.</p>
<p>It feels like you&rsquo;re winning,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re completely destroying the possibility</p>
<p>of having like a cohesive society.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s called oncology.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s that mean?</p>
<p>Curing cancer.</p>
<p>No, I, yeah.</p>
<p>Your concept of a cohesive society is, in fact,</p>
<p>a society based on oppression</p>
<p>and not allowing individuals to live their personal freedom.</p>
<p>Oh, so you&rsquo;re a utopian view of the world.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re the utopian.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re saying cohesive society.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m saying I don&rsquo;t need that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m saying there&rsquo;s gonna be conflict.</p>
<p>Right, there&rsquo;s gonna be conflict.</p>
<p>You and I are disagreeing right now.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not cohesive.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t mean we like each other less.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t mean we respect each other less.</p>
<p>Cohesive doesn&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s just a euphemism</p>
<p>for like everyone submitting to what I want.</p>
<p>No, I mean, cohesive could be that.</p>
<p>It could be like enforced with violence,</p>
<p>all that kind of stuff,</p>
<p>sort of the libertarian view of the world,</p>
<p>but it could just be being respectful</p>
<p>and kind of each other and kind towards each other</p>
<p>and loving towards each other.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s what I mean by cohesive.</p>
<p>So when people say free, it&rsquo;s funny.</p>
<p>Like freedom is a funny thing</p>
<p>because freedom could be painful to a lot of people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all matters how you define it,</p>
<p>how you implement it, how it actually looks like.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just saying it feels like the mockery</p>
<p>of the powerful leads to further and further divisions.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s turning life into a game</p>
<p>to where it&rsquo;s always you&rsquo;re creating</p>
<p>these different little tribes and groups</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re constantly fighting the groups</p>
<p>that become a little bit more powerful</p>
<p>by undercutting them through guerrilla warfare kind of thing.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what the internet becomes</p>
<p>is everyone&rsquo;s just mocking each other</p>
<p>and then certain groups become more and more powerful</p>
<p>and then they start fighting each other</p>
<p>and they form groups of ideologies</p>
<p>and they start fighting each other in the internet</p>
<p>where the result is it doesn&rsquo;t feel like</p>
<p>the common humanities highlighted.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t feel like that&rsquo;s a path of progress.</p>
<p>Now, like when I say cohesive,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t mean like everybody has to be enforcing equality,</p>
<p>all those kinds of ideas.</p>
<p>I just mean like not being so divisive.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s going back to the original question of like,</p>
<p>how do we put more love out in the world than the internet?</p>
<p>I want divisiveness.</p>
<p>Oh, you see, you think divisiveness is that?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the goal.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s very interesting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the goal.</p>
<p>So you started this conversation</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re talking about you have love</p>
<p>for that small group.</p>
<p>I think we both would agree to have a bigger group</p>
<p>would be better,</p>
<p>especially if that love comes from a sincere place.</p>
<p>I think our country,</p>
<p>I wrote an article about this four years ago</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s time to disunite the states and to secede.</p>
<p>This country has been held together</p>
<p>with at least two separate cultures</p>
<p>with dumb text and string for over 20 years.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an enormous amount of contempt</p>
<p>from one group toward another.</p>
<p>This contempt comes from a sincere place.</p>
<p>They do not share each other&rsquo;s values.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s absolutely no reason,</p>
<p>just like any unhealthy relationship</p>
<p>where you can&rsquo;t say, you know what?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not working out.</p>
<p>I want to go my own way and live my happiness.</p>
<p>And I genuinely want you to go your way,</p>
<p>live your happiness.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m wrong, prove me wrong.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll learn from you and take lessons and vice versa.</p>
<p>But the fact that we all have to be</p>
<p>in the same house together is not coherent.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not love.</p>
<p>That is the path towards friction and tension and conflict.</p>
<p>Do you think there&rsquo;s concrete groups?</p>
<p>Like is it as simple as the two groups of blue and red?</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s also very fluid</p>
<p>because you and I are allied as Jewish people,</p>
<p>as Russians, as males, as podcasters.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re an academic, I&rsquo;m not.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re different, but we each are a Venn diagram,</p>
<p>even within ourselves.</p>
<p>And I can talk to you about politics</p>
<p>and then we can talk about Russia stuff.</p>
<p>And then you could talk about your work,</p>
<p>which I don&rsquo;t know anything about.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;d be where you&rsquo;re way up here and a way down here.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s lots, every relationship</p>
<p>with just between individuals, it&rsquo;s very dynamic.</p>
<p>So how do we succeed?</p>
<p>Like how do we form individual states</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s a little bit more cohesion?</p>
<p>Sure, and voluntary cohesion.</p>
<p>So the first step is to eliminate</p>
<p>and the concept of political authority as legitimate</p>
<p>and to denigrate and humiliate those</p>
<p>who would put themselves in a position</p>
<p>in which they are there to tell you how to live your life</p>
<p>from any semblance of validity.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s starting to happen.</p>
<p>If you look at what they had with the lockdowns,</p>
<p>Cuomo and de Blasio, New York,</p>
<p>I was tired a couple of weeks ago.</p>
<p>And I said to my friend, oh, just click, maybe I have COVID.</p>
<p>And he goes, it&rsquo;s not possible, like what do you mean?</p>
<p>And he goes, we haven&rsquo;t had any deaths in like two months.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s only like 100 cases a day for like two months.</p>
<p>And I go, you&rsquo;re exaggerating</p>
<p>because everything was still closed.</p>
<p>And I looked at the numbers and he wasn&rsquo;t exaggerating.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s no greater American dream to me</p>
<p>than an immigrant family comes to the states,</p>
<p>forms their own little business.</p>
<p>Maybe mom&rsquo;s a good cook, it&rsquo;s a restaurant,</p>
<p>dry cleaner, fruit stand.</p>
<p>And those people aren&rsquo;t gonna have a lot of money.</p>
<p>Those are the first ones who lost their companies</p>
<p>because of these lockdowns.</p>
<p>Cuomo, who&rsquo;s the governor of New York,</p>
<p>opened up the gyms, he said, you&rsquo;re clear to open up.</p>
<p>De Blasio said, and we don&rsquo;t have enough inspectors,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna have to wait another couple of weeks.</p>
<p>To regard that as anything other than literally criminal</p>
<p>is something that I am having a hard and harder time</p>
<p>wrapping my head around.</p>
<p>You said, I mean, that&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m deeply worried about as well,</p>
<p>which is like thousands, it&rsquo;s actually millions</p>
<p>of dreams being crushed, that American dream</p>
<p>of starting a business, of running a business.</p>
<p>What about all the young people who you and I</p>
<p>have in our audiences who are socially isolated at best,</p>
<p>and now they can&rsquo;t leave their homes?</p>
<p>Isolation and ostracism are things</p>
<p>that are very well studied in psychology.</p>
<p>These have extreme consequences.</p>
<p>I read a book called Ostracism, and this wasn&rsquo;t scientific,</p>
<p>but basically the author was a psychiatrist,</p>
<p>psychologist, whatever, and he had one of his colleagues,</p>
<p>they did an experiment, let&rsquo;s for a week,</p>
<p>you ostracize me completely.</p>
<p>We know it&rsquo;s an, and he goes, even knowing</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the experiment, the fact that he wouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>make eye contact with me and the fact that he ignored me</p>
<p>had an extreme emotional impact on me,</p>
<p>knowing full well this is purely for experimental purposes.</p>
<p>Now you multiply that by all these, the suicide,</p>
<p>the number of kids who were thinking about suicide</p>
<p>was through the roof during all this.</p>
<p>And my point is, until these people,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna, I would predict like 2024,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s where we&rsquo;re gonna have to start having conversations</p>
<p>about what personal consequences have to be done</p>
<p>for these people, because until then,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna do the same thing.</p>
<p>So you think there&rsquo;s going to be society wide consequences</p>
<p>of this that we&rsquo;re gonna see, like ripple effects,</p>
<p>because of the social isolation?</p>
<p>I know, I mean, we also need to talk about consequences</p>
<p>for Cuomo and de Blasio, because if politicians</p>
<p>respond to incentives, and the incentives are there</p>
<p>for them to be extremely conservative,</p>
<p>because if you have to choose, as Cuomo said</p>
<p>in a press conference, between a thousand people dying</p>
<p>and a thousand people losing their business,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not a hard choice, and he&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>But at a certain point, it&rsquo;s like, all right,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re losing both, you&rsquo;re making these decisions</p>
<p>and not having consequences for it,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re gonna do it again the next time,</p>
<p>so we need to make sure you&rsquo;re a little scared.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know what that would mean.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re laying this problem, this incompetence.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s incompetence,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s very competent.</p>
<p>I think their job is to be able, yes.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re laying it not at the hands of the individuals,</p>
<p>but the structure of government.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s both, yes.</p>
<p>How would we deal with it better</p>
<p>without centralized control?</p>
<p>Well, we didn&rsquo;t really have centralized control,</p>
<p>because every country and every state</p>
<p>handled it in a different mechanism.</p>
<p>But a city has centralized control, right?</p>
<p>No, that&rsquo;s not true.</p>
<p>So Cuomo and de Blasio, they had a lot of disagreements</p>
<p>over this over the months, and this was actually</p>
<p>a source of great interest and tension.</p>
<p>De Blasio wanted, at one point, was talking about</p>
<p>quarantining people in their homes.</p>
<p>Cuomo was like, you&rsquo;re crazy.</p>
<p>Same thing with the schools, same thing with the gyms,</p>
<p>and there were other such examples.</p>
<p>But the point being, this was an emergency.</p>
<p>World War I, I talked about this on Tim Poole&rsquo;s show,</p>
<p>was very dangerous, because it gave a lot of evil people</p>
<p>some very useful information about what the country</p>
<p>put up with and what they can get away with under wartime.</p>
<p>And this set the model for things like the New Deal</p>
<p>and the other things of that nature.</p>
<p>It is undeniable, you&rsquo;re a scientist,</p>
<p>so you understand this perfectly well,</p>
<p>that this lockdown gave some very nefarious people</p>
<p>some very valid data about how much people</p>
<p>were put up with under pressures from the state.</p>
<p>So fundamentally, what is the problem with the state?</p>
<p>Its existence.</p>
<p>Okay, well, but to play angel&rsquo;s advocate again,</p>
<p>angel&rsquo;s advocate again, you know,</p>
<p>government is the people.</p>
<p>Come on, do you really think this?</p>
<p>As best I think as possible to have representation.</p>
<p>Can you imagine if you have an attorney?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like, oh, you can&rsquo;t have the attorney you want.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna have this guy who you absolutely hate</p>
<p>who you share no values with, why?</p>
<p>Because he drives, I mean, leaders, political leaders,</p>
<p>and political representation drive the discourse.</p>
<p>Like the majority of people voted for him or whatever,</p>
<p>however you define that.</p>
<p>And now we get to have a discussion,</p>
<p>well, was this the right choice?</p>
<p>And then we get to make that choice again</p>
<p>in four years and so on.</p>
<p>First of all, the fact that I have to be under the thumb</p>
<p>of somebody for four years makes no sense.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no other relationship that&rsquo;s like this,</p>
<p>including a marriage.</p>
<p>You can leave any other relationship at any time,</p>
<p>number one.</p>
<p>Number two is.</p>
<p>You could always impeach.</p>
<p>Well, they did that.</p>
<p>Part of it I&rsquo;m just saying that the mechanisms</p>
<p>are flawed in many ways, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, right, and so that&rsquo;s number one.</p>
<p>Number two is it doesn&rsquo;t make sense</p>
<p>that if I don&rsquo;t want someone to represent me</p>
<p>that because that person is popular</p>
<p>that they are now in a position to.</p>
<p>So having representation and having citizenship</p>
<p>based on geography is a prelandline technology</p>
<p>in a post cell phone world.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no reason why I have to,</p>
<p>just because we&rsquo;re physically in between two oceans,</p>
<p>we all have to be represented by the same people,</p>
<p>whereas I can very easily have my security</p>
<p>be under someone and switch it as easily</p>
<p>as cell phone providers.</p>
<p>So, okay, but it doesn&rsquo;t have to be geographical.</p>
<p>It can be ideas.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>I mean, this country represents a certain set of ideas.</p>
<p>Yes, it does.</p>
<p>It started out geographically.</p>
<p>It still is geographic.</p>
<p>It was both.</p>
<p>It started off as ideas as well.</p>
<p>But like, it was intricately.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s the way humans are.</p>
<p>I mean, there was no internet.</p>
<p>So it was, you were geographically in the same location</p>
<p>and you signed a bunch of documents</p>
<p>and then you kind of debated</p>
<p>and you wrote a bunch of stuff</p>
<p>and then you agreed on it.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>You understand that no one signed these documents</p>
<p>and no one agreed to it.</p>
<p>As Lysander Spooner pointed out over 150 years ago,</p>
<p>the constitution or the social contract, if anything,</p>
<p>is only binding to the signatories.</p>
<p>And even then they&rsquo;re all long dead.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s this fallacy that somehow,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m in a physical place,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve agreed, even though I&rsquo;m screaming through your face</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t agree,</p>
<p>to be subordinate to some imaginary, invisible monster</p>
<p>that was created 250 years ago.</p>
<p>And this idea of like, if you don&rsquo;t like it,</p>
<p>you have to move.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not what freedom means.</p>
<p>Freedom means I do what I want, not what you want.</p>
<p>So if you don&rsquo;t like it, you move.</p>
<p>Okay, just to put some, I don&rsquo;t like words and terms.</p>
<p>One, one, one, zero, one, one, one, zero, one.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>Is that what your language is?</p>
<p>It is, I&rsquo;m translating it all in real time.</p>
<p>But would you call the kind of ideas</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re advocating for</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re talking about anarchy?</p>
<p>Yes, anarchism, yes.</p>
<p>Okay, so let&rsquo;s get into it.</p>
<p>Can you try to paint the utopia</p>
<p>that an anarchist worldview dreams about?</p>
<p>The only people who describe anarchism as utopia</p>
<p>are its critics.</p>
<p>If I told you right now,</p>
<p>and I wish I could say this factually,</p>
<p>that I have a cure for cancer,</p>
<p>that would not make us a utopia.</p>
<p>That would still probably be expensive.</p>
<p>We would still have many other diseases.</p>
<p>However, we would be fundamentally healthier,</p>
<p>happier and better off, all of us.</p>
<p>Than democracy.</p>
<p>So, sorry, I jumped back from the cancer.</p>
<p>No, than democracy or government.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s only curing one major,</p>
<p>major life threatening problem,</p>
<p>but in no sense is it a utopia.</p>
<p>So what, can we try to answer this question,</p>
<p>same question many times,</p>
<p>which is what exactly is the problem with democracy?</p>
<p>The problem with democracy is that those who need leaders</p>
<p>are not qualified to choose them.</p>
<p>Those who need leaders are not qualified to choose them.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the central problem with democracy.</p>
<p>Not all of us need leaders.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So, what does it mean to need a leader?</p>
<p>Are you saying like people who are actually</p>
<p>like free thinkers don&rsquo;t need leaders kind of thing?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good way of working.</p>
<p>But like, you don&rsquo;t, okay.</p>
<p>So do you acknowledge that there&rsquo;s some value</p>
<p>in authority in different subjects?</p>
<p>So what that means is,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t mean authority, somebody who&rsquo;s in control of you,</p>
<p>but.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re doing the definition switch.</p>
<p>Because.</p>
<p>I am, I am.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re right, you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s unfair.</p>
<p>Okay, that was bad.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s what they do.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s their trick.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And this is one of the useful things,</p>
<p>by the way, that&rsquo;s this total sidebar.</p>
<p>If people ask me for advice,</p>
<p>I always tell them if you&rsquo;re gonna raise your kids,</p>
<p>raise them bilingual.</p>
<p>Because I was trilingual by the time I was six</p>
<p>and that teaches you to think in concepts.</p>
<p>Whereas if you only know one language,</p>
<p>you fall for things like this,</p>
<p>because using authority in the sense of a policeman</p>
<p>and someone has authority in physics,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the same word.</p>
<p>Conceptually, they&rsquo;re extremely different.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re only thinking in one language,</p>
<p>your brain is going to equate the two.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a trap that people</p>
<p>who only speak one language have.</p>
<p>For sure.</p>
<p>But even if you know multiple languages,</p>
<p>you can still use the trick of using</p>
<p>the worst of your convenience.</p>
<p>Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>To manipulate the conversation.</p>
<p>But you weren&rsquo;t trying to do that,</p>
<p>but you fell into that.</p>
<p>I accidentally did it.</p>
<p>Yeah, you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>We all tend to do that if you only speak one language</p>
<p>and think in one language.</p>
<p>But if, I guess let me rephrase it.</p>
<p>Are you against, do you acknowledge the value</p>
<p>of offloading your own effort</p>
<p>about a particular thing to somebody else?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Like an accountant, a lawyer, a doctor,</p>
<p>absolute, a chef, infinite.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t that ultimately what a democracy is?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Broadly defined, like you&rsquo;re basically electing</p>
<p>a bunch of authorities.</p>
<p>Using the word you in two senses.</p>
<p>Using the word you meaning me as an individual,</p>
<p>not using you as a mass.</p>
<p>Yeah, as a mass, not you as an individual.</p>
<p>Right, so I would absolutely want someone</p>
<p>to provide for my security.</p>
<p>I would absolutely want someone to negotiate with me</p>
<p>for foreign power or something like that.</p>
<p>That does not mean it has to be predicated</p>
<p>and what lots of other people who I do not know</p>
<p>and if I do know them, probably would not respect,</p>
<p>think about.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s of no moral relevance to me.</p>
<p>Nor I to them.</p>
<p>So do you think this kind of,</p>
<p>there could be a bunch of humans that behave</p>
<p>kind of like ants in a distributed way.</p>
<p>There could be an emergent behavior in them</p>
<p>that results in a stable society.</p>
<p>Like isn&rsquo;t that the hope with anarchy</p>
<p>is like without an overarching.</p>
<p>But ants, I mean ants are the worst example here</p>
<p>because ants have a very firm authority.</p>
<p>The queen?</p>
<p>Yeah, and they&rsquo;re all drones.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all clones of each other.</p>
<p>Yeah, but so if you forget the queen,</p>
<p>their behavior, they&rsquo;re all,</p>
<p>well from your perspective,</p>
<p>from your human intelligent perspective,</p>
<p>but from their perspective,</p>
<p>they probably see each other as a bunch of individuals.</p>
<p>No they don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Ants are very big on altruism</p>
<p>in the sense of self sacrifice.</p>
<p>They do not think the individual matters.</p>
<p>They routinely kill themselves</p>
<p>for the sake of the hive in the community.</p>
<p>But they, see that&rsquo;s from the outside perspective,</p>
<p>from the individual perspective of the individual,</p>
<p>they probably, they don&rsquo;t see it as altruism.</p>
<p>Right, but they view and they&rsquo;re right</p>
<p>because the ants life is very ephemeral and cheap,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s more important to continue this mass population</p>
<p>that one individual ant live.</p>
<p>Like bees are another even better example.</p>
<p>The honeybee, when they sting,</p>
<p>they only sting once and they die.</p>
<p>And they do it gladly because it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>okay, this community is much more important than me</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>Yeah, okay, so fine, let&rsquo;s forget.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m being pedantic, but it&rsquo;s important, I think.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not just being pedantic</p>
<p>for the sake of being pedantic.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s something beautiful that I won&rsquo;t argue about</p>
<p>because I do, there&rsquo;s an interesting point there</p>
<p>about individualism of ants.</p>
<p>I do think they&rsquo;re more individual.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s give your view of ants that they&rsquo;re communists.</p>
<p>Okay, let&rsquo;s go with the communist view of ants.</p>
<p>Okay, yeah.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re still a beautiful emergent thing,</p>
<p>which is like they can function as a society</p>
<p>and without, I would say, centralized control.</p>
<p>Yeah, I agree with you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s another argument.</p>
<p>So is that the hope for anarchy?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like you just throw a bunch of people</p>
<p>that voluntarily wanna be in the same place</p>
<p>under the same set of ideas</p>
<p>and they kind of, like the doctors emerge,</p>
<p>the police officers emerge,</p>
<p>the different necessary structures</p>
<p>of a functional society emerge.</p>
<p>Do you know what the most beautiful example of anarchism is</p>
<p>that is just beyond beautiful</p>
<p>when you stop to think about it?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll see Twitter.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not being tongue in cheek.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Language.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s infinite languages.</p>
<p>Language, the things that language can be used for</p>
<p>are bring tears to people&rsquo;s eyes quite literally.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also used for basic things.</p>
<p>No one is forcing us.</p>
<p>We speak two languages each at least.</p>
<p>No one&rsquo;s forcing us to use English.</p>
<p>No one&rsquo;s forcing us to use this dialect of English.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a way, and despite there being</p>
<p>so many different languages, lingua franca emerge,</p>
<p>the language that everyone is, Latin.</p>
<p>Even in North Korea, they refer to the fish</p>
<p>and the different animals by the Latin scientific note.</p>
<p>No one decided this.</p>
<p>Sure, there&rsquo;s an organization</p>
<p>that sets a binomial nomenclature,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s no gun to anyone&rsquo;s head</p>
<p>referring to a sea moth as a Pegasus species.</p>
<p>And when you think about how amazing language is,</p>
<p>and in some other context would say like,</p>
<p>well, you need to have a world government</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re deciding which is the verbs</p>
<p>and you have to have an official definition</p>
<p>and an official dictionary.</p>
<p>And none of that&rsquo;s happened.</p>
<p>And I think anyone, even if they don&rsquo;t agree</p>
<p>with my politics or my worldview,</p>
<p>cannot deny that the creation of language</p>
<p>is one of humanity&rsquo;s most miraculous,</p>
<p>beautiful achievements.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>So there you go.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s one system where a kind of anarchy</p>
<p>can result in beauty, stability,</p>
<p>like sufficient stability,</p>
<p>and yet, flexibility to adjust it and so on.</p>
<p>And the internet helps it.</p>
<p>You get something like Urban Dictionary,</p>
<p>which starts creating absurd, both humor and wit.</p>
<p>But also language and syntax and jargon,</p>
<p>immediately you size people up.</p>
<p>If you say vertebral, I know you&rsquo;re a doctor,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s how they pronounce it, the spinal column.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure in your field, there&rsquo;s certain jargon</p>
<p>and right away you can know if this person&rsquo;s one of us</p>
<p>or not.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s infinite.</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t need to tell you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s emojis too.</p>
<p>Yes, there&rsquo;s so much there to study with language.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>But do you think this applies to human life?</p>
<p>The meat space, the physical space?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So that kind of beauty can emerge</p>
<p>without writing stuff on paper, without laws.</p>
<p>You could have rules.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need, they don&rsquo;t have to be laws.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>Enforced by violence.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s what, what&rsquo;s a law?</p>
<p>A law is something that is unchosen.</p>
<p>A rule is something.</p>
<p>If I go to my pool, you know,</p>
<p>I sign up to be a member of pool,</p>
<p>on the wall there&rsquo;s certain things.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, you know, certain number of people in the pool.</p>
<p>No peeing in here.</p>
<p>Good luck enforcing that one.</p>
<p>And so on and so forth.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s the problem.</p>
<p>Aren&rsquo;t you afraid that people are gonna pee in the pool?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not as my big concern as mass incarceration,</p>
<p>as the fact that the police can steal more money</p>
<p>than burglars can.</p>
<p>The fact that innocent people can be killed</p>
<p>with no consequences.</p>
<p>The fact that war can be waged</p>
<p>and with no consequences for those who waged it.</p>
<p>The fact that so many men and women are being murdered</p>
<p>overseas and here,</p>
<p>and the people who are guiding these are regarded as heroic.</p>
<p>So you think there might,</p>
<p>that in an anarchist system,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a possibility of having less wars</p>
<p>and less, what would you say, corruption</p>
<p>and less abuse of power?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk, yes.</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s talk about corruption</p>
<p>because, and I made this point on Rogan,</p>
<p>you and I, again, the Russian background,</p>
<p>we realize that when it comes to corruption,</p>
<p>American is very naive.</p>
<p>Corruption they think is, oh, I got my brother a job</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s getting money on the table.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not, when we&rsquo;re talking about like state corruption,</p>
<p>things that are done in totalitarian states</p>
<p>and even to some extent in America,</p>
<p>like Jeffrey Epstein, Jillian Maxwell,</p>
<p>things that Stalin did, things that Hitler did.</p>
<p>When the CIA was torturing people at Gitmo,</p>
<p>they had to borrow KGB manuals</p>
<p>because they didn&rsquo;t know how to torture correctly</p>
<p>because they never thought of these things.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very hard for us to get into the mindset</p>
<p>of someone who&rsquo;s like a child predator,</p>
<p>someone who, let me give you an example</p>
<p>from my forthcoming book.</p>
<p>There was a guy who was the head of Ukraine in the 30s,</p>
<p>I forget his name.</p>
<p>Now these old Soviets, they were tough.</p>
<p>I mean, they pride, Stalin means steel.</p>
<p>They pride themselves and their cruelty</p>
<p>and how strong they were.</p>
<p>And this was the purge.</p>
<p>Stalin is trying to, killing lots of people left and right</p>
<p>and his henchman, Beria had the quote,</p>
<p>find me the man and I&rsquo;ll find you the crime.</p>
<p>They would accuse someone and they would torture him</p>
<p>until he talked and confessed</p>
<p>and then he had to turn people in.</p>
<p>And they took this guy in like beginning of the year,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s 36, 38, he was head of Ukraine.</p>
<p>By May, he&rsquo;s arrested.</p>
<p>And they take him to the Ljubljanka, the basement</p>
<p>in the red square where they&rsquo;re torturing people.</p>
<p>And they did the works on him.</p>
<p>And he was a good Soviet and he stood up.</p>
<p>Who knows what they did to him?</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t talk.</p>
<p>So they said, okay, one moment.</p>
<p>They brought his teenage daughter in,</p>
<p>raped her in front of him, he talked.</p>
<p>So when we talk about corruption,</p>
<p>we would never in a million years think of this.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not how our minds work.</p>
<p>So when you&rsquo;re talking about states</p>
<p>and people where you don&rsquo;t have ease of exit,</p>
<p>where you are forced to be under the auspices</p>
<p>of an organization creating a monopoly,</p>
<p>that leads to in extreme cases,</p>
<p>but in not as extreme cases, really nefarious outcomes.</p>
<p>Whereas if you have the option to leave</p>
<p>as a client or customer,</p>
<p>that would have a strongly limiting effect</p>
<p>on how a business and what it can get away with.</p>
<p>But don&rsquo;t you think maybe,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know who the right example is,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s Stalin,</p>
<p>I think Hitler might be the better example of,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t you think, or Jeffrey Epstein perhaps,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t you think people who are evil</p>
<p>will find ways to manipulate human nature</p>
<p>to attain power, no matter the system?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And like the corollary question is,</p>
<p>do you think those people can get more power</p>
<p>in a democracy, when there&rsquo;s a government already in place?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easily they get more power, more dangerous</p>
<p>to have a government in place.</p>
<p>First of all, sociopaths don&rsquo;t know for their charm</p>
<p>and for their warmth.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the two situations.</p>
<p>In a free society, I&rsquo;m a sociopath, I&rsquo;m an evil person,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m the head of Macy&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>In a state society, I&rsquo;m an evil person, I&rsquo;m a sociopath,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m the head of the US government.</p>
<p>Which of these are you more concerned with?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like night and day.</p>
<p>So you would have far more decentralized military,</p>
<p>you would have far more decentralized security forces,</p>
<p>and they would be much more subject</p>
<p>to feedback from the market.</p>
<p>If you have an issue with Macy&rsquo;s</p>
<p>or any store with a sweater, look at that transaction.</p>
<p>If you have an issue with the state,</p>
<p>hiring a lawyer costs more than a surgeon.</p>
<p>To even access the mechanism for dispute</p>
<p>is going to be exorbitant and price poor people</p>
<p>out of the market for conflict resolution immediately.</p>
<p>So right away, you have something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s extremely regressive.</p>
<p>And even though this is touted as some great equalizer,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s quite the opposite.</p>
<p>So in current society, there&rsquo;s deep suspicion</p>
<p>of governments and states.</p>
<p>Not really.</p>
<p>Like just your example of Macy&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>I mean, don&rsquo;t you think a Hitler could rise</p>
<p>to be at the top of a social network</p>
<p>like Twitter and Facebook?</p>
<p>Okay, let&rsquo;s suppose Hitler ran Twitter, okay?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take this thought experiment seriously.</p>
<p>Literally what could he do?</p>
<p>So the only tweets are gonna be</p>
<p>about how much the Jews suck, right?</p>
<p>Okay, fine.</p>
<p>Okay, all the cool people are leaving.</p>
<p>There could be some compelling,</p>
<p>like you said, evil people are charming.</p>
<p>There could be some compelling narratives</p>
<p>that could be with conspiracy theories, untruths,</p>
<p>that could be spread like propaganda.</p>
<p>Every criticism of anarchism is in fact a description.</p>
<p>Well, the strongest criticism of anarchism</p>
<p>are in fact descriptions of status quo.</p>
<p>Your concern is, under anarchism, propaganda would spread</p>
<p>and people would be taught the wrong ideas,</p>
<p>unlike the status quo?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not even a criticism of anarchism.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not actually criticizing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an open question of,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an open question of in which system</p>
<p>will human nature be able to thrive more</p>
<p>and in which system would the evils</p>
<p>that arise in human nature</p>
<p>would be more easily suppressible?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the open question.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a scientific experiment</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m asking only from my perspective</p>
<p>of the fact that we&rsquo;ve tried democracy</p>
<p>quite a bit recently and maybe you can correct me,</p>
<p>we haven&rsquo;t yet seriously tried anarchy on a large scale.</p>
<p>Well, we don&rsquo;t need to try to,</p>
<p>so anarchy isn&rsquo;t like a country, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like saying, well, if anarchy works,</p>
<p>how come we&rsquo;ve never had an anarchist government, right?</p>
<p>So anarchism is a relationship</p>
<p>and language is an example of this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a worldwide anarchic system.</p>
<p>You and I have an anarchist relationship.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s almost no circumstances</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;d be calling the police on each other.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m asking the same question</p>
<p>in a bunch of different directions</p>
<p>out of, born out of my curiosity,</p>
<p>is why is anarchy going to be better</p>
<p>at preventing the darker sides of human nature,</p>
<p>which presumably your criticism of government.</p>
<p>Because of decentralization.</p>
<p>So the darker side of human nature is an extreme concern.</p>
<p>Anyone who says it&rsquo;s gonna go away</p>
<p>is absurd and fallacious.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a nonstarter</p>
<p>when people say that everyone&rsquo;s gonna be good.</p>
<p>Human beings are basically animals.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re capable of great beauty and kindness.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re capable of just complete cruel</p>
<p>and what we would call inhumanity,</p>
<p>but we see it on a daily basis even today.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s interesting is the corporate press</p>
<p>won&rsquo;t even tell you the darkest aspects</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s too upsetting to people.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;ll tell you about atrocities and horrors,</p>
<p>but only to a point.</p>
<p>And then when you actually do the homework,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re like, oh, it&rsquo;s so much worse than,</p>
<p>like that thing about Stalin, right?</p>
<p>So we know in a broad sense that Stalin was a dictator.</p>
<p>We know that he killed a lot of people,</p>
<p>but it takes work to learn about the Holodomor.</p>
<p>It takes work to learn about</p>
<p>what those literal tortures were</p>
<p>and that this is the person who later,</p>
<p>FDR and Harry Truman were shaking hands with</p>
<p>and taking photos with</p>
<p>and was being sold to us as Uncle Joe.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s just like you and me.</p>
<p>So when you have a decentralized information network</p>
<p>as opposed to having three media networks,</p>
<p>it is a lot easier for information</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t fit what would be</p>
<p>the corporate America narrative to reach the populations.</p>
<p>And it would be more effective for democracy</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re in a much better position to be informed.</p>
<p>Now, you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>It also means, well, if everyone has a mic,</p>
<p>that means every crazy person and with their wacky views.</p>
<p>And at a certain point, yeah, it has to become,</p>
<p>then there&rsquo;s another level,</p>
<p>which is then the people have to be self enforcing.</p>
<p>And you see that in social media all the time</p>
<p>where someone says this, the other person jumps in.</p>
<p>You think, but isn&rsquo;t social media a good example of this?</p>
<p>So you think ultimately without centralized control,</p>
<p>you can have stability?</p>
<p>What about the mob outrage and the mob rule,</p>
<p>the power of the mobs that emerge?</p>
<p>Power of the mob is a very serious concern.</p>
<p>Gustav Le Bon wrote a book in the 1890s called The Crowd.</p>
<p>And this was one of the most important books I&rsquo;ve written</p>
<p>because it influenced both Mussolini and Hitler and Stalin</p>
<p>and they all talked about it.</p>
<p>And he made the point that under crowd psychology,</p>
<p>human lynching is another example of this.</p>
<p>None of those individuals or very few</p>
<p>would ever dream of doing these acts.</p>
<p>But when they&rsquo;re all together</p>
<p>and you lose that sense of self, you become the ant</p>
<p>and you lose that sense of individually,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re capable of doing things that like in another context,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d be like, I should kill myself, I&rsquo;m a monster.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re worried about that, but doesn&rsquo;t the mob have more</p>
<p>power under anarchy?</p>
<p>No, the mob has much less power in anarchy</p>
<p>because under anarchism, every individual</p>
<p>is fully empowered.</p>
<p>You wouldn&rsquo;t have gun restrictions.</p>
<p>You would have people creating communities</p>
<p>based on shared values.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;d be much more collegial, they&rsquo;d be much more kind,</p>
<p>as opposed to when you&rsquo;re forcing people</p>
<p>to be together in a polity</p>
<p>when they don&rsquo;t have things in common.</p>
<p>That is like having a bad roommate.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re forced to look like jails,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re forced to be locked in a room with someone,</p>
<p>even if you had first liked them,</p>
<p>after a while, you&rsquo;re going to start to hate them</p>
<p>and that leads to very nefarious consequences.</p>
<p>So as an anarchist, what do you do in a society like this?</p>
<p>Thrive.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;m doing okay.</p>
<p>No, I mean, there&rsquo;s an election coming up.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s, as you talk, You&rsquo;re Welcome</p>
<p>is one of the 15 shows that you host.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s down to one.</p>
<p>Okay, it&rsquo;s down to one.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m a big fan.</p>
<p>You talk about libertarianism a little bit.</p>
<p>I mean, is there some practical political direction</p>
<p>in terms of we as a society should go?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t mean we as a nation.</p>
<p>I mean, we as a collective of people</p>
<p>should go to make a better world</p>
<p>from an anarchist point of view.</p>
<p>Sure, I think politics is the enemy and anything.</p>
<p>How do you define politics?</p>
<p>The state, the government.</p>
<p>So anything that lessens its sway on people,</p>
<p>anything that delegitimizes it is good.</p>
<p>I wrote an article a few years ago</p>
<p>about how wonderful it is that Trump</p>
<p>is regarded as such a buffoon</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s very, very useful</p>
<p>to have a commander in chief who&rsquo;s regarded as a clown</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s gonna take a lot</p>
<p>to get him to convince your kids to go overseas</p>
<p>and start killing people and making widows and orphans,</p>
<p>as well as those kids coming home in caskets.</p>
<p>Whereas if someone is regarded with prestige</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re like, oh, we need to send your kid overseas.</p>
<p>Oh, absolutely.</p>
<p>I mean, this guy&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>So that is a very healthy thing</p>
<p>where people are skeptical of the state.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a lot of people that regard him</p>
<p>as one of the greatest leaders we&rsquo;ve ever had.</p>
<p>Yeah, Dinesh D&rsquo;Souza, he&rsquo;s another Lincoln.</p>
<p>When you talk shit about Trump</p>
<p>or talk shit about Biden,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to find a line to walk</p>
<p>where they don&rsquo;t immediately put you into</p>
<p>this person has Trump derangement syndrome</p>
<p>or they have the alternative to that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m more than happy</p>
<p>when people are preemptively dismissing me</p>
<p>because then I don&rsquo;t have to waste time engaging with them</p>
<p>because those people would be of no use to me.</p>
<p>When I was on Tim Pool recently, Tim Pool&rsquo;s show,</p>
<p>Tim Pool&rsquo;s known for his little hat.</p>
<p>I got a propeller beanie motorized</p>
<p>and it was just spinning the whole two hours.</p>
<p>I know, like a 1950s thing.</p>
<p>The point being I wore it because there&rsquo;s lots of people</p>
<p>who would say, I can&rsquo;t take seriously someone</p>
<p>who wears a hat like that.</p>
<p>And my point being, if you are the kind of person</p>
<p>who takes your cues based on someone&rsquo;s wardrobe</p>
<p>as opposed to the content of your ideas,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re of no use to me as an ally.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;d be more than happy you preemptively abort</p>
<p>rather than waste our breath trying to engage.</p>
<p>This is a very, very deep thing that you and I disagree on,</p>
<p>which is, this goes to the trolling versus the love,</p>
<p>is I believe that person instinctually dismisses you</p>
<p>on the very basic surface level.</p>
<p>But deep down, there&rsquo;s a wealth of a human being</p>
<p>that seeks the connection, seeks to understand deeply</p>
<p>to connect with other humans that we should speak to.</p>
<p>Yeah, you and I completely disagree.</p>
<p>See, you&rsquo;re saying.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m saying there&rsquo;s no mind there literally.</p>
<p>Okay, so I naturally think the majority of people</p>
<p>have the capacity to be thoughtful, intelligent,</p>
<p>and learn about ideas, ideas that they instinctually</p>
<p>based on their own current inner circle disagree with</p>
<p>and learn to understand, to empathize with the other.</p>
<p>And in the current climate,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a divisiveness that discourages that.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where I see the value of love of encouraging</p>
<p>people to strip away that surface instinctual response</p>
<p>based on the thing they&rsquo;ve been taught,</p>
<p>based on the things they listen to,</p>
<p>to actually think deeply.</p>
<p>Have you ever had gone to CVS or Duane Reade</p>
<p>and your bill, how much you owe them is $6,</p>
<p>and you give them a $10 bill in a single</p>
<p>and watch the look on their face?</p>
<p>You watch them void their bowels and panic</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;ve given them $11 on a $6 bill.</p>
<p>This is not a mind capable or interested</p>
<p>in thoughts and ideas and learning.</p>
<p>No, you&rsquo;re talking about the first moment</p>
<p>of a first moment where there&rsquo;s an opportunity to think.</p>
<p>They are desperate to avoid it.</p>
<p>No, they&rsquo;re just, it&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>And incapable of it.</p>
<p>I just, they have the same exact experiences</p>
<p>I have every single day when I know it&rsquo;s time</p>
<p>for me to go out on a run of five miles</p>
<p>or six miles or 10 miles.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m desperate to avoid it, and at the same time,</p>
<p>I know I have the capacity to do it,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m deeply fulfilled when I do do it,</p>
<p>when I do overcome that challenge.</p>
<p>You are one of the great minds of our generation.</p>
<p>You are telling me that any of these people</p>
<p>can do anything close to the work you do?</p>
<p>Not in artificial intelligence,</p>
<p>but in the ability to be compassionate</p>
<p>towards other people&rsquo;s ideas,</p>
<p>like understand them enough to be able.</p>
<p>Passion requires a certain baseline of intelligence,</p>
<p>because you have to perceive other people</p>
<p>as being different but of value.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a sophisticated mindset.</p>
<p>I think most people are capable of it.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t think so?</p>
<p>No, and nor are they interested in it.</p>
<p>But in that kind of,</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t believe they&rsquo;re capable of it,</p>
<p>how can anarchy be stable?</p>
<p>If you have a farm, there&rsquo;s one farmer and 50 cows,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very stable.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just not, you&rsquo;re not asking the cows</p>
<p>where to farm things.</p>
<p>Yeah, but the cows aren&rsquo;t intelligent enough to do damage.</p>
<p>Cows certainly, bulls,</p>
<p>because they could do a lot of damage.</p>
<p>They could trample things, they could attack you.</p>
<p>Cows are like, how much do they weigh, like 4,000 pounds?</p>
<p>Can you connect the analogy then?</p>
<p>Because like.</p>
<p>Sure, you can&rsquo;t expect that.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Saying a cow is a cow isn&rsquo;t a slur.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not saying you hate cows.</p>
<p>Cows, or even, let&rsquo;s say,</p>
<p>the example I always use with good reason is dogs, okay?</p>
<p>I always say to study how human beings operate,</p>
<p>watch Cesar Millan,</p>
<p>because human beings and dogs have co evolved.</p>
<p>Our minds have both evolved in parallel tracks</p>
<p>to communicate with each other.</p>
<p>Dogs are, can be vicious.</p>
<p>Dogs for the most part are great, wonderful,</p>
<p>but you can&rsquo;t expect the dog</p>
<p>to understand certain concepts.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not an, and now most people are offended.</p>
<p>Are you saying I&rsquo;m like a dog?</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a dog person like I am,</p>
<p>this is actually a huge compliment.</p>
<p>Most dogs are better than most people,</p>
<p>but to get the idea that this is something</p>
<p>that is basically your peer is nonsensical.</p>
<p>Now, of course this sounds arrogant and elitist</p>
<p>and so on and so forth,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m perfectly happy with that,</p>
<p>but it is very hard to persuade me or anyone</p>
<p>that if you walk, George Carlin has that joke,</p>
<p>think how smart the average person is,</p>
<p>then realize 50% of people are dumber than that.</p>
<p>If you walk around and see who&rsquo;s out there,</p>
<p>these people are very kind.</p>
<p>They are of value.</p>
<p>They deserve to be treated with respect.</p>
<p>They deserve to be secure in their person.</p>
<p>They deserve to feel safe and to have love,</p>
<p>but the expectation that they should have</p>
<p>any sort of semblance of power over me or my life</p>
<p>is as nonsensical as asking Lassie to be my accountant.</p>
<p>So, but that goes to power,</p>
<p>that not to the ability, the capacity</p>
<p>to be empathetic, compassionate, intelligent.</p>
<p>What, if I were to try to prove you wrong?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good question, okay.</p>
<p>What would you be impressed by about society?</p>
<p>How would I show it to you?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good question.</p>
<p>How would you show it to me?</p>
<p>Because I think something has to be falsifiable</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re gonna make a claim, right?</p>
<p>So what would it?</p>
<p>Because we both made claims</p>
<p>that aren&rsquo;t a kind of our own like interpretation</p>
<p>based on our interaction.</p>
<p>Like when I opened Twitter, everyone seems to say.</p>
<p>Why do you only follow one person?</p>
<p>Who do you follow?</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s the one person you follow?</p>
<p>Stoic Emperor.</p>
<p>I follow a lot of people.</p>
<p>I have a script.</p>
<p>I have a script that I have an entire interface.</p>
<p>So I think Twitter is really.</p>
<p>This is real love.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not ironic love.</p>
<p>I love watching it and I&rsquo;m sure you do too.</p>
<p>I love watching a quality mind at work</p>
<p>because when someone has a quality mind,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re often not self aware.</p>
<p>I catch this on myself of how it operates</p>
<p>and then when other people see it,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re like, oh my God, this is so beautiful</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s such an innocence to it.</p>
<p>But like when I opened Twitter, I&rsquo;m energized.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of love on Twitter.</p>
<p>People say like.</p>
<p>I love Twitter.</p>
<p>I agree.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t think I have a lot of love on Twitter?</p>
<p>My fans pay my rent.</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t know your experience of Twitter,</p>
<p>but when I look at your,</p>
<p>which is a fundamentally different thing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m saying my experience from the.</p>
<p>So maybe you can tell me what your experience</p>
<p>is like as a human.</p>
<p>So when I observe your Twitter,</p>
<p>I think, I wouldn&rsquo;t call it love.</p>
<p>I would call it fun.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And because of that, that&rsquo;s a different kind of,</p>
<p>that like love emerges from that</p>
<p>because people kind of learn that we&rsquo;re having,</p>
<p>this is like game night, like.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>You know, we can talk shit a little bit.</p>
<p>We can, and you can even like pull in,</p>
<p>you can make fun of people.</p>
<p>You can have the crazy uncle come over</p>
<p>that is a huge Trump supporter,</p>
<p>somebody who hates Trump and you can have a little fun.</p>
<p>I get it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a different kind of thing.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to be the,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re the host of game night.</p>
<p>Yes, yes.</p>
<p>So I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to host that kind of game night.</p>
<p>I imagine you programming your robots</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re asking what is fun</p>
<p>and it just starts sparking.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What is fun?</p>
<p>So the robots in my life that survive</p>
<p>are the ones that don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>that like survive that whole programming process.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re kind of like,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re kind of like the idiot from Dostoevsky,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re very like simple minded robots.</p>
<p>Fun is moving a can from one table to another.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s game night for our kin.</p>
<p>You know, one of my quotes is,</p>
<p>and I think about this every day</p>
<p>and I mean it with every fiber of my being,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re born knowing that life is a magical adventure</p>
<p>and it takes them years to train us to think otherwise.</p>
<p>And I think that Willy Wonka approach,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a very Camus approach.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s something I believe with every fiber of my being.</p>
<p>I try to spread that as much as possible.</p>
<p>I think it is very sad.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not being sarcastic.</p>
<p>It comes off as condescending.</p>
<p>I mean it at face value.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very sad how many people are not receptive to that.</p>
<p>And I think a lot of those functions,</p>
<p>how they were raised.</p>
<p>And I could have very easily with my upbringing</p>
<p>have not maintained that perspective.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a lot of,</p>
<p>I have a lot of friends in recovery like AA</p>
<p>and they have an expression,</p>
<p>not my circus, not my monkeys, right?</p>
<p>That you can&rsquo;t really take on other people&rsquo;s problems</p>
<p>on your own at a certain point,</p>
<p>they have to do the work themselves</p>
<p>because you can only do so much externally.</p>
<p>And there are a lot of very damaged people out there.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re damaged people who revel in being damaged.</p>
<p>And they are damaged people who desperately,</p>
<p>desperately, desperately wanna be well,</p>
<p>who desperately wanna be happy,</p>
<p>who desperately wanna find joy.</p>
<p>So if I can be the one and as arrogant as this sounds,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll own it, who does give them that fun</p>
<p>and to tell them it doesn&rsquo;t have to be like you thought.</p>
<p>Like it could be, it&rsquo;s gonna hurt, it&rsquo;s gonna suck,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s still a magical adventure</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re gonna be okay,</p>
<p>cause you&rsquo;ve been through worse.</p>
<p>Like that, if that could be my message,</p>
<p>I would own it all day long.</p>
<p>And so what does adventure look like for you?</p>
<p>Cause I mean, it actually boils down to,</p>
<p>I still disagree with you.</p>
<p>I think trolling can be</p>
<p>and very often is destructive for society.</p>
<p>Yes, I want to destroy society.</p>
<p>That is the goal.</p>
<p>I want to help many people.</p>
<p>Unironically, okay.</p>
<p>Unironically, yes.</p>
<p>What do I do with that?</p>
<p>Okay, so.</p>
<p>Whatever you want.</p>
<p>Do what thou wilt is the hall of the law.</p>
<p>Like I just wanna,</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re hosting game night</p>
<p>and I just wanna play Monopoly.</p>
<p>I wanna play, what&rsquo;s it, Risk.</p>
<p>Okay, I wanna play these games.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re saying. Those are aggressive games.</p>
<p>Yeah, I was trying to think like of a friendlier game,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re all kind of aggressive.</p>
<p>Battleship.</p>
<p>Axis and allies, you know, fun stuff.</p>
<p>But like, so that&rsquo;s an adventure,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re saying that we want to destroy everything.</p>
<p>Even like the rules of those games are not.</p>
<p>You voluntarily agree to those rules.</p>
<p>The point is if someone comes in</p>
<p>who no one invited to game night</p>
<p>and are telling you, no, when you play Monopoly,</p>
<p>you have to get money when you land in free parking</p>
<p>or you don&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s like, who are you?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re having our own fun and you smell.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, but there&rsquo;s an aggressive.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an aggression.</p>
<p>Let me speak to that, which I think you&rsquo;re picking up on.</p>
<p>I had a friend named Martha, Marcia, excuse me.</p>
<p>She ran something called cuddle parties,</p>
<p>which people laughed at about a lot back in the day.</p>
<p>And the premise of the cuddle parties,</p>
<p>everyone got together and cuddled, right?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, ah, ha, ha.</p>
<p>Then you stop to think about it</p>
<p>and you realize physical contact is extremely important.</p>
<p>And a lot of people don&rsquo;t have it.</p>
<p>And if this is a mechanism of people getting that,</p>
<p>it actually is going to have</p>
<p>profound positive psychological consequences.</p>
<p>So after she explained it, I&rsquo;m like, okay,</p>
<p>we laughed at this because it&rsquo;s weird.</p>
<p>And now that I think about it, this is wonderful.</p>
<p>And I asked her about like the tough question,</p>
<p>I go, what if guys get turned on?</p>
<p>And on their website, it even has a rule,</p>
<p>like do not fear the erection, right?</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s going to be a natural consequence</p>
<p>of physical proximity.</p>
<p>And the point she goes, she said this,</p>
<p>I think about this all the time.</p>
<p>People will take as much space as you let them.</p>
<p>It is incumbent on each of us to set our own boundaries.</p>
<p>We all have to learn when to say,</p>
<p>no, you&rsquo;re making me uncomfortable.</p>
<p>If someone doesn&rsquo;t respect your right</p>
<p>to have your boundary to be uncomfortable,</p>
<p>this person is not your friend.</p>
<p>Now they can say, I don&rsquo;t understand.</p>
<p>Like, why is this okay?</p>
<p>Why is that not?</p>
<p>Let me know you better so I&rsquo;m respectful of you.</p>
<p>But if they roll their eyes and they&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>get over, I&rsquo;m going to do what I want,</p>
<p>this person is not interested in knowing you as a human being.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And that is the aggression.</p>
<p>You have to draw those lines.</p>
<p>I mean, but that&rsquo;s a very positive way</p>
<p>of phrasing that aggression.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a very positive person.</p>
<p>But the trolling, there&rsquo;s a destructive thing to it.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>That hurts others.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not bad people.</p>
<p>I only troll as a reaction or towards those in power.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So maybe let&rsquo;s talk about trolling a little bit.</p>
<p>Because trolling, when it can, maybe you can correct me,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve seen it become a game for people</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s enjoyable in itself.</p>
<p>I disagree with that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not a good thing.</p>
<p>If you are there just to hurt innocent people,</p>
<p>you are a horrible human being.</p>
<p>But doesn&rsquo;t trolling too easily become that?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know about easily.</p>
<p>Let me give you an example of where trolling came from.</p>
<p>The original troll was Andy Kaufman.</p>
<p>He was on the show Taxi.</p>
<p>He was a performance artist, not a stand up comedian.</p>
<p>And this is a quintessential example of trolling.</p>
<p>He had a character where he was basically</p>
<p>like a lounge singer.</p>
<p>He had these glasses on and just a terrible singer</p>
<p>and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>And he denied it was him.</p>
<p>And he came out and I&rsquo;m blanking on the guy&rsquo;s name.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t believe it.</p>
<p>Tony Clifton.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>He came out in the audience and he goes,</p>
<p>you know, my wife died a few years ago.</p>
<p>Every time I look at my daughter Sarah&rsquo;s eyes,</p>
<p>I can see my wife.</p>
<p>Sarah, come out here.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s do a duet.</p>
<p>And Sarah was like 11, sits on his lap.</p>
<p>They start singing duet.</p>
<p>Her voice cracks.</p>
<p>He smacks her across the face.</p>
<p>What the hell are you doing?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re making an ass out of me in front of these people.</p>
<p>She starts crying.</p>
<p>The audience is booing and he goes,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t boo her, you&rsquo;re just gonna make her cry more.</p>
<p>Now it ends.</p>
<p>This wasn&rsquo;t his daughter.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t even a child.</p>
<p>It was an actress.</p>
<p>This was all set up.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s exploiting their love of children</p>
<p>in order to force them to be performers.</p>
<p>That is trolling.</p>
<p>No one is actually getting hurt.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a humorous, though twisted exchange.</p>
<p>If you go online looking for weak people</p>
<p>and you are there to denigrate them</p>
<p>just for them being weak or in some way inferior to you,</p>
<p>that is the wrong approach.</p>
<p>I am best on the counter punch.</p>
<p>A lot of times people come to me</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll be like, I hope you die.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re ugly.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re disgusting.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s this great quote from Billy Idol,</p>
<p>which I&rsquo;m gonna mango here, something effective.</p>
<p>I love it when people are rude to me,</p>
<p>then I can stop pretending to be nice.</p>
<p>Then you start fights.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s a chance for me to finish it</p>
<p>and make an example of this person.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s very, very different from</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna go around and humiliate people</p>
<p>for the sake of doing it, in my view.</p>
<p>And I can see how one would lead to the other.</p>
<p>Yeah, but that&rsquo;s my fundamental concern with it.</p>
<p>So my dream is to put, use technology,</p>
<p>create platforms that increase</p>
<p>the amount of love in the world.</p>
<p>And to me, trolling is doing the opposite.</p>
<p>So like Andy Kaufman is brilliant.</p>
<p>So I love, obviously, it sounds like I&rsquo;m a robot thing.</p>
<p>I love humor, okay?</p>
<p>Humor is good.</p>
<p>One, one, one, zero, one, one, one, one.</p>
<p>But like, it&rsquo;s, I just see like 4chan.</p>
<p>I see that you can often see that humor quickly turn.</p>
<p>Yeah, because what happens is a lot of low status people,</p>
<p>this is their one mechanism through sadism</p>
<p>to feel empowered, and then they can hide behind,</p>
<p>well, I&rsquo;m just joking.</p>
<p>Yeah, like there&rsquo;s this dark thing.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s not acceptable.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s something you can&rsquo;t have.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a dark LOL that people do,</p>
<p>which is like they&rsquo;ll say like the shittiest thing.</p>
<p>Right, because they feel. And then do LOL after.</p>
<p>Like, as if, I don&rsquo;t even know like what is happening</p>
<p>in that dark mind of yours.</p>
<p>Because they are feeling powerless in their lives,</p>
<p>and they see someone who they perceive as higher status</p>
<p>or more powerful than them, or even not appear,</p>
<p>and they, through their words,</p>
<p>cause a reaction in this person.</p>
<p>So they feel like they are, in a very literal sense,</p>
<p>making a difference on earth,</p>
<p>and they matter in a very dark way.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s disturbing.</p>
<p>This is not, I mean, it&rsquo;s unfortunate</p>
<p>that that term trolling is used for that,</p>
<p>as opposed to what Andy Kaufman does,</p>
<p>as opposed to what I do.</p>
<p>It really is a sinister thing,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;m not at all a fan of.</p>
<p>How do we fight that?</p>
<p>So, like a neighboring concept of that</p>
<p>is conspiracy theories, which is.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;re neighboring at all.</p>
<p>Well, let me give a sort of naive perspective.</p>
<p>Maybe you can educate me on this.</p>
<p>From my perspective, conspiracy theories</p>
<p>are these constructs of ideas</p>
<p>that go deeper and deeper and deeper</p>
<p>into creating worlds</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s powerful pedophiles controlling things,</p>
<p>like these very sophisticated models of the world</p>
<p>that in part might be true,</p>
<p>but in large part, I would say,</p>
<p>are figments of imagination</p>
<p>that become really useful constructs.</p>
<p>Self reinforcing.</p>
<p>Self reinforcing for then feeding,</p>
<p>like empowering the trolls</p>
<p>to attack the powerful, the conventionally powerful.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s a function of conspiracy theories.</p>
<p>Now, let&rsquo;s talk about conspiracy theories,</p>
<p>because one of my quotes is,</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You take one red pill, not the whole bottle.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>This concept that everything in life</p>
<p>is at the function of a small cadre of individuals</p>
<p>would be, for many people, reassuring,</p>
<p>because as bad as it looks, you know they,</p>
<p>whoever they are, it&rsquo;s usually the Jews,</p>
<p>aren&rsquo;t gonna let it get that bad, that they will pull back.</p>
<p>Or the black pill is that they aren&rsquo;t intentionally</p>
<p>trying to destroy everything,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s nothing we can do and we&rsquo;re doomed.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s an amazing book by Arthur Herman</p>
<p>called The Idea of Declined Western History.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of my top 10 books</p>
<p>where he goes through every 20 years</p>
<p>how there&rsquo;s a different population that say,</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It&rsquo;s the end of the world, here&rsquo;s the proof.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>And very often, the proof is something</p>
<p>that is kind of self fulfilling,</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s not falsifiable.</p>
<p>And we both have to think of ways</p>
<p>to falsify our claims from earlier.</p>
<p>So it is a big danger.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a big danger online, because very quickly,</p>
<p>if someone who you thought was good,</p>
<p>but now is bad on one aspect,</p>
<p>well, they&rsquo;re controlled opposition,</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;ve been taken over,</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;ve been kind of appropriated by the bad people,</p>
<p>whoever those bad people would be.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know that I have a good answer for this.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s as pervasive as people think.</p>
<p>The number of people who believe conspiracy theory?</p>
<p>Right, I mean, and also conspiracy theory</p>
<p>is a term used to dismiss ideas that have some currency.</p>
<p>The Constitutional Convention was a conspiracy.</p>
<p>The Founding Fathers got together secretly</p>
<p>on this war to secrecy in Philadelphia,</p>
<p>said, we&rsquo;re throwing out the Articles of Confederation,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re making a new government, right, yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>And Luther Martin left, and he told everyone,</p>
<p>this is a conspiracy, and they&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>yeah, whatever, Luther Martin.</p>
<p>So, and Jeffrey Epstein was a conspiracy,</p>
<p>Harvey Weinstein was a conspiracy,</p>
<p>Bill Cosby was a conspiracy.</p>
<p>They all knew, they didn&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>Communist infiltration in America,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a great book by Eugene Lyons</p>
<p>called The Red Decade.</p>
<p>They all knew every atrocity</p>
<p>that was done under Stalinism was excused in the West,</p>
<p>and if you didn&rsquo;t believe it,</p>
<p>oh, you&rsquo;ve got this crazy anti Russia conspiracy.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a term that is weaponized in a negative sense,</p>
<p>but that does not at all imply</p>
<p>that it does not have very negative real life consequences</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s kind of a cult of one, right?</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m at home with my computer,</p>
<p>I bang into this ideology,</p>
<p>anyone who doesn&rsquo;t agree with me,</p>
<p>they are blind, they&rsquo;re oblivious,</p>
<p>mom and dad, my friends, you don&rsquo;t get it.</p>
<p>We were warned about people like you,</p>
<p>and I think there&rsquo;s a very heavy correlation,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m not a psychiatrist, of course,</p>
<p>between that and certain types of mild mental illness,</p>
<p>like some kind of paranoid schizophrenia</p>
<p>and things like that, because after a certain point,</p>
<p>if everything is a function of this conspiracy,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no randomness or beauty in life.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, I don&rsquo;t know if you can say</p>
<p>anything interesting about it in the way of advice</p>
<p>of how to take a step into conspiracy theory world</p>
<p>without completely going, like diving deep,</p>
<p>because it seems like that&rsquo;s what happens.</p>
<p>People can&rsquo;t look at Jeffrey Epstein.</p>
<p>I can tell you what the advice I&rsquo;d have</p>
<p>is, seriously and rigorously, without going,</p>
<p>because you can look at Jeffrey Epstein</p>
<p>and say there&rsquo;s a deeper thing.</p>
<p>You can always go deeper.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like Jeffrey Epstein was just a tool</p>
<p>of the lizard people, and the lizard people are the tool.</p>
<p>Well, they say Satanists, in this case.</p>
<p>Somehow, recently, very popular,</p>
<p>spedophiles somehow always involved.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not understanding any of that.</p>
<p>Legitimately, I say this both humorously and seriously.</p>
<p>I need to look into it, and I guess the bigger question</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m asking, how does a serious human being,</p>
<p>somebody with a position at a respectable university,</p>
<p>look at a conspiracy theory and look into it?</p>
<p>When I look at somebody like Jeffrey Epstein,</p>
<p>who had a role at MIT, and I think I&rsquo;m not happy,</p>
<p>personally, I wasn&rsquo;t there when Jeffrey Epstein was there.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not happy with the behavior of people now</p>
<p>about Jeffrey Epstein, about the bureaucracy</p>
<p>and the everybody&rsquo;s trying to keep quiet,</p>
<p>hoping it blows over, without really looking into any,</p>
<p>looking in a deep philosophical way</p>
<p>of how do we let this human being be among us?</p>
<p>Can I give you a better example that is conspiratorial?</p>
<p>The Speaker of the House,</p>
<p>the longest serving Republican Speaker of the House,</p>
<p>Dennis Hastert, was a pedophile.</p>
<p>He went to jail.</p>
<p>The Democrats don&rsquo;t throw this</p>
<p>in the Republicans faces every five minutes.</p>
<p>Not even Democratic activists.</p>
<p>I find that very, very odd, and not what I would predict.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;m not saying there&rsquo;s some kind of conspiracy,</p>
<p>but when it comes to things like sexual predation,</p>
<p>which is something that I&rsquo;m very, very concerned about.</p>
<p>I have an uncle now.</p>
<p>My sister just had her second kid recently.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s adorable.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s something that I don&rsquo;t understand.</p>
<p>It feels as if there&rsquo;s a lot of people</p>
<p>who want this to all go away.</p>
<p>Now, I think it&rsquo;s also because we don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>the vocabulary and framework to discuss it,</p>
<p>because when you start talking about things like children</p>
<p>and these kind of issues, we want to believe it&rsquo;s all crap,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s, for those of us</p>
<p>who aren&rsquo;t in this kind of mindset,</p>
<p>the idea that this happens to kids and happens frequently</p>
<p>is something so horrible that it&rsquo;s just like,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even want to hear it,</p>
<p>and that does these children and adult survivors</p>
<p>an enormous disservice.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know that I have any particular insight on this.</p>
<p>But see, how do you, the Catholic Church,</p>
<p>again, there&rsquo;s all these topics that.</p>
<p>Public school teachers are far more proportionately</p>
<p>peders of children than the Catholic Church.</p>
<p>Man, I don&rsquo;t know what, you&rsquo;re right, you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>Perhaps I&rsquo;ve been reading a lot about Stalin and Hitler,</p>
<p>somehow it&rsquo;s more comforting to be able to.</p>
<p>Yeah, because it&rsquo;s there, and then.</p>
<p>And then, and then the atrocities that are happening now,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a little bit more difficult because.</p>
<p>There was a New York Times article, sorry to interrupt you,</p>
<p>where they had people tracking down child pornography.</p>
<p>And I think the article said they didn&rsquo;t have enough people</p>
<p>just to cover the videotapes of infants being raped.</p>
<p>And we can even wrap our heads around reading Lolita,</p>
<p>like, okay, she&rsquo;s 14, 12, okay, it&rsquo;s still a female.</p>
<p>An infant, it&rsquo;s something that,</p>
<p>again, like with the Stalin example,</p>
<p>we sat down here for a hundred years,</p>
<p>we would never think of something like this,</p>
<p>think of it in a sexual context, it makes no sense.</p>
<p>So, and the fact that this is international,</p>
<p>okay, we eliminated completely in America.</p>
<p>Well, then they&rsquo;re gonna go find,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s infants all over the world,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s video cameras all over the world.</p>
<p>So then it has to become a conspiracy</p>
<p>because someone has to film it, I&rsquo;m filming it,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re buying it, your kid.</p>
<p>It is literally a conspiratorial,</p>
<p>not in the sense of like a mafia conspiracy</p>
<p>or some government illuminati,</p>
<p>but there is our networks designed to produce this product.</p>
<p>See, but like what I&rsquo;m trying to do now,</p>
<p>and part of the, one of the nice things</p>
<p>with like a podcast and other things I&rsquo;m involved with</p>
<p>is removing myself from having any kind of boss</p>
<p>so I can do whatever that helps.</p>
<p>Oh, it&rsquo;s so wonderful, that just happened to me,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the most wonderful thing ever.</p>
<p>So I could do, I can actually, in moderation,</p>
<p>consider like look into stuff.</p>
<p>Careful though, I was gonna write a book about this</p>
<p>that people pointed out,</p>
<p>you sure wanna do this research?</p>
<p>Because if you start Googling around</p>
<p>for this kind of stuff, it&rsquo;s on your computer.</p>
<p>Oh, in that sense, I&rsquo;m more concerned about,</p>
<p>you know, it&rsquo;s the Nietzsche thing,</p>
<p>looking into the abyss, like you wanna be very,</p>
<p>I believe I can do this kind of thing in moderation</p>
<p>without slipping into the depths.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s intelligence, that&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>I recently quote unquote looked into like</p>
<p>the UFO community, the extraterrestrial,</p>
<p>whatever community.</p>
<p>I think it always frustrated me</p>
<p>that the scientific community like rolled their eyes</p>
<p>at all the UFO sightings, all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Even though there could be fascinating, beautiful,</p>
<p>physical fun, like, first of all,</p>
<p>there could legit. Like ball lightning.</p>
<p>The ball lightning, right, that&rsquo;s at the very basic level</p>
<p>is a fascinating thing.</p>
<p>And also, it could be something like,</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t know, but it could be something interesting,</p>
<p>like worth looking into.</p>
<p>My grandfather was an air traffic controller</p>
<p>back in the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>And he said, we saw this stuff all the time.</p>
<p>These are planes that were not moving</p>
<p>or whatever things that were not moving</p>
<p>according to anything we knew about.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s absolutely real.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not some jerk with an iPhone in his backyard.</p>
<p>This is a military professional who understood technology,</p>
<p>who knew where the secret bases were.</p>
<p>So if he&rsquo;s telling me, it doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s Martians,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s telling me there&rsquo;s something there.</p>
<p>And there are many examples of these like military people.</p>
<p>These aren&rsquo;t some layman who sees a store.</p>
<p>Yeah, these are legit people.</p>
<p>Yeah, and so you can dismiss,</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re talking about professionals</p>
<p>who are around aircraft all the time,</p>
<p>who are familiar with aircraft at the highest levels,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re seeing things that they can&rsquo;t explain,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re clearly not stupid</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re clearly not under form.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s different ways to dismiss it.</p>
<p>For example, you were saying</p>
<p>that trolling is a good mechanism.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m against that, but I&rsquo;m not dismissing it</p>
<p>by like rolling my eyes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m considering legitimately that you&rsquo;re way smarter than me</p>
<p>and you understand the world better than me.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m allowing myself to consider that possibility</p>
<p>and thinking about it.</p>
<p>Like maybe that&rsquo;s true, like seriously considering it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I feel the way people should approach</p>
<p>intelligent people, serious quote unquote people,</p>
<p>scientists should approach conspiracy theories.</p>
<p>Like look at it carefully.</p>
<p>First of all, is it possible that the earth is flat?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not trivial to show that the earth is not flat.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very good exercise.</p>
<p>You should go through it.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>But once you go through it,</p>
<p>you realize that based on a lot of data</p>
<p>and a lot of evidence,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a lot of different experiments</p>
<p>you can do yourself actually</p>
<p>to show that the earth is not flat.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>The same kind of process can be taken</p>
<p>for a lot of different conspiracy theories</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s helpful.</p>
<p>And without slipping into the depths of lizard people</p>
<p>running everything.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where I&rsquo;ve now listened to two episodes</p>
<p>of Alex Jones&rsquo;s show</p>
<p>because he goes crazy deep</p>
<p>into different kind of worldviews</p>
<p>that I was not familiar with.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know what to make of it.</p>
<p>I mean, the reason I&rsquo;ve been listening to it</p>
<p>is because there&rsquo;s been a lot of discussions</p>
<p>about platforming of different people.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve been thinking about what does censorship mean?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking about whether,</p>
<p>because Joe Rogan said he&rsquo;s gonna have Alex on again.</p>
<p>And then I enjoyed it as a fan,</p>
<p>just the entertainment of it.</p>
<p>But then I actually listened to Alex</p>
<p>and I was thinking,</p>
<p>is this human being dangerous for the world?</p>
<p>Like is the ideas he&rsquo;s saying dangerous for the world?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m more concerned with the Russian conspiracy</p>
<p>that we had for three years.</p>
<p>The claim that our election was not legitimate</p>
<p>and that everyone in the Trump White House</p>
<p>is a stooge of Putin.</p>
<p>And the people who said this had no consequences for this.</p>
<p>Alex Jones doesn&rsquo;t have the respect that they do.</p>
<p>These are both areas of concern for me.</p>
<p>But he might if he&rsquo;s given more platform.</p>
<p>So like the people who&rsquo;ve,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;d be curious to,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also a little bit,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what to think about the idea</p>
<p>that Russians hacked the election.</p>
<p>That it seems too easily accepted in the mainstream media.</p>
<p>Hillary Clinton said that how they did it</p>
<p>was they had ads on the dark web.</p>
<p>Now you and I both know what the dark web is.</p>
<p>So the possibility of ads on the dark web</p>
<p>having a proportional influence on the election</p>
<p>is literally zero.</p>
<p>Perhaps I should look into it more carefully,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve found very little good data</p>
<p>on exactly what did the Russians do to hack elections.</p>
<p>Like technically speaking,</p>
<p>what are we talking about here?</p>
<p>Like as opposed to these kind of weird,</p>
<p>like the best thing there&rsquo;s a couple of books</p>
<p>and like reporting on like farms.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Troll farms, yeah.</p>
<p>Troll farms.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s see the data.</p>
<p>Like how many exactly?</p>
<p>What are we talking about?</p>
<p>Like what were they doing?</p>
<p>Not just like some anecdotal discussions of,</p>
<p>but like relative to the bigger,</p>
<p>the size of Facebook.</p>
<p>Like if there&rsquo;s a few people, several hundreds,</p>
<p>say posting different political things on Facebook</p>
<p>relative to the full size of Facebook.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at the full size.</p>
<p>Right, you&rsquo;re thinking like a scientist.</p>
<p>The actual impact.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Like, cause it&rsquo;s fascinating the social dynamics</p>
<p>of viral information of videos.</p>
<p>When Donald Trump retweets something,</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s understudied the effect of that.</p>
<p>Like he retweeted a clip with Joe Rogan</p>
<p>and Mike Tyson, where Mike Tyson says</p>
<p>that he finds fighting orgasmic.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t understand that, but they&rsquo;d be fascinating</p>
<p>to think like what is the ripple effect</p>
<p>on the social dynamic of our society</p>
<p>from retweeting a clip about Mike Tyson.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your favorite Trump tweet?</p>
<p>I tuned them out a long time ago, unfortunately.</p>
<p>I have, this goes to the,</p>
<p>you and I have a different relationship with Donald Trump.</p>
<p>You appreciate the art form of trolling.</p>
<p>Sexual versus nonsexual.</p>
<p>Nonsexual, yeah.</p>
<p>So I tend to prefer Bill Clinton.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s more my type.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m just kidding.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t like that consent stuff.</p>
<p>No, the consent, no.</p>
<p>No, you appreciate the art form of trolling</p>
<p>and Donald Trump is a master.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the da Vinci of trolling.</p>
<p>So I tend to think that trolling</p>
<p>is ultimately destructive for society</p>
<p>and then Donald Trump takes nothing seriously.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s playing a game.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s making a game out of everything.</p>
<p>He takes a lot of things seriously.</p>
<p>I think he&rsquo;s very committed to international peace.</p>
<p>Sorry, I shouldn&rsquo;t speak so strong.</p>
<p>I think he takes, actually, yes,</p>
<p>a lot of things seriously.</p>
<p>I meant on Twitter and the game of politics.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>He is, he only takes.</p>
<p>Irreverently.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And I appreciate it.</p>
<p>I just would like to focus on</p>
<p>genuine, real expressions of humanity,</p>
<p>especially positive.</p>
<p>Well, this is one.</p>
<p>This is my favorite tweet.</p>
<p>My fans got it lasered, etched,</p>
<p>and put in a block of Lucite for me.</p>
<p>And he said, every time I speak of the losers and haters,</p>
<p>I do so with great affection.</p>
<p>They cannot help the fact that they were born fucked up.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an actual Trump tweet.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s my favorite one.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s kind of nice.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s love.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s love.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s kind of nice.</p>
<p>Great affection.</p>
<p>That, I mean.</p>
<p>Exclamation point.</p>
<p>I broke Lex.</p>
<p>What is love?</p>
<p>Yeah, the sparks are flying.</p>
<p>But I have to kind of analyze that</p>
<p>from a literary perspective,</p>
<p>but it seems like there&rsquo;s love in there.</p>
<p>Like a little bit.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little bit lighthearted.</p>
<p>Cause he&rsquo;s saying, even when I&rsquo;m going after them,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t take it so seriously.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s nice.</p>
<p>It is nice.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s acknowledging the game of it.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s nice.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not always.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some things he&rsquo;s very, very vicious.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Very vicious.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s done things that I can tell you about</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m like, this is a bad person.</p>
<p>What do you think about one of the,</p>
<p>okay, listen, I&rsquo;m not,</p>
<p>for people listening,</p>
<p>I do not have Trump derangement syndrome.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t, I see,</p>
<p>I try to look for the good and the bad in everybody.</p>
<p>One thing, perhaps it&rsquo;s irrational,</p>
<p>but perhaps because I&rsquo;ve been reading history,</p>
<p>I, the one triggering thing for me</p>
<p>is the delaying of elections.</p>
<p>I believe in elections.</p>
<p>And this is the part that you probably disagree with,</p>
<p>but I, you know, I believe in the value of people voting.</p>
<p>And I just seen too many dictators,</p>
<p>the place where they finally,</p>
<p>the big switch happens</p>
<p>when you question the legitimacy of elections.</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s been questioning the legitimacy of elections</p>
<p>for the last three years?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve only heard Donald Trump do it last year,</p>
<p>but the last three years you&rsquo;re saying somebody else?</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t think, not my president, illegitimate,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not gonna normalize him as president,</p>
<p>Russia hacked this election, impeached,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not a real president.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s questioning the legitimacy of 2016?</p>
<p>Nah, it&rsquo;s a good, I haven&rsquo;t been paying attention enough,</p>
<p>but I would imagine that argument has been,</p>
<p>that I haven&rsquo;t actually heard too many people,</p>
<p>but I imagine that&rsquo;s been a popular thing to say.</p>
<p>Okay, I, but nevertheless, that&rsquo;s a part,</p>
<p>that didn&rsquo;t, that&rsquo;s not a statement</p>
<p>that gained power enough to say</p>
<p>that Barack Obama will keep being president</p>
<p>or Hillary Clinton should be president.</p>
<p>Newsweek had that article,</p>
<p>how Hillary Clinton could still be president, Newsweek.</p>
<p>No, but she&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m saying.</p>
<p>My worry isn&rsquo;t, my worry isn&rsquo;t saying</p>
<p>that the election was illegitimate</p>
<p>and people whining at a mass scale</p>
<p>and then Fox News or CNN reporting for years</p>
<p>or books being written for years.</p>
<p>My worry is legitimately martial law.</p>
<p>A person stays president.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s the issue.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s a phase shift that happens in a dictatorship.</p>
<p>I did a book on North Korea.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not someone who thinks dictatorship should be taken</p>
<p>lightly.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not someone who thinks it can&rsquo;t happen here.</p>
<p>I think a lot of times people are desperate</p>
<p>for dictatorship.</p>
<p>So I am with you.</p>
<p>And I think this is something,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re gonna hand wave it away,</p>
<p>everyone else hand waved it away.</p>
<p>Hitler&rsquo;s never gonna be chancellor.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like lunatic.</p>
<p>Oh, please.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a joke.</p>
<p>They couldn&rsquo;t find a publisher for Mein Kampf in English</p>
<p>because this is some guy from some random minor party</p>
<p>in Germany spouting nonsense.</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s gonna read this crap?</p>
<p>So I completely agree with you in that regard.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;re there.</p>
<p>My point is Donald Trump this year</p>
<p>had every pathway open to him to declare martial law.</p>
<p>The cities are being burned down.</p>
<p>He could have very easily sent in the tanks</p>
<p>and people would have been applauding him from his side.</p>
<p>You make me feel so good right now.</p>
<p>But am I wrong though?</p>
<p>No, I&hellip;</p>
<p>What he did, he tweeted out to Mayor Wheeler of Portland.</p>
<p>He said, call me.</p>
<p>We will solve this in minutes, but you have to call.</p>
<p>And he sat in his hands and they said, oh, it&rsquo;s his fault.</p>
<p>The city is burning down.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not doing anything.</p>
<p>And he goes, I&rsquo;m not doing anything</p>
<p>until you ask me to do it.</p>
<p>So I think that is,</p>
<p>even if you think he&rsquo;s an aspiring dictator,</p>
<p>that is at least a sign that there is some restraint</p>
<p>on his aspirations.</p>
<p>Can I just take that in as a beautiful moment of hope?</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m gonna remember this moment.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna miss Ted Cruz, beautiful Ted.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna remember that.</p>
<p>I mean, I should say that perhaps I&rsquo;m irrationally,</p>
<p>this is the one moment where I feel myself</p>
<p>being a little unhealthy.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re being irrational.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s an asymmetry</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s kind of like, okay,</p>
<p>either if I leave the house, it&rsquo;s like Russian roulette.</p>
<p>Yeah, maybe it&rsquo;s like a one in six shot.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pulling the trigger, I&rsquo;m killing myself,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s one in six.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not, and the consequences are so dire</p>
<p>that a little paranoia would go a long way.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something that.</p>
<p>But you can&rsquo;t go back.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an asymmetry, yeah.</p>
<p>The thing is, the thing that makes Donald Trump new to me,</p>
<p>and again, I&rsquo;m a little naive in these things,</p>
<p>but he surprised me</p>
<p>in how many ways he just didn&rsquo;t play by the rules.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s made me, a little ant in this ant colony,</p>
<p>think like, well, do you have to play by the rules at all?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Like, why are we having elections?</p>
<p>Why did you say, like, it&rsquo;s coronavirus time?</p>
<p>Like, it&rsquo;s not healthy to have elections.</p>
<p>Like, we shouldn&rsquo;t be, like, I could,</p>
<p>if I put my dictator hat on.</p>
<p>Nancy Pelosi said that Joe Biden shouldn&rsquo;t debate.</p>
<p>Yeah, did she?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>She says she shouldn&rsquo;t dignify Trump with a debate.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the president.</p>
<p>He could be the worst president on earth,</p>
<p>evil, despicable monster.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll take that as an argument.</p>
<p>So she&rsquo;s playing politics, but she&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s playing politics.</p>
<p>I think when there&rsquo;s a certain point where things get,</p>
<p>when you start attacking institutions</p>
<p>for the emergencies of the moment and acting arbitrarily,</p>
<p>that is when things are the slippery slope.</p>
<p>Yeah, so you&rsquo;re saying debates is one of the institutions.</p>
<p>Like, that&rsquo;s one of the traditions to have the debates.</p>
<p>I think the debates are extremely important.</p>
<p>And now I don&rsquo;t think that someone&rsquo;s a good debater</p>
<p>is gonna make a good president.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s a big problem.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re just saying this is attacking</p>
<p>just yet another tradition, yet another.</p>
<p>You know, like, how if you&rsquo;re dating,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re married to someone</p>
<p>and someone throws out the word divorce,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t unring that bell, you threw it out there.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m saying you don&rsquo;t throw things out like that</p>
<p>unless you really are ready to go down this road.</p>
<p>And I think that is,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s nothing in the constitution about debates.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve only had them since 1980,</p>
<p>but still, I think they are extremely important.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also a great chance for Joe Biden</p>
<p>to tell him to his face, you&rsquo;re full of crap,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s what you did, here&rsquo;s what you did,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s what you did.</p>
<p>So fascinating that you&rsquo;re both, you acknowledge that,</p>
<p>and yet you also see the value</p>
<p>of tearing down the entire thing.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re both worried about no debates,</p>
<p>or at least in your voice, in your tone.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a great quote by Chesterton.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a fan of him at all.</p>
<p>But he says, before you tear down a fence,</p>
<p>make sure you know why they put it up first.</p>
<p>So I am for tearing it all down,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s something called like a controlled demolition,</p>
<p>like building sevens, or there&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Allegedly.</p>
<p>We knew we were in Tel Aviv.</p>
<p>Hashtag building seven.</p>
<p>We knew we were in Tel Aviv.</p>
<p>Wow, you&rsquo;re faster than me.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re operating in a different level.</p>
<p>I need to upgrade my operating system.</p>
<p>I told you Windows 95.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re trying, yeah.</p>
<p>Building seven.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re gonna, it&rsquo;s like Indiana Jones, right?</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re gonna pull something away,</p>
<p>make sure you have something in place first,</p>
<p>as opposed to just breaking it,</p>
<p>and then just, especially in politics,</p>
<p>because it escalates.</p>
<p>And when things escalate without any kind of response,</p>
<p>it can go in a very bad, that&rsquo;s when Napoleon comes in.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s your prediction about the Biden Trump debates?</p>
<p>Again, I just have this weird,</p>
<p>maybe we&rsquo;ll return to maybe not in this,</p>
<p>how do we put more love into the world?</p>
<p>And one of the things that worries me about the debates</p>
<p>is it&rsquo;ll be the world&rsquo;s greatest troll</p>
<p>against the grandpa on the porch.</p>
<p>Who crapped his pants.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And it will not put more love into the world.</p>
<p>It will create more mockery, like.</p>
<p>Joe Biden did a great job against Paul Ryan in 2012.</p>
<p>Paul Ryan was no lightweight.</p>
<p>No one thought he was a lightweight.</p>
<p>Joe Biden handed Sarah Pail in her ass in 2008,</p>
<p>which isn&rsquo;t as easy to do as you think,</p>
<p>because she&rsquo;s a female.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re gonna come off as bullying.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s something you have to worry about.</p>
<p>So the guy isn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>I think he is in the stages of cognitive decline.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s going to be interesting.</p>
<p>I want it to be,</p>
<p>like Mike Tyson beating up a child,</p>
<p>cause it&rsquo;ll be a source of amusement to me.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t know how it&rsquo;s going to go.</p>
<p>Is it possible that Joe Biden will be the Mike Tyson?</p>
<p>Yes, because in his last debate with Bernie,</p>
<p>he was perfectly fine.</p>
<p>And again, the guy was a sender for decades.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think anyone,</p>
<p>if you looked at Joe Biden in 2010,</p>
<p>would have thought this guy is going to be,</p>
<p>have his ass handed him a debate.</p>
<p>You wouldn&rsquo;t think that at all.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know who we&rsquo;re going to see.</p>
<p>Plus he&rsquo;s got a lot of room to attack Trump.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;s going to come strapped and ready</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s going to have his talking points</p>
<p>and watch Trump dance, try to tap dance around him.</p>
<p>And if he&rsquo;s in a position,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what the rules of the debate are,</p>
<p>to actually nail him to the wall,</p>
<p>it might actually,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;s going to have a lot of lines too.</p>
<p>The problem is Trump is the master counter puncher.</p>
<p>So like when Hillary&rsquo;s had her line,</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s like, well, it&rsquo;s a good thing that Donald Trump</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t in charge of our legal system.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, yeah, you&rsquo;d be in jail.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, oh, lady, you set him up.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s painful to watch, those debates.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s something, I think it&rsquo;s actually analogous.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve come to think of it,</p>
<p>your conversation with me right now,</p>
<p>some Sleepy Joe, I&rsquo;m playing the role of Sleepy Joe.</p>
<p>I actually connect to Joe because there&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also incontinent.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s like these weird pauses that he does.</p>
<p>Yes, he does.</p>
<p>I do the same thing and it annoys the shit out of me</p>
<p>that like in mid sentence,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll start saying a different thing and take a tangent.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not as slow and drunk as I sound, always.</p>
<p>I swear I&rsquo;m more intelligent underneath it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m slower but less drunk.</p>
<p>Yes, exactly.</p>
<p>But the result, one of those is true, but not both, yeah.</p>
<p>And Trump, just like you, are a master counter puncher.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s gonna be messy.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the other thing, in all seriousness,</p>
<p>Chris Wallace is the moderator.</p>
<p>Chris Wallace has interviewed Trump several times</p>
<p>and he was a tough, tough questioner.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s gonna come in there</p>
<p>with softball questions.</p>
<p>I think he&rsquo;s really going to try to nail Trump down,</p>
<p>which is tough to do.</p>
<p>I like him a lot.</p>
<p>Yeah, and he&rsquo;s like, Mr. President, sir,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not accurate, blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s done it.</p>
<p>And Trump gets very frustrated</p>
<p>because he doesn&rsquo;t just let him say whatever he wants</p>
<p>and he hits him with the follow up.</p>
<p>I guess he&rsquo;s on Fox News.</p>
<p>And I listen to his Sunday program every once in a while.</p>
<p>He gives me hope that, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something in the voice that he&rsquo;s not bought.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no question he&rsquo;s gonna take this seriously,</p>
<p>which I think is the best you could hope for in a moderator.</p>
<p>It feels like there&rsquo;s people that might actually</p>
<p>take the mainstream media into a place</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to be better in the future.</p>
<p>And we need people like him.</p>
<p>You mean like Robespierre?</p>
<p>What do you mean?</p>
<p>Like taking the mainstream media to a better future.</p>
<p>Like bring out the guillotines.</p>
<p>See, you put your anarchist hat back on.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think Robespierre is much of an anarchist,</p>
<p>but yeah, I get what you&rsquo;re saying.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t think there should be a centralized place for news?</p>
<p>There isn&rsquo;t now.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s what mainstream media</p>
<p>is supposed to represent, and it&rsquo;s broken.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s not whatever, what do you call that?</p>
<p>A place where people traditionally said</p>
<p>was the legitimate source of truth.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what the media was supposed to represent, no?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s their big branding accomplishment.</p>
<p>That was never true?</p>
<p>Yeah, because here&rsquo;s what happens.</p>
<p>We remember the Spanish American War,</p>
<p>remember the Maine, we have to take Cuba,</p>
<p>yellow journalism, William Randolph Hearst, right?</p>
<p>Then record scratch, and then we&rsquo;re all objective.</p>
<p>Like when did this transition happen according to people?</p>
<p>When you were saying that the Kaiser</p>
<p>is the worst human being on earth?</p>
<p>When you were downplaying Stalin</p>
<p>and downplaying Hitler&rsquo;s atrocities?</p>
<p>When you were saying we had to be in Vietnam?</p>
<p>At what point, WMDs, when did it change?</p>
<p>It never changed.</p>
<p>You just are better con artists at a certain point,</p>
<p>and now the mask is dropping.</p>
<p>Yeah, but don&rsquo;t you think there&rsquo;s, at its best,</p>
<p>like investigative journalism can uncover truth</p>
<p>in a way that like Reddit, subreddits can&rsquo;t?</p>
<p>You know, Reddit, sure, I agree.</p>
<p>At its best, absolutely, that&rsquo;s not even a dispute.</p>
<p>But like, don&rsquo;t you think like fake it until you make it</p>
<p>is the right way to do it?</p>
<p>Meaning like the.</p>
<p>Fake the news?</p>
<p>No, no, no, I meant the news saying like,</p>
<p>we dream of doing, of arriving at the truth</p>
<p>and reporting the truth.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t say that.</p>
<p>CNN had an advertisement that said this is an apple.</p>
<p>We only report facts.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a lie.</p>
<p>No, that&rsquo;s now, and now it&rsquo;s clear things have changed.</p>
<p>They haven&rsquo;t changed.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just more, you&rsquo;re more aware of their chicanery.</p>
<p>But, okay, so the.</p>
<p>How many people died in Iraq?</p>
<p>Because Saddam Hussein was about to launch WMDs.</p>
<p>Who had consequences for this?</p>
<p>No one.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t a minor thing.</p>
<p>This is lots of dead people.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And also, I mean, dead people, it&rsquo;s horrible,</p>
<p>but also the money, which has, like we said,</p>
<p>economic effects that.</p>
<p>Marianne Williamson, I think it was, had the,</p>
<p>or Trump, both of them had the great point that goes,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like a trillion dollars.</p>
<p>How many schools would that build?</p>
<p>How many roads would that build?</p>
<p>Even here, why are we building hospitals in Iraq</p>
<p>that we destroyed when we could building hospitals here?</p>
<p>It makes no sense.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s horrifying.</p>
<p>So who&rsquo;s responsible for that?</p>
<p>Like who?</p>
<p>Alex Jones.</p>
<p>No, I meant for, well, so who&rsquo;s responsible</p>
<p>for arriving at the truth of that,</p>
<p>of speaking to the money spent on the wars in Iraq?</p>
<p>This is one of the great things about social media.</p>
<p>Twitter, you have faith in Twitter.</p>
<p>Not specifically Twitter, but yeah,</p>
<p>social media&rsquo;s the whole, what anyone could.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s another great example.</p>
<p>Before, if you were talking about police brutality</p>
<p>or these riots, you would have to perceive it</p>
<p>in the way it was framed and presented to you.</p>
<p>Nicholas Sandman&rsquo;s another example.</p>
<p>Breonna Taylor, all these things.</p>
<p>Well, we don&rsquo;t have footage of her.</p>
<p>You would have to perceive in the way that it&rsquo;s edited</p>
<p>and presented to you by the corporate press.</p>
<p>Now everyone is a video, has a video camera.</p>
<p>Everyone has their perspective.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s very useful when these incidents happen</p>
<p>where you could see the same incident from several angles</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t need Don Lemon or Chris Wallace</p>
<p>to tell me what this means.</p>
<p>I can see with my own eyes.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;ve been very pleasantly surprised about the power.</p>
<p>See, the mob, again, gets in the way.</p>
<p>They get emotional and they destroy the ability</p>
<p>for people to reason.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re right that truth is unobstructed on social media.</p>
<p>Like if you&rsquo;re careful and patient, you can see the truth.</p>
<p>Like for example, data on COVID,</p>
<p>some of the best sources are doctors.</p>
<p>Like if you wanna know the truth about the coronavirus</p>
<p>and what&rsquo;s happening is there&rsquo;s follow people on Twitter.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s certain people that are just like sourcing them</p>
<p>from me versus the CDC and the WHO.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s fast.</p>
<p>I mean, well, it&rsquo;s kind of anarchy, right?</p>
<p>Yes, it is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not kind of, it is anarchy, yes.</p>
<p>I mean, well, there&rsquo;s some censorship</p>
<p>and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>You have censorship under anarchy</p>
<p>in the sense that you&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>Like people get kicked off of Twitter.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a drawing backwards.</p>
<p>How do you kick somebody, okay.</p>
<p>So, I mean, it&rsquo;s a.</p>
<p>Private company.</p>
<p>Most people wouldn&rsquo;t say Twitter is working,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s probably because they take for granted</p>
<p>how well it&rsquo;s working and they&rsquo;re just complaining</p>
<p>about the small part of it that&rsquo;s broken.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay, another question about.</p>
<p>You feel better?</p>
<p>No, by the way, I mean, I had a personal gripe</p>
<p>with the situation about the, not a personal gripe,</p>
<p>but I felt overly emotional about the possibility</p>
<p>that there will be some of Donald Trump</p>
<p>messing with the election process,</p>
<p>but you made me feel better.</p>
<p>Good.</p>
<p>Like saying like, if he had a bunch of opportunities</p>
<p>to do what I would have done if I was a dictator,</p>
<p>I would, the first time those riots over George Floyd,</p>
<p>I would have instituted martial law.</p>
<p>Do you know what I remember very vividly?</p>
<p>Is after 9 11 and everyone was waiting for George Bush</p>
<p>to give his speech and he had 98% approved rating.</p>
<p>And I remember very vividly,</p>
<p>cause if he had said we&rsquo;re suspending the constitution,</p>
<p>everyone would have cheered for him.</p>
<p>Like he couldn&rsquo;t get enough support at that time.</p>
<p>And he didn&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>And I can&rsquo;t say anything really good about George W. Bush.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a fan of his to say the least.</p>
<p>So I think you and I, and other people who are familiar</p>
<p>with totalitarian regimes to some extent from our ancestry</p>
<p>or whatever, from research should always be the ones</p>
<p>freaking out and warning,</p>
<p>but we should also be aware of we got a ways to go</p>
<p>before it&rsquo;s Hitler.</p>
<p>And thankfully there are a lot of dominoes</p>
<p>that have to fall into place before Hitler.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the game secret Hitler, it&rsquo;s a board game</p>
<p>before Hitler becomes Hitler.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s not, especially in America,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s lots of things that have to happen</p>
<p>before you really get to that point.</p>
<p>I mean, FDR was for all intents and purposes a dictator,</p>
<p>but even then the worst you could say,</p>
<p>and this is not something that you should take lightly</p>
<p>was internment of Japanese citizens,</p>
<p>but they weren&rsquo;t murdered.</p>
<p>They weren&rsquo;t under lock and key in the sense of like in cells.</p>
<p>So things could have gotten a lot worse for him.</p>
<p>We have to, I mean, Hitler is such a horrible person</p>
<p>to bring up because.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s Mussolini.</p>
<p>Yeah, Mussolini is better because Hitler is so close</p>
<p>and connected to the atrocities of the Holocaust.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s all this stuff that led up to the war</p>
<p>and the war itself.</p>
<p>Say that there was no Holocaust,</p>
<p>Hitler would probably be viewed differently.</p>
<p>Yes, I should think so.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, but.</p>
<p>You think, that&rsquo;s a very controversial stance.</p>
<p>You think Hitler would be viewed differently</p>
<p>if it wasn&rsquo;t for the Holocaust?</p>
<p>Well, I mean, but it&rsquo;s a funny thing that the,</p>
<p>I would say the death of how many, 40, 50 million.</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t know how you calculate it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not seen as bad as the 6 million.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, because of Mao and Stalin.</p>
<p>Yeah, but it&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m working on it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re working on it.</p>
<p>Yeah, the next book I&rsquo;m talking about.</p>
<p>Reminding, well, it&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad a good writer is,</p>
<p>because the world&rsquo;s not reminded.</p>
<p>My last book, The New Right,</p>
<p>I had to deal with something like the Nazis.</p>
<p>And one of the points they make is,</p>
<p>how come everyone knows about the Holocaust,</p>
<p>but no one knows about the Holodomor?</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>We should know about this,</p>
<p>because it is a great example of both</p>
<p>how the Western media were depraved,</p>
<p>but also what human beings are capable of.</p>
<p>And those scars are still,</p>
<p>many Americans think Russia and Ukraine are the same thing.</p>
<p>Oh, Trump&rsquo;s in bed with the Ukrainians,</p>
<p>Trump&rsquo;s about the Russians,</p>
<p>they think it&rsquo;s the same thing.</p>
<p>For us, it&rsquo;s complete lunacy.</p>
<p>But this is the kind of thing where Pol Pot</p>
<p>is another example,</p>
<p>where people have no clue of what has been done</p>
<p>to their fellow man on the face of this earth,</p>
<p>and they should know.</p>
<p>How much of that do you lay at the hands of communism?</p>
<p>How much are you with like a Jordan Pearson</p>
<p>who is intricately connecting the atrocities,</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;re saying, 1930s Ukraine,</p>
<p>where people were starved?</p>
<p>I recently, my grandmother recently passed away,</p>
<p>and she survived that as a kid.</p>
<p>Which is, those people, I mean, they&rsquo;re tough.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re tough.</p>
<p>Like that whole region is tough,</p>
<p>because they survived that,</p>
<p>and then right after, occupation of Nazis, of Germans.</p>
<p>How much do you lay that at communism as an ideology,</p>
<p>versus Stalin, the man?</p>
<p>I think Lenin was building concentration camps</p>
<p>while he was around, and slave labor.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t, I think it&rsquo;s clearly both.</p>
<p>There are certain variants of communism</p>
<p>that were far, like Khrushchev and Gorbachev,</p>
<p>the reason the Soviet Union fell apart,</p>
<p>and this is kind of, I&rsquo;m gonna spoil the end of the book.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an amazing book called Revolution 1989,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like the most beautiful book I&rsquo;ve ever read,</p>
<p>by Viktor Sebastian, he&rsquo;s a Hungarian author.</p>
<p>And basically what happens in 1989,</p>
<p>Poland has their elections,</p>
<p>and then in 1990, they kind of let in</p>
<p>the labor people to the government.</p>
<p>And people start crossing borders in the Eastern Bloc,</p>
<p>and you had Hanukkah from Eastern Germany,</p>
<p>and Ceausescu from Romania calling Gorbachev,</p>
<p>because those are the two toughest ones,</p>
<p>by communist standards, they go,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re just escaping, we&rsquo;re gonna lose everything.</p>
<p>You gotta send in the tanks, like you did in Hungary,</p>
<p>like you did in Czechoslovakia in 68.</p>
<p>And Gorbachev goes, I&rsquo;m not sending the tanks.</p>
<p>And they go, dude, if you don&rsquo;t send in the tanks,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all done, and he goes, nope, I&rsquo;m not that kind of guy.</p>
<p>And they were right, Ceausescu was personally shot</p>
<p>with his wife up against the wall,</p>
<p>Hanukkah, I forget what happened to him,</p>
<p>but they all self liberated.</p>
<p>My friend who was born in Czechoslovakia,</p>
<p>his mom was pregnant under communism,</p>
<p>and she never even imagined he&rsquo;d be free,</p>
<p>and he was born under free.</p>
<p>And they were all looking around,</p>
<p>all these countries that self liberated,</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re like, this is a trick, right?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re trying to figure out who&rsquo;s like not good,</p>
<p>so that they can arrest us on mass, and they didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>So even within communism,</p>
<p>there are bad guys and better guys.</p>
<p>But we talked about anarchy, we talked about democracy.</p>
<p>Do you see, like there&rsquo;s democratic socialism</p>
<p>conversations going on in the popular culture,</p>
<p>socialism is seen as like evil, or for some people, great?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts about it as in a political ideology?</p>
<p>Evil.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re on the evil side?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Fundamentally?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>What is it, you know, what makes it evil?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s like structurally, if you were to try to analyze?</p>
<p>Sure, I&rsquo;d say three ways.</p>
<p>Morally, no person has the right</p>
<p>to tell another person how to live their life.</p>
<p>Economically, it&rsquo;s not possible</p>
<p>to make calculations under socialism.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s only the prices that are information that tells me,</p>
<p>oh, this is, we need to produce more of this,</p>
<p>we need to produce less of this.</p>
<p>Without prices being able to adjust</p>
<p>and give information to producers and consumers,</p>
<p>you have no way of being able to produce</p>
<p>effectively or efficiently.</p>
<p>And also it is, it turns people against each other.</p>
<p>When you force people to interact,</p>
<p>when you force them into relationships,</p>
<p>when you force them into jobs,</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t give them any choice,</p>
<p>when there&rsquo;s a monopoly, the consequence of monopoly,</p>
<p>everyone&rsquo;s familiar with ostensibly under capitalism,</p>
<p>but somehow when it&rsquo;s a government monopoly,</p>
<p>all those economic principles don&rsquo;t work,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t make any sense.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s force in democracy too,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just you&rsquo;re saying there&rsquo;s a bit more force</p>
<p>in socialism.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s interesting that you say</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s not enough information.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s ultimately,</p>
<p>you need to have really good data</p>
<p>to achieve the goals of the system,</p>
<p>even if there&rsquo;s no corruption.</p>
<p>You just need to have the information.</p>
<p>Which you can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And capitalism provides you</p>
<p>a really strong source of real time information.</p>
<p>And if capitalism at its best and cleanest,</p>
<p>which is perfect information, is available,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no manipulation of information.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one of the problems, okay.</p>
<p>Can we talk about some candidates,</p>
<p>the ones we got and possible alternatives?</p>
<p>So one question I have is, why do we have,</p>
<p>within this system, why do we have the candidates we have?</p>
<p>It seems, maybe you can correct me,</p>
<p>highly unsatisfactory.</p>
<p>Is anyone actually excited about our current candidates?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m kind of excited,</p>
<p>because no matter who wins the election,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna be hilarious.</p>
<p>So that is something that I&rsquo;m excited about.</p>
<p>From a humor perspective.</p>
<p>Is that what the whole system is?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s one theory of the case,</p>
<p>is the entire thing is optimized for viewership.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And excitement by definitions</p>
<p>of like the reality show kind of excitement.</p>
<p>I think it is,</p>
<p>if you look at what happened with Brett Kavanaugh,</p>
<p>this is not a career that would draw people</p>
<p>who are, you might say, quality.</p>
<p>Because no matter who they are,</p>
<p>there would be a huge incentive from the other team</p>
<p>to denigrate them and humiliate them</p>
<p>in the worst possible ways.</p>
<p>Because as the two teams lose their legitimacy</p>
<p>among Gen Pop, it&rsquo;s gonna get harder and harder</p>
<p>for them to maintain any kind of claims to authority,</p>
<p>which is something I like,</p>
<p>but which does kind of play out</p>
<p>in certain nefarious ways.</p>
<p>So people, the best of the best,</p>
<p>are not gonna wanna be politicians.</p>
<p>Yeah, because I could have a job,</p>
<p>or have a job interview and I&rsquo;m running Yahoo or whatever,</p>
<p>or I could, for 18 months, have to eat, you know,</p>
<p>corn dogs looking like I&rsquo;m going down on someone</p>
<p>and shake hands and have all this,</p>
<p>my family and on social media daily</p>
<p>called the worst things, for what?</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;m still not guaranteed the position.</p>
<p>But the flip side of that, like from my perspective,</p>
<p>is the competition is weak.</p>
<p>Meaning, like, you need a minimum amount of eloquence,</p>
<p>eloquence, clearly, that I don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>the bar which I did not pass.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think either of them would be considered</p>
<p>particularly eloquent, Biden or Trump.</p>
<p>No, I know, but that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m saying.</p>
<p>The competition, like if you were,</p>
<p>wanted to become a politician,</p>
<p>if you wanted to run for president,</p>
<p>the opportunity is there.</p>
<p>Like if you were at all competent.</p>
<p>Like if you had, so like Andrew Yang is an example</p>
<p>of somebody who has a bunch of ideas,</p>
<p>is somewhat eloquent, like young, energetic.</p>
<p>It feels like there should be thousands of Andrew Yangs,</p>
<p>like that would enter the domain.</p>
<p>He went nowhere.</p>
<p>Well, I wouldn&rsquo;t say he went nowhere.</p>
<p>He generated quite a bit of excitement.</p>
<p>He just didn&rsquo;t go very far, that&rsquo;s, okay.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to run for president</p>
<p>to generate excitement with your ideas.</p>
<p>You could be a podcast host, I&rsquo;m not even joking.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right, that&rsquo;s right, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s both, Andrew Yang.</p>
<p>Oh, he&rsquo;s a podcast?</p>
<p>Yeah, he has a podcast called Yang Speaks.</p>
<p>Oh, okay, cool.</p>
<p>Oh, wow, the music of the way you said, yeah, cool.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the way my mom talks to me</p>
<p>when I tell her something exciting going on in my life.</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s nice, honey.</p>
<p>Oh, you made a robot, that&rsquo;s cool.</p>
<p>A mixed coffee?</p>
<p>Oh, you&rsquo;re still single, though, aren&rsquo;t you?</p>
<p>I wonder why, I wonder why.</p>
<p>Make yourself a robot wife?</p>
<p>Give me some robot grandchildren.</p>
<p>Okay, but first of all, okay,</p>
<p>let me ask you about Andrew Yang</p>
<p>because he represents fresh energy.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t find him fresh or energetic, you know?</p>
<p>Like, is there any candidate you wish was in the mix</p>
<p>that was in the mix you wish was</p>
<p>one of the last two remaining?</p>
<p>Yeah, people like Marianne Williamson, I thought was great.</p>
<p>Tulsi, I thought was great.</p>
<p>Amy Klobuchar got a bad rap.</p>
<p>I think she held her own.</p>
<p>Smart, she wasn&rsquo;t particularly funny, that&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>I think she was nonthreatening to a lot of people.</p>
<p>What did you like about them?</p>
<p>I guess I just named all women, that&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t even intentional.</p>
<p>Tulsi, I liked that she was aggressive,</p>
<p>has a good resume and is not staying the course</p>
<p>for the establishment.</p>
<p>Marianne Williamson, I like because she comes from a place,</p>
<p>from what it seems, of genuine compassion.</p>
<p>Maybe she&rsquo;s a sociopath, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I read her book and it actually affected me profoundly</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s very rare when you read a book</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s even that one idea that blows your mind</p>
<p>and that you kind of think about all the time.</p>
<p>And there was one such idea in her book</p>
<p>about she was teaching something called A Course</p>
<p>in Miracles in Hollywood.</p>
<p>I think she still teaches it.</p>
<p>And this was during the 80s, the height of the AIDS crisis.</p>
<p>And all these young men in the prime of their life</p>
<p>were dropping like flies.</p>
<p>And she&rsquo;s trying to give them hope.</p>
<p>Well, good luck, they&rsquo;re dying, no one cares.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re like, you can&rsquo;t tell us</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re gonna cure this, that&rsquo;s a lie.</p>
<p>And she goes, what if I told you they&rsquo;re not gonna cure it?</p>
<p>What if I told you it&rsquo;s gonna be to like diabetes?</p>
<p>They cut off your foot and you&rsquo;re gonna go blind.</p>
<p>Would that be something that you can hope for?</p>
<p>And when you put it like that, it&rsquo;s like, yeah.</p>
<p>Like if you&rsquo;re talking to someone like a homeless junkie</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re like, you could be a doctor,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re a lawyer or a lawyer, like cool story.</p>
<p>Like you could have a studio apartment</p>
<p>with a terrible roommate and a shitty job.</p>
<p>But when you&rsquo;re on the street,</p>
<p>cooking breakfast in a teaspoon and you hear that,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re like, wait, would that really be so bad?</p>
<p>Is that really so much worse than this?</p>
<p>No, and it becomes something.</p>
<p>So when she put it in those terms, I&rsquo;m like, wow,</p>
<p>this woman that really did a number on me</p>
<p>in terms of teaching people how to be hopeful.</p>
<p>Small steps, I guess.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s also, then it becomes less of I need a miracle</p>
<p>to be like, oh, this is really manageable.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s absurd to think it&rsquo;s impossible.</p>
<p>What about what&rsquo;s your take on Unity 2020</p>
<p>that Brett Weinstein pushed forward?</p>
<p>It was DOA, he couldn&rsquo;t even stand up to Twitter.</p>
<p>Dead on arrival.</p>
<p>He couldn&rsquo;t even stand up to Twitter, let alone,</p>
<p>or to Facebook, they got blocked,</p>
<p>let alone to Facebook.</p>
<p>It was not hugely problematic, by the way,</p>
<p>that Twitter would block that.</p>
<p>Not at all.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why they blocked it,</p>
<p>but I believe, I don&rsquo;t know what problematic means.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a word that does a lot of work</p>
<p>that people wanted to do conceptually.</p>
<p>The idea that Unity is taking the rejects from each party</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re gonna have something that no one likes</p>
<p>and therefore it&rsquo;s gonna be a compromise is absurd.</p>
<p>The last time we had this kind of Unity ticket</p>
<p>was the Civil War, where you had Andrew Johnson</p>
<p>from the Democrats and Lincoln from the Republicans.</p>
<p>This was not something that ended well,</p>
<p>particularly nicely, for both halves of the country.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the way you see it is,</p>
<p>like the way I saw it,</p>
<p>I guess I haven&rsquo;t looked carefully at it.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t either, to be fair.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>The way I saw it is emphasizing centrists, which is.</p>
<p>How is Tulsi a centrist?</p>
<p>Tulsi was involved?</p>
<p>Yes, he&rsquo;s trying to push Tulsi</p>
<p>on like Jesse Ventura or something.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>So, okay, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know the specifics.</p>
<p>As a scientist, you also know centrism</p>
<p>is not a coherent term in politics.</p>
<p>But see, now you&rsquo;re like, what is it?</p>
<p>Pleading to authority and my ego.</p>
<p>No, no, I&rsquo;m pleading to how you approach data.</p>
<p>If someone is saying the mean is accurate,</p>
<p>that only mean, I mean, the mean could be anywhere.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a function of what&rsquo;s around it.</p>
<p>That mean is true.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even know what centrists is supposed to mean,</p>
<p>but what it means to me, there&rsquo;s no idea, a centrist.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s more of a center right or center left.</p>
<p>To me, what that means is somebody</p>
<p>who is a liberal or a conservative,</p>
<p>but is open minded and empathetic to the other side.</p>
<p>Joe Biden had the crime bill.</p>
<p>Joe Biden voted for Republican Supreme Court justices.</p>
<p>Joe Biden voted for a balanced budget.</p>
<p>Joe Biden voted for Bush&rsquo;s war.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m sure probably I haven&rsquo;t looked this up,</p>
<p>the Patriot Act.</p>
<p>Joe, if you want a centrist, you have Joe Biden.</p>
<p>Yeah, okay.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s worked very well with Republicans.</p>
<p>That argument could be made.</p>
<p>Of course, everybody will always resist that argument.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s indeniable.</p>
<p>In fact, during the campaign,</p>
<p>some activists started yelling at him at a town hall.</p>
<p>Not yelling, just saying, hey, we need open borders.</p>
<p>Joe Biden says, I&rsquo;m not for open borders.</p>
<p>Go vote for Trump and literally turn his back on the man.</p>
<p>And this is during the primaries</p>
<p>where it would behoove you to try to appeal to the base.</p>
<p>And of course, you can probably also make the argument</p>
<p>that Donald Trump is center right, if not center left.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, he&rsquo;s very unique as a personality.</p>
<p>But if you look at his record,</p>
<p>and first of all, his rhetoric,</p>
<p>you can say is not centrist at all.</p>
<p>But in terms of how he governs,</p>
<p>the budgeting, I mean, has been very moderate.</p>
<p>It certainly hasn&rsquo;t been like draconian budget cuts.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court, you could say, okay, he&rsquo;s hard right.</p>
<p>Immigration, you could say in certain capacities,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s hard right.</p>
<p>But in terms of pro life, what has he done there?</p>
<p>In terms of, so in many other aspects,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s been very much this kind of me too Republican.</p>
<p>But certainly the rhetoric,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very hard to make him the case that he&rsquo;s a centrist.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t like,</p>
<p>is there any other idea you find compelling?</p>
<p>What I like about UND 2020 is it&rsquo;s an idea</p>
<p>for a different way, for like a different party,</p>
<p>a different path forward.</p>
<p>So ideas, just like anarchy is an interesting idea</p>
<p>that leads to discourse, that leads to.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s interesting at all.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s why I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>Sweden has eight parties in its parliament.</p>
<p>Iceland, population is like 150,000.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve got nine, I think it was.</p>
<p>Czech Republic has nine, Britain has five.</p>
<p>So the claim that two parties</p>
<p>is the censorious of speech,</p>
<p>but three, oh, now all of a sudden,</p>
<p>it makes no sense, doesn&rsquo;t port to the data, number one.</p>
<p>Number two is Donald Trump demonstrated</p>
<p>that you can be basically a third party candidate,</p>
<p>sees the machinery of a existing party</p>
<p>and appropriate to your own ends as Bernie Sanders.</p>
<p>Bernie Sanders has never been a Democrat.</p>
<p>Major credit to him for that&rsquo;s not easy</p>
<p>to be elected as Senator as an independent.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s done it repeatedly.</p>
<p>So these are two examples of ossified elites</p>
<p>right for the picking.</p>
<p>But to have a third party makes no real sense.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, a party you talk about quite a bit.</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s look, this is a personal challenge to you.</p>
<p>Let me bring up the Libertarian Party.</p>
<p>And the personal challenge is to go five minutes</p>
<p>without mocking them in discussing this idea.</p>
<p>So first of all, what?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m being trolled.</p>
<p>Okay, I&rsquo;m being trolled, okay, I&rsquo;m being trolled.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m being trolled, okay, this is good.</p>
<p>Do you remember the fun friends?</p>
<p>There was an episode where Chandler</p>
<p>had to not make fun of people.</p>
<p>Like, can you go one day Chandler?</p>
<p>And Phoebe starts telling him about like this UFO she saw</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s like, that&rsquo;s very interesting and nice for you.</p>
<p>This is exactly that.</p>
<p>So a true master would be able to play</p>
<p>within the game, within the constraints.</p>
<p>So no, I&rsquo;m pretty sure you&rsquo;ll still mock them.</p>
<p>But no, no, I&rsquo;ll stick to the rules.</p>
<p>Five minutes, easy.</p>
<p>So first of all, speaking broadly about libertarianism,</p>
<p>can you speak to that, how you feel about it?</p>
<p>And then also to the Libertarian Party,</p>
<p>which is the implementation of it in our current system.</p>
<p>So I think libertarianism is a great idea.</p>
<p>And I think there&rsquo;s many libertarian ideas</p>
<p>that have become much more mainstream,</p>
<p>which I&rsquo;m very, very happy about.</p>
<p>I remember there was an article in either New York</p>
<p>or New Yorker Magazine in the early 90s,</p>
<p>where they talked about the Cato Institute,</p>
<p>which is a libertarian think tank.</p>
<p>And they refer to the fact that Cato was against war</p>
<p>and against like regulation with a wacky consistency,</p>
<p>because they didn&rsquo;t know how to reconcile these two things.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t remember what the two things were,</p>
<p>but I remember that expression wacky consistency.</p>
<p>And it wasn&rsquo;t even, we were all taught,</p>
<p>and this is very much before the internet,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s two tribes and if you&rsquo;re pro life,</p>
<p>you have to hate gays.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re for socialized medicine,</p>
<p>that also means you have to be for free speech.</p>
<p>It was just this very, and like there&rsquo;s a whole menu</p>
<p>and you got to sign it to all of them.</p>
<p>And that menu is terrible.</p>
<p>They hate America, they want to destroy it.</p>
<p>Oh my God, those are horrible evil.</p>
<p>This is the menu you want.</p>
<p>And the Libertarian Party to some extent,</p>
<p>and just libertarians as a whole said,</p>
<p>you know, you can do the Chinese buffet</p>
<p>and take a little from column A, a little from column B</p>
<p>and have an ideology that is coherent and consistent,</p>
<p>an ideology of peace and nonaggression</p>
<p>and things like that.</p>
<p>The Libertarian Party takes its model</p>
<p>from like the early progressive and populist parties</p>
<p>from the early 20th century,</p>
<p>which were not very effective</p>
<p>in terms of getting people elected,</p>
<p>but were extremely effective</p>
<p>in terms of getting the two major parties</p>
<p>to appropriate and adopt their ideas and implement them.</p>
<p>And in Britain as well, the liberal party got destroyed</p>
<p>and became taken over by labor</p>
<p>as the alternative party to the Tories</p>
<p>and have those ideas basically become mainstreamed.</p>
<p>So I think that, and the libertarian,</p>
<p>my friend who passed away, Eric, I miss him dearly,</p>
<p>was their webmaster and his whole point is,</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t think of that in terms of a party,</p>
<p>in terms of getting people elected,</p>
<p>but if you think of it as a party</p>
<p>in terms of getting people educated about alternatives,</p>
<p>then there&rsquo;s enormous use for that.</p>
<p>That was his perspective.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s an absurd perspective.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s some libertarian ideas</p>
<p>that have become extremely mainstream.</p>
<p>War should be a last resort.</p>
<p>This is something we were taught as kids and we all say,</p>
<p>but for many years, it&rsquo;s been like,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t think of it as a last resort.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like something&rsquo;s bad, well, it&rsquo;s like the first instinct.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s like, let&rsquo;s really give it a week, just a week.</p>
<p>Like what&rsquo;s going on in Syria?</p>
<p>Is there really gonna be a genocide, the Kurds?</p>
<p>You know, things like that.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s one.</p>
<p>Another thing is drug legalization.</p>
<p>This was, you know, when you and I were kids,</p>
<p>oh, it&rsquo;s crazy.</p>
<p>Only hippies wanna smoke pot.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s like, I was on a grand jury.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll point out what people make is,</p>
<p>are you sure that the 16 year old who&rsquo;s selling weed,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say selling, should his life be ruined?</p>
<p>Should he be imprisoned with rapists and murderers?</p>
<p>Like if you say yes, say yes,</p>
<p>but you have to acknowledge that that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re meaning.</p>
<p>And then a lot of people are like, wait a minute,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s gotta be a third option</p>
<p>then he has no consequences or he&rsquo;s imprisoned</p>
<p>with a rapist.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not comfortable with either of these.</p>
<p>And I think the other one is an increasing skepticism.</p>
<p>This libertarians were on top of this first</p>
<p>and the hard left of the police.</p>
<p>As of now, asset forfeiture steals more from people</p>
<p>than burglaries.</p>
<p>What people don&rsquo;t know about what asset forfeiture is,</p>
<p>if the cops come to your house and they suspect you,</p>
<p>you haven&rsquo;t been convicted of using your car or your house</p>
<p>or whatever in terms of selling drugs,</p>
<p>they can take whatever they want.</p>
<p>And then you have to sue to prove your innocence</p>
<p>and get your property back.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a complete violation of due process.</p>
<p>People don&rsquo;t realize it&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a great way for the cops to increase their budgets</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s legal.</p>
<p>And libertarians were like the first big ones saying,</p>
<p>guys, this is not American and this is crazy.</p>
<p>And now increasingly people on conservatives and leftists</p>
<p>like, wait a minute, this is&hellip;</p>
<p>Even if you are selling drugs, like they take your house,</p>
<p>what are you talking about?</p>
<p>So I think those are some mechanisms that libertarianism,</p>
<p>though not by name, has become far more popular.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s interesting, so the idea, yeah, a coherent set</p>
<p>of ideas that eventually get integrated</p>
<p>into a two party system.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>The war, that&rsquo;s an interesting one.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>I wonder what the thread there is.</p>
<p>I wonder how it connects to 9 11 and so on.</p>
<p>I think the Patriot Act.</p>
<p>Patriot Act, okay.</p>
<p>For people who are politically savvy,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re like, oh, okay, this is not a joke.</p>
<p>This is really a crazy infringement of our freedoms</p>
<p>and both parties are falling over each other</p>
<p>to sign into law and the Orwellian name.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t wanna&hellip;</p>
<p>How can you be against patriotism?</p>
<p>What kind of person?</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>So I think for a lot of people,</p>
<p>especially both civil libertarians on the left</p>
<p>and a lot of conservatives who are constitutionalists</p>
<p>are like, wait a minute, this isn&rsquo;t&hellip;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not comfortable with this.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m also not comfortable with how comfortable everyone</p>
<p>in Washington is with it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re right, probably libertarians</p>
<p>and libertarianism is a place of ideas,</p>
<p>which is why I have a connection to it.</p>
<p>Every time I listen to those folks, I like them.</p>
<p>I feel connected to them.</p>
<p>I would even sometimes, depending on the day,</p>
<p>call myself a libertarian.</p>
<p>Well, we&rsquo;re all the spectrum, so that&rsquo;s why.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re all on the spectrum, yeah.</p>
<p>But when I look at the people that actually rise to the top</p>
<p>in terms of the people who represent the party,</p>
<p>this is where five minutes ran out, right?</p>
<p>I could go, I&rsquo;m allowed.</p>
<p>You can go, why are they so weird?</p>
<p>Why aren&rsquo;t strong candidates emerging</p>
<p>that represent as political representatives</p>
<p>or as famous speakers that represent ideology?</p>
<p>I think libertarians tend to&hellip;</p>
<p>I think Jonathan Haidt in his book, in his research,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a political scientist and he does a lot of things</p>
<p>about how people come to their political inclusions</p>
<p>and what factors force people to reach conclusions.</p>
<p>And he found that libertarians are the least empathetic</p>
<p>and most rationalistic of all the groups.</p>
<p>And by that, he means like they think in terms of logic</p>
<p>as opposed to like people&rsquo;s feelings</p>
<p>and that has positives and has negatives.</p>
<p>And we have the A, B testing with Ron Paul.</p>
<p>Ron Paul ran for president as a libertarian nominee.</p>
<p>He was the nominee.</p>
<p>He got pretty much nowhere in 1988.</p>
<p>Then he ran as a return to the Republican party</p>
<p>as a congressman for many years from Texas.</p>
<p>He ran for the presidency in 2008 and 2012.</p>
<p>And in 2008, he stood on stage with Rudy Giuliani</p>
<p>and told him that they were here in 9 11</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re over there,</p>
<p>which would have been a shocking, horrifying taboo</p>
<p>a few years earlier.</p>
<p>Many people were like, holy crap, this is amazing.</p>
<p>Giuliani was all offended and Ron Paul&rsquo;s like&hellip;</p>
<p>I took some guts by the way.</p>
<p>Yeah, you did.</p>
<p>When I heard that, it was so refreshing.</p>
<p>Not what he said, but the fact that he said something</p>
<p>that took guts.</p>
<p>It made me realize how rare it is for politicians,</p>
<p>but even people to say something that takes guts.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s also the idea that like you can&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>even if you think America has a right</p>
<p>to invade any country on earth as much as it wants</p>
<p>and kill people as a consequence of war</p>
<p>and blow up their buildings and destroy their country,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t with a straight face</p>
<p>not expect us to have consequences,</p>
<p>even if they&rsquo;re consequences from evil people.</p>
<p>Even if we&rsquo;re 100% of the good guys</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re 100% of the bad guys,</p>
<p>those bad guys, some of them are still gonna try</p>
<p>to do something.</p>
<p>What happens next?</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>So that kind of concept that there&rsquo;s any American</p>
<p>culpability, we&rsquo;re America, we are the good guys</p>
<p>by definition, we&rsquo;re not culpable,</p>
<p>to have people start thinking about</p>
<p>what if there&rsquo;s another way?</p>
<p>You know, what if we&rsquo;re not there</p>
<p>and then they&rsquo;re not here</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re kind of doing a backdoor,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re talking so different scenarios.</p>
<p>So the fact that he got so much more traction</p>
<p>as a Republican, the fact that Donald Trump</p>
<p>who came out of nowhere became not only the candidate,</p>
<p>but the president tells people,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like getting a book deal, right?</p>
<p>You can either go, there&rsquo;s three choices.</p>
<p>You can either self publish, mainstream publisher</p>
<p>or independent publisher.</p>
<p>The independent publisher is the worst of all choices</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re not getting a big advance,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not gonna be able to promote you a lot</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t get the distribution.</p>
<p>Mainstream, I&rsquo;ve done mainstream and self, right?</p>
<p>With self, I don&rsquo;t have the cred,</p>
<p>the respectability of a mainstream or the cache.</p>
<p>It can be a New York Times bestseller.</p>
<p>Right, it takes a lot of work,</p>
<p>but I get a lot more of the profit.</p>
<p>If it looks good on the shelf on Amazon,</p>
<p>it looks identical, so on and so forth.</p>
<p>With the mainstream, the benefits and costs</p>
<p>are pretty much obvious to most people.</p>
<p>So the same thing, it&rsquo;s like you can either</p>
<p>be an independent like Ross Perot</p>
<p>or you could be, just seize one of the party apparatus,</p>
<p>which the benefits are enormous there.</p>
<p>But in terms of going third party,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know the libertarian party apparatus</p>
<p>other than maybe some ballot access</p>
<p>is really that efficacious.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;re gonna have a lot of baggage.</p>
<p>Cause if you hear independent, Jesse Ventura, Ross Perot,</p>
<p>you think of the person.</p>
<p>Now you have to define yourself</p>
<p>and you have to defend the party.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s two bridges for most people.</p>
<p>So, brilliantly put, okay, let me speak to you.</p>
<p>Cause I&rsquo;m speaking to Yaron Brooks soon.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I like him.</p>
<p>Yeah, so, but that, another example, I was.</p>
<p>Ask him to tell you a joke about Ayn Rand,</p>
<p>if he can do it.</p>
<p>So there, that&rsquo;s one criticism I&rsquo;ve heard you say,</p>
<p>which is they&rsquo;re unable to speak to any weaknesses</p>
<p>in either Ayn Rand&rsquo;s or objectivist worldview.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really, well, you put it,</p>
<p>I know you&rsquo;re half joking,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s actually a legitimate discussion to have.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not joking at all.</p>
<p>Because that&rsquo;s, to me, one of the criticisms</p>
<p>and one of the explanations why the world</p>
<p>seems to disrespect Ayn Rand, the people that do,</p>
<p>is she kind of implies that her ideas are like flawless.</p>
<p>No, she says they correspond to reality.</p>
<p>Yeah, right.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the term she uses.</p>
<p>That, I mean, objectivist, it&rsquo;s in the name.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, you know, it&rsquo;s just facts.</p>
<p>Like, it&rsquo;s impossible to basically argue against</p>
<p>cause it&rsquo;s pretty simple, it&rsquo;s just all facts.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s possible to argue against,</p>
<p>but she would say she&rsquo;s never met a good critic</p>
<p>who can argue the facts out of misrepresentation.</p>
<p>And she&rsquo;s not entirely wrong.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s often caricatured,</p>
<p>cause she has a very extreme personality</p>
<p>and extreme worldview.</p>
<p>But that to me, I mean, some people,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a guy named in the physics mathematics community</p>
<p>called Stephen Wolfram.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ve heard of him.</p>
<p>Wolfram Malfoy?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>He has a similar style of speaking sometimes,</p>
<p>which is like, I&rsquo;ve created a science,</p>
<p>but that turns a lot of people off,</p>
<p>like this kind of weird confidence.</p>
<p>But he&rsquo;s one of my favorite people,</p>
<p>I think one of the most brilliant people.</p>
<p>If you just ignore that little bit of ego</p>
<p>or whatever you call that,</p>
<p>that there are some beautiful ideas in there.</p>
<p>And that, for me, objectivism,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m undereducated about it.</p>
<p>I hope to be more educated,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s some interesting ideas that,</p>
<p>again, just like with UFOs,</p>
<p>not that there&rsquo;s a connection between the two.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t bring that up for your own.</p>
<p>He won&rsquo;t like it.</p>
<p>He won&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>My friends like UFOs.</p>
<p>Oh, no, no, no, this interview is over.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good yarn.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>But you know, you have to be a little bit open minded,</p>
<p>but what&rsquo;s your sense of objectivism?</p>
<p>Are there interesting ideas</p>
<p>that are useful to you to think about?</p>
<p>I own her copy of the first printing of The Fountainhead.</p>
<p>So that should tell you a little bit</p>
<p>about how my affection for Ms. Rand,</p>
<p>how heavy that goes.</p>
<p>Ayn Rand does not have all the answers,</p>
<p>but she has all the questions.</p>
<p>So if you study Rand,</p>
<p>you are going to be forced to think through</p>
<p>some very basic things,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re gonna have your eyes open very, very heavily.</p>
<p>She was not perfect.</p>
<p>She never claimed to be perfect.</p>
<p>She was asked on Donahue,</p>
<p>is it true that according to your philosophy,</p>
<p>you are a perfect being?</p>
<p>She said, I never think of myself that way.</p>
<p>And she said, but if you asked me,</p>
<p>do I practice what I preach?</p>
<p>The answer is yes, resoundingly.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s a fascinating woman.</p>
<p>What is really interesting about her,</p>
<p>and this is something you&rsquo;d appreciate personally,</p>
<p>is when you read her essays,</p>
<p>she&rsquo;ll have these weird asides.</p>
<p>And it looked like she was talking about art,</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;d be like, and this is why the US</p>
<p>should be the only country with nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>And when you follow a brilliant mind</p>
<p>making these seemingly disparate connections,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s something I find to be just absolutely inspiring</p>
<p>and awesome and entertaining.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s lots of things about her</p>
<p>that people like Yaron would make uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Well, like she, they,</p>
<p>so objectivism, like any other philosophy,</p>
<p>has all these techniques to kind of hand wave away things</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t wanna talk about and like pretend it.</p>
<p>So they talk about things like having</p>
<p>no metaphysical significance, right?</p>
<p>So what that means is like, well, what about this?</p>
<p>Ah, I don&rsquo;t wanna talk about it.</p>
<p>Like it doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>Like it literally means in fancy philosophical terms,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>Or they will say correctly,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s very twisted in our culture</p>
<p>that when we have heroes, we look for their flaws</p>
<p>instead of looking for their virtues.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a hundred percent valid perspective.</p>
<p>However, if I&rsquo;m sitting here telling you</p>
<p>that I think this woman is a badass,</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s amazing and she should be studied,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s also these idiosyncrasies,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t wanna hear it.</p>
<p>Because they, and I think it&rsquo;s very convenient for them</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s a lot of things she did that were,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s an example.</p>
<p>Rand was very, very pro happiness and pleasure.</p>
<p>She was very pro sex, which is kind of surprising</p>
<p>looking at her and how she talked and how strident she was.</p>
<p>As a result of this, she never got her cats fixed</p>
<p>to deny them the pleasure of orgasm.</p>
<p>So her male cats are spraying up her entire house.</p>
<p>Like that is, I mean, that&rsquo;s her putting her philosophy</p>
<p>into practice, but it&rsquo;s still gross.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the kind of thing where I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;d be,</p>
<p>another thing is Rand had an article on a woman president</p>
<p>and she said a woman should never be president, right?</p>
<p>Now, when Rand says things that are too goofy for them,</p>
<p>they say, oh, that&rsquo;s not objectivism,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s her personal preference.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, she did not have these lines.</p>
<p>Objectivism was always defined as Ayn Rand&rsquo;s writings,</p>
<p>plus the additional essays in her books.</p>
<p>So if this was in part of those books,</p>
<p>this counts as official objectivism,</p>
<p>but they pretend otherwise.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s another example.</p>
<p>Plus she was, and I bet you she was on the spectrum</p>
<p>to some extent, I&rsquo;m not joking,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not using that derisively.</p>
<p>She was of the belief and not inaccurately,</p>
<p>because that humor is used to denigrate and humiliate.</p>
<p>And she was thinking about the Jon Stewart type</p>
<p>before there was a Jon Stewart.</p>
<p>And a lot of times, like how I use mocking,</p>
<p>but she was resentful, correctly,</p>
<p>that a lot of times people who are great and accomplished,</p>
<p>little nobodies will make a punchline</p>
<p>just to bring them down and despise her.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an example I just thought of.</p>
<p>I remember when it was, must have been the 90s,</p>
<p>they had a segment on MTV of all these musicians</p>
<p>who were making their own perfumes, right?</p>
<p>And this girl grabbed Prince&rsquo;s perfume,</p>
<p>and before she even smelled it, she had the joke ready.</p>
<p>She goes, oh, this smells almost as bad</p>
<p>as his music lately.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, first of all, I&rsquo;m sure the perfume&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>And second of all, this is Prince.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s one of the all time greats,</p>
<p>and you can&rsquo;t wait to denigrate him.</p>
<p>And part, I wanna be like, how dare you?</p>
<p>Like as if this perfume in any way,</p>
<p>in any way mitigates his amazing accomplishments</p>
<p>and achievements, you horrible person.</p>
<p>But I do have some great Ayn Rand jokes,</p>
<p>and he would not be happy about them.</p>
<p>The perfume thing, the problem with it is just not funny.</p>
<p>Oh, he sucks, okay, great.</p>
<p>Not that they dared to try to be humorous,</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t know why you mentioned John,</p>
<p>because John Stewart can be funny.</p>
<p>Right, but he taught a generation,</p>
<p>you still see this on Twitter,</p>
<p>where things have to be inherently sarcastic and snide.</p>
<p>But isn&rsquo;t that, I mean, aren&rsquo;t you practicing that?</p>
<p>No, I use irony, not sarcasm.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an example.</p>
<p>When people, like you say something,</p>
<p>and someone replied, it&rsquo;d be like,</p>
<p>last I checked, blah, blah, blah, blah,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll say that, I go,</p>
<p>what do you think saying last I checked added to your point?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re giving me valuable information and data,</p>
<p>but you are trained to believe</p>
<p>that it has to be couched in this sneering.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t, just give me the information.</p>
<p>This is useful information.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a knee jerk.</p>
<p>But see, John Stewart did it masterfully.</p>
<p>Correct, and they don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And they don&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s like people who copy comedians,</p>
<p>certain comedians, you try to copy them</p>
<p>and use everything in the process of copying.</p>
<p>Yeah, yep, okay.</p>
<p>But in terms of the philosophy of selfishness,</p>
<p>this kind of individual focused idea,</p>
<p>and I imagine that connects with you.</p>
<p>Yes, and I think it would connect with more people</p>
<p>if they understood what she meant by it.</p>
<p>Nathaniel Brandon, who was her heir</p>
<p>until she kind of broke with him,</p>
<p>and he was a co dedicatee of Atlas Shrugged,</p>
<p>said no one will say Ayn Rand&rsquo;s views with a straight face.</p>
<p>They won&rsquo;t say, I believe that my happiness matters</p>
<p>and is important and is worth fighting for,</p>
<p>and that Ayn Rand says this, then she&rsquo;s dangerous.</p>
<p>Now, it&rsquo;s very easy to say</p>
<p>this could have dangerous consequences</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re a sociopath,</p>
<p>but to put it in those terms, I think is extremely healthy.</p>
<p>I think more people should wanna be happy.</p>
<p>And I think a lot of us are raised to be apologetic,</p>
<p>especially in this cynical media culture,</p>
<p>that if you say, I wanna be happy, I wanna love my life,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s just like, okay, sweetheart.</p>
<p>And the eye rolling,</p>
<p>and I think that&rsquo;s so pernicious and so horrifying,</p>
<p>this is why I&rsquo;m a Camus person,</p>
<p>because Camus thought the archenemy was cynicism</p>
<p>and I could not agree more.</p>
<p>Like if you&rsquo;re the kind of person,</p>
<p>if someone likes a band and you&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>oh, you like them, blah, blah, blah,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, this gives them happiness.</p>
<p>Now, there&rsquo;s certain exceptions,</p>
<p>but if it gives you happiness, it&rsquo;s not for you,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s cool.</p>
<p>Okay, this is beautiful.</p>
<p>I so agree with you on the eye rolling,</p>
<p>but you see the best of trolling as not the eye roll.</p>
<p>Correct, of course not.</p>
<p>The best of trolling is taking down the eye rollers.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna have to think about that.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Because I kind of.</p>
<p>Have another Red Bull.</p>
<p>Yeah, I was, yeah.</p>
<p>Because I put them all.</p>
<p>My blood type is Red Bull.</p>
<p>I kind of put them all in the same bin.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>Okay, all right.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s another example of trolling.</p>
<p>I was making jokes about Ron Paul,</p>
<p>he just had a stroke, right?</p>
<p>And someone came at me and they&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>blah, blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p>You know, you&rsquo;re ugly.</p>
<p>I hope you have a stroke.</p>
<p>I hope you&rsquo;re in the hospital.</p>
<p>And I just go, I just did have a stroke on your mom&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>So they came at me and now they got put in their place.</p>
<p>With a subpar, I mean.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t clever.</p>
<p>You weren&rsquo;t clever.</p>
<p>Not particularly, no.</p>
<p>Well, one of your things you do, which is interesting,</p>
<p>I mean, I give you props in a sense,</p>
<p>is you&rsquo;re willing to go farther than people expect you to.</p>
<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s fun.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>In fact, I&rsquo;ll probably edit out like half of this podcast</p>
<p>because the thing you did, which she kept in,</p>
<p>should mention, is Michaela Peterson now has a podcast,</p>
<p>which is nice.</p>
<p>I guess, was it on her podcast?</p>
<p>She was on mine.</p>
<p>She was on yours.</p>
<p>We did both, but this is when you&rsquo;re referring</p>
<p>to when she was on mine.</p>
<p>She was on, yeah, right.</p>
<p>And you went right for the, for the.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll tell you what it was.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to paraphrase.</p>
<p>I opened up, I say, you know, she&rsquo;s Jordan Peterson&rsquo;s dad.</p>
<p>And as many people know, sorry, he&rsquo;s her dad, yeah.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s had a long issue with substance addiction.</p>
<p>And I said to her, you&rsquo;re most famous</p>
<p>for being Jordan Peterson&rsquo;s daughter.</p>
<p>Many people, he&rsquo;s changed so many lives around the world.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s been such an enormous influence to me personally</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve started taking benzodiazepines recreationally.</p>
<p>And she&rsquo;s like, oh my God, Michael, it&rsquo;s so horrible.</p>
<p>Yeah, because you pulled me in with this,</p>
<p>cause you&rsquo;re talking, I mean, you know,</p>
<p>cause he&rsquo;s going through a rough time.</p>
<p>Now she&rsquo;s going through just everything was just,</p>
<p>you pulled me in emotionally.</p>
<p>I was like, this is going to be the sweet,</p>
<p>Mike is going to be just this wonderful.</p>
<p>And then just bam.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s, that was props to you on that.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t, whatever that is, that is an art form</p>
<p>when done well, it can be taken too far.</p>
<p>My criticism is it, that feels too good for some people.</p>
<p>What do you mean?</p>
<p>Oh, they&rsquo;re too happy being a reverend</p>
<p>cause to show that they don&rsquo;t care about anything.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s another form of cynicism though.</p>
<p>Right, so I, cause you think it&rsquo;s possible to be a troll</p>
<p>and still be the live life to its highest ideal</p>
<p>in the Camus sense.</p>
<p>I try, that&rsquo;s kind of my ideal.</p>
<p>I believe it&rsquo;s not, it becomes a drug.</p>
<p>I feel like that takes you,</p>
<p>like I think love ultimately is the way to experience</p>
<p>like every moment of every day.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t think that was an expression of,</p>
<p>I honestly think, let&rsquo;s split hairs here</p>
<p>cause I think this is something of use here.</p>
<p>I do think that me,</p>
<p>me being able to make her laugh</p>
<p>about this year of hell she was in</p>
<p>does create an element of love</p>
<p>and connection between me and her.</p>
<p>Yeah, but I know she would say that.</p>
<p>Yes, it wasn&rsquo;t that.</p>
<p>It was what you said in combination</p>
<p>with the sweetness everywhere else, the kindness.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very subtle thing,</p>
<p>but like, it&rsquo;s like some of the deepest connection</p>
<p>we have with others is when we like mock them lovingly.</p>
<p>Yes, correct.</p>
<p>But like there is stuff, there&rsquo;s kindness around that.</p>
<p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s not in words,</p>
<p>but in like subtle things.</p>
<p>Cause it creates an air of being familial.</p>
<p>Like we&rsquo;re through this together.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s missing,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s very difficult to do on the internet.</p>
<p>I agree with you.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why my general approach on the internet</p>
<p>is to be more like simple, less witty</p>
<p>and more like dumbly loving.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not your core competency being witty.</p>
<p>Uh, me?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But I can be witty.</p>
<p>You can be, but I&rsquo;m saying that&rsquo;s not your core competency.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying you&rsquo;re bad at it,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m saying that&rsquo;s not where you go like organically,</p>
<p>especially with strangers.</p>
<p>I just feel like nobody&rsquo;s core competence on the internet</p>
<p>is I guess if you want to bring love to the world,</p>
<p>nobody&rsquo;s core competence is given the current platforms,</p>
<p>nobody&rsquo;s core competence is wit.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very difficult to be witty on the internet</p>
<p>without while still communicating kindness.</p>
<p>Like in the same way that you can in physical space.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give you another example.</p>
<p>Someone came at me and they were like,</p>
<p>they gave me a donation.</p>
<p>People do this all the time.</p>
<p>And they go, oh, like I started reading your books</p>
<p>cause of my wife and you know,</p>
<p>now watch your shows together, keep up the good work.</p>
<p>And I go, what does her boyfriend think?</p>
<p>So that is an example of wit and love</p>
<p>because that person feels seen.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m acknowledging them.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also making a joke at their expense.</p>
<p>We know it&rsquo;s a joke.</p>
<p>So I think language is often used in nonliteral ways</p>
<p>to cue emotional and connectivity.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s difficult, but what you&rsquo;ve done</p>
<p>is difficult to accomplish, but you&rsquo;ve done it well.</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;ve been doing these live streams,</p>
<p>which are nice that people give you a bunch of money</p>
<p>and donations and stuff.</p>
<p>And then you, you&rsquo;ll often like make fun</p>
<p>of certain aspects of their questions and so on,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s always lovely.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not from love.</p>
<p>That is genuine annoyance</p>
<p>cause they ask me some really dumb questions.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re still underlying, it&rsquo;s not even,</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s a kind person under that</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s being communicated.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t know if I get that from your Twitter.</p>
<p>I know I get that from the video,</p>
<p>something about the face, something about like,</p>
<p>Yeah, of course.</p>
<p>The physical presentation.</p>
<p>The more data, the more easy it is</p>
<p>to convey emotion and subtlety.</p>
<p>Absolutely, if you only have literally black and white</p>
<p>letters, it&rsquo;s going to be, or whatever,</p>
<p>white and black, if you have night mode,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to be a very different,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s much more limited information.</p>
<p>Yeah, but this is the fundamental thing is like,</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s another example.</p>
<p>Like if they had access to my face,</p>
<p>like a lot of times some people don&rsquo;t know who I am</p>
<p>and they come at me, call me a Nazi antisemite, right?</p>
<p>And I start talking about the Jews</p>
<p>and just how terrible the Jews are.</p>
<p>Now all my audience knows I&rsquo;m Jewish</p>
<p>that I went to yeshiva.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re sitting there laughing</p>
<p>cause this person is making ass of themselves.</p>
<p>That person has no idea.</p>
<p>But if there was video, then they would be like,</p>
<p>okay, wait a minute, something&rsquo;s up.</p>
<p>Yeah, something&rsquo;s up.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s entertaining.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s fun, but I just, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s scalable.</p>
<p>And ultimately, I&rsquo;m trying to figure out</p>
<p>this whole trolling thing.</p>
<p>Cause I think it&rsquo;s really destructive.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been the outrage mob, the outrage mobs,</p>
<p>just the dynamics of Twitter has been really bothering me.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been trying to figure out if we can try to build</p>
<p>an alternative to Twitter perhaps</p>
<p>or try to encourage Twitter to be better,</p>
<p>how to have nuanced, healthy conversations.</p>
<p>Like the reason I talk about love isn&rsquo;t just for love&rsquo;s sake.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a good base from which to have</p>
<p>difficult conversations.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s a good starting point.</p>
<p>Because if you start, like I would argue that</p>
<p>the kind of conversation you have on Twitter is fun,</p>
<p>but it might not be a good starting point</p>
<p>for a difficult, nuanced conversation.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m not interested in having</p>
<p>those conversations with most people.</p>
<p>No, I know, but.</p>
<p>So I agree with you.</p>
<p>Your point is valid.</p>
<p>Yes, but like I&rsquo;m saying, so if we were trying to have</p>
<p>a difficult, nuanced conversation</p>
<p>about say race in America or policing,</p>
<p>is there institutional racism of policing?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the only conversations that have been nuanced</p>
<p>about it that I&rsquo;ve heard is in the podcasting medium.</p>
<p>I agree with you.</p>
<p>Which is the magic of podcasting, which is great.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s the downside of podcasting</p>
<p>is it&rsquo;s a very small number of people.</p>
<p>Even if it&rsquo;s in the thousands, it&rsquo;s still small.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s millions of people on social media</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re not having nuanced conversation at all.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not capable of it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the difference in your thoughts.</p>
<p>They have no minds.</p>
<p>I believe they are.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no data that shows this.</p>
<p>Both of us aren&rsquo;t being not scientific.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have data to support your world either.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re making the claim.</p>
<p>Well, you are too.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m not.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m looking at an object, the claim that it has in mind.</p>
<p>Well.</p>
<p>No, what?</p>
<p>No, your claim is that people are fundamentally stupid.</p>
<p>Are you a martial artist?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>How&rsquo;s it feel?</p>
<p>I just judo on you.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But you really don&rsquo;t think people are deep down</p>
<p>like capable of being intelligent.</p>
<p>No, not at all.</p>
<p>Not deep down, not surface.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not joking.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not being tongue in cheek.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not being cynical.</p>
<p>I do not at all think they have this capacity.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna think.</p>
<p>Cause you&rsquo;re being so clear about it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not even.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna have to think about that.</p>
<p>You know why?</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s evidence for my position, not proof.</p>
<p>And this is of course data that is of little use,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s of interest.</p>
<p>A lot of times when you have an audience as big as mine</p>
<p>and people come at you,</p>
<p>not only will people say the same thing, the same concept,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll say the same concept in the same way.</p>
<p>That is not a mind.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s surface evidence.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re saying this iceberg looks like this from the surface.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m saying there&rsquo;s an iceberg there</p>
<p>that if challenged can rise to the occasion</p>
<p>of deep thinking and you&rsquo;re saying.</p>
<p>Nope.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just frozen water.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t that the Russian expression?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s ice cream.</p>
<p>No, not.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t it mean like no one&rsquo;s there?</p>
<p>Actually, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Yeah, it means like, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s like thought.</p>
<p>It means.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Well, so you&rsquo;re challenging me</p>
<p>to be a little bit more rigorous.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;ll try.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not challenging you anything.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just saying.</p>
<p>No, not challenging me,</p>
<p>but like I&rsquo;m challenging myself based on what you&rsquo;re saying</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;d like to prove you wrong</p>
<p>and find actual data to show you&rsquo;re wrong.</p>
<p>And I think I can, but I would need to get that data.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s funny you said, I think I can.</p>
<p>When they were working on my biography, Ego and Hubris,</p>
<p>the title I had suggested was</p>
<p>The Little Engine That Could But Shouldn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And they didn&rsquo;t like it.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a great title.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s pretty good, yeah.</p>
<p>Speaking of biographies, I mean,</p>
<p>I read your book or listened to your book.</p>
<p>Listened to.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an audio book from you, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, I did the audio, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You read it?</p>
<p>My Golis, yes.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So this was a.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t do Yaron Brooks voice in the book.</p>
<p>I did all the different voices</p>
<p>because he has a lisp</p>
<p>and I didn&rsquo;t want to sound like I was making fun of him.</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t remember you reading it,</p>
<p>but I was really enjoyed it.</p>
<p>No, okay.</p>
<p>It was good.</p>
<p>It was like a year, a year and a half ago.</p>
<p>This I can prove.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just.</p>
<p>Well, let me at a high level,</p>
<p>see if you can pull this off.</p>
<p>If I ask you, what&rsquo;s the book you write about?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about a group of people</p>
<p>who are united solely by their opposition to progressivism,</p>
<p>who have little else in common,</p>
<p>but who are all frequently caricatured and dismissed</p>
<p>by the larger establishment media.</p>
<p>But you give this kind of story of how it came to be.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>And to me, like we&rsquo;re talking about trolls,</p>
<p>but the internet side of things is quite interesting.</p>
<p>So first of all, how does alt right connect?</p>
<p>So the alt right is the subset of the new right,</p>
<p>which feels that race, not racism,</p>
<p>is the most or one of the most important</p>
<p>socio political issues.</p>
<p>Are any of those folks like part of the mainstream</p>
<p>or worth paying attention to?</p>
<p>None of them are part of the mainstream.</p>
<p>The alt right, by definition,</p>
<p>they would be part of the mainstream.</p>
<p>They would not be part of them.</p>
<p>No, they would not.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know that any of them.</p>
<p>Well, worth is not a position.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not in a position to say worth.</p>
<p>I would say that it is of use</p>
<p>to be familiar with their arguments</p>
<p>because to dismiss any school of thought,</p>
<p>especially one that has historically gained leverage,</p>
<p>especially one that has historically gained leverage</p>
<p>in very dark ways, especially in America,</p>
<p>in Europe and other places,</p>
<p>just to say, oh, they&rsquo;re racist.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t need to think about them.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t behoove you.</p>
<p>So what lessons do we draw from the 4chan side of things,</p>
<p>like the internet side of the movement?</p>
<p>Tits or get the fuck out.</p>
<p>Can you define every single word in there?</p>
<p>Tits or breasts or get the fuck out.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s from 4chan.</p>
<p>Okay, what&rsquo;s it mean?</p>
<p>Oh, sometimes like a woman will appear in 4chan</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll just reply, tits or get the fuck out.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to understand what that,</p>
<p>oh, oh, that&rsquo;s a way.</p>
<p>I just, very slow.</p>
<p>Oh, so that&rsquo;s, okay, so that&rsquo;s very disrespectful</p>
<p>towards female members of the community.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t understand.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s rules to this community</p>
<p>and one of them is we&rsquo;re not very good with women.</p>
<p>Is that, that&rsquo;s one of the rules?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more of a principle than a rule.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a principle?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not going to ever get laid.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fundamentally the principle.</p>
<p>Is there other principles?</p>
<p>But we are gonna get pics.</p>
<p>Pics.</p>
<p>Sometimes.</p>
<p>Sometimes on the internet.</p>
<p>Sometimes they GTFO.</p>
<p>Okay, so is there other actual principles of,</p>
<p>so like it&rsquo;s, from my maybe naive perspective</p>
<p>is they have like the darkest aspects of trolling,</p>
<p>which is like take nothing serious,</p>
<p>make a game out of everything.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not 4chan per se.</p>
<p>One of the things that you will learn in 4chan,</p>
<p>which I think is very healthy,</p>
<p>is if you have an idiosocratic or unique worldview</p>
<p>or focus on an aspect of history or culture,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll be able to find like minded people</p>
<p>who you will engage with you and discuss it</p>
<p>without being preemptively dismissive.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an ideal that they.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s not ideal.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s something that happens a lot.</p>
<p>Now 4chan&rsquo;s not really,</p>
<p>like Paul is their board with politics,</p>
<p>but they will get into some,</p>
<p>like the people there are much more erudite than you&rsquo;d think.</p>
<p>So they do take,</p>
<p>my perception was they take nothing seriously.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s things that they take seriously,</p>
<p>like discussing ideas.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give you one example.</p>
<p>There was a video someone posted</p>
<p>of a girl who put kittens in a bag</p>
<p>and threw it in a river.</p>
<p>And they found out where she was within a day</p>
<p>and got her like arrested.</p>
<p>So yeah, they do take some things very seriously.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s like an extreme that,</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>First of all, that&rsquo;s heartwarming</p>
<p>that they wouldn&rsquo;t somehow turn that into a thing.</p>
<p>That feels like more of a, what is it?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the other one?</p>
<p>8chan?</p>
<p>8chan&rsquo;s twice as good as 4chan, yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s their slogan.</p>
<p>But it feels like they&rsquo;re the kind of community</p>
<p>that would take that kitten situation</p>
<p>and make a mockery of it.</p>
<p>Yeah, they&rsquo;re darker than 4chan.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even, I&rsquo;m not allowed to talk about 16chan.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m already overwhelmed clearly by 4chan lingo.</p>
<p>I literally wrote down in my notes,</p>
<p>like in doing research for this conversation,</p>
<p>I learned the word pleb.</p>
<p>And I wanted to ask you what this pleb means.</p>
<p>Do you know what pleb means?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>I saw, I mean, actually, no, I don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>You know what a pleb is?</p>
<p>I just, I don&rsquo;t know what a pleb is.</p>
<p>Like a plebiscite or plebeian.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>But does it mean something more sophisticated?</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s a very unsophisticated mechanism</p>
<p>of being dismissive.</p>
<p>Of like the regular people.</p>
<p>Yeah, or someone who comes at me on Twitter.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>All right, so back to the 4chan alt right.</p>
<p>Wasn&rsquo;t the&hellip;</p>
<p>Those are very different concepts.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t conflate them.</p>
<p>But which internet culture was the alt right born out of?</p>
<p>Well, alt right was more born of blogs.</p>
<p>And people had different blogs that were posting</p>
<p>what they call like racial realism,</p>
<p>which is scientific racism, so called.</p>
<p>And breaking down issues from a racialist perspective.</p>
<p>So that wasn&rsquo;t, 4chan is much more dynamic.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a message board.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very fluid.</p>
<p>So it doesn&rsquo;t lend itself</p>
<p>to these kind of in depth analysis of ideas or history.</p>
<p>But it spreads them.</p>
<p>Like it&hellip;</p>
<p>It spreads them as memes, yeah.</p>
<p>And you know, but&hellip;</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not an essential mechanism</p>
<p>of the alt right, historically?</p>
<p>No, no, no, no, no, no.</p>
<p>So it was mostly about blogs.</p>
<p>Okay, so what do you make of the psychology</p>
<p>of this kind of worldview?</p>
<p>When you have&hellip;</p>
<p>This goes to your conspiracy theory subject earlier.</p>
<p>When you have a little bit of knowledge about something,</p>
<p>about history that no one&rsquo;s talking about,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s only one group that is talking about it,</p>
<p>and you have no alternative answers,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to be drawn to that group.</p>
<p>So because issues about race, anti semitism, homophobia</p>
<p>are so taboo in our culture,</p>
<p>understandably there&rsquo;s good reasons.</p>
<p>If you start putting things like,</p>
<p>how old should you be to have sex with kids</p>
<p>and just have regular conversations,</p>
<p>eventually some people are gonna start</p>
<p>taking some positions you don&rsquo;t like.</p>
<p>So some things have to be sanctified to some extent.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re the only ones talking about it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna be drawn to that subculture.</p>
<p>And where does the alt right stand now?</p>
<p>I mean, I hear that term used&hellip;</p>
<p>So the term has been weaponized by the corporate press</p>
<p>for people that they want to read out of society.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s used both on individual levels,</p>
<p>like people like Gavin McIngus, Milo Yiannopoulos,</p>
<p>some others.</p>
<p>I mean, I think they&rsquo;ve referred to Trump as alt right.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s become a slur, just like incel or bot,</p>
<p>that has become largely removed from its original meaning.</p>
<p>Do you have a sense that there&rsquo;s still a movement</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s alt right or like&hellip;</p>
<p>Yeah, they call themselves now&hellip;</p>
<p>Okay, so there&rsquo;s something called the dissonant right.</p>
<p>And they say, we&rsquo;re completely not like the alt right</p>
<p>because the alt right&rsquo;s A, B, and C, and we&rsquo;re B, C, D.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a huge overlap.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very much the same people.</p>
<p>Is there intellectuals that still represent</p>
<p>some aspect of the movement?</p>
<p>I mean, sure.</p>
<p>Are you tracking this?</p>
<p>Not that much anymore.</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;re&hellip;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t find it particularly as&hellip;</p>
<p>Now that the book&rsquo;s done,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking more into history for my next book.</p>
<p>You mentioned communism?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna talk a lot about the Cold War.</p>
<p>So this kind of stuff has largely fallen away</p>
<p>from my radar to some extent.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s been a very effective movement</p>
<p>to get them marginalized and silenced.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re not as deep of a concern</p>
<p>in terms of concern or not,</p>
<p>just their impact on society.</p>
<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s much lessened, yeah.</p>
<p>So as a troll on Twitter, in the best sense of the word,</p>
<p>what do you make of cancel culture?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s Maoism.</p>
<p>I mean, corporate America has done a far better job</p>
<p>of implementing Maoism than the communist party ever could.</p>
<p>You had this meeting not that long ago</p>
<p>from I think it was Northwestern University Law School</p>
<p>where everyone on the call got up</p>
<p>and said that they were racist.</p>
<p>I mean, this is something that legally</p>
<p>you should be very averse to saying,</p>
<p>even if it were true.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s this kind of concept of getting up</p>
<p>and confessing your sins before the collective</p>
<p>is something completely.</p>
<p>Oh, sorry, they admitted this of themselves?</p>
<p>Yeah, they were like,</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re saying because they&rsquo;re white,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re inherently racist.</p>
<p>So my name&rsquo;s John, I&rsquo;m a racist.</p>
<p>My name&rsquo;s this, I&rsquo;m a racist.</p>
<p>You hear it and you&rsquo;re like, okay, this is Looney Tunes.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re saying that, wow, that&rsquo;s so much,</p>
<p>you took a step further.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re saying there&rsquo;s like a deep underlying force</p>
<p>that cancels culture.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just some kind of mob.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s not a mob at all.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a systemic organized movement being used</p>
<p>for very nefarious purposes</p>
<p>and to dominate an entire nation.</p>
<p>How do we fight it?</p>
<p>Because I sense it inside.</p>
<p>You know, I used to defend academia more</p>
<p>because I still do to some extent.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a nuanced discussion because, you know,</p>
<p>like folks like Jordan Peterson</p>
<p>and a lot of people that kind of attack academia,</p>
<p>they refer, they really are talking about gender studies</p>
<p>at certain departments.</p>
<p>And me from MIT, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the University of Science and Engineering</p>
<p>and the faculty there really don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>about these issues or haven&rsquo;t traditionally thought of,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s beginning to even infiltrate there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the, you know, it&rsquo;s starting to infiltrate engineering</p>
<p>and sciences outside of biology.</p>
<p>Like let&rsquo;s put biology with the gender studies.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m talking about sciences</p>
<p>that really don&rsquo;t have anything to do with gender.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s starting to infiltrate and it worries me.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know exactly why,</p>
<p>like I don&rsquo;t know exactly what the negative effect</p>
<p>there would be, except it feels like it&rsquo;s anti intellectual.</p>
<p>Oh yes, of course.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not sure what to,</p>
<p>because on the surface,</p>
<p>it feels like a path towards progress.</p>
<p>At first, when I&rsquo;m like zoomed out, you know,</p>
<p>just like squinting my eyes, you know,</p>
<p>not even in detail looking at things,</p>
<p>but when I actually joined the conversation</p>
<p>to like listen in the conversation on quote unquote diversity,</p>
<p>it quickly makes me realize</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s no interest in making a better world.</p>
<p>No, no, it&rsquo;s about domination.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about getting, yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a way for, if you are a lowest status white person,</p>
<p>using anti racism is the only mechanism you will have</p>
<p>to feel superior to another human being.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s very useful for them in terms of fighting it.</p>
<p>One of my suggestions has been to seize</p>
<p>all university endowments,</p>
<p>which are the crystallization of privilege</p>
<p>and distribute that money as reparations.</p>
<p>So be very effective by turning two populations</p>
<p>against each other and strongly diminishing</p>
<p>the university&rsquo;s intellectual hegemony.</p>
<p>The universities are absolutely the real villains</p>
<p>in the picture.</p>
<p>Thankfully, they&rsquo;re also the least prepared</p>
<p>to be aggressed upon.</p>
<p>And after the government and the corporate press,</p>
<p>they are the last leg of the stool,</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s coming,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s gonna get ugly, and I cannot wait.</p>
<p>So this is where you and I disagree.</p>
<p>Part one, yeah, we disagree in the sense</p>
<p>that you want to dismantle broken institutions.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;re broken.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re powerful.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re working like by design.</p>
<p>I think for over 100 years,</p>
<p>they have been talking about bringing</p>
<p>the next generation of American leaders,</p>
<p>which is code, for promulgating an ideology</p>
<p>based on egalitarian principles and world domination.</p>
<p>Let me try to express my lived experience.</p>
<p>Okay, sure.</p>
<p>My experience at MIT is that there&rsquo;s a bunch</p>
<p>of administrators that are, the bureaucracy,</p>
<p>that I can say, this is the nice thing</p>
<p>about having a podcast, I don&rsquo;t give a damn,</p>
<p>is they&rsquo;re pretty useless.</p>
<p>In fact, they get in the way.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s faculty, there&rsquo;s professors,</p>
<p>that are incredible.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re incredible human beings</p>
<p>that all they do all day, they&rsquo;re too busy,</p>
<p>but for the most part, what they do all day</p>
<p>is just like continually pursue different</p>
<p>little trajectories of curiosities</p>
<p>in the various avenues of science that they work on.</p>
<p>And as a side effect of that, they mentor</p>
<p>a group of students, sometimes a large group of students,</p>
<p>and also teach courses, and they&rsquo;re constantly</p>
<p>sharing their passion with others.</p>
<p>And my experience is it&rsquo;s just a bunch of people</p>
<p>who are curious about engineering and math</p>
<p>and science, chemistry, artificial intelligence,</p>
<p>computer science, what I&rsquo;m most familiar with.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s never this feeling of MIT</p>
<p>being broken somehow, like this kind of feeling.</p>
<p>Like if I talk to you just now, or like Eric Weinstein,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a feeling like stuff is on fire, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something deeply broken.</p>
<p>But when I&rsquo;m in the system, especially before the COVID,</p>
<p>before this kind of tension, everything was great.</p>
<p>There was no discussion of, even diversity,</p>
<p>all that kind of stuff, the toxic stuff</p>
<p>that we might be talking about right now,</p>
<p>none of that was happening.</p>
<p>There was a bunch of people just in love with cool ideas,</p>
<p>exploring ideas, being curious, and learning,</p>
<p>and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t, my sense of academia was this is the place</p>
<p>where kids in their 20s, 30s, and 40s can continue</p>
<p>the playground of science, having fun.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, if you destroy academia, if you destroy universities,</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;re suggesting kind of lessening their power,</p>
<p>you take away the playground from these kids</p>
<p>to play.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna be hard for you to tell me</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m anti playground.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, I guess I&rsquo;m saying you&rsquo;re anti</p>
<p>certain kinds of playgrounds, which is.</p>
<p>Yeah, the ones that have the broken glass on the floor.</p>
<p>Yeah, I am against those kinds of playgrounds.</p>
<p>No, you&rsquo;re, you&rsquo;re, you&rsquo;re.</p>
<p>Yes. Nope.</p>
<p>See, see.</p>
<p>Now you see, now you listen.</p>
<p>Now you, now you wait.</p>
<p>Yeah, I would say you&rsquo;re being the watchful mother who,</p>
<p>the one kid who hurt themselves in the glass.</p>
<p>One kid, it&rsquo;s an entire, it&rsquo;s generation after generation.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a watchful mother.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m the guy with the flamethrower.</p>
<p>No, I, I, I understand that.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re using the one kid who was always kind of like</p>
<p>weird, aka gender studies department.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>That, that hurt themselves on the glass,</p>
<p>as opposed to the people who are like,</p>
<p>obviously having fun in the playground and not playing</p>
<p>by the glass, the broken glass.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re just, I mean, to me,</p>
<p>some of the best innovations in science</p>
<p>happen in universities.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t forget that universities don&rsquo;t have this</p>
<p>liberal, like politics literally in every conversation</p>
<p>until this year, until this year,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something happening.</p>
<p>But every conversation I&rsquo;ve ever had had nothing to do</p>
<p>with politics.</p>
<p>We never, Trump never came up.</p>
<p>None of that ever come up.</p>
<p>Nothing.</p>
<p>Like all this kind of idea that there&rsquo;s liberal, all that.</p>
<p>But that, that&rsquo;s in the humanities.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But do you think MIT, Massachusetts Institute of Technology</p>
<p>might be a little bit of an outlier?</p>
<p>Yeah, that probably is.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But I, I don&rsquo;t, I honestly don&rsquo;t think when people</p>
<p>criticize academia, they&rsquo;re looking at,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re in fact also picking the outliers,</p>
<p>which is they&rsquo;re picking some of the quote unquote</p>
<p>strongest gender studies departments.</p>
<p>This is nonsensical.</p>
<p>When I was at Bucknell, it was a college student.</p>
<p>We had to take, you know, we had a bunch of electives</p>
<p>and I wanted to take a class on individual,</p>
<p>American individualism.</p>
<p>One of the texts of the five that we had to read</p>
<p>was Birth of a Nation, the movie about the Klan.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s no department where these people</p>
<p>are not thoroughgoing, hardcore ideologues.</p>
<p>This is not a gender.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the humanities, that&rsquo;s the humanities.</p>
<p>Fine, all the humanities, not just gender studies.</p>
<p>Okay, fine.</p>
<p>I can give you.</p>
<p>Theory, English, all of them, every university,</p>
<p>as you know, has it mandatory in the curriculum</p>
<p>they have to take a bunch of these propaganda classes.</p>
<p>I look forward to YouTube comments</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re being more eloquent</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re speaking to the thing</p>
<p>that a lot of people agree with</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m being my usual slow self</p>
<p>and people are going to say not very nice things about me.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t say anything that nice about Lex, please.</p>
<p>Let me try to just.</p>
<p>Just shoot up a school.</p>
<p>That would be preferable.</p>
<p>There he goes again.</p>
<p>Only the teachers.</p>
<p>Going to the darkest possible place.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s sunshine, baby, schools.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where everyone goes to be happy, playgrounds.</p>
<p>There he goes, dark ear.</p>
<p>Just dives right in, just go dark</p>
<p>and then just comes back up to the surface.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have to feel this way anymore.</p>
<p>Just one day in the world.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re probably a figment of my imagination.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not even having this podcast.</p>
<p>Well, after 18 Red Bulls, I&rsquo;m surprised</p>
<p>you could see anything.</p>
<p>This is like Fight Club.</p>
<p>Red Bull gives you delirium.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I got into it with Ed Norton yesterday on Twitter.</p>
<p>Oh, really?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Is he like the rest of the celebrities?</p>
<p>Yeah, he&rsquo;s like, oh, this is an existential threat</p>
<p>to America, Trump&rsquo;s a fascist.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s delegitimizing the Oval Office.</p>
<p>I said, what an odd endorsement of Trump.</p>
<p>Well, you should have went with a bad pit.</p>
<p>He might have a different opinion.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>So Fight Club reference, okay.</p>
<p>This conversation is over.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to draw a line between science and engineering</p>
<p>and science not including like the biological aspect,</p>
<p>the parts of biology that touch</p>
<p>and humanities and biology.</p>
<p>Like I feel because humanities,</p>
<p>if you just look at the percentage of universities,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s still a minority percentage.</p>
<p>And I would actually draw a different,</p>
<p>I think they serve very different purposes.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s actually a broken part about universities</p>
<p>about like, why is some of the best research</p>
<p>in the world done at universities?</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t, like there might be a different,</p>
<p>like MIT, it feels weird that a faculty.</p>
<p>Yeah, these are conceptually different things.</p>
<p>Like we do research and we teach,</p>
<p>why is this the same diagram?</p>
<p>Yeah, it feels weird.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s just, but I&rsquo;m also,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m coming to like the defense of the engineers</p>
<p>that never talk about,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not like, my mind isn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not like deluded or something</p>
<p>where I&rsquo;m not seeing the house on fire.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just saying, I am seeing the house</p>
<p>because I also lived in Harvard Square.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m seeing Harvard, but in.</p>
<p>And you see the tanks coming?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re coming, Lex.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re coming.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna be so beautiful.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll be like the American beauty, the plastic bag.</p>
<p>I just won&rsquo;t be able to stop crying</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;ll be so beautiful.</p>
<p>Yeah, I can already see it.</p>
<p>But the engineering departments where like,</p>
<p>I believe that the Elon Musk&rsquo;s of the world,</p>
<p>that the, like the innovation</p>
<p>that will make a better world is happening.</p>
<p>And like, let&rsquo;s not burn that down.</p>
<p>Cause that has nothing to do with any,</p>
<p>like they&rsquo;re all like sitting quietly</p>
<p>in the, while like, while the humanities</p>
<p>and all these kinds of diversity programs,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not having any of these discussions.</p>
<p>Listen, my Soviet brother, you both know,</p>
<p>we both know that ice water runs in our veins.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re calling for mercy,</p>
<p>that is not how I&rsquo;m wired,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m not closing the door.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m actually realizing now,</p>
<p>so for people listening to this,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll probably prepend this in saying that</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m even slower than usual.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t sleep last night,</p>
<p>but I feel I&rsquo;m actually realizing just how slow I am</p>
<p>and how much preparation I need to do.</p>
<p>And if I would like to defend aspects of academia,</p>
<p>I better come prepared.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think you need to defend them.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;m granting you your premise freely.</p>
<p>No, you might be.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think the world is.</p>
<p>But actually you just defeat your own argument</p>
<p>because it is not at all have to be the way</p>
<p>that a phenomenal research institution like MIT,</p>
<p>which no one disputes,</p>
<p>has to also be an educational establishment.</p>
<p>These two things are not at all necessarily interconnected.</p>
<p>But then you have to offer a way to separate.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>But like, I&rsquo;m not a big fan, everybody&rsquo;s different,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m not a fan of criticizing institutions</p>
<p>without offering a way to change.</p>
<p>And especially when I&rsquo;m like, have ability to change,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to, yeah, I&rsquo;d like to offer a path.</p>
<p>Like.</p>
<p>What if they were in students, they were all mentor,</p>
<p>like, what&rsquo;s the opposite of a mentor?</p>
<p>Mentee.</p>
<p>Protege?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the term when you like.</p>
<p>Graduate students.</p>
<p>When you work at a place, like interns,</p>
<p>not an intern, it&rsquo;s not the word I&rsquo;m thinking of.</p>
<p>But anyway, like basically they&rsquo;re working there</p>
<p>instead of going to college there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s possible, but it&rsquo;s going against tradition.</p>
<p>And so you have to build new institutions and.</p>
<p>And have these engineers building new things, that&rsquo;s crazy.</p>
<p>These research engineers,</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re going to be building things.</p>
<p>Well, one of the things, cause you&rsquo;re kind of a.</p>
<p>Apprentice, that&rsquo;s the word I was looking at.</p>
<p>Apprentice.</p>
<p>Which is ironic, we&rsquo;re talking about Trump</p>
<p>and we couldn&rsquo;t think of the word apprentice.</p>
<p>Yeah, well done.</p>
<p>We should both be fired.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re fired.</p>
<p>Yeah, there you go.</p>
<p>These Russian Jews, so quick with their wit.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>But the thing is, you&rsquo;re a fan of freedom.</p>
<p>I am.</p>
<p>And there is intellectual freedom.</p>
<p>People, this is what I was trying to articulate,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m failing to articulate,</p>
<p>but there truly is complete intellectual freedom</p>
<p>within universities on topics of science and engineering.</p>
<p>I believe you, I agree with you.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s going to take much persuasion,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ll give you an example.</p>
<p>When that, I&rsquo;m sure you know more details about this</p>
<p>than I do.</p>
<p>When that scientist engineered that probe</p>
<p>to land on that comet,</p>
<p>and the articles are written</p>
<p>because this Hawaiian shirt he was wearing</p>
<p>had like pinup girls on it,</p>
<p>which I think his female student sewed for him</p>
<p>or something, or his ex girlfriend.</p>
<p>And he had to apologize.</p>
<p>This is what Rand was talking about.</p>
<p>That the great accomplishments of men</p>
<p>have to say I&rsquo;m sorry to the lowest,</p>
<p>most despicable, disgusting people.</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Let me bring this case up because I think about this.</p>
<p>This might not mean much to you,</p>
<p>but it means a lot to certain aspects</p>
<p>of the computer science community.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a guy named Richard Stallman.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you know who that is.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the founder of the Free Software Foundation.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like a big Linux.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s one of the key people</p>
<p>in the history of computer science,</p>
<p>one of those open source people, right?</p>
<p>But he is like, I believe he&rsquo;s one of the hardcore ones,</p>
<p>which is like all software should be free.</p>
<p>Okay, so it&rsquo;s very interesting personality,</p>
<p>very key person in the GNU,</p>
<p>just like Linus Torvald, key person.</p>
<p>So, but he also kind of speaks his mind.</p>
<p>And on a certain chain of conversations at MIT</p>
<p>that was leaked to the New York Times,</p>
<p>then it was published, led him to be fired</p>
<p>or pushed out of MIT recently, maybe a year ago.</p>
<p>And it always sat weird with me.</p>
<p>So what happened is there&rsquo;s a few undergraduate students</p>
<p>that called Marvin Minsky.</p>
<p>Not sure if you&rsquo;re familiar with who that is.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard the name.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s one of the seminal people in artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>They said that they called him a rapist</p>
<p>because he met with Jeffrey Epstein.</p>
<p>And Jeffrey Epstein solicited,</p>
<p>these are the best facts known to me</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m aware of, that&rsquo;s what was stated on the chain,</p>
<p>is he solicited a 17,</p>
<p>but it might&rsquo;ve been an 18 year old girl,</p>
<p>to come up to Marvin Minsky</p>
<p>and ask him if he wanted to have sex with her.</p>
<p>So Jeffrey Epstein told the girl.</p>
<p>She came up to Marvin Minsky,</p>
<p>who was at that time, I think, seven years old.</p>
<p>And his wife was there too, Marvin Minsky&rsquo;s wife.</p>
<p>And he said no, or like awkwardly saying no thanks.</p>
<p>And that was stated in the email thread</p>
<p>as Marvin participating in sexual assault</p>
<p>and rape of this unwilling sexual assault.</p>
<p>And it was called rape of this person, right?</p>
<p>Of this woman that propositioned him.</p>
<p>And then Richard Stallman, who&rsquo;s, he&rsquo;s kind of known for this.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s very, he&rsquo;s, you make fun of me being a robot,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s kind of like a debugger.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, well, that sentence is not,</p>
<p>what you said is not correct.</p>
<p>So he like corrected the person,</p>
<p>basically made it seem like the use of the word rape</p>
<p>is not correct, because that&rsquo;s not the definition of rape.</p>
<p>And then he was attacked for saying,</p>
<p>oh, now you&rsquo;re playing with definitions of rape.</p>
<p>Rape is rape is the answer, right?</p>
<p>And then that was leaked in him defending.</p>
<p>So the way it was leaked,</p>
<p>it was reported as him defending rape.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the way it was reported.</p>
<p>And he was pushed out and he didn&rsquo;t really give a damn.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, he doesn&rsquo;t seem to make a big deal out of it.</p>
<p>He just left.</p>
<p>He made an example of him.</p>
<p>They made an example and that,</p>
<p>and that everyone was afraid to defend him.</p>
<p>So like, there&rsquo;s a bunch of faculty.</p>
<p>One.</p>
<p>Dude, you&rsquo;re from the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t this hit close to home for you?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what to think of it.</p>
<p>It hits close to home, but it was basically,</p>
<p>at least at MIT, now MIT is such a light place with this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not common at MIT,</p>
<p>but it was like 18, 19 year old kids,</p>
<p>undergraduate kids with this kind of fire in them.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just very few of them,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re the ones that raise all this kind of fuss.</p>
<p>And the entirety of the administration,</p>
<p>all the faculty are afraid to stand up to them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so interesting to me.</p>
<p>Like, I don&rsquo;t know if I should be afraid of that.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t think you should be afraid</p>
<p>that someone who&rsquo;s trying to be specific</p>
<p>when it comes to charges of violent assault</p>
<p>is looking for that clarity,</p>
<p>can get their life out of search of his room?</p>
<p>Let me give you more context.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a little bit more context to Richard Stallman,</p>
<p>which is.</p>
<p>He was also a rapist.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>I left out that part.</p>
<p>He liked raping people.</p>
<p>But he&rsquo;s had a history through his life</p>
<p>of every once in a while wearing the Hawaiian shirt with,</p>
<p>like he would make.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a fat.</p>
<p>Sorry, but he&rsquo;s a fat unattractive.</p>
<p>Like what Trump referred to the hacker.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, the guy in the basement.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s Richard.</p>
<p>Okay, I love.</p>
<p>He is what he is.</p>
<p>He like, he would eat his own.</p>
<p>He would pick skin from his feet in lectures</p>
<p>and just eat it.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Okay, yeah.</p>
<p>Those videos of him doing that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not joking.</p>
<p>He must really be behind the spectrum then.</p>
<p>Yeah, okay.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>And you know,</p>
<p>I think in his office,</p>
<p>door, he wrote something like</p>
<p>hacker plus lover of ladies or something like that.</p>
<p>Like something kind of.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Unprofessional.</p>
<p>Yeah, unprofessional.</p>
<p>And a little creepy.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>No, that&rsquo;s fair.</p>
<p>So he was also.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re looking for an excuse to get rid of him,</p>
<p>it sounds like.</p>
<p>No, he was just, who&rsquo;s they?</p>
<p>The administration.</p>
<p>Yeah, probably, probably.</p>
<p>A lot of times what people don&rsquo;t realize,</p>
<p>and this would be my defense of cancel culture.</p>
<p>A lot of times when someone gets fired</p>
<p>over something like this, this isn&rsquo;t why.</p>
<p>This is just giving them cover to get rid of them</p>
<p>without getting a lawsuit.</p>
<p>Yeah, but it&rsquo;s still.</p>
<p>Right, so I think, I guess what I&rsquo;m trying to communicate</p>
<p>is he was a little weird and creepy</p>
<p>and he may not be the best for the community,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s not necessarily the message it&rsquo;s sent</p>
<p>to the rest of the community.</p>
<p>The message is sent to the rest of the community</p>
<p>that being clear about words</p>
<p>or the usage of the word rape</p>
<p>is like you should call everything rape.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s basically the message it was sent.</p>
<p>Or you should call it we say rape, rape.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about submission.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;d be very happy to know</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a lot of people,</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s very crucified of this,</p>
<p>like Betsy DeVos, the performance department of education,</p>
<p>who are aware of this.</p>
<p>They are aware that this completely contradicts due process.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re aware of how a rape accusation</p>
<p>is something not to be taken seriously,</p>
<p>but because it&rsquo;s not to be taken seriously,</p>
<p>it has to be also taken seriously in the other context</p>
<p>that once that word is around a male,</p>
<p>this can ruin his entire life.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the sticky thing of the word.</p>
<p>Like I, like I think about this a lot that,</p>
<p>like how would I defend it if somebody,</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;ve never, I can honestly say</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never done anything close to creepy in my life</p>
<p>like with women.</p>
<p>But you wouldn&rsquo;t know it if you had, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>A lot of these creepy guys don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;re creepy.</p>
<p>They think they&rsquo;re being cute.</p>
<p>Yeah, but I&rsquo;m just telling you,</p>
<p>even like, fine, let&rsquo;s say, right,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say I&rsquo;m not aware of it.</p>
<p>But the point that I am aware of</p>
<p>is that somebody could just completely make something up.</p>
<p>Correct, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, okay.</p>
<p>And like how, what would I?</p>
<p>No, he denied the charges.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an article around everything he did, supposedly,</p>
<p>and it goes, Mr. Friedman denied the charges, yeah.</p>
<p>But what creeps me out?</p>
<p>That happened, can I interrupt?</p>
<p>Zora Neale Hurston is one of my favorite writers.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s from the Harlem Renaissance.</p>
<p>She wrote, Their Eyes Are Watching God,</p>
<p>and a couple of other books.</p>
<p>She was just an amazing, amazing figure.</p>
<p>Her biography is called Wrapped in Rainbows.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a masterpiece.</p>
<p>I think I read it one day.</p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t recommend her enough.</p>
<p>Fascinating, fascinating woman.</p>
<p>During the 30s, I think it was, or 1940,</p>
<p>she was out of the country.</p>
<p>She was accused of molesting a teenage boy.</p>
<p>She wasn&rsquo;t in America.</p>
<p>This could be proven.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s absolutely false, not even a question.</p>
<p>She was indicted, and she wanted to kill herself</p>
<p>because she&rsquo;s like, people are gonna see these things,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re gonna think maybe there&rsquo;s some truth to it.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s voluntary.</p>
<p>What they&rsquo;re just gonna, and you could understand</p>
<p>why she&rsquo;d be suicidal over this.</p>
<p>So yeah, this is something that&rsquo;s been going on</p>
<p>for a long time, and the fact that it&rsquo;s becoming,</p>
<p>I do agree, it&rsquo;s important.</p>
<p>I know a lot of women who have been sexually assaulted,</p>
<p>more than I&rsquo;m happy that I know.</p>
<p>And if I know that many, that means there&rsquo;s more.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s a good idea that they feel seen,</p>
<p>that they don&rsquo;t feel wounded, they don&rsquo;t feel damaged,</p>
<p>that they could talk to their friends.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, man, this sucks is happening to you.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re a slut.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re asking for it.</p>
<p>I think you feel violated.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s gross.</p>
<p>Talk to me.</p>
<p>I do think that that&rsquo;s important.</p>
<p>And I also think it&rsquo;s important though,</p>
<p>when things get kind of in a frenzy,</p>
<p>that a lot of people are like,</p>
<p>yeah, I also had something happen.</p>
<p>And very quickly the line between he grabbed my boob</p>
<p>and he violently raped me,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think these two things are the same at all.</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;re both sexual assault,</p>
<p>but in terms of what someone can deal with the next day,</p>
<p>the next month, 10 years later,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;re similar scenarios.</p>
<p>I had Juanita Brodrick on my show</p>
<p>and hearing her talk about her alleged rape by Bill Clinton</p>
<p>was very disturbing for me, very disturbing to hear.</p>
<p>Because it was like half an hour.</p>
<p>So we think of these things and think,</p>
<p>okay, hold her down, blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p>And then it&rsquo;s done.</p>
<p>Half an hour when,</p>
<p>just even someone physically holding you down</p>
<p>for half an hour.</p>
<p>Like not even a sexual assault.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s traumatic.</p>
<p>You think, your brain&rsquo;s gonna think, am I gonna die?</p>
<p>When I zoom out,</p>
<p>I think that ultimately this is gonna lead</p>
<p>to a better world.</p>
<p>Like empowering women to speak to those kinds of experiences,</p>
<p>the benefit of it outweighs the&hellip;</p>
<p>The issue is whenever people are given a weapon,</p>
<p>some are going to use it in nefarious ways.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the lesson of history.</p>
<p>Males, females, whites, blacks, children, adults.</p>
<p>When people are given a mechanism to execute power</p>
<p>over others, some are gonna use it.</p>
<p>Can I ask you for a therapy thing?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>On trolling, in a sense.</p>
<p>Because I mentioned somebody making up something about me.</p>
<p>I feel, because I wear my heart on my sleeve,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not good with these attacks.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;ve been attacked recently,</p>
<p>just being called a fraud and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Just light stuff.</p>
<p>Like I haven&rsquo;t, you know, it was like, it hurt.</p>
<p>Okay, well, let me help you.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;m a New Yorker.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m serious.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s why.</p>
<p>In New York, a lot of times you&rsquo;ll be walking</p>
<p>with your friend and a homeless person will come up to you</p>
<p>and start yelling things at you.</p>
<p>Your reaction isn&rsquo;t in those circumstances.</p>
<p>Let me hear this out.</p>
<p>Your reaction is physical safety and getting away.</p>
<p>Now, it&rsquo;s not impossible that that homeless person</p>
<p>is actually saying the truth.</p>
<p>This happened to a friend of mine.</p>
<p>This guy wasn&rsquo;t homeless</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s walking down the street on Smith Street</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s just talking out loud.</p>
<p>And he goes, why they call them hipsters?</p>
<p>What are they hip to?</p>
<p>And she chuckles.</p>
<p>And he goes, what are you laughing at, fatso?</p>
<p>You start something, I&rsquo;ll finish it.</p>
<p>And she just couldn&rsquo;t move.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s my main problem</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s the first thing he went to.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know that I have any advice,</p>
<p>but when you hear something like this,</p>
<p>I think you need to be better in terms of boundaries.</p>
<p>I think you should not perceive this as a fellow human,</p>
<p>but as a crazy homeless person,</p>
<p>because if this fellow human,</p>
<p>if I thought that you were a fraud in some context,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a very weird word to use</p>
<p>because fraudulent podcaster, these are real mics,</p>
<p>but if I thought.</p>
<p>Well, a scientist or a human.</p>
<p>Sure, but I would ask myself,</p>
<p>is this person in a position to make this judgment</p>
<p>or are they backing it up?</p>
<p>Are they saying, here, your conclusions were wrong,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s some mistakes in your data</p>
<p>and you can engage with them in ideas,</p>
<p>but whenever someone uses a word</p>
<p>to entirely dismiss your life</p>
<p>without having the knowledge of your life,</p>
<p>you do not have to take that seriously.</p>
<p>I appreciate that kind of idea,</p>
<p>but some things aren&rsquo;t about data,</p>
<p>like I see myself as a fraud often</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s more psychology of it.</p>
<p>If I can reduce something to reason,</p>
<p>I can probably be fine.</p>
<p>My worry is the same as the worry of teenage girls</p>
<p>that get bullied online.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like when I&rsquo;m being open and fragile on the internet,</p>
<p>it affects me in a way where I can&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>the reason doesn&rsquo;t help.</p>
<p>So it helps me, but.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t block people enough.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very heavy with the blocking.</p>
<p>No, so yeah, I block.</p>
<p>Very heavy.</p>
<p>I block, it&rsquo;s helped a lot.</p>
<p>Any aggressive banality, I block immediately.</p>
<p>I also think time is gonna help.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re,</p>
<p>like you didn&rsquo;t grow up wanting to be a podcaster, right?</p>
<p>That wasn&rsquo;t your aspiration.</p>
<p>So in some sense, you are gonna feel like a fraud</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re like, I don&rsquo;t have any training for this.</p>
<p>I have a training for a scientist.</p>
<p>I can talk to you about artificial intelligence</p>
<p>for literally hours, but in terms of this,</p>
<p>like I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m doing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m kind of, so when they call you a fake,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, yeah, you&rsquo;re kind of right</p>
<p>because like I did kind of stumble into this</p>
<p>and this is not my pedigree.</p>
<p>So I think that kind of probably speaks to you</p>
<p>on some level.</p>
<p>Well, but they&rsquo;re attacking not the podcast thing,</p>
<p>but more like the same,</p>
<p>people call Elon Musk a fraud too,</p>
<p>which that&rsquo;s the way I rationalize it.</p>
<p>Like, well, if they&rsquo;re calling him a fraud</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re calling me a fraud,</p>
<p>like even if you have rockets that go into,</p>
<p>like if you successfully have rockets</p>
<p>landing back on earth, reusable rockets,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re still being called a fraud, then it&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>Not necessarily.</p>
<p>It could be that he&rsquo;s not a fraud.</p>
<p>You really are.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, but it&rsquo;s not resonating with you</p>
<p>because your brain knows the logic.</p>
<p>So you can&rsquo;t trick yourself.</p>
<p>But yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t know, this whole trolling thing,</p>
<p>you seem to be much better at seeing it as a game.</p>
<p>You know why?</p>
<p>Because you are under the delusion</p>
<p>that every human being is capable</p>
<p>of intelligent reasoned decisions.</p>
<p>Still think I&rsquo;m right.</p>
<p>And I perceive them as literally animals.</p>
<p>So when a dog starts barking,</p>
<p>all it&rsquo;s saying is that the dog is agitated</p>
<p>and this is not going to change my life one iota</p>
<p>other than crossing the street, perhaps.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m going to prove you wrong one day.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to kill yourself</p>
<p>because they can drive you to it.</p>
<p>The first shoot up of school.</p>
<p>But if I don&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;ll prove you wrong.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll bring the data.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;d be like, you&rsquo;re right, Lex.</p>
<p>I have the receipts.</p>
<p>Okay, so we mentioned Camus.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, I love him.</p>
<p>Is there, this is a question that people like love</p>
<p>when I ask.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a really smart people.</p>
<p>What it is, love?</p>
<p>No, what books, let&rsquo;s say three books,</p>
<p>if you can think of them, technical, fiction,</p>
<p>philosophical, would you, had a big impact on you</p>
<p>or would you recommend to others?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>The Machiavellians by James Burnham.</p>
<p>This is a book about how politics works in reality</p>
<p>as opposed to how people imagine it working.</p>
<p>Mentis Moldbug, who&rsquo;s a figure in these circles,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s respected by a lot of people.</p>
<p>I was giving a talk and there was a bunch of panelists</p>
<p>and we were asked, what book would you recommend?</p>
<p>I said, The Machiavellians.</p>
<p>Independently of me, that was the book he had recommended.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s out of print, it&rsquo;s hard to find,</p>
<p>but that would be one.</p>
<p>Is that his book or no?</p>
<p>James Burnham, it came out in 1941, I think.</p>
<p>So can you pause on the, what&rsquo;s his?</p>
<p>Mentis Moldbug.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a code name, right?</p>
<p>That guy&rsquo;s pen name.</p>
<p>Curtis Yarvin, that&rsquo;s his real name.</p>
<p>He swims in your circles.</p>
<p>Which circles?</p>
<p>He does some kind of programming.</p>
<p>Oh, he&rsquo;s originally a programmer.</p>
<p>Yeah, he comes up as a person that I should talk with</p>
<p>or I should know about, but then I read a few of his things</p>
<p>and they seem quite dangerous.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re very long and verbose,</p>
<p>but I think he&rsquo;s an amazing thinker.</p>
<p>Yeah, but.</p>
<p>But he&rsquo;s the one who had the idea</p>
<p>of sending the tanks to Harvard Yard.</p>
<p>But doesn&rsquo;t he have like,</p>
<p>he has some radical views.</p>
<p>I forget what they are.</p>
<p>Very radical views, yeah, he wants a military coup.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re saying he&rsquo;s a serious thinker</p>
<p>that is worthy of, not worthy.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know that you would enjoy</p>
<p>having a conversation with him.</p>
<p>I think a lot of people enjoy seeing it happen,</p>
<p>but I think it would be a lot of talking past each other</p>
<p>and it would be interesting.</p>
<p>What do you agree?</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t agree with him to watch.</p>
<p>What do you disagree, okay.</p>
<p>What do you agree, what do you disagree with him?</p>
<p>I agree with him that politics has to be looked at</p>
<p>objectively and without kind of an emotional connection</p>
<p>to different schools.</p>
<p>I talk about him a lot in my book on the New Right.</p>
<p>Disagree, I don&rsquo;t think a military coup is a good idea.</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t think anarchism is stable, I disagree.</p>
<p>I mean, me and him, I did a live stream with him</p>
<p>which just dorked out a lot about history</p>
<p>and people who&rsquo;ve fallen in the memory hole.</p>
<p>So, I mean, he&rsquo;s got a lot of writing, so.</p>
<p>So, you know, the sense I got from him</p>
<p>was that if I talk with him,</p>
<p>a lot of people would be upset with me</p>
<p>for giving him a platform.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think he&rsquo;s on that edge</p>
<p>where they want to read him out of</p>
<p>what is acceptable discourse.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s his most controversial,</p>
<p>I mean, you keep mentioning the tanks.</p>
<p>Is that the most controversial viewpoint?</p>
<p>Does he have a race thing?</p>
<p>No, the alt right doesn&rsquo;t particularly like him</p>
<p>in many ways because he&rsquo;s not a big on the race thing.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what would be his most controversial view,</p>
<p>to be honest.</p>
<p>I think because he is radical in terms of his analysis</p>
<p>of culture, anytime someone&rsquo;s a radical,</p>
<p>that is dangerous.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s dangerous.</p>
<p>Okay, book, so that&rsquo;s one.</p>
<p>The Fountainhead.</p>
<p>Which is a, I would say.</p>
<p>Not Atlas Shrugged?</p>
<p>No, and if you read Atlas Shrugged</p>
<p>before reading The Fountainhead,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing yourself an enormous disservice.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t you dare do it.</p>
<p>On the philosophical or because the novel is better?</p>
<p>On every level.</p>
<p>Fountainhead&rsquo;s a better novel.</p>
<p>Fountainhead&rsquo;s superfluous if you read Atlas Shrugged first.</p>
<p>Fountainhead&rsquo;s about psychology and ethics.</p>
<p>It does not have to do with her politics</p>
<p>other than its implications.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s by far the superior book.</p>
<p>The third one.</p>
<p>Ooh, this is a good one question.</p>
<p>Let me see.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so many good books out there that I love.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to, this is not really my third choice,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ll throw it out there because I,</p>
<p>this is such an important worldview,</p>
<p>especially for people on the right.</p>
<p>Are you virtue signaling?</p>
<p>No, this is counter signaling.</p>
<p>Thaddeus Russell&rsquo;s book,</p>
<p>A Renegade History of the United States.</p>
<p>His thesis is that it&rsquo;s the degenerates</p>
<p>that give us all freedom.</p>
<p>And things like prostitutes, things like madams,</p>
<p>things like slaves, things like immigrants,</p>
<p>because they were so low status,</p>
<p>they could get away with things</p>
<p>that then people who are higher status demanded</p>
<p>and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>So I think that thesis,</p>
<p>and it really has extreme consequences in thinking.</p>
<p>And no, Jonathan Haidt, The Righteous Mind.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, those are the four.</p>
<p>Is that his best?</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t read any of his stuff.</p>
<p>The Righteous Mind is the only one you want.</p>
<p>Okay, that was four, but of course.</p>
<p>Forget Thaddeus Russell, put Haidt in there.</p>
<p>Of course he would.</p>
<p>No, forget Thaddeus, those are the three.</p>
<p>So we talked about love.</p>
<p>Let me ask you the other question I&rsquo;m obsessed with.</p>
<p>Are you, do you ponder your own mortality?</p>
<p>I do, a lot, especially now that I&rsquo;m an uncle,</p>
<p>especially now that I have like these younger people</p>
<p>that I mentor.</p>
<p>I was just yesterday, my friend, John Girguis,</p>
<p>who did my theme song for my podcast,</p>
<p>who did the book cover for Dear Reader,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s like the most talented person I know.</p>
<p>His song came on the iPod at the gym</p>
<p>and I almost messaged him.</p>
<p>I go, you know, one day one of us is gonna bury the other</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s gonna be really sad.</p>
<p>And I thought about that and it was kind of like,</p>
<p>oh man, that&rsquo;s really gonna suck.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know which scenario would be better.</p>
<p>Like I will be very sad if he&rsquo;s gone.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;d be very sad if I&rsquo;m gone.</p>
<p>I mean, what do you, are you afraid of it?</p>
<p>No, you know, Rand had this quote about how</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t die, the world will end.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve had enough experiences that I am,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve really, at this point,</p>
<p>and everything&rsquo;s icing on the cake.</p>
<p>So if you, if I were to kill you</p>
<p>at the end of this podcast, it feels painless.</p>
<p>That would be okay?</p>
<p>Yeah, you know why?</p>
<p>Does anyone know you&rsquo;re here by the way?</p>
<p>You know why?</p>
<p>Just asking for a friend.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s why, there&rsquo;s that wit.</p>
<p>Save that for Twitter likes.</p>
<p>Do they call you Sasha?</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m a Lyosha.</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s my sister&rsquo;s husband.</p>
<p>Okay, so here&rsquo;s why.</p>
<p>I strongly believe,</p>
<p>and this is a very kind of Jewish perspective,</p>
<p>that you just have to leave the world</p>
<p>a little bit better than you found it.</p>
<p>That all you could do is move the needle a little.</p>
<p>And one of the things I set out to do</p>
<p>with Dear Reader, my book on North Korea,</p>
<p>I was at a point in my career where I could do something</p>
<p>to make a difference instead of just writing,</p>
<p>like coauthoring books for celebrities,</p>
<p>which I&rsquo;m very proud of, but are neither here nor there.</p>
<p>And I thought, all right, I know how to tell stories,</p>
<p>I know how to inform people, I know how to entertain people.</p>
<p>If I move the needle in America, who cares?</p>
<p>We got it really good here.</p>
<p>If I move the needle in North Korea a little bit,</p>
<p>the cost benefits through the roof.</p>
<p>I never thought of that actually.</p>
<p>I never thought of Dear Reader from that perspective.</p>
<p>So when I set out to write it, I&rsquo;m like, okay,</p>
<p>what can I do?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not gonna be able to liberate the North Korean regime.</p>
<p>What I can do is the camera right now is focused on,</p>
<p>at the time, Kim Jong Il, now Kim Jong Un.</p>
<p>And I can do just this a little bit.</p>
<p>And I go, behind that guy, who you think is funny clown,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s millions of dead people.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s children being starved.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s people who are performing</p>
<p>because they have a gun to their kid&rsquo;s head.</p>
<p>And if someone put a gun to your kid&rsquo;s head,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d put on those dancing shoes real quick.</p>
<p>And I and others have managed to change the conversation</p>
<p>about North Korea in terms of look at those silly buffoons</p>
<p>to those poor people.</p>
<p>So the fact that that little thing I can say</p>
<p>with a straight face, I did,</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t make me a great person,</p>
<p>but it does make me someone who, if I have to go tomorrow,</p>
<p>I can say I did a little bit</p>
<p>to make the world a better place.</p>
<p>What do you think is the meaning of life?</p>
<p>I think the meaning of life is&hellip;</p>
<p>Why are we here?</p>
<p>Oh, well, I&rsquo;m a Camu person.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll give the Camu answer.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s two types of people.</p>
<p>Those who know how to use binary&hellip;</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>Thanks for relating to the audience.</p>
<p>One, one, one, zero, zero, one, two.</p>
<p>Two?</p>
<p>Down vote.</p>
<p>What kind of radical freak is this Lex?</p>
<p>So, and I use this example of my forthcoming book.</p>
<p>You go into a countryside, a mountainside,</p>
<p>and you see a blank canvas on an easel.</p>
<p>And one kind of mentality goes,</p>
<p>this is just a blank canvas.</p>
<p>This is stupid.</p>
<p>This is what am I looking at?</p>
<p>And the other type goes, what a great opportunity.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in this beautiful space.</p>
<p>I have this entire canvas to paint.</p>
<p>I could do anything I want with it.</p>
<p>So I am very much of that type two person.</p>
<p>And I hope others start to think of life in that way.</p>
<p>You and I have both been more successful</p>
<p>than we expected to, especially growing up,</p>
<p>and in ways we did not expect.</p>
<p>And when you&rsquo;re young,</p>
<p>you are so intent on driving the car.</p>
<p>And after a certain point,</p>
<p>you realize it&rsquo;s not about driving the car.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s you&rsquo;re being a surfer,</p>
<p>that you can only control this little board</p>
<p>and you have no idea where the waves will take you.</p>
<p>And sometimes you&rsquo;re gonna fall down</p>
<p>and something&rsquo;s gonna really gonna suck</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re gonna swallow some saltwater.</p>
<p>But at a certain point, you stop trying to drive</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re like, this is freaking awesome</p>
<p>and I have no idea where it&rsquo;s gonna go.</p>
<p>Beautifully put.</p>
<p>I know I speak for a lot of people.</p>
<p>First of all, everyone loves the game you play</p>
<p>on the intranet.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fun.</p>
<p>You make the world not everyone.</p>
<p>Today, oof, they came for me hard.</p>
<p>But it makes the world seem fun.</p>
<p>And especially in this dark time, it&rsquo;s much appreciated.</p>
<p>And we can&rsquo;t wait till the next book</p>
<p>and the many to come</p>
<p>and to hopefully many more Joe Rogan appearances.</p>
<p>You guys do some great magic together.</p>
<p>This is fun.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, you, yeah, you&rsquo;re one of my favorite guests on this show</p>
<p>so I can&rsquo;t wait.</p>
<p>Especially if you can make it before the election.</p>
<p>Thanks so much for making today happen.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad you came down.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re awesome.</p>
<p>Thank you so much.</p>
