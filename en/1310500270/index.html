    <p>If one site is hacked, you can just unleash all hell.</p>
<p>We have stumbled into this new era</p>
<p>of mutually assured digital destruction.</p>
<p>How far are people willing to go?</p>
<p>You can capture their location,</p>
<p>you can capture their contacts</p>
<p>that record their telephone calls, record their camera</p>
<p>without them knowing about it.</p>
<p>Basically, you can put an invisible ankle bracelet</p>
<p>on someone without them knowing.</p>
<p>You could sell that to a zero day broker for $2 million.</p>
<p>The following is a conversation with Nicole Perlroth,</p>
<p>cybersecurity journalist and author</p>
<p>of This Is How They Tell Me The World Ends,</p>
<p>The Cyber Weapons Arm Race.</p>
<p>This is the Lex Friedman podcast.</p>
<p>To support it, please check out our sponsors</p>
<p>in the description.</p>
<p>And now, dear friends, here&rsquo;s Nicole Perlroth.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve interviewed hundreds of cybersecurity hackers,</p>
<p>activists, dissidents, computer scientists,</p>
<p>government officials, forensic investigators,</p>
<p>and mercenaries.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about cybersecurity and cyber war.</p>
<p>Start with the basics.</p>
<p>What is a zero day vulnerability?</p>
<p>And then a zero day exploit or attack?</p>
<p>So at the most basic level, let&rsquo;s say I&rsquo;m a hacker</p>
<p>and I find a bug in your iPhone iOS software</p>
<p>that no one else knows about, especially Apple.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s called a zero day because the minute it&rsquo;s discovered,</p>
<p>engineers have had zero days to fix it.</p>
<p>If I can study that zero day,</p>
<p>I could potentially write a program to exploit it.</p>
<p>And that program would be called a zero day exploit.</p>
<p>And for iOS, the dream is that you craft a zero day exploit</p>
<p>that can remotely exploit someone else&rsquo;s iPhone</p>
<p>without them ever knowing about it.</p>
<p>And you can capture their location,</p>
<p>you can capture their contacts</p>
<p>that record their telephone calls,</p>
<p>record their camera without them knowing about it.</p>
<p>Basically, you can put an invisible ankle bracelet</p>
<p>on someone without them knowing.</p>
<p>And you can see why that capability,</p>
<p>that zero day exploit would have immense value</p>
<p>for a spy agency or a government</p>
<p>that wants to monitor its critics or dissidents.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s a very lucrative market now</p>
<p>for zero day exploits.</p>
<p>So you said a few things there.</p>
<p>One is iOS, why iOS, which operating system,</p>
<p>which one is the sexier thing to try to get to</p>
<p>or the most impactful thing?</p>
<p>And the other thing you mentioned is remote</p>
<p>versus like having to actually come</p>
<p>in physical contact with it.</p>
<p>Is that the distinction?</p>
<p>So iPhone exploits have just been</p>
<p>a government&rsquo;s number one priority.</p>
<p>Recently, actually the price</p>
<p>of an Android remote zero day exploit,</p>
<p>something that can get you into Android phones</p>
<p>is actually higher.</p>
<p>The value of that is now higher on this underground market</p>
<p>for zero day exploits than an iPhone iOS exploit.</p>
<p>So things are changing.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s probably more Android devices,</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s better.</p>
<p>But then the iPhone side,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m an Android person,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m a man of the people.</p>
<p>But it seems like all the elites use iPhone,</p>
<p>all the people at nice dinner parties.</p>
<p>So is that the reason that the more powerful people</p>
<p>use iPhones, is that why?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>
<p>I actually, so it was about two years ago</p>
<p>that the prices flipped.</p>
<p>It used to be that if you could craft</p>
<p>a remote zero click exploit for iOS,</p>
<p>then that was about as good as it gets.</p>
<p>You could sell that to a zero day broker for $2 million.</p>
<p>The caveat is you can never tell anyone about it,</p>
<p>because the minute you tell someone about it,</p>
<p>Apple learns about it,</p>
<p>they patch it in that $2.5 million investment</p>
<p>that that zero day broker just made goes to dust.</p>
<p>So a couple of years ago,</p>
<p>and don&rsquo;t quote me on the prices,</p>
<p>but an Android zero click remote exploit</p>
<p>for the first time topped the iOS.</p>
<p>And actually a lot of people&rsquo;s read on that</p>
<p>was that it might be a sign</p>
<p>that Apple security was falling,</p>
<p>and that it might actually be easier</p>
<p>to find an iOS zero day exploit</p>
<p>than find an Android zero day exploit.</p>
<p>The other thing is market share.</p>
<p>There are just more people around the world that use Android.</p>
<p>And a lot of governments that are paying top dollar</p>
<p>for zero day exploits these days</p>
<p>are deep pocketed governments in the Gulf</p>
<p>that wanna use these exploits</p>
<p>to monitor their own citizens, monitor their critics.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s not necessarily</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re trying to find elites,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s that they wanna find out who these people are</p>
<p>that are criticizing them</p>
<p>or perhaps planning the next Arab Spring.</p>
<p>So in your experience,</p>
<p>are most of these attacks targeted</p>
<p>to cover a large population,</p>
<p>or is there attacks that are targeted</p>
<p>towards specific individuals?</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s both.</p>
<p>Some of the zero day exploits that have fetched top dollar</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve heard of in my reporting in the United States</p>
<p>were highly targeted.</p>
<p>There was a potential terrorist attack.</p>
<p>They wanted to get into this person&rsquo;s phone.</p>
<p>It had to be done in the next 24 hours.</p>
<p>They approached hackers and say, we&rsquo;ll pay you</p>
<p>X millions of dollars if you can do this.</p>
<p>But then you look at,</p>
<p>when we&rsquo;ve discovered iOS zero day exploits in the wild,</p>
<p>some of them have been targeting large populations</p>
<p>like Uyghurs.</p>
<p>So a couple of years ago,</p>
<p>there was a watering hole attack.</p>
<p>Okay, what&rsquo;s a watering hole attack?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a website,</p>
<p>it was actually had information aimed at Uyghurs</p>
<p>and you could access it all over the world.</p>
<p>And if you visited this website,</p>
<p>it would drop an iOS zero day exploit onto your phone.</p>
<p>And so anyone that visited this website</p>
<p>that was about Uyghurs anywhere,</p>
<p>I mean, Uyghurs, Uyghurs living abroad,</p>
<p>basically the Uyghur diaspora would have gotten infected</p>
<p>with this zero day exploit.</p>
<p>So in that case, they were targeting huge swaths</p>
<p>of this one population or people interested</p>
<p>in this one population, basically in real time.</p>
<p>So who are these attackers?</p>
<p>From the individual level to the group level,</p>
<p>psychologically speaking, what&rsquo;s their motivation?</p>
<p>Is it purely money?</p>
<p>Is it the challenge?</p>
<p>Are they malevolent?</p>
<p>Is it power?</p>
<p>These are big philosophical human questions, I guess.</p>
<p>So these are the questions I set out to answer for my book.</p>
<p>I wanted to know, are these people that are just after money?</p>
<p>If they&rsquo;re just after money, how do they sleep at night?</p>
<p>Not knowing whether that zero day exploit</p>
<p>they just sold to a broker is being used</p>
<p>to basically make someone&rsquo;s life a living hell.</p>
<p>And what I found was there&rsquo;s kind of this long sorted history</p>
<p>to this question.</p>
<p>It started out in the 80s and 90s</p>
<p>when hackers were just finding holes and bugs and software</p>
<p>for curiosity&rsquo;s sake, really as a hobby.</p>
<p>And some of them would go to the tech companies</p>
<p>like Microsoft or Sun Microsystems at the time or Oracle.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;d say, hey, I just found this zero day</p>
<p>in your software and I can use it to break into NASA.</p>
<p>And the general response at the time wasn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>thank you so much for pointing out this flaw</p>
<p>and our software, we&rsquo;ll get it fixed as soon as possible.</p>
<p>It was, don&rsquo;t ever poke around our software ever again</p>
<p>or we&rsquo;ll stick our general counsel on you.</p>
<p>And that was really sort of the common thread for years.</p>
<p>And so hackers who set out to do the right thing</p>
<p>were basically told to shut up</p>
<p>and stop doing what you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>And what happened next was they basically started trading</p>
<p>this information online.</p>
<p>Now, when you go back and interview people</p>
<p>from those early days, they all tell a very similar story,</p>
<p>which is they&rsquo;re curious, they&rsquo;re tinkerers.</p>
<p>They remind me of like the kid down the block</p>
<p>that was constantly poking around the hood of his dad&rsquo;s car.</p>
<p>They just couldn&rsquo;t help themselves.</p>
<p>They wanted to figure out how a system is designed</p>
<p>and how they could potentially exploit it</p>
<p>for some other purpose.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t have to be good or bad.</p>
<p>But they were basically kind of beat down for so long</p>
<p>by these big tech companies</p>
<p>that they started just silently trading them</p>
<p>with other hackers.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s how you got these really heated debates</p>
<p>in the 90s about disclosure.</p>
<p>Should you just dump these things online</p>
<p>because any script kitty can pick them up</p>
<p>and use it for all kinds of mischief.</p>
<p>But don&rsquo;t you wanna just stick a middle finger</p>
<p>to all these companies</p>
<p>that are basically threatening you all the time.</p>
<p>So there was this really interesting dynamic at play.</p>
<p>And what I learned in the course of doing my book</p>
<p>was that government agencies and their contractors</p>
<p>sort of tapped into that frustration and that resentment.</p>
<p>And they started quietly reaching out to hackers</p>
<p>on these forums.</p>
<p>And they said, hey, you know that zero day</p>
<p>you just dropped online,</p>
<p>could you come up with something custom for me?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll pay you six figures for it</p>
<p>so long as you shut up and never tell anyone</p>
<p>that I paid you for this.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what happened.</p>
<p>So throughout the 90s,</p>
<p>there was a bunch of boutique contractors</p>
<p>that started reaching out to hackers on these forums</p>
<p>and saying, hey, I&rsquo;ll pay you six figures</p>
<p>for that bug you were trying to get Microsoft</p>
<p>to fix for free.</p>
<p>And sort of so began or so catalyzed this market</p>
<p>where governments and their intermediaries</p>
<p>started reaching out to these hackers</p>
<p>and buying their bugs for free.</p>
<p>And in those early days,</p>
<p>I think a lot of it was just for quiet counterintelligence,</p>
<p>traditional espionage.</p>
<p>But as we started baking the software,</p>
<p>Windows software, Schneider Electric,</p>
<p>Siemens industrial software into our nuclear plants</p>
<p>and our factories and our power grid</p>
<p>and our petrochemical facilities and our pipelines,</p>
<p>those same zero days came to be just as valuable</p>
<p>for sabotage and war planning.</p>
<p>Does the fact that the market sprung up</p>
<p>and you can now make a lot of money</p>
<p>change the nature of the attackers that came to the table</p>
<p>or grow the number of attackers?</p>
<p>I mean, what is, I guess,</p>
<p>you told the psychology of the hackers in the 90s,</p>
<p>what is the culture today and where is it heading?</p>
<p>So I think there are people who will tell you</p>
<p>they would never sell a zero day</p>
<p>to a zero day broker or a government.</p>
<p>One, because they don&rsquo;t know how it&rsquo;s gonna get used</p>
<p>when they throw it over the fence.</p>
<p>Most of these get rolled into classified programs</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t know how they get used.</p>
<p>If you sell it to a zero day broker,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t even know which nation state might use it</p>
<p>or potentially which criminal group might use it</p>
<p>if you sell it on the dark web.</p>
<p>The other thing that they say is that</p>
<p>they wanna be able to sleep at night.</p>
<p>And they lose a lot of sleep</p>
<p>if they found out their zero day was being used</p>
<p>to make a dissident&rsquo;s life living hell.</p>
<p>But there are a lot of people, good people,</p>
<p>who also say, no, this is not my problem.</p>
<p>This is the technology company&rsquo;s problem.</p>
<p>If they weren&rsquo;t writing new bugs</p>
<p>into their software every day,</p>
<p>then there wouldn&rsquo;t be a market.</p>
<p>Then there wouldn&rsquo;t be a problem.</p>
<p>But they continue to write bugs</p>
<p>into their software all the time</p>
<p>and they continue to profit off that software.</p>
<p>So why shouldn&rsquo;t I profit off my labor too?</p>
<p>And one of the things that has happened,</p>
<p>which is I think a positive development</p>
<p>over the last 10 years, are bug bounty programs.</p>
<p>Companies like Google and Facebook</p>
<p>and then Microsoft and finally Apple,</p>
<p>which resisted it for a really long time,</p>
<p>have said, okay, we are gonna shift our perspective</p>
<p>about hackers.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re no longer going to treat them as the enemy here.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to start paying them</p>
<p>for what it&rsquo;s essentially free quality assurance.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re gonna pay them good money in some cases,</p>
<p>six figures in some cases.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re never gonna be able to bid against a zero day broker</p>
<p>who sells to government agencies.</p>
<p>But we can reward them and hopefully get to that bug earlier</p>
<p>where we can neutralize it</p>
<p>so that they don&rsquo;t have to spend another year</p>
<p>developing the zero day exploit.</p>
<p>And in that way, we can keep our software more secure.</p>
<p>But every week I get messages from some hacker that says,</p>
<p>you know, I tried to see this zero day exploit</p>
<p>that was just found in the wild,</p>
<p>being used by this nation state.</p>
<p>I tried to tell Microsoft about this two years ago</p>
<p>and they were gonna pay me peanuts so it never got fixed.</p>
<p>There are all sorts of those stories that can continue on.</p>
<p>And I think just generally,</p>
<p>hackers are not very good at diplomacy.</p>
<p>They tend to be pretty snipey, technical crowd.</p>
<p>And very philosophical in my experience.</p>
<p>But diplomacy is not their strong suit.</p>
<p>Oh, there almost has to be a broker</p>
<p>between companies and hackers.</p>
<p>We can translate effectively,</p>
<p>just like you have a zero day broker</p>
<p>between governments and hackers.</p>
<p>You have to speak their language.</p>
<p>Yeah, and there have been some of those companies</p>
<p>who&rsquo;ve risen up to meet that demand.</p>
<p>And HackerOne is one of them.</p>
<p>Bugcrowd is another.</p>
<p>Cynak has an interesting model, so that&rsquo;s a company</p>
<p>that you pay for a private bug bounty program essentially.</p>
<p>So you pay this company, they tap hackers all over the world</p>
<p>to come hack your software, hack your system.</p>
<p>And then they&rsquo;ll quietly tell you what they found.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s a really positive development.</p>
<p>And actually, the Department of Defense</p>
<p>hired all three of those companies I just mentioned</p>
<p>to help secure their systems.</p>
<p>Now I think they&rsquo;re still a little timid</p>
<p>in terms of letting those hackers</p>
<p>into the really sensitive, high side classified stuff.</p>
<p>But you know, baby steps.</p>
<p>Just to understand what you were saying,</p>
<p>you think it&rsquo;s impossible for companies</p>
<p>to financially compete with the zero day brokers,</p>
<p>with governments.</p>
<p>So like the defense can&rsquo;t outpay the hackers?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting, they shouldn&rsquo;t outpay them.</p>
<p>Because what would happen</p>
<p>if they started offering $2.5 million at Apple</p>
<p>for any zero day exploit</p>
<p>that governments would pay that much for,</p>
<p>is their own engineers would say,</p>
<p>why the hell am I working for less than that</p>
<p>and doing my nine to five every day?</p>
<p>So you would create a perverse incentive.</p>
<p>And I didn&rsquo;t think about that until I started this research</p>
<p>and I realized, okay, yeah, that makes sense.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want to incentivize offense so much</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s to your own detriment.</p>
<p>And so I think what they have though,</p>
<p>what the companies have on government agencies,</p>
<p>is if they pay you, you get to talk about it.</p>
<p>You know, you get the street cred.</p>
<p>You get to brag about the fact you just found</p>
<p>that $2.5 million, you know, iOS zero day</p>
<p>that no one else did.</p>
<p>And if you sell it to a broker,</p>
<p>you never get to talk about it.</p>
<p>And I think that really does eat at people.</p>
<p>Can I ask you a big philosophical question</p>
<p>about human nature here?</p>
<p>So if you have, I mean, what you&rsquo;ve seen,</p>
<p>if a human being has a zero day,</p>
<p>they found a zero day vulnerability that can hack into,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, what&rsquo;s the worst thing you can hack into?</p>
<p>Something that could launch nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>Which percentage of the people in the world</p>
<p>that have the skill would not share that with anyone,</p>
<p>with any bad party?</p>
<p>I guess how many people are completely devoid</p>
<p>of ethical concerns in your sense?</p>
<p>So my belief is all the ultra competent people</p>
<p>or very, very high percentage of ultra competent people</p>
<p>are also ethical people.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s been my experience.</p>
<p>But then again, my experience is narrow.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your experience been like?</p>
<p>So this was another question I wanted to answer.</p>
<p>Who are these people who would sell a zero day exploit</p>
<p>that would neutralize a Schneider Electric safety lock</p>
<p>at a petrochemical plant?</p>
<p>Basically the last thing you would need to neutralize</p>
<p>before you trigger some kind of explosion.</p>
<p>Who would sell that?</p>
<p>And I got my answer,</p>
<p>well, the answer was different.</p>
<p>A lot of people said, I would never even look there</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t even wanna know.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even wanna have that capability.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even wanna have to make that decision</p>
<p>about whether I&rsquo;m gonna profit off of that knowledge.</p>
<p>I went down to Argentina</p>
<p>and this whole kind of moral calculus I had in my head</p>
<p>was completely flipped around.</p>
<p>So just to back up for a moment.</p>
<p>So Argentina actually is a real hacker&rsquo;s paradise.</p>
<p>People grew up in Argentina and I went down there,</p>
<p>I guess I was there around 2015, 2016,</p>
<p>but you still couldn&rsquo;t get an iPhone.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t have Amazon Prime.</p>
<p>You couldn&rsquo;t get access to any of the apps</p>
<p>we all take for granted.</p>
<p>To get those things in Argentina as a kid,</p>
<p>you have to find a way to hack them.</p>
<p>And the whole culture is really like a hacker culture.</p>
<p>They say it&rsquo;s really like a MacGyver culture.</p>
<p>You have to figure out how to break into something</p>
<p>with wire and tape.</p>
<p>And that means that there are a lot of really good hackers</p>
<p>in Argentina who specialize in developing zero to exploits.</p>
<p>And I went down to this Argentina conference</p>
<p>called Echo Party.</p>
<p>And I asked the organizer, okay, can you introduce me</p>
<p>to someone who&rsquo;s selling zero to exploits to governments?</p>
<p>And he was like, just throw a stone.</p>
<p>Throw a stone anywhere and you&rsquo;re gonna hit someone.</p>
<p>And all over this conference, you saw these guys</p>
<p>who were clearly from these Gulf States</p>
<p>who only spoke Arabic.</p>
<p>What are they doing at a young hacking conference</p>
<p>in Buenos Aires?</p>
<p>And so I went out to lunch with kind of this godfather</p>
<p>of the hacking scene there.</p>
<p>And I asked this really dumb question</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m still embarrassed about how I phrased it.</p>
<p>But I said, so will these guys only sell</p>
<p>these zero to exploits to good Western governments?</p>
<p>And he said, Nicole, last time I checked,</p>
<p>the United States wasn&rsquo;t a good Western government.</p>
<p>The last country that bombed another country</p>
<p>into oblivion wasn&rsquo;t China or Iran,</p>
<p>it was the United States.</p>
<p>So if we&rsquo;re gonna go by your whole moral calculus,</p>
<p>just know that we have a very different calculus down here</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;d actually rather sell to Iran or Russia</p>
<p>or China maybe than the United States.</p>
<p>And that just blew me away.</p>
<p>Like, wow, he&rsquo;s like, we&rsquo;ll just sell</p>
<p>to whoever brings us the biggest bag of cash.</p>
<p>Have you checked into our inflation situation recently?</p>
<p>So I had some of those like reality checks along the way.</p>
<p>We tend to think of things as is this moral,</p>
<p>is this ethical, especially as journalists.</p>
<p>And we kind of sit on our high horse sometimes</p>
<p>and write about a lot of things</p>
<p>that seem to push the moral bounds.</p>
<p>But in this market, which is essentially</p>
<p>an underground market that the one rule is like fight club.</p>
<p>No one talks about fight club.</p>
<p>First rule of the zero day market,</p>
<p>nobody talks about the zero day market on both sides</p>
<p>because the hacker doesn&rsquo;t wanna lose</p>
<p>their $2.5 million bounty.</p>
<p>And governments roll these into classified programs</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t want anyone to know what they have.</p>
<p>So no one talks about this thing.</p>
<p>And when you&rsquo;re operating in the dark like that,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really easy to put aside your morals sometimes.</p>
<p>Can I, as a small tangent, ask you, by way of advice,</p>
<p>you must have done some incredible interviews.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ve also spoken about how serious</p>
<p>you take protecting your sources.</p>
<p>If you were to give me advice for interviewing</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re recording on mic with a video camera,</p>
<p>how is it possible to get into this world?</p>
<p>Like is it basically impossible?</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve spoken with a few people,</p>
<p>what is it like the godfather of cyber war, cyber security?</p>
<p>So people that are already out.</p>
<p>And they still have to be pretty brave to speak publicly.</p>
<p>But is it virtually impossible to really talk to anybody</p>
<p>who is a current hacker?</p>
<p>Are you always like 10, 20 years behind?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good question.</p>
<p>And this is why I&rsquo;m a print journalist.</p>
<p>But when I&rsquo;ve seen people do it,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s always the guy who&rsquo;s behind the shadows,</p>
<p>whose voice has been altered.</p>
<p>When they&rsquo;ve gotten someone on camera,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s usually how they do it.</p>
<p>Very, very few people talk in this space.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s actually a pretty well known case study</p>
<p>in why you don&rsquo;t talk publicly in this space</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t get photographed.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the gruck.</p>
<p>So the gruck is or was this zero day broker,</p>
<p>South African guy, lives in Thailand.</p>
<p>And right when I was starting on this subject</p>
<p>at the New York Times, he&rsquo;d given an interview to Forbes.</p>
<p>And he talked about being a zero day broker.</p>
<p>And he even posed next to this giant duffel bag</p>
<p>filled with cash, ostensibly.</p>
<p>And later he would say he was speaking off the record.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t understand the rules of the game.</p>
<p>But what I heard from people who did business with him</p>
<p>was that the minute that that story came out,</p>
<p>he became PNG&rsquo;d.</p>
<p>No one did business with him.</p>
<p>His business plummeted by at least half.</p>
<p>No one wants to do business with anyone</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s going to get on camera and talk</p>
<p>about how they&rsquo;re selling zero days to governments.</p>
<p>It puts you at danger.</p>
<p>And I did hear that he got some visits</p>
<p>from some security folks.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s another thing for these people to consider.</p>
<p>If they have those zero day exploits at their disposal,</p>
<p>they become a huge target for nation states</p>
<p>all over the world.</p>
<p>Talk about having perfect opsec.</p>
<p>You better have some perfect opsec</p>
<p>if people know that you have access to those zero day</p>
<p>exploits.</p>
<p>Which sucks because, I mean, transparency here</p>
<p>would be really powerful for educating the world</p>
<p>and also inspiring other engineers to do good.</p>
<p>It just feels like when you operate in the shadows,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t help us move in the positive direction in terms</p>
<p>of getting more people on the defense side</p>
<p>versus on the attack side.</p>
<p>But of course, what can you do?</p>
<p>I mean, the best you can possibly do</p>
<p>is have great journalists, just like you did,</p>
<p>interview and write books about it,</p>
<p>and integrate the information you get</p>
<p>while hiding the sources.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I think what HackerOne has told me was, OK,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s just put away the people that</p>
<p>are finding and developing zero day exploits all day long.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s put that aside.</p>
<p>What about however many millions of programmers</p>
<p>all over the world who&rsquo;ve never even heard of a zero day</p>
<p>exploit?</p>
<p>Why not tap into them and say, hey, we&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>start paying you if you can find a bug in United Airlines</p>
<p>software or in Schneider Electric or in Ford or Tesla?</p>
<p>And I think that is a really smart approach.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go find this untapped army of programmers</p>
<p>to neutralize these bugs before the people who will continue</p>
<p>to sell these to governments can find them and exploit them.</p>
<p>OK, I have to ask you about this.</p>
<p>From a personal side, it&rsquo;s funny enough,</p>
<p>after we agreed to talk, I&rsquo;ve gotten,</p>
<p>for the first time in my life, was a victim of a cyber attack.</p>
<p>So this is ransomware.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called Deadbolt.</p>
<p>People can look it up.</p>
<p>I have a QNAP device for basically kind</p>
<p>of coldish storage.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s about 60 terabytes with 50 terabytes of data on it</p>
<p>in RAID 5.</p>
<p>And apparently, about 4,000 to 5,000 QNAP devices</p>
<p>were hacked and taken over with this ransomware.</p>
<p>And what ransomware does there is it goes file by file,</p>
<p>almost all the files on the QNAP storage device,</p>
<p>and encrypts them.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s this very eloquently and politely</p>
<p>written page that pops up, describes what happened.</p>
<p>All your files have been encrypted.</p>
<p>This includes but is not limited to photos, documents,</p>
<p>and spreadsheets.</p>
<p>Why me?</p>
<p>This is a lot of people commented</p>
<p>about how friendly and eloquent this is.</p>
<p>And I have to commend them.</p>
<p>It is, and it&rsquo;s pretty user friendly.</p>
<p>Why me?</p>
<p>This is not a personal attack.</p>
<p>You have been targeted because of the inadequate security</p>
<p>provided by your vendor, QNAP.</p>
<p>What now?</p>
<p>You can make a payment of exactly 0.03 Bitcoin,</p>
<p>which is about $1,000, to the following address.</p>
<p>Once the payment has been made, we&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>follow up with transaction to the same address,</p>
<p>blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p>They give you instructions of what happens next,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll give you a decryption key</p>
<p>that you can then use.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s another message for QNAP that says,</p>
<p>all your affected customers have been targeted using</p>
<p>a zero day vulnerability in your product.</p>
<p>We offer you two options to mitigate this and future damage.</p>
<p>One, make a Bitcoin payment of 5 Bitcoin</p>
<p>to the following address, and that</p>
<p>will reveal to QNAP the, I&rsquo;m summarizing things here,</p>
<p>what the actual vulnerability is.</p>
<p>Or you can make a Bitcoin payment of 50 Bitcoin</p>
<p>to get a master decryption key for all your customers.</p>
<p>50 Bitcoin is about $1.8 million.</p>
<p>OK.</p>
<p>So first of all, on a personal level, this one hurt for me.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s, I mean, I learned a lot because I wasn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>for the most part, backing up much of that data</p>
<p>because I thought I can afford to lose that data.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not horrible.</p>
<p>I mean, I think you&rsquo;ve spoken about the crown jewels,</p>
<p>like making sure there&rsquo;s things you really protect.</p>
<p>And I have, you know, I&rsquo;m very conscious,</p>
<p>security wise, on the crown jewels.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a bunch of stuff, like, you know,</p>
<p>personal videos that are not, like,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have anything creepy, but just, like,</p>
<p>fun things I did that because they&rsquo;re very large or 4K</p>
<p>or something like that, I kept them on there,</p>
<p>thinking RAID 5 will protect it.</p>
<p>You know, just I lost a bunch of stuff, including raw footage</p>
<p>from interviews and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s painful.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s a lot of painful stuff</p>
<p>like that for the 4,000 to 5,000 people that use QNAP.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a lot of interesting ethical questions here.</p>
<p>Do you pay them?</p>
<p>Does QNAP pay them?</p>
<p>Do the individuals pay them, especially when</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s going to work or not?</p>
<p>Do you wait?</p>
<p>So QNAP said that, please don&rsquo;t pay them.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re working very hard day and night to solve this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so philosophically interesting to me</p>
<p>because I also project onto them thinking,</p>
<p>what is their motivation?</p>
<p>Because the way they phrased it, on purpose, perhaps,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m not sure if that actually reflects their real motivation,</p>
<p>is maybe they&rsquo;re trying to help themselves sleep at night,</p>
<p>basically saying, this is not about you.</p>
<p>This is about the company with the vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>Just like you mentioned, this is the justification they have.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re hurting real people.</p>
<p>They hurt me.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s a few others that are really hurt.</p>
<p>And the zero day factor is a big one.</p>
<p>Their QNAP right now is trying to figure out</p>
<p>what the hell is wrong with their system that would let this in.</p>
<p>And even if they pay, if they still don&rsquo;t know where the zero</p>
<p>day is, what&rsquo;s to say that they won&rsquo;t just hit them again</p>
<p>and hit you again?</p>
<p>So that really complicates things.</p>
<p>And that is a huge advancement for ransomware.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really only been, I think, in the last 18 months</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve ever really seen ransomware exploit zero days</p>
<p>to pull these off.</p>
<p>Usually, 80% of them, I think the data shows 80% of them</p>
<p>come down to a lack of two factor authentication.</p>
<p>So when someone gets hit by a ransomware attack,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t have two factor authentication on.</p>
<p>Their employees were using stupid passwords.</p>
<p>You can mitigate that in the future.</p>
<p>This one, they don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>They probably don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And I guess it&rsquo;s zero click because I</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t have to do anything.</p>
<p>The only thing, well, here&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>I did basics of I put it behind a firewall.</p>
<p>I followed instructions.</p>
<p>But I didn&rsquo;t really pay attention.</p>
<p>So maybe there&rsquo;s a misconfiguration of some sort</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s easy to make.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s difficult. We have a personal NAS.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not willing to say that I did</p>
<p>everything I possibly could.</p>
<p>But I did a lot of reasonable stuff.</p>
<p>And they still hit it with zero clicks.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t have to do anything.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, it&rsquo;s like a zero day.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a supply chain attack.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re getting hit from your supplier.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re getting hit because of your vendor.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s also a new thing for ransomware groups</p>
<p>to go to the individuals to pressure them to pay.</p>
<p>There was this really interesting case.</p>
<p>I think it was in Norway where there was a mental health</p>
<p>clinic that got hit.</p>
<p>And the cybercriminals were going to the patients</p>
<p>themselves to say, pay this, or we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to release your psychiatric records.</p>
<p>I mean, talk about hell.</p>
<p>In terms of whether to pay, that is on the cheaper</p>
<p>end of the spectrum.</p>
<p>From the individual or from the company?</p>
<p>Both.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve seen, for instance, there was an Apple supplier in Taiwan.</p>
<p>They got hit.</p>
<p>And the ransom demand was $50 million.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m surprised it&rsquo;s only $1.8 million.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s going to go up.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s hard.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s obviously governments, and maybe in this case,</p>
<p>the company are going to tell you,</p>
<p>we recommend you don&rsquo;t pay or please don&rsquo;t pay.</p>
<p>But the reality on the ground is that some businesses</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t operate.</p>
<p>Some countries can&rsquo;t function.</p>
<p>I mean, the underreported storyline of Colonial Pipeline</p>
<p>was after the company got hit and took</p>
<p>the preemptive step of shutting down the pipeline</p>
<p>because their billing systems were frozen,</p>
<p>they couldn&rsquo;t charge customers downstream.</p>
<p>My colleague David Zanger and I got our hands</p>
<p>on a classified assessment that said that as a country,</p>
<p>we could have only afforded two to three more days</p>
<p>of Colonial Pipeline being down.</p>
<p>And it was really interesting.</p>
<p>I thought it was the gas and the jet fuel, but it wasn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>We were sort of prepared for that.</p>
<p>It was the diesel.</p>
<p>Without the diesel, the refineries couldn&rsquo;t function,</p>
<p>and it would have totally screwed up the economy.</p>
<p>And so there was almost this national security</p>
<p>economic impetus for them to pay this ransom.</p>
<p>And the other one I always think about is Baltimore.</p>
<p>When the city of Baltimore got hit,</p>
<p>I think the initial ransom demand</p>
<p>was something around $76,000.</p>
<p>It may have even started smaller than that.</p>
<p>And Baltimore stood its ground and didn&rsquo;t pay.</p>
<p>But ultimately, the cost to remediate was $18 million.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a lot for the city of Baltimore.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s money that could have gone to public school education</p>
<p>and roads and public health.</p>
<p>And instead, it just went to rebuilding these systems</p>
<p>from scratch.</p>
<p>And so a lot of residents in Baltimore</p>
<p>were like, why the hell didn&rsquo;t you pay the $76,000?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not obvious.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy to say, don&rsquo;t pay.</p>
<p>Because why?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re funding their R&amp;D for the next go round.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s too often, it&rsquo;s too complicated.</p>
<p>So on the individual level, just like the way</p>
<p>I feel personally from this attack,</p>
<p>have you talked to people that were kind of victims</p>
<p>in the same way I was, but maybe more dramatic ways or so on,</p>
<p>in the same way that violence hurts people?</p>
<p>How much does this hurt people in your sense</p>
<p>and the way you researched it?</p>
<p>The worst ransomware attack I&rsquo;ve covered on a personal level</p>
<p>was an attack on a hospital in Vermont.</p>
<p>And you think of this as like, OK,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hitting their IT networks.</p>
<p>They should still be able to treat patients.</p>
<p>But it turns out that cancer patients</p>
<p>couldn&rsquo;t get their chemo anymore.</p>
<p>Because the protocol of who gets what is very complicated.</p>
<p>And without it, nurses and doctors couldn&rsquo;t access it.</p>
<p>So they were turning chemo patients away,</p>
<p>cancer patients away.</p>
<p>One nurse told us, I don&rsquo;t know why people</p>
<p>aren&rsquo;t screaming about this, that the only thing I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>seen that even compares to what we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>seeing at this hospital right now</p>
<p>was when I worked in the burn unit</p>
<p>after the Boston Marathon bombing.</p>
<p>They really put it in these super dramatic terms.</p>
<p>And last year there was a report in the Wall Street Journal</p>
<p>where they attributed an infant death to a ransomware attack</p>
<p>because a mom came in and whatever device</p>
<p>they were using to monitor the fetus</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t working because of the ransomware attack.</p>
<p>And so they attributed this infant death</p>
<p>to the ransomware attack.</p>
<p>Now on a bigger scale but less personal,</p>
<p>when there was the NotPetya attack.</p>
<p>So this was an attack by Russia on Ukraine</p>
<p>that came at them through a supplier, a tax software</p>
<p>company in that case, that didn&rsquo;t just</p>
<p>hit any government agency or business in Ukraine</p>
<p>that used this tax software.</p>
<p>It actually hit any business all over the world that</p>
<p>had even a single employee working remotely in Ukraine.</p>
<p>So it hit Maersk, the shipping company, hit Pfizer,</p>
<p>hit FedEx, but the one I will never forget is Merck.</p>
<p>It paralyzed Merck&rsquo;s factories.</p>
<p>I mean, it really created an existential crisis</p>
<p>for the company.</p>
<p>Merck had to tap into the CDC&rsquo;s emergency supplies</p>
<p>of the Gardasil vaccine that year</p>
<p>because their whole vaccine production line had been</p>
<p>paralyzed in that attack.</p>
<p>Imagine if that was going to happen right now</p>
<p>to Pfizer or Moderna or Johnson and Johnson.</p>
<p>Imagine.</p>
<p>I mean, that would really create a global cyber terrorist</p>
<p>attack, essentially.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s almost unintentional.</p>
<p>I thought for a long time, I always</p>
<p>labeled it as collateral damage.</p>
<p>But actually, just today, there was a really impressive threat</p>
<p>researcher at Cisco, which has this threat intelligence</p>
<p>division called Talos, who said, stop calling it</p>
<p>collateral damage.</p>
<p>They could see who was going to get hit before they</p>
<p>deployed that malware.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t collateral damage.</p>
<p>It was intentional.</p>
<p>They meant to hit any business that did business with Ukraine.</p>
<p>It was to send a message to them, too.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s accurate.</p>
<p>I always thought of it as sort of the sloppy collateral</p>
<p>damage, but it definitely made me think.</p>
<p>So how much of this between states</p>
<p>is going to be a part of war, these kinds of attacks</p>
<p>on Ukraine between Russia and US, Russia and China,</p>
<p>China and US?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at China and US.</p>
<p>Do you think China and US are going</p>
<p>to escalate something that would be called a war purely</p>
<p>in the space of cyber?</p>
<p>I believe any geopolitical conflict from now on</p>
<p>is guaranteed to have some cyber element to it.</p>
<p>The Department of Justice recently</p>
<p>declassified a report that said China has been hacking</p>
<p>into our pipelines, and it&rsquo;s not for intellectual property</p>
<p>theft.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s to get a foothold so that if things escalate in Taiwan,</p>
<p>for example, they are where they need</p>
<p>to be to shut our pipelines down.</p>
<p>And we just got a little glimpse of what</p>
<p>that looked like with Colonial Pipeline and the panic buying</p>
<p>and the jet fuel shortages and that assessment I just</p>
<p>mentioned about the diesel.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re there.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve gotten there.</p>
<p>Anytime I read a report about new aggression from fighter</p>
<p>jets, Chinese fighter jets in Taiwan,</p>
<p>or what&rsquo;s happening right now with Russia&rsquo;s buildup</p>
<p>on the Ukraine border, or India, Pakistan,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m always looking at it through a cyber lens.</p>
<p>And it really bothers me that other people aren&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>because there is no way that these governments</p>
<p>and these nation states are not going</p>
<p>to use their access to gain some advantage in those conflicts.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m now in a position where I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>an advisor to the Cybersecurity Infrastructure Security</p>
<p>Agency at DHS.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not saying anything classified here.</p>
<p>But I just think that it&rsquo;s really important</p>
<p>to understand just generally what the collateral damage</p>
<p>could be for American businesses and critical infrastructure</p>
<p>in any of these escalated conflicts around the world.</p>
<p>Because just generally, our adversaries</p>
<p>have learned that they might never</p>
<p>be able to match us in terms of our traditional military</p>
<p>spending on traditional weapons and fighter jets.</p>
<p>But we have a very soft underbelly</p>
<p>when it comes to cyber.</p>
<p>80% or more of America&rsquo;s critical infrastructure,</p>
<p>so pipelines, power grid, nuclear plants, water systems,</p>
<p>is owned and operated by the private sector.</p>
<p>And for the most part, there is nothing out there legislating</p>
<p>that those companies share the fact they&rsquo;ve been breached.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t even have to tell the government they&rsquo;ve been hit.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing mandating that they even</p>
<p>meet a bare minimum standard of cybersecurity.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>So even when there are these attacks, most of the time,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t even know about it.</p>
<p>So that is, if you were going to design a system</p>
<p>to be as blind and vulnerable as possible,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s pretty good.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what it looks like is what we have here</p>
<p>in the United States.</p>
<p>And everyone here is just operating like,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s just keep hooking up everything for convenience.</p>
<p>Software eats the world.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just keep going for cost, for convenience sake,</p>
<p>just because we can.</p>
<p>And when you study these issues and you study these attacks</p>
<p>and you study the advancement and the uptick in frequency</p>
<p>and the lower barrier to entry that we see every single year,</p>
<p>you realize just how dumb software eats world is.</p>
<p>And no one has ever stopped to pause and think,</p>
<p>should we be hooking up these systems to the internet?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve just been saying, can we?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s do it.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a real problem.</p>
<p>And just in the last year, we&rsquo;ve seen a record number</p>
<p>of zero day attacks.</p>
<p>I think there were 80 last year, which</p>
<p>is probably more than double what it was in 2019.</p>
<p>A lot of those were nation states.</p>
<p>We live in a world with a lot of geopolitical hot points</p>
<p>right now.</p>
<p>And where those geopolitical hot points are</p>
<p>are places where countries have been investing heavily</p>
<p>in offensive cyber tools.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a nation state, the goal</p>
<p>would be to maximize the footprint of zero day,</p>
<p>like super secret zero day that nobody is aware of.</p>
<p>And whenever war is initiated, the huge negative effects</p>
<p>of shutting down infrastructure or any kind of zero day</p>
<p>is the chaos it creates.</p>
<p>So if you just, there&rsquo;s a certain threshold</p>
<p>when you create the chaos.</p>
<p>The market&rsquo;s plummeted.</p>
<p>Just everything goes to hell.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s not just zero days.</p>
<p>We make it so easy for threat actors.</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;re not using two factor authentication.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not patching.</p>
<p>There was the shell shock vulnerability</p>
<p>that was discovered a couple of years ago.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s still being exploited because so many people</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t fixed it.</p>
<p>So the zero days are really the sexy stuff.</p>
<p>And what really drew me to the zero day market</p>
<p>was the moral calculus we talked about, particularly</p>
<p>from the US government&rsquo;s point of view.</p>
<p>How do they justify leaving these systems so vulnerable</p>
<p>when we use them here and we&rsquo;re baking</p>
<p>more of our critical infrastructure</p>
<p>with this vulnerable software?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like we&rsquo;re using one set of technology</p>
<p>and Russia is using another and China is using this.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re all using the same technology.</p>
<p>So when you find a zero day in Windows,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not just leaving it open so you can spy on Russia</p>
<p>or implant yourself in the Russian grid.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re leaving Americans vulnerable too.</p>
<p>But zero days are like, that is the secret sauce.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the superpower.</p>
<p>And I always say every country now,</p>
<p>with the exception of Antarctica,</p>
<p>someone added the Vatican to my list,</p>
<p>is trying to find offensive hacking tools and zero days</p>
<p>to make them work.</p>
<p>And those that don&rsquo;t have the skills</p>
<p>now have this market that they can tap into,</p>
<p>where $2.5 million, that&rsquo;s chump change</p>
<p>for a lot of these nation states.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a hell of a lot less than trying</p>
<p>to build the next fighter jet.</p>
<p>But yeah, the goal is chaos.</p>
<p>I mean, why did Russia turn off the lights twice in Ukraine?</p>
<p>I think part of it is chaos.</p>
<p>I think part of it is to sow the seeds of doubt</p>
<p>in their current government.</p>
<p>Your government can&rsquo;t even keep your lights on.</p>
<p>Why are you sticking with them?</p>
<p>Come over here and we&rsquo;ll keep your lights on at least.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s like a little bit of that.</p>
<p>Nuclear weapons seems to have helped prevent nuclear war.</p>
<p>Is it possible that we have so many vulnerabilities</p>
<p>and so many attack vectors on each other</p>
<p>that you will kind of achieve the same kind of equilibrium</p>
<p>like mutually shared destruction?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one hopeful solution to this.</p>
<p>Do you have any hope for this particular solution?</p>
<p>You know, nuclear analogies always tend to fall apart</p>
<p>when it comes to cyber,</p>
<p>mainly because you don&rsquo;t need fissile material.</p>
<p>You know, you just need a laptop and the skills</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re in the game.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a really low barrier to entry.</p>
<p>The other thing is attribution is harder.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve seen countries muck around with attribution.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve seen, you know, nation states piggyback</p>
<p>on other countries spy operations and just sit there</p>
<p>and siphon out whatever they&rsquo;re getting.</p>
<p>We learned some of that from the Snowden documents.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve seen Russia hack into Iran&rsquo;s command</p>
<p>and control attack servers.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve seen them hit a Saudi petrochemical plant</p>
<p>where they did neutralize the safety locks at the plant</p>
<p>and everyone assumed that it was Iran,</p>
<p>given Iran had been targeting Saudi oil companies forever.</p>
<p>But nope, it turned out that it was</p>
<p>a graduate research institute outside Moscow.</p>
<p>So you see countries kind of playing around</p>
<p>with attribution.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>I think because they think, okay, if I do this,</p>
<p>like how am I gonna cover up that it came from me</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t wanna risk the response.</p>
<p>So people are sort of dancing around this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just in a very different way.</p>
<p>And, you know, at the times I&rsquo;d covered the Chinese hacks</p>
<p>of infrastructure companies like pipelines.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d covered the Russian probes of nuclear plants.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d covered the Russian attacks on the Ukraine grid.</p>
<p>And then in 2018, my colleague David Sanger and I</p>
<p>covered the fact that US Cyber Command</p>
<p>had been hacking into the Russian grid</p>
<p>and making a pretty loud show of it.</p>
<p>And when we went to the National Security Council,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s what journalists do</p>
<p>before they publish a story,</p>
<p>they give the other side a chance to respond,</p>
<p>I assumed we would be in for that really awkward,</p>
<p>painful conversation where they would say,</p>
<p>you will have blood on your hands if you publish this story.</p>
<p>And instead they gave us the opposite answer.</p>
<p>They said, we have no problem</p>
<p>with you publishing this story.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Well, they didn&rsquo;t say it out loud,</p>
<p>but it was pretty obvious they wanted Russia to know</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re hacking into their power grid too,</p>
<p>and they better think twice before they do to us</p>
<p>what they had done to Ukraine.</p>
<p>So yeah, you know, we have stumbled into this new era</p>
<p>of mutually assured digital destruction.</p>
<p>I think another sort of quasi norm we&rsquo;ve stumbled into</p>
<p>is proportional responses.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s this idea that if you get hit,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re allowed to respond proportionally</p>
<p>at a time and place of your choosing.</p>
<p>That is how the language always goes.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what Obama said after North Korea hit Sony.</p>
<p>We will respond at a time and place of our choosing.</p>
<p>But no one really knows like what that response looks like.</p>
<p>And so what you see a lot of the time</p>
<p>are just these like, just short of war attacks.</p>
<p>You know, Russia turned off the power in Ukraine,</p>
<p>but it wasn&rsquo;t like it stayed off for a week.</p>
<p>You know, it stayed off for a number of hours.</p>
<p>You know, NotPetya hit those companies pretty hard,</p>
<p>but no one died, you know?</p>
<p>And the question is, what&rsquo;s gonna happen when someone dies?</p>
<p>And can a nation state masquerade as a cyber criminal group,</p>
<p>as a ransomware group?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what really complicates</p>
<p>coming to some sort of digital Geneva convention.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s been a push from Brad Smith at Microsoft.</p>
<p>We need a digital Geneva convention.</p>
<p>And on its face, it sounds like a no brainer.</p>
<p>Yeah, why wouldn&rsquo;t we all agree to stop hacking</p>
<p>into each other&rsquo;s civilian hospital systems,</p>
<p>elections, power grid, pipelines?</p>
<p>But when you talk to people in the West,</p>
<p>officials in the West, they&rsquo;ll say, we would never,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;d love to agree to it, but we&rsquo;d never do it</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re dealing with Xi or Putin or Kim Jong Un.</p>
<p>Because a lot of times, they outsource these operations</p>
<p>to cyber criminals.</p>
<p>In China, we see a lot of these attacks</p>
<p>come from this loose satellite network of private citizens</p>
<p>that work at the behest of the Ministry of State Security.</p>
<p>So how do you come to some sort of state to state agreement</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re dealing with transnational actors</p>
<p>and cyber criminals, where it&rsquo;s really hard to pin down</p>
<p>whether that person was acting alone</p>
<p>or whether they were acting at the behest of the MSS</p>
<p>or the FSB.</p>
<p>And a couple of years ago, I remember,</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t remember if it was before or after NotPetya,</p>
<p>but Putin said, hackers are like artists</p>
<p>who wake up in the morning in a good mood and start painting.</p>
<p>In other words, I have no say over what they do or don&rsquo;t do.</p>
<p>So how do you come to some kind of norm</p>
<p>when that&rsquo;s how he&rsquo;s talking about these issues</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s just decimated Merck and Pfizer</p>
<p>and another however many thousand companies?</p>
<p>That is the fundamental difference between nuclear weapons</p>
<p>and cyber attacks is the attribution</p>
<p>or one of the fundamental differences.</p>
<p>If you can fix one thing in the world</p>
<p>in terms of cybersecurity</p>
<p>that would make the world a better place,</p>
<p>what would you fix?</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re not allowed to fix like authoritarian regimes</p>
<p>and you can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>You have to keep that,</p>
<p>you have to keep human nature as it is.</p>
<p>In terms of on the security side, technologically speaking,</p>
<p>you mentioned there&rsquo;s no regulation</p>
<p>on companies in United States.</p>
<p>What if you could just fix with the snap of a finger,</p>
<p>what would you fix?</p>
<p>Two factor authentication, multifactor authentication.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s ridiculous how many of these attacks come in</p>
<p>because someone didn&rsquo;t turn on multifactor authentication.</p>
<p>I mean, Colonial Pipeline, okay?</p>
<p>They took down the biggest conduit</p>
<p>for gas, jet fuel and diesel</p>
<p>to the East Coast of the United States of America, how?</p>
<p>Because they forgot to deactivate an old employee account</p>
<p>whose password had been traded on the dark web</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;d never turned on two factor authentication.</p>
<p>This water treatment facility outside Florida</p>
<p>was hacked last year.</p>
<p>How did it happen?</p>
<p>They were using Windows XP from like a decade ago</p>
<p>that can&rsquo;t even get patches if you want it to</p>
<p>and they didn&rsquo;t have two factor authentication.</p>
<p>Time and time again,</p>
<p>if they just switched on two factor authentication,</p>
<p>some of these attacks wouldn&rsquo;t have been possible.</p>
<p>Now, if I could snap my fingers,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the thing I would do right now.</p>
<p>But of course, this is a cat and mouse game</p>
<p>and then the attackers onto the next thing.</p>
<p>But I think right now that is like bar none.</p>
<p>That is just, that is the easiest, simplest way</p>
<p>to deflect the most attacks.</p>
<p>And the name of the game right now isn&rsquo;t perfect security.</p>
<p>Perfect security is impossible.</p>
<p>They will always find a way in.</p>
<p>The name of the game right now</p>
<p>is make yourself a little bit harder to attack</p>
<p>than your competitor than anyone else out there</p>
<p>so that they just give up and move along.</p>
<p>And maybe if you are a target</p>
<p>for an advanced nation state or the SVR,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna get hacked no matter what.</p>
<p>But you can make cyber criminal groups deadbolt, is it?</p>
<p>You can make their jobs a lot harder</p>
<p>simply by doing the bare basics.</p>
<p>And the other thing is stop reusing your passwords.</p>
<p>But if I only get one, then two factor authentication.</p>
<p>So what is two factor authentication?</p>
<p>Factor one is what, logging in with a password.</p>
<p>And factor two is like have another device</p>
<p>or another channel through which you can confirm,</p>
<p>yeah, that&rsquo;s me.</p>
<p>Yes, usually this happens through some kind of text.</p>
<p>You get your one time code from Bank of America</p>
<p>or from Google.</p>
<p>The better way to do it is spend $20</p>
<p>buying yourself a Fido key on Amazon.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a hardware device.</p>
<p>And if you don&rsquo;t have that hardware device with you,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re not gonna get in.</p>
<p>And the whole goal is, I mean, basically,</p>
<p>my first half of my decade at The Times</p>
<p>was spent covering like the copy.</p>
<p>It was like Home Depot got breached,</p>
<p>News at 11, Target, Neumann Marcus,</p>
<p>like who wasn&rsquo;t hacked over the course of those five years?</p>
<p>And a lot of those companies that got hacked,</p>
<p>what did hackers take?</p>
<p>They took the credentials, they took the passwords.</p>
<p>They can make a pretty penny selling them on the dark web</p>
<p>and people reuse their passwords.</p>
<p>So you get one from God knows who, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>LastPass, worst case example, actually LastPass.</p>
<p>But you get one and then you go test it</p>
<p>on their email account.</p>
<p>And you go test it on their brokerage account</p>
<p>and you test it on their cold storage account.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how it works.</p>
<p>But if you have multi factor authentication,</p>
<p>then they can&rsquo;t get in</p>
<p>because they might have your password,</p>
<p>but they don&rsquo;t have your phone,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t have your Fido key.</p>
<p>So you keep them out.</p>
<p>And I get a lot of alerts that tell me</p>
<p>someone is trying to get into your Instagram account</p>
<p>or your Twitter account or your email account.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t worry because I use multi factor authentication.</p>
<p>They can try all day.</p>
<p>Okay, I worry a little bit, but it&rsquo;s the simplest thing to do</p>
<p>and we don&rsquo;t even do it.</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s an interface aspect to it</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s pretty annoying if it&rsquo;s implemented poorly.</p>
<p>So actually bad implementation</p>
<p>of two factor authentication, not just bad,</p>
<p>but just something that adds friction</p>
<p>is a security vulnerability, I guess,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s really annoying.</p>
<p>Like I think MIT for a while had two factor authentication.</p>
<p>It was really annoying.</p>
<p>I just, like the number of times it pings you,</p>
<p>like it asks to reauthenticate across multiple subdomains.</p>
<p>Like it just feels like a pain.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what the right balance there.</p>
<p>Yeah, it feels like friction in our frictionless society.</p>
<p>It feels like friction, it&rsquo;s annoying.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s security&rsquo;s biggest problem, it&rsquo;s annoying.</p>
<p>We need the Steve Jobs of security to come along</p>
<p>and we need to make it painless.</p>
<p>And actually on that point,</p>
<p>Apple has probably done more for security than anyone else</p>
<p>simply by introducing biometric authentication,</p>
<p>first with the fingerprint and then with face ID.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not perfect, but if you think just eight years ago,</p>
<p>everyone was running around with either no passcode</p>
<p>and optional passcode or four digit passcode on their phone</p>
<p>that anyone, think of what you can get</p>
<p>when you get someone&rsquo;s iPhone, if you steal someone&rsquo;s iPhone</p>
<p>and props to them for introducing the fingerprint</p>
<p>and face ID.</p>
<p>And again, it wasn&rsquo;t perfect, but it was a huge step forward.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s time to make another huge step forward.</p>
<p>I wanna see the password die.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s gotten us as far as it was ever gonna get us.</p>
<p>And I hope whatever we come up with next</p>
<p>is not gonna be annoying, is gonna be seamless.</p>
<p>When I was at Google, that&rsquo;s what we worked on is,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a lot of ways to call it</p>
<p>active authentication, passive authentication.</p>
<p>So basically you use biometric data,</p>
<p>not just like a fingerprint, but everything from your body</p>
<p>to identify who you are, like movement patterns.</p>
<p>So it basically create a lot of layers of protection</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s very difficult to fake,</p>
<p>including like face unlock, checking that it&rsquo;s your actual</p>
<p>face, like the liveness tests.</p>
<p>So like from video, so unlocking it with video,</p>
<p>voice, the way you move the phone,</p>
<p>the way you take it out of the pocket, that kind of thing.</p>
<p>All of those factors.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a really hard problem though.</p>
<p>And ultimately, it&rsquo;s very difficult to beat the password</p>
<p>in terms of security.</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s a company that I actually will call out</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s Abnormal Security.</p>
<p>So they work on email attacks.</p>
<p>And it was started by a couple of guys who were doing,</p>
<p>I think, ad tech at Twitter.</p>
<p>So ad technology now, like it&rsquo;s a joke</p>
<p>how much they know about us.</p>
<p>You always hear the conspiracy theories that</p>
<p>you saw someone&rsquo;s shoes and next thing you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s on your phone.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s amazing what they know about you.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re basically taking that</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re applying it to attacks.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re saying, okay, if you&rsquo;re,</p>
<p>this is what your email patterns are.</p>
<p>It might be different for you and me</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re emailing strangers all the time.</p>
<p>But for most people,</p>
<p>their email patterns are pretty predictable.</p>
<p>And if something strays from that pattern, that&rsquo;s abnormal</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll block it, they&rsquo;ll investigate it.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start using that kind of targeted ad technology</p>
<p>to protect people.</p>
<p>And yeah, I mean, it&rsquo;s not gonna get us away</p>
<p>from the password and using multifactor authentication,</p>
<p>but the technology is out there</p>
<p>and we just have to figure out how to use it</p>
<p>in a really seamless way because it doesn&rsquo;t matter</p>
<p>if you have the perfect security solution</p>
<p>if no one uses it.</p>
<p>I mean, when I started at the times</p>
<p>when I was trying to be really good</p>
<p>about protecting sources,</p>
<p>I was trying to use PGP encryption</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like, it didn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>The number of mistakes I would probably make</p>
<p>just trying to email someone with PGP just wasn&rsquo;t worth it.</p>
<p>And then Signal came along and Signal made it wicker.</p>
<p>They made it a lot easier</p>
<p>to send someone an encrypted text message.</p>
<p>So we have to start investing in creative minds,</p>
<p>in good security design.</p>
<p>I really think that&rsquo;s the hack that&rsquo;s gonna get us</p>
<p>out of where we are today.</p>
<p>What about social engineering?</p>
<p>Do you worry about this sort of hacking people?</p>
<p>Yes, I mean, this is the worst nightmare</p>
<p>of every chief information security officer out there.</p>
<p>Social engineering, we work from home now.</p>
<p>I saw this woman posted online about how her husband,</p>
<p>it went viral today,</p>
<p>but it was her husband had this problem at work.</p>
<p>They hired a guy named John</p>
<p>and now the guy that shows up for work every day</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t act like John.</p>
<p>I mean, think about that.</p>
<p>Like think about the potential for social engineering</p>
<p>in that context.</p>
<p>You apply for a job and you put on a pretty face,</p>
<p>you hire an actor or something,</p>
<p>and then you just get inside the organization</p>
<p>and get access to all that organization&rsquo;s data.</p>
<p>A couple of years ago,</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia planted spies inside Twitter.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Probably because they were trying to figure out</p>
<p>who these people were</p>
<p>who were criticizing the regime on Twitter.</p>
<p>They couldn&rsquo;t do it with a hack from the outside,</p>
<p>so why not plant people on the inside?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s like the worst nightmare.</p>
<p>And it also, unfortunately, creates all kinds of xenophobia</p>
<p>at a lot of these organizations.</p>
<p>I mean, if you&rsquo;re gonna have to take that into consideration,</p>
<p>then organizations are gonna start looking</p>
<p>really skeptically and suspiciously</p>
<p>at someone who applies for that job from China.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve seen that go really badly</p>
<p>at places like the Department of Commerce,</p>
<p>where they basically accuse people of being spies</p>
<p>that aren&rsquo;t spies.</p>
<p>So it is the hardest problem to solve,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s never been harder to solve</p>
<p>than right at this very moment</p>
<p>when there&rsquo;s so much pressure for companies</p>
<p>to let people work remotely.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s actually why I&rsquo;m single.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m suspicious that China and Russia,</p>
<p>every time I meet somebody,</p>
<p>are trying to plant and get insider information,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m very, very suspicious.</p>
<p>I keep putting the touring test in front, no.</p>
<p>No, I have a friend who worked inside NSA</p>
<p>and was one of their top hackers,</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s like, every time I go to Russia,</p>
<p>I get hit on by these 10s.</p>
<p>And I come home, my friends are like,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, you&rsquo;re not a 10.</p>
<p>Like, it&rsquo;s a common story.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s difficult to trust humans</p>
<p>in this day and age online.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re working remotely, that&rsquo;s one thing,</p>
<p>but just interacting with people on the internet,</p>
<p>sounds ridiculous, but because of this podcast in part,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve gotten to meet some incredible people,</p>
<p>but it makes you nervous to trust folks,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t know how to solve that problem.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m talking with Mark Zuckerberg,</p>
<p>who dreams about creating the metaverse.</p>
<p>What do you do about that world</p>
<p>where more and more our lives is in the digital sphere?</p>
<p>Like, one way to phrase it is,</p>
<p>most of our meaningful experiences at some point</p>
<p>will be online, like falling in love, getting a job,</p>
<p>or experiencing a moment of happiness with a friend,</p>
<p>with a new friend made online, all of those things.</p>
<p>Like, more and more, the fun we do,</p>
<p>the things that make us love life will happen online,</p>
<p>and if those things have an avatar that&rsquo;s digital,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like a way to hack into people&rsquo;s minds,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s with AI or kind of troll farms</p>
<p>or something like that.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if there&rsquo;s a way to protect against that.</p>
<p>That might fundamentally rely on our faith</p>
<p>in how good human nature is.</p>
<p>So if most people are good, we&rsquo;re going to be okay,</p>
<p>but if people will tend towards manipulation</p>
<p>and malevolent behavior in search of power,</p>
<p>then we&rsquo;re screwed.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know if you can comment</p>
<p>on how to keep the metaverse secure.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, all I thought about</p>
<p>when you were talking just now was my three year old son.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>He asked me the other day, what&rsquo;s the internet, mom?</p>
<p>And I just almost wanted to cry.</p>
<p>You know, I don&rsquo;t want that for him.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want all of his most meaningful experiences</p>
<p>to be online.</p>
<p>You know, by the time that happens,</p>
<p>how do you know that person&rsquo;s human,</p>
<p>that avatar&rsquo;s human?</p>
<p>You know, I believe in free speech.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe in free speech for robots and bots.</p>
<p>And like, look what just happened over the last six years.</p>
<p>You know, we had bots pretending</p>
<p>to be Black Lives Matter activists</p>
<p>just to sow some division,</p>
<p>or, you know, Texas secessionists,</p>
<p>or, you know, organizing anti Hillary protests,</p>
<p>or just to sow more division,</p>
<p>to tie us up in our own politics</p>
<p>so that we&rsquo;re so paralyzed we can&rsquo;t get anything done.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t make any progress</p>
<p>and we definitely can&rsquo;t handle our adversaries</p>
<p>and their longterm thinking.</p>
<p>It really scares me.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s where I just come back to.</p>
<p>Just because we can create the metaverse,</p>
<p>you know, just because it sounds like the next logical step</p>
<p>in our digital revolution,</p>
<p>do I really want my child&rsquo;s most significant moments</p>
<p>to be online?</p>
<p>They weren&rsquo;t for me, you know?</p>
<p>So maybe I&rsquo;m just stuck in that old school thinking,</p>
<p>or maybe I&rsquo;ve seen too much.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m really sick of being</p>
<p>the guinea pig parent generation for these things.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s hard enough with screen time.</p>
<p>Like thinking about how to manage the metaverse as a parent</p>
<p>to a young boy, like I can&rsquo;t even let my head go there.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s so terrifying for me.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;ve never stopped any new technology</p>
<p>just because it introduces risks.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve always said, okay, the promise of this technology</p>
<p>means we should keep going, keep pressing ahead.</p>
<p>We just need to figure out new ways to manage that risk.</p>
<p>And you know, that&rsquo;s the blockchain right now.</p>
<p>Like when I was covering all of these ransomware attacks,</p>
<p>I thought, okay, this is gonna be it for cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>You know, governments are gonna put the kibosh down.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re gonna put the hammer down and say enough is enough.</p>
<p>Like we have to put this genie back in the bottle</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s enabled ransomware.</p>
<p>I mean, five years ago, they would hijack your PC</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;d say, go to the local pharmacy,</p>
<p>get a eGift card and tell us what the pin is.</p>
<p>And then we&rsquo;ll get your $200.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s pay us, you know, five Bitcoin.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s no doubt cryptocurrencies</p>
<p>enabled ransomware attacks,</p>
<p>but after the Colonial Pipeline ransom was seized,</p>
<p>because if you remember, the FBI was actually able to go in</p>
<p>and claw some of it back from DarkSide,</p>
<p>which was the ransomware group that hid it.</p>
<p>And I spoke to these guys at TRM Labs.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re one of these blockchain intelligence companies.</p>
<p>And a lot of people that work there</p>
<p>used to work at the treasury.</p>
<p>And what they said to me was,</p>
<p>yeah, cryptocurrency has enabled ransomware,</p>
<p>but to track down that ransom payment would have taken,</p>
<p>you know, if we were dealing with fiat currency,</p>
<p>would have taken us years to get to that one bank account</p>
<p>or belonging to that one front company in the Seychelles.</p>
<p>And now thanks to the blockchain,</p>
<p>we can track the movement of those funds in real time.</p>
<p>And you know what?</p>
<p>You know, these payments are not as anonymous</p>
<p>as people think.</p>
<p>Like we still can use our old hacking ways and zero days</p>
<p>and, you know, old school intelligence methods</p>
<p>to find out who owns that private wallet</p>
<p>and how to get to it.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a curse in some ways and that it&rsquo;s an enabler,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also a blessing.</p>
<p>And they said that same thing to me</p>
<p>that I just said to you.</p>
<p>They said, we&rsquo;ve never shut down a promising new technology</p>
<p>because it introduced risk.</p>
<p>We just figured out how to manage that risk.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s where the conversation</p>
<p>unfortunately has to go,</p>
<p>is how do we in the metaverse use technology to fix things?</p>
<p>So maybe we&rsquo;ll finally be able to, not finally,</p>
<p>but figure out a way to solve the identity problem</p>
<p>on the internet, meaning like a blue check mark</p>
<p>for actual human and connect it to identity</p>
<p>or like a fingerprint so you can prove your you.</p>
<p>And yet do it in a way that doesn&rsquo;t involve the company</p>
<p>having all your data.</p>
<p>So giving you, allowing you to maintain control</p>
<p>over your data, or if you don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>then there&rsquo;s a complete transparency</p>
<p>of how that data is being used, all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>And maybe as you educate more and more people,</p>
<p>they would demand in a capitalist society</p>
<p>that the companies that they give their data to</p>
<p>will respect that data.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, there is this company,</p>
<p>and I hope they succeed, their name&rsquo;s PII Ono, Piano.</p>
<p>And they wanna create a vault for your personal information</p>
<p>inside every organization.</p>
<p>And ultimately, if I&rsquo;m gonna call Delta Airlines</p>
<p>to book a flight,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t need to know my social security number.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t need to know my birth date.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just gonna send me a one time token to my phone.</p>
<p>My phone&rsquo;s gonna say, or my Fido key is gonna say,</p>
<p>yep, it&rsquo;s her.</p>
<p>And then we&rsquo;re gonna talk about my identity like a token,</p>
<p>some random token.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t need to know exactly who I am.</p>
<p>They just need to know the system trust that I am,</p>
<p>who I say I am, but they don&rsquo;t get access to my PII data.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t get access to my social security number,</p>
<p>my location, or the fact I&rsquo;m a Times journalist.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s the way the world&rsquo;s gonna go.</p>
<p>We have, enough is enough on sort of</p>
<p>losing our personal information everywhere,</p>
<p>letting data marketing companies track our every move.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t need to know who I am.</p>
<p>Okay, I get it.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re stuck in this world where the internet runs on ads.</p>
<p>So ads are not gonna go away,</p>
<p>but they don&rsquo;t need to know I&rsquo;m Nicole Perlora.</p>
<p>They can know that I am token number, you know,</p>
<p>X567.</p>
<p>And they can let you know what they know</p>
<p>and give you control about removing the things they know.</p>
<p>Yeah, right to be forgotten.</p>
<p>To me, you should be able to walk away</p>
<p>with a single press of a button.</p>
<p>And I also believe that most people,</p>
<p>given the choice to walk away, won&rsquo;t walk away.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll just feel better about having the option</p>
<p>to walk away when they understand the trade offs.</p>
<p>If you walk away, you&rsquo;re not gonna get</p>
<p>some of the personalized experiences</p>
<p>that you would otherwise get,</p>
<p>like a personalized feed and all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>But the freedom to walk away is,</p>
<p>I think, really powerful.</p>
<p>And obviously, what you&rsquo;re saying,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s definitely, there&rsquo;s all of these HTML forms</p>
<p>where you have to enter your phone number and email</p>
<p>and private information from Delta, every single airline.</p>
<p>New York Times.</p>
<p>I have so many opinions on this.</p>
<p>Just the friction and the sign up</p>
<p>and all of those kinds of things.</p>
<p>I should be able to, this has to do with everything.</p>
<p>This has to do with payment, too.</p>
<p>Payment should be trivial.</p>
<p>It should be one click,</p>
<p>and one click to unsubscribe and subscribe,</p>
<p>and one click to provide all of your information</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s necessary for the subscription service,</p>
<p>for the transaction service, whatever that is,</p>
<p>getting a ticket, as opposed to,</p>
<p>I have all of these fake phone numbers and emails</p>
<p>that I use in Alta Sign Up,</p>
<p>because you never know if one site is hacked,</p>
<p>then it&rsquo;s just going to propagate to everything else.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s low hanging fruit,</p>
<p>and I hope Congress does something.</p>
<p>And frankly, I think it&rsquo;s negligent they haven&rsquo;t</p>
<p>on the fact that elderly people are getting spammed to death</p>
<p>on their phones these days with fake car warranty scams.</p>
<p>And I mean, my dad was in the hospital last year,</p>
<p>and I was in the hospital room, and his phone kept buzzing,</p>
<p>and I look at it, and it&rsquo;s just spam attack after spam attack,</p>
<p>people nonstop calling about his freaking car warranty,</p>
<p>why they&rsquo;re trying to get his social security number,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re trying to get his PII,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re trying to get this information.</p>
<p>We need to figure out how to put those people</p>
<p>in jail for life, and we need to figure out</p>
<p>why in the hell we are being required</p>
<p>or asked to hand over our social security number</p>
<p>and our home address and our passport,</p>
<p>all of that information to every retailer who asks.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s insanity.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s no question they&rsquo;re not protecting it</p>
<p>because it keeps showing up in spam or identity theft</p>
<p>or credit card theft or worse.</p>
<p>Well, spam is getting better, and maybe I need to,</p>
<p>as a side note, make a public announcement.</p>
<p>Please clip this out, which is if you get an email</p>
<p>or a message from Lex Friedman saying how much</p>
<p>I, Lex, appreciate you and love you and so on,</p>
<p>and please connect with me on my WhatsApp number</p>
<p>and I will give you Bitcoin or something like that,</p>
<p>please do not click.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m aware that there&rsquo;s a lot of this going on,</p>
<p>a very large amount.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t do anything about it.</p>
<p>This is on every single platform.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s happening more and more and more,</p>
<p>which I&rsquo;ve been recently informed that they&rsquo;re not emailing.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s cross platform.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re taking people&rsquo;s, they&rsquo;re somehow,</p>
<p>this is fascinating to me because they are taking people</p>
<p>who comment on various social platforms</p>
<p>and they somehow reverse engineer.</p>
<p>They figure out what their email is</p>
<p>and they send an email to that person saying,</p>
<p>from Lex Friedman, and it&rsquo;s like a heartfelt email</p>
<p>with links.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fascinating because it&rsquo;s cross platform now.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just a spam bot that&rsquo;s messaging</p>
<p>and a comment that&rsquo;s in a reply.</p>
<p>They are saying, okay, this person cares</p>
<p>about this other person on social media.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m going to find another channel,</p>
<p>which in their mind probably increases</p>
<p>and it does the likelihood that they&rsquo;ll get the people</p>
<p>to click and they do.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what to do about that.</p>
<p>It makes me really, really sad,</p>
<p>especially with podcasting.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an intimacy that people feel connected</p>
<p>and they get really excited.</p>
<p>Okay, cool, I wanna talk to Lex.</p>
<p>And they click.</p>
<p>And I get angry at the people that do this.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s like the John that gets hired,</p>
<p>the fake employee.</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t know what to do about that.</p>
<p>I mean, I suppose the solution is education.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s telling people to be skeptical</p>
<p>on the stuff they click.</p>
<p>That balance with the technology solution</p>
<p>of creating maybe like two factor authentication</p>
<p>and maybe helping identify things</p>
<p>that are likely to be spam, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>But then the machine learning there is tricky</p>
<p>because you don&rsquo;t wanna add a lot of extra friction</p>
<p>that just annoys people because they&rsquo;ll turn it off.</p>
<p>Because you have the accept cookies thing, right?</p>
<p>That everybody has to click on now,</p>
<p>so now they completely ignore the accept cookies.</p>
<p>This is very difficult to find that frictionless security.</p>
<p>You mentioned Snowden.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve talked about looking through the NSA documents</p>
<p>he leaked and doing the hard work of that.</p>
<p>What do you make of Edward Snowden?</p>
<p>What have you learned from those documents?</p>
<p>What do you think of him?</p>
<p>In the long arc of history,</p>
<p>is Edward Snowden a hero or a villain?</p>
<p>I think he&rsquo;s neither.</p>
<p>I have really complicated feelings about Edward Snowden.</p>
<p>On the one hand, I&rsquo;m a journalist at heart</p>
<p>and more transparency is good.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m grateful for the conversations</p>
<p>that we had in the post Snowden era</p>
<p>about the limits to surveillance</p>
<p>and how critical privacy is.</p>
<p>And when you have no transparency</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t really know in that case</p>
<p>what our secret courts were doing,</p>
<p>how can you truly believe that our country</p>
<p>is taking our civil liberties seriously?</p>
<p>So on the one hand, I&rsquo;m grateful</p>
<p>that he cracked open these debates.</p>
<p>On the other hand, when I walked into the storage closet</p>
<p>of classified NSA secrets,</p>
<p>I had just spent two years</p>
<p>covering Chinese cyber espionage almost every day.</p>
<p>And the sort of advancement of Russian attacks</p>
<p>that were just getting worse and worse and more destructive.</p>
<p>And there were no limits to Chinese cyber espionage</p>
<p>and Chinese surveillance of its own citizens.</p>
<p>And there seemed to be no limit</p>
<p>to what Russia was willing to do in terms of cyber attacks</p>
<p>and also in some cases assassinating journalists.</p>
<p>So when I walked into that room,</p>
<p>there was a part of me quite honestly</p>
<p>that was relieved to know that the NSA</p>
<p>was as good as I hoped they were.</p>
<p>And we weren&rsquo;t using that knowledge to,</p>
<p>as far as I know, assassinate journalists.</p>
<p>We weren&rsquo;t using our access</p>
<p>to take out pharmaceutical companies.</p>
<p>For the most part, we were using it for traditional espionage.</p>
<p>Now, that set of documents also set me</p>
<p>on the journey of my book because to me,</p>
<p>the American people&rsquo;s reaction to the Snowden documents</p>
<p>was a little bit misplaced.</p>
<p>They were upset</p>
<p>about the phone call metadata collection program.</p>
<p>Angela Merkel, I think rightfully was upset</p>
<p>that we were hacking her cell phone.</p>
<p>But in sort of the spy eat spy world,</p>
<p>hacking world leaders cell phones</p>
<p>is pretty much what most spy agencies do.</p>
<p>And there wasn&rsquo;t a lot that I saw in those documents</p>
<p>that was beyond what I thought a spy agency does.</p>
<p>And I think if there was another 9 11 tomorrow,</p>
<p>God forbid, we would all say, how did the NSA miss this?</p>
<p>Why weren&rsquo;t they spying on those terrorists?</p>
<p>Why weren&rsquo;t they spying on those world leaders?</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s some of that too.</p>
<p>But I think that there was great damage done</p>
<p>to the US&rsquo;s reputation.</p>
<p>I think we really lost our halo</p>
<p>in terms of a protector of civil liberties.</p>
<p>And I think a lot of what was reported</p>
<p>was unfortunately reported in a vacuum.</p>
<p>That was my biggest gripe that we were always reporting,</p>
<p>the NSA has this program and here&rsquo;s what it does.</p>
<p>And the NSA is in Angela Merkel&rsquo;s cell phone</p>
<p>and the NSA can do this.</p>
<p>And no one was saying, and by the way,</p>
<p>China has been hacking into our pipelines</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ve been making off</p>
<p>with all of our intellectual property.</p>
<p>And Russia has been hacking into our energy infrastructure</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ve been using the same methods to spy on track.</p>
<p>And in many cases, kill their own journalists.</p>
<p>And the Saudis have been doing this</p>
<p>to their own critics and dissidents.</p>
<p>And so you can&rsquo;t talk about any of these countries</p>
<p>in isolation.</p>
<p>It is really like spy out there.</p>
<p>And so I just have complicated feelings.</p>
<p>And the other thing is, and I&rsquo;m sorry,</p>
<p>this is a little bit of a tangent,</p>
<p>but the amount of documents that we had,</p>
<p>like thousands of documents,</p>
<p>most of which were just crap,</p>
<p>but had people&rsquo;s names on them.</p>
<p>Part of me wishes that those documents</p>
<p>had been released in a much more targeted, limited way.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a lot of it just felt like a PowerPoint</p>
<p>that was taken out of context.</p>
<p>And you just sort of wish</p>
<p>that there had been a little bit more thought</p>
<p>into what was released.</p>
<p>Because I think a lot of the impact from someone</p>
<p>was just the volume of the reporting.</p>
<p>But I think based on what I saw personally,</p>
<p>there was a lot of stuff that I just,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why that particular thing got released.</p>
<p>As a whistleblower, what&rsquo;s a better way to do it?</p>
<p>Because I mean, there&rsquo;s fear,</p>
<p>it takes a lot of effort to do a more targeted release.</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s proper channels,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re afraid that those channels will be manipulated</p>
<p>by who do you trust.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s a better way to do this, do you think?</p>
<p>As a journalist, this is almost like a journalistic question.</p>
<p>Reveal some fundamental flaw in the system</p>
<p>without destroying the system.</p>
<p>I bring up, again, Mark Zuckerberg and Metta,</p>
<p>there was a whistleblower</p>
<p>that came out about Instagram internal studies.</p>
<p>And I also torn about how to feel about that whistleblower.</p>
<p>Because from a company perspective, that&rsquo;s an open culture.</p>
<p>How can you operate successfully</p>
<p>if you have an open culture</p>
<p>where any one whistleblower can come out,</p>
<p>out of context, take a study,</p>
<p>whether it represents a larger context or not,</p>
<p>and the press eats it up.</p>
<p>And then that creates a narrative</p>
<p>that is just like with the NSA,</p>
<p>you said it&rsquo;s out of context, very targeted,</p>
<p>to where, well, Facebook is evil, clearly,</p>
<p>because of this one leak.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really hard to know what to do there,</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re now in a society</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s deeply distrust institutions.</p>
<p>And so narratives by whistleblowers make that whistleblower</p>
<p>and their forthcoming book very popular.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s a huge incentive</p>
<p>to take stuff out of context and to tell stories</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t represent the full context, the full truth.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to know what to do with that,</p>
<p>because then that forces Facebook and Meta and governments</p>
<p>to be much more conservative, much more secretive.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a race to the bottom, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you can comment on any of that,</p>
<p>how to be a whistleblower ethically and properly.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, I mean, these are hard questions.</p>
<p>And even for myself, in some ways,</p>
<p>I think of my book as sort of blowing the whistle</p>
<p>on the underground zero day market.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not like I was in the market myself.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like I had access to classified data</p>
<p>when I was reporting out that book.</p>
<p>As I say in the book, listen,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just trying to scrape the surface here,</p>
<p>so we can have these conversations before it&rsquo;s too late.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s plenty in there</p>
<p>that someone who&rsquo;s US intelligence agencies</p>
<p>preeminent zero day broker probably</p>
<p>has some voodoo doll of me out there.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re never gonna get it 100%.</p>
<p>But I really applaud whistleblowers</p>
<p>like the whistleblower who blew the whistle</p>
<p>on the Trump call with Zelensky.</p>
<p>I mean, people needed to know about that,</p>
<p>that we were basically, in some ways,</p>
<p>blackmailing an ally to try to influence an election.</p>
<p>I mean, they went through the proper channels.</p>
<p>They weren&rsquo;t trying to profit off of it, right?</p>
<p>There was no book that came out afterwards</p>
<p>from that whistleblower.</p>
<p>That whistleblower&rsquo;s not like,</p>
<p>they went through the channels.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not living in Moscow, let&rsquo;s put it that way.</p>
<p>Can I ask you a question, you mentioned NSA,</p>
<p>one of the things that showed</p>
<p>is they&rsquo;re pretty good at what they do.</p>
<p>Again, this is a touchy subject, I suppose,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a lot of conspiracy theories</p>
<p>about intelligence agencies.</p>
<p>From your understanding of intelligence agencies,</p>
<p>the CIA, NSA, and the equivalent of in other countries,</p>
<p>are they, one question, this could be a dangerous question,</p>
<p>are they competent, are they good at what they do?</p>
<p>And two, are they malevolent in any way?</p>
<p>Sort of, I recently had a conversation</p>
<p>about tobacco companies.</p>
<p>They kind of see their customers as dupes,</p>
<p>like they can just play games with people.</p>
<p>Conspiracy theories tell that similar story</p>
<p>about intelligence agencies,</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re interested in manipulating the populace</p>
<p>for whatever ends the powerful,</p>
<p>in dark rooms, cigarette smoke, cigar smoke filled rooms.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your sense?</p>
<p>Do these conspiracy theories have any truth to them?</p>
<p>Or are intelligence agencies, for the most part,</p>
<p>good for society?</p>
<p>Okay, well, that&rsquo;s an easy one.</p>
<p>Is it?</p>
<p>No, I think it depends which intelligence agency.</p>
<p>Think about the Mossad.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re killing every Iranian nuclear scientist they can</p>
<p>over the years, but have they delayed the time horizon</p>
<p>before Iran gets the bomb?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Have they probably staved off terror attacks</p>
<p>on their own citizens?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You know, none of these, intelligence is intelligence.</p>
<p>You know, you can&rsquo;t just say like they&rsquo;re malevolent</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;re heroes.</p>
<p>You know, everyone I have met in this space</p>
<p>is not like the pound your chest patriot</p>
<p>that you see on the beach on the 4th of July.</p>
<p>A lot of them have complicated feelings</p>
<p>about their former employers.</p>
<p>Well, at least at the NSA reminded me</p>
<p>to do what we were accused of doing after Snowden,</p>
<p>to spy on Americans.</p>
<p>You have no idea the amount of red tape and paperwork</p>
<p>and bureaucracy it would have taken to do</p>
<p>what everyone thinks that we were supposedly doing.</p>
<p>But then, you know, we find out in the course</p>
<p>of the Snowden reporting about a program called Lovin',</p>
<p>where a couple of the NSA analysts were using their access</p>
<p>to spy on their ex girlfriends.</p>
<p>So, you know, there&rsquo;s an exception to every case.</p>
<p>Generally, I will probably get, you know,</p>
<p>accused of my Western bias here again,</p>
<p>but I think you can almost barely compare</p>
<p>some of these Western intelligence agencies</p>
<p>to China, for instance.</p>
<p>And the surveillance that they&rsquo;re deploying on the Uyghurs</p>
<p>to the level they&rsquo;re deploying it.</p>
<p>And the surveillance they&rsquo;re starting to export abroad</p>
<p>with some of the programs,</p>
<p>like the watering hole attack I mentioned earlier,</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s not just hitting the Uyghurs inside China,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hitting anyone interested</p>
<p>in the Uyghur plight outside China.</p>
<p>I mean, it could be an American high school student</p>
<p>writing a paper on the Uyghurs.</p>
<p>They wanna spy on that person too.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s no rules in China</p>
<p>really limiting the extent of that surveillance.</p>
<p>And we all better pay attention to what&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>with the Uyghurs because just as Ukraine has been to Russia</p>
<p>in terms of a test kitchen for its cyber attacks,</p>
<p>the Uyghurs are China&rsquo;s test kitchen for surveillance.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s no doubt in my mind</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re testing them on the Uyghurs.</p>
<p>Uyghurs are their Petri dish,</p>
<p>and eventually they will export</p>
<p>that level of surveillance overseas.</p>
<p>I mean, in 2015,</p>
<p>Obama and Xi Jinping reached a deal</p>
<p>where basically the White House said,</p>
<p>you better cut it out on intellectual property theft.</p>
<p>And so they made this agreement</p>
<p>that they would not hack each other for commercial benefit.</p>
<p>And for a period of about 18 months,</p>
<p>we saw this huge drop off in Chinese cyber attacks</p>
<p>on American companies.</p>
<p>But some of them continued.</p>
<p>Where did they continue?</p>
<p>They continued on aviation companies,</p>
<p>on hospitality companies like Marriott.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because that was still considered fair game to China.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t IP theft they were after.</p>
<p>They wanted to know who was staying in this city</p>
<p>at this time when Chinese citizens were staying there</p>
<p>so they could cross match for counterintelligence</p>
<p>who might be a likely Chinese spy.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;re doing some of that too.</p>
<p>Counterintelligence is counterintelligence.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s considered fair game.</p>
<p>But where I think it gets evil</p>
<p>is when you use it for censorship,</p>
<p>to suppress any dissent,</p>
<p>to do what I&rsquo;ve seen the UAE do to its citizens</p>
<p>where people who&rsquo;ve gone on Twitter</p>
<p>just to advocate for better voting rights,</p>
<p>more enfranchisement,</p>
<p>suddenly find their passports confiscated.</p>
<p>You know, I talked to one critic, Ahmed Mansour,</p>
<p>and he told me,</p>
<p>you know, you might find yourself a terrorist,</p>
<p>labeled a terrorist one day,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t even know how to operate a gun.</p>
<p>I mean, he had been beaten up</p>
<p>every time he tried to go somewhere.</p>
<p>His passport had been confiscated.</p>
<p>By that point, it turned out</p>
<p>they&rsquo;d already hacked into his phone</p>
<p>so they were listening to us talking.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;d hacked into his baby monitor</p>
<p>so they&rsquo;re spying on his child.</p>
<p>And they stole his car.</p>
<p>And then they created a new law</p>
<p>that you couldn&rsquo;t criticize the ruling family</p>
<p>or the ruling party on Twitter.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s been in solitary confinement every day since</p>
<p>on hunger strike.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s evil, you know, that&rsquo;s evil.</p>
<p>And we still, we don&rsquo;t do that here.</p>
<p>You know, we have rules here.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t cross that line.</p>
<p>So yeah, in some cases, like I won&rsquo;t go to Dubai.</p>
<p>You know, I won&rsquo;t go to Abu Dhabi.</p>
<p>If I ever want to go to the Maldives,</p>
<p>like too bad, like most of the flights go through Dubai.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s some lines we&rsquo;re not willing to cross.</p>
<p>But then again, just like you said,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s individuals within NSA, within CIA,</p>
<p>and they may have power.</p>
<p>And to me, there&rsquo;s levels of evil.</p>
<p>To me personally, this is the stuff of conspiracy theories,</p>
<p>is the things you&rsquo;ve mentioned as evil</p>
<p>are more direct attacks.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s also psychological warfare.</p>
<p>So blackmail.</p>
<p>So what does spying allow you to do?</p>
<p>Allow you to collect information</p>
<p>if you have something that&rsquo;s embarrassing.</p>
<p>Or if you have like Jeffrey Epstein conspiracy theories,</p>
<p>active, what is it, manufacture of embarrassing things.</p>
<p>And then use blackmail to manipulate the population</p>
<p>or all the powerful people involved.</p>
<p>It troubles me deeply that MIT allowed somebody</p>
<p>like Jeffrey Epstein in their midst,</p>
<p>especially some of the scientists I admire</p>
<p>that they would hang out with that person at all.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;ll talk about it sometimes.</p>
<p>And then a lot of people tell me,</p>
<p>well, obviously Jeffrey Epstein is a front for intelligence.</p>
<p>And I just, I struggle to see that level of competence</p>
<p>and malevolence.</p>
<p>But, you know, who the hell am I?</p>
<p>And I guess I was trying to get to that point.</p>
<p>You said that there&rsquo;s bureaucracy and so on,</p>
<p>which makes some of these things very difficult.</p>
<p>I wonder how much malevolence,</p>
<p>how much competence there is in these institutions.</p>
<p>Like how far, this takes us back to the hacking question.</p>
<p>How far are people willing to go if they have the power?</p>
<p>This has to do with social engineering.</p>
<p>This has to do with hacking.</p>
<p>This has to do with manipulating people,</p>
<p>attacking people, doing evil onto people,</p>
<p>psychological warfare and stuff like that.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I believe that most people are good.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s possible in a free society.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something that happens</p>
<p>when you have a centralized government</p>
<p>where power corrupts over time</p>
<p>and you start surveillance programs</p>
<p>kind of, it&rsquo;s like a slippery slope</p>
<p>that over time starts to both use fear</p>
<p>and direct manipulation to control the populace.</p>
<p>But in a free society, I just,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s difficult for me to imagine</p>
<p>that you can have like somebody like a Jeffrey Epstein</p>
<p>in the front for intelligence.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m asking you, but I&rsquo;m just,</p>
<p>I have a hope that for the most part,</p>
<p>intelligence agencies are trying to do good</p>
<p>and are actually doing good for the world</p>
<p>when you view it in the full context</p>
<p>of the complexities of the world.</p>
<p>But then again, if they&rsquo;re not, would we know?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why Edward Snowden might be a good thing.</p>
<p>Let me ask you on a personal question.</p>
<p>You have investigated some of the most powerful</p>
<p>organizations and people in the world</p>
<p>of cyber warfare, cyber security.</p>
<p>Are you ever afraid for your own life,</p>
<p>your own wellbeing, digital or physical?</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;ve had my moments.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;ve had our security team at the times</p>
<p>called me at one point and said,</p>
<p>someone&rsquo;s on the dark web offering good money</p>
<p>to anyone who can hack your phone or your laptop.</p>
<p>I describe in my book how when I was at that</p>
<p>hacking conference in Argentina and I came back</p>
<p>and I brought a burner laptop with me,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;d kept it in the safe anyway</p>
<p>and it didn&rsquo;t have anything on it,</p>
<p>but someone had broken in and it was moved.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;ve had all sorts of sort of scary moments.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;ve had moments where I think I went</p>
<p>just way too far into the paranoid side.</p>
<p>I mean, I remember writing about the Times hack by China</p>
<p>and I just covered a number of Chinese cyber attacks</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;d gotten into the thermostat</p>
<p>at someone&rsquo;s corporate apartment</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;d gotten into all sorts of stuff.</p>
<p>And I was living by myself.</p>
<p>I was single in San Francisco and my cable box</p>
<p>on my television started making some weird noises</p>
<p>in the middle of the night.</p>
<p>And I got up and I ripped it out of the wall</p>
<p>and I think I said something like embarrassing,</p>
<p>like, fuck you China, you know.</p>
<p>And then I went back to bed and I woke up</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like beautiful morning light.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;ll never forget it.</p>
<p>Like this is like glimmering morning light</p>
<p>is shining on my cable box, which has now been ripped out</p>
<p>and is sitting on my floor and like the morning light.</p>
<p>And I was just like, no, no, no,</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;m not going down that road.</p>
<p>Like you basically, I came to a fork in the road</p>
<p>where I could either go full tinfoil hat,</p>
<p>go live off the grid, never have a car with navigation,</p>
<p>never use Google maps, never own an iPhone,</p>
<p>never order diapers off Amazon, you know, create an alias</p>
<p>or I could just do the best I can</p>
<p>and live in this new digital world we&rsquo;re living in.</p>
<p>And what does that look like for me?</p>
<p>I mean, what are my crown jewels?</p>
<p>This is what I tell people, what are your crown jewels?</p>
<p>Cause just focus on that.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t protect everything,</p>
<p>but you can protect your crown jewels.</p>
<p>For me, for the longest time,</p>
<p>my crown jewels were my sources.</p>
<p>I was nothing without my sources.</p>
<p>So I had some sources, I would meet the same dim sum place</p>
<p>or maybe it was a different restaurant on the same date,</p>
<p>you know, every quarter and we would never drive there.</p>
<p>We would never Uber there.</p>
<p>We wouldn&rsquo;t bring any devices.</p>
<p>I could bring a pencil and a notepad.</p>
<p>And if someone wasn&rsquo;t in town,</p>
<p>like there were a couple of times where I&rsquo;d show up</p>
<p>and the source never came,</p>
<p>but we never communicated digitally.</p>
<p>And those were the links I was willing to go</p>
<p>to protect that source, but you can&rsquo;t do it for everyone.</p>
<p>So for everyone else, you know, it was signal,</p>
<p>using two factor authentication,</p>
<p>you know, keeping my devices up to date,</p>
<p>not clicking on phishing emails, using a password manager,</p>
<p>all the things that we know we&rsquo;re supposed to do.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what I tell everyone, like don&rsquo;t go crazy</p>
<p>because then that&rsquo;s like the ultimate hack.</p>
<p>Then they&rsquo;ve hacked your mind, whoever they is for you.</p>
<p>But just do the best you can.</p>
<p>Now, my whole risk model changed when I had a kid.</p>
<p>You know, now it&rsquo;s, oh God, you know,</p>
<p>if anyone threatened my family, God help them.</p>
<p>But it changes you.</p>
<p>And, you know, unfortunately there are some things,</p>
<p>like I was really scared to go deep on,</p>
<p>like Russian cyber crime, you know, like Putin himself,</p>
<p>you know, and it&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>Like I have a mentor who&rsquo;s an incredible person</p>
<p>who was the Times Moscow Bureau Chief during the Cold War.</p>
<p>And after I wrote a series of stories</p>
<p>about Chinese cyber espionage, he took me out to lunch.</p>
<p>And he told me that when he was living in Moscow,</p>
<p>he would drop his kids off at preschool</p>
<p>when they were my son&rsquo;s age now.</p>
<p>And the KGB would follow him</p>
<p>and they would make a really like loud show of it.</p>
<p>You know, they&rsquo;d tail him, they&rsquo;d, you know, honk,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;d just be, make a ruckus.</p>
<p>And he said, you know what, they never actually did anything</p>
<p>but they wanted me to know that they were following me</p>
<p>and I operated accordingly.</p>
<p>And he says, that&rsquo;s how you should operate</p>
<p>in the digital world.</p>
<p>Know that there are probably people following you.</p>
<p>Sometimes they&rsquo;ll make a little bit of noise.</p>
<p>But one thing you need to know is that</p>
<p>while you&rsquo;re at the New York Times,</p>
<p>you have a little bit of an invisible shield on you.</p>
<p>You know, if something were to happen to you,</p>
<p>that would be a really big deal.</p>
<p>That would be an international incident.</p>
<p>So I kind of carried that invisible shield with me</p>
<p>for years.</p>
<p>And then Jamal Khashoggi happened.</p>
<p>And that destroyed my vision of my invisible shield.</p>
<p>You know, sure, you know, he was a Saudi</p>
<p>but he was a Washington Post columnist.</p>
<p>You know, for the most part,</p>
<p>he was living in the United States.</p>
<p>He was a journalist.</p>
<p>And for them to do what they did to him,</p>
<p>pretty much in the open and get away with it,</p>
<p>and for the United States to let them get away with it</p>
<p>because we wanted to preserve diplomatic relations</p>
<p>with the Saudis,</p>
<p>that really threw my worldview upside down.</p>
<p>And, you know, I think that sent a message</p>
<p>to a lot of countries</p>
<p>that it was sort of open season on journalists.</p>
<p>And to me, that was one of the most destructive things</p>
<p>that happened under the previous administration.</p>
<p>And, you know, I don&rsquo;t really know</p>
<p>what to think of my invisible shield anymore.</p>
<p>Like you said, that really worries me</p>
<p>on the journalism side that people would be afraid</p>
<p>to dig deep on fascinating topics.</p>
<p>And, you know, I have my own,</p>
<p>part of the reason, like I would love to have kids,</p>
<p>I would love to have a family.</p>
<p>Part of the reason I&rsquo;m a little bit afraid,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s many ways to phrase this,</p>
<p>but the loss of freedom in the way of doing</p>
<p>all the crazy shit that I naturally do,</p>
<p>which I would say the ethic of journalism</p>
<p>is kind of not, is doing crazy shit</p>
<p>without really thinking about it.</p>
<p>This is letting your curiosity</p>
<p>really allow you to be free and explore.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, I mean, whether it&rsquo;s stupidity or fearlessness,</p>
<p>whatever it is, that&rsquo;s what great journalism is.</p>
<p>And all the concerns about security risks</p>
<p>have made me like become a better person.</p>
<p>The way I approach it is just make sure</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have anything to hide.</p>
<p>I know this is not a thing.</p>
<p>This is not a, this is not an approach to security.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just, this is like a motivational speech or something.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like, if you can lose,</p>
<p>you can be hacked at any moment.</p>
<p>Just don&rsquo;t be a douchebag secretly.</p>
<p>Just be like a good person.</p>
<p>Because then, I see this actually</p>
<p>with social media in general.</p>
<p>Just present yourself in the most authentic way possible,</p>
<p>meaning be the same person online as you are privately.</p>
<p>Have nothing to hide.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one, not the only, but one of the ways</p>
<p>to achieve security.</p>
<p>Maybe I&rsquo;m totally wrong on this,</p>
<p>but don&rsquo;t be secretly weird.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re weird, be publicly weird</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s impossible to blackmail you.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my approach to security.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, they call it</p>
<p>the New York Times front page phenomenon.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t put anything in email or I guess social media</p>
<p>these days that you wouldn&rsquo;t want to read</p>
<p>on the front page of the New York Times.</p>
<p>And that works, but sometimes I even get carried,</p>
<p>I mean, I have not as many followers as you,</p>
<p>but a lot of followers,</p>
<p>and sometimes even I get carried away.</p>
<p>Just be emotional and stuff and say something.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, just the cortisol response on Twitter.</p>
<p>Twitter is basically designed to elicit those responses.</p>
<p>I mean, every day I turn on my computer,</p>
<p>I look at my phone, I look at what&rsquo;s trending on Twitter,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like, what are the topics</p>
<p>that are gonna make people the most angry today?</p>
<p>You know?</p>
<p>And you know, it&rsquo;s easy to get carried away,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also just, that sucks too,</p>
<p>that you have to be constantly censoring yourself.</p>
<p>And maybe it&rsquo;s for the better.</p>
<p>Maybe you can&rsquo;t be a secret asshole,</p>
<p>and we can put that in the good bucket.</p>
<p>But at the same time, you know,</p>
<p>there is a danger to that other voice,</p>
<p>to creativity, you know, to being weird.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a danger to that little whispered voice</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like, well, how would people read that?</p>
<p>You know, how could that be manipulated?</p>
<p>How could that be used against you?</p>
<p>And that stifles creativity and innovation and free thought.</p>
<p>And you know, that is on a very micro level.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s something I think about a lot.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s actually something that Tim Cook</p>
<p>has talked about a lot,</p>
<p>and why he has said he goes full force on privacy</p>
<p>is it&rsquo;s just that little voice</p>
<p>that is at some level censoring you.</p>
<p>And what is sort of the long term impact</p>
<p>of that little voice over time?</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a ways, I think that self censorship</p>
<p>is an attack factor that there&rsquo;s solutions to.</p>
<p>The way I&rsquo;m really inspired by Elon Musk,</p>
<p>the solution to that is just be privately</p>
<p>and publicly the same person and be ridiculous.</p>
<p>Embrace the full weirdness and show it more and more.</p>
<p>So, you know, that&rsquo;s memes that has like ridiculous humor.</p>
<p>And I think, and if there is something</p>
<p>you really wanna hide, deeply consider</p>
<p>if that you wanna be that.</p>
<p>Like, why are you hiding it?</p>
<p>What exactly are you afraid of?</p>
<p>Because I think my hopeful vision for the internet</p>
<p>is the internet loves authenticity.</p>
<p>They wanna see you weird, so be that and like live that fully</p>
<p>because I think that gray area</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re kind of censoring yourself,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s where the destruction is.</p>
<p>You have to go all the way, step over, be weird.</p>
<p>And then it feels, it can be painful</p>
<p>because people can attack you and so on, but just ride it.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s just like a skill</p>
<p>on the social psychological level</p>
<p>that ends up being an approach to security,</p>
<p>which is like remove the attack vector</p>
<p>of having private information</p>
<p>by being your full weird self publicly.</p>
<p>What advice would you give to young folks today,</p>
<p>you know, operating in this complicated space</p>
<p>about how to have a successful life,</p>
<p>a life they can be proud of,</p>
<p>a career they can be proud of?</p>
<p>Maybe somebody in high school and college</p>
<p>thinking about what they&rsquo;re going to do.</p>
<p>Be a hacker, you know, if you have any interest,</p>
<p>become a hacker and apply yourself to defense, you know.</p>
<p>Every time, like we do have</p>
<p>these amazing scholarship programs, for instance,</p>
<p>where, you know, they find you early,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll pay your college as long as you commit</p>
<p>to some kind of federal commitment</p>
<p>to sort of help federal agencies with cybersecurity.</p>
<p>And where does everyone wanna go every year</p>
<p>from the scholarship program?</p>
<p>They wanna go work at the NSA or Cyber Command, you know.</p>
<p>They wanna go work on offense.</p>
<p>They wanna go do the sexy stuff.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really hard to get people to work on defense.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s always been more fun</p>
<p>to be a pirate than be in the Coast Guard, you know.</p>
<p>And so we have a huge deficit</p>
<p>when it comes to filling those roles.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s 3.5 million unfilled cybersecurity positions</p>
<p>around the world.</p>
<p>I mean, talk about job security,</p>
<p>like be a hacker and work on cybersecurity.</p>
<p>You will always have a job.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re actually at a huge deficit</p>
<p>and disadvantage as a free market economy</p>
<p>because we can&rsquo;t match cybersecurity salaries</p>
<p>at Palantir or Facebook or Google or Microsoft.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s really hard for the United States</p>
<p>to fill those roles.</p>
<p>And, you know, other countries have had this work around</p>
<p>where they basically have forced conscription on some level.</p>
<p>You know, China tells people,</p>
<p>like you do whatever you&rsquo;re gonna do during the day,</p>
<p>work at Alibaba.</p>
<p>You know, if you need to do some ransomware, okay.</p>
<p>But the minute we tap you on the shoulder</p>
<p>and ask you to come do this sensitive operation for us,</p>
<p>the answer is yes.</p>
<p>You know, same with Russia.</p>
<p>You know, a couple of years ago when Yahoo was hacked</p>
<p>and they laid it all out in an indictment,</p>
<p>it came down to two cyber criminals</p>
<p>and two guys from the FSB.</p>
<p>Cyber criminals were allowed to have their fun,</p>
<p>but the minute they came across the username and password</p>
<p>for someone&rsquo;s personal Yahoo account</p>
<p>that worked at the White House or the State Department</p>
<p>or military, they were expected to pass that over to the FSB.</p>
<p>So we don&rsquo;t do that here.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s even worse on defense.</p>
<p>We really can&rsquo;t fill these positions.</p>
<p>So, you know, if you are a hacker,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re interested in code,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re a tinker, you know, learn how to hack.</p>
<p>There are all sorts of amazing hacking competitions</p>
<p>you can do through the SANS org, for example, S A N S.</p>
<p>And then use those skills for good.</p>
<p>You know, neuter the bugs in that code</p>
<p>that get used by autocratic regimes</p>
<p>to make people&rsquo;s life, you know, a living prison.</p>
<p>You know, plug those holes.</p>
<p>You know, defend industrial systems,</p>
<p>defend our water treatment facilities</p>
<p>from hacks where people are trying to come in</p>
<p>and poison the water.</p>
<p>You know, that I think is just an amazing,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an amazing job on so many levels.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s intellectually stimulating.</p>
<p>You can tell yourself you&rsquo;re serving your country.</p>
<p>You can tell yourself you&rsquo;re saving lives</p>
<p>and keeping people safe.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ll always have amazing job security.</p>
<p>And if you need to go get that job that pays you,</p>
<p>you know, 2 million bucks a year, you can do that too.</p>
<p>And you can have a public profile,</p>
<p>more so of a public profile, you can be a public rockstar.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s the same thing as sort of the military.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of well known sort of people</p>
<p>commenting on the fact that veterans</p>
<p>are not treated as well as they should be.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s still the fact that soldiers</p>
<p>are deeply respected for defending the country,</p>
<p>the freedoms, the ideals that we stand for.</p>
<p>And in the same way, I mean, in some ways,</p>
<p>the cybersecurity defense are the soldiers of the future.</p>
<p>Yeah, and you know what&rsquo;s interesting,</p>
<p>I mean, in cybersecurity, the difference is,</p>
<p>oftentimes you see the more interesting threats</p>
<p>in the private sector, because that&rsquo;s where the attacks come.</p>
<p>You know, when cyber criminals</p>
<p>and nation state adversaries come for the United States,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t go directly for Cyber Command or the NSA.</p>
<p>You know, they go for banks, they go for Google,</p>
<p>they go for Microsoft, they go for critical infrastructure.</p>
<p>And so those companies, those private sector companies</p>
<p>get to see some of the most advanced,</p>
<p>sophisticated attacks out there.</p>
<p>And you know, if you&rsquo;re working at FireEye</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re calling out the SolarWinds attack, for instance,</p>
<p>I mean, you just saved God knows how many systems</p>
<p>from, you know, that compromise turning into something</p>
<p>that more closely resembles sabotage.</p>
<p>So, you know, go be a hacker, or go be a journalist.</p>
<p>So you wrote the book,</p>
<p>This Is How They Tell Me The World Ends,</p>
<p>as we&rsquo;ve been talking about,</p>
<p>of course, referring to cyber war, cybersecurity.</p>
<p>What gives you hope about the future of our world</p>
<p>if it doesn&rsquo;t end?</p>
<p>How will it not end?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good question.</p>
<p>I mean, I have to have hope, right?</p>
<p>Because I have a kid and I have another on the way,</p>
<p>and if I didn&rsquo;t have hope, I wouldn&rsquo;t be having kids.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s a scary time to be having kids.</p>
<p>And you know, it&rsquo;s like pandemic, climate change,</p>
<p>disinformation, increasingly advanced, perhaps deadly</p>
<p>cyber attacks.</p>
<p>What gives me hope is that I share your worldview</p>
<p>that I think people are fundamentally good.</p>
<p>And sometimes, and this is why the metaverse</p>
<p>scares me to death, but when I&rsquo;m reminded of that</p>
<p>is not online.</p>
<p>Like online, I get the opposite.</p>
<p>You know, you start to lose hope and humanity</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re on Twitter half your day.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like when I go to the grocery store</p>
<p>or I go on a hike or like someone smiles at me</p>
<p>or you know, or someone just says something nice.</p>
<p>You know, people are fundamentally good.</p>
<p>We just don&rsquo;t hear from those people enough.</p>
<p>And my hope is, I just think our current political climate,</p>
<p>like we&rsquo;ve hit rock bottom.</p>
<p>This is as bad as it gets.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t do anything.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t jinx it.</p>
<p>But I think it&rsquo;s a generational thing.</p>
<p>You know, I think baby boomers, like it&rsquo;s time to move along.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s time for a new generation to come in.</p>
<p>And I actually have a lot of hope when I look at you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sort of like this, I guess they call me</p>
<p>a geriatric millennial or a young gen X.</p>
<p>But like we have this unique responsibility</p>
<p>because I grew up without the internet</p>
<p>and without social media, but I&rsquo;m native to it.</p>
<p>So I know the good and I know the bad.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s true on so many different things.</p>
<p>You know, I grew up without climate change anxiety</p>
<p>and now I&rsquo;m feeling it and I know it&rsquo;s not a given.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have to just resign ourselves to climate change.</p>
<p>You know, same with disinformation.</p>
<p>And I think a lot of the problems we face today</p>
<p>have just exposed the sort of inertia</p>
<p>that there has been on so many of these issues.</p>
<p>And I really think it&rsquo;s a generational shift</p>
<p>that has to happen.</p>
<p>And I think this next generation is gonna come in</p>
<p>and say like, we&rsquo;re not doing business</p>
<p>like you guys did it anymore.</p>
<p>You know, we&rsquo;re not just gonna like rape</p>
<p>and pillage the earth and try and turn everyone</p>
<p>against each other and play dirty tricks</p>
<p>and let lobbyists dictate what we do</p>
<p>or don&rsquo;t do as a country anymore.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s really where I see the hope.</p>
<p>It feels like there&rsquo;s a lot of low hanging fruit</p>
<p>for young minds to step up and create solutions and lead.</p>
<p>So whenever like politicians or leaders that are older,</p>
<p>like you said, are acting shitty, I see that as a positive.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re inspiring a large number of young people</p>
<p>to replace them.</p>
<p>And so I think you&rsquo;re right, there&rsquo;s going to be,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost like you need people to act shitty</p>
<p>to remind them, oh, wow, we need good leaders.</p>
<p>We need great creators and builders and entrepreneurs</p>
<p>and scientists and engineers and journalists.</p>
<p>You know, all the discussions about how the journalism</p>
<p>is quote unquote broken and so on,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just an inspiration for new institutions to rise up</p>
<p>that do journalism better,</p>
<p>new journalists to step up and do journalism better.</p>
<p>So I, and I&rsquo;ve been constantly,</p>
<p>when I talk to young people, I&rsquo;m constantly impressed</p>
<p>by the ones that dream to build solutions.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s ultimately why I put the hope.</p>
<p>But the world is a messy place,</p>
<p>like we&rsquo;ve been talking about, it&rsquo;s a scary place.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I think you hit something,</p>
<p>hit on something earlier, which is authenticity.</p>
<p>Like no one is going to rise above that is plastic anymore.</p>
<p>You know, people are craving authenticity.</p>
<p>You know, the benefit of the internet is it&rsquo;s really hard</p>
<p>to hide who you are on every single platform.</p>
<p>You know, on some level it&rsquo;s gonna come out</p>
<p>who you really are.</p>
<p>And so you hope that, you know,</p>
<p>by the time my kids are grown,</p>
<p>like no one&rsquo;s gonna care if they made one mistake online,</p>
<p>so long as they&rsquo;re authentic, you know?</p>
<p>And I used to worry about this.</p>
<p>My nephew was born the day I graduated from college.</p>
<p>And I just always, you know, he&rsquo;s like born into Facebook.</p>
<p>And I just think like, how is a kid like that</p>
<p>ever gonna be president of the United States of America?</p>
<p>Because if Facebook had been around when I was in college,</p>
<p>you know, like Jesus, you know,</p>
<p>how are those kids are gonna ever be president?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s gonna be some photo of them at some point</p>
<p>making some mistake, and that&rsquo;s gonna be all over for them.</p>
<p>And now I take that back.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s like, no, everyone&rsquo;s gonna make mistakes.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s gonna be a picture for everyone.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re all gonna have to come and grow up</p>
<p>to the view that as humans, we&rsquo;re gonna make huge mistakes.</p>
<p>And hopefully they&rsquo;re not so big</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re gonna ruin the rest of your life.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;re gonna have to come around to this view</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re all human.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re gonna have to be a little bit more forgiving</p>
<p>and a little bit more tolerant when people mess up.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re gonna have to be a little bit more humble</p>
<p>when we do, and like keep moving forward.</p>
<p>Otherwise you can&rsquo;t like cancel everyone, you know?</p>
<p>Nicole, this is an incredible, hopeful conversation.</p>
<p>Also, one that reveals that in the shadows</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of challenges to be solved.</p>
<p>So I really appreciate that you took on</p>
<p>this really difficult subject with your book.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s journalism at its best.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m really grateful that you took the risk</p>
<p>that you took that on,</p>
<p>and that you plugged the cable box back in.</p>
<p>That means you have hope.</p>
<p>And thank you so much for spending</p>
<p>your valuable time with me today.</p>
<p>Thank you, thanks for having me.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation</p>
<p>with Nicole Perlroth.</p>
<p>To support this podcast,</p>
<p>please check out our sponsors in the description.</p>
<p>And now let me leave you with some words</p>
<p>from Nicole herself.</p>
<p>Here we are, entrusting our entire digital lives,</p>
<p>passwords, texts, love letters, banking records,</p>
<p>health records, credit cards, sources,</p>
<p>and deepest thoughts to this mystery box</p>
<p>whose inner circuitry most of us would never vet.</p>
<p>Run by code written in a language most of us</p>
<p>will never fully understand.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.</p>
