    <p>Is the natural sunlight making me look fucked up or is it giving cute like is it giving like yeah</p>
<p>It looks good, or we look stupid. I can&rsquo;t tell hi friends</p>
<p>So this week we&rsquo;re talking about how to do what&rsquo;s right even when it hurts</p>
<p>And I got a personal example to share with you and the reason we&rsquo;re talking about it is because I&rsquo;m going through it</p>
<p>I met a guy</p>
<p>Recently and we all know that I do not meet people I do not date</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like that shit, but I ended up meeting someone that I really connected with and everything was going great</p>
<p>It was peaches and cream and then I ended up having to cut it off</p>
<p>And it was a very hard decision to make so I&rsquo;m gonna share everything in this episode about</p>
<p>Doing what&rsquo;s right?</p>
<p>Finding out which decision is the right one to make how to make it and then how to comfort yourself</p>
<p>After cuz dealing with the consequences even when you do the right thing when it fucking hurts</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s some people don&rsquo;t tell you about so I&rsquo;ve got you. I&rsquo;ll tell you how I dealt with myself and cried</p>
<p>So before we jump into this my birthday is next week. I&rsquo;m gonna be 25. I&rsquo;m giving old fucking geezer</p>
<p>I know I look 40 shut up. It&rsquo;s the trauma. It aged me, but for my birthday. I&rsquo;m dropping a very limited merch design</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna be a t-shirt and a hoodie that say in Leo we trust</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s only gonna be available for my birthday the 24 hours of March 7th mark your fucking calendar, bitch</p>
<p>Cuz I don&rsquo;t know if they&rsquo;re gonna sell out</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll see if they sell out if they do sorry</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s only gonna be available for 24 hours even if they don&rsquo;t sell out so you only got 24 hours to get it</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s gonna be midnight to midnight of March 7th</p>
<p>The link will be in the description to get one if you want one</p>
<p>But I like the idea of doing something very limited for my birthday</p>
<p>Like if you&rsquo;re around at this time like you get it like you fuck with me like that</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like we have like a little piece of like our like journey together. You know cuz my shits like blowing up right now</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like I want to have a way to like know who was like</p>
<p>Around and I&rsquo;ve talked about doing that design before and you guys love it, but I wanted to make it special</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s only gonna be for my birthday. I will be posting about it on Instagram and tik-tok and all that</p>
<p>So if you forget I&rsquo;ll remind you but set it in your fucking calendar bitch cuz last time I did a drop I had</p>
<p>200 orders in the first 20 minutes and girl if my birthday is anything like that</p>
<p>We selling out</p>
<p>So before we jump into me talking about the guy</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna tell you a couple of really hard decisions that I&rsquo;ve had to make in my life</p>
<p>Because I&rsquo;ve had to do it a lot since I&rsquo;m very young</p>
<p>this is a skill I learned very early on handling adult situations and</p>
<p>making very hard decisions from a very young age and the first one started when I was 12 and</p>
<p>I chose to move out of my mom&rsquo;s house and move in with my dad</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so much take into consideration and to be at such a young age to have to do that shit</p>
<p>Girl, that was just the beginning of it</p>
<p>Because when I was 16, I moved out of my dad&rsquo;s and back into my mom&rsquo;s and then when I was 17</p>
<p>I moved out of my mom&rsquo;s again and back into my dad&rsquo;s house and</p>
<p>Every single time it&rsquo;s such a hard fucking thing to navigate and it&rsquo;s such a hard thing to do</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a very hard decision to make because when you have your parents like that and they&rsquo;re split</p>
<p>They kind of take it as like a betrayal or at least like one of mine did they would make it like this huge fucking</p>
<p>Betrayal of like picking the other one over the other</p>
<p>So along with making the hard decision of what was best for little me at the time every time I&rsquo;d have to choose which household</p>
<p>To go to it came with repairing the relationships with my parents</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a lot of reasons why that was a very hard decision to make constantly</p>
<p>But then my senior year of high school</p>
<p>I wanted a fresh start and I wanted to just kind of like say fuck it and change school</p>
<p>So my senior year of high school</p>
<p>I literally switched to a whole new school whole new everything and didn&rsquo;t know anybody didn&rsquo;t know anything and I did it</p>
<p>It was a hard decision to make but my tolerance for making hard decisions is very high and I don&rsquo;t regret that decision at all</p>
<p>But it was very scary and there&rsquo;s a lot of decisions people want to make it</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of things you guys write in to me about and ask like what to do</p>
<p>And I want to share some of the hard decisions that I&rsquo;ve made so you can get like inspiration, but also</p>
<p>Know that I&rsquo;m credible to talk about this shit with you</p>
<p>But another hard decision I had to make was quitting my first nursing job and I went through nursing school</p>
<p>Graduated started working where I precepted so basically at the end of nursing school you work in a hospital for six months for free</p>
<p>Under a nurse, but you&rsquo;re basically doing all the nursing responsibilities</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just not on your license</p>
<p>And then when you graduate you can go work wherever you want</p>
<p>Typically people get hired on where they precept and that&rsquo;s what I did</p>
<p>so I started working with who I precepted with in that department at that hospital and</p>
<p>Coming to the decision to leave that job after</p>
<p>Literally like three weeks. I think I think it was like a month</p>
<p>I made it a month as an actual nurse there, but like when I was a student there it was way different</p>
<p>So I basically was there for seven months</p>
<p>I worked there six months for free not as like an official nurse and then when I was a nurse</p>
<p>I lasted a month and</p>
<p>Coming to the decision to fucking leave that job was the scariest fucking shit</p>
<p>It was like it felt like everything I worked for</p>
<p>To get through nursing school was there and I had to choose to leave it because I wasn&rsquo;t happy with it</p>
<p>But honoring the way that you fucking feel will never bite you in the ass</p>
<p>But you can&rsquo;t just blindly trust your feelings. You have to be very logical</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where I&rsquo;m saying. I&rsquo;m gonna help you with everything</p>
<p>How to make the right decision another fucking hard decision probably the hardest one I&rsquo;ve ever made in my life</p>
<p>Was to choose to leave an ex of mine</p>
<p>Who was able to give me a lifestyle?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always dreamed of so like</p>
<p>spending a hundred thousand dollars a month flying all over the world eating the nicest shit buying the nicest shit like anything that you could</p>
<p>fucking dream of I was living it and</p>
<p>that was probably the hardest decision I&rsquo;ve ever had to make was to choose to leave that person because it was leaving that lifestyle to</p>
<p>And a lot of people think that making a decision is just like oh you lose one aspect</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so much more that goes into it. I&rsquo;m gonna teach you how to handle all of it</p>
<p>But that was a really hard fucking decision. Am I happy? I made it now</p>
<p>Yes, was I happy for the first year after I left fuck? No, it felt like the wrong decision</p>
<p>I felt like a fucking idiot</p>
<p>But I stuck to my values stuck to what mattered to me and got myself out of a very bad situation</p>
<p>Even though it was so fruitful</p>
<p>and then the last little decision that I wanted to talk about that I made was choosing to quit nursing entirely and pursue all of</p>
<p>My own personal dreams and desires and things and it&rsquo;s worked the fuck out. So</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s jump in to talking about the guy I met you can tell I&rsquo;m avoiding it</p>
<p>So when I was in LA, I met this guy and we hit it off from like the immediate moment that we met each other</p>
<p>It was like one of those</p>
<p>Like you just feel it and like the feelings was intense bitch</p>
<p>Like everything was just good. The chemistry was there the conversation was there the kissing was there like everything was fucking great</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t kiss till like the second or third night, but this guy I met was like really fucking cool</p>
<p>we vibed very well, and it takes a lot to catch my attention and this motherfucker definitely caught it and</p>
<p>Feelings came to my Pisces I&rsquo;d be falling in love in two seconds</p>
<p>But this was all heightened like everything I was feeling about this person and about this</p>
<p>Situation was heightened because it was someone I also saw value in it was someone who&rsquo;s like in the lifestyle</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in and like doing all the shit that I do someone that gets it and like the way that we connected was just</p>
<p>like</p>
<p>weird like it was so crazy how fucking good it was and I&rsquo;ve been single for the last two years and</p>
<p>Something that I was it like two and a half Wow two and a half years. It&rsquo;s been what the fuck I was traumatized</p>
<p>But I truly forgot how good it feels to have someone you&rsquo;re interested in romantically</p>
<p>Like just that connection and the feelings and all the romantic shit like everything on that front</p>
<p>I forgot how good it is. And when I got it again my picky ass who I am now</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like when I finally met someone that matched it</p>
<p>I was like what the fuck like it was nuts and it was just like I forgot how overwhelming and good it feels to have a</p>
<p>Person but basically we were compatible on all fronts like everything&rsquo;s fucking great</p>
<p>But there is one thing about myself</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know fully yet and usually I&rsquo;m into masculine guys. That&rsquo;s my fucking preference. That&rsquo;s my type</p>
<p>Myself is my type myself just shorter and you can have hair</p>
<p>But the guy that I met was not</p>
<p>Masculine and that was the only real hang-up that I had but I was so overwhelmed by how I felt toward him</p>
<p>I was blinded by it and it made me question if I even had that hang-up like is</p>
<p>Masculinity really something that I&rsquo;m after because of how good I felt and like the way that shit was I was like I can&rsquo;t overlook</p>
<p>It and I literally was like having to call into question. Is this even something I&rsquo;m hung up about like it made me question myself</p>
<p>And what I like and what I prefer and what I desire and feeling so many things so fast</p>
<p>made me think I didn&rsquo;t care about it and</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>Fully was just like in the moment and was just fucking feeling it and had a good-ass time</p>
<p>No, we did not have sex. Nothing like that happened. The most we did was like make out and cuddle</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t fuck like that and I make that very clear to everyone that I meet you don&rsquo;t get access to me like that</p>
<p>It takes a lot and it takes me</p>
<p>Getting to know somebody and like a lot more than that, you know</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a commitment I made to myself and you don&rsquo;t just get access no more. Nobody. I don&rsquo;t give a fuck</p>
<p>But when I was in LA we hung out every fucking day I was there and then when I came home from LA</p>
<p>We were texting and talking on the phone all the fucking time and like four hours a night</p>
<p>I was talking to him on the phone and we were having like deep-ass conversations</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s shit that like gets me off is like when someone can keep up mentally</p>
<p>He could keep up and a lot of people are scared to talk about certain topics and deep things. He was with it</p>
<p>He liked it just as much as I did and I was so taken back like what the fuck like you mentally stimulate me</p>
<p>Oh my god, that&rsquo;s hard, but also with that like having someone to talk to and</p>
<p>Feel cared about and feel checked in on and like having the excitement to like talk to somebody</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s something that I didn&rsquo;t realize that I missed. I forgot about that</p>
<p>Like I said, I&rsquo;ve been single for two and a half years</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of things that came up that I forgot how great they were and I forgot how strong those feelings were</p>
<p>but one of the biggest things that I missed about like having a person is</p>
<p>Someone to call when you&rsquo;re upset and like get comfort like comfort from your partner or like your person that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>Interested in or dealing with that feels so good</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how to fucking explain it</p>
<p>But like I have plenty of people I can call I call my mom call my sister call my friends like I have people I</p>
<p>Can go to for comfort. I just forgot what it&rsquo;s like to have like an</p>
<p>intimate</p>
<p>person</p>
<p>Comfort you and it&rsquo;s good. It&rsquo;s different. It&rsquo;s nice</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t realize I missed it. But now going through such a long period of being single</p>
<p>I appreciate these things when I have them even more. So this whole situation was just like too good to fucking be true and</p>
<p>I was so into it and I was like eating it up</p>
<p>But the way we communicated was so fucking adult and mature and like like I said, he kept up mentally</p>
<p>he kept up with everything and was just able to hang like the emotional maturity like the</p>
<p>Conversation style the communication like everything was just like on my level which is extremely hard to find</p>
<p>Like according to my past, I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s hard to find but I ain&rsquo;t found a shit for a goddamn while</p>
<p>Well, actually I haven&rsquo;t found it</p>
<p>It is hard to find</p>
<p>But basically he asked me one night like everything was great and he asked me and was like will you give me your word?</p>
<p>That if something comes up</p>
<p>Where you no longer want to like pursue things romantically and get to know each other like that</p>
<p>Just tell me and I said yes, like I&rsquo;ll give you my word that if something comes up</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you but I don&rsquo;t see anything right now and we both expressed how much we liked each other and everything was so</p>
<p>Like literally fucking perfect, but I did give him my word that if something came up</p>
<p>I would tell him and then something came up</p>
<p>So one night we were talking he asked me if there was anything he needed to be concerned about</p>
<p>Dealing with me in a romantic way and I said the only real like concern that I have not that you need to be concerned</p>
<p>About anything, but the only thing going on with me</p>
<p>I was just honest about the way that I was feeling was typically my type is masculine guys</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m starting to question if that really even matters because of like the way I feel toward you</p>
<p>So like the only thing I would think is like once all the excitement wears off and the whole like overwhelming feelings thing</p>
<p>Settles down and we get more logical. Is that gonna come back up?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know but I will keep you posted and like tell you as I find out because I wasn&rsquo;t fully</p>
<p>100% set and like okay. I like masculine guys</p>
<p>Because of how strong the feelings were it made me question it</p>
<p>But after we talked about it, everything was fine</p>
<p>Like the whole thing of like me becoming aware of shit didn&rsquo;t set in till a couple days later</p>
<p>So I was still happy as could be love talking to him and like hanging down and like FaceTime</p>
<p>It was so cute after a few days my concern started to set in</p>
<p>About the masculinity thing because the whirlwind of emotions was calming down and like I was on a high</p>
<p>From going to LA and like everything that fucking happened literally life-changing</p>
<p>Then meeting him was a high and it was like all these huge emotions were like so up in the air and so much was</p>
<p>Going on in LA. I didn&rsquo;t have time to process shit</p>
<p>so when I got back home and I finally could like check in with myself and like</p>
<p>for a second and like sort through what I was feeling and thinking my logical side kicked back in and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when the masculinity concern came back up and I was like</p>
<p>Fuck like Leo like I really think you do prefer</p>
<p>Masculine guys and that preference isn&rsquo;t wrong or bad. Like it&rsquo;s just a preference of mine and it&rsquo;s a desire of mine</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m attracted to</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t fucking control what I&rsquo;m attracted to and what I&rsquo;m not because if I could I would I wouldn&rsquo;t like men</p>
<p>but basically after sitting down and</p>
<p>Thinking and like assessing the way that I&rsquo;m feeling like a separate from everything else what I like what I desire is</p>
<p>Masculinity and a guy if I&rsquo;m gonna date you</p>
<p>So once I was certain and all that awareness hit me in the fucking head</p>
<p>I was just like god damn it because everything is so fucking difficult when you&rsquo;re aware like when you are more aware</p>
<p>Everything seems more difficult because you have so much more to take into consideration</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re aware of all of the parts of like the moving piece not just like your part</p>
<p>but once I knew masculinity was a non-negotiable for me a</p>
<p>big sense of doom and</p>
<p>guilt set in because I knew I&rsquo;d have to end it and</p>
<p>I really didn&rsquo;t fucking want to because like I said</p>
<p>It felt so good and all of the emotional feelings and the mental things were still there</p>
<p>It was just a matter of like a physical hang-up where I wasn&rsquo;t really gonna be attracted</p>
<p>To him physically, but like everything else was connected and there and it was the weirdest kind of like mindfuck</p>
<p>where nothing had gone wrong and nothing was like</p>
<p>Bad and I still felt such strong feelings for him</p>
<p>It was just a matter of my new awareness and what I was gonna choose to do because of it</p>
<p>But the doom feeling and the feeling of like dread was like fuck if I do decide to end things</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna have to like cut off all these good feelings that I have now like having someone to talk to and all the romantic</p>
<p>shit that I talked about that I missed so much this all made me realize how much I missed it and</p>
<p>Now I was like potentially gonna have to get rid of it and like cut all that off that fucking sucks</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not that going back to being single and like not entertaining anyone is bad</p>
<p>I like that because I&rsquo;m busy but</p>
<p>This whole situation made me aware of a lot of voids</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know that I had and things that I would like to experience</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like okay, I had this fucking void come to my awareness</p>
<p>full and</p>
<p>Then I have a new awareness that makes me want to change the situation and now I have this fucking void</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know that I had and I&rsquo;m about to have to fucking empty it. Ah</p>
<p>Ah</p>
<p>So here was my thought process around coming to the decision around ending things or just continuing forward so</p>
<p>Basically, I asked myself. How long are you gonna be selfish now that you know, this person is not someone you would ever like fully date</p>
<p>How long you gonna be selfish because to keep going forward? Yeah, you get all these positive emotions</p>
<p>You get to feel all these things you get to have the safety of knowing it&rsquo;s gonna end so you don&rsquo;t get too attached</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna have this person getting attached to you and it&rsquo;s gonna feel good for you</p>
<p>But you feeling good is at the expense of them. So how long you gonna be selfish?</p>
<p>how long you gonna allow this to go on because now I&rsquo;m a fucking piece of shit if I let it go on too long and</p>
<p>When you truly care about other people a lot of people have a fucked up version of love and caring about someone</p>
<p>When you truly care for someone you cannot feel joy at their expense</p>
<p>If you know the person you care about is gonna be hurt or is hurt you cannot feel joy at the same time</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a giant disconnect</p>
<p>There has to be so much</p>
<p>Disconnected in between you for you to be on such different pages if you truly care about someone you hold the way that they feel</p>
<p>Right next to how you feel. So if something&rsquo;s fucking with them, it&rsquo;s fucking with you. So there&rsquo;s not gonna be any you feel good</p>
<p>They feel bad when you truly care. So, you know, I always overthink things and I read too much into shit</p>
<p>this is where I</p>
<p>Read into the situation and got very clear about the reality of it because your decision you need to make becomes very clear when you</p>
<p>Face the fucking truth of it because in this situation what was truly gonna happen was I could choose to make myself</p>
<p>be okay with him, even though it doesn&rsquo;t fit my standards and make him enough and</p>
<p>live with that and that means neglecting the desire that I have and living with that or</p>
<p>I can choose to cut it off and then deal with all of the painful emotions that are gonna come from losing all of this</p>
<p>Both sides are painful</p>
<p>Which pain that I want to choose and that is something you need to fucking get about making any decision</p>
<p>There is pain on both sides. You&rsquo;re just not seeing one of them</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s when you feel like torn is you don&rsquo;t see like the truth of each side</p>
<p>So when I looked at it like that</p>
<p>I was like fuck because it put me in a position of choose him or choose myself</p>
<p>I could choose to honor my desire and honor the part of me that is attracted to masculine men or I can</p>
<p>Discard it and go for him. It became a me or him situation and I will never fucking pick someone over myself again</p>
<p>Everyone can eat shit me and little Leo come first</p>
<p>I talk about myself like multiple parts because I fucking am me my little protector aspect. That&rsquo;s another one</p>
<p>No one will come between us because anyone I&rsquo;ve let come between me and myself and all the parts of me has</p>
<p>Fucking ruined everything and fucked all of us up. So I&rsquo;ve got me and all my little parts and</p>
<p>No one&rsquo;s getting in the way of that. I&rsquo;ve made a commitment to myself a long time ago</p>
<p>I will never choose someone else over myself again, and that&rsquo;s fucking standing until my day</p>
<p>I die unless I have a kid then they come first, but this is a point</p>
<p>I really want to fucking drive home when you become aware of shit like this and a decision</p>
<p>It becomes very very clear what decision you have to make</p>
<p>so I knew at this point like I knew I had to cut it off because for me to</p>
<p>neglect my desire and not take myself into consideration and choose him and force myself to be okay with it and</p>
<p>Have that void in me for the rest of my life is living out of alignment with myself and what I desire</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;re supposed to live in line with your desires and what you want what you value and</p>
<p>For me to neglect part of myself is living out of alignment for authenticity and that is one of my biggest commitments for this fucking life</p>
<p>So after all that I knew I had to fucking cut it off and was it fucking hard bitch</p>
<p>Yes, and with realizing all this it put me in a whole different reality how before I was like</p>
<p>Oh, I might have to cut it off now</p>
<p>I knew I did have to cut it off because I faced the reality of the entire situation and it put me in a whole</p>
<p>New one my relationship with myself was on the line</p>
<p>My character and my values were being tested was I gonna act in line with them or not?</p>
<p>And you best believe I fucking did so I knew I had to call him and if I was in person</p>
<p>I would have done it in person because I would have given him a hug so that he knew</p>
<p>How much I did care and can feel it. You know what I mean, but I couldn&rsquo;t so I would had to FaceTime and</p>
<p>I was so fucking anxious for the call and I knew what I had to do and I felt so bad because I knew I</p>
<p>Was gonna hurt him but lying was not an option. I don&rsquo;t do that</p>
<p>I had to be very straight up and honest</p>
<p>Like I said authenticity you got to be fucking real you got to tell the truth</p>
<p>Even when it fucking hurts you or them and this situation it was gonna hurt both of us</p>
<p>Like I said, I&rsquo;m gonna have to literally get rid of all these great things</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve just experienced and like the feelings that I didn&rsquo;t know that I missed but also I was gonna have to hurt him</p>
<p>It was a double-edged fucking sword. But when my relationship with myself was on the line, I&rsquo;m fine throwing it</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll both get cut and one thing about me is when I start feeling anxious</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just do what the fuck I need to do</p>
<p>So I was so anxious for this call and I was like, oh I call my mom. I call my sister</p>
<p>I called like all my friends and was like, oh I have to do it and they were like</p>
<p>Yeah, you have to fucking do it</p>
<p>like this is who you are like act in line with it and I was like I&rsquo;m going to I just don&rsquo;t want to</p>
<p>So I was like, alright, I&rsquo;m gonna call him tonight and it was like 3 p.m</p>
<p>And like as the day was going on, I was just more and more anxious about it</p>
<p>So I was like fuck it just call him now</p>
<p>So I text him asked if he was free and called him immediately was I ready?</p>
<p>No, was I fucking wanting to have this conversation?</p>
<p>No</p>
<p>but I just did it instead of waiting like instead of forcing myself to deal with that anxiety and like the all day long I</p>
<p>Wanted to like relieve myself from it. So I just faced the fucking challenge up front</p>
<p>Okay</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just get it over with and one thing is he was having a good day</p>
<p>Like when he answered the phone he was having such a good day and I felt so bad because I was like fuck I have</p>
<p>To ruin it</p>
<p>But basically I told him</p>
<p>straight up and honestly</p>
<p>What was going on what I felt and what it meant like it&rsquo;s not gonna go forward anymore</p>
<p>In a romantic way and I was very honest like just genuine and honest</p>
<p>I was sure I didn&rsquo;t sugarcoat shit</p>
<p>But I said things in a way where he knew it wasn&rsquo;t about him and nothing&rsquo;s wrong with him for being this way</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just my preference. You know what I mean?</p>
<p>Like you have to be considerate and I wanted to make sure</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t start beating himself up and I wanted to make sure anything he was thinking I could clear it up</p>
<p>Before he made an assumption or like a judgment that would hurt himself and then run with it</p>
<p>Like I wanted to prevent him from turning the knife at himself for like not being good enough XYZ</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t fucking like that shit</p>
<p>So we had a really good conversation and he handled it very well and he appreciated the honesty</p>
<p>But I didn&rsquo;t ghost him and I didn&rsquo;t lie and make up some excuse and I&rsquo;m gonna tell you why</p>
<p>First with ghosting if you just like remove yourself out of someone&rsquo;s life</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna fuck them up bad</p>
<p>and like I said</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t do something to someone if you truly care about them knowing it&rsquo;s gonna hurt them and walk away being fine</p>
<p>so to go someone</p>
<p>Gives you no closure</p>
<p>It gives you no explanation and someone&rsquo;s brain is just gonna run fucking free trying to find</p>
<p>all of the reasons why it could have ended or what happened or what was wrong and</p>
<p>If you are insecure your brains automatically gonna jump to all of your insecurities ghosting someone literally traps them in like</p>
<p>Hell their own personal hell of questioning over evaluating over analyzing and it will run your brain fucking stupid</p>
<p>so I didn&rsquo;t want to do that to him and</p>
<p>then to lie to him and make some kind of excuse for like why we couldn&rsquo;t be together or</p>
<p>why I wasn&rsquo;t looking for a relationship or any bullshit like that is it would do kind of the same thing of like leaving him</p>
<p>wondering and</p>
<p>Attacking himself like why he wasn&rsquo;t good enough or like if I was good enough</p>
<p>Leo would make time for me. So for me to just go about oh, I&rsquo;m not ready for a relationship</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an excuse because if someone&rsquo;s good enough and they value you enough</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll make time for you and I preach that shit and I stand on that shit, so I</p>
<p>Wasn&rsquo;t gonna just say that because he would have been like, oh I was enough</p>
<p>but I wasn&rsquo;t good enough to date like I wasn&rsquo;t worth putting the effort into and I didn&rsquo;t want him to have that because that</p>
<p>sends you on the scavenger hunt of oh</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s wrong with me? Why wasn&rsquo;t I enough?</p>
<p>Why didn&rsquo;t he like me that much and I also reassured him that this conversation was very hard for me to have and I didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>want to end things and I didn&rsquo;t want to like</p>
<p>Lose the connection that we had because it felt so fucking good and like the same way he felt I felt and I reassured him</p>
<p>About I was like you&rsquo;re not the only one hurt by this and it fucking pains me to say it</p>
<p>then I don&rsquo;t want to do this, but I have to look out for you and</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>Want to hurt you more than I have to like for me to tell him as soon as I became aware of it</p>
<p>Would hurt him a little bit</p>
<p>But for me to just go months down the line and let him get more and more attached and us keep</p>
<p>Like being a thing and like I&rsquo;m over here kind of like detached because I know it&rsquo;s not gonna go everywhere</p>
<p>But he&rsquo;s getting attached. I&rsquo;d have to fucking crush him in the future</p>
<p>so the quicker I could get it out was sparing him and</p>
<p>Me because you do get invested no matter how like long things go</p>
<p>but I made it very clear that my decision was like to look out for both of us and</p>
<p>Especially him and it caused me a lot of discomfort and a lot of pain to even fucking say this and do this</p>
<p>But like but I made it very clear</p>
<p>It was in both of our best interests and he really appreciated it</p>
<p>But honestly when you&rsquo;re trying to make a decision about something when you look at the true reality of the situation</p>
<p>it makes it a lot less enjoyable because I was so blind with all of my good feelings and all this shit and I was</p>
<p>Just able to like freely just blindly run into it and feel all these good things</p>
<p>But when I truly sat down and looked at the reality of the situation how I&rsquo;m getting enjoyment</p>
<p>But he&rsquo;s on the line like his feelings are at the expense of me feeling good when you see that</p>
<p>It becomes a lot less enjoyable. You can&rsquo;t just blindly just go and like feel good and be a happy dick</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a fucking dick if you go along with it, but you have to wake up</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why like</p>
<p>Looking into shit and reflecting is so important and going forward with all the new awareness that I had of him being at the expense</p>
<p>For me to just keep it to myself and talk to him like normal. It&rsquo;s no longer gonna feel good to talk</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s no longer gonna feel good to have him in my life</p>
<p>Knowing this shit in the back of my head because it comes with guilt like the longer I go along</p>
<p>I knew I was gonna hurt him worse. So even for me to just continue talking again, like nothing happened</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t know what was going on in my head</p>
<p>But a relationship is a commitment to communicate speak the fuck up</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t get in one if you&rsquo;re not ready to communicate</p>
<p>Even if it&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s going on inside you your partner deserves to fucking know because for them to get romantically involved with you</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re both on the line</p>
<p>But I couldn&rsquo;t have just kept talking to him without feeling guilt without feeling like shit and I didn&rsquo;t want to have to deal</p>
<p>With that, but that&rsquo;s where I said</p>
<p>I shifted into a whole new reality once I became aware of all this my life before where I was blind and happy was gone</p>
<p>Once I became aware of like my true desire</p>
<p>I was like fuck and like switched me into a new reality where I&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>Shit, you know, there was no going back</p>
<p>There was no going back to what we had and how things were like once that awareness is there</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s there and that&rsquo;s why I always say awareness is a fucking curse</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a bitch, but it&rsquo;s a blessing but it&rsquo;s just hard to see it sometimes</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s really easy to try and just focus on the good times</p>
<p>and if someone is not aware, they&rsquo;re gonna try and like focus on the good times and focus on how it felt when we were</p>
<p>first together and</p>
<p>Discard the fact that like you&rsquo;re not into them physically for like the masculinity aspect</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just gonna try and jump back and think oh if I just don&rsquo;t tell them I can keep having this</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re checked out of the way that you feel if you can do that</p>
<p>but basically I had to accept the new position I was in and</p>
<p>Base my decisions off of that not what could have been and not what we did have</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like I had to get square in the reality of right now</p>
<p>Once I realized this desire of mine is not one that&rsquo;s negotiable</p>
<p>It put me in a whole new standpoint and you have to make your decision based off of that reality</p>
<p>Not a past one not how good things were not what it could be</p>
<p>Not how can I talk myself out of this desire and make myself just accept him and like him?</p>
<p>How can I neglect myself to go forward?</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t waste time doing that shit when you want something you can&rsquo;t not want it</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no way around it. Your desire is your desire for a fucking reason. You can&rsquo;t get rid of it</p>
<p>You can meet it in certain other ways</p>
<p>But you can&rsquo;t unwant something and it&rsquo;s just gonna cause you more and more pain if you go against it</p>
<p>So the only option you have if you truly want to have a good life and be happy is to follow that shit</p>
<p>So I have one more thing to say and then I&rsquo;m gonna tell you how I comforted myself through this situation</p>
<p>Cuz I boohoo&rsquo;d like a bitch</p>
<p>Flip the roles if you don&rsquo;t know what decision to make right now or you don&rsquo;t know what to do about something</p>
<p>Flip the roles. How would you want someone to handle you if you were in the opposite position?</p>
<p>so like if he became aware that</p>
<p>He only likes feminine guys and doesn&rsquo;t like masculine guys or he doesn&rsquo;t like guys who are six foot seven my big ass</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, oh I like guys who are short</p>
<p>what I want him to make some excuse and</p>
<p>Lie to me so it saved my feelings or what I want him to ghost me</p>
<p>No, and when you make up a lie to try and save someone feelings you actually hurt them worse</p>
<p>Like I said, you send them on that goose chase of like trying to figure out why they&rsquo;re not good enough</p>
<p>What I appreciate if homeboy would have just came to me and said I like shorter guys</p>
<p>I would get it like I would fully appreciate that way more. So that&rsquo;s another way</p>
<p>I knew I&rsquo;d like needed to make that decision</p>
<p>I knew I needed to do it, but that&rsquo;s just a good way to know how to handle something is flip it</p>
<p>How would you want to handle it if you were on the receiving end? So the night that I ended things</p>
<p>When I got off the phone, I felt relieved that I handled the situation, right?</p>
<p>But it lasted like a few hours of like feeling okay</p>
<p>and then at night I got very very sad because that was the time that I typically would like talk to him for four hours and</p>
<p>A big thing people don&rsquo;t realize about relationships or dealing with someone romantically or anything like that</p>
<p>You get in a routine of talking to someone and having that person in a certain spot in your life</p>
<p>And when they&rsquo;re out of it, you&rsquo;re still used to that routine</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s just gonna take you a minute of building a new routine and adjusting to their absence</p>
<p>Before it becomes okay</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna be uncomfortable for a minute</p>
<p>But as soon as you get out of the habit of talking to someone and living with someone and interacting with someone</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t really think about him that much you&rsquo;re gonna think about him a lot until you break that</p>
<p>but that time came where I usually would call him and I just got super fucking sad and</p>
<p>So I tapped into the shit</p>
<p>I put on some sad ass music put on some Ethel Cain and I just fucking like laid on the couch and I was like</p>
<p>Leo you&rsquo;re not crying over this but I was just sitting there and I was running through everything in my head and I knew I</p>
<p>Handled it, right</p>
<p>but I still had the feeling of like loss because I did just lose something that I valued a lot and the thing that sent</p>
<p>me over the edge and made me start fucking bawling was</p>
<p>that I hurt him and</p>
<p>I knew I had to and it was just part of it</p>
<p>but I still just felt so bad that I had to hurt this person because they were very good to me like everything was great</p>
<p>And I saw so much value in them and I&rsquo;m like to have to hurt them</p>
<p>I felt so bad about it</p>
<p>But like I always say when you are emotional and you&rsquo;re upset do not fucking act do not act do not do shit</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t reach out to them. Don&rsquo;t talk to them</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t fucking post on social media lay your ass on the couch and fucking cry put on some music put it up louder and fucking</p>
<p>Cry do not act when you&rsquo;re highly emotional because you&rsquo;re not rational how&rsquo;d I would have text him?</p>
<p>It would have made shit just way worse. I had to just get myself through this wave of heavy-ass sadness</p>
<p>And the more you do this the more you&rsquo;ll get better at comforting yourself</p>
<p>So like I was literally just sitting on the couch and I was just like</p>
<p>Thinking like I&rsquo;m so sorry</p>
<p>that I fucking hurt you and I was having to talk to myself and comfort myself and</p>
<p>Tell myself it was okay</p>
<p>And I was like, I&rsquo;m just feel so fucking bad and I was like talking to myself like I know like I know</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry and like being there for yourself will change</p>
<p>Everything for you as soon as you can kind of like do the two points of perspective and comfort yourself</p>
<p>Shit everything changes and I literally like just fucking boo-hooed and cried and was sad and I felt</p>
<p>Through it. I didn&rsquo;t try to get away from it. I just felt it all</p>
<p>I let myself just fucking cry it out and get these feelings out. Just let that energy just purge itself and then I</p>
<p>Felt better and I got up and I had a little snack and then I did some work and then I went to bed</p>
<p>and I haven&rsquo;t cried about it again because I felt it fully and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so relieved and so happy with how I handle that situation like looking back now</p>
<p>I know it was hard and while I was going through it, it was so fucking difficult, but I do not regret it at all</p>
<p>I know I hurt him</p>
<p>But it was a matter of hurt him a little or crush him in the future and I&rsquo;d rather just like take</p>
<p>The little I&rsquo;ll just hurt you a little like I&rsquo;m fucking sorry</p>
<p>But my confidence in myself has boosted to like all my morals all my character traits</p>
<p>Everything that I value still stands because I acted in line with it</p>
<p>Had I gone against it, I&rsquo;d feel like dogshit and I would be so worried</p>
<p>But now I get to have no guilt because I handled it, right?</p>
<p>I have no guilt or worry that anyone can go and talk bad about me or talk down on my character</p>
<p>You fucking can&rsquo;t you could try it. Everybody knows you&rsquo;re full of fucking shit, and I&rsquo;m not talking at the person</p>
<p>He don&rsquo;t even watch my shit, but I&rsquo;m not talking at them</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just saying like anyone who&rsquo;s gonna try and talk bad about me. Try it, bitch</p>
<p>Try it my character just speaks for itself who I am</p>
<p>the interactions that I have the shit that I do the shit that I say people just get it like I am so</p>
<p>The opposite of what people say about me. Everybody knows to just write it off</p>
<p>but I get that confidence that I always will do what&rsquo;s right, even if it fucking hurts and</p>
<p>I feel closer to myself like every time I have a situation happen where I&rsquo;m very emotional and I&rsquo;m sad and I comfort myself</p>
<p>Like how I said, I talked to myself. I</p>
<p>Feel so much closer to myself and I feel safer with myself and I feel safe that I will do things that are difficult and</p>
<p>I will be there for myself when I go through them to help me get myself through them and I got myself through it and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m happy about it. Like I&rsquo;m so happy with myself. I&rsquo;m happy with</p>
<p>Everything really I have no doubt. I have no guilt like I completely got to like put this situation to rest</p>
<p>Properly and one thing I want to say is you will never regret looking out for people</p>
<p>so if you make a decision where you look out for someone don&rsquo;t neglect yourself like look out for yourself, but look out for other</p>
<p>people too if you can find a</p>
<p>Solution or an answer that takes both people into consideration always pick that one</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want to just do what&rsquo;s best for you</p>
<p>If you hurt someone else and you don&rsquo;t want to only do what&rsquo;s best for someone else if it hurts you like you have to</p>
<p>Take you both into consideration, but you will never regret doing that and</p>
<p>one thing I want to say that I learned from</p>
<p>my last relationship and</p>
<p>I just fucking proved bitch. I just fucking proved. I learned don&rsquo;t do it to me again</p>
<p>Do not wait for someone to fuck up for you to cut things off</p>
<p>If you become aware of something and you no longer want to be in a relationship</p>
<p>Take yourself and show yourself. I&rsquo;m getting the chills like I look like a plucked fucking chicken</p>
<p>Take yourself and show yourself</p>
<p>You do not need to be hurt for me to do what&rsquo;s best for you</p>
<p>You do not need to have someone hurt you for me to value the way that you feel if you no longer want to be</p>
<p>in this relationship</p>
<p>Nothing has to happen for you to feel justified the way you feel is enough to be taken into consideration</p>
<p>And I will take you into consideration because with past relationships</p>
<p>I would wait like I would come to the conclusion</p>
<p>I want to get the fuck out and then I would just sit there and I would wait for you to do one last</p>
<p>straw and I was out and</p>
<p>Do not do that do not fucking do that</p>
<p>It damages your relationship with yourself and it will completely fuck up the way that relationship ends because it&rsquo;s gonna be something small</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;ve been like tolerating shit, and it&rsquo;s just building you&rsquo;re like one more thing and I&rsquo;m fucking done with you</p>
<p>Typically, it&rsquo;s an overreaction and you&rsquo;re jumping on to that one thing that they do wrong</p>
<p>So you look fucking crazy had you communicated the way that you actually felt?</p>
<p>The person wouldn&rsquo;t feel so blindsided and that&rsquo;s one thing that&rsquo;s really important like don&rsquo;t force yourself to be hurt to feel justified</p>
<p>to leave you&rsquo;re allowed to leave just because you don&rsquo;t want it and</p>
<p>Because you don&rsquo;t feel fulfilled or you don&rsquo;t feel happy or you don&rsquo;t feel respected or you don&rsquo;t feel pretty and especially if you don&rsquo;t feel</p>
<p>Appreciated you&rsquo;re allowed to leave</p>
<p>You fully are allowed to leave just communicate it and talk about it and leave right?</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t wait for someone to fucking hurt you to leave</p>
<p>I proved that I won&rsquo;t do that</p>
<p>So stop sending me situations like this, bitch</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s one really big point</p>
<p>I want to bring up because the way that I feel right now is so much better than how I feel when</p>
<p>You do get that one last straw and you get to end it off that like that</p>
<p>The justification through anger of someone doing something to you. You&rsquo;re like, yeah now I&rsquo;m done with you. Fuck you</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll cut all ties that only lasts so long the anger will only make you feel justified for so long</p>
<p>But when you come to a logical decision and act based off of that</p>
<p>You never have to think back you you properly deal with the situation</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like you just throw a band-aid on a fucking stab wound and be like, oh like it&rsquo;s done</p>
<p>No, that&rsquo;s what that is when you wait for that last straw and then cut it off for that</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not the right way to handle it. I&rsquo;ve learned</p>
<p>So just take yourself into consideration</p>
<p>Show yourself you care about the way that you feel and you will not stay somewhere or with someone that you don&rsquo;t want to be</p>
<p>With do not neglect yourself</p>
<p>for anyone and</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all I got for this podcast episode</p>
