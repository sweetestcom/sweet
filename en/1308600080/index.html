    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>where we discuss science</p>
<p>and science-based tools for everyday life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Andrew Huberman,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology</p>
<p>at Stanford School of Medicine.</p>
<p>Today, my guest is Jeff Cavalier.</p>
<p>Jeff Cavalier holds a master of science in physical therapy</p>
<p>and is a certified strength and conditioning specialist.</p>
<p>He did his training at the University of Connecticut STORS,</p>
<p>one of the top five programs in the world</p>
<p>in physical therapy and sports medicine.</p>
<p>I discovered Jeff Cavalier over 10 years ago</p>
<p>from his online content.</p>
<p>His online content includes information</p>
<p>about how to train for strength,</p>
<p>how to train for hypertrophy, which is muscle growth,</p>
<p>how to train for endurance,</p>
<p>as well as how to rehabilitate injuries</p>
<p>to avoid muscular imbalances, nutrition,</p>
<p>and supplementation.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always found his content</p>
<p>to be incredibly science-based, incredibly clear,</p>
<p>sometimes surprising, and always incredibly actionable.</p>
<p>It is therefore not surprising</p>
<p>that he has one of the largest online platforms</p>
<p>for fitness, nutrition, supplementation,</p>
<p>and injury rehabilitation.</p>
<p>Jeff has also worked with an enormous number</p>
<p>of professional athletes</p>
<p>and has served as head physical therapist</p>
<p>and assistant strength coach for the New York Mets.</p>
<p>Again, the content that Jeff Cavalier has posted online</p>
<p>has been so immensely useful to me over the years</p>
<p>that I was absolutely thrilled</p>
<p>to get the chance to sit down with him</p>
<p>and ask him about everything from how to train</p>
<p>in terms of how to split up the body parts</p>
<p>that you train across the week,</p>
<p>how to integrate strength training and endurance training,</p>
<p>when to stretch, how to stretch.</p>
<p>Indeed, we talked about nutrition.</p>
<p>We talk a bit about supplementation.</p>
<p>We talk about how to really avoid creating imbalances</p>
<p>in muscle and in neural control over muscle.</p>
<p>This is one thing that&rsquo;s really wonderful about Jeff</p>
<p>is he really has an understanding</p>
<p>of not just how muscles and bones</p>
<p>and tendons and ligaments work together,</p>
<p>but how the nervous system interfaces with those.</p>
<p>We talked about the mental side of training,</p>
<p>including when to bring specific concentration</p>
<p>to the muscles that you&rsquo;re training</p>
<p>and when to think more about how to move weights</p>
<p>through space and think more about the movements overall.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m certain that you&rsquo;ll find the conversation</p>
<p>that we held to be immensely useful and informative</p>
<p>for your fitness practices</p>
<p>and also for how you mentally approach fitness in general</p>
<p>and how to set up a lifelong fitness practice,</p>
<p>one that will give you the strength that you desire,</p>
<p>one that will give you the aesthetic results</p>
<p>that you desire, one that will set you up</p>
<p>for endurance and cardiovascular health,</p>
<p>basically an overall fitness program.</p>
<p>I really feel this is where Jeff Cavalier shines</p>
<p>above and beyond so many of the other PTs</p>
<p>and fitness so-called influencers that are out there.</p>
<p>Again, everything is grounded in science.</p>
<p>Everything is clear and everything is actionable.</p>
<p>And while we do cover an enormous amount of information</p>
<p>during today&rsquo;s episode,</p>
<p>if you want to dive even deeper into that information,</p>
<p>you can go to athleanx.com</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;ll find some of Jeff&rsquo;s programs.</p>
<p>You can also find him at AthleanX on YouTube.</p>
<p>There you will find videos, for instance,</p>
<p>like the how to repair or heal from lower back pain,</p>
<p>something that I actually followed directly</p>
<p>long before I ever met Jeff, has over 32 million views.</p>
<p>And that is not by accident,</p>
<p>is because the protocols there, again,</p>
<p>are surprising and actionable.</p>
<p>They relieved my back pain very quickly without surgery.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m immensely grateful for that content.</p>
<p>And it extends into everything from, again,</p>
<p>hypertrophy, endurance, and strength training, and so on.</p>
<p>Again, it&rsquo;s athleanx.com as the website,</p>
<p>athleanx on YouTube, and also athleanx on Instagram.</p>
<p>The Huberman Lab Podcast is proud to announce</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve partnered with Momentus Supplements.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve done that for several reasons.</p>
<p>First of all,</p>
<p>the quality of their supplements is exceedingly high.</p>
<p>Second of all, we wanted to have a location</p>
<p>where you could find all of the supplements</p>
<p>discussed on the Huberman Lab Podcast</p>
<p>in one easy to find place.</p>
<p>You can now find that place at livemomentus.com</p>
<p>slash Huberman.</p>
<p>In addition, Momentus Supplements ship internationally,</p>
<p>something that a lot of other supplement companies</p>
<p>simply do not do.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s terrific whether or not you live in the US</p>
<p>or you live abroad.</p>
<p>Right now, not all of the supplements</p>
<p>that we discuss on the Huberman Lab Podcast are listed,</p>
<p>but that catalog of supplements</p>
<p>is being expanded very rapidly.</p>
<p>And a good number of them that we&rsquo;ve talked about,</p>
<p>some of the more prominent ones for sleep and focus</p>
<p>and other aspects of mental and physical health</p>
<p>are already there.</p>
<p>Again, you can find them at livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>Before we begin,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to emphasize that this podcast is separate</p>
<p>from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.</p>
<p>It is, however, part of my desire and effort</p>
<p>to bring zero cost to consumer information</p>
<p>about science and science related tools</p>
<p>to the general public.</p>
<p>In keeping with that theme,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank the sponsors of today&rsquo;s podcast.</p>
<p>Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens.</p>
<p>Athletic Greens is an all-in-one</p>
<p>vitamin mineral probiotic drink.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been taking Athletic Greens since 2012,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m delighted that they&rsquo;re sponsoring the podcast.</p>
<p>The reason I started taking Athletic Greens</p>
<p>and the reason I still take Athletic Greens</p>
<p>once or twice a day is that it helps me cover</p>
<p>all of my basic nutritional needs.</p>
<p>It makes up for any deficiencies that I might have.</p>
<p>In addition, it has probiotics,</p>
<p>which are vital for microbiome health.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done a couple of episodes now</p>
<p>on the so-called gut microbiome</p>
<p>and the ways in which the microbiome interacts</p>
<p>with your immune system, with your brain to regulate mood,</p>
<p>and essentially with every biological system</p>
<p>relevant to health throughout your brain and body.</p>
<p>With Athletic Greens, I get the vitamins I need,</p>
<p>the minerals I need, and the probiotics</p>
<p>to support my microbiome.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Athletic Greens,</p>
<p>you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>and claim a special offer.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll give you five free travel packs,</p>
<p>plus a year supply of vitamin D3K2.</p>
<p>There are a ton of data now showing that vitamin D3</p>
<p>is essential for various aspects</p>
<p>of our brain and body health.</p>
<p>Even if we&rsquo;re getting a lot of sunshine,</p>
<p>many of us are still deficient in vitamin D3.</p>
<p>And K2 is also important because it regulates things</p>
<p>like cardiovascular function, calcium in the body,</p>
<p>and so on.</p>
<p>Again, go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>to claim the special offer of the five free travel packs</p>
<p>and the year supply of vitamin D3K2.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Element.</p>
<p>Element is an electrolyte drink</p>
<p>that has everything you need and nothing you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>That means the exact ratios of electrolytes are an element,</p>
<p>and those are sodium, magnesium, and potassium,</p>
<p>but it has no sugar.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked many times before on this podcast</p>
<p>about the key role of hydration and electrolytes</p>
<p>for nerve cell function, neuron function,</p>
<p>as well as the function of all the cells</p>
<p>and all the tissues and organ systems of the body.</p>
<p>If we have sodium, magnesium, and potassium</p>
<p>present in the proper ratios,</p>
<p>all of those cells function properly,</p>
<p>and all our bodily systems can be optimized.</p>
<p>If the electrolytes are not present,</p>
<p>and if hydration is low,</p>
<p>we simply can&rsquo;t think as well as we would otherwise,</p>
<p>our mood is off, hormone systems go off,</p>
<p>our ability to get into physical action,</p>
<p>to engage in endurance and strength,</p>
<p>and all sorts of other things is diminished.</p>
<p>So with Element, you can make sure</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re staying on top of your hydration</p>
<p>and that you&rsquo;re getting the proper ratios of electrolytes.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Element, you can go to drinkelement,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s lmnt.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll get a free Element sample pack</p>
<p>with your purchase.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all delicious.</p>
<p>So again, if you want to try Element,</p>
<p>you can go to elementlmnt.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Thesis.</p>
<p>Thesis makes what are called nootropics,</p>
<p>which means smart drugs.</p>
<p>Now, to be honest, I am not a fan of the term nootropics.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe in smart drugs in the sense that</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe that there&rsquo;s any one substance</p>
<p>or collection of substances that can make us smarter.</p>
<p>I do believe based on science, however,</p>
<p>that there are particular neural circuits</p>
<p>and brain functions that allow us to be more focused,</p>
<p>more alert, access creativity, be more motivated, et cetera.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just the way that the brain works,</p>
<p>different neural circuits for different brain states.</p>
<p>Thesis understands this.</p>
<p>And as far as I know, they&rsquo;re the first nootropics company</p>
<p>to create targeted nootropics for specific outcomes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Thesis for more than six months now,</p>
<p>and I can confidently say that their nootropics</p>
<p>have been a total game changer.</p>
<p>My go-to formula is the clarity formula,</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m pleased to announce that the Huberman Lab Podcast</p>
<p>is now partnered with Momentus Supplements.</p>
<p>We partnered with Momentus for several important reasons.</p>
<p>First of all, they ship internationally</p>
<p>because we know that many of you are located</p>
<p>outside of the United States.</p>
<p>Second of all, and perhaps most important,</p>
<p>the quality of their supplements is second to none,</p>
<p>both in terms of purity and precision</p>
<p>of the amounts of the ingredients.</p>
<p>Third, we&rsquo;ve really emphasized supplements</p>
<p>that are single ingredient supplements,</p>
<p>and that are supplied in dosages</p>
<p>that allow you to build a supplementation protocol</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for cost,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for effectiveness,</p>
<p>and that you can add things and remove things</p>
<p>from your protocol in a way</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really systematic and scientific.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to see the supplements</p>
<p>that we partner with Momentus on,</p>
<p>you can go to livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>There you&rsquo;ll see those supplements,</p>
<p>and just keep in mind that we are constantly expanding</p>
<p>the library of supplements available through Momentus</p>
<p>on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>And now for my discussion with Jeff Cavalier.</p>
<p>Jeff, such a pleasure for me to have you here.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad to be here, it&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a longtime consumer of your content.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve learned a tremendous amount about fitness,</p>
<p>both in the weight room, cardio, nutrition,</p>
<p>things that I&rsquo;ve applied for over a decade.</p>
<p>So for me, this is particularly meaningful.</p>
<p>And my goal here is really to ask a bunch of questions</p>
<p>to which I&rsquo;m interested in the answers,</p>
<p>but also for which I know the audience</p>
<p>is really curious about.</p>
<p>So one of your mantras is,</p>
<p>if you wanna look like an athlete, train like an athlete.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s something really special</p>
<p>that sets aside what you do</p>
<p>from what a lot of other very well-qualified people do.</p>
<p>And in terms of the use of weights and resistance,</p>
<p>whether or not it&rsquo;s body weight or weights in the gym</p>
<p>or pulleys versus cardio,</p>
<p>in terms of overall health, aesthetics, and athleticism,</p>
<p>is there a way that you could point to</p>
<p>the idea that maybe people should be doing</p>
<p>50% resistance training and 50% cardio?</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s 70-30, maybe it&rsquo;s 30-70.</p>
<p>And here I&rsquo;m talking about the typical person</p>
<p>who would like to maintain or maybe even add</p>
<p>some muscle mass, probably in particular areas</p>
<p>for most people, as opposed to just overall mass,</p>
<p>although we&rsquo;ll talk about that later.</p>
<p>And people who wanna maintain</p>
<p>a relatively low body fat percentage</p>
<p>and being good cardiovascular health.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the sort of contour of a basic program</p>
<p>that anybody could think about as a starting place?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s like a 60-40 split,</p>
<p>which would be leaning towards weight training,</p>
<p>strength and then either the conditioning aspect</p>
<p>be about 40%.</p>
<p>So if you look at it over the course of a training week,</p>
<p>I mean, five days in a gym would be a great task.</p>
<p>And obviously not in the gym, it could be done at home,</p>
<p>but three days strength training,</p>
<p>Monday, Wednesday, Friday, conditioning,</p>
<p>Tuesday, Thursday, two days.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a pretty easy roundabout way to split that up,</p>
<p>of course, depending upon training goals.</p>
<p>And as you said, the aesthetic goals,</p>
<p>like that will shift dramatically.</p>
<p>But if you wanna see the benefits of both,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s probably the effective dose for strength training</p>
<p>and the effective dose for conditioning</p>
<p>at the bare minimum level.</p>
<p>Again, being a much better performer conditioning wise,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna wanna do more than that.</p>
<p>And in terms of the duration of those workouts,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s your suggestion?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been weight training for about 30 years,</p>
<p>running for about 30 years and mainly for health</p>
<p>and have found that if I work hard in the gym</p>
<p>or at resistance training for more than 60 minutes or so,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very hard for me to recover.</p>
<p>I start getting colds,</p>
<p>I start getting weaker from workout to workout.</p>
<p>But amazingly, at least to me,</p>
<p>if I keep those workouts to about 10 minutes of warmup</p>
<p>and 50, five, zero minutes or so of really hard work</p>
<p>for resistance training,</p>
<p>and I keep the cardiovascular work</p>
<p>to about 30 to 45 minutes, I feel great.</p>
<p>And I seem to make some progress at least someplace</p>
<p>in the workout from workout to workout.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, those are good numbers</p>
<p>because those are kind of numbers that we usually preach.</p>
<p>We try to keep our workouts to an hour or less if possible.</p>
<p>Now, depending upon the split that you&rsquo;re following,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re on a total body split,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s just gonna be more that has to be done</p>
<p>in a given amount of time.</p>
<p>That, and again, if you&rsquo;re training primarily for strength,</p>
<p>that could prolong the workout</p>
<p>because the longer rest times in between sets.</p>
<p>But in general, when you&rsquo;re not focused on that one aspect,</p>
<p>but the overall health picture,</p>
<p>then you can get the job done in under an hour.</p>
<p>And again, I always say,</p>
<p>on top of if you wanna look like an athlete,</p>
<p>train like an athlete,</p>
<p>is you can either train long or you can train hard,</p>
<p>but you can&rsquo;t do both.</p>
<p>And I really believe that the focus for me,</p>
<p>I have a busy life,</p>
<p>I have a lot of other things that I do, believe it or not.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, I wanna go hard and I wanna go get out.</p>
<p>And I find that my body also responds to that.</p>
<p>I think a lot of guys&rsquo; bodies respond to that.</p>
<p>And particularly, as you start to get older,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s the length of the workout</p>
<p>that actually causes more problems</p>
<p>than the intensity of what you&rsquo;re doing,</p>
<p>particularly if you&rsquo;re warmed up properly, like you said.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve found personally that my warmup</p>
<p>has had to become more of an integral part of my workout</p>
<p>than it ever has before.</p>
<p>I never, I could get in the gym when I was 20</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m going right over, I&rsquo;m doing the one set, two sets,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in and I&rsquo;m ready to go.</p>
<p>And I never do another workout warmup set</p>
<p>for any of the other exercises I do the rest of the day.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not true anymore.</p>
<p>And I found that as long as I&rsquo;m willing</p>
<p>to sort of give myself a little bit of a warmup,</p>
<p>the intensity is not what bothers me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very much in control of the weights that I use</p>
<p>and it doesn&rsquo;t bother me.</p>
<p>But if I start to go pretty long,</p>
<p>I start to feel achy or I start to have problems.</p>
<p>So again, depending upon age,</p>
<p>that also plays a factor in the length.</p>
<p>But again, I think everybody can achieve</p>
<p>on a standard program,</p>
<p>can achieve the results that they want within an hour.</p>
<p>In terms of splits, you mentioned splits.</p>
<p>And so for those who aren&rsquo;t familiar with this term splits,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really which body parts are you training on which days?</p>
<p>Seems like almost everybody follows a weekly workout schedule</p>
<p>although the body of course doesn&rsquo;t care about the week.</p>
<p>Right, there&rsquo;s no reason to think that once every seven days</p>
<p>or twice every seven days makes sense physiologically,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just the body doesn&rsquo;t work that.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s the way life is structured.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen you discuss three days a week whole body workouts.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard of splits like a pushing one day,</p>
<p>pulling another day, legs another day, a day off, repeat.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s so many variations on this.</p>
<p>What are some general themes that we can throw out there?</p>
<p>And in order to avoid the huge matrix of possibilities,</p>
<p>you have some wonderful content that points to those.</p>
<p>And in our caption show notes,</p>
<p>we will link out to some of those</p>
<p>that are different ways to design splits.</p>
<p>But in terms of giving people a logic</p>
<p>of how to think about splitting up body parts,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s governing the split?</p>
<p>What are the rules and the logic that dictate a split?</p>
<p>For me, the first rule is will you stick to it, right?</p>
<p>Like if you, because there are split,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t particularly like full body splits.</p>
<p>I was actually talking to Jesse about that the other day.</p>
<p>Like I don&rsquo;t necessarily like to have to train everything.</p>
<p>Now, of course, the volumes will come down per muscle group.</p>
<p>But if you don&rsquo;t like to do that</p>
<p>and you actually don&rsquo;t look forward to your workout</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re dreading having to do everything</p>
<p>and feeling maybe too fatigued</p>
<p>by the time your workout&rsquo;s over,</p>
<p>or the fact that those generally do take a little bit longer</p>
<p>and don&rsquo;t fit into your schedule,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care how effective the split is.</p>
<p>A split not done is not effective.</p>
<p>So you need to find one that fits.</p>
<p>So maybe you go into an alternative option</p>
<p>like a push-pull legs, like you mentioned.</p>
<p>And that could be done either one cycle through the week,</p>
<p>on a Monday, Wednesday, Friday split,</p>
<p>or it could be twice in a week.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re actually training six times where you repeat it,</p>
<p>pull-push legs, pull-push legs,</p>
<p>or however you wanna do it</p>
<p>with either a day off in between the three days</p>
<p>or at the end of the six days.</p>
<p>And again, that actually impacts your schedule.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve broken that down before where it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>if you put it in between the three days,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s good because you&rsquo;re giving yourself</p>
<p>an extra rest day in between,</p>
<p>but it starts to shift that day off every week</p>
<p>as we wrap around.</p>
<p>So for those guys that were choosing</p>
<p>that seven-day schedule out of convenience in our heads,</p>
<p>it starts to mess with that off day.</p>
<p>So others like to just keep it predictably,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say on a Sunday, and train six days in a row.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s a better way</p>
<p>to maybe group similar muscle actions together,</p>
<p>which I think I definitely prefer that</p>
<p>because if I&rsquo;m going to be training, pulling movements,</p>
<p>at least there&rsquo;s a synergy between them.</p>
<p>And I feel like I&rsquo;m looking to achieve one goal that day.</p>
<p>And then, I mean, quite honestly,</p>
<p>you can go back to the bro split days,</p>
<p>and those still work effectively.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a reason why they worked in the past.</p>
<p>I think that science shows that there&rsquo;s smarter ways</p>
<p>to do them these days.</p>
<p>Like you can come back and hit a related muscle,</p>
<p>so you could do, let&rsquo;s say, biceps on one day,</p>
<p>and then come back two days later and do back,</p>
<p>realizing, again, synergy between the exercises there.</p>
<p>Your biceps are gonna get re-stimulated again.</p>
<p>So you could figure out ways to make that work.</p>
<p>But the thing that I think is effective there</p>
<p>is that tends to be one of the ones</p>
<p>that people like the most,</p>
<p>because they can go in, they get their pump,</p>
<p>they feel good, it&rsquo;s pretty solely focused</p>
<p>on one muscle group.</p>
<p>Is that the definition of a bro split?</p>
<p>One muscle group a day.</p>
<p>I see, so it&rsquo;s very much geared</p>
<p>towards strength and aesthetics,</p>
<p>really maximizing chest one day.</p>
<p>Probably more aesthetics than strength, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, you&rsquo;re just the bro name.</p>
<p>Yeah, but again, in here, I am a science guy,</p>
<p>and I can appreciate the benefits of a bro split,</p>
<p>especially, because again, to what end?</p>
<p>Whose goal are we trying to achieve here?</p>
<p>Theirs or ours?</p>
<p>I mean, if I&rsquo;m applying my standards and my goals,</p>
<p>or even athletic ideals, but they just wanna get in shape,</p>
<p>then it&rsquo;s perfectly fine to do a bro split in that instance</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re sticking to it again,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re seeing the results that you wanna see from it.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re able to really keep their focus on one muscle.</p>
<p>They get to focus on,</p>
<p>like look, a lot of times people struggle</p>
<p>with the way an exercise feels</p>
<p>until their second or third set.</p>
<p>Like they don&rsquo;t have that proprioceptive ability</p>
<p>to kinda lock in on an exercise.</p>
<p>So spending a few, not only sets in the same exercise,</p>
<p>but then doing another exercise with the same muscle group</p>
<p>helps them to dial in a little bit better</p>
<p>and get more out of their training.</p>
<p>Yeah, that raises a really interesting,</p>
<p>I think important question.</p>
<p>Early on when I started resistance training,</p>
<p>which was when I was 16 in high school,</p>
<p>I got in touch with, and I was learning from Mike Menser.</p>
<p>Me too, me too, that&rsquo;s crazy.</p>
<p>And Mike was very helpful, very, very helpful.</p>
<p>We got to be friendly.</p>
<p>So I just read his book,</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t get a chance to meet him, so I&rsquo;m jealous.</p>
<p>Back then, no internet, I paid by Western Union type thing</p>
<p>to send him some money.</p>
<p>For the back of the magazine.</p>
<p>And then he got on the phone with me,</p>
<p>and my mother at the time was like,</p>
<p>why is this grown man calling the house?</p>
<p>And he gave me a very straightforward split,</p>
<p>which was shoulders and arms.</p>
<p>One day he had me taking two days off</p>
<p>and then training legs, and then two days off,</p>
<p>and then chest and back, et cetera.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a variation of a bro split too,</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re sort of breaking them down that way,</p>
<p>chest and back, or chest and bi&rsquo;s, you know?</p>
<p>Yeah, and it worked very well for me.</p>
<p>I probably would have, because of my age, I think,</p>
<p>and because I was untrained, I think it, largely untrained,</p>
<p>I think it would have grown on many different programs,</p>
<p>but it worked very well for me.</p>
<p>I eventually just made that an every other day thing.</p>
<p>So shoulders and arms day off, legs day or two off,</p>
<p>because if you hit legs right, at least for me,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not training the next day.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;m not doing much of anything athletic</p>
<p>the next day, and chest and back, and repeat, and so on.</p>
<p>And the reason I found that helpful</p>
<p>is I almost always recovered between workouts.</p>
<p>The six day a week program of push, pull, legs,</p>
<p>push, pull, legs, to me, seems excruciating</p>
<p>from two standpoints.</p>
<p>One is, at least with my recovery abilities,</p>
<p>or lack of recovery abilities,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t imagine coming back feeling fresh.</p>
<p>And the other one is,</p>
<p>if I&rsquo;m in the gym more than four days a week,</p>
<p>I really start to fatigue it</p>
<p>about the whole psychological experience of it.</p>
<p>Whereas if I&rsquo;m in there three or four days a week,</p>
<p>in other words, if I put a day off in between each workout,</p>
<p>I really want to be there,</p>
<p>and I get in there with a lot of fire.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m also doing other things on the off days.</p>
<p>So I think that, I love that you mentioned</p>
<p>the split that you&rsquo;ll stick to,</p>
<p>and that you can bring the intensity to,</p>
<p>because I think that that&rsquo;s really important.</p>
<p>I sometimes hear about two a day training.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done two a day training twice in my lifetime,</p>
<p>both times I got sick two days later.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s correlation, not causation, you know?</p>
<p>But is there ever an instance</p>
<p>where two a day weight training makes sense</p>
<p>for the non-drug assisted,</p>
<p>typical recovery ability person?</p>
<p>I actually, I think it makes sense in some scenarios,</p>
<p>but it doesn&rsquo;t make sense practically</p>
<p>for a lot of people&rsquo;s schedules.</p>
<p>So like, if you could break down,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say you were going to do even a,</p>
<p>you know, some version of a total body session,</p>
<p>or maybe like you&rsquo;re gonna do an upper lower split, right?</p>
<p>You could do an upper workout</p>
<p>and do the anterior chain or the pushing portion of that</p>
<p>in one session, and then come back</p>
<p>and do the pulling session later on at night</p>
<p>if you had the opportunity to.</p>
<p>The thing that you benefit from there</p>
<p>is the freshness of focus.</p>
<p>Again, like something in my head is sacrificed</p>
<p>by the time you get towards the latter half</p>
<p>of whatever workout you&rsquo;re in.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same point you made before.</p>
<p>Like when you start to approach that 50 minutes,</p>
<p>an hour mark, you are either losing focus,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re losing energy, you&rsquo;re losing contractile ability,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re losing something.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re relegating whatever it is,</p>
<p>the pulling portion of that to the end of that workout,</p>
<p>something suffers.</p>
<p>So that, okay, and that, if they realize that&rsquo;s happening,</p>
<p>then maybe you switch them up</p>
<p>the next time you do the workout</p>
<p>where the pulling portion of the upper workout goes first,</p>
<p>and then the pushing goes later.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re at least not just continuing that cycle.</p>
<p>But at the same time,</p>
<p>if you were able to kind of split them up,</p>
<p>you get a chance to kind of take a break,</p>
<p>you could have that freshness of focus again,</p>
<p>and you could actually get a better effort in.</p>
<p>Because again, I think effort drives the results.</p>
<p>So if the effort is not compromised,</p>
<p>then you should be able to do that.</p>
<p>But systemically, is that a problem?</p>
<p>And I think that it is a problem for a lot of people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just hard to rev the engine up</p>
<p>a lot of times in the day.</p>
<p>You warm that thing up once,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like that car in the winter,</p>
<p>you get it going once, you&rsquo;re lucky.</p>
<p>Okay, now you gotta drive it the rest of the day.</p>
<p>But you put it in the garage</p>
<p>and try to start it the next day, it&rsquo;s a problem.</p>
<p>So young people can get away with a lot more</p>
<p>than older people could.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never had a strong recovery quotient,</p>
<p>but if I stick to this one day off in between,</p>
<p>every once in a while, two days in a row of training,</p>
<p>maybe because I have to travel</p>
<p>and I wanna make sure I get all the workouts in</p>
<p>kind of thing, I seem to be okay.</p>
<p>I like your example of warming up the car,</p>
<p>spoken like a true East Coaster.</p>
<p>Those of us from the West Coast took a moment there,</p>
<p>but folks from the East Coast and the Midwest get it,</p>
<p>and certainly from Europe.</p>
<p>In terms of the mixing up of cardiovascular training</p>
<p>and resistance training, same day, different day,</p>
<p>which one should come first, which one should come second?</p>
<p>If one&rsquo;s main goals, again,</p>
<p>everyone listening has different goals,</p>
<p>are most people would like to either maintain</p>
<p>or gain some muscle.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know many people that wanna lose muscle.</p>
<p>Maintain or gain some muscle,</p>
<p>usually in specific locations on their body.</p>
<p>Most people would like to be a bit leaner or a lot leaner.</p>
<p>There are a few people out there</p>
<p>that are either naturally lean</p>
<p>or actually just wanna gain weight,</p>
<p>but assuming that people wanna get leaner,</p>
<p>put on some muscle or maintain muscle,</p>
<p>and wanna have a healthy heart and a healthy brain,</p>
<p>which basically requires a healthy cardiovascular system,</p>
<p>how would you incorporate cardiovascular work</p>
<p>into the overall weekly regimen?</p>
<p>So again, I think that the bare minimum</p>
<p>is probably twice a week in terms of cardiovascular</p>
<p>if you wanna have some semblance</p>
<p>of cardiovascular conditioning.</p>
<p>But I think most people who actually need it more</p>
<p>or wanna pursue it more than that</p>
<p>are gonna need more time to do that.</p>
<p>So at some point, it can&rsquo;t just be relegated to a day off</p>
<p>or a day off from the weight training workouts.</p>
<p>So at some point, it has to occur on the same day.</p>
<p>And in that case, I just like to put it,</p>
<p>if that is not your primary goal,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re looking more for just the overall picture,</p>
<p>the aesthetics you mentioned,</p>
<p>putting muscle on in certain areas,</p>
<p>then I would put it at the end of the workout</p>
<p>because you don&rsquo;t wanna in any way</p>
<p>compromise the weight training workout.</p>
<p>And as we&rsquo;ve sort of referenced a couple of times already,</p>
<p>the intensity of those workouts is important.</p>
<p>And we know there&rsquo;s a strength component to those workouts</p>
<p>also that is going to be a helpful stimulus for growth.</p>
<p>So the conditioning, the cardio,</p>
<p>that stuff done prior to any strength training workout</p>
<p>is likely going to impair your ability</p>
<p>to perform at your best.</p>
<p>So unless it&rsquo;s just done for a quick little warmup</p>
<p>in the beginning, but then it&rsquo;s not sustained long enough</p>
<p>really to be of benefit for cardiovascular conditioning.</p>
<p>So I just like to put that at the end,</p>
<p>realizing that even if my effort level is lower,</p>
<p>my output is lower,</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s still placing a demand on my cardiac output</p>
<p>to get that conditioning effect,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m fatigued,</p>
<p>it still has a demand on my cardiac output.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s still achieving its goal,</p>
<p>but it didn&rsquo;t interfere with my main goal</p>
<p>of being able to increase my performance in the gym.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>And in terms of the form of cardiovascular training,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen you do a number of,</p>
<p>I have to say, very impressive</p>
<p>high intensity interval type work.</p>
<p>So burpee type work or pushups</p>
<p>with crunches mixed into them.</p>
<p>Anyway, people can see your videos to,</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t describe those in the best way,</p>
<p>but rather than on the treadmill</p>
<p>or out jogging for 30, 45 minutes,</p>
<p>is that because you prefer higher intensity,</p>
<p>higher heart rate type training,</p>
<p>or is it because you live in cold Connecticut</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t want to be out jogging on the roads</p>
<p>in the middle of winter?</p>
<p>I think all of the above.</p>
<p>I mean, those are factors from a personal level,</p>
<p>but I think that if you are,</p>
<p>if we could blend function across these realms</p>
<p>and not have such a delineation between</p>
<p>this is my weight training and this is my conditioning,</p>
<p>but figure out a way to blend them together,</p>
<p>I always think that you&rsquo;ve got a better opportunity</p>
<p>to get that more well-rounded result.</p>
<p>And I like to kind of mix up</p>
<p>that straight conditioning work.</p>
<p>And also some of the footwork drills,</p>
<p>like we have some high expectations</p>
<p>for guys that come into our programs</p>
<p>like to just do some footwork drills.</p>
<p>Like ladders.</p>
<p>Like ladders or line drills or something.</p>
<p>And you know what happens?</p>
<p>People become intrigued and interested.</p>
<p>Like I never, I haven&rsquo;t tried this since high school,</p>
<p>you know?</p>
<p>And they become interested in just the challenge of it.</p>
<p>And then as we become almost distracted by the challenge,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re now like finding ourselves conditioning, you know?</p>
<p>And I always think that&rsquo;s an important part</p>
<p>that sometimes you got to draw people in</p>
<p>to show them what they might be interested in.</p>
<p>And from the output or the effect of it,</p>
<p>I just think that when you&rsquo;re able to blend some of some,</p>
<p>you know, still maintain some of that strength training</p>
<p>into the exercise.</p>
<p>So as you mentioned,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say I&rsquo;m doing some kind of a pushup or a burpee.</p>
<p>I mean, there is an anaerobic component to that</p>
<p>that is going to be helpful,</p>
<p>rather than just walking or just jogging.</p>
<p>Not to say that that isn&rsquo;t an effective means</p>
<p>for strict cardiac conditioning.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of the ways that we&rsquo;ve had for centuries,</p>
<p>you know, to do it.</p>
<p>But I just think that if we can blend it,</p>
<p>then it becomes maybe a little bit more interesting</p>
<p>and you get some of those crossover benefits</p>
<p>and it doesn&rsquo;t become so segmented</p>
<p>in terms of what we&rsquo;re trying to do.</p>
<p>I love the idea of bringing some mental challenge</p>
<p>and some desire to improve a skill while conditioning.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not something that I&rsquo;ve thought of before</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s simply because I&rsquo;ve overlooked it,</p>
<p>but it makes sense because my sister,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s reasonably fit,</p>
<p>although I&rsquo;m always trying to get her to do a bit more,</p>
<p>she always asks me, you know, what should I take?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m a believer in supplements for certain people</p>
<p>in certain instances, but I keep telling her, you know,</p>
<p>behaviors are going to,</p>
<p>and nutrition are going to have</p>
<p>the greatest outsized positive effect.</p>
<p>And she loves things like dance classes and things</p>
<p>or kickboxing, these kinds of things.</p>
<p>So it makes sense that if you can hook somebody</p>
<p>on the conditioning aspect or the skill aspect</p>
<p>and kind of trick them into doing more cardio,</p>
<p>so to speak, that&rsquo;s terrific.</p>
<p>Also, the neuroscientist in me just has to say, forgive me,</p>
<p>that anytime you&rsquo;re engaging the two sets of motor neurons,</p>
<p>the ones in your brain, the upper motor neurons</p>
<p>and the ones in your spinal cord,</p>
<p>anytime you&rsquo;re engaging those upper motor neurons,</p>
<p>which are for deliberate, well-controlled action,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing a great thing for your brain</p>
<p>in terms of brain longevity.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m, now I need to incorporate</p>
<p>some actual skills into my training.</p>
<p>Going back to weight training a bit,</p>
<p>one of the most important things I learned from you,</p>
<p>so over the years,</p>
<p>was that when training to increase muscle size,</p>
<p>to really think not so much about moving weights,</p>
<p>but more about challenging muscles.</p>
<p>I also heard this from my friend, Ben Pakulski,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s very well accomplished.</p>
<p>He was a bodybuilder,</p>
<p>now he&rsquo;s into other aspects of fitness, teaches fitness,</p>
<p>but don&rsquo;t move weights, challenge muscles,</p>
<p>unless you&rsquo;re trying to power lift</p>
<p>or something of that sort, which I&rsquo;m not.</p>
<p>Immensely helpful.</p>
<p>But the other thing that I learned from you</p>
<p>that I combined with that was this idea</p>
<p>that certain muscles will grow better</p>
<p>and get stronger much more easily.</p>
<p>Maybe even will recover better</p>
<p>because of our ability to contract them really hard.</p>
<p>And this, what I call the Cavalier Test,</p>
<p>which is, at least if I could paraphrase the,</p>
<p>so for instance, if I can,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s always the bicep, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s use the calf or the bicep.</p>
<p>If you can flex your bicep to the point</p>
<p>where it hurts a little bit,</p>
<p>like it almost feels like a cramp or a cramp,</p>
<p>or you can flex your calf to the point</p>
<p>where it really cramps up a little bit,</p>
<p>almost feels like it&rsquo;s nodding up.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a pretty good indication</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re going to be able to stimulate that muscle</p>
<p>well under load if you&rsquo;re doing the movement properly.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the feeling to actually aim for each repetition,</p>
<p>maybe even throughout the repetition.</p>
<p>For me, this completely transformed my results.</p>
<p>And this was, I think maybe five, six years ago</p>
<p>that I first heard this from you.</p>
<p>Body parts that for me lagged behind</p>
<p>that I thought maybe genetically</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t gonna work for me,</p>
<p>immediately just started growing, right?</p>
<p>And I was getting stronger and stronger.</p>
<p>I thought this is really something,</p>
<p>so much so that I&rsquo;ve dedicated a portion of my research</p>
<p>along in collaboration with another group</p>
<p>to try and understand what&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>in these upper motor neurons in the brain</p>
<p>that can engage the muscles even more.</p>
<p>And that it&rsquo;s not just about progressive overload</p>
<p>or putting a pump into the muscle,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s really this mind-muscle connection</p>
<p>is a real thing when it comes to predicting results</p>
<p>and that you can get better at it.</p>
<p>So forgive me for paraphrasing</p>
<p>your incredible content around this.</p>
<p>It made a tremendous difference for me</p>
<p>and a number of other people that I&rsquo;ve passed that along to.</p>
<p>But what can you, first of all, how did you arrive at that?</p>
<p>Because we hear about the mind-muscle connection,</p>
<p>but I really heard it first from you.</p>
<p>How did you arrive at this kind of cramp test,</p>
<p>the cavalier test, as I&rsquo;ll call it?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always weird when people name things</p>
<p>after themselves in science,</p>
<p>but other scientists can name things.</p>
<p>So there is now officially the cavalier test</p>
<p>is whether or not you can cramp the muscle</p>
<p>in the absence of load, just flexing it</p>
<p>to the point where it hurts a little bit.</p>
<p>That would be a good indication</p>
<p>that you could grow that muscle well.</p>
<p>So how did you come up with this?</p>
<p>I mean, it just, honestly,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s something that made sense to me</p>
<p>because during my workouts,</p>
<p>even as a young kid just starting out,</p>
<p>I always wanted to know what is it working?</p>
<p>A lot of people ask that question</p>
<p>more so than you think.</p>
<p>What is this supposed to work?</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ve ever noticed,</p>
<p>but when people ask that question</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re being trained by a trainer</p>
<p>and the trainer&rsquo;s saying,</p>
<p>well, just do this, do this exercise,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll show you how to do it.</p>
<p>But then they&rsquo;ll say, but what is it supposed to work?</p>
<p>Where am I supposed to feel this?</p>
<p>People, they just inherently ask that question.</p>
<p>A lot of people will.</p>
<p>I was one of those that did that</p>
<p>and I asked that question,</p>
<p>not because I knew what I was doing,</p>
<p>but just because I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I wanted to know what was supposed to be doing the work.</p>
<p>Once you do that and you start to seek that out</p>
<p>and say, okay, well, if the bicep</p>
<p>is what&rsquo;s supposed to be doing the work,</p>
<p>then I wanna make sure the bicep&rsquo;s doing the work.</p>
<p>So then I would just sort of really tweak the movement</p>
<p>to make it do more work or feel more uncomfortable</p>
<p>or get a stronger contraction</p>
<p>knowing if that&rsquo;s supposed to do the job.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t until PT school that I&rsquo;m learning,</p>
<p>oh, well, flexion of the elbow is the brachialis</p>
<p>and the bicep and the bicep&rsquo;s responsible for supination.</p>
<p>I learned other components of it,</p>
<p>but all I wanted to know was to bring my arm up in a curl,</p>
<p>what is supposed to do the job?</p>
<p>So I would seek out ways to make that happen better.</p>
<p>And when I was able to do that,</p>
<p>I could feel the stronger contraction.</p>
<p>And I just, I don&rsquo;t know what, I just, I was no visionary.</p>
<p>I just felt like I knew that that was gonna be better for me</p>
<p>if the muscle I was trying to grow</p>
<p>was being stressed more effectively.</p>
<p>So when I was attempting to do this</p>
<p>across different exercises,</p>
<p>I would notice that what I could do potentially</p>
<p>on a curl where my arm is up,</p>
<p>where you asked me to flex my bicep, that position,</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t do if I was doing a concentration curl</p>
<p>or I couldn&rsquo;t carry over to a cable curl.</p>
<p>And that shouldn&rsquo;t really change, right?</p>
<p>Because the function is still largely the same.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s still elbow flexion.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s still supination.</p>
<p>Why am I not able to do it there?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where it sort of clued into me</p>
<p>that your mind-muscle connection</p>
<p>on not just your mind with one muscle,</p>
<p>but on every exercise matters.</p>
<p>And it varies from exercise to exercise.</p>
<p>And even if you don&rsquo;t gain muscle size from doing that,</p>
<p>although I think it&rsquo;s very hard not to,</p>
<p>especially if you&rsquo;re not used to doing that,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a term I like to call muscularity,</p>
<p>which is a difference, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the level of sort of resting tone in the muscle.</p>
<p>That improves dramatically.</p>
<p>If you can learn how to just start</p>
<p>to engage that muscle better,</p>
<p>the muscularity, the resting tone of that muscle is harder.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more at attention.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just more alive, you know?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s all driven from being able</p>
<p>to connect better neurologically</p>
<p>with the muscle that you&rsquo;re trying to train.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked about a lot.</p>
<p>Inefficiency is really what you&rsquo;re trying to seek</p>
<p>in movements when you&rsquo;re trying to create hypertrophy.</p>
<p>When strength is your goal,</p>
<p>efficiency of the movement is what you&rsquo;re looking for.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re looking to have muscles tie together</p>
<p>and work well efficiently,</p>
<p>the chest, the shoulders, the triceps,</p>
<p>to get a bar off of your chest during a bench press.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not looking to make it a very inefficient,</p>
<p>you know, leverages for your chest</p>
<p>to try to grow your chest in a bench press.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re trying to let the whole package come together</p>
<p>for a greater output.</p>
<p>But when you&rsquo;re trying to go and create muscle hypertrophy,</p>
<p>or even this muscularity that I talk about,</p>
<p>you need to seek ways to make it feel more uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t feel the discomfort,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re doing something wrong.</p>
<p>And I struggle to this day on certain muscle groups</p>
<p>to still do that, even knowing what I&rsquo;m trying to work</p>
<p>and knowing what the goal of everything I&rsquo;m preaching here.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very difficult for some muscles</p>
<p>and for certain people to do this on certain muscles.</p>
<p>But as you mentioned, practice does help.</p>
<p>And the more you become, you know,</p>
<p>consistent and deliberate with what you&rsquo;re trying to do,</p>
<p>the more of a result you actually get.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a couple of really important points</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to delve into further.</p>
<p>First of all, my hunch was always that the muscle groups</p>
<p>that grew most easily and that I could contract hardest</p>
<p>without any, the first time I did the Cavalier test,</p>
<p>got 10 out of 10, if we give it a 10 out of 10 scale.</p>
<p>You know, it could just like cinch, isolate those muscles,</p>
<p>cinch them, grow them easily.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s certain body parts,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to say which ones</p>
<p>because it doesn&rsquo;t really matter,</p>
<p>that I always felt like if I just did pushups,</p>
<p>they would grow and these muscles are far away</p>
<p>from any of the muscles</p>
<p>that are supposed to be involved in pushups.</p>
<p>Even though I like to think I&rsquo;m doing pushups correctly.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll tell me if I&rsquo;m not.</p>
<p>But some of that I think is genetic</p>
<p>and some of that has to do with the sports</p>
<p>that I played when I was younger.</p>
<p>So I swam, I played soccer, I skateboarded.</p>
<p>And then later I boxed.</p>
<p>And so the muscles involved in those sports</p>
<p>were always very easy to engage later</p>
<p>when I went into the gym.</p>
<p>So I guess perhaps a call to parents,</p>
<p>having kids do a lot of dynamic activity</p>
<p>seems like it might be a good idea.</p>
<p>The other thing is this issue of muscularity.</p>
<p>I am so glad you brought that up.</p>
<p>There are, I have to imagine,</p>
<p>a large number of listeners who don&rsquo;t want to get bigger.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t want to take up a larger clothing size.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t want to take up more space.</p>
<p>In fact, some of them would like to take up less space,</p>
<p>but they want that quality that you&rsquo;re describing,</p>
<p>which is that oftentimes you hear it more in the,</p>
<p>here I&rsquo;m stereotyping a bit,</p>
<p>but with kindness, you hear from women</p>
<p>who are in weight training,</p>
<p>they say, I don&rsquo;t want to get big.</p>
<p>Often, sometimes they do,</p>
<p>but most women that I&rsquo;ve helped weight train</p>
<p>or talked to about weight training say,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to get bigger, I want to get tone.</p>
<p>And I think what they&rsquo;re referring to</p>
<p>is this quality of muscularity,</p>
<p>this idea that at resting or at close to rest</p>
<p>or anytime someone reaches out and grabs a glass,</p>
<p>that the muscles almost look like</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re kind of twitching underneath the skin,</p>
<p>and yet it&rsquo;s not saran wrap skin, anatomy chart type skin.</p>
<p>So this thing of muscularity or resting tone</p>
<p>has a physiological basis.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s how readily the nerves</p>
<p>are communicating with the muscles.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re saying that by learning</p>
<p>to engage the muscles more actively,</p>
<p>the resting tone or muscularity can improve.</p>
<p>Have you seen that both in men and women?</p>
<p>Yeah, oh yeah.</p>
<p>And do you think this is something</p>
<p>that takes upkeep, maintenance,</p>
<p>or that once you develop that in a muscle,</p>
<p>you can just kind of let it coast?</p>
<p>So I think like everything, it requires upkeep,</p>
<p>use it or lose it, I do believe firmly.</p>
<p>But I think that it&rsquo;s the development of the connection</p>
<p>is going to be harder than the maintenance of the connection</p>
<p>and as I said, I still struggle to this day myself</p>
<p>with unnamed muscle groups also.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s just certain areas that are harder</p>
<p>for your brain for whatever reason</p>
<p>to just develop that connection at that type of level</p>
<p>to create that extra strong contraction.</p>
<p>But I think that with proper dedication and focus,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll go right out and say,</p>
<p>calves is one of the areas that I don&rsquo;t necessarily</p>
<p>have a great connection with.</p>
<p>And I also obviously must not care so much</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t put in the time and effort</p>
<p>to create that connection as I could.</p>
<p>So I think what might happen is,</p>
<p>yeah, there could be a struggle there,</p>
<p>but then with struggle comes disinterest.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like, well, screw it, I&rsquo;m a calf not,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not gonna do anything about it.</p>
<p>So I think if you put the required effort in</p>
<p>and the time and repetitions that you will develop that</p>
<p>and once you do develop it,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna stick around a lot longer than it would</p>
<p>had you not invested any time into it at all,</p>
<p>not requiring as much of that.</p>
<p>But I mean, I don&rsquo;t know, you mentioned now when you train,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, this is just part of how you train now.</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;re going hard,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re trying to really forcefully contract.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not just moving the weight,</p>
<p>I say from point A to point B,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re like trying to contract the weight</p>
<p>through that range.</p>
<p>That is a mindset that I try to put into</p>
<p>what everything I&rsquo;m doing,</p>
<p>unless of course I&rsquo;m focused on a strength exercise</p>
<p>where I&rsquo;m just trying to lift a greater amount</p>
<p>and use all the muscles together.</p>
<p>But when the goal is inefficiency for hypertrophy,</p>
<p>I am really trying to create that contraction</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just part of my training.</p>
<p>So I guess that for consistency sake,</p>
<p>as long as I&rsquo;m training, it&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>If I get away from training, then it&rsquo;s not happening at all.</p>
<p>But even there, I probably, another embarrassing admission,</p>
<p>I probably will mindfully do it throughout the day,</p>
<p>even with no weight in my hand, in certain muscle groups,</p>
<p>whether it be my abs or my arm or my shoulders or something,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m doing something just to sort of engage the muscles.</p>
<p>And I do think that some of that sort of inane practice</p>
<p>actually helps by the time you go back into the gym.</p>
<p>You just kind of keep that connection going.</p>
<p>Well, it certainly obeys all the rules of neuroplasticity.</p>
<p>The fire together, wire together mantra,</p>
<p>which is the words of my colleague, Carla Schatz,</p>
<p>hold true for all aspects of neural function,</p>
<p>including nerve to muscle.</p>
<p>So these flexing throughout the day</p>
<p>or the deliberate isolation of contracting a muscle</p>
<p>throughout the day is without question</p>
<p>engaging neuroplasticity.</p>
<p>And if you were to do fewer of those repetitions,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna get less engagement</p>
<p>of the nerve to muscle connection.</p>
<p>I can say this with a smile and with confidence</p>
<p>because one of the first things</p>
<p>all neuroscience students learn</p>
<p>is about the neuromuscular junction</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a really simple example</p>
<p>of where the more times the nerve fires</p>
<p>and gets the muscle to contract,</p>
<p>the stronger that connection gets.</p>
<p>Receptors are brought there, et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a whole bunch of mechanisms</p>
<p>for the topic of another podcast.</p>
<p>But basically that practice throughout the day</p>
<p>is makes total sense and works.</p>
<p>Yeah, and there&rsquo;s no, believe me,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no science behind that</p>
<p>in terms of the application of it.</p>
<p>You do it when you catch yourself doing it</p>
<p>from time to time.</p>
<p>But it is definitely something that&rsquo;s easily done</p>
<p>discreetly and you wind up doing it.</p>
<p>I think in a recent video when I did talk about</p>
<p>growing your arms by just improving the connection,</p>
<p>not that that connection itself is applying any load</p>
<p>or resistance that&rsquo;s significant</p>
<p>to create overload for growth,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s the development of that connection</p>
<p>that I then take back with me into the gym</p>
<p>at a more effective level</p>
<p>that takes every exercise I do there</p>
<p>and makes it more effective.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like sharpening the blade, so to speak.</p>
<p>Yeah, certainly obeys the laws</p>
<p>of nerve to muscle physiology.</p>
<p>Wanted to just touch on a couple of things.</p>
<p>If the goal is to challenge muscles</p>
<p>and one is dividing their body into, let&rsquo;s say,</p>
<p>three or four day a week split or so,</p>
<p>or maybe up to six,</p>
<p>how do you know when a muscle</p>
<p>is ready to be challenged again?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard, okay, every 48 hours</p>
<p>is protein synthesis increases,</p>
<p>and then we&rsquo;ll get into this, and then it drops off.</p>
<p>But frankly, if I train my legs hard,</p>
<p>I can get stronger from workout to workout,</p>
<p>or at least better in some way,</p>
<p>workout to workout, leg workout to leg workout,</p>
<p>training them once every five to eight days.</p>
<p>If I train them more often, I get worse.</p>
<p>So whatever that 48-hour to 72-hour thing is,</p>
<p>somehow my legs don&rsquo;t obey that,</p>
<p>or maybe something else is wrong with me,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m sure there are many things else wrong with me,</p>
<p>but how do you assess recovery at the local level,</p>
<p>meaning at the level of the muscles?</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ll talk about soreness and getting better,</p>
<p>stronger, more repetitions, et cetera,</p>
<p>and then at the systemic level,</p>
<p>the level of the nervous system.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d love for you to tell us about the tool</p>
<p>that, again, I learned from you,</p>
<p>which is actually using a physical scale,</p>
<p>because it turns out,</p>
<p>this is that will let you tell what the tool is,</p>
<p>but that tool is also actively being used</p>
<p>for assessing cognitive decline</p>
<p>and cognitive maintenance and cognitive function</p>
<p>in people with Alzheimer&rsquo;s and dementia.</p>
<p>Makes total sense, makes total sense.</p>
<p>All right, so regarding the first part of the question,</p>
<p>like how would you kind of dictate</p>
<p>when a muscle&rsquo;s recovered?</p>
<p>So I do think that what you&rsquo;re experiencing</p>
<p>is totally real,</p>
<p>that different muscles recover at different rates.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve always been so fascinated by this concept.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked about internally with my team,</p>
<p>but I feel like what we really need,</p>
<p>the holy grail to training is going to be</p>
<p>when we&rsquo;re able to crack the code on an individual basis</p>
<p>when a muscle is recovered,</p>
<p>and that is going to dictate its training schedule.</p>
<p>And the fact that you might have a bicep</p>
<p>that could be trained via a pulling workout,</p>
<p>a regular bicep-dedicated workout,</p>
<p>forget the split at the moment,</p>
<p>you might have a bicep that&rsquo;s able to be trained</p>
<p>that can be trained again the next day,</p>
<p>and then the next day,</p>
<p>and then maybe you need a day off after that.</p>
<p>But in that, that can vary from person to person for sure,</p>
<p>and it can vary from muscle to muscle in that person</p>
<p>over the course of time, as you mentioned,</p>
<p>because the systemic recovery</p>
<p>is going to impact all those muscles anyway.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re systemically recovering,</p>
<p>every muscle itself is going to have a recovery rate.</p>
<p>And I think what&rsquo;s fascinating is that</p>
<p>when you talked about before,</p>
<p>we like to train this week,</p>
<p>or we have like the way our mind looks at training,</p>
<p>well, if that was the case with the biceps,</p>
<p>that bicep is a slave to the rest of your training split,</p>
<p>you know, where it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>well, why does it have to be also at the end</p>
<p>of every eighth day or whatever</p>
<p>when it might respond better</p>
<p>to something much more frequently?</p>
<p>And your legs are also being thrown into that mix.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a Mike Mencer concept where he&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>train it one set and be done for 14 days.</p>
<p>I mean, you know, there&rsquo;s such variability</p>
<p>between muscle groups and you&rsquo;re linking them all together.</p>
<p>I think that coming back and using muscle soreness</p>
<p>as a guideline for that is one of the only tools we have</p>
<p>in terms of the local level.</p>
<p>You know, we don&rsquo;t really have, you know,</p>
<p>being able to measure, let&rsquo;s say,</p>
<p>CPK levels inside of a muscle would be amazing,</p>
<p>at a local level to see how recovered that muscle is,</p>
<p>but that becomes fairly invasive,</p>
<p>at least to my knowledge, it becomes fairly invasive.</p>
<p>So what are our tools?</p>
<p>I mean, I think that at the basic level,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the one that most people can relate to</p>
<p>and easily identify and then use that as a guideline.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re training when you&rsquo;re really sore,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s probably not a great idea.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s probably a good indication</p>
<p>that that muscle is not recovered,</p>
<p>but at least hearing what you and I are saying here</p>
<p>might be a comfort to the person to say,</p>
<p>yeah, it is possible that it&rsquo;s not recovered,</p>
<p>just because 48 hours is the recommendation</p>
<p>and just because research points to muscle protein synthesis</p>
<p>needing a restimulation, well, maybe not,</p>
<p>maybe you&rsquo;re not necessarily there yet,</p>
<p>for that muscle, you&rsquo;re not there yet.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s all really interesting stuff,</p>
<p>but as far as the systemic recovery,</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a lot of ways,</p>
<p>people talk about resting heart rate</p>
<p>measured in the morning,</p>
<p>all different kinds of core temperature</p>
<p>and things like that that might become altered</p>
<p>in a state of non-recovery,</p>
<p>but grip strength is very, very much tied</p>
<p>to performance and recovery.</p>
<p>And when I was at the Mets,</p>
<p>we used to actually take grip strength measurements</p>
<p>as a baseline in spring training all the time.</p>
<p>Now, obviously, as a baseball player,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gripping a bat, you&rsquo;re a pitcher,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gripping a ball,</p>
<p>having good grip strength is important.</p>
<p>So if we&rsquo;ve noticed somebody had a very weak grip,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just a good focal point</p>
<p>of a specialized training component for the program.</p>
<p>Would you do this every day with those guys?</p>
<p>No, we would do, in spring training,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;d do sort of a baseline entry-level measurement,</p>
<p>and then we would measure it throughout the season,</p>
<p>maybe once every two weeks or three weeks.</p>
<p>And the idea there was to manage their recovery,</p>
<p>measure their recovery.</p>
<p>But I just gave it away.</p>
<p>To determine overall recovery,</p>
<p>your grip strength is pretty highly correlated.</p>
<p>So we have found that with one of those scales,</p>
<p>those old-fashioned bathroom scales</p>
<p>at Bed Bath &amp; Beyond or wherever you can get,</p>
<p>which, by the way, almost impossible.</p>
<p>I believe Jesse and I were searching for the last scale</p>
<p>to put in that video, and we almost couldn&rsquo;t find one,</p>
<p>because everything is digital and everything.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking at the old-fashioned dial controls.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like old Macintosh computers.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a huge market for them, and old phones.</p>
<p>Kids, keep your phones now.</p>
<p>In 30 years, the lame phone now</p>
<p>will be worth a lot of money.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll be worth a lot.</p>
<p>So I wound up finding one,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a great tool for just squeezing</p>
<p>the scale with your hands</p>
<p>and seeing what type of output you could get.</p>
<p>And I think we all can relate to this</p>
<p>when you just visualize.</p>
<p>Imagine the last time you were sick,</p>
<p>or just try this the next time you wake up in the morning.</p>
<p>When you first wake up in the morning,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re still groggy.</p>
<p>Try to squeeze your hand.</p>
<p>Try to make a fist as hard as you can.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna sit there angry at your fist</p>
<p>because it won&rsquo;t contract as hard as you know it can.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have the ability to just create the output,</p>
<p>and that is because in that state,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re still sleepy.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re still fatigued.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not even awake at the whole level at this point.</p>
<p>Well, that is still an actual phenomenon</p>
<p>that happens that a lack of recovery</p>
<p>or a lack of wakefulness or whatever you wanna say</p>
<p>is gonna lead to a decreased output there.</p>
<p>So when you start to measure that on a daily basis,</p>
<p>you can get a pretty good sense of where you&rsquo;re at.</p>
<p>And I think when people start to see a drop-off</p>
<p>of 10% or so or even greater of their grip output,</p>
<p>you really should skip the gym that day</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s much you&rsquo;re gonna do there</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to be that beneficial,</p>
<p>even if it is the day to train legs or whatever day it is.</p>
<p>I love this tool.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s simple.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s low-cost if you can find such a scale.</p>
<p>I guess you could also find one of those grippers that,</p>
<p>and you can do this in a very non-quantitative way,</p>
<p>but better would be a scale</p>
<p>where you could actually measure</p>
<p>how hard you can squeeze this thing at a given time of day.</p>
<p>It draws to mind just a little neuroscience factoid.</p>
<p>In the world of circadian neurobiology,</p>
<p>one of the consistent findings</p>
<p>is that in the middle of your nighttime,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll wake people up and they&rsquo;ll say, do this test.</p>
<p>In the laboratory, they use a different apparatus,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s essentially the same thing.</p>
<p>And in the middle of the night,</p>
<p>grip strength is very, very low.</p>
<p>And mid-morning, grip strength is high.</p>
<p>And as the body temperature goes up into the afternoon,</p>
<p>grip strength goes higher and higher and higher,</p>
<p>and then it drops off.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a circadian rhythm in grip temperature.</p>
<p>So you probably wanna do this</p>
<p>at more or less the same time each day if you&rsquo;re gonna use it</p>
<p>but I think it&rsquo;s brilliant in its simplicity</p>
<p>and its directness to these upper motor neurons</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s really what it&rsquo;s assessing.</p>
<p>Your ability, again, it&rsquo;s about the ability</p>
<p>to contract the muscles hard.</p>
<p>If you can&rsquo;t do that,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not gonna get an effective workout.</p>
<p>Yeah, and they also, I mean,</p>
<p>there certainly are more sophisticated tools too as a PT.</p>
<p>We have hand-grip dynamometers</p>
<p>and we can measure one side at a time too.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m getting a little bit blinded by the fact</p>
<p>that both hands are squeezing into that scale</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t get really a left-right comparison.</p>
<p>But even at that level,</p>
<p>that could give you a little bit more detail</p>
<p>but that comes with a cost.</p>
<p>Those are pretty expensive devices.</p>
<p>But if it&rsquo;s, listen, if you were an athlete,</p>
<p>the 200, 300 bucks it costs to have one of those</p>
<p>would be well worth the added investment.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m sure some of our listeners will want one too</p>
<p>because there are a lot of tech geeks out there.</p>
<p>Not tech industry geeks but people who like tech gear.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s it called again?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a hand-grip dynamometer.</p>
<p>Hand-grip dynamometer.</p>
<p>Said by Jeff with the great East Coast accident</p>
<p>and by me in a terrible botched West Coast version.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll put that in the show notes also.</p>
<p>No, I think recovery is key.</p>
<p>We always hear about sleep.</p>
<p>You grow when you sleep.</p>
<p>And incidentally, your brain,</p>
<p>you stimulate learning when you&rsquo;re awake obviously</p>
<p>but the reordering of neural connections happens in sleep.</p>
<p>This is why sleep is the way to get smarter</p>
<p>provided you&rsquo;re also doing the learning part.</p>
<p>This leaves a way to get stronger</p>
<p>provided you&rsquo;re also doing the training part.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve had some really,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve put out interesting content over the years</p>
<p>in terms of even sleep position.</p>
<p>One of the major changes that I made to my sleep behavior</p>
<p>is to not have the sheets tucked in at the end of the bed.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll tell you,</p>
<p>this had a profound impact on several things.</p>
<p>First of all, my feet have always been</p>
<p>the bane of my existence.</p>
<p>Broke them a bunch skateboarding.</p>
<p>And I noticed when I&rsquo;d run, I&rsquo;d get shin splints.</p>
<p>And then I started to notice that my feet</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re the PT, they were kind of floppy.</p>
<p>And as if I was pointing my toes slightly all the time</p>
<p>at rest, if I was.</p>
<p>And I realized that based on listening to you previously</p>
<p>that my sheets were wrapped tight, not hotel tight.</p>
<p>Right, right.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what they&rsquo;re thinking in the hotels.</p>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t get your feet in.</p>
<p>And I started releasing the sheets at the end of the bed.</p>
<p>And I also started doing some tibialis work,</p>
<p>front of shins work essentially.</p>
<p>Changed everything.</p>
<p>My back pain from running, my shin splints disappeared,</p>
<p>my posture improved.</p>
<p>Although my audience will tell me</p>
<p>that it still needs improvement.</p>
<p>There are always five or 10 people that want.</p>
<p>Sit up straight.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve actually had chairs sent to our mailing address.</p>
<p>Very nice chairs.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m trying there.</p>
<p>But this is fascinating, right?</p>
<p>The position that one sleeps in.</p>
<p>I fortunately have never had any shoulder issues,</p>
<p>knock on wood.</p>
<p>But maybe you could just talk to us a little bit</p>
<p>about sleep and sleep position</p>
<p>for sake of waking position and movement.</p>
<p>Because this I think is a very unique</p>
<p>and very powerful way to think about sleep.</p>
<p>This podcast has done a lot of episodes</p>
<p>about keeping the room cool,</p>
<p>getting sunlight in your eyes, et cetera.</p>
<p>How to get into sleep.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;ve talked about physically</p>
<p>what positions might be better to sleep in.</p>
<p>So please, please enrich us.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, well first of all,</p>
<p>some people&rsquo;s opinions of that type of content</p>
<p>is that you sleep in the position that&rsquo;s most comfortable</p>
<p>so you ensure that you&rsquo;re sleeping.</p>
<p>I understand that.</p>
<p>We all want to sleep.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the goal when we put our head on the pillow</p>
<p>is to actually fall asleep and wake up in the morning</p>
<p>and not know what the hell happened</p>
<p>unless you had a dream.</p>
<p>But beyond that,</p>
<p>there are certainly physical components to sleep</p>
<p>that that is why a lot of times people wake up</p>
<p>and say like that you can incur</p>
<p>pretty serious injuries in sleep.</p>
<p>People will wake up and have like a shoulder</p>
<p>that did not bother them at all</p>
<p>be humming the next day or even for weeks after</p>
<p>because of the one sleep position they put themselves in</p>
<p>in a prolonged way.</p>
<p>And they happen to have a deep sleep</p>
<p>even through the discomfort</p>
<p>that can do actually some damage.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s understandable that the body can incur</p>
<p>some strain and stress if you&rsquo;re sleeping in the wrong way.</p>
<p>One of the things I say right off the bat</p>
<p>is sleeping on your stomach</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t really have many benefits.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re putting yourself into a position</p>
<p>that is depending upon the orientation of your mattress</p>
<p>or how many pillows you&rsquo;re using,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re basically putting yourselves</p>
<p>into excessive extension of the lumbar spine,</p>
<p>which for most people isn&rsquo;t very good.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a disc patient,</p>
<p>I guess that might be helpful for relocating the disc.</p>
<p>But I mean, for the most part,</p>
<p>your hands are then usually not at your sides,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re up under your arms.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve got them into sort of internal rotation</p>
<p>up over elevation in your head.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just not a great position.</p>
<p>You also have to crank your neck</p>
<p>for one side or the other in order to breathe</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re gonna be your face down straight into the pillow.</p>
<p>So I would skip that one.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some people that are total belly sleepers.</p>
<p>And I would just say, listen,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that is the most healthful</p>
<p>long-term way for you to sleep.</p>
<p>Try to adopt a different position.</p>
<p>Sleeping on your side oftentimes</p>
<p>is also brought along with that.</p>
<p>The legs, knees coming up towards the chest,</p>
<p>prolonged hip flexion.</p>
<p>Listen, we&rsquo;re doing enough of that during the day.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t need to do it.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re doing right now.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t need to do another 10 hours or eight hours</p>
<p>or something at night like that.</p>
<p>And it just is reinforcing.</p>
<p>And as we said too, let&rsquo;s say you trained that day.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just reinforcing muscle shortening overnight</p>
<p>where the body is healing</p>
<p>and trying to create some changes in your body.</p>
<p>One of the reasons why I recommend stretching</p>
<p>or static stretching prior to going to bed.</p>
<p>A lot of people don&rsquo;t really wanna do it at that point</p>
<p>because it could take 10 minutes, five, 10 minutes,</p>
<p>depending upon how many muscles you have to stretch.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s good to sort of try to establish</p>
<p>this longer length temporarily prior to going into a state</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re gonna be non-moving and recovering</p>
<p>and creating new changes in the muscles.</p>
<p>So that kind of, I don&rsquo;t say it doesn&rsquo;t rule out</p>
<p>the side sleeper.</p>
<p>The side sleeper could be very, very helpful</p>
<p>for somebody that has apnea or other conditions.</p>
<p>So again, it&rsquo;s not an all or nothing approach,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s something that you need to pay attention to.</p>
<p>When you are on your back, like you were talking about,</p>
<p>your feet are wedged underneath a tight sheets</p>
<p>at the end of the bed.</p>
<p>And most of us, unless we consciously are pulling them up,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t prefer our beds to have really loose sheets</p>
<p>at the end of the bed.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s harder to make the bed in the morning.</p>
<p>Right, so it&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re gonna wanna have them tight.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m saying as you experienced,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna have this prolonged plantar flexion</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to likely lead to shorter calves over time</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re lacking all that length</p>
<p>for that long period of time that you could have</p>
<p>if you just loosened up the sheets</p>
<p>and allowed your feet to just hang out where they are.</p>
<p>Now, the resting position of the ankle</p>
<p>is not in dorsiflexion.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna be still in some plantar flexion,</p>
<p>but not being driven down and pulled down</p>
<p>into that position.</p>
<p>And I think what happens actually is people</p>
<p>who get uncomfortable that way, even in their sleep,</p>
<p>will shift away from that by turning either onto</p>
<p>their side or their stomach.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s definitely an impact of the body position</p>
<p>in sleep and figuring out the best way</p>
<p>that you can still sleep, of course, and get your rest,</p>
<p>but have a mindful eye towards what it&rsquo;s doing</p>
<p>to your body and choose the one that&rsquo;s least abrasive</p>
<p>to your body is the way you should go.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s terrific.</p>
<p>And again, it&rsquo;s really helped me.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m a big believer based on good science</p>
<p>out of Stanford and elsewhere that as much</p>
<p>as we can be nasal breathers in sleep,</p>
<p>we probably should be.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ve done any content yet</p>
<p>about taping the mouth shut with some medical tape,</p>
<p>but the benefits of nasal breathing in sleep</p>
<p>are pretty tremendous, but it takes a little bit</p>
<p>of training for people to do.</p>
<p>And the training is very simple.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little piece of medical tape.</p>
<p>So again, a topic for another time.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad you mentioned stretching.</p>
<p>I was gonna ask about stretching a little bit later,</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s talk about stretching.</p>
<p>When&rsquo;s the best time to stretch for particular</p>
<p>types of results?</p>
<p>And maybe you could define some of the different</p>
<p>types of stretching.</p>
<p>So you just mentioned a little bit of,</p>
<p>would you call it light stretching or,</p>
<p>okay, I&rsquo;m completely naive here on stretching.</p>
<p>So let me just say, I can think of stretching</p>
<p>where I hold the stretch and really try</p>
<p>and lengthen in air quotes, folks.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want the PTs jumping all over it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what it is, but nutrition</p>
<p>and the PTs online are really,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve got pitchforks in both hands.</p>
<p>Academics.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a recent evolution, I think, for sure.</p>
<p>And not the nutrition as much,</p>
<p>but the PTs have become a little bit angry these days.</p>
<p>I see.</p>
<p>Well, I always say with feelings of powerlessness</p>
<p>comes aggression.</p>
<p>Remember that, folks.</p>
<p>So in any case, there&rsquo;s stretching where I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>trying to consciously lengthen, again,</p>
<p>in air quotes, the muscle.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not yanking on the limb or bobbing up and down.</p>
<p>Maybe you could define the different types</p>
<p>of stretching for people.</p>
<p>Maybe give us some rough guidelines</p>
<p>about whether or not to do it cold or warm</p>
<p>before training, after training, et cetera.</p>
<p>So yeah, there&rsquo;s obviously, there&rsquo;s a lot</p>
<p>of different types of stretching there.</p>
<p>It could get even to PNF stretching</p>
<p>and things that are a little bit more niche.</p>
<p>But in general, the two basic forms of stretching</p>
<p>are active stretching and passive stretching.</p>
<p>Or your dynamic work.</p>
<p>And your passive stretching is done</p>
<p>with the goal of trying to create an increase</p>
<p>in the flexibility of the muscle.</p>
<p>So whether you&rsquo;re actually increasing</p>
<p>the length of that muscle,</p>
<p>more so what you&rsquo;re doing is increasing the resist,</p>
<p>or decreasing the resistance of that muscle</p>
<p>to wanna stay at a certain level of flexibility.</p>
<p>So when we can sort of take the brakes off</p>
<p>and allow that muscle to allow us more range of motion,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re inherently increasing flexibility</p>
<p>without necessarily having to increase</p>
<p>the length of that muscle.</p>
<p>That is usually done at a time far away</p>
<p>from your workout because they have shown</p>
<p>where this type of stretching done prior to an activity.</p>
<p>And it could be like a structured activity</p>
<p>like lifting, or it could be a little bit less structured</p>
<p>like competing in a sport in a spontaneous type way.</p>
<p>That there is a period of recalibration</p>
<p>that is needed after doing this</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re disrupting the length tension relationship</p>
<p>of the muscle that causes you to not necessarily</p>
<p>be able to rely on these,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked about before, stored motor engrams in your mind</p>
<p>in terms of this is the pattern</p>
<p>for how I swing a golf club, say.</p>
<p>Now introducing a little bit of flexibility</p>
<p>or added flexibility or range</p>
<p>because of the stretching I did before,</p>
<p>it takes maybe a hole or two or three to match up again.</p>
<p>Oh, this is what he&rsquo;s trying to do,</p>
<p>that golf swing thing that I remembered again.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s not remembering that every component,</p>
<p>like I have to bend my right wrist back 10 degrees</p>
<p>and then I have to bend my elbow and I have to break.</p>
<p>Like your body stores these patterns for motor efficiency.</p>
<p>So, and when I have to start matching up</p>
<p>that stored pattern with what&rsquo;s feeling new</p>
<p>because of the increased range, I can impair performance.</p>
<p>And again, it could happen even in a gym workout</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re talking about your first, second set,</p>
<p>third set, where maybe the repercussions aren&rsquo;t as big</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ll just do a few extra sets.</p>
<p>But in performance, if you screw up your first three rounds,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re playing on a PGA tour and you shoot,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re six over after three, you&rsquo;re done.</p>
<p>So, I think it matters there.</p>
<p>As far as the dynamic, so we relegate that,</p>
<p>as I mentioned, sort of towards the end of the day</p>
<p>when it&rsquo;s not going to impact performance,</p>
<p>but even maybe have the additional benefit</p>
<p>of creating the feeling of length or the increase</p>
<p>or decrease in resistance to this length</p>
<p>at a time when I know my body is going to try to tend</p>
<p>to heal and heal shorter, never longer, but heal shorter.</p>
<p>So, if I can introduce a little bit of that extra length</p>
<p>or decreased resistance to that length,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a better time to do it.</p>
<p>So, I think it promotes a better recovery.</p>
<p>If I want to-</p>
<p>Sorry to interrupt, stretching later in the day</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m intrigued by this concept of heal shorter.</p>
<p>So, part of the healing and recovery process</p>
<p>means a shortening of the muscles.</p>
<p>This is the tensing up in sleep.</p>
<p>Could you elaborate just a bit on that?</p>
<p>And then, sorry to break your flow, but then to continue.</p>
<p>Basically, what&rsquo;s been shown is that</p>
<p>when the repair process, muscular repair from,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say strength training during the day,</p>
<p>the repair process usually results in a muscle</p>
<p>that is slightly shorter rather than increased in length.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s muscles prefer to sort of ratchet their way down</p>
<p>into that contraction and then maintain</p>
<p>that more comfortable length tension relationship.</p>
<p>So, when you&rsquo;re sleeping, it tends to err on the side</p>
<p>of shorter rather than longer,</p>
<p>when ideally we don&rsquo;t really want that.</p>
<p>We want to maintain as much of that length</p>
<p>because with more length,</p>
<p>we actually have more leverage, right?</p>
<p>That muscle has more leverage to contract.</p>
<p>If it was all the way contracted, you really can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Obviously, we don&rsquo;t generate much force</p>
<p>in a muscle that&rsquo;s already maximally contracted.</p>
<p>So, I think we want to do something, whatever we can,</p>
<p>whatever little weapons we have in our arsenal</p>
<p>that could allow us to do this prior to sleep.</p>
<p>And again, it&rsquo;s just making a conscious choice</p>
<p>to do it at a time of the day</p>
<p>that makes a little bit more sense.</p>
<p>Dynamic stretching is really not done for that purpose</p>
<p>of trying to create any type of feeling</p>
<p>of increasing the potential length,</p>
<p>as you said, of the muscle,</p>
<p>but more so the readiness of the muscle to perform.</p>
<p>And increasing, exploring the ends of that range of motion</p>
<p>in a more dynamic way so you&rsquo;re not hanging out there</p>
<p>and disrupting that length tension relationship,</p>
<p>but just sort of touching the ends of those barriers</p>
<p>so that when you feel movement again, it feels looser,</p>
<p>it feels more ready.</p>
<p>And obviously, at the same time, warming up, blood flow,</p>
<p>all the benefits we get from just warming up in general.</p>
<p>So, that&rsquo;s a series you&rsquo;ve probably seen a bunch of times,</p>
<p>but leg swings and butt kicks and walking lunges</p>
<p>and all types of drills.</p>
<p>Toe touches.</p>
<p>Toe touches, all those kind of drills,</p>
<p>those active stretching drills,</p>
<p>or lunging with rotations of the upper body</p>
<p>to try to get some of the thoracic spine involved too.</p>
<p>Those are the drills that people will do prior to training</p>
<p>that are both excitatory in terms of just the nervous system</p>
<p>but also helpful for just the general warm up the body</p>
<p>because of the blood flow,</p>
<p>but from a muscle readiness standpoint,</p>
<p>not impairing the performance while at the same time,</p>
<p>exploring the increased ranges.</p>
<p>Because as you know, the first toe touch you do</p>
<p>is not as high as the last toe touch you do.</p>
<p>For me, it doesn&rsquo;t even include the toe.</p>
<p>Right, the shin touch.</p>
<p>Toe touch attempt.</p>
<p>Right, right.</p>
<p>So, those are going to improve with each subsequent rep.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s what people actually,</p>
<p>when you can see those actual changes</p>
<p>from rep one to rep seven,</p>
<p>you just feel ready.</p>
<p>You feel more alert and ready to go in your workout.</p>
<p>So, the dynamic type of stretching,</p>
<p>and I mentioned earlier on what I&rsquo;ve had to do</p>
<p>to sort of increase my warm up focus.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s more of what I try to do these days.</p>
<p>I try to be a little bit more alert to the fact</p>
<p>that my body&rsquo;s not ready.</p>
<p>When I was working with Antonio Brown,</p>
<p>I remember he would spend 20 minutes,</p>
<p>30 minutes on all dynamic work.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve never seen anybody spend that long</p>
<p>on their dynamic work,</p>
<p>but he said he just didn&rsquo;t feel right and ready to go</p>
<p>unless he did a lot of that.</p>
<p>And I mean, his dynamic stretching routine</p>
<p>would be a workout for most everybody.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s crazy how much he did.</p>
<p>These pro athletes are amazing.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ve had the great fortune of working with</p>
<p>and improving their abilities.</p>
<p>But I can only imagine,</p>
<p>because I also imagine he&rsquo;s pretty strong in the gym also.</p>
<p>I mean, it always amazes me,</p>
<p>the guys that make it to that level,</p>
<p>no matter what sport they do,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re so gifted in everything.</p>
<p>David Wright used to make me laugh all the time</p>
<p>with the Mets because no matter what I,</p>
<p>ping pong, like anything,</p>
<p>because of his hand-eye coordination,</p>
<p>like anything, great at.</p>
<p>Jump rope, I remember he hadn&rsquo;t done a lot of jump rope.</p>
<p>And I think jump rope&rsquo;s one of the best things you could do</p>
<p>from a conditioning standpoint.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually, it&rsquo;s fairly interesting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just, it&rsquo;s not too harsh on the joints,</p>
<p>depending on, even though it&rsquo;s a ballistic move.</p>
<p>And he wasn&rsquo;t, I have to admit,</p>
<p>if you listen to this, he&rsquo;s gonna wanna kill me,</p>
<p>but I was better at him than at jump roping,</p>
<p>one of the only things I could do.</p>
<p>And then I gave him about five days</p>
<p>and he completely blew me out of the water</p>
<p>to the point where I could never keep up with him anymore.</p>
<p>He made it look effortless.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, that&rsquo;s where the athlete in someone comes out.</p>
<p>No matter what they pick up, they&rsquo;re good at it.</p>
<p>And I think that when you see guys like this in the gym,</p>
<p>their strength levels tend to be pretty damn good</p>
<p>and their abilities, their coordination,</p>
<p>their everything just tends to sort of be good</p>
<p>at that level, and it sort of amazes me.</p>
<p>Why those guys can go pick up a golf club</p>
<p>and go shoot 72 and having never really played,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re just naturally good at whatever they do.</p>
<p>Yeah, I have a couple, I&rsquo;m smiling</p>
<p>because I have a couple of really close friends</p>
<p>who did a number of years,</p>
<p>some several decades in the SEAL teams.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know that their skill level at everything</p>
<p>is so high as you&rsquo;re describing for athletes,</p>
<p>but their level of competitiveness is beyond.</p>
<p>I ocean swim with one.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no chance that I&rsquo;m gonna outswim Pat ever, ever.</p>
<p>He actually goes back and forth sometimes</p>
<p>just to check up on me, which I appreciate.</p>
<p>Thank you, Pat.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t drowned yet.</p>
<p>But in addition to that, we could play horseshoes</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like this switch that just flips on</p>
<p>and like, he&rsquo;s gonna murder me at horseshoes.</p>
<p>And a very nice guy, right?</p>
<p>In general, they tend to be very nice,</p>
<p>but the level of competitiveness is kind of unreal.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re selected for it.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re trying to beat themselves.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not even trying to beat you.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not even in the competition.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not even in the competition.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not even there.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Now I won&rsquo;t feel so bad or worse.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a remarkable thing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad you mentioned jump roping.</p>
<p>I used to skip rope for warmup for boxing.</p>
<p>It was typically like three minute rounds</p>
<p>or something like that.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m glad you brought it up</p>
<p>because skipping rope is something</p>
<p>that obviously has a cardiovascular component.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the conditioning component, there&rsquo;s timing.</p>
<p>And it is kind of interesting, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s frustrating when you don&rsquo;t get it,</p>
<p>especially when it whips you on the ear</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re using a proper rope.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just curious if you could just give us</p>
<p>a quick skipping rope one-on-one.</p>
<p>Do you like to see people jumping with both feet and toes?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll link to a video if there was one and I missed it.</p>
<p>Do you like to see people doing high knees?</p>
<p>Do you like people basically like shuffling?</p>
<p>You want to see people doing double dutch?</p>
<p>What do you want to see people doing over time?</p>
<p>All of the above, maybe not the double dutch,</p>
<p>but all of the above.</p>
<p>I mean, I think that that&rsquo;s the cool thing about it, right?</p>
<p>Like once we sort of master the skill,</p>
<p>because for all of us, that first jump</p>
<p>with the two feet going together is a challenge</p>
<p>because you just got to time that rope,</p>
<p>you got to time your jump.</p>
<p>And then we get bored as we often do as humans,</p>
<p>we get bored with what we can do</p>
<p>and want to take on new challenges.</p>
<p>So then it becomes one leg at a time</p>
<p>or then it becomes side to side hops, right?</p>
<p>All of those things are beneficial, I believe neurologically</p>
<p>to enhancing the ability to do the skill as a whole,</p>
<p>but also just because I&rsquo;m such a believer</p>
<p>in training in all three planes.</p>
<p>So like just doing straight up and down</p>
<p>versus now I can do frontal plane, side to side motion,</p>
<p>and then I can even do small little twists</p>
<p>or corkscrews, we call them.</p>
<p>It requires a different,</p>
<p>you would know more about it better than I do.</p>
<p>It requires different neurological patterns</p>
<p>to be able to coordinate that</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re changing the orientation</p>
<p>of your body in space.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not just that I&rsquo;m changing the exercise,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m changing how my body interprets that exercise</p>
<p>because what&rsquo;s happening to my body in space.</p>
<p>So I love whatever people wind up doing,</p>
<p>but I am amazed.</p>
<p>There are people,</p>
<p>I just started following this young woman on Instagram</p>
<p>who is like, I&rsquo;ll give her a plug.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s like Anna Skips or something.</p>
<p>And she is ridiculous.</p>
<p>Like I watch her and I&rsquo;m like mesmerized</p>
<p>at what she can do with the rope.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s an extremely athletic endeavor</p>
<p>when it gets to be at that level</p>
<p>and the speed and the precision and the, you know,</p>
<p>I think one of the goals that you want to be able to have</p>
<p>is to where you&rsquo;re feeling</p>
<p>as if you&rsquo;re almost effortlessly dancing without a rope,</p>
<p>like where you&rsquo;re just bouncing off of the ball of your foot.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s an important skill to learn too,</p>
<p>whether you go back to run or, you know,</p>
<p>or even jog, right?</p>
<p>Just like, you know, more casual running.</p>
<p>Learning how to land is so important.</p>
<p>One of the drills that people should try</p>
<p>is like try to jump on your heels.</p>
<p>So just stand up, pull your toes off the ground, right?</p>
<p>And just jump from your heels and land on your heels.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll feel it in your jaw.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll literally feel your jaw rattle</p>
<p>when you land on your heels.</p>
<p>There is no shock absorption capabilities through your heels.</p>
<p>Meantime, a lot of people land on their heels a lot</p>
<p>when they run and you&rsquo;re just,</p>
<p>your body&rsquo;s not built to absorb the forces</p>
<p>like the ball of your foot could.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really built as a spring.</p>
<p>And the foot is, to me, as a physical therapist,</p>
<p>the foot has always been one of the most amazing,</p>
<p>you know, you talk about having bad feet.</p>
<p>I have flat feet.</p>
<p>It looks like I got flippers if I took my shoes off,</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;m wearing scuba fins.</p>
<p>There is no adaptability of that foot to the surface.</p>
<p>You know, when it&rsquo;s completely caved and flattened like that</p>
<p>the job of the foot is to be adaptable.</p>
<p>Well, maybe there is some adaptability</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s so floppy,</p>
<p>but at the same time, at some point,</p>
<p>that critical junction when you&rsquo;re gonna then step through</p>
<p>and you need to be able to push off,</p>
<p>the foot has to actually change this in the midfoot.</p>
<p>It has to change itself to become a rigid lever,</p>
<p>is what they call it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going from a mobile adapter to a rigid lever.</p>
<p>That rigid lever literally locks up the mid-tarsal joint</p>
<p>to become solid so that you can push off of it with leverage.</p>
<p>If you lack that capability,</p>
<p>all those stresses that are supposed to be borne by the foot</p>
<p>go up into the ankle, into the knee,</p>
<p>into the hip, into the low back.</p>
<p>So learning how to land and start to train your body</p>
<p>to experience ground reaction forces the right way</p>
<p>is so critical to all other function</p>
<p>and all other disability up the kinetic chain.</p>
<p>And jumping rope is like one of the best ways</p>
<p>to learn how to do that.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>I own a jump rope.</p>
<p>I love doing it in the morning</p>
<p>while I get sunlight in my eyes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually a protocol I picked up from Tim Ferriss,</p>
<p>who mentioned it,</p>
<p>because listeners of my podcast know</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like a broken record with get sunlight in your eyes,</p>
<p>even through cloud cover.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just sets your sleep rhythms</p>
<p>and your waking rhythms, yada, yada, yada, on and on.</p>
<p>But sometimes it&rsquo;d be kind of boring for people</p>
<p>and I want to get them off their phone.</p>
<p>So jumping rope is also just a great way to wake up.</p>
<p>So jumping rope can be the cardio workout,</p>
<p>the 15 or 30 minutes.</p>
<p>Definitely.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s sort of that hybrid</p>
<p>that we were talking about before of like,</p>
<p>no, you&rsquo;re not necessarily dropping down to the ground</p>
<p>and doing burpees,</p>
<p>but I just look at it as a more athletic endeavor</p>
<p>because of the coordination involved</p>
<p>than just simply walking or jogging.</p>
<p>Yeah, and it&rsquo;s not much of a equipment requirement,</p>
<p>very minimal cost.</p>
<p>You could even use a rope or something if you,</p>
<p>although-</p>
<p>We even instruct people that you use no rope</p>
<p>and just pretend, you know,</p>
<p>and just move the arms, right?</p>
<p>Truly zero cost.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re never going to hit the rope, which is good,</p>
<p>but you know, at the same,</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re never going to know if you&rsquo;re doing it wrong,</p>
<p>but at least you can move through the,</p>
<p>and get the same benefits through the feet.</p>
<p>I love it, I love it.</p>
<p>I told myself before sitting down with you today</p>
<p>that I wasn&rsquo;t going to focus on specific exercises</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s such a wealth of incredible content</p>
<p>that you put out there</p>
<p>that people could just put into YouTube or elsewhere</p>
<p>and arrive at the proper way to do a chin or a dip</p>
<p>or for whatever purpose.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s one exercise in one particular motion</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;d like to discuss for a moment</p>
<p>because I believe that learning about this</p>
<p>cautionary note from you is one of the reasons</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve maintained steady training for 30 years</p>
<p>with no major injury, knock on wood.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the upright row.</p>
<p>You know, one thing that,</p>
<p>whether or not people weight train or not.</p>
<p>I censor this podcast.</p>
<p>Are you censoring, do we beep this out or no?</p>
<p>Oh, are you, do you get beef about this?</p>
<p>You know what?</p>
<p>We always get beef in any social media platform</p>
<p>we ever put out, but like, no, I get some,</p>
<p>I get some from it,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m fully prepared to defend myself.</p>
<p>So the, but here&rsquo;s the reason for asking about this.</p>
<p>I never really cared much for upright rows.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not an exercise I tend to do,</p>
<p>but one thing that&rsquo;s apparent in all my colleagues</p>
<p>and every child I see and every adult I see</p>
<p>is that almost everybody is in inward rotation now.</p>
<p>So folks think if you stay,</p>
<p>I think I learned this from you all.</p>
<p>So if you stand up straight</p>
<p>and then you just point your thumbs out like a thumbs up,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re just pointing, your hands are down,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re pointing your thumbs straight out.</p>
<p>Ideally they would go straight out.</p>
<p>Most people, the thumbs are gonna be pointing</p>
<p>toward one another because most people are starting</p>
<p>to look somewhere between a non-human primate</p>
<p>and a melted candle, you know,</p>
<p>bent at the hips, et cetera, from too much sitting.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re all sitting, we&rsquo;re in inward rotation,</p>
<p>but I learned from you that the upright row</p>
<p>compromises some important aspects</p>
<p>of our shoulder mechanics</p>
<p>and can be actually sort of a dangerous movement</p>
<p>in some ways.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s a safe way for people to do it,</p>
<p>but so I&rsquo;ve always made it a point now</p>
<p>on the basis of this advice to A, not do upright rows,</p>
<p>but I wasn&rsquo;t doing them before,</p>
<p>but to really strive for external rotation</p>
<p>on things like bench dips,</p>
<p>on a number of different things.</p>
<p>Whenever I can, I try and go into external rotation</p>
<p>and provide, you know, without looking like an idiot,</p>
<p>walking around with my palms facing outward.</p>
<p>Please tell us about internal external rotation.</p>
<p>The upright row is one aspect of that,</p>
<p>but why this is so important,</p>
<p>not just for weight training,</p>
<p>but as in terms of posture and mechanics</p>
<p>and not looking like a melted candle</p>
<p>or partially melted candle.</p>
<p>I actually love it.</p>
<p>I am happy to talk about it</p>
<p>because I love the shoulder as a joint.</p>
<p>I think PTs tend to fall in love with certain areas</p>
<p>and the shoulder is one of the cool areas for me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the foot is,</p>
<p>but like the shoulder has the most mobility in the body</p>
<p>of any joint,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also got the least stability, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s always that trade-off of mobility and stability.</p>
<p>So your stability comes from, you know,</p>
<p>certain muscle groups.</p>
<p>And one of the ones that the only muscle group</p>
<p>that actually externally rotates the shoulder</p>
<p>is gonna be the rotator cuff, okay?</p>
<p>And unless you are devoted to training</p>
<p>through external rotation and exercises</p>
<p>that are going to externally rotate the shoulder,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not training that function.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s so easy for us in everyday life,</p>
<p>especially those that aren&rsquo;t training</p>
<p>to not ever really undergo any of those stresses</p>
<p>that could be beneficial to counteracting</p>
<p>what happens freely and naturally,</p>
<p>which is internal rotation.</p>
<p>So when you think about the imbalance created just by nature</p>
<p>and how we live our lives,</p>
<p>internal rotation far, far, far outweighs external rotation.</p>
<p>So you need to address it.</p>
<p>And the reason why you need to address it</p>
<p>is because you need to normalize</p>
<p>those biomechanics of the shoulder</p>
<p>if you want their long-term health.</p>
<p>And one of the functions of the shoulder</p>
<p>is to raise our arm up over our head.</p>
<p>And if we do that from an internally rotated position,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to have a higher likelihood</p>
<p>of creating stress inside that joint.</p>
<p>Funny thing is, I talked about before,</p>
<p>my PT brethren can be somewhat angry these days.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what happened, but fairly angry.</p>
<p>They wanna discredit the existence</p>
<p>of something like shoulder impingement,</p>
<p>which I don&rsquo;t know how, I mean, certain studies,</p>
<p>look at, we all read studies</p>
<p>and studies will say one thing one day</p>
<p>and potentially conflict entirely in a different direction.</p>
<p>Some studies will point to the non-existence</p>
<p>of a shoulder impingement.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, we have thankfully digital motion x-rays</p>
<p>that will literally show the impingement occur</p>
<p>in real time, in real function.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s one of the limitations,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m off on a tangent here,</p>
<p>but like those types of x-rays</p>
<p>or that type of fluoroscopy that we have nowadays,</p>
<p>like gives us such insight that we never had before</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re taking static x-rays</p>
<p>of someone laying down on a table.</p>
<p>You know, when I wanna see what happens</p>
<p>when you actually raise my arm up over my head in function,</p>
<p>and the tools now exist to do that.</p>
<p>We see the problems occurring</p>
<p>because in order to get normal mechanics</p>
<p>and free up the joint maximally inside,</p>
<p>you need to externally rotate as you raise the arm up.</p>
<p>So if your muscles aren&rsquo;t firing</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re not necessarily as strong</p>
<p>as the internal rotation bias that pulls them in,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re asking for trouble every time you do that.</p>
<p>Well, this exercise is literally putting you in elevation</p>
<p>and internal rotation.</p>
<p>And if you were to walk into a PT office</p>
<p>and someone said, I think he&rsquo;s got impingement,</p>
<p>will you diagnose him?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a test called the Hawkins-Kennedy test.</p>
<p>And I would put you in the position,</p>
<p>I know we&rsquo;re not visible at this point through the podcast,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ll put you in this position here</p>
<p>where I have your arm elevated</p>
<p>and your hand pretty much under your chin,</p>
<p>pushing downward on that</p>
<p>to create that internal shoulder rotation.</p>
<p>Pretty much the exact position that we&rsquo;re in</p>
<p>when we&rsquo;re holding a bar in an upright row.</p>
<p>Some will say, well, just don&rsquo;t go so high,</p>
<p>go only up to the level of the chest,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re still in this internally rotated position.</p>
<p>The thing that I think frustrates me the most</p>
<p>about the exercise is that I have an alternative.</p>
<p>And the alternative does the same thing</p>
<p>in terms of helping the muscles grow</p>
<p>by simply fixing the biomechanics of the exercise,</p>
<p>but just allowing the hands to go higher than the elbows.</p>
<p>So instead of the elbows being higher than the hand,</p>
<p>which drives you into internal rotation,</p>
<p>if the elbow is lower than the hand,</p>
<p>the hand being higher here, I&rsquo;m in external rotation.</p>
<p>And I could do something called a high pull</p>
<p>and still get the same abduction of the arm</p>
<p>and still get the same benefits of the shoulders,</p>
<p>the delts and the traps,</p>
<p>without having to undergo any of the stresses</p>
<p>that would come from the somewhat awkward movement</p>
<p>of an upright row.</p>
<p>And for those listening,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll put a link to a short clip of what this looks like,</p>
<p>but basically what Jeff is doing,</p>
<p>and tell me if I&rsquo;m describing this incorrectly or correctly,</p>
<p>Jeff is taking your two thumbs and pointing behind you,</p>
<p>and so elbows up kind of near the chin</p>
<p>and pointing behind you, like, oh, headed that way.</p>
<p>Like somebody directing the airplane,</p>
<p>like come back, come back, come back.</p>
<p>I forget what they call that.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s called semaphore,</p>
<p>is the action of like where they direct the planes</p>
<p>or something, the flags or whatever.</p>
<p>Someone will of course tell me I&rsquo;m wrong about that too,</p>
<p>which is why I say these things,</p>
<p>because I like being told what the correct answer is.</p>
<p>In any case, so this replaces the upright row</p>
<p>and probably does a number of other important things</p>
<p>as well.</p>
<p>Again, listen, without naming names or programs</p>
<p>or anything like that, when I got involved,</p>
<p>when I got involved in ATHLEANX</p>
<p>when I first started my online presence,</p>
<p>there was a very, very, very popular program</p>
<p>that was out there that I just for fun,</p>
<p>I wanted to, as a PT, this is the nerdy things we do,</p>
<p>but I wanted to evaluate the workout structure.</p>
<p>And I went and I looked at every rep</p>
<p>over the course of a week,</p>
<p>and there was something like 890 repetitions</p>
<p>or something done,</p>
<p>and zero of them were dedicated</p>
<p>to external rotation of the shoulder.</p>
<p>So if you think about it, I mean, yeah,</p>
<p>it was a very popular program</p>
<p>that was done by a lot of people.</p>
<p>There was no focus at all,</p>
<p>no dedicated focus towards creating a balance</p>
<p>to an action that is so predominant.</p>
<p>And remember, it&rsquo;s not just because we sit with that posture</p>
<p>but the fact that our chest can internally rotate,</p>
<p>our lats can internally rotate.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s like muscle, other big muscles</p>
<p>that participate in things that we do every day</p>
<p>that will further internally rotate the shoulder.</p>
<p>The only weapons we have for external rotation</p>
<p>are those little rotator cuff muscles,</p>
<p>and three of them actually, three of the four.</p>
<p>And the job is to sort of actively</p>
<p>and consciously train them</p>
<p>through really the boring exercises, right?</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;ve seen them with the band,</p>
<p>you anchor a band to a pole,</p>
<p>you stand with the band in the opposite hand.</p>
<p>So if it&rsquo;s anchored to the pole on my left side,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got the band on my right side,</p>
<p>and you see people where they kind of rotate their hand</p>
<p>towards the back.</p>
<p>Again, kind of what you were saying,</p>
<p>but at a lower elevation,</p>
<p>taking the back of my hand</p>
<p>and trying to point it to somebody behind me.</p>
<p>Well, that is one of the ways to train the muscle.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a one function of the shoulder,</p>
<p>external rotation of the shoulder,</p>
<p>and you need to do it.</p>
<p>And again, it&rsquo;s not that,</p>
<p>if somebody was doing more external rotation work,</p>
<p>could they absorb the upright row better?</p>
<p>Probably, because as they elevated the arm,</p>
<p>they probably have a little bit more</p>
<p>of a contribution from the rotator cuff</p>
<p>to one of the functions is to centralize</p>
<p>the head of the humerus inside of the glenoid,</p>
<p>you know, the capsule.</p>
<p>So as it rises up,</p>
<p>it stays central as opposed to migrating up</p>
<p>because the deltoid likes to pull up.</p>
<p>So if the rotator cuff has some ability</p>
<p>to counteract the upward pull of the delt,</p>
<p>then it can maintain a more healthy relationship</p>
<p>with overhead movement.</p>
<p>So just realizing that that function</p>
<p>is only gained through doing these exercises,</p>
<p>you know, we would probably dedicate more time there,</p>
<p>but the upright row might be better absorbed by that person</p>
<p>because they have a little bit more strength.</p>
<p>But again, why?</p>
<p>Because if you have an exercise that does the same thing</p>
<p>for what you&rsquo;re trying to do muscularly</p>
<p>to build the muscles that it affects,</p>
<p>why wouldn&rsquo;t you just do it</p>
<p>where you can still see,</p>
<p>actually pick up more repetitions of external rotation?</p>
<p>You know, so you&rsquo;re getting none of the harm,</p>
<p>all of the benefits.</p>
<p>I see zero reason to ever do the upright row.</p>
<p>And people will argue, this is the way they argue that,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done this for 30 years and I&rsquo;ve never hurt myself.</p>
<p>And I always say, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Like, listen, the goal is to not hurt yourself ever.</p>
<p>So even if you, it&rsquo;s sort of like, you know,</p>
<p>the championship game, you know,</p>
<p>you might play the game of your life,</p>
<p>but if you lose, you lost.</p>
<p>And when you get into the end of the record books,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re still lost.</p>
<p>So even if you had the game of your life, you lost,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care if you do it for 30 years, no pain,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re still doing it and there&rsquo;s no pain.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m giving you an option</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s gonna give you the same results</p>
<p>in the exercise that you&rsquo;re seeking.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why you&rsquo;re doing the exercise</p>
<p>without the possibility of having the bad outcome</p>
<p>come from it.</p>
<p>So, you know, I get a little bit defensive of the move,</p>
<p>but I feel like it&rsquo;s like, why would you do that?</p>
<p>You know?</p>
<p>It makes sense.</p>
<p>Being able to train for a long period of time and feel good,</p>
<p>you know, I&rsquo;m proud to say, you know,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t have the kind of genetics</p>
<p>where like we don&rsquo;t have a lot of impressive athletes</p>
<p>in our family tree or anything.</p>
<p>There are some fit individuals, some less fit individuals,</p>
<p>but I really believe it&rsquo;s about putting in the work</p>
<p>consistently over time.</p>
<p>And the more often you can wake up not in pain, the better.</p>
<p>And so, you know, I think that being in external rotation</p>
<p>as often as possible is good.</p>
<p>This is actually a good friend who&rsquo;s a yoga teacher</p>
<p>told me this is also a problem with the yogis,</p>
<p>you know, all the downward dog stuff.</p>
<p>For those listening, you can think of inward rotation</p>
<p>as like thumbs down, just like thumbs down.</p>
<p>Inward rotation isn&rsquo;t bad, but less thumbs down,</p>
<p>more thumbs up is external rotation.</p>
<p>So for those just listening, maybe that gives a visual.</p>
<p>The more exercise you can do in external rotation,</p>
<p>the better it seems on average.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to chat with you just a little bit more</p>
<p>about biomechanics.</p>
<p>And this is a personal thing that, again,</p>
<p>your content really helped solve for me.</p>
<p>One is I thought I had lower back pain,</p>
<p>but I had sciatica so badly that on a few trips,</p>
<p>I worked trips years ago when I was doing</p>
<p>a lot more international travel.</p>
<p>I mean, it was hard to stand up sometimes.</p>
<p>I mean, like excruciating pain.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t want to take medication.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t want to do back surgery.</p>
<p>In the end, turns out it wasn&rsquo;t a back injury at all.</p>
<p>And one of the things that helped fix it</p>
<p>was just learning about this thing called the medial glute.</p>
<p>And you had a video that said fixed back pain,</p>
<p>and then you quite accurately say that some back pain</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t really about the back at all.</p>
<p>And had me do an exercise or allowed me to try an exercise</p>
<p>where I lay on my side and essentially pointing my toe down,</p>
<p>the top toe down, almost like pointing a toe down,</p>
<p>and then would slowly lift the leg up</p>
<p>while pointing the toe down.</p>
<p>Maybe I got it correct here.</p>
<p>And then holding that, and there&rsquo;s a muscle</p>
<p>that sort of sits at the top of the glute.</p>
<p>It kind of peaks out every once in a while.</p>
<p>You can feel it there with your thumb,</p>
<p>which is I think you had pushed back on it a bit,</p>
<p>creating that mind muscle link again.</p>
<p>And there with proprioception,</p>
<p>the actual feeling of a muscle literally with a limb,</p>
<p>we know based on the neural circuits for movement</p>
<p>that that enhances the contractile ability of a muscle.</p>
<p>So like if you touch your bicep,</p>
<p>you literally can contract it more strongly.</p>
<p>And this makes total sense</p>
<p>based on neuromuscular physiology.</p>
<p>So had me do that repeatedly.</p>
<p>I started doing that in my hotel room</p>
<p>and the pain started to disappear.</p>
<p>And then it came back again in the afternoon.</p>
<p>So I did it again in the afternoon.</p>
<p>So this is something I did for three or four days.</p>
<p>And lo and behold, my back pain&rsquo;s gone.</p>
<p>I handed this off to my father</p>
<p>because he like me has a slightly lower right shoulder.</p>
<p>I think our gait is probably thrown off by this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably a genetic thing.</p>
<p>Who knows?</p>
<p>He handed off to somebody.</p>
<p>It turns out that we don&rsquo;t suffer from back pain.</p>
<p>And in fact, now I don&rsquo;t suffer from any pain</p>
<p>because I was doing this exercise,</p>
<p>which I think is helping my medial glute.</p>
<p>Two reasons why I raised this.</p>
<p>One, I know a lot of guys who have right side sciatica</p>
<p>because we want to keep the wallet there is one idea</p>
<p>or left side sciatica.</p>
<p>There are a lot of people, male and female,</p>
<p>who think they have back pain</p>
<p>when they don&rsquo;t actually have back pain.</p>
<p>And the other thing is that is about a general question</p>
<p>about biomechanics or statement about biomechanics.</p>
<p>I had a feeling that a lot of what people think</p>
<p>is back pain or knee pain or neck pain</p>
<p>or headache or shoulder pain</p>
<p>is actually the consequence of something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s happening above or below that site of pain.</p>
<p>And this is a whole landscape of stuff related to PT</p>
<p>and recovery and pain management.</p>
<p>But maybe you just educate us a bit on this</p>
<p>and why this works.</p>
<p>What is the medial glute?</p>
<p>Why did it make my so-called back pain disappear?</p>
<p>And how should people think about pain?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d like to use this as a segue</p>
<p>to get into a little bit deeper discussion</p>
<p>about pain and recovery.</p>
<p>Sure, so this is definitely like a big cornucopia</p>
<p>PT stuff here, but like, and this is what I love.</p>
<p>So first of all, that video,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s my proudest video that I have.</p>
<p>And the reason being is that it&rsquo;s helped so many people.</p>
<p>Like we get comments on that video every day.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even know how many of you</p>
<p>have got now 30 some odd million or it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot.</p>
<p>We will link to it.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s a lot of views.</p>
<p>And quite honestly, it was a little bit</p>
<p>of an afterthought video in terms of its origin.</p>
<p>I think that that day, maybe Jesse was having some problems</p>
<p>or something like that, a little bit of low back pain</p>
<p>and I showed him and it helped right away.</p>
<p>I was like, well, you know, we can make a video on it.</p>
<p>Cause this will help people.</p>
<p>You know, not everybody, you know,</p>
<p>if you have a real disc problem, it&rsquo;s not gonna help,</p>
<p>you know, because you&rsquo;re not changing</p>
<p>the structural problem that&rsquo;s there.</p>
<p>But as you said, a lot of people don&rsquo;t, you know,</p>
<p>and even disc issues, you know,</p>
<p>a lot of them are non-operative.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;d want to try these things first.</p>
<p>As far as what you sort of experienced,</p>
<p>sometimes as that glute medius really tightens down</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s again from poor biomechanics</p>
<p>up and down the kinetic chain,</p>
<p>it can actually press on the sciatic nerve</p>
<p>and give you what they call a pseudo sciatica,</p>
<p>you know, where it&rsquo;s not like you&rsquo;re making it up.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like you&rsquo;re not feeling that pain</p>
<p>over that same sciatic distribution,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not caused from a disc.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not caused from something mechanical there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s caused by the fact that this glute medius</p>
<p>has posturally become a problem for you or weak,</p>
<p>you know, because you don&rsquo;t train it</p>
<p>and you need to address it.</p>
<p>So like, unlike, not unlike any other muscle in the body,</p>
<p>there are common trigger points and common areas</p>
<p>where the muscle will become tightened</p>
<p>or painful or spasmed.</p>
<p>And you can basically apply pressure to these areas</p>
<p>to and then sort of thread that muscle through the pressure</p>
<p>by pushing down through there</p>
<p>and then contracting the muscle,</p>
<p>which is why you go through that action of,</p>
<p>you know, I think we call it a toe stabber,</p>
<p>but like stabbing down and lifting up</p>
<p>and stabbing down and lifting up,</p>
<p>taking that glute medius through its function.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s basically kind of working</p>
<p>underneath the downward pressure of the finger.</p>
<p>And that tends to help you to almost, you know,</p>
<p>need out what might be that trigger point.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why people can see immediate relief there</p>
<p>because once the trigger point lets go,</p>
<p>it feels like, and that&rsquo;s what the comments are</p>
<p>in that video, like, my God, I literally, I couldn&rsquo;t walk.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been on my hotel floor.</p>
<p>I did this and I&rsquo;m fixed.</p>
<p>And meanwhile, then, you know,</p>
<p>it could come back because your body is like,</p>
<p>well, I like being more like this.</p>
<p>This is how I&rsquo;ve been, you know, ingrained to be.</p>
<p>So it might come back,</p>
<p>but then when you do another round of it</p>
<p>and another round of it,</p>
<p>and then finally it starts to say, all right,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not gonna do that anymore.</p>
<p>It kind of eases up and you can relieve yourself</p>
<p>of those trigger points.</p>
<p>You could do that up and down the back.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s other people that get that</p>
<p>and that sort of inside their shoulder blade, you know,</p>
<p>that same type of cramping in another area.</p>
<p>But once that takes place,</p>
<p>well, then the job that I think people have</p>
<p>is like become educated that, you know,</p>
<p>the glute medius is different than the glute maximus.</p>
<p>You know, like their functions are different.</p>
<p>You know, you have to work on not just extending the hip,</p>
<p>but also abduction of the hip, external rotation of the hip.</p>
<p>Same thing as in the shoulder.</p>
<p>And this actually segues nicely</p>
<p>into the whole concept you were talking about.</p>
<p>Like the body is like a mirror image.</p>
<p>The hip is like the shoulder, right?</p>
<p>The ankle is the wrist.</p>
<p>The foot is the hand.</p>
<p>Like the knee is the elbow.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re two hinge joints.</p>
<p>They function that way.</p>
<p>Well, with the shoulder,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got that mobility that comes</p>
<p>from having all that freedom of motion,</p>
<p>but the stability is lacking.</p>
<p>Well, the same thing with the hip,</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;ve got mobility,</p>
<p>but if you don&rsquo;t fully stabilize it</p>
<p>by training all of the muscles of the hip,</p>
<p>and if you don&rsquo;t strengthen the external rotation</p>
<p>of the hip, then, you know, you&rsquo;re gonna have issues.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s not biomechanically gonna work the same way.</p>
<p>If you think of the body as a series of, you know, bands,</p>
<p>you know, pulling in different directions</p>
<p>at different levels of tension, you know,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re being pulled into one direction or the other</p>
<p>just by the balance of tension from one weak area</p>
<p>to one dominantly tight area.</p>
<p>And you need to make sure</p>
<p>that you can sort of balance this out</p>
<p>in order to eliminate some of the adaptations</p>
<p>and compensations that happen.</p>
<p>So what I say when we look at sort of the body as a whole,</p>
<p>most often, wherever you&rsquo;re feeling the pain</p>
<p>is absolutely not to blame.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not blame.</p>
<p>It is somewhere above or below, as you hinted at.</p>
<p>You know, you&rsquo;re talking about the knee</p>
<p>is my favorite example of it.</p>
<p>Whenever you have knee pain, patellar tendonitis,</p>
<p>which I have forever.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had, you know, bad, bad cases of patellar tendonitis</p>
<p>where squatting is very difficult for me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the knee.</p>
<p>The knee is literally a hinge joint that, you know,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s minor rotation capabilities in the knee,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a hinge joint.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s being impacted by the hip and the ankle</p>
<p>and in the foot.</p>
<p>As I said before, how critical the foot is.</p>
<p>If you thought of the knee</p>
<p>being like the middle of a train track</p>
<p>where the femur down your thigh</p>
<p>and your shin down below your knee were the train track,</p>
<p>well, what would happen if the foot collapses at the bottom?</p>
<p>All of a sudden, that train track on the bottom</p>
<p>gets torqued just a little bit.</p>
<p>Well, who&rsquo;s gonna feel that the most?</p>
<p>The area where it&rsquo;s torquing, which is at the knee.</p>
<p>So the stresses are gonna be felt there.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the problem is the foot</p>
<p>or the problem is the ankle.</p>
<p>People that are chronic ankle sprainers</p>
<p>are almost always gonna wind up having back pain</p>
<p>because the ankle sprain causes weakness</p>
<p>and maladaptations in the ankle</p>
<p>that then gets connected through the chain.</p>
<p>Because now once I distort the ankle and the shin,</p>
<p>now the knee is trying to maintain</p>
<p>its ability to hinge smoothly.</p>
<p>So it torques on the femur to do that.</p>
<p>Well, the femur is now inside the hip joint</p>
<p>pulling on the pelvis and the pelvis is at a whack.</p>
<p>So it really is fascinating.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of my favorite things about how the body works</p>
<p>is how interconnected it is</p>
<p>and how one little thing somewhere</p>
<p>causes repercussions somewhere else.</p>
<p>And the easiest way to find out what your problem is</p>
<p>is to say, okay, I know where my symptom is,</p>
<p>but I gotta find someone who can help me</p>
<p>find the source somewhere else</p>
<p>because it is gonna be usually either above or below.</p>
<p>Mostly usually below</p>
<p>because it usually translates up the kinetic chain.</p>
<p>But usually it&rsquo;s gonna be below where the real source is.</p>
<p>So people with low back pain</p>
<p>usually have hip issues.</p>
<p>Weaknesses, tightnesses, flexibility issues,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost always below.</p>
<p>When you get into really high performance athletics though,</p>
<p>it almost works the other way.</p>
<p>Like where we have pitchers who can&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m always fascinated by guys</p>
<p>that have Tommy John issues in their elbow, right?</p>
<p>Pitchers, like if you can&rsquo;t externally rotate the shoulder</p>
<p>that we talked about again,</p>
<p>the ability to get your shoulder back</p>
<p>into external rotation,</p>
<p>well, your arm has to get to a certain position</p>
<p>for release of the baseball.</p>
<p>And if it can&rsquo;t get there</p>
<p>because you can&rsquo;t externally rotate the shoulder</p>
<p>to get there,</p>
<p>then the elbow has to sort of torque more</p>
<p>in order to allow the arm to get back further.</p>
<p>And it will try to take some of that motion</p>
<p>from a joint that&rsquo;s not really,</p>
<p>again, another hinge joint,</p>
<p>really capable of doing that.</p>
<p>So it starts to stress that medial elbow ligament</p>
<p>to get a little bit further back</p>
<p>because the shoulder is not working.</p>
<p>And that just ultimately places a strain on the elbow.</p>
<p>So when you see a guy that has pain that floats around,</p>
<p>a pitcher that floats around their arm,</p>
<p>all that is is sort of this balance of compensation.</p>
<p>Once his shoulder elbow starts hurting,</p>
<p>then he can&rsquo;t get the range from the elbow.</p>
<p>So he tries to dig a little bit further back</p>
<p>into external rotation</p>
<p>and then the rotator cuff gets inflamed.</p>
<p>And then he feels that&rsquo;s inflamed.</p>
<p>So by the way, during that time period,</p>
<p>it takes some of the strain off the elbow</p>
<p>so the elbow feels better.</p>
<p>Then he decides, okay, now I got the external rotation,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m getting too much of that.</p>
<p>So now I start straining the elbow again</p>
<p>and it keeps going through this cycle.</p>
<p>So your body is very smart</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s gonna compensate every single time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna find the compensation,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s no guarantee that that compensation</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t leave you with a whole host of other issues.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>In another lifetime, I would have gone and been a PT,</p>
<p>although it sounds like the community among PTs online.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what, listen, we&rsquo;re good people,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s like.</p>
<p>Yeah, scientists and neuroscientists</p>
<p>can get into pretty intense battles.</p>
<p>Coming from the academic community,</p>
<p>the etiquette is so different online</p>
<p>because I would say, I think in person,</p>
<p>people would probably behave a bit differently.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;d shake your hand and say hello.</p>
<p>Yeah, they&rsquo;d shake your hand and say hello.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s also, look, I&rsquo;ll just be very direct about this.</p>
<p>There are a lot of people online</p>
<p>for whom their only content is pointing out</p>
<p>the misunderstandings or alleged flaws of other people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the bulk of their identity,</p>
<p>which to me is sort of a sad existence.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s always more to gain</p>
<p>by thinking about what&rsquo;s possible</p>
<p>and what&rsquo;s new and what&rsquo;s good,</p>
<p>but to each their own demise or win.</p>
<p>I mean, questioning what&rsquo;s out there,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s healthy, it&rsquo;s normal, it&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>It actually sparks conversation.</p>
<p>But as you said, some people&rsquo;s existence</p>
<p>is solely to find things to nag about</p>
<p>and not actually with the goal being to advance anything,</p>
<p>but rather just to, you know.</p>
<p>Yeah, in the world of science,</p>
<p>being skeptical but not cynical is encouraged.</p>
<p>But I always say that the longer</p>
<p>that somebody&rsquo;s in a career path,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s certainly in science or medicine,</p>
<p>and they realize how hard it is to do various studies.</p>
<p>Once they publish a few studies,</p>
<p>generally they sort of get a better understanding</p>
<p>of how the various things are done.</p>
<p>In any case, along the lines of pain and pain relief</p>
<p>and misunderstandings about the origins of pain in the body,</p>
<p>one of the great tools that I picked up from your content,</p>
<p>which has benefited, I know, a huge number of people,</p>
<p>is I think I used to hold weights</p>
<p>sometimes in the tips of my fingers</p>
<p>as opposed to in the meat of the palm of my hands,</p>
<p>and I had elbow pain.</p>
<p>And I always thought that I felt it most</p>
<p>on tricep exercises and pushing exercises,</p>
<p>and I thought I was doing those exercises wrong.</p>
<p>Turns out, toward the end of my pull-ups or my bicep work,</p>
<p>I was letting the weight or the bar</p>
<p>drift into my fingertips.</p>
<p>And the mere shift to making sure</p>
<p>that my knuckles were well over the bar</p>
<p>or that the weight was really in the meat of my palms</p>
<p>has completely ameliorated that</p>
<p>for reasons that you point out,</p>
<p>and maybe you could just share with us why that is.</p>
<p>You have this kind of finger pull exercise.</p>
<p>Usually when someone says, pull my finger,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like a bad middle school or elementary school joke,</p>
<p>but here-</p>
<p>Well, this one will say, push your finger.</p>
<p>Right, right.</p>
<p>You know, yeah, this is fascinating.</p>
<p>This is because it just shows, again,</p>
<p>how intricate the body is and how responsive</p>
<p>or over-responsive it can be to something so little.</p>
<p>And, you know, what you&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>is that when you grip a bar,</p>
<p>whether it be through a curl or whether it be,</p>
<p>and this is mostly pulling exercises</p>
<p>because the tendency for the bar</p>
<p>is gonna be to fall out of your hand,</p>
<p>not like with a pushing exercise</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s kind of, you&rsquo;re pushing your hand into the bar,</p>
<p>so on a bench press, say.</p>
<p>That bar can drift just by gravity,</p>
<p>doing its thing, or fatigue of the hand grip strength</p>
<p>can start to drift further away</p>
<p>towards the distal digits, right,</p>
<p>through those last couple knuckles</p>
<p>that we have on our hands.</p>
<p>And though our hand can still hold it there,</p>
<p>the muscles are not equipped to handle those types of loads.</p>
<p>And that can start at a very,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not gonna say light, but like, you know,</p>
<p>it can start at, you know, dumbbell weight,</p>
<p>you know, 40 pounds, 30 pounds, you know,</p>
<p>even 25 pounds for some,</p>
<p>depending upon their overall strength levels.</p>
<p>But then when you start to apply it to something</p>
<p>like your body weight with a chin-up, right,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s natural for the bar</p>
<p>to somewhat kind of float down towards your fingertips.</p>
<p>And it actually is a little bit easier</p>
<p>to perform the exercise with that sort of,</p>
<p>like, false grip, little hook grip at the end,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re not gonna engage the forearms</p>
<p>into the exercise,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not gonna start pulling down.</p>
<p>But at the same time,</p>
<p>while it could help you to perform them better</p>
<p>by getting the back more activated,</p>
<p>if you have weakness in these muscles,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not a thing that happens to every,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not one of those upright row type things</p>
<p>where I think this is happening to everybody.</p>
<p>This is happening to people</p>
<p>that have these inherent weaknesses in these muscles.</p>
<p>You, or haven&rsquo;t done enough of the gripping</p>
<p>in the meat of the hand, you know, for long enough.</p>
<p>But it starts to put that stress on these muscles</p>
<p>that are ill-equipped to do this,</p>
<p>and to handle this, and it starts to,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s particularly on that fourth finger, you know,</p>
<p>which is part of the muscle we call the FDS,</p>
<p>the flexor digitorum,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s just too much for it to handle.</p>
<p>And that comes all the way down</p>
<p>and meets right at the medial elbow,</p>
<p>right on that spot that you can say</p>
<p>feels like someone&rsquo;s knifing you</p>
<p>right in the middle, in that medial elbow.</p>
<p>And medial epicondylitis,</p>
<p>or they call it golfer&rsquo;s elbow,</p>
<p>is something that a lot of us deal with in the gym.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of the most common inflammatory conditions</p>
<p>people get from the gym,</p>
<p>and it all comes from this positioning</p>
<p>of the dumbbell, or barbell,</p>
<p>or hand on a pull-up bar over time.</p>
<p>So the easiest thing to do is just grip deeper</p>
<p>so that what you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>is you&rsquo;re using more leverage from the palm</p>
<p>to encapsulate the bar, or the dumbbell, or whatever,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re not putting that pressure</p>
<p>really distally right on that last digit,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s where that FDS muscle is most strained.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re just almost eliminating that from the equation.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s one of those exercises</p>
<p>that the load can exceed its capacity pretty quickly,</p>
<p>so that like, you know,</p>
<p>maybe it&rsquo;s only capable of handling 30 pounds,</p>
<p>and then when you&rsquo;re doing a chin-up,</p>
<p>and it goes and it drifts so far that it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>now let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re a 200-pound guy,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got, let&rsquo;s say, 100 pounds through one arm,</p>
<p>and 100 pounds, this is simplified math</p>
<p>that obviously is offset by other muscles,</p>
<p>but 100 pounds through one arm, 100 pounds to the other arm,</p>
<p>or 100 pounds off of a muscle that can handle 30,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not gonna take many repetitions to strain it,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re gonna feel that maybe by the time that sets over,</p>
<p>or certainly by the time that workout&rsquo;s over,</p>
<p>or the next day you wake up</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve got that notable stabbing pain.</p>
<p>Whenever someone feels that,</p>
<p>the best thing would be to determine,</p>
<p>okay, what exercises was I doing that were pulling,</p>
<p>and where the bar could have drifted deeper,</p>
<p>further from the meat of my palm into my fingers,</p>
<p>and figure out a way to deepen that grip.</p>
<p>When that happens, though, the best thing to do</p>
<p>with most of these inflammatory conditions</p>
<p>is not do any of that stuff for a little while.</p>
<p>Not ever, just for a little while.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s always things that you can do around it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying ever do I say, like,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t go to the gym, or don&rsquo;t find something you can do,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m saying that particular exercise</p>
<p>that you feel the pain on while you&rsquo;re doing it,</p>
<p>never a smart idea to do that exercise when it&rsquo;s inflamed.</p>
<p>If you are doing exercise and it hurts,</p>
<p>you probably shouldn&rsquo;t do the exercise,</p>
<p>because another reason for the variability of exercises,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so many other options that you can do</p>
<p>that will train similar muscles,</p>
<p>or even the same motion, and not cause that stress.</p>
<p>I mean, a cable curl would be much easier to do that on</p>
<p>than, let&rsquo;s say, a chin-up,</p>
<p>where you don&rsquo;t have the control over the weight,</p>
<p>like you do by moving a pin on a stack.</p>
<p>I think that that is a common thing that people find,</p>
<p>and the best thing to do is just figure out</p>
<p>how deep are you gripping that bar,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re gonna find that, oh my God,</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t realize that, because it was just,</p>
<p>even though you might start a set in a good position,</p>
<p>and then it drifts away as you go.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think that&rsquo;s what was happening to me,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m very conscious of this now.</p>
<p>Again, for me, I haven&rsquo;t had this elbow pain at all,</p>
<p>so very fortunate.</p>
<p>So again, a debt of gratitude to you.</p>
<p>I thought there was something wrong with my elbow,</p>
<p>basically, and I thought maybe it was tennis elbow.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even play tennis, so there you go.</p>
<p>Other aspects of recovery and variables for recovery.</p>
<p>I think you and I both put out content</p>
<p>about the use of cold, and I think we can summarize it</p>
<p>by saying, yeah, it does seem like cold water immersion</p>
<p>immediately after hypertrophy restraints workouts</p>
<p>might be a problem, but a cold shower</p>
<p>is probably not a problem.</p>
<p>What about heat?</p>
<p>Do you personally use heat and cold,</p>
<p>saunas, hot baths, hot compresses?</p>
<p>By you, I mean you personally and athletes that you coach</p>
<p>or people that you coach.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts on the use of heat and or cold?</p>
<p>Well, I think it might just be an inherited practice</p>
<p>from the days of trainers since Babe Ruth,</p>
<p>but we, in baseball, we used a lot of cold</p>
<p>following performance, just because the idea would be</p>
<p>there is some, especially pitchers,</p>
<p>there is some inflammation that is abnormal.</p>
<p>The arm is not really designed to do what they do,</p>
<p>especially at the speed that they move it</p>
<p>and everything else, so we would use ice</p>
<p>as a pretty standard practice after that.</p>
<p>But not a lot of heat, we don&rsquo;t usually use a lot of heat,</p>
<p>and of course, from the recovery or the healing aspect,</p>
<p>that actually becomes rather personal preference</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve found now after, let&rsquo;s say, the first 12 to 24 hours</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re really trying to control inflammation</p>
<p>of what you know might be an injury,</p>
<p>but then it can kind of shift to personal preference</p>
<p>because the heat can bring blood to the area also,</p>
<p>and then the cold has its sort of anti-inflammatory effects,</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s a balance between</p>
<p>which one&rsquo;s working better for you.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s really no standard anymore</p>
<p>for heat or cold in that way,</p>
<p>but from a standpoint of post-workout healthy status,</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t used much heat or cold in terms of what we do.</p>
<p>We cover the topic of the cold showers</p>
<p>and to try to dispel the myth of the,</p>
<p>even people saying that there&rsquo;s giant testosterone releases</p>
<p>and all kinds of stuff that,</p>
<p>listen, we hear all kinds of things,</p>
<p>because people want, I think the idea</p>
<p>of just turning the water cold and being in it for 30 seconds</p>
<p>and then all of a sudden magically growing</p>
<p>three times your size is intriguing for a lot of people,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s why they ask these questions,</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re like, that would be a hell of a lot easier</p>
<p>than going to the gym and training hard,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m always fascinated by some of the stuff</p>
<p>that you talked about.</p>
<p>In fact, we started to talk about some of the stuff</p>
<p>in terms of cooling and what it can do on performance,</p>
<p>and that was, there&rsquo;s some untapped territory there</p>
<p>that I think you&rsquo;re finding out about.</p>
<p>Yeah, what would be fun would be</p>
<p>to bring the CoolMitt technology from Stanford.</p>
<p>My colleague, Craig Heller&rsquo;s lab at Stanford</p>
<p>has done really important and amazing work in this area,</p>
<p>but then it moved on to some other things.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s also working on Down syndrome,</p>
<p>and he works on a number of other really important topics</p>
<p>as scientists often do,</p>
<p>but I have access to this CoolMitt technology.</p>
<p>No relationship to the company, by the way.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;d love to come out to your facility</p>
<p>and we can do the blind type studies.</p>
<p>Like the blue blocker test.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly, exactly, and see how that goes</p>
<p>with somebody as advanced trained as you.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s probably the best thing to do.</p>
<p>So content for the future.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think heat and cold are kind of staples</p>
<p>in the PT world, and it does seem like people use them</p>
<p>slightly differently, but they are kind of</p>
<p>the macronutrients of recovery there, along with sleep.</p>
<p>I do have a question about precision of record keeping.</p>
<p>Do you keep a training journal?</p>
<p>Do you recommend people keep training journals?</p>
<p>Are you neurotically fixed to cadence of movement,</p>
<p>and are you looking at the,</p>
<p>do you have a buzzer going off when it&rsquo;s 90 seconds rest?</p>
<p>Is it 90 seconds rest?</p>
<p>I confess I have my slow workouts and my faster workouts,</p>
<p>and they scale with whether or not I&rsquo;m training heavier</p>
<p>with longer rest, or whether or not</p>
<p>maybe midway through a workout,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll shift over to doing higher repetition, lower rest.</p>
<p>This is kind of my crude way of keeping time,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m not, will be just to kind of watch the clock,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m not neurotically fixed to the buzzer,</p>
<p>nor am I on social media during my workouts,</p>
<p>which is actually a way to really improve workouts</p>
<p>is to just not be on social media.</p>
<p>Yeah, I can&rsquo;t claim that I&rsquo;m not guilty of that.</p>
<p>Sometimes I am on social media,</p>
<p>but sometimes I&rsquo;m trying to post something.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s different.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s your profession.</p>
<p>But I mean, I&rsquo;m not necessarily</p>
<p>chained to some sort of protocol in terms of how I do.</p>
<p>I think by this point, I&rsquo;ve been doing this a long time,</p>
<p>and not only is it something that I&rsquo;ve done for a long time,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a passion of mine, something I really enjoy.</p>
<p>So I probably inherently have the ability</p>
<p>to stick to these guidelines in terms of rest time,</p>
<p>to know what I lifted even six months ago on a lift</p>
<p>and how it felt without journaling it,</p>
<p>but I recognize the value it has to a lot of people.</p>
<p>It goes back to that whole my muscle connection idea</p>
<p>that we talked about in the beginning.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lack of awareness for all aspects of training,</p>
<p>especially maybe it isn&rsquo;t your interest level.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking, you and I, from a position of interest.</p>
<p>This is what we do.</p>
<p>We enjoy just how our bodies work</p>
<p>and understanding how they work.</p>
<p>Some people don&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>They just want the end result.</p>
<p>But journaling and keeping track of that</p>
<p>raises awareness to where you&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>oh my God, I have been on Instagram</p>
<p>for the last seven minutes</p>
<p>and I was supposed to be back at my next set in 90 seconds.</p>
<p>There is a training effect of that.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re training for a metabolic overload,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve blown that opportunity because you haven&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>your rest time was very important</p>
<p>to that protocol working as it should.</p>
<p>If you were training for strength,</p>
<p>maybe the extra few minutes doesn&rsquo;t matter so much.</p>
<p>When you get back under the bar, you might find,</p>
<p>I mean, you might find that it&rsquo;s a better response</p>
<p>for your body to rest even longer</p>
<p>than you&rsquo;ve been told three, four minutes, five minutes.</p>
<p>And so that way, maybe it helps.</p>
<p>But I think that anything you can do</p>
<p>to increase your awareness of your performance</p>
<p>and also give yourself some objective goal,</p>
<p>whenever we have an objective goal,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a lot easier to actually obtain it.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re just there to get a pump</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re just there to lift how you feel that day,</p>
<p>you have to be incredibly disciplined</p>
<p>in all other aspects of your workout</p>
<p>in order to make that effective.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve done that too.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve actually been able to do that too.</p>
<p>But again, the level of repetitions</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve accumulated over the course of my life</p>
<p>and the amount that I read about this stuff.</p>
<p>And I think I&rsquo;m able to get away with that.</p>
<p>But I think more often than not,</p>
<p>what I&rsquo;m doing is not journaling,</p>
<p>but journaling in my head</p>
<p>exactly what I think people should be doing.</p>
<p>And that is getting a specific effect</p>
<p>from what you&rsquo;re trying to do.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not so haphazard.</p>
<p>You wanna get a specific effect,</p>
<p>just like any other experiment that you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re doing an experiment on your own body</p>
<p>with your own weights,</p>
<p>which to me is one of the most empowering things</p>
<p>someone can ever do.</p>
<p>When they get bitten by the bug</p>
<p>for exercising and training.</p>
<p>And I like to use the word training</p>
<p>rather than exercise</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s a purpose behind it.</p>
<p>But when they get bitten by that training bug</p>
<p>and they start to see actual changes in results,</p>
<p>you know how empowering that is?</p>
<p>Because we can&rsquo;t really control</p>
<p>that many things in our life, unfortunately.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s some things that happen to us</p>
<p>that we really wish never happened.</p>
<p>And those are not something</p>
<p>that we can do anything about.</p>
<p>But this is one thing that we can do our best to.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t avoid disease entirely.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t predict when we&rsquo;re gonna die.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t do those things,</p>
<p>but we can certainly decide to show up</p>
<p>into the gym that day</p>
<p>and get a workout in</p>
<p>or go for a run or do something.</p>
<p>And by doing that,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re giving yourself, I think,</p>
<p>a better chance at a higher quality of life.</p>
<p>So anything you can do</p>
<p>to increase your awareness of it</p>
<p>and keep you on track with that</p>
<p>is like I&rsquo;m endorsing fully.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t agree more.</p>
<p>I could not agree more.</p>
<p>There is a topic,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s sort of a dreaded topic,</p>
<p>but I think it&rsquo;s an important one</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s the topic of nutrition.</p>
<p>And rather they get into specific meal programs</p>
<p>which would take hours</p>
<p>and probably wouldn&rsquo;t even manage</p>
<p>to scratch the surface even with hours.</p>
<p>If we could talk about principles around nutrition.</p>
<p>What are sort of the themes</p>
<p>that you think people should keep in mind</p>
<p>when thinking about how to eat generally?</p>
<p>And pre-training and post-training</p>
<p>are two particularly sensitive times</p>
<p>for most or times that people want to know a lot about.</p>
<p>You know, what should they eat before training</p>
<p>or can they train fasted?</p>
<p>What should they eat afterwards?</p>
<p>But just in general,</p>
<p>what do you think are some axioms</p>
<p>of nutrition that really hold?</p>
<p>And I ask this because,</p>
<p>not because there&rsquo;s a lot of debate about this,</p>
<p>but because you&rsquo;ve been around this space a long time</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve seen what works for you obviously,</p>
<p>but for other people too.</p>
<p>You know, what tends to work, what tends not to work?</p>
<p>And how should we think about nutrition?</p>
<p>I mean, look, you&rsquo;ve touched on it a bit,</p>
<p>but like, you know,</p>
<p>nutrition can be a touchy subject for people.</p>
<p>And I understand where that comes from.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked about before</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a dogmatic tendency to nutrition</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a reason for it</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s an area that people struggle with</p>
<p>more than anything else.</p>
<p>And the reason why people struggle with nutrition</p>
<p>is because the commitment is extremely high.</p>
<p>You know, you could start a workout program</p>
<p>and actually get to the gym three to five times a week.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s five hours</p>
<p>based on how you and I were discussing it before.</p>
<p>Well, what about the other 23 hours of each of those days?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s opportunity to eat incorrectly or unhealthily</p>
<p>every one of those hours.</p>
<p>People wake up in the middle of the night to go eat.</p>
<p>You know, like there are things that you can do</p>
<p>that can cause amazing amounts of damage to your longevity</p>
<p>in the 23 hours, not the one hour, the 23 hours.</p>
<p>So when people finally figure out a way</p>
<p>to make that work for them, it&rsquo;s very passionate.</p>
<p>And I understand their passion.</p>
<p>I do, like I&rsquo;ve put out, so my approach,</p>
<p>my approach is like, I&rsquo;ve always been sort of a low sugar,</p>
<p>lower fat guy.</p>
<p>I made the mistake of going no fat years ago</p>
<p>and I paid for it.</p>
<p>I was like in college.</p>
<p>Back in the day, we were the same age.</p>
<p>We read all the magazines and that was what we had.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t have the internet then.</p>
<p>So we were reading magazines</p>
<p>and the recommended path was to go low fat.</p>
<p>It helps you to become hypocaloric very easily</p>
<p>because the density of the calories in a gram of fat</p>
<p>versus a gram of carbohydrates or protein</p>
<p>is nine versus four for the carbs and protein.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re cutting out grams of fat on a daily basis,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re quickly cutting out calories</p>
<p>that allows you to get leaner.</p>
<p>Well, of course, as everything,</p>
<p>I mean, if little is good, then a lot is better.</p>
<p>So I would cut all of them out or almost all of them.</p>
<p>And at the age of 22, 21,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like standing at a stop up at University of Connecticut</p>
<p>waiting for the tram to come and bring me to campus.</p>
<p>And I couldn&rsquo;t even open my eyes</p>
<p>because the light was blinding to me.</p>
<p>It was normal sunlight.</p>
<p>It was blinding to me.</p>
<p>The photosensitivity I had,</p>
<p>learning later on after a few more courses</p>
<p>that I took there in biology,</p>
<p>how necessary fat was</p>
<p>for the development of healthy cells,</p>
<p>I realized what was going on.</p>
<p>Then not to mention other stuff,</p>
<p>skin was bad, hair was falling out, all kinds of stuff.</p>
<p>So I think that the approach to decreasing fat</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s not excessive,</p>
<p>because again, how calorically dense it could be</p>
<p>and having lower sugar.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a firm believer in sugar is really pretty toxic.</p>
<p>And something that we would all do better</p>
<p>getting rid of a lot of it.</p>
<p>That is the best approach for, I believe,</p>
<p>again, in my opinion,</p>
<p>personally for the overall big picture.</p>
<p>Because though the people can take exclusionary approaches</p>
<p>to nutrition and taking carbs out</p>
<p>or eating only fats and proteins,</p>
<p>or again, I&rsquo;m not saying it doesn&rsquo;t work for you.</p>
<p>And if it&rsquo;s the first thing that actually allowed you</p>
<p>to gain control of your nutrition</p>
<p>to the point where you actually saw results</p>
<p>and got to a healthier weight,</p>
<p>then I always say, then do it, then do it.</p>
<p>But just make sure it&rsquo;s something you can do forever</p>
<p>and doesn&rsquo;t bring upon other repercussions.</p>
<p>But I think that non-exclusionary approaches to diets</p>
<p>are the most sustainable for the rest of your life.</p>
<p>And all I&rsquo;m interested in from a nutrition standpoint</p>
<p>is something that&rsquo;s sustainable.</p>
<p>So when I preach what I preach,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been doing this since I was 15, 14.</p>
<p>People say like, how does he get so ripped?</p>
<p>I have been doing this for how many years?</p>
<p>30 years?</p>
<p>30 years.</p>
<p>Eating clean, low sugar.</p>
<p>Yeah, 30 years.</p>
<p>And in the beginning, it was a slow shift I had to make</p>
<p>where I was like, I went from the worst diet</p>
<p>in the whole world.</p>
<p>I was, even when I was 14 years old,</p>
<p>my breakfast was, I&rsquo;ve talked about this so many times,</p>
<p>but like enemons.</p>
<p>I would eat enemons, you know, donuts and crumb.</p>
<p>Those long road, it was like a strip, yeah.</p>
<p>And crumb donut.</p>
<p>They even took the whole out of the donut.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>Why would you delete the middle of the donut?</p>
<p>You know, the crumb donut there.</p>
<p>I would eat donuts.</p>
<p>I can taste it in my, I don&rsquo;t like sugar very much,</p>
<p>but over the years, I&rsquo;ve lost my appetite for sugar.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>But as you talk about the Entwined Stones,</p>
<p>I can literally smell and taste the frosting.</p>
<p>And to me now, it&rsquo;s disgusting,</p>
<p>but back then it might&rsquo;ve been appetizing.</p>
<p>You would probably have like really good information</p>
<p>on this, but like my ability to actually remember,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ve said smell is very evoking of memories, right?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a, smell is unlike the other senses</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s a direct line, literally,</p>
<p>from our sense of smell to the memory centers of the brain.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t have to go through any intermediate station.</p>
<p>Okay, so you know, my ability to actually recall</p>
<p>exact taste of all the stuff that I used to love</p>
<p>is enough to satisfy me to not engage in those things now,</p>
<p>as crazy as that is.</p>
<p>I like, I almost get my fill through remembering</p>
<p>because of these strong senses of memory</p>
<p>of what it was like.</p>
<p>It was, oh, that used to taste so good.</p>
<p>Okay, that&rsquo;s good, I had it.</p>
<p>So-</p>
<p>Fantastic.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s, we know the neuromodulator there,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s dopamine.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Your ability to get the dopamine release</p>
<p>from the thought of something.</p>
<p>Most people, when they get that dopamine release,</p>
<p>it causes a triggering of the desire for more.</p>
<p>Right, people think of dopamine as pleasure.</p>
<p>Dopamine, there&rsquo;s a book, great book</p>
<p>called The Molecule of More.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t write the book, unfortunately,</p>
<p>but someone else did.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a great book.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s really about how dopamine,</p>
<p>we think it&rsquo;s about pleasure, but it establishes craving.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re able to satisfy that.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a very adaptive thing for you</p>
<p>because you are indeed very lean.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s one of your kind of hallmark things.</p>
<p>And as a professional who does this in the public space,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s important when people are out there</p>
<p>talking about getting lean and you look at them</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re like, maybe you need to do the protocols.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a huge advantage.</p>
<p>But yeah, I think that it sounds like</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve cultivated practices around avoiding certain things.</p>
<p>Yes, yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, but not, you know,</p>
<p>avoiding certain things that I think are easily avoided</p>
<p>if you realize that there,</p>
<p>I mean, I think that we have enough science</p>
<p>and literature out there to prove that</p>
<p>the altered path is a better path.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>Like, I feel like if I was just doing it</p>
<p>because I wanted to be lean,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not quite sure it would have held for so long, you know?</p>
<p>And we have a guest that,</p>
<p>whose episode has been recorded for this podcast,</p>
<p>who runs an eating disorder clinic</p>
<p>at the University of Pennsylvania Medical School,</p>
<p>studies binge eating disorders, anorexia, OCD.</p>
<p>And he will go on record, and obesity,</p>
<p>and he will go on record saying that</p>
<p>these very highly palatable processed high sugar foods</p>
<p>of the sort that we&rsquo;re talking about,</p>
<p>donuts and so forth,</p>
<p>that they are actually dangerous, right?</p>
<p>That there are elements of the way</p>
<p>that they engage neural circuitry.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a neurosurgeon that reshaped the brain</p>
<p>in dangerous ways.</p>
<p>And those are his words.</p>
<p>And I-</p>
<p>Yeah, tank enemas, for sure.</p>
<p>Yeah, and it&rsquo;s not just enemas.</p>
<p>I mean, I think, not just enemas, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, they&rsquo;re coming after us with,</p>
<p>with what?</p>
<p>With donuts.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Yeah, they can&rsquo;t catch us.</p>
<p>True, true.</p>
<p>In any case, so in terms of what you do eat,</p>
<p>how do you structure that in terms of,</p>
<p>when you look down at a plate,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve done these, described this before,</p>
<p>but I think it&rsquo;s just a beautifully simple description</p>
<p>because I think a lot of people</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t want to do calorie counting and all this.</p>
<p>And how should people think about what to eat?</p>
<p>So yeah, I have what I like, what I call a plate method.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just simple because it works for me.</p>
<p>And again, if you&rsquo;re struggling with real eating issues,</p>
<p>these mechanisms become admittedly less effective</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re having,</p>
<p>maybe you have emotionally triggered eating</p>
<p>and you can&rsquo;t stop at one plate.</p>
<p>I mean, you could get the plate right,</p>
<p>but if the portions are out of control.</p>
<p>Plate.</p>
<p>Plate has a dimensionality of height.</p>
<p>Or multiple plates, you know,</p>
<p>like second and third plate, right, or plate, right?</p>
<p>Like then I, you know, all of these things</p>
<p>can be challenged.</p>
<p>But what I say is when you have your plate,</p>
<p>then you just simply look at it as like a clock, right?</p>
<p>And if you just make a 9.20 on the clock,</p>
<p>so one arm goes over to the nine</p>
<p>and one of the arms goes over to 20.</p>
<p>Well, then you&rsquo;re basically,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna take the second largest portion of that,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re gonna make a line towards 12 o&rsquo;clock too.</p>
<p>And the largest portion</p>
<p>is gonna be your fibrous carbohydrates.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the green vegetables, right?</p>
<p>So whether it be broccoli or Brussels sprouts or asparagus,</p>
<p>or, you know, pick your favorites, you know?</p>
<p>Like those are the ones</p>
<p>that give us a lot of the micronutrients we need.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re the ones that are generally, you know,</p>
<p>accepted as more healthy.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re also gonna provide the fiber</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s gonna be both beneficial</p>
<p>in terms of its impact on insulin</p>
<p>and also just through filling you up, right?</p>
<p>And then I take the next largest portion of that</p>
<p>and I devote that towards protein.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s really important,</p>
<p>especially for anybody active.</p>
<p>The more active you are,</p>
<p>the more you embark on trying to build muscle.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna need to have protein in every meal.</p>
<p>So I have that.</p>
<p>And again, you know,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re talking cleaner sources of protein,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;ll never find like boiled chicken on my plate.</p>
<p>Like I ditched those days when I was 16 or 15 or 16.</p>
<p>Like I realized after reading those bodybuilding magazines</p>
<p>that maybe the low fat thing stuck for too long,</p>
<p>but the, or the no fat thing stuck for too long,</p>
<p>but the boiled chicken and, you know,</p>
<p>a steamed broccoli thing that ended quickly for me.</p>
<p>Cause I really, I&rsquo;m not gonna eat this forever.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll have some sort of fish or chicken,</p>
<p>but it will be cooked in a way that&rsquo;s like, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s got maybe some sauce on it,</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s got some, maybe it&rsquo;s tomato sauce,</p>
<p>anything to just make it a little bit more palatable</p>
<p>and interesting without blowing the value of the meal.</p>
<p>And then that last portion</p>
<p>is where I put my starchy carbohydrates.</p>
<p>And again, that&rsquo;s the part that some people will say,</p>
<p>exclude them entirely,</p>
<p>cause they&rsquo;re not healthy or they don&rsquo;t work for you,</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;re not, you know, beneficial long-term.</p>
<p>For me, it&rsquo;s been a godsend.</p>
<p>And I do think I&rsquo;m like most people,</p>
<p>my body craves those carbohydrates.</p>
<p>I choose things like sweet potatoes, which is my favorite,</p>
<p>or I&rsquo;ll have rice or I&rsquo;ll have pasta.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Italian, so I like pasta.</p>
<p>And like, I will have those things.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not excluding them,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t put them in the portions</p>
<p>that you would generally find.</p>
<p>You know, my wife and I will go out</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll go to the restaurant sometimes,</p>
<p>like because we travel quite a bit,</p>
<p>or used to at least with baseball too.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a cheesecake factory everywhere you went.</p>
<p>And I love cheesecake factory,</p>
<p>but like the way they structure meals is,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all rice on the bottom</p>
<p>and a little bit of chicken on top.</p>
<p>And I mean, it&rsquo;s a plate full of rice.</p>
<p>That, you wouldn&rsquo;t find me make a plate that way.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna just devote that portion of the plate</p>
<p>to the starchy carbohydrate.</p>
<p>And so it gives me a little bit more responsibility</p>
<p>in terms of portion control,</p>
<p>because those are the foods,</p>
<p>again, probably, you know, dopamine driven</p>
<p>that are most easily overeaten.</p>
<p>I always ask the question,</p>
<p>when&rsquo;s the last time you ate 10 chicken breasts at a meal?</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;re getting sick of it after maybe two or three,</p>
<p>but you could eat a whole hell of a lot of carbohydrates,</p>
<p>starchy carbohydrates, because they&rsquo;re just so satisfying.</p>
<p>And I think those triggers, as you said,</p>
<p>that want more, like that&rsquo;s what happens, right?</p>
<p>You just keep, even when you&rsquo;re feeling full,</p>
<p>you want more.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the biggest danger to carbohydrates.</p>
<p>So if you can develop some sort of discipline around them,</p>
<p>then you can still enjoy them.</p>
<p>If you can&rsquo;t develop that discipline for whatever reason,</p>
<p>then maybe they do become something</p>
<p>that you have to work yourself around</p>
<p>or adopt a different eating style.</p>
<p>And as I said, I&rsquo;m never to the point</p>
<p>where I&rsquo;m not trying to be dogmatic in my approach.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m always trying to say, this is how I do it.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m a believer in it,</p>
<p>just like everyone else is a believer in their method.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m open to the idea that something that works for you</p>
<p>and gets you to a healthier weight and a sustainability,</p>
<p>like that is good.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s good for me, you know,</p>
<p>provided it doesn&rsquo;t introduce other issues, you know?</p>
<p>Yeah, something one can do consistently.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s something I picked up from you over the years.</p>
<p>You know, what can you do consistently?</p>
<p>And for me, that also meant when and how can I eat,</p>
<p>what can I eat consistently</p>
<p>that will also allow me to be alert after lunch</p>
<p>so I can actually get some work done.</p>
<p>Or eat, I like to train fasted in the morning,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t do any long-term fasting.</p>
<p>It just so happens that I&rsquo;m fine doing water and caffeine</p>
<p>in the morning and training in the morning,</p>
<p>and then I eat my first meal afterwards.</p>
<p>But I get carbohydrates at night,</p>
<p>so my glycogen is restored.</p>
<p>I think carbohydrates are wonderful.</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t eat them in excess.</p>
<p>So to me, I feel like when,</p>
<p>what you describe as a very rational,</p>
<p>literally balanced approach,</p>
<p>and obviously there will be variations</p>
<p>for people who are dealing with obesity or diabetes,</p>
<p>or, you know, I&rsquo;ve got friends</p>
<p>that are on the pure carnivore thing.</p>
<p>I have friends that are vegan,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s always impressive to me</p>
<p>when somebody can stick to anything consistently,</p>
<p>except when they&rsquo;re sticking to just poor behavior,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s nothing impressive about that.</p>
<p>Well, I think that that&rsquo;s very helpful,</p>
<p>because I think there&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>for the typical listener of this podcast,</p>
<p>you know, the online content that people see,</p>
<p>the battles are very confusing.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re distracting, because people really think,</p>
<p>oh, there&rsquo;s a right way and a wrong way,</p>
<p>and it sounds like the way that one can eat consistently</p>
<p>over time that&rsquo;s healthy.</p>
<p>Certainly fewer processed and sugary foods.</p>
<p>I think almost everybody agrees there.</p>
<p>Yeah, almost everyone agrees on that, right?</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s calorie manipulation</p>
<p>through some other method, right?</p>
<p>So even intermittent fasting, like you said,</p>
<p>that could be, it&rsquo;s for people that are grazers.</p>
<p>Like, if you are a grazer and your real problem</p>
<p>is portion control over the course of the day,</p>
<p>but you can respond to a rule that says,</p>
<p>no, you&rsquo;re eating between here and here,</p>
<p>that you can obey that rule,</p>
<p>well, you&rsquo;re not gonna be able to graze</p>
<p>during the times that you might be doing additional damage.</p>
<p>So sure, there&rsquo;s other hormonal benefits</p>
<p>that people will talk about from that approach,</p>
<p>but from a longevity standpoint and habit-forming standpoint,</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s fixing the habit that you&rsquo;re breaking too often</p>
<p>by eating throughout whenever you feel</p>
<p>like you walk by food, it&rsquo;s good, and it works.</p>
<p>And again, people will tell you</p>
<p>you can probably eat whatever you wanna eat</p>
<p>as long as you&rsquo;re eating within that window,</p>
<p>but I think the more responsible people</p>
<p>who are practitioners of that will say,</p>
<p>no, you still wanna avoid processed sugar</p>
<p>and things like that.</p>
<p>So, and that&rsquo;s just a mechanism of eating,</p>
<p>not really a diet, right?</p>
<p>But I think that people,</p>
<p>I hate to be as basic as it sounds with that,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s for the exact reason that</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s that 23-hour-a-day phenomenon</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s like, you said you&rsquo;re impressed, it is impressive.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so hard to control all of our behaviors</p>
<p>and food being one of the hardest,</p>
<p>one of the biggest temptations for people.</p>
<p>You gotta learn how to control that for so long</p>
<p>and then do it day after day after day.</p>
<p>Whatever that mechanism is that works for you is impressive,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a believer in it.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s how I feel.</p>
<p>I just feel like people need to be able</p>
<p>to be given some reins to be able</p>
<p>to find what works for them.</p>
<p>Well, I love to eat,</p>
<p>and one of the beauties of weight training</p>
<p>is I feel like I can eat plenty for my age,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m not as lean as you are,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m happy with where I&rsquo;m at.</p>
<p>I could always do better.</p>
<p>With each year, actually, I&rsquo;ve been getting better,</p>
<p>probably because I&rsquo;m eating cleaner,</p>
<p>probably because I also have someone to cook for me now,</p>
<p>and we like healthy food, and so I&rsquo;m very fortunate.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think we have any packaged food in our home.</p>
<p>We even started making sauerkraut at home.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t make it.</p>
<p>She makes it.</p>
<p>My wife, actually, she turned me on to a tip</p>
<p>that I actually shared with the whole channel,</p>
<p>which was you can go to,</p>
<p>we have a Stu Leonard&rsquo;s</p>
<p>around our big grocery store chain around us,</p>
<p>and they have a catering department,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re often used for catering big parties</p>
<p>and big tubs of grilled chicken,</p>
<p>but really good grilled chicken.</p>
<p>Again, not the boiled chicken,</p>
<p>but big tubs of sweet potatoes,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll get a bunch of those,</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;ll go over and she&rsquo;ll get them,</p>
<p>and then she&rsquo;ll sort of arrange them on plates</p>
<p>and put the plates in,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m okay with repetitive eating.</p>
<p>I think more people are probably okay</p>
<p>with repetitive eating than they think.</p>
<p>I think that when you actually break down</p>
<p>how many different breakfast variations do you have,</p>
<p>three, two?</p>
<p>Two or three maximum.</p>
<p>So I think when people do,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s more variety for dinner probably,</p>
<p>but even there, you probably eat</p>
<p>five different types of dinners</p>
<p>over the course of a week or a month.</p>
<p>Well, if you have that ability</p>
<p>to identify the things that you like,</p>
<p>and again, no plan is gonna work</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re eating stuff you don&rsquo;t like.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not gonna work forever.</p>
<p>Nothing will.</p>
<p>You have to really enjoy what you&rsquo;re eating.</p>
<p>As long as these variations of this meal</p>
<p>are something that you really enjoy,</p>
<p>and there are limited versions of them,</p>
<p>the reproducibility of that is simple.</p>
<p>It will take some time,</p>
<p>but if you&rsquo;re fortunate enough in our case</p>
<p>to have somebody who can prepare it for you,</p>
<p>now that&rsquo;s even part out of the equation,</p>
<p>and it just makes it very simple,</p>
<p>but I do think when you tally up</p>
<p>all the costs of medical care</p>
<p>that are spiked by having poor nutrition,</p>
<p>and you then offset that by what it might cost you</p>
<p>to invest in a faster strategy</p>
<p>like this catering trick or whatever it might be,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d be best off figuring out a way</p>
<p>to maybe reallocate some of your money</p>
<p>to preparing this because you know</p>
<p>how important it is to your long-term health and longevity.</p>
<p>If you can figure out your nutrition issues,</p>
<p>if everyone listening to this podcast</p>
<p>can figure out their nutrition issues,</p>
<p>this whole world will be different.</p>
<p>That is like one of the largest sources of disease</p>
<p>and pain and discomfort</p>
<p>because people really struggle with nutrition.</p>
<p>Yeah, and it&rsquo;s a huge problem.</p>
<p>I mean, the obesity, it is an epidemic in this country.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very, very serious.</p>
<p>Also, a lot of highly processed foods</p>
<p>are more expensive than healthier foods</p>
<p>when you really break it down.</p>
<p>Even the better sourced high-quality foods</p>
<p>are right there on par,</p>
<p>less than the processed foods, for sure.</p>
<p>I have a couple other questions as it relates to training</p>
<p>because I think that one thing</p>
<p>that a lot of people wonder about,</p>
<p>and maybe we could do this in kind of a true-false method</p>
<p>just to get through some of these.</p>
<p>50-50, I&rsquo;ll get it right at least.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Men and women should train differently.</p>
<p>The science of it will say false.</p>
<p>The, and again, not to generalize,</p>
<p>but kind of the point you touched on earlier today,</p>
<p>I do find that casually interested women in training</p>
<p>will migrate more towards certain types of fitness,</p>
<p>like kickboxing, like dancing, like-</p>
<p>Low-rest circuit type.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>And I think, again,</p>
<p>whatever it is that you&rsquo;re going to engage in regularly</p>
<p>is what you should do.</p>
<p>Physiologically, no.</p>
<p>And I think if we can get more women</p>
<p>to feel more comfortable in the gym,</p>
<p>performing the same exercises and the same,</p>
<p>and receiving the same strength training benefits</p>
<p>and working on progressive overload,</p>
<p>and like, you know, we&rsquo;ve hit the holy grail.</p>
<p>But I think that it&rsquo;s a big bridge</p>
<p>that has to be gapped still</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s just some reality to,</p>
<p>listen, there are very,</p>
<p>my wife is a perfect example of this,</p>
<p>living a very complicated, busy life.</p>
<p>We have two young boys, they&rsquo;re twins,</p>
<p>and her attention and focus is there, you know?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, she doesn&rsquo;t do this for a living like I do.</p>
<p>And if she can get a decent workout in, she&rsquo;s happy,</p>
<p>you know, but she&rsquo;s not necessarily</p>
<p>working on her deadlift PR, you know?</p>
<p>And so I think that that would help her</p>
<p>and serve her in the longterm</p>
<p>to work on increasing her PRs and different lifts</p>
<p>and building her strength progressively.</p>
<p>You know, in her life right now,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not necessarily in the cards</p>
<p>to have the time to focus on that.</p>
<p>So would you then discourage, you know,</p>
<p>this other thing that she might find interesting,</p>
<p>like some boxing, you know, there&rsquo;s a little,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t remember the brand,</p>
<p>but like one of those punchable boxing stand-up things,</p>
<p>you know, and she enjoys it, you know?</p>
<p>And, you know, like anything to get you moving</p>
<p>is gonna be preferable,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t think that necessarily physiologically</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a difference.</p>
<p>You started weight training pretty young.</p>
<p>Yeah, I messed around, you know, with my brother</p>
<p>because he was older, he was four years older.</p>
<p>So I was kind of messing around with weights,</p>
<p>probably 12 or 13 with a five pound dumbbell.</p>
<p>Okay, yeah, you hear that young kids</p>
<p>shouldn&rsquo;t work out with the weights.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what the going standard is now.</p>
<p>They say, you know, shuts down long bone growth</p>
<p>or growth plates, you know, this sort of thing.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got two young boys, adorable kids, by the way.</p>
<p>Yeah, one of the things that is very heartwarming</p>
<p>is to see that you&rsquo;re in great shape,</p>
<p>extremely bright, you know, your craft,</p>
<p>you love your craft.</p>
<p>You work with Jesse, who we&rsquo;ll talk about as well.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>You know, which is great, you know,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a camaraderie there,</p>
<p>having great teammates as part of a business</p>
<p>or to work out with is just makes life better.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just be honest.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m grateful to have great teammates for the podcast</p>
<p>and my lab, of course, as well.</p>
<p>But to see your boys and your dogs</p>
<p>and the whole picture, you know, it&rsquo;s a, you know,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure it has a lot of contours and complexity</p>
<p>that we don&rsquo;t know about and shouldn&rsquo;t know about,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a beautiful picture.</p>
<p>And will they weight train?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen the videos of one or both of them</p>
<p>hanging from the bar.</p>
<p>These kids are naturals.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m telling you that.</p>
<p>I wonder where they get it from.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even, you know, I don&rsquo;t even encourage it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not gonna be the dad who&rsquo;s sitting there</p>
<p>and say, let&rsquo;s go son.</p>
<p>Yeah, we got our two days here.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not gonna do that,</p>
<p>but they have a natural interest in the gym.</p>
<p>They just sometimes like to be out with daddy.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;ll come out there and, you know,</p>
<p>I, of the two of us, my wife and I will be the one</p>
<p>who has a little bit more of a longer leash</p>
<p>to let them explore things.</p>
<p>Cause I was a dummy at times too</p>
<p>and figured out best through the mistakes I made.</p>
<p>Through injury.</p>
<p>In neuroscience, we call that one trial learning.</p>
<p>There you go.</p>
<p>These guys are gonna be masters of one trial learning</p>
<p>because, you know, they&rsquo;ll go grab, you know,</p>
<p>the bars of my, the handles of my jammer that&rsquo;s there</p>
<p>cause it&rsquo;s at a lower level to them.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re swinging around.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re doing pull-ups on it naturally,</p>
<p>uncoached, nothing from me.</p>
<p>One will walk up to a deadlift bar,</p>
<p>stand over it naturally, never saw me do it.</p>
<p>Stands over there and just goes,</p>
<p>argh, you know, tries to pull it.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a, there&rsquo;s a definitely an inclination</p>
<p>to liking the gym and I will fully support that.</p>
<p>But of course, you know,</p>
<p>body weight will be good for quite a while.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So what age do you think is reasonable</p>
<p>for kids to start exploring a non-body weight training?</p>
<p>I think around 13, you know, I think around 13.</p>
<p>Once puberty, I think it&rsquo;s okay to start to, you know,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s so much,</p>
<p>I even say for people that are like later in age</p>
<p>who are just starting out,</p>
<p>learn with your own body weight first.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s plenty of resistance to be had</p>
<p>by learning how to command your body in space.</p>
<p>So if you have never trained before,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to get very stimulated by doing lunging</p>
<p>and reverse lunging,</p>
<p>even learning some of the proprioception</p>
<p>around movement through space, pull-ups, chin-ups,</p>
<p>pull-ups and chin-ups are challenging</p>
<p>for even people that have had 20, 30 years</p>
<p>of experience in the gym.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a lot of stimulus to be had by body weight</p>
<p>and jumping straight to dumbbells or barbells</p>
<p>is actually doing yourself a disservice.</p>
<p>You can learn better command of your body in space</p>
<p>so that when you go back to the bigger lifts,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to have an easier time</p>
<p>sort of progressively loading them</p>
<p>and building up that foundation of strength.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying that you have to become</p>
<p>a master calisthenics athlete</p>
<p>before you can touch a barbell.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not even true.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just saying there&rsquo;s so much capacity.</p>
<p>Kids are going to be doing this anyway.</p>
<p>And really just, if you look at general play,</p>
<p>they are jumping, they are lunging,</p>
<p>they are climbing, they are pulling.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s what they do.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know where the avoidance</p>
<p>of like structured training is for younger kids.</p>
<p>Again, provided they&rsquo;re using body weight</p>
<p>and maybe less ballistic movements or something like that,</p>
<p>things that are certainly overloaded movements.</p>
<p>I think we should encourage kids to do more.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of obesity in kids on the rise also.</p>
<p>And that is incredibly disconcerting to me.</p>
<p>So I think, and I hope it doesn&rsquo;t come</p>
<p>from the advice of some that say,</p>
<p>well, wait until you&rsquo;re older to start doing something.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s a way worse trade-off</p>
<p>than engaging in something smart now.</p>
<p>We used to get kicked out of the house when we were kids.</p>
<p>Totally.</p>
<p>My mom would kick us out.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, I had a huge pack of boys</p>
<p>that lived on my street, but we&rsquo;d get kicked outside.</p>
<p>Like literally, you&rsquo;re not allowed in, no television.</p>
<p>There were video games, of course,</p>
<p>but we were kicked out of the house.</p>
<p>We had to go play.</p>
<p>For us, it was skateboarding, soccer,</p>
<p>and then we&rsquo;d find our trouble.</p>
<p>But, so, post-training nutrition.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re the same age.</p>
<p>Years ago, I was sort of neurotic about the idea</p>
<p>that I had to ingest a certain amount of carbohydrates</p>
<p>and proteins within two hours.</p>
<p>Then it was 90 minutes of training.</p>
<p>I confess, I get, if I train hard,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m talking about the resistance training,</p>
<p>not the running, but the resistance training,</p>
<p>you know, 60 to 90 minutes later, I&rsquo;m really hungry.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;ve been days when I just skip</p>
<p>and then the hunger passes, and then later I eat more.</p>
<p>I might eat twice as much later.</p>
<p>You know, that&rsquo;s just the way sometimes schedules go.</p>
<p>But what are your thoughts in terms of the nutrition science,</p>
<p>the training-related effects of the post-training meal?</p>
<p>Is it something that you try to get?</p>
<p>Is it something that you think</p>
<p>people should pay attention to?</p>
<p>So, that science has actually probably been</p>
<p>the one that&rsquo;s changed the most in my lifetime, honestly,</p>
<p>because I, again, we&rsquo;re the same age,</p>
<p>and I was falling for the same trap,</p>
<p>you know, where I would really be focused on,</p>
<p>like, I&rsquo;m risking speeding tickets,</p>
<p>driving home from the gym to make sure</p>
<p>I got an anabolic window.</p>
<p>You know, like, I did all that.</p>
<p>I really did.</p>
<p>But thankfully, that&rsquo;s been sort of debunked,</p>
<p>and your body isn&rsquo;t just rushing through, you know,</p>
<p>these certain periods of time</p>
<p>to utilize the nutrients in our body,</p>
<p>but are able to partition them</p>
<p>and use them over a much greater duration.</p>
<p>Up to now, they&rsquo;re saying, you know,</p>
<p>three to four hours after training,</p>
<p>five hours after training,</p>
<p>you can still see the benefits of replenishment.</p>
<p>A lot of that is just, you know,</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a consistency element to it,</p>
<p>that just utilizing a post-workout window</p>
<p>or a post-workout meal,</p>
<p>even if it&rsquo;s within two hours or one hour,</p>
<p>is just integrating the habit of saying,</p>
<p>listen, I just did this activity,</p>
<p>and now I wanna replenish some of what I lost,</p>
<p>the energy that I used to perform,</p>
<p>you know, the exercises that I did.</p>
<p>And just getting into the routine,</p>
<p>knowing that the engine is ultimately fed</p>
<p>by what we put in it.</p>
<p>And the concept of replenishing the fuel lost</p>
<p>is still a concept that I think, again,</p>
<p>different in mechanism, but still important</p>
<p>in terms of fueling the overall performance.</p>
<p>So, you know, the pre-workout period of time</p>
<p>gives us a chance to actually have a longer window,</p>
<p>because if those nutrients are obtained pre-workout,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not like they&rsquo;re gone in that hour that you&rsquo;ve trained.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re still there and available for your body to use.</p>
<p>So, you know, I think it&rsquo;s important</p>
<p>to get one of the two, you know, right,</p>
<p>or at least make sure you&rsquo;re consistently</p>
<p>having one of the two,</p>
<p>or you might risk going through all these periods</p>
<p>of having no nutrition to support your efforts,</p>
<p>not only will your workouts potentially suffer</p>
<p>in terms of the output,</p>
<p>but then you&rsquo;re also not providing your body</p>
<p>any ability to capitalize on an opportunity to feed it</p>
<p>and refuel and recover.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not very dogmatic about what specifically</p>
<p>to eat pre or post, you know, workout,</p>
<p>but I do think you should have protein</p>
<p>surrounding your training,</p>
<p>whether that be ahead of time or after.</p>
<p>Protein can be a little bit hard to digest for some people.</p>
<p>So if you do that pre-workout</p>
<p>and then you&rsquo;re finding your workouts slogging</p>
<p>because you don&rsquo;t feel good,</p>
<p>then certainly you put that after your meal.</p>
<p>But this whole concept of the urgency of time</p>
<p>has thankfully been removed</p>
<p>and we can just learn to eat a little bit more,</p>
<p>you know, responsibly and drive more responsibly</p>
<p>so we&rsquo;re not, you know, trying to rush home from the gym</p>
<p>and risk, you know, killing people on the way.</p>
<p>You know, I think it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>but I think it&rsquo;s great because I think that</p>
<p>that was something that it just showcases a belief</p>
<p>that people had for so long</p>
<p>that has since been proven to be not that important.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a tip of the cap towards research in a good way</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s like, all right, I think we could all agree</p>
<p>that this isn&rsquo;t necessarily true anymore.</p>
<p>And look at yourself and say,</p>
<p>oh my God, I did that so often.</p>
<p>Like I bit that one hook, line and sinker,</p>
<p>but then realize, okay, we could always make a change.</p>
<p>And the good thing about nutrition is</p>
<p>those changes can happen the very next time you go to eat,</p>
<p>you know, and you&rsquo;ll start to see the benefits of that.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not a big believer in that strict approach</p>
<p>to pre or post workout.</p>
<p>I mean, even as far as pre-workout supplements,</p>
<p>a lot of people don&rsquo;t take them.</p>
<p>A lot of people don&rsquo;t like them.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t take them.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t like, they&rsquo;re not necessarily even being used</p>
<p>as the new nutritive side of the pre-workout.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just more used to fuel the workout.</p>
<p>Stim, for me, it&rsquo;s water and some form of caffeine.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, it&rsquo;s whatever, you know,</p>
<p>again, I think it&rsquo;s important.</p>
<p>I do think it&rsquo;s important to maintain a high level of output</p>
<p>so if your pre-workout nutrition requires a stimulant</p>
<p>in order to help you do that,</p>
<p>or if your pre-workout nutrition is causing you</p>
<p>to have a harder time to train</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re feeling full or stomachache</p>
<p>or something else, then that&rsquo;s not achieving</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re trying to do.</p>
<p>The ultimate goal is to still be able to perform</p>
<p>at the highest level.</p>
<p>So whatever your nutrition is required</p>
<p>to allow you to still do that,</p>
<p>that is probably the most important factor of all of it.</p>
<p>Great, I love the very clear and rational approach.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t ingest anything right before your workout</p>
<p>or near your workout that&rsquo;s going to make</p>
<p>your workout worse.</p>
<p>Oh, I mean, even if you-</p>
<p>Yeah, and it&rsquo;s so simple and yet you don&rsquo;t hear this</p>
<p>because I think people will think,</p>
<p>oh, they must have a pre-workout.</p>
<p>They must have a post-workout.</p>
<p>No, I mean, again, like even if there are,</p>
<p>the benefits that are to be had</p>
<p>from whatever&rsquo;s being suggested</p>
<p>is gonna be easily offset by the fact</p>
<p>that you can&rsquo;t perform at an output</p>
<p>capable of driving any change.</p>
<p>So that would pretty much negate the fact</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re not outweighing those benefits</p>
<p>of whatever nutritive approach you took</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s struggling through your workout.</p>
<p>Yeah, for me, the best pre-workout is a good night&rsquo;s sleep,</p>
<p>hydration, caffeine, music.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, there you go.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s a pretty simple formula, you know?</p>
<p>It works.</p>
<p>And then post-workout, I do find I get quite hungry</p>
<p>and want to eat quite a bit more.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s a natural response.</p>
<p>The body&rsquo;s going to, and most people want to do that.</p>
<p>And I think it should be fed.</p>
<p>I work out as, you know, again,</p>
<p>a lot of my postings on Instagram will happen</p>
<p>at 10 o&rsquo;clock at night, 10.30 at night, 11 at night,</p>
<p>because I am actually training there.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where I&rsquo;m taking those little breaks</p>
<p>in between sets to actually film or post something.</p>
<p>But like, I then go inside, I eat dinner.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m eating at 11 o&rsquo;clock at night, you know?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not necessarily ideal.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not recommending that as a tool for anybody.</p>
<p>I think it dispels one thing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never been a believer in can&rsquo;t eat carbs after six.</p>
<p>That makes no sense to me.</p>
<p>Based on all the new, all the science of metabolism</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve seen, makes no sense.</p>
<p>I think as long as you can, sort of like napping.</p>
<p>I talked to Matt Walker, one of the great sleep researchers,</p>
<p>wrote Why We Sleep, et cetera, you know,</p>
<p>and has his own podcast about sleep.</p>
<p>Tremendous researcher, public communicator about sleep.</p>
<p>And he said, you know, naps are fine,</p>
<p>provided they don&rsquo;t interrupt your ability</p>
<p>to sleep well at night.</p>
<p>Simple.</p>
<p>Some people can sleep from eight to 9 p.m.</p>
<p>and then go to bed at midnight and not a problem.</p>
<p>Other people, they take a 30 minute nap after lunch</p>
<p>and they can&rsquo;t sleep at night.</p>
<p>Caffeine&rsquo;s a little different because Matt would argue</p>
<p>the architecture of sleep can be disrupted, et cetera.</p>
<p>But if you can eat dinner late and eat carbohydrates late,</p>
<p>I actually need carbohydrates at night</p>
<p>in order to be able to sleep.</p>
<p>Whenever I&rsquo;ve done a low-carbohydrate type regimen</p>
<p>in the evening, I have a hard time falling asleep.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just too alert.</p>
<p>And so I eat carbohydrates in the evening</p>
<p>to restore glycogen, but also in order to make sure</p>
<p>that I can fall asleep.</p>
<p>I actually can, again, obviously it&rsquo;s already late at night</p>
<p>by the time I&rsquo;m done eating,</p>
<p>but I can fall asleep within five, 10 minutes</p>
<p>of finishing my meal because I do think</p>
<p>that they have that same effect on me.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m not bothered by the feeling of fullness.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not unable to sleep because of a feeling of fullness.</p>
<p>But I do like the fact that I feel as if I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>at least replenishing what was lost through my hard training</p>
<p>and I do like to back it up with a dinner.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t need to eat smaller amounts.</p>
<p>Some people can&rsquo;t have that much.</p>
<p>I will say after a hard leg workout,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have the same appetite that I do</p>
<p>after, let&rsquo;s say, an upper body workout.</p>
<p>It can really disrupt my whole feeling of wellbeing.</p>
<p>You wanna eat less after you train your legs?</p>
<p>I do, yeah.</p>
<p>Oh, wow, I&rsquo;m the opposite.</p>
<p>No, because I just feel like I could feel sick</p>
<p>to my stomach.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re clearly training harder.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen the way you train.</p>
<p>You do train very intensely.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think it&rsquo;s important.</p>
<p>I mean, I think that, again, it&rsquo;s that trade off</p>
<p>between if you&rsquo;re not gonna train for a long period of time,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re gonna wanna train harder.</p>
<p>And again, I actually feel like contrary</p>
<p>to what people might think as you age,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re better off training harder</p>
<p>for a shorter period of time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always within the realm of safe training.</p>
<p>I mean, I think that&rsquo;s what I like to think.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I bring to the table,</p>
<p>like an approach that&rsquo;s smarter so I can train harder,</p>
<p>like not doing the dumb things I did when I was a kid.</p>
<p>And with that trade off being a harder trainer,</p>
<p>I think I get the results that I want</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m able to really push it and then back off.</p>
<p>And again, the meal feels like almost a physiological reward</p>
<p>for the hard effort I put in the gym,</p>
<p>knowing that I&rsquo;m also replenishing and setting the stage</p>
<p>for the next day to be another successful day of training,</p>
<p>or maybe not, depending on how many times a week I train.</p>
<p>But yeah, I think that it&rsquo;s a lot less,</p>
<p>I hate to say it, but it&rsquo;s a lot less scientific</p>
<p>than we wanna make it.</p>
<p>And as it seems to be coming back oftentimes,</p>
<p>like the thing that works for you</p>
<p>is really the most important thing</p>
<p>because ultimately getting your ass in there</p>
<p>and doing what you do is really the thing</p>
<p>that provides the best benefit.</p>
<p>Absolutely, and there are many things</p>
<p>that I would say are hallmarks of Jeff Cavaliere,</p>
<p>but one of them is certainly consistency.</p>
<p>You make it happen one way or another.</p>
<p>Huge, I mean, consistency really is the determinant.</p>
<p>And I know that that is the hardest part for people</p>
<p>and why people tend to look for the shortcut</p>
<p>because consistency is the part</p>
<p>that becomes the biggest challenge.</p>
<p>But if you could find, listen, if you could find the,</p>
<p>I mean, through what I&rsquo;ve been trying to encourage here</p>
<p>is like if you could find the nutrition approach,</p>
<p>if you could find the training approach,</p>
<p>if you could find the training split,</p>
<p>if you could try all those things</p>
<p>that encourage you to wanna go to the gym,</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;re locked in at the point</p>
<p>where you said you actually look forward</p>
<p>to going and doing your workout.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>I look forward to, I mean, it&rsquo;s, you know,</p>
<p>actually this morning, one of our teammates</p>
<p>for the podcast, I got a workout and halfway through,</p>
<p>I just turned to him and I said,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll never figure out why that feels so good,</p>
<p>but it feels so good.</p>
<p>I just, I really enjoy it and it lets,</p>
<p>and I love to eat and it lets me eat</p>
<p>and I love the way it makes me feel afterward.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t understand this concept of not enjoying the gym.</p>
<p>Cardio is a little different.</p>
<p>I always loathe the first 10 or 20 minutes of a jog.</p>
<p>I mildly loathe the middle third and by the end,</p>
<p>I think this is the greatest thing ever.</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t I do it all the time?</p>
<p>And then that feeling evaporates</p>
<p>before the next time I do it.</p>
<p>Yeah, of course, you don&rsquo;t even remember it either.</p>
<p>The next time you get on, you hate it again.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think if people could,</p>
<p>if we had one gift we could give to everybody,</p>
<p>it would be the love of fitness, right?</p>
<p>If they could be bestowed the love of fitness,</p>
<p>it would change the entire world, you know?</p>
<p>But I think when you hear things like this,</p>
<p>that like, hey, that will work and that will work too</p>
<p>and that this will work too, you know,</p>
<p>rather than the dogmatic one way only approach,</p>
<p>which could become discouraging for people.</p>
<p>Then I think it becomes a little bit uplifting.</p>
<p>Like, well, I&rsquo;ve never tried that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve actually never tried a total body split</p>
<p>or I&rsquo;ve never tried, you know, that style of eating.</p>
<p>Like, it becomes encouraging that you might wanna explore</p>
<p>and then you might finally get locked in</p>
<p>and say, I really liked this</p>
<p>and then you&rsquo;re off and running.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s what I so enjoy about your content.</p>
<p>We would be remiss if we didn&rsquo;t briefly discuss Jesse.</p>
<p>One of the great pleasures for me in watching your content</p>
<p>and learning from it over the years</p>
<p>is that you took on, you decided to mentor somebody, Jesse,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s some poking fun back and forth</p>
<p>between the two of you, which is very amusing,</p>
<p>but I have to say it inspired me to do something early on</p>
<p>in developing this podcast as I have a young intern</p>
<p>who has helped me with some of the research</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s interested in science.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s about to go off to college,</p>
<p>but he also got really into fitness.</p>
<p>We would watch the videos of you guys.</p>
<p>He was helping me get the Instagram content out early on.</p>
<p>And one thing that was just, it&rsquo;s such a pleasure</p>
<p>to be able to pass along knowledge.</p>
<p>And of course, I&rsquo;m learning from him.</p>
<p>This is always the way it works.</p>
<p>We learn from teaching and we learn from students.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s been great to see Jesse&rsquo;s progress.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve gotten to meet him in person just now</p>
<p>and he has grown, he&rsquo;s changed physically.</p>
<p>And I think that you mentioned a love of fitness.</p>
<p>I think that one of the best ways to be consistent</p>
<p>is to take on the responsibility of teaching others</p>
<p>once one has proficiency in something.</p>
<p>So maybe you just tell us a little bit</p>
<p>about how that&rsquo;s going.</p>
<p>How is Jesse doing and where does he need a little more work?</p>
<p>Where is he thriving?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m impressed by the progress.</p>
<p>Well, we have, I mean, physically,</p>
<p>we can obviously see the changes.</p>
<p>The list of things to work on is immense.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so long for him to continue to improve.</p>
<p>No, actually, in reality,</p>
<p>the story of Jesse was that I knew Jesse</p>
<p>prior to starting even ATHLEANX.</p>
<p>And as a matter of fact, I think the funny thing</p>
<p>is the very first video that was ever posted on my channel</p>
<p>was a video that he shot as, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>a 13-year-old or something.</p>
<p>And I said, can you just film this for a second?</p>
<p>I was over there training members of the family.</p>
<p>So he then went off to college, went into film,</p>
<p>realized he had much greener pastures at ATHLEANX</p>
<p>instead of becoming the next Scorsese or something,</p>
<p>and he decided to come work with me.</p>
<p>And the expectations in the beginning</p>
<p>were just to edit videos or just to help</p>
<p>with various aspects of my day-to-day</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t think I was equipped to really handle</p>
<p>and grow the business anymore.</p>
<p>So then, look, by virtue of being in that environment,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an interest.</p>
<p>I think if I worked in a gym,</p>
<p>I might become interested in working out.</p>
<p>And though mine is not a commercial gym,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s sitting right behind my office window,</p>
<p>there became an interest in wanting</p>
<p>to work out a little bit.</p>
<p>And it wasn&rsquo;t even an intentional experiment</p>
<p>to put Jesse there.</p>
<p>I just thought that he&rsquo;s a very likable person.</p>
<p>He has a very funny personality.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s also the everyman.</p>
<p>In some ways, as I&rsquo;m sure maybe you experience sometimes,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m the guy that this comes naturally for me,</p>
<p>is what people will say.</p>
<p>This is what you do for a living.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an element of disconnect</p>
<p>in terms of the relatability</p>
<p>because I do do this for a living.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t deny that.</p>
<p>I do work with professional athletes.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a level of interest in this above and beyond.</p>
<p>But for him, he&rsquo;s just the kid who wants to train</p>
<p>maybe if he rolls out of bed before 11 a.m.</p>
<p>and doesn&rsquo;t have a date on Friday night.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s the guy everybody can relate to.</p>
<p>And watching him transform,</p>
<p>and I love the fact that even the interest level</p>
<p>was up and down.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t consistent for him</p>
<p>because he was part interested</p>
<p>and then maybe not interested for three months,</p>
<p>and then interested and not.</p>
<p>And I never pushed it on him.</p>
<p>Again, this was no orchestrated experiment for me.</p>
<p>It was just like, if you wanna do this, then do this.</p>
<p>And also from a standpoint of lending my help</p>
<p>or expertise to him, like I said with my son,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not gonna force it on anybody.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna do that to anybody.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that that&rsquo;s ever gonna spark that desire</p>
<p>for long-term adoption.</p>
<p>He got more interested.</p>
<p>He started to learn more about it.</p>
<p>He watches the videos that we&rsquo;re filming.</p>
<p>He films the videos that we&rsquo;re filming.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s learning through what I&rsquo;m saying.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s becoming more of a student of the field.</p>
<p>And I have to say, his knowledge in the field has grown</p>
<p>with the growth of his physique.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s put into practice some of the things that I say.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s put in practice some things he hears other places.</p>
<p>And he winds up improving as he goes.</p>
<p>And he winds up starting to love this</p>
<p>like he never thought he would.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s great to see anybody grow.</p>
<p>And whether that be physically or that be emotionally</p>
<p>or whether it be just in their career,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s great to see somebody grow.</p>
<p>And I like to tease him, funny admission here.</p>
<p>There are times when the jabs that I will throw at him</p>
<p>are something that we might know ahead of time</p>
<p>of what I&rsquo;m going to say to him.</p>
<p>People will say, you&rsquo;re so mean to him.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t believe it, that&rsquo;s so abusive.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, dude, honestly, we laugh after it&rsquo;s over.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s good, we&rsquo;re good.</p>
<p>So, of course, but like, but there&rsquo;s-</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s tougher than he looks is what you&rsquo;re saying.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s tougher than he looks, believe me.</p>
<p>And he looks pretty tough now, he&rsquo;s got the big beard.</p>
<p>He looks more manly than I do.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t grow a beard, I don&rsquo;t, yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, believe me, he&rsquo;s totally alpha.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, quickly becoming the second star of this show.</p>
<p>But like, he&rsquo;s definitely contributed</p>
<p>and people enjoy his presence for sure.</p>
<p>Yeah, I certainly do.</p>
<p>And I think that, as you pointed out,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a kind of a proxy and a template for everybody.</p>
<p>We can relate to him because even though I&rsquo;ve trained</p>
<p>for many years, it&rsquo;s been a struggle</p>
<p>through graduate school, postdoc,</p>
<p>made it happen one way or another,</p>
<p>but with more or less attention and admittedly</p>
<p>through waxing, waning levels of motivation,</p>
<p>although I&rsquo;m fortunate that I do enjoy it.</p>
<p>What I think is nice about it too</p>
<p>is that it&rsquo;s a realistic expectation that we set, I think.</p>
<p>In other words, you&rsquo;re showcasing</p>
<p>what the journey actually looks like.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s been on the journey for, again,</p>
<p>devotedly for, let&rsquo;s say, the last year and a half,</p>
<p>but on the journey for five years.</p>
<p>If I could make the gains that he did,</p>
<p>starting when I started training at 14, 15,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re saying, hey, by 20,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna have the strength levels he does,</p>
<p>the physique that he does,</p>
<p>the knowledge that you&rsquo;ve gained,</p>
<p>that seems like a blink of an eye now looking back.</p>
<p>At 46 years old, I&rsquo;m like, holy cow,</p>
<p>I think it took me 20 years, 15, 20 years,</p>
<p>so to just even start to get into a groove.</p>
<p>For him to do it in a period of five years,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t seem long, whereas there&rsquo;s people</p>
<p>that will criticize his journey,</p>
<p>like, oh, it&rsquo;s taking so long.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s such an instant gratification that people seek.</p>
<p>Luckily, that&rsquo;s the minority.</p>
<p>Most people are like, this is amazing.</p>
<p>But I think that it becomes very uplifting</p>
<p>because not only is it relatable,</p>
<p>but the journey is real, and people can appreciate that.</p>
<p>This is what will happen if you actually put in</p>
<p>consistent hard work, and you&rsquo;ll watch him transform.</p>
<p>Go back and watch the videos.</p>
<p>We like to oftentimes throw back to videos</p>
<p>where he appeared as smaller Jesse, but also shy Jesse,</p>
<p>arms crossed, head down,</p>
<p>not making eye contact with the camera,</p>
<p>to where now he&rsquo;s got his own skits and intros.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s funny because the confidence,</p>
<p>with the growth of physique came confidence, too,</p>
<p>which is great.</p>
<p>Absolutely, it&rsquo;s pretty soon it&rsquo;ll be his world,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll all be living in it, as they say.</p>
<p>Well, on behalf of myself and all the listeners,</p>
<p>I really want to thank you, first of all,</p>
<p>for the discussion today.</p>
<p>I learned an immense amount.</p>
<p>Even though I thought I knew your content well,</p>
<p>I still learned an immense amount.</p>
<p>Many things we could deploy, from when to stretch,</p>
<p>how to stretch, the skipping rope.</p>
<p>We talked about nutrition.</p>
<p>We talked about heat, cold, training regimens.</p>
<p>And what I love about all of this,</p>
<p>now that you&rsquo;ve given us, is that there&rsquo;s a backbone</p>
<p>of logic, and some consistent themes,</p>
<p>indeed, about consistency.</p>
<p>But the logical backbone, I think, is what will enable</p>
<p>people to really show up to the table and stay there</p>
<p>for training consistently over time.</p>
<p>As you said, the gift of fitness is an immense gift.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t thank you enough.</p>
<p>I know you&rsquo;re an incredibly busy human being</p>
<p>with kids, and dogs, and a marriage,</p>
<p>and a thriving business.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my pleasure.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m happy I was able to make it work,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ve been watching your stuff for a while,</p>
<p>and I love the science of it.</p>
<p>I like the way you think.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m just really fortunate that I was able to do it.</p>
<p>Well, I feel very gratified in hearing that,</p>
<p>and honored to have you here.</p>
<p>So, thank you so much.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Thank you for joining me for my discussion</p>
<p>with Jeff Cavaliere.</p>
