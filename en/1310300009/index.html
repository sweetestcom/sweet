    <p>This is an All Ears English bonus episode.</p>
<p>Was your invitation rejected?</p>
<p>How to respond in English.</p>
<p>Welcome to the All Ears English podcast, downloaded more than 200 million times.</p>
<p>Are you feeling stuck with your English?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll show you how to become fearless and fluent by focusing on connection, not perfection.</p>
<p>With your American hosts, Lindsay McMahon, the English adventurer, and Michelle Kaplan,</p>
<p>the New York radio girl, coming to you from Colorado and New York City, USA.</p>
<p>When you invite a colleague out after work and they reject your invitation, what can</p>
<p>you say to still maintain the connection?</p>
<p>Find out in this special episode.</p>
<p>Hey, Lindsay, how are you today?</p>
<p>Hi, Aubrey.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m happy to be on the mic with you.</p>
<p>How&rsquo;s it going?</p>
<p>Yes, I am great.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m very excited for this special episode.</p>
<p>Every now and then we get to share with you guys a really good conversation from the Business</p>
<p>English podcast.</p>
<p>And this, what you&rsquo;re going to hear today is so vital.</p>
<p>Such a vital skill.</p>
<p>Oh my gosh.</p>
<p>I know a lot of our listeners really want to improve that social communication side</p>
<p>of business, right?</p>
<p>Because business is not just people.</p>
<p>We are human beings doing business with each other.</p>
<p>We need to be able to socialize with our colleagues, right?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why we created our other business, our new Business English podcast, right, Aubrey?</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re not following it yet, absolutely search All Ears English wherever you find</p>
<p>your podcasts.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll see all three of our podcasts and be sure to follow the Business English podcast</p>
<p>as well.</p>
<p>These episodes are curated for you guys, very much focused on how we talk at work, how to</p>
<p>improve business English.</p>
<p>And today you&rsquo;re going to hear one of those.</p>
<p>This is all about when you invite a colleague out, you&rsquo;re taking a chance, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a chance they might say no.</p>
<p>Maybe they&rsquo;re not free or they don&rsquo;t want to go.</p>
<p>And if that&rsquo;s the case, the way in which you respond is so crucial.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s funny.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a big risk even in your social life outside of business asking someone, hey, do you want</p>
<p>to hang out, right?</p>
<p>Not even romantically, just a new friend.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a risk as an adult, right?</p>
<p>And we fear rejection as human beings.</p>
<p>But in business, it&rsquo;s even riskier because not only could we lose if they say no, we</p>
<p>lose face, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s kind of a little bit of that piece.</p>
<p>But there are things that we can say that could maintain that connection, right, Aubrey?</p>
<p>Exactly, right.</p>
<p>To keep the professional relationship, that connection, no matter what.</p>
<p>So today we&rsquo;re going to share this conversation from the Business English Podcast, and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to learn exactly what you should say if someone rejects an invitation, if someone</p>
<p>turns you down.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s go ahead and hear the episode.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for the end.</p>
<p>Lindsay and I will share our favorite phrase from the episode.</p>
<p>All right, let&rsquo;s go ahead and listen.</p>
<p>Hey, Michelle.</p>
<p>So hey, I&rsquo;m going to be in New York at the end of the month for a conference.</p>
<p>Can we get together for a coffee on the 25th at noon?</p>
<p>Ooh, Lindsay, I don&rsquo;t think I can make it that weekend.</p>
<p>Oh, okay.</p>
<p>No problem.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll do it another time.</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s too bad.</p>
<p>Oh, you turned me down.</p>
<p>Ouch.</p>
<p>Michelle.</p>
<p>Jeez.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Well, well, today, guys, what are we talking about?</p>
<p>Michelle, what are we going to go into today?</p>
<p>I mean, sometimes we want to extend an invitation to someone, and what happens?</p>
<p>They say no.</p>
<p>They say no.</p>
<p>And the question is, what do we say next, right?</p>
<p>You say, how could you?</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m just joking.</p>
<p>Yeah, you&rsquo;ve got to be graceful about it, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, you&rsquo;ve got to be graceful.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s also not just to be graceful, also to learn something about the person and whether</p>
<p>they, like, what are their ideas about hanging out with you in the future, right?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s actually a very useful step here in English that we need to know how to do.</p>
<p>I mean, Michelle, in your social life or professional life, like, how do you usually handle these</p>
<p>situations?</p>
<p>If somebody says that they can&rsquo;t do something?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Like, what would you normally say?</p>
<p>Just to give a real, like‚Ä¶</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d probably say, like, oh, that&rsquo;s too bad.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Next time.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Something like that.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Next time is a very common thing to say, right?</p>
<p>Uh-huh.</p>
<p>Uh-huh.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So what does that mean?</p>
<p>Oh, that means, like, that you kind of put yourself ‚Äì well, not to use another phrase,</p>
<p>but put yourself out there.</p>
<p>Like, you kind of ‚Äì in a way, like, in a way, when you ask someone to hang out with</p>
<p>you, you&rsquo;re, like, kind of vulnerable.</p>
<p>It depends on your relationship.</p>
<p>But, like‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>Well, especially in the dating world, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s especially true.</p>
<p>Oh, my gosh.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Big time.</p>
<p>But, you know, but in general, you are ‚Äì you&rsquo;re sticking your neck out.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not going to take a chance.</p>
<p>Okay?</p>
<p>Another thing was Stick, right?</p>
<p>We did an episode about Stick last week.</p>
<p>Oh, we did.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And we didn&rsquo;t come up with that one, did we?</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s so many more we could do with Stick.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll do it another day.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll come back to it, I&rsquo;m sure.</p>
<p>And guys, yeah, the cool thing is we&rsquo;re doing a lot of episodes on this, you know,</p>
<p>how to bring the workspace into the social space, like how to invite your colleagues</p>
<p>out to work.</p>
<p>We did that episode.</p>
<p>That was episode 701.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re going to want to review that one first and then come back to this one.</p>
<p>Okay?</p>
<p>So go to allearsenglish.com, type in 701.</p>
<p>And this is actually a question from a listener.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s see, Michelle, would you read the question?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s quite short, actually, and basic, but that&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>Straight to the point.</p>
<p>Wait, which one is ‚Äì where does the listener email?</p>
<p>So Eve.</p>
<p>Eve is the listener here, and she says ‚Äì well, I&rsquo;ll just read it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very short.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t see it for some reason.</p>
<p>Oh, maybe it didn&rsquo;t copy into the email.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>So it says, what to say when you ‚Äì</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t see it.</p>
<p>Sorry.</p>
<p>Go ahead.</p>
<p>So Eve just asked us the question, right?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So exactly what we&rsquo;re answering.</p>
<p>She said ‚Äì or he, rather, said, what should I say when I invite someone out who&rsquo;s a colleague</p>
<p>and they turn me down?</p>
<p>Okay?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just the question.</p>
<p>All right?</p>
<p>So Michelle, what would you say first here?</p>
<p>Well, it really depends on the relationship, right?</p>
<p>So is this like, I mean, a romantic interest or a colleague, like Eve said?</p>
<p>I mean, or, I mean, who knows?</p>
<p>It could be both.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>So, you know, it&rsquo;s going to be different depending on who is actually asking you to hang out.</p>
<p>But today we&rsquo;re going to assume that it&rsquo;s a colleague, okay?</p>
<p>And we can do a different episode on a romantic interest or a friend.</p>
<p>You know, we can go into all these niche topics later.</p>
<p>And but if you do want one of those situations, guys, you should write a comment in the blog</p>
<p>post for this episode and tell us what you want, okay?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s two reasons to say something when they turn you down, right?</p>
<p>What are the two reasons for that, Michelle?</p>
<p>Of trying to say something when somebody turns you down?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Like instead of just walking away or kind of like saying nothing.</p>
<p>I mean.</p>
<p>I mean, yeah, you don&rsquo;t want to just, I mean, you&rsquo;re trying to maintain the connection,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So, you know, sometimes you&rsquo;re just like putting out feelers to figure out if they actually</p>
<p>want to go out, but they&rsquo;re really just busy or if they don&rsquo;t want to hang out and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>just making an excuse, right?</p>
<p>And so like, basically, it&rsquo;s you&rsquo;re going to be able to tell based on how they react</p>
<p>to whatever comment you make, right?</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why we say those are really the two reasons for like being strategic here,</p>
<p>guys, about your comment.</p>
<p>Number one is making maintaining the connection.</p>
<p>Number two is putting out feelers to see what they want to do, okay?</p>
<p>So I think this applies a little bit more in the dating world because you definitely</p>
<p>want to know, like, what are someone&rsquo;s ideas on going out with you, okay?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s where it would be even more important.</p>
<p>But, you know, we&rsquo;re talking about connection here.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So what are some things that we can say then, Michelle?</p>
<p>When someone turns it down?</p>
<p>Well, first, I mean, really, you could just say, oh, that&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>Maybe we can do it another time or maybe we can do it some other time.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>And so if they really want to hang out, they might suggest another time right here.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And this is something to look out for more in the dating world, right?</p>
<p>But what should we be aware of?</p>
<p>Well, if you hear the word sometime without anything specific, right, like, oh, yeah,</p>
<p>maybe sometime.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not a great sign.</p>
<p>Maybe sometime.</p>
<p>Oh, ouch.</p>
<p>Ouch.</p>
<p>Ouch.</p>
<p>Especially in American culture.</p>
<p>We talked a few weeks ago about, you know, is the invitation real?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an episode we did a long time ago.</p>
<p>You can come back to AllEarsEnglish.com, type in, is the invitation real?</p>
<p>But when you&rsquo;re talking to American people, often they&rsquo;re not going to say to your face,</p>
<p>no, I don&rsquo;t want to spend any time with you.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>No, I don&rsquo;t want to.</p>
<p>Sorry.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to just go around.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to be very general.</p>
<p>And something they might use is, yeah, maybe sometime.</p>
<p>I remember there was an episode of Friends.</p>
<p>Who knows?</p>
<p>Maybe I spoke about this once.</p>
<p>Do you want to hear?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, I do, actually.</p>
<p>Well, it was one of the early ones.</p>
<p>And they were like, I think I did say this once, but it just cracks me up.</p>
<p>The group is like, I think Ross is moving, and he says to Phoebe, are you going to help</p>
<p>come over and help me move tonight?</p>
<p>And she goes, oh, I wish I could, but I don&rsquo;t want to.</p>
<p>And like, it&rsquo;s just so funny, because the reason it&rsquo;s funny is it&rsquo;s just like so direct,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>Like, nobody would actually say that.</p>
<p>But she&rsquo;s actually just saying the exact reason, like, oh, I wish I could, but I don&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>to.</p>
<p>I love that, because it really kind of right there, it kind of defines what comedy is,</p>
<p>what good comedy is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s voicing what we all are thinking, but we&rsquo;re too afraid to say, like, that is comedy</p>
<p>right there.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So we wouldn&rsquo;t actually say that.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know anyone who would actually say that.</p>
<p>Who knows?</p>
<p>But exactly.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Most people would say, I wish I could, but I have to, you know, I have to study or I</p>
<p>have to do this.</p>
<p>I have to do that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s so funny.</p>
<p>Oh, I love Friends.</p>
<p>Phoebe&rsquo;s my favorite character.</p>
<p>Love her.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the big thing there.</p>
<p>Watch out for, yeah, maybe sometime or, yeah, maybe.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s even worse.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Maybe.</p>
<p>I mean, maybe it&rsquo;s basically a no, I think.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>In many ways.</p>
<p>It depends on the relationship.</p>
<p>But OK, let&rsquo;s move on to number two.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s another thing you could say if the person says they can&rsquo;t hang out with you when</p>
<p>you ask them to?</p>
<p>You can just say, no problem.</p>
<p>I just thought I&rsquo;d throw it out there.</p>
<p>Hopefully at some point we can make that happen.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Now, that sounds a little bit more like assertive and more work-like, a little more professional</p>
<p>to me.</p>
<p>Yeah, I agree.</p>
<p>I think if I heard this socially, I would think it was like a little weird.</p>
<p>A little bit like trying a little too hard.</p>
<p>Would you agree?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Very much so.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>Subtleties in the language.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s incredible.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t that interesting?</p>
<p>Although I do have a friend.</p>
<p>Well, she&rsquo;s not exactly a great friend anymore because sometimes she was a little too assertive</p>
<p>in the friendship world.</p>
<p>She would take phrases that were more relative to the work world and she would kind of use</p>
<p>them in the friendship world.</p>
<p>It was kind of strange.</p>
<p>So she would say something like that.</p>
<p>Hopefully at some point we can make that happen.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s a little bit weird, right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And then the last one we could say is, okay, well, good luck with the thing they have to</p>
<p>do.</p>
<p>Like good luck with your class or good luck with studying or good luck with whatever it</p>
<p>is.</p>
<p>I will see you in the office or I&rsquo;ll talk to you at work.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Perfect.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And that one&rsquo;s kind of good because once you&rsquo;ve invited someone out, one approach that you</p>
<p>could do is you could hang back and wait for them to invite you out next time.</p>
<p>Just let it go completely.</p>
<p>And then if they invite you to do something, then you know that they&rsquo;re reciprocating,</p>
<p>that they want to hang out.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s do a role play, Michelle.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll try out some of these.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Here we go.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>So here we are.</p>
<p>We are two colleagues.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Cool.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Here we go.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Hey, Lindsey.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been working hard this week.</p>
<p>How about we grab a drink after work on Friday?</p>
<p>Oh, Michelle, I&rsquo;d like to, but I have early dinner plans.</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>I just thought I&rsquo;d throw that out there.</p>
<p>Maybe we can do it some other time.</p>
<p>Oh, speaking of that, are you free this coming Wednesday after work?</p>
<p>We could swing by that new cocktail bar near work.</p>
<p>Yeah, that sounds great.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s plan on it.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Cool.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So actually, in this role play, guys, we forgot to tell you, we&rsquo;re going to do two endings.</p>
<p>Two.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a two-for-one.</p>
<p>Two-for-one.</p>
<p>You get a two-for-one discount.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to do ending one, where the person actually does want to hang out, so the person</p>
<p>has a counter offer, right?</p>
<p>The person, like I, suggested another time, and that&rsquo;s a great sign, right?</p>
<p>But then we&rsquo;re going to do also ending two, where I&rsquo;m going to react differently, okay?</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s try it again.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Here we go.</p>
<p>Hey, Lindsey.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been working hard this week.</p>
<p>How about we grab a drink after work on Friday?</p>
<p>Oh, Michelle, I&rsquo;d like to, but I have early dinner plans.</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>I just thought I&rsquo;d throw that out there.</p>
<p>Maybe we can do it some other time.</p>
<p>Uh, yeah.</p>
<p>Maybe sometime.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>You weren&rsquo;t even trying to hide it.</p>
<p>I gave you the, yeah, maybe sometime.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And like the, uh.</p>
<p>Like, like.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s funny.</p>
<p>Burn.</p>
<p>That was painful.</p>
<p>Oh, don&rsquo;t take it personally.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all right.</p>
<p>So sad.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>So what we taught today, we can see it in this role play, right?</p>
<p>So again, as we talked about, guys, you should try to say something so you can get a response</p>
<p>from the other person so you can feel out what they, what they want.</p>
<p>And in this case, the first situation, I give a counter offer.</p>
<p>I give another suggestion.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And in the second one, what happened, Michelle?</p>
<p>You just said, uh, yeah, maybe sometime.</p>
<p>I mean, sometimes, I mean, it may not be that obvious, like with their intonation, because</p>
<p>they may try to be, be trying to hide it.</p>
<p>Like maybe they&rsquo;d say like, yeah, maybe sometime.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I think I was a little too obvious.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>Um, no, but I mean, it could happen like that.</p>
<p>It could happen either way.</p>
<p>But yeah.</p>
<p>So don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>If somebody says, oh, yeah, maybe sometime.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s still bad.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>So don&rsquo;t be fooled.</p>
<p>I mean, we tell, we talk about a lot of the show that intonation is so important, but</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the thing here that don&rsquo;t be fooled by the intonation.</p>
<p>In this case, it&rsquo;s really the words they&rsquo;re using.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s so sad, because I mean, I, you know, I don&rsquo;t want people to think that, like,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>This makes me think of I&rsquo;ve heard people say like that they think Americans are like a</p>
<p>little fake.</p>
<p>Fake.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And so that I mean, I guess in that way, when we say that, like, that part is, I could understand</p>
<p>why someone would say that when we&rsquo;re talking about this topic, right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Actually, I bet we I wonder if we&rsquo;ve done an episode on this, you know, are Americans</p>
<p>fake?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a big topic.</p>
<p>And I struggle with that, too, because in some ways, in some like very superficial ways,</p>
<p>we are like this example.</p>
<p>But in other ways, we&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>I mean, right.</p>
<p>Those are all different.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And actually, yeah, when I just when we did this exact like thing, it just made me think</p>
<p>about, you know, when people say that, and like, in that certain way, I guess it&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s also this idea of just wanting to be polite.</p>
<p>So anyway, but we&rsquo;ll get we&rsquo;ll get it to another time.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure that there is an answer, because the problem is like when people ask that question,</p>
<p>are Americans fake?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re always going to be interpreting it through our own cultural lens.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re someone in Russia who&rsquo;s saying are Americans fake?</p>
<p>You might be saying yes, because you are talking through your cultural lens, your cultural</p>
<p>way of seeing the world.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not talking objectively like we&rsquo;re never objective.</p>
<p>No one is objective.</p>
<p>OK.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s the interesting part.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s a fascinating topic.</p>
<p>Michelle, I&rsquo;m glad you brought that up, actually.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Really interesting.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>OK.</p>
<p>So what do we want to remember today, Michelle?</p>
<p>Well, you know, don&rsquo;t be afraid to invite your colleagues out.</p>
<p>So review, we said Episode 701, learn those phrases, learn these ones and just go make</p>
<p>some plans.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>And don&rsquo;t don&rsquo;t don&rsquo;t be afraid.</p>
<p>It is important to respond to if it&rsquo;s a so-called rejection, right?</p>
<p>Respond to that to put out feelers to figure out if you should try inviting the person</p>
<p>out again.</p>
<p>They want to know where you stand.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Or again, as we showed you in this too, you could always just wait for them to invite</p>
<p>you out once you&rsquo;ve invited them out.</p>
<p>It should be reciprocal.</p>
<p>So they should invite you out, OK?</p>
<p>So you can take your pick.</p>
<p>But good episode, good social skills, social work skills episode.</p>
<p>And yeah, comes down to connection, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to build that connection.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Yeah, for sure.</p>
<p>For sure.</p>
<p>Awesome.</p>
<p>Well, this is great.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Very good.</p>

<p>Very cool.</p>
<p>OK, Michelle.</p>
<p>This has been fun.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll see you soon.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>See you.</p>
<p>Bye.</p>
<p>Take care.</p>
<p>Bye.</p>
<p>What a great episode.</p>
<p>I love that conversation, especially because this skill is so important.</p>
<p>This could create a very awkward situation.</p>
<p>We need to be able to avoid that.</p>
<p>Right, Lindsay?</p>
<p>Oh, for sure.</p>
<p>Has this ever happened to you, Aubrey, in your life, in your working life that you,</p>
<p>you know, you invite a colleague out and they kind of just don&rsquo;t want to hang out after</p>
<p>work?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Because I&rsquo;m an inviter.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m always asking people, want to go to happy hour?</p>
<p>Want to do this?</p>
<p>Want to do this?</p>
<p>Both friends, family, coworkers.</p>
<p>And so inevitably, they&rsquo;re either not going to be available or maybe, you know, they just</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t feel like it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve definitely gotten some no&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>OK.</p>
<p>And yeah, I have to have this.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want to eliminate any awkwardness.</p>
<p>I have absolutely used all of the phrases that we taught here.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>I think in general in life, it&rsquo;s better to be the person that gets a lot of no&rsquo;s rather</p>
<p>than be the person that never asks and never knows.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I agree.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t mind.</p>
<p>You just have to be used to it.</p>
<p>Realize that it&rsquo;s almost always not personal.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And then have that vocabulary to be able to like keep it, you know, no awkwardness, keep</p>
<p>the connection strong.</p>
<p>My favorite phrase, let&rsquo;s share, our favorite phrase from this episode is to just say, oh,</p>
<p>I just thought I&rsquo;d throw it out there.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I love this.</p>
<p>I say it all the time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s such a native, natural way to let them know that you don&rsquo;t mind that they turned</p>
<p>you down.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a big deal.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re definitely going to invite them again or they should invite you another time.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>It kind of shows in a positive way that you didn&rsquo;t have a ton invested in them saying</p>
<p>yes.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>It was just a casual invite.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of a step back a little bit.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>But in a positive way, not in a passive aggressive way or a weird way.</p>
<p>And so this is going to let you come back to work the next day and feel totally normal</p>
<p>around that person.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not going to be like, oh, I need to avoid them because that was weird.</p>
<p>No, absolutely not.</p>
<p>They could invite you to happy hour the next day.</p>
<p>No worries.</p>
<p>And you can say no, if it doesn&rsquo;t work out and it would be fine.</p>
<p>They might say, oh, I thought I&rsquo;d just throw it out there.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>So good.</p>
<p>We have to have these skills for business to have a successful career because again,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not just meetings, presentations, writing, it&rsquo;s also socializing at work.</p>
