    <p>Our card this week is Randy Leach, the Four of Hearts from Idaho.</p>
<p>When Randy was 20 years old, he decided to take a break from college and hitchhike through</p>
<p>the American West.</p>
<p>What was supposed to be a journey of self-discovery turned into a mystery that 42 years later</p>
<p>remains unsolved.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Ashley Flowers, and this is The Deck.</p>
<p>On November 26th, 1980, Marjorie and Richard Leach were at home in northern Wisconsin preparing</p>
<p>for Thanksgiving as they eagerly awaited a phone call from their 20-year-old son Randy,</p>
<p>who was hitchhiking out west to visit some relatives.</p>
<p>The couple stayed close to the phone because it had been a few weeks since they had last</p>
<p>heard from Randy and they had a lot of catching up to do.</p>
<p>But Thanksgiving Eve came and went and Randy never called.</p>
<p>Marjorie thought it was weird because usually her son was good about checking in at least</p>
<p>once a week since he left home on November 1st, but the last time the Leaches had heard</p>
<p>from Randy was on November 6th.</p>
<p>Marjorie remembered that phone call vividly because it had been her birthday.</p>
<p>During their conversation, Randy wished her a happy birthday and told her that he had</p>
<p>taken a job at a dairy farm in Idaho Falls, Idaho, and that he might head toward California</p>
<p>and Oregon soon.</p>
<p>Marjorie said that he was especially excited to visit his sister Renee at her new house</p>
<p>in Bend, Oregon, which was his eventual destination.</p>
<p>But for most of the month of November, Renee and her husband were in the process of moving,</p>
<p>so Randy told Marjorie that he felt it was probably best to give them a few weeks to</p>
<p>get settled in and then he&rsquo;d start making his way to Bend through northern California.</p>
<p>He said there was a tofu farm that he was interested in and he might try to get a job</p>
<p>there while he killed some time on the road.</p>
<p>During that call, Randy also assured his parents not to worry about him if they didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>hear from him for a few days because he would probably be on the road, so they tried not</p>
<p>to.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t love that he was thumbing it out west, but his consistent check-ins from</p>
<p>gas station pay phones put them more at ease.</p>
<p>Not only would they get to hear his voice and know that he was okay, but he charged</p>
<p>nearly every call to his parents, so that was another way that they&rsquo;d been able to</p>
<p>keep track of him during his trip.</p>
<p>Even though Randy had failed to contact them the day before Thanksgiving, Marjorie and</p>
<p>Richard tried not to get too worried, since Randy said that he would be on the road without</p>
<p>immediate access to phones.</p>
<p>They assured one another that they would probably hear from him on Thanksgiving Day.</p>
<p>Randy always checked in on birthdays and holidays, no matter where he was, but Thanksgiving Day</p>
<p>rolled around and by late afternoon, Randy still had not called them, so they started</p>
<p>making calls.</p>
<p>They called Randy&rsquo;s sisters, aunts, uncles, and cousins, and no one else had heard from</p>
<p>or seen Randy either.</p>
<p>The Leaches could no longer ignore their fear that something wasn&rsquo;t right.</p>
<p>Richard went to the Sheboygan County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office, his local law enforcement agency,</p>
<p>to report his son missing.</p>
<p>He told an on-duty deputy what he knew, which was that Randy was hitchhiking out west, and</p>
<p>the last place they knew him to be was Idaho, where he was working on a dairy farm.</p>
<p>He had called them from Idaho on November 6th around 5 p.m. and said things were going</p>
<p>well, but since then, Richard said, he and his wife had not heard from their son.</p>
<p>The officer asked if they&rsquo;d tried reaching back out to him at the dairy farm where he</p>
<p>worked, and they had, but when they called, a person who answered the phone told them</p>
<p>that Randy had left and that he didn&rsquo;t leave any forwarding address information.</p>
<p>Richard told the Wisconsin deputy all about Randy&rsquo;s plans to go to California or Oregon</p>
<p>next, but they didn&rsquo;t think he was just traveling and out of touch because he should</p>
<p>have been there by now.</p>
<p>And there was one other big reason Richard said that he was so worried about his son.</p>
<p>Randy didn&rsquo;t have his photo ID on him.</p>
<p>Richard explained that on November 4th, so two days before his last phone call home,</p>
<p>Randy had called the house and asked his dad to mail his driver&rsquo;s license to the dairy</p>
<p>farm in Idaho.</p>
<p>According to Sheboygan County Sheriff&rsquo;s Detective Tyler Wiestenhagen, the owner of</p>
<p>the dairy farm had asked for his ID in order to hire him.</p>
<p>It sounded like he traveled pretty light, like didn&rsquo;t have a whole lot of stuff with</p>
<p>him.</p>
<p>And then apparently he forgot that and wanted it sent.</p>
<p>Richard told police he dropped his son&rsquo;s driver&rsquo;s license in the mail addressed to</p>
<p>Reed&rsquo;s dairy farm in care of Randy Leach.</p>
<p>But a few days later, someone at the farm told Richard that Randy had left before receiving</p>
<p>his ID in the mail.</p>
<p>When Richard heard that, he thought it was weird, but figured his son just forgot about</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>Richard told the employee at the dairy farm that he would just arrange to have it forwarded</p>
<p>to California once he knew where Randy would be staying.</p>
<p>The Sheboygan County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office took down the information and told Richard that</p>
<p>they would reach out to law enforcement in Idaho to see what they could find out.</p>
<p>When they made contact, someone at the Bonneville County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office in Eastern Idaho</p>
<p>said that they would ask a detective to go have a chat with the owner of the farm and</p>
<p>get the scoop on Randy&rsquo;s whereabouts.</p>
<p>The next day, Detective Clyde Burgess drove out to Reed&rsquo;s dairy farm to visit the owner,</p>
<p>a guy named Larry Reed.</p>
<p>The farm was just on the outskirts of Idaho Falls, Idaho, a small city about three hours</p>
<p>north of Salt Lake City, Utah.</p>
<p>During their interview with Larry, authorities in Idaho slowly started piecing together Randy&rsquo;s</p>
<p>last known movements and the last time anyone had seen him.</p>
<p>Larry told Detective Burgess that Randy had shown up at their dairy store on November</p>
<p>4th, asking if he could have a temporary job.</p>
<p>Mr. Reed was overhearing Randy talking about traveling west and they got to talking and</p>
<p>he offered him a place to stay for a couple of days and some work for a couple of days.</p>
<p>According to reports from 1980 that detectives shared with us, Randy told Larry that he was</p>
<p>hitchhiking across the country and he couldn&rsquo;t stick around for very long, but that he could</p>
<p>use a job for a couple of days before hitting the road again.</p>
<p>Larry said he agreed to give Randy some work in a handshake deal.</p>
<p>Larry would provide lodging and meals and a little cash and Randy would help him finish</p>
<p>building a shed on the farm.</p>
<p>Back then, Larry had two other farm hands working for him and they slept in a bunkhouse</p>
<p>on the property.</p>
<p>After taking the job, Randy was given the option to sleep on the couch in the bunkhouse</p>
<p>with the other two men and he agreed, no problem.</p>
<p>On that first night, November 4th, Randy joined the Reeds for dinner at their home.</p>
<p>The Reeds were members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and Larry said</p>
<p>he&rsquo;d also invited a couple of missionaries to dinner so Randy could learn about their</p>
<p>Mormon faith.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s limited information about exactly how the topic of religion first came up.</p>
<p>Most of it came solely from Larry&rsquo;s interview, but according to police, the missionaries</p>
<p>got to the Reeds at 7 p.m. and Larry, his wife Carol, Randy, and the two elders all</p>
<p>shared a meal together.</p>
<p>Detective Burgess asked Larry what Randy&rsquo;s demeanor was like during his stay at the farm</p>
<p>and Larry said he seemed like a nice, smart young man.</p>
<p>During dinner, Larry said Randy had talked about how he was fascinated by different cultures</p>
<p>and religions.</p>
<p>Larry said they all had a nice time and Randy had asked the missionaries a lot of questions</p>
<p>about the Mormon faith.</p>
<p>And before everyone parted ways around 9.30 p.m., the men gave Randy a copy of the Book</p>
<p>of Mormon.</p>
<p>Little else is known about that evening beyond what Larry told Detective Burgess because</p>
<p>police never tracked down or interviewed the two missionaries.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s something Detective Wiestenhagen wishes he knew more about.</p>
<p>Why would you have these two guys come talk to this guy that just showed up to work for</p>
<p>a couple days?</p>
<p>Like, how in-depth was this conversation about religion that, like, these guys had to come</p>
<p>and talk and give a Bible to and it&rsquo;s just odd.</p>
<p>Elders or missionaries are basically recruiters for the LDS faith.</p>
<p>A lot of people who live in eastern Idaho are LDS, so while talking religion at dinner</p>
<p>and giving someone the Book of Mormon might sound a little strange or even aggressive</p>
<p>to some of us, it probably wasn&rsquo;t uncommon for someone like Larry Reed to invite these</p>
<p>missionaries over to try and convert Randy.</p>
<p>When police pushed Larry about what happened the rest of Randy&rsquo;s time there, he said</p>
<p>the next morning on November 5th, he and Randy got up early to continue building the shed.</p>
<p>When they were working, Randy mentioned kind of offhand that he heard snow was in the forecast.</p>
<p>And he said he might need to hit the road sooner than he thought because of the weather.</p>
<p>But he assured Larry that he would stay until they finished the shed.</p>
<p>Larry said during that conversation, Randy also mentioned that he wasn&rsquo;t interested</p>
<p>in seeing the missionaries again, and for Larry not to expect him for dinner because</p>
<p>he decided to fast that day.</p>
<p>To the Reeds, Randy seemed like he was really looking forward to getting to his sister&rsquo;s</p>
<p>house in Oregon.</p>
<p>He talked fondly of his whole family, and Larry said that he seemed to call them often.</p>
<p>The next day, November 6th, Randy helped finish the shed construction, and around 5 p.m.,</p>
<p>he borrowed the Reeds&rsquo; phone to call his mom to wish her a happy birthday.</p>
<p>It was on that call that Randy told his mom he might head to California before going to</p>
<p>Oregon and not to worry about him.</p>
<p>They said their I love you&rsquo;s and then hung up.</p>
<p>When Randy got off the phone, Larry&rsquo;s wife, Carol, offered to do Randy&rsquo;s laundry before</p>
<p>he left the farm.</p>
<p>And Randy gave her a pair of jeans to wash, according to reports.</p>
<p>Larry told authorities the last time he laid eyes on Randy was between 6.30 and 7.30 a.m.</p>
<p>the next morning, on November 7th.</p>
<p>Larry had said that he was walking from his house to the dairy building and saw Randy</p>
<p>walking down the road, basically.</p>
<p>There was no conversation as far as him leaving.</p>
<p>He just said he saw him walking away.</p>
<p>Larry said after seeing Randy walking east toward the highway that went to town, he walked</p>
<p>over to the bunkhouse and realized Randy had cleaned out all of his stuff, which he thought</p>
<p>was weird since he didn&rsquo;t say goodbye or, even stranger, come to get the paycheck he&rsquo;d</p>
<p>been working for.</p>
<p>Larry told police he then went to the farm&rsquo;s business office and calculated Randy&rsquo;s hours</p>
<p>from the last couple of days&rsquo; work and wrote him a check in case he decided to come back.</p>
<p>Then he said he went to his house and told his wife, Carol, that he believed Randy had</p>
<p>left the farm for good.</p>
<p>She thought his departure odd too, since Randy had forgotten his jeans that she&rsquo;d just washed</p>
<p>the night before.</p>
<p>Larry said he grabbed Randy&rsquo;s paycheck and pants and drove down the highway to see if</p>
<p>he could maybe catch Randy walking or trying to hitchhike.</p>
<p>But after driving a few miles, Larry said he didn&rsquo;t find him, so he went back home</p>
<p>and stashed the jeans and check in case the young man came back or called.</p>
<p>But the Reeds didn&rsquo;t hear from Randy again after that, and they didn&rsquo;t think much about</p>
<p>it until law enforcement had contacted them.</p>
<p>When the Idaho detective asked Larry if there had been any conflict while Randy was at the</p>
<p>farm, Larry said no, but then admitted that he had, quote, landed pretty hard on Randy</p>
<p>for his poor workmanship, end quote.</p>
<p>According to police reports, Larry later wondered if maybe his criticism of Randy&rsquo;s handy skills</p>
<p>had discouraged him, and maybe that had something to do with why he&rsquo;d taken off so abruptly.</p>
<p>Detective Burgess&rsquo;s interview with Larry was the unofficial start of the investigation</p>
<p>into Randy Leach&rsquo;s whereabouts, but a formal investigation didn&rsquo;t really take off right away.</p>
<p>Despite Randy&rsquo;s parents and siblings being really worried about him, police in Wisconsin</p>
<p>and Idaho said that the best thing the family could do was just wait it out.</p>
<p>Law enforcement felt confident that eventually Randy would check in with his parents and</p>
<p>assure them that all was well.</p>
<p>But another week went by, and the Leach family still had not heard from Randy.</p>
<p>On December 1st, 1980, his dad Richard went back to the Sheboygan County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office</p>
<p>to reiterate his concerns.</p>
<p>Richard personally knew the deputy inspector, a guy named Robert Thurman, who oversaw investigations</p>
<p>there at the time.</p>
<p>Inspector Thurman met with him, but he said there was little the department could do.</p>
<p>If Randy didn&rsquo;t want to call his family, he was 20 years old, and that was his right.</p>
<p>But Inspector Thurman promised to try and keep tabs on things as a personal favor to</p>
<p>Richard since they were friends.</p>
<p>Richard emphasized that there was zero chance his son would willingly cut off contact with them.</p>
<p>The Leach family was very close, and Randy was bright, responsible, and had big plans</p>
<p>for his future.</p>
<p>And Richard&rsquo;s comments about Randy weren&rsquo;t just him being a proud dad, either.</p>
<p>Randy was exceptionally smart and mature.</p>
<p>When he was a senior in high school in 1978, he&rsquo;d won a national scholarship contest,</p>
<p>beating more than 350,000 other students.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a Sheboygan Press article from 1978 titled The Wiz Wins, which shows a photo</p>
<p>of Randy smiling big and looking right at the camera with his hand on a globe.</p>
<p>He won with an essay he wrote about the U.S. arms race, and sealed the deal by wowing the</p>
<p>judges through an interview process where he answered questions about the United States</p>
<p>relations with the Middle East.</p>
<p>When he graduated, Randy told the Sheboygan Press that he wanted to pursue a career in</p>
<p>international relations and diplomacy.</p>
<p>He joked that he, quote, wouldn&rsquo;t mind being secretary of state, end quote.</p>
<p>After graduating high school, Randy enrolled in a local community college in Wisconsin</p>
<p>and then transferred to a college in East Africa where he studied social justice issues</p>
<p>and volunteered with refugee camps.</p>
<p>His dad later told the Sheboygan Press that when Randy got home from studying abroad in</p>
<p>December of 1979, he seemed disillusioned, shaken, not himself, and also showed signs</p>
<p>of being malnourished.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a voice actor reading Richard&rsquo;s statement about his son.</p>
<p>After he&rsquo;d returned to Wisconsin, Randy had decided to press pause on his college studies.</p>
<p>In the summer of 1980, Randy took a job at a dairy farm near home, but that gig didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>last for long.</p>
<p>After seeing the Carson and Barnes Circus perform, he decided to take a job with the</p>
<p>performers.</p>
<p>People who knew Randy later said that the subculture of the circus life appealed to</p>
<p>him.</p>
<p>He got very involved in the communities surrounding his work and had attended prayer meetings</p>
<p>with a Native American man known as Chief, who also worked at the circus.</p>
<p>Reportedly, through those prayer meetings, Randy became what he referred to as a born-again</p>
<p>Christian.</p>
<p>By the end of October 1980, Randy had left the circus, and a few weeks after that, set</p>
<p>out on his cross-country hitchhike journey.</p>
<p>To appease Richard, Sheboygan County deputies contacted the sheriff&rsquo;s office in Idaho</p>
<p>again in December, and they said, as far as they could tell, Randy Leach left their jurisdiction</p>
<p>on November 7th unharmed.</p>
<p>They based their assumption off their earlier interview with Larry Reed.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Randy&rsquo;s parents were calling anyone they could think of who might be able</p>
<p>to help them locate their son, including the Oregon State Police, since Randy&rsquo;s eventual</p>
<p>destination was Bend, Oregon.</p>
<p>They also contacted law enforcement agencies in Northern California, since Randy had mentioned</p>
<p>that he might stop at a farm there.</p>
<p>They even called farms in Northern California, but none of them were tofu farms.</p>
<p>They said they didn&rsquo;t know of any tofu farms in the area.</p>
<p>Ultimately, not much came from any of those efforts, though Oregon State Police did agree</p>
<p>to file a missing persons report for Randy to keep his face on local police agencies&rsquo; radars.</p>
<p>They listed him as a 20-year-old man with a slim build and brown, bushy hair and blue eyes.</p>
<p>So, I mean, they were, I think, really involved in trying to do all they could, but kept running</p>
<p>into these problems of, whose problem is he?</p>
<p>You know, like, is he Sheboygan&rsquo;s, is he Oregon&rsquo;s, is he Idaho&rsquo;s?</p>
<p>I think they were just going to everyone to try and get what they could get done.</p>
<p>By Christmas Day, 1980, the Leaches had no luck in finding their son or making contact with him.</p>
<p>Police urged them to stay hopeful, but also said that since Randy was traveling in the</p>
<p>mountains at the start of winter, there might have been some kind of accident and he could be dead.</p>
<p>If that was the case, they said his body might not be discovered until spring when the snow melted.</p>
<p>The Leach family tried to keep their minds from going there, and they had a big reason</p>
<p>not to believe that their son was dead.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because they told police in Wisconsin that someone had been calling them over and</p>
<p>over again, and they thought that that someone was Randy.</p>
<p>Not long after they reported Randy missing, in November 1980, the Leach family started</p>
<p>receiving mysterious phone calls, but every time they would answer, the caller didn&rsquo;t say anything.</p>
<p>Richard told police, quote,</p>
<p>We know it&rsquo;s an open-ended lie, but no one speaks, just silence, end quote.</p>
<p>Marjorie and Richard were getting these calls at their Wisconsin house, and Randy&rsquo;s sisters</p>
<p>were getting them at their houses too, even Renee, who lived in Oregon.</p>
<p>They all told authorities this same thing, that they could tell someone was on the other</p>
<p>end of the line, but whoever it was never said anything.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a voice actor reading exactly what the officer wrote in his report after interviewing</p>
<p>Randy&rsquo;s sister Michelle about the bizarre calls.</p>
<p>Michelle explained that two or three times a week for several months, they would receive</p>
<p>this type of hang-up call.</p>
<p>No one would be on the line in terms of talking or having any conversation, but they could</p>
<p>also tell someone else was there.</p>
<p>Michelle&rsquo;s mother thought it was Randy calling, so she would talk to him as if they were Randy,</p>
<p>even though no one was speaking.</p>
<p>Eventually, the other children would do the same.</p>
<p>Michelle explained the reason they suspected it was Randy was because there were times</p>
<p>in high school when they would use a payphone to let them know that they could be picked</p>
<p>up after an activity.</p>
<p>Michelle explained at that time if you put five or ten cents into the phone, you could</p>
<p>speak on the phone, but if you did not put money in the payphone, you simply dialed the</p>
<p>number and you would be able to make the call, but not be heard when you spoke.</p>
<p>Marjorie and Richard tried to have the calls traced, but the effort didn&rsquo;t result in much.</p>
<p>One of the calls that went to Renee in Bend, Oregon was traced to Southwest Oregon, but</p>
<p>the calls to the Leach family home in Wisconsin could only be categorized as long distance.</p>
<p>It was pretty much a dead end.</p>
<p>After months of these bizarre calls, the family couldn&rsquo;t do it anymore.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s Detective Wiestenhagen again.</p>
<p>Eventually, they all felt foolish speaking to nothing, and they knew he&rsquo;d been able to</p>
<p>make phone calls previously by charging them, so he&rsquo;s got the ability to make phone calls.</p>
<p>You know, why would he be doing this when in the past they&rsquo;ve never been a problem?</p>
<p>I think they kind of just gave up on it.</p>
<p>When the new year rolled around, Randy&rsquo;s family couldn&rsquo;t take it anymore.</p>
<p>They had to do something to make progress in the case, with or without law enforcement&rsquo;s</p>
<p>help.</p>
<p>In January of 1981, two of his uncles headed out west to look for Randy.</p>
<p>They carried posters with his photo on them, taping them up in Idaho, California, Oregon,</p>
<p>and Nevada.</p>
<p>They wrote letters to Native American reservations, national parks, and colleges along routes</p>
<p>that they thought Randy might have taken.</p>
<p>Some people even responded to their letters, suggesting that the family check with everyone</p>
<p>from psychics to cults to immigration authorities to see if Randy had used his passport.</p>
<p>One letter suggested that maybe he&rsquo;d returned to Africa without telling anyone.</p>
<p>The Leach family got Randy&rsquo;s name entered into the National Database for Missing People.</p>
<p>They also allowed an insurance investigator to do some digging in case his social security</p>
<p>number was used somewhere, but nothing came up.</p>
<p>Marjorie and Richard were desperate and doing everything they felt police should have been</p>
<p>doing.</p>
<p>They even widened their search and called law enforcement and coroner&rsquo;s offices in</p>
<p>Utah, Washington, and Nevada, California, and Oregon, just to see if any unclaimed bodies</p>
<p>had shown up.</p>
<p>Randy&rsquo;s family members took turns taking trips out west looking for him.</p>
<p>Winter turned to spring, and by April of 1981, Marjorie and Richard again went to Idaho.</p>
<p>They wanted to see for themselves the part of the country where their son had been living.</p>
<p>Police aren&rsquo;t sure what exactly the Leaches did while in Idaho.</p>
<p>They just know that they were desperate to find out more, and going out there felt better</p>
<p>than sitting at home and doing nothing.</p>
<p>But their trip ended in disappointment.</p>
<p>They found out that the deputies with the Bonneville County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office had never</p>
<p>actually filed a missing persons report for Randy.</p>
<p>The couple went home brokenhearted.</p>
<p>They couldn&rsquo;t wrap their minds around the oversight.</p>
<p>I mean, their son had vanished from Idaho.</p>
<p>Why had he never been listed as a missing person there?</p>
<p>On May 3rd, 1981, the Leaches sent a letter to the Bonneville County Sheriff.</p>
<p>They wrote that, at the very least, detectives with the department should be able to answer</p>
<p>some questions about the last known sighting of their son since he&rsquo;d vanished in their</p>
<p>jurisdiction.</p>
<p>Questions like, what time did Randy actually leave the Reed Dairy Farm?</p>
<p>How did farmer Larry Reed know it was Randy that he saw leaving?</p>
<p>When did it first occur to Larry that Randy left without his wages?</p>
<p>How much money was owed to him?</p>
<p>And what was done with the check?</p>
<p>What was done with the jeans that Randy had left behind?</p>
<p>Did Randy make any comments to the owners of the farm?</p>
<p>Were there any cults in the area that law enforcement knew of?</p>
<p>Marjorie and Richard said in that letter that they were not implying that anyone at the</p>
<p>farm did anything to Randy, but they wanted to know more about their son&rsquo;s last known</p>
<p>contact before he vanished.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an excerpt from the letter read by an actor.</p>
<p>Our son disappeared on a hitchhiking trip from South Dakota to Bend, Oregon, where he</p>
<p>intended to visit his sister, and stopped to work at the Reed Dairy Farm for a couple</p>
<p>days.</p>
<p>We had regular communication with him via telephone and letter until that time.</p>
<p>We reported him missing to our Sheboygan County Sheriff when he did not contact us at Thanksgiving</p>
<p>as planned.</p>
<p>It is vital to establish Idaho Falls as a reference point for the investigation.</p>
<p>We are again enclosing all pertinent information and again respectfully request an official</p>
<p>missing persons report be filed in your office.</p>
<p>A few weeks later, on May 19th, 1981, the Bonneville County Sheriff responded to the</p>
<p>Leach&rsquo;s letter.</p>
<p>It is apparent that he left this area of his own free will and in no danger.</p>
<p>The Reeds, who are very good members of our community, state that the only problem Randall</p>
<p>had was his uncertain thoughts on religion.</p>
<p>We do not have any religious cults in this area.</p>
<p>The Sheriff went on to say that he felt bad about the fact that the Leach&rsquo;s had been</p>
<p>under the impression that an official missing persons report had been filed in Idaho, but</p>
<p>he basically said that the case wasn&rsquo;t their problem.</p>
<p>With reports on file in Sheboygan, Boise, Bend, and Sacramento, besides our office,</p>
<p>it appears that the situation is well covered and if any leads or information is developed,</p>
<p>you will be notified immediately.</p>
<p>Something that didn&rsquo;t sit right with the Leach&rsquo;s was that the Sheriff said Randy</p>
<p>left Idaho Falls on his own and in no danger like it was a proven fact, when in reality</p>
<p>Bonneville County actually had no proof that Randy had left safely.</p>
<p>And by calling the Reeds, quote, very good members of the community, the Sheriff basically</p>
<p>admits that his agency just had taken the Reeds&rsquo; word for it that Randy left their</p>
<p>farm unharmed.</p>
<p>I imagine the Leach family was disappointed in receiving such a dismissive letter from</p>
<p>the Sheriff of the county where their son was last seen.</p>
<p>I mean, I know I would be.</p>
<p>The Leach&rsquo;s continued to conduct their own investigation and tried to think of all the</p>
<p>possibilities regarding what could have happened to Randy.</p>
<p>Like maybe he became wrapped up in his spiritual journey and joined a commune.</p>
<p>It seemed far-fetched, but they were desperate to hang on to hope that Randy was still alive.</p>
<p>So in July 1981, Marjorie and Randy&rsquo;s sister, Michelle, went back out west to see if they</p>
<p>could find Randy with a group known as the Christ family.</p>
<p>The Christ family was active in the seventies and early eighties in the Western U.S.</p>
<p>According to reporting in the Muncie Star from June, 1980, the Christ family was a religious</p>
<p>cult scattered all around the country that preached against violence, sex, materialism,</p>
<p>and eating meat.</p>
<p>Another 1980 story in the Chico Enterprise records stated that the Christ family was</p>
<p>known to teach its members not to acknowledge their birth parents.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a ton of news stories from back then about parents from all over who were</p>
<p>trying to save their teenage or twenty-something children from the Christ family.</p>
<p>Marjorie and Michelle stopped in various cities connecting with groups who were working to</p>
<p>identify and save Christ family members.</p>
<p>Because members took Christ as their last name and sometimes changed their first names,</p>
<p>they thought maybe Randy had been brainwashed and forgotten who he was.</p>
<p>But the Leach&rsquo;s didn&rsquo;t find him, and they had to go back home, once again with more</p>
<p>questions than answers.</p>
<p>When Marjorie&rsquo;s birthday came in November 1981, it was a grim reminder of the last time</p>
<p>she&rsquo;d heard from her son.</p>
<p>It had been an agonizing year for the family, and in an effort to express their pain and</p>
<p>grief, they talked with a local Wisconsin newspaper.</p>
<p>They had tried everything else up until that point, so they figured it couldn&rsquo;t hurt</p>
<p>to get Randy&rsquo;s case some attention in the press.</p>
<p>On November 6th, 1981, a story with the headline, Where is Randy Leach? ran across the front</p>
<p>page of the Sheboygan Press.</p>
<p>The article detailed Randy&rsquo;s success as a high school student, his work and studies</p>
<p>in Africa, and how he wanted to work for the United Nations someday.</p>
<p>The piece talked about how he was a critical thinker and not exactly the type to be brainwashed</p>
<p>by a cult.</p>
<p>The underlying question for everyone who read it was, how did a smart young man seemingly</p>
<p>just disappear from a dairy farm in Idaho?</p>
<p>But this blast of press didn&rsquo;t do much to advance the case.</p>
<p>Reports passed with no new information.</p>
<p>Only theories swirled as to what happened to Randy.</p>
<p>In the summer of 1982, the Leach family set out on their third trip out west since Randy&rsquo;s</p>
<p>disappearance.</p>
<p>Richard spent 16 days driving over 4,000 miles trying to track down anyone who might have</p>
<p>come in contact with his son the week that he went missing.</p>
<p>This drummed up more press, this time in Idaho.</p>
<p>The Times News out of Twin Falls interviewed Richard.</p>
<p>The newspaper described him as a soft-spoken man turned private investigator on a quest</p>
<p>to find his son.</p>
<p>Richard told the newspaper he was heading to Boise to meet with members of a communal</p>
<p>living society known as the Rainbow Family to see if anyone with that group recognized</p>
<p>Randy as having been at their gatherings.</p>
<p>The Rainbow Family is a group that travels around and holds gatherings on U.S. Forest</p>
<p>Service land.</p>
<p>They aren&rsquo;t associated with a religion or anything, but Richard knew that they might</p>
<p>be able to convince his son to join their movement, just based on the fact that Randy</p>
<p>was impressionable when it came to philosophical and spiritual beliefs.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a voice actor reading what Richard told the Times News.</p>
<p>The frustration is that law enforcement agencies will do very little without evidence of foul</p>
<p>play or mental problems.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t have the resources for a private investigator, you have to do it yourself.</p>
<p>Randy was having a difficult time with our culture&rsquo;s materialism, and he empathized</p>
<p>with those in poverty.</p>
<p>We know cults appeal to that kind of idealism, and they can brainwash quickly.</p>
<p>You fluctuate between hope and despair.</p>
<p>There are times you do a lot of crying.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s especially hard on my wife.</p>
<p>One of the things that keeps us going is that we have a lot of prayers.</p>
<p>We will keep looking until we find him, dead or alive.</p>
<p>Richard told reporters that Randy wasn&rsquo;t just kind of anti-materialistic.</p>
<p>He was extreme in that sense.</p>
<p>He idolized St. Francis of Assisi, the monk who took a vow of poverty.</p>
<p>Randy had actually dropped out of his college in Africa because the scholarship that he&rsquo;d</p>
<p>won to send him there was funded by the Shell Oil Corporation.</p>
<p>He said he objected to the exploitation of third world nations by massive corporations.</p>
<p>His family held onto hope that maybe Randy&rsquo;s vanishing was just the result of him having</p>
<p>taken a vow of silence in poverty with a group who had similar beliefs as him, like</p>
<p>the Christ family or the Rainbow family.</p>
<p>But the years continued to pass, and their hope that he was still alive but just living</p>
<p>off the grid somewhere faded.</p>
<p>According to documents in the police case file, Marjorie Leach died in 1989.</p>
<p>She passed away not knowing what happened to her son.</p>
<p>Then, a few years later in 1993, a former detective in Wisconsin took matters into his</p>
<p>own hands, and he flew to Idaho to conduct the first-ever actual investigation into Randy</p>
<p>Leach&rsquo;s disappearance.</p>
<p>And what he found was eye-opening.</p>
<p>Thirteen years after Randy vanished, former Deputy Inspector Robert Thurman from Sheboygan</p>
<p>County, Wisconsin, the investigator who took Richard&rsquo;s original report in 1980, decided</p>
<p>to go to Idaho and investigate.</p>
<p>There had been no official investigation up until that point, and according to the</p>
<p>research material we collected, no police had ever seriously looked for Randy.</p>
<p>Robert Thurman had retired from the Sheboygan County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office years before, but</p>
<p>he felt he owed it to the Leach family to at least try.</p>
<p>So on his own dime, he flew to Salt Lake City and drove up to Idaho Falls.</p>
<p>Looking at the map, Robert realized that if Randy had left Idaho, there were only a few</p>
<p>routes that would have made sense for him to take in order to get to Northern California</p>
<p>or Oregon.</p>
<p>Robert kept a detailed log of his investigation while he was out West, and he wrote in reports</p>
<p>that when he first arrived, he went on a few off-road excursions that took him to uninhabited</p>
<p>areas that hugged the Snake River, on the off chance that he would find Randy&rsquo;s remains.</p>
<p>He described seeing nothing but grain farms and potato fields.</p>
<p>The next morning, on September 27th, 1993, Robert called Larry Reed, who still ran the</p>
<p>dairy farm.</p>
<p>Larry invited him to the house, and by 8 a.m., the detective was seated at Larry&rsquo;s kitchen</p>
<p>table where Randy Leach had sat 13 years before.</p>
<p>In Robert&rsquo;s reports, he said Larry was relaxed.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a voice actor reading the investigator&rsquo;s notes.</p>
<p>We talked in general about Randy, his disappearance, and the layout of the property.</p>
<p>His current version is generally consistent with what he&rsquo;d said in previous reports.</p>
<p>After some discussion of a couple discrepancies, I was satisfied.</p>
<p>The main problem was differences in the time Randy was reported to have left.</p>
<p>Larry said he always gets up at 5 or 5.30 and does a little paperwork.</p>
<p>When he went to the kitchen sink, he saw Randy walking across the road East toward town.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if Robert caught the discrepancy in Larry&rsquo;s story, but in 1980, Larry told</p>
<p>police that he was walking outside when he happened to glance over and see Randy leaving.</p>
<p>But in his 1993 statement to Robert, Larry said he saw the 20-year-old leaving while</p>
<p>standing over his kitchen sink.</p>
<p>Anyway, Larry told Robert that he remembered being worried when he went looking for Randy</p>
<p>and couldn&rsquo;t find him, and the detective asked why.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s Detective Wiestenhagen again.</p>
<p>He wasn&rsquo;t a very large man, and he was a nice-looking boy, very peaceful, loving type,</p>
<p>and they just didn&rsquo;t think he belonged out there alone.</p>
<p>Larry&rsquo;s wife, Carol, came home while Robert was still there.</p>
<p>She reiterated that she&rsquo;d washed Randy&rsquo;s jeans, but he never came back for them.</p>
<p>Detectives today wish they knew more about the pants, but it seems that no one ever collected</p>
<p>the jeans as evidence.</p>
<p>In fact, nowhere in the case file does it say what happened to Randy&rsquo;s jeans at all.</p>
<p>Investigators now are only left to speculate.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m thinking he must have had just two pair, one pair he was wearing and this other pair.</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t know why you would leave your pants behind.</p>
<p>That seems kind of odd.</p>
<p>From the Reeds&rsquo; house, Robert went to the Bonneville County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office to get</p>
<p>any records that they kept on Randy&rsquo;s disappearance to make sure he had all of the information</p>
<p>that was available.</p>
<p>He also wanted to do criminal background searches on the Reeds, you know, just in case.</p>
<p>He wrote that his searches turned up zero information about the Reeds ever having any</p>
<p>trouble with law enforcement.</p>
<p>The next day, Robert tracked down and interviewed one of the old farmhands, a guy named Don</p>
<p>who saw Randy in the bunkhouse the morning he went missing.</p>
<p>Don had left the Reed dairy farm two weeks after Randy disappeared because he said that</p>
<p>he needed a better paying job.</p>
<p>He said that he remembered Randy, but didn&rsquo;t have any memories beyond seeing him in the</p>
<p>early morning of November 7th, 1980 in the bunkhouse.</p>
<p>Robert also met with the old sheriff in Idaho Falls who was in office at the time of Randy&rsquo;s</p>
<p>disappearance.</p>
<p>But he said that his term as sheriff ended in January 1981 and he&rsquo;d moved away.</p>
<p>So he didn&rsquo;t have much to add.</p>
<p>Robert wasn&rsquo;t able to track down Clyde Burgess, the detective who had originally questioned</p>
<p>Larry Reed.</p>
<p>Clyde had left the Bonneville County Sheriff&rsquo;s office in the early nineties and he&rsquo;s passed</p>
<p>away now.</p>
<p>So by the time Robert headed back to Wisconsin at the end of September, 1993, he had no new</p>
<p>conclusions or really any solid information about what had happened to Randy.</p>
<p>In the summary of his report, he said that he couldn&rsquo;t come up with any proof that Randy</p>
<p>ever left the Reed dairy farm in November, 1980, but that he probably did.</p>
<p>Since Robert had been investigating the case unofficially, he left the case file at his</p>
<p>house and kept working on it in his spare time, but nothing new came up in the years</p>
<p>that followed.</p>
<p>The Leach family eventually lost hope and stopped going on investigative trips out West.</p>
<p>They did what so many families of missing people do.</p>
<p>They waited for news to come their way, good or bad.</p>
<p>In 2003, Robert Thurman died and his wife came across the file that her husband had</p>
<p>kept on Randy&rsquo;s case and she took it to the Sheboygan County Sheriff&rsquo;s office.</p>
<p>That prompted detectives to look through it and they were like, well, we might as well</p>
<p>try and get DNA from Randy&rsquo;s family members to get a profile on him.</p>
<p>And that at the very least, we&rsquo;ll see if we get a hit on any John Does around the country.</p>
<p>Between 2004 and 2013, detectives tested Randy&rsquo;s DNA profile and dental records against multiple</p>
<p>John Does in Washington, California, Oregon, and Colorado, but they got no hits.</p>
<p>In 2014, police submitted Randy&rsquo;s DNA to the University of North Texas Center for Human</p>
<p>Identifications and CODIS, but still nothing came up for him.</p>
<p>In November 2015, the Idaho Falls Post Register ran a big story featuring Randy&rsquo;s sister Renee.</p>
<p>The article quoted Bonneville County Sheriff at the time, Paul Wild, who said that all</p>
<p>he could say for sure was that no one at the dairy farm had hurt Randy.</p>
<p>The story doesn&rsquo;t provide any information on how the sheriff knew that though.</p>
<p>From Detective Wiestenhagen&rsquo;s case file, no one can say what investigative work was</p>
<p>done to come to that conclusion.</p>
<p>The article also has some big contradictory information, like it says that Randy worked</p>
<p>at the dairy farm before quote, grabbing a ride from the landowner to a junction to hitchhike.</p>
<p>But we know from Larry&rsquo;s past statement to law enforcement that he said that he saw</p>
<p>Randy walking away from the farm.</p>
<p>Nowhere does it say that Larry gave Randy a ride somewhere, so I have no idea where</p>
<p>that information came from.</p>
<p>Sheriff Wild said in that same 2015 article that the case file kept in Idaho just has</p>
<p>some old news clippings in it, no investigative notes at all.</p>
<p>The current investigations lieutenant at the Bonneville County Sheriff&rsquo;s office told our</p>
<p>reporting team that there was a flood in the agency&rsquo;s basement, which is probably why</p>
<p>the investigative notes were lost.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t help but feel frustrated for the Leach family, knowing that there was barely</p>
<p>any effort put into finding Randy early on in the investigation.</p>
<p>I know it was complicated from the beginning since Randy was hitchhiking across the country</p>
<p>and had several different destinations planned, but still he went missing in Idaho Falls.</p>
<p>It makes no sense as to why there wasn&rsquo;t at least a missing persons report for him</p>
<p>in Idaho.</p>
<p>Looking at the case today, Detective Wiestenhagen wonders if Randy would have been found if</p>
<p>just one department would have been willing to take the lead in tracking him down.</p>
<p>I just think that there was such a problem back in that time of getting somebody to take</p>
<p>responsibility and to actually investigate it.</p>
<p>It seems like nobody really wanted to touch the hot potato, like they just kept passing</p>
<p>it to each other.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s part of the problem was that just nobody took ownership.</p>
<p>And I think it was difficult back in those days for our department to kind of coordinate</p>
<p>things out there because, you know, everything&rsquo;s being sent back and forth via mail, which</p>
<p>is going to take days.</p>
<p>I just think that there was a lack of somebody really wanting to take it on.</p>
<p>Because no one has truly owned the investigation from the beginning, Detective Wiestenhagen</p>
<p>said there are key people who were never interviewed, like the two missionaries who had dinner with</p>
<p>the Reeds and Randy at the farm the first night he was there.</p>
<p>Their full names weren&rsquo;t even listed in any reports, they&rsquo;re just called elders.</p>
<p>And a huge problem with the investigation in 1980 is that law enforcement never physically</p>
<p>searched the dairy farm or any land near it.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t do ground searches near the highway or any areas in Idaho Falls that Randy might</p>
<p>have walked through.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t question the farmhands who he had shared a cabin with.</p>
<p>Authorities took the farmer at his word, which I&rsquo;m not sure would happen today.</p>
<p>It just seems like a lot of their information that they have is that, you know, they talk</p>
<p>to him, this is what he said happened.</p>
<p>So they just said that happened, you know, without looking any further.</p>
<p>And I can&rsquo;t fault them for it, but I&rsquo;m thinking in this day and age, we would probably go</p>
<p>back to the farmer and be like, hey, do you mind if we check your place, you know, and</p>
<p>just walk around and make sure that nothing&rsquo;s here, you know, maybe not saying you did anything,</p>
<p>but you never know if there&rsquo;s other employees at hand or something, just to rule that all</p>
<p>out.</p>
<p>So I think in this day and age, we would probably do that, but, you know, I don&rsquo;t think we can</p>
<p>totally rule out the fact that something didn&rsquo;t happen on the property with him.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s just some questions and some concerns about that.</p>
<p>In 2016, one of Randy&rsquo;s aunts started sending letters to investigators suggesting some wild</p>
<p>ideas, like maybe Randy was killed because of prejudicial hatred or taken by someone</p>
<p>with a sexual motive and tossed into the Snake River or buried on the dairy farm.</p>
<p>Current investigators have considered all of those possibilities, but there just isn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>enough information to substantiate any of those ideas.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve also had to consider that maybe Randy really did try to hitchhike his way out of</p>
<p>Idaho in November, 1980 and died from exposure.</p>
<p>Maybe he couldn&rsquo;t find a ride and froze to death while camping in frigid mountain temperatures</p>
<p>and his body&rsquo;s just never been found.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve also considered whether or not he was the victim of a serial killer.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s at least one that was in the same area as Randy in the fall of 1980.</p>
<p>Randall Woodfield, from 1980 to 81.</p>
<p>He was active in California, Oregon.</p>
<p>One confirmed victim, but there&rsquo;s 44 other suspect ones.</p>
<p>According to past reporting by the Oregonian newspaper, Randall Woodfield was on a killing</p>
<p>spree between October 1980 and February 1981 in California and Oregon.</p>
<p>His DNA connected him to at least seven murders from that time.</p>
<p>The timeline and locations of Woodfield&rsquo;s crimes works, in theory, for Randy Leach,</p>
<p>but Woodfield was known to sexually assault and kill women.</p>
<p>According to reporting by Benjamin Smith for Oxygen, the only male victim Woodfield was</p>
<p>linked to was one of his victim&rsquo;s boyfriends, who was likely not his intended target.</p>
<p>Woodfield is in prison in Oregon and has never confessed to any of the killings that</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s been linked to, despite witnesses connecting him to his crimes and DNA matches.</p>
<p>Ultimately, detectives have not come up with any proof that Randall Woodfield crossed paths</p>
<p>with Randy in 1980, even though it could be a possibility.</p>
<p>So the last theory that law enforcement had to consider is the possibility that Randy</p>
<p>vanished on purpose.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the fact that maybe he just did want to disappear and go do his own thing.</p>
<p>I guess that would seem kind of out of character and not really in line with what the family</p>
<p>would think he would do.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know that that necessarily would have happened, just given the fact that he</p>
<p>was so into making these phone calls all the time that what would suddenly make him just</p>
<p>not want to do that anymore.</p>
<p>Detective Wiestenhagen is the fourth detective in Wisconsin to officially investigate Randy&rsquo;s</p>
<p>case.</p>
<p>He took it on in early 2021.</p>
<p>When our reporting team was in Wisconsin for this episode, Randy&rsquo;s sister Renee sent Detective</p>
<p>Wiestenhagen an email and told him their family appreciates their work done in the past and</p>
<p>the chance to have a fresh set of eyes on the case, but that they didn&rsquo;t have much</p>
<p>else to add.</p>
<p>Renee said, quote, we still always wonder what could have happened to Randy and love</p>
<p>him dearly.</p>
<p>The farm owner, Larry Reed, is now deceased, but our reporting team reached out to see</p>
<p>if anyone still operating his farm wanted to provide a statement on his behalf.</p>
<p>But we didn&rsquo;t hear back.</p>
<p>For investigators today, their big break will come if they can find a match to Randy&rsquo;s</p>
<p>genetic profile through databases of unidentified remains.</p>
<p>The chances of him still being alive are slim, at least in law enforcement&rsquo;s mind.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s either going to be science that helps explain what happened to Randy, or it will</p>
<p>take someone who knows something to come forward.</p>
<p>If you think you had any interaction with Randy Leach in the fall of 1980 during his</p>
<p>travels in the American West, the Sheboygan County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office in Wisconsin urges</p>
<p>you to call them at 920-459-3111.</p>
