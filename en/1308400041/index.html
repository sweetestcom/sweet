    <p>Hi friends this week we&rsquo;re talking about self-control and I&rsquo;m gonna give it to you straight as I always do I&rsquo;m gay</p>
<p>But I give it straight</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m here to share all the shit</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve learned the hard way cuz I&rsquo;ve read over a hundred self-help books and I&rsquo;m not being dramatic like I read a lot and this</p>
<p>Is everything I&rsquo;ve found that&rsquo;s not in the books. Okay, this is the shit</p>
<p>No one teaches you and no one tells you and y&rsquo;all know everything I share in my podcasts and my posts online is</p>
<p>Everything that I couldn&rsquo;t find when I was suffering so all the answers all the explanations all the help</p>
<p>I was looking for that. No one could give me I had to learn shit by going through it</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m here to share it with you. I&rsquo;m here to give you the answers that I couldn&rsquo;t find</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s kick this off</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna give you a couple of realizations and then we&rsquo;re gonna go deep and then deeper into it as we usually do</p>
<p>Okay, so first things first</p>
<p>making the decision to do something and</p>
<p>Actually doing it are two different things</p>
<p>Completely separate and if you decide to do something without putting your actions behind it</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s useless like you&rsquo;re wasting your fucking time deciding what you want to do and what you want to try like</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s nice and it feels good to think of new ideas and things you want to try things you want to do</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like all these things sound nice and okay</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna do it and then when you don&rsquo;t follow through with it all the energy you just spent deciding to do it is a</p>
<p>waste</p>
<p>So the people that are scared of wasting time</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s your first thing you could stop fucking doing is agreeing and deciding to do things that you know, you&rsquo;re not actually gonna do</p>
<p>Okay</p>
<p>so now that we got that cleared up I&rsquo;m gonna make you aware of the next thing you need to know and it&rsquo;s that</p>
<p>You are in control of every action you take</p>
<p>Because every action you take is a decision you have to decide to take an action or not</p>
<p>Take it like you don&rsquo;t just like walk around and like shit just happens like you decide to act or you decide not to act</p>
<p>But the thing to get with that is you&rsquo;re making decisions on the actions you take all day long</p>
<p>Even if you&rsquo;re on autopilot and you&rsquo;ve just done the same shit over and over you&rsquo;re still deciding to take those actions</p>
<p>So with the actions you take every day</p>
<p>There are consequences good and bad for every action you take and the main thing that helped me shift my mindset around all of this</p>
<p>is</p>
<p>Understanding that I am choosing my consequences all day every day with every action I take</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m in full control</p>
<p>Over my actions and I get to choose to take actions that are in line with what I want or not in line with</p>
<p>It it&rsquo;s up to me. But whenever you want to start doing something new or something different</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of a pain in the ass because you&rsquo;re used to how it feels to choose certain</p>
<p>Consequences like if there&rsquo;s things that you normally do and you normally live your life a certain way</p>
<p>For you to choose to do something different</p>
<p>It brings up a whole new set of feelings because you&rsquo;re used to feeling the way that you&rsquo;re used to choosing</p>
<p>So when you choose something new or something different</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna feel a lot different and a lot of people freak the fuck out because like oh my god</p>
<p>No different is bad</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re just uncomfortable with it and it&rsquo;s just new just because a feeling is new or different does not make it bad</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just not comfortable with it yet. Okay, but back to choosing your consequences</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna give you a couple examples because I sure as fuck needed some when I was trying to learn how to have self-control</p>
<p>Okay, so, you know when your sleep schedule is bad and you&rsquo;ve decided like at night you&rsquo;re like, oh my god tomorrow</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna start waking up early. I&rsquo;m gonna wake up at 7 a.m</p>
<p>I would say 6 but that&rsquo;s too fucking early for me sevens pushing it, but I begin up at 730</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re gonna be excited at night because you&rsquo;re gonna be like, oh my god. I&rsquo;m gonna get so much done tomorrow</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna wake up early. I&rsquo;m gonna be so productive. I have all these things</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m choosing to do all these things I want to do that are gonna improve my life</p>
<p>But when the morning comes that&rsquo;s a whole different motherfucker that whole inspired and happy and excited person</p>
<p>Died when you went to sleep because you wake up in the morning. You&rsquo;re like man, fuck this shit</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s the feeling state you&rsquo;re used to you&rsquo;re used to being in the bed and sleeping in or snoozing or</p>
<p>Not waking up when you said you&rsquo;re gonna wake up</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s gonna be uncomfortable to get out of bed like who the fuck wants to get up when they&rsquo;re tired</p>
<p>No one</p>
<p>But that whole list of things that you decided was you were gonna do with your day and was gonna make everything better and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>Gonna be so productive when your alarm goes off in the morning right there. You are faced with a decision</p>
<p>you are gonna take an action and choose to wake up and go in the direction of what you want or</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna choose to stay in bed and discard everything that you want</p>
<p>But you have to understand staying in bed is your choice</p>
<p>So you can choose to stay in the bed and choose the consequences that come with that which is having a fucked-up sleep schedule</p>
<p>Not getting the shit done. You said you were gonna get done delaying your day waking up with a sense of regret</p>
<p>Those are all the consequences you can choose and you choose to keep your ass in bed or you can get up and choose all</p>
<p>Of the positive consequences that come with getting up early</p>
<p>But at the same time as you&rsquo;re choosing all the good things you still have to choose the consequence of feeling tired</p>
<p>Which one do you want to choose?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s literally a choice with everything you decide to do and when you lay it out in front of yourself like that like choose</p>
<p>Which thing do you want and which set of consequences do you want?</p>
<p>Which one do you prefer?</p>
<p>Laying it out like that in front of me and like imagining putting each option in my hands like it makes it very clear</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a choice. I&rsquo;m like, okay</p>
<p>Which one do I want to choose and then I choose it</p>
<p>But when you put it in front of your face, like it&rsquo;s a choice instead of saying oh, I just can&rsquo;t get up</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so tired. That&rsquo;s bullshit</p>
<p>You are fully in control whether you get up or not</p>
<p>Cuz if I come in your fucking room and I light your room on fire, what are you gonna do?</p>
<p>Are you gonna lay in bed? Oh, I just can&rsquo;t get up. Oh my no, I&rsquo;m just tired. I just can&rsquo;t get up</p>
<p>No, bitch, you&rsquo;re gonna get up and take off running. Look at you all of a sudden out of bed</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s your choice if you get up or not</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s your choice if you take the actions that are in line with what you want</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the first thing to get but I&rsquo;m someone with a really weird relationship to complaining</p>
<p>Like I don&rsquo;t want to hear a fucking word out of someone&rsquo;s mouth if they&rsquo;re choosing</p>
<p>Against what they want like you don&rsquo;t get to whine</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t get to ignore your alarm and sleep in and not get up and do what you said</p>
<p>You were gonna do and then sit there and complain and bitch and whine that you have a bad sleep schedule. Oh my god</p>
<p>No, you don&rsquo;t get to fucking complain</p>
<p>I only allow myself to complain while I&rsquo;m moving toward and choosing the consequences</p>
<p>I want so I only let myself complain when I get up early and I&rsquo;m tired and I&rsquo;m fucking pissed and I&rsquo;m like working</p>
<p>Toward what I need to work toward that&rsquo;s gonna improve my life. That&rsquo;s when I&rsquo;ll let myself complain</p>
<p>I make myself shut the fuck up if I&rsquo;m choosing against what I want</p>
<p>So if I stay in the bed and I wake up late one day and I&rsquo;m like, oh my god, I shut myself up</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like shut up and get your fucking day done now. Okay? Okay. So my next example of choosing consequences is</p>
<p>When you decide that you want to start eating healthy and you want to change the way that you look whether it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Gain weight lose weight, whatever it is every single time you go to have food and you go to eat</p>
<p>You are making a choice of which consequences you want</p>
<p>You can choose food that is gonna like if I want to lose weight</p>
<p>I can choose to eat food that is going to allow me to lose weight or I can choose to eat food</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s gonna fucking make me gain weight</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s my choice each time but there are consequences positive and negative for both when I choose the good food</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, okay</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m choosing to have a good body in like a couple of weeks like I&rsquo;m gonna look better</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna feel better</p>
<p>But I might be a little hungry after I&rsquo;m done eat and I&rsquo;m not like fully satisfied and maybe it didn&rsquo;t taste as good</p>
<p>Cuz I really want a goddamn cheeseburger, but I&rsquo;m over here with my chicken and broccoli</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a negative consequence that comes with this decision is being a little hungry and then not tasting as good as you want</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t get that immediate gratification and especially when you&rsquo;re upset bitch cuz I get that like when I&rsquo;m upset</p>
<p>Kitchen watch out. I&rsquo;m ready to tear it up</p>
<p>But if you flip it and you look at what choosing the bad food is gonna do</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna make you gain weight or stay at the current weight that you&rsquo;re at. You&rsquo;re gonna feel like shit</p>
<p>You will feel full you will feel satisfied</p>
<p>Then you&rsquo;re gonna feel that fucking guilt because you just threw away your fucking goals and you chose</p>
<p>Against what you&rsquo;re saying that you want</p>
<p>the other consequence is slowing yourself down and holding yourself back and</p>
<p>Losing trust with yourself because you&rsquo;re not doing what you said you wanted to do</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m gonna talk about trusting yourself and a whole different episode</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not gonna get too much into it in this one</p>
<p>But you see how there&rsquo;s consequences good and bad for both decisions</p>
<p>You have to choose which ones you want like every decision has good and bad consequences</p>
<p>Just pick the one that&rsquo;s most fucking like beneficial. They both suck</p>
<p>But only one is gonna get you toward what you want. So choose that one another example</p>
<p>I can give to you about this is choosing to leave a job because when I was a nurse I was so fucking scared to</p>
<p>Quit my job and I was so worried but I had to face the reality of the situation</p>
<p>I was in and then see the consequences of choosing to stay or choosing to leave so choosing to stay</p>
<p>Working as a nurse when I fucking didn&rsquo;t like it and working at this certain hospital. I was at I did not like it</p>
<p>I hated my life</p>
<p>I was eating fucking Xanax and trying to meditate in my car before my shifts like I don&rsquo;t meditate</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s saying something but the consequence of staying at my job</p>
<p>I was in was I felt like I was limiting myself. I hated my fucking life. I was miserable</p>
<p>I did not want to go to work. It started to impact my personal life and like my time away from work</p>
<p>I was miserable</p>
<p>dreading that I only had three days off before I had to go back to work again because I would have to work three 12-hour</p>
<p>Shifts in a row and I fucking hated it and I was working night shift</p>
<p>But there were also positive consequences that came with that job and staying in that job so I had job security</p>
<p>I already knew the people I worked with I had precepted there. So I was already familiar with everything. I knew the hospital</p>
<p>I knew all the operating systems. I was comfortable. I was safe. It was secure. It was consistent</p>
<p>I could work there until I died and have retirement and have everything set up</p>
<p>So there was a sense of stability that came with staying at that job, but there was also the negative</p>
<p>So there was positive and negative consequences and then when I looked at leaving the job, I had to face those consequences</p>
<p>There was positive and negatives. I can find a job that I like more. I can do something where I don&rsquo;t want to fucking kill myself</p>
<p>I can go somewhere where I don&rsquo;t feel like I&rsquo;m just a warm body filling a spot</p>
<p>I can go where I actually feel valued and be able to actually contribute and be of use in</p>
<p>The specific way that I can do it. Like I&rsquo;m able to provide things that are more than just</p>
<p>Physically nursing someone and like charting and fucking dealing with that bullshit like please but then you flip it and I also have the</p>
<p>consequences of</p>
<p>No more consistent money. No stability. I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m gonna do next. I don&rsquo;t have anything lined up</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know the people I&rsquo;m gonna work with next. I don&rsquo;t even know the fucking job</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna have next so there&rsquo;s a lot of fear and anxiety</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a lot of feeling states inside this that are a negative consequence like being unsure feeling unstable feeling scared</p>
<p>There was a lot of things I was feeling that were considered negative and scary on this side</p>
<p>but I was faced with the decision which consequences do I want to choose and</p>
<p>It was up to me because each side came with positives and negatives my ass chose to fucking leave</p>
<p>Cuz I played the tape forward</p>
<p>I was like, okay</p>
<p>If I make myself stay in this job nursing at this hospital that I fucking hate</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to decline my health my mental state my life. I&rsquo;m not gonna live a life</p>
<p>I enjoy so it&rsquo;s basically like sacrificing my life as I know it or the life that I could potentially have</p>
<p>Sacrificing it for this just because it&rsquo;s stable. Fuck that you did not come to this life</p>
<p>To die safely. We&rsquo;re all gonna fucking die</p>
<p>So don&rsquo;t play it safe until you get to death like honestly take your fucking risks</p>
<p>But don&rsquo;t try and come at me when you fuck your own shit up</p>
<p>You have to be self-controlled, but let&rsquo;s go into the next part of this</p>
<p>So the biggest thing with self-control is you have to prepare not to feel like it</p>
<p>Do you think I want to wake the fuck up early in the morning?</p>
<p>Do you think I want to listen to audiobooks?</p>
<p>Do you fucking think I want to eat chicken and broccoli and eggs?</p>
<p>No, bitch. Hell fucking no. There are some times where I&rsquo;m like, yes, I feel good about this</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s other times where I&rsquo;m like, this is the last fucking thing</p>
<p>I want to do like literally like waking up this morning</p>
<p>I was like shoot me before you make me get up in this bed</p>
<p>Like just put me out euthanize me bullets to the head. I don&rsquo;t care. I just don&rsquo;t want to get up</p>
<p>You know what I did</p>
<p>I still got the fuck up</p>
<p>But there are times where I feel inspired and I hop up out of bed</p>
<p>Then there are days where I&rsquo;m like just leave me to die like your feelings are gonna be all over the fucking board</p>
<p>So you cannot rely on feeling like it to do what you need to do</p>
<p>And one thing I want to reassure you about is no one makes good decisions all the time</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s impossible to do that. We all fuck up</p>
<p>We all make mistakes</p>
<p>but I am gonna teach you in the trust in yourself episode how to repair that and what to do when you do fuck up</p>
<p>And choose like against what you were trying to do, you know</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna get to that but your feelings are very inconsistent like one day you&rsquo;re gonna feel like it one day</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not I&rsquo;m at the point where like every couple of hours</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be feeling like you&rsquo;re not feeling like it like the more aware you get and the more in touch with your feelings you</p>
<p>Get the more sporadic and unpredictable your feeling states are gonna be so for me to sit here and be like I&rsquo;m gonna rely on</p>
<p>My feelings to dictate if I do or don&rsquo;t do something</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s living my life as a fucking victim</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m just gonna fall prey to like the way that I&rsquo;m feeling the way you feel you can&rsquo;t control</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m just gonna sit here and just</p>
<p>throw all of my power into my feelings where I can&rsquo;t control if I&rsquo;m gonna feel like it or not and let that determine if</p>
<p>I do things or not do things get fucked get fucked my life got to the worst point</p>
<p>When I allowed that to happen</p>
<p>but the thing that completely flipped everything and like made me have my life the way it is like ground struggling as fuck before but like</p>
<p>Flipping and stop relying on your emotions to dictate if you&rsquo;re gonna do shit or not</p>
<p>Stop waiting to feel like it and stop not doing things because you don&rsquo;t feel like it</p>
<p>You can be tired and still get out of bed</p>
<p>You can be hungry and still not eat like you just gotta master that and the way you can do that is by realizing</p>
<p>Your feelings are unreliable</p>
<p>But there is something that is reliable and that you have full control over and that is your actions</p>
<p>You are fully capable and in control of every action you take it&rsquo;s your decision to act or not</p>
<p>So like I said, if you&rsquo;re hungry, you can choose to act on the way that you feel or act in alignment with your goals</p>
<p>You can choose to eat or choose not to eat</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re in full control of your actions</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re tired, you can choose to stay in bed or you can choose to get your fucking ass up</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s so much freedom and realizing your actions are the only thing reliable your feelings</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re great for like self-discovery and like learning what you need to learn about yourself like self-awareness and shit</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re not good to rely on</p>
<p>For dictating your actions like just don&rsquo;t rely on them like your actions are the only thing you can rely on</p>
<p>So show yourself you can rely on yourself by taking the actions</p>
<p>You know you need to take whether you feel like it or not complain on the way, babe</p>
<p>So look at it is like climbing a mountain getting to your goals is like climbing a mountain</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t sit at the bottom and bitch and whine</p>
<p>Bitch and whine as you&rsquo;re climbing like I&rsquo;m tired. I&rsquo;m a Sam thirsty</p>
<p>Like as you&rsquo;re going up the mountain allow yourself to complain as you climb if you&rsquo;re sitting still at the bottom shut the fuck up</p>
<p>Literally shut up because you&rsquo;re choosing to stay there</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s in your full control if you hop on that mountain and start climbing or if you stand there and bitch and whine it&rsquo;s in</p>
<p>Your control and you look dumb because I&rsquo;m up the mountain looking at you like</p>
<p>pendeja</p>
<p>But there is a certain mental state that you&rsquo;re in where you convince yourself</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t do something because of the way that you feel like I have been incredibly</p>
<p>heartbroken and</p>
<p>I like didn&rsquo;t want to get up off the floor</p>
<p>but in my weakest moments, I</p>
<p>force myself to get the fuck up because like I said if you&rsquo;re heartbroken and you&rsquo;re like laying in the floor just like</p>
<p>Wailing like crying and just like boo-hooing and like you&rsquo;re in the most emotional pain</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve ever been in if I walk in the room and light it on fire your fight-or-flight mode will kick on</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re all of a sudden gonna stop crying and your main priority is your sense of safety you&rsquo;re able to get up and</p>
<p>Take care of yourself so you can tap into that in any moment. It does not matter how much pain you&rsquo;re in</p>
<p>It does not matter how difficult something seems you can still do it</p>
<p>I promise I would not be sitting here preaching this shit if it wasn&rsquo;t true</p>
<p>I am giving preacher in this fucking Zephyr shirt</p>
<p>Speaking of if you like this shirt, I&rsquo;m actually sponsored by the brand so use code Leo if you want to shop</p>
<p>They have a lot of cool shit, but I promise you</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re capable of so much more than you realize and you&rsquo;re only gonna learn that</p>
<p>by</p>
<p>Doing shit like you are able to withstand a lot more than you think</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a lot more capable and a lot stronger than you think when you have to be</p>
<p>So if you understand if it&rsquo;s life or death I can do it</p>
<p>I can choose at any moment to do it or not to do it. Like you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re fucking strong</p>
<p>I promise like you&rsquo;ve literally got this you&rsquo;re watching this podcast episode because you&rsquo;re committed to growing yourself</p>
<p>All right, like my podcast is not for the weak</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re already of ahead of a lot of people</p>
<p>but I want to give you that reassurance and set you free from that mentally because I was trapped there for so long and this</p>
<p>Is the shit that I wish someone would have told me like just sucker punch me in the fucking head with all this information</p>
<p>Thanks, like oh if I could have just like read one</p>
<p>Self-help book and it had all this shit in it. I would never have bought another one</p>
<p>Okay. So now I want to get really deep</p>
<p>about this topic because this is</p>
<p>Like all the everything I&rsquo;ve talked about before it was great and a big key</p>
<p>But the next thing I&rsquo;m gonna talk about is the piece of awareness like I always say awareness is a curse</p>
<p>Awareness is a fucking bitch like it&rsquo;s great</p>
<p>But like once you become aware of something you have to change everything you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t just continue doing what you were doing once you&rsquo;re aware of more things like it becomes more difficult</p>
<p>So this is the thing that truly</p>
<p>Helped me become more self-controlled and this is taking yourself into consideration</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m gonna have to give you like a physical analogy because this is how it works in my brain</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s give the example of the part of me that wants to get in shape</p>
<p>So I will literally envision the part of me that wants to get in shape</p>
<p>Like I always do it as like a kid because it&rsquo;s so much easier to care about a kid than like an adult</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why that&rsquo;s just how society is and that&rsquo;s how I am. Like I have a very very</p>
<p>Big heart when it comes to children in my priority. I&rsquo;ll do anything to protect a kid but</p>
<p>Envisioning like a small me like a little me that wants to get in shape</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, okay</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s little me that wants to have a good body and like be cute and be attractive and be healthy like I have to throw</p>
<p>The be healthy in there too because like if I only worry about my appearance, I&rsquo;m an asshole</p>
<p>But I will envision this part of me that wants to get in shape. He has feelings. He has his own feelings</p>
<p>He has his own emotions. He has his own desires and his desire is he wants to get in shape. So</p>
<p>Now that I&rsquo;m aware of this part of me that wants to be in shape</p>
<p>for me to take actions that</p>
<p>Prevent me from getting in shape or sabotage me from getting in shape. I have to discard him to do it</p>
<p>I have to tell him shut the fuck up and go away. It&rsquo;s not about you. I don&rsquo;t care what you want</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m doing what I want</p>
<p>So when I&rsquo;m in the kitchen, and I&rsquo;m like, I really don&rsquo;t want to eat chicken and broccoli right now. Like I&rsquo;m upset</p>
<p>I really just want to fucking binge in order for me to binge. I have to throw him away</p>
<p>I have to tell him shut the fuck up</p>
<p>What you want is not important and like discard him to be able to go eat bad</p>
<p>So the way that I handle this part of me with every decision I make is I bring him to the table</p>
<p>I look at it like a conference table. Not a dining table because I&rsquo;m not fucking doing that</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a little council like okay</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m here to make decisions and I&rsquo;m here to talk at this conference table about what I&rsquo;m gonna do next and</p>
<p>Becoming aware of that part of me. I have to bring him to the table when I&rsquo;m deciding which actions to take</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to discard him. I want to make sure he gets what he wants to because I want it to like</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s just one part of me and one of my desires but to give him what he wants is giving me what I want at</p>
<p>The same time. So when I&rsquo;m coming to like my council table, and I&rsquo;m like, I&rsquo;m gonna go decide to eat right now. I</p>
<p>Bring him to the table with me and I like put my arm around him and I say what he wants is important, too</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re gonna make a decision that gets me what I want and him what he wants like we&rsquo;re all in this together</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not gonna just discard him and go eat. What the fuck I want</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna make sure he&rsquo;s taken care of and that he&rsquo;s considered</p>
<p>So look at it as bringing the part of you that wants something into consideration</p>
<p>With every action you take get at the council table and bring that part of you to the table and sit them next to you</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re no longer discarded. You no longer throw yourself away. This topic gets me so like</p>
<p>passionate I have the chills like I&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>This shit is like where you really transform your life and this is how you actually become self-controlled</p>
<p>Because this is what did it for me like all the other shit that I&rsquo;ve tried. It&rsquo;s like cutesy fun, whatever</p>
<p>but this is the thing that</p>
<p>Really made it work and be consistent because you&rsquo;ll try a lot of shit and it&rsquo;s cute for a minute and it wears off</p>
<p>but understanding that I have to take parts of me into consideration and</p>
<p>Not just discard them when I choose to take certain actions is so so important</p>
<p>So now you&rsquo;re probably thinking well Leo how to drive your fucking truck another time. I&rsquo;m recording my podcast. I</p>
<p>Already beat the fuck out of somebody this week</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t do it like a bunch of times, but I know somebody&rsquo;s gonna point out my knuckles and ask questions</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m gonna go ahead and acknowledge it I</p>
<p>Got into an altercation with someone</p>
<p>two days ago some thug ran up on me at the gas station and</p>
<p>Thought he was gonna get some money out of me</p>
<p>And when he didn&rsquo;t he turned around and kicked the fuck out of my car like girl</p>
<p>Just turn around and just full-throttle kick my fucking car</p>
<p>Okay</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny. I&rsquo;m talking about this and self-control at the same time because I</p>
<p>Chose to beat the fucking shit out of him for multiple reasons and I&rsquo;m not justifying</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just giving you an explanation because I&rsquo;m not above violence because violence is a form of communication</p>
<p>Communication is a scale</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m able to have very high level conversations or I can come down and meet you at the level of violence and beat the</p>
<p>Fuck out of you. Some people are not able to hear and understand things. They need to be shown</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like when a dog but you have a puppy and it&rsquo;s shitting in the house. You can look at it and yell at it</p>
<p>Hey</p>
<p>Stop shitting in the house. Stop shitting in the house. It does not understand</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not the way it knows how to like perceive information and communicate</p>
<p>So you have to smack it on its little fucking ass when it shits in the house</p>
<p>So I realize oh, maybe I shouldn&rsquo;t shit in the house because there&rsquo;s consequences for it</p>
<p>People are the same level of fucking dumb. Sometimes they don&rsquo;t understand</p>
<p>So like I said, I can communicate at a very high level</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m also equipped to talk to you on the level that I need to to get the information relayed</p>
<p>But with this situation, I used to be very violent in my past</p>
<p>like I grew up getting bullied and I was like</p>
<p>the one that everybody was harassing and bullying and beating the shit out of and I would beg people to stop and I would hope</p>
<p>and I would pray and no one ever stopped it only stopped the day that I had enough and I flipped and I just started a</p>
<p>Brutally attacking people who would fuck with me</p>
<p>Like I had to become my own protector because I was literally begging for help and no one would help me</p>
<p>No one would stop the people that were doing shit to me would not stop. So a protector aspect of me was built and</p>
<p>that aspect</p>
<p>Has never gone away and will never go away and whenever I get scared</p>
<p>The protector aspect of me comes out and it&rsquo;s there to take over</p>
<p>so in this situation with the guy like yeah, you kicked my car and</p>
<p>I should smack the fuck out of you for it. But the real reason I attacked him was</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t kick it and walk away. He kicked it and started getting aggressive like it could go somewhere</p>
<p>So he had a hoodie on and my initial thought is</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing in his hands already scanned him and I&rsquo;m like if he&rsquo;s got something on him</p>
<p>I need to get him before he can pull it knife gun, whatever</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna fucking be so my protector aspect kicked the fuck in and I was like scared when I get scared. I&rsquo;m very very</p>
<p>violent and aggressive like that&rsquo;s one thing that I&rsquo;m still learning to</p>
<p>Kick but I fear nothing, but I&rsquo;m scared of a lot</p>
<p>like I get startled easy and whenever I feel like there&rsquo;s a threat to my safety I</p>
<p>Throw caution to the wind and I chose in that situation to get him before he could potentially get me</p>
<p>But honestly he had a fucking come into him</p>
<p>But I promise you he ain&rsquo;t gonna fucking kick nobody&rsquo;s shit again because after I beat the fuck out of him</p>
<p>I started stomping on his legs. You ain&rsquo;t kicking a fuck thing no more, dude</p>
<p>You learn the hard way I</p>
<p>Communicated with you at the level you need it not get fucked and then I peeled out of there cuz I don&rsquo;t fuck with no</p>
<p>Cops, I don&rsquo;t call no cops. I don&rsquo;t do no shit like that. I got out of there. I&rsquo;m Albanian</p>
<p>Okay, so that fucking derailed, but I did want to give you guys an explanation. Y&rsquo;all my friends y&rsquo;all get it</p>
<p>We understand each other</p>
<p>Okay, so let&rsquo;s get back on track. Let&rsquo;s get back on to the self-help and the self-control</p>
<p>So knowing what actions you should take</p>
<p>Just ask yourself with any situation</p>
<p>What action is gonna get me closer to what I want?</p>
<p>What action is in support and in contribution to me getting what I want?</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna be different for every situation and it&rsquo;s gonna change as</p>
<p>You want new things and try new things and as you handle new situations?</p>
<p>But the way that I always find out what I need to do or what I should do when I&rsquo;m a little confused or I</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t know what the fuck to choose. I&rsquo;m like, I&rsquo;m stressed. I&rsquo;m upset like I&rsquo;m emotional</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not logical right now. Like I have to ask myself the logical question. Okay, it&rsquo;s not about how I feel</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s what is gonna get me closer to my goals and no matter how I feel I know if I choose that action</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still moving forward</p>
<p>toward what I want and</p>
<p>Co-creating with universe. I don&rsquo;t like all that fucking spiritual shit, but like I&rsquo;m co-creating with universe what I want</p>
<p>Okay. So my last tip for self-control is stop doing shit that makes it harder for you to have self-control</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s simple as that like it really fucking is but me a couple weeks ago. Like I</p>
<p>started smoking we like I can&rsquo;t say things on YouTube, but like I</p>
<p>Started like hitting the ganja like I need to go to bed. I</p>
<p>Was smoking to go to sleep and I noticed I get the munchies like a motherfucker</p>
<p>All right, and I can&rsquo;t control myself. Like I have self control over food</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very good at it. But like when I get high</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so much harder to be disciplined like girl the other night. I&rsquo;m on a meal plan</p>
<p>I have a nutrition coach and he like tells me what to eat</p>
<p>I have a full meal plan. All my meals are scheduled and planned and weighed to a fucking tea</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>Other night I got like I got high and I went in to go eat and I had nothing left on my meal plan</p>
<p>I was like, oh my okay, like all I have is green beans</p>
<p>What the fuck am I gonna do some green beans?</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m in there with the munchies eating fucking green beans like an idiot, but then I was like, okay</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m gonna try and outsmart the system</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna keep smoking</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m just gonna save one of my meals for after I smoke so that I can eat and</p>
<p>I tried it a couple of times. I tried it but me when I get high and I start eating</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t stop. Oh, I can stop I can choose to stop but like it&rsquo;s really hard</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like ten times harder to stop eating. So I saved my last meal for after I smoke</p>
<p>And then I would eat and then I would notice I was like running around looking for more shit</p>
<p>Like I was wanting to continue to eat and it made it</p>
<p>Extremely hard to be disciplined and have self-control. So, you know what I did. I</p>
<p>Stopped fucking smoking girl. I&rsquo;ll just go the fuck to bed</p>
<p>Go read a fucking book go fucking fiddle your diddle go do what you got to do</p>
<p>Go your ass to bed. You ain&rsquo;t got a smoke to go sleep</p>
<p>but the main thing with that like it&rsquo;s right in front of me like that&rsquo;s the thing with self-control is</p>
<p>Removing the thing that you want and removing the temptation is not true self-control</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just eliminating your ability to access it when you have it in front of you and you choose</p>
<p>Not to do it. That is self-control</p>
<p>So all these people that are like, oh in the house like throw away all your bad food if you want to diet</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not real self-control. It might help but you&rsquo;re not building true resilience and you&rsquo;re not learning true self-control</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like I know the consequences that come from hitting this and it&rsquo;s sitting in front of me at all times</p>
<p>I can choose to or I can choose not to and I choose not to and that</p>
<p>Builds my trust in myself every time I choose not to and it establishes like more self-control</p>
<p>Because I&rsquo;m like, okay, I controlled myself all these other times</p>
<p>I can do it now to like I can choose not to do it</p>
<p>But facing the consequences like when I see this pin</p>
<p>I see the consequences good and bad that come with it and I choose not to have those consequences</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t hit it, but just stop doing shit. That&rsquo;s gonna make things harder for you to have self-control</p>
<p>So it can take the form of a lot of different things</p>
<p>But also I learned do things to make it easier for you to have self-control because like with my meal plan</p>
<p>If I don&rsquo;t have my shit prepped, I&rsquo;m aggravated. I&rsquo;m pissed off and when I&rsquo;m pissed off I</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m more tempted to make different decisions than the ones I need to make to be in alignment with my goal</p>
<p>So I meal prep I get all my shit ready and prepped and there it&rsquo;s like so when I go in I just make the meal</p>
<p>Real quick everything&rsquo;s prepped and I fucking eat</p>
