    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>where we discuss science</p>
<p>and science-based tools for everyday life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Andrew Huberman,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology</p>
<p>at Stanford School of Medicine.</p>
<p>My guest today is Dr. David Buss.</p>
<p>Dr. Buss is a professor of psychology</p>
<p>at the University of Texas, Austin,</p>
<p>and he is one of the founding members and luminaries</p>
<p>in the field of evolutionary psychology.</p>
<p>Dr. Buss&rsquo;s laboratory is responsible</p>
<p>for understanding the strategies that humans use</p>
<p>to select mates in the short and long-term,</p>
<p>and he is an expert in sex differences in mating strategy.</p>
<p>His laboratory has explored, for instance,</p>
<p>why women cheat on their spouses or their long-term partners,</p>
<p>as well as why men tend to cheat on their spouses</p>
<p>and long-term partners.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s also explored a number of things</p>
<p>related to the courtship dance</p>
<p>that we call dating and securing a mate,</p>
<p>including the use of deception</p>
<p>related to proclamations of love</p>
<p>or promises of finances or sexual activity.</p>
<p>Dr. Buss&rsquo;s laboratory has also evaluated</p>
<p>how status is assessed,</p>
<p>meaning how we evaluate our own worth</p>
<p>and our potential as a mate,</p>
<p>and who is, let&rsquo;s just say,</p>
<p>within range of a potential mate,</p>
<p>both in the short and long-term.</p>
<p>For instance, today we talk about</p>
<p>how people don&rsquo;t just make direct assessments</p>
<p>of their own and other people&rsquo;s value</p>
<p>as a potential mate,</p>
<p>but also using the assessments of others</p>
<p>to indirectly determine whether or not</p>
<p>they stand a chance or not</p>
<p>in securing somebody as a short or long-term mate.</p>
<p>His laboratory has also focused on</p>
<p>some of the complicated and varied emotions</p>
<p>related to mating love in relationships,</p>
<p>such as lust and jealousy,</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s extensively explored something called mate poaching</p>
<p>or the various strategies that men and women use</p>
<p>to make sure that the person that they want to be with</p>
<p>or the person they are with</p>
<p>is not with anyone else or seeking anyone else,</p>
<p>and indeed that other people don&rsquo;t seek their mate.</p>
<p>Dr. Buss&rsquo;s work also relates to how biological influences,</p>
<p>such as ovulation or time within the menstrual cycle,</p>
<p>influences mate selection or tendency to have sex or not</p>
<p>with a potential short or long-term mate.</p>
<p>And more recent work from Dr. Buss&rsquo;s laboratory</p>
<p>focuses on the darker aspects of mating</p>
<p>and sexual behavior in humans,</p>
<p>including stalking and sexual violence.</p>
<p>Today, we discuss all those topics.</p>
<p>We also discuss some of the strategies that humans can use</p>
<p>to make healthy mate selection choices,</p>
<p>and for those that are already in committed relationships,</p>
<p>to ensure healthy progression</p>
<p>of those committed relationships.</p>
<p>In addition to publishing dozens</p>
<p>of landmark scientific studies,</p>
<p>Dr. Buss has authored many important books.</p>
<p>A few of those include</p>
<p>The Evolution of Desire and Why Women Have Sex,</p>
<p>and his most recent book is the one that I&rsquo;m reading now,</p>
<p>which is called When Men Behave Badly,</p>
<p>The Hidden Roots of Sexual Deception,</p>
<p>Harassment, and Assault.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s an absolutely fascinating read.</p>
<p>It has endorsements from Dr. Robert Sapolsky,</p>
<p>professor at Stanford,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s been on this podcast as a guest before,</p>
<p>as well as Steven Pinker and Jonathan Haidt,</p>
<p>who wrote The Coddling of the American Mind.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a really important book, I believe,</p>
<p>and one that doesn&rsquo;t just get into the darker aspects</p>
<p>of human mating behavior and violence,</p>
<p>but also strategies that people can take</p>
<p>to ensure healthy mating behavior and relationships.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so much rumors, speculation,</p>
<p>and outright fabrication of ideas</p>
<p>about why humans select particular mates</p>
<p>in the short and long-term,</p>
<p>what men and women do differently, and so on.</p>
<p>What I love about Dr. Buss&rsquo;s work</p>
<p>is that it&rsquo;s grounded in laboratory studies</p>
<p>that are highly quantitative, using rigorous statistics.</p>
<p>And so throughout today&rsquo;s discussion,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll notice that I&rsquo;m wrapped with attention,</p>
<p>trying to extract as much information as I can</p>
<p>from Dr. Buss about the real science</p>
<p>of human mate selection and mating strategy.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m certain that everyone will take away</p>
<p>extremely valuable knowledge that they can use</p>
<p>in existing or future relationships</p>
<p>from this discussion with Dr. Buss.</p>
<p>Before we begin, I&rsquo;d like to emphasize</p>
<p>that this podcast is separate</p>
<p>from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.</p>
<p>It is, however, part of my desire and effort</p>
<p>to bring zero cost to consumer information</p>
<p>about science and science-related tools</p>
<p>to the general public.</p>
<p>In keeping with that theme,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank the sponsors of today&rsquo;s podcast.</p>
<p>Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens.</p>
<p>Athletic Greens is an all-in-one</p>
<p>vitamin mineral probiotic drink.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been taking Athletic Greens since 2012,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m delighted that they&rsquo;re sponsoring the podcast.</p>
<p>The reason I started taking Athletic Greens</p>
<p>and the reason I still take Athletic Greens</p>
<p>once or twice a day is that it helps me cover</p>
<p>all of my basic nutritional needs.</p>
<p>It makes up for any deficiencies that I might have.</p>
<p>In addition, it has probiotics,</p>
<p>which are vital for microbiome health.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done a couple of episodes now</p>
<p>on the so-called gut microbiome</p>
<p>and the ways in which the microbiome interacts</p>
<p>with your immune system, with your brain to regulate mood,</p>
<p>and essentially with every biological system</p>
<p>relevant to health throughout your brain and body.</p>
<p>With Athletic Greens, I get the vitamins I need,</p>
<p>the minerals I need,</p>
<p>and the probiotics to support my microbiome.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Athletic Greens,</p>
<p>you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>and claim a special offer.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll give you five free travel packs</p>
<p>plus a year supply of vitamin D3 K2.</p>
<p>There are a ton of data now showing that vitamin D3</p>
<p>is essential for various aspects of our brain</p>
<p>and body health.</p>
<p>Even if we&rsquo;re getting a lot of sunshine,</p>
<p>many of us are still deficient in vitamin D3.</p>
<p>And K2 is also important because it regulates things</p>
<p>like cardiovascular function, calcium in the body,</p>
<p>and so on.</p>
<p>Again, go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>to claim the special offer of the five free travel packs</p>
<p>and the year supply of vitamin D3 K2.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Element.</p>
<p>Element is an electrolyte drink</p>
<p>that has everything you need and nothing you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>That means the exact ratios of electrolytes are an element,</p>
<p>and those are sodium, magnesium, and potassium,</p>
<p>but it has no sugar.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked many times before on this podcast</p>
<p>about the key role of hydration and electrolytes</p>
<p>for nerve cell function, neuron function,</p>
<p>as well as the function of all the cells</p>
<p>and all the tissues and organ systems of the body.</p>
<p>If we have sodium, magnesium, and potassium</p>
<p>present in the proper ratios,</p>
<p>all of those cells function properly,</p>
<p>and all our bodily systems can be optimized.</p>
<p>If the electrolytes are not present,</p>
<p>and if hydration is low,</p>
<p>we simply can&rsquo;t think as well as we would otherwise,</p>
<p>our mood is off, hormone systems go off,</p>
<p>our ability to get into physical action,</p>
<p>to engage in endurance and strength,</p>
<p>and all sorts of other things is diminished.</p>
<p>So with Element, you can make sure</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re staying on top of your hydration</p>
<p>and that you&rsquo;re getting the proper ratios of electrolytes.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Element, you can go to drinkelement,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s lmnt.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll get a free Element sample pack</p>
<p>with your purchase.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all delicious.</p>
<p>So again, if you want to try Element,</p>
<p>you can go to elementlmnt.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Thesis.</p>
<p>Thesis makes what are called nootropics,</p>
<p>which means smart drugs.</p>
<p>Now, to be honest, I am not a fan of the term nootropics.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe in smart drugs in the sense that</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe that there&rsquo;s any one substance</p>
<p>or collection of substances that can make us smarter.</p>
<p>I do believe based on science, however,</p>
<p>that there are particular neural circuits</p>
<p>and brain functions that allow us to be more focused,</p>
<p>more alert, access creativity, be more motivated, et cetera.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just the way that the brain works,</p>
<p>different neural circuits for different brain states.</p>
<p>Thesis understands this.</p>
<p>And as far as I know, they&rsquo;re the first nootropics company</p>
<p>to create targeted nootropics for specific outcomes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Thesis for more than six months now,</p>
<p>and I can confidently say that their nootropics</p>
<p>have been a total game changer.</p>
<p>My go-to formula is the clarity formula,</p>
<p>or sometimes I&rsquo;ll use their energy formula before training.</p>
<p>To get your own personalized nootropic starter kit,</p>
<p>go online to takethesis.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>take a three minute quiz,</p>
<p>and Thesis will send you four different formulas</p>
<p>to try in your first month.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s takethesis.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>and use the code Huberman at checkout</p>
<p>for 10% off your first order.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pleased to announce that the Huberman Lab Podcast</p>
<p>is now partnered with Momentus Supplements.</p>
<p>We partnered with Momentus for several important reasons.</p>
<p>First of all, they ship internationally,</p>
<p>because we know that many of you are located</p>
<p>outside of the United States.</p>
<p>Second of all, and perhaps most important,</p>
<p>the quality of their supplements is second to none,</p>
<p>both in terms of purity and precision</p>
<p>of the amounts of the ingredients.</p>
<p>Third, we&rsquo;ve really emphasized supplements</p>
<p>that are single ingredient supplements,</p>
<p>and that are supplied in dosages</p>
<p>that allow you to build a supplementation protocol</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for cost,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for effectiveness,</p>
<p>and that you can add things</p>
<p>and remove things from your protocol</p>
<p>in a way that&rsquo;s really systematic and scientific.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to see the supplements</p>
<p>that we partnered with Momentus on,</p>
<p>you can go to livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>There, you&rsquo;ll see those supplements,</p>
<p>and just keep in mind that we are constantly expanding</p>
<p>the library of supplements available through Momentus</p>
<p>on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>And now my conversation with Dr. David Buss.</p>
<p>Well, David, delighted to be here.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve followed your work for a number of years,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m excited to ask you a number of questions</p>
<p>about these super interesting topics</p>
<p>about how people select mates,</p>
<p>how they lie, cheat, but also behave well</p>
<p>in this dance that we call mate choice.</p>
<p>Yes, yeah.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there are well-behaving humans</p>
<p>in the mix here.</p>
<p>Good to know.</p>
<p>Just to start off,</p>
<p>perhaps you could just orient us a little bit</p>
<p>about mate choice,</p>
<p>some of the primary criteria</p>
<p>that studies show men and women use</p>
<p>in order to select mates,</p>
<p>both, shall we call them transient mates</p>
<p>as well as lifetime mates?</p>
<p>Right, well, that&rsquo;s a critical distinction</p>
<p>because what people look for</p>
<p>in a long-term committed mateship,</p>
<p>like a marriage partner or a long-term romantic relationship,</p>
<p>is different from what people look for</p>
<p>in a hookup or casual sex or one-night stand</p>
<p>or even a brief affair.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s actually critical.</p>
<p>I wonder if we could maybe just back up a second</p>
<p>and just talk a little bit about the theoretical framework</p>
<p>for understanding mate choice.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>So it basically stems from Darwin&rsquo;s theory</p>
<p>of sexual selection.</p>
<p>And most people, when they think about evolution,</p>
<p>they think about cliches like survival of the fittest</p>
<p>or nature red in tooth and claw.</p>
<p>And Darwin noticed that there were phenomena</p>
<p>that couldn&rsquo;t be explained</p>
<p>by this so-called survival selection,</p>
<p>things like the brilliant plumage of peacocks,</p>
<p>sex differences, like in, you know,</p>
<p>stags, for example, have these massive antlers</p>
<p>and the females of the species do not.</p>
<p>And so he came up with the theory of sexual selection,</p>
<p>which deals not with the evolution of characteristics</p>
<p>due to their survival advantage,</p>
<p>but rather due to their mating advantage.</p>
<p>And he identified two causal processes</p>
<p>by which mating advantage could occur.</p>
<p>One is intrasexual competition</p>
<p>with the stereotype being two stags locking horns in combat</p>
<p>with the victor gaining sexual access to the female,</p>
<p>loser ambling off with a broken antler</p>
<p>and dejected and low self-esteem</p>
<p>and needing psychotherapy perhaps</p>
<p>or mate value improvement therapy.</p>
<p>And the logic was whatever qualities led to success</p>
<p>in these same sex battles,</p>
<p>those qualities get passed on in greater numbers.</p>
<p>And so you see evolution, which is change over time</p>
<p>and increase in frequency of the characteristics</p>
<p>associated with winning these,</p>
<p>what Darwin called contest competition.</p>
<p>And we know that the logic of that is more general now</p>
<p>and involves things like in our species competing</p>
<p>for position and status hierarchies.</p>
<p>So anyway, so intrasexual competition is one,</p>
<p>but the second most relevant to your question</p>
<p>about mate choice is preferential mate choice.</p>
<p>That was the second causal pathway.</p>
<p>And the logic there is that if members of one sex</p>
<p>agree with one another, if there&rsquo;s some consensus</p>
<p>about the qualities that are desired,</p>
<p>then those of the opposite sex</p>
<p>who possess the desired qualities</p>
<p>or embody those desired qualities,</p>
<p>they have a mating advantage.</p>
<p>They get chosen, they get preferred.</p>
<p>Those lacking desired qualities get banished, shunned,</p>
<p>ignored, or in the modern environment become incels.</p>
<p>And so the logic there is very simple,</p>
<p>but also very powerful.</p>
<p>And that is that whatever qualities are desired,</p>
<p>consensually desired,</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s some heritable basis to those,</p>
<p>then those increase in frequency over time.</p>
<p>And so, and in the human case,</p>
<p>these two causal processes of sexual selection</p>
<p>are related to each other in that the preferences</p>
<p>of the mate preferences of one sex</p>
<p>basically set the ground rules</p>
<p>for competition in the opposite sex.</p>
<p>So if, for example, hypothetically,</p>
<p>women preferred to mate with men</p>
<p>who were able and willing to devote resources to them,</p>
<p>then that would create competition among men</p>
<p>to claw their way, you know,</p>
<p>and beat out other men in resource acquisition</p>
<p>and then displaying that their willingness</p>
<p>to commit that to a particular woman.</p>
<p>And same with women, though.</p>
<p>And this is one of the interesting things about humans</p>
<p>is that we have mutual mate choice,</p>
<p>which is not true in all species.</p>
<p>So, and that is that it&rsquo;s not just a matter of,</p>
<p>you know, you selecting someone to be your mate,</p>
<p>they have to reciprocally select you.</p>
<p>And so with mutual mate choice,</p>
<p>we have both preferences,</p>
<p>mate preferences that women have</p>
<p>and mate preferences that men have,</p>
<p>and consequently competition among men</p>
<p>for access to the most desirable women</p>
<p>and competition among women</p>
<p>for access to the most desirable man.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s sort of a little bit of theoretical backdrop.</p>
<p>So you asked, well, what are the qualities</p>
<p>that men and women desire?</p>
<p>And maybe we&rsquo;ll start with long-term mating</p>
<p>and then shift to short-term mating.</p>
<p>And long-term mating is interesting in and of itself</p>
<p>in that it&rsquo;s very rare in the mammalian world.</p>
<p>So there are more than 5,000 species of primates,</p>
<p>of which, I&rsquo;m sorry, more than 5,000 species of mammals</p>
<p>of which we are one.</p>
<p>But the percentage of mammals that have anything resembling</p>
<p>like a pair-bonded long-term mating strategy,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s about three to 5%.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s extremely rare.</p>
<p>And even our closest primate relatives, the chimpanzees,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t have a long-term mating strategy.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t have anything resembling pair-bonded mating.</p>
<p>In the chimps, the females come into estrus.</p>
<p>Almost all the sexual activity occurs</p>
<p>during the estrus phase.</p>
<p>After that, males and females basically ignore each other</p>
<p>for the most part, with some exceptions.</p>
<p>But with humans, you have the evolution</p>
<p>of long-term pair-bonding, attachment,</p>
<p>heavy male investment in offspring,</p>
<p>relatively concealed ovulation.</p>
<p>And so these are kind of unique aspects</p>
<p>of the human mating system.</p>
<p>So to get to your question,</p>
<p>so well, what are the qualities?</p>
<p>So the best, the most large-scale study</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s been done on this is a study that I did a while back</p>
<p>of 37 different cultures.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s now been replicated by other researchers.</p>
<p>But basically what we found is three clusters of things.</p>
<p>We found qualities that both men and women wanted</p>
<p>in a long-term mate.</p>
<p>We found some qualities that were sex-differentiated,</p>
<p>where women preferred them more than men,</p>
<p>or men preferred them more than women.</p>
<p>And then we found some attributes</p>
<p>that were highly variable across cultures</p>
<p>in whether people found these as desirable</p>
<p>or indispensable or irrelevant in a mate.</p>
<p>And so I could give examples of each of these, if that.</p>
<p>Yeah, that would be great.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to know what some of the common themes were</p>
<p>across these cultures,</p>
<p>in terms of what&rsquo;s being mate and sexually selected for.</p>
<p>Yeah, so some of the things that were,</p>
<p>so if you talk about universal desire,</p>
<p>so things that men and women share,</p>
<p>there are things like intelligence, kindness,</p>
<p>mutual attraction and love,</p>
<p>which is really kind of heartwarming</p>
<p>because some people think that love</p>
<p>is a recent Western invention by some European poets.</p>
<p>But it turns out it&rsquo;s not true.</p>
<p>You go to the Klungsan in Botswana,</p>
<p>and they describe pretty much the same experience</p>
<p>as a falling in love as we do,</p>
<p>and even describe the distinction</p>
<p>between this kind of infatuation stage of love</p>
<p>and the attachment phase,</p>
<p>where you can&rsquo;t maintain this frenzy of infatuation</p>
<p>and obsession for very long,</p>
<p>six weeks, maybe six months at most.</p>
<p>Otherwise, you can get nothing else done in your life.</p>
<p>Yeah, those are those dopamine circuits</p>
<p>firing at high frequency.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, so mutual attraction, love, good health,</p>
<p>dependability, emotional stability,</p>
<p>although there&rsquo;s a bit of a sex difference there</p>
<p>with women preferring it a bit more than men.</p>
<p>And so basically, and these may seem obvious,</p>
<p>so no one wants a stupid, mean, ugly, disease-ridden mate.</p>
<p>So perhaps obvious, but no one knew this</p>
<p>in advance of the 37 Culture Study.</p>
<p>So these were some universal preferences.</p>
<p>So you go to the Zulu tribe in South Africa,</p>
<p>or Rio de Janeiro in Brazil,</p>
<p>or Portugal, or Oslo, or anywhere in the world,</p>
<p>and these are qualities that people universally desire</p>
<p>in long-term mates.</p>
<p>Sex differences.</p>
<p>So sex differences basically fell into two clusters.</p>
<p>So women more than men prioritized good earning capacity,</p>
<p>slightly older age,</p>
<p>and the qualities associated with resource acquisition.</p>
<p>So these are things like a man&rsquo;s social status.</p>
<p>Does he have drive?</p>
<p>Is he ambitious?</p>
<p>Does he have a good long-term resource trajectory</p>
<p>is one way that I like to phrase it,</p>
<p>because women often, they don&rsquo;t look at necessarily</p>
<p>the resources that a guy possesses at this moment,</p>
<p>but what is his trajectory?</p>
<p>And so-</p>
<p>Just sorry to interrupt, but may I ask,</p>
<p>is there anything known about the commonalities</p>
<p>of how that is assessed?</p>
<p>You know, is it, you know,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s rolling out of bed early and running eight miles.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s showing proficiency in school.</p>
<p>He handles himself well socially at parties,</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t drinking too much, but knows when, you know,</p>
<p>I mean, obviously they&rsquo;re integrating multiple cues.</p>
<p>The brain is a complex place,</p>
<p>but is there any information about</p>
<p>what those variables are across cultures?</p>
<p>Yeah, well, I think that</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s been less attention to that.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a great question.</p>
<p>One of the things that we do know across cultures</p>
<p>is that women attend to the attention structure.</p>
<p>So the attention structure is a key determinant of status.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s people who are high in status</p>
<p>or those to whom the most people pay the most attention.</p>
<p>Ah, so the attention of others to them,</p>
<p>not how well a given potential mate</p>
<p>can focus and pay attention necessarily.</p>
<p>Yes, yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>But women, look, I mean, you know,</p>
<p>is the guy, even in the modern environment,</p>
<p>is the guy spending eight hours a day playing video games,</p>
<p>eating Cheetos and drinking beer,</p>
<p>or is he devoting effort to his professional development?</p>
<p>So hard work, ambition, does he have clear goals,</p>
<p>or is he in an existential crisis</p>
<p>not knowing what he&rsquo;s gonna do with his life?</p>
<p>So those are some of the qualities</p>
<p>that people look for.</p>
<p>And also women use what&rsquo;s called in the literature</p>
<p>mate choice copying.</p>
<p>And this is related in part to the attention structure.</p>
<p>That is guys who have passed the filters of multiple women,</p>
<p>those are like pre-approved, pre-approvement.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve done studies where you just take a guy,</p>
<p>photograph him alone versus take the same guy,</p>
<p>put an attractive woman next to him</p>
<p>or put two women next to him,</p>
<p>and women judge exactly the same guy</p>
<p>to be much more attractive if he&rsquo;s paired with women</p>
<p>than if he&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>And some guys exploit this in the modern world</p>
<p>by hiring wing women to go with them on dates and so forth.</p>
<p>This is my sister, former girlfriend or whatever.</p>
<p>So, but you&rsquo;re correct in that women use multiple cues</p>
<p>to assess these things and they change over time.</p>
<p>So in the modern environment,</p>
<p>even things like the attention structure,</p>
<p>does this guy have a million Twitter followers</p>
<p>or three Twitter followers?</p>
<p>So that is an index of the attention structure</p>
<p>and hence the status of the guy</p>
<p>within the broader community.</p>
<p>So, and from an evolutionary perspective,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s reasonable that women would prioritize these qualities</p>
<p>because of the tremendous asymmetry</p>
<p>in our reproductive biology,</p>
<p>namely that fertilization occurs internally within women,</p>
<p>not within men.</p>
<p>Women bear the burdens of the nine month pregnancy,</p>
<p>which is metabolically expensive</p>
<p>as well as creating opportunity costs</p>
<p>in terms of mobility and solving other tasks</p>
<p>that people need to solve in the course of their lives.</p>
<p>And so one way to phrase that is that the costs</p>
<p>of making a bad mate choice are much heavier for women</p>
<p>when it comes to sexual behavior, certainly,</p>
<p>because, and the benefits correspondingly</p>
<p>of making a wise mate choice are higher for women</p>
<p>in the sexual context.</p>
<p>But as I said, we have mutual mate choice in our species.</p>
<p>And so what do men value more than women?</p>
<p>Physical attractiveness.</p>
<p>They rank that as a more important criteria</p>
<p>than do women about men?</p>
<p>Yes, yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>Consistently across cultures.</p>
<p>Consistently, and it&rsquo;s not that women</p>
<p>are indifferent to it.</p>
<p>So women do pay attention to a guy&rsquo;s physical appearance,</p>
<p>his fitness and so forth.</p>
<p>And guys are actually off base in thinking</p>
<p>that women prefer more muscular men than they actually do.</p>
<p>So like in muscle magazines,</p>
<p>these men with bulging biceps and so forth,</p>
<p>women don&rsquo;t find that especially,</p>
<p>but they do prioritize fit men,</p>
<p>a good shoulder to hip ratio</p>
<p>and other qualities of physical appearance,</p>
<p>as well as things like cues to health.</p>
<p>So physical appearance provides a wealth of information</p>
<p>about a person&rsquo;s health status,</p>
<p>but also provides for men a wealth of information</p>
<p>about a woman&rsquo;s fertility, her reproductive value.</p>
<p>Now, not that men think about that consciously.</p>
<p>I mean, you men don&rsquo;t walk down the street</p>
<p>and see a woman and say, oh, I find her attractive</p>
<p>because I think she must be very fertile.</p>
<p>Maybe a few weird people do that,</p>
<p>but most men just, it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>they just find those cues attractive.</p>
<p>And the cues are cues associated with youth and health,</p>
<p>because we know that youth is a very powerful cue</p>
<p>to fertility and reproductive value.</p>
<p>So men prioritize physical appearance.</p>
<p>And in the field of psychology,</p>
<p>it used to, I was taught when I was an undergraduate</p>
<p>that you can&rsquo;t judge a book by its cover,</p>
<p>that physical attractiveness was infinitely arbitrary,</p>
<p>infinitely culturally variable.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s simply not true.</p>
<p>We know now based on the last 20 years of scientific studies</p>
<p>that the cues that men find attractive in women</p>
<p>are not at all arbitrary.</p>
<p>There is some variation across cultures,</p>
<p>like in relative plumpness versus thinness,</p>
<p>but things like clear skin, clear eyes,</p>
<p>symmetrical features, a low waist to hip ratio,</p>
<p>full lips, lustrous hair,</p>
<p>all these are qualities</p>
<p>that are associated with youth and health,</p>
<p>and hence have evolved</p>
<p>to be part of our standards of attractiveness.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s not just that men</p>
<p>are these superficial creatures</p>
<p>who evaluate women on the basis of appearance.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an underlying logic to why they do so.</p>
<p>And as I said, relative youth,</p>
<p>this age thing is one of the largest sex differences</p>
<p>you find in long-term mate selection</p>
<p>with women preferring somewhat older men</p>
<p>and men preferring somewhat younger women.</p>
<p>Is there a consistent age gap to relate to that statement?</p>
<p>Yes, there is.</p>
<p>So the age gap, though, depends on the age of the man.</p>
<p>So we can document this.</p>
<p>So in my studies, what we found is that men preferred women</p>
<p>who were about three to four years younger</p>
<p>than they were on average,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll qualify this in a second.</p>
<p>Women preferred guys who were about three and a half</p>
<p>to four and a half years older than they were.</p>
<p>So there was a sex difference going</p>
<p>in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>But as men get older,</p>
<p>they prefer women who are increasingly younger than they are.</p>
<p>So one way to gauge this,</p>
<p>so there are actual marriage statistics,</p>
<p>and then there are expressed preferences,</p>
<p>and both sexes kind of converge.</p>
<p>So if you look at first marriage,</p>
<p>second marriage, third marriage,</p>
<p>as if people get divorced and remarried,</p>
<p>average age gap is, in America anyway,</p>
<p>is three years at first marriage with the guys being older,</p>
<p>five years at second marriage,</p>
<p>and eight years at third marriage.</p>
<p>So that is, as men are getting older</p>
<p>and getting divorced and remarrying,</p>
<p>they are marrying women</p>
<p>who are increasingly younger than they are.</p>
<p>In terms of preferences,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s also expressed in preferences.</p>
<p>So it doesn&rsquo;t go down,</p>
<p>so like, say, a 25-year-old man</p>
<p>would, say, prefer a woman who&rsquo;s 20 or in her early 20s.</p>
<p>35-year-old man might prefer a woman</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s in her late 20s or early 30s.</p>
<p>50-year-old man might prefer a woman who&rsquo;s, say, 35 to 38.</p>
<p>So the preferences do go up,</p>
<p>but the gap gets increasingly larger.</p>
<p>And the reason that you don&rsquo;t see things like,</p>
<p>why aren&rsquo;t men preferring women?</p>
<p>So peak fertility in humans is around age 24, 25.</p>
<p>And so you say, well, why aren&rsquo;t the 60-year-old men</p>
<p>prioritizing 25-year-old women?</p>
<p>Well, as I mentioned,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a reciprocal, mutual, mate-choice phenomenon.</p>
<p>She constrains the equation.</p>
<p>Well, she constrains it,</p>
<p>but also marriage and long-term mating</p>
<p>are things other than reproductive unions</p>
<p>in the modern environment.</p>
<p>That is, you&rsquo;re supposed to do things as a couple,</p>
<p>and if you get too large an age gap,</p>
<p>then essentially you&rsquo;re in different cultures.</p>
<p>You grow up with different songs</p>
<p>and if the cultural gap gets too large,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t understand each other.</p>
<p>So there are constraints on that.</p>
<p>But if you look at contexts</p>
<p>where there are no constraints of that sort,</p>
<p>so historically kings, emperors, despots, et cetera,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll give one more modern example,</p>
<p>they basically prefer young, fertile, attractive females.</p>
<p>And if they have harems,</p>
<p>they stock the harems with those</p>
<p>and then circulate them out when they&rsquo;re 30 and so forth.</p>
<p>And so if you look at marriage systems</p>
<p>that are unconstrained,</p>
<p>then the preferences are more likely to be revealed.</p>
<p>Or within cultures, that is,</p>
<p>if you look at men who are in a position</p>
<p>to get what they want,</p>
<p>so as Mick Jagger noted,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t always get what you want,</p>
<p>but if you try sometimes, you get what you need.</p>
<p>I hear that most of the time he got what he needed.</p>
<p>Right, right, he got what he wanted.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Yeah, and maybe what he needed.</p>
<p>But he was in a position,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if he still is,</p>
<p>I think he&rsquo;s in his 70s now,</p>
<p>but he was in a position,</p>
<p>as was, let&rsquo;s say, Rod Stewart,</p>
<p>to take another example,</p>
<p>or Leonardo DiCaprio.</p>
<p>If you were a male who&rsquo;s in a position</p>
<p>where there are thousands of women</p>
<p>potentially available to you,</p>
<p>and you can have your pick,</p>
<p>then you see that clearer expression for younger females.</p>
<p>There was a chart that was floating around the internet</p>
<p>of the girlfriends of Leonardo DiCaprio</p>
<p>as he got older,</p>
<p>so he&rsquo;s getting older and older,</p>
<p>and the graph of the age of his girlfriends,</p>
<p>it basically stayed the same,</p>
<p>was in the early, early 20s or so.</p>
<p>He values consistency.</p>
<p>He values consistency.</p>
<p>So anyway, the data converge on that.</p>
<p>So these are universal sex differences</p>
<p>in long-term mate selection.</p>
<p>So now when we shift to,</p>
<p>oh, and I should mention cultural variability,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s a critical thing,</p>
<p>because there is, in my 37 culture study,</p>
<p>what I found was the preference for virginity,</p>
<p>that is, no prior sexual experience,</p>
<p>that was the most variable desire across cultures.</p>
<p>So you had cultures like,</p>
<p>at the time of the study, China,</p>
<p>it was basically indispensable</p>
<p>that a partner be a virgin.</p>
<p>And then at the other end,</p>
<p>you have Sweden, where Sweden,</p>
<p>Swedes typically place close to zero value on it,</p>
<p>and some even find it undesirable,</p>
<p>like, you&rsquo;re weird if you&rsquo;re a virgin.</p>
<p>And so you have this whole spectrum.</p>
<p>This is virginity in the female,</p>
<p>or is this also, this is not,</p>
<p>in China, was it preference</p>
<p>that the male and the female be virgin,</p>
<p>so mutual mate selection?</p>
<p>Yeah, it was a preference for both sexes.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s a good question,</p>
<p>because where there was a sex difference,</p>
<p>it was always in the direction</p>
<p>of males preferring virginity more than females.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve gone back to China,</p>
<p>so I still do research in China,</p>
<p>among other places,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ve gone back</p>
<p>and retested modern urban populations,</p>
<p>and the importance of virginity</p>
<p>has gone down in China,</p>
<p>especially in the urban areas,</p>
<p>and the sex difference</p>
<p>that didn&rsquo;t exist before has now emerged,</p>
<p>where males value it more than females.</p>
<p>And I think part of it was,</p>
<p>in previous times,</p>
<p>you hit ceiling effects,</p>
<p>where both sexes say,</p>
<p>yeah, it&rsquo;s absolutely important to be a virgin.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s cultural variation</p>
<p>and cultural change over time</p>
<p>in some of these qualities.</p>
<p>But the sex differences that I described</p>
<p>have remained invariant over the years.</p>
<p>Since my 37 culture study,</p>
<p>this has been replicated</p>
<p>in at least a couple dozen different cultures,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ve gone back to some of the cultures.</p>
<p>So I mentioned we&rsquo;ve gone back to China,</p>
<p>Brazil, and India</p>
<p>to look at cultural changes over time,</p>
<p>and there have been,</p>
<p>in some cases,</p>
<p>dramatic cultural changes over time,</p>
<p>but the sex differences that I described are invariant.</p>
<p>They haven&rsquo;t changed a bit.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be remiss</p>
<p>if I didn&rsquo;t ask about truth-telling and deception,</p>
<p>because some of the measures that you&rsquo;re describing,</p>
<p>age, for instance,</p>
<p>one can potentially lie about, right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m guessing that there are people</p>
<p>who do that on online profiles and whatnot.</p>
<p>From what I understand,</p>
<p>people also lie about height</p>
<p>and other features on online profiles,</p>
<p>but some of them are much harder to hide, right?</p>
<p>Eventually, the truth comes out about some,</p>
<p>if not all of these things.</p>
<p>So if you would,</p>
<p>could you tell us about how men and women</p>
<p>leverage deception versus truth-telling</p>
<p>and communicating some of the things</p>
<p>around mate choice selection?</p>
<p>Yeah, well, so basically,</p>
<p>both men and women do deceive.</p>
<p>So we have the modern cultural invention of online dating,</p>
<p>which was little used 10 years ago</p>
<p>and virtually absent 20 years ago.</p>
<p>And people do lie,</p>
<p>but they lie in predictable ways.</p>
<p>They lie in ways that attempt to embody</p>
<p>the mate preferences of the person</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re trying to attract.</p>
<p>And so men do lie.</p>
<p>They deceive about their income, their status.</p>
<p>So they exaggerate their income by about 20%.</p>
<p>They tack on about two inches to their height.</p>
<p>So if they&rsquo;re 5'10&quot;, they round up to six feet.</p>
<p>So they don&rsquo;t, like if they&rsquo;re 5'10&quot;,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t say that they&rsquo;re gigantic,</p>
<p>but they kind of round it up</p>
<p>in the more desirable direction.</p>
<p>Women tend to deceive about weight.</p>
<p>So they tend to shave about 15 pounds</p>
<p>off of their reported weight.</p>
<p>And both sexes post photos</p>
<p>that are not truly representative</p>
<p>of what they actually look like.</p>
<p>So they might post photos of themselves</p>
<p>when they were younger,</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;re even advice,</p>
<p>tips on how to create the best selfie</p>
<p>of the best angle that will maximally,</p>
<p>you know, enhance what you look like.</p>
<p>Or just doctoring of photos, I&rsquo;m guessing.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Photoshopping, absolutely.</p>
<p>And one of the things about it,</p>
<p>now you say like, well, do people find out?</p>
<p>Of course, people do find out.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;ll just give you one story</p>
<p>about a colleague of mine who was doing,</p>
<p>is a male who&rsquo;s doing internet dating.</p>
<p>And he picked only women who self-described</p>
<p>as sevens on the one to seven on attractiveness.</p>
<p>So the most attractive as self-reported.</p>
<p>And so, and he went out with this one woman</p>
<p>and she was missing her front teeth.</p>
<p>And he said, well, call me picky,</p>
<p>but missing her front teeth.</p>
<p>And she thinks she&rsquo;s like the top of attractors.</p>
<p>He was a little disappointed about that.</p>
<p>And women of course are disappointed.</p>
<p>They meet a guy who they think is this physically fit,</p>
<p>you know, athletic guy.</p>
<p>And he comes up, he&rsquo;s, you know, 300 pounds and overweight.</p>
<p>So people do find out.</p>
<p>And so, and there are some internet dating sites</p>
<p>have kind of a vetting of the accuracy of something.</p>
<p>So some things you can look up through public records.</p>
<p>And does this guy have a criminal record, for example?</p>
<p>Is he on a, you know, a sexual offenders website?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s some things you can verify.</p>
<p>But what I tell people is you really have to meet the person</p>
<p>and interact, you know, in part because of the deception,</p>
<p>but also because what happens with internet dating</p>
<p>is that the photograph tends to overwhelm</p>
<p>all the other cues.</p>
<p>And all the other cues are written statements.</p>
<p>And we weren&rsquo;t really evolved to process written statements,</p>
<p>but we were evolved to respond to physical cues.</p>
<p>But, and men tend to attend to the visual cues</p>
<p>much more than women.</p>
<p>So women in their mate selection,</p>
<p>they have olfactory cues.</p>
<p>So what does the guy sound like?</p>
<p>His vocal qualities, that&rsquo;s auditory cues.</p>
<p>But olfactory cues, what does he smell like?</p>
<p>And so women have a more acute sense of smell than men do.</p>
<p>And so if the guy doesn&rsquo;t smell right,</p>
<p>even if he embodies all the other qualities women want,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a deal breaker.</p>
<p>And so I encourage people just, you know,</p>
<p>stop with the 100 texts back and forth or messaging</p>
<p>and meet a person for a cup of coffee and interact.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;ll, you know,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll get a more accurate beat on the person.</p>
<p>And then of course, some qualities you can&rsquo;t assess</p>
<p>even with a half hour interaction, you can tell a lot,</p>
<p>but things like emotional stability</p>
<p>are things that have to be assessed over time.</p>
<p>And so one of the things that I advise people to do,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m not in the advice giving business,</p>
<p>but people ask me all the time.</p>
<p>Once they find out what I study,</p>
<p>they say, well, I got this problem.</p>
<p>Can you give me advice?</p>
<p>But one of the things to assess things</p>
<p>like emotional stability,</p>
<p>which is absolutely critical in long-term mating</p>
<p>is to do something like go on a trip together,</p>
<p>take a vacation where you&rsquo;re,</p>
<p>even in an unfamiliar environment where you&rsquo;re,</p>
<p>you have to cope with things that you&rsquo;re not familiar with.</p>
<p>And as opposed to an environment where it&rsquo;s very predictable</p>
<p>and so you get a greater exposure</p>
<p>because one of the hallmarks of emotional instability</p>
<p>is how they respond to stress.</p>
<p>So emotionally unstable people tend to have a long latency</p>
<p>to return to baseline after a stressful event.</p>
<p>And so this is the sort of information</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t get on a coffee date.</p>
<p>You know, you can only get by assessing it over time.</p>
<p>Well, as somebody whose laboratory studies stress</p>
<p>and tools to combat stress, that&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s yet more incentive for people</p>
<p>to develop self-regulatory mechanisms for themselves.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m guessing many of the features of deception</p>
<p>in this context were present long before internet dating.</p>
<p>And so is it, it&rsquo;s somewhat dark to think about,</p>
<p>but is deception built into this dance</p>
<p>that we call mate selection</p>
<p>and has it been built in for a long time?</p>
<p>Or is this something that you think has emerged more</p>
<p>as people are approaching each other</p>
<p>through these electronic web-based mediums?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, some forms of deception have been there</p>
<p>for a long time over human evolutionary history.</p>
<p>So one form of deception, which we haven&rsquo;t mentioned,</p>
<p>is deception about whether you&rsquo;re interested</p>
<p>in a long-term committed relationship</p>
<p>or a short-term hookup.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s deception about that,</p>
<p>especially on the part of men.</p>
<p>So men who are interested, like on Tinder,</p>
<p>it has been reported, although Tinder denies this,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s been reported that something like 30%</p>
<p>of the men on Tinder are either married</p>
<p>or in long-term committed relationships</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re looking for something on the side.</p>
<p>But in terms of successfully attracting a mate,</p>
<p>the overt display that, hey, I&rsquo;m interested</p>
<p>in just a short-term hookup, I&rsquo;m interested in sex,</p>
<p>so I wanna have sex right now,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s just go back to my apartment,</p>
<p>these are very ineffective tactics.</p>
<p>And so effective tactics for men are often displaying cues</p>
<p>to long-term interest.</p>
<p>And so, and of course, that&rsquo;s effective</p>
<p>for a woman who&rsquo;s seeking a long-term interest.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s a deception.</p>
<p>So we find in our studies of deception</p>
<p>that men tend to exaggerate the depths</p>
<p>of their feelings for a woman,</p>
<p>exaggerate how similar they are</p>
<p>and how aligned they are in their values</p>
<p>and religious orientations and political values</p>
<p>and so forth.</p>
<p>And so I think there&rsquo;s deception around that.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s probably an evolutionarily recurrent form</p>
<p>of deception that women have defenses against, by the way.</p>
<p>But I think that modern internet dating opens the door</p>
<p>for certain types of deception that were,</p>
<p>at a minimum, were difficult to accomplish ancestrally.</p>
<p>So like things like Photoshopping,</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t available back then.</p>
<p>Plus, we evolved in the context of small group living</p>
<p>where you not only had your own personal observations</p>
<p>of someone&rsquo;s qualities, you had also your relatives,</p>
<p>your friends, allies, the social reputation</p>
<p>that someone had.</p>
<p>And these are all critical sources of information</p>
<p>that are less available in modern environments</p>
<p>because people migrate, they move from place to place,</p>
<p>they can close down one internet profile and put up another,</p>
<p>or they could have six going simultaneously.</p>
<p>So the modern environment opens up the door</p>
<p>for forms of deception that weren&rsquo;t available</p>
<p>or weren&rsquo;t available to the same degree ancestrally.</p>
<p>I see.</p>
<p>Very interesting.</p>
<p>Would you mind touching on some of the features</p>
<p>that are selected for in terms of sexual partner choice?</p>
<p>We talked a little bit about mate choice,</p>
<p>but in terms of sexual partner choice,</p>
<p>are there any good studies exploring</p>
<p>what people are selecting for,</p>
<p>or is it that they are both just in a state</p>
<p>of pure hypothalamic drive, I&rsquo;m a neuroscientist after all,</p>
<p>and therefore it&rsquo;s hard to recreate it in the laboratory?</p>
<p>Well, no, we do know something about that,</p>
<p>and we know something about how the preferences</p>
<p>for a sex partner differ from preference</p>
<p>for a long-term mate.</p>
<p>There is overlap, of course,</p>
<p>but one thing is physical appearance.</p>
<p>So physical appearance for women</p>
<p>is important in long-term mating,</p>
<p>not as important as it is for men,</p>
<p>but it becomes more important in short-term mating.</p>
<p>And so is the guy good-looking?</p>
<p>So those physical attributes are more important for women.</p>
<p>They remain important for men,</p>
<p>physical appearance in short-term mating,</p>
<p>but with the footnote that men are willing</p>
<p>to drop their standards in short-term mating</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s low commitment, low risk,</p>
<p>just sex without entangling commitments.</p>
<p>Women are more likely to prioritize</p>
<p>what I call bad boy qualities,</p>
<p>so guys who are very self-confident,</p>
<p>guys who are strut, guys who are a little arrogant,</p>
<p>guys who are risk-taking, guys who defy conventions.</p>
<p>Women are more attracted to those guys</p>
<p>in short-term mating than long-term mating.</p>
<p>And whereas in long-term mating,</p>
<p>they go more for the good dad qualities.</p>
<p>Is this guy dependable?</p>
<p>Is he gonna be a good father to my children?</p>
<p>And then also in short-term mating,</p>
<p>women use that mate copying heuristic.</p>
<p>That is, if there are thousands of other women</p>
<p>who find him attractive, women find him attractive.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s why you have the groupie phenomenon.</p>
<p>So with the rock stars, for example,</p>
<p>there are thousands of screaming women,</p>
<p>all of whom wanna sleep with this famous rock star,</p>
<p>and they use that as information.</p>
<p>They find, if you took like a still photo</p>
<p>of some of these rock stars and asked women</p>
<p>how attractive the guy is versus tell him</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a famous rock star and showed the thousands</p>
<p>of women screaming at him,</p>
<p>they judge him entirely differently</p>
<p>in terms of his attractiveness.</p>
<p>So even, and this is an important point,</p>
<p>that women&rsquo;s attraction to men is more context-specific</p>
<p>and varies more across contexts</p>
<p>than men&rsquo;s attraction to women.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;ll give you just an example</p>
<p>that this is a female colleague of mine</p>
<p>went to a conference, an academic conference,</p>
<p>and she found the organizer of this conference</p>
<p>to be really attractive and then saw him six months later</p>
<p>and wondered, well, what was I thinking?</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t seem very attractive at all.</p>
<p>And what it was is when he was the organizer,</p>
<p>he was at the center of the attention structure.</p>
<p>He was the guy up on stage directing everybody</p>
<p>and everyone was attending to him.</p>
<p>And then when he was just a normal presenter</p>
<p>at a conference, he didn&rsquo;t command the attention structure</p>
<p>like he did in that when he was the organizer.</p>
<p>And so this is just an illustration</p>
<p>of how circumstance-dependent women&rsquo;s</p>
<p>mate attraction is for guys.</p>
<p>It depends on his status,</p>
<p>the number of women that are attracted to him,</p>
<p>the attention structure, how he interacts with a puppy</p>
<p>or a baby, if he&rsquo;s ignoring a baby in distress</p>
<p>or positively interacting with a young child.</p>
<p>All these things, whereas for men, it almost doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>Context is more irrelevant.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re honing in on the specific psychophysical cues</p>
<p>that the woman is displaying and context be damned.</p>
<p>Very interesting.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about infidelity in committed relationships.</p>
<p>What are some of the consistent findings around reasons for</p>
<p>and maybe even long-term consequences</p>
<p>of infidelity for men and women?</p>
<p>And this could be marriage or long-term partnership</p>
<p>or infidelity of any kind, I suppose.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m guessing it does happen.</p>
<p>How frequent is it?</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s the interesting thing.</p>
<p>Well, how frequent it is is difficult to gauge</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s one of the forms of human conduct</p>
<p>that people like to keep secret.</p>
<p>So if you go back now, say 70 years</p>
<p>to the classic Kinsey studies,</p>
<p>the questions about infidelity were the questions</p>
<p>that most people refused to answer.</p>
<p>And when the question was brought up,</p>
<p>caused more people to drop out of the study.</p>
<p>And so that kind of tells you something that,</p>
<p>I mean, what do people conceal?</p>
<p>Infidelity, incest, murder,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a small handful of things</p>
<p>that people universally wanna conceal</p>
<p>and infidelity is one of them.</p>
<p>But people do it.</p>
<p>And so Kinsey estimated 26% of married women</p>
<p>committed an infidelity at some point during their marriage</p>
<p>and about 50% of men.</p>
<p>Other studies have given lower figures.</p>
<p>And so the exact figures bounce around</p>
<p>depending on anonymity provided</p>
<p>and how comfortable they are with the interviewer</p>
<p>and so forth.</p>
<p>And by infidelity,</p>
<p>does that mean intercourse with somebody else?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re not talking about quote unquote emotional affairs.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking about sex with somebody</p>
<p>other than their committed partner</p>
<p>unbeknownst to their partner.</p>
<p>Right, right.</p>
<p>And there are other forms of infidelity</p>
<p>which we could get into including emotional infidelity</p>
<p>and financial infidelity.</p>
<p>But here we&rsquo;re just talking about for the moment,</p>
<p>sexual infidelity.</p>
<p>And the interesting thing about sexual infidelity</p>
<p>is that the sexes really differ fundamentally</p>
<p>in the motives for committing infidelity.</p>
<p>So for men, the primary motive</p>
<p>and these are on average sex differences.</p>
<p>So whenever I talk about secondary,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking about on average sex differences</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s overlap in the distributions.</p>
<p>But so these are generalizations</p>
<p>of which there are exceptions.</p>
<p>So for men, it&rsquo;s mainly a matter of sexual variety.</p>
<p>So about 70% of the men,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the opportunity presented itself.</p>
<p>I was out of town and I had this opportunity.</p>
<p>So low risk, low cost pursuit of sexual variety,</p>
<p>sexual novelty is a key motivation for men.</p>
<p>Sorry to interrupt.</p>
<p>So 70% of men that cheat, that&rsquo;s the primary cause</p>
<p>or is it that 70% of men do cheat?</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>Of the men who cheat 70%, thank you for that clarification.</p>
<p>Of the men who do cheat 70%, cite that as the key motive,</p>
<p>the key reason why they committed an infidelity.</p>
<p>Sort of like why mountain climbers climb mountains</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re there.</p>
<p>Right, right, because they&rsquo;re there.</p>
<p>If they, well, the comedian, I think it was Chris Rock</p>
<p>said men are only as faithful as their opportunity.</p>
<p>Or how available their password on their phone is</p>
<p>to their partner.</p>
<p>Right, right, yeah.</p>
<p>So, but, and that&rsquo;s an exaggeration,</p>
<p>but if you look at women,</p>
<p>this just desire for pure novelty,</p>
<p>sexual variety is much less of a motive.</p>
<p>But women who have affairs,</p>
<p>cite that they&rsquo;re unhappy with their primary relationship,</p>
<p>emotionally unhappy or sexually unhappy and typically both.</p>
<p>And this may seem like totally obvious that,</p>
<p>well, of course people if they&rsquo;re unhappy</p>
<p>in the relationship are more likely to stray,</p>
<p>but in fact, it&rsquo;s not true for men.</p>
<p>So if you compare men who are happy with their marriage</p>
<p>and men who are not happy with their marriage,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no difference in their infidelity rates.</p>
<p>And I think it goes down to that issue</p>
<p>of motive for seeking variety.</p>
<p>So now, why do women do it?</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s a risky endeavor.</p>
<p>She risks her long-term mate or losing a long-term mate.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s risky in terms of reputational damage for both sexes.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a risky thing.</p>
<p>Why do women do it?</p>
<p>And there are two competing hypotheses, at least two,</p>
<p>but there are two primary competing hypotheses</p>
<p>in the evolutionary literature.</p>
<p>One is called the dual mating strategy hypothesis</p>
<p>where women are seeking to get resources and investment</p>
<p>from one guy and good genes from another guy.</p>
<p>So in principle, that can work.</p>
<p>And I initially, this wasn&rsquo;t a hypothesis original with me.</p>
<p>This is Steve Gangestad, Randy Thornhill</p>
<p>and some others of Marty Hazleton,</p>
<p>a former student of mine have advocated</p>
<p>this dual mating strategy hypothesis.</p>
<p>And originally I was endorsed it</p>
<p>because the data seemed to support it.</p>
<p>We can get into which data seemed to support it.</p>
<p>But over time, I became more and more dubious</p>
<p>about this hypothesis and instead have advocated</p>
<p>what I call the mate switching hypothesis.</p>
<p>And so if you look at a whole host of information</p>
<p>around why women have affairs,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not compatible with the dual mating strategy</p>
<p>hypothesis and is compatible with the mate switching.</p>
<p>That is women who are looking to either divest themselves</p>
<p>from an existing mateship or trade up in the mating market</p>
<p>to a mate who&rsquo;s more compatible with them</p>
<p>or higher in mate value,</p>
<p>or simply see whether they&rsquo;re sufficiently desirable</p>
<p>so that it eases the transition into the mating pool</p>
<p>or keeping a mate as a potential backup mate,</p>
<p>what I call mate insurance.</p>
<p>If you have car insurance,</p>
<p>if something bad happens to your car, house insurance,</p>
<p>we also have mate insurance,</p>
<p>keeping someone, one woman said, men are like soup.</p>
<p>You always wanna have one on the back burner.</p>
<p>So whether that&rsquo;s the best analogy or not, I&rsquo;m not sure,</p>
<p>but it kind of captures something about why.</p>
<p>So, well, what evidence am I talking about?</p>
<p>Well, for one thing, women who have affairs,</p>
<p>and this is about 70% of them, they-</p>
<p>Again, sorry, just I wanna make sure people,</p>
<p>of women who have affairs.</p>
<p>Yeah, of the women who have affairs.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s say ballpark Kinsey was, let&rsquo;s say roughly right,</p>
<p>25, 26% of women will have affairs.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just assume that he&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>And we don&rsquo;t know exactly,</p>
<p>but of the women who do have affairs,</p>
<p>about 70% say they have fallen in love</p>
<p>with their affair partner.</p>
<p>They become deeply emotionally involved</p>
<p>with their affair partner.</p>
<p>And to me, if you&rsquo;re just trying</p>
<p>to get good genes from a guy,</p>
<p>that is the last thing you wanna do,</p>
<p>is fall in love with them or get emotionally involved.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s very compatible if you wanna switch mates.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s one piece of evidence</p>
<p>that suggests that women,</p>
<p>the mate-switching function of infidelity</p>
<p>is a more likely explanation.</p>
<p>Now, these two are not inherently incompatible hypotheses.</p>
<p>In other words, it&rsquo;s possible that some women</p>
<p>do pursue a dual mating strategy hypothesis,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s other evidence that suggests,</p>
<p>so for example, what are the actual rates</p>
<p>of genetic cuckoldry?</p>
<p>Well, in the modern environment anyway,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re pretty low.</p>
<p>It turns out they&rsquo;re like 2% to 3%.</p>
<p>Could you just explain for the audience</p>
<p>what genetic cuckoldry is?</p>
<p>So this is where the man believes</p>
<p>he is the genetic father of a child,</p>
<p>but it turns out he&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>Might be the mailman or the next door neighbor</p>
<p>or the guy she&rsquo;s having an affair with.</p>
<p>So mistaken paternity.</p>
<p>And genetic cuckoldry is just one way to capture.</p>
<p>Named after the cuckoo bird, right?</p>
<p>Named after the cuckoo bird, yes.</p>
<p>Who sneaks its eggs into the nest of the other roles,</p>
<p>destroys the future offspring of the bird,</p>
<p>and then basically offloads all the work</p>
<p>onto another father.</p>
<p>Parasitizes, yeah, the parental investment</p>
<p>of a different bird species.</p>
<p>So anyway, so I think that,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s other sources of evidence that I think point,</p>
<p>so one of the sources of evidence</p>
<p>that initially seemed to support</p>
<p>the dual mating strategy hypothesis was ovulation shifts.</p>
<p>So in other words, it looked like from the early studies</p>
<p>that when women are ovulating,</p>
<p>these are among non-pill-taking women,</p>
<p>women not on hormonal contraceptives,</p>
<p>that they experienced a preference shift</p>
<p>toward more men who were masculine and symmetrical,</p>
<p>which were hypothesized markers for good genes.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s an explanation for that.</p>
<p>But it turns out the effects of ovulation</p>
<p>on women&rsquo;s mate preferences are far weaker</p>
<p>than the initial studies looked like.</p>
<p>And in fact, some larger scale studies</p>
<p>have failed to replicate them entirely.</p>
<p>And so that was one of the key sources of evidence,</p>
<p>these ovulation shifts,</p>
<p>that women were going after good genes</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s only when she&rsquo;s ovulating</p>
<p>and she can get pregnant by having sex with another man</p>
<p>that it would make sense for her</p>
<p>to have sex with another man.</p>
<p>And there was even some early evidence</p>
<p>that women were timing their affairs,</p>
<p>timing sex with their affair partners</p>
<p>to coincide with when they were ovulating.</p>
<p>But as I said, some of these subsequent studies</p>
<p>have failed to replicate these early findings</p>
<p>calling into question the dual mating strategy notion.</p>
<p>And so I think I&rsquo;ve shifted my views on this</p>
<p>and now endorse the mate switching hypothesis</p>
<p>as a more likely explanation</p>
<p>for why most women have affairs.</p>
<p>Well, the way you describe this makes me wonder</p>
<p>if of the women that have affairs,</p>
<p>do those affairs tend to be more long lasting</p>
<p>than the affairs that men have?</p>
<p>Because the way you describe it is</p>
<p>men are seizing an opportunity,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a sort of a carpe diem type approach to infidelity,</p>
<p>and women potentially on average</p>
<p>are capitalizing on something that is longer term.</p>
<p>Now, of course, if they&rsquo;re doing this around ovulation,</p>
<p>then it would constrain the amount of times</p>
<p>they would need to see or have sex</p>
<p>with this other person that they&rsquo;re not married to.</p>
<p>But is there any evidence</p>
<p>that women have more ongoing affairs</p>
<p>and men have more transient affairs?</p>
<p>Yes, yeah, there is.</p>
<p>And so if you look at people who have affairs,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a sex difference there.</p>
<p>So that women tend to have affairs with one person</p>
<p>and become emotionally involved</p>
<p>with that one person over time.</p>
<p>Men who have affairs tend to have affairs</p>
<p>with a larger number of affair partners.</p>
<p>And so, which then by definition can&rsquo;t be long last,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t have long-term affairs</p>
<p>with six different partners.</p>
<p>Yeah, unless he&rsquo;s juggling multiple phone accounts</p>
<p>or something like that.</p>
<p>Right, right, right.</p>
<p>And some men try to do that,</p>
<p>I think it could be very taxing.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, and in this day and age,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s easier to meet more people</p>
<p>by virtue of online communications,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also easier to get caught,</p>
<p>meaning it&rsquo;s harder to conceal interactions.</p>
<p>Everything&rsquo;s in the cloud anyway.</p>
<p>A good friend of mine who&rsquo;s a former very high level</p>
<p>in special operations said,</p>
<p>anything that&rsquo;s not in your head and only in your head</p>
<p>is available for others to find should they want it.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s largely true.</p>
<p>Yeah, and yeah, so phone information, text messages,</p>
<p>and people are very good at hacking into their partners,</p>
<p>phones, computers,</p>
<p>and then also there are video cameras everywhere.</p>
<p>So, sneaking off to this quiet restaurant,</p>
<p>I mean, there are probably eight video cameras</p>
<p>that can record you walking in and out of that restaurant.</p>
<p>Everything can be found, I&rsquo;m certain of that.</p>
<p>You mentioned emotional affairs</p>
<p>and financial infidelity as well.</p>
<p>I had a girlfriend once who, as a early date discussion,</p>
<p>said, not that I get the impression that you are,</p>
<p>but I want to be very clear, she said,</p>
<p>that you are not emotionally, physically,</p>
<p>or financially tied to any other women.</p>
<p>And I thought it was very interesting</p>
<p>that now you bring up financial infidelity.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s quite happily partnered now, and not with me,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the first time I heard anyone spell it out that way</p>
<p>as a list, almost like specific aims in a grant.</p>
<p>What is emotional infidelity?</p>
<p>What is financial infidelity?</p>
<p>Yeah, well, this is a very smart woman</p>
<p>to tap into all three. Indeed, she is.</p>
<p>So, and I assumed you gave honest responses</p>
<p>to all of those three questions.</p>
<p>As I recall, I did, but as we now know that they&rsquo;re,</p>
<p>well, you can ask her at some point.</p>
<p>Right, right, okay.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m happy to provide you her information.</p>
<p>And there is self-deception,</p>
<p>and the service of deception is another issue.</p>
<p>So, emotional infidelity is basically</p>
<p>exactly what it sounds like.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s falling in love with someone else,</p>
<p>becoming psychologically close to someone else,</p>
<p>sharing intimate or private information with someone else.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I mean by emotional infidelity.</p>
<p>And one of the hallmarks of this,</p>
<p>a study done by a former student of mine, Barry Cooley,</p>
<p>was very clever, I thought.</p>
<p>He analyzed, there used to be this reality TV show</p>
<p>called Cheaters, where they would hire detectives,</p>
<p>and they would, when the detective would, like say,</p>
<p>follow someone to a hotel room,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;d call up the partner and say,</p>
<p>your husband just walked into the hotel room</p>
<p>with someone else, would you like to come down</p>
<p>to the hotel and confront him?</p>
<p>And a certain percentage of people would confront.</p>
<p>And what he analyzed, so he analyzed all these episodes</p>
<p>of this show called Cheaters,</p>
<p>and what he examined was the verbal interrogations</p>
<p>when people confronted their partners.</p>
<p>And when men confronted their partners,</p>
<p>the first question they wanted to know is, did you fuck him?</p>
<p>Women, their first question was, do you love her?</p>
<p>And so, this kind of captures that difference</p>
<p>between the sexual infidelity and emotional infidelity,</p>
<p>and also kind of captures another sex difference</p>
<p>when it comes to sexual jealousy,</p>
<p>where men tend to be more focused</p>
<p>on the sexual components of the infidelity,</p>
<p>because those are what compromise his paternity certainty,</p>
<p>his certainty that he&rsquo;s actually the genetic father</p>
<p>of whatever offspring ensue.</p>
<p>Whereas, love is a cue to, do you love her?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a cue that he&rsquo;s gonna leave you,</p>
<p>the woman, for another woman.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a cue to the long-term loss of that investment</p>
<p>and commitment from that partner.</p>
<p>And so, the sexes seem to differ</p>
<p>in which aspects of the infidelity,</p>
<p>with women more attuned to,</p>
<p>more upset by the emotional infidelity,</p>
<p>men more by the sexual infidelity.</p>
<p>Now, financial infidelity has been explored much less,</p>
<p>but in my new book, When Men Behave Badly,</p>
<p>I have a section on financial infidelity,</p>
<p>where I summarize all the research that has been done,</p>
<p>and I was kind of flabbergasted</p>
<p>by the percentage of people who do things</p>
<p>like have credit cards that their spouse doesn&rsquo;t know about,</p>
<p>keep secret bank accounts,</p>
<p>have the credit card bills mailed to their office</p>
<p>rather than their home,</p>
<p>have basically resources and expenditures</p>
<p>of pooled resources that they keep from their partner,</p>
<p>and both sexes do it.</p>
<p>And the percentages vary from study to study,</p>
<p>but they range from like 30 to 60% of all people</p>
<p>who are keeping financial information</p>
<p>from their spouse in one way or another.</p>
<p>It could be the woman&rsquo;s out buying designer purses</p>
<p>or designer handbags.</p>
<p>It could be the guy&rsquo;s out going to strip clubs</p>
<p>or taking his affair partner to restaurants</p>
<p>and doesn&rsquo;t want those charges to show up</p>
<p>on a jointly held credit card.</p>
<p>So financial infidelity is critical.</p>
<p>And then even things like diverting pooled resources</p>
<p>to one set of genetic relatives versus another set</p>
<p>is another thing that people tend to keep secret.</p>
<p>So there are forms of financial infidelity as well.</p>
<p>So yeah, infidelity, it&rsquo;s a great question</p>
<p>because it shouldn&rsquo;t be confined to sexual infidelity,</p>
<p>which is what most people think about,</p>
<p>but also emotional and financial.</p>
<p>Interestingly, if you ask people,</p>
<p>what is infidelity in a marriage?</p>
<p>Men tend to say, well, it&rsquo;s obvious</p>
<p>that she has sex with someone else, that&rsquo;s infidelity.</p>
<p>Whereas women are more likely</p>
<p>to have a broader definition of infidelity.</p>
<p>They will cite things like emotional infidelity,</p>
<p>financial infidelity as part of the definition,</p>
<p>whereas men have that more narrow definition.</p>
<p>Interesting, I have a good friend</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s a couples counselor, a clinical psychologist.</p>
<p>And she told me something interesting that relates to this,</p>
<p>which is that in cases of infidelity,</p>
<p>oftentimes some of the arguments between couples</p>
<p>boil down to whether or not contraception was used or not.</p>
<p>And that becomes a key feature.</p>
<p>And she always thought that that was homing in on a detail,</p>
<p>which of course is an important detail</p>
<p>as it relates to both paternity issues and pregnancy,</p>
<p>but also disease, right?</p>
<p>But as we&rsquo;re talking about all this,</p>
<p>it makes me think that this may have deeper</p>
<p>evolutionary roots further down in the brain,</p>
<p>as we say in neuroscience literature.</p>
<p>And yeah, and using a condom versus not using a condom,</p>
<p>not using is a more intimate act in a way.</p>
<p>You are literally physically more intimate</p>
<p>with someone else than if you do use a condom.</p>
<p>So, but whether evolutionary roots to this, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I mean, condoms are probably relatively recent</p>
<p>or at least a widespread use of them</p>
<p>are relatively recent in evolutionary time.</p>
<p>So I doubt we have adaptations specifically for them.</p>
<p>No, and presumably before condoms,</p>
<p>one can only speculate because as we say,</p>
<p>when it comes to behavior, there&rsquo;s rarely a fossil record,</p>
<p>but sometimes there is,</p>
<p>it would be the withdrawal method of contraception,</p>
<p>which a good friend of mine who studies,</p>
<p>whose laboratory works on reproductive biology says</p>
<p>the reason that&rsquo;s a poor choice of contraception</p>
<p>is because it was designed not to work.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So note to those of trying to avoid unwanted pregnancy.</p>
<p>So we talked a little bit about status</p>
<p>in terms of what men and women are selecting</p>
<p>for different types of relationships.</p>
<p>Is there anything else about status</p>
<p>that you find particularly interesting</p>
<p>and what men are finding attractive</p>
<p>besides these waist to hip ratios</p>
<p>and quality of potential mothers and so forth?</p>
<p>Are there any kind of hidden gems in the literature</p>
<p>around this that I might not have heard of?</p>
<p>Well, yeah.</p>
<p>So you mean among things like sex differences</p>
<p>and what leads to high status or-</p>
<p>For instance, or what,</p>
<p>or perhaps things that are surprising</p>
<p>in terms of what people are selecting for.</p>
<p>Do people even know what they&rsquo;re selecting for?</p>
<p>This is, or is this all subconscious?</p>
<p>Any and all of those topics are of interest to me.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So, well, to take them in reverse order,</p>
<p>I think a lot of it is conscious,</p>
<p>but some of it is certainly unconscious</p>
<p>or there are elements which are totally unconscious.</p>
<p>So I mentioned one earlier where a man looks at a woman,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s not, he&rsquo;s aware that he&rsquo;s attracted to her</p>
<p>and attracted to her physical appearance,</p>
<p>but he might not be aware of why.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t evolve to be aware of why.</p>
<p>Just like with food preferences,</p>
<p>we find certain things delectable</p>
<p>and other things nauseating.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t understand the adaptive logic</p>
<p>of why our food preferences exist and why we have them.</p>
<p>And the same is true of mating, you know?</p>
<p>And so men find women</p>
<p>with a low waist-hip ratio attractive,</p>
<p>but they might not, they almost rarely,</p>
<p>rarely will they know, oh, low waist-hip ratio</p>
<p>is actually associated with higher fertility,</p>
<p>lower endocrinological problems, lower age, et cetera.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re sometimes aware of what we want,</p>
<p>but we are unaware of why we want it.</p>
<p>So I think there are unconscious elements</p>
<p>that the whole topic of status</p>
<p>and what leads to high status and low status</p>
<p>is a topic I&rsquo;m currently investigating.</p>
<p>Published a couple scientific articles on it</p>
<p>and so, but maybe we&rsquo;ll hold off on that</p>
<p>for a future discussion.</p>
<p>But it intersects, I&rsquo;ll mention one,</p>
<p>it intersects with mating in interesting ways</p>
<p>in that higher status gives people the ability</p>
<p>to choose from a wider pool of potential mates</p>
<p>than they would if they have low status.</p>
<p>And so one of the reasons that people strive for status</p>
<p>is because they have access to more desirable mates.</p>
<p>Conversely, having desirable mates</p>
<p>endows you with higher status.</p>
<p>And so if you have, if you&rsquo;re a male,</p>
<p>you have a very attractive woman on your arm</p>
<p>that leads to high status.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s a reciprocal link between status</p>
<p>and mating in that way.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;ve been studies where you say</p>
<p>they pose a kind of unattractive guy,</p>
<p>older unattractive guy,</p>
<p>and a stunningly beautiful woman as a girlfriend.</p>
<p>And they say, well, what&rsquo;s this guy all about?</p>
<p>And they say, oh, he must be very high in status.</p>
<p>He must be very wealthy.</p>
<p>He must have a lot going for him.</p>
<p>Whereas the reverse,</p>
<p>people don&rsquo;t make the same attributions.</p>
<p>And so there is an interesting reciprocal link</p>
<p>between status and mating success</p>
<p>where mating success leads to high status</p>
<p>and high status leads to more mating success.</p>
<p>So over and over again,</p>
<p>there are these instances that you describe</p>
<p>where the assessment of potential mate sexual</p>
<p>or long-term partnership</p>
<p>are being made in the contents of good statistical practices,</p>
<p>looking at the choices of others</p>
<p>as a readout of your own choices.</p>
<p>This seems to be a theme that this is not being made</p>
<p>in a very narrow context,</p>
<p>but paying attention to what other people</p>
<p>are paying attention to seems to come up again and again.</p>
<p>Slightly off-center from that,</p>
<p>but still paying attention to what other people</p>
<p>are paying attention to.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s known about jealousy in men versus women</p>
<p>and how frequent it is, how intense it is,</p>
<p>and what people do with that jealousy?</p>
<p>I mean, we hear, or I&rsquo;ve heard at some point</p>
<p>that a large fraction of homicides</p>
<p>are the consequence of jealous lovers.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the darkest angle of all this,</p>
<p>but in evolutionary psychology context, what is jealousy?</p>
<p>Does it relate to paternity issues only?</p>
<p>What can you tell us about jealousy?</p>
<p>Yeah, so, well, it&rsquo;s a great set of questions.</p>
<p>And when I first started studying jealousy,</p>
<p>I reviewed all the prior publications on jealousy.</p>
<p>And at that time, jealousy was regarded</p>
<p>as a sign of immaturity,</p>
<p>a sign of insecurity,</p>
<p>a sign of neurosis or pathology,</p>
<p>or in some cases, delusion.</p>
<p>And what I argued is, and do argue,</p>
<p>is that jealousy is an evolved emotion</p>
<p>that serves several adaptive functions, okay?</p>
<p>One of which you mentioned</p>
<p>is a paternity certainty function.</p>
<p>But to back up a second,</p>
<p>basically, once you have the evolution</p>
<p>of long-term mating, long-term pair bonds,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re talking about, from a male perspective,</p>
<p>investing a tremendous amount of resources</p>
<p>in a woman and her children over years or decades.</p>
<p>Even with boomerang kids now,</p>
<p>it may even go more than two decades.</p>
<p>Boomerang kids?</p>
<p>Yeah, kids who leave home</p>
<p>and then come back and live at home.</p>
<p>That happens?</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, that happens.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have children, so I-</p>
<p>Okay, yeah, no, that&rsquo;s a big thing.</p>
<p>But if I do, I&rsquo;ll just expect</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;ll come back at some point.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll come back because they can&rsquo;t find a job</p>
<p>or they find it cheaper to live</p>
<p>at the parents&rsquo; house or whatever.</p>
<p>Oh, goodness, I can&rsquo;t think of anything worse.</p>
<p>I mean, I love my parents, but-</p>
<p>I know, I know, again, I can&rsquo;t imagine,</p>
<p>but it happens, and it&rsquo;s happening more and more</p>
<p>given the current economic situation.</p>
<p>Okay, but, so once you have long-term mating,</p>
<p>you need a defense to prevent</p>
<p>or preserve the investment that you&rsquo;ve made</p>
<p>in our making in long-term mateship.</p>
<p>And so jealousy serves this mate guarding function,</p>
<p>if you will, or mate retention function.</p>
<p>So in other words, one way of phrasing this</p>
<p>is that we know that there are affairs,</p>
<p>we know that people break up, they get divorced,</p>
<p>but people have adaptations</p>
<p>to want to hold on to their mates, okay?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what jealousy is in part about.</p>
<p>And so jealousy gets activated</p>
<p>when there are threats to that romantic relationship.</p>
<p>And there are other forms of jealousy</p>
<p>like sibling jealousy and so forth,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re focusing on mating jealousy in this context.</p>
<p>So now what&rsquo;s interesting is that the threats</p>
<p>to an ongoing valued romantic relationship</p>
<p>come from many sources.</p>
<p>So they could be you detect cues</p>
<p>to your partner&rsquo;s infidelity</p>
<p>or cues of a lack of an emotional distance</p>
<p>between you and your partner.</p>
<p>You say I love you to your partner</p>
<p>and your partner says,</p>
<p>oh, I wonder how the hell the Knicks are doing</p>
<p>this scoring season or whatever.</p>
<p>If you get an unreciprocated I love you is a bad cue.</p>
<p>Or some people are so tuned to this,</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s a half millisecond delay,</p>
<p>they can detect delays in responses.</p>
<p>Yes, yeah, delays in responses.</p>
<p>But even things like, so that&rsquo;s one set of cues.</p>
<p>But then there&rsquo;s another set of interested mate poachers.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re mated to someone who&rsquo;s desirable,</p>
<p>which many people are, other people still desire them.</p>
<p>And so sometimes try to poach them</p>
<p>or lure them away from you</p>
<p>for a short term sexual encounter</p>
<p>or for a longer term relationship.</p>
<p>And so we have to be,</p>
<p>so jealousy motivates people to be attentive</p>
<p>to potential mate poachers in their environment.</p>
<p>But even more subtle things like mate value discrepancies</p>
<p>can trigger jealousy.</p>
<p>So even if there are no mate poachers</p>
<p>and no cues to infidelity,</p>
<p>if a mate value discrepancy opens up in a relationship,</p>
<p>so in the American system,</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;re a six or an eight or a 10,</p>
<p>and people generally pair off</p>
<p>based on similarity in mate value.</p>
<p>So that tends to happen.</p>
<p>Sixes end up with sixes,</p>
<p>sevens end up with sixes, plus or minus one.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So yeah.</p>
<p>These are somewhat subjective scale.</p>
<p>Okay, it&rsquo;s somewhat subjective,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s still some consensus about these things.</p>
<p>So even colloquially, people say things like,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s not good enough for you,</p>
<p>or I think you could do better.</p>
<p>So people can implicitly have a notion</p>
<p>of relative mate value and discrepancies therein.</p>
<p>Okay, but discrepancies can open up</p>
<p>where none previously existed.</p>
<p>So you get fired from a job all of a sudden,</p>
<p>and most people are very understanding and forgiving</p>
<p>about that if it&rsquo;s not too long,</p>
<p>but you go six months, eight months,</p>
<p>people start having problems.</p>
<p>Or if someone&rsquo;s career takes off,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say a woman becomes a famous singer</p>
<p>or actress or a man does,</p>
<p>career takes off,</p>
<p>all of a sudden there&rsquo;s a mate value discrepancy</p>
<p>where you have access to a larger pool</p>
<p>of potential mates and higher mate value potential mates.</p>
<p>So people are attentive to mate value discrepancies.</p>
<p>And so jealousy can get activated,</p>
<p>even if there are no immediate threats to a relationship,</p>
<p>but that the mate value discrepancy is a threat</p>
<p>that looms on the horizon of the relationship</p>
<p>because we know statistically,</p>
<p>the higher mate value person is more likely</p>
<p>to have an affair and is more likely</p>
<p>to dump the other person and trade up in the mating market.</p>
<p>And when people find new partners</p>
<p>for long-term relationships, do they tend to trade up?</p>
<p>On average, yes, if the discrepancy</p>
<p>is sufficiently large.</p>
<p>So there are costs associated with breaking up,</p>
<p>divorcing, for example.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s emotionally, financially,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a costly thing.</p>
<p>And so if you have like a half a point mate value</p>
<p>discrepancy, you&rsquo;re not gonna see a lot of breakups,</p>
<p>but if you have larger mate value discrepancies,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s gonna auger more for trading up</p>
<p>in the mating market.</p>
<p>So, but, so then you get into,</p>
<p>so what jealousy is, it&rsquo;s an emotion that gets activated</p>
<p>by these circumstances.</p>
<p>And then what people do about it</p>
<p>depends on what their options are.</p>
<p>And people do things that I,</p>
<p>in my published scientific work,</p>
<p>I say range from vigilance to violence.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a whole spectrum of things.</p>
<p>In fact, I&rsquo;ve identified 19 different tactics</p>
<p>that people use to deal with problems</p>
<p>once they get jealous.</p>
<p>And one is increased vigilance.</p>
<p>And the other is-</p>
<p>Vigilance for the behavior of the mate.</p>
<p>Yeah, vigilance for the behavior of the mate.</p>
<p>And that can include stalking, following,</p>
<p>hacking into iPhones or computers,</p>
<p>monitoring the behavior of mate poachers,</p>
<p>looking at eye contact between other men and your partner.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a whole suite of things</p>
<p>that is involved in vigilance.</p>
<p>And then at the other extreme,</p>
<p>and we can talk about things in between,</p>
<p>but the other extreme is violence.</p>
<p>And so in my new book,</p>
<p>When Men Behave Badly,</p>
<p>I have a whole chapter on intimate partner violence.</p>
<p>And this is what I argue,</p>
<p>and this is really unfortunate,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m not endorsing,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s illegal, it&rsquo;s bad, don&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>But people engage in intimate partner violence.</p>
<p>In America, something like 28 to 30%</p>
<p>of all people who are married</p>
<p>will experience intimate partner violence</p>
<p>in their relationship.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not a trivial percentage.</p>
<p>And that violence is between the two partners.</p>
<p>Between the two partners, yes.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also violence that gets directed</p>
<p>for potential mate poachers,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s a somewhat separate issue.</p>
<p>But one of the things that is functional about the violence</p>
<p>is that it tends to reduce</p>
<p>perceived mate value discrepancies.</p>
<p>So in other words, let&rsquo;s say it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>guys tend to engage in the violence more than women do,</p>
<p>although some argue that there&rsquo;s more equality</p>
<p>in the violence.</p>
<p>But at a minimum, men tend to do more damage</p>
<p>when they do the violence.</p>
<p>And when you&rsquo;re talking about violence,</p>
<p>is this ever emotional violence?</p>
<p>I mean-</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s that as well.</p>
<p>And in fact, the two tend to be correlated.</p>
<p>So in my studies of married couples,</p>
<p>verbal violence is a good predictor</p>
<p>of physical violence happening as well.</p>
<p>So one of the things that&rsquo;ll happen,</p>
<p>just to give a concrete example,</p>
<p>guys will start insulting their partner&rsquo;s appearance.</p>
<p>Hey, you&rsquo;re really looking ugly today.</p>
<p>Your thighs are heavy.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not looking very good.</p>
<p>So they try to denigrate the woman&rsquo;s appearance,</p>
<p>which is a key component of woman&rsquo;s mate value.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re trying to adjust more closely</p>
<p>the mate value discrepancy.</p>
<p>Yeah, they&rsquo;re trying to reduce</p>
<p>her self-perceived mate value.</p>
<p>So if let&rsquo;s say he&rsquo;s a six, she&rsquo;s an eight,</p>
<p>and he can convince her that she&rsquo;s actually only a six,</p>
<p>then she&rsquo;s gonna be more likely to stay with him.</p>
<p>Very diabolical.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s terribly diabolical.</p>
<p>But the fact is women don&rsquo;t feel good about themselves</p>
<p>when they get beaten up by their partner.</p>
<p>In fact, in the cases where it leaves physical evidence,</p>
<p>women wear sunglasses or turtlenecks</p>
<p>or cover up the bruises,</p>
<p>is it literally does lower the mate value of the woman</p>
<p>by injuring her physical appearance.</p>
<p>And getting her to conceal herself, stay home.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s taking her out of the,</p>
<p>literally reducing her visibility.</p>
<p>Right, and that&rsquo;s actually one of the predictors of violence</p>
<p>is if he starts doing things other than violence,</p>
<p>like cutting off her relationships</p>
<p>with her friends and her family,</p>
<p>trying to sequester her and prevent her</p>
<p>from getting exposed to potential other partners.</p>
<p>And so it is very diabolical,</p>
<p>but I think important to understand</p>
<p>the potential functionality of intimate partner violence.</p>
<p>What about, sorry to interrupt again,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m just so curious.</p>
<p>So oftentimes my audience will say interrupt too often,</p>
<p>but I wanna make sure that I don&rsquo;t miss an opportunity</p>
<p>to ask you about the intimate partner violence</p>
<p>in the other direction, female to male,</p>
<p>where stereotypically speaking,</p>
<p>that the opportunity for physical violence is still there,</p>
<p>but the idea in mind is that</p>
<p>it would be more of a psychological nature.</p>
<p>Although I think there is evidence</p>
<p>that some women beat their husbands,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m guessing it&rsquo;s not as frequent, or am I off?</p>
<p>Well, different studies.</p>
<p>So it depends on whether you just simply count up acts</p>
<p>or whether you look at the damage that&rsquo;s done, okay?</p>
<p>And as I mentioned, men tend to do more physical damage.</p>
<p>So there are shelters for battered women</p>
<p>all over the country.</p>
<p>As far as I know, there&rsquo;s one for battered men.</p>
<p>Now it may be, and this is partly true,</p>
<p>that men are more ashamed if they get beaten up</p>
<p>by their partner, clocked with a frying pan.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s possible, and there&rsquo;s evidence</p>
<p>that police don&rsquo;t take it as seriously.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s one case that I report in my book</p>
<p>where a guy called the police</p>
<p>and his wife had clocked him with something.</p>
<p>And police shows up and he says,</p>
<p>if she so much as broke a fingernail in this altercation,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll charge you and not her.</p>
<p>And so there is a police bias,</p>
<p>a potential police bias in this.</p>
<p>And so there may be under-reporting of women</p>
<p>beating up men as a consequence.</p>
<p>Okay, but the motivations are often different.</p>
<p>So one is that male sexual jealousy</p>
<p>will trigger him to attack his partner,</p>
<p>and then she will use physical violence to defend herself.</p>
<p>So she might pick up a frying pan</p>
<p>or a weapon of some sort to defend herself.</p>
<p>And so the motivation is his sexual jealousy on his part,</p>
<p>but self-defense on her part.</p>
<p>And so that accounts for some unknown percentage</p>
<p>of the cases.</p>
<p>And in some cases, it is women who were outraged</p>
<p>when they discover their partner&rsquo;s been having sex</p>
<p>with someone else, an infidelity of a sexual,</p>
<p>financial or emotional nature.</p>
<p>And so there is some female to male violence</p>
<p>that absolutely occurs.</p>
<p>But the reduction of a perceived mate value discrepancy</p>
<p>is a key function from male perspective.</p>
<p>Now, again, not that he thinks about this.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s just angry and wants to hurt her, okay?</p>
<p>Okay, but here&rsquo;s one other thing</p>
<p>that is really interesting</p>
<p>about the intimate partner violence,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s the specificity of it</p>
<p>depending on circumstances.</p>
<p>And namely, when the woman gets pregnant,</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s more vulnerable to physical violence.</p>
<p>And when the man suspects</p>
<p>that he&rsquo;s not the father of that pregnancy,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s more likely to direct the violence</p>
<p>toward blows to her abdomen, okay?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s specific.</p>
<p>And so in that case, the function is,</p>
<p>the hypothesized function is to terminate the pregnancy</p>
<p>by a rival male as opposed to deterring the woman</p>
<p>from committing an infidelity</p>
<p>or from leaving the relationship entirely.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why one function of intimate partner violence</p>
<p>is just sequestering the woman</p>
<p>and keeping her all to himself.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s both to prevent infidelity</p>
<p>and to prevent defection.</p>
<p>I have a friend whose wife told me</p>
<p>that if he cheats, I&rsquo;ll kill him, that&rsquo;s what she said,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s actually just much easier</p>
<p>to keep him very, very busy.</p>
<p>And that statement now leaps to mind</p>
<p>because of what you&rsquo;re describing,</p>
<p>that there are many tactics</p>
<p>by which people can engage this effort</p>
<p>to reduce the mate value discrepancy,</p>
<p>not all of which are overtly violent,</p>
<p>but all of which are designed to constrain their behavior.</p>
<p>Right, right, yeah, so these would fall</p>
<p>under what I would call mate retention tactics,</p>
<p>and only one or two of which</p>
<p>fall under the violence category.</p>
<p>Yeah, there are even, yeah,</p>
<p>within partner psychological manipulations</p>
<p>about these things.</p>
<p>So there are psychological manipulations</p>
<p>about perceived mate value.</p>
<p>You know, no one else would want you.</p>
<p>You know, you&rsquo;re a loser.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s denigration of partner within the relationship,</p>
<p>even feigning anger to make the partner feel guilty</p>
<p>about, say, looking at someone else.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s all kinds of internecine warfare</p>
<p>that goes on within relationships</p>
<p>to manipulate perceptions of these things.</p>
<p>This is, I&rsquo;m creating a much too jaded view</p>
<p>of romance and love, I think.</p>
<p>Oh, no, we will get to the happy endings and long,</p>
<p>I mean, there are certainly</p>
<p>many happy relationships out there.</p>
<p>Oh, you know, as a neuroscientist,</p>
<p>I hear about this and the immediacy</p>
<p>of how people, you know, fall into a pattern of jealousy</p>
<p>or a pattern of cheating, and not always,</p>
<p>but it just speaks to brain circuitry</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s evolved to protect something.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m sure this statement is not exhaustive,</p>
<p>but I think it&rsquo;s accurate to say that every species,</p>
<p>but especially humans, wants to make more of itself</p>
<p>and protect its young.</p>
<p>But these issues of paternity and resource allocation,</p>
<p>I mean, I think they&rsquo;re vital.</p>
<p>And, you know, I look forward to a day</p>
<p>where evolutionary psychology and neuroscience</p>
<p>can merge at the level of underlying mechanism.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s dark.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s just the way we&rsquo;re wired at some level.</p>
<p>Speaking of dark, could you tell us about the dark triad?</p>
<p>Yeah, so the dark triad,</p>
<p>so we&rsquo;ve been talking about sex differences on average,</p>
<p>but there are critical within sex individual differences.</p>
<p>And the dark triad is one of the most important ones.</p>
<p>The dark triad consists of three personality characteristics.</p>
<p>So narcissism, Machiavellianism, and psychopathy.</p>
<p>Hallmarks of narcissism are things like grandiosity,</p>
<p>a person thinks that they&rsquo;re more intelligent,</p>
<p>more attractive, more dazzling,</p>
<p>more charming than they actually are.</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;re the greatest person since sliced bread.</p>
<p>Importantly, with narcissism,</p>
<p>you also get a sense of entitlement.</p>
<p>So they feel entitled to a larger share of the pie,</p>
<p>whether that be the financial pie,</p>
<p>the status pie, or the sexual pie.</p>
<p>Machiavellianism is high scores tend to pursue</p>
<p>an exploitative social strategy.</p>
<p>So they might feign cooperation,</p>
<p>but then cheat on subsequent moves.</p>
<p>They view other people as pawns to be manipulated</p>
<p>for their own instrumental gains.</p>
<p>And then psychopathy,</p>
<p>one of the hallmarks of psychopathy is a lack of empathy.</p>
<p>So most people have a normal empathy circuit</p>
<p>where if a child falls down and gets hurt,</p>
<p>we feel compassion for the harm</p>
<p>that that person is undergoing.</p>
<p>Or if a puppy gets hit by a car or whatever,</p>
<p>we feel compassion.</p>
<p>Psychopaths don&rsquo;t, that is those high on this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a dimensional thing, it&rsquo;s not a categorical thing.</p>
<p>So those high on psychopathy basically lack empathy.</p>
<p>And so if you combine these qualities,</p>
<p>narcissism, psychopathy, and Machiavellianism,</p>
<p>you have some very bad dudes.</p>
<p>And I say bad dudes,</p>
<p>because men tend to score higher in these things than women,</p>
<p>especially on the psychopathy dimension.</p>
<p>So when you talk about clinical levels of psychopathy,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s estimated to be something like 1% of women</p>
<p>and about 4% of men.</p>
<p>So men are much higher on that.</p>
<p>So why is this important?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s important in the mating context</p>
<p>because those who are high on dark triad traits</p>
<p>tend to be sexual deceivers, for one.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re very often very charming,</p>
<p>very good at seducing women and then abandoning them,</p>
<p>sometimes after fleecing them or draining their bank account.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re very good at the art of seduction.</p>
<p>They also tend to be sexual harassers,</p>
<p>serial sexual harassers, and sexual coercers.</p>
<p>So when it comes to forms of sexual violence,</p>
<p>high dark triad guys tend to be perpetrators of this.</p>
<p>And so like most men,</p>
<p>I think would find it ethically abhorrent</p>
<p>to sexually harass, say, a woman in the workplace.</p>
<p>Dark triad guys, in part, maybe they feel entitled to it.</p>
<p>And in part, they do.</p>
<p>I mean, in some cases that I report in the book,</p>
<p>there are like literal descriptions</p>
<p>where the guys are writing in these journals,</p>
<p>oh, I knew she was attracted to me.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why she met me in the Xerox room</p>
<p>just when I was there</p>
<p>because she wanted to admire my bulging biceps or whatever.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all about them.</p>
<p>Yeah, and this gets into a bias that I talk about,</p>
<p>which is the male sexual misperception bias,</p>
<p>where a woman smiles at a man,</p>
<p>man thinks, oh, she wants my body, she&rsquo;s attracted to me,</p>
<p>and women are thinking, oh, I&rsquo;m just being friendly,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m being polite or professional.</p>
<p>But these guys, high dark triad guys,</p>
<p>are more susceptible to the sexual over-perception bias,</p>
<p>and they literally believe</p>
<p>that the woman is attracted to them</p>
<p>and sending them signals, green lights,</p>
<p>to sexually approach.</p>
<p>And so if you combine dark triad traits</p>
<p>with the dispositional pursuit</p>
<p>of a short-term mating strategy,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s an especially deadly combination.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when you get sexual harassment, sexual coercion.</p>
<p>So these are very bad dudes,</p>
<p>also predictors of intimate partner violence.</p>
<p>What approximate frequency in the male population</p>
<p>have all three of the dark triad traits?</p>
<p>And I realize that they&rsquo;re on a continuum,</p>
<p>sociopathy and narcissism.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s why you can&rsquo;t say it,</p>
<p>because they are on a continuum,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s sort of arbitrary where you draw the line.</p>
<p>But I think it&rsquo;s a minority of men,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a subset of men who commit the vast majority</p>
<p>of these acts of sexual violence.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s not like,</p>
<p>if you look at victims of sexual violence,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re more numerous</p>
<p>than the perpetrators of sexual violence,</p>
<p>because the perpetrators tend to be serial offenders,</p>
<p>so to speak.</p>
<p>One guy in the workplace harassing 15 different women,</p>
<p>one guy sexually coercing multiple women.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why you have,</p>
<p>in well-known cases in the news like Harvey Weinstein,</p>
<p>probably over a hundred different women.</p>
<p>Bill Cosby, Jeffrey Epstein,</p>
<p>some of these more famous cases,</p>
<p>these are a large number of victims,</p>
<p>but pretty much sole perpetrators.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s no question that these guys,</p>
<p>like Harvey Weinstein and Jeffrey Epstein</p>
<p>were definitely high on dark triad traits.</p>
<p>You mentioned stalking briefly.</p>
<p>Maybe we could just talk about</p>
<p>some of the less known features about stalking.</p>
<p>I think I once heard you give a lecture</p>
<p>where you said that one of the scariest things</p>
<p>about stalking is that sometimes it works.</p>
<p>Yes, yeah.</p>
<p>So, well, stalking has multiple motivations,</p>
<p>but one of the most frequent motivations</p>
<p>is a mating motivation,</p>
<p>where either there&rsquo;s a breakup</p>
<p>and the woman dumps the guy</p>
<p>and the guy doesn&rsquo;t want to get dumped.</p>
<p>He wants to maintain a relationship with her.</p>
<p>And I should say that when it comes to criminal stalking,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a huge sex difference.</p>
<p>About 80% of the stalkers tend to be men,</p>
<p>about 20% women.</p>
<p>So there are women stalkers,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re about a fourth the number compared to men.</p>
<p>So the motivation of the guys</p>
<p>tends to be either an attempt</p>
<p>to get back together with the woman,</p>
<p>either sexually or in a relationship,</p>
<p>and or to interfere with her future mating prospects.</p>
<p>And it works in some of the time in two senses.</p>
<p>One is it does interfere with her attempts to remate.</p>
<p>So in fact, it scares off some guys.</p>
<p>So like you show up and pick up a woman</p>
<p>at her apartment for a date</p>
<p>and her ex is sitting out there glaring at you.</p>
<p>Or, and I&rsquo;m actually familiar with the circumstance</p>
<p>where early in a relationship,</p>
<p>somebody mentions that an ex has made veiled threats</p>
<p>about surveillance, for instance.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve actually had that happen several times</p>
<p>in my dating history where someone would say,</p>
<p>you know, you started opening up</p>
<p>about previous relationships a little bit</p>
<p>as it&rsquo;s appropriate.</p>
<p>And someone says, yeah, you know,</p>
<p>he mentioned that he was going to, you know,</p>
<p>send someone around to, you know, to surveil me,</p>
<p>you know, that kind of thing,</p>
<p>which is a very interesting factoid to pick up in,</p>
<p>but I heard it enough times and people I know</p>
<p>have reported hearing this enough times</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m guessing that that&rsquo;s probably more frequent</p>
<p>than people actually trailing people in cars</p>
<p>and things of that sort.</p>
<p>But planting that, it&rsquo;s like the psychological seed</p>
<p>of surveillance is a form of harassment in some sense.</p>
<p>Yes, absolutely.</p>
<p>I think that you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s that planting the psychological seeds,</p>
<p>but then also with surveillance,</p>
<p>some surveillors remain hidden,</p>
<p>so you don&rsquo;t know necessarily.</p>
<p>Yeah, I confess in this case,</p>
<p>it did not act as a deterrent</p>
<p>for continuing the relationship,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s another story.</p>
<p>So how often do women respond,</p>
<p>I have to put this in quotes,</p>
<p>for those that are listening, air quotes, end quotes,</p>
<p>positively to stalking?</p>
<p>I mean, how often does it work to re-secure the partner</p>
<p>after they&rsquo;ve been broken up?</p>
<p>Well, so in our studies,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a minority of cases that it works to re-establish.</p>
<p>I think something like 15% of the time</p>
<p>that it works either to temporarily re-establish</p>
<p>a sexual relationship or lure the woman back in</p>
<p>for a more permanent relationship.</p>
<p>So most of the time it doesn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>But one woman in our study said the guy,</p>
<p>every time she went out with another guy,</p>
<p>he would threaten the other guy.</p>
<p>And she said after about six months,</p>
<p>there were no other guys.</p>
<p>He basically scared off all the other guys.</p>
<p>And so she went back to him</p>
<p>because there were no other guys around.</p>
<p>Yeah, I experienced this when I was in college.</p>
<p>I lived in a small town, very population dense,</p>
<p>Isla Vista, UC Santa Barbara.</p>
<p>And there was a couple where every time</p>
<p>this woman would date someone,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;d basically beat up whoever the new suitor was.</p>
<p>And pretty soon no one would go near them.</p>
<p>They got a reputation as the kind of sit-in Nancy couple.</p>
<p>And indeed it worked.</p>
<p>It worked in the sense that no one dared go near her</p>
<p>and they ended up together.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve seen real life examples of this.</p>
<p>Yeah, so it happens.</p>
<p>But it is in general not a successful strategy.</p>
<p>Oh no, and it&rsquo;s not what I&rsquo;m suggesting.</p>
<p>I was just shocked to learn that,</p>
<p>because we hear stalking and we have this,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s one very extreme image of it.</p>
<p>But the underlying motivations, I think are,</p>
<p>reveal something about mating dynamics.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I think that the circumstances</p>
<p>are often a mate value discrepancy</p>
<p>where the guy realizes correctly</p>
<p>that he will be unable to replace her</p>
<p>with a mate of equivalent mate value,</p>
<p>or in some cases, any mate.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s like, well, she was with me once.</p>
<p>Maybe I can get her back with me again.</p>
<p>So the psychology is very understandable,</p>
<p>but it tends not to work,</p>
<p>because, I mean, another thing we found,</p>
<p>we did a study of 2,500 victims of stalking.</p>
<p>This is with Josh Duntley, a former student of mine</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s now a professor in a criminology department.</p>
<p>And what we found is there were large sex,</p>
<p>large differences between the stalker</p>
<p>and the victim of the stalker,</p>
<p>where the stalker tends to be much lower</p>
<p>in mate value than the victim.</p>
<p>And so basically, it&rsquo;s typically the woman</p>
<p>who realizes she can do a lot better on the mating market,</p>
<p>and the guy realizes,</p>
<p>I am never gonna be able to replace her</p>
<p>with a woman of equivalent mate value.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m gonna use this last-ditch, desperate measure</p>
<p>to try to get her back, and occasionally it works.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m thinking more about this mate value thing,</p>
<p>this number, this metric, the eight, 10, six,</p>
<p>whatever it is, and mate value discrepancy</p>
<p>playing such a strong role in all these dynamics.</p>
<p>I should have asked this earlier,</p>
<p>but what is the impact on mate value, perceived or real,</p>
<p>of a woman having already had children?</p>
<p>For instance, friends of mine who are married and divorced</p>
<p>who have children will often post pictures of themselves</p>
<p>with their children in their online profiles</p>
<p>because it shows a strong sense of paternal instinct.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the puppy thing, people with dogs or puppies</p>
<p>demonstrating a capacity to care and for caretaking.</p>
<p>In women, the opposite is also true.</p>
<p>Women with children show capacity,</p>
<p>it demonstrates fertility, at least at one point,</p>
<p>perhaps still fertility that&rsquo;s still present.</p>
<p>Does it positively, negatively, or neutrally impact</p>
<p>a woman to already have children when seeking another mate,</p>
<p>regardless of whether or not she was married</p>
<p>or had the children out of wedlock?</p>
<p>Yeah, as a general rule, it decreases her mate value</p>
<p>because kids with another mate are viewed as a cost,</p>
<p>not a benefit, and they&rsquo;re a cost on multiple dimensions.</p>
<p>One of which, they&rsquo;re gonna be a cost to the guy</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s gonna have to invest resources,</p>
<p>time, attention, and so forth,</p>
<p>but also a portion of her effort and resources</p>
<p>are gonna be devoted toward kids</p>
<p>who are not genetically related to him,</p>
<p>which is one reason why stepfamilies,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s often a lot of conflict within stepfamilies,</p>
<p>very explicable from an evolutionary perspective.</p>
<p>So in general, it&rsquo;s a cost, not a benefit.</p>
<p>Sometimes it can be a benefit, though.</p>
<p>I know of one case where a woman got divorced,</p>
<p>she had two kids, and she ended up successfully mating</p>
<p>with a guy who was also divorced</p>
<p>and had primary custody of his two kids.</p>
<p>And so there was a compatibility there.</p>
<p>But as a general rule, it will decrease a woman&rsquo;s</p>
<p>and a man&rsquo;s mate value to have kids,</p>
<p>especially kids who are financially,</p>
<p>who are young and financially dependent.</p>
<p>But what happens is, let&rsquo;s say the woman</p>
<p>would be an eight without kids.</p>
<p>A guy who&rsquo;s a six might be able to attract her</p>
<p>and might feel lucky to attract her</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s no way he would have been able</p>
<p>to attract her under other conditions.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s why the display of effort investing in her kids</p>
<p>is often a mating tactic.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s showing, okay, I&rsquo;m willing to invest in kids,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m willing to sacrifice.</p>
<p>And so they, in essence, become equivalent in mate value</p>
<p>as a result of that.</p>
<p>But will she be able to attract, on average,</p>
<p>you know, other eights?</p>
<p>Less likely.</p>
<p>But the same is true of guys.</p>
<p>And this is why the reason that affects women more than men</p>
<p>is because more custody tends to go with women.</p>
<p>That is, women tend to have greater custody,</p>
<p>and women tend to invest more in the kids</p>
<p>throughout their lives.</p>
<p>Now, there are other things like alimony</p>
<p>and child support payments and so forth,</p>
<p>but all the women I&rsquo;ve talked to,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked to one-on-one with many women about this,</p>
<p>they view a guy with kids as a cost, not a benefit,</p>
<p>unless the kids are old enough and they&rsquo;ve left home</p>
<p>and are no longer financially dependent.</p>
<p>And everything you just described is consistent</p>
<p>with what you said earlier,</p>
<p>which is that with subsequent marriages</p>
<p>or as men get older,</p>
<p>the tendency is to seek mates</p>
<p>that are progressively younger, right?</p>
<p>Because there&rsquo;s a lower probability</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll already have children if they&rsquo;re much younger.</p>
<p>Right, right, and if the guy&rsquo;s successful,</p>
<p>if he has status and resources</p>
<p>and has other qualities associated with higher mate value,</p>
<p>then he will remain attractive to younger women.</p>
<p>I realize it&rsquo;s not your specific area of expertise,</p>
<p>but these days there&rsquo;s a lot of discussion</p>
<p>about how early childhood attachment to parents</p>
<p>influences mate choice later on,</p>
<p>this kind of general categorization of avoidant</p>
<p>and anxious and anxious avoidant and all this kind of thing.</p>
<p>And again, putting my hat on as a neuroscientist,</p>
<p>I think it makes sense that the neural circuits</p>
<p>for attachment in childhood would be somehow,</p>
<p>partially or in whole,</p>
<p>repurposed for other forms of attachment.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t just tend to say,</p>
<p>okay, that brain circuitry was for when I was a kid</p>
<p>and now I&rsquo;m an adult</p>
<p>and so I&rsquo;ll develop this new attachment circuitry.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m guessing it evolves and whatnot.</p>
<p>But is there anything interesting</p>
<p>about childhood attachment strategies</p>
<p>vis-a-vis stability of long-term partner choice</p>
<p>or is that too big of a leap for us to make here?</p>
<p>Yeah, well, I mean, I can offer</p>
<p>some sort of informed speculation about it.</p>
<p>And as you point out, it&rsquo;s not my area of expertise,</p>
<p>but I know a little bit about it.</p>
<p>And I mean, I think that a secure attachment style,</p>
<p>if both partners have a secure attachment style,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s conducive to a long-term mateship.</p>
<p>Avoidant attachment styles,</p>
<p>avoidant people tend to have more difficulty with intimacy</p>
<p>and also higher probability of infidelity.</p>
<p>And anxious attachment style,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, can create problems of its own</p>
<p>in the overly clingy, dependent, absorbing,</p>
<p>what I call high relationship load.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s like mutation load,</p>
<p>which we all have a certain number of mutations.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s parasite load.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also what I call relationship load.</p>
<p>So what is the baggage that someone brings</p>
<p>to the relationship?</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re probably correlated with the frequency</p>
<p>of demand of immediate text message responses.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>The frequency of demand,</p>
<p>like the expected low latency of text message responses</p>
<p>plays out consistently in relationships.</p>
<p>Early on, there&rsquo;s a very low expectation of response.</p>
<p>And then as people get attached,</p>
<p>depending on their level of anxiety,</p>
<p>if they don&rsquo;t hear back from somebody really quickly,</p>
<p>where the mind goes is a very interesting aspect.</p>
<p>Do you become suspicious?</p>
<p>Do you become anxious?</p>
<p>Can you stabilize your own internal milieu?</p>
<p>Or do you need to see the dot, dot, dot</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s coming back?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to see a study on that at some point.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>No, that&rsquo;s a good one.</p>
<p>And my intuition suggests that your prediction</p>
<p>about that would pan out.</p>
<p>It would be the insecure that would really be,</p>
<p>you know, getting upset if there were not</p>
<p>that immediate response to the text.</p>
<p>Yeah, I have a friend, a female friend,</p>
<p>who deliberately, quote unquote,</p>
<p>using her language trains her potential partners</p>
<p>to be comfortable with a variable response latency.</p>
<p>But then I asked her if she&rsquo;s comfortable</p>
<p>with a variable response latency,</p>
<p>and she said, absolutely not.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s an asymmetry, at least in that case.</p>
<p>This is almost certainly a more rare circumstance,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;d be remiss if I didn&rsquo;t ask</p>
<p>about unconventional relationships.</p>
<p>These days, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s just by virtue</p>
<p>of living in California.</p>
<p>You hear more and more about monogamish,</p>
<p>as opposed to monogamous.</p>
<p>And various forms of polyamory</p>
<p>that may or may not include the amory part.</p>
<p>You know, passes and permission,</p>
<p>based on season, circumstance, and prior infidelities.</p>
<p>Like, okay, somebody had a mishap early on,</p>
<p>you know, you have one pass, so to speak.</p>
<p>And you hear this kind of language getting thrown around.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s intriguing to me because it seems like an effort</p>
<p>to bypass some of the more, if you will,</p>
<p>hardwired, or at least culturally hardwired aspects</p>
<p>of mate choice and sexual partner choice.</p>
<p>You know, acknowledging jealousy,</p>
<p>but confronting it by allowing your partner</p>
<p>to be with somebody else, for instance.</p>
<p>I confess I have friends</p>
<p>who have unconventional relationships.</p>
<p>I have friends with conventional relationships.</p>
<p>Any thoughts on polyamory?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, I do have a couple thoughts on it.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t studied it extensively,</p>
<p>but I think that the way I would phrase it</p>
<p>is that there&rsquo;s an attempt to overcome</p>
<p>certain evolved features of our mating psychology,</p>
<p>but often in the service</p>
<p>of other aspects of our mating psychology.</p>
<p>So what I mean by that is this.</p>
<p>So talk about polyamory,</p>
<p>first of all, there&rsquo;s a sex difference on average.</p>
<p>That is, men are more likely</p>
<p>to want to initiate a polyamorous relationship than women.</p>
<p>There are lots of exceptions,</p>
<p>and I actually know of at least one exception personally,</p>
<p>friends of mine who are in a polyamorous relationship.</p>
<p>But the motivation for men</p>
<p>is that evolved desire for sexual variety.</p>
<p>So it gives him access to a wider variety of sex partners,</p>
<p>which is part of our evolved sexual psychology,</p>
<p>especially for men.</p>
<p>Women, one motivation,</p>
<p>now women also have a desire for sexual variety.</p>
<p>On average, tends not to be as great as that of men,</p>
<p>but also have it.</p>
<p>But some women agree to a polyamorous relationship</p>
<p>as a mate retention tactic.</p>
<p>That is, this guy, in order to keep him,</p>
<p>she has to agree to the relationship.</p>
<p>And so the motivations for engaging in polyamory</p>
<p>are somewhat sex differentiated.</p>
<p>On average.</p>
<p>On average, on average.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s lots of exceptions.</p>
<p>So now when it comes to sexual jealousy,</p>
<p>there is this recognition that there,</p>
<p>and in my, the way that I would frame it,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s this evolved emotion</p>
<p>where we, it triggers sexual jealousy,</p>
<p>seeing your partner having sex,</p>
<p>or imagining your partner having sex,</p>
<p>or falling in love with someone else.</p>
<p>And, but interestingly,</p>
<p>and there haven&rsquo;t been studies on this,</p>
<p>but I know of this one polyamorous couple</p>
<p>where they reported to me,</p>
<p>both of them reported to me,</p>
<p>and she said she doesn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t bother her at all if her husband,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re married, has sex with other women.</p>
<p>She, they allow it.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s like every Thursday night or whatever,</p>
<p>they have the different couples have different rules.</p>
<p>But one time she saw him walking down the street</p>
<p>hand in hand affectionately with a former girlfriend,</p>
<p>and she got extremely jealous.</p>
<p>So because it signaled an emotional connection.</p>
<p>So the sexual didn&rsquo;t bother her,</p>
<p>the emotional did.</p>
<p>She happens to be bisexual,</p>
<p>and she and her partner said that it really upset him</p>
<p>when she slept with other men,</p>
<p>but it was fine if she slept with other women.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a fairly common thing</p>
<p>that among the men that I know</p>
<p>that are in polyamorous relationships,</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s a fairly common statement.</p>
<p>Yeah, so he kept trying to,</p>
<p>these internecine manipulations</p>
<p>trying to encourage her to sleep with other women,</p>
<p>but not with men.</p>
<p>And in her case, encouraging him</p>
<p>not to get emotionally involved with other women,</p>
<p>but the sex was okay.</p>
<p>So I think that, you know,</p>
<p>I think that in the modern environment, you know,</p>
<p>we have a very rich and complicated evolve mating psychology</p>
<p>and what we&rsquo;re doing in these novel forms</p>
<p>or semi-novel,</p>
<p>because these things have a pretty deep history themselves,</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re attempting to maximize</p>
<p>some of our evolved desires</p>
<p>while keeping quiescent other evolved aspects</p>
<p>of our sexual psychology, like jealousy.</p>
<p>So satisfying our desire for sexual variety,</p>
<p>but keeping jealousy at bay.</p>
<p>And different couples do it in different ways.</p>
<p>So as you alluded to,</p>
<p>so I know one couple where live in Los Angeles</p>
<p>and the woman from the woman said,</p>
<p>she gives her husband permission to have an affair,</p>
<p>sleep with other women</p>
<p>as long as it&rsquo;s outside of the city limits of LA.</p>
<p>And this other couple it&rsquo;s has to be Thursday night,</p>
<p>you know, and so different people have different-</p>
<p>So there are constraints on,</p>
<p>but the constraints are specific</p>
<p>and somewhat arbitrary to the relationship.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re specific and often in polyamorous relations,</p>
<p>people talk it out and come to an agreement</p>
<p>on what is acceptable and what&rsquo;s out of bounds.</p>
<p>So, but in a way, I mean, in a way it&rsquo;s just,</p>
<p>we can&rsquo;t change our evolved sexual psychology,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think.</p>
<p>What we can do is we can activate certain elements of it</p>
<p>and keep others quiescent.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s all good.</p>
<p>And in a way we do in the modern environment,</p>
<p>so even to take it outside of polyamory, pornography.</p>
<p>Okay, widely consumed internet pornography.</p>
<p>What does that do?</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s a big sex difference there.</p>
<p>Men tend to consume it a lot more than women.</p>
<p>The forms of the pornography are different,</p>
<p>but in a way the pornography,</p>
<p>what it does is it parasitize men&rsquo;s evolved desire</p>
<p>for sexual variety.</p>
<p>So they can, in some sense,</p>
<p>psychologically experience sexual variety</p>
<p>of different women sexually without actually doing it</p>
<p>by just looking at their computer screen.</p>
<p>And so in a way, another way of phrasing that</p>
<p>is that we create modern novel cultural inventions</p>
<p>in ways that satisfy our evolved desires</p>
<p>and our evolved sexual desires.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s interesting with the kind of explosion</p>
<p>of online pornography.</p>
<p>I have a colleague at Stanford in psychiatry,</p>
<p>Anna Lemke, who studies the dopamine system.</p>
<p>And she mentioned two things of interest.</p>
<p>One is that not only is there a tremendous variety</p>
<p>of experiences that are available to people</p>
<p>who view in pornography,</p>
<p>but the intensity is also quite high.</p>
<p>So much so that, at least for young people</p>
<p>who are observing a lot of pornography,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s possible, and there are studies looking at this now,</p>
<p>that their brain circuits become wired</p>
<p>to observing sexual acts as opposed to being engaged in them,</p>
<p>which can be extremely problematic.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a sharp blade, so to speak.</p>
<p>This pornography thing, it isn&rsquo;t what it once was,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s evolving quickly.</p>
<p>Very interesting.</p>
<p>So how should one frame all this?</p>
<p>So I imagine a number of people listening</p>
<p>are in relationships or would hope to be in a relationship.</p>
<p>In terms of understanding what we are selecting</p>
<p>for consciously or subconsciously,</p>
<p>it seems like there are common themes.</p>
<p>People want to feel attractive and attracted.</p>
<p>People want to make sure that there&rsquo;s stability</p>
<p>of the relationship.</p>
<p>So when we hear about security,</p>
<p>oftentimes I think of this kind of warm oxytocin,</p>
<p>serotonin-like thing.</p>
<p>But this mate value thing seems so powerful in all this,</p>
<p>assessing mate value.</p>
<p>So how objective are people about assessing their own value</p>
<p>in terms of finding, securing,</p>
<p>and over time maintaining a relationship?</p>
<p>Securing is dynamic because people age at different rates.</p>
<p>Is there an objective metric of this stuff?</p>
<p>I guess you get a lot of statistics about somebody&rsquo;s image</p>
<p>and you come up with an average value</p>
<p>based on the population.</p>
<p>But how should people assess themselves?</p>
<p>Because it seems like one of the features</p>
<p>that would be very powerful for leading to happiness</p>
<p>of good partner selection, that&rsquo;s stable,</p>
<p>where one doesn&rsquo;t have to resort</p>
<p>to these Machiavellian or diabolical</p>
<p>or any of these other strategies,</p>
<p>would be to be very honest with oneself.</p>
<p>And how does one do that?</p>
<p>Yeah, great questions.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think that the science has all the answers.</p>
<p>So a couple of things.</p>
<p>So one is that I think people are generally pretty good</p>
<p>at self-assessing mate value.</p>
<p>And even self-esteem has been hypothesized</p>
<p>to be one internal monitoring device</p>
<p>that tracks mate value.</p>
<p>So when we get a promotion at work</p>
<p>or we get a rise in status,</p>
<p>we feel an elevated sense of self-esteem.</p>
<p>We get fired, we get rejected,</p>
<p>we get ostracized, our self-esteem plummets.</p>
<p>So our self-evaluation, I think,</p>
<p>does track mate value to some extent.</p>
<p>There are people who overestimate their mate value,</p>
<p>people high on narcissism in particular,</p>
<p>and some people underestimate their mate value.</p>
<p>Another important element</p>
<p>is that there&rsquo;s consensual mate value.</p>
<p>So that is, if you asked a group of 100 people,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s fair amount of consensus</p>
<p>that this person&rsquo;s an eight, that person&rsquo;s a six.</p>
<p>But there are also individual differences in mate value.</p>
<p>So one example is I know a woman who&rsquo;s a professor</p>
<p>and she places a high premium on guys</p>
<p>who are deeply steeped in Russian literature,</p>
<p>which she is, so that she can have</p>
<p>in-depth conversations about Russian literature.</p>
<p>Note to young men, learn Russian literature.</p>
<p>Well, but this is high</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a dimension of mate value</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s important for her,</p>
<p>but probably not important for a lot of other people.</p>
<p>And so, whereas other people, let&rsquo;s say,</p>
<p>might be, let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re into football</p>
<p>or some sport, then,</p>
<p>and another partner thinks sports are stupid,</p>
<p>you know, then that&rsquo;s, you know,</p>
<p>someone who&rsquo;s also into sports</p>
<p>is gonna be higher in mate value for you.</p>
<p>So there are these individual differences</p>
<p>in components of mate value, which is good,</p>
<p>because that means if everyone were going</p>
<p>after the same people</p>
<p>and there was total consensus on mate value,</p>
<p>then there would be a lot of mateless people</p>
<p>and a lot of problems in the world,</p>
<p>and a lot of dissatisfied people.</p>
<p>So both are important.</p>
<p>The consensual aspects</p>
<p>and the individually differentiated components</p>
<p>of mate value.</p>
<p>But in terms of accuracy of assessment,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s, there are no good measures scientifically</p>
<p>to do this because it&rsquo;s sufficiently complicated.</p>
<p>So I mentioned, you know,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve mentioned maybe a dozen different components</p>
<p>of mate value, physical attractiveness,</p>
<p>kindness, emotional stability,</p>
<p>health status, et cetera.</p>
<p>And these aren&rsquo;t the only ones.</p>
<p>So I teach a course on psychology of human mating,</p>
<p>and I ask the people,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a large course, a couple hundred people,</p>
<p>tell me, what do women want in a mate?</p>
<p>And so I started with the blackboard.</p>
<p>This is back in the old days</p>
<p>when there was a blackboard, a piece of chalk,</p>
<p>and they said, I want a mate who has a good sense of humor.</p>
<p>Sorry, sense of humor.</p>
<p>Intelligent, right?</p>
<p>Kind.</p>
<p>And so I go through this</p>
<p>and I go through five blackboards</p>
<p>and then I run out of space over what women want.</p>
<p>Now I do the same for men</p>
<p>and men kind of run out of space</p>
<p>after about a blackboard and a half.</p>
<p>But what that tells me is that</p>
<p>these qualities are large in number</p>
<p>and complicated in nature.</p>
<p>So you say you want a guy who&rsquo;s nice and generous.</p>
<p>They say, yeah.</p>
<p>So like a guy who at the end of every month</p>
<p>takes his whole paycheck</p>
<p>and gives it to the wino, a homeless person.</p>
<p>Well, no, not that generous.</p>
<p>Generous toward me, but not toward everyone else.</p>
<p>Nice in general, but not so nice</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re getting exploited.</p>
<p>So, or even, now there&rsquo;s something,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t be too healthy.</p>
<p>So people, that&rsquo;s unidimensional.</p>
<p>But you want a guy, women want a guy who&rsquo;s confident,</p>
<p>but not too confident.</p>
<p>Because too confident will mean</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s either arrogant, narcissistic,</p>
<p>or not sufficiently manipulable.</p>
<p>So anyway, so my point is that</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s so many different components of mate value</p>
<p>and that they vary in amount,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s not just listing the qualities</p>
<p>and summing them up.</p>
<p>They vary in amount.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very complicated endeavor to assess accurately.</p>
<p>But I think people have a good intuitive sense</p>
<p>of people&rsquo;s relative mate value,</p>
<p>especially if you&rsquo;re in a group</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve been able to interact with them for a long time.</p>
<p>And one indication is, again, that attention structure.</p>
<p>How many other people really want to mate with this person?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good cue that they&rsquo;re high in mate value.</p>
<p>Nobody wants to mate with you,</p>
<p>then cue that you&rsquo;re low in mate value.</p>
<p>Reminds me of the time when one is trying to decide</p>
<p>who to ask to the prom.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s a complicated assessment</p>
<p>based on who one would like to go with,</p>
<p>whether or not you&rsquo;re already partnered,</p>
<p>who would say yes, who would say no,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s a risk in rejection, too,</p>
<p>because that, if I&rsquo;m guessing correctly,</p>
<p>could lower one&rsquo;s own perceived mate value.</p>
<p>Yeah, getting rejected.</p>
<p>Right, frequency of rejections</p>
<p>probably doesn&rsquo;t lend itself well</p>
<p>to increasing one&rsquo;s own view of their mate value.</p>
<p>Right, which is why many guys</p>
<p>have what I call mating anxiety.</p>
<p>That is, they don&rsquo;t approach one</p>
<p>because they risk getting shot down.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re trying to maintain that number</p>
<p>by reducing the amount of data.</p>
<p>Right. Yeah.</p>
<p>Very interesting.</p>
<p>But it backfires in the modern environment.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a famous psychologist, Albert Ellis,</p>
<p>who had mating anxiety,</p>
<p>and he assigned himself the task of approaching,</p>
<p>asking, like, I can&rsquo;t remember what the number was,</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s say 50 women out on dates.</p>
<p>He lived in New York City, so there were a lot of women.</p>
<p>He could just stand still and they would stream past.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And he assigned himself, like,</p>
<p>ask 50 women on a date, you know, every week.</p>
<p>And he said, after two weeks, his mating anxiety disappeared</p>
<p>because most of them said, buzz off, creep.</p>
<p>But he decided, oh, actually getting rejected</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t cause my world to collapse,</p>
<p>and it actually was okay.</p>
<p>And so he kind of inured himself to this rejection.</p>
<p>And so it ended up,</p>
<p>he ended up doing quite well in his mating life.</p>
<p>Another point for cognitive behavioral desensitization.</p>
<p>Yes, exactly.</p>
<p>He ran the experiment.</p>
<p>Just a couple more questions.</p>
<p>Earlier, you mentioned self-deception-based deception,</p>
<p>or something of that sort, self-deception,</p>
<p>that people aren&rsquo;t always trying to convince somebody else</p>
<p>of something that secretly they know isn&rsquo;t true,</p>
<p>but that they deceive themselves.</p>
<p>Could you embellish on that a little bit?</p>
<p>Yeah, so, well, this is actually,</p>
<p>this hypothesis is the famous evolutionary biologist,</p>
<p>Robert Trivers, first advanced this hypothesis</p>
<p>in the preface in 1976 to Dawkins&rsquo; book,</p>
<p>The Selfish Gene.</p>
<p>And he subsequently written more about it,</p>
<p>both in scientific article and in a more popular book.</p>
<p>But the idea is that if,</p>
<p>the core idea is that successful deception</p>
<p>is facilitated by self-deception.</p>
<p>So if you really believe that an X,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re gonna be a more successful salesman</p>
<p>to convince other people of X.</p>
<p>So if you believe you&rsquo;re, let&rsquo;s say, a 10 in mate value,</p>
<p>you truly believe it, even if you&rsquo;re not,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna have a more successful time</p>
<p>convincing you that I am as well.</p>
<p>And so the hypothesis is basically that people self-deceive</p>
<p>in order to increase the effectiveness of actual deception.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>But I think that there are people</p>
<p>who are, so one other dimension I&rsquo;ll mention to</p>
<p>is that animals often take each other</p>
<p>at our own word for things.</p>
<p>So if we&rsquo;re self-confident,</p>
<p>people assume that we must have the goods</p>
<p>to back up that self-confidence.</p>
<p>If we&rsquo;re a quivering mass of insecurity,</p>
<p>people believe, well,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t have the goods to back up anything, you know.</p>
<p>And so people use other people&rsquo;s displays</p>
<p>of their self-confidence as a cue to their goods.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s, in general, a pretty reliable cue,</p>
<p>but then there are overestimates and underestimates</p>
<p>as we&rsquo;ve talked about, like with narcissism.</p>
<p>Yeah, we see this with the job candidates.</p>
<p>You know, you are taught to look very carefully</p>
<p>at the application and consider all aspects.</p>
<p>But ultimately, you consider that also in light of,</p>
<p>you know, how firmly someone believes in the vision</p>
<p>of what they&rsquo;re trying to bring to the profession.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, I think, largely a subconscious process</p>
<p>and being aware of it can be helpful.</p>
<p>But yeah, when somebody&rsquo;s confident,</p>
<p>you tend to think that they&rsquo;re going to get</p>
<p>where they say they&rsquo;re going to go.</p>
<p>And it acts as a bit of a heuristic for not needing,</p>
<p>the impulse is that one then doesn&rsquo;t need to go vet</p>
<p>all the information quite as carefully.</p>
<p>But I guess if one is aware of it,</p>
<p>then you know to dig deeper</p>
<p>because it seems like there&rsquo;s a lot of deception going on.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Well, and you know, and something we talked about earlier,</p>
<p>people high on psychopathy are very good at deception.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know whether they are good at self-deception</p>
<p>or whether they&rsquo;re just really good deceivers, you know?</p>
<p>So, but they can be very effective.</p>
<p>And out in California, you know, you live out in California,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve seen your fair share of cases like that.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, I think across today&rsquo;s discussion</p>
<p>and various examples pop to mind</p>
<p>of seeing these features in humans.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so interesting.</p>
<p>I find the work that you do incredibly interesting.</p>
<p>I think this field of evolutionary psychology</p>
<p>is fascinating and I hope, I said it before,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ll say it again.</p>
<p>I feel like neuroscience and evolutionary psychology</p>
<p>are nudging towards one another.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s only a matter of time</p>
<p>before they merge in some formal way.</p>
<p>I mean, there is the work, for instance,</p>
<p>on polygamous versus monogamous prairie voles</p>
<p>and levels of vasopressin,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a big leap to go from vasopressin</p>
<p>in a prairie vole, no disrespect to that beautiful work,</p>
<p>but to humans and say, oh, vasopressin inhalers</p>
<p>are going to make you monogamous or something.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s, I probably got the direction</p>
<p>of the effect wrong, but you get the point.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, no, I think you&rsquo;re absolutely right.</p>
<p>And I think it will happen.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s starting to happen and it will happen</p>
<p>because getting at the neuroscience</p>
<p>is getting at the underlying mechanisms</p>
<p>that are driving the process.</p>
<p>So, you know, what an evolutionary perspective</p>
<p>brings to bear is evolved function and ultimate explanation,</p>
<p>the selective forces that created adaptations,</p>
<p>the functions of those adaptations,</p>
<p>and the neuroscience brings,</p>
<p>well, what is the underlying machinery</p>
<p>that these mechanisms are instantiated in?</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;d be wonderful to collaborate someday.</p>
<p>Maybe we&rsquo;ll do a brain imaging study on jealousy</p>
<p>or something in, I don&rsquo;t know, throw it,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re the psychologist,</p>
<p>you would come up with the beautiful experimental design.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m certain that people are going to want to learn more</p>
<p>about your work.</p>
<p>Certainly we will give them links to your social media</p>
<p>and other sites.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve written a tremendous number</p>
<p>of really interesting books.</p>
<p>Tell us about your most recent book</p>
<p>and maybe some of the others</p>
<p>that if people are interested in these topics</p>
<p>and they want to learn more that they could explore.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Okay, so, well, my most recent book</p>
<p>is called When Men Behave Badly,</p>
<p>The Hidden Roots of Sexual Deception,</p>
<p>Harassment, and Assault.</p>
<p>And that book deals with conflict between the sexes,</p>
<p>sexual conflict.</p>
<p>And so it deals with them both in what I call</p>
<p>mating market conflicts,</p>
<p>some of the topics we&rsquo;ve been talking about,</p>
<p>deception in internet dating and things like that.</p>
<p>Second is conflict that occurs within mating relationships</p>
<p>of the sort that we&rsquo;ve been talking about as well.</p>
<p>Financial infidelity, emotional infidelity,</p>
<p>sexual infidelity, coping with conflict</p>
<p>within a relationship.</p>
<p>And I actually have some suggestions for strategies</p>
<p>for coping with conflict within a relationship.</p>
<p>Coping in the after,</p>
<p>dealing with the aftermath of breakups.</p>
<p>So often there&rsquo;s an asymmetry.</p>
<p>One person wants to break up, the other doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>So I talk about coping in the aftermath</p>
<p>and then I also talk in this book,</p>
<p>When Men Behave Badly,</p>
<p>about some of the darker sides of human mating,</p>
<p>like intimate partner violence, stalking,</p>
<p>sexual harassment, sexual coercion.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what that book&rsquo;s about.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s gotten well-reviewed</p>
<p>and people find it very useful in understanding</p>
<p>what is otherwise a lot of baffling phenomena.</p>
<p>Why do men and women seem at odds with each other</p>
<p>in so many domains?</p>
<p>Why do some of these recurrent forms</p>
<p>of sexual conflict occur?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what that book&rsquo;s about.</p>
<p>My previous book, so my first book,</p>
<p>which I&rsquo;ve had the good fortune</p>
<p>to be able to revise a couple times,</p>
<p>deals more broadly with human mating strategies.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called The Evolution of Desire,</p>
<p>Strategies of Human Mating,</p>
<p>and gives people a broad overview</p>
<p>of what people want in a mate,</p>
<p>tactics of attraction, tactics of mate retention,</p>
<p>and so forth throughout the whole mating process,</p>
<p>serial mating, causes of divorce, and so forth.</p>
<p>And then even more broadly,</p>
<p>I have a textbook called Evolutionary Psychology,</p>
<p>The New Science of the Mind,</p>
<p>which is in its sixth edition right now.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s the most widely used textbook</p>
<p>in evolutionary psychology around North America and Europe.</p>
<p>And actually it&rsquo;s been translated</p>
<p>even into Arabic and other countries.</p>
<p>So that deals somewhat with mating,</p>
<p>but also deals with survival problems,</p>
<p>or evolved fears and phobias,</p>
<p>issues about kin and family, extended family,</p>
<p>friendships, social hierarchies, status hierarchies,</p>
<p>warfare, and other topics.</p>
<p>So the Evolutionary Psychology textbook</p>
<p>is the broadest book.</p>
<p>And then maybe the second broadest</p>
<p>is The Evolution of Desire,</p>
<p>Strategies of Human Mating.</p>
<p>And then for those interested in conflict between the sexes,</p>
<p>the latest book, When Men Behave Badly.</p>
<p>Fantastic.</p>
<p>I love your work.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so grateful for the clarity and depth and rigor</p>
<p>with which you do it and you convey it to us.</p>
<p>I know I speak for many people</p>
<p>when I just want to say thank you.</p>
<p>This is a tremendously informative conversation.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s been a delight to talk with you,</p>
<p>and I hope we do engage in that research collaboration</p>
<p>of merging neuroscience and evolutionary psychology.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s do it.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Great. Thank you, David.</p>
