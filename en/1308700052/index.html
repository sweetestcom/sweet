    <p>Our card this week is Jermaine Johnson, the Two of Spades from Arizona.</p>
<p>In 2006, Central Phoenix was shaken after a beloved member of the community was killed</p>
<p>while he was minding his own business, hanging out with his friends.</p>
<p>For 16 years, Phoenix police have attempted to hunt down the killers, only to hit dead</p>
<p>ends at every turn.</p>
<p>But they have far from given up hope because they know there are people in the community</p>
<p>who hold the answers to the questions that have haunted the city since 2006.</p>
<p>Who killed Jermaine, and why?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Ashley Flowers, and this is The Deck.</p>
<p>It was around 11.45 p.m. on October 20, 2006, and Detective Barry Giesemann with the Phoenix</p>
<p>Police Department was at home kicking off the weekend when he got a call that there</p>
<p>had been a homicide in Central Phoenix, and he needed to respond to the scene right away.</p>
<p>When he got there, the scene was already bustling with activity.</p>
<p>Patrol cars were lining the streets, and officers had roped off an alley that was sandwiched</p>
<p>between some office-type businesses and a house.</p>
<p>And although Detective Giesemann hadn&rsquo;t been briefed on the situation yet, he was</p>
<p>probably hopeful that this would be an open and shut case.</p>
<p>I mean, it was a Friday night, and there were plenty of buildings nearby ripe with possible</p>
<p>witnesses, or at the very least, surely there was some surveillance footage around for them</p>
<p>to work with.</p>
<p>When Detective Giesemann was given the full lowdown, he learned that just before 9 p.m.,</p>
<p>dispatch had received several 911 calls about lots of gunshots and a man down.</p>
<p>Officers arrived moments later to find a young man lying in the middle of that alley.</p>
<p>His ID indicated that he was 27-year-old Jermaine Johnson.</p>
<p>It was clear he&rsquo;d been shot multiple times, but was still somehow clinging to life.</p>
<p>But shortly after being rushed to the hospital, he passed away.</p>
<p>On scene still were two young men who said that they were both with Jermaine when he</p>
<p>was shot.</p>
<p>One was Jermaine&rsquo;s 22-year-old cousin, Milo, and the other was their 17-year-old friend,</p>
<p>Kyle.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve changed both of their names for this episode.</p>
<p>Through speaking with Milo and Kyle, police were able to piece together a timeline of</p>
<p>what led up to the shooting.</p>
<p>That evening, Jermaine, Milo, and Kyle went to the nearby cork and bottle liquor store</p>
<p>to get some cigars, and as they&rsquo;re walking in, they saw this group of men standing around</p>
<p>outside of the store.</p>
<p>Jermaine and Milo recognized two of them because exactly a week prior, they had actually gotten</p>
<p>into a fight with those guys.</p>
<p>During that altercation, Milo said that he and Jermaine were sitting in the parking lot</p>
<p>of Arrowwood Apartments about a block away from where Jermaine was eventually killed.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s when a group of people walked up to their car.</p>
<p>One of the guys asked Jermaine, quote, what&rsquo;s the A like?</p>
<p>He means like the letter A.</p>
<p>Milo said that he and Jermaine didn&rsquo;t know what exactly that meant, so Jermaine repeated</p>
<p>the guy&rsquo;s question back to him, like, what&rsquo;s the A like?</p>
<p>Now, it is worth noting that A is slang for acid or LSD, so it&rsquo;s possible that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>these guys were talking about, but there are also far more innocent explanations, like</p>
<p>Milo thought maybe he meant A for Arizona.</p>
<p>Anyways, Milo said that the guy went on hassling Jermaine, but eventually a woman who was with</p>
<p>the group of guys separated them.</p>
<p>Now at some point during the incident, guns were drawn.</p>
<p>No one was shot, but Jermaine&rsquo;s car did get grazed by a bullet.</p>
<p>Milo and Jermaine didn&rsquo;t see those guys again until this day, standing outside the</p>
<p>liquor store with some other people.</p>
<p>So Jermaine, Milo, and Kyle bought what they wanted at the liquor store, and then when</p>
<p>they walked back outside, this group of guys had already left.</p>
<p>Jermaine and Milo and Kyle carried on their merry way, but they didn&rsquo;t get very far, because</p>
<p>as the three of them cut through an alley that went behind the business right next to</p>
<p>the liquor store, that&rsquo;s where they were confronted by those same two guys from the group, and</p>
<p>they both looked like they were ready to fight.</p>
<p>Here is Detective Michelle Cervantes.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s working the case today.</p>
<p>According to the people that were with Jermaine, there were words exchanged, like, hey, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>all good, let&rsquo;s talk it out, and everybody thought things were good.</p>
<p>But things weren&rsquo;t good.</p>
<p>The guy who&rsquo;d gotten into a shouting match with Jermaine last week walked up to Jermaine</p>
<p>while reaching into his waistband to grab a gun.</p>
<p>Milo and Kyle said that Jermaine stopped the guy before he pulled out the gun and said</p>
<p>something along the lines of, there&rsquo;s no need to shoot it out, we&rsquo;re both men, we can box.</p>
<p>To which the man replied, let&rsquo;s fight.</p>
<p>The guy took a few steps back and said, weapons down, while pulling out his gun, which looked</p>
<p>like a semi-automatic pistol.</p>
<p>Milo said that he acted like he was going to put the gun down, but as he was setting</p>
<p>it down, he was acting weird, like he kept looking around and scanning the area.</p>
<p>Suddenly, in the blink of an eye, the guy pointed his pistol at Jermaine and fired four</p>
<p>or five shots.</p>
<p>In a complete panic, Milo and Kyle rushed to find cover.</p>
<p>They heard more gunfire from what sounded like a different gun and then saw two guys</p>
<p>running away.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when they noticed Jermaine laying in the middle of the alley in a pool of blood.</p>
<p>Milo ran all the way home, instructed his mother to call the police, and then ran back</p>
<p>to the scene to be with his cousin.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s when police arrived.</p>
<p>Milo and Kyle didn&rsquo;t really know the guys, but they thought that their nicknames were</p>
<p>Maniac and Xavier.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s not clear to me how they knew their nicknames.</p>
<p>Maybe Jermaine called them those names before they shot him.</p>
<p>Perhaps they were calling each other those names.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>And police reports aren&rsquo;t clear about it.</p>
<p>Whatever the case, Milo and Kyle were also able to provide a description for police.</p>
<p>They were black males, 18 to 20 to 25 years old.</p>
<p>Both were approximately five foot nine.</p>
<p>Both were approximately 155 pounds.</p>
<p>Xavier was described as being a dark-skinned male with short hair.</p>
<p>Maniac was described to have short hair.</p>
<p>One of the guys, either Milo or Kyle, pointed out to investigators that Jermaine&rsquo;s car</p>
<p>was nearby.</p>
<p>It was actually parked right over at the Fountain Oaks apartment complex, which was right beside</p>
<p>the alley.</p>
<p>Officers went to examine it and they found a dent in the car&rsquo;s trunk that looked like</p>
<p>it was from a bullet, which supported Milo&rsquo;s statement that Jermaine was involved in an</p>
<p>argument the previous Friday that involved a shooting.</p>
<p>So police knew that they needed to process the car along with the scene where Jermaine</p>
<p>was shot.</p>
<p>So at the scene, we had some blood.</p>
<p>We had some other items.</p>
<p>We had some beer cans and some other cans of another liquid.</p>
<p>And then obviously we had the casings that we collected.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t even know if those cans were even involved, but they were nearby.</p>
<p>So, you know, you have one shot at processing a crime scene.</p>
<p>So if you think it&rsquo;s possibly related, you want to collect it.</p>
<p>And it may not even, later on, we determined that it wasn&rsquo;t even related at all.</p>
<p>But because it was nearby, we did collect it and we did process it.</p>
<p>Casings and beer cans weren&rsquo;t the only things investigators found, though.</p>
<p>They also discovered a piece of paper with a phone number scribbled on it, along with</p>
<p>the name Sharonda.</p>
<p>The paper was near where Jermaine had fallen, so police thought maybe it had slipped out</p>
<p>of his pocket.</p>
<p>And naturally, they wanted to talk with Sharonda.</p>
<p>Once morning rolled around, Detective Giesemann called the number on the piece of paper.</p>
<p>And on the other end was a woman named Sharonda who identified herself as Jermaine&rsquo;s sister.</p>
<p>She had already been notified of his death and talked to police, so she didn&rsquo;t have anything</p>
<p>else super helpful to add.</p>
<p>Now, she was at the hospital when Jermaine was taken there, along with some of his family.</p>
<p>But one person who hadn&rsquo;t been at the hospital was Jermaine&rsquo;s mom, Veronica.</p>
<p>So Detective Giesemann asked about her.</p>
<p>Sharonda said that she was all the way in Alabama visiting family, but she&rsquo;d already</p>
<p>been informed of what had happened and she was trying to fly back to Phoenix that day.</p>
<p>Authorities had plenty to do in the meantime.</p>
<p>Specifically, Detective Giesemann wanted to get back to his initial hunch.</p>
<p>Surely someone around the crime scene saw something.</p>
<p>So they started knocking on doors.</p>
<p>But that wasn&rsquo;t as fruitful as he&rsquo;d hoped.</p>
<p>A few people said like, yeah, we heard gunshots last night, but that was about it.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the area that it was in, I mean, this happened in an alley at nighttime.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s unknown how many people were outside their apartments at the time.</p>
<p>You know, most likely it was dark because it is in an alley.</p>
<p>Alleys are not usually lit up, especially in this area.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s a lot of people in that area that will not speak to police, unfortunately.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a big hurdle right there.</p>
<p>These individuals that were involved most likely are only known on the street by nickname.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s very hard to track them down.</p>
<p>There is quite a bit of crime that occurs in that area.</p>
<p>There are at least two large apartment complexes in that area where drugs are common in that</p>
<p>area, as well as gang-related activities.</p>
<p>Whether people weren&rsquo;t talking because they were scared or because they truly didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>see anything, police didn&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>But either way, they weren&rsquo;t getting the information that they needed to solve the case.</p>
<p>So investigators turned to nearby businesses to see if they had any surveillance footage.</p>
<p>But none of them did, not a single one.</p>
<p>So after striking out on their hunt for video, investigators checked to see if the Cork &amp; Bottle</p>
<p>liquor store kept records of people&rsquo;s IDs who buy alcohol or cigarettes there, hoping</p>
<p>maybe the two suspects bought something before shooting Jermaine.</p>
<p>But the store manager said that they didn&rsquo;t keep any kind of records like that.</p>
<p>So next investigators went to the nearby apartment complex, Fountain Oaks, and they asked the</p>
<p>office manager if she knew anyone by the nicknames Maniac or Xavier, but she didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>At this point, I would say detectives were back to square one, but they had been stuck</p>
<p>there, already kind of grasping at straws.</p>
<p>Even after Jermaine&rsquo;s mom, Veronica, got to town, she couldn&rsquo;t add much.</p>
<p>She and a bunch of other family members gathered to talk to police, and they all said that</p>
<p>they weren&rsquo;t aware of any enemies Jermaine had.</p>
<p>And they said that he hadn&rsquo;t talked to them about any trouble recently either.</p>
<p>So it seemed to detectives that the only person who knew the most and was willing to be honest</p>
<p>with them was Jermaine&rsquo;s on-again, off-again girlfriend, Julia.</p>
<p>But we know there was at least something, right?</p>
<p>Milo and Kyle talked about that altercation a week before, and that story was backed up</p>
<p>by Julia.</p>
<p>She said pretty much the same thing, that he had gotten shot at about a week before.</p>
<p>And they kept going back to Julia every once in a while just to see if there was anything</p>
<p>else.</p>
<p>And from reading the police reports, it seems like it wasn&rsquo;t until the days following the</p>
<p>murder that Julia told investigators the shooting she told them about before, where Jermaine</p>
<p>had gotten shot at, was more like a shootout.</p>
<p>Like Jermaine had told her he returned fire, which was new information.</p>
<p>So investigators decided to put together a photo lineup of two individuals that they</p>
<p>thought could possibly have been involved in that shootout, because they were known</p>
<p>to go by the street names Xavier and Maniac.</p>
<p>Now they intermixed those with photos of other men, and they showed the photo lineups to</p>
<p>Milo asking him to point out which, if any, of the guys were present at that shooting.</p>
<p>Police would also go over the photos with Kyle, but neither of those lineups provided</p>
<p>the results that police were hoping for.</p>
<p>It could be that these witnesses, when they initially gave the names that they did give</p>
<p>to us, when it actually came around to picking these individuals out of a photo lineup, they</p>
<p>may have gotten scared.</p>
<p>But since they didn&rsquo;t pick these two individuals out, we basically have to go back to the drawing</p>
<p>board and hope that there&rsquo;s going to be other people to come forward to tell us about it,</p>
<p>or we get some positive results from the items that we submitted to our crime lab for analysis.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t long until they did get results back from the crime lab.</p>
<p>Everything from the scene had been sent off, and one of the things there got a hit.</p>
<p>But Detective Cervantes didn&rsquo;t want to elaborate on which of the items that was, like if it</p>
<p>was one of the beer cans or something else at the scene.</p>
<p>We did get a DNA hit on something that ended up not being probative to the investigation.</p>
<p>When you go into a crime scene, you only have one shot, so you collect what you think may</p>
<p>be probative.</p>
<p>In this case, the item that we got the DNA hit on was not probative.</p>
<p>She also didn&rsquo;t elaborate on what she meant by not probative.</p>
<p>Like were they able to get a full DNA profile from the item, match it to someone in CODIS</p>
<p>and then rule them out through an alibi or something?</p>
<p>Or did the testing only produce a partial profile that didn&rsquo;t meet the criteria to</p>
<p>be uploaded to any databases?</p>
<p>Or were they able to track it to someone but it became clear that they didn&rsquo;t have anything</p>
<p>to do with the crime, so that was likely discarded trash from before the crime even happened</p>
<p>rather than actual evidence in the crime?</p>
<p>There are so many different things that not probative can mean when you&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>But unfortunately, we don&rsquo;t have those answers.</p>
<p>Whatever the case, while the DNA hit got their hopes up, it ultimately ended up being another</p>
<p>dead end for investigators.</p>
<p>As the days and weeks dragged by, detectives caught wind of some rumors going around town</p>
<p>that at least sort of answered one of the questions looming over the case.</p>
<p>Why were these two guys so mad at Jermaine?</p>
<p>It was rumored to be over a girl or possibly money owed to somebody.</p>
<p>Having a hunch about motive does next to nothing when you don&rsquo;t have any suspects.</p>
<p>And by the time November rolled around, police were getting tired of waiting for the assailants</p>
<p>to come forward on their own.</p>
<p>So they began handing out flyers directing people to Silent Witness, which is an organization</p>
<p>that lets people submit tips anonymously, basically Phoenix&rsquo;s version of Crimestoppers.</p>
<p>They passed out flyers at the cork and bottle liquor store, several apartments near the</p>
<p>murder scene, anywhere they could think of that was possibly connected to Jermaine&rsquo;s</p>
<p>murder.</p>
<p>Despite their efforts, as the months passed, Jermaine&rsquo;s case went ice cold.</p>
<p>But his family didn&rsquo;t give up hope, especially his mom Veronica.</p>
<p>Even as years went by, Veronica kept diligently calling and meeting with detectives to see</p>
<p>if there were any updates in her son&rsquo;s case.</p>
<p>The passage of time did nothing to sway how desperately she wanted her son&rsquo;s killer</p>
<p>behind bars.</p>
<p>She missed her talented, loving son more than anything.</p>
<p>He was remembered as a hard worker at his job, as a customer service representative</p>
<p>at a local call center.</p>
<p>But when he wasn&rsquo;t working his regular hours or taking on overtime, he loved playing sports</p>
<p>and writing songs and recording music with his cousin.</p>
<p>Part of Jermaine&rsquo;s obituary in the Arizona Republic read, quote,</p>
<p>With his unique personality, he would always embrace you with a hug and a friendly smile.</p>
<p>End quote.</p>
<p>Those hugs and that smile were things Veronica knew she&rsquo;d never get to experience again,</p>
<p>because a pair of cowards decided to snuff out his bright light.</p>
<p>In 2014, Veronica told azcentral.com that she felt tracking down her son&rsquo;s killers</p>
<p>was a final act of love.</p>
<p>She said, quote,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll go to the end.</p>
<p>I just want to see those people come to justice.</p>
<p>It won&rsquo;t bring Jermaine back, but the unknowing just kills you.</p>
<p>End quote.</p>
<p>Veronica said that her son had the biggest heart, and she knew he&rsquo;d be proud of her</p>
<p>for pushing for justice.</p>
<p>In 2016, for the 10-year anniversary of Jermaine&rsquo;s death, the family held a press conference</p>
<p>that was covered on local news station ABC 15.</p>
<p>Veronica made a public plea for any witnesses to come forward.</p>
<p>I just pray that God touches the person&rsquo;s heart that&rsquo;s seen this, so that they can</p>
<p>come forth and tell us what happened.</p>
<p>We need some closure in our family.</p>
<p>Despite the plea, the case would remain stagnant for another three years, until 2019, when</p>
<p>investigators got their first big, tangible tip.</p>
<p>In March of that year, investigators got a call that an inmate named Robert at a local</p>
<p>jail had information about a murder.</p>
<p>He knew who did the killing and where the weapon was buried.</p>
<p>Investigators weren&rsquo;t sure what specific homicide he was even talking about, but they</p>
<p>were open to new leads on any of their cold cases.</p>
<p>So Detective Cervantes went to talk to Robert, and he had quite the story to tell.</p>
<p>He said that a while back, he was talking to this longtime friend of his who we&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>call Edward, and their conversation turned to the topic of guns.</p>
<p>Robert recalled that his buddy Edward used to have a certain kind of gun and that he</p>
<p>hadn&rsquo;t seen him with it in a while.</p>
<p>So he asked what had happened to it.</p>
<p>And Edward said that he had buried the gun with demons in it, which Robert understood</p>
<p>to mean Edward had killed someone with it.</p>
<p>Edward told Robert that he had wrapped the gun in plastic and buried it in the ground.</p>
<p>Edward even drew a map for him and showed him where it was buried, which was near the</p>
<p>intersection of 40th Street and McDowell Road, a block away from where Jermaine was gunned</p>
<p>down in 2006.</p>
<p>But that wasn&rsquo;t the only thing leading detectives to believe Robert was talking about Jermaine&rsquo;s</p>
<p>murder.</p>
<p>There was something else that he mentioned that made their ears perk up.</p>
<p>Robert said Edward had a friend who grew up in California, and apparently Edward and his</p>
<p>friend had been in a shootout a few years back over a dispute about a woman at the Arrowwood</p>
<p>apartment complex.</p>
<p>Now that&rsquo;s the exact complex where Jermaine and his cousin Milo had been in a shootout</p>
<p>a week before Jermaine was killed.</p>
<p>Detective Cervantes showed Robert a Google map of the area that he mentioned to see if</p>
<p>he could pinpoint the exact location where he said the gun was buried, and he did.</p>
<p>He said it was in front of an apartment complex, in a green irrigation or utility box, which</p>
<p>are totally different things, but really what mattered to investigators was the location.</p>
<p>This felt so promising, so Detective Cervantes wasted no time.</p>
<p>She got a search warrant for the green box Robert mentioned, but there was no gun in</p>
<p>or around the box.</p>
<p>And that dead-end tip is the last big lead investigators received in Jermaine&rsquo;s now</p>
<p>16-year-old case.</p>
<p>In some ways, detectives feel like they&rsquo;re no closer to solving it than they were in</p>
<p>2006.</p>
<p>And not knowing who these individuals are, we don&rsquo;t know if they&rsquo;re gang members, which</p>
<p>if somebody has information, and these two, if they were, I don&rsquo;t know because we don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know who they are, but if they were gang members, you&rsquo;re not going to have a person snitch on</p>
<p>a gang member.</p>
<p>It just, it doesn&rsquo;t happen because there&rsquo;s going to possibly be retaliation.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if this was gang-related because we have no information on that, and, you know,</p>
<p>we have parts of our city that just will not give information to the police in fear of</p>
<p>retaliation or in fear of being labeled as a snitch.</p>
<p>Even with the frustrating lulls and roadblocks in the investigation, detectives haven&rsquo;t given up.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s still a victim of homicide.</p>
<p>Nobody&rsquo;s life should be taken in this way.</p>
<p>Jermaine was just walking down the alley with a couple of people.</p>
<p>There was nothing that provoked it at that time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty cold-hearted to what these individuals did by just coming up to him, and were they</p>
<p>the ones that were involved in the first incident a week prior?</p>
<p>Very possibly that they were.</p>
<p>Well, let it go.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not worth taking someone&rsquo;s life over.</p>
<p>You know, Jermaine had family, you know, loved, and he&rsquo;s missed.</p>
<p>And I believe that&rsquo;s why I went into homicide, is because all these people deserve some sort</p>
<p>of closure or justice.</p>
<p>And if he was involved in any illegal activity, it doesn&rsquo;t make him any less of a victim.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s still someone&rsquo;s son, brother.</p>
<p>People knowing what happened and not coming forward to tell us.</p>
<p>Us detectives speak for these victims now because they don&rsquo;t have a voice.</p>
<p>And I think the families deserve to know and to have justice and have closure and hold</p>
<p>the persons responsible for who did this.</p>
<p>Jermaine&rsquo;s family has waited 16 long years to see his killer brought to justice.</p>
<p>They deserve answers and closure.</p>
<p>And whoever the monsters are that did this to Jermaine, they deserve to be held responsible.</p>
<p>So please, if you have any information at all about the murder of Jermaine Johnson in</p>
<p>2006, reach out to the Phoenix Police Department at 602-262-6151.</p>
