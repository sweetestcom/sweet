you</p><p>get cured don&rsquo;t mention our names just</p><p>check with your doctor before</p><p>implementing any of the information</p><p>we&rsquo;re going to share</p><p>okay all right Steve all right that&rsquo;s</p><p>terrific let&rsquo;s see here why don&rsquo;t we uh</p><p>start off uh let&rsquo;s see shamali can you</p><p>hear me dear it looks like your camera</p><p>froze she&rsquo;s got set up on the schedule</p><p>shamali I think her camera froze if she</p><p>pops back up we&rsquo;ll ring right on in the</p><p>meantime let&rsquo;s do something just uh</p><p>throw caution to win and start off with</p><p>a quiz question this weekend Dr Burke</p><p>here&rsquo;s the first one</p><p>all right so why does sugar</p><p>cause fluid retention in your lower legs</p><p>and your feet gross that&rsquo;s the first</p><p>question that&rsquo;s awful okay let&rsquo;s uh</p><p>let&rsquo;s then slide over to social media uh</p><p>Emma from YouTube could you please give</p><p>us some guidance on how to destroy</p><p>cancer cells without using chemo</p><p>yeah</p><p>um the the cancer cells uh they they</p><p>have this interesting survival mechanism</p><p>they they kind of avoid</p><p>uh committing suicide like regular cells</p><p>die they have a kind of a time limit but</p><p>can&rsquo;t cancer cells live forever so you</p><p>want to create an environment that um</p><p>makes it very hard for them to live</p><p>um when you do fasting</p><p>you just turn up the dial on your immune</p><p>system by very very large amount and so</p><p>like the</p><p>tumor suppressor genes and all these</p><p>things that can actually fight things</p><p>fight cancer off go go up and so this is</p><p>why fasting is the most important thing</p><p>for cancer okay and there&rsquo;s another</p><p>protocol that we recommend you can look</p><p>at my videos it&rsquo;s in one of the links</p><p>um in some of the videos that I&rsquo;ve done</p><p>uh that based on some research there&rsquo;s a</p><p>protocol that we recommend but also the</p><p>foods that can create</p><p>um a great effect on</p><p>wiping out cancer would be like the</p><p>cruciferous</p><p>some of these um</p><p>garlic things like that that have a</p><p>really a negative effect for that cancer</p><p>cell it can&rsquo;t survive</p><p>but those are a couple tips there&rsquo;s a</p><p>lot more data on this</p><p>that I want to share with you but um</p><p>that would be the quick answer</p><p>all right very good Echo we&rsquo;ve got some</p><p>Intel from the field as they call it</p><p>this gentleman whose parents rudely</p><p>named him spam Mouse how dare they from</p><p>YouTube uh says enjoy that extra cake</p><p>today birthday boy so he&rsquo;s suggesting</p><p>that perhaps even you have some</p><p>weaknesses and may succumb to the cake</p><p>urge which because it&rsquo;s your birthday so</p><p>happy birthday Dr Burke does he have</p><p>that right</p><p>well thank you and it&rsquo;s I just really um</p><p>I hate going through these darn 40s</p><p>because I&rsquo;m 48 and 47 was bad enough but</p><ol start=48><li>that&rsquo;s old I know just how you I</li></ol><p>don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s going on I mean like I</p><p>don&rsquo;t understand this like when you get</p><p>older you&rsquo;re why is that your eyebrows</p><p>grow an accelerated rate you got to cut</p><p>them like on a daily basis you have</p><p>nose hairs coming out you know well they</p><p>shouldn&rsquo;t be I mean it&rsquo;s really rough</p><p>it&rsquo;s really rough don&rsquo;t neglect the ears</p><p>happens there too</p><p>at this rate my earlob&rsquo;s going to be</p><p>down to my my uh my traps well nothing</p><p>like a cute braid to take care of that</p><p>anyway so happy birthday from everyone</p><p>Dr Berg that&rsquo;s wonderful now let&rsquo;s go</p><p>okay then we&rsquo;ve got clapping going on</p><p>from June in The Green Room Samir from</p><p>YouTube please guide me to recovery</p><p>after a stroke I have no left hand</p><p>function anymore I have minimal left leg</p><p>function and my blood pressure is high</p><p>help with exclamation marks he puts hope</p><p>we can Samir</p><p>there is some great research on doing</p><p>the methylene blue uh that that can help</p><p>increase oxygen and the cells uh so that</p><p>would be one remedy I think two dropper</p><p>fulls of that</p><p>um pharmaceutical grade methylene blue</p><p>in some water in the morning maybe with</p><p>electrolyte powder because it doesn&rsquo;t</p><p>taste that great</p><p>um could actually get more oxygen to the</p><p>brain now there&rsquo;s other things too like</p><p>tocatrinals that would be good</p><p>um niacin is also good to help</p><p>um recover after a stroke but then of</p><p>course the basic stuff is fasting low</p><p>carb I mean you need to be on that like</p><p>right right away to help improve the</p><p>brain</p><p>repair and function the worst thing you</p><p>could do is eat birthday cake that would</p><p>be the absolute worst worst thing you</p><p>could do I was looking to see if you had</p><p>any crumbs around your mouth but you you</p><p>passed the test doesn&rsquo;t look like you uh</p><p>yeah succumbed to that Temptation I</p><p>don&rsquo;t I moved beyond the birthday cakes</p><p>all right very good uh this is</p><p>um not good news Emily from Facebook I</p><p>have stage 3B ovarian cancer and stage</p><p>four melanoma what can I do to address</p><p>these conditions Emily sorry that that&rsquo;s</p><p>what you&rsquo;re going through</p><p>you know uh unfortunately</p><p>[Music]</p><p>um</p><p>I&rsquo;m not telling you not to do this but</p><p>the the</p><p>medical care just doesn&rsquo;t have good</p><p>statistics on this so there is a lot of</p><p>alternative things that people do people</p><p>do combinations of medical and</p><p>alternative but I would watch all the</p><p>videos that I have and look at the</p><p>research and then make your own</p><p>decisions but there&rsquo;s some great</p><p>protocols that you can take</p><p>um but like I said before</p><p>there&rsquo;s one very very powerful thing</p><p>that is keeping quite a few people alive</p><p>even with the most worst case scenario</p><p>stage four cancer and that would be the</p><p>prolonged fasting</p><p>prolonged fasting has the most powerful</p><p>effect for a survival rate but there&rsquo;s</p><p>other things that need to be done too</p><p>the only problem with that is how much</p><p>fat do you have extra in your body that</p><p>you can use to fasten a long period and</p><p>I&rsquo;m talking about you know even weeks of</p><p>fasting and then taking nutrition but</p><p>that that&rsquo;s the area that I would look</p><p>into if I had cancer I would be doing a</p><p>lot more of that and um take a look and</p><p>watch all these videos because I we we</p><p>have a lot of great information on that</p><p>topic</p><p>okay Emily we&rsquo;re all pulling for you I</p><p>hope that um you know um</p><p>we can find some progress in that awful</p><p>condition that you&rsquo;re suffering from uh</p><p>let&rsquo;s see the audience has given a quick</p><p>answer to the questions that they</p><p>usually do our first one asks why does</p><p>sugar cause fluid retention in your</p><p>lower legs and feet and a 70 percent of</p><p>our respondents say that it&rsquo;s a lack of</p><p>potassium 20 say sugar affects adrenals</p><p>and the final 10 percent say that</p><p>retained water gives way to gravity so</p><p>they&rsquo;re suggestion I guess that you&rsquo;re</p><p>going to retain water but it goes plop</p><p>to your feet</p><p>it&rsquo;s a double double-edged sword because</p><p>you have the sugar and then you have the</p><p>insulin Spike insulin tends to retain</p><p>sodium</p><p>that&rsquo;s one thing but then the sugar</p><p>um has to go somewhere so a good amount</p><p>of it gets stored as uh stored sugar</p><p>that&rsquo;s called glycogen and when it gets</p><p>stored</p><p>um it gets stored with a lot of water so</p><p>for every molecule of glucose you store</p><p>three molecules of water so you can</p><p>imagine</p><p>um you&rsquo;re holding this fluid-filled</p><p>sponge probably between</p><p>I don&rsquo;t know 13 to 20 pounds of fluid in</p><p>your body that you&rsquo;re just carrying</p><p>around unnecessarily and then also it</p><p>locks up a lot of the potassium too</p><p>because in order to store that glycogen</p><p>you have to use potassium so now we have</p><p>a potassium that&rsquo;s stored and so this is</p><p>why when you eat refined carbs and sugar</p><p>refined sugars it tends to lock up a lot</p><p>of the potassium and then you have the</p><p>symptoms of a potassium deficiency just</p><p>like</p><p>when before I got married my wife and I</p><p>went to this Italian restaurant and we</p><p>had pizza and pasta and wine and</p><p>desserts and uh you could say it&rsquo;s a</p><p>mass amount of carbs refined carbs</p><p>so I&rsquo;m we&rsquo;re about ready to leave and we</p><p>look around and everyone&rsquo;s gone and</p><p>we&rsquo;re the last ones and the guy with the</p><p>dessert table is going he&rsquo;s going next</p><p>to us he goes you want do you want any</p><p>of these desserts before we shoot them</p><p>out and of course I don&rsquo;t like to waste</p><p>food so after consuming</p><p>massive amounts of additional refined</p><p>carbohydrates I remember trying to sleep</p><p>that night and my I was hearing these</p><p>pounding in my ears pounding my heart</p><p>rate was pounding that was a classic</p><p>potassium deficiency little did I know I</p><p>could have just ate some potassium foods</p><p>and and countered that but didn&rsquo;t sleep</p><p>the whole night so</p><p>that is a long answer to that short</p><p>question well you know doctor a quick</p><p>anecdote from me I&rsquo;ve been a sauna freak</p><p>at the gym recently tons of saunting and</p><p>exercise Sonic exercise and I started</p><p>having AFib and I think what I realized</p><p>instead of looking to you is I wasn&rsquo;t</p><p>drinking enough and I think I was</p><p>depleted and stuff so I started uh with</p><p>your electrolyte formula again and I</p><p>don&rsquo;t know if that could have cured it</p><p>but I think I was dehydrated and maybe</p><p>that was low and could that cause a</p><p>A-fib if you have a lack of potassium or</p><p>well it when you lose sweat you do lose</p><p>some sodium as well potassium as well</p><p>and magnesium mostly sodium but just</p><p>just the fact that you&rsquo;re losing</p><p>electrolytes in general probably made it</p><p>worse so if especially if you&rsquo;re going</p><p>into it with um pre-existing</p><p>deficiencies so</p><p>actually Lori says I have tons of</p><p>pre-existing deficiencies but that&rsquo;s for</p><p>another show</p><p>I&rsquo;m talking about other things Steve</p><p>that&rsquo;s right all right let&rsquo;s see uh so</p><p>we finished with the quiz now here&rsquo;s</p><p>Helena from Facebook what supplements</p><p>should I take to address chronic</p><p>constipation sounds like that meal you</p><p>had with the</p><p>with your wife years ago may have done</p><p>that we may have taken care of that now</p><p>that&rsquo;s we are going to</p><p>um talk about that uh as one of the</p><p>questions so just stay tuned and listen</p><p>because we will answer that question</p><p>extensively all right Helena that is for</p><p>you so stand by for that let&rsquo;s see uh</p><p>Ray from YouTube lab work shows protein</p><p>from the kidneys what can I do to stop</p><p>this I&rsquo;m a diabetic with high blood</p><p>pressure</p><p>well diabetes is a a condition where you</p><p>have too much sugar that&rsquo;s going through</p><p>the kidneys and it&rsquo;s in the blood so</p><p>you&rsquo;re filtering that all that Sugar</p><p>destroys the the nephron the filter and</p><p>um now the the protein is going right</p><p>through there which now that can create</p><p>edema swelling and all sorts of things</p><p>so you know</p><p>the most important thing you need to do</p><p>any diabetic should do is to</p><p>first of all realize that diabetes is</p><p>too much sugar and get the sugar out of</p><p>the diet stop eating sugar and refined</p><p>carbs go on a low carb diet that is this</p><p>the big solution</p><p>um and then hopefully your kidneys will</p><p>heal up but</p><p>um you know when you&rsquo;re taking</p><p>medication that&rsquo;s designed to lower</p><p>um blood glucose and manage your blood</p><p>sugars you better correct the cause of</p><p>it too at the same time which is your</p><p>diet and then what will happen is you&rsquo;re</p><p>if you&rsquo;re still taking medications</p><p>you&rsquo;ll end up with low blood sugar so</p><p>you never want to take those medications</p><p>with low blood sugar because this is</p><p>going to push it down lower</p><p>so get with your doctor have them make</p><p>adjustments to the point where you can</p><p>actually not have to take that anymore</p><p>um but that would be the ultimate</p><p>solution okay in the doctor Berg this is</p><p>hilarious question and here it is</p><p>all right what is healthier to eat</p><p>the cereal from Kellogg&rsquo;s Corn Pops or</p><p>the box it came in</p><p>well that&rsquo;s going to be interesting I&rsquo;m</p><p>I suspect an odd answer and let&rsquo;s</p><p>quickly go over to all the people that</p><p>are answering and listening to your</p><p>questions and wishing you Happy Birthday</p><p>and so on and they are as from as</p><p>follows and we&rsquo;d like to say hello to</p><p>everybody joining Dr Burr&rsquo;s birthday</p><p>today thank you uh Terry for adding that</p><p>in from the UK Canada Mexico Sweden the</p><p>Philippines South Africa Trinidad and</p><p>Tobago the Netherlands Slovenia Mongolia</p><p>wholesale list Austria</p><p>uh Kenya India Germany Malaysia Portugal</p><p>Ethiopia Australia the Virgin Islands</p><p>France Norway Pakistan the United Arab</p><p>Emirates Switzerland Egypt Chile and</p><p>Nepal Italy Greece Belgium Oman Iran</p><p>Bangladesh Kuwait Thailand Austria</p><p>Armenia Peru Colombia Israel Poland</p><p>Finland and all across these United</p><p>States and is also as usual we&rsquo;re going</p><p>to have some more stragglers that are</p><p>coming to say don&rsquo;t forget about us so</p><p>that&rsquo;s a fantastic fantastic list I was</p><p>listening to a YouTube show uh uh I</p><p>don&rsquo;t know I can&rsquo;t remember the subject</p><p>matter but the host said oh my gosh look</p><p>we have a viewer from you know England</p><p>and oh my gosh and here&rsquo;s one from uh</p><p>you know somewhere else and I thought my</p><p>gosh if they listen to the list of Dr</p><p>Berg&rsquo;s listeners how extensive it is</p><p>they just throw their show away but</p><p>anyway but they were very excited to get</p><p>a couple folks that were out of the</p><p>contiguous so this is really quite a</p><p>phenomenon Dr Berg that you have all</p><p>these people listening from around the</p><p>globe uh let&rsquo;s see now uh</p><p>we posed the second question which is</p><p>hilarious why don&rsquo;t we go to our green</p><p>room and</p><p>um let&rsquo;s go to uh June from Juno Beach I</p><p>don&rsquo;t know if she designed that somehow</p><p>to rhyme but that&rsquo;s where she&rsquo;s at or</p><p>and let&rsquo;s see now if you&rsquo;ll unmute</p><p>yourself June I will too oh you did I</p><p>was the straggler and guess what John</p><p>with Dr Berg with your one question for</p><p>30 seconds please go</p><p>okay well first of all happy birthday</p><p>you&rsquo;re a blessing to me and I know to</p><p>all of us I wanted to ask you</p><p>um I am woken up at night from this heat</p><p>that ingredients</p><p>[Music]</p><p>and I can&rsquo;t get back to sleep I&rsquo;ve been</p><p>very successful in a short time on the</p><p>program thank you very much</p><p>um</p><p>[Music]</p><p>but this is where I&rsquo;m at and then it</p><p>just wakes me up my blood sugars have</p><p>been awesome</p><p>thank you</p><p>I&rsquo;m between 82 and 96.</p><p>did it start what what I&rsquo;m sorry what is</p><p>your what&rsquo;s your age</p><p>I am going to be 57 June okay great I</p><p>mean well I&rsquo;m 58 so uh we&rsquo;re a little</p><p>bit older but here&rsquo;s a question um did</p><p>this happen</p><p>um in your early 50s or recently or when</p><p>did it when did it start this started um</p><p>in the uh early 50s I don&rsquo;t have hot</p><p>flashes during the day</p><p>and I don&rsquo;t sweat</p><p>okay so there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s a definitely um</p><p>something in your</p><p>hypothalamus that uh is controlling</p><p>temperature of the body and it doesn&rsquo;t</p><p>necessarily have to be whether you have</p><p>sweat it&rsquo;s just a change in temperature</p><p>and it&rsquo;s actually in the same little</p><p>area as the center that controls the</p><p>ovaries so apparently there&rsquo;s this</p><p>glitch in the circuitry that the</p><p>adrenals are supposed to none take over</p><p>and everything&rsquo;s supposed to be fine but</p><p>apparently there&rsquo;s some</p><p>problems in the circuitry so we need to</p><p>fix that so how do you get rid of that</p><p>problem well there&rsquo;s a couple things</p><p>that I tell people to try of course like</p><p>seek help with the iodine lot sometimes</p><p>that works sometimes tocatrinal</p><p>Works other times you need to support</p><p>the adrenal itself with uh the whole</p><p>desk the desiccated adrenal</p><p>um like glandular that a lot of times</p><p>that&rsquo;ll help but these are just a couple</p><p>or three things that I always try and</p><p>sometimes you know you&rsquo;ll you&rsquo;ll get it</p><p>on one thing and then sometimes you</p><p>won&rsquo;t and then you have to try other</p><p>things but</p><p>I&rsquo;ve done some videos on this you</p><p>probably have watched them and you&rsquo;re</p><p>probably ordering and you have something</p><p>you&rsquo;re going to try but those are the</p><p>three most common reasons</p><p>and or things that you can take to</p><p>actually resolve it</p><p>um</p><p>and if it does it for some weird reason</p><p>if it doesn&rsquo;t resolve then um come back</p><p>because there&rsquo;s other things that you</p><p>can try as well</p><p>for example</p><p>there is a product from Standard Process</p><p>sometimes that I recommend is called</p><p>overtrofin PMG which um you know like if</p><p>you&rsquo;ve tried everything else and</p><p>nothing&rsquo;s worked like that that tends to</p><p>work but I wouldn&rsquo;t try that first</p><p>because I would try these other things</p><p>and that usually should help you so that</p><p>would be my quick suggestion but I&rsquo;m</p><p>glad you&rsquo;re regretting getting these</p><p>other results that&rsquo;s cool but of course</p><p>this heat thing is probably very</p><p>irritating because you need to sleep</p><p>wow well well anyway Junior I don&rsquo;t want</p><p>to step over Dr Berg&rsquo;s advice but you</p><p>live in South Florida how about Siberia</p><p>I think it&rsquo;s going to cure your problem</p><p>completely especially in the winter</p><p>months no we hope yeah there you go</p><p>that&rsquo;s another solution just move to the</p><p>north and stay in the cold and then you</p><p>have an internal heater that can counter</p><p>that problem yeah see I knew I was onto</p><p>something thank you June so much and I</p><p>hope that you get back with us and let</p><p>us know about your future successes</p><p>because I&rsquo;m sure you can come up with</p><p>something and I know Dr Berg is grateful</p><p>for your birthday wishes as well so why</p><p>don&rsquo;t we go on to the second quiz</p><p>question which has already been answered</p><p>um about a delicious recipe and it asks</p><p>what is healthier to eat the cereal from</p><p>Kellogg&rsquo;s Corn Pops or the box it came</p><p>in and 95 of our respondents say that</p><p>it&rsquo;s the box and the other five percent</p><p>says probably about the same</p><p>now there was a recall with Kellogg&rsquo;s</p><p>there was literally</p><p>um</p><p>millions and millions of millions of</p><p>boxes that were recalled with four</p><p>different</p><p>cereals I think it was um uh Fruit Loops</p><p>um honey something and uh Corn Pops and</p><p>one more and so they&rsquo;re like millions</p><p>and million box boxes were recalled</p><p>not because of anything in the in the</p><p>actual ingredients and it was actually</p><p>because of something in the Box itself</p><p>gave off the smell or this weird taste</p><p>that creates some nauseousness</p><p>so um apparently according to them the</p><p>box is uh worse than the actual material</p><p>on the inside so</p><p>I guess it&rsquo;s okay to eat the uh the</p><p>actual cereal just don&rsquo;t eat the box it</p><p>came in like every time you eat</p><p>something like that some of that box</p><p>does end up in the cereal it does leech</p><p>out and you&rsquo;re actually indirectly</p><p>eating the box so it might not be good</p><p>but</p><p>what&rsquo;s uh fascinating to me about some</p><p>of these cereals as I was looking I&rsquo;ve</p><p>added like Steve I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ve</p><p>ever been to a grocery store lately but</p><p>they&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re actually and this is</p><p>hard to believe there&rsquo;s actually entire</p><p>aisles that sell cereal entire aisles of</p><p>the grocery store that actually sell</p><p>cereal and uh you know I&rsquo;m sure kids I</p><p>can&rsquo;t imagine I know it&rsquo;s hard to</p><p>believe but I&rsquo;m just going what the if</p><p>you ever read what&rsquo;s in there</p><p>and um it&rsquo;s very funny though if you</p><p>look at um</p><p>you know Kellogg&rsquo;s what they say about</p><p>the cereal it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s part of a</p><p>nutrient dense diet I&rsquo;m not kidding</p><p>nutrient dense and and they can say that</p><p>because they&rsquo;re adding synthetic</p><p>vitamins to it because there&rsquo;s nothing</p><p>left but there&rsquo;s hydrogenated oils</p><p>there&rsquo;s um different types of sugar</p><p>there&rsquo;s maltodextrin and MSG and there&rsquo;s</p><p>just about every other thing you can</p><p>imagine but um</p><p>boy</p><p>um and they also did say that it&rsquo;s not</p><p>correlated with um with weight gain in</p><p>children</p><p>of course when you read that study</p><p>um what they did is they compared</p><p>eatiness I think some of that cereal</p><p>with uh</p><p>white bread or something like that so</p><p>anyway everything is relative</p><p>I&rsquo;ll get off the topic but um I would</p><p>definitely avoid eating the box if I</p><p>were you that sounds like something you</p><p>know Dr bergam is 69 so my childhood was</p><p>like Mayberry and Andy Griffiths and so</p><p>on and you could not find a heavy person</p><p>on the horizon when I was a kid if</p><p>someone was overweight it was a</p><p>spectacle because we all ran around</p><p>outside or whatever and we ate crappily</p><p>I mean we had you know uh Wonder Bread</p><p>with peanut butter and jelly but we just</p><p>burned it off and I remember you</p><p>mentioning a couple of the hands that</p><p>work with you on the uh on the farm</p><p>there that are just in great shape but</p><p>they eat moon pies and RC colas for</p><p>lunch but they don&rsquo;t stop all day so</p><p>there is a a benefit right I guess to</p><p>lower consumption or higher</p><p>um you know higher a greater deal of</p><p>exercise and when you combine uh Corn</p><p>Pops with uh sedentary lifestyle that&rsquo;s</p><p>just especially awful Isn&rsquo;t it</p><p>you could say that again you could</p><p>definitely say that again wow all right</p><p>let&rsquo;s see let&rsquo;s move on from there back</p><p>to</p><p>um social media a shout out to our</p><p>viewers in Saudi Arabia North Cyprus</p><p>Brunel Puerto Rico and Argentina okay</p><p>great I didn&rsquo;t want to leave them out</p><p>they called her from YouTube can you</p><p>talk about Hyperbaric treatments uh can</p><p>how they might help with cancer</p><p>you know I tried that I I like them a</p><p>lot I um it&rsquo;s great to help</p><p>um Drive oxygen into the deep part of</p><p>your body and and kind of resolve areas</p><p>of hypoxia and also a rehab of stroke</p><p>problems and I forgot to mention that as</p><p>well</p><p>um so I&rsquo;ve had people go in there and</p><p>help even grow part of their bone back</p><p>that&rsquo;s not been responding to typical</p><p>therapy so there&rsquo;s a lot of benefits</p><p>including um there&rsquo;s some research on</p><p>cancer so I don&rsquo;t have all the data but</p><p>I think it&rsquo;s worth to jump into but um</p><p>yeah you go into this uh just make sure</p><p>just make sure that when you go into one</p><p>of these tanks that you uh don&rsquo;t have</p><p>any static electricity in your</p><p>you know your undergarments if you&rsquo;re</p><p>wearing a t-shirt because we don&rsquo;t want</p><p>a spark in oxygen right that would be a</p><p>bad situation so I think they have that</p><p>result because they ground you when you</p><p>go in there but it&rsquo;s um I like it I like</p><p>it I do recommend it I think it&rsquo;s a</p><p>great great therapy for a lot of</p><p>different things</p><p>sorry about that doc let&rsquo;s see I got</p><p>distracted and that happens very easily</p><p>with me uh here we go let&rsquo;s go to</p><p>Facebook Michael uh what healthy</p><p>alternatives can you suggest to</p><p>commercial toothpaste is that an issue</p><p>I think it&rsquo;s a it is a minor issue but</p><p>it is an issue and I I have videos on</p><p>how to make your own toothpaste um but</p><p>there also is a you know convenient</p><p>um toothpaste that you can buy that are</p><p>alternative that doesn&rsquo;t have um the</p><p>fluorides in them I I don&rsquo;t like</p><p>fluoride in toothpaste</p><p>um I don&rsquo;t even recommend the fluoride</p><p>treatments for making your teeth whiter</p><p>because it leeches into the in the</p><p>system and it&rsquo;s very very um</p><p>um oxidizing and irritating to your</p><p>tissues and a good thing they don&rsquo;t put</p><p>that in the water supply and I&rsquo;m being</p><p>sarcastic because they do so you want to</p><p>get a</p><p>fluoride filter for your shower too to</p><p>pull it out and you&rsquo;re going to find</p><p>your skin it&rsquo;s going to be much better</p><p>if you don&rsquo;t expose it to uh that</p><p>fluoride not to mention chloride</p><p>all right very good why don&rsquo;t we kick it</p><p>off with another question these have</p><p>been so wonderful uh and here&rsquo;s a real</p><p>quick one a true falcer</p><p>okay true or false oatmeal is gluten</p><p>free</p><p>there you have it climb on it audience</p><p>and let&rsquo;s now go back to our green room</p><p>and let&rsquo;s pick on Nancy who&rsquo;s in</p><p>Maryland and Nancy if you would unmute</p><p>yourself you&rsquo;re on with Dr Berg for a</p><p>quick question please</p><p>happy birthday Dr Byrd thank you</p><p>um</p><p>I started eating natto from the store</p><p>for vitamin K and I have been off of</p><p>oligums for uh several years in order to</p><p>control my diabetes</p><p>no meds for years</p><p>will natto disrupt keto or my blood</p><p>sugar and is the GMO soy going to</p><p>disrupt my endocrine system</p><p>also is black soy natto nutritionally</p><p>equivalent to the white soy product</p><p>and would you consider a future video on</p><p>Khan&rsquo;s disease which is hyper</p><p>aldosteronism you know I I don&rsquo;t know if</p><p>I&rsquo;ll do a video on that simply because</p><p>it&rsquo;s not as common but I will maybe do a</p><p>blog post on that for sure but uh</p><p>sometimes there&rsquo;s all sorts of um things</p><p>that are just more rare that um</p><p>honestly like it would be just a</p><p>selective very small group of people but</p><p>uh let&rsquo;s talk about this NATO NATO is um</p><p>a fermented soybean not as popular in</p><p>the U.S but some people are learning</p><p>about it but</p><p>um it&rsquo;s very high in vitamin K2 very</p><p>good source about MK2 which is amazing</p><p>to drive the calcium into the bone to</p><p>keep the calcium out of the arteries</p><p>keep the calcium out of the joint so</p><p>that&rsquo;s uh that&rsquo;s good</p><p>um if you could find one non-GMO that</p><p>would be really good I&rsquo;m not crazy about</p><p>the GMO soy because you&rsquo;re going to get</p><p>um</p><p>that glyphosate that&rsquo;s an herbicide okay</p><p>that&rsquo;s an herbicide that&rsquo;s in so many</p><p>different things it&rsquo;s not just in GMO</p><p>food it&rsquo;s actually they use it as a way</p><p>to kill</p><p>um oats</p><p>and kill</p><p>um</p><p>kill off the wheat quickly so they can</p><p>dry it up as a drying agent</p><p>because it kills plants really fast but</p><p>it does um tend to mess with our</p><p>microbiome right in our guts and it is</p><p>um definitely</p><p>um considered a carcinogenic so it does</p><p>cause cancer but of course</p><p>Monsanto said no it doesn&rsquo;t it&rsquo;s</p><p>completely safe so they&rsquo;ve done their</p><p>own studies</p><p>um so the point is that um I would</p><p>probably find an organic one or get my</p><p>K2 from something else I&rsquo;m not sure</p><p>about the different forms of</p><p>black soil versus the other one I&rsquo;m not</p><p>sure about that um but if you want to</p><p>get a good source of vitamin K2 it&rsquo;s</p><p>actually in a lot of a fattier cheeses</p><p>and it&rsquo;s also an egg yolks and um</p><p>um</p><p>it&rsquo;s also in grass-fed butter a little</p><p>bit of K2 is in there or you can give us</p><p>a supplement so that would be my long</p><p>answer Nancy but um</p><p>thank you</p><p>that&rsquo;s great thanks so much Nancy for</p><p>joining us and please get back with us</p><p>you&rsquo;re welcome that&rsquo;s wonderful all</p><p>right let&rsquo;s see why don&rsquo;t we answer</p><p>another question and it was our third</p><p>question of the day which simply asked</p><p>true false oatmeal is gluten free and</p><p>simply answered</p><p>um</p><p>sixty percent of our respondents say</p><p>it&rsquo;s false and forty percent say it&rsquo;s</p><p>absolutely true</p><p>winners okay so yeah it&rsquo;s been known to</p><p>be um gluten free but but there&rsquo;s a diff</p><p>there is a type of</p><p>similar</p><p>chemical or protein similar to gluten</p><p>uh and about 50 of the people who are</p><p>already sensitive to gluten they&rsquo;ll have</p><p>a problem with oats okay so so it&rsquo;s the</p><p>answer is technically</p><p>it is gluten free but there&rsquo;s a similar</p><p>protein I think it&rsquo;s called Avan avanine</p><p>Avenue or something like that but anyway</p><p>this protein can um</p><p>create similar effects but it&rsquo;s delayed</p><p>as far as the effects so it&rsquo;s sometimes</p><p>hard to identify it when you eat it it</p><p>doesn&rsquo;t always create a reaction right</p><p>away it might take several days later so</p><p>you might not connect the dots and this</p><p>is a problem with a lot of things that</p><p>you know all of a sudden you start</p><p>getting headaches for example out of the</p><p>blue for no reason it could have been</p><p>something that you consume two days</p><p>previously</p><p>so anyway uh that being said</p><p>um</p><p>oatmeal is um you know</p><p>a lot of people have it for the fiber</p><p>and unfortunately</p><p>um we&rsquo;ll talk more about fiber in just a</p><p>minute but uh</p><p>there&rsquo;s much better uh breakfast foods</p><p>and that would be like eggs things like</p><p>that</p><p>um but I know a lot of people will not</p><p>give up their oatmeal because</p><p>you know they have uncles that have</p><p>eaten it and they&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re 95 years</p><p>old and they&rsquo;re fine so might as well</p><p>keep doing it absolutely here&rsquo;s some</p><p>more gushing for you Dr Berg Ruth from</p><p>Facebook thank you Dr Berg for your many</p><p>videos to help us uh stay healthy my</p><p>husband and I watch you frequently so</p><p>have a wonderful birthday and thank you</p><p>for your kind and giving heart we so</p><p>appreciate you so isn&rsquo;t that great doc</p><p>that&rsquo;s awesome all right thank you and</p><p>here&rsquo;s some other ones that want to</p><p>selfishly ring information out of you so</p><p>go to Gina from Facebook what is a good</p><p>remedy for dry skin caused by guttate</p><p>psoriasis you hear that one</p><p>now</p><p>um</p><p>if you have dry skin the the best</p><p>antidote for that would be um</p><p>the um it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s actually an oil uh you</p><p>want more essential fatty acids like the</p><p>omega-3 fatty acids but specifically</p><p>that is called GLA</p><p>um which is a type of fat that you can</p><p>get in borage oil</p><p>I&rsquo;m sorry not Voyage oil it&rsquo;s a black</p><p>currant seed oil that would be the best</p><p>black currant seed oil um helps in that</p><p>conversion of the um the oils to</p><p>something that you&rsquo;re</p><p>sebaceous glands which are the oil</p><p>glands can actually accept and</p><p>um</p><p>that should help your skin overall but</p><p>you can do it topically or I would</p><p>recommend just taking it as a supplement</p><p>and you definitely want to avoid the</p><p>Omega the other common omega-6 fatty</p><p>acids even though GLA is an omega-6 you</p><p>want to take um you want to avoid the</p><p>soy corn canola those oils because that</p><p>can throw off this GLA oil that&rsquo;s</p><p>actually really good for the skin</p><p>especially if you get like dry flaky</p><p>skin that is an Omega</p><p>fatty acid deficiency because you&rsquo;re</p><p>having too many of the wrong ones</p><p>okay very good</p><p>roses and daisies is a person&rsquo;s name</p><p>from YouTube how can you increase</p><p>aromatase or estrogen production in a</p><p>pre-menopausal females that necessary</p><p>Don</p><p>I don&rsquo;t think you want to do that I</p><p>don&rsquo;t think you want to increase the</p><p>Roma taste that&rsquo;s going to turn the</p><p>testosterone into more estrogen I don&rsquo;t</p><p>think that&rsquo;s the best way to do it I</p><p>think um</p><p>another way that if you want to balance</p><p>out your estrogens to make sure you have</p><p>let&rsquo;s say a nicer balance so there&rsquo;s</p><p>less of the</p><p>the harmful one more of the others</p><p>um cruciferous vegetables will do it</p><p>that will do it so</p><p>um but yeah you don&rsquo;t want to start to</p><p>do increasing aromatase because it&rsquo;s</p><p>gonna</p><p>create problems yeah don&rsquo;t fiddle with</p><p>that huh okay heimel from YouTube I have</p><p>a sun allergy after a c-section that&rsquo;s</p><p>interesting I tried B3 as you suggested</p><p>but it&rsquo;s not working I eat only organic</p><p>foods and not on any Pharmaceuticals</p><p>well else can heimel try Dr Berg</p><p>yeah I&rsquo;m doing a lot of DNA testing and</p><p>I&rsquo;m finding a lot of people</p><p>um a lot of people have a have a</p><p>resistance against vitamin D</p><p>and so</p><p>um Believe It or Not vitamin D actually</p><p>can protect against some of the UV</p><p>radiation and</p><p>um so vitamin D would be one thing to</p><p>take as a supplement especially if you</p><p>have some genetic problem with that but</p><p>the other thing is vitamin B1 B1 helps</p><p>to tolerate</p><p>um</p><p>problems with either too much irritation</p><p>from too much sun or heat</p><p>or even cold so let&rsquo;s say for example</p><p>you&rsquo;re sensitive to heat or cold or sun</p><p>then vitamin B will help you so that way</p><p>you can tolerate more of that of these</p><p>extreme temperatures and definitely jump</p><p>into that ice bath that you&rsquo;ve been</p><p>dying to jump into and tolerate it</p><p>okay some people just are going to hang</p><p>onto this oatmeal thing and that one is</p><p>and from Facebook what are your thoughts</p><p>on sprouted oatmeal is that a phenomena</p><p>or something good I think that&rsquo;s awesome</p><p>I think that&rsquo;s a great option in fact</p><p>you can you can eat as much grain if you</p><p>as you want as long as you sprout them</p><p>and Sprout them into microgreens and put</p><p>those on your salad that way you can</p><p>have your grains and you get all the</p><p>phytonutrients and without the</p><p>anti-nutrients which is the phytic acid</p><p>so that would be a really smart solution</p><p>wow Terry I thought he might fuss with</p><p>you but no you&rsquo;re on the right track so</p><p>keep keep on sprouting sounds like a</p><p>great thing to do all right let&rsquo;s uh go</p><p>back for another question here this is a</p><p>true falcer and as promised doc someone</p><p>was asking about constipation and here</p><p>you go</p><p>okay question true or false constipation</p><p>is caused by a lack of fiber in the diet</p><p>what do you think audience</p><p>okay let&rsquo;s see um</p><p>we already asked about toothpaste and</p><p>you said go for that let me look here</p><p>I had a stroke</p><p>uh</p><p>oh here&rsquo;s interesting pure Spirit from</p><p>YouTube what are your thoughts about red</p><p>light therapy</p><p>I think it&rsquo;s awesome awesome the red</p><p>right therapy gives you infrared and it</p><p>has all sorts of really cool benefits it</p><p>can increase uh melatonin not I mean</p><p>this is a melatonin that&rsquo;s in your whole</p><p>body which is a very powerful</p><p>antioxidant and it&rsquo;s not just about</p><p>hearing your sleep cycles so it&rsquo;s one of</p><p>the most powerful antioxidants so</p><p>there&rsquo;s people use red light therapy to</p><p>um from many different reasons but it</p><p>penetrates the body in fact over 50</p><p>percent of the sun Sun&rsquo;s rays are</p><p>infrared and you also get infrared when</p><p>the sun sets so um sitting you know at</p><p>night when you watch the sun set you</p><p>actually get get some good more</p><p>infrared and it&rsquo;s easier to be be</p><p>exposed to that and also a campfire or a</p><p>fireplace or a candle you can get</p><p>infrared but infrared is um very</p><p>therapeutic for pain inflammation and</p><p>overall healing uh I like it people use</p><p>have these lasers for their skin and for</p><p>their brain health and but it does</p><p>penetrate a couple inches into the body</p><p>so I&rsquo;ve done a whole video on that I&rsquo;ve</p><p>done several videos on that laughs</p><p>I mean cough button</p><p>I can&rsquo;t believe it I pushed the button</p><p>then start coughing that&rsquo;s not the way</p><p>it&rsquo;s supposed to work okay</p><p>excuse me audience while I choked it out</p><p>okay the uh</p><p>fourth question was quickly asked</p><p>there&rsquo;s a true false or constipation is</p><p>the cause is caused by a lack of fiber</p><p>in the diet and as usual our audience</p><p>has an opinion 65 percent of them say</p><p>it&rsquo;s false and 35 percent say it&rsquo;s true</p><p>anyone left embarrassed here doc you</p><p>know it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s always this everyone</p><p>knows that it&rsquo;s lack of fiber right just</p><p>eat more fiber you know here&rsquo;s the</p><p>here&rsquo;s the data on that and I&rsquo;m going to</p><p>create a video on this the great</p><p>majority of people have constipation</p><p>especially chronic constipation are</p><p>already consuming a lot of fiber it&rsquo;s</p><p>not working so that I mean think about</p><p>what constipation is it&rsquo;s a traffic jam</p><p>you&rsquo;re completely impacted you&rsquo;re</p><p>congested right and then to add more</p><p>fiber which adds more bulk and and</p><p>volume to an already over congested</p><p>colon would that make logical sense</p><p>Steve what do you think</p><p>I&rsquo;m guessing no no it&rsquo;s not a good thing</p><p>you you&rsquo;re gonna find you&rsquo;re going to</p><p>find that if you actually reduce the</p><p>fiber you probably will your</p><p>constipation will probably go away now</p><p>this is one of those things that goes</p><p>against</p><p>consent the medical consensus but it</p><p>it&rsquo;s true I remember</p><p>um switching or meeting all this fiber</p><p>and of course I was doing fiber from my</p><p>so-called whole you know whole grain</p><p>diet</p><p>um with beans and everything I remember</p><p>going to uh just more meats and</p><p>hamburger and I was like why are my my</p><p>bowel movements are so much better</p><p>because</p><p>um it was just bizarre but the point is</p><p>that the fiber sometimes for for a lot</p><p>of people can bind them up now I&rsquo;m the</p><p>guy that recommends vegetables right but</p><p>if you take them and it binds you up</p><p>that means you need to do carnivore if</p><p>you it means that you probably have some</p><p>low grade inflammation or something</p><p>going on with the colon in which case</p><p>you can&rsquo;t tolerate those vegetable</p><p>fibers but if you can I would recommend</p><p>it because there&rsquo;s a lot of benefits</p><p>in Plants but</p><p>um I also think you should do Meats at</p><p>the same time for those people that have</p><p>a</p><p>low tolerance they can&rsquo;t they just have</p><p>they don&rsquo;t tolerate red meat and things</p><p>like that it&rsquo;s probably because they</p><p>don&rsquo;t have enough stomach acid to digest</p><p>it more than anything else</p><p>so that&rsquo;s a whole different topic</p><p>alrighty Danette from YouTube I have</p><p>scoliosis and polymyalgia any natural</p><p>ways to address these conditions</p><p>well I would get on it get in a um a</p><p>really good</p><p>um ketogenic diet reduce inflammation</p><p>okay</p><p>um in your joints and but with scoliosis</p><p>chances are the the underlying root</p><p>cause of that um happen when you&rsquo;re</p><p>really young because somehow you were</p><p>deficient in vitamin D which can create</p><p>um all sorts of structural skeletal</p><p>problems in life</p><p>so unfortunately if the bones if you&rsquo;re</p><p>older now it&rsquo;s not it&rsquo;s going to be hard</p><p>to reverse that and in fact probably POS</p><p>impossible because the Bones have</p><p>already grown in the S shape so you&rsquo;re</p><p>going to have to work on a lot of</p><p>stretching and myofascial stretching</p><p>that&rsquo;s what you want to do is you want</p><p>to stretch the fascia the fascia through</p><p>the body and that&rsquo;s um there&rsquo;s you can</p><p>just look that up on YouTube and do that</p><p>but that&rsquo;ll probably give you the most</p><p>relief</p><p>um out of anything</p><p>um but uh yeah that&rsquo;s a that&rsquo;s</p><p>definitely a situation but um in reduced</p><p>the inflammation too by omega-6 fatty</p><p>acids a really good</p><p>uh natural remedy for inflammation I</p><p>like is nettle root stingy nettle root</p><p>it&rsquo;s uh quite and you can grow it it&rsquo;s</p><p>very easy to grow it&rsquo;s like it grows</p><p>like a weed it&rsquo;s probably even growing</p><p>in your backyard and</p><p>um</p><p>you can go ahead and take that and put</p><p>it into a tea or a in the blender and</p><p>put it in your salad and eat it yum okay</p><p>let&rsquo;s go back to the Green Room little</p><p>needles in it so be careful of that very</p><p>good and Beth anticipated I was going to</p><p>call on her because she snapped to</p><p>attention and she&rsquo;s in front of the</p><p>camera and she&rsquo;s now determined to ask</p><p>you one question and get it out in 30</p><p>seconds Beth go</p><p>happy birthday Dr Berg</p><p>um I&rsquo;m questioning about what</p><p>supplements to take to heal thyroid it&rsquo;s</p><p>hyperthyroidism and</p><p>um I want to get off the medication</p><p>which hasn&rsquo;t been helping me and also</p><p>wanted to know if the prolonged fasting</p><p>will hurt my thyroid or not</p><p>I think the prolonged fasting will help</p><p>your thyroid because</p><p>um it the thyroid can is all about</p><p>um</p><p>metabolism and so</p><p>um it&rsquo;s going to work less if you don&rsquo;t</p><p>eat but do you have an autoimmune</p><p>hyperthyroidism</p><p>one time my doctor said that it was or</p><p>wrote that it was Hashimoto&rsquo;s but she&rsquo;s</p><p>never actually told me that it was</p><p>Hashimoto&rsquo;s</p><p>so it was it hyper or hypo because um</p><p>hypo okay yeah so selenium selenium</p><p>that&rsquo;s the trace mineral that you need</p><p>mostly</p><p>um that&rsquo;s the thing that I would</p><p>recommend because that&rsquo;s going to build</p><p>up the</p><p>um the glutathione that&rsquo;s going to be</p><p>um the detoxer the thing that you really</p><p>want to avoid make sure you avoid like</p><p>the plague is any any type of gluten</p><p>because gluten has been known to um</p><p>trigger that autoimmune and start</p><p>working on your gut too</p><p>um probiotics things to heal the gut</p><p>that&rsquo;s been a really good effective</p><p>remedy for the autoimmune as well as</p><p>higher amounts of vitamin D3 and then</p><p>lastly it wouldn&rsquo;t hurt to do a good DNA</p><p>test because</p><p>you know as I&rsquo;m looking at the DNA test</p><p>there&rsquo;s a whole bunch of um interesting</p><p>information on why someone could</p><p>potentially</p><p>have continued health problems and it</p><p>could be related to</p><p>a whole spectrum of things but without</p><p>getting that test you&rsquo;re just guessing</p><p>you know sometimes it&rsquo;s the</p><p>boy my body doesn&rsquo;t detoxify other times</p><p>it doesn&rsquo;t make antioxidants so I have</p><p>oxidative stress other times it&rsquo;s um</p><p>I&rsquo;m not able to absorb B12 that well or</p><p>um</p><p>or have iron overload all these things</p><p>can create a problem I&rsquo;ve actually just</p><p>did two recently uh and they had</p><p>problems with iron they accumulate iron</p><p>and I&rsquo;m like</p><p>wow that&rsquo;s important to know here you</p><p>are trying to get healthy and all of a</p><p>sudden you take red meat and you feel</p><p>worse well it&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s too much</p><p>iron</p><p>so</p><p>um there&rsquo;s all sorts of great data you</p><p>can get I will be doing more videos on</p><p>that topic</p><p>um very soon but there&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s a big</p><p>project so</p><p>hang in there</p><p>sounds great and Beth I&rsquo;m going to give</p><p>you a little trade secret here and if</p><p>you want to watch more videos from Dr</p><p>Berg conveniently you&rsquo;re going to want</p><p>to immediately download his app and</p><p>that&rsquo;s for Android or for iOS so that&rsquo;s</p><p>another organized way of getting through</p><p>the wonderful information the doc has</p><p>available</p><p>and uh Beth please get back with us and</p><p>let us know how you&rsquo;re doing we always</p><p>love to hear the aftermath of a</p><p>successful regime okay Kareem from</p><p>YouTube he&rsquo;s 18 and been diagnosed with</p><p>stage two Hodgkins my doctor said I&rsquo;ll</p><p>start chemo in three weeks and he&rsquo;s</p><p>scared of it</p><p>um you know anything that he could do I</p><p>mean is that something well I know you</p><p>don&rsquo;t want to well there&rsquo;s definitely</p><p>um</p><p>one point about Non-Hodgkin&rsquo;s lymphoma</p><p>there&rsquo;s a high correlation with the</p><p>glyphosate</p><p>yeah</p><p>so um what I would do is I would um</p><p>research that and completely and utterly</p><p>get that out of the diet I would watch</p><p>my cancer videos I would start doing a</p><p>prolonged fast start doing that and then</p><p>do the protocol that is recommended for</p><p>that now again these are none of my</p><p>supplements so I&rsquo;m not trying to</p><p>tell you that there&rsquo;s any cures but if</p><p>you&rsquo;re doing I think it could be done</p><p>parallel with what you&rsquo;re doing with</p><p>your doctor but of course check with</p><p>your doctor before implementing that</p><p>and um</p><p>so that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s what I would recommend</p><p>very good uh all the best to you Kareem</p><p>and I guess that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s Roundup isn&rsquo;t</p><p>it is that glyphosphate or</p><p>that&rsquo;s correct and even in Roundup</p><p>they&rsquo;ve even found that there&rsquo;s some</p><p>additional additives</p><p>that create problems as well in the</p><p>Roundup that&rsquo;s not even glyphosate so</p><p>and uh it&rsquo;s very hard to um</p><p>find out what those are but they have</p><p>identified it and um I think it&rsquo;s one of</p><p>my videos that I did on this but so it&rsquo;s</p><p>not just glyphosate it&rsquo;s the whole</p><p>package that it comes with</p><p>all right very good let&rsquo;s go back to a</p><p>truth false or hang up</p><p>let&rsquo;s go to our final question here and</p><p>here it is Dot</p><p>okay so what is the best way to increase</p><p>microbial diversity in your gut</p><p>okay fascinating question audience climb</p><p>on it please and let&rsquo;s see we have this</p><p>is really interesting a disembodied gas</p><p>named Richard and he&rsquo;s floating around</p><p>out there in The Ether somewhere and he</p><p>doesn&rsquo;t have a picture but uh Earth to</p><p>Richard are you there</p><p>I&rsquo;m here there you go go ahead with your</p><p>one question 30 seconds from The Ether</p><p>happy birthday hey thanks</p><p>so</p><p>I&rsquo;m 76 years old I was born with</p><p>excessive amount of mucus and gas that</p><p>I&rsquo;ve had every moment of my life I&rsquo;ve</p><p>tried a number of different things to</p><p>deal with it including um going on a</p><p>fruit diet in 1971 for eight years</p><p>because I read the mucous diet healing</p><p>system so I&rsquo;ve tried a lot of different</p><p>things I&rsquo;ve been trying to figure out</p><p>how to determine where the mucus</p><p>originates you said it could be in the</p><p>back of the throat it could be in the</p><p>larynx the sinuses</p><p>and um</p><p>I have a lot of other questions too</p><p>which I&rsquo;d like to ask you but let&rsquo;s</p><p>start with that I think there&rsquo;s a I&rsquo;m</p><p>glad you gave me two at least two things</p><p>to kind of look at because there is a</p><p>connection between both of these right</p><p>here if we take a look at what gas is</p><p>yes it could be from some foods that</p><p>you&rsquo;re eating including fruit that can</p><p>increase gas but typically</p><p>having gas usually means low stomach</p><p>acid and it just so happens if you have</p><p>low stomach acid you could also have</p><p>generated more mucus that kind of can</p><p>come up all the way up into esophagus up</p><p>through the back of the throat believe</p><p>it or not so what I would do at least</p><p>try if I were you is I would start</p><p>taking betaine hydrochloride and take</p><p>small amounts like maybe one with a meal</p><p>and then each meal add another one</p><p>throughout the meal as you&rsquo;re chewing</p><p>and swallowing so you can spread it out</p><p>until you achieve a state of no more gas</p><p>and and see if that affects the mucus</p><p>too because it could be</p><p>coming up because the valve is enclosing</p><p>for some reason I tried beating oh sorry</p><p>yeah go ahead I tried beating</p><p>hydrochloride and I on two of them it</p><p>there was an intense burning sensation</p><p>okay so if there&rsquo;s an intense burning on</p><p>just two of them what that tells me you</p><p>probably have because it&rsquo;s been going on</p><p>so long right atopic gastritis that is</p><p>another condition that&rsquo;s very common</p><p>um especially as you get older where the</p><p>you start losing the stomach uh the wall</p><p>of the mucosal layer and then the body</p><p>overcompensate with more mucus but you</p><p>start losing the the production of</p><p>hydrochloric acid the cells that make it</p><p>and then the body will start making more</p><p>it kind of comp overcompensates so it</p><p>creates more problems and more acid or a</p><p>gastric acid and uh so now you have the</p><p>situation where you might be very very</p><p>deficient in B12 because there&rsquo;s a</p><p>connection between</p><p>something else connected to that so B12</p><p>and folate is something that you</p><p>probably want to take in the right forms</p><p>too like the methyl versions of that</p><p>um that if it&rsquo;s uh one good remedy for a</p><p>atropic gastritis would be sulforaphane</p><p>in the Sprouts if you can grow them</p><p>yourself that would be best especially</p><p>like cabbage Sprouts or consume cabbage</p><p>that might be a good thing to start</p><p>healing that stomach but</p><p>um I will be releasing a video soon on</p><p>digestion that I talk more about that in</p><p>more an extensive way so we can get into</p><p>it more but uh start looking at the</p><p>atropic gastritis because I think the</p><p>problem is we have to acidify the</p><p>stomach to fix it but we can&rsquo;t because</p><p>there&rsquo;s</p><p>there&rsquo;s inflammation still in the</p><p>stomach itself so you have to heal that</p><p>with various things and then eventually</p><p>acidify it and then you&rsquo;ll probably be a</p><p>lot better hey Richard I wish we had</p><p>more time for some questions but</p><p>unfortunately we&rsquo;re on a short clock but</p><p>please do follow Dr Berg&rsquo;s</p><p>recommendations of watching his videos</p><p>and then uh talk anyone can write you a</p><p>Dr Berg drberg.com is that right not</p><p>that you can answer all of anyone could</p><p>write me I don&rsquo;t know if they&rsquo;ll they&rsquo;ll</p><p>get a response now but no I&rsquo;m just</p><p>kidding um now that&rsquo;s what we do the um</p><p>that&rsquo;s why we do this show here because</p><p>um I mean I just like even the video</p><p>that I did I think it was yesterday</p><p>within the first couple hours there was</p><p>four thousand</p><p>you know comments and questions so it&rsquo;s</p><p>like it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s hard to do this so I&rsquo;m</p><p>thinking about just giving out my cell</p><p>phone number so I can just one by one</p><p>answer it but that&rsquo;s that would be crazy</p><p>so</p><p>um I think the best thing to do is kind</p><p>of just write it in the comments I do</p><p>read these a lot and I&rsquo;ll start doing a</p><p>video on the questions and but I&rsquo;m</p><p>telling you I&rsquo;d say</p><p>90 of most the questions are in a video</p><p>the problem is just trying to find them</p><p>right and so</p><p>I&rsquo;m creating some books right now and</p><p>also on the um if you go to my even my</p><p>website Dr Berg it&rsquo;s easier to search</p><p>specific things than on YouTube</p><p>okay very good by the way I&rsquo;ve got your</p><p>cell phone uh right here audience you&rsquo;re</p><p>ready</p><p>I better not do that all right let&rsquo;s see</p><p>but you do hey Richard a second well I&rsquo;m</p><p>just following your your guidance and I</p><p>know anyway I did I did a video I did a</p><p>video once and uh</p><p>um</p><p>in person with someone and they somehow</p><p>my cell phone got on the video and all</p><p>of a sudden I started getting all these</p><p>calls from people all over the place and</p><p>I&rsquo;m like how did you get my number</p><p>so yeah wow all right so uh put another</p><p>video yeah so yeah absolutely let me see</p><p>here Dr Berg uh</p><p>uh let&rsquo;s uh I think we&rsquo;ve got everybody</p><p>in the green room that&rsquo;s terrific dead</p><p>man six from YouTube my wife uh is a</p><p>Kidney donor is it safe for her to do</p><p>the keto diet I guess she&rsquo;s already</p><p>given up the kidney</p><p>well I think you have well you have well</p><p>one kidney or you have a new one that um</p><p>I think she donated it yeah</p><p>you know if you have advanced</p><p>Advanced kidney disease well then that&rsquo;s</p><p>a whole different topic because</p><p>um you have to be in a special diet but</p><p>if it&rsquo;s not Advanced uh I think a</p><p>ketogenic diet can protect the kidneys</p><p>because it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s very gentle it&rsquo;s a</p><p>very anti-inflammatory and um</p><p>even with the the type that I recommend</p><p>that the more vegetables the the</p><p>potassium is very um it&rsquo;s protective of</p><p>the kidney this whole idea that you</p><p>can&rsquo;t have potassium</p><p>because it&rsquo;s going to just destroy the</p><p>kidney is</p><p>completely a lie because it&rsquo;s only if</p><p>you have advanced end stage kidney</p><p>failure when you can&rsquo;t have potassium</p><p>and phosphorus and other things so um</p><p>then people associate oh my gosh</p><p>then I can&rsquo;t have potassium at all no no</p><p>you need you need potassium for the</p><p>kidney believe me</p><p>okay very good let&rsquo;s see</p><p>what uh Anil from Facebook what is the</p><p>best treatment for hypertension for a</p><p>female over 65 years of age</p><p>well the the two things that jump right</p><p>out</p><p>um vitamin D will help lower blood</p><p>pressure more vitamin D</p><p>also potassium will lower blood pressure</p><p>those are the two ones and I&rsquo;m assuming</p><p>you&rsquo;re on the ketogenic diet because</p><p>having too many carbs can</p><p>create stiffening of the arteries</p><p>and that can increase the blood pressure</p><p>as well</p><p>um</p><p>I would say 90 of all hypertension is</p><p>idiopathic</p><p>and you&rsquo;re probably going what does that</p><p>mean it means idiopathic means unknown</p><p>cause</p><p>they don&rsquo;t know in fact it goes along</p><p>with a lot of other diseases but I would</p><p>say out of that vitamin D is probably at</p><p>the top of the list and also potassium</p><p>so those are the two things I would try</p><p>first</p><p>okay very good our final question today</p><p>asked and we got to them all very proud</p><p>of that what is the best way to increase</p><p>microbial diversity in your gut and our</p><p>astute audience 80 percent said</p><p>fermented feuds like kimchi and</p><p>sauerkraut 10 say probiotics and the</p><p>last 10 percent say prebiotics</p><p>guess what everyone is correct because</p><p>if you actually if you can</p><p>um give eat a food that has um a variety</p><p>of microbes now think about this you can</p><p>get a probiotic right and if you look at</p><p>the back of the label it&rsquo;ll just it&rsquo;ll</p><p>say like maybe between 1 3 10 maybe if</p><p>you&rsquo;re lucky 15 different strains but</p><p>guess how many strains you have in</p><p>sauerkraut or kimchi or even kefir</p><p>you have hundreds of different or even</p><p>thousands of different of strains of</p><p>microbes so talk so getting eating more</p><p>Diversified microbes will improve your</p><p>diversity but also diversity of foods so</p><p>Steve let me ask you when you eat a</p><p>salad what type of lettuce leaf do you</p><p>use in your salad</p><p>Dr Berg I can&rsquo;t hear you hello are you</p><p>there no I I actually Iceberg yeah</p><p>Iceberg and I do like salads I mean I&rsquo;m</p><p>not a good guy all the times with diet</p><p>but I love salad so iceberg is what I</p><p>generally use and sometimes I guess</p><p>Romaine</p><p>okay so if you were to go to the grocery</p><p>store like I know you do and you shop</p><p>for your family and your wife you should</p><p>buy a variety of plants things you</p><p>haven&rsquo;t tried before and make your salad</p><p>with different types of plants and</p><p>um and salad leaves not just the same</p><p>the diversity of those different plants</p><p>will start to increase the diversity of</p><p>your gut and you will find that that&rsquo;s</p><p>going to improve so many things for your</p><p>immune system to your digestion and so</p><p>you know stick some parsley and cilantro</p><p>in there and all sorts of things don&rsquo;t</p><p>just have like one thing</p><p>um and also if you add in micro greens</p><p>that are grown in actual soil whether</p><p>you make them yourself or buy them</p><p>it&rsquo;s hard to find them on soil believe</p><p>it or not we just had them tested we</p><p>went we I was sent into the lab had them</p><p>tested because I was curious</p><p>you talk about</p><p>hundreds and hundreds of different</p><p>strains of microbes in that micro grain</p><p>hundreds of difference of microbes</p><p>you&rsquo;re actually eating a probiotic when</p><p>you&rsquo;re eating some of these plants and</p><p>uh I looked at one of the microorganisms</p><p>and I looked at also</p><p>the DNA</p><p>the proteins in that in the microgreen</p><p>and I&rsquo;ve I was I was I&rsquo;m not done</p><p>evaluating but just one thing like these</p><p>things they have programs to make</p><p>vitamin B1 so they&rsquo;re making B1</p><p>um it&rsquo;s fascinating so there&rsquo;s a there&rsquo;s</p><p>a lot more than just uh the vitamins and</p><p>minerals and phytonutrients in some of</p><p>these soil based healthy plants there</p><p>are microbes that you can get they have</p><p>their own microbiome that you can take</p><p>as a probiotic Believe It or Not wow so</p><p>you know I&rsquo;m really excited Lori and I</p><p>and I know the audience is too about the</p><p>idea of growing some stuff in the house</p><p>I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ve launched a video</p><p>on that or not but man I&rsquo;d love to start</p><p>that what we&rsquo;re doing is we&rsquo;re um I&rsquo;m</p><p>working now</p><p>with this with this Farm we&rsquo;re growing</p><p>our own ingredients it&rsquo;s a big project</p><p>but we&rsquo;re also</p><p>um I have a very uh awesome expert</p><p>farmer who&rsquo;s helping me with this so he</p><p>we&rsquo;re actually um he specializes in</p><p>microgreens he&rsquo;s gonna he&rsquo;s creating a</p><p>course right now</p><p>um just to teach people how to grow</p><p>their own food in their house</p><p>um not just for cost benefits but for um</p><p>making the healthiest salad you ever had</p><p>and I know this might be shocking but</p><p>not Everyone likes to eat 10 cups of</p><p>salad a day so you could do a small</p><p>amount of microgreens a very tiny bit</p><p>and get a similar uh nutrients so that</p><p>would be another benefit for Steve</p><p>yay</p><p>and maybe you can replace your iceberg</p><p>lettuce uh with some of that Steve I</p><p>mean come on Iceberg come on well they</p><p>got a whole big case of it over there at</p><p>Food Lion so</p><p>oh my goodness I&rsquo;ll I&rsquo;ll get with you</p><p>later Steve on that we&rsquo;ll have a</p><p>consultation all right on that on that</p><p>no I want to just say thank you for</p><p>everyone for um the wonderful um</p><p>birthday wishes I appreciate that all</p><p>your attention the comments have a</p><p>wonderful weekend and uh like I said</p><p>before it&rsquo;s I&rsquo;m not looking forward to</p><p>being in my 40s but um but it&rsquo;s rough</p><p>you know but have a great weekend I will</p><p>see you next week same time same place</p><p>[Music]</p></section><footer
