<p>I did a video on her and on her</p>
<p>confusion and and we basically got sixty</p>
<p>seven hundred views an hour it&rsquo;s blowing</p>
<p>up and yeah I think it&rsquo;s been three days</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re it&rsquo;s like twenty five hundred</p>
<p>years an hour so there&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>interest in this time as a personal</p>
<p>trainer</p>
<p>he doesn&rsquo;t have formal science training</p>
<p>oh yeah she&rsquo;s a TV celebrity she&rsquo;s not a</p>
<p>scientist</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s clinician no I know she has a as a</p>
<p>major confusion on insulin she doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>understand what that word is and what it</p>
<p>does so yeah yeah I know so a couple</p>
<p>things I wanted just to kind of bring up</p>
<p>you you&rsquo;ve recently read you recently</p>
<p>wrote two books and you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re on</p>
<p>your next one actually you you have a</p>
<p>lot of books but one of the books</p>
<p>actually I&rsquo;m we&rsquo;re gonna I&rsquo;m actually</p>
<p>currently working well I&rsquo;m not gonna</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna two books one for next year</p>
<p>and the year after so I&rsquo;m doing in</p>
<p>parallel you know I can&rsquo;t just work on</p>
<p>one project I have to do several things</p>
<p>at once I just get bored so I have to</p>
<p>kind of mala it&rsquo;s not a board thing it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just that there&rsquo;s they&rsquo;re really</p>
<p>important topics that need to be to be</p>
<p>out there so and</p>
<p>one of them is personal to us for</p>
<p>longevity so that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s you know as</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m writing the book I&rsquo;m learning things</p>
<p>and applying them for myself so by the</p>
<p>time the book is written I&rsquo;ll have had a</p>
<p>lot of experience and personally be able</p>
<p>to validate many of these strategies</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s great</p>
<p>the first topic I want to bring up this</p>
<p>in a minute fasting um</p>
<p>your your next book that you&rsquo;re writing</p>
<p>your you found some interesting data</p>
<p>with detoxing like when people do I</p>
<p>think you you know most of the toxins</p>
<p>are stored in the fat cell so what</p>
<p>happens if you detox org fast too long</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a potential of detoxing some of</p>
<p>these chemicals tell us bread yeah so</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s actually it&rsquo;s not intermittent</p>
<p>intermittent fasting was my last book</p>
<p>with bad for fuel which essentially</p>
<p>describes a process that is necessary to</p>
<p>become metabolically flexible and you</p>
<p>can actually regain the ability to burn</p>
<p>fat because I would say 3/4 of the</p>
<p>population aren&rsquo;t able to do this</p>
<p>because of their consistent indulgences</p>
<p>and excessive carbohydrates which</p>
<p>essentially shuts down their ability to</p>
<p>burn fat effectively and they develop</p>
<p>insulin resistance and then secondarily</p>
<p>all these other metabolic consequences</p>
<p>especially obesity so that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>baseline if you you know to stab</p>
<p>establish metabolic flexibility and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s typically done with a compressed</p>
<p>eating window which is the most one of</p>
<p>those profoundly simple and effective</p>
<p>strategies to regain health is just to</p>
<p>restrict and time your that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>eating the window eating period to about</p>
<p>six to eight hours and you mate</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s shocked me but I guess it</p>
<p>shouldn&rsquo;t have that ninety percent nine</p>
<p>out of ten people eat more than twelve</p>
<p>hours a day</p>
<p>let alone six or eight we&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>twelve twelve hours it&rsquo;s not natural</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just not natural but we&rsquo;re so used</p>
<p>to it it&rsquo;s this what&rsquo;s your thoughts on</p>
<p>this I mean massive habit of just</p>
<p>snacking like it&rsquo;s almost like you</p>
<p>people can&rsquo;t even go a few hours without</p>
<p>eat they have to constantly snack</p>
<p>that has pushed on us I&rsquo;m not opposed to</p>
<p>snacking it&rsquo;s not like a magic you have</p>
<p>one or two meals in fact I have a six</p>
<p>hour</p>
<p>window and I eat liberally in those six</p>
<p>hours I said you know and but before</p>
<p>those six hours or after those six hours</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t eat well that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m talking</p>
<p>about I&rsquo;m talking about like yeah night</p>
<p>in the morning all snacking at night is</p>
<p>one of the worst thing I could possibly</p>
<p>do to your body yeah I bet your viewers</p>
<p>would like to know why because when</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re getting when you&rsquo;re consuming</p>
<p>calories you&rsquo;re converting those</p>
<p>calories to energy and the process the</p>
<p>energy the biochemical metabolism that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>required to do that generates reactive</p>
<p>oxygen species and they tend to back up</p>
<p>and you expansion expand the production</p>
<p>of those oxidative stress errs when you</p>
<p>eat when you&rsquo;re not using the energy and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s exactly what you do when you eat</p>
<p>before you go to bed because your energy</p>
<p>consumption drops dramatically when</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re sleeping there&rsquo;s no need to have</p>
<p>extra energy so it&rsquo;s just you&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>damaging your body when you do that so</p>
<p>one of the most important principles</p>
<p>does not eat for three hours before</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re asleep so let&rsquo;s just clarify that</p>
<p>for those people when you talk about</p>
<p>Ross or reaction auctioning species in</p>
<p>relationship to what you said just make</p>
<p>it really simple like what how could</p>
<p>someone really get that what does that</p>
<p>mean well there is a process that occurs</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re creating energy and it</p>
<p>usually occurs in our mitochondria those</p>
<p>are these little organelles and our</p>
<p>cells that are considered to be the</p>
<p>energy producers and they create ATP and</p>
<p>that process is has a leaky production</p>
<p>of these electrons that go out and they</p>
<p>cause free Router they cause reactive</p>
<p>oxygen species which are responsible</p>
<p>producing free radicals which can create</p>
<p>cellular damage and proteins DNA cell</p>
<p>membranes okay so net and it&rsquo;s the many</p>
<p>people have heard that and they think</p>
<p>free radicals are bad but actually the</p>
<p>truth is that you need a certain level</p>
<p>of them to operate and be healthy there</p>
<p>are important biological signaling</p>
<p>molecules so that if you</p>
<p>indiscriminately suppress them with</p>
<p>excessive antioxidants that could</p>
<p>actually cause problems but the key here</p>
<p>is not to take external exogenous</p>
<p>supplementation&rsquo;s but to live</p>
<p>it the production and one of the ways</p>
<p>you can do that is by not exposing</p>
<p>yourself to ionizing radiation there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>no dispute here&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s non-controversial</p>
<p>the last thing you want to do is stand</p>
<p>in front of an x-ray or a cat scan on a</p>
<p>regular basis because you&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>die prematurely or handle radioactive</p>
<p>material we know that and if we have</p>
<p>time later on we&rsquo;ll talk about the non</p>
<p>innovative radiation but similarly you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t want to expose yourself to</p>
<p>excessive oxidative stress errs by</p>
<p>eating at the wrong time because it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>trying to cause similar damage okay so</p>
<p>now when you talk about I mean like just</p>
<p>eating in general or certain things will</p>
<p>create more oxygen stress both actually</p>
<p>timing is probably the crucial one but</p>
<p>certainly eating the wrong foods things</p>
<p>like trans fats or industrially</p>
<p>processed vegetable oils you know are</p>
<p>really pernicious to your health and and</p>
<p>the trans fats are probably in the</p>
<p>industrial process oils they&rsquo;re worse</p>
<p>than sugar in my view because the sugar</p>
<p>will create these this pulse of</p>
<p>oxidative stress but then it&rsquo;s gone it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t do any long-term damage from</p>
<p>that perspective but these industrial</p>
<p>oils get embed yourself membranes they</p>
<p>stick around for a long time and they</p>
<p>really plug up your system and make it</p>
<p>difficult to stay healthy so when you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t eat when you&rsquo;re fasting what</p>
<p>happens with these do you just have less</p>
<p>free radical damage</p>
<p>well you&rsquo;re not well because you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>eating at the right time you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>creating excessive free radicals but</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s a lot of other magic</p>
<p>that occurs metabolic magic when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not eating because you&rsquo;re replicating</p>
<p>what our ancestors did they went</p>
<p>regularly through times of not eating</p>
<p>and they never had access to a</p>
<p>refrigerator 24/7 where they can eat</p>
<p>like most of our population does I said</p>
<p>90% people eat more than 12 hours a day</p>
<p>I mean that&rsquo;s essentially every waking</p>
<p>hour they&rsquo;re eating yes crazy when would</p>
<p>they get up to the moment they go to bed</p>
<p>and that is a prescription for metabolic</p>
<p>disaster so that was one that was one</p>
<p>aspect and the other is that I&rsquo;m well I</p>
<p>forgot what they did your question was</p>
<p>there well just just the relationship to</p>
<p>when you when you don&rsquo;t eat I think</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a fasting elicit some genetic</p>
<p>things what so that what happens</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not eating is that you will</p>
<p>actually stimulate some very important</p>
<p>metabolic about a process called autopsy</p>
<p>which is from the Greek word to self eat</p>
<p>and that is a clean up process that you</p>
<p>have the cellular debris these</p>
<p>organelles these cells that clog up your</p>
<p>system that essentially are removed when</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not eating because your system</p>
<p>shuts down it has clean and repair and</p>
<p>then your digestive system is given a</p>
<p>chance to rest to so that you are less</p>
<p>likely to have leaky gut and absorb</p>
<p>these large molecules from your food</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re eating into your system and</p>
<p>cause autoimmune problems so it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>really an important process that we were</p>
<p>designed to follow if we want to stay</p>
<p>healthy oh yeah you know I was before I</p>
<p>was a Carroll I was a x-ray tech and I</p>
<p>did x-rays in nursing homes that would</p>
<p>portable x-rays said go out there and I</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t have time to you know properly</p>
<p>bring a shield I would take x-rays with</p>
<p>this little unit like from one foot away</p>
<p>and no shield like I know I was filled</p>
<p>with radiation so that&rsquo;s just something</p>
<p>that in the back of my mind that&rsquo;s why</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m kind of like really you can be</p>
<p>filled with glyphosate from eating</p>
<p>non-gmo foods but you can&rsquo;t be filled</p>
<p>with radiation you&rsquo;re exposed to and</p>
<p>then it causes damages you have to deal</p>
<p>with unfortunately there are some</p>
<p>strategies because the ionizing</p>
<p>radiation your is exposed to as an x-ray</p>
<p>tech is very similar to the radiation</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re exposed to flying at 35,000 feet</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know about you but I&rsquo;m pretty</p>
<p>much on an airplane at least once a</p>
<p>month and there are some really</p>
<p>effective strategies in would you like</p>
<p>to know one of the simplest and least</p>
<p>expensive strategy to protect it to do</p>
<p>this basic but when you&rsquo;re flying does</p>
<p>this have to do with fasting it has to</p>
<p>do with fasting because you up regularly</p>
<p>you the other interesting thing when you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t eat food is that you increase the</p>
<p>levels of one of the most important</p>
<p>coenzymes in your body which is nad</p>
<p>nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide and</p>
<p>that is really the fuel for an enzyme</p>
<p>that repairs the DNA damage response or</p>
<p>helps repair the damage and it&rsquo;s called</p>
<p>poly poly adp-ribose polymerase or par</p>
<p>for short and it&rsquo;s so when you&rsquo;re the</p>
<p>the radiation comes in damages the DNA</p>
<p>this PARP can facilitate the repair but</p>
<p>this part requires nad so when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>fasting you&rsquo;re going to increase your</p>
<p>entity levels now there&rsquo;s other ways you</p>
<p>can do that you can take exogenous</p>
<p>ketones which is very expensive it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to be about 25 to 40 dollars a</p>
<p>dose depending on how much ketones</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re taking and you know it&rsquo;s in a</p>
<p>work we&rsquo;re presenting in fact they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>studying this exogenous ketones with the</p>
<p>NASA is for the astronauts to mitigate</p>
<p>ionizing radiation damage but you can</p>
<p>just do it by not eating and you know</p>
<p>that gets into my next book which is</p>
<p>keto fast that comes out in May which</p>
<p>talks about the benefits of partial</p>
<p>fasting as opposed to long-term</p>
<p>multi-day water fasting which is what I</p>
<p>was thinking I was going to promote</p>
<p>because initially I liked this time last</p>
<p>year I thought five-day water fest was</p>
<p>the best metabolic intervention I&rsquo;d ever</p>
<p>seen in my entire political career and</p>
<p>it still is powerful but I think in the</p>
<p>21st century it&rsquo;s not a wise solution</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the conclusion I reach after</p>
<p>studying this very carefully now I</p>
<p>recommend a partial fast which I</p>
<p>described in keto fast like intermittent</p>
<p>fasting I&rsquo;m sorry intermittent fasting</p>
<p>no it&rsquo;s different intermittent fasting</p>
<p>let me let me describe a keto kisses</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a bit confusing</p>
<p>intermittent fasting is the base so that</p>
<p>you do this for you know eat within a 6</p>
<p>to 8 hour window for at least a month</p>
<p>and then your metabolically flexible and</p>
<p>upon that platform you add another level</p>
<p>of fasting which is you would your first</p>
<p>meal instead of having to whatever 2,000</p>
<p>3,000 4,000 calories a day that you</p>
<p>normally eat your first meal of the day</p>
<p>after fasting for 18 hours would be</p>
<p>anywhere from 300 to 600 calories maybe</p>
<p>800 if you&rsquo;re a really big muscle</p>
<p>builder so you just have that one meal</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s the only thing you eat that</p>
<p>and then for 24 hours you don&rsquo;t need</p>
<p>anything else</p>
<p>so for 42 hours you&rsquo;re only having</p>
<p>anywhere from 300 to 500 calories that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it so that&rsquo;s the partial fast which will</p>
<p>not give you the identical benefits of a</p>
<p>5 day water fast but will</p>
<p>give you a large percentage of them</p>
<p>probably 80 to 90% of the benefits which</p>
<p>virtually no the downside which involves</p>
<p>liberation of these toxins from your fat</p>
<p>cells and being unable to effectively</p>
<p>process and eliminate them from your</p>
<p>body causing further damage so so so</p>
<p>clarify that so we&rsquo;re talking about a</p>
<p>pattern of eating and not eating um and</p>
<p>you said you know you have this certain</p>
<p>intimate of fasting and then</p>
<p>periodically you do that&rsquo;s right that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the key it&rsquo;s not something you do every</p>
<p>day right just like exercise if you do</p>
<p>extras intense exercise every day you</p>
<p>will kill yourself prematurely you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>digging a hole as you can&rsquo;t get out of</p>
<p>this and fasting or partial fasting is</p>
<p>very similar exercising that is it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>pulse it definitely in some ways weakens</p>
<p>your body but it makes it stronger when</p>
<p>you get out of it on the other side so</p>
<p>you only want to do this like once or if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re if you&rsquo;re metabolically deranged</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re damaged then I could say your</p>
<p>weight a hundred pounds overweight they</p>
<p>may want to do it twice a week but for</p>
<p>healthy people I think once a week is</p>
<p>enough maybe even a little bit less than</p>
<p>that but I try</p>
<p>depending on my schedule when I gain</p>
<p>enough weight I&rsquo;ll partial fast like I</p>
<p>partial fasted Sunday and so that we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>reporting this on a Thursday so and I</p>
<p>lost six pounds and I regained the six</p>
<p>pounds and so then when I get to that</p>
<p>threshold of weight then I then I can</p>
<p>know I can partial fast I&rsquo;m gonna lose</p>
<p>five or six pounds my partial fast this</p>
<p>is the way it works it&rsquo;s interesting</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>something that I&rsquo;ve I&rsquo;m also</p>
<p>experimenting on right now as well when</p>
<p>it you know because you think about it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a little bit like muscle confusion if</p>
<p>you training over time decreases your</p>
<p>gains because your body adapts to it so</p>
<p>you have to constantly switch it up</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s and it probably goes within</p>
<p>a minute faster I mean you take a look</p>
<p>at how our bodies were designed way back</p>
<p>it wasn&rsquo;t such a regular thing it was</p>
<p>like one day we&rsquo;re eating two days we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not you know right right I mean we see</p>
<p>this in nature all time I&rsquo;m watching</p>
<p>this brilliant planet Earth 2 on BBC</p>
<p>documentary X and it&rsquo;s just so</p>
<p>fascinating to watch the animals</p>
<p>a charlie I mean Laden don&rsquo;t make it</p>
<p>they just don&rsquo;t get the food on their</p>
<p>dead but I mean that food supply is not</p>
<p>guaranteed on a regular basis it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>intermittent yeah my wife we&rsquo;re now just</p>
<p>watching that last night - with the</p>
<p>little starfish and they&rsquo;re there like I</p>
<p>mean there&rsquo;s the tides coming and I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>like this is incredible with this I just</p>
<p>as much planet Earth oh okay which is I</p>
<p>liked even I mean I like getting better</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s terrestrial animals and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s just so fascinating these</p>
<p>wild wild stuff I was gonna I wanted to</p>
<p>ask about an interesting phenomena that</p>
<p>occurs and you touched on it when you</p>
<p>fast there&rsquo;s a your body basically</p>
<p>resists stress it protects you I guess</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a I guess it&rsquo;s the term is it</p>
<p>resists oxidative stress it actually</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not like an emergent like like</p>
<p>Julie Michael she&rsquo;s saying oh yeah</p>
<p>ketosis fasting it&rsquo;s an emergency state</p>
<p>like actually it&rsquo;s not necessarily</p>
<p>stressful it&rsquo;s gonna your body&rsquo;s gonna</p>
<p>actually protect you against oxidative</p>
<p>damage and that is a very interesting</p>
<p>phenomena because you would think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just the opposite oh I&rsquo;m gonna starve</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m stressed out I&rsquo;m not gonna eat she</p>
<p>hasn&rsquo;t she probably doesn&rsquo;t even know</p>
<p>what a ketone is No so for your and many</p>
<p>of your here&rsquo;s may not either so it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>you know we hear all the time but what</p>
<p>the hell is a ketone you know it is a</p>
<p>simply put it&rsquo;s a very small chain it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>usually two three or four carbon chain</p>
<p>fat that&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s so short</p>
<p>its water soluble and is consensually</p>
<p>penetrate almost every cell in your body</p>
<p>can easily pass the blood-brain barrier</p>
<p>and supply your brain with fuel that</p>
<p>makes it mentally alert and sharp yeah</p>
<p>interesting yeah I you know just one</p>
<p>side out on that just because um what I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t understand about and the reason I</p>
<p>bring this up just because it was a hot</p>
<p>topic and I wanted for those of you that</p>
<p>are listening you know there&rsquo;s a dr. axe</p>
<p>is one of his companies called ancient</p>
<p>nutrition I think and cheese she&rsquo;s one</p>
<p>of the investors and I&rsquo;m just surprising</p>
<p>because why would you bash keto if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re investing in a company</p>
<p>has all these keto products so it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s weird I don&rsquo;t understand it</p>
<p>so inconsistent yeah you mentioned about</p>
<p>radiation</p>
<p>what about EMF I just wanna a lot of</p>
<p>people don&rsquo;t know what that is I know</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re interested in it you you</p>
<p>know a lot about it just give us some</p>
<p>data on that well there we talked about</p>
<p>there for hours essentially the reason</p>
<p>why there&rsquo;s a lot of confusion out it</p>
<p>relates to the reason why there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>confusion about conventional medicine</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s very powerful</p>
<p>corporations and with respect to</p>
<p>medicine that&rsquo;s primarily the drug</p>
<p>companies that can go out and influence</p>
<p>the public and in fact there was an</p>
<p>article published two weeks ago in JAMA</p>
<p>that reviewed medical marketing and a</p>
<p>night in 1997 they spent 2 billion</p>
<p>dollars on direct to consumer</p>
<p>advertising direct to consumer every</p>
<p>time this is what you see on TV that was</p>
<p>in 1997 ok to confuse people now</p>
<p>remember the United States is only one</p>
<p>of two countries in the world where this</p>
<p>is legal you can&rsquo;t do it in any almost</p>
<p>any other country in the world so what</p>
<p>do you think they spent 2016 what did it</p>
<p>go up to literally 20 years later I have</p>
<p>no idea 10 billion dollars what 10</p>
<p>billion dollars was spent direct to</p>
<p>consumer advertising okay that sounds</p>
<p>like a lot right what did they spend in</p>
<p>1997 for for manipulating deceiving and</p>
<p>confusing positions how much 16 billion</p>
<p>Woods thousand 16 and went up to 30</p>
<p>billion dollars oh no you know and this</p>
<p>is so that sounds like a lot of money it</p>
<p>is and the reason I went on this tangent</p>
<p>is that most of your viewers are</p>
<p>familiar with the process of</p>
<p>manipulation and deception and fraud</p>
<p>that occurs in medicine otherwise they</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t be watching your channel</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t be watching me so the where</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not familiar with they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>familiar with is the EMF of component</p>
<p>and you need to understand that the</p>
<p>level of</p>
<p>corporate influence is exponentially</p>
<p>higher when it comes to the</p>
<p>telecommunications industry they dwarf</p>
<p>the pharmaceutical industry they have</p>
<p>been able to centrally manipulate the</p>
<p>federal regulatory agencies including</p>
<p>the FTC the FDA the EPA that this is</p>
<p>safe</p>
<p>they these guys are bought and sold I</p>
<p>mean the former head of the FTC was the</p>
<p>head of the telecommunications lobbying</p>
<p>industry it&rsquo;s like this is icky the fox</p>
<p>guarding the hen house Wow so and and we</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have to there&rsquo;s a great there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s on Netflix it&rsquo;s on</p>
<p>Amazon Prime you have to pay for I think</p>
<p>is merchants of doubt&rsquo; which doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>brilliant expose on the the corporate</p>
<p>influence a lot of these policies and</p>
<p>they did they focused a lot on tobacco</p>
<p>industry and yeah there&rsquo;s also a book if</p>
<p>you prefer reading which preceded the</p>
<p>movie or the documentary but the purpose</p>
<p>of this is to know to understand that</p>
<p>the CDC and the FDA believes if DEA at</p>
<p>the FDA and CDC both came out Surgeon</p>
<p>General and denounced smoking yet the</p>
<p>tobacco industry was able to convince</p>
<p>the public and created enough doubt that</p>
<p>they were able to delay the final</p>
<p>acknowledgment in the day of the dangers</p>
<p>of smoking for three decades 30 years</p>
<p>now again tobacco industry is peanuts</p>
<p>compared to telex telecommunications and</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t and and they had the federal</p>
<p>regulatory agencies saying that it was</p>
<p>harmful we don&rsquo;t have that with EMF so</p>
<p>understand the very basic protective</p>
<p>mechanisms that are the government is</p>
<p>supposed to have don&rsquo;t work when it</p>
<p>comes email if they just don&rsquo;t work so</p>
<p>that you have to understand any of the</p>
<p>public health authorities that what</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to see in the media which</p>
<p>is bought and sold for by the industry</p>
<p>is going to confuse the heck out of you</p>
<p>but yet there are like the bio</p>
<p>initiative report published</p>
<p>years ago and it&rsquo;s updated annually has</p>
<p>thousands and thousands and thousands of</p>
<p>studies documenting clearly in</p>
<p>peer-reviewed published journals the</p>
<p>science that that that that</p>
<p>authentically validates the danger of</p>
<p>these exposures you talk about EMF EMF</p>
<p>yes stuff that stuff yeah so you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>holding a cell phone I&rsquo;m assuming that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an airplane mode good question but</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s see without it&rsquo;s no it&rsquo;s not an</p>
<p>airline or airplane mode yeah</p>
<p>okay so the airplane mode okay all right</p>
<p>well you that&rsquo;s good and even dr. bird</p>
<p>in airplane mode and hopefully I will be</p>
<p>able to convince him of the danger from</p>
<p>my perspective unless you have a medical</p>
<p>emergency or something that&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>just shockingly critical you should</p>
<p>never have your phone on your body</p>
<p>unless it&rsquo;s an airplane mode and this is</p>
<p>even validated by the instructions that</p>
<p>come with each and every phone it needs</p>
<p>to be at least six to eight millimeters</p>
<p>away from your body okay so first of all</p>
<p>why why should we keep it an airplane</p>
<p>mode well because that will lower</p>
<p>radically by orders of magnitude the</p>
<p>radiation that comes out from there</p>
<p>won&rsquo;t eliminate it but it almost does so</p>
<p>basically I have to turn it on right now</p>
<p>right era airplane mode yeah yeah turn</p>
<p>it on right and then you can put it on</p>
<p>then do funny about you sure damage it I</p>
<p>mean you know you know Senator McCain</p>
<p>died recently right yeah glioblastoma</p>
<p>that was from a cell phone he also got a</p>
<p>parotid tumors I exactly what where he</p>
<p>held a cell phone Wow</p>
<p>I mean it doesn&rsquo;t discriminate against</p>
<p>you know who you know who you are what</p>
<p>type of political office you hold or how</p>
<p>much money you have it&rsquo;s gonna hit you</p>
<p>either way so so this this information</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re saying it&rsquo;s not readily available</p>
<p>I mean it&rsquo;s like this probably been</p>
<p>since lightly suppressed it&rsquo;s readily</p>
<p>available but there&rsquo;s just like that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>why the book merchants of doubt&rsquo; is so</p>
<p>good because it helps you understand the</p>
<p>strategies that the court</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s corporations used and it wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>just tobacco it&rsquo;s asbestos and climate</p>
<p>change global warming it&rsquo;s this whole</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lynnium about six different</p>
<p>areas that they discussed it&rsquo;s the same</p>
<p>down strategy every time Wow</p>
<p>telecommunications industry is still</p>
<p>they they hire the same PR agencies that</p>
<p>tobacco did interesting you know so you</p>
<p>just understand it you know because</p>
<p>people are going to think I&rsquo;m way out</p>
<p>there and I&rsquo;m confused and I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>what the heck I&rsquo;m talking about but once</p>
<p>you understand the foundational</p>
<p>realities of what was that</p>
<p>seeking to confuse you then you then you</p>
<p>can realize well maybe there is</p>
<p>something more listen you feel easily</p>
<p>validate this you can do this yourself</p>
<p>problem is most of us don&rsquo;t have the</p>
<p>time right you know I&rsquo;m in a position in</p>
<p>life where I delegate been able to</p>
<p>delegate almost every non-essential</p>
<p>thing in my life out and I just have</p>
<p>loads of time where I can research and</p>
<p>stuff and most people don&rsquo;t have that</p>
<p>luxury so right you know and I can read</p>
<p>it and compile and put it together and</p>
<p>put in a book that you can read and</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s other people who do that too I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>not the only one certainly but you know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s there and you can independently</p>
<p>assess it and figure it out yourself</p>
<p>fascinating you know I I&rsquo;m very very</p>
<p>very sensitive to this phone I can&rsquo;t I</p>
<p>hate talking the phone I I never ever</p>
<p>hold it up to my ear however the and I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know a tremendous amount amount</p>
<p>EMF but the way I learned about it is I</p>
<p>used to do seminars and all the</p>
<p>governmental agencies in Washington DC</p>
<p>and I went into the an agency the</p>
<p>National Science</p>
<p>&rsquo;national Science Institute I go in</p>
<p>there to do a seminar and this guy came</p>
<p>up to me he was one of the scientists</p>
<p>and he he says what&rsquo;s your thoughts on</p>
<p>EMF and at that time I didn&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>have any data and he started to educate</p>
<p>me from he was doing research at that</p>
<p>institution on EMF and telling me yeah</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s it can create tumors it creates</p>
<p>this and I just was a sudden awareness</p>
<p>of like I had no idea and if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>studying this you know there&rsquo;s must be</p>
<p>something to it</p>
<p>yeah there is a lot to it and the we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not going to I said we wouldn&rsquo;t need two</p>
<p>to three hours to cover this copper</p>
<p>sensibly and I could easily do that</p>
<p>without notes but we don&rsquo;t have the time</p>
<p>to do that now so for those who are</p>
<p>interested in this simple book that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>easy to read and gives you a lot of</p>
<p>pretzel strategies until mine comes out</p>
<p>in 2020 would be the non tin foil guide</p>
<p>to EMF a Nicholas pin alt and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>available on Amazon so that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>good one to say because it goes with</p>
<p>basically it&rsquo;s not for the the research</p>
<p>savvy scientist or clinician who wants</p>
<p>the details because this is written for</p>
<p>the consumer which is you know really</p>
<p>the target of most people watching this</p>
<p>so that that&rsquo;s a strategy for sure and</p>
<p>the other component to understand we</p>
<p>talked about nad before now there&rsquo;s if</p>
<p>for those of you who are a little more</p>
<p>science oriented there&rsquo;s an incredible</p>
<p>research paper written twelve years ago</p>
<p>now is written 2007 by Paul patcher PA</p>
<p>CH ER and it&rsquo;s called parry oxy nitrite</p>
<p>PE ro X y ni t RI t parallaxing nitrite</p>
<p>in health and disease and it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>literally a hundred and forty page paper</p>
<p>it is a book it is a book and it has</p>
<p>1,400 references</p>
<p>it is literally I read hundreds and</p>
<p>hundreds and hundreds of thousands of</p>
<p>studies every year and this is one of</p>
<p>the best written papers I&rsquo;ve ever read</p>
<p>in my life is just unbelievable and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>free there&rsquo;s no charge for it love you</p>
<p>know half the journal articles you got</p>
<p>to pay $30 $40 to get this write free go</p>
<p>online on google type in what I said</p>
<p>line I gave you a title and you&rsquo;ll get</p>
<p>get this paper and he helps you</p>
<p>understand this is such a foundational</p>
<p>critical paper it really is a foundation</p>
<p>for the next three books I&rsquo;m writing is</p>
<p>to understand we talked about oxidative</p>
<p>stress and we took then most people</p>
<p>think our OS reactive oxygen species but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not just our OS it&rsquo;s our NS</p>
<p>reactive nitrogen species and the most</p>
<p>toxic probably the most toxic species is</p>
<p>Perry oxy nitrates so what the heck is</p>
<p>it well this is what happened this is so</p>
<p>just understand it is a thing that you</p>
<p>you and I were not taught in school and</p>
<p>I would say almost all medical students</p>
<p>today are not taught in school okay</p>
<p>because this is biology there&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>figured out in last 10 years ago maybe</p>
<p>15 years so and then I learned about if</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Martin Paul who should my view</p>
<p>should get him a Nobel Prize for this</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a little too deep for most people</p>
<p>watching but he does MPA ll Martin Pau</p>
<p>pal-14 and EMF on YouTube and get he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>got dozens of hour or longer lectures</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll go into the deep science of it and</p>
<p>far more detail than I had time to do</p>
<p>now but he told me about Paris I mean he</p>
<p>talks about Paris tonight reelection and</p>
<p>he seems like everyone knows about it</p>
<p>but no one knows about it that&rsquo;s why</p>
<p>this paper I mentioned it&rsquo;s so critical</p>
<p>because it help you understand it</p>
<p>because this is a foundation and the</p>
<p>problem is when you&rsquo;re exposed to EMF</p>
<p>like you are when your phone wasn&rsquo;t in</p>
<p>airplane mode or almost everyone</p>
<p>watching is because they are at home</p>
<p>where the Wi-Fi is on and believe me if</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t understand this you need to</p>
<p>know that having a Wi-Fi modem in your</p>
<p>home on is like having a cell phone</p>
<p>tower in your house yeah that is a same</p>
<p>thing that&rsquo;s why when I&rsquo;m talking to you</p>
<p>from my home studio and I do not have</p>
<p>any Wi-Fi in here I have a very safe</p>
<p>signal I&rsquo;m in the green zone with</p>
<p>respect to I&rsquo;m less than point zero 1</p>
<p>volts per meter of radio frequency</p>
<p>exposures so that&rsquo;s great but almost</p>
<p>everyone is watching this on Wi-Fi and</p>
<p>they got their phone on they&rsquo;re getting</p>
<p>blasted so what is happening what is</p>
<p>happening when you do that these radio</p>
<p>frequency signals typically in the</p>
<p>gigahertz range but even at lower</p>
<p>frequencies will go and stimulate the</p>
<p>voltage-gated calcium channels of V</p>
<p>GCC&rsquo;s they&rsquo;re embedded in all the cell</p>
<p>membranes the neurological tissue like</p>
<p>the brain and the conduction pathways in</p>
<p>your heart at the highest densities so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why there&rsquo;s so many people now</p>
<p>with brain tumors and cardiac</p>
<p>arrhythmias afib a flutter you know and</p>
<p>if you know anyone who has these</p>
<p>conditions you&rsquo;ve got to tell them be</p>
<p>enough because that&rsquo;s probably that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>good likelihood that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s causing it</p>
<p>so anyway these voltage-gated calcium</p>
<p>channels get activated and it&rsquo;s just a</p>
<p>gate right it&rsquo;s just like a gate you</p>
<p>have on your front yard when you open it</p>
<p>up things come in so there</p>
<p>a calcium gauge so the calcium floods</p>
<p>and calcium is really high outside the</p>
<p>cell orders a magnetized on the inside</p>
<p>and which opens up the calcium flows in</p>
<p>the cell so what happens when now</p>
<p>calcium flies into the cell it act it it</p>
<p>does two primary things is a signal and</p>
<p>it will causes more nitric oxide and</p>
<p>superoxide to form and these are very</p>
<p>reactive molecules they get within a</p>
<p>hair breadth of each other a hair growth</p>
<p>of a hair growth of each other and they</p>
<p>form peri oxy nitrite why is this so</p>
<p>dangerous why is it so much because the</p>
<p>most dangerous ro s is hydroxyl free</p>
<p>radical hydroxyl free radicals and I</p>
<p>know many people have heard of this</p>
<p>think what they don&rsquo;t know about</p>
<p>hydroxyl free radical is his only last</p>
<p>one billionth of one second much very</p>
<p>short-lived it hardly goes anywhere so</p>
<p>most of the art most of the hydroxyl</p>
<p>radical is actually created in energy</p>
<p>generation in mitochondria so and when</p>
<p>it only lasts of billions of a second it</p>
<p>can only travel for the distance of a</p>
<p>protein or so so essentially that means</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t escape the mitochondria and</p>
<p>cousin go to the cytoplasm it doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>travel into the nucleus but peri AXI</p>
<p>nitrite not only is it not just the</p>
<p>mitochondria it&rsquo;s hitting it all the</p>
<p>cells but the entire cell is going in</p>
<p>but but it lasts nine billion times</p>
<p>longer and hydroxyl free radical so I</p>
<p>usually travel out of my Kandra into it</p>
<p>can go out of the cell back in the cell</p>
<p>into the nucleus all over a cause is</p>
<p>damaged so it&rsquo;s not as a aggressively</p>
<p>voracious as hydroxyl but it lasts nine</p>
<p>billion times longer so it&rsquo;s 99 billion</p>
<p>times more potent from that perspective</p>
<p>now the hydroxyl radical has two needs</p>
<p>either iron or copper to be reactive</p>
<p>right now that&rsquo;s just catalyzed it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>called the fencin reaction that the</p>
<p>catalyzes that reaction what does this</p>
<p>created it&rsquo;s created so the Fen</p>
<p>catalyzes that so if that&rsquo;s another</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s another interesting point that</p>
<p>most clinicians are ignorant of</p>
<p>essentially that&rsquo;s the best term that I</p>
<p>would use to describe the dead excess</p>
<p>iron your body which almost all your</p>
<p>adult males watching this and any</p>
<p>postmenopausal women is a problem so</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got to measure your iron levels</p>
<p>and the best way to do that it&rsquo;s fair</p>
<p>and ideally should be between 20 and</p>
<p>simple thing that&rsquo;ll radically lower</p>
<p>your risk of heart disease and cancer</p>
<p>and dementia that&rsquo;s well documented</p>
<p>right so how do we how do we get these</p>
<p>this this new radical thing well how do</p>
<p>is it from the EMF or what what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>creating it no no the primary that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>great question the primary catalyst for</p>
<p>that is this excessive disposer to EMF</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the molecular necklace he I knew</p>
<p>about EMS for two decades and probably</p>
<p>you knew about him to take so treat it</p>
<p>and you know we&rsquo;re told by the people</p>
<p>who should know that it&rsquo;s dangerous and</p>
<p>should but it&rsquo;s so darn convenient that</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t want to believe it right right</p>
<p>and you know and and these merchants of</p>
<p>doubt are creating doubt they&rsquo;re create</p>
<p>all these studies to say well it does it</p>
<p>you know so you&rsquo;re using data</p>
<p>justification to perpetuate your</p>
<p>ignorance or lack not ignorance but lack</p>
<p>of action to effectively mitigate your</p>
<p>exposure to this so I was like that up</p>
<p>until a few years ago and a clean heart</p>
<p>catalyze my interest in this and they</p>
<p>started studying and Paul is really the</p>
<p>genius in this whole area who&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>sure I think should get a Nobel Prize</p>
<p>but what so once you once you understand</p>
<p>the mechanism that there&rsquo;s actually hard</p>
<p>science behind this then you start to</p>
<p>believe it Wow okay so it&rsquo;s basically</p>
<p>creating this influx of calcium in the</p>
<p>cell what what are some of the</p>
<p>consequences other than you know signal</p>
<p>signaling problems</p>
<p>brain tumors there many that&rsquo;s why the</p>
<p>title of my book the tentative title for</p>
<p>2020 is EMF the extinction event yeah</p>
<p>because your your what is it I already</p>
<p>mentioned earlier it&rsquo;s going to hit the</p>
<p>heart so you&rsquo;ll have arrhythmias but on</p>
<p>the beginning and end of the spectrum</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s certainly not the only variable but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an important variable to contribute</p>
<p>to the the occurrence of autism in</p>
<p>autism even by conservative measures the</p>
<p>last measurement that by the government</p>
<p>by the government when I was in med</p>
<p>school when I started practicing in 85</p>
<p>wanted I didn&rsquo;t see any autistic</p>
<p>patients because there was one in 10,000</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re autistic faces I have 10,000</p>
<p>patients okay I&rsquo;ve seen tens of</p>
<p>thousands of patient business but I</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t have 10,000 patients so I never</p>
<p>saw an autistic patient and tell us the</p>
<p>instance start increase now today they</p>
<p>admit conservative it is probably much</p>
<p>higher this is one in 40 one in 41 40</p>
<p>Wow</p>
<p>so from one in ten thousand one and</p>
<p>forty so that&rsquo;s one consequence</p>
<p>glyphosate is another issue</p>
<p>vaccines are another issue but probably</p>
<p>collecting they are the two biggest so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s one so you&rsquo;ve got you know if a</p>
<p>trial with autism requires care givers</p>
<p>otherwise they&rsquo;re gonna die they just</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t take care of themselves so you</p>
<p>have an enormous amount of resources</p>
<p>being invested in the taking care of the</p>
<p>autistic ators and then the other in</p>
<p>this spectrum you&rsquo;ve got Alzheimer&rsquo;s</p>
<p>which we have a tsunami an epidemic of</p>
<p>Alzheimer&rsquo;s which is clearly EMF is</p>
<p>contributing to this Wow so you know</p>
<p>both of those are increasing</p>
<p>exponentially so if you&rsquo;ve got you know</p>
<p>half the population demented in the</p>
<p>other half I mean we&rsquo;re going to one in</p>
<p>two autistic birds that care for</p>
<p>themselves how can the society survive</p>
<p>the only segments or remnants of the sub</p>
<p>population of those survivor that people</p>
<p>aren&rsquo;t exposed to have these types of</p>
<p>exposures because they&rsquo;re you can&rsquo;t it</p>
<p>just it&rsquo;ll collapse</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just destined to collapse unless</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some changes incorrect</p>
<p>what now as someone ages there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>definitely this huge problem and I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know if this is related with calcium</p>
<p>calcium deposits you have arthritis you</p>
<p>have calcium yeah well there&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>variables for that it&rsquo;s like a chronic</p>
<p>inflammation and right and in vitamin k2</p>
<p>is another important because that sucks</p>
<p>the calcium from the lining of the blood</p>
<p>vessels back into the bones where it</p>
<p>belongs so and it you know in the</p>
<p>hormonal component so it&rsquo;s not just a</p>
<p>simple I mean you shouldn&rsquo;t be taking</p>
<p>calcium supplements for the most part</p>
<p>but you should but you know museum is</p>
<p>far more important but you know excess</p>
<p>calcium could be in there but it but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not it&rsquo;s more of a symptom that it</p>
<p>caused yeah exactly</p>
<p>okay so as far as the viewers right now</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;re kind of probably gonna go</p>
<p>alright you opened a can of worms at</p>
<p>least need to know something about</p>
<p>because they all have cell phones</p>
<p>only put in airplane mode if it&rsquo;s gonna</p>
<p>be in your body what it what about the</p>
<p>earphones that earbuds see they have</p>
<p>different kinds what yeah yeah well</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll talk about that but let me just</p>
<p>finish this airplane mode okay how often</p>
<p>do you charge your phone every day at</p>
<p>night how often do you think I charge my</p>
<p>phone I have no idea yes when it runs</p>
<p>out yeah well yeah I guess a phone</p>
<p>depending if it&rsquo;s on I guess it lasts</p>
<p>what every two days every day once once</p>
<p>every seven to ten days what yeah that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>how often I charge my phone</p>
<p>what yeah how does it last that long I</p>
<p>have a super battery no cuz it&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>airplane mode that you&rsquo;re putting into</p>
<p>the battery is creating radio</p>
<p>frequencies which are exposing you your</p>
<p>body and your family to these this</p>
<p>energy interesting so acid mine is mine</p>
<p>is on occasionally I mean but even if</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t you ever turn it on it&rsquo;s still</p>
<p>gonna vary probably only last maybe two</p>
<p>weeks before it goes dead so so you</p>
<p>basically extend your battery life when</p>
<p>you it&rsquo;s in yeah exponentially alright</p>
<p>so then your other question was well</p>
<p>what do you do you know how do you</p>
<p>protect yourself well the first step is</p>
<p>airplane mode is almost all the time and</p>
<p>use a landline you can easily use a</p>
<p>landline by using your computer there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>voice phones on your computer which is</p>
<p>what I do all the time people cannot</p>
<p>caught they know I I don&rsquo;t text I just</p>
<p>do not use my cell phone</p>
<p>I mean I&rsquo;ll use text occasionally but I</p>
<p>mean I get more the amount of texting I</p>
<p>do today in a year is equal to most</p>
<p>people&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re doing today</p>
<p>essentially you know I do it to over and</p>
<p>catch an uber or something and it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>a text but that&rsquo;s a using my cell phone</p>
<p>but anyway so what can you do if when</p>
<p>you do use it make sure it&rsquo;s far from</p>
<p>your body so if you&rsquo;re going to hold it</p>
<p>you speaker from them you know that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>lot easier more community because you</p>
<p>all we have speaker always have the</p>
<p>speakerphone actually you never know not</p>
<p>necessarily going to have your headphone</p>
<p>Asst yes inconvenient it&rsquo;s a hassle so</p>
<p>most of them you just go to</p>
<p>quite place you know I mean you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>want to annoy or disturb others so like</p>
<p>if I&rsquo;m in an airplane lounge and the</p>
<p>only that&rsquo;s the only phone I have I&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>use mice but a whole far from you and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll have it on the speaker mode I mean</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re still hurting your hand but at</p>
<p>least it&rsquo;s a far away from them what</p>
<p>really counts because the your friend is</p>
<p>distant so the further away from your</p>
<p>body it is the better and you have to</p>
<p>know though and I with with the</p>
<p>equipment the and the best meter to get</p>
<p>for remittitur and radio frequencies for</p>
<p>everyone is called the acoustic comm -</p>
<p>acoustic just like it sounds with an om</p>
<p>and a - and get that out it&rsquo;s very hard</p>
<p>to find though because it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s so it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a very obscure website it&rsquo;s called</p>
<p>Amazon $150 and I actually the battery</p>
<p>lock I think I&rsquo;ve had mine for two years</p>
<p>I have been change the battery but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an analog signal so you can</p>
<p>actually it has an acoustic sound so you</p>
<p>can get audio feedback and by the type</p>
<p>of the sound it can tell you what&rsquo;s it</p>
<p>where the signals coming from this</p>
<p>coming from a cell phone is coming from</p>
<p>a Wi-Fi router is it coming from a cell</p>
<p>phone tower so it&rsquo;s pretty interesting</p>
<p>so from anything else will tell you the</p>
<p>level you can see it and hear it and so</p>
<p>you know those of you there watching</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s talking about a device to measure</p>
<p>EMF right well well one love one type of</p>
<p>EMF there&rsquo;s many types this is a radio</p>
<p>frequency typically from a few hundred</p>
<p>megahertz to like eight gigahertz but</p>
<p>then there&rsquo;s also higher frequencies and</p>
<p>radio frequencies and then there are</p>
<p>magnetic fields and electrical fields</p>
<p>this doesn&rsquo;t measure magnetic or</p>
<p>electrical fields okay so like around</p>
<p>someone&rsquo;s house what are some of the big</p>
<p>sources of EMF that&rsquo;s a great question</p>
<p>probably the most important is I already</p>
<p>mentioned the Wi-Fi router Wow your cell</p>
<p>phones are the two biggest threats you</p>
<p>have here to your health so for that</p>
<p>problem what is the solution for that</p>
<p>problem well the first step the baby</p>
<p>step to get you put your toe in the</p>
<p>water is to turn off your router at</p>
<p>night because you&rsquo;re not using it okay</p>
<p>turn off your router or night you can</p>
<p>easily do that you can buy a $25 switch</p>
<p>you plug in your you actually plug your</p>
<p>router into that and then you can</p>
<p>control the switch with a with like a</p>
<p>garage remote control</p>
<p>but the bet the law that&rsquo;s not the</p>
<p>long-term solution launcher solution is</p>
<p>to get rid of your turn your wife left</p>
<p>permanently in hardwire your house pain</p>
<p>in the butt but it&rsquo;ll help you and your</p>
<p>family quite a bit you know I I agree a</p>
<p>hundred percent because I there was a</p>
<p>our power went down for three days in</p>
<p>her house and all the Wi-Fi went down</p>
<p>and man did I just I slept better</p>
<p>I felt better I&rsquo;m like what what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>different I just feel so good yeah and</p>
<p>he saw also my computer my hard drive</p>
<p>was very close to underneath my desk and</p>
<p>I felt like I was literally being</p>
<p>electrified every single day as like it</p>
<p>and I said get this thing well you well</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not your hard drive it&rsquo;s that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>that your computer is using the Wi-Fi</p>
<p>st. Louis right next to you so and that</p>
<p>and don&rsquo;t make the mistake I did say you</p>
<p>hardwire your house right you know have</p>
<p>no Wi-Fi you still have to go to your</p>
<p>desktop even though there&rsquo;s an Ethernet</p>
<p>cable and it&rsquo;s getting a signal from the</p>
<p>ethernet you have to turn the Wi-Fi off</p>
<p>you have to put in an airplane mode just</p>
<p>like your phone otherwise it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>continuing to blast you with a signal</p>
<p>okay yeah so it&rsquo;s the confident Devils</p>
<p>of the details because your body it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t matter what your attention is</p>
<p>you have to take it attention to details</p>
<p>because your body will suffer otherwise</p>
<p>can you hurry up and finish this book</p>
<p>well the book is almost finished I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>just tweaking I it&rsquo;s already written I</p>
<p>just have to put it together in a in a</p>
<p>cohesive and motivating and catalyzing</p>
<p>way so that it will convince people of</p>
<p>the dangers but there&rsquo;s a lot of books</p>
<p>written up this is not the only one and</p>
<p>I said Nick&rsquo;s book is really pretty good</p>
<p>for the most part it&rsquo;s just not gonna go</p>
<p>in as much of the science as I&rsquo;m gonna</p>
<p>do and really some of the other</p>
<p>components and go more into the</p>
<p>deception in the fraud so that people</p>
<p>aren&rsquo;t because what people understand</p>
<p>the basic reason why they&rsquo;re being</p>
<p>deceived and manipulated then there are</p>
<p>more open to the science I think because</p>
<p>you scan him with a science you got a</p>
<p>you got a paint the picture for ya see</p>
<p>see the full frame yeah and then the</p>
<p>other thing is that I think one of the</p>
<p>big challenges is especially when I did</p>
<p>or do our summit we had the speakers fly</p>
<p>in and people want application</p>
<p>want simple ways of applying it because</p>
<p>right they don&rsquo;t want all the science</p>
<p>they want okay what do I do with this</p>
<p>information you know what practical</p>
<p>things yeah well you need to be</p>
<p>motivated first of all that&rsquo;s the key</p>
<p>Thanks so that&rsquo;s the reason for the</p>
<p>science and for me I I was it gave me a</p>
<p>simple implementation measures to follow</p>
<p>but unless I was convinced it was an</p>
<p>issue I wouldn&rsquo;t do it I didn&rsquo;t do</p>
<p>anything right we convinced first right</p>
<p>but next book goes into great detail all</p>
<p>little little things but the most</p>
<p>important thing is your cell phone and</p>
<p>your Wi-Fi may those are the big ones I</p>
<p>mean the magnetic fields are an issue</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re pretty easy to find and</p>
<p>mitigate against electrical fields</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot more complex topic that we</p>
<p>have time to talk about now but but it</p>
<p>does things it is a big issue for people</p>
<p>with solar panels and I happen to have</p>
<p>you know 15 kilowatts of solar panels on</p>
<p>my roof and the problem is there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>nothing no nothing wrong with the solar</p>
<p>panels because they create DC power and</p>
<p>DC power is fine the problem is that you</p>
<p>anyone who is almost anyone who&rsquo;s using</p>
<p>them has an AC converter so they</p>
<p>converts the DC to AC instead inverter</p>
<p>that causes the complication which</p>
<p>creates a massive amount was called</p>
<p>dirty electricity which inputs high</p>
<p>voltage transients into your wiring</p>
<p>system which causes electrical fields</p>
<p>which go go throughout the wiring of</p>
<p>your housing can cause similar problems</p>
<p>as the cellphones Wow a mechanism Wow</p>
<p>fortunately there&rsquo;s things that you can</p>
<p>do to address that but most but you got</p>
<p>to know it&rsquo;s an issue to begin with</p>
<p>right yeah this is fascinating</p>
<p>this is great data I had no idea now you</p>
<p>got me really interested now I&rsquo;m gonna</p>
<p>dive in the optics here I&rsquo;ll pick up</p>
<p>next book because that&rsquo;ll give me the</p>
<p>best strategy right away cuz my books</p>
<p>not gonna be out for it could be out</p>
<p>within a year</p>
<p>I mean it&rsquo;s entually written I just had</p>
<p>to fine-tune it well and the book I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>ready now now we&rsquo;ll see the book I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>ready and now it&rsquo;s going to be it&rsquo;s my</p>
<p>master but it&rsquo;s gonna have thousands of</p>
<p>references it&rsquo;s how it&rsquo;s how to extend</p>
<p>your life but but it&rsquo;s based on the</p>
<p>preceding book so you know intermittent</p>
<p>fasting</p>
<p>partial fasting e-m-f remediation you</p>
<p>got to do those that&rsquo;s the basics right</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t do to the advanced stuff until</p>
<p>you do the basics</p>
<p>agree</p>
<p>yeah down and then when you&rsquo;re there</p>
<p>then you can do the fine-tuning awesome</p>
<p>Wow well thank you so much for your time</p>
<p>this has been great I think a lot of</p>
<p>people got a lot of great content and</p>
<p>also a lot of ideas to start we opened a</p>
<p>can of worms but now it&rsquo;s time for them</p>
<p>also to take do their own research and</p>
<p>start learning about these you know be a</p>
<p>skeptic I think it&rsquo;s their skepticism is</p>
<p>a healthy strategy you know you have to</p>
<p>be careful and ideally validate these</p>
<p>things yourself I mean it has a good</p>
<p>source you says be careful especially</p>
<p>with with the EMF because you&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>find a lot of confusing material out</p>
<p>there based on the deception and fraud</p>
<p>that the telecommunications industry is</p>
<p>introducing into the system so no but</p>
<p>you can you can pretty much if you go to</p>
<p>these studies you can see who funded</p>
<p>them and find out you know why they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>confused</p>
<p>fascinating Wow well thank you so much</p>
<p>for spending the time okay well good to</p>
<p>be with you</p>
