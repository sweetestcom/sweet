    <p>Our card this week is David Camperetto, the King of Hearts from Florida.</p>
<p>David was 30 years old in the early 1990s, had multiple jobs that earned him a steady</p>
<p>income, had a loving family to go home to, and was someone who kept a smile on his face</p>
<p>every day.</p>
<p>But on October 16th, 1993, all of that changed.</p>
<p>David vanished, only to be found burned inside his car right outside of his hometown.</p>
<p>For the last 29 years, his killer has remained unidentified, and the motive behind the crime</p>
<p>is no closer to being understood than it was nearly three decades ago.</p>
<p>Detectives say they can solve this case, they just need help from you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Ashley Flowers, and this is The Deck.</p>
<p>On Saturday, October 16th, 1993, around 8 o&rsquo;clock that night, a woman named Diana,</p>
<p>who worked at a Publix grocery store in Fort Myers, Florida, noticed her co-worker, David</p>
<p>Camperetto, acting strange.</p>
<p>Normally, Diana knew David to be a happy-go-lucky kind of guy.</p>
<p>When he&rsquo;d clocked in for his shift at 4 p.m. earlier that day, he&rsquo;d been in a good</p>
<p>mood and had spent most of his downtime that night using the store&rsquo;s phone to catch up</p>
<p>with friends.</p>
<p>But right after 8 p.m., Diana noticed David got really bent out of shape after he&rsquo;d</p>
<p>received a brief phone call.</p>
<p>After he&rsquo;d hung up the receiver, Diana could tell that David was visibly upset, shaking</p>
<p>and crying, I mean to the point where the rest of his co-workers could tell that something</p>
<p>was definitely wrong.</p>
<p>Diana and David were pretty close friends, so she asked him what was going on and why</p>
<p>he was spiraling, but the only thing he would tell her was, quote,</p>
<p>Something is going to happen.</p>
<p>Someone is waiting, and I&rsquo;m afraid to go outside the door.</p>
<p>What do I do?</p>
<p>End quote.</p>
<p>Diana was shaken up by David&rsquo;s bizarre response, and unfortunately she couldn&rsquo;t calm him down</p>
<p>or get any more information from him before he abruptly clocked out of his shift early,</p>
<p>took off out the store&rsquo;s front doors, and ran to his blue Ford Tempo parked in the parking</p>
<p>lot.</p>
<p>After David walked out, Diana and all of his other co-workers didn&rsquo;t know what to</p>
<p>do.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t call the police because they weren&rsquo;t really sure what to even tell them.</p>
<p>Instead, they just figured David had something personal come up and they&rsquo;d learn all about</p>
<p>it the next day when he came into work.</p>
<p>But that wouldn&rsquo;t happen, because a few hours later, the Lee County Emergency Dispatchers</p>
<p>received a 911 call from a man walking on the outskirts of the county in an area known</p>
<p>as Lehigh Acres.</p>
<p>The call came in around 11 p.m., and it was disturbing.</p>
<p>The guy told authorities that he wanted to report a car fire in a vacant field.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s Lee County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office Cold Case Sergeant Marcia Sutphin.</p>
<p>The vehicle itself was actively engulfed in flames when the 911 caller noticed the vehicle,</p>
<p>and by the time fire arrived, it was fully engulfed.</p>
<p>As soon as the firefighters put out the blaze, they checked what was left of the car for</p>
<p>anyone inside.</p>
<p>The front seats and back seats were empty, but when they opened the trunk, they found</p>
<p>a man&rsquo;s lifeless body crumpled up in the fetal position.</p>
<p>In that moment, the fire department realized that they were probably dealing with a crime</p>
<p>scene, so they called in homicide detectives from the Lee County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office to</p>
<p>investigate.</p>
<p>When those deputies arrived, they quickly determined the car was a Ford Tempo, and it</p>
<p>was registered to 30-year-old David Camperetto from Fort Myers.</p>
<p>The question investigators couldn&rsquo;t answer right away, though, was, was David the man</p>
<p>in the trunk?</p>
<p>And if so, who had brought him so far outside of town to kill him in such a heinous way?</p>
<p>According to Sergeant Sutphin, detectives at the scene processed David&rsquo;s car for clues.</p>
<p>Obviously, fire destroys much of what it touches, but it doesn&rsquo;t destroy everything, and we</p>
<p>were able to collect some things from the scene.</p>
<p>Luckily, they were able to collect several hairs and fingerprints from the charred remains,</p>
<p>and they next tried to canvas the nearby streets and neighborhoods for eyewitnesses, but struck</p>
<p>out.</p>
<p>His vehicle was located out on a pretty desolate area of Lehigh Acres.</p>
<p>At the time, it was not as built up as it is today.</p>
<p>After the body from the trunk was transported for an autopsy, it didn&rsquo;t take investigators</p>
<p>long to positively ID the victim as David.</p>
<p>Now, because this case is still active, the Lee County Medical Examiner and the state</p>
<p>fire marshal&rsquo;s office have never released David&rsquo;s official autopsy or the arson investigation</p>
<p>report, so I&rsquo;m not sure what state his body was in when he was brought in.</p>
<p>We also don&rsquo;t know how the fire was set inside the car, like if gasoline was used or what.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s information that only the investigators and the killer or killers know.</p>
<p>The only information that has been released publicly is that the pathologist determined</p>
<p>David died of smoke inhalation, which meant that he was still alive and breathing when</p>
<p>he was forced into his trunk and then the car was set on fire.</p>
<p>Shortly after identifying his body, authorities broke the news to David&rsquo;s parents, Patsy</p>
<p>and Sal.</p>
<p>Learning what happened to their son devastated the couple.</p>
<p>You see, ever since they&rsquo;d gotten married in the late 1950s, Patsy and Sal had tried</p>
<p>their hardest to conceive naturally.</p>
<p>Viable pregnancies had been a challenge for them, so they decided to try adoption instead.</p>
<p>And in 1963, their dreams came true when they adopted David as a baby.</p>
<p>At the time, staff at the hospital had actually discouraged the couple from choosing David</p>
<p>because they said he&rsquo;d been born with severe medical issues, including a deformity that</p>
<p>doctors labeled as clubbed feet.</p>
<p>But none of that mattered to Patsy and Sal.</p>
<p>They fell in love with David and took him home.</p>
<p>Patsy actually told Fox 4 News, quote, I didn&rsquo;t see nothing but his face.</p>
<p>And right then he was my baby, end quote.</p>
<p>During middle school and high school, the couple learned the depth of their son&rsquo;s disabilities</p>
<p>went beyond just physical.</p>
<p>David was socially challenged as well, which caused him to be shy and sometimes naive.</p>
<p>Patsy told Fox 4 that David had trouble differentiating between what most people would consider to</p>
<p>be factual information and what was fantasy or people teasing him.</p>
<p>Everyone who knew David back then described him as, you know, a meek, kind, very helpful</p>
<p>young man.</p>
<p>Many people actually struggled to call him a man, you know, a young man, because his</p>
<p>demeanor was very much that of a young, young adult or a teenager, if you will.</p>
<p>Despite his challenges, though, his parents said David grew up as a fairly normal kid.</p>
<p>He had friends, participated in extracurricular activities, graduated from Fort Myers High</p>
<p>School, got his driver&rsquo;s license and maintained several part-time jobs.</p>
<p>But not long after entering the working world, though, his parents noticed that David started</p>
<p>to hang out with and be influenced by a group of young men who were sort of a rough crowd</p>
<p>and frequented strip clubs in the Fort Myers area.</p>
<p>Patsy and Sal discouraged their son from joining in with what they considered to be inappropriate</p>
<p>activities like that, but technically David was an adult.</p>
<p>He could do what he wanted.</p>
<p>Over time, Patsy and Sal noticed David spent more and more nights at strip clubs with his</p>
<p>friends and he was getting very close with several of the dancers.</p>
<p>Sergeant Sutphin and Crimestoppers spokeswoman Trish Rout says this never settled well with</p>
<p>his parents, but in reality, it may have been his only outlet to have interaction with women.</p>
<p>This caused his parents some concern, obviously.</p>
<p>They had some worry about the people that he would encounter and these types of places,</p>
<p>but they knew it made David happy.</p>
<p>So while they cautioned him about going to these places, they understood why it made</p>
<p>David happy, being that his intellectual delays made it difficult for him to find companionship</p>
<p>on his own, if you will.</p>
<p>He went because the girls would pay attention to him.</p>
<p>He had not a violent or bad bone in his body, but in the strip club type of situation, girls</p>
<p>are going to pay attention to you because they&rsquo;re looking for money.</p>
<p>But at the end of the day, David was just looking for somebody to pay attention to him.</p>
<p>Although it wasn&rsquo;t the ideal place to be, that&rsquo;s where he chose to be because he had</p>
<p>connections.</p>
<p>He was making conversational connections with these women and that made him happy.</p>
<p>Detectives looking into his murder learned quickly that strip clubs and David&rsquo;s friends,</p>
<p>which included some dancers, were going to be the best place to start to try and piece</p>
<p>together a timeline of his life and habits.</p>
<p>What they learned was that according to David&rsquo;s parents, he&rsquo;d woken up on the morning of</p>
<p>October 16th, gotten dressed for the day, done some things around the house, ate lunch,</p>
<p>and then he headed out to one of his friends named Gary Hughes house around two or three</p>
<p>o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon.</p>
<p>When detectives interviewed Gary, he told them that yes, David had stopped by his place</p>
<p>and then the two of them had hung out and talked about going to the strip club later</p>
<p>that night.</p>
<p>Gary was a DJ at a club called Paradise and during their conversation, the men had talked</p>
<p>about how the business had been kind of dead lately and the dancers weren&rsquo;t getting as</p>
<p>much work as they normally did.</p>
<p>About a quarter to four, Gary said that David left his house and headed to his job at Publix.</p>
<p>When detectives questioned the staff at the store, including Diana, they learned about</p>
<p>that bizarre phone call that David had gotten around eight o&rsquo;clock and how he&rsquo;d taken off</p>
<p>early.</p>
<p>Diana also told investigators that before David&rsquo;s departure around five o&rsquo;clock, he&rsquo;d</p>
<p>been talking on the phone with other people and she had a name.</p>
<p>She said that that person may have a lot more information.</p>
<p>Diana told detectives that a few hours before abruptly leaving his shift, David had been</p>
<p>speaking on the phone with a woman named Michelle that she knew was a dancer at a local strip</p>
<p>club.</p>
<p>About two hours after that, the store&rsquo;s phone records show that David had made another phone</p>
<p>call.</p>
<p>This one to a DJ named Larry Gore, who worked at a strip club called Mermaid&rsquo;s Lounge.</p>
<p>When questioned about their conversation, Larry told investigators that David had called</p>
<p>him just to catch up and chat about their day.</p>
<p>He said the call hadn&rsquo;t lasted more than a few minutes before David had to hang up</p>
<p>and do some things at work.</p>
<p>Now, Diana emphasized to police that David speaking on the phone with strip club dancers</p>
<p>and DJs while he was at work actually wasn&rsquo;t unusual.</p>
<p>She said that the store&rsquo;s manager and all of the other staff knew David didn&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>the same social skills as everyone else, and so they let him do some personal stuff like</p>
<p>take calls while he was clocked in, just so he could have that interaction with people</p>
<p>that he said he cared about.</p>
<p>David regularly made phone calls with women who worked as dancers because he considered</p>
<p>them his friends.</p>
<p>He would often talk with Diana about how he ran errands for the women, sometimes bought</p>
<p>them or their kids meals, and would deliver packages for their bosses who owned the strip</p>
<p>clubs.</p>
<p>Now, detectives knew David left Publix sometime right after 8 o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<p>The next time they could account for David&rsquo;s whereabouts before his murder was around 9</p>
<p>o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<p>A man named Wayne Woodring told authorities that he&rsquo;d received a phone call from David</p>
<p>asking him to meet up at Burt&rsquo;s Strip Club off US 41 in Fort Myers.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know where David would have placed that call from.</p>
<p>All we know from speaking with investigators is that he didn&rsquo;t go home to make that call.</p>
<p>We know he didn&rsquo;t use the phone at Publix to dial Wayne, and at the time he didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have a cell phone.</p>
<p>Now Wayne agreed, and by 9.30 the men were hanging out at Burt&rsquo;s, catching up and admiring</p>
<p>the dancers while eating at the snack bar.</p>
<p>Obviously, this part of the story and everything that Wayne is saying doesn&rsquo;t really add up</p>
<p>with how David&rsquo;s mood was when he left Publix abruptly.</p>
<p>Diana said that David seemed super distraught, but then according to Wayne, like an hour</p>
<p>later David&rsquo;s chumming it up with him at Burt&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s definitely some discrepancy here, and investigators noticed it too.</p>
<p>Dancers at Burt&rsquo;s and at least one other bouncer told detectives that between 10 and 10.30</p>
<p>they saw David hanging out, but then around 10.30 he left with a man walking behind him,</p>
<p>and it was a man that they knew had not arrived with David.</p>
<p>What happened to David after he left is a little TBD.</p>
<p>There were some reports that David went to Mermaid&rsquo;s Lounge after leaving Burt&rsquo;s, but</p>
<p>most of the reports say he was actually there before.</p>
<p>Either way, police went to Mermaid&rsquo;s to follow up.</p>
<p>A dancer named Jennifer, who worked there, who knew David well, told investigators that</p>
<p>she&rsquo;d seen the 30-year-old come in, but right away she noticed something was off.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s audio from an interview an original detective on the case had with Jennifer.</p>
<p>When Jennifer told police that David seemed off while briefly inside Mermaid&rsquo;s Lounge,</p>
<p>that forced investigators to ask the question, was David really under duress while at Mermaid&rsquo;s</p>
<p>and Burt&rsquo;s, regardless of the order in which he went to the bars?</p>
<p>Or was he just telling Jennifer the same thing that he told his co-workers at Publix?</p>
<p>No matter how they sliced it, to the detectives it seemed like David had very different interactions</p>
<p>with people shortly before his murder that made figuring out his state of mind harder</p>
<p>and harder.</p>
<p>Regardless, though, detectives were eager to speak with the strange man that Jennifer</p>
<p>said she&rsquo;d seen walk into Mermaid&rsquo;s with David, the same guy that he had left Burt&rsquo;s</p>
<p>with.</p>
<p>The problem was, no one working at either one of those clubs seemed to know who the</p>
<p>guy was, or at least they weren&rsquo;t willing to give up his name.</p>
<p>Jennifer told deputies that all she knew about the guy was that on occasion she&rsquo;d seen him</p>
<p>at another strip club in Fort Myers called Paradise Club.</p>
<p>David coincidentally worked part-time for Paradise as a sort of side hustle.</p>
<p>He would basically be what you would consider maybe an intern in the strip club world.</p>
<p>He ran errands for the owner, a guy named Jamie Carrillo, and would visit with the dancers.</p>
<p>The only other information the staff at Mermaid&rsquo;s could tell investigators about the night of</p>
<p>October 16th was that while David had been there, he&rsquo;d gone to the bar, used the bathroom,</p>
<p>and then asked a bouncer if a dancer named Tiffany was working, which the bouncer said</p>
<p>she wasn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Another dancer who was on shift, though, confirmed to police that David had been looking for</p>
<p>this Tiffany woman for at least a week or two leading up to that night.</p>
<p>Both Jennifer and this other dancer said the entire time David was in the lounge, he&rsquo;d</p>
<p>been accompanied by that strange man they vaguely recognized.</p>
<p>Jennifer said that at one point the guy pushed David and told him to hurry up.</p>
<p>The other dancer who saw David told investigators that her interaction with him had been brief,</p>
<p>but he did say something about getting a phone call.</p>
<p>Did you see him walk out the door?</p>
<p>Talked to me for a few minutes.</p>
<p>He was in a hurry.</p>
<p>He was saying something about a conversation he had just had.</p>
<p>With who?</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t say who.</p>
<p>He just said a conversation on the phone.</p>
<p>After 10.30 p.m., Lee County investigators could not account for David.</p>
<p>No one reported seeing him after that.</p>
<p>The only thing detectives knew for sure was that by 11 p.m. that night, the 911 caller</p>
<p>in Lehigh Acres reported David&rsquo;s car on fire.</p>
<p>So that left a really narrow window of time, about 30 minutes, for David to be taken from</p>
<p>Fort Myers to Lehigh Acres and his car set ablaze with him still alive inside of it.</p>
<p>Current Lee County Sheriff Carmine Marcino still has a hard time comprehending how the</p>
<p>killer or killers worked so fast without being seen and why they chose to commit such a violent</p>
<p>crime against David.</p>
<p>This case, it&rsquo;s disturbing.</p>
<p>Here we have a mentally challenged adult who is burnt in his car.</p>
<p>So I mean, I can&rsquo;t even believe, you think about that alone, you know, homicide is, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>insane.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s no excuse.</p>
<p>I mean, we can go through many different reasons why it&rsquo;s wrong in every which way.</p>
<p>When someone shoots someone, it&rsquo;s pretty quick.</p>
<p>When someone burns to death in a car, it&rsquo;s completely different.</p>
<p>Back in 1993, the one place detectives dug into further for leads was the Paradise Club</p>
<p>where David had worked part-time.</p>
<p>And there was someone who stuck out immediately, the owner of the club, Jamie Carrillo.</p>
<p>Turned out, Jamie was sitting in jail facing federal drug charges on the day that David</p>
<p>was killed, and authorities theorized he might have had motive to want David dead.</p>
<p>According to the Lee County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office, the DEA busted Jamie Carrillo several months</p>
<p>before David&rsquo;s murder and charged him with drug trafficking.</p>
<p>The accusations were that Jamie was involved in smuggling and illegally transporting drugs</p>
<p>throughout Fort Myers, possibly through his businesses and associates.</p>
<p>When investigators probed into Jamie&rsquo;s past a little more, they learned that David sometimes</p>
<p>would make deliveries for him to and from Paradise Club.</p>
<p>And he may have unknowingly been partaking in illegal activity, but just didn&rsquo;t realize it.</p>
<p>Detectives&rsquo; suspicions were that David was too naive to know and understand that Aaron&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Jamie sent him on might not have just been David doing some nice favors.</p>
<p>The problem was, authorities were never able to prove their suspicions.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s Sergeant Sutphin again.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just another one of the many theories that have come up over the years.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re right, Jamie Carrillo was the owner of the Paradise Club.</p>
<p>And in the months prior to David&rsquo;s murder, he had been arrested along with several of</p>
<p>his associates for some drug-related trafficking charges, I believe it was.</p>
<p>And during the initial investigation, there was some speculation that perhaps David had</p>
<p>been running some errands for Jamie, maybe related to the drug aspect of his life.</p>
<p>But again, it&rsquo;s another theory, another speculation.</p>
<p>The reason investigators back in 1993 gave so much thought to Jamie possibly being involved</p>
<p>was because they learned that Gary, the Paradise DJ who was David&rsquo;s friend, who he had hung</p>
<p>out with that afternoon before the murder, had visited Jamie in jail the morning of October 16th.</p>
<p>Several strip club dancers who&rsquo;d spoken with Gary later that night told detectives</p>
<p>that Gary said he told Jamie everything would work out for him.</p>
<p>And the people who&rsquo;d put him in prison and ratted him out to the DEA were going to, quote, pay.</p>
<p>Now, the names of the individuals who&rsquo;d cooperated with federal authorities were never</p>
<p>made public, though, so it&rsquo;s unclear if perhaps Jamie and Gary thought David was one</p>
<p>of those informants.</p>
<p>To this day, even the Lee County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office doesn&rsquo;t know that information.</p>
<p>Eventually, investigators had to move on from their suspicions about Gary and Jamie because</p>
<p>they just didn&rsquo;t have enough evidence or cooperation from witnesses to pursue them</p>
<p>as persons of interest.</p>
<p>Over the years, detectives have spent numerous hours upon hours upon hours interviewing witnesses</p>
<p>and trying to identify suspects and gathering background information on people associated</p>
<p>with David and associated with the clubs, trying to identify who would want to harm</p>
<p>David in this way.</p>
<p>And unfortunately, to this date, a viable suspect has not been identified.</p>
<p>The next theory detectives considered was whether maybe David had gotten too friendly</p>
<p>with a strip club dancer and one of those women&rsquo;s boyfriends had gotten mad and decided</p>
<p>to retaliate.</p>
<p>The sheriff&rsquo;s office told us that several months before David was killed, he&rsquo;d actually</p>
<p>been attacked at a strip club in Sarasota.</p>
<p>A dancer&rsquo;s boyfriend or brother had assaulted him and David ended up pressing charges for</p>
<p>But ultimately, that case was dropped.</p>
<p>So the idea that David might have gotten too close to a dancer, even though he was considered</p>
<p>harmless, might have rubbed some guy the wrong way.</p>
<p>Trish Routt with Southwest Florida Crimestoppers thinks that if this was the case, though,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what prompted someone to murder David, they more than likely did not understand</p>
<p>that he had disabilities.</p>
<p>David would not have hurt anybody ever.</p>
<p>He probably wouldn&rsquo;t have even spoken a foul word about somebody.</p>
<p>So whoever did this, I&rsquo;m assuming did not know David&rsquo;s situation and the challenges</p>
<p>that David faced, the disabilities that he had, again, the social awkwardness that he</p>
<p>had because he was not deserving of anybody to execute any level of violence against him,</p>
<p>more or less burning him to death in a vehicle.</p>
<p>The only other lead investigators could look into was why he was searching for the dancer</p>
<p>named Tiffany.</p>
<p>But again, that avenue of investigation fizzled out, too, because no one from the club scene</p>
<p>would help detectives find out who she was, if Tiffany was even her real name or if she</p>
<p>really worked at the club in Fort Myers at all.</p>
<p>Today, the sheriff&rsquo;s office is hoping that they can work with what little bit of physical</p>
<p>evidence they have in this case to help narrow down a potential suspect pool or at least</p>
<p>have more information to go on, like DNA, for example.</p>
<p>Investigators back in 1993 did find hair in David&rsquo;s car and near his body that current</p>
<p>investigators still have.</p>
<p>They were also able to pull some possible fingerprints.</p>
<p>In an interview with our team, Sergeant Sutphin confirmed that at least some of the hairs</p>
<p>came back as belonging to David.</p>
<p>But there were also hairs that belonged to an unknown person, as well as other items</p>
<p>that contained DNA.</p>
<p>What those items are, though, is something Sutphin can&rsquo;t go into detail about.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;d like to completely describe the entire crime scene.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t describe everything because that could be detrimental to corroborating testimony</p>
<p>from people who may come forward later.</p>
<p>Right now, what cold case detectives are banking on is forensic testing to help them identify</p>
<p>a potential suspect.</p>
<p>But even if they get that, they&rsquo;ll still need the public&rsquo;s help to generate conversation</p>
<p>and get people who were around in 1993 to start talking.</p>
<p>They believe that there is much more to the story than what science can prove.</p>
<p>And they need actual people who saw David, anyone that he was with, or who overheard</p>
<p>conversations related to his murder to come forward.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve always got to leave the possibility out there that the theories that have come</p>
<p>forth are just simply that, theories, and there may be something else completely unknown</p>
<p>out there that we don&rsquo;t know yet.</p>
<p>This is not an impossible case to solve.</p>
<p>It is possible, what we just need the right information from the right person and the</p>
<p>right time to come forward is now.</p>
<p>If there are people that are still around that know, you&rsquo;re much older now, and the</p>
<p>way that you viewed the world 25, 30 years ago is much different than I&rsquo;m sure the</p>
<p>way you perceive the world now.</p>
<p>People that have information may now be parents or grandparents, I mean, totally different</p>
<p>stage of life where, you know, I get when you&rsquo;re younger, you don&rsquo;t want to get</p>
<p>involved and you&rsquo;re trying to just live your life.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want to be involved.</p>
<p>But now as a parent or maybe even a grandparent, you look at life through a different set of lenses.</p>
<p>David&rsquo;s parents are getting older and are no longer in good health.</p>
<p>A lot of detectives who have worked on this case over the years wished they could have</p>
<p>solved it before they retired.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s up to Marsha Sutphin and others in the department to get David justice and give</p>
<p>his family some answers.</p>
<p>Before their time on this earth is gone, they want to know that they can have some closure</p>
<p>and some justice.</p>
<p>Nothing&rsquo;s going to bring David back, but just the not knowing, all these years of not knowing,</p>
<p>at least having justice will be able to allow them to conclude their lives at some point,</p>
<p>at least knowing, with that little bit of peace.</p>
<p>Because until they know what happened to David, until they know who&rsquo;s responsible for David&rsquo;s</p>
<p>murder, you just can&rsquo;t live life the same way.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s their son, their only son.</p>
<p>David&rsquo;s case is one that so many law enforcement investigators in Lee County hold near and</p>
<p>dear to their hearts.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s one that the current sheriff says he makes a priority every single day.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to find you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to find you.</p>
<p>The message is loud and clear.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to do everything possible, and we&rsquo;re never going to stop trying to find out</p>
<p>who killed David Camperetto.</p>
<p>So many people want to see this killer behind bars, and I&rsquo;m one of them.</p>
<p>If you have any information about the murder of David Camperetto, please call the Lee County</p>
<p>Sheriff&rsquo;s Office and Southwest Florida Crime Stoppers at 1-800-780-8477.</p>
