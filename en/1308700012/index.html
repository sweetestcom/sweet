    <p>Our card this week is Anne Klein, the aid of hearts from Indiana.</p>
<p>Anne was a loving wife and devoted teacher who was well on her way to earning a master&rsquo;s</p>
<p>degree, when one winter afternoon in 1973, she was viciously attacked outside her classroom.</p>
<p>This episode is a special one because I&rsquo;ve wanted to tell Anne&rsquo;s story ever since I</p>
<p>first heard about it years ago, long before we ever started this show.</p>
<p>I just didn&rsquo;t have enough information.</p>
<p>That is, until now, when the detectives working her case agreed to speak with us.</p>
<p>And they say that they might be closer than they&rsquo;ve ever been to finding her killer.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Ashley Flowers, and this is The Deck.</p>
<p>On January 18th, 1973, college student Dennis Klem had just wrapped up his last class of</p>
<p>the day at Lockyer College of Business in downtown Evansville, Indiana.</p>
<p>The business college was temporarily holding classes in the basement of the old courthouse</p>
<p>downtown due to a fire at the actual college campus a week before.</p>
<p>Now, Dennis also worked as a custodian in the old courthouse, so in order to report</p>
<p>for work when he got out of class, all he had to do was go up a few flights of stairs</p>
<p>and he was able to punch in his time card.</p>
<p>On that particular day, his shift didn&rsquo;t start until three.</p>
<p>Dennis had wrapped up his last class of the day a few minutes before that, like around</p>
<p>2.45.</p>
<p>So to kill some time, he decided to go back downstairs to the basement where he&rsquo;d just</p>
<p>been for a class and ask one of his accounting teachers, Mrs. Anne Klein, what grade he&rsquo;d</p>
<p>gotten on an accounting test.</p>
<p>When Dennis got to the basement, he found Mrs. Klein exactly where he&rsquo;d expected her</p>
<p>to be, behind her desk in her temporary classroom.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for Dennis, Anne told him she was still in the process of grading the test,</p>
<p>so he&rsquo;d have to wait a little bit longer to find out what his score was.</p>
<p>At about ten to three, Dennis heads back upstairs to report for his work shift, and</p>
<p>when he arrived, he bumped into one of his coworkers who was also a business school student.</p>
<p>At three on the dot, the two men headed to a room on the second level to start their</p>
<p>cleaning duties for the day.</p>
<p>But just as they were arriving to that room, they heard screaming.</p>
<p>The shrieks weren&rsquo;t coming from a room over, or even on the same level, they sounded distant,</p>
<p>but maybe they were coming from downstairs in the building&rsquo;s basement.</p>
<p>Dennis and his coworker kind of froze and looked at each other, but then the screaming</p>
<p>stopped, so they shrugged it off as maybe just some kids playing.</p>
<p>Which might sound weird at a courthouse slash college, but you see, Lockyer was a two-year</p>
<p>business college, so students were a little older than your typical college-age students,</p>
<p>and many people who attended classes were parents of young children.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t unusual for students to bring their kids to class sometimes.</p>
<p>Right after the faint screaming stopped, they heard a man&rsquo;s voice that said something along</p>
<p>the lines of, get out here, or get out of here.</p>
<p>Dennis and his coworker just couldn&rsquo;t tell for sure.</p>
<p>The voice was much more pronounced than the screams, and sounded urgent, so Dennis and</p>
<p>his coworker hightailed it downstairs to see what was going on.</p>
<p>The old Vanderburgh County Courthouse, where this is all happening, is this massive, ornate</p>
<p>government building that was built in the late 1890s.</p>
<p>Up until 1969, it still functioned as a courthouse, but then all government services moved to</p>
<p>a civic center in another part of downtown.</p>
<p>Today county commissioners lease out rooms to various businesses, and it&rsquo;s still known</p>
<p>as the old courthouse.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a beautiful old building with massive corridors for hallways, really tall ceilings,</p>
<p>a grand rotunda, and a bell tower.</p>
<p>The basement, though, has creepier vibes.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s Evansville Police Detective Sergeant Peter DeYoung.</p>
<p>Very secluded, there are no windows, there are just the two doors, it&rsquo;s pretty dark.</p>
<p>When Dennis and his coworker got down there, they couldn&rsquo;t believe what they saw.</p>
<p>Their accounting teacher, Ann Kline, was on the floor of the hallway, covered in blood.</p>
<p>She had several stab wounds all over her chest, and even one on her face.</p>
<p>They could tell right away she was already dead.</p>
<p>So shocked and horrified, they ran back upstairs to the closest telephone, which was in the</p>
<p>administrator&rsquo;s office on the second floor.</p>
<p>Two more of their coworkers joined them, and within a matter of minutes, the Evansville</p>
<p>Police Department were on their way.</p>
<p>When officers walked into the basement hallway, they saw what Dennis and his coworkers had</p>
<p>seen, which was Ann laying on her back in the big hallway with her long, black hair</p>
<p>soaked in a pool of her own blood that was spread out wide around her body.</p>
<p>Ann was pronounced dead right then and there in the hallway of the old courthouse.</p>
<p>And police officers took statements from Dennis and his coworkers right there in the building&rsquo;s</p>
<p>basement.</p>
<p>Evansville Police Detective Sergeant Kyle Thierry is working the case today, alongside</p>
<p>Detective DeYoung.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll hear from both of them throughout this episode.</p>
<p>They say that the gruesome nature of Ann&rsquo;s murder caused many people who worked at the</p>
<p>school and attended classes to pull away from Lockyer entirely.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s Thierry.</p>
<p>It did get a lot of attention and it scared a lot of people.</p>
<p>In fact, we&rsquo;ve spoken to several former students that it kind of rattled them a bit.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve seen report cards where kids, like, immediately unenrolled from the college and</p>
<p>went elsewhere.</p>
<p>Police worked to preserve the crime scene by clearing everyone out of the basement.</p>
<p>They ushered building staff and people like Dennis away from Ann&rsquo;s body to keep them</p>
<p>from gawking at the bloody scene, but they didn&rsquo;t let them go home without providing</p>
<p>statements first.</p>
<p>All of this was unfolding just after 3 p.m., in the middle of the day, so police felt confident</p>
<p>that someone who worked in the building had to have seen the murderer, or at least might</p>
<p>know what direction the killer went to get out of the school.</p>
<p>Given how many stab wounds Ann had, they knew the perpetrator wouldn&rsquo;t have walked away</p>
<p>from the crime without being covered in blood.</p>
<p>Not only that, but police had arrived so fast that unless the killer had a car, like, waiting</p>
<p>right outside, they had to be nearby.</p>
<p>So detectives started talking to everyone they could as the coroner arrived and the</p>
<p>scene was being processed, but everyone was so shocked in those first few moments they</p>
<p>were no help to investigators.</p>
<p>Detectives briefly considered the idea that maybe whoever attacked Ann wanted to rob her,</p>
<p>but that just didn&rsquo;t add up.</p>
<p>She still had her wedding rings on, her purse was found in her classroom.</p>
<p>So I mean, that would be something we obviously look for on every major scene like this, is</p>
<p>would there be any signs of foul play?</p>
<p>Obviously with her having multiple stab wounds in her, that would be a foul play.</p>
<p>But as far as a robbery goes, like as far as a motive, I believe it doesn&rsquo;t look like</p>
<p>it would be a robbery.</p>
<p>If someone was stabbed 16, 19, almost 20 times, there&rsquo;s some sort of intimacy there, you know,</p>
<p>some sort of anger, some sort of, in my opinion, I wouldn&rsquo;t say that would be a random thing.</p>
<p>So detectives immediately considered the theory that maybe Ann&rsquo;s husband, Robert, was involved.</p>
<p>They needed to find out if he was accounted for from 2.30 p.m. until 3.30 p.m.</p>
<p>But police found Robert Kline, Ann&rsquo;s longtime partner, at work in Newburgh, Indiana, 20</p>
<p>minutes from the crime scene.</p>
<p>Newburgh is a whole town over from Evansville.</p>
<p>Alcoa Operations is a global aluminum production and supply company where Robert was an engineer,</p>
<p>and it was 16 miles east of where Ann was killed.</p>
<p>He was in meetings at the time of when this happened, and there were several other people</p>
<p>that verified that.</p>
<p>So he was quickly ruled out.</p>
<p>Just to cover their tracks, detectives snapped some photos of him.</p>
<p>He had no blood on him and no injuries.</p>
<p>And he was displaying all the signs of a shocked and distraught husband who had just found</p>
<p>out that his wife had been brutally killed.</p>
<p>And by all accounts, Robert and Ann had had a great marriage.</p>
<p>They were high school sweethearts who were both from rural Pennsylvania and got their</p>
<p>degrees at Penn State before marrying and moving to Newburgh in 1968 for jobs at Alcoa.</p>
<p>Robert in engineering and Ann in accounting.</p>
<p>But by 1970, Ann had left Alcoa for her teaching job at Lockyer.</p>
<p>In 1971, to further their educations even more, the couple enrolled in night classes</p>
<p>at the University of Evansville.</p>
<p>As busy and nonstop as they were, Robert and Ann&rsquo;s friends told police that the two had</p>
<p>a happy marriage and seemed very much in love.</p>
<p>No one knew of any drama in their life.</p>
<p>So police were perplexed.</p>
<p>The crime, by its very nature, appeared to be intimate, and Ann seemed to be the target</p>
<p>of someone&rsquo;s personal rage against her.</p>
<p>The Vanderburgh County Coroner&rsquo;s office took Ann&rsquo;s body for an autopsy.</p>
<p>During the exam, the deputy coroner determined that she&rsquo;d been stabbed 19 times, mostly</p>
<p>to her upper left chest area.</p>
<p>There was also a slashed wound to one of her arms and one to her face.</p>
<p>But the wound that ultimately killed her was straight to her heart.</p>
<p>The coroner also made note that there were no signs that Ann had been sexually assaulted.</p>
<p>So Ann&rsquo;s clothing and other evidence were given to investigators for processing.</p>
<p>There were some hair fibers that were collected at the scene on her hand.</p>
<p>There were some scrapings taken from her fingernails.</p>
<p>The deputy coroner estimated Ann&rsquo;s time of death to be around 3.15 p.m., so literally</p>
<p>minutes after Dennis Klem had last seen her alive grading papers in her classroom.</p>
<p>With each hour that passed after the crime, the cops knew that if the killer was a stranger</p>
<p>who&rsquo;d come to Lockyer with no other reason than to kill Ann, whoever they were, they</p>
<p>were getting further and further away.</p>
<p>But police had to consider the real possibility that the murderer was someone who worked in</p>
<p>the old courthouse building or attended classes at Lockyer.</p>
<p>It had to be someone that has access to her that, I mean this was in a daytime, in a public</p>
<p>place with people around.</p>
<p>So we would think it would be someone newer that has some sort of access to her.</p>
<p>So I would say yes, students could be persons of interest.</p>
<p>I mean, anybody could be a person of interest at this point, but I would say, yeah, I mean</p>
<p>students could be a person of interest.</p>
<p>Any extramarital stuff, if we ever come aware of it, could be persons of interest.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably only so many things that somebody would want to harm her for.</p>
<p>After investigators ruled out Robert, detectives decided to press Dennis and his co-workers</p>
<p>harder for information.</p>
<p>During their interviews, each of the men reiterated their stories of hearing the screams</p>
<p>in the building around three, immediately followed by the sound of what they thought</p>
<p>was a man&rsquo;s voice saying something like, get out here or get out of here.</p>
<p>None of these witnesses caved under pressure and all of them seemed to be genuinely disturbed</p>
<p>by the crime.</p>
<p>There was also the fact that none of them were bloody or unaccounted for at the time</p>
<p>of the murder.</p>
<p>Police realized that if Ann was last seen grading papers at 250, then witnesses heard</p>
<p>her screaming at three, and then she was dead by 315, that left a very narrow window</p>
<p>of time for the killer to enter the courthouse, locate Ann, end up in the hallway, stab her</p>
<p>multiple times, and then leave completely undetected.</p>
<p>Based on that, detectives determined one way the killer could have entered and left unnoticed</p>
<p>was by using a door in an alcove that led from the sidewalk of Fifth Street straight</p>
<p>into the basement hallway.</p>
<p>Those doors were the only way someone could have gotten access to Ann, committed the crime,</p>
<p>and left within 15 minutes.</p>
<p>If they&rsquo;d gone any other way in the building, they would have had to take several flights</p>
<p>of stairs and more than likely would have run into people.</p>
<p>That made investigators even more convinced that their likely suspect knew Ann and likely</p>
<p>knew exactly where to find her.</p>
<p>Because, I mean, even think about what I said earlier, this isn&rsquo;t where she had been teaching</p>
<p>for like years and years.</p>
<p>She was teaching out of a temporary classroom off campus just as of like a week before.</p>
<p>When our team went to Evansville to interview detectives Theory and DeYoung, our reporters</p>
<p>stopped by the old courthouse and actually took some photos.</p>
<p>If you go to thedeckpodcast.com, you can get a better visual of what that hallway and entrance</p>
<p>of the old courthouse looked like.</p>
<p>A few hours into their investigation, police started canvassing the neighborhoods and buildings</p>
<p>around the old courthouse.</p>
<p>They were looking for blood trails, but they didn&rsquo;t find a single drop.</p>
<p>The lack of blood or murder weapon at the scene was puzzling for police.</p>
<p>From the beginning, this case was defying the norm.</p>
<p>If Ann&rsquo;s murder wasn&rsquo;t domestic and it wasn&rsquo;t robbery, why had someone killed her in such</p>
<p>a vicious way?</p>
<p>Everyone investigators had spoken with shared story after story of how nice Ann was and</p>
<p>how her humble upbringing affected the way she cared for people around her.</p>
<p>I know she had a neighbor, several people commented on her being a country girl from</p>
<p>Pennsylvania and that she loved animals.</p>
<p>I think she had a neighbor that said something about she rescued some kittens once and a</p>
<p>couple people said she was a tough teacher, but she was fair.</p>
<p>Despite their best efforts and dozens of cops canvassing the old courthouse building and</p>
<p>grounds, detectives never found a murder weapon.</p>
<p>They assumed that they should be looking for a knife considering the size and shape of</p>
<p>Ann&rsquo;s wounds, but they couldn&rsquo;t even be a hundred percent sure because for all they</p>
<p>knew the killer could have used another sharp object to kill Ann.</p>
<p>Either way, it wasn&rsquo;t like a bloody knife or shard of something had shown up in the</p>
<p>building.</p>
<p>After exhausting their efforts searching Lockyer, police spread out their search area and actually</p>
<p>checked a nearby YMCA, which was a place that they knew transient men and women were known</p>
<p>to hang out.</p>
<p>But no one there had seen anything suspicious on the day Ann was killed.</p>
<p>As word of the murder spread, people in Evansville were on edge.</p>
<p>In the 70s, the small city was made up of barely 100,000 people, but it still felt like</p>
<p>a small town and residents there were spooked.</p>
<p>When headlines about the brutal stabbing hit newspapers the day after the crime, Leeds</p>
<p>started flooding into the police department.</p>
<p>They were getting lots of tips, but there were some interesting ones.</p>
<p>There was a witness that saw somebody run into the north and somebody run into the east</p>
<p>at around that time because they were driving by.</p>
<p>This report of someone running away from the business school right around the time of the</p>
<p>murder piqued investigators&rsquo; interest.</p>
<p>But it never really led anywhere because it was raining the afternoon Ann was killed,</p>
<p>so there were lots of people running to and from buildings in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Police didn&rsquo;t have a good way of following this lead and it wasn&rsquo;t like they could question,</p>
<p>much less even track down every single person who might or might not have been leaving buildings</p>
<p>in the rain that afternoon.</p>
<p>The day after Ann&rsquo;s murder, right when the investigation felt like it was about to stall,</p>
<p>an important call came in.</p>
<p>A janitor in a nearby building had found blood.</p>
<p>I guess they&rsquo;ve come in and saw some blood on the water fountain in the basement there.</p>
<p>They think it was obviously connected.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know for sure if it was or not, but kind of coincidental that there would be a</p>
<p>murder just, what, two blocks away where a lot of blood was and then you get what looks</p>
<p>like possibly some cleanup or something in the basement of that 312 building.</p>
<p>What detective theory refers to as the 312 building was a building with some business</p>
<p>offices just a few blocks away from the old courthouse.</p>
<p>Now there wasn&rsquo;t a lot of blood, but there was a smear a few inches wide on a water fountain</p>
<p>downstairs in the building.</p>
<p>Luckily, the custodian who found the smear of blood did not clean it off.</p>
<p>He left it untouched so crime scene techs could respond and take scrapings of it as</p>
<p>evidence.</p>
<p>With the technology they had at the time, authorities tested the dried blood to see</p>
<p>if it was a match for Ann.</p>
<p>But they were unable to come to a definitive conclusion because it tested positive for</p>
<p>two types of different blood.</p>
<p>Knowing the blood type, it will narrow down some suspects.</p>
<p>We can eliminate 94% of people, but look at a city of 100,000 people, that&rsquo;s still a</p>
<p>lot of people that could be a suspect.</p>
<p>The blood smear felt like a huge clue in the case.</p>
<p>But with no science to be able to link it directly to the crime, police couldn&rsquo;t say</p>
<p>for sure that the water fountain blood was even connected to the murder.</p>
<p>But like detective theory said, it would be a wild coincidence if it wasn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Detectives interviewed people who worked in the 312 building to see if anyone had seen</p>
<p>a bloody person maybe going into the basement on the day Ann died, but those efforts turned</p>
<p>up nothing.</p>
<p>Like a lot of cases that have forensic evidence that predated DNA testing, the water fountain</p>
<p>blood scrapings were preserved with the hope that someday they would provide more information</p>
<p>to investigators.</p>
<p>Detectives continued to work the case and fielded more tips via phone calls, and their</p>
<p>diligence paid off.</p>
<p>A significant report from an Evansville pharmacist came in just days after the murder.</p>
<p>They claimed that someone covered in blood went into the Columbia Pharmacy.</p>
<p>The Columbia Pharmacy on Columbia Avenue was not far from downtown Evansville where the</p>
<p>murder took place.</p>
<p>There were two women that worked at Columbia Pharmacy and they said between 320 and 340,</p>
<p>which our crime happened around 3315, they said that and they gave a description of a</p>
<p>white male and he was around 30 years old that had blood on him and she knew what blood</p>
<p>looked like because she worked on a pig farm and then he was in the store and I don&rsquo;t remember</p>
<p>what he did in there but then he got in a blue car and left.</p>
<p>The employees told police that the man they&rsquo;d seen had bushy brown hair.</p>
<p>Detective DeYoung said that he couldn&rsquo;t tell from the case file whether or not the</p>
<p>women ever mentioned the strange man buying anything from the pharmacy.</p>
<p>The pharmacist said that the reason she hadn&rsquo;t reported the bloody man when he first walked</p>
<p>into her store was because she didn&rsquo;t want to assume the worst about him, but then she</p>
<p>heard about the murder so she felt like she needed to call and report the strange sighting.</p>
<p>The timeline of when the pharmacy workers had seen the man and described how he looked</p>
<p>made him highly suspicious to authorities, so police announced that they might be looking</p>
<p>for a white man in his 30s with bushy brown hair who was driving a blue car.</p>
<p>At the same time, detectives got to work digging through recent call logs to see if they&rsquo;d</p>
<p>responded to any incidents involving knives in the downtown area in recent weeks.</p>
<p>They found a report from days prior from a woman who said that she had encountered a</p>
<p>man downtown with a knife before Ann was killed, but she hadn&rsquo;t provided police with any</p>
<p>description of the guy, and the rest of her story didn&rsquo;t include a lot of detail.</p>
<p>A few weeks after Ann&rsquo;s murder, the dean of Lockyer Business College announced that</p>
<p>the school was offering up a $1,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of Ann&rsquo;s</p>
<p>killer.</p>
<p>He told the Evansville Courier that Ann was a well-liked teacher.</p>
<p>She had even been recognized in an annual awards program honoring teachers&rsquo; achievements</p>
<p>called Outstanding Educators of America.</p>
<p>Her students and co-workers loved her, and she received the recognition she deserved.</p>
<p>A few months before she was murdered, a newspaper in town ran a story about the award, which</p>
<p>showed a photo of Ann smiling above the article.</p>
<p>In another article that ran in the Evansville Courier on January 28th, the vice president</p>
<p>of Lockyer Business College said he hoped local businesses would pitch in and increase</p>
<p>the $1,000 reward for information.</p>
<p>The call to action worked, and the pot of money grew to $8,600 thanks to donations.</p>
<p>The college&rsquo;s VP told the Evansville Courier, quote,</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It seems strange to me that this could happen in the middle of the afternoon and</p>
<p>someone who has committed a brutal killing such as this could walk or run out of the</p>
<p>building without anyone noticing something unusual,&rsquo; end quote.</p>
<p>That feeling was shared by most of the people who were living in Evansville at the time.</p>
<p>By the start of 1974, the one-year anniversary of the murder loomed, and police were no closer</p>
<p>to narrowing in on Ann&rsquo;s killer.</p>
<p>The one saving grace that they hoped would send them in a new and productive direction</p>
<p>was getting the initial test results back from the hair and fingernail clippings that</p>
<p>the coroner had retrieved from Ann&rsquo;s body during her autopsy.</p>
<p>But when those test results came in, they showed that most of the hair found in Ann&rsquo;s</p>
<p>palms was hers, but one strand was not.</p>
<p>The problem was, police didn&rsquo;t know who this single strand belonged to.</p>
<p>They suspected it more than likely belonged to Ann&rsquo;s killer, but it wasn&rsquo;t like authorities</p>
<p>back in 1974 had the capability to extract DNA or any kind of pertinent information from</p>
<p>that piece of hair.</p>
<p>At the time, investigators weren&rsquo;t even able to determine if it belonged to a man</p>
<p>or a woman.</p>
<p>So after that, the investigation stalled for the rest of 1974, and the only information</p>
<p>coming into police was a random call here and there with very vague information.</p>
<p>There was a tip from an off-duty officer in Nashville, Tennessee, that said some guy was</p>
<p>bragging about murders and that he committed like three or four that he kind of overheard</p>
<p>and somehow this one came up.</p>
<p>Yeah, I know there was one tip from, it was like a soldier at Fort Campbell that had stabbed</p>
<p>a woman and whatever, military police called and gave us his information and then they</p>
<p>checked and he was actually locked up for something else at the time of Klein&rsquo;s murder.</p>
<p>1975 rolled around and the investigation had lost steam almost entirely.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s when another bizarre lead came in that sort of changed the trajectory of</p>
<p>the case.</p>
<p>Authorities learned from a woman who&rsquo;d called in that her ex-boyfriend, a man named Darrell,</p>
<p>had robbed a pharmacy in Evansville, not the Columbia Pharmacy, but another one, in late</p>
<p>1974.</p>
<p>She described Darrell as having bushy brown hair and during the early 70s, he had a history</p>
<p>of drug use and robbing stores and buildings in the Evansville area.</p>
<p>She told police that Darrell had been killed during the pharmacy robbery in 1974, but she</p>
<p>thought that they should look into him for Ann Klein&rsquo;s murder.</p>
<p>This information about Darrell, the pharmacy robbery, and him being shot during it was</p>
<p>not something police were familiar with.</p>
<p>They checked their records and sure enough, they found the report and realized that up</p>
<p>till that point, they had never put two and two together about Darrell.</p>
<p>Interestingly, he was killed on New Year&rsquo;s Eve of 74 when he was trying to rob a pharmacy</p>
<p>and the pharmacy worker, the pharmacist had a gun, I can&rsquo;t remember what kind of gun it</p>
<p>was, but he had a gun and shot and killed this guy trying to rob him.</p>
<p>And then we didn&rsquo;t even find out any of this stuff about him until 1975.</p>
<p>That leads us to, okay, now we&rsquo;ve got to sort through all this paperwork.</p>
<p>Is this guy been eliminated?</p>
<p>You know, what&rsquo;s his blood type at least?</p>
<p>Can we say, you know, someone with his blood type was at the scene?</p>
<p>Detectives started looking for physical evidence to tie Darrell to Ann&rsquo;s murder, but he died</p>
<p>a year before they even learned about him, so there wasn&rsquo;t much to get from him to compare</p>
<p>to the case.</p>
<p>So instead, they interviewed some of his friends who told detectives, oh yeah, Darrell might</p>
<p>have said something about killing that teacher and you know what?</p>
<p>I might have the murder weapon.</p>
<p>And there was another man who said that he had bragged to him and that&rsquo;s how we ended</p>
<p>up with the knife, that he had killed Ann Klein with that knife that we found.</p>
<p>And that was Darrell&rsquo;s knife?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>That he supposedly gave to this guy because this guy was looking for a weapon and he said,</p>
<p>here, take this one.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good killing knife.</p>
<p>Police took the knife from Darrell&rsquo;s friend as evidence and it remains with Evansville</p>
<p>PD today.</p>
<p>Even though Darrell had an extensive felony record when he was alive, his DNA was never</p>
<p>entered into any kind of database.</p>
<p>Back in the 70s, that wasn&rsquo;t required.</p>
<p>So technically, Darrell is still a suspect in Ann&rsquo;s murder, and until authorities can</p>
<p>get a DNA sample from him or one of his close relatives, detectives can&rsquo;t compare his genetic</p>
<p>profile to the evidence in Ann&rsquo;s case, like that single strand of hair or the flakes of</p>
<p>blood from the water fountain.</p>
<p>They would need a willing relative to give a DNA sample or a court order to exhume his</p>
<p>body, which they don&rsquo;t feel like they have enough probable cause for.</p>
<p>So for now, it&rsquo;s a waiting game.</p>
<p>Honestly, their best bet is for one of Darrell&rsquo;s relatives to come forward and help them out.</p>
<p>For years, police leaned really hard toward Darrell as being a likely suspect, but without</p>
<p>that concrete proof, they had to keep an open mind about the case.</p>
<p>Almost a decade later, in 1982, detectives took a report from a woman who had a story</p>
<p>completely unrelated to the Darrell theory.</p>
<p>This woman told police that right after Ann&rsquo;s murder, one of her tenants in an apartment</p>
<p>building that she managed in Evansville had paid his rent and then skipped town abruptly.</p>
<p>She felt at the time it was super odd, but she&rsquo;d never come forward to tell police about</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>When investigators asked the woman what the guy&rsquo;s name was, she told them.</p>
<p>Now, we&rsquo;ve changed his name for this episode because the man is still alive today.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll call him Nicholas.</p>
<p>She said that Nicholas had been a student of Ann&rsquo;s at Lockyer College.</p>
<p>Police immediately tried to follow up on this tip and track down Nicholas, but they</p>
<p>were unsuccessful.</p>
<p>I guess too much time had passed and they couldn&rsquo;t retrieve the school&rsquo;s old records</p>
<p>or this woman who was his landlord didn&rsquo;t have any further identifying information for</p>
<p>him.</p>
<p>But either way, the Nicholas lead fizzled pretty quickly, and it stayed dormant until</p>
<p>December 23rd, 2000, 18 years later.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when the name Nicholas popped up on investigators&rsquo; radar for a second time.</p>
<p>A clerk working in the Evansville Police Department records room picked up a phone</p>
<p>call and a man was on the other end of the line.</p>
<p>He introduced himself as Nicholas, a former student of Ann Klein&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>When Evansville police talked to Nicholas, they learned a lot from him that made them</p>
<p>scratch their heads.</p>
<p>He said he experienced blackouts and thinks he could have committed the murder.</p>
<p>Detectives wasted no time in following up on the man&rsquo;s statement, and they got on the</p>
<p>next flight to St. Petersburg, Florida, where he said he lived, to interview him.</p>
<p>Basically, everybody told the detective that he stabbed her 16 times and thought that she</p>
<p>was killed in the basement.</p>
<p>Nicholas was given a polygraph test to vet the story that he was giving to police, but</p>
<p>the results came back inconclusive.</p>
<p>The more pointed detectives got in their questioning, the more they began to realize that Nicholas</p>
<p>might be lying, or perhaps struggling with mental health issues.</p>
<p>He could not give really any specific details on it.</p>
<p>It was clear that it was pretty much fabricated, and he was claiming that he blacked out on</p>
<p>and off and doesn&rsquo;t really remember, but then, you know, would try and give other details</p>
<p>that were pretty much common knowledge.</p>
<p>There wasn&rsquo;t really any kind of clear motive, and then at one point he changed the story</p>
<p>and said he didn&rsquo;t kill anybody, and, you know, gets into this whole thing about blackouts,</p>
<p>and he just doesn&rsquo;t remember.</p>
<p>Investigators took DNA samples from Nicholas and strands of his hair and his fingerprints,</p>
<p>but after running those against the case evidence, nothing matched.</p>
<p>To everyone&rsquo;s disappointment, the case stalled again.</p>
<p>Then five years after Nicholas&rsquo;s out-of-the-blue half-confession, a woman from Texas called</p>
<p>and said she knew who killed Anne Klein.</p>
<p>For perspective, it&rsquo;s 2005 by this point.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been over 30 years since Anne was murdered, so tips and, honestly, people who were even</p>
<p>alive when the crime occurred are few and far between.</p>
<p>The woman on the phone claimed to have gone to church with another woman who used to live</p>
<p>in Evansville.</p>
<p>This woman claimed that she and B had been friends and that they attended the church,</p>
<p>the Mormon church together in Texas, and that B had disclosed to her that she killed Anne</p>
<p>Klein because she wasn&rsquo;t going to let Anne Klein have the man that she liked.</p>
<p>Detectives hopped on the next flight to Texas to find the woman, but when they got there</p>
<p>and interviewed her, she denied ever saying those things to her church friend, and she</p>
<p>willingly gave her DNA to be ruled out as a suspect.</p>
<p>The woman confirmed that back in 1973, she had been a student of Anne&rsquo;s, but she also</p>
<p>denied holding a jealous grudge against her former teacher.</p>
<p>I know if we have DNA that when we get new stuff or we get new things that could contain</p>
<p>DNA, it would automatically be compared against the known that we do know of.</p>
<p>And so I don&rsquo;t think we were ever able to obtain any hard evidence against the charger.</p>
<p>The theory of whether or not Anne had been having an affair, and whether it was the reason</p>
<p>behind her death, was definitely something police, even back in 1973, had considered</p>
<p>as a possibility.</p>
<p>And even though it would explain a lot about the brutal and personal nature of the murder,</p>
<p>they never found any evidence to support it.</p>
<p>But throw in rumors like the supposed confession at a church in Texas, and you can see why</p>
<p>police have always felt like they can&rsquo;t let a theory like that go.</p>
<p>According to investigators, that phone call was the only time they ever heard anyone suggest</p>
<p>an affair as a possible motive.</p>
<p>The next lead came in the form of a phone call in 2020, literally just two years ago.</p>
<p>A young woman called the Evansville Police Department and said that her boyfriend&rsquo;s</p>
<p>mother killed Anne Klein, and that her boyfriend was just a small boy at the time, but he and</p>
<p>one of his friends were there when the crime happened.</p>
<p>The tipster reported that her boyfriend&rsquo;s mother had been a student of Anne&rsquo;s in 1973</p>
<p>and had it out for her, though she didn&rsquo;t know why.</p>
<p>We got some more report cards and some enrollment forms, and I think we were able to confirm</p>
<p>that that woman was a student in one of Anne&rsquo;s classes.</p>
<p>Today, this tip remains a viable lead for investigators.</p>
<p>And as of this recording, Detective Theory and DeYoung are working to corroborate the</p>
<p>tip through interviews and evidence.</p>
<p>When technology changes, it&rsquo;s going to catch up to them, at least we hope so.</p>
<p>And that murders, I mean, they never go, just go away.</p>
<p>But you know, to me, this stuff matters because to somebody, this was their world.</p>
<p>This Anne Klein, she meant something to these people.</p>
<p>That was somebody&rsquo;s daughter, that was Robert&rsquo;s wife, I&rsquo;m sure she had best friends and really</p>
<p>close relatives.</p>
<p>Just because I didn&rsquo;t know her, but to somebody, she was their everything.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been 50 years.</p>
<p>Anne Klein deserves justice.</p>
<p>Her family deserves to know why she was killed and who her killer is.</p>
<p>Police might have a new suspect in mind, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean they don&rsquo;t still need</p>
<p>the public&rsquo;s help.</p>
<p>If you or someone you know has information about the murder of Anne Klein, please call</p>
<p>812-436-7979.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the main line to the Evansville Police Detective Unit, and it&rsquo;s staffed 24-7.</p>
<p>Maybe you have the missing piece of information that could finally close Anne&rsquo;s case forever.</p>
