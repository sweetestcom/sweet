    <p>The following is a conversation with David Buss,</p>
<p>evolutionary psychologist at UT Austin,</p>
<p>researching human sex differences in mate selection.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s considered one of the founders</p>
<p>of evolutionary psychology</p>
<p>and has authored many exciting and challenging books,</p>
<p>including The Evolution of Desire,</p>
<p>Strategies of Human Mating,</p>
<p>Bad Men, The Hidden Roots of Sexual Deception,</p>
<p>Harassment, and Assault,</p>
<p>and The Murderer Next Door,</p>
<p>Why the Mind is Designed to Kill.</p>
<p>We talk a lot about sex, dating, relationships, and love.</p>
<p>I take these, at times,</p>
<p>controversial topics very seriously,</p>
<p>but I also try to inject humor and ridiculousness</p>
<p>throughout this conversation and all conversations I do.</p>
<p>Please do not mistake my silliness for a lack of seriousness</p>
<p>and my seriousness for a lack of silliness.</p>
<p>And above all, do not mistake my suit and tie</p>
<p>or my PhD as a sign of intelligence or wisdom.</p>
<p>I barely know what I&rsquo;m talking about on most days.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m simply curious and hoping to understand</p>
<p>the way a child does,</p>
<p>what the heck is going on</p>
<p>in this weird and wonderful civilization of ours.</p>
<p>If I say something stupid, as I often do,</p>
<p>I promise to learn and to improve.</p>
<p>As Mark Twain said,</p>
<p>I do not want my schooling to interfere with my education.</p>
<p>Open-minded curiosity, I think,</p>
<p>is the best guide for a proper and fun lifelong education.</p>
<p>And now, a quick few second mention of each sponsor.</p>
<p>Check them out in the description.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the best way to support this podcast.</p>
<p>We got Notion for startups, ExpressVPN for privacy,</p>
<p>Roka for style, Onnit for supplements,</p>
<p>and Indeed for hiring.</p>
<p>Choose wisely, my friends.</p>
<p>And now, onto the full ad reads.</p>
<p>As always, no ads in the middle.</p>
<p>I try to make this interesting, but if you skip them,</p>
<p>please still check out our sponsors.</p>
<p>I enjoy their stuff, maybe you will too.</p>
<p>This show is brought to you by Notion,</p>
<p>a note-taking and team collaboration tool.</p>
<p>It combines note-taking, document sharing,</p>
<p>wikis, project management, and much more</p>
<p>into one space that&rsquo;s simple, powerful,</p>
<p>and beautifully designed.</p>
<p>A lot of people care a lot about note-taking</p>
<p>and talk to me a lot about it.</p>
<p>You know, I started back in the old school days</p>
<p>of Emacs and Vim.</p>
<p>Emacs was my weapon of choice.</p>
<p>But now, in the modern day, in the 21st century,</p>
<p>you gotta be using the best tools for note-taking.</p>
<p>Way better, way fancier than the old school Emacs.</p>
<p>Although, I should say Emacs still has a purpose.</p>
<p>And what everybody recommends,</p>
<p>what all the cool kids recommend,</p>
<p>if you look at what the top recommendation is</p>
<p>for note-taking, it&rsquo;s going to be Notion.</p>
<p>Now, Notion also wants me to tell you,</p>
<p>not just about their note-taking,</p>
<p>but the fact that it&rsquo;s awesome for startups.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a operating system, as they say,</p>
<p>for running every aspect of the company as it grows.</p>
<p>Notion is running a special offer just for startups.</p>
<p>You get up to $1,000 off of Notion&rsquo;s team plan</p>
<p>by going to notion.com slash startups.</p>
<p>To give you a sense, that&rsquo;s almost a year</p>
<p>of free Notion for a team of 10.</p>
<p>Go to notion.com slash startups.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s notion.com slash startups.</p>
<p>This show is also brought to you by ExpressVPN.</p>
<p>I use them, I&rsquo;ve used them for many years</p>
<p>to protect my privacy on the internet.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s three things I want to tell you about.</p>
<p>One, ISPs still track your data,</p>
<p>even if you go to all kinds of shady websites</p>
<p>using incognito mode, and I know you well.</p>
<p>I know you do that kind of thing.</p>
<p>You dirty dog, you.</p>
<p>The second thing you should know about</p>
<p>is you can change geographic locations</p>
<p>for shows like Netflix and Hulu, all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s useful.</p>
<p>My favorite thing is that the thing just works super fast,</p>
<p>which is what you would want from a good VPN.</p>
<p>It works fast, works on any device, any operating system.</p>
<p>Go to expressvpn.com slash LexPod</p>
<p>to get an extra three months free.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s expressvpn.com slash LexPod.</p>
<p>Did I mention it works on Linux?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the best and the most important operating system.</p>
<p>This show is also brought to you by Roka,</p>
<p>the makers of glasses and sunglasses</p>
<p>that I love wearing for their design, feel,</p>
<p>and innovation on material, optics, and grip.</p>
<p>Roka was started by two all-American swimmers from Stanford</p>
<p>and was born out of an obsession with performance.</p>
<p>Two words that I love, obsession in all walks of life</p>
<p>and performance in all walks of life.</p>
<p>But when you&rsquo;re talking about sunglasses,</p>
<p>what does that result in?</p>
<p>It results in a classy, sexy, minimalist, functional design.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re good at what they do.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s extremely lightweight.</p>
<p>The grip is comfortable but strong.</p>
<p>I run in them all the time.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re talking about in the Austin heat,</p>
<p>in the Boston cold, it works.</p>
<p>It looks good.</p>
<p>Check them out for both prescription glasses</p>
<p>and sunglasses at Roka.com and enter code Lex</p>

<p>This episode is brought to you by Onnit,</p>
<p>a nutrition, supplement, and fitness company.</p>
<p>They make AlphaBrain, you may have heard of that,</p>
<p>which is a nootropic that helps support memory,</p>
<p>mental speed, and focus.</p>
<p>I do deep work sessions.</p>
<p>You should read Cal Newport&rsquo;s deep work book</p>
<p>to understand what that means.</p>
<p>It means focusing for prolonged periods of time</p>
<p>in a single task and going to some deep, dark places</p>
<p>of struggle because your mind wants to be distracted.</p>
<p>Your mind wants to switch to another task</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t let it and that&rsquo;s what deep work is.</p>
<p>So before especially difficult sessions of this kind,</p>
<p>I will take an AlphaBrain.</p>
<p>It helps boost my thinking through a problem,</p>
<p>clears the mind, helps me maintain focus.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a nice super boost for the rocket</p>
<p>that is the human mind.</p>
<p>Anyway, go to LexFriedman.com slash Onnit</p>
<p>to get up to 10% off AlphaBrain.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s LexFriedman, my name, .com slash Onnit.</p>

<p>as the people you surround yourself with</p>
<p>and because most of us do most of the meaningful,</p>
<p>most of the wild, hardworking pursuits of our lives</p>
<p>at our work, it&rsquo;s important to surround yourself</p>

<p>Perhaps even more important,</p>
<p>those are the brothers and sisters that stand by your side</p>
<p>as you do some of the most difficult things in your life.</p>

<p>This is the Lex Friedman podcast</p>
<p>and here is my conversation with David Buss.</p>
<p>What is more important in the history</p>
<p>of the development of human civilization,</p>
<p>sex or violence?</p>
<p>So mating strategies or military strategies?</p>
<p>Oh, well, both are important.</p>
<p>I mean, first of all,</p>
<p>humans are a sexually reproducing species</p>
<p>and so everything has to go through sex.</p>
<p>So our mating psychology has to be very rich and complex</p>
<p>because to succeed, for us to be here now,</p>
<p>all of our ancestors in an unbroken chain</p>
<p>have had to succeed in selecting a fertile mate,</p>
<p>attracting that mate,</p>
<p>be mutually chosen by that mate,</p>
<p>stay together long enough,</p>
<p>do all the sexual things you need to do to reproduce,</p>
<p>have the kids survive, et cetera.</p>
<p>So everything has to go through mating.</p>
<p>And in that sense, I think it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>I mean, survival is really only a means to an end,</p>
<p>if you will.</p>
<p>So sex has got to be important</p>
<p>and humans have a very rich evolved sexual psychology</p>
<p>or an evolved mating psychology.</p>
<p>Okay, but I wouldn&rsquo;t minimize</p>
<p>the importance of violence either.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a ton of evidence that humans evolved</p>
<p>in the context of small groups</p>
<p>and with a fair amount of small group warfare.</p>
<p>So intertribal warfare where,</p>
<p>and this is a harsh realization,</p>
<p>but there historically,</p>
<p>this is part of our bad evolutionary history,</p>
<p>it has been advantageous</p>
<p>from a purely reproductive standpoint</p>
<p>to conquer a neighboring group,</p>
<p>kill the males and get whatever resources they have,</p>
<p>including females and sexual resources,</p>
<p>as well as tools, weapons, territory, and so forth.</p>
<p>And so I think that we have,</p>
<p>of course, it&rsquo;s typically males who do that.</p>
<p>I mean, yes, some females have participated in warfare,</p>
<p>but as far as I know,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s never been a single case</p>
<p>in all of human recorded history</p>
<p>of women forming a war tribe with other women</p>
<p>to attack another group of women</p>
<p>and kill them and capture the men as husbands.</p>
<p>But this phenomenon is common in the ethnographic record</p>
<p>and small group studies.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s part of our common thing.</p>
<p>So just one concrete example,</p>
<p>unfortunately, he&rsquo;s dead now.</p>
<p>He passed away, Napoleon Chagnon,</p>
<p>who studied the Yanomamo for many, many years.</p>
<p>When he first started interviewing them,</p>
<p>he asked them, why do you go to war?</p>
<p>And they said, well, to capture women, of course,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s the only sensible reason.</p>
<p>And they said, why does your culture go to war,</p>
<p>however they phrased it?</p>
<p>And he said, well, we go to war to spread democracy</p>
<p>and ideas and everything.</p>
<p>They basically fell off their logs laughing</p>
<p>at such a stupid reason,</p>
<p>because why risk your life for anything other than women?</p>
<p>Of course, it&rsquo;s more complex than that,</p>
<p>because some go to war for reputational reasons.</p>
<p>They say, if we don&rsquo;t retaliate,</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;ve been attacked</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ve stolen three of our women,</p>
<p>if we don&rsquo;t retaliate,</p>
<p>then we will get a reputation as exploitable,</p>
<p>and then other groups will start to attack us as well.</p>
<p>And so they get into these cycles of,</p>
<p>like the Hatfields and McCoys of attacks,</p>
<p>counterattacks, retribution,</p>
<p>and part of it is reputation management.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s between groups.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s been the primary source of violence,</p>
<p>but not the only source.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s also within-group conflict.</p>
<p>And so many ethnographies,</p>
<p>many traditional societies have things,</p>
<p>some of them are ritualized,</p>
<p>like wrestling matches,</p>
<p>or in the Anamama,</p>
<p>they have these, or used to,</p>
<p>these chest-pounding duels,</p>
<p>so if we&rsquo;re in this match,</p>
<p>you challenge me,</p>
<p>and I have to, of course-</p>
<p>Chest-pounding duel.</p>
<p>I like this.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not, you&rsquo;re not hitting each other,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just, it&rsquo;s like peacocking,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re really-</p>
<p>Oh, no, you&rsquo;re hitting each other.</p>
<p>Oh, sorry.</p>
<p>Yeah, so they get 20 paces away,</p>
<p>and they run up,</p>
<p>and you punch the other guy in the chest,</p>
<p>and he has to basically stand there,</p>
<p>and then he does the same to you.</p>
<p>Oh, wow.</p>
<p>And then it&rsquo;s basically last man standing.</p>
<p>Well, I suppose that&rsquo;s better than the face.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an interesting decision with the chest.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m sure if you get good at that kind of thing,</p>
<p>you could start breaking ribs,</p>
<p>and you can get loose about the rules</p>
<p>of where exactly in the chest you can hit.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s that guy who&rsquo;s always known</p>
<p>for hitting not exactly in the chest,</p>
<p>accidentally missing.</p>
<p>Right, right, the Mike Tyson of-</p>
<p>Exactly, eating your ear off.</p>
<p>So interesting.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s ritualized conflict,</p>
<p>to sort of purify the competition</p>
<p>that resolves some kind of issue.</p>
<p>Well, yeah, it&rsquo;s in part to establish status hierarchies.</p>
<p>But also, and here&rsquo;s just another,</p>
<p>one more concrete point on that.</p>
<p>The yanamama, we don&rsquo;t have this in our language.</p>
<p>We just have one word for kill or murder.</p>
<p>But yanamama have,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re either an una, if you&rsquo;re a male,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re an unokai or a non-unokai.</p>
<p>The non-unokai are men who have not killed.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re an unokai, that means you have killed someone.</p>
<p>And the unokai among the yanamama</p>
<p>historically had higher status and more wives.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re a polygynous society,</p>
<p>which has been true of something like 83 to 85%</p>
<p>of traditional societies.</p>
<p>Or actually, I was just corrected by an anthropologist.</p>
<p>She said, we no longer call them traditional societies.</p>
<p>We call them small-scale societies.</p>
<p>So nothing can be called traditional?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Is bacteria the traditional society?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think it&rsquo;s just one of these things,</p>
<p>the language, the words that are deemed appropriate</p>
<p>to use to describe things change over time.</p>
<p>Yeah, so words can hurt people.</p>
<p>They can inspire people.</p>
<p>Words are funny, powerful things.</p>
<p>You authored a textbook titled Evolutionary Psychology,</p>
<p>The New Science of Mind in its sixth edition.</p>
<p>What is the magic ingredient</p>
<p>that gave birth to homo sapiens, do you think?</p>
<p>Is it fire, cooking, ability to collaborate,</p>
<p>share ideas, ability to contemplate our own mortality,</p>
<p>all that kind of stuff?</p>
<p>Yeah, well, I think it&rsquo;s hard to isolate one factor.</p>
<p>I know you&rsquo;ve had Richard Wrangham on this podcast.</p>
<p>It was a wonderful, wonderful interview.</p>
<p>And he used to be a colleague of mine</p>
<p>when I was a professor at Michigan.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve stayed in touch with him on and off.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a brilliant, brilliant guy.</p>
<p>And he thinks fire and cooking</p>
<p>have been one of the key things.</p>
<p>But I think it&rsquo;s hard to isolate.</p>
<p>I would trace at least part of our uniqueness</p>
<p>to the uniqueness of our mating system.</p>
<p>So we have in mating,</p>
<p>unlike chimpanzees, who are our closest primate relative,</p>
<p>and of which Richard Wrangham is a world&rsquo;s expert,</p>
<p>but they have basically no long-term pair-bonded mating.</p>
<p>Female comes into estrus, all the mating,</p>
<p>all the sex happens.</p>
<p>Most of the sex happens during that window.</p>
<p>But humans have evolved long-term pair-bonded mating.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s only one mating strategy,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a really important one.</p>
<p>And then you have with that male parental care.</p>
<p>So basically, again, you go back to chimps.</p>
<p>And chimps, with whom we share more than 98% of our DNA,</p>
<p>males don&rsquo;t do anything.</p>
<p>So they inseminate the females.</p>
<p>But then when the kids are born,</p>
<p>they basically don&rsquo;t do much of anything</p>
<p>in terms of provisioning and so forth.</p>
<p>But human males do.</p>
<p>We invest, in the modern environment,</p>
<p>could be decades, especially with the boomerang kids</p>
<p>and everything, but we&rsquo;re, not all males do,</p>
<p>but compared to the vast majority of mammals,</p>
<p>we are a very heavy male parental investment species.</p>
<p>Could you, if it&rsquo;s okay,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll ask you a bunch of dumb basic questions,</p>
<p>because those are fun.</p>
<p>Could you define mating here?</p>
<p>Does mating refer to the series of sexual acts</p>
<p>that lead to reproduction?</p>
<p>Does it include dating and love and camaraderie,</p>
<p>loyalty, all those things?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>When I first started studying it, yeah, I don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>when I first started studying it,</p>
<p>I looked for the right term.</p>
<p>And obviously, it&rsquo;s much broader than sex.</p>
<p>So by mating, I include things like mate selection,</p>
<p>mate preferences, mate attraction, mate retention,</p>
<p>mate poaching, mate expulsion.</p>
<p>Mate poaching, that sounds fun.</p>
<p>So the early, the game theoretic strategy,</p>
<p>mate selection is primary what mating is about,</p>
<p>or do you include the long-term,</p>
<p>once you agree that you&rsquo;re gonna stick this out</p>
<p>for a while and have multiple children,</p>
<p>is that also mating?</p>
<p>Yes, I include that as well.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a broad definition,</p>
<p>and absolutely includes the emotion of love.</p>
<p>And of course, there are many different types of love,</p>
<p>brotherly love, love of parents for children.</p>
<p>But love, I think, and this is one of the shifts</p>
<p>in the social sciences.</p>
<p>So when I was an undergraduate, for example,</p>
<p>I was taught that love is this invention</p>
<p>by some Caucasian European poets a couple hundred years ago.</p>
<p>And it turns out that&rsquo;s not the case.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s been extensive cross-cultural evidence now</p>
<p>that people, not every person in all cultures, of course,</p>
<p>but some people in all cultures experience this emotion</p>
<p>that we call love.</p>
<p>And for the word love,</p>
<p>are we going to, in this conversation,</p>
<p>try to stick to sort of romantic love</p>
<p>for the meaning of the word love?</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s a great question.</p>
<p>But I mean, it&rsquo;s pretty well established</p>
<p>that there are these different phases of love.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s this infatuation phase</p>
<p>where our psychology, we get obsessional thoughts.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to focus on work when we&rsquo;re not with the person</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re thinking about, the other person constantly.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s kind of like ideational intrusion</p>
<p>into our psychology, but you can&rsquo;t sustain that.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;d be, and then of course there&rsquo;s a,</p>
<p>pardon the phrase, but what I described</p>
<p>is the fucking like bunnies phase</p>
<p>of this intense sexuality.</p>
<p>But people have other adaptive problems they have to solve.</p>
<p>And so you can&rsquo;t stay in that state for too long.</p>
<p>And so that subsides over time and develops into,</p>
<p>at least in many cases, this warm attachment.</p>
<p>Cuddling bunnies, long-term cuddling bunnies phase</p>
<p>of the relationship, but still romantic,</p>
<p>not like brotherly love or,</p>
<p>because I talk about love a lot.</p>
<p>And for me, love is a broader experience</p>
<p>of just experiencing the joy and the beauty of life.</p>
<p>So like just looking out in nature,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the kind of love, like whatever the chemicals</p>
<p>that lead to a feeling that at least echoes</p>
<p>the same kind of feeling that you get with romantic love,</p>
<p>you can experience that with even inanimate objects.</p>
<p>That sounds weird to say, but just gratitude</p>
<p>and appreciation, not in some kind of a weird Zen way,</p>
<p>but just in a very human way.</p>
<p>Just, it feels good to be alive kind of.</p>
<p>It feels good to be alive kind of.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>I guess I would, I mean, that&rsquo;s an interesting thought.</p>
<p>I hadn&rsquo;t thought about that.</p>
<p>I guess I would use other terms to describe that.</p>
<p>So like the term awe, for example,</p>
<p>when you see a beautiful sunset,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why I kind of started out by saying,</p>
<p>I think there are different types of love</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m focusing on the mating type.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll talk about that, but so yeah,</p>
<p>there is a sense of beauty and there&rsquo;s a sense</p>
<p>of sexual appeal, maybe that&rsquo;s a good,</p>
<p>and those intersect in fascinating ways.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll talk about that.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll talk about all of that,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re saying mating strategies,</p>
<p>not that we&rsquo;ve kind of placed ourself,</p>
<p>what we mean by mating.</p>
<p>Mating strategies is one of the cool features</p>
<p>that made humans what they are.</p>
<p>One of the initial inventions is the weird,</p>
<p>weird and wonderful ways that we mate.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I mean, if you go to even things</p>
<p>like how we compete for mates,</p>
<p>and this is another kind of strange,</p>
<p>for some people, angle on it,</p>
<p>but mating is inherently a competitive process</p>
<p>in that desirable mates are in scarce supply</p>
<p>relative to the numbers of people who want them.</p>
<p>And so even post-mating, that is after mate selection,</p>
<p>mate attraction and mutual mate choice,</p>
<p>desirable, that&rsquo;s why there&rsquo;s mate poaching.</p>
<p>Mate poaching is one of the strategies</p>
<p>that we in my lab with David Schmidt have studied.</p>
<p>And so, okay, but one of the unique aspects of humans</p>
<p>is that we compete using language.</p>
<p>And that is we have reputations</p>
<p>and humans devote a lot of effort</p>
<p>to maintaining the reputations,</p>
<p>to building the reputations,</p>
<p>to trying to recover reputations</p>
<p>after a loss of reputation for various reasons.</p>
<p>But we compete for mates using language,</p>
<p>and that includes sending signals</p>
<p>to the person that we&rsquo;re trying to attract using language,</p>
<p>verbal fluency, and, you know,</p>
<p>obviously some more recent things like poetry.</p>
<p>But also we use language to derogate our competitors.</p>
<p>So one of the papers I published very early on,</p>
<p>it was a research project on derogation of competitors,</p>
<p>the ways in which people impugn the status,</p>
<p>character, and reputations of their rivals</p>
<p>with the goal of making them less desirable to other people.</p>
<p>And humans do that, and women and men both do that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an interesting thing that we&rsquo;re,</p>
<p>male competition, we were talking about the Yanomamo earlier</p>
<p>and some of these overt, physical,</p>
<p>or what animal biologists call contest competition,</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s a physical battle.</p>
<p>Males do that, and so a lot of the early attention</p>
<p>on mate competition was focused on</p>
<p>these sort of ostentatious, overt battles</p>
<p>in contest competition.</p>
<p>But we compete through language,</p>
<p>and so there&rsquo;s this big overlooked domain of women,</p>
<p>the ways in which women compete with each other</p>
<p>using language.</p>
<p>And one of the things that astonished me</p>
<p>is how observant women are about the subtle imperfections</p>
<p>in their rivals and take pains to point them out.</p>
<p>So just as a random example, I went to a party,</p>
<p>this is back in my youth, but went to a party</p>
<p>with my girlfriend at the time,</p>
<p>and I got into this conversation with another woman</p>
<p>who happened to be very attractive.</p>
<p>But then we leave the party, and she said something</p>
<p>just casually offhanded, like, she said,</p>
<p>did you notice that her thighs were heavy?</p>
<p>And I hadn&rsquo;t, but next time I saw this other woman,</p>
<p>I found my attention being drawn to check out her thigh.</p>
<p>Well, and originally it puzzled me</p>
<p>why women would derogate other women on appearance.</p>
<p>Well, they do it, of course,</p>
<p>because men prioritize appearance.</p>
<p>But I thought, well, the man can see the woman directly</p>
<p>with his own eyes.</p>
<p>Why would verbal input alter his perceptions</p>
<p>of how attractive he was?</p>
<p>And I think that part of it is,</p>
<p>I think there are actually two quick answers to that.</p>
<p>One is the attentional one.</p>
<p>So our attentional field, when they draw attention to it,</p>
<p>those what could be very small deviations</p>
<p>from perfect symmetry or whatever they are</p>
<p>become magnified in our attentional field.</p>
<p>But the other is that who we have as a mate</p>
<p>is also a reflection of our own status.</p>
<p>And you saw this in a kind of overt and way</p>
<p>in the earlier, the last presidential,</p>
<p>not the last, the 2016 presidential election</p>
<p>where Donald Trump was saying,</p>
<p>this was when he was in competition with Ted Cruz,</p>
<p>I think, in the primary.</p>
<p>He said, look at my wife, look at Ted Cruz&rsquo;s wife.</p>
<p>And he really impugned the appearance of Ted Cruz&rsquo;s wife</p>
<p>so using language, you can alter the dynamics</p>
<p>of the social hierarchy, the status hierarchy, sorry.</p>
<p>So like you can change the values subtly</p>
<p>or if you have a large platform in big ways,</p>
<p>you can move things around just with your words.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, that&rsquo;s right, right.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s fascinating with humans</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s all socially constructed anyway.</p>
<p>So this, I mean, the question I have is you said</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s the interesting thing about mating strategies</p>
<p>is there&rsquo;s a small pool of desirable mates.</p>
<p>And what the word desirable means is socially defined</p>
<p>almost by on purpose to make sure</p>
<p>the pool always stays small.</p>
<p>I would have a couple thoughts on that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an interesting issue, set of issues you raise.</p>
<p>Okay, one is that I think we have evolved adaptations.</p>
<p>Part of our psychology is to detect differences.</p>
<p>And so this is why like a, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>a Martian or an alien coming down,</p>
<p>they might look at humans and say,</p>
<p>boy, they all look alike.</p>
<p>Just like we look at, I don&rsquo;t know, zebras or whatever</p>
<p>and we think they all look alike.</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s important in decision-making,</p>
<p>especially in the mating domain or even friendship domain</p>
<p>or coalitional selection domain is the differences.</p>
<p>And so I noticed this just a concrete example of this.</p>
<p>I was sitting around, this is again, ages ago,</p>
<p>watching something like a Miss America beauty contest</p>
<p>and people in there with a bunch of other people</p>
<p>and they were saying, boy, did you see Miss North Carolina?</p>
<p>What a dog.</p>
<p>And so this is astonishing.</p>
<p>So here are like 50 contestants who are selected</p>
<p>as the most attractive in their state, presumably.</p>
<p>Although they claim it&rsquo;s based on talent.</p>
<p>But we noticed the differences.</p>
<p>And this is why I would push back a little bit</p>
<p>on the term socially constructed,</p>
<p>because I think it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>there are many different meanings of that phrase.</p>
<p>And one meaning that some people have,</p>
<p>one connotation is that it&rsquo;s arbitrary.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s arbitrary.</p>
<p>So this has been another shift</p>
<p>in understanding standards of beauty</p>
<p>where it used to be believed in the social sciences.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t judge a book by its cover.</p>
<p>Beauty is only skin deep.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t judge people on the superficial characteristics.</p>
<p>But in fact, physical appearance provides</p>
<p>a wealth of information about the health status</p>
<p>of someone they&rsquo;re, in the case of males,</p>
<p>their physical formability.</p>
<p>And we have formability assessment adaptations,</p>
<p>and then fertility as well.</p>
<p>So there are a very predictable set of cues to fertility</p>
<p>that have evolved to be part of our</p>
<p>standards of attractiveness.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re not arbitrary.</p>
<p>There are some culturally arbitrary ones.</p>
<p>So like you go to the Maori in New Zealand, for example,</p>
<p>and they find tattoos on their lips to be very attractive.</p>
<p>So there are some culturally arbitrary things.</p>
<p>But standards of beauty like cues to youth,</p>
<p>cues to health in women, clear skin, full lips,</p>
<p>clear eyes, lustrous hair, a small waist-hip ratio</p>
<p>that is a circumference of the waist relative to the hips</p>
<p>is a cue to youth and fertility and a cue to health.</p>
<p>Symmetrical features.</p>
<p>So we are a bilaterally symmetrical species,</p>
<p>but we all have deviations from perfect symmetry</p>
<p>that are due to different things.</p>
<p>Mutation, load, environmental insults,</p>
<p>diseases during development, and so forth.</p>
<p>All right, but that&rsquo;s kind of deeply biological.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s cues that indicate something</p>
<p>that is biologically true about a particular human.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ll talk about both men and women.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re now talking about what men want</p>
<p>in the mating strategies when they look at women.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re saying small waist to hip ratio.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>How much of that is our deep biological past</p>
<p>on top of which you can build</p>
<p>all kinds of different standards of beauty?</p>
<p>So we have many things going on in our brain.</p>
<p>Our value of other humans in selecting a mate</p>
<p>might incorporate a lot more variables</p>
<p>as we get into the 21st century.</p>
<p>So how quickly does our valuation of a mate evolve</p>
<p>relative to the evolution of the human species?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re using evolve in the sense of culturally evolved?</p>
<p>Culturally evolved, and then relative to biologically evolved.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, I think that there are some things</p>
<p>that are biologically evolved,</p>
<p>some standards of attractiveness.</p>
<p>And there are some of the things that I mentioned.</p>
<p>So in male evaluation of females,</p>
<p>let me back up and just say,</p>
<p>what is the underlying logic?</p>
<p>Why would we have standards of attractiveness?</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s the interesting thing,</p>
<p>and this gets back to your earlier question</p>
<p>about what is unique to humans,</p>
<p>or what distinguishes us,</p>
<p>or what set us off on the path that we did,</p>
<p>is chimpanzee males do not have any difficulty</p>
<p>figuring out when a female is fertile.</p>
<p>She signals that like crazy</p>
<p>with the bright red genital swelling,</p>
<p>olfactory cues, she goes into estrus.</p>
<p>In humans, we have, and this was actually a third thing</p>
<p>that I wanted to add earlier,</p>
<p>we have concealed ovulation, okay?</p>
<p>Relatively concealed ovulation,</p>
<p>which is remarkable given how close we are</p>
<p>primatologically to chimpanzees.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s a little bit of evidence</p>
<p>that there are subtle changes that occur</p>
<p>when women ovulate,</p>
<p>non-women not on hormonal contraceptives.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s mostly concealed.</p>
<p>But it is largely concealed.</p>
<p>Do you think that&rsquo;s a feature or a bug?</p>
<p>Like do we evolve that,</p>
<p>is that a powerful invention for the human species?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s an adaptation in women,</p>
<p>that women have evolved concealed ovulation.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s a feature, not a bug.</p>
<p>Would it give more power for women to select a mate?</p>
<p>There are a couple different hypotheses</p>
<p>about it, but the one that I think is most plausible</p>
<p>is that, again, comparing it to chimps,</p>
<p>female goes into estrus,</p>
<p>the male just has to try to monopolize her</p>
<p>while she&rsquo;s in that estrus phase,</p>
<p>and then they basically ignore the females after that.</p>
<p>If you can&rsquo;t know when a woman is fertile,</p>
<p>then you have to stick around a lot longer.</p>
<p>And so I think long-term pair bonding co-evolved</p>
<p>with concealed ovulation.</p>
<p>And with that, also, a very different form of sexuality,</p>
<p>which is that we have sex throughout the ovulatory cycle.</p>
<p>And chimps don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a little bit of mating,</p>
<p>a little bit of sex toward the edges of the estrus cycle,</p>
<p>but very little.</p>
<p>So that actually makes mating a more fundamental part</p>
<p>of interaction between humans than it does for chimps.</p>
<p>So meaning like year-round, every day,</p>
<p>constantly selecting mates in terms of biologically speaking.</p>
<p>So what else do men want, today in the 21st century</p>
<p>versus in the caveman days?</p>
<p>A wonderful question.</p>
<p>To answer it, though, I have to distinguish</p>
<p>between long-term mating and short-term mating.</p>
<p>And in long-term mating, it gets very complicated.</p>
<p>So as a-</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one way to put it, yeah.</p>
<p>Well, so I teach a course in human sexuality</p>
<p>at University of Texas at Austin.</p>
<p>And one of the things, this is back in the days</p>
<p>when there were chalkboards and you taught</p>
<p>with a piece of chalk and wrote things on the board.</p>
<p>And what I would do is I would ask the class,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d teach this large class, one to 200,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say, what do women want?</p>
<p>Tell me all the things women want in a long-term mate.</p>
<p>And so I would start at one end of the blackboard,</p>
<p>there were like five blackboards,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;d say, well, I want a mate who&rsquo;s kind,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s understanding, who&rsquo;s intelligent, who&rsquo;s healthy,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s got a good sense of humor, who shares my values.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d just go, and I&rsquo;d fill out five blackboards</p>
<p>and then run out of space.</p>
<p>And so first, this large number of characteristics</p>
<p>that people want, and then specific magnitudes</p>
<p>of those characteristics or amounts.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;d say, you want a mate who&rsquo;s, say, generous</p>
<p>with their resources.</p>
<p>And they say, yes, I want a mate who&rsquo;s generous</p>
<p>with their resources.</p>
<p>So I said, so like a guy who,</p>
<p>this is in women&rsquo;s mate selection,</p>
<p>a guy who at the end of every month gets his paycheck</p>
<p>and gives it to the local wino on the drag.</p>
<p>And I just go, well, no, not that generous, okay?</p>
<p>Generous toward me, not indiscriminately generous.</p>
<p>And so you want a mate who&rsquo;s ambitious,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s a hard worker.</p>
<p>Yes, but not a workaholic, and so then you get</p>
<p>to interactions among different characteristics.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a lot of characteristics, a lot of variables</p>
<p>in this very complex optimization problem for women.</p>
<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>And more so for women than for men.</p>
<p>So and then I turn to the men and I say,</p>
<p>well, what do men want?</p>
<p>And then I run out of space after about a blackboard</p>
<p>and a half, because they can&rsquo;t think of anything else.</p>
<p>So women-</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a lot of explanations for that.</p>
<p>Besides the lack of the number of variables, it&rsquo;s also,</p>
<p>you know, I mean, that&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the difference between the variables?</p>
<p>So on the men&rsquo;s side, what are the variables?</p>
<p>Well, in long-term mate selection,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of overlap.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>So things like intelligence, good health,</p>
<p>sense of humor, an agreeable personality,</p>
<p>someone who&rsquo;s not too neurotic or moody</p>
<p>or emotionally volatile, but there are key differences</p>
<p>as well, and the differences stem from,</p>
<p>they basically fall in the delimited number of domains.</p>
<p>So for men, it&rsquo;s physical attractiveness,</p>
<p>physical appearance, and youth are the two real big ones.</p>
<p>Okay, men prioritize those more than women do.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s why you have phenomena such as this quote,</p>
<p>love at first sight, where sometimes men can walk</p>
<p>into a party and they see a woman across the room</p>
<p>and they say, I&rsquo;m gonna marry that woman.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the woman for me.</p>
<p>Women very rarely do that.</p>
<p>Now, most men don&rsquo;t do that either,</p>
<p>but men are much more inclined to fall in love</p>
<p>at first sight.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s because they prioritize physical appearance.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because physical appearance provides this wealth</p>
<p>of information about a woman&rsquo;s fertility status.</p>
<p>And this is from an evolutionary perspective,</p>
<p>from a purely reproductive perspective,</p>
<p>in business school, they would call it job one.</p>
<p>Job one is you have to select a fertile mate.</p>
<p>So those who, in our evolutionary past,</p>
<p>who selected infertile mates,</p>
<p>so postmenopausal women, for example,</p>
<p>did not become our ancestors.</p>
<p>So we are all the descendants of this long</p>
<p>and unbroken chain of ancestors,</p>
<p>all of whom succeeded in selecting a fertile mate.</p>
<p>But fertility cannot be observed directly.</p>
<p>It can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Use some cues.</p>
<p>Exactly, and there are cues that are probabilistically</p>
<p>related to this underlying quality of fertility</p>
<p>that we can&rsquo;t observe directly.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re doing that computation in our heads.</p>
<p>What about men?</p>
<p>What do men want for short-term mating?</p>
<p>Well, so for short-term mating, for both sexes,</p>
<p>physical appearance looms very large.</p>
<p>So women are, no, physical attractiveness and appearance,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re important for women in long-term mate selection.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t wanna mislead anyone on that.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just not as important as they are for men.</p>
<p>And so a lot of characteristics come for women</p>
<p>before physical appearance, physical attractiveness.</p>
<p>So women, so if we switch to women,</p>
<p>what do women want?</p>
<p>They want also physical appearance for short-term mating,</p>
<p>physical attractiveness.</p>
<p>What else?</p>
<p>Some cues that represent physical attractiveness</p>
<p>that maybe represent health.</p>
<p>Well, here&rsquo;s, this is your, it&rsquo;s-</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m learning a lot here.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, so, but you&rsquo;re also asking</p>
<p>a very interesting question about what is controversial</p>
<p>within the evolutionary psychology field, right?</p>
<p>And not totally resolved, so-</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why you&rsquo;re on the sixth edition of the book,</p>
<p>and there could be a lot more editions coming.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, I revise it every four years or so</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s four years of new, interesting work,</p>
<p>and so it deserves updating.</p>
<p>But the traditional, I should say,</p>
<p>answer to your question is that women go for good genes,</p>
<p>cues to good genes in the short-term,</p>
<p>and cues to resources in the long-term.</p>
<p>And this has been a hypothesis that advocated,</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t come up with this one,</p>
<p>by Steve Gangestad, a former student of mine,</p>
<p>Marty Hale, Randy Thornhill,</p>
<p>and some other very smart players in the field.</p>
<p>And what they used as markers of good genes</p>
<p>are things like symmetrical features and masculine features.</p>
<p>So strong jawline, high shoulder-to-hip ratio,</p>
<p>you know, other sorts of masculine features.</p>
<p>But I started to doubt this explanation</p>
<p>for what women want in the short-term</p>
<p>because of some other findings.</p>
<p>So for women, a lot of short-term mating</p>
<p>is not one-night-stand mating,</p>
<p>but rather it&rsquo;s affair mating.</p>
<p>So if you ask the question, why do women have affairs?</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s restrict the question for the moment.</p>
<p>My colleagues would argue, well, women have affairs</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re trying to get good genes from one guy</p>
<p>while they&rsquo;re getting investment</p>
<p>from the regular partner, the husband.</p>
<p>Okay, but the problem is that when women have affairs,</p>
<p>70-plus percent tend to fall in love with</p>
<p>or become attached to their affair partner.</p>
<p>Now-</p>
<p>Oh, sorry, what percentage?</p>
<p>70?</p>
<p>Yeah, 70-</p>
<p>Some large majority.</p>
<p>Yeah, 70% or more.</p>
<p>In contrast to men, where it&rsquo;s more like 30%</p>
<p>of men who have affairs fall in love with</p>
<p>or become attached to their affair partner.</p>
<p>So, but from a design perspective,</p>
<p>an engineering perspective, if you will,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a disastrous thing</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re just trying to get good genes.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re trying to retain the investment</p>
<p>of one guy while getting good genes surreptitiously</p>
<p>from this guy who presumably has one.</p>
<p>Falling in love with them, becoming attached,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not a feature you want.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s bad engineering.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly, it&rsquo;s bad engineering.</p>
<p>And so I developed an alternative hypothesis</p>
<p>that I call the mate-switching hypothesis,</p>
<p>which is that affairs are one way</p>
<p>in which women divest themselves</p>
<p>of a cost-inflicting partner</p>
<p>or a partner who things aren&rsquo;t working out well with.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a way to either transition back</p>
<p>into the mating market</p>
<p>or to trade up in the mating market.</p>
<p>And so, anyway, so these are probably</p>
<p>the two leading hypotheses about why women have affairs.</p>
<p>And I am putting my money</p>
<p>on the mate-switching hypothesis.</p>
<p>My esteemed colleagues are putting their money</p>
<p>on the good genes hypothesis,</p>
<p>but I think the evidence for the good genes hypothesis</p>
<p>is starting to look shakier than initially.</p>
<p>Well, this is a heated debate.</p>
<p>I mean, mate-switching sounds like a,</p>
<p>so from a game theory perspective,</p>
<p>from an engineering perspective,</p>
<p>it seems to make a lot more sense</p>
<p>unless you put a lot of value in lifelong,</p>
<p>sort of in the long-term mating,</p>
<p>some kind of value in the lifelong singular relationship,</p>
<p>like monogamy.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And maybe we do, psychologically.</p>
<p>Maybe there&rsquo;s a big evolutionary advantage to that.</p>
<p>And we do, but we also know that divorce is,</p>
<p>you know, and breakups are also common</p>
<p>and occur in all cultures.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s-</p>
<p>Yeah, we&rsquo;re just not very good at this thing.</p>
<p>Well, either we&rsquo;re not good at the mate selection,</p>
<p>such that maybe we&rsquo;re not incorporating</p>
<p>all the variables well,</p>
<p>or we&rsquo;re just not good at monogamy, period,</p>
<p>from an evolutionary perspective.</p>
<p>Well, I think there, that&rsquo;s-</p>
<p>Another debate?</p>
<p>No, that raises an interesting set of questions.</p>
<p>So I think that, I mean, one issue is longevity.</p>
<p>So, I mean, we didn&rsquo;t live to be 70, 80 years old</p>
<p>in over 99% of human evolutionary history.</p>
<p>And so we didn&rsquo;t necessarily evolve</p>
<p>to be mated monogamously with one person</p>
<p>for decades and decades and decades.</p>
<p>But I also think that long-term pair bonding</p>
<p>is a critical strategy,</p>
<p>but mate switching is also a critical strategy.</p>
<p>So if you have a mate, for example,</p>
<p>who becomes cost-inflicting</p>
<p>or becomes sufficiently debilitated</p>
<p>or who suffers an injury such that,</p>
<p>like in hunter-gatherer societies</p>
<p>where the mate can no longer hunt,</p>
<p>can no longer provide resources</p>
<p>for their kids and the woman,</p>
<p>this becomes a problem.</p>
<p>And so I think that we have adaptations to mate switch</p>
<p>to divest ourselves from some partners</p>
<p>and trade up in the mating market</p>
<p>under certain conditions.</p>
<p>So, okay.</p>
<p>And those conditions will differ for men and women.</p>
<p>What are some of the cues in terms of what women want?</p>
<p>You know, I go to the gym.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a hotly contested debate.</p>
<p>You said evolutionary psychology,</p>
<p>and this is in the bro psychology forums</p>
<p>that I visit multiple times a day.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m just kidding.</p>
<p>Well, what&rsquo;s the most important cue of appearance for guys?</p>
<p>What muscle group is the most important to work on?</p>
<p>Do women care about biceps is what I&rsquo;m asking.</p>
<p>In terms of physical appearance,</p>
<p>a good shoulder to hip ratio,</p>
<p>so relatively wide shoulders relative to hips is one.</p>
<p>Women tend to prefer men who are physically fit</p>
<p>and well-toned, but not muscle bound.</p>
<p>So like if you go to, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>someone like those early,</p>
<p>when Arnold Schwarzenegger was doing the Mr.</p>
<p>whatever it was contest,</p>
<p>you see the women don&rsquo;t find those attractive,</p>
<p>the extremely muscle bound guys,</p>
<p>but they like a guy who&rsquo;s physically fit,</p>
<p>high shoulder to hip ratio.</p>
<p>They like guys who are physically taller than they are</p>
<p>and guys who are a bit above average in height.</p>
<p>So if the average, so if, you know,</p>
<p>the average is, I don&rsquo;t know, five, nine, five, 10,</p>
<p>and out there for humans, depending on the culture,</p>
<p>women prefer an inch or two taller than that.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>So shoulders, height, dad bod, what&rsquo;s that about?</p>
<p>Why do you want a dad bod?</p>
<p>Why do you, why not, how do I define dad bod?</p>
<p>What is a dad bod?</p>
<p>Dad bod is not muscle bound.</p>
<p>Okay, so out of shape.</p>
<p>A little, no, no, just a little bit.</p>
<p>A little bit of a cushion for the pushing.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what the kids call it these days,</p>
<p>but just a little bit, a little bit of fat.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s, why do they not want guys</p>
<p>to be obsessed with their body?</p>
<p>Is that, or is that some evolutionary thing?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think that women might interpret a guy</p>
<p>who is so obsessed with his body that he&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>they might view that as a sign of darn narcissism.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not a good trait.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>What about like cultures where large,</p>
<p>sort of overweight men are valued?</p>
<p>Is that, how do you explain,</p>
<p>like how much can we override the evolutionary desires</p>
<p>with our sort of cultural fashions of the day</p>
<p>that maybe represent other desirable aspects like wealth?</p>
<p>Well, wealth is, resources have always been important,</p>
<p>especially to women.</p>
<p>So is a man able to acquire resources</p>
<p>and is he willing to dispense them to her and her kids?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s always important in traditional cultures</p>
<p>that boils down to hunting skills.</p>
<p>So if, so I asked a colleague, friend, Kim Hill,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s probably the world&rsquo;s leading expert</p>
<p>on the Ache of Paraguay.</p>
<p>And you ask him like, what leads to high status</p>
<p>in the Ache in males, hunting skills.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the one thing, the big variable.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s resources.</p>
<p>Now, what&rsquo;s interesting about modern culture</p>
<p>is we have cash economies,</p>
<p>but cash economies are relatively recent.</p>
<p>And historically, there&rsquo;s over the vast,</p>
<p>99% of human evolutionary history,</p>
<p>you weren&rsquo;t able to stockpile resources</p>
<p>in the way that you are today.</p>
<p>Although there are interestingly certain ways you can do it.</p>
<p>So like you kill a large game animal,</p>
<p>okay, you bring it back, you get some status points</p>
<p>because you give some to your family,</p>
<p>you can share it more widely with the group, et cetera.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s gonna go bad, right?</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t just say, I&rsquo;m gonna keep this carcass around</p>
<p>for the next several months.</p>
<p>Okay, but, and I think it&rsquo;s a Steve Pinker</p>
<p>who might&rsquo;ve used coin this phrase</p>
<p>that they store the meat in the bodies of other people.</p>
<p>And so for example, they store it in their friends.</p>
<p>So, hunting success is,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a hit or miss kind of thing.</p>
<p>So you might come back empty handed four times out of five,</p>
<p>but when you do, you share your meat with others.</p>
<p>And then when, and then they reciprocate</p>
<p>by sharing their meat with you.</p>
<p>And so you can store resources in the bodies of other people,</p>
<p>which is I think an interesting way to think about it,</p>
<p>but that can only go so far.</p>
<p>And when you have cash economies,</p>
<p>you have both the ability to stockpile resources,</p>
<p>but also this kind of explosion</p>
<p>and inequality of resources.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s evolutionarily recent.</p>
<p>What about, now this is the difference between</p>
<p>the Huberman, the excellent Huberman Lab podcast</p>
<p>that you did that people should listen to.</p>
<p>He is a brilliant scientist,</p>
<p>a sort of a rigorous analyst of what is true</p>
<p>in the scientific community,</p>
<p>also helps you with great advice on how to live.</p>
<p>Now, in contrast to that, I am a terrible,</p>
<p>almost idiotic level journalist.</p>
<p>So this is what you have to deal with.</p>
<p>Another thing that people talk about</p>
<p>that women care about is penis size.</p>
<p>Does penis size matter for women in sexual selection?</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s controversy about that.</p>
<p>In the evolutionary psychology community?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s not-</p>
<p>Is there papers on penis size?</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t say scientific papers,</p>
<p>so speculations about-</p>
<p>So not in nature or in science?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, no, nothing that I&rsquo;ve seen there.</p>
<p>I think that there&rsquo;s individual variability.</p>
<p>So this is something that comes up, again,</p>
<p>when I ask women in my classes, what do women want?</p>
<p>Some will say, a large penis.</p>
<p>But I think there&rsquo;s variability in that preference.</p>
<p>And it also might depend in part on the variability</p>
<p>in the woman&rsquo;s anatomy.</p>
<p>Do you think there&rsquo;s something fundamental</p>
<p>in terms of evolutionary psychology, in terms of evolution,</p>
<p>or is this a quirk of culture that&rsquo;s current,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s maybe somehow connected to pornography</p>
<p>or something like that?</p>
<p>Yeah, my guess is it&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s perhaps a quirk of culture</p>
<p>or something that is evolutionarily recent.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s a topic that hasn&rsquo;t been explored much.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never done work on it.</p>
<p>Well, somebody should do a PhD,</p>
<p>some archeologist should do a PhD</p>
<p>on the history of human civilization</p>
<p>and its valuation of penis size</p>
<p>and the correlation of penis size to the value of the male.</p>
<p>Okay, moving on.</p>
<p>Another absurd question in terms of what men want.</p>
<p>Again, definitely not a Huberman Lab podcast question.</p>
<p>Why do men?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say a large fraction of men love boobs.</p>
<p>Well, I think that-</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re one of the most cited evolutionary psychologists,</p>
<p>and this is what you signed up for,</p>
<p>these kinds of questions.</p>
<p>Questions like this, yeah.</p>
<p>Well, so again, this is something</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t studied directly, but scientifically.</p>
<p>Yes, yes.</p>
<p>But yeah, there&rsquo;s been some work on that, and it&rsquo;s-</p>
<p>Another cultural quirk, perhaps?</p>
<p>No, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a cultural quirk,</p>
<p>because I think it&rsquo;s the shape that matters a lot,</p>
<p>because shape is gonna be a cue to fertility.</p>
<p>So one of the things that humans are attracted to</p>
<p>in the opposite sex is sexually dimorphic features,</p>
<p>and breasts are a sexually dimorphic feature.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s dimorphic mean?</p>
<p>Difference in morphology between males and females.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>Diming to morphic morphology.</p>
<p>And women don&rsquo;t develop breasts until puberty,</p>
<p>or post-puberty, and so as a sexually dimorphic</p>
<p>characteristic, we tend to be attracted to that.</p>
<p>Same is true, by the way, with the waist-to-hip ratio</p>
<p>that we mentioned earlier.</p>
<p>Prior to puberty, males and females</p>
<p>have very similar waist-to-hip ratios,</p>
<p>but at puberty, there&rsquo;s a differential hip development</p>
<p>and fat deposition that creates a sexual dimorphism</p>
<p>with respect to waist-to-hip ratio.</p>
<p>And so again, men are attracted to this waist-to-hip ratio.</p>
<p>No man consciously says that.</p>
<p>They find this woman more attractive than that woman.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t think, ah, she has a waist-to-hip ratio of .70.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s exactly what I do, but anyway, most men, most men,</p>
<p>yes, so isn&rsquo;t that fascinating that we just build</p>
<p>these entire industries of fashion</p>
<p>and what we find beautiful around these kinds of ideas,</p>
<p>and we just, and then not just fashion,</p>
<p>and then we build, we have sociological tensions</p>
<p>about whether we should care about this kind of thing</p>
<p>or not, there&rsquo;s battles in that space.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, they seem so simple.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just the human body, and we wear clothes.</p>
<p>First of all, that&rsquo;s a funny thing.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the, why are we wearing clothes?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the shame aspect of covering up the body?</p>
<p>Is that another feature, or is that, what is that?</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s an interesting question, and I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like hiding ovulation.</p>
<p>Maybe that&rsquo;s another hiding, like maybe hiding</p>
<p>is a great game theoretic thing to play with,</p>
<p>is it can give you, it can give the powerless more power</p>
<p>by covering, maybe.</p>
<p>Well, I think there are a few things.</p>
<p>So one is the sort of arbitrary features of fashion,</p>
<p>and then the other is the aspects of fashion</p>
<p>that attempt to magnify what is inherent</p>
<p>in our evolved standards of beauty.</p>
<p>So for example, women tend to wear things</p>
<p>that accentuate their waist-tip ratio.</p>
<p>So, I mean, historically, those, in the old days,</p>
<p>corsets, for example, cinched the woman&rsquo;s waist.</p>
<p>And you wouldn&rsquo;t see fashion develop in a way</p>
<p>that made a woman seem old, unhealthy,</p>
<p>pockmarked, signs of open sores or lesions.</p>
<p>There are certain domains, design spaces that you wouldn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>that no culture would develop.</p>
<p>So, but there are arbitrary features,</p>
<p>but sometimes they&rsquo;re not entirely arbitrary,</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;re arbitrary at one level of description,</p>
<p>but not at another.</p>
<p>So for example, fashion tends to be linked with status,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s why it constantly changes.</p>
<p>The high-status people start wearing</p>
<p>a certain type of clothing,</p>
<p>and then when the lower-status people imitate them,</p>
<p>then they have to shift to signal their status.</p>
<p>And so I think the fashion and clothing</p>
<p>is in part linked to status.</p>
<p>So this is not you talking, this is me.</p>
<p>I just wanna make a statement, a profound statement,</p>
<p>that I think yoga pants, now this is broadly speaking,</p>
<p>but yoga pants is one of the greatest inventions</p>
<p>in human history.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s fire, and yoga, and I&rsquo;m just gonna leave it there.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a fan, and I have female friends</p>
<p>that talk about how comfortable yoga pants are,</p>
<p>which is what I&rsquo;m referring to when I say</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s one of the greatest inventions,</p>
<p>because comfort in fashion is really, really important to me.</p>
<p>Let me ask about sort of the sociological aspect of this.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve talked to Mark Zuckerberg,</p>
<p>who, the meta, who&rsquo;s the CEO, founder of Facebook,</p>
<p>and now meta, and owns Instagram.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;ve heard of him.</p>
<p>Yeah, he&rsquo;s a, yeah, he holds the American flag</p>
<p>and likes the water.</p>
<p>Anyway, so there&rsquo;s been criticisms</p>
<p>of social networks and so on,</p>
<p>and I just wanna ask you about the broader question here,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s objectification of the human body in the media,</p>
<p>and that creates standards for young women,</p>
<p>for young men, perhaps, but more young women.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You mentioned to the cruelty</p>
<p>that women can have towards each other in terms of,</p>
<p>well, let&rsquo;s, you know, cruelty is already a moral judgment.</p>
<p>Just, you&rsquo;ve made a statement about the fact</p>
<p>that women seem to point out imperfections in other women.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Do you think it&rsquo;s a problem in our modern society</p>
<p>that we objectify each other in this way?</p>
<p>Do you think this is a fundamental aspect of our biology</p>
<p>that we need to suppress versus celebrate,</p>
<p>just like we might suppress our natural desire for violence</p>
<p>if such exists in modern society?</p>
<p>Well, a couple of thoughts on that.</p>
<p>I think it is damaging,</p>
<p>the fact that so many images are displayed in social media,</p>
<p>and so what I would say is that there&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s called in the field, an evolutionary mismatch.</p>
<p>So we evolved in the context of small group living,</p>
<p>where there was made competition,</p>
<p>but your competitors were a small number</p>
<p>of other potential individuals,</p>
<p>and so people do comparisons.</p>
<p>Okay, but now what we have is this bombardment</p>
<p>of our visual system and our sexual psychology</p>
<p>and our mating psychology with thousands and thousands</p>
<p>of images that are not at all representative</p>
<p>of who our actual competition is in the mating domain.</p>
<p>And so I think that, and there&rsquo;s actually evidence on this</p>
<p>that Baz Luhrmann actually said something like this</p>
<p>in his sunscreen song.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you ever heard that,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s like a set of, it&rsquo;s a wonderful string of advice,</p>
<p>song about advice, but he says-</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, okay, sorry.</p>
<p>Yeah, he says, don&rsquo;t read beauty magazines</p>
<p>that will only make you feel ugly.</p>
<p>You know, and I think that there&rsquo;s truth to that,</p>
<p>that is, especially with women,</p>
<p>they look at all these images,</p>
<p>and, you know, of course, they&rsquo;re photographed,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re Photoshopped, they&rsquo;re highly selected</p>
<p>and not at all representative.</p>
<p>And so women compare themselves to that.</p>
<p>So I think this social comparison</p>
<p>is an evolved feature of humans.</p>
<p>I mean, males do it, females do it,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s exacerbated in the modern environment</p>
<p>in wildly evolutionarily mismatched ways.</p>
<p>And so I think that it is destructive, it&rsquo;s harmful.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s evidence that it hurts women&rsquo;s self-esteem.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s just another factoid or fact, if you will,</p>
<p>that at least in Western cultures,</p>
<p>males and females have roughly the same</p>
<p>overall average levels of self-esteem,</p>
<p>but once puberty hits, all of a sudden,</p>
<p>women&rsquo;s self-esteem starts to drop.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s because when they enter,</p>
<p>make competition, then they start</p>
<p>elevating the importance they attach to physical appearance.</p>
<p>And then as you point out, the tremendous objectification</p>
<p>that saturates social media and media in general</p>
<p>is damaging and harmful.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how to undo it, though.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how to design a society that undoes that.</p>
<p>Well, one of the ways we undo things,</p>
<p>just like you pointed out, is we use words.</p>
<p>We manipulate society, we manipulate social</p>
<p>and status hierarchies using our words for ill,</p>
<p>and we can do the same for good.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why there&rsquo;s a lot of clickbait articles</p>
<p>about Instagram leading to a lot of suffering</p>
<p>amongst teenage girls and all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m criticizing the clickbait nature</p>
<p>and not the contents of the articles.</p>
<p>But, you know, and those articles hopefully become viral</p>
<p>in a way that makes us rethink about how we</p>
<p>build social networks that kind of allow us</p>
<p>to too easily misrepresent how we look</p>
<p>when we are quote-unquote influencers</p>
<p>and what mental effect it has on young people</p>
<p>that look up to those influencers.</p>
<p>But I guess it&rsquo;s not the objectification fundamentally</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the problem, it&rsquo;s the inaccurate,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the fake news, it&rsquo;s the misrepresentation.</p>
<p>You still objectify the male body, the female body,</p>
<p>but you do so while misrepresenting the actual truth.</p>
<p>And so you&rsquo;re moving the average,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re moving the standard representation</p>
<p>of what a male should look like,</p>
<p>what a woman should look like.</p>
<p>And the dishonesty is the problem, not the objectification.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s just one other interesting empirical finding</p>
<p>on that, and it has to do with another dimension</p>
<p>that I think is harmful, and that&rsquo;s the thinness dimension.</p>
<p>And so if you, and these are studies originally done</p>
<p>by Paul Rosen, but they&rsquo;ve been replicated,</p>
<p>where if you ask men, okay, what is your ideal figure</p>
<p>in a woman, and so they have these, say, nine figures</p>
<p>that vary from very, very thin to average to plump.</p>
<p>Men give it the midpoint.</p>
<p>They say the midpoint is in relative thinness</p>
<p>or plumpness is what I value.</p>
<p>And you ask women, what is your ideal body type for you?</p>
<p>They give it, they say thinner, but then if you ask them,</p>
<p>what do you think male&rsquo;s ideal body type is?</p>
<p>They put it in exactly the same spot</p>
<p>that they put their own ideal, which is thin.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s actually an inaccurate perception</p>
<p>of how thin men desire women to be.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s partly exacerbated</p>
<p>by the fashion industry, where the models</p>
<p>are often real thin and, you know,</p>
<p>the lore is that clothes hang better on thin models</p>
<p>and then on TV, they say you gain 15 pounds</p>
<p>over what you really are or whatever.</p>
<p>For whatever reason, women misperceive</p>
<p>how thin men want them to be.</p>
<p>This is another huge sex difference, is eating disorders.</p>
<p>Anorexia, for example, bulimia, binging, purging,</p>
<p>where these eating disorders are nine to 10 times</p>
<p>more common in women than in men.</p>
<p>Can I just take a small tangent?</p>
<p>Because it was such a beautiful, the sunscreen song,</p>
<p>such a beautiful one, if I can read some of the words</p>
<p>from it, I really enjoy it.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s a great, it&rsquo;s a great song.</p>
<p>For people, you should check it out.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called Everybody&rsquo;s Free to Wear Sunscreen.</p>
<p>I guess it&rsquo;s actually a speech to a class.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s artificial or real,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a speech that gives advice.</p>
<p>And it goes, ladies and gentlemen of the class of 97.</p>
<p>I just remember it even now, those words.</p>
<p>Wear sunscreen.</p>
<p>If I could offer you only one tip for the future,</p>
<p>sunscreen would be it.</p>
<p>The long-term benefits of sunscreen</p>
<p>have been proven by scientists.</p>
<p>Whereas the rest of my advice has no basis more reliable</p>
<p>than my own meandering experience.</p>
<p>I will dispense this advice now.</p>
<p>Enjoy the power and beauty of your youth.</p>
<p>Oh, nevermind, you will not understand the power</p>
<p>and beauty of your youth until they&rsquo;re faded.</p>
<p>But trust me, in 20 years, you&rsquo;ll look back</p>
<p>at the photos of yourself and recall in a way</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t grasp now how much possibility</p>
<p>laid before you and how fabulous you really looked.</p>
<p>You are not as fat as you imagine.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t worry about the future or worry,</p>
<p>but know that worrying is as effective</p>
<p>as trying to solve an algebra equation</p>
<p>by chewing bubble gum.</p>
<p>The real troubles in your life are apt to be the things</p>
<p>that never cross your worried mind.</p>
<p>The kind that blindsides you at 4 p.m. on some idle Tuesday.</p>
<p>Do one thing every day that scares you.</p>
<p>Saying don&rsquo;t be reckless with other people&rsquo;s hearts.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t put up with the people who are reckless with yours.</p>
<p>Floss, don&rsquo;t waste your time on jealousy.</p>
<p>Sometimes you&rsquo;re ahead, sometimes you&rsquo;re behind.</p>
<p>The race is long and in the end, it&rsquo;s only with yourself.</p>
<p>Remember compliments you receive, forget the insults.</p>
<p>If you succeed in doing this, tell me how.</p>
<p>Keep your old love letters,</p>
<p>throw away your old bang statements.</p>
<p>Stretch, don&rsquo;t feel guilty if you don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>what you want to do with your life.</p>
<p>The most interesting people I know didn&rsquo;t know at 22</p>
<p>what they wanted to do with their lives.</p>
<p>Some of the most interesting 40-year-olds I know</p>
<p>still don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>For me, that&rsquo;s true for 50, 60, and 70-year-olds, honestly.</p>
<p>Get plenty of calcium, be kind to your niece.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll miss them when they&rsquo;re gone.</p>
<p>Maybe you&rsquo;ll marry, maybe you won&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Maybe you&rsquo;ll have children, maybe you won&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Maybe you&rsquo;ll divorce at 40.</p>
<p>Maybe you&rsquo;ll dance the funky chicken</p>
<p>on your 75th wedding anniversary.</p>
<p>Whatever you do, don&rsquo;t congratulate yourself too much</p>
<p>or berate yourself either.</p>
<p>Your choices are half chance, so are everybody else&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Enjoy your body, use it every way you can.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t be afraid of it or what other people think of it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the greatest instrument you&rsquo;ll ever own.</p>
<p>Dance, even if you have nowhere to do it</p>
<p>but in your own living room.</p>
<p>Read the directions, even if you don&rsquo;t follow them.</p>
<p>Do not read beauty magazines</p>
<p>that will only make you feel ugly.</p>
<p>Get to know your parents.</p>
<p>You never know when they&rsquo;ll be gone for good.</p>
<p>Be nice to your siblings.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re your best link to your past</p>
<p>and the people most likely to stick with you in the future.</p>
<p>Understand that friends come and go,</p>
<p>but a precious few who should hold on.</p>
<p>Work hard to bridge the gaps in geography and lifestyle.</p>
<p>For as older you get,</p>
<p>the more you need the people you knew when you were young.</p>
<p>Live in New York City once.</p>
<p>I actually took this advice.</p>
<p>This is fascinating advice.</p>
<p>I remember this advice well.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s broadly applied.</p>
<p>Live in New York City once, but leave before it makes you hard.</p>
<p>Live in Northern California once,</p>
<p>but leave before it makes you soft.</p>
<p>Travel.</p>
<p>Accept certain inalienable truths.</p>
<p>Prices will rise, politicians will philander,</p>
<p>you too will get old, and when you do,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll fantasize that when you were young,</p>
<p>prices were reasonable, politicians were noble,</p>
<p>and children respected their elders.</p>
<p>Respect your elders.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t expect anyone else to support you.</p>
<p>Maybe you have a trust fund,</p>
<p>maybe you&rsquo;ll have a wealthy spouse,</p>
<p>but you never know when either one might run out.</p>
<p>Never mess too much with your hair,</p>
<p>or by the time you&rsquo;re 40, it will look 85.</p>
<p>Be careful whose advice you buy,</p>
<p>but be patient with those who supply it.</p>
<p>Advice is a form of nostalgia.</p>
<p>Dispensing it is a way of fishing the past</p>
<p>from the disposal, wiping it off,</p>
<p>painting over the ugly parts,</p>
<p>and recycling it for more than it&rsquo;s worth.</p>
<p>But trust me on the sunscreen.</p>
<p>So this is, thank you for allowing me to read it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost sentimental for me.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know when I first heard it,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a few pieces of advice in that,</p>
<p>similar to the poem, If, by Rajat Kipling,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some deep truths when you step back</p>
<p>and look at it all, and also the places where you live.</p>
<p>Because I lived for a time in, I guess, Northern California,</p>
<p>with Google, and so on.</p>
<p>And one of the reasons I had to leave</p>
<p>is I felt I was becoming soft.</p>
<p>This is my own personal experience.</p>
<p>And the same is true for the cities of the East.</p>
<p>They can, if you&rsquo;re not careful, make you hard,</p>
<p>because everybody&rsquo;s super busy and rushing around,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s just a buzz to the city,</p>
<p>which is exciting, it&rsquo;s empowering,</p>
<p>but it can change you in ways.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s one of the reasons I&rsquo;m here in Austin,</p>
<p>that I fell in love with the city,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s such a nice balance of both.</p>
<p>And yeah, I&rsquo;ve lived on both coasts as well,</p>
<p>Boston area, and then Berkeley, California.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m familiar with both.</p>
<p>How&rsquo;d you end up in Austin, as a small side?</p>
<p>Well, I got my undergraduate degree here,</p>
<p>and then left for 20 years, and migrated around.</p>
<p>So went to UC Berkeley for my PhD,</p>
<p>Harvard for my first job, University of Michigan,</p>
<p>and then a job opened up at University of Texas</p>
<p>for an evolutionary psychologist.</p>
<p>And so they wanted me, fortunately,</p>
<p>so I was very happy to, so I&rsquo;ve always loved Austin.</p>
<p>Yeah, the love never died, it was there.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, it&rsquo;s a great town.</p>
<p>I was glad that I left, so, and experienced,</p>
<p>well, both coasts and also the Midwest,</p>
<p>but happy to be back in Austin.</p>
<p>Let me ask a difficult question.</p>
<p>Now, we did pretty good with some difficult questions</p>
<p>already, but there are people in this world today</p>
<p>who believe that gender is purely a social construct.</p>
<p>You, I think, are not one of those people.</p>
<p>To you, what are the difference between men and women?</p>
<p>How much of those differences are nature,</p>
<p>and how much is nurture?</p>
<p>I guess if you&rsquo;re asking the question</p>
<p>morphologically or psychologically,</p>
<p>I assume you&rsquo;re asking psychologically.</p>
<p>The question is what it is, and the answer,</p>
<p>sometimes the questions don&rsquo;t contain with them</p>
<p>the trajectory you take with the answer, right?</p>
<p>So I think I was asking both,</p>
<p>and the fact that both are a thing</p>
<p>is an interesting thing.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So you wrote a book, textbook, I should say,</p>
<p>Evolutionary Psychology, right?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Both of those words are in the book title,</p>
<p>psychology, that&rsquo;s the human mind.</p>
<p>Yes, yeah.</p>
<p>How much of gender, how much of sex is the human mind,</p>
<p>and how much of it is the biology?</p>
<p>The way that I phrase it, so I don&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>sort of dividing the world into two categories,</p>
<p>things that are biological</p>
<p>versus things that are not biological.</p>
<p>So biology is actually defined</p>
<p>as the study of life and life processes,</p>
<p>and so at that sort of abstract level,</p>
<p>everything we do is biological,</p>
<p>including culture and our capacity for culture,</p>
<p>which I think is an evolved capacity that humans have.</p>
<p>So when you get to the issue of sex and gender,</p>
<p>I mean, one cut at your question is,</p>
<p>are there universal psychological sex differences?</p>
<p>And the answer to that question is, yes, there are some.</p>
<p>So for example, well, and this is in one of your areas</p>
<p>of specialty, engineering,</p>
<p>one of the interesting things is that,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s called the people&rsquo;s thing dimension.</p>
<p>So do you want an occupation?</p>
<p>You want a job that involves people, social interaction,</p>
<p>or are you happy with a job that just involves things,</p>
<p>mechanical objects or computer code or whatever?</p>
<p>And this is one of the largest psychological</p>
<p>sex differences that exists, and it&rsquo;s true in every culture.</p>
<p>So in terms of, I don&rsquo;t know, magnitude of effects,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an effect size of more than a standard deviation,</p>
<p>difference between the means</p>
<p>on this psychological sex difference.</p>
<p>And so one of the interesting things is,</p>
<p>so if you go to places like,</p>
<p>go to the most gender egalitarian cultures in the world,</p>
<p>so places like Sweden or Norway,</p>
<p>which are explicitly gender egalitarian</p>
<p>and are truly in many, many ways,</p>
<p>but you allow people freedom of choice,</p>
<p>some of these sex differences actually get larger,</p>
<p>the psychological sex differences,</p>
<p>and also assortment into different occupational choices.</p>
<p>Now, but this is not something that I study,</p>
<p>I study mating and the sex differences,</p>
<p>if you ask in what domains</p>
<p>are the sex differences the largest,</p>
<p>it turns out they occur</p>
<p>within the domain of mating and sexuality.</p>
<p>So our evolved sexual psychology,</p>
<p>our evolved mating psychology</p>
<p>is to some degree sexually dimorphic.</p>
<p>Okay, with the very important asterisk</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re talking about overlapping distributions.</p>
<p>So there are some things that,</p>
<p>so if you look at human morphology,</p>
<p>we talked about breasts earlier,</p>
<p>women have evolved functional breasts</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s functional for lactation, men don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s no amount of culture or social coercion</p>
<p>can cause men to have lactating breasts.</p>
<p>Psychologically, we don&rsquo;t see dimorphism that extreme</p>
<p>where something is literally present in one sex</p>
<p>and totally absent in the other.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s overlap in the distributions.</p>
<p>So I mentioned earlier that in the mating domain,</p>
<p>men more than women on average</p>
<p>prioritize physical appearance,</p>
<p>physical attractiveness, relative youth.</p>
<p>Women on average prioritize resources,</p>
<p>resource acquisition,</p>
<p>qualities that lead to resource acquisition</p>
<p>like status, ambition, industriousness, and so forth.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s overlap in the distributions.</p>
<p>So some women place the total priority</p>
<p>on how physically attractive the guy is</p>
<p>and some men view that as irrelevant.</p>
<p>And so the point that I&rsquo;m making</p>
<p>is that there are psychological sex differences</p>
<p>that make some people uncomfortable.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s one of these things where I&rsquo;m a scientist,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a political advocate.</p>
<p>And so I adhere to the empirical data.</p>
<p>Empirical data are very strong in these domains.</p>
<p>So with respect to sex differences</p>
<p>in the mating domain and sexuality</p>
<p>and things we haven&rsquo;t even talked about</p>
<p>like desire for sexual variety</p>
<p>and sex differences in the whole desire</p>
<p>for short-term mating, huge sex differences there.</p>
<p>And these have been documented universally in all cultures.</p>
<p>So, okay, now, are there things that are culture-specific</p>
<p>or social-cultural overlays</p>
<p>onto these fundamental psychological sex differences?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s also an issue of levels of analysis,</p>
<p>levels of abstraction,</p>
<p>and how closely you look at the phenomenon.</p>
<p>So quick analogy, language.</p>
<p>So you say, well, in China, they speak Chinese.</p>
<p>In Korea, they speak Korean.</p>
<p>In Brazil, they speak Portuguese.</p>
<p>So look how culturally infinitely variable languages are,</p>
<p>which they are at that level.</p>
<p>But do humans have a universal human innate grammar?</p>
<p>And I think the evidence points to the answer yes to that.</p>
<p>At least that&rsquo;s what Steve Pink or Paul Bloom</p>
<p>and some others argue.</p>
<p>So at one level of abstraction,</p>
<p>things are infinitely culturally variable</p>
<p>or at least highly culturally variable.</p>
<p>At another level of abstraction, there&rsquo;s universality.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s one example in the mating domain of this.</p>
<p>So Margaret Mead, who is a famous anthropologist,</p>
<p>studied the Samoan Islanders,</p>
<p>and she tried to argue basically</p>
<p>for the infinite malleability of things like gender</p>
<p>and gender roles and so forth.</p>
<p>And she said, look at this culture.</p>
<p>In this culture, it&rsquo;s the men who paint their face,</p>
<p>whereas in Western cultures,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the women who wear makeup and so forth.</p>
<p>Well, it turns out if you look carefully</p>
<p>at the culture where men paint their face,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re painting war paint on their face.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not putting on makeup</p>
<p>to enhance their cues to youth and cues to health.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re putting on war paint</p>
<p>to make themselves more ferocious</p>
<p>or to demarcate what tribe they&rsquo;re in,</p>
<p>what coalition they&rsquo;re in.</p>
<p>And so at sort of one level of abstraction,</p>
<p>you could say, well, there&rsquo;s high cultural variability</p>
<p>in application of face paint,</p>
<p>but on another level,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s really a fundamental functional difference</p>
<p>in the purpose to which the paint is applied.</p>
<p>Yeah, and then you can abstract the paint away</p>
<p>in any fashion in general,</p>
<p>magnify the characteristics</p>
<p>that are appealing to the opposite sex,</p>
<p>because war paint is probably,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re magnifying the characteristics</p>
<p>that are appealing to the other sex.</p>
<p>So ability to gain resources, maintain resources,</p>
<p>status in the hierarchy, all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s part of it,</p>
<p>but I think another part has to do with,</p>
<p>in that case, male coalitions.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re in a intense,</p>
<p>this is another unique characteristic.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you got into this with Richard Wrangham.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t remember you talking about this,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s written a lot about male coalitionary psychology</p>
<p>and humans cooperate to an extraordinary degree</p>
<p>in forming coalitions for the purpose</p>
<p>of competing with rival coalitions.</p>
<p>And so you even see this with,</p>
<p>well, you see it in the sports arenas,</p>
<p>with team sports,</p>
<p>this team wears a different uniform than that team,</p>
<p>they have different mascot, et cetera.</p>
<p>And so part of that is male coalitionary psychology.</p>
<p>Well, so you write, again,</p>
<p>so returning to the textbook,</p>
<p>now, people should know you wrote a lot of incredible book</p>
<p>that is maybe more accessible</p>
<p>than the evolutionary psychology textbook, but.</p>
<p>The evolutionary psychology textbook is very accessible.</p>
<p>Yes, it is extremely accessible,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not your thing.</p>
<p>And on Amazon, you can&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s a pain, it&rsquo;s a textbook.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not, it&rsquo;s a little bit more of a pain to purchase,</p>
<p>which I did, I bought all your books.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re amazing.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll talk about a bunch of them.</p>
<p>But in terms of coalitions,</p>
<p>in chapter 12 of your evolutionary psychology textbook,</p>
<p>you write about status, prestige, and social dominance.</p>
<p>So how do hierarchies of status and social dominance</p>
<p>emerge in human society?</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s the value of status in sexual selection?</p>
<p>We talked about cues of individual health</p>
<p>and all that kind of stuff,</p>
<p>but what the heck&rsquo;s the purpose of status?</p>
<p>Why does it matter if I&rsquo;m the big boss?</p>
<p>Well, it matters because status</p>
<p>influences your access to resources</p>
<p>and your ability to influence other people</p>
<p>within your group.</p>
<p>And so this is part of the reason why women</p>
<p>prioritize a man&rsquo;s social status,</p>
<p>how he is viewed in the eyes of others,</p>
<p>because high-status men have access to more resources.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting that you ask about that</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ve just published,</p>
<p>this is with Patrick Durkee,</p>
<p>a former graduate student of mine,</p>
<p>we published a couple papers on precisely this issue</p>
<p>where we looked at what we call human status criteria.</p>
<p>That is, what are the things that lead to increases</p>
<p>or decreases in status?</p>
<p>And we did this in 14 different cultures.</p>
<p>And we found some things that are universal,</p>
<p>but also some things that are sex-differentiated.</p>
<p>And so universal things like people value trustworthiness,</p>
<p>they value intelligence, wisdom, knowledge.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s even if you go across cultures,</p>
<p>even to the small-scale cultures</p>
<p>that we alluded to earlier,</p>
<p>there are these wise people, wise men,</p>
<p>wise women in the culture</p>
<p>who have people go to for advice, for wisdom.</p>
<p>And so having a wide range of knowledge</p>
<p>is a universal status criterion.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s some things that are sex-differentiated</p>
<p>and they often fall into the mating domain as well.</p>
<p>This is where mating and status</p>
<p>are interestingly related to each other</p>
<p>in that successful mating increases your status,</p>
<p>but having high status also gives you access</p>
<p>to more desirable mates.</p>
<p>And so the game gets harder and harder always.</p>
<p>So wait, so are we talking about what are the characteristics,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the role of power and wealth, those kinds of things?</p>
<p>So you said wisdom is universal.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What about wealth and power?</p>
<p>Yeah, well, I guess it depends on what you mean by power.</p>
<p>So I think of power as the ability to influence-</p>
<p>A large number of people.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And this is one of the interesting things</p>
<p>about the fact that cash economies</p>
<p>are evolutionarily very recent</p>
<p>in that where people are like,</p>
<p>so I guess recently or it&rsquo;s about to happen</p>
<p>that Elon Musk is gonna buy Twitter.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s happened.</p>
<p>Has it happened already?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay, so they say like the wealthiest</p>
<p>or one of the wealthiest men on earth</p>
<p>has now purchased the most influential media platform</p>
<p>on earth.</p>
<p>So obviously you or I couldn&rsquo;t compete with Elon Musk</p>
<p>for the purchase of Twitter.</p>
<p>And so the fact that cash economies</p>
<p>allow the stockpiling of unprecedented amounts of wealth</p>
<p>produces these tremendous power differentials</p>
<p>that didn&rsquo;t exist in over most</p>
<p>of human evolutionary history.</p>
<p>So their wealth is power,</p>
<p>but you can also be,</p>
<p>power can be attained through other ways.</p>
<p>Yeah, but I would say that the interesting thing</p>
<p>about wealth is that it&rsquo;s an infinitely fungible resource.</p>
<p>So you can use it and translate it</p>
<p>into many, many other things like buying Twitter</p>
<p>or buying a big house or even getting mates</p>
<p>or an artificial in the,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you wanna get into that at all,</p>
<p>but they have these sex dolls</p>
<p>or virtual reality sex that some people are developing.</p>
<p>If you have enough resources,</p>
<p>you can purchase things like that.</p>
<p>So you can translate wealth</p>
<p>into a variety of other tangible things</p>
<p>in ways that you couldn&rsquo;t ancestrally.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one really powerful thing,</p>
<p>but there is still power that&rsquo;s correlated</p>
<p>but not intricately connected to wealth,</p>
<p>which is like being leaders of nations.</p>
<p>Like technically the president</p>
<p>of the United States salary is not very high.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Presidents and then you look,</p>
<p>you go outside of that and to the half of the world</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s living under authoritarian regimes,</p>
<p>you have dictators and those are very powerful,</p>
<p>usually men.</p>
<p>And presumably there&rsquo;s some value there</p>
<p>in the mating selection aspect.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not by chance that most of them are men.</p>
<p>And this is gonna sound strange</p>
<p>or, and hopefully not offensive to people,</p>
<p>but if you ask the question,</p>
<p>why is it the case that men are in positions of power</p>
<p>so much more so than women?</p>
<p>Well, in part, it can be traced to women&rsquo;s mate preferences.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s one of the sex differences</p>
<p>that women have over evolutionary time preferred men</p>
<p>who had power, status, resources, et cetera.</p>
<p>And what that has done</p>
<p>is it&rsquo;s created selection pressure on men</p>
<p>to attach a high motivational priority</p>
<p>to clawing their way up the status hierarchy.</p>
<p>And studies of time allocation distribution show this,</p>
<p>where men are, they&rsquo;re more willing to sacrifice</p>
<p>their friends, their grandmother, their kin or whatever</p>
<p>to claw their way up to the top of status hierarchies.</p>
<p>Women, much less so.</p>
<p>Women spend more effort maintaining relationships</p>
<p>with their kin, with their friends,</p>
<p>their friend networks and so forth.</p>
<p>And so in a way, you could say,</p>
<p>not only are men in positions of power more than women,</p>
<p>now you&rsquo;re blaming women for why they are.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not a matter of blame,</p>
<p>but I think that what I just outlined</p>
<p>is an essential part of the causal process,</p>
<p>the co-evolution of women&rsquo;s mate preferences</p>
<p>with men&rsquo;s motivational priorities.</p>
<p>How much do you think these mating strategies</p>
<p>underlie all of human civilization?</p>
<p>Like what motivates us?</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s Becker with the denial of death.</p>
<p>Why do we build castles and bridges and rockets</p>
<p>and the internet and all of this?</p>
<p>Is it some complex mush or is it underneath it all?</p>
<p>Are we all just trying to get laid?</p>
<p>Well, I wouldn&rsquo;t reduce it to something</p>
<p>quite as trying to get laid,</p>
<p>but I think mating is certainly part of it.</p>
<p>I wonder how big of a part,</p>
<p>because with Ernest Becker,</p>
<p>the idea is that we&rsquo;re all trying to achieve</p>
<p>an illusion of immortality.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re trying to create something that outlasts us</p>
<p>and therefore we create bigger and bigger things</p>
<p>in societies and bridges and architecture.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s missing from Becker&rsquo;s analysis is,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a fascinating book to read, Denial of Death,</p>
<p>but what&rsquo;s missing is that I think that the reason that,</p>
<p>and again, I think it&rsquo;s more men than women,</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a sex difference on this,</p>
<p>that men want to build a lasting legacy</p>
<p>because that will in turn affect their lineage.</p>
<p>And although I do, now Woody Allen is out of favor,</p>
<p>but I remember this quote from him, he said,</p>
<p>he didn&rsquo;t want to achieve immortality through his work,</p>
<p>he wanted to achieve immortality by not dying.</p>
<p>Oh boy, the funny ones are also deeply flawed often.</p>
<p>Staying on the topic of sex differences</p>
<p>in a very different way, perhaps.</p>
<p>So dominance and submissiveness,</p>
<p>something you&rsquo;ve also written about.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the role of that inside relationships</p>
<p>about this human dynamic of dominance and submissiveness?</p>
<p>Is that a feature or a bug?</p>
<p>So the stable state that these dynamical systems arrive at,</p>
<p>is it good to have an equality within a relationship</p>
<p>or is it good to have differences in a relationship?</p>
<p>Are you talking about romantic relationships</p>
<p>or just in human relationships?</p>
<p>Romantic, probably, because unless it could be generalized</p>
<p>to human relationships, perhaps it could be generalized</p>
<p>to human relationships.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t thinking that, but perhaps it could be,</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s start with romantic.</p>
<p>I guess one-on-one.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m personally in favor of equality on that dimension</p>
<p>within romantic relationships</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t talk about my personal life,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve been in relationships</p>
<p>and the best ones tend to be those where there&rsquo;s equality</p>
<p>and one person does not dominate the other.</p>
<p>But I guess the reason I ask you</p>
<p>is in what type of relationships,</p>
<p>because there are some things like coalitions</p>
<p>where hierarchy is very important</p>
<p>to the function of the coalition.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like if you&rsquo;re like a war coalition or something</p>
<p>in small group warfare, you can&rsquo;t just have equality.</p>
<p>You have to have leaders</p>
<p>that are determining the battle plan, so to speak.</p>
<p>And so if you&rsquo;re attacking a neighboring group or something</p>
<p>and everyone gets an equal say,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not gonna work that way.</p>
<p>And so we tend to appoint as leaders,</p>
<p>those who are, it doesn&rsquo;t always work out well,</p>
<p>but those who are presumably wise or good, effective leaders</p>
<p>and even talk about, and I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re familiar with this</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m not an expert on this,</p>
<p>but wartime leaders versus peacetime leaders.</p>
<p>And so, again, it depends on what the goal is</p>
<p>of the group that you are a part of.</p>
<p>And so I think there is functionality and utility</p>
<p>to a lot of our evolved psychology of status</p>
<p>and dominance and submissiveness.</p>
<p>So for example, and you have to look</p>
<p>at the individual psychology,</p>
<p>and this is actually something I&rsquo;m currently studying,</p>
<p>again, with Patrick Durkee,</p>
<p>where one advantage of the status hierarchies</p>
<p>is that you&rsquo;re not always battling.</p>
<p>So you determine, and that&rsquo;s why,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s another sexually dimorphic aspect of our psychology,</p>
<p>formidability assessment.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s evidence that males engage in this,</p>
<p>can I take this guy or can he take me?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like a-</p>
<p>The entirety of my life, yes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a spontaneous assessment of formidability.</p>
<p>And it also, that information is critical</p>
<p>because that means who you should not challenge</p>
<p>or who you can challenge with impunity.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s functionality to submitting as well,</p>
<p>because you defer to someone so that you don&rsquo;t get vanquished</p>
<p>and you live to see another day.</p>
<p>So I think we actually have a very rich psychology</p>
<p>of status hierarchies and dominance and submissiveness.</p>
<p>So especially sort of violent conflict, yes.</p>
<p>But back to relationships.</p>
<p>So maybe phrased another way,</p>
<p>what is masculinity, what is femininity?</p>
<p>Is there value inside a relationship for differences?</p>
<p>You talked about mating strategies with the dating stage</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re selecting the mate,</p>
<p>but also within mating broadly defined</p>
<p>as the entirety of the process.</p>
<p>Should those differences be magnified and celebrated</p>
<p>or sort of suppressed?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen enough different relationships work</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve seen enough relationships implode</p>
<p>to say there&rsquo;s not one size fits all on these things.</p>
<p>So even with respect to masculinity and femininity,</p>
<p>some reduce it psychologically to two other terms,</p>
<p>which are agency and communion.</p>
<p>So where agency is, are you instrumental, goal-oriented,</p>
<p>get tasks done, et cetera.</p>
<p>Communion is more the love and forming connections</p>
<p>with other people and so forth.</p>
<p>And I published a study a while back</p>
<p>on what&rsquo;s called unmitigated agency</p>
<p>and unmitigated communion.</p>
<p>So there are good and bad aspects of agency and communion.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s toxic, as they say, masculinity,</p>
<p>toxic femininity.</p>
<p>You can just rephrase that saying</p>
<p>there could be toxic agency and toxic communion.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>And so some elements of masculinity,</p>
<p>the unmitigated masculinity is, I think, terrible.</p>
<p>I was actually walking around downtown Austin earlier today.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just give you this example.</p>
<p>And this guy was, I guess, stuck</p>
<p>and wanted the car ahead of him to move.</p>
<p>And all of a sudden, he screamed out of his mouth,</p>
<p>move your fucking car!</p>
<p>And then jumped out of his car to approach the guy.</p>
<p>To me, that&rsquo;s toxic masculinity, if you will.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t need that, you know?</p>
<p>Yeah, so, and by the way,</p>
<p>as somebody who worked with cars quite a long time</p>
<p>in terms of human interaction</p>
<p>with semi-autonomous vehicles,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so fascinating how the car and traffic</p>
<p>brings out the worst in human nature.</p>
<p>In a sense, or maybe to rephrase that,</p>
<p>it maybe challenges you to explore something</p>
<p>that in terms of temper, in terms of anger,</p>
<p>in terms of anxiety that you have been bottling it up.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something where the car is like a vessel</p>
<p>for psychological experiment</p>
<p>of how much stress you can take.</p>
<p>And some people, that stress is like heating,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s making the water boil.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s fascinating to see what that results in.</p>
<p>I think if you are the kind of person</p>
<p>that explodes emotionally in traffic,</p>
<p>that means there&rsquo;s deeper issues to sort of confront.</p>
<p>And it seems like the traffic and the car</p>
<p>is a place where you get to confront the shadow.</p>
<p>Carl Jung&rsquo;s shadow.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something deep within that</p>
<p>that we don&rsquo;t often fish.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re alone with ourselves</p>
<p>and we get to see who we truly are.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, yeah, it can bring out road rage.</p>
<p>And also there&rsquo;s this, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re in the vehicle,</p>
<p>you have this shell around you.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s this feeling that you are protected from.</p>
<p>Yes, so you could be yourself,</p>
<p>you could be your true self in this moment.</p>
<p>And sometimes that true self in this moment</p>
<p>is an angry, screaming person,</p>
<p>which means you have to introspect that shadow,</p>
<p>shine a light.</p>
<p>Let me ask you about something that&rsquo;s ongoing currently.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d be fascinating to get your opinion on.</p>
<p>So something I&rsquo;ve been watching,</p>
<p>some of the world has been watching,</p>
<p>is the defamation trial</p>
<p>brought by Johnny Depp against Amber Heard.</p>
<p>Have you gotten a chance to watch any of it?</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t watched it, but I&rsquo;ve read some reports of it.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your analysis on this particular dynamic?</p>
<p>We talked about toxicity</p>
<p>in the space of agency and communion.</p>
<p>What do you make of this relationship</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s presented to the world in its raw form?</p>
<p>You know, I don&rsquo;t have strong opinions on it.</p>
<p>I think in this stage in the trial,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve heard from him primarily.</p>
<p>We have not, and we should say,</p>
<p>for people listening,</p>
<p>in case this is published a little bit later,</p>
<p>we have not heard from Amber Heard.</p>
<p>Right, not heard from Heard.</p>
<p>If we haven&rsquo;t heard from Heard,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re doing that, that&rsquo;s going to be happening this week.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I think that I&rsquo;ve seen,</p>
<p>and this is another topic that I have studied,</p>
<p>is intimate partner violence</p>
<p>and some of the nastier stuff</p>
<p>that goes on within relationships.</p>
<p>And I think that when this nasty stuff happens,</p>
<p>sometimes it&rsquo;s asymmetrical,</p>
<p>but sometimes it&rsquo;s symmetrical</p>
<p>in the sense that they get into these downward spirals</p>
<p>where one is insulting the other,</p>
<p>or even with physical violence,</p>
<p>one starts pushing the other,</p>
<p>shoving the other, hitting the other,</p>
<p>and then the other hits back.</p>
<p>And so you get into these cycles.</p>
<p>And so coming at one point in time,</p>
<p>in this case of Johnny Depp and Amber Heard,</p>
<p>years later and trying to disentangle</p>
<p>what actually went on in their relationship,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t feel qualified even to do that.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s fascinating to see.</p>
<p>So first, I mean, I have a lot of opinions,</p>
<p>particularly because I&rsquo;m just a,</p>
<p>a fan of Johnny Depp as a person,</p>
<p>and a fan of Johnny Depp, the actor,</p>
<p>and the kind of characters he created.</p>
<p>The person, because maybe this is fiction,</p>
<p>maybe this is reality,</p>
<p>but they tend to rhyme and mirror each other.</p>
<p>But his fascination with Hunter S. Thompson,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s some aspect of him</p>
<p>taking on the Hunter S. Thompson personality,</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s this layers upon layers of wit and humor,</p>
<p>and also anxiety and darkness</p>
<p>with the drug use and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s very human, very real person.</p>
<p>And so you get to,</p>
<p>one of the beautiful things about this trial</p>
<p>is you get to basically have a long-form podcast,</p>
<p>and you get to reveal the complexity of this human,</p>
<p>the humor under pressure, under stress,</p>
<p>but also just the rawness of love,</p>
<p>the things that love makes you do,</p>
<p>or whatever that is.</p>
<p>Whatever the things that keeps us in relationships</p>
<p>that are toxic, in that turmoil,</p>
<p>the hope, the self-delusion,</p>
<p>the push and pull of longing and fights,</p>
<p>the ups and downs, whatever the-</p>
<p>Yeah, the rollercoaster.</p>
<p>The rollercoaster of it.</p>
<p>The make-up sex.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>You know, yeah.</p>
<p>And the questions arise</p>
<p>whether that&rsquo;s a feature or a bug.</p>
<p>Like, why are we drawn to that?</p>
<p>You mentioned in mate selection,</p>
<p>for long-term mate selection,</p>
<p>I think you said women,</p>
<p>but I think maybe both don&rsquo;t want a kind of,</p>
<p>you had scientific and eloquent words to use,</p>
<p>but basically crazy people.</p>
<p>You want somebody who&rsquo;s stable.</p>
<p>Emotionally unstable, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, so.</p>
<p>But here it seems like maybe we&rsquo;re drawn to that still,</p>
<p>like flies to the light.</p>
<p>Right, well, it can be addictive,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not good for long-term relationships.</p>
<p>I mean, that characteristic,</p>
<p>and there is a stable personality characteristic.</p>
<p>It goes under different names,</p>
<p>anxiety, neuroticism, emotional ability, et cetera,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s the single personality characteristic</p>
<p>that is most predictive of breakups and divorces.</p>
<p>And in studies that I&rsquo;ve done,</p>
<p>predictive of conflict in couples,</p>
<p>people who are emotionally unstable,</p>
<p>they just get into a lot of conflict with their partner.</p>
<p>They create havoc.</p>
<p>So, that can be exciting,</p>
<p>but bad for long-term happiness.</p>
<p>They seek conflict in order to attain intimacy.</p>
<p>So conflict creates attention.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And if you take intimacy broadly, it&rsquo;s intimate.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re raw, fragile, you&rsquo;re right there.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, and there&rsquo;s one hypothesis</p>
<p>that was put forward by an Israeli biologist</p>
<p>named Amos Zahavi called the testing of a bond.</p>
<p>And so he asked the question,</p>
<p>why do people inflict costs on their partner?</p>
<p>Even like kissing, you&rsquo;re introducing,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a disease vector.</p>
<p>Why do people do these weird things,</p>
<p>inflicting costs, or emotional ability</p>
<p>is a way of inflicting costs.</p>
<p>And what he argues is it&rsquo;s the testing of a bond.</p>
<p>If the person&rsquo;s willing to tolerate this level of stress,</p>
<p>this level of cost imposition,</p>
<p>then that means they must be very committed to me.</p>
<p>And so, and I think that&rsquo;s something people do</p>
<p>in romantic relationships,</p>
<p>is they do test the strength of the bond.</p>
<p>They test the commitment of the person.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s a feature, not a bug,</p>
<p>in the sense that,</p>
<p>especially in the early stages of love, romantic love,</p>
<p>we tend to overly romanticize and idealize our partner.</p>
<p>So when there&rsquo;s an absence of evidence,</p>
<p>we impute positive values.</p>
<p>And what you, and this is one of my recommendations</p>
<p>to friends that I know is,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re really considering a good long-term commitment</p>
<p>to this person, go on vacation with them,</p>
<p>ideally to a foreign country</p>
<p>where both of you are unfamiliar.</p>
<p>Oh, I love it, road trip or something like that.</p>
<p>Yeah, so where you experience unexpected things,</p>
<p>stresses, you get a flat tire or whatever,</p>
<p>you encounter, and you see how the person deals with stress</p>
<p>and you see how you deal with each other under stress.</p>
<p>And I think that that&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>unless you have put stress tests on relationships,</p>
<p>you really don&rsquo;t know where things stand.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s a beautiful way to put it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a huge fan of that, like road trip.</p>
<p>And not just late in a relationship, like day one.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Road trip, not day one, day negative one,</p>
<p>before it even happens, just see, stress test.</p>
<p>Because it makes everybody better.</p>
<p>It creates intimacy or it creates,</p>
<p>it creates or it destroys.</p>
<p>But, you know, on the Johnny Depp,</p>
<p>so they also, they both suffered childhood abuse.</p>
<p>One of the things that I took away from the trial,</p>
<p>for me, it was just educational.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t get to see inside, as most of us,</p>
<p>maybe don&rsquo;t, like toxic relationships or fights and so on.</p>
<p>A lot of things that people maybe do inside of relationships</p>
<p>and we don&rsquo;t get to see it presented in such a raw way.</p>
<p>So, well, one of the things I learned is that,</p>
<p>you know, in terms of partner violence,</p>
<p>a woman too, can be violent.</p>
<p>Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>That to me, so emotionally and physically violent,</p>
<p>that, I almost don&rsquo;t want to,</p>
<p>you know, Amber Heard, I mean,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no limit to my dislike for that person,</p>
<p>in particular, because clearly, to me, at least,</p>
<p>I stand with Johnny Depp.</p>
<p>To me, that guy&rsquo;s full of love and,</p>
<p>but full of demons because he&rsquo;s drawn</p>
<p>to whatever the chaos that&rsquo;s created there.</p>
<p>But also, it&rsquo;s just an education for me</p>
<p>that I tend to associate sort of men with violence</p>
<p>and toxicity and destruction inside relationships,</p>
<p>but it was interesting to see that women too</p>
<p>can be like directly violent.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And men too, which was also surprising to me,</p>
<p>have the capacity to stay in such a relationship</p>
<p>and to not walk away, which is what I thought is my,</p>
<p>in terms of toxic, violent relationships,</p>
<p>I thought there&rsquo;s a male figure who will do emotional</p>
<p>and physical, mostly physical violence,</p>
<p>and then kind of manipulate the mind of the female</p>
<p>to stay in the relationship.</p>
<p>But that dynamic goes, can go both ways.</p>
<p>Yeah, it does go both ways.</p>
<p>And I think even the emotional abuse</p>
<p>is sometimes even worse than the physical abuse.</p>
<p>I mean, you see that in studies of,</p>
<p>even like childhood abuse,</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s the emotional abuse that is the most damaging.</p>
<p>What about the role of jealousy?</p>
<p>Something you also written about in a relationship.</p>
<p>Is that a feature or a bug?</p>
<p>You started to speak about it,</p>
<p>but is it good to be jealous of your partner</p>
<p>inside of a relationship?</p>
<p>How does it go wrong?</p>
<p>The pros and cons.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve written a whole book on this</p>
<p>called The Dangerous Passion,</p>
<p>Why Jealousy is as Necessary as Sex and Love.</p>
<p>And I think that one cut at your question</p>
<p>is that a moderate, so first of all,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a feature, not a bug in most cases.</p>
<p>So in the sense that you have to have an adaptation</p>
<p>that is sensitive to threats to a valued relationship.</p>
<p>And I think I alluded to this earlier</p>
<p>that just because you&rsquo;re in a relationship</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re in a relationship with a desirable partner,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t mean that you&rsquo;ve finished solving</p>
<p>the problems of mating that you need to solve,</p>
<p>because there are threats from the outside.</p>
<p>So mate poachers, people who try to lure your partner away</p>
<p>for either a sexual encounter</p>
<p>or a more committed romantic relationship.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s also dissatisfaction</p>
<p>within the relationship.</p>
<p>So your partner might become tempted</p>
<p>to be sexually unfaithful or romantically unfaithful</p>
<p>or emotionally unfaithful.</p>
<p>And so we need humans with the evolution</p>
<p>of long-term pair bonding,</p>
<p>we need adaptations to guard the relationship</p>
<p>and be sensitive to threats to the relationship.</p>
<p>And I think jealousy is one of those.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a key one.</p>
<p>And now that I think that there are a variety</p>
<p>of benefits to it, but also a variety of costs</p>
<p>or downsides to jealousy,</p>
<p>because we know that jealousy, male sexual jealousy</p>
<p>is the leading cause of spousal abuse</p>
<p>and spousal violence, physical violence,</p>
<p>probably emotional violence as well,</p>
<p>or psychological violence.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s why I call it the dangerous passion.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a necessary emotion, but it is also a dangerous emotion.</p>
<p>Leads to homicide, you know, leads to&hellip;</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve studied also homicidal ideation,</p>
<p>which intersects with this topic in that men,</p>
<p>sometimes women to a lesser degree,</p>
<p>develop homicidal ideation about people</p>
<p>who are trying to poach their mates</p>
<p>or who do poach their mates,</p>
<p>successfully poach their mates.</p>
<p>So what jealousy does is it alerts you</p>
<p>to a threat to the relationship,</p>
<p>and it motivates checking out the source of the threat.</p>
<p>How threatening is this?</p>
<p>So people tend to increase vigilance of their partner</p>
<p>in the modern world includes, you know,</p>
<p>hacking into their cell phone or computer,</p>
<p>monitoring them, sometimes stalking them,</p>
<p>but also can include positive things.</p>
<p>So it might be that&hellip;</p>
<p>So one trigger of jealousy</p>
<p>is a direct threat to the relationship,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s another more subtle trigger of jealousy,</p>
<p>which is a mate value discrepancy.</p>
<p>So usually when people mate,</p>
<p>they assort or pair up on overall mate value.</p>
<p>In the American 10-point scale,</p>
<p>the eights tend to pair up with the eights,</p>
<p>the sixes with the sixes,</p>
<p>the tens with the tens,</p>
<p>and the ones with the ones.</p>
<p>The American, is there other scales?</p>
<p>I wonder if the numerical systems,</p>
<p>well, there&rsquo;s a binary.</p>
<p>I just call it the binary, zero, one.</p>
<p>Sorry, go ahead.</p>
<p>The eights pairs with the eights, sevens.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, so in general,</p>
<p>but there are errors in mate selection.</p>
<p>You kind of alluded to that issue earlier</p>
<p>that sometimes people make errors,</p>
<p>in mate selection, which they do.</p>
<p>So sometimes you think this person</p>
<p>is well-matched on mate value, but they&rsquo;re not,</p>
<p>but then things change.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s say they&rsquo;re the same,</p>
<p>you have two sixes,</p>
<p>and then all of a sudden,</p>
<p>the woman&rsquo;s career takes off.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, she&rsquo;s getting promotion,</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s acquiring wealth,</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s attracting men who are of a different mate value</p>
<p>than she previously did.</p>
<p>Well, that triggers jealousy in the guy.</p>
<p>Even if she swears she&rsquo;s gonna be totally loyal</p>
<p>and she has no signs of leaving</p>
<p>or no signs of infidelity,</p>
<p>a mate value discrepancy is gonna trigger jealousy.</p>
<p>Now, what can it do?</p>
<p>Well, it can do, in the broadest sense,</p>
<p>people can do two classes of things.</p>
<p>They can do cost-inflicting things</p>
<p>or benefit-providing things.</p>
<p>So the man in that situation might say,</p>
<p>okay, I need to devote more attention to my partner.</p>
<p>I need to up my game when it comes to resource acquisition.</p>
<p>I need to lavish more attention and gifts on her.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s a whole suite of benefit-provisioning things</p>
<p>that can help to reduce that mate value discrepancy.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s also cost-inflicting things,</p>
<p>and humans, unfortunately, do both sets of things.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s also this, maybe that&rsquo;s love.</p>
<p>I notice the people I especially love</p>
<p>or have a connection to, romantically or otherwise,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a feeling like I don&rsquo;t deserve you.</p>
<p>So with friends, with so on.</p>
<p>Like, I mean, I tend to think that about almost everything,</p>
<p>which is why it&rsquo;s a strong signal</p>
<p>when I don&rsquo;t feel it that way,</p>
<p>which is like, I can&rsquo;t, how lucky am I to have this?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a weird illusion</p>
<p>of inflation of value or something.</p>
<p>Like, I think that the positive effect of that</p>
<p>is makes, motivates me to be better,</p>
<p>I guess on this one to 10 scale, to be higher.</p>
<p>And you sort of kind of have to like,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a nice feature that your mind sees others</p>
<p>that you have affection towards as higher value,</p>
<p>and it forces you to have that.</p>
<p>Like, I&rsquo;m a person that experiences jealousy,</p>
<p>and that forces me to be better.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I get my shit together.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, and I think that sometimes</p>
<p>the best relationships are when both people</p>
<p>feel lucky to be with the other person.</p>
<p>Yes, exactly, it&rsquo;s balanced that way.</p>
<p>And then that&rsquo;s when you, in terms of jobs,</p>
<p>in terms of going to the gym, all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>And yeah, so a little bit of jealousy.</p>
<p>I have discussion with those people.</p>
<p>I always wonder, there&rsquo;s people in relationships</p>
<p>where like, no, no, there&rsquo;s no,</p>
<p>they never experienced jealousy.</p>
<p>I wonder what that&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re very successful relationships,</p>
<p>but, and I always wonder, you know, I&rsquo;m currently single,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m always doubt that I know</p>
<p>what the hell I&rsquo;m doing at all.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m definitely somebody that experiences jealousy</p>
<p>and kind of enjoys jealousy, like a little bit,</p>
<p>of like missing, to me, that&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re missing the other person.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Or longing for the other person.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s another interesting wrinkle</p>
<p>that I also talk about in the book,</p>
<p>is sometimes people intentionally evoke jealousy</p>
<p>in their partner.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s also a kind of testing</p>
<p>of a bond kind of issue.</p>
<p>So, and especially women, but I think both sexes</p>
<p>interpret a total absence of jealousy</p>
<p>as a sign that their partner&rsquo;s not sufficiently committed</p>
<p>to them or sufficiently in love with them.</p>
<p>So if you like to say, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>if you go to a party with your partner</p>
<p>and then you leave the room for some reason,</p>
<p>you come back and your partner is passionately kissing</p>
<p>someone else and doesn&rsquo;t bother you at all,</p>
<p>that might be a cue to the partner</p>
<p>that, well, maybe you&rsquo;re not very in love with that person</p>
<p>or not very committed to them.</p>
<p>And so-</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a good way to test.</p>
<p>That said, I mean, I love the term meat poaching,</p>
<p>by the way.</p>
<p>I believe here in Texas, meat poaching is officially legal.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m allowed to,</p>
<p>one of my favorite songs by Hendrix is, Hey Joe.</p>
<p>Hey Joe, where you going with that gun in your hand?</p>
<p>And yeah, I actually always wanted to play that song,</p>
<p>but I get, I start to think about guns and so on.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s supposed to capture a feeling.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not actual violence.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s saying, I&rsquo;m going to shoot my old lady.</p>
<p>I caught her messing around with another man.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a blues type of feeling,</p>
<p>like of anger of, I guess, for meat poaching,</p>
<p>for meat switching performed by the partner</p>
<p>and then the frustration and the anger that&rsquo;s resulting.</p>
<p>I always wondered why the violence</p>
<p>is directed towards the partner</p>
<p>versus the person who did the other male.</p>
<p>It tends to be evenly split.</p>
<p>So sometimes, and that&rsquo;s, I mean,</p>
<p>men especially, when someone poaches on their mate,</p>
<p>they have homicidal fantasies.</p>
<p>Or which equally split.</p>
<p>Toward the mate poacher.</p>
<p>Yeah, but equally split.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s, I think the non-lethal violence</p>
<p>tends to be more directed toward the mate</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s, and this is a horrible thing</p>
<p>of male sexual psychology,</p>
<p>but I think part of the violence is functional</p>
<p>in the sense that it&rsquo;s designed to keep a mate</p>
<p>and prevent her from engaging in anything</p>
<p>with other potential mate poachers.</p>
<p>But people do.</p>
<p>So even, it goes back to the French law</p>
<p>where they had the so-called crime of passion.</p>
<p>So if a husband walked in and found his wife</p>
<p>having sex with some other guy in bed and shot him,</p>
<p>that was viewed as a crime of passion.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s still not legal, but you kinda get a discount for it.</p>
<p>Whereas if he goes home, thinks about it for a while,</p>
<p>then gets a gun and comes back,</p>
<p>then that&rsquo;s premeditated murder.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>See, to me, I guess everybody&rsquo;s different.</p>
<p>To me, I have zero anger towards the partner</p>
<p>in that situation.</p>
<p>To me, because that&rsquo;s definitive proof of disloyalty.</p>
<p>So like, why, what&rsquo;s the function of the anger there?</p>
<p>To me, all of my anger is towards the guy, the poacher.</p>
<p>Right, right.</p>
<p>Because some of it has to do probably</p>
<p>with the status establishing.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s, what was the term you used?</p>
<p>The formidability?</p>
<p>Yeah, formidability assessment.</p>
<p>Assessment.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, wait, wait, wait.</p>
<p>Did you just say you&rsquo;re more formidable than me</p>
<p>in this situation?</p>
<p>I wanna reestablish, at least in my own mind,</p>
<p>the formidability.</p>
<p>And that seems to be, I guess we&rsquo;re all different,</p>
<p>but maybe because I roll around with guys a lot,</p>
<p>like grapple and wrestling, all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>To me, to establish status,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s competing with other males, not with the female.</p>
<p>Because that&rsquo;s a break of loyalty.</p>
<p>Like why, what&rsquo;s the point of anger at this point?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just betrayal.</p>
<p>Well, except that a lot of it,</p>
<p>a lot of the mate poaching is discovered,</p>
<p>or cues to mate poaching are discovered</p>
<p>before the consummation of the act.</p>
<p>So it might be just-</p>
<p>Oh, like the emotional cheating leading up to it.</p>
<p>Or mild flirtation, you know, things like that.</p>
<p>And so the violence is designed to head off</p>
<p>the threat before it becomes real.</p>
<p>Boy, aren&rsquo;t human relations,</p>
<p>especially romantic ones, complicated?</p>
<p>So-</p>
<p>Very.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s what makes them so fascinating to study.</p>
<p>And so fun, yes, exactly.</p>
<p>From a science perspective,</p>
<p>and to study from within, sort of,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s like Richard Ranham with the chimps,</p>
<p>like, you know, be in it.</p>
<p>Study from the end of one perspective.</p>
<p>What do you make of polyamory?</p>
<p>So what the heck is, what do you make of marriage?</p>
<p>What are your thoughts about marriage?</p>
<p>What are your thoughts about lifelong monogamy?</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s your thoughts about polyamory,</p>
<p>given that we&rsquo;ve been talking about ideas</p>
<p>of mate switching and poaching,</p>
<p>and all that kind of stuff?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think that we evolved to be,</p>
<p>I prefer the term pair-bonded species.</p>
<p>So pair-bonding is one of the strategies.</p>
<p>Pair-bonded long-term mating is one of the strategies.</p>
<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean</p>
<p>for decades and decades, or lifelong,</p>
<p>because we often pair-bond serially.</p>
<p>So get into a relationship that might last a year,</p>
<p>or five years, and then break up,</p>
<p>and then form another relationship.</p>
<p>So we engage in serial mating.</p>
<p>We engage in infidelity.</p>
<p>We engage in some short-term mating.</p>
<p>And so we have what I describe</p>
<p>as a menu of mating strategies.</p>
<p>And which particular mating strategy</p>
<p>an individual adopts depends on a wide variety of factors.</p>
<p>I think some are just kind of personal proclivities.</p>
<p>Some depend on your mate value.</p>
<p>So if you are an eight, a nine, or a 10,</p>
<p>you have more options for what mating strategy</p>
<p>you wanna pursue.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a one or a two,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not gonna be able to be polyamorous</p>
<p>in all likelihood.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of attention to polyamory now.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s unclear whether there&rsquo;s an increase in it,</p>
<p>or whether people are just talking about it more.</p>
<p>It is the case, and I know several people</p>
<p>who are in polyamorous relationships,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve talked with them in detail about them.</p>
<p>And jealousy is often a factor in that.</p>
<p>And they describe it as kind of like an emotion</p>
<p>that has to be somehow tamed or dealt with in some way.</p>
<p>And so in polyamory,</p>
<p>there are many different types of polyamory.</p>
<p>So one type, for example,</p>
<p>is you have a primary love partner,</p>
<p>and then some others on the side that are permitted,</p>
<p>usually within, in consensual terms,</p>
<p>within an explicit contract</p>
<p>that the primary partners work out.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s okay if you, I know as one couple,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s okay if you do it outside the city limits</p>
<p>of Los Angeles, but not within.</p>
<p>Some say it&rsquo;s okay for Thursday,</p>
<p>but I want the weekend, the Friday and Saturday nights to me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s okay if there&rsquo;s sexual involvement,</p>
<p>but no emotional involvement.</p>
<p>So there are different strategies that people work out,</p>
<p>and some of them are designed</p>
<p>to try to keep jealousy at bay.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s an evolved emotion</p>
<p>that is a natural emotion that people experience.</p>
<p>Now, interestingly, while we&rsquo;re on this topic,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a sex difference therein.</p>
<p>Namely, if you contrast sexual jealousy</p>
<p>with emotional jealousy,</p>
<p>or sexual infidelity with emotional infidelity.</p>
<p>And so in one set of studies,</p>
<p>I put my participants, or we used to call them subjects,</p>
<p>into this, what I call the Sophie&rsquo;s Choice</p>
<p>of the Jealousy Dilemmas, where I said,</p>
<p>imagine your partner became interested in someone else,</p>
<p>and you discover that they have had</p>
<p>passionate sexual intercourse with this person,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ve gotten emotionally involved with them,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve fallen in love with them.</p>
<p>Which aspect of the infidelity upsets you more?</p>
<p>And when you, and that&rsquo;s why I call it the Sophie&rsquo;s Choice,</p>
<p>both terrible choices, right?</p>
<p>But men, much more likely to say the sexual infidelity</p>
<p>is what upsets me.</p>
<p>More women, it&rsquo;s like, why are you even asking me?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a no-brainer.</p>
<p>85% of the women say the emotional infidelity</p>
<p>is what bothers them more.</p>
<p>Former student of mine, Barry Cooley,</p>
<p>did a really interesting study of analysis</p>
<p>of this reality show called Cheaters.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve actually never seen it,</p>
<p>but where if you suspect your partner of cheating,</p>
<p>then a detective from the TV team will follow the person,</p>
<p>and then they&rsquo;ll call up and say,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve just found your husband here in the No-Tell Motel,</p>
<p>do you wanna come down and talk to him?</p>
<p>And so what he analyzed, though,</p>
<p>was the verbal interrogations that people had</p>
<p>when they confronted their partner,</p>
<p>and women wanted to know, are you in love with her?</p>
<p>Men wanted to know, did you fuck him?</p>
<p>Or did you have sex with him?</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s this sex difference in sensitivity</p>
<p>to these different cues of infidelity.</p>
<p>And of course, there&rsquo;s an evolutionary logic</p>
<p>to this sex difference, and it&rsquo;s been replicated,</p>
<p>not the Cheaters study,</p>
<p>but the hypothetical Sophie&rsquo;s Choice study</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s been replicated now in Sweden and China,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a universal sex difference.</p>
<p>So given that sex difference,</p>
<p>and you mentioned another one that just returned to,</p>
<p>which is in the engineering disciplines.</p>
<p>Yeah, person, thing, orientation.</p>
<p>So until I started to see,</p>
<p>writing about it in the psychology literature,</p>
<p>I observed this anecdotally a lot.</p>
<p>And the reason I observed it is I was confused,</p>
<p>so I care a lot about robots, I&rsquo;m a robotics person.</p>
<p>And so a lot of males in the robotics community</p>
<p>really didn&rsquo;t care about what&rsquo;s called</p>
<p>the human-robot interaction problem,</p>
<p>which is like robots when they interact with humans.</p>
<p>And then a lot of females, all brilliant,</p>
<p>in the robotics community,</p>
<p>cared about the human-robot interaction.</p>
<p>They cared about the human,</p>
<p>what the robot communicates with the human,</p>
<p>human in the picture, human in the loop.</p>
<p>And I was really confused,</p>
<p>because the difference to me in my anecdotal interactions,</p>
<p>but the end is quite large there.</p>
<p>Like I, you know, I&rsquo;m in the robotics community,</p>
<p>I know a lot of people.</p>
<p>And I was confused because for me,</p>
<p>I really care about human-robot interaction.</p>
<p>I see, I care about both a lot.</p>
<p>And in the same thing here,</p>
<p>in terms of emotional cheating versus physical cheating,</p>
<p>I care a lot about both,</p>
<p>and I have like this oscillating brain.</p>
<p>So I wonder what that says about my brain.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll often wonder this,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s specific sex differences</p>
<p>that are represented in the data and the literature,</p>
<p>and I seem to oscillate depending on mood.</p>
<p>And I wonder what that says about me.</p>
<p>Why do I care so much about that robot on the floor?</p>
<p>I care not, half I care about how it works,</p>
<p>and the other half, how it makes other people feel.</p>
<p>What is that?</p>
<p>Yeah, so I guess what I would say,</p>
<p>this gets back to our earlier discussion</p>
<p>of agency and communion,</p>
<p>where I actually think that it&rsquo;s a sign</p>
<p>of being well-balanced,</p>
<p>to have both capacities within you.</p>
<p>And so you get people who are unimodal,</p>
<p>or they just have one mode of operating.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say it&rsquo;s the thing mode,</p>
<p>which engineers tend to be good at.</p>
<p>You have to be good at it to be a good engineer,</p>
<p>because things have to actually work.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not in some dream or hypothetical state,</p>
<p>things have to actually work.</p>
<p>But with the agency and communion,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s good to have a balance.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why I think some of the best</p>
<p>romantic relationships are those where people are,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re high on what they used to call androgyny,</p>
<p>where they have both the positive features</p>
<p>of agency and communion,</p>
<p>the positive features of masculinity and femininity</p>
<p>within the same mix,</p>
<p>but also with the footnote of not the unmitigated agency</p>
<p>or unmitigated communion,</p>
<p>both of which can be negative.</p>
<p>And so I view these as capacities,</p>
<p>and some people are out of balance,</p>
<p>some people have a good balance between the two.</p>
<p>It sounds like you have a good balance between the two.</p>
<p>Well, but also the allocation.</p>
<p>I feel like it&rsquo;s a very dynamic thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, I&rsquo;m at least aware, for me personally,</p>
<p>of the beauty between humans,</p>
<p>of the dance, of the push and pull,</p>
<p>of the different moods.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a dynamical system.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not two static entities fully represented</p>
<p>and consistent through every interaction.</p>
<p>Sometimes, you know, people might confuse the fact</p>
<p>that I often talk about love,</p>
<p>and I love humans, that I don&rsquo;t have a temper,</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t have, like, I lose my shit all the time,</p>
<p>especially on things I really am passionate about,</p>
<p>like people I work with and so on.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m all over the place.</p>
<p>But underneath it, there&rsquo;s a deep love</p>
<p>and respect for humans,</p>
<p>but I lose my shit all the time.</p>
<p>And that chaos, that rollercoaster,</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s what makes human relations awesome.</p>
<p>I mean, the push and pull of it.</p>
<p>Of course, it can oscillate too far,</p>
<p>which is when it becomes Amber Heard type of situation,</p>
<p>when it turns to emotional or physical violence,</p>
<p>when it turns to jealousy,</p>
<p>crosses a line where it&rsquo;s hurtful.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s like, it crosses that vast gray landscape</p>
<p>of what is abuse versus what is just</p>
<p>beautiful turmoil of human nature, right?</p>
<p>Yes, yeah.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s complicated, it&rsquo;s, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s complicated and it&rsquo;s dynamic.</p>
<p>And I would just add to that,</p>
<p>I thought you phrased that brilliantly,</p>
<p>but I would just add to that,</p>
<p>it also depends on sort of what you&rsquo;re trying to do.</p>
<p>And so I think some of the oscillation can be what task,</p>
<p>what problem you&rsquo;re trying to solve.</p>
<p>And so if you&rsquo;re, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>trying to build a bridge or something,</p>
<p>you need to be very thing-oriented</p>
<p>and make sure the damn thing actually works</p>
<p>and doesn&rsquo;t collapse when a car goes over it.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re trying to form a relationship</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re entirely thing-oriented,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not gonna work.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s one of the people,</p>
<p>one of the things with,</p>
<p>and males tend to be more on the so-called spectrum</p>
<p>side of things where one of the hallmarks</p>
<p>is a deficit in social mind reading.</p>
<p>It was just to add to your point about,</p>
<p>I guess I&rsquo;ve already made it,</p>
<p>that of the dynamic properties of the rollercoaster</p>
<p>is depending on what problem you&rsquo;re trying to solve,</p>
<p>you might wanna toggle back and forth</p>
<p>to one pole or the other.</p>
<p>You wrote a book called Why Women Have Sex,</p>
<p>Understanding Sexual Motivations</p>
<p>From Adventure to Revenge, that sounds fun,</p>
<p>and Everything in Between.</p>
<p>So, why do women have sex?</p>
<p>Well, I co-wrote it with a female,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s Cindy Meston, a wonderful friend and colleague</p>
<p>and co-author and co-collaborator.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t be presumptuous enough to write a book</p>
<p>called Why Women Have Sex by myself as a male.</p>
<p>Did you contribute anything to this book?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just kidding.</p>
<p>I did, but I have to tell you a story</p>
<p>about the origins of this idea,</p>
<p>which I give credit to Cindy Meston for.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s a colleague in the psychology department with me,</p>
<p>and we would go out to dinner once a week or so,</p>
<p>and we were just talking about this.</p>
<p>She raised this issue, and so we started to brainstorm.</p>
<p>Originally, it was why humans have sex,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s the scientific article we published</p>
<p>was why humans,</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re interested in males and females.</p>
<p>I said, I would come up,</p>
<p>well, they have sex because of X,</p>
<p>and then Cindy Meston would come up,</p>
<p>she&rsquo;d say, oh, here are seven other reasons,</p>
<p>and then I&rsquo;d come up with one more,</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;d come up with another seven,</p>
<p>and so it was like,</p>
<p>so she&rsquo;s, in some sense, importantly,</p>
<p>the originator or fountain of this idea, but-</p>
<p>Oh, so she&rsquo;s able,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something about the way she thinks about sexuality</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s able to deeply introspect about reasons for sex.</p>
<p>Yeah, and probably especially about female sexuality,</p>
<p>and this is one of the interesting things</p>
<p>and why it&rsquo;s so fun for me to collaborate with,</p>
<p>in this case, a female,</p>
<p>because they do have a different sexual psychology</p>
<p>than males, and I&rsquo;ve noticed this.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why in my graduate,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;ve had 30 or so PhD students,</p>
<p>about half have been male, half have been female,</p>
<p>and the women come up with different questions,</p>
<p>different scientific questions</p>
<p>that I wouldn&rsquo;t have thought of, necessarily,</p>
<p>and so, anyway, so it turned out to be a good collaboration.</p>
<p>I will say that we co-wrote it</p>
<p>and that I did contribute to it,</p>
<p>and especially the evolutionary insights.</p>
<p>So is there a good few words you can say</p>
<p>to why women have sex?</p>
<p>What are some primary motivations?</p>
<p>Well, we originally came up with a list of 237 reasons</p>
<p>for why humans have sex,</p>
<p>and they range from some of the obvious ones,</p>
<p>because it feels good,</p>
<p>because I want it to relieve stress,</p>
<p>to relieve menstrual cramps, to get rid of a headache,</p>
<p>to get my boyfriend off my back</p>
<p>so I could get some work done,</p>
<p>so things like that, to others.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s another one,</p>
<p>so that he&rsquo;d take out the damn garbage, was one,</p>
<p>but another one, it was kind of interesting</p>
<p>that one nomination was to get closer to God,</p>
<p>so there were some that were kind of spiritual motivations</p>
<p>for having sex,</p>
<p>and then some of the nastier ones,</p>
<p>like to get revenge on my partner</p>
<p>or to get revenge on a rival,</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s like sleeping with my rival&rsquo;s boyfriend,</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s some nasty stuff and some good stuff in there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so fascinating because, yeah,</p>
<p>sex has such a powerful role in our psychology</p>
<p>but also in our culture,</p>
<p>so you can make significant statements</p>
<p>in the status hierarchy</p>
<p>about the selection of your sexual partner.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting, so it&rsquo;s not just because you&rsquo;re horny,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all those other kinds of things.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, horniness is one,</p>
<p>but there are other reasons.</p>
<p>What about different kinds of sex?</p>
<p>Again, this is not the Human Room and Lab podcast.</p>
<p>Rough sex versus, quote, making love,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the explanation between all of that,</p>
<p>all the various kinks?</p>
<p>No, that&rsquo;s just a basic sort of split,</p>
<p>but all the different kinks that humans establish,</p>
<p>all the different fantasies and all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, that&rsquo;s a complicated question</p>
<p>for which I don&rsquo;t think we have sufficient time</p>
<p>to get into that in detail,</p>
<p>and it is complicated</p>
<p>because there are some sexual fantasies that,</p>
<p>sexual fantasies, by the way,</p>
<p>I think are a really fascinating window</p>
<p>into our sexual psychology</p>
<p>because, in a way, they&rsquo;re unconstrained</p>
<p>by things like rules and norms in society</p>
<p>and cultural presses that you&rsquo;re kind of free</p>
<p>to fantasize about whatever you want to fantasize about.</p>
<p>So I think it provides an interesting window</p>
<p>into human sexuality,</p>
<p>and there are some predictable ones,</p>
<p>and then there are some also individual</p>
<p>or idiosyncratic ones,</p>
<p>and, again, there&rsquo;s a fundamental sex difference in this</p>
<p>in that when you talk about fetishes</p>
<p>or shoe fetishes, leather fetishes,</p>
<p>different types of things,</p>
<p>males are much more prone to those than females.</p>
<p>Shoe fetish, you said?</p>
<p>Shoe fetish, almost all fetishes.</p>
<p>Males are overrepresented,</p>
<p>and I think it&rsquo;s partly because</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some evidence that they&rsquo;re classically conditioned,</p>
<p>so I think that first or early sexual experiences</p>
<p>that people have kind of condition them</p>
<p>to the cues that are present during those early ones,</p>
<p>and so if your first sexual experience happened to be,</p>
<p>involve visual images of shoes</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re having to be looking at shoes</p>
<p>when you first had sex,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just an example,</p>
<p>or leather or zippers or whatever the case is,</p>
<p>that people develop these very individualistic</p>
<p>sexual turn-ons based on these early sexual experiences.</p>
<p>So it could also be, you said have sex,</p>
<p>but it could also be sexual feelings,</p>
<p>early sexual feelings.</p>
<p>So I wonder what that is about men,</p>
<p>that they have a more,</p>
<p>when they first start experiencing sexual feelings,</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re more sensitive to the cues,</p>
<p>and those cues somehow have a deep psychological effect</p>
<p>on their development of their sexuality.</p>
<p>So if they have kinks,</p>
<p>that means they&rsquo;re somehow more cue-sensitive,</p>
<p>and maybe, does the matter of society</p>
<p>slap someone on the wrist for it?</p>
<p>Does that help solidify the kinks?</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t know about the society slapping on the wrist,</p>
<p>but I think what it is is this,</p>
<p>I think this is the evolutionary hypothesis, anyway,</p>
<p>about why there&rsquo;s this sex difference,</p>
<p>and that is that men are conditioned to anything</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s gonna lead to sex,</p>
<p>whereas women don&rsquo;t have to be.</p>
<p>From a male perspective,</p>
<p>because of women&rsquo;s greater investment,</p>
<p>because the nine-month pregnancy, et cetera,</p>
<p>in order to reproduce,</p>
<p>women have to invest this tremendous amount.</p>
<p>Men don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>One act of sex can produce an offspring,</p>
<p>and so, for men, but not for women,</p>
<p>and so this huge asymmetry in investment</p>
<p>means that the payoff matrix</p>
<p>of different sexual strategies differs for the sexes.</p>
<p>In that context, women become the valuable</p>
<p>and scarce resource over which men compete,</p>
<p>so anything that leads to successful sex</p>
<p>is gonna be selected for it,</p>
<p>and so men are very sensitive to being sexually conditioned,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s called sexual conditioning,</p>
<p>to whatever cues are associated with sex happening.</p>
<p>From a woman&rsquo;s perspective, sex is not a scarce resource,</p>
<p>so a woman could go out here in Austin any night,</p>
<p>or probably any day on 6th Street,</p>
<p>and have no problem having sex with a guy within 10 minutes.</p>
<p>Guy would have more difficulty.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not gonna go out,</p>
<p>unless he&rsquo;s Johnny Depp or really, really charming.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, that&rsquo;s a fascinating dimorphism</p>
<p>or asymmetry in our mate selection.</p>
<p>What do you think is the effect on this young male brain,</p>
<p>but female too, of pornography?</p>
<p>So, one of the fascinating things</p>
<p>that the digital world brought us,</p>
<p>now, I grew up at a time when a magazine,</p>
<p>like a Victoria&rsquo;s Secret magazine</p>
<p>was my source of sexual inspiration,</p>
<p>but that was before the internet,</p>
<p>and now the internet with pornography</p>
<p>makes it extremely accessible.</p>
<p>All kinds of kinks, all kinds of wild variety.</p>
<p>I mean, variety in quantity is immense.</p>
<p>So, what do you think that has,</p>
<p>how that affects mate selection, mating,</p>
<p>and just the human psychology of the two sexes</p>
<p>of the species?</p>
<p>Yeah, great question, a big question.</p>
<p>So, I mean, we could have a whole podcast</p>
<p>just on that, or at least talk for a while about it.</p>
<p>So, I&rsquo;ll just say a couple of things about that.</p>
<p>One is, again, there&rsquo;s a sex difference,</p>
<p>and I feel like I&rsquo;m a broken record here</p>
<p>hammering on this, but it is-</p>
<p>So, a lot of, just to actually echo the thing,</p>
<p>please be a broken record,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>The more we get to the mating,</p>
<p>the more the sex differences present themselves.</p>
<p>They surface.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>And in many psychological domains,</p>
<p>there are no sex differences,</p>
<p>or the sexes are very similar.</p>
<p>But pornography is consumed,</p>
<p>about 80% of the consumers are men.</p>
<p>So, it is very heavily a male consumer industry,</p>
<p>if you will, and I think that</p>
<p>it can have positive and negative effects,</p>
<p>depending on the circumstance.</p>
<p>So, one potential negative effect</p>
<p>is that men might develop unrealistic expectations</p>
<p>about what sex will be like,</p>
<p>or should be like in real life.</p>
<p>And so, I remember actually,</p>
<p>I just heard about this one case of,</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t mention any names,</p>
<p>where a man got married,</p>
<p>and he had been accustomed to seeing very large breasts</p>
<p>in his pornography consumption,</p>
<p>and discovered that his wife</p>
<p>had what he perceived to be very small breasts.</p>
<p>In fact, they were actually just medium size.</p>
<p>But because he had been so heavily exposed to pornography,</p>
<p>and the artificially enhanced breast size</p>
<p>that is often depicted in pornography,</p>
<p>that he had come to expect something that was unrealistic,</p>
<p>in this case, not leading,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not the way to lead off to a great sex life</p>
<p>with your wife by being disappointed in her breast size.</p>
<p>So, I think that people can develop,</p>
<p>in this case, men, unrealistic expectations,</p>
<p>also about the kind of sexual acrobatics</p>
<p>that porn stars engage in,</p>
<p>and when they get in real life situations,</p>
<p>can put pressure on women to become,</p>
<p>to fulfill those kinds of images.</p>
<p>But the other thing,</p>
<p>the other kind of detrimental effect that it has is,</p>
<p>and this is something that is emerging culturally,</p>
<p>is I think it has a dampening effect</p>
<p>on men&rsquo;s pursuit of real life relationships.</p>
<p>Because in some sense,</p>
<p>it kind of bleeds off some of that sex drive,</p>
<p>or sexual desire, or sexual energy.</p>
<p>And so, some men get addicted to it.</p>
<p>So, they&rsquo;re spending hours and hours and hours a day</p>
<p>consuming pornography.</p>
<p>And so, I think it can have a detrimental effect,</p>
<p>even on men&rsquo;s ambition.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s something really powerful</p>
<p>about that sexual energy,</p>
<p>not to be all spiritual about it,</p>
<p>but it seems like that&rsquo;s somehow correlated with ambition.</p>
<p>So, like, one of the things that pornography can take away</p>
<p>is like, exactly as you said,</p>
<p>is your pursuit of love out there,</p>
<p>including women, but also love of things,</p>
<p>meaning like building awesome, epic things.</p>
<p>So, the love of both bridges and women.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Bridge building and relationship building.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s something about that energy.</p>
<p>And also, yeah, there&rsquo;s a sort of a vicious downward spiral,</p>
<p>because it somehow staunts your development</p>
<p>because it limits social interaction,</p>
<p>that the push and pull of romantic social interaction,</p>
<p>it cuts the edge off of that,</p>
<p>and it forces you to spend way too much time with yourself</p>
<p>without the development of that social interaction.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, but there,</p>
<p>so, outside of the expectations</p>
<p>on all those kinds of things,</p>
<p>it seems to have a detrimental effect</p>
<p>on the development of the human mind.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What is that?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t, because some of that is echoed,</p>
<p>and people talk about the metaverse,</p>
<p>that some of our life would be in the digital space.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, on one hand,</p>
<p>well, if it brings you happiness,</p>
<p>if it brings you joy, short-term and long-term,</p>
<p>why isn&rsquo;t the metaverse not the same</p>
<p>or better than the real world?</p>
<p>But there is something still missing.</p>
<p>And what is that?</p>
<p>Something of the pleasure you feel with porn</p>
<p>is still missing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really not representing</p>
<p>some of the fundamental pleasure you feel</p>
<p>when you interact with real people.</p>
<p>And that could be just the growth you experience.</p>
<p>Like, real people can reject you.</p>
<p>The challenge, again, the push and pull,</p>
<p>all of that, the dance of human relations.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, and the exploration of your sexuality.</p>
<p>So, on porn, you can kind of passively explore</p>
<p>because you can see, as you mentioned,</p>
<p>a wide variety of things, and people do that.</p>
<p>But in terms of exploring your own sexuality,</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s no replacement for a real human being.</p>
<p>So, you&rsquo;ve written about violence.</p>
<p>And here, we&rsquo;re talking about porn and sex.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you have thoughts on this,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;d love to ask your opinion on, quote, incels.</p>
<p>So, here, I would like to quote Wikipedia</p>
<p>that define incels as members of an online subculture</p>
<p>of people who define themselves</p>
<p>as unable to get a romantic or sexual partner</p>
<p>despite desiring one.</p>
<p>They also write,</p>
<p>now, I don&rsquo;t know if Wikipedia is the accurate source</p>
<p>about incels, but here it is.</p>
<p>They write, quote, at least eight mass murders</p>
<p>resulting in a total of 61 deaths</p>
<p>have been committed since 2014 by men</p>
<p>who have either self-identified as incels</p>
<p>or who had mentioned incel-related names and writings</p>
<p>in their private writings or internet postings.</p>
<p>Incel communities have been criticized by researchers</p>
<p>and the media for being misogynistic,</p>
<p>encouraging violence, spreading extremist views,</p>
<p>and radicalizing their members.</p>
<p>Is there some insight that you draw</p>
<p>from this connection of sex and lack of sex to violence?</p>
<p>Well, I think sex and violence</p>
<p>are linked in various ways.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not just incels.</p>
<p>So if you look at serial killers, for example,</p>
<p>and this is another thing that I&rsquo;ve,</p>
<p>true crime is kind of an avocation of mine.</p>
<p>I just enjoy reading about true crime</p>
<p>and following true crime stories.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an avocation.</p>
<p>Hobby or side interest.</p>
<p>Super fancy word for hobby, I got it, cool.</p>
<p>Like Ted Bundy, he was actually very charming</p>
<p>and didn&rsquo;t have any trouble attracting women,</p>
<p>but his killing spree started shortly</p>
<p>after he was rejected by a very high status,</p>
<p>attractive woman, and he felt a rage</p>
<p>about being rejected by her.</p>
<p>Now, who knows, that&rsquo;s an N of one,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t know if being rejected</p>
<p>causes serial killing per se,</p>
<p>but sex and violence are related in different ways.</p>
<p>I argue, and I haven&rsquo;t studied</p>
<p>the incel community in detail.</p>
<p>I actually have an incoming graduate student</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s gonna start in the fall</p>
<p>who has been studying the incels,</p>
<p>and so he&rsquo;ll have a more informed picture.</p>
<p>But my attitude is there are ways</p>
<p>to improve your mate value.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re having trouble attracting a mate,</p>
<p>there are ways to improve your mate value</p>
<p>because a lot of things that women want</p>
<p>in a mate are improvable.</p>
<p>Women want guys who are compassionate,</p>
<p>who are understanding, who are ambitious,</p>
<p>who acquire resources, et cetera,</p>
<p>who are physically fit.</p>
<p>There are things you can do to improve your mate value.</p>
<p>And so I would say, rather than,</p>
<p>I would encourage incels or the incel communities,</p>
<p>rather than being hostile toward women</p>
<p>or being angry at women,</p>
<p>just do things to improve your mate value</p>
<p>and then you will be more successful</p>
<p>at attracting women.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, some of it, that&rsquo;s a fascinating,</p>
<p>so your student will be studying that.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a, listen, I love the internet.</p>
<p>The internet always wins.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a fascinating aspect to it,</p>
<p>which is just humor.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m fascinated by seeing the humor,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s 4chan or Reddit and all that kind of stuff,</p>
<p>where people maybe will self-identify as incels as a joke,</p>
<p>as a kind of, basically representing the fact</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s hard to get women.</p>
<p>This is the struggle, the struggle.</p>
<p>And for women, it&rsquo;s hard to get a mate that they,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re basically jokingly representing the challenges</p>
<p>of the mate selection process,</p>
<p>that the desirable group is smaller than the entire group.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re joking about it.</p>
<p>But then it&rsquo;s interesting how quickly humor,</p>
<p>again, the dynamical system, it can turn into anger.</p>
<p>And that, on the internet, is so interesting to watch,</p>
<p>like how trolling, light trolling, is humor,</p>
<p>but it can turn into aggression.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve just seen, it&rsquo;s weird.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s weird how, this is true on the internet,</p>
<p>but you also just look at the dark aspects</p>
<p>of the 20th century that I&rsquo;ve been reading a lot about,</p>
<p>how kind of lighthearted things turn dark quickly.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what to make of it,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s basically sexual frustration</p>
<p>that all humans feel.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s dating in general, can turn into anger,</p>
<p>can turn into sophisticated philosophical constructs,</p>
<p>like about how the world works,</p>
<p>of who really is pulling the strings.</p>
<p>And that turns some of the worst crimes committed</p>
<p>by the Nazis, for example,</p>
<p>or by extremely intelligent people</p>
<p>that constructed models of how the world works.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s something about sexual frustration</p>
<p>is one of the really powerful forces</p>
<p>that could be a catalyst for constructing such models.</p>
<p>And once you&rsquo;ve done that,</p>
<p>shit gets a lot more serious.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s no longer joke, it&rsquo;s serious.</p>
<p>But at the same time, when you just look from the surface,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of jokes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just weird.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s interesting points that you&rsquo;re making.</p>
<p>I think that this is one way</p>
<p>in which evolution has built into us</p>
<p>a feature which is really bad for our overall happiness.</p>
<p>And that is that it&rsquo;s created desires</p>
<p>that can never be fully met.</p>
<p>And that includes in the mating domain.</p>
<p>So even with people who are successful</p>
<p>in attracting somewhat desirable mates,</p>
<p>maybe they want, you know, Giselle B√ºndchen or some,</p>
<p>you know, they desire things that are,</p>
<p>women that are higher in mate value</p>
<p>or a larger number of partners</p>
<p>than they can successfully attract.</p>
<p>And in a way, I mean, these serve as,</p>
<p>evolution&rsquo;s built into these</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re motivational devices.</p>
<p>They motivate us to try to get what we want,</p>
<p>but it also makes us miserable</p>
<p>or at least unhappy or dissatisfied</p>
<p>because there are desires that can never be fulfilled.</p>
<p>And this is, to mention one more sex difference,</p>
<p>this desire for sexual variety,</p>
<p>meaning a variety of different partners,</p>
<p>is much, much greater in men than in women.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s why even like in pornography consumption,</p>
<p>men will like, you know,</p>
<p>go through multiple, multiple, multiple images</p>
<p>and sex scenes and so forth</p>
<p>compared to what women who consume pornography go through.</p>
<p>But this desire for sexual variety</p>
<p>is something that makes men miserable</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s something that they can&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>most men, unless you&rsquo;re a king or a despot</p>
<p>or, you know, have a harem,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s something that can never be fulfilled in everyday life.</p>
<p>And so I even think that, you know,</p>
<p>you talk to men who are walking down a city block</p>
<p>in Austin or New York City or San Francisco or wherever,</p>
<p>and they pass by, they could pass by six women</p>
<p>and feel a sexual attraction</p>
<p>to six different women in one city block, you know?</p>
<p>Now, and so this is, again,</p>
<p>where evolution has created in this</p>
<p>desires that can never be fully met.</p>
<p>And-</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s useful, right?</p>
<p>And the hilarious thing,</p>
<p>now this is always about my own mind,</p>
<p>but just observing people,</p>
<p>once you get that 10 or that beautiful woman</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve been lost,</p>
<p>you take her for granted and move on to the next thing.</p>
<p>There are classic cases like,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you remember this case,</p>
<p>but Hugh Grant was with Elizabeth Hurley,</p>
<p>who is a gorgeous model,</p>
<p>and he was caught having sex with a prostitute,</p>
<p>I think it was in LA or whatever.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s got Elizabeth Hurley,</p>
<p>why are you having sex with a prostitute?</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s the male desire for sexual variety.</p>
<p>Well, let me do a little bit of a tangent here</p>
<p>and ask you about just your work in general</p>
<p>in terms of its interaction with the scientific community</p>
<p>and with the world at large.</p>
<p>So many of the ideas you do research on</p>
<p>are pretty controversial,</p>
<p>or at least the topic is controversial somehow.</p>
<p>Maybe you can speak to that.</p>
<p>But what are your thoughts</p>
<p>in the current climate of cancel culture,</p>
<p>or maybe there&rsquo;s a better term for it,</p>
<p>that word is like loaded now,</p>
<p>about you doing research in this space</p>
<p>that is so essential,</p>
<p>so crucial to understanding human nature?</p>
<p>What are the difficulties?</p>
<p>What are the concerns for you</p>
<p>to be able to freely explore?</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;ve been doing research on these things.</p>
<p>So when you combine sex or sexuality</p>
<p>with sex differences, with evolution,</p>
<p>each of these topics are controversial by themselves,</p>
<p>and you bring them together,</p>
<p>the intersection becomes especially controversial.</p>
<p>But I guess view myself as a scientist,</p>
<p>and so I would rather be scientifically correct</p>
<p>than politically correct, if you will.</p>
<p>So I have no interest in, I don&rsquo;t have an agenda,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have a political agenda,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have any agenda other than discovering human nature.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve devoted my scientific career toward,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s why I do the studies</p>
<p>in responsive to empirical data</p>
<p>and the best theories that we have available,</p>
<p>the best conceptual tools.</p>
<p>So do some of these things upset people?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, they do.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, even early in my career,</p>
<p>before I started publishing on some of these things,</p>
<p>I gave a talk in a sociology department.</p>
<p>This was at University of Michigan,</p>
<p>and a female professor came up to me afterwards and said,</p>
<p>you know, you really shouldn&rsquo;t publish</p>
<p>the results of your studies.</p>
<p>And I said, why not?</p>
<p>And she said that women have it hard enough as it is</p>
<p>without knowing about these things.</p>
<p>And my view is that&rsquo;s naive.</p>
<p>I think suppression of scientific knowledge is a bad thing,</p>
<p>and suppression of scientific knowledge</p>
<p>about sex differences is a bad thing.</p>
<p>Men and women are not psychological clones,</p>
<p>especially when it comes to the mating domain</p>
<p>and sexuality domain.</p>
<p>The only other domain that shows massive sex differences</p>
<p>that we haven&rsquo;t touched on is aggression and violence.</p>
<p>So the leading cause of violence is being a male.</p>
<p>Males have, and the more extreme the violence,</p>
<p>the more males have a monopoly on us.</p>
<p>When you get to homicide, the warfare,</p>
<p>males have a monopoly on it.</p>
<p>And we need to understand human nature,</p>
<p>and we need to understand sex differences therein</p>
<p>in order to be in a position to effectively solve</p>
<p>some of the social problems</p>
<p>that these sex differences create.</p>
<p>So, you know, so I&rsquo;ve been gotten some flack.</p>
<p>No one&rsquo;s tried to cancel me in my work so far.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m-</p>
<p>Just wait.</p>
<p>Yeah, just-</p>
<p>But does it hurt you personally?</p>
<p>Just is it psychologically difficult, you know,</p>
<p>to do this work?</p>
<p>Because what is research is thinking deeply through things</p>
<p>and like doing studies, but also interpreting them</p>
<p>and thinking through what is the right questions to ask.</p>
<p>What does this mean?</p>
<p>And for that, you have to have a clear mind,</p>
<p>an optimistic mind, a free mind, and all of that.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re just a human.</p>
<p>So psychologically, is it difficult?</p>
<p>Does it wear on you?</p>
<p>Yeah, I would say not really,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve been, I think, fortunate.</p>
<p>So even say my latest book,</p>
<p>I published a book recently on conflict between the sexes,</p>
<p>and it deals with very controversial topics,</p>
<p>including intimate partner violence,</p>
<p>like with the Johnny Depp, Amber Heard thing.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t talk about that in the book,</p>
<p>but, and it&rsquo;s been largely well-received,</p>
<p>you know, and I think partly it&rsquo;s because I am careful</p>
<p>in my publications not to endorse it.</p>
<p>So one of the common conflations that people make</p>
<p>is they think that it&rsquo;s something that you think is good,</p>
<p>you know, that, you know, if you find a sex difference,</p>
<p>that there should be a sex difference.</p>
<p>This is the is-ought confusion.</p>
<p>And so I try to make it very clear</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m studying what is not what ought to be.</p>
<p>And a lot of things that I discover about what is the case,</p>
<p>I would prefer them not to be.</p>
<p>And I think, you kind of alluded to this earlier</p>
<p>by saying that we have to override</p>
<p>some of our violent inclinations or impulses,</p>
<p>or the way I would phrase it is we have to-</p>
<p>Control them?</p>
<p>Control or keep quiescent or suppress</p>
<p>some of the nastier sides of human nature.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve successfully done that in some domains.</p>
<p>So you can talk about, like one group that fascinates me</p>
<p>is the Vikings and the whole, that whole era.</p>
<p>And so you have, in Sweden, Norway, for example,</p>
<p>these have like the lowest homicide rates on earth.</p>
<p>But you go back 400 years ago, 600 years ago,</p>
<p>people were killing each other right and left, you know?</p>
<p>And so finding that, so this leads me to be optimistic</p>
<p>that we can change conditions</p>
<p>to suppress our evolved proclivities.</p>
<p>Just like one physical example that I sometimes use</p>
<p>is callous-producing mechanisms.</p>
<p>We have evolved callous-producing mechanisms</p>
<p>that are very valuable.</p>
<p>We develop thickness in the areas of our skin</p>
<p>that have experienced repeated friction.</p>
<p>But we can, in principle, design environments</p>
<p>where we don&rsquo;t experience repeated friction.</p>
<p>And so we won&rsquo;t grow callouses.</p>
<p>And so you&rsquo;ve designed an environment</p>
<p>that basically prevents the activation</p>
<p>of our callous-producing mechanism.</p>
<p>I think we can do the same thing</p>
<p>with some of these other inclinations</p>
<p>and have succeeded in, you know, reductions of homicide</p>
<p>even in the last couple hundred years.</p>
<p>And some of that has to do with the myths and stories</p>
<p>we tell ourselves, like again, it&rsquo;s language.</p>
<p>Because I mean, I love the Vikings.</p>
<p>I mean, I love the Vikings.</p>
<p>Valhalla, that idea.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a myth, that&rsquo;s an idea,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a promise for the great land beyond,</p>
<p>over there beyond the mountains.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like Animal Farm, Sugarcane Mountain.</p>
<p>That is promised to you if you&rsquo;re a great warrior.</p>
<p>I believe Valhalla is where half the soldiers go</p>
<p>as a reward for great soldiering, for being great warriors.</p>
<p>And the thing I just recently have been reading</p>
<p>quite a bit about Valhalla,</p>
<p>which is it&rsquo;s such a fascinating</p>
<p>how these myths are constructed.</p>
<p>I believe, I just think this is such an awesome setup</p>
<p>in terms of a kind of heaven,</p>
<p>which is they spend the entire day fighting</p>
<p>for joy, and if they die, they&rsquo;re reborn the next day.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s, you&rsquo;re basically the passion,</p>
<p>the thing you&rsquo;re passionate about without the consequences.</p>
<p>On top of that, I think there&rsquo;s a pig or a boar</p>
<p>that is, they keep eating.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s regenerated every single day.</p>
<p>So unlimited food, and there&rsquo;s unlimited beer, I believe.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like-</p>
<p>Or mead, maybe.</p>
<p>Mead, mead, yes, yes, yes, yes, it&rsquo;s mead.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, that&rsquo;s fascinating</p>
<p>that we construct these myths.</p>
<p>And at the same time,</p>
<p>these myths can be used to get humans</p>
<p>to do some of the worst atrocities.</p>
<p>So some of the violence requires us to have those myths</p>
<p>of what is waiting for us beyond death,</p>
<p>sort of beyond over there in Sugarcane Mountain,</p>
<p>as Crow says that in Animal Farm.</p>
<p>And so I think the more and more in this modern society,</p>
<p>the positive of not constructing so many myths</p>
<p>is that we get to live more in the moment,</p>
<p>and that forces us to optimize and improve the moment,</p>
<p>and we get to face the irrational</p>
<p>and the painful aspect of violence.</p>
<p>Maybe we should reduce that in the here and now.</p>
<p>Yeah, the downside is we may not,</p>
<p>if we dispose of God or these kinds of religious</p>
<p>and spiritual ideas,</p>
<p>we might descend into what Nietzsche</p>
<p>worried about with nihilism.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a beautiful dance,</p>
<p>because humans seem to tie themselves</p>
<p>together with narratives.</p>
<p>Yes, yeah.</p>
<p>And with myths and stories that we all believe,</p>
<p>if you completely dispose of them,</p>
<p>society, I don&rsquo;t know, we don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s going to happen,</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s going to collapse,</p>
<p>or if it&rsquo;s actually going to rediscover better myths,</p>
<p>better stories, more scientifically grounded ones,</p>
<p>ones that are driven in data and all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s an interesting question.</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t have any brilliant insights into it</p>
<p>other than that, you know,</p>
<p>to agree with you that people construct narratives,</p>
<p>well, of their own lives,</p>
<p>and sometimes the life after death.</p>
<p>But I guess I would add,</p>
<p>and this is maybe a more cynical view,</p>
<p>but you mentioned atrocities.</p>
<p>I think that leaders can sometimes exploit</p>
<p>those under them to create</p>
<p>forms of violence or justification for warfare.</p>
<p>Like in, you know, like the group that we are conquering,</p>
<p>they are a subhuman, they&rsquo;re insects,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re an infectious disease that is, you know,</p>
<p>and so these narratives can be used by leaders</p>
<p>to exploit and motivate people under them</p>
<p>to commit these atrocities.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a nastier part of our psychology,</p>
<p>both that leaders do that,</p>
<p>but also that people are vulnerable</p>
<p>to narratives of that sort.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s fascinating to look pre-internet.</p>
<p>You hope the internet makes us more resistant to that,</p>
<p>which I do have probably a question on that.</p>
<p>But if you look at just the propaganda machines</p>
<p>during World War II,</p>
<p>on the Nazi side and on the Soviet side,</p>
<p>on every side, but particularly in those two,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so fascinating both how effective</p>
<p>a simple message can be in a leader being able</p>
<p>to convince the small inner circle around them,</p>
<p>convince themselves, which is fascinating,</p>
<p>propaganda, you start to believe</p>
<p>the propaganda you generate,</p>
<p>and then how easily the populace is convincible.</p>
<p>Again, you hope that the internet,</p>
<p>the distributed nature of the internet,</p>
<p>makes it more difficult to run a propaganda campaign,</p>
<p>at least of the classical sort.</p>
<p>I do have a question about this,</p>
<p>because you mentioned Elon Musk,</p>
<p>when we&rsquo;re talking about status hierarchies,</p>
<p>like you and I can&rsquo;t buy Twitter.</p>
<p>And wealth accumulation, yeah.</p>
<p>What do you think about Elon buying Twitter,</p>
<p>in particular, in the reason, the state of reason,</p>
<p>that he&rsquo;s doing so in emphasizing free speech?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an interesting question,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t really have an informed opinion about it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, it&rsquo;s not my area of expertise,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t know enough details.</p>
<p>And I also don&rsquo;t know what his plans are for Twitter,</p>
<p>what changes he proposes to implement.</p>
<p>Well, the reason I bring that up is because,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve kind of said you don&rsquo;t necessarily</p>
<p>feel a tremendous amount of pressure,</p>
<p>but in doing controversial research,</p>
<p>in doing research on controversial topics,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re also a communicator,</p>
<p>and Twitter is a platform in which you communicate.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s going to be, if you get canceled somewhere,</p>
<p>you get canceled on Twitter.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s pressure.</p>
<p>So what does free speech look like in these public platforms?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s communicating difficult ideas.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s changing your mind, it&rsquo;s exploring ideas,</p>
<p>and not fearing the mob.</p>
<p>The mob that pressures the platform</p>
<p>to remove you from the platform,</p>
<p>or to ban you, shadow ban you from the platform,</p>
<p>decrease your reach artificially on the platform.</p>
<p>And those are really fascinating questions</p>
<p>that we get to deal with in this new digital age.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a lot of ideas.</p>
<p>You said what Elon is planning to do.</p>
<p>Forget Elon, how do you do this well?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the question.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s sort of an absolutist view of free speech,</p>
<p>let anyone say anything.</p>
<p>And I tend to be a person that believes</p>
<p>everybody should have the freedom to say anything.</p>
<p>The question with a social media platform is,</p>
<p>well, can you force anyone to hear what you have to say?</p>
<p>Because the virality, the viral nature of communication</p>
<p>means that you can control who hears what you say.</p>
<p>The virality of that, the search and discovery aspect.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s a fascinating question</p>
<p>from the algorithmic perspective.</p>
<p>The amount of data out there, just like papers,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a huge amount of papers.</p>
<p>What you want is to find the best papers,</p>
<p>the ones you agree with,</p>
<p>but also the ones that challenge you.</p>
<p>And you don&rsquo;t want to nonstop read</p>
<p>the papers that challenge you.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to be mentally exhausted.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a bucket of attention and focus</p>
<p>and mental energy you can allocate.</p>
<p>The ones that really challenge you,</p>
<p>the ideas that really challenge you are exhausting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s good, just like going to the gym, it&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>But then you also want to read things that are fun for you.</p>
<p>And those are, you know,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re spending your whole life in arguments,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to be exhausting.</p>
<p>You want to hang out, chill with your friends,</p>
<p>watch Netflix, have fun, whatever, easygoing.</p>
<p>And sometimes have difficult academic arguments</p>
<p>with people, for example, with people you disagree with,</p>
<p>but not all the time.</p>
<p>And you have to have a platform.</p>
<p>What does free speech actually looks like?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a platform where everybody can challenge anybody,</p>
<p>but not destroy them by doing so mentally.</p>
<p>So you have to balance personal growth</p>
<p>of each individual person on the platform.</p>
<p>But definitely removing people from a platform</p>
<p>is a terrible thing.</p>
<p>So on top of that, it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>how do you get measures that the platform is doing good?</p>
<p>What I really like what Elon said,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve talked to him about this,</p>
<p>is pissing off everybody equally,</p>
<p>the extremes of every side equally.</p>
<p>In the political spectrum,</p>
<p>you could say the left and the right</p>
<p>is measuring by pissing off the extremes equally,</p>
<p>because currently there seems to be an asymmetry in that.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s one good measure</p>
<p>that allows you to maximize, as he says,</p>
<p>the area under the curve of human happiness.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one thing.</p>
<p>The other is people representing themselves honestly.</p>
<p>So removing the bots from the platform.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s such a weird world we live in</p>
<p>where you don&rsquo;t know who&rsquo;s real or not.</p>
<p>So anonymity is an awesome thing.</p>
<p>The awesome aspect of anonymity</p>
<p>is it protects people&rsquo;s privacy.</p>
<p>It actually gives them freedom to think,</p>
<p>freedom to speak even more so.</p>
<p>But when anonymity is weaponized,</p>
<p>it allows you to be cruel to others</p>
<p>without the repercussion of cruelty</p>
<p>that you would feel in the physical world.</p>
<p>So you wanna use anonymity as a shield versus as a sword.</p>
<p>So to protect yourself from the attacks of others,</p>
<p>but not as a way to hurt others.</p>
<p>And those are all really tricky things to figure out.</p>
<p>And not all of it&rsquo;s gonna be solved with an edit button,</p>
<p>which I believe is the most requested Twitter feature.</p>
<p>Anyway, I think this is fascinating,</p>
<p>not just for people talking about politics,</p>
<p>which is what everyone seems to care about,</p>
<p>but also for science,</p>
<p>for people challenging each other in the scientific domain.</p>
<p>Because I at least have hope for scientific communication</p>
<p>where people can start playing around</p>
<p>with different mediums of communication.</p>
<p>So not just academic papers,</p>
<p>but just ideas, playing with those ideas.</p>
<p>Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>Especially when you have, so evolutionary psychology,</p>
<p>well, no, even that, it can be super high turnover rate</p>
<p>of importance.</p>
<p>But you have with COVID,</p>
<p>it seems like the progress of science and scientific debate</p>
<p>is most powerful in that context</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s done really quickly.</p>
<p>And it feels like Twitter,</p>
<p>like most of the best things I&rsquo;ve learned about COVID,</p>
<p>to stay up to date, was on Twitter.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so exciting to see science happening so, so, so quickly</p>
<p>in all kinds of domains there.</p>
<p>And that was great.</p>
<p>But then you step in with labels of what&rsquo;s misinformation,</p>
<p>you have this kind of conformity seeking labels</p>
<p>of what is true and not,</p>
<p>which is a very unscientific thing to me,</p>
<p>in the name of protecting the populace.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a weird impulse that people have,</p>
<p>which is, well, here&rsquo;s an organization,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s an institution that is a possessor of the truth,</p>
<p>and everybody else is untrue.</p>
<p>Now, a lot of the time, maybe majority of the time,</p>
<p>that institution is going to be correct.</p>
<p>This consensus.</p>
<p>Consensus is the consensus because it&rsquo;s usually correct.</p>
<p>But the biggest ideas are going to be against the consensus.</p>
<p>And certainly that&rsquo;s true in evolutionary psychology,</p>
<p>where it seems like, are we even, is the cake even baked yet?</p>
<p>It feels like there&rsquo;s a lot of turmoil</p>
<p>in terms of figuring out human psychology.</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s a lot that we don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I mean, if human psychology, if it were a simple thing</p>
<p>and we only had, you know,</p>
<p>three or half a dozen psychological adaptations,</p>
<p>we would have discovered all of them by now.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that it&rsquo;s so complex, multi-faceted, multi-mechanism</p>
<p>part that describes human nature</p>
<p>that it was what makes it exciting,</p>
<p>but also the amount that we know is small</p>
<p>compared to the amount that we don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s why you have to approach these things</p>
<p>with a certain humility.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why even like in the mating and sexuality domain,</p>
<p>which I&rsquo;ve been studying for a number of years,</p>
<p>I keep coming across things that I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>questions that are unanswered,</p>
<p>which makes it exciting from my perspective.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s what the joy is of being a scientist.</p>
<p>You mentioned, I gotta return real quick to Ted Bundy.</p>
<p>You mentioned you have,</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;ve written about murder and violence</p>
<p>in a long distant past,</p>
<p>but the thread runs through your work today.</p>
<p>Who to you is the most fascinating serial killer</p>
<p>of the true crime things that you&rsquo;ve explored?</p>
<p>I think, well, Ted Bundy&rsquo;s way up there.</p>
<p>I think Charles Manson is another.</p>
<p>Have you seen on Ted Bundy,</p>
<p>because I find him super fascinating.</p>
<p>Have you seen, there&rsquo;s a lot of movies on him,</p>
<p>extremely wicked, shockingly evil and vile.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a retelling of his life</p>
<p>from the perspective of his long-term girlfriend.</p>
<p>No, I have not seen that one yet.</p>
<p>Which ties together a lot of our conversation.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s probably my favorite one.</p>
<p>A lot of people say it&rsquo;s the best movie on Ted Bundy.</p>
<p>So you should definitely watch it.</p>
<p>I will.</p>
<p>I recommend it to others,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s from a perspective of the relationship.</p>
<p>And it just,</p>
<p>one of the really powerful windows</p>
<p>into a serial killer that I saw there</p>
<p>is that from the perspective of the relationship,</p>
<p>you can have just this healthy looking relationship.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s some fights and so on,</p>
<p>but the usual dating and all that kind of stuff</p>
<p>was all there.</p>
<p>So all the murders he was doing,</p>
<p>he had a long-term girlfriend throughout all of that.</p>
<p>And also throughout all of that,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll try not to give away</p>
<p>in case you don&rsquo;t know the story,</p>
<p>throughout all of that, she stood by his side.</p>
<p>She refused to believe everything that was happening</p>
<p>until the very end.</p>
<p>Of course, it shifts in the very end,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s a fascinating shift,</p>
<p>the breaking of the illusion.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s really fascinating</p>
<p>that you can have those two things.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, I think that part of it is</p>
<p>we have these stereotypes</p>
<p>that we expect people like serial killers</p>
<p>to be these ugly, drooling creatures</p>
<p>that are sort of evil all the time.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s why even like you had,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;m remembering this correctly,</p>
<p>but like Stalin who killed millions of people,</p>
<p>apparently loved his kids and loved his family and people.</p>
<p>So we have, that&rsquo;s part of the complication,</p>
<p>the complexity of human nature and human psychology</p>
<p>is we don&rsquo;t have just this one,</p>
<p>this one property that dictates</p>
<p>how we behave in all circumstances.</p>
<p>Yeah, the devil is going to be charismatic.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why, that&rsquo;s one of the things I&rsquo;ve learned</p>
<p>about just looking at evil people,</p>
<p>looking at Jeffrey Epstein,</p>
<p>who seemed to have hoodwinked quite a lot of people.</p>
<p>Yes, yeah, that&rsquo;s another fascinating case.</p>
<p>Yeah, he wasn&rsquo;t a serial killer,</p>
<p>but a serial sexual predator.</p>
<p>And a lot of people I know and respect</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t see the evil.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And so I never met the guy,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s like, are you guys oblivious?</p>
<p>Like what was, there must&rsquo;ve been something,</p>
<p>from everything I see is purely just charisma.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the smoke and mirrors that-</p>
<p>Yeah, well, he was a very charming psychopath.</p>
<p>Yeah, but I think every psychopath</p>
<p>to be effective has to be charming.</p>
<p>Yeah, the successful ones, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, successful psychopaths.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>And that was, I mean, Ted Bundy was one.</p>
<p>He was a good-looking guy, intelligent,</p>
<p>and could turn on the charm, and then had this evil.</p>
<p>Is there something interesting to be said</p>
<p>that I think a large percentage of the fan base,</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;ve seen numbers like 80% plus</p>
<p>of the fan base for true crime shows is women?</p>
<p>Is there some psychology behind that?</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t seen that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not aware if, a sex difference that I&rsquo;m not aware of.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;ve heard that in a lot of places,</p>
<p>so I wonder if there&rsquo;s something about true crime,</p>
<p>maybe because it&rsquo;s just like sexual kinks</p>
<p>for men develop early on, the cues.</p>
<p>Maybe for women, there&rsquo;s the cues of the threat of violence.</p>
<p>The attentiveness to violence develops early on,</p>
<p>and therefore, fascination with violence.</p>
<p>Well, I think that, I mean, one thing is that,</p>
<p>well, with serial killers specifically,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if this is true of true crime in general,</p>
<p>but serial killers, you find a lot of people,</p>
<p>well, a lot of women fall in love with them,</p>
<p>or even if they&rsquo;re jailed for serial killing,</p>
<p>and I think one of the features of it</p>
<p>is that it parasitizes or hijacks status mechanisms</p>
<p>in that a key cue to status is the attention structure.</p>
<p>That is, the high-status people are the people</p>
<p>to whom the most people pay the most attention,</p>
<p>and so serial killers garner a lot of attention,</p>
<p>and even though for evil deeds, it&rsquo;s still attention.</p>
<p>So I think that that hijacking</p>
<p>of our status allocation adaptations</p>
<p>is partly responsible for that.</p>
<p>Is there, given the trajectory of your life,</p>
<p>you mentioned Berkeley and the East Coast and Michigan,</p>
<p>you got everything.</p>
<p>Is there, given the trajectory of your life</p>
<p>in geography and in science,</p>
<p>can you give advice to young folks today,</p>
<p>high school, college,</p>
<p>thinking about how to make their own trajectory,</p>
<p>how to make their own way through life</p>
<p>that they can be proud of,</p>
<p>either career or just love life or life?</p>
<p>Yeah, well, not necessarily on careers,</p>
<p>but I can give advice on mating,</p>
<p>and I think it&rsquo;s one of these things</p>
<p>where we have requirements for the courses</p>
<p>that students have to take in high school, for example,</p>
<p>and I think there should be a required course</p>
<p>on relationships, on mating.</p>
<p>So not just sex.</p>
<p>Yeah, not just sex at all.</p>
<p>Most of what&rsquo;s taught is they teach about sexual health</p>
<p>and how not to get an STI and so forth.</p>
<p>Yeah, my teacher put a condom on a banana.</p>
<p>Right, right.</p>
<p>It was very exciting.</p>
<p>But how to select a mate?</p>
<p>How do you know if you&rsquo;re in a bad mating relationship?</p>
<p>How to get out of a bad mating relationship?</p>
<p>I think that there&rsquo;s, at this point in the science,</p>
<p>even though there&rsquo;s a lot that we don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>we know enough to at least provide some heuristics</p>
<p>or general guidelines to things to watch out for.</p>
<p>So just as a concrete example,</p>
<p>with intimate partner violence,</p>
<p>and this is male to female,</p>
<p>there are statistical predictors of,</p>
<p>is this guy, does he have an increased probability</p>
<p>of beating you up?</p>
<p>And there are things like,</p>
<p>if he starts to insist on knowing</p>
<p>where you are at all times,</p>
<p>if he starts cutting off your relationships</p>
<p>with your friends and your family.</p>
<p>So there are these kind of early warning signs,</p>
<p>and I think women should know about those.</p>
<p>Or even things like that women are most in danger</p>
<p>of being killed by an ex during the first three</p>
<p>to six months after they&rsquo;ve broken up with him.</p>
<p>That sometimes they think it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>the guy will say, meet with me one last time,</p>
<p>and then I won&rsquo;t bother you again.</p>
<p>No, this is a dangerous time.</p>
<p>So I think there&rsquo;s some knowledge that we do know</p>
<p>that can be used to make informed decisions</p>
<p>about our mating lives,</p>
<p>and I think that should be taught.</p>
<p>So consider that,</p>
<p>like take the mating strategies,</p>
<p>the mating life seriously.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>And because, aside from a small number of people</p>
<p>who are totally uninterested in any kind of mating</p>
<p>or sexuality, and there are a small percentage</p>
<p>that fall into that category,</p>
<p>we all confront problems of mating.</p>
<p>How do you, you know there&rsquo;s that,</p>
<p>called the mathematical model,</p>
<p>like secretary problem, marriage problem.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;re familiar,</p>
<p>but basically you have, it&rsquo;s a silly, perhaps not,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a formalized, simplified queuing theory type of thing</p>
<p>where you have N subjects,</p>
<p>and you get to date some number of people,</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s a stopping condition,</p>
<p>I believe it&rsquo;s N over E,</p>
<p>beyond which you pick the next partner,</p>
<p>which is better than anybody you&rsquo;ve dated before.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s not overemphasize that idea,</p>
<p>but if I were to psychologize it,</p>
<p>I would say that some exploration is good,</p>
<p>some dating is good,</p>
<p>but at a certain point you pick somebody,</p>
<p>given the set of people you&rsquo;ve explored,</p>
<p>you pick somebody who is pretty desirable</p>
<p>within that group.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, but I would add that what you also wanna do</p>
<p>is you want to mate with someone</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s equivalent in mate value,</p>
<p>or has even what&rsquo;s more difficult</p>
<p>is has a likely equivalent future mate value trajectory,</p>
<p>because nothing remains static.</p>
<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s beautiful.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s also the case that there are individual things,</p>
<p>we haven&rsquo;t talked about these,</p>
<p>but things like religious orientation,</p>
<p>political orientation, values,</p>
<p>these are extremely important to be compatible on.</p>
<p>You do have cases of, let&rsquo;s say,</p>
<p>a Democrat marrying a Republican,</p>
<p>and that sometimes works,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re gonna get into a lot of conflict,</p>
<p>other things being equal,</p>
<p>or someone who&rsquo;s deeply religious</p>
<p>versus someone who is not at all religious,</p>
<p>this is gonna be a problem,</p>
<p>or someone who&rsquo;s of a different religious faith.</p>
<p>And so compatibility on those things,</p>
<p>compatibility also on personality dimensions,</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s some main effects,</p>
<p>so I would recommend avoiding that dimension</p>
<p>we talked about of emotional instability,</p>
<p>because if you sign up for that,</p>
<p>you at least should know</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna be in for a lot of conflict.</p>
<p>It may be exciting at times,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s gonna be a lot of ups and downs.</p>
<p>Know what you sign up for.</p>
<p>What about how much to date?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a culture,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m speaking soon to a founder</p>
<p>and longtime ex-CEO of Tinder,</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s that culture of digitalized dating,</p>
<p>of swipe right, swipe left.</p>
<p>Is it positive, negative?</p>
<p>How much should you date?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the number?</p>
<p>And also, what number of sexual partners should you,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s optimal, asking for a friend?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if there&rsquo;s a single optimum there.</p>
<p>I was hoping there was.</p>
<p>I think that-</p>
<p>Is it single digits or double digits?</p>
<p>I need answers.</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I get some of my wisdom from lyrics, from songs.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s this Eagles song,</p>
<p>I think Don Henley said something like,</p>
<p>there are too many lovers in one lifetime,</p>
<p>ain&rsquo;t good for you, or something like that.</p>
<p>But I think there is a-</p>
<p>Take it easy is a good one too.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Or basically don&rsquo;t get too attached.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t take heartbreak too seriously.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So, but I think, I mean, internet dating,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s been some work on them,</p>
<p>I think has its pluses and minuses.</p>
<p>And one of the pluses is it gives you access</p>
<p>to potential pools of mates</p>
<p>that you could never possibly meet in real life,</p>
<p>where mating and dating used to be either people you knew</p>
<p>or friends of friends, or you go out to bars or parties.</p>
<p>But so that&rsquo;s the good thing,</p>
<p>gives you access to those extended pools.</p>
<p>But also it gives people the illusion</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s always someone better out there for you.</p>
<p>Someone who&rsquo;s just a little more attractive,</p>
<p>a little more compatible, a little more.</p>
<p>And so it produces what&rsquo;s sometimes</p>
<p>called decision paralysis.</p>
<p>You have too many options and you can&rsquo;t choose.</p>
<p>I think one other potential negative,</p>
<p>which I think could be corrected</p>
<p>by these internet dating sites,</p>
<p>is that the picture, the photographs of the face and body</p>
<p>tend to overwhelm all other sources of information.</p>
<p>And so, especially if you&rsquo;re just looking for a sex partner,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s one thing, physical appearances,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s fine for that to be overwhelmingly important.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re looking for a long-term mate,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so many other things</p>
<p>that are really, really important.</p>
<p>And so, but people tend to be swamped by the visual input,</p>
<p>which is natural because that&rsquo;s where we evolved</p>
<p>to respond to visual input.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not evolved to respond to words,</p>
<p>like, oh, I like to go fishing or something like that.</p>
<p>So if there&rsquo;s some way for these sites to,</p>
<p>in long-term mating, for these other characteristics</p>
<p>to be made more salient in people&rsquo;s information processing,</p>
<p>I think that would be a valuable improvement.</p>
<p>Yeah, because even, forget long-term beauty,</p>
<p>even sex appeal is, like even the word appearance,</p>
<p>it feels like, to me, people that are super sexy</p>
<p>in real life are a lot more than their picture.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Like, it&rsquo;s actually surprising,</p>
<p>like they come to life in different ways.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>It could be either submissiveness as shyness</p>
<p>or extravagant wit and humor,</p>
<p>or like super confident or super,</p>
<p>like whatever they are,</p>
<p>whatever the weirdness that they are comes through.</p>
<p>So when people say, well,</p>
<p>which is the case of sort of proponents of dating apps,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, well, when you meet somebody at a bar,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re getting the same experience as you do</p>
<p>on a dating site.</p>
<p>You have very little information.</p>
<p>All you get is appearance.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t think appearance on the screen</p>
<p>is the same as appearance in real life,</p>
<p>especially with people that, for some reason,</p>
<p>you find super sexy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, and again, the objectification</p>
<p>that we mentioned earlier is the,</p>
<p>it over-optimizes for people</p>
<p>who are good at taking pictures of themselves.</p>
<p>Like, they&rsquo;re representing themselves inaccurately.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not just even in the physical features,</p>
<p>but in the way those physical features</p>
<p>are used in physical reality,</p>
<p>like in terms of body language,</p>
<p>in terms of flirtation,</p>
<p>in terms of just everything, everything put together.</p>
<p>So I just, I wonder if there&rsquo;s a way to close that,</p>
<p>to close that gap.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know what that is exactly.</p>
<p>I tend to believe more information is good on dating.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t use, actually, dating apps.</p>
<p>I just, because they don&rsquo;t make any sense to me,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s not enough information.</p>
<p>Like, what this, like, to me,</p>
<p>like, whether you know Dostoevsky or not is important.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t mean that because you&rsquo;ve read, specifically,</p>
<p>a book by Dostoevsky, but there&rsquo;s something about,</p>
<p>have you suffered?</p>
<p>Have you thought about life deeply?</p>
<p>Have you been shaken in some way?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not, sometimes books can reveal that.</p>
<p>Sometimes something else can reveal that.</p>
<p>But this kind of very shallow resume,</p>
<p>like, I like to travel.</p>
<p>I have boobs.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like this kind of thing is,</p>
<p>it loses the humanity of it all.</p>
<p>I want, because, listen, as a fan of technology,</p>
<p>I would love dating to open up, like you said,</p>
<p>the pool of possibilities out there.</p>
<p>But the soulmate idea, like,</p>
<p>I believe that there&rsquo;s an incredible people out there</p>
<p>for you that is an emotional connection,</p>
<p>not just a physical connection.</p>
<p>And so that the promise of digital tech</p>
<p>is that you can discover those people.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not just for a romantic relationship,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s for friendships, it&rsquo;s for business partners,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s for all that kind of stuff, like your friend groups.</p>
<p>But yeah, there&rsquo;s something,</p>
<p>seems broken about dating sites.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, that&rsquo;s why, I mean,</p>
<p>when I&rsquo;m asked for advice on this,</p>
<p>I say, if you feel like you have a connection with someone,</p>
<p>meet them in person, meet them in real life.</p>
<p>Because-</p>
<p>And take the road trip, like you said.</p>
<p>Yeah, take the road trip.</p>
<p>Stress test it.</p>
<p>Yes, yeah.</p>
<p>Because there&rsquo;s only, I mean,</p>
<p>so much you can learn through messaging and so forth.</p>
<p>Amongst all of this, we didn&rsquo;t really,</p>
<p>we didn&rsquo;t really mention love, which is hilarious.</p>
<p>So let me ask you, in the last just few questions,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the role of love in all of this</p>
<p>in the human condition?</p>
<p>So we talked about mating, we talked about mate selection,</p>
<p>we talked about all the things we find attractive in a mate,</p>
<p>the status hierarchies and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>What about that deep connection with a human being</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s hard to explain?</p>
<p>Well, we talked about it a little bit,</p>
<p>but so we&rsquo;re talking about love, like romantic love.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s an evolved emotion that evolved in part</p>
<p>to solidify long-term pair bonds.</p>
<p>And is it different from the love of a parent for a child</p>
<p>or brotherly love or sisterly love or other friendship love?</p>
<p>I think these are different phenomena.</p>
<p>But if we&rsquo;re talking about romantic love,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s an evolved emotion.</p>
<p>Leading hypothesis is that it&rsquo;s a commitment device.</p>
<p>So if I say to a potential mate,</p>
<p>oh, you exceed my minimum thresholds on intelligence</p>
<p>and looks, I think we make a good couple.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good pickup line.</p>
<p>Yeah, it wouldn&rsquo;t do much emotionally.</p>
<p>But if you say, I love you,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s I can&rsquo;t stop thinking about you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s this uncontrollable emotion that I feel toward you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a sign that I&rsquo;m committed to you at least for a while.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not gonna abandon you when an 8.5 comes along.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not gonna drop you and go with the 8.5.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s so interesting.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s still the reality of the emotion is there.</p>
<p>However, it evolved, it&rsquo;s still there.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of the more puzzling pieces here.</p>
<p>Even broader than romantic love,</p>
<p>but in romantic love, what is that?</p>
<p>How much of that is nature?</p>
<p>How much of it is nurture?</p>
<p>Because even, I mean, I ask that myself all the time.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m deeply romantic.</p>
<p>How much of that is nature?</p>
<p>How much of it is nurture?</p>
<p>How much is the people I spent my childhood with,</p>
<p>the ideas, I mean, the Soviet Union sort of is known</p>
<p>for the literature and the movies and so on</p>
<p>that are very over, they&rsquo;re heavily romanticized.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna say over romanticized.</p>
<p>Maybe there&rsquo;s no such thing.</p>
<p>But so maybe, what is that?</p>
<p>Is that my upbringing?</p>
<p>Or is that somewhere in the genetics</p>
<p>that I value that emotional connection?</p>
<p>Yeah, well, most humans have the capacity for love.</p>
<p>Whether it is activated in any individual person</p>
<p>such as you or anyone else,</p>
<p>it is gonna be adjusted or suppressed</p>
<p>by different social and cultural and upbringing factors.</p>
<p>I mean, there are cultures where parents</p>
<p>basically lock away girls, they cloister them,</p>
<p>and so they can&rsquo;t ever meet anyone else</p>
<p>until the parents arranged to marry them.</p>
<p>So they override any possibility of love.</p>
<p>But I think it&rsquo;s an evolved emotion.</p>
<p>And I mean, one kind of test of this,</p>
<p>and this is just slightly circumstantial evidence,</p>
<p>but in China historically, there have been arranged marriages</p>
<p>and then individual choice marriages.</p>
<p>The arranged marriages tend to have higher breakup rates</p>
<p>and lower child production</p>
<p>than the ones that are sort of voluntarily chosen,</p>
<p>so called matriarchs.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard sort of contrasting stuff from India.</p>
<p>I wonder, contrasting where the arranged marriages</p>
<p>are longer lasting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so interesting, because you said China.</p>
<p>I would love to see the data and the dance of that</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s a lot of other interesting factors,</p>
<p>like how the arranged marriage is arranged.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Is it for the families?</p>
<p>Is the interest of the families</p>
<p>for some kind of like in the monarchies</p>
<p>to make agreements to trade resources,</p>
<p>or is the interest of the family</p>
<p>to maximize the success of the marriage?</p>
<p>So compatibility, is it,</p>
<p>are they looking for maximized compatibility</p>
<p>or are they looking to maximize resources?</p>
<p>Well, historically, it&rsquo;s often been an arrangement</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re trying to maximize the status and power</p>
<p>of the alliance with this other extended family.</p>
<p>But that also varies from culture to culture.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s the Tiwi culture where there&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>the men basically bestow their daughters on other men,</p>
<p>and they try to gauge which men,</p>
<p>which of these young up-and-coming men</p>
<p>are really gonna be chiefs, high-status guys,</p>
<p>and which ones are gonna be losers.</p>
<p>And so you have this weird phenomenon.</p>
<p>They have a polygynous marriage</p>
<p>where a guy will get one daughter bestowed on him,</p>
<p>and then other men use that as information</p>
<p>that this guy must be rising in status,</p>
<p>and so they give their daughters to the guy as well.</p>
<p>And so the guy might go from like zero to seven wives</p>
<p>in a very short span of time.</p>
<p>Yeah, the rich get richer.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>The Game of Thrones, and sex is a part of that game.</p>
<p>Let me ask you about yourself, your own self.</p>
<p>We mentioned Richard Wrangham.</p>
<p>Think about mortality.</p>
<p>Do you think about your own mortality?</p>
<p>Are you afraid of death?</p>
<p>Yeah, interesting.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not afraid of death.</p>
<p>I agree with Richard Wrangham.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not eager to leave the party.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna leave the party soon.</p>
<p>I enjoy life in all of its interesting complexities.</p>
<p>I enjoy my scientific work.</p>
<p>I enjoy my relationships with other people.</p>
<p>I enjoy exploring the universe.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not eager to leave, but I&rsquo;m not afraid of it.</p>
<p>And I think part of that is that I was married for a while</p>
<p>and my wife died prematurely of cancer.</p>
<p>And so I spent basically eight months</p>
<p>with her watching her die after she was diagnosed.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s some, it was a horrible time for me</p>
<p>and for her, obviously, but there&rsquo;s some way</p>
<p>in which it kind of made it more familiar</p>
<p>so that it became a lot less frightening.</p>
<p>How did that experience change you?</p>
<p>Just as a scientist, as a thinker about humanity,</p>
<p>or as a human yourself?</p>
<p>Well, I guess-</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re saying you felt like you felt</p>
<p>a little bit more ready for this whole end of the party?</p>
<p>Well, yeah, it&rsquo;s, I mean,</p>
<p>because we tend to be afraid of things</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re not familiar with, you know?</p>
<p>And so if you&rsquo;re familiar with it,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, at least in my case,</p>
<p>that caused a lessening of fear on that dimension.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t know, it also kind of, you know,</p>
<p>there are these existential thoughts</p>
<p>that it brought about, like how ephemeral life is.</p>
<p>And I remember this Richard Dawkins quote,</p>
<p>he said something like,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re all gonna die and we&rsquo;re the lucky ones.</p>
<p>Yeah, that we even got a chance.</p>
<p>Or even, you mentioned Russian writers.</p>
<p>One of my favorite writers is Nabokov, Vladimir Nabokov.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ve read him,</p>
<p>but he said once that life is a chink of light</p>
<p>between two eternities of darkness.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re saying that&rsquo;s not terrifying to you?</p>
<p>Well, I prefer, I&rsquo;m happy with the prior,</p>
<p>the first eternity of darkness.</p>
<p>I prefer the second not to occur, but it&rsquo;s going to occur.</p>
<p>I mean, we know that Elon Musk aside,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m skeptical that we&rsquo;ll be colonizing other planets</p>
<p>in any substantive way.</p>
<p>And so our star, our sun will burn out.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s gonna take a few billion years or so,</p>
<p>but it will eventually,</p>
<p>the earth will become a cold lump of dirt</p>
<p>floating around in the universe with no life on it.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not just your light,</p>
<p>the light of your consciousness,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the light of our human civilization</p>
<p>that will eventually go out.</p>
<p>Yes, everything, at least here.</p>
<p>I do believe that there is life and intelligent life</p>
<p>in other parts of the universe on other planets.</p>
<p>I sometimes wonder if the second eternal darkness</p>
<p>is the thing that makes the light possible.</p>
<p>So in the other places out there,</p>
<p>I wonder how successfully can you truly be</p>
<p>without the deadline of death,</p>
<p>both at the human scale and at the civilizational scale.</p>
<p>I feel like we, in order to create anything beautiful,</p>
<p>we have to live on the edge of destruction.</p>
<p>That seems to be, some people would say</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just a feature of our past,</p>
<p>that our future can be otherwise.</p>
<p>But like you, I&rsquo;m somebody that looks at the data.</p>
<p>And currently the data says otherwise,</p>
<p>but of course we&rsquo;re constantly changing the data</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s change.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ll see.</p>
<p>I wonder what the future holds for us.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, as somebody who wrote a textbook</p>
<p>on evolutionary psychology,</p>
<p>what do you think is the meaning of the whole thing?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the meaning of life?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re very good at describing</p>
<p>how the human mind is the way it is,</p>
<p>but why is it here at all?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the purpose?</p>
<p>Well, I can give you my answer to that,</p>
<p>but I would actually love to hear your answer</p>
<p>because I know you&rsquo;ve asked this question</p>
<p>of dozens and dozens of people on your podcast.</p>
<p>And what are your thoughts on that?</p>
<p>Well, first of all, my mind changes on that a lot.</p>
<p>And I think the process of answering the question</p>
<p>is the fun thing, not the actual final answer.</p>
<p>I think the question itself is the most fun thing.</p>
<p>But for me, usually is two things.</p>
<p>One is love, and we can talk a long time.</p>
<p>What I mean by that is it&rsquo;s not just romantic love.</p>
<p>And two is to create, and hopefully to create beauty.</p>
<p>So, and again, I can talk forever what that means.</p>
<p>For me personally, creating beauty means engineering</p>
<p>and creating experiences, like connection with others.</p>
<p>On the love side, it&rsquo;s just the actual feeling,</p>
<p>the experience of deep appreciation</p>
<p>of everything around you,</p>
<p>like the sensory experiences of everything around you,</p>
<p>just feeling it every single moment,</p>
<p>saying, I&rsquo;m damn glad to be alive.</p>
<p>That light with the darkness on each side,</p>
<p>just being appreciative, like being in the experience</p>
<p>of truly present and experiencing it.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s not going to be there for long,</p>
<p>the whole thing ends.</p>
<p>And that to me is love.</p>
<p>And the reason romantic love is so important</p>
<p>is that other people are just awesome.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re fascinating black boxes</p>
<p>that can generate awesomeness.</p>
<p>So can like other animals and objects for me.</p>
<p>But humans in particular, for some reason,</p>
<p>are just generators of awesomeness.</p>
<p>They surprise us.</p>
<p>And therefore a good target of love.</p>
<p>Well, so that&rsquo;s a much more eloquent answer</p>
<p>than I could give, but I&rsquo;ll just say a thought or two</p>
<p>on that.</p>
<p>And I mean, one of the things,</p>
<p>what is the meaning of life?</p>
<p>I mean, in some sense,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re thinking about some eternal purpose,</p>
<p>meaning like if we look 5 billion years hence,</p>
<p>will any of this mean anything?</p>
<p>I think the answer to that is probably no.</p>
<p>Okay, but, and this is I think where my answer</p>
<p>would concur with yours,</p>
<p>is that I think we have a rich, evolved psychology</p>
<p>that contains many complex adaptations.</p>
<p>And at any one moment in time, most are quiescent.</p>
<p>Most are not activated.</p>
<p>But for me, part of the meaning of life</p>
<p>is experiencing the activation of a lot</p>
<p>of these complicated, evolved psychological mechanisms.</p>
<p>And they include romantic love.</p>
<p>They include friendship.</p>
<p>They include being part of a group or coalition,</p>
<p>because I think we&rsquo;re an intensely coalitional species.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s something about being a group member.</p>
<p>So just even, I don&rsquo;t know, if you&rsquo;re in sports,</p>
<p>if your team wins, you feel that somehow</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re a part of that.</p>
<p>But this goes for both the positive</p>
<p>and the darker sides of things.</p>
<p>So for example, warfare,</p>
<p>you see these men who have been through a war together,</p>
<p>and where their lives have depended on each other,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re like best friends for life,</p>
<p>and have a bond that is stronger than most people</p>
<p>form with a friend ever in their life,</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;ve been through these life or death experiences.</p>
<p>And so I wouldn&rsquo;t want to,</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t cause me to want to charge off and be in war,</p>
<p>but there are some types of adaptations,</p>
<p>even like warfare adaptations,</p>
<p>where in principle, I would like to experience them.</p>
<p>I would like to experience, and never will,</p>
<p>but what is it like to be in a coalition</p>
<p>where you are in combat with another coalition?</p>
<p>Not modern warfare, because it&rsquo;s horrible,</p>
<p>but where your life is in danger,</p>
<p>where your life, you depend for your life on other people,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re depending for their life on you,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s this kind of coalitional solidarity</p>
<p>that is unique.</p>
<p>Now, another thing that, of course,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll never be able to experience is murder,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m never going to murder anybody,</p>
<p>but studying homicidal ideation really gave me a,</p>
<p>it was an eye-opener.</p>
<p>It was as interesting as studying sexual fantasies,</p>
<p>because if you ask what triggers homicidal thoughts,</p>
<p>ideation, most people have had them.</p>
<p>Because I asked this question,</p>
<p>have you ever thought about killing someone?</p>
<p>And I get about 91% of men say yes,</p>
<p>and about 84% of women say no,</p>
<p>and even when I talk to people, they say, one-on-one,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll say, oh, no, I&rsquo;ve never thought of killing someone.</p>
<p>What kind of person do you think I am?</p>
<p>And then 10 minutes later, they&rsquo;ll say,</p>
<p>actually, there was this one time</p>
<p>when I got, this guy humiliated me in public,</p>
<p>and I, you know, and so,</p>
<p>but I think thoughts about killing, homicidal ideation,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re very predictable</p>
<p>from an evolutionary perspective,</p>
<p>if you, like we mentioned mate poachers earlier,</p>
<p>and infidelity, and there are other things,</p>
<p>but things like that, being humiliated in public,</p>
<p>status loss, you know, do trigger homicidal thoughts.</p>
<p>So anyway, I don&rsquo;t go off too much on that,</p>
<p>but I guess what I&rsquo;m saying in answer to your question</p>
<p>is experiencing the rich array of,</p>
<p>complex psychology that we have within us,</p>
<p>most of which remains unactivated,</p>
<p>and some of which will never be experienced.</p>
<p>Like, you know, there&rsquo;s some people</p>
<p>who will never experience love, for example,</p>
<p>because of, you know, cultural restrictions or whatever,</p>
<p>and so, to me, that&rsquo;s part of the meaning of life.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s so beautifully put,</p>
<p>the saying that they&rsquo;re kind of dormant,</p>
<p>inactivated aspects of the psychological mechanism.</p>
<p>So we have the capacity to experience a bunch of stuff.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like in video games,</p>
<p>you can unlock levels and so on.</p>
<p>And so this is basically,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s all of these things that are dormant in our mind</p>
<p>that we have the capacity to experience.</p>
<p>And part of the meaning is to try to experience</p>
<p>as many of them, or as many new ones,</p>
<p>novel for the particular society,</p>
<p>or maybe the entirety of human civilization, who knows?</p>
<p>Psychedelic drugs, like you said, violence,</p>
<p>experiences that might have to do</p>
<p>with brain-computer interfaces,</p>
<p>the interaction with all of those are experiences.</p>
<p>And so the question is, what is the ceiling?</p>
<p>What are, like, how infinite or nearly infinite</p>
<p>is the capacity of the human mind</p>
<p>to experience all those things?</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll get to discover those things.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m glad you never got a chance,</p>
<p>and never will get a chance to murder,</p>
<p>but I just want to put it on record that,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s definitely something on my bucket list.</p>
<p>Why do you think I dress like this?</p>
<p>Anyway, there is something appealing.</p>
<p>Like one of my favorite movies is Leon, the Professional.</p>
<p>Oh, I love that movie.</p>
<p>What is that?</p>
<p>Why is that so, listen, maybe it&rsquo;s the OCD thing.</p>
<p>Like killing other bad guys.</p>
<p>No women, no children.</p>
<p>Also loving that with Natalie Portman,</p>
<p>an incredible actress.</p>
<p>Also the complex, whatever that is,</p>
<p>the fatherly or romantic,</p>
<p>whatever that is, like Lolita type of thing.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what, I&rsquo;ve never read a PhD thesis</p>
<p>on that interpretation of that movie,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s a fascinating one.</p>
<p>Violence and love and sex,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what makes life worth living.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what makes it fun.</p>
<p>David, you&rsquo;re an incredible person,</p>
<p>incredible scientist.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a huge honor to share a city with you,</p>
<p>or I&rsquo;m the visitor.</p>
<p>You own this place, you run this place.</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t, we both live here now.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s been great talking to you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a great honor for me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve followed your podcast for a long, long time now,</p>
<p>and tremendously enjoy your interviews,</p>
<p>and you have a very inquisitive, inviting style</p>
<p>that brings out things in your guests,</p>
<p>which I think is fantastic.</p>
<p>Activates all those dormant psychological mechanisms.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what life, that&rsquo;s what conversation is all about.</p>
<p>Thank you for talking today.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation with David Buss.</p>
<p>To support this podcast,</p>
<p>please check out our sponsors in the description.</p>
<p>And now, let me leave you with some words from E.B. White.</p>
<p>If the world were merely seductive, that would be easy.</p>
<p>If it were merely challenging, that would be no problem.</p>
<p>But I rise in the morning torn</p>
<p>between a desire to improve the world</p>
<p>and a desire to enjoy the world.</p>
<p>This makes it hard to plan the day.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.</p>
