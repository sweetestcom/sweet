<p>today I hope you&rsquo;re having a wonderful day so far</p>
<p>my name is Bailey Sarian and today is Monday</p>
<p>which means it&rsquo;s Murder Mystery and Makeup Monday</p>
<p>shanasha shanasha</p>
<p>if you are new here hi welcome</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Bailey every Monday I sit down I talk about a true</p>
<p>crime case that&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>heavy on my noggin</p>
<p>and I do my makeup at the same</p>
<p>time it&rsquo;s a good time</p>
<p>if you like makeup and you are interested in true</p>
<p>crime I would</p>
<p>suggest you hit that subscribe button so I feel</p>
<p>like the last couple weeks have been really intense</p>
<p>right I just been talking</p>
<p>about some really</p>
<p>crazy stuff</p>
<p>going on today is</p>
<p>still bad people are</p>
<p>still dying</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not as bad as the other ones</p>
<p>okay so a lot of you who have been</p>
<p>watching probably know normally I</p>
<p>start off the</p>
<p>video talking</p>
<p>about the said to be killers</p>
<p>background and like</p>
<p>where they came from blah blah blah blah</p>
<p>right so today</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s just like so much to the</p>
<p>story I thought</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just gonna like jump into it and hopefully this</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t come out confusing</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna try my best</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying something different I</p>
<p>gotta learn</p>
<p>March 14th 1998</p>
<p>Los Angeles police receive a 9 one one call</p>
<p>about a body being found okay</p>
<p>oh she&rsquo;s jumping</p>
<p>right into it</p>
<p>now there was</p>
<p>a homeless person who was like out in an</p>
<p>alley digging through the dumpster looking for</p>
<p>food or something sad</p>
<p>and unfortunately</p>
<p>he came across</p>
<p>a body so the police department comes out</p>
<p>and they see a</p>
<p>white male he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>wrapped in a garbage bag</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s inside the dumpster there was no</p>
<p>identification on</p>
<p>his body so they had no idea who this guy was</p>
<p>he had no shoes on but</p>
<p>the bottom of his feet were clean</p>
<p>which indicated that</p>
<p>this was a body dump and the murder had</p>
<p>taken place</p>
<p>somewhere else</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what the police had determined police examined</p>
<p>the victim and they saw that it was a</p>
<p>close shot to</p>
<p>the back of his head that killed him there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>a gunshot in the back of his head they send the body</p>
<p>to the coroner&rsquo;s office for an autopsy</p>
<p>and while there they&rsquo;re able to ID the victim as</p>
<p>David Kasdan</p>
<p>so then police</p>
<p>go down to the</p>
<p>victims home</p>
<p>David kasdan&rsquo;s children</p>
<p>they had already been notified they were waiting</p>
<p>for the police at</p>
<p>david&rsquo;s house</p>
<p>David kasdan&rsquo;s</p>
<p>daughter had noticed that</p>
<p>their father&rsquo;s car</p>
<p>was missing from the garage</p>
<p>and they also noticed some damage that was</p>
<p>on this like</p>
<p>stone wall just outside the</p>
<p>driveway so investigators go and they</p>
<p>check it out and they see that there&rsquo;s like blue</p>
<p>paint on the wall it&rsquo;s the same</p>
<p>color of his</p>
<p>car so that is indicating that somebody left in a hurry</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>other evidence of foul play</p>
<p>so investigators had asked like</p>
<p>does your father have any enemies</p>
<p>anyone that</p>
<p>would want to hurt him and his children</p>
<p>who are grown</p>
<p>adults by the way but they are</p>
<p>quick to say hell yeah</p>
<p>65 year old</p>
<p>Santa chimes</p>
<p>oh and her 23 year old son</p>
<p>Kenny David</p>
<p>kasdan&rsquo;s kids presented the</p>
<p>police with a letter that that he had written to Sante</p>
<p>several days</p>
<p>prior now in this letter</p>
<p>he said that he didn&rsquo;t want to cooperate with the</p>
<p>crimes in a</p>
<p>particular loan</p>
<p>fraud scheme</p>
<p>now David kasdan&rsquo;s daughter</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t know the specifics of this scheme</p>
<p>but she recalls a strange</p>
<p>conversation she had with her father just days before</p>
<p>he had disappeared see his</p>
<p>daughter was over at his house</p>
<p>and there was this car and it was just like parked out</p>
<p>in front of her father&rsquo;s</p>
<p>house and her father</p>
<p>was super suspicious</p>
<p>of it and he</p>
<p>David Kasdan</p>
<p>he told his</p>
<p>daughter if you ever see that car</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t go outside I don&rsquo;t know why but like</p>
<p>David kasdan&rsquo;s daughter</p>
<p>like didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>push further for answers</p>
<p>she was just kind of like oh okay I</p>
<p>would have been asking</p>
<p>shit ton of questions we don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know who&rsquo;s that</p>
<p>should I go talk to them what</p>
<p>should I say okay so who is the Sante and</p>
<p>Kenny Kemes</p>
<p>that David caste&rsquo;s</p>
<p>daughter had mentioned</p>
<p>well David Kasdan</p>
<p>take a shot</p>
<p>every time I say it I</p>
<p>guess he had</p>
<p>known Santee and</p>
<p>Kenny Chimes</p>
<p>and their family for many</p>
<p>many years David</p>
<p>had been friends with millionaire</p>
<p>Ken Chimes senior</p>
<p>Since 1974 then</p>
<p>David had worked on an insurance</p>
<p>claim for the family when Ken Chimes</p>
<p>Senior passed away</p>
<p>David had been</p>
<p>threatened by</p>
<p>Santee and Kenny recently</p>
<p>the threats were coming in via</p>
<p>telephone personal appearances</p>
<p>and letters</p>
<p>saying that</p>
<p>David needed to</p>
<p>watch out and go</p>
<p>along with their plans or else</p>
<p>anyway so detectives</p>
<p>check into the</p>
<p>background of</p>
<p>sant&rsquo;e Chimes and her son</p>
<p>Kenny Jr and they</p>
<p>soon find out that one of them has a pretty lengthy</p>
<p>rap sheet miss</p>
<p>Sante over here had been</p>
<p>quite busy sante</p>
<p>had served time for involuntary servitude or</p>
<p>slavery this being the most</p>
<p>recent case</p>
<p>she had also been incarcerated for theft</p>
<p>and fraud she had a pattern of luring</p>
<p>Mexican and</p>
<p>Latin American</p>
<p>immigrants to come work for her as a maid</p>
<p>with promises</p>
<p>of good treatment</p>
<p>travels and a job</p>
<p>but for the most part she just</p>
<p>completely lied to</p>
<p>these people</p>
<p>about everything though when Sante</p>
<p>walked into a room she got attention from everybody</p>
<p>men and women</p>
<p>okay and I&rsquo;ll tell you why</p>
<p>because she had a resemblance</p>
<p>spot on resemblance</p>
<p>to Elizabeth</p>
<p>Taylor and she played that up</p>
<p>friends would say</p>
<p>that Santee</p>
<p>would say that she yeah she was Elizabeth</p>
<p>Taylor cause like people</p>
<p>would recognize her and</p>
<p>think she was Elizabeth</p>
<p>Taylor santee</p>
<p>would just play that up and be like Yes</p>
<p>I am Elizabeth</p>
<p>Taylor darling</p>
<p>or whatever she</p>
<p>would do and she</p>
<p>would just give free shit</p>
<p>but Santee also had charisma to go with the looks</p>
<p>which she felt like gave her</p>
<p>power over men</p>
<p>so police were surprised</p>
<p>by her history</p>
<p>but the slavery charges</p>
<p>is what concern them the most because of her violent</p>
<p>treatment towards her mates</p>
<p>okay Santee</p>
<p>had mates at one point</p>
<p>she would make them</p>
<p>clean already</p>
<p>clean floors</p>
<p>they were not allowed to</p>
<p>leave or talk to anybody she</p>
<p>would like walk them into the</p>
<p>house they just</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t allowed to do anything without her permission</p>
<p>on several occasions</p>
<p>she actually beat the crap out of some of</p>
<p>her maids as well</p>
<p>like one of her maids</p>
<p>clean something</p>
<p>wrong or like she just didn&rsquo;t listen to her santee</p>
<p>took the iron</p>
<p>and burned her with it another maid said that</p>
<p>she had beat her with</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not laughing</p>
<p>coat hangers</p>
<p>when she didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>clean correctly</p>
<p>I was kind of giggling because I was</p>
<p>thinking of</p>
<p>Mommy Dearest</p>
<p>no more wired hangers</p>
<p>you know that</p>
<p>right let&rsquo;s hope</p>
<p>a lot of you guys are</p>
<p>kinda young</p>
<p>watching this</p>
<p>mommy dearest</p>
<p>look it up on top of all that the maids</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t even receive pay for their work</p>
<p>and because they were illegal immigrants</p>
<p>santee completely took advantage of them</p>
<p>so then in 1970</p>
<p>Santee meets</p>
<p>real estate millionaire Ken</p>
<p>Chimes you see</p>
<p>Santee was reading a local</p>
<p>magazine and she came across this article</p>
<p>about Ken Chimes</p>
<p>and like how rich he was</p>
<p>how he recently went through a divorce</p>
<p>so then Santee</p>
<p>does her homework okay she does her homework on Ken</p>
<p>she finds out</p>
<p>that he&rsquo;s worth</p>
<p>millions of dollars</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s recently divorced</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s thinking</p>
<p>oh yeah baby</p>
<p>jackpot she was determined to make Ken</p>
<p>hers I mean she was just</p>
<p>ready to live</p>
<p>the life of a wealthy</p>
<p>millionaire because she thought she deserved that</p>
<p>so Santee did more homework on Ken</p>
<p>and she realized well she</p>
<p>found out what he liked</p>
<p>and tailored herself to fit that image</p>
<p>for example</p>
<p>ken&rsquo;s favorite</p>
<p>color was white</p>
<p>exciting so then Santee</p>
<p>decided to wear</p>
<p>white all the time</p>
<p>Ken love the</p>
<p>smell of gardenias</p>
<p>so that became her signature perfume</p>
<p>she wasn&rsquo;t wealthy at this</p>
<p>point like Ken</p>
<p>so she made</p>
<p>sure to dress in a way that exuded</p>
<p>wealth status</p>
<p>highbrow money</p>
<p>and it was all</p>
<p>just designed to help get what she wanted</p>
<p>santee was constantly</p>
<p>throwing herself at him</p>
<p>and eventually it</p>
<p>stuck took some time</p>
<p>but it worked</p>
<p>the 2 began</p>
<p>to hang out and to date and they had fun together</p>
<p>Sante had provided some</p>
<p>excitement to his life it was</p>
<p>kind of boring and bleak and it wasn&rsquo;t long before Ken</p>
<p>SR becomes aware of</p>
<p>sant&rsquo;s criminal behavior</p>
<p>and he allowed her to</p>
<p>carry on with her maids</p>
<p>see when she</p>
<p>moved in with Ken</p>
<p>this millionaire that&rsquo;s when she really</p>
<p>started to to get</p>
<p>these maids because they</p>
<p>could afford it</p>
<p>now it&rsquo;s said that Ken</p>
<p>it said that he was seduced into the situation</p>
<p>sante was the boss</p>
<p>she called the shots Ken just went</p>
<p>along with it he had nothing to do with</p>
<p>these maids but I mean come on</p>
<p>so then 5 years</p>
<p>later Santee</p>
<p>gives birth to</p>
<p>Kenny Junior in 1975</p>
<p>so this is the son</p>
<p>of Ken Chimes</p>
<p>SR the millionaire</p>
<p>right Kenny was</p>
<p>treated as the prince of the</p>
<p>households you</p>
<p>could do no</p>
<p>wrong this baby was</p>
<p>everything to her</p>
<p>I personally</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s because this baby</p>
<p>was guaranteed</p>
<p>money for Santee</p>
<p>being the son of a very wealthy man</p>
<p>Ken chimes the millionaire</p>
<p>he told friends</p>
<p>and even Santee that he didn&rsquo;t want to marry her</p>
<p>he knew that she was</p>
<p>after his money</p>
<p>and all of his</p>
<p>money was going to his children from the previous</p>
<p>marriage so</p>
<p>Santee was like well</p>
<p>shit I will just like get pregnant and trap his ass</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s my assumption</p>
<p>a few years</p>
<p>later the Chimes</p>
<p>family they</p>
<p>moved to Las Vegas</p>
<p>I mean right off the bat</p>
<p>Santee is transforming</p>
<p>Kenny her baby</p>
<p>into her accomplice</p>
<p>santee would take him</p>
<p>shopping with her in a</p>
<p>stroller you know she</p>
<p>would have her baby in the stroller</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>funny it&rsquo;s really sad that she was</p>
<p>using her baby to</p>
<p>help her but her kid is just sitting in the</p>
<p>stroller like</p>
<p>excited to be</p>
<p>alive she would</p>
<p>stuff items into the</p>
<p>stroller she would even</p>
<p>stuff items</p>
<p>underneath the baby to like hide them and</p>
<p>steal it she controlled</p>
<p>who he could see</p>
<p>when they can see them</p>
<p>Kenny was also tutored at home</p>
<p>santee didn&rsquo;t want him to have</p>
<p>any friends or contact with people without her approval</p>
<p>Kenny did get a chance to</p>
<p>break away from his</p>
<p>mother&rsquo;s tight</p>
<p>grip when Santee</p>
<p>finally received jail time</p>
<p>for slavery</p>
<p>apparently one of the maids</p>
<p>had escaped</p>
<p>out of the house</p>
<p>and called 9 one</p>
<p>one it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>funny but like just the</p>
<p>whole thing is like</p>
<p>crazy like what is happening</p>
<p>but luckily one of the mates</p>
<p>escapes and calls 9 one one and gets out of that</p>
<p>abuse Kenny</p>
<p>would say he saw the detectives come and arrest his</p>
<p>mother and said it was just</p>
<p>devastating for him</p>
<p>but Santee was</p>
<p>taken away to go to prison</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s when</p>
<p>Kenny actually</p>
<p>had a shot to live a normal life away from his mom</p>
<p>so Santee only got a 5 year prison</p>
<p>sentence and they determined that her boyfriend Ken</p>
<p>senior he wasn&rsquo;t involved in any way</p>
<p>so she goes away</p>
<p>and then while she&rsquo;s away</p>
<p>Kenny and his father they actually like grew really</p>
<p>close together</p>
<p>Ken senior he decided to</p>
<p>like he retired so he was home to really take care of</p>
<p>Kenny and he enrolled</p>
<p>him into a private</p>
<p>elite Catholic</p>
<p>school in Las Vegas and</p>
<p>Kenny was able to like go to</p>
<p>school and make friends and just be</p>
<p>quote unquote normal</p>
<p>even though he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to an</p>
<p>elite private</p>
<p>school but yeah normal</p>
<p>kenny&rsquo;s father also</p>
<p>admitted like that he</p>
<p>spoiled Kenny during this time</p>
<p>and he was trying to like buy his love</p>
<p>but that didn&rsquo;t last long</p>
<p>santee was released from prison</p>
<p>in December of 1989</p>
<p>and she had only served</p>
<p>3 years of the 5 years that she was sentenced</p>
<p>and the old patterns of control</p>
<p>emerge again</p>
<p>so in the fall of 1993</p>
<p>Kenny enrolls into college</p>
<p>he seems to be</p>
<p>doing well kind of like away from his</p>
<p>mother but then in 1993</p>
<p>Ken SR dies</p>
<p>suddenly from an aneurysm</p>
<p>now when this happened</p>
<p>Santee was really</p>
<p>worried because she</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t have her name on anything not one deed not one</p>
<p>checkbook or even a credit card here&rsquo;s his wife of a</p>
<p>multi millionaire</p>
<p>who has no access to any of the</p>
<p>money or his</p>
<p>money whatsoever</p>
<p>Ken sr&rsquo;s will</p>
<p>it was said that</p>
<p>everything was to go to his children</p>
<p>from his previous marriage</p>
<p>but did not include</p>
<p>Kenny Jr or</p>
<p>Santee at all</p>
<p>fucked up I think</p>
<p>maybe he just forgot to update it but so Sante</p>
<p>she like calls</p>
<p>Kenny her son who&rsquo;s at college now</p>
<p>and she just is telling him how</p>
<p>worried she is she</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t have any</p>
<p>money what is she</p>
<p>gonna do and</p>
<p>really just dumps all of</p>
<p>her stress onto him</p>
<p>so then Kenny</p>
<p>he ends up just</p>
<p>dropping out of college</p>
<p>and he returns home to live with Santee</p>
<p>help take care of her</p>
<p>so Kenny begins taking part in more of his mother&rsquo;s</p>
<p>schemes as she</p>
<p>tries to liquidate the</p>
<p>assets of her now past</p>
<p>lovers estate</p>
<p>so back to Los Angeles investigators are</p>
<p>suspicious Sante</p>
<p>and Kenny chimes</p>
<p>but they need to find a motive</p>
<p>cause remember the</p>
<p>death we talked</p>
<p>about in the beginning they</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s Sante and</p>
<p>Kenny chimes right</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m wondering if how I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>setting this up is confusing we&rsquo;re already here police</p>
<p>piece together</p>
<p>the details of</p>
<p>the loan fraud</p>
<p>scheme santee</p>
<p>took a $280,000 loan out on her house</p>
<p>in David castin&rsquo;s name</p>
<p>David received a loan book in the mail from this bank</p>
<p>saying that he now</p>
<p>owed a certain amount of</p>
<p>money every</p>
<p>month for a loan that he had</p>
<p>taken out on</p>
<p>that house so</p>
<p>when David got this in the mail he&rsquo;s like what the fuck</p>
<p>David tells the bank that the mortgage is not his</p>
<p>and then the bank</p>
<p>freezes the account police discover the</p>
<p>money had been</p>
<p>transferred to an account belonging to Santee</p>
<p>so then Santee</p>
<p>somehow figures out that somebody has cotton on to her</p>
<p>she calls and threatens</p>
<p>David Castin</p>
<p>to go along with the loan</p>
<p>fraud or else</p>
<p>so police at this</p>
<p>point now are like okay we have a motive for</p>
<p>David castin&rsquo;s murder</p>
<p>so they go out to the Las Vegas</p>
<p>house the one that the loan</p>
<p>was taken out</p>
<p>and they find it is the subject of an</p>
<p>arson investigation</p>
<p>you see the</p>
<p>house it was set on fire</p>
<p>and burned down</p>
<p>santee and Kenny at that</p>
<p>point were long gone and had</p>
<p>moved somewhere new</p>
<p>so police went</p>
<p>to interview the notary public that had forged</p>
<p>David caston&rsquo;s name</p>
<p>on the loan documents</p>
<p>now this person had been told by</p>
<p>Santee that</p>
<p>she had the</p>
<p>power of attorney to sign</p>
<p>David kasdan&rsquo;s name to the loan documents</p>
<p>which in fact</p>
<p>was not true this person also goes on to tell them that</p>
<p>she notarized a new deed for the same</p>
<p>house with the name</p>
<p>Robert Mccarran</p>
<p>so police go looking for this</p>
<p>Robert guy and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>having a really hard time finding him they believe that</p>
<p>Robert was a possible</p>
<p>victim of kidnapping</p>
<p>so police find this 911 call that</p>
<p>Robert had made</p>
<p>after escaping from</p>
<p>Santee and kenny&rsquo;s home</p>
<p>remember how I said that the one of the maids had</p>
<p>escaped from the</p>
<p>house and called 911</p>
<p>well that was Robert</p>
<p>they were able to locate</p>
<p>Robert Mccarran</p>
<p>at a homeless shelter so</p>
<p>Robert tells investigators that</p>
<p>Santee hired him as a</p>
<p>houseman what do you call a man made</p>
<p>made so Robert tells investigators Santee</p>
<p>also hired a man</p>
<p>named Sean to be the family chauffeur</p>
<p>Sean was told by</p>
<p>Santee to watch</p>
<p>Robert the house elf</p>
<p>and to keep control of him and was told to assault</p>
<p>Robert when he wasn&rsquo;t doing what</p>
<p>Santee instructed him to do</p>
<p>this chauffeur guy was</p>
<p>in charge of</p>
<p>Robert and making</p>
<p>sure that he was like following the rules and like</p>
<p>would beat him and</p>
<p>stuff forge hold on detectives then</p>
<p>look for this guy Sean the chauffeur</p>
<p>Sean he admits he sold</p>
<p>Kenny a 22 caliber handgun</p>
<p>and the 22 caliber that</p>
<p>Kenny had purchased matt from</p>
<p>David castin&rsquo;s body so he agrees to let police know</p>
<p>if he hears from</p>
<p>Santee and Kenny again</p>
<p>but other than</p>
<p>that he really had nothing else for them police soon</p>
<p>learned through questioning witnesses</p>
<p>that the 2 were now in Florida</p>
<p>they had made</p>
<p>their way all the way to Florida</p>
<p>they ended up in Florida</p>
<p>because Santee and</p>
<p>Kenny were making</p>
<p>their way to the Bahamas</p>
<p>where Ken SR</p>
<p>his money was</p>
<p>apparently he had an offshore</p>
<p>count in the Bahamas</p>
<p>where he stored a lot of</p>
<p>money and Santee</p>
<p>wanted her hands on that</p>
<p>but before LA police</p>
<p>could get out to Florida</p>
<p>Santee and Kenny</p>
<p>are on the move</p>
<p>again they both realized that there are much bigger</p>
<p>targets in New York City</p>
<p>and there is a lot more</p>
<p>money over there</p>
<p>for example</p>
<p>Irene Silverman</p>
<p>who was 82 years old Irene was a New York socialite</p>
<p>santee and Kenny</p>
<p>found out that Irene</p>
<p>Silverman had a</p>
<p>multi million dollar mansion</p>
<p>on the Upper East Side</p>
<p>she had rented out</p>
<p>rooms partly for</p>
<p>money and partly for company so Irene</p>
<p>her extremely</p>
<p>wealthy husband had passed away</p>
<p>and again it was like put in a magazine</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s how Lexante</p>
<p>found out we</p>
<p>gotta stop doing that</p>
<p>she found out that the Cyrene lady</p>
<p>she had took on</p>
<p>all of her husband&rsquo;s wealth</p>
<p>she was just loading and then</p>
<p>on June 14th 1998</p>
<p>Santee and Kenny</p>
<p>they arrive in New York</p>
<p>Kenny goes straight to the townhouse</p>
<p>and he shows up there with a</p>
<p>reference and 6 000</p>
<p>cash for the first</p>
<p>month&rsquo;s rent Irene</p>
<p>she did ask</p>
<p>Kenny for an ID and to get a credit application</p>
<p>but Kenny kept reassuring her that he was</p>
<p>gonna get it to her ASAP</p>
<p>tomorrow yeah I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna get that to you</p>
<p>so Kenny then moves into the</p>
<p>apartment 1B</p>
<p>He does this</p>
<p>under the name Manny</p>
<p>Guerin a few days</p>
<p>later eva his assistant</p>
<p>moves in as well</p>
<p>and this Eva assistant</p>
<p>was actually his mom</p>
<p>Santee they wanted</p>
<p>to get rid of Irene</p>
<p>steal her identity</p>
<p>and then be able to take over irene&rsquo;s finances so they</p>
<p>could be rich</p>
<p>wealthy and just</p>
<p>live their life that was the plan but Irene</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s suspicious</p>
<p>you see she goes back and she asks</p>
<p>Kenny aka Manny</p>
<p>can you complete this credit application</p>
<p>and every time she asks he says like oh yeah I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna get you tomorrow</p>
<p>and then Irene</p>
<p>also notices</p>
<p>that whenever</p>
<p>kenny&rsquo;s like walking in the hallway or leaving his</p>
<p>apartment he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>avoiding the security cameras</p>
<p>he was always trying to stay</p>
<p>close to the walls and he</p>
<p>avoided showing his face on the cameras too</p>
<p>Irene then like confides and friends</p>
<p>about the strange new tenants in One B</p>
<p>Then she decides</p>
<p>to evict them</p>
<p>on July 5th</p>
<p>so then back in Los Angeles Stan</p>
<p>so he contacts police</p>
<p>says that he received a call from Santee</p>
<p>in New York and that she wanted him to come out there</p>
<p>so he could manage</p>
<p>an apartment</p>
<p>building that she was getting</p>
<p>santee suggested that he brings</p>
<p>his toys she meant</p>
<p>to bring his</p>
<p>collection of guns</p>
<p>so police decide to use Stan</p>
<p>okay and they arrange a sting operation</p>
<p>for Stan to fly to New York</p>
<p>meet with Santee and</p>
<p>Kenny at which</p>
<p>point police were</p>
<p>gonna grab the 2 and take them into custody</p>
<p>once New York police</p>
<p>have them in custody</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna fly them back to LA</p>
<p>for questioning those</p>
<p>dan plans to meet</p>
<p>Kenny and Sante at a hotel</p>
<p>so New York</p>
<p>police set up surveillance at the</p>
<p>hotel around</p>
<p>5 p m Sante and</p>
<p>Kenny show up police they waited for the perfect moment</p>
<p>and then they</p>
<p>moved in for</p>
<p>their arrest</p>
<p>now at that same time across town</p>
<p>the New York police are called to the</p>
<p>house of Irene</p>
<p>Silverman now Irene</p>
<p>was missing</p>
<p>Irene hadn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>taken a step outside of her Manhattan</p>
<p>townhouse by herself in 15 years</p>
<p>so when she was missing that day it raised</p>
<p>alarms immediately</p>
<p>her rental agent called the police that day</p>
<p>and the workers</p>
<p>quickly suggested</p>
<p>to police that they look into the tenant of One Bee</p>
<p>detectives want to talk to this mysterious</p>
<p>Manny Garen</p>
<p>but they are</p>
<p>completely unaware</p>
<p>that the Manny guy was really</p>
<p>Kenny who just got arrested across town</p>
<p>so the next day</p>
<p>Irene silverman&rsquo;s disappearance</p>
<p>hits the papers</p>
<p>and eyewitnesses are able to give the police</p>
<p>a description</p>
<p>of the tenant</p>
<p>that was living in 1B</p>
<p>and then a sketch is made up</p>
<p>they release the</p>
<p>sketch of Manny</p>
<p>and they put it out there</p>
<p>one of the federal</p>
<p>agents who had arrested</p>
<p>Kenny and Santee</p>
<p>he realized the</p>
<p>sketch of this Manny guy looks exactly like that guy</p>
<p>Kenny look just like him this</p>
<p>point New York police question Santee and</p>
<p>Kenny they deny</p>
<p>any knowledge</p>
<p>of Irene Silverman</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know her</p>
<p>never live there who</p>
<p>so the next day police they locate</p>
<p>Santee and kenny&rsquo;s car and</p>
<p>inside where they find a 45</p>
<p>caliber gun</p>
<p>there was a</p>
<p>large black</p>
<p>nylon bag found</p>
<p>in the trunk</p>
<p>they also find a date rate drug a stun gun</p>
<p>a 9mm Glock</p>
<p>22 000 in cash</p>
<p>forged social</p>
<p>security cards</p>
<p>and a forged document giving them</p>
<p>power of attorney in Irene</p>
<p>silverman&rsquo;s name</p>
<p>a lot of forging</p>
<p>going on they also</p>
<p>found a set of 13 spiral notebooks</p>
<p>santee kept</p>
<p>the spiral notebooks and had pages and pages of notes</p>
<p>one entry said</p>
<p>quote get social security number</p>
<p>elderly people</p>
<p>easy targets</p>
<p>end quote the</p>
<p>notebooks also contained information relating to the</p>
<p>David Kasdan murder</p>
<p>the most significant pages in</p>
<p>sante&rsquo;s notebook were the entries that stated</p>
<p>kill D K Who</p>
<p>could DK be</p>
<p>David Kasdan</p>
<p>a few weeks later</p>
<p>LAPD detectives</p>
<p>arrive in New York hoping to get a confession</p>
<p>for the murder of Mr Kasdan</p>
<p>but their case is weak</p>
<p>they have a motive</p>
<p>but no witnesses</p>
<p>and no weapon</p>
<p>David Kasdan was shot with a 22</p>
<p>caliber handgun</p>
<p>but none of the guns</p>
<p>found in their car</p>
<p>matched the murder weapon</p>
<p>so police then locate</p>
<p>Shawn talk to him</p>
<p>again because his name was mentioned</p>
<p>again and again in</p>
<p>sant&rsquo;s notebooks</p>
<p>Shawn then goes on to say that</p>
<p>early one morning</p>
<p>Kenny came and picked</p>
<p>Shawn up they</p>
<p>drove out to</p>
<p>David kasdan&rsquo;s house</p>
<p>Shawn didn&rsquo;t know who</p>
<p>David Kasdan was</p>
<p>but Kenny told</p>
<p>Shawn just to like wait outside</p>
<p>so like Shawn is just waiting there</p>
<p>and he hears a pop like a loud</p>
<p>pop like a gunshot</p>
<p>Kenny comes outside and tells</p>
<p>Shawn to come into the</p>
<p>house and when</p>
<p>Shawn walks into the</p>
<p>house he sees</p>
<p>David Kasdan</p>
<p>lying on the</p>
<p>kitchen floor</p>
<p>Kenny told Shawn to</p>
<p>go out to the</p>
<p>driveway and to back in</p>
<p>David kasdan&rsquo;s car into the garage</p>
<p>and they could load</p>
<p>david&rsquo;s body into the</p>
<p>trunk Kenny</p>
<p>loads the body and they put him in the back of</p>
<p>David casson&rsquo;s own vehicle</p>
<p>and then look</p>
<p>Kenny and Sean</p>
<p>leave david&rsquo;s body</p>
<p>and car near the airport</p>
<p>they throw the gun</p>
<p>down the sewer</p>
<p>and then they make</p>
<p>one last stop he</p>
<p>drove to a floral</p>
<p>shop on the way home and they purchased a bouquet</p>
<p>of flowers for</p>
<p>kenny&rsquo;s mom</p>
<p>so now police investigators have this new information</p>
<p>the detectives they</p>
<p>drive back to</p>
<p>david&rsquo;s home</p>
<p>and they conduct</p>
<p>a luminol test</p>
<p>so they do this</p>
<p>luminal test</p>
<p>and they see that there was evidence of</p>
<p>blood in the kitchen</p>
<p>proving that</p>
<p>shawn&rsquo;s story has credibility</p>
<p>awesome so finally</p>
<p>the LA prosecutors</p>
<p>have a case</p>
<p>with Shawn as</p>
<p>their star witness</p>
<p>so on December 16th 1998</p>
<p>Santee and Kenny</p>
<p>are in New York and they are facing 84</p>
<p>separate charges</p>
<p>including the</p>
<p>second degree murder</p>
<p>of Irene Silverman</p>
<p>the New York murder case was</p>
<p>kind of rough there was no body</p>
<p>there was no confession</p>
<p>and there was no DNA</p>
<p>and both had pled not guilty</p>
<p>it was all circumstantial evidence they did have</p>
<p>125 witnesses</p>
<p>but they knew without a body</p>
<p>it was gonna be hard to prove</p>
<p>and finally on May 18th of 2000</p>
<p>Santee and Kenny were</p>
<p>found guilty</p>
<p>on all counts</p>
<p>how they did it I don&rsquo;t know but they did I</p>
<p>think it was the</p>
<p>125 witnesses</p>
<p>that really sealed the deal together</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re sentenced</p>
<p>to nearly 250 years in prison and Santee</p>
<p>she launched this</p>
<p>media campaign to try to convince the</p>
<p>press that she was innocent she</p>
<p>claimed that the evidence was</p>
<p>planted and that the police had framed her</p>
<p>now you can</p>
<p>watch clips of her</p>
<p>having these meltdowns I didn&rsquo;t do it</p>
<p>how could the police do this to me</p>
<p>I feel bad for the American</p>
<p>people like she was</p>
<p>you kind of want to believe her you&rsquo;re like yeah lady</p>
<p>yeah she&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>great actress</p>
<p>she should have been an actress</p>
<p>back in California</p>
<p>officials announced plans</p>
<p>to have the both of them</p>
<p>to stand trial for the murder of</p>
<p>David Kasdan</p>
<p>so in the meantime before that in</p>
<p>October of 2000</p>
<p>Kenny was doing an interview</p>
<p>with Court TV</p>
<p>now in this interview</p>
<p>Kenny had just snapped</p>
<p>he rushed the reporter he held her hostage</p>
<p>Kenny was able to grab all</p>
<p>point pen and</p>
<p>press it to her</p>
<p>throat he demanded that his mother</p>
<p>not be sent to California</p>
<p>where the 2 were</p>
<p>going to face the</p>
<p>death penalty</p>
<p>so he&rsquo;s holding this lady hostage for 4 hours</p>
<p>4 hours of negotiation</p>
<p>Kenny finally removed the pen</p>
<p>from the reporter&rsquo;s</p>
<p>throat negotiators had created some kind of distraction</p>
<p>and wrestle</p>
<p>Kenny to the ground I mean he was already</p>
<p>found guilty he probably was like fuck it</p>
<p>finally in 2004 the</p>
<p>trial begins for the murder of</p>
<p>David Kasdan and</p>
<p>suddenly prosecutors are</p>
<p>blindsided because</p>
<p>their star witness</p>
<p>Sean remember the one who was like yeah I was there</p>
<p>he disappears he just vanishes</p>
<p>Sean was their main witness people are just panicking</p>
<p>but luckily luckily</p>
<p>a few days later</p>
<p>Kenny decides to talk</p>
<p>Kenny agrees to testify</p>
<p>against his</p>
<p>mother only if neither of them will receive the</p>
<p>death penalty</p>
<p>so over the course of</p>
<p>3 days Kenny confesses to the murders</p>
<p>and tells detectives that</p>
<p>David was going to report them</p>
<p>and Santee wanted him dead</p>
<p>he described in detail how he and his</p>
<p>mother Santee</p>
<p>had lied and stayed in the</p>
<p>building owned by Irene</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re like oh shit finally we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to hear what happened to Irene</p>
<p>would stay in his</p>
<p>apartment one being</p>
<p>right and they</p>
<p>could see everything that was</p>
<p>going on from like the little peephole</p>
<p>on their door</p>
<p>and they were waiting</p>
<p>for the perfect time to attack Irene</p>
<p>so they were just</p>
<p>watching her through the peephole</p>
<p>they see Irene</p>
<p>walking down the hallway</p>
<p>alone they&rsquo;re like this is the perfect time</p>
<p>Kenny open the door</p>
<p>santee used a</p>
<p>stun gun on</p>
<p>poor Irene and</p>
<p>Kenny with his bare hands</p>
<p>strangled Irene to</p>
<p>death he and Santee</p>
<p>then placed her in a</p>
<p>large duffel bag then put</p>
<p>her in their</p>
<p>vehicle and</p>
<p>transported her several</p>
<p>miles away dumped her body</p>
<p>in a dumpster</p>
<p>behind a gas station</p>
<p>Kenny testifies</p>
<p>against his</p>
<p>mother he pleads</p>
<p>guilty and is sentenced to life</p>
<p>santee she represents herself and pleads not guilty</p>
<p>she stood by that she</p>
<p>claimed that the cops</p>
<p>threatened her son with the</p>
<p>death penalty and forced him to make a</p>
<p>false confession</p>
<p>and that her</p>
<p>trial was just like the</p>
<p>Salem witch</p>
<p>trials and she</p>
<p>claimed that the prosecutors</p>
<p>were guilty for</p>
<p>murdering the Constitution I&rsquo;m serious</p>
<p>you guys see her theatrics</p>
<p>murdering the Constitution of the American people</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s very dramatic the judge then</p>
<p>ordered Sante</p>
<p>not to speak</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>done talking he also tells her she&rsquo;s not allowed to</p>
<p>speak to the</p>
<p>media because she was calling the</p>
<p>media people all the goddamn time</p>
<p>the judge felt that</p>
<p>Santee was attempting to</p>
<p>influence the jury</p>
<p>as they may have seen or</p>
<p>heard interviews she was giving out</p>
<p>smart anyways in the end</p>
<p>Sante is convicted of</p>
<p>first degree murder</p>
<p>in the case of</p>
<p>David Casdin</p>
<p>on July 7th of 2004</p>
<p>she was sentenced to life in prison</p>
<p>at the correctional facility in New York</p>
<p>this day they</p>
<p>still have not</p>
<p>found irene&rsquo;s body</p>
<p>which is awful</p>
<p>and Kenny like also sentenced to life in prison</p>
<p>and is currently</p>
<p>incarcerated</p>
<p>at a correctional facility</p>
<p>in California santee</p>
<p>she ended up</p>
<p>dying of natural</p>
<p>causes in May of 2014</p>
<p>some believe that Kenny</p>
<p>should have gotten a</p>
<p>lighter sentence</p>
<p>they think that his life</p>
<p>would have followed</p>
<p>a different path it hadn&rsquo;t been for his</p>
<p>mother her controlling ways</p>
<p>only did these</p>
<p>things because his mother</p>
<p>brainwashed him and convinced him to go</p>
<p>along with her</p>
<p>crimes tati had</p>
<p>never confessed</p>
<p>to any of the</p>
<p>crimes even to the day she died</p>
<p>which is like lady just give it up at that</p>
<p>point just give it up</p>
<p>naturally Hollywood</p>
<p>was like yes we need to make this into a movie</p>
<p>2001 a made for TV</p>
<p>movie called like</p>
<p>Mother Like Son</p>
<p>it starred married</p>
<p>Tyler Moore as Santee</p>
<p>that was pretty</p>
<p>successful movie</p>
<p>and then another</p>
<p>movie in 2006</p>
<p>about the case</p>
<p>it was called A Little</p>
<p>Thing Called Murder</p>
<p>and that was a Lifetime</p>
<p>movie so you know that was cheesy</p>
<p>and good and then in 2009 they even had their own</p>
<p>feature on Dateline</p>
<p>so that is the</p>
<p>story of Santee and</p>
<p>Kenny Chimes</p>
<p>they called them the</p>
<p>mother daughter Bonnie and Clyde</p>
<p>I hope that wasn&rsquo;t too confusing</p>
<p>it seems like</p>
<p>Santee she just wanted to be rich</p>
<p>and she went</p>
<p>after that goal</p>
<p>in her life and I just want to let you guys know that</p>
<p>you know you just need to set better goals for yourself</p>
<p>like if you want to be rich that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>great that&rsquo;s awesome</p>
<p>but maybe like</p>
<p>earn it not kill people for it and</p>
<p>steal their money</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s my advice for you let me know what you guys</p>
<p>think of this case do you</p>
<p>think Kenny</p>
<p>should get an easier sentence</p>
<p>but other than that</p>
<p>I hope you have a wonderful day</p>
<p>today you make good choices</p>
<p>and I will see you guys later bye</p>
