    <p>Where are the darkest places you&rsquo;ve ever gone in your life?</p>
<p>The following is a conversation with Karl Deisseroth,</p>
<p>professor of bioengineering, psychiatry,</p>
<p>and behavioral sciences at Stanford University.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s one of the greatest living psychiatrists</p>
<p>and neuroscientists in the world.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s also just a fascinating human being.</p>
<p>We discuss both the darkest and the most beautiful places</p>
<p>that the human mind can take us.</p>
<p>He explores this in his book called</p>
<p>Projections, A Story of Human Emotions.</p>
<p>I highly recommend it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s written masterfully.</p>
<p>This is the Lex Friedman podcast.</p>
<p>To support it, please check out our sponsors</p>
<p>in the description.</p>
<p>And now, dear friends, here&rsquo;s Karl Deisseroth.</p>
<p>You open your book called Projections,</p>
<p>A Story of Human Emotions with a few beautiful words</p>
<p>to summarize all of humanity.</p>
<p>The book draws insights about the human mind</p>
<p>from modern psychiatry and neuroscience.</p>
<p>So if it&rsquo;s okay, let me read a few sentences</p>
<p>from the opening.</p>
<p>You gotta give props to beautiful writing when I see it.</p>
<p>Quote, in the art of weaving, warp threads are structural</p>
<p>and strong and anchored at the origin,</p>
<p>creating a frame for crossing fibers</p>
<p>as the fabric is woven.</p>
<p>Projecting across the advancing edge into free space,</p>
<p>warp threads bridge the formed past</p>
<p>to the ragged present to the yet featureless future.</p>
<p>Yet featureless future, well done, well done, sir.</p>
<p>The tapestry of the human story has its own warp threads,</p>
<p>rooted deep in the gorges of East Africa,</p>
<p>connecting the shifting textures of human life</p>
<p>over millions of years, spanning pictographs</p>
<p>backdroped by crevice ice, by angulated forestry,</p>
<p>by stone and steel, and by glowing rare earths.</p>
<p>The inner workings of the mind give form to these threads,</p>
<p>creating a framework within us,</p>
<p>upon which the story of each individual can come into being.</p>
<p>Personal grain and color arise from the crossed threads</p>
<p>of our moments and experiences, the fine weft of life,</p>
<p>embedding and obscuring the underlying scaffold</p>
<p>with intricate and sometimes lovely detail.</p>
<p>Here are stories of this fabric fraying in those who are ill.</p>
<p>In the minds of people for whom the warp</p>
<p>is exposed and raw and revealing.</p>
<p>What have you learned about human beings,</p>
<p>human nature and the human mind,</p>
<p>from those who suffer from psychiatric maladies,</p>
<p>for those for whom this fabric is warped?</p>
<p>And one thing we learn as biologists</p>
<p>is that when something breaks,</p>
<p>you see what the original unbroken part was for.</p>
<p>And we see this in genetics, we see this in biochemistry.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s known that when you have a mutated gene,</p>
<p>sometimes the gene is turned up in strength</p>
<p>or turned down in strength,</p>
<p>and that lets you see what it was originally for.</p>
<p>You can infer true function from dysfunction.</p>
<p>And this is a theme that I thought needed to be shared</p>
<p>and needed to be made communicable</p>
<p>to the lay public, to everybody.</p>
<p>People who, which is, I think, almost all of us,</p>
<p>who think and care about the inner workings of our mind,</p>
<p>but who also care for those who have been suffering,</p>
<p>who have mental health disorders, who face challenges.</p>
<p>But then more broadly,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a very much larger story than the present.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a story to be told</p>
<p>where the protagonist really is the human mind.</p>
<p>And that was one thing I wanted to share as well</p>
<p>in projections, is that broader story,</p>
<p>but still anchored in the moment of patients,</p>
<p>of people, of experiences of the moment.</p>
<p>Is there a clear line between dysfunction and function,</p>
<p>disorder and order?</p>
<p>This is always debated in psychiatry,</p>
<p>probably more so than any other medical specialty.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a psychiatrist, I treat patients still.</p>
<p>I see acutely ill people who come to the emergency room</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s no doubt that this is not something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s working well, where the manifestation of disease</p>
<p>is so powerful, where the person is suffering so greatly,</p>
<p>where they cannot continue as they are.</p>
<p>But of course, it&rsquo;s a spectrum,</p>
<p>and there are people who are closer</p>
<p>to the realm of being able to work okay in their jobs,</p>
<p>but suffer from some small dysfunction.</p>
<p>And everywhere in between.</p>
<p>In psychiatry, we&rsquo;re careful to say</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t call it a disease or a disorder</p>
<p>unless there&rsquo;s a disruption</p>
<p>in social or occupational functioning.</p>
<p>But of course, psychiatry has a long way to go</p>
<p>in terms of developing quantitative tests.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have blood draws, we don&rsquo;t have imaging studies</p>
<p>that we can use to diagnose.</p>
<p>And so that line, ultimately, that you&rsquo;re asking about</p>
<p>between order and disorder, function and dysfunction,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s operational at the moment.</p>
<p>How are things working?</p>
<p>Can we just linger on the terms for a second?</p>
<p>So this disease, dysfunction,</p>
<p>how careful should we be using those words?</p>
<p>Can we just, even in this conversation,</p>
<p>from a sort of technical perspective,</p>
<p>but also a human perspective,</p>
<p>how quick should we be</p>
<p>in saying that schizophrenia, depression, autism,</p>
<p>as we kind of go down across the spectrum</p>
<p>of different maladies,</p>
<p>to use the word dysfunction and disease?</p>
<p>I would say to give ourselves license</p>
<p>to capture the whole spectrum, let&rsquo;s say disorder,</p>
<p>because that captures truly, I think, the essence of it,</p>
<p>which is we need to talk about it when it&rsquo;s not working,</p>
<p>when there&rsquo;s disorder.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the fairest and most inclusive term to use.</p>
<p>So is it fair to assume that basically every member</p>
<p>of the human species suffers from a large number</p>
<p>of disorders then?</p>
<p>Well, we just have to pick which ones are debilitating</p>
<p>for each person?</p>
<p>You know, if you look at the numbers,</p>
<p>there are, if you look at how our mental health disorders</p>
<p>are currently defined,</p>
<p>you can look at population prevalence values</p>
<p>for all these disorders,</p>
<p>and you can come up with estimates</p>
<p>that somebody will have a lifetime prevalence</p>
<p>of having a psychiatric disorder</p>
<p>that approaches 25% or so.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s, and in some studies it could be more,</p>
<p>some studies it could be less.</p>
<p>Now, what do we do with that number?</p>
<p>What does that mean?</p>
<p>And in some ways, that&rsquo;s the essence</p>
<p>of what I was hoping to approach with the book,</p>
<p>is to reflect on this spectrum that exists</p>
<p>for all the disorders.</p>
<p>There is, and taking nothing away from the severity</p>
<p>and the suffering that comes at the extreme end</p>
<p>of these illnesses, but nearly every one of them exists</p>
<p>on a spectrum of severity, from nearly functional</p>
<p>to completely dysfunctional, life threatening,</p>
<p>and even fatal.</p>
<p>And so that number, 25%, more or less,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t capture that spectrum of severity.</p>
<p>To look at that number, where do those numbers come from?</p>
<p>Is it self report?</p>
<p>Is it people who show up and say, I need help?</p>
<p>Is it somebody else that points out that person needs help?</p>
<p>Or is it like estimates that even go beyond that</p>
<p>for people who don&rsquo;t ask for help</p>
<p>or are suffering quietly alone?</p>
<p>When you look at self report numbers,</p>
<p>then those numbers get even higher, beyond 25% or more.</p>
<p>Those, the most rigorous studies are done</p>
<p>with structured psychiatric interviews</p>
<p>where people who are trained in eliciting symptoms carefully</p>
<p>do complete psychiatric inventories of individuals.</p>
<p>And these are time consuming laborious studies</p>
<p>that are not often repeated.</p>
<p>When they&rsquo;re done, they&rsquo;re done well.</p>
<p>But very often you&rsquo;ll see a report or something</p>
<p>in the news of a very high number</p>
<p>for some disorder or symptom.</p>
<p>And very often, if it&rsquo;s shockingly high,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s coming from a self report of a person.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s another issue that we have, again,</p>
<p>take nothing away from the severity and reality</p>
<p>and biological nature of these disorders,</p>
<p>which are very genetic, very, you know,</p>
<p>we understand that these are very biological.</p>
<p>And yet, we lack right now the lab tests</p>
<p>and the blood draws to make the diagnoses.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll talk about it, just how biological they are,</p>
<p>because that too is a mystery.</p>
<p>You know, in terms of from our perspective</p>
<p>of how to probe into the disease,</p>
<p>how to understand it, how to help it.</p>
<p>So some of it could be neurobiological,</p>
<p>some of it could be just the dance</p>
<p>of human emotion and interaction.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, is love when it works</p>
<p>and is love when it breaks down biological</p>
<p>or is it something else?</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re gonna talk about it.</p>
<p>But let me just like to linger in terms of disorder.</p>
<p>What about genius?</p>
<p>You know, that sort of cliche saying,</p>
<p>like the madness and genius</p>
<p>that they kind of dance together.</p>
<p>What about if the thing we see as disorder</p>
<p>is actually genius, unheard or misunderstood?</p>
<p>Well, here again, the numbers help us.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s where being rigorous</p>
<p>and quantitative actually really helps.</p>
<p>If you look at disorders like autism</p>
<p>and bipolar disorder and eating disorders,</p>
<p>anorexia nervosa, for example,</p>
<p>these, you know, particularly bipolar and anorexia,</p>
<p>these can be fatal, they can cause immense suffering,</p>
<p>but they are heavily genetic, all three of these.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s very interesting is each one of these three</p>
<p>is actually correlated positively,</p>
<p>positively with measures of intelligence,</p>
<p>of educational attainment, and even of income.</p>
<p>And so you look at this severe disorders</p>
<p>in many cases causing quite an immense morbidity</p>
<p>and mortality, and yet they are positively correlated</p>
<p>at the population level with positive things.</p>
<p>Can you say the three again, autism?</p>
<p>Autism, anorexia, and bipolar disorder.</p>
<p>Bipolar, right.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s that book, forgot the book name,</p>
<p>but is intelligence a burden?</p>
<p>Well, you know, people can get into trouble</p>
<p>when they think they&rsquo;re smarter than they are,</p>
<p>I will say that.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Sometimes, like, in the deepest meaning of that statement,</p>
<p>I think ignorance is bliss.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a big fan of Prince Mishkin from The Idiot</p>
<p>and Aliosha from Brother Karamazov.</p>
<p>Optimism can be seen as naivety and dumbness,</p>
<p>but I think it&rsquo;s a kind of deep intelligence.</p>
<p>Maybe inability to reason sort of about the mechanics</p>
<p>of the world, but instead kind of feel the world.</p>
<p>It seems like that&rsquo;s one of the paths to happiness.</p>
<p>There is.</p>
<p>How much you think versus how much you feel,</p>
<p>this comes up all the time.</p>
<p>In medicine, we encounter this all the time.</p>
<p>Day after day, you encounter the abyss of suffering</p>
<p>from patients.</p>
<p>How much do you let yourself feel?</p>
<p>Or how much do you make it abstract and objective</p>
<p>and try to make it clinical?</p>
<p>And that range, how you&rsquo;re able to move yourself</p>
<p>on that spectrum, is very important for survival</p>
<p>as a physician, and the way you protect yourself</p>
<p>and your feelings turns out to be very important.</p>
<p>You quote Finnegan&rsquo;s Wake, mad props for that,</p>
<p>James Joyce book.</p>
<p>I took a class in James Joyce in college.</p>
<p>I think I read parts of Finnegan&rsquo;s Wake.</p>
<p>I might have been on drugs of some kind,</p>
<p>or I somehow got an A in that class,</p>
<p>which probably refers to some kind of curve</p>
<p>where nobody understood anything.</p>
<p>The only thing I understood and really enjoyed</p>
<p>is his short stories, The Dead, and then Ulysses.</p>
<p>I kind of, I think, read a few Cliff Notes</p>
<p>that kind of got to the point,</p>
<p>and then Finnegan&rsquo;s Wake was just a hopeless.</p>
<p>For people who haven&rsquo;t looked at it,</p>
<p>maybe you can elucidate to me better,</p>
<p>but I felt like I was reading things, words,</p>
<p>and the words made sense, like standing next to each other,</p>
<p>but when you kind of read for a while,</p>
<p>you realize you didn&rsquo;t actually understand</p>
<p>anything that was said.</p>
<p>Right, but did you have a feeling, though?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one thing I found interesting about Finnegan&rsquo;s Wake.</p>
<p>I never fully understood it,</p>
<p>but the words caused feelings in me,</p>
<p>which I found fascinating,</p>
<p>and sometimes I couldn&rsquo;t predict it</p>
<p>from the semantic black and white context</p>
<p>of what I was seeing in front of me on the page,</p>
<p>but the rhythm or the melody</p>
<p>would make me feel certain ways,</p>
<p>and that was what I always was intrigued by with Joyce.</p>
<p>Of course, that was his, he existed on a spectrum, too,</p>
<p>and he wrote, as you say, more accessible works.</p>
<p>I learned a lot about Irish history</p>
<p>from Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man,</p>
<p>and there was just, he could be as objective</p>
<p>as he wanted to be, but then when he let himself loose,</p>
<p>he was in this realm where the words</p>
<p>had their own purpose separate from semantic meaning</p>
<p>from their dry dictionary definition.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s a funny story that was told,</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t matter if it&rsquo;s true or not,</p>
<p>but they said that James Joyce, when he was young,</p>
<p>when he was in his teen years,</p>
<p>would go around sort of Ireland drinking and so on</p>
<p>and telling everybody that he&rsquo;s going to be one of,</p>
<p>if not the greatest writers of the 20th century,</p>
<p>and he turned out to be that.</p>
<p>So I always think about that little story</p>
<p>that somebody told me,</p>
<p>because I have a lot of people come up to me,</p>
<p>including myself, I&rsquo;m a bit of a dreamer.</p>
<p>You get into certain moods where you say</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to be the greatest anything ever.</p>
<p>You get people tell you this, especially young people,</p>
<p>and it kind of, it makes me feel all kinds of ways,</p>
<p>but that story reminds me that you just might be</p>
<p>one of the greatest writers of the 21st century,</p>
<p>for example, if somebody were to tell me that,</p>
<p>and don&rsquo;t immediately disregard that,</p>
<p>because one of the people that say that,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s almost like a precondition,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a good requirement just to believe in yourself.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s not a full requirement,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s an interesting story.</p>
<p>I think when someone tells you that,</p>
<p>then it creates, one sees an opportunity,</p>
<p>and then it would be a tragedy</p>
<p>if the opportunity weren&rsquo;t captured, right?</p>
<p>And so then that creates some impetus,</p>
<p>some motivation to do something good.</p>
<p>I think the mind, it&rsquo;s like, I guess that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>books or whatever, I don&rsquo;t even know if it&rsquo;s a book,</p>
<p>The Secret plugs into, they kind of make</p>
<p>a whole industry out of it.</p>
<p>But there is something about the mind</p>
<p>believing something, making it a reality.</p>
<p>It is just time and time again with Steve Jobs,</p>
<p>your belief in yourself, your belief in an idea,</p>
<p>sort of embracing the me versus the world,</p>
<p>embracing the madness of this idea</p>
<p>and making it a life pursuit,</p>
<p>somehow morphs reality around you</p>
<p>for some tiny fraction of the population.</p>
<p>For everybody else, you descend into</p>
<p>all the beautiful ways that failure</p>
<p>materializes in our lifetime.</p>
<p>Well, you know, you mentioned love earlier.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s a great example of how</p>
<p>belief in something makes it real, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not reasonable on the face of it,</p>
<p>but because you believe it&rsquo;s reasonable,</p>
<p>then it actually does become reasonable,</p>
<p>and then it is real.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s a good example.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t happen.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also in a bioengineering department.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t imagine that a bridge is soundly built</p>
<p>and then it is soundly built.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s something that, it doesn&rsquo;t come up</p>
<p>in too many realms of human existence,</p>
<p>but love is one of them.</p>
<p>And the ability to have a fixed idea</p>
<p>and to say it&rsquo;s true, and then it is true.</p>
<p>A bridge is a kind of manifestation of love.</p>
<p>So maybe it does work a little bit,</p>
<p>but it can break down like Chernobyl did.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t just say it&rsquo;s safe.</p>
<p>You have to also prove it&rsquo;s safe.</p>
<p>But on Finnegan&rsquo;s Wake, I think,</p>
<p>maybe correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re using kind of Finnegan&rsquo;s Wake</p>
<p>to give one perspective on what madness is,</p>
<p>of what&rsquo;s going on in the mind.</p>
<p>How much of that is that we&rsquo;re simply unable</p>
<p>to communicate with the person</p>
<p>on the other side of their mind?</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s almost like a little person inside the brain</p>
<p>and they have some circuitry that&rsquo;s used</p>
<p>to communicate emotion, communicate ideas</p>
<p>to the outside world.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s something about that circuitry</p>
<p>that makes it difficult to communicate</p>
<p>with the little person on the other side.</p>
<p>So if you look at what shows up in schizophrenia,</p>
<p>with many cases, what we call thought disorders,</p>
<p>what we call the individual speech symptoms</p>
<p>of schizophrenia, Finnegan&rsquo;s Wake is loaded with them.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just full of them.</p>
<p>We talk about clang associations in schizophrenia</p>
<p>where the word that is said echoes in some way</p>
<p>the previous word.</p>
<p>And we call that a clang association</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s no other reason</p>
<p>than the similarity of the sound,</p>
<p>like a clang of a garage door being hit.</p>
<p>And it has a, and sometimes it&rsquo;s not even a word,</p>
<p>and we call that a neologism, a new word being created.</p>
<p>And of course, Finnegan&rsquo;s Wake is full of that.</p>
<p>And then we also, in schizophrenia,</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s what we call loose associations</p>
<p>or tangential thought processes,</p>
<p>of course, full of that where things just go off</p>
<p>in directions that are not linear or logical.</p>
<p>And you can&rsquo;t read Finnegan&rsquo;s Wake, I think,</p>
<p>without, certainly as a psychiatrist,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t read it without thinking about schizophrenia.</p>
<p>And then when we look at the families of people</p>
<p>with schizophrenia, and Joyce was no exception,</p>
<p>there very often are people within the family</p>
<p>who are on the spectrum.</p>
<p>Some have it.</p>
<p>Some are able to see it from a distance,</p>
<p>from a safe distance.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an association between schizophrenia</p>
<p>and what we call schizotypal personality disorder</p>
<p>where people are not quite in this severe state</p>
<p>of schizophrenia but have some magical thinking,</p>
<p>have some unusual thought patterns.</p>
<p>Very often, those are family members</p>
<p>of people with schizophrenia.</p>
<p>So this points to this, again, to this idea</p>
<p>that there is a range, even along this very severe,</p>
<p>very genetic biological illness that human beings dwell</p>
<p>on different spots along that spectrum.</p>
<p>I should mention that we have my friend, Sergey,</p>
<p>pulling up stuff, young Sergey or old Sergey,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what to call you,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s drafts of Finnegan&rsquo;s Wake.</p>
<p>Yeah, I actually saw pictures of this from,</p>
<p>I think it was on Instagram or something.</p>
<p>These are early drafts of Finnegan&rsquo;s Wake.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s so beautiful to see.</p>
<p>For people who are just listening,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s just random paragraphs and writing</p>
<p>all over the page with stuff crossed out.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s great to see that Joyce himself</p>
<p>was thinking in this kind of way</p>
<p>as you&rsquo;re putting it together.</p>
<p>How much do you think he was thinking</p>
<p>about the schizophrenic mind?</p>
<p>I think a lot.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s known that his daughter suffered</p>
<p>from schizophrenia.</p>
<p>And this is, what&rsquo;s depicted here on the page</p>
<p>is something that I&rsquo;m sure he either felt himself</p>
<p>in some level was able to access</p>
<p>this nonlinearity of processing</p>
<p>or had seen enough in family that he knew what it was</p>
<p>and was able to reflect it down</p>
<p>in black and white on the paper.</p>
<p>So what he was able to do was quite authentic</p>
<p>in that sense.</p>
<p>Of course, I don&rsquo;t want to pigeonhole him.</p>
<p>He was doing much more than that.</p>
<p>It was much more than talking about altered human</p>
<p>thought processes and thought disorders.</p>
<p>But that was an aspect that he was so good at representing</p>
<p>that it had to be intentional to some extent.</p>
<p>And a tiny tangent.</p>
<p>What does your own writing look like for this book?</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s extremely well written.</p>
<p>How many edits?</p>
<p>Did you just drink some whiskey</p>
<p>and like I&rsquo;m imagining Hemingway style?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s a very different, the writing is very different.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s really, really well written,</p>
<p>which was like, I was reading it.</p>
<p>It makes you realize,</p>
<p>because I was expecting sort of a science kind of,</p>
<p>which it is like elucidating something</p>
<p>about the human mind kind of thing.</p>
<p>But you could also probably write really strong novels.</p>
<p>So maybe that&rsquo;s in the future.</p>
<p>But anyway, what is your, how many edits?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your style?</p>
<p>Does it look like that?</p>
<p>Is it more structured, organized?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I used a laptop,</p>
<p>so I didn&rsquo;t have this sort of a beautiful record.</p>
<p>No typewriters, cigarette, and whiskey.</p>
<p>I did explore which was their particular altered state</p>
<p>that would help me to be most creative.</p>
<p>And I found actually, I actually did the best</p>
<p>while sober, but slightly disinhibited</p>
<p>in the late hours of the night or early morning.</p>
<p>Yeah, particularly late hours of the night there.</p>
<p>I have a friend who would tell me</p>
<p>that she thought that very early in the morning,</p>
<p>her inner critic was still asleep</p>
<p>and she could write more effectively</p>
<p>before her inner critic woke up.</p>
<p>And I actually found that outstanding advice for me</p>
<p>that I often found that I was looser</p>
<p>and could write more in the morning.</p>
<p>But the other interesting thing is each chapter,</p>
<p>each story, it&rsquo;s about a different human being</p>
<p>with a different class of psychiatric disorder.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what each story, each chapter is anchored in.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m trying to use words and style of writing</p>
<p>and diction that captures the feeling of the disorder.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s different in each story.</p>
<p>In the story about mania, which is a very expansive,</p>
<p>exuberant, at least briefly uplifting state</p>
<p>where the words come out in a torrent</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re complex and pressured and elaborate.</p>
<p>I try to capture that feeling</p>
<p>with the words used in that chapter.</p>
<p>And then in the schizophrenia or psychosis chapter,</p>
<p>where things slowly fragment over time</p>
<p>and become looser and separated,</p>
<p>I try to capture that in the writing too.</p>
<p>So for each, it wasn&rsquo;t as if there was a single mode</p>
<p>I could be in for the whole book.</p>
<p>For each chapter, I had to put myself into a different mode</p>
<p>to capture that inner feeling of the disorder.</p>
<p>When you put yourself in that mode, does that change you?</p>
<p>Yeah, I couldn&rsquo;t turn it on and off right away.</p>
<p>I had to, first I would start by thinking about the person</p>
<p>or the people, one or two people based on real patients</p>
<p>and the stories that are put forth.</p>
<p>The symptom descriptions are real,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re from the patients.</p>
<p>Of course, all details change to protect privacy,</p>
<p>but the actual symptom descriptions are real.</p>
<p>And I would sit with them and really try to inhabit</p>
<p>the space of the mind of that person that I knew.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not instantaneous.</p>
<p>It would take some time.</p>
<p>I needed quiet, I needed to be still.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s another reason late at night is good.</p>
<p>Sergey posted that drowsiness gives creativity boosts,</p>
<p>according to Andrew Huberman.</p>
<p>Thank you, Andrew.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not wrong, he&rsquo;s not wrong.</p>
<p>Why projections?</p>
<p>Is it, I mean, instead of putting words into your mouth,</p>
<p>because I can imagine a lot.</p>
<p>I mean, to me, I will start putting words in your mouth,</p>
<p>despite what I just said.</p>
<p>So, I mean, to me, projections,</p>
<p>working on neural networks, for example,</p>
<p>from an artificial neural networks,</p>
<p>from a machine learning perspective,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s often, that&rsquo;s exactly what you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>You have an incredibly complex thing</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re trying to find simple representations</p>
<p>in order for you to make sense of it.</p>
<p>So I was kind of thinking about in that way,</p>
<p>which is like this incredibly complex neural network</p>
<p>that is kind of projecting itself onto the world</p>
<p>through this low bandwidth expression of emotion and speech</p>
<p>and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>And the way it&rsquo;s, we only have that window into your soul,</p>
<p>the eyes and the speech and so on.</p>
<p>So in that way, when there&rsquo;s any kind of disorder,</p>
<p>we get to only see that disorder through that narrow window</p>
<p>as opposed to the full complexity of its origins.</p>
<p>The word projections definitely serves that purpose here,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s got a few other really appropriate</p>
<p>other connotations as well.</p>
<p>So the first thing is a projection</p>
<p>in terms of neuroscience is this long range connection</p>
<p>that goes from one part of the brain to another.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s what binds two parts of our brain together.</p>
<p>There are projections, long range connections</p>
<p>of axons, these are the outgoing threads</p>
<p>that connect one part of the brain to another part.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a projection that links, for example,</p>
<p>auditory cortex where we hear things to reward centers</p>
<p>where we can feel, where feelings of pleasure</p>
<p>and reward are initiated.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s been shown that if you have reduced connectivity</p>
<p>along that dimension, you are less able to enjoy music.</p>
<p>And so these connections, these projections matter.</p>
<p>They define how effectively two parts of the brain</p>
<p>can engage with each other and join together</p>
<p>to form a joint representation of something.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s one meaning, it&rsquo;s pure neuroscience.</p>
<p>The word projection is used all the time.</p>
<p>And it happens to be something that optogenetics,</p>
<p>a technique that maybe we&rsquo;ll talk about a little later</p>
<p>that works particularly well with,</p>
<p>we can use light to turn on or off the activity</p>
<p>along these projections from one spot of the brain</p>
<p>to another.</p>
<p>And this is particularly referring</p>
<p>to the long range connections.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s particularly straightforward</p>
<p>along these long range projections</p>
<p>that connect different parts of the brain,</p>
<p>but it works over shorter range too.</p>
<p>But then there&rsquo;s this other meaning of projections</p>
<p>which you were bringing up, which is very relevant,</p>
<p>which is at some point you can reduce something</p>
<p>from one level of dimensionality to another,</p>
<p>and you can project down into a lower dimensional space,</p>
<p>for example.</p>
<p>And then finally, there&rsquo;s a psychiatric term projections</p>
<p>which comes up all the time, which is we very often</p>
<p>will look at our internal states</p>
<p>and to understand somebody else,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll project them onto somebody else.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll try to understand someone else&rsquo;s behavior</p>
<p>and make sense of it by projecting our own inner feelings,</p>
<p>our own sort of narrative onto them</p>
<p>and use that as a way to help us understand them better.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll do the reverse too.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll take things we see in the outside world</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll bring them into ourselves</p>
<p>and see how well they map, how well they align.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s called introjection.</p>
<p>So projections turns out to be a really rich word.</p>
<p>And then finally, of course, there&rsquo;s the very common</p>
<p>sense of it as a projector that illuminates</p>
<p>by conveying information across space with light.</p>
<p>So for English, for English language,</p>
<p>perfect word to use for this book.</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s funny is not every,</p>
<p>there are a lot of international translations now</p>
<p>and all those rich connotations</p>
<p>aren&rsquo;t captured in other languages.</p>
<p>And so for some translations, connections is used</p>
<p>instead of projections.</p>
<p>In fact, even in England,</p>
<p>the British version is connections instead of projections</p>
<p>because apparently projections</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t have the full connotation, I was told.</p>
<p>So you have to sacrifice some of the rich ambiguity</p>
<p>of meaning with connections, that&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>I mean, connect, man, words are so interesting.</p>
<p>They have so many meaning.</p>
<p>I love language and how much is lost in translation.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very fortunate enough to be able to speak.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not good at languages.</p>
<p>I was just, I guess, forced to by life&rsquo;s circumstance</p>
<p>to learn two languages, Russian and English.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just so interesting to watch</p>
<p>how much of culture, how much of people,</p>
<p>how much of history is lost in translation.</p>
<p>The poetry, the music, the history, the pain,</p>
<p>the way the scientists actually express themselves,</p>
<p>which is funny.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s so sad to see how much brilliant work</p>
<p>that was written in Russian.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a whole culture of science in the Soviet Union</p>
<p>that is now lost.</p>
<p>It makes me wonder, in the modern day,</p>
<p>how much incredible science is going on in China</p>
<p>that is lost in translation.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll never, I mean, that makes me very sad</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ll never learn Chinese in the same way</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve learned English and Russian.</p>
<p>Maybe, whenever I say stuff like that,</p>
<p>people are like, well, there&rsquo;s still time.</p>
<p>But, you know, yeah, that&rsquo;s actually fair,</p>
<p>that I think the 21st century, both China and U.S.</p>
<p>will have very important roles in the scientific development</p>
<p>and we should actually bridge the gap through language.</p>
<p>And that doesn&rsquo;t just mean convincing Chinese</p>
<p>to speak English.</p>
<p>That means also learning Chinese.</p>
<p>Well, we need these bridge people who can do both.</p>
<p>You know, Nabokov, for example, writing in English</p>
<p>beautifully, one of my favorite poets, Borges,</p>
<p>who I mentioned earlier, he wrote both in English</p>
<p>and in Spanish, I think beautifully in both.</p>
<p>We need those people who can serve as bridges</p>
<p>across cultures who really can do both.</p>
<p>You mentioned Borges, so you open your book</p>
<p>with a few lines from a poem by Jorge Luis Borges,</p>
<p>a love poem.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna read parts of it because it&rsquo;s a damn good poem.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called Two English Poems.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s, I&rsquo;d like to understand why you used it</p>
<p>and the specific parts you used, which is interesting.</p>
<p>But then when I read the full thing,</p>
<p>so I think you used it as a sort of beautiful description</p>
<p>of what it means to delve deep into understanding,</p>
<p>offering yourself to the task of understanding</p>
<p>another human being.</p>
<p>But if you look at the full context of the poem,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s also a damn good description of being hit by love</p>
<p>and overtaken by it and sort of,</p>
<p>and trying to figure out how to make sense of the world</p>
<p>now that you&rsquo;ve been stricken by it.</p>
<p>It says a bunch of things about chatting</p>
<p>and significantly with friends and all those kinds of things</p>
<p>and then the poem reads, the big wave brought you.</p>
<p>I get, this is the moment, I guess, of the universe</p>
<p>where the two people you fall in love.</p>
<p>Maybe I&rsquo;m totally misreading this poem, by the way.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t matter, you can&rsquo;t misread a poem.</p>
<p>So it goes on, words, any words, your laughter,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re so lazily and incessantly beautiful.</p>
<p>We talked and you have forgotten the words.</p>
<p>The shattering dawn finds me in a deserted street</p>
<p>of my city, your profile turned away.</p>
<p>The sounds that go to make your name.</p>
<p>The lilt of your laughter.</p>
<p>These are the illustrious toys you have left me.</p>
<p>So these little memories of these peculiar little details,</p>
<p>he remembers, those are the illustrious toys.</p>
<p>I apologize to mix my own words with the poem,</p>
<p>but you should definitely read it.</p>
<p>I turn them over in the dawn, I lose them.</p>
<p>I find them.</p>
<p>I tell them to the few stray dogs</p>
<p>and to the few stray stars of the dawn.</p>
<p>Your dark, rich life.</p>
<p>I must get at you somehow.</p>
<p>I put away those illustrious toys you have left me.</p>
<p>I want your hidden look, your real smile.</p>
<p>That lonely, mocking smile your cool mirror knows.</p>
<p>I want your hidden look, your real smile.</p>
<p>So this is the first part of the poem,</p>
<p>and then it goes on, which is some of the parts</p>
<p>that you reference.</p>
<p>Second part is, what can I hold you with?</p>
<p>I offer you lean streets, desperate sunsets,</p>
<p>the moon of the jagged suburbs.</p>
<p>I offer you the bitterness of a man</p>
<p>who has looked long and long at a lonely moon.</p>
<p>I offer you my ancestors, my dead men,</p>
<p>the ghosts that living men have honored in bronze.</p>
<p>My father&rsquo;s father killed in the frontier of Buenos Aires,</p>
<p>two bullets through his lungs, and so on, so on.</p>
<p>I offer you whatever insights my books may hold,</p>
<p>whatever manliness or humor in my life.</p>
<p>I offer you the loyalty of a man who has never been loyal.</p>
<p>I offer you that carnival of myself</p>
<p>that I have saved somehow, the central heart</p>
<p>that deals not in words, traffics, not with dreams,</p>
<p>and is untouched by time, my joy, and adversities.</p>
<p>And I think this is the part that you include in the book.</p>
<p>I offer you the memory of a yellow rose seen at sunset,</p>
<p>years before you were born, I, damn, that&rsquo;s a good line.</p>
<p>Okay, I offer you explanations of yourself,</p>
<p>theories about yourself,</p>
<p>authentic and surprising news of yourself.</p>
<p>I can give you my loneliness, my darkness,</p>
<p>the hunger of my heart.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to bribe you with uncertainty,</p>
<p>with danger, with defeat.</p>
<p>That is a man who&rsquo;s in love and longing.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;ve taken, but I just wanna go back to,</p>
<p>maybe you could say why you wanted to include that poem,</p>
<p>but also your dark, rich life, I must get at you somehow.</p>
<p>I put away those illustrious toys you have left me at.</p>
<p>I want your hidden look, your real smile,</p>
<p>that lonely, mocking smile, your cool mirror nose.</p>
<p>Sometimes I meet a stranger, and I just,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like a double take.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, who are you?</p>
<p>Have we met before somewhere?</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s that person behind there?</p>
<p>And I wanna get at that, whatever that is.</p>
<p>And of course, maybe that&rsquo;s what love is,</p>
<p>because maybe that&rsquo;s the whole pursuit,</p>
<p>like a lifelong pursuit of getting at that person.</p>
<p>Maybe that&rsquo;s what that is,</p>
<p>and like that insatiable sort of curiosity to keep getting.</p>
<p>Like, well, who is that person in your own private life?</p>
<p>Yeah, so that, absolutely, I think that,</p>
<p>it was a beautiful description of what you just said,</p>
<p>when there&rsquo;s that first moment,</p>
<p>and then you wanna dive deeper.</p>
<p>You want to know what the hidden mysteries are.</p>
<p>In a way, it&rsquo;s a love poem.</p>
<p>As a scientist, though, it also,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a bit of how a scientist can love science,</p>
<p>and that wanting to dive deeper is,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost like, again, where the,</p>
<p>it could be a love affair</p>
<p>with investigating the human mind, for example.</p>
<p>And that was one reason it spoke to me also.</p>
<p>Again, thinking about the broader sweep</p>
<p>of where the human mind came from,</p>
<p>and the steps it took to get where it is today,</p>
<p>what was given up along the way,</p>
<p>what compromises were made.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s where the darkness of the poem</p>
<p>starts to come in a little bit, too.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t shy away from the negativity,</p>
<p>from the confusion, from the danger.</p>
<p>And then at the very end,</p>
<p>the boardface is offering up scenes from his life,</p>
<p>parts of himself, and this is how we connect with people.</p>
<p>We offer up parts of ourselves, just here it is,</p>
<p>and then we see how well does that map onto what you have.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s that offering up that I liked,</p>
<p>and not the good stuff, or not only the good stuff.</p>
<p>The yellow rose is nice,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s offering up the bad stuff, too.</p>
<p>And that, to me, was important for the book,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m offering up hard stuff, too.</p>
<p>In fact, a lot of it.</p>
<p>And also, hard stuff from within me,</p>
<p>from my own personal side, too.</p>
<p>And that was, there&rsquo;s a lot of vulnerability</p>
<p>that comes with that, but that comes with love,</p>
<p>that comes with writing.</p>
<p>You have to be open, you have to be vulnerable.</p>
<p>And so, I thought that reflected what I was trying to do,</p>
<p>and I thought it was, as an epigraph,</p>
<p>it kind of made it clear how vulnerable I was</p>
<p>in taking this step, but also what could come out of it.</p>
<p>And also, in a meta way,</p>
<p>because I was not familiar with this poem,</p>
<p>it made me curious of the poem itself</p>
<p>to pull at that thread of finding out more.</p>
<p>You picked a very particular part</p>
<p>that kind of made you want to pull at that thread,</p>
<p>and see where did these few lines come from?</p>
<p>Because I read it as a curiosity of a scientist,</p>
<p>those lines alone.</p>
<p>And also, as a desperate human being,</p>
<p>searching, like offering himself for an understanding,</p>
<p>or connection with another human being.</p>
<p>And then, because I wasn&rsquo;t sure if it&rsquo;s a love poem or not,</p>
<p>or if it&rsquo;s desperation, or if it&rsquo;s curiosity,</p>
<p>whatever it is, and then you see the love poem.</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t know, that&rsquo;s gonna stick with me</p>
<p>for a while, your dark, rich life.</p>
<p>And then a few lines in here are just,</p>
<p>I mean, those are, I&rsquo;m gonna just use them</p>
<p>as pickup lines at a bar.</p>
<p>I offer you the memory of a yellow rose</p>
<p>seen at sunset years before you were born.</p>
<p>No, that&rsquo;s a pickup line I&rsquo;ve never heard,</p>
<p>if I&rsquo;ve ever heard one, anyway, sorry.</p>
<p>But this is universal.</p>
<p>You see it in so many forms of art.</p>
<p>Like, we&rsquo;re in Texas now,</p>
<p>you see this in country and western songs.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s often a list of things.</p>
<p>Like, here&rsquo;s how I describe myself.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s this, and there&rsquo;s that,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s the other thing, and here you are.</p>
<p>These things matter to me,</p>
<p>and I hope they matter to you, too.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a pretty universal form,</p>
<p>but he did it in this very artful</p>
<p>and very vulnerable way.</p>
<p>It was both beautiful, and you could feel the hurt</p>
<p>coming from him, too, and that was important.</p>
<p>The dark stuff, too.</p>
<p>I offer you my ancestors, my dead men,</p>
<p>the ghosts that living men have honored in bronze,</p>
<p>and talking about two bullets through his lungs,</p>
<p>bearded and dead, wrapped by his soldiers</p>
<p>in the hide of a cow,</p>
<p>a mother&rsquo;s grandfather just 24,</p>
<p>heading a charge of 300 men in Peru,</p>
<p>now ghosts on vanished horses.</p>
<p>So all of it, the whole history of it.</p>
<p>Since it is a love poem, what do you think about love?</p>
<p>Carl, what&rsquo;s the role of love in the human condition?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll talk about the dark stuff.</p>
<p>But maybe love is the dark stuff, too.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s the most powerful connection we can form,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what makes it so important to us.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the strongest and most stable connection</p>
<p>that we can form with another person,</p>
<p>and that matters immensely.</p>
<p>It matters for the human family to have evolved</p>
<p>to be something that could survive against the odds</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve faced over the years.</p>
<p>That unreasonable bond that becomes reasonable</p>
<p>by virtue of its own existence.</p>
<p>And of course, that joy, the wild, raw joy of love,</p>
<p>is not a bad thing, either.</p>
<p>So you put these together,</p>
<p>the strongest bridge we can form,</p>
<p>and the reward and the joy that it brings.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what love is to me,</p>
<p>and from my perspective, this is something that,</p>
<p>it can be hard to capture fairly,</p>
<p>because you wanna talk about the positive</p>
<p>and the negative sides at once.</p>
<p>They need to be wrapped up together</p>
<p>for a full, honest description of what it is,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s hard to do in a compact form.</p>
<p>And so you have to take time to talk about love.</p>
<p>You have to take time to do it justice.</p>
<p>It takes a book, or at least a poem.</p>
<p>Or several thousands of them.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, could you pull up,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a video I saw, yeah, like right here.</p>
<p>So can you pause for a second?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s March of the Penguins.</p>
<p>So you always see penguins huddling together against,</p>
<p>I mean, sorry if I say just metaphors and everything,</p>
<p>but them huddling together against the harshness</p>
<p>of the conditions around them.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s very kind of, that&rsquo;s like a metaphor for life,</p>
<p>like finding this connection.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s kind of what love is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like it allows you to forget whatever the absurdity,</p>
<p>whatever the suffering of life is,</p>
<p>together you get to like huddle for warmth.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why I love sort of just the honesty</p>
<p>and the intensity of the way penguins,</p>
<p>just in the middle of like the cold do this.</p>
<p>And then this video I saw, a lonely,</p>
<p>this is misinformation.</p>
<p>So the name of the video is Lonely Deranged Penguin.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if he&rsquo;s deranged.</p>
<p>So if you play it.</p>
<p>So he left his pack and there&rsquo;s a nice like voiceover</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t need to play it,</p>
<p>but he for some reason left the pack</p>
<p>and journeyed out into the mountains.</p>
<p>And so the narrator says that he&rsquo;s deranged,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s lost his mind.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;d like to project the idea that he&rsquo;s actually,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so many stories you could think of.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s returning to his homeland.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s an outsider thinking,</p>
<p>journeying out into the unknown,</p>
<p>thinking he may be able to discover</p>
<p>something greater than the tribe.</p>
<p>He might be looking for a lost love.</p>
<p>Why is he deranged immediately?</p>
<p>Why has he lost his mind?</p>
<p>Anyway, but this, people should look up this video</p>
<p>because to me, I might be the only one</p>
<p>who romanticizes this, but it&rsquo;s such a nice kind of,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s both a picture of perhaps a mental disorder,</p>
<p>which is what the video kind of describes.</p>
<p>And it may be some deeper explanation</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not, that has to do with the motivation of a mind.</p>
<p>But yeah, I don&rsquo;t know if you have a deeper analysis</p>
<p>on this penguin.</p>
<p>Well, I, like you as a psychiatrist,</p>
<p>I would want to sit down with a penguin and go through,</p>
<p>I want to see the notes from his prior therapist.</p>
<p>But this actually is relevant,</p>
<p>not knowing what was that penguin&rsquo;s motivation.</p>
<p>We have very clear situations</p>
<p>where there are both within an individual,</p>
<p>we go through periods of time when we stay in one place</p>
<p>and we reap the benefits from what we&rsquo;ve built.</p>
<p>And then we go through periods of foraging, of wandering.</p>
<p>Even if there may be resources where we are,</p>
<p>we have periods of time in our lives</p>
<p>where we wander, where we go in an exploratory mode.</p>
<p>And different people express that trait in different ways.</p>
<p>This is not a human specific trait.</p>
<p>If you go down to the tiny little nematode worm,</p>
<p>C. elegans with 302 nervous system cells,</p>
<p>they go through these phases of foraging and rest</p>
<p>and different individuals have different propensity</p>
<p>to forage or to rest and stay in one place.</p>
<p>At the level of the species, that&rsquo;s really good</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s that diversity in their willingness to forage.</p>
<p>Some stay where they are,</p>
<p>the species is somewhat on a firm footing then,</p>
<p>but some carry a burden, a risk for themselves,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s good for the species that they&rsquo;re explorers</p>
<p>and they will venture out.</p>
<p>The migration patterns that different species blunder into</p>
<p>and that turned out to be really good,</p>
<p>they weren&rsquo;t logically derived.</p>
<p>They most certainly started</p>
<p>from something like this, an exploration.</p>
<p>And humans do this too, you think?</p>
<p>And we do it too.</p>
<p>In fact, it&rsquo;s something we do extremely well.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about psychiatry a little bit.</p>
<p>So in my book, you&rsquo;re a rockstar.</p>
<p>First of all, for people who don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>aside from sort of the neurological view of the brain</p>
<p>and neuroscience view of the brain,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re also one of the great psychiatrists of our time.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always, not always, but when I was younger,</p>
<p>I dreamed about being a psychiatrist.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like getting to meet your heroes</p>
<p>and also getting to meet the people who,</p>
<p>the best at the top of the world</p>
<p>at the thing you&rsquo;ve failed to pursue.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m getting a free therapy session on top of that.</p>
<p>Okay, so what big picture, what is the practice,</p>
<p>the goal, the hope of modern psychiatry?</p>
<p>If you could try to describe the discipline</p>
<p>as you see it, maybe historically</p>
<p>throughout the 20th century,</p>
<p>in contrasting to what it is today.</p>
<p>Or maybe if you want to describe</p>
<p>to what you hope psychiatry becomes</p>
<p>or longs to become in the 21st century.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been an interesting journey.</p>
<p>Psychiatry started out pretty firmly grounded</p>
<p>in neurology and pathology.</p>
<p>Some of the initial founders effectively of the field</p>
<p>were very well grounded in microscopy, looking at cells,</p>
<p>working with patients, particularly on the neurological side,</p>
<p>and this certainly included Freud</p>
<p>and some of his contemporaries.</p>
<p>But they rapidly discovered that what they could work with</p>
<p>at the level of cells and microscopy</p>
<p>was so far from the realm of what they could get</p>
<p>from a human being and what they were getting</p>
<p>from the human being was so much more interesting</p>
<p>and was so mysterious and so unknown</p>
<p>that many of them just said,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna inhabit this domain</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re gonna work with the people with their words</p>
<p>and understand what we can based on verbal communication,</p>
<p>because that was the only tool that people really had.</p>
<p>And that was a very important step for the field.</p>
<p>I would say one of the interesting things</p>
<p>that came from the early decades of psychiatry</p>
<p>really was this distinction</p>
<p>between the conscious and the unconscious mind</p>
<p>and paying particular attention to the unconscious mind</p>
<p>as something that was worthy of consideration</p>
<p>that might be important in explaining people&rsquo;s actions</p>
<p>and that perhaps even insight into that was valuable</p>
<p>in its own right.</p>
<p>And out of that, psychoanalysis became a practice</p>
<p>that was not always focused on cures or treatments,</p>
<p>but was more focused on insight.</p>
<p>What does it mean?</p>
<p>How can we help people understand</p>
<p>why they&rsquo;re feeling something or thinking something</p>
<p>or dreaming something?</p>
<p>And that insight separate even from treatment</p>
<p>was an interesting thing.</p>
<p>As long as one was honest about that</p>
<p>and said we&rsquo;re going for understanding,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going for insight.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s useful to just pause on that.</p>
<p>If we look at the father of psychoanalysis, Zygmunt Freud,</p>
<p>what do you make of the ideas that he had?</p>
<p>So you mentioned taking the unconscious,</p>
<p>the subconscious seriously.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like step one,</p>
<p>like that there could be worlds</p>
<p>we do not have direct access for</p>
<p>and we probe at them through conversation</p>
<p>or is that too simplistic</p>
<p>to call psychoanalysis conversation?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not too simplistic, but that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>And I think that was valuable.</p>
<p>Where Freud ended up breaking</p>
<p>from some of his contemporaries,</p>
<p>he was very focused on this unconscious</p>
<p>as being so tightly linked to libido.</p>
<p>And really from his perspective,</p>
<p>you couldn&rsquo;t really separate the operation</p>
<p>of the unconscious mind from these aspects</p>
<p>of the libidinous aspects.</p>
<p>And that was one reason.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s a libidinous aspect?</p>
<p>You know, sexually related drives.</p>
<p>Carl Jung, who was his contemporary,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s one factor that led to them separating</p>
<p>was Carl Jung felt there was a lot more</p>
<p>to the unconscious than this libidinous aspect of it.</p>
<p>And he saw it as a much more complete</p>
<p>alternate representation of the conscious self,</p>
<p>one that maybe reflected a whole range</p>
<p>of different motivations and desires.</p>
<p>And to properly treat it one had to consider all of them</p>
<p>rather than the ones that Freud was focused on.</p>
<p>Carl Jung, shut your mouth.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Thank you for the high level of images</p>
<p>that Sergei&rsquo;s pulling up.</p>
<p>For people who are just listening,</p>
<p>he pulled up a quote from Sigmund Freud&rsquo;s meme,</p>
<p>your mom quote Freud.</p>
<p>So the shadow, the Carl Jung shadow encompasses everything,</p>
<p>not just the desire to have sex with your mother</p>
<p>or sex period.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>If you look at those two folks en masse,</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s a kind of,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost like a technique for philosophical exploration</p>
<p>of human mind, human motivations.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not even like necessarily,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s also doubles as a methodology for helping people,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s almost like a,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a kind of philosophical method.</p>
<p>Right, this is the fascinating thing about psychoanalysis.</p>
<p>And even though it&rsquo;s, I would say,</p>
<p>mostly not considered a treatment today,</p>
<p>it persists for a couple of reasons.</p>
<p>One is it&rsquo;s thought that it gives people some insight.</p>
<p>But second, there&rsquo;s been a huge influence on literature,</p>
<p>on philosophy, on art.</p>
<p>And the opening up of discussion</p>
<p>about what was below our conscious mind</p>
<p>was so fertile in the implications</p>
<p>that it sort of reverberated and still does</p>
<p>throughout all these different realms of human endeavor</p>
<p>from different artistic experiences that people have</p>
<p>that can be colored by this concept of the unconscious.</p>
<p>Now, the other thing that was interesting</p>
<p>is this distinction,</p>
<p>you know, what are the parts of the unconscious?</p>
<p>And so there were these id and ego</p>
<p>and superego subdivisions that,</p>
<p>you know, that Freud, for example, would talk about them.</p>
<p>And the id was the primary, the primal drives</p>
<p>that an infant would have or that a very young child</p>
<p>just warmth and feeding and then later</p>
<p>the sexual or libidinous aspects.</p>
<p>And for Freud, the later happened very quickly.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the controversial thing about him, I think.</p>
<p>I guess he thought like even children had sexual desires,</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re like dealing with, contending with.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s the full thing.</p>
<p>Hungry, wanting to eat, wanting to poop,</p>
<p>wanting to have sex.</p>
<p>Yeah, and he was extremely focused on that aspect.</p>
<p>But then there was the superego,</p>
<p>which brought on these later sort of moralistic</p>
<p>sort of codes of conduct.</p>
<p>And that, of course, was very often in tension,</p>
<p>but all this could play out subconsciously.</p>
<p>And then the ego, this third aspect was mediating,</p>
<p>and Freud&rsquo;s conception mediated this tension</p>
<p>between the different parts.</p>
<p>Now, I think that&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>I will say that in some ways, it&rsquo;s maybe unnecessary</p>
<p>from the perspective of modern neuroscience</p>
<p>to divide things up that way from the moralistic drives</p>
<p>and the primal gratification drives.</p>
<p>In some ways, they&rsquo;re all drives,</p>
<p>and maybe they&rsquo;re even all primal drives.</p>
<p>The moralistic drives, they&rsquo;re taught,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re taught in ways that ultimately relate</p>
<p>back to survival, and you could even say,</p>
<p>selfish aspects of health and life</p>
<p>for the self and family.</p>
<p>And so this is, I think it&rsquo;s maybe an artificial distinction.</p>
<p>The concept of the unconscious is very valuable</p>
<p>and very interesting, but these categorizations</p>
<p>of id and superego may not map onto neurobiology</p>
<p>in any particular way.</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s a town hall of competing drives and desires,</p>
<p>and they interrelate to each other,</p>
<p>they involve different aspects of the brain</p>
<p>and the history of the person,</p>
<p>and actions and choices come out of the result</p>
<p>of that overall shouting in the town hall.</p>
<p>So in some sense, Carl Jung was a step into the direction</p>
<p>of liberating yourself from such harsh categorizations.</p>
<p>Do you think, I mean, you have Daniel Kahneman</p>
<p>with System One and System Two.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just these very compelling categorizations</p>
<p>of the human mind that seem to be sticky</p>
<p>in the superego, no, in how we talk about these ideas</p>
<p>and so on.</p>
<p>Do you think those are helpful or do they get in the way?</p>
<p>Is it some kind of balance in terms of deeper understanding</p>
<p>of how the mind actually works?</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s from modern neuroscience,</p>
<p>whenever we seem to get closer to addressing a question</p>
<p>like this at the level of cells,</p>
<p>it seems to get farther away.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll give you an example of what I mean by that.</p>
<p>So one thing I&rsquo;m doing in my laboratory</p>
<p>and many people are doing is we are listening in</p>
<p>on the activity of cells, neurons in the brain</p>
<p>of mice or rats or fish or monkeys.</p>
<p>Individual cells.</p>
<p>Individual cells, exactly.</p>
<p>Of which there are, in our brain, many billions.</p>
<p>And when we do and we try to predict</p>
<p>what action will be taken by an animal</p>
<p>to address this question, where does the choice arise?</p>
<p>Where does the impetus to make a particular selection</p>
<p>of one action versus another action,</p>
<p>where does that start in the brain?</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re recording, listening in on the activity of cells</p>
<p>all across the brain, where&rsquo;s the earliest spot</p>
<p>you can pick up a choice being made?</p>
<p>Well?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s so awesome.</p>
<p>Yeah, at one level, you might think,</p>
<p>how excited would Jung have been to see this</p>
<p>or Freud or the early psychoanalyst</p>
<p>to see where this starts.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not so simple because an emerging theme</p>
<p>in very recent neuroscience,</p>
<p>literally over the last few years,</p>
<p>is that things sort of all start together</p>
<p>all across the brain.</p>
<p>And so you can be recording from the cortex,</p>
<p>this rim of cells at the surface of the brain,</p>
<p>or you can be recording deeper</p>
<p>in a structure called the striatum,</p>
<p>which is a little older.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more tightly linked to action.</p>
<p>And then structures called the thalamus,</p>
<p>other parts of the brain.</p>
<p>And if you record from these,</p>
<p>these all sort of represent the action and the choice</p>
<p>more or less all at about the same time, very close.</p>
<p>And so you can&rsquo;t point to a particular spot and say,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s where the choice or the action originates.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a group.</p>
<p>Finding the free will neuron.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s relevant to that question.</p>
<p>Nobody is close to being able to point to such a thing.</p>
<p>Well, close is a relative term.</p>
<p>And nobody, what I tweet today,</p>
<p>all generalizations are wrong.</p>
<p>So including this one.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s actually talk about that.</p>
<p>So the study of individual cells.</p>
<p>If you could linger on your sense</p>
<p>that as you get closer to that understanding,</p>
<p>it feels like you&rsquo;re getting farther away.</p>
<p>Why is that?</p>
<p>Because that often is the feeling</p>
<p>until you&rsquo;re actually there.</p>
<p>So like, you know, see that&rsquo;s when I&rsquo;m running</p>
<p>and I know there&rsquo;s only a mile left,</p>
<p>it just feels like that mile</p>
<p>is just getting longer and longer,</p>
<p>but eventually you finish.</p>
<p>So maybe we&rsquo;re getting close</p>
<p>to cracking open these beginnings of a sense,</p>
<p>like we&rsquo;ll talk about consciousness</p>
<p>or these very difficult, big questions</p>
<p>about the human mind.</p>
<p>Where do they start?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re right to say we shouldn&rsquo;t generalize</p>
<p>or make absolutist statements,</p>
<p>but I would say right now,</p>
<p>the reason things are looking even harder to crack</p>
<p>than we had initially thought,</p>
<p>we now have the data streams</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve wanted for so long</p>
<p>in terms of activity patterns all across the brain</p>
<p>at the level of cells.</p>
<p>We can literally see what the cells are doing.</p>
<p>Immense data sets.</p>
<p>You know, we get, these are time series</p>
<p>of one individual cell with sub second resolution</p>
<p>and you can collect this from enormous numbers of cells</p>
<p>across the brain.</p>
<p>So very rich data sets that we&rsquo;ve wanted for a long time</p>
<p>and yet having these has not led</p>
<p>to an understanding of truly where actions</p>
<p>initiate in terms of regions or locations.</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s get a few questions on that.</p>
<p>Is the answer, high level question by your intuition,</p>
<p>is the answer within the data?</p>
<p>Or do we need different kind of data?</p>
<p>So we should also say that when you collect data</p>
<p>about the brain, there&rsquo;s like the richness</p>
<p>of information you&rsquo;re collecting,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s also human doing stuff.</p>
<p>And information, so static information about the human</p>
<p>and dynamic information about the human</p>
<p>and you can get them to do different stuff</p>
<p>and you can select different humans</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s part of the collection of data aspect.</p>
<p>So like when you&rsquo;re collecting data about the brain,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some truths that you can,</p>
<p>you know, in machine learning is like annotations,</p>
<p>like supervised learning.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some true things you can hold on to</p>
<p>before you look at the full rich mess complexity</p>
<p>of the human mind.</p>
<p>So given the data you&rsquo;ve looked at,</p>
<p>do you think the answer for the origin of free will</p>
<p>in the human mind can be found?</p>
<p>Well, one amazing thing is that nobody&rsquo;s found it,</p>
<p>but we have these rich data sets</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s a conundrum which is,</p>
<p>is it in the data and we just don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>how to look at it.</p>
<p>Maybe we don&rsquo;t know the right scale,</p>
<p>the right projection to make of the data,</p>
<p>the right way to interpret it.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s where causal testing becomes very valuable</p>
<p>because then instead of just passively observing,</p>
<p>well, here are the activity patterns</p>
<p>and then here&rsquo;s the choice made by the animal.</p>
<p>As we&rsquo;ve gotten more powerful at reaching in</p>
<p>and causing things to happen in the brain,</p>
<p>turning up or down the activity</p>
<p>of certain types of cells or defined populations of cells</p>
<p>and seeing how that affects actions,</p>
<p>these causal perturbations have turned out</p>
<p>to be very valuable.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re just now getting to the point</p>
<p>where we can apply these in very wide swaths of the brain</p>
<p>at cellular resolution and so we&rsquo;re gonna be able,</p>
<p>hopefully to make some headway on this question</p>
<p>with causality and that&rsquo;s the one thing</p>
<p>that optogenetics provides us this way of using light</p>
<p>that we develop to control cells.</p>
<p>This is an untapped, relatively untapped</p>
<p>at this broad brain wide scale</p>
<p>and hopefully we can get there in the near future.</p>
<p>But I would say that the answer may be in the data</p>
<p>but we don&rsquo;t know how to find it.</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s this interactive element</p>
<p>like where you can cause stuff that&rsquo;s really powerful</p>
<p>because you get to, I mean,</p>
<p>as opposed to collecting data passively,</p>
<p>you get your collecting data actively.</p>
<p>So can you maybe describe one of the many things</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re known for, one of the big things</p>
<p>is called optogenetics, what is it?</p>
<p>Optogenetics is a way of causing things to happen.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a way of determining what actually matters</p>
<p>in terms of the activity of the brain</p>
<p>for the amazing things it does,</p>
<p>sensation, cognition, action.</p>
<p>And what it does is it provides activity.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a way of playing in, if you will,</p>
<p>activity patterns into precisely defined cells.</p>
<p>And the way we do it is pretty cool, I think.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, you know, right away there&rsquo;s a problem</p>
<p>if you think about how do we do this?</p>
<p>How could we play in well defined activity patterns</p>
<p>and provide a stream of activity into this cell</p>
<p>and that cell and that cell but not these other cells?</p>
<p>So just for context, we&rsquo;re talking about the brains</p>
<p>of mice, monkeys, humans,</p>
<p>and then the goal is to try to control accurately</p>
<p>the behavior of a single neuron</p>
<p>and then to be able to monitor single collection</p>
<p>of single neurons to then say, well,</p>
<p>to draw some deeper insight about the origins,</p>
<p>first of all, the function of different parts of the brain,</p>
<p>different neurons, different kinds of neurons,</p>
<p>but also the origins of the big things,</p>
<p>the flap of the butterfly wing that leads</p>
<p>to an actual behavioral thing.</p>
<p>Yeah, so if you could, exactly, so if you could turn on</p>
<p>or off the brain or parts of the brain or cell types</p>
<p>or individual cells at the natural rate and rhythm</p>
<p>and timing of normal brain activity,</p>
<p>that would be immensely valuable</p>
<p>because you could determine what actually mattered,</p>
<p>what could cause complex things to happen</p>
<p>and what could prevent complex things from happening</p>
<p>in a specific way.</p>
<p>But right away, you&rsquo;ve got a problem if you wanna do this</p>
<p>and scientists, neuroscientists have wanted to do this</p>
<p>for a long time.</p>
<p>Francis Crick of Double Helix of DNA fame,</p>
<p>he wrote a famous paper in 1999.</p>
<p>He got interested in neuroscience later in life</p>
<p>and he said, what we need in neuroscience is a way</p>
<p>that we could turn on or off the activity</p>
<p>of individual types of neurons in a behaving animal.</p>
<p>And he even said the ideal signal would be light</p>
<p>because it would be fast, it could penetrate</p>
<p>through the brain to some extent.</p>
<p>And he had no idea how to do it.</p>
<p>He said this would probably be very farfetched,</p>
<p>but it would be a good thing.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re actually saying,</p>
<p>like if you wanna do this kind of thing</p>
<p>and you imagine like, how do I get inside the brain?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty difficult.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty difficult and then even once you get in,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard because all brain cells are electrical,</p>
<p>all neurons are electrically activated.</p>
<p>And so if you wanted to use electricity</p>
<p>as what you were putting in,</p>
<p>you won&rsquo;t have any specificity at all.</p>
<p>If you have an electrode, a wire,</p>
<p>and you put it in the brain and you send current through it,</p>
<p>all the cells near the electrode will be stimulated.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like trying to control fish</p>
<p>by spraying them with water.</p>
<p>Yeah, right, because there&rsquo;s already a lot of electricity</p>
<p>going around anyway and you&rsquo;re adding more,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s no specificity</p>
<p>even among the different kinds of cells either</p>
<p>because all around the wire that you&rsquo;ve put in,</p>
<p>there are gonna be so many different cells</p>
<p>doing totally different things,</p>
<p>many of them in opposition to each other.</p>
<p>We know that&rsquo;s one way the brain is set up.</p>
<p>There are parts of the brain</p>
<p>where neurons side by side</p>
<p>are doing completely different things</p>
<p>and maybe even antagonistic to each other.</p>
<p>So what do you do?</p>
<p>How do you play in activity with any kind of specificity?</p>
<p>Well, what you do is use,</p>
<p>what we found is what you can do is</p>
<p>make some cells responsive to light.</p>
<p>Now, normally no cells deep in the brain</p>
<p>really respond to light.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not built for that.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no reason for them to respond to light in there,</p>
<p>which is a great situation to start with</p>
<p>because any light sensitivity you can provide to some cells</p>
<p>will be a huge signal above the noise.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s what we do with optogenetics.</p>
<p>We take genes, bits of DNA from microbes,</p>
<p>single celled organisms,</p>
<p>and these single celled organisms like algae,</p>
<p>they make little proteins</p>
<p>that sit in the surface of their cells</p>
<p>that receive light, capture a photon of light</p>
<p>and open up a little hole in the membrane of the cell</p>
<p>and let charged particles, ions like sodium and potassium</p>
<p>flow across the membrane of the cell.</p>
<p>And that, these algae and bacteria,</p>
<p>they do this for their own reasons</p>
<p>because that helps them move,</p>
<p>it helps them make and use energy.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s a beautiful thing for neuroscience</p>
<p>because movement of ions,</p>
<p>charged particles across the membrane of the cell</p>
<p>is exactly the kind of electricity that neurons work with.</p>
<p>So if we can take this bit of DNA</p>
<p>that encodes this beautiful protein</p>
<p>that turns light into electricity from algae,</p>
<p>and if we can put it into some neurons,</p>
<p>but not other neurons, which we can do using genetic tricks,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;ve got a situation,</p>
<p>then you can shine on the light</p>
<p>and only the cells that have the gene</p>
<p>and that are expressing the gene</p>
<p>will be the initial direct cells</p>
<p>that are activated by the light.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s the essence of optogenetics</p>
<p>is the ability to do that.</p>
<p>We get that initial specificity</p>
<p>that you could never get with an electrode.</p>
<p>So let me say that this is,</p>
<p>we recently got the Alaska Prize for this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a brilliant idea.</p>
<p>So I talked to Andrew Huberman,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s a friend of yours, friend of mine,</p>
<p>so not to jinx things,</p>
<p>but he believes that you deserve the Nobel Prize for this.</p>
<p>So, I do too, but what, my votes.</p>
<p>Anyway, the thing is, it doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>Prizes will be all forgotten, all of us will be forgotten.</p>
<p>When the cool idea is a cool idea,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a really powerful idea.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually, the origins of it</p>
<p>you might be interested in are even, are very deep.</p>
<p>There was a botanist in St. Petersburg</p>
<p>named Andre Fomensen.</p>
<p>In 1866, he published a paper</p>
<p>on the single celled green algae.</p>
<p>And he was the botanist who first noticed</p>
<p>that they moved in response to light.</p>
<p>These are tiny single celled algae that have flagella,</p>
<p>so they swim through the water.</p>
<p>And he noticed this, he was a botanist,</p>
<p>and he published this.</p>
<p>It was a paper, you know, he wrote in German,</p>
<p>but he published it in a French journal,</p>
<p>and he was doing it from St. Petersburg,</p>
<p>so it was a very international effort.</p>
<p>But you have to go back to 1866,</p>
<p>and that, I like to highlight how far back</p>
<p>that discovery goes is back to Andre Fomensen.</p>
<p>And this is a, it highlights the value</p>
<p>of just pure basic science discovery.</p>
<p>That always originates somewhere</p>
<p>in the Eastern European block.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t think he expected the splicing</p>
<p>of genetic material from the algae into the human brain.</p>
<p>And one of the cool things we&rsquo;ve been able to do now</p>
<p>with modern methods is to really study these proteins.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;ve discovered some of these proteins,</p>
<p>other groups have as well.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve dived deep into their structure,</p>
<p>just like the double helix structure of DNA</p>
<p>was uncovered with X ray crystallography.</p>
<p>We used the same method in X ray crystallography</p>
<p>to see how these beautiful little proteins work.</p>
<p>We reengineered them for all kinds of function.</p>
<p>We can make them, instead of responding to blue light,</p>
<p>we can make them respond to red light.</p>
<p>We can speed them up, slow them down.</p>
<p>We can make them, with genetic engineering,</p>
<p>we can make them have different ions flow through them.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s this convergence, as you said,</p>
<p>like the botanist in 1866 couldn&rsquo;t have predicted</p>
<p>what we could do with this.</p>
<p>And the fact that we&rsquo;ve been able to discover</p>
<p>how these beautiful proteins work</p>
<p>and then apply them to neuroscience</p>
<p>is really a thrilling story.</p>
<p>Is it possible to achieve scale, do you think, with this?</p>
<p>Meaning, like what is the progress of the next 50 years,</p>
<p>100 years looks like in terms of the precision</p>
<p>and the scale of control of using light?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going so fast it&rsquo;s hard to predict.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give you a sense of it though.</p>
<p>First paper we published in 2005,</p>
<p>that was just encultured neurons.</p>
<p>By 2007, so that was in a dish.</p>
<p>By 2007, we had it working in behaving mice.</p>
<p>By 2009, we had it pretty general.</p>
<p>So we had methods to really make it a versatile method.</p>
<p>It could be applied to essentially any cell.</p>
<p>By 2012, we could get to single cell resolution.</p>
<p>We used light guidance strategies</p>
<p>to target individual cells in the brain of a living mouse.</p>
<p>By 2019, we were able to control up to 20 to 50</p>
<p>individually specified single cells</p>
<p>in the brain of a mouse in ways that specifically changed</p>
<p>its behavior, that could bias its decisions one</p>
<p>way or the other.</p>
<p>In fact, we could take a mouse and without any visual stimulus</p>
<p>at all, we could make it act as if it</p>
<p>had seen a particular visual stimulus</p>
<p>by playing in, using the single cell resolution optogenetics,</p>
<p>a specific pattern of activity into 20 or 25</p>
<p>individually specified cells.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s 2019 to your question of scale.</p>
<p>Now in 2022, we&rsquo;re controlling hundreds</p>
<p>of individually specified single cells</p>
<p>over all of visual cortex of a mouse, all the part</p>
<p>of the brain that is the initial direct target</p>
<p>of the incoming information from the retina.</p>
<p>Are you constrained to specific types of cells currently?</p>
<p>Like you mentioned, long range is easier.</p>
<p>Is there constraints on which cells?</p>
<p>Now there really isn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Now that we have this individual cell guidance,</p>
<p>we can target any individual kind of cell very reliably.</p>
<p>And so now to your question of scale, how far can we go?</p>
<p>Well, things are moving quickly.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to say.</p>
<p>We can access individual cells across the entire brain now.</p>
<p>If you look 10, 20 years in the future,</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;ll surprise ourselves.</p>
<p>But the fact that we&rsquo;re already able to cause</p>
<p>specific perceptions to happen and specific actions</p>
<p>means we&rsquo;re essentially where we want to be.</p>
<p>And now it&rsquo;s a matter of just more experiments,</p>
<p>more discoveries.</p>
<p>But the basic principles are clear now.</p>
<p>The basic capability is there.</p>
<p>Is there a pathway to doing the same for humans?</p>
<p>Optogenetics is primarily, it&rsquo;s a discovery tool</p>
<p>that really is well suited for use in mice and rats</p>
<p>and monkeys because it involves putting in a gene</p>
<p>and also delivering light.</p>
<p>And those are two things that you can do in human beings,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;d want to do in a very careful way.</p>
<p>Now that said, there is actually just less than a year ago,</p>
<p>my friend Botan Droska in Switzerland,</p>
<p>he did the first human optogenetics therapy.</p>
<p>And he published this in the journal Nature Medicine.</p>
<p>So about 10, 12 years ago, he and I</p>
<p>published a paper together where we gave him</p>
<p>one of our optogenetic tools, one</p>
<p>of these light activated regulators of ion flow.</p>
<p>These are called microbial opsins, by the way, opsins.</p>
<p>And he put one of those into an extracted retina</p>
<p>from a human being who had died.</p>
<p>So it was a cadaveric retina.</p>
<p>And he was able to show that optical control in this paper</p>
<p>was able to turn on or off individual cells</p>
<p>in the human retina.</p>
<p>So that was a while back.</p>
<p>He spent about 10 years of going through all the regulatory</p>
<p>hoops and hurdles and going through primate studies.</p>
<p>And finally, he was able to take a human being</p>
<p>with a retinal degeneration syndrome, so someone</p>
<p>who was blind in both eyes.</p>
<p>And he gave one of these opsins into one eye of this human</p>
<p>being who was blind and with the goal</p>
<p>of conferring light sensitivity onto this retina that</p>
<p>was not able to see light.</p>
<p>And he was able to make this person see through that eye.</p>
<p>So he took a blind person.</p>
<p>And the blind person could see now,</p>
<p>could reach for objects selectively on a table.</p>
<p>And he published this in Nature Medicine.</p>
<p>And it was, you know, that&rsquo;s an amazing thing.</p>
<p>Do you know the title of the paper?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s his name again?</p>
<p>Rosca, R O S K A.</p>
<p>And you look up the Nature paper.</p>
<p>Nature Medicine.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s sort of proof of principle.</p>
<p>Now, the retina is very accessible.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s near the surface.</p>
<p>You can use natural light, or you</p>
<p>can use brighter natural light.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m myself, I see optogenetics as a discovery tool.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a way to figure out the principles by which the brain</p>
<p>works and how it operates.</p>
<p>Partial recovery of visual function</p>
<p>in a blind patient after optogenetic therapy.</p>
<p>So he went through the full process of doing primates</p>
<p>and then going, wow, that&rsquo;s dedication</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s really exciting to see.</p>
<p>As beautiful as that is, and I&rsquo;m glad he did all that work,</p>
<p>there are so many other ways that optogenetics</p>
<p>could help with therapies.</p>
<p>Once you know the principles, then any kind of therapy</p>
<p>can become more powerful.</p>
<p>Once you know the causal cells in a symptom,</p>
<p>like in lack of motivation or inability</p>
<p>to enjoy things or altered sleep or altered energy,</p>
<p>once you know the cells that are causal,</p>
<p>then you can make medications that address those cells.</p>
<p>You could address brain stimulation treatments that</p>
<p>might address those cells.</p>
<p>Also, diagnosis, very effective systematic way of diagnosing,</p>
<p>or at least providing you rich data</p>
<p>to some of these deep questions about schizophrenia,</p>
<p>about bipolar, all of those kinds of things.</p>
<p>The tools are low resolution currently</p>
<p>for determining the degree to which you have a thing</p>
<p>and whether you have a thing at all.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>And so the hope is that&rsquo;s a great example</p>
<p>of how you can cure or you can provide</p>
<p>some relief for a symptom of a person who has</p>
<p>a serious degenerative disease.</p>
<p>But the principles are what we&rsquo;re after,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s why I spend, even though I&rsquo;m a psychiatrist,</p>
<p>even though I still see patients, I&rsquo;m not myself</p>
<p>trying to drive any clinical trials in the lab.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to discover, and then any kind of therapy</p>
<p>could result from that.</p>
<p>What do you think about my friend,</p>
<p>Elon Musk, and his efforts with Neuralink?</p>
<p>So this is another, there&rsquo;s a lot of things to say here,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s a lot of ideas under the umbrella</p>
<p>of Neuralink, but one of them is to use electrical signals</p>
<p>to stimulate, and then you also record,</p>
<p>you collect electrical signals from the brain</p>
<p>at a higher and higher resolution,</p>
<p>and you go implant surgically the methods</p>
<p>by which you do the stimulation and the data collection.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s possible for the ideas of optogenetics</p>
<p>to play well with this, and we can even zoom out</p>
<p>outside of just Neuralink, and just the whole idea</p>
<p>of brain computer interfaces.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts?</p>
<p>Well, I think the engineering that they&rsquo;ve done</p>
<p>is actually pretty cool.</p>
<p>So I like the.</p>
<p>Robots.</p>
<p>Yeah, from the design perspective,</p>
<p>and it was a design approach that wasn&rsquo;t being taken</p>
<p>in academia, and it&rsquo;s great that they did it,</p>
<p>and I think it&rsquo;s pretty cool.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll say that.</p>
<p>Also, there are many ways that you can record</p>
<p>from many thousands of neurons, and that&rsquo;s not the only way.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very interesting way.</p>
<p>We and others are using brain penetrating electrodes</p>
<p>that actually get quite deep.</p>
<p>This whole structure of the brain is very interesting.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the surface cortex, where it&rsquo;s the most recently</p>
<p>emergent part of the brain in evolution.</p>
<p>Mammals have it.</p>
<p>Reptiles have something a little bit like it,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not really the full thing.</p>
<p>This is a very recent thing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what we can access with some of these,</p>
<p>like the Neuralink approach,</p>
<p>and with some of these short electrodes.</p>
<p>This part of the brain, the cortex,</p>
<p>is only a few millimeters thick.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so much that&rsquo;s deep, though, that&rsquo;s so important.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the striatum, there&rsquo;s the thalamus.</p>
<p>There are the parts of the brain that drive motivation,</p>
<p>that drive hunger and thirst and social interaction</p>
<p>and parenting and flight and fear and anxiety.</p>
<p>All these things are, there&rsquo;s so much that&rsquo;s deep</p>
<p>that these surface approaches are not getting to.</p>
<p>And so we and others are using these very long electrodes</p>
<p>that help us get deep, and we can still record</p>
<p>for many cells, many thousands of cells.</p>
<p>We can have multiple of these at once in the same animal.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s a diversity of methods to get to this goal.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s great that people coming from</p>
<p>outside academia will bring ideas</p>
<p>that weren&rsquo;t being worked on, at least approaches.</p>
<p>They may turn out to be synergistic.</p>
<p>These things do work very well with optogenetics</p>
<p>because all these electrical recording methods,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s one channel of information flow.</p>
<p>Light delivery is a separate, more or less independent.</p>
<p>There can be some artifacts that happen,</p>
<p>but if you&rsquo;re careful,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s another independent pathway of information flow.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve done really fun experiments in mice</p>
<p>where we play in patterns of activity with light,</p>
<p>and we record activity from across the brain of a mouse</p>
<p>electrically, and so using optical and electrical together</p>
<p>is extremely powerful.</p>
<p>So like optoelectric brain computer interfaces.</p>
<p>Which, by the way, there&rsquo;s efforts on the computing side</p>
<p>to build optoelectric servers,</p>
<p>so like where you have both electricity.</p>
<p>So because optics is really interesting,</p>
<p>light is a very interesting method of communication</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s, like you said, orthogonal in many ways.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t have some of the constraints of bandwidth</p>
<p>that electricity does going through wires,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re able to,</p>
<p>but less ability to control precisely at scale.</p>
<p>So like there&rsquo;s challenges and there&rsquo;s benefits,</p>
<p>and having those two interplays</p>
<p>really, really, really fascinating,</p>
<p>especially when obviously on the other side</p>
<p>of your signal is a biological mesh, mush, mushy mesh.</p>
<p>Well, the mushy mesh is kind of interesting</p>
<p>because there are problems with light.</p>
<p>Light scatters in the brain,</p>
<p>so the photons don&rsquo;t just go linearly through.</p>
<p>Whenever they hit an interface between fat and water,</p>
<p>lipid and water, they bounce off in different directions.</p>
<p>And so you can come in with all the resolution you want.</p>
<p>You could play in an incredibly detailed,</p>
<p>high resolution pattern of light,</p>
<p>but the photons start scattering quite quickly,</p>
<p>and by the time you&rsquo;ve gone a couple of millimeters deep,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve lost almost all that fine spatial information.</p>
<p>So, but we&rsquo;ve developed workarounds.</p>
<p>The longer wavelength light you use,</p>
<p>if you get into the infrared, there&rsquo;s less scattering.</p>
<p>You can use two photon methods or three photon methods</p>
<p>where the photons have to arrive all together</p>
<p>at the same time.</p>
<p>You can put in fiber optics.</p>
<p>We developed these fiber optic methods in 2007</p>
<p>where you can access these deep structures</p>
<p>with fiber optic methods,</p>
<p>and you can put many of these fiber optics</p>
<p>at the same time in an animal.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve used holographic methods, 3D holograms,</p>
<p>to play in hundreds of individual cell size spots of light,</p>
<p>and we can change those quickly.</p>
<p>So there are a lot of tricks,</p>
<p>a lot of interesting optics engineering</p>
<p>that has come together with neuroscience</p>
<p>in a pretty exciting way.</p>
<p>Well, that is engineering, too.</p>
<p>It was just super, super, super exciting.</p>
<p>I should mention, because I remember I mentioned Elon.</p>
<p>I recently got, for the first time ever, got COVID.</p>
<p>Well, how did I go so long without,</p>
<p>finally, so I&rsquo;m all vaccinated and everything like that.</p>
<p>And so I got, because I think he mentioned it publicly</p>
<p>so I can mention it,</p>
<p>but I won&rsquo;t mention anybody else involved.</p>
<p>But hanging out, we all got, Elon got COVID.</p>
<p>And the interesting thing about,</p>
<p>maybe you can comment about this.</p>
<p>So I was only sick for like a half a day.</p>
<p>I got a fever of like 104.</p>
<p>I just went up and then crashed.</p>
<p>And then I was, now maybe I&rsquo;m just seeing</p>
<p>the silver lining of everything,</p>
<p>but afterwards, I have like a greater clarity</p>
<p>about the world.</p>
<p>You just think it&rsquo;s greater clarity.</p>
<p>Maybe, maybe I just, it was so,</p>
<p>maybe so intensely the mind fog kind of thing</p>
<p>for such a short amount of time.</p>
<p>But the people who were involved were also reporting this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of interesting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, because I do know like the immune system</p>
<p>is involved with the brain in very interesting ways.</p>
<p>So like the human mind also incorporates all these other,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not just the, it&rsquo;s not just the nervous system.</p>
<p>And I just wonder, because everyone always says,</p>
<p>no, not like, everyone always says like COVID</p>
<p>does all these bad things or whatever the disease is</p>
<p>or whatever the virus.</p>
<p>But I wonder like, I hate to be a Steven Pinker on this,</p>
<p>but like, I wonder what the benefits of certain disease are</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re able to recover.</p>
<p>Like what, is there some like, again,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t want to romanticize it,</p>
<p>but if your system goes to some kind of hardship</p>
<p>and you come out on the other end,</p>
<p>I wonder sometimes if there&rsquo;s a greater,</p>
<p>maybe killed off a bunch of neurons</p>
<p>that didn&rsquo;t need anyway,</p>
<p>and they were actually getting in the way.</p>
<p>There were the hater neurons.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Well, that was your inner critic that I was talking about.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>You killed off your critic.</p>
<p>Well, you know, there are mechanisms for what you,</p>
<p>the potential mechanisms for what you&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>There are, there&rsquo;s actually been a fair bit of research</p>
<p>on post COVID neurological function.</p>
<p>Actually, my wife, Michelle Monjay, who&rsquo;s at Stanford,</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s done a lot of this work.</p>
<p>Akiko Iwasaki at Yale has done a lot of this.</p>
<p>But what they found is that there&rsquo;s a loss of myelin.</p>
<p>This is the coating of those long range projections</p>
<p>that go from one part of the brain to another.</p>
<p>Myelin is this sort of insulator</p>
<p>that coats these long range projections</p>
<p>and makes the impulses go faster and more reliably.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s altered function of the myelin producing cells</p>
<p>and altered myelin in the case of COVID.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve looked in both mouse and human brains.</p>
<p>And, but of course it could be very idiosyncratic.</p>
<p>Many people have cognitive problems post COVID.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re definitely aware of that.</p>
<p>So many people report this persistent brain fog</p>
<p>and the ability to function.</p>
<p>But it depends on where the inflammation was.</p>
<p>Maybe the people who have dysfunction post COVID,</p>
<p>they had a global effect.</p>
<p>Maybe you lost some of these projections</p>
<p>that were restraining you in some way.</p>
<p>And these plausibly exist.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s known that there are cell populations</p>
<p>in the prefrontal cortex that actively restrain</p>
<p>deeper structures from expressing what they do.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s theoretically possible that you had a lucky.</p>
<p>Somebody has to get lucky, right?</p>
<p>Somebody has to get lucky, yeah.</p>
<p>Why not me?</p>
<p>All right, if we can actually go back to this idea</p>
<p>of trying through optogenetics</p>
<p>to find origins of when the wave first starts.</p>
<p>Origins of a decision.</p>
<p>Origin of idea.</p>
<p>Origin of maybe consciousness</p>
<p>or the subjective experience.</p>
<p>So origin of things in the mind.</p>
<p>So one thing, Carl Jung, is there a God neuron?</p>
<p>Is there a belief neuron?</p>
<p>Is there, so through this methodology of optogenetics,</p>
<p>can you start getting to where a belief begins</p>
<p>or an idea begins?</p>
<p>And especially looking at the strongest of our beliefs.</p>
<p>Maybe beliefs of love and hate,</p>
<p>but religious belief into something really grand,</p>
<p>on the grandest of scale.</p>
<p>Yeah, neuroscience and neurology point us a little bit.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have an answer to that, but for example.</p>
<p>A lot of these questions I&rsquo;m gonna ask you,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no good answer, but you&rsquo;re providing the tools</p>
<p>that give us hope to find the answer one day.</p>
<p>Yeah, and we have early clues.</p>
<p>So for example, when patients with epilepsy</p>
<p>have experiences of religiosity as part of their seizure</p>
<p>or the aura before their seizure,</p>
<p>very often those are in the temporal lobe,</p>
<p>in these parts of the brain that are at the side.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s an initial clue.</p>
<p>There are also parts of the brain that are involved</p>
<p>in the definition of the self</p>
<p>and defining the borders or boundaries of the self.</p>
<p>And we know this, this is some experiments that we did</p>
<p>in my lab, there&rsquo;s a part of the brain</p>
<p>where if there&rsquo;s a rhythm of a particular type,</p>
<p>you can cause a separation of the sense of self</p>
<p>from the sense of the body.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s normally bound up and unitary,</p>
<p>we normally think of ourself and our body</p>
<p>as pretty tightly bound up together,</p>
<p>those can be separated, it turns out.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t take that for granted.</p>
<p>And there are certain conditions,</p>
<p>certain patterns of activity in one part of the brain</p>
<p>called the retro splenial cortex,</p>
<p>where you can actually separate those two out.</p>
<p>And so if you think about these very big questions,</p>
<p>you know, what is, where are the origins of religiosity?</p>
<p>Where, how do we define the boundaries of who we are</p>
<p>relative to others and to the world?</p>
<p>How do we link ourself to our body</p>
<p>and how can that become separated?</p>
<p>These are actually, believe it or not,</p>
<p>now accessible and rigorously and quantitatively so.</p>
<p>We did an experiment with optogenetics</p>
<p>where we provided this abnormal rhythm</p>
<p>to this particular part of the mouse brain</p>
<p>and we saw this separation of detection of a stimulus</p>
<p>and caring about it.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s like stimulating something about the mouse brain</p>
<p>that affects these neurons that give the conception of self.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re able to dissociate the experience</p>
<p>from the impact of the experience onto you.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right, exactly right.</p>
<p>So like these are the goals of meditation.</p>
<p>These are the goals whenever I get drunk,</p>
<p>pretty much effective.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s not a scientific statement,</p>
<p>just an experiential anecdotal one.</p>
<p>Also psychedelics seek to this,</p>
<p>to attain this kind of state.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s so interesting.</p>
<p>Well, you mentioned psychedelics, you know,</p>
<p>DMT and 5MeO DMT, these create this religious experience,</p>
<p>this connection, people describe them</p>
<p>as a strong connection to God.</p>
<p>That in theory, these are accessible with modern methods.</p>
<p>Now that we have these rich recording methods,</p>
<p>we can explore what are the precise millisecond resolution,</p>
<p>cellular resolution, brain wide manifestations</p>
<p>of these altered states.</p>
<p>So like you could look at an altered state like on DMT,</p>
<p>record it across many people,</p>
<p>and then from there see where do these experiences</p>
<p>originate in the brain in terms of single neurons,</p>
<p>and then how do they propagate</p>
<p>and interact with everything else?</p>
<p>And if there&rsquo;s some kind of common signal,</p>
<p>like how do you narrow down the set of neurons</p>
<p>that are responsible for particular experience</p>
<p>or for a particular behavioral effect?</p>
<p>Yeah, here&rsquo;s where optogenetics is so useful</p>
<p>because anytime you give an agent like ketamine or PCP,</p>
<p>which we used for our dissociation experiments</p>
<p>that I was mentioning,</p>
<p>or you have a psychedelic LSD or DMT</p>
<p>for this altered perceptual state,</p>
<p>if you give either of those,</p>
<p>these change everything across the brain, okay?</p>
<p>So just the fact that you maybe give them to a mouse,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say, or eventually to a human,</p>
<p>you won&rsquo;t know yet which cells to home in on</p>
<p>as the causal players in all this</p>
<p>just by recording the activity.</p>
<p>But then what we found is that optogenetics</p>
<p>providing a causal pattern of activity</p>
<p>guided by what you see can let you test hypotheses.</p>
<p>And we saw this rhythm with ketamine and PCP</p>
<p>for dissociation, and then we said, okay,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s test what&rsquo;s causal.</p>
<p>We came in and provided that rhythm.</p>
<p>We tried a few different things,</p>
<p>but only one of the causal tests we tried</p>
<p>actually caused the behavioral dissociation.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s how we home in on what actually matters.</p>
<p>And is it repeatable once you see the causality?</p>
<p>So like that&rsquo;s one definition of causality</p>
<p>is like you try and it repeats across different mice</p>
<p>and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>And so you could do that for DMT.</p>
<p>You could do that for the really fascinating</p>
<p>mind expanding, thank you, thank you.</p>
<p>So the meme for people just listening,</p>
<p>this is again another disagreement</p>
<p>between Freud and Carl Jung.</p>
<p>Religion and spirituality.</p>
<p>This is the, I guess the ring scene from Lord of the Rings.</p>
<p>Religion and spirituality, Freud says,</p>
<p>cast it into the fire, destroy it.</p>
<p>Carl Jung says, no.</p>
<p>So for people who don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>Sergei is the Slavic Lord of the Meme.</p>
<p>Thank you, I appreciate that.</p>
<p>So what we&rsquo;re talking about,</p>
<p>so there is, I mean, I think a connection</p>
<p>between DMT and religious experiences</p>
<p>are some of these psychedelics.</p>
<p>Do you think it&rsquo;s possible to</p>
<p>sort of stimulate religious experiences?</p>
<p>And so religious experiences are one of the most</p>
<p>deep kind of experiences.</p>
<p>And so here you could first understand</p>
<p>where they originate, how they propagate</p>
<p>through the brain, and then to stimulate them.</p>
<p>And so this is, and these can happen</p>
<p>in people who had no predisposition.</p>
<p>People who are as agnostic or atheistic as you&rsquo;d like,</p>
<p>they can have these, they can feel connected</p>
<p>to God in these states.</p>
<p>Now, to be clear, I&rsquo;m not advocating these.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s safe in human beings,</p>
<p>but we definitely have not yet.</p>
<p>But we definitely can do these experiments in mice,</p>
<p>and that was already very productive</p>
<p>in understanding dissociation.</p>
<p>So we can already imagine making headway on these methods.</p>
<p>And then I had a, and this does map</p>
<p>onto the non psychedelic human experience.</p>
<p>I had a patient who was actually described</p>
<p>in the book Projections.</p>
<p>This was the patient that&rsquo;s in the mania chapter,</p>
<p>the bipolar chapter.</p>
<p>Here was a guy who had never had a psychiatric illness</p>
<p>or symptom in his life.</p>
<p>He was a retirement age gentleman,</p>
<p>and nobody in his family either.</p>
<p>So no family history, no personal history</p>
<p>of any psychiatric illness, and he&rsquo;d never been religious,</p>
<p>particularly before either.</p>
<p>Certainly no passionate type of religion.</p>
<p>But he, not through any psychedelic or drug,</p>
<p>he had a stressful experience,</p>
<p>actually a post 9 11 change in how he was thinking.</p>
<p>And he was pushed into a mania, a manic state,</p>
<p>revealing that he had bipolar,</p>
<p>never before known in this case, in this person.</p>
<p>And his mania, his elevated state in bipolar</p>
<p>included this profound religiosity,</p>
<p>which he had never had before.</p>
<p>And he was preaching in a elevated,</p>
<p>vigorous way to his family.</p>
<p>And so this state can be created in people</p>
<p>even late in life who had no predisposition for it</p>
<p>and even without a neurochemical.</p>
<p>So the causality of that is very interesting to explore.</p>
<p>How did the manic state unleash this religiosity?</p>
<p>But you see that in other realms of psychiatry too.</p>
<p>OCD can manifest as religiosity also.</p>
<p>You can take people who never really had</p>
<p>a religion, never played a powerful role in their life,</p>
<p>but then when their obsessive compulsive symptoms</p>
<p>become severe, they can manifest in this.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;m in that group, so I&rsquo;m a bit OCD.</p>
<p>We have, I think this is subreddits,</p>
<p>when there&rsquo;s oddly satisfying things.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s certain things that are really satisfying</p>
<p>to my OCD, in my mild OCD.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s pretty much a religious experience.</p>
<p>So I understand that if it&rsquo;s not direct,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s at least rhymes.</p>
<p>So maybe can you speak to the,</p>
<p>Sergei&rsquo;s probably desperately scrambling</p>
<p>to pull up oddly satisfying, thank you.</p>
<p>People can check it out themselves.</p>
<p>It is, as the subreddit promises, oddly satisfying.</p>
<p>Can we talk about bipolar and maybe depression?</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s talk about, I mean, I don&rsquo;t know if there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a nice way to discuss the differences</p>
<p>in the full landscape of suffering that&rsquo;s here,</p>
<p>but maybe what is depression?</p>
<p>And what are the types of depression?</p>
<p>What kind of depression have you seen and experienced</p>
<p>and researched and how can people overcome it?</p>
<p>How can humans overcome it and deal with it,</p>
<p>live with it and overcome it?</p>
<p>So this is my clinical specialty.</p>
<p>I see patients in my outpatient clinical work</p>
<p>with treatment resistant depression.</p>
<p>So very hard to treat severe illness</p>
<p>where medications haven&rsquo;t been working.</p>
<p>I also see patients with autism spectrum disorders.</p>
<p>These are my two clinical focal areas,</p>
<p>but then I do emergency room work as well.</p>
<p>But the depression, why do I focus on that?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so, one feels tantalizingly close to helping</p>
<p>these people who are suffering so deeply.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why I focused on it is these are people who,</p>
<p>there may not even be anything situational</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s difficult or challenging in their life.</p>
<p>You can have people who seem to have everything</p>
<p>that you would want.</p>
<p>Every objective measure of their life is fine,</p>
<p>yet they can be just hit with this unstoppable hopelessness</p>
<p>and inability to see into the future,</p>
<p>a discounting of the value of their own action.</p>
<p>Anything they can imagine themselves doing seems worthless</p>
<p>or they are unable to enjoy things.</p>
<p>We call this anhedonia.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no reward, no pleasure, not in food,</p>
<p>social interaction, movies, books,</p>
<p>anything that they would enjoy, positivity gone.</p>
<p>They can have a profound negative internal state,</p>
<p>psychic pain, and these things can seem,</p>
<p>and in the severe cases, are inescapable.</p>
<p>So what is going on?</p>
<p>Why is this state part of human existence?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s got a strong biological, genetic link, we know that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been linked to certain genes,</p>
<p>certain regions of the chromosomes, and twin studies.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a clear genetic link.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t explain everything, but it&rsquo;s a big part of it.</p>
<p>Genetics are a strong contributor.</p>
<p>And although you can have depression</p>
<p>without anything terrible going on in your life,</p>
<p>the symptoms can be made worse by stressors, by trauma.</p>
<p>But at a very deep level,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s nothing we can measure in a person objectively,</p>
<p>so we don&rsquo;t have, there&rsquo;s not a known chemical,</p>
<p>not a known structure that&rsquo;s different,</p>
<p>not a known brain activity pattern</p>
<p>that we can pick up with EEG.</p>
<p>A lot of people are exploring this,</p>
<p>but right now we have no objective measures.</p>
<p>All we do is talk to people and we elicit these symptoms.</p>
<p>We explore them, distinguish them from other possible causes,</p>
<p>and then what do we do?</p>
<p>Well, we have a lot of things that we can do.</p>
<p>Well, we have a range of treatments.</p>
<p>We have medications that can help people,</p>
<p>do help people, but not everybody.</p>
<p>And if they don&rsquo;t work,</p>
<p>then we can go to brain stimulation methods.</p>
<p>We can do things even like electroconvulsive therapy,</p>
<p>which is very effective,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s sort of the final thing we go to in the end.</p>
<p>And so we have treatments.</p>
<p>They work for some people.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t do everything we&rsquo;d like.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s the problem is at a very deep level,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t understand really what&rsquo;s going on in the brain.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have a physical interpretation of the problem.</p>
<p>We have all these symptoms,</p>
<p>but we can&rsquo;t yet point to a set of cells</p>
<p>or a set of circuits or an activity pattern</p>
<p>that is causing major depression,</p>
<p>this disease state per se in human beings.</p>
<p>Why do you think you can&rsquo;t yet</p>
<p>from an optogenetics perspective?</p>
<p>Is it because there&rsquo;s so many possible causes?</p>
<p>Is it so many things involved?</p>
<p>So I think the answer is there are many things involved</p>
<p>and all these different symptoms that I&rsquo;ve mentioned,</p>
<p>those we can study and those we can fix,</p>
<p>the individual symptoms.</p>
<p>And we can do this in animals to be clear.</p>
<p>So in a mouse, for example,</p>
<p>we can instantaneously and precisely</p>
<p>turn up or down the motivation of an animal</p>
<p>to overcome a challenge.</p>
<p>We can turn up or down its ability</p>
<p>to be motivated by, or we think experience reward</p>
<p>from situations or actions.</p>
<p>We can increase its apparent energy level,</p>
<p>its drive to meet challenges.</p>
<p>We can turn up or down social interaction.</p>
<p>All these individual features of depression,</p>
<p>individual symptoms, we now can point to exact projections</p>
<p>and cells that are causal in mediating these.</p>
<p>But we don&rsquo;t know is why all these different symptoms</p>
<p>show up together in major depression</p>
<p>and the human disease syndrome.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the mystery.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sort of, in other fields of medicine,</p>
<p>someone with congestive heart failure</p>
<p>who comes into the clinic,</p>
<p>they have very different symptoms.</p>
<p>They have shortness of breath and they have swollen feet.</p>
<p>Couldn&rsquo;t be two more different across the body</p>
<p>sets of symptoms.</p>
<p>Neither one obviously related to the heart,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re both happening</p>
<p>because the heart is not working as a pump, okay?</p>
<p>And now, thankfully in cardiology,</p>
<p>we understand these disparate symptoms</p>
<p>that seem totally unrelated can be completely understood</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s an altered pump action of the heart.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what we are hoping for in psychiatry</p>
<p>and in the study of depression or any disease.</p>
<p>These different symptoms,</p>
<p>the inability to enjoy things, the hopelessness.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the unifying principle?</p>
<p>Yeah, unifying.</p>
<p>I mean, is there some truth to that Tolstoy quote</p>
<p>that all happy families are alike</p>
<p>and each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way?</p>
<p>So basically, I mean, this is the human condition.</p>
<p>And basically, the physicists long to find</p>
<p>a theory of everything, isn&rsquo;t understanding depression</p>
<p>essentially require you to really have</p>
<p>the big theory of everything for the human mind?</p>
<p>I think we, it would certainly be nice to have that,</p>
<p>a theory of everything.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think we need it.</p>
<p>The understatement of the century, it would be nice.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s also a good question if it&rsquo;s possible.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Well, that I have some thoughts on too.</p>
<p>But to this specific question,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think we need a theory of everything.</p>
<p>I think there will be unifying principles we can get to.</p>
<p>But even shy of that, we can treat symptoms</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s a big step.</p>
<p>And as you say, different unhappy families are different,</p>
<p>different unhappy people are different.</p>
<p>If we have somebody who comes to the clinic</p>
<p>and I see someone with a profound anhedonia</p>
<p>as one of their main symptoms,</p>
<p>inability to enjoy things,</p>
<p>and if I know based on optogenetics work and animal work</p>
<p>that a particular medication can treat anhedonia,</p>
<p>even if it doesn&rsquo;t fix major depression in everybody,</p>
<p>if I treat that one symptom in that one person,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a good thing.</p>
<p>And so we don&rsquo;t need the theory of everything</p>
<p>and we don&rsquo;t even need the unifying principle</p>
<p>to help people with insights that come from optogenetics.</p>
<p>How much does talking help for diagnosis</p>
<p>and for treatment, would you say, for depression?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a big part of what we do.</p>
<p>Every good psychiatrist should be pretty adept</p>
<p>in these verbal communications and talk therapy</p>
<p>as part of what they do.</p>
<p>I give medications, I deliver brain stimulation treatments,</p>
<p>but a big, big part of everything I do with every patient</p>
<p>is talk therapy because it works so well together</p>
<p>with these other modalities.</p>
<p>Even alone, it can help people with moderate</p>
<p>or mild depression by itself.</p>
<p>People with severe depression,</p>
<p>people with other psychiatric illnesses that are severe,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t wanna do talk therapy alone,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not gonna do it.</p>
<p>But it still is crucial to do together with the others.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s critical because it&rsquo;s part of how</p>
<p>you reshape cognitions, complex activity patterns,</p>
<p>and you won&rsquo;t get to that with a medication</p>
<p>or a brain stimulation treatment.</p>
<p>Do you have advice for people who suffer</p>
<p>from mild forms of depression or feel as they might,</p>
<p>both for those people, and do you have advice</p>
<p>for people who love the people who suffer</p>
<p>from depression and want to help?</p>
<p>Yeah, one of the incredibly frustrating things</p>
<p>about depression is the very nature of it makes it hard</p>
<p>for the people who suffer to get treatment</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re hopeless,</p>
<p>so they don&rsquo;t think treatment will help.</p>
<p>They have low energy, so they&rsquo;re not motivated</p>
<p>to participate in treatment in many cases.</p>
<p>Sometimes they&rsquo;re actively suicidal.</p>
<p>That certainly doesn&rsquo;t help.</p>
<p>They have all these things that seem to prevent treatment</p>
<p>from being effective.</p>
<p>So the loved ones, that&rsquo;s where the loved ones</p>
<p>are so important, is helping them overcome these barriers</p>
<p>to treatment, the motivation, the safety, and the insight.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s critical, and particularly for the severe cases.</p>
<p>For the mild cases, where people still have some insight</p>
<p>and motivation and energy to get something done,</p>
<p>there are many things you can do.</p>
<p>Exercise is extremely important in mood maintenance.</p>
<p>Regulation of sleep and getting sufficient</p>
<p>and regular enough sleep is very important.</p>
<p>And talk therapy can be helpful in those mild</p>
<p>or moderate cases, just looking at cognitions,</p>
<p>looking at patterns of thought that people</p>
<p>may have fallen into, where they catastrophize,</p>
<p>where they spiral from small things into big things.</p>
<p>A little bit of talk therapy, 10, 12 sessions,</p>
<p>can help people identify those patterns they may have</p>
<p>in themselves that are taking occasional negative thoughts,</p>
<p>which everybody has, and magnifying those</p>
<p>into more persistent negative states.</p>
<p>If you work at this, and it&rsquo;s kind of like homework,</p>
<p>this is what we call cognitive behavioral therapy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very structured, very organized.</p>
<p>You work hard.</p>
<p>It requires insight and motivation,</p>
<p>and you have to be motivated.</p>
<p>But if you are, then you can identify these triggers</p>
<p>that send you down particular pathways.</p>
<p>And work to intercept them.</p>
<p>And that is amazingly very effective</p>
<p>in mild to moderate cases.</p>
<p>So you basically have to train yourself</p>
<p>to see the world as a collection of triggers.</p>
<p>And you have to first understand, like collect the data,</p>
<p>like basically see every experience</p>
<p>as a thing that creates a follow on emotion, a feeling.</p>
<p>And like, I&rsquo;ve learned this, you know, like on social media,</p>
<p>where like early on, you know, like all of us,</p>
<p>you know, I&rsquo;ll say something,</p>
<p>I kind of respond to negativity with negativity.</p>
<p>And then you observe the results of that.</p>
<p>And then over time, you think, wait a minute.</p>
<p>This thing that I&rsquo;ve been doing where</p>
<p>when somebody says, you suck, and you say, no, you suck.</p>
<p>That never produces the result you thought it might.</p>
<p>And so might not want to just, don&rsquo;t say you suck back.</p>
<p>And I do this through a lot of things in life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very fortunate to not suffer from depression,</p>
<p>but first of all, I have had and have people in my life</p>
<p>who do, and also, you know, all of us have depression</p>
<p>who don&rsquo;t suffer from depression, have depression out.</p>
<p>Like, it&rsquo;s always knocking on the door.</p>
<p>Right, yeah.</p>
<p>And so you have mild, I mean,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re very careless with the triggers all around you,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re just, I think all of us have the capacity</p>
<p>to really suffer from that kind of chemical</p>
<p>or psychological or philosophical existential crisis.</p>
<p>But then it raises a question, why are we built this way?</p>
<p>It seems like it doesn&rsquo;t make sense, right?</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s where some of us thinking about</p>
<p>where we came from as the human family</p>
<p>is kind of interesting.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t make sense that somewhere on that spectrum</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s good to detect that there&rsquo;s an array</p>
<p>of adverse forces out there in the world right now</p>
<p>at this moment and to withdraw, to hunker down,</p>
<p>to not fight, not strive, not try to meet the challenge</p>
<p>and outweigh these negative forces</p>
<p>that are present out there.</p>
<p>And that makes a lot of sense, and all animals</p>
<p>that have been studied in one form or another show this.</p>
<p>Even the worm that I mentioned earlier,</p>
<p>C. elegans with 302 neurons, it can effectively give up</p>
<p>in challenging situations.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve done this with zebrafish,</p>
<p>tiny little transparent fish.</p>
<p>You can give them a challenging situation</p>
<p>and they will give up, but then if you stimulate</p>
<p>a couple very specific brain regions in particular ways,</p>
<p>you can motivate them to overcome the challenge.</p>
<p>And if you inhibit those regions,</p>
<p>they give up much more easily than they would otherwise.</p>
<p>You can do this in mice, you can do this in rats.</p>
<p>So this is an ancestral conserve pattern</p>
<p>to detect that things are pretty bad out there</p>
<p>and to conserve energy, to hunker down,</p>
<p>to wait out the storm.</p>
<p>So as you, unfortunately, many of our maladies</p>
<p>have useful roots that contribute to our survival.</p>
<p>So both depression and motivation have uses.</p>
<p>And sometimes it&rsquo;s nice to just shut the hell up</p>
<p>and huddle with the penguins versus,</p>
<p>for some unknown reason, venture out on your own</p>
<p>into the mountains like a David Goggins type character.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the difference to you between,</p>
<p>you see patients, between sort of rigorous psychoanalysis?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you consider talk therapy</p>
<p>and psychoanalysis, are they neighbors,</p>
<p>are they overlapping?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re neighbors.</p>
<p>Psychoanalysis is, they&rsquo;re relatively,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not nearly done as much as the talk therapy,</p>
<p>like the cognitive behavioral therapy I mentioned.</p>
<p>The psychoanalysis is a little more niche now</p>
<p>and partly because it&rsquo;s not, the data isn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>in terms of actual treatment of actual therapeutic effects,</p>
<p>data not as supportive as for cognitive behavioral therapy.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s still interesting as for insight,</p>
<p>people, a lot of people still do it</p>
<p>to gain insight into themselves.</p>
<p>And in general, it&rsquo;s a good sort of conversation starter.</p>
<p>Those methods, they&rsquo;re good for getting things out.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t focus on dreams typically these days</p>
<p>in psychiatry, but they&rsquo;re great conversation starters.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re great ways to get things out if people have,</p>
<p>and so we like to use those methods</p>
<p>just to get the ball rolling sometimes,</p>
<p>get people to open up a little bit.</p>
<p>But the actual treatment tends not to involve</p>
<p>these psychoanalytic approaches where you are really</p>
<p>probing the unconscious mind and its manifestation</p>
<p>through dreams, for example, as the goal.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not the goal.</p>
<p>Modern talk therapy, we&rsquo;re really focusing on treatment,</p>
<p>how to get people to feel better.</p>
<p>See, I use that as a conversation opener,</p>
<p>the Freudian thing where I try to delve at a bar</p>
<p>of the deep sexual desires in a person&rsquo;s subconscious</p>
<p>and I find that opens up possibilities very quickly.</p>
<p>Now, what&rsquo;s, I mean, this is a silly sounding question,</p>
<p>but what&rsquo;s the difference between</p>
<p>cognitive behavioral therapy and conversation?</p>
<p>So, because I personally, as a fan of conversations,</p>
<p>as a fan of just, I like listening to podcasts</p>
<p>versus like audio book, I like both,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re very different and I like conversation.</p>
<p>I like, it makes me personally very anxious,</p>
<p>so I like to be the listener, like a third wheel,</p>
<p>like overhearing a conversation kind of thing,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a really powerful method for humans</p>
<p>to explore each other&rsquo;s mind, just raw conversation.</p>
<p>So, do you think it can be more productive</p>
<p>to be very systematic about it or is conversation itself</p>
<p>the art form of helping each other,</p>
<p>understanding each other and helping each other?</p>
<p>There are forms of talk therapy</p>
<p>that are essentially conversational</p>
<p>or they much more approach pure conversation.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a befriending therapy,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s interpersonal therapy.</p>
<p>These are approaches that are purely talk therapy,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re not as structured</p>
<p>as cognitive behavioral therapy.</p>
<p>Cognitive behavioral therapy is,</p>
<p>there are manuals, there are guidelines.</p>
<p>You can almost go through it in a very cookbooky way.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s homework that you get done.</p>
<p>So, it&rsquo;s in its fullest form,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very different from these</p>
<p>more conversational strategies.</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s interesting is sometimes people compare them</p>
<p>and so you&rsquo;ll see almost like randomized controlled studies</p>
<p>comparing cognitive behavioral therapy</p>
<p>with interpersonal therapy, for example.</p>
<p>And they both can work and actually in some studies,</p>
<p>they look comparable.</p>
<p>So, to your point, conversation and insights</p>
<p>that come from conversation, if done well,</p>
<p>if done artfully, can be as powerful.</p>
<p>This reminds me of Robin Williams.</p>
<p>I have to ask you several questions here on that.</p>
<p>But one of my favorite movies is Good Will Hunting.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ve seen it with Robin Williams.</p>
<p>So, as a psychiatrist yourself,</p>
<p>can you do a deep analysis of this other famous psychiatrist</p>
<p>which is the movie character played by Robin Williams</p>
<p>at Good Will Hunting?</p>
<p>Is it just a caricature between a psychiatrist</p>
<p>and patient relationship?</p>
<p>Or is there something to you that was moving</p>
<p>about his ability to connect</p>
<p>to this obviously struggling young kid?</p>
<p>I think you hit on the key thing there</p>
<p>which is the depth of the connection.</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s too powerful a connection,</p>
<p>that can impair therapy</p>
<p>because it could impair open communication.</p>
<p>If someone, if a patient has a, sees the role,</p>
<p>sees the relationship in a particular way,</p>
<p>like in a friendly way maybe,</p>
<p>or like a parental child type way,</p>
<p>that can cause problems because then what they choose</p>
<p>to share, what they choose to bring up is selected</p>
<p>to be appropriate for that view of the relationship.</p>
<p>And so, I and many other talk therapists actually prefer</p>
<p>not to let things get, not let the connection get that deep.</p>
<p>You wanna have trust.</p>
<p>You wanna have a therapeutic alliance, we sometimes call it.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s got to be enough of a blank slate</p>
<p>that the patient is not consciously</p>
<p>or unconsciously constrained in what they choose to share.</p>
<p>And so, great movie, great actors, all good,</p>
<p>no complaints except realistically,</p>
<p>the relationship should be a little more arm&rsquo;s length</p>
<p>than that.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s pretend this is real life.</p>
<p>Sometimes can&rsquo;t you leave a little bit of yourself</p>
<p>in the interaction with the patient?</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s another human being.</p>
<p>Yes, so there&rsquo;s a balance.</p>
<p>And actually you do need some of it</p>
<p>because let&rsquo;s say this person is having challenges,</p>
<p>interpersonal challenges in their life.</p>
<p>The best way to notice what those are</p>
<p>and to identify them and to work with them</p>
<p>is if you can elicit some of those problems</p>
<p>in the office, in the therapeutic interaction.</p>
<p>And this is really powerful.</p>
<p>As long as you&rsquo;re alert to it, aware of it,</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t let it go out of hand,</p>
<p>this transference, we call it,</p>
<p>is when you transfer in between</p>
<p>the current therapeutic relationship</p>
<p>and external relationships</p>
<p>that the patient may have had with others.</p>
<p>And so if the therapist starts to feel</p>
<p>an inner feeling like anger, let&rsquo;s say.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s say you have a patient</p>
<p>who is stirring frustration in you</p>
<p>or even in extreme cases, anger,</p>
<p>the best thing for the therapist to do in that case</p>
<p>is to recognize it and to realize</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s probably being stirred by other people</p>
<p>in the patient&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>And that could be the source of a lot of problems.</p>
<p>And so instead of trying to wall it off,</p>
<p>and say, oh, I shouldn&rsquo;t be feeling that,</p>
<p>I better be a better therapist instead,</p>
<p>and recognize it and use it,</p>
<p>and help the patient that way.</p>
<p>And so you&rsquo;ve gotta be a human being.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve gotta be a person who feels.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve gotta be open.</p>
<p>But be in control of it and be aware of it.</p>
<p>If I may, I just wanna read,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s one of my favorite scenes.</p>
<p>Probably one of the greatest scenes,</p>
<p>one of the greatest scenes in movie history</p>
<p>because Robin Williams does a single take.</p>
<p>Is that right?</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know that.</p>
<p>So this is a very interesting interaction between them.</p>
<p>So Will, and I&rsquo;m sure this is a common interaction,</p>
<p>maybe with a therapist and a patient,</p>
<p>maybe with a father and son,</p>
<p>where Will, the young character,</p>
<p>the young, brilliant mathematician,</p>
<p>and Sean is the therapist, the older therapist,</p>
<p>where Will looks at a painting that Sean painted</p>
<p>and then does a deep, critical analysis of the painting</p>
<p>that basically describes pretending</p>
<p>as if he can understand another human being completely</p>
<p>by just looking at their painting.</p>
<p>And then Sean gives this whole speech</p>
<p>that contrasts sort of raw intelligence</p>
<p>and the wisdom of experience.</p>
<p>And Sean says, single take.</p>
<p>He says, you&rsquo;ve never been out of Boston, right?</p>
<p>And Will says, nope.</p>
<p>All this in a sexy Boston accent, by the way.</p>
<p>And then Sean gives the speech.</p>
<p>If I asked you about art,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d probably give me the skinny</p>
<p>and about every art book ever written.</p>
<p>Michelangelo, you know a lot about him.</p>
<p>Life&rsquo;s work, political aspirations,</p>
<p>him and the Pope, sexual orientation,</p>
<p>the whole works, right?</p>
<p>But I bet you can&rsquo;t tell me what it smells like</p>
<p>in the Sistine Chapel.</p>
<p>You never actually stood there</p>
<p>and looked up at that beautiful ceiling, seeing that.</p>
<p>If I asked you about women,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll probably give me a syllabus</p>
<p>of your personal favorites.</p>
<p>You may have even been laid a few times.</p>
<p>The language here is just beautiful.</p>
<p>But you can&rsquo;t tell me what it feels like</p>
<p>to wake up next to a woman and feel truly happy.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a tough kid.</p>
<p>If I asked you about war,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d probably throw Shakespeare at me, right?</p>
<p>Probably not, but let&rsquo;s say.</p>
<p>Once more into the breach here, friends.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;ve never been near one.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve never held your best friend&rsquo;s head on your lap</p>
<p>and watched him gasp his last breath,</p>
<p>looking to you for help.</p>
<p>If I asked you about love,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d probably quote me a sonnet.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;ve never looked at a woman</p>
<p>and be truly vulnerable,</p>
<p>known someone who can level you with their eyes,</p>
<p>feeling like God put an angel on earth just for you,</p>
<p>who could rescue you from the depths of hell</p>
<p>and you wouldn&rsquo;t know what it&rsquo;s like to be her angel.</p>
<p>To have that love for her,</p>
<p>be there forever, through anything, through cancer.</p>
<p>And you wouldn&rsquo;t know about sleeping,</p>
<p>sitting up in a hospital room for two months,</p>
<p>holding her hand because the doctors could see in your eyes</p>
<p>the terms visiting hours don&rsquo;t apply to you.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t know about real loss</p>
<p>because that only occurs when you love something</p>
<p>more than you love yourself.</p>
<p>I doubt you&rsquo;ve ever dared to love anybody that much.</p>
<p>I look at you.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see an intelligent, confident man.</p>
<p>I see a cocky, scared, shitless kid.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re a genius, Will.</p>
<p>No one denies that.</p>
<p>No one can possibly understand the depths of you.</p>
<p>But you presume to know everything about me</p>
<p>because you saw a painting of mine</p>
<p>you ripped my fucking life apart.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re an orphan, right?</p>
<p>Do you think I know the first thing</p>
<p>about how hard your life has been,</p>
<p>how you feel, who you are because I read Oliver Twist?</p>
<p>Does that encapsulate you?</p>
<p>Personally, I don&rsquo;t give a shit about all that</p>
<p>because you know what?</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t learn anything from you</p>
<p>that I can&rsquo;t read in some fucking book</p>
<p>unless you want to talk about you, who you are.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m fascinated, I&rsquo;m in.</p>
<p>But you don&rsquo;t want to do that, do you, sport?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re terrified of what you might say.</p>
<p>Your move, chief.</p>
<p>Well done, sir, I know it&rsquo;s a movie.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting, right?</p>
<p>So some of that conversation</p>
<p>is at some intellectual level, too.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just emotional, it&rsquo;s something,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, the reason I kind of connect with that is</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a lot of work for a therapist.</p>
<p>Like, to really understand another,</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s, I mean, from, okay, I know this is fictional,</p>
<p>but just, there&rsquo;s calculation happening.</p>
<p>He deeply cares to say the words</p>
<p>that the other person needs to hear,</p>
<p>but also a little bit loses himself in the pride,</p>
<p>but then catches himself again,</p>
<p>switches from anger to connection.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>A lot is brought up there.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re right, there has to be some emotion</p>
<p>in the therapist to care enough to keep going,</p>
<p>to keep probing, to open up as he&rsquo;s doing so, right?</p>
<p>He revealed a lot about himself, his own vulnerabilities,</p>
<p>but that gave him authenticity.</p>
<p>He had to open himself up</p>
<p>so that the kid would see the authenticity</p>
<p>and open himself up in return.</p>
<p>So how do you do that as a psychiatrist, as a therapist?</p>
<p>You have to be careful.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t wanna do too much,</p>
<p>but opening up a little bit does help.</p>
<p>It does create a chance.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re offering up something</p>
<p>and that helps the patient come back in return,</p>
<p>and it gives you that believability and authenticity.</p>
<p>Do you pay the price for that, for opening it up?</p>
<p>You can.</p>
<p>You have a family.</p>
<p>You have an incredibly difficult research.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re doing a lot of things in your world.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s the price you pay for like.</p>
<p>Well, this was one of the terrifying things</p>
<p>about writing the book was I do open up</p>
<p>in a little bit about my own personal life,</p>
<p>my own personal challenges,</p>
<p>and that was a considered decision</p>
<p>because I could have done the patient work</p>
<p>and the science work</p>
<p>and the history of the human family work</p>
<p>and tied it all together,</p>
<p>but it wasn&rsquo;t, and in an early draft, it was like that,</p>
<p>but it wasn&rsquo;t real yet.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t something that everybody could connect with,</p>
<p>and I said, then I realized, look, if I&rsquo;m gonna do this,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve gotta open up myself,</p>
<p>and then people can connect with me</p>
<p>and see what I&rsquo;m really saying, and so I did,</p>
<p>and that was not something that I&rsquo;d gone in planning to do.</p>
<p>In retrospect, I learned a lot about myself.</p>
<p>It was actually really, I think, a good thing that I did,</p>
<p>but it was scary.</p>
<p>Where are the darkest places you&rsquo;ve ever gone in your life?</p>
<p>You know, I had, things haven&rsquo;t always been easy,</p>
<p>personally or professionally.</p>
<p>I had moments, you know, I was effectively a single dad</p>
<p>for a while, a number of years,</p>
<p>and these came at probably the hardest,</p>
<p>also, professional lifetimes for me, too,</p>
<p>the absolute hardest days of late medical school,</p>
<p>internship, taking call, getting up at 3 a.m.,</p>
<p>surgery, medicine, rounds, unforgiving environments,</p>
<p>and then all the while, personal life,</p>
<p>stripped down to the bare, and these were low moments,</p>
<p>and then I was hit particularly hard by</p>
<p>just experiences on the clinical ward,</p>
<p>connecting too deeply with patients,</p>
<p>like a child with a brain tumor,</p>
<p>and feeling it too strongly, and those things,</p>
<p>when you get down to those lowest of the low moments,</p>
<p>when everything is stripped away,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s only this raw core,</p>
<p>well, that&rsquo;s pretty hard.</p>
<p>That was probably the lowest moment,</p>
<p>and you learn a lot about yourself in those moments,</p>
<p>you know, what&rsquo;s left, and then what are the roots out</p>
<p>from there, and that can be powerful to see in yourself.</p>
<p>Have you thought about killing yourself?</p>
<p>I have not.</p>
<p>Have you seen that thought in the distance?</p>
<p>I am fortunate that that has not come to my mind,</p>
<p>and I have not seen it, even in the distance,</p>
<p>and in some ways, I&rsquo;ve wondered if that&rsquo;s made me,</p>
<p>am I a less effective psychiatrist because of that?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been, I&rsquo;ve felt everything stripped away.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been at the lowest of the low, and yet, that.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s still hope.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a light of hope still at the end of the tunnel.</p>
<p>So you never lost, even for brief moments, that.</p>
<p>Never did.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t know why.</p>
<p>There was no reason.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t know why.</p>
<p>No reason to feel hope at that moment, honestly.</p>
<p>Uh, so it was just the light without reason.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>What wisdom do you draw from that time?</p>
<p>About, so first of all, you said something funny,</p>
<p>which is, I wonder if it, that it&rsquo;s somehow</p>
<p>not having thoughts of suicide limits your capacity</p>
<p>to truly understand somebody who is having those thoughts.</p>
<p>So how many demons must a psychiatrist have</p>
<p>in order to be a good psychiatrist?</p>
<p>You know, this is a really interesting question.</p>
<p>I think everybody knows, and I can say this,</p>
<p>that psychiatrists can be a little unusual.</p>
<p>We think about ourselves, right?</p>
<p>We think about our brains.</p>
<p>That may be one reason why we become psychiatrists</p>
<p>is we think, oh, that&rsquo;s interesting going on in there.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s that about?</p>
<p>So a little introspective, a little introverted maybe,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what can make us good when we&rsquo;re good.</p>
<p>And, but also that may select for people</p>
<p>who have some unusual aspects,</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t have to have all of them.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot that can go wrong in the psychiatric realm.</p>
<p>I think having some of those, some of it,</p>
<p>but not all of it is enough.</p>
<p>You get to see how low things can get.</p>
<p>You can get, you get empathy from that,</p>
<p>even if the symptoms are not the same.</p>
<p>Just empathy for struggle, for suffering.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Do you yourself have to practice observing triggers</p>
<p>just as a human operating in this world?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve definitely, those skills that have come from therapy,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve found them useful, yeah.</p>
<p>If I noticed that, we&rsquo;ve all been through experiences</p>
<p>where we wonder, oh, I got really mad in that interaction.</p>
<p>Why did I get that mad?</p>
<p>Yeah, sure, maybe I could have been irritated,</p>
<p>but man, why did I?</p>
<p>And then thinking about it and realizing,</p>
<p>okay, back up here, think about the broader context.</p>
<p>Think about how that relates to prior events in my life.</p>
<p>Okay, yeah, so this is a thing for me</p>
<p>when something of this class happens, then it triggers me.</p>
<p>So going forward, I&rsquo;m gonna be aware of that.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve definitely used that</p>
<p>because you don&rsquo;t wanna be out of control of those emotions.</p>
<p>You wanna identify them.</p>
<p>You wanna know where they come from</p>
<p>and you wanna head them off</p>
<p>as a civilized human being living on this earth,</p>
<p>trying to get along with other people.</p>
<p>You wanna understand those moments.</p>
<p>Let me return to Robin Williams for a second</p>
<p>and looking at Robin Williams, the actor,</p>
<p>sorry, the human,</p>
<p>because you mentioned for depression,</p>
<p>you can have everything going well.</p>
<p>And I think there&rsquo;s just famous cases of just public figures</p>
<p>because a lot of people know them,</p>
<p>where they suffer quietly</p>
<p>and it seems like from the outside perspective</p>
<p>that they have everything going for them,</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re at the top of their career.</p>
<p>Two people that come to mind</p>
<p>are Robin Williams and Anthony Bourdain.</p>
<p>What insight do you have in why either of those have taken,</p>
<p>why Robin Williams, a comedian,</p>
<p>one of sort of the most jolly humans?</p>
<p>Obviously, there was always the darkness</p>
<p>that he was channeling in order to present the happiness,</p>
<p>but it feels like that realness is only possible</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re deeply self honest and analytical</p>
<p>and then if you&rsquo;re deeply self honest,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to realize that there&rsquo;s a lot</p>
<p>of beautiful things about life that you can discover</p>
<p>and if you do that,</p>
<p>how can you possibly then take your own life?</p>
<p>I mean, you go through all of these thoughts</p>
<p>and I think a lot of people really loved Robin Williams,</p>
<p>which is why it was really difficult to see</p>
<p>how can even him, how can even Robin Williams</p>
<p>take his own life?</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know if there&rsquo;s something to be said</p>
<p>about the nature of depression</p>
<p>from just looking at his case.</p>
<p>I think the action of suicide is not well understood.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t always, although often,</p>
<p>is correlated with depression.</p>
<p>There are cases of suicide where there is not</p>
<p>clear depression, that&rsquo;s in the minority.</p>
<p>By the way, if I just,</p>
<p>because you said it so interesting,</p>
<p>action of suicide, because there&rsquo;s also thoughts of suicide</p>
<p>and probably those, they&rsquo;re probably somewhat understood,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s an interesting, because you can think of suicide,</p>
<p>if you have suicidal ideation,</p>
<p>you can think of that for so many reasons.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>And I mean, thoughts sometimes, like painful thoughts,</p>
<p>angry thoughts, or thoughts in general,</p>
<p>can be very different, like fantasies, for example.</p>
<p>You can fantasize, like sexual fantasies.</p>
<p>You can fantasize, I was just for humor&rsquo;s sake</p>
<p>wanted to mention stuff, but then people think I&rsquo;m serious,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m not gonna mention anything.</p>
<p>But sexual fantasies, and then there&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>I know there&rsquo;s people that have sexual fantasies</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t wanna actually do that in real life.</p>
<p>That sexual fantasy serves some kind of purpose</p>
<p>in imagination only, and in that same way,</p>
<p>suicide might serve a purpose in imagination only,</p>
<p>is very unlikely to lead to action.</p>
<p>And yet there&rsquo;s other thoughts that maybe are more amorphous</p>
<p>that do lead to action, and that leap,</p>
<p>yeah, that, oh boy, that&rsquo;s a fascinating,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s such a philosophically powerful thought</p>
<p>to not exist, like that question, that&rsquo;s the,</p>
<p>is it Sarcher or Camus, Camus?</p>
<p>Well, the myth is Sisyphus, Camus, who says,</p>
<p>like basic question of why live?</p>
<p>Good question.</p>
<p>Yeah, right.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a great question, actually,</p>
<p>and there are other related questions.</p>
<p>Some people may have the thought of suicide</p>
<p>because there seems no point, there&rsquo;s no joy in life.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one reason that some people can put forward.</p>
<p>Sometimes there&rsquo;s an, it&rsquo;s not just the absence of joy,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an active pain, an active psychic pain</p>
<p>in some people, and that, the inescapability of that</p>
<p>is enough to drive the thoughts of suicide.</p>
<p>And then there are interpersonal and cultural reasons</p>
<p>as well that can show up.</p>
<p>But the act, this act of ending of the self is,</p>
<p>in all these cases, there&rsquo;s no real way to study this</p>
<p>in animals, no other animal as far as we know</p>
<p>that we can study has this concept of this is myself,</p>
<p>the situation is not tolerable, therefore,</p>
<p>I will end the self.</p>
<p>To our knowledge, this is not something</p>
<p>that can be studied in other animals.</p>
<p>So it remains this very poorly understood action.</p>
<p>And in predicting it, so what do we do as psychiatrists?</p>
<p>We have this challenge.</p>
<p>People come to the emergency room, they say they&rsquo;re suicidal</p>
<p>or their friends say they&rsquo;re suicidal</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;ve taken some action that didn&rsquo;t lead to death.</p>
<p>What do we do?</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s a whole range of options.</p>
<p>Was it a suicidal gesture in the sense</p>
<p>of not intending death or was the intent death?</p>
<p>And if it was the intent was death,</p>
<p>what were the reasons?</p>
<p>Are the reasons transient?</p>
<p>Are they gone now?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the probability that it&rsquo;ll be repeated?</p>
<p>So we do all these things just to decide</p>
<p>what sort of treatment should be carried out,</p>
<p>but nowhere is there a deep understanding of the biology,</p>
<p>of the cells and circuits and activity patterns</p>
<p>that underlie the action to end the self.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very, it&rsquo;s this frustrating thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so timely, it&rsquo;s so common, it shows up in veterans,</p>
<p>it shows up in kids, it shows up in people</p>
<p>at every stage of life, and yet we&rsquo;re very bad</p>
<p>at understanding it and we&rsquo;re relatively poor</p>
<p>at predicting it and our tools are not very powerful.</p>
<p>We can put people in a locked unit,</p>
<p>we can give them care, therapy for a while.</p>
<p>At some point, we release them</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s only so much we can do.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of the most frustrating things,</p>
<p>the suffering that is linked to suicidality.</p>
<p>But it is a decision and it is an action</p>
<p>and if you look at optogenetics,</p>
<p>you should be able to one day sort of understand</p>
<p>the dynamics of such weighty decisions.</p>
<p>The individual causes then, if someone is anhedonic,</p>
<p>if there is no joy in life, that very likely</p>
<p>is addressable by optogenetics.</p>
<p>We know how to turn that dial very robustly in animals.</p>
<p>The motivation to overcome challenges,</p>
<p>that we have some hope of understanding.</p>
<p>Psychic pain, internal negative states,</p>
<p>we have actually a handle on that as well.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a structure in the brain called the habenula</p>
<p>and some linked structures around it</p>
<p>that seems to generate this negative internal state.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s active when a state of acute disappointment,</p>
<p>acute outcomes that go wrong, not as expected.</p>
<p>Moments of unexpected pain.</p>
<p>The habenula is there, it seems,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s active to report on internal negativity</p>
<p>with its action.</p>
<p>And so you could imagine strategies</p>
<p>to target this brain structure</p>
<p>that might have the effect of reducing psychic pain,</p>
<p>reducing the negativity of internal states.</p>
<p>That is a very concrete hope.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s precise, it&rsquo;s anatomical.</p>
<p>Optogenetics has given us all the firm foundation we need</p>
<p>to go after that question.</p>
<p>So I think there is hope.</p>
<p>If you look at the individual causes,</p>
<p>the individual symptoms relating to suicide,</p>
<p>and then it&rsquo;s like a puzzle,</p>
<p>you put together the puzzle pieces.</p>
<p>By the way, I do think my habenula is</p>
<p>very functioning, very actively.</p>
<p>And I wonder if it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>because you can also learn to channel these things, right?</p>
<p>Some of the things we suffer from,</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s degrees of suffering,</p>
<p>can be a source of progress and personal growth</p>
<p>and development and all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>I mean, I, what is it?</p>
<p>Nietzsche suffered from stomach issues.</p>
<p>I wonder if he&rsquo;s written some of those things</p>
<p>if his stomach was all great.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s, I kind of think that</p>
<p>a difficult life in some form,</p>
<p>you can get, you get to choose in some regard</p>
<p>and some of you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>The difficulties you have and the ones you do have,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s nice to use if possible.</p>
<p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s nice to treat,</p>
<p>sometimes it&rsquo;s nice to use.</p>
<p>Well, the way you phrase it, I think you&rsquo;re using it.</p>
<p>I could be wrong, but if you,</p>
<p>you phrased in this semi humorous way about your habenula,</p>
<p>it seems to me that you&rsquo;re using that to good effect.</p>
<p>Now, but one never really knows</p>
<p>what someone else&rsquo;s internal state is.</p>
<p>As I look at you, I don&rsquo;t know the depths of what&rsquo;s going on</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s possible that it&rsquo;s a much harder situation</p>
<p>in there.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s, I actually worry about this a lot.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m extremely self critical,</p>
<p>like in the privacy of my own mind,</p>
<p>which is an interesting thing</p>
<p>when you get to meet the internet</p>
<p>and the internet will tell you you suck.</p>
<p>But for now, now this is what I worry about</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m very paying attention.</p>
<p>For now it&rsquo;s really, I just have this like very negative</p>
<p>voice, but that voice seems to be very useful</p>
<p>for productivity and so I channel it.</p>
<p>I just put it on the table and let that voice like</p>
<p>talk to me, but I&rsquo;m very, I&rsquo;m like monitoring that voice</p>
<p>because looking at Robin Williams, you know,</p>
<p>you get older, your brain changes or like you&rsquo;re,</p>
<p>and then that voice can now all of a sudden grow, right?</p>
<p>And then where you can&rsquo;t control as much,</p>
<p>you have to be very careful with these kinds of things.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re very right about that.</p>
<p>So my negativity, I have this,</p>
<p>I never think I&rsquo;ve done enough is sort of where my</p>
<p>negativity comes from inside.</p>
<p>I never think that I&rsquo;ve met the potential of the moment.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t done, I haven&rsquo;t, you know,</p>
<p>made the most of the opportunities that are available.</p>
<p>Still early, I haven&rsquo;t, you know,</p>
<p>progressed as far as I should.</p>
<p>And exactly as you&rsquo;re saying, that works for a while.</p>
<p>But then what happens as you get later in life</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s less runway to, you know, fix that.</p>
<p>And then maybe then that negative voice is a problem.</p>
<p>But also at that point, the negative voice</p>
<p>starts having more and more of a point.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re being very successful,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s easy to be like, no, okay, well,</p>
<p>like because later in life, you&rsquo;re really literally</p>
<p>just sitting there on a rocking chair doing nothing.</p>
<p>And then it&rsquo;s, or maybe any kind of tragedy happens.</p>
<p>Loss of a loved one, loss of a job,</p>
<p>loss or you get screwed over in some kind of way.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>And then all of a sudden the negative voice</p>
<p>is just you and the negative voice</p>
<p>for days and days and days.</p>
<p>And so I don&rsquo;t know, to go back to your example</p>
<p>of Robin Williams, I don&rsquo;t know what was going on inside him.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know the nature of his internal state.</p>
<p>Was it active psychic pain that?</p>
<p>May I mention, may I interrupt to just say</p>
<p>that Sergei posted an examination of Robin Williams.</p>
<p>His brain tissue suggested that he suffered from quote,</p>
<p>diffuse LEWY, Lewy body dementia, LBD.</p>
<p>Depression is a symptom of LBD and it&rsquo;s not about psychology.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s rooted in urology.</p>
<p>This is words from Sergei.</p>
<p>His brain was falling apart.</p>
<p>Yeah, Lewy body dementia.</p>
<p>This is a very interesting neurological disorder</p>
<p>where among other things, there&rsquo;s neuron death indeed.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve got frank neuron loss.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just a matter of some longstanding psychic pain,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;ve got a progressive loss.</p>
<p>And so clearly you&rsquo;ve got a situation</p>
<p>where he could have finally reached a point</p>
<p>where the balance that he&rsquo;d worked out</p>
<p>between negativity and positivity was disrupted due to loss.</p>
<p>The wrong cells died, the wrong projections were cut.</p>
<p>By the Lewy body dementia.</p>
<p>Certainly dopamine neurons die in Lewy body dementia.</p>
<p>Those are neurons that give rise to much of the feelings</p>
<p>of reward and pleasure that we experience among other roles.</p>
<p>So clearly in his case, there could have been</p>
<p>a very concrete cellular neurological issue</p>
<p>that was progressive and pushed him to that point.</p>
<p>But were you about to make a point about broader</p>
<p>that if there is not a neurological degeneration?</p>
<p>Yeah, so in his case, not knowing that,</p>
<p>it could have been simply that,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say he had an internal psychic pain state</p>
<p>and he was in sort of a compensated mode</p>
<p>for much of his life, able to generate enough joy</p>
<p>from his comedy and his social interactions.</p>
<p>But eventually later in life, those things drop away,</p>
<p>the balance shifts.</p>
<p>You get tired of fighting the pain for that long.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve got this time dependent non stationarity</p>
<p>that happens and then the same symptom</p>
<p>becomes no longer tolerable in the end.</p>
<p>What is autism?</p>
<p>What do we know about autism?</p>
<p>Human beings exist on a spectrum of how social we can be.</p>
<p>And this is pretty interesting actually, scientifically,</p>
<p>but also very important clinically.</p>
<p>There are hyper social states where people</p>
<p>are almost too social.</p>
<p>There are chromosomal deletion states</p>
<p>where people have instant affinity and bonding</p>
<p>and rich deep seeming connections with people, very verbal.</p>
<p>On the other end, people with autism spectrum disorder</p>
<p>are not able to keep up with social interactions</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a spectrum.</p>
<p>Some have mild to moderate difficulties.</p>
<p>They may have inability to understand</p>
<p>what the next thing to do in a social situation is,</p>
<p>but may have perfectly good language abilities.</p>
<p>And as you progress further along the spectrum,</p>
<p>that gets more and more severe</p>
<p>so they can&rsquo;t make eye contact because it&rsquo;s too overwhelming</p>
<p>to think about what has to be done next</p>
<p>if a person looks in a particular way.</p>
<p>And then as you go farther,</p>
<p>then language and social communication themselves break down</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s no reciprocity, there&rsquo;s no shared enjoyment.</p>
<p>And that this gets very hard then</p>
<p>as you get to this far end of the spectrum</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s really an absence of social cognition at all</p>
<p>and social bonding.</p>
<p>So why does this exist?</p>
<p>What is it?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very genetic.</p>
<p>As I mentioned, it&rsquo;s one of the top three or four</p>
<p>most biological in the sense of most genetically determined</p>
<p>of the psychiatric illnesses.</p>
<p>It does have these interesting positive correlations,</p>
<p>slight positive correlations</p>
<p>with intelligence and education.</p>
<p>And the reason for that</p>
<p>is kind of interesting to think about.</p>
<p>Is there something good about it?</p>
<p>Just like, or at least with at least part of the spectrum,</p>
<p>is there something good about it?</p>
<p>Just as we were talking about for depression,</p>
<p>as you could say for mania,</p>
<p>as you could say for schizophrenia.</p>
<p>And here it&rsquo;s kind of interesting</p>
<p>to think about the underlying science</p>
<p>of what it means to be good at a social interaction.</p>
<p>Someone who&rsquo;s very good at a social interaction</p>
<p>is incredibly good at dealing</p>
<p>with unpredictable information,</p>
<p>is able to handle this torrent of information</p>
<p>coming through rapidly changing</p>
<p>model of the other person and of the interaction</p>
<p>and their model of you, your model of them.</p>
<p>With each word that changes,</p>
<p>with each new bit of information</p>
<p>that comes in through the conversation,</p>
<p>each bit of body language, all this is rapidly changing.</p>
<p>And some people are able to keep up</p>
<p>with that firehose of information perfectly well.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s a special brain state to be in.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s working with unpredictability.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the only way that can be done</p>
<p>is most likely by constantly running models</p>
<p>of what the other person might be about to say.</p>
<p>So you can&rsquo;t stop and think, oh, what did that word mean?</p>
<p>What did that shift in eye contact mean?</p>
<p>What do they mean together?</p>
<p>There has to be some advanced work going on</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re predicting what&rsquo;s going on</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re to keep up with a rich</p>
<p>and fast social interaction.</p>
<p>Now, on the flip side, there are brain states</p>
<p>that maybe don&rsquo;t have to work so fast</p>
<p>but that are extremely important still.</p>
<p>Dealing with something that&rsquo;s not moving</p>
<p>or that&rsquo;s predictable, still complex,</p>
<p>like mathematical proof or a very complex arrangement</p>
<p>of geometrical shapes, a large number</p>
<p>of individual nonmoving things.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s possibly a way of being that&rsquo;s particularly good</p>
<p>at dealing with these static, unmoving,</p>
<p>or predictable situations and less so</p>
<p>with these rapidly changing social situations.</p>
<p>And so the way I conceptualize autism</p>
<p>is these are people whose brains are not so good</p>
<p>with the high bit rate, unpredictable information,</p>
<p>but may be quite good at given enough time,</p>
<p>given the grace to work with the system,</p>
<p>to look at it from different angles,</p>
<p>to take different perspectives with a confidence</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s not changing in between perspectives.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a brain state that&rsquo;s valuable.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s something that has probably contributed</p>
<p>to a lot of the success of the human family,</p>
<p>being able to design something,</p>
<p>being able to consider all the different contributions</p>
<p>to a static, predictable system.</p>
<p>So autism, in a sense, is a spectrum</p>
<p>that has identifiable characteristics</p>
<p>about the way people deal with dynamic information,</p>
<p>often expressed itself as like social dynamic information.</p>
<p>But you critically, your use of the word often there</p>
<p>is really, I think, smart,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not just social interaction</p>
<p>that is a challenge in autism.</p>
<p>And so many people conceptualize it purely</p>
<p>as a social dysfunction disorder.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s really any unpredictable information</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a problem, that&rsquo;s a challenge</p>
<p>for people on the spectrum.</p>
<p>They react very negatively to unexpected sounds,</p>
<p>even if not social sounds, unexpected lights,</p>
<p>unexpected touches, and so it&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>unpredictable information that is, in my view,</p>
<p>the core problem with the processing in autism,</p>
<p>not just social.</p>
<p>Social just shows up because it&rsquo;s so unpredictable.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s so interesting.</p>
<p>I mean, I try to not to think about that stuff.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m afraid of thinking about disorders</p>
<p>and things like that because just like I don&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>sort of economics or game theory,</p>
<p>I want to be careful with it because it,</p>
<p>whenever you have a category or a model,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s too easy to just, for everything,</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s the OCD thing.</p>
<p>I like models too much.</p>
<p>I like categories too much.</p>
<p>The moment you acknowledge yourself,</p>
<p>well, I have an eating disorder, for example,</p>
<p>or something like that, as opposed to just being a,</p>
<p>well, I&rsquo;ll just leave it at that</p>
<p>from my own critical understanding of myself.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just say I don&rsquo;t know how to moderate eating fruit.</p>
<p>People make fun of me.</p>
<p>They think all fruit is healthy.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how to moderate anything,</p>
<p>but even fruit, apples and cherries, is a nightmare.</p>
<p>Anyway, that&rsquo;s such a psychiatrist thing to say.</p>
<p>Very interesting.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s characteristics and it&rsquo;s interesting</p>
<p>to think about, like for example,</p>
<p>I have trouble making eye contact,</p>
<p>but I actually, as you said it now,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not that I&rsquo;m shy at all in that sense.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s literally, I&rsquo;m getting way too much information</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s distracting me.</p>
<p>Like I need to just close my eyes so I can,</p>
<p>like all the things that people seem to be able to do</p>
<p>in parallel, it&rsquo;s just, you just asked me a question.</p>
<p>For me to think about the answer to that question,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t have all this cool, rich visual information</p>
<p>coming my way.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s literally, because I often close my eyes to think.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not because I&rsquo;m afraid of something, whatever.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like too much information happening here.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s a beautiful description.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s amazing that that is how you experience</p>
<p>the eye contact aspect.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s, I mean, you&rsquo;ve articulated</p>
<p>what captures it for so many people,</p>
<p>which is that it&rsquo;s overwhelming.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just too much information just coming in</p>
<p>through the eyes and to keep up with it,</p>
<p>to know you&rsquo;re gonna be expected to keep up with it,</p>
<p>first of all, so there&rsquo;s that aspect.</p>
<p>You know, you&rsquo;ve learned socially</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s gonna be an expectation</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re making eye contact.</p>
<p>People are gonna think you&rsquo;re keeping up with it,</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t want to because you wanna focus</p>
<p>on other things and make progress in other dimensions.</p>
<p>Yeah, and so then there&rsquo;s a strong desire</p>
<p>to look away or to close the eyes</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s overwhelming, it&rsquo;s a distraction,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s gonna cause errors of understanding.</p>
<p>And of course, our eyes, that&rsquo;s part,</p>
<p>the way we use our eyes is part of the human communication,</p>
<p>so you have to kind of be aware of that,</p>
<p>of that element of it.</p>
<p>So yeah, I mean, but it&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>You should be aware of your own self</p>
<p>in those little characteristics,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s classified on some aspect</p>
<p>of the autism spectrum or just in general,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s eating, whether it&rsquo;s depression,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s even like schizophrenia</p>
<p>that I hope we get a chance to talk to a little bit.</p>
<p>Yeah, but those things are all made up</p>
<p>of different symptoms and characteristics,</p>
<p>and use them as a superpower, I suppose,</p>
<p>is the best we can hope for in mild cases, I guess.</p>
<p>I do think both brain states can&rsquo;t coexist</p>
<p>at the same time.</p>
<p>The way of dealing with something unpredictable</p>
<p>and dealing with something predictable,</p>
<p>those are different ways of being,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s a huge opportunity for very creative</p>
<p>model building in theoretical neuroscience</p>
<p>and linking that to these data streams</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re getting across the brain that we talked about earlier,</p>
<p>these immense data sets of activity across the brain.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s where I think there could be</p>
<p>a real convergence of theoreticians and experimentalists</p>
<p>to say, okay, given what we know about wiring of the brain,</p>
<p>here is what the brain state is likely to be</p>
<p>that deals well with unpredictable information,</p>
<p>and here&rsquo;s the brain state</p>
<p>that deals with predictable information.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re incompatible, at least at the same time.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s why you&rsquo;ve gotta be able to detect</p>
<p>which state you should be in.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how you could switch between them.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the kind of cells that you would predict,</p>
<p>almost like predicting the Higgs boson.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the kind of circuitry that I would predict</p>
<p>should govern the switching,</p>
<p>or might make one state too sticky, too hard to get out of.</p>
<p>That is a huge opportunity for an interaction</p>
<p>from the theoretical and experimental side together.</p>
<p>Make one state too sticky.</p>
<p>The sort of measure the stickiness of the state</p>
<p>and how to lessen the stickiness.</p>
<p>Get some oil in the machine.</p>
<p>Yes, yeah, what would predict the kind of oil</p>
<p>that would work well.</p>
<p>What, in your practice, is treatment or advice</p>
<p>for the people on the autism spectrum?</p>
<p>So right now, there&rsquo;s no real medical treatment.</p>
<p>There are behavioral treatments</p>
<p>that are most effective early in life.</p>
<p>They make sure people don&rsquo;t fall too far behind.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re not interacting socially,</p>
<p>you create this vicious cycle</p>
<p>where you fall farther and farther behind</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re not interacting.</p>
<p>And these therapies which are applied early in life,</p>
<p>therapists work with the kids,</p>
<p>train them to deal with these things</p>
<p>that otherwise would be aversive to them,</p>
<p>teach them how to predict things and interact,</p>
<p>and that has a big effect.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s behavioral therapy.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no medicine that works.</p>
<p>There are ways of reducing individual symptoms though</p>
<p>that sometimes come along with autism</p>
<p>and those do respond to medications.</p>
<p>So you can, one thing, very often,</p>
<p>my patients with autism are very anxious</p>
<p>because they live in a world</p>
<p>that they have a really hard time</p>
<p>predicting what&rsquo;s gonna happen.</p>
<p>And so they find, and some of these are high functioning,</p>
<p>Silicon Valley types who they may make great livings</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re very unhappy because they&rsquo;re on the spectrum.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t understand how social interactions really work.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re very anxiety provoking</p>
<p>because they don&rsquo;t know what to say.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t have any clue how anybody else knows what to say.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re constantly worried they&rsquo;re gonna say something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s completely inappropriate</p>
<p>and so they&rsquo;re very anxious.</p>
<p>And I can treat their anxiety.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t touch the autism per se</p>
<p>but I can help them with their anxiety.</p>
<p>What I just talked about, eye contact.</p>
<p>I am richly, even with eyes closed</p>
<p>and all those kinds of things,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m richly experiencing the world.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not like you&rsquo;re afraid of the world</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re not able, I don&rsquo;t know what to do.</p>
<p>No, I know everything.</p>
<p>In fact, I know way too much.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so many cool options.</p>
<p>Like at any one moment, there&rsquo;s all the stuff happening</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s all beautiful.</p>
<p>And at any one moment, you can do anything you want.</p>
<p>You can take off your clothes.</p>
<p>You can punch that guy over there.</p>
<p>You can run away.</p>
<p>You can go in for a hug.</p>
<p>You can say something profound and deep</p>
<p>or you can say something generic</p>
<p>or you can do so many things you can say.</p>
<p>And then it&rsquo;ll go, it&rsquo;ll unravel in all these kinds of ways</p>
<p>and this moment could be completely life changing</p>
<p>or it can be mundane and meaningless.</p>
<p>And all of those options are before you at any one moment.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s amazing and overwhelming</p>
<p>if you allow yourself to think about it,</p>
<p>which whatever, exactly.</p>
<p>Like, well, I&rsquo;m fortunate with chess,</p>
<p>you have a few set options.</p>
<p>Two dimensional, at least dimensional is constraints.</p>
<p>There is unlimited possibilities</p>
<p>and unlimited beautiful things happening all around you.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s a kind of sense</p>
<p>that somehow you&rsquo;re limited in the places of,</p>
<p>in the way you can see the world</p>
<p>and how you can interact with that world.</p>
<p>I am overwhelmed by the lack of limit.</p>
<p>That all of us should be, have you looked around?</p>
<p>You can do whatever the hell you want.</p>
<p>Nobody will remember you anyway.</p>
<p>All of us will be dead one day.</p>
<p>You could do anything.</p>
<p>You can, I don&rsquo;t know, you can get naked</p>
<p>and run around the city,</p>
<p>as long as you&rsquo;re not hurting anybody,</p>
<p>and it doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s Austin, anyway.</p>
<p>Austin, yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>Seems like a to do item for anybody living in Austin,</p>
<p>for sure.</p>
<p>But the spectrum is an interesting concept</p>
<p>because that is, when I say,</p>
<p>when I refer to the spectrum,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m actually referring to, it&rsquo;s a precise clinical term,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re right, it&rsquo;s been coopted more broadly</p>
<p>and it is widely used and it can be</p>
<p>an unfair categorization of someone</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s socially and occupationally very healthy.</p>
<p>And that is critical</p>
<p>because we don&rsquo;t define a disorder</p>
<p>unless there&rsquo;s social or occupational dysfunction.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter what the symptoms are.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had patients who are pleasantly hallucinating,</p>
<p>so frankly, psychotic, but doesn&rsquo;t affect their lives,</p>
<p>so I don&rsquo;t give that person a diagnosis</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s not social or occupational dysfunction.</p>
<p>Same with anything on this,</p>
<p>any of the diverse symptoms of autism spectrum disorder.</p>
<p>If someone has them,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re successful socially and occupationally,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t say that there&rsquo;s a disorder.</p>
<p>But then you&rsquo;re right, that the concept of the spectrum</p>
<p>does become a useful pigeonholing device,</p>
<p>which is maybe not the best thing.</p>
<p>Yeah, and the eye contact is an interesting one,</p>
<p>is an interesting one.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m torn on it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m torn about the usefulness of eye contact</p>
<p>because people kind of make fun of it,</p>
<p>but let me just say one thing about eye contact</p>
<p>and about life in general.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s okay to be weird,</p>
<p>but like some people, when you have your eyes closed</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s that weird, what is happening to this creature?</p>
<p>Like you see a weird creature on the side of the road.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>And you wanna, I mean, the weird stuff,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna go back to Robin Williams with the,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the good stuff, right?</p>
<p>He has that whole speech about him and his wife</p>
<p>and what he loves all the little peculiarities,</p>
<p>all the weird stuff.</p>
<p>And that, like let those flourish.</p>
<p>Let those, like celebrate those in yourself</p>
<p>and not in some kind of woke way,</p>
<p>but in some like very human way.</p>
<p>This is what makes us, this is the weirdness.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m 100% on board with that.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think, you know, people who are happy</p>
<p>and who have people in their lives who are happy with them,</p>
<p>these are, I think, let the weirdness flourish.</p>
<p>Let the, all the different ways members</p>
<p>of the human family can be different.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see them all.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one of our, that&rsquo;s one of the joys of being alive</p>
<p>is seeing all the ways we can be human.</p>
<p>And I think about it all the time.</p>
<p>Why do we have all these ways of being human?</p>
<p>And even within one individual,</p>
<p>you go through phases of life</p>
<p>where you express different sides of your way of being,</p>
<p>which is also a pretty fun opportunity, right?</p>
<p>You can go through phases where you&rsquo;re in one mode</p>
<p>and phases when you&rsquo;re in another mode.</p>
<p>And let that, you know, just let that flourish too.</p>
<p>Let the ways that you can be you vary as well.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s important for people to explore.</p>
<p>And I should, like, as if you can address the internet,</p>
<p>but I would like to sort of ask the internet</p>
<p>to celebrate the weirdness of people.</p>
<p>Like, that&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s the Robin Williams,</p>
<p>people call these imperfections,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re not, that&rsquo;s the good stuff.</p>
<p>For any one individual person,</p>
<p>find the weird stuff and celebrate it,</p>
<p>as opposed to what the internet often does,</p>
<p>which is find the weird stuff and criticize it.</p>
<p>Because when you criticize the weird stuff,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re creating conformity, which is another human thing.</p>
<p>But that conformity creates a boring world.</p>
<p>You want the weird, you want the crazy.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what fun is made of.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the foundation of humor</p>
<p>and all of the ways in which we deal</p>
<p>with the suffering in the world,</p>
<p>with the injustices in the world,</p>
<p>is like this like huge variety of weird.</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what, at the depth of psychiatry,</p>
<p>is like you wanna acknowledge the weird,</p>
<p>celebrate the weird, like step around it</p>
<p>to find the particular aspects of weird</p>
<p>that are debilitating, like you said.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re somehow negatively affecting your ability</p>
<p>to function in the world,</p>
<p>as opposed to trying to shut it all down.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Well, on that topic, I mean,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to talk to you about schizophrenia.</p>
<p>What is schizophrenia?</p>
<p>From your research and from your general understanding,</p>
<p>and what is the full landscape of suffering</p>
<p>and wisdom that schizophrenia explores?</p>
<p>Schizophrenia is a state where</p>
<p>there is a break from reality.</p>
<p>And so this can show up, as we call them,</p>
<p>the positive symptoms of schizophrenia.</p>
<p>These include hallucinations,</p>
<p>hearing something or seeing something that&rsquo;s not there,</p>
<p>usually auditory hallucinations.</p>
<p>Paranoia, people can have complex fears.</p>
<p>Delusions, which we call fixed false beliefs,</p>
<p>people get an extremely unshakable</p>
<p>but completely implausible idea about something.</p>
<p>Sometimes it relates to themself, sometimes to the world.</p>
<p>These we call the positive symptoms,</p>
<p>break from reality as we know it.</p>
<p>Then there are the negative symptoms that come with it,</p>
<p>and these are progressive.</p>
<p>These are flattening of emotion, as we call it,</p>
<p>so starting to express less and less positive emotion,</p>
<p>ending more in a neutral or flat state.</p>
<p>Thought disorder, inability to work with complex patterns</p>
<p>of planning or thinking, so you can&rsquo;t make plans,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d have poor working memory,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t keep track of where you were in a conversation,</p>
<p>in a sequence of actions.</p>
<p>So poor and impaired working with the thoughts of oneself</p>
<p>and then these positive symptoms of break from reality.</p>
<p>Okay, now why do these come together?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the neurobiology of it?</p>
<p>Again, we don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Schizophrenia, extremely genetically determined.</p>
<p>If you look at the numbers,</p>
<p>could be upwards of 80% genetically determined.</p>
<p>1% of the human population around the world,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s universal, okay?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not confined to any one culture,</p>
<p>not even really biased in one culture or another,</p>
<p>about 1% around the world.</p>
<p>And has this progressive quality to it, untreated,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s very interesting.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a break that happens, we call it first break,</p>
<p>when someone experiences their first disruption of reality,</p>
<p>they can have a completely typical life up until that point.</p>
<p>So you might have a, and I&rsquo;ve seen just heartbreaking cases</p>
<p>of like this in the Stanford emergency room</p>
<p>where a kid has come there,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s been extremely high functioning in that sense</p>
<p>of academic achievement and athletic and interpersonal,</p>
<p>and then comes to college.</p>
<p>Usually in men, it&rsquo;s around 18, 19 when the first break</p>
<p>happens, some terrifying paranoia hits</p>
<p>or some auditory hallucinations start.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re getting screamed at by a voice in their head.</p>
<p>So devastating.</p>
<p>With women, comes on also often a little later,</p>
<p>sometimes in the 20s, and it can be progressive.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s not treated, it just progresses and progresses.</p>
<p>The voices become overwhelming, the delusions</p>
<p>and paranoia extend and expand.</p>
<p>The thought, the negative symptoms particularly</p>
<p>become more and more severe.</p>
<p>So one can&rsquo;t even maintain thoughts</p>
<p>in any sort of ordered fashion.</p>
<p>And then eventually, it can be fatal,</p>
<p>it can lead to suicide, it can lead to erratic behavior</p>
<p>that leads to accidents.</p>
<p>Now, it can be treated.</p>
<p>There are medications that help, fortunately.</p>
<p>They have side effects, so they&rsquo;re not perfect.</p>
<p>You can have movement problems and actually a whole host</p>
<p>of different side effects that come from the medications.</p>
<p>But we can help people now with schizophrenia</p>
<p>very, very significantly.</p>
<p>But the amazing thing, and this is emblematic</p>
<p>of where psychiatry stands, we don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>the deep understanding, just like with depression,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t have that heart as a pump level of understanding</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;d like to have with schizophrenia,</p>
<p>despite it being so biological, so genetic in its nature.</p>
<p>So is there a way to return to the other side</p>
<p>of the first break?</p>
<p>So when you have a break with reality,</p>
<p>is there a way to kind of stitch it together?</p>
<p>So some people, that works, but we don&rsquo;t really know how.</p>
<p>So medications, antipsychotic medications, we call them,</p>
<p>they block a particular neurotransmitter receptor</p>
<p>called the serotonin 2A receptor,</p>
<p>and they modulate dopamine as well</p>
<p>and other neurotransmitters.</p>
<p>These can take someone who&rsquo;s actively hallucinating,</p>
<p>actively paranoid, put them back in a completely normal</p>
<p>state, and some people stay that way indefinitely.</p>
<p>So you can bring people back from that,</p>
<p>back to the other side, have it stitched together.</p>
<p>More typically, you&rsquo;ll end up in some intermediate state</p>
<p>where symptoms are reduced powerfully,</p>
<p>but there might be still something there</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve got a drop down in functioning</p>
<p>that may be persistent for a while.</p>
<p>But concepts, what physically is going on?</p>
<p>One idea is that it&rsquo;s communication within the brain.</p>
<p>One part of the brain is not able to tell</p>
<p>other parts of the brain what it&rsquo;s doing.</p>
<p>And so the auditory hallucinations</p>
<p>are very interesting in this regard.</p>
<p>They often have this conversational,</p>
<p>inner monologue like quality.</p>
<p>As we&rsquo;re walking along the street,</p>
<p>we may have an inner monologue,</p>
<p>thoughts about what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>If we see somebody we don&rsquo;t like,</p>
<p>we may have a thought,</p>
<p>wish somebody would punch that guy, something like that,</p>
<p>or maybe I should punch that guy.</p>
<p>But these are so far below where we would ever act</p>
<p>or even think of acting,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re just things that come up.</p>
<p>And in people with schizophrenia,</p>
<p>those inner thoughts, that inner monologue,</p>
<p>is not recognized as the inner monologue of the self.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s perceived as something coming from the outside</p>
<p>or from inside, but from another entity.</p>
<p>Another, oh, another, I thought you meant</p>
<p>like another room inside the same building.</p>
<p>Another room inside there, yeah.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s, so it could be conceptualized</p>
<p>as a communication within the brain problem,</p>
<p>notifying another part of the brain what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s some evidence consistent with that.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you can help with this,</p>
<p>but I sometimes, so I&rsquo;ve been talking</p>
<p>to quite a few homeless folks recently,</p>
<p>just, so what I do is I hang out at night</p>
<p>and talk to interesting people.</p>
<p>And some of them, and I&rsquo;ve known people in the past</p>
<p>who suffer from schizophrenia,</p>
<p>and some of them, like self, will describe</p>
<p>as that as something they suffer from.</p>
<p>And they seem to understand something deeply</p>
<p>about this world.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s correlated</p>
<p>or maybe it&rsquo;s another aspect of like depression,</p>
<p>all those things that I&rsquo;ve encountered in my own life</p>
<p>is maybe just the struggle and the suffering</p>
<p>has taken you through a life</p>
<p>where you think deeply about life.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s like self reflection</p>
<p>that society forces on you</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a disorder of some kind.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting, I guess my only sort</p>
<p>of anecdotal observation is people who suffer</p>
<p>from schizophrenia seem to be very interesting</p>
<p>and very thoughtful in a nonlinear way about the world.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve noticed that it&rsquo;s not always positive.</p>
<p>There are unusual ways they view the world.</p>
<p>It was, but it&rsquo;s always interesting.</p>
<p>That could be conspiratorial thinking too.</p>
<p>Like, but like the theories they have</p>
<p>about the way the world functions,</p>
<p>often very well read, which is also interesting</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re almost like looking</p>
<p>for helpful answers from somewhere.</p>
<p>Absolutely there.</p>
<p>And so they&rsquo;re, they might be citing</p>
<p>some very interesting literature</p>
<p>and then using that to, there&rsquo;s a stickiness</p>
<p>in their mind to different models of the world</p>
<p>and trying to make sense of that world.</p>
<p>And those models could include conspiracy theories.</p>
<p>Yeah, they&rsquo;re very attuned to complexity</p>
<p>and they come up with unlikely explanations,</p>
<p>which is one of the things that makes them,</p>
<p>it makes it hard for them to function in the world</p>
<p>is how unlikely their explanations are.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re right, there&rsquo;s a depth of consideration</p>
<p>of the complexity of the world and a concern about it</p>
<p>and a work, an impulse to work to understand it</p>
<p>that is actually quite refreshing.</p>
<p>But the first case in the medical literature,</p>
<p>there was a classical schizophrenia.</p>
<p>There was a patient named James Tilly Matthews</p>
<p>who had this, he sketched out for his doctor</p>
<p>the experiences he was sensing</p>
<p>and he drew himself as a cowering figure</p>
<p>on the ground controlled by a loom,</p>
<p>a weaving device that was sending threads,</p>
<p>long threads, projections across space</p>
<p>from the loom to him, to his arms and to his body</p>
<p>and controlling him from afar.</p>
<p>And he called this the air loom, a loom in the air.</p>
<p>And it was such an evocative thing</p>
<p>because this was the start of the Industrial Revolution</p>
<p>or mid and it was where really industrial strength,</p>
<p>looms and weaving devices were really kind of the emblematic</p>
<p>of the most complex, powerful technological achievements</p>
<p>of the time and so that was the explanation available</p>
<p>to him to explain how his body was seemingly moved</p>
<p>without his volition and these days, of course,</p>
<p>people with schizophrenia will have more technology</p>
<p>appropriate interpretations, they&rsquo;ll have delusions</p>
<p>of satellite or alien control or beamed information,</p>
<p>very, very common to have this delusion</p>
<p>of a government agency sending electromagnetic</p>
<p>or radio frequency information to control their limbs.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s the same thing, whether it&rsquo;s a thread</p>
<p>from an Industrial Revolution loom</p>
<p>or RF radiation, it&rsquo;s the same thing just adapted</p>
<p>to the moment explaining, trying to explain</p>
<p>the world they live in and their relationship to the world.</p>
<p>But unconstrained by sort of the thing</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s socially acceptable,</p>
<p>which is both refreshing and dangerous.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I wrote down a question.</p>
<p>Why do we cry?</p>
<p>Are tears a window to some depths</p>
<p>that we ourselves don&rsquo;t know?</p>
<p>I almost wanna make fun of myself for that question,</p>
<p>but you do talk seriously about crying in the book.</p>
<p>In fact, the whole first chapter really tussles</p>
<p>with crying as why do we do it, what does it mean,</p>
<p>why is it involuntary?</p>
<p>It seems like a weakness, right?</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s so involuntary and it&rsquo;s reflecting</p>
<p>something true and inside.</p>
<p>At the level of the individual,</p>
<p>that seems like a problem, right?</p>
<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t it be better if we could control it,</p>
<p>if we could not show that emotion when it&rsquo;s not useful,</p>
<p>show it when it&rsquo;s useful?</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not, it&rsquo;s largely involuntary.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s a value to it, I think,</p>
<p>as an honest reporter of a need,</p>
<p>of hope and frailty at the same time.</p>
<p>I am a human being, there&rsquo;s a frailty to myself</p>
<p>or my situation where I need social help,</p>
<p>I need help from my community.</p>
<p>I have hope that that is possible,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m not enough for myself, I need the community.</p>
<p>That I think is what the social signal of crying is.</p>
<p>Now people have studied crying, it&rsquo;s an extreme,</p>
<p>you can quantify the extent to which the presence of tears</p>
<p>on a face triggers reactions in onlookers.</p>
<p>And you can show the same face in the presence</p>
<p>or absence of tears and show that to people</p>
<p>under quantifiable and rigorous psychological conditions.</p>
<p>And tears are much more powerful at stirring</p>
<p>the desire to help in viewers</p>
<p>than any other facial feature.</p>
<p>Which is pretty interesting that it&rsquo;s the honest one</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s also the most powerful, right?</p>
<p>It kind of indicates there&rsquo;s a certain logic</p>
<p>to our design as social beings</p>
<p>that we have an honest report.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s hard to control.</p>
<p>But is it well understood how that connects</p>
<p>to the internal state of emotion?</p>
<p>Yeah, there are long range projections that come,</p>
<p>so where is crying generated?</p>
<p>This is the confusing thing about it.</p>
<p>So that we have a little tear duct, the lacrimal gland</p>
<p>that leads to the release of fluid,</p>
<p>it ejects fluid and it comes out.</p>
<p>And those of course, that whole system was designed</p>
<p>to keep the eye clean, to wash out particulate irritants.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a long standing, as long as we&rsquo;ve had eyes</p>
<p>and have been out of the water in our evolution,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve needed this sort of thing.</p>
<p>So long standing biological structure,</p>
<p>recently co opted it seems by our evolution</p>
<p>as social primates.</p>
<p>Now, how could that happen?</p>
<p>Well, the lacrimal gland is controlled by structures</p>
<p>in the pons, which is a structure deep in our,</p>
<p>just above our neck, between our neck and our head.</p>
<p>And reflecting its ancient origin, right?</p>
<p>As you go farther down toward the spinal cord,</p>
<p>these are the more basic early evolved structures.</p>
<p>And in the pons, that&rsquo;s where breathing is controlled,</p>
<p>tear duct contraction.</p>
<p>And what we found and with optogenetics,</p>
<p>we helped sort this out,</p>
<p>there are long range projections</p>
<p>from fear and anxiety regions in the forebrain</p>
<p>that project all the way to the pons</p>
<p>in and around those areas.</p>
<p>The reason those are there,</p>
<p>we think is to regulate the respiratory rate changes,</p>
<p>the breathing changes of fear and anxiety.</p>
<p>So we know when we&rsquo;re in a state of fear and anxiety,</p>
<p>we need, we cope better if we have elevated heart rate,</p>
<p>elevated respiratory rate, more blood pumping around,</p>
<p>more oxygenated blood,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re ready to meet the threat if it happens.</p>
<p>All those cells are down there in the pons too,</p>
<p>right next to the lacrimal duct, the tear gland neurons.</p>
<p>And so almost certainly this fear anxiety induced crying</p>
<p>arose from a very slightly misdirected long range projection</p>
<p>that was there to regulate breathing.</p>
<p>And a little twist, just a little misdirection,</p>
<p>a little missing of one sign post to stop here,</p>
<p>going on a little farther,</p>
<p>getting to the lacrimal gland neurons gave us crying.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, and we just have it,</p>
<p>that peculiar sort of structure, neuronal structure</p>
<p>that resulted in that, that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re stuck with.</p>
<p>And that ends up being, in terms of social interaction,</p>
<p>one of the more important, authentic,</p>
<p>involuntary displays of interstate.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>And social communication.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, is there other stuff like that?</p>
<p>I mean, do you, yeah, I mean, the human face is fascinating</p>
<p>as a display of emotion, as a display of truth and lying</p>
<p>and all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>I personally, I mean, we&rsquo;re all, I suppose,</p>
<p>have different sensors that are sensitive</p>
<p>to certain aspects of the human face.</p>
<p>But to me, it seems like the eyes</p>
<p>are really important communication or something.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;ve talked to a few sort of girls</p>
<p>about like Botox and stuff like that.</p>
<p>And it always bothers me when,</p>
<p>I guess guys can do this too,</p>
<p>but like when women speak negatively</p>
<p>of, I guess you can call them wrinkles,</p>
<p>at the tips of an eye.</p>
<p>But like to me, when you smile, when you wink,</p>
<p>not wink, but like narrow the eyes,</p>
<p>something is communicated and those,</p>
<p>that stuff is really useful, the human face.</p>
<p>And when it&rsquo;s gone, something is missing.</p>
<p>And a lot of little stuff, it feels like it really,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost involuntary, I guess,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s harder to describe as the presence</p>
<p>or absence of tears.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like something about this person,</p>
<p>you can tell they&rsquo;re not bullshitting you.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>And so that was what made, presumably,</p>
<p>that tear recruitment so powerful,</p>
<p>is it just landed in this very high value real estate</p>
<p>for social communication.</p>
<p>If it had gone to, you know,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of neurons in the pons</p>
<p>that control movement of large muscles elsewhere,</p>
<p>that would have been much less effective</p>
<p>as a social signal than something around the eye.</p>
<p>So it was, however that little misdirection happened,</p>
<p>it landed in a great area for social communication.</p>
<p>And because it was coming from the fear and anxiety circuits</p>
<p>that regulate that necessary involuntary change</p>
<p>in heart rate and respiratory rate,</p>
<p>it also was involuntary and that became valuable</p>
<p>as a truth signal, as social beings.</p>
<p>So very interesting when you think about</p>
<p>the origins of the human family,</p>
<p>the origins of social structures</p>
<p>and our ability and need to call for help</p>
<p>when there&rsquo;s hope, but need at the same time.</p>
<p>What is consciousness, Carl?</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re actually using techniques.</p>
<p>I mean, even putting psychiatry aside,</p>
<p>just looking at optogenetics,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re trying to understand some of these deep aspects</p>
<p>of the human mind.</p>
<p>And maybe this is a good time to return to a question</p>
<p>you mentioned you might have an opinion on</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s such a thing as a theory of everything</p>
<p>for the human mind.</p>
<p>Because surely answering of what is consciousness</p>
<p>is as, well, that&rsquo;s not sure.</p>
<p>But it seems like it&rsquo;s a fundamental part</p>
<p>of the human experience in the human mind</p>
<p>and solving that question will result in solving</p>
<p>the bigger thing about the human mind.</p>
<p>The flip side could be consciousness</p>
<p>is just the few neurons that are generating</p>
<p>some useful thing that make us,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like the sense of self</p>
<p>that you talked about in the mice.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s a subset of those cells</p>
<p>that are just creating a richer sense of self</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>So this is a great question.</p>
<p>All neuroscientists think about this</p>
<p>and a lot of non neuroscientists too.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the reason a lot of people came to the study</p>
<p>of the brain is to think about consciousness</p>
<p>and not just being awake or alert</p>
<p>but really what&rsquo;s sometimes called</p>
<p>the hard problem of consciousness</p>
<p>which is what is that nature of that inner</p>
<p>subjective sense we have?</p>
<p>Not just information processing</p>
<p>but feeling something about the information.</p>
<p>What is that inner state of subjectivity physically?</p>
<p>What is it?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s called the hard problem of consciousness</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not a extremely well defined question.</p>
<p>Everybody has sort of a sense of what it means</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s such a hard problem</p>
<p>because you run into paradoxes quite quickly</p>
<p>the more you think about it</p>
<p>and that is exciting also</p>
<p>because it makes us think</p>
<p>actually there&rsquo;s some fundamental,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a big thing that we&rsquo;re missing.</p>
<p>The brain is not just a collection of little tricks.</p>
<p>There is a big, big concept.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s your sense of the big</p>
<p>because a flip side could be with optogenetics.</p>
<p>You can, there&rsquo;s an engineering question.</p>
<p>Can you turn consciousness on and off like a light switch?</p>
<p>Okay, so here&rsquo;s where exactly consciousness</p>
<p>frames the problem extremely well</p>
<p>and it frames it the following way.</p>
<p>So I told you earlier that we can stimulate</p>
<p>20 or 25 cells in the visual cortex of a mouse</p>
<p>and we can make it behave and we can make its brain act</p>
<p>as if it&rsquo;s seeing something that isn&rsquo;t there.</p>
<p>We have that level of control now.</p>
<p>We can pick out 25 neurons, play in activity</p>
<p>and both behavior and in the brain,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s as if it&rsquo;s seeing something specific.</p>
<p>Okay, now let&rsquo;s do a thought experiment,</p>
<p>you know, a Gedanken experiment and let&rsquo;s play this out.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say we could do the same thing</p>
<p>for every single neuron in the brain of a human being.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say we had total control</p>
<p>and I could do something like,</p>
<p>I could show you a rich deep color red</p>
<p>and you could look at it and you would be aware</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s red, but also you might have some feelings</p>
<p>about it, something would be stirred in you,</p>
<p>some subjective sense as you looked at that rich color red</p>
<p>and then I would take away the visual stimulus</p>
<p>and I would, in this thought experiment,</p>
<p>I would, using some hyperoptogenetics,</p>
<p>I would play in exactly the same pattern of activity</p>
<p>in every cell in your brain for as long as was needed,</p>
<p>whatever, 15 seconds, something like that,</p>
<p>that exactly matched what was going on</p>
<p>when you were feeling that inner subjective sense.</p>
<p>Okay, so in that thought experiment,</p>
<p>a question for you is would you be feeling</p>
<p>that same inner subjective sense?</p>
<p>Stimulus is gone, every neuron&rsquo;s doing the same thing</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m controlling it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a philosophical question there.</p>
<p>If you ask me specifically, I would say yes.</p>
<p>Okay, good, most people would say that</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s hard to say no, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very hard to say no.</p>
<p>If every cell in your brain is doing what it was doing,</p>
<p>what else could be different?</p>
<p>How could? Well, most normal people would say yes.</p>
<p>Of course, philosophers would then start saying no.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re the ones that say,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in sort of parallel and sorry</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s a bit of an interruption,</p>
<p>but if there&rsquo;s a robot that&rsquo;s conscious in front of you,</p>
<p>if it appears conscious, then it&rsquo;s conscious.</p>
<p>Like to me, of course, philosophers again speak up</p>
<p>and say, well, no, how do you know it&rsquo;s conscious?</p>
<p>Well, how do you know anything is conscious?</p>
<p>And sort of as normal humans,</p>
<p>we tend to lean on the experience</p>
<p>versus some kind of philosophical concept.</p>
<p>So the great thing about what you just said,</p>
<p>the Turing test is it&rsquo;s very practical.</p>
<p>If it acts conscious, it is conscious.</p>
<p>But I think that&rsquo;s limiting.</p>
<p>I like the thought experiment.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s actually more informative.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m halfway to the conclusion there,</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s take it as your answer was yes,</p>
<p>that you would be feeling the same thing.</p>
<p>Okay, now here&rsquo;s where it gets fun.</p>
<p>Now that every cell in your brain knows what it has to do</p>
<p>in the sense that we know it and we&rsquo;re providing it,</p>
<p>your brain cells don&rsquo;t need to be in your head</p>
<p>anymore at all, right?</p>
<p>The only reason they&rsquo;re next to each other,</p>
<p>the only reason they&rsquo;re wired together</p>
<p>is to affect each other, to stimulate or inhibit each other.</p>
<p>But we don&rsquo;t need that anymore</p>
<p>because optogenetically,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re providing that activity pattern</p>
<p>for as long as needed.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re providing the effect of the communication.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t need to be connected anymore.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t even need to be in your head.</p>
<p>I could spread your neurons all over the continent,</p>
<p>all over the galaxy,</p>
<p>and I could still provide the same stimulus pattern</p>
<p>over 10 or 15 seconds to all those neurons.</p>
<p>And somewhere Lex Friedman would have to be,</p>
<p>even though no longer existing as a physical object anymore,</p>
<p>would be feeling that subjective feeling.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s inescapable</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s exactly the same as the previous situation.</p>
<p>All the neurons have to be spatially,</p>
<p>like the locality constraint,</p>
<p>they have to be spatially close to each other.</p>
<p>And you talk about light opto,</p>
<p>which is funny because light is the fastest traveling thing</p>
<p>that we know of.</p>
<p>Maybe let&rsquo;s not put them all over the universe</p>
<p>because we might get relativistic problems then.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just keep them out.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s keep all your neurons.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s spread them over North America, okay?</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s play them out, same pattern of activity.</p>
<p>And right, it seems absurd, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no way that could be true.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no way that Lex would be feeling</p>
<p>that internal sense</p>
<p>if his neurons were spread all over North America.</p>
<p>And yet it&rsquo;s exactly the same as the previous situation</p>
<p>where you said, sure.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve got a paradox.</p>
<p>And this is what makes people think.</p>
<p>Is it a paradox though, sorry?</p>
<p>Well, maybe paradox is the wrong word.</p>
<p>We got a problem.</p>
<p>We got a problem because it reveals</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s something big about those,</p>
<p>that internal subjective state that we&rsquo;re not explaining.</p>
<p>And we don&rsquo;t really have a hope of explaining</p>
<p>in the near future.</p>
<p>But don&rsquo;t you think we would still have that?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just the word internal loses meaning,</p>
<p>but don&rsquo;t you think we still have</p>
<p>that internal subjective state?</p>
<p>Or if not, then where the heck is the magic coming from?</p>
<p>Okay, well, I just think,</p>
<p>I think one of the problems</p>
<p>that I think we need to let go of</p>
<p>is we tend to, outside of the experience of consciousness,</p>
<p>the hard problem of consciousness,</p>
<p>we tend to think that we individual humans</p>
<p>are really special.</p>
<p>Not the subjective experience,</p>
<p>but the entirety of it, like the body</p>
<p>that contains the thing.</p>
<p>So the local, the constraint of all the stuff</p>
<p>has to be together, and it&rsquo;s all mine.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a very, I don&rsquo;t know if that has anything to do</p>
<p>with the mechanisms that are creating this.</p>
<p>So in fact, one really nice way to break through that</p>
<p>is to either observe or create consciousness</p>
<p>that spans multiple organisms.</p>
<p>Sort of like, let&rsquo;s say it&rsquo;s not an organism dependent</p>
<p>phenomena, that the phenomena can,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just a peculiar way it has evolved on Earth,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a phenomena that doesn&rsquo;t have anything to do</p>
<p>with a specific biological system.</p>
<p>Right, so and we have different parts of our brain exist</p>
<p>and sometimes create complex awarenesses of things</p>
<p>that involve different neurons that are distributed widely</p>
<p>and that need to communicate with each other</p>
<p>to form this joint representation,</p>
<p>this state of consciousness.</p>
<p>But indeed, why do they have to be in the same head?</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know why that would be the case that they do.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s a huge unanswered question in the field</p>
<p>is what is it that binds the activity of neurons together</p>
<p>so they can form a joint representation?</p>
<p>And actually this comes back to the dissociation experiment</p>
<p>we talked about before, where your sense of self</p>
<p>becomes separated from your body.</p>
<p>Those things that were fused in a joint representation,</p>
<p>the same concept, unitary, are now separate.</p>
<p>And in late 2020, we published a paper in Nature</p>
<p>showing how this could be.</p>
<p>We used optogenetics to drive this rhythm</p>
<p>that ketamine and PCP cause in retrosplenial cortex</p>
<p>and we got different parts of the brain to be out of sync</p>
<p>and when they were active, never able to be active</p>
<p>at the same time, never able to form</p>
<p>a joint representation at the same time.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;ve got a toehold into these questions.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have the answers, but.</p>
<p>And that mimics the dynamics of ketamine effects.</p>
<p>Exactly, exactly.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re able to find that kind of oscillation.</p>
<p>Wow, wow, wow.</p>
<p>I see if you get even greater and greater control</p>
<p>with more control over individual neurons</p>
<p>and understanding, like if you think of certain neurons</p>
<p>that having some role to play in the sense of self,</p>
<p>you can play like an orchestra.</p>
<p>That, to create certain degrees of consciousness,</p>
<p>degrees of subjectivity, and thereby understand</p>
<p>what is consciousness.</p>
<p>But by having a very complicated light switch essentially.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s the challenge is the nice thing</p>
<p>about the thought experiment is it kind of highlights</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re gonna hit a point where</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re addressing some very, very fundamental questions.</p>
<p>What allows the activity of two sets of neurons</p>
<p>to become mutually relevant to each other?</p>
<p>This is in some ways maybe one of the deepest</p>
<p>remaining questions in neuroscience is what allows</p>
<p>activity patterns to become relevant to each other?</p>
<p>Do they have to be in sync temporarily?</p>
<p>Do they need to be, is there some other quality</p>
<p>that we don&rsquo;t know about that also needs to be present</p>
<p>to allow cells to fuse together into a joint representation?</p>
<p>Just so I understand, because it feels close</p>
<p>to some very, very deep idea.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a bunch of semi distributed signals</p>
<p>going on in the brain.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re saying there could be something</p>
<p>like a theory of everything if one to exist</p>
<p>is to understand why, how and why signals</p>
<p>close to each other start becoming relevant to each other</p>
<p>as part of some very much bigger signal</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re producing.</p>
<p>How they coordinate, essentially.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s very distributed.</p>
<p>I mean that&rsquo;s a kind of, within a distributed system,</p>
<p>how is order achieved?</p>
<p>And this is a very specific kind of distributed system</p>
<p>that is one of the most intelligent that we&rsquo;re aware of</p>
<p>in the known universe.</p>
<p>In that would maybe be something also,</p>
<p>an understanding of the full conscious experience too.</p>
<p>That this kind of coordination.</p>
<p>How does the coordination between different neurons</p>
<p>that are responsible for sense of self,</p>
<p>how do they begin to form a big picture</p>
<p>that we see as a human experience?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really, really interesting.</p>
<p>So uniting the small and the,</p>
<p>I mean that&rsquo;s actually literally theory of everything.</p>
<p>Uniting the small, the sort of the theory of the neuron.</p>
<p>The functioning of the neuron with the big.</p>
<p>Just the functioning of the entire mind.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>And I think keeping a toehold in both</p>
<p>at the cellular level of resolution</p>
<p>and the brain wide resolution will be critical.</p>
<p>If you lose touch with either,</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;ll miss the big insight.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re trying to do.</p>
<p>Keeping grounded in the cellular resolution.</p>
<p>Trying to keep the broadest brain wide perspective</p>
<p>and meet in the middle.</p>
<p>Do you think you&rsquo;ll see it in your lifetime?</p>
<p>A major breakthrough in that dimension.</p>
<p>I have hope.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very hard to predict what will happen</p>
<p>with big things like this.</p>
<p>If we don&rsquo;t get there,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;ll be plenty of other exciting stuff.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>But the other aspect of this whole thing</p>
<p>is that your life is pretty short.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>So first of all, you can die any day.</p>
<p>I tend to try to think about that,</p>
<p>that it ends, it can end any moment</p>
<p>because it really, really can.</p>
<p>And if not, it&rsquo;ll be soon anyway.</p>
<p>Do you think about that?</p>
<p>Do you think about your mortality?</p>
<p>I do, yeah.</p>
<p>It comes back to what we talked about earlier.</p>
<p>I never think I&rsquo;ve done enough</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s relevant to that for sure.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a deadline.</p>
<p>Do you think there&rsquo;s ever going to be a feeling</p>
<p>where you sit back and you&rsquo;re really proud of yourself?</p>
<p>I hope so.</p>
<p>Like, I&rsquo;ve done enough.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done everything there is.</p>
<p>Because the thing is,</p>
<p>a warrior has some number of battles in them.</p>
<p>And at a certain point, if you&rsquo;re deeply honest,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, well, that was a pretty good run.</p>
<p>As far as runs goes, that was pretty good.</p>
<p>And you can hang up your helmet</p>
<p>and then go sort of drink some ale,</p>
<p>listen to some music with the old lady,</p>
<p>and say, I did pretty good.</p>
<p>You think you&rsquo;ll get there?</p>
<p>You know, with something,</p>
<p>nature always has surprises for us.</p>
<p>The curious mind is always after more.</p>
<p>But biology gives us other rewards.</p>
<p>Children and family, community.</p>
<p>And one can feel good about those things.</p>
<p>Biology is full of rewards.</p>
<p>But do you think about those rewards?</p>
<p>What do you think is the why of those rewards?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the meaning of life and this existence?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the why of biology?</p>
<p>What does it want from us?</p>
<p>Why are all these cells very busy</p>
<p>putting together an organism</p>
<p>that seems to want to just be in a hurry to do stuff</p>
<p>and survive, but it&rsquo;s not happy being survived.</p>
<p>Like you said, it&rsquo;s curious.</p>
<p>It keeps wanting to get into more trouble.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Yeah, you know, we&rsquo;re clearly designed for that, right?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re clearly designed to ask why and to answer.</p>
<p>And that, I think, is,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know the meaning of all life.</p>
<p>I think a meaning of our lives is that.</p>
<p>And this is the Aristotelian happiness.</p>
<p>An organism is happy, an animal&rsquo;s happy</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s performing to its design, right?</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s doing what it was made for.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, you have to understand, what&rsquo;s the design?</p>
<p>And, you know, who is the designer</p>
<p>and what were they up to and how hard is it?</p>
<p>Do you have to build the whole universe?</p>
<p>And does the design even know what the hell they&rsquo;re doing?</p>
<p>Because, you know, maybe the designer built humans</p>
<p>to find out about themselves.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I would do.</p>
<p>Like, if I had the power to build clones,</p>
<p>I would build a lot of clones</p>
<p>and I would get them into different trouble</p>
<p>to understand, like, what am I designed,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s this body designed to do?</p>
<p>How far can I go that way?</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>And then, and I dissociate myself completely</p>
<p>from having any way to know, like, that I know that person.</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>I mean, I suppose you could do that</p>
<p>in a single person&rsquo;s body, but dissociation, you could.</p>
<p>Yeah, but I do wonder what,</p>
<p>if you look at Earth as a collection of humans,</p>
<p>as a collection of biological organisms,</p>
<p>it seems that we&rsquo;re busy doing something</p>
<p>and it just seems too beautiful and too special</p>
<p>to be a random, a random experiment.</p>
<p>It seems like it&rsquo;s an experiment that&rsquo;s cleverly designed</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>by some forces of nature</p>
<p>that are beyond our current understanding.</p>
<p>And maybe that&rsquo;s part of our design,</p>
<p>is to keep asking why.</p>
<p>You said answer.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure that&rsquo;s part of the design, the answer.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re given just the sufficiently limited</p>
<p>cognitive capability that we know how to long</p>
<p>to find the answer and we lack the ability</p>
<p>to find the answer.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s basically a summary of your career.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m just kidding.</p>
<p>And then we give each other Nobel Prizes</p>
<p>for having even an inkling of a good step</p>
<p>towards the right direction.</p>
<p>Carl, you&rsquo;re an incredible human being.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a huge fan of who you are as a person,</p>
<p>who you are as a scientist, who you are as a writer.</p>
<p>I just thank you so much.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so honored that you would sit down</p>
<p>and talk to me today.</p>
<p>It was amazing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been incredibly fun.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s do it again sometime.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s do it again.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been really great.</p>
<p>Your insights and wit and modesty</p>
<p>are really quite rewarding.</p>
<p>Thank you so much, man.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation</p>
<p>with Carl Diceroth.</p>
<p>To support this podcast,</p>
<p>please check out our sponsors in the description.</p>
<p>And now, let me leave you with some words from Carl Jung.</p>
<p>Knowing your own darkness is the best method</p>
<p>for dealing with the darkness of other people.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.</p>
