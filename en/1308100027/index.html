    <p>So are we supposed to start the podcast?</p>
<p>Can you clap?</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>One, two, three.</p>
<p>There you go.</p>
<p>I was pretty, I mean, fierce.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re getting so good.</p>
<p>I think I should probably go on tour with my clapping.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You could do a little shimmy afterwards.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>A big shimmy.</p>
<p>A clap and a big shimmy with the Sagin&rsquo; Dragons.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>Well, today we are going to roll out from our listener what you guys have had it with.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t you love these prompts?</p>
<p>This is like becoming my favorite pastime.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re so good.</p>
<p>I love it so much because I think everybody has had it with something out there.</p>
<p>And if they say they haven&rsquo;t had it with something, then I don&rsquo;t even want to be their friend.</p>
<p>No, we don&rsquo;t want them as listeners.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t trust people that don&rsquo;t have some kind of complaint.</p>
<p>I agree.</p>
<p>I agree.</p>
<p>Kylie, would you please play our first contestant?</p>
<p>The first one is going to be from Lauren Z.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Lauren.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had it with fucking minivan drivers.</p>
<p>They always pull out right in front of you in those goddamn little baby buses, and then</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t ever go the speed limit.</p>
<p>They damn sure don&rsquo;t go above the speed limit, and they usually get in the fast lane and</p>
<p>slow everybody else down.</p>
<p>Fucking had it.</p>
<p>So true.</p>
<p>100% true.</p>
<p>And do you remember my policy?</p>
<p>I had a policy that I would not drive behind a minivan.</p>
<p>I remember.</p>
<p>I mean, they&rsquo;re the worst.</p>
<p>The worst.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s awful.</p>
<p>I have always hated minivans.</p>
<p>Hated.</p>
<p>Lauren, I hate minivans with everything in me.</p>
<p>Even if I get in an Uber and it&rsquo;s a minivan Uber, I immediately feel like the biggest</p>
<p>fucking dweeb on the planet.</p>
<p>Hate minivans.</p>
<p>And I have a really very super cute girlfriend that when her kids were little, she had a</p>
<p>minivan, and I would tell her all the time, you are way too cute to drive a minivan.</p>
<p>Do you remember in the 80s, like the vans that were kind of cool?</p>
<p>Cargo van, kind of bigger.</p>
<p>Well, they had like the shag carpet in the back, and like I remember this girl I grew</p>
<p>up with.</p>
<p>Her name was Julie, and her mom had this swanky van.</p>
<p>And then something happened in the 90s where these minivans got rolled out, and it is dork.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s dork city.</p>
<p>Nation.</p>
<p>But I have to say, when we&rsquo;ve gone on vacation and had to rent cars when the kids were little,</p>
<p>they are convenient for little kids.</p>
<p>I mean, I would never have one, obviously, but I kind of get it on a vacation.</p>
<p>You rented a minivan?</p>
<p>Yeah, on several different vacations when the kids were little.</p>
<p>So you both hate minivans, but are also a minivan renter?</p>
<p>Yeah, because you have the car seats and all that when they&rsquo;re little.</p>
<p>What about an SUV?</p>
<p>I think we accidentally got a minivan one time because they were out of SUVs, and then</p>
<p>we kind of liked it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty easy by comparison.</p>
<p>Am I going crazy here, or did she just do a complete 180?</p>
<p>No, I hate minivans.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like a complete schizo.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t drive so.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>Complete schizophrenic.</p>
<p>You start off, I hate minivans.</p>
<p>I hate minivans.</p>
<p>Dork city.</p>
<p>And then you just said, I kind of love minivans.</p>
<p>On a vacation when you have to drive where you don&rsquo;t know where you&rsquo;re going, it&rsquo;s easy</p>
<p>for the kids.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the only point I&rsquo;m making.</p>
<p>I find them detestable.</p>
<p>Okay, listener, just so, in case you&rsquo;re just now tuning in, because there&rsquo;s a lot of whiplash</p>
<p>on I&rsquo;ve had it, bonus content episode.</p>
<p>Pimps hates minivans, despises them, dweeb city, dork city, dork nation, loves a minivan</p>
<p>on a vacation.</p>
<p>When the kids were little, I did.</p>
<p>When the kids were little.</p>
<p>She did it for the kids.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>She did it for everybody.</p>
<p>You can do anything nice for kids.</p>
<p>She did it for the kids.</p>
<p>No, I guess that makes me a big, huge hypocrite, but that&rsquo;s not the first time.</p>
<p>Kylie, what do you think about Pimps&rsquo; about face?</p>
<p>You know what?</p>
<p>I grew up, my grandfather had one of those vans that you were talking about, the cool</p>
<p>ones.</p>
<p>The cool ones.</p>
<p>It had like a VHS player, which was super cool.</p>
<p>It had the carpet.</p>
<p>It had the blinds.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the Scooby van.</p>
<p>It was so cool.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the Scooby Dooby Doo.</p>
<p>Now they look like pedophile vans to me though.</p>
<p>Like if I saw someone driving it, I&rsquo;m like, uh oh.</p>
<p>But I think that my mom had a minivan when I was growing up.</p>
<p>Luckily, I was too young to remember.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>God, thank God, because Lord only knows where you would have ended up, Kylie, had you been</p>
<p>toted around in that minivan consciously.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s probably why I&rsquo;m gay.</p>
<p>100%.</p>
<p>The minivan did it, kids.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s next, Kylie?</p>
<p>Up next, we&rsquo;ve got Devin V.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had it with any kind of fucking journey.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care about your fucking wellness journey, your divorce journey, your journey journey.</p>
<p>I want that term to go away.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had it.</p>
<p>Hey fucking men, this is the top, the creme de la creme of the haddots.</p>
<p>The journeys are ridiculous.</p>
<p>My weight loss journey, my exercising journey, my divorce journey, my spiritual journey.</p>
<p>Put a fucking sock in it and go on a real vacation and quit talking about your manufactured</p>
<p>journey.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had it, had it, had it.</p>
<p>I mean, Devin got you right where you live.</p>
<p>She fucking just spoke my love language, which is something else that I&rsquo;ve had it with</p>
<p>or love languages and Devin, you just spoke my love language.</p>
<p>Following people you know on Instagram or on social media has become insufferable because</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re inviting you along on something that should be private and they make it a public</p>
<p>journey that they assume we all give a shit about.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had it.</p>
<p>We just want the salacious details.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t want the whole journey.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s get the cliff notes.</p>
<p>My husband fucked around.</p>
<p>It was his secretary.</p>
<p>I caught him in the closet.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t need a whole journey.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t need to go through the journey of it and it&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s enough, enough, enough</p>
<p>with self-help books, with the journeys, with, oh, here&rsquo;s one thing that bugs the shit</p>
<p>out of me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m manifesting.</p>
<p>The vision board.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m manifesting.</p>
<p>So I went down a deep, horrible Instagram dive this weekend.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s this girl, she probably has a gajillion Instagram followers, but what piqued my interest,</p>
<p>it was on my For You page, is she pulls up in a Rolls Royce in front of this massive</p>
<p>fucking private plane, right?</p>
<p>And her husband opens up the car and they like kiss and then she like waltzes up the</p>
<p>stairs and I was like, well, who&rsquo;s this fucking little twat rolling up in her Rolls and then</p>
<p>climbing up on her PJs?</p>
<p>So naturally I go back 747 weeks and her Instagram profile is one would do if they&rsquo;re disgusted</p>
<p>with somebody&rsquo;s behavior.</p>
<p>And one of her posts, it&rsquo;s like her and her husband and her Birkin bag and her Rolls Royce,</p>
<p>her husband&rsquo;s matching Rolls Royce and the biggest fucking private plane you&rsquo;ve ever</p>
<p>seen in your life.</p>
<p>And she literally writes in the comment section, I manifested this life.</p>
<p>I thought about it and I made it come true.</p>
<p>And so for the listener, I just want you to know if you want a Rolls Royce and a big fucking</p>
<p>private plane and multiple Birkin bags, just think about it, right?</p>
<p>Just manifest it.</p>
<p>Just think and pray and think.</p>
<p>Thoughts and prayers and manifesting and you too will be the asshole on Instagram and the</p>
<p>Rolls Royce and the fucking PJ.</p>
<p>I bet if you got to the deep, dark bottom of it, she just had rich parents.</p>
<p>I bet if you got to the deep, dark bottom of it, she could fucking suck the chrome off</p>
<p>of a tailpipe and gives an A plus blow job and delivers them to her rich husband 24,</p>
<p>7, 365.</p>
<p>But I mean, one could argue that&rsquo;s manifesting.</p>
<p>That is true.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll tell you what, if we can manifest a PJ, let&rsquo;s start now.</p>
<p>Pumps can&rsquo;t get back.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to show you this gal&rsquo;s Instagram.</p>
<p>I mean, I just can&rsquo;t even wrap my head around it.</p>
<p>She manifested the PJ and she wrote that down on the internet for everyone to see.</p>
<p>It was her PJ journey manifested.</p>
<p>Well, we need to start manifesting.</p>
<p>All it takes is thinking about a PJ.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s get down on our knees and start thinking.</p>
<p>I think you got to get down on your knees and start sucking chrome off a tailpipe.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s what you got to do, sis.</p>
<p>Sounds like commercial for me.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>The next one is going to be Kate H.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had it with older moms who feel like they should punish us for the conveniences</p>
<p>that our society has now created that we&rsquo;re taking advantage of.</p>
<p>I understand you had to duct tape your child to the back of your car to get them over to</p>
<p>the closest Kroger, but now we have car seats that swivel and that&rsquo;s awesome.</p>
<p>So why are you giving me shit for utilizing that?</p>
<p>Just because they didn&rsquo;t have cars in the 1600, does that mean that we shouldn&rsquo;t use</p>
<p>cars now that they&rsquo;re invented?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve just had it.</p>
<p>Okay, Kate.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s my deal.</p>
<p>All the shit that you guys have, and I think that we would be considered older moms, pumps</p>
<p>in particular, but here&rsquo;s the deal.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t give a shit about seeing the kid on the video screen, the swiveling car seats,</p>
<p>swing for the fences.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad you have better technology.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so glad it&rsquo;s more cued up for you to be more vigilant of a parent than we, but where</p>
<p>it really fucking ticks me off from top to bottom are those goddamn young mom parking</p>
<p>spots.</p>
<p>I was just getting ready to say.</p>
<p>Had it.</p>
<p>Had it.</p>
<p>You know, I always park in those because I&rsquo;m like, let someone come out here and say, I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>not pregnant.</p>
<p>I would say, I&rsquo;m pregnant, even though they&rsquo;d say you&rsquo;re a little old.</p>
<p>No, I park in those spots.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s bullshit.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a spot reserved for families with small children and it&rsquo;s like, okay, here&rsquo;s the deal.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with the exception of the handicapped parking space.</p>
<p>Everything else needs to be eliminated.</p>
<p>Hit the bricks.</p>
<p>Fuck it.</p>
<p>Done with it.</p>
<p>I think that parking is Darwinian, right?</p>
<p>Survival of the fittest.</p>
<p>You want a good parking spot?</p>
<p>You get there early.</p>
<p>I, if I don&rsquo;t see a good parking spot, I give up on it and I just go to the back and figure</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m getting that many more steps in.</p>
<p>Or do you manifest?</p>
<p>Oh, I could manifest, manifest before I park my Dodge journey, right?</p>
<p>My journey.</p>
<p>I could manifest my journey of my minivan and get the young kid parking spot.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Kate, here&rsquo;s the deal.</p>
<p>I can see how, you know, older moms back in our day, we didn&rsquo;t have jack shit.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t give a shit.</p>
<p>Being a young mom, you&rsquo;re thrown with so much shit.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t remember what we had.</p>
<p>All the shit.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so much shit.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t give a shit.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a bouncy thing and you got a vibrating chair and you got a car seat and you got all</p>
<p>the shit you got to schlep around.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing fun about it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think your part of being a mom is easier than ours was at all, but I&rsquo;ve had</p>
<p>it with those parking spots.</p>
<p>Those parking places, they just grind my gears.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s bullshit.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s bullshit.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s total bullshit.</p>
<p>Get rid of all privileged parking spots.</p>
<p>You know, hospitals, you go to hospitals and preserve for Dr. Such and such, fuck Dr. Such</p>
<p>and such.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I always park in those spots.</p>
<p>I have zero issue impersonating.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just like a parking lot tyrant.</p>
<p>I am.</p>
<p>Survival of the fittest.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m on the top of that heap.</p>
<p>Look at you.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I think that, Kate, these women that are bitter, that your car seat swivels, I mean, that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just, are they like wanting to be young moms again?</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s not fun to have an infant.</p>
<p>No, it sucks.</p>
<p>Those newborn babies are Chinese water torture.</p>
<p>The worst.</p>
<p>What have I always said?</p>
<p>If you were to put all those prisoners at Guantanamo Bay in with infants and they had</p>
<p>to take care of them, they would sing like birds.</p>
<p>Immediately.</p>
<p>I give it four or five days, torture them with a brand new baby.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;ll do it.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the truest torture.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had a podcast where we embrace little babies with their mommies on the teat.</p>
<p>All right, Kylie, who&rsquo;s next?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>To end our journey today, we&rsquo;ve got Jessica S. with her own PI story.</p>
<p>Ooh.</p>
<p>I just listened to the episode of The Private Investigators and The Cheating Husbands, and</p>
<p>I have a cheating husband story as well, and me and my best friend were basically PIs.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve combed through the phone records, and my best friend drove from Houston to Austin</p>
<p>in the middle of the night to catch my ex to see where he was, and he tried to say he</p>
<p>was sleeping in his van, and she followed him to a neighborhood that I later found out</p>
<p>where the other woman lived, and I just have so many stories.</p>
<p>I was laughing at the stupid excuses, like the IHOP story my husband told me one time</p>
<p>that his phone died because the Airbnb he was staying at had old electricity.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s unbelievable, this stupid shit.</p>
<p>It is unbelievable, and I think that episode was so relatable, because if you have been</p>
<p>so fortunate to date just fucking upstanding, fine young men, good for you, and I mean that.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>Great for you.</p>
<p>But most people have found themselves in troublesome relationships or have a very good friend.</p>
<p>I would have totally done that, and you for me, driven from Houston to Austin and busted</p>
<p>the case wide open.</p>
<p>I love it that she drove from Houston to Austin.</p>
<p>She was on it.</p>
<p>I did a full-blown AT&amp;T con.</p>
<p>I have had a friend call me and say, I think my husband is with his girlfriend at a spot</p>
<p>in Oklahoma City.</p>
<p>I remember this.</p>
<p>It was Christmas Eve.</p>
<p>You drove up there to the restaurant.</p>
<p>I drove up there to the restaurant, fucking fronted them both out right then and acted</p>
<p>like I was buying gift cards on Christmas Eve at a restaurant.</p>
<p>Yeah, I just marched right in there, and I was like, what&rsquo;s going on here?</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>A best friend is the best thing to have in the world, period, the end, but especially</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;ve got a cheater on your hands.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I love you, absolutely, because it&rsquo;s so painful and so hurtful, and only your girlfriends</p>
<p>can help get you through that and that camaraderie.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I love to your girlfriend that drove from Houston to Austin in the middle of the night.</p>
<p>He was sleeping in his car.</p>
<p>He had old electricity.</p>
<p>Shut the fuck up.</p>
<p>Go suck a bag of dicks.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Go get you some.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What an asshole.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re better off without him.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re better off without him, and good for you and your girlfriend, because that is some</p>
<p>bullshit.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>That is some bullshit.</p>
<p>Well, Pumps, is there anything you&rsquo;d like to add on this bonus episode?</p>
<p>Any bonus content?</p>
<p>Any bonus content that I can think of right now?</p>
<p>You got nothing?</p>
<p>I got nothing.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s got nothing.</p>
<p>Got nothing.</p>
<p>Maybe we should start a podcast and call it Got Nothing.</p>
<p>Send us more voice memos via Instagram.</p>
<p>You can DM those to us.</p>
<p>Follow us.</p>
<p>Subscribe.</p>
<p>Like.</p>
<p>Pumps, tell everybody when we&rsquo;re going to see them.</p>
<p>See you next Tuesday.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you what I&rsquo;ve had it with.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s hear it.</p>
