And now, it&amp;rsquo;s over.
But we have goddamn New Year&amp;rsquo;s to look forward to.'>

<p>Call him daddy.</p>
<p>Do I call her daddy?</p>
<p>Call her daddy.</p>
<p>Okay, Daddy&rsquo;s, it is Alex, and Sophia back at it again.</p>
<p>0:20</p>
<p>Happy day after Christmas.</p>
<p>This is such a sad time of the day after it&rsquo;s just a little anticlimactic because it&rsquo;s, like we lead up to all of that and then you get your presents from Santa daddy, daddy.</p>
<p>And now, it&rsquo;s over.</p>
<p>But we have goddamn New Year&rsquo;s to look forward to.</p>
<p>0:38</p>
<p>Thank the Lord.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Yeah, Sophie and I are going somewhere, a little tropical.</p>
<p>Get our Tan on, but this episode is going to be a little bit shorter because, well, Sophia and I are, unfortunately, she&rsquo;s in Utah and in Pennsylvania right now, but we have, we&rsquo;ve got a little something, we do have a little something, a little raunchy Dante&rsquo;s business, tea, ladies and gentlemen, for those of you who don&rsquo;t know what business t means.</p>
<p>1:08</p>
<p>Because I know a lot of our call her daddy audience is not even from Barstool.</p>
<p>So business T, is This guy&rsquo;s nickname.</p>
<p>His real name is Paul bissonnette.</p>
<p>He has the spit and Chiclets podcast.</p>
<p>That is one of our biggest shows here at Barstool.</p>
<p>So we were lucky enough to sit down with him, chat with him.</p>
<p>1:26</p>
<p>You guys will hear the interview.</p>
<p>I think he was a little nervous.</p>
<p>We had an amazing collaboration.</p>
<p>There were some, you know, uncomfortable moments of Great Moments.</p>
<p>We laughed, we cried, we got naked.</p>
<p>As you guys know, call her daddy, we are Specific podcast, guys.</p>
<p>1:46</p>
<p>Met a lot of people can hang with the daddy gang.</p>
<p>I think Paul did a great job.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to play the clip for you guys because it&rsquo;s been so highly requested and joy.</p>
<p>Sit back, relax.</p>
<p>Here is our interview.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Daddy gain.</p>
<p>We have a visitor.</p>
<p>2:01</p>
<p>Paul bissonnette.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a beautiful name, sir.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>So today, you&rsquo;re just going to be Biz Daddy.</p>
<p>Just on-brand for us.</p>
<p>So why do you think people think Think that we should collaborate, like what was it?</p>
<p>Because as far as a bit of a history, okay, when I played, I was pretty vocal about what was going on in the back behind the scenes.</p>
<p>2:23</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I taught I told a story on our podcast.</p>
<p>That was a little aggressive.</p>
<p>I just have to be weary that I do work with an NHL team and right, anyone listening.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know when I speak, I speak for myself.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t speak for the team.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I, I think they&rsquo;re, well, aware that of the things that have gone on in my life and they Embrace, they embrace me for who I am.</p>
<p>2:44</p>
<p>They also like, yo your you can&rsquo;t be like, no, I think that&rsquo;s hardcore.</p>
<p>I bought this.</p>
<p>Make it hardcore.</p>
<p>Can we ask if the story was the house of no return?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve told that on the spit and Chiclets podcast.</p>
<p>Long story short, we end up when I&rsquo;m going to this place called pussycat Lounge.</p>
<p>3:01</p>
<p>I ran into an old girl that I used to hook up with and briefly had a conversation.</p>
<p>Then five minutes later, some beautiful woman.</p>
<p>Comes strolling over and Taps.</p>
<p>You on the shoulder and he&rsquo;s are girl.</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t want to sound shallow, the hottest broad you ever seen.</p>
<p>3:19</p>
<p>Other one was attractive.</p>
<p>This one was like, whoa.</p>
<p>Okay, like why is this strange woman coming up to me?</p>
<p>Like maybe she could feel the energy coming off our table because we had a ten guys out.</p>
<p>We were celebrating.</p>
<p>Obviously.</p>
<p>We look like athletes and she went right to it.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s like, hey, I&rsquo;m such a such as friend.</p>
<p>3:34</p>
<p>Like, what are you doing after?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, oh, like probably just going home and she&rsquo;s like, no, why don&rsquo;t you come over to our place?</p>
<p>We have like stripper poles.</p>
<p>Sex toys.</p>
<p>Love that like just like right into it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It was like home.</p>
<p>Shit, so, we had a driving this place in an Uber, and it took forever.</p>
<p>It was like an hour away and it was, it was aggressive.</p>
<p>3:52</p>
<p>There was like, fucking techno music blaring through the house.</p>
<p>There was other girls that were not at the bar that were at the house like a waiting, love it, and things escalated.</p>
<p>And there was like orgies.</p>
<p>Yeah, like I&rsquo;m heterosexual.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t mess with guys.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t if you&rsquo;re a guy and you like guys, I don&rsquo;t care, be, alrighty, whatever you do.</p>
<p>4:11</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very liberal when it comes to Grey.</p>
<p>Asexual.</p>
<p>Mindset and it escalated through the night.</p>
<p>And last thing that ended up happening was, I was on this big leopard-print bean bag.</p>
<p>Chair in the guy who was like, I would say a common log / married to the girl who came up the smoke show.</p>
<p>4:30</p>
<p>Well, he was getting a blowjob on the other side of this, huge beanbag chair.</p>
<p>And I was on this side by someone else, and the wife says he Dan, is it?</p>
<p>Okay?</p>
<p>And I kind of overheard that and he said, whatever makes you happy and she Love power and like, gave the other one, the shoulder tap and I could I could feel his eyes in the back of my head though while she was performing and it made me very uncomfortable, though.</p>
<p>4:53</p>
<p>It did.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>He might be saying that I would assume just to keep her happy because you know, like not to sound shallow, but she was like a fucking 10, right?</p>
<p>Well, maybe he wasn&rsquo;t the town well because you know about like cuckolding like guys think it&rsquo;s hot to watch like their girl.</p>
<p>5:09</p>
<p>Fuck another guy in front of them.</p>
<p>Like do you think that was a situation or maybe, you know, I I think that it was it was he gets to have his cake and eat it too.</p>
<p>And okay.</p>
<p>She wanted a piece of my action and it was like, yo, like you get enough I do enough for you.</p>
<p>Now.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s my turn and where I didn&rsquo;t want to hurt him to feel like oh shit.</p>
<p>5:28</p>
<p>My wife wants to do that.</p>
<p>To write me.</p>
<p>That makes me uncomfortable because I&rsquo;m, you know, I&rsquo;m not a mean person.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well it was it that that was kind of awkward getting a blowjob in front of another guy&rsquo;s girl.</p>
<p>I could see ya.</p>
<p>I know a blow job from another guy.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I was, I was going to say where you XXX, I think there are some guys.</p>
<p>5:45</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t give a shit but like, you were kind of a little on edge about it.</p>
<p>Yeah, I didn&rsquo;t last very long.</p>
<p>I think I think the or in the room had kind of change and everyone was a little uncomfortable by you didn&rsquo;t last long.</p>
<p>You didn&rsquo;t last long on Earth really fast nor you couldn&rsquo;t say hard never know, like, like kind of like it was very good.</p>
<p>6:03</p>
<p>So I couldn&rsquo;t tell her to stop but I think that she finally realized that maybe he wasn&rsquo;t totally down with ya so that it was back to the switcheroos.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>

<p>No, I love that.</p>
<p>So Sophie and I have some questions for you, one.</p>
<p>Just, okay, the uncircumcised thing.</p>
<p>7:52</p>
<p>Canadians, typically don&rsquo;t get circumcised more so than maybe Americans.</p>
<p>Okay, because I have a lot of friends who are not circumcised and I heard, it&rsquo;s better sexual pleasure for the gun.</p>
<p>Oh, we heard for the girl.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that.</p>
<p>Girl, so we should joke around, call it the French tickler and stuff and my Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>8:12</p>
<p>Okay, so we have had a lot of people write in obviously mixed reviews.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve joked when I was younger and immature.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, I wouldn&rsquo;t know what to do with that thing.</p>
<p>But I have a question for you.</p>
<p>She want it like bubblegum.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I figure.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s usually what I do to a dick right.</p>
<p>Turkey jerky, right.</p>
<p>8:27</p>
<p>Just a little bit of extra meat.</p>
<p>So what have you ever gotten a reaction from a girl being like what?</p>
<p>What do I do with that?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been with a couple girls that they say that I&rsquo;m the first person they&rsquo;ve ever With who has not been circumcised.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Do you like walk them through it?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s no different.</p>
<p>Like when it gets hard, it just kind of like rolls back.</p>
<p>8:45</p>
<p>Okay, some people.</p>
<p>I mean there&rsquo;s different types, right?</p>
<p>I mean, some people have longer than others and about vaginas.</p>
<p>Okay, this China flock, let&rsquo;s just scare you if they&rsquo;re like super long.</p>
<p>No, no.</p>
<p>No, I don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really discriminate all shapes and sizes.</p>
<p>9:00</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t beautiful.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So like if there&rsquo;s someone you guys have big lips or is that like, is that Yeah, I mean is it frowned upon in the female Community?</p>
<p>Like oh, she&rsquo;s got huge lettuces.</p>
<p>Like they were born with huge lips.</p>
<p>Like who cares?</p>
<p>Like?</p>
<p>Yeah, I can get surgery to trim them up.</p>
<p>9:17</p>
<p>Like yeah, so many girls right in that are really embarrassing insecure about that book that I know will cause some guys are dicks and they&rsquo;re like, holy shit.</p>
<p>Like she&rsquo;s got like roast beef and I&rsquo;m like, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what guys are into.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>Some guys are obviously more into like the hot dog bun thing that you see in porn, which is totally not.</p>
<p>9:35</p>
<p>So humble brag that you don&rsquo;t have.</p>
<p>Beef curtains.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m working with the hot and I&rsquo;m just kidding.</p>
<p>Let me look up some questions.</p>
<p>I have you ladies listening?</p>
<p>And you have like, like beef, curtains or roast beef.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t be embarrassed.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>Great yourself.</p>
<p>My aunt&rsquo;s is guys fucking love it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like extra me right?</p>
<p>9:52</p>
<p>She said, okay.</p>
<p>I love you.</p>
<p>Rach.</p>
<p>Can I ask you how often are you fucking girls?</p>
<p>That have are like squirters?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve, I mean, I&rsquo;ve had a few in my day.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never dated one.</p>
<p>Okay, we&rsquo;ve had girls.</p>
<p>10:08</p>
<p>Sometimes that&rsquo;s a like they literally try not to come and like squirt sometimes because they&rsquo;re so embarrassed about it.</p>
<p>What are, you know, I mean guys, obviously, as you can see, I&rsquo;m really embarrassed about anything.</p>
<p>I could see why some girls May.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, they also might be having sex with a guy in squirting in front of them.</p>
<p>10:25</p>
<p>That has never experienced that or even seen that all heard of it.</p>
<p>Now with the internet.</p>
<p>At these days, that&rsquo;s maybe a little bit unlikely.</p>
<p>There is never at least heard or seen it.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a girl in Vancouver and you know, she&rsquo;s been with a lot of guys and she has a nickname called the Super Soaker.</p>
<p>10:43</p>
<p>Okay, and I she actually has a one-bedroom apartment, but in the living room, she has a Murphy bed and it on the Murphy bed, as we&rsquo;re lucky.</p>
<p>Yeah, so she&rsquo;s got like, she&rsquo;s like the female Batman.</p>
<p>Well, she was just like, right.</p>
<p>Like Wilford comes out.</p>
<p>10:58</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s got the towel and shit.</p>
<p>I fucking love it.</p>
<p>That cave at least.</p>
<p>At least she owns you might come gave.</p>
<p>Oh my God, that&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>Do you have like a certain type?</p>
<p>Like you have a certain type of girl?</p>
<p>Or I don&rsquo;t discriminate at all.</p>
<p>11:13</p>
<p>I know you don&rsquo;t discriminate.</p>
<p>But like is there a girl like, you know that you&rsquo;re like more into like do you like a certain color hair?</p>
<p>Do you like a sore?</p>
<p>Last girlfriend was a blond?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Like what kind of girl do you go for like at a bar like personality-wise?</p>
<p>Oh man.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m 33.</p>
<p>Now if I can&rsquo;t have a full blown conversation with someone like I don&rsquo;t Of course, it&rsquo;s all.</p>
<p>11:32</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all, it&rsquo;s all a mental state.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>First obviously there&rsquo;s initial traction.</p>
<p>Yeah, you know, I mean, I guess I&rsquo;m gonna like is it would you consider me shallow if I kind of course, I love a beautiful woman.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m sorry.</p>
<p>How do you pick up a girl at a bar?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>11:48</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s that?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Like, you can ask for an ally.</p>
<p>I really don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I just kind of stand there.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t I&rsquo;m not really like aggressive.</p>
<p>Like I used to.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, I would say I&rsquo;m like a soft.</p>
<p>I would say, a hard six and a half.</p>
<p>You say shop 770.</p>
<p>I think we have big ears.</p>
<p>12:08</p>
<p>Well, we have to see the whole package and then we yeah, then we&rsquo;ll really yeah.</p>
<p>Can you just tell us hundred?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So let me ask you because we always talk about on our podcast, how we think it&rsquo;s like so annoying when girl because I was a good joke.</p>
<p>12:28</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t actually know your body count, I think.</p>
<p>So annoying, it&rsquo;s like girls, if you want to be lied to ask a guy, his body count.</p>
<p>What the fuck is the point of girls asking?</p>
<p>What do you say?</p>
<p>When a girl asks you that?</p>
<p>Do you ever like tell her number just a moment.</p>
<p>I just think it&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re bragging about how many chicks you&rsquo;ve had sex with.</p>
<p>Like, I like, you know, I&rsquo;ve experimented with record women.</p>
<p>12:46</p>
<p>I went through a phase where I played professional sports, and I was single for like half of that time, right?</p>
<p>And yeah, I&rsquo;m just, I&rsquo;m very, very think it&rsquo;s an image.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t put sex.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t put sex on a pedestal.</p>
<p>Some people do some people like, oh my God, it&rsquo;s disgusting. - man get one life.</p>
<p>13:01</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to live at home, right?</p>
<p>My brain.</p>
<p>Stick it, where you can but but have you okay?</p>
<p>So have you ever had long-term relationships?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I just got out of a three-year.</p>
<p>It was all we were off and on.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really want to get into that.</p>
<p>I know, you&rsquo;ll have to lot of respect for her and she&rsquo;s got a few kids.</p>
<p>13:17</p>
<p>So I wouldn&rsquo;t want to, you know, yeah Akana, did you ever have one while you were playing hockey?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Did you ever cheat on any of your girlfriend&rsquo;s?</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t want to get into that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in fucking.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s all right.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;ve been a bit of a dog.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not proud of it.</p>
<p>13:32</p>
<p>I mean, yes, we have to, no, no, we&rsquo;re over here.</p>
<p>Like, you know what cheating fucking happens.</p>
<p>Move forward.</p>
<p>Like, you guys that you&rsquo;ve been with that are famous.</p>
<p>Like, obviously the music picture.</p>
<p>I forget.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m just kidding.</p>
<p>Yeah, what about it?</p>
<p>13:48</p>
<p>Is?</p>
<p>He upset that you&rsquo;re talking about his, the you and him on here like that.</p>
<p>Is that upside of the biggest issue?</p>
<p>I think.</p>
<p>Is everyone assumes.</p>
<p>Every time.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like my ex.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like, oh my God, it&rsquo;s him.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, I&rsquo;ve dated people seriously sent around y&rsquo;all.</p>
<p>Down here is your Playboy thing.</p>
<p>14:04</p>
<p>I do.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just kidding.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a joke.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s funny.</p>
<p>You say that it we were talking at the yak.</p>
<p>Is that the word the yak, at the bar stool radio?</p>
<p>Yeah, and I had, you know, I hooked up with Baby Jones.</p>
<p>Who was it?</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s up.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s a porn star in Arizona and she got with a Rob Gronkowski as well.</p>
<p>14:23</p>
<p>You know, how she took the picture with Rob and she posted it.</p>
<p>I went through a phase.</p>
<p>I think I was like 25 of the time like old porn star.</p>
<p>Wow, right?</p>
<p>Amazing, right?</p>
<p>Like and so the radio station who would have her on, I would go on as well and they hooked it up.</p>
<p>So we went on a date.</p>
<p>We obviously hooked up, she asked me to post a picture and I was like, whoa, like no notnot down.</p>
<p>14:44</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want people knowing my personal business.</p>
<p>Well, because I didn&rsquo;t post the picture.</p>
<p>She was a little upset.</p>
<p>She went on the radio station the next day to fucking tell the entire Arizona Valley, Phoenix Scottsdale Valley.</p>
<p>That I had a small Hammer.</p>
<p>I was bad in the wrapper and I one of the biggest games of the Season that night my phones blowing up from the radio station to station.</p>
<p>15:05</p>
<p>Tell me to come on defend myself and I&rsquo;m like, holy shit.</p>
<p>Can we ask you like what?</p>
<p>It was like to fuck a porn star?</p>
<p>It was very underwhelming.</p>
<p>Oh, very underwhelming her boy.</p>
<p>So she her phone, was ringing the whole time.</p>
<p>It was just not a great experience.</p>
<p>It was like she was there to like go on the radio the next day answering the phone.</p>
<p>15:23</p>
<p>He did a couple things.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s hot with a girl answers and she has to like, be quiet while she&rsquo;s getting real.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think.</p>
<p>Guess who was calling her boyfriend?</p>
<p>She went into the studio with the next.</p>
<p>Its I think she I think she&rsquo;s got two or three kids in them.</p>
<p>Now.</p>
<p>It was just like, I mean, I think our, the team obviously knew because it was on the local radio station general manager new.</p>
<p>15:44</p>
<p>And I mean nothing really much.</p>
<p>You can say to me at that point because it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>So my personal life that someone can bring it on the radio.</p>
<p>Like I had no control over that.</p>
<p>Yeah, you can Catholic in trouble for that.</p>
<p>What I think we&rsquo;re done.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, if you have any quick questions, you want to ask before we wrap up, I was going.</p>
<p>16:00</p>
<p>To ask you if you&rsquo;ve ever done a DP on a girl.</p>
<p>But you know, you don&rsquo;t have to like double penetrate.</p>
<p>Yeah, like two guys, one way too aggressive.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Thank you really.</p>
<p>Trying to get me fired or what?</p>
<p>Oh, it&rsquo;s like right off the bat if we had but we didn&rsquo;t answer it.</p>
<p>Well-known.</p>
<p>Okay, you&rsquo;ve asked me a bunch of questions.</p>
<p>16:17</p>

<p>Yeah, that you Eyes don&rsquo;t put any of this on Instagram or Twitter for like let&rsquo;s say a a minute clip.</p>
<p>16:36</p>
