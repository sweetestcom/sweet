    <p>All right, this segment is on Ukraine and we call it the Ukraine debate because we have</p>
<p>two great writers and thinkers up here who are on slightly different sides of this issue</p>
<p>of the U.S. involvement in Ukraine.</p>
<p>Antonio Garcia-Martinez is the author of the best-selling book, Chaos Monkeys, about Silicon</p>
<p>Valley.</p>
<p>He writes a sub-stack called Pull Request and also has a great call-in show.</p>
<p>And Glenn Greenwald is back with us from yesterday, also a phenomenal writer, has</p>
<p>an amazing sub-stack all of you guys should check out as well, and a great call-in show.</p>
<p>So in setting up this topic, let me just say I think, you know, that, you know, in thinking</p>
<p>about the U.S. involvement in Ukraine, you know, there&rsquo;s not a lot of debate about this</p>
<p>topic and in that sense, it&rsquo;s pretty similar to other wars that the U.S. has gotten into.</p>
<p>Many of you probably are not old enough to remember when the U.S. got into Iraq or Afghanistan</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m not old enough to remember the U.S. getting into Vietnam, but the thing to understand</p>
<p>about all those wars is that they were incredibly popular at the time that we entered them and</p>
<p>by the time that they ended, they were not.</p>
<p>And now, I&rsquo;m not saying, I&rsquo;m not prejudging Ukraine and saying it&rsquo;s one of those.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s important differences that we should get into, but I think we should</p>
<p>at least have this debate and we need more discussion around this.</p>
<p>And so for that, I&rsquo;m grateful that Antonio and Glenn have decided to participate.</p>
<p>So, what I&rsquo;m going to do is kick it to each of them for kind of five-minute opening statements</p>
<p>and then we&rsquo;ll just get into sort of more of a back and forth and we&rsquo;ll start with Antonio.</p>
<p>Cool.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>Thanks, David.</p>
<p>Thanks for skewing the moderation from like literally the first second, comparing it to</p>
<p>Iraq because I came up here to say it&rsquo;s not about Iraq at all.</p>
<p>But yeah, so let&rsquo;s just start off with I think probably most people here know that I actually</p>
<p>spent some time in Ukraine.</p>
<p>Unlike a lot of the independent voices who decided to opine from afar about Ukraine,</p>
<p>I felt that the American media discourse about Ukraine was completely skewed and it just</p>
<p>smelled kind of bullshitty to me and so I thought I had to go and actually see it.</p>
<p>And so I spent some time on the Polish border with Ukraine.</p>
<p>This was kind of in the earliest part of the war, kind of early March, and the western</p>
<p>part of Ukraine, which by the way, is not particularly dangerous or anything.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably no more dangerous than walking across San Francisco these days, to be honest.</p>
<p>But it was interesting to actually go and see.</p>
<p>And I took away two things.</p>
<p>And I wrote two subsect posts about it that I want to share with you.</p>
<p>Two parts of the Ukraine story.</p>
<p>One, the refugee situation is incredible.</p>
<p>It is something that you have to see to believe and even then you can&rsquo;t quite understand the</p>
<p>scope of it.</p>
<p>Ten million Ukrainians, a quarter of the country is currently displaced.</p>
<p>Something like six million Ukrainians have left in the span of two months.</p>
<p>When you stand at the border at Medica, which is one of the border crossings with Poland,</p>
<p>what you see is you&rsquo;re at it and you realize you&rsquo;re at the fringes of sort of normal western</p>
<p>European life and you&rsquo;ve entered, on the other side of that is hell that people are escaping.</p>
<p>And what do you see?</p>
<p>You see, again, the men can&rsquo;t leave because they&rsquo;re prohibited from leaving because they</p>
<p>have to fight.</p>
<p>And so what you see is old people or women with children, imagine a woman in her 30s</p>
<p>with two kids, a little rolly bag, and like a cat in a bag.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the typical thing.</p>
<p>And just a line of them going over the border again and again and again, right?</p>
<p>And the Poles have been amazing in how they receive the Ukrainians, literally millions</p>
<p>of Ukrainians, but all the same it&rsquo;s an enormous strain.</p>
<p>Everywhere you go in eastern Poland or western Ukraine, that&rsquo;s a big open area, it&rsquo;s basically</p>
<p>a refugee camp, whether it be a train station, repurposed warehouses, all of it.</p>
<p>The human situation is just kind of mind-boggling.</p>
<p>The other thing I&rsquo;d like to share, I crossed the border, it was weird crossing the border,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s this line of people looking to leave and there&rsquo;s like you with my little Starlink</p>
<p>and my little bag and my little body armor like walking across the other way, because</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t take cars across, everyone walks across.</p>
<p>And everyone&rsquo;s looking at me like I&rsquo;m crazy, because why are you walking in the other direction,</p>
<p>bro?</p>
<p>And so anyway, I walked in the other direction, had a driver pick me up, experienced a little</p>
<p>bit of western Ukraine for a few days, and I experienced what I think probably nobody</p>
<p>here has experienced directly, which is total war, right?</p>
<p>A society that&rsquo;s completely and totally mobilized to repel a foreign invader, right?</p>
<p>I was in a city called Lviv, which is one of the western cities that sort of free Ukraine,</p>
<p>and everything there is either men and weapons and trucks going east or women and children</p>
<p>and refugees going west.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all you would see.</p>
<p>All that would happen there.</p>
<p>And all of society, from the interpreter I had, because unfortunately I speak no Ukrainian,</p>
<p>to the driver who would drive me around, to the hacker I interviewed who was like DDoSing</p>
<p>Russian websites, all of them would punctuate their statements with, we will win, right?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s when I realized that the big mistake that everyone had made, I think particularly</p>
<p>in the U.S. discourse, is underrating Ukrainian resolve and their zeal for their own nationalist</p>
<p>project, right?</p>
<p>After spending a day there, and again, remember, this is the relatively early days of the war,</p>
<p>Kiev is still encircled, it wasn&rsquo;t clear if the Belarusians would start a western front,</p>
<p>it was all still up in the air, but I was starting to think, you know, I don&rsquo;t see how</p>
<p>the Russians win this, like this just seems impossible.</p>
<p>Ukraine is the size of Texas, it has a population of 40 million people, roughly the size, imagine</p>
<p>the Russians showing up with 200,000 soldiers and trying to control California, it&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>to be very difficult to do, particularly when literally everybody is staring at you and</p>
<p>saying, we will win, which is what happened.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s when I realized that this whole story was very different than it&rsquo;s being projected</p>
<p>in the United States, and that&rsquo;s, I felt vindicated in going, because I think there aren&rsquo;t that</p>
<p>many American journalists there, and I think a lot of the discourse in the U.S. tends to</p>
<p>skew towards Iraq, or towards projection of American political domestic neuroses, and</p>
<p>not the facts on the ground in Ukraine, in which you have devastated cities, you have</p>
<p>women and children refugees, you have literally a total war situation that the western world</p>
<p>hasn&rsquo;t seen since World War II.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the reality of Ukraine, and what I hope to debate here.</p>
<p>All right, thank you, Glenn.</p>
<p>Great, so I certainly have respect for anyone&rsquo;s decision to go actually see a place that you</p>
<p>want to talk about.</p>
<p>I think that there is, though, a question of how much you can actually learn about a</p>
<p>country of 44 million people with an incredibly complex history, with extreme diversity of</p>
<p>thought in terms of the population by going for whatever it is, a week or 10 days to a</p>
<p>kind of sliver of that country that has extremely different views than another region.</p>
<p>For example, if in 2003 you wanted to go before the war in Iraq and figure out what Iraqis</p>
<p>thought, if you went to the Kurdish regions of Iraq, you would hear nothing but, I want</p>
<p>the United States to come and liberate us from Saddam Hussein.</p>
<p>If you went to the Sunni triangle, you would hear, if you come, if the United States comes</p>
<p>here, we&rsquo;re going to make this a graveyard of Americans.</p>
<p>And similarly, if you go to western Ukraine, of course you&rsquo;re going to hear, we want American</p>
<p>help, we want to fight the Russians to the end.</p>
<p>If you go to the eastern regions of Ukraine, which are Russian speaking, who identify with</p>
<p>Moscow, you&rsquo;re going to hear the exact opposite.</p>
<p>So I think, you know, it&rsquo;s commendable to go to a country like Ukraine.</p>
<p>I think we have to be humble about our ability to understand the thoughts of the population,</p>
<p>the reality on the ground, when you go to certain segments that you select and that</p>
<p>are almost likely to kind of feed back to you what it is that you&rsquo;re already expecting</p>
<p>to hear.</p>
<p>The other thing I think is very important to note is that, you know, first of all, I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>a little surprised by the idea that, I guess it was implicit that Antonio felt that the</p>
<p>media narrative has been off or one-sided in the sense that it hasn&rsquo;t been favorable</p>
<p>enough to the idea that Ukraine is the victim that needs help and Russia is the clear aggressor.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t remember ever reading an article in the mainstream press since the invasion that</p>
<p>said anything other than that, which is why, you know, 80% of Americans, the entire bipartisan</p>
<p>class in Washington, of both parties, are essentially unified in support of the narrative</p>
<p>that Antonio believes, in my opinion, with great sincerity.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s been, if anything, a kind of lack of dissent available in the United</p>
<p>States on the other side.</p>
<p>And this is one thing I want to emphasize is there has been this claim, this sort of</p>
<p>implicit claim, sometimes explicit claim, that the entire war is united behind the United</p>
<p>States, behind Ukraine, against Russia.</p>
<p>The reality is, overwhelmingly, most of the world is, in fact, not united behind the United</p>
<p>States and the NATO position on Ukraine.</p>
<p>Most of the global South, 15 of the 20 most populous countries on the planet either abstained</p>
<p>or voted no when it came time to decide whether to expel Russia from the Human Rights Council.</p>
<p>And some of those countries are tyrannies.</p>
<p>Many of them, such as India, the world&rsquo;s largest democracy, Brazil, the second largest democracy</p>
<p>after the United States, very much deviates from the consensus in the United States.</p>
<p>And sometimes I think if we&rsquo;re Americans and we&rsquo;re living in a country in which we&rsquo;re bombarded</p>
<p>with one message, it&rsquo;s incumbent upon us to ask why it is that so much of the rest</p>
<p>of the world does not believe that the United States is participating in the war in Ukraine</p>
<p>with benevolent intentions or with the desire to protect democracy or protect against aggression,</p>
<p>when, in fact, the rest of the world looks at the history of the United States, not just</p>
<p>distant but very recent, and sees a country not devoted to protecting democracy but to</p>
<p>propping up tyranny, to fighting wars not to protect innocence but to sacrifice innocence</p>
<p>in its own interests.</p>
<p>And so I think that&rsquo;s one really important thing is to make sure that we&rsquo;re looking at</p>
<p>this war not as a country that&rsquo;s essentially a belligerent in it but as a country that</p>
<p>is just a small part of the rest of the world that has a lot of opinions.</p>
<p>The other thing I would point out is war in general is the worst thing that humanity can</p>
<p>unleash upon itself.</p>
<p>There is no war that doesn&rsquo;t involve extreme amounts of atrocities, extreme amounts of</p>
<p>war crimes, all kinds of hideous things.</p>
<p>And if you look at any war, any war, not just the ones that the United States adversaries</p>
<p>have started but ones that the United States has started, ones that the United States&rsquo;s</p>
<p>allies have started, that we support, you&rsquo;re going to find enormous amounts of atrocities.</p>
<p>And any decent person with any kind of a minimum moral compass who looks at any war</p>
<p>like that is going to walk away horrified and disgusted and wanting to do something</p>
<p>about it.</p>
<p>The only difference between what&rsquo;s happening in the war in Ukraine and so many other wars</p>
<p>is that the U.S. media is constantly showing us images and stories about Ukrainian victims,</p>
<p>as it should.</p>
<p>But think about the wars that the United States has itself started or is propping up, like</p>
<p>for example, the war in Yemen that has been going on for many years, that is still going</p>
<p>on because the United States is supplying Saudi Arabia, not exactly a democracy with</p>
<p>enormous amounts of weapons and money and intelligence to fight that war.</p>
<p>And think about how much you&rsquo;ve heard or seen about the victims of Yemen.</p>
<p>How many Yemenis have you heard from talking about their relatives who have been lost in</p>
<p>battle?</p>
<p>Or how many people who we bombed in wedding parties and the like have been lost as well?</p>
<p>And so I think what this can happen is it can create an imbalance in our perception.</p>
<p>The imbalance isn&rsquo;t that the war in Ukraine really isn&rsquo;t horrible, it is, but that there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>really nothing extraordinary about what&rsquo;s taking place in that war.</p>
<p>All wars, including the ones we start, the ones that we&rsquo;re waging, the ones that we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>supporting, have the same kinds of atrocities.</p>
<p>And the question ultimately becomes, does the United States really have benevolent motives</p>
<p>in trying to defend Ukraine instead of sacrifice it?</p>
<p>And secondly, does the United States have the ability to foster a positive outcome on</p>
<p>the other side of the world involving extremely complex cultures and histories and two countries</p>
<p>of very intertwined geostrategic interests that even if we did have the right motives,</p>
<p>would we really have the ability by flooding this country with weapons and all the other</p>
<p>things we typically do in wars to foster a positive outcome?</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s why the rest of the world has a lot of doubts.</p>
<p>Okay, thank you, Glenn.</p>
<p>So Glenn went on a little longer, so Antonio, why don&rsquo;t I give you a couple of minutes to</p>
<p>respond to that, and then I want to ask you both a question.</p>
<p>Okay, I think I walked into the wrong thing.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t realize we were debating Yemen instead of Ukraine, Glenn.</p>
<p>Or Indian foreign policy instead of our own.</p>
<p>One thing I would say is, one thing you said is just completely wrong.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the case that Eastern Ukraine is pro-Russian.</p>
<p>If so, how do you explain Mariupol, a city completely destroyed that fought to the last</p>
<p>man with civilians literally holing up in a steel plate?</p>
<p>How do you explain all the successes in the eastern part of the war?</p>
<p>You never actually mention the facts of the war.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re always whatabouting other countries&rsquo; reaction to the war.</p>
<p>The fact that the eastern front in Russia, that the war is going very poorly for Russia.</p>
<p>How do you explain that fact that if eastern Ukraine is actually pro-Russian, that the</p>
<p>Russians are doing so poorly there?</p>
<p>The other thing I would say, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s the fact, if you look at most polls,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s funny, this poll came out and instantly your friend Tucker Carlson as well as Jenny</p>
<p>Vance had to change their line on Ukraine because they realized that it&rsquo;s hard to be</p>
<p>a populist if your views aren&rsquo;t very popular, right?</p>
<p>AP did a poll.</p>
<p>And not just Democrats support Biden being tougher on Russian, Republicans do as well,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>And why is that?</p>
<p>Because you have a small country that&rsquo;s getting crushed by a country that&rsquo;s been the historical</p>
<p>sworn enemy of the United States as long as anyone can remember.</p>
<p>I live out in the middle of nowhere in a red state Trump country in the desert outside</p>
<p>of Reno and people are flying Ukrainian flags along with the US flags.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s because they read the New York Times, right?</p>
<p>The other&hellip;</p>
<p>So Antonio, let me ask a question.</p>
<p>So we recently had, well, previously Biden came out&hellip;</p>
<p>Can I just address one last thing there?</p>
<p>Okay, go ahead.</p>
<p>He went through several points there.</p>
<p>You know, the other thing I would say is that, you know, this and that country don&rsquo;t support</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>One thing I found, one aspect of the story that I found was very interesting was that</p>
<p>all of Europe has shown up on Ukraine&rsquo;s door to help out the Ukrainians, right?</p>
<p>Usually I&rsquo;m both EU-US citizen, usually I read both media, it&rsquo;s like the US that is</p>
<p>like the hard-line royal politik and then the EU that&rsquo;s in like geopolitical la-la land.</p>
<p>I think in the case of this story, it&rsquo;s been reversed and I think the US is taking Ukraine</p>
<p>and projecting it in its own domestic political narratives like Venice and I think the Europeans</p>
<p>actually see their own collective history in the Ukrainian story because whether it</p>
<p>be the Spanish Civil War, whether it be the Germans, they all remember what total war</p>
<p>actually means, what it is to stumble through destroyed streets and be a refugee and a displaced</p>
<p>person.</p>
<p>Americans don&rsquo;t have an experience of that, they can&rsquo;t really resonate with that, fortunately</p>
<p>for us, to be clear, but I think Europeans do.</p>
<p>So if you go to that border area, you will see all of Europe, as far away as Spain, Denmark,</p>
<p>whatever, showing up to actually help the Ukrainians.</p>
<p>The last thing I would say is, I think one thing that unites, I think, the old left that</p>
<p>you would probably put yourself in with, Glenn, like a Bernie leftist, and the new right,</p>
<p>is that both consider two key things.</p>
<p>One, the US can never act abroad in a legitimate good way.</p>
<p>Everything the US does abroad is always a fiasco and then two, everything that happens</p>
<p>abroad is our fault.</p>
<p>Literally, the entire world&rsquo;s events are downstream of a State Department phone call.</p>
<p>And I just don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>Being in Ukraine, it doesn&rsquo;t seem to me as if the US is pulling all the strings.</p>
<p>On the contrary, it seems like a very chaotic situation where the Ukrainians are trying</p>
<p>to improvise as much as they can.</p>
<p>So again, on the one hand, I reject the fact that the US can&rsquo;t act abroad.</p>
<p>Well, I think it can, if you look at things, East Asia, Japan, Korea, Western Europe itself,</p>
<p>the US has created the conditions for democracy in the past.</p>
<p>Okay, but Antonio, is there a limit to why is US involvement in Ukraine?</p>
<p>So, you know, we had Biden basically said that Putin cannot remain in power, and then</p>
<p>immediately his own press secretary walked that back as a gaffe.</p>
<p>You then had Secretary of Defense Austin say that our objective in Ukraine is not just</p>
<p>to expel the Russians, but to weaken Russia as a great power so it can never threaten</p>
<p>anyone again.</p>
<p>You then had Seth Moulton, the Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, saying</p>
<p>that we were in a proxy war with Russia.</p>
<p>And then Steny Hoyer, the House Majority Leader, said we are at war with Russia.</p>
<p>Do you think we are at war with Russia, and is that wise?</p>
<p>No, we&rsquo;re in a proxy war.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re in a proxy war with Russia.</p>
<p>What is the vital national interest of the United States that compels us to be in a war,</p>
<p>admittedly through a proxy, with Russia that has 6,000 nuclear weapons?</p>
<p>Even if I were to grant that we should be trying to, out of humanitarian motives, expel</p>
<p>the Russians from Ukraine, do you believe that we should be trying to destabilize and</p>
<p>topple Putin?</p>
<p>Let me counter that with a question.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny.</p>
<p>I feel like I&rsquo;m debating two people.</p>
<p>But like I joked in my tweet, the odds are even worse for the Ukrainians, so I&rsquo;ll take</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>But I mean, I asked you this question in Miami not too long ago, David.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re the one who said, oh, we&rsquo;re threatening World War III.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re engaging in nuclear brinkmanship.</p>
<p>By the way, things that we did all throughout the Cold War, right?</p>
<p>I was raised as an 80s kid here in Miami.</p>
<p>We used to do this thing all the time.</p>
<p>At what point would you stop?</p>
<p>At what point do you think it&rsquo;s actually worth rolling the dice?</p>
<p>At what point between Lviv and Warsaw and your front door would you stop and say, actually,</p>
<p>World War III and nuclear war is worth risking?</p>
<p>Because that&rsquo;s an answer I don&rsquo;t get out of the appeasers.</p>
<p>At what point do you actually put your foot down?</p>
<p>Well, I mean, look, what I&rsquo;ve said is that I&rsquo;m willing to arm Ukraine under Cold War</p>
<p>rules, i.e. the way that we armed the mujahideen in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>So we provided them with stingers, but it wasn&rsquo;t a U.S. flag on the box, and we didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>draw, you know, it wasn&rsquo;t U.S. flags on the trucks.</p>
<p>There were a certain set of rules by which we engaged in to avoid the risk of World</p>
<p>War III with the Russians.</p>
<p>Do you feel that&rsquo;s not the case now?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s‚Äîno, because we have now defined our objectives in a much more expansive way.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll let Glenn speak for himself, because I think he would not go as far as me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sort of in‚ÄîI&rsquo;m willing to do a little bit more.</p>
<p>But no.</p>
<p>I mean, look, you have the president of the United States saying that he wants to basically</p>
<p>topple Putin.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got Austin saying that our objectives here go beyond Ukraine.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s basically to kick Russia out of the League of Great Powers.</p>
<p>And moreover, you&rsquo;ve got the State Department declaring that we&rsquo;re in a global struggle</p>
<p>between autocracy and democracy.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve defined the struggle in Manichaean terms, and if somehow Ukraine were to lose,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s like this domino theory where dictators are going to take over the whole globe.</p>
<p>And so I think we&rsquo;ve invested‚ÄîI would give them some help, but I would not allow</p>
<p>the‚Äîwe‚Äîno American president has ever claimed that the United States has a vital</p>
<p>national interest in Ukraine, not even the president who&rsquo;s done it before.</p>
<p>Maybe‚Äî</p>
<p>In fact, can I just make a point about that?</p>
<p>Go ahead, Glenn.</p>
<p>So, first of all, at the start of every war that we fought over the last 60 years, the</p>
<p>same climate if we were in the United States would prevail as the one that&rsquo;s in this</p>
<p>room.</p>
<p>Every time some comment was made that the United States is on the right side, we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>actually doing the right thing, we&rsquo;re fighting on behalf of everybody in the auditorium,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;d woo, applaud.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really good.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good feeling to feel like your country, your government is doing something deeply</p>
<p>moral.</p>
<p>So, again, I just want to show‚Äîand maybe, you know, this doesn&rsquo;t matter because you</p>
<p>think that most other countries are primitive or arrogant or immersed in propaganda, and</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>But here are the top 20 countries by population, and the ones in yellow are the ones who refused</p>
<p>to support the U.N. resolution expelling Russia from the U.N. Human Rights Council.</p>
<p>And you can see that it&rsquo;s nine out of the ten most populous countries that are on the</p>
<p>opposite side of all the cheering that&rsquo;s taking place in this auditorium.</p>
<p>This is exactly what has repeated itself every time we&rsquo;ve gone to war, in Vietnam, in Iraq,</p>
<p>in Afghanistan, in Libya, in Syria.</p>
<p>All Americans across the board, 80 percent, 85 percent, are on board with the war in the</p>
<p>beginning because it feels so good to believe your country is going to war to do something</p>
<p>positive, and then six months later or a year later or five years later, every single one</p>
<p>of those wars, overwhelming majorities say it was a huge mistake.</p>
<p>That at least to me would cause some humility to ask, why does that pattern keep repeating</p>
<p>itself?</p>
<p>Why am I, as an American, always so susceptible to cheering my government&rsquo;s involvement in</p>
<p>a war when the rest of the world is telling you that actually you&rsquo;re being propagandized,</p>
<p>that the motive the United States government is claiming to have, which is defending democracy,</p>
<p>is not actually their motive, as illustrated by, I don&rsquo;t know why the rule is we&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>allowed to evaluate other things the United States is doing to determine whether those</p>
<p>motives are real, like what we do in Saudi Arabia or what we do in Yemen.</p>
<p>It seems like if someone comes to you and claims that they&rsquo;re acting with a certain</p>
<p>motive to determine whether that&rsquo;s really the motive, you&rsquo;d want to look at the history</p>
<p>of that person and whether their behavior is consistent with that motive.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what the rest of the world is doing, and the reason why they find these propagandistic</p>
<p>claims of the United States so preposterous, because so many of them have been victimized</p>
<p>by the United States overthrowing their democratically elected governments, not in the distant past</p>
<p>but in the recent ones, here&rsquo;s the next ten most populous countries, six out of ten also</p>
<p>deviates from the U.S. position.</p>
<p>And then as far as what David was saying, this was Barack Obama, so it&rsquo;s not what Antonio</p>
<p>was saying, people on the far left, my friend Tucker Carlson, evil far-right people.</p>
<p>This is Barack Obama in 2016 on his way out the door.</p>
<p>He was confronted in a very lengthy interview by Jeffrey Goldberg, the neoconservative editor</p>
<p>in chief of The Atlantic, who probably did more than anybody else to convince Americans</p>
<p>to support the war in Iraq in 2002 and 2003 by claiming that Al-Qaeda was in an alliance</p>
<p>with Saddam Hussein, and he was demanding to know why Obama spent his presidency refusing</p>
<p>to arm the Ukrainians and refusing to confront Moscow.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s what Jeffrey Goldberg in 2016 quoted Obama as saying, this is Goldberg&rsquo;s quote</p>
<p>for Obama, quote, Obama&rsquo;s theory here is simple.</p>
<p>Ukraine is a core Russian interest but not an American one, so Russia will always be</p>
<p>able to maintain escalatory dominance there.</p>
<p>Quote, the fact is that Ukraine, which is a non-NATO country, is going to be vulnerable</p>
<p>to military domination by Russia no matter what we do.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s realistic, but this is an example of where we have to be very clear about what</p>
<p>our core interests are and what we are willing to go to war for.</p>
<p>And then here is the current CIA director, William Burns, who&rsquo;s also not on the far left</p>
<p>or part of the far right, who in 2008, in a memo to Condoleezza Rice when the Bush administration</p>
<p>wanted to expand NATO up to Russian borders, warned, this is what he wrote, quote, Ukrainian</p>
<p>entry into NATO is the brightest of all red lines for the Russian elite, not just Putin.</p>
<p>In more than two and a half years of conversations with key Russian players, from knuckle draggers</p>
<p>in the dark recesses of the Kremlin to Putin&rsquo;s sharpest liberal critics, I have yet to find</p>
<p>anyone who views Ukraine and NATO as anything other than a direct challenge to Russian interests.</p>
<p>This has been conventional wisdom in Washington up until February 24th when it suddenly became</p>
<p>taboo to talk about.</p>
<p>Russia views Ukraine as the most vital interest to it because it was twice used by Germany</p>
<p>to invade Russia in the 20th century and virtually destroy it, and that Ukraine never has been</p>
<p>and never will be a vital interest to the United States.</p>
<p>Okay, Glenn, let&rsquo;s go to Antonio.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s give him a chance.</p>
<p>Okay, Glenn, I think that argument sounded better in the original Russian, to be honest.</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t know why you&rsquo;re sitting here citing six-year-old Atlantic pieces about</p>
<p>Obama.</p>
<p>Are you going to address the reality of what we&rsquo;re talking about?</p>
<p>In that list of nations, by the way, you included such human rights luminaries as Iran and China</p>
<p>as having voted against it.</p>
<p>Let me ask you a direct question.</p>
<p>Should Russia be sitting on the UN Human Rights Council, a country that routinely incarcerates</p>
<p>journalists and has a heinous human rights record?</p>
<p>I mean, if you look at who else is on the Human Rights Council, like the United States,</p>
<p>a country that still has Guantanamo‚Äî</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re always whatabouting, Glenn.</p>
<p>Just answer the question.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s not whataboutism to say you have to look at what the rest of the world is doing</p>
<p>in order to understand the moral framework.</p>
<p>Why is it that the United States, that still has people on Guantanamo for 20 years with</p>
<p>no trial, that destroyed the country of Iraq, a country of 25 million people that created</p>
<p>the worst humanitarian crisis in Yemen, that is imprisoning journalists like Julian Assange</p>
<p>with no charges for over a decade now, has any moral credibility to say we are morally</p>
<p>superior?</p>
<p>I know it feels good to say that, but the reality is the United States, if you look</p>
<p>at what it&rsquo;s actually doing, which is going around the world, and it&rsquo;s always done this,</p>
<p>supporting tyranny, not supporting democracy, propping up despots, not fighting them.</p>
<p>If you want to believe that there&rsquo;s a way to go into Ukraine and defend the Ukrainians</p>
<p>and all of that, I believe that that&rsquo;s what you want to do, but it would be incredibly</p>
<p>naive to refuse to ask ourselves whether that&rsquo;s really the goal of the United States, given</p>
<p>everything we know about the government.</p>
<p>And if the goal of the United States is not the benevolent one that you hope they have</p>
<p>and that you have, but instead is a different one, namely not to defend Ukraine and Ukrainians,</p>
<p>but to sacrifice Ukraine in pursuit of this broader geopolitical goal that David mentioned</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re now admitting, which is to weaken Russia and bring about regime change, then</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re cheering for a war that is completely different than the war that is actually being</p>
<p>fought.</p>
<p>No, I disagree.</p>
<p>And I think you&rsquo;ve spent too long in Plato&rsquo;s cave of Twitter, and you don&rsquo;t stare at reality</p>
<p>anymore, to be quite honest.</p>
<p>None of what I showed you came from Twitter.</p>
<p>Excuse me, excuse me.</p>
<p>None of what I just showed you came from Twitter.</p>
<p>Yeah, no.</p>
<p>It came from the six-year-old Atlantic piece.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s even less relevant.</p>
<p>Just this week, the Finnish and Swedish parliaments voted to join NATO.</p>
<p>Why is that?</p>
<p>Your argument is completely backwards.</p>
<p>Russia&rsquo;s not aggressive.</p>
<p>Hold on a second.</p>
<p>Let me finish the thought.</p>
<p>No, hold on.</p>
<p>Let me respond to the point that you sat there for two minutes staring at.</p>
<p>Russia&rsquo;s not surrounded by NATO.</p>
<p>Russia isn&rsquo;t aggressive because it&rsquo;s surrounded by NATO.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s surrounded by NATO because it&rsquo;s aggressive, okay?</p>
<p>And countries like Finland and Sweden have been living under the Russian boot, and Finland</p>
<p>most of all knows it from the Winter War, and that threat has been there constantly.</p>
<p>So again, what do you know that the Finnish and Swedish parliaments, who are trying to</p>
<p>make a decision for their people, don&rsquo;t know, right?</p>
<p>If I were a country and I had the option to have the richest and most powerful country</p>
<p>with the biggest military, tell me that if anyone invades you, I&rsquo;m going to go into war</p>
<p>and fight against you.</p>
<p>I would say, yeah, I would love that also.</p>
<p>That sounds like a really great thing.</p>
<p>Of course every country would love to have a pledge from the world&rsquo;s greatest military</p>
<p>that if anyone attacks you‚Äî Are you seriously saying that countries would</p>
<p>line up to be Ukraine?</p>
<p>What do you know about the United States&rsquo; intentions that all of the countries I just</p>
<p>showed you, not including tyrannies, many of which are on the United States&rsquo; side,</p>
<p>but many democracies who have had their democracies subverted by the United States, who are saying,</p>
<p>we do not believe the United States is well-intentioned, that every time the United States involves</p>
<p>itself in a war, it convinces its own citizens that it&rsquo;s going to do benevolent things.</p>
<p>But the reality is exactly the opposite.</p>
<p>What do you know that the entire rest of the world doesn&rsquo;t?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the entire rest of the world.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a huge part of it.</p>
<p>The Europeans who are close to the conflict completely disagree with you.</p>
<p>The Danes, the cuddly little Danes, are ceding lethal aid to Ukraine.</p>
<p>For sure.</p>
<p>My own country, the Spanish are.</p>
<p>The U.S. and Europeans are on your side.</p>
<p>Let me shift gears.</p>
<p>I want to get to another aspect of this topic.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s start with you, Antonio.</p>
<p>What is the outcome that you would like to see here?</p>
<p>And right now, the way that victory is being defined by Ukraine and by our State Department</p>
<p>is that we kick Russia out of Ukraine, maybe even Crimea too, that&rsquo;s the official policy,</p>
<p>and maybe we destabilize and topple Putin.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the outcome that you think our objective should be here?</p>
<p>My ideal outcome is whatever the Ukrainians want for themselves, which seems to be, if</p>
<p>you listen to them, seems to be a liberal democratic Ukraine that wants to join the</p>
<p>greater EU Western sphere.</p>
<p>If you look at the Maidan protests in 2015, this is when everyone kind of revolted against</p>
<p>the pro-Russian leader at the time, and there were civilian shootings.</p>
<p>And if you talk to Ukrainians, I mean, there&rsquo;s been 200 years or longer of Ukrainian sort</p>
<p>of nationalism kind of brewing, but the 2014-2015 protests were really a formative period where</p>
<p>the Ukrainians really said, this is it.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got our own country.</p>
<p>And if you talk to them, they&rsquo;re like, we&rsquo;ve had seven years of democracy.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not giving it up now, right?</p>
<p>And if you look at things like the mass graves discovered at Buko, when the Russians pulled</p>
<p>back, they look at that and they say, if we fail, that&rsquo;s the future that awaits us,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>So they want the opposite of that.</p>
<p>Apparently, 80 to 90 percent of the population in Crimea is Russian and wants to be part</p>
<p>of Russia.</p>
<p>Does that go back to Ukraine or does that go to Russia?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good question.</p>
<p>But the Ukrainians under Zelensky believe that Crimea belongs to them.</p>
<p>So is he wrong about that?</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t the principle of self-determination mean that those peoples should get to decide</p>
<p>which country they go with?</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s as much a question for Crimea as it is Catalonia and Spain.</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;re asking me to speak for Zelensky?</p>
<p>But the Russians have a naval base at Sevastopol that gives them control over the Black Sea.</p>
<p>And if you tell them that what Ukrainian victory means here is they get kicked out of that</p>
<p>naval base and lose control of the Black Sea, you have threatened them existentially.</p>
<p>And you know their policy with regard to nuclear weapons is it&rsquo;s allowed if their nation is</p>
<p>existentially threatened.</p>
<p>So we are playing with fire here.</p>
<p>Is that an objective that we are willing to risk a nuclear war for?</p>
<p>As we did in Cuba with nuclear weapons there.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think we should be.</p>
<p>So we need to define our objectives here in a more limited way than just whatever the</p>
<p>Ukrainians say.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s the reality, right?</p>
<p>Again, this is one of the things when you get into American political discourse.</p>
<p>Everything isn&rsquo;t downstream of an American decision.</p>
<p>This will come down to the fortunes of war on the ground in Ukraine, which is partially</p>
<p>a function of how much aid we give them, obviously.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>But it springs on those weapons, right?</p>
<p>Forty billion of weapons are going there and it&rsquo;s just this month&rsquo;s delivery.</p>
<p>So I mean&hellip;</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a good question to ask what happens to those weapons after, which I&rsquo;m sure is</p>
<p>a concern for Glenn as well.</p>
<p>Do you believe our State Department is working for a negotiated peace?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know the inner workings of the State Department.</p>
<p>But should they be?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>I think the war stops and the Ukrainians want it to stop.</p>
<p>Glenn, your view on that?</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s so many countries all over the world who want the United States to do</p>
<p>things that we don&rsquo;t do for them.</p>
<p>The Yemenis have been begging the United States for six years to stop sending huge amounts</p>
<p>of weaponry and intelligence to the Saudis.</p>
<p>And you can say, oh yeah, Yemen&rsquo;s a totally different country.</p>
<p>Yemen&rsquo;s a different country, but it&rsquo;s still the United States government.</p>
<p>And it is extremely disturbing to me, I have to say, that we suddenly seem to care so much</p>
<p>about the lives of Ukrainians and seem to care very little about the lives of all the</p>
<p>countries in which we ourselves are the aggressors.</p>
<p>And you can say, well, that&rsquo;s a completely different issue.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not a completely different issue, because what the outcome is of the United</p>
<p>States&rsquo; role in Ukraine is determined by the U.S. motive.</p>
<p>And what you have to do to look at what the U.S. motive is, is not pick the rhetoric that</p>
<p>makes you feel good.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re on the side of liberation.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what George Bush said in his 2003 State of the Union speech.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to Iraq because we love democracy, and we&rsquo;re going to liberate the Iraqi people</p>
<p>from Saddam Hussein.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what Lyndon Johnson said about why we&rsquo;re getting involved in the war in Vietnam.</p>
<p>We love the South Vietnamese Democrats, and we&rsquo;re going there to protect them from the</p>
<p>South Vietnamese communists.</p>
<p>Maybe if that had been true, those wars would have had much different outcomes.</p>
<p>But that wasn&rsquo;t the reason.</p>
<p>That was the propagandistic pretense.</p>
<p>And so to refuse to say, I&rsquo;m going to interrogate the authenticity of what U.S. motives are,</p>
<p>is to just wash your hands of the reality of the war instead of what you hope the war</p>
<p>is.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s give Antonio the last word.</p>
<p>Yeah, OK.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to give you the last word.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to give Antonio the last word, since he was a little bit outgunned here.</p>
<p>Not outgunned, because you did more than fine on your own, but there was a little bit of</p>
<p>two on one.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re going to give Antonio the last word.</p>
<p>David, what were you guys talking about?</p>
<p>Italy, apparently.</p>
<p>Or Yemen, apparently.</p>
<p>But anyhow.</p>
<p>So when I was coming back from Ukraine, and I was crossing back, and suddenly I was, obviously</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t really a refugee, but I was in the refugee line along with all the other Ukrainians</p>
<p>leaving.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re at the border.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the middle of nowhere, by the way.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like a big city or anything.</p>
<p>And you saw a sign in Polish that said, you&rsquo;re entering Poland, and the EU flag, right?</p>
<p>Now, as an EU citizen, that flag never really meant much to me.</p>
<p>And again, not that my time in Ukraine was that bad.</p>
<p>But it did feel precarious, and it was a war zone, and sirens going off, and all that stuff.</p>
<p>To go back to what seemed like an ordered, liberal world seemed magical to me.</p>
<p>I had the same feeling.</p>
<p>I went to report on Cuba on the internet years ago for Wired Magazine, and when I landed</p>
<p>at Miami Airport here, it was like, man, God bless America.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad to be back here.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a certain order and rules to life.</p>
<p>I think the global liberal order is real, and I think those who tend to shit on it,</p>
<p>or at least question its value, are those that typically tend not to live outside of</p>
<p>it, for one, and undervalue its importance in the world.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, a debate for the ages.</p>
<p>Well done.</p>
