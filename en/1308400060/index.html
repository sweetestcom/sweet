    <p>Hi friends! So I figured it&rsquo;s time that I be honest with you and I&rsquo;m gonna tell</p>
<p>you the whole story about how I gained over 860,000 followers on TikTok in less</p>
<p>than two years. I&rsquo;m gonna tell you the full background of what was going on</p>
<p>with me and then why I started on TikTok, how I blew up, and how I still blow up</p>
<p>consistently. There&rsquo;s a lot of shit that&rsquo;s gone on that y&rsquo;all don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>about that I need to tell you about because I&rsquo;m all about like self</p>
<p>development, self growth, and all this shit. So I wanted to share everything</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve been through because it&rsquo;s a lot and I really think it will help a</p>
<p>lot of you but goddamn am I anxious about this episode because it&rsquo;s about a</p>
<p>lot more people than just me. So let&rsquo;s just jump into this. I&rsquo;m gonna tell you</p>
<p>about my TikTok from the fucking birth of it and we&rsquo;re just gonna see where it</p>
<p>goes from there. I have notes in front of me to like keep me on track with the</p>
<p>whole story and everything that&rsquo;s happened but it&rsquo;s a lot. So I had a</p>
<p>TikTok account like everybody does where you just kind of like don&rsquo;t post and</p>
<p>then you do fuck around and you eventually like do just post and you</p>
<p>start posting like little random bullshit. That&rsquo;s what I was doing and I</p>
<p>was kind of like just fucking around with my TikTok. Nothing on my account blew up. I</p>
<p>just want to start that from there. Like it wasn&rsquo;t an accident how I started</p>
<p>growing on social media and I want to make that very clear. It was very</p>
<p>strategic and like Alana Del Rey says, if I said I didn&rsquo;t plan for it to turn</p>
<p>out this way I&rsquo;d be lying. So what was going on with me at the time was I had</p>
<p>just left an ex of mine and I was going through the worst breakup you can</p>
<p>fucking imagine and the reason I left this ex was because of disrespect. There</p>
<p>was a lot of shit that went on and I don&rsquo;t care how much money you have, how</p>
<p>great you are, who you are. I do not tolerate disrespect and I tolerated too</p>
<p>fucking much of it and I hit my breaking point and I was like Leo who the fuck</p>
<p>are you? Like remember who you are and I bounced. I did everything I could to make</p>
<p>it work. I put up with a lot of shit but I just want to say tolerating things in</p>
<p>a relationship that you&rsquo;re not okay with, it&rsquo;s never gonna go well. Don&rsquo;t try and</p>
<p>convince yourself to be okay with shit you&rsquo;re not okay with. Fucking bounce. Get</p>
<p>the hell out of there. But this person I was dating was very well off financially.</p>
<p>Like he had a lot of money and I&rsquo;m mentioning this because it is a key part</p>
<p>and a really big like contributor to what the fuck happened after I left. But</p>
<p>basically I touched a lifestyle and got access to money I had always fucking</p>
<p>dreamed of. I&rsquo;ve never been more unhappy in my life and I&rsquo;ll do a whole podcast</p>
<p>episode about that. About like voids money can&rsquo;t fill and I&rsquo;m also gonna do a</p>
<p>podcast episode about how money does make you happy. I&rsquo;m gonna have to play</p>
<p>devil&rsquo;s advocate for both sides. But basically I got to a point in this</p>
<p>relationship the money didn&rsquo;t fucking matter. Like it was cool, it was cute but</p>
<p>I just wanted out and the disrespect is the thing that I fucking ran from. I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t tolerate that shit like I said. Like I don&rsquo;t give a fuck if you&rsquo;re the</p>
<p>goddamn Pope. Eat shit. You got to understand something about people who</p>
<p>have money and it&rsquo;s that they get what the fuck they want and if they can&rsquo;t get</p>
<p>it they&rsquo;ll find a way to buy it or help it. Like I don&rsquo;t know how to explain it.</p>
<p>Like they get what the fuck they want and they buy ways to get it and even if</p>
<p>they can&rsquo;t buy a direct way to get it they&rsquo;ll be able to pay for some aspect</p>
<p>of it. People with money are just used to getting their fucking way and when I</p>
<p>left this person there was no getting me back. Once you push me to that point</p>
<p>where I&rsquo;m ready to say fuck you and I leave, you disrespect me to the point</p>
<p>where I have to leave. It&rsquo;s my self-concept or you. There is no getting</p>
<p>me back. There is no second chance. There is no fix it. So I was dealing with a</p>
<p>person who&rsquo;s used to getting what he wants not having to deal with loss and I</p>
<p>was the thing that he lost. I don&rsquo;t think he could handle losing me. Honestly I&rsquo;d</p>
<p>be upset if I lost somebody like me too. But like I said people with money are</p>
<p>used to getting their fucking way but it was it was more than just that. Like he</p>
<p>got finally the love he had always looked for in life. Like he got to</p>
<p>experience what it&rsquo;s like to truly be loved and cared for and that&rsquo;s a big</p>
<p>thing with someone like me. Like when I love someone or care about someone</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re never fucking finding that again. You&rsquo;re not getting it twice. And I was</p>
<p>the thing he had always wanted. I met the needs for him he didn&rsquo;t know he fucking</p>
<p>had. I lost myself because I didn&rsquo;t know how to fucking do a relationship back</p>
<p>then but I became everything he ever wanted and everything he ever needed. So</p>
<p>for him to get to experience that great. Best thing ever. And then to lose it ah</p>
<p>bitch I would lose my fucking mind too. But people have a weird way of coping</p>
<p>with losing things and especially people. A lot of people have to justify losing</p>
<p>someone or losing something. So they&rsquo;ll need to discredit what it was. It wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>as good as I thought it was. Or they need to paint the person out to be evil so</p>
<p>they feel good about losing them. Like he was trying to convince himself that</p>
<p>what he got from me was not real. It was not true. I was a liar. I was a fucking</p>
<p>manipulator. I was all this and all that. Motherfucker you can&rsquo;t fake the way that</p>
<p>I love people okay. But basically me leaving him put him at war with himself</p>
<p>because he was trying so hard to make me out to be the fucking bad guy and he</p>
<p>just couldn&rsquo;t. Because the way that I cared about him was so fucking genuine</p>
<p>and I handled every situation right. It wasn&rsquo;t about the fucking money and it</p>
<p>was obvious. And so many situations explained that and exposed that and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like people can&rsquo;t just sit with the fact that they fucked something up. They need</p>
<p>someone else to be the problem and someone else to take the responsibility</p>
<p>of that. They can&rsquo;t handle it. So he tried to make me out to be the bad guy. He had</p>
<p>to like convince himself I was evil and I was fucked up. So he felt good about</p>
<p>what he did to me and what he did was try to fucking destroy me. And he did. He</p>
<p>did fucking destroy me and my entire life. And that entire experience is a big</p>
<p>key component to how I am the way that I am and why I am the way that I am. And</p>
<p>all the mental like strength I have now because I was broken down to nothing. So</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m from Florida. That&rsquo;s where all my family&rsquo;s at. I lived in Florida. Grew up</p>
<p>in Florida. And I moved to Atlanta Georgia to be with this person. And when</p>
<p>I left him I moved back home to live with my dad. And that was a mindfuck of</p>
<p>its own to go from spending like a hundred thousand dollars a month on just</p>
<p>whatever, traveling the world, doing whatever the fuck I want, eating at the</p>
<p>best places, buying the nicest shit, to choosing back into going to work as a</p>
<p>nurse. Because I&rsquo;m a nurse. A lot of people don&rsquo;t know that. I graduated as a</p>
<p>nurse, an RN, at 21 years old. So I chose out of that lifestyle, out of respect for</p>
<p>myself, to go back and take on working to only make like three to four thousand</p>
<p>dollars a month. And that was a huge mindfuck that I&rsquo;m gonna talk about in</p>
<p>the money episode. Like going from those extremes of lifestyles without something</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very good at. And that&rsquo;s why you can&rsquo;t sway my character with money or</p>
<p>anything. Because I&rsquo;m able to bounce back and forth. I&rsquo;m able to adapt very well.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been up and down in lifestyles before and I have no problem doing it</p>
<p>again. But that lifestyle is something I never touched. Like that level of money,</p>
<p>when I left that shit, that was so fucking hard. Because when you have that</p>
<p>lifestyle, you get to escape a lot of fear and worry. And what am I gonna do</p>
<p>with my life? All that&rsquo;s solved for you. Because you don&rsquo;t have to fucking think about it.</p>
<p>So when I chose to come back home and like rip myself out of that lifestyle</p>
<p>and put myself back into like reality of like a normal working person, I chose</p>
<p>that shit and I did it. But that alone is enough to fuck someone up mentally. So</p>
<p>now I&rsquo;m gonna tell you what the fuck he did after that. But when I moved back</p>
<p>home with my dad and started working again, I was fucking harassed like you</p>
<p>cannot believe, bitch. Like anything you can make up for a fucking movie happened.</p>
<p>Like I should write a book on this shit. But I really don&rsquo;t want to give people</p>
<p>ideas of like how to hurt someone because what he did to me is</p>
<p>unforgivable. And I will be mad about that until the end of time. Like I&rsquo;ll be</p>
<p>in hell fucking burning and just stewing with the fucking hatred I have.</p>
<p>I do have a lot of like compassion. A little. Fuck you. Fuck you for what the</p>
<p>fuck you did to me. I don&rsquo;t believe in forgiveness. I don&rsquo;t deal with that shit.</p>
<p>You did what you did. It fucked me up the way that it did. I am who I am now</p>
<p>because of it. But still, fuck you till the day I die. I do look back and I have</p>
<p>like my soft heart moments where I&rsquo;m like appreciative of certain things and</p>
<p>I thought I missed certain things. But me ever having a conversation with this</p>
<p>person and ever saying thank you for what they did for me is so destroyed. The</p>
<p>entire potential of it is destroyed by what the fuck they caused and what they</p>
<p>did to my life. So the biggest thing that happened when I said I was going through</p>
<p>all the harassment shit, I was working as a nurse. And when you&rsquo;re a nurse you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>licensed by the state that you live in. So I was licensed by the state of</p>
<p>Florida. So this person, him and his mom, concocted a fucking plan and reported me</p>
<p>to the Florida Board of Nursing and submitted false claims against me and</p>
<p>said that my license needs to be terminated and revoked. The Florida</p>
<p>Board of Nursing has to investigate any claims that are made. Like they have to</p>
<p>see if it&rsquo;s true or not. You know? It&rsquo;s not that you&rsquo;re like guilty or you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>innocent. It&rsquo;s like this claim, okay we need to assess it. So they launched a</p>
<p>full investigation on me for six months to figure out if these claims were true</p>
<p>or not and my license was on the line the entire time. But your license doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>go inactive just because someone submits a claim. So I was still able to work as a</p>
<p>nurse but this person started calling the company that I worked for and was</p>
<p>harassing the fuck out of them. Was making all these false claims with them</p>
<p>was threatening to sue them because they still employed me. He was trying to</p>
<p>get me fired. He was doing the most fucked up shit you can imagine but he</p>
<p>also sent pictures of me. Nude photos that I had sent to him when we were in a</p>
<p>relationship. He sent my fucking nudes to my boss and to every email in my office</p>
<p>of my company I worked for. So everyone I worked for saw my fucking dick and he</p>
<p>was trying to say that I was taking nudes while at work and sending them to</p>
<p>him and I need to be fired for it. And he was also saying that I was taking</p>
<p>pictures of patients and like sending their addresses. I fucking never would</p>
<p>you dumb shit. I&rsquo;m too fucking smart for that. Like one, I care about people too</p>
<p>much to violate fucking HIPAA. But two, you think I&rsquo;m fucking stupid enough to</p>
<p>violate HIPAA? They will come down on you like a ton of bricks. Hell no. But</p>
<p>basically he was just trying to ruin my fucking character and he caused so much</p>
<p>headache with the company that I worked for that they didn&rsquo;t fire me but they</p>
<p>asked me to go inactive. Which means like not work. So it&rsquo;s not that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>fired. You&rsquo;re still an employee but I&rsquo;m not an active employee. You just go</p>
<p>inactive. So I wasn&rsquo;t working while the investigation was going on and to get</p>
<p>this motherfucker to stop because he was fucking with the company not just me. And</p>
<p>there was so much more happening than just this but I was so excited because I</p>
<p>was in contact with attorneys. I was in contact with the fucking police many</p>
<p>times because of the extent of the harassment I was under. But everything</p>
<p>was dismissed because it was like just under the law. Like nothing broke the law.</p>
<p>So I was finally like yes finally you do something where I can get your fucking</p>
<p>ass arrested you little bitch. Because it&rsquo;s one thing if you want to come to me</p>
<p>and have a fucking problem let&rsquo;s have a problem. If you want to fight let&rsquo;s fight.</p>
<p>If you want to fucking try and kill each other let&rsquo;s do it. But for you to fuck</p>
<p>with me in ways where I can&rsquo;t protect myself and because you have money you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna abuse it. I don&rsquo;t fuck with that. So I don&rsquo;t like calling cops. I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>like doing that shit. But I had no fucking choice. Like bitch wouldn&rsquo;t come</p>
<p>to my face and I couldn&rsquo;t find him. Motherfucker kept fleeing the country</p>
<p>because he knew if I got my hands on him he&rsquo;s toast. And my my life was at a point</p>
<p>back then where I had nothing to lose. He had taken it all. So going to prison for</p>
<p>murder was not an issue for me. I had nothing to fucking lose. The potential</p>
<p>for my life was gone. It was fucking ruined. So I was excited that he finally</p>
<p>sent my nudes. Because I was like now you&rsquo;re getting arrested you punk fuck.</p>
<p>Nope. And I tried to put in a fucking report. And the cops basically said that</p>
<p>the way that he sent my nudes was out of concern. That I had violated some shit in</p>
<p>my company. So it&rsquo;s different if he just sent my nudes to someone like his friend</p>
<p>or something. But he sent them to my company. Sent them to everyone in it. But</p>
<p>because it was showing concern it&rsquo;s not illegal. So this motherfucker again was</p>
<p>just under the law. And I&rsquo;m over here just left to fucking be embarrassed and</p>
<p>have no way to defend myself. So I considered okay I&rsquo;ll just go get a job</p>
<p>at a different place while I&rsquo;m under investigation. He won&rsquo;t know where I</p>
<p>work at the new place. So like I&rsquo;ll be fine from this. You know like I can still</p>
<p>make some money live and be fine. And then this motherfucker bought</p>
<p>leoskeppy.com and made a full website with embarrassing ass pictures of me.</p>
<p>And fucking ripped me. Made up fucking lies. Made up fucking stories. Literally</p>
<p>plastered anything bad he could about me to try and ruin me and ruin my name.</p>
<p>Because what this does when I was gonna go look for a new job. The first thing</p>
<p>new employers do is fucking Google you. The first thing that comes up with</p>
<p>leoskeppy.com. So it inhibited my ability to get another job. And it was</p>
<p>like checkmate. Like what the fuck am I supposed to do financially you know. So</p>
<p>luckily I just started working for my dad. He&rsquo;s got his own business. He does</p>
<p>fine. But like I didn&rsquo;t want to fucking do that. Like I fucking have no interest</p>
<p>in that shit. And I went to school so I never had to go work for my dad. I went</p>
<p>to school and became a nurse so I could have my own branch off in life. I could</p>
<p>go do something separate and support myself and be okay. And that was fucking</p>
<p>taken from me. So I ended up right where I fucking avoided being. Which is working</p>
<p>for my fucking dad. Went through three and a half years of school for fucking</p>
<p>nothing at this point. Because I&rsquo;m right where the fuck I didn&rsquo;t want to be. Like</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m right where I started. So I start working for my dad because it&rsquo;s the only</p>
<p>place I can get a fucking job. And I&rsquo;m fucking dealing cards on the side.</p>
<p>Because fuck this shit. Like the system is not here to help you. The justice</p>
<p>system is a bunch of horseshit. And I was attacked from every angle. I had no</p>
<p>other option I saw at the time. So I did what the fuck I had to do. I literally</p>
<p>looked at my life like it was ruined. And I was in such a point of hopelessness</p>
<p>and just fucking despair over everything. Like you can only imagine where the fuck</p>
<p>I was at mentally and emotionally. And that&rsquo;s when the suicidal tendencies and</p>
<p>the suicidal ideations and all that started for me. I hit that fucking point.</p>
<p>And hung out there for a goddamn while. I got comfortable in it. It was like my</p>
<p>sense of normal. And I&rsquo;ll make another episode about how to get out of</p>
<p>suicidal thoughts and like deal with all of that. I&rsquo;m just trying to make sure I</p>
<p>execute that episode very very very good. That&rsquo;s a slippery slope bitch. And I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t want to get caught up in no fuck shit. So I can give you the real life</p>
<p>things that I learned from being in that place. And staying in it. And feeling</p>
<p>stuck in it. And this was my little phase where all I did was fucking party. I</p>
<p>would work Monday to Friday. And then I would go out and get so blacked out</p>
<p>fucked up on the weekends. I didn&rsquo;t know who I was and what was going on in my</p>
<p>life. That&rsquo;s when I started doing extracurriculars and rolling my ass off.</p>
<p>Because I didn&rsquo;t want to feel what I felt. And I looked at it like there was</p>
<p>no fucking point. Like my life was ruined. It&rsquo;s done. Who gives a shit? Might as</p>
<p>well go have a little fun if you fucking can. You know? I escaped. Like I had to</p>
<p>spend a big period of my life coping to escape what I was dealing with. Because</p>
<p>I was in court too. And I&rsquo;m about to get into when I started my account. So I</p>
<p>started the username on TikTok not Leo for legal reasons. And the reason I</p>
<p>picked that name is because I was going through court. The motherfucker. All the</p>
<p>shit he was doing. He was also suing me in court. And making up all these fucking</p>
<p>cases he could make against me. Try to get a restraining order on me. Try to</p>
<p>fucking sue me for multiple different things. Just to drag me through court.</p>
<p>Because court is very expensive. And I didn&rsquo;t have money to hire an attorney. So</p>
<p>this motherfucker just wanted to ruin me mentally. Which he did for a while. And</p>
<p>drag me through fucking court. So I couldn&rsquo;t stop thinking about him. He was</p>
<p>still in my life. And I couldn&rsquo;t get away from it. Like it was literally like the</p>
<p>worst fucking shit. And I hate court. I hate everything to do with court. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not about who&rsquo;s right and wrong. And who&rsquo;s good and who&rsquo;s bad. And who did</p>
<p>wrong and who did bad. It&rsquo;s about their fucking little rules and their little</p>
<p>laws. And if you know how to skate around them you can get away with so much shit.</p>
<p>And a judge will literally look at you in your fucking face. And let the other</p>
<p>person go who has ruined you. The justice system is not for justice. And I&rsquo;m gonna</p>
<p>leave it at that. So basically I picked the name Not Leo for legal reasons.</p>
<p>Because I was going through court. And I was like I don&rsquo;t want anything I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>posting or doing to be able to be brought up in court. So Not Leo for legal</p>
<p>reasons. Fuck ya. Try and pull it up. It ain&rsquo;t me. But I started to like post</p>
<p>videos on there. Because I was just making fun of what the fuck was going on</p>
<p>in my life. Like I literally was just making fun of this shit. Like I had to</p>
<p>figure out a way to feel better about it. So I would just make jokes about it. Like</p>
<p>I recorded one fucking video when I was in court. And I literally just was like</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in fucking court because my crazy ass ex or whatever the fuck. Like</p>
<p>couldn&rsquo;t like fathom losing me. Like I was like making a joke of it. Because I</p>
<p>couldn&rsquo;t find any other way to deal with the situation. So I just started posting</p>
<p>random ass shit on Not Leo for legal reasons. And it was just like whatever I</p>
<p>wanted to fucking post. Problematic shit. I didn&rsquo;t care. I didn&rsquo;t give a fuck. I was</p>
<p>just posting to post. It was funny to me. So I didn&rsquo;t give a shit. But like I said</p>
<p>he was trying to drag me through court. And he was trying to sue me for all this</p>
<p>shit. And the videos did get brought up. And I didn&rsquo;t give a flying fuck. Because</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t paying for attorneys. One thing about me is I am very fucking stubborn.</p>
<p>And I was not letting this situation cost me any more fucking money. Like I</p>
<p>had already been out a lot trying to like deal with certain shit. I was like</p>
<p>fuck this. So instead of hiring an attorney. I really didn&rsquo;t have an option.</p>
<p>But I spent a lot of time studying law. And figuring out how to represent</p>
<p>myself. So I didn&rsquo;t have to get an attorney. And guess what bitch. I fucking</p>
<p>represented myself every time. And I won every single time. Put it on my fucking</p>
<p>resume. I&rsquo;m a goddamn attorney now too. No but really like it was the most</p>
<p>satisfying fucking thing. And that was such a big character building moment.</p>
<p>Like I know so much about the law. I had to learn how to like control my emotions.</p>
<p>Get it together. Speak. Even though I&rsquo;m dealing with all this shit inside. Like I</p>
<p>went and represented myself. And I fucking won. Every single time. The</p>
<p>gratification I got from that. Like oh like you spent like thousands of dollars</p>
<p>on an attorney to fight me. And I just shut them down. And I didn&rsquo;t pay nothing.</p>
<p>Ah so satisfying. But basically this ex of mine had plenty of fucking money. And</p>
<p>plenty of time. And his goal was to destroy me. And he made it very clear he</p>
<p>was never going to stop. That was his only life mission now was to fucking</p>
<p>ruin me. And he did for a while. And where I was at mentally was like not a good</p>
<p>place. And that like I said is a big component why I know so much that I know</p>
<p>now. I&rsquo;ve had to like get myself through some of the worst shit. And this was the</p>
<p>period where everywhere I turned no one could help me. No one in my life knew</p>
<p>what to tell me. No therapist. No counselor knew what to do to help me.</p>
<p>Like they didn&rsquo;t know how to help me manage my emotions. How to deal with what</p>
<p>I was feeling. They just literally looked at me and was like I don&rsquo;t know. I had</p>
<p>doctors prescribe me Xanax for anxiety and shit. Because every day I woke up it</p>
<p>was more and more shit. And also antidepressants. Which I didn&rsquo;t fucking</p>
<p>take. I was just raw dogging it bitch. Oh my god. Now that I think back I should</p>
<p>have taken them. Because that was a really really tough time. But my</p>
<p>reputation was fucking tarnished. Like anyone I was potentially gonna try and</p>
<p>date was gonna find out about that website and see all that shit. Anywhere I</p>
<p>tried to get a job I was gonna be fucked because they were gonna see that. Like my</p>
<p>reputation was ruined by this person and I didn&rsquo;t know how to get away from it.</p>
<p>And I truly like self-destructed because I didn&rsquo;t know what to do. And I didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know how to escape the reputation that he fucking destroyed of me online. I</p>
<p>genuinely didn&rsquo;t know how to fucking do it. And again I contacted attorneys and I</p>
<p>tried to figure out how to have the site taken down. I tried to have police</p>
<p>reports made. And basically they said it&rsquo;s freedom of speech. People are</p>
<p>allowed to say whatever the fuck they want about you with no slap on the hand</p>
<p>even. You&rsquo;re free to fucking say whatever you want. Like I said go buy your</p>
<p>fucking website domain of your name. Please. Trust me I&rsquo;m looking out for all</p>
<p>of you. But I did try to look into a defamation of character lawsuit. And I</p>
<p>was like I&rsquo;ll go get an attorney and sue this motherfucker for defamation of</p>
<p>character because he&rsquo;s just ripping me with a bunch of this bullshit. Like it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>all lies. So I was like I&rsquo;m gonna get your ass now. Until I went to an attorney.</p>
<p>And I went to multiple. And they all said it would be around thirty thousand</p>
<p>dollars for the case. I didn&rsquo;t have that. Didn&rsquo;t know how to get that. And no</p>
<p>attorney would represent me without payment. So that&rsquo;s not like a legal thing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like a civil thing. I don&rsquo;t know what the terms are honestly. I don&rsquo;t I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t get it. But if I didn&rsquo;t have thirty thousand dollars at least to shell out</p>
<p>for a fucking case I wasn&rsquo;t gonna be able to get anything or get him to stop.</p>
<p>Like he was just free to fuck with me because I didn&rsquo;t have money to fight him.</p>
<p>So the website was up and it wasn&rsquo;t coming down. And there was no way for me</p>
<p>to escape this reputation that he made for me. I literally was like powerless. I</p>
<p>was like there&rsquo;s no way for me to do anything. I can&rsquo;t control it. And then I</p>
<p>had a little realization one night. And I was like okay Leo what can you do?</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;re focused on all the things that are out of your control. But what</p>
<p>can you do? Because you&rsquo;ve got this reputation now. And people think this</p>
<p>certain way about you. Even though it&rsquo;s not true they don&rsquo;t know. Anyone that</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t know me and sees that they&rsquo;re just gonna assume it&rsquo;s the fucking truth.</p>
<p>So I looked at what can I do. And the idea I had was to start posting</p>
<p>consistently. Because I was growing like a little bit. I think I had like eight or</p>
<p>ten thousand followers at this point from like a little funny shit I was</p>
<p>making. But I was like I can start posting consistently and show people my</p>
<p>heart. And show people who I truly am. Because there&rsquo;s no way to change it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no way to change the reputation and the shit that was plastered online</p>
<p>about me. So my only fight against it was to just show people the real me. So</p>
<p>basically I realized you can&rsquo;t change your reputation. You can&rsquo;t change what</p>
<p>people say about you. But what you can do is be so yourself. And show people the</p>
<p>real you. So much that the claims and the shit talked about you doesn&rsquo;t make</p>
<p>fucking sense. That is your only way out of a bad reputation. You can&rsquo;t worry</p>
<p>about trying to change everything. All you can do is just be more of yourself.</p>
<p>And be more genuine. And be more fucking real. Like let people see the real you.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the only way out of it. So that&rsquo;s when I started posting consistently on</p>
<p>TikTok. And I just started posting videos that showed like my true heart. My</p>
<p>true feelings. My true thoughts. No matter if they were problematic or not.</p>
<p>Everybody knows my intentions are to help not hurt. Like I have so much love</p>
<p>to give. So I had to start giving it. And I started posting consistently. And I</p>
<p>started just showing people my personality. Showing people the real me.</p>
<p>And just being my fucking self. A lot of people say be yourself. I had a different</p>
<p>motive behind it. I had a whole like people have to see who the fuck I am.</p>
<p>There is no other option. It&rsquo;s create a name for yourself or be buried under the</p>
<p>name that someone else has made. Because like I said I didn&rsquo;t have money to fight</p>
<p>this in court. I didn&rsquo;t have money to go about like the legal route with this</p>
<p>shit. So I had to get strategic. I had to get smart. What can I do? And it started</p>
<p>working. I started blowing up for my personality. I started blowing up for my</p>
<p>little tips and tricks I shared. And like the insight I shared. And then I was just</p>
<p>entertaining in a lot of them. And people liked it. People liked how just true and</p>
<p>raw and real I was. Because I couldn&rsquo;t be anything else. I was literally forced</p>
<p>into being my authentic self. And it&rsquo;s the best thing that I ever did. But it</p>
<p>wrecked the fuck out of me. So I started gaining a little bit of a following for</p>
<p>my personality and my videos that would do well. Like on TikTok I think I had</p>
<p>like 60,000 followers or something. And I was like okay people are seeing my</p>
<p>personality and my heart a little. But like how can I make this more? So I</p>
<p>started my separate TikTok account Life Coach Leo. And that is the account where</p>
<p>I only shared advice and realizations and insight and things that I learned to</p>
<p>help other people. Because I genuinely want to fucking help people. And I was</p>
<p>going through so much shit and learning so much shit. I was like if it can help</p>
<p>anybody else, great. Let it be worth something. Because only for me to know</p>
<p>about what I was learning and like from what I was going through is a waste. I</p>
<p>want to give it to as many people as possible. Like I want to save as many</p>
<p>people as possible from their fucking suffering. So that was what that account</p>
<p>was for. And then that one started blowing up. And that one&rsquo;s at like 209,000</p>
<p>followers now. I wanted to make my following worth something. You know so I</p>
<p>just started sharing all of my advice on the one page where people got to know me</p>
<p>like deeper than my personality page. But everybody still knows the real me and my</p>
<p>personality page. It&rsquo;s not two different people. It&rsquo;s just two different topics</p>
<p>that I talk about. And then my advice videos started doing well. And people</p>
<p>liked those. And people liked me. Like a lot of people liked me for who I am and</p>
<p>the things that I share. And everybody saw how like just genuine I am. Like I</p>
<p>put my fucking heart out and people saw it. And a lot of people fucking attacked</p>
<p>me and ripped me to shit. But fuck them. Like it touched the people that I wanted</p>
<p>to touch and it worked. And when those accounts started blowing up, I finally</p>
<p>felt a sense of protection. Because this person fucked with me in every way I</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t know how to protect myself in. Like physically. Like my past before I</p>
<p>met this motherfucker, I learned how to physically protect myself. There&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>threat physically I&rsquo;m scared about. I know how to fucking deal with anything. I</p>
<p>have a high pain tolerance. I can get through anything physical. But I didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have the emotional resilience and the emotional strength. The mental strength.</p>
<p>The perspective. The awareness. Or the knowledge of how to protect myself in</p>
<p>other ways. Like either it&rsquo;s online or just work shit. Like your money flow. Like</p>
<p>I had to learn how to protect myself across the board. And gaining a</p>
<p>following kind of helps me with that. Like I felt so protected for the first</p>
<p>time. Because that was one of the big things that fucked with me was like I</p>
<p>just want to get my hands on him. Because I know how to protect myself physically.</p>
<p>Like he was ripping me and ruining me in every way I didn&rsquo;t know how to fight.</p>
<p>And the only way I knew how to fight was physical. Like come here. Let me get you.</p>
<p>And I will fucking handle this shit. You know what I mean? But not being able to</p>
<p>do that fucked with me so hard. And I felt so weak and vulnerable and fragile.</p>
<p>And like anything could hurt me. And I felt so powerless. And I hate that</p>
<p>fucking feeling. Everybody does. But going through all of this gave me like my sense</p>
<p>of power back. And taught me how to truly be fucking resilient and protect</p>
<p>myself in all aspects. Not just physically. So I thought I was tough</p>
<p>before. Now? Impenetrable bitch. You can&rsquo;t fuck with me. But like I said I got a</p>
<p>feeling of a sense of protection when I started blowing up. Because I was like</p>
<p>people see the real me now. You know? Like they see it. They get it. Like I felt a</p>
<p>little bit more like relief. And I felt a little tiny sliver of fucking hope. The</p>
<p>smallest little sliver. Smaller than a bump. But hiding took my power away. And</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s exactly what I wanted to do when all of this was happening. Was just hide.</p>
<p>Because who the fuck wants to be seen or be known with a reputation like that?</p>
<p>Like I just wanted to disappear. But the exact opposite is what saved me. Like I</p>
<p>had this terrible reputation I just wanted to hide from and not be seen and</p>
<p>just disappear. But the cure was to hide in plain fucking sight. And show everyone</p>
<p>the true me. So that it made every claim made about me invalid. Y&rsquo;all aren&rsquo;t gonna</p>
<p>believe shit if someone just gets online and starts running their mouth now. Like</p>
<p>now I feel confident because I have shown you the real me. It takes a lot of</p>
<p>courage to do that. But it&rsquo;s a lot of safety in that too. Like I feel very</p>
<p>protected now. Because you guys know the real me. And not even that you know the</p>
<p>real me. You care about the real me. And for that I cannot thank you enough. And</p>
<p>then the whole process of this shit show is when I was starting my app Positive</p>
<p>Focus. And this motherfucker went on there and left one star reviews on it to</p>
<p>try and bring me down. Like literally any move I made was countered. Like when I</p>
<p>had no like reviews on it it was just one star shit. And he left multiple and I</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t get them taken off. So if you&rsquo;re watching this and you have an iPhone or</p>
<p>an Android. Will you go download my app please. And just leave it a 5 star rating</p>
<p>to counter some of that shit. Like I hate to sound like a fucking pick me and ask.</p>
<p>But like there&rsquo;s no other way to counter it. I can&rsquo;t get them removed. I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>contacted Apple. I&rsquo;ve contacted anyone you can contact. There&rsquo;s no way to get</p>
<p>them out. So I just need as many up votes as I can get to counteract the bad votes.</p>
<p>So they would mean the world to me. Thank you. But also with starting my app. My app</p>
<p>was like one thing that gave me a little sliver of hope again. But when I was in</p>
<p>the process of making it and then I made it. The motherfucker messaged me. Like</p>
<p>emailed me. And I had to change my email 25 times. I had to change my fucking phone</p>
<p>number five times. Because like I said the harassment was that. And he kept</p>
<p>getting my fucking new information off of legal documents. Like when I</p>
<p>copyrighted my app and I trademarked everything. That motherfucker like found</p>
<p>the public information. And then started harassing me again. So I had to change</p>
<p>all my shit again. And there&rsquo;s no way to like completely get everything about you</p>
<p>taken offline. So it&rsquo;s just a goddamn shit show. I&rsquo;m fine now. But I have so</p>
<p>many emails. And I have so many different like phone numbers. You&rsquo;d shit yourself.</p>
<p>But I got an email when I launched my app. That a new app was being created.</p>
<p>Just like mine. That was going to take all of the content that mine shares. But</p>
<p>is going to be paid to be advertised above mine. So that mine looks like the</p>
<p>copy. And that mine looks like the fake. I tried to start the app. And he was</p>
<p>gonna counter it. And he had a team build another app. Just like my app. To steal</p>
<p>the content from it. And because he had more money. He could pay to advertise it</p>
<p>more than mine. And make mine shrivel away and be nothing. So when I told y&rsquo;all</p>
<p>I was hopeless. And I saw no way out. I fucking meant it. Every move I made was</p>
<p>countered. But with posting everything online. It truly helped me a lot with</p>
<p>everything. And then I started my podcast. Which is a whole separate story about</p>
<p>how this came about. Because it was one of them little suicidal things. And I was</p>
<p>like I need to make a podcast. But this podcast helped you guys get to know me</p>
<p>even more. Like there is no doubt that you guys see my heart and my true</p>
<p>intentions. Like I have no anything. Like I have no hesitation. No worry. No fear</p>
<p>about anyone saying shit. Because like you guys get it. You guys know me. Like</p>
<p>you fucking can&rsquo;t not. You know what I mean? Like this brought me so much security with</p>
<p>my audience. And all of you that follow me and listen to me. Like I feel like I</p>
<p>can trust you. And I trust you guys&rsquo;s judgment. Because you&rsquo;re not just gonna</p>
<p>believe something that you fucking hear. Because you&rsquo;ve heard everything from me</p>
<p>personally. Like if someone makes this claim. Oh Leo&rsquo;s racist. You fucking know</p>
<p>me better than that. I&rsquo;m too goddamn aware to be fucking racist. Are you kidding me?</p>
<p>You would never think that I let skin color dictate what I think about human</p>
<p>beings. Are you fucking kidding me? Y&rsquo;all know me better than that. See? Like I have</p>
<p>so much confidence with y&rsquo;all. Because like y&rsquo;all fucking know better. But</p>
<p>luckily the websites that were created are down now. All that shit&rsquo;s gone. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>in the fucking past. I had it handled. And handled some of it myself. But all that</p>
<p>shit&rsquo;s over with. That I know of. And I don&rsquo;t give a fuck if things start up</p>
<p>again. Because of what I&rsquo;ve created for myself. I&rsquo;ve created connections and</p>
<p>relationships with all of you. That can&rsquo;t be fucked with. Like I said anyone can</p>
<p>say anything and you&rsquo;re not gonna fucking believe it. Because you know the</p>
<p>real me. If they say something accurate you&rsquo;d be like okay that was accurate. But like you</p>
<p>know the real fucking truth. But that&rsquo;s the main reason that I blew up online. Is</p>
<p>because I was just straight the fuck up. Honest. Real. Authentic. And I just I have</p>
<p>nothing to fucking hide. And I&rsquo;m genuine as shit with my presence online. And</p>
<p>anything I post and share. And that&rsquo;s why I still continue to grow. So anyone</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s considering getting online. If you got a situation similar to mine. Or you</p>
<p>just want to be online. And you want to know how to grow. I hate to be cliche. But</p>
<p>be your fucking self. And not just be yourself. Have something to fucking share</p>
<p>and contribute. Whether it&rsquo;s gonna be valuable information. Insight. Comedy.</p>
<p>Entertainment. Whatever it is. Just share your heart. Share everything that&rsquo;s true</p>
<p>inside of you. And people will like it. And the last thing I want to say about</p>
<p>this episode. I&rsquo;m gonna have to get heartfelt for a second. Is the only sense</p>
<p>of safety I&rsquo;ve ever felt is alone. And by myself. And this entire experience has</p>
<p>brought me close to so many of you. And has taught me that my true sense of</p>
<p>safety is with other people. Not myself. So I just want to say like the biggest</p>
<p>thank you. From the bottom of my fucking heart. Because you have no clue what I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>been through. You know snippets of it. You know little shit. But if you could cut me</p>
<p>open and see the things that I&rsquo;ve felt and been through. You wouldn&rsquo;t believe it.</p>
<p>But thank you all for caring about me. For real. Like I appreciate every single</p>
<p>one of you individually. And I&rsquo;ll never fucking let you down. Ever. Like what I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>built is the most genuine shit I could have ever built. And I&rsquo;m proud of it. And</p>
<p>you guys have no clue how much of a big and like important role you play in my</p>
<p>life. And also the way that I feel. And that&rsquo;s the best gift I could ever get. So</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had the money. I&rsquo;ve got the fame. I&rsquo;ve got all this fucking shit. And the</p>
<p>way that y&rsquo;all make me feel is the only thing I give a fuck about. And that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what truly matters in this life. So if you could tell me Leo I&rsquo;ll give you a</p>
<p>billion dollars. Or I can give you your followers. I&rsquo;ll take the followers. I&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>take the people who care about me. And I mean that with my whole heart. So again I</p>
<p>just want to say a big thank you for caring about me. And for sticking with me.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m gonna leave it off there. Everything you need from me is in the</p>
<p>description below. If you want to follow me on everything. If you want to download</p>
<p>my app and leave me a good review please. Links in the description. But everybody</p>
<p>be safe and take care of yourself. And I will talk to you guys next Sunday. On a</p>
<p>more positive note I feel.</p>
