    <p>Before Darlene&rsquo;s body had even been found, a tip had come in to police.</p>
<p>A man named Jim Garman suggested they check out the home of a woman named Thelma Burns.</p>
<p>He said there were a lot of quote-unquote druggies and creeps who stayed there.</p>
<p>When police went by to talk to him the next evening, this now being after Darlene&rsquo;s body</p>
<p>had been found, Jim Garman&rsquo;s tip had gotten even more specific, and it pointed the finger</p>
<p>at one particular man, Danny Bender.</p>
<p>This is Episode 4, They Left Town.</p>
<p>James gave police a quick version of events over the phone when they spoke to him a couple</p>
<p>of times on the 18th.</p>
<p>But a few days later, they asked him to come in to give a formal statement.</p>
<p>James said the weekend before the murder, he&rsquo;d run into an acquaintance, Thelma, at</p>
<p>the laundromat, and arranged to buy some speed off her.</p>
<p>And Danny Bender was with her.</p>
<p>They all made plans to meet later at James and his wife&rsquo;s house to party that night,</p>
<p>after they got done with their laundry.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an actor reading James Garman&rsquo;s exact statement.</p>
<p>On the Sunday before the thing happened at the residence on 20 B Road, I was at my house</p>
<p>and Thelma Burns and a guy by the name of Dan, I think his last name is Bender, came</p>
<p>over and Dan and I got into my car to go to Thelma&rsquo;s to get a keg of beer.</p>
<p>On the way over to Thelma&rsquo;s, he started talking about stealing and he said he was a kleptomaniac</p>
<p>and I was thinking about my tools and my backhoe.</p>
<p>And I told him that just because a guy has belongings, that it doesn&rsquo;t mean he has money.</p>
<p>When we crossed the tracks on State Road 110, we were coming up to the first road past the</p>
<p>tracks and he pointed out to the north and he said that there is a young guy who works</p>
<p>at Yungdor and who just bought a new house and paid cash for it.</p>
<p>And he said that they had a lot of cash in the house, like they didn&rsquo;t trust banks.</p>
<p>Then he started talking about going to California with this guy who was staying at Thelma&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>We went on and got the beer and on the way back, he told me that he just got out of prison</p>
<p>for armed robbery.</p>
<p>He also said that he had an uncle that owns a junkyard on 25 South of 110.</p>
<p>So not only was James super forthcoming with police, but his story seemed legit.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;d stayed pretty consistent from the interviews over the phone to the one that he did in person.</p>
<p>So police wasted no time looking into Danny Bender and it turns out he did have a criminal</p>
<p>record and had in fact been in prison, out in Texas, but not for armed robbery, for kidnapping.</p>
<p>And he had just gotten released on July 1st.</p>
<p>But there was one problem.</p>
<p>Danny was nowhere to be found.</p>
<p>Police were hearing that he might have skipped town recently, like right around the time</p>
<p>of the murder kind of recently, which made him look even more suspicious.</p>
<p>Soon enough, people in Danny&rsquo;s social circle started talking and word got to Danny that</p>
<p>the cops had been looking for him.</p>
<p>So Danny just called them up, all the way from Colorado.</p>
<p>Danny told Sergeant Yokelet that he had been out West since even before the murder happened.</p>
<p>He said he even had a friend who could vouch for him because they had hitchhiked out there</p>
<p>together, from Indiana to Illinois, all the way to Utah and Nevada before going back to Colorado.</p>
<p>Danny also said that he wasn&rsquo;t familiar with Darlene or Ron Hulse, but he did admit to</p>
<p>maybe having heard the last name Hulse before.</p>
<p>Police, gauging that Danny was a talker and seemed pretty willing to cooperate, were like,</p>
<p>listen, your statement over the phone is really no good to us.</p>
<p>We need you to get back to Indiana to take a polygraph.</p>
<p>And Danny was like, sure, but you got to come and get me.</p>
<p>So two investigators hopped on a flight and escorted Danny back to Indiana, where they</p>
<p>wasted no time in getting him hooked up to a lie detector test.</p>
<p>Subject advised that he was not in Indiana on August 17th, that he does not know Darlene</p>
<p>Hulse by name, but he might by sight, and that he did not know Ron Hulse by name, but</p>
<p>he might know him by sight.</p>
<p>He advised that he did not know the house or where it was at.</p>
<p>He advised that the officers told him that Ron Hulse worked for Youngdore.</p>
<p>He advised that the only person he knows at Youngdore would be his uncle.</p>
<p>Subject advised that the reason he left Indiana was for a job, and that he wanted to go out</p>
<p>west with Tim.</p>
<p>He advised that he did try to make a couple phone calls while he was out west.</p>
<p>Subject advised that he was told that the woman was beat to death, but he does not know</p>
<p>how.</p>
<p>Subject advised that he has not broken into anywhere since he&rsquo;s been out of prison, and</p>
<p>that he left to go out west on August 15th.</p>
<p>During the pretest portion of the examination, the subject gave the following information,</p>
<p>that he does not know who killed the woman.</p>
<p>He is not trying to withhold any information from anyone about the murder.</p>
<p>He denied having the conversation with Garman that Garman describes.</p>
<p>He denied pointing out the home of the victim as a good place to burglarize.</p>
<p>He denied telling Garman or anyone else that the owner of the house worked at Youngdore.</p>
<p>He stated that the conversation he did have with Garman was about a house that was located</p>
<p>at the corner of State Road 110 and Old 31.</p>
<p>He stated that this house was owned by a probation or parole officer.</p>
<p>This was the house that he described to Garman as a good place to rip off.</p>
<p>Subject was given two tests.</p>
<p>His polygrams contained specific reactions indicative of deception to the relevant questions</p>
<p>pertaining to.</p>
<p>Do you plan to try to lie to me on this test?</p>
<p>Answer no.</p>
<p>Do you know who beat Darlene Hulse?</p>
<p>Answer no.</p>
<p>Did you know in advance who was going to the Hulse house?</p>
<p>Answer no.</p>
<p>Did you talk about the Hulse house before the murder?</p>
<p>Answer no.</p>
<p>Are you attempting to protect anyone now?</p>
<p>Answer no.</p>
<p>Are you attempting to withhold information from me about this matter?</p>
<p>Answer no.</p>
<p>Have you lied to any of my questions?</p>
<p>Answer no.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>After careful analysis of this subject&rsquo;s polygrams, it is the opinion of the examiner that he</p>
<p>did not tell the complete truth.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Ed Criswell wanted Danny&rsquo;s full story, so they went around the area trying</p>
<p>to talk to some of the people known to hang around him, including his relatives at the</p>
<p>junkyard in Fulton County.</p>
<p>They already knew Danny didn&rsquo;t own a car, but since he had ties to a junkyard, they</p>
<p>wanted to find out if he&rsquo;d had access to a rusty old green four-door car.</p>
<p>But as you can imagine, looking for something like that at a junkyard was a needle in a</p>
<p>haystack situation, and it didn&rsquo;t result in anything meaningful.</p>
<p>So police arranged to interview Danny again and asked him to start with what he&rsquo;d been</p>
<p>up to since he was released from prison in Texas, all the way until he allegedly left</p>
<p>Indiana on August 15th.</p>
<p>Danny said that he had gotten out of prison on July 1st, and a friend had picked him up</p>
<p>and got him a plane ticket back to Indiana.</p>
<p>He said he landed in Indianapolis on July 2nd and hitchhiked up to Plymouth.</p>
<p>He then went through what he did each day, which was basically him partying day and night</p>
<p>with various people around Plymouth, Argus, and another small town called Monterey.</p>
<p>And he was working odd jobs for a few weeks all in between there.</p>
<p>Investigators grilled him for hours, but according to the report, he didn&rsquo;t give up much.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a reenactment of that questioning between Dave Yochelet and Danny Bender.</p>
<p>Basically, Danny didn&rsquo;t want to snitch.</p>
<p>He actually told police he would rather spend 30 years in prison than nark on someone.</p>
<p>Police were ready to keep interrogating Danny daily until they could get more out of him.</p>
<p>But there was one hang-up.</p>
<p>Marie and Melissa didn&rsquo;t recognize him.</p>
<p>And you might think, well, that&rsquo;s the end of Danny as a suspect, but police weren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>ready to give up on him that easily.</p>
<p>They knew that the girls had been traumatized, and they wanted to check him off their list</p>
<p>so to speak, with other evidence.</p>
<p>So police kept Danny in jail on an unrelated warrant.</p>
<p>While there, Danny wrote a letter to his dear friend Thelma.</p>
<p>Thelma, hi.</p>
<p>So how&rsquo;s life been your way?</p>
<p>If you see Jim, tell him I said I understand why he called the law.</p>
<p>But Thelma, I got to tell you one thing.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know who killed that chick.</p>
<p>I told my mom in the letter that I wrote her and didn&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>But I wish in a way I did, because they showed me some picture of her after they found her</p>
<p>body and it fucked me up.</p>
<p>By the way, the law told me what you said.</p>
<p>I thought Ace was funny.</p>
<p>Thelma, if this letter sounds like I&rsquo;m nuts, it&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;m in a one-man cell and they</p>
<p>won&rsquo;t let me call no one.</p>
<p>And I keep telling them I don&rsquo;t remember who told me about the house.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, they told me I could get 20 years for not tell, and 30 years for the bitch,</p>
<p>and two years for leaving the state.</p>
<p>But if I tell them, they&rsquo;ll drop all the charges and let me go.</p>
<p>Thelma, I think you know me better than one else does, because you know the real me on</p>
<p>both side of me.</p>
<p>You do believe me.</p>
<p>If I know who killed that chick, I&rsquo;d tell them.</p>
<p>Love, your friend, Danny.&quot;</p>
<p>Before police could really rule Danny in or out, tips started to pile up and investigators</p>
<p>knew they needed to split resources to avoid getting tunnel vision for Danny.</p>
<p>And just as they figured, as soon as they started vetting other leads, another viable</p>
<p>suspect made his way onto their radar.</p>
<p>Robert Zabrowski.</p>
<p>People had been calling in, saying that Robert not only fit the description of the man who</p>
<p>killed Darlene, but just like Danny, he was said to have left town right after the murder.</p>
<p>According to what they were hearing, Robert was now with a traveling carnival in Alabama.</p>
<p>Sure enough, that is exactly where they found him.</p>
<p>Investigators got the cooperation of a police department down there to bring him in and</p>
<p>administer a polygraph while Indiana officials came and got him.</p>
<p>Robert said he didn&rsquo;t know anything about the murder, but he failed the polygraph.</p>
<p>So by the time Indiana authorities made it to him, they were more eager than ever to</p>
<p>bring him back to Indiana and talk to him there.</p>
<p>And Robert went willingly.</p>
<p>Even though he wasn&rsquo;t under arrest, he said he was willing to help them out, though he</p>
<p>never wavered in saying that he had nothing to do with any murder.</p>
<p>The entire way up there, he wasn&rsquo;t acting like a guilty man.</p>
<p>Or if he was a guilty man, maybe he was a man without a conscience, because he slept</p>
<p>practically the whole drive.</p>
<p>One of the first things they did when they got back was to give Robert another polygraph,</p>
<p>one of their own.</p>
<p>Roberts stated he knew why he was there, reference he was a suspect in a murder case.</p>
<p>He advised he was at a friend&rsquo;s house having coffee when he heard about the kidnapping.</p>
<p>He advised that that night he had heard a bulletin on the television set in which they</p>
<p>had advised that the woman had been beaten and that the description fit him.</p>
<p>He advised the description fit him, but that the description was described as having a</p>
<p>goatee, that he did not have one, and he advised that that was the only thing that he had prior</p>
<p>to talking to police.</p>
<p>Once talking to police, he advised that he now knows that the woman was beat in the face</p>
<p>or head, but he does not know what she was beat with, that her husband and daughters</p>
<p>are eyewitnesses to the kidnapping and beating.</p>
<p>Subject advised that the day in question he was at Betty Zaner&rsquo;s house, that he got up,</p>
<p>had breakfast.</p>
<p>He then went to Rochester, to the Fulton Industries, and put an application in.</p>
<p>He then went to Winnemac and drove around, but did not stop and put an application in</p>
<p>anywhere.</p>
<p>Subject advised he then stopped and got gas.</p>
<p>He then took SR-14 and SR-17.</p>
<p>He stopped by a friend&rsquo;s house at Tippecanoe Shores and then went to Culver and got cigarettes,</p>
<p>and that he then went to a Roy Carr&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>Subject advised that referenced the car that was supposed to have been used in the murder,</p>
<p>that he does not remember what kind of car it was, but that he does remember that it</p>
<p>did not match the kind of car that he does have.</p>
<p>Subject advised that he&rsquo;s never killed anyone.</p>
<p>Subject was given three tests.</p>
<p>His polygrams contained specific reactions indicative of deception to the relevant questions</p>
<p>pertaining to,</p>
<p>Do you plan to try to lie to me on this test?</p>
<p>Answer no.</p>
<p>Have you told me the whole truth since we&rsquo;ve been talking?</p>
<p>Answer yes.</p>
<p>Do you know who killed the woman on August 17th?</p>
<p>Answer no.</p>
<p>Did you go to the woman&rsquo;s house on August 17th?</p>
<p>Answer no.</p>
<p>Did you have a poker in your hand on August 17th?</p>
<p>Answer no.</p>
<p>Did you beat a woman on August 17th?</p>
<p>Answer no.</p>
<p>Are you attempting to withhold information from me about this matter?</p>
<p>Answer no.</p>
<p>Have you lied to any of my questions?</p>
<p>Answer no.</p>
<p>Did you go to Darlene Hulse&rsquo;s house on August 17th?</p>
<p>Answer no.</p>
<p>Did you struggle with the woman on August 17th?</p>
<p>Answer no.</p>
<p>Did you drive someone else&rsquo;s car on August 17th?</p>
<p>Answer no.</p>
<p>Did you dump the woman&rsquo;s body in the woods on August 17th?</p>
<p>Answer no.</p>
<p>After careful analysis of this subject&rsquo;s polygrams, it is the opinion of the examiner</p>
<p>that he did not tell the complete truth.</p>
<p>By the way, the bulletin did not describe the suspect as having a goatee, so I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>sure where he got that info.</p>
<p>The robber went on to say that yes, technically he was in Argus on the 17th, but he&rsquo;d only</p>
<p>gotten there in the afternoon, after the murder.</p>
<p>And when he was there, he was busy filling out a job application.</p>
<p>Police did end up tracking down the application, filled out by hand in Robert&rsquo;s handwriting.</p>
<p>But of course, the application wasn&rsquo;t time-stamped or anything, so it wasn&rsquo;t the strongest alibi</p>
<p>of all time.</p>
<p>Aside from him being in Argus when the crime happened, and then leaving a month or so later,</p>
<p>there wasn&rsquo;t much else about Robert that stood out.</p>
<p>They weren&rsquo;t finding nearly as much dirt on him as they had on Danny Bender.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t have a green car, he didn&rsquo;t have a ton of local ties, and he wasn&rsquo;t offering</p>
<p>up a confession.</p>
<p>After three iffy polygraph tests, they didn&rsquo;t have enough to hold Robert, and they had to</p>
<p>let him go.</p>
<p>But before they did, they did take his fingerprints, just in case.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, while police had been vetting these suspects, the Hulse family was grappling with</p>
<p>life without Darlene.</p>
<p>Which was hard.</p>
<p>By this time, Darlene&rsquo;s toxicology had come back, and it was clear she had no drugs or</p>
<p>alcohol in her system when she died.</p>
<p>Ron wasn&rsquo;t surprised by this, because they lived a party-free existence.</p>
<p>Their lives revolved around each other, their kids, and church.</p>
<p>It was a humble life, which was another reason why robbery as a motive was so confusing for</p>
<p>their family.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s Marie again.</p>
<p>I remember dad being worried about how to pay for her funeral expenses.</p>
<p>Just little things like that.</p>
<p>And he would get letters in the mail, and people would send him like $10, $15, and like</p>
<p>he would just cry every time he opened the mail.</p>
<p>I remember him being at my grandparents&rsquo; house crying as they opened the mail.</p>
<p>The Hulse family was just praying that police would catch the right guy while trying to</p>
<p>survive each day without Darlene.</p>
<p>And eventually, they moved back into their house, which was hard.</p>
<p>There were big and little reminders of their mom everywhere, and not just reminders of</p>
<p>her as their mother, but awful reminders of what had happened to her.</p>
<p>We helped him clean up the house.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t have like a surf pro back then.</p>
<p>Every once in a while, they&rsquo;d find like, they&rsquo;d see a rock or something with blood.</p>
<p>And it looks different than what you think it&rsquo;s going to look like.</p>
<p>My eight-year-old self, I thought it was supposed to be bright red.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s dark.</p>
<p>And you know, my dad, because he built the entire house, he poured all of the concrete.</p>
<p>He did the split rail fence.</p>
<p>He did everything.</p>
<p>And so, I don&rsquo;t even know why we were the ones that had to go clean it up.</p>
<p>You know, when he drug her, her blood was all over, and we had a gravel driveway, so</p>
<p>it got on the rocks.</p>
<p>And for years, you could see, I would see a dark, a dark rock with dark, it&rsquo;s almost</p>
<p>like blackish brown by the time you see it.</p>
<p>And I was like, I just, and I don&rsquo;t think he had an option.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think anyone was like, let me go clean that up for you.</p>
<p>The daily reminders were one thing, but certain things made it really hard for the whole family</p>
<p>as they tried to regain a sense of normalcy.</p>
<p>You realize that what happened at your house, no one wants to come to your house and spend</p>
<p>the night.</p>
<p>You go to other people&rsquo;s homes.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t invite people over, because you&rsquo;re, I mean, that&rsquo;s the house that it happened</p>
<p>at.</p>
<p>It was such a small town.</p>
<p>Investigators were becoming more concerned with each passing day.</p>
<p>Every time they had a suspect in for questioning that didn&rsquo;t result in getting answers, they</p>
<p>had to go tell the grieving Hulse family that they were still working every lead possible.</p>
<p>But they knew, deep down, that they might have just wasted several months on two suspects</p>
<p>that resulted in absolutely nothing.</p>
<p>On October 26th, 1984, just as they thought things were slowing down, police got their</p>
<p>strongest lead yet when Indiana State Police called Marshall County Sergeant Dave Yokelet.</p>
<p>He informed me of an individual who had been shot and killed by police in Amarillo, Texas</p>
<p>the day prior, which would be the 25th of October, 1984.</p>
<p>He advised this individual was Ricky Mock.</p>
<p>Police were searching an apartment in Logansport, Indiana, where this individual is from, and</p>
<p>had located a newspaper clipping in regards to the homicide investigation, and also some</p>
<p>clothes that had what appeared to be blood on them.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s coming up in Episode 5, He&rsquo;s Gunned Down.</p>
<p>You can listen to that right now.</p>
