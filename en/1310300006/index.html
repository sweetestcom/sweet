<p>Hello, Michelle, how are you doing today?</p>
<p>Hi, Lindsay. I&rsquo;m good. Happy 2023.</p>
<p>I know. It&rsquo;s just amazing. Oh my God. Are you excited about this new year?</p>
<p>I am. I&rsquo;m ready. I&rsquo;m ready for it. I&rsquo;m ready for a new year.</p>
<p>Yeah, we&rsquo;ve had an intense couple of years, 2020, 2021, 2022,</p>
<p>very intense years. Now we&rsquo;re ready to have hopefully a lighter year.</p>
<p>Knock on wood, knock on wood. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p>Do you typically do you enjoy this time of year when you have a chance to kind of</p>
<p>set new goals and just, you know, really get yourself on the right track?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a clean slate. I do like it. I also, I have to be honest.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a little intimidating for me. Like I&rsquo;m not,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not like a huge one on like the big resolutions because I mean,</p>
<p>I do think it puts a lot of pressure and also like you can set a resolution at</p>
<p>any time of the year. However, however, like I,</p>
<p>I do think it&rsquo;s good to kind of feel that freshness and to kind of get in the</p>
<p>right mindset of the new year. But I also don&rsquo;t like to be like, well,</p>
<p>these are like, this is what has to happen this year. All the time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like a little too much, like, especially for a professionally,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s one thing, but for personal life,</p>
<p>I think it can be a little bit intimidating and, you know, but,</p>
<p>but good to think about. What do you think?</p>
<p>Yeah. I mean, I think anytime we have a chance to change our habits,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s exciting.</p>
<p>Like I just came back from my trip to Argentina that I shared with our</p>
<p>listeners that we were going, it was amazing. And I came back and now I&rsquo;m like,</p>
<p>wow, I could change the way I do things. Right. I could change my workflow.</p>
<p>I could make changes and to be more efficient, especially at work or even in life.</p>
<p>Right. It&rsquo;s a, it&rsquo;s an opportunity. So it&rsquo;s not pressure in my mind.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more like, if I want to make this change, I could,</p>
<p>usually I kind of just fall back into my old habits, to be honest.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s very common. But no, I, I, I agree with you.</p>
<p>I do think it&rsquo;s nice. And I do like to like set new goals and things like that.</p>
<p>Again,</p>
<p>I think personal versus professional is a little bit of a different feel for me.</p>
<p>The personal is a little like, yeah, I can,</p>
<p>I can do it anytime. And I want to have that feeling.</p>
<p>Like I can make changes anytime as work as well.</p>
<p>But I think sometimes the personal, like the typical, you know, resolutions,</p>
<p>like stop doing this, like stop this habit, stop this habit.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s nice to think about, but sometimes I feel like, you know, it&rsquo;s, it can,</p>
<p>it can be a little much sometimes.</p>
<p>Yeah, for sure. So for our listeners, guys, listen up.</p>
<p>If you are the kind of person that needs to build momentum,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re going to make a change,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re going to ramp up your English this year, we have an opportunity</p>
<p>to join our challenge, our five-day challenge.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re calling it the new me in 2023 five-day challenge.</p>
<p>You like that title, Michelle?</p>
<p>I love it. And you know, I just realized that I was saying,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t put too much pressure on yourself. However, like I said, however,</p>
<p>to be honest, when it comes to learning something new,</p>
<p>I especially think that this is like a new time.</p>
<p>I guess what I was talking about more of the hat, more of the things like stop</p>
<p>biting my nails, you know, how people say like lose weight,</p>
<p>like those kinds of things I feel like are just kind of like the things that</p>
<p>people say every year. However, when it comes to a new skill to finding yourself,</p>
<p>I think that has a different feeling because it&rsquo;s more,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s less about stopping something and more about starting.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I was just going to say.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I was just noticing in the examples you use, right?</p>
<p>Stop smoking. I don&rsquo;t smoke and you don&rsquo;t smoke, but some people do, right?</p>
<p>Stop smoking, stop biting nails, stop eating too much.</p>
<p>These are all kind of self-discipline restrictive things, right? Exactly.</p>
<p>But what I love is the idea of the endowed progress effect.</p>
<p>So if I see that I&rsquo;ve made progress towards my goal every day,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s incredibly motivating for the human mind.</p>
<p>Yes. So I think that like having that start mindset,</p>
<p>yeah, that&rsquo;s where,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s where you&rsquo;re going to get motivated and inspired rather than the stop</p>
<p>stop doing this. I&rsquo;ve done this wrong. I&rsquo;m beating myself up about this.</p>
<p>Right. Two different kinds of goals. Exactly. Exactly. So guys,</p>
<p>this offer is going on right now, but just right now, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not going to be available forever. It doesn&rsquo;t make sense forever.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s available until January 7th. Michelle,</p>
<p>what is the link where they can go to get this before we get into the quotes for</p>
<p>today?</p>
<p>Okay. So the link is allearsenglish.com slash new</p>
<p>\2023. So 2 0 2 3. Yeah. So go there. And I&rsquo;ll explain a little,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll explain Michelle and I will explain a little bit more what exactly it is</p>
<p>later in the episode.</p>
<p>But I want to start off today with some exciting and fulfilling quotes just to</p>
<p>talk about them and see what they mean to us at this time of year. Michelle,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the first quote?</p>
<p>Well, I love this one. The secret of getting ahead is getting started.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s by Mark Twain.</p>
<p>Yeah. And this is exactly what we&rsquo;re saying, right?</p>
<p>This is exactly what we&rsquo;re saying. This is not about stopping doing something.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about what do you do with your first week of 2023 and how can you get ahead</p>
<p>more in your mind? It&rsquo;s a mind game, Michelle.</p>
<p>Right. You want to propel yourself forward. So the feeling of this is, you know,</p>
<p>just if you don&rsquo;t get started, you can&rsquo;t get ahead.</p>
<p>Sometimes I think we get like, or I mean for myself,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure for a lot of people, you know, you kind of get like,</p>
<p>you can kind of get frozen. Yeah. Frozen. Yes.</p>
<p>And just to have this new year,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s this opportunity to be like, no, I&rsquo;m like, whatever it was,</p>
<p>whatever it was, it&rsquo;s time to get started,</p>
<p>time to get excited instead of being frozen in place.</p>
<p>Yeah. I think part of the problem is when we know we want to do something,</p>
<p>we think we have to do it all that same day. So for example, you know,</p>
<p>if I know that I want to kick back up my Spanish,</p>
<p>because I was actually excited about how I felt so comfortable in</p>
<p>Argentine Spanish, Michelle, oh, it is so hard to understand.</p>
<p>They speak so fast. They use a totally different accent.</p>
<p>But my listening was actually the strongest I&rsquo;ve seen in all of our trips to</p>
<p>Spanish speaking countries. Yeah. I was ready for it.</p>
<p>I had hired four or five different tutors on italki to practice this Argentine</p>
<p>Spanish leading into it. But now we&rsquo;ve been back for a few weeks.</p>
<p>Have I taken lessons? Have I was going to continue my lessons? No,</p>
<p>I have not gone back to them. So what I&rsquo;m trying to say here is,</p>
<p>the secret is just getting started.</p>
<p>I could build that progress effect in my mind by just booking my next lesson.</p>
<p>And that would be all I would have to do today.</p>
<p>And then tomorrow I just show up for the lesson and then I book it again.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s one little step at a time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not doing the whole lesson that first day. Right, Michelle?</p>
<p>Oh yeah. And I think, you know,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s where it&rsquo;s easy to get into trouble is to have that mindset of like,</p>
<p>you got to do it all. Like, I want to learn a new language. Let&rsquo;s do it.</p>
<p>All right. The second, like, that&rsquo;s, you know, it&rsquo;s not,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not really reasonable and you&rsquo;re going to get burnt out. Um,</p>
<p>right. So we want to have this, you know, okay, we&rsquo;re getting the momentum.</p>
<p>I love what you said is just like, just setting the next appointment,</p>
<p>doing that one intentional thing that will give you the next step.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s huge.</p>
<p>Exactly. Or have you ever had the experience where you&rsquo;re going to,</p>
<p>you have a blank canvas in front of you.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say you have to write a paper. You know,</p>
<p>what I do is I&rsquo;ll go and make an outline and just doing that.</p>
<p>Or I have to do a project which involves a spreadsheet. It&rsquo;s complicated.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll go and set up the, the columns and the rows.</p>
<p>And then I feel so much, I just feel good.</p>
<p>I feel like I&rsquo;m building the bones of the project. Right, right, right.</p>
<p>Or even just like making an appointment that you have to make. I mean,</p>
<p>even, I mean, like sometimes I can be like a little paranoid about my health</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll be like, Oh, I have, you know, I have, I have this, I have that.</p>
<p>And my mom&rsquo;s like, well then just call the doctor.</p>
<p>Like even just sometimes like making the appointment makes you feel better.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s just another kind of way to think about it. Another example.</p>
<p>I love it. So good. So guys,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s our first quote that we hope inspires you at the beginning of the year</p>
<p>is the secret of getting ahead is just getting started.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually easier than we, than we realize, Michelle. I love that.</p>
<p>Now do we have a second quote for our listeners today?</p>
<p>Yes. And this is by, uh, Theodore Roosevelt.</p>
<p>So he was the president of the U S, uh, from 1901 to 1909. Right, Lindsay?</p>
<p>Yeah. Uh-huh. And he established a lot of our national parks.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s amazing. The older I get,</p>
<p>the more I appreciate the national parks,</p>
<p>having gone to a lot of them and thinking it&rsquo;s really special to be able to enter</p>
<p>a park and pay some money.</p>
<p>And you know that this land is preserved and you can hike and you can explore.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s incredible, Michelle. I need to do more of the national parks.</p>
<p>You really should, you really should.</p>
<p>And there are a lot on the East coast too, right?</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to drive across the whole country. So what&rsquo;s the quote?</p>
<p>The quote is keep your eyes on the stars and your feet on the ground.</p>
<p>Yes. So what does this strike you at? Like what, what,</p>
<p>what do you think of when you hear this quote?</p>
<p>Um, well, I, I, I, this feeling of, you know,</p>
<p>remaining stable that my headphone is falling out of my ear.</p>
<p>Remaining stable, remaining grounded, but having a lot of ambition, right?</p>
<p>So like you have big dreams, you have big dreams,</p>
<p>but in order to do them,</p>
<p>you have to actually do them rather than like thinking about them.</p>
<p>Do you know what I mean?</p>
<p>Yeah. It makes me think of the expression.</p>
<p>This is a bonus for our listeners down to earth, right?</p>
<p>In your mind, is that a good thing or not a good thing to be down to earth?</p>
<p>I, to me, it&rsquo;s a very good thing. What do you think?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a good thing. Yeah, for sure. But you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>In order to kind of build a successful life, we need both.</p>
<p>We need to be grounded, as you said,</p>
<p>and we need to kind of be reaching for the stars.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s somewhere in between that we&rsquo;re going to hang out. Right, right, right,</p>
<p>right, right, right. Because if you&rsquo;re not, if you don&rsquo;t have those,</p>
<p>like your eyes like set on this big goal,</p>
<p>then you might not be motivated to do the actual work. Yeah. Vice versa.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re, uh, if you&rsquo;re wait, now I&rsquo;m getting,</p>
<p>now I&rsquo;m getting myself confused. Well, yeah,</p>
<p>or, or if you like, uh, don&rsquo;t have, wait, if you have,</p>
<p>okay, let&rsquo;s start over. Yeah, no. Well, actually, Michelle,</p>
<p>I was just going to say just to kind of like compliment,</p>
<p>I think we know what you&rsquo;re trying to say, right?</p>
<p>We have to be somewhere in the middle. We have to be somewhere in the middle.</p>
<p>But, uh, last month, Aubrey and I did an episode on quiet quitting.</p>
<p>This idea of that, you know,</p>
<p>Gen Z is doing a lot of kind of just doing the bare minimum and maybe stepping</p>
<p>back from work and not investing quite as much.</p>
<p>And we talked about how in some ways that&rsquo;s good because you&rsquo;re going to remain</p>
<p>in touch with family, build your relationships,</p>
<p>build your life outside of work.</p>
<p>But in another way,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to leave a huge gap because we need meaning in our lives as human</p>
<p>beings. Right. Right. I mean, right. Yes, exactly.</p>
<p>Exactly. So that is that reaching part, right?</p>
<p>We need to be reaching for something.</p>
<p>Thank you, Lindsay. Yes. I love it. I love it. My goodness.</p>
<p>What happened to my mind?</p>
<p>Okay. We&rsquo;re just getting started here on the year, right?</p>
<p>So Michelle tell our listeners a little bit more about this five day challenge.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about it.</p>
<p>Okay. So guys, this is amazing.</p>
<p>So five days and you&rsquo;re going to learn something new in</p>
<p>English every day. So that&rsquo;s what Lindsay was talking about.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like kind of this getting the ball rolling. Yes.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s another good expression for our listeners, by the way.</p>
<p>Get that momentum going, the ball rolling. Right.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s one day at a time for five days, but every day, you know,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re growing so you can see this actual improvement and you&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>use all four skills in English. Right, Lindsay?</p>
<p>Yeah. I love the idea. A lot of our listeners,</p>
<p>you guys are always asking us, you know, what about reading?</p>
<p>What about writing? You know, there are, there&rsquo;s more than just speaking,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re going to get all four skills.</p>
<p>This is going to help you to get that headstart, right?</p>
<p>Feel like you&rsquo;re making progress.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re taking that one simple action each day so that at the end of the five</p>
<p>days, you&rsquo;re really going to be on a really different path. Okay.</p>
<p>I love it. And how much time does it take each day to complete the challenge?</p>
<p>Really? Just 30 minutes or less for each challenge. So,</p>
<p>I mean, if you want to spend more time on these daily challenges and projects,</p>
<p>you can. So it&rsquo;s really flexible, like whatever you can or want to put into it.</p>
<p>Um, you know,</p>
<p>so if you feel like you want to really go for it and do more, that&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>But don&rsquo;t think, Oh, well, I really, I don&rsquo;t know if I have the time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really just 30 minutes or less for five days.</p>
<p>Yeah. We&rsquo;ve talked to you guys a lot.</p>
<p>And we know that most of you really just have 30 minutes a day to work on your</p>
<p>English, right? And maybe you add on the podcast in the morning on your way to</p>
<p>work. We&rsquo;ve got 30, 15 to 30 minutes a day.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re going to help you maximize that time, Michelle. So good.</p>
<p>Absolutely. So guys, you will learn something new.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to make a positive change in your life every day for five days.</p>
