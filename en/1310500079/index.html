    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>The following is a conversation with Lee Smolin.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a theoretical physicist,</p>
<p>co inventor of loop quantum gravity,</p>
<p>and a contributor of many interesting ideas</p>
<p>to cosmology, quantum field theory,</p>
<p>the foundations of quantum mechanics,</p>
<p>theoretical biology, and the philosophy of science.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the author of several books,</p>
<p>including one that critiques the state of physics</p>
<p>and string theory called The Trouble with Physics.</p>
<p>And his latest book, Einstein&rsquo;s Unfinished Revolution,</p>
<p>The Search for What Lies Beyond the Quantum.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s an outspoken personality in the public debates</p>
<p>on the nature of our universe,</p>
<p>among the top minds in the theoretical physics community.</p>
<p>This community has its respected academics,</p>
<p>its naked emperors, its outcasts and its revolutionaries,</p>
<p>its madmen and its dreamers.</p>
<p>This is why it&rsquo;s an exciting world to explore</p>
<p>through a long form conversation.</p>
<p>I recommend you listen back to the episodes</p>
<p>with Leonard Susskind, Sean Carroll, Michio Okaku,</p>
<p>Max Tegmark, Eric Weinstein, and Jim Gates.</p>
<p>You might be asking, why talk to physicists</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re interested in AI?</p>
<p>To me, creating artificial intelligence systems</p>
<p>requires more than Python and deep learning.</p>
<p>It requires that we return to exploring</p>
<p>the fundamental nature of the universe and the human mind.</p>
<p>Theoretical physicists venture out into the dark,</p>
<p>mysterious, psychologically challenging place</p>
<p>of first principles more than almost any other discipline.</p>
<p>This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast.</p>
<p>If you enjoy it, subscribe on YouTube,</p>
<p>give it five stars on Apple Podcast,</p>
<p>support it on Patreon, or simply connect with me on Twitter</p>
<p>at Lex Friedman, spelled F R I D M A N.</p>
<p>As usual, I&rsquo;ll do one or two minutes of ads now</p>
<p>and never any ads in the middle</p>
<p>that can break the flow of the conversation.</p>
<p>I hope that works for you</p>
<p>and doesn&rsquo;t hurt the listening experience.</p>
<p>This show is presented by Cash App,</p>
<p>the number one finance app in the App Store.</p>
<p>When you get it, use code LEXBODCAST.</p>
<p>Cash App lets you send money to friends,</p>
<p>buy Bitcoin, and invest in the stock market</p>
<p>with as little as one dollar.</p>
<p>Since Cash App allows you to buy Bitcoin,</p>
<p>let me mention that cryptocurrency</p>
<p>in the context of the history of money is fascinating.</p>
<p>I recommend Ascent of Money as a great book on this history.</p>
<p>Debits and credits on ledgers</p>
<p>started around 30,000 years ago.</p>
<p>The US dollar, of course, created over 200 years ago,</p>
<p>and Bitcoin, the first decentralized cryptocurrency,</p>
<p>was released just over 10 years ago.</p>
<p>So given that history, cryptocurrency is still very much</p>
<p>in its early days of development,</p>
<p>but it still is aiming to</p>
<p>and just might redefine the nature of money.</p>
<p>If you get Cash App from the App Store or Google Play</p>
<p>and use the code LEXBODCAST, you&rsquo;ll get $10,</p>
<p>and Cash App will also donate $10 to First,</p>
<p>one of my favorite organizations</p>
<p>that is helping to advance robotics and STEM education</p>
<p>for young people around the world.</p>
<p>And now, here&rsquo;s my conversation with Lee Smolin.</p>
<p>What is real?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with an easy question.</p>
<p>Put another way, how do we know what is real</p>
<p>and what is merely a creation</p>
<p>of our human perception and imagination?</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>This is science.</p>
<p>I presume we&rsquo;re talking about science.</p>
<p>And we believe, or I believe,</p>
<p>that there is a world that is independent of my existence</p>
<p>and my experience about it and my knowledge of it,</p>
<p>and this I call the real world.</p>
<p>So you said science, but even bigger than science, what?</p>
<p>Sure, sure.</p>
<p>I need not have said this is science.</p>
<p>I just was warming up.</p>
<p>Warming up?</p>
<p>Okay, now that we&rsquo;re warmed up,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s take a brief step outside of science.</p>
<p>Is it completely a crazy idea to you</p>
<p>that everything that exists is merely a creation</p>
<p>of our mind?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a few, not many.</p>
<p>This is outside of science now.</p>
<p>People who believe sort of perception</p>
<p>is fundamentally what&rsquo;s in our human perception,</p>
<p>the visual cortex and so on,</p>
<p>the cognitive constructs that&rsquo;s being formed there</p>
<p>is the reality.</p>
<p>And then anything outside is something</p>
<p>that we can never really grasp.</p>
<p>Is that a crazy idea to you?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a version of that that is not crazy at all.</p>
<p>What we experience is constructed by our brains</p>
<p>and by our brains in an active mode.</p>
<p>So we don&rsquo;t see the raw world.</p>
<p>We see a very processed world.</p>
<p>We feel something that&rsquo;s very processed through our brains</p>
<p>and our brains are incredible.</p>
<p>But I still believe that behind that experience,</p>
<p>that mirror or veil or whatever you wanna call it,</p>
<p>there is a real world and I&rsquo;m curious about it.</p>
<p>Can we truly, how do we get a sense of that real world?</p>
<p>Is it through the tools of physics,</p>
<p>from theory to the experiments?</p>
<p>Or can we actually grasp it in some intuitive way</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s more connected to our ape ancestors?</p>
<p>Or is it still fundamentally the tools of math and physics</p>
<p>that really allow us to grasp it?</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s talk about what tools they are.</p>
<p>What you say are the tools of math and physics.</p>
<p>I mean, I think we&rsquo;re in the same position</p>
<p>as our ancestors in the caves</p>
<p>or before the caves or whatever.</p>
<p>We find ourselves in this world and we&rsquo;re curious.</p>
<p>We also, it&rsquo;s important to be able to explain</p>
<p>what happens when there are fires, when there are not fires,</p>
<p>what animals and plants are good to eat and all that stuff.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;re also just curious.</p>
<p>We look up in the sky and we see the sun and the moon</p>
<p>and the stars and we see some of those move</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re very curious about that.</p>
<p>And I think we&rsquo;re just naturally curious.</p>
<p>So we make, this is my version of how we work.</p>
<p>We make up stories and explanations.</p>
<p>And where there are two things</p>
<p>which I think are just true of being human,</p>
<p>we make judgments fast because we have to.</p>
<p>Where to survive, is that a tiger or is that not a tiger?</p>
<p>And we go.</p>
<p>Act.</p>
<p>We have to act fast on incomplete information.</p>
<p>So we judge quickly and we&rsquo;re often wrong</p>
<p>or at least sometimes wrong, which is all I need for this.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re often wrong.</p>
<p>So we fool ourselves and we fool other people readily.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s lots of stories that get told</p>
<p>and some of them result in a concrete benefit</p>
<p>and some of them don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>So you said we&rsquo;re often wrong,</p>
<p>but what does it mean to be right?</p>
<p>Right, that&rsquo;s an excellent question.</p>
<p>To be right, well since I believe that there is a real world,</p>
<p>I believe that to be, you can challenge me on this</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re not a realist.</p>
<p>A realist is somebody who believes</p>
<p>in this real objective world</p>
<p>which is independent of our perception.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m a realist, I think that to be right</p>
<p>is to come closer.</p>
<p>I think first of all, there&rsquo;s a relative scale.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not right and wrong.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s right or more right and less right.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re more right if you come closer</p>
<p>to an exact true description of that real world.</p>
<p>Now can we know that for sure?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>And the scientific method is ultimately</p>
<p>what allows us to get a sense</p>
<p>of how close we&rsquo;re getting to that real world?</p>
<p>No on two counts.</p>
<p>First of all, I don&rsquo;t believe there&rsquo;s a scientific method.</p>
<p>I was very influenced when I was in graduate school</p>
<p>by the writings of Paul Fireman</p>
<p>who was an important philosopher of science</p>
<p>who argued that there isn&rsquo;t a scientific method.</p>
<p>There is or there is not?</p>
<p>There is not.</p>
<p>Can you elaborate, I&rsquo;m sorry if you were going to,</p>
<p>but can you elaborate on what does it mean</p>
<p>for there not to be a scientific method,</p>
<p>this notion that I think a lot of people believe in</p>
<p>in this day and age?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Paul Fireman, he was a student of Popper</p>
<p>who taught Karl Popper.</p>
<p>And Fireman argued both by logic</p>
<p>and by historical example that you name anything</p>
<p>that should be part of the practice of science.</p>
<p>Say you should always make sure that your theories agree</p>
<p>with all the data that&rsquo;s already been taken.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;ll prove to you that there have to be times</p>
<p>when science contradicts, when some scientist contradicts</p>
<p>that advice for science to progress overall.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not a simple matter.</p>
<p>I think that, I think of science as a community.</p>
<p>Of people.</p>
<p>Of people and as a community of people</p>
<p>bound by certain ethical precepts,</p>
<p>precepts, whatever that is.</p>
<p>So in that community, a set of ideas they operate under,</p>
<p>meaning ethically of kind of the rules of the game</p>
<p>they operate under.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t lie, report all your results,</p>
<p>whether they agree or don&rsquo;t agree with your hypothesis.</p>
<p>Check the training of a scientist.</p>
<p>Mostly consists of methods of checking</p>
<p>because again, we make lots of mistakes.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re very error prone.</p>
<p>But there are tools both on the mathematics side</p>
<p>and the experimental side to check and double check</p>
<p>and triple check.</p>
<p>And a scientist goes through a training</p>
<p>and I think this is part of it.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t just walk off the street and say,</p>
<p>yo, I&rsquo;m a scientist.</p>
<p>You have to go through the training</p>
<p>and the training, the test that lets you be done</p>
<p>with the training is can you form a convincing case</p>
<p>for something that your colleagues</p>
<p>will not be able to shout down</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;ll ask, did you check this?</p>
<p>And did you check that?</p>
<p>And did you check this?</p>
<p>And what about seeming contradiction with this?</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ve got to have answers to all those things</p>
<p>or you don&rsquo;t get taken seriously.</p>
<p>And when you get to the point where you can produce</p>
<p>that kind of defense and argument,</p>
<p>then they give you a PhD.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re kind of licensed.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re still gonna be questioned</p>
<p>and you still may propose or publish mistakes.</p>
<p>But the community is gonna have to waste less time</p>
<p>fixing your mistakes.</p>
<p>Yes, but if you can maybe linger on it a little longer,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the gap between the thing that that community does</p>
<p>and the ideal of the scientific method?</p>
<p>The scientific method is you should be able</p>
<p>to repeat and experiment.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of elements to what construes</p>
<p>the scientific method, but the final result,</p>
<p>the hope of it is that you should be able to say</p>
<p>with some confidence that a particular thing</p>
<p>is close to the truth.</p>
<p>Right, but there&rsquo;s not a simple relationship</p>
<p>between experiment and hypothesis or theory.</p>
<p>For example, Galileo did this experiment</p>
<p>of dropping a ball from the top of a tower</p>
<p>and it falls right at the base of the tower.</p>
<p>And an Aristotelian would say, wow,</p>
<p>of course it falls right to the base of the tower.</p>
<p>That shows that the earth isn&rsquo;t moving</p>
<p>while the ball is falling.</p>
<p>And Galileo says, no way, there&rsquo;s a principle of inertia</p>
<p>and it has an inertia in the direction</p>
<p>where the earth isn&rsquo;t moving and the tower</p>
<p>and the ball and the earth all move together.</p>
<p>When the principle of inertia tells you it hits the bottom,</p>
<p>it does look, therefore my principle of inertia is right.</p>
<p>And Aristotelian says, no, our style of science is right.</p>
<p>The earth is stationary.</p>
<p>And so you gotta get an interconnected bunch of cases</p>
<p>and work hard to line up and explain.</p>
<p>It took centuries to make the transition</p>
<p>from Aristotelian physics to the new physics.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t done until Newton in 1680 something, 1687.</p>
<p>So what do you think is the nature of the process</p>
<p>that seems to lead to progress?</p>
<p>If we at least look at the long arc of science,</p>
<p>of all the community of scientists,</p>
<p>they seem to do a better job of coming up with ideas</p>
<p>that engineers can then take on and build rockets with</p>
<p>or build computers with or build cool stuff with.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, a better job than what?</p>
<p>Than this previous century.</p>
<p>So century by century, we&rsquo;ll talk about string theory</p>
<p>and so on and kind of possible,</p>
<p>what you might think of as dead ends and so on.</p>
<p>Which is not the way I think of string theory.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll straighten out, we&rsquo;ll get all the strings straight.</p>
<p>But there is, nevertheless in science, very often,</p>
<p>at least temporary dead ends.</p>
<p>But if you look at the, through centuries,</p>
<p>the century before Newton and the century after Newton,</p>
<p>it seems like a lot of ideas came closer to the truth</p>
<p>that then could be usable by our civilization</p>
<p>to build the iPhone, right?</p>
<p>To build cool things that improve our quality of life.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the progress I&rsquo;m kind of referring to.</p>
<p>Let me, can I say that more precisely?</p>
<p>Yes, well, it&rsquo;s a low bar.</p>
<p>Because I think it&rsquo;s important to get the time places right.</p>
<p>There was a scientific revolution that partly succeeded</p>
<p>between about 1900 or late 1890s</p>
<p>and into the 1930s, 1940s and so.</p>
<p>And maybe some, if you stretched it, into the 1970s.</p>
<p>And the technology, this was the discovery of relativity</p>
<p>and that included a lot of developments of electromagnetism.</p>
<p>The confirmation, which wasn&rsquo;t really well confirmed</p>
<p>into the 20th century, that matter was made of atoms.</p>
<p>And the whole picture of nuclei with electrons going around,</p>
<p>this is early 20th century.</p>
<p>And then quantum mechanics was from 1905,</p>
<p>took a long time to develop, to the late 1920s.</p>
<p>And then it was basically in final form.</p>
<p>And the basis of this partial revolution,</p>
<p>and we can come back to why it&rsquo;s only a partial revolution,</p>
<p>is the basis of the technologies that you mentioned.</p>
<p>All of, I mean, electrical technology</p>
<p>was being developed slowly with this.</p>
<p>And in fact, there&rsquo;s a close relation</p>
<p>between the development of electricity</p>
<p>and the electrification of cities in the United States</p>
<p>and Europe and so forth.</p>
<p>And the development of the science.</p>
<p>The fundamental physics since the early 1970s</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t have a story like that so far.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not a series of triumphs and progresses</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s not any practical application.</p>
<p>So just to linger briefly on the early 20th century</p>
<p>and the revolutions in science that happened there,</p>
<p>what was the method by which the scientific community</p>
<p>kept each other in check about when you get something right,</p>
<p>when you get something wrong?</p>
<p>Is experimental validation ultimately the final test?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s absolutely necessary.</p>
<p>And the key things were all validated.</p>
<p>The key predictions of quantum mechanics</p>
<p>and of the theory of electricity and magnetism.</p>
<p>So before we talk about Einstein, your new book,</p>
<p>before String Theory, Quantum Mechanics, so on,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s take a step back at a higher level question.</p>
<p>What is that you mentioned?</p>
<p>What is realism?</p>
<p>What is anti realism?</p>
<p>And maybe why do you find realism,</p>
<p>as you mentioned, so compelling?</p>
<p>Well, realism is the belief in an external world</p>
<p>independent of our existence, our perception,</p>
<p>our belief, our knowledge.</p>
<p>A realist as a physicist is somebody who believes</p>
<p>that there should be possible some completely objective</p>
<p>description of each and every process</p>
<p>at the fundamental level, which describes and explains</p>
<p>exactly what happens and why it happens.</p>
<p>That kind of implies that that system,</p>
<p>in a realist view, is deterministic,</p>
<p>meaning there&rsquo;s no fuzzy magic going on</p>
<p>that you can never get to the bottom,</p>
<p>or you can get to the bottom of anything</p>
<p>and perfectly describe it.</p>
<p>Some people would say that I&rsquo;m not that interested</p>
<p>in determinism, but I could live with the fundamental world,</p>
<p>which had some chance in it.</p>
<p>So do you, you said you could live with it,</p>
<p>but do you think God plays dice in our universe?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s probably much worse than that.</p>
<p>In which direction?</p>
<p>I think that theories can change,</p>
<p>and theories can change without warning.</p>
<p>I think the future is open.</p>
<p>You mean the fundamental laws of physics can change?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Oh, okay, we&rsquo;ll get there.</p>
<p>I thought we would be able to find some solid ground,</p>
<p>but apparently the entirety of it, temporarily so, probably.</p>
<p>Okay, so realism is the idea that while the ground</p>
<p>is solid, you can describe it.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the role of the human being,</p>
<p>our beautiful, complex human mind in realism?</p>
<p>Do we have a, are we just another set of molecules</p>
<p>connected together in a clever way,</p>
<p>or the observer, does the observer, our human mind,</p>
<p>consciousness, have a role in this realism view</p>
<p>of the physical universe?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s two ways, there&rsquo;s two questions you could be asking.</p>
<p>One, does our conscious mind, do our perceptions</p>
<p>play a role in making things become,</p>
<p>in making things real or things becoming?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s question one.</p>
<p>Question two is, does this, we can call it</p>
<p>a naturalist view of the world that is based on realism,</p>
<p>allow a place to understand the existence of</p>
<p>and the nature of perceptions and consciousness in mind,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s question two.</p>
<p>Question two, I do think a lot about,</p>
<p>and my answer, which is not an answer, is I hope so,</p>
<p>but it certainly doesn&rsquo;t yet.</p>
<p>So what kind?</p>
<p>Question one, I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>
<p>But of course, the answer to question one</p>
<p>depends on question two.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not up to question one yet.</p>
<p>So question two is the thing that you can kind of</p>
<p>struggle with at this time.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, what about the anti realists?</p>
<p>So what flavor, what are the different camps</p>
<p>of anti realists that you&rsquo;ve talked about?</p>
<p>I think it would be nice if you can articulate</p>
<p>for the people for whom there is not</p>
<p>a very concrete real world, or there&rsquo;s divisions,</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s messier than the realist view of the universe,</p>
<p>what are the different camps, what are the different views?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;m a good scholar and can talk about</p>
<p>the different camps and analyze it,</p>
<p>but some, many of the inventors of quantum physics</p>
<p>were not realists, were anti realists.</p>
<p>Their scholars, they lived in a very perilous time</p>
<p>between the two world wars.</p>
<p>And there were a lot of trends in culture</p>
<p>which were going that way.</p>
<p>But in any case, they said things like,</p>
<p>the purpose of science is not to give an objective</p>
<p>realist description of nature as it would be</p>
<p>in our absence.</p>
<p>This might be saying Niels Bohr.</p>
<p>The purpose of science is as an extension</p>
<p>of our conversations with each other</p>
<p>to describe our interactions with nature.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re free to invent and use terms like</p>
<p>particle, or wave, or causality, or time, or space.</p>
<p>If they&rsquo;re useful to us, and they carry some</p>
<p>intuitive implication, but we shouldn&rsquo;t believe</p>
<p>that they actually have to do with what nature</p>
<p>would be like in our absence,</p>
<p>which we have nothing to say about.</p>
<p>Do you find any aspect of that,</p>
<p>because you kind of said that we human beings</p>
<p>tell stories, do you find aspects of that</p>
<p>kind of anti realist view of Niels Bohr compelling?</p>
<p>That we fundamentally are storytellers,</p>
<p>and then we create tools of space, and time,</p>
<p>and causality, and whatever this fun quantum</p>
<p>mechanic stuff is to help us tell the story of our world.</p>
<p>Sure, I just would like to believe that there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>an aspiration for the other thing.</p>
<p>The other thing being what?</p>
<p>The realist point of view.</p>
<p>Do you hope that the stories will eventually lead us</p>
<p>to discovering the real world as it is?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Is perfection possible, by the way?</p>
<p>Is it? No.</p>
<p>Well that&rsquo;s, you mean will we ever get there</p>
<p>and know that we&rsquo;re there?</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not my, that&rsquo;s for people 5,000 years in the future.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re certainly nowhere near there yet.</p>
<p>Do you think reality that exists outside of our mind,</p>
<p>do you think there&rsquo;s a limit to our cognitive abilities?</p>
<p>Is, again, descendants of apes,</p>
<p>who are just biological systems,</p>
<p>is there a limit to our mind&rsquo;s capability</p>
<p>to actually understand reality?</p>
<p>Sort of, there comes a point,</p>
<p>even with the help of the tools of physics,</p>
<p>that we just cannot grasp some fundamental aspects</p>
<p>of that reality.</p>
<p>Again, I think that&rsquo;s a question</p>
<p>for 5,000 years in the future.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not even close to that limit.</p>
<p>I think there is a universality.</p>
<p>Here, I don&rsquo;t agree with David Deutsch about everything,</p>
<p>but I admire the way he put things in his last book.</p>
<p>And he talked about the role of explanation.</p>
<p>And he talked about the universality of certain languages</p>
<p>or the universality of mathematics</p>
<p>or of computing and so forth.</p>
<p>And he believed that universality,</p>
<p>which is something real,</p>
<p>which somehow comes out of the fact</p>
<p>that a symbolic system or a mathematical system</p>
<p>can refer to itself and can,</p>
<p>I forget what that&rsquo;s called,</p>
<p>can reference back to itself and build,</p>
<p>in which he argued for a universality of possibility</p>
<p>for our understanding, whatever is out there.</p>
<p>But I admire that argument,</p>
<p>but it seems to me we&rsquo;re doing okay so far,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;ll have to see.</p>
<p>Whether there is a limit or not.</p>
<p>For now, we&rsquo;ve got plenty to play with.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>There are things which are right there in front of us</p>
<p>which we miss.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll quote my friend, Eric Weinstein,</p>
<p>in saying, look, Einstein carried his luggage.</p>
<p>Freud carried his luggage.</p>
<p>Marx carried his luggage.</p>
<p>Martha Graham carried her luggage, et cetera.</p>
<p>Edison carried his luggage.</p>
<p>All these geniuses carried their luggage.</p>
<p>And not once before relatively recently</p>
<p>did it occur to anybody to put a wheel on luggage</p>
<p>and pull it.</p>
<p>And it was right there waiting to be invented</p>
<p>for centuries.</p>
<p>So this is Eric Weinstein.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What do the wheels represent?</p>
<p>Are you basically saying that there&rsquo;s stuff</p>
<p>right in front of our eyes?</p>
<p>That once we, it just clicks,</p>
<p>we put the wheels on the luggage,</p>
<p>a lot of things will fall into place.</p>
<p>Yes, I do, I do.</p>
<p>And every day I wake up and think,</p>
<p>why can&rsquo;t I be that guy who was walking through the airport?</p>
<p>What do you think it takes to be that guy?</p>
<p>Because like you said,</p>
<p>a lot of really smart people carried their luggage.</p>
<p>What, just psychologically speaking,</p>
<p>so Eric Weinstein is a good example of a person</p>
<p>who thinks outside the box.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Who resists almost conventional thinking.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re an example of a person who by habit,</p>
<p>by psychology, by upbringing, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>but resists conventional thinking as well,</p>
<p>just by nature.</p>
<p>Thank you, that&rsquo;s a compliment.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a compliment?</p>
<p>Good.</p>
<p>So what do you think it takes to do that?</p>
<p>Is that something you were just born with?</p>
<p>I doubt it.</p>
<p>Well, from my studying some cases,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m curious about that, obviously,</p>
<p>and just in a more concrete way,</p>
<p>when I started out in physics,</p>
<p>because I started a long way from physics,</p>
<p>so it took me a long, not a long time,</p>
<p>but a lot of work to get to study it and get into it,</p>
<p>so I did wonder about that.</p>
<p>And so I read the biographies,</p>
<p>and in fact, I started with the autobiography of Einstein</p>
<p>and Newton and Galileo and all those people.</p>
<p>And I think there&rsquo;s a couple of things.</p>
<p>Some of it is luck, being in the right place</p>
<p>at the right time.</p>
<p>Some of it is stubbornness and arrogance,</p>
<p>which can easily go wrong.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And I know all of these are doorways.</p>
<p>If you go through them slightly at the wrong speed</p>
<p>or in the wrong angle, they&rsquo;re ways to fail.</p>
<p>But if you somehow have the right luck,</p>
<p>the right confidence or arrogance, caring,</p>
<p>I think Einstein cared to understand nature</p>
<p>with ferocity and a commitment that exceeded</p>
<p>other people of his time.</p>
<p>So he asked more stubborn questions.</p>
<p>He asked deeper questions.</p>
<p>I think, and there&rsquo;s a level of ability</p>
<p>and whether ability is born in or can be developed</p>
<p>to the extent to which it can be developed,</p>
<p>like any of these things like musical talent.</p>
<p>So you mentioned ego.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the role of ego in that process?</p>
<p>Confidence.</p>
<p>But in your own life, have you found yourself</p>
<p>walking that nice edge of too much or too little,</p>
<p>so being overconfident and therefore</p>
<p>leaning yourself astray or not sufficiently confident</p>
<p>to throw away the conventional thinking</p>
<p>of whatever the theory of the day, of theoretical physics?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if I, I mean, I&rsquo;ve contributed</p>
<p>where I&rsquo;ve contributed, whether if I had had</p>
<p>more confidence in something, I would have gotten further.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Certainly, I&rsquo;m sitting here at this moment</p>
<p>with very much my own approach to nearly everything.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m calm, I&rsquo;m happy about that.</p>
<p>But on the other hand, I know people</p>
<p>whose self confidence vastly exceeds mine.</p>
<p>And sometimes I think it&rsquo;s justified</p>
<p>and sometimes I think it&rsquo;s not justified.</p>
<p>Your most recent book titled</p>
<p>Einstein&rsquo;s Unfinished Revolution.</p>
<p>So I have to ask, what is Einstein&rsquo;s unfinished revolution</p>
<p>and also how do we finish it?</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;ve been trying to do my whole life,</p>
<p>but Einstein&rsquo;s unfinished revolution</p>
<p>is the twin revolutions which invented relativity theory,</p>
<p>special and especially general relativity,</p>
<p>and quantum theory, which he was the first person</p>
<p>to realize in 1905 that there would have to be</p>
<p>a radically different theory which somehow realized</p>
<p>or resolved the paradox of the duality</p>
<p>of particle and wave for photons.</p>
<p>And he was, I mean, people I think don&rsquo;t always</p>
<p>associate Einstein with quantum mechanics</p>
<p>because I think his connection with it,</p>
<p>founding as one of the founders,</p>
<p>I would say, of quantum mechanics,</p>
<p>he kind of put it in the closet.</p>
<p>Is it?</p>
<p>Well, he didn&rsquo;t believe that the quantum mechanics</p>
<p>as it was developed in the mid to late 1920s</p>
<p>was completely correct.</p>
<p>At first, he didn&rsquo;t believe it at all.</p>
<p>Then he was convinced that it&rsquo;s consistent,</p>
<p>but incomplete, and that also is my view.</p>
<p>It needs, for various reasons, I can elucidate,</p>
<p>to have additional degrees of freedom, particles,</p>
<p>forces, something to reach the stage</p>
<p>where it gives a complete description of each phenomenon,</p>
<p>as I was saying, realism demands.</p>
<p>So what aspect of quantum mechanics</p>
<p>bothers you and Einstein the most?</p>
<p>Is it some aspect of the wave function collapse discussions,</p>
<p>the measurement problem?</p>
<p>Is it the?</p>
<p>The measurement problem.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not gonna speak for Einstein.</p>
<p>But the measurement problem, basically, and the fact that.</p>
<p>What is the measurement problem, sorry?</p>
<p>The basic formulation of quantum mechanics</p>
<p>gives you two ways to evolve situations in time.</p>
<p>One of them is explicitly when no observer is observing</p>
<p>and no measurement is taking place.</p>
<p>And the other is when a measurement</p>
<p>or an observation is taking place.</p>
<p>And they basically contradict each other.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s another reason why the revolution</p>
<p>was incomplete, which is we don&rsquo;t understand</p>
<p>the relationship between these two parts.</p>
<p>General relativity, which became our best theory</p>
<p>of space and time and gravitation and cosmology,</p>
<p>and quantum theory.</p>
<p>So for the most part, general relativity</p>
<p>describes big things.</p>
<p>Quantum theory describes little things.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the revolution that we found</p>
<p>really powerful tools to describe</p>
<p>big things and little things.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s unfinished because we have</p>
<p>two totally separate things and we need to figure out</p>
<p>how to connect them so we can describe everything.</p>
<p>Right, and we either do that if we believe quantum mechanics</p>
<p>as understood now is correct by bringing general relativity</p>
<p>or some extension of general relativity</p>
<p>that describes gravity and so forth</p>
<p>into the quantum domain that&rsquo;s called quantize,</p>
<p>the theory of gravity.</p>
<p>Or if you believe with Einstein</p>
<p>that quantum mechanics needs to be completed,</p>
<p>and this is my view, then part of the job</p>
<p>of finding the right completion</p>
<p>or extension of quantum mechanics</p>
<p>would be one that incorporated space, time, and gravity.</p>
<p>So, where do we begin?</p>
<p>So first, let me ask, perhaps you can give me a chance,</p>
<p>if I could ask you some just really basic questions.</p>
<p>Well, they&rsquo;re not at all.</p>
<p>The basic questions are the hardest,</p>
<p>but you mentioned space, time.</p>
<p>What is space, time?</p>
<p>Space, time, you talked about a construction.</p>
<p>So I believe the space, time is an intellectual construction</p>
<p>that we make of the events in the universe.</p>
<p>I believe the events are real,</p>
<p>and the relationships between the events,</p>
<p>which cause which are real.</p>
<p>But the idea that there&rsquo;s a four dimensional</p>
<p>smooth geometry which has a metric and a connection</p>
<p>and satisfies the equations that Einstein wrote,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a good description to some scale.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good approximation, it captures some</p>
<p>of what&rsquo;s really going on in nature.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t believe it for a minute is fundamental.</p>
<p>So, okay, we&rsquo;re gonna allow me to linger on that.</p>
<p>So the universe has events, events cause other events.</p>
<p>This is the idea of causality.</p>
<p>Okay, so that&rsquo;s real.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s in my.</p>
<p>In your view is real.</p>
<p>Or hypothesis, or the theories that I have been working</p>
<p>to develop make that assumption.</p>
<p>So space, time, you said four dimensional space</p>
<p>is kind of the location of things,</p>
<p>and time is whatever the heck time is.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re saying that space, time is,</p>
<p>both space and time are emergent and not fundamental?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Sorry, before you correct me,</p>
<p>what does it mean to be fundamental or emergent?</p>
<p>Fundamental means it&rsquo;s part of the description</p>
<p>as far down as you go.</p>
<p>We have this notion.</p>
<p>As real.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>As real as real it could be.</p>
<p>Yeah, so I think that time is fundamental,</p>
<p>and quote goes all the way down,</p>
<p>and space does not, and the combination of them</p>
<p>we use in general relativity that we call space time</p>
<p>also does not.</p>
<p>But what is time then?</p>
<p>I think that time, the activity of time</p>
<p>is a continual creation of events from existing events.</p>
<p>So if there&rsquo;s no events, there&rsquo;s no time.</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s not only no time, there&rsquo;s no nothing.</p>
<p>So I believe the universe has a history</p>
<p>which goes to the past.</p>
<p>I believe the future does not exist.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a notion of the present</p>
<p>and a notion of the past,</p>
<p>and the past consists of,</p>
<p>is a story about events that took place to our past.</p>
<p>So you said the future doesn&rsquo;t exist.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Could you say that again?</p>
<p>Can you try to give me a chance to understand that</p>
<p>one more time?</p>
<p>So events cause other events.</p>
<p>What is this universe?</p>
<p>Cause we&rsquo;ll talk about locality and nonlocality.</p>
<p>Good.</p>
<p>Cause it&rsquo;s a crazy, I mean it&rsquo;s not crazy,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a beautiful set of ideas that you propose.</p>
<p>But, and if Kozali is fundamental,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d just like to understand it better.</p>
<p>What is the past?</p>
<p>What is the future?</p>
<p>What is the flow of time?</p>
<p>Even the error of time in our universe, in your view.</p>
<p>And maybe what&rsquo;s an event, right?</p>
<p>Oh, an event is where something changes,</p>
<p>or where two,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard to say because it&rsquo;s a primitive concept.</p>
<p>An event is a moment of time within space.</p>
<p>This is the view in general relativity,</p>
<p>where two particles intersect in their paths,</p>
<p>or something changes in the path of a particle.</p>
<p>Now, we are postulating that there is,</p>
<p>at the fundamental level, a notion,</p>
<p>which is an elementary notion,</p>
<p>so it doesn&rsquo;t have a definition in terms of other things,</p>
<p>but it is something elementary happening.</p>
<p>And it doesn&rsquo;t have a connection to energy,</p>
<p>or matter, or exchange of energy?</p>
<p>It does have a connection to energy and matter.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s at that level.</p>
<p>Yeah, it involves,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s why the version of a theory of events</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve developed with Marina Cortez,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s, by the way, I wanna mention my collaborators,</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;ve been at least as important</p>
<p>in this work as I have.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s Marina Cortez in all the work since about 2013,</p>
<p>2012, 2013, about causality, causal sets.</p>
<p>And in the period before that, Roberta Mangibera Unger,</p>
<p>who is a philosopher and a professor of law.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s in your efforts,</p>
<p>together with your collaborators,</p>
<p>to finish the unfinished revolution.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And focus on causality as a fundamental.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>As fundamental to physics.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s certainly other people we&rsquo;ve worked with,</p>
<p>but those two people&rsquo;s thinking</p>
<p>had a huge influence on my own thinking.</p>
<p>So in the way you describe causality,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what you mean of time being fundamental.</p>
<p>That causality is fundamental.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And what does it mean for space to not be fundamental,</p>
<p>to be emergent?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s very good.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a level of description in which there are events,</p>
<p>there are events create other events,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s no space.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t live in space.</p>
<p>They have an order in which they caused each other.</p>
<p>And that is part of the nature of time for us.</p>
<p>But there is an emergent approximate description.</p>
<p>And you asked me to define emergent.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>An emergent property is a property</p>
<p>that arises at some level of complexity,</p>
<p>larger than and more complex than the fundamental level,</p>
<p>which requires some property to describe it,</p>
<p>which is not directly</p>
<p>explicable or derivable is the word I want</p>
<p>from the properties of the fundamental things.</p>
<p>And space is one of those things</p>
<p>in a sufficiently complex universe,</p>
<p>space, three dimensional position of things emerged.</p>
<p>Yes, and we have this,</p>
<p>we saw how this happens in detail in some models,</p>
<p>both computationally and analytically.</p>
<p>Okay, so connected to space is the idea of locality.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve talked about realism.</p>
<p>So I live in this world that like sports.</p>
<p>Locality is a thing that you can affect things close to you</p>
<p>and don&rsquo;t have an effect on things that are far away.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the thing that bothers me about gravity in general</p>
<p>or action at a distance.</p>
<p>Same thing that probably bothered Newton,</p>
<p>or at least he said a little bit about it.</p>
<p>Okay, so what do you think about locality?</p>
<p>Is it just a construct?</p>
<p>Is it us humans just like this idea</p>
<p>and are connected to it because we exist in it,</p>
<p>we need it for our survival, but it&rsquo;s not fundamental?</p>
<p>I mean, it seems crazy for it not to be</p>
<p>a fundamental aspect of our reality.</p>
<p>It does.</p>
<p>Can you comfort me on a sort of as a therapist,</p>
<p>like how do I?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a good therapist, but I&rsquo;ll do my best.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>There are several different definitions of locality</p>
<p>when you come to talk about locality in physics.</p>
<p>In quantum field theory,</p>
<p>which is a mixture of special relativity</p>
<p>and quantum mechanics,</p>
<p>there is a precise definition of locality.</p>
<p>Field operators corresponding to events in space time,</p>
<p>which are space like separated,</p>
<p>commute with each other as operators.</p>
<p>So in quantum mechanics,</p>
<p>you think about the nature of reality as fields</p>
<p>and things that are close in a field</p>
<p>have an impact on each other more than farther away.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, yes.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s very comforting.</p>
<p>That makes sense.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a property of quantum field theory</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s well tested.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there&rsquo;s another definition of local,</p>
<p>which was expressed by Einstein</p>
<p>and expressed more precisely by John Bell,</p>
<p>which has been tested experimentally and found to fail.</p>
<p>And this set up is you take two particles.</p>
<p>So one thing that&rsquo;s really weird about quantum mechanics</p>
<p>is a property called entanglement.</p>
<p>You can have two particles interact</p>
<p>and then share a property</p>
<p>without it being a property</p>
<p>of either one of the two particles.</p>
<p>And if you take such a system</p>
<p>and then you make a measurement on particle A,</p>
<p>which is over here on my right side,</p>
<p>and particle B, which is over here.</p>
<p>Somebody else makes a measurement of particle B.</p>
<p>You can ask that whatever is the real reality</p>
<p>of particle B, it not be affected by the choice</p>
<p>the observer at particle A makes about what to measure,</p>
<p>not the outcome,</p>
<p>just the choice of the different things they might measure.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a notion of locality</p>
<p>because it assumes that these things</p>
<p>are very far spaced like separated.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s gonna take a while for any information</p>
<p>about the choice made by the people here at A</p>
<p>to affect the reality at B.</p>
<p>But you make that assumption,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s called Bell locality.</p>
<p>And you derive a certain inequality</p>
<p>that some correlations,</p>
<p>functions of correlations have to satisfy.</p>
<p>And then you can test that pretty directly</p>
<p>in experiments which create pairs of photons</p>
<p>or other particles.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s wrong by many sigma.</p>
<p>In experiment, it doesn&rsquo;t match.</p>
<p>So what does that mean?</p>
<p>That means that that definition of locality</p>
<p>I stated is false.</p>
<p>The one that Einstein was playing with.</p>
<p>Yeah, and the one that I stated,</p>
<p>that is it&rsquo;s not true that whatever is real</p>
<p>about particle B is unaffected by the choice</p>
<p>that the observer makes as to what to measure</p>
<p>in particle A.</p>
<p>No matter how long they&rsquo;ve been propagating</p>
<p>at almost the speed of light or the speed of light</p>
<p>away from each other, it&rsquo;s no matter.</p>
<p>So like the distance between them.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s been tested, of course,</p>
<p>if you want to have hope for quantum mechanics</p>
<p>being incomplete or wrong and corrected</p>
<p>by something that changes this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been tested over a number of kilometers.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t remember whether it&rsquo;s 25 kilometers</p>
<p>or a hundred and something kilometers, but.</p>
<p>So in trying to solve the unsolved revolution,</p>
<p>in trying to come up with the theory for everything,</p>
<p>is causality fundamental and breaking away from locality?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>A crucial step.</p>
<p>So in your book, essentially, those are the two things</p>
<p>we really need to think about as a community.</p>
<p>Especially the physics community has to think about this.</p>
<p>I guess my question is, how do we solve?</p>
<p>How do we finish the unfinished revolution?</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s, I can only tell you what I&rsquo;m trying to do</p>
<p>and what I&rsquo;ve abandoned as not working.</p>
<p>As one ant, smart ant in an ant colony.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>Or maybe dumb, that&rsquo;s why, who knows?</p>
<p>But anyway, my view of the,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve had some nice theories invented.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a bunch of different ones.</p>
<p>Both relate to quantum mechanics,</p>
<p>relate to quantum gravity.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot to admire</p>
<p>in many of these different approaches.</p>
<p>But to my understanding,</p>
<p>they, none of them completely solve the problems</p>
<p>that I care about.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;re in a situation</p>
<p>which is either terrifying for a student</p>
<p>or full of opportunity for the right student,</p>
<p>in which we&rsquo;ve got more than a dozen attempts.</p>
<p>And I never thought, I don&rsquo;t think anybody anticipated</p>
<p>it would work out this way.</p>
<p>Which work partly and then at some point,</p>
<p>they have an issue that nobody can figure out</p>
<p>how to go around or how to solve.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the situation we&rsquo;re in.</p>
<p>My reaction to that is twofold.</p>
<p>One of them is to try to bring people,</p>
<p>we evolved into this unfortunate sociological situation</p>
<p>in which there are communities</p>
<p>around some of these approaches.</p>
<p>And to borrow again, a metaphor from Eric,</p>
<p>they sit on top of hills in the landscape of theories</p>
<p>and throw rocks at each other.</p>
<p>And as Eric says, we need two things.</p>
<p>We need people to get off their hills</p>
<p>and come down into the valleys and party and talk</p>
<p>and become friendly and learn to say,</p>
<p>not no but, but yes and yes.</p>
<p>Your idea goes this far,</p>
<p>but maybe if we put it together with my idea,</p>
<p>we can go further.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So in that spirit, I&rsquo;ve talked several times</p>
<p>with Sean Carroll, who&rsquo;s also written</p>
<p>an excellent book recently.</p>
<p>And he kind of, he plays around,</p>
<p>is a big fan of the many worlds interpretation</p>
<p>of quantum mechanics.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m a troublemaker.</p>
<p>So let me ask, what&rsquo;s your sense of Sean</p>
<p>and the idea of many worlds interpretation?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve read many the commentary back and forth.</p>
<p>You guys are friendly, respect each other,</p>
<p>but have a lot of fun debating.</p>
<p>I love Sean and he, no, I really,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s articulate and he&rsquo;s a great representative</p>
<p>or ambassador of science to the public</p>
<p>and for different fields of science to each other.</p>
<p>He also, like I do, takes philosophy seriously.</p>
<p>And unlike what I do in all cases,</p>
<p>he has really done the homework.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s read a lot, he knows the people,</p>
<p>he talks to them, he exposes his arguments to them.</p>
<p>And I, there&rsquo;s this mysterious thing</p>
<p>that we so often end up on the opposite sides</p>
<p>of one of these issues.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fun though.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fun and I&rsquo;d love to have a conversation about that,</p>
<p>but I would want to include him.</p>
<p>I see, about many worlds, well.</p>
<p>No, I can tell you what I think about many worlds.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to, but actually on that, let me pause.</p>
<p>Sean has a podcast.</p>
<p>You should definitely figure out how to talk to Sean.</p>
<p>I would, I actually told Sean,</p>
<p>I would love to hear you guys just going back and forth.</p>
<p>So I hope you can make that happen eventually,</p>
<p>you and Sean.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t tell you what it is,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s something that Sean said to me</p>
<p>in June of 2016 that changed my whole approach to a problem.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ll have to tell him first.</p>
<p>Yes, and that, that&rsquo;ll be great to tell him on his podcast.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t invite myself to his podcast.</p>
<p>But I told him, yeah, okay, we&rsquo;ll make it happen.</p>
<p>So many worlds.</p>
<p>Anyway.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your view?</p>
<p>Many worlds, we talk about nonlocality.</p>
<p>Many worlds is also a very uncomfortable idea</p>
<p>or beautiful depending on your perspective.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very nice in terms of,</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s a realist aspect to it.</p>
<p>I think you called it magical realism.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a beautiful line.</p>
<p>But at the same time,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very difficult to far limited human minds</p>
<p>to comprehend.</p>
<p>So what are your thoughts about it?</p>
<p>Let me start with the easy and obvious</p>
<p>and then go to the scientific.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t appeal to me.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t answer the questions that I want answered.</p>
<p>And it does so to such a strong case</p>
<p>that when Roberto Mangueber Anger and I</p>
<p>began looking for principles,</p>
<p>and I want to come back and talk about</p>
<p>the use of principles in science,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s the other thing I was going to say,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t want to lose that.</p>
<p>When we started looking for principles,</p>
<p>we made our first principle,</p>
<p>there is just one world and it happens once.</p>
<p>But so it&rsquo;s not helpful to my personal approach,</p>
<p>to my personal agenda,</p>
<p>but of course I&rsquo;m part of a community.</p>
<p>And my sense of the many worlds interpretation,</p>
<p>I have thought a lot about it and struggled a lot with it,</p>
<p>is the following.</p>
<p>First of all, there&rsquo;s Everett himself,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s in Everett.</p>
<p>And there are several issues there</p>
<p>connected with the derivation of the Born Rule,</p>
<p>which is the rule that gives probabilities to events.</p>
<p>And the reasons why there is a problem with probability</p>
<p>is that I mentioned the two ways</p>
<p>that physical systems can evolve.</p>
<p>The many worlds interpretation cuts off,</p>
<p>one, the one having to do with measurement,</p>
<p>and just has the other one, the Schrodinger evolution,</p>
<p>which is this smooth evolution of the quantum state.</p>
<p>But the notion of probability is only in the second rule,</p>
<p>which we&rsquo;ve thrown away.</p>
<p>So where does probability come from?</p>
<p>And you have to answer the question</p>
<p>because experimentalists use probabilities</p>
<p>to check the theory.</p>
<p>Now, at first sight, you get very confused</p>
<p>because there seems to be a real problem</p>
<p>because in the many worlds interpretation,</p>
<p>this talk about branches is not quite precise,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ll use it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a branch in which everything that might happen</p>
<p>does happen with probability one in that branch.</p>
<p>You might think you could count the number of branches</p>
<p>in which things do and don&rsquo;t happen</p>
<p>and get numbers that you can define</p>
<p>as something like frequentist probabilities.</p>
<p>And Everett did have an argument in that direction,</p>
<p>but the argument gets very subtle</p>
<p>when there are an infinite number of possibilities,</p>
<p>as is the case in most quantum systems.</p>
<p>And my understanding,</p>
<p>although I&rsquo;m not as much of an expert as some other people,</p>
<p>is that Everett&rsquo;s own proposal failed, did not work.</p>
<p>There are then, but it doesn&rsquo;t stop there.</p>
<p>There is an important idea that Everett didn&rsquo;t know about,</p>
<p>which is decoherence,</p>
<p>and it is a phenomenon that might be very much relevant.</p>
<p>And so a number of people post Everett</p>
<p>have tried to make versions of what you might call</p>
<p>many worlds quantum mechanics.</p>
<p>And this is a big area and it&rsquo;s subtle,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not the kind of thing that I do well.</p>
<p>So I consulted, that&rsquo;s why there&rsquo;s two chapters on this</p>
<p>in the book I wrote.</p>
<p>Chapter 10, which is about Everett&rsquo;s version,</p>
<p>chapter 11, there&rsquo;s a very good group of philosophers</p>
<p>of physics in Oxford, Simon Saunders, David Wallace,</p>
<p>Harvey Brown, and a number of others.</p>
<p>And of course there&rsquo;s David Deutsch, who is there.</p>
<p>And those people have developed and put a lot of work</p>
<p>into a very sophisticated set of ideas</p>
<p>designed to come back and answer that question.</p>
<p>They have the flavor of there are really no probabilities,</p>
<p>we admit that, but imagine if the Everett story was true</p>
<p>and you were living in that multiverse,</p>
<p>how would you make bets?</p>
<p>And so they use decision theory</p>
<p>from the theory of probability and gambling and so forth</p>
<p>to shape a story of how you would bet</p>
<p>if you were inside an Everett in the universe</p>
<p>and you knew that.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a debate among those experts</p>
<p>as to whether they or somebody else has really succeeded.</p>
<p>And when I checked in as I was finishing the book</p>
<p>with some of those people, like Simon,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s a good friend of mine, and David Wallace,</p>
<p>they told me that they weren&rsquo;t sure</p>
<p>that any of them was yet correct.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what I put in my book.</p>
<p>Now, to add to that, Sean has his own approach</p>
<p>to that problem in what&rsquo;s called self referencing</p>
<p>or self locating observers.</p>
<p>And it doesn&rsquo;t, I tried to read it</p>
<p>and it didn&rsquo;t make sense to me,</p>
<p>but I didn&rsquo;t study it hard,</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t communicate with Sean,</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t do the things that I would do,</p>
<p>so I had nothing to say about it in the book.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know whether it&rsquo;s right or not.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk a little bit about science.</p>
<p>You mentioned the use of principles in science.</p>
<p>What does it mean to have a principle</p>
<p>and why is that important?</p>
<p>When I feel very frustrated about quantum gravity,</p>
<p>I like to go back and read history.</p>
<p>And of course, Einstein, his achievements</p>
<p>are a huge lesson and hopefully something</p>
<p>like a role model.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s very clear that Einstein thought</p>
<p>that the first job when you wanna enter a new domain</p>
<p>of theoretical physics is to discover and invent principles</p>
<p>and then make models of how those principles</p>
<p>might be applied in some experimental situation,</p>
<p>which is where the mathematics comes in.</p>
<p>So for Einstein, there was no unified space and time.</p>
<p>Minkowski invented this idea of space time.</p>
<p>For Einstein, it was a model of his principles</p>
<p>or his postulates.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve taken the view that we don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>the principles of quantum gravity.</p>
<p>I can think about candidates and I have some papers</p>
<p>where I discuss different candidates</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m happy to discuss them.</p>
<p>But my belief now is that those partially successful</p>
<p>approaches are all models,</p>
<p>which might describe indeed some quantum gravity physics</p>
<p>in some domain, in some aspect,</p>
<p>but ultimately would be important</p>
<p>because they model the principles</p>
<p>and the first job is to tie down those principles.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the approach that I&rsquo;m taking.</p>
<p>So speaking of principles, in your 2006 book,</p>
<p>The Trouble with Physics, you criticized a bit</p>
<p>string theory for taking us away from the rigors</p>
<p>of the scientific method or whatever you would call it.</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s the trouble with physics today</p>
<p>and how do we fix it?</p>
<p>Can I say how I read that book?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Because I, and I&rsquo;m not, this of course has to be my fault</p>
<p>because you can&rsquo;t as an author claim</p>
<p>after all the work you put in that you are misread.</p>
<p>But I will say that many of the reviewers</p>
<p>who are not personally involved</p>
<p>and even many who were working on string theory</p>
<p>or some other approach to quantum gravity</p>
<p>told me, communicated with me and told me</p>
<p>they thought that I was fair</p>
<p>and balance was the word that was usually used.</p>
<p>So let me tell you what my purpose was in writing that book,</p>
<p>which clearly got diverted by,</p>
<p>because there was already a rather hot argument going on.</p>
<p>And this is.</p>
<p>On which topic?</p>
<p>On string theory specifically?</p>
<p>Or in general in physics?</p>
<p>No, more specifically than string theory.</p>
<p>So since we&rsquo;re in Cambridge, can I say that?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re doing this in Cambridge.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, of course.</p>
<p>Cambridge, just to be clear, Massachusetts.</p>
<p>And on Harvard campus.</p>
<p>Right, so Andy Straminger is a good friend of mine</p>
<p>and has been for many, many years.</p>
<p>And Andy, so originally there was this beautiful idea</p>
<p>that there were five string theories</p>
<p>and maybe they would be unified into one.</p>
<p>And we would discover a way to break that symmetries</p>
<p>of one of those string theories</p>
<p>and discover the standard model</p>
<p>and predict all the properties</p>
<p>of standard model particles,</p>
<p>like their masses and charges and so forth,</p>
<p>coupling constants.</p>
<p>And then there was a bunch of solutions</p>
<p>to string theory found,</p>
<p>which led each of them to a different version</p>
<p>of particle physics with a different phenomenology.</p>
<p>These are called the Calabi Yao manifolds,</p>
<p>named after Yao, who is also here.</p>
<p>Not, certainly we&rsquo;ve been friends</p>
<p>at some time in the past anyway.</p>
<p>And then there were, nobody was sure,</p>
<p>but hundreds of thousands of different versions</p>
<p>of string theory.</p>
<p>And then Andy found there was a way</p>
<p>to put a certain kind of mathematical curvature</p>
<p>called torsion into the solutions.</p>
<p>And he wrote a paper, String Theory with Torsion,</p>
<p>in which he discovered there was,</p>
<p>and not formally uncountable,</p>
<p>but he was unable to invent any way</p>
<p>to count the number of solutions</p>
<p>or classify the diverse solutions.</p>
<p>And he wrote that this is worrying</p>
<p>because doing phenomenology the old fashioned way</p>
<p>by solving the theory is not gonna work</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s gonna be loads of solutions</p>
<p>for every proposed phenomenology</p>
<p>for anything the experiments discovered.</p>
<p>And it hasn&rsquo;t quite worked out that way.</p>
<p>But nonetheless, he took that worry to me.</p>
<p>We spoke at least once, maybe two or three times about that.</p>
<p>And I got seriously worried about that.</p>
<p>And this is just a little.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like an anecdote that inspired</p>
<p>your worry about string theory in general?</p>
<p>Well, I tried to solve the problem</p>
<p>and I tried to solve the problem.</p>
<p>I was reading at that time, a lot of biology,</p>
<p>a lot of evolutionary theory,</p>
<p>like Linmar Gullis and Steve Gould and so forth.</p>
<p>And I could take your time to go through the things,</p>
<p>but it occurred to me,</p>
<p>maybe physics was like evolutionary biology</p>
<p>and maybe the laws evolved.</p>
<p>And there was, the biologists talk about a landscape,</p>
<p>a fitness landscape of DNA sequences</p>
<p>or protein sequences or species or something like that.</p>
<p>And I took their concept and the word landscape</p>
<p>from theoretical biology and made a scenario</p>
<p>about how the universe as a whole could evolve</p>
<p>to discover the parameters of the standard model.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m happy to discuss,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s called cosmological natural selection.</p>
<p>Cosmological natural selection.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Wow, so the parameters of the standard model,</p>
<p>so the laws of physics are changing.</p>
<p>This idea would say that the laws of physics</p>
<p>are changing in some way that echoes</p>
<p>that of natural selection,</p>
<p>or just it adjusts in some way towards some goal.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And I published that,</p>
<p>I wrote the paper in 1888 or 89,</p>
<p>the paper was published in 92.</p>
<p>My first book in 1997,</p>
<p>The Life of the Cosmos was explicitly about that.</p>
<p>And I was very clear that what was important</p>
<p>is that because you would develop an ensemble of universes,</p>
<p>but they were related by descent to natural selection,</p>
<p>almost every universe would share the property</p>
<p>that it was, its fitness was maximized to some extent,</p>
<p>or at least close to maximum.</p>
<p>And I could deduce predictions</p>
<p>that could be tested from that.</p>
<p>And I worked all of that out</p>
<p>and I compared it to the anthropic principle</p>
<p>where you weren&rsquo;t able to make tests</p>
<p>or make falsifications.</p>
<p>All of this was in the late 80s and early 90s.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a really compelling notion,</p>
<p>but how does that help you arrive?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m coming to where the book came from.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So what got me,</p>
<p>I worked on string theory.</p>
<p>I also worked on loop quantum gravity.</p>
<p>And I was one of the inventors of loop quantum gravity.</p>
<p>And because of my strong belief in some other principles,</p>
<p>which led to this notion of wanting a quantum theory</p>
<p>of gravity to be what we call relational</p>
<p>or background independent,</p>
<p>I tried very hard to make string theory</p>
<p>background independent.</p>
<p>And it ended up developing a bunch of tools</p>
<p>which then could apply directly to general relativity</p>
<p>and that became loop quantum gravity.</p>
<p>So the things were very closely related</p>
<p>and have always been very closely related in my mind.</p>
<p>The idea that there were two communities,</p>
<p>one devoted to strings and one devoted to loops is nuts</p>
<p>and has always been nuts.</p>
<p>Okay, so anyway, there&rsquo;s this nuts community</p>
<p>of loops and strings that are all beautiful</p>
<p>and compelling and mathematically speaking.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s the trouble with all that?</p>
<p>Why is that such a problem?</p>
<p>So I was interested in developing that notion</p>
<p>of how science works based on a community</p>
<p>and ethics that I told you about.</p>
<p>And I wrote a draft of a book about that,</p>
<p>which had several chapters on methodology of science.</p>
<p>And it was a rather academically oriented book.</p>
<p>And those chapters were the first part of the book,</p>
<p>the first third of it.</p>
<p>And you didn&rsquo;t find their remnants</p>
<p>in what&rsquo;s now the last part of the trouble with physics.</p>
<p>And then I described a number of test cases, case studies.</p>
<p>And one of them, which I knew was the search</p>
<p>for quantum gravity and string theory and so forth.</p>
<p>And I wasn&rsquo;t able to get that book published.</p>
<p>So somebody made the suggestion of flipping it around</p>
<p>and starting with a story of string theory,</p>
<p>which was already controversial.</p>
<p>This was 2004, 2005.</p>
<p>But I was very careful to be detailed,</p>
<p>to criticize papers and not people.</p>
<p>You won&rsquo;t find me criticizing individuals.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll find me criticizing certain writing.</p>
<p>But in any case, here&rsquo;s what I regret.</p>
<p>Let me make your program worthwhile.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>As far as I know, with the exception of not understanding</p>
<p>how large the applications to condensed matter,</p>
<p>say ADS CFT would get,</p>
<p>I think largely my diagnosis of string theory</p>
<p>as it was then has stood up since 2006.</p>
<p>What I regret is that the same critique,</p>
<p>I was using string theory as an example,</p>
<p>and the same critique applies to many other communities</p>
<p>in science and all of, including,</p>
<p>and this is where I regret my own community,</p>
<p>that is a community of people working on quantum gravity.</p>
<p>Not science string theory.</p>
<p>But, and I considered saying that explicitly.</p>
<p>But to say that explicitly,</p>
<p>since it&rsquo;s a small, intimate community,</p>
<p>I would be telling stories and naming names</p>
<p>and making a kind of history</p>
<p>that I have no right to write.</p>
<p>So I stayed away from that, but was misunderstood.</p>
<p>But if I may ask, is there a hopeful message</p>
<p>for theoretical physics that we can take from that book,</p>
<p>sort of that looks at the community,</p>
<p>not just your own work on,</p>
<p>now with causality and nonlocality,</p>
<p>but just broadly in understanding</p>
<p>the fundamental nature of our reality,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s your hope for the 21st century in physics?</p>
<p>Well, that we solve the problem.</p>
<p>That we solve the unfinished problem of Einstein&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s certainly the thing that I care about most in.</p>
<p>Hope for most.</p>
<p>Let me say one thing.</p>
<p>Among the young people that I work with,</p>
<p>I hear very often and sense a total disinterest</p>
<p>in these arguments that we older scientists have.</p>
<p>And an interest in what each other is doing.</p>
<p>And this is starting to appear in conferences</p>
<p>where the young people interested in quantum gravity</p>
<p>make a conference, they invite loops and strings</p>
<p>and causal dynamical triangulations and causal set people.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re having a conference like this next week,</p>
<p>a small workshop at perimeter.</p>
<p>And I guess I&rsquo;m advertising this.</p>
<p>And then in the summer,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re having a big full on conference,</p>
<p>which is just quantum gravity.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not strings, it&rsquo;s not loops.</p>
<p>But the organizers and the speakers</p>
<p>will be from all the different communities.</p>
<p>And this to me is very helpful.</p>
<p>That the different ideas are coming together.</p>
<p>At least people are expressing an interest in that.</p>
