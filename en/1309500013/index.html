    <p>hello friends how are you</p>
<p>today I hope you&rsquo;re having a wonderful day so far</p>
<p>happy Monday</p>
<p>my name is Bailey</p>
<p>Sarian and today is Monday</p>
<p>welcome to another</p>
<p>episode of Murder Mystery and Makeup Monday</p>
<p>if you are new here</p>
<p>every Monday I sit down I talk</p>
<p>about a true crime</p>
<p>story that&rsquo;s been heavy on my noggin</p>
<p>and I do my makeup</p>
<p>at the same time I do my makeup because I it just like</p>
<p>keeps me busy doing something so that&rsquo;s why I do it</p>
<p>and then we talk</p>
<p>about true crime</p>
<p>if you like true</p>
<p>crime and you like makeup</p>
<p>I would suggest</p>
<p>you subscribe today&rsquo;s</p>
<p>story I want to talk</p>
<p>about Rebecca Za how</p>
<p>and her very mysterious</p>
<p>mysterious case there is just it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just like what the hell</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what it is it&rsquo;s a what the hell case but</p>
<p>other than that</p>
<p>I will stop rambling and let&rsquo;s get into this</p>
<p>tragic story</p>
<p>so this story</p>
<p>like I said is</p>
<p>about Rebecca Zahow</p>
<p>but there is also a lot that kind of went on in the</p>
<p>house most of my stories I kind of try and talk about</p>
<p>the whole family</p>
<p>background and get you give you an idea of</p>
<p>where they come from</p>
<p>essentially but</p>
<p>I just feel like there are so many different names and</p>
<p>people involved in this case that it</p>
<p>could get really overwhelming get to the</p>
<p>point Bailey get to the</p>
<p>point I&rsquo;m gonna</p>
<p>start off with Max</p>
<p>Shaqnai and Max was a 6 year old boy in</p>
<p>2011 is when this happened</p>
<p>and his parents were</p>
<p>Jonah Shaqnai</p>
<p>and Dina Romano</p>
<p>Jonah who was 54 at the time</p>
<p>he was a wealthy CEO</p>
<p>of a pharmaceutical company</p>
<p>who mainly sold</p>
<p>Restelin cosmetic filler</p>
<p>he was a self made billionaire</p>
<p>he had a lot of</p>
<p>money he also had a very stiff face</p>
<p>no that&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>funny so his</p>
<p>primary residence was in Arizona</p>
<p>he would vacation</p>
<p>pretty often</p>
<p>at the Spreckels mansion</p>
<p>in Coronado</p>
<p>California now Coronado</p>
<p>is for one beautiful but all the</p>
<p>houses are millions of dollars I mean</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s for the very rich</p>
<p>and wealthy people</p>
<p>so Jonah and Dina</p>
<p>were together they were married</p>
<p>and then they had the son</p>
<p>named Max and they</p>
<p>divorced in 2008</p>
<p>Rebecca Zahaw</p>
<p>who was 32 her and Jonah Shaqni</p>
<p>were a couple they had met</p>
<p>at a job that Rebecca was working at in Arizona they</p>
<p>seemed very in love and very</p>
<p>happy Rebecca was staying at the Spreckels mansion</p>
<p>in Coronado for the summer</p>
<p>and she was with the family</p>
<p>Max and Jonah</p>
<p>and then her sister</p>
<p>Xena who was 13</p>
<p>she came to</p>
<p>visit from Missouri</p>
<p>so the Spreckels mansion</p>
<p>was the biggest and most beautiful</p>
<p>home in Coronado some reports say that it had</p>
<p>27 bedrooms but actually I looked it up</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s for sale</p>
<p>right now it has</p>
<p>10 bedrooms 11 bathrooms</p>
<p>right on the</p>
<p>ocean it&rsquo;s beautiful</p>
<p>if I say it&rsquo;s one more time</p>
<p>so on July 11th</p>
<p>2011 Rebecca was with her</p>
<p>sister who was</p>
<p>visiting and they were at the</p>
<p>spa breckel&rsquo;s mansion Jonah</p>
<p>he was at work</p>
<p>max was a happy well developed 6 year old boy</p>
<p>his mother reports that he was not a daredevil at all</p>
<p>so somehow that day Max had</p>
<p>taken a pretty bad fall over the</p>
<p>second story banister of the Spreckels mansion</p>
<p>and then that turned into fatal injuries</p>
<p>nobody witnessed</p>
<p>Max fall it&rsquo;s really unclear as to what</p>
<p>caused Max to go over</p>
<p>the banister</p>
<p>there are tons of theories</p>
<p>as to what could have happened he was riding his</p>
<p>scooter and he fell off and</p>
<p>foul play but what</p>
<p>we know for sure</p>
<p>is that Max was</p>
<p>found on the</p>
<p>first floor</p>
<p>with fractured facial bones and a spinal</p>
<p>cord injury</p>
<p>resting on max&rsquo;s leg was his</p>
<p>scooter and the chandelier that was hanging from</p>
<p>the ceiling</p>
<p>it had broken off</p>
<p>and it had fallen</p>
<p>it wasn&rsquo;t on him though</p>
<p>but it had fallen 2</p>
<p>other people present in</p>
<p>the home at the time of max&rsquo;s fall was Rebecca and her</p>
<p>sister both of them reported that</p>
<p>they hadn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>seen Max fall</p>
<p>they had no idea as to what happened Rebecca</p>
<p>had reported that she was in the bathroom at the time</p>
<p>and her sister was</p>
<p>getting ready to like take a shower</p>
<p>so rebecca&rsquo;s in the bathroom and she just</p>
<p>heard just a really loud noise</p>
<p>and then she came running out and she saw that Max</p>
<p>was injured</p>
<p>she called over to her 13 year old</p>
<p>sister call 911</p>
<p>Rebecca says that when she ran out to</p>
<p>go find Max on the</p>
<p>floor that he was conscious and he was saying the word</p>
<p>ocean and Ocean was the name of their dog</p>
<p>so she thought</p>
<p>maybe he was trying to say that</p>
<p>it was the dog that did it</p>
<p>or something but she did tell</p>
<p>first responders</p>
<p>that he was saying the name ocean</p>
<p>first responders</p>
<p>they would later on</p>
<p>testify in court that they overheard</p>
<p>Rebecca saying dina is</p>
<p>going to kill me</p>
<p>and Dina was max</p>
<p>mother when Max was</p>
<p>taken to the children&rsquo;s hospital</p>
<p>Max was unresponsive</p>
<p>and he wasn&rsquo;t breathing</p>
<p>so a lot of people question Rebecca</p>
<p>like well how did he how was he saying ocean</p>
<p>if when he was being</p>
<p>transferred to the hospital</p>
<p>he wasn&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>he wasn&rsquo;t even breathing he wasn&rsquo;t even responsible</p>
<p>a lot of people</p>
<p>started to kind of question</p>
<p>what really happened investigators reported</p>
<p>that Max he played on a scooter</p>
<p>he played with soccer balls like in the hallway area</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s kind of</p>
<p>where he would</p>
<p>play a lot many</p>
<p>have alleged that Max was either like riding his</p>
<p>scooter in the</p>
<p>house and tripped</p>
<p>or either the dog came into</p>
<p>place somehow and he tripped</p>
<p>and fell and then that&rsquo;s how he fell over the railing</p>
<p>grabbed onto the chandelier on his way down</p>
<p>and then there are</p>
<p>others who highly disagree that</p>
<p>this can&rsquo;t even be possible</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no way that this happened max&rsquo;s</p>
<p>mother ended up hiring a private firm</p>
<p>to really look into</p>
<p>max&rsquo;s fall they concluded that max&rsquo;s</p>
<p>center of gravity was far too low to</p>
<p>allow him to go over the railing</p>
<p>along with his</p>
<p>scooter also they said that the shag carpet</p>
<p>in the hallway</p>
<p>it was just way too</p>
<p>thick that it</p>
<p>would have prevented Max</p>
<p>to ride at a</p>
<p>speed that would</p>
<p>throw him over the banister</p>
<p>max he had no cuts on his hands</p>
<p>despite the fact that he supposedly</p>
<p>grabbed the chandelier on the way down but</p>
<p>after this private firm had looked</p>
<p>into max&rsquo;s fall they couldn&rsquo;t even like replicate</p>
<p>how this could have happened</p>
<p>and they concluded</p>
<p>it had to be foul play that was involved</p>
<p>but when the</p>
<p>scooter was</p>
<p>looked at it was shown that on the bottom of the</p>
<p>scooter there was like</p>
<p>white paint and</p>
<p>white markings and some</p>
<p>dents and it</p>
<p>lined up exactly with the</p>
<p>dents that were on the railing of</p>
<p>the staircase</p>
<p>there were some theories that Max was trying to</p>
<p>use his scooter and go down the railing</p>
<p>he ended up falling</p>
<p>and then he</p>
<p>grabbed onto</p>
<p>the chandelier and took that down with them remember</p>
<p>razor scooters</p>
<p>on YouTube and on TV and</p>
<p>stuff you would see</p>
<p>kids using the</p>
<p>scooters to go down</p>
<p>railings to go over</p>
<p>staircases pretty much just act a fool on</p>
<p>their scooters</p>
<p>so some theories were saying that</p>
<p>max was trying to go</p>
<p>down the railing or something and do one of</p>
<p>these tricks he saw</p>
<p>but unfortunately</p>
<p>he ended up falling police investigators</p>
<p>ended up concluding it a terrible and</p>
<p>tragic accident</p>
<p>max was rushed to a local</p>
<p>children&rsquo;s hospital by</p>
<p>ambulance and was in critical condition in ICU</p>
<p>his parents</p>
<p>Dina and Jonah</p>
<p>were right there</p>
<p>by his side</p>
<p>like the entire time it didn&rsquo;t look too good for</p>
<p>so Dina had called up her twin</p>
<p>sister Nina</p>
<p>and Nina flew into town to come</p>
<p>you know be there for her</p>
<p>sister be there for the family</p>
<p>Rebecca went to the airport to pick up Nina</p>
<p>and then Nina</p>
<p>would later say that Rebecca was acting</p>
<p>really strange</p>
<p>whenever she</p>
<p>asked her like what</p>
<p>had happened she was kind of beating around the bush</p>
<p>like she wasn&rsquo;t giving a straight answer the next day</p>
<p>Rebecca also</p>
<p>went down to the airport</p>
<p>to pick up Jonah</p>
<p>his younger brother and his name is Adam</p>
<p>and Adam worked on the</p>
<p>Mississippi</p>
<p>River and he was a</p>
<p>tugboat pilot</p>
<p>since like 1997 so</p>
<p>she picked up Adam</p>
<p>that way the</p>
<p>whole family</p>
<p>could come in and be there to support</p>
<p>max remained on life support in ICU</p>
<p>his condition</p>
<p>did seem to be</p>
<p>stable or even improving Adam Jonah</p>
<p>Rebecca they all</p>
<p>went home for the</p>
<p>night and they had dinner</p>
<p>on July 12 2011</p>
<p>and then Jonah</p>
<p>the dad he went back to the children&rsquo;s hospital</p>
<p>to being next to Max</p>
<p>Adam and Rebecca</p>
<p>ended up staying at the home by themselves</p>
<p>Adam stays out in the</p>
<p>guest house it&rsquo;s fine though</p>
<p>cause the guest</p>
<p>house is massive too and then Rebecca was in the</p>
<p>large house by herself because her</p>
<p>sister had flown back the day before</p>
<p>okay I know</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re getting there</p>
<p>so Adam is in the back</p>
<p>house he reported</p>
<p>saying that he took an Ambien</p>
<p>sleeping pill</p>
<p>and then he fell asleep around 8 pm on July 12</p>
<p>the next morning July 13th at 6 48 am</p>
<p>Adam he called 9 one</p>
<p>one so on this 9 one one call Adam says that he</p>
<p>found a body it was</p>
<p>bound gagged</p>
<p>nude and hanging from the second</p>
<p>story balcony</p>
<p>of the mansion</p>
<p>on the 9 one one call the</p>
<p>first thing you hear Adam say is</p>
<p>yeah got a girl</p>
<p>hung herself at the house</p>
<p>on Ocean Boulevard across</p>
<p>from the hotel</p>
<p>where you guys came yesterday for the boy</p>
<p>like the 911 call is</p>
<p>weird why did</p>
<p>he call her just a girl and he knew who she was</p>
<p>so the whole</p>
<p>thing was just</p>
<p>kinda that was</p>
<p>weird and that will come into play</p>
<p>later on Adam</p>
<p>said that he was</p>
<p>going to get</p>
<p>coffee and then that&rsquo;s when he spotted Rebecca</p>
<p>Adam says when he</p>
<p>found Rebecca she was</p>
<p>completely nude</p>
<p>she was gagged by a long</p>
<p>sleeve blue</p>
<p>t shirt the body of the</p>
<p>t shirt was</p>
<p>wrapped around</p>
<p>her neck 3 times the</p>
<p>sleeves of the T</p>
<p>shirt were double knotted and</p>
<p>stuffed into</p>
<p>her mouth her hands were</p>
<p>bound behind her back and her feet were also bound</p>
<p>rebecca&rsquo;s body was</p>
<p>hanging by a reddish orange rope tied around her neck</p>
<p>the same type of rope was used to bind</p>
<p>her hands and her feet as well the</p>
<p>other end of the rope was tied to the bed</p>
<p>frame in the bedroom in</p>
<p>which Rebecca was</p>
<p>staying Adam says when he saw rebecca&rsquo;s body hanging</p>
<p>that he ran</p>
<p>to the kitchen</p>
<p>he grabbed a</p>
<p>knife and he</p>
<p>grabbed a 3 legged</p>
<p>table he brought it out there so he</p>
<p>could get on the</p>
<p>table and cut the rope</p>
<p>he then says he removed the</p>
<p>t shirt that was around rebecca&rsquo;s neck and in her mouth</p>
<p>he removed that and then he began</p>
<p>to perform CPR</p>
<p>for some odd reason</p>
<p>I guess like this</p>
<p>story had gotten out to news</p>
<p>outlets and then they sent out like a news helicopter</p>
<p>and this helicopter went around the</p>
<p>house they captured</p>
<p>rebecca&rsquo;s body which was</p>
<p>still outside and it</p>
<p>was she was</p>
<p>still naked</p>
<p>she wasn&rsquo;t even covered</p>
<p>and then they showed it on TV</p>
<p>they blurred it</p>
<p>but what the</p>
<p>f are you guys doing</p>
<p>cause the police had already been there</p>
<p>you know I&rsquo;m just a nobody but from my</p>
<p>understanding most of the times at a</p>
<p>crime scene they</p>
<p>cover the body with something but they</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t like they just left Rebecca</p>
<p>out there still nude</p>
<p>on the grass</p>
<p>this made the family extremely upset</p>
<p>I mean Frog</p>
<p>obvious reasons any of us</p>
<p>would be upset if that happened to like one of</p>
<p>our family members why were they showing it on the news</p>
<p>so the San Diego</p>
<p>Medical Examiner he</p>
<p>arrived on the</p>
<p>scene 12 hours</p>
<p>after adam&rsquo;s original 911 call</p>
<p>for 12 hours</p>
<p>rebecca&rsquo;s body was just</p>
<p>still outside</p>
<p>and she wasn&rsquo;t she wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>covered over 12 hours</p>
<p>this made a lot of people</p>
<p>upset they believed it was proof</p>
<p>of a compromised investigation</p>
<p>the medical</p>
<p>examiner he determined that rebecca&rsquo;s official</p>
<p>cause of death was suicide by hanging on her</p>
<p>autopsy report it showed that she had</p>
<p>injury to her neck she had</p>
<p>fractures to the left arm</p>
<p>and also in the autopsy report</p>
<p>there were multiple</p>
<p>scattered like bruises and abrasions</p>
<p>on rebecca&rsquo;s back</p>
<p>arms and legs</p>
<p>autopsy examiner believed that this</p>
<p>happen because Rebecca</p>
<p>Jenna go straight over the balcony</p>
<p>they believe that she fell at an angle</p>
<p>and when she fell she must have like hit</p>
<p>large plants</p>
<p>under the balcony</p>
<p>there really wasn&rsquo;t much around the balcony</p>
<p>for her to hit so yeah</p>
<p>it just is like</p>
<p>hmm are you sure that</p>
<p>they also ran a</p>
<p>toxicology report</p>
<p>and it showed that she had no drugs or alcohol in her</p>
<p>system they</p>
<p>estimated that her time of</p>
<p>death was around 3 am</p>
<p>on July 13 2011</p>
<p>so if we go back</p>
<p>to rebecca&rsquo;s bedroom</p>
<p>a red rope can be seen tied with a slipknot to one</p>
<p>leg of the bed</p>
<p>on the floor near the bed is a plastic garbage bag a</p>
<p>small paintbrush</p>
<p>and a large</p>
<p>paintbrush a</p>
<p>large kitchen</p>
<p>knife and a</p>
<p>small kitchen</p>
<p>knife under</p>
<p>the plastic bag was a tube of</p>
<p>black paint</p>
<p>so rebecca&rsquo;s hands and her feet</p>
<p>they were widely reported in the</p>
<p>media to be nautical knots</p>
<p>the police investigators</p>
<p>they had said that the type of knots utilized</p>
<p>were a cleat</p>
<p>hitch knot and a slipknot</p>
<p>it isn&rsquo;t exactly</p>
<p>inaccurate to describe</p>
<p>these as nautical knots</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not exclusively used in boating</p>
<p>but for the most part they are</p>
<p>used in boating a slipknot is extremely simple</p>
<p>to create but a cleat</p>
<p>hitch knot is</p>
<p>a bit more complicated</p>
<p>this type of knot is most commonly</p>
<p>used in Sailing Now</p>
<p>pop quiz do you remember when I said Adam did as a</p>
<p>profession in the beginning when I</p>
<p>introduced Adam</p>
<p>and he was a</p>
<p>tugboat pilot</p>
<p>since like 1997</p>
<p>now investors</p>
<p>came back and they were like</p>
<p>these are very common knots everybody knows how to use</p>
<p>these knots they&rsquo;re not complicated</p>
<p>to do it&rsquo;s completely overblown by the</p>
<p>media and when I</p>
<p>heard that I was like</p>
<p>bitch shut up no</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re familiar with Coronado at all it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>right on the</p>
<p>water and a lot of people</p>
<p>do own boats there a lot of people do go out on the</p>
<p>water in their</p>
<p>fancy boats</p>
<p>a lot of people</p>
<p>were saying well Rebecca and her boyfriend they</p>
<p>would go out take the boat</p>
<p>and they would go out all the time like</p>
<p>Rebecca would know how to tie</p>
<p>these knots</p>
<p>but rebecca&rsquo;s family</p>
<p>would say that Rebecca</p>
<p>would complain all the time like he</p>
<p>never takes</p>
<p>me out on the boat we only take it out like once a year</p>
<p>we never use the boat if you look at the</p>
<p>pictures like</p>
<p>these knots</p>
<p>they look kind of complicated so also</p>
<p>rebecca&rsquo;s feet were very dirty</p>
<p>and they took a look at the balcony and the balcony</p>
<p>was very dirty</p>
<p>and her footprints</p>
<p>were shown like on the balcony you can see like a V</p>
<p>shape so they saw that</p>
<p>it lined up with why her feet were so</p>
<p>dirty and then they also saw like</p>
<p>little bit of a bootprint</p>
<p>now the police they said it was a police bootprint but</p>
<p>they they didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>test it or anything like that</p>
<p>they just assumed</p>
<p>that it was</p>
<p>the police boot</p>
<p>so we haven&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>mentioned the</p>
<p>painted message</p>
<p>that was in the bedroom</p>
<p>a door in the bedroom there were words that were</p>
<p>painted like a</p>
<p>secret message</p>
<p>that was painted on the door</p>
<p>and it said</p>
<p>she saved him</p>
<p>can you save her</p>
<p>I was about to say suspicious</p>
<p>but like that&rsquo;s just creepy the</p>
<p>whole thing it gives you the</p>
<p>creeps when you see it like what the kind of fucking</p>
<p>shit is going on everybody has</p>
<p>their theories</p>
<p>as to what it means</p>
<p>police have never</p>
<p>figured it out they did not find any</p>
<p>other DNA in the room</p>
<p>besides rebecca&rsquo;s</p>
<p>so then a witness</p>
<p>comes forward</p>
<p>there was a next door</p>
<p>neighbor she had heard</p>
<p>screaming and it</p>
<p>sounded like a</p>
<p>woman and she was</p>
<p>screaming for help and she was just</p>
<p>there was a lot of</p>
<p>screaming she</p>
<p>heard a lot of</p>
<p>screaming happening</p>
<p>so when the</p>
<p>police interviewed this neighbor they were like</p>
<p>they pretty much told her that she was</p>
<p>wrong that she</p>
<p>heard screaming coming from a</p>
<p>different direction</p>
<p>and then they just pretty much</p>
<p>brush this lady off no one ever interviewed her</p>
<p>again rebecca&rsquo;s family contacted</p>
<p>high profile Seattle attorney</p>
<p>her name was Anne</p>
<p>Bremner we&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>gonna call her</p>
<p>Anne and that was in the fall of 2011</p>
<p>and then after reviewing the case details</p>
<p>and she agreed with rebecca&rsquo;s family that the suicide</p>
<p>ruling was suspicious and</p>
<p>Anne actually offered to take rebecca&rsquo;s case pro Bono</p>
<p>so Anne had some pretty like high</p>
<p>connections</p>
<p>she brought in this guy</p>
<p>his name was Dr Uh</p>
<p>wech he was a doctor</p>
<p>a renowned forensic pathologist</p>
<p>and he had over 17 000 autopsies</p>
<p>under his belt</p>
<p>so like he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>seen some shit</p>
<p>so she brings him in</p>
<p>so they decide to do a</p>
<p>second autopsy</p>
<p>but even though like she was</p>
<p>embalmed he</p>
<p>still had like several findings</p>
<p>so there were some</p>
<p>things that this guy</p>
<p>he agreed with</p>
<p>they both noted that there was a lot of damage</p>
<p>to rebecca&rsquo;s</p>
<p>neck she had severely torn muscles in the</p>
<p>front and sides of her neck</p>
<p>well he agreed that</p>
<p>the findings regarding rebecca&rsquo;s neck injuries</p>
<p>are consistent with hanging</p>
<p>they are not exclusive</p>
<p>to just hanging</p>
<p>hanging he believed that they</p>
<p>could also be consistent with strangulation</p>
<p>as the cause of</p>
<p>death and she</p>
<p>found it odd</p>
<p>that rebecca&rsquo;s hair was tucked</p>
<p>under the noose</p>
<p>so she thought this was odd because</p>
<p>many people</p>
<p>especially women</p>
<p>with longer medium to long hair</p>
<p>in most cases they will pull out their hair</p>
<p>from whatever is around</p>
<p>their neck whether it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>shirt collar a noose</p>
<p>she said that most</p>
<p>women when they are</p>
<p>found if they did commit suicide</p>
<p>that their hair will be pulled out it was very</p>
<p>strange that rebecca&rsquo;s hair was not pulled out which</p>
<p>I thought that was so interesting</p>
<p>cause it&rsquo;s little</p>
<p>things like that that you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think about</p>
<p>but are kind of big clues</p>
<p>you know I don&rsquo;t want it to</p>
<p>sound like these are my words because it</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not my words this is coming from and like she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s saying that most women</p>
<p>if they were to commit suicide they</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t do it naked</p>
<p>and that was something that needed to be noted as well</p>
<p>also on both of the autopsy reports</p>
<p>there have been 4 areas like</p>
<p>on top of rebecca&rsquo;s head that there was a hemorrhage</p>
<p>near the top of her</p>
<p>scalp when the</p>
<p>first autopsy was done there</p>
<p>was a theory that Rebecca did not fall straight down</p>
<p>over the railing that</p>
<p>she kind of felt</p>
<p>sideways remember at like an</p>
<p>angle and that</p>
<p>her head came into contact with trees or bushes</p>
<p>or the balcony itself</p>
<p>causing the small</p>
<p>the small hemorrhages</p>
<p>barely get it together</p>
<p>when the second autopsy</p>
<p>was done they were convinced that this was not the case</p>
<p>they believe it</p>
<p>could have been</p>
<p>caused by intentionally inflicted blows to the head</p>
<p>okay so then comes in</p>
<p>levity levity</p>
<p>is pulling of</p>
<p>blood in the body</p>
<p>after death causing purple</p>
<p>or like a purplish</p>
<p>discoloration of the skin so if a person dies on</p>
<p>their back most likely there will be a pool of blood</p>
<p>that would go with the position</p>
<p>of the deceased</p>
<p>so if you die on your back then there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be a pool of</p>
<p>blood like on</p>
<p>your backside</p>
<p>medical examiners they will use levity</p>
<p>to help determine</p>
<p>the time of</p>
<p>death and what position the body was in at the time of</p>
<p>death also be used to determine if the body has been</p>
<p>moved at all</p>
<p>post mortem</p>
<p>levitity it may</p>
<p>begin as soon as 30 minutes</p>
<p>once the person has died becomes</p>
<p>like or permanent</p>
<p>05:56 hours</p>
<p>after death so</p>
<p>when the autopsy was done on Rebecca</p>
<p>the levitity</p>
<p>was fixed in rebecca&rsquo;s back</p>
<p>if Rebecca had died as a result of hanging</p>
<p>then the levitity</p>
<p>would have been</p>
<p>fixed in the</p>
<p>lower limbs</p>
<p>so in the original</p>
<p>autopsy report they said that there was</p>
<p>blood present in</p>
<p>rebecca&rsquo;s vagina</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t that suspicious</p>
<p>they know or they</p>
<p>think that Rebecca was on her period I know</p>
<p>watch all the guys in the room cringe</p>
<p>and thank God she was and we&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>get into that then there was this doctor Dr Goodman</p>
<p>he was another like forensic analysis</p>
<p>but he looked at the images that were provided of the</p>
<p>scene and remember</p>
<p>earlier how we talked</p>
<p>about like there was another footprint</p>
<p>on the balcony</p>
<p>the police officer said well it was a police</p>
<p>boot it&rsquo;s not another footprint it&rsquo;s just a police boot</p>
<p>well this guy Doctor Goodwin he</p>
<p>looked at this</p>
<p>photograph of</p>
<p>the footprint and</p>
<p>then he compared it to like a police boot and whatnot</p>
<p>and he determined that the boot print was</p>
<p>not from police officers</p>
<p>it didn&rsquo;t line up with police officers it didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>line up with Rebecca because Rebecca</p>
<p>was barefoot and he went on the Dr Phil show and</p>
<p>pretty much</p>
<p>broke down all of it didn&rsquo;t make</p>
<p>sense there was somebody else on the balcony</p>
<p>and then oddly enough Dr Goodwin he got forced</p>
<p>off of rebecca&rsquo;s case</p>
<p>but he never</p>
<p>fully explained like why he got forced off</p>
<p>mm hmm so then</p>
<p>guess what there&rsquo;s more</p>
<p>okay when rebecca&rsquo;s</p>
<p>death happened</p>
<p>they took in</p>
<p>you know computers and</p>
<p>stuff for evidence to look at and phones</p>
<p>to look and see</p>
<p>if they could kind of put some</p>
<p>pieces together</p>
<p>right so they took adam&rsquo;s</p>
<p>phone because Adam was at the</p>
<p>house that night anyways so they take adam&rsquo;s phone</p>
<p>and guess what they find on his phone</p>
<p>no I&rsquo;m not judging</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not you&rsquo;re allowed to like this kind of</p>
<p>stuff but like</p>
<p>it fits in with the</p>
<p>story they believe that sometime</p>
<p>on the night of July 12</p>
<p>or even the next like</p>
<p>early next day July 13th somebody</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t say Adam somebody</p>
<p>had searched terms like sexy</p>
<p>Asian girls and</p>
<p>bondage anime</p>
<p>so again even if he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like into that</p>
<p>I mean whatever</p>
<p>but the odd</p>
<p>come on him looking at it the night</p>
<p>before that she gets murdered and she ends up being</p>
<p>bound and what not like</p>
<p>and then of course</p>
<p>police investigators</p>
<p>because they seem to be on team Adam over here they say</p>
<p>that you know somebody must have accessed the computer</p>
<p>now Adam allegedly he did</p>
<p>admit to looking at pornography on</p>
<p>on his iPhone on the morning of July 13th</p>
<p>so then in 2010</p>
<p>rebecca&rsquo;s family they had filed a $10,000,000</p>
<p>civil lawsuit they had</p>
<p>claimed that rebecca&rsquo;s</p>
<p>death was a murder</p>
<p>civil lawsuit itself</p>
<p>named Nina Dina</p>
<p>and Adam and it</p>
<p>claims that</p>
<p>Rebecca was beaten gagged</p>
<p>and strangled before being thrown over the balcony</p>
<p>railing the lawsuit</p>
<p>would eventually drop both Nina and Dina</p>
<p>Nina and Dina both had</p>
<p>solid alibis at the hospital</p>
<p>by her son max&rsquo;s side</p>
<p>video footage</p>
<p>of this as well so</p>
<p>it was pretty solid</p>
<p>and then Dina was at</p>
<p>nina&rsquo;s house</p>
<p>but some like she had an alibi</p>
<p>I think the neighbor saw her</p>
<p>enter the house</p>
<p>but Adam didn&rsquo;t have a</p>
<p>solid alibi so he</p>
<p>still is like the number one focus</p>
<p>so once Dina and Nina</p>
<p>their alibis had come out they came out with</p>
<p>their alibis</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when</p>
<p>oops that&rsquo;s when</p>
<p>rebecca&rsquo;s family</p>
<p>their attorney</p>
<p>Keith Greer</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when</p>
<p>he publicly apologized to both Nina and Dina at a</p>
<p>press conference honestly</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s extremely unusual for an attorney to</p>
<p>make this type of public apology to former defendants</p>
<p>so I thought that was nice</p>
<p>is that the</p>
<p>right word it takes</p>
<p>a big person to</p>
<p>publicly apologize</p>
<p>rebecca&rsquo;s family</p>
<p>alleged that Adam was solely responsible</p>
<p>for murdering Rebecca</p>
<p>in the early morning of July 13</p>
<p>2011 this lawsuit was permitted</p>
<p>to move forward</p>
<p>the civil wrongful</p>
<p>death trial</p>
<p>it began in February of</p>
<p>2018 does the</p>
<p>Hal family is</p>
<p>was being represented by</p>
<p>Keith Greer</p>
<p>the defendant</p>
<p>Adam he was represented by attorney Dan Webb</p>
<p>and Dan Webb</p>
<p>I understand you know</p>
<p>you know okay</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s fine he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>got a job to do Bailey get over it but Dan Webb</p>
<p>was considered like the best of the best he represented</p>
<p>a shit ton of</p>
<p>high profile cases and he was even contacted</p>
<p>by Donald Trump</p>
<p>but Dan had to turn him away because he was</p>
<p>quote unquote</p>
<p>too busy so Dan</p>
<p>tends to represent a lot of the bad guys</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s really good at it too</p>
<p>and in the video I was</p>
<p>watching of the trial Dan</p>
<p>looks like he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>about to die he</p>
<p>is intimidating</p>
<p>not that that matters</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s just a side note he looks like a toad</p>
<p>a side note</p>
<p>about civil</p>
<p>trials in criminal cases</p>
<p>the jury has to determine</p>
<p>that the defendant</p>
<p>is guilty beyond a reasonable</p>
<p>doubt civil</p>
<p>trials also very rarely result</p>
<p>in the defendant being incarcerated</p>
<p>civil trials</p>
<p>generally deal with monetary damages</p>
<p>against the defendant this was a</p>
<p>civil case was because the San Diego Police Department</p>
<p>determined that rebecca&rsquo;s</p>
<p>death was a suicide and they were not willing to reopen</p>
<p>it in order to take Adam to</p>
<p>court so that&rsquo;s why they went the</p>
<p>civil lawsuit way</p>
<p>but the reason the family was doing this wasn&rsquo;t because</p>
<p>of the money</p>
<p>like they went into this knowing that Adam didn&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>money he wasn&rsquo;t a</p>
<p>rich guy his brother was but Adam wasn&rsquo;t wealthy at all</p>
<p>they did it to pretty much</p>
<p>show everybody else</p>
<p>that he is responsible for this in hopes that they</p>
<p>could open this case</p>
<p>and then be able to</p>
<p>put him in jail so Adams lawyers</p>
<p>they argued in their</p>
<p>opening arguments</p>
<p>that there was</p>
<p>absolutely no evidence that placed</p>
<p>Adam at the scene</p>
<p>of rebecca&rsquo;s</p>
<p>death and they had a</p>
<p>point honestly there was no fingerprints</p>
<p>no DNA nothing</p>
<p>and he stated that over and over and over</p>
<p>again to really like</p>
<p>drill it into the juror&rsquo;s head I mean he&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>wrong there isn&rsquo;t any proof</p>
<p>so then Adam gets called to the witness</p>
<p>stand now he is just like</p>
<p>so nonchalant</p>
<p>the way he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>speaking is just</p>
<p>it just sounds I don&rsquo;t know it just is</p>
<p>what demeanor is like</p>
<p>I bet you if he</p>
<p>would have acted remorseful sad</p>
<p>shed some tears I bet you</p>
<p>it would have been a different outcome for him because</p>
<p>they played it so</p>
<p>heavy on the fact that there was no physical evidence</p>
<p>but the way he&rsquo;s acting makes you feel like</p>
<p>what a douche</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s not even like sad or</p>
<p>sorry about what happened</p>
<p>I mean that&rsquo;s my opinion</p>
<p>so then they play the 911 call for the jury of course</p>
<p>because like</p>
<p>the 911 call is so weird</p>
<p>and when Adam calls 911 he</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>refer to Rebecca</p>
<p>by her name he just says that</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got a woman</p>
<p>here who&rsquo;s hanged herself you know when they ask him</p>
<p>about that he&rsquo;s just like well</p>
<p>she was a woman</p>
<p>and so they ask him like</p>
<p>about these</p>
<p>types of knots that are used on Rebecca like what</p>
<p>about these knots do you use</p>
<p>these often</p>
<p>and of course he says</p>
<p>no I have no idea how to tie</p>
<p>those knots</p>
<p>and you just want to roll your eyes to the back</p>
<p>of your head because you&rsquo;re like dude you work on boats</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>anyways then April 2nd</p>
<p>we have like the closing</p>
<p>statements going down and</p>
<p>Keith Greer comes in</p>
<p>he brings in a realistic mannequin</p>
<p>of Rebecca to the courtroom</p>
<p>and it shows</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t show you the</p>
<p>image cause</p>
<p>yeah but it&rsquo;s a lifelike doll</p>
<p>that looks like Rebecca</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s hanging and she&rsquo;s naked and</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s just adding more</p>
<p>shock to what really happened</p>
<p>Keith was able to like</p>
<p>piece together a</p>
<p>solid timeline</p>
<p>as to what happened that</p>
<p>night he believes that Rebecca was in the shower</p>
<p>she turned it off</p>
<p>and then there was a spot of</p>
<p>blood in the shower</p>
<p>from her period</p>
<p>so they know like the</p>
<p>water was off</p>
<p>cause it didn&rsquo;t run the</p>
<p>blood down the</p>
<p>drain once Rebecca gets out of</p>
<p>the shower Adam then confronted her something happens</p>
<p>where she ends up on the opposite side of the house</p>
<p>they know this</p>
<p>because there are drops of</p>
<p>blood a dropped</p>
<p>towel and her cell</p>
<p>phone on the floor</p>
<p>so then they believe that she was</p>
<p>struck on the back of the head 4 times by Adam</p>
<p>by some kind of</p>
<p>object then she was</p>
<p>knocked out</p>
<p>unconscious she was</p>
<p>bound and she and gagged</p>
<p>and then sexually assaulted by Adam</p>
<p>and then he</p>
<p>proceeded to strangle her</p>
<p>before she was hanged</p>
<p>and they believed the motive was</p>
<p>due to rage</p>
<p>about what happened to Max</p>
<p>so then the defense</p>
<p>for their closing</p>
<p>statements and they just go in heavy with</p>
<p>saying over and over</p>
<p>again that there&rsquo;s no evidence proving Adam did this</p>
<p>no fingerprints no DNA</p>
<p>nothing leading back to Adam</p>
<p>and the jurors</p>
<p>determined that Adam</p>
<p>was responsible for the</p>
<p>death of Rebecca</p>
<p>so how so they determined that Adam owed</p>
<p>the family over 5 million dollars in damages</p>
<p>and again they made it</p>
<p>clear in a statement that they knew Adam</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t have money</p>
<p>and it wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>about money they just wanted</p>
<p>to get the sheriff&rsquo;s department to open up this case</p>
<p>do their job</p>
<p>and that it</p>
<p>clearly wasn&rsquo;t a suicide</p>
<p>Adam has always denied all the allegations and</p>
<p>initially appealed the jury&rsquo;s</p>
<p>right after he comes out of</p>
<p>court the media asks him they interview</p>
<p>Adam he&rsquo;s just like</p>
<p>angry right and he calls the</p>
<p>whole family posers</p>
<p>which it&rsquo;s like what the hell does that mean</p>
<p>but it made a lot of people</p>
<p>upset if he</p>
<p>truly is innocent he&rsquo;s being accused of</p>
<p>awful things that were done to Rebecca</p>
<p>of course you have a</p>
<p>right to be angry</p>
<p>he should have gotten like some kind of counsel</p>
<p>or something on how to</p>
<p>act because</p>
<p>the way he was acting towards the media</p>
<p>in certain interviews it&rsquo;s like dude</p>
<p>what are you</p>
<p>doing you&rsquo;re just making yourself look more guilty</p>
<p>he just comes off as a douche</p>
<p>however in February a</p>
<p>judge dismissed the case but noted</p>
<p>the verdict</p>
<p>against Adam</p>
<p>would remain</p>
<p>which I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>quite understand</p>
<p>why they did that</p>
<p>an attorney for Adam said that</p>
<p>while the verdict remains on file</p>
<p>it now lacks legal</p>
<p>standing and</p>
<p>cleared adam&rsquo;s name</p>
<p>the San Diego</p>
<p>County sheriff&rsquo;s Department</p>
<p>reopen the investigation but once</p>
<p>again they determined</p>
<p>in December of</p>
<p>2018 that Rebecca had</p>
<p>taken her own life that</p>
<p>is this awful</p>
<p>story about Rebecca Zhao and also</p>
<p>max poor Max</p>
<p>if foul play was involved with Max I feel so</p>
<p>awful because it</p>
<p>completely got overshadowed my own personal opinion</p>
<p>is I believe that Adam was involved physical evidence</p>
<p>but the fact that</p>
<p>a lot of their</p>
<p>stuff was wiped down is</p>
<p>super suspicious</p>
<p>the fact that the</p>
<p>knife had possibly</p>
<p>been inserted into her is</p>
<p>awful because</p>
<p>how she was tied up all of it is just</p>
<p>weird and then the</p>
<p>saying on the wall like what was that</p>
<p>so rebecca&rsquo;s husband</p>
<p>he wanted the police department</p>
<p>to reopen the case because he did want some closure for</p>
<p>rebecca&rsquo;s family</p>
<p>so he wasn&rsquo;t against it</p>
<p>but he did pay for all the legal</p>
<p>to represent Adam</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s why he got like the best of the best attorney</p>
<p>he didn&rsquo;t believe his brother did it at all but</p>
<p>the guy comes from a lot of</p>
<p>money right</p>
<p>like he&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>self made billionaire</p>
<p>or whatever so he has</p>
<p>all the money in the</p>
<p>world to pay people off</p>
<p>I believe that</p>
<p>maybe he&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>making donations to the police department</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know like</p>
<p>maybe he has some kind of tie</p>
<p>to the police department</p>
<p>where they felt like they needed to be</p>
<p>loyal to him in a way</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s why</p>
<p>they just closed the case and didn&rsquo;t look into it</p>
<p>because if they prosecute the brother then</p>
<p>maybe I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know it just shows though like if you have</p>
<p>money you could get away with anything</p>
<p>and shit like that drives me</p>
<p>fucking bonkers</p>
<p>I would love to hear your theory on this case</p>
<p>but other than that</p>
<p>I appreciate you so much for hanging out with me</p>
<p>today I hope</p>
<p>that you have a really good day you make good choices</p>
<p>and I will be singing you</p>
<p>guys later bye</p>
