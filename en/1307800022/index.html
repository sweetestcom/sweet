    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Hi, everyone. Welcome to this bonus episode of the History of English podcast.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I don&rsquo;t have a new episode of the podcast ready this week.</p>
<p>I hope to have one ready next week.</p>
<p>But the reason I don&rsquo;t have a new episode ready is because I finally committed myself to finishing that alphabet series,</p>
<p>which I&rsquo;ve been mentioning from time to time.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m happy to report that that series is finally ready.</p>
<p>So I wanted to take this opportunity to tell you a little bit about it.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m also going to include a chapter of that series at the end of this episode.</p>
<p>So you will have something new if you listen all the way to the end.</p>
<p>First of all, just to give you a little bit of background about the series,</p>
<p>I decided to do a series about the history of the alphabet after I began the podcast.</p>
<p>A few listeners contacted me after I did the episode about the letter C early on,</p>
<p>and they asked if I was going to explore the history of the other letters of the alphabet.</p>
<p>And at the time, that wasn&rsquo;t really my intention.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s certainly some overlap between the history of the alphabet and the history of English.</p>
<p>But I really intended to bring in the alphabet information in bits and pieces from time to time</p>
<p>when it fit in with what I was discussing in the podcast.</p>
<p>But I gave it some thought, and I finally decided that I was going to go ahead</p>
<p>and put together an extra episode or two dedicated to the alphabet.</p>
<p>But when I started on it, I quickly realized you can&rsquo;t really do the topic justice in just a couple of episodes.</p>
<p>So I gave it some more thought and decided that I was going to go ahead and pursue it</p>
<p>kind of like I did in that early episode about the letter C.</p>
<p>And the net result of all of that is that now that I&rsquo;m done with it,</p>
<p>the series clocks in at about five hours.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a lot of information in there.</p>
<p>The series begins with a look at the overall history of the alphabet,</p>
<p>from the early forms of writing in the Middle East to the early Semitic alphabet,</p>
<p>then the Phoenicians and Greeks and so on.</p>
<p>So some of that information I&rsquo;ve covered in earlier episodes of this podcast,</p>
<p>but the material is much more focused in this series,</p>
<p>and it goes into some additional details that I didn&rsquo;t go into in the podcast.</p>
<p>And then what I do is I actually explore the history of the individual letters.</p>
<p>And just like that episode on the letter C, the history of certain letters is closely connected to other letters.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve grouped the letters together so I can explore them in groups.</p>
<p>And this actually works much better than trying to go through each individual letter.</p>
<p>You can actually see how the various letters are interconnected by doing it that way.</p>
<p>The only portion of the individual letters which I&rsquo;ve previously covered in the podcast is the letter C.</p>
<p>But even that section has been reorganized, and I&rsquo;ve presented it differently.</p>
<p>For example, the history of the letter C is closely connected to the history of the letter Q.</p>
<p>Both letters represent the K sound.</p>
<p>Well, initially in the earlier podcast episode, the letter Q was included in the discussion,</p>
<p>but after I put it together, I realized that it was just too much information in that episode.</p>
<p>It just felt like it was way too much.</p>
<p>So I actually pulled out that information about the letter Q,</p>
<p>and so now I get to put all that information back in.</p>
<p>Also, in the earlier episode about the letter C, I briefly discussed the letter G.</p>
<p>But in this series, it allows me to explore the connections between the G and the C</p>
<p>and the other K-sounding letters in much more detail.</p>
<p>So for example, the same changes that gave us the letter C with the K sound and the S sound,</p>
<p>well, those changes also had a lot to do with why the letter G today has the hard G sound, g,</p>
<p>and the soft G sound, j.</p>
<p>It was part of that same assimilation process.</p>
<p>So anyway, now I can explore those connections as well.</p>
<p>So the question is, how do you get the series?</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m going to try to make it available on iTunes, but this series is not a podcast.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really an audiobook.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a different process for that, and I&rsquo;m not exactly sure when it&rsquo;ll be up on iTunes.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll probably make it available where other audiobooks are available as well.</p>
<p>But for now, you can get the audiobook from my website, historyofenglishpodcast.com.</p>
<p>And all the information is right there on the front page.</p>
<p>And since this series is about five hours long, I&rsquo;ve actually divided it into two separate volumes on the website.</p>
<p>So each file is about two and a half hours long.</p>
<p>Now, I am electing to charge a small fee for the series.</p>
<p>The total cost is $6.</p>
<p>And if you download it from the website, each volume is $3.</p>
<p>So you can buy either one or both.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s up to you.</p>
<p>Again, I&rsquo;m charging a small amount for the series for a couple of reasons.</p>
<p>First, it&rsquo;s taken me quite a bit of time to put it together, so it&rsquo;ll help me cover some of my time and effort in putting it together.</p>
<p>But also because a few listeners have contacted me from time to time and asked if they can make a donation to support the podcast.</p>
<p>And in lieu of taking donations, I decided to do this instead.</p>
<p>So even if you&rsquo;re not particularly interested in the alphabet, this is a way you can support the podcast if you&rsquo;d like to do that.</p>
<p>So, with all that out of the way, I&rsquo;m going to conclude this bonus episode with an excerpt from the audiobook.</p>
<p>This chapter that I&rsquo;m going to give you explores the history of a group of letters which have been the most consistent letters in the alphabet.</p>
<p>These letters still represent the same sounds, and they&rsquo;re still located in the same relative position as the original alphabet.</p>
<p>And the names of the letters have changed, and the shapes of the letters look have changed, but otherwise they remain very consistent.</p>
<p>So, the history of these letters is actually very simple.</p>
<p>So I put them all together, and I call these the constant consonants.</p>
<p>So, I hope you enjoy it.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll begin our look at the individual letters of the alphabet by looking at the core group of letters which have remained more or less constant since the Phoenician alphabet.</p>
<p>Their shapes may have changed, but the sounds they represent and their relative position in the alphabet reflects the remarkable consistency of the alphabet over 3,000 years.</p>
<p>Now, since the original alphabet only had consonants, all of these letters are also consonants.</p>
<p>Remember that the vowels were added later by the Greeks.</p>
<p>The constant consonants are letters B, D, L, M, N, P, R, and T.</p>
<p>These letters are still found in the same order as the original Phoenician alphabet.</p>
<p>And other than their respective shapes and their modern English names, they are direct inheritance from the Phoenicians.</p>
<p>So, let&rsquo;s start with letter B.</p>
<p>Just like our modern letter B, the original letter B was the second letter of the Phoenician alphabet.</p>
<p>And just like today, it represented the B sound, B.</p>
<p>It was originally called Bayet or Beth in the Semitic alphabets.</p>
<p>Remember that originally, the letters were named after objects which began with the sound represented by the letter.</p>
<p>And the physical depiction of the letter was an actual drawing of that particular object or thing.</p>
<p>In the original Semitic languages, the word Bayet or Beth meant house.</p>
<p>So they apparently used this word as the name of the letter since Bayet or Beth began with the B sound.</p>
<p>And to write the letter, they used a simplified version of a house.</p>
<p>The original letter had more of a rectangular or block shape.</p>
<p>Imagine, if you will, the floor plan of a very simple rectangular house with a door at the front.</p>
<p>Now imagine that you open the door and it leads to a hallway down the middle.</p>
<p>Now you might have a shape that sort of looks like a very blocky number 8, a digital 8 if you will.</p>
<p>Now over time, if the two walls on the front side of that house are curved around to the front door, you start to get an uppercase B.</p>
<p>Now that&rsquo;s a very broad generalization of the process which led from the original Semitic house, a Beth, to the modern letter B.</p>
<p>So now if you look at a B, you can imagine the straight line as the back wall of the house</p>
<p>and the point where the two curves meet on the right side as the door or entrance to the house.</p>
<p>By the way, we still see that original Semitic word Beth meaning house in words like Bethlehem meaning house of bread</p>
<p>and Bethesda meaning merciful house and Bethel meaning house of God.</p>
<p>Now when the Greeks borrowed the alphabet from the Phoenicians, they changed the name of the letter from Byatt or Beth to Beta.</p>
<p>And that little ah added to the end to create the name Beta reflects the fact that the Greeks had a lot more vowels than the Semitic languages.</p>
<p>And much of the change in the shape of the letter to the more curvy letter we know today also occurred during the time the Greeks used it.</p>
<p>Now if you look at a depiction of the Greek letter B, you may notice that it appears to be backwards.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s generally drawn so that it faces to the left.</p>
<p>In other words, the straight line is on the right and the two curves are on the left.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s only because the Phoenicians and the early Greeks wrote from right to left.</p>
<p>So it was written so that it faced the left which was the direction of the sentence.</p>
<p>But by around 600 BC, the Greeks had begun to write sentences in a back and forth style so that the first line would go from right to left</p>
<p>and then the next line would go from left to right and then the next line would go back from right to left.</p>
<p>When this happened, the shapes of the letters would flip in each line so that they were always facing in the direction in which the sentence was being written.</p>
<p>By around 500 BC, almost all Greek writing was from left to right like our modern way of writing.</p>
<p>And from that point on, the B is depicted facing to the right as in our modern alphabet.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why our modern letters which are written from left to right are often mirror images of the original Phoenician and Greek letters which were originally written in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>As I noted in an earlier chapter, the Greek word beta was added to the first letter alpha to create the word alphabet.</p>
<p>And this is the same thing we do today when we say the ABCs to refer to all of the letters, not just A, B, and C.</p>
<p>So alpha and beta was just a short way of referring to all of the letters.</p>
<p>Now the Greek letter beta bypassed the Etruscans for the most part.</p>
<p>The Etruscans didn&rsquo;t have a B sound in their language.</p>
<p>That was one of those sounds that linguists call voiced stops.</p>
<p>And the Etruscans didn&rsquo;t use those sounds.</p>
<p>But the Romans did have a B sound.</p>
<p>So they brought it back when they adopted the alphabet from the Etruscans.</p>
<p>The Romans were aware of the Greek version of the alphabet.</p>
<p>So in certain cases they went back and borrowed aspects of the Greek alphabet which were needed to fill in gaps where the phonemes differed from the Etruscan phonemes.</p>
<p>As you may recall, Latin and Greek are related languages within the Indo-European family of languages, which also includes English, by the way.</p>
<p>So that meant that Latin and Greek tended to have a lot of the same sounds or phonemes.</p>
<p>But the Etruscan language was not an Indo-European language.</p>
<p>In fact, its origins are still unknown.</p>
<p>So it had sounds that were quite different from the Greek and the Latin sounds.</p>
<p>So that meant the alphabet underwent some changes as it passed through the Etruscan language before it got to the Romans.</p>
<p>And it also meant that the Romans had to make certain adjustments to make the alphabet fit their language.</p>
<p>So they tended to use the existing Greek alphabet for those adjustments.</p>
<p>And the letter B is one example of that.</p>
<p>Now the Romans called the letter Be, which was a shortened version of the Greek word Beta.</p>
<p>And this pronunciation passed from Latin to French, where it&rsquo;s still the same basic pronunciation for the letter.</p>
<p>It then passed with the Norman French into English after 1066, still called Be.</p>
<p>But around 1500, the pronunciation of the vowels in England started to change.</p>
<p>And the A sound generally shifted to the E sound.</p>
<p>So Be became B.</p>
<p>And the lowercase version of the letter developed during the 5th century by scribes who created a shortened version that was a little bit quicker to write.</p>
<p>They basically dropped the upper curve of the loop.</p>
<p>And again, this was just a quicker way for scribes to write the letter using ink.</p>
<p>The next constant consonant is the letter D.</p>
<p>Again, just like the letter B, it&rsquo;s retained its position in the alphabet since the original Semitic alphabet.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always been the fourth letter.</p>
<p>It was originally called Daleth by the Phoenicians.</p>
<p>And Daleth meant door in the Phoenician language.</p>
<p>The original Semitic letter resembled a triangle shape with rounded lines.</p>
<p>Imagine two lines forming a right angle or a 90 degree angle.</p>
<p>If those lines are connected with a slightly rounded line instead of a straight line, you have some idea of what the original letter looked like.</p>
<p>We might expect that they would have used a square or a rectangle to depict a door, but they didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And scholars are still not exactly sure why they used this more triangular shape.</p>
<p>But when the Greeks borrowed it, they changed the name from Daleth to Delta.</p>
<p>And they straightened out the lines so that the letter was actually more of a proper triangle in Greek.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s how we see it depicted today in fraternity and sorority names.</p>
<p>Now, as writing developed from chisels and stone to ink and parchment, the shape became less rigid and more curvy.</p>
<p>The later Greeks kept a straight line as the backbone of the letter, but they started to convert the other two lines into a single curved line.</p>
<p>And this curved half-moon D shape passed to the Etruscans and eventually to the Romans.</p>
<p>Again, the Etruscans didn&rsquo;t have a D sound in their language.</p>
<p>That was another one of those sounds which linguists call voiced stop, which the Etruscans didn&rsquo;t use.</p>
<p>So the Romans brought it back when they adopted the alphabet because they did have that D sound.</p>
<p>Now, even though the Etruscans didn&rsquo;t really use the letters B and D, their alphabet list, in other words, their ABCs, often included the letters on the list.</p>
<p>And that reflects the fact that it was a borrowed alphabet.</p>
<p>But even though those letters were on the list, they just weren&rsquo;t used by the Etruscans in actual writing.</p>
<p>Now, the Romans called the letter Day.</p>
<p>And again, it passed into French where it&rsquo;s still pronounced Day in modern French.</p>
<p>But that same English vowel shift, which I mentioned earlier, changed the pronunciation to D in English.</p>
<p>The next three constant consonants have always been placed together in the alphabet.</p>
<p>And in fact, these letters are so closely associated with each other that when children pronounce their ABCs,</p>
<p>these three letters and the letter O are often merged together into a new made-up letter, the letter Alamino.</p>
<p>Of course, I&rsquo;m talking about the letters L, M, and N.</p>
<p>The letter L was the 12th letter of the Phoenician alphabet, just like our modern letter L.</p>
<p>The Phoenician letter was called Lamed, and it was shaped like a backwards checkmark.</p>
<p>The name basically meant cattle prod or any type of stick used for prodding livestock.</p>
<p>The checkmark shape reflected the shape of the stick or the prod.</p>
<p>And the Greeks borrowed the letter and called it Lambda.</p>
<p>The Greeks also used the letter so that it faced the direction in which the sentence was being written.</p>
<p>So it resembled a modern checkmark in right-to-left writing, but a reversed checkmark in left-to-right writing like we use today.</p>
<p>The letter then passed through Etruscan and then into Latin.</p>
<p>The Romans eventually flattened that checkmark shape into the right-angled L shape that we have today.</p>
<p>The next letter, M, still occupies the same position today that it did back in the original Phoenician alphabet.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always followed L and preceded N as the 13th letter.</p>
<p>It began as a Semitic letter called Mem, and Mem meant water in the original Semitic languages.</p>
<p>The letter was written as a vertical, wavy, or zigzag line, and it represented waves in water.</p>
<p>And as I said, the Phoenicians took the letter Mem as the 13th letter.</p>
<p>During the time the Phoenicians were using the letter, they began to shift the letter from a vertical wavy line to a horizontal wavy line with a long vertical stem on one end.</p>
<p>And the Greeks took the letter as Mu and shortened that long stem, leaving a mostly horizontal letter.</p>
<p>And the Etruscans and Romans took the same letter.</p>
<p>The Romans eventually eliminated that stem on the end, leaving us with the modern letter M.</p>
<p>Now, just like the prior letters, our modern letter N still occupies the 14th position in the alphabet, a position that it&rsquo;s held since the time the Phoenicians used it.</p>
<p>The original Semitic letter resembled a snake.</p>
<p>Now, the Semitic language had a word, Nahash, which meant snake, and it&rsquo;s believed that this was likely the original name of the letter.</p>
<p>However, by the time of the later Phoenician version of the Semitic alphabet, the letter was called Nun, meaning fish.</p>
<p>So, why did a symbol which originally meant snake, with a name meaning snake, eventually come to mean fish, with a name meaning fish?</p>
<p>Well, keep in mind that both words, Nahash and Nun, started with the N sound.</p>
<p>So, either word would work to represent the N sound in keeping with the Semitic tradition of using objects with a name that began with the sound of the letter.</p>
<p>But why the shift from one object to another, in this case from a snake to a fish?</p>
<p>Well, many modern scholars think that the shift occurred at some point to connect the letter N with the water letter M which preceded it.</p>
<p>Since M was named Mem for water, N was named Nun for fish.</p>
<p>Now, this is one theory, and it should be noted that there are some scholars who think that the letter always meant fish.</p>
<p>But the original shape of the letter suggests a snake, not a fish.</p>
<p>In either case, the letter eventually passed to the Greeks, and the Greeks began to sharpen the curves in the snake-like shape to a more angular shape.</p>
<p>And this again may have been an intentional effort to mimic the shape of the preceding letter M.</p>
<p>The letter then passed into Etruscan, and later into Latin, where the modern N shape finally was adopted.</p>
<p>And if you look at it, an uppercase N still resembles a snake, only it has the sharp angular lines which you get with chisels and stone.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also notable that whereas some letters like B and D have become more rounded and curvy over time,</p>
<p>other letters like M and N have actually become more straight and more angular.</p>
<p>This reflects an earlier period when letters were often written in stone with chisels.</p>
<p>But we do see the more curvy versions of M and N in the lowercase versions of the letters,</p>
<p>which were developed after the Romans when ink writing had become more standard.</p>
<p>Now remember that the original Semitic alphabet didn&rsquo;t have vowels, and that included the Phoenician version of the alphabet as well.</p>
<p>So there was no letter O originally.</p>
<p>Therefore, after the letter N was the letter P.</p>
<p>The original Semitic letter was Pe.</p>
<p>The word meant mouth, and was shaped like a modern letter U or V, which represented a smiling mouth.</p>
<p>Over time, the shape of the letter changed radically, from an original V shape to a cane shape with a hook at the top during the Phoenician period.</p>
<p>And later, during the Roman period, the hook shape closed at the top to form the modern letter P.</p>
<p>So the modern letter P no longer resembles the original version of the letter at all.</p>
<p>So why did the shape of the letter change to its current form?</p>
<p>Well, one theory is that the shape evolved to resemble the letter B.</p>
<p>And in fact, the modern letter P is essentially a modern letter B without the bottom curve portion.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s probably not a coincidence.</p>
<p>The B sound, ba, and the P sound, pa, are closely related sounds.</p>
<p>Linguists would say that the B sound is the voiced version, and the P sound is the unvoiced version.</p>
<p>And even in ancient times, these two sounds were associated with each other.</p>
<p>So this change in shape of the letter P to resemble a letter B may have been a memory device.</p>
<p>The P sound was basically an unvoiced B sound.</p>
<p>So to associate this letter with that B sound, the letter P eventually began to resemble the letter B in many respects.</p>
<p>By the way, as the shape of the letter evolved into its current form within the Etruscan and Roman alphabets,</p>
<p>it also continued to evolve back in Greece within the Greek alphabet.</p>
<p>The Greek letter ultimately took the shape of the symbol we know today as pi in geometry.</p>
<p>And that actually is the Greek version of the letter P.</p>
<p>Now, I mentioned that the letter P bears a certain resemblance to the letter B.</p>
<p>And I noted that that resemblance may not be entirely coincidental.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s another letter that resembled the letter P, and that&rsquo;s the letter R, our next consonant.</p>
<p>And again, the resemblance between P and R is not coincidental.</p>
<p>Letter R, representing the r sound, began with the original Semitic letter called resh.</p>
<p>Resh meant head in the Semitic language.</p>
<p>And to represent this letter, they used an Egyptian hieroglyph of a profile of a man&rsquo;s head.</p>
<p>So think of a modern letter R.</p>
<p>If you delete the diagonal leg of the letter, you&rsquo;re left with a P shape.</p>
<p>And that P shape resembles the profile of a man&rsquo;s head.</p>
<p>The letter had evolved from the Egyptian hieroglyphic symbol into this P shape by the time the Phoenicians were using it.</p>
<p>And the Phoenicians also called the letter resh.</p>
<p>The Greeks took the same letter and called it rho.</p>
<p>The Greeks continued to use that P shape for the letter rho.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s think back for a minute to the letter P.</p>
<p>Remember that P had started off as more of a V-shaped letter.</p>
<p>But by the time the Romans were using it, it had evolved into the modern P shape that we know today,</p>
<p>perhaps to reflect that similarity in sound with the letter B.</p>
<p>So the Romans had the P-shaped letter P.</p>
<p>But they also had this letter for the R sound, which the Greeks called rho.</p>
<p>And it had basically the same shape as P now, since it was derived from the profile of a man&rsquo;s head.</p>
<p>So that meant the Romans needed to distinguish those two letters.</p>
<p>And in order to do that, the Romans added the little extra diagonal leg to the letter we know today as letter R.</p>
<p>And they did it to distinguish it in shape from the letter P.</p>
<p>Now, our last constant consonant is the letter T.</p>
<p>T was the last letter of the Phoenician alphabet.</p>
<p>And just as today, it represented the T sound, t.</p>
<p>It was called ta, and it meant mark, as in a branding mark on animals.</p>
<p>The original letter ta resembled a modern lowercase t with intersecting lines.</p>
<p>And again, you can imagine how this might have been used as a branding symbol during the time of the Phoenicians.</p>
<p>Now, the Greeks took the letter as tau.</p>
<p>And the Greeks had also added the letter u and later some other letters to the end of the alphabet.</p>
<p>So t was no longer the last letter in the Greek alphabet.</p>
<p>The Greeks also tended to eliminate the intersecting lines, thereby creating the modern uppercase T shape.</p>
<p>The T then passed to the Etruscans and then to the Romans.</p>
<p>Around 1200 AD, the modern lowercase t emerged from a writing style in northern Europe called black letter writing.</p>
<p>And for the first time since the Phoenicians, the T finally had a crisscross shape again,</p>
<p>though these scribes didn&rsquo;t have any knowledge of that original T shape used by the Phoenicians.</p>
<p>So there we have it, nine letters, over one third of the modern alphabet.</p>
<p>And they can all be traced back to the original Phoenicians.</p>
<p>The names have changed and many of their shapes have changed,</p>
<p>but the relative position of these letters in the alphabet and the sounds which they represent</p>
<p>are still the same today as they were over 3000 years ago.</p>
