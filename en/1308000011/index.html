    <p>Hey everybody, hey everybody, welcome besties are back. Besties are back. It&rsquo;s another all-in</p>
<p>podcast dropping it to you unexpectedly because there&rsquo;s just so much news.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s too much surprise bestie pods but dropping a bestie. It&rsquo;s not a code 13. We&rsquo;re not dropping</p>
<p>any Snickers bars today. Just dropping a bestie. Oh no, he&rsquo;s got a megaphone.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a special censorship edition. Warning, warning.</p>
<p>We hit a new low in terms of people needing to be heard. Oh my god. By the way, Tramont Sacks</p>
<p>his agent and his chief of staff called me. He felt like he only got 62 percent of the minutes</p>
<p>in the last podcast versus the rest of us. And so I&rsquo;m dealing with his agent a little bit. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like the debates where they count the number of minutes. Who, Daniel? Is Daniel grinding you for</p>
<p>more minutes? Daniel&rsquo;s grinding. No, I go for quality over quantity. Absolutely, okay. Well,</p>
<p>this week&rsquo;s going to be, I mean, what a complete disaster of a week.</p>
<p>Is there no other way to explain what is happening? Every day is a dumpster fire.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a huge dumpster fire. So here we are, we&rsquo;re three weeks out from the election</p>
<p>and somebody&rsquo;s emails have, a Democrat&rsquo;s emails have been leaked again, potentially. But last time</p>
<p>we had an investigation by the FBI and then that might have impacted the election. This time</p>
<p>we have a whole different brouhaha, apparently Hunter Biden, who loves to smoke crack and has</p>
<p>a serious drug problem. This is, you know, he&rsquo;s a seriously, obviously troubled individual,</p>
<p>um, but he brought three laptops to get them fixed and never picked them up according to this story</p>
<p>in the New York post. So the New York post runs a story with an author who is kind of unknown.</p>
<p>And this, these laptops were somehow the hard drives may, he never picked them up.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a little suspicious. The hard drives wind up with Rudy Giuliani and the FBI.</p>
<p>Uh, and anyway, what they say is that Hunter Biden, which we kind of know is a grifter</p>
<p>who traded on his last name to get big consulting deals. I don&rsquo;t know what board anybody here has</p>
<p>been on that pays 50,000 a month. Uh, but it&rsquo;s obviously gnarly stuff, but the, the fallout from</p>
<p>it was the big story. I went to tweet the story and it wouldn&rsquo;t let me tweet the story. Uh, so</p>
<p>the literal New York post was banned by Twitter at the same time, Facebook put a warning on it.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s just put it out there. Um, you know, sacks your guys losing pretty badly in this</p>
<p>election. And so we&rsquo;ll go to our token GOP or what do you think is this let&rsquo;s, let&rsquo;s take this</p>
<p>in two parts. One, what do you, what did they think the chances that this is fake news or real</p>
<p>news or something in between? And then let&rsquo;s get into Twitter&rsquo;s insane decision to block the URL.</p>
<p>Yeah. I mean, so, so first of all, so I, I think this whole thing is a tragedy</p>
<p>of errors on the part of, um, sort of everyone involved. I think the New York post story</p>
<p>stinks. I don&rsquo;t think it, uh, it, it, it meets sort of standards of journalistic</p>
<p>integrity. We can talk about that. Uh, but then I think, you know, Twitter and Facebook overreacted.</p>
<p>And I think that the story was well in the process of being debunked by the internet.</p>
<p>And it was like Twitter and Facebook didn&rsquo;t trust that process to happen. And so they intervened.</p>
<p>And now I think there&rsquo;s going to be a third mistake, which is that conservatives are looking</p>
<p>to repeal section two 30. We should talk about that. And so each one, there&rsquo;s been a cascade of,</p>
<p>of disasters that have led to this, this dumpster fire. But starting with the story, it is, it is,</p>
<p>um, very suspicious. First of all, these disclosures about Hunter Biden&rsquo;s personal</p>
<p>life, they didn&rsquo;t have to go there. It was completely gratuitous to the article. It was</p>
<p>sleazy. And then of course, the story about how the hard drive ends up with the reporters makes</p>
<p>no sense. Even today, uh, Giuliani was, was making up new explanations for how it got there.</p>
<p>Um, it&rsquo;s now being widely speculated that this was the, that the content came from the result</p>
<p>of a hack, um, maybe involving foreign actors, that this whole idea that it came from</p>
<p>this sort of hard drive that he left at a repair shop and forgot to pick up.</p>
<p>Um, I mean, so that, that&rsquo;s now, you know, I think that would have been the story today</p>
<p>if it weren&rsquo;t for, um, Facebook and Twitter making censorship the story.</p>
<p>And then the final thing is, you know, this story wasn&rsquo;t a smoking gun to begin with. I mean,</p>
<p>the worst thing it showed was that there was a single email between a Burisma exec and Joe Biden.</p>
<p>And, um, the, the buying campaign is denied that, that Joe Biden never met with this guy.</p>
<p>And so it wasn&rsquo;t ever the smoking gun. And, um, and, and that makes it all the more, um, apparent</p>
<p>why Facebook and Twitter sort of overreacted. It was almost like they were trying to overprotect</p>
<p>their candidate. Um, but that&rsquo;s the thing that obviously looks crazy. Like they now have given</p>
<p>the GOP, the right, the extreme right, the belief that the, the technology companies are now on the</p>
<p>side of the left. Whereas last time they were on the side of the right, I think, right. Facebook</p>
<p>was supposed to be on the side of the right last time. So Chamath, you worked at Facebook famously</p>
<p>for many years. What are your thoughts? Well, Jack came out last night and basically said that</p>
<p>the reason that they, that they shut down distribution was that it came from hacking</p>
<p>and doxing or some, I think that was basically a combination. Yes. A combination. Um, and then</p>
<p>Facebook today came out and said, you know, before we could take it down, it had been</p>
<p>distributed or read 300,000 times. Um, I mean, look, if we just take a step back and think about</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s happening here, there are more and more and more examples that are telling,</p>
<p>I think all of us, well, we kind of already knew, which is that this fig leaf that</p>
<p>the online internet companies have used to shield themselves from any responsibility,</p>
<p>those days are probably numbered because now exactly as David said, what you have is the left</p>
<p>and the right looking to repeal section two 30. And so, and by the way, two days ago,</p>
<p>I think it was Clarence Thomas basically put out the entire roadmap of how to repeal it.</p>
<p>And if you assume that Amy Coney Barrett gets put into the high court in a matter of days or</p>
<p>whatever, um, it&rsquo;s only a matter of time until the right case is thoughtfully prepared along those</p>
<p>guardrails that, that Clarence Thomas defined, and it&rsquo;ll get, you know, fast tracked through to</p>
<p>the Supreme court. But if I was a betting man, which I am, I think that section two 30 is their</p>
<p>days are numbered and Facebook, Twitter, Google, all these companies are going to have to look</p>
<p>more like newspapers and television stations. Okay. So before we go to your Friedberg,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just going to read what section two 30 is. Uh, this is part of, um, a law basically designed</p>
<p>to protect common carriers, web hosters of legal claims that come from hosting third party</p>
<p>information. Uh, here&rsquo;s what it reads. No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall</p>
<p>be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information</p>
<p>content provider. Uh, so what this basically means is if you put a blog post up</p>
<p>and people comment on it, you&rsquo;re not responsible for their comments. Or if you&rsquo;re a medium and</p>
<p>you host the blog, you&rsquo;re not responsible for the comments of that person is that person&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>it makes complete logical sense. The entire internet was based off of this, that platforms</p>
<p>are not responsible for what people contribute to those platforms. That&rsquo;s how publishing works.</p>
<p>Now look at the internet as paper, but again, let&rsquo;s build on this. When that law was originally</p>
<p>written, we had no conception of social distribution and algorithmic feeds that basically</p>
<p>pumped content and, and increase the volume on those things. So what you have now is really</p>
<p>no different than if, you know, you created a show, um, on Netflix or HBO or CBS and put it</p>
<p>out there. If that stuff contained, you know, something that was really offensive, those</p>
<p>companies are on the hook. Did they make it? No. Did they distribute it? Yes. And it&rsquo;s the,</p>
<p>but here&rsquo;s the difference, but it&rsquo;s the active act of distributing it. You cannot look at these</p>
<p>companies and say they are basically holding their hands back. They have written active code</p>
<p>and there is technical procedures that they are in control of that are both</p>
<p>the amplifier and the kill switch. But isn&rsquo;t this a bad analogy, Netflix, shouldn&rsquo;t it,</p>
<p>the analogy be the person who makes film stock, where the person who makes the camera,</p>
<p>where the person who develops the film, not the person who distributes? No, because that</p>
<p>a limited amount of shows on Netflix, you can police all of them. You can&rsquo;t police everything</p>
<p>written. Netflix is making editorial decisions about which shows to publish, just like,</p>
<p>you know, a magazine makes editorial decisions about which articles to publish. They are clearly</p>
<p>publishers. But the communications DCX section 230, the original distinction, I mean, if you</p>
<p>want to think about like an offline terms for a second, you&rsquo;ve got this idea of publishers and</p>
<p>distributors, right? That&rsquo;s a fundamental dichotomy. A magazine would be a publisher.</p>
<p>The newsstand on which it appears is a distributor. It shouldn&rsquo;t be liable. If there&rsquo;s a libelous</p>
<p>article contained in that magazine, you shouldn&rsquo;t be able to sue every single newsstand in the</p>
<p>country that made that magazine available for sale. That was that was the original offline</p>
<p>law that was then kind of ported over into section 230. It made a lot of sense without this. I mean,</p>
<p>I think it was a really visionary provision that was passed in 1996. Without that every time that</p>
<p>somebody sends an email that, you know, potentially created a legal issue, you know, Gmail could have</p>
<p>been liable. Friedberg, is it? What&rsquo;s the right analogy? When people post to the internet? Is that</p>
<p>the is the analogy of paper or film stock? Is it the newsstand? Or is it the publisher? So remember,</p>
<p>like what sacks is pointing out is this was passed in 1996. So think back to 1996, when you would</p>
<p>create some content, right? And the term around that time was user generated content, right? You</p>
<p>guys remember this, like the early days, it was like the big sweet UGC, UGC. And it was like the</p>
<p>big sweeping trend was like, oh, my God, all this content is being created by the users,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t have to go find content creators to create, you know, a reason for other consumers</p>
<p>to want to come to our websites. So users could create content, you know, blogger was an early</p>
<p>kind of user generated content service, you could create a blog post, you could post it,</p>
<p>and people would show up. The problem with blogger, or the challenge was distribution</p>
<p>or syndication, right? How do I now I&rsquo;ve posted my content? How do I as that content creator,</p>
<p>get people to read my content. And you&rsquo;d have to send people like a link to a website or link to</p>
<p>a web page, and you click on that link, and then you could read it. What Chamath is pointing out</p>
<p>is that today, Twitter and Facebook make a choice about and YouTube make a choice about what content</p>
<p>to show. And so you know, I think the analogy in the offline sense, via the algorithm is what</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re saying to be clear, the algorithm and, you know, YouTube realized that if they showed</p>
<p>you videos that they think that you&rsquo;ll click on, they&rsquo;ll keep you on YouTube longer and make more</p>
<p>money from ads. So it keeps the cycle going. And so they optimize content, and it turns out that</p>
<p>the content that you need to optimize for to get people to keep clicking is content that is somewhat</p>
<p>activating to the amygdala in your brain. It&rsquo;s like stuff that makes you angry, or makes you</p>
<p>super pleasured, and not just boring, ordinary stuff. And so this sort of content, which the</p>
<p>New York Post sells a lot of, is the sort of stuff that rises to the top of those algorithms naturally</p>
<p>because of the way they operate. Now, if a magazine stand were to put those newspapers using</p>
<p>the offline analogy on the front of their magazine stand and told people walking down the street,</p>
<p>hey, you guys should check these out, you know, top of the news is Hunter Biden smoking crack with</p>
<p>a hooker, people would, you know, probably stop. But I think the question is, should they be liable?</p>
<p>Now, in I think 2000, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act was passed. And that act basically</p>
<p>created a process by which folks who felt like, and it was related to copyright,</p>
<p>but I think the analogy is similar. If you thought that your content was copyrighted,</p>
<p>and was being put up falsely, or put up without your permission, you could make a claim to one</p>
<p>of those platforms to get your content pulled down. And I think the question is, is there some</p>
<p>sort of analogy around liable content or false or misleading content, that maybe this evolves</p>
<p>into law, where there&rsquo;s a process by which platforms can kind of be challenged on what</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re showing, much like they are with the DMCA takedown notices. So I think the problem,</p>
<p>the problem comes back to the code. If you explicitly write code, that fundamentally</p>
<p>makes it murky, whether you are the publisher or the distributor, I think that you have to</p>
<p>basically take the approach that you are both. And then you should be subject to the laws of both.</p>
<p>If, for example, Twitter did not have any algorithmic redistribution amplification,</p>
<p>there were the only way you could get content was in a real time feed. That was everything that your</p>
<p>friends posted, and they stayed silent. You could make a very credible claim that they are a</p>
<p>publisher and not a distributor. Which, by the way, is the way it originally worked. And it was</p>
<p>why they were falling behind Facebook, as you well know, because you worked on the algorithm.</p>
<p>You cannot, you cannot claim that you&rsquo;re not a distributor, when you literally have a bunch</p>
<p>of people that sit beside you writing code that decides what is important and what is not,</p>
<p>you can say, but you can debate which signals they decide to use, but it is their choice.</p>
<p>Well, but if the signals are the user&rsquo;s own clicks, then I would argue that&rsquo;s still just</p>
<p>user generated content. No, no, it is a it is a signal, David. But that&rsquo;s not the only</p>
<p>signal. For example, I can tell you very clearly that we would choose a priori stuff that we knew</p>
<p>you would click on. It wasn&rsquo;t necessarily the most heavily clicked. We could make things that</p>
<p>were lightly clicked, more clicked. We could make things that were more clicked, less clicked.</p>
<p>But my point is, there are people inside the bowels of these companies that are deciding what you and</p>
<p>your children see. And to the extent that that&rsquo;s okay, that&rsquo;s okay. Maybe we&rsquo;ve actually solved</p>
<p>this problem. sacks in that, if we said if you deploy an algorithm, that is not disclosing how</p>
<p>this is going, then you are ergo a publisher. And if you are just showing it reverse chronological,</p>
<p>our crown, as we used to call back in the day, with the newest thing up top, that would be</p>
<p>just so maybe we should be not getting rid of 230. We should be talking to these politicians about</p>
<p>algorithms equal publisher. So the publisher at the New York Post</p>
<p>is the same as the algorithm. I like this as a better framework.</p>
<p>Well, yeah. So Senator Tom Cotton, who&rsquo;s a Republican, he tweeted in response to the</p>
<p>New York Post censorship. Look, if you guys are going to act like publishers,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to treat you like publishers. So that&rsquo;s not modifying Section 230. That&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>saying you&rsquo;re not going to qualify for Section 230 protection anymore, if you&rsquo;re going to make</p>
<p>all these editorial decisions. I would argue that these decisions are making about censoring</p>
<p>specific articles. And by the way, it&rsquo;s a total double standard. Because, you know, when when</p>
<p>Trump&rsquo;s tax returns came out a week or two ago, where was the censorship of that that was wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>that hack material. I mean, that was material that found its way to the New York Times without</p>
<p>Trump&rsquo;s consent, by the way, so where the Pentagon Papers, I mean, you cannot apply this standard,</p>
<p>this this idea that we&rsquo;re going to prohibit links to articles,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re proving the point these people are.</p>
<p>No, I don&rsquo;t. Well, well, hold on. I&rsquo;m saying I&rsquo;m saying if they make editorial decisions,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re publishers, I think there&rsquo;s a way for them to employ speech neutral rules,</p>
<p>and remain distributors. So I would be I would have a little bit of an issue with you. I would</p>
<p>say the reason why they&rsquo;re going to fall into this trap of becoming publishers is because of their</p>
<p>own desire to censor their own biases. They can&rsquo;t I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s what it is. I think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>purely market cap driven. If you go from an algorithmic feed to a reverse chronological</p>
<p>feed only, I can tell you what will happen in my opinion, which is that the revenue monetization</p>
<p>on a per page per impression basis will go off by 90% 90% for sure people wouldn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>That is the only reason why these guys won&rsquo;t switch because they know that for every billion</p>
<p>dollars they make today, it would go to 100 million in a reverse chronological feed because</p>
<p>you would not be able to place ads in any coherent valuable way.</p>
<p>There will be zero click throughs and the ads will be just worthless.</p>
<p>Otherwise, they should do it now. If you could keep all the revenue,</p>
<p>and you could be reverse chronological, right and have the same market cap,</p>
<p>just do it and be under safe harbor so that you&rsquo;re not attacked every day.</p>
<p>How fun is it to be sitting there and being attacked every single day by both sides?</p>
<p>And by all the libertarians in the middle, the reason they don&rsquo;t do it is because of money.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just be honest. That&rsquo;s the only reason they don&rsquo;t do it. It&rsquo;s all market cap driven.</p>
<p>Maybe they should go back to just kind of the straight reverse con feed. And maybe you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>right that the I mean, I think you probably are right that the algorithms are make the</p>
<p>situation worse because they kind of trap people in these bubbles of like reinforcement and they</p>
<p>just keep being fed more ideological purity. And it definitely is fueling the polarization</p>
<p>of our society. So I&rsquo;m not trying to defend. I mean, I think maybe you have a point that we</p>
<p>should get rid of these algorithms. But just to think about like the publisher aspect of it,</p>
<p>going back to the newsstand example, let&rsquo;s say that the guy who works at the newsstand knows his</p>
<p>customers, and pulls aside every month the magazines that he knows that his clientele</p>
<p>wants. And in fact, sometimes he even makes recommendations, knowing that oh, okay,</p>
<p>you know, Chamath likes, you know, these three magazines, here&rsquo;s a new one, maybe he&rsquo;ll like</p>
<p>this, and he pulls it aside for you. That would not subject him to publisher liability, even though</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s doing some curation, he&rsquo;s not involved in the content curation. I would argue that if the</p>
<p>algorithms proceed in a speech neutral way, which is just to say, they&rsquo;re going to look at your</p>
<p>clicks, and then based on your own revealed preferences, suggest other things for you to</p>
<p>look at. I don&rsquo;t think that makes you a publisher necessarily. If you if you do, if you do put your</p>
<p>finger, if these engineers are putting their thumb on the scale, and pushing the algorithm</p>
<p>towards certain specific kinds of content that may cross over. No, no, no, you&rsquo;re being you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>being too specific. And it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s not that extreme. And it&rsquo;s not as simple as you&rsquo;re saying.</p>
<p>The reality is there are incredibly intricate models on a per person basis that these companies</p>
<p>use to figure out what you&rsquo;re likely going to click on, not what you should not what is exposed</p>
<p>to you, not what you shouldn&rsquo;t, but what you likely will. And that&rsquo;s part of a much broader</p>
<p>maximization function that includes revenue as a huge driver. So the reality is that these guys</p>
<p>are making publishing decisions. And right, you are right, David, that, you know, the law back</p>
<p>in the day, it didn&rsquo;t scale to the newspaper owner. But you know what, in 1796, you know,</p>
<p>colored people were three fifths of a human, and we figured out a way to change the law.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m pretty sure we can change the law here, too. And I think what&rsquo;s going to happen is,</p>
<p>you should be allowed to be algorithmic, but then you should live and die by the</p>
<p>same rules as everybody else. Otherwise, that is what&rsquo;s really anti competitive</p>
<p>is to essentially lie your way to a market advantage that isn&rsquo;t true,</p>
<p>just because people don&rsquo;t understand what an algorithm is. That&rsquo;s not sufficient to</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re not actually in the content creation business, right? And so</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the what&rsquo;s the definition of a term publisher in that context, because in all</p>
<p>other cases, publishers pay for and guide and direct the editorial creation of the content</p>
<p>versus being a kind of discriminatory function of that content. Here&rsquo;s the problem. Let&rsquo;s take,</p>
<p>for example, Instagram reels. Can you manipulate content through reels? Yes. Now, as the person</p>
<p>that provides that tool to create content that theoretically could be violating other people&rsquo;s</p>
<p>copyright or, you know, offensive or wrong or whatever, and then you yourself distribute it</p>
<p>to other people knowingly. The reality is that the laws need to address in a mature way.</p>
<p>The reality of what is happening today versus trying to harken back to the 1860s and the 1930s,</p>
<p>because things are just different. And we&rsquo;re smart enough as humans to figure out these nuances and</p>
<p>that sometimes we start with good intentions and the laws just need to change. Well, ironically,</p>
<p>Chamath, you&rsquo;re making a point that Clarence Thomas made Justice Thomas made in his</p>
<p>filing recent filing where he said that, that if you are acting as both a publisher and a</p>
<p>distributor, you need to be subject to publish reliability, which means peeling back section 230.</p>
<p>And moreover, you may not even be the primary creator of the content. If you&rsquo;re merely a</p>
<p>secondary creator, if you&rsquo;re someone who has a hand in the content, then you are your creator,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re a publisher, and therefore you should lose section 230 protection. That is basically what he</p>
<p>said. If you if your argument is that the algorithms make you a content creator effectively,</p>
<p>and the tools, algorithms and tools, then the other thing is, you know, what you have the</p>
<p>algorithm, it&rsquo;s monetization, guys, right, but there&rsquo;s monetization involved in the YouTube</p>
<p>example. They are helping you having a serious conversation, Jason, let&rsquo;s not let&rsquo;s not go off</p>
<p>on that. No, but but Chamath, I mean, this goes back to the politics may make strange bedfellows</p>
<p>point. I mean, I think a lot of the conservatives are actually making the point you&rsquo;re making,</p>
<p>which is that these social media sites are involved in publishing. I don&rsquo;t want these guys</p>
<p>involved in any of this shit, because I don&rsquo;t trust them to be neutral over long periods of</p>
<p>time. So do you trust their decision to pull down q anon groups and zero what just like, just like</p>
<p>it took it took years for us to figure out that Holocaust denial was wrong. anti vax was marginal</p>
<p>q anon was crazy, like wearing masks was a good idea, right? I mean, I don&rsquo;t want these people</p>
<p>in charge of any of this stuff. And to the extent that they are, I want them to be liable and</p>
<p>culpable to defend their decisions. So Chamath, your ideal nonprofit social media service would</p>
<p>be a chronological feed of any content anyone wants to publish that anyone can browse.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not what I&rsquo;m saying, David, what I&rsquo;m saying is that you have to be able to</p>
<p>live with the risk that comes with, you know, playing in the big league and wanting to be a</p>
<p>500 plus billion dollar company, there is liability that comes with that. And you need</p>
<p>to own it and live up to the responsibility of what it means. Otherwise, you don&rsquo;t get the free</p>
<p>option. What if they didn&rsquo;t take a hand in it, and they follow the dig, the Reddit model, and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just upvoting that decides what content rises to the top. I suspect that I suspect that so Reddit</p>
<p>has a just a different problem, which is a sort of like, you know, a decency problem and a different</p>
<p>class of law, who are we to judge decency, right? I mean, like, in the vein of like editorialism,</p>
<p>like they&rsquo;re taking no hand in what content rises to the top.</p>
<p>Well, they did ban certain topics. So they did recently, but like, like, assume they didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>write and it was just purely like upvoted consumer and not algorithmic.</p>
<p>That it&rsquo;s very hard to pin up. I think it&rsquo;s like a platform to me.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s very hard to pin a section 230 claim on Reddit, as easy as it is YouTube,</p>
<p>Facebook and Twitter. And so if YouTube reverted to just hey, what people are watching right now</p>
<p>rises to the top, and that was the only thing that drove the algorithm, you would feel more</p>
<p>comfortable with YouTube not being. It&rsquo;s not comfortable. This is what I&rsquo;m saying.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s what I know. All I want to know is what am I getting when I go here? And if what I&rsquo;m getting is</p>
<p>a subjective function where they are maximizing revenue, which means that I can&rsquo;t necessarily</p>
<p>trust the content I get as long as I know that. And as long as there&rsquo;s recourse for me,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m I&rsquo;m very fine to use YouTube and Twitter and Facebook. What I think is unfair is to not know</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a subjective function, confuse it with an objective function, go on with your life,</p>
<p>end up in the state that we&rsquo;re in now where nobody is happy and everybody is throwing barbs.</p>
<p>But and you have no solution. Maybe I just want to be stimulated. Like I remember the day when I</p>
<p>would go to Facebook and Twitter and it was boring as hell. It&rsquo;s like just fucking random shit that</p>
<p>people like here&rsquo;s a picture of my show. You know, like like now I go to Facebook and I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>like fucking addicted because it&rsquo;s showing me this. And there&rsquo;s like shit that I&rsquo;ve been buying</p>
<p>online and the ads keep popping up. And I&rsquo;m like, oh, this is awesome. And I keep buying more stuff.</p>
<p>I think all of that is good. But I it&rsquo;s all it all should be done. Eyes wide open,</p>
<p>where in these corner cases, the people that feel like some sort of right or privilege</p>
<p>or has been violated or some overstepping has occurred, they should have some legal recourse</p>
<p>and they should be there should be on the record a mechanism to disambiguate.</p>
<p>Wait, hold on. Here&rsquo;s one question, David. Would this be alleviated if the algorithm</p>
<p>was less of a black box? If we could just say, hey, no, we need these algorithms to be. So that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not a solution. And then what is this? And I want to hear about that and then also labeling</p>
<p>because Facebook labeled stuff. And if labeling stuff, hey, this is disputed from a third party,</p>
<p>that feels to me like that would have been a better solution in the first case.</p>
<p>All right, let me get in here. So I half agree with Chamath. Okay. So the half I agree with is</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want any of these people, meaning the social media sites, making editorial decisions</p>
<p>about what I see, censoring what I can look at. I don&rsquo;t trust them. I don&rsquo;t want that kind of power</p>
<p>residing in really two people&rsquo;s hands, Mark Zuckerberg and Jack Dorsey. I don&rsquo;t trust them.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t want them to have that kind of power. But that where I disagree is if you</p>
<p>repeal section 230, you&rsquo;re going to make the situation infinitely worse. Because section two,</p>
<p>what is the response to these companies going to be corporate risk aversion is going to cause them</p>
<p>to want to hire hundreds of low level employees, basically millennials to sit there making</p>
<p>judgments about what content might be defamatory might cause a lawsuit, they&rsquo;re going to be</p>
<p>taking down content all over the place. And you know what will happen to be a worse world? No,</p>
<p>you know what will happen? Those companies will lose users lose engagement and new things will</p>
<p>spring up in its place around these laws that work. How will they how will they lose audience?</p>
<p>I mean, I think what will happen is you&rsquo;ll have a torrent of lawsuits. Anytime somebody has a</p>
<p>potential lawsuit based on you know, like trying to police speech at a dinner party, like, our job</p>
<p>never existed at scale. This is never existed at the scale. I don&rsquo;t think the goal is to work</p>
<p>backwards from how do we preserve a trillion dollars of market cap. So what if that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>happens? I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re doing. So for me, I&rsquo;m trying to work back from how do</p>
<p>we preserve the open internet. But I think this is exactly what it&rsquo;s saying, which is,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s a clear delineation in 2020. Knowing what we know, you know, person entrepreneur who goes</p>
<p>to Y Combinator or to launch to build the next great company. Here are these rules, pick your</p>
<p>poison. And some will choose to be just a publisher. Some will probably create forms of distribution,</p>
<p>we can&rsquo;t even think of, some will choose to straddle the line, they&rsquo;ll have different risk</p>
<p>spectrums that they live on. And that&rsquo;s exactly how the free markets work today. There&rsquo;s nothing</p>
<p>wrong with that. Maybe the only like disagreement here is that I think that code can be written and</p>
<p>algorithms can be written in a speech neutral way, so that the distributors don&rsquo;t cross over</p>
<p>the line to becoming publishers. I fully agree with you that these sites should not be publishers.</p>
<p>The reason why the New York Post story should be taken off, they should be platforms and they</p>
<p>cross the line. I would say that this this New York Post story is the reason why people are up</p>
<p>in arms about it is because what Twitter and Facebook have done is basically said they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to sit in judgment of the media industry. And if a publisher like the New York Post puts</p>
<p>out a story that doesn&rsquo;t meet the standards of Twitter and Facebook, they&rsquo;re going to censor</p>
<p>them. That is a sweeping assertion of power. They&rsquo;re picking and choosing who they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>want to give distribution to. Yeah, we all we all agree on that piece. They should not be</p>
<p>the arbiter of that. That is what is triggering but that is what is triggering the conservatives</p>
<p>in particular, but everybody but especially conservatives to say they want to repeal</p>
<p>section 230. Nobody, my point is nobody is safe. And it&rsquo;s less about I actually think that there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a nuanced point to this, which is it&rsquo;s less about what they think is legit or not as much as what</p>
<p>they think is important or not. They chose to make this an important article. They chose to</p>
<p>kind of intervene in this particular case when every day there are going to be hundreds of other</p>
<p>articles that are going to be actively shared on these platforms that are by those same standards,</p>
<p>false with some degree of equivalency, false and shouldn&rsquo;t be on the platform. Absolutely.</p>
<p>And it is the simple choice that they chose an article to exclude, regardless of the reason in</p>
<p>the background, because there are many articles like it that aren&rsquo;t being excluded. And that alone</p>
<p>speaks to the hole in the system as kind of satisfying. Well, it&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s because</p>
<p>they they have too much power and they&rsquo;re unaware of their own biases. They can&rsquo;t see this action</p>
<p>for what it so clearly was. It was a knee jerk reaction on the part of employees at Twitter and</p>
<p>Facebook to to protect the Biden campaign from a story that they didn&rsquo;t like. I mean, because if</p>
<p>they were to apply these standards evenly, they would have blocked the Trump tax returns for the</p>
<p>exact same reason, by the way, just so you know, about to block you so he can keep the Biden</p>
<p>campaign strong and not have your I would say I&rsquo;ve been red pilled. Actually, the last 24 hours have</p>
<p>been red pilling for me. I got to say, David, I agree with you, because like I thought I thought</p>
<p>that both things were crossing the line, like meaning either you publish them both or you</p>
<p>censor them both. And there are very legitimate reasons where you could be on either side.</p>
<p>But to choose one and not do the other, it just again, it creates for me uncertainty. And I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>like uncertainty. And I really don&rsquo;t like the idea that some nameless, faceless person in one of</p>
<p>these organizations is all of a sudden going to decide for me knowledge and information that to</p>
<p>just unacceptable journalistic standard becomes a slippery slope to nowhere, right? Like at that</p>
<p>point, you&rsquo;re like, what is what is not true? What is opinion? What is not opinion? What is</p>
<p>what you know, how do I validate whether this fucking laptop came from this guy, or this guy,</p>
<p>or this guy? It&rsquo;s a slippery, how are you ever going to resolve that across billions of articles</p>
<p>a day? Anders would be the answer. Yeah. And lower standards. Right. And so let&rsquo;s look at</p>
<p>how slippery the slope has become just a week ago. I mean, literally a week ago, Mark Zuckerberg</p>
<p>put out a statement explaining why Facebook was gonna censor, censor Holocaust denial.</p>
<p>Why he went out on a limb, huh, David?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s I think, wow.</p>
<p>My point, my point is, he actually put out a multi paragraph, well reasoned statement,</p>
<p>multi paragraph, three paragraphs about the Holocaust is bad. Wow, congrats.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m trying to, you&rsquo;re not listening to my point. My point is that he took it seriously,</p>
<p>that he was going to censor something. And I think, you know, people can come down,</p>
<p>you could be like a skokie ACLU liberal and oppose it. Or, you know, you could say, look,</p>
<p>common sense dictates that you would you would censor this, but he felt the need to justify it</p>
<p>with, you know, like a long post. And then one week later, we&rsquo;re already down the slippery slope</p>
<p>to the point where, you know, Facebook&rsquo;s justification for censoring this article</p>
<p>was a tweet by Andy Stone. You know, like, that was it. It was a tweet. That was the only</p>
<p>explanation they gave. By the way, one of the reporters pointed out that if you were going to</p>
<p>announce a new policy, you probably wouldn&rsquo;t want it done by a guy who&rsquo;s been a lifelong Democratic</p>
<p>operative. You know, this was just so and so it just shows that once you start down the slope</p>
<p>of censoring things, it becomes so easy to keep doing it more and more. And, and this is why I</p>
<p>think these guys are really in hot water, whatever, whatever, you know, whatever controversy</p>
<p>there was about Section 230 before, and there was already a lot of rumblings in DC, about modifying</p>
<p>this, they have made things 10 times worse. I mean, as someone who&rsquo;s actually a defender of</p>
<p>Section 230, I wish Dorsey and Zuckerberg weren&rsquo;t making these blunders, because I think they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to ruin the open internet for everyone. Super blundered. I&rsquo;ll tell you what was an</p>
<p>even bigger blunder for an equal blunder for me last night. I don&rsquo;t know if you guys had this</p>
<p>experience. But I was trying to figure out what the consensus view on the Biden Hunter Biden story</p>
<p>was. And I went to Rachel Maddow, and the last word and Anderson Cooper, and there was a media</p>
<p>blackout last night. I couldn&rsquo;t find one left leaning or CNN if that is even in the center. I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;re the center anymore than the left. I couldn&rsquo;t find one person talking about</p>
<p>Biden. I was like, let me just see if I tune into Fox News. And Fox News was only discussing the</p>
<p>Biden story. And so this now felt like, wow, not only if you were one of these, you know,</p>
<p>folks on the left, who&rsquo;s in their filter bubble on Twitter and Facebook, they&rsquo;re not going to see</p>
<p>that story. And then if they tuned into Rachel Maddow, or to Anderson Cooper, or you go to the</p>
<p>New York Times, it&rsquo;s not there either. And then drudge didn&rsquo;t have it for a day. You&rsquo;re bringing</p>
<p>up something so important. So think about what you&rsquo;re really talking about, Jason,</p>
<p>there was a first order reaction that was misplaced, and not rooted in anything that</p>
<p>was really scalable or justifiable. Then everybody has to deal with the second and</p>
<p>third order reactions. The left leaning media outlets circle the wagons, the right leaning</p>
<p>media outlets are up in arms, nobody is happy, both look like they&rsquo;re misleading. And then now</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re a person in the middle, for example, what was what was frustrating for me yesterday was</p>
<p>it took me five or six clicks and hunting and pecking to find out what the hell is actually</p>
<p>going on here. Why is everybody going crazy? But that bothered me, you know? And so I just think,</p>
<p>like, again, it used to be very simple to define what a publisher was and what a distributor was</p>
<p>in a world without code, without machine learning, without AI, without all of these things.</p>
<p>I think those lines are bird. We have to rewrite the laws. I think you should be able to choose.</p>
<p>And then I think if you&rsquo;re trying to do both, by the way, the businesses that successfully do both</p>
<p>will have the best market caps. But if you&rsquo;re trying to do both, you have to live and die by</p>
<p>the sword. Yeah. It would be interesting also if I don&rsquo;t know if you guys have done this,</p>
<p>but I switched my Twitter to being reverse chronological, which you can do in the top</p>
<p>right hand corner of the app or on your desktop, because I just like to see the most recent stuff</p>
<p>first. But then sometimes I do miss something that&rsquo;s trending, whatever. But I just prefer</p>
<p>that because I have a smaller follower list now. But to Friedberg, your point, you kind of like</p>
<p>the algorithm telling you what to watch. So a potential solution here might be&hellip;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying I like it rationally, by the way. I&rsquo;m just saying, like, as a human,</p>
<p>humans like it. I like it. Like, I like to be stimulated with titillating information and,</p>
<p>you know, interesting things that, for whatever reason, I&rsquo;m going to, you know&hellip;</p>
<p>Click on again. You like that experience of jumping down the rabbit hole.</p>
<p>My point is, all humans are activated. And the algorithms, the way they&rsquo;re written,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re designed to activate you and keep you engaged. And activation naturally leads to these</p>
<p>dynamic feedback loops where I&rsquo;m going to get the same sort of stuff over and over again that</p>
<p>identifies, activates me because I clicked on it. And therefore, I&rsquo;m going to, you know,</p>
<p>continue to firm up my opinions and my beliefs in that area. But I think showing me stuff that</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe, showing me stuff that&rsquo;s anti&hellip; I mean, because I&rsquo;m a science guy,</p>
<p>showing me stuff that&rsquo;s anti-science, showing me stuff that&rsquo;s bullshit that I consider bullshit,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to read it anymore. So, if I&rsquo;m reading just random blurtings by random people</p>
<p>in reverse chronological order, it is a completely uncompelling platform to me,</p>
<p>and I will stop using it. And that leads back to kind of the, you know, Chamath&rsquo;s point,</p>
<p>which is that the ultimate incentive, the mechanism by which these platforms stay alive</p>
<p>is the capitalist incentive, which is, you know, how do you drive revenue, and therefore,</p>
<p>how do you drive engagement? And that&rsquo;s to give consumers what they want. And that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what consumers want. All right. Let&rsquo;s give Sax his victory lap. He predicted last time that</p>
<p>there was a possibility that Trump would come out of this like Superman and would do a huge</p>
<p>victory lap. And sure enough, he considered putting a Superman outfit on under his suit,</p>
<p>and he did a victory lap literally around the hospital, putting the Secret Service at risk,</p>
<p>I guess, and then did a Mussolini-like salute from everybody from the top of the White House.</p>
<p>I mean, you nailed it, Sax. He came out. It was very Il Duce.</p>
<p>Il Duce. He did Il Duce.</p>
<p>It was very Il Duce. Il Duce?</p>
<p>No, but it was very predictable. The media was making it sound like Trump was on his deathbed,</p>
<p>you know, because the presumption is always that the administration&rsquo;s hiding something.</p>
<p>He must be much sicker than he&rsquo;s letting on. If he says he&rsquo;s not that sick, it must be really bad.</p>
<p>And so for days and days, they were talking about how Trump was, you know, potentially</p>
<p>had this fatal condition, and by the way, he deserved it. You know, it was a moral failing,</p>
<p>he was negligent. And so it&rsquo;s not unlike really what the right was doing, constantly accusing</p>
<p>Biden of senility, you know, and then Biden went into that debate and then blew away expectations.</p>
<p>And so the same thing here, you know, the media set up Trump to kind of</p>
<p>exceed expectations. But I do think, you know, it is noteworthy that Trump was cured so quickly</p>
<p>with the use of these, you know, clonal antibodies that we talked about last time. I think we talked</p>
<p>about it on the show two weeks ago. And it was a combination, I guess, of Regeneron and Remdesivir,</p>
<p>and the guy was out of there in like, a couple of days. So, you know, it&rsquo;s like the media doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>want to admit anything that is potentially helpful to Trump. But you have to say that at this point,</p>
<p>we have very effective treatments for COVID. They may not be completely distributed. Yet.</p>
<p>Trump obviously had access to them that the rest of us don&rsquo;t have. But it feels to me like we are</p>
<p>really winding down on the whole the whole COVID thing. And I ask a question is it has have they</p>
<p>published the blow by blow tick tock of exactly what he got when? No, they haven&rsquo;t, right? I would</p>
<p>love I would love to have that because Americans deserve. Yeah, they know they know what his</p>
<p>dosage was. And they said what day he got it on the Remdesivir. He got several doses. It said what</p>
<p>days he got the antibody treatment. I just want to print that out and keep it as a folded in my</p>
<p>pocket just in case. We know what to take now. We know what to take if we get sick, right? Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, the question is, can we get it? But even independent of that, right? Like,</p>
<p>I think people love anecdote. It&rsquo;s very hard for people to find emotion and find belief in</p>
<p>statistics. And you know, if you look at the statistics on COVID, you know, you go into the</p>
<p>hospital 80% chance you&rsquo;re coming out. And you know, the average stay for someone that goes in</p>
<p>a lot of people go into the ER, and they&rsquo;re getting pushed back out because they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>severe enough. And I think the anecdote is, everyone that gets COVID dies, the statistics</p>
<p>show that that&rsquo;s not true. And, you know, whether or not Trump got exceptional treatment, he</p>
<p>certainly did. It&rsquo;s very hard to sexist point for the storytelling that has kind of been used to</p>
<p>keep people at home and manage kind of and create this this expectation of severity of this crisis,</p>
<p>etc. It&rsquo;s very hard for people to kind of then say, hey, like, you know, he&rsquo;s got a 97% chance</p>
<p>of making it through this, and he&rsquo;ll be at 90% chance to be out of the hospital in three days.</p>
<p>When it happened, it was a shocking moment. And it really hit that narrative upside down,</p>
<p>right? Like it was just like, well, can we show that there was a tweet recently</p>
<p>providing the statistics on what the real infection fatality rate was for COVID?</p>
<p>Yeah, I saw it. It&rsquo;s about half a percent point four. And that&rsquo;s across,</p>
<p>you know, the whole spectrum. But like in anyone under 75 years old, you&rsquo;ve got the number, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right. But it&rsquo;s here, let me pull it up. So on. We tweet, I think Bill Gurley first tweeted</p>
<p>it. And then I retweeted it. IFR was like, point one, if you&rsquo;re young, and it goes all the way up</p>
<p>to like, point four, if you&rsquo;re above 75, it&rsquo;s way less than point one. Yeah, it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s it was,</p>
<p>I thought the IFR was a lot less severe than that IFR is also distorted, you know,</p>
<p>based on the zero prevalence study that was just published, you can take that number that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>published and divided by about three, three to five. Why get to get the true IFR because not</p>
<p>everyone that&rsquo;s had COVID is registering as a positive infection because they had COVID and</p>
<p>got over it. So there was a paper published in in JAMA a few weeks ago, where they took dialysis</p>
<p>patients, and they measured and they get blood from these dialysis patients. And they measured</p>
<p>COVID antibodies in these patients. And they showed that in the Northeast 30% of people 27</p>
<p>point something percent of people have already had COVID. It&rsquo;s an incredible fact. Wow. And in</p>
<p>the West, the number is close in Western states, they&rsquo;ve kind of got it all written up in this</p>
<p>paper, and they did a great job with paper, it&rsquo;s about 3%. But in aggregate across the United</p>
<p>States, it&rsquo;s a, this was a few weeks ago. So nowadays, it&rsquo;s it was a 10.5%, I think, so it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>probably closer to 12% now people have already had COVID. And so then if you assume that number,</p>
<p>right, I mean, that&rsquo;s 30 million people. And now you look at how many people have died,</p>
<p>we haven&rsquo;t gotten the deaths wrong, right? Because everyone that&rsquo;s died from COVID,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve recorded that death. We know that number. It could be a little inflated, right? People who</p>
<p>died with COVID. Be conservative and assume that it&rsquo;s right. Right? I mean, if I look in the United</p>
<p>States, 217,000 cases, but the real cases is 30 million, 30 million. And that&rsquo;s where you that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>where you end up with this, like, you know, adjusted ifr true ifr of one. Yeah, like very,</p>
<p>very point 1% point. Oh, 7%, or point 7%. Sorry.</p>
<p>By the way, my my tweets aren&rsquo;t loading right now. So</p>
<p>I think Trump just took the tick tock decree, and he just crossed out tick tock and put</p>
<p>Twitter and he just shut Twitter down. What was what is the tick tock thing done?</p>
<p>Yeah, who knows? That was like three weeks ago. It doesn&rsquo;t matter anymore.</p>
<p>Was there a second debate? There&rsquo;s tonight, there&rsquo;s going to be two town halls.</p>
<p>Trump refused to do a zoom with or, you know, a zoom debate. I&rsquo;m talking about the power of zoom,</p>
<p>a virtual debate he wouldn&rsquo;t do, ostensibly because he&rsquo;s not good. When he&rsquo;s not interrupting</p>
<p>somebody would be my take on it. So then he went to NBC, which he made 400 million dollars,</p>
<p>I guess, from The Apprentice. And NBC let him take a time slot directly opposite Biden tonight</p>
<p>to do his own town hall. So they didn&rsquo;t even stagger it. Which NBC, which is responsible</p>
<p>for saving Trump, is getting absolutely demolished by their own actors and showrunners on Twitter.</p>
<p>So I think NBC is going to come out swinging tonight in this town hall to try to, you know,</p>
<p>take down Trump as maybe their penance. That&rsquo;s my prediction for it. But how do you watch Biden</p>
<p>if Biden is up against Trump? Like that&rsquo;s like watching paint dry versus watching like,</p>
<p>you know, some maniac running down Market Street with a samurai sword on meth.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be I won&rsquo;t be watching either. I cannot wait for this election to be over. How many</p>
<p>days until November 3rd? We are like 18 and a wake up 18 days. My gosh, maybe 18.</p>
<p>Yeah, let us just get this over with. Yeah, I know we&rsquo;re all sick of it.</p>
<p>I do feel like I mean, it&rsquo;s the polls are now showing that Biden is up by as much as 17.</p>
<p>I mean, things are really continue to break his way. I think, to your point, Jason,</p>
<p>about Trump being more watchable. I think that&rsquo;s sort of Trump&rsquo;s problem is he just can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>help making himself the center of the news cycle every single day. And to the extent the election</p>
<p>is a referendum on Trump, I think he&rsquo;s going to get repudiated if the election were more of a</p>
<p>contest. And people would weigh Biden&rsquo;s, you know, positions as well. I think Trump would have a</p>
<p>better shot because I think he does have some Biden does have some weaknesses. But the whole</p>
<p>reason why Biden&rsquo;s basement strategy has been working so far is because Trump just eats up all</p>
<p>the oxygen and he&rsquo;s making a referendum on him, which I think he&rsquo;ll lose if he keeps doing it</p>
<p>that way. You know what they say, Saks, what got you here will not get you there. What got him into</p>
<p>his office was the ability to take up the entire media channel during the Republican runoff and</p>
<p>just be able to demolish everybody was entertaining. I want to that is exhausting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s now exhausting. I want to change topics. I would like to ask David to explain his tweet</p>
<p>related to prop 13 or 15. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. So, so I saw that that Mark Zuckerberg had contributed</p>
<p>$11 million to try and convince the people of California to vote for this prop 15, which is the</p>
<p>largest property tax increase in California history. What it does is it chips away at prop 13</p>
<p>by moving commercial property out of prop 13. And it would then tax it on what&rsquo;s called fair</p>
<p>market value as opposed to the cost basis of the property. It would have a lot of unfair consequences</p>
<p>for property owners who&rsquo;ve owned their commercial property for a long time.</p>
<p>You know, if you&rsquo;re a small business and you&rsquo;ve owned your store or whatever for 20, 30 years,</p>
<p>all of a sudden you&rsquo;re going to get your taxes are going to get reassessed at the new fair market</p>
<p>value. But I just think there&rsquo;s the larger prize though, is that the California unions,</p>
<p>the government workers unions want to chip away at prop 13. This is the first salvo. First,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to strip out commercial property. Eventually they want to basically repeal all of</p>
<p>prop 13. And I just think it&rsquo;s like so misguided for billionaires to be using their wealth in this</p>
<p>way. Because prop 13 is really the shield of the middle class in California. And it&rsquo;s kind of no</p>
<p>wonder that, frankly, like tech built wealth is so just increasingly despised in this country.</p>
<p>Because tech billionaires are funding such stupid causes.</p>
<p>To explain this to people who don&rsquo;t know in California, if you bought your house in 1970</p>
<p>for $50,000, the 1% tax you pay on it is $500. That house might be worth 5 million today,</p>
<p>if it was an atherogen. And so you&rsquo;re still paying what would have been a $50,000 tax bill</p>
<p>is a $500 tax bill. So they&rsquo;re starting with commercial spaces. And Jason, sorry,</p>
<p>and you can pass it off to your kids at that cost basis. So this is why you have two old</p>
<p>people living in a five bedroom, right? It caps the rate increase of the tax increase every year.</p>
<p>There, there&rsquo;s there. If you didn&rsquo;t have prop 13, not hold on. If you didn&rsquo;t have prop me just</p>
<p>explain to people if you didn&rsquo;t have prop 13. Anybody who owned his own their house for say</p>
<p>20 years would have a massive tax bill all of a sudden, and probably would have to sell their</p>
<p>house. Just about anybody who&rsquo;s middle class, who&rsquo;s been in California for more than a decade</p>
<p>or two, probably could no longer afford to live in their house. But the reality is people are</p>
<p>mortgaging that asset sex to access capital that they&rsquo;re using and investing in different things,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s fueling the economy, right? So I mean, the libertarian point of view might be</p>
<p>less taxes is good, because in this particular case, that building can still be used by that</p>
<p>resident to buy stuff, they can take a mortgage out and they can go spend that money versus having</p>
<p>that money eaten up by property taxes, which just goes well. Yeah, so so so I understand that if you</p>
<p>were to design the like perfect tax policy, it wouldn&rsquo;t look like prop 13 or, you know, or, you</p>
<p>know, maybe prop 15 in a vacuum, if you&rsquo;re just like a policy wonk trying to design the ideal tax</p>
<p>policy, it might look more like that. But the real problem in California, we&rsquo;re not an undertaxed</p>
<p>state, it&rsquo;s a massively taxed state. And, and there&rsquo;s never enough, you know, the beast always</p>
<p>wants more. And so what I would say is, look, if you want to reform prop 13, do it as part of a</p>
<p>grand bargain, that creates real structural reform in the state of California. What I mean by</p>
<p>structural reform, we got to look at, well, who controls the system, and it&rsquo;s really the government</p>
<p>employee unions, who block all structural reform, and who keep eating up a bigger and bigger portion</p>
<p>of the state budget. So we&rsquo;ve talked about this on previous pods that the police unions block any</p>
<p>kind of police reform. You know, the prison unions block prison reform, you&rsquo;ve got the teachers</p>
<p>unions blocking education reform and school choice. If you want to talk about systemic</p>
<p>problems in California, look at who runs the system. It&rsquo;s these these gigantic unions,</p>
<p>and a bigger and bigger portion of the budget keeps going to them every year, they&rsquo;re breaking</p>
<p>the bank. And by the way, it doesn&rsquo;t get us more cops on the beat, it doesn&rsquo;t get us more teachers</p>
<p>in the classroom, what it&rsquo;s buying is lots and lots more of administration, along with a bunch</p>
<p>of pension fraud. And so what I would do is I would say, look, we need some structural reforms</p>
<p>here, we need some caps on the rate of growth in spending, we need some pension reforms. In</p>
<p>exchange for that, as part of a grand bargain, you might get some reforms to prop 13. But just to</p>
<p>give away one of the only cards we have in negotiating with these powerful special interests</p>
<p>for no reason. I just think it&rsquo;s dumb, you know, do you think that Zuck was tricked? Or what do</p>
<p>you think? I think he&rsquo;s probably got, look, I don&rsquo;t really know. But I don&rsquo;t know how many</p>
<p>Zuck and I&rsquo;ve defended him on this podcast a lot, basically on, on the speech issue. But</p>
<p>I think what it is, he&rsquo;s got some foundation, and he&rsquo;s got some pointy headed policy walks sitting</p>
<p>there trying to analyze what the perfect tax policy is. And it probably looks more like fair</p>
<p>market value than like cost basis. And they&rsquo;re not thinking about the larger political sort of</p>
<p>ramifications, which is, we the private sector is being squeezed more and more by these public</p>
<p>employee unions. And we do need structural reform. And we can&rsquo;t just give up one of the</p>
<p>only cards we have, which would be, you know, trading reform on prop 13.</p>
<p>And Zuck doesn&rsquo;t already commercial real estate.</p>
<p>Well, even if so, I would venture to guess that maybe sex does. I don&rsquo;t know. I mean,</p>
<p>hold on, let me I do. But let me explain that this doesn&rsquo;t affect me because my cost basis</p>
<p>is fresh. Yeah, all the all the commercial real estate that I&rsquo;ve bought in California has been</p>
<p>the last few years is probably underwater. I mean, it&rsquo;s certainly not about my cost basis.</p>
<p>So it doesn&rsquo;t affect me, it affects the little guy, it affects the small business who&rsquo;s owned</p>
<p>their property for 10 or 20 years. And again, I&rsquo;m not arguing that we can come with a better</p>
<p>tax system. But what I&rsquo;m saying is the bigger, more pressing need is structural reform.</p>
<p>Totally. No, I mean, I totally agree. The bloated monster of socialism is coming for us. And it</p>
<p>starts with the unions and it evolves. And it&rsquo;s just average salary. I don&rsquo;t know if you saw this</p>
<p>go viral in the last couple weeks on Twitter. Average average salary in San Francisco. $170,000</p>
<p>out of tech workers, city employees, employees. I saw that like 170,000 was the average salary.</p>
<p>I was like, Oh, wow, tech people are doing good. Like, no, no, no, that&rsquo;s the city employees.</p>
<p>19,000 administrative employees in the city of San Francisco city of 800,000 people.</p>
<p>800,000 people with a $14 billion budget.</p>
<p>The state of California is converting the entire middle class into government workers,</p>
<p>because if you&rsquo;re a small business owner, you&rsquo;re getting squeezed by more and more taxes.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re getting driven out of the state. People leaving the state now exceeds people</p>
<p>immigrating into the state. So the private sector middle class is leaving and this public</p>
<p>sector middle class of government workers is being created. And like I mentioned,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not getting us more cops on the beat. It&rsquo;s not getting us more teachers in the classroom.</p>
<p>What it&rsquo;s getting is a giant number of overpaid administrators and bureaucrats.</p>
<p>That is a big structural problem. The private sector unions are very different. You see,</p>
<p>when a private sector union goes to negotiate, they go negotiate against ownership or management,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s someone to oppose their unreasonable demands, not all the demands are reasonable,</p>
<p>just the most unreasonable demands. But with the public sector unions are negotiating against the</p>
<p>politicians. And they are the largest contributors to those politicians. And so there&rsquo;s no one</p>
<p>and the politicians need them for their votes, right? They&rsquo;re like, they&rsquo;re going to deliver</p>
<p>whatever number of teachers, police officers. Exactly. The unions feed the politicians,</p>
<p>the politicians feed the unions, that is a structural. That is a structural problem.</p>
<p>And these unions will, the unions will never be a piece, you can never buy them off.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s why democracy always ends in the state. Like it&rsquo;s just an inevitable outcome.</p>
<p>I am. I had no idea about any of this until I&rsquo;m glad I asked you about that tweet. That&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>I actually learned a lot just in that last little bit. I have one other thing I want to ask you guys</p>
<p>about, which is the Amy Coney Barrett confirmation hearings, whether you guys have watched them,</p>
<p>and what you guys think. And I don&rsquo;t know whether these are just cherry picked clips, or</p>
<p>whether she&rsquo;s playing dumb, or I really don&rsquo;t want to judge because I want to know more. But</p>
<p>I just want to know what you guys think up going into this. You know, I&rsquo;ll say something about</p>
<p>climate change, because, look, I spend a lot of time looking at data and research on climate</p>
<p>change, and certainly feel strongly that there&rsquo;s a human caused function of global warming that</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re actively kind of experiencing. But I think everyone kind of assumes you have to take that as</p>
<p>truth. I think one of the key points of science is you have to recognize your ignorance, and you</p>
<p>have to recognize that science is, you know, kind of an evolving process of discovery and</p>
<p>understanding. I don&rsquo;t, and she&rsquo;s getting a lot of heat for what she said about, I&rsquo;m not a scientist,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how to opine on climate change. And I heard that and actually gave me a bit of pause</p>
<p>that like, this, this is exactly, you know, what I would expect someone who&rsquo;s thoughtful to say,</p>
<p>not someone that&rsquo;s trying to act ignorant and play to the right. She didn&rsquo;t say I don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>climate change is being caused by humans. And I think like, everyone kind of wants to jump on her</p>
<p>and every, it&rsquo;s like become religion. I just want to point out that climate change has become as</p>
<p>politicized and as dogmatic as all these other topics we talked about. And we all kind of assume</p>
<p>that if you do or don&rsquo;t believe in climate change, you&rsquo;re left or right, you&rsquo;re evil, you&rsquo;re good.</p>
<p>And I think like, it&rsquo;s very easy to kind of just go into those hearings and assume that.</p>
<p>But I wouldn&rsquo;t say that her answer necessarily made me think that she is ignoring facts and</p>
<p>ignoring the truth. I think, you know, she&rsquo;s kind of pointing out that this is a process of</p>
<p>science. And there&rsquo;s a lot of discovery underway. So I don&rsquo;t know, I mean, that was one point that</p>
<p>controversial point that I thought I should make. Because I am a believer, I do think that climate</p>
<p>change is real. I do think the data and science supports it. But I do appreciate that someone</p>
<p>recognizes that they may not have the skill, the few rather than just assume what the media tells</p>
<p>them to believe. Yeah, the few the few clips that I saw the confirmation hearing, my takeaway was</p>
<p>basically, you know, any candidate on the left or the right comes in extremely well coached.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re taught basically how to evade meaning there&rsquo;s a go to answer Amy Coney Barrett&rsquo;s go to</p>
<p>answer was, listen, as a judge, I&rsquo;d have to, you know, hear that case on the record, I can&rsquo;t opine</p>
<p>on something hypothetically, you know, she had this very well rehearsed answer. And a lot of</p>
<p>the answers to the questions from the left were that. And, you know, the questions on the right</p>
<p>were more softball ish. So I couldn&rsquo;t really get a sense of it. Now, the thing that I take</p>
<p>kind of a lot of comfort in is that, you know, when we saw john roberts get confirmed to the court,</p>
<p>it was supposed to be five for conservative with john roberts. And basically, what we learned was</p>
<p>now john robertson, you know, some critical decisions, he is willing to basically, you know,</p>
<p>make sure that things don&rsquo;t change that much. Including Obamacare. Yeah, exactly. You know,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t know exactly how they&rsquo;re going to vote on these issues. You really don&rsquo;t Roberts was the</p>
<p>deciding vote and upholding Obamacare. Gorsuch extended gay rights well beyond anything Anthony</p>
<p>Kennedy ever did. That was a big surprise. And so we don&rsquo;t really know exactly how she&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>vote. The reason why Amy Coney Barrett rockets to the top of Trump&rsquo;s list, quite frankly,</p>
<p>is because of how Dianne Feinstein treated her three years ago in the last confirmation hearings,</p>
<p>which she is she where Feinstein attacked her Catholicism. It was it was so ham handed,</p>
<p>it was so poorly done that it made Barrett a hero instantly on the right and it rocketed her to the</p>
<p>top of this list. But we don&rsquo;t know how she&rsquo;s gonna vote based on her Catholicism, you know,</p>
<p>which is a feature, isn&rsquo;t it, David, because the lifetime appointment means they like tenure,</p>
<p>they can go with what they think is right. So that is kind of a good feature of the Supreme</p>
<p>Court. Do you think there should be like a term? Well, I think it&rsquo;s a little crazy that decisions</p>
<p>as important as you know, the right to choice or something like that hangs on whether an 89 year</p>
<p>old cancer victim can hold on for three more months, you know, it seems very arbitrary to</p>
<p>me. And therefore, these Supreme Court battles become very heated and toxic. And there&rsquo;s been a</p>
<p>recent proposal by Democrats that I would support, which basically says, listen, we should have an</p>
<p>18 year term for Supreme Court justice, that&rsquo;s long enough. And each president should get two</p>
<p>nominees, like one in the first year, and then one in the third year. And so you basically have</p>
<p>one justice rolling off every two years, and one coming on. And so you have nine justices. And so</p>
<p>every two years, as up to 18 years, that proposal makes a ton of sense to me. And, and so you know,</p>
<p>you know, that when you vote for a president, they&rsquo;re going to get to Supreme Court picks,</p>
<p>that feels less chaotic than this, that would be, that&rsquo;d be a much better.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a great idea. That&rsquo;s a great idea. Yeah, that&rsquo;s a great idea. I think it&rsquo;s a fabulous</p>
<p>idea. I took solace in the fact that when they asked her the what&rsquo;s protected in the First</p>
<p>Amendment, she couldn&rsquo;t name all five things that I could. I was like, what about protest? Did you</p>
<p>miss that? What? And I thought that was like, I mean, it&rsquo;s a gotcha moment, obviously. And it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not easy to be under that kind of scrutiny. And obviously, she just as Jayco. Well, I just thought</p>
<p>that was like, it&rsquo;s also like, pretty interesting. I think they I think they I think they</p>
<p>I think they invented the word unconfirmable for Jayco.</p>
<p>You got a right to have your own pistola, but you shouldn&rsquo;t have a shotgun.</p>
<p>Boys, free free burgers has a hard stop at three.</p>
<p>The the the fact that you left out protesters, I do think let&rsquo;s let&rsquo;s just end on the election</p>
<p>and our little handicapping of what&rsquo;s going to happen and getting out of this mess. I do think</p>
<p>one of the stories coming out of this is going to be female voters. I have the sense,</p>
<p>and I know it&rsquo;s anecdotal, that Trump has just alienated and pissed off so many women,</p>
<p>and that the threat of the Supreme Court thing and with RGB dying, this has made women feel so</p>
<p>underappreciated and attacked, especially with Trump,</p>
<p>you know, in terms of how he treats women and things he says about women.</p>
<p>And then you had the constant interruption by Pence of the moderator and Kamala. I think all</p>
<p>of this is going to add up and we do the postmortem on this. Losing all these women as</p>
<p>voters is going to be and as well as the black vote and people of color. This is going to be</p>
<p>a big part of it. So I think that Trump&rsquo;s going to lose and it&rsquo;s going to be a landslide.</p>
<p>What a roundabout way to say the same thing you&rsquo;ve been saying for four months.</p>
<p>Oh, my God. Disrespected women. I don&rsquo;t know. Listen, I don&rsquo;t know. I think Biden is on the</p>
<p>path to an enormous victory. Well, that&rsquo;s what the polls that&rsquo;s what the polls say,</p>
<p>certainly, is that it looks like a buy in landslide. I and I guess that makes sense.</p>
<p>I think Trump&rsquo;s running out of time to change the polls every day that goes by. He&rsquo;s basically got</p>
<p>like 19 outs or 18 days. He&rsquo;s got 18 outs every day that goes by where he isn&rsquo;t able to move the</p>
<p>poll number. He loses an out. Right. And so we&rsquo;re going to get closer to Election Day. He&rsquo;s only</p>
<p>going to have like a three out or something. So, yeah, I mean, look, obviously, I understand the</p>
<p>polls. I still somehow think I know it sounds kind of weird, but I&rsquo;m just not sure Americans</p>
<p>are ready for this reality show to end. I mean, we know it&rsquo;s jumped the shark. OK,</p>
<p>but the Kardashians, the Kardashians lasted for 19 seasons. I just don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>if America is ready for the Trump reality show. I think part of the appeal of Trump</p>
<p>last time around was the the message of change. And he&rsquo;s not delivering a message of change</p>
<p>anymore. And I think that&rsquo;s where he&rsquo;s kind of lost the narrative and the excitement of building</p>
<p>a wall and changing everything and draining the swamp like he&rsquo;s just like keep draining the swamp</p>
<p>or keep building the wall. And people don&rsquo;t love that. He&rsquo;s also he also I think is coming across</p>
<p>as not being he&rsquo;s looking weak by not being willing to be challenged. And that came across</p>
<p>clearly in that debate last time around. He got on stage and he just knocked everyone down.</p>
<p>But by not letting Biden talk, by not kind of engaging on any of the topics, he looks just</p>
<p>he looks like he just doesn&rsquo;t want to have a shot at it. And it just comes across as bad.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know. These are all contributing factors, I think, to what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>Chances of a pardon by Pence. He resigns. He pardons himself.</p>
<p>Pence pardons him. Zero. Zero. Zero. Ego tax. He won&rsquo;t resign.</p>
<p>Well, we wouldn&rsquo;t see that unless he lost the election.</p>
<p>If he loses. During the lame duck. During the lame duck period.</p>
<p>If he lost maybe 20 percent. 20 percent. Yeah.</p>
<p>Because at that point, he&rsquo;s got nothing to lose. Right.</p>
<p>Right. That I think it&rsquo;s I think it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s 50 50. He just goes for the full family pardon.</p>
<p>All right. All right. Love you guys. I got to go.</p>
<p>All right, guys. Love you guys. And hopefully we&rsquo;ll have a bestie poker soon.</p>
<p>Yeah. Talk to you guys later. Bye.</p>
