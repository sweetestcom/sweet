    <p>All right, everybody, welcome to the all in podcast. And with me</p>
<p>again, this week, the Sultan of science, the Prince of panic</p>
<p>attacks, the Queen of quinoa, David Friedberg, the dictator</p>
<p>Chamath Palihapitiya wearing a beautiful Mr. B sweater, and</p>
<p>David Sachs, the rain man himself. Thanks for coming to my</p>
<p>Laura Piana dinner on Tuesday, Jacob. That was wonderful.</p>
<p>Thanks. At least one bestie showed up for you. Wonderful,</p>
<p>wonderful dinner. I sat as far away from the Laura Piana people</p>
<p>as possible in the arranged seating. Thank you for that. I</p>
<p>guess maybe you were like, I&rsquo;m going to contain the damage.</p>
<p>Bernard Arnault said, put put the all caps got the end and I</p>
<p>said, Okay, yeah, he still heard me. I was like, what&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>amuse bouge? joke at dinner every time he said something he</p>
<p>yelled like he was in</p>
<p>I want another butterscotch pudding.</p>
<p>The butterscotch pudding is delightful. Sean&rsquo;s like, I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>four feet away from me. Jake out. You can take the cap slot.</p>
<p>Sean was so embarrassed. Chef Sean crushed it. Chef Sean</p>
<p>crushed it. Sean crushed it once again. Were you sounding</p>
<p>alarms when the restaurant like almost ran out of something?</p>
<p>Alert, alert, alert. Restaurant is running low on coffee. We&rsquo;re</p>
<p>dangerously low on caviar on this one.</p>
<p>Let your winners ride.</p>
<p>Rain Man, David Satterthwaite.</p>
<p>All right, everybody, welcome to the pod where we, you know, try</p>
<p>to inform you. We try to make some jokes here. I just want to</p>
<p>make what is a little bit of an opening statement here. It&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>an apology. And it&rsquo;s not a victory lap in any way. But</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s been a lot of attention, I think, on the last episode of</p>
<p>the pod, and perhaps some tweeting from two of the four</p>
<p>besties this past weekend. I saw and I you know, I&rsquo;ll let you</p>
<p>speak for yourself, your sacks, and we&rsquo;re going to get into the</p>
<p>timeline of what&rsquo;s occurred. And then what are potential outcomes</p>
<p>here and solutions to the banking issues that we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>witnessed in what is a week since the bank run on Silicon</p>
<p>Valley Bank and the shutdown on Friday. But what I saw, and</p>
<p>again, speaking only for myself here was absolutely terrifying</p>
<p>up close and personally, watching people pulling money</p>
<p>out of banks and watching people have to set up loans to hit</p>
<p>their payroll. And this was like one of those surreal moments in</p>
<p>a in a movie where like a meteor is coming towards Earth, and you</p>
<p>see it in the telescope, and nobody else sees it or only a</p>
<p>small number of people in the observatory see it. And I think</p>
<p>part of the reason people listen to this podcast is</p>
<p>because we are insiders. And speaking again, just for myself,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m always trying to be exceptionally candid and</p>
<p>transparent with the audience. Additionally, I make jokes. So</p>
<p>sometimes you might laugh during this podcast, or you might laugh</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re reading my tweets. And that&rsquo;s part of what I do.</p>
<p>Now, I also realized that we have an audience now, that is</p>
<p>larger than I think any of us expected for this podcast, I</p>
<p>certainly magnitude larger than I expected. And frankly, I</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t know if this podcast was going to make it past 50 or 100</p>
<p>episodes. And my Twitter following count doubled since we</p>
<p>started this podcast. And</p>
<p>you tried to ruin the pot.</p>
<p>I think it was because of the caps locks. But anyway, putting</p>
<p>all that aside, what I would like to say as well is like, we</p>
<p>are living in a situation that is unprecedented. I think the</p>
<p>alarm bell I sounded, you know, was because I saw a fire. We&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>get into the timeline here. But I sounded that alarm bell after</p>
<p>Silicon Valley Bank was put into receivership. And when I</p>
<p>saw additional bank runs occurring, I wouldn&rsquo;t change it.</p>
<p>I think these were the right the right thing to do was to inform</p>
<p>folks. Now I did use all caps, perhaps a little too much. That</p>
<p>was a little bit of a bit if people didn&rsquo;t understand that</p>
<p>maybe I need to adjust my communication style now that</p>
<p>this thing is so popular. But I stand by my mode of operating in</p>
<p>the world, which is I always want to be candid with people. I</p>
<p>always want to tell the truth. And yeah, sometimes I make jokes</p>
<p>about life and, you know, dealing with the stressful</p>
<p>situations. That&rsquo;s it. It&rsquo;s not an apology. It&rsquo;s more of an</p>
<p>explainer. And yeah, maybe I need to adjust the caps lock or</p>
<p>how I deliver stuff. But I stand by the message of what I said.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s important for us to maybe look at the series</p>
<p>of events and misinformation that has spread because there</p>
<p>are people literally blaming venture capitalists for the bank</p>
<p>run that is now systematic. And the balance sheets of multiple</p>
<p>banks around the world. And I think sex would be great for you</p>
<p>to maybe just comment on the week that was and the timeline</p>
<p>of events. Yeah. So as usual, you&rsquo;re not apologizing. No,</p>
<p>absolutely not apologizing. But we&rsquo;ll recognize that this</p>
<p>platform is bigger. And that may be on the margins, I could</p>
<p>adjust my communication strategy. But Chris, there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>lot of people who don&rsquo;t know that I make jokes. And maybe</p>
<p>people don&rsquo;t understand what I&rsquo;m joking and when I&rsquo;m serious,</p>
<p>right. And so Jason, what would you change?</p>
<p>Was there anything you change?</p>
<p>I think I might not have used a Mad Max image and gift about the</p>
<p>end of the world. Because people are too stupid to understand</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a joke and a fictional movie. I see. So you find</p>
<p>yelling effective. It depends. Well,</p>
<p>Jay Cal, I agree that I don&rsquo;t think you have anything to</p>
<p>apologize for in terms of the substance of what you&rsquo;re trying</p>
<p>to get across. I personally could have done without the all</p>
<p>caps. It was a bit. Yeah, what you&rsquo;re basically saying is</p>
<p>nobody should listen to you because you&rsquo;re not that</p>
<p>important. And I wholeheartedly agree with that.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m saying understand, I might make a joke. Consider me</p>
<p>more, of course, more category. Yeah. All right, let&rsquo;s go back.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go back and look at the timeline. Because there are now</p>
<p>serious accusations. And I would call it really scapegoating of</p>
<p>and it wasn&rsquo;t just you, it was me and Bill Ackman. In fact, the</p>
<p>Wall Street Journal editorial board, which I respect a lot,</p>
<p>mischaracterized what me and Ackman were trying to do in</p>
<p>terms of drawing attention to a regional banking crisis in</p>
<p>progress, a run on the banks, they called it spreading panic,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how you tweet or publicly discuss a run on the</p>
<p>bank that&rsquo;s currently happening needs to be addressed with an</p>
<p>immediate federal intervention. I don&rsquo;t know how you can discuss</p>
<p>it without then having someone else mischaracterize it as</p>
<p>trying to spread a panic. But Jake, how the Wall Street</p>
<p>Journal editorial board didn&rsquo;t mention you. So you&rsquo;re off the</p>
<p>hook. They didn&rsquo;t know who you are. Thank you. But no, but</p>
<p>seriously, so I went back and looked at the timeline of all of</p>
<p>this. And so first of all, we have to understand that this</p>
<p>banking crisis now has swept in five banks, five bank failures.</p>
<p>First, there was Silvergate, but everyone dismissed that because</p>
<p>it was some weird crypto bank. Then it was SVB. But everyone</p>
<p>sort of dismissed it because they said it was based on</p>
<p>panicky VCs rather than a systemic problem in the banking</p>
<p>system. Then it was Signature Bank, which got seized on</p>
<p>Sunday, which I think utterly refuted the idea that this was</p>
<p>just a Silicon Valley problem. Then you had the Fed step in and</p>
<p>backstop First Republic, which would have been the next</p>
<p>domino to fall if it wasn&rsquo;t backstopped. And then five, you</p>
<p>had Credit Suisse, basically, again, avoid an outright failure</p>
<p>because they got backstopped by the Swiss government. So we now</p>
<p>have five banks in roughly a week. And these are not small</p>
<p>banks. Credit Suisse is a GSIB, a globally systemically</p>
<p>important bank. And the other ones are top 20, top 30 type</p>
<p>banks, we&rsquo;re talking about hundreds of billions of dollars</p>
<p>in deposits. So clearly, there&rsquo;s a larger phenomenon going on</p>
<p>here. And frankly, it&rsquo;s being caused not by like anything VCs</p>
<p>did, because VCs are just depositors. We&rsquo;re just one class</p>
<p>of depositors. And depositors are not to blame for what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on here. What&rsquo;s going on is that these banks have huge</p>
<p>unrealized losses on their balance sheet. And the losses</p>
<p>have come from the sun spike in interest rates. That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on. The sun spike in interest rates is because we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>had the most rapid Fed tightening cycle in our</p>
<p>lifetimes. In the last year, the Fed funds rates gone from</p>
<p>roughly zero to almost 5%. That has broken a lot of things. And</p>
<p>the banks which have broken first are the ones that had</p>
<p>pre existing problems. And they had horrible risk management.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s who gets broken first in a stress test, right is the</p>
<p>most poorly run banks, the ones with pre existing issues. But</p>
<p>just because they went first doesn&rsquo;t mean that others don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have similar kinds of issues. Now, I&rsquo;m not saying this in any</p>
<p>way to be panicky, where those banks will be fine. But there</p>
<p>are larger issues in the banking system that are worth talking</p>
<p>about. And to the point about whether VCs could have spread</p>
<p>this, Jake, how you&rsquo;re absolutely right about the</p>
<p>timeline. I mean, I went back and checked. I personally never</p>
<p>tweeted anything about SVB until Friday afternoon, when SVB was</p>
<p>already in receivership. And the run on the bank had already</p>
<p>started with signature and First Republic, and we could see it</p>
<p>with our own eyes. And then this pod didn&rsquo;t drop the one where we</p>
<p>talked about this problem didn&rsquo;t drop until Saturday morning when</p>
<p>the banks were already closed. And by Sunday night, the Fed had</p>
<p>acted and basically implemented our recommendations, which was</p>
<p>to basically intervene. So I don&rsquo;t know how you can blame the</p>
<p>search for scapegoats, I think is getting out of control. And</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just not factually accurate.</p>
<p>And you know that it&rsquo;s convenient to make tech, which</p>
<p>is hated right now, Chamath and Friedberg, you know, the</p>
<p>scapegoat venture capital is obviously the part of tech that</p>
<p>people might hate the most or the easiest target. But let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>talk about the Fed raised those rates because of inflation and</p>
<p>inflation happened because of out of control spending due to</p>
<p>COVID. And then the second administration, so you had a</p>
<p>republican administration that spent a lot of money and then a</p>
<p>democratic administration, Chamath that spent a lot of</p>
<p>money. So maybe we could even go backwards from Fed fund rate,</p>
<p>going, you know, what looks like parabolic when you look at the</p>
<p>chart. Maybe you could speak to what got us to the Fed making</p>
<p>those decisions Chamath or Friedberg,</p>
<p>maybe I can just do a little cleanup on what SAC said. I</p>
<p>think your issues at Credit Suisse are different than the</p>
<p>issues at First Republic. And the issues at First Republic are</p>
<p>different than those other three banks. The other three banks,</p>
<p>David, that you mentioned, Signature, Silicon Valley Bank,</p>
<p>and Silvergate, all had very traditional liquidity crises,</p>
<p>right? We talked about this last week, which is duration</p>
<p>mismatching, where you have depositors who want their money</p>
<p>today, but you have assets that mature in 10 years. And as a</p>
<p>result, you have huge unrealized losses if you all of a sudden</p>
<p>cash them out today versus waiting 10 years. I think what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>happening at First Republic is really just about making sure</p>
<p>that that loan book and the depositors can get parked into a</p>
<p>combination set of banks that can take care of the balance</p>
<p>sheet so that there are no more liquidity issues. At Credit</p>
<p>Suisse, they have an enormous amount of liquidity. What that</p>
<p>was, was I think a lot of speculation around whether they</p>
<p>would default on their bonds or whether they would theoretically</p>
<p>need more liquidity. But the balance sheet itself was not</p>
<p>only liquid, but also very solvent. So I think that was</p>
<p>just more of a panicky reaction to comments from a 9.9%</p>
<p>shareholder who just said that they can&rsquo;t put in any more</p>
<p>equity. But even then, I went back, this is the chairman of</p>
<p>the Saudi National Bank. He was asked on Bloomberg, would you</p>
<p>give Credit Suisse more money? And he had a very reasonable</p>
<p>answer. But it was snapshotted in a very awkward way. The first</p>
<p>sentence was under no circumstances, would he do that?</p>
<p>Okay. Now, if you stop there, you could be panicked. But the</p>
<p>rest of it made a lot of sense, which is he said, Look, in Saudi</p>
<p>Arabia, if we go above 10%, we have to go through regulatory</p>
<p>approvals domestically, and there are regulatory approvals</p>
<p>abroad. That&rsquo;s a big hill to climb. And all of a sudden, it</p>
<p>no longer becomes a financial investment, it becomes a</p>
<p>somewhat political investment. And so we&rsquo;re very happy at 9.9%.</p>
<p>That was the totality of his statement. But if you just</p>
<p>cherry pick the first 45 seconds and ran with it, which people on</p>
<p>the internet did, this is sort of what caused that second level</p>
<p>wave panic at a GSIB. And then the Swiss National Bank stepped</p>
<p>in. And I think that that panic has largely gone. Okay, so what</p>
<p>is the real issue? The issue again, is I think we have had a</p>
<p>bit of supervisory failure here. Right? Because we all know this</p>
<p>in any industry. If you let capitalism go totally unchecked,</p>
<p>shareholders will demand immediate profits today. It</p>
<p>happens in every industry, except in ones where you can</p>
<p>basically gamble on future profits. And that&rsquo;s what tech</p>
<p>does. But every other shareholder in every other asset</p>
<p>class demands money today. And that&rsquo;s the same for banks. The</p>
<p>problem is the banks are a highly regulated business. They</p>
<p>are supposed to be supervised by the regulators. And this is a</p>
<p>very clear example where why is there not a real time</p>
<p>spreadsheet? I mean, this is not complicated stuff, where assets</p>
<p>and liabilities and duration mismatching can be known on a</p>
<p>real time basis where the San Francisco Fed, Mary Daly should</p>
<p>have a report that&rsquo;s escalated to her when SVB got over their</p>
<p>ski tips, which they did in q4 of 2022. So I think the real</p>
<p>question that has to be examined is where were these folks for</p>
<p>the last four months when they could have done something, not</p>
<p>just about this, but rules in general for all banks that are</p>
<p>not the GSIBs. And I think that&rsquo;s a very important question</p>
<p>that politicians need to get to the root of Friedberg, we</p>
<p>discussed this article from seeking alpha, which came out on</p>
<p>let me get the exact date here, December 19. Title of this</p>
<p>seeking alpha story is SVB financial colon blow up risk. And</p>
<p>the summary in three bullet points, says, bullet point one,</p>
<p>potential losses in loan portfolios could severely</p>
<p>impair book equity number two, unreal is unrealized losses in</p>
<p>hold to maturity portfolio already equal to book equity.</p>
<p>Number three, funding environment for startups were</p>
<p>pressure deposit base, adding even more pressure to the</p>
<p>balance sheet. In other words, startups spending money to cover</p>
<p>their burn rate, Friedberg. And obviously, we had the Dodd Frank</p>
<p>rules lessened or loosened under the previous administration. And</p>
<p>that specifically was driven by Silicon Valley Bank that had a</p>
<p>big part in that. So looking back on this, and people do want</p>
<p>to place blame, let&rsquo;s talk about the effects that occurred,</p>
<p>because this was hiding in plain sight. Literally, in December in</p>
<p>an article that looks like it was written by somebody who went</p>
<p>into a time machine and said, How do I warn people in December</p>
<p>about this? Maybe you could talk about the Fed&rsquo;s interest rates,</p>
<p>the spending and what led up to this look issue with the banks.</p>
<p>You guys remember when we started this podcast, three</p>
<p>years ago, we were like, they&rsquo;re gonna shut down the economy.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s gonna be crazy second and third order effects of doing</p>
<p>that no one knows what they&rsquo;re going to be. Here they are. And</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s like the root of what is a rippling effect, you</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t shut down the global economy, and stop trade and stop</p>
<p>people and have the government step in to write a giant check</p>
<p>and not expect that you&rsquo;re going to have to cash that check at</p>
<p>some point. That&rsquo;s effectively what I think we&rsquo;ve been kicking</p>
<p>down the road here. The way we initially tried to resolve the</p>
<p>problem was to drop rates to zero, and then spend our way,</p>
<p>you know, back to a growing supported economy, and then</p>
<p>overshot ended up with, you know, too much stimulation, too</p>
<p>much stimulus, to lower rates for too long, responded too</p>
<p>quickly whiplash back. At the end of the day, there was a</p>
<p>giant gaping hole blown into the global economy. When we shut</p>
<p>down the world from COVID. There&rsquo;s no blame, just what</p>
<p>happened. And when that happened, there was a massive</p>
<p>cost that had to be born at some point. And it&rsquo;s going to get</p>
<p>born at some point and the rippling in a pond, you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know where the ripple is going to hit what part of the pond</p>
<p>what leaves it&rsquo;s going to hit. That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s going on still.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s such a dynamical system. It&rsquo;s so hard to say with</p>
<p>linear certainty, this is what should be done and what could</p>
<p>have been done and what they should have done at the time. No</p>
<p>one had that predictive capacity back then. They did what they</p>
<p>needed to do. People thought that they should have dropped</p>
<p>rates. They said we should have written all these big stimulus</p>
<p>checks. Some people said you shouldn&rsquo;t. Some people said you</p>
<p>did. Certainly. Some people are being proven right. And some</p>
<p>people are being proven wrong. But at the end of the day, the</p>
<p>economic loss that was realized at that period of time, we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>still trying to get out of it. And we&rsquo;re still recovering from</p>
<p>it. And I think that&rsquo;s a big part of what&rsquo;s being eaten up</p>
<p>right now. And you&rsquo;re going to see it in the wipe out of</p>
<p>certain equity, you&rsquo;re going to see it in the wipe out of these</p>
<p>banks of the assets that they hold and these portfolios. And</p>
<p>the effects of that are obviously, you know, still being</p>
<p>felt.</p>
<p>Sacks, do you agree that mistakes that this there isn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>somebody to blame, because it is clear that the Fed said,</p>
<p>inflation is transitory, that was wrong. And then they went</p>
<p>faster than in history to raise the rates. Those seem like two</p>
<p>glaring mistakes. And then the Todd the Dodd Frank loosening</p>
<p>under Trump and with Silicon Valley Bank pushing them. That</p>
<p>seemed like a really big mistake.</p>
<p>By the way, I wasn&rsquo;t saying the feds not to blame for not</p>
<p>raising rates faster. That was because you guys remember, I was</p>
<p>the first person to talk about what Stan Druckenmiller had said</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re not raising rates fast enough that we&rsquo;ve got</p>
<p>massive inflation, we should have been raising rates. I was</p>
<p>the first person on the show to be, you know, barking that. So</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t don&rsquo;t forget, like, I was there, like, pretty early, what</p>
<p>I was pointing out was like, we shut down the economy during</p>
<p>COVID. The global economy. Yeah, I got you. So that is the</p>
<p>main cause that is the cannonball that got blown</p>
<p>through the ship. Got it. And everything else is plumbing and</p>
<p>patching and work to try and keep the ship afloat. And we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>still dealing with that. And at the same time, as you guys know,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve been loading the ship up with debt, the global ship, the</p>
<p>global economy with debt, 360% global debt to global GDP ratio</p>
<p>right now. And as that ship has gotten heavier and heavier to</p>
<p>have a giant hole blown in the side while you&rsquo;re trying to do</p>
<p>all this patchwork with all this debt weighing on it. It&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>critical challenge. And the ship is sinking feeling acutely</p>
<p>here. They&rsquo;re feeling it in Europe now. And we&rsquo;re certainly</p>
<p>going to see the global ramifications as we try and fix</p>
<p>this economic catastrophe that was caused by COVID at the same</p>
<p>time that we&rsquo;ve been spending our way into a happier future</p>
<p>that it turns out we have to pay the bills for at some point.</p>
<p>sacks your response.</p>
<p>The question of who you blame for this banking crisis has</p>
<p>really become a political Rorschach test. And I&rsquo;ve seen</p>
<p>that there are six different parties that people want to</p>
<p>blame in this situation. And there&rsquo;s some merit to all of</p>
<p>them. But the degrees are very different. So number one, let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>go to the bank. Okay, number one, the bank management of all</p>
<p>these different banks, clearly, very poor risk management</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t do a good job. They are to blame. However, and</p>
<p>Chamath is right about these banks, they differ in the</p>
<p>details. But the point is that they&rsquo;re all operating under</p>
<p>conditions of extreme stress. Where did that come from? Number</p>
<p>two, the feds rapid rate tightening cycle, clearly, I</p>
<p>think that the combination of poor risk management, with a</p>
<p>spike in interest rates that basically has precipitated this</p>
<p>larger problem. Number three, is I think the Biden</p>
<p>administration spending which in fairness started with COVID</p>
<p>before Biden, but Biden really intensified it. And then I</p>
<p>think it really compound the problem in the summer of 2021.</p>
<p>By claiming that inflation was transitory when it wasn&rsquo;t, that</p>
<p>allowed them to keep spending and keep printing money and kept</p>
<p>QE going for another six months that created the bubble of</p>
<ol start="2021">
<li>Everything got super frothy. And then that made the</li>
</ol>
<p>rate cycle even more vicious, because you started six months</p>
<p>later, they could have started six months earlier, and it</p>
<p>could have been more gradual. And I think that really was a</p>
<p>disaster for the economy. Okay, number four, the D reg in 2018.</p>
<p>I think Elizabeth Warren, and Ro Khanna have made what I would</p>
<p>call a compelling case, that the D reg in 2018 have</p>
<p>contributed to this problem. I think, in hindsight, creating a</p>
<p>two tier system of banks, where one tier are the systemically</p>
<p>important banks who are completely guaranteed and</p>
<p>backstopped by the federal government. And then a sort of</p>
<p>lower tier, a second tier of regional banks was a poison</p>
<p>chalice for the regional banking system. Because in the short</p>
<p>term, it meant they were more lightly regulated, which may be</p>
<p>appropriate for, you know, smaller banks that aren&rsquo;t these</p>
<p>mega banks. However, it has also now, I think, created a</p>
<p>situation where people are less confident about them. And so the</p>
<p>money flows are going from the regional banks to the</p>
<p>systemically important banks, the SIBs. So like I said, it</p>
<p>might be a double edged sword. And I think we&rsquo;re gonna have to</p>
<p>look at those regulations and figure out what&rsquo;s the right</p>
<p>regulatory regime to create confidence in the regional</p>
<p>banking system. We want a thriving regional banking</p>
<p>system. And so the question is, what&rsquo;s the right regulations</p>
<p>that get us there? And then the final two that we can talk about</p>
<p>later are I&rsquo;m hearing wokeness getting blamed, which, listen, I</p>
<p>think that wokeness was a distraction. There were a lot of</p>
<p>crazy programs happening at these banks. But listen, if</p>
<p>wokeness was the key factor, the whole Fortune 500 would be out</p>
<p>of business. Because they all do this stuff. They all do this</p>
<p>stuff. So I think we&rsquo;re going back to the well a little too</p>
<p>often on that critique. And I don&rsquo;t want to burn that critique</p>
<p>out. Because I think that wokeness is bad. But it&rsquo;s not the</p>
<p>key reason why this stuff happened. And then the last</p>
<p>group that gets</p>
<p>wokeness, we could also maybe frame it as ESG more broadly as</p>
<p>the distraction because wokeness is charged ESG is real.</p>
<p>Yeah, what I would say for sure is that if these banks have</p>
<p>spent as much time on risk management as they did on ESG</p>
<p>or on woke, then this crisis wouldn&rsquo;t happen. So definitely</p>
<p>a distraction, but not not the thing that like specifically</p>
<p>caused it. And then just the final thing is VCs. And I just</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t fathom at this point, given the multiple bank</p>
<p>failures, given that we see the larger problem of unrealized</p>
<p>losses on bank balance sheets, that somehow any class of</p>
<p>depositors would be blamed for this, that just makes no sense</p>
<p>to me.</p>
<p>Chamath, I think the VC, the critique is specific to Silicon</p>
<p>Valley Bank, because I think and this article was in the Wall</p>
<p>Street Journal. But what it shows is a really complicated</p>
<p>intertwined relationship between VCs and Silicon Valley Bank</p>
<p>where, you know, VCs were given very cheap interest rate loans,</p>
<p>they were given GP call lines of credit, they were given LP lines</p>
<p>of credit. And then those same VCs would be directing their</p>
<p>companies to put their deposits inside of SVB, who would then</p>
<p>take those deposits and buy perhaps and buy risk. And while</p>
<p>the reality is all of this stuff will come to light because I</p>
<p>think it will get exposed as we go through congressional</p>
<p>hearings on all of this. But I think the I think pointing the</p>
<p>finger at VCs in this specific case, is somewhat warranted</p>
<p>because there was a little bit of people working in lockstep</p>
<p>together, and there was a lack of functional responsibility</p>
<p>around how to be a true fiduciary. So if you come to a</p>
<p>board, and your founder is 22 years old, and you give that</p>
<p>person 15 or $20 million, I think it makes a fair amount of</p>
<p>sense that you are supposed to be the more sophisticated</p>
<p>financial person in that room. And if you have incentives that</p>
<p>aren&rsquo;t properly disclosed to that CEO, and now a set of</p>
<p>decisions are made, I think that that there should be some</p>
<p>accountability for that, or at least some exploration of why</p>
<p>that happened.</p>
<p>I just want to make sure the audience understands this</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a bit in the weeds. And it&rsquo;s a bit inside</p>
<p>baseball. What you&rsquo;re saying Chamath is, if I can summarize</p>
<p>it, there are people who are the adults in the room, venture</p>
<p>capitalists, they have deposits at Silicon Valley Bank, they</p>
<p>also might have loans that are fantastic. With Silicon Valley</p>
<p>Bank, I have a mortgage for this office from Silicon Valley Bank.</p>
<p>And I talked about how on the last episode, how great it is,</p>
<p>they come, they open wine with you, it&rsquo;s white glove service</p>
<p>that you wouldn&rsquo;t get at another bank. And then they might have</p>
<p>loans against what&rsquo;s called the GP carry or the GP share, or</p>
<p>they might have mortgages. And so there&rsquo;s a conflict there. If</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re a venture capitalist, and you&rsquo;re directing a 22 year old</p>
<p>CEO to Silicon Valley Bank, maybe you&rsquo;re doing that is</p>
<p>a conflict of interest. And in some cases, Silicon Valley Bank</p>
<p>is a limited partner in all of these funds. My point is that</p>
<p>all of these things of interest. Okay, hold on, we have to</p>
<p>explain that. So imagine a situation, you go and start a</p>
<p>fund, Silicon Valley Bank, and says, let me be a limited</p>
<p>partner and invest with you. Let me give you some amount of</p>
<p>money. I don&rsquo;t know where that money comes from from Silicon</p>
<p>Valley. Well, let&rsquo;s be realistic, more like 2550</p>
<p>million, 100 million. Okay, that&rsquo;s a lot of money. So a</p>
<p>million kind of is whitewashing this problem. So you give them a</p>
<p>reasonable amount of money. They&rsquo;re like, wow, I&rsquo;m I have</p>
<p>tremendous loyalty for you. Thank you. Well, do you need</p>
<p>anything else? Do you need personal loans? Do you need</p>
<p>lines of credit for your business? Sure, why not? I take</p>
<p>those two. And invariably, on the back end, now your loyalty</p>
<p>obviously builds up again, nothing, none of this is wrong.</p>
<p>But this is what&rsquo;s happening. And then you tell your</p>
<p>companies to keep your deposits there, maybe the cash management</p>
<p>program is not as strong as it would have been if you were more</p>
<p>circumspect, and you didn&rsquo;t have those incentives to direct</p>
<p>people to one institution only in any other part of the market.</p>
<p>So in the public markets, as an example, there is such a bar for</p>
<p>disclosure. Okay, and I cannot stress this to you enough</p>
<p>related party transactions, all of this stuff. We have to tell</p>
<p>everything not just for us. But even if our like sister or</p>
<p>brother or mother may have a transaction with an entity that</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re doing a deal with. And it just isn&rsquo;t the case in private</p>
<p>markets. And so it&rsquo;s not to say that anything untoward happened.</p>
<p>But when people point the finger at VCs, I think they are</p>
<p>pointing to this whole set of issues and asking the question,</p>
<p>shouldn&rsquo;t there have been more disclosure and transparency</p>
<p>around it? And now that this has come to pass, shouldn&rsquo;t we</p>
<p>explore it? And I think that&rsquo;s what the Wall Street Journal</p>
<p>did, they started pulling on this sweater thread. And my</p>
<p>guess is that you&rsquo;re going to find a whole ball of yarn at the</p>
<p>end of it. Saks, what do you think of this?</p>
<p>I think Chamath makes a fair point that if VCs have SVB as an</p>
<p>investor, and then they&rsquo;re directing startups to use SVB,</p>
<p>that is a conflict that should be disclosed. By the way, we</p>
<p>never did either one of those things. We never had SVB as a</p>
<p>limited partner. And we also never direct our startups to</p>
<p>bank at SVB. I don&rsquo;t know why we&rsquo;d ever do that. Moreover, I</p>
<p>always try to talk founders out of taking venture debt, whether</p>
<p>from SVB or elsewhere. So listen,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;d be clear about that. And to be clear, I never directed</p>
<p>anybody to a specific bank. I know, I told people to get two</p>
<p>or three banks and have redundancy.</p>
<p>Totally. Yeah, totally. And look, founders have multiple</p>
<p>VCs typically on their board. So the idea that like any one VC</p>
<p>directs them, which bank to use, it&rsquo;s just not, that&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>realistically what happens at these startups. But look, I</p>
<p>think Chamath is right that when there is a bank failure or any</p>
<p>kind of failure this big, then all the practices are going to</p>
<p>be under a microscope, and there&rsquo;s going to be some</p>
<p>scrutiny. And maybe there should be. But my larger point is,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re now operating in an environment in which clearly</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a larger set of stresses on the banking system. We&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>already had now five bank failures or near failures.</p>
<p>Moreover, do any of us believe that this is over? Or do we</p>
<p>believe there are more shoes to drop? If we believe that there</p>
<p>are more shoes to drop, we may not know exactly what they are.</p>
<p>But I think all of us probably believe that we&rsquo;re not the end</p>
<p>of this. But But just to finish the thought, if we believe there</p>
<p>will be more shoes to drop, then clearly, the issues cannot just</p>
<p>be limited to Silicon Valley, they have to be a larger set of</p>
<p>issues.</p>
<p>There, I think that it&rsquo;s important to understand the</p>
<p>facility that the Fed created. So what the Fed did this</p>
<p>weekend, is essentially create a buyer of last resort again. Now</p>
<p>how do they do this? So all of these banks basically have</p>
<p>assets that they bought for $1 and are now worth 95 cents. And</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s creating this whole issue or 80 cents or 85</p>
<p>cents, you pick the number, but they&rsquo;re not worth the dollar</p>
<p>that they bought. What the Fed basically said is, okay, give me</p>
<p>that asset, give me that bond, I will value it at $1. And I will</p>
<p>give you $1 as a loan. And you will pay me interest. And the</p>
<p>interest rate, I think is what&rsquo;s called OIS. And they added 10</p>
<p>basis points on top. So I think it&rsquo;s about 4.9%. So what it</p>
<p>allows all of these banks, and if you take all of the banks</p>
<p>that are not the top four in America, so the top four are JP</p>
<p>Morgan, B of a city and well, so just ignore those for one</p>
<p>second, the other end banks, if you look at all of the assets</p>
<p>that are underwater, because of all the rate hikes that Saks</p>
<p>talked about, and you add up all those losses, that is about $2</p>
<p>trillion. And the Fed didn&rsquo;t announce that there was a</p>
<p>beginning and an end to this program, other than saying these</p>
<p>would be one year loans. And so I think the exposure for the</p>
<p>American banking system at a minimum is going to be this $2</p>
<p>trillion. Because now the incentive, if you&rsquo;re a banker</p>
<p>right now running one of these banks that has not gone under,</p>
<p>is to immediately go to the Fed, put all of those assets to them,</p>
<p>get a loan, and now take that and buy different assets,</p>
<p>different bonds, different US treasuries that are yielding</p>
<p>much more than what your old treasuries were yielding. And I</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s the arbitrage that we&rsquo;ve unfortunately created. And</p>
<p>the other question now, though, however, is, what does that mean</p>
<p>for the top four banks? Right? Because if it&rsquo;s 2 trillion for</p>
<p>everybody else, but the top four, what&rsquo;s the gap for the top</p>
<p>four, that looks like it&rsquo;s somewhere between a trillion and</p>
<p>2 trillion. So that&rsquo;s another amount of money we&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>have to cover the federal have to backstop. And then, as</p>
<p>Friedberg said, these checks always come to what do we do in</p>
<p>a year? Because in a year, the problem is, the only way to make</p>
<p>the banks in a position to repay this much money in one year is</p>
<p>to cut interest rates so massively, that these assets</p>
<p>massively inflate. And now all of a sudden, you&rsquo;re in a</p>
<p>position to cover this. So it&rsquo;s a very bad delta is because it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>about they&rsquo;re down 15% 10% in book value these longer term</p>
<p>security. Again, it depends on what they bought. We don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>really know enough detail. So I don&rsquo;t want to guess. But if you</p>
<p>own these 10 year treasuries, you could be off 10 or 15%. If</p>
<p>you own mortgage backed securities, it could be off a</p>
<p>little bit more if you own short term securities, they&rsquo;re off a</p>
<p>little bit less, but these are with the government, you get a</p>
<p>loan collateralized by these assets. So you still holding</p>
<p>them, right? Yes. And they mature. So if the Fed takes an</p>
<p>emergency posture and says, Okay, guys, we want to avert a</p>
<p>crisis in a year from now. And we&rsquo;re going to cut rates, these</p>
<p>assets that these banks own will be worth more, which will allow</p>
<p>them to repay the loan. As far as I can tell, all we&rsquo;ve done is</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve kicked the can down the road for a year. But I do think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s important for people to realize this doesn&rsquo;t solve the</p>
<p>problem. It just means that mark your calendar for a year from</p>
<p>now, we have a problem on March 15 2024. Because all those folks</p>
<p>that took money, what do we do?</p>
<p>Yeah. And so a year to work it out, freeberg would seem like a</p>
<p>good idea, because the Fed is fighting inflation, they seem to</p>
<p>have gotten some portion of it under control. It&rsquo;s not out of</p>
<p>control, right inflation. And maybe if they can slowly, you</p>
<p>know, either start rate cuts or pause. So let&rsquo;s shift the</p>
<p>discussion to, hey, what are the changes we need to make to</p>
<p>the system? And how do we think this plays out over the next</p>
<p>year, freeberg? Chamath had one suggestion, which was all of</p>
<p>these banks should have a disclosure statement, mark to</p>
<p>market every day, week, month, quarter, whatever it is, just</p>
<p>like circles, USDC, their stable coin has a page with their</p>
<p>disclosures of all their holdings. So that seems to be a</p>
<p>very productive one, we should have them mark to market the</p>
<p>Dodd-Frank stuff, as SAC said, you know, Elizabeth Warren,</p>
<p>probably correct, we need to reverse that. So those are two</p>
<p>very tangible suggestions. What are your real time dashboard, we</p>
<p>need to have a real time dashboard at every single Fed</p>
<p>that allows them for every bank that they supervise to know in</p>
<p>real time, they should ignore it. I&rsquo;m not sure that should be</p>
<p>true. But they are their supervisors, they should see it,</p>
<p>they should choose to ignore it, but they should not not have it.</p>
<p>freeberg, what are your suggestions going forward as to</p>
<p>how we can learn from this situation? Forget about the</p>
<p>cannonball, as you vividly expressed there, I think very</p>
<p>well, great analogy. But just going forward, how do we keep</p>
<p>the ship from taking on water, if we do have a cannibal hit it</p>
<p>again?</p>
<p>Now we got a hard, that&rsquo;s a hard equation to solve. We got a lot</p>
<p>of that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m asking you. That&rsquo;s why a lot of demands for</p>
<p>money. You guys see, I think there&rsquo;s a lot of things that are</p>
<p>seem unrelated that are all pretty related right now.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a massive protest underway by labor in France.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a massive protest underway in the Netherlands.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s strikes on the underground in London, when we</p>
<p>talk about global debt, and us debt, we often, I don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>account for all the debt, which also includes promissory</p>
<p>obligations made to a workforce, global workforce that&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>working for decades, individuals that have spent their whole</p>
<p>lives committed to some company or to some government working</p>
<p>with the expectation that they&rsquo;re going to retire and have</p>
<p>some benefits paid to them. And there&rsquo;s this massive under</p>
<p>funding of those benefits and those pools of capital, we very</p>
<p>quickly talk about unfunded pension liabilities. But when</p>
<p>you actually kind of account for the number of people and the</p>
<p>amount of capital that those people are expecting that the</p>
<p>workforce, the global workforce is expecting to be paid to them</p>
<p>in retirement, both public and private. It&rsquo;s a massive amount</p>
<p>of money that&rsquo;s not funded today. And you start to see the</p>
<p>cracks in the system, when that population says, my pension</p>
<p>payments are not keeping up with interest with inflation, or when</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a threat that pension payments or retirement benefits</p>
<p>are going to kick in at a later age, or you&rsquo;re not going to get</p>
<p>them fast enough, you&rsquo;re not going to get as many as you</p>
<p>thought you were going to get. We have that problem the United</p>
<p>States in the form of Social Security and these underfunded</p>
<p>pension liabilities. That is the critical macro tension in this</p>
<p>equation that I think drives the real problem that&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>come to a head at some point, we blew a hole in the in the in the</p>
<p>boat. But we&rsquo;re also forgetting that there&rsquo;s like a massive</p>
<p>amount of weight that&rsquo;s going to drop on the boat. And I think</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s a really hard equation to solve, we can talk about</p>
<p>keeping bank solvent and all this sort of stuff. At the end</p>
<p>of the day, the central bank, it appears in the United States,</p>
<p>and probably globally, it&rsquo;s going to be one big bank, right,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re basically going to take on the whole balance sheet</p>
<p>themselves. And, and at the same time, you&rsquo;ve got a lot of folks</p>
<p>saying, I want to get paid more. I have obligations due to me. And</p>
<p>guess what, you know, Jason, your important statements</p>
<p>historically about the importance of democracies.</p>
<p>Ultimately, you know, the members of that democracy are</p>
<p>going to say, this, this is a benefit that the majority are</p>
<p>owed. And that&rsquo;s going to pull things out. I think the only</p>
<p>stopgap, I&rsquo;ll just say one thing, the only stopgap in the</p>
<p>next decade is going to be significantly higher tax rates</p>
<p>in the United States. I don&rsquo;t see how you&rsquo;re going to fulfill</p>
<p>the tension gap that&rsquo;s underway right now, with respect to where</p>
<p>productivity is going and where capital markets are going, and</p>
<p>where the demands are on the system from people requiring</p>
<p>additional capital to come out to them without taxing assets</p>
<p>away from the asset holders. So this would be corporations and</p>
<p>high net worth people. And I think that&rsquo;s why you see this</p>
<p>Biden proposal. We may not like it. But at the end of the day,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to be the only way to create a stopgap that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to avoid massive inflation in the near term.</p>
<p>Reducing the proposal. Hold on, hold on one second. Let me just</p>
<p>say the only other way the only other I&rsquo;ll just say one more</p>
<p>thing, Jake, I mean, the only other way, besides, you know, a</p>
<p>massive long term tax regime to fill the hole would be some</p>
<p>extraordinary productivity gain. And this is where we can all</p>
<p>have a hope and a dream and an investment and an effort around</p>
<p>technology, AI automation, people think that their energy</p>
<p>job energy, but if you can get energy down below three cents a</p>
<p>kilowatt hour, and you can scale its production by 10 fold,</p>
<p>if you can automate a lot of labor, if you can get AI to do a</p>
<p>lot of stuff that we do today, productivity will go through the</p>
<p>roof, the economy will grow fast enough to get out of the debt</p>
<p>bubble and meet all of these liability obligations. So there</p>
<p>are three ways. Yeah. So I think I think, to me, to me, that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the long term, the medium term is going to be this tax stopgap</p>
<p>is very high tax stopgap. And then the short term is going to</p>
<p>be all the shenanigans that we&rsquo;re talking about. Okay, I&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>go to you in a second sack. So just to recap, there is actually</p>
<p>a third way to there are three ways, productivity, as you very</p>
<p>astutely point out, and we just highlighted some of the ways</p>
<p>productivity could help whether it&rsquo;s energy, AI, etc. The second</p>
<p>is, of course, increasing taxation on the people who are</p>
<p>at the top of the pile would be the likely solution. The third</p>
<p>is also austerity, cutting spending in some way. But let me</p>
<p>also propose one thing here, as we look forward to what do</p>
<p>people want out of a bank? And how should startups or just</p>
<p>individuals deal with bank runs and their trust in banks to</p>
<p>Chamath&rsquo;s point? I was thinking about this over the weekend. And</p>
<p>then this discussion that we would have based on a lot of</p>
<p>things you said, sacks, which was people just deposited their</p>
<p>money, and they don&rsquo;t have the ability to assess if a bank is</p>
<p>solvent, because the FDIC can&rsquo;t do it. And it&rsquo;s their full time</p>
<p>job. It&rsquo;s their mandate to make sure these banks are solvent. So</p>
<p>how is a consumer going to be able to do that? Or even a</p>
<p>startup founder, or even a sophisticated investor, like</p>
<p>Ackman, or any of us, if we&rsquo;re in fact, sophisticated. So let</p>
<p>me pause for a second here and posit something. We don&rsquo;t want a</p>
<p>bank, we want a bank vault. Consumers do not want their</p>
<p>deposits to be used for shenanigans. Just like many</p>
<p>people would rather pay for a social network than have their</p>
<p>privacy data sold. So I think we should bifurcate banks into</p>
<p>bank vaults, and banks, banks can do what they want with your</p>
<p>deposits, you get free checking. But what I want in a</p>
<p>bank, what I want my startups to use what I want my venture firm</p>
<p>to use is I want to pay the bank for services, whether it&rsquo;s 10</p>
<p>basis points, 25 basis points $500 a month, I would rather see</p>
<p>my startups pay $1,000 a month in banking fees $2,000 a month</p>
<p>on banking fees for $2 million, whatever it is, and pay for each</p>
<p>check pay for wires pay for white glove service, whatever</p>
<p>they choose, but not allow the banks to take that money and</p>
<p>loan it out or do things with it. I just want a vault. And I</p>
<p>think a vault service is what the majority of consumers want.</p>
<p>And given what we&rsquo;re seeing with two insane bank run bailouts in</p>
<p>our lifetimes as adults, for those of us who are in Gen X 2008</p>
<p>and now, we would rather pay for services and I leave it to you</p>
<p>sex. Is this a potential solution? Because I don&rsquo;t hear</p>
<p>anybody saying, give me a bank vault. And why does that service</p>
<p>not exist in the world?</p>
<p>Yeah, look, what people really want are they want a service</p>
<p>provider who gives them the ability to make payments, which</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re a small business is payroll and payables, things</p>
<p>like that. They want a money market fund to basically earn</p>
<p>interest. And, and they want all that to be safe. I mean, it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very simple. The idea that when you go open a checking</p>
<p>account at a bank, that you are making an unsecured loan to that</p>
<p>bank, that is not something that any consumer of small business</p>
<p>understands. That whole model, I think, is completely obsolete</p>
<p>and outdated. And what I heard so many people say, and I think</p>
<p>this is not sincere, I think it&rsquo;s just because they hate</p>
<p>tech, is that depositors should take it on the chin. Because</p>
<p>somehow they made a stupid decision when they opened a</p>
<p>checking account. It&rsquo;s like, are you kidding me? Listen, what do</p>
<p>you want the process to be? You want consumers and small</p>
<p>businesses when they open a bank account to have to review the</p>
<p>financial statements of that bank, try to figure out all their</p>
<p>disclosures, where their assets are, whether they have toxic</p>
<p>assets on the books. And if they don&rsquo;t do a good enough job doing</p>
<p>that, if they&rsquo;re not smart enough to do that, then you want</p>
<p>them to be disciplined. This is the word that I kept heard being</p>
<p>used as we need to discipline the depositors. The depositors</p>
<p>are not in a position to evaluate the balance sheet of</p>
<p>these banks. That&rsquo;s what the feds are supposed to do. That&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what the regulators are supposed to do. That&rsquo;s what Moody&rsquo;s is</p>
<p>supposed to do. And you&rsquo;re telling me that a bank that had</p>
<p>an A rating from Moody&rsquo;s the week before, and had an FDIC</p>
<p>seal of approval, that somehow they got it wrong. And the feds</p>
<p>got it wrong. But the</p>
<p>in related news was to get it right. I mean, come on, that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>ridiculous. In related news to mouth, I would like an airbag</p>
<p>in my cars to protect my family. But I don&rsquo;t want to evaluate the</p>
<p>airbag technology and unpack it and make sure that it&rsquo;s got the</p>
<p>right</p>
<p>right. Well, yeah, let me finish the point. It&rsquo;s about consumer</p>
<p>protection here. And I don&rsquo;t care who the depositor is, if</p>
<p>the banking system is going down, because the feds haven&rsquo;t</p>
<p>done their job. I mean, pal, two days before the bank failures</p>
<p>was testifying that he didn&rsquo;t see stress in the banking</p>
<p>system. So either he was lying or asleep at the wheel, but we</p>
<p>are like I said, the feds had given the seal of approval to</p>
<p>SVB and all these other banks, they had all passed the</p>
<p>regulatory exams. And so to now put it on the depositor, when</p>
<p>the Fed screws up, and the regulators screw up, and</p>
<p>Washington screws up by printing all this money and creating this</p>
<p>inflation that we&rsquo;ve had, again, out of all the six parties that</p>
<p>you could blame, I just think it&rsquo;s the least culpable</p>
<p>Chamath should there be a service that provides no</p>
<p>interest, but is just a custodian of money that is</p>
<p>absolutely protected? Where is the bank vault product in the</p>
<p>world? Does it exist? Because I can&rsquo;t seem to find it. Some</p>
<p>people seem to say I think Freeberg, you alluded to this,</p>
<p>maybe in the group chat, that if you have a brokerage account,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s kind of similar to what I&rsquo;m saying, but it doesn&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>it. I don&rsquo;t want any interest. I don&rsquo;t need any interest for</p>
<p>putting this money in the bank for a startup. They&rsquo;re not in</p>
<p>the business of making one to 5%. And optimizing for that I</p>
<p>have founders who are now sending me five page memos, they</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t if we think if Yeah, if the bank can&rsquo;t use your money,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna charge you. So remember, I want to be charged.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the service I know. But I think this is an important</p>
<p>point, a bank is a service provider, they spend a lot of</p>
<p>money building technology, having people that work, they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>providing service and infrastructure. So for the</p>
<p>services that they&rsquo;re offering, if you&rsquo;re not going to let them</p>
<p>use your money to make investments with your money, and</p>
<p>they can participate on that game, they have to charge you,</p>
<p>they charge you. And I think that&rsquo;s really worth that.</p>
<p>Freeberg, Freeberg, not a service provider under the</p>
<p>current laws, you understand how it works now is that what we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>being told is that when you went to the bank thinking you were</p>
<p>just getting a service provider, and frankly, largely a commodity</p>
<p>source provider, you&rsquo;re getting a manager. Yes. And you&rsquo;re being</p>
<p>told that you actually made a risky investment decision. Think</p>
<p>about that. When you open a checking account, you weren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>just trying to, you know, again, use a vendor, you were actually</p>
<p>making a risky investment decision. That&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>trying to say. And you deserve to lose your money if you chose</p>
<p>poorly, even though nobody else could figure it out. None of the</p>
<p>experts could figure it out.</p>
<p>You should talk about the the challenges of your system to</p>
<p>someone who lives in Argentina. It&rsquo;s far worse in other parts of</p>
<p>the world. And we&rsquo;ve come a long way in the last 100 years, we</p>
<p>talked about 500 or 600 bank failures on average per year in</p>
<p>the 1920s. So I&rsquo;m not saying that, hey, that&rsquo;s not the case.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s always been to some degree risk when people are</p>
<p>giving their capital over to someone else. And we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>certainly made huge strides in progress. But I think Jake out</p>
<p>to your point, you know, there is a point of privilege. Now</p>
<p>that people are saying I want to have a position where I know</p>
<p>that my money is not going to get used, not going to get</p>
<p>moved, going to be completely safe.</p>
<p>In a democracy for that, what&rsquo;s the price Freeberg? What would</p>
<p>you pay for that? Because right now we&rsquo;re basically giving every</p>
<p>crypto entrepreneur at zealot, you know, basically the high</p>
<p>ground because they could make this product, I would pay 10</p>
<p>basis points, literally $10,000 a year per million. Is that</p>
<p>right? Yeah.</p>
<p>Remember when you thought Jeff Bezos was going to be</p>
<p>president?</p>
<p>I still think it&rsquo;s a distinct possibility. Anyway, what would</p>
<p>you pay for this product? Chamath or like Bloomberg or</p>
<p>Bezos?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to speculate on new products. It&rsquo;s kind of a dumb</p>
<p>tangent. I think the thing that you&rsquo;re bringing up though is</p>
<p>dumb tangent. Okay. Why doesn&rsquo;t a product like this exist? And I</p>
<p>think that it was very well explained. It&rsquo;s that every</p>
<p>for profit business is in the business of making money. And</p>
<p>there are physical costs that you have to bear. In the case of</p>
<p>a bank, there is physical infrastructure, literally bricks</p>
<p>and mortar that go into making the branches, there are lots of</p>
<p>people, there is lots of software, there&rsquo;s lots of</p>
<p>complex back office and middle office things that banks have to</p>
<p>do in order to accept money that has a cost. So I don&rsquo;t see how</p>
<p>it will be very easy for somebody to create a bank that</p>
<p>just stores your money for you, without you being charged quite</p>
<p>a lot of money. Unfortunately, I think that there has to be a</p>
<p>different way to solve this problem. And I think that what</p>
<p>we did after the great financial crisis was the regulators wrote</p>
<p>down all kinds of new rules. But the crazy thing in 2008,</p>
<p>where those rules were written on paper, and now we&rsquo;re in 2023.</p>
<p>And these rules can be written in software. And so I think what</p>
<p>it requires is some amount of tactical real time intelligence</p>
<p>that regulators need to have over those that they regulate.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know why we&rsquo;re so afraid of demanding that the next</p>
<p>time some of these complicated real time laws are written in</p>
<p>law that they also need to get written in code. And I think</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s a practical solution. It should be the case</p>
<p>that every bank that&rsquo;s supervised by the Fed has a</p>
<p>dashboard that has all of the key levers that allows what you</p>
<p>said Jason to happen, which is a real time mark to market. Should</p>
<p>those or should those be discovered? Or should they not</p>
<p>be disclosed to shareholders? That&rsquo;s a different discussion.</p>
<p>But the regulators should have 100% transparency into how these</p>
<p>organizations run, because as SAC said, they are an enormously</p>
<p>critical institution that at best case after this fiasco,</p>
<p>what we&rsquo;ve realized is very poorly misunderstood by</p>
<p>consumers. And that at the worst case is being mismarketed to us.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I think that shouldn&rsquo;t be allowed.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re also missing the other side of the balance sheet. We</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t talked about it at all. But banks play a really critical</p>
<p>and important role as lenders. banks act as the channel for</p>
<p>lending capital to small businesses for lending capital</p>
<p>to individuals to buy homes. It&rsquo;s the primary place where</p>
<p>capital is provided to help fuel economic growth and prosperity,</p>
<p>particularly in the United States where we have such a</p>
<p>liquid fluid and available mortgage market to support home</p>
<p>buying in America. And the absence of, you know, Jason,</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re talking about, having the ability to use</p>
<p>deposits to make loans, and have what banks have</p>
<p>fundamentally been in this country for over 100 years,</p>
<p>which is taking short term deposits to make long term loans</p>
<p>and making sure that there&rsquo;s some degree of balance and</p>
<p>availability of liquidity to support transactions. And</p>
<p>ultimately, mortgage securities came out of the need to generate</p>
<p>more liquidity by banks to support depositors. And</p>
<p>obviously, there was all these inflationary things that</p>
<p>happened in that market and bubbles that happened. But it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>an important role that banks play. And the lending aspect of</p>
<p>banks if it gets stifled too much, because we swing too far</p>
<p>the other way, it can actually have a really adverse effect on</p>
<p>economic growth and prosperity, and the ability for people to</p>
<p>to afford homes in this country. So that&rsquo;s the other side of the</p>
<p>coin and where things can go bad.</p>
<p>So this is where I find like the the current banking model to be</p>
<p>sort of like weird and maybe obsolete, and definitely not</p>
<p>what consumers expect. So for example, if you go to a bank,</p>
<p>and you put your money in a deposit account, and then they</p>
<p>loan it out to make mortgages, do you realize that you&rsquo;re an</p>
<p>investor in those mortgages as the as the depositor? I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think you do.</p>
<p>I mean, what what they what they do is they take those mortgages</p>
<p>sacks, they package them up, they sell them, and they get an</p>
<p>origination fee and they get the money back.</p>
<p>Not always.</p>
<p>Maybe they should be maybe they should have to</p>
<p>be a Wells Fargo do not exactly. So B of A Wells Fargo, for</p>
<p>example, they do a lot of that. But if you look at First</p>
<p>Republic, they have a $90 billion loan portfolio on their</p>
<p>balance sheet that they&rsquo;ve not packaged up and sold. So the</p>
<p>packaging and selling of mortgages generated the</p>
<p>liquidity that the banks needed. But there&rsquo;s a cost to</p>
<p>that. So a lot of banks will try and balance out their loan</p>
<p>portfolio where they&rsquo;ll package some of it up and sell it. But</p>
<p>when they do that, they take a loss, they pay</p>
<p>maybe they should be required to do that. Because because, because</p>
<p>I mean, look, to the point about mark to market assets, it&rsquo;s very</p>
<p>hard to mark an asset to market unless it&rsquo;s liquid and publicly</p>
<p>traded.</p>
<p>Let me give you an economic point. I think that there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>about $7 trillion in deposits in banks. So if what you guys are</p>
<p>saying happened, you&rsquo;re basically sucking $7 trillion</p>
<p>out of the system that&rsquo;s being used to fuel purchasing in the</p>
<p>form of loans. And you&rsquo;re taking that set or call it a 10%</p>
<p>discount to that. So about call it $6 trillion. And you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>saying, we got to go find a market for $6 trillion of loans.</p>
<p>And then we&rsquo;re going to have $6 trillion of cash sitting in a</p>
<p>bank account doing nothing. And that that challenges</p>
<p>that cash, we&rsquo;re going to money market funds. So in other words,</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;d package up all those mortgage bonds, you create a</p>
<p>mortgage bond security. And then if consumers if depositors want</p>
<p>that product, they&rsquo;ll just buy it.</p>
<p>Yeah, but what is a money market? It&rsquo;s it ends up being</p>
<p>the same thing where money is you earn interest on cash that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>being used to make investments elsewhere. So ultimately, if you</p>
<p>want to earn interest on your cash, it has to be loaned out</p>
<p>somewhere to someone.</p>
<p>I understand. But what I&rsquo;m saying is, look, I&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>brainstorming here. I don&rsquo;t you know, I don&rsquo;t have the spit</p>
<p>balling. Yes, exactly. I&rsquo;m not saying this is what should be</p>
<p>done. I&rsquo;m just kind of asking whether it might make more</p>
<p>sense. What if on the depositor side, all of the things you put</p>
<p>your money in our money market funds, and then when the bank</p>
<p>goes out and does his lending business, it does ultimately at</p>
<p>some point have to package those up, and they get turned into</p>
<p>securities.</p>
<p>You know, sexy, but money market funds. You know where that cash</p>
<p>goes. So when you when you invest in a money market fund,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re giving money to someone who&rsquo;s using it to make a</p>
<p>loan. Like it is also</p>
<p>I understand. But then the depositor would never be marked</p>
<p>to market is sexist point deposit would never be a risk. We never</p>
<p>be a risk of bank failure.</p>
<p>I just want to give you&rsquo;re shifting the risk equation to</p>
<p>the fund manager, the money market instead of the manager of</p>
<p>the bank. And at the end of the day, that money is just the</p>
<p>owner of that security, that money market fund, that would</p>
<p>take the hit.</p>
<p>Okay, just as we wrap here, because I&rsquo;m going to talk on</p>
<p>some other issues as well. There&rsquo;s two things that are</p>
<p>super tangible that founders can do right now are people who want</p>
<p>to mitigate against these kind of issues. There&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>called ICS insured cash sweeps. These are accounts that</p>
<p>automatically, you know, will put your money into multiple</p>
<p>FDI insured institutions, 250 k at a time, we talked about this</p>
<p>previously. There&rsquo;s a bunch of folks doing that in fintech. I</p>
<p>won&rsquo;t give any of them free plugs here. But you can just go</p>
<p>look in search for ICS. There is also maybe some thought here</p>
<p>that the FDIC 250 k limit, maybe that&rsquo;s outdated, certainly for</p>
<p>businesses it is. So maybe that should double or triple. And</p>
<p>obviously that cost would be spread out. And then finally,</p>
<p>you can go to treasury direct.gov right now and buy</p>
<p>short term government debt. And I literally have startups doing</p>
<p>this who have major treasuries. They&rsquo;re going there and buying</p>
<p>short duration stuff themselves, holding it themselves. So they</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have to worry. This is part of this provided by the</p>
<p>government is my understanding and people are buying direct</p>
<p>from the government.</p>
<p>I personally am not a fan of startups buying T bills because</p>
<p>of the duration mismatch problem. They always</p>
<p>underestimate when they&rsquo;re going to need their cash. And so</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like tying up cash.</p>
<p>If you had a giant treasury.</p>
<p>Yeah, but this is always wrong. I see this all the time whenever</p>
<p>they try to say when start trying to create laddered bond</p>
<p>portfolios, they end up needing the money sooner than they</p>
<p>thought. What I&rsquo;d much rather see startup do is buy 100% US T</p>
<p>bill backed money market fund run by the absolute biggest of</p>
<p>the big financial institutions, because you can get in and out</p>
<p>of it at any time you want, and without paying a fee. And that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>so much better than trying to manage your own bond portfolio.</p>
<p>Let a professional fund manager do it.</p>
<p>Well, there are people who do provide these kind of bond</p>
<p>ladders. I&rsquo;m just telling you what the best practice advice</p>
<p>going around your symbol through like a brokerage account, sure,</p>
<p>or multiple ones, right. And but now this is I think, speaks to</p>
<p>Chamath. The fact that we have startup founders and people</p>
<p>having to measure manage a treasury. This granularly, is</p>
<p>this a failure? Or is this what should be happening? Should we</p>
<p>have to have treasuries in the 10 million or $20 million range be</p>
<p>this granularly managed? Or should this just be FDIC rates,</p>
<p>you know, should be just a 10x?</p>
<p>Well, in the absence of regular regulatory changes that protect</p>
<p>this money, you need to have a financially sophisticated actor</p>
<p>on the board. And again, I go back to that should be your</p>
<p>venture capitalist. And that person should not have conflicts</p>
<p>of interest with the banks that they direct you to. I mean, I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t think that that&rsquo;s a very controversial statement.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s just not happening. And I am just flabbergasted that</p>
<p>people are not even doing the basic blocking and tackling</p>
<p>here of having three or four accounts. I&rsquo;ve always had three</p>
<p>or four banking relationships always had it split up. Should</p>
<p>we move on to some of the other pressing issues? There was a</p>
<p>really interesting founders fund story about them breaking their</p>
<p>latest fund in half. And then there is stripe closing their</p>
<p>funding, which one would you gentlemen like to go to or a</p>
<p>different story on the docket?</p>
<p>I think there are, there are four things that are very</p>
<p>interrelated, okay, in startup land. So founders fund took</p>
<p>there, just to make the math simple, because I&rsquo;m going to get</p>
<p>the numbers not exactly right, but like a $2 billion fund that</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going to break into to $1 billion fund. So I think</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s 1.8 billion dollar fund, they&rsquo;re going to break it into</p>
<p>to $900 million funds, it&rsquo;s their eighth fund, it&rsquo;s being</p>
<p>cut in half, and it&rsquo;ll become eight and nine.</p>
<p>I think what that speaks to is valuations, and the marks that</p>
<p>we think we have for existing companies and the future value</p>
<p>that smart investors like this see all roads lead to it says</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re in for a slog. And so trying to put a $2 billion fund</p>
<p>to work doesn&rsquo;t seem to make a lot of economic sense to some of</p>
<p>the smartest people in the room. So that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s that the</p>
<p>second window there, it says, according to Axios, Peter Thiel</p>
<p>led this charge, and he is the contrarians contrarian. He was</p>
<p>the one according to access that led that cut of the fund size</p>
<p>with summit founders fund, according to the reports,</p>
<p>opposing him,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll say the more important thing, which in Peter and I are</p>
<p>in the same, we&rsquo;re the largest LPS in our funds. And so, you</p>
<p>know, as the largest LPS in our funds, I think this is a</p>
<p>no brainer decision. Number two, stripe basically takes a</p>
<p>50% haircut, which is the single best run, most highly valued</p>
<p>company in Silicon Valley. Again, that&rsquo;s going to eviscerate</p>
<p>private company, a lot of TV pi and a lot of people&rsquo;s</p>
<p>portfolios, a lot of theoretical money that LPS we&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>get. I think the third thing is, there&rsquo;s a person that went and</p>
<p>filed a FOIA request that UC Berkeley to get sequoias</p>
<p>returns. And it turns out that the best investor in the game,</p>
<p>quote unquote, since 2018, has not really done that well. And I</p>
<p>think in the University of California, invested over $800</p>
<p>million in Sequoia since 2018. And I think his return, what</p>
<p>some 40 million bucks on that number. And then the fourth</p>
<p>which just came out today is that Tiger wrote down the value</p>
<p>of their private book by 33% for 2022. And so, you know, I think</p>
<p>Tigers am basically has gone from 100 billion to 50 billion</p>
<p>in a year.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s one more note to add to that YC, basically let go of</p>
<p>their growth team this week, Y Combinator, for people didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know what was called the continuity fund, they were doing</p>
<p>late stage investing, and that got cut, gosh, which is a signal</p>
<p>and the 17 employees are gone now. And Gary Tan, I think is</p>
<p>making the right decision. You know, they have to focus on what</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re great at, which is the earliest stage of the company,</p>
<p>and they had conflicts with this one.</p>
<p>Look, this is the most interesting thing. For me in the</p>
<p>following way, I think the Y Combinator unicorn hit rate is</p>
<p>6%. Right. So every 100 companies that come out of YC,</p>
<p>which costs only about $10 million to seed, right, six of</p>
<p>them become worth a billion dollars or more. And obviously,</p>
<p>some become worth much, much more. And so if you see how</p>
<p>difficult it is, even for a growth fund that&rsquo;s attached to</p>
<p>that funnel, to be successful and make money, because</p>
<p>obviously, if this thing was turning cash, you would not have</p>
<p>cut it. I don&rsquo;t think anybody would do that. So I think it was</p>
<p>a very challenging strategy at a challenging moment in time. And</p>
<p>so I applaud these guys for having the discipline to do it.</p>
<p>But if you take them all in totality, it is a complicated</p>
<p>place in venture capital and startup land. Holy mackerel,</p>
<p>like, it&rsquo;s a reset a it&rsquo;s tough to make money be a lot of folks</p>
<p>may not know exactly what they&rsquo;re doing. See, a bunch of</p>
<p>valuations are totally wrong. And D, we&rsquo;re gonna have to start</p>
<p>doing the cleanup work now resetting all of it, which just</p>
<p>takes years as you guys remember, it took us, it took us</p>
<p>five years to fix this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a hard reset sacks. What do you when you look at these in</p>
<p>totality? What would you say?</p>
<p>Well, I agree with what Chamath just said. I mean, it&rsquo;s gonna be</p>
<p>a hard period with a lot of resets, a lot of restructuring,</p>
<p>a lot of cap tables, there&rsquo;s a lot of mess to clean up. All of</p>
<p>that being said, I think I&rsquo;d rather be an investor today than</p>
<p>an investor two years ago, or one year ago. Because at least</p>
<p>the valuations have corrected to some degree. And then also, we</p>
<p>have this really interesting AI wave happening now. And there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a lot of opportunities to invest in that new, you know, cycle. So</p>
<p>at least there&rsquo;s like an interesting product cycle. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>getting me excited to go to work and see these new demos from all</p>
<p>these different companies. Whereas, you know, you go back a</p>
<p>year or two, and just the product innovation doesn&rsquo;t seem</p>
<p>as world changing as it does now. So I think that as bad as</p>
<p>things are, my guess is that the new vintages of VC are going to</p>
<p>be better than, you know, call it 2021. For sure.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not going to be a high bar.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a high bar, but</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the thing. But actually, Chamath, Chamath, this is a</p>
<p>contradiction.</p>
<p>Trash. Trash.</p>
<p>This is the contradiction is that it felt better to be a VC</p>
<p>in 2021. But in hindsight, we know that the vintage is going</p>
<p>to be not good. Whereas today, hold on, but today, it feels not</p>
<p>great to be a VC, but I think the vintages will be a lot</p>
<p>better.</p>
<p>But anybody would tell you that at some point, you&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>have to divorce yourself from emotion to be a reasonably good</p>
<p>investor over long periods of time. How many data points do we</p>
<p>need to realize that too many people were put into this game</p>
<p>that may not have known what they were doing. And we&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to have to go and work through all of those excesses. And I</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s just going to take a lot of time us limited partners</p>
<p>are in a really difficult spot. European investors, I think are</p>
<p>probably in a pretty difficult spot. There are a couple of</p>
<p>bright, bright points around the world of folks that are still</p>
<p>optimistic and doing well. I think Middle East is one Southeast</p>
<p>Asia is another. But other than those, it&rsquo;s just a whole group</p>
<p>of folks that just have to get completely re underwritten from</p>
<p>first principles. Even when you have an incredible platform like</p>
<p>Sequoia, five years of no returns on $800 billion for</p>
<p>somebody like UC Berkeley, what it really means without</p>
<p>commenting on Sequoia performance is that UC Berkeley is</p>
<p>effectively out of business in being a limited partner for the</p>
<p>foreseeable future. Well, right. And I think that has that has</p>
<p>implication. So even if you think these vintages are great,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;re open for business. And and frankly, if</p>
<p>even if they wanted to be open for business, how do you go to</p>
<p>an IC, when they look at all of the totality of those dollars</p>
<p>that have not made anything? How do you justify the next 800</p>
<p>billion? I just think it&rsquo;s very hard.</p>
<p>While I agree that LPS are out of it. I think the story was</p>
<p>garbage, because it all funds go through a J curve. And they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>literally talking about the majority of the funds in that</p>
<p>vintage 2008 2019 2020 21. They&rsquo;re all in literally the</p>
<p>definition of the J curve, the third, fourth, fifth year,</p>
<p>one of the most important things you need to be able to do is</p>
<p>measure how long does it take the delta t to 90% of calling</p>
<p>committed capital? And how long does it take the delta t to</p>
<p>return one x DPI? I can tell you, Jason, if you&rsquo;re a</p>
<p>reasonably good fund, those numbers should be between five</p>
<p>and seven years for both,</p>
<p>which none of those funds have hit the average for a normal</p>
<p>venture fund is around five to seven years to call 90% of the</p>
<p>capital, and around five to seven years to return one x DPI.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just telling you, that&rsquo;s what the average is. And if you</p>
<p>talk to firms, so all I&rsquo;m saying is there was a period of time,</p>
<p>where in the absence of getting money back, again, this is not a</p>
<p>Sequoia thing. Yeah, it just means that there was an entire</p>
<p>cohort, and years of capital allocation that is not</p>
<p>necessarily in a J curve, it&rsquo;s impaired. Because if after five</p>
<p>years, you&rsquo;ve after five years, you&rsquo;ve returned nothing.</p>
<p>Sometimes you just have to see the writing on the wall,</p>
<p>sacks, explain the J curve one more time for folks. And then</p>
<p>what is your analysis of that Sequoia story?</p>
<p>Well, the J curve, the theory behind it is that when you start</p>
<p>deploying a new fund, you&rsquo;re drawing fees down to pay for the</p>
<p>firm and the investments you&rsquo;ve made have not been marked up</p>
<p>yet. So the value of the fund is actually going down, because</p>
<p>some of it&rsquo;s getting eaten up in fees. And you haven&rsquo;t really had</p>
<p>a chance for any of those investments to be successful.</p>
<p>And what happens happen early, right?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even know. I just think it&rsquo;s they haven&rsquo;t had a chance</p>
<p>to get marked up. But then what happens is you start getting</p>
<p>markups. And now at least on paper, the value of the fund</p>
<p>goes up. And then hopefully, those markups eventually turn</p>
<p>into distributions or DPI, like Jamath is talking about. Yeah,</p>
<p>we have a vintage 2017 2018 fund that&rsquo;s actually fully returned</p>
<p>at this point,</p>
<p>you exited some secondaries or acquisitions?</p>
<p>No, we just had some we just had some exits. But look, I think</p>
<p>that is a little bit on the early slash lucky side. But we</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t really seen much of the J because, you know, you should</p>
<p>be getting markups within two years. I think on your</p>
<p>investments, if the companies are looking good, at least</p>
<p>historically, that was the case.</p>
<p>Freeberg, any any thoughts on this collection of stories with</p>
<p>venture, basically having the great venture reset? The end of</p>
<p>the super cycle, the beginning of the next?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>Okay, we&rsquo;re in the thick of it.</p>
<p>But by the way, I would just I would go back to the point that</p>
<p>with all the problems Jamath is talking about the reset and the</p>
<p>wipeout that needs to occur. I think this is still that I think</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s part of what makes this a better time. Absolutely. To be</p>
<p>an investor.</p>
<p>This is what I&rsquo;ll say about that, sex. I think I agree with</p>
<p>you. I disconnect asset values and asset prices from</p>
<p>fundamental business value being created. So the market bid stuff</p>
<p>up prices went up. That doesn&rsquo;t really mean that businesses</p>
<p>aren&rsquo;t fundamentally good that there aren&rsquo;t amazing technology</p>
<p>businesses being built today that are going to affect</p>
<p>billions of lives tomorrow. If you are tracking a public</p>
<p>company stock, and you like the business, you spend time with</p>
<p>management, you see what they&rsquo;re building, you see their revenues</p>
<p>growing, their profits are growing, they&rsquo;re making great</p>
<p>products, people are happy with what they&rsquo;re doing. But the</p>
<p>stock&rsquo;s really expensive. You don&rsquo;t want to buy the stock.</p>
<p>Suddenly the stock drops by 80%. Nothing about the business has</p>
<p>changed. It&rsquo;s just that the market is paying less to own</p>
<p>shares in that company. That&rsquo;s a great time to buy that stock. I</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s the moment we&rsquo;re in in Silicon Valley. Everyone&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like, oh my god, it&rsquo;s over. Things are terrible. Just</p>
<p>because the asset prices of the shares in companies has gone</p>
<p>down, does not mean that the quality of the businesses has</p>
<p>changed, or that there isn&rsquo;t fundamental value being created</p>
<p>in Silicon Valley. In fact, the contrary point to sexist comment</p>
<p>is that it is a great time to be buying these shares. And it is a</p>
<p>great time to be investing. And it is a great time because as</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve talked about countless times, there are extraordinary</p>
<p>technologies, from AI, to biotech becoming software, to</p>
<p>fusion, to novel applications with AI and SAS, and on and on</p>
<p>and on many of the amazing things we&rsquo;ve talked about that I</p>
<p>think can and will affect many industries and billions of lives</p>
<p>are being built today, and they&rsquo;re not going to stop being</p>
<p>built. And you can now buy the stock at 80% off. So, you know,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re investing today, and if you&rsquo;re a builder today, as</p>
<p>long as the capital keeps flowing to support the building</p>
<p>work, which I think to some degree it will because there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>still enough of it sitting there. You&rsquo;re not going to have</p>
<p>a lot of these crazy growthy rounds with high prices and all</p>
<p>the nonsense that went on the last couple years. But there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>certainly a lot of opportunity to create real business value.</p>
<p>And right now an opportunity to buy shares pretty cheap, and</p>
<p>participate meaningfully in that value creation.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you the thing I&rsquo;m seeing on the field and like</p>
<p>playing the game on the field is something we&rsquo;ve been talking</p>
<p>about for the last year. We started a program called founder</p>
<p>dot university and it&rsquo;s basically a 12 week course on</p>
<p>like how to build your MVP. We had 350 people join the discount</p>
<p>people can use to this discount code. It&rsquo;s free for founders,</p>
<p>basically, if they if it&rsquo;s free for founders, if they come to</p>
<p>the 12 weeks. But anyway, what I did was, no, it&rsquo;s founder dot</p>
<p>university because it&rsquo;s an extension. But in the words of</p>
<p>sacks, let me finish. Please let me finish. What we did was we</p>
<p>just said anybody who gets to an MVP, and it&rsquo;s two or three</p>
<p>builder co founders will give them a 25 k check. And I did 20</p>
<p>or 30 of these 25 k checks in the last couple of months of</p>
<p>just the founders right now who have been laid off by other</p>
<p>companies. They&rsquo;re dogged, pragmatic, absolutely</p>
<p>customer centric product centric founders, whereas the last five</p>
<p>years have been filled with theatrics, and white papers and</p>
<p>ICOs and just nonsense and absurd valuations and people</p>
<p>wanting credit for work not done. And now people are</p>
<p>actually building MVPs. And they&rsquo;re dogged, product driven</p>
<p>founders, customer centric, mission driven founders, and it</p>
<p>feels to me that like,</p>
<p>that first part is so well said people wanted all this credit</p>
<p>for work not done, and for progress not achieved. That game</p>
<p>is over.</p>
<p>Finished, finished, which means if you are a product led CEO,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re a mission driven CEO who actually built something,</p>
<p>you stand out so much in this ecosystem, and have people</p>
<p>begging for money, sending me long emails and decks and total</p>
<p>addressable market, I&rsquo;m just like, can you just build a</p>
<p>product and show me that you can actually deliver a product. And</p>
<p>then we&rsquo;ll start the process of the rewards based system here,</p>
<p>you know, the the reward based system in Silicon Valley is so</p>
<p>magical when it works, you get money from Foundry University,</p>
<p>or, you know, Techstars or Y Combinator, then go to a seed</p>
<p>fund, then go to a Series A fund, that milestone based</p>
<p>funding was so broken. And now it&rsquo;s back. And it&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>functional when it&rsquo;s working. It&rsquo;s just a magic of Silicon</p>
<p>Valley is when people work and get rewards, work and get</p>
<p>rewards. And it just creates this great pace and dynamic that</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad to see. Just as we wrap here, everybody&rsquo;s been begging</p>
<p>for a science corner enough about the chaos in the world.</p>
<p>Everybody wants the sultan of science to tell us and educate</p>
<p>us about something. And Saks needs to use the loo anyway. So</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s do a science corner here. Room temperature, super</p>
<p>conductors, you sent me a link, I read the abstract of this</p>
<p>paper. And I don&rsquo;t know which language I need to put this into</p>
<p>Google Translate, but I couldn&rsquo;t understand any of it. So I</p>
<p>literally read the abstract. And I was like, I couldn&rsquo;t get</p>
<p>through the first two sentences without having to start doing</p>
<p>searches. I&rsquo;ll start with just like the simple explainer on</p>
<p>superconductors. You know, materials that conduct</p>
<p>electricity are called conductors. So conductors</p>
<p>electrons move through them like a copper wire. That&rsquo;s how</p>
<p>electricity flows. And all conductors have some amount of</p>
<p>resistance, meaning not all the electrons kind of flow through</p>
<p>at a perfect rate, they bump into the atoms in the material</p>
<p>in the wire, and they generate heat, you know, you&rsquo;ve ever felt</p>
<p>a wire while electricity is flowing through it gets hot,</p>
<p>right. So that&rsquo;s because the conductor has some resistance,</p>
<p>which means the electrons bump into the walls of the atoms in</p>
<p>the material, they generate heat and you lose electricity, you</p>
<p>lose energy, you lose power. And so in 1911, it was discovered</p>
<p>when mercury was reduced to a very, very cold temperature,</p>
<p>that there was a point at which the material conducted</p>
<p>electricity with absolutely no resistance. So the electrons</p>
<p>flowed through the material, completely unbounding on, you</p>
<p>know, not bouncing into the material not generating any</p>
<p>heat. And having no resistance mean you&rsquo;re losing no power in</p>
<p>transmission of that electricity, but a number of</p>
<p>other super interesting effects occur. Number one is that</p>
<p>magnetic fields now reflect off of that metal perfectly. So if</p>
<p>you put a magnet, you ever seen that image of a nick, we could</p>
<p>probably pull one up in the YouTube video, we put a magnet</p>
<p>on top of a superconductor, it actually floats. Because the</p>
<p>magnetic field like the north and the north push against each</p>
<p>other, and it floats up. So superconducting materials kind</p>
<p>of became this fascination in the early 20th century, that oh</p>
<p>my god, if we can actually make materials that superconduct,</p>
<p>there are all these amazing benefits. One of the benefits is</p>
<p>you could have no loss in electricity being transmitted.</p>
<p>Today, 15% of power is lost in the transmission from the power</p>
<p>station to your home. You could also do interesting things like</p>
<p>create maglev or frictionless trains that float, you know,</p>
<p>like magnets floating off the ground on top of a</p>
<p>superconducting track. And by having no friction, you could</p>
<p>push the trap the train once, and you wouldn&rsquo;t need to use any</p>
<p>energy to move it along. So you could have basically powerless</p>
<p>transportation, you could have really powerful, new</p>
<p>microprocessors. So a superconductor microprocessor</p>
<p>instead of a traditional semiconductor microprocessor</p>
<p>would use just 1% of the energy of a semiconductor</p>
<p>microprocessor. Think about that all the AI stuff we&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about all the chips that we&rsquo;re talking about dropping the</p>
<p>energy needs by 99%. If those chips were made from a</p>
<p>superconducting material, and one of the more interesting</p>
<p>applications of superconducting materials could be infinite</p>
<p>battery storage. So you could take a superconductor, turn it</p>
<p>into a coil, and the electricity would just flow through it</p>
<p>infinitely, because it would never turn into heat. And then</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re ready for that power, you just plug in and you</p>
<p>get the power out the actual loss of energy in a</p>
<p>superconductor battery, less than 5%. And that&rsquo;s compared</p>
<p>with, you know, significantly more energy loss used in</p>
<p>chemical systems. And you wouldn&rsquo;t need to kind of get all</p>
<p>the materials that we&rsquo;re struggling to get now to</p>
<p>generate batteries. So the idea of generating like</p>
<p>superconductors and industrial scale has always been super</p>
<p>interesting. Today, the way that we generate superconducting</p>
<p>materials is we have to make a material super, super cold. In</p>
<p>1987, a physicist named Chu developed one of the first</p>
<p>ceramic superconductors where they discovered a new way of</p>
<p>generating superconductivity. It wasn&rsquo;t just taking a metal and</p>
<p>cooling it down very, very cold, because when you get it very,</p>
<p>very cold, the atoms stop moving, and the electrons inside</p>
<p>pair up and it&rsquo;s called Cooper pairing and they flow through.</p>
<p>And he said, we could actually do this with a hotter</p>
<p>temperature. And he demonstrated this in a ceramic</p>
<p>yttrium barium copper oxide, super confusing name. But</p>
<p>basically, he took a bunch of materials and baked them in an</p>
<p>oven. And they turn into this really interesting material that</p>
<p>became superconducting. And then the race was on. Because what he</p>
<p>did is he made a superconductor that could superconduct at the</p>
<p>temperature of liquid nitrogen. And liquid nitrogen is really</p>
<p>cheap. So we can just use and that&rsquo;s actually how all MRI</p>
<p>machines run today is you have superconductors that reflect the</p>
<p>magnetic fields in the soup in the MRI machine, and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>using liquid nitrogen to stay cool. And so there&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>industrial applications today that use superconducting</p>
<p>materials using liquid nitrogen. But in order for us to do all</p>
<p>the stuff I mentioned, like maglev trains and infinite</p>
<p>battery storage, and superconducting microprocessors,</p>
<p>we have to get superconductors, we have to discover a material</p>
<p>that can superconduct at room temperature, so that we can sit</p>
<p>with it in a computer on our desktop, or we can have it run</p>
<p>on a railroad track. Or, you know, we can put it in our</p>
<p>backyard to store energy. And there&rsquo;s been this race and</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s all these different classes of materials that</p>
<p>physicists and material scientists have spent decades</p>
<p>trying to figure out what can superconduct at room</p>
<p>temperature, we started with metals, you know, copper, and we</p>
<p>tried carbon nanotubes and fullerene tubes. We had all</p>
<p>these different ceramics like like was like I talked about,</p>
<p>and there have been literally 10s of 1000s of ceramics that</p>
<p>people bake in ovens and try and see how superconducting they</p>
<p>are. Basically, you take the material, and you cool the</p>
<p>temperature and you measure the resistance. And as soon as it</p>
<p>hits superconductivity, boom, there&rsquo;s this magic moment where</p>
<p>it drops to zero, and it becomes superconducting. And there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>this big changeover effect. So everyone&rsquo;s trying to find that</p>
<p>temperature which it can happen at room temperature. And people</p>
<p>have found superconductivity on the surface of DNA and organic</p>
<p>molecules. But you can&rsquo;t scale that people have found, you</p>
<p>know, superconductivity and all these weird kind of material on</p>
<p>the surface of things, but no one&rsquo;s ever been able to</p>
<p>industrialize it. In 2015, there was a new kind of material</p>
<p>called a hydride, which is basically taking a thin metal</p>
<p>and putting it in hydrogen gas and kind of baking it for a</p>
<p>couple of days, and the hydrogen sticks to the metal. And then</p>
<p>you would use this hydride as a new kind of conductor. And</p>
<p>hydrides, it turned out had really good superconducting</p>
<p>potential, they would superconduct at room</p>
<p>temperature, but they needed super high pressure. So you&rsquo;d</p>
<p>actually have to leave them in like something that&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>hundreds of times the pressure of the atmosphere. And so that</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not really technically and industrially feasible</p>
<p>either. So this guy named Ranga DS published a paper a couple</p>
<p>of weeks ago that got a ton of press, and a ton of controversy.</p>
<p>And basically, he said, Look, I&rsquo;ve got this new hydride. And</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s I&rsquo;ve got this really, you know, weird metal that no one</p>
<p>ever talks about. And I&rsquo;ve baked it with this with hydrogen gas.</p>
<p>And this hydride can actually superconduct at, you know, room</p>
<p>temperature, and at only one gigapascal, which is still</p>
<p>greater pressure than room temperature. But it basically</p>
<p>starts to show on the chart of are we getting there? Can we</p>
<p>actually get there that maybe we are. And so this paper was</p>
<p>published in nature a couple of weeks ago, and it got a ton of a</p>
<p>ton of coverage because everyone&rsquo;s like, Oh my gosh, the</p>
<p>problem is this particular individual. You know, the lead</p>
<p>researcher Ranga DS on the on the paper, he&rsquo;s pretty</p>
<p>controversial, because he made a room temperature</p>
<p>superconducting claim back in 2020, in a paper he published in</p>
<p>nature. And after he made that that claim, a lot of scientists</p>
<p>tried to replicate what he did, and they were not able to. And</p>
<p>then the journal retracted his paper. And he had a method that</p>
<p>he took data noise out of the measurement system he was using.</p>
<p>And the way that he took the data noise out, people said</p>
<p>actually skewed the results and made it look like it was</p>
<p>superconducting when maybe it wasn&rsquo;t. And he actually had a</p>
<p>talk that he did that was published on YouTube, a year</p>
<p>later, where he said he raised $20 million from Sam Altman and</p>
<p>Daniel Eck and a bunch of other investors. And it turns out that</p>
<p>also wasn&rsquo;t true. And then he came back and said, Well, I</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t actually raise the money. I was talking with them about</p>
<p>raising the money. So this guy&rsquo;s kind of a sketchy character in</p>
<p>the space, but the temperature at which he was able to</p>
<p>generate or claims to have generated and he did get peer</p>
<p>review and did get published. A superconductor is at room</p>
<p>temperature, it&rsquo;s at slightly high pressure. But if it&rsquo;s real,</p>
<p>and it does get repeated, it&rsquo;s one of the next steps that we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>almost going to be getting to this point of true room</p>
<p>temperature superconducting materials. And then this whole</p>
<p>industry will blow up transmission lines, battery</p>
<p>storage, maglev trains, superconducting microprocessors.</p>
<p>You know, many new industries can and will emerge from this</p>
<p>material discovery if it&rsquo;s proven to be real. So you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a super interesting storyline, a lot of people in</p>
<p>the material science world and scientists, chemists,</p>
<p>physicists are kind of going crazy about this. And there was</p>
<p>a survey done by quantum magazine, and half the scientists</p>
<p>were like, this is bullshit. And the other half was like, this is</p>
<p>going to change the world. So we don&rsquo;t really know yet where this</p>
<p>is all going to settle out. But I thought it was worth kind of</p>
<p>talking about and bringing it up. Because if room temperature</p>
<p>superconductivity is really realized in the next decade,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s another one of these kind of black swan technology</p>
<p>discoveries that we none of us are thinking about right now.</p>
<p>But it totally transforms all these markets. And very quickly</p>
<p>kind of increases like we were talking about earlier,</p>
<p>productivity makes renewable energy super, super cheap, makes</p>
<p>computing power 99% less power intensive, AI chips will explode</p>
<p>using this technology. So a lot of super interesting applications</p>
<p>if room temperature superconductivity comes to light.</p>
<p>Super interesting story. I thought we should share it and</p>
<p>talk about yeah,</p>
<p>Chamath, I would love to get your insights on it. And then</p>
<p>sacks, I would like to understand how many emails and</p>
<p>what you ordered from Uber eats during that segment. Go ahead,</p>
<p>Venkat Viswanathan, who runs a battery group at Carnegie Mellon</p>
<p>introduced me to Ranga two years ago, me and my partner, Jay, we</p>
<p>were like, holy shit, this is outrageous. And we tried to spin</p>
<p>it out into a natural company. But the University of Rochester</p>
<p>blocked it. And so we&rsquo;ve been following this guy for two years</p>
<p>and all the trials and tribulations. But it&rsquo;s a really,</p>
<p>really exciting thing. If it does come to you got capital</p>
<p>blocked, explain why you would get capital blocked in a</p>
<p>situation like that. Why wouldn&rsquo;t they allow you to spin</p>
<p>it up? It is interesting, because like, typically</p>
<p>universities have a tech transfer office, and you can do</p>
<p>these deals pretty cleanly. So you know, when you go to Stanford,</p>
<p>the tech transfer office is quite sophisticated at MIT, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>quite sophisticated. There are these pretty standardized deals</p>
<p>and, and what is the standard deal? Explain to the audience</p>
<p>how a tech transfer deal would work? And how does the</p>
<p>university make money from it? If you&rsquo;re a prof and you invent</p>
<p>something, or even if you&rsquo;re a student, it&rsquo;s technically owned</p>
<p>by the school. And so if you want to commercialize it, you go</p>
<p>to them and use basically say, here&rsquo;s a capital partner of mine</p>
<p>and we want to go and start a company around it. And what they</p>
<p>will normally say is, okay, great, give us a piece of equity</p>
<p>and give us some royalty in some cases, depending on what it is,</p>
<p>especially the equity tends to be in the mid single digit</p>
<p>percentages, the royalties tend to be in the mid single digit</p>
<p>percentages, it depends on how Okay, yeah, call it 5567%. But</p>
<p>it can be a lot when you think about a, you know, a school like</p>
<p>Stanford who&rsquo;s spinning out hundreds of these things a year.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re if you&rsquo;re a school that doesn&rsquo;t historically do a</p>
<p>lot of tech transfer, or has a lot of cutting edge R&amp;D, you</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t have that team. And so Rochester didn&rsquo;t necessarily</p>
<p>have it. Now look, Ranga is probably getting bombarded by 30</p>
<p>other people who will pay 10 times more than what I was</p>
<p>trying to pay 18 months ago. It&rsquo;s a really interesting thing.</p>
<p>And I think there&rsquo;ll be some there&rsquo;ll be some what&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>anybody know what the top tech transfers of all time were like</p>
<p>was Google a tech transfer free bird, you know, like, yeah,</p>
<p>because he drank was out of the what it&rsquo;s down or take? No,</p>
<p>yeah, Larry and Larry and Sergey gave Stanford, I think one of</p>
<p>the Stanford Yeah, they gave him a percent. Yeah. Wow.</p>
<p>Because backrub was written while Larry was a PhD there. So</p>
<p>technically, they you know, they had some part of it. Carnegie</p>
<p>Mellon ranked as top tech transfer university. I&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>seeing here in terms of the rankings, University of Florida,</p>
<p>Columbia, Stanford, Harvard,</p>
<p>it varies so much, some of them are terrible, like, and some of</p>
<p>them are cronyism. So like, you go to some of the universities</p>
<p>and the tech transfer offices have deep relationships with</p>
<p>certain VCs and investors that they&rsquo;ll only work. And they</p>
<p>always get first picks and first dibs, and they&rsquo;re super tight</p>
<p>with them. They don&rsquo;t run a real market process. And then some</p>
<p>tech transfer offices just give away the farm for nothing. And</p>
<p>then some tech transfer offices think that they own it, and they</p>
<p>should get paid 60% royalties for the thing. It&rsquo;s all over the</p>
<p>map. And some of them are sophisticated, and some of them</p>
<p>are not. So it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s actually quite surprising, J. Cal, how</p>
<p>different all the universities are in terms of their level of</p>
<p>sophistication and the types of deals they&rsquo;ll do. But I will say</p>
<p>this work in superconducting research. It&rsquo;s another good</p>
<p>example, going up to going back to the point a couple episodes</p>
<p>ago about the importance of fundamental research and the</p>
<p>importance of, you know, the support from academic</p>
<p>institutions and governments and other aspects when you&rsquo;re still</p>
<p>not sure what the technology is, that to do that fundamental</p>
<p>discovery work, I think is a good collective social benefit.</p>
<p>And then to industrialize it and commercialize it requires, I</p>
<p>think, a market based approach, which is you take that</p>
<p>capability, try and build a business find customers make</p>
<p>money. And that&rsquo;s really how you get it to be funded to be</p>
<p>scaled. Because you&rsquo;re never gonna you shouldn&rsquo;t have to put,</p>
<p>you know, government and academic money behind that sort</p>
<p>of effort. But private market participants should. And so,</p>
<p>you know, it&rsquo;s interesting. I mean, I think I&rsquo;m not holding my</p>
<p>breath. I&rsquo;ve been, you know, I did a science project in 1993,</p>
<p>when I was probably 12 or 13 years old, on superconductors.</p>
<p>And I got a yttrium barium copper oxide disk. And I got some</p>
<p>liquid nitrogen from UCLA. And I poured it on the disk, and I</p>
<p>floated a magnet above it. And I had a poster board and a</p>
<p>computer presentation back then. And I was super enthralled about</p>
<p>the future of superconductors. And exactly what I said today is</p>
<p>what I said back in 1993. So you know, 30 years ago,</p>
<p>it was so busy dating, I didn&rsquo;t think you had time for</p>
<p>superconductor experiments.</p>
<p>Yeah, look, I don&rsquo;t think I don&rsquo;t think that this stuff has</p>
<p>really, it&rsquo;s been, it&rsquo;s been like fusion, it&rsquo;s always been a</p>
<p>promise around the corner. physicists have always had hope</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve taken incremental steps towards it. But it&rsquo;s always felt</p>
<p>like one of those things, where you&rsquo;re always getting 50% closer</p>
<p>to the wall. It&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re never actually reaching the wall.</p>
<p>And so</p>
<p>anecdotally, one Yeah, by the way, I will say one area that</p>
<p>that that a lot of people think holds a lot of promise for</p>
<p>superconducting research is in quantum computing, because you</p>
<p>can actually model on a molecular level, what might be</p>
<p>going on. Right now, the BCS theory is this theory on Cooper</p>
<p>pairing that happens in ceramics is the only way that we really</p>
<p>understand how superconducting actually works, why it works,</p>
<p>why there&rsquo;s no resistance at certain temperatures for certain</p>
<p>types of materials. For most materials, we have no friggin</p>
<p>clue why it happens. We don&rsquo;t understand the physics of it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something going on on a quantum mechanical level that we</p>
<p>just don&rsquo;t get. And so if we can understand it better through</p>
<p>quantum modeling, using quantum computers, all of a sudden, we</p>
<p>may be able to actually start to come up with ideas for molecules</p>
<p>and crystal structure that would allow us to make superconducting</p>
<p>material that we simply don&rsquo;t have enough time in our lifetime</p>
<p>to run all the experiments in a lab today, and we can simulate</p>
<p>it. And so that&rsquo;s why quantum computing could play a real role</p>
<p>in advancing our ability to do discovery and superconducting</p>
<p>materials. And like I talked about, these are like not just</p>
<p>one, but like two or three order of magnitude improvements in the</p>
<p>efficiency of certain systems of industry on earth today. So it</p>
<p>shows how the compounding benefits of technology and things</p>
<p>you cannot see around the corner can suddenly cause these</p>
<p>explosive growth moments in technology in an industry. I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know what when quantum computing gets here, when it</p>
<p>gets here, it might discover superconducting. And then when</p>
<p>that gets discovered, boom, energy costs drop by 99%</p>
<p>computing goes up by 100 fold. So there&rsquo;s these amazing things</p>
<p>that are still like in front of us that each one of which could</p>
<p>be, you know, really great exponential triggering events.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re seeing a little milestone today. But yeah, I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Saks reaction.</p>
<p>Sounds good.</p>
<p>Saks, how many moves did you play in your 12?</p>
<p>Chess games?</p>
<p>We were was talking about superconducting. How many</p>
<p>points did you go up?</p>
<p>All right, look, I got shit. Let&rsquo;s go.</p>
<p>Oh, sacks. All right, listen, this has been a great episode.</p>
<p>Comment on the Atlantic article that says Ron DeSantis has</p>
<p>peaked already. Oh, don&rsquo;t do it. Don&rsquo;t do it. Why you got to</p>
<p>troll him?</p>
<p>See that but it&rsquo;s in the Atlantic. Oh, you want to know</p>
<p>why the Atlantic suddenly has turned on him is because they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>the biggest backers of the war. They those guys have all these</p>
<p>like neocons over there. And so he gave a statement saying that</p>
<p>you know, our support for Ukraine shouldn&rsquo;t be a blank</p>
<p>check and some other comments expressing, let&rsquo;s say</p>
<p>skepticism of what we&rsquo;re doing over there. And that was</p>
<p>totally unacceptable to them. So all these neocons are</p>
<p>registering disappointment. But I would argue that&rsquo;s a electoral</p>
<p>asset, not a liability.</p>
<p>I have a prediction given what&rsquo;s going on with these banks and</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going on in this kind of a I think we all agree the soft</p>
<p>landing concept is over. We&rsquo;re going to be in a recession. The</p>
<p>war is going to end there because we&rsquo;re not funding this</p>
<p>and American the American public is not going to want to see</p>
<p>10s of billions of dollars go into Ukraine. And to fund this</p>
<p>war in year two or three hundreds of billions. I&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>saying it every month. Yeah.</p>
<p>I know the spending run rate of this war is actually greater</p>
<p>than what we did in Afghanistan and Afghanistan ended up being</p>
<p>a 20 year multi trillion dollar operation that just flushed all</p>
<p>that money down the drain. So yeah,</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;re in a greater run rate than Afghanistan. Yeah.</p>
<p>Do we know what the monthly run rate is for this? Oh my god,</p>
<p>how is it? We&rsquo;ve appropriated over 130 billion Chamath and</p>
<p>Afghanistan, we spent 2 trillion over 20 years. So there&rsquo;s 100</p>
<p>billion a year run rate. Yeah, this is think about what a</p>
<p>monumental waste of money that was and now look at the</p>
<p>financial crisis we&rsquo;re in. Can you imagine if we could have 2</p>
<p>trillion back? I mean, all these trillions that we just</p>
<p>squandered instantly, we would take all those trillions and</p>
<p>trillions we squandered on stuff that didn&rsquo;t matter. And now</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re paying the price for it.</p>
<p>That could be education could be universal health care can be</p>
<p>paying down the debt.</p>
<p>How about paying down the debts? We don&rsquo;t have all this</p>
<p>inflation.</p>
<p>Exactly. Let&rsquo;s think logically here, the number one issue for</p>
<p>this country in the next election, I am with Friedberg</p>
<p>his great prediction from the year end show is we need a</p>
<p>president and we need an administration that is fiscally</p>
<p>responsible and controls the balance sheet in a logical</p>
<p>fashion, like the last two administrations have not seemed</p>
<p>capable of doing I am with Friedberg single issue voter</p>
<p>balance the budget, get spending under control, austerity</p>
<p>measures, hashtag, right for the Sultan of science.</p>
<p>Sorry, what&rsquo;s that? Can you repeat that?</p>
<p>What I wanted to say, Chamath, is there are there any plugs for</p>
<p>the remaining part of the episode? Mr. Beast is curing</p>
<p>blindness and buying people&rsquo;s shoes? Has he been canceled yet?</p>
<p>Aren&rsquo;t you excited about superconductors and the benefit</p>
<p>for AI and energy storage and energy costs and humanity? Yeah,</p>
<p>what does it do to burn rate of a SAS?</p>
<p>Yeah, but I&rsquo;m not I&rsquo;m not like an expert at assessing like hard</p>
<p>science or hard tech. I mean, I&rsquo;m a software investor.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just a simple man. I&rsquo;m just a software investor.</p>
<p>All right, everybody for the rain man himself, David Sachs,</p>
<p>the dictator, Chamath Palihapitiya, and the Sultan of</p>
<p>science, the prince of panic attacks no more. Mr. David</p>
<p>Friedberg. I&rsquo;m the world&rsquo;s greatest moderator, undisputed.</p>
<p>Congratulations, everybody, on another successful episode and</p>
<p>Friedberg. When are we locking in the date for all in summit</p>
<p>2023? My replies, my DMS are filled people want to know. Do</p>
<p>you have the date?</p>
<p>And soon we had a parking issue where they don&rsquo;t want us parking</p>
<p>there. So as soon as we don&rsquo;t need to park there, everybody</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what we told. So now they&rsquo;ve gone back to their</p>
<p>committee to get approval for us doing it without parking and</p>
<p>just doing no parking or walking shuttles or people. Yeah, Uber,</p>
<p>Uber, Uber, Uber. Let&rsquo;s get that. Hopefully, if they accept</p>
<p>it, then we are okay. How many shuttles do we have to take to</p>
<p>Uranus? Yeah, exactly. How am I the prince of panic attacks? I</p>
<p>think you&rsquo;re the king of caps locks at this point. They were</p>
<p>called me J caps. J caps was the best one I heard talking about</p>
<p>panic attacks. Jake hell this weekend, man, panicking,</p>
<p>panicking. I was a sheer terror. Sure. I have literally gotten</p>
<p>rid of the caps lock. Everybody relax. You can follow me</p>
<p>twitter.com slash Jason. We&rsquo;ll see you all next time. Bye bye.</p>
<p>Bye bye.</p>
<p>Let your winners ride.</p>
<p>Rain Man David</p>
<p>sack.</p>
<p>We open source it to the fans and they&rsquo;ve just gone crazy with</p>
<p>it. Love you.</p>
<p>Besties are gone.</p>
<p>Dog taking a notice in your driveway.</p>
<p>We should all just get a room and just have one big huge orgy</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s like this like sexual tension but they just</p>
<p>need to release</p>
<p>waiting to get</p>
