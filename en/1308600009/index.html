    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>where we discuss science</p>
<p>and science-based tools for everyday life.</p>
<p>My name is Andrew Huberman,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology</p>
<p>at Stanford School of Medicine.</p>
<p>This podcast is separate</p>
<p>from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.</p>
<p>It is, however, part of my desire and effort</p>
<p>to bring you zero cost to consumer information</p>
<p>about science and science-related tools.</p>
<p>In keeping with that theme,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank the sponsors of today&rsquo;s podcast.</p>
<p>Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens.</p>
<p>Athletic Greens is an all-in-one</p>
<p>vitamin mineral probiotic drink.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been taking Athletic Greens since 2012,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m delighted that they&rsquo;re sponsoring the podcast.</p>
<p>The reason I started taking Athletic Greens</p>
<p>and the reason I still take Athletic Greens</p>
<p>once or twice a day</p>
<p>is that it helps me cover</p>
<p>all of my basic nutritional needs.</p>
<p>It makes up for any deficiencies that I might have.</p>
<p>In addition, it has probiotics,</p>
<p>which are vital for microbiome health.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done a couple of episodes now</p>
<p>on the so-called gut microbiome</p>
<p>and the ways in which the microbiome interacts</p>
<p>with your immune system,</p>
<p>with your brain to regulate mood,</p>
<p>and essentially with every biological system</p>
<p>relevant to health throughout your brain and body.</p>
<p>With Athletic Greens, I get the vitamins I need,</p>
<p>the minerals I need,</p>
<p>and the probiotics to support my microbiome.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Athletic Greens,</p>
<p>you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>and claim a special offer.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll give you five free travel packs</p>
<p>plus a year supply of vitamin D3 K2.</p>
<p>There are a ton of data now</p>
<p>showing that vitamin D3 is essential</p>
<p>for various aspects of our brain and body health.</p>
<p>Even if we&rsquo;re getting a lot of sunshine,</p>
<p>many of us are still deficient in vitamin D3.</p>
<p>And K2 is also important</p>
<p>because it regulates things like cardiovascular function,</p>
<p>calcium in the body, and so on.</p>
<p>Again, go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>to claim the special offer of the five free travel packs</p>
<p>and the year supply of vitamin D3 K2.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Element.</p>
<p>Element is an electrolyte drink</p>
<p>that has everything you need and nothing you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>That means the exact ratios of electrolytes are an element,</p>
<p>and those are sodium, magnesium, and potassium,</p>
<p>but it has no sugar.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked many times before on this podcast</p>
<p>about the key role of hydration and electrolytes</p>
<p>for nerve cell function, neuron function,</p>
<p>as well as the function of all the cells</p>
<p>and all the tissues and organ systems of the body.</p>
<p>If we have sodium, magnesium, and potassium</p>
<p>present in the proper ratios,</p>
<p>all of those cells function properly</p>
<p>and all our bodily systems can be optimized.</p>
<p>If the electrolytes are not present,</p>
<p>and if hydration is low,</p>
<p>we simply can&rsquo;t think as well as we would otherwise,</p>
<p>our mood is off, hormone systems go off,</p>
<p>our ability to get into physical action,</p>
<p>to engage in endurance and strength,</p>
<p>and all sorts of other things is diminished.</p>
<p>So with Element, you can make sure</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re staying on top of your hydration</p>
<p>and that you&rsquo;re getting the proper ratios of electrolytes.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Element, you can go to drinkelement,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s lmnt.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll get a free Element sample pack</p>
<p>with your purchase.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all delicious.</p>
<p>So again, if you want to try Element,</p>
<p>you can go to elementlmnt.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Thesis.</p>
<p>Thesis makes what are called nootropics,</p>
<p>which means smart drugs.</p>
<p>Now, to be honest, I am not a fan of the term nootropics.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe in smart drugs in the sense that</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe that there&rsquo;s any one substance</p>
<p>or collection of substances that can make us smarter.</p>
<p>I do believe based on science, however,</p>
<p>that there are particular neural circuits</p>
<p>and brain functions that allow us to be more focused,</p>
<p>more alert, access creativity, be more motivated, et cetera.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just the way that the brain works,</p>
<p>different neural circuits for different brain states.</p>
<p>Thesis understands this.</p>
<p>And as far as I know, they&rsquo;re the first nootropics company</p>
<p>to create targeted nootropics for specific outcomes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Thesis for more than six months now,</p>
<p>and I can confidently say that their nootropics</p>
<p>have been a total game changer.</p>
<p>My go-to formula is the clarity formula,</p>
<p>or sometimes I&rsquo;ll use their energy formula before training.</p>
<p>To get your own personalized nootropic starter kit,</p>
<p>go online to takethesis.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>take a three-minute quiz,</p>
<p>and Thesis will send you four different formulas</p>
<p>to try in your first month.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s takethesis.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>and use the code Huberman at checkout</p>
<p>for 10% off your first order.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pleased to announce that the Huberman Lab Podcast</p>
<p>is now partnered with Momentus Supplements.</p>
<p>We partnered with Momentus for several important reasons.</p>
<p>First of all, they ship internationally</p>
<p>because we know that many of you are located</p>
<p>outside of the United States.</p>
<p>Second of all, and perhaps most important,</p>
<p>the quality of their supplements is second to none,</p>
<p>both in terms of purity and precision</p>
<p>of the amounts of the ingredients.</p>
<p>Third, we&rsquo;ve really emphasized supplements</p>
<p>that are single ingredient supplements,</p>
<p>and that are supplied in dosages</p>
<p>that allow you to build a supplementation protocol</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for cost,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for effectiveness,</p>
<p>and that you can add things and remove things</p>
<p>from your protocol in a way</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really systematic and scientific.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to see the supplements</p>
<p>that we partner with Momentus on,</p>
<p>you can go to livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>There you&rsquo;ll see those supplements,</p>
<p>and just keep in mind that we are constantly expanding</p>
<p>the library of supplements available through Momentus</p>
<p>on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about neuroplasticity.</p>
<p>More specifically,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s talk about how we can optimize our brains.</p>
<p>Neuroplasticity is this incredible feature</p>
<p>of our nervous system that allows it to change itself,</p>
<p>even in ways that we consciously decide.</p>
<p>Now, that&rsquo;s an incredible property.</p>
<p>Our liver can&rsquo;t decide to just change itself.</p>
<p>Our spleen can&rsquo;t decide to just change itself</p>
<p>through conscious thought</p>
<p>or through feedback from another person.</p>
<p>The cells in those tissues can make changes, sure,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s our nervous system</p>
<p>that harbors this incredible ability</p>
<p>to direct its own changes in ways that we believe</p>
<p>or we&rsquo;re told will serve us better.</p>
<p>Now, today&rsquo;s a really special episode</p>
<p>because while we are going to talk about science,</p>
<p>and as always, we will delve into mechanism,</p>
<p>today&rsquo;s episode is really geared</p>
<p>toward answering your most common questions</p>
<p>about how to leverage neuroplasticity.</p>
<p>The previous episodes were about focus</p>
<p>and how to achieve focus for sake of plasticity,</p>
<p>as well as the last episode,</p>
<p>which is what are some of the portals into plasticity</p>
<p>that relate to movement?</p>
<p>How behavior can activate plasticity,</p>
<p>as well as how to activate plasticity for behavior itself,</p>
<p>how to get better at learning certain movements.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s podcast is really directed</p>
<p>toward answering your most common questions</p>
<p>and the bigger theme</p>
<p>of how does one go about optimizing their brain</p>
<p>or even think about optimizing the brain?</p>
<p>What is this thing that we&rsquo;re calling optimizing the brain?</p>
<p>In doing so, I&rsquo;m also going to share</p>
<p>some of my typical routines and tools.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t share these</p>
<p>because I think that they are the only ones</p>
<p>that are available out there, certainly they&rsquo;re not,</p>
<p>nor do I share them because I think</p>
<p>that everyone should do them just because I do them,</p>
<p>certainly not.</p>
<p>I share them because many of you</p>
<p>have asked for very concrete examples</p>
<p>of what I do and when,</p>
<p>and so I&rsquo;ll share those with you</p>
<p>and you can decide whether or not those protocols</p>
<p>are for you or not.</p>
<p>Everybody&rsquo;s different,</p>
<p>but there are some common features</p>
<p>of how we are all put together</p>
<p>at the level of the nervous system and body</p>
<p>that direct us toward particular practices,</p>
<p>particular routines that can be especially powerful</p>
<p>for neuroplasticity.</p>
<p>So I want to open up the discussion today</p>
<p>by emphasizing something that&rsquo;s fundamentally important,</p>
<p>which is that plasticity is not the goal.</p>
<p>Plasticity is never the goal.</p>
<p>Plasticity is simply a state or a capacity</p>
<p>for our nervous system to change.</p>
<p>And so nothing makes me more frustrated perhaps</p>
<p>than when I hear, oh, you know, this pill, this potion,</p>
<p>this practice, it gives you plasticity.</p>
<p>Plasticity is just change.</p>
<p>The real question is what are you trying to change</p>
<p>and specifically what end goal are you trying to achieve?</p>
<p>Specific end goals might be extremely specific,</p>
<p>like you want to learn how to speak a particular language</p>
<p>or you want to learn a new motor skill</p>
<p>or you want to get very good at calculus</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;d like to forget the bad emotions</p>
<p>related to a particular human being or experience,</p>
<p>or it can be more general,</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;d like to be more creative.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll actually talk about creativity today.</p>
<p>Or you would like to achieve more focus</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;d like to be less stressed.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s very important that you understand that plasticity</p>
<p>and achieving plasticity is the first step</p>
<p>in what we call optimizing your brain.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want your brain to be plastic all the time.</p>
<p>In fact, one of the major questions,</p>
<p>one of the major unsolved mysteries of neuroscience</p>
<p>is how each and every one of us wakes up every day</p>
<p>and knows who we are.</p>
<p>Why should that be?</p>
<p>Well, the brain is plastic.</p>
<p>It has a capacity to change throughout the lifespan,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not so plastic that every night when we go to sleep</p>
<p>or in our waking that the connections get reconfigured</p>
<p>so much so that we forget who we are</p>
<p>or how to walk or how to eat.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good thing that we don&rsquo;t have such robust plasticity</p>
<p>or ongoing plasticity</p>
<p>that we have to restructure ourselves each day.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s part of what gives our life continuity.</p>
<p>So remember, plasticity is not and is never the goal.</p>
<p>The goal is to figure out how to access plasticity</p>
<p>and then to direct that plasticity</p>
<p>toward particular goals or changes</p>
<p>that you would like to achieve.</p>
<p>And I should just mention,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no rule that in life</p>
<p>you have to leverage this incredible thing</p>
<p>called neuroplasticity.</p>
<p>No one said you had to do that.</p>
<p>This podcast and this episode is particularly for people</p>
<p>who are either happy or unhappy with where they&rsquo;re at</p>
<p>with a particular aspect of their life,</p>
<p>and they want to shift it in some positive way.</p>
<p>And many of you listening might say,</p>
<p>well, wouldn&rsquo;t everyone want to do that?</p>
<p>Well, actually, there are a certain number of people</p>
<p>that are pretty good where they&rsquo;re at</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t want to change, and that&rsquo;s terrific.</p>
<p>And I tip my hat to them, and I think that&rsquo;s wonderful.</p>
<p>If ever they decide that they want to leverage</p>
<p>these plasticity mechanisms,</p>
<p>they can at any stage throughout the lifespan.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start by talking about the different systems</p>
<p>within the nervous system that are available for plasticity.</p>
<p>And in doing so, I&rsquo;ll frame them in the context</p>
<p>of what I do on a daily basis,</p>
<p>on a weekly basis, and on a yearly basis.</p>
<p>First of all, there are several forms of plasticity.</p>
<p>They have names like long-term potentiation,</p>
<p>long-term depression, which has nothing to do</p>
<p>with emotional depression, by the way,</p>
<p>and things like spike timing-dependent plasticity.</p>
<p>Those names are used to describe cellular phenomenon,</p>
<p>the actual ways that the synapses,</p>
<p>the connections between neurons change.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll mention those things, and I&rsquo;ll give a little more meat</p>
<p>as to what they are as I mention them,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s probably not the best way to think</p>
<p>about plasticity in terms of optimizing your brain.</p>
<p>The best way to think about it is in terms of short-term,</p>
<p>medium-term, and long-term plasticity.</p>
<p>Short-term plasticity is any kind of shift</p>
<p>that you want to achieve in the moment or in the day,</p>
<p>but that you don&rsquo;t necessarily want to hold onto forever.</p>
<p>You might say, well, what kinds of things are those?</p>
<p>Well, for instance, short-term plasticity might be</p>
<p>you wake up earlier than you would like to catch a flight,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not feeling particularly alert,</p>
<p>and you want to use a protocol,</p>
<p>or you decide to use a protocol, which could be coffee,</p>
<p>or it could be a certain form of breathing,</p>
<p>or it could be some other tool,</p>
<p>to become more alert at a time of day</p>
<p>when normally you aren&rsquo;t that alert.</p>
<p>But your expectation is that when you return home,</p>
<p>you will discard the need to do that at 5.30 a.m.,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;ll be asleep at 5.30 a.m.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s short-term plasticity, behavioral plasticity.</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s medium-term plasticity,</p>
<p>which are changes that you might want to make.</p>
<p>I call this, with respect and a little bit of humor,</p>
<p>or at least my kind of humor,</p>
<p>I call this the undergraduate pre-med phenomenon.</p>
<p>For those of you that have worked with pre-meds</p>
<p>and have tremendous respect for medical students</p>
<p>and pre-meds, there is a kind of a stereotype,</p>
<p>which I don&rsquo;t necessarily agree with,</p>
<p>but the stereotype is that they want to know</p>
<p>what they need to know for sake of the exam,</p>
<p>but they don&rsquo;t really want to know, they just want the A.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s always true.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve worked with a number of different pre-meds</p>
<p>over the years, and there are many of them</p>
<p>that are absolutely passionate about the knowledge itself,</p>
<p>and they also wanted the A.</p>
<p>But the pre-med phenomenon,</p>
<p>as it&rsquo;s discussed among professors and TAs,</p>
<p>is that you&rsquo;ve got these students,</p>
<p>they just want to know what they need to know</p>
<p>so they can get the A, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s medium-term plasticity.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t actually want it to be embedded</p>
<p>in their memory too long,</p>
<p>or else they would actually care about the information.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s medium-term information.</p>
<p>And sometimes that&rsquo;s useful, for instance,</p>
<p>if you go on vacation to Costa Rica</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t know your way around Costa Rica,</p>
<p>you want to learn the different town and the routes there,</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t have any intention of going back.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just medium-term.</p>
<p>You want to just program it in for sake of your time there,</p>
<p>and then you want to discard it.</p>
<p>Most of the time when we think about</p>
<p>or talk about optimizing the brain,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re talking about long-term plasticity.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking about the kinds of changes</p>
<p>that people want to make</p>
<p>so that their brain reflexively works differently.</p>
<p>This is what a child does when it goes</p>
<p>from not knowing how to walk to knowing how to walk.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t have to think about it</p>
<p>after it learns how to walk, it becomes reflexive.</p>
<p>Long-term plasticity is almost always the big goal.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, I want to know how to speak that language.</p>
<p>I want to be able to do that skill.</p>
<p>I want to be able to feel this way</p>
<p>without having to put much work into it.</p>
<p>And there are tools and protocols</p>
<p>that one can do to achieve that.</p>
<p>And we are going to talk about those.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve talked about a few of them in previous episodes,</p>
<p>but I will revisit those protocols today.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to frame all this</p>
<p>in the context of the daily life,</p>
<p>the weekly life, and the yearly life.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because neuroplasticity and optimizing your brain</p>
<p>rides on a deeper foundation</p>
<p>of this thing that governs plasticity,</p>
<p>and in fact, governs all our life,</p>
<p>called autonomic arousal,</p>
<p>which is that we&rsquo;re asleep for part of the 24-hour cycle</p>
<p>and we are awake almost always.</p>
<p>If we push ourselves and stay awake, we&rsquo;re okay.</p>
<p>We can do that for a night or two,</p>
<p>but almost always we are asleep for a portion of it</p>
<p>and we are awake for a portion of it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve said it before, but I&rsquo;ll say it again.</p>
<p>The trigger for plasticity and learning</p>
<p>occurs during high focus, high alertness states,</p>
<p>not while you&rsquo;re asleep.</p>
<p>And the focus and alertness are both key</p>
<p>because of the neurochemicals associated with those states.</p>
<p>But the actual rewiring and the reconfiguration</p>
<p>of the brain connections happens</p>
<p>during non-sleep deep rest,</p>
<p>which we&rsquo;ll talk more about as always, and deep sleep.</p>
<p>So you trigger the change and in sleep, you get the change.</p>
<p>So some of the things that we&rsquo;ll talk about today</p>
<p>about optimizing the brain are centered around not sleep,</p>
<p>but around the autonomic arousal system.</p>
<p>We have this system of neurons in our brain and body</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just incredible that wake us up and make us alert.</p>
<p>And when we&rsquo;re not accessing that system well,</p>
<p>we cannot access plasticity, we cannot optimize our brain.</p>
<p>Likewise, if we cannot sleep well and we can&rsquo;t rest well,</p>
<p>we will not access plasticity and rewire our brain</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s when the actual configuration</p>
<p>between the connections occurs.</p>
<p>So to set this in context, I wake up each day</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll be totally honest,</p>
<p>I usually don&rsquo;t feel like bouncing right out of bed.</p>
<p>I usually don&rsquo;t feel completely rested.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not because I don&rsquo;t get enough sleep.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably because I&rsquo;m not terrific</p>
<p>about timing my sleep so well.</p>
<p>Now, this month isn&rsquo;t about sleep.</p>
<p>That was the previous month,</p>
<p>but I really want to emphasize a few points.</p>
<p>I wake up generally more tired and groggy than I would like</p>
<p>because I tend to go to sleep too late.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just something that I do.</p>
<p>And I tend to get up early either because I set an alarm,</p>
<p>because I have things to do,</p>
<p>or because I naturally wake up early</p>
<p>because the light coming in and so forth.</p>
<p>Well, what that tells me is that I&rsquo;m probably somebody</p>
<p>whose natural circadian rhythm,</p>
<p>you may have heard of chronotypes.</p>
<p>These are genetically programmed things,</p>
<p>but chronotype is shorter than 24 hours.</p>
<p>It means that the cycle of waking and alertness for me</p>
<p>is probably shorter than 24 hours,</p>
<p>which means that getting some light in the late afternoon</p>
<p>will help me shift and make my cycle a little bit longer.</p>
<p>It will phase delay me.</p>
<p>If that doesn&rsquo;t make any sense, see a previous episode.</p>
<p>But what it really means</p>
<p>is getting some light in the afternoon</p>
<p>will allow me to stay up a little bit later.</p>
<p>But what it means is that I&rsquo;m not really matching</p>
<p>my hardwired needs of going to bed probably at 8.30 or 9</p>
<p>and waking up at 4 a.m.</p>
<p>I tend to go to sleep around 10.30, 11,</p>
<p>lately around 11.30 or 12, and then I wake up at 6.</p>
<p>And so of course I&rsquo;m going to feel groggy.</p>
<p>So neuroplasticity will allow me</p>
<p>to optimize my wakefulness,</p>
<p>but I have to do something in order to access that.</p>
<p>And some of you may already be anticipating</p>
<p>what I&rsquo;m about to say, which is,</p>
<p>oh no, he&rsquo;s going to tell us to get sunlight in our eyes</p>
<p>in the first 30 minutes of the day.</p>
<p>I am going to tell you to do that,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m going to also tell you two things</p>
<p>that I have not discussed before,</p>
<p>which relate to the plasticity</p>
<p>between the melanopsin cells,</p>
<p>these sunlight-detecting, bright light-detecting cells</p>
<p>in our eye and the circadian clock.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never said this before on this podcast,</p>
<p>but it turns out that the connections</p>
<p>between these melanopsin cells and the circadian clock</p>
<p>are plastic throughout the lifespan.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a massive configuration of the connections there,</p>
<p>and a cell type called the astrocytes,</p>
<p>which are a glial cell,</p>
<p>are actively removing and reinforcing connections</p>
<p>between the eye and that clock every day.</p>
<p>Now, this is incredible</p>
<p>because other aspects of your brain that, for instance,</p>
<p>represent you knowing who you are</p>
<p>when you wake up in the morning or what your name is,</p>
<p>assuming that you&rsquo;re old enough</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve already learned your name,</p>
<p>one of the first things kids learn,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s something we rarely ever forget.</p>
<p>Those connections are changing all the time</p>
<p>every 24-hour cycle.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s an opportunity for short-term plasticity.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why I view sunlight first thing in the day.</p>
<p>It helps me wake up.</p>
<p>The other thing that I do is that there&rsquo;s a circuit</p>
<p>that exists between the circadian clock</p>
<p>and our adrenals that I&rsquo;ve talked about before</p>
<p>that triggers the release of cortisol</p>
<p>first thing in the morning that wakes us up,</p>
<p>especially when we view light.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re groggy in the morning,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why viewing light is helpful.</p>
<p>But the interesting thing is</p>
<p>if you start viewing light frequently in the morning,</p>
<p>then those connections between the melanopsin cells</p>
<p>and the circadian clock become primed or potentiated,</p>
<p>we would say, they become stronger</p>
<p>for the anticipation of light.</p>
<p>And you naturally start waking up earlier,</p>
<p>feeling more alert.</p>
<p>So what this says is, and what I do,</p>
<p>is I get that regular light</p>
<p>because I know that some mornings</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just not going to feel very alert.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll feel especially tired.</p>
<p>And I might not be able to access sunlight</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s really overcast or I&rsquo;m traveling</p>
<p>or some other feature, but the system is plastic.</p>
<p>So it shifted in the right direction.</p>
<p>Now it will shift back because it&rsquo;s short-term plasticity</p>
<p>after about two, three days.</p>
<p>So you want to try and get the sunlight exposure</p>
<p>on a regular basis.</p>
<p>The other thing that I do is I delay my intake of caffeine</p>
<p>for the first two hours that I&rsquo;m awake.</p>
<p>Now, this can be very painful for people,</p>
<p>but earlier we talked about the adenosine system</p>
<p>and how the accumulation of adenosine makes us sleepy.</p>
<p>And caffeine suppresses adenosine, it makes us feel alert.</p>
<p>But we know that if you ingest caffeine</p>
<p>immediately on waking,</p>
<p>the signal to the adrenals to release cortisol,</p>
<p>which is a healthy release of cortisol,</p>
<p>and the suppression of adenosine</p>
<p>that happens as we come out of sleep</p>
<p>and in deep sleep, the suppression of adenosine.</p>
<p>If you ingest caffeine too early,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a mechanism by which the adenosine</p>
<p>competes for the receptors, et cetera,</p>
<p>so that you have a mid-morning crash.</p>
<p>Because if caffeine, the way it works is if caffeine</p>
<p>is occupying the adenosine receptor,</p>
<p>then the natural endogenous mechanisms</p>
<p>for suppressing adenosine</p>
<p>are not actually going to have their action.</p>
<p>So the brain to adrenal axis</p>
<p>is subject to plasticity also.</p>
<p>And so by delaying caffeine</p>
<p>until about two hours after waking,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m able to capture and reinforce</p>
<p>to potentiate the neural circuit</p>
<p>that exists between the circadian clock</p>
<p>and the cortisol release in the adrenals,</p>
<p>as well as leave those adenosine receptors unoccupied</p>
<p>so that I can then use the caffeine</p>
<p>to get a natural lift in alertness and focus two hours later,</p>
<p>as opposed to using it</p>
<p>just to wake myself up out of sleepiness.</p>
<p>So while I&rsquo;m sure there are some eye rolls out there</p>
<p>and some yawns about,</p>
<p>oh no, it&rsquo;s the sunlight in the morning thing again,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a powerful tool for readjusting these circuits.</p>
<p>So the short-term plasticity</p>
<p>and the reason for delaying caffeine</p>
<p>for the first two hours of the day,</p>
<p>even if it&rsquo;s painful to do for the first couple of days</p>
<p>is that then you naturally start to wake up</p>
<p>more readily in the morning without caffeine</p>
<p>because the adenosine is suppressed</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t have these competing,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s called a competing antagonist</p>
<p>for the adenosine receptor.</p>
<p>So I wake up, I get sunlight in my eyes,</p>
<p>lately because I wake up very early,</p>
<p>I do use a bright light to stimulate alertness.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not actually designed for that purpose.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a light board that has about 900 lux.</p>
<p>And then I delay caffeine.</p>
<p>Some of you have asked,</p>
<p>and again, I&rsquo;m not saying that anyone has to do this,</p>
<p>you know, what exactly do you drink?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a big believer in black coffee.</p>
<p>I just happen to like black coffee.</p>
<p>People have asked me about,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t want to name brand names here</p>
<p>about this type of coffee or that type of coffee</p>
<p>mixed with these other kinds of things.</p>
<p>Will that increase focus?</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;m going to talk today a lot</p>
<p>about the use of diet and fasting and timing of foods</p>
<p>and certain kinds of foods.</p>
<p>But to be honest,</p>
<p>black coffee is just a simple choice</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s always worked for me.</p>
<p>I also make sure I hydrate first thing in the morning.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s plenty of data now showing</p>
<p>that even a slight increase in dehydration,</p>
<p>meaning just when you&rsquo;re lacking water</p>
<p>can make people have headaches.</p>
<p>It can provide some additional photophobia</p>
<p>for those of you that are migraine prone.</p>
<p>Bright light can trigger migraines.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s no surprise to those of you</p>
<p>that get headaches and migraines,</p>
<p>but dehydration can compound the vulnerability</p>
<p>to migraine and headache.</p>
<p>So I drink water, I drink black coffee,</p>
<p>or I drink mate, which is just a,</p>
<p>because I have Argentine lineage,</p>
<p>which is just a high caffeine drink</p>
<p>first thing in the morning,</p>
<p>but I delay it until two hours after I wake up.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because I want the circuits</p>
<p>between my eye and my circadian clock</p>
<p>and my adrenals to be functioning in a particular way</p>
<p>so that then later the caffeine is an addition,</p>
<p>it adds more alertness.</p>
<p>Now, this is a discussion about how to optimize your brain.</p>
<p>Many people who wake up quickly</p>
<p>and just naturally feel like bouncing out of bed,</p>
<p>I envy these people,</p>
<p>they will do just fine by going into a learning bout</p>
<p>or taking care of whatever it is</p>
<p>that they need to take care of.</p>
<p>Sometimes that&rsquo;s kind of more mundane tasks</p>
<p>like email and whatnot.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a more or less a rule</p>
<p>about how the brain functions vis-a-vis focus,</p>
<p>learning and creativity.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m going to discuss this much more in future episodes.</p>
<p>Generally states of high alertness,</p>
<p>when we&rsquo;re very, very alert</p>
<p>are great for strategy implementation.</p>
<p>When we already know how to do something</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just simply a matter</p>
<p>of plugging the correct elements into the correct boxes.</p>
<p>Things I&rsquo;ve talked before about duration, path and outcome</p>
<p>as the three things that the deliberate conscious brain</p>
<p>is trying to figure out in order to perform certain tasks,</p>
<p>even cognitive tasks.</p>
<p>This is the sort of thing that we are very good at</p>
<p>when we&rsquo;re well-rested and we&rsquo;re focused</p>
<p>and our autonomic arousal or alertness rather</p>
<p>as it is at a high level.</p>
<p>If you are somebody who is hitting that alertness phase</p>
<p>of your day very early, right after you wake up,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a great time to move right into things</p>
<p>that at least the research says,</p>
<p>you already know have the strategy</p>
<p>and you just want to implement the strategy.</p>
<p>This is where I fundamentally depart from the idea that,</p>
<p>oh, you know, you have to do the hardest</p>
<p>or most critical tasks throughout the day.</p>
<p>Sometimes the hardest and most critical tasks</p>
<p>are tasks that require creativity.</p>
<p>And as we&rsquo;ll soon talk about creativity</p>
<p>and tasks related to it,</p>
<p>oftentimes come to us best</p>
<p>or the brain is best at achieving those</p>
<p>when we&rsquo;re in states of calm or even slightly drowsy,</p>
<p>which is something that&rsquo;s interesting and we&rsquo;ll get into.</p>
<p>But for me, for instance, I get up,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not terribly alert first thing.</p>
<p>And so I try and just get my brain</p>
<p>and my thoughts organized.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a time for me to be responding</p>
<p>in a very linear fashion to emails</p>
<p>or carrying out calculations.</p>
<p>That comes about two hours later.</p>
<p>I think many people out there will relate,</p>
<p>mid-morning is when we tend to,</p>
<p>when many people tend to achieve their peak</p>
<p>in alertness and focus.</p>
<p>Now, many times I get the question,</p>
<p>and this is what I&rsquo;m about to say is directly related</p>
<p>to the hundreds of questions I got about this.</p>
<p>Should I use background music in order to learn?</p>
<p>Should I have construction next door?</p>
<p>Is that a good thing or a bad thing?</p>
<p>Is it better to be in complete silence, et cetera?</p>
<p>Now this will vary.</p>
<p>Some people can tolerate their own noise</p>
<p>within their head much better than others.</p>
<p>Other people find that having some background noise</p>
<p>helps cancel that out.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a simple rule of thumb that one can use</p>
<p>because at least my experience is that sometimes</p>
<p>background music, background noise is very helpful</p>
<p>for allowing me to focus.</p>
<p>And other times it&rsquo;s very distracting.</p>
<p>So what actually governs that?</p>
<p>Well, we have to ask ourselves,</p>
<p>what is at the source of the lack of focus?</p>
<p>If our lack of focus is because our autonomic arousal,</p>
<p>our alertness is very, very high.</p>
<p>We had a little too much coffee or we,</p>
<p>if there is such a thing, slept a little too long</p>
<p>or we&rsquo;re really stressed or really activated</p>
<p>and we can&rsquo;t seem to focus.</p>
<p>In that case, eliminating background noise</p>
<p>and really just trying to get silence</p>
<p>so that we can quiet some of that autonomic arousal</p>
<p>is going to be best for learning and for implementation</p>
<p>of things we already know how to do</p>
<p>for any kind of focus linear task,</p>
<p>which basically learning is a focus linear task</p>
<p>is that you&rsquo;re just not necessarily performing it</p>
<p>well all the time.</p>
<p>Last time we talked about making errors.</p>
<p>So as a rule of thumb, if you&rsquo;re feeling too keyed up,</p>
<p>then silence and quiet is going to be helpful.</p>
<p>In fact, if you&rsquo;re very keyed up,</p>
<p>a particular circuit related to the basal ganglia</p>
<p>starts getting triggered more easily.</p>
<p>And this circuit I&rsquo;m going to talk about in depth,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s called the go-no-go circuit.</p>
<p>We have circuits that connect our forebrain</p>
<p>to a structure in our brain called the basal ganglia,</p>
<p>which is actually a collection of structures.</p>
<p>And the forebrain, which is involved in rational thought</p>
<p>and thinking and planning and action</p>
<p>is always trying to plan what should I do</p>
<p>and then implement that action.</p>
<p>And the basal ganglia are intimately involved</p>
<p>in that discussion.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a reciprocal loop of communication</p>
<p>between basal ganglia and cortex.</p>
<p>The basal ganglia has one set of connections to the cortex</p>
<p>and the cortex back to the basal ganglia</p>
<p>that facilitates go.</p>
<p>It facilitates action.</p>
<p>And the molecule, the neuromodulator dopamine,</p>
<p>triggers the activation of go.</p>
<p>It tends to make us want to do more things.</p>
<p>It tends to make us bias toward action</p>
<p>by the way that dopamine binds</p>
<p>to something called the D1 receptors,</p>
<p>just a particular type of dopamine receptor</p>
<p>for those of you that want to know.</p>
<p>The no-go pathway,</p>
<p>the pathway in the basal ganglia and cortex</p>
<p>that suppresses action involves dopamine binding</p>
<p>to this other receptor called the D2 receptor.</p>
<p>Now, D1, D2 receptors, you can&rsquo;t just consciously decide,</p>
<p>oh, I only want my D1 receptors</p>
<p>and my D2 receptors to be active.</p>
<p>You have to think about which sorts of states of mind</p>
<p>and body facilitate go and which ones facilitate no-go.</p>
<p>Now, this is critically important</p>
<p>because doing focused work,</p>
<p>accessing plasticity and learning</p>
<p>involve doing certain things and not doing others.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s how it works</p>
<p>and here&rsquo;s how I apply it on a daily basis.</p>
<p>Because I tend to be most alert first thing mid-morning</p>
<p>or so, and then I generally will have my caffeine</p>
<p>mid-morning, my peak of alertness</p>
<p>in the early part of the day is occurring for me</p>
<p>sometime between 9.30 and 11 a.m.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just me.</p>
<p>Other people might experience that</p>
<p>immediately after rolling out of bed.</p>
<p>They might be wide awake and ready to go,</p>
<p>in which case they should be cautious</p>
<p>about throwing caffeine into the mix</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s going to make them very, very alert.</p>
<p>There are three sort of levels of autonomic arousal,</p>
<p>of alertness that bias us more toward go, no-go, or both.</p>
<p>And this relates to a question</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve gotten now hundreds of times from you</p>
<p>in the comment section for this podcast,</p>
<p>which is, is it better for me to listen to music</p>
<p>in the background while I work and learn</p>
<p>or should I have complete silence?</p>
<p>And the answer is, it depends,</p>
<p>but it doesn&rsquo;t depend randomly on who you are</p>
<p>or even necessarily time of day.</p>
<p>It depends on your overall level of autonomic arousal</p>
<p>and it depends because autonomic arousal,</p>
<p>level of alertness, biases the extent to which</p>
<p>we are more prone to goes, to action, or to no-goes,</p>
<p>to suppress action.</p>
<p>And dopamine is this molecule that&rsquo;s swimming around</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s going to bias one or the other responses.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s how it works.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say I&rsquo;m very alert.</p>
<p>Maybe I got a particularly good night&rsquo;s sleep</p>
<p>the night before, I had a little too much coffee,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m going to sit down to some work.</p>
<p>The thing to know, and what I always tell myself,</p>
<p>is when I&rsquo;m very alert, I am very prone to go, to action,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m also prone to not no-go, right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to be very good at suppressing action.</p>
<p>So those are two different things,</p>
<p>being biased toward action and being biased</p>
<p>towards suppressing action are two different things, okay?</p>
<p>So those are push-pull, toward action, suppress action.</p>
<p>So when you&rsquo;re very alert,</p>
<p>the tendency is for everything to be a stimulus.</p>
<p>This is why when people say,</p>
<p>well, should I just take a drug</p>
<p>like that will increase my level of epinephrine</p>
<p>and alertness, will that help me learn better?</p>
<p>No, because it will make you do things,</p>
<p>but it will also make you less good</p>
<p>at suppressing actions that you need to suppress.</p>
<p>So if I&rsquo;m very alert, particularly alert for me,</p>
<p>and I recognize what that state is, of course,</p>
<p>because everyone will be different.</p>
<p>I know what it is for me.</p>
<p>Then I want silence for learning.</p>
<p>I want to shut down my internet, which I do.</p>
<p>I sometimes use a program that I believe</p>
<p>is a free program called Freedom,</p>
<p>where it actually locks you out of the internet</p>
<p>for a particular time.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not a sponsor of the podcast.</p>
<p>I just happen to use it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s another version of Freedom</p>
<p>where you go to the wireless thing and you turn it off.</p>
<p>You disconnect from the wireless.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the other one.</p>
<p>Although many people have a hard time not reactivating it.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m trying to shut down</p>
<p>the go pathway towards distraction.</p>
<p>And the other thing that I&rsquo;ll do</p>
<p>is I&rsquo;ll generally turn off my phone,</p>
<p>put the phone outside in the car,</p>
<p>or in really extreme cases, I&rsquo;ll throw it up on the roof,</p>
<p>which is hard for me to retrieve so that I can&rsquo;t get to it.</p>
<p>So if I&rsquo;m very alert,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m aware that I will have a bias toward action.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll be hard for me to suppress non-action,</p>
<p>but that it&rsquo;s very nonspecific</p>
<p>because the next kind of level down of alertness</p>
<p>or autonomic arousal is clear, calm, and focused,</p>
<p>where we have that kind of sweet spot</p>
<p>between our willingness to pursue action.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re in a mode of go, and it&rsquo;s not always physical action,</p>
<p>but it can be pursuing hard bouts of learning,</p>
<p>but that our ability to suppress is also very good.</p>
<p>And this is because,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t want to get into too many details,</p>
<p>because of the way that dopamine competes</p>
<p>for these dopamine one receptors in the go pathway</p>
<p>and dopamine two receptors in the no-go pathway,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re always in this kind of push-pull.</p>
<p>And so there is a sweet spot,</p>
<p>and that sweet spot isn&rsquo;t flow,</p>
<p>where it is in some sort of state</p>
<p>where all of a sudden things come naturally to us.</p>
<p>The state that we&rsquo;re trying to achieve</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimal for learning</p>
<p>is one in which we have the energy and focus to pursue,</p>
<p>but we also have the energy and focus to suppress action.</p>
<p>So the basal ganglia are kind of working</p>
<p>in a perfect kind of sing-songy manner</p>
<p>through this parallel pathway.</p>
<p>Now, as we get tired,</p>
<p>or as we round out an ultradian cycle of about 90 minutes,</p>
<p>what happens is our fatigue,</p>
<p>even if it&rsquo;s not a physical fatigue</p>
<p>that makes us want to go to sleep,</p>
<p>but our mental fatigue starts to accumulate</p>
<p>because these pathways of go, no-go</p>
<p>are actually very metabolically consuming.</p>
<p>So what I recognize is that as I start to falter,</p>
<p>I have a harder time engaging and going,</p>
<p>I also know, or going toward the goal rather,</p>
<p>I also know that my reflex</p>
<p>toward actions that are unrelated to the learning</p>
<p>are also going to start increasing</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m not going to be able to suppress the,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to be able to suppress action</p>
<p>and activate the no-go pathway.</p>
<p>So if this all sounds like a mouthful,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s make it very simple for you.</p>
<p>When you are very alert,</p>
<p>the best situation for learning is going to be silence.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be complete quiet.</p>
<p>If you are low arousal and you&rsquo;re tired</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re kind of sleepy,</p>
<p>a lot of people find that having some background chatter</p>
<p>and some background noise</p>
<p>can help elevate their level of autonomic arousal.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because our auditory system</p>
<p>and our visual system are linked</p>
<p>and are part of really what&rsquo;s called the salience network,</p>
<p>which is that we&rsquo;re always scanning</p>
<p>our environment for things.</p>
<p>And when we have a lot of things in our environment to scan,</p>
<p>generally our level of alertness goes up.</p>
<p>This is why environments that are very stark</p>
<p>or have very little or very few objects in them</p>
<p>tend to make us feel kind of calm</p>
<p>because our salience network kind of shuts off.</p>
<p>A lot of people don&rsquo;t like that.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll go to a meditation retreat</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;ll go into an environment</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s very little clutter, especially city people.</p>
<p>And all of a sudden</p>
<p>they start feeling really, really anxious.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because their internal level</p>
<p>of autonomic arousal is really high</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not being occupied</p>
<p>by all this stuff to pay attention to.</p>
<p>And so their salience network starts to turn inward.</p>
<p>They move from exteroception to interoception.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not looking outside themselves,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re looking inside themselves</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a lot of noise in there.</p>
<p>So as a rule of thumb,</p>
<p>if you tend to be kind of on the high level of alertness</p>
<p>and kind of anxiety,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m not talking about clinical levels of anxiety,</p>
<p>but you tend to be pretty high energy,</p>
<p>well then you are definitely going to benefit more</p>
<p>in a learning bout from learning to go</p>
<p>as well as activate the no-go pathway.</p>
<p>And that requires a lot of energy.</p>
<p>And when you have a lot of distractions in your environment,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a high probability</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re going to be distracted from the learning.</p>
<p>Now, some people are just naturally more calm.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like my bulldog Costello, who&rsquo;s exceedingly calm.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re pretty mellow.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re kind of clear, calm, and focused all of the time.</p>
<p>And those people actually are going to be less flappable.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not going to be yanked around by background noise</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;re not going to be around, you know,</p>
<p>bothered from their learning or from their studying</p>
<p>by a clanging of a pot from somebody in the kitchen.</p>
<p>So each one of us generally tends to ride up and down</p>
<p>this autonomic ladder, so to speak,</p>
<p>at different times a day.</p>
<p>For most people, three hours after waking,</p>
<p>those three hours, not three hours on the mark,</p>
<p>but that three-hour bin,</p>
<p>tends to be the period in which they&rsquo;re most alert</p>
<p>throughout the day, except I&rsquo;ll tell you later</p>
<p>about a unique time right before sleep</p>
<p>in which you&rsquo;re also very, very alert naturally.</p>
<p>So that morning three hours is quite vital.</p>
<p>Now, many of you might ask about exercise</p>
<p>and when to exercise.</p>
<p>I think I may have mentioned this</p>
<p>on a previous podcast episode,</p>
<p>but the research shows that at least for performance,</p>
<p>afternoon exercise might be better</p>
<p>in terms of avoiding injury, et cetera.</p>
<p>But in terms of rising body temperatures</p>
<p>and matching body temperature to mental alertness, et cetera,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s pretty clear that exercising early in the day</p>
<p>not only biases us towards waking up earlier,</p>
<p>but that it also triggers the release of things</p>
<p>like epinephrine and other neuromodulators</p>
<p>that lend itself to a situation</p>
<p>where we have heightened levels of arousal</p>
<p>and mental acuity in the late morning</p>
<p>and even into the afternoon.</p>
<p>Now, this can be very good</p>
<p>because if you want to restrict most of your focus learning</p>
<p>to the early part of the day,</p>
<p>exercising early in the day</p>
<p>does set a neurochemical context or milieu for go.</p>
<p>It tends to trigger activation of the go pathway.</p>
<p>And so for those of you like myself</p>
<p>who have a hard time kind of engaging</p>
<p>and getting into action early in the day,</p>
<p>early morning exercise within an hour of waking</p>
<p>and certainly no later than three hours after waking</p>
<p>will give you quote unquote more energy throughout the day.</p>
<p>It will make you feel more biased for action.</p>
<p>You won&rsquo;t feel as lethargic.</p>
<p>So in kind of reviewing what I&rsquo;ve said up until now,</p>
<p>I do the morning light thing.</p>
<p>I delay my caffeine two hours after waking.</p>
<p>And then I generally try and get exercise in the first hour</p>
<p>or ideally within the first three hours of waking up.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;ll move into a focused learning bout.</p>
<p>Now, some of you wrote to me and said,</p>
<p>if I exercise early in the day,</p>
<p>then I feel a crash afterwards.</p>
<p>If that exercise is very, very intense,</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re depleting all your glycogen,</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re doing heavy deadlifts, et cetera,</p>
<p>chances are after you eat, you will start to feel a crash.</p>
<p>So this relates to timing of nutrition.</p>
<p>And in just as a general rule of thumb,</p>
<p>fasted states and low carbohydrate states,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not talking about a keto diet round the clock</p>
<p>or all week, but fasted states</p>
<p>and low carbohydrate states lend themselves to alertness.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because carbohydrates are rich in tryptophan</p>
<p>and they tend to lend themselves to sleepiness.</p>
<p>Of course, ingesting large amounts of any kind of food,</p>
<p>any substance that fills your gut</p>
<p>will divert blood to your gut.</p>
<p>So if you eat a lot of food,</p>
<p>regardless of whether or not it&rsquo;s a lot of carbohydrate</p>
<p>or not, you&rsquo;re going to generally feel more sleepy.</p>
<p>Now, many people, including everyone,</p>
<p>use food to modulate their levels of autonomic arousal.</p>
<p>And typically eating shifts us more towards a state of calm</p>
<p>and fasting shifts us more toward a state of alertness.</p>
<p>And these are hardwired circuits</p>
<p>that relate to the need and desire to find food,</p>
<p>which requires action,</p>
<p>or the so-called rest and digest system,</p>
<p>which diverts our resources and our energy</p>
<p>towards digestion and makes us feel calm.</p>
<p>So I personally rely on water, mate, and black coffee</p>
<p>first thing in the day in order to exercise</p>
<p>and get into the first round of work.</p>
<p>If I find that I&rsquo;m too alert,</p>
<p>then I generally will tend to eat</p>
<p>and kind of bring down my level of alertness</p>
<p>and will continue working.</p>
<p>Now, this isn&rsquo;t a strict thing.</p>
<p>And since people ask me what I do,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m not dictating that people follow it exactly,</p>
<p>of course, or even generally,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ll just tell you what I do.</p>
<p>It is possible if you&rsquo;re drinking black coffee or mate</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re ingesting a lot of water</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re going to dehydrate yourself somewhat</p>
<p>because of excretion of sodium.</p>
<p>Provided you don&rsquo;t have hypertension,</p>
<p>salt is a really good thing.</p>
<p>A lot of people think that they are low on blood sugar</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re shaky and they can&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>or they have a headache</p>
<p>when actually they&rsquo;re low in sodium.</p>
<p>And especially if you&rsquo;re drinking a lot of caffeine.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m a big believer in salt.</p>
<p>So I drink salt water first thing in the morning</p>
<p>because I drink black coffee.</p>
<p>And that keeps my levels of alertness really good.</p>
<p>I always thought that I had messed up blood sugar.</p>
<p>I had shaky hands and I didn&rsquo;t know what was going on.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d drink a little bit of coffee and feel too amped up.</p>
<p>And it turns out that it was a sodium issue.</p>
<p>And if I just drank water with a little bit of sea salt in</p>
<p>or even just a typical table salt,</p>
<p>then I&rsquo;d felt rock solid in terms of my blood sugar.</p>
<p>Now, again, I&rsquo;m not a physician, I&rsquo;m a professor.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t prescribe anything, but I profess lots of things.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t want people who have diabetes</p>
<p>or blood sugar issues to go off the rails.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re responsible for your health, not me.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s an interesting parameter to think about</p>
<p>and experiment with provided that your doctor says it&rsquo;s okay</p>
<p>because I think a lot of people</p>
<p>probably ingest too much sodium,</p>
<p>but a lot of people might be sodium deficient</p>
<p>in particular, the people that are fasting.</p>
<p>I typically eat my first meal right around midday,</p>
<p>whether or not I&rsquo;ve exercised or not.</p>
<p>And the food content there is actually quite important to me.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why this is.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have a scientific mechanism for this,</p>
<p>but if I eat hot food for lunch, I get sleepy after lunch.</p>
<p>So I generally don&rsquo;t eat hot food for lunch.</p>
<p>I might have a little bit of soup or something like that.</p>
<p>But in general, I rely on a low carbohydrate meal.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll eat meat or salad or some variation of that</p>
<p>and nuts and fats and things like that</p>
<p>because of the choline content for focus,</p>
<p>because the protein&rsquo;s good in my belief.</p>
<p>And because I believe in eating fruits and vegetables,</p>
<p>I do that too.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;ve exercised very hard early in the day,</p>
<p>I do ingest starches like oatmeal or rice</p>
<p>and fruit and things like that.</p>
<p>Now, why am I telling you all this?</p>
<p>Because hundreds, if not a thousand people ask me,</p>
<p>is fasting good for focus?</p>
<p>And indeed fasting will increase alertness.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re so hungry or preoccupied with food</p>
<p>that you can&rsquo;t focus,</p>
<p>well, then it&rsquo;s not going to be good for learning.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s only going to be good for agitation.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;m just going to continue to march through my day.</p>
<p>And this is, of course, what I experienced.</p>
<p>Some people are quite different.</p>
<p>But what I find is around two or 3 p.m.,</p>
<p>I start getting a little groggy, a little bit sleepy.</p>
<p>I will tend to shift my work</p>
<p>from work that requires a lot of duration path outcome,</p>
<p>really careful analysis and activation of the no-go pathway,</p>
<p>meaning I&rsquo;m trying to suppress the impulse</p>
<p>to look at my phone or answer email or do other things.</p>
<p>This is why I haven&rsquo;t emailed you back</p>
<p>until three in the afternoon, by the way,</p>
<p>or responded to your text messages,</p>
<p>whoever you are out there.</p>
<p>Around early afternoon,</p>
<p>I find I can do kind of typical, more mundane tasks</p>
<p>because those tasks require less cognitive load</p>
<p>and they can be done more or less in and out of sequence.</p>
<p>I can answer a couple email here,</p>
<p>maybe answer that email there.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have to do it in pure linear fashion.</p>
<p>Any kind of linear work or learning work</p>
<p>is going to take a lot of focus.</p>
<p>And then typically around 4 p.m. or so, I do two things.</p>
<p>Sometimes a little earlier, sometimes a little later,</p>
<p>but I do two things.</p>
<p>One is I make sure I hydrate</p>
<p>because if you&rsquo;re exercising and you&rsquo;re eating,</p>
<p>you need to digest that food, et cetera.</p>
<p>I make sure I hydrate, so I drink water.</p>
<p>I try and refrain from drinking coffee in the afternoon.</p>
<p>This is a new thing for me.</p>
<p>I sometimes do it, but I try and refrain from that.</p>
<p>And then I always do a non-sleep deep rest protocol</p>
<p>sometime in the afternoon.</p>
<p>This is sometimes a 10 minute yoga nidra type protocol</p>
<p>or a 30 minute yoga nidra type protocol.</p>
<p>These are protocols I have no relationship to,</p>
<p>no business relationship to whatsoever.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been doing them for years now.</p>
<p>They involve listening to a script.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll provide the links again,</p>
<p>although we&rsquo;ve provided them before.</p>
<p>Or I&rsquo;ll do a hypnosis protocol from Reverie Health,</p>
<p>which is my colleague David Spiegel&rsquo;s website</p>
<p>that has these free hypnosis apps or scripts</p>
<p>that you can listen to.</p>
<p>And those take me into a state of really deep rest,</p>
<p>sometimes so much so that I fall asleep</p>
<p>and I always set an alarm</p>
<p>so that I don&rsquo;t sleep for longer than 90 minutes.</p>
<p>But typically this goes for about 30 minutes.</p>
<p>And I do that because for me, by about 4.30 in the afternoon,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m capable of doing basically nothing.</p>
<p>I am just a complete Costello.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t think, I can&rsquo;t do, I can&rsquo;t respond to email.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve just completely troughed my ability to function.</p>
<p>I personally find it a mistake to at that point</p>
<p>down a double espresso and charge really hard.</p>
<p>It just doesn&rsquo;t work for me.</p>
<p>I end up really disrupting my sleep schedule.</p>
<p>I end up disrupting a lot of different things.</p>
<p>So for me, I do the non-sleep deep rest protocol.</p>
<p>It really helps me later when I need to fall asleep.</p>
<p>It helps with all sorts of things, as I mentioned before.</p>
<p>But I usually emerge from that a little groggy</p>
<p>or feeling like I have another whole day second wind,</p>
<p>like I could just work, work, work, work, work.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;ll do a second bout of learning.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll do some sort of work</p>
<p>that either involves linear analysis of something.</p>
<p>So maybe numerical work, or I&rsquo;m trying to learn something.</p>
<p>I generally try and really use those bouts</p>
<p>of 90-minute focused energy after the non-sleep deep rest.</p>
<p>And as I mentioned in previous episodes,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of evidence</p>
<p>that these non-sleep deep rest protocols</p>
<p>can enhance and accelerate plasticity.</p>
<p>The most, I think, recent and striking one</p>
<p>is the study that we referenced last time</p>
<p>in the caption notes,</p>
<p>it was the Cell Press article, Cell Reports, great journal,</p>
<p>was showing that these 20-minute kind of shallow naps</p>
<p>and non-sleep deep rest</p>
<p>can facilitate sensory motor learning.</p>
<p>So then I&rsquo;ll go into another learning bout</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s caffeine-free.</p>
<p>This learning bout is very different</p>
<p>than the morning one.</p>
<p>This is a work bout or learning bout</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s more in the clear, calm, and focus regime</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ve come out of this non-sleep deep rest.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not ingesting caffeine</p>
<p>because I want to make sure</p>
<p>that I can sleep later that night really well.</p>
<p>And this tends to be more when I do creative type work.</p>
<p>Now, creativity is a topic</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re going to spend the entire month on</p>
<p>coming up soon,</p>
<p>but creativity is a very interesting state of mind</p>
<p>in which we&rsquo;re taking existing elements,</p>
<p>things that we already know,</p>
<p>and rearranging them in ways that are novel.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d say, well, duh, that&rsquo;s what creativity is.</p>
<p>But creativity has two parts.</p>
<p>It has a creative discovery mode</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re kind of shuffling things around</p>
<p>in a very relaxed way</p>
<p>and kind of being playful</p>
<p>or exploring different configurations.</p>
<p>And then creativity also has</p>
<p>an absolutely linear implementation mode</p>
<p>in which you take the idea or the design you&rsquo;ve come up with</p>
<p>and you create something very robust and concrete.</p>
<p>And so creativity is really a two-part thing.</p>
<p>And the first part</p>
<p>of actively exploring different configurations,</p>
<p>sometimes in a playful way,</p>
<p>sometimes in a way that&rsquo;s almost random</p>
<p>and just kind of exploring,</p>
<p>that state is definitely facilitated</p>
<p>by being relaxed and almost sleepy.</p>
<p>That is not a state</p>
<p>that I personally can access very well early in the day.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve tried to access it coming out of sleep</p>
<p>because one would say,</p>
<p>well, you&rsquo;re still sleepy early in the day.</p>
<p>And it just doesn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>Most of what I write down,</p>
<p>most of what I do is complete garbage.</p>
<p>And so what I found is there&rsquo;s this block in the afternoon</p>
<p>of about 90 minutes where I can do creative type writing</p>
<p>or creative type imagination of scientific ideas</p>
<p>or experiments we might want to do.</p>
<p>Science might not seem like a creative endeavor</p>
<p>to many of you, but it is,</p>
<p>has a lot of imagining what if this,</p>
<p>or we could combine that and thinking of novel concepts</p>
<p>or ways of arranging things.</p>
<p>So when you find yourself</p>
<p>in that kind of clear, common focused mode,</p>
<p>creative works tend to come about very well</p>
<p>in those regimes.</p>
<p>Now, I know that a lot of people out there</p>
<p>rely on substances to access creative states.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a marijuana user.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just not the drug for me for a variety of reasons.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a drinker.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the substance for me for a variety of reasons.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;m not a cop.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not out here to tell people</p>
<p>what they should do or shouldn&rsquo;t do.</p>
<p>The problem with using substances to access creativity</p>
<p>is that generally the substances that relax people</p>
<p>will allow them to get into that creative brainstorming mode</p>
<p>but not so good at the linear implementation mode.</p>
<p>You know, the other day I was remarking with a friend</p>
<p>that there are some ads,</p>
<p>some advertisements that I&rsquo;ve seen over the years</p>
<p>that are just incredible.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just tell you what they are</p>
<p>so that it&rsquo;s not cryptic or anything.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m revealing my taste here.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a one, there&rsquo;s a particular perfume ad</p>
<p>that Spike Jones made that is just amazing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, I&rsquo;ll put a link to it</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s just so cool.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just so, and it has an,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to give away the end,</p>
<p>but it has a feature of it</p>
<p>that is particularly interesting to me as a neuroscientist.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just so cool.</p>
<p>And I, because I grew up in the skateboarding thing,</p>
<p>I knew a little bit about Spike&rsquo;s movies and skateboarding.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s of course made a lot of very impressive,</p>
<p>popular movies as well, full-length features.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know him personally, so this isn&rsquo;t a plug.</p>
<p>Not that he needs my endorsement for anything at all.</p>
<p>But the amazing thing about this advertisement</p>
<p>is it&rsquo;s a kind of, it&rsquo;s a collection of things</p>
<p>that you would never really think would be combined.</p>
<p>And it involves different speeds of motion</p>
<p>and all sorts of effects.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s like a real classic</p>
<p>like Spike Jones kind of delivery.</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s incredible is when you think about</p>
<p>not just the fact that someone had to imagine that,</p>
<p>but to actually implement the steps</p>
<p>in order to create that.</p>
<p>When you see this, you&rsquo;ll realize that was a ton of work.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t just put that together randomly.</p>
<p>And so a lot of people, not Spike, clearly,</p>
<p>but a lot of people who have an incredible mind for ideas</p>
<p>and novel arrangements of things,</p>
<p>they are great at accessing that state,</p>
<p>but not so good at accessing the implementation state.</p>
<p>And then it&rsquo;s also true that a lot of people,</p>
<p>and some who tend to fall on what we would call</p>
<p>the kind of like more Asperger&rsquo;s</p>
<p>or autism end of the spectrum,</p>
<p>are very good at linear implementation.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m not talking about all forms of autism, of course.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sensitive to the fact that there are many forms</p>
<p>on the spectrum.</p>
<p>But some people are very good at linear implementation.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a separate state from a creative states.</p>
<p>So that afternoon block is when I try and access</p>
<p>the freer kind of looser mindset</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s associated with the fatigue</p>
<p>that comes later in the afternoon.</p>
<p>And for some of you, that state that favors creativity</p>
<p>and creative learning might be better in the morning.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to have to decide.</p>
<p>For some of you, you&rsquo;re going to be late shifted.</p>
<p>Some of you are going to be morning shifted.</p>
<p>But where we have alertness,</p>
<p>generally we are good at linear implementation.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re good at activating the no-go pathway</p>
<p>and suppressing action.</p>
<p>And we are good at pursuing particular goals</p>
<p>and strategy implementation.</p>
<p>And where we tend to be more relaxed</p>
<p>and we tend to be almost in a kind of sleepy mode.</p>
<p>So for me coming out of one of these non-sleep</p>
<p>deep rest modes or sleep,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when we tend to be better at novel configurations</p>
<p>of existing elements, which is creativity.</p>
<p>And this brings about a question that I get all the time,</p>
<p>which is what about psychedelics?</p>
<p>So I am going to talk to some experts on psychedelics.</p>
<p>I hope to bring some of them in.</p>
<p>Actually speaking of people coming in</p>
<p>or creatures coming in,</p>
<p>a creature that&rsquo;s definitely not on psychedelics</p>
<p>who doesn&rsquo;t need any is Costello and he just arrived.</p>
<p>He seems to be in a sleepy state most all the time.</p>
<p>Hey buddy, how you doing?</p>
<p>You come in?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s working on his 15th sleep deep rest episode of the day,</p>
<p>which is generally followed</p>
<p>by a 10 to 12 hour deep rest episodes,</p>
<p>almost exclusively comprised of REM.</p>
<p>And I know this because his eyes are open</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re so droopy,</p>
<p>he can&rsquo;t close them all the way.</p>
<p>And his eyes are going like this</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s going down for the count.</p>
<p>So yeah, nice and big yawn.</p>
<p>Okay, so psychedelics.</p>
<p>First of all, I want to be very clear.</p>
<p>I am neither a proponent</p>
<p>nor am I somebody who rejects</p>
<p>the potential role of psychedelics.</p>
<p>I do, however, think that psychedelics</p>
<p>can be particularly hazardous</p>
<p>for people who have preexisting psychological issues</p>
<p>and are not working with a board certified</p>
<p>psychiatrist or physician,</p>
<p>as well as for essentially all kids.</p>
<p>I think that the young brain</p>
<p>is basically in its own psychedelic state</p>
<p>and just naturally.</p>
<p>And all kidding aside,</p>
<p>I think that the young brain</p>
<p>is so subject to neuroplasticity</p>
<p>that drugs like psychedelics,</p>
<p>which are very powerful,</p>
<p>can be detrimental to the developing brain.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just my stance.</p>
<p>If anyone disagrees with me,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be happy to chat with you about it</p>
<p>in a polite and discourse.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be happy to listen</p>
<p>as well as tell you more why I believe that</p>
<p>based on the data.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m mentioning psychedelics</p>
<p>because many of you asked,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s the deal with psychedelics.</p>
<p>At least here&rsquo;s how they work.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, psychedelics were thought</p>
<p>to unleash sensory processing</p>
<p>and to make it less filtered.</p>
<p>We have a lot of different inputs from our eyes,</p>
<p>from our ears, from our nose, from our taste, et cetera,</p>
<p>that are coming in all the time in parallel.</p>
<p>And we have mechanisms that suppress some of those</p>
<p>and allow us to only focus on things</p>
<p>that are happening visually.</p>
<p>Generally, we don&rsquo;t have synesthesias</p>
<p>unless some of us happen to have synesthesia.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t blend what we see with what we hear</p>
<p>in a way that is confusing to us.</p>
<p>We know what&rsquo;s making sounds</p>
<p>and we know what is a visual stimulus.</p>
<p>On psychedelics, people report being able to smell colors</p>
<p>or to hear trees, et cetera.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because there&rsquo;s a lot of sensory blending.</p>
<p>However, that&rsquo;s led to the misconception</p>
<p>that sensory blending itself is a creative process.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing creative about sensory blending.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the essence of a creative process</p>
<p>is that some novel configuration of elements,</p>
<p>whether or not it&rsquo;s notes on a piano</p>
<p>or whether or not it&rsquo;s words on a page,</p>
<p>whether or not it&rsquo;s numbers or whether or not it&rsquo;s movement,</p>
<p>that some way in which those are configured</p>
<p>in some new way, that the algorithm,</p>
<p>the way in which they are configured</p>
<p>makes sense to the observer.</p>
<p>And this is a key thing.</p>
<p>It seems to me that when people report</p>
<p>their psychedelic experiences,</p>
<p>it makes a lot more sense to the person who experiences it</p>
<p>than to the observer.</p>
<p>And so creative works by definition</p>
<p>are new ways of configuring things</p>
<p>that lend themselves to a bigger or greater</p>
<p>or deeper or novel understanding</p>
<p>on the part of the observer.</p>
<p>And just sensory blending is not going to accomplish that.</p>
<p>Now it is true, and there&rsquo;s a great review</p>
<p>in the journal Cell, excellent journal,</p>
<p>about how psychedelics work.</p>
<p>And it turns out they don&rsquo;t just work</p>
<p>by allowing for more sensory blending.</p>
<p>They do, because of the way that they activate</p>
<p>certain serotonin receptors, et cetera,</p>
<p>they do lend themselves to more lateral connectivity</p>
<p>between different brain areas, more novel associations.</p>
<p>So in principle, in principle, I should say,</p>
<p>not necessarily in practice, but in principle,</p>
<p>they do allow different areas of the brain,</p>
<p>maybe even the two sides of the brain</p>
<p>to communicate more broadly than they would normally.</p>
<p>So that has certain elements that speak to creativity,</p>
<p>but it can&rsquo;t simply be the case that psychedelics</p>
<p>are the portal to creativity,</p>
<p>because creativity, as I mentioned before,</p>
<p>involves not just novel associations</p>
<p>and a breaking of kind of space-time rules.</p>
<p>It also involves reconfiguring things</p>
<p>such that the new space-time rule that one comes up with</p>
<p>is interesting, stimulating, and kind of,</p>
<p>in many cases, delightful to the observer.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why many claims that psychedelics open plasticity</p>
<p>or they increase creativity,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not sufficient for me personally.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m curious about,</p>
<p>does it not just open the creative thinking process,</p>
<p>this novel configuration process,</p>
<p>but does it also lend itself</p>
<p>to the implementation of creative works?</p>
<p>And the answer is no.</p>
<p>In most cases, it has nothing to do</p>
<p>with creative implementation.</p>
<p>Now, I think that there may come a time,</p>
<p>and certainly there are clinical trials</p>
<p>that are happening now,</p>
<p>where psychedelics are leveraged</p>
<p>toward particular clinical goals.</p>
<p>And I want to tip my hat to the work at Johns Hopkins</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s happening now,</p>
<p>which really lends itself to the idea</p>
<p>that early preliminary data and some of the papers</p>
<p>that are coming out there are really fantastic,</p>
<p>showing that there may be some excellent roles</p>
<p>for certain psychedelics in certain clinical contexts.</p>
<p>These are clinical studies done with a psychiatrist present</p>
<p>that is authorized to do that,</p>
<p>that can help people through depression, trauma, et cetera.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re going to spend a lot of time talking about that,</p>
<p>including with some of those folks running those studies.</p>
<p>So we can look forward to that.</p>
<p>So all of this is to say that,</p>
<p>no, I don&rsquo;t take psychedelics to access creative states.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not where I think the major role,</p>
<p>the important role of psychedelics might show up</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s going to for humanity.</p>
<p>I think that it may have these important roles</p>
<p>in the clinical context,</p>
<p>provided it&rsquo;s done legally and safely.</p>
<p>I think that the creative process being a two-stage process</p>
<p>means that I am personally best served</p>
<p>by having this period of nonlinear exploration of concepts,</p>
<p>whatever it is I happen to be working on in the afternoon,</p>
<p>but then I&rsquo;ll actually shelve that work.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just set it aside</p>
<p>and then I&rsquo;ll revisit it the next day or even the next day</p>
<p>to see whether or not that the work itself</p>
<p>is ready for deliberate linear implementation,</p>
<p>which I would want to do</p>
<p>during one of these highly focused states.</p>
<p>So the long and short way of saying this</p>
<p>is that when we&rsquo;re very alert, do linear type of operations.</p>
<p>When we tend to be more sleepy and more relaxed,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when creative works can first be conceived,</p>
<p>but their implementation requires high levels of alertness.</p>
<p>Now that gets us more to the kind of late afternoon evening.</p>
<p>Now I am, as I&rsquo;ve mentioned before,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a proponent of getting sunlight in the evening as well.</p>
<p>This is a critical thing that I have not mentioned before.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how it works.</p>
<p>Many people now have heard me say</p>
<p>getting light early in the day is important,</p>
<p>but that will advance one&rsquo;s clock.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll make you want to get up earlier the next day.</p>
<p>By getting light in the evening,</p>
<p>it accomplishes two things for me.</p>
<p>First of all, it makes sure that I don&rsquo;t get up too early,</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m not waking up at three or four in the morning</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s going to shift my clock.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to delay it a little bit.</p>
<p>And so this is really important.</p>
<p>If you want to keep your schedule on a normal routine</p>
<p>on a regular 24-hour cycle</p>
<p>and not have your circadian rhythms</p>
<p>of sleep and wakefulness drifting all over the place,</p>
<p>and you want some predictability</p>
<p>to how your mind is going to work</p>
<p>in order to optimize learning and performance,</p>
<p>well, then you need to get morning light and evening light.</p>
<p>The morning light is going to advance my clock,</p>
<p>make my system want to get up earlier.</p>
<p>And the evening light is going to delay my clock</p>
<p>a little bit so that on average,</p>
<p>it kind of bookends my circadian mechanisms.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll basically want to go to sleep</p>
<p>at more or less the same time each night and wake up</p>
<p>more or less at the same time each morning.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how it works.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a hardwired mechanism.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not some subjective thing that I tell myself.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a hardwired mechanism.</p>
<p>So that gets us to the evening.</p>
<p>And generally in the evening,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll get that light by going outside,</p>
<p>or sometimes I&rsquo;ll do it</p>
<p>by turning up artificial lights brightly,</p>
<p>and then I&rsquo;ll start to dim them for the evening</p>
<p>because as I&rsquo;ve mentioned many times before,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m not going to belabor the point,</p>
<p>you want to minimize your light exposure,</p>
<p>especially overhead bright light exposure,</p>
<p>regardless of whether or not it&rsquo;s blue light or not,</p>
<p>in the evening from about 10 p.m. to 4 a.m.</p>
<p>Some of you asked, wait, I thought it was 11 p.m. to 4 a.m.</p>
<p>Well, it is, but 10 p.m. to 4 a.m. is even better.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that when I originally said 10 p.m. to 4 a.m.,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s impossible for most people to adhere to.</p>
<p>So for me, it&rsquo;s screens off, it&rsquo;s dim lights,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what favors falling asleep</p>
<p>in a good night&rsquo;s sleep for me.</p>
<p>Since we were talking about food earlier,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just revisit a little bit of what I said before.</p>
<p>My evening meal tends to be more carbohydrate-rich,</p>
<p>if I have proteins, it&rsquo;ll be like eggs, fish, or chicken,</p>
<p>or something of that sort, or no protein.</p>
<p>And I eat high carbohydrates.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not one of these people</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s keto or high meat only or anything like that.</p>
<p>Remember, fasting in low-carbohydrate states</p>
<p>facilitate alertness.</p>
<p>Carbohydrate-rich foods facilitate calmness and sleepiness.</p>
<p>They stimulate the release of tryptophan</p>
<p>and the transition to sleep.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why I do them late in the day.</p>
<p>Also, if you&rsquo;ve exercised early in the day,</p>
<p>especially if it&rsquo;s weight-bearing exercise,</p>
<p>or everything&rsquo;s weight-bearing exercise,</p>
<p>I suppose, unless you&rsquo;re an astronaut, and you&rsquo;re in space.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re early in the day exercising with weights,</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re doing a long run or something,</p>
<p>sooner or later, you need to replenish glycogen.</p>
<p>And I realized that the ketonistas out there</p>
<p>are going to say, well, you know,</p>
<p>gluconeogenesis will allow you</p>
<p>to replenish glycogen, et cetera.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just going to call out the lie right now,</p>
<p>because I feel like doing it,</p>
<p>and because I think it just hasn&rsquo;t been stated,</p>
<p>which is that not everybody,</p>
<p>but a lot of the people that are proponents</p>
<p>of high-meat keto diets, fine.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fine if that&rsquo;s what they want to do.</p>
<p>And as you recall,</p>
<p>I do relatively ketogenic diet during the day</p>
<p>to for alertness or fasting.</p>
<p>But a lot of those people</p>
<p>can replenish glycogen really well</p>
<p>without ingesting carbohydrates,</p>
<p>so-called gluconeogenesis and enhanced protein synthesis,</p>
<p>because they are hormone-enhanced.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just, I&rsquo;ve been around a while,</p>
<p>I know what this looks like.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re either thyroid-enhanced or hormone-enhanced,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t pass any judgment.</p>
<p>But when you look at people who look amazing on keto</p>
<p>and are able to have a lot of energy</p>
<p>and replenish their glycogen on keto,</p>
<p>they are in many cases, not all,</p>
<p>but in many cases, they&rsquo;re hormone-enhanced.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re taking exogenous hormones</p>
<p>that allow them to synthesize and repair muscle</p>
<p>in ways that people</p>
<p>who aren&rsquo;t taking those exogenous hormones can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>This is not just true of the men, by the way.</p>
<p>This is also true of the women.</p>
<p>And this is a whole discussion unto itself,</p>
<p>probably not directly related to this month of the podcast.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t mind that people do this,</p>
<p>but one problem is when people are following</p>
<p>ketogenic diets all the way through to sleep</p>
<p>and they have trouble with sleep</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;re doing long bouts of fasting</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re having trouble falling asleep,</p>
<p>that makes sense.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because their autonomic arousal</p>
<p>is tilted towards epinephrine release,</p>
<p>norepinephrine release, and dopamine release.</p>
<p>So they have a lot of energy,</p>
<p>but they have a hard time calming down</p>
<p>and getting into deep sleep.</p>
<p>I tend to achieve that state using carbohydrates,</p>
<p>and it also replenishes glycogen.</p>
<p>So again, I&rsquo;m not trying to draw any fire,</p>
<p>but if I do, I&rsquo;d be happy to have a conversation</p>
<p>about all that.</p>
<p>Again, no judgment,</p>
<p>but I think that most people out there</p>
<p>are not aware of some of the other variables.</p>
<p>Remember, good science is about isolating variables.</p>
<p>And so oftentimes what we&rsquo;re seeing in social media</p>
<p>is we&rsquo;re getting presented single variables</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re not seeing the full context</p>
<p>of the other variables that are being manipulated.</p>
<p>So I eat pasta and rice and vegetables</p>
<p>and things like that in the evening.</p>
<p>Also, I just find maybe I&rsquo;m becoming</p>
<p>one of the last people that does that,</p>
<p>although I hope not.</p>
<p>I hope there are others out there like me,</p>
<p>but I just, from all the literature,</p>
<p>speaks to the fact that carbohydrates not only do that,</p>
<p>but they also help maintain</p>
<p>healthy thyroid function, et cetera.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s my bias, that&rsquo;s what I do.</p>
<p>I do avoid caffeine and whatnot in the evening.</p>
<p>I do take supplements and I&rsquo;ll be happy at some point</p>
<p>to put out the complete list of supplements</p>
<p>that I take out there.</p>
<p>But in general, these are the core things that I do</p>
<p>and they relate to a lot of the questions</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve been asking over time.</p>
<p>The next piece of scientific data that I&rsquo;m going to describe</p>
<p>is a very important piece of scientific data</p>
<p>for sake of understanding how to optimize your brain</p>
<p>and access sleep.</p>
<p>It also can help avoid a lot of anxiety issues.</p>
<p>And these relate to data from Charles Zeisler,</p>
<p>doctor, he&rsquo;s an MD,</p>
<p>Chuck Zeisler&rsquo;s lab at Harvard Medical School.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s run a sleep lab out of Harvard Medical School</p>
<p>for a long time now, does very impressive work.</p>
<p>And what he&rsquo;s shown is that the peak output</p>
<p>of the circadian clock for wakefulness,</p>
<p>in other words, the peak of our wakefulness</p>
<p>and the suppression of the sleep signal</p>
<p>actually happens very late in the day.</p>
<p>So we have this trough of activity</p>
<p>and body temperature is lowest right before waking.</p>
<p>Then as we wake up, our body temperature goes up</p>
<p>and into the afternoon,</p>
<p>it continues to go up, up, up, up, up.</p>
<p>And then it tends to fall in the evening</p>
<p>and towards bedtime.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a brief blip of release of peptides</p>
<p>and other substances from the sleep centers in the brain</p>
<p>and the suprachiasmatic nucleus.</p>
<p>The sleep center is this preoptic area</p>
<p>that if you want to look that up,</p>
<p>this preoptic area, not far from the circadian clock</p>
<p>that signals the peak of alertness and wakefulness</p>
<p>about an hour before bedtime.</p>
<p>And you say, well, that&rsquo;s really weird,</p>
<p>but a lot of people get into bed,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re ready to go to sleep and they&rsquo;re wide awake</p>
<p>and they think this is an unnatural thing</p>
<p>or there&rsquo;s something wrong with them.</p>
<p>And actually it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>This, it&rsquo;s believed, I don&rsquo;t know, again,</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t consulted at the design phase,</p>
<p>but this is, it&rsquo;s believed is a signal</p>
<p>that is helpful to human beings</p>
<p>to start gathering up resources</p>
<p>and securing themselves for a night&rsquo;s sleep</p>
<p>during which we, historically,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re very vulnerable to attack from other humans</p>
<p>and from animals and so forth.</p>
<p>And so that desire to run around and clean the kitchen</p>
<p>or organize things, or just a general feeling</p>
<p>of internal anxiety late in the evening,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a natural blip that naturally passes</p>
<p>after about 45 to 60 minutes.</p>
<p>Now that&rsquo;s often the time when people start stressing</p>
<p>about the fact that they have something to do the next day</p>
<p>and they worry about not being able to sleep</p>
<p>and it can cascade into a whole set of things.</p>
<p>So another thing that I do throughout my day</p>
<p>is I know that early day I&rsquo;m going to be alert,</p>
<p>afternoon, I&rsquo;m going to be kind of sleepy.</p>
<p>And then as the evening comes around,</p>
<p>in addition to doing all the other things I&rsquo;m doing,</p>
<p>I anticipate a peak in alertness and activity</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t worry about it.</p>
<p>I use that perhaps to get organized for the next day.</p>
<p>But basically I just go through,</p>
<p>if I&rsquo;m going to do anything,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to be very mundane tasks like cleaning</p>
<p>or things that require almost zero effort.</p>
<p>And that probably speaks to my cleaning abilities too.</p>
<p>But the fact of the matter is we don&rsquo;t just go drift off</p>
<p>into sleep, there&rsquo;s this blip of alertness right before sleep</p>
<p>that I hope just cognitively knowing about</p>
<p>will be helpful to people.</p>
<p>And that raises yet another theme</p>
<p>that I think is going to be very important,</p>
<p>which is physiological mechanisms</p>
<p>like these changes in alertness or using breathing tools,</p>
<p>something we&rsquo;ll talk about in future episodes,</p>
<p>to shift our levels of autonomic arousal.</p>
<p>Those are concrete biological phenomena.</p>
<p>So is fasting.</p>
<p>Fasting will increase alertness that way.</p>
<p>So is caffeine.</p>
<p>Not everybody&rsquo;s susceptible to caffeine</p>
<p>to the same degree or others,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a physiological mechanisms.</p>
<p>We know the receptors, we know the ligands as they&rsquo;re called</p>
<p>which bind to the receptors.</p>
<p>We know the mechanisms,</p>
<p>they involve cortisol and epinephrine.</p>
<p>Those are the sorts of things</p>
<p>that I personally try and leverage</p>
<p>toward my learning and optimization of my brain</p>
<p>and my activity.</p>
<p>Doing physical activity early in the day, for instance,</p>
<p>tends to give us a longer duration wake up signal</p>
<p>and tends to accelerate waking up early in the day.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why working out late in the day</p>
<p>can sometimes cause people to have trouble falling asleep.</p>
<p>It will also phase delay you,</p>
<p>make it so that you want to wake up later the next day.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just because you&rsquo;re tired,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s because you shifted your clock</p>
<p>with activity and temperature.</p>
<p>Many people ask me about subjective tools for plasticity.</p>
<p>What about visualization?</p>
<p>You know, can we just imagine doing a particular activity?</p>
<p>Will that help us get better at that activity?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some evidence that visualization can do that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s true, but here&rsquo;s the important distinction</p>
<p>and here&rsquo;s why I personally</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t do much deliberate visualization.</p>
<p>First of all, I get my best ability</p>
<p>or achieve my best ability to visualize things</p>
<p>when I&rsquo;m in kind of a sleepy state.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why, but that&rsquo;s when I&rsquo;m able</p>
<p>to direct my brain towards internal visualization</p>
<p>with my eyes closed.</p>
<p>And generally I fall asleep and I can&rsquo;t remember anything</p>
<p>that I was thinking about before.</p>
<p>Some people, and these are work that was done</p>
<p>many years ago by Roger Shepard and by others,</p>
<p>Roger was at Stanford, but,</p>
<p>and other labs have done this too, of course,</p>
<p>of rotating objects physically in their mind</p>
<p>as a way of improving or looking at the speed</p>
<p>of spatial calculations and so forth.</p>
<p>Some people are very good at visualization.</p>
<p>They can close their eyes and they can just see objects</p>
<p>and rotate them deliberately, et cetera.</p>
<p>A lot of people, like me,</p>
<p>when we start doing that, our mind drifts too easily.</p>
<p>But I like to think I&rsquo;m a reasonably focused person</p>
<p>in the waking state.</p>
<p>So visualization has, it&rsquo;s interesting</p>
<p>because I think people are very attracted to the idea</p>
<p>that they can just think about something</p>
<p>and then get better at it that way.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s probably true if you can be very linear</p>
<p>in the way that you visualize things.</p>
<p>So I want to repeat that.</p>
<p>I think visualization does have certain power</p>
<p>if you can remain very linear and deliberate</p>
<p>and focused in the visualization.</p>
<p>But many people like myself who are challenged</p>
<p>with maintaining that linear focus with eyes closed</p>
<p>and in visualization,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t get much out of visualization.</p>
<p>And I think the data on performance really supports that.</p>
<p>Now, there are examples where, for instance,</p>
<p>people will injure one limb</p>
<p>and then they will exercise the intact limb</p>
<p>or the non-injured limb rather,</p>
<p>and they will visualize the opposite limb.</p>
<p>Sometimes there&rsquo;s even the use of mirror boxes</p>
<p>so that let&rsquo;s say my left limb is injured,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m maintaining activity with my right limb,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m using a mirror box</p>
<p>so it looks like my left limb is working well.</p>
<p>Yes, there&rsquo;s some top-down or feedback mechanisms</p>
<p>that support the idea that the injured limb</p>
<p>can rehabilitate more quickly, et cetera.</p>
<p>But those are fairly elaborate schemes.</p>
<p>These aren&rsquo;t the kinds,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have mirror boxes around my house.</p>
<p>I think these are specialized circumstances.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re a little bit like the examples</p>
<p>that we see in the news where,</p>
<p>oh, so-and-so has a stroke</p>
<p>and then spontaneously speaks a new language.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what the answer to that is.</p>
<p>It shows that the brain has associative networks</p>
<p>that are typically suppressed and those can be unleashed,</p>
<p>but you certainly don&rsquo;t want to go out</p>
<p>and give yourself a stroke deliberately</p>
<p>to try and unmask some skill</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s no concrete way to go about that</p>
<p>in a way that you could really know</p>
<p>that you were going to offset</p>
<p>the detrimental effects of the stroke.</p>
<p>In fact, I think it&rsquo;d be a terrible idea.</p>
<p>So I think what I&rsquo;m trying to describe is how a typical,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;m typical or normal.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;ve been told otherwise, it&rsquo;s certainly not normal.</p>
<p>But in terms of the way that I structure my day,</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s normal.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s pretty normal.</p>
<p>I tend to wake up right around, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>somewhere between 5.30 and 7 a.m.</p>
<p>depending on what I&rsquo;ve been doing the night before.</p>
<p>I tend to go to sleep somewhere around 10, 30, 11.</p>
<p>I tend to have one bout in the morning</p>
<p>where I can do really focused hard work</p>
<p>and I can really activate the go pathway</p>
<p>while also activating the no-go pathway</p>
<p>so that I can really stay focused, but I rely on some tools.</p>
<p>I have a period in the afternoon where I get sleepy</p>
<p>and kind of out of it, like I think most people.</p>
<p>And I tend to come out of that</p>
<p>with recognizing the opportunity</p>
<p>of that slightly sleepy state for creative work</p>
<p>and for thinking about things in novel ways.</p>
<p>I get light a couple times a day.</p>
<p>I eat low carb during the day</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t say high, but higher carb.</p>
<p>I eat starches in the evening so in a way I can sleep.</p>
<p>And then I really anticipate</p>
<p>that late afternoon peak in alertness,</p>
<p>excuse me, late night peak in alertness</p>
<p>that many people confuse for insomnia or challenges</p>
<p>when actually they&rsquo;re really quite normal</p>
<p>in their circadian cycle.</p>
<p>And then I fall asleep and if all goes well,</p>
<p>I stay asleep for four or five hours.</p>
<p>Typically it&rsquo;s three or four and then I wake up.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;m like most people,</p>
<p>I wake up during the middle of the night.</p>
<p>Now, one thing that I don&rsquo;t think has been discussed a lot</p>
<p>but one of my colleagues at the Stanford Sleep Lab tells me</p>
<p>is that every hour and a half or so, we all wake up.</p>
<p>Some of you even look around, believe it or not,</p>
<p>and go right back to sleep and you don&rsquo;t recognize it.</p>
<p>Waking up periodically during sleep is the norm.</p>
<p>It is not abnormal.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why this hasn&rsquo;t been discussed</p>
<p>more prominently.</p>
<p>I tend to wake up and if there&rsquo;s a bright light</p>
<p>coming through the blinds or if there&rsquo;s some noise upstairs,</p>
<p>if Costello&rsquo;s snoring particularly loud, I might get up,</p>
<p>I might go use the restroom, I might pick up a book</p>
<p>and read under low light or something</p>
<p>and then I generally fall back asleep and wake up.</p>
<p>Typical time for me again, 5.30 to 7 a.m. in the morning.</p>
<p>This waking up in the middle of the night thing,</p>
<p>as I mentioned at the beginning of the podcast episode today</p>
<p>is not necessarily abnormal.</p>
<p>What it probably reflects is that the real time,</p>
<p>meaning the time that I should go to sleep</p>
<p>is probably closer to eight o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<p>The word midnight was literally supposed to mean midnight.</p>
<p>Meaning all of us were meant to go to sleep</p>
<p>and wake up with the setting and arising of the sun.</p>
<p>And we know this because there&rsquo;s beautiful study</p>
<p>from University of Colorado where they took people out</p>
<p>into the wilderness to reset their circadian clocks</p>
<p>measured by way of melatonin and cortisol.</p>
<p>And they had them, they were completely out of whack</p>
<p>from interacting with screens</p>
<p>and staying up too late, et cetera.</p>
<p>And they basically had them view the sunrise</p>
<p>and view the sunset each evening.</p>
<p>And almost all of them, not all of the students,</p>
<p>but all of them got onto a schedule</p>
<p>where they naturally wanted to go to sleep at sunset</p>
<p>and wake up around sunrise or just before sunrise,</p>
<p>even when they were brought back</p>
<p>into a normal artificial light setting.</p>
<p>So I think that&rsquo;s the natural pattern</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ve just deviated from it with artificial lights.</p>
<p>So waking up at 3 a.m. or 4 a.m.</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s something screwed up about you</p>
<p>or that you have anxiety or something, although you might.</p>
<p>What it likely means is that you were supposed</p>
<p>to go to bed much earlier.</p>
<p>And because of this asymmetry</p>
<p>in the autonomic nervous system,</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s much easier for us to push</p>
<p>and to delay our sleep time</p>
<p>than it is to accelerate our wake up time.</p>
<p>In other words, it&rsquo;s easier to stay up</p>
<p>and hang out at the party,</p>
<p>even if you don&rsquo;t want to be there</p>
<p>than it is to wake up when you&rsquo;re exhausted</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re fast asleep.</p>
<p>Most people are pushing through</p>
<p>into the late hours of the evening and night</p>
<p>and going to bed much later</p>
<p>than they naturally would want to.</p>
<p>And so I personally don&rsquo;t want to go to bed at 8 p.m.</p>
<p>A lot of good things happen between 8 p.m. and 11 p.m.</p>
<p>And so I want to enjoy those</p>
<p>and I push through the evening hours.</p>
<p>But as a consequence, I&rsquo;m running out of melatonin.</p>
<p>My melatonin release is basically subsided</p>
<p>by about three or 4 a.m.</p>
<p>And so it makes sense that I would wake up.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t take melatonin</p>
<p>for reasons discussed in previous episodes.</p>
<p>I do rely on things like magnesium glycinate</p>
<p>or magnesium threonate, things like theanine.</p>
<p>Not saying any of you need to take those.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just what I happen to take</p>
<p>in order to facilitate my sleep</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s been a great benefit to me.</p>
<p>If I wake up in the middle of the night</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m anxious for whatever reason</p>
<p>and my mind is looping, I have a couple rules.</p>
<p>One is I don&rsquo;t trust anything I think about</p>
<p>when I wake up in the middle of the night, any of it.</p>
<p>Unless I&rsquo;ve had a magnificent dream</p>
<p>and I want to write it down,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll do that every once in a while.</p>
<p>Typically when I go back and read it,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not at all magnificent.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t ever remember coming up</p>
<p>with anything really fantastic in one of my dreams</p>
<p>that stuck with me or that I implemented.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really trust the kind of thinking that happens</p>
<p>in those wee hours of the circadian cycle for me.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just nothing either for me,</p>
<p>terribly creative or worth linear implementation</p>
<p>at that time.</p>
<p>But one thing that has been very helpful</p>
<p>is to sometimes do one of these</p>
<p>non-sleep deep rest protocols</p>
<p>as a way to go back into sleep.</p>
<p>So a hypnosis app or some of the scripts</p>
<p>by Michael Seeley that I&rsquo;ve mentioned before</p>
<p>or the Reverie Health or a Yoga Nidra protocol.</p>
<p>Those for me have been very useful</p>
<p>at helping me turn off kind of looping thinking</p>
<p>in the middle of the night and fall back asleep.</p>
<p>In reviewing my schedule for you,</p>
<p>just as a context for how to implement</p>
<p>certain types of tools for optimizing learning,</p>
<p>realize that it gives the impression</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a 90 minute bout of learning and work</p>
<p>in the morning and then a 90 minute bout</p>
<p>of creative type work in the afternoon and that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>There are a lot of hours in between, of course,</p>
<p>and I just want to be very clear.</p>
<p>Those hours for me are occupied by pretty,</p>
<p>not mundane tasks, but things that are kind of random.</p>
<p>Those are things like email or attending to Zoom meetings</p>
<p>or meeting with colleagues and students</p>
<p>and things of that sort.</p>
<p>I sometimes will read just for sake of my own enrichment.</p>
<p>I mentioned those two 90 minute bouts</p>
<p>because those are the two 90 minute bouts</p>
<p>where I&rsquo;m trying to expand on the mental capacities</p>
<p>that I already have.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re really where I&rsquo;m trying to stretch</p>
<p>and grow what I&rsquo;m able to do</p>
<p>on a regular basis reflexively.</p>
<p>So I want to emphasize that.</p>
<p>The whole day doesn&rsquo;t just consist</p>
<p>of those two 90 minute bouts.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not the way my schedule works</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s not the way my lifestyle is arranged,</p>
<p>which is fortunate because I enjoy</p>
<p>all those other things as well.</p>
<p>And so for many of you out there who are in school</p>
<p>or have family demands or other demands,</p>
<p>the key is to slot in those brain optimization segments</p>
<p>of about 90 minutes, one or two, or maybe more per day.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re trying to slot those in wherever you can</p>
<p>amidst your other obligations</p>
<p>and things that you need to do.</p>
<p>But you want to do that in an intelligent way</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s anchored to your biology.</p>
<p>And then you want to do a number of things</p>
<p>which I&rsquo;ve talked about today</p>
<p>in order to optimize those sessions</p>
<p>to get the most out of them.</p>
<p>So as we round up, I acknowledge that once again,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve covered a huge range of topics</p>
<p>related to how to optimize learning and brain change</p>
<p>and essentially mental performance.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve set that in the context</p>
<p>of some biological mechanism like the basal ganglia,</p>
<p>go-no-go pathways, the circadian autonomic system,</p>
<p>and some of the relationship between food and fasting</p>
<p>and particular types of food in alertness or sleepiness,</p>
<p>how linear focus and strategy implementation</p>
<p>is best served by high alert states, although not too alert,</p>
<p>and how creative states,</p>
<p>at least the first phase of creativity,</p>
<p>which is the creative arrangement kind of brainstorming stage</p>
<p>is supported by states of kind of relaxation</p>
<p>or even slightly sleepy,</p>
<p>but the creative implementation is a very linear</p>
<p>and focused and deliberate process,</p>
<p>much like the highly focused state that I described.</p>
<p>I described how I do these things</p>
<p>just to give you a context.</p>
<p>A lot of you asked for what I do</p>
<p>in order to set it within a context,</p>
<p>but by no means are these rigid times</p>
<p>and ways of doing things.</p>
<p>But I think it&rsquo;s fair to say</p>
<p>that what I do has a circadian logic.</p>
<p>It also has grounding in biological mechanisms.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re very concrete,</p>
<p>that we know the cells and mechanisms and neurotransmitters.</p>
<p>And then some of them are a little bit headed out</p>
<p>into what we would call kind of emerging</p>
<p>or I don&rsquo;t want to say cutting edge,</p>
<p>but maybe a front edge of what neuroscience</p>
<p>is starting to understand about creativity and so forth.</p>
<p>Those are areas that are just now coming to some clarity,</p>
<p>and there certainly is still a lot more work to do.</p>
<p>A lot of different ways to arrange one&rsquo;s routine,</p>
<p>but hopefully the tools and practices I described</p>
<p>will be useful to you.</p>
<p>I want to mention that a lot of people ask me</p>
<p>about specific tools and practices.</p>
<p>They asked me about Wim Hof breathing, about ice baths.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked a little bit about ice baths before,</p>
<p>I think in cold exposure,</p>
<p>about binaural beats and things of those sort.</p>
<p>I think the way to look at any tool</p>
<p>to modulate or measure the nervous system</p>
<p>is ask whether or not it&rsquo;s going to move you up</p>
<p>or down the state of autonomic arousal,</p>
<p>whether or not it&rsquo;s going to make you more alert</p>
<p>or more calm, more focused or less focused.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s kind of the two axes here</p>
<p>is that we need to think about.</p>
<p>Sometimes you want to be more alert than you are,</p>
<p>and indeed things like cold showers, ice baths,</p>
<p>super oxygenation, Wim Hof type breathing</p>
<p>will bring your level of alertness up.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some cautionary notes</p>
<p>associated with each of those.</p>
<p>You need to read and understand those cautionary notes</p>
<p>for yourself, everybody&rsquo;s different.</p>
<p>And some of those carry certain dangers</p>
<p>under certain conditions.</p>
<p>Others have huge margins for safety.</p>
<p>An ice bath generally wakes you up.</p>
<p>A warmer hot bath generally calms you down, right?</p>
<p>Binaural beats, there aren&rsquo;t a lot of data</p>
<p>in quality peer-reviewed journals.</p>
<p>I did put in the effort to go search it out.</p>
<p>There are a few.</p>
<p>Binaural beats are listening to frequencies of sound</p>
<p>that slightly differ or offset for the two ears.</p>
<p>It has been shown can shift the brain</p>
<p>into particular states.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll notice today,</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t really talk about alpha or theta or gamma rhythms.</p>
<p>I personally, in reviewing the literature,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s fair to say</p>
<p>that alpha states are great for X</p>
<p>and theta states are great for Y.</p>
<p>And besides, most of us aren&rsquo;t walking around our homes</p>
<p>and our workplaces geared up to EEG machines</p>
<p>or with wires down below our skull,</p>
<p>so we don&rsquo;t know when we&rsquo;re in those states anyway.</p>
<p>I think the subjective reading of whether or not one</p>
<p>is alert or calm,</p>
<p>and whether or not that alertness or calmness</p>
<p>matches the goal or the thing</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re trying to achieve in terms of learning,</p>
<p>including sleep,</p>
<p>is the most valuable internal tool</p>
<p>and recognition that we can all have.</p>
<p>In other words, if I want to be very alert</p>
<p>and I need to be very alert and I&rsquo;m exhausted,</p>
<p>there might be tools that I should use to wake up.</p>
<p>It might also speak to the fact</p>
<p>that I might not have slept as well as I could have</p>
<p>or should have the night before.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s really about a match</p>
<p>between where we are on that autonomic arousal scale</p>
<p>and what we&rsquo;re trying to achieve.</p>
<p>And indeed, there are going to be a lot of tools,</p>
<p>including supplements and other prescription drugs</p>
<p>and things that can help move us</p>
<p>along that autonomic continuum</p>
<p>up toward more alertness or toward more calmness.</p>
<p>But ultimately, it&rsquo;s about tailoring that alertness</p>
<p>and calmness to the specific types of learning</p>
<p>and activities that you are going to do and perform.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s reciprocal,</p>
<p>meaning some of those activities,</p>
<p>like exercise early in the day,</p>
<p>will increase your level of autonomic arousal</p>
<p>and alertness.</p>
<p>Certain foods will tend to wake you up.</p>
<p>Certain foods will tend to make you more sleepy.</p>
<p>And the volume of food and the timing of food</p>
<p>is a factor also.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a huge parameter space.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a huge set of variables.</p>
<p>The impacts, whether or not we&rsquo;re feeling well,</p>
<p>performing well, learning great, or not learning great.</p>
<p>And the key thing is to become an observer</p>
<p>of your own system and what works for you.</p>
<p>And to recognize that there are two bins of tools</p>
<p>for optimizing learning and brain performance.</p>
<p>One are tools that are really anchored</p>
<p>in biological mechanism.</p>
<p>And we are certain of what those are.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked about some of those.</p>
<p>The other, the more subjective tools.</p>
<p>For some of you,</p>
<p>visualization might work terrifically well.</p>
<p>For some of you, one song might really wake you up</p>
<p>because of the associations you have with it.</p>
<p>And for me, I might just, you know,</p>
<p>it might repel me from the room</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t like it, or it might put me to sleep.</p>
<p>But of course, volume is kind of a universal.</p>
<p>Loud music tends to wake people up.</p>
<p>Soft music doesn&rsquo;t tend to wake them up quite as much.</p>
<p>So part of today is really getting you to think about</p>
<p>in a scientific way, in a structured way,</p>
<p>about the non-negotiable elements,</p>
<p>which are that you&rsquo;re going to have a period</p>
<p>of every 24-hour cycle when you tend to be more awake</p>
<p>and a period when you tend to be more asleep</p>
<p>and how to leverage those</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re not fighting an uphill battle</p>
<p>to wake up when you actually would want to be</p>
<p>and should be sleepy and not trying to go to sleep</p>
<p>when you are naturally, you know, going to be most awake.</p>
<p>So a lot of it is really anchors back</p>
<p>to those core mechanisms of biology.</p>
<p>And then you start layering on the different protocols</p>
<p>of food and supplementation, et cetera.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s important to recognize</p>
<p>that some people are just more go, go, go, go, go,</p>
<p>and no go.</p>
<p>And some people are just calmer</p>
<p>and have a harder time getting into action in an activity.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just the way that we&rsquo;re wired.</p>
<p>Some of us have autonomic nervous systems</p>
<p>that are more geared towards parasympathetic calm states.</p>
<p>One of the reasons I love bulldogs, not just my bulldog,</p>
<p>is that they are very calm animals.</p>
<p>In fact, they make no spontaneous movements</p>
<p>unless there&rsquo;s something to respond to.</p>
<p>And I find that incredibly relaxing.</p>
<p>Other animals like pit bulls,</p>
<p>who I also really like and enjoy, and other species,</p>
<p>their tail&rsquo;s always wagging</p>
<p>and that they&rsquo;re always in a position</p>
<p>to make a movement at any second</p>
<p>because they tend to ride</p>
<p>at pretty high levels of autonomic arousal.</p>
<p>They pop up really quickly</p>
<p>when you say it&rsquo;s time to go for a walk.</p>
<p>Costello does it one limb at a time,</p>
<p>and sometimes he just goes back to sleep.</p>
<p>And so there are people like that too.</p>
<p>And so you have to know where you are</p>
<p>and what particular goals you&rsquo;re trying to pursue.</p>
<p>As a final closure to this,</p>
<p>I want to emphasize that today, as always,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve strived to be accurate.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure if I made mistakes, some of you will point it out,</p>
<p>and I appreciate that, and I&rsquo;ll post a correction</p>
<p>if we agree that I indeed misspoke or miscited something,</p>
<p>but by no means was I exhaustive.</p>
<p>I mean, I might&rsquo;ve exhausted some of you,</p>
<p>but the information wasn&rsquo;t exhaustive,</p>
<p>meaning there&rsquo;s no way that I could cover</p>
<p>all the ways in which we optimize</p>
<p>or can optimize learning and performance.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;ve touched on a number of them</p>
<p>that I hope that you&rsquo;ll find value in</p>
<p>and that you&rsquo;ll explore in your own lives.</p>
<p>We are continuing with this theme</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s what we do for this podcast.</p>
<p>We stay on one theme for an entire month.</p>
<p>For the next episode, we&rsquo;re going to explore</p>
<p>two very essential aspects of neuroplasticity</p>
<p>that actually relate to learning,</p>
<p>which are pain, pain management, and neural regeneration.</p>
<p>And for those of you that don&rsquo;t have injuries</p>
<p>or don&rsquo;t suffer from chronic pain,</p>
<p>the discussion is still going to be a very important one</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not just going to be about pain</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re trying to get rid of.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also going to be about how certain sensory experiences</p>
<p>within the pain network can become amplified,</p>
<p>as well as how we can use top-down modulation.</p>
<p>We can use our mind to suppress the pain response.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re also going to talk about</p>
<p>some of the hardwired mechanisms that are bottom-up</p>
<p>that exist in our periphery, in our body, to control pain.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re also going to discuss</p>
<p>a number of interesting interactions</p>
<p>between the pain system and the learning system.</p>
<p>So again, if you&rsquo;re not interested in pain per se,</p>
<p>it still is going to be a very valid conversation</p>
<p>for sake of understanding how to optimize brain performance.</p>
<p>And neural regeneration goes hand-in-hand</p>
<p>with that discussion.</p>
<p>So I hope you&rsquo;ll join us for that.</p>
<p>I suppose I&rsquo;d be remiss if I didn&rsquo;t mention</p>
<p>that Costello has been snoring extremely loudly today.</p>
<p>He had a good long walk this morning,</p>
<p>which means up the driveway, down the driveway.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s an old dog.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;ve been hearing him in the background</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s been distracting, now you know why.</p>
<p>It probably relates to where you were</p>
<p>on your level of autonomic arousal.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll leave it to you to answer</p>
<p>that question for yourself.</p>
<p>Many of you continue to graciously ask</p>
<p>how you can help support the podcast.</p>
<p>And we really appreciate the question.</p>
<p>The best way is to subscribe wherever it is</p>
<p>you happen to be listening or watching.</p>
<p>So for those of you that it&rsquo;s YouTube,</p>
<p>please subscribe to the YouTube channel.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s Apple, subscribe to the podcast on Apple.</p>
<p>Or if it&rsquo;s Spotify, subscribe there.</p>
<p>Maybe you subscribe to all three.</p>
<p>If you have comments and feedback for us,</p>
<p>suggestions for future podcast episodes or topics to cover,</p>
<p>please place those in the comment section on YouTube.</p>
<p>Apple also provides a section</p>
<p>where you can give us a rating.</p>
<p>We would love it if you give us a five-star rating</p>
<p>or whatever it is that you feel that we deserve.</p>
<p>And in general, if you could tell people about the podcast,</p>
<p>we hope that you would tell them</p>
<p>because you think the information</p>
<p>would be of use to them, of course.</p>
<p>Tell your friends, tell your family, tell your coworkers,</p>
<p>because as we expand the podcast,</p>
<p>the support for the podcast just grows along with it.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a terrific way to support us.</p>
<p>As always, check out our sponsors,</p>
<p>which were mentioned at the beginning.</p>
<p>And as mentioned at the beginning of today&rsquo;s episode,</p>
<p>we are now partnered with Momentus Supplements</p>
<p>because they make single ingredient formulations</p>
<p>that are of the absolute highest quality</p>
<p>and they ship international.</p>
<p>If you go to livemomentus.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>you will find many of the supplements</p>
<p>that have been discussed on various episodes</p>
<p>of the Huberman Lab podcast.</p>
<p>And you will find various protocols</p>
<p>related to those supplements.</p>
<p>Last but not least, on behalf of me and Costello,</p>
<p>I want to thank you for your time and attention today.</p>
<p>And as always, thank you for your interest in science.</p>
