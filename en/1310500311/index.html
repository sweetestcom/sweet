    <p>The following is a conversation with Brian Armstrong,</p>
<p>cofounder and CEO of Coinbase,</p>
<p>the largest cryptocurrency exchange platform</p>
<p>with 98 million users in 100 countries,</p>
<p>listing Bitcoin, Ethereum, Cardano,</p>
<p>and over 100 popular cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>I recorded this conversation with Brian</p>
<p>before this week&rsquo;s SEC probe</p>
<p>into whether some of the crypto listings are securities</p>
<p>and thus need to be regulated as such.</p>
<p>As always, with conversations that involve cryptocurrency,</p>
<p>I try to make it timeless</p>
<p>so that the price soaring high or crashing down low</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t distract from the fundamental technological,</p>
<p>economic, social, and philosophical ideas</p>
<p>underlying this new form of money, energy, and information.</p>
<p>Our world runs on money, the exchange and store of value,</p>
<p>and cryptocurrency seeks to build the next chapter</p>
<p>of how money works and what it can do.</p>
<p>Coinbase and Brian are trying to do this</p>
<p>by working together with regulators and governments,</p>
<p>which is a long and difficult road.</p>
<p>Bureaucracies resist change, for better and for worse.</p>
<p>The latest SEC probe is a good representation of this.</p>
<p>It is a serious attempt to limit fraud,</p>
<p>but one that also runs the risk of limiting innovation</p>
<p>and limiting financial freedom of individuals.</p>
<p>This is a complicated mess,</p>
<p>and I applaud everyone involved</p>
<p>for trying to work through it.</p>
<p>I hope in the end, the interest of the individual wins.</p>
<p>Decentralization, after all, is a hedge</p>
<p>against the corrupting nature of centralized power.</p>
<p>This is the Lex Friedman podcast.</p>

<p>And now, dear friends, here&rsquo;s Brian Armstrong.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with the fact that you&rsquo;re a programmer.</p>
<p>What was the first program you&rsquo;ve ever written?</p>
<p>Or the first one that you remember?</p>
<p>The first memory I have of programming</p>
<p>was probably in middle school.</p>
<p>And I remember it was recess,</p>
<p>and they had this time period where you could read books,</p>
<p>and the other kids were reading comic books and stuff.</p>
<p>And for some reason, I had gotten into this idea</p>
<p>that I wanted to get into computers,</p>
<p>and I was playing with computers at home.</p>
<p>And so I got this book, I think from the library,</p>
<p>it was called How to Learn Java in 30 Days.</p>
<p>So I was reading this book at the recess,</p>
<p>and I didn&rsquo;t understand anything.</p>
<p>And I remember I went home,</p>
<p>and I tried to get this thing working.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;ve ever written a Java program,</p>
<p>the first lines are public static void main string args</p>
<p>or whatever.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s so foreign, and it&rsquo;s so difficult to get started.</p>
<p>And so I was kind of frustrated.</p>
<p>I was like, I don&rsquo;t understand anything</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s happening in this book.</p>
<p>So the first thing I wrote was probably just</p>
<p>a Hello World app in Java.</p>
<p>But I felt like I was so confused</p>
<p>about what was actually happening</p>
<p>that I later learned a bit of PHP.</p>
<p>And PHP was like more fun for me</p>
<p>because it was like, oh, just print out what you want.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t have all this complexity around it.</p>
<p>So then I got more into PHP,</p>
<p>I started building like some simple websites,</p>
<p>I think learned some HTML.</p>
<p>So I think that was my introduction to programming,</p>
<p>at least the very beginning part.</p>
<p>Yeah, you know, Java has a lot of,</p>
<p>out of all the Hello Worlds it could possibly write,</p>
<p>Java is the one where I think it&rsquo;s the longest.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Which is quite interesting</p>
<p>because Java is often at least for a long time</p>
<p>was used as the primary programming language</p>
<p>to teach people how to program,</p>
<p>or at least about object oriented programming.</p>
<p>I think most universities have now switched</p>
<p>and high school switched to Python.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if that&rsquo;s the case.</p>
<p>Probably better.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easier to learn.</p>
<p>It lowers the, it makes it less scary.</p>
<p>It was like less of a hurdle.</p>
<p>And certainly none of them use PHP.</p>
<p>I love PHP and I feel like it&rsquo;s a dirty secret.</p>
<p>I have to keep private to myself.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s somebody I&rsquo;m seeing on the side</p>
<p>or something like that,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s just not a respected programming language</p>
<p>because I think there&rsquo;s so many ways</p>
<p>you can write poor code with PHP,</p>
<p>which is why it&rsquo;s not respected.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s a scripting language more so,</p>
<p>although of course Facebook built like a huge stack</p>
<p>on top of an invaluable company,</p>
<p>but I still love Ruby to this day.</p>
<p>Ruby is probably my favorite language.</p>
<p>Python&rsquo;s great too,</p>
<p>but I just love the idea behind Ruby that it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s make it easier for the human,</p>
<p>harder for the computer,</p>
<p>and make it a joy to be expressive and all these things.</p>
<p>So I was never the best computer scientist,</p>
<p>but I was a good hacker.</p>
<p>I could rapidly prototype products</p>
<p>and using languages like Ruby.</p>
<p>Do a lot of computer science programs still use like Lisp</p>
<p>and Scheme and things like that?</p>
<p>No, they do for, that&rsquo;s like, that&rsquo;s if you&rsquo;re hardcore.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re legit, you&rsquo;re gonna do</p>
<p>some of the functional languages.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a few others that popped up,</p>
<p>but Lisp is a distant memory for a lot of people.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like somebody has to like,</p>
<p>you go to library, you dust off the book,</p>
<p>but Scheme a little bit.</p>
<p>I think if you&rsquo;re starting,</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s courses about languages themselves,</p>
<p>like programming languages.</p>
<p>Lisp might be one of those,</p>
<p>you know how there&rsquo;s languages that nobody uses anymore,</p>
<p>like ancient languages?</p>
<p>You might have to go to school in that same way</p>
<p>for programming languages.</p>
<p>Back in the day, we used to use parentheses.</p>
<p>I of course still use Emacs as the editor</p>
<p>for most things that I do.</p>
<p>And Emacs is, a lot of the customization you can do</p>
<p>is in Lisp and that&rsquo;s the language probably</p>
<p>when I first really fell in love with programming is Lisp.</p>
<p>Because for a long time throughout the earlier history</p>
<p>of artificial intelligence,</p>
<p>Lisp was the primary language,</p>
<p>but it still had a life in the 90s and the aughts</p>
<p>where some people would use it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s such a beautiful functional language,</p>
<p>but it just somehow didn&rsquo;t pick up.</p>
<p>That said, I should say sort of push back,</p>
<p>PHP, I feel like it&rsquo;s still true</p>
<p>that most of the web runs on PHP.</p>
<p>Most of the backend is still PHP.</p>
<p>So if you look at, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like the stuff that people don&rsquo;t talk about.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like what runs most systems in the world?</p>
<p>What runs the most backend?</p>
<p>What runs most front end?</p>
<p>JavaScript, you know, HTML.</p>
<p>The Stack Exchange surveys show JavaScript</p>
<p>is the most popular language in the world, I think, right?</p>
<p>Oh yeah, in terms of programmers and numbers of, I wonder.</p>
<p>By survey of number of programmers on Stack Overflow.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, but that&rsquo;s also the cutting edge, right?</p>
<p>Those are the people that are just like excitedly</p>
<p>writing code.</p>
<p>I wonder if there&rsquo;s people that are just like</p>
<p>maintaining gigantic code bases.</p>
<p>Yeah, I feel like the amount of Java out there</p>
<p>just running industrial systems has gotta be enormous.</p>
<p>And then of course in the banking industry, finance,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like even older stuff, Cobalt and whatnot, but.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been actually looking for somebody to interview</p>
<p>who represents Cobalt and Fortran.</p>
<p>Like who&rsquo;s the figure still there that holds the flag?</p>
<p>I did, you know, with Java, founder of Java,</p>
<p>creator of Java, creator of Python, creator of C++,</p>
<p>but nobody wants to hold the flag for Cobalt and Fortran,</p>
<p>even though some of the most important systems in the world</p>
<p>still run on those.</p>
<p>Like power systems and infrastructure systems,</p>
<p>which is fascinating, and ATMs and stuff like that.</p>
<p>Like a lot of stuff that we rely on,</p>
<p>it just works, and the reason we don&rsquo;t change it</p>
<p>is because it works well.</p>
<p>It was written in languages that people don&rsquo;t use anymore.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;d be a cool series of interviews.</p>
<p>Get the stuff that&rsquo;s like tech that was invented</p>
<p>40, 50 years ago, but still is being used widely.</p>
<p>I mean Emacs is an example of that.</p>
<p>Let me ask the big question of</p>
<p>what are cryptocurrency exchanges and what&rsquo;s Coinbase?</p>
<p>How does it work?</p>
<p>Before, I&rsquo;ll ask even bigger questions,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s just a nice kind of palate cleansing question</p>
<p>of what is Coinbase?</p>
<p>Coinbase is a cryptocurrency exchange brokerage custodian.</p>
<p>Basically, we&rsquo;re the primary financial account for people</p>
<p>in the crypto economy, how they buy crypto,</p>
<p>how they store it, how they use it increasingly</p>
<p>in different ways.</p>
<p>We can talk about that.</p>
<p>So yeah, we want to be the way that a billion people</p>
<p>hopefully access the open financial system globally.</p>
<p>How does it work?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s cryptocurrency?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s Bitcoin, there&rsquo;s Ethereum.</p>
<p>What does it mean to be an exchange?</p>
<p>What does it mean to store?</p>
<p>What does it mean to transact?</p>
<p>How does it, what does Coinbase actually do?</p>
<p>Okay, so basically in any given market,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some people who want to buy,</p>
<p>some people who want to sell,</p>
<p>and you keep an order book of all those prices.</p>
<p>And then if someone&rsquo;s willing to buy</p>
<p>for more than the lowest price someone&rsquo;s willing to sell,</p>
<p>then you get a trade to execute.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s kind of how an exchange works underneath.</p>
<p>And a brokerage is kind of simpler than that even.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to know,</p>
<p>look at the whole order book and everything,</p>
<p>but you just go in there and you say,</p>
<p>I want to buy a hundred dollars of Bitcoin</p>
<p>or whatever cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>You get a quote, and if you like it, you can hit accept.</p>
<p>And the core things that we do to make all that</p>
<p>kind of just work, make it seamless,</p>
<p>it sounds simple on the surface,</p>
<p>is we have to do payment integrations</p>
<p>in a variety of places around the world</p>
<p>to make it easy for people to get fiat currency</p>
<p>into this ecosystem.</p>
<p>We have to do work on cybersecurity a lot.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s lots of hackers out there</p>
<p>trying to break into our systems and steal crypto</p>
<p>or to put stolen credit cards and bank accounts</p>
<p>and things like that into these systems.</p>
<p>We have to integrate with the blockchains themselves,</p>
<p>which are periodically getting updated</p>
<p>and having various airdrops and all kinds of things.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re integrated with lots of different blockchains.</p>
<p>And then we have to store the crypto</p>
<p>that people buy securely as well.</p>
<p>So crypto is kind of like storing,</p>
<p>you store the private keys essentially.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve invented a lot of cool technology</p>
<p>about how to do that securely</p>
<p>that helps me sleep at night</p>
<p>as one of the largest crypto custodians out there.</p>
<p>So those are some of the pieces that had to come together</p>
<p>to get that early simple buy sell experience to work.</p>
<p>And yeah, I mean, Coinbase actually has</p>
<p>a lot of different products now.</p>
<p>So we have like an institutional product.</p>
<p>We have Coinbase Commerce,</p>
<p>which is like merchant payments, like Stripe for crypto.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got a self custodial wallet,</p>
<p>which we can talk about.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s all kinds of cool applications</p>
<p>people are building with web3</p>
<p>and they can access it through that.</p>
<p>We just launched an NFT product.</p>
<p>I can go on down the list.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re sort of like a portfolio of crypto products now.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re big enough where we can do multiple things.</p>
<p>But yeah, the core thing we got started with</p>
<p>and still the majority of our revenue today</p>
<p>is people just wanna come in and buy and sell some crypto.</p>
<p>And we help them do that and make it simple</p>
<p>and easy to use.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll ask you about wallet, NFT is about,</p>
<p>what is it called?</p>
<p>The Stripe type?</p>
<p>Coinbase Commerce.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll ask you about all that.</p>
<p>But order books in exchange,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the difference between that and stocks, for example,</p>
<p>which there&rsquo;s also order books.</p>
<p>Yes, I mean, stocks trade through order books too.</p>
<p>So do commodities.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s all similar type of situation.</p>
<p>So when I wanna buy one Bitcoin and I see Coinbase,</p>
<p>say the price of that Bitcoin is say $40,000</p>
<p>and I press buy, what happens?</p>
<p>Yeah, okay.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve gotten a lot,</p>
<p>when you press the button on your keyboard,</p>
<p>like an electrical signal goes up the wire</p>
<p>on your keyboard.</p>
<p>No, we won&rsquo;t cut out the level.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s also important, the timing, right?</p>
<p>Cause it&rsquo;s not price fixed.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s giving you a quote, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a whole concept of like slippage.</p>
<p>And like by the time the quote is executed,</p>
<p>if the price has moved too much, like we may reject it.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s various things like that.</p>
<p>But how do, I mean, what&rsquo;s the simple version I can give you?</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ll basically check the order book, give you a quote.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s good for some period of time</p>
<p>or for some amount of slippage.</p>
<p>And then what&rsquo;s happening is we&rsquo;re initiating a debit</p>
<p>to your payment method, whether that&rsquo;s a credit card</p>
<p>or a bank account, or you&rsquo;re storing dollars or euros</p>
<p>or something on our platform,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s various payment methods.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re basically debiting that.</p>
<p>And then we&rsquo;re crediting you the crypto</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re taking a fee for it too.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s fundamentally what&rsquo;s happening underneath.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s just some interesting slippage.</p>
<p>How do you calculate how much slippage is allowed?</p>
<p>Like how do you know these things?</p>
<p>Cause order books are fascinating.</p>
<p>The dynamics of that is pretty interesting.</p>
<p>The little I know about it.</p>
<p>Yeah, so there&rsquo;s a lot of people like traders</p>
<p>who get super into this and like high frequency traders</p>
<p>and arbitrage and all kinds of interesting topics.</p>
<p>Flash Boys was like an interesting book</p>
<p>on this whole thing.</p>
<p>You want like access to information the fastest,</p>
<p>sometimes even putting your thing in the data center</p>
<p>right next to the thing.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t allow that colo stuff</p>
<p>cause we want it to be more democratized.</p>
<p>But basically you give a,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say we wanted to just keep it math simple.</p>
<p>We want to charge a 1% fee.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re buying $100 of Bitcoin</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll charge you $101,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve presented you the amount of Bitcoin</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to get for the $100.</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s say 10 seconds later you hit accept.</p>
<p>We go to fill the order.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s going to be some error bound</p>
<p>around that 1% fee, right?</p>
<p>And if we think we&rsquo;re actually losing money on the trade,</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;ll often reject it.</p>
<p>So some part of the fee,</p>
<p>the slippage is incorporated into that,</p>
<p>averaged over a large number of people.</p>
<p>Just, it&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>Cause like even just like that little detail</p>
<p>probably requires a lot of experimentation.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s kind of like a giant bug bounty out there</p>
<p>because if you get it wrong,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s people who are going to arbitrage that.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve had people sort of pen test our systems</p>
<p>in a really creative ways where like,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll just fire like programmatically with APIs,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll fire off like a million different quotes</p>
<p>and look for one of them that&rsquo;s out of bounds</p>
<p>and then actually take that money right there.</p>
<p>And we get people doing all kinds of crazy stuff.</p>
<p>So how do you protect against that?</p>
<p>How do you protect?</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ll talk about cybersecurity in interesting ways,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a lot of clever people</p>
<p>trying to do clever things to earn,</p>
<p>not even just to break into the system,</p>
<p>but to earn an edge of some kind in the system.</p>
<p>How do you stay one step ahead?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no silver bullet,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a bunch of lead bullets, right?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like, you know, one thing we do is</p>
<p>we just have good test suites, right?</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re testing every piece of code that goes out,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like just common good best practice,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s particularly important in financial services.</p>
<p>Another thing we do is we hire third party firms</p>
<p>to try to audit this stuff and break in.</p>
<p>Another one we do is we have a bug bounty program.</p>
<p>So we basically pay white hat hackers to find this stuff</p>
<p>before the black hats do.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve paid out lots of good bug bounties.</p>
<p>So, you know, try all the above.</p>
<p>And occasionally you don&rsquo;t get it right</p>
<p>and you lose some money and then you fix it</p>
<p>and you keep going, so yeah.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about cybersecurity a little bit more.</p>
<p>You mentioned using stolen bank accounts.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s another one, that&rsquo;s another interesting one.</p>
<p>How do you protect against that?</p>
<p>Okay, so fraud prevention, yeah, is a big topic.</p>
<p>So one of the, there&rsquo;s a lot of things people do,</p>
<p>but one of the things they do</p>
<p>is that you use machine learning, right?</p>
<p>So you look at hundreds.</p>
<p>To protect or to attack?</p>
<p>To protect against it.</p>
<p>So what you want to do is kind of build up</p>
<p>a labeled data set of all the different people</p>
<p>who have turned out to be fraudulent and good actors,</p>
<p>and hopefully collect as much data as you can.</p>
<p>And then, you know, you might feed hundreds</p>
<p>or thousands of these factors</p>
<p>into your machine learning model</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;ll come back with a risk score.</p>
<p>So, you know, an example of like the kinds of factors</p>
<p>people create or put in there, you know,</p>
<p>obviously I don&rsquo;t want to disclose too many of them</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a cat and mouse game,</p>
<p>but just kind of, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>relatively well known stuff might be.</p>
<p>You know, you have device fingerprints, right?</p>
<p>So like, what kind of device are you on</p>
<p>and what fonts do you have installed?</p>
<p>A lot of people who are farming lots of these accounts,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re using emulators and like virtual machines and stuff.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not like, you know,</p>
<p>an average person on that device.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;ll see sometimes like,</p>
<p>one of my favorite metrics we track for this</p>
<p>was called like improbable travel velocity.</p>
<p>So we would, we&rsquo;re tracking people&rsquo;s IPS, right?</p>
<p>And you might see someone who was one day in Austin, Texas</p>
<p>and then like an hour later they were in London or something.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, well, that&rsquo;s very improbable.</p>
<p>I mean, sometimes people are using VPNs.</p>
<p>So you gotta be careful with that</p>
<p>because like there&rsquo;s legitimate people who use VPNs too.</p>
<p>But if it&rsquo;s not possible for them to have gotten on a plane</p>
<p>and gotten there that quickly,</p>
<p>then that&rsquo;s usually they&rsquo;re like spoofing a device or IP.</p>
<p>Sometimes those are interesting factors.</p>
<p>But yeah, if you feed enough of these in, you will,</p>
<p>oh, another fun one is like, you know,</p>
<p>real users will type their credit card</p>
<p>like one number at a time.</p>
<p>Scammers have a list of them</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll just paste in a whole number.</p>
<p>So you can look at like the number of milliseconds</p>
<p>between keystrokes.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s all kinds of stuff people have come up with.</p>
<p>And even for travel velocity,</p>
<p>you could probably incorporate VPNs too</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s probably a travel velocity</p>
<p>for VPN switching too that&rsquo;s human like.</p>
<p>Like if you&rsquo;re using legitimately VPN for something else,</p>
<p>that might be, there&rsquo;s like legitimate uses too.</p>
<p>Actually, you know, I feel embarrassed</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t know this, probably should.</p>
<p>But the, I&rsquo;m not a robot.</p>
<p>Capture thing. Capture thing.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So that probably works in the same way.</p>
<p>Like how do you move your mouse maybe</p>
<p>or how the dynamics of the clicking.</p>
<p>Totally.</p>
<p>But how does that even work that well then?</p>
<p>And why can&rsquo;t it be fake?</p>
<p>I need to look into this.</p>
<p>Cause it&rsquo;s such a trivial capture.</p>
<p>It feels like it should be very crackable.</p>
<p>And yet a lot of high security places use that.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really interesting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s another cat and mouse game.</p>
<p>So I think they&rsquo;ve, yeah,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s using a lot of similar signals</p>
<p>like mouse movements, keystrokes.</p>
<p>And then obviously all the stuff that comes over</p>
<p>the wire with your browser.</p>
<p>So like what operating system, what fonts,</p>
<p>what headers are being sent over.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s actually, there&rsquo;s an old website.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t remember what it&rsquo;s called.</p>
<p>It was kind of like Panoptik Click</p>
<p>or Panopticon or something.</p>
<p>But it basically was like a proof of concept site</p>
<p>that they would just show you all the data</p>
<p>that was kind of getting sent over with your request.</p>
<p>And like say that there&rsquo;s only one person in the world</p>
<p>who has this exact set of data.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s you.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s almost like a workaround,</p>
<p>a clever workaround to track somebody,</p>
<p>make identify a unique person,</p>
<p>even if like there wasn&rsquo;t a cookie involved or something.</p>
<p>Yeah, this is a fascinating world</p>
<p>where you can&rsquo;t see anybody here in the dark</p>
<p>and yet you have a lot of signal</p>
<p>and you have to figure out who&rsquo;s a real person, who&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s a robot, who&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>Let me step back.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna jump around all over the place.</p>
<p>Let me step back.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I like your interviews.</p>
<p>You get into like technical topics.</p>
<p>So just let&rsquo;s use Bitcoin as a measure of time.</p>
<p>You started Coinbase when Bitcoin was $10.</p>
<p>And you just mentioned an incredible system</p>
<p>with security, with transactions.</p>
<p>Everything is thought through.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot going on.</p>
<p>But what was version one back in those early days,</p>
<p>the first prototype of Coinbase?</p>
<p>What did that look like?</p>
<p>Like what did it take to write it,</p>
<p>to think through it and make it work enough</p>
<p>to at least make you believe that it&rsquo;s gonna work?</p>
<p>Well, I definitely didn&rsquo;t know if it was gonna work.</p>
<p>I mean, it was kind of,</p>
<p>I felt like I was just following my gut.</p>
<p>So, I mean, I was working at Airbnb.</p>
<p>I was a software engineer there, project manager.</p>
<p>I was working on some fraud prevention stuff, for instance.</p>
<p>And I read the Bitcoin white paper</p>
<p>in kind of December of 2010.</p>
<p>I started going to some Bitcoin meetups in the Bay Area,</p>
<p>met lots of interesting people there,</p>
<p>like crazy people, anarchists,</p>
<p>really brilliant people, all the above.</p>
<p>And so I started nights and weekends</p>
<p>trying to put together a prototype.</p>
<p>And my initial thought was,</p>
<p>well, SMTP is a protocol that runs email.</p>
<p>And Git is a protocol for version control</p>
<p>that people made like Gmail and GitHub.</p>
<p>Most people don&rsquo;t wanna run their own email server</p>
<p>or even their own Git server.</p>
<p>They just wanna like use a hosted thing</p>
<p>that will do all the security and backups for them.</p>
<p>So the thought in my head at that time</p>
<p>was Bitcoin&rsquo;s this new protocol.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s probably gonna be somebody</p>
<p>who makes a hosted service</p>
<p>that does all the security and backups for you,</p>
<p>makes Bitcoin as a protocol easy to use.</p>
<p>So maybe I should make like a hosted Bitcoin wallet</p>
<p>or something, that was my,</p>
<p>it was gonna make Gmail for Bitcoin or something.</p>
<p>And a bunch of people told me that was a bad idea.</p>
<p>Like most of my smart friends who I told about it,</p>
<p>they were like,</p>
<p>well, first of all,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really get what you&rsquo;re doing at all.</p>
<p>Like Bitcoin sounds like a scam</p>
<p>or something you&rsquo;ve gotten involved in.</p>
<p>But then other people who understood what Bitcoin was</p>
<p>told me they thought it was a dumb idea</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re like, dude, if you store all this Bitcoin,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just gonna get hacked.</p>
<p>Like nobody, you know, why would you do that?</p>
<p>And so I kind of had this thought like, you know what?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not gonna go all in and like make a store</p>
<p>everyone&rsquo;s Bitcoin, that would be too much right now.</p>
<p>I have a job, I have a day job, you know?</p>
<p>But let me just make a prototype</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll tell people this is like a beta thing.</p>
<p>Like don&rsquo;t put any real money in it</p>
<p>and just see if there&rsquo;s interest.</p>
<p>And if I feel like I&rsquo;m onto something,</p>
<p>maybe I&rsquo;ll go do this as a company.</p>
<p>Cause I did, I really wanted to be an entrepreneur</p>
<p>at that time.</p>
<p>I was like, I was 29, I was almost turning 30.</p>
<p>And I was, I always wanted to like start a company,</p>
<p>but I was, you know, I wasn&rsquo;t yet.</p>
<p>I was an employee at a company that was great.</p>
<p>But so anyway, I had this prototype.</p>
<p>I was hacking together nights and weekends.</p>
<p>I actually wrote a whole Bitcoin node in Ruby,</p>
<p>which turned out to be a, maybe a weird decision</p>
<p>in hindsight, cause Ruby wasn&rsquo;t the most</p>
<p>performant language.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve subsequently had to rebuild that many times.</p>
<p>But yeah, I had this hosted Bitcoin wallet</p>
<p>and the thing that I didn&rsquo;t have any users for it,</p>
<p>by the way, I applied to Y Combinator</p>
<p>cause I was like, maybe if somebody there writes me a check,</p>
<p>this will like make it feel like a real company.</p>
<p>And I was trying to find a co founder at that time</p>
<p>unsuccessfully.</p>
<p>So I was basically just wandering in the desert.</p>
<p>I had a lot of self doubt about this cause I was like,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, all my friends don&rsquo;t think this is kind of dumb</p>
<p>and maybe Bitcoin is just gonna get shut down</p>
<p>and like, this is all be some stupid thing.</p>
<p>So there was definitely a feeling of just wandering</p>
<p>lost in the desert, lots of self doubt.</p>
<p>Paul Graham and the Y Combinator group</p>
<p>kind of wrote me the first check</p>
<p>after I went and interviewed and stuff.</p>
<p>And they wrote me a check for like 150K.</p>
<p>And that was the first time somebody</p>
<p>who I really looked up to kind of said,</p>
<p>this is worth pursuing.</p>
<p>Like maybe you&rsquo;re onto something, maybe you&rsquo;re not,</p>
<p>but like, let&rsquo;s at least try it.</p>
<p>And so that was kind of what gave me the confidence</p>
<p>to quit my job and try it.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll wrap the story here by saying that like we,</p>
<p>I found the right co founder after Y Combinator.</p>
<p>We still didn&rsquo;t have any customers.</p>
<p>The thing that,</p>
<p>I basically launched the hosted Bitcoin wallet.</p>
<p>There were people signing up.</p>
<p>I just posted on Reddit and places like that.</p>
<p>And maybe like a hundred people would sign up</p>
<p>and then nobody would come back.</p>
<p>And so I was like, I just in Y Combinator,</p>
<p>they often tell you like,</p>
<p>talk to your customers and improve your product.</p>
<p>Talk to your customers, improve your product.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all you&rsquo;re supposed to be doing.</p>
<p>Try to find product market fit.</p>
<p>So I emailed like five of the users that had signed up</p>
<p>and I was like, hey, I worked on this app.</p>
<p>I saw you signed up.</p>
<p>Can I get on the phone with you?</p>
<p>I get on the phone with like five of these folks.</p>
<p>And I was like, why didn&rsquo;t you come back?</p>
<p>And the guy was like, well, the app was okay</p>
<p>for a beta, but like, I don&rsquo;t have any Bitcoins.</p>
<p>So I didn&rsquo;t really know what to do with it.</p>
<p>And I remember this light bulb kind of went off in my head.</p>
<p>I was like, well, if I put a buy Bitcoin button in there,</p>
<p>would you have used it?</p>
<p>And he was like, yeah, maybe.</p>
<p>So then I had this, we went about the process.</p>
<p>My co founder at that time,</p>
<p>we like got basically had to get like a bank partnership,</p>
<p>payment rails, you know, an exchange,</p>
<p>basic exchange functionality,</p>
<p>all that stuff I was mentioning earlier in place.</p>
<p>And the minute we launched that feature</p>
<p>where you could just click buy,</p>
<p>put in your bank counter credit card,</p>
<p>buy Bitcoin, it showed up in your account.</p>
<p>From that day forward,</p>
<p>like the number of users started to go up like this.</p>
<p>And so we finally had found product market fit</p>
<p>after two years of wandering in the desert.</p>
<p>So you weren&rsquo;t even thinking about to buy the on ramps.</p>
<p>You would think it would be just the wallet,</p>
<p>a place to store Bitcoin that you&rsquo;ve already gotten.</p>
<p>Yeah. Okay.</p>
<p>This is, I mean, cause that&rsquo;s such a pain to do,</p>
<p>to have to work with others to convert dollars</p>
<p>and fiat currency into Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So did you, I mean,</p>
<p>were you overwhelmed by the immensity of the task here</p>
<p>or were you just sort of not allowing yourself</p>
<p>to think too deeply through this whole thing</p>
<p>and just letting the optimism take over here?</p>
<p>You know, I was really looking forward</p>
<p>to like doing something crazy and like a big challenge.</p>
<p>And I wanted to, I love kind of crisis moments like that</p>
<p>where, you know, I&rsquo;m very determined, right?</p>
<p>And especially when I get like very set on something</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m just like, you know what?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna figure out a way to make this fucking thing work,</p>
<p>like no matter what.</p>
<p>And so I reveled in that.</p>
<p>I was sort of, I had read all these books about startups</p>
<p>and like every startup has these like, you know,</p>
<p>major setbacks and just like nothing works.</p>
<p>And so that was a sign that you&rsquo;re doing something right.</p>
<p>I had no idea if I was doing anything right at all,</p>
<p>but I was like, I was kind of loving the experience of it</p>
<p>in a weird way.</p>
<p>It felt, it felt stressful at the time.</p>
<p>Like, you know, nothing was working and,</p>
<p>but I was just, I felt like I was on the right path somehow.</p>
<p>And so I just kept going, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>What was the darkest moment that you&rsquo;ve gone to</p>
<p>in your mind during that time?</p>
<p>What was, what were some of the tougher moments?</p>
<p>You said self doubt.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Have you, yeah, where&rsquo;d you go?</p>
<p>Where&rsquo;d you go in your mind?</p>
<p>Is there a moment where you&rsquo;re just like laying there?</p>
<p>This is, this is hopeless.</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s a couple of moments I&rsquo;m remembering.</p>
<p>I mean, so for whatever reason,</p>
<p>I had this like big chip on my shoulder at that time.</p>
<p>And I was like,</p>
<p>I really want to do something important in the world.</p>
<p>Like, you know, I could have a good life</p>
<p>and like work for some good companies</p>
<p>and write some software.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m, for some reason, I never wanted that for myself.</p>
<p>That probably would have been healthier, honestly,</p>
<p>just to like, as an expected value outcome,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s probably a better thing in life.</p>
<p>But I was like, I was like, man,</p>
<p>I really want to do something important</p>
<p>and have a bigger impact.</p>
<p>And I was like, I was willing to sacrifice a lot for that.</p>
<p>I was like sleep and not going out with friends and stuff.</p>
<p>I remember one of the,</p>
<p>just for like years working on this stuff,</p>
<p>I remember one of the darker moments was,</p>
<p>we probably had like maybe five employees at that time.</p>
<p>And I remember like a bunch of bad things happened</p>
<p>like all at once.</p>
<p>And it was, so first of all,</p>
<p>you have to remember at this time,</p>
<p>we were all very sleep deprived,</p>
<p>which kind of exacerbates everything.</p>
<p>If you look at like the Exxon Valdez spill</p>
<p>and all these like natural disasters,</p>
<p>like sleep deprivation is often involved.</p>
<p>So, because the reason why we were so sleep deprived</p>
<p>is not just because we were working so much,</p>
<p>but like the site would go offline in the middle of the night</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;d get, I&rsquo;d get paged.</p>
<p>I was like on pager duty.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;d get woken up sometimes</p>
<p>like two or three times a night,</p>
<p>like have to try to fix something, go back to sleep.</p>
<p>So in that environment, you can kind of get,</p>
<p>you can get discouraged.</p>
<p>So one bad thing that happened was,</p>
<p>we had a bug on the website</p>
<p>and there was thousands of people on Reddit and Twitter</p>
<p>who were all like pissed at Coinbase</p>
<p>because like the balances were showing wrong.</p>
<p>And they were just like, fuck this company, it&rsquo;s over.</p>
<p>Like, I hate these guys.</p>
<p>And so that was, I&rsquo;d never had this feeling</p>
<p>of a thousand people mad at me at the same time.</p>
<p>You know, I feel like I&rsquo;m a pretty chill guy.</p>
<p>Like most of the time people don&rsquo;t get mad at me.</p>
<p>So that was one.</p>
<p>Another one was that.</p>
<p>Can we pause on that?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s so interesting.</p>
<p>So you were saying like, here&rsquo;s a dream.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to create something.</p>
<p>And now forever, the reputation of this dream is ruined.</p>
<p>It will never, it&rsquo;s irrecoverable.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s over, that kind of feeling.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, I didn&rsquo;t, you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know at that time.</p>
<p>I was like, is this, is this the end?</p>
<p>Like everybody, we&rsquo;re so, we&rsquo;re so tiny.</p>
<p>Now everybody hates us.</p>
<p>So is it over?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Nobody told me this before starting a company</p>
<p>that like, you&rsquo;re a bunch of people will hate you for this,</p>
<p>which is like a very counterintuitive thing.</p>
<p>Cause you know, most companies I think are doing</p>
<p>good things in the world, at least you&rsquo;re trying, right?</p>
<p>And so even if someone&rsquo;s like trying,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re not, they&rsquo;re failing,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m generally rooting for them.</p>
<p>At least you&rsquo;re trying, right?</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not the case at all.</p>
<p>And most founders I&rsquo;ve known have gone through this too,</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re very surprised at the amount of hate</p>
<p>that they get.</p>
<p>And if it&rsquo;s, I think it&rsquo;s actually like a muscle</p>
<p>you can build your tolerance to it.</p>
<p>Like, because you know, you go talk to somebody who&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>for you, it feels terrible</p>
<p>cause you&rsquo;re at the center of this storm and like,</p>
<p>but if you go, then you go talk to like, you know,</p>
<p>your family or some other person like, dude,</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t even hear about that.</p>
<p>Like my, they&rsquo;re just busy in their own life.</p>
<p>And so they, they have no idea</p>
<p>that you had all this negative press</p>
<p>or like whatever it was.</p>
<p>Can I put once again, put a link on that?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an interesting person I&rsquo;d like to bring up</p>
<p>just as an example, Bill Gates.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So he gets a very large amount of hate on the internet.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s something about him,</p>
<p>this is me talking that you,</p>
<p>that he seems out of touch about that hate.</p>
<p>I believe at least in my understanding</p>
<p>that with the resources he has,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s trying and is actually doing a lot of good.</p>
<p>And yet there&rsquo;s a gigantic amount of hate,</p>
<p>conspiracy theories and stuff like that.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And it feels like that&rsquo;s the case</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s somehow out of touch with people.</p>
<p>So I wonder how you stay in touch</p>
<p>with the voice of the people</p>
<p>without being destroyed by the outrage.</p>
<p>Is there any wisdom you have to that or?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know about wisdom, but I&rsquo;ve thought about this too,</p>
<p>because yeah, you wanna always be open to feedback,</p>
<p>especially from people who have</p>
<p>like your best interests at heart, right?</p>
<p>And if you can become isolated from it</p>
<p>and just like, you know, surrounded by yes people.</p>
<p>And I mean, who knows, maybe like she and Putin</p>
<p>and people like that are in situations I have no idea.</p>
<p>But if you listen to too much of it</p>
<p>and you just try to please everyone,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll never get anything done.</p>
<p>And I mean, most of the best leaders are people</p>
<p>who they can act when they believe</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re doing something net positive</p>
<p>for the world and humanity.</p>
<p>And they actually don&rsquo;t really care</p>
<p>if they piss off some portion of the people.</p>
<p>Almost anything you&rsquo;re gonna do of significance</p>
<p>in the world today is gonna piss off 5% of people,</p>
<p>maybe 49% of people or whatever, maybe 60%, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>So you never wanna become so surrounded</p>
<p>by people who just work for you and will say yes.</p>
<p>And then you think like, well, I&rsquo;m a genius</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m like, that&rsquo;s how you become a dictator or whatever.</p>
<p>But you also can&rsquo;t care so much about what people think</p>
<p>because then you&rsquo;ll never do anything</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s truly authentic to yourself.</p>
<p>One other thought on that, by the way,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a really good question.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve thought about this a lot.</p>
<p>Like why, you know, people generally kind of hate on Zuck</p>
<p>and they hate on Bill Gates and they hate on,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t really hate on Elon.</p>
<p>Well, actually Elon has a lot of haters too,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a different thing.</p>
<p>This is measured, this is measured, I was looking</p>
<p>at some surveys, so I think Zuck is the most,</p>
<p>so loved and hated, right?</p>
<p>Zuckerberg is the most, both loved and hated.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the most hated.</p>
<p>And then I think it&rsquo;s Bill Gates and Elon is down there.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s like 40% hate Zuck, people asked.</p>
<p>And then Elon is in the double digits,</p>
<p>but low double digits.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s interesting, you just look at this data,</p>
<p>ask yourself why.</p>
<p>Right, so I ask myself this sometimes too,</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t claim to know any of these people well,</p>
<p>but like I&rsquo;ve met them briefly.</p>
<p>And my impression is that they&rsquo;re actually all smart people</p>
<p>trying to do good things in the world.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s not too much difference there,</p>
<p>despite public perception.</p>
<p>So why is it that some are really hated and some aren&rsquo;t?</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s a complicated question.</p>
<p>Obviously Zuck in his Facebook got blamed</p>
<p>for the whole election thing and all that didn&rsquo;t help.</p>
<p>Social media has gotten a lot of pressure</p>
<p>just from like, hey, why aren&rsquo;t you solving</p>
<p>all of society&rsquo;s tough problems?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, well, they&rsquo;re just one company.</p>
<p>But one thing I&rsquo;ve noticed is that a lot of these people,</p>
<p>they have like Asperger&rsquo;s, right, a little bit.</p>
<p>And sometimes people with Asperger&rsquo;s</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t really emote in the same way.</p>
<p>And so I think it&rsquo;s almost a form of like</p>
<p>bias against their cognitive type or something,</p>
<p>which is like that person doesn&rsquo;t emote right.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t trust their intentions.</p>
<p>And the other thing I&rsquo;ve thought about too</p>
<p>is that sometimes I think some leaders,</p>
<p>like maybe Zuck or Bill Gates,</p>
<p>they can come across as like a little bit PR rehearsed.</p>
<p>Like they&rsquo;re basically,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re giving the PR approved answers</p>
<p>where Elon just says whatever he thinks like to a fault.</p>
<p>So even if people hate what he says or like,</p>
<p>at least I believe it&rsquo;s authentic.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve always thought about that too for myself.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, how do I,</p>
<p>cause you can fuck it up on both sides, right?</p>
<p>Like if you just come out and you&rsquo;re like saying</p>
<p>whatever stream of consciousness,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll often end up like pissing off people on your team</p>
<p>or like saying tripping over some like regulation</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve, there&rsquo;s all kinds of things</p>
<p>about running a public company,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t say certain stuff.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re too PR approved and your answer is like,</p>
<p>nobody trusts you what you&rsquo;re saying.</p>
<p>And so anyway, this is something I think about a lot.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I have the right answer,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m trying to find that balance.</p>
<p>And more and more with the internet, there&rsquo;s a premium</p>
<p>on authenticity, just like you&rsquo;re saying.</p>
<p>People really, really appreciate that.</p>
<p>So for leaders, it&rsquo;s a challenge to be,</p>
<p>how do I make sure I&rsquo;m authentic,</p>
<p>but also don&rsquo;t say stupid shit.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s an interesting thing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve noticed that just having interacted</p>
<p>with a bunch of leaders that you have to be careful</p>
<p>how much you surround yourself with PR folks.</p>
<p>Because the best, I would say, let me just say a nice thing</p>
<p>about marketing and PR folks,</p>
<p>the best marketing folks are extremely good.</p>
<p>So they understand exactly what great marketing is</p>
<p>and great PR, it&rsquo;s authenticity.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s showing, revealing the beauty.</p>
<p>As opposed to PR and marketing out of fear.</p>
<p>Oh, don&rsquo;t say that, don&rsquo;t say this, don&rsquo;t that.</p>
<p>Because then you start living in this kind of,</p>
<p>that pushes you towards a bubble</p>
<p>where you can&rsquo;t express the,</p>
<p>your beautiful quirks and weirdness</p>
<p>and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>And also the cool, the beautiful things</p>
<p>about what you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>I find like, especially with tech things,</p>
<p>like even like Coinbase,</p>
<p>the way to reveal the beauty of it</p>
<p>is not only by showing all the things you could do with it,</p>
<p>but showing that there&rsquo;s great engineering</p>
<p>going on underneath.</p>
<p>So letting the nerds shine too.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t have to be like these kind of commercials</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s like a happy family using Coinbase</p>
<p>to send a transaction about flowers for mom</p>
<p>or something like that.</p>
<p>Like it could be also like gritty stuff and real stuff.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a general just observation I made.</p>
<p>But you said you were talking about dark moments</p>
<p>and that there&rsquo;s people on the internet</p>
<p>that were pissed off that the site was down.</p>
<p>And you said there might be something else.</p>
<p>Yeah, so sleep deprived,</p>
<p>like a bunch of people on the internet were pissed at me.</p>
<p>The balances were fucked up.</p>
<p>Like people were tweeting the company&rsquo;s over,</p>
<p>just give the money back, whatever.</p>
<p>And then, oh yeah, somebody posted.</p>
<p>So we had all this, we didn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>we started to get all these customer support inquiries</p>
<p>and like, we only had like a few people at the company.</p>
<p>And so we were backed up maybe like 20,000 support requests.</p>
<p>So people couldn&rsquo;t get ahold of us.</p>
<p>So somebody posted my cell phone number on Reddit</p>
<p>and they were like, they were like,</p>
<p>if you need to get ahold of the CEO, whatever,</p>
<p>cause everyone&rsquo;s upset about where their money is.</p>
<p>So I remember we&rsquo;re in the office,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like late at night.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been working like 12 hours, we&rsquo;re all sleep deprived.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to hack and like get this bug fixed.</p>
<p>And we all need like food at the office.</p>
<p>And so my phone has been blowing up all day</p>
<p>cause someone posted my phone number on the internet.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s like a guy,</p>
<p>there was a guy like trying to deliver food</p>
<p>and I needed to answer my phone</p>
<p>to like get the food from downstairs.</p>
<p>So I was like, shit, I gotta just see who, if that&rsquo;s him.</p>
<p>So I started answering the call and it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>is this Brian?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, nope, wrong number, click.</p>
<p>And I pick up the next call.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like every, when I finished the call,</p>
<p>another call is like coming in.</p>
<p>So I was like, I&rsquo;m a reporter from Japan,</p>
<p>like asking about a security, nope, wrong number, click.</p>
<p>And then I like, finally I get the delivery guy downstairs,</p>
<p>bring the food up.</p>
<p>We were all like surviving to like fix this bug.</p>
<p>I remember there was just basically a point that night</p>
<p>where I was like, fuck, I need to just,</p>
<p>I basically just curled up on like a ball on the floor.</p>
<p>And I just like cried for a little bit.</p>
<p>I think I let myself just kind of wallow in self pity,</p>
<p>kind of took a nap for about five minutes.</p>
<p>And I was like, let&rsquo;s fucking solve this.</p>
<p>And I like, you know, stop being like a little whatever</p>
<p>and like got back up.</p>
<p>Sleep deprivation combined with just the stress</p>
<p>and the pressure of the site going down</p>
<p>and everybody wants the site to be up.</p>
<p>Just the pressure from people</p>
<p>and the number of users is growing and growing and growing.</p>
<p>So that pressure is just mentally, mentally tough.</p>
<p>What was your source of strength during that time?</p>
<p>Like what, like somebody that patted you on the back</p>
<p>and said, we got this.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, it definitely helped to have a co founder.</p>
<p>So, you know, there&rsquo;s like that old saying about</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s better to be in a great relationship than to be single,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s better to be single than in a bad relationship.</p>
<p>So co founders actually blow up a lot of companies too.</p>
<p>But when you find the right co founder,</p>
<p>which I was lucky to find with, with Fred or some,</p>
<p>that was very important.</p>
<p>There was definitely moments where, you know,</p>
<p>I was like kind of, you know, at the width end or whatever.</p>
<p>And he was like, it&rsquo;s like, dude, let&rsquo;s rally.</p>
<p>Like, and he basically carried the team, you know,</p>
<p>a couple of times, like in really key moments.</p>
<p>What advice would you give to startup founders</p>
<p>about this particular stage about surviving it</p>
<p>to the five and through the five employees stage</p>
<p>where you were?</p>
<p>Yeah, well, if your pre product market fit,</p>
<p>the best advice that I have from that period</p>
<p>is action produces information.</p>
<p>So just like keep doing stuff, you know,</p>
<p>I remember like Paul Graham, Paul Graham had this great</p>
<p>line like that.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s his line.</p>
<p>And he was like, startups are like sharks.</p>
<p>If they stop swimming, they die.</p>
<p>You know, so even if you&rsquo;re like, not sure what to do,</p>
<p>like just do anything because when you do it,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll like, it&rsquo;ll produce some information.</p>
<p>Like people liked it.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t, this was very true for me.</p>
<p>There was times where I just did something</p>
<p>instead of debating it endlessly and like, just try it.</p>
<p>You know, like, all right.</p>
<p>So we shipped it.</p>
<p>And like, there was a couple of times where like</p>
<p>the minute I shipped it and I was like, I knew,</p>
<p>I know we built this wrong,</p>
<p>but now I have an idea of what to do next.</p>
<p>And it wasn&rsquo;t, I only would have had the idea</p>
<p>if we&rsquo;d actually gone through the exercise</p>
<p>of going to build it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like my other favorite analogy for this is that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re like at the base of a mountain that&rsquo;s shrouded</p>
<p>in fog and you&rsquo;re looking up at the mountain</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re trying to think like, okay,</p>
<p>how do I get up there?</p>
<p>But you can only see like three or four steps ahead</p>
<p>cause the fog is so thick.</p>
<p>So you have to just take steps into the unknown.</p>
<p>And when you take three steps,</p>
<p>another three steps will be revealed ahead of you.</p>
<p>And sometimes you&rsquo;ll end up on some local maximum.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll have to retrace your steps or whatever,</p>
<p>but, or come up to a cliff, you know,</p>
<p>but most people in life don&rsquo;t take the steps into the fog,</p>
<p>into the unknown because it&rsquo;s scary.</p>
<p>Or they&rsquo;re like, I don&rsquo;t know, what if I fail?</p>
<p>Or like, I don&rsquo;t know how that&rsquo;s going to work</p>
<p>or I might run out of money</p>
<p>or I won&rsquo;t be able to get a job after,</p>
<p>or I don&rsquo;t know, whatever reason.</p>
<p>But that is like one of the things that separates,</p>
<p>I think entrepreneurial people with that kind of inclination</p>
<p>is that they have sort of a comfort with this risk tolerance</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s actually not really risky if you think about it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like, you know, at least in most places,</p>
<p>like, you know, if you go to a startup and it fails,</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;re going to, you&rsquo;re even more valuable</p>
<p>to your next employer, right?</p>
<p>Or you can go raise a seed round, pay yourself a salary,</p>
<p>try it for like two years or three years.</p>
<p>If it doesn&rsquo;t work, go get another job.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like you&rsquo;re,</p>
<p>you weren&rsquo;t paying yourself a salary during that time.</p>
<p>So I think, I think people overestimate the risk</p>
<p>of doing a startup and they just never,</p>
<p>they never start because it seems crazy</p>
<p>and all your friends think it&rsquo;s silly.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s sort of the default nature</p>
<p>of every big startup idea.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just basic fear.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same kind of fear that if you see a,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re a guy, see a cute girl at a bar,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the fear associated with coming up to her,</p>
<p>you like her, asking her.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, what&rsquo;s the actual risk exactly?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;ll say, no thanks, I&rsquo;m not interested.</p>
<p>No thanks.</p>
<p>I guess the risk is like,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to be mentally difficult</p>
<p>to deal with rejection.</p>
<p>So just like it&rsquo;s mentally difficult to deal with failure.</p>
<p>If you had a bunch of ideas and you were excited about them</p>
<p>and you implement them and you realize they&rsquo;re not good,</p>
<p>that could be difficult to keep pushing through that.</p>
<p>But I suppose that&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re supposed to, you know,</p>
<p>perseverance through the failures and then the risk is low.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s, and then the whole time through the fog</p>
<p>up the mountain, you&rsquo;re looking for product market fit.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>So you know, you have it when the usage of your product</p>
<p>keeps growing without any marketing dollars</p>
<p>or anything like that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like more people keep coming back</p>
<p>every week or month.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re kind of keep,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re basically watching your stats.</p>
<p>Nothing is working.</p>
<p>You see these little wiggles of false hope in your metrics</p>
<p>and you basically just keep talking to customers,</p>
<p>fixing the, improving the product,</p>
<p>talk to customers, improve the product,</p>
<p>talk to customers, improve product, you know,</p>
<p>and try not to run out of money.</p>
<p>So be really scrappy.</p>
<p>And then if you&rsquo;re lucky, you hit some kind of threshold</p>
<p>where like, okay, the thing is good enough now,</p>
<p>or we hit on some use case and then it&rsquo;ll organically</p>
<p>start to grow a bit.</p>
<p>And then you have a whole different set of problems</p>
<p>once you hit product market fit,</p>
<p>which is how do we scale this thing?</p>
<p>How do we hire people?</p>
<p>How do we, you know, hire an executive team</p>
<p>or raise more money?</p>
<p>And like, so the problems totally change, but yeah.</p>
<p>Well, you were there through the whole thing.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the other question that&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>Again, back to the girl at the bar,</p>
<p>how do you hire people?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, how do you find good friends?</p>
<p>How do you find good relationships?</p>
<p>And in this specific case, how do you hire good people?</p>
<p>Engineers, executive, all of it.</p>
<p>One thing is I&rsquo;ve done a lot of reps on hiring</p>
<p>at this point.</p>
<p>So Coinbase has about 5,000 people,</p>
<p>probably the first 500 people or something,</p>
<p>maybe in that range.</p>
<p>You know, I interviewed every single one of those,</p>
<p>but you have to remember there&rsquo;s probably like,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, on average, maybe 10 people</p>
<p>that we went in the process for every one we hired</p>
<p>or something.</p>
<p>So it was like, by the time that we had 500 employees,</p>
<p>I had done like 5,000 interviews or something.</p>
<p>I was like very burned out on interviews.</p>
<p>I had been doing, some days I did like seven interviews</p>
<p>in a day or maybe, you know, you&rsquo;ve been doing</p>
<p>lots of interviews, maybe you wouldn&rsquo;t get burned out,</p>
<p>but different kind of interviews.</p>
<p>Very different, very different, very different,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re, so first of all,</p>
<p>most of your interviews lead to rejection.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Which is also exhausting.</p>
<p>Yeah, and there&rsquo;s a whole part of the interview</p>
<p>which is about candidate experience, right?</p>
<p>Sometimes you know it&rsquo;s not the right person,</p>
<p>but you wanna make sure they have a good experience.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Like, if you&rsquo;re just exhausted</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re on your sixth interview</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re like, well, thanks for coming in</p>
<p>and you wrap and you just, and then like,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna create a detractor.</p>
<p>Someone who&rsquo;s out there like, fuck that company</p>
<p>or Brian was rude to me or whatever.</p>
<p>So I had to, honestly, I had to work on that a little bit</p>
<p>in the early days because I was doing so many interviews.</p>
<p>Like I needed to make sure that when people came in,</p>
<p>I was like, you know, made them feel comfortable,</p>
<p>asked them a couple of like warmup questions,</p>
<p>just like, oh, how was it getting in the office?</p>
<p>Like, did you find it okay?</p>
<p>And like, what have you been up to this week?</p>
<p>And not just like, you know, like a factory assembly line</p>
<p>like boom, boom, boom, like, yeah.</p>
<p>But also there&rsquo;s a moment,</p>
<p>cause I&rsquo;ve interviewed a bunch of people</p>
<p>for like teams and stuff.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also a moment when you, early on,</p>
<p>know it&rsquo;s not gonna be a good fit</p>
<p>and you still have to land that plane</p>
<p>and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>And that could get really, really, really exhausting.</p>
<p>So yeah, anyway, sorry.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>Yeah, so basically we tried all,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve tried so many things over the years</p>
<p>to make interviews more efficient</p>
<p>cause it&rsquo;s a huge time sink for the team.</p>
<p>So, you know, we basically,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll usually get them down to like 25 minutes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen, if you&rsquo;re trying to hire like a big team,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say, you know,</p>
<p>of people who are like contractors or something,</p>
<p>not necessarily full time employees.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen people actually do 10 minute interviews.</p>
<p>You can even interview like a thousand people</p>
<p>almost like in a week or something.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if that quite works out,</p>
<p>but let me a little less than that.</p>
<p>But you can basically get six and six done in an hour.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re just, I need to get a team of 30 contractors</p>
<p>for whatever purpose.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re talking about full time employees,</p>
<p>I usually do like 25 minute.</p>
<p>You know, you&rsquo;re oftentimes like,</p>
<p>one thing we&rsquo;ve done is we&rsquo;ll put like a Google form online</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like, put some basic hurdles in there.</p>
<p>Like, you know, ask them to put in an answer,</p>
<p>which you can check in a spreadsheet</p>
<p>if it was correct or not.</p>
<p>And like, there was some funny examples</p>
<p>in the early days of Coinbase</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;d put in like brain teasers and stuff,</p>
<p>but we don&rsquo;t do that anymore.</p>
<p>We do like normal interviews, we do references.</p>
<p>The kinds of things I ask in interviews,</p>
<p>you know, it&rsquo;s usually like,</p>
<p>I like to think about what do we need this person</p>
<p>to accomplish in this role, right?</p>
<p>And get really specific about that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like usually something pretty hard.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;ll ask them a question.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, tell me about a time you did X</p>
<p>and, or tell me about the hardest,</p>
<p>the hardest kind of problem you&rsquo;ve had to solve in Y</p>
<p>and what did you do specifically to overcome it, right?</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m asking to see if they can actually do the stuff</p>
<p>we need to get done.</p>
<p>But then I&rsquo;m also kind of asking like culture questions</p>
<p>if I&rsquo;m interviewing for that.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m trying to see like,</p>
<p>are they concise communicators?</p>
<p>Can they just give me a clear answer and stop talking?</p>
<p>Some people like ramble on for like five, 10 minutes</p>
<p>if you ask the first question.</p>
<p>Some people are, you know, they&rsquo;re interrupters</p>
<p>like church of interruption.</p>
<p>So like they won&rsquo;t stop talking until you interrupt them,</p>
<p>which for me, I&rsquo;m always patient and I wait.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s weird.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking to see for humility too.</p>
<p>Like, you know, I&rsquo;ll tell us people,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you about a time something went really wrong.</p>
<p>Like you had conflict with someone on a team</p>
<p>or what I&rsquo;m kind of looking for is,</p>
<p>were they part of the solution</p>
<p>or are they still holding onto like blame and criticism</p>
<p>about that and be like,</p>
<p>well, I told them they shouldn&rsquo;t do that way,</p>
<p>but they didn&rsquo;t listen to me.</p>
<p>And you know, these are all like bad signs.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m looking for, yeah, can they get the job done?</p>
<p>Will they work together on a team?</p>
<p>Can they communicate effectively?</p>
<p>Do they fit into our cultural values and you know,</p>
<p>those kinds of things.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, there&rsquo;s a,</p>
<p>cause I&rsquo;ve even for help with this podcast here,</p>
<p>but also at MIT and so on, I&rsquo;ve done a bunch of hiring</p>
<p>and I was always looking for, you said, brain teasers,</p>
<p>all kinds of simple questions that can,</p>
<p>they can reveal a lot of information</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s always been challenging.</p>
<p>I used to, I still ask this question,</p>
<p>but do you think it&rsquo;s better to work hard or work smart?</p>
<p>And you know, I had this idea that I&rsquo;ve,</p>
<p>that I think I&rsquo;ve matured about,</p>
<p>which is I kind of believe that people who say work smart</p>
<p>on that question don&rsquo;t actually work smart.</p>
<p>So the right textbook answer is it&rsquo;s better to work smart.</p>
<p>But the reality is it&rsquo;s people that haven&rsquo;t actually</p>
<p>ever done anything that say work smart.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like, they haven&rsquo;t really struggled</p>
<p>because my general belief at the time</p>
<p>was in order to discover what it means to work smart,</p>
<p>to be efficient, to, you have to work your ass off.</p>
<p>So you have to really fail a lot</p>
<p>and failure feels like hard work.</p>
<p>And so I was always suspicious of people</p>
<p>that would say work smart.</p>
<p>I would want to interrogate that question.</p>
<p>But then I also, you know, have learned that there is people</p>
<p>that are just exceptionally, exceptionally efficient.</p>
<p>They really do know what it means to work smart,</p>
<p>even at a young age.</p>
<p>And so like, you can&rsquo;t just disqualify based on that.</p>
<p>You have to dig in deeper.</p>
<p>But some of the most interesting people I&rsquo;ve ever worked</p>
<p>with would say work hard unapologetically.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re usually the ones that know how to be efficient,</p>
<p>which is, it&rsquo;s just an interesting thing like that.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve always searched for questions of that nature</p>
<p>to see can I get a person to reveal something profound</p>
<p>about them in as brief of a question as possible?</p>
<p>And I, you know, and then of course,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s basic attention to detail and brain teasers</p>
<p>and stuff like that, depending on the role,</p>
<p>programming and so on to see can they solve a tricky puzzle</p>
<p>and do so, like one that doesn&rsquo;t require a lot of effort,</p>
<p>but requires a certain nonlinear way of thinking.</p>
<p>Is there some, I mean, maybe you don&rsquo;t want to reveal,</p>
<p>but is there some questions that you sometimes</p>
<p>find yourself leaning on?</p>
<p>You said like, how did you solve a hard problem</p>
<p>in your past and have them talk through it?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one.</p>
<p>You know, we started with brain teasers periodically</p>
<p>at Coinbase and we got away from that relatively quickly.</p>
<p>And I think one, it&rsquo;s a tough one</p>
<p>because I actually think it does show how somebody</p>
<p>kind of performs under pressure,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a super reliable indicator</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s some people who are really good</p>
<p>in the typical work situation,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s not a typical work situation</p>
<p>where somebody puts you on the spot,</p>
<p>like in a live interview and sometimes people get nervous</p>
<p>and they can&rsquo;t think clearly</p>
<p>and like they don&rsquo;t have their computer in front of them</p>
<p>or whatever they normally use.</p>
<p>So yeah, I&rsquo;m a little skeptical now</p>
<p>of the brain teaser thing.</p>
<p>There is a whole, yeah, there is a whole question about,</p>
<p>like a lot of universities are getting rid of,</p>
<p>you know, entrance exams.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re hiring right out of universities,</p>
<p>sometimes it&rsquo;s becoming a less reliable indicator</p>
<p>of like, are they in that university?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve heard some companies, we haven&rsquo;t done this yet,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve heard some companies are actually creating</p>
<p>their own like for college grads,</p>
<p>like their own basically exams, like standardized testing</p>
<p>almost to get people in the door</p>
<p>because the degree almost like doesn&rsquo;t mean</p>
<p>what it used to, which is the whole topic, but.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s fascinating because it&rsquo;s fascinating both</p>
<p>for that, because it&rsquo;s not just about you trying</p>
<p>to hire a great team, it&rsquo;s also to help them find</p>
<p>the right place to work at.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a two way street.</p>
<p>All right, so once you found the product market fit,</p>
<p>how did Coinbase become what it is today?</p>
<p>Ooh.</p>
<p>So let me ask an engineering question actually.</p>
<p>Sort of from the Ruby wallet days,</p>
<p>what are some of the interesting challenges there?</p>
<p>Or are they not engineering?</p>
<p>Just the things that had to be solved, what were they?</p>
<p>Engineering, regulation,</p>
<p>financial hiring, lawyers, what was it?</p>
<p>So post product market fit, yeah, a lot of it&rsquo;s scaling</p>
<p>and you got to build out an actual company.</p>
<p>So I remember I was still writing a lot of code there</p>
<p>for a while and we were hiring in,</p>
<p>we had like maybe 25 people or something.</p>
<p>I remember one of our investors came by one day</p>
<p>and he was like, Brian, how much of your time</p>
<p>are you spending writing code?</p>
<p>And I was like, maybe 50% or something.</p>
<p>And he was like, how much time are you spending hiring people?</p>
<p>I was like, probably 20%.</p>
<p>And he was like, I think you need to flip those numbers.</p>
<p>Like this company is not going to scale.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re the CEO, you don&rsquo;t need to be writing code every day.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to have to transition that stuff.</p>
<p>Like even if people can&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>all that stuff&rsquo;s locked in your head.</p>
<p>So maybe they&rsquo;re not going to do it as well as you</p>
<p>for the first six months or something.</p>
<p>But like, if you don&rsquo;t start to transition it,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re never going to build a real company.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just going to be, you&rsquo;re going to be the bottleneck.</p>
<p>So, you know, like a lot of founders that took me a while</p>
<p>to like really internalize that lesson.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d always heard people say that and, you know,</p>
<p>but I still was holding on too much to decision making.</p>
<p>And I probably still am, by the way,</p>
<p>like even to this day at Coinbase,</p>
<p>where we continually have to push down decision making</p>
<p>in the org, like even with 5,000 people,</p>
<p>like who are the owners of each of these things?</p>
<p>And so the temptation is people to push it up</p>
<p>and you become a bottleneck.</p>
<p>And anyway, so yeah, you basically need to make sure</p>
<p>you have enough money where you don&rsquo;t die</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s some kind of a downturn</p>
<p>or hit break even profitability.</p>
<p>We were in a position where we were periodically profitable</p>
<p>during up periods, but then crypto would go down</p>
<p>and we were unprofitable.</p>
<p>And so we had to kind of manage our own psychology</p>
<p>and the balance sheet to make sure we didn&rsquo;t like die</p>
<p>in the downturn, which a lot of crypto companies did.</p>
<p>We had to basically professionalize a whole bunch</p>
<p>of services that had been just very quickly thrown together</p>
<p>by like 20 year olds, right?</p>
<p>Whether that was cybersecurity, it&rsquo;s like, okay,</p>
<p>how do you get like a really senior experienced</p>
<p>cybersecurity person, but not someone who&rsquo;s so senior</p>
<p>that they can&rsquo;t get their hands dirty</p>
<p>and they can come into a company with 25, 50 people.</p>
<p>How do you get a finance person to come in and do that?</p>
<p>Our finances were a mess.</p>
<p>Like we didn&rsquo;t even really know how much money we had</p>
<p>at certain times and stuff.</p>
<p>I mean, this was, it&rsquo;s embarrassing to say,</p>
<p>but it was true.</p>
<p>Like I remember there was a point where we had raised,</p>
<p>I think like our series C or something like that.</p>
<p>And I think we had our bank accounts.</p>
<p>I just put like $25 million, like in a different bank</p>
<p>account that none of this stuff was touched</p>
<p>to the actual operations of business.</p>
<p>Cause I was like, our operations were so messy</p>
<p>and we needed to hire a new finance person.</p>
<p>And I was like, I&rsquo;d heard horror stories</p>
<p>of actually startups where they thought</p>
<p>they had X amount of money.</p>
<p>And then it turned out they had way less.</p>
<p>And then the whole thing was insolvent in like three weeks.</p>
<p>So you wanted to have some padding to at least like,</p>
<p>all right, I can at least count on this to save us</p>
<p>if we go to like super negative.</p>
<p>Right, I mean, it was like a cheap hack,</p>
<p>but that was like the only I could come up with.</p>
<p>And until we could hire like a real CFO and finance team</p>
<p>who like, okay, now we got our arms around</p>
<p>how much cash we have.</p>
<p>It sounds silly, but we had such high volume</p>
<p>of money coming in and out.</p>
<p>Anyway.</p>
<p>What was the ordering of hiring by the way?</p>
<p>Like how many engineers was it early on?</p>
<p>You said CFO was not, you didn&rsquo;t even have a CFO for a bit.</p>
<p>Like what was the landscape of hiring</p>
<p>as you building up this company?</p>
<p>Was it engineering focused?</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s see.</p>
<p>I mean, so the first person we hired was just like,</p>
<p>we need to solve customer support.</p>
<p>So we brought someone to do that</p>
<p>because we were all staying up till midnight every night</p>
<p>trying to do customer support.</p>
<p>And then we got more engineers.</p>
<p>And then I think maybe the sixth hire</p>
<p>or something like that was a recruiter.</p>
<p>Cause that turned out to be, you need to build,</p>
<p>hire the person who can hire more people.</p>
<p>That turned out to be a great force multiplier.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;re going down the list.</p>
<p>Eventually you want to hire some more senior people.</p>
<p>We needed legal and compliance.</p>
<p>We needed that really badly.</p>
<p>Cause we, it was all kinds of questions about</p>
<p>what the legality of it was.</p>
<p>Was it hard to find legal people that work with crypto,</p>
<p>like serious adults?</p>
<p>Cause it&rsquo;s such a cutting edge new world.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, there was nobody who had like more than,</p>
<p>nobody had three years of experience with it</p>
<p>cause it had only been around a few years.</p>
<p>So yeah, we were finding people from adjacent fields.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a certain personality type of people</p>
<p>who are willing to join early companies</p>
<p>because they have no structure.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t really commit to them about</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to have this team or this boss or whatever.</p>
<p>Like everything&rsquo;s in chaos and flux.</p>
<p>So it takes, yeah, hiring is one of the hardest things</p>
<p>in the early stage for sure.</p>
<p>You got to find people crazy enough</p>
<p>to join you on this journey.</p>
<p>So one of the interesting things about Coinbase</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve written, we&rsquo;ve talked, we&rsquo;ll talk about it a bit.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re very focused on the mission.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re very kind of, I think that simplifies things</p>
<p>that makes hiring easier,</p>
<p>that makes working at Coinbase easier,</p>
<p>that makes, I mean, it&rsquo;s similar.</p>
<p>So Elon has the same thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty clear.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty clear what we&rsquo;re here to do.</p>
<p>So I suppose what&rsquo;s the mission of Coinbase?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s to increase economic freedom in the world.</p>
<p>And what is economic freedom?</p>
<p>Yeah, so economic freedom is this term kind of like GDP</p>
<p>that economists use.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s basically a measure of different countries</p>
<p>around the world.</p>
<p>It looks at things like,</p>
<p>are there property rights enforced?</p>
<p>Is there free trade?</p>
<p>Is the currency stable?</p>
<p>Can you start companies that you wanna start?</p>
<p>And can you join the ones you wanna join?</p>
<p>And is there corruption and bribery prevalent</p>
<p>or is it relatively free of that?</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s several different organizations</p>
<p>that basically score countries by economic freedom.</p>
<p>And the really cool thing about economic freedom</p>
<p>is that basically it positively correlates</p>
<p>with things that we all want in society,</p>
<p>like not only higher growth of the economy,</p>
<p>but also things like higher self reported happiness</p>
<p>of citizens, better treatment of the environment,</p>
<p>better income for the poorest 10% of people.</p>
<p>And it negatively correlates with things</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t want in society,</p>
<p>like corruption and bribery and war,</p>
<p>even in things like that.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s this pretty crazy provocative idea,</p>
<p>which is that if you give people good property rights</p>
<p>and rule of law and allow them to trade,</p>
<p>it basically encourages them to do more good stuff</p>
<p>and the whole society benefits.</p>
<p>Like one of the things, you may have noticed this</p>
<p>growing up in various places you did,</p>
<p>or I spent a year living in Buenos Aires, Argentina</p>
<p>that went through hyperinflation.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a certain like pessimism</p>
<p>that can creep into countries</p>
<p>when they don&rsquo;t have economic freedom,</p>
<p>which it&rsquo;s basically like everyone has this bit of this vibe,</p>
<p>which is like, don&rsquo;t stick your head up,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t try too hard because it could all be gone tomorrow.</p>
<p>Like the things that really are valuable in life</p>
<p>are just family and friends</p>
<p>and the past was better than the future will be.</p>
<p>And so you don&rsquo;t really, people don&rsquo;t try as many,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t try hard because you&rsquo;re not really sure</p>
<p>you can actually keep the upside of your labor</p>
<p>if you try hard, so you just don&rsquo;t try as hard.</p>
<p>Whereas in America, historically,</p>
<p>or high economic freedom countries,</p>
<p>people basically like they just try more stuff</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re like, if I do good for other people,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll get to keep part of it for myself</p>
<p>and I can improve my lot in life</p>
<p>and for my children and my community, whatever.</p>
<p>So I realized when I read the Bitcoin white paper</p>
<p>a long time ago, that at least I had a hunch.</p>
<p>At the time I was like,</p>
<p>this might be a really powerful piece of technology</p>
<p>that can inject good financial infrastructure</p>
<p>into all these countries around the world that don&rsquo;t have it.</p>
<p>Basically good economic freedom principles</p>
<p>in like property rights and things like that</p>
<p>into these countries all over the world,</p>
<p>which just as long as you had a smartphone</p>
<p>and now crypto got invented,</p>
<p>everybody could have economic freedom.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s crypto is kind of really well suited</p>
<p>for economic freedom,</p>
<p>because if you want property rights,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s based like crypto is,</p>
<p>if you can remember a 12 word phrase</p>
<p>or have an app on your phone,</p>
<p>you can store as much wealth as you want.</p>
<p>And it can&rsquo;t be taken away from you.</p>
<p>You can even, there&rsquo;s like refugees who need to flee</p>
<p>and they wanna take their wealth with them</p>
<p>and they can&rsquo;t do it often</p>
<p>in the traditional financial system.</p>
<p>And so crypto lets them do that, right?</p>
<p>Crypto is inherently global.</p>
<p>So it allows free trade and cross border payments.</p>
<p>It makes it easy to accept payments from people globally.</p>
<p>It provides a stable currency to everyone,</p>
<p>not only with Bitcoin,</p>
<p>which is kind of like this new reserve currency,</p>
<p>but also with stable coins, right?</p>
<p>Which are new inventions there.</p>
<p>So yeah, I basically feel like crypto</p>
<p>is this secret hiding in plain sight</p>
<p>that can create economic freedom</p>
<p>for people all over the world</p>
<p>and a more fair and free and global economy.</p>
<p>Well, so the limit,</p>
<p>and by the way, I didn&rsquo;t know about Argentina.</p>
<p>Why&rsquo;d you end up in Argentina?</p>
<p>Okay, so I was basically,</p>
<p>I was living in Houston, Texas after college</p>
<p>where I went to school.</p>
<p>And I had never studied abroad.</p>
<p>I kind of like, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>I felt like I needed some adventure or something in my life.</p>
<p>And I was like, I was running this other startup</p>
<p>that I was trying at the time, a tutoring company,</p>
<p>and I could work from anywhere.</p>
<p>So my plan was, you know what,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just gonna go do like a month</p>
<p>in every city around South America,</p>
<p>just like almost like to force myself</p>
<p>out of my comfort zone</p>
<p>because I had never traveled by myself</p>
<p>to a foreign country or whatever,</p>
<p>and where I didn&rsquo;t really speak the language.</p>
<p>And anyway, I landed in Buenos Aires</p>
<p>thinking I&rsquo;d go all around South America</p>
<p>where I had never been there.</p>
<p>But I basically, once I was set up in Buenos Aires</p>
<p>with an apartment and a cell phone and stuff,</p>
<p>then I was like, I don&rsquo;t wanna do that all again next month.</p>
<p>So I just stayed there for most of the time</p>
<p>and took some day trips.</p>
<p>But yeah, it was kind of a formative experience</p>
<p>in that regard.</p>
<p>You got a chance sort of unexpectedly</p>
<p>to experience the social effects of hyperinflation,</p>
<p>which is interesting.</p>
<p>But I also, I&rsquo;ve never been,</p>
<p>I really, really wanna go as a person who likes tangos,</p>
<p>a person who likes the Argentinian national team</p>
<p>and soccer and steak.</p>
<p>All right, and all the other things</p>
<p>that Argentina is known for.</p>
<p>Okay, so economic freedom.</p>
<p>One of the limits on economic freedom</p>
<p>comes from government and government regulations</p>
<p>and all those kinds of things throughout the world.</p>
<p>So how does cryptocurrency help resist that?</p>
<p>So can you sort of elaborate a little bit further?</p>
<p>What are the things that limit economic freedom</p>
<p>and how does crypto help ease that?</p>
<p>Today the world, like the traditional financial system</p>
<p>is basically every country of the world for the most part</p>
<p>has their own currency.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s a group of people or institutions</p>
<p>in each of those countries that&rsquo;s controlling</p>
<p>that economic policy or that money supply.</p>
<p>And it can be manipulated, right?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not like many of these currencies</p>
<p>are not linked to gold standard.</p>
<p>The U.S. kind of famously came off that in 1970s,</p>
<p>for instance, but if you read Ray Dalio and all this stuff</p>
<p>like he talks about, there&rsquo;s thousands of fiat currencies</p>
<p>that have been in existence over time.</p>
<p>And basically all of them eventually get disconnected</p>
<p>from backing of like hard commodities</p>
<p>and then they get overinflated and printed.</p>
<p>And so in times of stress, with Nixon,</p>
<p>I guess it was like in the U.S. it was the Vietnam War</p>
<p>or something like that.</p>
<p>It kind of drove government spending.</p>
<p>And so under times of stress, they say,</p>
<p>hey, it&rsquo;s a temporary measure.</p>
<p>We need to break the peg.</p>
<p>Temporary was like famous words that he used</p>
<p>and they go print.</p>
<p>And so the bad thing about that, of course,</p>
<p>is that it sort of erodes people&rsquo;s like wealth</p>
<p>if they can only hold their assets in cash,</p>
<p>which basically like poor people tend to do that.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re wealthy, you can hold stocks</p>
<p>or like real estate and things like that.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s really a tax on the poorest people</p>
<p>in society, inflation.</p>
<p>So anyway, crypto in a way is a little bit</p>
<p>of like a return to the gold standard</p>
<p>in this digital era, right?</p>
<p>Bitcoin, there&rsquo;s guaranteed scarcity of it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s deflationary.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s never gonna be more than 21 million Bitcoin.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s a really important principle.</p>
<p>I also think not just Bitcoin,</p>
<p>but like cryptocurrency generally,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really important in terms of this,</p>
<p>you asked about regulation, right?</p>
<p>So think about like, if you wanted to make a global borrowing</p>
<p>and lending marketplace or a global exchange,</p>
<p>you would have to go to all 200 countries in the world,</p>
<p>sometimes like maybe 50 states in the US</p>
<p>and get lending licenses or an operating exchange</p>
<p>or whatever.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s just an incredible amount of work.</p>
<p>And you can&rsquo;t even do business in many of these countries</p>
<p>because like you have to bribe somebody</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s corrupt or whatever.</p>
<p>And so, but with DeFi, with decentralized finance,</p>
<p>people have published like Uniswap</p>
<p>as a decentralized exchange.</p>
<p>Everybody in the world, no matter what country you&rsquo;re in,</p>
<p>what jurisdiction can interface</p>
<p>with that decentralized exchange</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s no central company operating it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain,</p>
<p>which is globally decentralized.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s no throat to choke.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no one person or a company you can go to</p>
<p>to like, hey, shut this thing down.</p>
<p>Even if everybody who&rsquo;s working on Uniswap today stopped,</p>
<p>the Uniswap smart contract would continue to operate</p>
<p>on the Ethereum blockchain.</p>
<p>Similarly for like a borrowing and lending marketplace,</p>
<p>like somebody in India wants to borrow</p>
<p>from somebody in the US or whatever,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s very difficult to do that</p>
<p>in the traditional financial world,</p>
<p>but in a smart contract that&rsquo;s decentralized,</p>
<p>you can enable anybody to access it.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s really kind of this great democratizing force</p>
<p>that is creating a new financial system</p>
<p>that is more fair and more free.</p>
<p>Yeah, and in some ways it&rsquo;s a clever way</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s enabling people to do that in a novel way.</p>
<p>So is Uniswap in some sense a competitive Coinbase?</p>
<p>In which way is it and which way is it not?</p>
<p>So because for people who don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>Coinbase is centralized.</p>
<p>So let me ask, doesn&rsquo;t that go against the spirit of crypto</p>
<p>since crypto is decentralized?</p>
<p>What are the pros and cons of being centralized</p>
<p>as an exchange?</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t think Coinbase is fully centralized.</p>
<p>We have many different products.</p>
<p>And the way that I think about it is that our exchange</p>
<p>or our brokerage is a centralized,</p>
<p>regulated financial service business.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s actually important for the crypto ecosystem</p>
<p>to have that because you wanna allow a lot of the fiat money</p>
<p>in the world to flow into the crypto economy.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re very proud of that.</p>
<p>And I think we&rsquo;ve helped a lot of that money flow in.</p>
<p>Now, once people have money in crypto,</p>
<p>they can choose to hold it in a variety of ways.</p>
<p>And they can choose to hold it in a self custodial wallet,</p>
<p>which is more decentralized.</p>
<p>They can choose to use decentralized exchanges,</p>
<p>which we love and Uniswap is not really,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think of them as like a direct competitor to us.</p>
<p>We basically have integrated Uniswap</p>
<p>into a number of our products.</p>
<p>We love DeFi, decentralized exchanges, the whole thing.</p>
<p>So Coinbase wallet, which is a self custodial wallet,</p>
<p>is more decentralized and it allows people</p>
<p>to hold their own crypto.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t have to trust us.</p>
<p>Can you explain what a self custodial wallet is?</p>
<p>What is a wallet and what is a self custodial wallet?</p>
<p>Yeah, so it&rsquo;s confusing.</p>
<p>So a custodial wallet means you&rsquo;re trusting Coinbase</p>
<p>to store your crypto, the private keys themselves.</p>
<p>And for some people and institutions and everything,</p>
<p>just meeting them where they are today,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s nice because it&rsquo;s simpler.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not afraid of losing their crypto</p>
<p>if they make some accidental mistake.</p>
<p>Or so custodial crypto products are important</p>
<p>to help get a bunch of people into the ecosystem.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m very supportive of self custodial wallets.</p>
<p>And I think in some ways they are the future</p>
<p>because more and more people are gonna want</p>
<p>to store their own crypto,</p>
<p>not trust a third party institution to do it.</p>
<p>And in some ways that is much more authentic</p>
<p>to the ethos of crypto.</p>
<p>So Coinbase will help you convert the fiat into crypto.</p>
<p>And frankly, that&rsquo;s a more centralized thing.</p>
<p>But once you have crypto,</p>
<p>you can then go to the self custodial world,</p>
<p>store it yourself.</p>
<p>And to get into the technical details just for a second,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s basically saying you&rsquo;re gonna store the keys</p>
<p>on your own device.</p>
<p>And so even if Coinbase gets some court order to seize it,</p>
<p>we actually can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>From an architecture point of view, we can&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>Or if Coinbase gets hacked or something,</p>
<p>we can&rsquo;t lose your funds.</p>
<p>Now the thing is you have to take the responsibility</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re not taking it.</p>
<p>So the individual person could get hacked.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a whole bunch of really cool research happening</p>
<p>to make self custodial wallets more resilient</p>
<p>to accidental loss, hacks, and just user error.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how much you&rsquo;ve looked at various cryptography</p>
<p>things, but basically, you can have multiple signatures</p>
<p>from different keys on different devices</p>
<p>where you need two of the three or three of the five.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a whole technology called multi party computation</p>
<p>or threshold signing signatures, which is really cool.</p>
<p>But those are the things you would run locally?</p>
<p>These are all security measures, cryptography measures</p>
<p>to protect you without a centralized component?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So a simple example would be, let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>say you had a two of three key signature.</p>
<p>And one key might be stored at Coinbase,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s not a quorum.</p>
<p>So we couldn&rsquo;t unilaterally move your funds.</p>
<p>But another key is on your device, on your phone,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say.</p>
<p>Oh, cool.</p>
<p>So in a normal situation, you have a key on your phone.</p>
<p>We have one.</p>
<p>And so two out of three, it can all</p>
<p>get signed very quickly for day to day use.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s say you lose your phone or something.</p>
<p>Now, there has to be a third key.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where you could store it in a backup somewhere,</p>
<p>like in Google Drive or iCloud.</p>
<p>You could trust a third party that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not Coinbase to also have that one key.</p>
<p>And they can&rsquo;t do anything unilaterally with that one key.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a simple example.</p>
<p>You can get way more complicated.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s an awesome idea.</p>
<p>So if your funds get seized, Coinbase can&rsquo;t do anything.</p>
<p>But you better not lose your phone, maybe, in that case.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>But it provides a, there is, so even if you lose your phone,</p>
<p>then there is a recovery mechanism.</p>
<p>Because you can get the one key from Coinbase,</p>
<p>the one from your backup provider,</p>
<p>and recover a new one back on your phone.</p>
<p>I know, yeah.</p>
<p>But what if Coinbase is no longer,</p>
<p>but because of government, because of, say,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s in North Korea, government says you&rsquo;re no longer,</p>
<p>like Coinbase is shut down in that country</p>
<p>or something like that.</p>
<p>Then you can get it, even if you have access to those two.</p>
<p>So again, perhaps a silly question,</p>
<p>but isn&rsquo;t a self custodial wallet a competitor</p>
<p>as a notion to Coinbase?</p>
<p>No, I mean, so we offer a self custodial wallet.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve built one, and it&rsquo;s like one.</p>
<p>But doesn&rsquo;t it bleed the, like I guess</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m asking a sort of a financial question,</p>
<p>is like how does Coinbase make money on transactions?</p>
<p>So does this not, it does not decrease the number,</p>
<p>or does not significantly negatively affect transactions?</p>
<p>Or are you more focused on growing the number of the pie</p>
<p>of the number of people that are using cryptocurrency?</p>
<p>Yeah, like a traditional financial service firm</p>
<p>would probably say, well, we should be storing,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s keep more of the custody with us,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s how we prove to the world</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re valuable or whatever.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really believe that.</p>
<p>Like I think that actually we kind of want to encourage</p>
<p>our users to move to self custody over time</p>
<p>for those who are ready and willing.</p>
<p>And that technology needs to mature.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not trying to like force anybody to do it</p>
<p>who doesn&rsquo;t want to do it.</p>
<p>But to me, that&rsquo;s like the future</p>
<p>of how we get billions of people using crypto.</p>
<p>But doesn&rsquo;t that mean they can go somewhere else easier?</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s sort of the point is like,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re all using the same protocol.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s low switching costs,</p>
<p>which keeps all the companies accountable, right?</p>
<p>Like if you want to access the visa network,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s only one company in the world</p>
<p>you can go through to do that, like visa.</p>
<p>But if you want to access the Bitcoin network,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s dozens or hundreds of companies out there</p>
<p>who can do that.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s arguably, you could argue it&rsquo;s worse for us</p>
<p>as a company, but I think it&rsquo;s better for,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s what makes Bitcoin interesting</p>
<p>and cryptocurrency interesting is that nobody controls it.</p>
<p>There is low switching costs for customers.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s better for customers.</p>
<p>And that means that all the companies in the space</p>
<p>are going to be held to a high standard</p>
<p>because the minute you lose someone&rsquo;s trust,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re just going to move their Bitcoin to some other service</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s good for the world.</p>
<p>Do you think of Coinbase as,</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s these ideas of layer one,</p>
<p>layer two, layer three technologies.</p>
<p>Do you think of Coinbase as layer one,</p>
<p>layer two, layer three?</p>
<p>Now that said, there&rsquo;s so many products</p>
<p>that are under the Coinbase umbrella</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s hard to answer that question,</p>
<p>but what do you think?</p>
<p>Do you acknowledge the existence of layer three?</p>
<p>So, you know, usually when people are using those terms,</p>
<p>layer one, layer two, so they&rsquo;re referring to like,</p>
<p>layer one would be the blockchain,</p>
<p>layer one blockchain itself,</p>
<p>like a Bitcoin or Ethereum or something,</p>
<p>not like a centralized service like Coinbase</p>
<p>or even our decentralized self custodial wallet.</p>
<p>So yeah, I wouldn&rsquo;t consider us to be like a layer one.</p>
<p>These are the decentralized protocols</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re integrating, but Coinbase itself is not those.</p>
<p>Yes, but layer two is the thing that was basically</p>
<p>doing transactions without the settlement on the blockchain.</p>
<p>And so you get to have some of the benefits</p>
<p>of faster transactions without the security</p>
<p>associated with the blockchain.</p>
<p>And layer three is, I suppose,</p>
<p>sort of apps built on top of that.</p>
<p>So, you know, at least I think talking to Michael Saylor,</p>
<p>he considers Coinbase a layer three technology.</p>
<p>Interesting, okay.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not really particularly familiar</p>
<p>with this kind of distinction of layer three and two.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see them as fundamentally different.</p>
<p>But some of the, okay, I mean, one way of asking that,</p>
<p>is there some layer two like of magic happening</p>
<p>in order to make transactions associated</p>
<p>with the blockchain happen instant, so that they&rsquo;re quick?</p>
<p>So that.</p>
<p>On Coinbase?</p>
<p>On Coinbase, yeah.</p>
<p>Is there some magic going on?</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;re, okay, we should say,</p>
<p>how many cryptocurrencies are currently on Coinbase?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s more than two.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a lot more than two.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So you have to understand,</p>
<p>they have to incorporate all these technologies.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So how do you make that magic</p>
<p>of sort of universal transactions happen</p>
<p>across all of these different cryptocurrencies?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s our centralized products</p>
<p>and decentralized products, right?</p>
<p>The centralized products, we are storing that crypto for you.</p>
<p>And so if you&rsquo;re moving from one of your accounts</p>
<p>to another account, like an ETH1 account to ETH2 account,</p>
<p>or from my ETH Coinbase centralized account</p>
<p>to your ETH centralized.</p>
<p>So we can do that transaction off chain to make it faster.</p>
<p>And it saves the customer fees</p>
<p>and it just confirms instantly.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not truly using the decentralized blockchain,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>So you can also send any Bitcoin address</p>
<p>or Ethereum address, for instance.</p>
<p>And that is putting the transaction on chain.</p>
<p>Now our decentralized products like Coinbase wallet,</p>
<p>the self custodial wallet,</p>
<p>every transaction is happening on chain with that.</p>
<p>And so basically it just shows a little bit</p>
<p>of the evolution of Coinbase and the blockchains themselves.</p>
<p>Like in the early days, these networks were not scalable.</p>
<p>And so there were no L2 solutions, for instance.</p>
<p>And so we had to do sort of these hacks,</p>
<p>like moving the crypto off chain,</p>
<p>if you were moving between your own accounts</p>
<p>and stuff like that.</p>
<p>Otherwise the minor fees would have just eaten us alive</p>
<p>as a company, right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But now the blockchains are starting to scale.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a whole bunch of more work</p>
<p>that needs to be done on that.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re getting L2 solutions.</p>
<p>So I think more and more of the transactions</p>
<p>are going on chain, whether it&rsquo;s L2, L1.</p>
<p>And ideally we shouldn&rsquo;t be doing that many transactions</p>
<p>off chain, just internal Coinbase ledger or something.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not really in the spirit of crypto.</p>
<p>So when you say on chain, that includes layer two technology</p>
<p>that the blockchain proposes.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I guess I was asking how much fun magic is happening</p>
<p>off chain within Coinbase.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re saying in the early days you had to,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re trying to do less and less.</p>
<p>So look, there&rsquo;s a bunch of high frequency traders</p>
<p>that use the centralized products</p>
<p>and even just regular retail people,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t want to pay the gas fees and stuff.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re trying to, it actually,</p>
<p>we back at the envelope, calculated this out at one point</p>
<p>and just like, it would be completely infeasible</p>
<p>for like high frequency traders</p>
<p>to put everything on chain at this point.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s basically what DEXs are doing.</p>
<p>And so both are important.</p>
<p>I think more and more is going to move decentralized</p>
<p>over time, which is great.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re, and we&rsquo;re basically.</p>
<p>DEXs are decentralized exchanges by the way.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So anyway, we want to encourage more and more of it</p>
<p>to move decentralized over time,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t, the centralized things aren&rsquo;t going away</p>
<p>for like a long time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a decade from now,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s going to be some big institution</p>
<p>or pension fund or central bank.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like, all right, we got to hold crypto.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s set up the account in a centralized way.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>Both, both are important.</p>
<p>Do you know the number</p>
<p>of cryptocurrencies currently on Coinbase?</p>
<p>Do you know that number?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s over a hundred, but it depends.</p>
<p>It depends what jurisdiction you&rsquo;re in.</p>
<p>And, you know, are you in institution versus retail?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s like, there&rsquo;s so many different categories now.</p>
<p>But over a hundred.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So what does it take to become, to, to, to become an asset,</p>
<p>to become a cryptocurrency on Coinbase,</p>
<p>to add your technology to Coinbase?</p>
<p>Okay. Well, so we&rsquo;re trying to get away from this idea</p>
<p>of being listed on Coinbase as being seen as like</p>
<p>an endorsement or something,</p>
<p>because I actually think it&rsquo;s very important</p>
<p>that we are not considered judge and jury about, you know,</p>
<p>like imagine it was the early days of the internet</p>
<p>and you were like, what&rsquo;s a good webpage</p>
<p>and what&rsquo;s a bad webpage.</p>
<p>Like you would have been totally wrong</p>
<p>or anytime big tech companies try to make these review,</p>
<p>review boards of like, you know,</p>
<p>Apple famously gets in trouble for this a lot</p>
<p>with their app store review process.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And so something that you think like a committee of people</p>
<p>somewhere thinks looks silly may turn out</p>
<p>to be the next big thing.</p>
<p>Right. And so it&rsquo;s very difficult.</p>
<p>So what do we do?</p>
<p>We basically have a test of legality, right?</p>
<p>We check, you know, do we believe this is a security?</p>
<p>If so, it can&rsquo;t be listed on Coinbase</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a very rigorous process we go through for that.</p>
<p>Just currently the way the laws are in the US,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve been, we acquired a broker duo license</p>
<p>from the SEC.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re trying to work with them to get that operational</p>
<p>and hopefully someday we can trade real crypto securities.</p>
<p>But today that&rsquo;s not possible in the US at least.</p>
<p>Then we look at sort of the cybersecurity</p>
<p>of the crypto asset.</p>
<p>Does it, do we see that there&rsquo;s some flaw</p>
<p>in the smart contract or, you know,</p>
<p>a way that somebody could manipulate it</p>
<p>without the customer&rsquo;s permission?</p>
<p>We look at some compliance pieces to it as well,</p>
<p>like the actors behind it and like, you know,</p>
<p>there any kind of criminal history, anything like that.</p>
<p>But if we believe it meets our listing standards,</p>
<p>basically this test of legality and everything</p>
<p>for customer protection, then we want to list it</p>
<p>because we want the market to at that point decide.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s kind of like Amazon or something like that</p>
<p>where, you know, a product might have three stars</p>
<p>or it might have five stars,</p>
<p>but if it starts to get one star consistently,</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s probably a fraudulent or it&rsquo;s defective</p>
<p>or something like maybe Amazon will remove it.</p>
<p>But otherwise you want to let the market decide</p>
<p>what these things are.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s generally how we do it.</p>
<p>And by the way, more and more of these assets,</p>
<p>I think especially like low market cap assets</p>
<p>are going to be traded on DEXs through Coinbase.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that we,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t need to list every asset on a centralized exchange.</p>
<p>I think DEXs are really good for the long tail.</p>
<p>And then it becomes an even,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s even more clear to people,</p>
<p>like this is not some endorsement by a Coinbase of like,</p>
<p>this asset&rsquo;s good and this one&rsquo;s bad.</p>
<p>Like, you know, my belief is there&rsquo;s going to be millions</p>
<p>of these assets over time.</p>
<p>And so I hope it doesn&rsquo;t like make news</p>
<p>every time we add one in the future, basically.</p>
<p>Yeah, I wonder how you get there</p>
<p>because I, even I look to Coinbase for, for example,</p>
<p>you know, people, as you can imagine,</p>
<p>sort of tag me on Twitter or something like that</p>
<p>and all that, like you should interview our sort of this,</p>
<p>the founder of this particular coin, right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And I, it&rsquo;s so hard for me to know what&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>first of all, what&rsquo;s interesting technology?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s, who&rsquo;s a scammer or not?</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s actually legitimately representing</p>
<p>an ambitious new thing versus a scam?</p>
<p>And I, you know, there&rsquo;s very few sources</p>
<p>of like a verification signal.</p>
<p>And unfortunately Coinbase in part</p>
<p>has become a little bit of that too.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re trying to get away from that</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re trying to get as many,</p>
<p>sort of let the people decide.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re thinking of like Amazon star type system</p>
<p>where the people could rate.</p>
<p>Yeah, so I think we&rsquo;ll actually probably add</p>
<p>like user ratings and reviews.</p>
<p>So, and we&rsquo;ll be very cautious about like, you know,</p>
<p>these are real people.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a bunch of stuff we have to do for that already.</p>
<p>So I think wisdom of the crowds is good</p>
<p>in terms of getting feedback on items,</p>
<p>but we also, we&rsquo;re gonna do our own review,</p>
<p>which I mentioned earlier, right?</p>
<p>Which is like, okay, it meets this minimum bar</p>
<p>to be listed on our site.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I think, yeah, both are important.</p>
<p>How do you know if a coin is a scam or not?</p>
<p>Well, you can see a few things.</p>
<p>So, you know, I hate to use the word scam</p>
<p>because a lot of these are judgment calls.</p>
<p>You gotta, I kind of, a court may or a jury</p>
<p>may land either way,</p>
<p>but things that would be red flags to look at would be,</p>
<p>you know, is a bunch of the asset owned by an insider</p>
<p>or insiders with short vesting periods.</p>
<p>You know, does the background of the founders,</p>
<p>like they may have criminal records</p>
<p>or if they&rsquo;ve perpetrated other frauds in the past, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a difference between something</p>
<p>which is just a me too product.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, it doesn&rsquo;t have anything interesting about it</p>
<p>and something that&rsquo;s an actual fraud or outright scam.</p>
<p>And you have to, a lot of this data,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s cool about it is that it&rsquo;s now available on chain.</p>
<p>You can look at like the tokenomics behind it</p>
<p>and see who owns it.</p>
<p>And are they selling it, you know, in like inappropriately</p>
<p>or are they pumping it on like YouTube and Twitter</p>
<p>and making promises about,</p>
<p>hey, the value of this thing may be a higher in the future.</p>
<p>And like, all those are just big, big no, no&rsquo;s</p>
<p>that we would, you know, we just don&rsquo;t wanna go there.</p>
<p>So our whole thing is like,</p>
<p>we want to enable innovation in this space,</p>
<p>but not allow anybody to curtail the advancement</p>
<p>of this industry by like doing some kind of fraudulent thing</p>
<p>or get rich quick thing.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a tricky industry</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m trying to figure out who to, you know,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s interesting to understand, to research.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s hard to know.</p>
<p>Let me ask you about a tricky one</p>
<p>to add to a centralized exchange,</p>
<p>which is privacy preserving cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>So like Monero.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Is that technically difficult or is that why,</p>
<p>why is like Monero, for example, forget that specific one,</p>
<p>but like privacy preserving cryptocurrency blockchains,</p>
<p>why is that, is that ever possible to add?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a great question.</p>
<p>So the answer is maybe.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s the reason why.</p>
<p>So because we&rsquo;re a regulated financial service business,</p>
<p>we have various licenses to do that.</p>
<p>We are regulated by various regulators.</p>
<p>Part of those licenses requires us to have a quote,</p>
<p>reasonable program to monitor for suspicious activity,</p>
<p>you know, an AML program, anti money laundering, right?</p>
<p>And so if it, if a coin is a hundred percent anonymous</p>
<p>and we can&rsquo;t really do blockchain analytics</p>
<p>to track source of funds</p>
<p>and where these things might be going,</p>
<p>it makes it harder to have a reasonable program around that</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s defensible.</p>
<p>Now there are privacy preserving coins like Zcash,</p>
<p>which have something called a view key.</p>
<p>And a view key is basically another key</p>
<p>which allows you to deanonymize the transactions</p>
<p>in specific situations where you want that.</p>
<p>So for instance, you know, we do support Zcash.</p>
<p>And one of the ways we got comfortable with that</p>
<p>is that when you&rsquo;re buying it on Coinbase,</p>
<p>you know, you can basically have a view key.</p>
<p>The transactions are not anonymous while you&rsquo;re buying it.</p>
<p>And we can see where it goes afterwards</p>
<p>and do our whole standard program.</p>
<p>Now, if it gets a few hops away down the road,</p>
<p>I mean, people could eventually turn on</p>
<p>privacy preserving aspects.</p>
<p>So, you know, these are tough judgment calls,</p>
<p>but at least in terms of our interaction</p>
<p>with the customer and everything,</p>
<p>we feel comfortable at that.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a broader point here,</p>
<p>which is that I actually think privacy coins</p>
<p>are a good thing for the world and they should be allowed.</p>
<p>And more like, you know, despite,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve made this judgment call to operate</p>
<p>in a regulated and safe and compliant way,</p>
<p>but just taking my Coinbase hat off for a minute,</p>
<p>I think the world would be a better place</p>
<p>if there were more privacy coins,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s kind of like the internet</p>
<p>when it first came online, like there was no HTTPS,</p>
<p>everything was HTTP and there was, you know,</p>
<p>so people were afraid to put their credit cards</p>
<p>on the internet and your messages could be intercepted</p>
<p>and all this stuff.</p>
<p>And now the whole internet has basically moved to HTTPS</p>
<p>with a little lock icon in your browser, which is better.</p>
<p>Like, and financial information</p>
<p>is like the most important information to keep private,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s times where like,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re running a charity or something</p>
<p>and you want to have total auditability,</p>
<p>transparency for the whole world,</p>
<p>who donated and where did the money go?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s great, you want it to be public.</p>
<p>But if it&rsquo;s like your personal money or something like that,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t want to be broadcasting that to the whole world.</p>
<p>And in some ways that&rsquo;s what blockchains are doing,</p>
<p>you know, pseudonymously,</p>
<p>because like, but it is a public ledger.</p>
<p>And so if you can know who owns each address,</p>
<p>you can basically deanonymize it.</p>
<p>I, you know, I think basically people should fight</p>
<p>for privacy and freedoms of all kinds,</p>
<p>but privacy of money is a good thing.</p>
<p>So I would like to see more of that in the future.</p>
<p>You chosen with Coinbase to have a seat at the table</p>
<p>with the regulators.</p>
<p>So what kind of conversations are there at that table?</p>
<p>What are the regulations like?</p>
<p>What is the level of understanding with regulators?</p>
<p>What are they worried about?</p>
<p>What are they thinking about?</p>
<p>What are the positive and what are the negative regulations</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re facing?</p>
<p>That you&rsquo;re educating, struggling with, pushing back on,</p>
<p>supporting, all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Oh man, there&rsquo;s so many.</p>
<p>Cause we&rsquo;re, I mean, we&rsquo;re live in like, you know,</p>
<p>maybe a hundred countries or more at this point.</p>
<p>So the conversations are all over the map.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to think what broad strokes I could paint for you.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;d say one trend that&rsquo;s positive is that basically</p>
<p>regulators around the world are more and more,</p>
<p>over the last five years, I would say,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s more and more common to find a regulator today asking,</p>
<p>how can we preserve the innovation potential</p>
<p>of this technology while keeping the bad actors out</p>
<p>than it was five years ago, where they were saying,</p>
<p>this is all bad activity.</p>
<p>How do we prevent it?</p>
<p>And so maybe this is.</p>
<p>When you say more and more, what fraction?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give you like a US specific example,</p>
<p>although we operate in many countries.</p>
<p>So when I go to DC now, I would say, you know,</p>
<p>50, 60% of the people who I meet with are basically,</p>
<p>you know, they&rsquo;re in the camp of crypto,</p>
<p>has a lot of potential.</p>
<p>We should regulate it to make sure the bad people</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t do something bad with it.</p>
<p>But this is here to stay and it has a lot of upside.</p>
<p>We should basically create the awful regulation</p>
<p>and celebrate it and actually encourage this innovation</p>
<p>to happen in the US.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a huge change from just three years ago</p>
<p>where it was probably 30% of people saying that.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s like 60, it&rsquo;s like almost double.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s getting harder to find like true crypto skeptics</p>
<p>in DC.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say that, you know, maybe only like 20 or 30% of people</p>
<p>are like willing to say something negative.</p>
<p>Like they actually think it&rsquo;s net negative.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s really hard to defend that position</p>
<p>at this point, because almost like one in five Americans</p>
<p>have used or tried crypto at this point.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re kind of condemning 20% of your fellow citizens</p>
<p>if you say that at this point, you know,</p>
<p>especially with NFTs and all these things,</p>
<p>like a huge segment of people who don&rsquo;t even care</p>
<p>about investing or whatever came into the space.</p>
<p>So, and then basically that&rsquo;s that same conversation</p>
<p>is happening, but, you know, delayed by a few years</p>
<p>in like India and Europe and in some Asian countries.</p>
<p>And some countries have really embraced crypto</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re like trying to really,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re ahead of where the US is</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re trying to actually attract</p>
<p>the best startups and entrepreneurs like, you know, like Dubai</p>
<p>and UK and Australia and all are kind of pushing</p>
<p>good regulation, El Salvador actually, I guess,</p>
<p>adopted it as like Bitcoin as a legal tender.</p>
<p>There was another country, Central African Republic,</p>
<p>I think that is supposedly did that as well.</p>
<p>But, you know, there&rsquo;s countries like China</p>
<p>that are more autocratic that are saying,</p>
<p>hey, this is a threat to our power</p>
<p>and like, we&rsquo;re gonna try to really curtail it.</p>
<p>So what kind of regulations are there that you feel the most</p>
<p>that are limiting or that are empowering?</p>
<p>Like, is there specific examples?</p>
<p>Yeah, okay.</p>
<p>So, I mean, basically I think the securities laws</p>
<p>in the US need to be clarified about what,</p>
<p>crypto is many different things.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what people don&rsquo;t realize.</p>
<p>So like some crypto, like Bitcoin, Ethereum</p>
<p>and many others are probably more like commodities.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not controlled by any one person, you know,</p>
<p>like anyway, there&rsquo;s people who wanna raise money</p>
<p>for a company that&rsquo;s sounds more like a security</p>
<p>that should be regulated by the SEC.</p>
<p>Commodities are regulated by the CFTC.</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s some cryptocurrencies</p>
<p>which are more like currencies,</p>
<p>like stable coins and central bank digital currencies.</p>
<p>And those are probably, you know,</p>
<p>should be regulated by the treasury or someone like that.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s a whole another category</p>
<p>of cryptocurrencies, which are none of those things.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re NFTs like artwork or they&rsquo;re metaverse items</p>
<p>or decentralized identity and voting.</p>
<p>And so I think that there&rsquo;s a very unhelpful point of view</p>
<p>out there by some folks, which is,</p>
<p>hey, this is all, most of this is like bad activity.</p>
<p>We need to shut it down.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re just gonna pursue enforcement actions</p>
<p>or something like that.</p>
<p>Most people in DC don&rsquo;t feel that way anymore.</p>
<p>And I think the people of the US don&rsquo;t feel that way anymore</p>
<p>because a lot of them are using this stuff.</p>
<p>And their general view is,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of upside potential here.</p>
<p>We can all agree, let&rsquo;s get rid of the fraud and the scams.</p>
<p>We all wanna get rid of that.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s create a relatively simple test, which says,</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s like nobody controls more than 20% of it</p>
<p>or some threshold, it probably is more like a commodity.</p>
<p>If someone&rsquo;s raising money for,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re selling this thing for a business,</p>
<p>then it&rsquo;s probably a security.</p>
<p>And then if it&rsquo;s more like a medium of exchange,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a currency.</p>
<p>And if it&rsquo;s none of those things,</p>
<p>maybe it&rsquo;s artwork or whatever,</p>
<p>a legal test like that would help clarify who,</p>
<p>which regulator is regulating what.</p>
<p>And then we also wanna have probably like a sandbox</p>
<p>for innovation where if you&rsquo;re a startup</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re doing less than, I don&rsquo;t know, some number,</p>
<p>less than some amount of payment volume</p>
<p>or customer funds you&rsquo;re storing,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like just let those things get off the ground</p>
<p>without a soul crushing amount of legal bills</p>
<p>and uncertainty.</p>
<p>So if the US can get there, that would be great.</p>
<p>I think a bunch of other countries now are rushing</p>
<p>around the world to sort of create that regulation</p>
<p>that does attract innovation.</p>
<p>And so in the international bodies like IMF and G20</p>
<p>and stuff, they&rsquo;re starting to look at proposed regulation.</p>
<p>I hope that Coinbase and a bunch of other crypto companies</p>
<p>can help in that conversation too.</p>
<p>We have a whole policy effort.</p>
<p>I think actually crypto policy efforts</p>
<p>are like probably one of the biggest things</p>
<p>in DC right now.</p>
<p>So it moves slow at the speed of government,</p>
<p>but yeah, and in the meantime,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re just trying to help more and more people use crypto</p>
<p>because ultimately that&rsquo;s what, in the democracies,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what they care about.</p>
<p>Like they&rsquo;ll do what the people of the country want.</p>
<p>So you want governments to start understanding</p>
<p>differences between, in the crypto space,</p>
<p>commodities, securities, currencies, NFTs.</p>
<p>I still don&rsquo;t understand.</p>
<p>What are they supposed to make sense of NFTs?</p>
<p>What is NFTs exactly from a perspective of a regulator?</p>
<p>Yeah, so.</p>
<p>Is it the other categories?</p>
<p>Yeah, most NFTs you could think of as like artwork,</p>
<p>although it&rsquo;s, who knows where it&rsquo;s gonna go.</p>
<p>It could be.</p>
<p>You mentioned Metaverse, right?</p>
<p>You mentioned some kind of unique identity of a thing.</p>
<p>Yeah, like there&rsquo;s people selling virtual land in NFTs.</p>
<p>I actually, I bought this NFT that&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like citizenship in this like city, Dow in Wyoming.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;ve never been there,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s almost like a badge or an attestation</p>
<p>like to get access to this location.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s like people doing like tickets to events.</p>
<p>Like, you know, they&rsquo;re called a POAPs.</p>
<p>Like proof of attendance and things like that.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;ll be very interesting to see where NFTs go over time.</p>
<p>It could get, and that&rsquo;s the danger.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t wanna try to like define the regulation</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t even know where this thing&rsquo;s gonna go, so.</p>
<p>And so your efforts in the policy arm is education?</p>
<p>Yeah, education, advocacy.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re just trying to be like a helpful educational resource</p>
<p>essentially, and then if they give us feedback</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re like, hey, don&rsquo;t do this or don&rsquo;t, or do this,</p>
<p>like we&rsquo;re more than happy to do anything that&rsquo;s requested.</p>
<p>We generally go get licenses</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ve just tried to do the right thing</p>
<p>in the absence of clarity,</p>
<p>because if it&rsquo;s not clear what the law says,</p>
<p>then you should just basically do good things</p>
<p>that you think may be required in the future</p>
<p>to show good faith effort towards the right thing.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s part of like innovating in a regulated field,</p>
<p>which is, you know, a whole topic in itself.</p>
<p>So if you are at the table,</p>
<p>let me, this is less the case in the United States,</p>
<p>but can government agencies seize a person&rsquo;s cryptocurrency</p>
<p>by forcing Coinbase to hand it over?</p>
<p>So when you&rsquo;re centralized,</p>
<p>they have a phone number to call.</p>
<p>Okay, so this is a complicated topic.</p>
<p>Like if you really wanna be sure that,</p>
<p>this is why people wanna store their own crypto, right?</p>
<p>Like with self custodial wallets,</p>
<p>like with Coinbase wallet embracing decentralization,</p>
<p>they wanna avoid that.</p>
<p>Now in the US, there is rule of law, right?</p>
<p>So we have reasonable protections in place around</p>
<p>like search and seizure and things like that.</p>
<p>You know, Coinbase does,</p>
<p>we publish transparency reports on this.</p>
<p>We get subpoenas, court orders, things like that</p>
<p>from various countries around the world.</p>
<p>And there are situations where we have been ordered</p>
<p>to freeze accounts, things like that.</p>
<p>You know, we have to follow the law,</p>
<p>is another way to put it.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re a regulated financial service business and so.</p>
<p>If the money is used as part of breaking the law,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what that, in a particular jurisdiction,</p>
<p>in a particular.</p>
<p>Right, and then the other thing,</p>
<p>sometimes we will actually get court orders</p>
<p>or subpoenas that are overly broad.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve seen, so they need to follow due process, right?</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;ve seen some in the past that were like,</p>
<p>well, we need you to freeze this huge number of accounts.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, well, we&rsquo;ll actually have gone to court</p>
<p>and like pushed back on some of these and said like,</p>
<p>what is your probable cause?</p>
<p>And has the threshold been met?</p>
<p>And like, we&rsquo;ve won some of those cases</p>
<p>on behalf of our customers.</p>
<p>So yeah, it&rsquo;s actually really,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of unfortunate and frustrating.</p>
<p>As a large business, you spend a lot of resources</p>
<p>basically interacting with inbound requests</p>
<p>by all kinds of lawyers and people and requesting things.</p>
<p>And some of them are silly and ridiculous</p>
<p>and you have to push back and say no.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s kind of a tax on every company at a certain size</p>
<p>which ultimately gets passed on to the customer</p>
<p>in higher fees.</p>
<p>So you have to employ armies of lawyers</p>
<p>to deal with this stuff.</p>
<p>Can you educate me on something?</p>
<p>How much innovation is there in the legal space?</p>
<p>So for lawyers working with Coinbase</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s such a new cutting edge thing.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re, there&rsquo;s a lot of gray area</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re supposed to be operating under.</p>
<p>Like how hard is it being a lawyer at Coinbase?</p>
<p>Like how much precedence is there?</p>
<p>I guess is what I&rsquo;m asking.</p>
<p>I mean, just like you said, three years.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of a new space.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, it&rsquo;s probably very hard</p>
<p>to be a lawyer at Coinbase and very fun</p>
<p>because whenever you&rsquo;re in a new field that&rsquo;s growing fast,</p>
<p>there isn&rsquo;t a lot of case law and just precedent set.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s also an opportunity for you</p>
<p>to go create that stuff.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what a lot of legal careers are made out of</p>
<p>is like take a complex situation</p>
<p>where you have to balance difficult things.</p>
<p>Like how do we prevent bad activity</p>
<p>but still enable an innovation?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a hard question.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s, you can go draft legislation</p>
<p>and circulate it to policymakers</p>
<p>or come up with these policies</p>
<p>and how do you operate a business in an environment</p>
<p>where the law is just unclear, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like try to do the right thing,</p>
<p>but like strike the right balance.</p>
<p>So yeah, a lot of our lawyers have to come up with that.</p>
<p>Very creative stuff.</p>
<p>You mentioned one of the things you&rsquo;re focused on</p>
<p>is expanding the number of people,</p>
<p>maybe a billion people on Coinbase or using cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>Where are we at now?</p>
<p>How do we get to a billion?</p>
<p>As of Q4 last year,</p>
<p>we had 89 million verified accounts on Coinbase,</p>
<p>but in any given quarter, only maybe like 10</p>
<p>or a little more million of those are like really active.</p>
<p>So, and then if you look at globally,</p>
<p>I think some of the estimates I&rsquo;ve seen</p>
<p>is maybe there&rsquo;s like 200 million people</p>
<p>or something like that who have ever used or tried crypto.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re a long, you know, we&rsquo;re ways from a billion,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not like that far off.</p>
<p>How do you get there?</p>
<p>How do you get to a billion?</p>
<p>So a few things.</p>
<p>One is the blockchains have got to become</p>
<p>way more scalable.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of like we&rsquo;re all running dial up modems</p>
<p>and we need broadband.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s just like too expensive, too slow</p>
<p>to do all these transactions.</p>
<p>And I think if we just get L2s working and scalability,</p>
<p>you know, we&rsquo;ll see another order of magnitude</p>
<p>kind of come out just from that.</p>
<p>I think the second one would be more clear regulation.</p>
<p>That would help a lot.</p>
<p>I do talk to, you know, pension funds</p>
<p>and you know, various asset managers,</p>
<p>sovereign wealth funds and stuff.</p>
<p>And a lot of them tell me,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve got 1% of our portfolio in crypto today,</p>
<p>but we really would rather have like 20% in there.</p>
<p>But what we&rsquo;re waiting for is more clear regulation</p>
<p>coming out and saying that clear test that I was saying,</p>
<p>these assets are commodities regulated by SCPC,</p>
<p>these are by SCC, these are by treasury, whatever.</p>
<p>So that would be a big unlock.</p>
<p>Do transactions.</p>
<p>So one of the things that you mentioned, payments, sorry.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, does that unlock a lot of users?</p>
<p>Yeah, it does.</p>
<p>I mean, remittance is like a huge thing.</p>
<p>People sending money home to their families</p>
<p>in other countries where the fees are super high.</p>
<p>So yeah, if we get blockchains to be more scalable</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s more global adoption,</p>
<p>like I think we&rsquo;ll see remittance quarters</p>
<p>move over to crypto a lot.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also just,</p>
<p>the other thing that&rsquo;s driving a lot of crypto adoption</p>
<p>is basically the creation of more and more third party apps.</p>
<p>So, or dApps they&rsquo;re sometimes called decentralized dApps.</p>
<p>So a lot of startups now, you know,</p>
<p>how like you used to use in the early 2000s,</p>
<p>they called them.com startups,</p>
<p>but now you don&rsquo;t need to say.com</p>
<p>cause everybody&rsquo;s using the internet.</p>
<p>And so now there&rsquo;s like hundreds or thousands</p>
<p>of these crypto startups,</p>
<p>but I think in the future,</p>
<p>you won&rsquo;t need to call them crypto startups</p>
<p>cause they&rsquo;ll just be called startups</p>
<p>cause everyone&rsquo;s using the internet and crypto and whatever.</p>
<p>So anyway, the use cases,</p>
<p>the utility of crypto is getting better and better</p>
<p>with like all these third party apps</p>
<p>getting funded and created.</p>
<p>And do you think there&rsquo;s going to be a killer</p>
<p>or a set of killer dApps,</p>
<p>like a thing where nobody can live without?</p>
<p>Are we still waiting for that?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s going to be a bunch of them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like, it&rsquo;s like the internet,</p>
<p>like what were the killer web companies, you know,</p>
<p>like Uber and Wikipedia and Airbnb and Google.</p>
<p>And like, so there&rsquo;s going to be some big winners,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;ll be thousands of,</p>
<p>this is basically the new,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like what happened with the.com startups</p>
<p>in the early 2000s.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a lot of the best entrepreneurs</p>
<p>are building crypto startups now.</p>
<p>So tons of venture money flowing into the space.</p>
<p>A lot of smart young people, so.</p>
<p>Do you think Bitcoin or some other cryptocurrency</p>
<p>will become the reserve currency of the world at some point?</p>
<p>Cause this is kind of a controversial idea,</p>
<p>but I actually think yes.</p>
<p>I do think Bitcoin could end up becoming</p>
<p>a reserve currency of the world.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve been reading Ray Dalio recently</p>
<p>with his new book, like The Changing World Order.</p>
<p>And I thought it was a really well researched book.</p>
<p>He talks in there, he looks back at history, right?</p>
<p>He looks at like empires and going back</p>
<p>to various Chinese empires, the Dutch and Ottomans</p>
<p>and everybody, and how did they rise?</p>
<p>And they were able to have the reserve currency</p>
<p>as they rose and what produced that?</p>
<p>Like it came from good education and innovation</p>
<p>and better trade and anyway.</p>
<p>So the US by some measures is kind of looks like it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>maybe it&rsquo;s had a really good run</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s coming down a little bit</p>
<p>and China is kind of coming up.</p>
<p>Who knows how that&rsquo;ll play out, by the way,</p>
<p>like the world is very complicated.</p>
<p>It could, that could switch.</p>
<p>But I guess if the US dollar is gonna be seeing</p>
<p>more inflation in the future,</p>
<p>the Chinese Yuan is not like necessarily better, right?</p>
<p>I mean, they have a ton of debt as well.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not like you could really,</p>
<p>that the Yuan could be inflated as well, right?</p>
<p>It probably will be.</p>
<p>And so I do think that there&rsquo;s this group of people today</p>
<p>which probably most traditional, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>like the people who run big banks</p>
<p>and like governments and stuff that they&rsquo;re not,</p>
<p>this is not really on their radar today.</p>
<p>But I think there&rsquo;s basically a group of younger people</p>
<p>in that kind of 25, 35 year old range who are tech savvy.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re starting to think of crypto as like</p>
<p>the primary thing in their financial life.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, I basically hold my wealth in crypto</p>
<p>and I use dollars or euros or whatever.</p>
<p>If I happen to need something,</p>
<p>I convert it to that at the last minute.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, if I&rsquo;m traveling,</p>
<p>I might convert some local currency in the moment,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s not where I hold most of my wealth.</p>
<p>So this segment of the population is not like massive yet</p>
<p>from a GDP point of view,</p>
<p>but I think it&rsquo;s a leading indicator</p>
<p>of where things could be going.</p>
<p>And this is actually good for the world.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of like, especially if China does continue</p>
<p>to rise and it has a more authoritarian view,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll be kind of this very centralized East</p>
<p>versus a decentralized West where people are in the West,</p>
<p>in the free world, really kind of embracing crypto</p>
<p>and a more open, fair, free global financial system,</p>
<p>which I think will be enormously beneficial for humanity.</p>
<p>And I do think basically Bitcoin is the reserve currency,</p>
<p>the gold standard of the crypto economy.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s pretty crazy.</p>
<p>Yeah, the gold standard.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s also like with Ray Dalio,</p>
<p>I feel like China will drive a lot of this,</p>
<p>either in response or directly.</p>
<p>I mean, I think the ruble,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not paying as close attention to the financial systems,</p>
<p>but I think they&rsquo;re trying to tie it to gold once again.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s an interesting,</p>
<p>maybe it&rsquo;ll be one of the more authoritarian regime</p>
<p>that will switch to Bitcoin standard first.</p>
<p>And then it&rsquo;s the West that will,</p>
<p>out of that pressure will catch up</p>
<p>versus the other way around.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fascinating to think of what is the forcing function,</p>
<p>what kind of perturbation is required to switch,</p>
<p>to change anything, honestly, about the financial system.</p>
<p>But it could be, as you&rsquo;re saying,</p>
<p>just waiting for the people that are young now</p>
<p>that are embracing crypto</p>
<p>to enter the positions of power, essentially.</p>
<p>But I hope that&rsquo;s not the case,</p>
<p>because if for any innovation we have to wait,</p>
<p>sorry to say, for the older folk to pass away,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not an efficient way to make change.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s a super interesting topic</p>
<p>of how people&rsquo;s minds become less plastic as they age.</p>
<p>I guess it&rsquo;s a feature.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called wisdom,</p>
<p>but then we also need the wild ones to explore,</p>
<p>exploration versus exploitation.</p>
<p>You wrote a blog post that&rsquo;s really interesting</p>
<p>in September 2020 titled</p>
<p>Coinbase is a Mission Focused Company,</p>
<p>like what we&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>So one interesting thing you said in that blog post</p>
<p>is that we&rsquo;re not going to be distracted</p>
<p>by activism within the company</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not related to the mission of the company.</p>
<p>Now, that&rsquo;s a rare thing for a company to state,</p>
<p>for a company CEO to state, especially in this climate.</p>
<p>Can you, first of all,</p>
<p>describe in a little more detail what you meant?</p>
<p>Did you receive blowback for this?</p>
<p>I definitely received some blowback,</p>
<p>but yeah, I&rsquo;ll describe what I meant.</p>
<p>And if you want to talk about how it came to that too,</p>
<p>we can talk about that.</p>
<p>But what I meant is that there&rsquo;s a lot of companies right now,</p>
<p>including tech companies, but not exclusively,</p>
<p>where I think like great companies,</p>
<p>they have an important mission.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re trying to do something really good for the world.</p>
<p>And unfortunately, they&rsquo;re getting a little distracted</p>
<p>from that at times because of employee activism</p>
<p>that is causing the company to basically jump</p>
<p>into whatever the current thing is</p>
<p>and try to help is like the positive interpretation.</p>
<p>The negative interpretation would be to virtue signal.</p>
<p>And my view is that this is actually kind of destructive to,</p>
<p>this is largely an American company phenomenon, by the way.</p>
<p>I do worry that this is making America less competitive,</p>
<p>even though I think of myself</p>
<p>as kind of internationally minded,</p>
<p>but I am a US citizen, had my whole life here.</p>
<p>So when we put out this statement,</p>
<p>we had employees that were not in the US</p>
<p>who were confused by it.</p>
<p>They were like, why did Brian need to say that?</p>
<p>It was just saying you&rsquo;re going to focus on work at work.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what we were doing already.</p>
<p>And there was certain pockets of the US, certain cities,</p>
<p>in particular where we had employees</p>
<p>that a very peculiar cultural phenomenon had evolved</p>
<p>where I think people really wanted the company</p>
<p>they worked at to be almost acting</p>
<p>like the government or something</p>
<p>and like trying to solve the hardest societal issues</p>
<p>and at least have an opinion on it,</p>
<p>if not contribute to the solution</p>
<p>on almost everything.</p>
<p>And for me, it was a very uncomfortable situation</p>
<p>for me as a CEO.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d never quite been in this situation</p>
<p>where most of the time when employees in the past</p>
<p>were kind of asking me questions,</p>
<p>they would be asking about like,</p>
<p>how do we make this product better?</p>
<p>Like, what do we do with this competitor?</p>
<p>What about this regulator?</p>
<p>And it got to a place around that time</p>
<p>where most of the questions we were receiving</p>
<p>were I think even about things not related to the company</p>
<p>they were about broader societal issues.</p>
<p>Like Brian, what&rsquo;s your stance on XYZ controversial thing?</p>
<p>And it was, I often like didn&rsquo;t have an opinion</p>
<p>on these really hard questions, right?</p>
<p>And I didn&rsquo;t really,</p>
<p>I felt like it was distracting the company.</p>
<p>People internally were getting into fights a lot too,</p>
<p>like disagreeing with each other.</p>
<p>There was a thing where like the social slack internally</p>
<p>was turning into a social media almost</p>
<p>with people putting in flame wars.</p>
<p>So, and this culminated by the way</p>
<p>with a walkout that happened in the company.</p>
<p>We had received like some demands from employee groups</p>
<p>about various things.</p>
<p>And there was like basically an antagonistic thing</p>
<p>with management and employee.</p>
<p>And I was like, we&rsquo;re all on the same team here.</p>
<p>If you wanna be antagonistic,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s do it with somebody else outside the company,</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re trying to improve the world in that dimension.</p>
<p>So yeah, eventually I was like, okay,</p>
<p>the company is not aligned on this.</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t feel, I don&rsquo;t like the job as CEO, frankly.</p>
<p>Like if the job is to come in here every day</p>
<p>and like have to squirm in front of like the most difficult</p>
<p>societal questions, I don&rsquo;t think I wanna do that job.</p>
<p>So like either they&rsquo;re gonna have to go</p>
<p>or I&rsquo;m gonna have to go.</p>
<p>And I founded this company</p>
<p>and I really believe in the mission.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re gonna have to go.</p>
<p>And what I realized was that,</p>
<p>so I basically, I made an exit package available</p>
<p>to anybody who wasn&rsquo;t on board with this direction.</p>
<p>5% of employees took it.</p>
<p>I got the company realigned towards this mission.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re all here to do work.</p>
<p>By the way, people can, they can go do anything</p>
<p>like political or social activism outside of work.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s totally fine.</p>
<p>Like we all, everybody has stuff like that</p>
<p>in their personal life.</p>
<p>But while at work, we can also disagree at work,</p>
<p>by the way, on the work.</p>
<p>You know, this is not like a no disagreement culture.</p>
<p>Like we should, let&rsquo;s try to get the truth.</p>
<p>But don&rsquo;t bring stuff into work</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just gonna create division.</p>
<p>Make the workplace a refuge from division</p>
<p>about all these crazy things.</p>
<p>And like, we&rsquo;re all aligned here to work on the mission.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s do that.</p>
<p>Yeah, that was really, really, really refreshing to hear.</p>
<p>So this is me speaking, but there&rsquo;s a sense</p>
<p>when companies take on these issues publicly</p>
<p>from a CEO position or anywhere else,</p>
<p>that it does seem to optimize for virtue signaling</p>
<p>versus solving a particular problem.</p>
<p>Because to solve a particular problem,</p>
<p>you really have to really put in a huge,</p>
<p>you have to hire a huge number of,</p>
<p>you basically have to create a company with a company</p>
<p>to take on a particular thing.</p>
<p>But if you allow yourself to internally care</p>
<p>about a particular issue,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re basically pacifying some number of employee,</p>
<p>like making sure Slack doesn&rsquo;t get out of hand.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;re doing this kind of, from my perspective,</p>
<p>especially on issues that care about fake virtue signaling,</p>
<p>basically trying to understand</p>
<p>what will make me look the best,</p>
<p>what would make the company look the best</p>
<p>in this particular aspect.</p>
<p>And it just seems very shallow.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s optimizing for the wrong thing,</p>
<p>not for the solving of the problems,</p>
<p>but for the making yourself look like the good guy</p>
<p>and trying to then leverage that to say,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m the good guy in all situations.</p>
<p>And it just, it&rsquo;s the wrong thing.</p>
<p>And perhaps from your perspective as a CEO, as a leader,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s also creating division,</p>
<p>unnecessary division within people.</p>
<p>Like they get, yeah, there&rsquo;s something about us</p>
<p>who gets extremely argumentative about certain topics.</p>
<p>They really bring out the emotion.</p>
<p>And I think that probably, as you were saying,</p>
<p>that emotion is even probably okay,</p>
<p>maybe productive when that emotion has to do</p>
<p>with the mission of the company.</p>
<p>Like you really care about those disagreements</p>
<p>versus like something that has nothing to do</p>
<p>with increasing economic freedom using crypto.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>But it was so refreshing because it&rsquo;s rare.</p>
<p>Why do you think that&rsquo;s a rare?</p>
<p>So the city you&rsquo;re mentioning,</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s a bunch of cities,</p>
<p>but San Francisco is one such city when that culture.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s sad because San Francisco is also,</p>
<p>the Bay Area is also the hub historically</p>
<p>of some of the greatest innovation in human history.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s that tension.</p>
<p>How did that culture emerge there?</p>
<p>Where like the innovation was done by people</p>
<p>that are very mission driven.</p>
<p>You get a bunch of smart people together</p>
<p>to solve a difficult problem.</p>
<p>They get maybe sometimes too much blinders on,</p>
<p>but they try to balance that.</p>
<p>Because it requires that focus to solve an actual problem.</p>
<p>And yet that&rsquo;s also the place where this culture emerged.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a fascinating human dynamic.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Somebody will one day tell the history of Silicon Valley,</p>
<p>not just the innovation,</p>
<p>but the social dynamics that occurred there.</p>
<p>Anyway, why do you think that&rsquo;s so rare?</p>
<p>Well, because people don&rsquo;t wanna get attacked.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like super, you don&rsquo;t wanna get canceled, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s super uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Nobody wants to be called a racist</p>
<p>or whatever people wanna say on Twitter.</p>
<p>Did you get attacked?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, I definitely got attacked.</p>
<p>I mean, and I knew it would be controversial.</p>
<p>The only reason I did it, frankly,</p>
<p>was that I was kind of at my wit&rsquo;s end.</p>
<p>I was like, well, like I said earlier,</p>
<p>like the job, the CEO job sucks.</p>
<p>Like either I don&rsquo;t wanna do it or they have to go</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m gonna make the company into something that I want.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d spent eight or 90 years of my life at that point</p>
<p>kind of building this thing.</p>
<p>I was like, well, I could go start another company,</p>
<p>but it takes a long time to get momentum with these things.</p>
<p>And Coinbase is a very rare thing that happened in the world.</p>
<p>I feel very passionate about it.</p>
<p>So yeah, I&rsquo;m not gonna go.</p>
<p>Like I need to make this the company that I wanna work at.</p>
<p>And what was really interesting was that</p>
<p>there was such a huge outpouring of support.</p>
<p>So I knew that it would be controversial</p>
<p>and I would get attacked.</p>
<p>And predictably, there was some journalists</p>
<p>and New York Times and all these people</p>
<p>who kind of like went and started writing hit pieces</p>
<p>on the company shortly thereafter.</p>
<p>And they basically just call people who&rsquo;ve left the company</p>
<p>and can get quotes on whatever they want</p>
<p>and then they&rsquo;ll write a story.</p>
<p>So mainstream media, I lost a lot of trust</p>
<p>in mainstream media, frankly, after that.</p>
<p>And of course, it&rsquo;s kind of become obvious since then</p>
<p>that most mainstream media is like hyper politicized</p>
<p>at this point.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s basically either super left or super right.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not really that focused on truth.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s kind of unfortunate</p>
<p>because I think journalism is actually like really important</p>
<p>in society.</p>
<p>So that whole thing got eroded in the US.</p>
<p>Luckily, there&rsquo;s sort of new media, people like you</p>
<p>and a whole bunch of people.</p>
<p>Did that blog post help that statement,</p>
<p>the 95 people that remained,</p>
<p>is this still something you struggle with?</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s also a culture of the broader tech space.</p>
<p>Okay, so that was an interesting thing, which was that,</p>
<p>so the 95% of people stayed.</p>
<p>I got a huge outpouring of support from people who said,</p>
<p>thank God you finally spoke up and said something</p>
<p>because frankly, it was making it not a very fun place</p>
<p>to work either.</p>
<p>And I realized that there is, I think there was,</p>
<p>I think Nassim Taleb has this blog post</p>
<p>about the tyranny of the 1% or something like that.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s basically a relatively small group,</p>
<p>one in 5% or something like that,</p>
<p>that is really upset about something.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the majority of the company, it&rsquo;s like 5%.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s another 15% or something that are sympathetic</p>
<p>to the cause.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re actually somewhat suggestible.</p>
<p>They will go along with whatever,</p>
<p>because it sounds reasonable.</p>
<p>These are like real issues they&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not to say that it&rsquo;s not real.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ll kind of get swept up in it.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s an 80% of the company that basically</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t agree or just wants to get their work done</p>
<p>without all this drama or distraction.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re afraid to speak up because if they speak up,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re afraid of being, again, called a racist,</p>
<p>like fired, ostracized amongst their peers.</p>
<p>And so it did require it to get to a bad enough place</p>
<p>for me to finally say, you know what?</p>
<p>I just, I feel like I have to do this.</p>
<p>Live through the short term attacks of the press,</p>
<p>which ultimately was very freeing for me</p>
<p>because now I don&rsquo;t really care.</p>
<p>And now I can actually just build the company</p>
<p>that I want to build without caring about that.</p>
<p>And then what was cool was a lot of really great people</p>
<p>reached out to the Coinbase too after that.</p>
<p>And were like, I&rsquo;m an early engineer at Google or wherever.</p>
<p>And this culture has gotten kind of messed up</p>
<p>and I want to work at a company</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s willing to stand for that.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;ve gotten a lot of good people come over.</p>
<p>Basically what I realized, and by the way,</p>
<p>our diversity numbers and all that stuff,</p>
<p>people told me when I was drafting this poster,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t post this, people, underrepresented groups</p>
<p>will never want to work at this company again.</p>
<p>And I was like, I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>I talked to our ERG groups and they&rsquo;re not telling me</p>
<p>they care about this stuff that much.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re telling me they just want to be respected at work</p>
<p>and do good work and contribute.</p>
<p>So my gut was telling me that that advice was wrong.</p>
<p>And I can tell you a year after doing it,</p>
<p>our diversity numbers are basically either the same</p>
<p>or better in every category.</p>
<p>So that turned out to be false.</p>
<p>Look, I hate to be polarizing on either dimension here.</p>
<p>I just want to get good work done</p>
<p>and build good stuff with technology.</p>
<p>So I think companies should just have reasonable policies.</p>
<p>You want to get rid of bias in hiring.</p>
<p>You want to attract great people from all</p>
<p>different backgrounds.</p>
<p>We have pledge 1%.</p>
<p>We put 1% of the company equity into a foundation.</p>
<p>I hope we&rsquo;re able to do good stuff with that.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s give back in some way.</p>
<p>But the main message I guess for me is the core mission,</p>
<p>the core work that we&rsquo;re doing on economic freedom</p>
<p>and just all of our products,</p>
<p>that is the main value that we&rsquo;re contributing in the world.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just do that more.</p>
<p>And hopefully we can get from 89 million verified users</p>
<p>to a billion or whatever.</p>
<p>And then I just think that&rsquo;s how we&rsquo;ll have</p>
<p>the biggest impact.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s tempting though.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so interesting how companies get tempted to help.</p>
<p>And you step in and it&rsquo;s almost like a drug</p>
<p>and then you can&rsquo;t, you forget.</p>
<p>I mean, like all of us in life just have to be companies.</p>
<p>You get distracted and maintaining focus.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re absolutely right.</p>
<p>The way for Coinbase to add value to the world</p>
<p>is to maximize the mission that it&rsquo;s on,</p>
<p>not other stuff.</p>
<p>And when you get wealthier and more successful,</p>
<p>it becomes more and more tempting</p>
<p>to just help out in some other shallow ways.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>And you just kind of brought that to light.</p>
<p>So it was very refreshing.</p>
<p>And it shouldn&rsquo;t be controversial</p>
<p>to sort of focus on just getting stuff done.</p>
<p>Well, let me ask you,</p>
<p>I mean, do you think that this,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all these things tie together.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s like a general trend of like more censorship.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s like more cancel culture.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some of these like freedom values</p>
<p>are kind of, even like freezing people&rsquo;s accounts,</p>
<p>like the trucker thing that happened.</p>
<p>And this seems like there&rsquo;s a general trend</p>
<p>of more authoritarian policies there.</p>
<p>But do you feel like the tide is turning on that?</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s counter examples to it we&rsquo;ve seen recently.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s the last gasp of old way of doing things.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s desperation and so on.</p>
<p>Because to be fair, it&rsquo;s kind of the internet,</p>
<p>which is where&rsquo;s the source of a lot of this,</p>
<p>where people have a voice,</p>
<p>is making the power centers of the world really nervous.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s where that&rsquo;s coming from, I think.</p>
<p>And the internet is tricky.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s weird.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s full of bots.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s full of like misinformation of all kinds,</p>
<p>full of large groups with conspiracy theories and so on.</p>
<p>And I mean misinformation broadly.</p>
<p>People are misusing the word misinformation.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just, governments are just labeling</p>
<p>random things with misinformation just to censor them.</p>
<p>But I just think it&rsquo;s just like a new world</p>
<p>where the internet is really finally taking hold,</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s billions of devices</p>
<p>and everybody has a voice.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost, basically governments and powerful people</p>
<p>are slightly losing hold of power.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re starting to freak out a little bit.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>And once you have young people that are coming up now,</p>
<p>gain power, I think we&rsquo;ll rebalance everything.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s, like you said,</p>
<p>promising signs that it&rsquo;s obvious</p>
<p>that the majority of people want freedom.</p>
<p>And that means a lot of things.</p>
<p>That means economic freedom.</p>
<p>That means freedom to have a voice,</p>
<p>freedom to move around,</p>
<p>freedom to act in the way they,</p>
<p>without reasonable sort of limitations</p>
<p>by people that don&rsquo;t have their best interests.</p>
<p>And I gain more hope from just regular people</p>
<p>that are fighting and like demanding</p>
<p>being able to have freedom of speech,</p>
<p>or more specifically sort of resisting</p>
<p>crude overreach of government in the acts of censorship,</p>
<p>at least in the United States.</p>
<p>And hopefully that percolates out to the rest of the world</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s struggling on a much more basic level</p>
<p>where people are being put in prison for the words they say,</p>
<p>not just banned from Twitter.</p>
<p>Right, it could be worse.</p>
<p>What are some lessons from your failures and your successes</p>
<p>about what it takes to run a company?</p>
<p>I think one of the things that I learned about leadership</p>
<p>is that I never really thought of myself</p>
<p>as a very natural leader, to be honest.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I was a natural leader.</p>
<p>But so I always envisioned good leaders</p>
<p>as like these military generals,</p>
<p>like they seem so confident and they&rsquo;re just like bark orders,</p>
<p>charge that hill and do this.</p>
<p>And I was actually like more introverted</p>
<p>and kind of, I wasn&rsquo;t really confident</p>
<p>in the way I communicated.</p>
<p>And so what I realized is that</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s lots of different kinds of leaders.</p>
<p>You can be any kind of CEO you want, right?</p>
<p>I was kind of more of like a product, technical focus CEO.</p>
<p>And I preferred to sort of hear everyone&rsquo;s opinion.</p>
<p>And it wasn&rsquo;t just gonna like render a decision in the room</p>
<p>in some like kind of heated moment</p>
<p>and like piss off half the people.</p>
<p>I would do like, all right, I&rsquo;m gonna go think about it</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll send you my decision later today</p>
<p>or tomorrow or whatever.</p>
<p>And so I found ways to kind of make it work for me</p>
<p>where I could basically, I always tried to avoid like,</p>
<p>when people getting like super emotional about something</p>
<p>and like, I think they&rsquo;re thinking,</p>
<p>their judgment goes down, right?</p>
<p>And just like never make a decision when you&rsquo;re angry, right?</p>
<p>And so I would always sort of try to get a sense of,</p>
<p>are these people like trying to be right</p>
<p>or are they trying to seek the truth?</p>
<p>And you can do these little tricks like,</p>
<p>okay, you argue that person&rsquo;s position</p>
<p>and you argue the other one</p>
<p>and like see if you can genuinely represent it.</p>
<p>Now I know you&rsquo;re listening and these kinds of things.</p>
<p>But I guess, sorry,</p>
<p>getting back to your question about leadership,</p>
<p>I think I basically just kept doing things</p>
<p>that were a little outside my comfort zone.</p>
<p>And then my comfort zone kept getting bigger and bigger.</p>
<p>You know?</p>
<p>And so I think that&rsquo;s how you build confidence</p>
<p>is you do the thing that&rsquo;s scary</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like a little outside.</p>
<p>And like when I first started Coinbase,</p>
<p>I had never managed anybody.</p>
<p>I would have been scared to death</p>
<p>to have put out like a very controversial opinion like that</p>
<p>and sort of, all right, 5% of people will go,</p>
<p>we didn&rsquo;t know what percent it was gonna be by the way.</p>
<p>It could have been 1%, it could have been 50%.</p>
<p>Like, but we went into it scary</p>
<p>because it was a scary thing.</p>
<p>I was like, I don&rsquo;t know, I think this is right.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just gonna do it.</p>
<p>So if you do enough scary things,</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;ll build the confidence.</p>
<p>And I feel like I&rsquo;m still on that journey.</p>
<p>Every year or two at Coinbase,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some big thing that comes out as like,</p>
<p>oh my God, like I didn&rsquo;t sleep well for a week</p>
<p>and like, this is the next level, right?</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s how you learn and grow.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re still going up that mountain</p>
<p>through the fog one step at a time.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Can I just quickly ask you about a couple of other efforts</p>
<p>that are super interesting that you&rsquo;re involved with?</p>
<p>So first of all, a little bit more old school,</p>
<p>fascinating effort of research hub.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s that about the GitHub for open science?</p>
<p>Yeah, okay, so basically I&rsquo;ve had a chance</p>
<p>to try to help a couple other companies</p>
<p>get off the ground too,</p>
<p>cause I wanna see various efforts out there succeed.</p>
<p>And one of them I&rsquo;ve always thought about</p>
<p>like why is scientific research</p>
<p>not more like open source software</p>
<p>or why couldn&rsquo;t it be much faster, right?</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s, you&rsquo;ve probably have seen this</p>
<p>like in an academic setting, right?</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s all kinds of things that feel very antiquated</p>
<p>to me about scientific research,</p>
<p>everything from the funding process and grants</p>
<p>to how peer review works, to how you submit to journals,</p>
<p>all the costs associated with journals,</p>
<p>you know, that the people,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d think like you&rsquo;d get paid for this or something</p>
<p>and it would then be available to all the taxpayers for free</p>
<p>but no, they&rsquo;re like, they&rsquo;re all pay walled</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s like these big companies</p>
<p>that have sort of, in my view,</p>
<p>kind of held back innovation here.</p>
<p>So, and the preprint servers like bioarchive</p>
<p>and archive.org have really helped this</p>
<p>but those websites are,</p>
<p>they look like they&rsquo;re kind of from like 15 years ago</p>
<p>or something.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s like Craigslist or something.</p>
<p>Yeah, so anyway, one of the things I,</p>
<p>once Coinbase went public last year,</p>
<p>I had a little bit of liquidity and I was like,</p>
<p>all right, let me fund a small team</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s see if we can,</p>
<p>if they can like go off and make something better here.</p>
<p>So we have a prototype out there,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s at researchhub.com, people can check it out.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s basically, you know,</p>
<p>the first version is kind of like Reddit for science.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s like various hubs, which are like journals,</p>
<p>but you know, you can publish papers there,</p>
<p>you can use an electronic lab notebook</p>
<p>to sort of have a modern day paper,</p>
<p>which is not just a PDF that&rsquo;s static,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a living document.</p>
<p>Ideally in the future, you know,</p>
<p>you can get comments and feedback from people in there,</p>
<p>you can update it over time.</p>
<p>We want people to be able to share the code</p>
<p>and the data sets associated with their paper,</p>
<p>research paper is not just a PDF.</p>
<p>And in the future, we want to make it even where like,</p>
<p>you know, people can get funding for science</p>
<p>through that site and even license out innovations</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;ve made.</p>
<p>Because the other thing I&rsquo;ve noticed in life</p>
<p>is that there&rsquo;s kind of like,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a bunch of people working on science</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a bunch of people building companies</p>
<p>and they very rarely intersect,</p>
<p>but when they do, you get the best things</p>
<p>like SpaceX and Genentech and even Google</p>
<p>and like even Coinbase was based on a research paper,</p>
<p>the Bitcoin white paper.</p>
<p>And so most business people are like creating companies</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t have any scientific innovation,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re just like marketing based on, you know, whatever.</p>
<p>And then a lot of scientists are making things</p>
<p>which never actually benefit humanity</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re not commercialized and turned into products.</p>
<p>And so if we can somehow create a translation layer</p>
<p>between those two groups and help them,</p>
<p>you know, helps align the market forces,</p>
<p>align scientific research to market forces</p>
<p>so that they&rsquo;re more incentivized.</p>
<p>Like if you discover CRISPR or something like that,</p>
<p>like you should be a billionaire, you know,</p>
<p>and like all the downstream implications of that,</p>
<p>not going through some antiquated tech transfer office</p>
<p>or whatever.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re an entrepreneur,</p>
<p>you should be looking to commercialize</p>
<p>the latest scientific innovations.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s kind of like the longterm vision</p>
<p>for that site.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s just an early step today,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;ve got like a really passionate community on there</p>
<p>that are jumping into like, you know,</p>
<p>computer science or longevity or various bio hubs</p>
<p>or whatever and like beginning to source</p>
<p>the best innovations, but also discuss them, improve them</p>
<p>and publish through the site.</p>
<p>So I have a question about incentives,</p>
<p>but first let me say for people listening</p>
<p>who are outside of academia might not be familiar</p>
<p>with an absurd situation.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s journals, like you mentioned,</p>
<p>and scientists publishing those journals</p>
<p>and the journals provide very little value</p>
<p>except matching you with reviewers that are unpaid.</p>
<p>And so in the digital world,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re providing basically almost no value</p>
<p>except hosting your paper.</p>
<p>And they put up a paywall and charge people to access that.</p>
<p>And that charge is not like even Netflix fees,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re talking about a lot of money.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re basically blocking your research</p>
<p>that should be wide open from the world</p>
<p>and creating a paywall.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a fascinating like scam that&rsquo;s actually holding back.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s a shitty scam</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re not making that much money.</p>
<p>I feel like a definition of a scam,</p>
<p>you should at least be making money.</p>
<p>So like significant amount of money,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re basically making shady money</p>
<p>and holding back all of human knowledge, okay.</p>
<p>So that put aside and people get a little confused</p>
<p>because the journals aren&rsquo;t the ones paying the scientists.</p>
<p>People think like the journals are somehow</p>
<p>funding the scientists, therefore they have the right</p>
<p>to put up a paywall.</p>
<p>No, no, no, the funding is coming from elsewhere.</p>
<p>Journals are the middleman that nobody asks for,</p>
<p>especially in the digital world.</p>
<p>Anyway, that said, there is a interesting kind of incentives</p>
<p>for scientists, which is prestige and so on.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a thing with journals,</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s a prestigious journal</p>
<p>and you pass the review process, you get into that journal</p>
<p>or a prestigious conference in computer science,</p>
<p>then that&rsquo;s seen as a good thing in your resume.</p>
<p>And, oh, not just your resume, within your community,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a respected thing.</p>
<p>Is there some way to achieve that same kind of incentive</p>
<p>in the open setting of research hub?</p>
<p>So like where I could say, I got X, Y and Z,</p>
<p>like, look, I&rsquo;m impressive</p>
<p>because this happened on research hub.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>Like the whole academia, like progress track</p>
<p>is about like where you got published</p>
<p>and how many citations.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s kind of like a false economy of reputation</p>
<p>because like, there&rsquo;s not real money backing it.</p>
<p>And so I think we&rsquo;ve thought about this a little bit.</p>
<p>And I think the research hub team has an opportunity</p>
<p>to do something here that basically says like,</p>
<p>okay, I had the top paper for 2022</p>
<p>in biology on in here.</p>
<p>And you basically publish a list,</p>
<p>a leaderboards of these like top for the month,</p>
<p>the year in all these different categories.</p>
<p>Then actually, we should probably give out grants</p>
<p>and awards in addition to that,</p>
<p>fund those people almost like fellows</p>
<p>or even give out like, you know how like the Nobel prize,</p>
<p>there should be like a research hub prize or something</p>
<p>and like ship people,</p>
<p>maybe even ship like a print version of a journal</p>
<p>that is the top papers in each category</p>
<p>in each month or whatever.</p>
<p>And then like people want to put that in their wall</p>
<p>and in the lab.</p>
<p>And like, so I do think we need to sort of change,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, like the traditional folks in academia</p>
<p>or science would probably think this is like crazy idea.</p>
<p>But I think we need to change the culture</p>
<p>to not celebrate getting published in paywall journals,</p>
<p>almost like friends don&rsquo;t let friends publish</p>
<p>in like paywall journals.</p>
<p>Like, cause that&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s just not helping humanity.</p>
<p>So like, you know, it should be more prestigious</p>
<p>to publish in an open science way and get the top spot.</p>
<p>That should be celebrated above being published</p>
<p>in whatever, I don&rsquo;t even want to name one of them,</p>
<p>you know?</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s currently,</p>
<p>the culture has already shifted</p>
<p>to where almost everybody publishes on archive</p>
<p>and by archive and so on.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But, so that the culture is there on that scene,</p>
<p>friends don&rsquo;t let friends not publish open,</p>
<p>but then the prestige thing is missing,</p>
<p>which is like anyone can publish an archive.</p>
<p>So how do you know it&rsquo;s actually a strong paper?</p>
<p>Now, funny enough, even with the crappy systems we have now,</p>
<p>word of mouth is powerful.</p>
<p>Like you have a, like citation system is pretty powerful.</p>
<p>So like you say, okay, this is a strong paper.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t need reviewers, our human eyes are the reviewers,</p>
<p>like the community is the reviewers.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s already, like that part is there,</p>
<p>but it would be nice to have like, you know,</p>
<p>nature level, like this is respect,</p>
<p>this is a respectful accomplishment.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And something like a leaderboard,</p>
<p>but a stable kind of system.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And I should mention too,</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s a crypto angle to this too,</p>
<p>which is, so research hub has a coin associated</p>
<p>with research coin.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s basically, if people, you know,</p>
<p>upvote your paper or like support it,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll accumulate more research coin,</p>
<p>which is basically like rep or like a reward token.</p>
<p>And so that is a way to, I guess,</p>
<p>measure the community&rsquo;s collective view of that paper,</p>
<p>a form of peer review.</p>
<p>And it can even be weighted by like the reputation</p>
<p>of the people voting on it and that sort of thing over time.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think the last thing I&rsquo;ll just say is that,</p>
<p>so I think from a rep, like a prestige point of view,</p>
<p>it won&rsquo;t start off that way.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll probably start off like being a little more quirky,</p>
<p>like, you know, like remember when YouTube first started,</p>
<p>it was like people posting weird cat videos and stuff.</p>
<p>And, but now like, you know,</p>
<p>if you have a million subscribers on YouTube,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s probably better than getting like a TV show on NBC</p>
<p>or whoever the traditional gatekeeper was.</p>
<p>So my hope, it might take 10 years, 20 years, whatever,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m hoping that this can sort of be the new</p>
<p>prestigious way that young people publish in science</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;ll come to be viewed as more prestigious.</p>
<p>The journals, the traditional journals</p>
<p>will be viewed as old fashioned.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s definitely a system that could do a lot better.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a lot of incredible, brilliant people</p>
<p>doing science, they deserve better, the better platforms.</p>
<p>So another thing you&rsquo;re taking on and helping out with</p>
<p>is this new limit, which is looking at longevity.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the idea there?</p>
<p>Yeah, okay, so as you can see, I&rsquo;m excited about science.</p>
<p>Like I think, you know, science is sort of the,</p>
<p>basically if you get scientific innovation,</p>
<p>then you get better products and you get better</p>
<p>economic growth and then you get all kinds of like surplus</p>
<p>in society that can go to arts and philosophy</p>
<p>and like all kinds of stuff.</p>
<p>But with new limits, so yeah, I kind of got,</p>
<p>I started hosting some dinners with scientists last year</p>
<p>and I was learning about all kinds of the latest stuff</p>
<p>happening in bio and there&rsquo;s a lot of really cool stuff</p>
<p>happening with like CAR T cells and CRISPR</p>
<p>and all these things.</p>
<p>And anyway, one of the topics I started to learn more about</p>
<p>was something called cell reprogramming.</p>
<p>And, you know, people maybe have heard of this</p>
<p>induced pluripotent stem cells where you could take</p>
<p>like a skin cell and turn it back into a stem cell.</p>
<p>And Shinya Yamanaka won the Nobel prize for this work</p>
<p>that was done in 2006.</p>
<p>And, you know, it&rsquo;s kind of a crazy thing.</p>
<p>You can turn one cell into another type of cell.</p>
<p>Well, people recently have been experimenting</p>
<p>with different types of transcription factors</p>
<p>that would either not,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t want the cell to go all the way back</p>
<p>to being a stem cell.</p>
<p>You can end up getting like cancerous cells</p>
<p>and things like that.</p>
<p>But you want it basically the cell to revert</p>
<p>a little bit earlier in its, you know,</p>
<p>it would call it the Waddington landscape,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s basically like go, become act,</p>
<p>start to act like a bit of a younger cell,</p>
<p>but not to de differentiate and become more like a stem cell.</p>
<p>And so I decided this might be an interesting area</p>
<p>to go fund.</p>
<p>I think that that team has come together.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s like some really talented people</p>
<p>who&rsquo;ve come together to help get that off the ground.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re basically building a platform</p>
<p>that can test a lot of different transcription factors</p>
<p>on different cell types and hopefully find ways</p>
<p>to rejuvenate different types of cells and tissues</p>
<p>to extend human health span.</p>
<p>I mean, the moonshot goal here, you know,</p>
<p>the get to Mars is that there could be some therapy here</p>
<p>that in, I don&rsquo;t know, 10 or 20 years that you take</p>
<p>and from a whole body point of view</p>
<p>is sort of rejuvenating tissue,</p>
<p>not just one type of tissue like your immune system,</p>
<p>but eventually your whole body, maybe even your brain</p>
<p>so that, you know, we don&rsquo;t have that issue</p>
<p>where people who are older have trouble learning</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;re more ossified in their thinking.</p>
<p>To me, this is just, I always think about, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s actually a little inspired by Elon, right?</p>
<p>Is like, what are some of the biggest things in the world</p>
<p>like that are probably high technology risk,</p>
<p>but if they did work,</p>
<p>maybe they&rsquo;re kind of low chance of working,</p>
<p>but if they did work would have enormous impact.</p>
<p>I like the idea of trying hard tech problems,</p>
<p>especially for people like founders like me</p>
<p>who&rsquo;ve made some money in software,</p>
<p>which I think we&rsquo;re in kind of like a golden age of software</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s like fortunes to be made,</p>
<p>but if you do make some money in that,</p>
<p>my hope is people will like do atoms, not bits, you know,</p>
<p>and try some of the harder things like in biotech</p>
<p>or, you know, I guess he&rsquo;s doing cars and rockets and stuff,</p>
<p>but anyway, I think we should try hard tech</p>
<p>or, you know, physical science problems as well</p>
<p>and see if that can advance for team human.</p>
<p>Yeah, so he&rsquo;s also doing bio with Neuralink</p>
<p>and I feel like bio is tough because it&rsquo;s messy.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t understand it as well.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t understand it.</p>
<p>The risk is higher in terms of, not the risk is higher,</p>
<p>but like you have to deal with the actual sort of,</p>
<p>to get to human, to get to stuff</p>
<p>where it could be therapies for actual human bodies</p>
<p>is tricky because you have to prove that it&rsquo;s safe,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s effective, all those kinds of things with FDA.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s tricky.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very difficult.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a long journey.</p>
<p>I mean.</p>
<p>If I can give a quick plug.</p>
<p>So yeah, I&rsquo;m on the board at New Limit.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re hiring talented scientists</p>
<p>that are interested in the cellular programming space.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t necessarily have to be coming</p>
<p>from like an aging background or anything like that.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s sort of a small group of people doing even.</p>
<p>So this is a new thing?</p>
<p>This is a, is New Limit relatively new?</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s very new.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a small team today, just a handful of people.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;re hiring more there.</p>
<p>If people are excited about that space, reach out.</p>
<p>And same thing for Research Hub.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a small team there that&rsquo;s really awesome.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s doing more like software engineering,</p>
<p>design, product, that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>What advice would you give?</p>
<p>If you put on your old, wise, sage hat,</p>
<p>what advice would you give to young people today?</p>
<p>High school, maybe undergrad and college about life.</p>
<p>So like career, having a career they can be proud of,</p>
<p>or maybe a life they can be proud of.</p>
<p>So people can do whatever they want to be happy, right?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s not one way to do it.</p>
<p>I do think that some people,</p>
<p>a particular type of people out there,</p>
<p>a lot of people actually,</p>
<p>they want to have an impact on the world.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how they get a sense of fulfillment, right?</p>
<p>So I mean, you need to have like health, physical health.</p>
<p>You need to have good relationships,</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s lots of things.</p>
<p>But most people want to do something important.</p>
<p>They want to have fulfilling work,</p>
<p>a way that they can feel like they&rsquo;re contributing.</p>
<p>I think a lot of people, young people today are thinking</p>
<p>like I should be an activist or something like that.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s people in the world who have power</p>
<p>and a lot of people who don&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t have power.</p>
<p>And so the way to change the world is to speak truth</p>
<p>to power or like criticize power</p>
<p>and try to pressure them to change.</p>
<p>To me, I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s the right way</p>
<p>to actually have an impact on the world</p>
<p>because everybody has probably,</p>
<p>I think people have more power than they realize.</p>
<p>And by the way, it&rsquo;s easy to be a critic.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to actually change these things and fix it.</p>
<p>And so you&rsquo;ll get a lot of accolades</p>
<p>from friends and things like that</p>
<p>if you kind of go around criticizing, it&rsquo;s easy to do.</p>
<p>Like everything is broken and could be better,</p>
<p>including stuff I&rsquo;m working on.</p>
<p>I find like so frustrating.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a million things I want to be better about</p>
<p>like what we&rsquo;re doing in Coinbase.</p>
<p>So be the person in the arena,</p>
<p>like that Theodore Roosevelt quote,</p>
<p>I think he said it right.</p>
<p>Like go chew glass and stare into the abyss.</p>
<p>Like if you really want to have an impact,</p>
<p>either join a company that has a mission</p>
<p>that is trying to fix the thing you&rsquo;re passionate about</p>
<p>or start that company if it doesn&rsquo;t exist</p>
<p>or start a charity if it&rsquo;s not suitable</p>
<p>to be a company or whatever it is,</p>
<p>but go try to be a part of the solution.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t just criticize or be a part of the problem.</p>
<p>My hope is that more people can realize</p>
<p>that they actually can have a meaningful impact that way.</p>
<p>And I think that to me,</p>
<p>technology is actually one of the most important ways</p>
<p>to improve the world.</p>
<p>Like if you look at climate change,</p>
<p>like a lot of the best ideas like carbon sequestration,</p>
<p>all these things, it&rsquo;s a technology thing, right?</p>
<p>If you want to try to fix education,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like look at like Khan Academy</p>
<p>and all this stuff going online, right?</p>
<p>If you want to fix, you know, whatever transportation</p>
<p>and like the financial system and global freedom</p>
<p>and like equality of all these things,</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s typically the way to get something changed</p>
<p>in the world today is with technology.</p>
<p>And so I do think people, it&rsquo;s very bizarre to me</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s this kind of like anti tech thing going on.</p>
<p>Look, nothing is perfect.</p>
<p>Like if you create something new</p>
<p>and like tens of millions of people use it</p>
<p>or billions of people use it,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like there&rsquo;s going to be some bad people</p>
<p>who use it too, okay?</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s, you know, society is complicated,</p>
<p>but like I think most of these things have been net positive</p>
<p>because most people in the world are good</p>
<p>is at least my view.</p>
<p>So yes, we can mitigate like the 1% of bad people</p>
<p>trying to abuse something,</p>
<p>but 99% of people in the world are good.</p>
<p>And the way you can improve the world is with technology,</p>
<p>joining companies, starting companies</p>
<p>that are working on the right stuff.</p>
<p>So I hope more young people do that.</p>
<p>And just, if you&rsquo;re not sure what to do,</p>
<p>like just get started with anything.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how you learn.</p>
<p>And basically have the optimism</p>
<p>that you have the power to do the change.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s easy to distract yourself by being the critic.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s almost like acknowledging to yourself</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s all you can be,</p>
<p>but basically everybody has the power to be the fixer.</p>
<p>I like, chew glass and look into the abyss.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s much more fun than it sounds.</p>
<p>What do you think is the meaning of this whole thing?</p>
<p>Why are we here?</p>
<p>Life.</p>
<p>Yep, what&rsquo;s the meaning of life?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s this existence we got?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re trying to increase the amount of economic freedom</p>
<p>on this planet or trying to alleviate</p>
<p>some of the suffering.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But why?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really think there is any point to life.</p>
<p>You know, somebody once told me,</p>
<p>you know, if you go into these like,</p>
<p>kind of really big existential questions,</p>
<p>it can get a little scary</p>
<p>because like you stare off the cliff</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s like, there&rsquo;s nothing there.</p>
<p>You know, this one person told me one time they were like,</p>
<p>you know, Brian, you should probably snorkel, don&rsquo;t scuba.</p>
<p>I guess, and I think they were trying to say like,</p>
<p>I, some of my friends have done this, right?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll go to like, you know, epic meditation retreats</p>
<p>and like, they&rsquo;ll kind of come back</p>
<p>with all this existential dread of like,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the meaning of it all.</p>
<p>And then like, as far as I can tell,</p>
<p>we are just some organic molecules in the ocean</p>
<p>started like dividing and replicating</p>
<p>and the selfish gene and all this stuff,</p>
<p>like basically ended up here.</p>
<p>And our only, it&rsquo;s some kind of like really naive algorithm</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just kind of trying to get us</p>
<p>to survive and replicate.</p>
<p>And we have DNA just like every other animal.</p>
<p>And so we happened to develop</p>
<p>these like really cool neocortexes.</p>
<p>And so now we&rsquo;re sort of self aware</p>
<p>and we have all these big questions</p>
<p>and maybe we&rsquo;ll create another, you know,</p>
<p>as computers get better,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll create the simulation inside our thing.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s cool.</p>
<p>Like we should basically,</p>
<p>I just want to keep watching the movie, you know, unfold.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s part of why I want to work on,</p>
<p>like New Limit is really cool.</p>
<p>Cause it&rsquo;s helped, if people can live longer,</p>
<p>whether that&rsquo;s uploading their brain to the cloud</p>
<p>or, you know, basically through we get biology to work</p>
<p>or the strong AI to work or whatever.</p>
<p>One of those two hopefully works out.</p>
<p>And then we get to keep watching the movie</p>
<p>and see how it all unfolds.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s fun.</p>
<p>And so I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s like an answer,</p>
<p>but I guess I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s any real purpose.</p>
<p>So just try to have fun.</p>
<p>Well, the cool thing is that we get to write the movie</p>
<p>as we watch it.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s exactly right.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s like the Steve Jobs quote and all that,</p>
<p>where he&rsquo;s like, everything around you was invented</p>
<p>by somebody who just was like,</p>
<p>this was a crazy idea they thought up.</p>
<p>So once you realize you can kind of do anything you want,</p>
<p>then that&rsquo;s what you start to go,</p>
<p>you start to go try crazier stuff.</p>
<p>I mean, this is another one of those areas where,</p>
<p>not to get too out there,</p>
<p>but like, you know, when you&rsquo;re,</p>
<p>I think you can build your comfort zone</p>
<p>around like people being upset with you.</p>
<p>You can also build your range</p>
<p>of what you think is possible, right?</p>
<p>Like when I was in my 20s,</p>
<p>I was like reading all these books</p>
<p>about like self improvement and goal,</p>
<p>how to write down your goals and stuff.</p>
<p>And my goals were like,</p>
<p>someday I wanna make $100,000 a year or something like,</p>
<p>and that was, and you know,</p>
<p>and it seemed like a little outlandish or what,</p>
<p>I wrote down these goals,</p>
<p>like I wanna own rental property or something anyway.</p>
<p>And then I slowly started to get some of these things done</p>
<p>over a couple of years.</p>
<p>And so I started to think a little bigger.</p>
<p>I remember one time I wrote down this goal where I was like,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the craziest thing I could think of?</p>
<p>And I was like, what if I, I wanna write,</p>
<p>I wanna start a billion dollar tech company.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s crazy.</p>
<p>And I had never started like a million dollar tech company</p>
<p>or any tech company really.</p>
<p>So what business did I have writing that goal down?</p>
<p>I remember I wrote that on a piece of paper like,</p>
<p>like probably every day for a year or something almost,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it was every day,</p>
<p>but like I wrote it down a lot.</p>
<p>And so little things started to happen.</p>
<p>I was like, all right,</p>
<p>well, maybe I should move back to the Bay area</p>
<p>from Buenos Aires.</p>
<p>Maybe I should try to apply to Y Combinator or whatever.</p>
<p>Like, and I started thinking about these ideas.</p>
<p>And so whatever it gets you fired up,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t have to be like some company goal</p>
<p>or startup thing.</p>
<p>It could be anything, right?</p>
<p>Maybe you wanna publish a book</p>
<p>or like do something creatively or whatever.</p>
<p>Anyway, I think like within seven years, no,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s probably more like 10 years</p>
<p>of me writing that goal down.</p>
<p>Coinbase had a valuation over a billion dollars.</p>
<p>So it was out of my realm of what was even possible.</p>
<p>And then within 10 years,</p>
<p>you can accomplish more in 10 years than you think,</p>
<p>less in a year than you think.</p>
<p>So now I&rsquo;m like, okay, what&rsquo;s the next goal?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the, okay, maybe I wanna get a billion people</p>
<p>accessing the open financial system</p>
<p>through our products every day.</p>
<p>That would be cool for humanity.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a pretty crazy goal.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s only 8 billion people or something, right?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s one out of eight.</p>
<p>Or maybe I can radically,</p>
<p>like if I make some like the right investments or whatever,</p>
<p>I can like help radically extend human health span</p>
<p>or whatever, right?</p>
<p>So try crazier stuff.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, even if it doesn&rsquo;t work,</p>
<p>like hopefully you&rsquo;ll advance the state of affairs,</p>
<p>like something interesting will happen.</p>
<p>And so most people today,</p>
<p>they look at people trying this stuff and they&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>oh my God, they&rsquo;re so, they&rsquo;re a genius or whatever.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, or they&rsquo;re an idiot.</p>
<p>Like one of the two, neither one are true.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like anybody can start</p>
<p>by thinking about what they want and then like go for it.</p>
<p>And then once you get that,</p>
<p>like go for something a little bigger</p>
<p>and like you just have fun with it.</p>
<p>And the universe is a way of smiling and helping you out</p>
<p>if you just write it down and you dream big.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something about just karma,</p>
<p>about the energy you put into this world.</p>
<p>Other people will help you out, doors will open.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll notice that the doors opened</p>
<p>and you actually have a shot at making it happen.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a funny world.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, I don&rsquo;t really subscribe</p>
<p>to all like the woo woo interpretations of this,</p>
<p>but my very rational brain interpretation of it</p>
<p>is that if you just wake up every day</p>
<p>and write down like what you want to get done</p>
<p>and towards your longer goals, your larger goals,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just on your mind that day.</p>
<p>So you start to notice opportunities</p>
<p>and you think about it more.</p>
<p>So Brian, thank you for dreaming big.</p>
<p>Thank you for doing what you&rsquo;re doing,</p>
<p>doing incredible engineering at scale,</p>
<p>trying to help people from all over the world</p>
<p>and actually helping me personally get more into crypto</p>
<p>just cause it&rsquo;s so easy.</p>
<p>So thank you so much.</p>
<p>And thank you so much</p>
<p>for giving your extremely valuable time today</p>
<p>to this awesome conversation.</p>
<p>Thanks for your awesome podcast.</p>
<p>I love it and I listen to it often.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation</p>
<p>with Brian Armstrong.</p>
<p>To support this podcast,</p>
<p>please check out our sponsors in the description.</p>
<p>And now let me leave you with some words</p>
