    <p>It&rsquo;s Hardcore History, Addendum.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re finally getting enough of these Hardcore History Addendum shows out</p>
<p>so that a little bit of the pattern, I think,</p>
<p>is starting to establish itself in terms of what it was going to be,</p>
<p>because we said at the outset I was hoping to use it</p>
<p>as a subsidiary feed for things that just didn&rsquo;t really fit</p>
<p>into the big Hardcore History experience, should we say.</p>
<p>So far we&rsquo;ve had interviews.</p>
<p>Daniele Bellulli and I did a program together.</p>
<p>We did a sort of a mini Hardcore History episode</p>
<p>on the sinking of the Indianapolis and all those sharks.</p>
<p>And now I think we will put the last piece maybe in place</p>
<p>in terms of the strange stuff you might find</p>
<p>on the Hardcore History Addendum feed,</p>
<p>with an admittedly somewhat perhaps historically goofy show,</p>
<p>but that doesn&rsquo;t mean it doesn&rsquo;t have interesting elements</p>
<p>in it that might be worth examining</p>
<p>that point to bigger societal historical trends.</p>
<p>But it falls into the category of these little teeny</p>
<p>narrowly focused sort of subjects</p>
<p>that once again I figure we&rsquo;ll use in the Addendum program.</p>
<p>I mean, it might be boxing, it might be punk rock,</p>
<p>it might be comic books, you never know.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s going to appeal more to a slice of the audience</p>
<p>rather than a more wide section.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m hoping that like in five years</p>
<p>when you look at the whole archives,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll be full of stuff that you might not care for,</p>
<p>but other things that you really think is,</p>
<p>oh, that&rsquo;s fun, that&rsquo;s really narrow,</p>
<p>I like that subject,</p>
<p>so 1950s science fiction comic books, my favorite.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s program, I&rsquo;m going to start it off with a question</p>
<p>and sort of progress from there if I can.</p>
<p>You know, these things aren&rsquo;t scripted,</p>
<p>so I don&rsquo;t always know where it goes.</p>
<p>I mean, for all I know, I&rsquo;m starting off with one idea</p>
<p>and this will be about 1950s science fiction comic books</p>
<p>by the end, so we will all see where this journey takes us.</p>
<p>But let me start with inviting you over</p>
<p>for a war game with me.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m talking about old school stuff,</p>
<p>this isn&rsquo;t computer deals, this is, you know,</p>
<p>we open up the trays and the boxes</p>
<p>and we pull out the miniatures.</p>
<p>Maybe we&rsquo;re going to have a battle</p>
<p>where I&rsquo;m going to pull out one tray for myself.</p>
<p>Maybe we&rsquo;ll take out a Second World War German army</p>
<p>or Soviet army from 1942.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to give you another tray and another box</p>
<p>and when you open it up, you see miniatures from armies</p>
<p>from 1914, the start of the First World War.</p>
<p>So, in other words, your friend Dan</p>
<p>then invited you over for a nice fair war game,</p>
<p>may the best man win or woman win,</p>
<p>and I take a middle Second World War army</p>
<p>and I give you a start of the First World War army.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like 25 years difference,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s practically cheating, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>You stand no chance.</p>
<p>I like to stack the deck, what can I say?</p>
<p>At this point, you would declare this to be unfair,</p>
<p>cite unsportsmanlike conduct and go home.</p>
<p>If, however, we decided we were going to play,</p>
<p>you know, what was always called ancients back in the day,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really anything pre-gunpowder,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to have a battle from the ancient period</p>
<p>and I pull out an army from 1066,</p>
<p>you know, pull out some Normans,</p>
<p>the army that invaded Britain</p>
<p>and deposed the Anglo-Saxon monarchy there, right?</p>
<p>1066.</p>
<p>And I give you an army from more than a thousand years earlier.</p>
<p>You may, depending on the army,</p>
<p>be perfectly willing to fight with it</p>
<p>and, in fact, think that I put myself at a disadvantage.</p>
<p>What if I gave you Alexander the Great&rsquo;s army</p>
<p>from three, let&rsquo;s just say 338,</p>
<p>throwing out a number there,</p>
<p>Macedonians against Normans?</p>
<p>Now, anybody that actually played war games</p>
<p>in the era that I did knows</p>
<p>that you were forced to fight battles like this all the time.</p>
<p>You were forced to fight alternative history battles</p>
<p>by the nature of the economics of the hobby.</p>
<p>Let me explain.</p>
<p>And see, this is where we go into territory</p>
<p>that a lot of people are going to go,</p>
<p>why do we care about this?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll check out another addendum show later</p>
<p>and hopefully it&rsquo;s your favorite topic when you do.</p>
<p>See you later.</p>
<p>Okay, for the rest of you.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll probably whittle down the audience</p>
<p>to 1950s science fiction comic book lovers by the end only.</p>
<p>Maybe only like Spanish language 1950s science fiction comic books</p>
<p>by the end.</p>
<p>But in this case, as I said,</p>
<p>every pre-gunpowder era war gamer from the 1970s, for example,</p>
<p>except for you total hardcores, was a fantasy war gamer.</p>
<p>Because we played 25 millimeter, first of all, folks,</p>
<p>which meant the figures were relatively big</p>
<p>and relatively expensive, especially if you were a kid.</p>
<p>Then you had to paint them yourself.</p>
<p>And that took a long time.</p>
<p>I mean, the whole process involved a loving commitment</p>
<p>to an army back in those days.</p>
<p>Lots of money, lots of time to build your army.</p>
<p>What were the odds that anybody else was building</p>
<p>a historical enemy for your army?</p>
<p>And the answer to that is it wasn&rsquo;t common.</p>
<p>Usually you&rsquo;d be fighting two armies</p>
<p>that never were anywhere close to each other on the map</p>
<p>and were from wildly different periods.</p>
<p>Because what choice did you have, right?</p>
<p>Romans against knights, not that unusual.</p>
<p>But the interesting question that has the larger impact</p>
<p>and is maybe more interesting for people</p>
<p>who aren&rsquo;t totally into this hobby,</p>
<p>like some of us have been,</p>
<p>is why if you have a First World War army from 1914,</p>
<p>totally outclassed to the point of it&rsquo;s not even worth</p>
<p>getting out the miniatures to fight a 1942 army,</p>
<p>you know, a quarter century difference,</p>
<p>why can a single period from the dawn of humanity</p>
<p>to about the Renaissance be covered</p>
<p>in the same War Games rule booklet?</p>
<p>Just for those of you who care, War Games research rules,</p>
<p>four, five, and six were the ones we played.</p>
<p>And if you look at those rules, by the last of them,</p>
<p>you have knights and Egyptian, you know,</p>
<p>pharaonic armies in the same rule booklet,</p>
<p>totally able to fight each other in a tournament, by the way.</p>
<p>Why is that?</p>
<p>See, that to me is the bigger societal question.</p>
<p>Because it says something about the pace of change</p>
<p>and a ton of other things that are integral</p>
<p>to why you get the kind of militaries in history</p>
<p>that you get.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s a lot of interesting books.</p>
<p>I read one by John Lynn, a historian who wrote Battle,</p>
<p>a history of combat and culture.</p>
<p>And he makes a point that we all understand,</p>
<p>but he wrote a whole book specifically pointing it out</p>
<p>about how the cultures of all these societies,</p>
<p>especially when you go back to periods</p>
<p>where militaries weren&rsquo;t standardized the way they are now.</p>
<p>Even though culture still plays a role,</p>
<p>you go look at a military in any country in the world</p>
<p>and it looks broadly similar to other militaries.</p>
<p>I mean, we have a sort of a standardized thing now.</p>
<p>You need to do to win.</p>
<p>Back in the day, it was much more exotic.</p>
<p>And militaries could really differ from one to another,</p>
<p>and especially region to region.</p>
<p>And so the culture had such an influence on the militaries</p>
<p>that it kind of determined at times how they even fought, right?</p>
<p>You might have a military that in terms of technology</p>
<p>and weapons and ferocity and numbers</p>
<p>and all these other factors was the equal of its opponent.</p>
<p>But because of some cultural question,</p>
<p>they were inhibited or maybe even enhanced.</p>
<p>How can one not think, for example,</p>
<p>of the Native American practice of counting coup</p>
<p>as a wonderful example of how a culture</p>
<p>can influence one&rsquo;s warfare?</p>
<p>Is that the smart thing to do from a military standpoint?</p>
<p>Probably not, but it&rsquo;s part of the culture.</p>
<p>And, you know, you lose something important</p>
<p>to the people who are involved if they don&rsquo;t do this.</p>
<p>And especially in the earlier period,</p>
<p>you see this in most militaries one way or the other.</p>
<p>I mean, try to figure out why the heck a knight is a knight</p>
<p>when it comes to their performance on the battlefield, right?</p>
<p>You start getting into all kinds of cultural questions.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s not just weapons systems and armor, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s other stuff going on, but good luck quantifying it</p>
<p>and good luck making a case.</p>
<p>And you can go back to what the people of the time thought,</p>
<p>but they were a bunch of, by today&rsquo;s standards,</p>
<p>racist, ethnocentric xenophobes.</p>
<p>I mean, who&rsquo;s going to believe those guys?</p>
<p>Of course they think there&rsquo;s something special</p>
<p>about themselves.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t do that these days, of course.</p>
<p>Not, of course not.</p>
<p>Now, just so you know, this is hardly a new idea.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just deciding to look at it in this particular program,</p>
<p>but people have been fascinated by this forever.</p>
<p>I mean, how many wonderful movie or TV themes</p>
<p>can we remember that play with this idea?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really alternative history or what-if history.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the category it falls into.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve probably mentioned before,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a perfect example of those movies</p>
<p>that are not good movies,</p>
<p>but because of what they&rsquo;re doing in the movie,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m hooked anyway.</p>
<p>The 1980 movie, The Final Countdown.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not a good movie, but if you like stuff</p>
<p>like I like stuff, it&rsquo;s worth checking out</p>
<p>because the premise is easy to understand.</p>
<p>You have the USS Nimitz, a super carrier.</p>
<p>When this movie&rsquo;s made in 1980,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s state-of-the-art, basically.</p>
<p>This was, by the way, sort of a half-publicity piece</p>
<p>for the U.S. Navy, so they cooperated,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s part of what made it so cool.</p>
<p>And so, the premise is that the USS Nimitz from 1980</p>
<p>gets in this weird storm that transports them back in time,</p>
<p>serendipitously enough,</p>
<p>to the day before the 1941 Pearl Harbor strike,</p>
<p>and they happen to be right in the vicinity.</p>
<p>So, as they figure out,</p>
<p>oh, my gosh, we&rsquo;ve been sent back in time,</p>
<p>and oh, my gosh, it&rsquo;s the day before Pearl Harbor,</p>
<p>and oh, my gosh, what can, you know&hellip;</p>
<p>You get this wonderful setup that&rsquo;s about to happen</p>
<p>as this movie goes on, right?</p>
<p>And they lead up to it great.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s a scene that, for people like me,</p>
<p>is worth the price of admission alone,</p>
<p>where you see 1980s-era jets</p>
<p>using missiles to down replicas of Zeros,</p>
<p>and, you know, this is pre-CGI,</p>
<p>so they&rsquo;re really flying these things.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s great, right?</p>
<p>But what you&rsquo;re setting up, of course,</p>
<p>is what everybody really wants to see,</p>
<p>which is the 1980 super carrier USS Nimitz</p>
<p>going to intercept the Japanese fleet</p>
<p>on the way to Pearl Harbor, right?</p>
<p>Does one 1980s super carrier</p>
<p>equal six Second World War,</p>
<p>early Second World War aircraft carriers</p>
<p>and corresponding fleet with them?</p>
<p>I think so, but we&rsquo;re going to find out, right,</p>
<p>as the final countdown goes on.</p>
<p>But then the storm comes back</p>
<p>and takes the Nimitz back to its own time period.</p>
<p>I like to call that time travel interruptus,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s nothing more unsatisfying</p>
<p>than not getting to see that battle.</p>
<p>But there are other television shows</p>
<p>and movie plots and premises&hellip;</p>
<p>Premises?</p>
<p>&hellip;that do the same thing.</p>
<p>I mean, who doesn&rsquo;t recall,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re an original Twilight Zone series fan,</p>
<p>as I am,</p>
<p>the episode that involved the Army Reservists</p>
<p>who were on maneuvers on the battlefield</p>
<p>where Custer&rsquo;s last stand happened,</p>
<p>the Battle of the Little Bighorn.</p>
<p>The plot is also simple.</p>
<p>These guys have a tank.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s like a World War II</p>
<p>leftover M3 Stuart light tank,</p>
<p>37 millimeter, three Browning machine guns,</p>
<p>but a light tank, right?</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re on maneuvers at the site</p>
<p>or right around the site</p>
<p>of the Battle of the Little Bighorn.</p>
<p>And as time goes on,</p>
<p>they, like the Nimitz in the final countdown,</p>
<p>begin to realize that they&rsquo;ve somehow</p>
<p>been transported back in time</p>
<p>and the Battle of the Little Bighorn</p>
<p>is unfolding, you know, nearby.</p>
<p>And, you know, more and more clues begin to surface,</p>
<p>the final clue being an arrow</p>
<p>between the shoulder blades</p>
<p>of one of these, you know, 1950s, 1960s Army Reservists.</p>
<p>And then at the end,</p>
<p>when they realize where they are,</p>
<p>they go back to their tank and they,</p>
<p>you know, I&rsquo;m going from memory here,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve seen it a million times,</p>
<p>they go back to their tank</p>
<p>and they pull out, like,</p>
<p>their submachine guns or whatever,</p>
<p>and they run off to the battlefield</p>
<p>in order to help.</p>
<p>And then the next scene is,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s something like the memorial</p>
<p>for the people who fell there, right?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s got all of, you know,</p>
<p>the Custer victims&rsquo; names on a plaque.</p>
<p>And on the plaque now are added</p>
<p>the three names of the modern Reservists.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s this, you know, puzzle.</p>
<p>And then the last scene is sort of showing</p>
<p>their commander as he figures out,</p>
<p>wow, they must have gone back in time.</p>
<p>And wow, they must have died at the battlefield</p>
<p>and fought there.</p>
<p>And then the last line is something</p>
<p>to the effect of,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s too bad they couldn&rsquo;t have brought the tank.</p>
<p>It might have made a difference</p>
<p>or something like that.</p>
<p>Well, of course,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the final countdown ending too.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t you want to see the 1M3</p>
<p>against, what was it, like 2,000, 2,500,</p>
<p>you know, Native American Plains warriors?</p>
<p>Truthfully, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s much of a battle.</p>
<p>As soon as they figure out</p>
<p>they have nothing to penetrate this thing with</p>
<p>and as it&rsquo;s mowing down natives,</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;re gone.</p>
<p>I think the morale breaks.</p>
<p>I think anybody&rsquo;s would.</p>
<p>But you still want to see it, don&rsquo;t you?</p>
<p>So, someday when I make this movie,</p>
<p>I was going to write a book,</p>
<p>maybe it&rsquo;ll be a movie someday,</p>
<p>called Fighting Out of Time.</p>
<p>And it was going to be these questions.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to do it as a podcast today instead</p>
<p>and sort of explore it a little bit.</p>
<p>But the idea would be to actually have that battle.</p>
<p>I mean, if you&rsquo;re going to have a great battle,</p>
<p>why not show it?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s fantasy,</p>
<p>and yet it&rsquo;s historical at the same time.</p>
<p>I mean, take, for example,</p>
<p>one of the wild ideas that blew my mind</p>
<p>when I first heard it.</p>
<p>And I first heard it in 1985.</p>
<p>It was not particularly new even then</p>
<p>because it involves two of the great military commanders</p>
<p>in history.</p>
<p>So, it is normal for people to compare them</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ve been doing so for a long time.</p>
<p>In this case, it&rsquo;s Napoleon and Alexander the Great.</p>
<p>The book that blew my mind on this was a book,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s called The Origins of War,</p>
<p>from the Stone Age to Alexander the Great</p>
<p>by military historian Arthur Farrell.</p>
<p>And at the time in the middle 1980s,</p>
<p>you know, I was, to get back to the wargaming thing,</p>
<p>I had an Achaemenid Persian army</p>
<p>and I had a Neo-Assyrian army</p>
<p>and getting updated information on either one of those</p>
<p>was nearly impossible.</p>
<p>And then in the 1980s, little bits of real information</p>
<p>began to trickle out again.</p>
<p>The first real glut of information</p>
<p>in like 20 or 30 years.</p>
<p>And this book had some of it.</p>
<p>So, I mean, I desperately needed this book.</p>
<p>But when you get to the last chapter,</p>
<p>in an effort to make his case</p>
<p>that Alexander the Great had brought warfare</p>
<p>to a point where it was modern enough</p>
<p>so that you could begin to make weird comparisons,</p>
<p>he tried to reimagine the Battle of Waterloo, right?</p>
<p>Early 1800s,</p>
<p>the Duke of Wellington with his Anglo-Dutch army on one side,</p>
<p>Napoleon back from exile, you know,</p>
<p>the comeback kid with his army,</p>
<p>the Prussians in the distance on the way.</p>
<p>Maybe the most written about battle in human history.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure. I think I read that somewhere.</p>
<p>But if not the most, one of the most,</p>
<p>which is why it gets studied so often, by the way,</p>
<p>because when you have this many accounts</p>
<p>from this many angles,</p>
<p>you can begin to piece things together really well.</p>
<p>And this is, by the way,</p>
<p>one of the earlier battles in relatively modern history</p>
<p>where people were able to do that.</p>
<p>And they did it with real interest,</p>
<p>especially for the rest of the 1800s,</p>
<p>because this was the ultimate battle of the age.</p>
<p>And a lot of veterans on multiple sides had fought there.</p>
<p>What Farrell does first</p>
<p>is try to imagine how Alexander the Great</p>
<p>would have done at that battle</p>
<p>if he were commanding Napoleon&rsquo;s army instead of Napoleon.</p>
<p>So this was part of his effort to show</p>
<p>that Alexander wouldn&rsquo;t have been daunted by the numbers</p>
<p>or the scale or the size of the battlefield or those things</p>
<p>because he had relatively similar numbers</p>
<p>and battlefield sizes and all that kind of stuff in his day.</p>
<p>Then Farrell goes on, however,</p>
<p>to do the part that just blows your mind</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re a person like me,</p>
<p>and tries to imagine, in order to make a point,</p>
<p>how Alexander would have done at the Battle of Waterloo</p>
<p>in place of Napoleon</p>
<p>if he also used his own army instead of Napoleon&rsquo;s French one.</p>
<p>This seems, on the surface, preposterous.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to replace early 1800s-era Napoleonic French</p>
<p>with Macedonians from something like the 330s BCE,</p>
<p>an army that was ancient by the standards of the Roman Empire?</p>
<p>Preposterous.</p>
<p>But maybe not as preposterous as you might think initially.</p>
<p>Farrell makes an interesting sort of a point,</p>
<p>and he does it with the usual disclaimers</p>
<p>you always have to do with counterfactuals</p>
<p>or alternative history.</p>
<p>For example, he concedes that the gunpowder</p>
<p>and the sound of explosives and stuff</p>
<p>would have a big impact on Alexander&rsquo;s troops</p>
<p>and the horses and all that.</p>
<p>So you take that out.</p>
<p>That becomes one of those things that you make allowances for.</p>
<p>You pretend that Alexander&rsquo;s Macedonians</p>
<p>had fought gunpowder before</p>
<p>and then try to measure how it would go.</p>
<p>But then it gets kind of interesting</p>
<p>because Farrell points out things that you might not consider.</p>
<p>For example, at my first thought,</p>
<p>you just think, how are Alexander&rsquo;s men</p>
<p>lined up shoulder to shoulder in these deep blocks</p>
<p>like, you know, so many bowling pins?</p>
<p>How are they going to get past all this musketry</p>
<p>and this cannons and everything like that?</p>
<p>But Farrell reminds us that at Waterloo,</p>
<p>Napoleon had a lot of infantry formations</p>
<p>that were formed up in column deeper than Alexander&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>And they still got right up to the Anglo-Dutch lines</p>
<p>before the Anglo-Dutch opened fire with their muskets.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about that for a minute.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a famous phrase you may recall</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re not supposed to fire</p>
<p>until you see the whites of the enemy&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s because the muskets, when used singly,</p>
<p>are pretty ineffective and inaccurate</p>
<p>during this time period.</p>
<p>But if you wait till someone&rsquo;s right in front of you</p>
<p>and you fire a whole bunch of them at once,</p>
<p>you can do great damage.</p>
<p>The problem always comes with the reloading,</p>
<p>because in this time period, that&rsquo;s a pretty slow process.</p>
<p>And even if you have ranks fire in sequence,</p>
<p>so the first rank fires, then kneels and begins to reload,</p>
<p>second rank fire, there&rsquo;s still these pauses</p>
<p>between the discharge of the weapons,</p>
<p>between the volleys.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s gonna happen during that lull</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s maybe going to make a difference here.</p>
<p>If the Duke of Wellington and his Anglo-Dutch forces</p>
<p>stand up from behind a ridge</p>
<p>at 20 yards or 15 yards</p>
<p>and opens fire at the Macedonian pikemen in front of them,</p>
<p>they may blow them away.</p>
<p>They did this against Napoleon&rsquo;s forces</p>
<p>and caused terrible trouble, right?</p>
<p>They could blow them away, so the same thing would happen.</p>
<p>No worse than how the French did, right?</p>
<p>But if they don&rsquo;t blow them away,</p>
<p>remember, unlike Napoleonic infantry,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not armed for combat, for hand-to-hand combat,</p>
<p>with a long musket and a knife on the end of it, a bayonet.</p>
<p>They have those 14-foot-long spears.</p>
<p>They have them arrayed in a formation</p>
<p>that makes them look like a hedgehog or a pincushion.</p>
<p>The Roman general, I think it was Aemilius Paulus,</p>
<p>described the sight of a phalanx, a pike phalanx,</p>
<p>advancing as absolutely terrifying.</p>
<p>And he didn&rsquo;t think it could be defeated on level ground</p>
<p>if it kept its formation.</p>
<p>What would that do to the thin lines of musketeers</p>
<p>if they ever got past that initial volley, right?</p>
<p>Charged at the run, which they were trained to do,</p>
<p>between the volleys in the interim?</p>
<p>Yikes.</p>
<p>And remember, unlike the Napoleonic infantry</p>
<p>they would be charging into,</p>
<p>they have armor and helmets.</p>
<p>They have swords for sidearms.</p>
<p>They are ready for hand-to-hand combat.</p>
<p>In fact, it&rsquo;s the only thing they do.</p>
<p>Farrell also points out that these skirmishers,</p>
<p>the people with slings and bows and arrows and javelins</p>
<p>fighting as light infantry people,</p>
<p>that they might do better against Napoleon&rsquo;s forces</p>
<p>than they did historically because historically</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re usually launching their sling stones</p>
<p>and arrows and javelins against people who have shields</p>
<p>or helmets or armor or all three.</p>
<p>The Napoleonic troops have none of those things,</p>
<p>so they may be more vulnerable than the ancient opponents</p>
<p>and targets of the skirmishers were.</p>
<p>Finally, you have the cavalry question,</p>
<p>and this is a big open-ended one because, you know,</p>
<p>you have the involvement of some technology here.</p>
<p>We talked about technology changing slowly,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a pre-stirrup and a post-stirrup period</p>
<p>when it comes to cavalry and stirrups,</p>
<p>and how much of a difference that makes is heavily debated.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you this, I think you&rsquo;d probably have,</p>
<p>and I could be wrong about this,</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;d probably have more good cavalry</p>
<p>on the Macedonian side, so even if they weren&rsquo;t able</p>
<p>to compete person by person,</p>
<p>I think they might outnumber them.</p>
<p>And I certainly think that if I&rsquo;m on horseback</p>
<p>with a 12-foot, nine to 12-foot lance,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d rather have that than a man on horseback</p>
<p>charging with a saber and, well, that&rsquo;s just me.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a personal preference question, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>My point is that it&rsquo;s both goofy and fascinating</p>
<p>because what does it say about development,</p>
<p>the pace of change, how cultures influence militaries?</p>
<p>I mean, it brings up some very interesting questions</p>
<p>like how could an army fighting more than 2,000 years</p>
<p>before the one fighting at the Battle of Waterloo</p>
<p>have any chance at all at the Battle of Waterloo</p>
<p>when you wouldn&rsquo;t stand a chance in hell against me</p>
<p>if you were using a 1914 army</p>
<p>and I was using a 1942 one?</p>
<p>You would like to say that it is a simple question</p>
<p>of the speeding up of the pace of change,</p>
<p>that once upon a time, change moved rather slowly</p>
<p>compared to today.</p>
<p>I mean, for example, they were using things like spears</p>
<p>and bows and arrows in warfare from prehistoric times</p>
<p>until right around the Middle Ages or the Renaissance,</p>
<p>even after the Renaissance.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a long time with certain elements in place,</p>
<p>technologically speaking.</p>
<p>You might argue, as many do,</p>
<p>that when the pace of change speeds up,</p>
<p>usually dated to around the middle 1800s,</p>
<p>right, middle of the 19th century,</p>
<p>think US Civil War, think Franco-Prussian War in Europe,</p>
<p>that from that moment on, technology speeds up to a point</p>
<p>where armies need to stay technologically current or lose.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not to say that they didn&rsquo;t need to before.</p>
<p>It just became a much more overriding issue.</p>
<p>And you see that, by the way,</p>
<p>if you look at any of the major wars from the 1850s onward,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s the beginning of the war where there&rsquo;s a sort of shock</p>
<p>as everyone&rsquo;s getting accustomed to the power</p>
<p>of the new weaponry and trying to learn how to use it</p>
<p>and integrate it into systems and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>You see that in each of these wars,</p>
<p>just this utter shock at what 10 years</p>
<p>or 20 years of change has wrought on the old rules.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s about this time period,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m not saying that the saying dates from that,</p>
<p>but that the idea of generals are always fighting the last war</p>
<p>seems to be relevant,</p>
<p>because this is where fighting the last war can get you killed.</p>
<p>Fighting the last war didn&rsquo;t get you killed</p>
<p>through most of human history.</p>
<p>Fighting the last war was often the best way</p>
<p>to fight the next war, especially if you did well.</p>
<p>If you are a Roman general,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s not that much going to change in your lifetime</p>
<p>on the basics of war.</p>
<p>If you are a general, if you&rsquo;re a soldier in 1914</p>
<p>who ends up being a general in 1945,</p>
<p>look at all the change that went on in your life.</p>
<p>So the pressure&rsquo;s been on the modern generals, right,</p>
<p>to try to adapt quickly to a pace of change</p>
<p>that earlier generals never had to deal with.</p>
<p>And of course, the funny thing is we moderns</p>
<p>can relate to their situation more easily</p>
<p>than we can relate to, say, the Roman general situation,</p>
<p>because we understand the accelerated pace of change</p>
<p>intrinsically, don&rsquo;t we?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s such a part of our modern lives</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s become difficult to try to imagine</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s ever been otherwise,</p>
<p>and yet it&rsquo;s only been this way for a relatively short period of time.</p>
<p>That, to me, when you start thinking about</p>
<p>how human history has been for most of human history</p>
<p>and it begins to sound like science fiction,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when you know we live in really interesting times, right?</p>
<p>I mean, take, for example, this pace of change question.</p>
<p>Forget the fact that it can sometimes seemingly move backwards, right,</p>
<p>and knowledge can get lost in certain places at certain times,</p>
<p>and capabilities can go down</p>
<p>like a civilizational stock market in decline.</p>
<p>Forget all that for a second.</p>
<p>And, you know, I love those things.</p>
<p>I mean, I can hardly keep from just going off on tangents on those,</p>
<p>but I do that enough on other shows.</p>
<p>Check them out if you haven&rsquo;t already.</p>
<p>But just focus on all the ramifications</p>
<p>that happen in a society when knowledge,</p>
<p>especially things like technological knowledge,</p>
<p>when those things stay current for much longer swaths of time.</p>
<p>I mean, here&rsquo;s an analogy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s science fiction,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s more representative of human history</p>
<p>than the way we live now.</p>
<p>Imagine if we today were still using&hellip;</p>
<p>And you got to, you know, don&rsquo;t give me these notes saying,</p>
<p>go, you wouldn&rsquo;t, the viruses we would have by now,</p>
<p>you have no idea.</p>
<p>Imagine we were still using the computers from 1995.</p>
<p>Windows 95 on every desktop except for you people</p>
<p>that have the early apples running around your office.</p>
<p>But my point being, imagine that we are very little changed</p>
<p>from the technology of when computers first became something</p>
<p>a lot of people had in their homes.</p>
<p>If you were a person who began using computers back in 1995,</p>
<p>or for that matter, 2005,</p>
<p>think about how competent you&rsquo;d be on this operating system by now.</p>
<p>Right? Think about what a guru</p>
<p>these old people would be in any of these companies</p>
<p>simply because of the hours of experience</p>
<p>they had accrued over a long lifetime</p>
<p>using the same operating system that you&rsquo;re using today,</p>
<p>you know, as a 17-year-old hacker.</p>
<p>Now, instead of talking about computers and operating systems,</p>
<p>imagine if we&rsquo;re talking about weapons and warfare.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a sort of a physics to the pre-modern battlefield</p>
<p>that remains relatively constant over time.</p>
<p>I mean, this is why Arthur Ferrell thought to put Alexander in charge</p>
<p>of Napoleon&rsquo;s troops, because he wouldn&rsquo;t have been daunted</p>
<p>by the scope and the scale and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Well, the pre-gunpowder especially era,</p>
<p>there are limitations on human and animal muscle power, for example.</p>
<p>Space, range.</p>
<p>I mean, think about the speed.</p>
<p>The fastest thing on a battlefield in the biblical era of warfare</p>
<p>is a horse.</p>
<p>The fastest thing on the battlefield in the Civil War era</p>
<p>of the United States in the middle 1800s is a horse.</p>
<p>So, these sorts of things meant that the realities</p>
<p>the generals dealt with in terms of limitations and speed</p>
<p>and how things moved and the amount of food everybody ate</p>
<p>and all that kind of stuff were the same for the Romans</p>
<p>as they were for, you know, the Chinese and the Tang Dynasty.</p>
<p>And this is why, if I pull out my 25 millimeter ancients</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m feeling magnanimous and I allow you to pick which side you want</p>
<p>and I pull out an army from 1066</p>
<p>and I pull out another army from 54 BCE,</p>
<p>so about a thousand years, a little bit more apart,</p>
<p>and I say, pick whichever one you want and we&rsquo;ll fight,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a sucker&rsquo;s game if you pick the later army.</p>
<p>Now, of course, it depends on what the later army is.</p>
<p>In this case, what if we picked two armies</p>
<p>that both successfully invaded Britain?</p>
<p>My Normans from 1066 that fought at the Battle of Hastings,</p>
<p>often referred to as the last outside power to ever conquer Britain,</p>
<p>and Julius Caesar&rsquo;s Romans who did it in 54 BCE,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s often referred to as the first person to do it,</p>
<p>although there was probably some Celtic person in prehistory</p>
<p>that did it first, but you know what I mean.</p>
<p>What if those two armies fought each other</p>
<p>instead of the opponents they actually did?</p>
<p>Now, first of all, tell me you&rsquo;re not buying a ticket for the movie</p>
<p>to watch that play out on the screen.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m going to a movie to watch a 1980s jet</p>
<p>shoot down a Second World War Japanese Zero.</p>
<p>I sure as heck am going to go watch legionaries take on,</p>
<p>you know, Norman proto-knights.</p>
<p>But, you know, beyond just the geeking out about history,</p>
<p>this sort of a square off has all kinds of interesting overtones</p>
<p>concerning the pace of change that I&rsquo;m not sure you can,</p>
<p>you know, conclusively label in any single direction,</p>
<p>but just take, for example, the fact that if those two armies</p>
<p>actually met, it&rsquo;s going to be the earlier army</p>
<p>that has the higher level of capability in most of the categories.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re an ancients fan like I am,</p>
<p>you may just have already internalized that to the point</p>
<p>where you don&rsquo;t even notice it anymore,</p>
<p>but think about how strange it would be</p>
<p>if we said that same thing today.</p>
<p>I mean, what if we could put a man on Mars 500 years ago,</p>
<p>but we can&rsquo;t quite do that again yet?</p>
<p>As weird as that would be to us living today,</p>
<p>there were lots of periods in human history</p>
<p>where at least somewhere else in the world,</p>
<p>there were civilizations that were dead and gone</p>
<p>that had capabilities above your own,</p>
<p>however you want to define that.</p>
<p>In this particular situation, we are defining it in terms</p>
<p>of the army that ends up on the field.</p>
<p>And in this case, both of those armies,</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re on opposite sides of a battlefield,</p>
<p>are representatives of the civilization and society</p>
<p>that supports them and that raises them</p>
<p>and that creates a system that results in them.</p>
<p>I mean, for example, the Roman system</p>
<p>is a highly organized system.</p>
<p>The British would call it, in my War Games research rules,</p>
<p>a regular military.</p>
<p>You know, they are drilled the way our military is.</p>
<p>They have regular pay, they have engineers</p>
<p>and cooks and logistics people.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s an entire operation that goes on</p>
<p>generation after generation.</p>
<p>Officers, ranks, all these kind of things.</p>
<p>The Duke of Normandy&rsquo;s army is something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s totally different.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a reflection of the society it comes from.</p>
<p>First of all, it is a rigidly structured society</p>
<p>in terms of people&rsquo;s place,</p>
<p>although not as rigidly structured</p>
<p>as it would be 200 years from now.</p>
<p>And where you were in the society determined</p>
<p>how you fought, what your role on the battlefield was.</p>
<p>I mean, think about the Japanese and the samurai.</p>
<p>Is that necessarily the best military</p>
<p>that country can come up with? No, but it&rsquo;s the one</p>
<p>that matches the societal conditions and the hierarchy</p>
<p>and all these other aspects of the culture</p>
<p>that ends up playing into the military.</p>
<p>Now, things are so standardized that a Chinese military,</p>
<p>a Brazilian military, a U.S. military</p>
<p>look more alike than different.</p>
<p>But in the pre-modern era, it got really exotic,</p>
<p>especially place to place and region to region.</p>
<p>I know I said that already, but it bears repeating.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of the main attractions of the period</p>
<p>from a wargaming standpoint.</p>
<p>Because even when you&rsquo;re looking at something</p>
<p>like Napoleon&rsquo;s era or the U.S. Civil War,</p>
<p>I mean, both sides are wearing uniforms</p>
<p>that are relatively similar.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s not all that different.</p>
<p>But you go to the ancients period and you&rsquo;ve got&hellip;</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;ll be elephants on the battlefield.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;ll be people in armor. There&rsquo;ll be tribesmen.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;ll be everything you can think of.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very colorful, very different.</p>
<p>The armies are really, um, there&rsquo;s a discordant feel</p>
<p>to the whole thing, but it&rsquo;s part of the attraction.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a much more rigid, standardized way</p>
<p>of doing things, even by Napoleon&rsquo;s time.</p>
<p>Um, the kind of soldier that the early middle ages produced</p>
<p>is going to be what the wargames research rules</p>
<p>of my day would have called an irregular soldier.</p>
<p>Irregular meaning not that they were, uh,</p>
<p>that there was something wrong with them,</p>
<p>but that they were trained differently</p>
<p>than people like the Romans, or for that matter,</p>
<p>people like the militaries today.</p>
<p>You think of a tribal warrior, or you think of someone</p>
<p>who comes from a hereditary warrior class,</p>
<p>uh, where training is sort of based on your place</p>
<p>in the society, a knight.</p>
<p>An upper class warrior.</p>
<p>These are people whose, um, training with weapons</p>
<p>and fighting is in no way necessarily inferior</p>
<p>to someone like the Romans, or someone like the Macedonians.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just trained differently.</p>
<p>On a one-to-one level, they might be superior.</p>
<p>Would you rather face your average Macedonian spearman,</p>
<p>or would you rather face a knight?</p>
<p>On the other hand, would you rather face a unit of knights,</p>
<p>or a unit of Macedonian spearmen?</p>
<p>I mean, once you start talking about units moving together,</p>
<p>and all that sort of stuff, it&rsquo;s a different argument.</p>
<p>Um, but the armies of the early Middle Ages</p>
<p>in Western Europe were irregular armies.</p>
<p>They were ad hoc armies,</p>
<p>meaning they were thrown together for battles.</p>
<p>Uh, sometimes you&rsquo;d get lucky and have some training.</p>
<p>The, uh, Duke of Normandy famously is supposed</p>
<p>to have gotten some training time in</p>
<p>before he crossed the channel, and a little bit afterwards.</p>
<p>So, by the standards of his day, he&rsquo;s bringing</p>
<p>a somewhat trained and somewhat cohesive army</p>
<p>across the channel.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, he&rsquo;s facing a very trained</p>
<p>and very cohesive army, and trained as an army.</p>
<p>I was trying to think about how&hellip;</p>
<p>we should structure this movie.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to look at it from, you know,</p>
<p>Dan Carlin, filmmaker, screenwriter,</p>
<p>showrunner, uh, standpoint.</p>
<p>And, uh, if you figure that probably the way</p>
<p>the Battle of Hastings happened,</p>
<p>although there are some dissenters,</p>
<p>is that the Normans cross the channel,</p>
<p>arrive, and they find the Anglo-Saxons</p>
<p>waiting for them on the famous hill nearby Hastings.</p>
<p>So, we&rsquo;re going to assume that the Romans</p>
<p>also get there first.</p>
<p>I mean, they were there a thousand years earlier.</p>
<p>I assume they had time to set up.</p>
<p>And in my movie, uh, I haven&rsquo;t walked to the ground</p>
<p>and measured this and thought it out,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m just going to assume the battle does not take place</p>
<p>in the same spot in the movie that it did historically,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s a lot more Romans</p>
<p>than there were Anglo-Saxons.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure a guy like Julius Caesar</p>
<p>is going to be able to deploy his army</p>
<p>where the Anglo-Saxons deployed.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not enough room.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where we should start this movie.</p>
<p>How much room do you need?</p>
<p>In 54 BCE, Caesar took five legions</p>
<p>across the channel</p>
<p>in what the ancient sources say were six to eight hundred ships.</p>
<p>Think about that for a minute in your mind&rsquo;s eye.</p>
<p>And an ancient society doing this.</p>
<p>And in fact, Caesar had his people go to work</p>
<p>and produce this fleet over a winter.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the winters here.</p>
<p>By the end of winter, you have six to eight hundred ships,</p>
<p>some of which are capable of carrying lots of horses.</p>
<p>The English Channel is no picnic,</p>
<p>no matter when you want to cross it.</p>
<p>And when in 54 BCE, Caesar crossed it,</p>
<p>he had crossed it the year before.</p>
<p>The first time the Romans get word of what lies</p>
<p>beyond the ends of the earth in, you know,</p>
<p>this misty area that no one actually knows about.</p>
<p>And, you know, tribesmen have been going back and forth</p>
<p>forever, but no civilized man from the Mediterranean</p>
<p>has ever gone and explored like Davy Crockett</p>
<p>this mysterious land.</p>
<p>And so in 55 BCE, with a smaller force,</p>
<p>Caesar goes over there, writes about this.</p>
<p>We should take a little sidebar tangent moment</p>
<p>to point out that if you ever wanted to get started</p>
<p>and read some great ancient history,</p>
<p>you could do a lot worse than starting with Caesar.</p>
<p>Remember, this is a guy who&rsquo;s writing his war memoirs</p>
<p>in real time, sort of surrealized,</p>
<p>like, you know, someone would do for a magazine today,</p>
<p>where you get one chapter at a time of the magazine</p>
<p>as he&rsquo;s writing it or as his people are writing it.</p>
<p>And Caesar&rsquo;s on campaign here.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s part conqueror, part politician on the rise,</p>
<p>part ethnographer, part Charles Darwin,</p>
<p>and part Lewis and Clark as he goes across</p>
<p>and thrills the readers at home with tales</p>
<p>of what lies beyond, you know, the ends of the earth.</p>
<p>In 55 BCE, depending on your view of Caesar,</p>
<p>either because he was just launching a reconnaissance</p>
<p>and always planned to come back,</p>
<p>or because he underestimated how many people he&rsquo;d need</p>
<p>for the job and was sort of defeated,</p>
<p>Caesar comes back in 54 with a conquest army.</p>
<p>Five legions, that&rsquo;s 25,000 men or something.</p>
<p>Probably understrength, because let&rsquo;s recall</p>
<p>that this is just a little side gig for Caesar at this time.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s in the process of conquering all of Gaul</p>
<p>and punching the Germans in the nose a couple times</p>
<p>during the process.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s the big deal, the main show.</p>
<p>This is a sidebar gig.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like that big band that comes into play,</p>
<p>New York or L.A., but you know,</p>
<p>you got to pay the hotel bills the night before</p>
<p>you do something over in Bakersfield or, you know, Roanoke.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a little irony on two aspects</p>
<p>of this Caesar expedition.</p>
<p>One is that this conquest of Gaul he&rsquo;s involved in</p>
<p>is going to include the very areas</p>
<p>that these Normans will come from eventually.</p>
<p>So Caesar&rsquo;s conquering it during this time period.</p>
<p>So maybe this is the Normans coming back, you know,</p>
<p>as descendants, trying to prevent the original conquest</p>
<p>of their territory.</p>
<p>The other thing that&rsquo;s worth pointing out</p>
<p>is that the real Battle of Hastings,</p>
<p>both sides probably approached the battlefield</p>
<p>on centuries-old roads built by the Romans</p>
<p>that were still better than anyone was producing locally</p>
<p>since they left, so a little irony there.</p>
<p>In the historical situation, of course,</p>
<p>as pointed out in Caesar&rsquo;s memoirs,</p>
<p>he portrays the inhabitants, these Britons,</p>
<p>as very similar to the Gauls in what&rsquo;s now modern-day France,</p>
<p>but with their own little cultural differences.</p>
<p>One, they were still using chariots,</p>
<p>which were antiquated over on the continent by then,</p>
<p>so running around with horse-drawn chariots.</p>
<p>And they also painted themselves blue with woad,</p>
<p>which made them look somewhat different</p>
<p>than most of the Gauls on the continent.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, there was so much cultural transmission</p>
<p>over the English Channel that sometimes the Gaulic tribes</p>
<p>in the very north of France had a lot of similarities,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s sort of how Caesar kind of saw them,</p>
<p>similar, but slightly different.</p>
<p>The Romans basically had no problems</p>
<p>in field battles with them at all,</p>
<p>so the Britons resorted to the same tried-and-true strategy</p>
<p>that most peoples do when they can&rsquo;t field</p>
<p>a field army that&rsquo;s competitive.</p>
<p>They go guerrilla and non-traditional,</p>
<p>and Caesar&rsquo;s left trying to deal with what appears,</p>
<p>if you read between the lines,</p>
<p>to be a rather vicious counterinsurgency war</p>
<p>of the sort you saw all through the 20th century, for example.</p>
<p>And the Romans were very good at these, by the way.</p>
<p>It sounds particularly vicious,</p>
<p>and then Caesar throws in a few friendly leaders,</p>
<p>signs a few whatever passes for, like,</p>
<p>deals or contracts or agreements,</p>
<p>crosses back across the Channel</p>
<p>and gets back to his main task, which is conquering Gaul,</p>
<p>and then going and really becoming the guy</p>
<p>who brings down the Roman Republic, right?</p>
<p>So, a lot of stuff ahead for Caesar,</p>
<p>no time to mess around in Britain,</p>
<p>and it was an easy task dealing with any field battles.</p>
<p>Now, we should point out something about field battles,</p>
<p>because I think in our little comparison here, it matters.</p>
<p>Caesar probably fought more field battles</p>
<p>than anybody you can think of from that era.</p>
<p>Famously, he&rsquo;s supposed to have fought over 50.</p>
<p>Fifty field battles is so much,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard to get your mind around</p>
<p>compared to the people that are considered to be in his class.</p>
<p>I mean, think about a guy like Alexander the Great.</p>
<p>You can argue, depending on how you want to classify</p>
<p>what constitutes a field battle,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a formal battle where both sides sort of line up</p>
<p>and get to it.</p>
<p>Adrian Goldsworthy gives Alexander five field battles.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not unreasonable,</p>
<p>but compare that to more than 50 for Caesar.</p>
<p>Caesar&rsquo;s battles were also huge,</p>
<p>and this matters in our comparison</p>
<p>about the pace of change.</p>
<p>Caesar, and again, you have to allow for exaggeration</p>
<p>and all the sorts of stuff that come with these numbers,</p>
<p>but even if you take the low numbers,</p>
<p>Caesar&rsquo;s battles would all be considered to be very large</p>
<p>by William the Conqueror&rsquo;s standards in that time period.</p>
<p>Now, some of you might make a case,</p>
<p>and I think you&rsquo;d have a good one,</p>
<p>that this is a bit of an apples and oranges comparison here</p>
<p>because we are comparing a society like Caesar&rsquo;s</p>
<p>and urban, dense civilization of imperial size and strength</p>
<p>to a small feudal territory.</p>
<p>The Duke of Normandy was in control of the resources,</p>
<p>manpower, and territory of something</p>
<p>that would be too small to be a Roman province</p>
<p>in their republic or empire.</p>
<p>So if you compare them to, say, the Song Chinese in 1066,</p>
<p>a similar kind of organized people</p>
<p>capable of putting large numbers of organized people</p>
<p>into armies and then feeding them and caring for them</p>
<p>and all that kind of stuff,</p>
<p>might be a better comparison.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;d be an interesting battle, by the way.</p>
<p>Worth saying, though, that in 1066,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s one of those periods where no&hellip;</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have any great armies dominating the scene,</p>
<p>and even the Song Chinese are at one of their low points,</p>
<p>having the traditional Chinese problems</p>
<p>with the northern barbarians,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a particularly bad time.</p>
<p>I consider to be, along with many others,</p>
<p>I think the Normans are one of the better armies</p>
<p>in the period, but they&rsquo;re really different.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re a feudal society taking on a society</p>
<p>much more like our own, probably,</p>
<p>than the Norman one was.</p>
<p>Now, the Norman army that William the Conqueror</p>
<p>brought over has been compared by some people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a bad analogy.</p>
<p>His expedition&rsquo;s been compared to some sort of,</p>
<p>like, a venture capitalist entrepreneurial kind of thing,</p>
<p>a profit-sharing deal where, you know,</p>
<p>anyone who wanted to get in on this, you sign up.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to go over there. It&rsquo;s speculative.</p>
<p>But if I win and if I become the king of this territory,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll parcel it up and you&rsquo;ll get a piece</p>
<p>commiserate with the amount of investments you put in.</p>
<p>And that might mean, you know,</p>
<p>how many men did you bring with you?</p>
<p>Because William the Conqueror is going to conquer</p>
<p>the British Isles with an ad hoc army,</p>
<p>which was pretty much the way that they did things,</p>
<p>you know, at that time and at that place.</p>
<p>These people often fought a lot.</p>
<p>A guy like William the Conqueror fought a lot,</p>
<p>just like Caesar did, but most of the battles</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s going to have been involved in</p>
<p>are going to be very different kinds of affairs.</p>
<p>Sieges, ambushes, you know, looting, raiding,</p>
<p>anti-guerrilla looting and raiding,</p>
<p>small-scale battles just between heavy cavalry.</p>
<p>I mean, a lot of these battles,</p>
<p>if you look at the history of the early Middle Ages,</p>
<p>or what used to be called the late Dark Ages,</p>
<p>now late antiquity, you&rsquo;ll see these battles</p>
<p>between like, you know, 500 heavy cavalry on one side</p>
<p>and 800 heavy cavalry on the other side,</p>
<p>and they just left the infantry at home.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a battle.</p>
<p>In Julius Caesar&rsquo;s day and at, you know, in his world,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a skirmish.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t count as one of his 50-plus battles,</p>
<p>but it counts as one of William the Conqueror&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s pretty darn likely that when William the Conqueror</p>
<p>shows up at the British Isles,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s commanding the largest number of human beings</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s ever commanded, maybe by a lot.</p>
<p>And the numbers are all over the map, typical of the era.</p>
<p>You get some low numbers at like 5,000.</p>
<p>8,000 is more often the low.</p>
<p>You get some high numbers at like 17,000.</p>
<p>A lot of people put it in the 11,000, 12,000 range,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not quite understood how many of these people</p>
<p>are considered to be combatants versus noncombatants.</p>
<p>Both sides have noncombatants.</p>
<p>The Romans are employing cooks</p>
<p>and people who do the armor repair.</p>
<p>I mean, they&rsquo;ve got giant cities attached</p>
<p>to each of these legions, basically.</p>
<p>And every night, let&rsquo;s recall, they build a camp,</p>
<p>and the camp to the Normans</p>
<p>would look like a giant fortified city.</p>
<p>And every day that that camp stays in the same place,</p>
<p>the Romans fortify it and make it more permanent.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one of the things that someone like William</p>
<p>is going to have to deal with.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s got a bunch of, as we were saying,</p>
<p>entrepreneurial partners</p>
<p>who are not under his direct command</p>
<p>other than by agreement, right?</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t order them around at a certain point.</p>
<p>You know, you piss off some of these other people</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re going to be contingents of nobility</p>
<p>and higher class people from France and among the Bretons</p>
<p>and these other people that will come over.</p>
<p>You know, William&rsquo;s got to kind of be&hellip;</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t be too hard-ass.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t be too General Patton with them</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re there because they want to be there.</p>
<p>Or because they owe him a favor, or whatever it might be.</p>
<p>These are the people, by the way,</p>
<p>that are going to be something</p>
<p>that William&rsquo;s going to rely on in this.</p>
<p>In this encounter, if we are setting up</p>
<p>the tail of the tape here before this encounter,</p>
<p>William the Conqueror&rsquo;s army,</p>
<p>because, you know, I like the boxing analogies,</p>
<p>reminds me of, like, Mike Tyson</p>
<p>in the later years of his career.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not very dangerous in any of the other ways</p>
<p>that he used to be, but he&rsquo;s still got this left hook,</p>
<p>this punch that will just ruin you,</p>
<p>no matter who you are.</p>
<p>You know, under the right conditions, you will lose.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t underestimate, you know, what the striking arm</p>
<p>of William the Conqueror&rsquo;s army can do.</p>
<p>And the striking arm are these proto-knights.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s call them proto-knights</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re not really knights yet.</p>
<p>When people think of knights,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re thinking of the knights of the high Middle Ages.</p>
<p>Say, the 1300s, or the 1400s, or maybe even the 1500s.</p>
<p>These mounted tanks on giant horses</p>
<p>who charge with a lance underneath their arm</p>
<p>in a fashion known as couched.</p>
<p>These are not them.</p>
<p>They are on the way to becoming them.</p>
<p>I like to think of, you know, because I do,</p>
<p>I like to think of European cavalry</p>
<p>as sort of progressing through stages.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s remember, it is the Romans and the Greeks</p>
<p>who first write about encountering these people</p>
<p>north of them in what we would consider to be,</p>
<p>you know, Central and Western and Northern Europe.</p>
<p>And the first cavalry that they encounter</p>
<p>from these regions that will continue to produce cavalry</p>
<p>over these eras, I like to call it European cavalry 1.0.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the Gallic cavalry.</p>
<p>The various sorts of cavalry, although, you know,</p>
<p>probably their great, great, great, great grandfathers</p>
<p>that Caesar is both fighting against in his wars in Gaul</p>
<p>in 54 and the 50s BCE, and using in his own army.</p>
<p>During Caesar&rsquo;s period, they didn&rsquo;t have their own cavalry</p>
<p>or not much of it anymore.</p>
<p>They used what were called auxiliary cavalry.</p>
<p>They used locals. They used mercenaries.</p>
<p>They used people they could hire or people that wanted to fight</p>
<p>or people that owed them, you know,</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;d conquered previously.</p>
<p>And Caesar will have 2,000 Gallic cavalry with him</p>
<p>when he invades Britain</p>
<p>and when he fights William the Conqueror in our film.</p>
<p>I consider that to be European cavalry 1.0.</p>
<p>I only bring them up at this moment</p>
<p>to point out the difference between they</p>
<p>and this cavalry of the early Middle Ages,</p>
<p>these Normans, these Proto-Knights,</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re more like European cavalry 3.0.</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s say European cavalry 2.0, the middle one,</p>
<p>is that Gothic cavalry,</p>
<p>the stuff from what we used to call the Dark Ages,</p>
<p>the stuff that was involved, you know,</p>
<p>in the latter parts of the Roman Empire and afterwards,</p>
<p>call that 2.0.</p>
<p>And so, by this time, you have this Norman cavalry.</p>
<p>And unlike most of European cavalry 1.0,</p>
<p>these Normans and these French and these Bretons,</p>
<p>all this Western European heavy cavalry</p>
<p>made up of generally, you know, the higher-class warriors,</p>
<p>these guys are all going to have armor from head to thigh.</p>
<p>Male, you know, interlocked rings,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll have neck pieces of it.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll wear the traditional&hellip;</p>
<p>This was really the traditional helmet of the&hellip;</p>
<p>Again, they used to call it the Viking era</p>
<p>in European military history.</p>
<p>You saw it all the time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a conical helmet, like a cone,</p>
<p>that they wear on their head.</p>
<p>And then it either has or doesn&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>the nose piece, the nasal,</p>
<p>the strip of metal that follows the nose,</p>
<p>you know, all the way from sort of the tip up to the&hellip;</p>
<p>You know, between the eyes.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s one of the more obvious pieces of armor</p>
<p>in terms of what it&rsquo;s intended to do.</p>
<p>I mean, you don&rsquo;t have to be very imaginative</p>
<p>to just see that, oh, yeah, that&rsquo;s to prevent somebody</p>
<p>from slashing across your face sideways with a sword strike.</p>
<p>One of the major things that happened</p>
<p>during this period, by the way.</p>
<p>So, these Norman and Breton and French proto-knights</p>
<p>would also carry what was called a kite shield,</p>
<p>which looks like a giant teardrop,</p>
<p>an extended teardrop.</p>
<p>They carried a nine-foot lance,</p>
<p>or somewhere around nine feet.</p>
<p>How they used it seemed to depend on the&hellip;</p>
<p>either the man himself or one of many styles.</p>
<p>Because the Bayeux Tapestry,</p>
<p>which is an account of the Battle of Hastings,</p>
<p>which people actually made,</p>
<p>shows a lot of these sorts of elements of the battle.</p>
<p>What they were armed and armored like,</p>
<p>how they rode up and did things.</p>
<p>And they show these proto-knights,</p>
<p>some of them are using the spears</p>
<p>in the fashion that they will later on,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re throwing them, big nine-foot spears,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re throwing them, they&rsquo;re using them overhand.</p>
<p>So, it seems like, once again,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not quite at this period where later on</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to have these medieval knights</p>
<p>with the lance under the arm.</p>
<p>You have these proto-knights.</p>
<p>In addition to that, let&rsquo;s not think about them</p>
<p>riding these massive, scary war horses,</p>
<p>which will be something that does happen later on,</p>
<p>although that might be overplayed.</p>
<p>But in this period, historian John France</p>
<p>is one of the people that suggests</p>
<p>that these horses might have been a lot smaller</p>
<p>than we think in most cases,</p>
<p>not all cases, but most cases.</p>
<p>I mean, he gives a possible size as like 12 hands high,</p>
<p>doing the measurements from the artwork.</p>
<p>Twelve hands high, he points out,</p>
<p>is, you know, a Shetland pony is ten hands high.</p>
<p>So, this is not your knights of the Middle Ages.</p>
<p>When William the Conqueror shows up to fight the locals,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s fighting a bunch of people who represent</p>
<p>the predominant troop type of the,</p>
<p>you know, era that&rsquo;s coming to an end.</p>
<p>A lot of people used to put, you know,</p>
<p>in the good old days, the Viking era ends</p>
<p>and the era of the Middle Ages begins</p>
<p>at the Battle of Hastings,</p>
<p>as though you could have a moment like that,</p>
<p>there was such a clean break.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s how it used to be portrayed.</p>
<p>If you think about all the people</p>
<p>that fought at the Battle of Hastings</p>
<p>as sort of looking like things from the Viking age,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not a bad visual image.</p>
<p>The Anglo-Saxon forces that William defeated</p>
<p>at that crucial battle, you know, once again,</p>
<p>the emphasis on English in European history</p>
<p>being what it is, it was always touted as,</p>
<p>you know, open up a book,</p>
<p>one of the most important battles of all human history.</p>
<p>Well, nowadays, when you rank it amongst all the battles</p>
<p>that are out there, it&rsquo;s fallen quite a bit.</p>
<p>But even when I was a kid,</p>
<p>this was one of these great important battles of all time.</p>
<p>When William shows up at the site</p>
<p>where this battle was fought,</p>
<p>he finds something like 10,000</p>
<p>of the locals awaiting him on a hill.</p>
<p>These Anglo-Saxons, these English,</p>
<p>these Proto-English, I&rsquo;m not sure what stage</p>
<p>we could definitively refer to them by at this point,</p>
<p>had just come from fighting another battle.</p>
<p>And people differ as to whether or not</p>
<p>this was just sort of luck on William&rsquo;s part</p>
<p>to show up when he did, good timing,</p>
<p>or whether or not he knew about all this</p>
<p>and was taking advantage of the fact</p>
<p>that there was a Viking, actually,</p>
<p>wrong word for it by this period,</p>
<p>a Norse invasion of the north of the British Isles.</p>
<p>And the Anglo-Saxon king, the monarchy,</p>
<p>they went up there, they brought the army,</p>
<p>they raised the troops, and they fought these Norse</p>
<p>up north, and they had one of those battles</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s a glorious victory,</p>
<p>and they decimated the other side,</p>
<p>but they really took it on the chin in doing so,</p>
<p>and then immediately had to run down</p>
<p>because news that William had landed</p>
<p>and was going to move on London had reached them.</p>
<p>And so they basically ran down the length</p>
<p>of the British Isles to get to the site at Hastings,</p>
<p>blocking William from his goal.</p>
<p>But the whole army hadn&rsquo;t made it yet.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re kind of strung out over the length and breadth.</p>
<p>They raised some locals, but it seems like</p>
<p>they were trying to get their act together</p>
<p>at the last minute, and so when William arrives</p>
<p>on the battlefield, he looks up, and on this hill,</p>
<p>this famous hill, you find the Anglo-Saxon army,</p>
<p>what there is of it, awaiting him.</p>
<p>Like I said, maybe 10,000 people.</p>
<p>The best part of it are a bunch of people</p>
<p>that seem like Viking house carls.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re Anglo-Saxon house carls.</p>
<p>These are professional troops,</p>
<p>although almost certainly professional troops</p>
<p>in the same way that the core of knights</p>
<p>around William of Normandy probably were.</p>
<p>Professional warriors, highly trained and skilled</p>
<p>and nasty fighters individually, but you know,</p>
<p>you wouldn&rsquo;t want them marching around the battlefield</p>
<p>in drill formation. That wouldn&rsquo;t work out.</p>
<p>But they provide the core, the spine of this army on the hill.</p>
<p>The rest is provided by a bunch of people</p>
<p>that range from Thanes,</p>
<p>which are sort of well-armed upper-class people,</p>
<p>but not quite as upper-class as the leadership,</p>
<p>all the way down to what are called the Ferd</p>
<p>and the Select Ferd, which, at a certain point,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re really bringing up the dregs,</p>
<p>has, like, pitchforks and that kind of thing.</p>
<p>And a lot of people, no armor, no helmets.</p>
<p>Almost everybody tries to bring a shield,</p>
<p>and they fight in a shield wall,</p>
<p>that famous formation from the era</p>
<p>where everybody sort of gets as close as they can to each other</p>
<p>and provides an almost solid object for the other side</p>
<p>to try to beat themselves to death trying to break down,</p>
<p>which is a little bit how this battle&rsquo;s going to go.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re a Battle of Hastings fan, you know that&hellip;</p>
<p>And this is going to be so different</p>
<p>than what the Normans are going to have to do</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re facing Julius Caesar and the Romans.</p>
<p>The Normans can just sort of approach the battlefield</p>
<p>and do whatever they want at their leisure.</p>
<p>They will control when encounters happen,</p>
<p>where they happen.</p>
<p>The only thing these Anglo-Saxons are going to be able to do</p>
<p>is stay in their shield wall on the hill,</p>
<p>because they only have one type of troop type.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s infantry. There&rsquo;s no cavalry.</p>
<p>There might have been some people</p>
<p>who rode to this battlefield, but they dismounted</p>
<p>and fought in the traditional infantry formation.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also no skirmishers.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s no one to go out</p>
<p>and force any action on William at all.</p>
<p>So if he wants to initiate contact</p>
<p>on the left side of the line for a while,</p>
<p>and if his left does badly, they retire down from the hill,</p>
<p>lick their wounds, have some lunch,</p>
<p>and maybe William says, okay, you know,</p>
<p>maybe after lunch we&rsquo;ll go over and attack on the right.</p>
<p>I mean, he&rsquo;s got that kind of freedom.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not going to have that against Julius Caesar.</p>
<p>In the traditional battle, though,</p>
<p>what ends up happening, and it&rsquo;s important</p>
<p>if we&rsquo;re trying to figure out whether William would win</p>
<p>or Caesar would win,</p>
<p>how the Battle of Hastings actually went,</p>
<p>because William, who probably outnumbered the Anglo-Saxons,</p>
<p>would several times attack up this hill.</p>
<p>He divides his army, by the way,</p>
<p>into a formation that was used by Normans at other times,</p>
<p>so maybe it was used in this battle that never happened,</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re going to have a scholarly analysis of,</p>
<p>a fantasy battle that we will break down logically,</p>
<p>you know, and scientifically,</p>
<p>but these Normans would bring three separate groups</p>
<p>as part of their army.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;d bring a corps of archers,</p>
<p>a corps of melee infantry, we&rsquo;ll call them,</p>
<p>and then a corps of,</p>
<p>divided into the traditional medieval three types,</p>
<p>and a corps of this heavy cavalry.</p>
<p>At Hastings, he lined them up sort of in three lines.</p>
<p>The first group were the archers.</p>
<p>At Hastings, these had self-bows,</p>
<p>which are the least powerful.</p>
<p>To the Romans, these would be non-impressive,</p>
<p>but in this period, there were not a lot of people</p>
<p>using a lot of bows,</p>
<p>so it might have been unusual and different.</p>
<p>At other battles, the Normans would use crossbows,</p>
<p>which would be much more effective.</p>
<p>Then the second group that they had</p>
<p>were all these melee infantry, so think about a,</p>
<p>we used to sort of call them your mixed medieval rabble,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s not fair,</p>
<p>but it would be whatever the person had</p>
<p>in terms of protection,</p>
<p>so it would range from nothing to leather armor</p>
<p>to various forms of metal armor.</p>
<p>Some would have helmets, some wouldn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Almost everybody would try to bring a shield.</p>
<p>The weapons would range from spears to sidearms</p>
<p>to here&rsquo;s something that I love</p>
<p>in terms of weapon continuity.</p>
<p>There were people using clubs on both sides</p>
<p>at the Battle of Hastings in 1066.</p>
<p>Is there any older weapon than clubs?</p>
<p>Maybe stones, and the Anglo-Saxons</p>
<p>were throwing stones at the Normans,</p>
<p>so what did we say earlier,</p>
<p>the shelf life of experience?</p>
<p>Well, how about the shelf life of weapons technology?</p>
<p>But what ended up happening was the archers</p>
<p>were supposed to go in there and start to break up</p>
<p>that shoulder-to-shoulder, almost solid formation</p>
<p>of the Anglo-Saxons,</p>
<p>then the melee infantry were gonna go in there</p>
<p>and batter it down even more.</p>
<p>The goal, to loosen it up.</p>
<p>And if you could disorder it,</p>
<p>disorder is the phrase we used to use in wargaming,</p>
<p>it means if the cohesion of the formation</p>
<p>begins to break up so there&rsquo;s holes in it</p>
<p>and gaps and spaces that other troops can break into,</p>
<p>especially if they&rsquo;re still in tight formation,</p>
<p>you begin to fall apart.</p>
<p>So these melee infantry were gonna go in there</p>
<p>and hopefully take advantage of any problems</p>
<p>that the archers had caused,</p>
<p>and then the next line was going to be</p>
<p>the exclamation point that won the battle.</p>
<p>So when I think of a Norman army</p>
<p>and I think of why I would wanna be careful facing one,</p>
<p>I try to figure out how I&rsquo;m gonna deal with these.</p>
<p>These are the Mike Tyson side of the army,</p>
<p>a part that you have to be worried about.</p>
<p>Even at the end of Tyson&rsquo;s career,</p>
<p>when he doesn&rsquo;t have much that you need to worry about,</p>
<p>you always need to be worried about the potential punch.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s made from these troops,</p>
<p>especially the core of Norman proto-knights</p>
<p>around William himself.</p>
<p>These guys are hard to figure,</p>
<p>and Caesar&rsquo;s gonna have trouble with them</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re hard to figure.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re sort of the wild card in this army.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re heavy cavalry, as we said.</p>
<p>So now this is the setup.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say 12,000 of these soldiers.</p>
<p>They approach the area around Hastings,</p>
<p>and their scouts come back to them,</p>
<p>probably not that far from the battlefield</p>
<p>because neither the early Middle Age Europeans</p>
<p>or the Romans, to be honest, were great at reconnaissance.</p>
<p>Both of them more surprised than you would hope for.</p>
<p>But probably William gets some feedback,</p>
<p>and the feedback is that up ahead</p>
<p>is a much larger army than we expected,</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t look like Anglo-Saxons.</p>
<p>Now, I could not decide</p>
<p>if I found it more intriguing to imagine</p>
<p>both of these sides coming together in my movie</p>
<p>with no knowledge about the other side,</p>
<p>or if it was cooler to imagine</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;d been some prep, right?</p>
<p>I mean, you have a score sheet,</p>
<p>or you have an advisor,</p>
<p>or some video on the other side,</p>
<p>or maybe a caddy, like in golf.</p>
<p>You know, and the caddy could come up to maybe Julius Caesar,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s probably being, you know, who he is.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s probably dictating five letters,</p>
<p>seducing a woman, bad-mouthing a political opponent,</p>
<p>and listening intently to everything the caddy says</p>
<p>and absorbing it.</p>
<p>This may be, by the way, the part of this battle</p>
<p>that just screws it up for everybody,</p>
<p>because if you&rsquo;ve got a genius like Caesar on one side,</p>
<p>is it really representative of anything?</p>
<p>You might be able to put Caesar on the Norman side,</p>
<p>and it becomes a rout just because, you know,</p>
<p>genius is genius.</p>
<p>But in this case, the advisor, the caddy,</p>
<p>could tell Caesar, listen,</p>
<p>these people on the other side</p>
<p>are a little bit like a better armed and armored version</p>
<p>of what you&rsquo;re already facing.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re facing barbarians. These are kind of barbarians.</p>
<p>I mean, they&rsquo;re not trained in any units.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t have a deep, organized,</p>
<p>hierarchical civilization or anything like that.</p>
<p>Their army is simplistic,</p>
<p>but they have those traits that you&rsquo;ve become accustomed</p>
<p>to seeing on the continent.</p>
<p>I mean, when you run into the Germans,</p>
<p>Caesar, they have that attitude.</p>
<p>They have that impetus. They get berserk.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a frenzy.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s that unquantifiable thing we always talk about.</p>
<p>And Caesar would be well aware of it.</p>
<p>They called it the F√ºhrer Teutonicus in Caesar&rsquo;s time,</p>
<p>but it seems to be something you ran into</p>
<p>in Western Europe, Central Europe, Northern Europe,</p>
<p>and what the heck do you define it as?</p>
<p>But whatever it was, the Normans had it, too.</p>
<p>And for what it&rsquo;s worth, the old theory used to be</p>
<p>that the Normans had it because they were Vikings, basically.</p>
<p>A couple of generations removed</p>
<p>from the old country, so to speak.</p>
<p>Those of you who like continuity</p>
<p>should note that the way William of Normandy</p>
<p>became the Duke of Normandy</p>
<p>was very similar to how the old barbarians</p>
<p>got a piece of the old Roman Empire.</p>
<p>It was sort of, let&rsquo;s call it a farming out</p>
<p>of the traditional military responsibilities,</p>
<p>or maybe you call it privatizing it.</p>
<p>But when Rome couldn&rsquo;t defend some of its territory</p>
<p>from barbarians, it used to let those barbarians</p>
<p>settle in the territory.</p>
<p>And the deal was that they could live off of it.</p>
<p>They could settle there. They could raise their families.</p>
<p>They could farm it, whatever they wanted to do.</p>
<p>But they had to protect it against the people,</p>
<p>you know, like themselves.</p>
<p>And they owed their allegiance to you, right?</p>
<p>So they were still, it was still, you know,</p>
<p>basically all yours. You had just farmed it out.</p>
<p>The Carolingians in this period,</p>
<p>right before Hastings, had done the same thing.</p>
<p>They had Viking problems during the Viking eras.</p>
<p>This area around Normandy was getting hit all the time.</p>
<p>So the best idea was maybe turn it over</p>
<p>to a bunch of Vikings, tell them to settle there,</p>
<p>Christianize them, and let them keep the other Vikings out</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll owe their allegiance to us.</p>
<p>Well, as happens sometimes with the Roman Empire,</p>
<p>these Normans, as they were called,</p>
<p>which was just another word some people used for Vikings,</p>
<p>Norseman&rsquo;s very close.</p>
<p>These guys were probably Danish, but again, not 100% certain.</p>
<p>They settled in Normandy, quickly forgot that part</p>
<p>of the deal that said, we&rsquo;re vassals of you,</p>
<p>and became a thorn in the side of the rulers of France</p>
<p>for a couple hundred years,</p>
<p>while also making their presence felt</p>
<p>in a way that defies logic,</p>
<p>punching way above their weight class</p>
<p>for reasons people have speculated upon forever.</p>
<p>I love some of the adjectives used to describe them.</p>
<p>Energy is one of the words you hear.</p>
<p>The Normans had amazing energy for 200 years,</p>
<p>but what it meant was they were fighting and rabble-rousing,</p>
<p>causing trouble, conquering places as far apart as England,</p>
<p>continental France, Italy, fighting for and against</p>
<p>the Byzantines, playing a major role in the First Crusade.</p>
<p>And eventually what ends up happening to them</p>
<p>is they get absorbed in all these societies</p>
<p>that they were involved in.</p>
<p>So, into the history of England,</p>
<p>eventually subverted into the history of continental France.</p>
<p>Their aspect will become a part of Italian history.</p>
<p>Again, for and against the Byzantines,</p>
<p>and in the Holy Land, well, as long as there was</p>
<p>a European crusading presence in the Holy Land,</p>
<p>the fume of the Normans, the stench of the Normans,</p>
<p>as maybe some of the Byzantine royalty would suggest,</p>
<p>would linger.</p>
<p>They had a lot of energy, and some people suggested</p>
<p>this was because William the Conqueror&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>I think it was great-great-great,</p>
<p>I think three greats, grandfather, was a Viking.</p>
<p>And that wonderful Viking, a berserk frenzy,</p>
<p>in a War Games research rules,</p>
<p>it was known as impetuous quality,</p>
<p>that in your rule set, nobody knew why they had it,</p>
<p>but Normans, just like Vikings, got like a special plus</p>
<p>because they had this quality.</p>
<p>Once again, what is the rule set reflecting</p>
<p>when it gives you that special plus?</p>
<p>What the heck is that?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that question of what makes a knight a knight</p>
<p>once you get beyond, you know, the weapons and armor.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something else going on.</p>
<p>What makes a samurai a samurai?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just the weapons and armor.</p>
<p>So, it&rsquo;s the part of history that&rsquo;s unquantifiable.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also the part that because it&rsquo;s unquantifiable,</p>
<p>Julius Caesar needs to worry about.</p>
<p>As he looks across, listens to what the caddy says,</p>
<p>continues to woo the woman, badmouth the political opponent,</p>
<p>and dictate five letters at the same time,</p>
<p>and sees this army from the early Middle Ages,</p>
<p>approaching him.</p>
<p>First thing he&rsquo;s gonna notice, being who he is,</p>
<p>is that it&rsquo;s small.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s used to fighting much larger armies than this.</p>
<p>And it was only three years before</p>
<p>that the Battle of the Sombra happened,</p>
<p>right across the English Channel.</p>
<p>You may recall,</p>
<p>because we did a show where this was included once,</p>
<p>that at that battle, according to Caesar himself,</p>
<p>so let&rsquo;s imagine that he doubled the enemy numbers,</p>
<p>but he said the Romans thought that they were in a safe spot.</p>
<p>Once again, never the greatest reconnaissance</p>
<p>on Rome&rsquo;s part.</p>
<p>They were all, so they had their weapons stacked,</p>
<p>their armor wasn&rsquo;t on, everybody was all scurrying around</p>
<p>like a bunch of ants, building their fort</p>
<p>and all that kind of stuff, and all of a sudden,</p>
<p>unexpectedly, 60,000 Gallic tribesmen</p>
<p>come screaming out of the woods,</p>
<p>charging the completely unprepared Romans.</p>
<p>60,000 sounds like a crazy number,</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s just say it was 30,000.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s 30,000, it&rsquo;s still like more than twice as many people</p>
<p>as William the Conqueror is going to bring</p>
<p>to our, you know, filmed battle.</p>
<p>Once more, we&rsquo;re assuming that Julius Caesar</p>
<p>is waiting for these Normans to arrive,</p>
<p>just like the Anglo-Saxons were at the Battle of the Sombra</p>
<p>three years previously, with a lot of these same troops,</p>
<p>it should be pointed out.</p>
<p>So, Caesar&rsquo;s fighting with these people</p>
<p>who remember being at that battle</p>
<p>when the supposedly 60,000,</p>
<p>but maybe closer to 30,000 tribesmen</p>
<p>come screaming out of the woods,</p>
<p>and long story short,</p>
<p>Caesar and the Romans won that battle.</p>
<p>So, that shows you the crazy superiority</p>
<p>that these supremely organized armies can have</p>
<p>over the disorganized ones.</p>
<p>And I say disorganized, I don&rsquo;t mean it intentionally,</p>
<p>because the funny thing about it is,</p>
<p>a guy like William would have thought his army was organized,</p>
<p>by his standards,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s because they didn&rsquo;t do things anymore</p>
<p>the way, for example, the Romans did,</p>
<p>not in that part of the world.</p>
<p>That is also a sign about the pace of change</p>
<p>and how earlier societies can sometimes have capabilities</p>
<p>that later societies don&rsquo;t have.</p>
<p>Now, there were contemporaries.</p>
<p>If somebody wanted to try to be the caddy for William,</p>
<p>I mean, how do you do that?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny, because it&rsquo;s easier to imagine</p>
<p>the less sophisticated army</p>
<p>than it is to imagine the more sophisticated one.</p>
<p>If you went to the commander of the USS Nimitz in 1980</p>
<p>and said in the final countdown,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re about to face Admiral Nagumo</p>
<p>and his six strike carriers from late 1941,</p>
<p>the commander of the 1980 Nimitz is going to go,</p>
<p>okay, I know what I&rsquo;m up against, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy for him to imagine</p>
<p>the less complicated technology and tactics and ships.</p>
<p>A lot harder to go to Admiral Nagumo on the other side</p>
<p>and say, Admiral, you&rsquo;re about to face the USS Nimitz</p>
<p>from 1980, it&rsquo;s a super carrier, it&rsquo;s only one carrier,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t really have any other ships with it,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;ll probably have everything in your fleet destroyed</p>
<p>before you even see it.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s like trying to explain</p>
<p>that the H.G. Wells War of the Worlds aliens are coming,</p>
<p>and let me tell you about what they&rsquo;re going to be able to do to you.</p>
<p>It might be a much longer conversation</p>
<p>before they understood, and the caddy speaking to William</p>
<p>is probably going to have the same problem.</p>
<p>How do you explain an army that&rsquo;s more sophisticated</p>
<p>than his to him?</p>
<p>Well, here&rsquo;s my movie&rsquo;s angle on that.</p>
<p>That may or may not be true, but certainly could be.</p>
<p>These Normans were famous mercenaries,</p>
<p>and they fought for and against people like the Byzantines.</p>
<p>You may recall that the Byzantines</p>
<p>did not call themselves the Byzantines.</p>
<p>They called themselves, in the time of the Normans, the Romans.</p>
<p>Because really, as many people point out,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re the part of the Roman Empire that never fell,</p>
<p>the eastern side.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re still around centuries later,</p>
<p>and they never lost the understanding</p>
<p>of how to organize troops in a professional, regular way, right?</p>
<p>Drill them the same way that cadets on the parade ground</p>
<p>at graduation at military academies all over the world still march.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how the Romans marched.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how the Byzantines marched.</p>
<p>So maybe the caddy could go up to William and say,</p>
<p>you know those Byzantines we talked about?</p>
<p>Those guys that move around the battlefield</p>
<p>in complete unison with each other.</p>
<p>At the commit, they can change facing on an order.</p>
<p>You know, remember those guys? These guys fight like that.</p>
<p>And I always love bringing up Hans Delbruck.</p>
<p>And for those of you who don&rsquo;t know Hans Delbruck,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a hard to explain guy.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s one of those historians that has managed to remain relevant</p>
<p>in some ways long after his historical information is relevant.</p>
<p>Because in all the years since Delbruck lived,</p>
<p>and he was writing more than a hundred years ago,</p>
<p>the historical knowledge has just changed so much</p>
<p>that his information is just wrong.</p>
<p>But he talks about some of that physics of the battlefield stuff,</p>
<p>the limitations of muscle power, human power,</p>
<p>animal power, logistics, all these kinds of things</p>
<p>that in a lot of ways, especially, you know,</p>
<p>up until you start getting things like vehicles on the battlefield,</p>
<p>cars and stuff, I mean, stuff that basically remain pretty constant.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s so skeptical that he&rsquo;s a wonderful piece of ballast</p>
<p>to anchor you before you read other people&rsquo;s stuff,</p>
<p>just to make you suspicious automatically.</p>
<p>But Delbruck talks about the Romans in Caesar&rsquo;s army</p>
<p>facing the Gauls, which as I said,</p>
<p>is what he&rsquo;s doing during this period historically,</p>
<p>and talks about why the Romans are going to beat the Gauls.</p>
<p>And it has to do with things like organization</p>
<p>versus ad hoc sorts of organization.</p>
<p>This would apply just as much to William&rsquo;s army</p>
<p>as it applies to the Gauls.</p>
<p>Listen to what Delbruck writes, though,</p>
<p>and understand that what the Romans are going to do</p>
<p>to this army from the early Middle Ages</p>
<p>is they&rsquo;re going to move on it.</p>
<p>Delbruck writes about the Romans and the Gauls, quote,</p>
<p>The superiority of the Roman art of warfare</p>
<p>was based on the army organization as a whole,</p>
<p>a system that permitted very large masses of men</p>
<p>to be concentrated at a given point,</p>
<p>to move in an orderly fashion,</p>
<p>to be fed and to be kept together.</p>
<p>The Gauls could do none of these things.</p>
<p>It was not so much the courage of the Romans,</p>
<p>which was in no way greater than their own,</p>
<p>but the Roman mass power that subdued them.</p>
<p>And again, not that their own mass of itself</p>
<p>would not have been much greater,</p>
<p>but their mass was an inert one, incapable of movement.</p>
<p>It was the Roman civilization that conquered barbarism,</p>
<p>for imparting the capability of movement to a large mass</p>
<p>is a work of art that only a higher civilization can achieve.</p>
<p>Barbarism cannot do it.</p>
<p>The Roman army was not simply a mass, but an organized mass.</p>
<p>And it could be a mass only because it was organized</p>
<p>and formed a complex and living entity.</p>
<p>End quote.</p>
<p>So these armies from the early Middle Ages in Europe have a problem,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s that they have the famous choice of this era,</p>
<p>which is you can stand still and keep your formation intact, right?</p>
<p>You can be the Anglo-Saxons on the hill,</p>
<p>you can have your shield wall, you can be shoulder to shoulder,</p>
<p>you can be solid.</p>
<p>But when people start to move,</p>
<p>because they move as individuals, it all falls apart.</p>
<p>Now, if that happens and the enemy gets their hands on you,</p>
<p>especially with cavalry, you are meat.</p>
<p>So your choice is we stay here and we don&rsquo;t move</p>
<p>and we don&rsquo;t fall into disorder.</p>
<p>But that allows all the impetus to go to your opponent, right?</p>
<p>You have no way of pressing them.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why the Anglo-Saxons stayed on the hill</p>
<p>and never bothered William down at the bottom of the hill.</p>
<p>The only way they could bother him is to come down.</p>
<p>If they came down, he&rsquo;d kill them.</p>
<p>The reason you know this is because that&rsquo;s what actually happened</p>
<p>in the Battle of Hastings.</p>
<p>Several times, these Saxons,</p>
<p>thinking they were pursuing retreating horsemen,</p>
<p>broke formation and ran down the hill.</p>
<p>And when they were strung out all along the hill as individuals,</p>
<p>the cavalry came back and killed them.</p>
<p>Still undetermined whether the maneuver</p>
<p>that made these Anglo-Saxons so excited</p>
<p>they thought they went won was a feigned flight,</p>
<p>a planned tactic, or whether or not, you know,</p>
<p>they had just kicked the Bretons&rsquo; butts or something like that.</p>
<p>And they were running away in disorder and just,</p>
<p>oh, look, you got your chocolate in my peanut butter</p>
<p>and all those Anglo-Saxons ran down the hill</p>
<p>so we could kill them.</p>
<p>Imagine that. Let&rsquo;s do that again.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an example of another tactic</p>
<p>that probably would not have worked against Caesar.</p>
<p>So, as William approaches this battle in my movie,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s imagine what&rsquo;s gonna happen here.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to think that several miles from the battle,</p>
<p>around the same time that William is getting word</p>
<p>about this strange army that&rsquo;s deployed</p>
<p>on a much larger piece of ground</p>
<p>than the Anglo-Saxons historically deployed upon</p>
<p>and that it&rsquo;s waiting for them,</p>
<p>I imagine you&rsquo;d start getting reports</p>
<p>that there were encounters happening,</p>
<p>probably with light infantry skirmishers.</p>
<p>Caesar&rsquo;s got, we know he&rsquo;s got slingers and light troops,</p>
<p>so people with javelins, people with maybe bows and arrows</p>
<p>and a bunch of other people, and they&rsquo;re going to engage</p>
<p>the Duke of Normandy&rsquo;s army before he gets to the battlefield.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to swarm around him like mosquitoes.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not going to do a ton of damage,</p>
<p>but they keep you from being able to leisurely</p>
<p>just deploy things at your will.</p>
<p>They are killing, you know, this guy and that guy here and there.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re wounding that guy.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s a pain in the rear,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s going to be the beginning of an encounter</p>
<p>where the Normans are not going to be given any time</p>
<p>to just sort of sit around and think what they want to do</p>
<p>and lick their wounds and then leisurely attack later.</p>
<p>Caesar and the Romans will be on them</p>
<p>before they get to the battlefield,</p>
<p>inhibiting their ability to deploy.</p>
<p>William really doesn&rsquo;t have any troops capable of doing this</p>
<p>unless we want to buy into the theory,</p>
<p>which is probable, though,</p>
<p>that the Breton cavalry he has could skirmish.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure you want to have a bunch of basically</p>
<p>proto-knightly skirmishing cavalry out there against the Romans,</p>
<p>but you can do it if you want to.</p>
<p>Remember, Caesar himself has cavalry,</p>
<p>2,000 Gallic cavalry, famously,</p>
<p>European cavalry 1.0.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m thinking, and, you know, sometimes these battles,</p>
<p>if you read the ancient accounts,</p>
<p>sometimes there&rsquo;d be these skirmishes ahead of time</p>
<p>that sort of let one side feel out the other,</p>
<p>and a lot of times it had to do with cavalry</p>
<p>because they were so mobile.</p>
<p>Maybe Caesar has his 2,000 Gallic cavalry,</p>
<p>or some of them skirmish a little bit</p>
<p>with some of these early middle-aged proto-knights</p>
<p>and sees what happens.</p>
<p>But if he does, he&rsquo;s going to see,</p>
<p>uh, I don&rsquo;t think we want to encounter them close up.</p>
<p>So maybe the Gauls skirmish,</p>
<p>which some people have suggested</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s what they fight like anyway,</p>
<p>but no one knows.</p>
<p>But if I&rsquo;m the caddy around William the Conqueror</p>
<p>giving him advice, I&rsquo;m going to tell him</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re going to feel better if you can see that cavalry,</p>
<p>because if you don&rsquo;t see the 2,000 Gallic cavalry,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got to worry about where they are.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re Julius Caesar, you might send that cavalry</p>
<p>on a wide outflanking maneuver, you know, out of view.</p>
<p>And then right when the battle reaches its crucial point,</p>
<p>they come crashing in, you know,</p>
<p>from behind you or something, turning the tide.</p>
<p>Or maybe Caesar has them make</p>
<p>an even wider outflanking movement.</p>
<p>And they go and they sack the Norman camp in the rear</p>
<p>where all their stuff is, the noncombatants are,</p>
<p>maybe the treasury is.</p>
<p>Or maybe Caesar goes even farther around the flank</p>
<p>than that, goes all the way to the coast,</p>
<p>burns the ships that William&rsquo;s going to need to get home.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t see the 2,000 Gallic cavalry,</p>
<p>you better be thinking why you don&rsquo;t see them.</p>
<p>William&rsquo;s army is divided into the three sections,</p>
<p>as we said, the Corps of Archers,</p>
<p>the Corps of Melee Infantry,</p>
<p>and then behind them, the heavy cavalry in three lines.</p>
<p>The Romans are in a traditional formation.</p>
<p>Understand that the Romans built this army</p>
<p>that happened in Caesar&rsquo;s time.</p>
<p>And this is the height of the Roman army of the legions.</p>
<p>So right from before Caesar, you know,</p>
<p>maybe his relative, Marius,</p>
<p>is the guy that you date this era from,</p>
<p>to about the mid-200s, maybe,</p>
<p>is the height of the great legionary armies.</p>
<p>In the same way that the Norman army really relies</p>
<p>on the power of this Norman proto-knightly cavalry</p>
<p>to do its business,</p>
<p>the Roman army&rsquo;s about the legionaries at this stage.</p>
<p>Some armies have lots of different things</p>
<p>they can hit you with and sting you with.</p>
<p>The Normans are about the proto-knights,</p>
<p>the Romans are about the legionaries,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s why in my movie,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to be those two elements coming together</p>
<p>that are going to decide things.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t going to be something where,</p>
<p>oh, the skirmishers decided it,</p>
<p>or the cavalry around the flank decided it.</p>
<p>In this battle, you&rsquo;re going to have</p>
<p>what you didn&rsquo;t get in the final countdown,</p>
<p>or that Twilight Zone episode.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to get to see legionaries against Normans.</p>
<p>Now, the legionaries during this period</p>
<p>represent sort of a cross-section</p>
<p>of the soon-to-be Roman Empire.</p>
<p>Remember, this is the end of the Republican.</p>
<p>In the same way that the cultures</p>
<p>of these feudal societies</p>
<p>determine how their militaries look and operate,</p>
<p>the cultures of societies like, well,</p>
<p>the late Roman Republic do, too.</p>
<p>It influences, for example, how these commanders behave.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re jockeying for political position in Rome,</p>
<p>and things like what the old newspapers are saying,</p>
<p>or the equivalent, the scuttlebutt in Rome,</p>
<p>about your conduct on the battlefield matters.</p>
<p>So, it influences your conduct on the battlefield.</p>
<p>These really, in the width and breadth</p>
<p>of the history of the Roman army,</p>
<p>this is a Roman army in transition</p>
<p>from the era where, you know,</p>
<p>how much money you had determined, you know,</p>
<p>which ranks or what type of troops</p>
<p>you were on the battlefield,</p>
<p>to one where these are, after Caesar&rsquo;s time,</p>
<p>not that long after Caesar&rsquo;s time,</p>
<p>are gonna be professional state-run forces</p>
<p>of long-serving professionals.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not quite there yet. They&rsquo;re on their way.</p>
<p>These are volunteers who are recruited,</p>
<p>but they often sort of re-up their recruitment a bunch.</p>
<p>They fight with the general for a while</p>
<p>because they become attached to them</p>
<p>in a financial and prosperity sense in some cases, too.</p>
<p>Their allegiance becomes to these generals,</p>
<p>so they stick around.</p>
<p>By the time Caesar&rsquo;s fighting in Britain in 54 BCE,</p>
<p>some of these units and troops have been fighting with him</p>
<p>for quite some time.</p>
<p>Some of them have been involved in, you know,</p>
<p>skin-of-their-teeth battles in Gaul in previous years.</p>
<p>So, this is an experienced veteran force,</p>
<p>and the Romans got very good</p>
<p>when their soldiers had been serving for a while.</p>
<p>The legionaries are all heavy infantry,</p>
<p>and heavy infantry during the pre-gunpowder era,</p>
<p>their job is to engage in hand-to-hand combat</p>
<p>with the other side.</p>
<p>So, usually to break the enemy&rsquo;s main battle line,</p>
<p>because normally you&rsquo;re fighting, you know,</p>
<p>the major portions of armies or infantry.</p>
<p>Not always, but usually.</p>
<p>The Roman legionaries have been called</p>
<p>by some of the best pre-modern heavy infantry that ever were.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know about that specifically,</p>
<p>but I think if they&rsquo;re not in your top three, you&rsquo;re insane.</p>
<p>They are all armored by this period.</p>
<p>The armor being provided by the state.</p>
<p>They are equipped with weapons provided by the state.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re run, you know, they have factories</p>
<p>that create this stuff, and the quality is high.</p>
<p>The metal quality is high, for example.</p>
<p>The standardization is high, and the standardization</p>
<p>allows the army to be trained in ways</p>
<p>that some of these tribal or early armies</p>
<p>from the Middle Ages,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t have the same kind of standardization, right?</p>
<p>You want an axe at the battle? You bring your axe.</p>
<p>You want a sword? You bring a sword.</p>
<p>You bring a sword, but it makes it tough to coordinate.</p>
<p>The Romans are all armed, the legionaries are all armed</p>
<p>the same, so their tactics can be standardized.</p>
<p>First of all, they are, at ground zero, a swordsman.</p>
<p>They have a big shield, by the way, that covers,</p>
<p>you know, about three-quarters of their body.</p>
<p>Big ol&rsquo; heavy shield, though, because you&rsquo;re not supposed</p>
<p>to be moving around dodging and weaving.</p>
<p>Your job is to run into the enemy head-on with that shield,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re gonna hit him with the shield first.</p>
<p>You got a sword that is one of the great swords in history.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve never held a good recreation of the Gladius,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s worth your time if you&rsquo;re a fan of history like I am.</p>
<p>And the sword changed over time.</p>
<p>Started as a Spanish sword,</p>
<p>did so much damage against the Romans, they adopted it,</p>
<p>and it would get longer and shorter and change its shape</p>
<p>and have various versions.</p>
<p>Julius Caesar&rsquo;s version&rsquo;s actually a little longer</p>
<p>than the one that will come in the famous empire.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about Adrian Goldsworthy puts it at, like,</p>
<p>two feet, six inches.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little longer than you might think for a Roman sword,</p>
<p>but not like the one the Normans carry, usually.</p>
<p>The Normans have a wide variety, of course,</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re not standardized.</p>
<p>The one thing you notice when you pick up a Gladius</p>
<p>of any kind is its weightedness.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a heavy sword.</p>
<p>Swords are generally lighter than most people think anyway.</p>
<p>But its weight balance is such that it feels like a cleaver.</p>
<p>You know, like you could swing it</p>
<p>at about halfway down your swinging motion.</p>
<p>The sword itself helps pick up steam.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s really the point that does the majority of the damage.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s got a point that just is meant for just puncturing</p>
<p>through things like armor.</p>
<p>And the Roman training generally insisted that they run up</p>
<p>to the enemy&rsquo;s battle line, shove the big old shield</p>
<p>in their face, and stab upward with this sword</p>
<p>into the guts of the opponent.</p>
<p>Because as the manuals pointed out,</p>
<p>a slashing cut rarely kills, but a stabbing wound,</p>
<p>even an inch into the enemy, is often fatal.</p>
<p>Weird as that may sound, right?</p>
<p>In an era before medicine, you pierce the viscera</p>
<p>and somebody&rsquo;s probably going to die.</p>
<p>Good chance of it anyway.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s qualify that remark,</p>
<p>especially if you&rsquo;re using Roman medicine.</p>
<p>The Romans, of course, had another weapon</p>
<p>for which they were famous, the pylum.</p>
<p>The pylum is a heavy, heavy javelin.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve ever held it, it&rsquo;s another interesting weapon</p>
<p>and you look at it and you just kind of go,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s sort of ingenious.</p>
<p>A variation like most of the Roman weapons</p>
<p>of something they encountered once upon a time</p>
<p>and then decided they could make a better version themselves</p>
<p>and then standardize it.</p>
<p>Basically, and Adrian Goldsworthy says,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a myth that they were deliberately built</p>
<p>to be flimsy at one point so that it would bend.</p>
<p>Because we all grew up thinking that, you know,</p>
<p>these had a long tip and then when they were thrown,</p>
<p>the weight of the handle would bend the pylum downwards.</p>
<p>So if it was sticking in your body or your shield</p>
<p>or whatever, you had this thing that was impeding you.</p>
<p>Goldsworthy says that&rsquo;s a myth,</p>
<p>which sort of implies that it was just bad craftsmanship.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, these heavy javelins</p>
<p>are a whole different animal than the lighter ones</p>
<p>you throw to distance,</p>
<p>although the Romans had those too.</p>
<p>But these things were much more like</p>
<p>the Duke of Normandy&rsquo;s muskets,</p>
<p>where in your head you may be thinking</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re shooting real far away, you know, at things,</p>
<p>but they weren&rsquo;t in the Napoleonic era</p>
<p>because they weren&rsquo;t that accurate.</p>
<p>You had to fire a lot of them at short range</p>
<p>and then they started mowing people down.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s the same principle sort of with the heavy javelin.</p>
<p>The heavy throwing weapon is what the war games</p>
<p>research rules used to classify it as.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s in line with the equivalents</p>
<p>were like Frankish throwing axes.</p>
<p>I mean, heavy throwing weapons were nasty</p>
<p>because they mess up your unit, right?</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re thrown in volley.</p>
<p>So imagine you and a bunch of your friends get together,</p>
<p>line up in shield wall formation</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s a good one for people, you know,</p>
<p>that haven&rsquo;t trained together.</p>
<p>You think, oh, let&rsquo;s just get together,</p>
<p>form a solid body, we&rsquo;ll overlap shields.</p>
<p>You can kind of work that and improvise that,</p>
<p>and it works okay if you don&rsquo;t try to move.</p>
<p>So you imagine you&rsquo;re in that formation</p>
<p>and these Romans come up</p>
<p>and they fought during this time period in cohorts.</p>
<p>A cohort is about 480 men on paper.</p>
<p>But if we&rsquo;re going to be historical</p>
<p>about our fantasy battle here,</p>
<p>and you know I like to be rigorous</p>
<p>in my logical breakdown of fantasy battles,</p>
<p>then I think you&rsquo;ve got to say</p>
<p>that these are probably understrength units by now.</p>
<p>I mean, after all,</p>
<p>Caesar&rsquo;s been fighting in France, right?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s been nasty, so I think,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s just cut our 480 paper strength down to 350.</p>
<p>And now you have to imagine that these people are in blocks.</p>
<p>If you could view it from the Goodyear blimp looking down,</p>
<p>the Roman cohorts, that&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re called,</p>
<p>of 480 men on paper,</p>
<p>are like little rectangular blocks on the battlefield.</p>
<p>Their normal tactic is, especially against infantry,</p>
<p>that when they&rsquo;re about 15 yards or something,</p>
<p>this could vary,</p>
<p>they unleash a volley of these heavy javelins.</p>
<p>So imagine, in this case, 350 of them at an opponent,</p>
<p>and then they take advantage of the disorder created by that.</p>
<p>I mean, if you and your buddies</p>
<p>are in your shield wall formation</p>
<p>and 350 heavy javelins come at you all in one volley,</p>
<p>how long does it take you to open up your eyes again</p>
<p>and be ready and gird down again and get ready for something?</p>
<p>How long? What&rsquo;s the time period?</p>
<p>Because the Romans are then going to charge</p>
<p>right on top of the volley of heavy javelins</p>
<p>and try to take advantage of what that volley did to you</p>
<p>with these swords as a cutting machine.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how they did it.</p>
<p>So in this battle, this fantasy battle,</p>
<p>as it begins, I&rsquo;m going to think that William moves.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to say he moves because if he doesn&rsquo;t move,</p>
<p>Julius Caesar will kill him one of two ways.</p>
<p>Either he will just, if the Romans sit there,</p>
<p>they will be building stuff.</p>
<p>And he will have, like, fortifications built</p>
<p>if William sits around for too long.</p>
<p>You wait three days, it&rsquo;s going to be like, you know,</p>
<p>World War I in the early Middle Ages.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t think William&rsquo;s going to sit there</p>
<p>and let the Romans do that.</p>
<p>I also truly don&rsquo;t think Caesar would even bother.</p>
<p>I think if the enemy showed up there,</p>
<p>Caesar&rsquo;s going to force them to do something.</p>
<p>And I think those skirmishers will be the reason</p>
<p>that it happens.</p>
<p>Go look at a video online of rioters.</p>
<p>And by the way, I think that that,</p>
<p>and I could be wrong about this.</p>
<p>This is just my own belief.</p>
<p>But when I look at these videos of really big riots,</p>
<p>the ones where the authorities come out in shields</p>
<p>that might be like Roman shields and they get in formation,</p>
<p>I think that looks very much like</p>
<p>what a pre-modern formation might.</p>
<p>And when you see them up against sometimes these crowds</p>
<p>that are sort of chaotic and moving like a swarm of bees</p>
<p>and they come forward and backwards,</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s both what skirmishing</p>
<p>and what a lot of earlier battles must have looked like</p>
<p>when we talk about the physics of warfare.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re getting a pretty good idea</p>
<p>when you look at those videos.</p>
<p>Finally, some of them have horsemen</p>
<p>that charge into the mass.</p>
<p>The authorities bring in cavalry</p>
<p>and they charge into the mass of the protesters.</p>
<p>And again, I think you&rsquo;re seeing, you know,</p>
<p>elements of muscle power and range</p>
<p>and how horses interact with people</p>
<p>that might give us a clue better than some of the other sources</p>
<p>in terms of things we can visualize,</p>
<p>especially better than movies and TV and that kind of thing,</p>
<p>about what the physics of warfare might be like.</p>
<p>And I think if Caesar&rsquo;s got a couple thousand,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s just say 5,000 skirmishers in front of William&rsquo;s troops</p>
<p>as they try to sit there,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going to be pretty badly stung</p>
<p>by the time this battle even starts.</p>
<p>I especially think his archers are going to have had trouble</p>
<p>because shooting at these skirmishers</p>
<p>is going to prove fruitless.</p>
<p>I mean, they only have so many arrows.</p>
<p>Do they really want to waste them on a bunch of unarmored guys</p>
<p>dodging and running and moving around</p>
<p>and trying to not get hit by their arrows?</p>
<p>Or do they want to save them for, you know,</p>
<p>the troops that they really have to use them against?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to suggest that they save them,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m going to think that when that happens,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going to lose a lot of people in the process</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re not going to be able to keep the skirmishers off you.</p>
<p>When these archers approach Caesar&rsquo;s ranks</p>
<p>and unleash their arrows,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think the arrows are going to do anything.</p>
<p>The Romans have formations</p>
<p>where they can create their shield wall of their own,</p>
<p>but the Romans famously have a roof to their shield wall.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called the testudo, the tortoise formation.</p>
<p>If Caesar wants to, he can just have his troops on a command</p>
<p>create this formation where they look like a box of shields.</p>
<p>These little self-bows that the Anglo-Saxon era</p>
<p>Norman infantry are using</p>
<p>are probably as weak as anything the Romans have faced.</p>
<p>I mean, remember, the Romans have faced bows from the east</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re fantastically powerful composite bows.</p>
<p>These would not damage the Romans.</p>
<p>And so, I see the archers, you know, shooting all their arrows,</p>
<p>running out, not having much to work with.</p>
<p>So, they do what they did historically</p>
<p>at the Battle of Hastings, and after shooting their arrows,</p>
<p>retiring behind the melee infantry.</p>
<p>You know, this group of mixed early Middle Ages infantry</p>
<p>that then move up and try to deal with the Roman legionaries.</p>
<p>Now, this is where we can have some fun.</p>
<p>Do they move up and try to deal with the Roman legionaries?</p>
<p>Because if they move,</p>
<p>their formation&rsquo;s probably going to be disordered.</p>
<p>Do they really want to be disordered</p>
<p>against these formations in front of them</p>
<p>that looked like blocks of marching men in unison?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Maybe it depends on, you know,</p>
<p>what the people in charge of that unit,</p>
<p>the historical commanders, running things want to do.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>But if they want to maintain their formation,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going to have to stay in place.</p>
<p>If they stay in place,</p>
<p>these legionaries are going to move around them.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re going to outflank them</p>
<p>so that they&rsquo;re going to be surrounded,</p>
<p>at least on one side, maybe on both sides.</p>
<p>So, you see the problem that these untrained troops</p>
<p>in these units have.</p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t move,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re fighting people who can.</p>
<p>So, either you have, at some point,</p>
<p>a bunch of disordered melee infantry</p>
<p>running into the legionaries</p>
<p>and running into that storm of heavy javelins</p>
<p>followed by the swords,</p>
<p>disordered and out of formation and without cohesion,</p>
<p>in which case they&rsquo;ll get killed,</p>
<p>or you see them maintaining their cohesion</p>
<p>but getting outflanked, in which case they&rsquo;ll get killed.</p>
<p>So, I don&rsquo;t see the infantry from this period</p>
<p>causing the Romans any trouble.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll be just as easy,</p>
<p>and there are probably less of them,</p>
<p>than what Caesar&rsquo;s been dealing with on the continent</p>
<p>in Gaul, historically.</p>
<p>The problem, of course, and the crux,</p>
<p>you know, the money scene in this film</p>
<p>is going to be how Caesar deals with the unquantifiable,</p>
<p>you know, Norman, Mike Tyson punch that can lay you low.</p>
<p>At the Battle of Hastings,</p>
<p>after the melee infantry retired,</p>
<p>not having been able, by the way,</p>
<p>to break the Anglo-Saxons on the hill,</p>
<p>it was the turn of the heavy cavalry.</p>
<p>I would see the same thing,</p>
<p>the heavy cavalry coming and trying to deal,</p>
<p>maybe, with one of these cohorts</p>
<p>that seemed a little exposed,</p>
<p>maybe the last one on the front lines.</p>
<p>And they were set up often in a checkerboard formation,</p>
<p>so that you would have one covering another,</p>
<p>and they had a reserve.</p>
<p>So, unlike most of these armies from the early Middle Ages,</p>
<p>who didn&rsquo;t have a reserve,</p>
<p>there were people behind the front of the Roman line,</p>
<p>in case somebody broke through,</p>
<p>or in case somebody surrounded you,</p>
<p>you have to create a new front.</p>
<p>You take someone from the rear and a cohort from there,</p>
<p>and you make them the new front line on the edge, on the flank.</p>
<p>So, maybe the Normans see the best place to strike</p>
<p>at the front, in my movie, of the line, at the edge.</p>
<p>And they come barreling in,</p>
<p>and I have to try to figure out now</p>
<p>how I want to interpret, you know,</p>
<p>the physics of ancient warfare.</p>
<p>The best account I ever heard</p>
<p>of the questions involved that experts have,</p>
<p>you would think we would understand this, right?</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s crazy to think we don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>was the one that historian David Nicole gave</p>
<p>in the Osprey book on the Normans.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a rather introductory book,</p>
<p>but I had never seen anybody do such a great rundown</p>
<p>of the major questions involved.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s doing it in terms of discussing</p>
<p>the Normans specifically,</p>
<p>but it applies to all pre-modern battles.</p>
<p>You just don&rsquo;t know how they fought.</p>
<p>The very common questions about what happens</p>
<p>when two groups of people, blocks of men,</p>
<p>run into each other.</p>
<p>We wish we knew any of these things.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s why when people say,</p>
<p>Dan, what would you do with a time machine?</p>
<p>I always say, I want to be in a hot air balloon</p>
<p>a hundred yards above one of these ancient battles,</p>
<p>just so I can see how the whole thing works.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what historian David Nicole</p>
<p>sort of sums up some of the major questions here.</p>
<p>And when you hear it, you kind of go,</p>
<p>wow, yeah, that is a lot of stuff</p>
<p>to not really understand how it worked.</p>
<p>And by the way, several of these words,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to cut up the narrative with it,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re in quotes because, for example,</p>
<p>a word like cavalry shock tactics,</p>
<p>which is something you&rsquo;ll hear people use,</p>
<p>is an implicit belief right there</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s what cavalry did.</p>
<p>So some of these words are in quotation marks.</p>
<p>And he writes, quote,</p>
<p>only recently have historians used psychological techniques</p>
<p>developed during and after the Second World War</p>
<p>to probe the probable stresses</p>
<p>faced by men and animals in pre-industrial warfare.</p>
<p>What, for example,</p>
<p>was the reality of medieval cavalry shock tactics</p>
<p>against disciplined or at least determined infantry?</p>
<p>Were infantry more afraid of horses</p>
<p>or of the men riding them?</p>
<p>Did cavalry fear archers more or less</p>
<p>than they feared other cavalry?</p>
<p>What happened when charging cavalry</p>
<p>met disciplined infantry in ranks?</p>
<p>And at what speed did they come into contact?</p>
<p>What effect did the impact have on any second rank of cavalry</p>
<p>or on the further ranks of infantry?</p>
<p>What happened when two forces of cavalry on the move</p>
<p>met head-on?</p>
<p>And how closely packed were such units when they collided?</p>
<p>How, in fact, did cavalry pass through other cavalry</p>
<p>or ride down infantry?</p>
<p>Clearly, he writes, the results of combat</p>
<p>were intended to be more predictable</p>
<p>than the results of a suicidal accident.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, he says, medieval illustrations of battle</p>
<p>often portray what looks like the split second prior</p>
<p>to a violent encounter rather than realistic combat.</p>
<p>End quote.</p>
<p>So does this heavy cavalry charge</p>
<p>into the Roman legionaries</p>
<p>like driving a car into a crowd of people?</p>
<p>Or is that more of a, you know, one of those tragic accidents</p>
<p>Nicole was talking about?</p>
<p>Maybe they come up and they throw their spears</p>
<p>the way it shows in the Bayeux Tapestry,</p>
<p>and they wait to see if that has any effect.</p>
<p>And if it breaks the formation a little bit,</p>
<p>then they can, you know, charge in there with swords</p>
<p>and stuff like that.</p>
<p>They may ride along the front of the infantry</p>
<p>and just spear them as they go by</p>
<p>in sort of a spear-fishing fashion.</p>
<p>Or Nicole suggests or theorizes that it&rsquo;s possible</p>
<p>that the horses of the Normans were trained to push,</p>
<p>as it&rsquo;s called, and that the Normans would go up</p>
<p>and with their spear tip, essentially touch the spear tip</p>
<p>onto the enemy&rsquo;s shield, or human body,</p>
<p>and sort of jostle it.</p>
<p>And if you have 40, 50, 60 guys against the front lines</p>
<p>doing this jostling at the same time,</p>
<p>well, he says, was the Anglo-Saxon formation</p>
<p>at Hastings jostled to death?</p>
<p>Maybe he said jostled to defeat,</p>
<p>but he was just sort of theorizing there,</p>
<p>and who doesn&rsquo;t love that?</p>
<p>I know I do.</p>
<p>As I&rsquo;m theorizing about this situation,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t help but think that whether or not the Norman</p>
<p>or the other heavy cavalry here</p>
<p>are gonna crash into the Roman ranks,</p>
<p>whether or not they&rsquo;re gonna ride along the front</p>
<p>like they&rsquo;re spear-fishing for legionaries,</p>
<p>or whether or not they&rsquo;re gonna do something like</p>
<p>throw these lances and wait for some effect to happen</p>
<p>so they can charge in with swords,</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;re gonna have to deal with one immediate thing</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to be sort of the judgment moment here,</p>
<p>is how do they handle when at some point</p>
<p>they come too close or decide to charge in</p>
<p>to the legionaries, and they get, what did we say,</p>
<p>an understrength cohort.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ll say 350 of these heavy javelins</p>
<p>thrown simultaneously in a volley,</p>
<p>tossed at their face.</p>
<p>Forget about the men, by the way.</p>
<p>Think about what that does to the horses.</p>
<p>The horses of the European cavalry at this period</p>
<p>are not armored.</p>
<p>The men are, but the horses aren&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Even if they were, I&rsquo;m not sure it makes a ton of difference.</p>
<p>That is a storm of steel, ancient style.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t it sound like you&rsquo;d have this awful train wreck,</p>
<p>15 yards, 10 yards in front of the Roman front lines</p>
<p>as everybody fell on top of everybody</p>
<p>and then the rear ranks fell over them?</p>
<p>And then, when that mess is screaming and writhing,</p>
<p>one second after the collapse,</p>
<p>then the 350 to 480 Romans in that cohort</p>
<p>charge with their swords?</p>
<p>Ugh.</p>
<p>So, I&rsquo;m thinking 90% chance that&rsquo;s how it goes.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the problem.</p>
<p>The Normans, like Tyson late in his career,</p>
<p>still have a puncher&rsquo;s chance.</p>
<p>The possibility exists that with whatever it is,</p>
<p>that unquantifiable thing that always gets them a plus</p>
<p>in the war games rules I grew up playing,</p>
<p>based on contemporary accounts</p>
<p>and people&rsquo;s attitudes at the time,</p>
<p>of all the biases they were and whatnot.</p>
<p>Even the Byzantines, who couldn&rsquo;t stand the Normans,</p>
<p>called their charge irresistible.</p>
<p>So, how do you model that in your war games rules?</p>
<p>So, maybe it&rsquo;s irresistible to the legionaries, too.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t become a person on the world stage</p>
<p>the way the Normans were people on the world stage</p>
<p>for a couple of hundred years</p>
<p>without having something special.</p>
<p>Who the hell knows what that is,</p>
<p>but it was a battlefield quality.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m suggesting that like the Seleucids</p>
<p>at the Battle of Magnesia,</p>
<p>the Roman cohort that first gets hit by these cavalry breaks.</p>
<p>The Romans, by the way, the legionaries had famously,</p>
<p>throughout their history, faced heavy cavalry,</p>
<p>really heavy cavalry on multiple occasions,</p>
<p>and multiple different kinds of heavy cavalry.</p>
<p>They faced, as I just said, the Seleucids,</p>
<p>who were like Alexander the Great&rsquo;s successors,</p>
<p>and they were fully armored men on fully armored horses.</p>
<p>Those are called cataphracts, by the way,</p>
<p>and the Romans would develop their own cataphracts</p>
<p>to imitate them.</p>
<p>The Romans faced the Parthians and the Sassanids,</p>
<p>both of whom used cataphracts.</p>
<p>They faced the Sarmatians, a steppe people,</p>
<p>like the Scythians and the Huns and those kinds of people,</p>
<p>who also rode fully armored horses</p>
<p>and had fully armored men and used the contus,</p>
<p>a big long lance.</p>
<p>And the legionaries never liked facing them,</p>
<p>but did pretty well.</p>
<p>They did break the left flank,</p>
<p>supposedly, of the Romans at Magnesia,</p>
<p>and the cataphracts tried to raid the Roman camp,</p>
<p>and the Roman camp, being like a castle almost,</p>
<p>gave them too much trouble.</p>
<p>In other words, despite the occasional problems</p>
<p>that the Romans had with this cavalry,</p>
<p>by and large, they dealt with it.</p>
<p>And I think they would have dealt with the Norman knights too,</p>
<p>even if that first cohort ran,</p>
<p>because as I said, the Romans are going to have a reserve.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s gonna be another cohort</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to move up and move on</p>
<p>the Normans as they&rsquo;re pursuing this other unit.</p>
<p>So imagine what this looks like on film.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve splattered into this one legion.</p>
<p>The 480 or so men are now running.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s devolved into a million little battles.</p>
<p>One Norman on two fleeing Romans, you know.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s stretched out over a long space,</p>
<p>and then a unit of formed men marching in formation</p>
<p>like a block marches right up to that,</p>
<p>and then just tears it up.</p>
<p>And the Mike Tyson super punch</p>
<p>that you have to worry about was outboxed.</p>
<p>There are other things Caesar could have done, by the way,</p>
<p>if you think about the way the Byzantines</p>
<p>used to handle the Normans.</p>
<p>They fought the Normans for real, didn&rsquo;t like it,</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t like facing any of the Western European cavalry,</p>
<p>but they had all sorts of ways to beat them.</p>
<p>Most of them involved around boxing them,</p>
<p>not fighting them, starving them.</p>
<p>They said they had all these wonderful qualities</p>
<p>that made them like Vikings.</p>
<p>And at the same time, they were like children</p>
<p>in other respects, tactically unsophisticated,</p>
<p>not willing to put up with much hardship.</p>
<p>I mean, I think the strategic on specifically says</p>
<p>that if they run out of wine, the army will go home.</p>
<p>And so the Byzantines often just sort of refused</p>
<p>to actually settle down and fight them,</p>
<p>and they would often just go home.</p>
<p>But when they did fight them,</p>
<p>they also had all these little stratagems on the battlefield.</p>
<p>One of them was caltrops.</p>
<p>A good way to think of caltrops is like tacks</p>
<p>that somebody would throw on the floor in front of a doorway</p>
<p>so that when someone walked in the doorway,</p>
<p>all of a sudden they&rsquo;re bare feet,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve got tacks everywhere.</p>
<p>These are like tacks for horses,</p>
<p>and oftentimes the Byzantines would set up a whole zone</p>
<p>of these things in front of their infantry formations.</p>
<p>So think about like a 50-yard by 50-yard square,</p>
<p>you know, 10 yards in front of the front lines</p>
<p>when the Normans or the Frankish cavalry</p>
<p>or whatever it is charge, they hit those tacks.</p>
<p>And the same thing happens to the cavalry</p>
<p>that we imagined happening when 350 heavy javelins hit it, right?</p>
<p>They fall apart into a car crash,</p>
<p>and you can either counter charge them</p>
<p>or in the case of the Byzantines,</p>
<p>probably just shoot them down from there.</p>
<p>We also should remember that it&rsquo;s at this point</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s very possible in my movie</p>
<p>that the 2,000 Gallic cavalry, the European cavalry 1.0</p>
<p>that would never want to face these Norman proto-knights</p>
<p>head-on arrive to face them</p>
<p>when the Normans are least capable of resisting,</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re routing, when they&rsquo;re running away,</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re trying to escape, when they&rsquo;re in ones and twos,</p>
<p>and all of a sudden, the 2,000 cavalry just sweep down</p>
<p>on the battlefield, spearing down everything.</p>
<p>If they haven&rsquo;t already burned the Norman camp</p>
<p>or the ships to have them go home,</p>
<p>unlike the real Battle of Hastings,</p>
<p>which took all day, 9 a.m. to sundown,</p>
<p>and which the Normans almost lost</p>
<p>on a couple of occasions during the day,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think this would take too long.</p>
<p>And unlike that battle, had the Normans lost,</p>
<p>I think a lot of them would have gotten away</p>
<p>because those infantrymen would not have been very good pursuers.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think many of these Normans get away this time.</p>
<p>I think the Gallic cavalry and all the light troops</p>
<p>meet the Normans on the beach trying to get away,</p>
<p>and you have an ancient version of the Dunkirk battle</p>
<p>from 1940 in the Second World War.</p>
<p>But this time, the side trying to get away</p>
<p>by the skin of its teeth doesn&rsquo;t make it.</p>
<p>I think Julius Caesar in my movie</p>
<p>walks up to William the Conqueror</p>
<p>and offers him a drink in his tent before he has him executed.</p>
<p>Then again, maybe he wouldn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Caesar was known for his clemency, after all,</p>
<p>especially if his clemency would get him something.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I prefer to think about him</p>
<p>treating William the Conqueror the way he treated somebody</p>
<p>like the Gallic leader Vercingetorix.</p>
<p>Put him on ice for a while, save him for the party.</p>
<p>And then when we eventually have the triumph</p>
<p>for this whole region, not just this one little area,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll bring him on display with the other malcontents,</p>
<p>march him down one of the main streets in Rome</p>
<p>so everybody can jeer at him</p>
<p>and give me credit for defeating him,</p>
<p>and then we&rsquo;ll have him ritually strangled</p>
<p>with the rest of them.</p>
<p>William the Conqueror ritually strangled by Julius Caesar.</p>
<p>It has a ring to it, doesn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>Especially if you&rsquo;re Roman.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s not be too trusting of the pre-fight analysts,</p>
<p>the pundits, the prognosticators who suggest</p>
<p>that this Roman victory over the Normans</p>
<p>is a foregone conclusion because, you know,</p>
<p>sometimes the puncher wins.</p>
<p>The closest analogy maybe you can find</p>
<p>for an actual battle between Normans and Romans</p>
<p>is when the Normans fought the people</p>
<p>who still called themselves Romans, the Byzantines.</p>
<p>How about the Battle of Dyrrhachium in 1081?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one of those battles</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s an interesting, ironic twist</p>
<p>that all you fans, true fans,</p>
<p>of the Battle of Hastings already know about.</p>
<p>In this case, you have an army.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just politely say it is far off the highs</p>
<p>of Byzantine strength and power,</p>
<p>and the Byzantine state in this period</p>
<p>and the Norman state in this period put together</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t equal a tiny percentage</p>
<p>of Julius Caesar&rsquo;s late republic power,</p>
<p>but it makes them a better match against each other,</p>
<p>and they met at the Battle of Dyrrhachium</p>
<p>in modern-day Albania.</p>
<p>Amongst the Byzantine army is a famous unit</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s been around for a long time by this time period.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re called the Varangian Guard.</p>
<p>Varangian&rsquo;s another word usually used in the East for Vikings.</p>
<p>Viking is more of an avocation than an ethnic term,</p>
<p>we should point out.</p>
<p>But the Varangian Guard used to be composed</p>
<p>of all those Swedes and people like that</p>
<p>who fought with battle axes</p>
<p>and looked a lot like Vikings to us.</p>
<p>By this time period, they&rsquo;re using what&rsquo;s left</p>
<p>of those kinds of people.</p>
<p>I love the way from a hundred years ago,</p>
<p>a historian like Sir Charles Oman probably would have put it,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m putting words into his mouth,</p>
<p>but he was one of those guys</p>
<p>that would have been very comfortable saying</p>
<p>that the Middle Ages began at the fields of Hastings</p>
<p>when the Viking system of warfare,</p>
<p>of infantry using battle axes and going into shield walls</p>
<p>was decisively defeated by, you know,</p>
<p>the mounted knights now of Europe</p>
<p>who will rule the roost for several hundred years.</p>
<p>Something like the Battle of Dyrrachium in 1081</p>
<p>would be something like, you know,</p>
<p>the final appeal of the Viking Age being denied</p>
<p>when the results of Hastings are confirmed.</p>
<p>A guy like Oman might say,</p>
<p>because what happened at the Battle of Dyrrachium</p>
<p>is the Byzantines were using mercenaries and auxiliaries</p>
<p>just as the Romans had.</p>
<p>In this case, some of them were refugees</p>
<p>from the Battle of Hastings.</p>
<p>Much of the Varangian guard in 1081 were Anglo-Saxons.</p>
<p>And the ironic twist from the Battle of Hastings</p>
<p>is not only are there Anglo-Saxons</p>
<p>who fought at the Battle of Hastings</p>
<p>at the Battle of Dyrrachium,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re once again fighting Normans.</p>
<p>In fact, Normans where it&rsquo;s very likely</p>
<p>there were some people who fought</p>
<p>at the Battle of Hastings too.</p>
<p>This is like getting a second crack.</p>
<p>You know, Frasier Ali one, this is Frasier Ali two.</p>
<p>And just like the first fight though,</p>
<p>the Anglo-Saxons in the Varangian guard,</p>
<p>if you believe the sources,</p>
<p>pursuing what they thought was a defeated foe once again,</p>
<p>just like at Hastings, blows themselves out</p>
<p>like a bunch of horses who&rsquo;ve run too far and too fast,</p>
<p>loses their cohesion</p>
<p>and gets their rear end handed to them again.</p>
<p>Famously, they&rsquo;re supposed to have tried</p>
<p>to take refuge in a nearby church,</p>
<p>which the Normans proceed to burn down, killing them all.</p>
<p>Welcome to Norman history, by the way.</p>
<p>The ironic part about it is they were supposed</p>
<p>to be pursuing a beaten foe</p>
<p>because the Byzantines had managed to blow away</p>
<p>a whole flank of Normans and Norman knights.</p>
<p>So this should have been the beginning of the end.</p>
<p>They should have been able to wrap around them</p>
<p>in a half moon sort of fashion</p>
<p>and just begin to roll up the enemy army.</p>
<p>But what saved them is the proverbial big punch</p>
<p>when the Norman knights charge again,</p>
<p>supposedly at a joint in the line.</p>
<p>So if you think about the Byzantine frontline</p>
<p>having a left wing and a right wing and a center,</p>
<p>there are joints or hinges between a wing and the center.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re supposed to have charged at one of those wings.</p>
<p>Maybe, again, physics of battle thing,</p>
<p>in small groups that just continually scared the hell</p>
<p>out of the people they were running into.</p>
<p>Remember, the Byzantines considered</p>
<p>the Norman charge irresistible.</p>
<p>And the funny part about that is just like a boxing match</p>
<p>where psychology comes into play.</p>
<p>And they used to say, if you were going to face a Tyson</p>
<p>or a George Foreman or a Sonny Liston,</p>
<p>that you could be so intimidated that you were beaten</p>
<p>before you even crawled into the ring.</p>
<p>If you read or hear, or there&rsquo;s a reputation</p>
<p>going around the scuttlebutt here in the military barracks,</p>
<p>that the Norman charge is irresistible,</p>
<p>and all of a sudden you see them coming at you,</p>
<p>how much of that becomes a foregone</p>
<p>psychological conclusion?</p>
<p>And remember, when you&rsquo;re talking about group psychology</p>
<p>as opposed to somebody who maybe can toughen it out</p>
<p>in the ring, you&rsquo;re only as strong as your weakest link.</p>
<p>How many people in your formed formation</p>
<p>lined up like bowling pins have to decide that,</p>
<p>listen, the first people who run away here</p>
<p>are going to be the people who survive?</p>
<p>How many of them have to decide that they&rsquo;re going to flee</p>
<p>before the whole formation melts?</p>
<p>I had a gun pointed at me once.</p>
<p>I always wondered how I&rsquo;d behave.</p>
<p>And it was a ridiculous situation</p>
<p>because the police officers just ran at me.</p>
<p>I was in a crowd of other people and just said</p>
<p>that we had to run away.</p>
<p>But the gun was blocks away.</p>
<p>I mean, there was really no danger at all.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ve never forgotten the sense of contagious panic</p>
<p>that took over instantly.</p>
<p>I always wondered how I&rsquo;d behave,</p>
<p>but I always assumed I&rsquo;d have some time to think about it.</p>
<p>Instead, it just takes over.</p>
<p>Remember, the Greek god of panic is the ruler of battlefields,</p>
<p>and it doesn&rsquo;t take a whole lot to spark a collapse.</p>
<p>And it looks like at the Battle of Dyrrachium,</p>
<p>the Norman charge at the hinge in the Byzantine line,</p>
<p>again, if that&rsquo;s correct and you believe it,</p>
<p>is supposed to have caused the entire center</p>
<p>to just sort of collapse.</p>
<p>So before we look at the paper and decide</p>
<p>that these legionaries will automatically, obviously,</p>
<p>beat the Normans, let&rsquo;s account for the fact</p>
<p>that sometimes, you know, the same reason</p>
<p>my war games research rules gives that&rsquo;s plus one</p>
<p>to Normans, Vikings, ancient Germans,</p>
<p>and early Celtic people, or whatever it is,</p>
<p>you never know what they might, you know,</p>
<p>what sort of rabbit the Normans might pull out of a hat.</p>
<p>And I guess when we try to look at this in terms of my movie,</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s the kind of thing that&rsquo;s going to have</p>
<p>to be included in the director&rsquo;s cut.</p>
<p>And of course, you know, me being a capitalist,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;ll be an extra charge for that.</p>
<p>If you think the show you just heard is worth a dollar,</p>
<p>Dan and Ben would love to have it.</p>
<p>Go to dancarland.com for information</p>
<p>on how to donate to the show.</p>
<p>For the latest news, information, and thoughts from Dan,</p>
<p>make sure to follow his history feed on Twitter.</p>
<p>The address is at Hardcore History.</p>
<p>So, I just heard the audio that you just heard.</p>
<p>And my first reaction afterwards was,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll see, that&rsquo;s why we have a Hardcore History addendum feed.</p>
<p>You would not want a narrowly targeted show like that</p>
<p>on a more broadly based program</p>
<p>like the big Hardcore History one, right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m hoping, as I said, that in five years,</p>
<p>when you look at the archives, it&rsquo;s a bunch of stuff</p>
<p>maybe you don&rsquo;t care about, but hopefully a few of them</p>
<p>are really hitting your sweet spot.</p>
<p>I mean, if you&rsquo;re a pre-industrial military history,</p>
<p>alternative history fan,</p>
<p>this show probably just totally tickled your fancy, right?</p>
<p>Would have tickled mine.</p>
<p>So, I hope you enjoyed it.</p>
<p>Those of you who stuck around,</p>
<p>I do have a few announcements to make.</p>
<p>The cynical amongst you may consider them</p>
<p>nothing more than a cheap excuse</p>
<p>for why the next big Hardcore History show</p>
<p>is going to be late.</p>
<p>I would argue with that because I don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a cheap excuse, I think it&rsquo;s a good excuse.</p>
<p>Those of you who are familiar</p>
<p>with the old Ed Sullivan Show act,</p>
<p>with the guy who used to spin plates,</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;d have like five or six spinning plates</p>
<p>on these canes or sticks or rods or whatever they were.</p>
<p>And of course, you know, the plates will start spinning</p>
<p>at some point, and, well, I had all these plates</p>
<p>successfully spinning for a while,</p>
<p>and then they all started wobbling at once.</p>
<p>And well, the next Hardcore History&rsquo;s big show,</p>
<p>Supernova in the East, will be a little late,</p>
<p>I guess is what I&rsquo;m saying.</p>
<p>But I have a good reason why,</p>
<p>and I think you might like this stuff.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s multiple things, right?</p>
<p>Like I said, multiple spinning plates.</p>
<p>The first one was, I was fortunate enough</p>
<p>to be involved in the Jordan Peele reboot</p>
<p>of the Twilight Zone series.</p>
<p>And you know what a Twilight Zone fan I am.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of this show that&rsquo;s got some basis in that,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure, genetically or, you know,</p>
<p>early developmentally speaking.</p>
<p>It was a remake of the famous William Shatner</p>
<p>in the plane with the gremlin on the wing episode.</p>
<p>And it was revamped so that there&rsquo;s a podcast involved,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll never guess who they chose</p>
<p>to be the voice in the podcast.</p>
<p>And not only did I get to be in this remake</p>
<p>of a show that, you know, I think it was formative,</p>
<p>important to my formative development,</p>
<p>I got to be Rodman Edwards was the name,</p>
<p>was the host of the podcast.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s Rod Serling&rsquo;s name, Rodman Edward Serling.</p>
<p>So that was really cool.</p>
<p>One of those opportunities that you just have to say</p>
<p>to yourself, well, I don&rsquo;t care if this takes some time,</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t turn this down.</p>
<p>By the way, my thanks to the producers</p>
<p>for thinking I&rsquo;d be good at that gig.</p>
<p>Now, in addition to that,</p>
<p>the long-awaited, much-anticipated</p>
<p>virtual reality project that I&rsquo;ve been working on</p>
<p>for a while is here.</p>
<p>The World War I experience,</p>
<p>we call it War Remains, by the way.</p>
<p>It debuted at the Tribeca Film Festival</p>
<p>not even quite a month ago, I don&rsquo;t think.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s getting rave reviews, I guess,</p>
<p>is the only way to say.</p>
<p>I mean, you know, I&rsquo;m not a big self-promoter,</p>
<p>although I&rsquo;m going to have to learn in the near future,</p>
<p>I guess, but it looks like people like it.</p>
<p>You know me, I always, with everything I do,</p>
<p>think about what I would have done differently.</p>
<p>And my main complaint about War Remains</p>
<p>is it&rsquo;s not long enough.</p>
<p>Why can&rsquo;t it be as long as a podcast?</p>
<p>Why can&rsquo;t I have you in my virtual reality experience</p>
<p>for six hours?</p>
<p>I will transform you,</p>
<p>but there might be some counseling involved afterwards.</p>
<p>So, you know, more responsible and intelligent people</p>
<p>talked me back from the ledge on that.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ve been working with some really, really good folk,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ve made a really cool thing.</p>
<p>I mean, the sound was done by Skywalker.</p>
<p>I mean, okay, who do you want doing your sound?</p>
<p>Brandon Oldenburg, an award-winning creative artist,</p>
<p>put this whole thing together.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re in a room with him</p>
<p>and you watch him start drawing on the board,</p>
<p>you just sit there and go, holy crap.</p>
<p>Madison Wells was in charge of this whole thing,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re doing movies now.</p>
<p>So, I mean, it was a really cool group of people to work with.</p>
<p>And what they put together was, we call it a taste,</p>
<p>a taste of the trench warfare in the First World War.</p>
<p>And the reason we call it a taste is because</p>
<p>the first thing you have to acknowledge</p>
<p>even trying to do something like this</p>
<p>is it&rsquo;s nothing like the real thing, right?</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;re not going to get hurt.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not going to come back with a leg missing.</p>
<p>What we always try to say, though,</p>
<p>is it&rsquo;s nothing like the real thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just more like the real thing</p>
<p>than anything you&rsquo;ve been exposed to yet.</p>
<p>And there were some really interesting meetings</p>
<p>during the creative sessions for this whole thing</p>
<p>where you ask these really interesting questions.</p>
<p>One of the questions was relating to how we form</p>
<p>a mental conception of things, like war.</p>
<p>And we tried to imagine if you had never seen a war movie</p>
<p>or modern or like World War II warfare</p>
<p>portrayed on television.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d only read about it or only heard a radio report of it</p>
<p>or something like that, how much different</p>
<p>would your mental visualization of what that looked like be?</p>
<p>The motion picture version of, let&rsquo;s just say,</p>
<p>Second World War combat allows you to get a much better idea</p>
<p>of what it visually and audibly sounded like, right?</p>
<p>A better impression of what it really was.</p>
<p>Now, is that anything like it really was?</p>
<p>Not really.</p>
<p>I mean, you know, war on the ground is war on the ground</p>
<p>and watching a movie is watching a movie,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s more like a book.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more like war than a radio broadcast.</p>
<p>And this virtual reality production is more like</p>
<p>the First World War than anything else you&rsquo;ve seen.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all we can say about it.</p>
<p>My goal from the very beginning was to get as close</p>
<p>to realistic as possible.</p>
<p>There was a problem with that.</p>
<p>And this was one of the second big questions</p>
<p>and conversations that happened during the creative meetings.</p>
<p>How close do you want to simulate</p>
<p>a negative human experience?</p>
<p>Because we&rsquo;re all curious about this,</p>
<p>but we don&rsquo;t want to get our legs blown off.</p>
<p>And we had to sit there and try to figure out</p>
<p>how uncomfortable to make it.</p>
<p>Because you can already, I mean, Skywalker could turn up</p>
<p>the sound and blow your eardrums out, right?</p>
<p>But who wants to pay to get a ticket for that?</p>
<p>And yet, one of my military history professors</p>
<p>used to yell at us all the time.</p>
<p>And it took me a long time to realize</p>
<p>he wasn&rsquo;t yelling at me, he was yelling at him.</p>
<p>He said he wasn&rsquo;t yelling because he was a yeller,</p>
<p>he was yelling because he was half deaf,</p>
<p>because he was an artillery guy.</p>
<p>And in war, during these periods where a lot of these big guns</p>
<p>are firing, people&rsquo;s hearing gets damaged.</p>
<p>So if you want to have an experience more like</p>
<p>the veterans, should we damage your hearing?</p>
<p>I was probably on the we should damage your hearing side.</p>
<p>The more responsible people talked me out of that.</p>
<p>But you could see what an interesting dilemma it is.</p>
<p>If I was promising to take you into a virtual reality</p>
<p>experience of, you know, 18th century dentistry,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;ll seem real, I doubt you&rsquo;re buying a ticket for that, right?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s these interesting questions that come up</p>
<p>about how real you want to make it.</p>
<p>And, you know, and you&rsquo;re trying to hit the sweet spot of people.</p>
<p>Because some people are going to be really hardcore</p>
<p>and can handle more, and some people are going to be</p>
<p>really soft core and need less.</p>
<p>So how do you know where is the sweet spot for people?</p>
<p>And we thought about it something like, you know, Jaws.</p>
<p>When I was a kid and you went to see the movie Jaws.</p>
<p>I mean, it was so, at the time, it was so scary</p>
<p>that it scared people from going to see the movie.</p>
<p>And yet at the same time, it created this attraction</p>
<p>where you kind of wanted to see it.</p>
<p>I kept telling the guys we were doing this with,</p>
<p>and I liked everybody we were working with,</p>
<p>flight school guys, I mean, everybody.</p>
<p>I kept telling them that this is exactly the kind of thing</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d want to go to.</p>
<p>And so I kind of had that in the back of my mind the whole time.</p>
<p>What would I like to see?</p>
<p>One of the things we didn&rsquo;t do is we consciously didn&rsquo;t come up</p>
<p>with a story or a person to follow.</p>
<p>We consciously didn&rsquo;t try to tell you</p>
<p>how to interpret what you were seeing.</p>
<p>And we had discussions, and I was talking about people</p>
<p>like Ernst Junger, you know, from the Storm of Steel book,</p>
<p>where he didn&rsquo;t have the typical reaction</p>
<p>that you get in books like All Quiet on the Western Front,</p>
<p>where you get this terrible anti-war feeling</p>
<p>from all the waste and all the carnage and all that,</p>
<p>which is pretty typical.</p>
<p>But there were people that felt differently about it, right?</p>
<p>It had a whole different take on it.</p>
<p>So we focused more on the experience itself</p>
<p>and figured that you would have a chance afterwards</p>
<p>to sort of take it all in and decide how you felt about it</p>
<p>and how you interpreted it</p>
<p>and what sort of lens you saw it through.</p>
<p>I hope you like it. I hope you get a chance to see it.</p>
<p>It was a lot of fun, and it&rsquo;s creativity</p>
<p>on a really wild level</p>
<p>when you add the virtual reality aspect to it.</p>
<p>My thanks to everybody involved.</p>
<p>Brandon, Ethan, all you guys.</p>
<p>Clint, Kisker, I&rsquo;m forgetting everybody,</p>
<p>but, you know, I&rsquo;ll have time to thank everybody.</p>
<p>Finally, there is a book that I&rsquo;ve been working on</p>
<p>for some time, but you know me, not long enough.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been interesting working with deadlines again.</p>
<p>As I tell you that the next big Hardcore History Show</p>
<p>is going to be delayed,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not something you can get away with</p>
<p>in the literary world,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s been interesting working with deadlines again.</p>
<p>And I just want to say that it was really interesting</p>
<p>consciously knowing that things were not going to be</p>
<p>as easy to do as people suggested,</p>
<p>but, you know, that means I think I consciously</p>
<p>or unconsciously wanted to do this opportunity,</p>
<p>so there will be a book for you</p>
<p>in the not-too-distant future.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have a final name for you yet,</p>
<p>nor do I have a release date.</p>
<p>More will be forthcoming on that,</p>
<p>but the majority of the heavy lifting is over.</p>
<p>Again, it probably delayed the next show a little bit.</p>
<p>I hope that when, you know,</p>
<p>all the spinning plates are taken together,</p>
<p>you think it was worth it.</p>
<p>And, folks, we&rsquo;ve said this before.</p>
<p>I know it sounds like pandering,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s really the way I feel.</p>
<p>I understand that none of these opportunities are here,</p>
<p>except for the podcast and the listeners.</p>
<p>And so, thank you. I appreciate your patience.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re the best crowd in the world when it comes to that.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got you well-trained, don&rsquo;t we?</p>
<p>But, you know, I&rsquo;ve missed y&rsquo;all.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s nice to be back.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really feel like I was gone,</p>
<p>but sometimes we feel like we&rsquo;re off the air</p>
<p>sometimes around here, but we&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>You know, you can follow us, by the way,</p>
<p>at Hardcore History.</p>
<p>The War Remains folk also have a Twitter handle.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s at WarRemains.</p>
<p>You can hashtag WarRemains, too.</p>
<p>And when the book gets a little farther along</p>
<p>and I have more to report, there will be updates.</p>
<p>We are currently working on Supernova in the East,</p>
<p>part three. It&rsquo;s underway, don&rsquo;t worry.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know when it&rsquo;s coming out, but I never do,</p>
<p>because, after all, one of the wonderful benefits</p>
<p>of this podcast and your indulgence</p>
<p>is that I don&rsquo;t have to work around any hard deadlines.</p>
<p>We can just focus more importantly</p>
<p>that it at least meets my minimum, you know,</p>
<p>quality standards, and I can almost guarantee you</p>
<p>the next one will.</p>
<p>And hopefully it won&rsquo;t be too far in the distance,</p>
<p>and hopefully there&rsquo;ll be another Hardcore History</p>
<p>addendum show before too long.</p>
<p>Nice to talk with y&rsquo;all again.</p>
