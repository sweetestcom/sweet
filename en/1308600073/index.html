    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>where we discuss science</p>
<p>and science-based tools for everyday life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Andrew Huberman,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology</p>
<p>at Stanford School of Medicine.</p>
<p>Today, we are discussing memory,</p>
<p>in particular, how to improve your memory.</p>
<p>Now, the study of memory is one</p>
<p>that dates back many decades.</p>
<p>And by now, there&rsquo;s a pretty good understanding</p>
<p>of how memories are formed in the brain,</p>
<p>the different structures involved</p>
<p>and some of the neurochemicals involved.</p>
<p>We will talk about some of that today.</p>
<p>Often overlooked, however,</p>
<p>is that memories are not just about learning.</p>
<p>Memories are also about placing your entire life</p>
<p>into a context.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because what&rsquo;s really special about the brain,</p>
<p>and in particular, the human brain,</p>
<p>is its ability to place events</p>
<p>in the context of past events,</p>
<p>the present, and future events,</p>
<p>and sometimes even combinations of the past and present,</p>
<p>or present and future, and so on.</p>
<p>So when we talk about memory,</p>
<p>what we&rsquo;re really talking about</p>
<p>is how your immediate experiences relate</p>
<p>to previous and future experiences.</p>
<p>Today, I&rsquo;m going to make clear how that process occurs.</p>
<p>Even if you don&rsquo;t have a background in biology or psychology,</p>
<p>I promise to put it into language</p>
<p>that anyone can access and understand.</p>
<p>And we are going to talk about the science</p>
<p>that points to specific tools</p>
<p>for enhancing learning and memory.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re also going to talk about unlearning and forgetting.</p>
<p>There are, of course, instances</p>
<p>in which we would like to forget things.</p>
<p>And that too is a biological process</p>
<p>for which great tools exist to, for instance,</p>
<p>eliminate or at least reduce the emotional load</p>
<p>of our previous experience that you really did not like,</p>
<p>or that perhaps even was traumatic to you.</p>
<p>So today, you&rsquo;re going to learn</p>
<p>about the systems in the brain and body</p>
<p>that establish memories.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to learn why certain memories</p>
<p>are easier to form than others.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m going to talk about specific tools</p>
<p>that are grounded in not just one,</p>
<p>not just a dozen,</p>
<p>but well over a hundred studies in animals and humans</p>
<p>that point to specific protocols</p>
<p>that you can use in order to stamp down</p>
<p>learning of particular things more easily.</p>
<p>And you can also leverage that same knowledge</p>
<p>to better forget or unload the emotional weight</p>
<p>of experiences that you did not like.</p>
<p>We are also going to discuss topics like deja vu</p>
<p>and photographic memory.</p>
<p>And for those of you that do not have a photographic memory,</p>
<p>and I should point out</p>
<p>that I do not have a photographic memory either.</p>
<p>Well, you will learn how to use your visual system</p>
<p>in order to better learn visual and auditory information.</p>
<p>There are protocols to do this</p>
<p>grounded in excellent peer-reviewed research.</p>
<p>So while you may not have a true photographic memory,</p>
<p>by the end of the episode, you will have tools in hand,</p>
<p>or I should say tools in mind or in eyes and mind</p>
<p>to be able to encode and remember specific events</p>
<p>better than you would otherwise.</p>
<p>Before we begin, I&rsquo;d like to emphasize</p>
<p>that this podcast is separate from my teaching</p>
<p>and research roles at Stanford.</p>
<p>It is however, part of my desire and effort</p>
<p>to bring zero cost to consumer information</p>
<p>about science and science-related tools</p>
<p>to the general public.</p>
<p>In keeping with that theme,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank the sponsors of today&rsquo;s podcast.</p>
<p>Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens.</p>
<p>Athletic Greens is an all-in-one</p>
<p>vitamin mineral probiotic drink.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been taking Athletic Greens since 2012.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m delighted that they&rsquo;re sponsoring the podcast.</p>
<p>The reason I started taking Athletic Greens</p>
<p>and the reason I still take Athletic Greens</p>
<p>once or twice a day is that it helps me cover</p>
<p>all of my basic nutritional needs.</p>
<p>It makes up for any deficiencies that I might have.</p>
<p>In addition, it has probiotics,</p>
<p>which are vital for microbiome health.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done a couple of episodes now</p>
<p>on the so-called gut microbiome</p>
<p>and the ways in which the microbiome interacts</p>
<p>with your immune system, with your brain to regulate mood,</p>
<p>and essentially with every biological system</p>
<p>relevant to health throughout your brain and body.</p>
<p>With Athletic Greens, I get the vitamins I need,</p>
<p>the minerals I need,</p>
<p>and the probiotics to support my microbiome.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Athletic Greens,</p>
<p>you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>and claim a special offer.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll give you five free travel packs,</p>
<p>plus a year supply of vitamin D3K2.</p>
<p>There are a ton of data now showing that vitamin D3</p>
<p>is essential for various aspects of our brain</p>
<p>and body health.</p>
<p>Even if we&rsquo;re getting a lot of sunshine,</p>
<p>many of us are still deficient in vitamin D3.</p>
<p>And K2 is also important because it regulates things</p>
<p>like cardiovascular function, calcium in the body,</p>
<p>and so on.</p>
<p>Again, go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>to claim the special offer of the five free travel packs</p>
<p>and the year supply of vitamin D3K2.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Element.</p>
<p>Element is an electrolyte drink</p>
<p>that has everything you need and nothing you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>That means the exact ratios of electrolytes are an element,</p>
<p>and those are sodium, magnesium, and potassium,</p>
<p>but it has no sugar.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked many times before on this podcast</p>
<p>about the key role of hydration and electrolytes</p>
<p>for nerve cell function, neuron function,</p>
<p>as well as the function of all the cells</p>
<p>and all the tissues and organ systems of the body.</p>
<p>If we have sodium, magnesium, and potassium</p>
<p>present in the proper ratios,</p>
<p>all of those cells function properly,</p>
<p>and all our bodily systems can be optimized.</p>
<p>If the electrolytes are not present,</p>
<p>and if hydration is low,</p>
<p>we simply can&rsquo;t think as well as we would otherwise,</p>
<p>our mood is off, hormone systems go off,</p>
<p>our ability to get into physical action,</p>
<p>to engage in endurance and strength,</p>
<p>and all sorts of other things is diminished.</p>
<p>So with Element, you can make sure</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re staying on top of your hydration</p>
<p>and that you&rsquo;re getting the proper ratios of electrolytes.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Element, you can go to drinkelement,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s lmnt.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll get a free Element sample pack</p>
<p>with your purchase.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all delicious.</p>
<p>So again, if you want to try Element,</p>
<p>you can go to elementlmnt.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Thesis.</p>
<p>Thesis makes what are called nootropics,</p>
<p>which means smart drugs.</p>
<p>Now, to be honest, I am not a fan of the term nootropics.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe in smart drugs in the sense that,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe that there&rsquo;s any one substance</p>
<p>or collection of substances that can make us smarter.</p>
<p>I do believe based on science, however,</p>
<p>that there are particular neural circuits</p>
<p>and brain functions that allow us to be more focused,</p>
<p>more alert, access creativity, be more motivated, et cetera.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just the way that the brain works.</p>
<p>Different neural circuits for different brain states.</p>
<p>Thesis understands this.</p>
<p>And as far as I know, they&rsquo;re the first nootropics company</p>
<p>to create targeted nootropics for specific outcomes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Thesis for more than six months now,</p>
<p>and I can confidently say that their nootropics</p>
<p>have been a total game changer.</p>
<p>My go-to formula is the clarity formula,</p>
<p>or sometimes I&rsquo;ll use their energy formula before training.</p>
<p>To get your own personalized nootropic starter kit,</p>
<p>go online to takethesis.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>take a three minute quiz,</p>
<p>and Thesis will send you four different formulas</p>
<p>to try in your first month.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s takethesis.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>and use the code Huberman at checkout</p>
<p>for 10% off your first order.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pleased to announce that the Huberman Lab Podcast</p>
<p>has now partnered with Momentus Supplements.</p>
<p>We partnered with Momentus for several important reasons.</p>
<p>First of all, they ship internationally,</p>
<p>because we know that many of you are located</p>
<p>outside of the United States.</p>
<p>Second of all, and perhaps most important,</p>
<p>the quality of their supplements is second to none,</p>
<p>both in terms of purity and precision</p>
<p>of the amounts of the ingredients.</p>
<p>Third, we&rsquo;ve really emphasized supplements</p>
<p>that are single ingredient supplements,</p>
<p>and that are supplied in dosages</p>
<p>that allow you to build a supplementation protocol</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for cost,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for effectiveness,</p>
<p>and that you can add things and remove things</p>
<p>from your protocol in a way</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really systematic and scientific.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to see the supplements</p>
<p>that we partner with Momentus on,</p>
<p>you can go to livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>There you&rsquo;ll see those supplements,</p>
<p>and just keep in mind that we are constantly expanding</p>
<p>the library of supplements available through Momentus</p>
<p>on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>Okay, let&rsquo;s talk about memory,</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s talk about how to get better</p>
<p>at remembering things.</p>
<p>Now, in order to address both of those things,</p>
<p>we need to do a little bit of brain science 101 review,</p>
<p>and I promise this will only take two minutes,</p>
<p>and I promise that even if you don&rsquo;t have a background</p>
<p>in biology, it will make sense.</p>
<p>We are constantly being bombarded with physical stimuli,</p>
<p>patterns of touch on our skin, light to our eyes,</p>
<p>light to our skin for that matter,</p>
<p>smells, tastes, and sound waves.</p>
<p>In fact, if you can hear me saying this right now,</p>
<p>well, that&rsquo;s the consequence of sound waves</p>
<p>arriving into your ears through headphones, a computer,</p>
<p>or some other speaker device.</p>
<p>Each one of, and all of those sensory stimuli</p>
<p>are converted into electricity and chemical signals</p>
<p>by your so-called nervous system,</p>
<p>your brain, your spinal cord,</p>
<p>and all their connections with the organs of the body,</p>
<p>and all the connections of your organs of the body</p>
<p>back to your brain and spinal cord.</p>
<p>One of the primary jobs of your nervous system, in fact,</p>
<p>is to convert physical events in the world</p>
<p>that are non-negotiable, right?</p>
<p>Photons of light are photons of light.</p>
<p>Sound waves are sound waves.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no changing that,</p>
<p>but your nervous system does change that.</p>
<p>It converts those things into electrical signals</p>
<p>and chemical signals,</p>
<p>which are the language of your nervous system.</p>
<p>Now, just because you&rsquo;re being bombarded</p>
<p>with all the sensory information,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s being converted into a language that neurons</p>
<p>and the rest of your nervous system can understand</p>
<p>does not mean that you are aware of it all.</p>
<p>In fact, you are only going to perceive a small amount</p>
<p>of that sensory information.</p>
<p>For instance, if you can hear me speaking right now,</p>
<p>you are perceiving my voice,</p>
<p>but you are also most likely neglecting the feeling</p>
<p>of the contact of your skin with whichever surface</p>
<p>you happen to be sitting or standing on.</p>
<p>So it is only by perceiving a subset,</p>
<p>a small fraction of the sensory events in our environment,</p>
<p>that we can make sense of the world around us.</p>
<p>Otherwise we would just be overwhelmed</p>
<p>with all the things that are happening</p>
<p>in any one given moment.</p>
<p>Now, memory is simply a bias in which perceptions</p>
<p>will be replayed again in the future.</p>
<p>Anytime you experience something,</p>
<p>that is the consequence of specific chains of neurons</p>
<p>that we call neural circuits being activated.</p>
<p>And memory is simply a bias in the likelihood</p>
<p>that that specific chain of neurons will be activated again.</p>
<p>So for instance, if you can remember your name,</p>
<p>and I certainly hope that you can,</p>
<p>well, that means that there are specific chains</p>
<p>of neurons in your brain that represent your name.</p>
<p>And when those neurons connect with one another</p>
<p>and communicate electrically with one another</p>
<p>in a particular sequence, you remember your name.</p>
<p>Were that particular chain of neurons to be disrupted,</p>
<p>you would not be able to remember your name.</p>
<p>Now, this might seem immensely simple,</p>
<p>but it raises this really interesting question,</p>
<p>which we talked about before,</p>
<p>which is why do we remember certain things and not others?</p>
<p>Because according to what I&rsquo;ve just said,</p>
<p>as you go through life,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re experiencing things all the time.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re constantly being bombarded with sensory stimuli.</p>
<p>Some of those sensory stimuli you perceive,</p>
<p>and only some of those perceptions</p>
<p>get stamped down as memories.</p>
<p>Today, I&rsquo;m going to teach you how certain things</p>
<p>get stamped down as memories.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m going to teach you how to leverage that process</p>
<p>in order to remember the information</p>
<p>that you want far better.</p>
<p>Now, even though I&rsquo;ve told you that a memory</p>
<p>is simply a bias in the likelihood</p>
<p>that a particular chain of neurons will be activated</p>
<p>in a particular sequence again and again,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t operate on its own.</p>
<p>In fact, most of what we remember</p>
<p>takes place in a context of other events.</p>
<p>So for instance, you can most likely remember your name,</p>
<p>and yet you&rsquo;re probably not thinking about</p>
<p>when it was that you first learned your name.</p>
<p>This generally happens</p>
<p>when we are very, very young children.</p>
<p>And yet, I&rsquo;m guessing you could probably remember</p>
<p>a time when someone mispronounced your name</p>
<p>or made fun of your name,</p>
<p>or as the case was for me,</p>
<p>I got to the third grade and there were two Andrews.</p>
<p>And sadly for me, I lost the coin flip</p>
<p>that allowed me to keep Andrew.</p>
<p>And from about third grade until about 12th grade,</p>
<p>people called me Andy, which I really did not prefer.</p>
<p>So if you call me Andy in the comments,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll delete your comment.</p>
<p>Just kidding, doesn&rsquo;t bother me that much.</p>
<p>But eventually I reclaimed Andrew as my name.</p>
<p>Well, it was mine to begin with and throughout,</p>
<p>but I started going by Andrew again.</p>
<p>Why do I say this?</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s a whole context to my name for me.</p>
<p>And there may or may not be a whole context</p>
<p>to your name for you,</p>
<p>but presumably if you asked your parents</p>
<p>why they named you your given name,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll get a context, et cetera.</p>
<p>That context reflects the activation</p>
<p>of other neural circuits that are also related</p>
<p>to other events in your life, not just your name,</p>
<p>but probably your siblings&rsquo; names</p>
<p>and who your parents are and on and on and on.</p>
<p>And so the way memory works is that each individual thing</p>
<p>that we remember or that we want to remember</p>
<p>is linked to something by either a close,</p>
<p>a medium, or a very distant association.</p>
<p>This turns out to be immensely important.</p>
<p>I know many of you will read or will encounter programs</p>
<p>that are designed to help you enhance your memory.</p>
<p>You know, you have these phenomes that can remember</p>
<p>50 names in a room full of people,</p>
<p>or they can remember a bunch of names of novel objects</p>
<p>or maybe even in different languages.</p>
<p>And oftentimes that&rsquo;s done by association.</p>
<p>So people will come up with little mental tricks</p>
<p>to either link the sound of a word</p>
<p>or the meaning of a word in some way</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s meaningful for them and will enhance their memory.</p>
<p>That can be done and is impressive when we see it.</p>
<p>And for those of you who can do that, congratulations.</p>
<p>Most of us can&rsquo;t do that,</p>
<p>or at least it requires a lot of effort and training.</p>
<p>However, there are things that we can do</p>
<p>that leverage the natural biology of our nervous system</p>
<p>to enhance learning and memory of particular perceptions</p>
<p>and particular information.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s first just talk about the most basic ways</p>
<p>that we learn and remember things</p>
<p>and how to improve learning and memory.</p>
<p>And the most basic one is repetition.</p>
<p>Now, the study of memory and the role of repetition</p>
<p>actually dates back to the late 1800s, early 1900s,</p>
<p>when Ebbinghaus developed</p>
<p>the first so-called learning curves.</p>
<p>Now, learning curves are simply what results</p>
<p>when you quantify how many repetitions of something</p>
<p>are required in order to remember something.</p>
<p>In fact, it&rsquo;s been said that Ebbinghaus liberated</p>
<p>the understanding of learning from the philosophers</p>
<p>by generating these learning curves.</p>
<p>What do we mean by that?</p>
<p>Well, before Ebbinghaus came along,</p>
<p>learning and memory were thought to be philosophical ideas.</p>
<p>Ebbinghaus came along and said,</p>
<p>well, let&rsquo;s actually take some measurements.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s measure how well I can remember a sequence of words</p>
<p>or a sequence of numbers if I just repeat them.</p>
<p>So what Ebbinghaus did is he would take a sequence of</p>
<p>numbers or words on a page and he would read them.</p>
<p>And then he would take a separate sheet of paper</p>
<p>and we have to presume he didn&rsquo;t cheat.</p>
<p>And he would write down as many of them as he could.</p>
<p>And he would try and keep them in the same sequence.</p>
<p>Then he would compare to the original list</p>
<p>and he would see how many errors he made.</p>
<p>And you do this over and over and over again.</p>
<p>And as you would expect early in the training</p>
<p>and the learning, it took a lot more repetitions</p>
<p>to get the sequence correct.</p>
<p>And over time it took fewer sequences.</p>
<p>And he referred to that difference in the initial number</p>
<p>of repetitions that he had to perform</p>
<p>versus the later number of repetitions</p>
<p>that he had to perform as a so-called savings.</p>
<p>So he literally thought of the brain as having to generate</p>
<p>a kind of a currency of effort.</p>
<p>And he talked about savings as the reduction</p>
<p>in the amount of effort that he had to put forward</p>
<p>in order to learn information.</p>
<p>And what he got was a learning curve.</p>
<p>And you can imagine what that learning curve looked like.</p>
<p>It was at a very sharp peak at the beginning</p>
<p>that dropped off over time.</p>
<p>And of course he remembered</p>
<p>all this meaningless information.</p>
<p>But even though the information might&rsquo;ve been meaningless,</p>
<p>the experiment itself and what Ebbinghaus demonstrated</p>
<p>was immensely meaningful.</p>
<p>Because what it said was that with repetition,</p>
<p>we can activate particular sequences of neurons</p>
<p>and that repeated activation lays down</p>
<p>what we call a memory.</p>
<p>And that might all seem like a big duh,</p>
<p>but prior to Ebbinghaus, none of that was known.</p>
<p>Now I should also say Ebbinghaus,</p>
<p>because of when he was alive,</p>
<p>was not aware of these things that we call neural circuits.</p>
<p>It was in 1906 that Golgi and Cajal got the Nobel prize</p>
<p>for actually showing that neurons are independent cells</p>
<p>connected by synapses,</p>
<p>these little gaps between them where they communicate.</p>
<p>So he may have been aware of that,</p>
<p>but the whole notion of neural circuits</p>
<p>hadn&rsquo;t really come about.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, what the Ebbinghaus learning curves</p>
<p>really established was that sheer repetition,</p>
<p>just repeating things over and over and over again</p>
<p>is sufficient to learn.</p>
<p>Something that no doubt had been observed before,</p>
<p>but it had never been formally quantified.</p>
<p>Now, if we look at that result,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something really important</p>
<p>that lies a little bit cryptic,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not so obvious to most people,</p>
<p>which is the information that he was trying to learn</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t any more interesting the second time</p>
<p>than it was the first,</p>
<p>probably was even less interesting</p>
<p>and less and less interesting with each repetition.</p>
<p>And yet it was sheer repetition</p>
<p>that allowed him to remember.</p>
<p>Now, sometime later in the early to mid 1920s,</p>
<p>a psychologist in Canada named Donald Hebb</p>
<p>came up with what was called Hebb&rsquo;s postulate.</p>
<p>And Hebb&rsquo;s postulate, broadly speaking,</p>
<p>is this idea that if a sequence of neurons is active</p>
<p>at the same time, or at roughly the same time,</p>
<p>that that would lead to a strengthening of the connections</p>
<p>between those neurons.</p>
<p>And many, many decades of experimentation later,</p>
<p>we now know that postulate to be true.</p>
<p>Neurons themselves are not smart,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t have knowledge.</p>
<p>So every memory is the consequence,</p>
<p>as I told you before,</p>
<p>of the repeated activation of a particular chain of neurons.</p>
<p>And what Ebbinghaus showed through repetition</p>
<p>and what Donald Hebb proposed</p>
<p>and was eventually verified through experimentation</p>
<p>on animals and humans,</p>
<p>was that if you encourage the co-activation of neurons,</p>
<p>meaning have neurons fire at roughly the same time,</p>
<p>they will strengthen their connections.</p>
<p>It leads to a bias in the probability</p>
<p>that those neurons will be active again.</p>
<p>Now, this is vitally important</p>
<p>because nowadays we hear a lot</p>
<p>about how memories are the consequence</p>
<p>of new neurons added in the brain,</p>
<p>or that every time you learn something,</p>
<p>a new connection in your brain forms.</p>
<p>Well, sorry to break it to you,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s simply not the case.</p>
<p>Most of the time, and I want to emphasize most,</p>
<p>not all, but most of the time when we learn something,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s because existing neurons, not new neurons,</p>
<p>but existing neurons strengthen their connection</p>
<p>through co-activation over and over and over</p>
<p>through repetition, or, and this is a very important or,</p>
<p>or through very strong activation once and only once.</p>
<p>In fact, there&rsquo;s something called one trial learning</p>
<p>whereby we experience something</p>
<p>and we will remember that thing forever.</p>
<p>This is often most associated with negative events,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll explain why in a few minutes,</p>
<p>but it can also be associated with positive events,</p>
<p>like the first time you saw your romantic partner</p>
<p>or something that happened with that romantic partner,</p>
<p>or the first time that you saw your child,</p>
<p>or any other positive event,</p>
<p>as well as any other extremely negative event.</p>
<p>So again, both repetition and,</p>
<p>I guess we could label it intensity,</p>
<p>but what we really mean when we say intensity</p>
<p>is strong activation of neurons can lay down these traces,</p>
<p>these circuits that are far more likely to be active again,</p>
<p>than had there not been repetition</p>
<p>or not some strong activation of those circuits.</p>
<p>So with that in mind,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s return to the original contrarian question</p>
<p>that I raised before,</p>
<p>which is why do we remember anything?</p>
<p>Every day you wake up,</p>
<p>your neurons in your brain and body are active,</p>
<p>different neural circuits are active,</p>
<p>and yet you only remember a small fraction</p>
<p>of the things that happen each day,</p>
<p>and yet you retain a lot of information</p>
<p>from previous days and the days before those and so on.</p>
<p>It is only with a lot of repetition</p>
<p>or with extremely strong activation of a given neural circuit</p>
<p>that we will create new memories.</p>
<p>And so in a few minutes,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll explain how to get extremely strong activation</p>
<p>of particular neural circuits.</p>
<p>Repetition is pretty obvious, repetition is repetition,</p>
<p>but in a few minutes,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll illustrate a whole set of experiments</p>
<p>and a whole set of tools that point to how you can get</p>
<p>extra strong activation of a given neural circuit</p>
<p>as it relates to learning</p>
<p>so that you will remember that information,</p>
<p>perhaps not just with one trial of learning,</p>
<p>but certainly with far fewer repetitions</p>
<p>than would be required otherwise.</p>
<p>Before we go any further,</p>
<p>I want to preface the discussion by saying</p>
<p>that there are a lot of different kinds of memory.</p>
<p>In fact, were you to take a voyage into the neuroscience</p>
<p>and or psychology of memory,</p>
<p>you would find an immense number of different terms</p>
<p>to describe the immense number of different types of memory</p>
<p>that researchers focus on.</p>
<p>But for sake of today&rsquo;s discussion,</p>
<p>really just want to focus on short-term memory,</p>
<p>medium-term memory, and long-term memory.</p>
<p>And while there&rsquo;s still debate,</p>
<p>as is always the case with scientists, frankly,</p>
<p>about the exact divisions between short-term,</p>
<p>medium, and long-term memory,</p>
<p>we can broadly define short-term memory</p>
<p>and long-term memory,</p>
<p>and we can describe a couple of different types of those</p>
<p>that I think you can relate to in your everyday life.</p>
<p>The most common form of short-term memory</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re going to focus on is called working memory.</p>
<p>Working memory is your ability to keep a chain of numbers</p>
<p>in mind for some period of time,</p>
<p>but the expectation really isn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>that you would remember those numbers the next day,</p>
<p>and certainly not the next week.</p>
<p>So a good example would be a phone number.</p>
<p>If I were to tell you a phone number, 493-2938,</p>
<p>well, you could probably remember it, 493-2938.</p>
<p>But if I came back tomorrow and asked you</p>
<p>to repeat that chain of numbers, most likely you would not,</p>
<p>unless, of course, we used a particular tool</p>
<p>to stamp down that memory into your mind</p>
<p>and commit it to long-term memory.</p>
<p>Now, of course, in this day and age,</p>
<p>most people have phone numbers programmed into their phone.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t really have to remember the exact numbers.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s usually done by contact identity and so forth.</p>
<p>So a different example</p>
<p>that some of you are probably more familiar with</p>
<p>would be those security codes.</p>
<p>So you try and log on to an app or a website,</p>
<p>and it asks you for a security code</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s been sent to your text messages,</p>
<p>and then you can either plug that in directly in some cases,</p>
<p>or you have to remember that short sequence of anywhere,</p>
<p>usually from six to seven, sometimes eight numbers.</p>
<p>Your ability to do that, to switch back and forth</p>
<p>between webpages or apps and plug in that number</p>
<p>by remembering the sequence and plugging it in</p>
<p>by texting or keying it in on your keyboard,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a really good example of working memory.</p>
<p>Long-term memory of the sort</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re going to be talking a lot about today</p>
<p>is your ability to commit certain patterns of information,</p>
<p>either cognitive information or motor information, right?</p>
<p>The ability to move your limbs in a particular sequence</p>
<p>over long periods of time,</p>
<p>such that you could remember it a day or a week or a month,</p>
<p>or maybe even a year or several years later.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve got short-term memory and long-term memory,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ve got this working memory,</p>
<p>which is kind of keeping something online,</p>
<p>but then discarding it, okay?</p>
<p>Not online on a computer, but online within your brain.</p>
<p>There are also two major categories of memory</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;d like you to know about.</p>
<p>One is explicit memory.</p>
<p>So this is not necessarily explicit of the sort</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re used to thinking about,</p>
<p>but rather the fact that you can declare you know something.</p>
<p>So you have an explicit memory of your name.</p>
<p>Presumably you have an explicit memory</p>
<p>of the house or the apartment that you grew up in.</p>
<p>You know something and you know you know it,</p>
<p>and you can declare it.</p>
<p>So I can ask you,</p>
<p>what was the color of the first car that you owned?</p>
<p>Or what is the color of your romantic partner&rsquo;s hair?</p>
<p>These sorts of things.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an explicit declarative memory,</p>
<p>but you also have explicit procedural memories.</p>
<p>Now, procedural memories, as the name suggests,</p>
<p>involve action sequences.</p>
<p>The simplest one, it&rsquo;s almost ridiculously simple,</p>
<p>is walking.</p>
<p>If I say, how is it that you walk</p>
<p>from one room to the other?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d probably say, well, I go that direction,</p>
<p>then I turn left.</p>
<p>I say, no, no, no, no.</p>
<p>How is it exactly that you do it?</p>
<p>And say, well, I move my left foot,</p>
<p>then my right foot, then my left foot.</p>
<p>And you could describe that.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s an explicit procedural memory.</p>
<p>So much so that if you were going to teach</p>
<p>a young toddler how to walk,</p>
<p>you would probably say, okay, good, good, try.</p>
<p>Okay, and you know,</p>
<p>probably that&rsquo;s going to be pre-language for the toddler,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re going to encourage them to move one leg,</p>
<p>then the other,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re going to encourage and reward them</p>
<p>for moving one leg, then the other,</p>
<p>because you have an explicit procedural memory</p>
<p>of how to walk.</p>
<p>Okay, almost ridiculously simple.</p>
<p>Maybe even truly ridiculously simple,</p>
<p>but nonetheless,</p>
<p>when you think about it in the context of neural circuits</p>
<p>and neural firing, pretty amazing.</p>
<p>Even more amazing is the fact that all explicit memories,</p>
<p>both declarative and procedural explicit memories,</p>
<p>can be moved from explicit to implicit.</p>
<p>What do I mean by that?</p>
<p>Well, in the example of walking,</p>
<p>you might&rsquo;ve chuckled a little bit</p>
<p>or kind of shook your head</p>
<p>and said, that&rsquo;s a ridiculous thing to ask.</p>
<p>How do I walk from one room to the next?</p>
<p>I just walk, I just do it.</p>
<p>Ah, well, what is just do it?</p>
<p>What it is, is that you have an implicit understanding,</p>
<p>meaning your nervous system knows how to walk</p>
<p>without you actually having to think about</p>
<p>what you know about how to walk.</p>
<p>You just get up out of your chair</p>
<p>or you get up out of bed and you walk.</p>
<p>In the brain, you have a structure.</p>
<p>In fact, you have one on each side of your brain.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called the hippocampus.</p>
<p>The hippocampus literally means seahorse.</p>
<p>Anatomists like to name brain structures</p>
<p>after things that they think those brain structures resemble.</p>
<p>When I look at the hippocampus,</p>
<p>frankly, it doesn&rsquo;t look like a seahorse,</p>
<p>which either reflects my lack of understanding</p>
<p>of what a seahorse really looks like, a visual deficit,</p>
<p>or I think it&rsquo;s fair to say that those anatomists</p>
<p>were using a little bit of creative elaboration</p>
<p>when thinking about what the hippocampus looks like.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, it is a curved structure.</p>
<p>It has many layers.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been described by my colleague, Robert Sapolsky,</p>
<p>and by others as looking more like a jelly roll</p>
<p>or a cinnamon roll is what it looks like to me.</p>
<p>And if you were to take one cinnamon roll,</p>
<p>chop it down the middle.</p>
<p>So now you&rsquo;ve got two half cinnamon rolls.</p>
<p>And rather than put them back together</p>
<p>in the configuration they were before,</p>
<p>you just slide one down so that you&rsquo;ve got</p>
<p>essentially two Cs, two C-shaped halves of the cinnamon roll</p>
<p>and you push them together, right?</p>
<p>Slightly offset from one another,</p>
<p>well, that&rsquo;s what the hippocampus looks like to me.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s a far better description</p>
<p>of its actual physical structure.</p>
<p>But I guess if you were to use that physical structure</p>
<p>as the name, well, then you&rsquo;d have to open up</p>
<p>a brain atlas and it would be called</p>
<p>two half C cinnamon rolls stuffed halfway together.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s not very good.</p>
<p>So I guess seahorse will work.</p>
<p>Hippocampus is the name of this structure</p>
<p>and it is the site in your brain.</p>
<p>And again, you have one on each side of your brain</p>
<p>in which explicit declarative memories are formed.</p>
<p>It is not where those memories are stored and maintained.</p>
<p>It is where they are established in the first place.</p>
<p>In contrast, implicit memories, right?</p>
<p>These subconscious memories are formed and stored</p>
<p>elsewhere in the brain,</p>
<p>mainly by areas like the cerebellum,</p>
<p>but also the neocortex,</p>
<p>the kind of outer shell of your brain.</p>
<p>The cerebellum is, it literally means mini brain.</p>
<p>And it does in fact look like a mini brain</p>
<p>and is in the back of the brain.</p>
<p>And the neocortex is the outer part of the brain</p>
<p>that covers all the other stuff.</p>
<p>So the hippocampus is vitally important for establishing</p>
<p>these new declarative memories of what you know</p>
<p>and what you know how to do.</p>
<p>Now, in order to really understand the role</p>
<p>of the hippocampus in memory,</p>
<p>in particular explicit declarative</p>
<p>and explicit procedural memory,</p>
<p>and to really understand how that&rsquo;s distinct</p>
<p>from implicit declarative and implicit procedural memories,</p>
<p>we have to look to a clinical case.</p>
<p>And the clinical case that I&rsquo;m referring to is a patient</p>
<p>who went by the name HM.</p>
<p>Patients go by their initials in order to maintain</p>
<p>confidentiality of their real identity.</p>
<p>HM had what&rsquo;s called intractable epilepsy.</p>
<p>So he would have these really dramatic</p>
<p>so-called grand mal seizures or drop seizures.</p>
<p>For those of you that know somebody with epilepsy</p>
<p>or that have epilepsy, you might be familiar with this.</p>
<p>You can have petite mal seizures, which are minor seizures.</p>
<p>You can have tonic-clonic seizures,</p>
<p>which are sometimes not even detectable.</p>
<p>You can have absent seizures where people will just stop.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost as if their brain kind of goes on pause</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll just stop there.</p>
<p>It was reported actually that Einstein had absent seizures,</p>
<p>although I don&rsquo;t know that that&rsquo;s ever really</p>
<p>been confirmed neurologically.</p>
<p>Grand mal seizures are extremely severe,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what HM had.</p>
<p>So he could just be going about his day</p>
<p>and maybe even cooking or doing something, driving,</p>
<p>operating any kind of machinery.</p>
<p>And then all of a sudden he would just have a drop seizure.</p>
<p>So he would just physically drop</p>
<p>and go into a grand mal seizure.</p>
<p>So convulsing of the whole body,</p>
<p>loss of consciousness, et cetera.</p>
<p>Or he would feel it coming on.</p>
<p>Oftentimes people with epilepsy can feel</p>
<p>the epilepsy seizure coming on kind of like a wave</p>
<p>from the back of the brain.</p>
<p>And sometimes they can get to a safe circumstance,</p>
<p>but not always.</p>
<p>And so the frequency and the intensity of his seizures</p>
<p>were so robust that the neurosurgeons and neurologists</p>
<p>decided that they need to locate the origin,</p>
<p>what they call the foci of those seizures,</p>
<p>and remove that brain tissue.</p>
<p>Because the way seizures work is they spread out</p>
<p>from that focus or that foci of brain tissue.</p>
<p>And unfortunately for HM,</p>
<p>the focus of his seizures was the hippocampus.</p>
<p>So after a lot of deliberation,</p>
<p>a neurosurgeon, in fact,</p>
<p>one of the most famous neurosurgeons in the world</p>
<p>at that time made what are called electrolytic lesions,</p>
<p>actually burned out the hippocampus in the brain of HM.</p>
<p>And as a consequence, he lost all explicit memory.</p>
<p>Now, the consequence of this was that he couldn&rsquo;t exist</p>
<p>in normal everyday life like most people.</p>
<p>So he had to live mostly, not entirely,</p>
<p>but mostly in a kind of hospital setting.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve talked to several people who have,</p>
<p>I should say, who met HM directly</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s no longer alive,</p>
<p>but an interaction with him might look like the following.</p>
<p>He would walk up to you just fine.</p>
<p>You wouldn&rsquo;t know that he had any kind of brain damage.</p>
<p>He could walk fine.</p>
<p>He could speak fine.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;d say, hi, I&rsquo;m Andrew.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;d say, hi, I&rsquo;m whatever his name happened to be.</p>
<p>He wouldn&rsquo;t say HM, but he&rsquo;d probably say his real name.</p>
<p>And then perhaps someone new would walk into the room.</p>
<p>He might turn around, look at that person</p>
<p>as any of us might do, then turn around back to me</p>
<p>and say, hi, what&rsquo;s your name?</p>
<p>And if I were to say, well, I just told you my name</p>
<p>and you just told me your name, do you remember that?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;d say, I&rsquo;m sorry, I don&rsquo;t remember any of that.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your name?</p>
<p>So you had to go through this over and over again.</p>
<p>So a complete lack of explicit declarative memory.</p>
<p>Now he did have some memory for previous events in his life</p>
<p>that dated way back, okay?</p>
<p>Again, hinting at the idea that memories</p>
<p>are not necessarily stored in the hippocampus.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just formed in the hippocampus.</p>
<p>So once they&rsquo;ve moved out of the hippocampus</p>
<p>to other brain areas, he could still keep those memories.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re in a different database, if you will.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re in a different pattern of firing</p>
<p>of other neural circuits, but he couldn&rsquo;t form new memories.</p>
<p>Now there&rsquo;s some very important and interesting twists</p>
<p>on what HM could and could not do</p>
<p>in terms of learning and memory</p>
<p>that teach us a lot about the brain.</p>
<p>In fact, I think most neuroscientists would agree</p>
<p>that this unfortunate case of HM&rsquo;s epilepsy</p>
<p>and the subsequent neurosurgery that he had</p>
<p>taught us much of what we know, or at least think about</p>
<p>in terms of human learning and memory.</p>
<p>For instance, as I mentioned before,</p>
<p>he still had implicit knowledge.</p>
<p>He knew how to walk.</p>
<p>He knew how to do certain things like make a cup of coffee.</p>
<p>He knew the names of people that he had met much earlier</p>
<p>in his life and so on.</p>
<p>And yet he couldn&rsquo;t form new memories.</p>
<p>Now, in violation to that last statement,</p>
<p>there were some elements of HM&rsquo;s emotionality</p>
<p>that suggests that there was some sort of residual capacity</p>
<p>to learn new information,</p>
<p>but it wasn&rsquo;t what we normally think of</p>
<p>as explicit declarative or procedural memory.</p>
<p>For instance, it&rsquo;s been reported or it&rsquo;s been said,</p>
<p>I should say, because I don&rsquo;t know that the studies</p>
<p>were ever done with intense physiological measurements,</p>
<p>that if you were to tell HM a joke</p>
<p>and he thought it was funny, he would laugh really hard.</p>
<p>So he liked jokes.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;d tell him, you&rsquo;d say,</p>
<p>HM, I want to tell you a joke.</p>
<p>You tell him a joke and he&rsquo;d laugh really hard.</p>
<p>Then you could leave the room, come back</p>
<p>and tell him the same joke again.</p>
<p>Now, keep in mind, he did not remember</p>
<p>that you told him the joke previously.</p>
<p>And the second time he would laugh a little bit less.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;d leave the room, come back again,</p>
<p>say, hi, I&rsquo;m Andrew.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;d say, oh, nice to meet you.</p>
<p>Because as you know, as you recall,</p>
<p>because you can recall things,</p>
<p>but he couldn&rsquo;t recall things.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t know that he just met you</p>
<p>or at least he couldn&rsquo;t remember it.</p>
<p>You tell him the joke a third time or a fourth time.</p>
<p>And with each subsequent telling of the joke,</p>
<p>he found it a little less funny,</p>
<p>just as, keep this in mind, folks,</p>
<p>if you tell a joke and you get a big laugh,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t tell it again, at least not immediately,</p>
<p>not to the same person or the same crowd,</p>
<p>because the second time it&rsquo;s a little less funny.</p>
<p>And the third time it&rsquo;s a little less funny.</p>
<p>And that actually has to do with a whole element</p>
<p>of dopamine and its relationship to surprise.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the topic of a future podcast</p>
<p>where we talk all about humor and novelty in the brain.</p>
<p>But the point being that certain forms of memory</p>
<p>seem to exist in a kind of phantom-like way</p>
<p>within HM&rsquo;s brain.</p>
<p>What do I mean by that?</p>
<p>Well, this underscores the fact</p>
<p>that he had an implicit memory</p>
<p>of having heard the joke before.</p>
<p>And it suggests that humor,</p>
<p>or at least what we find funny,</p>
<p>is somehow more related to procedures</p>
<p>similar to walking or a motor ability</p>
<p>than it is to this precise content of that joke.</p>
<p>All right, that&rsquo;s a little bit of an abstract concept,</p>
<p>but the point is that HM lacked</p>
<p>explicit declarative memory.</p>
<p>He couldn&rsquo;t tell you what he had just heard.</p>
<p>He could not learn new information.</p>
<p>And he couldn&rsquo;t tell you how to do something</p>
<p>unless he had learned how to do that something</p>
<p>many years prior.</p>
<p>Now, there&rsquo;ve been a lot of other patients besides HM</p>
<p>that have had brain lesions due to epilepsy,</p>
<p>or I should say due to surgeries to treat epilepsy,</p>
<p>due to strokes, due to sadly gunshot wounds</p>
<p>and other forms of what we call infarcts,</p>
<p>infarct, I-N-F-A-R-C-T, infarct,</p>
<p>is the word we use to describe damage</p>
<p>to a particular brain region.</p>
<p>And many different patients</p>
<p>with many different patterns of infarct</p>
<p>have taught us a lot about how memory</p>
<p>and other aspects of the brain work.</p>
<p>HM really teaches us that what we know</p>
<p>and what we are able to do</p>
<p>is the consequence of things that we are aware of</p>
<p>and learnings that have been passed off</p>
<p>into subconscious knowledge that our body knows,</p>
<p>our brain knows,</p>
<p>but we don&rsquo;t know exactly how we know that thing.</p>
<p>And I tell you the story about HM&rsquo;s ability</p>
<p>to understand a joke,</p>
<p>but that with repeated telling of a joke,</p>
<p>it has less and less and less of an impact</p>
<p>in creating a sense of laughter, of humor in HM,</p>
<p>not as just an anecdote to flesh out his story,</p>
<p>but because emotion itself</p>
<p>turns out to be the way in which we can enhance memories,</p>
<p>even if those are memories for things that are not funny,</p>
<p>are not intensely sad, are not immensely happy,</p>
<p>or don&rsquo;t evoke a really strong emotional response</p>
<p>or even any emotional response.</p>
<p>And the reason for that is that emotions,</p>
<p>just like perception, just like sensation,</p>
<p>are the consequence of particular neurochemicals</p>
<p>being present in our brain and body.</p>
<p>And as I&rsquo;m going to tell you next,</p>
<p>there are particular neurochemicals that you can leverage</p>
<p>in order to learn specific information faster</p>
<p>and to remember it for a much longer period of time,</p>
<p>maybe even forever.</p>
<p>And you can do that by leveraging the relationship</p>
<p>in your nervous system between your brain and your body</p>
<p>and your body back to your brain.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about tools for enhancing memory.</p>
<p>Now there&rsquo;s one tool that is absolutely clear, works.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s always worked, it works now,</p>
<p>and it will work forever.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s repetition.</p>
<p>The more often that you perform something</p>
<p>or that you recite something,</p>
<p>the more likely you are to remember it in the future.</p>
<p>And while that might seem obvious,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s worth thinking about what&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>when you repeat something.</p>
<p>But when I say what&rsquo;s happening,</p>
<p>I mean, at the neural level.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s happening is that you&rsquo;re encouraging</p>
<p>the firing of particular chains of neurons</p>
<p>that reside in a particular circuit, right?</p>
<p>So a particular sequence of neurons playing neuron A, B, C,</p>
<p>D played in that particular sequence</p>
<p>over and over and over again.</p>
<p>And with more repetitions,</p>
<p>you get more strengthening of those nerve connections.</p>
<p>Now, repetition works,</p>
<p>but the problem for most people</p>
<p>is that they either don&rsquo;t have the patience,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t have the time,</p>
<p>and sometimes they literally don&rsquo;t have the time</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;ve got a deadline</p>
<p>on something that they&rsquo;re trying to remember and learn,</p>
<p>or they simply would like to be able</p>
<p>to remember things better in general,</p>
<p>remember them more quickly.</p>
<p>This process of accelerating repetition-based learning</p>
<p>so that your learning curve doesn&rsquo;t go</p>
<p>from having to perform something 1,000 times,</p>
<p>and then gradually over time,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s 1,750 times a day, 500 times a day,</p>
<p>300 times a day, and down to no repetitions, right?</p>
<p>You can just perform that thing</p>
<p>the first time and every time.</p>
<p>Well, there is a way to shift that curve</p>
<p>so that you can essentially establish stronger connections</p>
<p>between the neurons that are involved</p>
<p>in generating that memory or behavior more quickly.</p>
<p>How do you do that?</p>
<p>Well, in order to answer that,</p>
<p>we have to look at the beautiful work</p>
<p>of James McGaw and Larry Cahill.</p>
<p>James McGaw and Larry Cahill did a number of experiments</p>
<p>over several decades, really,</p>
<p>based on a lot of animal literature,</p>
<p>but mainly focused on humans</p>
<p>that really established what&rsquo;s required</p>
<p>to get better at remembering things</p>
<p>and to do so very quickly.</p>
<p>I want to talk about one experiment that they did</p>
<p>that was particularly important.</p>
<p>And we will provide a link to this paper.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s some years old now, but the results still hold up.</p>
<p>In fact, the results establish an entire field</p>
<p>of memory in neuroscience and psychology.</p>
<p>What they did is they had human subjects</p>
<p>come into the laboratory and to read a short paragraph</p>
<p>of about 12 sentences.</p>
<p>And the key thing is that some subjects read a paragraph</p>
<p>that was pretty mundane.</p>
<p>The content, the information within the paragraph</p>
<p>was all related to the content of the previous sentence.</p>
<p>So it was a cogent paragraph, right?</p>
<p>It just wasn&rsquo;t meaningless scramble of words,</p>
<p>but it described a kind of mundane set of circumstances.</p>
<p>Maybe it would be a story about someone</p>
<p>who walked into a room, sat down at a desk,</p>
<p>wrote for a little bit, then got up and had lunch.</p>
<p>You know, just kind of mundane information,</p>
<p>not very interesting.</p>
<p>Another group of subjects read also a 12-sentence paragraph,</p>
<p>but that paragraph included a subset of sentences</p>
<p>that had a lot of emotionally intense language</p>
<p>or that had language that could evoke</p>
<p>an emotionally intense response in the person reading it.</p>
<p>So it might&rsquo;ve talked about a car accident</p>
<p>or a very intense surgery,</p>
<p>but it also could be positive stuff.</p>
<p>Things like a birthday party</p>
<p>or a celebration of some other kind or a big sports win.</p>
<p>So in other words, you have two conditions of this study.</p>
<p>People either read a boring paragraph</p>
<p>or they read a really emotionally laden paragraph.</p>
<p>And again, the emotions could either be positive</p>
<p>or negative emotions.</p>
<p>Subjects left the laboratory and sometime later,</p>
<p>they were called back to the laboratory.</p>
<p>And I should say at no point in the experiment</p>
<p>did they know they were part of a memory experiment, okay?</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t know why they&rsquo;re reading this paragraph.</p>
<p>They came in either for class credit or to get paid.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s typically how these things are done</p>
<p>on college campuses or elsewhere.</p>
<p>They come back into the lab and they would get a pop quiz.</p>
<p>They would be asked to recall the content</p>
<p>of the paragraph that they had read previously.</p>
<p>Now, as is probably expected, perhaps even obvious to you,</p>
<p>the subjects that read the emotionally intense paragraph</p>
<p>remembered far more of the content of that paragraph</p>
<p>and were far more accurate</p>
<p>in their remembering of that information.</p>
<p>Now, that particular finding wasn&rsquo;t very novel.</p>
<p>Many people had previously described</p>
<p>how emotionally intense events are better remembered</p>
<p>than non-emotionally intense events.</p>
<p>In fact, way back in the 1600s, Francis Bacon,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s largely credited</p>
<p>with developing the scientific method,</p>
<p>said, quote, memory is assisted by anything</p>
<p>that makes an impression on a powerful passion,</p>
<p>inspiring fear, for example, or wonder, shame, or joy.</p>
<p>Francis Bacon said that in 1620.</p>
<p>So Jim McGaugh and Larry Cahill</p>
<p>were certainly not the first to demonstrate</p>
<p>or to conceive of the idea</p>
<p>that emotionally laden experiences</p>
<p>are more easily remembered than other experiences.</p>
<p>However, what they did next was immensely important</p>
<p>for our understanding of memory</p>
<p>and for our building of tools to enhance learning and memory.</p>
<p>What they did was they evaluated the capacity for stress</p>
<p>and for particular neurochemicals associated with stress</p>
<p>to improve our ability to learn information,</p>
<p>not just information that is emotional,</p>
<p>but information of all kinds.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m going to describe some experiments</p>
<p>done in animal models just very briefly,</p>
<p>and then experiments done on human subjects,</p>
<p>because McGaugh worked mainly on animals,</p>
<p>also human subjects,</p>
<p>Larry Cahill almost exclusively on human subjects.</p>
<p>If you take a rat or a mouse and put it in an arena</p>
<p>where at one location, the animal receives</p>
<p>an electrical shock, and then you come back the next day,</p>
<p>you remove the shock evoking device</p>
<p>and you let the animal move around that arena,</p>
<p>that animal will quite understandably avoid the location</p>
<p>where it was shocked, so-called conditioned place aversion.</p>
<p>That effect of avoiding that particular location</p>
<p>occurs in one trial.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good example of one trial learning.</p>
<p>So somehow the animal knows</p>
<p>that it was shocked at that location.</p>
<p>It remembers that it is a hippocampal dependent learning.</p>
<p>So animals that lack a hippocampus</p>
<p>or who have their hippocampus pharmacologically</p>
<p>or otherwise incapacitated</p>
<p>will not learn that new bit of information,</p>
<p>but for animals that do,</p>
<p>they remember it after the first time and every time,</p>
<p>unless you are to block the release of certain chemicals</p>
<p>in the brain and body,</p>
<p>and the chemicals I&rsquo;m referring to</p>
<p>are epinephrine, adrenaline,</p>
<p>and to some extent, the corticosterones,</p>
<p>things like cortisol.</p>
<p>Now we know that the effect of getting one trial learning</p>
<p>somehow involves epinephrine,</p>
<p>at least in this particular experimental scenario,</p>
<p>because if researchers do the exact same experiment,</p>
<p>and they have done the exact same experiment,</p>
<p>but they introduce a pharmacological blocker of epinephrine</p>
<p>so that epinephrine is released in response to the shock,</p>
<p>but it cannot actually bind to its receptors</p>
<p>and have all of its biological effects,</p>
<p>well, then the animal is perfectly happy</p>
<p>to tread back into the area where it received the shock.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost as if it didn&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>or we have to assume that it didn&rsquo;t remember</p>
<p>that it received the shock at that location.</p>
<p>So it all seems pretty obvious when you hear it,</p>
<p>something bad happens in a location,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t go back to that location.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s conditioned place avoidance,</p>
<p>but it turns out that the opposite is also true,</p>
<p>meaning for something called conditioned place preference,</p>
<p>you can take an animal, put it into an arena,</p>
<p>feed it or reward it somehow at one location in that arena.</p>
<p>So you can give a hungry rat or mouse food</p>
<p>at one particular location,</p>
<p>take the animal out, come back the next day,</p>
<p>no food is introduced,</p>
<p>but it will go back to the location</p>
<p>where it received the food,</p>
<p>or you can do any variant of this.</p>
<p>You can make the arena a little bit chilly</p>
<p>and provide warmth at that location,</p>
<p>or you can take a male animal,</p>
<p>it turns out male rats and mice will mate at any point</p>
<p>or a female animal that&rsquo;s at the particular</p>
<p>so-called receptive phase of her mating cycle</p>
<p>and give them an opportunity to mate at a given location,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll go back to that location and wait and wait.</p>
<p>This is perhaps why people go back to the same bar</p>
<p>or the bar seat at the bar or the same restaurant</p>
<p>and wait because of the one time they,</p>
<p>things worked out for them, whatever the context was.</p>
<p>Conditioned place preference.</p>
<p>Conditioned place preference</p>
<p>as with conditioned place avoidance</p>
<p>depends on the release of adrenaline, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just about stress,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s about a heightened emotional state</p>
<p>in the brain and body.</p>
<p>Okay, this is really important.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just about stress.</p>
<p>You can get one trial learning for positive events,</p>
<p>conditioned place preference,</p>
<p>and you can get one trial learning for negative events.</p>
<p>Here, I say positive, negative,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m putting what&rsquo;s called valence on,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m making a value judgment about whether or not</p>
<p>the animal liked it or didn&rsquo;t like it,</p>
<p>and we have to presume what the animal liked or didn&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>and how it felt,</p>
<p>but this turns out all to be true for humans as well.</p>
<p>We know that because McGaugh and Cahill did experiments</p>
<p>where they gave people a boring paragraph to read</p>
<p>and only a boring paragraph to read,</p>
<p>but one group of subjects was asked to read the paragraph</p>
<p>and then to place their arm into very, very cold water.</p>
<p>In fact, it was ice water.</p>
<p>We know that placing one&rsquo;s arm into ice water,</p>
<p>especially if it&rsquo;s up to the shoulder or near to it,</p>
<p>evokes the release of adrenaline in the body.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not an enormous release,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a significant increase.</p>
<p>And yes, they measured adrenaline release.</p>
<p>In some cases, they also measured</p>
<p>for things like cortisol, et cetera.</p>
<p>And what they found is that if one evokes the release</p>
<p>of adrenaline through this arm into ice water approach,</p>
<p>the information that they read previously,</p>
<p>just a few minutes before, was remembered.</p>
<p>It was retained as well as emotionally intense information.</p>
<p>But keep in mind that information that they read</p>
<p>was not interesting at all,</p>
<p>or at least it wasn&rsquo;t emotionally laden.</p>
<p>This had to be the effect of adrenaline released</p>
<p>into the brain and body,</p>
<p>because if they blocked the release</p>
<p>or the function of adrenaline in the brain and or body,</p>
<p>they could block this effect.</p>
<p>Now, the biology of epinephrine and cortisol</p>
<p>are a little bit complex,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s some nuance there that&rsquo;s actually interesting</p>
<p>and important to us.</p>
<p>First of all, adrenaline is released in the body</p>
<p>and in the brain.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s released in the body from the adrenals.</p>
<p>Remember, epinephrine and adrenaline are the same thing.</p>
<p>Cortisol is also released from the adrenal glands,</p>
<p>these two little glands that ride atop our kidneys,</p>
<p>but it can&rsquo;t cross into the brain.</p>
<p>It only has what we call peripheral effects,</p>
<p>quickening of the heart rate, right?</p>
<p>Changes the patterns of blood flow,</p>
<p>changes our patterns of breathing,</p>
<p>in general makes our breathing more shallow and faster,</p>
<p>in general makes our heartbeat more quickly, et cetera.</p>
<p>Within our brain, we have a little brain area</p>
<p>called locus coeruleus, which is in the back of the brain,</p>
<p>which has the opportunity to sprinkler the rest of the brain</p>
<p>with the neuromodulator epinephrine, adrenaline,</p>
<p>as well as norepinephrine, a related neuromodulator,</p>
<p>and to essentially wake up or create a state of alertness</p>
<p>throughout the brain.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a very general effect.</p>
<p>The reason we have two sites of release</p>
<p>is because these neurochemicals</p>
<p>do not cross the blood-brain barrier.</p>
<p>And so waking up the body with adrenaline</p>
<p>and waking up the brain are two separate</p>
<p>so-called parallel phenomena.</p>
<p>Cortisol can cross the blood-brain barrier</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s lipophilic,</p>
<p>meaning it can move through fatty tissue.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll get into the biology of that in another episode,</p>
<p>but cortisol in general is released</p>
<p>and has much longer-term effects.</p>
<p>And as I&rsquo;ve just told you,</p>
<p>can permeate throughout the brain and body.</p>
<p>Adrenaline has more local effects</p>
<p>or at least is segregated between the brain and the body.</p>
<p>This will turn out to be important later.</p>
<p>The important thing to keep in mind</p>
<p>is that it is the emotionality evoked by an experience,</p>
<p>or to be more precise,</p>
<p>it is the emotional state that you&rsquo;re in</p>
<p>after you experience something</p>
<p>that dictates whether or not</p>
<p>you will learn it quickly or not.</p>
<p>This is absolutely important</p>
<p>in terms of thinking about tools to improve your memory.</p>
<p>And no, I am not going to suggest</p>
<p>that every time you want to learn something,</p>
<p>you plunge your arm into ice water.</p>
<p>Why won&rsquo;t I suggest that?</p>
<p>Well, it will induce the release of adrenaline,</p>
<p>but there are better ways to get that adrenaline release.</p>
<p>Before I explain exactly what those tools are,</p>
<p>I want to tamp down the biology of how all this works,</p>
<p>because in that understanding,</p>
<p>you will have access to the best possible tools</p>
<p>to improve your memory.</p>
<p>First of all, McGaugh and Cahill</p>
<p>were excellent experimentalists.</p>
<p>They did not just establish</p>
<p>that you could quicken the formation of a memory</p>
<p>by accessing material that was very emotionally laden</p>
<p>or creating an emotional high adrenaline state</p>
<p>after interacting with some thing,</p>
<p>some word, some person, some information.</p>
<p>They also tested whether or not</p>
<p>that whole effect could be blocked</p>
<p>by blocking the emotional state</p>
<p>or by blocking adrenaline.</p>
<p>So what they did is they had people read paragraphs</p>
<p>that either had a lot of emotional content,</p>
<p>or they had people read paragraphs that were pretty boring,</p>
<p>but then had them put their arm into ice water.</p>
<p>And I should say they did other experiments too</p>
<p>to increase adrenaline.</p>
<p>There were even some shock experiments</p>
<p>that were done by other groups.</p>
<p>Any number of things to evoke the release of adrenaline,</p>
<p>even people taking drugs that increase adrenaline.</p>
<p>But then they also did what are called blocking experiments.</p>
<p>They did experiments where they had people</p>
<p>get into a highly emotional state</p>
<p>from reading highly emotional material,</p>
<p>or they got people to get into</p>
<p>a highly emotional neurochemical state</p>
<p>by reading boring material</p>
<p>and then taking a drug to increase adrenaline</p>
<p>or ice bath or a shock.</p>
<p>And then they also administered a drug</p>
<p>called a beta blocker</p>
<p>to block the effect of adrenaline</p>
<p>and related chemicals in the brain and body.</p>
<p>And what they found is that even if people</p>
<p>were exposed to something really emotional</p>
<p>or had a lot of adrenaline in their system</p>
<p>because they received a drug</p>
<p>to increase the amount of adrenaline,</p>
<p>two manipulations that normally would increase memory,</p>
<p>keep that in mind.</p>
<p>If they gave them a beta blocker,</p>
<p>which reduced the response to that adrenaline, right?</p>
<p>So no quickening of the heart rate,</p>
<p>no quickening of the breathing,</p>
<p>no increase in the activity of locus coeruleus</p>
<p>and these kind of wake up signals to the rest of the brain.</p>
<p>Well, then the material wasn&rsquo;t remembered better at all.</p>
<p>What this tells us is that, yes, Francis Bacon was right.</p>
<p>McGaw and Cahill were right.</p>
<p>Hundreds, if not thousands of philosophers and psychologists</p>
<p>and neuroscientists were right</p>
<p>in stating and in thinking that high emotional states</p>
<p>help you learn things.</p>
<p>But what McGaw and Cahill really showed</p>
<p>and what&rsquo;s most important to know</p>
<p>is that it is the presence of high adrenaline,</p>
<p>high amounts of norepinephrine and epinephrine</p>
<p>and perhaps cortisol as well, as you&rsquo;ll soon see,</p>
<p>that allows a memory to be stamped down quickly.</p>
<p>It is not the emotion.</p>
<p>It is the neurochemical state that you go into</p>
<p>as a consequence of the emotion.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s very important to understand</p>
<p>that while those two things are related,</p>
<p>they are not one in the same thing.</p>
<p>Because what that means is that were you to evoke</p>
<p>the release of epinephrine, norepinephrine and cortisol,</p>
<p>or even just one or two of those chemicals,</p>
<p>after experiencing something,</p>
<p>you are stamping down the experience</p>
<p>that you just previously had.</p>
<p>Now, this is fundamentally important</p>
<p>and far and away different than the idea</p>
<p>that we remember things because they&rsquo;re important to us</p>
<p>or because they evoke emotion.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true, but the real reason,</p>
<p>the neurochemical reason, the mechanism behind all that</p>
<p>is these neurochemicals have the ability</p>
<p>to strengthen neural connections</p>
<p>by making them active just once.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something truly magic</p>
<p>about that neurochemical cocktail</p>
<p>that removes the need for repetition.</p>
<p>Okay, so let&rsquo;s apply this knowledge.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s establish a scientifically grounded set of tools,</p>
<p>meaning tools that take into account</p>
<p>the identity of the neurochemicals</p>
<p>that are important for enhancing learning</p>
<p>and the timing of the release of those chemicals</p>
<p>in order to enhance learning.</p>
<p>When I first learned about the results of McGaugh and Cahill</p>
<p>I was just blown away.</p>
<p>I was also pretty upset, but not with them.</p>
<p>I was upset with myself because I realized</p>
<p>that the way that I&rsquo;d been approaching learning and memory</p>
<p>was not optimal.</p>
<p>In fact, it was probably in the opposite direction</p>
<p>to the enhanced protocol for learning and memory</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m going to teach you today.</p>
<p>My typical mode of trying to learn something</p>
<p>while I was in college or while I was in graduate school</p>
<p>or as a junior professor or even a tenured professor</p>
<p>was to sit down to whatever it is I was going to try</p>
<p>and learn, perhaps even memorize,</p>
<p>or if it was a physical skill,</p>
<p>move to whatever environment I was going to learn</p>
<p>that physical skill in.</p>
<p>And prior to that, to make sure that I was hydrated,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s important to me</p>
<p>and certainly can contribute to your brain&rsquo;s ability</p>
<p>to function and your body&rsquo;s ability to function</p>
<p>and general patterns of alertness, but also to caffeinate.</p>
<p>I would have a nice strong cup of coffee or espresso.</p>
<p>I would have a nice strong cup of yerba mate.</p>
<p>And I still drink coffee or yerba mate very regularly.</p>
<p>I drink them in moderation, I think, certainly for me,</p>
<p>but typically I would drink those things</p>
<p>before I would engage in any kind of attempt</p>
<p>to learn or memorize or to acquire a new skill.</p>
<p>Now, caffeine in the form of coffee or yerba mate</p>
<p>or any other form of caffeine</p>
<p>does create a sense of alertness in our brain and body.</p>
<p>And it does that through two major mechanisms.</p>
<p>The first mechanism is by blocking the effects of adenosine.</p>
<p>Adenosine is a molecule that builds up in the brain and body</p>
<p>the longer that we are awake.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s largely what&rsquo;s responsible</p>
<p>for our feelings of sleepiness and fatigue</p>
<p>when we&rsquo;ve been awake for a very long time.</p>
<p>Caffeine essentially acts to block the effects of adenosine.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a competing agonist, not to get technical,</p>
<p>but it binds to the receptor for adenosine</p>
<p>for some period of time and prevents adenosine</p>
<p>from having its normal pattern of action</p>
<p>and thereby reduces our feelings of fatigue.</p>
<p>But it also increases state of alertness.</p>
<p>So while it&rsquo;s reducing fatigue,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s also pushing on neurochemical systems</p>
<p>in order to directly increase our alertness.</p>
<p>And it does that in large part</p>
<p>by increasing the transmission of epinephrine,</p>
<p>adrenaline in the brain and body.</p>
<p>It also has this interesting effect</p>
<p>of upregulating the number and or efficiency,</p>
<p>or we say the efficacy of dopamine receptors,</p>
<p>such that when dopamine is present</p>
<p>and as a molecule that increases motivation</p>
<p>and craving and pursuit,</p>
<p>that dopamine can have a more potent effect</p>
<p>than it would otherwise.</p>
<p>So caffeine really hits these three systems.</p>
<p>It hits other systems too,</p>
<p>but it mainly reduces fatigue by reducing adenosine,</p>
<p>increases alertness by increasing epinephrine release</p>
<p>or adrenaline release,</p>
<p>I should say both from the adrenals in your body</p>
<p>and from locus coeruleus within the brain.</p>
<p>And it can, in parallel to all that,</p>
<p>increase the action or the efficacy</p>
<p>of the action of dopamine.</p>
<p>So my typical way of approaching learning and memory</p>
<p>would be to drink some caffeine</p>
<p>and then focus really hard on whatever it is</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m trying to learn,</p>
<p>try and eliminate distractions,</p>
<p>and then hope, hope, hope,</p>
<p>or try, try, try to remember that information</p>
<p>as best as I could.</p>
<p>And frankly, I felt like it was working pretty well for me.</p>
<p>And typically, if I leveraged other forms of pharmacology</p>
<p>in order to enhance learning and memory,</p>
<p>things like alpha-GPC or phosphatidylserine,</p>
<p>I would do that by taking those things</p>
<p>before I sat down to learn a particular set of information</p>
<p>or before I went off to learn a particular physical skill.</p>
<p>Now, for those of you out there listening to this,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re probably thinking, well, okay,</p>
<p>the results of McGaugh and Cahill pointed to the fact</p>
<p>that having adrenaline released after learning something</p>
<p>enhanced learning of that thing.</p>
<p>But a lot of these things like caffeine or alpha-GPC</p>
<p>can increase epinephrine and adrenaline or dopamine</p>
<p>or other molecules in the brain and body</p>
<p>that can enhance memory for a long period of time.</p>
<p>So it makes sense to take it first or even during learning</p>
<p>and then allow that increase to occur.</p>
<p>And the increase will occur over a long period of time</p>
<p>and will enhance learning and memory.</p>
<p>And while that is partially true, it is not entirely true.</p>
<p>And it turns out it&rsquo;s not optimal.</p>
<p>Work that was done by the McGaugh Laboratory</p>
<p>and other laboratories evaluated</p>
<p>the precise temporal relationship</p>
<p>between neurochemical activation of these pathways</p>
<p>and learning and memory.</p>
<p>And what they did is they had animals and or people,</p>
<p>depending on the experiment, take a drug, could be caffeine,</p>
<p>could be in pill form,</p>
<p>something that would increase adrenaline</p>
<p>or related molecules that create this state of alertness</p>
<p>that are related to emotionality.</p>
<p>And they had them do it either an hour before,</p>
<p>30 minutes before, 10 minutes before,</p>
<p>five minutes before learning</p>
<p>or during the bout of learning, right?</p>
<p>The reading of the information</p>
<p>or the performing of the skill that one is trying to learn</p>
<p>or five minutes, 10 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes,</p>
<p>et cetera, afterwards.</p>
<p>So they looked very precisely at when exactly is best</p>
<p>to evoke this adrenaline release.</p>
<p>And it turns out that the best time window</p>
<p>to evoke the release of these chemicals,</p>
<p>if the goal is to enhance learning and memory</p>
<p>of the material, is either immediately after</p>
<p>or just a few minutes, five, 10, maybe 15 minutes</p>
<p>after you&rsquo;re repeating that information.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re trying to learn that information.</p>
<p>Again, this could be cognitive information</p>
<p>or this could be a physical skill.</p>
<p>Now, this really spits in the face of the way</p>
<p>that most of us approach learning and memory.</p>
<p>Most of us, if we use stimulants like caffeine</p>
<p>or alpha-GPC, we&rsquo;re taking those before</p>
<p>or during an attempt to learn, not afterwards.</p>
<p>These results point to the fact</p>
<p>that it is after the learning and memory</p>
<p>that you really want to get that big increase</p>
<p>in epinephrine and the related molecules</p>
<p>that will tamp down memory.</p>
<p>So what this means is that if you are currently using</p>
<p>caffeine or other compounds, and we&rsquo;ll talk about</p>
<p>what those are and safety issues and so forth in a moment,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re using those compounds in order</p>
<p>to enhance learning and memory by taking them before</p>
<p>or during a learning episode, well, then I encourage you</p>
<p>to try and take them either late in the learning episode</p>
<p>or immediately after the learning episode.</p>
<p>Now, given everything I&rsquo;ve told you up until now,</p>
<p>why would I say late in the learning episode</p>
<p>or immediately after?</p>
<p>Well, when you ingest something by drinking it</p>
<p>or you take it in capsule form, there&rsquo;s a period of time</p>
<p>before that gets absorbed into the body.</p>
<p>And different substances, such as caffeine,</p>
<p>alpha-GPC, et cetera, are absorbed in from the gut</p>
<p>and into the bloodstream and reach the brain</p>
<p>and trigger these effects in the brain and body</p>
<p>at different rates.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not instantaneous.</p>
<p>Some have effects within minutes,</p>
<p>others within tens of minutes and so on.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really going to depend on the pharmacology</p>
<p>of those things, and it&rsquo;s also going to depend</p>
<p>on whether or not you have food in your gut,</p>
<p>what else you happen to have circulating</p>
<p>in your bloodstream, et cetera.</p>
<p>But at a very basic level, we can confidently say</p>
<p>that there are not one, not dozens,</p>
<p>but as I mentioned before, hundreds of studies in animals</p>
<p>and in humans that point to the fact</p>
<p>that triggering the increase of adrenaline late in learning</p>
<p>or immediately after learning is going to be most beneficial</p>
<p>if your goal is to retain that information</p>
<p>for some period of time and to reduce the number</p>
<p>of repetitions required in order to learn that information.</p>
<p>Now, I want to acknowledge that on previous episodes</p>
<p>of this podcast and in appearing on other podcasts,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked a lot about things like non-sleep deep rest</p>
<p>and naps and sleep as vital to the learning process.</p>
<p>And I want to emphasize that none</p>
<p>of that information has changed, right?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t look at any of that information differently</p>
<p>as the consequence of what I&rsquo;m talking about today.</p>
<p>It is still true that the strengthening of connections</p>
<p>in the brain, the literal neuroplasticity,</p>
<p>the changing of the circuits occurs during deep sleep</p>
<p>and non-sleep deep rest.</p>
<p>And it is also true,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve mentioned these results earlier,</p>
<p>that two papers were published in Cell Reports,</p>
<p>Cell Press Journal, excellent journal</p>
<p>over the last few years showing that brief naps</p>
<p>of about 20 to up to 90 minutes in some period of time</p>
<p>after an attempt to learn can enhance the rate</p>
<p>of learning and memory.</p>
<p>However, those bouts of sleep, the deep sleep that night,</p>
<p>I should say, or those brief naps,</p>
<p>or even the so-called NSDR, as we call it,</p>
<p>non-sleep deep rest that was used to enhance the learning</p>
<p>and memory of particular pieces of information,</p>
<p>either cognitive or physical information or both,</p>
<p>that still can be performed,</p>
<p>but it can be performed some hours later,</p>
<p>even an hour later.</p>
<p>It can be performed two hours later or four hours later.</p>
<p>Remember, it&rsquo;s in these naps and in deep sleep</p>
<p>that the actual reconfiguration</p>
<p>of the neural circuits occurs,</p>
<p>the strengthening of those neural circuits occurs.</p>
<p>It is not the case that you need to finish a bout</p>
<p>of learning and drop immediately into a nap or sleep.</p>
<p>Some people might do that,</p>
<p>but if you&rsquo;re really trying to optimize and enhance</p>
<p>and improve your memory, the data from McGaugh and Cahill</p>
<p>and many other laboratories that stemmed out</p>
<p>from their initial work really point to the fact</p>
<p>that the ideal protocol would be focus on the thing</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re trying to learn very intensely.</p>
<p>There are also some other things like error rates, et cetera.</p>
<p>Please see our episodes on learning.</p>
<p>We have a newsletter on how to learn better.</p>
<p>You can access that at hubermanlab.com.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a zero cost newsletter.</p>
<p>You can grab that PDF.</p>
<p>It lists out the things to do during the learning bout.</p>
<p>Still try and get excellent sleep.</p>
<p>Again, fundamentally important for mental health,</p>
<p>physical health, and performance.</p>
<p>And we can now extend from performance to saying,</p>
<p>including learning and memory.</p>
<p>Nap, if it doesn&rsquo;t interrupt your nighttime sleep,</p>
<p>naps of anywhere from 10 to 90 minutes</p>
<p>or non-sleep deep rest protocols</p>
<p>will enhance learning and memory.</p>
<p>But we can now add to that, that spiking adrenaline,</p>
<p>provided it can be done in a safe way,</p>
<p>is going to reduce the number of repetitions</p>
<p>required to learn.</p>
<p>And that should be done at the very tail end</p>
<p>or immediately after a learning bout,</p>
<p>which is compatible with all the other protocols</p>
<p>that I mentioned.</p>
<p>And the reason I&rsquo;m revisiting the stuff about sleep</p>
<p>and non-sleep deep rest,</p>
<p>is I think that some people got the impression</p>
<p>that they need to do that immediately after learning.</p>
<p>And today I&rsquo;m saying to the contrary,</p>
<p>immediately after learning,</p>
<p>you need to go into a heightened state</p>
<p>of emotionality and alertness.</p>
<p>Now, it&rsquo;s vitally important to point out</p>
<p>that you do not need pharmacology.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need caffeine.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need alpha-GPC.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need any pharmacologic substance</p>
<p>to spike adrenaline,</p>
<p>unless that&rsquo;s something that you already are doing</p>
<p>or that you can do safely</p>
<p>or that you know that you can do safely.</p>
<p>And I always say, and I&rsquo;ll say it again,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a physician, so I&rsquo;m not prescribing anything.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a professor, so I profess things.</p>
<p>You need to do what&rsquo;s safe for you.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re somebody who&rsquo;s not used to drinking caffeine</p>
<p>and you suddenly drink four espresso</p>
<p>after trying to learn something,</p>
<p>you are going to have a severe increase in alertness</p>
<p>and probably even anxiety.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re panic attack prone,</p>
<p>please don&rsquo;t start taking stimulants</p>
<p>in order to learn things better.</p>
<p>Please be safe.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t just say that to protect me.</p>
<p>I say that to protect you.</p>
<p>And I should mention that if you&rsquo;re not accustomed</p>
<p>to taking something,</p>
<p>you always want to first check with your doctor, of course,</p>
<p>but also move into that gradually, right?</p>
<p>Start with the lowest effective dose,</p>
<p>the minimal effective dose.</p>
<p>And sometimes the minimal effective dose is zero milligrams.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s nothing.</p>
<p>Why do I say that?</p>
<p>Well, we already talked about results</p>
<p>where they put people&rsquo;s arms into an ice bath</p>
<p>in order to evoke adrenaline release.</p>
<p>You are welcome to do that if you want.</p>
<p>In fact, that&rsquo;s a pretty low cost, zero pharmacology,</p>
<p>at least exogenous pharmacology way</p>
<p>to approach this whole thing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a way of evoking your own natural epinephrine.</p>
<p>And it turns out also dopamine release.</p>
<p>You could take a cold shower.</p>
<p>You could do an ice bath</p>
<p>or get into a cold circulating bath.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve done several episodes</p>
<p>on the utility of cold for health and performance.</p>
<p>You can find those episodes at hubrunlab.com.</p>
<p>Also the episode with my colleague at Stanford</p>
<p>from the biology department, Dr. Craig Heller.</p>
<p>Lots of protocols in particular in the episode</p>
<p>on cold for health and performance</p>
<p>that describe how best to use the cold shower</p>
<p>or the ice bath or the circulating cold bath</p>
<p>in order to evoke epinephrine and dopamine release.</p>
<p>The point is that the time in which you would want</p>
<p>to do those protocols is after,</p>
<p>ideally immediately after you&rsquo;re learning about,</p>
<p>meaning when you&rsquo;re sitting down to learn new information</p>
<p>or after trying to learn some new physical skill.</p>
<p>Now, whether or not that&rsquo;s compatible</p>
<p>with the other reasons you&rsquo;re doing deliberate cold exposure</p>
<p>and whether or not that&rsquo;s compatible</p>
<p>with the other things you&rsquo;re doing,</p>
<p>that depends on the contour of your lifestyle,</p>
<p>your training, your academic goals,</p>
<p>your learning goals, et cetera.</p>
<p>But if your specific purpose is to enhance learning</p>
<p>and memory, you want to spike adrenaline afterwards.</p>
<p>And so what I&rsquo;m telling you is you can do that with caffeine.</p>
<p>You can do that with alpha GPC.</p>
<p>You can do that with a combination of caffeine</p>
<p>and alpha GPC if you can do that safely.</p>
<p>Some of you I know are using other forms of pharmacology.</p>
<p>I did a long episode all about ADHD.</p>
<p>I have to just really declare my stance very clearly</p>
<p>that I am not a fan.</p>
<p>I am actually opposed to people using prescription drugs</p>
<p>who are not prescribed those drugs, right,</p>
<p>in order to enhance alertness.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a big addictive potential.</p>
<p>There also is a potential to really disrupt</p>
<p>one&rsquo;s own pharmacology around the dopaminergic system.</p>
<p>However, some of you I know are prescribed things</p>
<p>like ritalin, Adderall, and modafinil</p>
<p>and things of that sort</p>
<p>in order to increase alertness and focus.</p>
<p>So for those of you that are prescribed those things</p>
<p>from a board-certified physician,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to have to decide</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re going to take them before trying to learn</p>
<p>or after trying to learn.</p>
<p>You also have to take into consideration</p>
<p>that some of those drugs are very long-acting,</p>
<p>some are shorter-acting,</p>
<p>and time that according to what you&rsquo;re trying to learn</p>
<p>and when.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s pharmacology.</p>
<p>But as I&rsquo;ve mentioned, there are the behavioral protocols.</p>
<p>You can use cold, and cold is an excellent stimulus</p>
<p>because, first of all, it doesn&rsquo;t involve pharmacology.</p>
<p>Second of all, you can generally access it</p>
<p>at low to zero cost, especially the cold shower approach.</p>
<p>And third, you can titrate it.</p>
<p>You can start with warmer water.</p>
<p>You can make it very, very cold if that&rsquo;s your thing,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re able to tolerate that safely.</p>
<p>You can make it moderately cold.</p>
<p>How cold should it be in order to evoke adrenaline release?</p>
<p>Well, it should be uncomfortably cold,</p>
<p>but cold enough that you feel like</p>
<p>you really want to get out, but can stay in safely.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s going to evoke adrenaline release.</p>
<p>If it quickens your breathing,</p>
<p>if it makes you go wide-eyed,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s increasing adrenaline release.</p>
<p>In fact, those effects of going wide-eyed</p>
<p>and quickening of the breathing</p>
<p>and the challenges in thinking clearly,</p>
<p>those are the direct effects of adrenaline</p>
<p>on your brain and body.</p>
<p>And of course, there are other ways to increase adrenaline.</p>
<p>You could go out for a hard run.</p>
<p>You could do any number of things</p>
<p>that would increase adrenaline in your body.</p>
<p>Which things you choose is up to you.</p>
<p>But from a very clear, solid grounding in research data,</p>
<p>we can confidently say that spiking adrenaline</p>
<p>after interacting with some material,</p>
<p>physical or cognitive material that you&rsquo;re trying to learn</p>
<p>is going to be the best time to spike that adrenaline.</p>
<p>Now, I realize that I&rsquo;m being a bit redundant today,</p>
<p>or perhaps a lot redundant in repeating over and over</p>
<p>that the increase in epinephrine should occur</p>
<p>either very late in an attempt to learn something</p>
<p>or immediately after an attempt to learn something.</p>
<p>I also want to emphasize the general contour</p>
<p>of pharmacologic effects and of behavioral tools</p>
<p>to create adrenaline.</p>
<p>What do I mean by that sentence?</p>
<p>What I mean is that McGaugh and colleagues</p>
<p>explored a huge number of different compounds and approaches,</p>
<p>everything from the hand into the ice bath</p>
<p>to injecting adrenaline, to caffeine,</p>
<p>to drugs that block the effects of adrenaline and caffeine,</p>
<p>drugs like mucimol and picrotoxin.</p>
<p>Please don&rsquo;t take those.</p>
<p>These are drugs that reduce</p>
<p>or enhance the amount of adrenaline.</p>
<p>And the overall takeaway</p>
<p>is that anything that increases adrenaline</p>
<p>will increase learning and memory</p>
<p>and will reduce the number of repetitions</p>
<p>required to learn something,</p>
<p>regardless of whether or not that something</p>
<p>has an emotional intensity or not,</p>
<p>provided that that spike in adrenaline</p>
<p>occurs late in the learning or immediately after.</p>
<p>And anything that reduces epinephrine and adrenaline</p>
<p>will impair learning.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the key and novel piece of information</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m adding now,</p>
<p>which is if you&rsquo;re taking beta blockers, for instance,</p>
<p>or if you&rsquo;re trying to learn something</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not evoking much of an emotional response</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re not using any pharmacology</p>
<p>or other methods to enhance adrenaline release</p>
<p>after learning that thing,</p>
<p>well, you&rsquo;re not going to learn it very well.</p>
<p>In fact, McGaugh and Cahill did beautiful experiments</p>
<p>in humans looking at how much adrenaline is increased</p>
<p>by varying the emotional intensity of different things</p>
<p>that they were trying to get people to learn,</p>
<p>or by changing the dosage of epinephrine,</p>
<p>or by changing the amount of epinephrine blocker</p>
<p>that they injected, lots and lots of studies.</p>
<p>The key thing to take away from those studies</p>
<p>is that for some people,</p>
<p>adrenaline was increased 600 to 700%.</p>
<p>So six to seven fold over baseline</p>
<p>in the amount of circulating epinephrine or adrenaline.</p>
<p>And keep in mind,</p>
<p>sometimes that increase was due to the actual thing</p>
<p>they were trying to learn being very emotional,</p>
<p>positive or negative emotion.</p>
<p>And sometimes it was because</p>
<p>they were using a pharmacologic approach</p>
<p>or the ice bath approach.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think they ever used a cold shower approach,</p>
<p>but that would have been a very effective one,</p>
<p>we can be sure.</p>
<p>However, other people had a zero to 10% increase,</p>
<p>so a very small increase in epinephrine.</p>
<p>What we can confidently say on the basis of all those data</p>
<p>is that the more epinephrine release,</p>
<p>the better that people remembered the material.</p>
<p>Over and over again, this was shown,</p>
<p>whether or not it was for cognitive material,</p>
<p>so learning a language, learning a passage of words,</p>
<p>learning mathematics,</p>
<p>or whether or not it was for physical learning.</p>
<p>I want to emphasize something about physical learning</p>
<p>because I know a number of you</p>
<p>are probably drinking a cup of coffee</p>
<p>or having a cup of yerba mate,</p>
<p>or maybe even an energy drink</p>
<p>and taking some alpha GPC or something</p>
<p>before physical exercise.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying that&rsquo;s a bad thing to do</p>
<p>or that you wouldn&rsquo;t want to do that,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s really to increase alertness.</p>
<p>It won&rsquo;t enhance learning,</p>
<p>at least not as well as doing those things</p>
<p>after the physical exercise.</p>
<p>Now, again, many of you, including myself,</p>
<p>exercise for sake of the physical benefits of that exercise,</p>
<p>so cardiovascular resistance training,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re not really focused on learning and memory.</p>
<p>So I emphasize this</p>
<p>just so it&rsquo;s immensely clear to everybody,</p>
<p>if you want to use those approaches of increasing adrenaline</p>
<p>prior to or during physical training,</p>
<p>or cognitive work for that matter, be my guest.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s perfectly fine, provided that&rsquo;s safe for you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s only by moving it to late or after the learning</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re really shifting the role</p>
<p>of that adrenaline increase</p>
<p>to enhancing memory specifically.</p>
<p>And as a cautionary note,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t think that you can push this entire system</p>
<p>to the extreme over and over again,</p>
<p>or chronically as we say, and get away with it.</p>
<p>In other words, you&rsquo;re not going to be able to take</p>
<p>a alpha GPC and a double espresso,</p>
<p>do your focus bout of work, cognitive or physical work,</p>
<p>and then spike adrenaline again afterwards</p>
<p>and remember that stuff even better, right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not encouraging you.</p>
<p>In fact, I&rsquo;m discouraging you</p>
<p>from chronically increasing adrenaline</p>
<p>both during and after a given bout of work</p>
<p>if the goal is to learn.</p>
<p>Why do I say that?</p>
<p>Well, work from McGaugh and Cahill and others</p>
<p>has shown that it&rsquo;s not the absolute amount of adrenaline</p>
<p>that you release in your brain and body</p>
<p>that matters for enhancing memory.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the amount of adrenaline that you release</p>
<p>relative to the amount of adrenaline</p>
<p>that was in your system just prior,</p>
<p>in particular in the hour or two prior.</p>
<p>So again, it&rsquo;s the delta, as we say, it&rsquo;s the difference.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re going to chronically increase adrenaline,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not going to learn as well.</p>
<p>The real key is to have adrenaline modestly low,</p>
<p>perhaps even just as much as you need</p>
<p>in order to be able to focus on something,</p>
<p>pay attention to it, and then spike it afterwards.</p>
<p>This is immensely important</p>
<p>because while much of what we&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>is actually a form of inducing</p>
<p>a neurochemical acute stress,</p>
<p>meaning a brief and rapid onset of stress,</p>
<p>well, chronic stress,</p>
<p>the chronic elevation of epinephrine and cortisol</p>
<p>is actually detrimental to learning.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s an entire category of literature,</p>
<p>mainly from the work of the great</p>
<p>and sadly the late Bruce McEwen</p>
<p>from the Rockefeller University</p>
<p>and some of his scientific offspring,</p>
<p>like the great Robert Sapolsky,</p>
<p>showing that chronic stress,</p>
<p>chronic elevation of epinephrine</p>
<p>actually inhibits learning and memory</p>
<p>and also can inhibit immune system function.</p>
<p>Whereas acute, right,</p>
<p>sharp increases in adrenaline and cortisol</p>
<p>actually can enhance learning</p>
<p>and indeed can enhance the immune system.</p>
<p>So if you really want to leverage this information,</p>
<p>you might consider getting your brain and body</p>
<p>into a very calm and yet alert state,</p>
<p>so a high attentional state</p>
<p>that will allow you to focus on</p>
<p>what it is that you&rsquo;re trying to learn.</p>
<p>We know focus is vital for encoding information</p>
<p>and for triggering neuroplasticity,</p>
<p>but remaining calm throughout that time</p>
<p>and then afterwards spiking adrenaline</p>
<p>and allowing adrenaline to have these incredible effects</p>
<p>on reducing the number of repetitions required to learn.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re like me,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re learning about this information,</p>
<p>this beautiful work of McGaugh and Cahill and others</p>
<p>and thinking, wow,</p>
<p>I should perhaps consider spiking my adrenaline</p>
<p>in one form or another at the tail end</p>
<p>or immediately following an attempt to learn something.</p>
<p>And yet we are not the first to have this conversation,</p>
<p>nor were McGaugh and Cahill</p>
<p>or any other researchers that I&rsquo;ve discussed today</p>
<p>the first to start using this technique.</p>
<p>In fact, there is a beautiful review</p>
<p>that was published just this year,</p>
<p>May of 2022 in the journal Neuron,</p>
<p>Cell Press Journal, excellent journal</p>
<p>called Mechanisms of Memory Under Stress.</p>
<p>And I just want to read to you</p>
<p>the first opening paragraph of this review,</p>
<p>which is as the name suggests,</p>
<p>all about memory and stress.</p>
<p>So here I&rsquo;m reading and I quote,</p>
<p>in medieval times communities threw young children</p>
<p>in the river when they wanted them</p>
<p>to remember important events.</p>
<p>They believe that throwing a child in the water</p>
<p>after witnessing historic proceedings</p>
<p>would leave a lifelong memory</p>
<p>for the events in the child.</p>
<p>Believe it or not, this is true.</p>
<p>This is a practice that somehow people arrived at.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if they were aware</p>
<p>of what adrenaline was probably not,</p>
<p>but somehow in medieval times,</p>
<p>it was understood that spiking adrenaline</p>
<p>or creating a robust emotional experience</p>
<p>after an experience that one hoped a child would learn</p>
<p>would encourage the child&rsquo;s nervous system.</p>
<p>And they even know what a nervous system was,</p>
<p>but would encourage the brain and body of that child</p>
<p>to remember those particular events.</p>
<p>Very counterintuitive if you ask me,</p>
<p>I would have thought that the kid would remember</p>
<p>only being thrown into the river.</p>
<p>My guess is that they remember that,</p>
<p>but that the idea here anyway</p>
<p>is that they also remember the things</p>
<p>that preceded being thrown into the river.</p>
<p>So both interesting and amusing</p>
<p>and somewhat I should say thought stimulating really</p>
<p>that this is a practice that has been going on</p>
<p>for many hundreds of years.</p>
<p>And we are not the first to start thinking</p>
<p>about using cold water as an adrenaline stimulus,</p>
<p>nor are we the first to start thinking</p>
<p>about using cold water induced adrenaline</p>
<p>as a way to enhance learning and memory.</p>
<p>This has been happening since medieval times.</p>
<p>So up until now, I&rsquo;ve been talking about</p>
<p>a pretty broad contour of these experiments.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been talking about the underlying pharmacology,</p>
<p>the role of epinephrine and so forth.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t really talked a lot</p>
<p>about the underlying neural mechanisms.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m just going to take a minute or two</p>
<p>and describe those for you because they are informative.</p>
<p>We all have a brain structure called the amygdala.</p>
<p>A lot of people think it&rsquo;s associated with fear,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s actually associated with threat detection</p>
<p>and more generally, and I should say more specifically</p>
<p>with detecting what sorts of events</p>
<p>in the environment are novel</p>
<p>and are linked to particular emotional states,</p>
<p>both positive emotional states</p>
<p>and negative emotional states.</p>
<p>So the neurons in the amygdala are exquisitely good</p>
<p>at figuring out, right, they don&rsquo;t have their own mind,</p>
<p>but at detecting correlations</p>
<p>between sensory events in the environment</p>
<p>that trigger the release of adrenaline</p>
<p>and what&rsquo;s going on in the brain.</p>
<p>And because the amygdala is so extensively interconnected</p>
<p>with other areas of the brain,</p>
<p>it basically connects to everything</p>
<p>and everything connects back to it.</p>
<p>The amygdala is in a position</p>
<p>to strengthen particular connections in the brain</p>
<p>very easily provided certain conditions are met.</p>
<p>And those conditions are the ones</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve been talking about up until now,</p>
<p>emotional saliency that results in increases</p>
<p>in epinephrine and cortisol</p>
<p>or circulating epinephrine and cortisol being much higher</p>
<p>than it was 10 minutes or 15 minutes before.</p>
<p>And the net effect of the amygdala in this context</p>
<p>is to take whatever patterns of neural activity</p>
<p>preceded that increase in adrenaline and corticosterone</p>
<p>and strengthen those synapses</p>
<p>that were involved in that neural activity.</p>
<p>So the amygdala doesn&rsquo;t have knowledge.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a thinking area.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a correlation detector</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s correlating neurochemical states</p>
<p>of the brain and body with different patterns</p>
<p>of electrical activity in the brain.</p>
<p>This is important because it really emphasizes the fact</p>
<p>that both negative and positive emotional states</p>
<p>and the different but somewhat overlapping chemical states</p>
<p>that they create are the conditions,</p>
<p>as we say, the AND gates through which memory is laid down.</p>
<p>AND gates will be familiar to those of you</p>
<p>who have done a bit of computer programming.</p>
<p>An AND gate is simply a condition</p>
<p>in which you need one thing and another to happen</p>
<p>in order for a third thing to happen.</p>
<p>So you need epinephrine elevated</p>
<p>and you need robust activity in a particular brain circuit</p>
<p>if in fact that brain circuit is going to be strengthened.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not sufficient to have one or the other.</p>
<p>You need both, hence the name AND gate.</p>
<p>And the amygdala is very good</p>
<p>at establishing these AND gate contingencies.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also a very generic brain structure</p>
<p>in the sense that it doesn&rsquo;t really care</p>
<p>what sorts of sensory events are involved</p>
<p>provided they correlated in time</p>
<p>with that increase in adrenaline and corticosterone.</p>
<p>This has a wonderful side and a kind of dark side.</p>
<p>The dark side is that PTSD and traumas of various kinds</p>
<p>often involve a increase in adrenaline</p>
<p>because whatever it was that caused the PTSD</p>
<p>was indeed very stressful,</p>
<p>caused these big increases in these chemicals.</p>
<p>And because the amygdala is rather general</p>
<p>in its functions, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not tuned or designed in any kind of way</p>
<p>to be specifically active in response</p>
<p>to particular types of sensory events or perceptions.</p>
<p>Well, then what it means is that we can start</p>
<p>to become afraid of entire city blocks</p>
<p>where one bad thing happened in a particular room</p>
<p>of a particular building in a city block.</p>
<p>We can become fearful of any place</p>
<p>that contains a lot of people</p>
<p>if something bad happened to us</p>
<p>in a place that contained a lot of people.</p>
<p>The amygdala is not so much of a splitter,</p>
<p>as we say in science.</p>
<p>We talk about lumpers and splitters.</p>
<p>Lumpers are kind of generalizers, if that&rsquo;s even a word.</p>
<p>And I think it is,</p>
<p>someone will tell me one way or the other.</p>
<p>And splitters are people that are ultra precise</p>
<p>and specific and nuanced about every little detail.</p>
<p>The amygdala is more of a lumper than a splitter</p>
<p>when it comes to sensory events.</p>
<p>Other areas of the brain only become active</p>
<p>under very, very specific conditions</p>
<p>and only those conditions.</p>
<p>And similarly, epinephrine is just a molecule.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a chemical that&rsquo;s circulating</p>
<p>in our brain and body.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no epinephrine specifically for a cold shower</p>
<p>that is distinct from the epinephrine</p>
<p>associated with a bad event,</p>
<p>which is distinct from the epinephrine</p>
<p>associated with a really exciting event</p>
<p>that makes you really alert.</p>
<p>Epinephrine is just a molecule, it&rsquo;s generic.</p>
<p>And so these systems have a lot of overlap.</p>
<p>And that can explain in large part</p>
<p>why when good things happen in particular locations</p>
<p>and in the company of particular people,</p>
<p>we often generalize to large categories</p>
<p>of people, places, and things.</p>
<p>And when negative things happen in particular circumstances,</p>
<p>we often generalize about people, places, and things</p>
<p>associated with that negative event.</p>
<p>So now I&rsquo;d like to talk about other tools</p>
<p>that you can leverage</p>
<p>that have been shown in quality peer-reviewed studies</p>
<p>to enhance learning and memory.</p>
<p>And perhaps one of the most potent of those tools</p>
<p>is exercise.</p>
<p>There are numerous studies on this in both animal models</p>
<p>and fortunately now also in humans,</p>
<p>thanks to the beautiful work of people like Wendy Suzuki</p>
<p>from New York University.</p>
<p>Wendy&rsquo;s lab has identified how exercise works</p>
<p>to enhance learning and memory</p>
<p>and other forms of cognition I should mention,</p>
<p>as well as things that can augment,</p>
<p>can enhance the effects of exercise on learning and memory</p>
<p>and other forms of cognition.</p>
<p>Wendy is going to be a guest on this podcast.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually the episode that follows this episode</p>
<p>and includes a lot of material</p>
<p>that we have not covered today.</p>
<p>And she&rsquo;s an incredible scientist</p>
<p>and has some incredible findings</p>
<p>that I know everyone is going to find immensely useful.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I want to talk about</p>
<p>some of the general effects of exercise</p>
<p>on learning and memory that she&rsquo;s discovered</p>
<p>and that other laboratories have discovered.</p>
<p>If you recall earlier,</p>
<p>I mentioned that learning and memory</p>
<p>almost always involves the strengthening</p>
<p>of particular synapses and neural circuits in the brain,</p>
<p>and not so much the increase</p>
<p>in the number of neurons in the brain.</p>
<p>There is one exception, however,</p>
<p>and we now have both animal data and some human data</p>
<p>to support the fact that cardiovascular exercise</p>
<p>seems to increase what we call dentate gyrus neurogenesis.</p>
<p>Neurogenesis is the creation of new neurons.</p>
<p>The dentate gyrus is a sub-region of the hippocampus</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s involved in learning and memory of particular kinds,</p>
<p>right, certain types of events,</p>
<p>in particular contextual learning,</p>
<p>but some other things as well,</p>
<p>sometimes involved in spatial learning.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of debate about</p>
<p>exactly what the dentate gyrus does,</p>
<p>but for sake of this discussion,</p>
<p>and I think everyone in the neuroscience community</p>
<p>would agree that the dentate gyrus is important</p>
<p>for memory formation and consolidation.</p>
<p>The dentate gyrus does seem to be one region of the brain,</p>
<p>certainly in the rodent brain,</p>
<p>but more and more it&rsquo;s seeming also in the human brain</p>
<p>where at least some new neurons</p>
<p>are added throughout the lifespan.</p>
<p>And as it turns out that cardiovascular exercise</p>
<p>can increase the proliferation</p>
<p>of new neurons in this structure,</p>
<p>and that those new neurons, excuse me,</p>
<p>are important for the formation</p>
<p>of certain types of new memories.</p>
<p>There are wonderful data showing that</p>
<p>if you use X irradiation,</p>
<p>which is a way to eliminate the formation of those new cells</p>
<p>or other tools and tricks to eliminate the formation</p>
<p>of those cells, that you block the formation</p>
<p>of certain kinds of learning and memory.</p>
<p>What does this mean?</p>
<p>Well, there are a lot of reasons</p>
<p>for the statement I&rsquo;m about to make</p>
<p>that extend far beyond neurogenesis</p>
<p>and the hippocampus learning and memory,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s very clear that getting anywhere</p>
<p>from 180, I should say a minimum of 180 to 200 minutes</p>
<p>of so-called zone two cardiovascular exercise.</p>
<p>So this is cardiovascular exercise that can be performed</p>
<p>at a pretty steady state,</p>
<p>which would allow you to just barely hold a conversation.</p>
<p>So breathing hard, but not super hard.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t sprints or high intensity interval training,</p>
<p>but doing that for 180 to 200 minutes per week total</p>
<p>is it appears the minimum threshold</p>
<p>for enhancing some of the longevity effects</p>
<p>associated with improvements in cardiovascular fitness.</p>
<p>And we believe that it is indirectly,</p>
<p>I should say indirectly through enhancements</p>
<p>in cardiovascular fitness,</p>
<p>that there are improvements</p>
<p>in hippocampal dentate gyrus neurogenesis.</p>
<p>What does that mean?</p>
<p>The improvements in cardiovascular function</p>
<p>are indirectly impacting the ability of the dentate gyrus</p>
<p>to create these new neurons.</p>
<p>To my knowledge, there&rsquo;s no direct relationship</p>
<p>between exercise and stimulating the production</p>
<p>of new neurons in the brain.</p>
<p>It seems that it&rsquo;s the improvements in blood flow</p>
<p>that also relate to improvements</p>
<p>in things like glymphatic flow,</p>
<p>the circulation of lymph fluid within the brain</p>
<p>that are enhancing neurogenesis.</p>
<p>And that neurogenesis as it appears is important.</p>
<p>Now, in fairness to the landscape of neuroscience</p>
<p>and my colleagues at Stanford and elsewhere,</p>
<p>there is a lot of debate as to whether or not</p>
<p>there is much if any neurogenesis in the adult human brain.</p>
<p>But regardless, I think the data are quite clear</p>
<p>that the 180 to 200 minutes minimum</p>
<p>of cardiovascular exercise is going to be important</p>
<p>for other health metrics.</p>
<p>Now it is clear that exercise can impact learning and memory</p>
<p>through other non-neurogenesis,</p>
<p>non-new neuron type mechanisms.</p>
<p>And one of the more exciting ones</p>
<p>that has been studied over the years</p>
<p>is this notion of hormones from bone</p>
<p>traveling in the bloodstream to the brain</p>
<p>and enhancing the function of the hippocampus.</p>
<p>The words hormones from bones is surprising to you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m here to tell you that yes, indeed,</p>
<p>your bones make hormones.</p>
<p>We call these endocrine effects.</p>
<p>So in biology, we hear about autocrine,</p>
<p>paracrine, and endocrine.</p>
<p>And those different terms refer to over what distance</p>
<p>a given chemical has an effect on a cell.</p>
<p>For instance, a cell can have an effect on itself.</p>
<p>It can have an effect on immediately neighboring cells</p>
<p>or it can have an effect on both itself,</p>
<p>immediately neighboring cells</p>
<p>and cells far, far away in the body.</p>
<p>And that last example of a given chemical</p>
<p>or substance having an effect on the cell that produced it</p>
<p>plus neighboring cells plus cells far away</p>
<p>is an endocrine effect.</p>
<p>And a lot of hormones, not all work in this fashion.</p>
<p>Hence why we sometimes hear about endocrine and hormone</p>
<p>as kind of synonymous terms.</p>
<p>Your bones make chemicals that travel in the bloodstream</p>
<p>and have these endocrine effects.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re effectively acting as hormones.</p>
<p>And one such chemical is something called osteocalcin.</p>
<p>Now these findings arrived to us through various labs,</p>
<p>but one of the more important labs</p>
<p>for sake of this discussion today</p>
<p>is the laboratory of Eric Kandel</p>
<p>at Columbia Medical School.</p>
<p>Eric is now, I believe in his mid to late nineties,</p>
<p>still very sharp and has studied learning and memory.</p>
<p>It also turns out that he is an avid swimmer.</p>
<p>Now I happen to know that Eric swims anywhere</p>
<p>from a half a mile to a mile a day.</p>
<p>And again, this is anecdata.</p>
<p>This is, I&rsquo;m not referring to the published data just yet,</p>
<p>but he credits that exercise as one of the ways</p>
<p>in which he keeps his brain sharp</p>
<p>and has indeed kept his brain sharp for many, many decades.</p>
<p>And as I mentioned before, he&rsquo;s well into his nineties.</p>
<p>So pretty impressive.</p>
<p>His laboratory has studied the effects of exercise</p>
<p>on hippocampal function and memory,</p>
<p>and other laboratories have done that as well.</p>
<p>And what they found is that cardiovascular exercise</p>
<p>and perhaps other forms of exercise too,</p>
<p>but mainly cardiovascular exercise</p>
<p>creates the release of osteocalcin from the bones</p>
<p>that travels to the brain</p>
<p>and to sub-regions of the hippocampus</p>
<p>and encourages the electrical activity</p>
<p>and the formation and maintenance of connections</p>
<p>within the hippocampus</p>
<p>and keeps the hippocampus functioning well</p>
<p>in order to lay down new memories.</p>
<p>Now, osteocalcin has a lot of effects</p>
<p>besides just improving the function of the hippocampus.</p>
<p>Osteocalcin is involved in bone growth itself.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s involved in hormone regulation.</p>
<p>In fact, there&rsquo;s really nice evidence</p>
<p>that it can regulate testosterone and estrogen production</p>
<p>by the testes and ovaries</p>
<p>and a bunch of other effects in other organs of the body.</p>
<p>Because again, it&rsquo;s acting in this endocrine manner.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s arriving from bone to a lot of different organs</p>
<p>to have effects.</p>
<p>Load-bearing exercise in particular</p>
<p>turns out to be important</p>
<p>for inducing the release of osteocalcin.</p>
<p>And when you think about this, it makes sense.</p>
<p>A nervous system exists for a lot of reasons</p>
<p>to sense, perceive, et cetera.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got taste, you&rsquo;ve got smell, you&rsquo;ve got hearing,</p>
<p>but the vast majority of brain real estate,</p>
<p>especially in humans, is dedicated to two things.</p>
<p>One, vision.</p>
<p>We have an enormous amount of brain real estate</p>
<p>devoted to vision, certainly compared to other senses.</p>
<p>And to movement,</p>
<p>the ability to generate coarse movements of the body,</p>
<p>the ability, excuse me,</p>
<p>to generate fine movements of the body,</p>
<p>like the digits or to wink one eye</p>
<p>or to tilt your head in a particular way</p>
<p>or move your lips and move your face</p>
<p>and do all sorts of different things</p>
<p>in a very nuanced and detailed way.</p>
<p>So much of our brain real estate is devoted to movement</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s been hypothesized for more than a half century,</p>
<p>but especially in recent years,</p>
<p>as we&rsquo;ve learned more about the function of the brain</p>
<p>at a really detailed circuit level,</p>
<p>that the relationship between the brain and body</p>
<p>and the maintenance and perhaps even the improvement</p>
<p>of neural circuitry in the brain</p>
<p>depends on our body movements</p>
<p>and the signal from the body that our brain is still moving.</p>
<p>So think about that.</p>
<p>How would your brain know if your body was moving regularly</p>
<p>and how would it know how much it was moving?</p>
<p>And how would it know which limbs it was moving?</p>
<p>Well, you could say, if the heart rate is increased,</p>
<p>then the blood flow will be increased</p>
<p>and then the brain will know.</p>
<p>Ah, but how does your brain know</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s increased blood flow due to movement</p>
<p>and not to, for instance, just stress, right?</p>
<p>Maybe you actually can&rsquo;t move</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re very stressed about that.</p>
<p>And so the increased blood flow</p>
<p>is simply a consequence of increased stress.</p>
<p>The fact that osteocalcin is released from bone</p>
<p>and in particular can be released</p>
<p>in response to load bearing exercise.</p>
<p>So this would be running.</p>
<p>Again, weightlifting hasn&rsquo;t been tested directly,</p>
<p>but one would imagine anything that involves jumping</p>
<p>and landing or weight lifting or body weight movements</p>
<p>and things of that sort.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a signal to release osteocalcin.</p>
<p>And we know that signal occurs</p>
<p>that is directly reflective of the fact</p>
<p>that the body was moving and moving in particular ways.</p>
<p>In fact, you could imagine that big bones like your femur</p>
<p>are going to release more osteocalcin</p>
<p>or be in a position to release more osteocalcin</p>
<p>than fine movements like the movements of the digits.</p>
<p>And this idea that the body is constantly signaling</p>
<p>to the brain about the status of the body</p>
<p>and the varying needs of the brain</p>
<p>to update its brain circuitry is a really attractive idea</p>
<p>that fits entirely with the biology of exercise,</p>
<p>osteocalcin, and hippocampal function.</p>
<p>I do want to mention that I&rsquo;m not the first</p>
<p>to raise this hypothesis.</p>
<p>This hypothesis actually was discussed</p>
<p>in a fair amount of detail by John Rady,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s a professor in Harvard Medical School.</p>
<p>He wrote a book called Spark,</p>
<p>which was one of the early books,</p>
<p>at least from an academic about brain plasticity</p>
<p>and the relationship between exercise</p>
<p>and movement and plasticity.</p>
<p>And John, who I have the good fortune to know,</p>
<p>has described to me experiments,</p>
<p>or I should say observations of species</p>
<p>of ocean dwelling animals that have,</p>
<p>at least for the early part of their life,</p>
<p>a very robust and complicated nervous system.</p>
<p>But then these particular animals are in the habit</p>
<p>of plopping down onto a rock.</p>
<p>They find a kind of a safe, comfy space,</p>
<p>and they actually stick to that rock,</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t move anymore for a certain portion,</p>
<p>I should say the late portion of their life.</p>
<p>And it is at the transition between moving a lot</p>
<p>and being stationary that those animals</p>
<p>actually digest their own brain.</p>
<p>They literally metabolize a good portion</p>
<p>of their nervous system,</p>
<p>because they decide, well, I don&rsquo;t need this anymore,</p>
<p>and gobble it up, use it for its nutritional value,</p>
<p>and then sit there like a moron version of themselves</p>
<p>with a limited amount of brain tissue,</p>
<p>because they don&rsquo;t need to move anymore.</p>
<p>Now, I certainly don&rsquo;t want to give the message</p>
<p>that just moving, just exercise is sufficient</p>
<p>to keep the neural architecture of your brain</p>
<p>healthy, young, and able to learn.</p>
<p>While that might be true,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s also important to actually engage</p>
<p>in attempts to learn new material,</p>
<p>either physical material,</p>
<p>so new types of movements and skills,</p>
<p>and or new types of cognitive information,</p>
<p>languages, mathematics, history, current events,</p>
<p>all sorts of things that involve your brain.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, it&rsquo;s clear that physical movement</p>
<p>and cognitive ability,</p>
<p>and the potential to enhance cognitive ability,</p>
<p>and the ability to learn new physical skills</p>
<p>are intimately connected.</p>
<p>And osteocalcin appears to be at least one way</p>
<p>in which that brain-body relationship</p>
<p>is established and maintained.</p>
<p>So given the information about osteocalcin and movement,</p>
<p>and given the information about spiking adrenaline late,</p>
<p>or after a period of attempt to learn,</p>
<p>you might be asking when is the best time to exercise?</p>
<p>Now, unfortunately, that has not been addressed</p>
<p>in a lot of varying detail</p>
<p>where every sort of variation on the theme</p>
<p>has been carried out.</p>
<p>And yet, Wendy Suzuki&rsquo;s lab</p>
<p>has done really beautiful experiments</p>
<p>where they have people exercise,</p>
<p>generally it was in the morning,</p>
<p>but at other periods of the day as well.</p>
<p>And what they find is that at least as late as two hours</p>
<p>after that exercise,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an enhancement in learning and memory.</p>
<p>Now, I want to be clear,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t know whether or not that exercise</p>
<p>led to big increases in adrenaline.</p>
<p>It may be that those forms of exercise were modest enough,</p>
<p>or didn&rsquo;t challenge people enough,</p>
<p>that they merely got a lot of blood flow going,</p>
<p>and that the improvements in learning and memory</p>
<p>were related to blood flow,</p>
<p>and we presume increases in osteocalcin.</p>
<p>However, you could imagine a couple of different</p>
<p>logical protocols based on what we&rsquo;ve talked about.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say you were going to do a form of exercise</p>
<p>that was going to spike adrenaline a lot.</p>
<p>So this would be exercise that really challenges</p>
<p>your system and forces you to kind of push through a burn.</p>
<p>Right, so here I&rsquo;m mainly thinking</p>
<p>about cardiovascular exercise,</p>
<p>but it could even be yoga, it could be resistance training.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s going to give you a big spike in adrenaline,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to take some serious effort,</p>
<p>then logically speaking,</p>
<p>you would want to place that after a learning bout</p>
<p>in order to increase learning and memory.</p>
<p>However, if you&rsquo;re using the exercise</p>
<p>in order to enhance blood flow,</p>
<p>and to enhance osteocalcin release</p>
<p>in efforts to augment the function of your hippocampus,</p>
<p>I think it stands to reason that doing that exercise</p>
<p>sometime within the hour to three hours</p>
<p>preceding an attempt to learn makes a lot of sense.</p>
<p>And there I&rsquo;m basing it on the human data</p>
<p>from Wendy Suzuki&rsquo;s lab,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m basing it on the studies from Eric Kandel</p>
<p>and from others labs.</p>
<p>Again, right now there hasn&rsquo;t been an evaluation</p>
<p>of a lot of different protocols to arrive at the,</p>
<p>you know, peer reviewed laboratory super protocol.</p>
<p>However, since what we&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>is using activities like exercise that most of us,</p>
<p>probably perhaps all of us should be doing regularly anyway.</p>
<p>And I do believe most, if not all of us</p>
<p>should really regularly be trying to learn</p>
<p>and keep our brain functioning well</p>
<p>and acquire new knowledge</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s just a wonderful part of life.</p>
<p>And there is evidence</p>
<p>that that actually can keep your brain young, so to speak.</p>
<p>Well, then exercising either before</p>
<p>or after a learning bout makes a lot of sense</p>
<p>with the emphasis on after a learning bout,</p>
<p>if the form of exercise spikes a lot of adrenaline</p>
<p>for all the reasons we talked about before.</p>
<p>Okay, so we&rsquo;ve talked about two major categories</p>
<p>of protocols to improve memory</p>
<p>that are grounded in quality peer reviewed science.</p>
<p>And there is yet another third protocol</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ll talk about in a few minutes.</p>
<p>But before we do that,</p>
<p>I want to briefly touch on an aspect of memory.</p>
<p>In fact, two aspects of memory</p>
<p>that I get a lot of questions about.</p>
<p>The first one is photographic memory.</p>
<p>To be clear, there are people out there</p>
<p>who have a true photographic memory.</p>
<p>They can look at a page of text,</p>
<p>they can scan it with their eyes</p>
<p>and they can essentially commit that to memory</p>
<p>with very little, if any effort.</p>
<p>While it might seem that having a photographic memory</p>
<p>is a very attractive skill to have,</p>
<p>should caution you against believing that</p>
<p>because it turns out that people</p>
<p>with true photographic memory are often very challenged</p>
<p>at remembering things that they hear</p>
<p>and oftentimes are not so good at learning physical skills.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not always the case, but often that&rsquo;s the case.</p>
<p>So be careful what you wish for.</p>
<p>If you do have a photographic memory,</p>
<p>there are certain professions</p>
<p>that lend themselves particularly well to you.</p>
<p>And indeed, a lot of people with photographic memory</p>
<p>have to find a profession and have to move through life</p>
<p>in a way that is in concert with that photographic memory.</p>
<p>So again, it&rsquo;s a super ability, it&rsquo;s a hyper ability,</p>
<p>and yet it&rsquo;s not necessarily one</p>
<p>that is desirable for most people.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also this category</p>
<p>of what are called super recognizers.</p>
<p>These people are, I should mention,</p>
<p>highly employable by government agencies.</p>
<p>These are people that have an absolutely astonishing ability</p>
<p>to recognize faces and to match faces to templates.</p>
<p>They can look at a photograph of say somebody</p>
<p>on a most wanted list,</p>
<p>and then they can look at video footage</p>
<p>of let&rsquo;s say an airport or a mall or a city street</p>
<p>at fairly low resolution,</p>
<p>and they can spot the person whose face matches</p>
<p>that photograph that they looked at.</p>
<p>Even if that video or other footage</p>
<p>is of people&rsquo;s profiles or even the tops of their heads</p>
<p>or even just a portion of their forehead,</p>
<p>these people have just an incredible ability</p>
<p>to recognize faces and to template match.</p>
<p>And again, these people often will take jobs with agencies</p>
<p>where this sort of thing is important.</p>
<p>Some of you out there probably are super recognizers</p>
<p>and may or may not notice it.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve ever had the experience of watching a movie</p>
<p>and thought to yourself,</p>
<p>wow, her mouth looks so much like my cousin&rsquo;s mouth,</p>
<p>or you look at a character in a movie or television show,</p>
<p>and you think, wow,</p>
<p>they look almost like the younger sister of so-and-so,</p>
<p>well, then it&rsquo;s very likely that you have this,</p>
<p>or at least a mild form of this super recognizer ability.</p>
<p>That is not memory per se.</p>
<p>That is the hyper-functioning of an area of the brain</p>
<p>that we call the fusiform gyrus.</p>
<p>The fusiform gyrus is literally a face recognition area</p>
<p>and a face template matching area,</p>
<p>and it harbors neurons that respond to faces generally.</p>
<p>So as humans and other non-human primates</p>
<p>care a lot about faces and their emotional content</p>
<p>and the identity of faces is super important to us</p>
<p>for all the kinds of reasons that are probably obvious,</p>
<p>knowing who&rsquo;s friend, who&rsquo;s foe, who do you know well,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s famous, who&rsquo;s not famous, et cetera.</p>
<p>That is not memory per se.</p>
<p>And yet, if you&rsquo;re a super recognizer,</p>
<p>or I guess we could call it a moderate face recognizer</p>
<p>or not very good at recognizing faces,</p>
<p>because indeed there are some people</p>
<p>that are kind of face blind.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t actually recognize people</p>
<p>when they walk in the room.</p>
<p>I used to work with somebody like this.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d walk into his office and he&rsquo;d say,</p>
<p>are you rich or are you Andrew?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say, well, am I rich rich?</p>
<p>Like, you know, wealth rich?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;d say, no, are you Richard or are you Andrew?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d say, I&rsquo;m Andrew.</p>
<p>We know each other really well.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;d say, oh, I&rsquo;m sorry, I&rsquo;m kind of face blind.</p>
<p>And it actually tended to be better or worse</p>
<p>depending on how much he was working.</p>
<p>Ironically, the more rested he was,</p>
<p>the more face blind he would become.</p>
<p>So it wasn&rsquo;t a sleep deprivation thing.</p>
<p>That exists, that&rsquo;s out there.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the full constellation</p>
<p>of people&rsquo;s ability to recognize faces.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not really memory.</p>
<p>And yet visual function is a profoundly powerful way</p>
<p>in which we can enhance our memory.</p>
<p>So whether or not you&rsquo;re a super recognizer of faces,</p>
<p>whether or not you are face blind or anything in between.</p>
<p>Next, I&rsquo;m going to tell you about a study</p>
<p>which points out the immense value of visual images</p>
<p>for laying down memories.</p>
<p>And you can leverage this information.</p>
<p>And this involves both the taking a photograph,</p>
<p>something that&rsquo;s actually quite easily done these days</p>
<p>with your phone,</p>
<p>as well as your ability to take mental photographs</p>
<p>by literally snapping your eyelids shut.</p>
<p>So I just briefly want to describe this paper</p>
<p>because it provides a tool that you can leverage</p>
<p>in your attempt to learn and remember things better.</p>
<p>The title of this paper is Photographic Memory,</p>
<p>the effects of our volitional photo-taking</p>
<p>on memory for visual and auditory aspects of an experience.</p>
<p>I really like this paper</p>
<p>because it refers to photographic memory,</p>
<p>not in the context of photographic memory</p>
<p>that we normally hear about</p>
<p>where people are truly photographic,</p>
<p>look at a page and somehow absorb all that information</p>
<p>and commit it to memory,</p>
<p>but rather the use of camera photographs</p>
<p>or the use of mental camera photographs,</p>
<p>literally looking at something and deciding blink</p>
<p>and snapping a, so to speak, snapping a snapshot</p>
<p>of whatever it is that you were looking at</p>
<p>and remembering the content.</p>
<p>The reason I like this paper</p>
<p>and the reason I&rsquo;m attracted to this issue</p>
<p>of mental snapshots is this is something</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve been doing since I was a kid.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why I started doing it,</p>
<p>but every once in a while,</p>
<p>I would say maybe twice a year,</p>
<p>I would look at something</p>
<p>and decide to just snap a mental snapshot of it.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve maintained very clear memories</p>
<p>of those visual scenes.</p>
<p>Two years ago, I was in an Uber and I looked out the window</p>
<p>and it was a street scene.</p>
<p>I was actually in New York at the time.</p>
<p>And I decided for reasons that are still unclear to me</p>
<p>to take a mental snapshot of this city street image,</p>
<p>even though nothing interesting in particular was happening.</p>
<p>And I do recall that there was a guy wearing a yellow shirt,</p>
<p>walking, there was some construction, et cetera.</p>
<p>I can still see that image in my mind&rsquo;s eye</p>
<p>because I took this mental snapshot.</p>
<p>This paper addresses whether or not</p>
<p>this mental snapshotting thing is real.</p>
<p>And this is something that I think a lot of people</p>
<p>will resonate with,</p>
<p>whether or not the constant taking of pictures</p>
<p>on our phones or with other devices</p>
<p>is either improving or degrading our memory.</p>
<p>You can imagine an argument for both.</p>
<p>A lot of people are taking pictures</p>
<p>that they never look at again.</p>
<p>And so in a sense,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re outsourcing their visual memory of events</p>
<p>into their phone or to some other device,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re not ever accessing the actual image again.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not looking at it, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not printing out those photos.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not scanning through your phone again.</p>
<p>Sometimes you might do that, but most of the time,</p>
<p>people don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Most of the photographs that people are taking,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not revisiting again.</p>
<p>So the motivation for this study</p>
<p>was that previous experiments had shown</p>
<p>that if people take photos of a scene or a person</p>
<p>or an object, that they are actually less good</p>
<p>at remembering the details of that scene or object, et cetera.</p>
<p>This study challenged that idea and raised the hypothesis</p>
<p>that if people are allowed to choose</p>
<p>what they take photos of, that taking photos,</p>
<p>and again, this is with a camera, not mental snapshotting,</p>
<p>that taking those photos would actually enhance their memory</p>
<p>for those objects, those places, those people,</p>
<p>and in fact, details of those objects, places, and people.</p>
<p>And indeed, that&rsquo;s what they found.</p>
<p>So in contrast to previous studies</p>
<p>where people had been more or less told,</p>
<p>take photos of these following objects</p>
<p>or these following people or these following places,</p>
<p>and then they were given a memory test at some point later,</p>
<p>in this study, people were given volitional control, right?</p>
<p>They were given agency in making the decision</p>
<p>of what to take photos of.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll just summarize the results.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll provide a link to this study.</p>
<p>Should say that some of the stuff that they tested</p>
<p>was actually pretty challenging.</p>
<p>Some of them were pottery and other forms of ceramics</p>
<p>that are of the sort that you see</p>
<p>if you go to a big museum in a big city.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;ve ever done that</p>
<p>and you see all the different objects,</p>
<p>there are a lot of details in those objects</p>
<p>and a lot of those objects look a lot alike.</p>
<p>And so, some will have two handles,</p>
<p>some will have one handle, the position of the handles,</p>
<p>how broad or narrow these things are.</p>
<p>You know, a lot of this is pretty detailed stuff.</p>
<p>They also took photos of other things.</p>
<p>So basically what they found was that</p>
<p>if people take pictures of things</p>
<p>and they choose which things they&rsquo;re taking pictures of,</p>
<p>right, it&rsquo;s up to them, it&rsquo;s volitional,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s enhanced memory for those objects later on.</p>
<p>However, it degraded their ability</p>
<p>to remember auditory information.</p>
<p>So what this means is that when we take a picture</p>
<p>of something or a person,</p>
<p>we are stamping down a visual memory of that thing,</p>
<p>and that makes sense, it&rsquo;s a photograph after all,</p>
<p>but we are actually inhibiting our ability</p>
<p>to remember the auditory, the sound components</p>
<p>of that visual scene or what the person was saying.</p>
<p>Very interesting, and points to the fact</p>
<p>that the visual system can out-compete the auditory system,</p>
<p>at least in terms of how the hippocampus</p>
<p>is encoding this information.</p>
<p>The other finding I find particularly interesting</p>
<p>within this study is that it didn&rsquo;t matter</p>
<p>whether or not they ever looked at the photos again.</p>
<p>So they actually had people take photos</p>
<p>or not take photos of different objects.</p>
<p>They had some people keep their photos</p>
<p>and they had other people delete their photos,</p>
<p>and it turns out that whether or not people kept the photos</p>
<p>or deleted those photos had no bearing</p>
<p>on whether or not they were better or worse</p>
<p>at remembering things, they were always better</p>
<p>at remembering them as compared to not taking photos of them.</p>
<p>What does this mean?</p>
<p>It means that if you really want to remember something</p>
<p>or somebody, take a photo of that thing or person,</p>
<p>pay attention while you take the photo,</p>
<p>but it doesn&rsquo;t really matter if you look at the photo again,</p>
<p>somehow the process of taking that photo,</p>
<p>probably looking at it, you know, in a camera,</p>
<p>typically we&rsquo;d say through the viewfinder</p>
<p>or now because of digital cameras on the screen,</p>
<p>on the back of that camera or on your phone,</p>
<p>that framing up of the photograph</p>
<p>stamps down a visual image in your mind</p>
<p>that is more robust at serving a memory</p>
<p>than had you just looked at that thing</p>
<p>with your own eyes, very interesting.</p>
<p>And it raises all sorts of questions for me</p>
<p>about whether or not it&rsquo;s because you&rsquo;re framing up</p>
<p>a small aperture, a small portion of the visual scene,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s one logical interpretation,</p>
<p>although they didn&rsquo;t test that.</p>
<p>I should also say that they found that whether or not</p>
<p>you looked at a photo that you took</p>
<p>or whether or not you deleted it</p>
<p>and never looked at it again,</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t just enhance visual memory</p>
<p>or the memory for the visual components of that image,</p>
<p>but it always reduced your ability</p>
<p>to remember sounds associated with that experience.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>And then last but not least,</p>
<p>and perhaps most interesting, at least to me,</p>
<p>was the fact that you didn&rsquo;t even need a camera</p>
<p>to see this effect.</p>
<p>If subjects looked at something</p>
<p>and took a mental photograph of that thing,</p>
<p>it enhanced their visual memory of that thing</p>
<p>significantly more than had they not taken a mental picture.</p>
<p>In fact, it increased their memory of that thing</p>
<p>almost as much as taking an actual photograph</p>
<p>with an actual camera.</p>
<p>And the reason I find this so interesting</p>
<p>is that a lot of what we try and learn is visual.</p>
<p>And for a lot of people,</p>
<p>the ability to learn visual information feels challenging.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll look at something</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll try and create some detailed understanding of it.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll try and understand the relationships</p>
<p>between things in that scene.</p>
<p>It does appear based on the study</p>
<p>that the mere decision to take a mental snapshot,</p>
<p>like, okay, I&rsquo;m going to blink my eyelids</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m going to take a snapshot of whatever it is I see,</p>
<p>can actually stamp down a visual memory</p>
<p>much in the same way that a camera</p>
<p>can stamp down a visual memory,</p>
<p>of course, through vastly distinct mechanisms.</p>
<p>No discussion of memory would be complete</p>
<p>without a discussion of the ever intriguing phenomenon</p>
<p>known as deja vu.</p>
<p>This sense that we&rsquo;ve experienced something before,</p>
<p>but we can&rsquo;t quite put our finger on it.</p>
<p>Where and when did it happen?</p>
<p>Or the sense that we&rsquo;ve been someplace before</p>
<p>or that we are in a familiar state or place</p>
<p>or context of some kind.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;ve talked about this on the podcast before,</p>
<p>at least I think I have.</p>
<p>And the way this works has been defined</p>
<p>largely by the wonderful work of Susumu Tonegawa</p>
<p>at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, MIT.</p>
<p>Susumu collected a Nobel prize quite appropriately</p>
<p>for his beautiful work on immunology.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s also a highly accomplished neuroscientist</p>
<p>who studies memory and learning and deja vu.</p>
<p>And I should also mention the beautiful work</p>
<p>of Mark Mayford at the Scripps Institute and UC San Diego.</p>
<p>Beautiful work on this notion of deja vu.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what they discovered.</p>
<p>They evaluated the patterns of neural firing</p>
<p>in the hippocampus as subjects learn new things.</p>
<p>Okay?</p>
<p>So neuron A fires, then neuron B fires,</p>
<p>then neuron C fires in a particular sequence.</p>
<p>Again, the firing of neurons in a particular sequence,</p>
<p>like the playing of keys on a piano in a particular sequence</p>
<p>leads to a particular song on the piano</p>
<p>and leads to a particular memory</p>
<p>of an experience within the brain.</p>
<p>They then used some molecular tools and tricks</p>
<p>to label and capture those neurons</p>
<p>such that they could go back later</p>
<p>and activate those neurons in either the same sequence</p>
<p>or in a different sequence to the one that occurred</p>
<p>during the formation of the memory.</p>
<p>And to make a long story short</p>
<p>and to summarize multiple papers</p>
<p>published in incredibly high tier journals,</p>
<p>journals like Nature and Science,</p>
<p>which are extremely stringent,</p>
<p>found that whether or not those particular neurons</p>
<p>were played in the precise sequence</p>
<p>that happened when they encoded the memory</p>
<p>or whether or not those neurons were played</p>
<p>in a different sequence,</p>
<p>or even if those neurons were played, activated that is,</p>
<p>all at once with no temporal sequence,</p>
<p>all firing in concert all at once,</p>
<p>evoked the same behavior</p>
<p>and in some sense, the same memory.</p>
<p>So at a neural circuit level, this is deja vu.</p>
<p>This is a different pattern of firing</p>
<p>of neurons in the brain,</p>
<p>leading to the same sense of what happened,</p>
<p>leading to a particular emotional state or behavior.</p>
<p>Now, whether or not the same sort of phenomenon occurs</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re walking down the street</p>
<p>and suddenly you feel as if,</p>
<p>wow, I feel like I&rsquo;ve been here before.</p>
<p>You meet someone and you feel like,</p>
<p>gosh, I feel like I know you.</p>
<p>I feel like there&rsquo;s some familiarity here</p>
<p>that I can&rsquo;t quite put my finger on.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know for sure that that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s happening,</p>
<p>but this is the most mechanistic and logical explanation</p>
<p>for what has for many decades, if not hundreds of years,</p>
<p>has been described as deja vu.</p>
<p>So for those of you that experienced deja vu often,</p>
<p>just know that this reflects a normal pattern</p>
<p>of encoding experiences and events within your hippocampus.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not aware of any pathological situations</p>
<p>where the presence of deja vu inhibits daily life.</p>
<p>Some people like the sensation of deja vu.</p>
<p>Other people don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Almost everybody, however, describes it as somewhat eerie.</p>
<p>This idea that even though you&rsquo;re in a very different place,</p>
<p>even though you&rsquo;re interacting with a very different person</p>
<p>that you could somehow feel as if this has happened before.</p>
<p>And just realize this, that your hippocampus,</p>
<p>while it is exquisitely good at encoding</p>
<p>new types of perceptions, new experiences, new emotions,</p>
<p>new contingencies and relationships of life events,</p>
<p>it is not infinitely large,</p>
<p>nor does it have an infinite bucket</p>
<p>full of different options of different sequences</p>
<p>for those neurons to play.</p>
<p>So in a lot of ways, it makes perfect sense</p>
<p>that sometimes we would feel as if a given experience</p>
<p>had happened previously.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to cover one additional tool</p>
<p>that you can use to improve learning and memory.</p>
<p>And I should mention, this is a particularly powerful one.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s one that I&rsquo;m definitely going to employ myself.</p>
<p>This is based on a paper from none other than Wendy Suzuki</p>
<p>at New York University.</p>
<p>We talked about her a little bit earlier.</p>
<p>And again, she&rsquo;s going to be on the podcast</p>
<p>in our next episode and is just an incredible researcher.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve known Wendy for a number of years,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s only in the last, I would say five or six years</p>
<p>that she&rsquo;s really shifted her laboratory</p>
<p>toward generating protocols that human beings can use.</p>
<p>And she&rsquo;s putting that to great effect,</p>
<p>great positive effect, I should say,</p>
<p>publishing papers of the sort that I&rsquo;m about to describe,</p>
<p>but also incorporating some of these tools and protocols</p>
<p>into the learning curriculum</p>
<p>and the lifestyle curriculum of students at NYU,</p>
<p>which I think is a terrific initiative.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t need to be an NYU student</p>
<p>in order to benefit from her work.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to tell you about some of that work now,</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;ll tell you about this and much more</p>
<p>in the episode that follows this one.</p>
<p>The title of this paper will tell you a lot</p>
<p>about where we&rsquo;re going.</p>
<p>The title is,</p>
<p>Brief Daily Meditation Enhances Attention, Memory,</p>
<p>Mood, and Emotional Regulation</p>
<p>in Non-Experienced Meditators.</p>
<p>If ever there was an incentive to meditate,</p>
<p>it is the data contained within this paper.</p>
<p>I want to briefly describe the study,</p>
<p>and then I also want to emphasize</p>
<p>that when you meditate is absolutely critical.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll talk about that just at the end.</p>
<p>This is a study that involves subjects aged 18 to 45,</p>
<p>none of whom were experienced meditators</p>
<p>prior to this study.</p>
<p>There were two general groups in this study.</p>
<p>One group did a 13 minute long meditation,</p>
<p>and this meditation was a fairly conventional meditation.</p>
<p>They would sit or lie down.</p>
<p>They would do somewhat of a body scan,</p>
<p>evaluating, for instance,</p>
<p>how tense or relaxed they felt throughout their body,</p>
<p>and they would focus on their breathing,</p>
<p>trying to bring their attention back to their breathing</p>
<p>and to the state of their body as the meditation progressed.</p>
<p>The other group, which we can call the control group,</p>
<p>listened to, of all things, a podcast.</p>
<p>They did not listen to this podcast.</p>
<p>They listened to Radiolab, which is a popular podcast</p>
<p>for an equivalent amount of time,</p>
<p>but they were not instructed to do any kind of body scan</p>
<p>or pay attention to their breathing.</p>
<p>Every subject in the study either meditated daily</p>
<p>or listened to a equivalent duration podcast daily</p>
<p>for a period of eight weeks.</p>
<p>And the experimenters measured a large number of things,</p>
<p>of variables, as we say.</p>
<p>They looked at measures of emotion regulation.</p>
<p>They actually measured cortisol, a stress hormone.</p>
<p>They measured, as the title suggests,</p>
<p>attention and memory and so forth.</p>
<p>And the basic takeaway of the study is that eight weeks,</p>
<p>but not four weeks,</p>
<p>of this daily 13-minute-a-day meditation</p>
<p>had a significant effect in improving attention,</p>
<p>memory, mood, and emotion regulation.</p>
<p>I find this study to be very interesting</p>
<p>and, in fact, important because most of us have heard</p>
<p>about the positive effects of meditation</p>
<p>on things like stress reduction</p>
<p>or on things such as improving sleep.</p>
<p>And I want to come back to sleep in a few moments</p>
<p>because it turns out to be a very important feature</p>
<p>of this study.</p>
<p>This particular study I like so much</p>
<p>because they used a really broad array</p>
<p>of measurements for cognitive function.</p>
<p>Things like the Wisconsin card sorting task.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to go into this.</p>
<p>Things like the Stroop task.</p>
<p>And they also, as I mentioned, measured cortisol</p>
<p>and many other things, including, not surprisingly, memory</p>
<p>and people&rsquo;s ability to remember</p>
<p>certain types of information.</p>
<p>In fact, varied types of information.</p>
<p>And the basic takeaway was, again,</p>
<p>that you could get really robust improvements</p>
<p>in learning and memory, mood, and attention</p>
<p>from just 13 minutes a day of meditation.</p>
<p>Now, there&rsquo;s an important twist in this study</p>
<p>that I want to emphasize.</p>
<p>If you read into the discussion of this study,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s mentioned that somehow meditation did not improve</p>
<p>but actually impaired sleep quality</p>
<p>compared to the control subjects.</p>
<p>You might think, wow, why would that be?</p>
<p>I mean, meditation is supposed to reduce our stress.</p>
<p>Stress is supposed to inhibit sleep.</p>
<p>And therefore, why would sleep get worse?</p>
<p>Well, what&rsquo;s interesting is the time of day</p>
<p>when most of these subjects tended to do their meditation.</p>
<p>Most of the subjects in this study</p>
<p>did their meditation late in the day.</p>
<p>This is often the case in experiments.</p>
<p>I know this because we run experiments</p>
<p>with human subjects in my laboratory</p>
<p>and people are paid some amount of money</p>
<p>in order to participate</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;re given something as compensation</p>
<p>for being in the study.</p>
<p>But oftentimes the meditation, or in the case of my lab,</p>
<p>the respiration work or other kinds of things</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re assigned to do are not their top, top priority.</p>
<p>And we understand this.</p>
<p>But in this study, the majority of subjects,</p>
<p>here I&rsquo;m reading,</p>
<p>completed their meditation sessions</p>
<p>from somewhere between 8 and 11 p.m.</p>
<p>and sometimes even between 12 and 3 a.m.</p>
<p>I think there probably were a lot of college students</p>
<p>enrolled in this study</p>
<p>and their hours often are late shifted.</p>
<p>That impaired sleep,</p>
<p>and this raises a bigger theme that I think is important</p>
<p>many times before on this podcast</p>
<p>and certainly in the episode on mastering sleep</p>
<p>and conquering or mastering stress.</p>
<p>Those episodes, we talked about the value again</p>
<p>of these non-sleep deep rest protocols, NSDR,</p>
<p>for reducing the activity of your sympathetic nervous system</p>
<p>the alertness, so-called stress arm</p>
<p>of your autonomic nervous system</p>
<p>that makes you feel really alert.</p>
<p>NSDR is superb for reducing your level of alertness,</p>
<p>increasing your level of calmness</p>
<p>and putting you into a so-called</p>
<p>more parasympathetic relaxed state.</p>
<p>Meditation does that too, but it also increases attention.</p>
<p>If you think about meditation,</p>
<p>meditation involves focusing on your breath</p>
<p>and constantly focusing back on your breath</p>
<p>and trying to avoid the distraction</p>
<p>of things you&rsquo;re thinking or things that you&rsquo;re hearing</p>
<p>and coming so-called back to your body, back to your breath.</p>
<p>So meditation is actually has a high attentional load.</p>
<p>It requires a lot of prefrontal cortical activity</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s involved in attention,</p>
<p>which then logically relates</p>
<p>to the one of the outcomes of this study,</p>
<p>which is that attention abilities improved</p>
<p>in daily meditators.</p>
<p>It also points out that increasing the level of attention</p>
<p>and the activity of your prefrontal cortex may,</p>
<p>and I want to emphasize may because I&rsquo;m here,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m speculating about the underlying mechanism,</p>
<p>inhibit your ability to fall asleep.</p>
<p>So while we have meditation on the one hand</p>
<p>that does tend to put us into a calm state,</p>
<p>but it is a calm, very focused state.</p>
<p>In fact, attention and focus are inherent</p>
<p>to most forms of meditation.</p>
<p>Non-sleep deep rest, such as yoga nidra,</p>
<p>as some of you know it to be, or NSDR.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a terrific NSDR script that&rsquo;s available free online</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s put out by Made For,</p>
<p>so you can go to YouTube, NSDR Made For.</p>
<p>You can also just do a search for NSDR.</p>
<p>There are a number of these available out there,</p>
<p>again, at no cost.</p>
<p>Those NSDR protocols tend to put people</p>
<p>into a state of deep relaxation,</p>
<p>but also very low attention.</p>
<p>And we have to assume very low activation</p>
<p>of the prefrontal cortex.</p>
<p>So the takeaways from the study are several fold.</p>
<p>First of all, that daily meditation of 13 minutes</p>
<p>can enhance your ability to pay attention and to learn.</p>
<p>It can truly enhance memory.</p>
<p>However, you need to do that for at least eight weeks</p>
<p>in order to start to see the effects to occur.</p>
<p>And we have to presume that you have to continue</p>
<p>those meditation training sessions.</p>
<p>In fact, they found that if people only did four weeks</p>
<p>of meditation, these effects didn&rsquo;t show up.</p>
<p>Now, eight weeks might seem like a long time,</p>
<p>but I think that 13 minutes a day</p>
<p>is not actually that big of a time commitment.</p>
<p>And the results of this study certainly incentivize me</p>
<p>to start adopting a, I&rsquo;m going for 15 minutes a day now.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been a on and off meditator for a number of years.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been pretty good about it lately,</p>
<p>but I confess I&rsquo;ve been doing far shorter meditations</p>
<p>of anywhere from three to five or maybe 10 minutes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to ramp that up to 15 minutes a day.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m doing that specifically to try and access</p>
<p>these improvements in cognitive ability</p>
<p>and our abilities to learn.</p>
<p>Also based on the data in this paper,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to do those meditation sessions</p>
<p>either early in the day,</p>
<p>such as immediately after waking or close to it.</p>
<p>I might get my sunshine first.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m, as you all know,</p>
<p>very big on getting sunlight in the eyes early in the day,</p>
<p>as much as one can and as early as one can</p>
<p>once the sun is out,</p>
<p>but certainly doing it early in the day</p>
<p>and not past 5 p.m. or so in order to make sure</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t inhibit sleep.</p>
<p>Because I think this result that they describe</p>
<p>of meditation inhibiting quality sleep</p>
<p>compared to controls is an important one</p>
<p>to pay attention to, no pun intended.</p>
<p>Today, we covered a lot of aspects of memory</p>
<p>and how to improve your memory.</p>
<p>We talked about the different forms of memory</p>
<p>and we talked about some of the underlying neural circuitry</p>
<p>of memory formation.</p>
<p>And we talked about how the emotional saliency</p>
<p>and intensity of what you&rsquo;re trying to learn</p>
<p>has a profound impact on whether or not you learn</p>
<p>in response to some sort of experience,</p>
<p>whether or not that experience is reading or mathematics</p>
<p>or music or language or a physical skill, doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>The more intense of an emotional state that you&rsquo;re in</p>
<p>in the period immediately following that learning,</p>
<p>the more likely you are to remember</p>
<p>whatever it is that you&rsquo;re trying to learn.</p>
<p>And we talked about the neurochemicals</p>
<p>that explain that effect,</p>
<p>about epinephrine and corticosterones like cortisol</p>
<p>and how adjusting the timing of those is so key</p>
<p>to enhancing your memory.</p>
<p>And we talked about the different ways</p>
<p>to enhance those chemicals.</p>
<p>Everything ranging from cold water to pharmacology</p>
<p>and even just adjusting the emotional state</p>
<p>within your mind in order to stamp down</p>
<p>and remember experiences better.</p>
<p>We also talked about how to leverage exercise</p>
<p>in particular load-bearing exercise</p>
<p>in order to evoke the release of hormones like osteocalcin,</p>
<p>which can travel from your bones to your brain</p>
<p>and enhance your ability to learn.</p>
<p>And we talked about a new form of photographic memory,</p>
<p>not the traditional type of photographic memory</p>
<p>in which people can remember everything they look at</p>
<p>very easily, but rather taking mental snapshots</p>
<p>of things that you see.</p>
<p>Again, emphasizing that that will create a better memory</p>
<p>of what you see when you take that mental snapshot,</p>
<p>but will actually reduce your memory</p>
<p>for the things that you hear at that moment.</p>
<p>And we discussed the really exciting data</p>
<p>looking at how particular meditation protocols</p>
<p>can enhance memory, but also attention and mood.</p>
<p>However, if done too late in the day,</p>
<p>can actually disrupt sleep</p>
<p>precisely because those meditation protocols</p>
<p>can enhance attention.</p>
<p>Now, I know that many of you are interested</p>
<p>in neurochemicals that can enhance learning and memory.</p>
<p>And I intend to cover those in deep detail</p>
<p>in a future episode.</p>
<p>However, for sake of what was discussed today,</p>
<p>please understand that any number</p>
<p>of different neurochemicals can evoke</p>
<p>or can increase the amount of adrenaline</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s circulating in your brain and body.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s less important how one accesses</p>
<p>that increase in adrenaline, right?</p>
<p>Again, this can be done through behavioral protocols</p>
<p>or through pharmacology.</p>
<p>Assuming that those behavioral protocols</p>
<p>and pharmacology are safe for you,</p>
<p>it really doesn&rsquo;t matter how you evoke</p>
<p>the adrenaline release, because remember,</p>
<p>adrenaline is the final common pathway</p>
<p>by which particular experiences,</p>
<p>particular perceptions are stamped into memory,</p>
<p>which answers our very first question</p>
<p>raised at the beginning of the episode,</p>
<p>which is why do we remember anything at all, right?</p>
<p>That was the question that we raised.</p>
<p>Why is it that from morning till night</p>
<p>and throughout your entire life,</p>
<p>you have tons of sensory experience, tons of perceptions.</p>
<p>Why is it that some are remembered and others are not?</p>
<p>While I would never want to distill an important question</p>
<p>such as that down to a one molecule type of answer,</p>
<p>I think we can confidently say based on the vast amount</p>
<p>of animal and human research data that epinephrine,</p>
<p>adrenaline, and some of the other chemicals</p>
<p>that it acts with in concert is in fact the way</p>
<p>that we remember particular events and not all events.</p>

<p>During today&rsquo;s episode and on many previous episodes</p>
<p>of the Huberman Lab podcast, we discuss supplements.</p>
<p>While supplements aren&rsquo;t necessary for everybody,</p>
<p>many people derive tremendous benefit from them</p>
<p>for things like enhancing sleep and focus,</p>
<p>and indeed for learning and memory.</p>
<p>For that reason, the Huberman Lab podcast</p>
<p>is now partnered with Momentus Supplements.</p>
<p>The reason we partnered with Momentus is several fold.</p>
<p>First of all, we wanted to have one location</p>
<p>where people could go to access single ingredient,</p>
<p>high quality versions of the supplements</p>
<p>that we were discussing on this podcast.</p>
<p>This is a critical issue.</p>
<p>A lot of supplement companies out there</p>
<p>sell excellent supplements,</p>
<p>but they combine different ingredients</p>
<p>into different formulations,</p>
<p>which make it very hard to figure out</p>
<p>exactly what works for you</p>
<p>and to arrive at the minimal effective dose</p>
<p>of the various compounds that are best for you,</p>
<p>which we think is extremely important.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s certainly the most scientific way</p>
<p>or rigorous way to approach</p>
<p>any kind of supplementation regimen.</p>
<p>So Momentus has made these single ingredient formulations</p>
<p>on the basis of what we suggested to them.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m happy to say they also ship internationally.</p>
<p>So whether or not you&rsquo;re in the US or abroad,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll ship to you.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to see the supplements recommended</p>
<p>on the Huberman Lab podcast,</p>
<p>you can go to livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve started to assemble the supplements</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve talked about on the podcast.</p>
<p>And in the upcoming weeks,</p>
<p>they will be adding many more supplements</p>
<p>such that in a brief period of time,</p>
<p>most if not all of the compounds</p>
<p>that are discussed on this podcast</p>
<p>will be there again in single ingredient,</p>
<p>extremely high quality formulations</p>
<p>that you can use to arrive</p>
<p>at the best supplement protocols for you.</p>
<p>We also include behavioral protocols</p>
<p>that can be combined with supplementation protocols</p>
<p>in order to deliver the maximum effect.</p>
<p>Once again, that&rsquo;s livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re not already following us</p>
<p>on Twitter and Instagram,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s Huberman Lab on both Twitter and Instagram.</p>
<p>There, I describe science and science-related tools,</p>
<p>some of which overlap with the content</p>
<p>of the Huberman Lab podcast,</p>
<p>but much of which is distinct</p>
<p>from the content of the Huberman Lab podcast.</p>
<p>We also have a newsletter</p>
<p>called the Huberman Lab Neural Network.</p>
<p>That newsletter provides summary protocols</p>
<p>and information from our various podcast episodes.</p>
<p>It does not cost anything to sign up.</p>
<p>You can go to HubermanLab.com,</p>
<p>go to the menu and click on newsletter.</p>
<p>You just provide your email.</p>
<p>And I should point out,</p>
<p>we do not share your email with anyone else.</p>
<p>We have a very clear privacy policy that you can read there.</p>
<p>And that newsletter comes out about once a month.</p>
<p>You can also see some sample newsletters,</p>
<p>things like the toolkit for sleep or for neuroplasticity</p>
<p>and for various other topics covered</p>
<p>on the Huberman Lab podcast.</p>
<p>Once again, thank you for joining me today</p>
<p>to discuss the neurobiology of learning and memory</p>
<p>and how to improve your memory using science-based tools.</p>
<p>And last, but certainly not least,</p>
<p>thank you for your interest in science.</p>
