    <p>The following is a conversation with David Feroci.</p>
<p>He led the team that built Watson,</p>
<p>the IBM question answering system</p>
<p>that beat the top humans in the world</p>
<p>at the game of Jeopardy.</p>
<p>For spending a couple hours with David,</p>
<p>I saw a genuine passion,</p>
<p>not only for abstract understanding of intelligence,</p>
<p>but for engineering it to solve real world problems</p>
<p>under real world deadlines and resource constraints.</p>
<p>Where science meets engineering</p>
<p>is where brilliant, simple ingenuity emerges.</p>
<p>People who work adjoining it to</p>
<p>have a lot of wisdom earned</p>
<p>through failures and eventual success.</p>
<p>David is also the founder, CEO,</p>
<p>and chief scientist of Elemental Cognition,</p>
<p>a company working to engineer AI systems</p>
<p>that understand the world the way people do.</p>
<p>This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast.</p>

<p>support it on Patreon,</p>
<p>or simply connect with me on Twitter</p>
<p>at Lex Friedman, spelled F R I D M A N.</p>
<p>And now, here&rsquo;s my conversation with David Ferrucci.</p>
<p>Your undergrad was in biology</p>
<p>with an eye toward medical school</p>
<p>before you went on for the PhD in computer science.</p>
<p>So let me ask you an easy question.</p>
<p>What is the difference between biological systems</p>
<p>and computer systems?</p>
<p>In your, when you sit back,</p>
<p>look at the stars, and think philosophically.</p>
<p>I often wonder whether or not</p>
<p>there is a substantive difference.</p>
<p>I mean, I think the thing that got me</p>
<p>into computer science and into artificial intelligence</p>
<p>was exactly this presupposition</p>
<p>that if we can get machines to think,</p>
<p>or I should say this question,</p>
<p>this philosophical question,</p>
<p>if we can get machines to think,</p>
<p>to understand, to process information the way we do,</p>
<p>so if we can describe a procedure, describe a process,</p>
<p>even if that process were the intelligence process itself,</p>
<p>then what would be the difference?</p>
<p>So from a philosophical standpoint,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;m convinced that there is.</p>
<p>I mean, you can go in the direction of spirituality,</p>
<p>you can go in the direction of the soul,</p>
<p>but in terms of what we can experience</p>
<p>from an intellectual and physical perspective,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure there is.</p>
<p>Clearly, there are different implementations,</p>
<p>but if you were to say,</p>
<p>is a biological information processing system</p>
<p>fundamentally more capable</p>
<p>than one we might be able to build out of silicon</p>
<p>or some other substrate,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know that there is.</p>
<p>How distant do you think is the biological implementation?</p>
<p>So fundamentally, they may have the same capabilities,</p>
<p>but is it really a far mystery</p>
<p>where a huge number of breakthroughs are needed</p>
<p>to be able to understand it,</p>
<p>or is it something that, for the most part,</p>
<p>in the important aspects,</p>
<p>echoes of the same kind of characteristics?</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>I mean, so your question presupposes</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s this goal to recreate</p>
<p>what we perceive as biological intelligence.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure that&rsquo;s the,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure that&rsquo;s how I would state the goal.</p>
<p>I mean, I think that studying.</p>
<p>What is the goal?</p>
<p>Good, so I think there are a few goals.</p>
<p>I think that understanding the human brain</p>
<p>and how it works is important</p>
<p>for us to be able to diagnose and treat issues,</p>
<p>treat issues for us to understand our own strengths</p>
<p>and weaknesses, both intellectual,</p>
<p>psychological, and physical.</p>
<p>So neuroscience and understanding the brain,</p>
<p>from that perspective, there&rsquo;s a clear goal there.</p>
<p>From the perspective of saying,</p>
<p>I wanna mimic human intelligence,</p>
<p>that one&rsquo;s a little bit more interesting.</p>
<p>Human intelligence certainly has a lot of things we envy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also got a lot of problems, too.</p>
<p>So I think we&rsquo;re capable of sort of stepping back</p>
<p>and saying, what do we want out of an intelligence?</p>
<p>How do we wanna communicate with that intelligence?</p>
<p>How do we want it to behave?</p>
<p>How do we want it to perform?</p>
<p>Now, of course, it&rsquo;s somewhat of an interesting argument</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m sitting here as a human</p>
<p>with a biological brain,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m critiquing the strengths and weaknesses</p>
<p>of human intelligence and saying</p>
<p>that we have the capacity to step back</p>
<p>and say, gee, what is intelligence</p>
<p>and what do we really want out of it?</p>
<p>And that, in and of itself, suggests that</p>
<p>human intelligence is something quite enviable,</p>
<p>that it can introspect that way.</p>
<p>And the flaws, you mentioned the flaws.</p>
<p>Humans have flaws.</p>
<p>Yeah, but I think that flaws that human intelligence has</p>
<p>is extremely prejudicial and biased</p>
<p>in the way it draws many inferences.</p>
<p>Do you think those are, sorry to interrupt,</p>
<p>do you think those are features or are those bugs?</p>
<p>Do you think the prejudice, the forgetfulness, the fear,</p>
<p>what are the flaws?</p>
<p>List them all.</p>
<p>What, love?</p>
<p>Maybe that&rsquo;s a flaw.</p>
<p>You think those are all things that can be gotten,</p>
<p>get in the way of intelligence</p>
<p>or the essential components of intelligence?</p>
<p>Well, again, if you go back and you define intelligence</p>
<p>as being able to sort of accurately, precisely, rigorously,</p>
<p>reason, develop answers,</p>
<p>and justify those answers in an objective way,</p>
<p>yeah, then human intelligence has these flaws</p>
<p>in that it tends to be more influenced</p>
<p>by some of the things you said.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s largely an inductive process,</p>
<p>meaning it takes past data,</p>
<p>uses that to predict the future.</p>
<p>Very advantageous in some cases,</p>
<p>but fundamentally biased and prejudicial in other cases</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s gonna be strongly influenced by its priors,</p>
<p>whether they&rsquo;re right or wrong</p>
<p>from some objective reasoning perspective,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna favor them because those are the decisions</p>
<p>or those are the paths that succeeded in the past.</p>
<p>And I think that mode of intelligence makes a lot of sense</p>
<p>for when your primary goal is to act quickly</p>
<p>and survive and make fast decisions.</p>
<p>And I think those create problems</p>
<p>when you wanna think more deeply</p>
<p>and make more objective and reasoned decisions.</p>
<p>Of course, humans capable of doing both.</p>
<p>They do sort of one more naturally than they do the other,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re capable of doing both.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re saying they do the one</p>
<p>that responds quickly more naturally.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Because that&rsquo;s the thing we kind of need</p>
<p>to not be eaten by the predators in the world.</p>
<p>For example, but then we&rsquo;ve learned to reason through logic,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve developed science, we train people to do that.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s harder for the individual to do.</p>
<p>I think it requires training and teaching.</p>
<p>I think we are, the human mind certainly is capable of it,</p>
<p>but we find it more difficult.</p>
<p>And then there are other weaknesses, if you will,</p>
<p>as you mentioned earlier, just memory capacity</p>
<p>and how many chains of inference</p>
<p>can you actually go through without like losing your way?</p>
<p>So just focus and&hellip;</p>
<p>So the way you think about intelligence,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re really sort of floating</p>
<p>in this philosophical space,</p>
<p>but I think you&rsquo;re like the perfect person</p>
<p>to talk about this,</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;ll get to Jeopardy and beyond.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like one of the most incredible accomplishments</p>
<p>in AI, in the history of AI,</p>
<p>but hence the philosophical discussion.</p>
<p>So let me ask, you&rsquo;ve kind of alluded to it,</p>
<p>but let me ask again, what is intelligence?</p>
<p>Underlying the discussions we&rsquo;ll have</p>
<p>with Jeopardy and beyond,</p>
<p>how do you think about intelligence?</p>
<p>Is it a sufficiently complicated problem</p>
<p>being able to reason your way through solving that problem?</p>
<p>Is that kind of how you think about</p>
<p>what it means to be intelligent?</p>
<p>So I think of intelligence primarily two ways.</p>
<p>One is the ability to predict.</p>
<p>So in other words, if I have a problem,</p>
<p>can I predict what&rsquo;s gonna happen next?</p>
<p>Whether it&rsquo;s to predict the answer of a question</p>
<p>or to say, look, I&rsquo;m looking at all the market dynamics</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m gonna tell you what&rsquo;s gonna happen next,</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re in a room and somebody walks in</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re gonna predict what they&rsquo;re gonna do next</p>
<p>or what they&rsquo;re gonna say next.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re in a highly dynamic environment</p>
<p>full of uncertainty, be able to predict.</p>
<p>The more variables, the more complex.</p>
<p>The more possibilities, the more complex.</p>
<p>But can I take a small amount of prior data</p>
<p>and learn the pattern and then predict</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s gonna happen next accurately and consistently?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s certainly a form of intelligence.</p>
<p>What do you need for that, by the way?</p>
<p>You need to have an understanding</p>
<p>of the way the world works</p>
<p>in order to be able to unroll it into the future, right?</p>
<p>What do you think is needed to predict?</p>
<p>Depends what you mean by understanding.</p>
<p>I need to be able to find that function.</p>
<p>This is very much what deep learning does,</p>
<p>machine learning does, is if you give me enough prior data</p>
<p>and you tell me what the output variable is that matters,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna sit there and be able to predict it.</p>
<p>And if I can predict it accurately</p>
<p>so that I can get it right more often than not,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m smart, if I can do that with less data</p>
<p>and less training time, I&rsquo;m even smarter.</p>
<p>If I can figure out what&rsquo;s even worth predicting,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m smarter, meaning I&rsquo;m figuring out</p>
<p>what path is gonna get me toward a goal.</p>
<p>What about picking a goal?</p>
<p>Sorry, you left again.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s interesting about picking a goal,</p>
<p>sort of an interesting thing.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s where you bring in</p>
<p>what are you preprogrammed to do?</p>
<p>We talk about humans,</p>
<p>and well, humans are preprogrammed to survive.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s sort of their primary driving goal.</p>
<p>What do they have to do to do that?</p>
<p>And that can be very complex, right?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not just figuring out that you need to run away</p>
<p>from the ferocious tiger,</p>
<p>but we survive in a social context as an example.</p>
<p>So understanding the subtleties of social dynamics</p>
<p>becomes something that&rsquo;s important for surviving,</p>
<p>finding a mate, reproducing, right?</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re continually challenged with</p>
<p>complex sets of variables, complex constraints,</p>
<p>rules, if you will, or patterns.</p>
<p>And we learn how to find the functions</p>
<p>and predict the things.</p>
<p>In other words, represent those patterns efficiently</p>
<p>and be able to predict what&rsquo;s gonna happen.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a form of intelligence.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t really require anything specific</p>
<p>other than the ability to find that function</p>
<p>and predict that right answer.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s certainly a form of intelligence.</p>
<p>But then when we say, well, do we understand each other?</p>
<p>In other words, would you perceive me as intelligent</p>
<p>beyond that ability to predict?</p>
<p>So now I can predict, but I can&rsquo;t really articulate</p>
<p>how I&rsquo;m going through that process,</p>
<p>what my underlying theory is for predicting,</p>
<p>and I can&rsquo;t get you to understand what I&rsquo;m doing</p>
<p>so that you can figure out how to do this yourself</p>
<p>if you did not have, for example,</p>
<p>the right pattern matching machinery that I did.</p>
<p>And now we potentially have this breakdown</p>
<p>where, in effect, I&rsquo;m intelligent,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m sort of an alien intelligence relative to you.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re intelligent, but nobody knows about it, or I can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Well, I can see the output.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re saying, let&rsquo;s sort of separate the two things.</p>
<p>One is you explaining why you were able</p>
<p>to predict the future,</p>
<p>and the second is me being able to,</p>
<p>impressing me that you&rsquo;re intelligent,</p>
<p>me being able to know</p>
<p>that you successfully predicted the future.</p>
<p>Do you think that&rsquo;s?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s not impressing you that I&rsquo;m intelligent.</p>
<p>In other words, you may be convinced</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m intelligent in some form.</p>
<p>So how, what would convince?</p>
<p>Because of my ability to predict.</p>
<p>So I would look at the metrics.</p>
<p>When you can&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;d say, wow.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re right more times than I am.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re doing something interesting.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a form of intelligence.</p>
<p>But then what happens is, if I say, how are you doing that?</p>
<p>And you can&rsquo;t communicate with me,</p>
<p>and you can&rsquo;t describe that to me,</p>
<p>now I may label you a savant.</p>
<p>I may say, well, you&rsquo;re doing something weird,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just not very interesting to me,</p>
<p>because you and I can&rsquo;t really communicate.</p>
<p>And so now, so this is interesting, right?</p>
<p>Because now this is, you&rsquo;re in this weird place</p>
<p>where for you to be recognized</p>
<p>as intelligent the way I&rsquo;m intelligent,</p>
<p>then you and I sort of have to be able to communicate.</p>
<p>And then my, we start to understand each other,</p>
<p>and then my respect and my appreciation,</p>
<p>my ability to relate to you starts to change.</p>
<p>So now you&rsquo;re not an alien intelligence anymore.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a human intelligence now,</p>
<p>because you and I can communicate.</p>
<p>And so I think when we look at animals, for example,</p>
<p>animals can do things we can&rsquo;t quite comprehend,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t quite know how they do them,</p>
<p>but they can&rsquo;t really communicate with us.</p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t put what they&rsquo;re going through in our terms.</p>
<p>And so we think of them as sort of,</p>
<p>well, they&rsquo;re these alien intelligences,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re not really worth necessarily what we&rsquo;re worth.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t treat them the same way as a result of that.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s hard because who knows what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>So just a quick elaboration on that,</p>
<p>the explaining that you&rsquo;re intelligent,</p>
<p>the explaining the reasoning that went into the prediction</p>
<p>is not some kind of mathematical proof.</p>
<p>If we look at humans,</p>
<p>look at political debates and discourse on Twitter,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s mostly just telling stories.</p>
<p>So your task is, sorry,</p>
<p>your task is not to tell an accurate depiction</p>
<p>of how you reason, but to tell a story, real or not,</p>
<p>that convinces me that there was a mechanism by which you.</p>
<p>Ultimately, that&rsquo;s what a proof is.</p>
<p>I mean, even a mathematical proof is that.</p>
<p>Because ultimately, the other mathematicians</p>
<p>have to be convinced by your proof.</p>
<p>Otherwise, in fact, there have been.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the metric for success, yeah.</p>
<p>There have been several proofs out there</p>
<p>where mathematicians would study for a long time</p>
<p>before they were convinced</p>
<p>that it actually proved anything, right?</p>
<p>You never know if it proved anything</p>
<p>until the community of mathematicians decided that it did.</p>
<p>So I mean, but it&rsquo;s a real thing, right?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s sort of the point, right?</p>
<p>Is that ultimately, this notion of understanding us,</p>
<p>understanding something is ultimately a social concept.</p>
<p>In other words, I have to convince enough people</p>
<p>that I did this in a reasonable way.</p>
<p>I did this in a way that other people can understand</p>
<p>and replicate and that it makes sense to them.</p>
<p>So human intelligence is bound together in that way.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re bound up in that sense.</p>
<p>We sort of never really get away with it</p>
<p>until we can sort of convince others</p>
<p>that our thinking process makes sense.</p>
<p>Did you think the general question of intelligence</p>
<p>is then also a social construct?</p>
<p>So if we ask questions of an artificial intelligence system,</p>
<p>is this system intelligent?</p>
<p>The answer will ultimately be a socially constructed.</p>
<p>I think, so I think I&rsquo;m making two statements.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m saying we can try to define intelligence</p>
<p>in this super objective way that says, here&rsquo;s this data.</p>
<p>I wanna predict this type of thing, learn this function.</p>
<p>And then if you get it right, often enough,</p>
<p>we consider you intelligent.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s more like a sub bond.</p>
<p>I think it is.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s not useful.</p>
<p>It could be incredibly useful.</p>
<p>It could be solving a problem we can&rsquo;t otherwise solve</p>
<p>and can solve it more reliably than we can.</p>
<p>But then there&rsquo;s this notion of,</p>
<p>can humans take responsibility</p>
<p>for the decision that you&rsquo;re making?</p>
<p>Can we make those decisions ourselves?</p>
<p>Can we relate to the process that you&rsquo;re going through?</p>
<p>And now you as an agent,</p>
<p>whether you&rsquo;re a machine or another human, frankly,</p>
<p>are now obliged to make me understand</p>
<p>how it is that you&rsquo;re arriving at that answer</p>
<p>and allow me, me or obviously a community</p>
<p>or a judge of people to decide</p>
<p>whether or not that makes sense.</p>
<p>And by the way, that happens with the humans as well.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re sitting down with your staff, for example,</p>
<p>and you ask for suggestions about what to do next.</p>
<p>And someone says, oh, I think you should buy.</p>
<p>And I actually think you should buy this much</p>
<p>or whatever or sell or whatever it is.</p>
<p>Or I think you should launch the product today or tomorrow</p>
<p>or launch this product versus that product,</p>
<p>whatever the decision may be.</p>
<p>And you ask why.</p>
<p>And the person says,</p>
<p>I just have a good feeling about it.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re not very satisfied.</p>
<p>Now, that person could be,</p>
<p>you might say, well, you&rsquo;ve been right before,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m gonna put the company on the line.</p>
<p>Can you explain to me why I should believe this?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And that explanation may have nothing to do with the truth.</p>
<p>You just, the ultimate.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gotta convince the other person.</p>
<p>Still be wrong, still be wrong.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s gotta be convincing.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s ultimately gotta be convincing.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m saying it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re bound together, right?</p>
<p>Our intelligences are bound together in that sense.</p>
<p>We have to understand each other.</p>
<p>And if, for example, you&rsquo;re giving me an explanation,</p>
<p>I mean, this is a very important point, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re giving me an explanation,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m not good,</p>
<p>and then I&rsquo;m not good at reasoning well,</p>
<p>and being objective,</p>
<p>and following logical paths and consistent paths,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m not good at measuring</p>
<p>and sort of computing probabilities across those paths.</p>
<p>What happens is collectively,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not gonna do well.</p>
<p>How hard is that problem?</p>
<p>The second one.</p>
<p>So I think we&rsquo;ll talk quite a bit about the first</p>
<p>on a specific objective metric benchmark performing well.</p>
<p>But being able to explain the steps,</p>
<p>the reasoning, how hard is that problem?</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s very hard.</p>
<p>I mean, I think that that&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>well, it&rsquo;s hard for humans.</p>
<p>The thing that&rsquo;s hard for humans, as you know,</p>
<p>may not necessarily be hard for computers</p>
<p>and vice versa.</p>
<p>So, sorry, so how hard is that problem for computers?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s hard for computers,</p>
<p>and the reason why I related to,</p>
<p>or saying that it&rsquo;s also hard for humans</p>
<p>is because I think when we step back</p>
<p>and we say we wanna design computers to do that,</p>
<p>one of the things we have to recognize</p>
<p>is we&rsquo;re not sure how to do it well.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure we have a recipe for that.</p>
<p>And even if you wanted to learn it,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not clear exactly what data we use</p>
<p>and what judgments we use to learn that well.</p>
<p>And so what I mean by that is</p>
<p>if you look at the entire enterprise of science,</p>
<p>science is supposed to be at about</p>
<p>objective reason and reason, right?</p>
<p>So we think about, gee, who&rsquo;s the most intelligent person</p>
<p>or group of people in the world?</p>
<p>Do we think about the savants who can close their eyes</p>
<p>and give you a number?</p>
<p>We think about the think tanks,</p>
<p>or the scientists or the philosophers</p>
<p>who kind of work through the details</p>
<p>and write the papers and come up with the thoughtful,</p>
<p>logical proofs and use the scientific method.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s the latter.</p>
<p>And my point is that how do you train someone to do that?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what I mean by it&rsquo;s hard.</p>
<p>How do you, what&rsquo;s the process of training people</p>
<p>to do that well?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a hard process.</p>
<p>We work, as a society, we work pretty hard</p>
<p>to get other people to understand our thinking</p>
<p>and to convince them of things.</p>
<p>Now we could persuade them,</p>
<p>obviously you talked about this,</p>
<p>like human flaws or weaknesses,</p>
<p>we can persuade them through emotional means.</p>
<p>But to get them to understand and connect to</p>
<p>and follow a logical argument is difficult.</p>
<p>We try it, we do it, we do it as scientists,</p>
<p>we try to do it as journalists,</p>
<p>we try to do it as even artists in many forms,</p>
<p>as writers, as teachers.</p>
<p>We go through a fairly significant training process</p>
<p>to do that.</p>
<p>And then we could ask, well, why is that so hard?</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s hard.</p>
<p>And for humans, it takes a lot of work.</p>
<p>And when we step back and say,</p>
<p>well, how do we get a machine to do that?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a vexing question.</p>
<p>How would you begin to try to solve that?</p>
<p>And maybe just a quick pause,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s an optimistic notion</p>
<p>in the things you&rsquo;re describing,</p>
<p>which is being able to explain something through reason.</p>
<p>But if you look at algorithms that recommend things</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ll look at next, whether it&rsquo;s Facebook, Google,</p>
<p>advertisement based companies, their goal is to convince you</p>
<p>to buy things based on anything.</p>
<p>So that could be reason,</p>
<p>because the best of advertisement is showing you things</p>
<p>that you really do need and explain why you need it.</p>
<p>But it could also be through emotional manipulation.</p>
<p>The algorithm that describes why a certain decision</p>
<p>was made, how hard is it to do it</p>
<p>through emotional manipulation?</p>
<p>And why is that a good or a bad thing?</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve kind of focused on reason, logic,</p>
<p>really showing in a clear way why something is good.</p>
<p>One, is that even a thing that us humans do?</p>
<p>And two, how do you think of the difference</p>
<p>in the reasoning aspect and the emotional manipulation?</p>
<p>So you call it emotional manipulation,</p>
<p>but more objectively is essentially saying,</p>
<p>there are certain features of things</p>
<p>that seem to attract your attention.</p>
<p>I mean, it kind of give you more of that stuff.</p>
<p>Manipulation is a bad word.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, I&rsquo;m not saying it&rsquo;s good right or wrong.</p>
<p>It works to get your attention</p>
<p>and it works to get you to buy stuff.</p>
<p>And when you think about algorithms that look</p>
<p>at the patterns of features</p>
<p>that you seem to be spending your money on</p>
<p>and say, I&rsquo;m gonna give you something</p>
<p>with a similar pattern.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m gonna learn that function</p>
<p>because the objective is to get you to click on it</p>
<p>or get you to buy it or whatever it is.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, I mean, it is what it is.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s what the algorithm does.</p>
<p>You can argue whether it&rsquo;s good or bad.</p>
<p>It depends what your goal is.</p>
<p>I guess this seems to be very useful</p>
<p>for convincing, for telling a story.</p>
<p>For convincing humans, it&rsquo;s good</p>
<p>because again, this goes back to what is the human behavior</p>
<p>like, how does the human brain respond to things?</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a more optimistic view of that too,</p>
<p>which is that if you&rsquo;re searching</p>
<p>for certain kinds of things,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve already reasoned that you need them.</p>
<p>And these algorithms are saying, look, that&rsquo;s up to you</p>
<p>to reason whether you need something or not.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s your job.</p>
<p>You may have an unhealthy addiction to this stuff</p>
<p>or you may have a reasoned and thoughtful explanation</p>
<p>for why it&rsquo;s important to you.</p>
<p>And the algorithms are saying, hey, that&rsquo;s like, whatever.</p>
<p>Like, that&rsquo;s your problem.</p>
<p>All I know is you&rsquo;re buying stuff like that.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re interested in stuff like that.</p>
<p>Could be a bad reason, could be a good reason.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s up to you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna show you more of that stuff.</p>
<p>And I think that it&rsquo;s not good or bad.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not reasoned or not reasoned.</p>
<p>The algorithm is doing what it does,</p>
<p>which is saying, you seem to be interested in this.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna show you more of that stuff.</p>
<p>And I think we&rsquo;re seeing this not just in buying stuff,</p>
<p>but even in social media.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re reading this kind of stuff.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not judging on whether it&rsquo;s good or bad.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not reasoning at all.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just saying, I&rsquo;m gonna show you other stuff</p>
<p>with similar features.</p>
<p>And like, and that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>And I wash my hands from it and I say,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s all that&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>You know, there is, people are so harsh on AI systems.</p>
<p>So one, the bar of performance is extremely high.</p>
<p>And yet we also ask them to, in the case of social media,</p>
<p>to help find the better angels of our nature</p>
<p>and help make a better society.</p>
<p>What do you think about the role of AI there?</p>
<p>So that, I agree with you.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the interesting dichotomy, right?</p>
<p>Because on one hand, we&rsquo;re sitting there</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re sort of doing the easy part,</p>
<p>which is finding the patterns.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not building, the system&rsquo;s not building a theory</p>
<p>that is consumable and understandable to other humans</p>
<p>that can be explained and justified.</p>
<p>And so on one hand to say, oh, you know, AI is doing this.</p>
<p>Why isn&rsquo;t doing this other thing?</p>
<p>Well, this other thing&rsquo;s a lot harder.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s interesting to think about why it&rsquo;s harder.</p>
<p>And because you&rsquo;re interpreting the data</p>
<p>in the context of prior models.</p>
<p>In other words, understandings</p>
<p>of what&rsquo;s important in the world, what&rsquo;s not important.</p>
<p>What are all the other abstract features</p>
<p>that drive our decision making?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s sensible, what&rsquo;s not sensible,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s good, what&rsquo;s bad, what&rsquo;s moral,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s valuable, what isn&rsquo;t?</p>
<p>Where is that stuff?</p>
<p>No one&rsquo;s applying the interpretation.</p>
<p>So when I see you clicking on a bunch of stuff</p>
<p>and I look at these simple features, the raw features,</p>
<p>the features that are there in the data,</p>
<p>like what words are being used or how long the material is</p>
<p>or other very superficial features,</p>
<p>what colors are being used in the material.</p>
<p>Like, I don&rsquo;t know why you&rsquo;re clicking</p>
<p>on this stuff you&rsquo;re clicking.</p>
<p>Or if it&rsquo;s products, what the price is</p>
<p>or what the categories and stuff like that.</p>
<p>And I just feed you more of the same stuff.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s very different than kind of getting in there</p>
<p>and saying, what does this mean?</p>
<p>The stuff you&rsquo;re reading, like why are you reading it?</p>
<p>What assumptions are you bringing to the table?</p>
<p>Are those assumptions sensible?</p>
<p>Does the material make any sense?</p>
<p>Does it lead you to thoughtful, good conclusions?</p>
<p>Again, there&rsquo;s interpretation and judgment involved</p>
<p>in that process that isn&rsquo;t really happening in the AI today.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s harder because you have to start getting</p>
<p>at the meaning of the stuff, of the content.</p>
<p>You have to get at how humans interpret the content</p>
<p>relative to their value system</p>
<p>and deeper thought processes.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what meaning means is not just some kind</p>
<p>of deep, timeless, semantic thing</p>
<p>that the statement represents,</p>
<p>but also how a large number of people</p>
<p>are likely to interpret.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s again, even meaning is a social construct.</p>
<p>So you have to try to predict how most people</p>
<p>would understand this kind of statement.</p>
<p>Yeah, meaning is often relative,</p>
<p>but meaning implies that the connections go beneath</p>
<p>the surface of the artifacts.</p>
<p>If I show you a painting, it&rsquo;s a bunch of colors on a canvas,</p>
<p>what does it mean to you?</p>
<p>And it may mean different things to different people</p>
<p>because of their different experiences.</p>
<p>It may mean something even different</p>
<p>to the artist who painted it.</p>
<p>As we try to get more rigorous with our communication,</p>
<p>we try to really nail down that meaning.</p>
<p>So we go from abstract art to precise mathematics,</p>
<p>precise engineering drawings and things like that.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re really trying to say, I wanna narrow</p>
<p>that space of possible interpretations</p>
<p>because the precision of the communication</p>
<p>ends up becoming more and more important.</p>
<p>And so that means that I have to specify,</p>
<p>and I think that&rsquo;s why this becomes really hard,</p>
<p>because if I&rsquo;m just showing you an artifact</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re looking at it superficially,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s a bunch of words on a page,</p>
<p>or whether it&rsquo;s brushstrokes on a canvas</p>
<p>or pixels on a photograph,</p>
<p>you can sit there and you can interpret</p>
<p>lots of different ways at many, many different levels.</p>
<p>But when I wanna align our understanding of that,</p>
<p>I have to specify a lot more stuff</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s actually not directly in the artifact.</p>
<p>Now I have to say, well, how are you interpreting</p>
<p>this image and that image?</p>
<p>And what about the colors and what do they mean to you?</p>
<p>What perspective are you bringing to the table?</p>
<p>What are your prior experiences with those artifacts?</p>
<p>What are your fundamental assumptions and values?</p>
<p>What is your ability to kind of reason,</p>
<p>to chain together logical implication</p>
<p>as you&rsquo;re sitting there and saying,</p>
<p>well, if this is the case, then I would conclude this.</p>
<p>And if that&rsquo;s the case, then I would conclude that.</p>
<p>So your reasoning processes and how they work,</p>
<p>your prior models and what they are,</p>
<p>your values and your assumptions,</p>
<p>all those things now come together into the interpretation.</p>
<p>Getting in sync of that is hard.</p>
<p>And yet humans are able to intuit some of that</p>
<p>without any pre.</p>
<p>Because they have the shared experience.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re not talking about shared,</p>
<p>two people having shared experience.</p>
<p>I mean, as a society.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s correct.</p>
<p>We have the shared experience and we have similar brains.</p>
<p>So we tend to, in other words,</p>
<p>part of our shared experiences are shared local experience.</p>
<p>Like we may live in the same culture,</p>
<p>we may live in the same society</p>
<p>and therefore we have similar educations.</p>
<p>We have some of what we like to call prior models</p>
<p>about the word prior experiences.</p>
<p>And we use that as a,</p>
<p>think of it as a wide collection of interrelated variables</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re all bound to similar things.</p>
<p>And so we take that as our background</p>
<p>and we start interpreting things similarly.</p>
<p>But as humans, we have a lot of shared experience.</p>
<p>We do have similar brains, similar goals,</p>
<p>similar emotions under similar circumstances.</p>
<p>Because we&rsquo;re both humans.</p>
<p>So now one of the early questions you asked,</p>
<p>how is biological and computer information systems</p>
<p>fundamentally different?</p>
<p>Well, one is humans come with a lot of pre programmed stuff.</p>
<p>A ton of program stuff.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re able to communicate</p>
<p>because they share that stuff.</p>
<p>Do you think that shared knowledge,</p>
<p>if we can maybe escape the hard work question,</p>
<p>how much is encoded in the hardware?</p>
<p>Just the shared knowledge in the software,</p>
<p>the history, the many centuries of wars and so on</p>
<p>that came to today, that shared knowledge.</p>
<p>How hard is it to encode?</p>
<p>Do you have a hope?</p>
<p>Can you speak to how hard is it to encode that knowledge</p>
<p>systematically in a way that could be used by a computer?</p>
<p>So I think it is possible to learn to,</p>
<p>for a machine to program a machine,</p>
<p>to acquire that knowledge with a similar foundation.</p>
<p>In other words, a similar interpretive foundation</p>
<p>for processing that knowledge.</p>
<p>What do you mean by that?</p>
<p>So in other words, we view the world in a particular way.</p>
<p>So in other words, we have a, if you will,</p>
<p>as humans, we have a framework</p>
<p>for interpreting the world around us.</p>
<p>So we have multiple frameworks for interpreting</p>
<p>the world around us.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re interpreting, for example,</p>
<p>socio political interactions,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re thinking about where there&rsquo;s people,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s collections and groups of people,</p>
<p>they have goals, goals largely built around survival</p>
<p>and quality of life.</p>
<p>There are fundamental economics around scarcity of resources.</p>
<p>And when humans come and start interpreting</p>
<p>a situation like that, because you brought up</p>
<p>like historical events,</p>
<p>they start interpreting situations like that.</p>
<p>They apply a lot of this fundamental framework</p>
<p>for interpreting that.</p>
<p>Well, who are the people?</p>
<p>What were their goals?</p>
<p>What resources did they have?</p>
<p>How much power influence did they have over the other?</p>
<p>Like this fundamental substrate, if you will,</p>
<p>for interpreting and reasoning about that.</p>
<p>So I think it is possible to imbue a computer</p>
<p>with that stuff that humans like take for granted</p>
<p>when they go and sit down and try to interpret things.</p>
<p>And then with that foundation, they acquire,</p>
<p>they start acquiring the details,</p>
<p>the specifics in a given situation,</p>
<p>are then able to interpret it with regard to that framework.</p>
<p>And then given that interpretation, they can do what?</p>
<p>They can predict.</p>
<p>But not only can they predict,</p>
<p>they can predict now with an explanation</p>
<p>that can be given in those terms,</p>
<p>in the terms of that underlying framework</p>
<p>that most humans share.</p>
<p>Now you could find humans that come and interpret events</p>
<p>very differently than other humans</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re like using a different framework.</p>
<p>The movie Matrix comes to mind</p>
<p>where they decided humans were really just batteries,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s how they interpreted the value of humans</p>
<p>as a source of electrical energy.</p>
<p>So, but I think that for the most part,</p>
<p>we have a way of interpreting the events</p>
<p>or the social events around us</p>
<p>because we have this shared framework.</p>
<p>It comes from, again, the fact that we&rsquo;re similar beings</p>
<p>that have similar goals, similar emotions,</p>
<p>and we can make sense out of these.</p>
<p>These frameworks make sense to us.</p>
<p>So how much knowledge is there, do you think?</p>
<p>So you said it&rsquo;s possible.</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s a tremendous amount of detailed knowledge</p>
<p>in the world.</p>
<p>You could imagine effectively infinite number</p>
<p>of unique situations and unique configurations</p>
<p>of these things.</p>
<p>But the knowledge that you need,</p>
<p>what I refer to as like the frameworks,</p>
<p>for you need for interpreting them, I don&rsquo;t think.</p>
<p>I think those are finite.</p>
<p>You think the frameworks are more important</p>
<p>than the bulk of the knowledge?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like framing.</p>
<p>Yeah, because what the frameworks do</p>
<p>is they give you now the ability to interpret and reason,</p>
<p>and to interpret and reason,</p>
<p>to interpret and reason over the specifics</p>
<p>in ways that other humans would understand.</p>
<p>What about the specifics?</p>
<p>You know, you acquire the specifics by reading</p>
<p>and by talking to other people.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m mostly actually just even,</p>
<p>if we can focus on even the beginning,</p>
<p>the common sense stuff,</p>
<p>the stuff that doesn&rsquo;t even require reading,</p>
<p>or it almost requires playing around with the world</p>
<p>or something, just being able to sort of manipulate objects,</p>
<p>drink water and so on, all of that.</p>
<p>Every time we try to do that kind of thing</p>
<p>in robotics or AI, it seems to be like an onion.</p>
<p>You seem to realize how much knowledge</p>
<p>is really required to perform</p>
<p>even some of these basic tasks.</p>
<p>Do you have that sense as well?</p>
<p>And if so, how do we get all those details?</p>
<p>Are they written down somewhere?</p>
<p>Do they have to be learned through experience?</p>
<p>So I think when, like, if you&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>sort of the physics, the basic physics around us,</p>
<p>for example, acquiring information about,</p>
<p>acquiring how that works.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, I think there&rsquo;s a combination of things going,</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a combination of things going on.</p>
<p>I think there is like fundamental pattern matching,</p>
<p>like what we were talking about before,</p>
<p>where you see enough examples,</p>
<p>enough data about something and you start assuming that.</p>
<p>And with similar input,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna predict similar outputs.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t necessarily explain it at all.</p>
<p>You may learn very quickly that when you let something go,</p>
<p>it falls to the ground.</p>
<p>But you can&rsquo;t necessarily explain that.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s such a deep idea,</p>
<p>that if you let something go, like the idea of gravity.</p>
<p>I mean, people are letting things go</p>
<p>and counting on them falling</p>
<p>well before they understood gravity.</p>
<p>But that seems to be, that&rsquo;s exactly what I mean,</p>
<p>is before you take a physics class</p>
<p>or study anything about Newton,</p>
<p>just the idea that stuff falls to the ground</p>
<p>and then you&rsquo;d be able to generalize</p>
<p>that all kinds of stuff falls to the ground.</p>
<p>It just seems like a non, without encoding it,</p>
<p>like hard coding it in,</p>
<p>it seems like a difficult thing to pick up.</p>
<p>It seems like you have to have a lot of different knowledge</p>
<p>to be able to integrate that into the framework,</p>
<p>sort of into everything else.</p>
<p>So both know that stuff falls to the ground</p>
<p>and start to reason about sociopolitical discourse.</p>
<p>So both, like the very basic</p>
<p>and the high level reasoning decision making.</p>
<p>I guess my question is, how hard is this problem?</p>
<p>And sorry to linger on it because again,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll get to it for sure,</p>
<p>as what Watson with Jeopardy did is take on a problem</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s much more constrained</p>
<p>but has the same hugeness of scale,</p>
<p>at least from the outsider&rsquo;s perspective.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m asking the general life question</p>
<p>of to be able to be an intelligent being</p>
<p>and reason in the world about both gravity and politics,</p>
<p>how hard is that problem?</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s solvable.</p>
<p>Okay, now beautiful.</p>
<p>So what about time travel?</p>
<p>Okay, I&rsquo;m just saying the same answer.</p>
<p>Not as convinced.</p>
<p>Not as convinced yet, okay.</p>
<p>No, I think it is solvable.</p>
<p>I mean, I think that it&rsquo;s a learn,</p>
<p>first of all, it&rsquo;s about getting machines to learn.</p>
<p>Learning is fundamental.</p>
<p>And I think we&rsquo;re already in a place that we understand,</p>
<p>for example, how machines can learn in various ways.</p>
<p>Right now, our learning stuff is sort of primitive</p>
<p>in that we haven&rsquo;t sort of taught machines</p>
<p>to learn the frameworks.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t communicate our frameworks</p>
<p>because of how shared they are, in some cases we do,</p>
<p>but we don&rsquo;t annotate, if you will,</p>
<p>all the data in the world with the frameworks</p>
<p>that are inherent or underlying our understanding.</p>
<p>Instead, we just operate with the data.</p>
<p>So if we wanna be able to reason over the data</p>
<p>in similar terms in the common frameworks,</p>
<p>we need to be able to teach the computer,</p>
<p>or at least we need to program the computer</p>
<p>to acquire, to have access to and acquire,</p>
<p>learn the frameworks as well</p>
<p>and connect the frameworks to the data.</p>
<p>I think this can be done.</p>
<p>I think we can start, I think machine learning,</p>
<p>for example, with enough examples,</p>
<p>can start to learn these basic dynamics.</p>
<p>Will they relate them necessarily to the gravity?</p>
<p>Not unless they can also acquire those theories as well</p>
<p>and put the experiential knowledge</p>
<p>and connect it back to the theoretical knowledge.</p>
<p>I think if we think in terms of these class of architectures</p>
<p>that are designed to both learn the specifics,</p>
<p>find the patterns, but also acquire the frameworks</p>
<p>and connect the data to the frameworks.</p>
<p>If we think in terms of robust architectures like this,</p>
<p>I think there is a path toward getting there.</p>
<p>In terms of encoding architectures like that,</p>
<p>do you think systems that are able to do this</p>
<p>will look like neural networks or representing,</p>
<p>if you look back to the 80s and 90s with the expert systems,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re more like graphs, systems that are based in logic,</p>
<p>able to contain a large amount of knowledge</p>
<p>where the challenge was the automated acquisition</p>
<p>of that knowledge.</p>
<p>I guess the question is when you collect both the frameworks</p>
<p>and the knowledge from the data,</p>
<p>what do you think that thing will look like?</p>
<p>Yeah, so I mean, I think asking the question,</p>
<p>they look like neural networks is a bit of a red herring.</p>
<p>I mean, I think that they will certainly do inductive</p>
<p>or pattern match based reasoning.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve already experimented with architectures</p>
<p>that combine both that use machine learning</p>
<p>and neural networks to learn certain classes of knowledge,</p>
<p>in other words, to find repeated patterns</p>
<p>in order for it to make good inductive guesses,</p>
<p>but then ultimately to try to take those learnings</p>
<p>and marry them, in other words, connect them to frameworks</p>
<p>so that it can then reason over that</p>
<p>in terms other humans understand.</p>
<p>So for example, at elemental cognition, we do both.</p>
<p>We have architectures that do both, both those things,</p>
<p>but also have a learning method</p>
<p>for acquiring the frameworks themselves and saying,</p>
<p>look, ultimately, I need to take this data.</p>
<p>I need to interpret it in the form of these frameworks</p>
<p>so they can reason over it.</p>
<p>So there is a fundamental knowledge representation,</p>
<p>like what you&rsquo;re saying,</p>
<p>like these graphs of logic, if you will.</p>
<p>There are also neural networks</p>
<p>that acquire a certain class of information.</p>
<p>Then they then align them with these frameworks,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s also a mechanism</p>
<p>to acquire the frameworks themselves.</p>
<p>Yeah, so it seems like the idea of frameworks</p>
<p>requires some kind of collaboration with humans.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>So do you think of that collaboration as direct?</p>
<p>Well, and let&rsquo;s be clear.</p>
<p>Only for the express purpose that you&rsquo;re designing,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re designing an intelligence</p>
<p>that can ultimately communicate with humans</p>
<p>in the terms of frameworks that help them understand things.</p>
<p>So to be really clear,</p>
<p>you can independently create a machine learning system,</p>
<p>an intelligence that I might call an alien intelligence</p>
<p>that does a better job than you with some things,</p>
<p>but can&rsquo;t explain the framework to you.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t mean it might be better than you at the thing.</p>
<p>It might be that you cannot comprehend the framework</p>
<p>that it may have created for itself that is inexplicable</p>
<p>to you.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a reality.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re more interested in a case where you can.</p>
<p>I am, yeah.</p>
<p>My sort of approach to AI is because</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve set the goal for myself.</p>
<p>I want machines to be able to ultimately communicate,</p>
<p>understanding with humans.</p>
<p>I want them to be able to acquire and communicate,</p>
<p>acquire knowledge from humans</p>
<p>and communicate knowledge to humans.</p>
<p>They should be using what inductive</p>
<p>machine learning techniques are good at,</p>
<p>which is to observe patterns of data,</p>
<p>whether it be in language or whether it be in images</p>
<p>or videos or whatever,</p>
<p>to acquire these patterns,</p>
<p>to induce the generalizations from those patterns,</p>
<p>but then ultimately to work with humans</p>
<p>to connect them to frameworks, interpretations, if you will,</p>
<p>that ultimately make sense to humans.</p>
<p>Of course, the machine is gonna have the strength</p>
<p>that it has, the richer, longer memory,</p>
<p>but it has the more rigorous reasoning abilities,</p>
<p>the deeper reasoning abilities,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;ll be an interesting complementary relationship</p>
<p>between the human and the machine.</p>
<p>Do you think that ultimately needs explainability</p>
<p>like a machine?</p>
<p>So if we look, we study, for example,</p>
<p>Tesla autopilot a lot, where humans,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ve driven the vehicle,</p>
<p>are aware of what it is.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re basically the human and machine</p>
<p>are working together there,</p>
<p>and the human is responsible for their own life</p>
<p>to monitor the system,</p>
<p>and the system fails every few miles,</p>
<p>and so there&rsquo;s hundreds,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s millions of those failures a day,</p>
<p>and so that&rsquo;s like a moment of interaction.</p>
<p>Do you see?</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s exactly right.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a moment of interaction</p>
<p>where the machine has learned some stuff,</p>
<p>it has a failure, somehow the failure&rsquo;s communicated,</p>
<p>the human is now filling in the mistake, if you will,</p>
<p>or maybe correcting or doing something</p>
<p>that is more successful in that case,</p>
<p>the computer takes that learning.</p>
<p>So I believe that the collaboration</p>
<p>between human and machine,</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s sort of a primitive example</p>
<p>and sort of a more,</p>
<p>another example is where the machine&rsquo;s literally talking</p>
<p>to you and saying, look, I&rsquo;m reading this thing.</p>
<p>I know that the next word might be this or that,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t really understand why.</p>
<p>I have my guess.</p>
<p>Can you help me understand the framework that supports this</p>
<p>and then can kind of acquire that,</p>
<p>take that and reason about it and reuse it</p>
<p>the next time it&rsquo;s reading to try to understand something,</p>
<p>not unlike a human student might do.</p>
<p>I mean, I remember when my daughter was in first grade</p>
<p>and she had a reading assignment about electricity</p>
<p>and somewhere in the text it says,</p>
<p>and electricity is produced by water flowing over turbines</p>
<p>or something like that.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s a question that says,</p>
<p>well, how is electricity created?</p>
<p>And so my daughter comes to me and says,</p>
<p>I mean, I could, you know,</p>
<p>created and produced are kind of synonyms in this case.</p>
<p>So I can go back to the text</p>
<p>and I can copy by water flowing over turbines,</p>
<p>but I have no idea what that means.</p>
<p>Like I don&rsquo;t know how to interpret</p>
<p>water flowing over turbines and what electricity even is.</p>
<p>I mean, I can get the answer right by matching the text,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t have any framework for understanding</p>
<p>what this means at all.</p>
<p>And framework really is, I mean, it&rsquo;s a set of,</p>
<p>not to be mathematical, but axioms of ideas</p>
<p>that you bring to the table and interpreting stuff</p>
<p>and then you build those up somehow.</p>
<p>You build them up with the expectation</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a shared understanding of what they are.</p>
<p>Sure, yeah, it&rsquo;s the social, that us humans,</p>
<p>do you have a sense that humans on earth in general</p>
<p>share a set of, like how many frameworks are there?</p>
<p>I mean, it depends on how you bound them, right?</p>
<p>So in other words, how big or small,</p>
<p>like their individual scope,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s lots and there are new ones.</p>
<p>I think the way I think about it is kind of in a layer.</p>
<p>I think that the architectures are being layered in that.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a small set of primitives.</p>
<p>They allow you the foundation to build frameworks.</p>
<p>And then there may be many frameworks,</p>
<p>but you have the ability to acquire them.</p>
<p>And then you have the ability to reuse them.</p>
<p>I mean, one of the most compelling ways</p>
<p>of thinking about this is a reasoning by analogy,</p>
<p>where I can say, oh, wow,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve learned something very similar.</p>
<p>I never heard of this game soccer,</p>
<p>but if it&rsquo;s like basketball in the sense</p>
<p>that the goal&rsquo;s like the hoop</p>
<p>and I have to get the ball in the hoop</p>
<p>and I have guards and I have this and I have that,</p>
<p>like where are the similarities</p>
<p>and where are the differences?</p>
<p>And I have a foundation now</p>
<p>for interpreting this new information.</p>
<p>And then the different groups,</p>
<p>like the millennials will have a framework.</p>
<p>And then, you know, the Democrats and Republicans.</p>
<p>Millennials, nobody wants that framework.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, I think, right,</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;re talking about political and social ways</p>
<p>of interpreting the world around them.</p>
<p>And I think these frameworks are still largely,</p>
<p>largely similar.</p>
<p>I think they differ in maybe</p>
<p>what some fundamental assumptions and values are.</p>
<p>Now, from a reasoning perspective,</p>
<p>like the ability to process the framework,</p>
<p>it might not be that different.</p>
<p>The implications of different fundamental values</p>
<p>or fundamental assumptions in those frameworks</p>
<p>may reach very different conclusions.</p>
<p>So from a social perspective,</p>
<p>the conclusions may be very different.</p>
<p>From an intelligence perspective,</p>
<p>I just followed where my assumptions took me.</p>
<p>Yeah, the process itself will look similar.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s a fascinating idea</p>
<p>that frameworks really help carve</p>
<p>how a statement will be interpreted.</p>
<p>I mean, having a Democrat and a Republican framework</p>
<p>and then read the exact same statement</p>
<p>and the conclusions that you derive</p>
<p>will be totally different</p>
<p>from an AI perspective is fascinating.</p>
<p>What we would want out of the AI</p>
<p>is to be able to tell you</p>
<p>that this perspective, one perspective,</p>
<p>one set of assumptions is gonna lead you here,</p>
<p>another set of assumptions is gonna lead you there.</p>
<p>And in fact, to help people reason and say,</p>
<p>oh, I see where our differences lie.</p>
<p>I have this fundamental belief about that.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s quite brilliant.</p>
<p>From my perspective, NLP,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s this idea that there&rsquo;s one way</p>
<p>to really understand a statement,</p>
<p>but that probably isn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s probably an infinite number of ways</p>
<p>to understand a statement, depending on the question.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s lots of different interpretations,</p>
<p>and the broader the content, the richer it is.</p>
<p>And so you and I can have very different experiences</p>
<p>with the same text, obviously.</p>
<p>And if we&rsquo;re committed to understanding each other,</p>
<p>we start, and that&rsquo;s the other important point,</p>
<p>if we&rsquo;re committed to understanding each other,</p>
<p>we start decomposing and breaking down our interpretation</p>
<p>to its more and more primitive components</p>
<p>until we get to that point where we say,</p>
<p>oh, I see why we disagree.</p>
<p>And we try to understand how fundamental</p>
<p>that disagreement really is.</p>
<p>But that requires a commitment</p>
<p>to breaking down that interpretation</p>
<p>in terms of that framework in a logical way.</p>
<p>Otherwise, and this is why I think of AI</p>
<p>as really complimenting and helping human intelligence</p>
<p>to overcome some of its biases and its predisposition</p>
<p>to be persuaded by more shallow reasoning</p>
<p>in the sense that we get over this idea,</p>
<p>well, I&rsquo;m right because I&rsquo;m Republican,</p>
<p>or I&rsquo;m right because I&rsquo;m Democratic,</p>
<p>and someone labeled this as Democratic point of view,</p>
<p>or it has the following keywords in it.</p>
<p>And if the machine can help us break that argument down</p>
<p>and say, wait a second, what do you really think</p>
<p>about this, right?</p>
<p>So essentially holding us accountable</p>
<p>to doing more critical thinking.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna have to sit and think about this fast.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, I love that.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s really empowering use of AI</p>
<p>for the public discourse is completely disintegrating</p>
<p>currently as we learn how to do it on social media.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>So one of the greatest accomplishments</p>
<p>in the history of AI is Watson competing</p>
<p>in the game of Jeopardy against humans.</p>
<p>And you were a lead in that, a critical part of that.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start at the very basics.</p>
<p>What is the game of Jeopardy?</p>
<p>The game for us humans, human versus human.</p>
<p>Right, so it&rsquo;s to take a question and answer it.</p>
<p>The game of Jeopardy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just the opposite.</p>
<p>Actually, well, no, but it&rsquo;s not, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really not.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really to get a question and answer,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s what we call a factoid question.</p>
<p>So this notion of like, it really relates to some fact</p>
<p>that two people would argue</p>
<p>whether the facts are true or not.</p>
<p>In fact, most people wouldn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Jeopardy kind of counts on the idea</p>
<p>that these statements have factual answers.</p>
<p>And the idea is to, first of all,</p>
<p>determine whether or not you know the answer,</p>
<p>which is sort of an interesting twist.</p>
<p>So first of all, understand the question.</p>
<p>You have to understand the question.</p>
<p>What is it asking?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a good point</p>
<p>because the questions are not asked directly, right?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all like,</p>
<p>the way the questions are asked is nonlinear.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s a little bit witty.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little bit playful sometimes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little bit tricky.</p>
<p>Yeah, they&rsquo;re asked in exactly numerous witty, tricky ways.</p>
<p>Exactly what they&rsquo;re asking is not obvious.</p>
<p>It takes inexperienced humans a while</p>
<p>to go, what is it even asking?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s sort of an interesting realization that you have</p>
<p>when somebody says, oh, what&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>Jeopardy is a question answering show.</p>
<p>And then he&rsquo;s like, oh, like, I know a lot.</p>
<p>And then you read it and you&rsquo;re still trying</p>
<p>to process the question and the champions have answered</p>
<p>and moved on.</p>
<p>There are three questions ahead</p>
<p>by the time you figured out what the question even meant.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s definitely an ability there</p>
<p>to just parse out what the question even is.</p>
<p>So that was certainly challenging.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting historically though,</p>
<p>if you look back at the Jeopardy games much earlier,</p>
<p>you know, early games. Like 60s, 70s, that kind of thing.</p>
<p>The questions were much more direct.</p>
<p>They weren&rsquo;t quite like that.</p>
<p>They got sort of more and more interesting,</p>
<p>the way they asked them that sort of got more</p>
<p>and more interesting and subtle and nuanced</p>
<p>and humorous and witty over time,</p>
<p>which really required the human</p>
<p>to kind of make the right connections</p>
<p>in figuring out what the question was even asking.</p>
<p>So yeah, you have to figure out the questions even asking.</p>
<p>Then you have to determine whether</p>
<p>or not you think you know the answer.</p>
<p>And because you have to buzz in really quickly,</p>
<p>you sort of have to make that determination</p>
<p>as quickly as you possibly can.</p>
<p>Otherwise you lose the opportunity to buzz in.</p>
<p>You mean&hellip;</p>
<p>Even before you really know if you know the answer.</p>
<p>I think a lot of humans will assume,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll process it very superficially.</p>
<p>In other words, what&rsquo;s the topic?</p>
<p>What are some keywords?</p>
<p>And just say, do I know this area or not</p>
<p>before they actually know the answer?</p>
<p>Then they&rsquo;ll buzz in and think about it.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s interesting what humans do.</p>
<p>Now, some people who know all things,</p>
<p>like Ken Jennings or something,</p>
<p>or the more recent big Jeopardy player,</p>
<p>I mean, they&rsquo;ll just buzz in.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll just assume they know all of Jeopardy</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll just buzz in.</p>
<p>Watson, interestingly, didn&rsquo;t even come close</p>
<p>to knowing all of Jeopardy, right?</p>
<p>Watson really&hellip;</p>
<p>Even at the peak, even at its best.</p>
<p>Yeah, so for example, I mean,</p>
<p>we had this thing called recall,</p>
<p>which is like how many of all the Jeopardy questions,</p>
<p>how many could we even find the right answer for anywhere?</p>
<p>Like, can we come up with, we had a big body of knowledge,</p>
<p>something in the order of several terabytes.</p>
<p>I mean, from a web scale, it was actually very small,</p>
<p>but from like a book scale,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re talking about millions of books, right?</p>
<p>So the equivalent of millions of books,</p>
<p>encyclopedias, dictionaries, books,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s still a ton of information.</p>
<p>And I think it was only 85% was the answer</p>
<p>anywhere to be found.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re already down at that level</p>
<p>just to get started, right?</p>
<p>So, and so it was important to get a very quick sense</p>
<p>of do you think you know the right answer to this question?</p>
<p>So we had to compute that confidence</p>
<p>as quickly as we possibly could.</p>
<p>So in effect, we had to answer it</p>
<p>and at least spend some time essentially answering it</p>
<p>and then judging the confidence that our answer was right</p>
<p>and then deciding whether or not</p>
<p>we were confident enough to buzz in.</p>
<p>And that would depend on what else was going on in the game.</p>
<p>Because there was a risk.</p>
<p>So like if you&rsquo;re really in a situation</p>
<p>where I have to take a guess, I have very little to lose,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;ll buzz in with less confidence.</p>
<p>So that was accounted for the financial standings</p>
<p>of the different competitors.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>How much of the game was left?</p>
<p>How much time was left?</p>
<p>Where you were in the standing, things like that.</p>
<p>How many hundreds of milliseconds</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re talking about here?</p>
<p>Do you have a sense of what is?</p>
<p>We targeted, yeah, we targeted.</p>
<p>So, I mean, we targeted answering</p>
<p>in under three seconds and.</p>
<p>Buzzing in.</p>
<p>So the decision to buzz in and then the actual answering</p>
<p>are those two different stages?</p>
<p>Yeah, they were two different things.</p>
<p>In fact, we had multiple stages,</p>
<p>whereas like we would say, let&rsquo;s estimate our confidence,</p>
<p>which was sort of a shallow answering process.</p>
<p>And then ultimately decide to buzz in</p>
<p>and then we may take another second or something</p>
<p>to kind of go in there and do that.</p>
<p>But by and large, we were saying like,</p>
<p>we can&rsquo;t play the game.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t even compete if we can&rsquo;t on average</p>
<p>answer these questions in around three seconds or less.</p>
<p>So you stepped in.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s these three humans playing a game</p>
<p>and you stepped in with the idea that IBM Watson</p>
<p>would be one of, replace one of the humans</p>
<p>and compete against two.</p>
<p>Can you tell the story of Watson taking on this game?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>It seems exceptionally difficult.</p>
<p>Yeah, so the story was that it was coming up,</p>
<p>I think to the 10 year anniversary of Big Blue,</p>
<p>not Big Blue, Deep Blue.</p>
<p>IBM wanted to do sort of another kind of really</p>
<p>fun challenge, public challenge that can bring attention</p>
<p>to IBM research and the kind of the cool stuff</p>
<p>that we were doing.</p>
<p>I had been working in AI at IBM for some time.</p>
<p>I had a team doing what&rsquo;s called</p>
<p>open domain factoid question answering,</p>
<p>which is, we&rsquo;re not gonna tell you what the questions are.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not even gonna tell you what they&rsquo;re about.</p>
<p>Can you go off and get accurate answers to these questions?</p>
<p>And it was an area of AI research that I was involved in.</p>
<p>And so it was a very specific passion of mine.</p>
<p>Language understanding had always been a passion of mine.</p>
<p>One sort of narrow slice on whether or not</p>
<p>you could do anything with language</p>
<p>was this notion of open domain and meaning</p>
<p>I could ask anything about anything.</p>
<p>Factoid meaning it essentially had an answer</p>
<p>and being able to do that accurately and quickly.</p>
<p>So that was a research area</p>
<p>that my team had already been in.</p>
<p>And so completely independently,</p>
<p>several IBM executives, like what are we gonna do?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the next cool thing to do?</p>
<p>And Ken Jennings was on his winning streak.</p>
<p>This was like, whatever it was, 2004, I think,</p>
<p>was on his winning streak.</p>
<p>And someone thought, hey, that would be really cool</p>
<p>if the computer can play Jeopardy.</p>
<p>And so this was like in 2004,</p>
<p>they were shopping this thing around</p>
<p>and everyone was telling the research execs, no way.</p>
<p>Like, this is crazy.</p>
<p>And we had some pretty senior people in the field</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re saying, no, this is crazy.</p>
<p>And it would come across my desk and I was like,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s kind of what I&rsquo;m really interested in doing.</p>
<p>But there was such this prevailing sense of this is nuts.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not gonna risk IBM&rsquo;s reputation on this.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re just not doing it.</p>
<p>And this happened in 2004, it happened in 2005.</p>
<p>At the end of 2006, it was coming around again.</p>
<p>And I was coming off of a,</p>
<p>I was doing the open domain question answering stuff,</p>
<p>but I was coming off a couple other projects.</p>
<p>I had a lot more time to put into this.</p>
<p>And I argued that it could be done.</p>
<p>And I argue it would be crazy not to do this.</p>
<p>Can I, you can be honest at this point.</p>
<p>So even though you argued for it,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the confidence that you had yourself privately</p>
<p>that this could be done?</p>
<p>Was, we just told the story,</p>
<p>how you tell stories to convince others.</p>
<p>How confident were you?</p>
<p>What was your estimation of the problem at that time?</p>
<p>So I thought it was possible.</p>
<p>And a lot of people thought it was impossible.</p>
<p>I thought it was possible.</p>
<p>The reason why I thought it was possible</p>
<p>was because I did some brief experimentation.</p>
<p>I knew a lot about how we were approaching</p>
<p>open domain factoid question answering.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been doing it for some years.</p>
<p>I looked at the Jeopardy stuff.</p>
<p>I said, this is gonna be hard</p>
<p>for a lot of the points that we mentioned earlier.</p>
<p>Hard to interpret the question.</p>
<p>Hard to do it quickly enough.</p>
<p>Hard to compute an accurate confidence.</p>
<p>None of this stuff had been done well enough before.</p>
<p>But a lot of the technologies we&rsquo;re building</p>
<p>were the kinds of technologies that should work.</p>
<p>But more to the point, what was driving me was,</p>
<p>I was in IBM research.</p>
<p>I was a senior leader in IBM research.</p>
<p>And this is the kind of stuff we were supposed to do.</p>
<p>In other words, we were basically supposed to.</p>
<p>This is the moonshot.</p>
<p>This is the.</p>
<p>We were supposed to take things and say,</p>
<p>this is an active research area.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s our obligation to kind of,</p>
<p>if we have the opportunity, to push it to the limits.</p>
<p>And if it doesn&rsquo;t work,</p>
<p>to understand more deeply why we can&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>And so I was very committed to that notion saying,</p>
<p>folks, this is what we do.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s crazy not to do this.</p>
<p>This is an active research area.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been in this for years.</p>
<p>Why wouldn&rsquo;t we take this grand challenge</p>
<p>and push it as hard as we can?</p>
<p>At the very least, we&rsquo;d be able to come out and say,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s why this problem is way hard.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what we tried and here&rsquo;s how we failed.</p>
<p>So I was very driven as a scientist from that perspective.</p>
<p>And then I also argued,</p>
<p>based on what we did a feasibility study,</p>
<p>why I thought it was hard but possible.</p>
<p>And I showed examples of where it succeeded,</p>
<p>where it failed, why it failed,</p>
<p>and sort of a high level architecture approach</p>
<p>for why we should do it.</p>
<p>But for the most part, at that point,</p>
<p>the execs really were just looking for someone crazy enough</p>
<p>to say yes, because for several years at that point,</p>
<p>everyone had said, no, I&rsquo;m not willing to risk my reputation</p>
<p>and my career on this thing.</p>
<p>Clearly you did not have such fears.</p>
<p>Okay. I did not.</p>
<p>So you dived right in.</p>
<p>And yet, for what I understand,</p>
<p>it was performing very poorly in the beginning.</p>
<p>So what were the initial approaches and why did they fail?</p>
<p>Well, there were lots of hard aspects to it.</p>
<p>I mean, one of the reasons why prior approaches</p>
<p>that we had worked on in the past failed</p>
<p>was because the questions were difficult to interpret.</p>
<p>Like, what are you even asking for, right?</p>
<p>Very often, like if the question was very direct,</p>
<p>like what city, or what, even then it could be tricky,</p>
<p>but what city or what person,</p>
<p>is often when it would name it very clearly,</p>
<p>you would know that.</p>
<p>And if there were just a small set of them,</p>
<p>in other words, we&rsquo;re gonna ask about these five types.</p>
<p>Like, it&rsquo;s gonna be an answer,</p>
<p>and the answer will be a city in this state</p>
<p>or a city in this country.</p>
<p>The answer will be a person of this type, right?</p>
<p>Like an actor or whatever it is.</p>
<p>But it turns out that in Jeopardy,</p>
<p>there were like tens of thousands of these things.</p>
<p>And it was a very, very long tail,</p>
<p>meaning that it just went on and on.</p>
<p>And so even if you focused on trying to encode the types</p>
<p>at the very top, like there&rsquo;s five that were the most,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say five of the most frequent,</p>
<p>you still cover a very small percentage of the data.</p>
<p>So you couldn&rsquo;t take that approach of saying,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just going to try to collect facts</p>
<p>about these five or 10 types or 20 types</p>
<p>or 50 types or whatever.</p>
<p>So that was like one of the first things,</p>
<p>like what do you do about that?</p>
<p>And so we came up with an approach toward that.</p>
<p>And the approach looked promising,</p>
<p>and we continued to improve our ability</p>
<p>to handle that problem throughout the project.</p>
<p>The other issue was that right from the outside,</p>
<p>I said, we&rsquo;re not going to,</p>
<p>I committed to doing this in three to five years.</p>
<p>So we did it in four.</p>
<p>So I got lucky.</p>
<p>But one of the things that that,</p>
<p>putting that like stake in the ground was,</p>
<p>and I knew how hard the language understanding problem was.</p>
<p>I said, we&rsquo;re not going to actually understand language</p>
<p>to solve this problem.</p>
<p>We are not going to interpret the question</p>
<p>and the domain of knowledge that the question refers to</p>
<p>and reason over that to answer these questions.</p>
<p>Obviously we&rsquo;re not going to be doing that.</p>
<p>At the same time,</p>
<p>simple search wasn&rsquo;t good enough to confidently answer</p>
<p>with a single correct answer.</p>
<p>First of all, that&rsquo;s like brilliant.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s such a great mix of innovation</p>
<p>and practical engineering three, four, eight.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re not trying to solve the general NLU problem.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re saying, let&rsquo;s solve this in any way possible.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>No, I was committed to saying, look,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to solving the open domain</p>
<p>question answering problem.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re using Jeopardy as a driver for that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a big benchmark.</p>
<p>Good enough, big benchmark, exactly.</p>
<p>And now we&rsquo;re.</p>
<p>How do we do it?</p>
<p>We could just like, whatever,</p>
<p>like just figure out what works</p>
<p>because I want to be able to go back</p>
<p>to the academic science community</p>
<p>and say, here&rsquo;s what we tried.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what worked.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what didn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to go in and say,</p>
<p>oh, I only have one technology.</p>
<p>I have a hammer.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m only going to use this.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to do whatever it takes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, I&rsquo;m going to think out of the box</p>
<p>and do whatever it takes.</p>
<p>One, and I also, there was another thing I believed.</p>
<p>I believed that the fundamental NLP technologies</p>
<p>and machine learning technologies would be adequate.</p>
<p>And this was an issue of how do we enhance them?</p>
<p>How do we integrate them?</p>
<p>How do we advance them?</p>
<p>So I had one researcher who came to me</p>
<p>who had been working on question answering</p>
<p>with me for a very long time,</p>
<p>who had said, we&rsquo;re going to need Maxwell&rsquo;s equations</p>
<p>for question answering.</p>
<p>And I said, if we need some fundamental formula</p>
<p>that breaks new ground in how we understand language,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re screwed.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not going to get there from here.</p>
<p>Like I am not counting.</p>
<p>My assumption is I&rsquo;m not counting</p>
<p>on some brand new invention.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m counting on is the ability</p>
<p>to take everything it has done before</p>
<p>to figure out an architecture on how to integrate it well</p>
<p>and then see where it breaks</p>
<p>and make the necessary advances we need to make</p>
<p>until this thing works.</p>
<p>Push it hard to see where it breaks</p>
<p>and then patch it up.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s how people change the world.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s the Elon Musk approach to the rockets,</p>
<p>SpaceX, that&rsquo;s the Henry Ford and so on.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>And I happen to be, in this case, I happen to be right,</p>
<p>but like we didn&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>But you kind of have to put a stake in the rest</p>
<p>of how you&rsquo;re going to run the project.</p>
<p>So yeah, and backtracking to search.</p>
<p>So if you were to do, what&rsquo;s the brute force solution?</p>
<p>What would you search over?</p>
<p>So you have a question,</p>
<p>how would you search the possible space of answers?</p>
<p>Look, web search has come a long way even since then.</p>
<p>But at the time, first of all,</p>
<p>I mean, there were a couple of other constraints</p>
<p>around the problem, which is interesting.</p>
<p>So you couldn&rsquo;t go out to the web.</p>
<p>You couldn&rsquo;t search the internet.</p>
<p>In other words, the AI experiment was,</p>
<p>we want a self contained device.</p>
<p>If the device is as big as a room, fine,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s as big as a room,</p>
<p>but we want a self contained device.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not going out to the internet.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have a lifeline to anything.</p>
<p>So it had to kind of fit in a shoe box, if you will,</p>
<p>or at least a size of a few refrigerators,</p>
<p>whatever it might be.</p>
<p>See, but also you couldn&rsquo;t just get out there.</p>
<p>You couldn&rsquo;t go off network, right, to kind of go.</p>
<p>So there was that limitation.</p>
<p>But then we did, but the basic thing was go do web search.</p>
<p>Problem was, even when we went and did a web search,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t remember exactly the numbers,</p>
<p>but somewhere in the order of 65% of the time,</p>
<p>the answer would be somewhere, you know,</p>
<p>in the top 10 or 20 documents.</p>
<p>So first of all, that&rsquo;s not even good enough to play Jeopardy.</p>
<p>You know, the words, even if you could pull the,</p>
<p>even if you could perfectly pull the answer</p>
<p>out of the top 20 documents, top 10 documents,</p>
<p>whatever it was, which we didn&rsquo;t know how to do.</p>
<p>But even if you could do that, you&rsquo;d be,</p>
<p>and you knew it was right,</p>
<p>unless you had enough confidence in it, right?</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;d have to pull out the right answer.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d have to have confidence it was the right answer.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;d have to do that fast enough to now go buzz in</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;d still only get 65% of them right,</p>
<p>which doesn&rsquo;t even put you in the winner&rsquo;s circle.</p>
<p>Winner&rsquo;s circle, you have to be up over 70</p>
<p>and you have to do it really quick</p>
<p>and you have to do it really quickly.</p>
<p>But now the problem is, well,</p>
<p>even if I had somewhere in the top 10 documents,</p>
<p>how do I figure out where in the top 10 documents</p>
<p>that answer is and how do I compute a confidence</p>
<p>of all the possible candidates?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not like I go in knowing the right answer</p>
<p>and I have to pick it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know the right answer.</p>
<p>I have a bunch of documents,</p>
<p>somewhere in there is the right answer.</p>
<p>How do I, as a machine, go out</p>
<p>and figure out which one&rsquo;s right?</p>
<p>And then how do I score it?</p>
<p>So, and now how do I deal with the fact</p>
<p>that I can&rsquo;t actually go out to the web?</p>
<p>First of all, if you pause on that, just think about it.</p>
<p>If you could go to the web,</p>
<p>do you think that problem is solvable</p>
<p>if you just pause on it?</p>
<p>Just thinking even beyond jeopardy,</p>
<p>do you think the problem of reading text</p>
<p>defined where the answer is?</p>
<p>Well, we solved that in some definition of solves</p>
<p>given the jeopardy challenge.</p>
<p>How did you do it for jeopardy?</p>
<p>So how do you take a body of work in a particular topic</p>
<p>and extract the key pieces of information?</p>
<p>So now forgetting about the huge volumes</p>
<p>that are on the web, right?</p>
<p>So now we have to figure out,</p>
<p>we did a lot of source research.</p>
<p>In other words, what body of knowledge</p>
<p>is gonna be small enough,</p>
<p>but broad enough to answer jeopardy?</p>
<p>And we ultimately did find the body of knowledge</p>
<p>that did that.</p>
<p>I mean, it included Wikipedia and a bunch of other stuff.</p>
<p>So like encyclopedia type of stuff.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you can speak to it.</p>
<p>Encyclopedias, dictionaries,</p>
<p>different types of semantic resources,</p>
<p>like WordNet and other types of semantic resources like that,</p>
<p>as well as like some web crawls.</p>
<p>In other words, where we went out and took that content</p>
<p>and then expanded it based on producing,</p>
<p>statistically producing seeds,</p>
<p>using those seeds for other searches and then expanding that.</p>
<p>So using these like expansion techniques,</p>
<p>we went out and had found enough content</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re like, okay, this is good.</p>
<p>And even up until the end,</p>
<p>we had a thread of research.</p>
<p>It was always trying to figure out</p>
<p>what content could we efficiently include.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s a lot of popular,</p>
<p>like what is the church lady?</p>
<p>Well, I think was one of the, like what,</p>
<p>where do you, I guess that&rsquo;s probably an encyclopedia, so.</p>
<p>So that was an encyclopedia,</p>
<p>but then we would take that stuff</p>
<p>and we would go out and we would expand.</p>
<p>In other words, we&rsquo;d go find other content</p>
<p>that wasn&rsquo;t in the core resources and expand it.</p>
<p>The amount of content, we grew it by an order of magnitude,</p>
<p>but still, again, from a web scale perspective,</p>
<p>this is very small amount of content.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very select.</p>
<p>We then took all that content,</p>
<p>we preanalyzed the crap out of it,</p>
<p>meaning we parsed it,</p>
<p>broke it down into all those individual words</p>
<p>and then we did semantic,</p>
<p>syntactic and semantic parses on it,</p>
<p>had computer algorithms that annotated it</p>
<p>and we indexed that in a very rich and very fast index.</p>
<p>So we have a relatively huge amount of,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say the equivalent of, for the sake of argument,</p>
<p>two to 5 million bucks.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve now analyzed all that, blowing up its size even more</p>
<p>because now we have all this metadata</p>
<p>and then we richly indexed all of that</p>
<p>and by the way, in a giant in memory cache.</p>
<p>So Watson did not go to disk.</p>
<p>So the infrastructure component there,</p>
<p>if you could just speak to it, how tough it,</p>
<p>I mean, I know 2000, maybe this is 2008, nine,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s kind of a long time ago.</p>
<p>How hard is it to use multiple machines?</p>
<p>How hard is the infrastructure component,</p>
<p>the hardware component?</p>
<p>So we used IBM hardware.</p>
<p>We had something like, I forgot exactly,</p>
<p>but close to 3000 cores completely connected.</p>
<p>So you had a switch where every CPU</p>
<p>was connected to every other CPU.</p>
<p>And they were sharing memory in some kind of way.</p>
<p>Large shared memory, right?</p>
<p>And all this data was preanalyzed</p>
<p>and put into a very fast indexing structure</p>
<p>that was all in memory.</p>
<p>And then we took that question,</p>
<p>we would analyze the question.</p>
<p>So all the content was now preanalyzed.</p>
<p>So if I went and tried to find a piece of content,</p>
<p>it would come back with all the metadata</p>
<p>that we had precomputed.</p>
<p>How do you shove that question?</p>
<p>How do you connect the big knowledge base</p>
<p>with the metadata and that&rsquo;s indexed</p>
<p>to the simple little witty confusing question?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So therein lies the Watson architecture, right?</p>
<p>So we would take the question,</p>
<p>we would analyze the question.</p>
<p>So which means that we would parse it</p>
<p>and interpret it a bunch of different ways.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;d try to figure out what is it asking about?</p>
<p>So we had multiple strategies</p>
<p>to kind of determine what was it asking for.</p>
<p>That might be represented as a simple string,</p>
<p>a character string,</p>
<p>or something we would connect back</p>
<p>to different semantic types</p>
<p>that were from existing resources.</p>
<p>So anyway, the bottom line is</p>
<p>we would do a bunch of analysis in the question.</p>
<p>And question analysis had to finish and had to finish fast.</p>
<p>So we do the question analysis</p>
<p>because then from the question analysis,</p>
<p>we would now produce searches.</p>
<p>So we would, and we had built</p>
<p>using open source search engines,</p>
<p>we modified them,</p>
<p>but we had a number of different search engines</p>
<p>we would use that had different characteristics.</p>
<p>We went in there and engineered</p>
<p>and modified those search engines,</p>
<p>ultimately to now take our question analysis,</p>
<p>produce multiple queries</p>
<p>based on different interpretations of the question</p>
<p>and fire out a whole bunch of searches in parallel.</p>
<p>And they would come back with passages.</p>
<p>So these are passive search algorithms.</p>
<p>They would come back with passages.</p>
<p>And so now let&rsquo;s say you had a thousand passages.</p>
<p>Now for each passage, you parallelize again.</p>
<p>So you went out and you parallelize the search.</p>
<p>Each search would now come back</p>
<p>with a whole bunch of passages.</p>
<p>Maybe you had a total of a thousand</p>
<p>or 5,000 whatever passages.</p>
<p>For each passage now,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d go and figure out whether or not</p>
<p>there was a candidate,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;d call it candidate answer in there.</p>
<p>So you had a whole bunch of other algorithms</p>
<p>that would find candidate answers,</p>
<p>possible answers to the question.</p>
<p>And so you had candidate answer,</p>
<p>called candidate answer generators,</p>
<p>a whole bunch of those.</p>
<p>So for every one of these components,</p>
<p>the team was constantly doing research coming up,</p>
<p>better ways to generate search queries from the questions,</p>
<p>better ways to analyze the question,</p>
<p>better ways to generate candidates.</p>
<p>And speed, so better is accuracy and speed.</p>
<p>Correct, so right, speed and accuracy</p>
<p>for the most part were separated.</p>
<p>We handle that sort of in separate ways.</p>
<p>Like I focus purely on accuracy, end to end accuracy.</p>
<p>Are we ultimately getting more questions</p>
<p>and producing more accurate confidences?</p>
<p>And then a whole nother team</p>
<p>that was constantly analyzing the workflow</p>
<p>to find the bottlenecks.</p>
<p>And then figuring out how to both parallelize</p>
<p>and drive the algorithm speed.</p>
<p>But anyway, so now think of it like,</p>
<p>you have this big fan out now, right?</p>
<p>Because you had multiple queries,</p>
<p>now you have thousands of candidate answers.</p>
<p>For each candidate answer, you&rsquo;re gonna score it.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re gonna use all the data that built up.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna use the question analysis,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna use how the query was generated,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna use the passage itself,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re gonna use the candidate answer</p>
<p>that was generated, and you&rsquo;re gonna score that.</p>
<p>So now we have a group of researchers</p>
<p>coming up with scores.</p>
<p>There are hundreds of different scores.</p>
<p>So now you&rsquo;re getting a fan out of it again</p>
<p>from however many candidate answers you have</p>
<p>to all the different scores.</p>
<p>So if you have 200 different scores</p>
<p>and you have a thousand candidates,</p>
<p>now you have 200,000 scores.</p>
<p>And so now you gotta figure out,</p>
<p>how do I now rank these answers</p>
<p>based on the scores that came back?</p>
<p>And I wanna rank them based on the likelihood</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re a correct answer to the question.</p>
<p>So every scorer was its own research project.</p>
<p>What do you mean by scorer?</p>
<p>So is that the annotation process</p>
<p>of basically a human being saying that this answer</p>
<p>has a quality of?</p>
<p>Think of it, if you wanna think of it,</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re doing, you know,</p>
<p>if you wanna think about what a human would be doing,</p>
<p>human would be looking at a possible answer,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;d be reading the, you know, Emily Dickinson,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;d be reading the passage in which that occurred,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;d be looking at the question,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;d be making a decision of how likely it is</p>
<p>that Emily Dickinson, given this evidence in this passage,</p>
<p>is the right answer to that question.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the annotation task.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the annotation process.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the scoring task.</p>
<p>But scoring implies zero to one kind of continuous.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>You give it a zero to one score.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not a binary.</p>
<p>No, you give it a score.</p>
<p>Give it a zero to, yeah, exactly, zero to one score.</p>
<p>But humans give different scores,</p>
<p>so you have to somehow normalize and all that kind of stuff</p>
<p>that deal with all that complexity.</p>
<p>It depends on what your strategy is.</p>
<p>We both, we&hellip;</p>
<p>It could be relative, too.</p>
<p>It could be&hellip;</p>
<p>We actually looked at the raw scores</p>
<p>as well as standardized scores,</p>
<p>because humans are not involved in this.</p>
<p>Humans are not involved.</p>
<p>Sorry, so I&rsquo;m misunderstanding the process here.</p>
<p>This is passages.</p>
<p>Where is the ground truth coming from?</p>
<p>Ground truth is only the answers to the questions.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s end to end.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s end to end.</p>
<p>So I was always driving end to end performance.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very interesting, a very interesting</p>
<p>engineering approach,</p>
<p>and ultimately scientific research approach,</p>
<p>always driving end to end.</p>
<p>Now, that&rsquo;s not to say</p>
<p>we wouldn&rsquo;t make hypotheses</p>
<p>that individual component performance</p>
<p>was related in some way to end to end performance.</p>
<p>Of course we would,</p>
<p>because people would have to build individual components.</p>
<p>But ultimately, to get your component integrated</p>
<p>to the system, you have to show impact</p>
<p>on end to end performance, question answering performance.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s many very smart people working on this,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re basically trying to sell their ideas</p>
<p>as a component that should be part of the system.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>And they would do research on their component,</p>
<p>and they would say things like,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna improve this as a candidate generator,</p>
<p>or I&rsquo;m gonna improve this as a question score,</p>
<p>or as a passive scorer,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna improve this, or as a parser,</p>
<p>and I can improve it by 2% on its component metric,</p>
<p>like a better parse, or a better candidate,</p>
<p>or a better type estimation, whatever it is.</p>
<p>And then I would say,</p>
<p>I need to understand how the improvement</p>
<p>on that component metric</p>
<p>is gonna affect the end to end performance.</p>
<p>If you can&rsquo;t estimate that,</p>
<p>and can&rsquo;t do experiments to demonstrate that,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t get in.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like the best run AI project I&rsquo;ve ever heard.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s awesome.</p>
<p>Okay, what breakthrough would you say,</p>
<p>like, I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s a lot of day to day breakthroughs,</p>
<p>but was there like a breakthrough</p>
<p>that really helped improve performance?</p>
<p>Like where people began to believe,</p>
<p>or is it just a gradual process?</p>
<p>Well, I think it was a gradual process,</p>
<p>but one of the things that I think gave people confidence</p>
<p>that we can get there was that,</p>
<p>as we follow this procedure of different ideas,</p>
<p>build different components,</p>
<p>plug them into the architecture,</p>
<p>run the system, see how we do,</p>
<p>do the error analysis,</p>
<p>start off new research projects to improve things.</p>
<p>And the very important idea</p>
<p>that the individual component work</p>
<p>did not have to deeply understand everything</p>
<p>that was going on with every other component.</p>
<p>And this is where we leverage machine learning</p>
<p>in a very important way.</p>
<p>So while individual components</p>
<p>could be statistically driven machine learning components,</p>
<p>some of them were heuristic,</p>
<p>some of them were machine learning components,</p>
<p>the system has a whole combined all the scores</p>
<p>using machine learning.</p>
<p>This was critical because that way</p>
<p>you can divide and conquer.</p>
<p>So you can say, okay, you work on your candidate generator,</p>
<p>or you work on this approach to answer scoring,</p>
<p>you work on this approach to type scoring,</p>
<p>you work on this approach to passage search</p>
<p>or to pass a selection and so forth.</p>
<p>But when we just plug it in,</p>
<p>and we had enough training data to say,</p>
<p>now we can train and figure out</p>
<p>how do we weigh all the scores relative to each other</p>
<p>based on the predicting the outcome,</p>
<p>which is right or wrong on Jeopardy.</p>
<p>And we had enough training data to do that.</p>
<p>So this enabled people to work independently</p>
<p>and to let the machine learning do the integration.</p>
<p>Beautiful, so yeah, the machine learning</p>
<p>is doing the fusion,</p>
<p>and then it&rsquo;s a human orchestrated ensemble</p>
<p>of different approaches.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>Still impressive that you were able</p>
<p>to get it done in a few years.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not obvious to me that it&rsquo;s doable,</p>
<p>if I just put myself in that mindset.</p>
<p>But when you look back at the Jeopardy challenge,</p>
<p>again, when you&rsquo;re looking up at the stars,</p>
<p>what are you most proud of, looking back at those days?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m most proud of my,</p>
<p>my commitment and my team&rsquo;s commitment</p>
<p>to be true to the science,</p>
<p>to not be afraid to fail.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s beautiful because there&rsquo;s so much pressure,</p>
<p>because it is a public event, it is a public show,</p>
<p>that you were dedicated to the idea.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Do you think it was a success?</p>
<p>In the eyes of the world, it was a success.</p>
<p>By your, I&rsquo;m sure, exceptionally high standards,</p>
<p>is there something you regret you would do differently?</p>
<p>It was a success.</p>
<p>It was a success for our goal.</p>
<p>Our goal was to build the most advanced</p>
<p>open domain question answering system.</p>
<p>We went back to the old problems</p>
<p>that we used to try to solve,</p>
<p>and we did dramatically better on all of them,</p>
<p>as well as we beat Jeopardy.</p>
<p>So we won at Jeopardy.</p>
<p>So it was a success.</p>
<p>It was, I worry that the community</p>
<p>or the world would not understand it as a success</p>
<p>because it came down to only one game.</p>
<p>And I knew statistically speaking,</p>
<p>this can be a huge technical success,</p>
<p>and we could still lose that one game.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a whole nother theme of this, of the journey.</p>
<p>But it was a success.</p>
<p>It was not a success in natural language understanding,</p>
<p>but that was not the goal.</p>
<p>Yeah, that was, but I would argue,</p>
<p>I understand what you&rsquo;re saying</p>
<p>in terms of the science,</p>
<p>but I would argue that the inspiration of it, right?</p>
<p>The, not a success in terms of solving</p>
<p>natural language understanding.</p>
<p>There was a success of being an inspiration</p>
<p>to future challenges.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>That drive future efforts.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the difference between how human being</p>
<p>compete in Jeopardy and how Watson does it?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s important in terms of intelligence.</p>
<p>Yeah, so that actually came up very early on</p>
<p>in the project also.</p>
<p>In fact, I had people who wanted to be on the project</p>
<p>who were early on, who sort of approached me</p>
<p>once I committed to do it,</p>
<p>had wanted to think about how humans do it.</p>
<p>And they were, from a cognition perspective,</p>
<p>like human cognition and how that should play.</p>
<p>And I would not take them on the project</p>
<p>because another assumption or another stake</p>
<p>I put in the ground was,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really care how humans do this.</p>
<p>At least in the context of this project.</p>
<p>I need to build in the context of this project.</p>
<p>In NLU and in building an AI that understands</p>
<p>how it needs to ultimately communicate with humans,</p>
<p>I very much care.</p>
<p>So it wasn&rsquo;t that I didn&rsquo;t care in general.</p>
<p>In fact, as an AI scientist, I care a lot about that,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m also a practical engineer</p>
<p>and I committed to getting this thing done</p>
<p>and I wasn&rsquo;t gonna get distracted.</p>
<p>I had to kind of say, like, if I&rsquo;m gonna get this done,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna chart this path.</p>
<p>And this path says, we&rsquo;re gonna engineer a machine</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s gonna get this thing done.</p>
<p>And we know what search and NLP can do.</p>
<p>We have to build on that foundation.</p>
<p>If I come in and take a different approach</p>
<p>and start wondering about how the human mind</p>
<p>might or might not do this,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not gonna get there from here in the timeframe.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a great way to lead the team.</p>
<p>But now that it&rsquo;s done and there&rsquo;s one,</p>
<p>when you look back, analyze what&rsquo;s the difference actually.</p>
<p>So I was a little bit surprised actually</p>
<p>to discover over time, as this would come up</p>
<p>from time to time and we&rsquo;d reflect on it,</p>
<p>and talking to Ken Jennings a little bit</p>
<p>and hearing Ken Jennings talk about</p>
<p>how he answered questions,</p>
<p>that it might&rsquo;ve been closer to the way humans</p>
<p>answer questions than I might&rsquo;ve imagined previously.</p>
<p>Because humans are probably in the game of Jeopardy!</p>
<p>at the level of Ken Jennings,</p>
<p>are probably also cheating their way to winning, right?</p>
<p>Not cheating, but shallow.</p>
<p>Well, they&rsquo;re doing shallow analysis.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re doing the fastest possible.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re doing shallow analysis.</p>
<p>So they are very quickly analyzing the question</p>
<p>and coming up with some key vectors or cues, if you will.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re taking those cues</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re very quickly going through</p>
<p>like their library of stuff,</p>
<p>not deeply reasoning about what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>And then sort of like a lots of different,</p>
<p>like what we would call these scores,</p>
<p>would kind of score that in a very shallow way</p>
<p>and then say, oh, boom, you know, that&rsquo;s what it is.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s interesting as we reflected on that.</p>
<p>So we may be doing something that&rsquo;s not too far off</p>
<p>from the way humans do it,</p>
<p>but we certainly didn&rsquo;t approach it by saying,</p>
<p>how would a human do this?</p>
<p>Now in elemental cognition,</p>
<p>like the project I&rsquo;m leading now,</p>
<p>we ask those questions all the time</p>
<p>because ultimately we&rsquo;re trying to do something</p>
<p>that is to make the intelligence of the machine</p>
<p>and the intelligence of the human very compatible.</p>
<p>Well, compatible in the sense</p>
<p>they can communicate with one another</p>
<p>and they can reason with this shared understanding.</p>
<p>So how they think about things and how they build answers,</p>
<p>how they build explanations</p>
<p>becomes a very important question to consider.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the difference between this open domain,</p>
<p>but cold constructed question answering of Jeopardy</p>
<p>and more something that requires understanding</p>
<p>for shared communication with humans and machines?</p>
<p>Yeah, well, this goes back to the interpretation</p>
<p>of what we were talking about before.</p>
<p>Jeopardy, the system&rsquo;s not trying to interpret the question</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not interpreting the content it&rsquo;s reusing</p>
<p>with regard to any particular framework.</p>
<p>I mean, it is parsing it and parsing the content</p>
<p>and using grammatical cues and stuff like that.</p>
<p>So if you think of grammar as a human framework</p>
<p>in some sense, it has that,</p>
<p>but when you get into the richer semantic frameworks,</p>
<p>what do people, how do they think, what motivates them,</p>
<p>what are the events that are occurring</p>
<p>and why are they occurring</p>
<p>and what causes what else to happen</p>
<p>and where are things in time and space?</p>
<p>And like when you start thinking about how humans formulate</p>
<p>and structure the knowledge that they acquire in their head</p>
<p>and wasn&rsquo;t doing any of that.</p>
<p>What do you think are the essential challenges</p>
<p>of like free flowing communication, free flowing dialogue</p>
<p>versus question answering even with the framework</p>
<p>of the interpretation dialogue?</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>Do you see free flowing dialogue</p>
<p>as a fundamentally more difficult than question answering</p>
<p>even with shared interpretation?</p>
<p>So dialogue is important in a number of different ways.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s a challenge.</p>
<p>So first of all, when I think about the machine that,</p>
<p>when I think about a machine that understands language</p>
<p>and ultimately can reason in an objective way</p>
<p>that can take the information that it perceives</p>
<p>through language or other means</p>
<p>and connect it back to these frameworks,</p>
<p>reason and explain itself,</p>
<p>that system ultimately needs to be able to talk to humans</p>
<p>or it needs to be able to interact with humans.</p>
<p>So in some sense it needs to dialogue.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t mean that it,</p>
<p>sometimes people talk about dialogue and they think,</p>
<p>you know, how do humans talk to like,</p>
<p>talk to each other in a casual conversation</p>
<p>and you can mimic casual conversations.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not trying to mimic casual conversations.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re really trying to produce a machine</p>
<p>whose goal is to help you think</p>
<p>and help you reason about your answers and explain why.</p>
<p>So instead of like talking to your friend down the street</p>
<p>about having a small talk conversation</p>
<p>with your friend down the street,</p>
<p>this is more about like you would be communicating</p>
<p>to the computer on Star Trek</p>
<p>where like, what do you wanna think about?</p>
<p>Like, what do you wanna reason about?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna tell you the information I have.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna have to summarize it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna ask you questions.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re gonna answer those questions.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna go back and forth with you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna figure out what your mental model is.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna now relate that to the information I have</p>
<p>and present it to you in a way that you can understand it</p>
<p>and then we could ask followup questions.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s that type of dialogue that you wanna construct.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more structured, it&rsquo;s more goal oriented,</p>
<p>but it needs to be fluid.</p>
<p>In other words, it has to be engaging and fluid.</p>
<p>It has to be productive and not distracting.</p>
<p>So there has to be a model of,</p>
<p>in other words, the machine has to have a model</p>
<p>of how humans think through things and discuss them.</p>
<p>So basically a productive, rich conversation</p>
<p>unlike this podcast.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to think it&rsquo;s more similar to this podcast.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t joking.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll ask you about humor as well, actually.</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s the hardest part of that?</p>
<p>Because it seems we&rsquo;re quite far away</p>
<p>as a community from that still to be able to,</p>
<p>so one is having a shared understanding.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, I think, a lot of the stuff you said</p>
<p>with frameworks is quite brilliant.</p>
<p>But just creating a smooth discourse.</p>
<p>It feels clunky right now.</p>
<p>Which aspects of this whole problem</p>
<p>that you just specified of having</p>
<p>a productive conversation is the hardest?</p>
<p>And that we&rsquo;re, or maybe any aspect of it</p>
<p>you can comment on because it&rsquo;s so shrouded in mystery.</p>
<p>So I think to do this you kind of have to be creative</p>
<p>in the following sense.</p>
<p>If I were to do this as purely a machine learning approach</p>
<p>and someone said learn how to have a good,</p>
<p>fluent, structured knowledge acquisition conversation,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d go out and say, okay, I have to collect</p>
<p>a bunch of data of people doing that.</p>
<p>People reasoning well, having a good, structured</p>
<p>conversation that both acquires knowledge efficiently</p>
<p>as well as produces answers and explanations</p>
<p>as part of the process.</p>
<p>And you struggle.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>To collect the data.</p>
<p>To collect the data because I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>how much data is like that.</p>
<p>Okay, there&rsquo;s one, there&rsquo;s a humorous commentary</p>
<p>on the lack of rational discourse.</p>
<p>But also even if it&rsquo;s out there, say it was out there,</p>
<p>how do you actually annotate, like how do you collect</p>
<p>an accessible example?</p>
<p>Right, so I think any problem like this</p>
<p>where you don&rsquo;t have enough data to represent</p>
<p>the phenomenon you want to learn,</p>
<p>in other words you want, if you have enough data</p>
<p>you could potentially learn the pattern.</p>
<p>In an example like this it&rsquo;s hard to do.</p>
<p>This is sort of a human sort of thing to do.</p>
<p>What recently came out at IBM was the debater projects</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s interesting, right, because now you do have</p>
<p>these structured dialogues, these debate things</p>
<p>where they did use machine learning techniques</p>
<p>to generate these debates.</p>
<p>Dialogues are a little bit tougher in my opinion</p>
<p>than generating a structured argument</p>
<p>where you have lots of other structured arguments</p>
<p>like this, you could potentially annotate that data</p>
<p>and you could say this is a good response,</p>
<p>this is a bad response in a particular domain.</p>
<p>Here I have to be responsive and I have to be opportunistic</p>
<p>with regard to what is the human saying.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m goal oriented in saying I want to solve the problem,</p>
<p>I want to acquire the knowledge necessary,</p>
<p>but I also have to be opportunistic and responsive</p>
<p>to what the human is saying.</p>
<p>So I think that it&rsquo;s not clear that we could just train</p>
<p>on the body of data to do this, but we could bootstrap it.</p>
<p>In other words, we can be creative and we could say,</p>
<p>what do we think the structure of a good dialogue is</p>
<p>that does this well?</p>
<p>And we can start to create that.</p>
<p>If we can create that more programmatically,</p>
<p>at least to get this process started</p>
<p>and I can create a tool that now engages humans effectively,</p>
<p>I could start generating data,</p>
<p>I could start the human learning process</p>
<p>and I can update my machine,</p>
<p>but I could also start the automatic learning process</p>
<p>as well, but I have to understand</p>
<p>what features to even learn over.</p>
<p>So I have to bootstrap the process a little bit first.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a creative design task</p>
<p>that I could then use as input</p>
<p>into a more automatic learning task.</p>
<p>So some creativity in bootstrapping.</p>
<p>What elements of a conversation</p>
<p>do you think you would like to see?</p>
<p>So one of the benchmarks for me is humor, right?</p>
<p>That seems to be one of the hardest.</p>
<p>And to me, the biggest contrast is sort of Watson.</p>
<p>So one of the greatest sketches,</p>
<p>comedy sketches of all time, right,</p>
<p>is the SNL celebrity Jeopardy</p>
<p>with Alex Trebek and Sean Connery</p>
<p>and Burt Reynolds and so on,</p>
<p>with Sean Connery commentating on Alex Trebek&rsquo;s</p>
<p>while they&rsquo;re alive.</p>
<p>And I think all of them are in the negative pointwise.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re clearly all losing</p>
<p>in terms of the game of Jeopardy,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re winning in terms of comedy.</p>
<p>So what do you think about humor in this whole interaction</p>
<p>in the dialogue that&rsquo;s productive?</p>
<p>Or even just what humor represents to me</p>
<p>is the same idea that you&rsquo;re saying about framework,</p>
<p>because humor only exists</p>
<p>within a particular human framework.</p>
<p>So what do you think about humor?</p>
<p>What do you think about things like humor</p>
<p>that connect to the kind of creativity</p>
<p>you mentioned that&rsquo;s needed?</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a couple of things going on there.</p>
<p>So I sort of feel like,</p>
<p>and I might be too optimistic this way,</p>
<p>but I think that there are,</p>
<p>we did a little bit about with puns in Jeopardy.</p>
<p>We literally sat down and said,</p>
<p>how do puns work?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like wordplay,</p>
<p>and you could formalize these things.</p>
<p>So I think there&rsquo;s a lot aspects of humor</p>
<p>that you could formalize.</p>
<p>You could also learn humor.</p>
<p>You could just say, what do people laugh at?</p>
<p>And if you have enough, again,</p>
<p>if you have enough data to represent the phenomenon,</p>
<p>you might be able to weigh the features</p>
<p>and figure out what humans find funny</p>
<p>and what they don&rsquo;t find funny.</p>
<p>The machine might not be able to explain</p>
<p>why the human is funny unless we sit back</p>
<p>and think about that more formally.</p>
<p>I think, again, I think you do a combination of both.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m always a big proponent of that.</p>
<p>I think robust architectures and approaches</p>
<p>are always a little bit combination of us reflecting</p>
<p>and being creative about how things are structured,</p>
<p>how to formalize them,</p>
<p>and then taking advantage of large data and doing learning</p>
<p>and figuring out how to combine these two approaches.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s another aspect to humor though,</p>
<p>which goes to the idea that I feel like I can relate</p>
<p>to the person telling the story.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s an interesting theme</p>
<p>in the whole AI theme,</p>
<p>which is, do I feel differently when I know it&rsquo;s a robot?</p>
<p>And when I imagine that the robot is not conscious</p>
<p>the way I&rsquo;m conscious,</p>
<p>when I imagine the robot does not actually</p>
<p>have the experiences that I experience,</p>
<p>do I find it funny?</p>
<p>Or do, because it&rsquo;s not as related,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t imagine that the person&rsquo;s relating it to it</p>
<p>the way I relate to it.</p>
<p>I think this also, you see this in the arts</p>
<p>and in entertainment where,</p>
<p>sometimes you have savants who are remarkable at a thing,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s sculpture or it&rsquo;s music or whatever,</p>
<p>but the people who get the most attention</p>
<p>are the people who can evoke a similar emotional response,</p>
<p>who can get you to emote, right?</p>
<p>About the way they are.</p>
<p>In other words, who can basically make the connection</p>
<p>from the artifact, from the music or the painting</p>
<p>of the sculpture to the emotion</p>
<p>and get you to share that emotion with them.</p>
<p>And then, and that&rsquo;s when it becomes compelling.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re communicating at a whole different level.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just not communicating the artifact.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re communicating their emotional response</p>
<p>to the artifact.</p>
<p>And then you feel like, oh wow,</p>
<p>I can relate to that person, I can connect to that,</p>
<p>I can connect to that person.</p>
<p>So I think humor has that aspect as well.</p>
<p>So the idea that you can connect to that person,</p>
<p>person being the critical thing,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re also able to anthropomorphize objects pretty,</p>
<p>robots and AI systems pretty well.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re almost looking to make them human.</p>
<p>So maybe from your experience with Watson,</p>
<p>maybe you can comment on, did you consider that as part,</p>
<p>well, obviously the problem of jeopardy</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t require anthropomorphization, but nevertheless.</p>
<p>Well, there was some interest in doing that.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s another thing I didn&rsquo;t want to do</p>
<p>because I didn&rsquo;t want to distract</p>
<p>from the actual scientific task.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re absolutely right.</p>
<p>I mean, humans do anthropomorphize</p>
<p>and without necessarily a lot of work.</p>
<p>I mean, you just put some eyes</p>
<p>and a couple of eyebrow movements</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re getting humans to react emotionally.</p>
<p>And I think you can do that.</p>
<p>So I didn&rsquo;t mean to suggest that,</p>
<p>that that connection cannot be mimicked.</p>
<p>I think that connection can be mimicked</p>
<p>and can produce that emotional response.</p>
<p>I just wonder though, if you&rsquo;re told what&rsquo;s really going on,</p>
<p>if you know that the machine is not conscious,</p>
<p>not having the same richness of emotional reactions</p>
<p>and understanding that it doesn&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>share the understanding,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s essentially just moving its eyebrow</p>
<p>or drooping its eyes or making them bigger,</p>
<p>whatever it&rsquo;s doing, just getting the emotional response,</p>
<p>will you still feel it?</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>I think you probably would for a while.</p>
<p>And then when it becomes more important</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a deeper share of understanding,</p>
<p>it may run flat, but I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pretty confident that majority of the world,</p>
<p>even if you tell them how it works,</p>
<p>well, it will not matter,</p>
<p>especially if the machine herself says that she is conscious.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s very possible.</p>
<p>So you, the scientist that made the machine is saying</p>
<p>that this is how the algorithm works.</p>
<p>Everybody will just assume you&rsquo;re lying</p>
<p>and that there&rsquo;s a conscious being there.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re deep into the science fiction genre now,</p>
<p>but yeah.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s actually psychology.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s not science fiction.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s reality.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a really powerful one</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ll have to be exploring in the next few decades.</p>
<p>I agree.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very interesting element of intelligence.</p>
<p>So what do you think,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve talked about social constructs of intelligences</p>
<p>and frameworks and the way humans</p>
<p>kind of interpret information.</p>
<p>What do you think is a good test of intelligence</p>
<p>in your view?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s the Alan Turing with the Turing test.</p>
<p>Watson accomplished something very impressive with Jeopardy.</p>
<p>What do you think is a test</p>
<p>that would impress the heck out of you</p>
<p>that you saw that a computer could do?</p>
<p>They would say, this is crossing a kind of threshold</p>
<p>that gives me pause in a good way.</p>
<p>My expectations for AI are generally high.</p>
<p>What does high look like by the way?</p>
<p>So not the threshold, test is a threshold.</p>
<p>What do you think is the destination?</p>
<p>What do you think is the ceiling?</p>
<p>I think machines will in many measures</p>
<p>will be better than us, will become more effective.</p>
<p>In other words, better predictors about a lot of things</p>
<p>than ultimately we can do.</p>
<p>I think where they&rsquo;re gonna struggle</p>
<p>is what we talked about before,</p>
<p>which is relating to communicating with</p>
<p>and understanding humans in deeper ways.</p>
<p>And so I think that&rsquo;s a key point,</p>
<p>like we can create the super parrot.</p>
<p>What I mean by the super parrot is given enough data,</p>
<p>a machine can mimic your emotional response,</p>
<p>can even generate language that will sound smart</p>
<p>and what someone else might say under similar circumstances.</p>
<p>Like I would just pause on that,</p>
<p>like that&rsquo;s the super parrot, right?</p>
<p>So given similar circumstances,</p>
<p>moves its faces in similar ways,</p>
<p>changes its tone of voice in similar ways,</p>
<p>produces strings of language that would similar</p>
<p>that a human might say,</p>
<p>not necessarily being able to produce</p>
<p>a logical interpretation or understanding</p>
<p>that would ultimately satisfy a critical interrogation</p>
<p>or a critical understanding.</p>
<p>I think you just described me in a nutshell.</p>
<p>So I think philosophically speaking,</p>
<p>you could argue that that&rsquo;s all we&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>as human beings to work super parrots.</p>
<p>So I was gonna say, it&rsquo;s very possible,</p>
<p>you know, humans do behave that way too.</p>
<p>And so upon deeper probing and deeper interrogation,</p>
<p>you may find out that there isn&rsquo;t a shared understanding</p>
<p>because I think humans do both.</p>
<p>Like humans are statistical language model machines</p>
<p>and they are capable reasoners.</p>
<p>You know, they&rsquo;re both.</p>
<p>And you don&rsquo;t know which is going on, right?</p>
<p>So, and I think it&rsquo;s an interesting problem.</p>
<p>We talked earlier about like where we are</p>
<p>in our social and political landscape.</p>
<p>Can you distinguish someone who can string words together</p>
<p>and sound like they know what they&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>from someone who actually does?</p>
<p>Can you do that without dialogue,</p>
<p>without interrogative or probing dialogue?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s interesting because humans are really good</p>
<p>in their own mind, justifying or explaining what they hear</p>
<p>because they project their understanding onto yours.</p>
<p>So you could say, you could put together a string of words</p>
<p>and someone will sit there and interpret it</p>
<p>in a way that&rsquo;s extremely biased</p>
<p>to the way they wanna interpret it.</p>
<p>They wanna assume that you&rsquo;re an idiot</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll interpret it one way.</p>
<p>They will assume you&rsquo;re a genius</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll interpret it another way that suits their needs.</p>
<p>So this is tricky business.</p>
<p>So I think to answer your question,</p>
<p>as AI gets better and better, better and better mimic,</p>
<p>you recreate the super parrots,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re challenged just as we are with,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re challenged with humans.</p>
<p>Do you really know what you&rsquo;re talking about?</p>
<p>Do you have a meaningful interpretation,</p>
<p>a powerful framework that you could reason over</p>
<p>and justify your answers, justify your predictions</p>
<p>and your beliefs, why you think they make sense.</p>
<p>Can you convince me what the implications are?</p>
<p>So can you reason intelligently and make me believe</p>
<p>that the implications of your prediction and so forth?</p>
<p>So what happens is it becomes reflective.</p>
<p>My standard for judging your intelligence</p>
<p>depends a lot on mine.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re saying there should be a large group of people</p>
<p>with a certain standard of intelligence</p>
<p>that would be convinced by this particular AI system.</p>
<p>Then they&rsquo;ll pass.</p>
<p>There should be, but I think depending on the content,</p>
<p>one of the problems we have there</p>
<p>is that if that large community of people</p>
<p>are not judging it with regard to a rigorous standard</p>
<p>of objective logic and reason, you still have a problem.</p>
<p>Like masses of people can be persuaded.</p>
<p>The millennials, yeah.</p>
<p>To turn their brains off.</p>
<p>Right, okay.</p>
<p>Sorry.</p>
<p>By the way, I have nothing against the millennials.</p>
<p>No, I don&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;m just, just.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re a part of one of the great benchmarks,</p>
<p>challenges of AI history.</p>
<p>What do you think about AlphaZero, OpenAI5,</p>
<p>AlphaStar accomplishments on video games recently,</p>
<p>which are also, I think, at least in the case of Go,</p>
<p>with AlphaGo and AlphaZero playing Go,</p>
<p>was a monumental accomplishment as well.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts about that challenge?</p>
<p>I think it was a giant landmark for AI.</p>
<p>I think it was phenomenal.</p>
<p>I mean, it was one of those other things</p>
<p>nobody thought like solving Go was gonna be easy,</p>
<p>particularly because it&rsquo;s hard for,</p>
<p>particularly hard for humans.</p>
<p>Hard for humans to learn, hard for humans to excel at.</p>
<p>And so it was another measure, a measure of intelligence.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very cool.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s very interesting what they did.</p>
<p>And I loved how they solved the data problem,</p>
<p>which again, they bootstrapped it</p>
<p>and got the machine to play itself,</p>
<p>to generate enough data to learn from.</p>
<p>I think that was brilliant.</p>
<p>I think that was great.</p>
<p>And of course, the result speaks for itself.</p>
<p>I think it makes us think about,</p>
<p>again, it is, okay, what&rsquo;s intelligence?</p>
<p>What aspects of intelligence are important?</p>
<p>Can the Go machine help me make me a better Go player?</p>
<p>Is it an alien intelligence?</p>
<p>Am I even capable of,</p>
<p>like again, if we put in very simple terms,</p>
<p>it found the function, it found the Go function.</p>
<p>Can I even comprehend the Go function?</p>
<p>Can I talk about the Go function?</p>
<p>Can I conceptualize the Go function,</p>
<p>like whatever it might be?</p>
<p>So one of the interesting ideas of that system</p>
<p>is that it plays against itself, right?</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s no human in the loop there.</p>
<p>So like you&rsquo;re saying, it could have by itself</p>
<p>created an alien intelligence.</p>
<p>How?</p>
<p>Toward a Go, imagine you&rsquo;re sentencing,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re a judge and you&rsquo;re sentencing people,</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re setting policy,</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re making medical decisions,</p>
<p>and you can&rsquo;t explain,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t get anybody to understand</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re doing or why.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s an interesting dilemma</p>
<p>for the applications of AI.</p>
<p>Do we hold AI to this accountability</p>
<p>that says humans have to be willing</p>
<p>to take responsibility for the decision?</p>
<p>In other words, can you explain why you would do the thing?</p>
<p>Will you get up and speak to other humans</p>
<p>and convince them that this was a smart decision?</p>
<p>Is the AI enabling you to do that?</p>
<p>Can you get behind the logic that was made there?</p>
<p>Do you think, sorry to land on this point,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a fascinating one.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a great goal for AI.</p>
<p>Do you think it&rsquo;s achievable in many cases?</p>
<p>Or, okay, there&rsquo;s two possible worlds</p>
<p>that we have in the future.</p>
<p>One is where AI systems do like medical diagnosis</p>
<p>or things like that, or drive a car</p>
<p>without ever explaining to you why it fails when it does.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one possible world and we&rsquo;re okay with it.</p>
<p>Or the other where we are not okay with it</p>
<p>and we really hold back the technology</p>
<p>from getting too good before it&rsquo;s able to explain.</p>
<p>Which of those worlds are more likely, do you think,</p>
<p>and which are concerning to you or not?</p>
<p>I think the reality is it&rsquo;s gonna be a mix.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure I have a problem with that.</p>
<p>I mean, I think there are tasks that are perfectly fine</p>
<p>with machines show a certain level of performance</p>
<p>and that level of performance is already better than humans.</p>
<p>So for example, I don&rsquo;t know that I take driverless cars.</p>
<p>If driverless cars learn how to be more effective drivers</p>
<p>than humans but can&rsquo;t explain what they&rsquo;re doing,</p>
<p>but bottom line, statistically speaking,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re 10 times safer than humans,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know that I care.</p>
<p>I think when we have these edge cases</p>
<p>when something bad happens and we wanna decide</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s liable for that thing and who made that mistake</p>
<p>and what do we do about that?</p>
<p>And I think those edge cases are interesting cases.</p>
<p>And now do we go to designers of the AI</p>
<p>and the AI says, I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s what it learned</p>
<p>to do and it says, well, you didn&rsquo;t train it properly.</p>
<p>You were negligent in the training data</p>
<p>that you gave that machine.</p>
<p>Like, how do we drive down the reliability?</p>
<p>So I think those are interesting questions.</p>
<p>So the optimization problem there, sorry,</p>
<p>is to create an AI system that&rsquo;s able</p>
<p>to explain the lawyers away.</p>
<p>There you go.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s gonna be interesting.</p>
<p>I mean, I think this is where technology</p>
<p>and social discourse are gonna get like deeply intertwined</p>
<p>and how we start thinking about problems, decisions</p>
<p>and problems like that.</p>
<p>I think in other cases it becomes more obvious</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s like, why did you decide</p>
<p>to give that person a longer sentence or deny them parole?</p>
<p>Again, policy decisions or why did you pick that treatment?</p>
<p>Like that treatment ended up killing that guy.</p>
<p>Like, why was that a reasonable choice to make?</p>
<p>And people are gonna demand explanations.</p>
<p>Now there&rsquo;s a reality though here.</p>
<p>And the reality is that it&rsquo;s not,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure humans are making reasonable choices</p>
<p>when they do these things.</p>
<p>They are using statistical hunches, biases,</p>
<p>or even systematically using statistical averages</p>
<p>to make calls.</p>
<p>This is what happened to my dad</p>
<p>and if you saw the talk I gave about that.</p>
<p>But they decided that my father was brain dead.</p>
<p>He had went into cardiac arrest</p>
<p>and it took a long time for the ambulance to get there</p>
<p>and he was not resuscitated right away and so forth.</p>
<p>And they came and they told me he was brain dead</p>
<p>and why was he brain dead?</p>
<p>Because essentially they gave me</p>
<p>a purely statistical argument under these conditions</p>
<p>with these four features, 98% chance he&rsquo;s brain dead.</p>
<p>I said, but can you just tell me not inductively,</p>
<p>but deductively go there and tell me</p>
<p>his brain&rsquo;s not functioning is the way for you to do that.</p>
<p>And the protocol in response was,</p>
<p>no, this is how we make this decision.</p>
<p>I said, this is inadequate for me.</p>
<p>I understand the statistics and I don&rsquo;t know how,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a 2% chance he&rsquo;s still alive.</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t know the specifics.</p>
<p>I need the specifics of this case</p>
<p>and I want the deductive logical argument</p>
<p>about why you actually know he&rsquo;s brain dead.</p>
<p>So I wouldn&rsquo;t sign the do not resuscitate.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know, it was like they went through</p>
<p>lots of procedures, it was a big long story,</p>
<p>but the bottom was a fascinating story by the way,</p>
<p>but how I reasoned and how the doctors reasoned</p>
<p>through this whole process.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t know, somewhere around 24 hours later</p>
<p>or something, he was sitting up in bed</p>
<p>with zero brain damage.</p>
<p>I mean, what lessons do you draw from that story,</p>
<p>that experience?</p>
<p>That the data that&rsquo;s being used</p>
<p>to make statistical inferences</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t adequately reflect the phenomenon.</p>
<p>So in other words, you&rsquo;re getting shit wrong,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, but you&rsquo;re getting stuff wrong</p>
<p>because your model is not robust enough</p>
<p>and you might be better off not using statistical inference</p>
<p>and statistical averages in certain cases</p>
<p>when you know the model&rsquo;s insufficient</p>
<p>and that you should be reasoning about the specific case</p>
<p>more logically and more deductibly</p>
<p>and hold yourself responsible</p>
<p>and hold yourself accountable to doing that.</p>
<p>And perhaps AI has a role to say the exact thing</p>
<p>what you just said, which is perhaps this is a case</p>
<p>you should think for yourself,</p>
<p>you should reason deductively.</p>
<p>Well, so it&rsquo;s hard because it&rsquo;s hard to know that.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d have to go back and you&rsquo;d have to have enough data</p>
<p>to essentially say, and this goes back to how do we,</p>
<p>this goes back to the case of how do we decide</p>
<p>whether the AI is good enough to do a particular task</p>
<p>and regardless of whether or not</p>
<p>it produces an explanation.</p>
<p>And what standard do we hold for that?</p>
<p>So if you look more broadly, for example,</p>
<p>as my father, as a medical case,</p>
<p>the medical system ultimately helped him a lot</p>
<p>throughout his life, without it,</p>
<p>he probably would have died much sooner.</p>
<p>So overall, it sort of worked for him</p>
<p>in sort of a net, net kind of way.</p>
<p>Actually, I don&rsquo;t know that that&rsquo;s fair.</p>
<p>But maybe not in that particular case, but overall,</p>
<p>like the medical system overall does more good than bad.</p>
<p>Yeah, the medical system overall</p>
<p>was doing more good than bad.</p>
<p>Now, there&rsquo;s another argument that suggests</p>
<p>that wasn&rsquo;t the case, but for the sake of argument,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say like that&rsquo;s, let&rsquo;s say a net positive.</p>
<p>And I think you have to sit there and there</p>
<p>and take that into consideration.</p>
<p>Now you look at a particular use case,</p>
<p>like for example, making this decision,</p>
<p>have you done enough studies to know</p>
<p>how good that prediction really is?</p>
<p>And have you done enough studies to compare it,</p>
<p>to say, well, what if we dug in in a more direct,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s get the evidence, let&rsquo;s do the deductive thing</p>
<p>and not use statistics here,</p>
<p>how often would that have done better?</p>
<p>So you have to do the studies</p>
<p>to know how good the AI actually is.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s complicated because it depends how fast</p>
<p>you have to make the decision.</p>
<p>So if you have to make the decision super fast,</p>
<p>you have no choice.</p>
<p>If you have more time, right?</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re ready to pull the plug,</p>
<p>and this is a lot of the argument that I had with a doctor,</p>
<p>I said, what&rsquo;s he gonna do if you do it,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s gonna happen to him in that room if you do it my way?</p>
<p>You know, well, he&rsquo;s gonna die anyway.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s do it my way then.</p>
<p>I mean, it raises questions for our society</p>
<p>to struggle with, as the case with your father,</p>
<p>but also when things like race and gender</p>
<p>start coming into play when certain,</p>
<p>when judgments are made based on things</p>
<p>that are complicated in our society,</p>
<p>at least in the discourse.</p>
<p>And it starts, you know, I think I&rsquo;m safe to say</p>
<p>that most of the violent crimes committed</p>
<p>by males, so if you discriminate based,</p>
<p>you know, it&rsquo;s a male versus female saying that</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s a male, more likely to commit the crime.</p>
<p>This is one of my very positive and optimistic views</p>
<p>of why the study of artificial intelligence,</p>
<p>the process of thinking and reasoning logically</p>
<p>and statistically, and how to combine them</p>
<p>is so important for the discourse today,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s causing a, regardless of what state AI devices</p>
<p>are or not, it&rsquo;s causing this dialogue to happen.</p>
<p>This is one of the most important dialogues</p>
<p>that in my view, the human species can have right now,</p>
<p>which is how to think well, how to reason well,</p>
<p>how to understand our own cognitive biases</p>
<p>and what to do about them.</p>
<p>That has got to be one of the most important things</p>
<p>we as a species can be doing, honestly.</p>
<p>We are, we&rsquo;ve created an incredibly complex society.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve created amazing abilities to amplify noise faster</p>
<p>than we can amplify signal.</p>
<p>We are challenged.</p>
<p>We are deeply, deeply challenged.</p>
<p>We have, you know, big segments of the population</p>
<p>getting hit with enormous amounts of information.</p>
<p>Do they know how to do critical thinking?</p>
<p>Do they know how to objectively reason?</p>
<p>Do they understand what they are doing,</p>
<p>nevermind what their AI is doing?</p>
<p>This is such an important dialogue to be having.</p>
<p>And, you know, we are fundamentally,</p>
<p>our thinking can be and easily becomes fundamentally bias.</p>
<p>And there are statistics and we shouldn&rsquo;t blind our,</p>
<p>we shouldn&rsquo;t discard statistical inference,</p>
<p>but we should understand the nature</p>
<p>of statistical inference.</p>
<p>As a society, as you know,</p>
<p>we decide to reject statistical inference</p>
<p>to favor understanding and deciding on the individual.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>We consciously make that choice.</p>
<p>So even if the statistics said,</p>
<p>even if the statistics said males are more likely to have,</p>
<p>you know, to be violent criminals,</p>
<p>we still take each person as an individual</p>
<p>and we treat them based on the logic</p>
<p>and the knowledge of that situation.</p>
<p>We purposefully and intentionally</p>
<p>reject the statistical inference.</p>
<p>We do that out of respect for the individual.</p>
<p>For the individual.</p>
<p>Yeah, and that requires reasoning and thinking.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>Looking forward, what grand challenges</p>
<p>would you like to see in the future?</p>
<p>Because the Jeopardy challenge, you know,</p>
<p>captivated the world.</p>
<p>AlphaGo, AlphaZero captivated the world.</p>
<p>Deep Blue certainly beating Kasparov.</p>
<p>Gary&rsquo;s bitterness aside captivated the world.</p>
<p>What do you think, do you have ideas</p>
<p>for next grand challenges for future challenges of that?</p>
<p>You know, look, I mean, I think there are lots</p>
<p>of really great ideas for grand challenges.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m particularly focused on one right now,</p>
<p>which is, you know, can you demonstrate</p>
<p>that they understand, that they could read and understand,</p>
<p>that they can acquire these frameworks</p>
<p>and communicate, you know,</p>
<p>reason and communicate with humans.</p>
<p>So it is kind of like the Turing test,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a little bit more demanding than the Turing test.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not enough to convince me that you might be human</p>
<p>because you could, you know, you can parrot a conversation.</p>
<p>I think, you know, the standard is a little bit higher,</p>
<p>is for example, can you, you know, the standard is higher.</p>
<p>And I think one of the challenges</p>
<p>of devising this grand challenge is that we&rsquo;re not sure</p>
<p>what intelligence is, we&rsquo;re not sure how to determine</p>
<p>whether or not two people actually understand each other</p>
<p>and in what depth they understand it, you know,</p>
<p>to what depth they understand each other.</p>
<p>So the challenge becomes something along the lines of,</p>
<p>can you satisfy me that we have a shared understanding?</p>
<p>So if I were to probe and probe and you probe me,</p>
<p>can machines really act like thought partners</p>
<p>where they can satisfy me that we have a shared,</p>
<p>our understanding is shared enough</p>
<p>that we can collaborate and produce answers together</p>
<p>and that, you know, they can help me explain</p>
<p>and justify those answers.</p>
<p>So maybe here&rsquo;s an idea.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ll have AI system run for president and convince.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s too easy.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, go ahead.</p>
<p>Well, no, you have to convince the voters</p>
<p>that they should vote.</p>
<p>So like, I guess what does winning look like?</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s why I think this is such a challenge</p>
<p>because we go back to the emotional persuasion.</p>
<p>We go back to, you know, now we&rsquo;re checking off an aspect</p>
<p>of human cognition that is in many ways weak or flawed,</p>
<p>right, we&rsquo;re so easily manipulated.</p>
<p>Our minds are drawn for often the wrong reasons, right?</p>
<p>Not the reasons that ultimately matter to us,</p>
<p>but the reasons that can easily persuade us.</p>
<p>I think we can be persuaded to believe one thing or another</p>
<p>for reasons that ultimately don&rsquo;t serve us well</p>
<p>in the longterm.</p>
<p>And a good benchmark should not play with those elements</p>
<p>of emotional manipulation.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s where we have to set the higher standard</p>
<p>for ourselves of what, you know, what does it mean?</p>
<p>This goes back to rationality</p>
<p>and it goes back to objective thinking.</p>
<p>And can you produce, can you acquire information</p>
<p>and produce reasoned arguments</p>
<p>and to those reasoned arguments</p>
<p>pass a certain amount of muster and is it,</p>
<p>and can you acquire new knowledge?</p>
<p>You know, can you, for example, can you reason,</p>
<p>I have acquired new knowledge,</p>
<p>can you identify where it&rsquo;s consistent or contradictory</p>
<p>with other things you&rsquo;ve learned?</p>
<p>And can you explain that to me</p>
<p>and get me to understand that?</p>
<p>So I think another way to think about it perhaps</p>
<p>is can a machine teach you, can it help you understand</p>
<p>something that you didn&rsquo;t really understand before</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s taking you, so you&rsquo;re not,</p>
<p>again, it&rsquo;s almost like can it teach you,</p>
<p>can it help you learn and in an arbitrary space</p>
<p>so it can open those domain space?</p>
<p>So can you tell the machine, and again,</p>
<p>this borrows from some science fiction,</p>
<p>but can you go off and learn about this topic</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;d like to understand better</p>
<p>and then work with me to help me understand it?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s quite brilliant.</p>
<p>What, the machine that passes that kind of test,</p>
<p>do you think it would need to have self awareness</p>
<p>or even consciousness?</p>
<p>What do you think about consciousness</p>
<p>and the importance of it maybe in relation to having a body,</p>
<p>having a presence, an entity?</p>
<p>Do you think that&rsquo;s important?</p>
<p>You know, people used to ask me if Watson was conscious</p>
<p>and I used to say, he&rsquo;s conscious of what exactly?</p>
<p>I mean, I think, you know, maybe it depends</p>
<p>what it is that you&rsquo;re conscious of.</p>
<p>I mean, like, so, you know, did it, if you, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s certainly easy for it to answer questions</p>
<p>about, it would be trivial to program it</p>
<p>to answer questions about whether or not</p>
<p>it was playing Jeopardy.</p>
<p>I mean, it could certainly answer questions</p>
<p>that would imply that it was aware of things.</p>
<p>Exactly, what does it mean to be aware</p>
<p>and what does it mean to be conscious of?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sort of interesting.</p>
<p>I mean, I think that we differ from one another</p>
<p>based on what we&rsquo;re conscious of.</p>
<p>But wait, wait a minute, yes, for sure.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s degrees of consciousness in there, so.</p>
<p>Well, and there&rsquo;s just areas.</p>
<p>Like, it&rsquo;s not just degrees, what are you aware of?</p>
<p>Like, what are you not aware of?</p>
<p>But nevertheless, there&rsquo;s a very subjective element</p>
<p>to our experience.</p>
<p>Let me even not talk about consciousness.</p>
<p>Let me talk about another, to me,</p>
<p>really interesting topic of mortality, fear of mortality.</p>
<p>Watson, as far as I could tell,</p>
<p>did not have a fear of death.</p>
<p>Certainly not.</p>
<p>Most, most humans do.</p>
<p>Wasn&rsquo;t conscious of death.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t, yeah.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s an element of finiteness to our existence</p>
<p>that I think, like you mentioned, survival,</p>
<p>that adds to the whole thing.</p>
<p>I mean, consciousness is tied up with that,</p>
<p>that we are a thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a subjective thing that ends.</p>
<p>And that seems to add a color and flavor</p>
<p>to our motivations in a way</p>
<p>that seems to be fundamentally important for intelligence,</p>
<p>or at least the kind of human intelligence.</p>
<p>Well, I think for generating goals, again,</p>
<p>I think you could have,</p>
<p>you could have an intelligence capability</p>
<p>and a capability to learn, a capability to predict.</p>
<p>But I think without,</p>
<p>I mean, again, you get fear,</p>
<p>but essentially without the goal to survive.</p>
<p>So you think you can just encode that</p>
<p>without having to really?</p>
<p>I think you could encode.</p>
<p>I mean, you could create a robot now,</p>
<p>and you could say, you know, plug it in,</p>
<p>and say, protect your power source, you know,</p>
<p>and give it some capabilities,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;ll sit there and operate</p>
<p>to try to protect its power source and survive.</p>
<p>I mean, so I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s philosophically a hard thing to demonstrate.</p>
<p>It sounds like a fairly easy thing to demonstrate</p>
<p>that you can give it that goal.</p>
<p>Will it come up with that goal by itself?</p>
<p>I think you have to program that goal in.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s something,</p>
<p>because I think, as we touched on,</p>
<p>intelligence is kind of like a social construct.</p>
<p>The fact that a robot will be protecting its power source</p>
<p>would add depth and grounding to its intelligence</p>
<p>in terms of us being able to respect it.</p>
<p>I mean, ultimately, it boils down to us acknowledging</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s intelligent.</p>
<p>And the fact that it can die,</p>
<p>I think, is an important part of that.</p>
<p>The interesting thing to reflect on</p>
<p>is how trivial that would be.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think, if you knew how trivial that was,</p>
<p>you would associate that with being intelligence.</p>
<p>I mean, I literally put in a statement of code</p>
<p>that says you have the following actions you can take.</p>
<p>You give it a bunch of actions,</p>
<p>like maybe you mount a laser gun on it,</p>
<p>or you give it the ability to scream or screech or whatever.</p>
<p>And you say, if you see your power source threatened,</p>
<p>then you could program that in,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re gonna take these actions to protect it.</p>
<p>You know, you could train it on a bunch of things.</p>
<p>So, and now you&rsquo;re gonna look at that and you say,</p>
<p>well, you know, that&rsquo;s intelligence,</p>
<p>which is protecting its power source?</p>
<p>Maybe, but that&rsquo;s, again, this human bias that says,</p>
<p>the thing I identify, my intelligence and my conscious,</p>
<p>so fundamentally with the desire,</p>
<p>or at least the behaviors associated</p>
<p>with the desire to survive,</p>
<p>that if I see another thing doing that,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to assume it&rsquo;s intelligent.</p>
<p>What timeline, year,</p>
<p>will society have something that would,</p>
<p>that you would be comfortable calling</p>
<p>an artificial general intelligence system?</p>
<p>Well, what&rsquo;s your intuition?</p>
<p>Nobody can predict the future,</p>
<p>certainly not the next few months or 20 years away,</p>
<p>but what&rsquo;s your intuition?</p>
<p>How far away are we?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to make these predictions.</p>
<p>I mean, I would be guessing,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s so many different variables,</p>
<p>including just how much we want to invest in it</p>
<p>and how important we think it is,</p>
<p>what kind of investment we&rsquo;re willing to make in it,</p>
<p>what kind of talent we end up bringing to the table,</p>
<p>the incentive structure, all these things.</p>
<p>So I think it is possible to do this sort of thing.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s, I think trying to sort of</p>
<p>ignore many of the variables and things like that,</p>
<p>is it a 10 year thing, is it a 23 year?</p>
<p>Probably closer to a 20 year thing, I guess.</p>
<p>But not several hundred years.</p>
<p>No, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s several hundred years.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s several hundred years.</p>
<p>But again, so much depends on how committed we are</p>
<p>to investing and incentivizing this type of work.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s sort of interesting.</p>
<p>Like, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s obvious how incentivized we are.</p>
<p>I think from a task perspective,</p>
<p>if we see business opportunities to take this technique</p>
<p>or that technique to solve that problem,</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s the main driver for many of these things.</p>
<p>From a general intelligence,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of an interesting question.</p>
<p>Are we really motivated to do that?</p>
<p>And like, we just struggled ourselves right now</p>
<p>to even define what it is.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s hard to incentivize</p>
<p>when we don&rsquo;t even know what it is</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re incentivized to create.</p>
<p>And if you said mimic a human intelligence,</p>
<p>I just think there are so many challenges</p>
<p>with the significance and meaning of that.</p>
<p>That there&rsquo;s not a clear directive.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no clear directive to do precisely that thing.</p>
<p>So assistance in a larger and larger number of tasks.</p>
<p>So being able to,</p>
<p>a system that&rsquo;s particularly able to operate my microwave</p>
<p>and making a grilled cheese sandwich.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even know how to make one of those.</p>
<p>And then the same system will be doing the vacuum cleaning.</p>
<p>And then the same system would be teaching</p>
<p>my kids that I don&rsquo;t have math.</p>
<p>I think that when you get into a general intelligence</p>
<p>for learning physical tasks,</p>
<p>and again, I wanna go back to your body question</p>
<p>because I think your body question was interesting,</p>
<p>but you wanna go back to learning the abilities</p>
<p>to physical tasks.</p>
<p>You might have, we might get,</p>
<p>I imagine in that timeframe,</p>
<p>we will get better and better at learning these kinds</p>
<p>of tasks, whether it&rsquo;s mowing your lawn</p>
<p>or driving a car or whatever it is.</p>
<p>I think we will get better and better at that</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s learning how to make predictions</p>
<p>over large bodies of data.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re gonna continue to get better</p>
<p>and better at that.</p>
<p>And machines will outpace humans</p>
<p>in a variety of those things.</p>
<p>The underlying mechanisms for doing that may be the same,</p>
<p>meaning that maybe these are deep nets,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s infrastructure to train them,</p>
<p>reusable components to get them to do different classes</p>
<p>of tasks, and we get better and better</p>
<p>at building these kinds of machines.</p>
<p>You could argue that the general learning infrastructure</p>
<p>in there is a form of a general type of intelligence.</p>
<p>I think what starts getting harder is this notion of,</p>
<p>can we effectively communicate and understand</p>
<p>and build that shared understanding?</p>
<p>Because of the layers of interpretation that are required</p>
<p>to do that, and the need for the machine to be engaged</p>
<p>with humans at that level in a continuous basis.</p>
<p>So how do you get the machine in the game?</p>
<p>How do you get the machine in the intellectual game?</p>
<p>Yeah, and to solve AGI,</p>
<p>you probably have to solve that problem.</p>
<p>You have to get the machine,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s a little bit of a bootstrapping thing.</p>
<p>Can we get the machine engaged in the intellectual game,</p>
<p>but in the intellectual dialogue with the humans?</p>
<p>Are the humans sufficiently in intellectual dialogue</p>
<p>with each other to generate enough data in this context?</p>
<p>And how do you bootstrap that?</p>
<p>Because every one of those conversations,</p>
<p>every one of those conversations,</p>
<p>those intelligent interactions,</p>
<p>require so much prior knowledge</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s a challenge to bootstrap it.</p>
<p>So the question is, and how committed?</p>
<p>So I think that&rsquo;s possible, but when I go back to,</p>
<p>are we incentivized to do that?</p>
<p>I know we&rsquo;re incentivized to do the former.</p>
<p>Are we incentivized to do the latter significantly enough?</p>
<p>Do people understand what the latter really is well enough?</p>
<p>Part of the elemental cognition mission</p>
<p>is to try to articulate that better and better</p>
<p>through demonstrations</p>
<p>and through trying to craft these grand challenges</p>
<p>and get people to say, look,</p>
<p>this is a class of intelligence.</p>
<p>This is a class of AI.</p>
<p>Do we want this?</p>
<p>What is the potential of this?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the business potential?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the societal potential to that?</p>
<p>And to build up that incentive system around that.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think if people don&rsquo;t understand yet,</p>
<p>I think they will.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a huge business potential here.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s exciting that you&rsquo;re working on it.</p>
<p>We kind of skipped over,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m a huge fan of physical presence of things.</p>
<p>Do you think Watson had a body?</p>
<p>Do you think having a body adds to the interactive element</p>
<p>between the AI system and a human,</p>
<p>or just in general to intelligence?</p>
<p>So I think going back to that shared understanding bit,</p>
<p>humans are very connected to their bodies.</p>
<p>I mean, one of the challenges in getting an AI</p>
<p>to kind of be a compatible human intelligence</p>
<p>is that our physical bodies are generating a lot of features</p>
<p>that make up the input.</p>
<p>So in other words, our bodies are the tool</p>
<p>we use to affect output,</p>
<p>but they also generate a lot of input for our brains.</p>
<p>So we generate emotion, we generate all these feelings,</p>
<p>we generate all these signals that machines don&rsquo;t have.</p>
<p>So machines don&rsquo;t have this as the input data</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t have the feedback that says,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve gotten this emotion or I&rsquo;ve gotten this idea,</p>
<p>I now want to process it,</p>
<p>and then it then affects me as a physical being,</p>
<p>and I can play that out.</p>
<p>In other words, I could realize the implications of that,</p>
<p>implications again, on my mind body complex,</p>
<p>I then process that, and the implications again,</p>
<p>our internal features are generated, I learn from them,</p>
<p>they have an effect on my mind body complex.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s interesting when we think,</p>
<p>do we want a human intelligence?</p>
<p>Well, if we want a human compatible intelligence,</p>
<p>probably the best thing to do</p>
<p>is to embed it in a human body.</p>
<p>Just to clarify, and both concepts are beautiful,</p>
<p>is humanoid robots, so robots that look like humans is one,</p>
<p>or did you mean actually sort of what Elon Musk</p>
<p>was working with Neuralink,</p>
<p>really embedding intelligence systems</p>
<p>to ride along human bodies?</p>
<p>No, I mean riding along is different.</p>
<p>I meant like if you want to create an intelligence</p>
<p>that is human compatible,</p>
<p>meaning that it can learn and develop</p>
<p>a shared understanding of the world around it,</p>
<p>you have to give it a lot of the same substrate.</p>
<p>Part of that substrate is the idea</p>
<p>that it generates these kinds of internal features,</p>
<p>like sort of emotional stuff, it has similar senses,</p>
<p>it has to do a lot of the same things</p>
<p>with those same senses, right?</p>
<p>So I think if you want that,</p>
<p>again, I don&rsquo;t know that you want that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not my specific goal,</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a fascinating scientific goal,</p>
<p>I think it has all kinds of other implications.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s sort of not the goal.</p>
<p>I want to create, I think of it</p>
<p>as I create intellectual thought partners for humans,</p>
<p>so that kind of intelligence.</p>
<p>I know there are other companies</p>
<p>that are creating physical thought partners,</p>
<p>physical partners for humans,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s kind of not where I&rsquo;m at.</p>
<p>But the important point is that a big part</p>
<p>of what we process is that physical experience</p>
<p>of the world around us.</p>
<p>On the point of thought partners,</p>
<p>what role does an emotional connection,</p>
<p>or forgive me, love, have to play</p>
<p>in that thought partnership?</p>
<p>Is that something you&rsquo;re interested in,</p>
<p>put another way, sort of having a deep connection,</p>
<p>beyond intellectual?</p>
<p>With the AI?</p>
<p>Yeah, with the AI, between human and AI.</p>
<p>Is that something that gets in the way</p>
<p>of the rational discourse?</p>
<p>Is that something that&rsquo;s useful?</p>
<p>I worry about biases, obviously.</p>
<p>So in other words, if you develop an emotional relationship</p>
<p>with a machine, all of a sudden you start,</p>
<p>are more likely to believe what it&rsquo;s saying,</p>
<p>even if it doesn&rsquo;t make any sense.</p>
<p>So I worry about that.</p>
<p>But at the same time,</p>
<p>I think the opportunity to use machines</p>
<p>to provide human companionship is actually not crazy.</p>
<p>And intellectual and social companionship</p>
<p>is not a crazy idea.</p>
<p>Do you have concerns, as a few people do,</p>
<p>Elon Musk, Sam Harris,</p>
<p>about long term existential threats of AI,</p>
<p>and perhaps short term threats of AI?</p>
<p>We talked about bias,</p>
<p>we talked about different misuses,</p>
<p>but do you have concerns about thought partners,</p>
<p>systems that are able to help us make decisions</p>
<p>together as humans,</p>
<p>somehow having a significant negative impact</p>
<p>on society in the long term?</p>
<p>I think there are things to worry about.</p>
<p>I think giving machines too much leverage is a problem.</p>
<p>And what I mean by leverage is,</p>
<p>is too much control over things that can hurt us,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s socially, psychologically, intellectually,</p>
<p>or physically.</p>
<p>And if you give the machines too much control,</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a concern.</p>
<p>You forget about the AI,</p>
<p>just once you give them too much control,</p>
<p>human bad actors can hack them and produce havoc.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a problem.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;d imagine hackers taking over</p>
<p>the driverless car network</p>
<p>and creating all kinds of havoc.</p>
<p>But you could also imagine given the ease</p>
<p>at which humans could be persuaded one way or the other,</p>
<p>and now we have algorithms that can easily take control</p>
<p>over that and amplify noise</p>
<p>and move people one direction or another.</p>
<p>I mean, humans do that to other humans all the time.</p>
<p>And we have marketing campaigns,</p>
<p>we have political campaigns that take advantage</p>
<p>of our emotions or our fears.</p>
<p>And this is done all the time.</p>
<p>But with machines, machines are like giant megaphones.</p>
<p>We can amplify this in orders of magnitude</p>
<p>and fine tune its control so we can tailor the message.</p>
<p>We can now very rapidly and efficiently tailor the message</p>
<p>to the audience, taking advantage of their biases</p>
<p>and amplifying them and using them to persuade them</p>
<p>in one direction or another in ways that are not fair,</p>
<p>not logical, not objective, not meaningful.</p>
<p>And humans, machines empower that.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what I mean by leverage.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s not new, but wow, it&rsquo;s powerful</p>
<p>because machines can do it more effectively,</p>
<p>more quickly and we see that already going on</p>
<p>in social media and other places.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s scary.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why I go back to saying one of the most important</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I go back to saying one of the most important</p>
<p>public dialogues we could be having</p>
<p>is about the nature of intelligence</p>
<p>and the nature of inference and logic</p>
<p>and reason and rationality and us understanding</p>
<p>our own biases, us understanding our own cognitive biases</p>
<p>and how they work and then how machines work</p>
<p>and how do we use them to compliment basically</p>
<p>so that in the end we have a stronger overall system.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just incredibly important.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think most people understand that.</p>
<p>So like telling your kids or telling your students,</p>
<p>this goes back to the cognition.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how your brain works.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how easy it is to trick your brain, right?</p>
<p>There are fundamental cognitive,</p>
<p>you should appreciate the different types of thinking</p>
<p>and how they work and what you&rsquo;re prone to</p>
<p>and what do you prefer?</p>
<p>And under what conditions does this make sense</p>
<p>versus does that make sense?</p>
<p>And then say, here&rsquo;s what AI can do.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how it can make this worse</p>
<p>and here&rsquo;s how it can make this better.</p>
<p>And then that&rsquo;s where the AI has a role</p>
<p>is to reveal that trade off.</p>
<p>So if you imagine a system that is able to</p>
<p>beyond any definition of the Turing test to the benchmark,</p>
<p>really an AGI system as a thought partner</p>
<p>that you one day will create,</p>
<p>what question, what topic of discussion,</p>
<p>if you get to pick one, would you have with that system?</p>
<p>What would you ask and you get to find out</p>
<p>the truth together?</p>
<p>So you threw me a little bit with finding the truth</p>
<p>at the end, but because the truth is a whole nother topic.</p>
<p>But I think the beauty of it,</p>
<p>I think what excites me is the beauty of it is</p>
<p>if I really have that system, I don&rsquo;t have to pick.</p>
<p>So in other words, I can go to and say,</p>
<p>this is what I care about today.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what we mean by like this general capability,</p>
<p>go out, read this stuff in the next three milliseconds.</p>
<p>And I wanna talk to you about it.</p>
<p>I wanna draw analogies, I wanna understand</p>
<p>how this affects this decision or that decision.</p>
<p>What if this were true?</p>
<p>What if that were true?</p>
<p>What knowledge should I be aware of</p>
<p>that could impact my decision?</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m thinking is the main implication.</p>
<p>Can you prove that out?</p>
<p>Can you give me the evidence that supports that?</p>
<p>Can you give me evidence that supports this other thing?</p>
<p>Boy, would that be incredible?</p>
<p>Would that be just incredible?</p>
<p>Just a long discourse.</p>
<p>Just to be part of whether it&rsquo;s a medical diagnosis</p>
<p>or whether it&rsquo;s the various treatment options</p>
<p>or whether it&rsquo;s a legal case</p>
<p>or whether it&rsquo;s a social problem</p>
<p>that people are discussing,</p>
<p>like be part of the dialogue,</p>
<p>one that holds itself and us accountable</p>
<p>to reasons and objective dialogue.</p>
<p>I get goosebumps talking about it, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, this is what I want.</p>
<p>So when you create it, please come back on the podcast</p>
<p>and we can have a discussion together</p>
<p>and make it even longer.</p>
<p>This is a record for the longest conversation</p>
<p>in the world.</p>
<p>It was an honor, it was a pleasure, David.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for talking to me.</p>
<p>Thanks so much, a lot of fun.</p>
