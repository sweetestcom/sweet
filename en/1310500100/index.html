    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>The following is a conversation with Alexander Friedman.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a professor at Drexel University and the director of the Nijheim Plasma Institute.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s one of the top plasma physicists and plasma chemists in the world.</p>
<p>And most importantly to me, he&rsquo;s my dad.</p>
<p>Plasma, by the way, is not referring to blood plasma in biology,</p>
<p>but to the fourth state of matter in physics, solid, liquid, gas, and plasma,</p>
<p>which is a gas of charged particles that behaves in fascinating ways.</p>
<p>Plasma makes up the sun, the stars, lightning, plasma displays, fluorescent lamps,</p>
<p>and is the most common state of matter in the universe.</p>
<p>This is the 100th episode of this podcast.</p>
<p>There were quite a few very big conversations, which were all options,</p>
<p>but I decided to go back to where it all started for me</p>
<p>and to do a personal conversation with my dad.</p>
<p>This was a difficult conversation for me for many reasons,</p>
<p>but life is short.</p>
<p>Perhaps we needed microphones to give us a chance to say the things</p>
<p>we never would have said otherwise.</p>
<p>This is that conversation.</p>
<p>This is also a chance to briefly look back.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t know, I stepped down from my full-time position at MIT</p>
<p>to pursue a dream of building a startup around AI systems</p>
<p>that form meaningful connections with human beings.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t have much money.</p>
<p>The videos I&rsquo;ve made and this podcast was a way to try to pay for food and rent</p>
<p>while taking on the startup journey.</p>
<p>It also gave me a chance to have conversations with people who inspire me,</p>
<p>who make me think, and to share it with an amazing community.</p>
<p>Frankly, I don&rsquo;t know what to do with the idea</p>
<p>that this thing has been listened to 35 million times.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pretty sure most of those are AI bots,</p>
<p>but if you&rsquo;re one of the rare biological systems listening to this,</p>
<p>thank you.</p>
<p>I feel the love.</p>
<p>It gives me a lot of strength in both this and the startup.</p>
<p>By the way, since some people asked,</p>
<p>my full, very Russian birth name is Alexei, Alexei, or Alyosha,</p>
<p>or as my mom might say, Lyoshenka.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ve always enjoyed when my friends and people close to me</p>
<p>will call me Lex, or Lex in English.</p>
<p>A few folks and companies donated money and sponsored this podcast,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re the reasons I&rsquo;m here.</p>
<p>The best way you can support me in this journey</p>
<p>is to support the sponsors.</p>
<p>Please do.</p>
<p>I only do ads here in the intro and not in the middle.</p>
<p>For me as a fan, mid-roll ads get in the way of the conversation.</p>
<p>Maybe I&rsquo;m wrong about that.</p>
<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t be the first time.</p>
<p>Please click on the sponsor links in the description,</p>
<p>sign up, download, buy whatever they&rsquo;re selling.</p>
<p>That really is the best way to support the journey I&rsquo;m on.</p>

<p>More on each in a minute.</p>
<p>This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m an AI researcher and engineer first and foremost,</p>
<p>but I see AI as much bigger</p>
<p>than any one technical or scientific field.</p>
<p>I see it as our journey to understand and engineer the mind,</p>
<p>and to explore the nature of intelligence,</p>
<p>consciousness, human behavior,</p>
<p>the fabric of the universe that gifted us</p>
<p>the triumph and the tragedy of the human condition,</p>
<p>without telling us,</p>
<p>except for a few hints here and there,</p>
<p>about the meaning of it all.</p>
<p>I will talk to roboticists and philosophers,</p>
<p>physicists and historians,</p>
<p>mathematicians and astronauts,</p>
<p>and maybe even political leaders,</p>
<p>always returning to the technical which is home for me,</p>
<p>but also not being afraid to venture out</p>
<p>into the messy human world.</p>
<p>I honestly don&rsquo;t know how long I&rsquo;ll be doing this podcast.</p>
<p>Life is full of surprises,</p>
<p>but for at least a short while,</p>
<p>I hope you join me on this journey,</p>
<p>and thank you for coming along this far.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been binging on it.</p>
<p>Jordan is awesome.</p>
<p>He gets the best out of his guests,</p>
<p>dives deep, calls them out when it&rsquo;s needed,</p>
<p>and makes the whole thing fun to listen to.</p>
<p>His conversations with Kobe Bryant</p>
<p>and Neil deGrasse Tyson are good examples of that.</p>
<p>One part I remember re-listening to</p>
<p>is Neil talking with Jordan about fountain pens,</p>
<p>and how it brings you closer</p>
<p>to the words you&rsquo;re communicating.</p>
<p>Outside of interviews,</p>
<p>Jordan is also just inspiring and pragmatic,</p>
<p>giving you solid no BS life advice,</p>
<p>which is a nice compliment to what I ramble on</p>
<p>about in this podcast,</p>
<p>which can include things like AGI,</p>
<p>quantum field theory,</p>
<p>or whether neural networks</p>
<p>can ever truly understand language.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if any of that</p>
<p>gives you actionable life advice.</p>
<p>So search and listen to The Jordan Harbinger Show</p>
<p>on Apple Podcasts, Spotify.</p>
<p>Give him some love.</p>
<p>Tell him I sent you.</p>
<p>This episode is supported by Magic Spoon.</p>
<p>Low carb, keto friendly, delicious cereal.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been on a mix, as you might know,</p>
<p>of keto and carnivore diet for a very long time now.</p>
<p>That means eating very little carbs.</p>
<p>I used to love cereal.</p>
<p>Obviously, most cereals have crazy amounts of sugar,</p>
<p>which is terrible for you.</p>
<p>So I quit years ago.</p>
<p>But Magic Spoon is a totally new thing.</p>
<p>Zero sugar, 11 grams of protein,</p>
<p>and only three net grams of carbs.</p>
<p>It tastes delicious,</p>
<p>and honestly way too good to be true.</p>
<p>I use it to celebrate a good training session,</p>
<p>like the push-ups and pull-ups challenge</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been ramping up for.</p>
<p>It has four flavors,</p>
<p>cocoa, fruity, frosted, and blueberry.</p>
<p>I tried all of them.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all delicious.</p>
<p>But if you know what&rsquo;s good for you,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll go with cocoa,</p>
<p>my favorite flavor,</p>
<p>and the flavor of champions.</p>

<p>You won&rsquo;t regret it.</p>
<p>And now here&rsquo;s my conversation with my dad,</p>
<p>Alexander Friedman.</p>
<p>What to you is the most beautiful idea</p>
<p>in physics, chemistry, or mathematics?</p>
<p>Oh, let&rsquo;s go to that place first</p>
<p>before we go to Kiev.</p>
<p>The most beautiful in physics, chemistry,</p>
<p>I would say, I would say Einstein.</p>
<p>His ideas regarding stochastic motion</p>
<p>and Brownian motion,</p>
<p>I think it is the most beautiful,</p>
<p>clear, simple idea.</p>
<p>Because from this, like stochastics,</p>
<p>you can prove existence of molecules,</p>
<p>believe me or not.</p>
<p>It was, I think it was his first publication</p>
<p>in 1905 with his first wife.</p>
<p>Actually, it was significantly her idea.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>They were collaborators.</p>
<p>Those five, four, four, five papers he published.</p>
<p>Yeah, actually, almost everything</p>
<p>which Einstein did,</p>
<p>it was published the most important stuff.</p>
<p>They were published in one year, 1905.</p>
<p>But the first idea was probably the most elegant.</p>
<p>Can you describe Brownian motion</p>
<p>and why you think it&rsquo;s beautiful?</p>
<p>You see that people at that time,</p>
<p>they understand that if molecules,</p>
<p>if they exist,</p>
<p>their motion is absolutely chaotic.</p>
<p>What he proved that doesn&rsquo;t matter</p>
<p>what size of particles is,</p>
<p>their motion is similar and about the same.</p>
<p>So it is not necessary to see molecules.</p>
<p>You can look at bigger particles.</p>
<p>Like if you smoke, there is particles</p>
<p>and you can see like a propagation of this smoke.</p>
<p>And from here, determine behavior of molecules.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s actually relatively short,</p>
<p>very elegant, very clear.</p>
<p>And at that point, people,</p>
<p>they kept talking about molecules,</p>
<p>but it was no proof</p>
<p>because there is no like a super electronic microscope</p>
<p>to see them.</p>
<p>So, you know, I&rsquo;m saying, yes, molecules exist.</p>
<p>You said, well, I mean, can you show me that?</p>
<p>So Einstein made it and boom.</p>
<p>And he proved, and a lot of people</p>
<p>after this publication said,</p>
<p>probably molecules really exist.</p>
<p>Einstein, 1905.</p>
<p>So what do you like about that idea?</p>
<p>Simplicity.</p>
<p>Simplicity of proving something</p>
<p>very, very, very, very, very, very complicated.</p>
<p>So if I ask you, for example,</p>
<p>you know, molecules exist.</p>
<p>Can you prove it?</p>
<p>Obviously, like now you would say,</p>
<p>okay, I have a special electronic microscope</p>
<p>and I can take a look.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a molecule, okay.</p>
<p>But when you go back to beginning of 20th century,</p>
<p>people, they were laughing.</p>
<p>Can you prove something?</p>
<p>No, you cannot.</p>
<p>I said, no, no, no.</p>
<p>Take a look.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s something very simple.</p>
<p>Very, very simple.</p>
<p>What do you think it takes to do that kind of thinking</p>
<p>and come to those ideas?</p>
<p>And how many times have you encountered</p>
<p>those kinds of ideas in your life?</p>
<p>Have you had any?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I would say</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a whole beauty, my feeling.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a whole beauty of science.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, you know,</p>
<p>people, they say, no, no, no, no.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s impossible.</p>
<p>And you say, no, no, wait.</p>
<p>Take a look.</p>
<p>Wait a second.</p>
<p>Read it.</p>
<p>Take a look.</p>
<p>Just think for five minutes.</p>
<p>If something is very complicated,</p>
<p>you know, Kapitsa, Nobel Prize laureate,</p>
<p>like I work with him, by the way,</p>
<p>he used to say, if it is complicated,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s probably wrong.</p>
<p>Well, it was a lot of discussion between Kapitsa and Landau</p>
<p>because Landau, he enjoyed to do something</p>
<p>in a most complicated way.</p>
<p>While his friend Kapitsa,</p>
<p>he was trying to do everything in an absolutely simple way.</p>
<p>And they had all these discussions</p>
<p>because sometimes Kapitsa, he went to extremes</p>
<p>and he used to say,</p>
<p>well, this is simple.</p>
<p>It means this is right.</p>
<p>And Landau, he was like, okay,</p>
<p>you mean that everything with simple is right?</p>
<p>I mean.</p>
<p>Like Feynman too.</p>
<p>He liked the simple.</p>
<p>Yes, yes, yes, yes.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the whole point to find this simplicity.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the beauty of science.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the beauty.</p>
<p>Really, that&rsquo;s the beauty of science.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s something worth to do.</p>
<p>Like&hellip;</p>
<p>At the risk of going religious for a second,</p>
<p>why do you think our universe allows for such simplicity</p>
<p>to be discovered?</p>
<p>That such simplicity exists at all?</p>
<p>I can tell you.</p>
<p>It is very similar to Darwin&rsquo;s theory.</p>
<p>Why, I don&rsquo;t know, why animals are this way, not other way.</p>
<p>So it is actually competition.</p>
<p>Take a look about simplicity.</p>
<p>In beauty of physics,</p>
<p>like you have two interacting planets</p>
<p>and the force is proportional to one over r squared.</p>
<p>In this case, they are able to go in circles or in ellipses.</p>
<p>If there is another law,</p>
<p>they are either falling or going out.</p>
<p>So like a&hellip;</p>
<p>So if like our solar system exists,</p>
<p>so just the interaction would be one over r squared.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s very interesting about Isaac Newton</p>
<p>and his way of thinking.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s also was a super, I would say, genius.</p>
<p>Is it weird to you, talking about Newton,</p>
<p>that action at a distance, for example?</p>
<p>This stuff I was doing in elementary school,</p>
<p>which is funny.</p>
<p>Without any knowledge of physics,</p>
<p>but I was doing physics because of fighting.</p>
<p>Throwing things.</p>
<p>Oh, better than that, better than that.</p>
<p>We played, well, it was third, second, third grade.</p>
<p>Second, third grade.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s in 1962, 1963.</p>
<p>So from one hand, you know, Kyiv that time.</p>
<p>So people, they were excited about wars,</p>
<p>obviously, always, especially boys.</p>
<p>And also, you know, we were way better than Americans</p>
<p>because, you know, we have first Sputnik.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And Gagarin.</p>
<p>I remember how happy we were.</p>
<p>When was Gagarin?</p>
<p>What year?</p>
<p>Do you remember?</p>
<p>Oh, I&rsquo;m afraid to make a mistake,</p>
<p>but I think it&rsquo;s 1961 or 1962.</p>
<p>1961, 1962.</p>
<p>Because what I remember,</p>
<p>that I wasn&rsquo;t either in the first grade or second grade.</p>
<p>And it was no bread, believe me or not.</p>
<p>At that time, it was a big problem because of Khrushchev.</p>
<p>And the kids&hellip;</p>
<p>Shortage of bread?</p>
<p>Shortage of all kinds of food?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Potatoes?</p>
<p>No, it was a mistake, actually, of Khrushchev</p>
<p>because when he came to America,</p>
<p>he saw that corn is everywhere.</p>
<p>And he decided that if he put enough corn in Russia,</p>
<p>Russia will be way stronger</p>
<p>from the point of every cultures in America.</p>
<p>But he overdid it.</p>
<p>As a result, it was a shortage of wheat.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why I remember this moment.</p>
<p>So just for kids.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how you remember?</p>
<p>So yeah, so for kids, what hurts is the lack of bread.</p>
<p>No, no, no, no, no.</p>
<p>Each day during the class,</p>
<p>the special guy used to come and give</p>
<p>a small piece of white bread to each kid.</p>
<p>White bread, yeah.</p>
<p>White bread.</p>
<p>And at the same time,</p>
<p>like a teacher announced,</p>
<p>oh, I forgot about this.</p>
<p>Gagarin went to the space.</p>
<p>And kids, they even forgot about this.</p>
<p>The bread.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s how big of a moment it is</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s more important than bread.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, but take a look.</p>
<p>If you are a boy, you think about this,</p>
<p>you think about space.</p>
<p>So like one half of boys,</p>
<p>they want to be astronauts,</p>
<p>cosmonauts, we used to say.</p>
<p>And the other half wanted to design rockets.</p>
<p>So I was from this second part.</p>
<p>Second part.</p>
<p>So myself with friends,</p>
<p>we start designing small rockets</p>
<p>to fight.</p>
<p>Second grade.</p>
<p>Second grade.</p>
<p>Second, third, second, third grade.</p>
<p>And we have been fighting</p>
<p>with these guys from a next door house.</p>
<p>Because these idiots,</p>
<p>they used to use only stones against us.</p>
<p>Well, and it was a big fence between houses.</p>
<p>So just they throw stones.</p>
<p>And we decided to make rockets.</p>
<p>Well, and we made it.</p>
<p>And a scientist was born.</p>
<p>Engineer too.</p>
<p>Yes, it was both science and engineering.</p>
<p>Well, let me ask, was it that moment</p>
<p>or in general,</p>
<p>when did you first fall in love with science?</p>
<p>I would say science,</p>
<p>I think clearly this fight</p>
<p>with these bad boys.</p>
<p>Yes, the rocks.</p>
<p>With the kids.</p>
<p>Which keep throwing stones</p>
<p>from another side of the fence.</p>
<p>And we start making rockets.</p>
<p>What does it mean a rocket?</p>
<p>As a fuel, we use a mixture</p>
<p>of photographic films</p>
<p>with special chemicals.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>We consult with the boys from high school</p>
<p>about some details.</p>
<p>And we made it more or less.</p>
<p>And then it was,</p>
<p>that stuff was actually wrapped</p>
<p>into the silver foil.</p>
<p>And in the end, we put like a match.</p>
<p>So with another match, we light it.</p>
<p>And this stuff was going like</p>
<p>sometimes 10 meters.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And it was able to go to like two meters high.</p>
<p>But very often it was mistakes</p>
<p>because we were bad with stability.</p>
<p>So what I try to calculate at this moment</p>
<p>is like a trajectory.</p>
<p>Stability meaning while it&rsquo;s in the air,</p>
<p>the control problem.</p>
<p>Yes, yes, control.</p>
<p>So I try to-</p>
<p>You try to calculate what?</p>
<p>A motion.</p>
<p>To describe the motion.</p>
<p>Where to point it.</p>
<p>Where to point it to be sure</p>
<p>that it will go far enough</p>
<p>and it will go above the fence,</p>
<p>which was maybe one meter 80</p>
<p>or something like that.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>So what was most interesting to you?</p>
<p>The calculations of the math of physics</p>
<p>or calculating the trajectory</p>
<p>or the fact that you could engineer,</p>
<p>build something that&rsquo;s based on science?</p>
<p>In the beginning.</p>
<p>In the beginning, to be honest,</p>
<p>I was happy to fight these idiots</p>
<p>on the other side of the fence.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Which, what&rsquo;s funny that we used to do that</p>
<p>and they kept throwing stones,</p>
<p>which actually you cannot prove anything.</p>
<p>But then in the end of this period,</p>
<p>actually I fall in love with science.</p>
<p>What is science to you?</p>
<p>Sort of in that period?</p>
<p>To an eight-year-old or whatever?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s predicting events.</p>
<p>So not just to throw a stone,</p>
<p>but just to make something</p>
<p>and just take a look, we made it.</p>
<p>So the creation.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And also another important stuff.</p>
<p>When you are doing this kind of stuff,</p>
<p>so your friends,</p>
<p>they start thinking that you are not so bad, you know?</p>
<p>Oh, it&rsquo;s a way to earn respect.</p>
<p>Credit on the playground.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>We were not interested in girls.</p>
<p>When we are like a second, third grade,</p>
<p>we just, we hated girls.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But it was very important to have respect from.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>From fellow boys.</p>
<p>From fellow comrades.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a camaraderie and just feeling</p>
<p>and secret from parents.</p>
<p>Just to linger on it,</p>
<p>because you brought up Gagarin.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts?</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s inspired, on the American side,</p>
<p>the Apollo missions inspired an entire generation of scientists.</p>
<p>What was your thought about Gagarin and the space race</p>
<p>and how did it made you feel?</p>
<p>What role did it play in your life?</p>
<p>To be honest, the whole country had a huge respect to Gagarin.</p>
<p>He was a nice person, very simple.</p>
<p>And he was a hero, because, you know,</p>
<p>to be first to go to the space,</p>
<p>knowing that percentage of success at the time with dogs</p>
<p>was way far from 100%, it&rsquo;s a big deal.</p>
<p>I would not say that it inspired like a science.</p>
<p>No, it did not.</p>
<p>But making rockets, it was just interesting.</p>
<p>And about America, we are way better than America.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the way we have been thinking.</p>
<p>I mean, come on.</p>
<p>Is that, yeah, that&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>It was even not a question.</p>
<p>Yeah, and America was saying the same.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s propaganda.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s propaganda, but keep in mind,</p>
<p>very, very important actually,</p>
<p>at that time, in these years,</p>
<p>Russia was way ahead, because it was no NASA.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>So the fact that Russia was way ahead</p>
<p>is what motivated America to really step it up.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s from one hand, but from another hand,</p>
<p>for Russian kids of second grade and third grade,</p>
<p>come on, we didn&rsquo;t think about America.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like, you know.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s millions of miles away.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Besides physics, you also have poetry in your blood.</p>
<p>So what has been your relationship to poetry, music?</p>
<p>What role did it play in your life?</p>
<p>Poetry, a lot.</p>
<p>But it is way later than elementary school.</p>
<p>Actually, like music-wise,</p>
<p>you know, like all teenagers,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re in love with music,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just exactly the same now</p>
<p>and 20 years ago and 30 years ago.</p>
<p>I would say at that time,</p>
<p>at that time,</p>
<p>we were all in love with one special group,</p>
<p>which is Beatles.</p>
<p>And what was extremely later,</p>
<p>I was in sixth grade, fifth grade,</p>
<p>64, 65, 66.</p>
<p>And in Soviet Union, Beatles, they were forbidden,</p>
<p>believe me or not.</p>
<p>It was absolutely strange,</p>
<p>but at the same time, if something is forbidden,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s exactly what you love most.</p>
<p>So I remember that for my big successes in science,</p>
<p>I was awarded with going to this best of the best</p>
<p>camps, pioneer camps, Artek in Crimea.</p>
<p>And over there, it was international,</p>
<p>so I met with, I lived together with a group</p>
<p>of people from France,</p>
<p>because I was the only one</p>
<p>kind of speaking fluently in French.</p>
<p>And we just made trade,</p>
<p>so we gave whatever we used to have,</p>
<p>and we got&hellip;</p>
<p>Beatles records?</p>
<p>Beatles records.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so great.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the rebellion you&rsquo;re a part of,</p>
<p>but what about poetry?</p>
<p>When did you first,</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;ve written a lot of poetry.</p>
<p>I wrote a lot, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Maybe, do you remember an early poem you&rsquo;ve written?</p>
<p>A bad one?</p>
<p>A good one?</p>
<p>You know, I started doing that late,</p>
<p>so it was, I was in seventh grade, I think.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s late?</p>
<p>Writing poetry?</p>
<p>I thought, okay.</p>
<p>And writing poetry is a little bit related to</p>
<p>when boys, they start looking at girls</p>
<p>with a little bit different eyes.</p>
<p>I mean, we just&hellip;</p>
<p>So love is somehow behind poetry for you?</p>
<p>Even not so much, even love,</p>
<p>even just, you know, this imagination.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Like way far from reality,</p>
<p>and it is romanticism.</p>
<p>Were you a serious poet or a funny poet?</p>
<p>Because you have a lot of humor and wits in your poetry.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s later.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But at that time, I was extremely serious</p>
<p>and extremely romantic,</p>
<p>which never, ever after that.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s hard to imagine.</p>
<p>Yeah, but it is kind of a little bit</p>
<p>like a childish romanticism.</p>
<p>Well, childish, I mean, you know.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s interesting enough</p>
<p>that first poetry was actually almost immediately,</p>
<p>from my point of view, very good.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like, you know,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing something not good,</p>
<p>and then better, and then better, and then better.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually all the way opposite.</p>
<p>Best stuff which I wrote, it was like a&hellip;</p>
<p>Seventh grade.</p>
<p>Well, more like eighth and ninth grade.</p>
<p>And I wrote a lot at that time.</p>
<p>Why do you think you were&hellip;</p>
<p>So what does it mean?</p>
<p>What does good poetry mean?</p>
<p>That means it&rsquo;s not cheesy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s beautifully worded and crafted.</p>
<p>It is, yes.</p>
<p>And so where did that come from?</p>
<p>Because most people, even great poets,</p>
<p>are terrible at first.</p>
<p>So why were you so clever quickly?</p>
<p>Because most people know you as really clever.</p>
<p>No, I mean, with words, right?</p>
<p>Very good with words.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re saying that was early on,</p>
<p>you already had that.</p>
<p>Yes, I have no good answer.</p>
<p>Just it comes from nowhere.</p>
<p>Yeah, from&hellip;</p>
<p>But my first&hellip;</p>
<p>From rockets to&hellip;</p>
<p>Oh, no, no.</p>
<p>To witty poetry, is there a connection?</p>
<p>It was, actually, to be honest, no, not so much connection.</p>
<p>But in Russian culture, romanticism,</p>
<p>it is extremely important element,</p>
<p>starting from 19th century, romanticism.</p>
<p>So just it was very popular.</p>
<p>So either you are writing good poetry or bad poetry,</p>
<p>or you are an artist, you are painting something.</p>
<p>So I have a lot of friends, they were painting.</p>
<p>Do you remember a poetry?</p>
<p>Do you remember a poem from that time</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve written, by any chance?</p>
<p>Yeah, sure.</p>
<p>I remember most of them by heart.</p>
<p>You mind reciting?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re in Russian.</p>
<p>Russian is good, as long as they&rsquo;re not in French.</p>
<p>I have in French also.</p>
<p>You want me just to&hellip;</p>
<p>Please.</p>
<p>What do you think, what&rsquo;s comfortable?</p>
<p>You know, maybe I will read one poem,</p>
<p>which I like most from that period.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not sure that I wrote something better after that.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s a little bit cheesy.</p>
<p>However, but not much.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s even not about girls, it&rsquo;s about music.</p>
<p>But still with a romanticized kind of theme.</p>
<p>With a very strong romanticism.</p>
<p>It was the result of me reading a book,</p>
<p>–ü–µ—Ä–µ–∫–ª—é—á–µ–Ω–∏—è –ö–∞—Ç–∞–º—É—Ä–∞,</p>

<p>Actually, it&rsquo;s a story of a cat who found a book,</p>
<p>or like a notebook of people,</p>
<p>and he started reading about that and analyzing their life.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a life of people through eyes of a very, very smart cat.</p>
<p>So then I can read it in Russian, right?</p>
<p>I mean, this is poetry, if you want.</p>
<p>Please, please, that would be great.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>

<p>So, seventh grade, so this is&hellip;</p>
<p>Eighth grade, probably.</p>
<p>Fifteen.</p>
<p>That is, that&rsquo;s very good.</p>
<p>Yeah, and it&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s romanticism, you know.</p>
<p>With a little bit of, like, too much.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s musically cheesiness, a little bit, I would say.</p>
<p>But very strong.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s go, let&rsquo;s go to Kyiv.</p>
<p>Okay, let&rsquo;s go to Kyiv.</p>
<p>You were born and raised in Kyiv,</p>
<p>just like you said,</p>
<p>with the guys with the rocks and the rockets.</p>
<p>But that was the stupid guys.</p>
<p>You know, I guess we already got that.</p>
<p>You can hold a grudge.</p>
<p>What are some memories of your dad and mom that stand out?</p>
<p>Okay, yeah.</p>
<p>What we do?</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s drink.</p>
<p>Japanese.</p>
<p>Yeah, what are we drinking?</p>
<p>Japanese whiskey.</p>
<p>They call it From the Barrel.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not sponsored by Nikko Whiskey.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s good whiskey.</p>
<p>Yeah, we do not.</p>
<p>But they are doing a very, very good job.</p>
<p>And they are in Sapporo.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s Hokkaido, north of Japan.</p>
<p>So they are doing good beer, which is Sapporo.</p>
<p>They good, very good whiskey.</p>
<p>And a lot of red caviar.</p>
<p>And actually, that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>Did you ever think,</p>
<p>when you were that shortage of bread</p>
<p>and you were doing the rocket,</p>
<p>that you would be sitting here in America</p>
<p>a few years later drinking Japanese whiskey,</p>
<p>talking about caviar?</p>
<p>Did you even know what caviar was?</p>
<p>No, no, obviously.</p>
<p>Because caviar, it was for holidays a little bit.</p>
<p>And it was distributed.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like you go and buy it.</p>
<p>But you got it a little bit, like a small can.</p>
<p>So all of us, we knew that.</p>
<p>And just, it was very popular.</p>
<p>Well, let me just actually ask that question.</p>
<p>How did you imagine where you would be 50 years from then?</p>
<p>How did you think about your future?</p>
<p>Actually, like in about eight grades, nine grades,</p>
<p>I was very, very, very, very, very, very good</p>
<p>in physics, mathematics, and chemistry.</p>
<p>So I was actually in this system</p>
<p>of like an Olympiad, so-called, competition.</p>
<p>I was absolutely number one in Ukraine twice.</p>
<p>And absolute number two in Soviet Union, also twice.</p>
<p>This is physics competition or mathematics competition?</p>
<p>Okay, it was physics.</p>
<p>So for people who don&rsquo;t know, maybe you can explain.</p>
<p>I mean, this still goes on to this day.</p>
<p>These are very intense competitions.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if they&rsquo;re that popular in the United States.</p>
<p>Probably because United States folks don&rsquo;t do as great.</p>
<p>It is extremely popular, but not in physics.</p>
<p>What is going on in this country,</p>
<p>I was very much impressed.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very serious and very tough competition in mathematics.</p>
<p>In math, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>In physics less, in biology less.</p>
<p>So you already knew someone in eighth grade</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re very good at, you said, wait a minute,</p>
<p>you said chemistry too.</p>
<p>Yes, chemistry too.</p>
<p>Physics, chemistry, and you competed.</p>
<p>You won in Ukraine.</p>
<p>And I was number two in Soviet Union, it was twice.</p>
<p>Now, very interesting that in Soviet Union,</p>
<p>it was a rule, you&rsquo;re supposed to choose.</p>
<p>So you can participate in this competition</p>
<p>in physics, mathematics, and chemistry.</p>
<p>And all three of them, up to the level of championship</p>
<p>of the region, of the big city.</p>
<p>In my case, it was Kiev.</p>
<p>But then to go to competition in Ukraine,</p>
<p>you have to choose.</p>
<p>You can go only to one.</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>So I won physics and chemistry and mathematics in Kiev.</p>
<p>Then I choose physics.</p>
<p>And I was going to Ukraine.</p>
<p>And now if you win in Ukraine,</p>
<p>so a couple of people from the whole Ukraine</p>
<p>goes to this championship of Soviet Union.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an incredible accomplishment, by the way.</p>
<p>It was incredible.</p>
<p>I mean, you peaked in terms of physics and poetry at age 14.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a big difference.</p>
<p>In physics, I was really on top of the Soviet Union,</p>
<p>which is a huge country.</p>
<p>In poetry, it was just, I&rsquo;m not a professional.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t compete in poetry, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, well, basically over there,</p>
<p>gold medal from high school.</p>
<p>What do you call here, valedictorian?</p>
<p>Which is hard to do.</p>
<p>I would say here, it&rsquo;s also very not so easy,</p>
<p>depending on the school.</p>
<p>But in Kiev, it was an interesting situation</p>
<p>because you have to,</p>
<p>the most difficult was actually not physics, mathematics,</p>
<p>and it was writing.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Because it was writing not on the computer</p>
<p>without spell check.</p>
<p>And you have to write 20, let me see, let me see.</p>
<p>No, 12.</p>
<p>12 pages as a minimum of an essay,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s supposed to be zero mistakes.</p>
<p>And Russian language is not the easiest one.</p>
<p>And when you say mistakes, I mean, this is what is important.</p>
<p>Mistakes are grammar, grammar mistake.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just, it&rsquo;s grammar, it&rsquo;s writing mistakes too?</p>
<p>No, what do you mean writing mistakes?</p>
<p>Just incorrect use of word or something like that.</p>
<p>Can you cross stuff out?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>This is the, you can&rsquo;t make a mistake</p>
<p>in the actual writing process.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re writing with a pen, cursive.</p>
<p>You were not supposed to make any corrections.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re not allowed to cross the lines,</p>
<p>and so it&rsquo;s perfection in all the silliest forms.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s silly.</p>
<p>But maybe, what do you think about that?</p>
<p>What do you think about that strictness?</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s easy to criticize from a distance,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s something powerful about it.</p>
<p>Yes, there is.</p>
<p>You know what country is more powerful</p>
<p>from this point of view is?</p>
<p>Japan.</p>
<p>Is Japan strictness.</p>
<p>I was so much impressed with their kids,</p>
<p>what they keep saying that in Japan for kids,</p>
<p>it does matter if it&rsquo;s a holiday,</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s a weekend, or whatever,</p>
<p>each day you&rsquo;re supposed to train</p>
<p>with these Japanese characters,</p>
<p>because if not, it&rsquo;s just impossible</p>
<p>just to remember it.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re working too hard,</p>
<p>but as a result, they consider for them quality,</p>
<p>because quality means no mistakes.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a very interesting point.</p>
<p>What does it mean quality?</p>
<p>It means perfectionism.</p>
<p>And this perfectionism creates this kind of whiskey.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>This is what perfect tastes like.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>I mean, it forces you to take education seriously,</p>
<p>everything seriously,</p>
<p>like this craftsmanship, craftsmanship seriously.</p>
<p>Yes, yes, yes.</p>
<p>And you know, I mentioned to you this exam,</p>
<p>this exam in Russian essay,</p>
<p>but it was something which was worse than that.</p>
<p>Because it was Kiev,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re supposed to take two essays,</p>
<p>one in Russian language,</p>
<p>and also in Ukrainian language.</p>
<p>So think for a second,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not your native language,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re supposed to also write this</p>
<p>at least 12 pages</p>
<p>with zero mistakes</p>
<p>and without any possibility to make any,</p>
<p>it should be perfect.</p>
<p>As a result, it was funny that I speak Ukrainian,</p>
<p>not bad at all.</p>
<p>Because of this,</p>
<p>I would not say that&rsquo;s a good idea,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s kind of Russian version of a Japanese story.</p>
<p>Yeah, and there&rsquo;s a lot of interesting other strict things,</p>
<p>like you have to memorize poetry,</p>
<p>you have to memorize things,</p>
<p>which, I mean, that&rsquo;s a really interesting exercise.</p>
<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s what probably you remember.</p>
<p>Yep, it still was there when I was there, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, like I used to know at least thousand poems by heart.</p>
<p>By heart.</p>
<p>And you still remember many of your own by heart.</p>
<p>Yeah, it basically helps with mathematics.</p>
<p>How?</p>
<p>Good memory, just&hellip;</p>
<p>Memory.</p>
<p>Okay, so you said you already knew,</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s an incredible accomplishment</p>
<p>to be at that level in physics at that young age.</p>
<p>So what did you think about the future,</p>
<p>returning to the original question?</p>
<p>Where do you think that would take you,</p>
<p>this fascination and this skill with physics?</p>
<p>Did you imagine being a professor?</p>
<p>Did you imagine being Einstein?</p>
<p>You know, kids in high school,</p>
<p>I mean, at least between us,</p>
<p>and I was like already in high school,</p>
<p>it was like special high school in physics and mathematics.</p>
<p>We were all like not only dreaming,</p>
<p>but being sure we can do that,</p>
<p>we can be best of the best in the world.</p>
<p>And it was a very popular subject.</p>
<p>At that time, if you are like the best in physics,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s way more, you are way more popular</p>
<p>than a guy who is the best in basketball.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>Why do you think that is in the Soviet Union,</p>
<p>that it was so respected and so admired</p>
<p>when you were great at science?</p>
<p>It was propaganda.</p>
<p>So it was the state created that?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So, and it was good, actually.</p>
<p>Do you think we&rsquo;ll ever see that in America</p>
<p>without authoritarian and a democracy?</p>
<p>Because in America, Brad Pitt and Michael Jordan</p>
<p>are the superstars and scientists.</p>
<p>Most people don&rsquo;t know a single scientist</p>
<p>except Einstein in America.</p>
<p>Well, I would say, my feeling,</p>
<p>it should happen in America.</p>
<p>It should happen to boys and girls in America.</p>
<p>It should be.</p>
<p>It should, meaning like that&rsquo;s a good thing</p>
<p>or should you think that way?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very important because if kids in America,</p>
<p>they are just not so much good in sciences,</p>
<p>sooner or later, we will lose competition</p>
<p>to countries where science is</p>
<p>very much high prestige.</p>
<p>Example, today, unfortunately, it&rsquo;s not Russia.</p>
<p>The best example today is probably China.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been there.</p>
<p>I saw their high schools.</p>
<p>We have to be very careful with that.</p>
<p>So, my feeling that it should be done</p>
<p>because in America, university education</p>
<p>is way stronger than in Russia</p>
<p>and is way stronger than in Europe,</p>
<p>but high school education in America</p>
<p>is not so strong.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s difficult to understand why,</p>
<p>but why do you think the universities</p>
<p>are so strong in America?</p>
<p>Why do you think the most Nobel Prizes</p>
<p>are from America?</p>
<p>Why do you think science is so good</p>
<p>even though scientists were never</p>
<p>really worshiped in America?</p>
<p>Because in Russia, it was always a problem.</p>
<p>So, the strongest people, students, kids,</p>
<p>they are very hard workers</p>
<p>when they are in high school</p>
<p>because after that,</p>
<p>there is a very strong competition</p>
<p>to get to a good university.</p>
<p>Very, very, very challenging.</p>
<p>The same in China.</p>
<p>So, you have to be very good</p>
<p>to enter a very good university.</p>
<p>So, kids, they work like crazy to do that.</p>
<p>Also, boys, they knew that they have&hellip;</p>
<p>Take a look.</p>
<p>You have one chance in most of cases</p>
<p>with the exception of a couple of universities.</p>
<p>You have only one chance to go to one university</p>
<p>to try yourself.</p>
<p>If you make it, you become a student.</p>
<p>If not, you go to the army for three years.</p>
<p>So, it&rsquo;s very interesting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very psychologically interesting situation</p>
<p>because what is going on?</p>
<p>You have to make a decision by yourself.</p>
<p>Are you strong enough to go to the best place?</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s only one place you can go.</p>
<p>Now, they start changing the system.</p>
<p>But in the 1960s, 70s, 80s, 90s, it was the case.</p>
<p>So, just you have&hellip;</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a big cost of failing.</p>
<p>Once you choose and you don&rsquo;t get in.</p>
<p>Cost, not money-wise, but real cost, you go to army.</p>
<p>If you are a boy,</p>
<p>if you just overestimate yourself&hellip;</p>
<p>Is that when you got that line in your hair?</p>
<p>That period?</p>
<p>So, for people who don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>my dad&rsquo;s hair now is white,</p>
<p>but he used to have this sexy stripe</p>
<p>down the middle for many decades.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>10, 20, 30, a lot of years.</p>
<p>In my pictures, I have this stripe now.</p>
<p>Anymore, not anymore.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good look now.</p>
<p>So, anyway, is that when you got the stress?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when you were&hellip;</p>
<p>Oh no, the stress was&hellip;</p>
<p>It was a real stress.</p>
<p>What happened?</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s a bad story.</p>
<p>I told you that when I was finishing high school,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a 10th grade at that time,</p>
<p>I became a champion of Ukraine, number one,</p>
<p>and second in Soviet Union,</p>
<p>which was a very, very big deal.</p>
<p>After that, five kids from Soviet Union</p>
<p>were supposed to go to international competition.</p>
<p>And this international competition was the same dates</p>
<p>as exams to enter the university.</p>
<p>So, if you are like in five best kids in physics,</p>
<p>five best kids in mathematics,</p>
<p>five best kids in whatever, chemistry,</p>
<p>they were able to skip these final exams,</p>
<p>which means to skip this essay in language,</p>
<p>one language essay, another language,</p>
<p>and you skip all exams.</p>
<p>But instead of that,</p>
<p>you prepare to international competition.</p>
<p>So, because I was number two,</p>
<p>I was clearly in the team,</p>
<p>so I was not supposed to go to these stupid exams.</p>
<p>And, well, but it was this telephone call</p>
<p>of our leader from Moscow.</p>
<p>He said that it&rsquo;s like one week before,</p>
<p>but unfortunately you have to be replaced</p>
<p>with another guy</p>
<p>because they are unable to give you a visa.</p>
<p>Oh, wow.</p>
<p>And that was actually, yeah, that was like&hellip;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what caused the stress?</p>
<p>It was a very big stress.</p>
<p>And at that point,</p>
<p>like people, including those from America</p>
<p>and Zionist motion,</p>
<p>they came to me and they asked me,</p>
<p>you know, to make speech</p>
<p>and just to say something and to do something.</p>
<p>And they talk to my dad, to your grandfather.</p>
<p>And he spoke with people from KGB</p>
<p>because he was like also a big guy at that time.</p>
<p>And he came to me and said,</p>
<p>okay, you do whatever you want</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s your life.</p>
<p>You make a decision.</p>
<p>But they told me that if you</p>
<p>forgot about what happened,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll have gold medal,</p>
<p>which is over there.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll pass all exams</p>
<p>and you will have A,</p>
<p>well, five in Russian,</p>
<p>A, the highest grade,</p>
<p>whatever you do,</p>
<p>it will be A.</p>
<p>And then you go to any university you want</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll be accepted.</p>
<p>This is KGB talking, those kinds of folks.</p>
<p>Yeah. And I hesitated.</p>
<p>And I said, well, yeah, I agree.</p>
<p>I will not fight against the system.</p>
<p>So can you explain a little bit,</p>
<p>does you being Jewish have anything to do with it?</p>
<p>Absolutely. It&rsquo;s 100%.</p>
<p>Because it was, actually, it was 1970.</p>
<p>And in this moment, it was a very significant,</p>
<p>actually, push to immigration for Jewish people,</p>
<p>to Israel and to America.</p>
<p>And they were afraid, always,</p>
<p>that they just give all these awards to the guy</p>
<p>and he will say, okay, guys, goodbye.</p>
<p>I just decided to go to whatever, to America</p>
<p>or to Germany or whatever, or to Israel.</p>
<p>Keeping that in mind,</p>
<p>just in case, they prefer not to give visa.</p>
<p>And at that time, interestingly enough, it&rsquo;s KGB,</p>
<p>so they do not give visa</p>
<p>and they do not give any explanation why.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Just, you cannot do that.</p>
<p>However, however, they say he&rsquo;s a good guy</p>
<p>and if he accepts, that will do everything for him.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t worry.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also a risk because you never know they can,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t know, maybe,</p>
<p>maybe I am so smart,</p>
<p>but actually, without special preparation,</p>
<p>I went to the super exams and I got A.</p>
<p>You did well.</p>
<p>I did well.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the reason of this strife,</p>
<p>which appeared in a very short boom.</p>
<p>It was a source of stress,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m not exactly understanding the depth of the stress.</p>
<p>It was very significant.</p>
<p>Did you have a choice to make?</p>
<p>I mean, it doesn&rsquo;t feel like there&rsquo;s a choice.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually when already I made a decision,</p>
<p>I was already with a strike.</p>
<p>Okay, so the decision process was a strike for you.</p>
<p>Because I was, it&rsquo;s like, you know,</p>
<p>I was falling from a limp or whatever,</p>
<p>because I was feeling that everything is like,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m best of the best in the world, whatever,</p>
<p>and booms, they actually put me in my place, you know.</p>
<p>It was a difficult moment,</p>
<p>but then I was accepted,</p>
<p>and it was, you know, immediately celebration,</p>
<p>because, you know, I got this gold medal,</p>
<p>which is a big deal in Soviet Union.</p>
<p>So gold medal represents being valedictorian.</p>
<p>Valedictorian, right.</p>
<p>So did you experience anti-Semitism</p>
<p>leading up to that moment in your life?</p>
<p>Did you feel that you were,</p>
<p>were you made to feel that you were Jewish?</p>
<p>Did you experience life as a Ukrainian Jew,</p>
<p>or simply as a Ukrainian?</p>
<p>Oh, well.</p>
<p>For the listener, my dad is uncomfortable,</p>
<p>likes to avoid uncomfortable conversations,</p>
<p>so I have to force him into uncomfortable conversations.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s not only me,</p>
<p>just like all our generation.</p>
<p>At that time in Ukraine,</p>
<p>in Ukraine, Ukraine at that time,</p>
<p>it was not the same as Ukraine today.</p>
<p>So level of anti-Semitism was way higher</p>
<p>in Ukraine than in other places.</p>
<p>Other Soviet republics?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Why is that?</p>
<p>Is there any historical reason for that, do you think?</p>
<p>Well, it was actually historical,</p>
<p>significantly historical reasons,</p>
<p>starting from Bogdan Khmelnytskyi.</p>
<p>So at some point,</p>
<p>a couple of hundred years before that,</p>
<p>Jews, they supported Polish people,</p>
<p>and it was against Russia, against Ukraine.</p>
<p>So just level of anti-Semitism was very high</p>
<p>in these kind of countries.</p>
<p>Also, this area was inside of Pale of Settlement.</p>
<p>So it means there was a lot of Jews,</p>
<p>a lot of Jews, a lot of problem with Jews.</p>
<p>In Moscow, it was forbidden for Jews to leave,</p>
<p>so no Jews, no problems.</p>
<p>So when I actually moved from Kiev to Moscow,</p>
<p>it is like a day and night.</p>
<p>So Moscow, it was beautiful.</p>
<p>I mean, I did not feel, well,</p>
<p>I feel, I felt, but not so much, I would say.</p>
<p>In Ukraine, always I felt that I&rsquo;m Jewish,</p>
<p>but from another hand,</p>
<p>you remember all these kids from our yard,</p>
<p>like stones, et cetera, et cetera,</p>
<p>both groups, they were Jewish.</p>
<p>So what I&rsquo;m trying to say,</p>
<p>that Jews, they lived actually together.</p>
<p>So from that point of view,</p>
<p>you know, it&rsquo;s less, it&rsquo;s a huge anti-Semitism,</p>
<p>but they are somewhere.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re somewhat isolated from it because?</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s like a Jewish ghetto.</p>
<p>Jews stick together.</p>
<p>I mean, the Jews, it&rsquo;s historical ghetto.</p>
<p>Yeah, okay, let&rsquo;s jump back.</p>
<p>We were saying that you were born and raised in Kiev.</p>
<p>What are your favorite</p>
<p>or maybe most representative memories</p>
<p>of your dad and mom from the earlier years?</p>
<p>Well, it was a beautiful family.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re only child.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just, just the one.</p>
<p>Yes, and</p>
<p>my father, he was a hero of World War II,</p>
<p>and he was actually always with a stick</p>
<p>because, you know, he was.</p>
<p>Like a cane, yeah.</p>
<p>A cane, right.</p>
<p>He was heavily wounded during the war and.</p>
<p>He operated the gun, the machine gun.</p>
<p>Yes, yes, very complicated situations.</p>
<p>So he was risking his life enormously,</p>
<p>and the only reason he survived</p>
<p>because he was heavily wounded.</p>
<p>So just, it was the end of the war for him.</p>
<p>And, you know, and as a boy, you know,</p>
<p>for me, he was, and he was a real hero.</p>
<p>He was.</p>
<p>Like, you know, it&rsquo;s not, it&rsquo;s very different from me.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like a big hands, you know, like always.</p>
<p>He was not drinking Japanese whiskey.</p>
<p>He was drinking only one thing.</p>
<p>Vodka.</p>
<p>Yeah, you remember, like we had somewhere.</p>
<p>Yeah, we&rsquo;ll get to the vodka.</p>
<p>Yeah, but what I&rsquo;m trying to say</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s a different personality.</p>
<p>And he just, from this Jewish boy,</p>
<p>he became an associate minister of construction of Ukraine,</p>
<p>which was a very big deal.</p>
<p>So he was like this, he&rsquo;s very much different from me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like a little bit like a softer personality,</p>
<p>like my mother, but he was a very tough guy.</p>
<p>Yeah, were you afraid of him?</p>
<p>Um, what does it mean to be afraid?</p>
<p>He loved me, but he was a person,</p>
<p>like, you know, very strong personality.</p>
<p>So yes, when, if I did something wrong,</p>
<p>oh, you remember the story?</p>
<p>No, no, I mean, with these idiots from another.</p>
<p>From the, yeah.</p>
<p>In these rockets.</p>
<p>So yes, I was afraid of my father.</p>
<p>So I had huge respect.</p>
<p>And my mother, she was like a nice Jewish mother.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>Well, let me kind of ask a hard question.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve lost your dad a few years ago.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What did it feel like when you learned that he died?</p>
<p>What went through your head?</p>
<p>What memories?</p>
<p>Well, like, you know, losing your parents, it&rsquo;s losing your parents.</p>
<p>So I would say, what I can say, it&rsquo;s a losing parent.</p>
<p>And my father, it was a whole generation.</p>
<p>You know, it is just like a, and, you know,</p>
<p>the feeling you have that now you are the man.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s interesting, but the feeling is</p>
<p>now it&rsquo;s my turn to be great.</p>
<p>Now just I have to do something.</p>
<p>Now just, because when you have your parents,</p>
<p>you always have this feeling that there is something behind you, just in case.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And my father, he was very, very, very strong personality.</p>
<p>Just this interesting story that during this</p>
<p>during this</p>
<p>Jewish persecution in 1952 by Stalin,</p>
<p>when it was a so-called affair of doctors or whatever,</p>
<p>how to say in English,</p>
<p>–¥–µ–ª–æ –≤—Ä–∞—á–µ–π,</p>
<p>when Jewish people were actually said just they&rsquo;re doctors and,</p>
<p>okay, most of doctors were Jewish, basically.</p>
<p>And so they used to say that they actually kill</p>
<p>half of the government or whatever as a doctors.</p>
<p>It was absolutely lie.</p>
<p>It just says nothing with reality.</p>
<p>And Jews, they were prepared actually to be moved</p>
<p>from all over the Soviet Union to Birobidzhan,</p>
<p>to like a close to Chinese border on Amur River.</p>
<p>Like, oh, it&rsquo;s already,</p>
<p>they tried to move them closer to Japanese whiskey.</p>
<p>Um, so like in camps or what?</p>
<p>Just, just, just, just kind of move them.</p>
<p>To the so-called Jewish oblast, Jewish region or whatever.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s like, it was nothing there.</p>
<p>And if you move like this kind of group of people,</p>
<p>it was about 3 million Jews, not to forget,</p>
<p>you know, at least half will die just during this moving.</p>
<p>So it was nothing.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re preventing them from having a future.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So at that time, you know, people, they kept start,</p>
<p>kept talking about the same stupid stuff.</p>
<p>The Jews, they drink blood of babies, of Christian babies.</p>
<p>And, and that&rsquo;s what my father used to say that his friends,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like, you know, it&rsquo;s like a meeting.</p>
<p>And, you know, people, they&rsquo;re asking,</p>
<p>have you seen something?</p>
<p>Have you seen him like a drinking blood</p>
<p>or something like that?</p>
<p>And he said that he was absolutely impressed with his friends.</p>
<p>And all of them, they, most of them, I mean,</p>
<p>they are, or either leaving the room,</p>
<p>just not to participate in this stupidity.</p>
<p>Or they say we haven&rsquo;t seen, but who knows</p>
<p>if people, they write in newspapers.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very strong propaganda.</p>
<p>So that he lost, he was an associate director</p>
<p>of this manufacturing plant.</p>
<p>And, and they say that he&rsquo;s supposed to leave.</p>
<p>Because, because this whole propaganda,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a Jew and Jews are drinking the blood</p>
<p>of Christian babies.</p>
<p>Maybe.</p>
<p>Maybe, who knows.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s, maybe it&rsquo;s enough.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s no evidence that they&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So, so he&rsquo;s not going to a prison,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s not going to work in our enterprise.</p>
<p>So he said, okay, I am like associate director</p>
<p>and I want to be a worker, a simplest worker.</p>
<p>But because I love my plants.</p>
<p>I said, no.</p>
<p>So actually he left.</p>
<p>Yeah, but why, why does that memory stand out for you?</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because it was, it was 1952 and I was born in 1953.</p>
<p>So, so what was happening that he was without job</p>
<p>for one year because nobody wanted to,</p>
<p>to take him before Stalin died in 1953.</p>
<p>And it was a moment when I was born.</p>
<p>So my mother, she worked to support the whole family</p>
<p>and we lived in a small room, 14 square meters.</p>
<p>It was my grandmother, grandfather, father, mother, and me.</p>
<p>So the, I mean the.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of, it was a big impact on,</p>
<p>and then Stalin died and everything become way better.</p>
<p>It is.</p>
<p>And in terms of antisemitism as well.</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>You see, there is a good movie, by the way,</p>
<p>made here in America, Russian Jews part one,</p>
<p>Russian Jews part two, Russian Jews part three.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s on YouTube actually.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So what is that?</p>
<p>It was almost no antisemitism before World War II.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>It was very strong antisemitism</p>
<p>after the end of the World War II</p>
<p>and in 1945 and death of Stalin in 1953.</p>
<p>In 1953 situation become better, but not as good,</p>
<p>way not as good as in 1930s.</p>
<p>Why was there antisemitism after the war,</p>
<p>the second World War?</p>
<p>It seems.</p>
<p>It is.</p>
<p>How did Russia, sorry to interrupt.</p>
<p>How did Russians in your memory think about</p>
<p>the cruelty of the Holocaust?</p>
<p>Because there&rsquo;s so much pride about Russia winning the war,</p>
<p>of being the, you know, to getting to Berlin.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t, how do you think about the people that were tortured?</p>
<p>Well, very, very strong, very strong propaganda.</p>
<p>Propaganda.</p>
<p>Very strong propaganda.</p>
<p>So what happened that, okay,</p>
<p>what actually happened that in the end of, okay,</p>
<p>before World War II, before World War II,</p>
<p>actually Jewish people, they just,</p>
<p>they forgot that they&rsquo;re Jews.</p>
<p>It was, I mean, they were all Soviet, so like-</p>
<p>Soviet first.</p>
<p>Soviet first, way, way first.</p>
<p>I mean, it was before war.</p>
<p>In the end of the war, Jewish people,</p>
<p>they create a lot of special organizations</p>
<p>and because of Holocaust,</p>
<p>they had significant support of United States of America</p>
<p>and the Western countries,</p>
<p>but mostly United States of America.</p>
<p>And Jewish people in the end of World War II,</p>
<p>they start thinking that,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like my story with this,</p>
<p>when I graduated from high school.</p>
<p>So they started believing that they are the guys, you know,</p>
<p>because they have so much support from United States.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s also, and on top of that,</p>
<p>like a cherry, it was a creation of Israel.</p>
<p>Right, that was around then, so-</p>
<p>In 1949.</p>
<p>There was a kind of a push that Jews are no longer Soviets.</p>
<p>Their homeland is Israel.</p>
<p>Yes, and Jews, they felt like initially very nice,</p>
<p>but they overdid it.</p>
<p>So bottom line, it was a,</p>
<p>and also don&rsquo;t, not to forget about Hitler.</p>
<p>So as a result, level of antisemitism in,</p>
<p>from 1945 to 1953 was growing significantly.</p>
<p>Then it was a little bit better,</p>
<p>but actually significant improvements start happening</p>
<p>only in 1960s, not earlier than that.</p>
<p>So can you talk a little bit more</p>
<p>about your dad&rsquo;s journey in World War II?</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s, I remember a bunch of stories,</p>
<p>but, you know, just for people interested,</p>
<p>you know, World War II is at the core of our family,</p>
<p>in a sense.</p>
<p>So can you just linger,</p>
<p>and maybe if you have memories about his impact,</p>
<p>how did he get injured?</p>
<p>What was his relationships with, you know,</p>
<p>violence, with death, with bullets flying everywhere?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>My father, he was born in 1923.</p>
<p>So in, and-</p>
<p>Where?</p>
<p>In Minsk.</p>
<p>Which is now Belarus.</p>
<p>And he was born in October.</p>
<p>So when World War started, he was 17.</p>
<p>And it was forbidden to go to army</p>
<p>if you are younger than 18.</p>
<p>So together with friends,</p>
<p>they make change in the passport.</p>
<p>They just change their year from,</p>
<p>they made themselves one year older</p>
<p>just to be accepted to the army.</p>
<p>And interesting enough that, like,</p>
<p>the way I understand, at least,</p>
<p>these people who organized, like, army,</p>
<p>they understand, they saw that these boys,</p>
<p>they are younger, but they let them go.</p>
<p>He wanted to go.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>He wanted to go.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s so many stories in Vietnam War in America</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s a lot of people, brave people,</p>
<p>who found ways to not go.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Here-</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s absolutely opposite.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s absolutely opposite because most,</p>
<p>well, not everybody with this one,</p>
<p>but majority, propaganda was extremely strong.</p>
<p>So protecting your fatherland, motherland, it&rsquo;s-</p>
<p>Even to die for your country is-</p>
<p>Yes, yes, yes.</p>
<p>So to die for your country, it was kind of like an honor.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And also they were sure that Red Army</p>
<p>is 100 times stronger than these Germans.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So, and they thought that, okay, we&rsquo;ll go there,</p>
<p>so a couple of months and we are winners.</p>
<p>But in one way or another, but they were all wanted to go.</p>
<p>Especially when, you know, you are not like a very rich guy, you know.</p>
<p>So he went to the army and it was like a couple of months special preparation to become</p>
<p>like a lowest level of officers.</p>
<p>So junior lieutenant or whatever it is in this country.</p>
<p>In this country.</p>
<p>And he became like this low level officer.</p>
<p>And he starts actually near Moscow and just start going back and back and back and back.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>And he was with this machine gun, big one.</p>
<p>And, you know, the change of like,</p>
<p>this was very fast.</p>
<p>So people, they were killed very, very, very fast.</p>
<p>Actually.</p>
<p>People that were operating machine guns.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Very, very fast.</p>
<p>Because just like the changeover.</p>
<p>So he became division commander reasonably fast.</p>
<p>Not division, but regiment.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one way to move up when everybody&rsquo;s dying.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>And what he kept saying, I think even to you,</p>
<p>because he just, it was like he kept saying that for some reason he was absolutely sure</p>
<p>that every, he saw that like everybody else are killed and he&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>So he was kind of sure that something is protecting him.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s invincible.</p>
<p>And yes, he&rsquo;s invincible.</p>
<p>He might have been right.</p>
<p>And he was very strong, actually.</p>
<p>Very, very, very strong.</p>
<p>Like, by the way.</p>
<p>Physically and mentally?</p>
<p>Physically and mentally.</p>
<p>So kind of like, I mean, he&rsquo;s like, because it&rsquo;s a little bit not like myself,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s very physically strong and mentally protected.</p>
<p>Like, I don&rsquo;t know what best way to say that.</p>
<p>He was sure in himself and he was sure that.</p>
<p>Is it confidence?</p>
<p>Is that ego?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not ego.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s confidence.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a confidence.</p>
<p>A little bit like a, kind of like a religious.</p>
<p>He did not believe to the God in the first place,</p>
<p>but he believed in what he used to say in his star.</p>
<p>So there is a star which protects him.</p>
<p>And he might be right.</p>
<p>He survived the war.</p>
<p>He survived the war because after like four, no, like five or six months,</p>
<p>he was heavily wounded, which was very good.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Actually, because that&rsquo;s why he survived.</p>
<p>In the leg?</p>
<p>In the leg, yeah.</p>
<p>So he was like, and he had a lot of this award, et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p>Do you remember what about the people in general?</p>
<p>You know, 20 million plus Soviet people died.</p>
<p>What impact?</p>
<p>Do you remember what impact the war had on the people?</p>
<p>Enormous.</p>
<p>Enormous.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why for 20 million, it is a lot.</p>
<p>And at that time&hellip;</p>
<p>Maybe half of them were just civilians.</p>
<p>Because Stalin, he just operated this war without counting people.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But do you think it had powerful creative impact in terms of music, art, literature, science?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>The sad thing about war, right?</p>
<p>All of the above.</p>
<p>Science mostly.</p>
<p>All of the above.</p>
<p>Because even before war, science was very much pushed up.</p>
<p>But after the war, scientists, they were considered like the key people in the world,</p>
<p>especially military scientists.</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever asked you this.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t asked you most of the things I&rsquo;m asking.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re Jewish.</p>
<p>Hitler killed a lot of Jews.</p>
<p>How did you feel about the Holocaust?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ve actually really talked about&hellip;</p>
<p>Is it just an intellectual tragedy to you?</p>
<p>Or did it ever feel&hellip;</p>
<p>What do you think about human nature after that?</p>
<p>Oh, you see that I have parents, and my parents, they have parents, which my grandparents,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re my great-grandparents.</p>
<p>So all of those, all of those, without exception, were killed in Holocaust.</p>
<p>Zero died with their own death, natural death.</p>
<p>All of them, they were killed.</p>
<p>Because they were already a little bit older, like I am now.</p>
<p>And they were sure that Germans, they will not touch them.</p>
<p>Come on, just do something to old people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of strange.</p>
<p>And all of them, without exception, all of them, they were killed.</p>
<p>So it is, you know, like initially in my life, it was like a clear hatred</p>
<p>with respect to Germans in general.</p>
<p>Which only later, I mean, it was clear that it&rsquo;s not Nazi, it&rsquo;s not Germany-Germany,</p>
<p>but it was very serious feelings about that.</p>
<p>So hatred.</p>
<p>But so as you grew up, did it, are you hopeful about whether people are good or evil?</p>
<p>And did that have an impact on, you know, the fact that you can see so much evil?</p>
<p>You can become cynical.</p>
<p>Were you still, did you, is there still an optimistic, positive person inside you?</p>
<p>Yeah, there is.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m optimistic.</p>
<p>Myself, I am optimistic.</p>
<p>So just like the point is that like I was, when I just started growing up, even in high school,</p>
<p>the level of anti-Semitism was like way lower.</p>
<p>And in general, I felt myself always way more Soviet</p>
<p>than I was a Russian, Ukrainian, or Jewish.</p>
<p>What was your relationship with the Soviet Union?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll talk about coming to America, but what was your feeling?</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re proud?</p>
<p>For many years, I was very proud.</p>
<p>I was very proud of this style of life where science is really popular,</p>
<p>where people, they&rsquo;re working not for money, but people are working for,</p>
<p>for to make something interesting, to make something good.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a place where if you, if you, if you&rsquo;re good, you are awarded.</p>
<p>And that was a healing.</p>
<p>It was propaganda, obviously.</p>
<p>So for like, when I was in elementary school, middle school, high school,</p>
<p>I would say in school, I was feeling that I&rsquo;m extremely proud of Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Then it was this shock change.</p>
<p>And then a lot of friends, they started going to Israel or America.</p>
<p>So just everything started changing.</p>
<p>Everything started changing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s after Stalin, after&hellip;</p>
<p>Oh, it&rsquo;s, no, no, it&rsquo;s way later.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s already, I&rsquo;m talking about like 1970s.</p>
<p>In the 70s, yeah.</p>
<p>In 1970s, already like people, they again start feeling that they&rsquo;re Jewish</p>
<p>because of significant immigration to America and to Israel.</p>
<p>Okay, so you were in Kiev through high school.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s look to your next chapter of your life.</p>
<p>And can you tell me what is FISTECH?</p>
<p>As it&rsquo;s, I don&rsquo;t even know what the full in English name is.</p>
<p>Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology.</p>
<p>And what is it in Russian, the full name?</p>
<p>–ú–æ—Å–∫–æ–≤—Å–∫–∏–π —Ñ–∏–∑–∏–∫–æ-—Ç–µ—Ö–Ω–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–π –∏–Ω—Å—Ç–∏—Ç—É—Ç.</p>
<p>–ú–§–¢–ò, –¥–∞?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like MIT, but with a P.</p>
<p>Yeah, it is, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>M-I-P-T?</p>
<p>Yes, yeah, yeah, it is M-I-P-T, yes, M-I-P-T.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s kind of&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a kind of MIT.</p>
<p>Kind of, it&rsquo;s maybe a little more like a Caltech.</p>
<p>Oh, no, was there an engineering component?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s very small, right?</p>
<p>I mean, it was&hellip;</p>
<p>It was the size of Caltech.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And it was very much focused on science and military science.</p>
<p>And now, sorry to interrupt, now this was in Moscow.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And so you came&hellip;</p>
<p>From Kiev to Moscow.</p>
<p>To Moscow.</p>
<p>So how did you get into FISTECH?</p>
<p>So, yeah, so you said FISTECH is focused on science, military science.</p>
<p>This is like the&hellip;</p>
<p>I saw on the internet this description of, and maybe you can talk to it,</p>
<p>math and physics education at MIT.</p>
<p>The number of hours, I think, or compared to FISTECH.</p>
<p>And they were, I mean, they were making&hellip;</p>
<p>First of all, the FISTECH education is shorter</p>
<p>and covers like an order of magnitude more material.</p>
<p>Yes, exactly.</p>
<p>And what, can you explain what that experience is like?</p>
<p>What their idea of the kind of how they&rsquo;re putting you through is,</p>
<p>what the philosophy is?</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve been looking for.</p>
<p>Because, you know, don&rsquo;t forget that, well, you&rsquo;re coming to the place</p>
<p>and you feel yourself best in the world.</p>
<p>And when you meet people from, you know, outside,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re like a different personality.</p>
<p>You are from MIPT.</p>
<p>You are from FISTECH.</p>
<p>So it was a lot of songs, a lot of&hellip;</p>
<p>It was a very&hellip;</p>
<p>And we were so much proud, that number of credit hours.</p>
<p>It was incredibly&hellip;</p>
<p>We worked from nine to five each day.</p>
<p>You can, from nine to five, it is eight hours.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s eight hours of classes.</p>
<p>How many days a week?</p>
<p>Six days a week.</p>
<p>So you can count, and it&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>And the level was, and, you know, requirements,</p>
<p>they are very, very, very, very strong.</p>
<p>And this is math, physics, chemistry.</p>
<p>What was the range of subjects?</p>
<p>Important ways, importance.</p>
<p>When you enter, you start with very high-level mathematics,</p>
<p>physics, and chemistry, actually.</p>
<p>So why did you want to go to FISTECH?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s basically because you felt</p>
<p>that you were one of the best people in the world</p>
<p>at math and physics, so this is the place to go?</p>
<p>And chemistry, yes.</p>
<p>And chemistry.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the way to go.</p>
<p>Basically, when I came to Moscow, I hesitated for about one day,</p>
<p>because I also, I was in love with mathematics,</p>
<p>and mathematics meant, like, freedom.</p>
<p>So they had less classes,</p>
<p>they were more open for, like, creative thinking,</p>
<p>while FISTECH, it was like,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the best word to say,</p>
<p>what they do, like, in sports,</p>
<p>like, when you make, like, something extremely hard for you,</p>
<p>like, what&rsquo;s the name, how you say,</p>
<p>for military, for military, for military.</p>
<p>Well, you want to say bootcamp.</p>
<p>Yeah, I want to say bootcamp, but&hellip;</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, this is really intense process</p>
<p>of weeding out the week.</p>
<p>Yes, and that was going on, actually,</p>
<p>so the significant number of students,</p>
<p>they were actually leaving after the first semester.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It was extremely challenging.</p>
<p>Also, keep in mind that it was about, okay,</p>
<p>usually group, it was, like, 25 people, 30,</p>
<p>and usually one girl.</p>
<p>So it is, like, whatever, 3% girls, 97 boys.</p>
<p>It also creates a very special atmosphere.</p>
<p>Well, maybe just before we get into the special atmosphere,</p>
<p>what was your journey to FISTECH like?</p>
<p>So I think I read a book,</p>
<p>A Love and Math by Ed Frankel, also Russian.</p>
<p>I think he mentions FISTECH in there,</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s also Jewish,</p>
<p>and he said that there was a lot of anti-Semitism,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a bunch of schools that you weren&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a bunch of schools that you weren&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>I mean, it was either explicitly or implicitly</p>
<p>no Jews allowed.</p>
<p>Yeah, well.</p>
<p>So did you, so what was the process</p>
<p>of getting into this place,</p>
<p>and how much anti-Semitism was there in that picture?</p>
<p>At that period, it was 1970,</p>
<p>it was a clear, well, it&rsquo;s anti-Semitism,</p>
<p>yes, absolutely, but what I mean,</p>
<p>that it was, like, for Jews,</p>
<p>it was very difficult to get into the universities,</p>
<p>very simple,</p>
<p>but in most of universities,</p>
<p>the rule was kind of hidden,</p>
<p>so just, it was like a Jewish boy and a non-Jewish boy,</p>
<p>and they were going to the same exam,</p>
<p>and the professor gives, like, a D or C for a Jewish guy,</p>
<p>and, like, B or A for a non-Jewish guy,</p>
<p>if their level is the same.</p>
<p>It was just in most of places,</p>
<p>but Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology,</p>
<p>it was very different.</p>
<p>Exams, they were absolutely honest.</p>
<p>However, they count grades.</p>
<p>It was two exams in physics,</p>
<p>and two exams in mathematics.</p>
<p>Oral mathematics, written mathematics,</p>
<p>oral physics, written physics.</p>
<p>A, B, C, D, and A is five,</p>
<p>B is four, C is three, D is two,</p>
<p>and if you&rsquo;re Jewish,</p>
<p>an exam, they were very, very, very, very, very, very tough.</p>
<p>Yeah, the oral, I hear.</p>
<p>All of them, and both, written and oral,</p>
<p>they were extremely challenging,</p>
<p>but equally for, doesn&rsquo;t matter,</p>
<p>you are Jewish, you are not Jewish, whatever.</p>
<p>Now, if you are Jewish,</p>
<p>you have to have, to go through that,</p>
<p>you have to have either 19 or 20,</p>
<p>which means, yeah,</p>
<p>which means it should be A, A, A, A, or one B.</p>
<p>While if you are not Jewish,</p>
<p>17 is absolutely okay,</p>
<p>16, some people, 15, some people.</p>
<p>So it was made clear,</p>
<p>and beside that, it&rsquo;s completely fair.</p>
<p>Yeah, but it was, you know,</p>
<p>it was, from some point of view, it was good,</p>
<p>because it is not like cheating.</p>
<p>It was like a clear rule, let&rsquo;s do it.</p>
<p>Also, it was very interesting that after exams,</p>
<p>it was a special interview,</p>
<p>and it was interview with really high-level scientists.</p>
<p>It was like two or three famous, famous, famous scientists,</p>
<p>and one or two KGB people.</p>
<p>And they just, you know, manage this operation,</p>
<p>and it is impossible to discuss, you know.</p>
<p>They say, yes, you are accepted, great.</p>
<p>Or they say, no, you&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s our decision.</p>
<p>So what was your favorite subject, topic, ideas</p>
<p>that you fell in love with in the first few years of Vistech?</p>
<p>It was general physics,</p>
<p>because we had absolutely beautiful lecturer,</p>
<p>and I have his books, even now I have over there.</p>
<p>He wrote like a lot of books.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s his name, do you remember?</p>
<p>Sivukhin.</p>
<p>Sivukhin.</p>
<p>Yeah, and he was very interesting personality.</p>
<p>I was in love with him for, I would say, two years,</p>
<p>not more than that,</p>
<p>because his idea was you have to present physics</p>
<p>absolutely without calculus.</p>
<p>So it should be no derivatives and no integration.</p>
<p>How is that possible?</p>
<p>Just you do physics, you can&hellip;</p>
<p>When we say physics, you mean like mechanics, so it&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>No, no, no, no, no, no.</p>
<p>Physics means physics.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s mechanics, it&rsquo;s the thermal sciences,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s electricity, optics, and nuclear physics.</p>
<p>Everything.</p>
<p>Without calculus.</p>
<p>The only thing he didn&rsquo;t attach, it was no quantum mechanics.</p>
<p>Was quantum mechanics in the air back then?</p>
<p>Yeah, obviously.</p>
<p>But not for this gentleman, not for this professor.</p>
<p>He was not so much, he was not famous scientist.</p>
<p>He was a famous teacher.</p>
<p>And then, only then, I just, you know,</p>
<p>jumped to the world of theoretical physics and chemistry.</p>
<p>So the next step in my life</p>
<p>is just jumping into theoretical physics.</p>
<p>And what branch of theoretical physics were you interested in?</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve never actually heard you talk much about</p>
<p>the world of the big, like general relativity,</p>
<p>so looking out into the stars.</p>
<p>You were more interested in,</p>
<p>like what physics phenomena were you interested in?</p>
<p>Now or that time?</p>
<p>So at that time.</p>
<p>At that time, after these two years with Sivukhin,</p>
<p>I just changed completely to absolutely opposite approach</p>
<p>to purely theoretical physics.</p>
<p>And at that time, the most popular,</p>
<p>it was the so-called Landau Minimum.</p>
<p>So Landau, 10 books.</p>
<p>And they are, believe me, they are wow.</p>
<p>So they are so hard.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>They are just, for some reason, they&rsquo;re just, you know,</p>
<p>hardest of the hardest, like very challenging, very difficult.</p>
<p>And the boys, so just they say,</p>
<p>if you want to show yourself,</p>
<p>you have to go the so-called Landau Minimum,</p>
<p>which you have to go through 10 exams.</p>
<p>Actually, 11, because the first one was mathematics.</p>
<p>And then whatever, physics one, physics two, physics 10.</p>
<p>And, you know, it was a challenge.</p>
<p>It was very difficult.</p>
<p>So I went through that just actually, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>just to prove that I can do that.</p>
<p>To be honest, I did not, in the end, at least I hate that</p>
<p>because it was not so much, it is not Feynman.</p>
<p>You know, it is just something opposite to that.</p>
<p>The opposite, yeah.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s painful almost for the sake of being painful.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like you are doing the martial arts.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just to show yourself that you can do that.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what I did.</p>
<p>And then when I was actually, I was keep doing that.</p>
<p>But in the middle, it was the first time</p>
<p>when I came to Kurchatov Institute of Atomic Energy.</p>
<p>So speaking of which,</p>
<p>what is the Kurchatov Institute of Atomic Energy?</p>
<p>And who was your, sort of, I feel like in FISTECH,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an advisor.</p>
<p>So who was your advisor?</p>
<p>Who were the mentors in this period of your life?</p>
<p>Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very interesting approach.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a so-called FISTECH system.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What does it mean?</p>
<p>It means that first three years, you work in classes.</p>
<p>And then you go to actual national labs.</p>
<p>And you choose them, they choose you, et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p>And three years, you work there and you listen to the classes.</p>
<p>But these classes, they are not from teachers,</p>
<p>not from teaching professors,</p>
<p>but from very, very high-level actual scientists.</p>
<p>So&hellip;</p>
<p>And who was the person that you connected with?</p>
<p>Who was your advisors in that fourth year, fifth year?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well&hellip;</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s Kurchatov?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the connection.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Kurchatov, it&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s downtown Moscow, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Kurchatov, it&rsquo;s a guy, it&rsquo;s like a father of Russian atomic bomb.</p>
<p>And he built a big reactor in center of Moscow.</p>
<p>And interesting enough that it was in 19&hellip;</p>
<p>In 19, 19, 1946, I think, yeah.</p>
<p>They built the first reactor and then the bomb in 1949.</p>
<p>So, and it was&hellip;</p>
<p>You know, like in America, there is a group of national labs,</p>
<p>different, like Oak Ridge National Lab, Los Alamos National Lab,</p>
<p>Argonne National Lab, et cetera.</p>
<p>In Russia, I would say most of these labs,</p>
<p>they were combined together in this one Kurchatov Institute of Atomic Energy.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like, you can imagine like a combination of</p>
<p>most of American national labs in one place.</p>
<p>It was 15,000 people working there.</p>
<p>15,000, it&rsquo;s a huge&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a city inside of city.</p>
<p>And when they were created, they were focused on</p>
<p>nuclear physics and nuclear engineering</p>
<p>and everything around development to build atomic bomb.</p>
<p>And the same thing for fusion bombs, so for hydrogen bombs.</p>
<p>And, but later they add solid phase physics groups, et cetera.</p>
<p>So just, it was, I would say, and it&rsquo;s still now,</p>
<p>the most, I would say, the strongest research center in the old Soviet Union.</p>
<p>So I decided to go there and I decided to go to plasma.</p>
<p>So in January, 1972, I came to&hellip;</p>
<p>They did not let me inside of Kurchatov Institute.</p>
<p>I came only to the gate.</p>
<p>And I met my first professor who brought me there.</p>
<p>It was Professor Leonid Rudakov.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s now Professor Emeritus of University of Maryland.</p>
<p>I saw him a couple of years ago, last time.</p>
<p>And he brought me to his house and we spoke and just, he said,</p>
<p>I just remember forever, he told me, you want&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the story with Winnie the Pooh.</p>
<p>And he said, you want a tea with milk or with honey?</p>
<p>And my answer was exactly the same as Winnie the Pooh.</p>
<p>I did not know Winnie the Pooh at that time.</p>
<p>I said, okay, all of the above, please, because&hellip;</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because we were hungry.</p>
<p>Very simple.</p>
<p>And he spoke to me and he started working.</p>
<p>It was and I made my first, actually, paper.</p>
<p>You wrote your first paper and that&rsquo;s who you were?</p>
<p>And that was on plasma?</p>
<p>It was on plasma.</p>
<p>But then in the half of a year, he told me that he likes what we are doing,</p>
<p>but he will be unable to help me in the life because I&rsquo;m Jewish.</p>
<p>And for a Jewish person, even like absolutely brilliant,</p>
<p>to get inside of Kurchatov, you have to have stronger helpers.</p>
<p>And he recommend me to meet Vladimir Rusanov and Valeriy Asov at that moment.</p>
<p>So it was a moment when I start&hellip;</p>
<p>Two names I know well, because Rusanov is this legendary&hellip;</p>
<p>So because of you, I seem to have met a lot of people from Vestiakh.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And much like MIT, they&rsquo;re never shy about telling you that they&rsquo;re from Vestiakh.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of pride.</p>
<p>So I know Rusanov well, maybe you can tell about him.</p>
<p>The other guy&hellip;</p>
<p>Valeriy Legasov.</p>
<p>Legasov, a lot of people these days know from the show of Chernobyl,</p>
<p>but he obviously has deep roots in Kurchatov and is a very also interesting person.</p>
<p>So, okay, so Rusanov, who&rsquo;s this legendary human that I&rsquo;ve heard so much about?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>You know that plasma, fusion plasma, it is not only like making a stock mark,</p>
<p>but it is diagnostics, it&rsquo;s a measurement, characterization.</p>
<p>So the most challenging is how to measure it.</p>
<p>So Rusanov was world accepted as a father of plasma diagnostics.</p>
<p>So he was a very, very, very nice person working with plasma diagnostics,</p>
<p>both theory and experiments.</p>
<p>And at that time, in 1973 approximately,</p>
<p>he decided, he was asked by Legasov to start plasma chemistry,</p>
<p>not plasma physics, but plasma chemistry,</p>
<p>because they wanted to dissociate uranium hexafluoride and plutonium hexafluoride,</p>
<p>and they were unable to do it without, like in traditional ways,</p>
<p>and they decided to try plasma.</p>
<p>So, and Rusanov agreed to take a lead in plasma chemistry.</p>
<p>And at that point, you see that I was in a good moment, you know, in a good place.</p>
<p>So I was lucky, actually, because all of them, they were physicists,</p>
<p>especially Rusanov, deeply, deeply, deeply physicist.</p>
<p>And he needs help from a good young person who is not afraid of chemistry, being physicist.</p>
<p>So he looked around, and Rudakov told him that there is a young guy,</p>
<p>a very interesting personality, he&rsquo;s good in physics,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s in love with chemistry also, so try him.</p>
<p>And to me, he said, go to Rusanov.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a tough guy, but he will be able to help you,</p>
<p>because to help you to stay, to go further in your life,</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s a close friend working together with Legasov,</p>
<p>and Legasov was associate director, vice president of Kurchatov Institute.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s how it all started, and they asked me a couple of things.</p>
<p>Can you do this, can you do that in chemistry?</p>
<p>So it is just physicists and talking chemistry.</p>
<p>So let me step up, because I&rsquo;d like to step back in a little bit</p>
<p>to talk about what is plasma, even.</p>
<p>But before all that, let&rsquo;s talk about Rusanov.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s step away from science.</p>
<p>What impact did he have on you as a human being?</p>
<p>What memories do you have of him that you love or hate, or both?</p>
<p>You know, I would say the best word would be both,</p>
<p>because do you remember Rusanov?</p>
<p>Not much.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to know what I remember, because I was told so many stories.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the personality, he&rsquo;s the personality.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s extremely tough, very quiet.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s mostly not talking.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s only looking at you, always in your eyes.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, well, that&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s brilliant? Smart?</p>
<p>He was absolutely smart, absolutely brilliant, and very tough.</p>
<p>And tough, and so you have to&hellip;</p>
<p>Basically, that makes for a great advisor, because&hellip;</p>
<p>This is a person to be afraid of.</p>
<p>Yeah, and you basically, for the rest of your life,</p>
<p>are trying to prove yourself to him.</p>
<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s exactly the case with academician Vladimir Rusanov.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the personality.</p>
<p>Is there a memory, a story that stands out to you,</p>
<p>maybe that represents him?</p>
<p>Well, without going to science, right?</p>
<p>Without going.</p>
<p>I remember one story just forever.</p>
<p>One of the&hellip;</p>
<p>I was already not a postdoc, well, graded student.</p>
<p>So it was one undergraduate student, you remember, from third grade,</p>
<p>in Moscow Institute of Psychology,</p>
<p>and she was supposed to start, you know, after vacation.</p>
<p>But something happened, and she came about one week later.</p>
<p>So I&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s her advisor, which is another famous scientist,</p>
<p>and I was in the office of Rusanov.</p>
<p>So he brought this girl, and it&rsquo;s a nice girl.</p>
<p>Not so many girls in MIPT, in PhysTech, not so many girls.</p>
<p>So she came to this office, and Rusanov, he just looked at her,</p>
<p>like a snake, you know, like look at her without any words</p>
<p>for about maybe 20-30 seconds, just look at her eyes.</p>
<p>And then she said, he said,</p>
<p>your colleagues, they start working one week ago.</p>
<p>Your what?</p>
<p>Your colleagues, well, other students.</p>
<p>Other students, they are already working, start working one week ago.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all he said.</p>
<p>And kept looking at her.</p>
<p>Just staring.</p>
<p>And staring, right.</p>
<p>And she, you know, like&hellip;</p>
<p>Tears.</p>
<p>Started going from her face, and it was like a torture.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t say anything.</p>
<p>Torture by silence and staring.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good advice.</p>
<p>Maybe like three minutes.</p>
<p>But even for me, it was like maybe one hour.</p>
<p>For her, maybe it&rsquo;s like a whole life.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go to the most important question.</p>
<p>How did you meet mom?</p>
<p>So this is before Kurchatov, I suppose, or around that time?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, no, it is already, I met mom in 1973.</p>
<p>Which is second, third, fourth year of yours?</p>
<p>It was my third year.</p>
<p>No, it was my fourth year, actually, already.</p>
<p>And for mom, it was the second one.</p>
<p>She was there.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I told you that it&rsquo;s like three percent.</p>
<p>So she was one of the girls.</p>
<p>One of the special things.</p>
<p>In this special, and yeah, and she survived this kind of also super training.</p>
<p>Survived the first year.</p>
<p>She survived everything, yeah, I mean.</p>
<p>So how did you, okay, so there you are, part of the 97%.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>With a giant ego, as you can already tell.</p>
<p>By the way, does your ego serve you well?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll talk about it a little bit more.</p>
<p>Yeah, actually, yes, I think yes.</p>
<p>What about, so in science, yes, I think people will hear that you have a bit of an ego.</p>
<p>But I think it&rsquo;s deserved.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re, it&rsquo;s the same with Feynman.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same with Leonard Susskind.</p>
<p>A lot of physicists have this weird dance with ego.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a useful weapon when you wield it cautiously.</p>
<p>But did it help you in terms of, with mom?</p>
<p>I would not say so.</p>
<p>Confidence.</p>
<p>Well, the most difficult is, you know, to go to this, because it&rsquo;s a boy.</p>
<p>So, and girls, they live separately in different, like, place.</p>
<p>Is there alligators and, or, like, what?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, you have to, you have to&hellip;</p>
<p>Be clever?</p>
<p>How to get to this, like, a place, I mean.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So what happened that, on their floor, something disappeared.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, some money or whatever, or some books or something.</p>
<p>And a friend of mine, he was, you know, like a, how to say, druzhinniki, we used to say.</p>
<p>So he was like a student responsible for, like, everything should be nice.</p>
<p>So I said that, I will help you.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go to these girls and let&rsquo;s try to help them.</p>
<p>So we come to them, start helping, and spend then the whole night reading poetry.</p>
<p>Just reading poetry.</p>
<p>I think with tea, that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>Reading poetry with tea.</p>
<p>It was you and who else?</p>
<p>Me, mom, and two of my friends.</p>
<p>And it was also two other girls, which live in the same room.</p>
<p>So do you remember what poems you were reading?</p>
<p>Is there something?</p>
<p>If you can imagine, if we are talking about eight hours, or whatever, seven hours.</p>
<p>So it was a lot of poetry.</p>
<p>But is there something from that period that stands out to you?</p>
<p>Maybe as poetry that you were reading.</p>
<p>Not something you&rsquo;ve written for mom yet.</p>
<p>But do you remember from that night?</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s an important night, right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You remember what kind of tea?</p>
<p>The cheap one, because that&rsquo;s the only stuff we used to have.</p>
<p>No, no vodka.</p>
<p>So it was&hellip;</p>
<p>No, no.</p>
<p>So, okay, tea and&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like it was offensive for girls.</p>
<p>We had a huge respect to them, you know.</p>
<p>And then gentlemen don&rsquo;t drink vodka in front of girls.</p>
<p>So&hellip;</p>
<p>At least in the beginning.</p>
<p>So when did you first fall in love with mom?</p>
<p>You know, when you have, like you said, it&rsquo;s 97%.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s being recorded.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s immediately.</p>
<p>One, two, three, yes.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So, but&hellip;</p>
<p>She was beautiful and she is beautiful.</p>
<p>And it was December 14th.</p>
<p>And still, even now, we celebrate this date.</p>
<p>December 14th is when you met?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s this poetry stuff.</p>
<p>But it was the same day.</p>
<p>Wait, December 14th, two days ago.</p>
<p>So we celebrated 46 years.</p>
<p>46 years since you met.</p>
<p>Of this day with tea and poetry.</p>
<p>But&hellip;</p>
<p>My guitar, also guitar.</p>
<p>I think, yes, also guitar.</p>
<p>And when you say guitar, I mean, there&rsquo;s a barred tradition.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s basically poetry to music.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s kind of lyrics is really important.</p>
<p>Yeah, I would say it was 96%.</p>
<p>I mean, it was mostly lyrics and guitar.</p>
<p>It was just like&hellip;</p>
<p>How did you win her over?</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s our&hellip;</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your secret?</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>How&rsquo;d you do it?</p>
<p>Actually, also, I became her mentor.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Which made my life a little bit easier.</p>
<p>And, you know, I started with poetry and I end up with science.</p>
<p>And then, actually&hellip;</p>
<p>And we stayed together.</p>
<p>We married three years after that.</p>
<p>Do you remember any poems you&rsquo;ve written her?</p>
<p>Well, I&hellip;</p>
<p>Of course, you&rsquo;ve written her hundreds of poems through the years, but at that moment.</p>
<p>I would say, like, reciting all these life poems is probably not the best stuff to do now.</p>
<p>It should be a special discussion about that, probably together with her.</p>
<p>But I can say that I have a couple of these&hellip;</p>
<p>Not book, but booklets of poetry.</p>
<p>But it is already not the same.</p>
<p>I was already not the same as I was in high school.</p>
<p>Which means that at that time, already, most of my poetry was&hellip;</p>
<p>I would say not funny, but more like&hellip;</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Witty, playful.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>When did you know you will marry her?</p>
<p>When did you know that, you know, sort of, this is gonna be&hellip;</p>
<p>This is the one.</p>
<p>You remember this one, two, three?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Maybe not during first five minutes, but maybe after 20 minutes.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna marry that one.</p>
<p>Yeah, it is very&hellip;</p>
<p>I mean, she is beautiful, and she was even&hellip;</p>
<p>Well, she was younger.</p>
<p>Me too.</p>
<p>So just almost immediately&hellip;</p>
<p>But it was clear that we cannot do it, you know, immediately.</p>
<p>So we were waiting until I graduate from&hellip;</p>
<p>Not undergraduate, from master level.</p>
<p>Because, you know, in Soviet Union it was undergraduate plus master.</p>
<p>It was like higher education, and after that it was PhD level.</p>
<p>So just we wait until I&rsquo;m done with master.</p>
<p>When did you first learn that you will be a father?</p>
<p>So for people who don&rsquo;t know, I have an older brother,</p>
<p>uglier, fatter, stupider brother named Greg.</p>
<p>Oh, he&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>Just uglier.</p>
<p>No, he&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s 1977.</p>
<p>He was born in 1978.</p>
<p>So it was not an easy moment for me.</p>
<p>I would say even very difficult moment, because it was a concept in Soviet Union</p>
<p>which is difficult to understand here.</p>
<p>The so-called propiska is just even not possible to translate,</p>
<p>which means that you have to have a special, absolutely complicated permission,</p>
<p>enormously complicated permission to live in Moscow and Leningrad,</p>
<p>which is in St. Petersburg now.</p>
<p>So to do that, you either have to be born there,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s it actually.</p>
<p>So it was closed cities.</p>
<p>So and I was from Kiev, and mom, she was, and she is from Middle Asia.</p>
<p>So just how to do that?</p>
<p>In 1976, in 1977, I was like the first grade of PhD, first year of PhD.</p>
<p>And without this permission to live in Moscow,</p>
<p>so just it was a difficult moment.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a practical thing, because you want to stay in Moscow longer term.</p>
<p>Because, yeah, because in Soviet Union, Moscow, it was like a number one place,</p>
<p>but not so easy to have this permission.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s extremely complicated.</p>
<p>And because mom is originally from a different area of the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s complications, bureaucracy, all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Mom, she was born, she lived in the area of the first uranium,</p>
<p>the most important uranium mines in Soviet Union.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s, she&rsquo;s from Warsaw.</p>
<p>So how did&hellip;</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where you born, he was born.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>A little bit nuclear.</p>
<p>That explains so much.</p>
<p>So how did it feel like when Greg was born?</p>
<p>I mean, just becoming a father.</p>
<p>What was that story like?</p>
<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s a pain.</p>
<p>I was very much, well, obviously I was very happy.</p>
<p>But I was nervous about future.</p>
<p>Because future was not clear at that time.</p>
<p>Not clear at all.</p>
<p>About this time, my situation was actually very sophisticated.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s a little bit long story.</p>
<p>But what happened that I get sick.</p>
<p>And they didn&rsquo;t know where to put me.</p>
<p>It was infectious.</p>
<p>And finally I end up in the house of Sakharov, which is interesting moment.</p>
<p>And it was mixed all together with Greg birth, with me being sick, with this Sakharov,</p>
<p>all together, whatever.</p>
<p>It was like a&hellip;</p>
<p>Just a mess, a stressful mess.</p>
<p>It was just a stressful mess.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And when I came to, again, to this Chkalovsk, to the city in Middle Asia, near,</p>
<p>now they call it Khodzhent.</p>
<p>So it is near Khodzhent.</p>
<p>Well, I was very happy.</p>
<p>And one of the first&hellip;</p>
<p>At that point, I wrote my first, not book, but chapter in the book.</p>
<p>What was the topic?</p>
<p>Plasma chemistry.</p>
<p>Plasma chemistry.</p>
<p>And topic of my chapter, it was synthesis of nitrogen oxide from air.</p>
<p>And there is a very famous, I love it, picture of Greg on the wall, when he just,</p>
<p>you know, has maybe a couple of weeks.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s reading the book.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s in front, and he&rsquo;s just like so much interest,</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s reading this plasma chemistry book.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s a good picture.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good picture, right.</p>
<p>So how did it feel like&hellip;</p>
<p>So obviously Greg is a disappointment.</p>
<p>So how did it feel like when I was finally born?</p>
<p>Oh, with you, it was way easier.</p>
<p>And we were way more happier, because it was 1983.</p>
<p>So which means that we were already in Moscow.</p>
<p>We got this propiska, we got this permission.</p>
<p>And we got our apartment.</p>
<p>So just everything was so nice and so beautiful.</p>
<p>And, you know, cherry on top of this cake, it was you.</p>
<p>And the only funny story, which is like always mom, she used to say,</p>
<p>is like, for some reason, I don&rsquo;t know even why,</p>
<p>but everybody was sure that you are a girl.</p>
<p>Not you, but like that it&rsquo;s a girl.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a girl, yeah.</p>
<p>And everything was prepared for a girl.</p>
<p>And we were staying near this clinic.</p>
<p>And me and Greg and just&hellip;</p>
<p>And it was now that it is a boy.</p>
<p>And Greg, he mentioned this famous phrase</p>
<p>that he&rsquo;s so much happy that you are a boy.</p>
<p>And, you know, the story also that he was five years old.</p>
<p>And he was, for some reason, sure that men,</p>
<p>they make boys, and women, they make girls.</p>
<p>And he was so much surprised.</p>
<p>And he said that, mom, she&rsquo;s so good.</p>
<p>Yeah, he was impressed.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>That she could make a boy.</p>
<p>A boy.</p>
<p>So that&hellip;</p>
<p>Were you ready to be a father, would you say?</p>
<p>You know, being a father, it&rsquo;s a big commitment.</p>
<p>Big, big, big commitment, because now it&rsquo;s a real family.</p>
<p>When Greg was born, it was like, it was a mess.</p>
<p>So it was very challenging.</p>
<p>It was very difficult.</p>
<p>When you were, like, fun and nice, and everybody was so happy.</p>
<p>And even if you look at pictures, you know,</p>
<p>like pictures with you, that&rsquo;s just&hellip;</p>
<p>Yeah, smiling is happiness.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a smiling.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a happiness.</p>
<p>It brings joy to the world.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And by the way, that&rsquo;s the way you were when you were, like,</p>
<p>you were always, you know, you wake up and you smile.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good sign.</p>
<p>Very good sign.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s go.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go.</p>
<p>So I wanted to be a psychiatrist, so let me psychoanalyze you.</p>
<p>Do you think you were a good dad?</p>
<p>Who?</p>
<p>Well, to be honest, it&rsquo;s not for me to judge.</p>
<p>What I can tell you, that my whole life, I just tried.</p>
<p>Sometimes more successful, sometimes less successful to be a good dad.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not for me to judge.</p>
<p>I mean, you know, I can give an example.</p>
<p>Like, when Greg was very young, for me, like,</p>
<p>very important was Landau books.</p>
<p>And I had these 10 books of Landau.</p>
<p>By the way, they are&hellip;</p>
<p>Oh, no, they are not here.</p>
<p>They are in my office.</p>
<p>And, you know, that&rsquo;s the books which I read and just, I put my&hellip;</p>
<p>Yeah, sweat, blood, and tears.</p>
<p>Sweat, and blood, and tears, right, into this book.</p>
<p>And what Greg did, he just took these books and he took, like, this,</p>
<p>for a master, what is that?</p>
<p>Like, markers.</p>
<p>Markers, markers.</p>
<p>And he put everything around this, like, the cover of this.</p>
<p>He drew on it.</p>
<p>No, he just&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like graffiti.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not, like, it&rsquo;s all over this.</p>
<p>And it was, how to say, you know, for me, it was&hellip;</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s a sacred document.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s sacred, I mean.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And I was just, I remember this moment, I was so much not happy.</p>
<p>Just, you know, and I just tried to explain and, I mean&hellip;</p>
<p>And I even&hellip;</p>
<p>And Greg, he keeps saying, even now, that he was sure that he&rsquo;s doing something good.</p>
<p>That he&rsquo;s just, he knows that I love these books.</p>
<p>So he tried to make them even, you know&hellip;</p>
<p>Prettier.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>So what I&rsquo;m trying to say that&hellip;</p>
<p>Welcome to being a dad, right there.</p>
<p>Yes, yes, yes.</p>
<p>So if you can go back and do something different in terms of being a dad, what would you?</p>
<p>Is there something you regret?</p>
<p>Well, you know, I would say&hellip;</p>
<p>People, they&rsquo;re different.</p>
<p>Some people, they always, they want a different life and they&hellip;</p>
<p>Sure, for some reason, that if they start again, it would be better.</p>
<p>It is not my case.</p>
<p>For some reason, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Maybe it is just like internal strengths, just to&hellip;</p>
<p>Like you mentioned about Feynman.</p>
<p>But I just always think that it&rsquo;s not my case.</p>
<p>I just always try to protect myself and family and just&hellip;</p>
<p>I was sure, like my father during the war, that if I am strong, everything will be good.</p>
<p>But&hellip;</p>
<p>And as a result, believe me or not, and it&rsquo;s psychologically&hellip;</p>
<p>It helped me psychologically significantly.</p>
<p>I really believe that I am always right.</p>
<p>Which is strange, maybe.</p>
<p>But it is a way to protect myself, I don&rsquo;t know, and protect family.</p>
<p>So when you ask me what you would be differently, nothing.</p>
<p>My feeling always is that my son is the best one.</p>
<p>I always try to give advice, sometimes more than necessary.</p>
<p>And probably it&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m doing that wrong, but I cannot do differently.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure that I&rsquo;m right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a kind of defense mechanism.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a defense mechanism.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve done&hellip;</p>
<p>You, our family, have done a lot to make a better life for us, for me.</p>
<p>And I think I&rsquo;ve seen you work very hard to take steps through life</p>
<p>to make a better life for all of us.</p>
<p>We took risks many times.</p>
<p>And there is a feeling that it looks like everything is okay.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So while creating, sort of creating, taking risks,</p>
<p>creating opportunities for our family, for me, for my brother,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s, to me always, I felt a distance.</p>
<p>So what if I told you you felt distant to me as a father?</p>
<p>And then I never really felt close to you.</p>
<p>To this day.</p>
<p>Do you think that&rsquo;s true?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>What I can say that I tried as much as possible</p>
<p>to be as good father as I can.</p>
<p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s difficult to combine the system with this self-protection, like you said.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s, you know&hellip;</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s an interesting, it could be a Russian immigrant thing.</p>
<p>It could be a Jewish thing too.</p>
<p>But sort of, say if you&rsquo;re captain of a boat or something,</p>
<p>and so you have somebody precious, your family on the boat,</p>
<p>it seems that you were more focused on just making sure the boat doesn&rsquo;t crash.</p>
<p>Or like, sort of focusing on, or maybe getting a bigger boat,</p>
<p>or for the family, like there&rsquo;s this focus of the journey</p>
<p>and providing and stability and so on,</p>
<p>than not actually, not sitting down and enjoying time on the boat that you&rsquo;ve built.</p>
<p>You know, I have&hellip;</p>
<p>With the family.</p>
<p>I agree with you.</p>
<p>But it is not Russian.</p>
<p>It is not Russian.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a Jewish and it&rsquo;s immigrants.</p>
<p>Because so many times I was very nervous that one thing goes wrong and everything crashes.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a million things in our life.</p>
<p>But I am always feeling that this point is the most dangerous.</p>
<p>Dangerous here.</p>
<p>That is okay.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s dangerous.</p>
<p>So I feel this danger and I&rsquo;m overdoing this nervousness.</p>
<p>And it is always with me.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why&hellip;</p>
<p>Even now, at any point, I&rsquo;m too much nervous.</p>
<p>Because I see, it looks like, my feeling is that like people,</p>
<p>they do not see that this is a deadly point, like a crucial bottleneck or whatever.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And I know that if I say that directly, people, it can be not good.</p>
<p>So I have to play with that in one way or another.</p>
<p>But I would say that it&rsquo;s typical for Jewish people,</p>
<p>because they went through hundreds and hundreds and hundreds,</p>
<p>even a thousand years of problems.</p>
<p>And also for immigrants, because that&rsquo;s immigrant life.</p>
<p>You remember your own story with high school, when you first time came there.</p>
<p>I mean, there is some kind of tiny details which can make your life miserable.</p>
<p>Yeah, middle school.</p>
<p>I mean, that was a particularly interesting moment that I think&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an interesting moment that I don&rsquo;t know how to explore correctly.</p>
<p>Because we came to this country, so I was maybe 13.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even remember.</p>
<p>It was middle school.</p>
<p>And it was a very different culture change.</p>
<p>It was a very, very&hellip;</p>
<p>It was tough.</p>
<p>Very different culture.</p>
<p>And we went to&hellip;</p>
<p>Middle school is tough for people in general.</p>
<p>But I went from having a lot of friends, from culture that I loved somehow deeply,</p>
<p>sort of this math and science that you talked about.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s so many deep friendships to a very shallow place.</p>
<p>And sort of the difference between what, you know, everybody&hellip;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to discount the suffering of people, but I would say I suffered.</p>
<p>You know, you want to be like, that&rsquo;s stupid.</p>
<p>But I really psychologically suffered.</p>
<p>And at the same time, you were sort of totally unable to understand that, obviously.</p>
<p>Because&hellip;</p>
<p>Well, hold on a second.</p>
<p>I think you came to America&hellip;</p>
<p>The step to come to America is a beautiful step of opportunity.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s this dichotomy of&hellip;</p>
<p>Like, to me, that was a horrible thing.</p>
<p>From my own selfish personal little experience,</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t see the&hellip;</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t, you know, at that age, you don&rsquo;t think about the big picture of things.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s an interesting difference.</p>
<p>The step to America is a really interesting step.</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;re sacrificing so much of who you are.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a big, big leap, big leap.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s the good leap for the future of the family, for opportunity,</p>
<p>for building a life together.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s an interesting&hellip;</p>
<p>How did you think about that process?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll talk about it a little bit.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll take a step back and talk about it more as our bigger family.</p>
<p>But as a dad, as a family, not big, but just day to day, how did you&hellip;</p>
<p>That move, how did you experience it?</p>
<p>How did you think about it?</p>
<p>Well, this is a moment when I can read for you a poetry.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, again, it&rsquo;s in Russian.</p>
<p>But I will use&hellip;</p>
<p>No, no, it&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s only a couple of sentences I&rsquo;ll give you from there.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a beautiful, very nice, basically, Jewish poet.</p>
<p>In 1941, beginning of the war, he said,</p>
<p>–ö–æ–≥–¥–∞ –Ω–∞ —Å–º–µ—Ä—Ç—å –∏–¥—É—Ç ‚Äî –ø–æ—é—Ç,</p>
<p>–ê –ø–µ—Ä–µ–¥ —ç—Ç–∏–º –º–æ–∂–Ω–æ –ø–ª–∞–∫–∞—Ç—å,</p>
<p>–í–µ–¥—å —Å–∞–º—ã–π —Ç—Ä—É–¥–Ω—ã–π —á–∞—Å—å –≤ –±–æ—é ‚Äî</p>
<p>–ß–∞—Å—Ç—å –æ–∂–∏–¥–∞–Ω–∏—è –∞—Ç–∞–∫–∏.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s a wonderful poem.</p>
<p>I can read the whole poem later, not with the microphone.</p>
<p>But listen to that.</p>
<p>You are very nervous before, but when it is already attack,</p>
<p>when you are just already in action, you don&rsquo;t think about that.</p>
<p>So this moment of coming to America, the first period,</p>
<p>I was not nervous.</p>
<p>I was like a machine.</p>
<p>I was doing that.</p>
<p>So, yeah, I mean, it&rsquo;s the same.</p>
<p>When you decide the decision is the right one.</p>
<p>Yeah, you see that this poetry, I can just, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s easy to translate it like when you are going to attack,</p>
<p>you are singing.</p>
<p>When you cry, it&rsquo;s before that.</p>
<p>Yeah, the stress, the anxiety, the tears, the worries.</p>
<p>But when you&rsquo;re already there, you believe in your star.</p>
<p>And you go, and you don&rsquo;t think much.</p>
<p>Well, let me pause on this.</p>
<p>Since I asked you if you think you were a good father,</p>
<p>was I a good son?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>The better one than Greg, obviously.</p>
<p>But what would you&hellip;</p>
<p>You know, without any hesitation,</p>
<p>I can say that you were and you are a very good son.</p>
<p>Because you understand.</p>
<p>When you are talking, and it was from the beginning,</p>
<p>you always, even when you&rsquo;re a kid, you&rsquo;re not&hellip;</p>
<p>Kids usually, they think about themselves.</p>
<p>And they see the whole world is rotating around them.</p>
<p>But you were way less.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just, for many years, you just, you saw people around.</p>
<p>You were able to see, okay, this is mother, this is father.</p>
<p>I mean, you just see people, and that&rsquo;s incredible.</p>
<p>Also, just from the first months of your life,</p>
<p>you were laughing, smiling.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And believe me, it is not so many kids are doing that.</p>
<p>Kids are doing that.</p>
<p>Which means that somewhere deeply in your, I don&rsquo;t know where,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s genes probably, I don&rsquo;t know, you were smiling.</p>
<p>So, you know, like when I see a good person or not so good person,</p>
<p>take a look at the person when this person wakes up.</p>
<p>Some people, they wake up and they immediately smile a little bit.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s something, I don&rsquo;t know, it&rsquo;s like a miracle.</p>
<p>So you are, okay, so thank you for being a good son.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Maybe I&rsquo;m not so good father, that&rsquo;s another story, but.</p>
<p>Well, this context makes it much more important for me to criticize you.</p>
<p>It makes it impossible for you to criticize me,</p>
<p>which is exactly how I set it up.</p>
<p>Okay, but so you mentioned Ligasov as one of the people in your story at Kurchatov Institute.</p>
<p>Can you tell the story and your involvement in Chernobyl?</p>
<p>Sort of that played a part in our lives as well.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the story there?</p>
<p>What is Chernobyl for people who don&rsquo;t know?</p>
<p>Yeah, Chernobyl, it&rsquo;s a small city, town with a huge nuclear power plant.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s the place of world ever biggest nuclear severe accident.</p>
<p>The reason of this accident, the best if you know,</p>
<p>but other people, they can watch the movie, which is.</p>
<p>HBO show.</p>
<p>Yeah, HBO show, very good actually.</p>
<p>I did not expect, but it is really very good.</p>
<p>The major reason is they just went through special tests and just testing new regimes.</p>
<p>And they start to decrease activity of reactor very fast.</p>
<p>And the reactor starts dying and they just increase activity.</p>
<p>And then they were unable to stop it.</p>
<p>And the temperature go very high.</p>
<p>Metal clothing start reacting with cooling water, producing hydrogen.</p>
<p>Hydrogen reacts with oxygen.</p>
<p>And it was a huge hydrogen explosion, the so-called DDT.</p>
<p>And because of this explosion, actually the very, very, very, very heavy,</p>
<p>like a tip of the reactor jump up, fell down.</p>
<p>And 40 tons or something like that, it was huge.</p>
<p>Just then destroy the whole reactor and all this nuclear fuel start falling down,</p>
<p>create some critical mass.</p>
<p>And it was a nuclear explosion, but not contained.</p>
<p>So just it was.</p>
<p>What part of the story did the show get right?</p>
<p>And what part of the story does it get wrong in your view?</p>
<p>Just things you&rsquo;ve experienced personally.</p>
<p>No, I just very shortly describe what happened.</p>
<p>That like it was this kind of already nuclear expansion.</p>
<p>And everything from inside was boom, went out.</p>
<p>And actually with the wind make almost a half circle around the world.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s an accident.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>For Institute of Atomic Energy, it was a very big deal.</p>
<p>Because the whole community, the whole country, actually,</p>
<p>they consider that this huge institute is responsible for this accident.</p>
<p>So their action, don&rsquo;t forget, it&rsquo;s a communist country.</p>
<p>They decided it&rsquo;s like an army, that all people, all scientists, they are responsible.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t matter whatever if you&rsquo;re doing plasma or you&rsquo;re doing nuclear reactor,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>You have to go and help.</p>
<p>You want it, you don&rsquo;t want it, you like it, you don&rsquo;t like it.</p>
<p>In the movie, it was shown.</p>
<p>I would say movie is about 97% absolutely right, absolutely correct.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s unbelievable how good they made this, nice they made this movie.</p>
<p>Yeah, from the people, the culture, the scientists, the interaction, the bureaucracy.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>They did not overdo that.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s very easy to go like, ah, it&rsquo;s a communist country, that&rsquo;s why.</p>
<p>And vice versa.</p>
<p>So they did it very good harmony, very good balance.</p>
<p>That was perfect.</p>
<p>What did they get wrong?</p>
<p>Here, at least my impression is that they show the apartment of Legasov.</p>
<p>Legasov was actually almost a copy of real Legasov.</p>
<p>Visually, too?</p>
<p>Yes, yes, yes, yes.</p>
<p>As this actor, he looks like Legasov.</p>
<p>And just, you know, wow, it&rsquo;s just like&hellip;</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a good actor, actually.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good actor.</p>
<p>British.</p>
<p>Yeah, you know, and that&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>But it was shown, that&rsquo;s like a little bit of already American propaganda.</p>
<p>They show this Legasov living in like a small apartment, like smoking cigarettes or&hellip;</p>
<p>No, come on, it was&hellip;</p>
<p>Can you imagine like a vice president of Academy of Sciences,</p>
<p>vice president of Kurchatov Institute?</p>
<p>He lived in an apartment?</p>
<p>Come on.</p>
<p>Especially in the Soviet Union, where that position means you get handed,</p>
<p>given out the apartment.</p>
<p>He lived not in an apartment.</p>
<p>It was like a special house belonging to him, like next door to the institute.</p>
<p>This house did not belong to him.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s where he lived.</p>
<p>So just he lived like in a castle.</p>
<p>And in the movie, it was a little bit not like&hellip;</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your memory of him?</p>
<p>Have you ever met him?</p>
<p>Come on, he&rsquo;s my supervisor.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like Moshe for you.</p>
<p>I had like Rusanov, and like for you, Steve Webber.</p>
<p>And like Legasov for me, it&rsquo;s like Moshe Kam.</p>
<p>So did you have a chance to see Moshe Kam?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You see, you&rsquo;re laughing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like each other day.</p>
<p>Every day, yeah.</p>
<p>My feeling is he was very good in nuclear chemistry.</p>
<p>He was a member and very significant member of Communist Party.</p>
<p>The difference with Rusanov, Rusanov was</p>
<p>not very much liking Communist Party.</p>
<p>While Legasov, he was.</p>
<p>So he was a secretary of a Communist Party organization of Kurchatov Institute for a</p>
<p>couple of years.</p>
<p>So this kind of personality.</p>
<p>So he was a great scientist, very interesting, very bright.</p>
<p>But at the same time, he was a communist.</p>
<p>And he kind of believed in these communist ideas.</p>
<p>And he took all that responsibility very close to his heart.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s exactly like it is shown in the movie.</p>
<p>Especially when the director of the Chernobyl station made an incredibly strange mistake.</p>
<p>Because the reactor was already destroyed.</p>
<p>You remember my explanation.</p>
<p>But what they see, the temperature is going up.</p>
<p>And his decision was, you know, you are in artificial intelligence, not so much in physics</p>
<p>and chemistry.</p>
<p>But if temperature is going up, what people do if they are not professionals?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s put water there.</p>
<p>And he made a decision to put enormous amount of water into the reactor to cool it down.</p>
<p>But people, they&rsquo;re talking, come on, I just, we have seen a couple of seconds ago, there</p>
<p>is no reactor.</p>
<p>There is nothing to cool down because it&rsquo;s, now can you imagine this huge temperature</p>
<p>and you put water into this huge temperature and metals, metals immediately react with</p>
<p>water producing hydrogen.</p>
<p>So, actually what they did, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s extremely bad and it&rsquo;s nicely</p>
<p>shown in the movie when they made a decision for three people to go inside, under the reactor</p>
<p>and open the valve to let this hot water, to let this water out.</p>
<p>And these people, they did it.</p>
<p>Obviously, it was clear that they were going to die.</p>
<p>Do you think the accident could have been avoided?</p>
<p>The Chernobyl accident?</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s so deeply interlinked to Soviet culture, to say no, why no?</p>
<p>You know, how to say, is it possible to be sure that it will be no fire in the city?</p>
<p>It is, it&rsquo;s very low probability, it&rsquo;s a, it&rsquo;s actually a coincidence, it&rsquo;s a couple</p>
<p>of stuff with extremely low probability happened at the same time, but it was really important</p>
<p>stuff.</p>
<p>Chernobyl happened, first of all, because it was no automatic system of control.</p>
<p>It was impossible, if let&rsquo;s say, already accident, there is no automatic system to</p>
<p>stop it.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s a huge reactor, very heavy, like very, very, very heavy and big, way bigger</p>
<p>than reactors which we have here in the United States.</p>
<p>So, this is way more difficult to control.</p>
<p>So, I would say it was clear for many people that sooner or later it will be this accident.</p>
<p>And actually, it is a copy of accident which happened in America, in Trimai Island.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very similar, but American accident was more, better controlled, so it was not so</p>
<p>huge, it&rsquo;s still severe accident.</p>
<p>Well, Legasov, he took this stuff very close to his heart, and it is very nicely shown</p>
<p>in the movie.</p>
<p>And actually, that&rsquo;s why he suicided.</p>
<p>He took his own life, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And by the way, he tried twice, first time not successful, and second one, second time.</p>
<p>So, there&rsquo;s a journey of suffering there afterwards.</p>
<p>He wore the burden of credit for that, the responsibility.</p>
<p>And yes, because actually, he was claiming that these reactors are the safest in the</p>
<p>world, and they are, but they are way more resistive to small accidents, but they have</p>
<p>this tiny chance of severe accident.</p>
<p>Even now, a lot of these reactors are still the same and still around.</p>
<p>Okay, let&rsquo;s get into the fun.</p>
<p>Can you tell me, what is plasma?</p>
<p>The simple explanation would be like, the plasma, it is what we have in fluorescent</p>
<p>lamps.</p>
<p>If you look around in your room, it is something you have in all kind of sources, like most</p>
<p>of monitors, TV screens, etc.</p>
<p>Significant number of them, it&rsquo;s plasma.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s plasma?</p>
<p>Plasma is ionized gas.</p>
<p>What does it mean?</p>
<p>We have gas around us, and let&rsquo;s say with electric field, electrons are separated from</p>
<p>ions.</p>
<p>So, just you take electron out of molecule.</p>
<p>So, molecule becomes positive ion, and electron is separate.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s an ion?</p>
<p>Ion, it&rsquo;s if you take an atom or molecule and take one electron out, would stay there.</p>
<p>So, ion, it is like an atom or molecule after this robbery, when they lost an electron.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s interesting about an ion?</p>
<p>Okay, wait a second, probably when you apply electric field, whoever is lighter, take energy</p>
<p>immediately, it&rsquo;s energized very fast.</p>
<p>So, ions, they stay regular, usually they stay cold.</p>
<p>Because they are heavy, they are not very much moving, so they stay cold.</p>
<p>While electrons, they are energized almost immediately.</p>
<p>And their temperature in most of plasmas, whatever you do, electron temperature is usually</p>
<p>on ballpark, it&rsquo;s about 10,000, 15,000 Kelvin or Celsius, which means 20,000, 30,000 Fahrenheit.</p>
<p>Hot.</p>
<p>So, electrons are very, very, very, very, very hot.</p>
<p>And ions, like gas, they&rsquo;re usually, in most of cases, they&rsquo;re cold.</p>
<p>So, if I take like a cell phone and touch the screen, well, inside you have, very often</p>
<p>you have electrons with a temperature 20, 30,000 Fahrenheit.</p>
<p>But you cannot feel it.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s one electron per million of molecules.</p>
<p>So, it&rsquo;s not so many of them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, let&rsquo;s say, city of Philadelphia.</p>
<p>Do we have billionaires in the city of Philadelphia?</p>
<p>Probably.</p>
<p>Maybe one or two, but it&rsquo;s not so much easy to meet them on the street, because it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>only one or two for a huge city.</p>
<p>So, the same story here.</p>
<p>So, plasma, it is very energized electrons and usually relatively cold gas.</p>
<p>But these electrons, they can do a lot.</p>
<p>Like these billionaires in Philadelphia.</p>
<p>If you have like a couple of these billionaires, they can do a lot.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s only two of them.</p>
<p>But actually, they can influence life in the city more than everything else.</p>
<p>Because they have abilities.</p>
<p>The same story there.</p>
<p>So, electrons, depending on gas, they are able to create very active species.</p>
<p>So, they can be used as a source of light, like fluorescent lamps.</p>
<p>They can be used to three different materials.</p>
<p>So, most of synthetic&hellip;</p>
<p>No, I would say 100% of synthetic materials, they are treated before coloring.</p>
<p>Because like, you have a nice black tie.</p>
<p>But how to make tie black?</p>
<p>If it is synthetic, if it is natural, it&rsquo;s a little bit easier.</p>
<p>But if it is synthetic material, and if you try, you know, paint synthetic material,</p>
<p>you know, paint doesn&rsquo;t stick to it.</p>
<p>So, you plasma treat it, these electrons activate the surface,</p>
<p>and colors, they start sticking to the surface.</p>
<p>What does it mean to activate a surface?</p>
<p>So, there&rsquo;s a lot of plasma is interacting somehow with the surface.</p>
<p>Whether it&rsquo;s human skin or it&rsquo;s some kind of surface.</p>
<p>So, what does it mean to treat a surface?</p>
<p>Okay, I&rsquo;ll try.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little bit more difficult question.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s, you know, if you have polymer, like in the case of your tie,</p>
<p>if you have like a polymer, what this electron does is just create OH,</p>
<p>and this OH take hydrogen out of your tie.</p>
<p>And this is a opening bond, and usually oxygen stick to there and become polar.</p>
<p>So, you cover the surface with the polar groups, which are always sticky.</p>
<p>So, that&rsquo;s what is going on.</p>
<p>You just take one atom out, you have free bound oxygen there,</p>
<p>polar groups, you stick, you can paint.</p>
<p>If you put a droplet of whiskey on the surface of glass,</p>
<p>it will stay like a droplet.</p>
<p>But if you just plasma treat this glass, and then you put droplet,</p>
<p>droplet will go, oops, immediately, cover a very significant area.</p>
<p>Okay, so let&rsquo;s step back a little bit.</p>
<p>So, there is a solid liquid gas, you said, it&rsquo;s ionized gas.</p>
<p>Why is plasma sometimes called the fourth state of matter?</p>
<p>So, what&rsquo;s the difference between gas and ionized gas,</p>
<p>such that it&rsquo;s a fundamental difference?</p>
<p>It is a fundamental difference.</p>
<p>Because, like, what is going on, that this ionized gas</p>
<p>immediately has very different behavior.</p>
<p>The word plasma was actually created just because of similarity with blood plasma.</p>
<p>So, like, you ask the difference between plasma and gas,</p>
<p>it is about the same difference, like, difference between water and blood.</p>
<p>So, species inside of blood, they&rsquo;re very much interacting with each other,</p>
<p>while water, they&rsquo;re not much interacting.</p>
<p>So, why Irwin Langmuir, in 1934-36, he started using the word plasma versus ionized gas,</p>
<p>because he said, take a look, take a look, take a look,</p>
<p>these species, they interact with each other.</p>
<p>Yeah, I didn&rsquo;t know that.</p>
<p>So, there&rsquo;s echoes, connections to inspiration from blood plasma.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s because of the interactive elements.</p>
<p>Way more than that.</p>
<p>So, the guy who just Nobel Prize laureate, Irwin Langmuir,</p>
<p>was the first to analyze, basically, interaction,</p>
<p>plasma interaction with surface.</p>
<p>So, you can say that he&rsquo;s like a father of modern electronics, hardware.</p>
<p>So, he come up with this word, he said, take a look,</p>
<p>this plasma is kind of funny, it looks like a blood plasma.</p>
<p>And people, they start, like, using this phrase like a joke,</p>
<p>then, you know, like, everybody&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s stuck.</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s really interesting.</p>
<p>Okay, so, you said electrons, really hot.</p>
<p>So, traditionally, plasma is supposed to be very high energy, very hot.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>So, you said&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s electrons.</p>
<p>Well, there is a hot plasma and cold plasma.</p>
<p>Okay, in hot plasma, everything is hot.</p>
<p>So, if you have more electrons, and they are able to heat up the whole gas,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a hot plasma, like solar plasma.</p>
<p>The sun.</p>
<p>Or sun, solar plasma, sun.</p>
<p>And in this case, temperature is very high, fusion plasma.</p>
<p>So, just everything is very hot.</p>
<p>In most of engineering plasmas today, including your cell phones,</p>
<p>including fluorescent lamps, et cetera, et cetera,</p>
<p>in this case, only electrons, they are hot.</p>
<p>And they are unable to heat up everybody.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like these couple of billionaires in the city of middle-class people.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And, but, these electrons, they are&hellip;</p>
<p>If it is air, for example, they just&hellip;</p>
<p>Electrons, they react with oxygen, making atomic oxygen.</p>
<p>Atomic oxygen immediately produces ozone.</p>
<p>So, atomic oxygen sticks to O2, creating ozone.</p>
<p>By the way, ozone means, I think in Latin, means a smell.</p>
<p>So, the name of the guy who first saw that, it was Siemens.</p>
<p>If you remember, company Siemens.</p>
<p>So, that&rsquo;s the creator of this company, because he was the first one</p>
<p>to understand this ozone and said, wow, it smells.</p>
<p>Then they use like a Latin or whatever word for that, ozone.</p>
<p>And they start using ozone for water cleaning.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So, what&rsquo;s hot plasma and what&rsquo;s cold plasma?</p>
<p>So, you said in the cold plasma, the electron,</p>
<p>like the billionaires, is the only thing that stays hot.</p>
<p>So, what&hellip;</p>
<p>Hot plasma, everybody billionaires.</p>
<p>And so, in terms of applications, in terms of theoretical physics underpinning,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the difference between hot plasma and cold plasma?</p>
<p>Because there&rsquo;s entire groups of researchers that work on that.</p>
<p>Yes, yes.</p>
<p>You know, the fundamental difference is when everything is 10,000 degrees,</p>
<p>what you can do with this material, with this plasma, if everything is 10,000,</p>
<p>like a 10,000 Kelvin, like a 20,000 Fahrenheit, what you can do?</p>
<p>I mean, that stuff melts everything and convert everything into vapor.</p>
<p>So, scientifically, it&rsquo;s way easier, because it&rsquo;s like close to thermodynamic equilibrium.</p>
<p>So, it&rsquo;s just very, very, very hot substance.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>20,000 degrees.</p>
<p>But how many applications?</p>
<p>Applications, the major application is if you want to melt something,</p>
<p>which require temperature above 2,000 Celsius.</p>
<p>Which is what? Is this torches?</p>
<p>So, if you want to cut metal.</p>
<p>Metal, you can actually, you can cut metal with&hellip;</p>
<p>Most of metals, they&rsquo;re just, you know, they melt at the level of below 2,000.</p>
<p>So, for these metals, with some exceptions, but for these metals,</p>
<p>fire, you know, combustion, torches, they&rsquo;re okay.</p>
<p>Now, if you want to melt something which is impossible to melt, like a special hard ceramics,</p>
<p>if you cannot melt it with anything, first of all, why do you need it?</p>
<p>Why do you need to melt something which is impossible to melt?</p>
<p>Uh-huh.</p>
<p>If you, let&rsquo;s say, if you want to protect your airplane,</p>
<p>your airplane, it&rsquo;s a good idea to cover airplane with a thin layer of a substance,</p>
<p>which is impossible to melt, which is not afraid of anything.</p>
<p>Not afraid of lightning, not afraid of anything.</p>
<p>How to do that?</p>
<p>How to do that?</p>
<p>You have to melt, you have to cover it with this material.</p>
<p>But to cover, you have to melt it.</p>
<p>Now, how to melt something which is impossible to melt?</p>
<p>Well, you have to take plasma.</p>
<p>So, plasma goes, hot thermal plasma goes to this huge temperature.</p>
<p>Then you put this powder, you melt it, and you spray.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s thermal plasma?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the hot kind of plasma?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a high-temperature plasma.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So, what&rsquo;s cold plasma then?</p>
<p>And what kind of temperatures are we talking about?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s this world, in terms of applications and theory,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s now fundamentally different from the hot kind?</p>
<p>Cold plasma, it is, it&rsquo;s a situation when you have electrons,</p>
<p>only electrons are hot, and they generate a lot of active species.</p>
<p>Radicals, atoms, so they can treat different materials,</p>
<p>they can make very sophisticated structures,</p>
<p>but temperature is low, so you do not damage.</p>
<p>So, let&rsquo;s say, jumping to artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>If you are talking about computer, how to make a computer?</p>
<p>How to make these wafers?</p>
<p>How to make these chips?</p>
<p>You have to be able to dig tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny ditches.</p>
<p>How to do that?</p>
<p>You have to have, you cannot use mechanical devices,</p>
<p>so you have to have something different, beams, lasers.</p>
<p>No, because laser, it&rsquo;s heating, it&rsquo;s temperature up,</p>
<p>but you cannot take, if you just use laser,</p>
<p>you will, if you go to temperature, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>1,000 degrees, you will damage your phone,</p>
<p>cannot withstand this temperature, the same computer.</p>
<p>So, that&rsquo;s why there is no alternative today,</p>
<p>only cold plasma, to make, I would say,</p>
<p>vast majority of electronics, devices.</p>
<p>So, hardware, it&rsquo;s almost, you say hardware, it is plasma.</p>
<p>So, let me beautifully put, what&rsquo;s, now you said application,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll talk about some applications,</p>
<p>including plasma medicine, but from a,</p>
<p>if you put on your theoretical physicist</p>
<p>or chemist, like fundamental science hat,</p>
<p>what are the interesting problems in plasma?</p>
<p>Mysteries that are not yet understood,</p>
<p>or things that have been recently understood.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen you talk about incredible applications,</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s not cover that first.</p>
<p>Is there some open problems?</p>
<p>How well is it understood, from a theoretical perspective?</p>
<p>Is there some mysteries?</p>
<p>I can give you a couple of examples.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a lot of mysteries, a lot.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because this is strongly non-equilibrium medium.</p>
<p>Almost everything else which we have around us,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an equilibrium.</p>
<p>What does that mean?</p>
<p>What does it mean for a medium to be an equilibrium?</p>
<p>Equilibrium means it has temperature.</p>
<p>Has temperature?</p>
<p>Yeah, some temperature.</p>
<p>Like, this is, let&rsquo;s say, room temperature.</p>
<p>Well, no, I mean, what you mean by that</p>
<p>is there&rsquo;s a uniformity to it.</p>
<p>Uniformity, temperature, not space uniformity,</p>
<p>but homogeneity, like it&rsquo;s, you have temperature.</p>
<p>Now, can you imagine something</p>
<p>which has a couple of different temperatures</p>
<p>at the same point?</p>
<p>Is it possible?</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s what it is.</p>
<p>So electrons are very hot,</p>
<p>but they are inside of gas, and gas is cold,</p>
<p>like people, they are swimming in the ocean,</p>
<p>so temperature of a person is higher.</p>
<p>But here, just temperature is way, way, way higher.</p>
<p>Now, what starts happening in this case,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a lot of funny miracles, a lot of funny miracles.</p>
<p>For example, electron impact creates</p>
<p>excitation of molecules.</p>
<p>So molecules, they start, let&rsquo;s say, oscillate.</p>
<p>And people, they learn that distribution</p>
<p>becomes very strange.</p>
<p>Energy-rich molecules, they take more energy</p>
<p>when they have already something.</p>
<p>And, okay, rich people, they become richer.</p>
<p>And poor people, they become more poor.</p>
<p>Exactly the same thing, they call it capitalism</p>
<p>in molecular life happens in plasma.</p>
<p>So what is going on, you take molecules in plasma,</p>
<p>you excite, and very fast, against all rules</p>
<p>of whatever nature, a couple of molecules,</p>
<p>they have two quantum, and they have more,</p>
<p>and more, and more, and more, and more, and more,</p>
<p>and very soon, like some molecules,</p>
<p>they have everything, and most of molecules have nothing.</p>
<p>As a result, you have this kind of non-equilibrium</p>
<p>immediately creates lasers.</p>
<p>So this is one of the reasons why lasers,</p>
<p>all first lasers, they were created in plasma.</p>
<p>Even now, the most energetic, like CO2 laser,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s plasma lasers.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s also plasma lasers.</p>
<p>So plasma, it&rsquo;s very accelerated application,</p>
<p>but physics is here.</p>
<p>I can explain it a little bit longer how it works,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s very similar to what is going on with people.</p>
<p>If you already have money,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s easier for you to attract new money.</p>
<p>If you are actually poor, sooner or later,</p>
<p>you will lose your money in the favor of rich people.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure how well that analogy works,</p>
<p>but probably, but you&rsquo;re saying that there&rsquo;s some</p>
<p>fascinating, complicated instability</p>
<p>about that whole richer capitalism.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting instability.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s instability, not space instability.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s energy instability.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a-</p>
<p>Yeah, you said capitalism, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Capitalism at the molecular level.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a capitalism, it&rsquo;s like a wild capitalism,</p>
<p>where just everything works against middle class.</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s the Bernie Sanders in this physics analogy?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just kidding.</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s the socialist?</p>
<p>Okay, let&rsquo;s not take this analogy too far.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s interesting that you know that plasma</p>
<p>works against Bernie Sanders.</p>
<p>So nature, nature-</p>
<p>Yeah, nature is a-</p>
<p>More Republican.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a more Republican.</p>
<p>Nature is Republican.</p>
<p>Well-</p>
<p>No, not nature.</p>
<p>I mean, plasma, it&rsquo;s only non-equilibrium plasma.</p>
<p>Non-equilibrium plasma.</p>
<p>Equilibrium plasma, everything is very much</p>
<p>Bernie Sanders.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very much honest distribution.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, non-equilibrium plasma is</p>
<p>live a short life and die quickly.</p>
<p>So-</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So if you want a long, peaceful existence,</p>
<p>you want to go-</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one of the reasons why-</p>
<p>With Bernie Sanders.</p>
<p>In physics.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s very interesting that for this reason,</p>
<p>non-equilibrium plasma, cold plasma,</p>
<p>is able to produce way more miracles.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s-</p>
<p>Miracles meaning very interesting structures, patterns.</p>
<p>Structures, patterns, treatment.</p>
<p>You cannot use hot plasma to make electronic device.</p>
<p>Well, you can do it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just one example.</p>
<p>Another example is like recently, I came yesterday.</p>
<p>Well, yeah, yesterday from Japan.</p>
<p>So we presented ionization of liquids, not gases.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a lot of interesting new stuff.</p>
<p>Oh, liquids, very interesting.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve mentioned physics and chemistry.</p>
<p>What is plasma physics?</p>
<p>What is plasma chemistry?</p>
<p>In terms of application, in terms of theory,</p>
<p>what are the different lenses of physics and chemistry</p>
<p>that you use to explore plasma?</p>
<p>And how do they differ?</p>
<p>You have books on each.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>The simplest, I think that it was Feynman who was asked,</p>
<p>what is physics?</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s him.</p>
<p>And after some thinking, he said,</p>
<p>well, that&rsquo;s what physicists do.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a good point.</p>
<p>So actually&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a nice way to say that&rsquo;s a stupid question.</p>
<p>But give the question more of a chance.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the difference?</p>
<p>Between plasma physics and plasma chemistry.</p>
<p>And even physics and chemistry more broadly.</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s the more easier distinction to draw.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I can compare with languages.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the difference between English language and Chinese language?</p>
<p>In one case, you have how many?</p>
<p>I forgot, 23 or whatever characters.</p>
<p>How many?</p>
<p>Yeah, five, six?</p>
<p>Okay, something like that.</p>
<p>Something 20s, yeah.</p>
<p>And in Japanese, oh, in Chinese, you have 10,000, 40,000 characters.</p>
<p>So Chinese, it&rsquo;s chemistry.</p>
<p>English, it&rsquo;s physics.</p>
<p>Physics has a small number of rules and laws of nature and operates with that.</p>
<p>So understanding, let&rsquo;s say, how to ionize gas, it&rsquo;s physics.</p>
<p>Understanding how to create plasma in liquid, it&rsquo;s physics.</p>
<p>Understanding how to make a device, how to make a light source, plasma light source,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s physics.</p>
<p>Now, when we are coming to Chinese, I mean, to this chemistry, it means that there is</p>
<p>a million different&hellip;</p>
<p>Tables, not rules, tables.</p>
<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s tables instead of rules.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s going on, you just look at that and say, oh my gosh, this plasma,</p>
<p>especially non-equilibrium plasma, creates thousands of species.</p>
<p>And we have to understand what kind of species.</p>
<p>And sometimes you need this species, but you don&rsquo;t need this species.</p>
<p>So how to have more of that and how to have less of these, and there is no rules.</p>
<p>Well, there are some rules, but about as much as in creating Chinese characters.</p>
<p>So a lot of it is, a lot of the knowledge in plasma chemistry is discovered</p>
<p>through experimentation?</p>
<p>Yeah, and I would say chemistry is more art.</p>
<p>Physics, it&rsquo;s a little bit more science, like linguistics, you know, English language,</p>
<p>possible.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also a lot of challenges, but it&rsquo;s simple.</p>
<p>Well, talking about simple and complicated, going from physics to chemistry, let&rsquo;s go</p>
<p>to biology.</p>
<p>One of the exciting fields that you&rsquo;re one of the founders of is plasma medicine.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What is plasma medicine?</p>
<p>Okay, cold plasma, cold plasma, creates a lot of species, interesting species,</p>
<p>unexpected species.</p>
<p>You remember this capitalism in molecular life, you can a little bit change parameters</p>
<p>and it can be, wow, look, I start generating this strange substance, et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p>So plasma is very sensitive, it&rsquo;s like a human body.</p>
<p>Plasma generates very interesting active species.</p>
<p>Actually, to be honest, almost exactly the same.</p>
<p>So Professor David Graves, he keeps saying that he was impressed when he looked, you</p>
<p>know, books of medical biology books and he said like a species, active species inside</p>
<p>of human body and in cold plasma, they&rsquo;re the same.</p>
<p>So plasma creates this very interesting stuff and it was clear for people from the beginning,</p>
<p>like already for more than 100 years, that if you put plasma in contact with human body,</p>
<p>you can treat some diseases, you can do a lot of stuff.</p>
<p>The problem was that if plasma is energetic and you put this energetic plasma in contact</p>
<p>with human body, you&rsquo;ll kill the person.</p>
<p>So actually, the whole point, the whole interesting point of plasma medicine, so plasma medicine</p>
<p>came from physicists, actually, where it become possible to make uniform, not damaging,</p>
<p>very energetic plasmas.</p>
<p>Example, at atmospheric pressure.</p>
<p>Example, we have atmospheric pressure around atmosphere and there is a lightning.</p>
<p>Lightning is hot and very energetic and very damaging.</p>
<p>Plasma sources, plasma discharges like lightning, it&rsquo;s impossible to use to treat human body,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll just&hellip;</p>
<p>You destroy a lot of body.</p>
<p>You destroy it, right, you&rsquo;ll kill the person.</p>
<p>The tissue, yeah.</p>
<p>Now, what happened like 16 years ago, it was the first time when physicists learned how</p>
<p>to make lightning not like concentrated in a tiny channel, but to be diffused and just</p>
<p>around the big, big, big, big area.</p>
<p>To make it something like Aurora Borealis from lightning.</p>
<p>And it was actually in 1990s a lot of efforts.</p>
<p>It was a French approach, they just, et cetera.</p>
<p>But finally, we won because it was like an out-of-the-box solution to make extremely</p>
<p>short electric pulses.</p>
<p>Short spatially or temporarily, in time?</p>
<p>Time, in time.</p>
<p>So, let&rsquo;s say, because we have, when we have lightning between clouds and ground,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like a continuous voltage.</p>
<p>But if we apply this voltage between skies and ground, let&rsquo;s say, a couple of nanoseconds,</p>
<p>there is no time to create the lightning channel.</p>
<p>Just simply no time.</p>
<p>So, what is going on?</p>
<p>You start creating something like Aurora Borealis, so you have it glowing everywhere.</p>
<p>Because there is no time to create the channel.</p>
<p>So, you make this pulse, and then you stop.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And then you repeat this pulse again, and you stop.</p>
<p>And you repeat this pulse again.</p>
<p>So, through this nanosecond pulsing, it becomes possible to create uniform plasma.</p>
<p>And if plasma is uniform, it&rsquo;s not damaging.</p>
<p>Aurora Borealis, you will not kill anybody.</p>
<p>With lightning, you will.</p>
<p>So, that allows you, not damaging, to now start allowing plasma to interact with the</p>
<p>human body somehow.</p>
<p>So, treating tissues, for example.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Why is that interesting?</p>
<p>Yeah, what kind of applications are we talking about?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Today, the biggest application is related to treatment of chronic wounds, like ulcers,</p>
<p>especially diabetic ulcers.</p>
<p>Also, recently, treatment of cancers.</p>
<p>Because plasma sources are permitted to be used during surgery.</p>
<p>So, when a surgeon is making a surgery, he removes cancer, but some margins are not treated.</p>
<p>So, they start using this plasma just to remove tissue, bad tissue, without damage.</p>
<p>Because instead of a scalpel, it&rsquo;s like a jet, a small jet.</p>
<p>But for wounds, it&rsquo;s a very effective generation of, it&rsquo;s a stimulation of angiogenesis.</p>
<p>So, just growing of blood vessels.</p>
<p>So, that&rsquo;s, I would say, two most successful applications today.</p>
<p>What plasma-related Nobel Prizes do you think will be given in the next 50 years?</p>
<p>So, if you look at the big ideas in plasma, what do you think is there to be discovered,</p>
<p>understood, or may have already been understood and will be recognized for it?</p>
<p>Okay, closer to our field, at least where we are playing.</p>
<p>Our field is plasma?</p>
<p>I would say, cold plasma for medical, biological applications.</p>
<p>I would say, if there is a significant, actually, accepted by FDA, et cetera,</p>
<p>success in treatment of cancer, there is a big chance to get Nobel Prize.</p>
<p>What discipline would you get?</p>
<p>It will be medicine.</p>
<p>In medicine, that&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>That is this.</p>
<p>Another example, which I like a lot, personally, it is this plasma,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s ionization of liquids without bubbles.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a chance also to get Nobel Prize for that,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s, first of all, it&rsquo;s a fascinating physics.</p>
<p>Ionization of liquids without bubbles, what&rsquo;s the nature of the bubbles, the form?</p>
<p>If you take liquid and put two electrodes in the liquid,</p>
<p>to ionize liquid, you need a huge electric field.</p>
<p>At least that&rsquo;s what most of the people, they used to think,</p>
<p>because mean free pass is small.</p>
<p>So electrons, they have to be accelerated to have this huge energy.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s either electric field is huge, or there is enough distance, just to accelerate.</p>
<p>Now, if I have liquid, that&rsquo;s not much place to go.</p>
<p>So you have to have about a thousand times greater electric field.</p>
<p>Or you have to create some voids.</p>
<p>If you create voids inside of liquid, that&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>Now, that&rsquo;s what people, they used to believe.</p>
<p>But maybe about five, seven years ago, people, they understood that even when they have</p>
<p>very high electric field, but not a huge, they start having ionization of liquids.</p>
<p>So just the same as plasma in fluorescent lamps, but you have the same thing in liquid.</p>
<p>And first of all, it&rsquo;s very interesting physics.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a longer story to explain.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very interesting physics, but also it&rsquo;s very interesting application,</p>
<p>because you have possibility to have cold plasma inside of liquid.</p>
<p>So you can synthesize new materials.</p>
<p>You can do something.</p>
<p>So that was a reason, like I came a couple of, yesterday, making this presentation of</p>
<p>these discharges and creation of this, in this discharge, creation of polymeric nitrogen.</p>
<p>Because people, they don&rsquo;t have nitrogen polymers today.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s in cold plasma, it was synthesized.</p>
<p>So it is very interesting from fundamental point of view of synthetic chemistry,</p>
<p>but nobody were able to make like this kind of change from nitrogen.</p>
<p>So that was created, which is very interesting.</p>
<p>Now this material, it&rsquo;s normal conditions, is converted back to regular nitrogen,</p>
<p>releasing huge energy, way more than any explosive materials.</p>
<p>So, it&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>So those are two interesting ideas close to your heart.</p>
<p>What about the sun?</p>
<p>What about hot thermal plasma?</p>
<p>Do you think there&rsquo;s interesting open problems there that will help us understand the universe</p>
<p>or something like that?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>
<p>Today, there is no, I think for thermal plasma, there is very low chances for Nobel Prize</p>
<p>kind of results.</p>
<p>However, there is a so-called fusion plasmas.</p>
<p>So plasmas, because this thermal plasma, which we discussed, it&rsquo;s thermal engineering plasmas.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s plasmas like melting, welding, these kind of applications, coatings, and surface</p>
<p>of the sun, surface of the sun.</p>
<p>But if you go to higher temperatures, you have fusion, nuclear fusion.</p>
<p>But if in normal plasma, thermal plasma temperature is about 10,000 Kelvin, 10,000, for fusion,</p>
<p>you have to have 100 million.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s more.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>So inside the sun is like 100 million.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s deeply inside.</p>
<p>And the physics there is interesting?</p>
<p>Physics is extremely interesting because it&rsquo;s a lot of questions with stability.</p>
<p>And this plasma, this kind of temperature will behave very different.</p>
<p>So it is, I would say, superfluidic material.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>Do you think there&rsquo;s possible breakthroughs in terms of using fusion as an energy source</p>
<p>or somehow, you know, that kind of, okay, crazy ideas, but out there ideas.</p>
<p>But on this podcast, I talk to people about aliens and traveling across the universe.</p>
<p>So if you want to travel across the universe, you&rsquo;re going to have to&hellip;</p>
<p>My feeling is that, my feeling is that like a fusion plasma in its traditional way,</p>
<p>which was started by Sakharov in 1953, almost no chances.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, they have it.</p>
<p>They have it already.</p>
<p>But the system is so complicated.</p>
<p>This tokamaks, this big ether, big tokamak is so complicated, so difficult.</p>
<p>That personally, it&rsquo;s difficult for me to believe that it will be like a real</p>
<p>energy generating plant.</p>
<p>So this is being able to control fusion in order to leverage it for energy.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I just say try already for how many years?</p>
<p>Cold fusion.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an interesting point.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m trying to say, that I&rsquo;m almost sure that at some point, hopefully soon,</p>
<p>it will be a young, well, not so much young, but usually young,</p>
<p>out-of-the-box thinking person who will say, guys, take a look, I did it.</p>
<p>Something like cold fusion.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s been a lot of guys and girls like that who are called crazy,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;ve been talking about cold fusion for decades.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So you think, you hope that there is a breakthrough idea that might lead?</p>
<p>Yes, yes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m almost sure about that.</p>
<p>And I can explain you simple physics, if it will take 40 seconds, 30 seconds.</p>
<p>It won&rsquo;t take longer, but okay.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m timing.</p>
<p>Take a look, take a look.</p>
<p>What is fusion?</p>
<p>You take deuterium, tritium or deuterium, deuterium.</p>
<p>You bring them together and they fuse and they release energy.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it, right?</p>
<p>The problem is that this is iron, this is iron.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re positively charged and we have to bring them extremely close.</p>
<p>And energy required for that is 100 million degrees.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what they try to do now.</p>
<p>Now take a look.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>We have to bring them so much close.</p>
<p>We can bring them a little bit and it will be tunneling.</p>
<p>So they will start reacting.</p>
<p>It requires more time.</p>
<p>Yes, but that&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>But to do that, you have to have way smaller sizes.</p>
<p>You have to have dense matter, maybe 30, 40, 50 times denser than what we have now.</p>
<p>How to do that?</p>
<p>You have to replace electron by something very similar to electron, but heavier.</p>
<p>Muons.</p>
<p>If you do that, immediately substance becomes smaller and you start having cold normal fusion.</p>
<p>But like a production and reproduction of this material, it&rsquo;s kind of complicated.</p>
<p>People there try.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m trying to say is that somebody will come up with an interesting,</p>
<p>out-of-the-box solution.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I believe.</p>
<p>Well, you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>A lot of people there are a little bit, how to say, not professional.</p>
<p>They just say, oh, look, I did it.</p>
<p>But between these people or between serious scientists, thinking out of the box, something</p>
<p>will happen.</p>
<p>Tokamaks, yes, they work, but they&rsquo;re too much complicated.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very difficult to keep 100 million degrees for reasonably long time.</p>
<p>Just very difficult.</p>
<p>Beautiful.</p>
<p>But whatever will do that, Nobel Prize without any question.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Okay, we talked about coming to, here&rsquo;s to you, you&rsquo;re doing good, three hours in.</p>
<p>We talked about the journey to America a little bit.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a step back.</p>
<p>It seems like an unlikely journey that has to do with a bunch of different factors, ideas,</p>
<p>hopes and dreams and goals and plans.</p>
<p>Why did we move to America as a family?</p>
<p>Can you tell the story there narrowly and broadly as our big family?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a lot of details, a lot of interesting stuff which happened at the same time together.</p>
<p>First of all, I was already in France most of the time, which made the situation easier</p>
<p>to go to America.</p>
<p>But absolutely significant role was played by Kaplan&rsquo;s family.</p>
<p>What was the Kaplan&rsquo;s family?</p>
<p>Yeah, it is&hellip;</p>
<p>Our last name is Freedman.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Picking attention.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s Kaplan?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the name of your grandmother, yours?</p>
<p>My grandmother?</p>
<p>My great-grandmother.</p>
<p>Your great-grandmother, right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So her name was Kapilevich and when her family came in America, they changed name to Kaplan&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>And it was forbidden to contact family during Stalin period.</p>
<p>To reach outside the country, the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s this big family, well, at that time not big,</p>
<p>but now big Kaplan family that came to the United States.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>And my father, your grandfather, had this interesting picture and without much hopes</p>
<p>he wrote a letter without speaking English.</p>
<p>And you saw this letter where it is said like a Jew newspaper, that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>And the word Jew was G&hellip;</p>
<p>Spelled with a G.</p>
<p>G-E-W.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Newspaper, Cincinnati, that&rsquo;s it, America.</p>
<p>And&hellip;</p>
<p>Well, he got to his destination.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s like a miracle that the letter came to destination.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting because the newspaper published the letter.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of a miracle.</p>
<p>And that, yeah, it&rsquo;s a miracle.</p>
<p>So that started&hellip;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a miracle.</p>
<p>That gave a catalyst.</p>
<p>That was a catalyst.</p>
<p>Yeah, it was a catalyst for connection.</p>
<p>And just as a result, you know, we met and it was a catalyst for me to accept the position</p>
<p>already from France, position of a full professor in University of Illinois.</p>
<p>And at Chicago, and that&rsquo;s actually how we moved to Chicago.</p>
<p>So did you ever think that you would come to America?</p>
<p>Honestly, no.</p>
<p>Even with my good friends, we were usually talking and my plans, when I understand that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s better for a scientist to go like outside of Soviet Union&hellip;</p>
<p>Europe, then you would go to France.</p>
<p>And my choice was clearly France.</p>
<p>And we usually say that&hellip;</p>
<p>I spoke with Boris Potapkin that I will go to France.</p>
<p>I said, well, and I want to go to South America.</p>
<p>Well, but actually happened all the way opposite, so&hellip;</p>
<p>Yes, okay.</p>
<p>I spoke way better French language.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I started taking French.</p>
<p>There was an alternate reality where we moved to France and I&rsquo;m French and you&rsquo;re French.</p>
<p>And chances for that were very high.</p>
<p>50-50 kind of thing.</p>
<p>I mean, I remember there being is pretty certain that we&rsquo;re going to France.</p>
<p>Yeah, it was more than 50% chance.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Because we have already, I mean, it was very, very high chances.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You remember the picture I show you over there when we are with French people,</p>
<p>with Albin Chernyakhovsky, if you remember.</p>
<p>I just forever remember like Albin Chernyakhovsky and he loves you.</p>
<p>He used to love&hellip;</p>
<p>Oh, he&rsquo;s alive.</p>
<p>But the pianist, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, and he plays very nice piano.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very, very nice people and&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a different world of scientists.</p>
<p>It is very different.</p>
<p>Perhaps more pure in their pursuit of science,</p>
<p>more support for the kind of labs and the spirit of the scientific process.</p>
<p>America&rsquo;s academic research system is a little bit more capitalistic, I guess.</p>
<p>American professor spends about 50% of time looking for funding.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re a little bit more independent,</p>
<p>meaning their own little startup more.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very difficult to do an institute and so on.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, I don&rsquo;t know how I forgot to mention,</p>
<p>but the institute, you&rsquo;ve headed the Drexel, the Nihilm Plasma Institute for a long time.</p>
<p>From 2002.</p>
<p>From 2002.</p>
<p>What was that journey like of all the many brilliant people</p>
<p>that have worked there through the years?</p>
<p>All the different ideas.</p>
<p>Having an institute in America is an interesting thing in itself.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s that journey been like?</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>It was very exciting and very challenging.</p>
<p>And I would say that I worked very hard,</p>
<p>but I would say I was very much lucky that I was able to bring</p>
<p>with me a nice group of people.</p>
<p>It was Nestor, Gutzal, Porzhnev, and more recently Rabinovich,</p>
<p>and Daniel Dobrynin a lot now, and others.</p>
<p>So it was a lot of people, and they were good.</p>
<p>And it was a very nice feeling of, how to say, camaraderie.</p>
<p>Yeah, including Greg, who made a huge contribution to that, enormous.</p>
<p>So it is like a family.</p>
<p>Greg is my brother.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve been on the outside of that, sort of looking in,</p>
<p>so I know a lot of these people.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re almost like a part of family.</p>
<p>I know they&rsquo;re part of our story in America, really.</p>
<p>And we have Ansem, do you remember, of Nihilm Plasma Institute?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Go ahead, don&rsquo;t be shy.</p>
<p>No, no fear, no fear.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t be shy, go ahead.</p>
<p>NPI.</p>
<p>NPI, did you write that?</p>
<p>Yeah, I wrote that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s proving that since eighth grade, your poetry has been going downhill.</p>
<p>And I mean, we talk about that a lot,</p>
<p>that writing poetry in English is actually much more difficult.</p>
<p>And hence why it&rsquo;s not as popular.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s now more popular, I guess, in music, through hip hop, through rap.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the popular kind of poetic writing is in America.</p>
<p>Very different.</p>
<p>By the way, in France, it is way closer to Russian.</p>
<p>The French language allows for poetry.</p>
<p>Yeah, French language allows for this song-oriented poetry.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What would you say is the difference between the Soviet Union and America?</p>
<p>That kind of, and maybe to ask it another way,</p>
<p>what do you miss about the Soviet Union, about Russia, about Ukraine?</p>
<p>You see that while me and other people which came in our generation,</p>
<p>which came from Russia, Ukraine, Soviet Union,</p>
<p>we just, we were not happy, absolutely not happy with the political system over there.</p>
<p>But I would say without any exception, we are all, I would say,</p>
<p>deeply in love with Russian culture, which is absolutely unique and absolutely beautiful.</p>
<p>And my feeling that while I like American culture also,</p>
<p>but Russian is way closer to my heart, and I think it&rsquo;s way richer.</p>
<p>The same thing is approach to science, which in Russia was very,</p>
<p>first of all, I like it because I was younger, which is always nice to be young.</p>
<p>But, you know, this kind of feeling of science is more important than everything else.</p>
<p>And being a professor, it is the most prestigious profession.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s kind of interesting culture.</p>
<p>But the political system was not good, and now it&rsquo;s also challenging.</p>
<p>What do you think about Putin?</p>
<p>Putin, sorry to interrupt, Putin came to power after we left.</p>
<p>Yeah, 2000, year 2000.</p>
<p>Exactly, you remember this moment when we were in Miami Beach?</p>
<p>New Year&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>New Year, it was exactly the day when Putin became a president.</p>
<p>Because absolutely unexpectedly, one day before that,</p>
<p>it was like a New Year greeting from a president at that time, Boris Yeltsin.</p>
<p>And he said, happy holidays, happy New Year, guys.</p>
<p>And you know what?</p>
<p>I decided to step down.</p>
<p>Oops.</p>
<p>And just, I want another person to lead the country during transition period,</p>
<p>and then we have elections.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the day.</p>
<p>So we talk, and I, in different ways, also love certain parts of Russia.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re still a part of me, even though it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t spend there more than 13 years or whatever.</p>
<p>But Putin represents modern Russia.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why I ask, if, you know, we&rsquo;re Americans now, really.</p>
<p>But what do you think about this man who&rsquo;s carrying,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s defining the 21st century Russia?</p>
<p>I would say there is two phrases, two sayings, which come into my mind.</p>
<p>You see, you gave me 10 seconds to think, which is important.</p>
<p>Um, there is a saying, the ends justifies the means.</p>
<p>You know who said that?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a, there is a book here.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a, it&rsquo;s a Machiavelli.</p>
<p>Oh, this is, by the way, his sculpture, small one.</p>
<p>Yeah, the, the, the, the, the head, the.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Bust rate.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a Machiavelli.</p>
<p>In the book Prince, he said that the ends justifies the means.</p>
<p>Another phrase, it&rsquo;s another nice guy.</p>
<p>Maximilian Robespierre.</p>
<p>He used to say, you cannot make an omelet without breaking eggs.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s Robespierre.</p>
<p>And these two phrases, actually, they describe, for me, at least, Putin.</p>
<p>You know that his way of thinking is, it was a huge geocatastrophe.</p>
<p>Because think for a second, a huge Soviet Union, where Russians, they were everywhere.</p>
<p>Russian people, Russian, Russian.</p>
<p>And in, during a short period of time, booms.</p>
<p>It is a 15 independent countries.</p>
<p>What the hell?</p>
<p>And, and like significant, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I would say almost half, okay, less than half, but very significant number of Russians.</p>
<p>They become like people living in other countries, not very much friendly to Russia.</p>
<p>So he put all his efforts to change it, to, to, to make it easier and better.</p>
<p>And this is the ends, which justifies means.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s breaking a lot of eggs.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s making a lot of not good steps, but for the good purpose.</p>
<p>Now, just what I keep thinking, that Russian empire, it is not first empire to disappear.</p>
<p>Now, take a look what happened to other empires.</p>
<p>French empire.</p>
<p>Oh my gosh.</p>
<p>They had enormously problems, very similar to Putin.</p>
<p>And you know, who was there Putin?</p>
<p>It was de Gaulle.</p>
<p>Because in late 1950s, it was an enormous war in Algeria and a whole group of Maghreb countries.</p>
<p>And you know what happened?</p>
<p>They just even stopped the republic and they create absolutely new constitution.</p>
<p>And it was actually absolute disaster in late 1950s, early 1960s.</p>
<p>But they actually went out faster than Russia.</p>
<p>Well, why?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a different story.</p>
<p>Now, take a look another huge, the biggest empire in the world, it&rsquo;s a British.</p>
<p>They lost their empire and a huge number of British people, they just stay somewhere.</p>
<p>The same thing like Soviet Union.</p>
<p>But interesting enough, they made like these other countries, which get rid of British</p>
<p>empire, but they were still in love with the queen.</p>
<p>They become part of this commonwealth and it was relatively smooth.</p>
<p>So British, they did excellent job.</p>
<p>French, like always, you know.</p>
<p>But Russia so far doing not good.</p>
<p>So they are just, they try to help, they try to make this kind of, but they break a lot</p>
<p>of eggs.</p>
<p>Should I interview Putin on this podcast?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a very interesting personality.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s very smart.</p>
<p>And try.</p>
<p>But sure, but what you&rsquo;re going to talk about?</p>
<p>Because-</p>
<p>Power, future of Russia.</p>
<p>Future of Russia is great and it&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>No, no, no, not in those kinds of questions, but in the kind of omelet and eggs way.</p>
<p>And in the space of technology, sort of innovation of science, of becoming a superpower again,</p>
<p>which is where you have to, you know, the space race.</p>
<p>He will like this kind of discussion because what I know about him, by the way, he supported</p>
<p>plasma medicine, believe me or not.</p>
<p>Plasma medicine?</p>
<p>Yes, because when he defined like three or whatever, four major directions of development</p>
<p>of science, he mentioned both artificial intelligence and plasma medicine.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay, interesting.</p>
<p>He really thinks that the ends justifies the means.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s not afraid to make any kind of decision, but to make countries stronger.</p>
<p>And he did actually, he did very good job from the point of view of, like, you know,</p>
<p>all other republics, they were saying that all our problems is because of Russia.</p>
<p>But what Russia can say that all these problems because of&hellip;</p>
<p>Yeah, he took responsibility, but with power, authoritarians, power is very useful, but</p>
<p>it can also cloud your judgment.</p>
<p>You can slowly become a lesser man that you could have otherwise been without being checked.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a complicated, interesting story.</p>
<p>So you can compare him with Maximilian Robespierre.</p>
<p>So without a microphone between us, we often talk about artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>You have a lot of opinions.</p>
<p>Like you said, you always think you&rsquo;re right, and you&rsquo;re right, you know, barely half of</p>
<p>the time.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m right absolutely always with exception of cases when I&rsquo;m wrong.</p>
<p>When I&rsquo;m wrong, which never happens.</p>
<p>It hasn&rsquo;t been observed.</p>
<p>Okay, so let me get your profound, deep opinions about artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>Do you think we&rsquo;ll ever build systems that are as intelligent or more intelligent than</p>
<p>human beings in the same kind of way that we think humans are intelligent?</p>
<p>You know, the most important, it&rsquo;s the last remark which you made.</p>
<p>I strongly believe in artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>I believe that it will be a lot of development in the direction of like a human, similarity</p>
<p>to human, but I very much doubt about artificial consciousness.</p>
<p>This kind of stuff, from my point of view, it&rsquo;s very questionable, so I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>What is consciousness to you?</p>
<p>Consciousness, it&rsquo;s way more, it&rsquo;s a wider stuff, it&rsquo;s like a love, it&rsquo;s a complex of</p>
<p>feelings.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a complex of feelings, like intelligence, it&rsquo;s smartness, it&rsquo;s knowledge, it&rsquo;s a possibility</p>
<p>to operate with knowledge.</p>
<p>Consciousness, it&rsquo;s knowledge, but way much together with feelings.</p>
<p>Way much together with feelings.</p>
<p>Do you think science will ever be able to understand consciousness?</p>
<p>Yeah, I believe.</p>
<p>I believe that sooner or later, at least in this direction, will be big breakthroughs.</p>
<p>So do you think we&rsquo;ll be able to put consciousness inside a Roomba, inside a phone, inside a</p>
<p>camera, devices?</p>
<p>Consciousness.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>You know, like a Jewish answer to most of the questions, I mean, we don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Just we don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s very difficult to predict what will happen with science in 300 years.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like to ask 300 years ago, in what, in 1700, come on, it&rsquo;s way before Napoleon.</p>
<p>Yeah, the internet.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the last years of Louis XIV, whatever, Ludovic XIV, and you ask them about cell phones.</p>
<p>If you ask Louis XIV, if you ask him a question, what he thinks about cell phones, he will</p>
<p>say, je suis roi soleil, I am a sun king.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>No, you&rsquo;re simplifying, because perhaps, perhaps, perhaps, but because he doesn&rsquo;t know the word</p>
<p>cell phone, but if I asked him about artificial intelligence and explained it correctly, he</p>
<p>would actually have an opinion already.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve had opinions about these kinds of things.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>So can man, this is a fundamental philosophical question, can human beings create artificial</p>
<p>versions of themselves with Frankenstein?</p>
<p>I mean, people have been thinking, when you build up statues, it&rsquo;s a, and people have</p>
<p>been, maybe not Jews, but people have been confidently providing answers.</p>
<p>Okay, what I can tell you, my feeling, yes, artificial person will be created.</p>
<p>The question is, how close it will be, this synthetic person will be with respect to reality.</p>
<p>Is it good or bad?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just different, but it is doable.</p>
<p>So we have this disagreement a lot, and you think that, so do you think such a system</p>
<p>needs to have a body?</p>
<p>And our disagreement is often about the senses.</p>
<p>You say to have a full, rich experience of consciousness, you need smell, touch, and</p>
<p>I say you can do just words.</p>
<p>Words and image.</p>
<p>No, even just words, but yes, image is helpful.</p>
<p>But words, even just, yeah, words, voice.</p>
<p>Okay, you know, like, don&rsquo;t forget, I lived many years in France, so for me, smell, like</p>
<p>a aromaniac, I mean, smell is very much often more important than taste.</p>
<p>But image can be even less important.</p>
<p>So just taste and smell.</p>
<p>So what I&rsquo;m trying to say that, I mean, but that&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Yeah, wait, wait, if I give you an option, I had to kill all your senses except one,</p>
<p>which one would you like to stay with?</p>
<p>I would not, you know, that&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not a good question.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a question, if you have a choice to kill your father or mother, what you would</p>
<p>do?</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>Father.</p>
<p>Well, what I&rsquo;m trying to say that it&rsquo;s, my feeling, it&rsquo;s more holistic that people,</p>
<p>they can lose one of feelings, it&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>But.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>I mean, yeah, that&rsquo;s not a useful question, but you think.</p>
<p>Consciousness, it&rsquo;s actually, it&rsquo;s a bouquet, including, like you said.</p>
<p>Consciousness is a bouquet, I like it.</p>
<p>But you think a system should have a sense of smell, a sense of touch.</p>
<p>And my feeling is that it&rsquo;s not so difficult to do.</p>
<p>Yes, so this is where we have disagreements and debates on software versus hardware.</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;re much more comfortable with hardware and taste and smell.</p>
<p>These are kinds of things that, it&rsquo;s almost like a sensor.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a chemistry problem.</p>
<p>But for me, actually, I am from harmony.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying this is hardware, this is software.</p>
<p>I would say that it&rsquo;s not a bouquet in this case, it&rsquo;s a harmony.</p>
<p>Harmony, yeah.</p>
<p>No, I guess I come from a world that&rsquo;s a very kind of AI world and computer science world,</p>
<p>where you think that most of the problems in the world can be converted into a 99%</p>
<p>software problem.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the dream, because it&rsquo;s easier then.</p>
<p>But you know, it was a Russian comedian, absolutely beautiful, Zhvonetsky,</p>
<p>maybe you remember him, maybe not.</p>
<p>He used to say in Russian,</p>
<p>–î–∞–≤–∞–π—Ç–µ —Å–ø–æ—Ä–∏—Ç—å –æ –≤–∫—É—Å–µ —É—Å—Ç—Ä–∏—Ü, –µ—Å–ª–∏ –±—ã —Ö–æ—Ç—è –±—ã –∫—Ç–æ-–Ω–∏–±—É–¥—å –∏–∑ –Ω–∞—Å –∏—Ö –ø—Ä–æ–±–æ–≤–∞–ª.</p>
<p>What does it mean?</p>
<p>Well, can you translate it into English?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>No, don&rsquo;t even try.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fine, it&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>But what I&rsquo;m trying to say, this is the point, is, is it possible to describe with words</p>
<p>tastes of oysters if you never ever tried them?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a very important moment.</p>
<p>Sometimes this big data and artificial intelligence, they say,</p>
<p>Okay, we don&rsquo;t need smell.</p>
<p>We can describe it.</p>
<p>What does it mean, describe the smell?</p>
<p>It means that they can collect data about like a smell of cheese and put it in like</p>
<p>a huge database.</p>
<p>And based on that, to help you to choose what is the best taste without smelling.</p>
<p>So in this case, I have to recommend to this computer or to this computer scientist</p>
<p>to think about Zvonetsky and this argument about taste of oysters</p>
<p>without trying them at least once in their life.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I think that taste and smell should be also important.</p>
<p>Yeah, I disagree because I think it is.</p>
<p>So I agree that it&rsquo;s very important, but I believe our mind and artificial minds will</p>
<p>be able to fill in the gaps.</p>
<p>So without being able to smell, you start without ever having tasted or smelled oysters,</p>
<p>you can start imagining smell and taste.</p>
<p>It won&rsquo;t be connected to reality at all, but you&rsquo;ll construct a world that&rsquo;s consistent.</p>
<p>So I would say in this case, it&rsquo;s not artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s synthetic intelligence.</p>
<p>And I prefer artificial because in the word artificial, you have the word art.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>So and synthetic means like you synthesize something.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s no, there&rsquo;s no, it&rsquo;s lacking of the human experience.</p>
<p>And artificial has that art.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Well, you might be right because the only intelligence system we have now has smell.</p>
<p>Oh, really?</p>
<p>Ah, us.</p>
<p>Us, humans.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Very good.</p>
<p>I like it.</p>
<p>Do you think about mortality, your own mortality?</p>
<p>Yes, because there&rsquo;s three elements to that.</p>
<p>One, like I&rsquo;m a normal person, and I think about that especially in relation with parents.</p>
<p>When you lost your dad?</p>
<p>Yes, and mom also.</p>
<p>So, you know, you cannot, that&rsquo;s something which happened to everybody at some point</p>
<p>when you lose your father and mother, you understand that now it&rsquo;s you.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re next.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, well, that&rsquo;s human.</p>
<p>The second element what I think about is religion.</p>
<p>Because at least for me, but for many people also, like going to beliefs of your parents,</p>
<p>grandparents, et cetera, helps.</p>
<p>Helps, and you start to understand.</p>
<p>The older you are, the closer you are to this moment, the more you just feel it.</p>
<p>So, role of the religion is huge.</p>
<p>And number three, I&rsquo;m a scientist.</p>
<p>And a couple of weeks ago, we had a long discussion on the conference about</p>
<p>immortality.</p>
<p>It was on this cosmetic meeting, because I mentioned to you that with this LVMH,</p>
<p>like Louis Vuitton or whatever, and Hennessey.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the important one.</p>
<p>We have been talking about like a possibility to change direction of aging.</p>
<p>And this is one of challenges which actually in the beginning of plasma medicine we start</p>
<p>trying to do.</p>
<p>And it was like a kind of serious experiment trying to using plasma to</p>
<p>determine aging process.</p>
<p>I can explain you a little bit more details, but it&rsquo;s a longer story.</p>
<p>But as a result of these experiments, unfortunately, we show that in all 100% of</p>
<p>like experiments we did, we actually accelerated aging.</p>
<p>Not, but maybe we have to.</p>
<p>But ideas you might be able to, from a scientific perspective, control it.</p>
<p>There is a solution.</p>
<p>Because you know that mortality, it&rsquo;s just God or nature put it in us, this mortality.</p>
<p>In which way we have stem cells, and they just providing differentiation,</p>
<p>which is like a renovation of us.</p>
<p>When there is a tiny, small kid, he change his nose, I don&rsquo;t know, each couple of days.</p>
<p>So just it&rsquo;s always like a renovation of the tissue.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s death and birth, death and birth.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>It is not like a nose is like growing.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s just let&rsquo;s say each time I have a new one.</p>
<p>Now, when in your age, like I&rsquo;m simplifying, it happened less often.</p>
<p>Maybe once in, I don&rsquo;t know, five, 10 years.</p>
<p>But for me, unfortunately, I will stay with this nose forever.</p>
<p>Now, so the only thing we have to do, actually, is just to&hellip;</p>
<p>And these cells, stem cells, they&rsquo;re still there.</p>
<p>But their efficiency is, for some not very much known reason, going down, down, down, down, down, down.</p>
<p>So what do we have to do?</p>
<p>We have to actually help these stem cells, stimulate them just to become again more active.</p>
<p>And if we do that, and plasma medicine tried,</p>
<p>then just, you know, instead of getting older and older, we&rsquo;ll go back younger and younger.</p>
<p>Is it possible?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s against the law of nature, no?</p>
<p>So this is a third way to think about that.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s a real challenge.</p>
<p>Interesting that it was a discussion on this subject with Louis Vuitton.</p>
<p>If science does arrive at that breakthrough, if you could live forever, would you?</p>
<p>Would you like to live forever?</p>
<p>I think yes.</p>
<p>I would try.</p>
<p>Why not, you know?</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;ll give you a reason not.</p>
<p>Is it makes a life, you know, the fact that stuff ends gives it some deep meaning.</p>
<p>You know, Jewish people, basically, they are deeply, deeply, deeply in love with life.</p>
<p>You know, they say Lechaim, to life.</p>
<p>So Jewish people, they actually believe that God gave us life to enjoy.</p>
<p>What will happen?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll have another life or not.</p>
<p>Or maybe it will be like, again, we&rsquo;ll be young.</p>
<p>Is it possible?</p>
<p>The Jewish answer is absolutely clear.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>So, but enjoying life, it&rsquo;s a law.</p>
<p>Absolute law.</p>
<p>So if you have a possibility to leave, you have to go on with life.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a Jewish answer.</p>
<p>And I like it.</p>
<p>Are you afraid of death?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I remember when you asked me how long did it take for me to fall in love with your mother.</p>
<p>One, two, three.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, you answered that pretty quickly.</p>
<p>So what do you think is the meaning of life?</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s a difficult question.</p>
<p>You never like the silly questions.</p>
<p>Go back to your eighth grade self and be romantic for a second.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the meaning of life?</p>
<p>Yeah, meaning of our existence here on this little planet.</p>
<p>Well, I remember that I kept asking myself this question when I was in eighth grade.</p>
<p>It was one of the crucial questions for me at that time.</p>
<p>By exactly the same time when I wrote this romantic stuff.</p>
<p>And at that time, I remember my answer.</p>
<p>I kept saying, day by day.</p>
<p>Which means the meaning of life is just to enjoy today&rsquo;s life and go to tomorrow.</p>
<p>Survive the day, enjoy the day.</p>
<p>Enjoy the day.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a French existentialist.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re Sartre and‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s Sartre.</p>
<p>But at that time, I didn&rsquo;t have any knowledge about existentialists, whatever, Sartre,</p>
<p>especially Sartre.</p>
<p>But I was absolutely sure about that.</p>
<p>But if you ask me now, I would say I was right.</p>
<p>I thought that was a natural extension of the axiom, which is, I&rsquo;m always right.</p>
<p>Yes, yes, yes.</p>
<p>But you know, in each joke, it&rsquo;s a 50% of joke, 50% not.</p>
<p>But after reading, it was a book, Les mots, words, right?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s in English you say?</p>
<p>Sartre.</p>
<p>Sartre, yeah.</p>
<p>Les mots, words, slova.</p>
<p>I think in this book, he just‚Ä¶</p>
<p>When I read that, it&rsquo;s by the way, absolutely bad book to read.</p>
<p>Yeah, Sartre is‚Ä¶</p>
<p>I prefer Camus and the other French guys.</p>
<p>Yeah, I just understand that I was not alone with this kind of ideas.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s other French guys.</p>
<p>What do you hope Greg and I accomplish in life?</p>
<p>And next, I&rsquo;ll ask you for advice.</p>
<p>And after that, we&rsquo;ll drink some vodka.</p>
<p>Are you calculating?</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m not calculating.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just trying to recall a very nice poetry.</p>
<p>You know, I love Russian poetry.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s interesting that my favorite Russian poet, it&rsquo;s actually a woman.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s Marina Tsvetaeva.</p>
<p>And she wrote like a short poetry, just answering that.</p>
<p>She said,</p>
<p>Well, and it is in Russian, but I think that it&rsquo;s kind of deep and it&rsquo;s kind of smart.</p>
<p>We wish, I wish you to be happy.</p>
<p>And I know that if I push you in some direction,</p>
<p>or Greg, it&rsquo;s nothing happened.</p>
<p>I mean, okay, I will be always recommending.</p>
<p>Yeah, you&rsquo;re always pushing anyway.</p>
<p>And don&rsquo;t forget, I&rsquo;m always pushing anyway.</p>
<p>But you know that.</p>
<p>And I have to do that because I am a father.</p>
<p>So I will, and I&rsquo;m always pushing in conservative direction.</p>
<p>Because, because I&rsquo;m a father.</p>
<p>And I very much wish you to have your son, my grandson, or granddaughter.</p>
<p>And I almost guarantee you that you will do the same.</p>
<p>You will not recommend your daughter to take a risk and to go to Hollywood,</p>
<p>try to be an actress.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s supposed to do it without your permission.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s beautiful.</p>
<p>We make our own way.</p>
<p>And you always have given me brilliant advice</p>
<p>that I almost never follow and usually disagree with.</p>
<p>So, but&hellip;</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the way it should be.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s the way of life.</p>
<p>So what, speaking of which, what advice do you have for me</p>
<p>for the next 10, 20 years in life?</p>
<p>Sort of in any direction.</p>
<p>You see, I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m hesitating, I&rsquo;m thinking about, I mean, I have two ideas and they&rsquo;re kind of very much&hellip;</p>
<p>Opposing?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So from one hand, my approach was the same as Sartre.</p>
<p>So just from one hand, I like the idea just to live your life and to enjoy.</p>
<p>And to be prepared for tomorrow, which everything will restart again.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s from one hand.</p>
<p>From another hand, I remember myself in elementary school.</p>
<p>You remember the beginning of our discussion about these stupid guys,</p>
<p>these idiots with stones.</p>
<p>And I just had an idea just to build a rocket to put there.</p>
<p>So I wanted to do that and I did it.</p>
<p>So this is another idea, when you just put your heart into something for a longer time,</p>
<p>not for one day, but you have to find your own way just&hellip;</p>
<p>And my feeling is that you personally found it with artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why my feeling is that in your specific case, my advice will be just</p>
<p>not to let these idiots with stones to succeed.</p>
<p>You have to be a winner.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what I&hellip;</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what I&hellip;</p>
<p>Maybe don&rsquo;t put the mercury in the rocket, but build the rocket.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s your choice.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Because that&rsquo;s a rocket which you are building.</p>
<p>But what is important?</p>
<p>That you&rsquo;ll do it.</p>
<p>Well, I think this is a good time to maybe toast our family.</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s a good idea.</p>
<p>We thought we&rsquo;ll probably drink more vodka,</p>
<p>but we decided to be responsible adults and just save the vodka to the end.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always a question how much vodka we have to drink.</p>
<p>In Russian tradition, usually we calculate for adults like one bottle per person.</p>
<p>Take a look.</p>
<p>It is made in Soviet Union and it&rsquo;s 1986.</p>
<p>This is vodka of my father because in 1986, in the year of Chernobyl,</p>
<p>he gave this bottle to a friend of mine because this friend of mine, he went to America.</p>
<p>And he just&hellip;</p>
<p>This is my friend.</p>
<p>He just saved this vodka for us to be able to just whatever to think about.</p>
<p>Can we say his name?</p>
<p>Your friend.</p>
<p>Oh, he&rsquo;s Sasha, but we call him Shura, but that&rsquo;s the same thing.</p>
<p>This is your best friend, your lifelong friend.</p>
<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s like your Matt.</p>
<p>My Matt.</p>
<p>Matt Harandy, shout out.</p>
<p>And first, you can toast the family, but let me just toast to the best dad I&rsquo;ve ever had.</p>
<p>The best dad I could ever ask for.</p>
<p>I love you, dad.</p>
<p>Yeah, I love you, son.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening to this conversation with my dad.</p>
<p>And thank you to our sponsors, the Jordan Harbinger Show and Magic Spoon Cereal.</p>
<p>Go check out Jordan&rsquo;s show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, and tell them I sent you.</p>
<p>Listen to the Kobe Bryant or Neil deGrasse Tyson episodes first,</p>
<p>or just binge listen to a bunch of them like I did.</p>

<p>If there are close people in your life who you&rsquo;ve never sat down to really talk with,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re still here with us, talk to them.</p>
<p>Heart to heart, podcast or not.</p>
<p>They won&rsquo;t always be here with us.</p>
<p>Life is short.</p>
<p>And most of it is a distraction from what really matters.</p>
<p>Family, friendship, and love.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening.</p>
<p>And hope to see you next time.</p>
