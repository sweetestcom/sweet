    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>where we discuss science</p>
<p>and science-based tools for everyday life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Andrew Huberman,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology</p>
<p>at Stanford School of Medicine.</p>
<p>This podcast is separate from my teaching</p>
<p>and research roles at Stanford.</p>
<p>It is, however, part of my desire and effort</p>
<p>to bring zero cost to consumer information</p>
<p>about science and science-related tools</p>
<p>to the general public.</p>
<p>In keeping with that theme,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank the sponsors of today&rsquo;s podcast.</p>
<p>Our first sponsor is Four Sigmatic.</p>
<p>Four Sigmatic is a wellness company</p>
<p>that makes mushroom coffee.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re asking yourself,</p>
<p>why would you want to put mushrooms in coffee?</p>
<p>First of all, let me tell you,</p>
<p>these are not psychedelic mushrooms,</p>
<p>and no, the coffee doesn&rsquo;t taste like mushrooms.</p>
<p>The coffee is delicious,</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t taste mushrooms at all.</p>
<p>I know this because I&rsquo;ve been using Four Sigmatic coffee</p>
<p>and been stocking it in my laboratory for several years now,</p>
<p>long before I ever had the podcast</p>
<p>or Four Sigmatic was a sponsor.</p>
<p>The two kinds of mushrooms that are in Four Sigmatic coffee</p>
<p>are lion&rsquo;s mane and chaga mushrooms,</p>
<p>both of which have been shown</p>
<p>to have a slight anxiolytic effect to reduce anxiety.</p>
<p>And lion&rsquo;s mane has also been shown in several studies</p>
<p>to lower the symptoms of depression just slightly,</p>
<p>although I wouldn&rsquo;t consider it a treatment for depression.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an attractive benefit,</p>
<p>as well as have some effect at offsetting cognitive decline,</p>
<p>albeit slightly.</p>
<p>The effects were real in the studies that I&rsquo;ve found.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;d like to try Four Sigmatic,</p>
<p>you can go to foursigmatic.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s F-O-U-R-S-I-G-M-A-T-I-C.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>And if you do that, you&rsquo;ll get 40% off your order</p>
<p>plus free shipping on mushroom coffee bundles.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s foursigmatic.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>for up to 40% off and free shipping.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Blinkist.</p>
<p>Blinkist is an app that has thousands of nonfiction books</p>
<p>condensed down to just 15 minutes of key takeaways</p>
<p>that you can read or listen to.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a big reader and I&rsquo;m a big consumer of nonfiction.</p>
<p>And most of the time I consume books</p>
<p>in their traditional form,</p>
<p>like a book where you flip the pages and so forth.</p>
<p>I also listen to full length audio books.</p>
<p>However, over time, we know that we forget lots of things.</p>
<p>And even though sometimes I think</p>
<p>I got all the critical information from a book,</p>
<p>when I listen to Blinkist and I get the 15 minute rundown,</p>
<p>either in audio or in written form,</p>
<p>what I find is there are key points</p>
<p>that oftentimes I missed.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s a great way for me to both jog my memory</p>
<p>and to bring forward ideas</p>
<p>that I hadn&rsquo;t considered previously.</p>
<p>They have thousands of nonfiction titles</p>
<p>and some really terrific ones in the science category.</p>
<p>For example, David Eagleman&rsquo;s book, Livewired,</p>
<p>which came out recently is a book I read in full length form</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve listened to the Blinkist version of it as well.</p>
<p>Livewired is a book about neuroplasticity,</p>
<p>the brain&rsquo;s ability to change in response to experience.</p>
<p>I get so many questions and requests for books</p>
<p>about neuroplasticity.</p>
<p>In my opinion, Livewired is the most recent and up-to-date</p>
<p>and the best one to date.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s there.</p>
<p>David Sinclair&rsquo;s book, Lifespan.</p>
<p>David, as many of you know,</p>
<p>is a professor of genetics at Harvard Medical School.</p>
<p>Lifespan is this terrific book about aging as a disease</p>
<p>and the future and present of longevity treatments.</p>
<p>Very interesting book.</p>
<p>As well as Matt Walker&rsquo;s book, Why We Sleep.</p>
<p>Matt, of course, is a professor at UC Berkeley</p>
<p>and Why We Sleep is a terrific book about why we sleep,</p>
<p>the science of sleeping and things you can do</p>
<p>to improve your sleep.</p>
<p>All of those are on Blinkist.</p>
<p>But with Blinkist, you get unlimited access</p>
<p>to their massive library of nonfiction.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Blinkist,</p>
<p>right now they have a special offer just for our audience,</p>
<p>just for Huberman Lab podcast listeners.</p>
<p>You can go to blinkist.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>and you can try Blinkist free for seven days.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s zero cost</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll get 25% off your new subscription.</p>

<p>This episode is also brought to us by Monk Pack.</p>
<p>Monk Pack is a company that makes keto-friendly snacks</p>
<p>that taste incredible,</p>
<p>but have just one gram of sugar or less.</p>
<p>As I&rsquo;ve said before on this podcast,</p>
<p>I am not in ketosis, I&rsquo;m not ketogenic.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t advocate or follow any one particular diet.</p>
<p>For me, what works is to fast in the early part of the day</p>
<p>and to eat low carb and keto-ish throughout the day.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s for alertness and attention,</p>
<p>so I can work and focus</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t feel sluggish or brain fog.</p>
<p>And then at night and in the evening</p>
<p>is when I tend to eat my carbohydrates</p>
<p>to aid the transition to sleep.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what works for me.</p>
<p>Monk Pack bars are a terrific snack,</p>
<p>whether or not you&rsquo;re keto all the time,</p>
<p>whether or not you&rsquo;re low carb, or even if you&rsquo;re not,</p>
<p>they are absolutely delicious.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t say that lightly.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a big fan of bars in general.</p>
<p>Most bars to me tastes like a combination of,</p>
<p>you know, a metal bumper mixed with some cardboard</p>
<p>and some lawn trimmings and some artificial sugar.</p>
<p>Monk Pack bars, when they were sent to me,</p>
<p>I was like, all right, I&rsquo;ll try them.</p>
<p>I tried it, like, uh-oh, this is a problem</p>
<p>because I like them very, very much.</p>
<p>And when I say it&rsquo;s a problem, it really is a problem.</p>
<p>And I actually keep the Monk Pack boxes in my basement</p>
<p>so that I don&rsquo;t tear through them all at once.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a huge fan of the caramel sea salt flavor.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s delicious, just talking about it</p>
<p>makes me hungry for one.</p>
<p>But they also have sea salt, dark chocolate,</p>
<p>peanut butter, dark chocolate.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re terrific.</p>
<p>In addition to being keto friendly,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re also gluten-free, plant-based, non-GMO,</p>
<p>no soy, trans fat, sugar alcohols, or artificial colors.</p>
<p>So all the bad stuff that you don&rsquo;t want.</p>
<p>And as I mentioned before,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re keto, less than one gram of sugar.</p>

<p>This month, we&rsquo;ve been talking all about hormones,</p>
<p>which are these absolutely incredible chemicals</p>
<p>in our brain and body.</p>
<p>They impact our entire lifespan.</p>
<p>So from the time that we are in the womb,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re controlling the development</p>
<p>of our brain and our bodies.</p>
<p>After we are born, they&rsquo;re still controlling</p>
<p>the development of our brain and bodies.</p>
<p>And I did say development,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s because contrary to what most people think,</p>
<p>development lasts the entire lifespan.</p>
<p>From the time you&rsquo;re conceived until the time you die,</p>
<p>you are developing, you are changing,</p>
<p>and hormones are constantly updating and changing</p>
<p>the different functions of your body.</p>
<p>They have two major kinds of effects.</p>
<p>One are immediate effects, so they can actually bind to</p>
<p>or kind of park in parking spots on cells</p>
<p>and impact all sorts of things</p>
<p>like the growth of cells, et cetera.</p>
<p>They also can control gene expression.</p>
<p>This is the way that hormones during puberty</p>
<p>control body hair growth and breast development</p>
<p>and growth of muscles and limbs and height</p>
<p>and all sorts of things.</p>
<p>They are incredible.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve talked about testosterone and estrogen.</p>
<p>We talked about insulin and glucagon</p>
<p>and some of the other things.</p>
<p>Today, we are going to talk about metabolism,</p>
<p>mainly going to talk about thyroid hormone</p>
<p>and growth hormone and some other related pathways.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to explain to you the logic</p>
<p>of how thyroid hormone and growth hormone work.</p>
<p>It will become obvious why I&rsquo;ve paired thyroid</p>
<p>and growth hormone together in the same episode.</p>
<p>And I will, of course, talk about tools that you can use</p>
<p>to elevate or reduce thyroid hormone.</p>
<p>There are cases where people want to reduce thyroid hormone.</p>
<p>I will talk about tools that you can use</p>
<p>to elevate growth hormone.</p>
<p>There are rare cases where people want</p>
<p>to reduce growth hormone.</p>
<p>Most people are interested in increasing growth hormone.</p>
<p>So today is going to be rich with information,</p>
<p>rich with actionable tools.</p>
<p>And as always, the idea is to spell out</p>
<p>an organizational logic so you can come away</p>
<p>from this episode, and in fact, the entire month</p>
<p>on hormones, really understanding at some level</p>
<p>what these things we call hormones are and how they work.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s really to arm you to encounter information</p>
<p>going forward, whether or not it comes from me</p>
<p>or from somebody else, a book or a course,</p>
<p>someplace else online, to make sense of how to work</p>
<p>with these incredible chemicals we call hormones.</p>
<p>Before we begin to talk about thyroid and growth hormone</p>
<p>and how our metabolism works</p>
<p>and how to control metabolism,</p>
<p>I want to answer a few questions that I received from you,</p>
<p>from the audience.</p>
<p>Every once in a while, someone will send me</p>
<p>a quite earnest question about something they saw</p>
<p>on the internet.</p>
<p>And one of the things I&rsquo;ve heard about quite a bit</p>
<p>in the last couple of weeks is we&rsquo;ve been talking</p>
<p>about hormones and food intake and how those interact</p>
<p>is this question of, are certain foods particularly good</p>
<p>for certain organs of the body?</p>
<p>And can that be predicted on the basis of the shape</p>
<p>of those foods?</p>
<p>So first of all, I want to acknowledge the question</p>
<p>as a valid one, because I see this every once in a while</p>
<p>out there, people will say, well, you know,</p>
<p>walnuts are in the shape of the brain</p>
<p>and therefore they are good for your brain,</p>
<p>or, you know, a particular fruit like the beet</p>
<p>often looks like a heart and it&rsquo;s good for your heart.</p>
<p>And I certainly invite questions of all kinds</p>
<p>provided they are sincere questions.</p>
<p>However, I am not aware of any science whatsoever</p>
<p>supporting the idea that the shape of a given food</p>
<p>or object for that matter is relevant to its functional role</p>
<p>in the body in reference to biology.</p>
<p>Now, beets contain something</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re going to talk about today.</p>
<p>They contain a substance called arginine,</p>
<p>which actually can control the dilation</p>
<p>of blood vessels and arteries.</p>
<p>So it has some relationship to heart and heart health.</p>
<p>Walnuts contain various fatty acids that may be,</p>
<p>I want to underscore may be beneficial</p>
<p>for certain aspects of brain health,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s no evidence whatsoever</p>
<p>that the shape of the food itself is relevant.</p>
<p>And, you know, I think what&rsquo;s happened is,</p>
<p>is that people have gone out there and found foods</p>
<p>that contain certain substances like carrots</p>
<p>and vitamin A or walnuts and particular fatty acids</p>
<p>or beets and arginine, and they&rsquo;ve selected the foods</p>
<p>that happen to be in the shape of the thing,</p>
<p>the organ that the particular substance like vitamin A</p>
<p>or fatty acids and so forth might benefit or support.</p>
<p>But of course, there are many, many other sources</p>
<p>of these nutrients that don&rsquo;t come from walnuts</p>
<p>or from beets or from carrots.</p>
<p>And so I guess the short way to put it is that the idea</p>
<p>that the shape of some food is an indication</p>
<p>of whether or not that food would be healthy</p>
<p>for a particular organ in the body is absolutely unfounded.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know of any evidence for it.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not out to quash anybody&rsquo;s great love</p>
<p>of these foods.</p>
<p>I enjoy all the foods I just described,</p>
<p>but the shape of things in the physical universe</p>
<p>bears very little, if any, relevance to the nutrients</p>
<p>that it contains and therefore the organs that it supports.</p>
<p>So thank you for your question.</p>
<p>But if you see that out there, I don&rsquo;t even think you need</p>
<p>to tell the person who&rsquo;s putting that information</p>
<p>out into the world.</p>
<p>I would just back away slowly.</p>
<p>One other thing before we move into today&rsquo;s material.</p>
<p>Last episode, I talked about the problems with emulsifiers</p>
<p>in highly processed foods and the way that they can strip</p>
<p>the mucosal lining of the gut and they can limit</p>
<p>the signaling of hormones like CCK that can signal</p>
<p>to the brain satiety, the signal to stop eating.</p>
<p>And then we got into a discussion</p>
<p>about artificial sweeteners.</p>
<p>And I threw out stevia as an artificial sweetener</p>
<p>and several people reached out to correct me</p>
<p>that stevia is not an artificial sweetener.</p>
<p>It is a non-caloric sweetener and you are correct.</p>
<p>I lumped artificial and non-caloric sweeteners together.</p>
<p>And thanks to many of you that also sent me some references,</p>
<p>it does not appear that stevia can negatively impact</p>
<p>the gut microbiome.</p>
<p>It does seem unique among non-caloric sweeteners.</p>
<p>There are probably others out there.</p>
<p>The other thing that we discussed is how stevia can lead</p>
<p>to slight increases in blood glucose,</p>
<p>but can also improve insulin management just slightly,</p>
<p>probably cancels to zero in terms of its impact</p>
<p>on blood glucose provided it&rsquo;s not at concentrations</p>
<p>that are super, super sweet.</p>
<p>Ingestion of anything that&rsquo;s very sweet,</p>
<p>whether or not it contains calories or not,</p>
<p>artificial or not, will create an insulin response.</p>
<p>In fact, just walking past a bakery</p>
<p>and smelling delicious baked goods</p>
<p>can increase your insulin secretion.</p>
<p>And so I just want to point that out.</p>
<p>Thank you for the information and the references</p>
<p>that you found.</p>
<p>Please send additional ones if you do find them.</p>
<p>And I appreciate that you allow me to make corrections.</p>
<p>Every once in a while I misspeak here</p>
<p>and the opportunity to make corrections</p>
<p>keeps us all on the same page.</p>
<p>And please do keep any feedback that you have</p>
<p>about particular things I cover here coming my way.</p>
<p>There is so much interest in metabolism.</p>
<p>We hear about having a high or a low metabolism.</p>
<p>There are some people out there who would like</p>
<p>to reduce their metabolism.</p>
<p>They simply can&rsquo;t eat enough to maintain their weight.</p>
<p>Most people, however, struggle with the opposite issue.</p>
<p>They struggle to maintain a healthy weight</p>
<p>and or their metabolism is too low.</p>
<p>Now there are a variety of reasons</p>
<p>why metabolism can be low.</p>
<p>Today we are going to talk about two hormones,</p>
<p>thyroid hormone and its related pathways</p>
<p>and growth hormone and its related pathways,</p>
<p>which arguably are the two hormones</p>
<p>and two systems in the body that are most significant</p>
<p>for setting your overall level of metabolism.</p>
<p>Before we dive into those,</p>
<p>I just want to cover a little bit of what metabolism is.</p>
<p>And I want to talk about which organs in your body</p>
<p>use the most energy.</p>
<p>So metabolism is the consumption of energy,</p>
<p>not necessarily eating,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s the use of energy in the cells of the body</p>
<p>for growth of tissues, for repair of tissues,</p>
<p>and also just for day-to-day maintenance of function.</p>
<p>A good example of maintenance of function</p>
<p>would be your brain.</p>
<p>Most of your metabolic needs,</p>
<p>your so-called basal or resting metabolic needs</p>
<p>are for your brain, for thinking.</p>
<p>If you were to just sit in a bed all day</p>
<p>and do nothing but think,</p>
<p>that consumes about 75% of your metabolic needs.</p>
<p>Now there&rsquo;s also moving around.</p>
<p>If you have a job that requires a lot of heavy labor</p>
<p>or lifting things, or you&rsquo;re a new parent</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re carrying kids around</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re going up and down the stairs</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re back and forth to the refrigerator for formula,</p>
<p>et cetera, well, then you&rsquo;re burning more energy,</p>
<p>burning more calories.</p>
<p>But even if you are very physically active,</p>
<p>unless you&rsquo;re an ultra marathoner or a marathoner,</p>
<p>chances are that 75% of your metabolic needs</p>
<p>are coming just from your brain.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because neurons consume a lot of energy.</p>
<p>Neurons, of course, are just the nerve cells of your brain.</p>
<p>So these two hormones, thyroid hormone and growth hormone,</p>
<p>we think of as related to metabolism of things in the body,</p>
<p>keeping body fat low and keeping muscles strong</p>
<p>and tendons strong and repairing themselves, et cetera.</p>
<p>But they are also key for brain function,</p>
<p>for the ability to maintain cognitive function</p>
<p>throughout the lifespan.</p>
<p>So the big theme I&rsquo;d like to introduce</p>
<p>is that metabolism isn&rsquo;t just about losing weight,</p>
<p>but having a high metabolism,</p>
<p>provided it&rsquo;s not too high, is great.</p>
<p>It means that you will have more lean tissue,</p>
<p>more bone and muscle, and less adipose tissue, fat.</p>
<p>And we know that that&rsquo;s healthy.</p>
<p>How much fat and how much muscle?</p>
<p>Well, that varies,</p>
<p>and the numbers on this are always shifting.</p>
<p>But in general, muscle and its related tissues</p>
<p>burns more energy than does adipose tissue or fat.</p>
<p>And the water in your body doesn&rsquo;t consume any energy.</p>
<p>So metabolism can be increased</p>
<p>simply by adding muscle to your body and reducing fat</p>
<p>or adjusting the ratio of the two.</p>
<p>But regardless,</p>
<p>even if you&rsquo;re not interested in changing body composition,</p>
<p>these two hormones, thyroid hormone and growth hormone</p>
<p>are super important for metabolism of all kinds,</p>
<p>including tissue repair after injury,</p>
<p>including maintaining cognitive function and wellbeing</p>
<p>and the ability to think clearly as you age,</p>
<p>offsetting dementia and so forth.</p>
<p>So the big theme here really includes the previous episodes.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to have seen those episodes,</p>
<p>but for the last three episodes and today as well,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve been talking about hormones,</p>
<p>these substances that are released</p>
<p>from one location in the body</p>
<p>that go and act other locations in the body.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to tell you how that works</p>
<p>for thyroid and growth hormone.</p>
<p>But now that you&rsquo;ve heard about testosterone and estrogen,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re going to hear about thyroid and growth hormone,</p>
<p>I want you to realize that there&rsquo;s a repeating logic.</p>
<p>First of all, there are neurons in your brain</p>
<p>in an area called the hypothalamus,</p>
<p>which it just means it&rsquo;s below the thalamus hypo.</p>
<p>It sits at the base of your brain in the front,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s part of the forebrain.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s more or less above the roof of your mouth,</p>
<p>maybe about a centimeter or so,</p>
<p>and then about a centimeter forward in most people.</p>
<p>And neurons in the hypothalamus</p>
<p>release hormones that are called releasing hormones.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve talked in previous episodes about, for instance,</p>
<p>gonadotropin releasing hormone.</p>
<p>So those are little neurons that then signal</p>
<p>another brain area called the pituitary</p>
<p>to release other hormones.</p>
<p>Today, we&rsquo;re going to see this again.</p>
<p>In the brain, you have neurons</p>
<p>that release thyrotropin or thyroid releasing hormone.</p>
<p>You also have growth hormone releasing hormone.</p>
<p>So anytime you hear releasing,</p>
<p>chances are those are neurons that are in your brain</p>
<p>and they extend little wires,</p>
<p>we call axons, into your pituitary.</p>
<p>And the pituitary releases a bunch of hormones</p>
<p>into the bloodstream.</p>
<p>And the pituitary releases things</p>
<p>that most often have the name of stimulating hormone</p>
<p>because they stimulate organs.</p>
<p>So in keeping with the theme of thyroid hormone,</p>
<p>you have thyroid releasing hormone in the brain,</p>
<p>tells the pituitary to release thyroid stimulating hormone.</p>
<p>And then the thyroid, which we&rsquo;ll talk about in a moment,</p>
<p>releases thyroid hormones.</p>
<p>In the testosterone and estrogen episode,</p>
<p>we talked about how you have gonadotropin releasing hormone.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the releasing again up in the brain,</p>
<p>remember, releasing hormone comes from the brain.</p>
<p>Then you had things like luteinizing hormone</p>
<p>and follicle stimulating hormone,</p>
<p>which were in the pituitary</p>
<p>and those traveled to the ovaries or the testes</p>
<p>and acted on those tissues, okay?</p>
<p>So please try and embed this logic.</p>
<p>If you hear the word releasing hormone,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s coming from the brain</p>
<p>and that makes it actionable in certain ways</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ll return to later.</p>
<p>In addition, the pituitary is letting go</p>
<p>of all these hormones into the bloodstream</p>
<p>that are stimulating different tissues.</p>
<p>So for thyroid, it&rsquo;s thyroid stimulating hormone,</p>
<p>and then it goes to the thyroid.</p>
<p>And the thyroid is a little butterfly shaped gland</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s right around the Adam&rsquo;s apple.</p>
<p>If you want to see yours,</p>
<p>not directly because it&rsquo;s got skin over it,</p>
<p>what you would do is you&rsquo;d take a sip of water,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d look in the mirror and you&rsquo;d swallow.</p>
<p>And the thing that moves up and down, that is your thyroid.</p>
<p>Now, some people call it your Adam&rsquo;s apple</p>
<p>because it sits right near this protrusion in the trachea,</p>
<p>which is the Adam&rsquo;s apple.</p>
<p>No matter whether or not you&rsquo;re male, female,</p>
<p>or regardless of what your chromosomal background is,</p>
<p>everyone has an Adam&rsquo;s apple.</p>
<p>It tends to be more pronounced in people</p>
<p>that got a surge of testosterone early in development</p>
<p>because it has a testosterone sensitivity to it.</p>
<p>And that actually controls the timbre,</p>
<p>the so-called deepness of the voice.</p>
<p>So the thyroid gland sits right there</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s got four little bumps behind it</p>
<p>called the parathyroid gland.</p>
<p>And it releases two hormones into the blood</p>
<p>to stimulate different tissues and their metabolism.</p>
<p>And those hormones are called T4 and T3.</p>
<p>So if this is already sounding like a lot of information,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really easy, I promise.</p>
<p>Releasing hormone comes to the brain,</p>
<p>stimulating hormone comes from the pituitary.</p>
<p>And in this case, we&rsquo;re talking about the thyroid</p>
<p>binding up that stimulating hormone and saying,</p>
<p>oh, I need to release something that releases T4 and T3.</p>
<p>And guess what?</p>
<p>You can basically forget about T4.</p>
<p>T4, it&rsquo;s not completely inactive.</p>
<p>It has some roles, but T3 is the one</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s more or less active.</p>
<p>Now, what does thyroid hormone do?</p>
<p>A lot of people think, oh, thyroid, it&rsquo;s like metabolism.</p>
<p>And people who are hypothyroid</p>
<p>all have bulging eyes and are real thin.</p>
<p>And people who have hypothyroid are overweight</p>
<p>and they have like, their eyes are like,</p>
<p>are, you know, half closed or something.</p>
<p>And indeed, thyroid hormone controls a lot of the features</p>
<p>of the face and the eyes and it can control amounts</p>
<p>of adipose tissue and so forth.</p>
<p>But the main role of thyroid hormone of T3</p>
<p>is to promote metabolism.</p>
<p>And that doesn&rsquo;t just mean the consumption of energy,</p>
<p>it means the utilization of energy,</p>
<p>including the buildup of tissues.</p>
<p>So it acts on all sorts of target tissues in the body.</p>
<p>It acts on muscle, it acts on the liver,</p>
<p>it acts on the cartilage, it acts on the bone.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not just involved in using energy,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s also converting energy.</p>
<p>I do realize I said that twice.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s involved in taking fats</p>
<p>and breaking them down into fatty acids</p>
<p>and converting those into ATP,</p>
<p>which is an important thing for cells to use energy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also involved in taking sugars</p>
<p>and turning those into energy.</p>
<p>And yes, it goes to adipose tissue to fat.</p>
<p>We have different kinds of fat that we&rsquo;ll talk about today,</p>
<p>but it goes to white fat and it liberates</p>
<p>or helps liberate some of the fats from those fat cells</p>
<p>and use them for energy.</p>
<p>And this is why higher thyroid</p>
<p>is associated with leaner bodies.</p>
<p>Lower thyroid is associated with less lean bodies.</p>
<p>So one thing that&rsquo;s absolutely key and is actionable,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re right there already in discussing tools is iodine.</p>
<p>Iodine comes from things in the ocean, right?</p>
<p>And here are a couple of interesting facts about iodine.</p>
<p>And then we&rsquo;ll talk about whether or not</p>
<p>you should be supplementing iodine or not.</p>
<p>First of all, iodine is most common in sea salt,</p>
<p>in kelp and in seaweed.</p>
<p>And most people can get enough iodine</p>
<p>from the food they eat and or the table salt they consume.</p>
<p>Almost all table salt from all over the world,</p>
<p>regardless of where you are, contains iodine.</p>
<p>The thyroid needs iodine in order to produce thyroid hormone</p>
<p>and you need sufficient levels of thyroid hormone,</p>
<p>not too much, but you need it.</p>
<p>So chances are you are getting enough iodine,</p>
<p>although you might not,</p>
<p>especially those of you following a particularly</p>
<p>quote unquote clean diet might not be getting enough iodine.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the deal with iodine.</p>
<p>Iodine combines with an amino acid</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve talked about before called L-tyrosine.</p>
<p>L-tyrosine comes from meat, from nuts.</p>
<p>There are some plant-based sources as well.</p>
<p>It is the precursor to dopamine.</p>
<p>But in the thyroid, iodine combines or works with L-tyrosine</p>
<p>to produce T3 and T4, the thyroid hormone.</p>
<p>So you absolutely need sufficient iodine.</p>
<p>You need sufficient L-tyrosine.</p>
<p>And then you also need something else,</p>
<p>which is called selenium.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll talk about selenium in a moment.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a condition that shows up</p>
<p>in little pockets in the world.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not super common,</p>
<p>meaning it&rsquo;s not very widespread,</p>
<p>but in certain areas that are far away from the ocean,</p>
<p>at one point this was historically</p>
<p>in the Midwestern states of the United States,</p>
<p>in some mountain regions of other countries,</p>
<p>in some areas of Africa that were far from the ocean,</p>
<p>people would get extremely swollen bulges in their necks.</p>
<p>And this was called goiter.</p>
<p>And the reason they were getting those swollen bulges</p>
<p>is because the thyroid itself was hypertrophying.</p>
<p>It was growing in an attempt to churn out more thyroid,</p>
<p>and because it was getting a lot of stimulating hormone</p>
<p>from the pituitary.</p>
<p>But, and I don&rsquo;t want to go too far off track here,</p>
<p>but as you recall,</p>
<p>the brain and the pituitary are paying attention</p>
<p>in a cellular sense to the levels of hormones in the blood.</p>
<p>And when those hormones get too high,</p>
<p>they shut off the stimulating hormone.</p>
<p>They shut down the signal to make more,</p>
<p>kind of like a thermostat.</p>
<p>When the levels are too low,</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s not enough testosterone in the bloodstream,</p>
<p>or there&rsquo;s not enough estrogen,</p>
<p>the brain will continue to push out the signal to make more.</p>
<p>Similarly, if there&rsquo;s not enough thyroid circulating,</p>
<p>or there&rsquo;s not enough iodine to make thyroid,</p>
<p>therefore not enough thyroid hormone circulating,</p>
<p>the thyroid gland itself is not getting shut down.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s tons of stimulating hormone and releasing hormone</p>
<p>coming from the brain, like release, release, release.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s no way they can make thyroid hormone</p>
<p>instead the gland just gets bigger and bigger and bigger.</p>
<p>And so people get goiter.</p>
<p>This is one of the reasons why table salt has iodine in it.</p>
<p>Although there are other foods</p>
<p>that have iodine in it as well.</p>
<p>So how much iodine do you need?</p>
<p>Well, you don&rsquo;t need a whole lot.</p>
<p>Some people who are hypothyroidal might,</p>
<p>and I want to emphasize might,</p>
<p>you absolutely should talk to your doctor.</p>
<p>This is a serious matter.</p>
<p>Anytime you&rsquo;re talking about hormones</p>
<p>or manipulating levels of thyroid,</p>
<p>you absolutely want to talk to your doctor.</p>
<p>Some people benefit from supplementing iodine.</p>
<p>It is contained in most salts.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s in Himalayan salt, not always, but often.</p>
<p>I know these days there&rsquo;s a lot of excitement</p>
<p>about pink salts and sea salts,</p>
<p>and the kind of artisan salt thing</p>
<p>has kind of taken off in the foodie land, which is great.</p>
<p>Some of them are actually quite tasty.</p>
<p>You can just take it directly if you like the taste of salt.</p>
<p>But iodine can be supplemented through things like kelp</p>
<p>and seaweed and kelp tablets.</p>
<p>Now, if you are hyperthyroidal, you make too much thyroid,</p>
<p>that actually can be a problem.</p>
<p>So really the best way to figure this out</p>
<p>is to get your blood levels tested of thyroid hormone.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s so much iodine in the ocean</p>
<p>that believe it or not, people that live near the coast</p>
<p>can actually just absorb it through the air</p>
<p>just by breathing ocean air.</p>
<p>So that gives you a sense of just how little iodine</p>
<p>you actually need to consume in food or in salt.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re within a few miles of the ocean</p>
<p>or you visit the ocean from time to time,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re probably getting plenty.</p>
<p>It does have to come together, as I mentioned,</p>
<p>with L-tyrosine, and this is why foods</p>
<p>that contain L-tyrosine,</p>
<p>and provided that you have sufficient iodine in your diet,</p>
<p>and if you have sufficient selenium in your diet,</p>
<p>does serve to increase your metabolism.</p>
<p>And that is, again, is for the growth and repair of tissues.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s really important.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just about keeping your metabolism high</p>
<p>so that you can be on the leaner side of things</p>
<p>or adjust your body weight, excuse me,</p>
<p>your body composition ratios the way you like.</p>
<p>Repair of injuries, repair of brain tissue,</p>
<p>clearance of any damage from neurons,</p>
<p>clearance of any damage to the body</p>
<p>is also going to depend on thyroid.</p>
<p>Again, metabolism being this kind of rate</p>
<p>of fuel consumption and use in the body generally,</p>
<p>not just about body mass indexes and things of that sort.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about selenium because it&rsquo;s really important.</p>
<p>And even though most people are getting</p>
<p>a lot of sufficient iodine,</p>
<p>and most people are probably getting enough L-tyrosine,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m guessing most people may not be getting enough selenium</p>
<p>if their goal is to increase thyroid hormone,</p>
<p>at least that&rsquo;s what the literature says.</p>
<p>Without going into the biochemistry,</p>
<p>selenium is important in order for thyroid hormone</p>
<p>to be made because of the way that it allows L-tyrosine</p>
<p>and iodine to interact.</p>
<p>And the thing is, most people aren&rsquo;t getting enough selenium</p>
<p>because they don&rsquo;t eat foods that are high in selenium.</p>
<p>Now, how much selenium you need</p>
<p>will depend on where you live.</p>
<p>It actually varies country by country.</p>
<p>Some countries I found say that you should get</p>
<p>a hundred micrograms, some say 200, some say 155.</p>
<p>The average was about 155 micrograms,</p>
<p>the countries I looked at.</p>
<p>People who are trying to increase thyroid levels</p>
<p>might want to consume more selenium.</p>
<p>And if you consume a vitamin, of course,</p>
<p>you want to make sure if it has selenium</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re not overdoing it by consuming</p>
<p>a lot of selenium rich foods either.</p>
<p>But nonetheless, I think it&rsquo;s fair to say</p>
<p>that most people probably could do well</p>
<p>by ingesting slightly more selenium</p>
<p>than they currently are.</p>
<p>Although, of course, always talk to your doctor.</p>
<p>Brazil nuts are the heavyweight champion of foods</p>
<p>to get selenium from.</p>
<p>It has very high concentrations of selenium.</p>
<p>In just six or eight, Brazil nuts contain something</p>
<p>like 550 micrograms of selenium.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also present in fish.</p>
<p>So certain fish like yellowfin tuna,</p>
<p>although nowadays, whenever I mentioned tuna or shellfish,</p>
<p>which is the other rich source of selenium,</p>
<p>people will tell me immediately,</p>
<p>there are all sorts of issues around farm,</p>
<p>not farmed, mercury, et cetera.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve never particularly liked eating fish</p>
<p>because of the way it tastes.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why I avoid it.</p>
<p>But for those of you that like it,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re much more skilled in knowing</p>
<p>which fish to buy and which fish not to buy.</p>
<p>Ham, of all things, contains a lot of selenium.</p>
<p>For whatever reason, pork does.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a big consumer of pork.</p>
<p>Beef has some selenium.</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s interesting, if you look at the sources,</p>
<p>pork, beef, turkey, chicken, cottage cheese,</p>
<p>eggs, brown rice, what you want to understand</p>
<p>is that Brazil nuts, six to eight Brazil nuts,</p>
<p>has 550 micrograms of selenium.</p>
<p>And all the other foods I mentioned,</p>
<p>at much greater portion size than equivalent</p>
<p>to six or eight Brazil nuts,</p>
<p>either by volume or by calories,</p>
<p>they have something like 30 to 50 micrograms of selenium.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re not eating Brazil nuts,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m guessing most people aren&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re not eating a lot of animal-based foods,</p>
<p>which I know many of you aren&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re probably not getting enough selenium.</p>
<p>And again, you can have these levels measured</p>
<p>or you can just check what you&rsquo;re consuming</p>
<p>and figure out whether or not you&rsquo;re meeting</p>
<p>the ration that you need in order</p>
<p>to get healthy levels of thyroid.</p>
<p>It is present in things like mushrooms,</p>
<p>but again, in a bowl of mushrooms,</p>
<p>what is the equivalent to a bowl of mushrooms?</p>
<p>12 micrograms of selenium.</p>
<p>And if the daily ration is something</p>
<p>in the 100 to 200 range,</p>
<p>again, look it up for the area you are,</p>
<p>you can see really quickly why,</p>
<p>even though things like mushrooms and spinach</p>
<p>and milk and yogurt and lentils and cashews,</p>
<p>so now we&rsquo;re into the vegetarian segment</p>
<p>of the list that I constructed,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re probably not getting enough selenium.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s kind of an interesting thing</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re an experimenter</p>
<p>and you get the clearance from your doctor,</p>
<p>you could try increasing your selenium levels</p>
<p>and see how that impacts your metabolism.</p>
<p>Again, Brazil nuts are probably going to be</p>
<p>the most direct way to get sufficient selenium levels,</p>
<p>but because levels are so high in Brazil nuts,</p>
<p>it also means that you could overdo it as well.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not really aware of what the consequences are</p>
<p>of getting too much selenium,</p>
<p>although you can get too much of anything</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m guessing those consequences aren&rsquo;t good.</p>
<p>I also want to mention that for children,</p>
<p>their daily requirements of selenium are much lower,</p>
<p>as low as 30 or 40 micrograms for kids 14 years or younger.</p>
<p>And in some areas, I really want to underscore this,</p>
<p>the amount of selenium that&rsquo;s recommended daily</p>
<p>is as low as 55 micrograms.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not that you should be shooting for thousands</p>
<p>or even high levels of hundreds of micrograms of selenium,</p>
<p>and again, that&rsquo;s micrograms, not milligrams.</p>
<p>So again, look into what you need,</p>
<p>but if you&rsquo;re somebody who&rsquo;s interested</p>
<p>in keeping thyroid function healthy and productive,</p>
<p>then you certainly want to make sure</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re getting enough iodine,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re getting enough selenium,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re getting enough L-tyrosine.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s interesting when you start looking</p>
<p>at the various foods, especially highly processed foods,</p>
<p>then you start to realize that perhaps many people,</p>
<p>maybe you are not.</p>
<p>Not incidentally, selenium has some other effects on health</p>
<p>that can be quite positive.</p>
<p>And even though these don&rsquo;t relate to thyroid</p>
<p>or growth hormone function specifically,</p>
<p>I think you might want to know about them</p>
<p>given that we&rsquo;re on the topic of selenium.</p>
<p>The first is that there are three studies,</p>
<p>all of which showed very high efficacy</p>
<p>for reducing the risk of something called preeclampsia.</p>
<p>Preeclampsia is seizures that are related</p>
<p>to blood pressure issues during</p>
<p>or around the delivery of a new baby.</p>
<p>And it actually, it&rsquo;s a rare-ish condition,</p>
<p>but it actually can be quite deadly.</p>
<p>And so the fact that selenium is important</p>
<p>for offsetting preeclampsia risk is interesting.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know the exact mechanism,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m guessing there are only a few of you out there</p>
<p>that are either pregnant or thinking of conceiving soon,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s worth noting.</p>
<p>Obviously, anything related to pregnancy or lactation,</p>
<p>especially talk to your doctor.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m guessing that selenium is probably</p>
<p>in a lot of prenatal formulas,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s one clear benefit of having sufficient selenium.</p>
<p>The other is a reduced prostate cancer risk.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a study showing that having sufficient selenium</p>
<p>can reduce prostate cancer risk.</p>
<p>And there is some evidence that if you consume foods</p>
<p>from areas with soil that&rsquo;s low in selenium,</p>
<p>that can be a problem.</p>
<p>And last episode, we talked about all these issues</p>
<p>related to soil quality,</p>
<p>things that are making their way into food</p>
<p>that are disrupting hormones and so forth.</p>
<p>But having sufficient selenium from food</p>
<p>could offset the low content in any soil.</p>
<p>And so that apparently can reduce prostate cancer risk.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a minor effect,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a statistically significant one.</p>
<p>And the other one is a reduction in acne,</p>
<p>which is interesting.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m guessing that that probably has to do</p>
<p>with the thyroid hormone pathway</p>
<p>because of the way thyroid hormone can impact the liver.</p>
<p>And it turns out that the liver</p>
<p>and various biochemical reactions in the liver</p>
<p>can impact acne.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s probably an episode all into itself,</p>
<p>but those are just some additional benefits</p>
<p>of getting sufficient selenium.</p>
<p>Okay, so we&rsquo;re already deep into tools</p>
<p>related to making sure that you have sufficient selenium,</p>
<p>iodine, and L-tyrosine in order to make enough</p>
<p>thyroid hormones that can support your metabolic processes</p>
<p>in your liver, your muscles, your tendons,</p>
<p>for whatever purpose, keeping your metabolism high</p>
<p>for body composition reasons or for healing,</p>
<p>for keeping your brain working well.</p>
<p>Earlier, I mentioned there are people</p>
<p>who are following very clean diets.</p>
<p>So these are people that consume no processed foods.</p>
<p>You know, any starch they might eat</p>
<p>is going to be maybe a rice or a grain,</p>
<p>or any protein they might consume</p>
<p>is going to be either from, let&rsquo;s hope,</p>
<p>from humanely raised animal sources</p>
<p>or maybe they&rsquo;re pure plant-based.</p>
<p>Believe it or not, those folks are actually</p>
<p>very susceptible to low iodine</p>
<p>because it turns out that diets that are very meat-rich</p>
<p>and don&rsquo;t have many vegetables,</p>
<p>as well as diets that are very vegetable-rich</p>
<p>but don&rsquo;t have many meats or salts</p>
<p>are at risk of lowering thyroid hormone</p>
<p>by way of the iodine pathway and other pathways.</p>
<p>And so let me try and simplify this for you.</p>
<p>Chances are, if people are doing the all-meat diet,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not sprinkling,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not wrapping those steaks in seaweed</p>
<p>and they may or may not be supplementing with iodine.</p>
<p>Chances are they&rsquo;re probably consuming iodine salt,</p>
<p>but their requirements go up</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re not consuming vegetables.</p>
<p>People who are consuming vegetables,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of interesting,</p>
<p>we always hear that we should have</p>
<p>our cruciferous vegetables and those are so important,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re actually substances, compounds,</p>
<p>within high-quality cruciferous vegetables</p>
<p>that can interfere with thyroid hormone function.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re eating a lot of that stuff,</p>
<p>a lot of cabbages and just look up your other,</p>
<p>I think broccoli is a cruciferous vegetable</p>
<p>and I won&rsquo;t read off the whole list,</p>
<p>you could just put into the internet.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;re always told to eat</p>
<p>a lot of the dark leafy green stuff.</p>
<p>Well, unless that dark leafy green stuff is kelp or seaweed,</p>
<p>chances are that we&rsquo;re not getting enough iodine.</p>
<p>Unless we&rsquo;re adding salt to our food.</p>
<p>And chances are that we may be lowering</p>
<p>the total amount of thyroid that we&rsquo;re making,</p>
<p>as well as the fact that in plant-rich diets,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard to get enough L-tyrosine.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t want, you know,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not here to inflame any of the vegans</p>
<p>or the carnivore folks.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t take a stance either way on any of that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just learning, trying to report the science.</p>
<p>The point I want to make is your health is important.</p>
<p>So if you are purely plant-based</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re eating a lot of cruciferous vegetables,</p>
<p>make sure you&rsquo;re getting enough iodine.</p>
<p>It does seem like the cruciferous vegetables</p>
<p>can increase the need for further iodine.</p>
<p>And same thing if you&rsquo;re purely,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re on this all meat diet or you&rsquo;re keto</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re not ingesting many vegetables.</p>
<p>So I always thought that the cleaner the diet, the better,</p>
<p>but it turns and probably that&rsquo;s true</p>
<p>from the standpoint of, you know, hormone regulation,</p>
<p>you know, estrogen and testosterone and other hormones,</p>
<p>the highly processed foods really are terrible.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so much evidence for that.</p>
<p>The phthalates in plastics and the processed foods</p>
<p>and the emulsifiers,</p>
<p>all the stuff we talked about previous episode.</p>
<p>But it does seem to be that people</p>
<p>that are not getting enough iodine for whatever reason</p>
<p>really need to check out whether or not</p>
<p>their iodine levels need to be increased</p>
<p>because of the fact that they&rsquo;re consuming so many plants</p>
<p>or so many meats and in some cases,</p>
<p>plants that actually lower thyroid hormone.</p>
<p>And not to beat a dead horse or cabbage,</p>
<p>but there are a number of things that iodine can do</p>
<p>that are positive, that are sort of,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re related to thyroid, not directly.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re kind of offshoots of the thyroid pathway</p>
<p>on their downstream of it, we would say,</p>
<p>in terms of how they impact metabolic function.</p>
<p>One of those is to reduce something</p>
<p>called C-reactive protein.</p>
<p>Some of you may have heard of CRP or C-reactive protein.</p>
<p>C-reactive protein is something that you want to keep</p>
<p>at modestly low levels.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s associated with inflammation</p>
<p>and various forms of heart disease and even eye disease,</p>
<p>macular degeneration.</p>
<p>So it does appear that iodine supplementation</p>
<p>or getting sufficient iodine from food either works,</p>
<p>is associated with reduced levels of C-reactive protein</p>
<p>in the blood and an anti-inflammatory effect.</p>
<p>And the anti-inflammatory effect brings us back</p>
<p>to our old friend interleukin-6.</p>
<p>Remember, there are these inflammatory cytokines.</p>
<p>They have many, many names</p>
<p>because there are many, many of them.</p>
<p>Interleukin-10 is the one that&rsquo;s anti-inflammatory.</p>
<p>Interleukin-6 is the one that&rsquo;s inflammatory.</p>
<p>Anytime you see IL-6,</p>
<p>that usually means that there&rsquo;s an inflammatory response.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a wound, there&rsquo;s inflammation of the brain.</p>
<p>Somebody is either sleep deprived or had a brain injury</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;re dealing with some sort of infection.</p>
<p>IL-6 is kind of a catch-all for inflammation.</p>
<p>And it does appear that iodine supplementation</p>
<p>can reduce circulating IL-6</p>
<p>associated with inflammation.</p>
<p>So in that sense,</p>
<p>iodine can have an anti-inflammatory effect.</p>
<p>So by now it should be abundantly clear</p>
<p>if you care about thyroid hormone,</p>
<p>if you care about the pathways that it impacts,</p>
<p>like having a high level of metabolism,</p>
<p>which I guess if for no other reason is attractive</p>
<p>because then you can eat more</p>
<p>and still maintain a healthy body composition,</p>
<p>but also for brain health, cognitive function,</p>
<p>tissue repair, all that stuff,</p>
<p>keeping C-reactive protein low, keeping IL-6 low,</p>
<p>make sure you&rsquo;re getting enough iodine,</p>
<p>selenium, and L-tyrosine.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re curious how thyroid actually increases metabolism,</p>
<p>allows you to eat more, et cetera,</p>
<p>it relates to something we covered last issue,</p>
<p>which is glucose.</p>
<p>Remember when you eat something, blood sugar goes up,</p>
<p>insulin is secreted from the pancreas</p>
<p>and it makes sure that blood glucose doesn&rsquo;t go too high,</p>
<p>which can damage tissues or too low,</p>
<p>which can make you hypoglycemic.</p>
<p>Thyroid increases glucose uptake by various tissues,</p>
<p>in particular muscle and bone.</p>
<p>It actually can increase bone mineral density,</p>
<p>which is a really good thing as you get older.</p>
<p>Injuries, when I say older, I mean basically 30 and older.</p>
<p>The reason you can recover more quickly from injuries</p>
<p>if you have a healthy thyroid and healthy thyroid pathways</p>
<p>is because you can consume energy,</p>
<p>that energy is diverted toward bone repair</p>
<p>and muscle repair and cartilage repair.</p>
<p>And so the way it does this again is by increasing ATP,</p>
<p>but the whole idea here is that iodine, selenium,</p>
<p>l-tyrosine allow thyroid to be at healthy levels</p>
<p>so that thyroid then can take glucose in the blood</p>
<p>and divert it to tissues for it to be used,</p>
<p>in particular your brain.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why these things that we&rsquo;re talking about,</p>
<p>supplementing or getting from food</p>
<p>can actually improve or support brain function.</p>
<p>People are always asking me,</p>
<p>what is the food that I should eat for my brain?</p>
<p>Like, are blueberries good for your brain?</p>
<p>They do ask me, are walnuts good for your brain?</p>
<p>Because it looks like a brain.</p>
<p>We talked about that earlier.</p>
<p>The fact of the matter is that what you need</p>
<p>are nutrients that support hormones</p>
<p>and biological pathways that support the brain.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the way to think about it.</p>
<p>And I realized when people ask,</p>
<p>what should I eat to support my brain?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s basically what they&rsquo;re asking in short form.</p>
<p>So keeping your thyroid hormone healthy,</p>
<p>at healthy levels that is,</p>
<p>is going to be terrific for your brain</p>
<p>because 75% of your metabolism is from your brain.</p>
<p>The ability of your brain to use glucose</p>
<p>or ketones for that matter is going to be aided</p>
<p>by having healthy thyroid.</p>
<p>So do the things, take the things,</p>
<p>eat the things that are going to allow you</p>
<p>to have healthy levels of thyroid hormone.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure a number of you are out there wondering,</p>
<p>do I have healthy levels of thyroid hormone?</p>
<p>Those can be measured from the blood.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some telltale signs of having really high thyroid</p>
<p>or really low thyroid.</p>
<p>And I could start listing those off.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re easy to find online as well.</p>
<p>Things like bulging eyes, inability to maintain weight,</p>
<p>shaky, anxiety, that&rsquo;s kind of hyperthyroidal,</p>
<p>thinning of hair, this kind of thing.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to get into diagnosing hypothyroidism</p>
<p>and hyperthyroidism.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just impossible because you&rsquo;re there and I&rsquo;m here</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re kind of shouting back and forth</p>
<p>through a tunnel of video and comments.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re concerned about having excessively high</p>
<p>or excessively low levels of thyroid hormone,</p>
<p>absolutely look up what the symptoms are.</p>
<p>Talk to your physician.</p>
<p>And there are a number of good treatments.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t talk about prescription drugs</p>
<p>that can improve symptoms related to hypo or hyperthyroid.</p>
<p>Of course, they have synthesized thyroid.</p>
<p>So if you don&rsquo;t make enough thyroid, you can take thyroid.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s by prescription.</p>
<p>If you have too much thyroid,</p>
<p>sometimes they&rsquo;ll take out the thyroid gland</p>
<p>or they can administer drugs that will either block</p>
<p>receptors or will interfere with some of the pathways</p>
<p>from the brain to the pituitary</p>
<p>or from the pituitary to the thyroid</p>
<p>in order to adjust thyroid hormone that way.</p>
<p>So there are the big guns in terms of the treatments</p>
<p>for different thyroid disorders,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re not talking about thyroid disorders.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking about how to get and maintain thyroid levels</p>
<p>in healthy ranges and some straightforward ways to do that</p>
<p>through diet and supplementation.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also a lot of evidence</p>
<p>that for people who menstruate,</p>
<p>levels of thyroid hormone can fluctuate dramatically</p>
<p>across the menstrual cycle.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s really going to be a process of experimentation.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know that you could, in theory,</p>
<p>take blood at different phases of your cycle</p>
<p>and figure out whether or not your thyroid hormone</p>
<p>was excessively high or low at different phases of the cycle.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s going to be pretty tough to do.</p>
<p>If you have an endocrinologist</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s willing to do that with you, terrific.</p>
<p>I think most people are going to have to figure out</p>
<p>how supplementing the sorts of things</p>
<p>that we talked about before or getting them from foods</p>
<p>relates to different aspects of their cycle.</p>
<p>In general, the first half of the cycle before ovulation,</p>
<p>people crave carbohydrates and sweets more related to the,</p>
<p>and that makes total sense</p>
<p>based on the biology of the menstrual cycle.</p>
<p>Thyroid hormone is going to go up as you, as anyone,</p>
<p>male or female, menstruating or not,</p>
<p>increases more starchy carbohydrates.</p>
<p>This is interesting because ketogenic diets</p>
<p>have been shown to slightly lower thyroid levels.</p>
<p>And that makes sense because in ketogenic diets,</p>
<p>blood glucose levels are very low</p>
<p>and thyroid hormone is secreted in large part</p>
<p>in proportion to how much glucose is in the bloodstream</p>
<p>and how much that glucose, excuse me,</p>
<p>needs to be regulated.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not trying to demonize the ketogenic diet.</p>
<p>I think it definitely has its place.</p>
<p>There are 22 studies now</p>
<p>showing that it can dramatically reduce blood glucose.</p>
<p>And about a third of those show</p>
<p>that thyroid hormone levels are slightly reduced,</p>
<p>sometimes significantly, if not more,</p>
<p>in the ketogenic diet.</p>
<p>That may explain, I want to highlight may explain the fact</p>
<p>that when people go back to a more traditional diet,</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;ve been on a ketogenic diet for a long time,</p>
<p>that oftentimes they will gain weight very quickly</p>
<p>as they bring carbohydrates back into their diet.</p>
<p>Some people are cycling between ketogenic</p>
<p>and non-ketogenic every three, four days,</p>
<p>so-called cyclic ketogenic diet.</p>
<p>Some people are staying ketogenic for long periods of time.</p>
<p>Some people, six days on, one day off.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a huge variation there.</p>
<p>The point is that carbohydrates,</p>
<p>starchy carbohydrates in particular,</p>
<p>support the healthy production of T3 and T4.</p>
<p>And so if you&rsquo;re very low carbohydrate,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to have a reduction in T3 and T4.</p>
<p>And so if you&rsquo;re going to bring carbohydrates</p>
<p>back into your diet,</p>
<p>then you might want to do it more gradually.</p>
<p>And for those of you that menstruate</p>
<p>and are craving carbohydrates</p>
<p>in the early part of the cycle,</p>
<p>that is actually associated with having a healthy cycle.</p>
<p>If any of you have had a healthy cycle on a ketogenic diet,</p>
<p>that would be interesting.</p>
<p>Maybe let me know through the comments</p>
<p>or point me in the direction of some research</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re aware of it.</p>
<p>So as you can start to see,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s this really beautiful interplay</p>
<p>between the different hormones,</p>
<p>between insulin and glucose,</p>
<p>between estrogen and thyroid,</p>
<p>between thyroid and blood glucose and the ketogenic diets.</p>
<p>It all starts to fit together</p>
<p>in ways that make a lot of sense once you understand</p>
<p>the core elements of what the hormones are</p>
<p>and the variety of tissues that they work on.</p>
<p>The simple version of this is</p>
<p>if you haven&rsquo;t had a carbohydrate for a year,</p>
<p>then your T3, T4 levels are going to be pretty low.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s some ketonistas out there</p>
<p>that are going to say,</p>
<p>wait, no thyroid hormone levels go up with keto.</p>
<p>That might be true for other reasons,</p>
<p>indirect reasons related to hormone pathways</p>
<p>that cascade from being in ketosis</p>
<p>for long periods of time, great.</p>
<p>But for most people</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t consume any carbohydrate,</p>
<p>T3, T4 are going to go down.</p>
<p>And when they start to consume foods</p>
<p>that require thyroid metabolism</p>
<p>in order to work with, to metabolize,</p>
<p>then weight gain can sometimes happen more quickly.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s just something to consider</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s something to work with carefully</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re going to be cyclic ketogenic,</p>
<p>long-term ketogenic.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re not ketogenic</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re consuming carbohydrates</p>
<p>and the three things that we talked about earlier,</p>
<p>selenium, tyrosine, and iodine,</p>
<p>chances are, unless there&rsquo;s an underlying condition there,</p>
<p>that your levels of thyroid</p>
<p>are going to be in healthy range.</p>
<p>Next, we&rsquo;re going to talk about growth hormone.</p>
<p>Growth hormone has received a ton of attention</p>
<p>in the last 20 years.</p>
<p>I actually remember when it was first sequenced.</p>
<p>This was a huge deal.</p>
<p>There was a huge patent drama.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t mention the universities or the people involved.</p>
<p>There were companies and monster patents and payouts.</p>
<p>And it was really interesting.</p>
<p>You can look that up online</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re interested in some of the scientific history.</p>
<p>Growth hormone is a pretty straightforward one</p>
<p>for you to understand now</p>
<p>because it follows the exact same logic as thyroid hormone.</p>
<p>In fact, their functions are so closely overlapping</p>
<p>on the, you know, when we first look at the face of it</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re probably going to think,</p>
<p>why do you have these two systems?</p>
<p>So just very briefly, growth hormone releasing hormone.</p>
<p>So remember, releasing means it comes from the brain,</p>
<p>comes from the brain and tells the pituitary</p>
<p>to release growth hormone.</p>
<p>And then growth hormone is released into the bloodstream</p>
<p>where it goes and acts on a ton of tissues,</p>
<p>muscle, ligaments, bone, fat, et cetera,</p>
<p>to increase metabolism.</p>
<p>It sounds just like thyroid hormone</p>
<p>and they do work in parallel.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;ve lumped them together</p>
<p>in the same episode.</p>
<p>They increase metabolism and repair and growth of tissues.</p>
<p>A conversation about growth hormone would be incomplete</p>
<p>if we didn&rsquo;t talk about the kind of extremes.</p>
<p>There are certain people who are born</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t make enough growth hormone</p>
<p>and they end up very short in stature.</p>
<p>There are certain people who make a ton of growth hormone</p>
<p>and they end up very, very large.</p>
<p>They tend to have very large appendages.</p>
<p>They have something called acromegaly.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of like a ridging of the forehead.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually a bone ridge.</p>
<p>They are giant and it used to be called giantism.</p>
<p>And most people, of course, are in a range of height</p>
<p>and appendage length that doesn&rsquo;t imply</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a growth hormone disruption there.</p>
<p>Growth hormone received a lot of attention</p>
<p>after it was sequenced because that meant the opportunity</p>
<p>to inject growth hormone</p>
<p>and replace growth hormone that was lost.</p>
<p>And there was actually a lot of cases</p>
<p>of people taking their kids</p>
<p>and trying to get them to be taller for whatever reason</p>
<p>by injecting growth hormone.</p>
<p>Today, we&rsquo;re going to talk about the things</p>
<p>that anyone can do to increase growth hormone.</p>
<p>And there are reasons why certain people</p>
<p>would want to do that.</p>
<p>People who overproduce growth hormone</p>
<p>certainly would not want to do that.</p>
<p>People who underproduce it would probably want to do that.</p>
<p>People that make normal, quote unquote,</p>
<p>levels of growth hormone might want to do that as they age</p>
<p>because during puberty and development,</p>
<p>the pituitary is churning out tons of growth hormone.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s responsible for the growth, not surprising,</p>
<p>of the body and all its features,</p>
<p>height just being one of those.</p>
<p>And so as we age, we make less growth hormone.</p>
<p>And that is one of the reasons</p>
<p>why we recover more slowly from injuries.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of the reasons why we accumulate body fat.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s one of the reasons why our metabolism slows.</p>
<p>And so growth hormone replacement therapy</p>
<p>has been tremendously popular in the last 20 years,</p>
<p>which is not to say it doesn&rsquo;t carry its problems, it does.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s one of the major problems</p>
<p>with injecting growth hormone.</p>
<p>Not saying people shouldn&rsquo;t do this.</p>
<p>If the doctor has approved it</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s in keeping with their particular life goals,</p>
<p>but growth hormone, if it&rsquo;s in levels that are too high,</p>
<p>will cause growth of all tissues.</p>
<p>So not just muscle, not just reduction in body fat</p>
<p>by metabolizing, you know,</p>
<p>by allowing fatty acids to be pulled out of storage</p>
<p>and used for ATP,</p>
<p>but it will also cause increase in growth of the heart</p>
<p>and the lungs and the liver and the spleen.</p>
<p>And so this is the concern with abuse of growth hormone.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re not going to be talking</p>
<p>about abuse of growth hormone.</p>
<p>We will, however, talk about tools that anyone can use</p>
<p>to increase levels of growth hormone.</p>
<p>Some of them are behavioral,</p>
<p>some of them are supplement based,</p>
<p>and some of them interact with behaviors and supplements.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s cool about the discussion about growth hormone</p>
<p>is that the tools that exist out there</p>
<p>to increase growth hormone are very actionable.</p>
<p>Most people can do these</p>
<p>without the need for any equipment or even any supplement,</p>
<p>although there are some supplement related themes</p>
<p>for tools for growth hormone increase.</p>
<p>And also the increases that one can get</p>
<p>in growth hormone are substantial.</p>
<p>So normally when you talk about the difference</p>
<p>between taking something as an exogenous substance</p>
<p>like testosterone or estrogen</p>
<p>versus using supplements or behaviors to increase them,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re talking about tenfold differences</p>
<p>from, you know, administering the prescription compound.</p>
<p>In terms of growth hormone,</p>
<p>there are things that can increase growth hormone</p>
<p>three, four, 500% or more.</p>
<p>And even though that&rsquo;s a short-lived increase,</p>
<p>they can have very powerful effects on metabolism</p>
<p>and on repair of tissues.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about those.</p>
<p>Okay, let&rsquo;s go step-by-step</p>
<p>in terms of the things that anyone,</p>
<p>perhaps everyone should be doing</p>
<p>in order to maintain healthy growth hormone levels</p>
<p>or increase growth hormone levels.</p>
<p>Unless you have overproduction of growth hormone,</p>
<p>chances are these things are going to benefit you.</p>
<p>However, as always, I want to emphasize,</p>
<p>talk to a doctor before you do anything,</p>
<p>including remove any treatments.</p>
<p>So anything you would add or take away,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s responsibility of you and your healthcare provider.</p>
<p>Okay, I don&rsquo;t just say that to protect me,</p>
<p>I say that to protect you.</p>
<p>First of all, growth hormone is released every night</p>
<p>when you go to sleep.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s released in the early part of sleep</p>
<p>during so-called slow-wave sleep.</p>
<p>So the two conditions that have to be met</p>
<p>in order for growth hormone to be secreted regularly</p>
<p>for tissue repair, et cetera,</p>
<p>are you need to get into slow-wave sleep,</p>
<p>the so-called deep sleep,</p>
<p>and you need blood insulin and glucose to be relatively low.</p>
<p>So eating within two hours of sleep, excuse me,</p>
<p>eating within two hours of going to sleep</p>
<p>is going to suppress growth hormone release.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s very clear.</p>
<p>However, some people are going to have problems</p>
<p>falling asleep if they are too hungry.</p>
<p>So you have to work with that</p>
<p>and decide what you&rsquo;re going to eat</p>
<p>and when you&rsquo;re going to eat that thing</p>
<p>so that you&rsquo;re not so hungry</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re having trouble falling asleep.</p>
<p>The episodes on sleep that were covered</p>
<p>in episodes two, three, and four of the Huberman Lab Podcast</p>
<p>has, I believe, more tools there</p>
<p>than you could ever want or make use of</p>
<p>in terms of how to optimize sleep.</p>
<p>So you can refer to those if you like.</p>
<p>So don&rsquo;t eat too close to sleep</p>
<p>and then get into slow-wave sleep.</p>
<p>And as I talked about in one of those earlier episodes,</p>
<p>the first half of the night,</p>
<p>slow-wave sleep and deep sleep predominate.</p>
<p>The second half of the night, it&rsquo;s another kind of sleep.</p>
<p>We call REM sleep.</p>
<p>So what is special about this early phase of sleep?</p>
<p>This is how you should be thinking</p>
<p>if you listen to this podcast.</p>
<p>You should be thinking, okay,</p>
<p>I hear that something is important, it&rsquo;s related,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s in the pathway, but mechanistically,</p>
<p>when we say get into slow-wave sleep,</p>
<p>get into deep sleep,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when growth hormone is secreted.</p>
<p>The question you should be asking yourselves</p>
<p>as scientists of yourselves is, wait, why slow-wave sleep?</p>
<p>What in particular about slow-wave deep sleep</p>
<p>allows the pituitary to release growth hormone?</p>
<p>Like, what is it?</p>
<p>Because if you can understand that,</p>
<p>if you can understand a little bit of mechanism,</p>
<p>there are actually ways that you can increase the amount</p>
<p>of growth hormone that you release</p>
<p>both in sleep and out of sleep.</p>
<p>So the answer is, it&rsquo;s a delta wave activity in the brain.</p>
<p>Delta waves are these big giant waves of activity</p>
<p>in the brain that correlate with slow-wave sleep</p>
<p>as opposed to faster waves of activity</p>
<p>that associate with rapid eye movement sleep.</p>
<p>So slow-wave sleep and the delta activity</p>
<p>actually triggers the neurons in the brain,</p>
<p>the releasing hormone, right?</p>
<p>Growth hormone releasing hormone neurons</p>
<p>to signal to the pituitary.</p>
<p>Now, how do I know this is true?</p>
<p>And what can you do with this?</p>
<p>Well, we know this is true because researchers</p>
<p>have taken people in sleep deprived them</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ve just asked, well,</p>
<p>is it just one period of time every 24 hours?</p>
<p>And then the pituitary releases growth hormone.</p>
<p>If that were the case,</p>
<p>that would say that growth hormone is just released</p>
<p>in a so-called circadian dependent way.</p>
<p>Every 24 hours, there&rsquo;s the pulse of it.</p>
<p>But no, it&rsquo;s always relating to slow-wave deep sleep</p>
<p>and delta waves.</p>
<p>And this is cool because what it means is that</p>
<p>even if you&rsquo;re not measuring your brainwaves during sleep,</p>
<p>which most of you probably are not,</p>
<p>you might be measuring slow-wave sleep or deep sleep</p>
<p>using a device like a whoop or an aura.</p>
<p>And even if you&rsquo;re not,</p>
<p>what this means is that during the day,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s the potential to also increase</p>
<p>growth hormone release if you can get the brain</p>
<p>into the so-called delta waves.</p>
<p>And it turns out there are things you can do in waking</p>
<p>as well to increase growth hormone release.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re going to talk about those next,</p>
<p>but as a tool and to just really make sure</p>
<p>that we put brackets around this,</p>
<p>try and have blood glucose not too high.</p>
<p>So if you do need to eat close to bed,</p>
<p>you wouldn&rsquo;t want to eat anything</p>
<p>that would increase blood glucose too much.</p>
<p>Try and not eat too close to bedtime.</p>
<p>Get into deep sleep early in the night,</p>
<p>get the growth hormone release,</p>
<p>and understand that it&rsquo;s the delta waves of activity,</p>
<p>these sweeping big waves of activity in the neurons</p>
<p>that stimulate the brain to stimulate the pituitary.</p>
<p>Because once you understand that,</p>
<p>then you have something to anchor to in terms of thinking,</p>
<p>what are the things I can do in waking</p>
<p>that will allow me to release more growth hormone,</p>
<p>which for most people is going to be a good thing.</p>
<p>Several times before on this podcast,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked about the fact that I&rsquo;m not a big fan</p>
<p>of melatonin supplementation for most purposes.</p>
<p>It might be helpful under conditions of jet lag.</p>
<p>However, there are a lot of reasons</p>
<p>why I personally don&rsquo;t like melatonin.</p>
<p>It interacts with the reproductive hormones,</p>
<p>testosterone and estrogen,</p>
<p>and that whole axis in ways that are unattractive,</p>
<p>at least to me, it suppresses puberty during development.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s present in much, much higher doses in most supplements</p>
<p>than one would normally make, like 100-fold, 300-fold.</p>
<p>However, today I&rsquo;m going to talk about an instance</p>
<p>where very low levels of melatonin supplementation</p>
<p>might actually be advantageous.</p>
<p>And that is aiding the transition</p>
<p>to the delta wave, slow wave sleep I just described,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s the pattern of sleep</p>
<p>and brainwave activity that triggers growth hormone release.</p>
<p>So whereas most melatonin supplements</p>
<p>are one milligram, three milligrams, 12 milligrams,</p>
<p>this kind of thing, that is supraphysiological.</p>
<p>There are some data showing that microgram,</p>
<p>maybe 500 micrograms of melatonin, so half a milligram,</p>
<p>can be beneficial in shifting the pattern</p>
<p>of early night sleep</p>
<p>toward more of the slow wave deep sleep delta activity</p>
<p>and improving growth hormone release.</p>
<p>Not a lot of studies, but the ones that I saw are quality.</p>
<p>They were done in subjects that, you know,</p>
<p>both sexes, sufficient numbers, et cetera.</p>
<p>So this is interesting.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re interested in melatonin supplementation,</p>
<p>you might think about it just at very low levels,</p>
<p>you know, hundreds of micrograms</p>
<p>as opposed to the milligram dosages.</p>
<p>Most of the ones out there</p>
<p>are going to be in milligram dosages.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s one way that some studies have shown</p>
<p>that you can increase the amount of growth hormone</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s secreted in early phases of sleep.</p>
<p>Now, the delta wave activity</p>
<p>and the slow wave activity in the brain</p>
<p>being very important for growth hormone release</p>
<p>and growth hormone release being so important</p>
<p>for metabolic functions and peeling away unwanted body fat</p>
<p>and repairing tissues, et cetera,</p>
<p>forces us to ask, well, what other things can we do</p>
<p>in waking in order to increase growth hormone release?</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s start with the ones that have</p>
<p>a potentially big effect,</p>
<p>but are a little bit harder to access.</p>
<p>And for that, I want to point toward a book,</p>
<p>which is really kind of interesting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not focused on growth hormone,</p>
<p>but the book is called Altered Traits.</p>
<p>This is the book.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an excellent book.</p>
<p>Altered Traits by Goldman and Davidson,</p>
<p>Science Reveals How Meditation Changes</p>
<p>Your Mind, Brain and Body.</p>
<p>Very interesting book.</p>
<p>For those of you that are interested in meditation</p>
<p>and perhaps those of you who are not,</p>
<p>but are considering it,</p>
<p>what they talk about in this book is the fact</p>
<p>that meditation has two separate lines of effects.</p>
<p>One of those lines of effects</p>
<p>are things that change your state.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re stressed, you sit down, you meditate</p>
<p>and you relax and you go into a particular state.</p>
<p>The other are the changes that occur over time</p>
<p>and those are changes in trait.</p>
<p>So personality can actually change</p>
<p>with long bouts of TM meditation or repeated meditation.</p>
<p>In any case, the reason we&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about altered traits today is because certain types</p>
<p>of meditation can get people&rsquo;s brains into states</p>
<p>that very closely mimic slow wave sleep.</p>
<p>If you hear snoring in the background,</p>
<p>Costello sounds like he&rsquo;s in slow wave sleep.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s big oscillatory snores that he&rsquo;s in 23.6 hours per day.</p>
<p>So what this means is for people that are interested</p>
<p>in increasing growth hormone, a meditation practice</p>
<p>that allows you to get into these slow wave</p>
<p>delta type frequency activity in the brain</p>
<p>may be very beneficial because as I mentioned before,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s gating growth hormone release.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just a circadian phenomenon,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s actually controlled by these brainwaves.</p>
<p>I did look up binaural beats.</p>
<p>I get so many questions about binaural beats</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a really attractive idea, right?</p>
<p>Binaural beats, for those of you who don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>you listen to one frequency of tone in one ear</p>
<p>and another frequency of tone in the other ear.</p>
<p>And then the brain essentially takes the average of the two</p>
<p>or there&rsquo;s some other wiring in the brainstem</p>
<p>that makes it not quite the average,</p>
<p>but takes the average of the two for sake of discussion.</p>
<p>And that frequency is what the brain entrains</p>
<p>or maps onto.</p>
<p>There are a lot of apps that are claiming</p>
<p>that you can get the brain into delta waves</p>
<p>using binaural beats.</p>
<p>I could not find quality peer review studies supporting that,</p>
<p>but I know there are a lot of fans out there</p>
<p>of binaural beats.</p>
<p>If you know of any literature that&rsquo;s independent</p>
<p>of the company that makes the binaural beat technology,</p>
<p>so Unbiased Research, please send it my way.</p>
<p>But in Altered Traits, Goldman and Davidson talk about</p>
<p>the fact that people who do 20 minutes</p>
<p>of sitting meditation per day</p>
<p>can access these slow wave sleep-like brain states.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;ve talked a lot on here about non-sleep deep rest,</p>
<p>things like yoga nidra and hypnosis.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not aware that those will put people</p>
<p>into slow wave sleep per se or delta waves per se.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re really talking about 20 minutes</p>
<p>of more traditional type meditation.</p>
<p>Okay, so we talked about very low doses of melatonin</p>
<p>as a way to trigger delta waves</p>
<p>and more growth hormone release in sleep.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s science to support that.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve now talked about a waking behavior of 20 minutes</p>
<p>of sort of what I would call standard meditation</p>
<p>or just sitting there concentrating on one&rsquo;s breathing</p>
<p>to try and access delta waves.</p>
<p>Binaural beats, no science yet.</p>
<p>Who knows, maybe there&rsquo;s science to support it.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re aware of it, let me know.</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s move to the things that one can do</p>
<p>that have been shown to have, let&rsquo;s just be honest,</p>
<p>pretty enormous effects on growth hormone release</p>
<p>in waking and these are things that are very actionable.</p>
<p>One of the things that can have a dramatic effect</p>
<p>on levels of growth hormone release in waking</p>
<p>as well as in sleep the following night is exercise.</p>
<p>But the key is the type of exercise and the duration.</p>
<p>Now there&rsquo;s a logic to this.</p>
<p>There are hundreds if not thousands of studies</p>
<p>measuring growth hormone both during</p>
<p>or sometimes after exercise or the following night.</p>
<p>And the conclusion that one takes away from all of these</p>
<p>is that exercise has to be of particular duration</p>
<p>and intensity in order to get growth hormone release.</p>
<p>So first I&rsquo;m just going to tell you what I found</p>
<p>to be the maximum amount of growth hormone release</p>
<p>as it relates to a particular form of exercise.</p>
<p>The particular form of exercise is either weight training</p>
<p>or it can be endurance training,</p>
<p>but the endurance training and the weight training</p>
<p>actually have to be limited to about 60 minutes,</p>
<p>not much longer.</p>
<p>Now this is important because it&rsquo;s been shown</p>
<p>over and over again that if one exercises too long</p>
<p>with weights or endurance exercise,</p>
<p>that cortisol levels go high enough</p>
<p>that it starts to inhibit the testosterone</p>
<p>and even the estrogen pathways.</p>
<p>This is why I believe people who overexercise</p>
<p>or exercise a lot can lose their menstrual cycles,</p>
<p>they stop menstruating.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s why you get suppressions in testosterone</p>
<p>if people train too long and too hard.</p>
<p>The cutoff has always been, you know,</p>
<p>60 to 75 minutes of the hard work part.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to vary a lot from person to person.</p>
<p>But in terms of growth hormone,</p>
<p>the conditions that seem to lead</p>
<p>to the greatest growth hormone release</p>
<p>are one, get warm.</p>
<p>This is interesting.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to talk about temperature.</p>
<p>So a proper warmup seems to accelerate</p>
<p>the release of growth hormone</p>
<p>once the hard work phase starts.</p>
<p>So 10 minutes of warmup or so</p>
<p>was the number that I extracted from all these studies.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a beautiful review on this, by the way.</p>
<p>Growth hormone responses of varying, excuse me,</p>
<p>growth hormone, arginine and exercise.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll talk about arginine in a few minutes.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s by Canaley, K-A-N-A-L-E-Y.</p>
<p>It was published in Current Opinion</p>
<p>in Clinical Nutrition and Metabolic Clare.</p>
<p>The Current Opinion journals</p>
<p>are generally of pretty high quality</p>
<p>in terms of the reviews,</p>
<p>just because they tend to be pretty recent.</p>
<p>And then the references therein are also quite good.</p>
<p>So what does this mean?</p>
<p>This means warmup.</p>
<p>And when you say warmup,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t mean just warm up the limbs and tissues</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re going to use so you don&rsquo;t get injured,</p>
<p>actually warm the body.</p>
<p>So there was actually some discussion</p>
<p>about whether or not in cold winter months,</p>
<p>people should wear like a stocking cap,</p>
<p>bringing the conditions, making the room warm.</p>
<p>So getting the body warm as a warmup seems to be important</p>
<p>because temperature of the body</p>
<p>seems to be an important condition</p>
<p>or prerequisite for certain patterns of exercise</p>
<p>to maximize growth hormone release.</p>
<p>So this is really interesting to me.</p>
<p>I have an obsession</p>
<p>with how body temperature, light exercise and food interact.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going right there with the fact that if you get warm,</p>
<p>you bring up the body temperature degree or two</p>
<p>or maybe three and then start exercise.</p>
<p>It does appear that high intensity exercise,</p>
<p>but again, as discussed in a previous episode,</p>
<p>not exercise that brings muscles to failure,</p>
<p>but close to it.</p>
<p>So if it&rsquo;s weight bearing exercise,</p>
<p>it would be getting close to that final repetitions</p>
<p>where you can&rsquo;t complete them,</p>
<p>but not pushing through those</p>
<p>or even going to failure, but getting close</p>
<p>leads to anywhere from 300 to 500% increases</p>
<p>in resting growth hormone levels</p>
<p>and 300 to 500% increases in growth hormone</p>
<p>the following night when you go to sleep,</p>
<p>which is incredible.</p>
<p>Now, I want to dissect this properly, okay?</p>
<p>So one of the other conditions that seemed to be important</p>
<p>again was to have relatively low blood glucose.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s looking a lot like the conditions you need for sleep</p>
<p>in order to get maximum growth hormone release in sleep.</p>
<p>So not having blood glucose too high or too low,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a discussion unto itself.</p>
<p>You want to have sufficient energy to do the exercise,</p>
<p>but getting warm,</p>
<p>not having blood glucose too high or too low,</p>
<p>so probably not eating too close to exercise</p>
<p>or not ingesting a lot of sugars during the exercise.</p>
<p>That was supported by the fact</p>
<p>that ingestion of a sports drink</p>
<p>that contains caloric sugar</p>
<p>immediately flatlined the growth hormone levels.</p>
<p>So really interesting relationship</p>
<p>between insulin, glucose, and growth hormone.</p>
<p>So then doing the training</p>
<p>for anywhere from 60 to 75 minutes</p>
<p>to maximize growth hormone release.</p>
<p>And then the other interesting thing</p>
<p>was that even after the exercise,</p>
<p>taking body temperature back down to normal levels</p>
<p>relatively quickly seemed to be associated</p>
<p>with these big spikes in growth hormone.</p>
<p>Otherwise, what would happen</p>
<p>is you get these big spikes in growth hormone,</p>
<p>but if the exercise went too long</p>
<p>or if body temperature remained too high for too long,</p>
<p>then you didn&rsquo;t get the second increase</p>
<p>in growth hormone the following night, okay?</p>
<p>So I hope I made that abundantly clear.</p>
<p>Warm up well, get body temperature up,</p>
<p>exercise 60 to 75 minutes.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t go to absolute failure</p>
<p>if your interest is in growth hormone release,</p>
<p>both during the exercise and later that night.</p>
<p>And if you can bring body temperature back down</p>
<p>to normal levels by cooling off,</p>
<p>maybe cool shower or maybe ice pack or something,</p>
<p>or maybe just turning off the heat in the room</p>
<p>or going outside, whatever it is,</p>
<p>then you increase the probability</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re going to increase growth hormone</p>
<p>the following night as well.</p>
<p>And again, these are big increases, 300 to 500%.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like you&rsquo;re getting</p>
<p>a second sleep during the day.</p>
<p>But if the exercise is too hard,</p>
<p>if body temperature stays too high for too long,</p>
<p>you disrupt the whole process</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t get the effect of increased growth hormone.</p>
<p>Growth hormone is really powerful,</p>
<p>but it doesn&rsquo;t work alone.</p>
<p>In fact, a lot of the effects of growth hormone</p>
<p>are mediated by its effects on the liver.</p>
<p>So growth hormone is released, goes to the liver,</p>
<p>and then the liver releases something called IGF-1,</p>
<p>insulin growth factor one.</p>
<p>Insulin growth factor one was popular</p>
<p>in the neuroscience community as an area of focus</p>
<p>because of its ability to trigger improvements</p>
<p>in memory and learning after exercise.</p>
<p>And indeed, exercise triggers both the release</p>
<p>of growth hormone and IGF-1.</p>
<p>IGF-1 seems responsible for a lot of the effects</p>
<p>of improved memory.</p>
<p>Some people report that that is due</p>
<p>to increased number of neurons or neurogenesis,</p>
<p>birth of new neurons.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty clear that in humans,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not what&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>Yes, in animals, not in humans.</p>
<p>IGF-1 nonetheless has positive effects</p>
<p>on memory and cognition.</p>
<p>And a great way to trigger IGF-1 release</p>
<p>and growth hormone release is through exercise.</p>
<p>Now, the interesting thing,</p>
<p>and the reason I&rsquo;m bringing up IGF-1 here</p>
<p>is that certain patterns of exercise,</p>
<p>actually duration of exercise,</p>
<p>have different effects on IGF-1 and growth hormone,</p>
<p>depending on whether or not the exercise</p>
<p>is done by men or women.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s what we call a sex-dependent effect.</p>
<p>And the sex-dependent effect is as follows.</p>
<p>In this particular study and several others,</p>
<p>what they did is they had people exercise.</p>
<p>They measured growth hormone and IGF-1 levels</p>
<p>from the blood before, during, and after exercise.</p>
<p>And they could see when the greatest increases occurred.</p>
<p>This was standard sorts of resistance exercise.</p>
<p>So some squats, there was a sprint-like activity.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t really matter what the specific exercises were.</p>
<p>None of them were to failure.</p>
<p>These were in kind of the 10 repetition or less range,</p>
<p>six sets, so kind of standard weight training stuff</p>
<p>that anyone might do.</p>
<p>But what was interesting is that women were able to access</p>
<p>the biggest peak in growth hormone and IGF-1</p>
<p>early in the exercise, so in the first 30 minutes.</p>
<p>So what this means is even if you just have 30 minutes,</p>
<p>at least for women, there&rsquo;s going to be a big increase</p>
<p>in growth hormone and IGF-1 in the first 30 minutes.</p>
<p>For men, the biggest increase occurred later</p>
<p>in the exercise, which was 60 minutes or so total.</p>
<p>And so the sex-dependent effects are interesting.</p>
<p>They point to the fact that things like cortisol,</p>
<p>testosterone, and estrogen, which of course vary</p>
<p>in different levels in men and women,</p>
<p>are going to impact the release of things like IGF-1</p>
<p>and growth hormone.</p>
<p>And yes, they did control for all sorts of things</p>
<p>like diet and they controlled for weight</p>
<p>and prior experience.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually a quite nice study.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to check it out,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s by Pierce et al.,</p>
<p>Growth Hormone Insulin Glow Factor 1 Molecular Weight</p>
<p>Isoform Response to Resistance Exercise</p>
<p>are sex-dependent in frontiers in endocrinology,</p>
<p>fine journal in 2020, so it&rsquo;s quite recent.</p>
<p>So what does this mean?</p>
<p>This means if you&rsquo;re exercising</p>
<p>and you want growth hormone release, warm up,</p>
<p>do the type of exercise we&rsquo;ve been discussing.</p>
<p>Women in the first 30 minutes is when you&rsquo;re going to get</p>
<p>the maximum benefit in terms of growth hormone and IGF-1.</p>
<p>Men, you have to keep going for the entire 60 minutes,</p>
<p>so don&rsquo;t tap out early if you&rsquo;re interested</p>
<p>in getting the growth hormone and IGF-1 release.</p>
<p>And the same conditions apply about then cooling down</p>
<p>and not making the exercise last so long</p>
<p>that you don&rsquo;t get the increasing growth hormone</p>
<p>the following night.</p>
<p>My experience thus far in doing this podcast</p>
<p>is that people fall into one of two categories.</p>
<p>There are the just tell me what to take people,</p>
<p>the people that are really eager to try supplements</p>
<p>and maybe even prescription compounds.</p>
<p>And then there are people who are a little bit more shy</p>
<p>about supplementation.</p>
<p>They are more focused on what they can do with diet</p>
<p>and behaviors and things of that sort.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have a bias either way.</p>
<p>I try and offer tools that are supported</p>
<p>by the scientific literature.</p>
<p>And I always point to safety margins.</p>
<p>There are supplements that can increase growth hormone</p>
<p>to a considerable degree.</p>
<p>And no, these aren&rsquo;t growth hormone itself,</p>
<p>although that of course will increase growth hormone</p>
<p>to a considerable degree.</p>
<p>We will talk about prescription drugs at the end,</p>
<p>not just growth hormone,</p>
<p>but some other things that are quite prominently</p>
<p>in use right now,</p>
<p>in particular in the entertainment industry.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty interesting compounds.</p>
<p>But first let&rsquo;s talk about supplements.</p>
<p>So this has been known about for some time,</p>
<p>but arginine, the amino acid arginine,</p>
<p>as well as the amino acid ornithine</p>
<p>can increase growth hormone levels substantially.</p>
<p>Now, arginine has a number of effects.</p>
<p>You can get it from food.</p>
<p>You can get it from supplements.</p>
<p>Some people take it in pill form or capsule form.</p>
<p>Some people will actually take it by IV intravenously.</p>
<p>The levels and the amounts of arginine required</p>
<p>to get big growth hormone release increases</p>
<p>is pretty substantial.</p>
<p>So some people will take arginine before bedtime.</p>
<p>Some people will take it before exercise.</p>
<p>Prerequisite again is low blood glucose.</p>
<p>Blood glucose is high.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to quash the effect.</p>
<p>The amounts of arginine that people take</p>
<p>are anywhere from three grams to 10 grams</p>
<p>or sometimes even more.</p>
<p>Although this is definitely a case of more is not better.</p>
<p>There is a threshold at which growth hormone release</p>
<p>is actually blunted by taking more than nine grams</p>
<p>of arginine.</p>
<p>Now, nine grams of arginine orally is a lot of pills.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s at minimum nine pills</p>
<p>and it can cause some GI disturbance, right?</p>
<p>People can feel nauseous.</p>
<p>Some people will throw it up.</p>
<p>Some people get some constipation or diarrhea, et cetera,</p>
<p>or just stomach aches.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m certainly not suggesting people do this.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not that they take arginine,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s the reason why most of the studies</p>
<p>that looked at the role of arginine</p>
<p>on growth hormone levels did it by IV, intravenous infusion.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s interesting, however,</p>
<p>is that whether or not it&rsquo;s by mouth or by vein,</p>
<p>taking arginine can dramatically increase</p>
<p>growth hormone release.</p>
<p>And the levels or the amount of increase</p>
<p>was anywhere from 100 on the low end,</p>
<p>but anywhere from basically from 400 to 600%</p>
<p>above baselines.</p>
<p>These are huge increases in growth hormone.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;ve never tried arginine.</p>
<p>Arginine is out there for a number of different purposes.</p>
<p>One of them is to increase growth hormone.</p>
<p>As some of the supplements out there</p>
<p>to increase growth hormone include arginine and ornithine.</p>
<p>Arginine does have the effect of dilating arterioles</p>
<p>and it basically increases blood supply.</p>
<p>The arginine pathway is involved in vasodilation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually the pathway that&rsquo;s downstream</p>
<p>of a lot of drugs that are used</p>
<p>to treat things like erectile dysfunction.</p>
<p>And anytime people have problems</p>
<p>with peripheral blood flow of any kind,</p>
<p>they focus on compounds that will either disrupt the enzymes</p>
<p>or will adjust the levels of amino acids</p>
<p>to get more vasodilation.</p>
<p>So taking arginine for the purpose</p>
<p>of increasing growth hormone will also have the effect</p>
<p>of dilating blood vessels.</p>
<p>And for people with heart conditions</p>
<p>that actually can be a serious issue.</p>
<p>Now, here is something really important</p>
<p>and interesting to note,</p>
<p>which is that increasing arginine levels</p>
<p>with the specific goal of increasing growth hormone release</p>
<p>can actually short circuit the effects</p>
<p>of exercise on growth hormone.</p>
<p>Several studies I looked at,</p>
<p>looked at the interaction of taking arginine</p>
<p>and the exercise or just the arginine</p>
<p>or just the exercise alone.</p>
<p>And so you don&rsquo;t, unfortunately,</p>
<p>if growth hormone increases your goal,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t unfortunately get to increase growth hormone 800%</p>
<p>by taking arginine and exercising.</p>
<p>It always seems to be clamped</p>
<p>at about 300 to 500% increases, still large increases.</p>
<p>So I make that point for several reasons.</p>
<p>First of all, be aware that arginine</p>
<p>has these other effects on vasodilation.</p>
<p>Take those seriously if you have a heart condition</p>
<p>or take them seriously in any case.</p>
<p>Second of all, you can supplement with arginine,</p>
<p>not exercise and get these big increases in growth hormone</p>
<p>by taking them before sleep.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re taking the arginine before exercise,</p>
<p>you are going to short circuit</p>
<p>or clamp the effects of exercise on growth hormone, okay?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s something that one could use,</p>
<p>but it doesn&rsquo;t have a synergistic effect with exercise.</p>
<p>The two more or less cancel each other out, not to zero,</p>
<p>but you end up with the same effect you would</p>
<p>had you done one or the other.</p>
<p>So hopefully that&rsquo;s clear.</p>
<p>The other thing is if one&rsquo;s goal</p>
<p>is really to increase arginine in the blood</p>
<p>for whatever reason,</p>
<p>arginine may not actually be the best way to do that</p>
<p>because of the way it&rsquo;s metabolized in the gut.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t have access or get access to the tissues</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re most interested in</p>
<p>in terms of increasing growth hormone</p>
<p>or vasodilation for that matter.</p>
<p>And in that case,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something else called L-citrulline</p>
<p>which has powerful effects on vasodilation,</p>
<p>powerful effects potentially on growth hormone levels</p>
<p>via the arginine pathway.</p>
<p>But basically L-citrulline acts as sort of a donor</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s kind of a biological prerequisite for arginine</p>
<p>and can lead to even bigger arginine increases</p>
<p>than you would get if you took arginine itself.</p>
<p>And so L-citrulline is out there</p>
<p>but keep in mind that anything that dilates the blood vessels</p>
<p>will lower blood pressure.</p>
<p>So L-citrulline, yes, will lead to increased blood flow</p>
<p>for whatever purpose you want to use it for,</p>
<p>whether or not that&rsquo;s pumps in the gym or whatever.</p>
<p>It also can lead to big increases</p>
<p>in arginine and growth hormone,</p>
<p>but it will lower blood pressure.</p>
<p>So be aware of that</p>
<p>but and understand that the biology</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t so straightforward.</p>
<p>L-citrulline may actually be the better way</p>
<p>to get arginine increases than arginine itself.</p>
<p>And ornithine can also increase growth hormone,</p>
<p>although that&rsquo;s also through an indirect pathway.</p>
<p>And nowadays there isn&rsquo;t a lot of focus on ornithine</p>
<p>as a way to increase growth hormone.</p>
<p>That was kind of all the rage in the 90s,</p>
<p>not so much anymore.</p>
<p>Nowadays, the people who are really in the know</p>
<p>for this stuff tend to focus on L-citrulline.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re interested in L-citrulline or arginine,</p>
<p>I highly recommend you go to our old friend,</p>
<p>good friends, examine.com</p>
<p>because there you can put it into the list.</p>
<p>You can just put search and it&rsquo;s totally free.</p>
<p>And it will tell you</p>
<p>that blood pressure will be slightly decreased.</p>
<p>Power output in the gym will increase.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s very strong effects on blood glucose.</p>
<p>Fatigue is reduced notably.</p>
<p>Big increases in nitric oxide.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s also related to the increase in vasodilation.</p>
<p>Plasma arginine, very high effect, excuse me,</p>
<p>notable effects, very high support for studies</p>
<p>which allow people more training volume,</p>
<p>aerobic exercise, arterial stiffness is brought down.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a huge list of things.</p>
<p>Increase in growth hormone.</p>
<p>So two studies showing this was done double blind.</p>
<p>Great, you always want to see double blind,</p>
<p>placebo controlled.</p>
<p>This was only done in males, not in females.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, just have data from males,</p>
<p>but increases in growth hormone.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a small, but a real significant effect.</p>
<p>And again, from quality studies.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a huge number of effects there.</p>
<p>And some of the other kind of more interesting ones</p>
<p>about L-citrulline that you might not have thought about</p>
<p>are things like muscle oxygenation.</p>
<p>As we scroll down, decreases in C-reactive protein.</p>
<p>So a lot of the same things that you might expect,</p>
<p>excuse me, from the same sorts of compounds we saw before.</p>
<p>The takeaway here is if you want to increase growth hormone,</p>
<p>think about the arginine pathway,</p>
<p>but arginine itself might not be the best direct route</p>
<p>to get there.</p>
<p>L-citrulline might be a better option,</p>
<p>but please do consider and take very seriously</p>
<p>the effects on blood pressure.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve been talking about big effects</p>
<p>from supplementation or exercise on growth hormone,</p>
<p>this extremely powerful hormone.</p>
<p>And one thing to note is that the profile of growth hormone</p>
<p>as we age changes.</p>
<p>I mentioned that earlier,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s important to understand how it changes.</p>
<p>One thing that&rsquo;s particularly interesting to me</p>
<p>as somebody who&rsquo;s in his 40s</p>
<p>is that it&rsquo;s actually between ages 30 and 40</p>
<p>that the amount of growth hormone that you release</p>
<p>each night is reduced by two to threefold.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really incredible.</p>
<p>You know, we hear so much about testosterone levels</p>
<p>going down as we age or estrogen levels going down.</p>
<p>But if you recall from the testosterone and estrogen episode</p>
<p>talked about the fact that if you really look at the data,</p>
<p>just for instance, on testosterone,</p>
<p>there are men in their 90s and they are not rare,</p>
<p>it turns out, that are making as much testosterone</p>
<p>and DHT, dihydrotestosterone, as they were in their 20s.</p>
<p>Okay, so we hear so much nowadays</p>
<p>about how testosterone levels are dropping,</p>
<p>sperm levels are dropping, et cetera.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t dispute that.</p>
<p>I talked about that in that episode.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s clear that testosterone levels</p>
<p>vary tremendously from person to person.</p>
<p>And just getting older does not necessarily mean</p>
<p>that testosterone levels are dropping.</p>
<p>Growth hormone levels, it seems,</p>
<p>are dropping when people are in their 30s and 40s</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re dropping substantially.</p>
<p>And that seems to be the case across the board.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just not going to find people in their 40s, 50s,</p>
<p>and 60s that are making as much growth hormone</p>
<p>as they were in their teens and 20s.</p>
<p>And as somebody who, I feel really good,</p>
<p>but as somebody who definitely noticed</p>
<p>that as I got into my 40s,</p>
<p>that even if I slept the same amount,</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t feeling quite as, I would say,</p>
<p>able to recover from exercise or wound healing,</p>
<p>even with the same amount of sleep.</p>
<p>And I was trying to optimize a great number of things.</p>
<p>This business of growth hormone</p>
<p>became a particular interest to me.</p>
<p>And since the ways to manipulate growth hormone</p>
<p>in men and in women are so straightforward,</p>
<p>and since everybody goes through this age-related decline</p>
<p>very dramatically, it seems to me that the things</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re supposed to be doing anyway, like exercising,</p>
<p>like trying not to eat too close to bedtime,</p>
<p>trying to optimize sleep,</p>
<p>all of these are wonderful tools</p>
<p>that we should be pursuing and perhaps using.</p>
<p>And they can actually offset</p>
<p>the two to three-fold decrease, right?</p>
<p>If we&rsquo;re talking about a two to three-fold decrease</p>
<p>for people that are in their 30s and 40s,</p>
<p>and then we&rsquo;re talking about increases from exercise</p>
<p>or from maybe from supplementation,</p>
<p>but certainly from exercise of 300 to 500%,</p>
<p>well, then all of a sudden we&rsquo;re in a position</p>
<p>to actually offset the age-related decline</p>
<p>in growth hormone completely just through behaviors.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s quite interesting and quite powerful.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;d like to discuss a way</p>
<p>that anyone can increase their levels</p>
<p>of growth hormone dramatically.</p>
<p>And when I say dramatically, I mean dramatically.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll get to the numbers in a couple minutes,</p>
<p>but we have to remember how growth hormone</p>
<p>is released in the first place.</p>
<p>Remember, it all starts in the brain, in the hypothalamus.</p>
<p>The hypothalamus is a brain area</p>
<p>that controls things like sexual behavior,</p>
<p>temperature regulation, circadian behavior,</p>
<p>meaning when you want to be awake</p>
<p>and when you want to be asleep, aggression, all of that.</p>
<p>There are other brain areas involved too,</p>
<p>but it has a rich collection of different neurons</p>
<p>involved in all these very basic functions.</p>
<p>Now, as we talked about the releasing hormones,</p>
<p>the growth hormone releasing hormone</p>
<p>comes from neurons in the hypothalamus.</p>
<p>Those then communicate with the pituitary</p>
<p>and the pituitary releases growth hormone.</p>
<p>And then the growth hormone acts</p>
<p>on all these different tissues,</p>
<p>muscle, liver, cartilage, et cetera, body fat.</p>
<p>Makes them use energy.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why you lose body fat</p>
<p>when growth hormone levels are high.</p>
<p>It makes you grow muscle, strengthens bones, et cetera.</p>
<p>Now, one of the things that has a profound effect</p>
<p>on growth hormone levels,</p>
<p>growth hormone release is temperature.</p>
<p>Now, the data on this are very strong</p>
<p>and the data come from both animal studies</p>
<p>and human studies.</p>
<p>So there are a number of studies that have explored</p>
<p>how making animals cold or hot can increase growth hormone.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re guessing which direction this is going to go,</p>
<p>you can probably imagine that making animals</p>
<p>or people warmer is the way to go</p>
<p>if you want to increase growth hormone.</p>
<p>Now, anytime you&rsquo;re going to increase temperature</p>
<p>of yourself or anyone else or an animal, it is risky.</p>
<p>I want to be really clear about this.</p>
<p>Not everyone should engage in the behaviors</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m about to describe.</p>
<p>But, and I should just say the reason it&rsquo;s risky</p>
<p>is it doesn&rsquo;t take much of a temperature increase</p>
<p>in the brain to cook the brain, to cook neurons.</p>
<p>And after that point, neurons can&rsquo;t come back</p>
<p>and people can die from hyperthermia.</p>
<p>We have a much greater range in terms of cold.</p>
<p>You can also die of hypothermia.</p>
<p>You can freeze to death,</p>
<p>but you have a much greater range of getting cold</p>
<p>than you do warming up the brain.</p>
<p>However, there are really strong data</p>
<p>pointing to the fact that sauna,</p>
<p>aka deliberate hyperthermia, not too high, however,</p>
<p>that sauna can increase the release of growth hormone</p>
<p>and other hormones.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s so dramatic about this literature</p>
<p>is the size of the effects that are reported.</p>
<p>So first of all, let&rsquo;s talk about</p>
<p>these temperature increases.</p>
<p>And yes, I will refer to things that people can do</p>
<p>even if you don&rsquo;t own a sauna,</p>
<p>because I realize not everybody has a sauna</p>
<p>in their backyard or has access to a sauna.</p>
<p>So first of all, recall our study about exercise,</p>
<p>where warming up a few degrees before the exercise</p>
<p>led to bigger and quicker increases in growth hormone</p>
<p>during the exercise bout itself.</p>
<p>So that already point in the direction</p>
<p>that temperature was important.</p>
<p>Now, the degrees, no pun intended,</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re talking about increasing body temperature</p>
<p>is by entering saunas that are somewhere</p>
<p>between 176 degrees Fahrenheit,</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s 80 degrees Celsius,</p>
<p>and all the way up to like 210, 215 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
<p>I personally know people that go even higher than that,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;ve trained themselves to deal</p>
<p>with very high heats.</p>
<p>And again, high heat is dangerous.</p>
<p>You must clear this with your doctor.</p>
<p>Now, what happens in high heat?</p>
<p>A couple of things happen in high heat.</p>
<p>First of all, you start getting bigger stroke volume</p>
<p>of the heart, kind of like an exercise.</p>
<p>Once you get well-trained in endurance activity,</p>
<p>your stroke volume, the amount of blood</p>
<p>that your heart can pump each time gets larger.</p>
<p>You dilate the blood vessels, right?</p>
<p>There are a lot of things that happen also.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re sweating, your body&rsquo;s trying to unload heat.</p>
<p>Dilation of blood vessels, arginine increases in heat.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re starting to see and hear a common theme,</p>
<p>but it appears that getting into,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying getting the body up to 212 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
<p>I want to be very clear.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not talking about getting the body</p>
<p>up to 100 degrees Celsius.</p>
<p>That would be terrible.</p>
<p>You would die.</p>
<p>But entering environments where it&rsquo;s very hot</p>
<p>for short periods of time,</p>
<p>anywhere from 20 minutes to 30 minutes,</p>
<p>where the temperature is 80 degrees Celsius</p>
<p>to 100 degrees Celsius, or 175 degrees Fahrenheit,</p>
<p>more or less, to about 210 degrees Fahrenheit, more or less,</p>
<p>has been shown to increase growth hormone release 16-fold.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right, 16-fold.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s 1,600%.</p>
<p>Now, there are also effects on other hormones,</p>
<p>prolactin, cortisol, et cetera.</p>
<p>So the pattern that was described in this study,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;ve been many studies now,</p>
<p>endocrine effects of repeated sauna were done in 17 humans.</p>
<p>This was from doing this repeatedly.</p>
<p>So it wasn&rsquo;t the first time they did this.</p>
<p>They actually had to do this three days in a row.</p>
<p>And the pattern was to get into the sauna for 20 minutes,</p>
<p>followed by a 30-minute cooling period.</p>
<p>Remember, you don&rsquo;t want to spend long periods of time</p>
<p>at high heat.</p>
<p>You can cook your brain and other tissues.</p>
<p>Be very careful as you approach this if you decide to.</p>
<p>But 30 minutes, excuse me, 20-minute sauna,</p>
<p>followed by 30 minutes of cooling,</p>
<p>followed by 20-minute sauna again,</p>
<p>led to a five-fold increase in growth hormone.</p>
<p>And then by doing that day after day after day,</p>
<p>on the third day, you would see these huge increases</p>
<p>of like 16-fold, up to 16-fold.</p>
<p>And there are now many studies like this.</p>
<p>This was described a few years ago.</p>
<p>But since then, there have been a number of other studies</p>
<p>that have pointed in the direction of</p>
<p>deliberate hyperthermia, but not too hot,</p>
<p>that you kill yourself in order to increase growth hormone.</p>
<p>And I know I keep highlighting the dangers there,</p>
<p>but again, anytime you&rsquo;re going to mess with heat,</p>
<p>you have to be cautious.</p>
<p>You have to be careful.</p>
<p>So standard sauna can be useful.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t have access to a sauna,</p>
<p>one way that people do this,</p>
<p>we have to look to our friends, the wrestlers, right?</p>
<p>They wear plastics, which are basically body suits</p>
<p>that are fairly inexpensive that you can buy</p>
<p>on any online purchase platform, I should say.</p>
<p>Some people in the old days,</p>
<p>before they had these plastics things so readily available,</p>
<p>I actually knew people that wrapped themselves</p>
<p>in garbage bags and then throw on sweats and a hoodie</p>
<p>and then go out for a jog.</p>
<p>Again, you have to be really careful,</p>
<p>especially on a hot day, overheating can equate to death.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s another way to heat up.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t actually need a sauna.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve known people who will do this in hotel rooms</p>
<p>while they&rsquo;re traveling.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll turn on the heat, make a hot bath.</p>
<p>They won&rsquo;t actually get in the bath,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;ll fill the room with steam and heat</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll put on a hoodie and some sweatshirt, sweatpants,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll sit there with wool socks on</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll get warm for 20 minutes.</p>
<p>Then they&rsquo;ll take a cool shower and then they&rsquo;ll do it again.</p>
<p>I guess when the hotel&rsquo;s paying the water bill,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t worry about it too much.</p>
<p>Some people, of course, own saunas.</p>
<p>There are a lot of ways to do that.</p>
<p>I have friends who were in the military</p>
<p>who made saunas out of cars while they were overseas,</p>
<p>all sorts of things.</p>
<p>You do have to be careful.</p>
<p>I know I&rsquo;ve said it many, many times.</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t want anyone to hurt themselves.</p>
<p>But these increases in growth hormone are tremendous.</p>
<p>And what they probably stem from</p>
<p>are increased activity of neurons within the hypothalamus</p>
<p>that stimulate growth hormone release from the pituitary.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s probably because the growth hormone</p>
<p>releasing hormone neurons in the hypothalamus</p>
<p>sit very closely and may even be intermixed</p>
<p>with some of the neurons in the hypothalamus</p>
<p>that regulate heat and body temperature.</p>
<p>Remember, metabolism is in part a heat.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a furnace of how much energy</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re consuming and using for building</p>
<p>or for energy usage purposes.</p>
<p>So sauna can be very, very interesting.</p>
<p>And again, it&rsquo;s 20 minutes, 30 minute cooling,</p>
<p>20 minutes again, proceed with extreme caution.</p>
<p>But nonetheless, these are pretty extreme effects</p>
<p>in terms of their abilities</p>
<p>to increase growth hormone levels.</p>
<p>Along the lines of temperature and hormones,</p>
<p>I just want to mention a very recent study just came out,</p>
<p>March, April, 2021.</p>
<p>Endocrine effects of repeated hot thermal stress</p>
<p>and cold water immersion in young adult men.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it was just in men.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t look at women, but nonetheless,</p>
<p>I think the data are relevant to everybody</p>
<p>as a general theme.</p>
<p>This is Podstowski et al.</p>
<p>I will put a link to the study in the caption.</p>
<p>And they looked at testosterone, prolactin, cortisol,</p>
<p>et cetera, and what they found was that the sauna</p>
<p>does indeed lead to a significant decrease in cortisol,</p>
<p>a stress hormone, a hormone that you want to be released</p>
<p>early in the day when you wake up.</p>
<p>But sauna definitely led to a significant decrease</p>
<p>in cortisol, but did not change testosterone,</p>
<p>DHEA, or prolactin levels.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>And it turns out that the cold did affect</p>
<p>some of these hormones, but the results there</p>
<p>were a little bit more mixed.</p>
<p>So the takeaway here is that heat seems to have</p>
<p>positive effects on growth hormone, big effects.</p>
<p>It seems to have positive effects</p>
<p>on reducing cortisol levels.</p>
<p>And it does not seem to have effects on things</p>
<p>like testosterone, DHEA, or prolactin directly.</p>
<p>You can imagine that a shift in any hormone</p>
<p>is going to alter the levels of other hormones</p>
<p>down the line, sort of indirect effects.</p>
<p>But in terms of direct effects, just during</p>
<p>or immediately after the sauna bath, there were no effects.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve talked about diet, supplementation,</p>
<p>behavioral tools, and of course, we talked about</p>
<p>the underlying biology and logic.</p>
<p>And hopefully you heard the safety precautions</p>
<p>for all of those.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;d like to just briefly talk about</p>
<p>the prescription side of all this.</p>
<p>There are, as we know, many people taking growth hormone</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s been prescribed to them by a doctor.</p>
<p>And presumably there are people taking growth hormone</p>
<p>even though it has not been prescribed by a doctor,</p>
<p>which is none of my business.</p>
<p>But the point here is that most all of the hormones</p>
<p>that we make have been synthesized.</p>
<p>So there are versions of them in little bottles</p>
<p>or little ampules that people can inject.</p>
<p>Here are a couple of important things to consider.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re going to go that route.</p>
<p>First of all, talk to a physician, right?</p>
<p>They actually are only legally available</p>
<p>through a physician.</p>
<p>Second of all, anytime you&rsquo;re injecting something,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to shut down your own production.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the way that the hormone system works.</p>
<p>If you take thyroid hormone, you won&rsquo;t make thyroid hormone,</p>
<p>at least in the long run.</p>
<p>If you take testosterone, you will shut down</p>
<p>your own production of testosterone.</p>
<p>If you take estrogen, the system&rsquo;s a little more resilient,</p>
<p>but eventually you will shut down</p>
<p>your production of estrogen.</p>
<p>And the same is true for growth hormone.</p>
<p>So a decision to go that route of taking something</p>
<p>is often not always a decision to do it forever.</p>
<p>However, if you&rsquo;re willing to sustain a period</p>
<p>of being without a given hormone,</p>
<p>some people can do things and then stop taking them</p>
<p>and then wait out the period in which they&rsquo;re not making</p>
<p>testosterone, estrogen, or growth hormone,</p>
<p>and then it will come back.</p>
<p>Sometimes, and sometimes it won&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a kind of new area that&rsquo;s developing now</p>
<p>that I think deserves our attention,</p>
<p>not because I&rsquo;m encouraging it, but because it is happening.</p>
<p>And in keeping with the science and in keeping with trying</p>
<p>to keep things modern, it&rsquo;s worth us discussing.</p>
<p>And those are peptides.</p>
<p>So these days you hear a lot about peptides.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to clarify a little bit about what peptides are.</p>
<p>Peptides is a really huge category of biological compounds.</p>
<p>Peptides are just strings of amino acids, right?</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve talked about l-tyrosine, arginine, ornithine.</p>
<p>Those are amino acids.</p>
<p>Those are individual amino acids.</p>
<p>And those are put together into little small peptides</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;re what are called polypeptides,</p>
<p>which are just longer peptides.</p>
<p>Turns out that for any substance like growth hormone</p>
<p>or growth hormone releasing hormone,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s made up of different amino acids in different sequences</p>
<p>just like your genes are made up of A&rsquo;s and G&rsquo;s</p>
<p>and C&rsquo;s and T&rsquo;s, nucleotides in different sequences.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a recipe.</p>
<p>Peptides tend to be short sequences of amino acids</p>
<p>that resemble a hormone enough</p>
<p>or resemble some other peptide enough that it can lead</p>
<p>to the similar or same effects when you inject them.</p>
<p>So for example, we make growth hormone releasing hormone</p>
<p>from our brain, which stimulates growth hormone</p>
<p>from the pituitary.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re probably getting tired of me saying that by now.</p>
<p>But people now will take things like sermorelin,</p>
<p>S-E-R-M-O-R-E-L-I-N, sermorelin,</p>
<p>which is not the entire peptide sequence</p>
<p>of growth hormone releasing hormone,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a subset of those.</p>
<p>And when people inject it before they go to sleep at night,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s typically how it&rsquo;s done on an empty stomach,</p>
<p>then that stimulates the release of growth hormone</p>
<p>from the pituitary.</p>
<p>So this is not taking growth hormone.</p>
<p>This is taking the stimulating hormone</p>
<p>or what&rsquo;s often called a secretagogue or a mimic.</p>
<p>All right, it causes a secretion</p>
<p>of the hormone that one wants.</p>
<p>People will do this for thyroid hormone too.</p>
<p>Some people are doing this by prescription</p>
<p>with a real medical need.</p>
<p>Other people are doing it for just longevity reasons,</p>
<p>which kind of falls into that gray zone</p>
<p>of they wouldn&rsquo;t die without it,</p>
<p>but they want to enhance their life.</p>
<p>And so they&rsquo;re doing that</p>
<p>because they believe it&rsquo;s the right thing for them.</p>
<p>Prescription, sermorelin is prescription.</p>
<p>Do they work?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Do they shut down your natural production</p>
<p>of growth hormone releasing hormone?</p>
<p>Well, the answer is yes,</p>
<p>but some of these peptides actually have the effect</p>
<p>of changing gene expression.</p>
<p>Remember way back to the beginning</p>
<p>when I was talking about hormones,</p>
<p>they can actually change gene expression</p>
<p>and they can actually set pathways in motion</p>
<p>for continued production of a hormone,</p>
<p>even if you stop taking the compound.</p>
<p>Now that can be good or that can be bad</p>
<p>because as you recall,</p>
<p>big increases in growth hormone that are short-lived</p>
<p>like sauna, or I should say exercise,</p>
<p>or arginine, or sauna,</p>
<p>it seems like has these huge effects,</p>
<p>or early nights, first phase of sleep early in the night,</p>
<p>these sorts of things.</p>
<p>Those are transient,</p>
<p>but when one is injecting over and over a constant level,</p>
<p>you can put into action gene expression programs</p>
<p>that can be long-lived.</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s say you have a particular tumor in the body,</p>
<p>tumors will grow when they see growth hormone,</p>
<p>even if that tumor is unhealthy for you, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got growth of tissues all over the body.</p>
<p>So again, I&rsquo;m not saying whether or not</p>
<p>people should do these things or not doing them.</p>
<p>One thing I do know is that they are in very prominent use</p>
<p>in the movie industry,</p>
<p>people who want to peel off body fat quickly,</p>
<p>they do increase recovery time,</p>
<p>they increase healing rates.</p>
<p>People are also injecting things like gastric peptides.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re actually stomach peptides</p>
<p>that we talked about in the previous episode.</p>
<p>Things related to the ghrelin pathway</p>
<p>and other things from the liver</p>
<p>that can improve the rate of tissue and wound healing.</p>
<p>You can bet that in the upcoming Olympics,</p>
<p>a lot of people are using peptides and compounds</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m not pointing fingers at anyone in particular.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, this is separate from hormone augmentation</p>
<p>of like injecting GH or injecting testosterone.</p>
<p>People are now working further up the pathways.</p>
<p>Other names of some of the peptides</p>
<p>are things like ipermoralin, tesamoralin.</p>
<p>Some of these have clinical uses.</p>
<p>Others have just been made as compounds for people</p>
<p>in the kind of longevity field</p>
<p>or the self-augmentation field, if you will.</p>
<p>So again, not promoting their use,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re definitely out there.</p>
<p>And so now if you hear about them</p>
<p>or someone&rsquo;s talking to you about them,</p>
<p>now hopefully you have a better understanding</p>
<p>about their underlying biology</p>
<p>and you can think rationally about whether or not</p>
<p>they are the right decision for you.</p>
<p>Okay, once again, covered an enormous amount of material.</p>
<p>Hopefully now you understand thyroid hormone</p>
<p>and what it does and a little bit about its mechanism</p>
<p>or maybe a lot and growth hormone and what it does</p>
<p>and how both of them take care of our metabolism.</p>
<p>They dictate how many nutrients we can eat and make use of.</p>
<p>They can pull from body fat stores,</p>
<p>repair muscle, repair cartilage.</p>
<p>They really are incredible compounds</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re actionable.</p>
<p>There are things that we can do</p>
<p>like getting that early phase of sleep,</p>
<p>perhaps supplementing with arginine, maybe not.</p>
<p>Hopefully getting adequate exercise, warming up properly,</p>
<p>not making the exercise too long or too intense will help.</p>
<p>Maybe sauna or things like it,</p>
<p>deliberate safe hyperthermia, the emphasis on safe,</p>
<p>might be things that are of use.</p>
<p>Regardless, even if you&rsquo;re not interested in the thyroid</p>
<p>or the growth hormone pathways,</p>
<p>this brings to a close our month on hormones.</p>
<p>And so now hopefully you understand</p>
<p>not just thyroid and growth hormone,</p>
<p>but the logic that underlies thyroid hormone,</p>
<p>growth hormone, estrogen, testosterone,</p>
<p>why we eat, why we stop eating,</p>
<p>cholecystokinin, ghrelin.</p>
<p>If these names don&rsquo;t mean anything to you,</p>
<p>then perhaps go back and listen to those episodes.</p>
<p>But regardless, I hope that you come away from this</p>
<p>with a deeper understanding about these hormones,</p>
<p>which are so powerful in controlling</p>
<p>the way our brain functions</p>
<p>and the interplay between the brain and hormones,</p>
<p>because it is really a bi-directional conversation.</p>
<p>The brain is telling the body what hormones to make,</p>
<p>the hormones are influencing all the tissues of the body,</p>
<p>but also telling the brain whether or not to eat more</p>
<p>or grow more or think more, et cetera.</p>
