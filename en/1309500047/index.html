<p>syrian and today is monday</p>
<p>which means it&rsquo;s murder mystery and makeup monday</p>
<p>if you are new here hi how are you my name is bailey</p>
<p>syrian and every</p>
<p>monday i sit down and talk about true crime</p>
<p>story that&rsquo;s been heavy on my</p>
<p>noggin and i do my makeup</p>
<p>at the same time i just kind of get</p>
<p>ready for my day</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re interested in true</p>
<p>crime and you like makeup i</p>
<p>would highly suggest you hit that subscribe button</p>
<p>this story has been</p>
<p>recommended to me so many times to the</p>
<p>point i was like okay you guys win</p>
<p>i didn&rsquo;t wanna do it but you guys kept asking</p>
<p>i didn&rsquo;t know what to do i caved i gave in</p>
<p>alright gertrude van</p>
<p>fawson have you heard of her</p>
<p>gertrude okay</p>
<p>she was born september 19th 1925</p>
<p>no i&rsquo;m sorry 1929 and she was the</p>
<p>third of six children</p>
<p>she was born in indiana and honestly not much is known</p>
<p>about her childhood</p>
<p>except that her family was like working class</p>
<p>she loved her her father</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s said that she was indifferent towards her</p>
<p>mother and then at age age</p>
<p>eleven she actually witnessed</p>
<p>her dad dying</p>
<p>he had a massive heart attack and</p>
<p>attack and died this is a personal opinion</p>
<p>i believe that she had to have a fucked up</p>
<p>childhood for the things that she does</p>
<p>later on in this</p>
<p>story there&rsquo;s no way that she had a</p>
<p>quote unquote like pretty normal</p>
<p>childhood no there&rsquo;s no way i nope just</p>
<p>throwing that out there</p>
<p>so at age 16</p>
<p>gertrude she</p>
<p>dropped out of high</p>
<p>school and she married</p>
<p>a man named john banasuski</p>
<p>so he was actually two years</p>
<p>older than her and he was from pennsylvania and then he</p>
<p>would become a</p>
<p>later on a police officer</p>
<p>and the two of them john and gertrude</p>
<p>ended up having four children</p>
<p>paula stephanie</p>
<p>john and marie</p>
<p>sadly though the home was pretty damn toxic</p>
<p>john was pretty abusive</p>
<p>towards gertrude and he would like take his</p>
<p>anger out on her he</p>
<p>would beat her pretty</p>
<p>often in front of</p>
<p>the children and then</p>
<p>after ten years of</p>
<p>marriage gertrude finally</p>
<p>took the kids</p>
<p>and she was able</p>
<p>to to leave to get out</p>
<p>and then gertrude</p>
<p>quickly got married</p>
<p>again to another man and his name was edward</p>
<p>has anyone noticed there&rsquo;s always a lot of</p>
<p>edwards in these stories</p>
<p>anyways so she&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>she married this</p>
<p>edward guy that</p>
<p>marriage only lasted</p>
<p>three months</p>
<p>so okay so when she got a divorce from this</p>
<p>edward guy gertrude actually goes back to her</p>
<p>first husband john</p>
<p>and she remarries him</p>
<p>when they got remarried</p>
<p>gertrude and john had two more children together</p>
<p>shirley and james</p>
<p>and then they got divorced for the</p>
<p>second time not long</p>
<p>after gertrude</p>
<p>started dating another man</p>
<p>and his name was dennis lee</p>
<p>right and dennis was 22 years old</p>
<p>gertrude was like yeah getting it and then</p>
<p>unfortunately gertrude got pregnant by this 22 year old</p>
<p>and shortly</p>
<p>after that not shortly</p>
<p>nine months</p>
<p>nine months</p>
<p>after that she gave</p>
<p>birth to the</p>
<p>child and as soon as she gave birth</p>
<p>dennis he was like</p>
<p>peace out bye</p>
<p>so then she filed</p>
<p>a paternity</p>
<p>suit and requested that dennis</p>
<p>help pay for this</p>
<p>child and you know that</p>
<p>never goes well</p>
<p>for some fucking reason</p>
<p>the court sided</p>
<p>with gertrude but dennis</p>
<p>never paid anything nothing</p>
<p>changed so by the</p>
<p>age of 37 gertrude was a single</p>
<p>mother of seven</p>
<p>children she had been divorced</p>
<p>three times yeah</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s just she&rsquo;s not feeling</p>
<p>too good i guess</p>
<p>about herself and</p>
<p>where she&rsquo;s at</p>
<p>in life gertrude was five foot six and she only weighed</p>
<p>about 100 pounds</p>
<p>and she smoked constantly and she had really bad asthma</p>
<p>and she heavily</p>
<p>relied on child support</p>
<p>from john to pay her</p>
<p>bills and take care of her children</p>
<p>so now we move on to somebody else who is</p>
<p>like a different person</p>
<p>story but they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>still involved her name is</p>
<p>sylvia lichens and she was born january 3rd 1949</p>
<p>her parents</p>
<p>they worked in a carnival</p>
<p>actually they were considered more</p>
<p>like lower class they</p>
<p>were kind of struggling to pay the bills and whatnot</p>
<p>the lichens family had five children so they had daniel</p>
<p>diana they were fraternal twins</p>
<p>sylvia and jenny</p>
<p>and then benny</p>
<p>so jenny and benny</p>
<p>fraternal twins and then</p>
<p>sylvia was like the only one who wasn&rsquo;t a twin jenny</p>
<p>who is sylvia&rsquo;s</p>
<p>younger sister she</p>
<p>had polio she had gotten polio as a</p>
<p>child and she suffered a limp</p>
<p>so she had to wear like a leg brent brace and</p>
<p>sylvia was really overprotective of her younger</p>
<p>sister so as a</p>
<p>teenager sylvia</p>
<p>would also just kind of work odd jobs</p>
<p>ones that you can as a</p>
<p>teenager like babysitting</p>
<p>and then she</p>
<p>would give that</p>
<p>money to her</p>
<p>parents just to kind of help them out so on july 3rd</p>
<p>sylvia&rsquo;s mom was</p>
<p>arrested because she was caught shoplifting and they</p>
<p>ended up putting her in jail this</p>
<p>caused some stress to the</p>
<p>lichens family</p>
<p>it was just mainly</p>
<p>cause they couldn&rsquo;t work like</p>
<p>they needed the money</p>
<p>why did she do that</p>
<p>when she went to prison it just put</p>
<p>their dad in a really hard spot</p>
<p>he couldn&rsquo;t really take care of all the kids</p>
<p>so their father</p>
<p>tried to find</p>
<p>boarding for the two girls so that they</p>
<p>could return to the carnival</p>
<p>circuit and continue making</p>
<p>money so the</p>
<p>oldest lichen</p>
<p>daughter was</p>
<p>married so she</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t able</p>
<p>to go on the carnival circuit with them and help out</p>
<p>she just was living her own life and then they had</p>
<p>to boys who</p>
<p>would also join them or</p>
<p>their dad to make</p>
<p>extra money on the carnival circuit</p>
<p>dad didn&rsquo;t think that the carnival</p>
<p>would be saved for the youngest</p>
<p>daughters and he wanted them to stay in</p>
<p>indiana and not go with them so that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>why he was looking for somewhere for them to stay</p>
<p>okay so while in</p>
<p>school sylvia</p>
<p>meets gertrude&rsquo;s</p>
<p>daughter stephanie</p>
<p>and they meet in high</p>
<p>school and they kind of become just friends</p>
<p>she invited</p>
<p>sylvia over for like a</p>
<p>sleepover when</p>
<p>sylvia&rsquo;s dad</p>
<p>would go to pick up</p>
<p>sylvia from the</p>
<p>house he began to</p>
<p>speak with stephanie&rsquo;s mom</p>
<p>gertrude he was talking to her</p>
<p>about you know they&rsquo;re trying to find somewhere that</p>
<p>sylvia can go just like venting to her i</p>
<p>guess gertrude was like hey why doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>sylvia just stay here</p>
<p>and just pay me 20</p>
<p>a week and honestly it</p>
<p>sounded great</p>
<p>for sylvia&rsquo;s dad i mean</p>
<p>sylvia wouldn&rsquo;t have to change</p>
<p>schools and she would</p>
<p>be with people that she&rsquo;s familiar with so it just</p>
<p>sounded like a really good idea</p>
<p>and also it seemed like gertrude had a little bit of a</p>
<p>crush on sylvia&rsquo;s dad</p>
<p>and was just</p>
<p>kind of saying that to please him or something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just an observation i have no idea so both</p>
<p>sylvia and her</p>
<p>sister jenny</p>
<p>would be staying with gertrude and her</p>
<p>tribe of children</p>
<p>at first everything was</p>
<p>going great i mean</p>
<p>sylvia and jenny helped with the house</p>
<p>hold chores and they were</p>
<p>treated fairly</p>
<p>in the house</p>
<p>they would even</p>
<p>attend sunday</p>
<p>school service</p>
<p>but as time went on</p>
<p>things just kind of</p>
<p>started going</p>
<p>south because</p>
<p>because sylvia&rsquo;s father</p>
<p>the twenty dollars a week remember</p>
<p>that they agreed on it just like wasn&rsquo;t showing up the</p>
<p>twenty dollars and this was kind of pissing gertrude</p>
<p>off like hey i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>watching your kids</p>
<p>you promised</p>
<p>twenty dollars a week</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not happening</p>
<p>so this is just making gertrude more and more</p>
<p>angry because like</p>
<p>where&rsquo;s her</p>
<p>twenty dollars</p>
<p>bitch she then</p>
<p>started to just take her</p>
<p>anger out on</p>
<p>the kids so in one of the first</p>
<p>disciplinary actions gertrude</p>
<p>beat the lichen</p>
<p>sisters with a</p>
<p>quarter inch paddle saying</p>
<p>quote well i took care of you</p>
<p>two little bitches</p>
<p>for a week for nothing end</p>
<p>quote and then there was another occasion</p>
<p>where the two</p>
<p>sisters got beat</p>
<p>or at least hit 15 times it said</p>
<p>by the paddle for eating too much at church dinner</p>
<p>so this gertrude lady&rsquo;s a real bitch</p>
<p>for some strange reason most of the anchor kind of</p>
<p>or the abuse</p>
<p>centered on</p>
<p>sylvia paula</p>
<p>the oldest of gertrude&rsquo;s children</p>
<p>was jealous</p>
<p>of sylvia&rsquo;s appearance</p>
<p>she thought</p>
<p>sylvia was really good looking and really pretty</p>
<p>and like why wasn&rsquo;t she pretty</p>
<p>so she would also pick on</p>
<p>sylvia as well</p>
<p>so not only</p>
<p>is sylvia getting beat by this</p>
<p>awful gertrude</p>
<p>lady kids are also being really mean to her as well</p>
<p>so one day sylvia had come home from</p>
<p>school and she was talking</p>
<p>to her sister</p>
<p>about how she had a boyfriend at</p>
<p>school and this made the</p>
<p>oldest child</p>
<p>annoyed or angry so</p>
<p>she decided to kick her in the</p>
<p>lower region</p>
<p>and accused her of being pregnant</p>
<p>and on another occasion gertrude</p>
<p>would beat sylvia for stealing</p>
<p>candy when in reality</p>
<p>she purchased it</p>
<p>but most of all gertrude</p>
<p>would deny sylvia food</p>
<p>sylvia would be left to like</p>
<p>eat out of the garbage cans</p>
<p>so sylvia decided to collect the recycling items</p>
<p>inside the house but also just like out in</p>
<p>different garbage can areas</p>
<p>so that she can turn it in and get</p>
<p>money for it</p>
<p>of course gertrude</p>
<p>caught her doing that and then</p>
<p>punished her</p>
<p>pretty heavily</p>
<p>for that on another occasion</p>
<p>sylvia was forced</p>
<p>free a hot dog</p>
<p>covered with like a</p>
<p>bunch of condiments</p>
<p>and when she</p>
<p>threw the hot dog back up she was made</p>
<p>to then eat it</p>
<p>again sylvia was</p>
<p>falsely accused of</p>
<p>spreading rumors</p>
<p>about the two oldest kids</p>
<p>holla and stephanie at</p>
<p>school i don&rsquo;t know but like why</p>
<p>this was happening</p>
<p>i guess like</p>
<p>stephanie or even paula</p>
<p>would like come home</p>
<p>and then tell gertrude oh yeah this is what</p>
<p>sylvia did today</p>
<p>uh huh like i just don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>understand that the two kids were like oh yeah</p>
<p>sylvia&rsquo;s talking</p>
<p>about how were</p>
<p>sluts and when gertrude finds this out she was livid</p>
<p>so stephanie</p>
<p>tells her boyfriend his name is coy</p>
<p>and she tells him like oh yeah</p>
<p>so sylvia called me a prostitute</p>
<p>so then her boyfriend stephanie&rsquo;s boyfriend coy</p>
<p>then went and beat up sylvia</p>
<p>more people are in on this</p>
<p>stephanie and paula the oldest kids they</p>
<p>would actually take turns</p>
<p>with gertrude attacking</p>
<p>sylvia like it just</p>
<p>absolutely makes no</p>
<p>sense what kind of fucked up</p>
<p>sorry so like one time paula beat</p>
<p>sylvia to the</p>
<p>point that she</p>
<p>broke her own wrist</p>
<p>and then once paula</p>
<p>got her cast on from</p>
<p>breaking her wrist</p>
<p>she then used that cast</p>
<p>to beat the shit out of</p>
<p>sylvia some more</p>
<p>but this time with the cast</p>
<p>what the hell</p>
<p>kind of sick this was just like a continuing</p>
<p>cycle like it just didn&rsquo;t seem like it was gonna stop</p>
<p>anytime soon the</p>
<p>older sisters as well as</p>
<p>their friends</p>
<p>would tell their</p>
<p>classmates that</p>
<p>sylvia was spreading</p>
<p>nasty rumors</p>
<p>about them and</p>
<p>their families and i</p>
<p>think in order to deflect any of some</p>
<p>sylvia&rsquo;s claims</p>
<p>about the abuse</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not even sure anymore because then they</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t fight</p>
<p>classmates over</p>
<p>they would invite friends over and just</p>
<p>beat up or even sexually</p>
<p>abuse sylvia</p>
<p>they even said it was</p>
<p>sylvia&rsquo;s best friend</p>
<p>her name was anna at</p>
<p>school they told</p>
<p>anna that sylvia had been talking crap</p>
<p>behind her back</p>
<p>so then they invited</p>
<p>anna to come over to the</p>
<p>house and beat up sylvia</p>
<p>while the family</p>
<p>watched when i was reading this i seriously</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t think this was real</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s real</p>
<p>the kids would just invite</p>
<p>their friends over they</p>
<p>would practice karate</p>
<p>on sophia they</p>
<p>would kick her they</p>
<p>would beat her poor</p>
<p>sylvia her skin was covered in</p>
<p>cigarette burns because they</p>
<p>would put cigarettes out on her skin</p>
<p>yeah sylvia was made to</p>
<p>strip down in</p>
<p>front of the family and the neighborhood kids</p>
<p>and they inserted</p>
<p>things into her</p>
<p>lower area just</p>
<p>sexually abusing her and it&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>awful eventually</p>
<p>gertrude forbid</p>
<p>sylvia from</p>
<p>going to school</p>
<p>after sylvia</p>
<p>admitted that she stole a</p>
<p>tracksuit from</p>
<p>school and she</p>
<p>stole it because she needed it for</p>
<p>school and gertrude refused to buy it for her so she</p>
<p>ended up stealing it gertrude</p>
<p>found it and then just beat the crap out of her like</p>
<p>this girl this poor girl</p>
<p>so sylvia and jenny</p>
<p>were terrified to tell anybody</p>
<p>about what was</p>
<p>going on at the</p>
<p>house they thought that it</p>
<p>would only make the abuse</p>
<p>worse and gertrude told them if you tell anybody i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna kill you</p>
<p>they believed this so they didn&rsquo;t want to say anything</p>
<p>so the kids</p>
<p>ended up telling nobody what was</p>
<p>going on which</p>
<p>i know as people you and i sitting here</p>
<p>listening to this</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>hard to believe that they didn&rsquo;t tell anybody like why</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t you tell anybody</p>
<p>but we also don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>their thought process</p>
<p>we weren&rsquo;t experiencing what they were experiencing</p>
<p>so the lichens family they</p>
<p>would come back and they would</p>
<p>visit from time to time</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t notice anything weird</p>
<p>about the kids</p>
<p>which is so</p>
<p>strange to me but they didn&rsquo;t during the time of them</p>
<p>visiting nothing</p>
<p>would happen</p>
<p>the girls wouldn&rsquo;t tell the family and</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t suspect that anything was happening as well</p>
<p>which is strange me</p>
<p>cause i feel like you</p>
<p>would see the scars and what not but they didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>so sylvia and</p>
<p>jenny would go to like a local park</p>
<p>and it was at this</p>
<p>local park that they ran into</p>
<p>their oldest</p>
<p>sister and her name was</p>
<p>diana and she was there</p>
<p>and sylvia told her</p>
<p>sister that she was hungry</p>
<p>and diana was like oh</p>
<p>here have like this sandwich</p>
<p>gives her a sandwich and then one of the</p>
<p>other children</p>
<p>from gertrude&rsquo;s family saw her told gertrude</p>
<p>and of course</p>
<p>poor sylvia was punished</p>
<p>so they choked her they beat her</p>
<p>they threw her into</p>
<p>scalding hot water to</p>
<p>cleanse her of her sins</p>
<p>so sylvia on occasion</p>
<p>would like pass out or</p>
<p>faint from the pain</p>
<p>and gertrude this</p>
<p>would make gertrude mad so then she</p>
<p>would end up just like</p>
<p>bashing her head</p>
<p>against the wall to wake her up</p>
<p>you guys what the fuck</p>
<p>when they ran into</p>
<p>diana again weeks</p>
<p>later they told her</p>
<p>about the abuse that was happening</p>
<p>but their sister</p>
<p>diana she didn&rsquo;t believe it and she didn&rsquo;t say anything</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>what the sam hell is</p>
<p>going on over there</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know why she didn&rsquo;t believe her but she didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>so a local father had</p>
<p>phoned the high</p>
<p>school to tell</p>
<p>them that there was this girl with sores all over</p>
<p>her body at gertrude&rsquo;s</p>
<p>household so a</p>
<p>nurse was sent to investigate to see if there&rsquo;s any</p>
<p>child abuse</p>
<p>going on hallelujah</p>
<p>somebody said something</p>
<p>thank god well</p>
<p>gertrude told a</p>
<p>nurse that sylvia had run away for a week</p>
<p>and that the sores were from her poor personal hygiene</p>
<p>skills gertrude</p>
<p>would then go on</p>
<p>to say that</p>
<p>sylvia was just a rotten</p>
<p>child she was a terrible</p>
<p>influence on the</p>
<p>other children in the</p>
<p>household so she would get</p>
<p>punished on occasion</p>
<p>but it was nothing major</p>
<p>and they left so they made no</p>
<p>other attempts to</p>
<p>contact or investigate more</p>
<p>they just didn&rsquo;t feel like they needed to</p>
<p>which is like so unbelievable in</p>
<p>october diana</p>
<p>remembered the</p>
<p>older sister</p>
<p>she went to go</p>
<p>visit her sisters at gertrude&rsquo;s house</p>
<p>and then when she got there she</p>
<p>knocked on the door</p>
<p>and gertrude</p>
<p>answered and</p>
<p>she refused to let her in to see the girls because</p>
<p>the lichens family the mom and the dad</p>
<p>told gertrude</p>
<p>well this is what gertrude</p>
<p>said so i don&rsquo;t even know if this is true or not but</p>
<p>it was because the</p>
<p>lichens parents told gertrude to not let</p>
<p>jenny or sylvia see</p>
<p>their older</p>
<p>sister diana</p>
<p>due to the abuse and the repeated kicks to</p>
<p>sylvia&rsquo;s lower region</p>
<p>she began to wet the bed</p>
<p>as punishment she</p>
<p>would be thrown into the basement</p>
<p>there and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>where gertrude</p>
<p>would keep her tied up gertrude</p>
<p>would just leave her down there naked</p>
<p>starving and dehydrated</p>
<p>occasionally she</p>
<p>would be tied up to the banister of the basement</p>
<p>stairs down</p>
<p>in the basement area there was no bathroom so</p>
<p>sylvia would just go</p>
<p>standing up</p>
<p>and when this happened it would</p>
<p>piss gertrude</p>
<p>off pretty much</p>
<p>everything sylvia did just piss gertrude</p>
<p>off when sophia would</p>
<p>like wet herself</p>
<p>standing up in the beach</p>
<p>gertrude would get</p>
<p>sylvia&rsquo;s hands</p>
<p>and feet tie them together</p>
<p>and then she would</p>
<p>throw her into</p>
<p>super hot water</p>
<p>in like the bathtub and give her a bath that way</p>
<p>just to get her</p>
<p>clean again</p>
<p>so this sometimes</p>
<p>would happen</p>
<p>numerous times a day because she</p>
<p>would pee herself a couple of times a day</p>
<p>i mean where else was she posed</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s supposed to go gertrude</p>
<p>so gertrude</p>
<p>would just keep</p>
<p>sylvia locked up down in the basement</p>
<p>and honestly this</p>
<p>abuse would just continue over and over and over</p>
<p>again there was no end to it</p>
<p>then there&rsquo;s more of course</p>
<p>so gertrude</p>
<p>would have the neighborhood kids come over</p>
<p>and she would charge them</p>
<p>five cents for them to come over and</p>
<p>abuse sylvia five cents to come into the home</p>
<p>and abuse her the</p>
<p>story is awful</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not even sure why none of</p>
<p>these kids coming into the home said anything ever</p>
<p>how long has this been</p>
<p>going on and</p>
<p>nobody said anything i mean that&rsquo;s like a little</p>
<p>come on nobody said</p>
<p>a word it&rsquo;s just kind of unbelievable to me they</p>
<p>should all be held accountable</p>
<p>so at this point</p>
<p>sylvia was extremely malnourished</p>
<p>and the other children from gertrude</p>
<p>would torture her by offering her food and then they</p>
<p>would quickly just take it away</p>
<p>never in my life</p>
<p>have i ever wanted food</p>
<p>someone dead more than this</p>
<p>whole family</p>
<p>sorry you&rsquo;re supposed to forgive people</p>
<p>but sometimes the lord really makes it hard to forgive</p>
<p>really challenging you</p>
<p>so gertrude and her kids plus</p>
<p>their boyfriends</p>
<p>just did some more</p>
<p>awful shit like</p>
<p>one time they etched the words</p>
<p>quote i am a prostitute</p>
<p>and i am proud and</p>
<p>quote onto her</p>
<p>stomach okay</p>
<p>they edge that into</p>
<p>her stomach</p>
<p>and one of the fourteen</p>
<p>year old neighborhood boys his name was like richard</p>
<p>fuck you richard just took</p>
<p>turns etching</p>
<p>this into her stomach</p>
<p>gertrude&rsquo;s kids thought it&rsquo;d be a</p>
<p>great idea to</p>
<p>brand sylvia with an s</p>
<p>but instead they made it into a</p>
<p>three are they</p>
<p>stupid yes yep</p>
<p>and then gertrude</p>
<p>would just sexually</p>
<p>abuse sylvia</p>
<p>tease her about not being able to get</p>
<p>married now that she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>branded and</p>
<p>her body is garbage</p>
<p>at this point this is what gertrude</p>
<p>saying this is why</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so hard for me to believe</p>
<p>that gertrude had a normal upbringing</p>
<p>now there isn&rsquo;t much info</p>
<p>about how gertrude was raised</p>
<p>but she had to</p>
<p>learn this abuse somewhere</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not just born with this abuse</p>
<p>you learn it from people</p>
<p>i mean this is all an opinion i&rsquo;m not a doctor it just</p>
<p>is so strange to me that someone this extreme</p>
<p>is trying to say that like her</p>
<p>childhood was whatever</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re probably wondering why i even care</p>
<p>about how gertrude was raised</p>
<p>it just gives you a better</p>
<p>understanding of why they are the way</p>
<p>they are and that&rsquo;s what really kind of gets my mind</p>
<p>going is like trying to find out why</p>
<p>someone is the way they are</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s why i</p>
<p>normally like to give a background</p>
<p>story on people</p>
<p>because it does play a big role</p>
<p>so gertrude</p>
<p>made sylvia</p>
<p>write a letter to her parents</p>
<p>and this letter</p>
<p>would be her saying that she&rsquo;s running away with a</p>
<p>local group of boys</p>
<p>also gertrude</p>
<p>just wanted to</p>
<p>cover her own ass</p>
<p>because in this letter she made</p>
<p>sylvia write that</p>
<p>she was raped and</p>
<p>her body was mutilated</p>
<p>by these boys that she went</p>
<p>she ran away with</p>
<p>gertrude&rsquo;s plan was to hand this letter to her parents</p>
<p>when they came by the</p>
<p>house to see</p>
<p>sylvia and jenny what gertrude was really</p>
<p>going to do was take</p>
<p>sylvia to the front</p>
<p>area nearby</p>
<p>and leave her</p>
<p>there to starve to</p>
<p>death she was sick of</p>
<p>sylvia and just wanted to get rid of her</p>
<p>so she made her</p>
<p>write this letter</p>
<p>so the parents</p>
<p>would be like</p>
<p>oh she ran away</p>
<p>stupid i&rsquo;m so mad</p>
<p>anyway so the letter pretty much just said like</p>
<p>hey i went with a gang of boys in the middle of the</p>
<p>then they beat me up and they</p>
<p>rape me left source on my face and all over my body</p>
<p>and they also put on my stomach i am a prostitute and</p>
<p>proud of it so then on</p>
<p>october 25th</p>
<p>sylvia tried to escape</p>
<p>when she heard</p>
<p>gertrude&rsquo;s plan to drop her off at the forest and</p>
<p>leave her there</p>
<p>she heard gertrude saying this</p>
<p>so she&rsquo;s trying to make an escape but</p>
<p>sadly she was</p>
<p>caught before she made it off the property so they</p>
<p>just punished her</p>
<p>again pretty hard</p>
<p>and they beat her</p>
<p>until she blocked out</p>
<p>later that evening</p>
<p>sylvia banged on the walls of the basement and</p>
<p>screamed as loud as she could</p>
<p>in hopes that like the neighbors</p>
<p>would hear her or something and a neighbor</p>
<p>would later testify that she</p>
<p>heard these</p>
<p>noises of like</p>
<p>screaming and</p>
<p>someone yelling for help but that they stopped so</p>
<p>she decided</p>
<p>not to call the police because she assumed like oh</p>
<p>they must have</p>
<p>just been playing or it was handled or something</p>
<p>so the abuse continued but</p>
<p>sylvia was very weak at this</p>
<p>point she had</p>
<p>tried to crawl up the stairs</p>
<p>get out but</p>
<p>couldn&rsquo;t make it instead gertrude was at the top of the</p>
<p>staircase and pretty much beat her</p>
<p>back down to the base</p>
<p>gertrude hit</p>
<p>sylvia&rsquo;s head really hard at this time</p>
<p>sylvia stopped breathing</p>
<p>in an effort to</p>
<p>clean her up one of the kids</p>
<p>tried to give her a warm</p>
<p>like soapy bath</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s when she realized that</p>
<p>sylvia was indeed dead</p>
<p>so she tried to give her</p>
<p>mouth to mouth</p>
<p>gertrude was certain that sophia</p>
<p>was just faking it</p>
<p>and she just told her to like just let her</p>
<p>go like she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just faking it</p>
<p>and then she realized</p>
<p>that sylvia was indeed dead</p>
<p>gertrude told</p>
<p>like stephanie&rsquo;s boyfriend</p>
<p>he needed to go call the police</p>
<p>but from like a</p>
<p>local pay phone</p>
<p>so he leaves the</p>
<p>house and he goes</p>
<p>and calls the police</p>
<p>so police do arrive and gertrude told them that</p>
<p>sylvia ran away and this is how she returned</p>
<p>and that when she</p>
<p>found her she was tending to her all day trying to</p>
<p>clean her up and get her better</p>
<p>jenny who is</p>
<p>sylvia&rsquo;s sister</p>
<p>now mind you this is a side note</p>
<p>jenny really</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t even getting abused at all it was just towards</p>
<p>sylvia anywho but</p>
<p>jenny was able</p>
<p>to talk to one of the police officers on the scene</p>
<p>and she said or she&rsquo;d like</p>
<p>whispered into one of the police officer&rsquo;s</p>
<p>ears get me out of here and i&rsquo;ll tell you everything</p>
<p>police were able to get</p>
<p>jenny out of there and talk to her and she explained</p>
<p>everything that had been</p>
<p>going on inside that</p>
<p>house and based on</p>
<p>jenny&rsquo;s testimony</p>
<p>police then were able to arrest gertrude</p>
<p>three of her kids plus</p>
<p>two of the boyfriends</p>
<p>additionally</p>
<p>five neighborhood children</p>
<p>were arrested and</p>
<p>charged with causing injury to a person</p>
<p>they were released to</p>
<p>their parents but</p>
<p>all had to appear in</p>
<p>court and give a</p>
<p>statement which is</p>
<p>horseshit if you ask me</p>
<p>so gertrude</p>
<p>initially refused any involvement</p>
<p>she only admitted that she</p>
<p>had made sylvia</p>
<p>sleep in the basement</p>
<p>when she was wetting the bed</p>
<p>because she just didn&rsquo;t want to ruin her mattress</p>
<p>gertrude would</p>
<p>become like really agitated when police officers</p>
<p>would question</p>
<p>her further asking more questions as to what happened</p>
<p>they pretty much were telling gertrude</p>
<p>that sylvia&rsquo;s body and like her internal damage it just</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t line up with her story</p>
<p>so the autopsy revealed that</p>
<p>sylvia had over</p>
<p>150 wounds on her body</p>
<p>she was incredibly thin and malnourished</p>
<p>there were burns cuts bruises and severe muscle damage</p>
<p>all of her fingernails had been</p>
<p>bent backwards and she was missing the top</p>
<p>layer of skin</p>
<p>on her face neck</p>
<p>chest and knee</p>
<p>the official</p>
<p>cause of death</p>
<p>blunt force</p>
<p>trauma to the head</p>
<p>so gertrude paula</p>
<p>which was gertrude&rsquo;s</p>
<p>daughter and then john the son they were</p>
<p>going to be</p>
<p>tried for first degree murder</p>
<p>and one of the kids her name was stephanie</p>
<p>do you remember stephanie</p>
<p>her charges were</p>
<p>dropped due to insufficient</p>
<p>evidence but she did</p>
<p>agree to testify</p>
<p>against her family at</p>
<p>trial richard</p>
<p>hobbs and coy</p>
<p>hubbard they were</p>
<p>charged with premeditated</p>
<p>malice they were like the boyfriend slash</p>
<p>neighbor kid gertrude&rsquo;s</p>
<p>defense was that she was not responsible for the kids</p>
<p>because the</p>
<p>other children</p>
<p>were responsible for the children</p>
<p>because she was too</p>
<p>depressed to be able to take control of the household</p>
<p>so the kids were to</p>
<p>blame not her she was just depressed</p>
<p>fuck off the</p>
<p>trial and decision</p>
<p>of the jury lasted 17</p>
<p>days and gertrude was convicted of</p>
<p>first degree murder think</p>
<p>god richard</p>
<p>coy and john</p>
<p>were all convicted</p>
<p>of manslaughter</p>
<p>gertrude and paula</p>
<p>they were giving life sentences</p>
<p>during a retrial</p>
<p>hers was changed to voluntary manslaughter</p>
<p>and her sentence was reduced to</p>
<p>two to 21 years</p>
<p>she would only</p>
<p>serve three years in prison</p>
<p>and then she was let out coy and john</p>
<p>they were sentenced to 18</p>
<p>months at a juvenile</p>
<p>detention facility</p>
<p>richard would have a mental break</p>
<p>the weight of the</p>
<p>crimes hit him and then he</p>
<p>began smoking</p>
<p>really heavily and he died of lung cancer at 21</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m laughing because</p>
<p>he must have</p>
<p>been smoking a lot to die of lung cancer at 21</p>
<p>good bye i know you&rsquo;re supposed to</p>
<p>forgive but they&rsquo;re making it really difficult anyways</p>
<p>so coy was in and out</p>
<p>of prison all of his life he died at 56 years of age</p>
<p>of a heart attack and during the retrial for gertrude</p>
<p>she was still convicted of</p>
<p>first degree murder but her sentence was</p>
<p>changed to 18 to life in prison she was a</p>
<p>model prisoner she worked in the sewing room and the</p>
<p>other inmates called her mom</p>
<p>and then guess what</p>
<p>her parole came up in 1985 and she</p>
<p>changed her name to nadine</p>
<p>van fawson this</p>
<p>upset a lot of people</p>
<p>they made a petition</p>
<p>to keep her in prison</p>
<p>and it had about 4</p>
<p>500 signatures but</p>
<p>guess what she was still</p>
<p>granted parole</p>
<p>she moved to goddamn iowa</p>
<p>where she lived for five years</p>
<p>until she died of lung cancer in</p>
<p>1990 paula she also</p>
<p>moved to iowa</p>
<p>after her release</p>
<p>and like back</p>
<p>close to her mom</p>
<p>she changed her name and get this she became a teacher</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s an idea idea</p>
<p>alert people who have done terrible things</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t think you</p>
<p>should be allowed to change your name</p>
<p>right anyways</p>
<p>paula was a</p>
<p>teacher for a</p>
<p>minute then</p>
<p>the school district</p>
<p>they did discover her past now she was arrested</p>
<p>and all that and they did fire her</p>
<p>but the fact that she got through and was even a</p>
<p>teacher for a</p>
<p>small amount of time</p>
<p>is not okay so john</p>
<p>he changed his name to john</p>
<p>blake he worked several jobs</p>
<p>and get this</p>
<p>he became a minister</p>
<p>he said that</p>
<p>he took full responsibility for what he did and</p>
<p>he should have been handed a harder sentence</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what he said</p>
<p>of course he&rsquo;s saying that because he&rsquo;s out of prison</p>
<p>if he were in prison he&rsquo;d be asking for forgiveness</p>
<p>but now that he&rsquo;s out he&rsquo;s like yeah i</p>
<p>should have gotten a harder sentence i</p>
<p>learned my lesson</p>
<p>jenny she went on to</p>
<p>marry a man and have some children</p>
<p>and jenny is sylvia&rsquo;s</p>
<p>sister remember</p>
<p>so jenny never blamed her parents for the</p>
<p>abuse that her and her</p>
<p>sister endured</p>
<p>she said that they</p>
<p>were just trying</p>
<p>to make ends mean they did the best that they</p>
<p>could at the time good for her</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s able to like move forward i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>trying to see</p>
<p>some kind of positive here okay so in two thousand one</p>
<p>a memorial for</p>
<p>sylvia was erected</p>
<p>in indianapolis</p>
<p>and there was actually a</p>
<p>movie made it was called an american</p>
<p>crime and it was</p>
<p>about the whole</p>
<p>story i tried to</p>
<p>watch it last</p>
<p>night it had a lot of well</p>
<p>known actors in it and</p>
<p>stuff but i just</p>
<p>couldn&rsquo;t do it it was too much</p>
<p>research in this</p>
<p>story was just not okay</p>
<p>so that is the</p>
<p>awful story</p>
<p>about this gertrude</p>
<p>devil woman</p>
<p>i shouldn&rsquo;t hate anybody but</p>
<p>lord do i hate this</p>
<p>woman and her</p>
<p>whole family i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>sorry but they</p>
<p>should all be in prison</p>
<p>none of them</p>
<p>should have been able to change her name</p>
<p>the story was just really</p>
<p>upsetting i&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>upsetting to you as well there&rsquo;s a lot more details</p>
<p>about the abuse that poor</p>
<p>sylvia had endured</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just like it&rsquo;s a fucking lot</p>
<p>thank you so much for hanging out with me</p>
<p>today i&rsquo;m sorry if i seem a little down</p>
<p>but this story is</p>
<p>definitely a downer</p>
<p>and rest in</p>
<p>peace to poor</p>
<p>sylvia who had to go through all that</p>
<p>for no damn reason i hope that you have a wonderful day</p>
<p>today you make good choices</p>
<p>please be safe out there</p>
