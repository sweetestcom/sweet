    <p>Hi friends, so this week we&rsquo;re talking about gym anxiety and I&rsquo;m gonna tell you</p>
<p>all my tips and tricks and I&rsquo;m gonna give you a couple mindset shifts and</p>
<p>perspectives to take on so that you feel less anxious at the gym because I</p>
<p>remember what it&rsquo;s like to be new and I struggle with it for so fucking long.</p>
<p>So the way that I actually started getting into fitness was I was 14 and I was a</p>
<p>fat little shit like I was just a little porky and I was too embarrassed and like</p>
<p>shy to go to a gym so I begged my dad to buy me the little workout program that</p>
<p>you do at home called P90X. It&rsquo;s not the best thing there is but it&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>got me started. So for like six months I just did P90X at home and just worked</p>
<p>out from my fucking living room. I&rsquo;d put on my little CD and fucking do what they</p>
<p>did on the TV. Like I had some weights and I just did my shit. After a while of</p>
<p>doing that, after getting comfortable with my body and the way that I looked</p>
<p>and after getting comfortable with doing certain exercises and getting the form</p>
<p>right, then I felt comfortable enough to go to a gym. But there&rsquo;s so much anxiety</p>
<p>around that shit like it just seems like such a big task to do and I&rsquo;m gonna</p>
<p>tell you all the things that have helped me. So the way I kind of have this</p>
<p>episode laid out is we&rsquo;re gonna talk about all my like general confidence</p>
<p>tips like just random shit you need to know and like shift in your mind so you</p>
<p>feel more confident and then I&rsquo;m gonna go through what to do if you&rsquo;re a</p>
<p>beginner. So like my main steps that I would tell someone that&rsquo;s a beginner</p>
<p>like newbie to the gym and newbie to working out, I&rsquo;m gonna give you like a</p>
<p>rundown for that. But I&rsquo;m gonna hit like the applicable things to everybody at</p>
<p>the beginning and then we&rsquo;ll get to the beginners. But everything for the</p>
<p>beginners is also applicable to every Joe Schmo. So let&rsquo;s just jump into this</p>
<p>shit because I have a lot to say. So the first thing that&rsquo;s like a general tip</p>
<p>and kind of like thing you need to realize about going to the gym is the</p>
<p>gym is the expected place for you to go to work on your body and to want to</p>
<p>improve yourself. Like that is very much the obvious place to go to do that. So</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not out of place if you want to go to a gym to look better. That&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>expected place to go. When you&rsquo;re sick, you go to a doctor. When you want your</p>
<p>hair done, you go to hair salon. When you want your nails done, you go to nail</p>
<p>salon. It&rsquo;s the expected place to go for the thing that you want to achieve. So I</p>
<p>just want to set that right in your mind first. You&rsquo;re not out of place. You&rsquo;re in</p>
<p>the correct place you need to be. Okay so I&rsquo;m gonna walk you through what I do to</p>
<p>feel confident like I was been going to the gym. So first things fucking first. I</p>
<p>pick a good-ass song to walk into the gym to. I&rsquo;ll be putting on my headphones</p>
<p>and I put on a good-ass song. Something that&rsquo;s gonna make me feel like fuck</p>
<p>everything, fuck everybody. And my go-to song is Carlton by Suicide Boys. That</p>
<p>song literally helps me tap into the side of me that&rsquo;s so fucking confident</p>
<p>and don&rsquo;t give a shit about any single person on earth. So that&rsquo;s tip one is</p>
<p>pick a good-ass song to walk into the gym to. And it&rsquo;s nice to have some kind</p>
<p>of like auditory distraction while you&rsquo;re walking in the gym and I love a</p>
<p>good song. But sometimes I have to like put on something very intense and</p>
<p>sometimes I have to put on something that&rsquo;s like a good beat to get me going.</p>
<p>You know just pick your fucking mood because sometimes I be walking into</p>
<p>Lana Del Rey ready to fucking cry. But the first thing I do when I get to the</p>
<p>gym is I beeline straight for the treadmill. And the reason I do that is</p>
<p>because when you&rsquo;re walking in somewhere and you know where you&rsquo;re going first, it</p>
<p>gives you a second to like debrief. So I&rsquo;ll walk my ass straight to the</p>
<p>treadmill, straight to the cardio section and go get on a treadmill. And I will get</p>
<p>on the treadmill for like 10 minutes and warm up and just walk. But when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>walking into the gym or walking into any kind of establishment you already have</p>
<p>that like hit of anxiety. It&rsquo;s like when you were in school and you were walking</p>
<p>to class. It&rsquo;s like if you were the one that was late to class everyone&rsquo;s</p>
<p>fucking looking at you. That&rsquo;s how it feels to walk in the gym sometimes. So</p>
<p>having somewhere to go and just walking straight to the treadmill and getting on</p>
<p>it allows me to kind of like decompress from like the like what is it called</p>
<p>like social anxiety trip of like oh the fuck. So I&rsquo;ll literally just go get on</p>
<p>the treadmill and then I people watch for 10 minutes. Like I warm up for 10</p>
<p>minutes. I pick a good song. I get in the right headspace. I feel safe for a second</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m not like on display like walking through the gym anymore. I&rsquo;m at</p>
<p>my treadmill. I&rsquo;m able to like and then I just people watch and I&rsquo;ll see who&rsquo;s on</p>
<p>what. I&rsquo;ll see what&rsquo;s busy. I&rsquo;ll think what am I gonna do first in the gym. Like</p>
<p>what is my workouts gonna be. A lot of people will go in with a game plan and</p>
<p>have their workout already laid out for them. Good for you. I don&rsquo;t like to do</p>
<p>that. I figure out what the fuck I want to do when I get there. I&rsquo;ve been doing</p>
<p>this long enough I can do that. But going in with a game plan of what you&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>do helps. But just knowing that I&rsquo;m walking straight in and to the treadmill</p>
<p>gives me a second to kind of like debrief. When you walk into the gym with</p>
<p>no set place you&rsquo;re gonna walk to first you have this like panic and kind of</p>
<p>anxiety of like walking in and you&rsquo;re looking for a machine to get on and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re like you&rsquo;re a little anxious. Like some people have it really bad and some</p>
<p>people don&rsquo;t. It gets better with time. But having a dedicated place you know</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re walking to first that&rsquo;s not gonna be taken. Like if you have a certain</p>
<p>machine in mind motherfuckers will always be on it as soon as you decide it</p>
<p>in your mind it&rsquo;s gonna be taken. So I always go to the treadmill. But walking</p>
<p>into the gym and just looking for a machine to jump on you&rsquo;re not giving</p>
<p>yourself time to decompress from like the stress you&rsquo;re feeling. You&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>trying to jump on a machine and you&rsquo;re gonna be like like anxious and like</p>
<p>nervous. So give yourself a second. Walk on the treadmill. Get on a fucking</p>
<p>elliptical. Get on a Stairmaster. Who gives a shit? Ten minutes to get your</p>
<p>body warmed up is good because a lot of people just run right in the gym and</p>
<p>start lifting and if you don&rsquo;t warm your body up properly you can get injured.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s a higher likelihood for injury. So that&rsquo;s why I do that. But it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so many reasons that I fucking get on the treadmill first. But the main</p>
<p>thing is like debrief, people watch, and decompress. And as you get your blood</p>
<p>pumping with cardio or with anything your body&rsquo;s gonna start releasing</p>
<p>endorphins so you&rsquo;re gonna start feeling better. That&rsquo;s just a given. That&rsquo;s</p>
<p>guaranteed. So on the days where you&rsquo;re like oh fuck it I don&rsquo;t want to go to the</p>
<p>fucking gym or you&rsquo;re walking in the gym and you&rsquo;re real anxious and you&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>oh my god I just want to leave. As soon as you get your blood flowing all that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna kind of go away and you&rsquo;re gonna start feeling good. Just get your fucking</p>
<p>heart rate up. Get your blood pumping and it&rsquo;s just gonna take care of itself for</p>
<p>the most part. The next thing I want to say is around like your mindset. You</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t stick out as bad as you think you do. Like I&rsquo;m six foot seven. When I walk</p>
<p>into a fucking room people look. I&rsquo;m always on display. I&rsquo;ve always been on</p>
<p>display my whole fucking life. It&rsquo;s just how it fucking goes. But you look a lot</p>
<p>more normal than you think. It took me a while to realize when people are looking</p>
<p>at me it&rsquo;s not because like something&rsquo;s wrong or like they&rsquo;re looking at me to</p>
<p>judge me. I&rsquo;m this giant fucking mammoth like walking into a room. I&rsquo;m gonna pull</p>
<p>people&rsquo;s attention. You know when a motherfucker&rsquo;s head almost hits the door</p>
<p>frame it&rsquo;s like what the fuck? Like who&rsquo;s this? So I get that feeling very</p>
<p>well. I deal with it every single day of my life. I always feel like I&rsquo;m on display.</p>
<p>But what I want to reassure people who are like normal sized or even people</p>
<p>that are my size is you don&rsquo;t stick out. If you&rsquo;re walking into the gym and you</p>
<p>have on normal gym clothes or a hoodie and sweatpants you fit in. As long as</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not wearing like high heels to the gym or a fucking tutu people are not</p>
<p>looking at you because you stick out. Like some douchebags in the gym</p>
<p>literally wear sunglasses like please. But I want to reassure you you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>look fucking weird. You look very much normal. And I want you to literally think</p>
<p>about observing yourself walking to the gym. If you saw yourself walk in the gym</p>
<p>do you look out of place? No. Do you look weird? Like I said no. You&rsquo;re not in a</p>
<p>fucking tutu. If you&rsquo;re dressed for the occasion you look fine. Just walk your</p>
<p>ass in and start working out. If you literally deduce what working is down</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to play on a couple little machines and do some movements. Not that</p>
<p>big of a deal. It&rsquo;s actually like a funny little activity. Like we all just go to</p>
<p>the gym and like pick things up and put them down. That&rsquo;s fucking funny. But with</p>
<p>your outfit I am gonna say put effort into what you&rsquo;re wearing if you&rsquo;re an</p>
<p>anxious person or if you have any kind of nervousness around going to the gym.</p>
<p>Not because you want to dress for anybody. Like if you&rsquo;re a girl put on</p>
<p>fucking makeup if you want to. Put effort into your appearance. Put effort</p>
<p>into your outfit. Because it&rsquo;s going to give you a feeling of boosted</p>
<p>confidence. When you feel on. When you feel like you took a second to like make</p>
<p>sure you look good before you left the house. Like motherfuckers that just like</p>
<p>wake up and throw on anything they see and then take off to the gym. Couldn&rsquo;t be</p>
<p>me. I don&rsquo;t know how they fucking do it. It&rsquo;s not a God complex confidence. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just delusion. Like you&rsquo;re so not aware that you&rsquo;re able to just do that. Like I</p>
<p>used to look at people that didn&rsquo;t care about their appearance like oh they just</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t give a fuck and they&rsquo;re truly confident. No girl they&rsquo;re just unaware.</p>
<p>But your appearance is a big part of things and if you want to be taken</p>
<p>serious and if you want to feel good look good. Like that&rsquo;s just something you</p>
<p>can do to contribute to you feeling more comfortable. So fucking do it. Don&rsquo;t let</p>
<p>nobody make you feel bad if you want to go put makeup on before you go to the</p>
<p>gym. Eat a fucking dick. Literally just cut this clip and send it to them. Or</p>
<p>play it to them. Eat a fucking dick bitch. If you want to wear makeup wear fucking</p>
<p>makeup. It&rsquo;s not for anybody. It&rsquo;s for yourself to give yourself that feeling</p>
<p>of confidence and like you&rsquo;ve prepared. The more you prepare for something and</p>
<p>the more you get ready the more confident you will feel. So apply that to</p>
<p>your outfit and apply that to your looks and your appearance. So when you walk</p>
<p>into the gym you&rsquo;re not sitting here already anxious about going to the gym</p>
<p>and also like oh my god I don&rsquo;t look right I feel weird. Like that goes away.</p>
<p>It just alleviates a certain amount of stress from it. So fucking put some</p>
<p>effort into your appearance. Wear something cute. And with that there are</p>
<p>some days where I just do not give a fuck and I don&rsquo;t want to be seen. I feel</p>
<p>like not good. So I&rsquo;ll literally just throw on a hoodie and sweatpants and</p>
<p>hide basically. Like if I&rsquo;m not gonna like show off my body or like show parts</p>
<p>of me I&rsquo;m just gonna completely cover myself to fuck up. I&rsquo;m just this fucking</p>
<p>shadow. This black shadow because I only wear black. I&rsquo;m like I&rsquo;m just here to</p>
<p>lift and work out. You don&rsquo;t need to see what&rsquo;s under here. Like it just makes you</p>
<p>feel hidden and it makes you feel good. Like if you&rsquo;re having a day where you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t feel good just cover yourself the fuck up and go. And with covering</p>
<p>yourself up one thing I do to like boost my confidence because if you just go in</p>
<p>with like some oversized shit you might feel a little like insecure. So something</p>
<p>that I do is I wear tight clothes underneath my baggy shit. So if I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>wearing a hoodie I&rsquo;m wearing a wife beater underneath because feeling the</p>
<p>tight like clothing on my skin reminds me that like we ain&rsquo;t fat. We little</p>
<p>snatched. But having on tight clothes underneath baggy clothes will allow you</p>
<p>to feel hidden but also feel confident that you&rsquo;re not like some fat lazy like</p>
<p>slob. Like I feel like just a bag of fucking skin if I just have loose clothes</p>
<p>on. Like I like to be a little bit of a hooah. I like to have some shit out. So</p>
<p>when I&rsquo;m gonna hide all my skin I still want to feel tight and like good. I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>want to just walk around in like oversized shit. You know like wear</p>
<p>something underneath like I said for the way that you feel. It will make you feel</p>
<p>better. And if you get to a point in the gym where you&rsquo;re feeling your goddamn</p>
<p>stuff you can take your hoodie off and show what you&rsquo;ve been working on. You</p>
<p>know? So the next thing I want to say is about people looking at you. People are</p>
<p>not as concerned with what you&rsquo;re doing than you think. And I&rsquo;m gonna give you</p>
<p>like the perfect explanation of this. Think about when you&rsquo;re at the gym. When</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m at the gym I&rsquo;m literally so focused in my own world like trying to count my</p>
<p>reps, count my sets, think of what I&rsquo;m gonna do next, and then think of what</p>
<p>song I&rsquo;m gonna put on for my next set. Like I&rsquo;m playing on my phone. I&rsquo;m picking</p>
<p>my song. I&rsquo;m like doing all these fucking things. And also with lifting</p>
<p>heavy weight you have to get yourself in a certain mindset to do it. So if people</p>
<p>look fucking mean or if people are looking at you like bad they&rsquo;re probably</p>
<p>in their own head trying to get their self ready to lift. That&rsquo;s what I have to</p>
<p>fucking do. Like I have to think about some real fucked up shit to get ready to</p>
<p>push some weight. So I walk around with an eat shit look on my fucking face. Am I</p>
<p>mad at anybody? No. Am I judging anybody? No. I&rsquo;m trying to get my head right so I</p>
<p>can do this fucking set. So I don&rsquo;t want you to look around the gym and think</p>
<p>that people are just like mean and mean mugging you and being rude to you. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not personal. You don&rsquo;t know what the fuck they&rsquo;re trying to do to execute</p>
<p>their workout. But do you think that me trying to fucking count my reps, count my</p>
<p>sets, pick a song, and then get myself mentally in the headspace to lift the</p>
<p>weight I&rsquo;m about to lift. Do you think I have time to also think about what Betty</p>
<p>Bop is doing in the fucking corner? No. If you look normal my attention is not</p>
<p>on you. Now if some motherfucker is over on the cable swinging from him like</p>
<p>fucking Batman or someone like slams their weight really loud I&rsquo;m not gonna</p>
<p>notice. Like if I do see Batman swinging on the fucking cables I&rsquo;m literally just</p>
<p>gonna be like look over me like okay and go back to my shit because I have to</p>
<p>stay focused for what I&rsquo;m about to do. So I just wanted to give you that</p>
<p>perspective because a lot of the times you&rsquo;re gonna think everybody&rsquo;s looking</p>
<p>at you. Everybody is so invested up their own ass at the gym and you have to</p>
<p>be to be able to have a good workout. Sorry like that&rsquo;s just the way it goes.</p>
<p>I love you but not everybody&rsquo;s worried about you. We&rsquo;re all worried about our</p>
<p>own ass. Also with people looking at you you get to assume what it means when you</p>
<p>see someone looking at you. So someone can just be looking at you. That is a</p>
<p>neutral behavior for someone to glance over and look at you. That&rsquo;s neutral. What</p>
<p>makes it positive or negative is the meaning you assign to it. So if you</p>
<p>assume oh they&rsquo;re looking at me to make fun of me you&rsquo;re gonna feel like it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>negative stare. If you look at it like oh they&rsquo;re admiring me it&rsquo;s gonna feel like</p>
<p>a positive stare. You get to assign the meaning for when people look at you. So</p>
<p>observe yourself and the meanings you assign to it when you get nervous that</p>
<p>people are looking at you. People might be looking at you to admire you in the</p>
<p>way you walk or like you maybe you have good lips or like good hair and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>just like whoa shit. Maybe you carry yourself really well and they&rsquo;re looking</p>
<p>at that. Maybe you&rsquo;re on a machine that they need and they&rsquo;re just like looking</p>
<p>over and checking to see when you&rsquo;re gonna be done. Also people could be</p>
<p>making fun of you in their own head. That&rsquo;s a possibility with people looking</p>
<p>at you. But there are so many other possibilities of why someone is looking</p>
<p>at you at the gym than just to make fun of you. So if you only assign like oh</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re making fun of me they&rsquo;re looking at me because I&rsquo;m doing something wrong</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;re judging me. If that&rsquo;s the only meaning that you cling to the gym is</p>
<p>going to be a terrible fucking experience. So start noticing what you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>assuming when you see someone look at you and then entertain other</p>
<p>possibilities. Are they actually looking at me to make fun of me? Do they like my</p>
<p>shoes? I have cool shoes on. Are they looking at my shoes because they like my</p>
<p>shoes? Are they looking at me because I&rsquo;m cute? Are they looking at me because I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>ugly? What is it? You get to assign any meaning you want to it. And kind of</p>
<p>piggybacking off that, if you&rsquo;re scared of people judging you, every single person</p>
<p>in the gym, I don&rsquo;t care how good they look, started from the bottom. Everybody</p>
<p>looked like a wet fucking noodle when they first started at the gym. Every</p>
<p>single one of us has looked like shit at some point. But anyone that&rsquo;s in the gym</p>
<p>knows what it&rsquo;s like to come from the bottom and build up. So a lot of people</p>
<p>have felt the exact same way that you have. A lot of people have felt anxious</p>
<p>when they were small going to the gym and they were looking up at the big guys.</p>
<p>Everybody&rsquo;s had that moment. So I want you to remember that. I don&rsquo;t care how</p>
<p>big, tough, and scary someone looks at the gym. Just think of who they were when</p>
<p>they were little. Like if you look at a big muscular dude, just think</p>
<p>what he was when he was the wet little fucking noodle when he first started. And</p>
<p>it will immediately like take him off this pedestal that you put him on</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s muscular now. He&rsquo;s still a human. He&rsquo;s still had that experience. He&rsquo;s</p>
<p>still started from the bottom. People look at me and probably get stressed out.</p>
<p>Motherfucker, I used to look like shit. I used to be fat as fuck. And then I used</p>
<p>to be a twig, like skinny. Girl, it took me a while to get here. And I know exactly</p>
<p>what it&rsquo;s like to be on the other end of it. And everyone does. Everyone knows</p>
<p>what it&rsquo;s like to go into the gym and be anxious and be nervous because you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>new and not know what the fuck to do and not know if your form looks right. I want</p>
<p>you to just remind yourself, they&rsquo;ve been at the bottom too. They&rsquo;ve been where I</p>
<p>was. Some people get out of touch with that. And some people act like fucking</p>
<p>assholes. But then again, you don&rsquo;t know why someone is acting so like big for</p>
<p>their britches. Maybe they&rsquo;re anxious too. Maybe that&rsquo;s their little coping</p>
<p>mechanism for being anxious. Like you shut down when you&rsquo;re anxious. Other</p>
<p>people might get overly boastful because they can&rsquo;t even hold space for the</p>
<p>insecurity or it will cripple them. So they have to just swing to blind</p>
<p>delusion of confidence of I&rsquo;m the best thing in the fucking world. My shit</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t stink. A lot of people have to take on that attitude. Like frat boys will do</p>
<p>a couple push-ups and get a couple muscles and they&rsquo;re the fucking biggest</p>
<p>dude in the world over here fucking five foot eight. People have to live in</p>
<p>their own delusion. Everybody&rsquo;s just trying to accomplish their goals and</p>
<p>everybody has to go about it in the way that works for them. So even if someone</p>
<p>is a fucking asshole, you get to assign the meaning. Are they being an asshole to</p>
<p>me? Are they being an asshole because they&rsquo;re a fucking asshole? Because I look</p>
<p>like a fucking dick at the gym. I look like a raging dickhead at the gym. I have</p>
<p>the meanest look on my face. But my typical coping mechanism when I get</p>
<p>anxious or worried or I&rsquo;m dealing with a lot mentally is my face just goes</p>
<p>fucking mad and I just like shut down and I go through the movements. I look</p>
<p>like a motherfucker in the gym. Like I look so just annoyed unhappy to be there</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m having to do what I have to do to get through it. Like my friend Daniel</p>
<p>literally text me the other day because he saw me walking through the gym and I</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t say hi to him. I didn&rsquo;t see him but he literally text me and was like</p>
<p>yo what&rsquo;s wrong? Like I didn&rsquo;t want to say hi to you. You looked like pissed off</p>
<p>and I was like no I&rsquo;m just like dealing with a lot. Like my whole clothing launch</p>
<p>launched last week and that&rsquo;s what happened. Like I was just so anxious and</p>
<p>so many things were going on inside me. My outside just checked out and I just</p>
<p>like got laser focused and he thought I was pissed off and I was like no I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>fine. I&rsquo;m just stressed. So you don&rsquo;t know why someone looks mean. You don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>why someone looks mad. You don&rsquo;t know why someone looks annoyed. It might just be</p>
<p>their own little thing and whenever I see someone at the gym I always make it</p>
<p>an effort to smile or be nice and whenever I&rsquo;m at the gym, like it</p>
<p>happened today, I always watch out for people while they&rsquo;re lifting. I look like</p>
<p>a mean motherfucker. I look unapproachable. I don&rsquo;t like when people</p>
<p>fuck with me while I&rsquo;m working out. If you recognize me and you see me come to</p>
<p>me between a set and I don&rsquo;t mind. But when people see me at the gym they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know like my heart. You would have no clue that I care as much as I do about</p>
<p>every single person that walks this earth. So I&rsquo;m always watching out for</p>
<p>everybody and this guy was benching a couple benches down from me and all his</p>
<p>friends were like talking shit and like kicking in the corner and he like was</p>
<p>trying to bench and he couldn&rsquo;t get the weight up. Like he like had to drop it on</p>
<p>his chest and he was like looking at his friends like help me and I walked over</p>
<p>and I got it off of him and his friends were all like oh shit thanks. Like people</p>
<p>are looking out for you. People are not looking at you to judge you because you&rsquo;d</p>
<p>look at me and think that I was just some annoyed motherfucker who&rsquo;s like too</p>
<p>big for his britches. But really I&rsquo;m just trying to get focused and get my</p>
<p>head right but I&rsquo;m still looking out for everybody and I didn&rsquo;t say anything to</p>
<p>the guy. I literally just pulled it off of him smiled and then went back to my</p>
<p>shit. Like it&rsquo;s not a big thing but I want you to realize people are not as</p>
<p>hateful as you think. People are not as judgmental as you think. People might be</p>
<p>looking out for you because I always am. I don&rsquo;t care if it&rsquo;s the newbie or the</p>
<p>biggest guy in the gym. I look out for everybody because everybody needs help.</p>
<p>Everybody gets anxious. Everybody feels the same things and that&rsquo;s where I want</p>
<p>to say stop assuming people are not human also. Every single person in the</p>
<p>gym feels that same gym anxiety. You would look at me and think I don&rsquo;t. I do.</p>
<p>Every single person you see, I don&rsquo;t care how good they look. I don&rsquo;t care how big</p>
<p>they are. Every single person feels that same anxiety that you feel. The only</p>
<p>difference between you and us is we&rsquo;ve tolerated it. We can deal with it and</p>
<p>continue moving through the motions and continue moving toward our goals. All of</p>
<p>us feel it. So you get to choose what you&rsquo;re gonna do. You can still function</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re anxious. You can still function if you&rsquo;re fearful. So you get to decide</p>
<p>okay I&rsquo;m anxious. All of us are. Don&rsquo;t single yourself out and convince</p>
<p>yourself you&rsquo;re the only one that&rsquo;s scared of the gym and that gets anxious</p>
<p>and that gets nervous. I&rsquo;ve been going since I&rsquo;m fucking 16. I&rsquo;m 24 now. I still</p>
<p>get anxious. I&rsquo;ve learned to deal with it. I have so many ways of making myself</p>
<p>feel better and these are the things that I&rsquo;m sharing but you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>different from anyone. We all share that. So I want you to kind of take motivation</p>
<p>and inspiration from that. Look around and understand every single person</p>
<p>around you is a human being. We all feel the same shit and you&rsquo;re not alone in</p>
<p>the way that you feel. If you just watch certain people, you can tell that they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>anxious. Some people can&rsquo;t hide it well. They&rsquo;ll fidget or they&rsquo;ll do</p>
<p>something. Just look around and start observing people&rsquo;s body language and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll see that so many more people are anxious and their body shows it and make</p>
<p>an effort to smile at them. Make an effort to make them feel comfortable</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s what you want and it&rsquo;s gonna make you feel more comfortable if</p>
<p>you smile at somebody and they smile back. It&rsquo;s like boom now you immediately</p>
<p>feel like a sense of like okay we got each other. Like we&rsquo;re nice. It&rsquo;s like a</p>
<p>friendly environment now. Motherfucker just walk around and just like smile at</p>
<p>people. You don&rsquo;t have to like full like teeth smile. You can just like smile.</p>
<p>Throw a little smirk around and people will reciprocate it and it just kind of</p>
<p>like breaks down that energy of the gym. Like if you think everybody&rsquo;s</p>
<p>judgmental and everybody&rsquo;s mean, start cracking smiles. Just like half smile at</p>
<p>people when you walk by them or like do a little straight bro like what&rsquo;s up and</p>
<p>see how many people reciprocate and are nice to you. Everybody knows what it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like. Like I said to start at the bottom and to be anxious. Everybody in the gym</p>
<p>wants comfort. Everybody in the gym is feeling the same shit. So I just really</p>
<p>wanted to get that across but you&rsquo;re not crazy. You&rsquo;re not weak. You&rsquo;re not a</p>
<p>bitch. Everybody feels it. Okay this next section of my notes I titled it Get Real</p>
<p>because this is where I&rsquo;m gonna hit you with some tough love because you need to</p>
<p>fucking hear it. I have to tell myself this all the time. Are you really going</p>
<p>to back down from this because you&rsquo;re a little anxious or you&rsquo;re a little scared</p>
<p>or people might be looking at you? Are you really gonna back down? Are you</p>
<p>really going to let the judgment of other people stop you? Get fucking real.</p>
<p>Even if people are looking at you when you&rsquo;re at the gym, so what? And what about</p>
<p>it? My catchphrase bitch and what about it? Even if I do look fucking stupid when</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m doing a certain exercise, so what? So fucking what? It&rsquo;s not gonna stop me from</p>
<p>doing it because I want to look a certain way. I&rsquo;m doing what I need to do</p>
<p>to look the way I want to look. What the fuck do I care what you have to say or</p>
<p>what you think? Keep it to your goddamn self. And if people are sitting here</p>
<p>judging you, give it time because your efforts are going to show the results. So</p>
<p>people might look at you like oh they look fucking stupid and then a year</p>
<p>later you pop out looking ten times better than them. Yeah who looks stupid</p>
<p>now? Pretzel. That&rsquo;s why you all twisted and skinny and looking fucked up. I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>want to hear it. If you&rsquo;re going to the gym, you need to understand you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>there for other people. You&rsquo;re there for yourself. Like I said, you&rsquo;re going to do</p>
<p>a couple of movements. You&rsquo;re gonna go lift some shit up and put it down</p>
<p>because you want to look a certain way. And lifting that weight will help you</p>
<p>look that way. So go in and execute on what you know you need to do to hit the</p>
<p>desired outcome for the way that you want to look. Fuck everybody else.</p>
<p>Literally act like you&rsquo;re in your own world. I&rsquo;d be going to the gym with my</p>
<p>whole ass tripod and camera. You think I give a fuck? No. I used to get anxious</p>
<p>about it. Now? No. What are you gonna fucking say? Please try and say some</p>
<p>shit. Please. Let&rsquo;s argue while I&rsquo;m on camera because y&rsquo;all have always seen me</p>
<p>talk about shit and talk shit. Y&rsquo;all ain&rsquo;t live in action got to see me dog</p>
<p>cuss somebody the fuck out and I&rsquo;m so excited for it to happen because a lot</p>
<p>of people talk a big game on social media. I&rsquo;m with the shit bitch and a lot</p>
<p>of you know that. That&rsquo;s why nobody tries me in real life. But what? What the</p>
<p>fuck is somebody gonna say for me recording myself? That&rsquo;s why I get</p>
<p>millions of views on TikTok and you don&rsquo;t bitch. Shut the fuck up. Shut up.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I look better than you. And what? And what? Literally it&rsquo;s like when</p>
<p>I started my social media. People were looking at me and judging me like I was</p>
<p>fucking stupid. And two years later look where the fuck I&rsquo;m at now. 1.2 million</p>
<p>followers. Look who looks stupid now. You just didn&rsquo;t know what I was doing. You</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t understand what I was doing to get to the goal that I had and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>okay. People don&rsquo;t have to understand and that should not stop you. They don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>to fucking get it. The only person that has to get it is you. The only person who</p>
<p>has to execute is you. The only person that&rsquo;s gonna ever achieve your desires</p>
<p>is you. So if it doesn&rsquo;t make sense to others so fucking be it. Like when I do</p>
<p>lap pulldowns I do a certain exercise where like I&rsquo;m I do like normal lap</p>
<p>pulls and then to hit a certain area of your back I lean back like this. Or I lay</p>
<p>I literally like lay flat like this and then I&rsquo;ll like pull the bar because it</p>
<p>hits a different area of your back. And people look at me all the time like I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>fucking crazy. I don&rsquo;t give a fuck. Who has a big back? Me. I literally saw</p>
<p>Dallas McCarver do that exercise. He&rsquo;s like a triple set or whatever the</p>
<p>fuck it was with like three different movements with like leaning and shit. And</p>
<p>he looks huge. I think he was like an Olympian or something. But homeboy looks</p>
<p>good. Looked ten times better than me. So of course I&rsquo;m gonna take his fucking</p>
<p>advice. Why would I not? I&rsquo;m trying to look like that. But people do not have to</p>
<p>get what you&rsquo;re doing. Even if you look a goddamn goof. Even if you look a mess. Who</p>
<p>cares? Literally who cares? They don&rsquo;t have to get it. The only person that has</p>
<p>to get it is me and you. And I get it. I get all of it. And one more thing with</p>
<p>that is people who are experienced in the gym understand what certain</p>
<p>movements do. So the only people who are actually judging me for doing lat pull</p>
<p>downs laying flat are dumb motherfuckers who don&rsquo;t know what they&rsquo;re doing. They</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t actually know how to work out. They just see one way of doing something and</p>
<p>thinks that&rsquo;s the right way. People that are experienced get what I&rsquo;m doing. So</p>
<p>the only people who are gonna judge you are fucking uneducated. So I&rsquo;m gonna</p>
<p>throw that at you too. Okay so now I&rsquo;m gonna give you a couple of tips if you</p>
<p>have like an anxiety attack or you start panicking and how to walk yourself</p>
<p>through feeling anxious as fuck. Okay this is what&rsquo;s helped me. The only fucking</p>
<p>thing. But if you start getting worried or you get too in your head and you just</p>
<p>get overwhelmed. You&rsquo;re like oh my god I just want to fucking leave. Stop moving.</p>
<p>Stand still. And I want you to climb out of your head and kind of like observe</p>
<p>your body and observe what&rsquo;s going on at the gym. And like look at yourself from a</p>
<p>third person&rsquo;s view. Ask yourself what is happening? What the fuck&rsquo;s going on?</p>
<p>Look at yourself like a third person. Okay Leo is standing here getting ready</p>
<p>to do squats. There&rsquo;s people around doing their exercises. Everyone&rsquo;s just working</p>
<p>out in the gym. Does Leo look out of place? No. He&rsquo;s at the expected place to</p>
<p>be doing squats. It&rsquo;s not like you&rsquo;re at fucking Walmart doing goddamn squats.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re in the gym where you&rsquo;re supposed to be. You&rsquo;re in the squat rack. That&rsquo;s</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re supposed to be. Do your goddamn squats. Like if you start getting</p>
<p>anxious just literally start listing off like what is happening. I&rsquo;m feeling</p>
<p>anxious. I&rsquo;m standing here in the squat rack and I&rsquo;m getting ready to do my next</p>
<p>set. But I feel so fucking anxious and I want to leave. Literally speak it to</p>
<p>yourself in your mind what is going on and speak the situation at hand. Like</p>
<p>just say what it is. I&rsquo;m standing in the gym. I&rsquo;m standing in the squat rack. Just</p>
<p>fucking like I don&rsquo;t say verbally but like mentally. Mentally, verbally. Think</p>
<p>these thoughts. Like get situational. Bring it down to earth. What is the</p>
<p>scenario and what is the situation at hand and just start listing it. Because</p>
<p>it will make you realize it&rsquo;s not a big fucking deal. You&rsquo;re literally okay. You</p>
<p>are perfectly fine. You are not out of place. You&rsquo;re doing exactly what you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>supposed to be doing. You&rsquo;re feeling all these different things. But if you just</p>
<p>look at it objectively you look normal and you&rsquo;re doing everything fine. And</p>
<p>then I want you to step in and start comforting yourself. So that&rsquo;s a skill a</p>
<p>lot of people don&rsquo;t have. When they have a stimulus or they have something</p>
<p>uncomfortable they just run or they avoid it or they get away from it. Like a</p>
<p>lot of people will get to the gym, get too overwhelmed and then never come back.</p>
<p>Or they&rsquo;ll leave. Like girl, stand there in the stimulus and learn how to endure</p>
<p>it. Comfort yourself through it. Think of all the perspective shifts I gave you in</p>
<p>this. Put this episode on. I don&rsquo;t give a fuck. Do what you have to do to stay there.</p>
<p>But do not let yourself fucking just leave because you&rsquo;re uncomfortable. Girl,</p>
<p>like I said before, get fucking real. And also with comforting yourself. Comfort</p>
<p>yourself. Like things I say to myself is like, Leo, you&rsquo;re okay. You&rsquo;ve got this.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t look out of place. You belong. You&rsquo;re fine. You know how you look. You</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t look weird. Look at yourself in the mirror. Give yourself the reassurance</p>
<p>right now. Do you look weird? No. Do you know how to squat? Do you have proper</p>
<p>form? Yes. Literally look at yourself. Calm yourself down. Reassure yourself.</p>
<p>Touch your neck. That&rsquo;s something that I do a lot. Like I&rsquo;ll either like hold my</p>
<p>own hand or I&rsquo;ll like touch my hands and I touch my neck because it calms down</p>
<p>your central nervous system when you&rsquo;re stressed. It&rsquo;s like a little biological</p>
<p>response. You&rsquo;re welcome. But I&rsquo;ll literally touch my neck and she&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>Leo, you&rsquo;re okay. You got this. Nothing&rsquo;s wrong. You&rsquo;re feeling anxious. Totally</p>
<p>fine. But the situation at hand is not bigger than you think it is. You&rsquo;re okay.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got this. Okay, let&rsquo;s do it. And then you like coach yourself and comfort</p>
<p>yourself through it. It really just comes down to grabbing yourself by the</p>
<p>fucking nuts, dude. You just gotta grow the fuck up and like grab yourself by</p>
<p>the nuts. Are you gonna live your life running from things that make you feel</p>
<p>anxious? You&rsquo;ll never do anything. You&rsquo;ll never get anywhere. And I know that sucks</p>
<p>to hear but like wake the fuck up for a second. Like I&rsquo;m saying this because I</p>
<p>love you. I&rsquo;m saying this because this is what I needed to hear. Like me doing P90</p>
<p>X for a year, had I just gone to the gym and lifted for real, I would have</p>
<p>expedited my process. I would have looked ten times better in that six months or</p>
<p>however fucking long I did it. Like the six months that I was doing P90 X, had I</p>
<p>spent that time in the gym, I would have looked ten times better. But oh I was</p>
<p>anxious so I just didn&rsquo;t. Oh my god if I can go back and just smack the fuck out</p>
<p>of myself, I would. Like wake up kid. You got this. You&rsquo;re capable of so much more</p>
<p>than you think. You can handle it and it&rsquo;s not gonna be hard forever. You&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna learn ways to deal with it. You&rsquo;re gonna learn ways to get through it. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna get more comfortable. You just have to sit in it until it does. Don&rsquo;t run</p>
<p>from it. But if you do get overwhelmed and you do decide to leave, this is where</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna say you need to fucking choose it. And when I say choose it, this gets</p>
<p>deeper than oh I&rsquo;m just gonna leave or not leave. This gets to living a</p>
<p>powerless victim fucking mindset and I don&rsquo;t ever want you to be in that. I want</p>
<p>you to take control of your life and hold that fucking control. So what I want</p>
<p>you to do if you&rsquo;re gonna leave the gym, put it in your hands. Literally say I can</p>
<p>stay or I can choose to leave. And if you choose to leave, say to yourself I am</p>
<p>choosing to leave period. Do not fucking say I can&rsquo;t do this. I&rsquo;m overwhelmed. I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>scared. Don&rsquo;t say any of that. I can&rsquo;t handle it. Do not fucking speak that over</p>
<p>yourself. You are choosing not to handle it. You are choosing not to deal with it.</p>
<p>You are choosing not to rise to the occasion. So if you&rsquo;re going to do that,</p>
<p>choose it. Become aware it&rsquo;s a choice and then if you&rsquo;re still gonna leave, choose</p>
<p>to leave. But don&rsquo;t speak no limiting shit over yourself. Well I can&rsquo;t handle</p>
<p>this so I have to leave. You don&rsquo;t have to leave. I&rsquo;m choosing to leave because</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m overstimulated. That is more empowering than I just can&rsquo;t do it. I</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t handle it and leaving. You see the difference? So I want you to full</p>
<p>throttle fucking choose that shit. If you&rsquo;re gonna leave, choose it. Don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>convince yourself you can&rsquo;t handle it because you absolutely can. That&rsquo;s</p>
<p>fucking delusional thinking. And I&rsquo;m gonna save you from it because that will</p>
<p>do nothing but damage the shit out of yourself, your self-concept, and your</p>
<p>self-trust. Do not speak things like that over yourself. Like I said this comes</p>
<p>from a place of love and something that I wish someone would have told me a long</p>
<p>time ago. Because when you go home and you face the consequences of not working</p>
<p>toward your goals, you get to sit down and remind yourself, well I chose to</p>
<p>leave the gym the last four days. And you&rsquo;re not gonna be looking at it like,</p>
<p>oh my god I just couldn&rsquo;t do it. Like I&rsquo;ll try again tomorrow. Like and then</p>
<p>for four days it&rsquo;s like, oh you just convinced yourself you couldn&rsquo;t handle</p>
<p>it. You aren&rsquo;t strong enough. You chose not to be strong enough. You chose not to</p>
<p>become strong enough. You chose to not find ways to deal with it and continue</p>
<p>forward. But if you keep reminding yourself it&rsquo;s a choice. So for the last</p>
<p>four days I chose to go home because I was anxious. You&rsquo;re gonna get fed the</p>
<p>fuck up with yourself because the power&rsquo;s in your hands. You&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>realize, okay well I&rsquo;m choosing to fuck up my goals. I&rsquo;m choosing not to move</p>
<p>forward. I&rsquo;m choosing not to be consistent. And you&rsquo;re like, oh damn it</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t my control. So I&rsquo;m gonna choose to go back and I&rsquo;m gonna choose to stay</p>
<p>there this time. And what&rsquo;s gonna happen? You&rsquo;re gonna learn the way through it.</p>
<p>The only way out is through. Remember that? Love you. But basically my whole</p>
<p>little tangent about that is telling yourself you can&rsquo;t handle it is</p>
<p>validation that you&rsquo;re weak. You don&rsquo;t want to validate that about yourself.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s basically just you avoiding a situation that will make you stronger. So</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t do that. Okay so now let&rsquo;s jump into all the things for beginners because</p>
<p>I have a little list for you guys. So first thing is you&rsquo;re not expected to be</p>
<p>skilled and look like you know what you&rsquo;re doing. No one expects you to be</p>
<p>good at lifting. No one expects you to lift heavy. No one expects you to know</p>
<p>what the fuck you&rsquo;re doing and have like good form. No one is expecting that of</p>
<p>you. You&rsquo;re new bitch. It&rsquo;s unreasonable to expect that of yourself. It&rsquo;s like if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve never swam before. You&rsquo;re expecting yourself just to jump in the</p>
<p>water and look like a professional swimmer. That&rsquo;s not fucking realistic. You</p>
<p>have to jump in the water and learn to swim so you don&rsquo;t drown first. Then you</p>
<p>can work on perfecting your strokes. Then you can work on the form of a</p>
<p>professional swimmer. There are steps to it. You don&rsquo;t just walk in the gym a</p>
<p>hundred percent confident even though you know don&rsquo;t know what the fuck you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing and then all of a sudden just know what to do and know how to do everything.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of steps between that. So I just want to say you&rsquo;re not expected</p>
<p>to be perfect. You&rsquo;re not expected to be good yet and if you&rsquo;re not willing to</p>
<p>not be good at something, you will not get good at anything. You have to be</p>
<p>willing to suck and look new to look experienced. Is that the right words? Yeah</p>
<p>that makes sense. So the next thing I want to say for beginners is you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna be anxious going in the gym and I&rsquo;m gonna give you an analogy of going</p>
<p>to a fucking coffee shop. Just human behavior. When you&rsquo;re going into a</p>
<p>building you&rsquo;ve never been into before or you&rsquo;ve only been once and you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>really oriented with it, you&rsquo;re gonna be anxious. So like when you go into a new</p>
<p>coffee shop for the first time, every single human being is gonna get anxious.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t know who&rsquo;s behind the door. You don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s behind the door. You</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know the layout. You don&rsquo;t know anything. It&rsquo;s an unknown thing. So every</p>
<p>single human&rsquo;s body is gonna trigger anxiety. It&rsquo;s preparing for a threat in</p>
<p>case there is one. So it&rsquo;s not gonna be that crazy but a lot of people get</p>
<p>crippled by that like feeling of anxiety. But that&rsquo;s normal babe. You&rsquo;re walking</p>
<p>into an unknown place for the first time. Of course you&rsquo;re gonna be a little</p>
<p>anxious. Same thing applies to the gym. But when you walk in a coffee shop, what</p>
<p>the fuck do you do? You walk in and if you just stand there, you look like a</p>
<p>weirdo. You look out of place. You look like what the fuck. People are gonna look</p>
<p>at you if you just walk into a coffee shop and stand there or just play on</p>
<p>your phone. So like people that walk in the gym and just stand there or people</p>
<p>that walk in the gym and just sit there on their phone, people are looking at you</p>
<p>like huh? The expected thing to do when you walk into a coffee shop is to walk</p>
<p>up and get a coffee. That&rsquo;s what the baristas are expecting you to do. They&rsquo;re</p>
<p>there to take your order. They&rsquo;re expecting you to walk in and get a coffee</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re at a coffee shop. So the correct behavior to do is to walk up and</p>
<p>get a coffee, stand there and wait for it, get it, and then drink it or go the fuck</p>
<p>outside and go home. That&rsquo;s the expected thing to do. When you walk</p>
<p>into the gym, to work out is the expected thing to do. When you walk in and the</p>
<p>desk people, the front desk people say hi to you. Hi! Like the expected thing to do</p>
<p>when you go to the gym is to go work out. The expected thing at a coffee shop is</p>
<p>to get a coffee. Go fucking work out. You don&rsquo;t look weird. You don&rsquo;t look weird at</p>
<p>all and I want to give you that reassurance. It&rsquo;s weird to not work</p>
<p>out. So like I said, walking into a new place, you&rsquo;re gonna be anxious because</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t know your way around. You don&rsquo;t know what it&rsquo;s like. So with going</p>
<p>to a gym, if you&rsquo;re gonna sign up at a gym, go tour the gym. Go walk in and get</p>
<p>a tour from like the front desk people. Go tour the gym. See if you like it. See</p>
<p>if you like the vibe. And then before you ever work out at that gym, something I</p>
<p>used to do a lot is if I started at a new gym or started at a gym in general,</p>
<p>I usually started at something that was 24 hours so I could scan a key and go in</p>
<p>whenever I wanted. I would go really late at night like midnight 1 o&rsquo;clock because</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s like two or three fucking weirdos that go at that time. But go in</p>
<p>really fucking late one night and go look at the gym. Go find out where</p>
<p>everything is. Go get oriented to the gym. Find out where the bathrooms are, where</p>
<p>the cubbies are, where you can put your shit. Find out where to buy a snack and then</p>
<p>look at all the machines. Figure out where all the machines are. Gyms are</p>
<p>typically set up, there&rsquo;s like a chest section, back, legs. Figure out where all</p>
<p>the machines are and go play on all of them. Literally go play on all the</p>
<p>fucking machines to get comfortable with using them. Like there&rsquo;s little</p>
<p>pictures on most machines, just look at them, follow the picture, learn how to</p>
<p>move this seat around, learn how to adjust like everything about the machine</p>
<p>and then play on every single one. So you know where everything&rsquo;s at one, but two</p>
<p>you know how to use them. So when you go into the gym the next day at a time when</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s people there, you already know what the gym looks like, you already know</p>
<p>where everything&rsquo;s at, you already know how to adjust and move all the seats, you</p>
<p>already know how to use everything, you don&rsquo;t have to go through the fear of</p>
<p>worrying about people looking at you and also not knowing what the fuck you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing. You know what you&rsquo;re doing and like I said the more you prepare the</p>
<p>more confident you feel. So that&rsquo;s a really big tip that I have is like just</p>
<p>go play on all the machines and go learn the gym before anyone&rsquo;s there. Like just</p>
<p>go when it&rsquo;s really fucking late, go finger fuck everything, go play on</p>
<p>everything and like figure out how to use it and it will make you so much more</p>
<p>comfortable. The more time you spend in that location, the more comfortable you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>feel. So go spend time there when there&rsquo;s less pressure from like a lot of people</p>
<p>being there also. So another tip that I have if you have the money to do it is</p>
<p>hire a personal trainer for a month. Just one month. You don&rsquo;t need a trainer</p>
<p>forever. Like literally hire a trainer and fucking use them for what they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>worth. Have them take you to the gym and teach you how to use everything. You&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>be working out with someone. You&rsquo;ll learn exercises, you&rsquo;ll learn forms, you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>learn what exercises go together, you&rsquo;ll learn how to do an arm day, a leg day, a</p>
<p>back day, a chest day. You&rsquo;ll learn how to do all these days. You&rsquo;ll learn what</p>
<p>proper sets look like. You&rsquo;ll learn what proper like amount of exercises are and</p>
<p>you have kind of like a guide with you to help you through it all and people</p>
<p>that will check your form. Like they&rsquo;re gonna help make sure you don&rsquo;t look</p>
<p>stupid and that you&rsquo;re doing things properly. So get a trainer for a month. It</p>
<p>only takes a month to fucking learn everything max. You can learn that shit</p>
<p>in two weeks. Just go consistent with the trainer. Learn as much as you can. Get</p>
<p>comfortable with all of it. Absorb all the knowledge and then go on your</p>
<p>fucking own. It&rsquo;s not that hard but having the trainer for the first little</p>
<p>bit is really really helpful and it will calm a lot of your anxiety. It will teach</p>
<p>you a lot because you can only learn so much before you start doing it. So like</p>
<p>if you try and look up YouTube videos and look up shit online, sure you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>learning a lot. You&rsquo;re consuming a lot. You&rsquo;re not actually learning how to</p>
<p>execute and do things. So by going with a trainer you&rsquo;ll be learning by doing. So</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna learn by working out not by like researching shit. Like you should</p>
<p>research things and learn the things that you want to learn for the things</p>
<p>that you want to achieve. But going with a trainer will help like expedite the</p>
<p>process but also be researching on the back end and like throw some shit in</p>
<p>that you want to do. But with that look up exercises that you want to do at home.</p>
<p>Like look them up before you ever go to the gym and practice them. Literally get</p>
<p>in your bedroom and fucking practice the exercises you want to do. Get in front of</p>
<p>a mirror and practice. If you want to learn how to do squats look up videos</p>
<p>about how to do a squat and then practice the movement in your room. If</p>
<p>you want to do a little kickback, if you want to do a deadlift, whatever you want</p>
<p>to do. Practice just the movement of the exercise that you want to do in your</p>
<p>house where you&rsquo;re safe alone. You&rsquo;re allowed to look stupid and not care.</p>
<p>Learn the basic skills of how to execute these movements so that you&rsquo;re less</p>
<p>anxious when you go to the gym. Like this will help you a ton. Just getting</p>
<p>comfortable with certain movements before you go. Like how I started with P90X.</p>
<p>I learned how to do a lot of movements before I ever stepped foot in the gym. So</p>
<p>when I went to the gym it was a lot easier. And then when you&rsquo;re at the gym</p>
<p>use the mirrors. Like the mirrors are there for you to look at your fucking</p>
<p>self. Like who gives a fuck if people see you looking at yourself in a mirror. Use</p>
<p>the mirrors to check your form and correct yourself. If something feels off</p>
<p>and it feels weird and you feel like you look awkward, look at yourself in the</p>
<p>mirror. If you look fucking weird, fix what you&rsquo;re doing. Do something different</p>
<p>and check yourself so that you&rsquo;re more confident doing the exercises. You don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>want to just nervously like oh just do something and like knock out the</p>
<p>exercise. Because then it&rsquo;s gonna be miserable and you&rsquo;re not gonna want to</p>
<p>do it. Look in the mirror, make sure you look right, change what you need to</p>
<p>change, and then you won&rsquo;t be as hesitant to do the next few sets. You&rsquo;ll be</p>
<p>excited. You&rsquo;ll be like oh hell yeah I got this. I look cute doing this one</p>
<p>actually. And then you&rsquo;ll like knock out some little tricep extensions. But</p>
<p>literally just use the mirrors to fix yourself. Use the mirrors to check</p>
<p>yourself in your form and to reassure yourself. Okay if I feel like I look</p>
<p>fucking weird, do I? Okay no I don&rsquo;t. I look fine. I&rsquo;ll keep doing it. If I do</p>
<p>feel like I look weird and I do look fucking weird because I looked in the</p>
<p>mirror, then change it. Fix it until you feel comfortable. So my next tip for</p>
<p>beginners is go in with a game plan. So if you are gonna go in by yourself, just</p>
<p>go in with kind of like a game plan. Like research and look up online like some</p>
<p>workouts and exercises you can do and like little workout routines. And go in</p>
<p>with a list of exercises that you can do. Practice them before you go in like I</p>
<p>said. And then when you go to the gym, having some sort of game plan will make</p>
<p>you feel better and like guided. So you&rsquo;ll feel a little bit more supported</p>
<p>because you have something that you&rsquo;re doing. It&rsquo;s not like oh I&rsquo;m just focusing</p>
<p>on like what am I gonna do. It&rsquo;s already decided for you. You don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>to deal with making a decision. It&rsquo;s like okay I finished this thing. Now I go to</p>
<p>this machine. And then you go to it. Having a little game plan will alleviate</p>
<p>a lot of anxiety and also if you follow someone&rsquo;s workout plan that looks really</p>
<p>fucking good, you&rsquo;re gonna feel more confident doing these exercises even if</p>
<p>you look stupid. Because clearly it works. If they&rsquo;re hot as fuck and they be doing</p>
<p>the shit, here I go I&rsquo;m gonna be doing shit. But it makes it less about you and</p>
<p>you worrying that other people are judging you because you decided to do</p>
<p>something. And it takes that away and makes it like okay I&rsquo;m doing the</p>
<p>exercise because this is what so-and-so told me to do online that looks like a</p>
<p>fucking model. Like I&rsquo;m gonna do that. And it takes the pressure off you kind of.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s not your decision. It&rsquo;s theirs. You&rsquo;re just like doing as you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>told to look that way. So my last tip for beginners is stick with machines until</p>
<p>you feel confident in the gym and you&rsquo;re comfortable with everything to go to</p>
<p>like free weight movements. You can still get a really good workout with just</p>
<p>machines. A lot of people do that. But don&rsquo;t let it stress you out. If going to</p>
<p>do squats or going to use dumbbells or like a barbell is stressful to you, don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>do it yet. Like I said practice at home. Practice your form. Get comfortable just</p>
<p>being in the gym at first. Go do your machines. Have everything that&rsquo;s kind of</p>
<p>like there to help you because you can look at the thing and read how to do it.</p>
<p>Literally stick to the machines until you feel more comfortable. And then you</p>
<p>can start branching out and trying other things. But something is better than</p>
<p>nothing. So even if you go to the gym and only do machine exercises, something&rsquo;s</p>
<p>better than nothing. And I&rsquo;m fucking proud of you. This was a lot of fucking</p>
<p>gym tips. If these helped you, leave me a comment and let me know. And leave this</p>
<p>video a thumbs up. And if you&rsquo;re listening to the audio version of this,</p>
<p>leave me five stars. And if you know anybody that also struggles with gym</p>
<p>anxiety or a beginner and they want to start working out, send them this video</p>
<p>if you think it&rsquo;ll be helpful. But that&rsquo;s all I got for this episode. I hope you</p>
<p>guys learned a lot. And I hope you got the kick in the ass that you needed. And</p>
<p>I hope some of these perspective shifts will allow you to feel more comfortable.</p>
<p>That was my goal behind all this. All of my social media and everywhere you can</p>
<p>keep up with me will be in the description. If you&rsquo;re interested in</p>
<p>getting my merch, I just restocked it a couple days ago and we&rsquo;re already at</p>
<p>like a thousand and seventy orders. It&rsquo;s like a day and a half. I&rsquo;m like what the</p>
<p>fuck. So I don&rsquo;t know when it&rsquo;s gonna sell out. But the link for that will be</p>
<p>in the description also. So go shop if you want something. And until next week,</p>
<p>get your fucking ass in the gym bitch. You got this. You fucking got this. Just</p>
<p>put this episode on and just listen to it while you&rsquo;re at the gym. We could be like</p>
<p>little gym friends. I&rsquo;ll just be in your ear yelling at you. But everybody take</p>
<p>care of yourself. Be safe. And I will talk to you guys next Sunday.</p>
