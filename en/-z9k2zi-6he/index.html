<p>become addicted to all these great</p>
<p>questions that you come up with an</p>
<p>audience I don&rsquo;t know the answer either</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m really excited so uh why don&rsquo;t we</p>
<p>kick off with one of those this week and</p>
<p>Dr Berg here&rsquo;s the first fascinating</p>
<p>question</p>
<p>all right so let me just pull this up</p>
<p>right here okay why does the lens of the</p>
<p>eye</p>
<p>not have blood vessels</p>
<p>and by the way it also doesn&rsquo;t have a</p>
<p>lymphatic system so why is that wow how</p>
<p>does it stay alive for goodness sakes</p>
<p>that sounds so strange okay why don&rsquo;t we</p>
<p>jump right over to social media because</p>
<p>we love them as well and a v-not from</p>
<p>YouTube Kicks it off with what are your</p>
<p>thoughts about human consumption of cow</p>
<p>or Buffalo milk as by Nature it&rsquo;s only</p>
<p>suitable for Animals by Nature it&rsquo;s only</p>
<p>suitable for Animals what do you think</p>
<p>about those</p>
<p>thing well I mean I think the real</p>
<p>important thing way more important and</p>
<p>that is um if it&rsquo;s Raw versus</p>
<p>pasteurized because the pasteurization</p>
<p>you know they</p>
<p>we have a calf uh that was just born</p>
<p>from a cow that was just too small and</p>
<p>there was a lot of problems in fact to</p>
<p>the point where the mother is not</p>
<p>feeding the calf so we have to bottle</p>
<p>feed it so I&rsquo;ve done some research on um</p>
<p>the pasteurization of milk even in</p>
<p>calves versus raw milk a huge difference</p>
<p>in organs like the color of your organs</p>
<p>the the health of your body so if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna um do milk I would definitely go</p>
<p>raw I would I prefer to have some milk</p>
<p>in a fermented product like a cheese raw</p>
<p>cheese maybe kefir</p>
<p>um that type of thing that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>usually better but some people are</p>
<p>sensitive to milk</p>
<p>um they have allergies and there is a</p>
<p>little bit of sugar in milk so that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>another problem</p>
<p>um but um</p>
<p>so what what is how does that relate to</p>
<p>humans</p>
<p>um definitely if you&rsquo;re if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>pregnant or lactating</p>
<p>um well of course if you&rsquo;re pregnant</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re deciding to if you&rsquo;re on the edge</p>
<p>about breastfeeding I would definitely</p>
<p>go that route because I would think and</p>
<p>this is just my own opinion that uh uh</p>
<p>the pasteurization is very going to be</p>
<p>similar to the uh some of the formulas</p>
<p>that they put out there that I could</p>
<p>only imagine what that does to our</p>
<p>bodies wow well I currently in my little</p>
<p>uh glass next to me I have my famous ice</p>
<p>a cold brew coffee and I put 100 heavy</p>
<p>cream in it and it&rsquo;s so delicious now I</p>
<p>know it&rsquo;s probably pasteurized and all</p>
<p>that but uh it&rsquo;s not making me fat you</p>
<p>know not and just keep the sugar out and</p>
<p>um you know I think I think if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>just doing you know like in your coffee</p>
<p>creamers that&rsquo;s what I do I mean it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>really hard to find raw cream but um</p>
<p>but the point is that if you&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>be drinking</p>
<p>a good amount of milk um definitely make</p>
<p>sure it&rsquo;s raw not pasteurized</p>
<p>very good emo from YouTube just like so</p>
<p>many others I just had my gallbladder</p>
<p>removed what supplements should I take</p>
<p>for a fatty liver and loss of a</p>
<p>gallbladder he&rsquo;s mourning the</p>
<p>gallbladder already please write out</p>
<p>your answer as I am deaf oh that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>interesting thank you for all of your</p>
<p>work and I don&rsquo;t know if you can you</p>
<p>know in between some things here maybe</p>
<p>type it into our little chat or no he</p>
<p>won&rsquo;t see that I&rsquo;m sorry anyway we&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>make sure that your question gets</p>
<p>answered and thanks for participating uh</p>
<p>even sand here maybe maybe</p>
<p>um maybe someone on our team can type in</p>
<p>the answer but is choline choline is</p>
<p>what you want to do if you have a fatty</p>
<p>liver and as well as some bile salts</p>
<p>start taking bio cells because one of</p>
<p>the big purposes of a gallbladder is to</p>
<p>concentrate the bile and so not just</p>
<p>store it um just for release when you</p>
<p>eat but concentrate so now you don&rsquo;t get</p>
<p>that concentration so now we have this</p>
<p>bile that&rsquo;s not as strong and and so how</p>
<p>is that going to affect the extraction</p>
<p>of those fat soluble nutrients well I</p>
<p>think it could affect it especially long</p>
<p>term</p>
<p>very good give me just a moment I am</p>
<p>typing it on spellcholine for me Doc</p>
<p>ch</p>
<p>l o now it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>c-h-o-l-i-n-e I guess put you on the</p>
<p>spot David let&rsquo;s see here uh</p>
<p>cold we have to write it out um exactly</p>
<p>all right there you go l-i-n-e uh</p>
<p>chlorine don&rsquo;t do that don&rsquo;t take that</p>
<p>no audience help me out here would you</p>
<p>put emo this is where the audience comes</p>
<p>in don&rsquo;t listen to Steve it&rsquo;s choline I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t want him gulping any chlorine so</p>
<p>help us out there let&rsquo;s see uh open but</p>
<p>Patty instead of typing the answer let</p>
<p>me get to her question on YouTube our</p>
<p>ice bath good for you what are your</p>
<p>thoughts and audience don&rsquo;t forget to</p>
<p>correct me here emo tell them it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>choline okay what do you think about</p>
<p>Patty&rsquo;s question yeah the ice baths are</p>
<p>very therapeutic</p>
<p>um even though they&rsquo;re very</p>
<p>uncomfortable especially in the winter</p>
<p>for some reason but if you can withstand</p>
<p>that and by the way if you have if you</p>
<p>want to increase your tolerance to that</p>
<p>B1 can help you because if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>deficient in B1 your tolerance goes down</p>
<p>for stress all stress</p>
<p>um not just</p>
<p>um you know</p>
<p>slow drivers but also</p>
<p>temperature</p>
<p>gradients like if it&rsquo;s too cold or too</p>
<p>hot</p>
<p>um so yes I think that&rsquo;s very</p>
<p>therapeutic if you could do it boy that</p>
<p>that would really drop your inflammation</p>
<p>increase your cognitive function so</p>
<p>um find a nice Pond you can jump into in</p>
<p>the winter and or just a nice bath and</p>
<p>um experience the therapeutic benefits</p>
<p>of that or you can just take a cold</p>
<p>shower how about that I&rsquo;ve done videos</p>
<p>on that oh yeah that&rsquo;s terrific that&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>get you up and at them okay why don&rsquo;t we</p>
<p>go to the green room and our first</p>
<p>participant is guy who is in Colorado</p>
<p>but originally from Israel and uh he has</p>
<p>a one question for you uh and go ahead</p>
<p>with your question you&rsquo;re on with Dr</p>
<p>Berg guy</p>
<p>good morning and</p>
<p>[Music]</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>[Music]</p>
<p>[Music]</p>
<p>remember</p>
<p>[Music]</p>
<p>so and this is the black history</p>
<p>my question is</p>
<p>it really depends on one thing and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s calories how much of it and I</p>
<p>think that amount is going to vary it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to affect you in a very tiny way</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s going to be a very um small so I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t think I would worry about it I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t I think it&rsquo;s a small Point um I</p>
<p>think you&rsquo;re still going to get the</p>
<p>massive benefits even even for example</p>
<p>um you know you have this fasting window</p>
<p>and you have this eating window let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>say you&rsquo;re eating between 12 and 6.</p>
<p>um some people have this idea that wow</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just gonna I could eat anything I</p>
<p>want right through the eating window and</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re snacking and all this other</p>
<p>stuff well if you don&rsquo;t do that you get</p>
<p>a nice little drop in insulin so I just</p>
<p>recommend don&rsquo;t snack through the eating</p>
<p>window but yeah I think it&rsquo;s a minor</p>
<p>point I think you&rsquo;re going to be fine</p>
<p>thank you I actually don&rsquo;t I I eat lunch</p>
<p>and then because the intermittent</p>
<p>fasting got me to I really don&rsquo;t need</p>
<p>anything between lunch and dinner I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t like to I don&rsquo;t feel hungry great</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s awesome</p>
<p>yeah I I remember I remember I used to</p>
<p>be so hungry in the morning now it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t I don&rsquo;t I don&rsquo;t it&rsquo;s like it</p>
<p>just repels them like I don&rsquo;t want any</p>
<p>food</p>
<p>um so it&rsquo;s yeah it definitely does work</p>
<p>once you get your body fat adapted boy</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s incredible well thank you so much</p>
<p>guy uh for coming on with us we</p>
<p>appreciate it sorry for the echo folks</p>
<p>uh one of my co-producers slapped me on</p>
<p>the back of the head and said fix that</p>
<p>so guys final comments were Echo free</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s move on by the way I&rsquo;m going</p>
<p>to admonish the audience I think we</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t get any answers for question</p>
<p>number one let me repeat that for you</p>
<p>audience why does the lens of the eye</p>
<p>have and not have any blood vessels</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s look at that folks and if you give</p>
<p>it another shot you might be trying you</p>
<p>probably were trying to save emo from my</p>
<p>chlorine recommendation and typing that</p>
<p>and I hope that&rsquo;s the reason but</p>
<p>audience please get back to that because</p>
<p>we love your participation well it could</p>
<p>be because they you know it&rsquo;s it might</p>
<p>be a hard question to answer so should I</p>
<p>just give the answer yeah why not folks</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m if you had blood vessels</p>
<p>you would then see them and that would</p>
<p>obstruct your vision</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>we had to develop a lens that you that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>transparent that you wouldn&rsquo;t you blood</p>
<p>vessels and blood are not transparent so</p>
<p>they would always leave a little filter</p>
<p>on there</p>
<p>um so</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s this very very fascinating type</p>
<p>of protein</p>
<p>that is um so this insoluble</p>
<p>fiber protein inside your eye and inside</p>
<p>the lens that allows you allows it to be</p>
<p>transparent and um there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s a lot</p>
<p>of other unique things about this lens</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m going to share with you in a</p>
<p>video but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an incredible piece of physiology</p>
<p>in Biochemistry that um</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just amazing when you really learn</p>
<p>about what this lens is and then what</p>
<p>type of problems you can happen</p>
<p>when you start getting like glaucoma or</p>
<p>oxnical coma cataracts and we&rsquo;ll talk</p>
<p>about that in a near future</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>video but um</p>
<p>but boy the uh that lens of eye that</p>
<p>lens of your eye is very very rugged and</p>
<p>the immune system is very unique in the</p>
<p>eye so if you were to get a um</p>
<p>infection or some a transplant of the</p>
<p>lens and your body would not reject it</p>
<p>compared to other organs it would so</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s definitely this um unique uh</p>
<p>immune system that is separate from the</p>
<p>rest of the body because</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>you know that would that would be a</p>
<p>problem if you&rsquo;re if your eye once that</p>
<p>lens goes you know you can&rsquo;t see you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not going to survive too well so there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a lot of built-in things into this lens</p>
<p>that helps you continue to see despite a</p>
<p>lot of problems I mean how many times</p>
<p>Steve have you ever like um I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>walk through the woods and have a branch</p>
<p>hit you in the eye or get punched in the</p>
<p>eye and and somehow you still could see</p>
<p>I mean it&rsquo;s just amazing or you get a</p>
<p>scratch on the eye</p>
<p>um it&rsquo;s amazing that that lens can take</p>
<p>a beating but it keeps working well you</p>
<p>had to ask doc because when I was at</p>
<p>this teenage dance back in the 60s uh</p>
<p>there was an I-beam with a little hole</p>
<p>in it and I was looking through it and</p>
<p>told some guy oh yeah I can see and by</p>
<p>the way this dates me you could smoke</p>
<p>kids could bring cigarettes into the</p>
<p>little dance the whole church Auditorium</p>
<p>was filled with smoke and he stuck the</p>
<p>cigarette through the hole straight into</p>
<p>my eye</p>
<p>a red hot cigarette suddenly the lights</p>
<p>came up the bands stopped the emergency</p>
<p>Squad got there and they put this Salve</p>
<p>or something in my eye and the next day</p>
<p>I could see again because it didn&rsquo;t come</p>
<p>I was gray all I could see was would</p>
<p>blurred gray because it burnt the I</p>
<p>guess the cornea or the lens or whatever</p>
<p>it was but they the doc said that is the</p>
<p>fastest healing tissue in your body and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why you were able to in in</p>
<p>whatever that was 24 hours able to see</p>
<p>again but that&rsquo;s scary</p>
<p>um and uh I don&rsquo;t know whatever became</p>
<p>of the genius that stuck the cigarette</p>
<p>through the thing but the chaos was so</p>
<p>immediate he got lost in the crowd</p>
<p>giggling away or whatever awful thing he</p>
<p>did but anyway so I agree with you</p>
<p>instead of a stick in the eye had a</p>
<p>cigarette in the eye and I&rsquo;ve still got</p>
<p>great vision these many years later so</p>
<p>thank you</p>
<p>um nature for doing that for me that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>fantastic and now let&rsquo;s get me here I</p>
<p>hate when that happens oh I do too are</p>
<p>you okay let&rsquo;s see let&rsquo;s go back to</p>
<p>social media social media excuse me</p>
<p>Sarita</p>
<p>from YouTube I am new to keto but having</p>
<p>trouble Breaking Free of grains in my</p>
<p>diet what suggestions do you offer some</p>
<p>sort of corporal punishment</p>
<p>yeah grains definitely are highly</p>
<p>addictive I think the best way is just</p>
<p>to understand more of a understanding of</p>
<p>what grains really are you&rsquo;re eating a</p>
<p>lot of concentrated seeds our bodies</p>
<p>naturally are not designed to eat a lot</p>
<p>of concentrated seeds that have they</p>
<p>come with a package they come with</p>
<p>anti-nutrients they come with uh gluten</p>
<p>that is the only protein that we can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>digest they come with um</p>
<p>weight gain and increased insulin</p>
<p>resistance I think a better approach</p>
<p>would be to definitely eat those grains</p>
<p>but in a different form like maybe you</p>
<p>sprout them for a week or two weeks and</p>
<p>then eat the baby micro greens now</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re now you&rsquo;re gonna actually uh</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna be able to digest them</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not going to bother you of</p>
<p>course they don&rsquo;t quite taste like the</p>
<p>bread pasta cereal crackers biscuits</p>
<p>type thing but the other option would be</p>
<p>to look up some of the recipes on our</p>
<p>website on the grain substitutes there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a wonderful almond flour there&rsquo;s other</p>
<p>types of uh Alternatives that you can</p>
<p>make for your your cookies candies</p>
<p>Breads and pasta and pizza crust</p>
<p>wonderful okay Scott from elbow</p>
<p>Melbourne Australia would like a</p>
<p>chemistry lesson he said I just</p>
<p>purchased Xylitol and grapefruit seed</p>
<p>extract as you recommended for sinus</p>
<p>care what is the recipe for the spray</p>
<p>and he thanks you</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>what I recommend to do is recommend is</p>
<p>you basically take a um a half a glass</p>
<p>of water warm water and you dissolve</p>
<p>about one one teaspoon of Xylitol okay</p>
<p>and just like two or three drops of that</p>
<p>grape seed extract and um that&rsquo;s all you</p>
<p>need</p>
<p>terrific go for it okay speaking of uh</p>
<p>places other than the contiguous U.S</p>
<p>even though these people aren&rsquo;t</p>

<p>joining in now answer the questions for</p>
<p>goodness sakes Laura from Facebook can</p>
<p>there be pain associated with a liver</p>
<p>cleanse I&rsquo;ve been having lower back pain</p>
<p>and hip pain since cleansing my liver I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know if she&rsquo;s cleansing it with</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s all sorts of detoxes</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve done before that put me in a</p>
<p>bunch of hurt I&rsquo;m talking about a detox</p>
<p>like inflammation they can stir up</p>
<p>inflammatory things because you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re releasing things from the cells</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re releasing things that can</p>
<p>affect</p>
<p>um the liver and definitely definitely</p>
<p>stir up an immune reaction that can show</p>
<p>up in kind of weak links especially your</p>
<p>lower back what you could do is you can</p>
<p>do a couple things you could take but</p>
<p>bentonite clay</p>
<p>or activated charcoal to kind of soak up</p>
<p>some of those toxins to see if see if</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t resolve it and then let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>say that doesn&rsquo;t resolve it then</p>
<p>I always as my go-to for lower back pain</p>
<p>is take more vitamin D D3 and take</p>
<p>twenty thousand IUS maybe thirty</p>
<p>thousand and that usually will knock it</p>
<p>knock it out of the ballpark unless</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some other reason why you have</p>
<p>low back pain</p>
<p>you know so but a state coincidence with</p>
<p>this detox so I&rsquo;ll start with uh</p>
<p>things that those things like to help</p>
<p>soak up the toxic material very good</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s go back to the Green Room this</p>
<p>time with Ava who is calling in from</p>
<p>Oregon it rains there all the time go</p>
<p>ahead Ava</p>
<p>without uh sodium I have so much trouble</p>
<p>with salt I even take I&rsquo;m doing keto I</p>
<p>take low</p>
<p>sodium electrolytes I don&rsquo;t like salt I</p>
<p>rarely use it when I cook but I have so</p>
<p>much trouble with swollen ankles</p>
<p>and lower legs it&rsquo;s a real problem I had</p>
<p>a TIA December 16th very little deficit</p>
<p>and um</p>
<p>I have a heart monitor on right now and</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t know what to do about the</p>
<p>sodium it eliminates a lot of products I</p>
<p>can buy because I always check the</p>
<p>sodium levels</p>
<p>Sky High</p>
<p>so so I think we&rsquo;ve probably put you in</p>
<p>the category of like sodium sensitive or</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re more sensitive to sodium and</p>
<p>um you should be but the point is that</p>
<p>the the best way to do that and because</p>
<p>you could only go so far with sodium I</p>
<p>mean we need at least like over 2 000</p>
<p>milligrams per day for various reasons</p>
<p>building</p>
<p>um hydrochloric acid in your stomach I</p>
<p>mean we need sodium to a certain degree</p>
<p>um so the the solution is to start</p>
<p>increasing your potassium levels higher</p>
<p>and higher because that will offset and</p>
<p>protect you against those symptoms that</p>
<p>are occurring from</p>
<p>sodium and so that will also push the</p>
<p>fluid out so whatever you&rsquo;re taking</p>
<p>start increasing more potassium but that</p>
<p>is the solution and then of course</p>
<p>realize that those these minerals also</p>
<p>work especially when we&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>electrolytes you may need a little bit</p>
<p>magnesium as well but I would definitely</p>
<p>increase more potassium have you been</p>
<p>doing that already</p>
<p>yes but I&rsquo;m not sure how much to take of</p>
<p>the potassium like for example the</p>
<p>potassium electrolyte I have has a</p>
<p>thousand milligrams so I would probably</p>
<p>do two maybe even three a day scoops of</p>
<p>that and then have more like bigger</p>
<p>salads as well because of course the</p>
<p>salad has the high potassium and low</p>
<p>sodium</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>if you want to get even more potassium</p>
<p>make your salads with the micro greens</p>
<p>that&rsquo;ll just really spike your potassium</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s very low sodium and I think</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll feel better once that is is</p>
<p>working better but um there&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>in your body called the</p>
<p>sodium potassium pump and it&rsquo;s in every</p>
<p>single cell</p>
<p>you know</p>
<p>you so we definitely wanted we</p>
<p>definitely want the sodium but we got to</p>
<p>get the right ratios going on with more</p>
<p>potassium and I think after maybe two or</p>
<p>three weeks of having more potassium</p>
<p>things will balance out real nicely and</p>
<p>your fluid will actually do better as</p>
<p>well</p>
<p>so you mentioned a liquid potassium as</p>
<p>opposed to I have to supplement capsules</p>
<p>um so um what milligram does your</p>
<p>supplement come in with the potassium</p>
<p>because</p>
<p>they only sell it in like 99 milligrams</p>
<p>and so um there&rsquo;s one that I recommend</p>
<p>my electrolyte powder that comes in a</p>
<p>thousand milligrams so that would be a</p>
<p>lot easier than taking uh 10 of those</p>
<p>pills a day three times a day</p>
<p>yeah Dr Berg&rsquo;s formula is yummy you</p>
<p>won&rsquo;t have to choke it down</p>
<p>the electrolyte count no it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>very low in salt it&rsquo;s very high in</p>
<p>potassium</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>now of course don&rsquo;t get the sport</p>
<p>electrolyte one just get the regular one</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a very very small amount it</p>
<p>just it still has some</p>
<p>um but it definitely def the the</p>
<p>potassium far outweighs that a little</p>
<p>bit of tiny potassium</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry a little bit of sodium that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>great well listen thank you so much Ava</p>
<p>we appreciate you coming on and we hope</p>
<p>your ankles shrink down to a lovely</p>
<p>level and we&rsquo;d love to hear back from</p>
<p>you to see how how things are</p>
<p>progressing with you uh let&rsquo;s see</p>
<p>um not to be outdone this happens very</p>
<p>often the shout out some people got very</p>
<p>jealous because they didn&rsquo;t chime in yet</p>
<p>and they include Pakistan the Congo</p>
<p>Ireland Morocco Ecuador Haiti Brazil</p>
<p>Romania and India that&rsquo;s a big place</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t want to forget them so thank you</p>
<p>all so much for watching I think we have</p>
<p>uh maybe a strike on hand I don&rsquo;t see</p>
<p>Terry the answers to question number two</p>
<p>or did we bring that up doc I&rsquo;m not sure</p>
<p>if we did</p>
<p>um I don&rsquo;t think we I don&rsquo;t think we did</p>
<p>well then they&rsquo;re forgiven here you go</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s go let&rsquo;s ask another question okay</p>
<p>all right so the most important vitamin</p>
<p>in preventing acne is fill in the blank</p>
<p>sorry for accusing you of not</p>
<p>participating audience my humble</p>
<p>apologies speaking of the audience uh L</p>
<p>from YouTube I&rsquo;ve been diagnosed with a</p>
<p>connective tissue disease it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>rheumatoid arthritis though any</p>
<p>recommendations for a natural way to</p>
<p>treat this Condition it&rsquo;s not a lot of</p>
<p>information but what do you think doc</p>
<p>yeah of course I don&rsquo;t know your</p>
<p>genetics but I do I will say that</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s definitely several genetic</p>
<p>problems even</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>variations of your genes that can give</p>
<p>you weak weak collagen and connective</p>
<p>tissue in which case you want to make</p>
<p>sure that you don&rsquo;t over train</p>
<p>with exercise you want to make sure you</p>
<p>want to recover probably bone broth</p>
<p>would be a really good and also collagen</p>
<p>powder would be a good thing to take as</p>
<p>well as the vitamin C but make sure the</p>
<p>vitamin C is in the whole form coming</p>
<p>from food because you need Vitamin C as</p>
<p>a co-helper for the collagen</p>
<p>very good okay now this doesn&rsquo;t require</p>
<p>an answer from you doc but it does</p>
<p>require a bell ring because Beth Ann</p>
<p>from Facebook I&rsquo;ve been on your Healthy</p>
<p>keto plant since October and have lost</p>
<p>27 Pounders thank you so much he says so</p>
<p>good for you Beth doesn&rsquo;t that feel</p>
<p>fantastic</p>
<p>uh let&rsquo;s move on let&rsquo;s see uh Poonam</p>
<p>from Singapore on Facebook my 21 year</p>
<p>old daughter has very bad cramps during</p>
<p>her period her gynecologist has only</p>
<p>remected only recommended painkillers</p>
<p>help</p>
<p>so think about what a cramp is</p>
<p>definitely any cramp uh you&rsquo;re the</p>
<p>muscle is over</p>
<p>um over Contracting there&rsquo;s a couple</p>
<p>quick things I would do because if you</p>
<p>look at what causes relaxation in a</p>
<p>muscle it&rsquo;s magnesium magnesium and also</p>
<p>potassium so if they take a little bit</p>
<p>more magnesium and sometimes they have</p>
<p>to add it with calcium because it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>just about the relaxation you need that</p>
<p>whole contraction relaxation that a lot</p>
<p>of times will get rid of the cramps</p>
<p>definitely a little bit before your um</p>
<p>your menstrual period</p>
<p>and uh so why would you get that in the</p>
<p>first place well it could be that you</p>
<p>have a subclinical problem with these</p>
<p>with magnesium and you&rsquo;re going into</p>
<p>this and everything is magnified during</p>
<p>the cycle but you know the uterus is</p>
<p>cramping and so it&rsquo;s very simply we need</p>
<p>to take that cramp out</p>
<p>um just like you would if you had a leg</p>
<p>cramp</p>
<p>very good okay well the audience is made</p>
<p>up uh for the first question with the</p>
<p>lightning fans fast answer to the second</p>
<p>one which has the most important vitamin</p>
<p>in preventing acne is drum roll please</p>
<p>55 of our respondents say zinc 30 say</p>
<p>vitamin A 10 say vitamin D and the last</p>
<p>five percent say vitamin E who&rsquo;s right</p>
<p>the vitamin D category now you&rsquo;re all</p>
<p>right it&rsquo;s zinc is going to be important</p>
<p>and vitamin A is going to be important</p>
<p>but what is even more important is this</p>
<p>vitamin D vitamin D is going to help</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>suppress</p>
<p>the bacteria involved in acne it&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>to help regulate the cells</p>
<p>that make up the sebaceous gland that</p>
<p>produces the oil that&rsquo;s all swollen</p>
<p>vitamin E is going to take the</p>
<p>inflammation out of the entire thing and</p>
<p>so it does a lot of different cool</p>
<p>things for acne and so</p>
<p>unfortunately especially when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going through your teens you get this</p>
<p>acne or a lot of people do I did and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s terrible</p>
<p>um boy if I only would have known right</p>
<p>instead of scrubbing my face trying to</p>
<p>clean off thinking it&rsquo;s dirt or</p>
<p>something on the blackheads whatever</p>
<p>um you take a lot more vitamin D and</p>
<p>then you also</p>
<p>fix the other component part which is</p>
<p>the um the high Androgen issue over like</p>
<p>the um the hyper Androgen problem and</p>
<p>that and the way you do that is you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t snack so frequently or don&rsquo;t snack</p>
<p>at all and you cut out the carbs</p>
<p>I mean that&rsquo;s like the perfect program</p>
<p>for anyone</p>
<p>um trying to get rid of acne and it</p>
<p>works and so you start doing</p>
<p>intermittent fasting and watch what</p>
<p>happens to your your face I mean it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to clear right up and you&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to be</p>
<p>quite surprised and very happy</p>
<p>all right let me see uh oh here we go</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s a new one Veronica from YouTube</p>
<p>gotta help her I have both Graves and</p>
<p>Hashimoto&rsquo;s sleep is not good would your</p>
<p>sleep aid supplements uh be okay to take</p>
<p>along with your d3k2</p>
<p>supplement yes yes I think it really</p>
<p>would help you greatly</p>
<p>um because you haven&rsquo;t autoimmune</p>
<p>problem and so you need to sleep and</p>
<p>that would be a very smart thing</p>
<p>all right now uh afreen from YouTube</p>
<p>what are your thoughts about taking</p>
<p>baking soda to keep our bodies alkaline</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t recommend it uh because</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>our bodies need like for example</p>
<p>uh if I were to ask you what is the pH</p>
<p>of the stomach should it be Oakland</p>
<p>if I ask you what would be the pH of</p>
<p>your large intestine should it be</p>
<p>alkaline the answer is no and when you</p>
<p>alkalize these tissues you create other</p>
<p>problems yes it&rsquo;s true that the blood</p>
<p>should be slightly alkaline but the way</p>
<p>you get it there is to eat healthy uh</p>
<p>not to try to change your pH one way or</p>
<p>the other it won&rsquo;t work so um there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>lot of false information that we need to</p>
<p>alkalize the entire body because</p>
<p>if you start alkalizing your stomach now</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going to happen you&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>have pathogens that can survive the</p>
<p>stomach acid and then create sibo and</p>
<p>small intestinal bacterial overgrowth</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll start getting problems with a</p>
<p>lack of absorption of minerals lack of</p>
<p>digestion proteins undigested proteins</p>
<p>so you have a lot of digestive issues</p>
<p>um so I&rsquo;m very much against trying to</p>
<p>alkalize the entire body when you really</p>
<p>should just be eating healthy and let</p>
<p>the body go into whatever pH it needs to</p>
<p>establish</p>
<p>very good okay Bonnie from YouTube</p>
<p>myself and my siblings are all over 55</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re all noticing changes in our</p>
<p>bodies with a lot of aches pains and</p>
<p>stiffness and let me tell you something</p>
<p>ladies I&rsquo;m 68 and what this indicates is</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re well on your way to your great</p>
<p>reward I want to be dreary but uh but</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re having stiffness and they want</p>
<p>to know what they&rsquo;re doing even though</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re slowly decaying</p>
<p>[Laughter]</p>
<p>um yeah well there&rsquo;s a lot of things you</p>
<p>can do of course start with the basics</p>
<p>get get the the basic eating in um I</p>
<p>just did a video on</p>
<p>stiffness for example stiffness could</p>
<p>come from many different things usually</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a low-grade inflammatory thing</p>
<p>going on because you&rsquo;re consuming too</p>
<p>many omega-6 fatty acids and not enough</p>
<p>omega-3</p>
<p>omega-3 like fish oils especially cod</p>
<p>liver oil won&rsquo;t work</p>
<p>unless you at the same time reduce the</p>
<p>omega-6 that&rsquo;s all the the soy the</p>
<p>canola oil the corn oil the vegetable</p>
<p>oil the sesame seed oil the sunflower</p>
<p>oil the safflower oil all those</p>
<p>oils are very inflammatory including</p>
<p>grains so you get rid of that take the</p>
<p>omega-3 and um</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s other I would just watch my</p>
<p>video on stiffness but um you know and</p>
<p>then regular</p>
<p>um if you have old injuries like me</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna have to stab have figure</p>
<p>out some type of workout where you can</p>
<p>start stretching your fascia</p>
<p>um I don&rsquo;t know if I did a video on that</p>
<p>recently but I should but there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>great stretch as you can look up on</p>
<p>YouTube for really working with the</p>
<p>fascia and and kind of getting rid of</p>
<p>some of the scar tissue that&rsquo;s developed</p>
<p>within your this this kind of this this</p>
<p>thing that holds the tissue together and</p>
<p>the muscle together that a lot of times</p>
<p>gets stiffened with age and then you</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t turn your neck and you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>straighten up so you have to actively</p>
<p>work that out on a daily basis okay very</p>
<p>good let&rsquo;s go back to the green room and</p>
<p>this time from Florida we have Lena</p>
<p>coming in from Miami so Lena if you</p>
<p>would unmute yourself you are on with Dr</p>
<p>bird</p>
<p>good morning Dr Berg how are you good</p>
<p>morning</p>
<p>uh my question is related to brain</p>
<p>inflammation and autoimmune diseases so</p>
<p>you did a great video this morning that</p>
<p>pretty much explains you know the foods</p>
<p>that you can eat the supplements that</p>
<p>you should be taking and the nutrients</p>
<p>that are more important whenever you do</p>
<p>have an autoimmune disease but my</p>
<p>question right now is</p>
<p>when the inflammation occurs in the</p>
<p>brain and that it starts to really</p>
<p>affect your psychic so my question will</p>
<p>be how keto and if can really</p>
<p>be you know the way to go to reduce the</p>
<p>inflammation in the brain</p>
<p>right good question is that relate are</p>
<p>you talking about Ms</p>
<p>lupus lupus yeah</p>
<p>well keto</p>
<p>um fortunately gives an alternative</p>
<p>um fuel source to the brain and it fuels</p>
<p>the brain from a whole different</p>
<p>mechanism and so it bypasses the um the</p>
<p>normal thing and uh so if there&rsquo;s damage</p>
<p>in the neurons it will feed it from a</p>
<p>different angle and the Brain actually</p>
<p>um and the nervous system and the myelin</p>
<p>sheath around the nerves</p>
<p>um work better on Ketone fuel so when</p>
<p>you actually donate or you go low carb</p>
<p>um you force the body to run on ketones</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a huge difference between</p>
<p>having a lot of inflammation and having</p>
<p>no inflammation ketones themselves are</p>
<p>anti-inflammatory and then when you fast</p>
<p>you have this additional really cool</p>
<p>thing where you go into autophagy where</p>
<p>now uh even in the brain you start to</p>
<p>have this um cleanup of all the garbage</p>
<p>and junk that occurs within the neurons</p>
<p>so you get this anti-aging effect it</p>
<p>stimulates something called um the brain</p>
<p>derived neurotrophic factor which will</p>
<p>actually help you grow new brain cells</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s so many magical things that</p>
<p>happen but also as a side note</p>
<p>watch my recent video that&rsquo;s not related</p>
<p>to what you said but it is related in an</p>
<p>indirect way relating to um the best</p>
<p>diet for Alzheimer&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s a really</p>
<p>important point that I get into the</p>
<p>detail but</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>yeah because now because what hap what</p>
<p>you have or whatever whoever has this</p>
<p>problem they they had this autoimmune</p>
<p>issue you have antibodies and you have</p>
<p>inflammation so you have to be on</p>
<p>something that</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the most important thing is get</p>
<p>rid of the inflammation anything that</p>
<p>contributes to it and Grains and grain</p>
<p>seed oils are at the top of the list and</p>
<p>so is sugar so um this is why diabetics</p>
<p>have more problems with their immune</p>
<p>system with autoimmune problems with</p>
<p>inflammation</p>
<p>I feel really well and then whenever I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know if people know these maybe</p>
<p>people who do a struggle with locals</p>
<p>will understand it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s a cyclic</p>
<p>thing you feel great and then you have</p>
<p>moments when you don&rsquo;t feel great at all</p>
<p>and I feel like I&rsquo;ve tried every single</p>
<p>um diet out there even when I didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know about the diagnosis</p>
<p>I was constantly advised to just you</p>
<p>know have a lot of fruits and every time</p>
<p>I will eat fruits I will feel horrible</p>
<p>uh or like you need to eat a lot of</p>
<p>quinoa no I will feel horrible</p>
<p>um but you know</p>
<p>what I I guess you know my my</p>
<p>um and I don&rsquo;t want to call it a worry</p>
<p>but I do wonder you know as a woman</p>
<p>um will it be the same you know fasting</p>
<p>in women and men make that&rsquo;s a different</p>
<p>question but if I am having</p>
<p>um one of those episodes where I feel</p>
<p>you know not great</p>
<p>um would that be a good moment to like</p>
<p>increase my fasting with you know</p>
<p>or if that makes sense yeah and I think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s good to prove it to yourself that</p>
<p>that will work</p>
<p>um the great majority I&rsquo;m talking 95 of</p>
<p>people when they start fasting if they</p>
<p>have any problem inflammation autoimmune</p>
<p>it just all of a sudden it gets better</p>
<p>um why is that because you&rsquo;re creating a</p>
<p>um a type of stress that makes your body</p>
<p>get stronger and it affects you at the</p>
<p>genetic level it really helps the um</p>
<p>the anti-inflammatory genes and the</p>
<p>immune genes go into the right direction</p>
<p>you want them to go into so and I think</p>
<p>keeping a log and just identifying uh</p>
<p>when you do bad what you hsb4 is going</p>
<p>to be really important but I will say</p>
<p>you know working with</p>
<p>tens of thousands of people</p>
<p>um it will work</p>
<p>um usually for everyone that has</p>
<p>autoimmune</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s great thank you thank you Elena</p>
<p>so much I think I will give you a money</p>
<p>back guarantee</p>
<p>of course I didn&rsquo;t charge anything so</p>
<p>anyway thank you you&rsquo;re welcome very</p>
<p>good please as always Lena get back with</p>
<p>us and let us know how fasting or</p>
<p>whatever you try helps you it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>fascinating to hear back and thank you</p>
<p>for joining us on today&rsquo;s show Let&rsquo;s uh</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s see go back to did I answer the</p>
<p>question Jerry let&rsquo;s see now we got one</p>
<p>more let&rsquo;s try this one here&rsquo;s a new one</p>
<p>take it away doc okay why do people get</p>
<p>a yeast slash candida infection after</p>
<p>they take antibiotics</p>
<p>All Right audience climb on that and</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s go back to social media</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>huh Micah from YouTube what is the root</p>
<p>cause of alopecia what is the uh within</p>
<p>the hair that immune system is attacking</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going on with alopecia</p>
<p>now I will say there are</p>
<p>some genetic factors that make people</p>
<p>susceptible if their diet isn&rsquo;t right if</p>
<p>their stress is nice and low which good</p>
<p>luck on planet Earth</p>
<p>um so that being said usually these</p>
<p>autoimmune diseases originate in the gut</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re maybe eating something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s creating inflammation and then</p>
<p>you get something that passes through</p>
<p>that that little Junction that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>supposed to be tight and then your</p>
<p>immune system reacts and then you start</p>
<p>developing antibodies to this to these</p>
<p>problems so</p>
<p>um because Auto</p>
<p>alopecia is an autoimmune problem that</p>
<p>being said there are natural things you</p>
<p>can do to offset that and prolong the</p>
<p>problem or improve the problem done a</p>
<p>lot of videos on that you would want to</p>
<p>take um things that</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>reduce this one enzyme called a</p>
<p>5-alpha reductase which is a type of</p>
<p>enzyme that um normally</p>
<p>um is is increasing testosterone into</p>
<p>dhg which is burning out your hair</p>
<p>follicles</p>
<p>um and so there&rsquo;s a lot of natural</p>
<p>things for that one one that I like the</p>
<p>most is something called stinging nettle</p>
<p>root because that does not just that it</p>
<p>gets rid of inflammation it it helps</p>
<p>reduce and balance estrogen there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>lot of really cool things in stinging</p>
<p>nettle root that um that can help you</p>
<p>okay very good Lena talked about lupus</p>
<p>and autoimmune diseases here&rsquo;s Julie</p>
<p>from YouTube can healthy keto help</p>
<p>someone with Ms what a terrible</p>
<p>condition that is</p>
<p>I I think it&rsquo;s going to help them to a</p>
<p>certain degree but they&rsquo;re also going to</p>
<p>need to do</p>
<p>um fasting</p>
<p>prolonged fasting periodic prolonged</p>
<p>fasting and they&rsquo;re also going to need</p>
<p>to do higher levels of vitamin D</p>
<p>now I&rsquo;m going to just say something</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to be getting into DNA a lot</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be creating a lot of videos I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>just organizing that right now it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>fascinating I wish I had this tool in</p>
<p>practice it will allow people to finally</p>
<p>figure out why they have these weird</p>
<p>symptoms that don&rsquo;t seem to go away when</p>
<p>you take the remedy that&rsquo;s one thing it</p>
<p>can do and so um there&rsquo;s a lot of people</p>
<p>that even if they take</p>
<p>you know</p>
<p>5 000 I use the vitamin D</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s still not working for them they</p>
<p>need to take much much higher great</p>
<p>greater levels of the vitamin D because</p>
<p>genetically there&rsquo;s um there&rsquo;s a problem</p>
<p>with the conversion there&rsquo;s a problem</p>
<p>with the absorption and that just</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t go in I mean as I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>you know reading these DNA reports quite</p>
<p>a few people have a problem with vitamin</p>
<p>D and they had no idea so here they are</p>
<p>taking the 5000 I use or even 10 000 I</p>
<p>use and they still don&rsquo;t notice the</p>
<p>difference and so they give up on it</p>
<p>thinking that&rsquo;s not going to work and</p>
<p>now they really go down so it&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>about um finding out what&rsquo;s wrong with</p>
<p>you personally and then addressing that</p>
<p>but but sometimes you have to kind of</p>
<p>look inside the body and see what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on and so the DNA stuff is going</p>
<p>to be the wave of the future</p>
<p>um but the problem for most people is</p>
<p>finding someone that can explain it to</p>
<p>explain it to you so it&rsquo;s not so high</p>
<p>level and confusing and that&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>difficult and that&rsquo;s where I I&rsquo;m gonna</p>
<p>help people I&rsquo;m going to actually create</p>
<p>these videos and I&rsquo;m going to explain it</p>
<p>as if you were a seven-year-old</p>
<p>so that way you can get it oh boy Terry</p>
<p>that&rsquo;ll be</p>
<p>anyway next episode Steve can get it</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s see now uh now let&rsquo;s go on to the</p>
<p>phone in this case uh Jenna from Sweden</p>
<p>or perhaps her dad Waseem Jenna are you</p>
<p>there</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m here</p>
<p>okay she&rsquo;s taking her dad&rsquo;s place uh uh</p>
<p>Jenna you are on with Dr Berg go ahead</p>
<p>with your brief question</p>
<p>or the IPL laser if it&rsquo;s safe does it</p>
<p>cause cancer does it affect fertility</p>
<p>will there be a long-term damage</p>
<p>maybe you can hear Steve but I can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>well I tell you what um uh Jenna I&rsquo;d</p>
<p>like you to get a little closer to the</p>
<p>mic because we could hear you pretty</p>
<p>good at the end of your comment repeat</p>
<p>your question and get a little closer to</p>
<p>the mic please</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>I would like to know your thoughts about</p>
<p>the laser hair removal for the whole</p>
<p>body or IPL laser if it&rsquo;s bad or safe</p>
<p>does it cause cancer does it affect see</p>
<p>if I can&rsquo;t hear anything I can so she</p>
<p>wants to know about all all whole body</p>
<p>laser hair removal treatment wants to</p>
<p>know if it could possibly create cancer</p>
<p>or any other health things is that a</p>
<p>okay thing to do</p>
<p>good question I don&rsquo;t know about these</p>
<p>laser treatments I&rsquo;m not excited about</p>
<p>them especially when you&rsquo;re removing</p>
<p>hair and I&rsquo;m definitely not excited</p>
<p>about some of the creams that remove</p>
<p>hair too that you&rsquo;re putting on your</p>
<p>body unfortunately</p>
<p>you know there&rsquo;s just not a quick</p>
<p>solution other than the</p>
<p>the wax and the tape and ripping out the</p>
<p>hairs and experiencing all that</p>
<p>wonderful pain but</p>
<p>um yeah I don&rsquo;t I don&rsquo;t know about that</p>
<p>and I</p>
<p>my first reaction is I don&rsquo;t I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think I like it</p>
<p>especially if it&rsquo;s a hot laser</p>
<p>interesting okay with my sarcasm good</p>
<p>and uh Jenna I&rsquo;m so sorry that we can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>kind of go on but I was very difficult</p>
<p>to hear you but I think the consensus is</p>
<p>here that uh that might not be the best</p>
<p>thing in the world and if you want to</p>
<p>torture your dad give him a full back</p>
<p>waxing I had one of those wants as a</p>
<p>gift and will never request it again</p>
<p>the came out in me now I know what</p>
<p>to get you for Christmas oh my gosh this</p>
<p>this wonderful cheery Vietnamese girl</p>
<p>was doing it to me and she just I think</p>
<p>started getting this sort of delight</p>
<p>every time I would wrench up in horror I</p>
<p>think it was amusing her I was such a</p>
<p>but anyway I don&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>recommend that for Harry Scotsman</p>
<p>all right let&rsquo;s move on uh and let&rsquo;s go</p>
<p>back to the Green Room a lane is smiling</p>
<p>and that always encourages me if</p>
<p>anyone&rsquo;s uh you know listen go ahead</p>
<p>Elaine with your question for Dr Byrd</p>
<p>thank you very much</p>
<p>um I have a friend that is started using</p>
<p>an EMS exercise suit from a company</p>
<p>called Catalyst and he he said he does</p>
<p>his exercises and he turns up the amount</p>
<p>of electricity that&rsquo;s going into his</p>
<p>muscles and ah that makes me very uneasy</p>
<p>and I was curious what your insights are</p>
<p>if you have any resources I could give</p>
<p>to him that that gives him some of the</p>
<p>warnings of why he might not want to use</p>
<p>that form of exercise equipment now is</p>
<p>it is it electric impulses or is it</p>
<p>electromagnetic uh elect uh Fields it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>electric it&rsquo;s the like giving you little</p>
<p>shocks on your mouth oh the TENS unit</p>
<p>yeah yeah I um</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had those units before and I&rsquo;ve had</p>
<p>even had one that puts 50 000 impulses a</p>
<p>second</p>
<p>um I I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s the best way</p>
<p>to stimulate the muscle I really don&rsquo;t I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know the side effects but I think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s more for a therapy</p>
<p>I know some people use it on their</p>
<p>stomach so that way they don&rsquo;t have to</p>
<p>do a sit-up you know I think just going</p>
<p>back to the old-fashioned you know</p>
<p>workouts might just be the optimum way</p>
<p>to do this because you you want to get a</p>
<p>full contraction relaxation versus just</p>
<p>a stimulus there&rsquo;s all sorts of um</p>
<p>tricks and things that people are doing</p>
<p>to try to</p>
<p>you know work their muscles I don&rsquo;t I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t I&rsquo;m not crazy about that electric</p>
<p>stem for your muscles at all</p>
<p>so I don&rsquo;t know of any long-term side</p>
<p>effects but um if you start twitching</p>
<p>when you take it off then we know</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a problem</p>
<p>thank you you&rsquo;re welcome that&rsquo;s great</p>
<p>thank you so much for your succinct</p>
<p>question Elaine that allows us to get to</p>
<p>everybody and that is in fact everybody</p>
<p>in the green room so thank you all for</p>
<p>being so disciplined and having such</p>
<p>interesting questions that was great</p>
<p>okay quiz question the latest one uh</p>
<p>asked why do people get a yeast candida</p>
<p>infection after antibiotics and guess</p>
<p>what doc a hundred percent of our</p>
<p>respondents say it&rsquo;s because antibiotics</p>
<p>disrupt or kill off the healthy bacteria</p>
<p>and Flora in your gut are they onto</p>
<p>something</p>
<p>they are on to something what you have</p>
<p>to realize that the gut is made up</p>
<p>of not just bacteria it&rsquo;s made up of</p>
<p>friendly yeast and</p>
<p>at least a hundred different types of</p>
<p>friendly Candida</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s in the fungus family so we</p>
<p>have funguses and then we have bacteria</p>
<p>and the the fungus group is called</p>
<p>uh Mike Michael biome and the bacteria</p>
<p>group is called</p>
<p>microbiome so you got these both these</p>
<p>things and they work together and so the</p>
<p>bacteria keeps these microbes in check</p>
<p>they release at least five different</p>
<p>compounds that um regulate the</p>
<p>overgrowth and the misbehavior of these</p>
<p>fungus and so when you wipe those guys</p>
<p>out you just get rid of the police and</p>
<p>then they start going</p>
<p>unfriendly they now they have an</p>
<p>opportunity to turn on you and the</p>
<p>relationship changes to a very</p>
<p>unfriendly candida so um any time that</p>
<p>you take an antibiotic and take it</p>
<p>sparingly you better at the same time</p>
<p>take a probiotic and realize that that</p>
<p>yeast infection can then get out of hand</p>
<p>real fast and then of course then people</p>
<p>take medication for fungal infections or</p>
<p>yeast and then they create bacterial</p>
<p>resistance and other side effects and</p>
<p>problems with the bacterium so you have</p>
<p>a</p>
<p>some interesting things living inside</p>
<p>you that are helping you and you kill</p>
<p>one one thing off another and you create</p>
<p>another problem so you have to take the</p>
<p>big picture and look at the consequences</p>
<p>of</p>
<p>um some of these treatments out there</p>
<p>that are only focused on one thing and</p>
<p>um and this I think this is the problem</p>
<p>in even a medicine they&rsquo;re over</p>
<p>specialized and they&rsquo;re all in their</p>
<p>separate Islands</p>
<p>um focus on this but they&rsquo;re not looking</p>
<p>at the whole picture</p>
<p>okay very good we&rsquo;re gonna go to Stephen</p>
<p>on Facebook for his cancer question but</p>
<p>first let&rsquo;s knock out another question</p>
<p>there you go Dr Berg</p>
<p>okay what is the food with the highest</p>
<p>amount of vitamin K2</p>
<p>and vitamin K2 is a vitamin that is</p>
<p>responsible for making your</p>
<p>bones really solid and strong driving</p>
<p>the calcium in the bones and the teeth</p>
<p>and it does other things as well but um</p>
<p>that would be a big function very good</p>
<p>okay as promised Stephen from Facebook</p>
<p>what are the best foods to eat to fight</p>
<p>cancer or maybe foods not to eat what do</p>
<p>you say Doc</p>
<p>foreign</p>
<p>cancer is a problem with the</p>
<p>mitochondria you have damage in the in</p>
<p>the DNA of the mitochondria and as an</p>
<p>Adaptive</p>
<p>compensation to that</p>
<p>it to survive it shifts its metabolism</p>
<p>to</p>
<p>um no longer</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>running on one fuel system it&rsquo;s now it</p>
<p>can actually ferment</p>
<p>um mainly glucose okay so that&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going on so now what diet should</p>
<p>be on to support that well something</p>
<p>that does not cause damage something</p>
<p>that promotes the health of the</p>
<p>mitochondria</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a lot of foods that will do</p>
<p>that</p>
<p>um a nice balance of um</p>
<p>green raw vegetables with all the</p>
<p>antioxidants but at this at the flip</p>
<p>side if you just eat vegetables or</p>
<p>you know a vegetarian or vegan diet then</p>
<p>you you&rsquo;re setting yourself up for</p>
<p>deficiencies unless you take certain</p>
<p>vitamins and things like that so you do</p>
<p>want a balance of really healthy animal</p>
<p>proteins</p>
<p>um together so basically that&rsquo;s why I</p>
<p>think the healthy version of the</p>
<p>ketogenic diet is the best way to</p>
<p>prevent cancer once you get cancer</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a slightly different program</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done videos on that</p>
<p>um because now you have to</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>depending on how severe it is you might</p>
<p>have to add a lot more fasting and uh</p>
<p>not as much protein but I talk about</p>
<p>that in some recent videos very good</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve got some feedback Dr Berg from the</p>
<p>field Bridget from Facebook says she</p>
<p>increased her vitamin D3 on your</p>
<p>recommendation and my whole body feels</p>
<p>better I sleep better I breathe better</p>
<p>and my aches and pains are much much</p>
<p>more or less I&rsquo;m going to question that</p>
<p>grammar that&rsquo;s all right unbelievable</p>
<p>thank you for sharing your knowledge</p>
<p>with us and sorry for being a grammarian</p>
<p>that was mean of me Bridget I I never</p>
<p>get it right</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s great awesome isn&rsquo;t that terrific</p>
<p>so anyway well give a little bell on</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m glad you feel better uh Dr</p>
<p>nahi Nasheed excuse me from Facebook</p>
<p>what dietary advice would you offer a</p>
<p>patient who&rsquo;s a hemophiliac boy I</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t heard of that condition for a</p>
<p>while</p>
<p>I would I would just um nothing special</p>
<p>I would do the routine healthy version</p>
<p>of the ketogenic diet</p>
<p>um I do know that um</p>
<p>black seed is a is a good remedy for</p>
<p>that condition so that would take that</p>
<p>in addition to the normal ketogenic diet</p>
<p>and with the intermittent fasting and</p>
<p>definitely do periodic prolonged fasting</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s a standard routine thing that</p>
<p>I would do</p>
<p>um and I I just I would love to have</p>
<p>um feedback from a medical doctor that</p>
<p>all they do is kind of start</p>
<p>instead of treating the symptoms as a</p>
<p>primary thing get people on the basic</p>
<p>eating plan and then reevaluate to see</p>
<p>if those symptoms are still there</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going to be quite surprised how</p>
<p>many of those problems go away if you</p>
<p>just work on what people eat and</p>
<p>unfortunately</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s recommended in medicine as far as</p>
<p>what to eat comes from The dietitian</p>
<p>which</p>
<p>you know what it&rsquo;s just highly political</p>
<p>and of course um Whoever has the largest</p>
<p>funding for lobbyist groups gets to be</p>
<p>in that pyramid</p>
<p>okay this is a fundamental question I</p>
<p>think from Justin on Facebook I&rsquo;m having</p>
<p>trouble understanding how natural sugar</p>
<p>will knock me out of ketosis please</p>
<p>share your thoughts</p>
<p>well I think you&rsquo;re probably talking</p>
<p>about natural sugar from fruit right</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what I guess natural sugar or you</p>
<p>should talk about sugar cane well fruit</p>
<p>and sugar cane and beets all have a good</p>
<p>portion of glucose and fructose</p>
<p>so then you also have</p>
<p>dextrose which is glucose made</p>
<p>synthetically so you got the a natural</p>
<p>natural and um</p>
<p>but the actual chemistry of that glucose</p>
<p>and fructose</p>
<p>is the same as the synthetic but you</p>
<p>also have other things in fruit for</p>
<p>example you have the phytonutrients and</p>
<p>vitamins and some Fiber Etc but when</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re talking about sugar of course it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to be way better if you have</p>
<p>natural sugar in its whole form</p>
<p>but if you&rsquo;re just doing</p>
<p>um let&rsquo;s say cane sugar which is natural</p>
<p>right</p>
<p>[Music]</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>versus synthetic sugar you&rsquo;re probably</p>
<p>gonna have the same problems because</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s you lack the antioxidants and</p>
<p>you you&rsquo;re still spiking the blood sugar</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>um when you consume</p>
<p>fructose</p>
<p>um it doesn&rsquo;t actually</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>affect your blood sugars very much but</p>
<p>it goes right to your liver and it</p>
<p>indirectly creates insulin resistance</p>
<p>indirectly so it does affect you</p>
<p>indirectly in a major way I release the</p>
<p>video on that recently but um</p>
<p>yeah um</p>
<p>just because the sugar is natural</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s coconut sugar or whatever</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s still going to spike the blood</p>
<p>sugar and that is the problem with sugar</p>
<p>but whether what other resources comes</p>
<p>from</p>
<p>all right very good we have feedback on</p>
<p>the question here uh the the latest one</p>
<p>asks what food has the highest amount of</p>
<p>K2 in it and forty percent of our</p>
<p>respondents say is cruciferous veggies</p>
<p>20 say sauerkraut or other fermented</p>
<p>foods 20 say leafy greens ten percent</p>
<p>say butter that&rsquo;s interesting and ten</p>
<p>percent say uh NATO or Kiefer natto NATO</p>
<p>or Kiefer</p>
<p>Okay so</p>
<p>maybe some people who mentioned</p>
<p>cruciferous were thinking about the K1</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m talking about K2</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s different</p>
<p>um and some a lot of the not a lot I</p>
<p>would say a certain amount of the</p>
<p>vitamin K2 comes from K1 in your gut so</p>
<p>you can make some K2 from microbes and</p>
<p>believe it or not</p>
<p>um E coli is one of the microbes that</p>
<p>makes K2 so you do have somewhat</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>friendly E coli in our guts but here&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the thing someone mentioned NATO which</p>
<p>is a fermented soybean and that would be</p>
<p>the number one but because the majority</p>
<p>of the population</p>
<p>probably will never eat NATO because of</p>
<p>the way it tastes yeah it&rsquo;s an acquired</p>
<p>taste</p>
<p>um I&rsquo;m gonna I&rsquo;m gonna talk about</p>
<p>the number one food that is most that</p>
<p>most people we eat how about that I have</p>
<p>to clarify that and that would be cheese</p>
<p>cheese raw milk cheese and out of all</p>
<p>the cheeses the hard cheese</p>
<p>has the most except</p>
<p>for one cheese that&rsquo;s a semi-soft cheese</p>
<p>which has even more than that and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the monster cheese and I&rsquo;m not talking</p>
<p>about the American monster cheese I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>talking about the stuff you would get in</p>
<p>France</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s where you get the um the real</p>
<p>stuff and that will give you</p>
<p>um the most K2 so those raw milk cheeses</p>
<p>are going to give you the K2 and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna like you&rsquo;re saying well wait a</p>
<p>second they&rsquo;re so filled with saturated</p>
<p>fat that&rsquo;s going to harm my arteries</p>
<p>uh no it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>I know you&rsquo;ve been taught taught that</p>
<p>but the K2 is going to keep the calcium</p>
<p>out of the arteries and um</p>
<p>anyone who says that 18 saturated fat is</p>
<p>going to create heart problems just ask</p>
<p>them for the reference to study and uh</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s only they&rsquo;re going to actually show</p>
<p>you a study and if you read it it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to be a usually an observational</p>
<p>study and that involves the saturated</p>
<p>fat because they&rsquo;re eating too many fast</p>
<p>foods</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re not going to differentiate</p>
<p>that between all the sugar and the</p>
<p>processed foods with the saturated fat</p>
<p>they lump it all into one thing and then</p>
<p>they call it well saturated fats bad</p>
<p>because we did this study yeah but was</p>
<p>it isolating saturated fat as a variable</p>
<p>no it wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>because there isn&rsquo;t any study like that</p>
<p>good news and if there is please send it</p>
<p>to me I&rsquo;d love to see it all right we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>waiting send it in and by the way we</p>
<p>have demonstrated that our audience is</p>
<p>very smart how would you like to get</p>
<p>smarter audience well you can by</p>
<p>downloading Dr Berg&rsquo;s uh app and you can</p>
<p>see the video find a video so much</p>
<p>easier and the better news is it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>available on iOS</p>
<p>or Android products so folks get that</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll be even screaming faster on</p>
<p>the quiz questions okay let&rsquo;s see we</p>
<p>should also talk briefly about the fact</p>
<p>that you know it&rsquo;s not just the United</p>
<p>States that enjoys your products but</p>
<p>other areas so uh Dr Burr can you tell</p>
<p>them about the progress we&rsquo;re making in</p>
<p>getting your great products into places</p>
<p>around the globe</p>
<p>yeah we&rsquo;re we&rsquo;re expanding of making</p>
<p>things available I think we&rsquo;re almost uh</p>
<p>available in India too so that&rsquo;s good</p>
<p>um so</p>
<p>um if you if there&rsquo;s if you want more</p>
<p>information there should be a link down</p>
<p>below</p>
<p>um in the comment section or in in the</p>
<p>description section okay why don&rsquo;t we</p>
<p>wrap up with social media uh Michael</p>
<p>from YouTube please share your thoughts</p>
<p>about the benefits of krill oil krill</p>
<p>oil</p>
<p>I like Krill I like it it&rsquo;s very very</p>
<p>high in omega-3 fatty acids specifically</p>
<p>DH uh a and um</p>
<p>again I think the majority of the</p>
<p>population is just too inflamed and they</p>
<p>need to beef up no pun intended the</p>
<p>amount of Omega-3 in krill oil is one</p>
<p>way to do it</p>
<p>um you can do it with cod liver oil but</p>
<p>Krill is very concentrated and it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>really good source</p>
<p>on that note</p>
<p>I really appreciate all the wonderful</p>
<p>comments that I read all week long and</p>
<p>even on this show you stayed this long</p>
<p>and I really appreciate that stay tuned</p>
<p>for more</p>
<p>um of my videos this next coming week</p>
<p>and some interesting topics and have a</p>
