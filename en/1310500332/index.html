    <p>The following is a conversation with Jon Donaher,</p>
<p>his third time on this podcast.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s widely considered to be one of the greatest minds</p>
<p>in martial arts history.</p>
<p>And now, a quick few second mention of each sponsor.</p>
<p>Check them out in the description.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the best way to support this podcast.</p>
<p>We got Audible for audiobooks, Calm for meditation,</p>
<p>Indeed for hiring, Masterclass for learning,</p>
<p>and Aidsleeve for napping.</p>
<p>Choose wisely, my friends.</p>
<p>And now, onto the full ad reads.</p>
<p>As always, no ads in the middle.</p>
<p>I try to make this interesting, but if you skip them,</p>
<p>please still check out our sponsors.</p>
<p>I enjoy their stuff.</p>
<p>Maybe you will too.</p>
<p>This episode is brought to you by Audible,</p>
<p>an audiobook service that has given me thousands of hours</p>
<p>of education, enlightenment, inspiration, wisdom.</p>
<p>I can keep going.</p>
<p>All of that through listening to audiobooks.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s becoming increasingly my favorite thing</p>
<p>to do when I&rsquo;m running.</p>
<p>I listen to audiobooks.</p>
<p>And given a lot of things that I&rsquo;m doing in my life</p>
<p>on the technical side, but also on the podcasting,</p>
<p>the people I&rsquo;m interviewing, I actually prefer not to listen</p>
<p>to the audiobooks about the upcoming guests,</p>
<p>or from the upcoming guests, or about the topic</p>
<p>that the upcoming guests are covering,</p>
<p>because what happens is I get so full of ideas</p>
<p>and I wanna stop and write them down.</p>
<p>I want to record audio notes, all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>But, you know, that gets in the way of running.</p>
<p>So I try to listen to nonfiction books</p>
<p>that are bigger picture relevant to my life.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m talking about history.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking about technical topics that are outside</p>
<p>of my particular focus at this particular moment.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when I listen to a few audiobooks</p>
<p>on rocketry, for example.</p>
<p>Anyway, all of that is available in Audible.</p>
<p>I highly recommend it.</p>
<p>New members can try it free for 30 days at audible.com</p>
<p>or text Lex to 500-500.</p>
<p>This show is brought to you by Calm,</p>
<p>a meditation and mental wellness app.</p>
<p>Over 100 million people around the world use Calm</p>
<p>to take care of their minds.</p>
<p>Some folks tell me that Calm is the destination</p>
<p>they arrive at when they listen to my particular voice.</p>
<p>And it is true that the voice of the podcaster,</p>
<p>no matter what it is, honestly,</p>
<p>becomes a kind of comforting blanket</p>
<p>or maybe a comforting path towards calmness.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m definitely a big believer into the intimacy</p>
<p>or whatever you wanna call it of podcasting,</p>
<p>a long form podcast, where it&rsquo;s not like over edited,</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s just the raw human being before you</p>
<p>in conversation or alone.</p>
<p>I love all of it.</p>
<p>Like Dan Carlin, that&rsquo;s alone.</p>
<p>Or Joe Rogan, that&rsquo;s in conversation.</p>
<p>I just draw a lot of contentment and peace</p>
<p>from listening to those conversations.</p>
<p>Anyway, if you want to do that kind of thing</p>
<p>but do it more systematically and rigorously,</p>
<p>you should definitely be doing guided meditation.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a huge fan of that and Calm is a great app for that.</p>
<p>You can get a discount on Calm&rsquo;s premium subscription,</p>
<p>which includes hundreds of hours of programming.</p>
<p>Check it out at calm.com slash flex.</p>
<p>This show is also brought to you by Indeed,</p>
<p>a hiring website.</p>
<p>Even the thought of hiring excites me</p>

<p>So recently I talked to Daniel Negreanu,</p>
<p>and just the quality of his Masterclass,</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s just incredible.</p>
<p>I think for beginners, for intermediate people,</p>

<p>This episode is also brought to you by Eight Sleep</p>
<p>and its new Pod 3 mattress.</p>
<p>Sleep, like diet and exercise,</p>
<p>I think of like a musical instrument in a band.</p>
<p>So sleep is like the guitarist.</p>
<p>Diet maybe is the lead singer.</p>
<p>And the exercise is like the drummer.</p>
<p>And all of those things you have to play with</p>
<p>to create a beautiful hit song.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s one formula</p>
<p>for how much sleep you should get,</p>
<p>when you should get the sleep.</p>
<p>But just like with diet and exercise,</p>
<p>you have to listen to your own body,</p>
<p>you have to understand your own body,</p>
<p>and you have to take that journey,</p>
<p>that scientific end of one study of your own body</p>
<p>very, very seriously.</p>
<p>And to me, you should have the right companion</p>
<p>for that exploration on the diet,</p>
<p>on the exercise, and on the sleep.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m going with Eight Sleep Pod Pro Cover.</p>
<p>It cools the bed, it warms the bed.</p>
<p>Obviously for me, or not obviously,</p>
<p>but for me, I just use the cooling.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a cool bed surface with a warm blanket.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s heaven.</p>

<p>And now, dear friends, here&rsquo;s Jon Donaher.</p>
<p>‚ô™‚ô™</p>
<p>The ADCC is the premier submission grappling tournament</p>
<p>in the world.</p>
<p>We just had it a couple of weeks ago.</p>
<p>We saw many demonstrations of greatness</p>
<p>from athletes you coached.</p>
<p>But a year ago, the team and you were at a very low point.</p>
<p>Take me through that journey.</p>
<p>What was the lowest point?</p>
<p>We had a very, very tight team for many years,</p>
<p>which began in New York City.</p>
<p>During the peak of COVID, training in New York</p>
<p>became very difficult to sustain.</p>
<p>So most of the team despised the city of New York.</p>
<p>I was the only person in the group</p>
<p>that liked living in New York.</p>
<p>I think part of the problem was that</p>
<p>I was the only one who actually lived in Manhattan.</p>
<p>The others had to commute to New York.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a world of difference between</p>
<p>living in New York and commuting to New York.</p>
<p>So most of them had a very negative view of New York City.</p>
<p>That was compounded by COVID,</p>
<p>when even the basic act of training</p>
<p>became very, very difficult.</p>
<p>And so everyone decided they want to leave.</p>
<p>So there was a prospect of a complete breakup</p>
<p>between myself and the team,</p>
<p>or I would have to leave New York.</p>
<p>It was a difficult decision for me to make,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;d lived in New York for 30 years.</p>
<p>I had built my life there</p>
<p>and had most of my friends and associates</p>
<p>that I know here in America were New Yorkers.</p>
<p>So I thought, you know,</p>
<p>these guys have been incredibly loyal to me as students.</p>
<p>So I should also be loyal to them, of course.</p>
<p>So I decided that if they wanted to leave,</p>
<p>I would go with them.</p>
<p>We decided to go to Puerto Rico</p>
<p>because there was a private gym</p>
<p>where we could train through the COVID period.</p>
<p>I personally wanted to go to Texas.</p>
<p>I thought that Texas was a better place for the team to go.</p>
<p>But many of the students, including senior students</p>
<p>like Gordon Ryan, Craig Jones, had been to Puerto Rico</p>
<p>and stayed with one of the head officials of ADCC,</p>
<p>Mo Jassim.</p>
<p>So they loved their experience in Puerto Rico,</p>
<p>and almost everyone wanted to go down there.</p>
<p>So I tried to explain to them</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a world of difference</p>
<p>between going to a place for vacation versus living there,</p>
<p>but that didn&rsquo;t have any effect.</p>
<p>So the decision was made,</p>
<p>a majority decision was made to go to Puerto Rico.</p>
<p>In Puerto Rico, the conditions in which the team lived</p>
<p>changed significantly.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re in New York,</p>
<p>New York is such a big city</p>
<p>that if there&rsquo;s any tension between team members,</p>
<p>and inevitably there will be in a competitive sport</p>
<p>where everyone&rsquo;s fighting each other,</p>
<p>you can kind of bury them in the size of the city</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s so many distractions in New York.</p>
<p>You know, you come in, you do your workout,</p>
<p>you go outside, and it&rsquo;s New York City.</p>
<p>In Puerto Rico, we lived in a very small local town, Dorado,</p>
<p>and most of the athletes were living with each other.</p>
<p>And so unlike New York, where there was always a break,</p>
<p>you trained together, but when training was over,</p>
<p>you went about your life in New York and New Jersey.</p>
<p>With everyone living in very close proximity to each other,</p>
<p>any tensions got magnified</p>
<p>because there was no relief from them.</p>
<p>You didn&rsquo;t get to get away from people.</p>
<p>If you had a problem with someone on the mat,</p>
<p>well, now you had to live with them</p>
<p>for the rest of the day and the night.</p>
<p>And this goes on for long periods of time.</p>
<p>So I believe it had the effect</p>
<p>of magnifying whatever tensions there were.</p>
<p>In particular, there was a family tension</p>
<p>between two brothers, which magnified over time.</p>
<p>And, you know, as so often is the case,</p>
<p>you get two brothers growing up,</p>
<p>one older, one younger, and the younger one</p>
<p>wants to grow and feel somewhat like a young tree</p>
<p>underneath a bigger tree.</p>
<p>And sometimes people just need their space.</p>
<p>So there was some unhappiness.</p>
<p>As a younger brother, I can understand.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>As a little tree that had to grow up under a bigger tree.</p>
<p>Yeah, so-</p>
<p>Fuck the big tree.</p>
<p>My God.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of aggression I have to work on, I&rsquo;m sorry.</p>
<p>Unresolved family issues coming out here, Mike.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true, I&rsquo;m just kidding, I love you.</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t, he&rsquo;s lying.</p>
<p>So as time went by, these tensions started increasing.</p>
<p>They came to a point where it was difficult</p>
<p>for them even to be in the training room together.</p>
<p>At that point, you&rsquo;re starting to, you know,</p>
<p>once training takes a hit,</p>
<p>then you gotta start to address these.</p>
<p>The attempts at reconciliation fell through</p>
<p>and a decision was made to move to Texas.</p>
<p>I wanted everyone to move as a team.</p>
<p>What I wanted to do was keep the team together</p>
<p>as long as the period leading up to ADCC</p>
<p>so that everyone could train together.</p>
<p>So I said, okay, there&rsquo;s problems,</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s just tough it out one year.</p>
<p>We move to Texas, let&rsquo;s just go there and keep unity.</p>
<p>If some people don&rsquo;t wanna train with other people,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s fine, but I believe that the team</p>
<p>would be weakened by breaking apart.</p>
<p>I believe that they had an excellent rapport</p>
<p>as training partners.</p>
<p>Their technical level was increasing dramatically.</p>
<p>Many of the younger athletes are really starting</p>
<p>to come into their own and really develop well.</p>
<p>And so my take on it was, okay,</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s problems, so be it.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s all just stay together</p>
<p>until ADCC 2022 was a unified team.</p>
<p>Go out, prepare yourselves as best you can.</p>
<p>And then after that, we can make a decision</p>
<p>as to whether we break up or not.</p>
<p>But that was rejected and the team split.</p>
<p>And they moved to Austin.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;d made prior arrangements to go to a local gym</p>
<p>and they took that gym and we were left with no gym</p>
<p>and more or less homeless in Austin.</p>
<p>So I-</p>
<p>A year out from ADCC.</p>
<p>Yes, this is one year out.</p>
<p>So roughly three quarters of the competitive athletes</p>
<p>left in one week.</p>
<p>So at that point, that was probably the lowest point</p>
<p>because at that point,</p>
<p>not only did we not have a place to train,</p>
<p>we had very few training partners</p>
<p>for the few that had remained.</p>
<p>And the main athlete in the team, Gordon Ryan,</p>
<p>was going through a particularly bad spell</p>
<p>with his unresolved stomach issues.</p>
<p>And there was doubt as to whether or not</p>
<p>he could compete at all</p>
<p>and was actively thinking about retiring from the sport.</p>
<p>So maybe not compete ever again, potentially.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>So that was a time when it was like,</p>
<p>man, the whole program seems to be dead in the water</p>
<p>at this point.</p>
<p>Most of the competitive athletes were gone.</p>
<p>There were very few training partners</p>
<p>for the few that remained.</p>
<p>And the main athlete around whom the group</p>
<p>had initially bonded was seemingly out of action,</p>
<p>possibly permanently.</p>
<p>Where was your mind?</p>
<p>Where were you mentally?</p>
<p>My thinking is everything bad passes in time.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had a lot of bad points in my life.</p>
<p>So my life experience is whenever things seem dark,</p>
<p>have patience.</p>
<p>Time will ultimately cure most ills.</p>
<p>Not all of them, but most of them.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m confident that if you give me</p>
<p>a new crop of students, I can produce magic.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna take time.</p>
<p>So that confidence was in part a source of strength.</p>
<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s just like, I wasn&rsquo;t confident</p>
<p>that ADCC 2022 would go well</p>
<p>because we only had one year without a gym</p>
<p>and with a team that was completely broken up</p>
<p>to even attempt to get into ADCC.</p>
<p>So things looked a little grim,</p>
<p>but I was confident given enough time,</p>
<p>get in a new group of students and work.</p>
<p>As it turns out, one of the demonstration partners</p>
<p>that I used during filming for instructional videos</p>
<p>who lives in Boston, Giancarlo Badoni,</p>
<p>was interested in the idea of coming down and training,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;d always felt like it would be difficult</p>
<p>because there were people in his weight class</p>
<p>who were already there.</p>
<p>And he felt it would be awkward.</p>
<p>But now that they had left, that opened up an area for him.</p>
<p>So he was the first one to come down.</p>
<p>He moved from Boston to Austin, Texas.</p>
<p>I began teaching at a local school.</p>
<p>It was rather like going back</p>
<p>into my earliest days in jujitsu.</p>
<p>I went from teaching at the big Henzo Gracie Academy</p>
<p>to a tiny school in Puerto Rico</p>
<p>and now an even smaller school in Austin, Texas.</p>
<p>And locals would come in and train</p>
<p>and I would watch every day,</p>
<p>teaching there twice a day, seven days a week.</p>
<p>And I would see people come in and train</p>
<p>and I would say, this guy has some potential</p>
<p>or this guy has some potential.</p>
<p>And I would recruit people and bring them to another gym</p>
<p>where they would train with the professionals.</p>
<p>And if they proved adept and hardworking</p>
<p>and someone who can work well in a team,</p>
<p>they would stay and build their skills.</p>
<p>As time went by, more and more such people started coming in</p>
<p>and we had some remarkable people</p>
<p>like a young South African purple belt,</p>
<p>Luke Griffith came in.</p>
<p>He had lost in the European trials for ADCC</p>
<p>and he was down on his luck.</p>
<p>He came into Austin.</p>
<p>He did a show against a local purple belt and lost again.</p>
<p>So he was feeling bad about his performance and his future.</p>
<p>He came in and I thought he was a lovely kid</p>
<p>who worked hard and trained well.</p>
<p>So he became one of the main training partners.</p>
<p>He was similar size to Gordon.</p>
<p>So I encouraged him to train with Gordon whenever he could.</p>
<p>And more and more people started coming in</p>
<p>to train under that kind of basis.</p>
<p>One day I got a text from Gordon</p>
<p>who was filming an instructional video in Boston.</p>
<p>He said, hey, Nicholas Miragalli was training at this.</p>
<p>He was shooting video at the same time as me</p>
<p>and we just did some grappling.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a really nice guy</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s literally never trained without a gi</p>
<p>For those of you who don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>Nicholas Miragalli is one of the outstanding</p>
<p>gi jiu-jitsu competitors of his generation.</p>
<p>Has an amazing game and is a superstar</p>
<p>with the gi side of the sport,</p>
<p>but had never even trained without a gi once in his life.</p>
<p>So his first ever no-gi training session</p>
<p>is with Gordon Ryan, the best no-gi competitor of all time.</p>
<p>And I remember Gordon texting me saying,</p>
<p>hey, he&rsquo;s really talented.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a nice guy.</p>
<p>And he wants to come down to Texas and train.</p>
<p>So I was like, yeah, sounds great.</p>
<p>So over time, just more and more people started coming in.</p>
<p>And I told everyone like,</p>
<p>you guys are at a severe disadvantage.</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;ve got very little time to get ready for ADCC.</p>
<p>Luke wasn&rsquo;t even in ADCC, he had to win trials.</p>
<p>Same for Dan Manasoyo, he failed at trials</p>
<p>and needed to get a win to even get into ADCC.</p>
<p>So around this time, a doctor suggested by Mo Jassam,</p>
<p>who himself had stomach issues earlier in his life,</p>
<p>began working with Gordon Ryan.</p>
<p>And-</p>
<p>And Mo&rsquo;s the organizer of ADCC.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>For people who don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Yeah, he&rsquo;s the head organizer.</p>
<p>He was able to get Gordon Ryan not cured,</p>
<p>but significantly better than he was before.</p>
<p>And to a level where Gordon could train</p>
<p>up to five to six days a week.</p>
<p>And that was a big improvement on what was going on</p>
<p>during the end of the time in Puerto Rico.</p>
<p>So things started moving.</p>
<p>We had a core group of athletes training at a local gym,</p>
<p>which was very, very generously offered to us</p>
<p>by the head manager of Roka Sunglasses,</p>
<p>a company here in Austin, Texas.</p>
<p>They have a private corporate gym,</p>
<p>which we were able to train in.</p>
<p>And these talented youngsters from around the globe,</p>
<p>essentially, came together and I said,</p>
<p>you guys are gonna have to train harder</p>
<p>than you&rsquo;ve ever trained in your lives,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;ve got less time to get ready for this</p>
<p>than anyone.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re gonna be going up against people,</p>
<p>potentially, who know exactly what I teach,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ve been teaching them</p>
<p>a lot longer than I&rsquo;ve been teaching you,</p>
<p>in addition to the other best people in the world.</p>
<p>So it was an incredible challenge for them.</p>
<p>And I must say, all of them gave</p>
<p>literally everything they had.</p>
<p>Everything I asked for, they gave twice as much.</p>
<p>And we had a crazy training schedule,</p>
<p>as many as three classes per day.</p>
<p>I know that sounds easy, three classes a day,</p>
<p>but try doing it sometime.</p>
<p>These classes are not your average classes.</p>
<p>These are preparation for ADCC.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re both mentally and physically, right?</p>
<p>Very, very hard.</p>
<p>And we had many people come in</p>
<p>and try to train alongside us,</p>
<p>and they fell off by the side of the road within days.</p>
<p>Forget about weeks, months, or a full year of this.</p>
<p>So I gave a very abbreviated set of skills for the athletes.</p>
<p>I chopped everything down to what I believe</p>
<p>were the most essential skills.</p>
<p>Anything that wasn&rsquo;t essential to ADCC preparation</p>
<p>was just pushed aside.</p>
<p>And they had to focus almost entirely on ADCC,</p>
<p>with one exception, I&rsquo;ll come to that soon,</p>
<p>over the period of their training here in Austin.</p>
<p>So it was compacted by time</p>
<p>and also by the breadth of skill that I taught.</p>
<p>Everything was just purely for ADCC preparation.</p>
<p>In a very short period of time,</p>
<p>Dan Manasoyo and Luke Griffith and Oliver Tarza</p>
<p>all won European trials and got into ADCC.</p>
<p>Nicholas Miragalli was already a superstar,</p>
<p>so he was invited, but he had to show himself.</p>
<p>So we enrolled him in local shows here in Austin</p>
<p>where he had his first three no-gi matches.</p>
<p>And with each match, you could see progress being made.</p>
<p>And so that convinced the ADCC people,</p>
<p>okay, he&rsquo;s good enough to compete.</p>
<p>He ended up winning decisively a match</p>
<p>against one of the greatest American grapplers</p>
<p>of all time, Rafael Lovato.</p>
<p>And this was a clear sign that his skill level</p>
<p>in no-gi was sufficient to justify an invite.</p>
<p>And by the way, Lovato had an incredible</p>
<p>set of matches in this ADCC.</p>
<p>Yes, that was actually very impressive.</p>
<p>And retired.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Which is really impressive and heartbreaking as well.</p>
<p>But if you go out, that&rsquo;s a good way to go out.</p>
<p>Indeed.</p>
<p>So there was this long and tough preparation,</p>
<p>and it was compounded by the fact</p>
<p>that as Gordon felt better,</p>
<p>he felt a need to build up his own competitive record</p>
<p>prior to ADCC because he&rsquo;d been inactive for so long</p>
<p>with his stomach issue.</p>
<p>So he proposed one of the most ambitious fight camps</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve ever heard of in grappling,</p>
<p>which was he would take on the current WNO champion,</p>
<p>Pedro Mourinho.</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s number one is WNO, yeah.</p>
<p>And also I believe the current no-gi world champion</p>
<p>IBJJF as a tune-up match, as a warm-up match.</p>
<p>Then he would fight his old nemesis, Felipe Pena,</p>
<p>the only man who submitted Gordon at black belt</p>
<p>and had defeated Gordon in an ADCC match in 2017.</p>
<p>And then ADCC itself.</p>
<p>So there was gonna be three big high-profile matches</p>
<p>back-to-back and very different rule sets.</p>
<p>So WNO was a 15-minute match.</p>
<p>The fight with Felipe Pena was no time limit,</p>
<p>which is a very different format to compete in.</p>
<p>And then ADCC.</p>
<p>So we had to drag out a 14-week camp</p>
<p>covering three matches with three different rule sets,</p>
<p>which went in diametrically opposite directions.</p>
<p>And the entire team had to go through all of this</p>
<p>over this 14-week period.</p>
<p>In addition to the previous year</p>
<p>that they had been working hard,</p>
<p>there was a further complication in the midst of all this.</p>
<p>Nicholas Miragalli had to go to the Gi World Championships</p>
<p>and we had to throw an extra morning class for that</p>
<p>to help him get ready.</p>
<p>Nicholas went on to win the open-weight gold medal</p>
<p>in the Gi competition.</p>
<p>And then the next day he had to come back to Texas</p>
<p>and begin his ADCC preparation.</p>
<p>It was a crazy, crazy time.</p>
<p>But they all came through it so well.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m immensely proud of what they did.</p>
<p>And shockingly, in the space of less than 12 months,</p>
<p>we went from rock bottom</p>
<p>to having a more successful ADCC team performance</p>
<p>than we did the previous ADCC.</p>
<p>It was in fact the most successful team performance</p>
<p>of the event.</p>
<p>And as testimony to how hard those young men worked</p>
<p>in the course of less than a year</p>
<p>to prepare themselves.</p>
<p>If we could just linger on the low point,</p>
<p>is it heartbreaking to you</p>
<p>that the so-called Donahoe Death Squad split</p>
<p>or the team as it was originally called split?</p>
<p>You know, we live a short life on this earth</p>
<p>and you put so much of your love and work into this team</p>
<p>and everybody put in the work.</p>
<p>Does it break your heart?</p>
<p>It was a sad time, yeah.</p>
<p>It was.</p>
<p>It was, you know, I&rsquo;m not a particularly emotional person,</p>
<p>but it was an emotional time for everyone.</p>
<p>It was, it had an element of tragedy</p>
<p>insofar as not only was it a team breakup,</p>
<p>it was also a family breakup, which is much more serious.</p>
<p>I do believe that in time,</p>
<p>even the most intense family breakups can be reconciled.</p>
<p>And I also believe that once dialogue begins,</p>
<p>people will remember just how easy it was</p>
<p>for us to get along</p>
<p>and how tight we were for many, many years.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so easy to let a minute of anger</p>
<p>destroy 10 years of friendship.</p>
<p>So, but there&rsquo;s also the weight of those 10 years.</p>
<p>Like when I ran into the old squad members at ADCC,</p>
<p>we got along like a house on fire.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, we never had a problem.</p>
<p>A house on fire is a good thing.</p>
<p>Yes, yes.</p>
<p>Sorry, that&rsquo;s a New Zealand expression, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, that definitely could have gone the other way, right?</p>
<p>So-</p>
<p>Only a New Zealander would say that it&rsquo;s a good thing, yeah.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s, I still believe, you know,</p>
<p>in time things will be fine,</p>
<p>but there was an element where, you know,</p>
<p>youngsters need to grow.</p>
<p>And sometimes,</p>
<p>think about it this way, from the athlete&rsquo;s perspective,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s definitely a generational problem.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m much older than my students, okay?</p>
<p>And the years and the viewpoint that I have</p>
<p>is a reflection of the time in which I grew up.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re from a completely different generation</p>
<p>with a completely different worldview.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gotta be hard from the athlete&rsquo;s perspective</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re training seven days a week</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re getting very, very good.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re beating everyone that&rsquo;s getting put in front of you.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re losing very, very rarely,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s always a tough competitive match when you do.</p>
<p>Everyone around you is calling you a superstar.</p>
<p>And you look phenomenal.</p>
<p>You check social media,</p>
<p>everyone&rsquo;s saying you&rsquo;re a god on the mat.</p>
<p>And then you come into the gym</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s some old guy telling you you&rsquo;re not good enough.</p>
<p>And every day it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>well, what does this guy want from me?</p>
<p>How hard do I have to work?</p>
<p>Like, you&rsquo;re not good enough.</p>
<p>Like, I want you to be the best in the world.</p>
<p>I want you to be good, I want you to be great.</p>
<p>And all of your friends are telling you all day,</p>
<p>man, you&rsquo;re incredible, you submit me so easily to do this.</p>
<p>And then this old guy&rsquo;s just saying,</p>
<p>nah, you gotta get better, you gotta work more.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not working hard enough.</p>
<p>At some point, you&rsquo;re gonna be like,</p>
<p>you know what, fuck this old guy.</p>
<p>Like, it&rsquo;s tough.</p>
<p>You know, mentally, I get why they left.</p>
<p>When I was 20 years old,</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t get along with authority figures at all.</p>
<p>And to have someone telling you,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve always gotta work that little bit harder,</p>
<p>no, your skillset&rsquo;s not complete,</p>
<p>you still need this, this, and this.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re already doing very, very well,</p>
<p>and far better than all but a tiny, tiny percentage</p>
<p>of people, and then you&rsquo;ve got this guy</p>
<p>just constantly telling you, no, more has to be done.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not there yet.</p>
<p>I can, you know, of course I understand.</p>
<p>Let me just enjoy this more.</p>
<p>Like, it&rsquo;s always a choice in life.</p>
<p>You can be the best you possibly can,</p>
<p>or you can go a route where you just get</p>
<p>to enjoy life a little more, you do other things.</p>
<p>You know, like, there&rsquo;s more to life</p>
<p>than just the inside of a gym,</p>
<p>and learning how to do a better heel hook,</p>
<p>or a better double leg.</p>
<p>So of course, you know, years go by,</p>
<p>you wanna try other things,</p>
<p>and you have to make this choice in life</p>
<p>between extreme excellence versus being incredibly good,</p>
<p>but maybe just enjoying my life a little more.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s so interesting that incredibly good</p>
<p>is a hard thing to deal with.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like when Kayla Harrison won her first gold medal</p>
<p>at the Olympics, you know, to go back to the gym</p>
<p>and to trust, again, maybe the old man,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re being too harsh on yourself,</p>
<p>but to trust the old man.</p>
<p>So Jimmy Pager and Jimmy Pager Sr., in that case,</p>
<p>to say, okay, we&rsquo;re gonna go back to this grind,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s still a path to improvement.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s still a lot to grow, and still have the humility,</p>
<p>even though you&rsquo;ve just demonstrated greatness.</p>
<p>So really good is just a stepping stone to true greatness.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really tough for athletes.</p>
<p>Like winning is actually very difficult.</p>
<p>Gold medals are very difficult.</p>
<p>Plus there&rsquo;s the personal stuff of depression</p>
<p>that comes with that,</p>
<p>which is you give so much of yourself to trying to win that.</p>
<p>And once you do, there&rsquo;s a lot of personal stuff</p>
<p>you have to deal with, which is like,</p>
<p>what do I want from life?</p>
<p>To understand what is exactly, what am I chasing?</p>
<p>Is it just winning, or is it some bigger picture</p>
<p>of excellence that&rsquo;s beyond just winning?</p>
<p>So all of that mixed up together,</p>
<p>and then when you have to be, as a team,</p>
<p>really close together, there&rsquo;s the personal relationships,</p>
<p>all of that gets exacerbated.</p>
<p>Do you think the team ever gets back together?</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s definitely a chance of that.</p>
<p>Right now, I think they have an excellent team themselves,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re doing very well.</p>
<p>They had an excellent performance at ADCC,</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s not a need for them to come to us.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like they lack anything.</p>
<p>They still remember everything I taught them.</p>
<p>They still coach and teach</p>
<p>with the same methodology that I taught them.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t think they have any need to do so.</p>
<p>If they did, it would be because they wanted to.</p>
<p>I still think many of the same personality conflicts</p>
<p>that originated the conflict would reemerge currently</p>
<p>if they started training together.</p>
<p>By the way, to pile on the compliments,</p>
<p>they have really nice merch, too.</p>
<p>The t-shirts are just excellent.</p>
<p>What have you learned from that process</p>
<p>about how to have a team with personal conflicts?</p>
<p>Do you have to deal with these giant egos as well?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Because the ego is in part a superpower, too,</p>
<p>so you don&rsquo;t wanna-</p>
<p>Yeah, you don&rsquo;t wanna suppress egos.</p>
<p>I always laugh when people say,</p>
<p>leave your ego at the door.</p>
<p>What do you think drives competition?</p>
<p>If you wanna be good at anything in life,</p>
<p>you gotta have an ego.</p>
<p>No, I don&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;s good</p>
<p>or even a healthy thing to suppress egos.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a realist, and I understand that this is a sport</p>
<p>where they make one gold medal per weight division.</p>
<p>As guys get better,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna be looking at their training partners</p>
<p>and thinking, I&rsquo;m gonna have to fight this guy one day.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re training next to each other.</p>
<p>Of course, there&rsquo;s gonna be tension.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s always gonna be disagreements</p>
<p>about what&rsquo;s the right way to act</p>
<p>around certain people, certain issues,</p>
<p>and people are gonna come into conflict.</p>
<p>Everyone&rsquo;s being programmed to be an alpha competitor.</p>
<p>You get a room full of people like that,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s gonna be conflict.</p>
<p>Now, your question was, well, is there a way to resolve this?</p>
<p>Yeah, there was.</p>
<p>For eight to nine years, I was very successful with this.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s also a tipping point</p>
<p>where things can flare out of control</p>
<p>and there will be periodic breakups.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not the first students I had that left.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been coaching a lot longer</p>
<p>than I&rsquo;ve been coaching the squad.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m sure in the future,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;ll be other students who leave me.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just the nature of the beast.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sad when it happens, but life goes on.</p>
<p>Like Bukowski said, love is a fog that fades</p>
<p>with the first daylight of reality or something like that.</p>
<p>So even love is temporary.</p>
<p>Let me ask you about leading up the preparation</p>
<p>for the athletes.</p>
<p>I mean, this is such, given the darkness from a year ago</p>
<p>from which you had to find glimmers of light</p>
<p>and try to get greatness out of athletes,</p>
<p>what was the mental preparation like for Gordon,</p>
<p>for Nicholas, for Giancarlo, for the other athletes?</p>
<p>What was the mental side of things like?</p>
<p>Is there some key insights you can give</p>
<p>to their mental preparation?</p>
<p>I really think that people,</p>
<p>when they talk about mental preparation,</p>
<p>need to take a step back and realize</p>
<p>that almost every element of what people describe</p>
<p>as mental preparation has physical underpinnings.</p>
<p>Literally 95% of what I teach the athletes</p>
<p>is physical skills.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s my belief that every mental aspect of competition,</p>
<p>the most important, which will be confidence on stage,</p>
<p>is a direct result of the accumulation of physical skills.</p>
<p>People tend to see things like confidence</p>
<p>as a mental state.</p>
<p>It is, but it comes out of the performance</p>
<p>of physical skills.</p>
<p>All my life, I&rsquo;ve seen sports psychologists</p>
<p>try to create confidence in athletes</p>
<p>through non-physical means.</p>
<p>And it always ends up being the same kind</p>
<p>of cheesy motivational speeches,</p>
<p>highlight video reels where they try</p>
<p>to pump artificial confidence into people.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve never been impressed by this,</p>
<p>nor have I seen it have any kind of positive effect</p>
<p>on athlete performance.</p>
<p>What I do see build confidence is the sense</p>
<p>that athletes are developing skills</p>
<p>and using them successfully under conditions</p>
<p>that closely mirror the event they&rsquo;re preparing for.</p>
<p>Once they get this down,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s where true confidence comes from.</p>
<p>Confidence doesn&rsquo;t come from words.</p>
<p>It comes from accumulated skills,</p>
<p>which experience shows you have been responsible</p>
<p>for successful performances in the past.</p>
<p>And if you accumulate enough of these,</p>
<p>your confidence rises.</p>
<p>So when it comes to the mental aspects of competition,</p>
<p>I created a program where everyone was given a set</p>
<p>of skills that they had to work on,</p>
<p>skills directly related to what I believe</p>
<p>is the most important elements of success</p>
<p>in ADCC competition.</p>
<p>In the gym, they accumulated those skills over time.</p>
<p>I do it in two different ways,</p>
<p>depending on whether these are offensive skills</p>
<p>or defensive skills.</p>
<p>For the accumulation of offensive skills,</p>
<p>I like to have my athletes work with athletes</p>
<p>who are lesser than themselves in ability</p>
<p>so that they start to gain confidence over time,</p>
<p>just as you would never send a beginner</p>
<p>into a weightlifting gym and put 500 pounds on the bar</p>
<p>and tell him to lift it.</p>
<p>Rather, you would start with a wooden bar,</p>
<p>then the metal bar,</p>
<p>and then gradually accumulate weight over time</p>
<p>so you get a progression in weightlifting.</p>
<p>So too in jiu-jitsu, you don&rsquo;t take a brand new move</p>
<p>and say, okay, do it on Gordon Ryan.</p>
<p>Never gonna succeed.</p>
<p>I have the athletes practice their offense on blue belts</p>
<p>and work their way up.</p>
<p>Defense, on the other hand,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got to start them in the deep end of the pool</p>
<p>so that they start to see what are their vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>So I put them with highly competitive athletes</p>
<p>at the start so they can see, okay, there is a problem here.</p>
<p>And then even in defense,</p>
<p>they start off with lower belts</p>
<p>and build up their confidence over time.</p>
<p>So just as a weightlifter builds up his ability</p>
<p>to build weight, sorry, to lift weight over time,</p>
<p>so too a jiu-jitsu player does it</p>
<p>by gradually increasing resistance.</p>
<p>Now in jiu-jitsu, resistance is not done by weight,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s done by skill level.</p>
<p>And so over time,</p>
<p>they started to accumulate this experience.</p>
<p>In time, we were able to switch off</p>
<p>and have them go against very, very tough athletes,</p>
<p>each other.</p>
<p>So Luke Griffith will do a full power match</p>
<p>with Gordon Ryan.</p>
<p>Now, they&rsquo;re fully aware</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s no one better in the world than Gordon Ryan.</p>
<p>So if you have a competitive match with Gordon Ryan,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a very, very healthy sign.</p>
<p>So they went from the start</p>
<p>where they were being programmed</p>
<p>going against relatively mild resistance</p>
<p>and building up over time,</p>
<p>and then building up to the greatest resistance possible</p>
<p>in the sport of jiu-jitsu.</p>
<p>And their goal is not to win, obviously,</p>
<p>but their goal is to provide a competitive match.</p>
<p>Now, Gordon doesn&rsquo;t have any confidence issues.</p>
<p>So for him, it&rsquo;s just good, hard competitive training</p>
<p>against people that are, in some ways,</p>
<p>better than those he&rsquo;ll be facing in competition.</p>
<p>For the other guys, it&rsquo;s getting a clear assessment</p>
<p>of what their current skill level is</p>
<p>by going against the best there is.</p>
<p>Then we add to this a competitive schedule</p>
<p>where the athletes have to go out into competition</p>
<p>so they get used to the idea</p>
<p>of performing in front of strangers on stage,</p>
<p>getting used to the strange elements of going out,</p>
<p>being observed and judged by people you don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>in a performance atmosphere.</p>
<p>And so they were all given matches in WNO competition</p>
<p>leading up to the event, ADCC trials,</p>
<p>local grappling events here in Austin,</p>
<p>and given a competitive schedule to fight</p>
<p>and prepare them for ADCC.</p>
<p>Obviously, as ADCC got closer and closer,</p>
<p>this was pulled back because of the danger of injury.</p>
<p>So within about three weeks out</p>
<p>was the last time we had a competition.</p>
<p>And by this method, confidence starts to grow.</p>
<p>And so the mental preparation</p>
<p>came out of those physical underpins,</p>
<p>the idea of progressive resistance increasing over time</p>
<p>for both offense and defense,</p>
<p>building up to a peak where they go in</p>
<p>against the best athlete in the world</p>
<p>so they can get an accurate assessment of where they stand.</p>
<p>Once you&rsquo;re given a competitive match</p>
<p>to the best guy in the world,</p>
<p>you know damn well that when you go out in ADCC,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re ready to fight anybody.</p>
<p>And defense is broadly defined.</p>
<p>So defense in symmetrical positions,</p>
<p>like positions like guard,</p>
<p>and then defense also includes</p>
<p>escaping from horrible positions.</p>
<p>Yes, we&rsquo;re big believers in the idea of depth of defense.</p>
<p>The idea that you should be able to mount defense</p>
<p>all the way through from early stages</p>
<p>based mostly around anticipation</p>
<p>of identifying danger visually before it emerges,</p>
<p>and all the way through to the deepest levels of defense</p>
<p>where you are 100% defensive in terrible positions,</p>
<p>and you have to claw your way out over time</p>
<p>and get back to a neutral position,</p>
<p>or even better, back to an attacking position.</p>
<p>You have an Instagram post on this topic.</p>
<p>When you get ready to step out</p>
<p>for the biggest moment of your life,</p>
<p>ask yourself one question.</p>
<p>How different is this really from what I do every day?</p>
<p>If the answer&rsquo;s not very different at all,</p>
<p>then step forward with confidence,</p>
<p>and do what you do every day in the same manner,</p>
<p>and ignore the hype and distraction.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re ready for action.</p>
<p>By the way, for people who don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>you need to follow Jon Donahartjohn on Instagram,</p>
<p>because you have nuggets,</p>
<p>or large buckets of nuggets of wisdom often,</p>
<p>which is quite profound, even bigger than jiu-jitsu.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some aspect where you want to mimic</p>
<p>the conditions of your daily training</p>
<p>in intensity and in what for,</p>
<p>so physical to that of the actual matches.</p>
<p>You asked a question about mental training.</p>
<p>For me, the central focus</p>
<p>of whatever small amount of mental training</p>
<p>I give my students comes down</p>
<p>to a very, very simple concept to understand.</p>
<p>This is the idea of identifying competition</p>
<p>in terms of its normalcy.</p>
<p>Most people see training and competition</p>
<p>as two different things.</p>
<p>Training is normal activity that you do every day,</p>
<p>and competition is the exception.</p>
<p>Okay, it&rsquo;s different.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going out, there&rsquo;s people watching you.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a big crowd.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re making lots of noise.</p>
<p>In fact, the promoters of shows</p>
<p>go out of their way to reinforce this.</p>
<p>Look at, for example, ADCC,</p>
<p>when Gordon Ryan went to fight Andre Galvant.</p>
<p>Okay, do they just come out on the mat and fight each other?</p>
<p>Absolutely not.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s music, there&rsquo;s pageantry, there&rsquo;s fireballs.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re literally shooting fireballs.</p>
<p>Yeah, some dude in a tie sitting with Joe Rogan.</p>
<p>I heard about that guy.</p>
<p>Some meathead podcaster, comedian, whatever.</p>
<p>Which one was the meathead?</p>
<p>Well played, John Idaho, well played.</p>
<p>But you see what they&rsquo;re trying to do.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re trying to create theater and pageantry,</p>
<p>when in fact, it&rsquo;s just a grappling match.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just two athletes, a referee and a rule set.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the reality.</p>
<p>Now, what they try to sell you is</p>
<p>something which is not reality,</p>
<p>which is this is somehow bigger and different.</p>
<p>And they reinforce this with pageantry and theater</p>
<p>so that it becomes not just a grappling match,</p>
<p>but a grappling performance,</p>
<p>the same way you have a theater performance.</p>
<p>And my goal as a coach is to dispel that</p>
<p>and say, when you go out there,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s only one reality,</p>
<p>you, him and the referee reinforcing a rule set, that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>Everything else you see, the smoke, the fire,</p>
<p>the music is an illusion.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s put there intentionally</p>
<p>to make you feel a certain kind of way.</p>
<p>And your whole goal is to see this as illusion</p>
<p>and walk out and see only the reality,</p>
<p>which is that this is the same damn thing</p>
<p>you do every day in the gym.</p>
<p>The only difference is you&rsquo;re going with a guy</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve never grappled before.</p>
<p>So the actual act of removing the illusion</p>
<p>or realizing that it is an illusion,</p>
<p>how do you practice that?</p>
<p>So when you step on the match-</p>
<p>Once you&rsquo;re aware of it,</p>
<p>I always have them,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like when you see a magician</p>
<p>and you have his tricks explained to you,</p>
<p>you never see the magic again.</p>
<p>The first time you see a good card trick</p>
<p>from a good magician, it&rsquo;s like, oh my God.</p>
<p>Then when they explain it to you,</p>
<p>I did this, this and that, step one, step two,</p>
<p>then you look at it like, it&rsquo;s not that special.</p>
<p>And when you explain to people</p>
<p>this idea of the pageantry as an illusion,</p>
<p>then just as when you watch the magician</p>
<p>and you learn the trick,</p>
<p>all the magic flies out the window,</p>
<p>so too with the nervous response.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s for the pageantry,</p>
<p>but what about maybe the physical intensity of competition?</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t there an extra-</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s the same in every competition.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like they&rsquo;re twice as strong</p>
<p>in ADCC as they are in the IBJF World Championships.</p>
<p>The physical intensity is always pretty much the same.</p>
<p>They experience it every day in the gym.</p>
<p>Like if you go out and you grapple Gordon Ryan,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not like the next guy you grapple</p>
<p>is gonna be twice as strong as him or twice as fast.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s gonna be a little stronger, a little faster,</p>
<p>but not so much so that it completely changes</p>
<p>your approach of the game.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not that much difference</p>
<p>between the human bodies out there on the stage.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;ve felt intensity before,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not gonna be shocked by ADCC.</p>
<p>But in terms of in training,</p>
<p>do you have to try to match the intensity of competition?</p>
<p>No, that would be foolish.</p>
<p>Every athlete in the gym would be injured.</p>
<p>You can do it for short periods of time,</p>
<p>but the training has to be carefully monitored</p>
<p>in terms of intensity levels.</p>
<p>Remember, we&rsquo;re training seven days a week,</p>
<p>a minimum of twice a day.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve gotta keep things under wraps.</p>
<p>Every other workout, you can have one of the five rounds</p>
<p>can be full power, but not seven days a week,</p>
<p>three times a day.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just gonna break bodies.</p>
<p>And the full power is just a reminder of-</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more about skill development.</p>
<p>For us, it always comes back to skill development.</p>
<p>But what about matching the feeling</p>
<p>of the intensity of competition?</p>
<p>Yeah, periodically.</p>
<p>Periodically, rarely.</p>
<p>But it can&rsquo;t be every single time.</p>
<p>Not really, it&rsquo;s not rare.</p>
<p>Meaning like once a day.</p>
<p>Out of three hours of hard sparring per day,</p>
<p>15 minutes might be like 100% full power.</p>
<p>That way, that&rsquo;s more than enough</p>
<p>to get psychologically ready for the intensity of conflict,</p>
<p>but won&rsquo;t break your body over time.</p>
<p>Intensity of conflict, that&rsquo;s well put.</p>
<p>Competition, doesn&rsquo;t it have that extra level of animosity?</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s a little bit more conflict than it is-</p>
<p>It can.</p>
<p>Sometimes there&rsquo;s personality differences.</p>
<p>For example, like Gordon Ryan and Felipe Pena,</p>
<p>they admire each other a lot.</p>
<p>They respect each other&rsquo;s skills,</p>
<p>but they certainly don&rsquo;t like love each other,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s for sure.</p>
<p>So there can be certain matchup</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s more intensity.</p>
<p>But then there&rsquo;s other matchups</p>
<p>where the two athletes come out</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s no more intense than a hard sparring session.</p>
<p>So first of all,</p>
<p>because I would love to look at a couple of matches with you</p>
<p>and before that, let me say a big thank you</p>
<p>to Flow Grappling for first of all,</p>
<p>helping the sport of grappling and jujitsu in general</p>
<p>by having organized footage</p>
<p>and tournaments that sort of show the sport</p>
<p>in its best light to the world.</p>
<p>And they do an incredible job of that.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re interested in supporting grappling</p>
<p>as a sport, helping it grow,</p>
<p>you should definitely support Flow Grappling.</p>

<p>Also Flow Wrestling.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a huge fan of wrestling.</p>
<p>So maybe there&rsquo;ll be a Flow Judo at some point.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t currently,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think, do any major judo stuff.</p>
<p>So anyway, I&rsquo;m a big supporter of theirs</p>
<p>and I do have criticism that they know about,</p>
<p>which is I hope they continue to improve</p>
<p>on the aspect of making the footage discoverable</p>
<p>and accessible,</p>
<p>making it easy for you to do search through Google</p>
<p>and on their website to find matches,</p>
<p>to get excited.</p>
<p>Like if me and Joe Rogan are getting excited</p>
<p>about a particular match,</p>
<p>we wanna be able to pull it up super quickly.</p>
<p>Wanna be able to pull up Gordon Ryan&rsquo;s matches</p>
<p>super quickly from ADCC,</p>
<p>make it super easy to show and share.</p>
<p>If we have to pay for it, fine, but make it easy.</p>
<p>And when you sign up for Flow,</p>
<p>it should be one click, not five clicks.</p>
<p>It should be one click.</p>
<p>It should be easy.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s inexpensive.</p>
<p>If you care about grappling,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s definitely worth it, you should sign up.</p>
<p>Anyway, my love goes out to Flow Grappling</p>
<p>and also my love goes out to Moe Jassim, as we said.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s the organizer of ADCC.</p>
<p>The next one is in 2024.</p>
<p>It should be 2024.</p>
<p>Well, you should follow ADCC underscore official</p>
<p>on Instagram and just send as much love</p>
<p>towards Moe and ADCC in general.</p>
<p>Like I said, the most prestigious,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like where the best grapplers in the world show up.</p>
<p>And the magic happens.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like some of the most historic matches</p>
<p>in grappling and jiu-jitsu ever happened on that stage.</p>
<p>Anyway, if I could talk about</p>
<p>some of the interesting performances</p>
<p>for the athletes you coach,</p>
<p>you post on Instagram.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with Gordon Ryan.</p>
<p>Gordon Ryan, ADCC 2022.</p>
<p>The greatest event in grappling history is over.</p>
<p>New stars emerged, established stars shone bright again,</p>
<p>but one man stood above all like a colossus, Gordon Ryan.</p>
<p>You have a way with words, John Donner.</p>
<p>I have seen many incredible feats of grappling,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve never saw a performance like this.</p>
<p>For many, Mr. Ryan is a polarizing figure in the sport.</p>
<p>For many others, an inspiration to look up to.</p>
<p>But after this weekend,</p>
<p>there was no disagreement amongst haters and fans</p>
<p>about his merit.</p>
<p>He is the best ever.</p>
<p>It was a long and difficult journey to ADCC 2022,</p>
<p>just one year ago, and so on, as you told the story.</p>
<p>It was a virtuoso performance</p>
<p>of unmatched technique, preparation, and confidence.</p>
<p>No one else can claim credit for this achievement.</p>
<p>This was his and his alone.</p>
<p>No one else today brings together technical depth,</p>
<p>tactical insight, and confidence to use them</p>
<p>on stage as he does.</p>
<p>I had many students, but I only won Gordon Ryan.</p>
<p>And I think Gordon responded,</p>
<p>all this is true besides the credit that sits with you.</p>
<p>Thank you, and a heart emoji.</p>
<p>Very nice.</p>
<p>So anyway, that&rsquo;s as a way of introduction to Gordon Ryan.</p>
<p>Can you take me through his set of performances</p>
<p>and maybe any matches that stand out?</p>
<p>So he competed in his division,</p>
<p>which is the plus 99 kilos,</p>
<p>and in the super fight against Andrzej Gawa.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s correct.</p>
<p>This was, in fact, the first time in history</p>
<p>that this was allowed.</p>
<p>For your listeners who don&rsquo;t follow grappling,</p>
<p>we may have been very rude</p>
<p>and just throwing a lot of stuff at you</p>
<p>without explaining ourselves.</p>
<p>First of all, ADCC is like the Olympics of grappling.</p>
<p>It occurs every two years.</p>
<p>You can either qualify for the event</p>
<p>through winning matches in a qualification process,</p>
<p>or you can be invited.</p>
<p>The only people who get invited are either former winners</p>
<p>or people in the sport who are just</p>
<p>widely recognized superstars</p>
<p>who bring some kind of brand value,</p>
<p>who have proven in the past</p>
<p>that they have what it takes to compete at that level.</p>
<p>In this format, there are two kinds of matches.</p>
<p>There are weight division matches</p>
<p>in which you compete against people</p>
<p>roughly your own size and weight.</p>
<p>There is an open weight where anyone of any size can enter.</p>
<p>So you can have very small people</p>
<p>fighting very large people.</p>
<p>And there is a second category called a super fight</p>
<p>where established champions</p>
<p>who have won previous open weight tournaments</p>
<p>fight each other in one-off battles,</p>
<p>one athlete against another.</p>
<p>So in most of the matches,</p>
<p>you will fight repetitively over time</p>
<p>towards a gold medal.</p>
<p>But in one category, you fight one fight,</p>
<p>the so-called super fight,</p>
<p>which is usually the headline fight of the event.</p>
<p>Traditionally, if you were in the super fight,</p>
<p>you could not compete in the weight categories.</p>
<p>It was seen as too risky</p>
<p>because you might get injured during the weight category,</p>
<p>or you might have to fight four very tough fights in a row</p>
<p>and get exhausted so that you&rsquo;re ineffective</p>
<p>during the main event of the show, the super fight.</p>
<p>So throughout its history,</p>
<p>ADCC has always resisted the idea</p>
<p>of an athlete being allowed to do both weight category</p>
<p>and a super fight.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s never happened before.</p>
<p>Gordon Ryan requested to be able to do this</p>
<p>because of his extraordinary stature in the sport,</p>
<p>the ADCC organization granted his request.</p>
<p>That was the first time ever.</p>
<p>In addition, Gordon Ryan would be fighting</p>
<p>to be the first person to win three gold medals</p>
<p>in three different weight categories.</p>
<p>This has never been done before.</p>
<p>So it was a huge event on Gordon&rsquo;s part.</p>
<p>And bear in mind also that prior to this event,</p>
<p>he had fought just a month and a half earlier</p>
<p>against a former ADCC open weight champion,</p>
<p>Felipe Pena, who had defeated him in the past</p>
<p>in a completely different rule set.</p>
<p>And then previous to that,</p>
<p>against the current world champion.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;d been a buildup to this.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;d been very active coming up to the event.</p>
<p>And then he went in to fight arguably</p>
<p>the greatest ADCC champion of all time, Andre Galvan,</p>
<p>which would occur late on Sunday</p>
<p>and would have to fight the toughest people,</p>
<p>including the possibility of fighting his nemesis,</p>
<p>Felipe Pena, in the weight division</p>
<p>prior to getting to the super fight.</p>
<p>So there was genuine concern here</p>
<p>that he may have completely overstepped himself.</p>
<p>The biggest concern I had as a coach,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m sure the organizers, Mo Jaison,</p>
<p>must&rsquo;ve had the same concern,</p>
<p>is that he would get injured or exhausted</p>
<p>fighting in his weight division.</p>
<p>There were two athletes in particular,</p>
<p>Felipe Pena, who had given Gordon a very tough</p>
<p>40 minute match in a no rules setting</p>
<p>shortly before ADCC,</p>
<p>and his former training partner, Nick Rodriguez,</p>
<p>who were expected to give Gordon very, very tough matches</p>
<p>if they came up against each other.</p>
<p>So there was a genuine concern</p>
<p>that Gordon may burn himself out</p>
<p>before he even got to fight the guy</p>
<p>who most people believe is the greatest ADCC champion</p>
<p>of all time.</p>
<p>So our concern was, how do we manage this?</p>
<p>So what we looked for is extremely efficient methods</p>
<p>of reducing the time of the matches,</p>
<p>making the matches as short as possible.</p>
<p>Our favorite way to fight bigger, stronger athletes,</p>
<p>and I think Gordon was the lightest athlete</p>
<p>in his weight division.</p>
<p>Everyone goes, oh, Gordon&rsquo;s so big and strong.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s actually quite light.</p>
<p>I think he was outweighed by almost all of his opponents.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s nice to see Gordon looking small</p>
<p>relative to his opponents, which is absurd to say,</p>
<p>but it is the open division, plus 99 kilos.</p>
<p>It was plus 99 kilos.</p>
<p>Right, that&rsquo;s what I mean, sorry, by open, plus 99 kilos.</p>
<p>Everyone looks like the Incredible Hulk, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>So our big thing is when we fight bigger, stronger opponents,</p>
<p>we always go in two directions.</p>
<p>You either go for the legs or you go for the back.</p>
<p>And so we constructed strategies</p>
<p>based around those two methods.</p>
<p>So going for submissions.</p>
<p>And we should also mention that ADCC rule set</p>
<p>for regular matches, I think it&rsquo;s five minutes</p>
<p>and five minutes.</p>
<p>Total is 10 minutes.</p>
<p>And then for finals matches, it&rsquo;s 20 minutes.</p>
<p>And half the time is spent with no points.</p>
<p>So these can be very, very long matches.</p>
<p>I mean, to put this in a perspective,</p>
<p>a modern judo match is five minutes.</p>
<p>A modern wrestling match, I believe,</p>
<p>is six minutes in international freestyle.</p>
<p>So these matches can be 40 minutes long.</p>
<p>Now that&rsquo;s a long, long grappling match.</p>
<p>And-</p>
<p>Depending on how you compete in it,</p>
<p>that can have a huge toll on you.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>You can get to the finals and just be absolutely spent.</p>
<p>So our whole thing is, okay,</p>
<p>Gordon&rsquo;s gotta not only get to the finals,</p>
<p>then he&rsquo;s gotta fight the toughest ADCC grappler</p>
<p>of all time after that.</p>
<p>So we were looking for quick and energy efficient matches.</p>
<p>And that meant going to the back or going to the legs.</p>
<p>And in the overwhelming majority of cases,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s exactly what he did.</p>
<p>He was able to get some very, very quick matches,</p>
<p>courtesy of leg lock finishes.</p>
<p>And in the few cases where he didn&rsquo;t finish on legs,</p>
<p>then he would simply take his opponent&rsquo;s back.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a very low stress position to occupy.</p>
<p>In one case, his opponent deliberately kept his back</p>
<p>on the ground to prevent the back take,</p>
<p>and he just chose mounted position instead.</p>
<p>And so he was able to go through his weight division</p>
<p>with extremely low energy expenditure,</p>
<p>which set him up well to go into the finals.</p>
<p>No injuries, very little energy expenditure.</p>
<p>Now, it sounds easy to say that,</p>
<p>you know, okay, the strategy worked.</p>
<p>But in order to get that strategy to work,</p>
<p>you have to have one hell of a set of skills.</p>
<p>And we can see those now.</p>
<p>Would you like to?</p>
<p>Yeah, I would love to go through them.</p>
<p>And I should also mention,</p>
<p>for people just listening to this,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll try to commentate on different things we&rsquo;ll look at,</p>
<p>but the thing that was made clear is,</p>
<p>and maybe you can speak to that,</p>
<p>maybe to you it looks like efficiency,</p>
<p>but to me it looked like Gordon was not even trying.</p>
<p>There was a relaxed aspect to the whole thing.</p>
<p>So maybe it had to do with saving energy,</p>
<p>but he made it look very easy.</p>
<p>And he made the path of submission look very easy.</p>
<p>So here, the first match against an opponent</p>
<p>that, again, looks bigger than him.</p>
<p>Okay, I&rsquo;ll just give an initial comment here.</p>
<p>First, you&rsquo;ll see that Gordon elected</p>
<p>to sit to the bottom position.</p>
<p>The hardest work in submission grappling</p>
<p>is when two athletes take the standing position</p>
<p>and joust for takedowns.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where most of the energy gets burned up.</p>
<p>So working on the idea of energy efficiency,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s go out and we chose to sit into guard position</p>
<p>and then start looking to access our opponent&rsquo;s back.</p>
<p>Because of our opponent&rsquo;s head position,</p>
<p>a far side arm drag makes a lot of sense.</p>
<p>Gordon&rsquo;s able to beat the arm</p>
<p>and quickly get behind his opponent.</p>
<p>Now the question is gonna be</p>
<p>getting into a scoring position.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s too early to score at this point,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re just concerned at this stage</p>
<p>of just energy expenditure</p>
<p>and make the other guy work harder than us.</p>
<p>So Gordon did the arm drag to the back</p>
<p>and now is working on the hooks.</p>
<p>The hooks are not particularly important here.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;ll use it just to get stability on his opponent.</p>
<p>But interestingly, his opponent here</p>
<p>had an interesting strategy too,</p>
<p>which was to occupy bottom turtle position.</p>
<p>And look to get to the critical five point,</p>
<p>sorry, five minute demarcation point</p>
<p>where points begin to get scored.</p>
<p>His idea, I believe, I&rsquo;m speculating here</p>
<p>based on his actions,</p>
<p>was to keep Gordon at bay in a defensive turtle position</p>
<p>until a five minute mark occurred.</p>
<p>In which case he would shake Gordon off,</p>
<p>walk away and force a takedown battle.</p>
<p>How many people are comfortable in that?</p>
<p>And what do you think about the defensive turtle position</p>
<p>versus always trying to come back to guard?</p>
<p>Turtle position is the second bottom position of jiu jitsu.</p>
<p>Many people only associate guard position</p>
<p>with bottom position in jiu jitsu.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s naive.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s two.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s guard position and turtle position.</p>
<p>Now, as a general rule,</p>
<p>guard position offers a much, much greater variety</p>
<p>of attacking options than turtle position does.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not to say turtle position</p>
<p>absolutely can be an effective bottom position.</p>
<p>You can work effectively from there.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s some case to be made that</p>
<p>to wait out five minutes, turtle might be-</p>
<p>I mean, I personally think against Gordon Ryan,</p>
<p>I mean, I admire the fellow&rsquo;s courage.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not easy.</p>
<p>But there was a logic to what he was doing.</p>
<p>People think, oh, he just got his back taken so easily,</p>
<p>but he did have a strategy.</p>
<p>Now, did he pick the right person</p>
<p>to use that strategy against?</p>
<p>Probably not.</p>
<p>So Gordon&rsquo;s able to break the turtle down,</p>
<p>get one hook in.</p>
<p>At which point is this becoming</p>
<p>an extremely controlling position with Gordon on the back?</p>
<p>At which point are you happy with where it is?</p>
<p>At this point, it just started to dawn on me at this point</p>
<p>that this guy actually had a strategy,</p>
<p>which was to maintain a prone position that he&rsquo;s in now</p>
<p>and then shake Gordon off after the five minute mark.</p>
<p>So once that became obvious,</p>
<p>then now I&rsquo;m starting to look at the clock</p>
<p>and how close we are.</p>
<p>If we can take it up to five minutes.</p>
<p>Right now, this guy&rsquo;s only intention is to stop Gordon</p>
<p>from strangling him and finish.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Okay, now the guy&rsquo;s trying to go up in vertical,</p>
<p>freeze it there.</p>
<p>Now, do you see how he&rsquo;s taking his elbows off the mat</p>
<p>in turtle position?</p>
<p>In jiu-jitsu, there&rsquo;s only one reason</p>
<p>you take your elbows off the mat from turtle position,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s to stand up.</p>
<p>So now it&rsquo;s clear at this point</p>
<p>what his actual strategy is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s to get up, force a standing confrontation,</p>
<p>win a takedown battle and beat Gordon by points.</p>
<p>So he did have a strategy.</p>
<p>Now, our counter strategy is always based</p>
<p>around the power half Nelson.</p>
<p>This is a common move in the sport of wrestling</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a great way to break people down</p>
<p>as they try to stand up.</p>
<p>That looks so heavy.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, Gordon is a master of it.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a power half Nelson that Gordon has on him</p>
<p>as the elbows are off the ground</p>
<p>and knees are off the ground.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s going to return his opponent to the mat.</p>
<p>And as you can see, he&rsquo;s successful in doing so.</p>
<p>And now it&rsquo;s clear what the man&rsquo;s strategy is.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m calling to Gordon to break him down to a hip.</p>
<p>You put a man on a hip, he can&rsquo;t stand up.</p>
<p>Gordon successfully does it, traps the shoulder</p>
<p>using that one-on-one grip with his right hand,</p>
<p>puts him down to a shoulder and a hip.</p>
<p>That means standing up is no longer an option</p>
<p>for his opponent.</p>
<p>Now Gordon goes in, he&rsquo;s already scoring</p>
<p>because of the turtle position that he&rsquo;s in.</p>
<p>His opponent stays down on his shoulder.</p>
<p>Now Gordon&rsquo;s responsibility is to start looking</p>
<p>for the stranglehold.</p>
<p>His opponent has basic defensive structures,</p>
<p>discipline with his chin, keeps the chin down.</p>
<p>But Gordon is a master of tying up defensive arms</p>
<p>and penetrating under the chin to get to a strangle.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ll see that shortly.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the trapping of the arm.</p>
<p>Notice that no advanced grips were required.</p>
<p>It was just a spontaneous trap.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the penetration of the neck.</p>
<p>So the arm was trapped with the leg.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So now he&rsquo;s only got one defensive arm</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s just taking that away with his left hand</p>
<p>and he gets a one-handed strangle for the finish.</p>
<p>And it looks like not much energy was expanded</p>
<p>during that process.</p>
<p>Very little.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s, the tournament got off to a very smooth start.</p>
<p>Very little energy expenditure, no injuries,</p>
<p>and a submission win.</p>
<p>Does that, there&rsquo;s a kind of certain look to Gordon</p>
<p>of, that could be interpreted as nervousness.</p>
<p>That was an incorrect interpretation?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a&hellip;</p>
<p>What do you interpret as nervous behavior?</p>
<p>Well, this is, part of me is trolling,</p>
<p>but sometimes on the surface,</p>
<p>confident behavior can look like, almost like anger.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s, Gordon&rsquo;s face had like a vulnerability to it.</p>
<p>Almost like a&hellip;</p>
<p>When you go to judge confidence, don&rsquo;t look at the face.</p>
<p>Look at the extremities of the body.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where the truth comes out.</p>
<p>You see it in body language.</p>
<p>And the further from the face and chest,</p>
<p>the more honest the body becomes.</p>
<p>Look at the feet and the hands.</p>
<p>Well, there were, I mean, he was relaxed.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when you see if people are nervous or not.</p>
<p>He was very relaxed in the extremities, that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>See, you look more confident in this than anything.</p>
<p>What are you thinking about?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s going through your head here?</p>
<p>Is this the same stuff?</p>
<p>Are you intimidated by the two meat heads,</p>
<p>one in a suit and tie?</p>
<p>Or are you not thinking about that at all?</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>For me, it&rsquo;s just about, okay,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the most efficient path to victory</p>
<p>against this particular opponent?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, okay, I&rsquo;ve done my job.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve taken them through an extensive fight camp</p>
<p>that prepared them for every conceivable situation</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re in.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve run an efficient warmup.</p>
<p>Their body temperature is perfect.</p>
<p>The elasticity in the muscles is perfect.</p>
<p>My main role when I corner is I avoid</p>
<p>what most people do when they corner,</p>
<p>which is to be a cheerleader.</p>
<p>Most cornermen, they&rsquo;re not cornermen, they&rsquo;re cheerleaders.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re there to express some kind of emotional support</p>
<p>to their training partners or their student.</p>
<p>Sometimes they&rsquo;re even worse than cheerleaders.</p>
<p>They express their own emotional fears</p>
<p>as the match goes on.</p>
<p>I always believe that 99.5% of the job of the trainer</p>
<p>is done, the coach is done,</p>
<p>when the athlete steps their foot on the mat.</p>
<p>At that point, you shouldn&rsquo;t need me at all.</p>
<p>Everything I needed to tell you</p>
<p>should have been not just told to you,</p>
<p>but imprinted into you.</p>
<p>Remember, there&rsquo;s 15,000 people in that crowd.</p>
<p>For half of the match, you&rsquo;re not gonna hear a word</p>
<p>that I can say.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s too much noise.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;ll hear my voice inside your head</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;ve heard it so many times</p>
<p>over the last 14 weeks.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re sick of hearing it at that point.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re programmed, know what to do.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m usually pretty confident.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also very confident that even in worst-case scenarios,</p>
<p>they can have effective solutions</p>
<p>because they train those worst-case scenarios</p>
<p>every single day in the gym.</p>
<p>And so in part, you&rsquo;re there to have a front row seat</p>
<p>to analyze what happened</p>
<p>so that you can take that to the next match.</p>
<p>The biggest danger an athlete faces is tunnel vision.</p>
<p>Sometimes they will hit upon a certain move or strategy</p>
<p>and just say, I&rsquo;m gonna go with this</p>
<p>when there&rsquo;s much easier alternatives.</p>
<p>But because they&rsquo;re so focused</p>
<p>on the alternative they&rsquo;ve chosen,</p>
<p>they get this tunnel vision and just focus only on that.</p>
<p>The most constructive thing the corner man can do</p>
<p>is alert them to the presence of time,</p>
<p>which is very important in an ADCC match</p>
<p>because all the scoring is structured by time,</p>
<p>and to alleviate problems associated with tunnel vision.</p>
<p>That, okay, you&rsquo;re doing this,</p>
<p>but if you just did this, it&rsquo;d be so much easier.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the main goal.</p>
<p>So here, this was one of several anticipated matches</p>
<p>against, second one against Victor Hugo,</p>
<p>which is a very tough opponent, and-</p>
<p>Again, this was a situation</p>
<p>where Gordon was considerably outweighed by his opponent,</p>
<p>so the main thing here was efficiency.</p>
<p>His opponent elected to avoid the standing position</p>
<p>by jumping into guard, so now-</p>
<p>Close guard, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, Gordon would be in top position this time.</p>
<p>He has a very good close guard.</p>
<p>But unfortunately, Gordon has very good guard passing.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s an excellent guard player, very talented,</p>
<p>but Gordon is renowned as the eminent guard passer</p>
<p>in the world today.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a tall order to hold Gordon off</p>
<p>for a 10-minute match.</p>
<p>Is there something you can say about this guard passing?</p>
<p>Gordon is making it look very easy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s middle distance guard passing.</p>
<p>He eventually passes to mount, I believe, in a very-</p>
<p>Again-</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t you run through the sequence</p>
<p>where he gets mounted?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a couple, I believe he gets mounted twice.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some, back just a little bit further.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s trying one arm under-</p>
<p>Yeah, this is a stacking position.</p>
<p>Now, normally, we always insist on the idea</p>
<p>of getting advantageous angle first,</p>
<p>controlling the feet and getting angle,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a height advantage that Victor Hugo has here.</p>
<p>And the length of his legs means that he can play</p>
<p>very, very wide with his legs.</p>
<p>So getting an advantageous angle might be difficult.</p>
<p>In these circumstances, it often makes sense</p>
<p>to go right up the middle.</p>
<p>Now, Gordon could just go back for legs</p>
<p>because the legs, Victor Hugo&rsquo;s legs</p>
<p>are so far apart at this point</p>
<p>that you could easily isolate a leg and attack that.</p>
<p>But Gordon wanted to show off his passing prowess.</p>
<p>Very often, he&rsquo;ll go into a match and just say,</p>
<p>okay, I&rsquo;m gonna show this skill.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;ll often use it as a demonstration</p>
<p>of techniques he teaches in instructional videos.</p>
<p>So he wanted to show that he could pass the mount readily</p>
<p>on a world champion.</p>
<p>Like this part here, this little step.</p>
<p>Okay, just freeze it right there.</p>
<p>Go back one step.</p>
<p>Okay, you can clearly see that all of his opponent&rsquo;s</p>
<p>defensive frames are built on his opponent&rsquo;s</p>
<p>left-hand side.</p>
<p>So everything is defense on the left.</p>
<p>But you can see this comes at a price</p>
<p>and that price is back exposure on the right-hand side.</p>
<p>You can literally see his opponent&rsquo;s back on that side.</p>
<p>So Gordon&rsquo;s whole game is to place sufficient pressure</p>
<p>that the opponent overcompensates on the side of pressure</p>
<p>just to set up a quick switch across to the other side.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the vulnerability, there&rsquo;s the back exposure.</p>
<p>His opponent has to put his back on the ground,</p>
<p>switch his back.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a world champion right there on bottom</p>
<p>who does a good job of recovering from the first danger.</p>
<p>But unfortunately, Gordon has been here a thousand times</p>
<p>and just switches his hips and kicks out.</p>
<p>A little step.</p>
<p>And so you see there&rsquo;s two changes in direction,</p>
<p>left, right, in a very short period of time</p>
<p>that people find very, very hard to keep up with.</p>
<p>Now his opponent builds up to an elbow.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s looking to create more and more space from here,</p>
<p>but Gordon counters by just stepping over the hips.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just when you feel like every move,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s doing the right things.</p>
<p>The man on bottom is doing well.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s doing the right things.</p>
<p>But the other guy&rsquo;s just been here too many times</p>
<p>and is just a half second ahead of every decision being made.</p>
<p>So that going up on the elbow.</p>
<p>Man, Gordon makes it look so easy here.</p>
<p>It almost seems like Victor&rsquo;s out,</p>
<p>but this turning of the hips</p>
<p>with the arm over the opponent&rsquo;s back</p>
<p>is able to bring him back down and Gordon takes mount.</p>
<p>Notice how Gordon is never satisfied</p>
<p>with the mounted position itself.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s only satisfied with an extended mounted position</p>
<p>where the elbow comes up over the shoulder line.</p>
<p>Yeah, only then does he show,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a little bit of relief right there, right?</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a little bit of relief.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the look of a man who&rsquo;s just proved a point.</p>
<p>This is very Michael Jordan-like, sticks his tongue out.</p>
<p>So yeah, I mean, there&rsquo;s no points at this stage.</p>
<p>He really is going for submission.</p>
<p>And then this happens again.</p>
<p>Is this the match that wasn&rsquo;t, Gordon was not able to-</p>
<p>This was the only match where Gordon</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t finish his opponent by submission.</p>
<p>Was this very frustrating for him?</p>
<p>Was there a-</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually interesting that when he came off the mat,</p>
<p>he was visibly frustrated.</p>
<p>He wanted to get a finish,</p>
<p>but he was not able to get a finish.</p>
<p>He was not able to get a finish.</p>
<p>He was not able to get a finish.</p>
<p>He was not able to get a finish.</p>
<p>He was visibly frustrated.</p>
<p>He wanted to get a finish.</p>
<p>And I think he was more upset</p>
<p>about not finishing Victor Hugo</p>
<p>than he was delighted by winning his two gold medals.</p>
<p>So I think that says a lot</p>
<p>about the perfectionism of Gordon Ryan.</p>
<p>Most people would be thrilled</p>
<p>to beat one of the great grapplers of this generation</p>
<p>decisively in this fashion, but he was not happy.</p>
<p>So this is Gordon&rsquo;s third match against Sousa,</p>
<p>Roosevelt Sousa, another guy who&rsquo;s very big.</p>
<p>Yeah, this is different</p>
<p>because now we&rsquo;re onto the second day.</p>
<p>Your listeners should be aware</p>
<p>that the event occurs over a two-day period.</p>
<p>So the previous two matches occurred on Saturday.</p>
<p>Now we&rsquo;re into Sunday.</p>
<p>Now this puts a different context on things.</p>
<p>If we could just freeze it right there,</p>
<p>maybe go back one step.</p>
<p>Now we&rsquo;re on Sunday morning,</p>
<p>and the idea is that Gordon will be fighting</p>
<p>the biggest fight of his life late that afternoon.</p>
<p>So now we&rsquo;re into the idea of energy conservation, okay?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s okay to have two hard matches on Saturday</p>
<p>because you get to rest on Saturday night,</p>
<p>but now Gordon has to beat two people back-to-back</p>
<p>and save energy for the biggest fight of his life</p>
<p>on Sunday, late Sunday afternoon.</p>
<p>So now the emphasis is on a quick win,</p>
<p>and you can see Gordon Ryan certainly delivers on this.</p>
<p>Now, when you go to entangle your opponent&rsquo;s legs,</p>
<p>the basic choice you have is between straight Ashigarami</p>
<p>and cross Ashigarami.</p>
<p>In the last five years,</p>
<p>cross Ashigarami has proven to be statistically</p>
<p>the more important of the two.</p>
<p>And as a result, many people have forgotten</p>
<p>the value of straight Ashigarami base leg locks</p>
<p>and undervalued them.</p>
<p>Gordon has outstanding heel hooks</p>
<p>from both straight and cross positions.</p>
<p>And his opponent was probably more concerned</p>
<p>about the danger of a cross Ashigarami,</p>
<p>left the right leg undefended for far too long.</p>
<p>And as a result, Gordon goes into a very classical Ashigarami</p>
<p>you would normally expect to see from five or six years ago</p>
<p>and gets a very, very quick finish.</p>
<p>So lifts his opponent.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the Ashigarami,</p>
<p>the entanglement of one of his opponent&rsquo;s legs</p>
<p>with two of his.</p>
<p>Now he&rsquo;s got to turn and expose his opponent&rsquo;s heel.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s an initial off balance to the left</p>
<p>to get a defensive reaction.</p>
<p>The opponent overcompensates, exposes his heel,</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s the submission.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a danger of a leg being broken here.</p>
<p>Gordon has a absolutely ferocious outside heel hook</p>
<p>until you felt it, it&rsquo;s quite different.</p>
<p>So the opponent, probably before he even felt the heel hook,</p>
<p>felt the control and that it&rsquo;s screwed.</p>
<p>That he&rsquo;s screwed there.</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t even want to.</p>
<p>When someone who knows what they&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>gets a bite on your leg like that,</p>
<p>you feel it deep inside your knee</p>
<p>and ankle tendons immediately.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a sense in which you almost tap.</p>
<p>He got a couple of taps, almost like as if they&rsquo;re early,</p>
<p>because the opponent knows.</p>
<p>People came up to us and said,</p>
<p>this guy tapped early.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, hmm.</p>
<p>No, he knew.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>He knew that late would be a big problem.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>So this is within like 30 seconds, within 10 seconds.</p>
<p>I think it was within 10 seconds.</p>
<p>So this was an excellent example of someone saying,</p>
<p>okay, I&rsquo;m gonna conserve energy with a short match.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not just gonna go down into a neutral position.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna directly pull into a leg lock attack</p>
<p>from standing position.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t see that much in heavyweight divisions.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s something you see more in the lightweight divisions.</p>
<p>So we gotta go to the final match of Gordon&rsquo;s</p>
<p>within his division, which I think,</p>
<p>as opposed to facing Felipe Pena,</p>
<p>who lost to Nicky Rod.</p>
<p>Nicky Rod had a great match against Felipe Pena</p>
<p>and passed Felipe Pena&rsquo;s guard.</p>
<p>I think only the second person in ADCC competition</p>
<p>to accomplish that.</p>
<p>I believe with a body lock.</p>
<p>It started as a body lock,</p>
<p>but he converted to half guard, top head and arm</p>
<p>and passed out of half guard top, chest to chest.</p>
<p>I think I listened to a Craig Jones sort of interview</p>
<p>summarizing what happened to ADCC.</p>
<p>And he briefly mentioned that Nicky Rod might have</p>
<p>the best body lock pass that he&rsquo;s ever felt.</p>
<p>So like-</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s very, very good with the body lock.</p>
<p>The way to face Nicky Rod is don&rsquo;t get him,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t let him get the body lock.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a problem if you stand up,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a good wrestler.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a dilemma there.</p>
<p>Like you have to sit down to guard,</p>
<p>but that goes into his body lock.</p>
<p>But then if you stand up,</p>
<p>now you go into his wrestling skill.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a great dilemma that he has.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what,</p>
<p>in facing Nicky Rod,</p>
<p>Gordon Ryan here chooses to,</p>
<p>yeah, if you look at the limbs,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a relaxation there.</p>
<p>We should also explain some things here.</p>
<p>This is a finals match.</p>
<p>So instead of being 10 minutes long,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s 20 minutes long with the option of a 20 minute overtime.</p>
<p>So this could potentially be a 40 minute match.</p>
<p>So you can see why the ADCC people were very concerned</p>
<p>about Gordon doing this match,</p>
<p>because what if this match had gone 40 minutes</p>
<p>and then an exhausted Gordon Ryan</p>
<p>has to go out to fight Andre Galvan,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s fresh and ready to maul him.</p>
<p>And on top of that is two former teammates.</p>
<p>Who know each other&rsquo;s game very well.</p>
<p>So there was a high likelihood in most people&rsquo;s minds</p>
<p>that this would go the distance.</p>
<p>Because when you train with each other for years,</p>
<p>every single day in the gym, seven days a week,</p>
<p>you get to know each other&rsquo;s tricks.</p>
<p>One big problem here for Nicky Rod is that</p>
<p>his body lock guard passing game,</p>
<p>which is his main weapon on the ground,</p>
<p>was taught to him by us.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not like we&rsquo;re gonna be taken by surprise by it.</p>
<p>So that must have been figuring in his mind.</p>
<p>Do you think psychologically for Gordon</p>
<p>and psychologically for Nicky Rod, it&rsquo;s tough?</p>
<p>So for him with that body lock, for example,</p>
<p>do you think it&rsquo;s tough for him to know what to do here?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s tough because he would have remembered</p>
<p>the outcome of the training sessions.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to go up against the guy</p>
<p>who used to dominate you in training</p>
<p>and then say, okay, I&rsquo;m gonna beat him in competition.</p>
<p>But can you shut all of that off?</p>
<p>Because-</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s tough, man.</p>
<p>Memory is memory.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t lie to yourself.</p>
<p>Well, what do you think about competition?</p>
<p>Sort of there&rsquo;s been a lot of, Olympics bring this out.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s been a lot of big upsets at the Olympics.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something where people find something in them.</p>
<p>I mean, judo is a different sport than grappling.</p>
<p>In judo, there&rsquo;s much more room for upset</p>
<p>because a mistake in judo</p>
<p>will have ramifications that will be felt</p>
<p>within half a second.</p>
<p>Like if you take the wrong grip in judo,</p>
<p>you can be thrown in half a second and there&rsquo;s no recovery.</p>
<p>If your two shoulders hit the mat with momentum,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s over, it&rsquo;s done.</p>
<p>In jujitsu, you could, especially in ADCC</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s no points in the first five minutes,</p>
<p>you could get taken down and mounted by your opponent</p>
<p>and still win.</p>
<p>Like you can recover from a bad start.</p>
<p>In judo, boxing, kickboxing, MMA, you get hit,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no recovery time.</p>
<p>You just get swarmed on.</p>
<p>And jujitsu is a much more forgiving sport</p>
<p>where you can make a series of blunders</p>
<p>and you just recover from them.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t make a series of blunders in boxing,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re unconscious.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s the blunder case,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s also been just people where it&rsquo;s their day.</p>
<p>I mean, again, maybe it&rsquo;s romanticizing the notion,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s been some epic performances</p>
<p>in Olympic wrestling, in Olympic judo.</p>
<p>As an example, Satoshi Ishii, he had a 2008 performance.</p>
<p>We talked about the All Japan and all that kind of stuff,</p>
<p>but the Olympics, he destroyed everybody on this path</p>
<p>to the Olympic gold medal.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s when Teddy Rennero was also competing,</p>
<p>he got the bronze.</p>
<p>So, I mean that, and you could say he was at that time</p>
<p>the best in the world also,</p>
<p>but some people have a say.</p>
<p>Yeah, but I think it would be very fair to say</p>
<p>he was the best in the world.</p>
<p>I think about the people he beat</p>
<p>to win three All Japan championships.</p>
<p>Like he beat Kosei Inoue, he beat Keiji Suzuki,</p>
<p>they were Olympic champions.</p>
<p>Like he was already-</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t believe in free will?</p>
<p>No, I don&rsquo;t believe that a person</p>
<p>can walk on stage and be better</p>
<p>than what they are supposed to be.</p>
<p>You have a skill level, it&rsquo;s set in stone.</p>
<p>This is your skill level.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t just go on stage</p>
<p>and suddenly your skill level gets here.</p>
<p>What you do have is a situation</p>
<p>where you have a skill level, okay?</p>
<p>Another opponent has a higher skill level,</p>
<p>but he runs into confidence issues</p>
<p>so that he only uses a small percentage</p>
<p>of his actual skills.</p>
<p>And then he will fall below someone</p>
<p>who is technically lower on the skill scale than he is.</p>
<p>That can happen,</p>
<p>but you can&rsquo;t just magically acquire skills-</p>
<p>Yeah, but all of us are able to fall in confidence.</p>
<p>Yes, so the question becomes who manages that fall best?</p>
<p>And that can create upsets, absolutely.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t think Gordon could have fallen in confidence</p>
<p>against a former teammate when the pressure is so high?</p>
<p>There was just no basis for a fall to occur.</p>
<p>You said he doesn&rsquo;t have confidence issues.</p>
<p>What do you attribute that to?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s because he never loses in the gym.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no experience that he&rsquo;s had</p>
<p>that would make him say,</p>
<p>I shouldn&rsquo;t be this confident.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s the physical,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like we talked about mental preparation-</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong,</p>
<p>if Gordon lost 20 matches in a row,</p>
<p>of course his confidence would drop</p>
<p>because experience is now,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s gonna be a psychological dissonance</p>
<p>between his experience, his recent experience,</p>
<p>and what he believes.</p>
<p>Okay, if you believe you&rsquo;re the best in the world,</p>
<p>you just lost 20 matches,</p>
<p>at some point reality&rsquo;s gonna break in.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re just never losing in competition,</p>
<p>dominating people in the gym,</p>
<p>then there&rsquo;s nothing in your experience</p>
<p>that would shake your confidence.</p>
<p>Can I ask you this just in a small tangent?</p>
<p>Why is Gordon Ryan so good?</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re looking at,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve trained a lot of special athletes,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re a special human being yourself.</p>
<p>I could just look at human history.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of,</p>
<p>not a lot,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some special humans.</p>
<p>It seems like Gordon Ryan is one of them.</p>
<p>I totally agree with that.</p>
<p>Can you try to dissect-</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I meant when I said</p>
<p>I had many students,</p>
<p>but only one Gordon Ryan.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve taught many, many people,</p>
<p>but they don&rsquo;t all have his skill level.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s an obvious elephant in the room here.</p>
<p>What distinguishes him from other athletes?</p>
<p>Great question.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll try and give an answer.</p>
<p>More than anyone else that I&rsquo;ve ever taught,</p>
<p>he has a memory for things that were taught to him.</p>
<p>He has an ability to recall information</p>
<p>that is extraordinary compared</p>
<p>with other people in the room.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s definitely a big part of it.</p>
<p>Secondly, he has a pride in technique</p>
<p>and technical prowess</p>
<p>that will not allow him to settle</p>
<p>for anything less than perfection.</p>
<p>And he will hate himself when there is imperfection.</p>
<p>So there is a love of excellence</p>
<p>and a hatred of anything less than excellence.</p>
<p>He has an ability</p>
<p>to pull the trigger when opportunity arises,</p>
<p>which is truly extraordinary.</p>
<p>Many people know what to do,</p>
<p>but when the moment comes, they back off</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll doubt themselves.</p>
<p>If Gordon sees the opportunity,</p>
<p>the trigger pulls every time.</p>
<p>So can I just linger on that briefly?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a few times where he gets</p>
<p>a little bit of an advantage</p>
<p>and he just chases it to get a big,</p>
<p>like with Andre Galvao,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like there&rsquo;s a dance and you get one step ahead</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s able to chase that.</p>
<p>Get a little glimmer of the back</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s able to chase that all the way to back control.</p>
<p>So is that kind of the trigger that you&rsquo;re referring to?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>It runs deeper than that too.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the idea that good athletes are greedy athletes.</p>
<p>Okay, when they see a small opportunity,</p>
<p>they try and get as big a bite of it as possible.</p>
<p>So that a mantra that we always have in training,</p>
<p>if you can see the back, you can take the back.</p>
<p>And if Gordon sees an inch of your back,</p>
<p>you know that&rsquo;s the direction he&rsquo;s gonna be going.</p>
<p>If your far shoulder is within an inch of the floor,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s gonna be mounting you.</p>
<p>If your shoulder comes off the floor,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;d be on your back on the other side.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a maximalist with opportunity.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not satisfied with,</p>
<p>oh, let me get a good enough outcome.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, I want the maximal outcome.</p>
<p>So when you combine all these things together,</p>
<p>an ability to recall information,</p>
<p>which is just far superior to anyone else I&rsquo;ve ever coached.</p>
<p>An ability to work in the training room</p>
<p>towards not just good technique, but excellent technique.</p>
<p>The confidence to pull the trigger</p>
<p>whenever the opportunity arises.</p>
<p>A maximalist mindset where it&rsquo;s never enough</p>
<p>to have a good enough outcome.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always gotta be the best possible outcome.</p>
<p>And the fifth element,</p>
<p>which I believe is very, very important,</p>
<p>is extraordinary depth in his technical prowess.</p>
<p>In his technical prowess.</p>
<p>In particular, with regards his defensive acumen.</p>
<p>Everyone looks at Gordon and focuses</p>
<p>on his offensive prowess</p>
<p>because they see him dominate other athletes.</p>
<p>But what they don&rsquo;t see is what I see every day in the gym</p>
<p>where he works from impossibly bad defensive position.</p>
<p>Someone locked in on a full heel hook on his body,</p>
<p>and a full judogitami amba in a complete pin</p>
<p>mounted with Gordon&rsquo;s two arms stretched out over his head</p>
<p>in what looks like a hopeless position.</p>
<p>And Gordon will work in these positions.</p>
<p>And of course, because it&rsquo;s such a bad position,</p>
<p>sometimes he&rsquo;ll have to tap.</p>
<p>But he just works so relentlessly in these bad positions</p>
<p>that when he steps on stage, he&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>if this guy got the worst possible position on me,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s nothing he could do with it.</p>
<p>And within 30 seconds, I could turn it around on him</p>
<p>and win this match.</p>
<p>That gives his game an overall breadth and depth,</p>
<p>which is very, very hard to deal with.</p>
<p>It means there&rsquo;s no obvious weak point</p>
<p>where you can just say, okay, I&rsquo;m gonna attack him here</p>
<p>and use this strategy to beat him.</p>
<p>And that goes back to his confidence.</p>
<p>The reason why most people lack confidence</p>
<p>is because they fear bad outcomes, okay?</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a strong guard player,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got an excellent guard,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re terrified of leg locks,</p>
<p>and your opponent has strong leg locks,</p>
<p>you will shut down your own guard</p>
<p>and won&rsquo;t play as freely and well as you normally do</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re afraid of the leg lock danger.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll pull your feet in,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll play a very conservative guard game.</p>
<p>But if you had extremely adept leg lock defense,</p>
<p>then you just play with all the confidence</p>
<p>you normally do from guard position.</p>
<p>Gordon puts himself in that situation.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s so defensively sound</p>
<p>that it translates into his offensive confidence.</p>
<p>When you talk about memory recall,</p>
<p>which is interesting,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t help but see parallels</p>
<p>between him and Magnus Carlsen, who&rsquo;s a chess player,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s the number one in the world,</p>
<p>arguably the best ever, certainly the best ever,</p>
<p>if you just look at absolute numbers.</p>
<p>The chess has the luxury of having a rating,</p>
<p>which you cannot have in jiu-jitsu</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a game of human chess.</p>
<p>Chess is just a board game,</p>
<p>so you can actually calculate</p>
<p>the probability that you could win.</p>
<p>So he has the highest ELO rating ever,</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s maintained that rating.</p>
<p>Without competing against the number two in the world,</p>
<p>he could just prove that he&rsquo;s the number one</p>
<p>in the world for many years.</p>
<p>Anyway, there&rsquo;s certain similarities.</p>
<p>One is ability to recall.</p>
<p>So memory recall of information is fascinatingly good.</p>
<p>And the other one is not so much a love for perfection,</p>
<p>which is something you mentioned,</p>
<p>but the flip side of that,</p>
<p>which is what you also mentioned</p>
<p>is the hate of imperfection.</p>
<p>Now, in the case of Magnus,</p>
<p>it almost creates a level of anxiety for him</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s almost destructive.</p>
<p>So the thing he seems to hate the most</p>
<p>is imperfection against people he knows are worse than him.</p>
<p>So the thing he loves is competing against people</p>
<p>that are close to his skill level</p>
<p>or the favorite is people who are,</p>
<p>might actually be better than him,</p>
<p>especially in certain positions.</p>
<p>He loves competing against them.</p>
<p>He hates competing against people that are still,</p>
<p>from the perspective of everyone else,</p>
<p>what are called super grandmasters,</p>
<p>so top three in the world,</p>
<p>but he knows he&rsquo;s much better than them.</p>
<p>And the anxiety of being not perfect against those people,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why he, I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;re paying attention,</p>
<p>but he stepped away.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not gonna defend his world championship</p>
<p>because he hates the anxiety</p>
<p>of playing people worse than him.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>He figures they would somehow make him look bad or?</p>
<p>No, he just, for him,</p>
<p>at least the language he uses, it&rsquo;s just not fun.</p>
<p>And he likes having fun.</p>
<p>To him, it was fun to win, no matter the skill level,</p>
<p>the world championship the first time,</p>
<p>but then defending it is a very grueling process.</p>
<p>With classical chess, you play these many hour,</p>
<p>it could be seven hour long games.</p>
<p>And on top of that, he really hates the fact</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s only, I forget what it is,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s single digit number of games.</p>
<p>He says it&rsquo;s low sample.</p>
<p>So I can&rsquo;t, I would like to play 20, 30, 40, 50 games</p>
<p>if we&rsquo;re gonna do it this way.</p>
<p>But then they&rsquo;re too long, it&rsquo;s gonna take too long.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s really emphasizes the fun of it</p>
<p>and the clear demonstration of who&rsquo;s the best.</p>
<p>Now, chess is an interesting game.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably different than grappling</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s been played for centuries.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s this giant body of people that are playing it.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s other Gordon Ryans out there.</p>
<p>Imagine a world where there&rsquo;s multiple Gordon Ryans</p>
<p>or something like that, different dimensions,</p>
<p>but you have like sharks everywhere.</p>
<p>And so there is fun to be had</p>
<p>even at the very, very, very, very top.</p>
<p>But the memory recall is the thing that stands out</p>
<p>and the hate of imperfection,</p>
<p>more intense than anybody else in the game.</p>
<p>Fascinating.</p>
<p>That takes us back to the final.</p>
<p>Ah, yes.</p>
<p>So here Gordon is facing Nicky Rod,</p>
<p>former training partner.</p>
<p>And again, the intention here is</p>
<p>this has to be put in the context</p>
<p>that Gordon will be fighting</p>
<p>the greatest ACC grappler of all time</p>
<p>in a few hours after this.</p>
<p>So what we&rsquo;re looking for is a quick resolution,</p>
<p>still the shortest possible match.</p>
<p>Now, there&rsquo;s a complicating factor here.</p>
<p>Nicky Rod was a wrestler before he was a jiu-jitsu player.</p>
<p>On paper, the way his route to win is via wrestling.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not gonna be able to submit Gordon Ryan</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s not gonna be able to pass his guard.</p>
<p>So he has to win by wrestling.</p>
<p>In the ADCC finals, you cannot sit to guard.</p>
<p>So the approach that Gordon used earlier</p>
<p>that we saw on video cannot be used in the finals.</p>
<p>Gordon must wrestle his opponent.</p>
<p>So on the way out,</p>
<p>Gordon and I were talking</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;d had discussions obviously during the cam,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the appropriate thing to do here.</p>
<p>And there had been some</p>
<p>matches earlier in the event</p>
<p>where it was becoming obvious</p>
<p>that stalling was being heavily punished by referees.</p>
<p>So I said to Gordon on the way out,</p>
<p>just give him your leg.</p>
<p>Let him take you down.</p>
<p>Because in the first 10 minutes of the finals,</p>
<p>takedowns don&rsquo;t score anything</p>
<p>or there are no means of scoring the first 10 minutes,</p>
<p>but you can&rsquo;t sit to guard.</p>
<p>That will award you a negative point.</p>
<p>So I said, just let Nicky Rod take you down.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, Nicky Rod&rsquo;s not gonna take the bait.</p>
<p>And I said, if he doesn&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;ll call him for stalling.</p>
<p>And so.</p>
<p>And then Craig Jones also commented after the fact,</p>
<p>is I don&rsquo;t know why Nicky Rod took the bait.</p>
<p>So if we see the start of the match,</p>
<p>you see Gordon comes out and offers a leg.</p>
<p>Now, it&rsquo;s not that, you know, Nicky Rod is smart.</p>
<p>He knows what&rsquo;s happening here.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s he gonna do?</p>
<p>Stall for 10 minutes</p>
<p>and get like five stalling calls put against him?</p>
<p>So Gordon gives him the takedown.</p>
<p>That way they go to the ground immediately with no effort.</p>
<p>And the match now favors Gordon</p>
<p>because Gordon is significantly more skilled on the ground.</p>
<p>The question is,</p>
<p>how can we make this match as short as possible?</p>
<p>And as is so often the case, the answer comes back to legs.</p>
<p>So for people just listening to this,</p>
<p>Gordon is in an open guard</p>
<p>and Nicky Rod appears to be trying to keep his hips away</p>
<p>from Gordon&rsquo;s legs.</p>
<p>Yes, the big, Nicky Rod knows there&rsquo;s a danger here.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s elected to go to his knees</p>
<p>that will set up his favorite body lock passes.</p>
<p>And it will, in some ways,</p>
<p>mitigate some of the dangers associated with leg locks.</p>
<p>So Gordon&rsquo;s whole thing is,</p>
<p>how am I gonna get my body weight underneath him?</p>
<p>He has a choice between linear entries</p>
<p>where he enters between his opponent&rsquo;s knees</p>
<p>and circular entries where he inverts</p>
<p>and spins underneath his opponent</p>
<p>to get under a center of gravity.</p>
<p>Is there a way for somebody to try to get a body lock</p>
<p>without giving Gordon an opportunity to get under them?</p>
<p>Well, the body lock is an excellent way</p>
<p>to shut down leg lock entries</p>
<p>if you can get to the body lock.</p>
<p>But you can see Gordon&rsquo;s very, very disciplined</p>
<p>with his elbow and knee position.</p>
<p>Elbows and knees work in a position</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s very, very hard</p>
<p>for his opponent to access his waist.</p>
<p>That shoulder&rsquo;s always either across the hip</p>
<p>or in front of the shoulder.</p>
<p>Sorry, his knee is either in front of the shoulder</p>
<p>or in front of the hip.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re one minute into the match,</p>
<p>and just if I were to look at the video player here,</p>
<p>it appears that the match is over soon.</p>
<p>So I guess Nicky Riot is facing this.</p>
<p>I need to get close in order to do the body lock.</p>
<p>And the closer you get, the more danger there is</p>
<p>to let Gordon get under you and get the leg control.</p>
<p>Now they&rsquo;re starting to get close here.</p>
<p>Gordon&rsquo;s going to try and get his head</p>
<p>underneath his opponent</p>
<p>and make a circular entry into the legs.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s clearing his opponent&rsquo;s head out of the way</p>
<p>by faking the arm drag on the far side.</p>
<p>First move that he used against his first opponent</p>
<p>earlier in the tournament.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s the leg.</p>
<p>Spins underneath it, goes circular,</p>
<p>rotates through,</p>
<p>gets his body weight underneath his opponent.</p>
<p>And now he&rsquo;s going to trip him down to the mat.</p>
<p>Now, I believe Nicky Riot tries to pull out his foot here.</p>
<p>And Craig also said that Nicky Riot has gotten used</p>
<p>to being able to pull that foot out from anybody.</p>
<p>And that he was very surprised at the grip</p>
<p>that Gordon was able to actually hold on.</p>
<p>So I just want to comment.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just parroting commentary.</p>
<p>If you look at what&rsquo;s happening here.</p>
<p>From the internet.</p>
<p>If you just freeze it,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll see that Gordon, like any good leg locker,</p>
<p>will always treat his opponent&rsquo;s foot</p>
<p>like a knot at the end of the rope.</p>
<p>Just as you slide down a rope,</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s a knot at the end, your hand will catch.</p>
<p>So too with the human leg.</p>
<p>When they go to extract by pulling,</p>
<p>you just keep your fist as close to your shoulder as possible</p>
<p>and narrow the gap.</p>
<p>The foot will always catch.</p>
<p>The failure that many people have</p>
<p>is they let their hand drift away from their own shoulder.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s room for the foot to extract.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;ll see Gordon&rsquo;s extremely disciplined</p>
<p>with thumb close to his own shoulder,</p>
<p>which creates a situation that&rsquo;s very, very hard</p>
<p>just to simply pull your foot out.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re focusing on the knot of the foot.</p>
<p>Yeah, also it&rsquo;s very early in the match.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s very little sweat.</p>
<p>Both athletes are still pretty dry.</p>
<p>Now Gordon has to climb the leg.</p>
<p>And now he&rsquo;s already captured his opponent&rsquo;s shoelace.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the heel exposure coming up.</p>
<p>Nicky Rod already knows things are getting bad.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s the win.</p>
<p>Actually, the comment I made,</p>
<p>I guess, was from a little bit earlier.</p>
<p>There was an earlier time</p>
<p>where Nicky Rod was trying to pull out the foot</p>
<p>and Gordon is able to hold onto the knot,</p>
<p>which is interesting.</p>
<p>Now, that was a brilliant day&rsquo;s work by Gordon Ryan.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s had two matches against opponents</p>
<p>considerably bigger and stronger than himself.</p>
<p>And the time of the two matches can be measured</p>
<p>in, I think, less than two minutes.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s done what he set out to do.</p>
<p>No injuries, no exhaustion.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s beaten four guys back to back,</p>
<p>all of whom are excellent athletes</p>
<p>with minimal energy expenditure.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s ready to go on to his super fight.</p>
<p>So, and that&rsquo;s against one of the greatest,</p>
<p>arguably, for a long time,</p>
<p>really, really up there jiu-jitsu practitioners,</p>
<p>competitors, grappling no-gi competitors of all time,</p>
<p>which is Andre Gavarro.</p>
<p>Yes, Andre Gavarro is almost certainly at this point</p>
<p>the greatest ADCC competitor of all time.</p>
<p>He won more super fights than anyone else</p>
<p>by a landslide.</p>
<p>So if I may just read a few words</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve written on Instagram about this match,</p>
<p>about Andre Gavarro, on greatness.</p>
<p>How great you become in any given endeavor</p>
<p>will always be assessed by the degree of difficulty</p>
<p>of the barriers you had to overcome to get to the top.</p>
<p>Just as the lion became king of the jungle,</p>
<p>not by living among sheep,</p>
<p>but by dominating a world of elephants, hyenas,</p>
<p>buffalo, leopards, crocodiles,</p>
<p>so too the greatness of an athlete will be determined</p>
<p>not just by his own ability,</p>
<p>but by the greatness of the athletes he faces.</p>
<p>Thus, in his quest for greatness,</p>
<p>Gordon Ryan owes a debt to the greatness</p>
<p>of his toughest opponent, Andre Gavarro.</p>
<p>And you go on to sing him praises.</p>
<p>So, and that introduces this match.</p>
<p>You know, there was an interesting moment.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t even listen to the words exchanged,</p>
<p>but because I had the great fortune</p>
<p>of sitting next to Hodger Gracie,</p>
<p>there was this fascinating moment before the match.</p>
<p>And I can&rsquo;t believe Gordon is sufficiently relaxed</p>
<p>to do this, but he walked up to Hodger Gracie</p>
<p>and had a discussion.</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve faced Hunter Gavarro before.</p>
<p>What are your suggestions?</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ve talked it back and forth.</p>
<p>They brainstormed ideas like minutes before the match.</p>
<p>And it was just a beautiful moment of like,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, like Tiger Woods and Michael Jordan</p>
<p>talking to each other, something like that.</p>
<p>I mean, I wonder how much brainstorming there really was</p>
<p>and how much was it just kind of like spiritual inspiration</p>
<p>or something like that.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think it&rsquo;s more spiritual inspiration.</p>
<p>He looks up to Hodger as a very close friend</p>
<p>and mentor of mine.</p>
<p>So I always tell my athletes,</p>
<p>look to Hodger as your example.</p>
<p>This is a guy who always fought for the finish.</p>
<p>He tried to express the highest ideal of jiu-jitsu,</p>
<p>which is control leading to submission</p>
<p>in every match he was ever in.</p>
<p>He even lost matches on tactics against people</p>
<p>that he could easily have defeated</p>
<p>if he adopted a different tactic.</p>
<p>But he always insisted on victory by submission.</p>
<p>It defined his career.</p>
<p>It made him who he was.</p>
<p>And I always try to have my athletes emulate him.</p>
<p>So what was the strategy going into this match?</p>
<p>What were you thinking?</p>
<p>What were you thinking?</p>
<p>Okay, for Andre Galvan,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a sense in which Andre Galvan had to fight</p>
<p>literally the perfect match to win this.</p>
<p>Okay, this is a match that&rsquo;s gonna be 20 minutes long</p>
<p>and potentially 40 minutes long.</p>
<p>Andre Galvan cannot win by submission.</p>
<p>Gordon&rsquo;s submission dominance here is just too great.</p>
<p>It would be exceedingly difficult</p>
<p>for him to win on the ground.</p>
<p>Gordon&rsquo;s ground positional game is just too advanced.</p>
<p>And so for Andre Galvan, he had to win.</p>
<p>If he was going to win,</p>
<p>it was going to be in a standing wrestling exchange</p>
<p>where most people assessed him</p>
<p>as having a measure of superiority over Gordon Ryan.</p>
<p>The problem is that it&rsquo;s hard</p>
<p>to just keep a potentially 40 minute match on the ground,</p>
<p>sorry, off the ground that whole time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very, very difficult indeed.</p>
<p>So he would have had to fight literally</p>
<p>the perfect tactical match to make it happen.</p>
<p>And he would have to do it</p>
<p>without getting called for stalling points.</p>
<p>Gordon has the luxury that if at any point</p>
<p>they go to the ground, he has complete dominance.</p>
<p>But Gordon too has a problem</p>
<p>that he can&rsquo;t pull guard without being penalized.</p>
<p>And if Andre Galvan can play this tactical game</p>
<p>of forcing Gordon to pull guard</p>
<p>and then staying at a distance where he doesn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s doing enough action not to get called for stalling</p>
<p>but not so much to engage</p>
<p>with the dangerous Gordon Ryan on the ground,</p>
<p>then it&rsquo;s feasible he could have won.</p>
<p>But it would have been, as I said,</p>
<p>it would have required the most perfect application</p>
<p>and integration of technique and tactics</p>
<p>that he&rsquo;s capable of.</p>
<p>How much intimidation was there?</p>
<p>Was there, or are these assets already beyond that?</p>
<p>When you say intimidation, be more precise.</p>
<p>Do you think there was some degree,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re just to empathize with Andre Galvan,</p>
<p>do you think there&rsquo;s some degree</p>
<p>in which Gordon was in his head?</p>
<p>Because of the trash talk leading up to certain events,</p>
<p>because of the level of dominance that Gordon has shown</p>
<p>in this competition and in the months</p>
<p>and years leading up to it.</p>
<p>Also the fact that Andre Galvan is also a coach</p>
<p>of a large team.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s some pressure to demonstrate to the team</p>
<p>that the old lion still got it.</p>
<p>Yeah, I can&rsquo;t speak for Andre,</p>
<p>but I know for Gordon,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard to be intimidated when you know</p>
<p>the other guy has no method of finishing you.</p>
<p>It just takes so much pressure off.</p>
<p>When you just go in there saying,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s literally no way this guy can finish me.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s no way this guy can pin and control me.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t be finished.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t be pinned and controlled.</p>
<p>The only way I can lose this</p>
<p>is if this guy plays a tactical game.</p>
<p>So in his best case scenario,</p>
<p>I lose by a tactical game.</p>
<p>But from Andre&rsquo;s perspective, it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>if I make one screw up, this kid could finish me.</p>
<p>You can see which way the intimidation game goes.</p>
<p>Now, for the start, things get interesting here.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve already said, if you could just freeze it right there,</p>
<p>Andre&rsquo;s only realistic path to victory</p>
<p>is standing grappling.</p>
<p>That would require him to take Gordon down,</p>
<p>presumably multiple times after the first 10 minutes,</p>
<p>and not be taken down at all by Gordon.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a tall order.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s possible, but difficult.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s where things get interesting.</p>
<p>I told Gordon before the match,</p>
<p>just go out and offer him the leg.</p>
<p>Same way you do with Nicky Rod.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where things get interesting.</p>
<p>I must say that I loved what Andre Galvan</p>
<p>did at the start of this match.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a little crazy here.</p>
<p>There was just so much energy in the room at this point</p>
<p>that his hand fighting got a little-</p>
<p>For people just listening,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a bit of hard slapping.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>That could be considered a strike.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>There was just a lot of electric atmosphere in the room.</p>
<p>So now things settle down a little bit.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s where things get interesting.</p>
<p>Andre throws the whole tactical game out the window</p>
<p>right from the start.</p>
<p>He goes for the takedown.</p>
<p>Gordon doesn&rsquo;t try to fight the takedown</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s in his interests to go to the ground.</p>
<p>But I love this about Andre.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s literally like, fuck you, kid.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see how good your ground game is.</p>
<p>So he shoots the takedown,</p>
<p>and Gordon accepts it, obviously,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s to his advantage to accept it.</p>
<p>But I love the fact that Andre was like,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not even gonna try and stall this out.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just gonna, bang, there it is.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s like, okay, let&rsquo;s see what you got, kid.</p>
<p>They say you&rsquo;re good on the ground.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see what you fucking got.</p>
<p>And I love that about Andre.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, he&rsquo;s entered the hornet&rsquo;s nest now.</p>
<p>What happened there real quick?</p>
<p>Because that was very-</p>
<p>Gordon immediately went into ashigurami.</p>
<p>Not just any ashigurami,</p>
<p>but ashigurami where he&rsquo;s holding both legs.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s in open guard and he&rsquo;s scooted forward.</p>
<p>Wow, that&rsquo;s really nice.</p>
<p>So he splits the legs.</p>
<p>Now he dominates the space between the knees.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a guaranteed straight ashigurami here.</p>
<p>He split the knees against Andre Galvao,</p>
<p>like effortlessly right there.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>So already, Gordon&rsquo;s in his preferred domain now.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s starting to off-balance his opponent.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s looking for a reaction to get heel exposure.</p>
<p>He does get heel exposure.</p>
<p>Andre does a good job of monitoring the feet</p>
<p>to try and reduce the breaking pressure.</p>
<p>But the brute fact is it&rsquo;s in Gordon&rsquo;s realm now.</p>
<p>This is where he has all the advantage.</p>
<p>So, and the match is gonna be 20 minutes in Gordon&rsquo;s realm.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s gonna be a very, very tall order.</p>
<p>Was there a moment here, again, Gordon&rsquo;s on the legs.</p>
<p>Are you impressed that Andre&rsquo;s able to get out</p>
<p>from this-</p>
<p>Andre, I would expect this.</p>
<p>Andre&rsquo;s been preparing for this for two years.</p>
<p>And remember, Andre has gone against some</p>
<p>of the greatest leg lockers in grappling before and prevailed.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s not naive.</p>
<p>You know, he knows how to defend himself.</p>
<p>The big problem is that he&rsquo;s gonna create</p>
<p>defensive reactions, which lead into other aspects</p>
<p>of Gordon&rsquo;s game, in particular, back exposure.</p>
<p>So here, ashigurami goes to like a single leg type</p>
<p>of position where Gordon runs to Andre&rsquo;s back.</p>
<p>Now he has to return him to the mat.</p>
<p>The most efficient way to do so is always courtesy</p>
<p>of foot sweeping.</p>
<p>So he pulls out a de-ashiharai from the back</p>
<p>to sweep him down to the mat.</p>
<p>And now Gordon&rsquo;s on top.</p>
<p>And this is a serious problem for any grappler in the world.</p>
<p>Once Gordon gets top position, he&rsquo;s just relentless.</p>
<p>But just getting Andre Gavar&rsquo;s good,</p>
<p>just getting the guard back, all of that,</p>
<p>is great.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also a sense here in which Gordon is pacing it too,</p>
<p>just to physically fatigue an opponent.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s passing the guard, but not rushing it.</p>
<p>Now what Gordon&rsquo;s looking for here is complete</p>
<p>chest-to-chest contact.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s getting very close to it now.</p>
<p>And once he gets chest-to-chest on an opponent</p>
<p>in top position, past one of his opponent&rsquo;s knees,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna be awfully, awfully difficult</p>
<p>for an opponent to recover.</p>
<p>What is he waiting for here?</p>
<p>Is this pressure here?</p>
<p>And over time, he just wears you out.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s part of a campaign of attrition,</p>
<p>of pressure over time.</p>
<p>Now he&rsquo;s creating a situation where he&rsquo;s either gonna get</p>
<p>back exposure or mount exposure.</p>
<p>And either way is pretty much fatal</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re dealing with Gordon.</p>
<p>Andre elected to go the route of back exposure.</p>
<p>Now Gordon got the body triangle, is on his back.</p>
<p>And now it&rsquo;s a&hellip;</p>
<p>Now there&rsquo;s one physical problem here,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s that Andre Galvan has a neck like a bull.</p>
<p>And he has a very short and very thick neck.</p>
<p>So penetrating under the chin for a strangle</p>
<p>can be a real problem.</p>
<p>He also has extremely well-developed shoulders</p>
<p>and upper arms.</p>
<p>So when the head comes down and the shoulders go up,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s very little real estate to work with,</p>
<p>with regards to your strangle holds.</p>
<p>So Gordon in time will trap one of his opponent&rsquo;s arms</p>
<p>with his legs in order to take away</p>
<p>one of those strong defensive arms.</p>
<p>There you can see the arm has been trapped</p>
<p>and now he can start-</p>
<p>Heating the body triangle.</p>
<p>Working towards the strangle.</p>
<p>And now here is still difficult.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s still difficult, but things are looking good.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s still considerable amount of time left on the clock.</p>
<p>Gordon is well ahead on points.</p>
<p>So all the pressure, all the tactical pressure</p>
<p>now is on Andre.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll see the critical penetration of the jaw.</p>
<p>With the wrist, yeah, wow, yeah.</p>
<p>Now Gordon elects for a one-handed strangle.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>Andre fought very bravely.</p>
<p>But a strangle, it doesn&rsquo;t matter how brave you are.</p>
<p>And where does the strangle actually happen in terms of,</p>
<p>it felt like the strangle was at the blade of the,</p>
<p>it wasn&rsquo;t even fully sunk in.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So where does, is that like a full comers,</p>
<p>like a one-handed choke?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a sense in which once you get underneath,</p>
<p>you know the inevitable follow-up is coming.</p>
<p>Again, the inevitable, you&rsquo;re feeling the inevitable.</p>
<p>To go back to your chess analogy,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like resigning in chess.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>In chess, it&rsquo;s considered almost like impolite</p>
<p>to let it run out when you understand.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>When you understand that death is on the horizon.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a lot of respect.</p>
<p>That was the beautiful thing.</p>
<p>With all the trash talk and everything like that,</p>
<p>Gordon always shows respect.</p>
<p>I love that about the drama of combat.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s trash talk in the beginning and respect at the end.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s, you know, when you feel someone,</p>
<p>Andre has great skills.</p>
<p>And when you grapple someone,</p>
<p>you feel just how skilled they are.</p>
<p>And whatever issues you had prior to the match evaporate</p>
<p>when you feel, okay, they&rsquo;re just like you.</p>
<p>They do the same moves and same kind of concepts.</p>
<p>And you see that there&rsquo;s more that bonds you together</p>
<p>than separates you.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the feeling at the end of most grappling matches.</p>
<p>So if we could talk about Giancarlo,</p>
<p>who had an incredible performance.</p>
<p>And I mean, there&rsquo;s a lot of things we can say.</p>
<p>We can probably go through his matches.</p>
<p>But if we could just talk without that</p>
<p>about some of the most impressive things he saw about him.</p>
<p>One of the things I think you mentioned elsewhere in here</p>
<p>is about confidence.</p>
<p>So one of the things you saw that could really benefit him</p>
<p>as an athlete and competitor is to build up his confidence.</p>
<p>Is there, can you speak to that?</p>
<p>First of all, I should give you some background.</p>
<p>Giancarlo Bodoni was a strong local black belt in Boston</p>
<p>teaching at Bonato Faria School.</p>
<p>When I would film instructional videos,</p>
<p>I would often talk to him</p>
<p>and talk to him about his competitions and training.</p>
<p>And he would do local competitions.</p>
<p>He was trying to go from Gi training,</p>
<p>which was the majority of his competitive background</p>
<p>into no Gi.</p>
<p>And he was struggling in local competitions,</p>
<p>especially with things like leg locking,</p>
<p>where he had no background in leg locking</p>
<p>and would often get submitted.</p>
<p>So as we worked together in instructional videos,</p>
<p>we would talk and discuss.</p>
<p>He would periodically come to the gym in New York City</p>
<p>and come in to work out with the guys.</p>
<p>And he often struggled in the training room.</p>
<p>He had no experience with things</p>
<p>like body lock guard passing.</p>
<p>And this used to mean that he was,</p>
<p>many of the training sessions didn&rsquo;t go well for him.</p>
<p>So he was always like a very polite,</p>
<p>well-spoken young man and worked hard.</p>
<p>When we went to Puerto Rico</p>
<p>and the team ended up drifting apart,</p>
<p>when we moved into Austin,</p>
<p>he said, you know, now that many of your athletes have left,</p>
<p>could I come down and train with you guys full time?</p>
<p>And I was like, yeah, I&rsquo;d love to.</p>
<p>I thought it&rsquo;d be a great training partner</p>
<p>for Gordon and Gary.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t really have any training partners at that point.</p>
<p>And sure enough, he literally just picked up</p>
<p>everything he had and moved down to Austin.</p>
<p>Now, anyone who just moves halfway across the country</p>
<p>to begin training, that already gets my respect right there.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a big commitment.</p>
<p>And he began training.</p>
<p>We put him on a training schedule</p>
<p>where first he had to cover up his big weaknesses.</p>
<p>He had limited attacks from bottom position.</p>
<p>He had poor leg lock defense,</p>
<p>and he was very, very vulnerable</p>
<p>to certain kinds of guard passing,</p>
<p>which weren&rsquo;t part of his experience.</p>
<p>This is all a year out from AGCC.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And we should also maybe give the spoiler,</p>
<p>which is he wins his division in a dominant fashion.</p>
<p>He also does incredibly well at the Absolute.</p>
<p>And yeah.</p>
<p>It was an amazing thing.</p>
<p>To give you an idea, when he first moved to Austin,</p>
<p>he competed in a WNO event,</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t think he scored a single point,</p>
<p>lost a couple of matches,</p>
<p>and including matches to people who were in this ADCC.</p>
<p>So he came out of that looking very depressed,</p>
<p>and he lost to Ken Andoate.</p>
<p>He lost to Mason Fowler.</p>
<p>So John Cutler always struck me</p>
<p>as someone who was positionally sound.</p>
<p>He had good guard retention, things like this,</p>
<p>but he had no offense.</p>
<p>He had no leg lock defense,</p>
<p>and he just wasn&rsquo;t able to assert authority on matches.</p>
<p>He was a guy who was always gonna be tough to beat</p>
<p>because it was hard to pass his guard, that kind of thing,</p>
<p>but he wasn&rsquo;t dangerous.</p>
<p>Can I ask you a question on that?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Because my interaction with him early on</p>
<p>when he came to Austin,</p>
<p>I remember he interacted with me a bunch on the mat,</p>
<p>showing me stuff,</p>
<p>but I wonder if that kindness</p>
<p>is a detriment to the confidence?</p>
<p>Is there some connection?</p>
<p>Again, confidence.</p>
<p>Killers can be nice, too.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Confidence comes from skill level,</p>
<p>and confidence is a much more rational thing</p>
<p>than most people ascribe it.</p>
<p>People think of confidence as like this esoteric,</p>
<p>ethereal element that you either have or you don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>when in fact, confidence is much more a reflection,</p>
<p>a rational reflection on your past experience,</p>
<p>and if you&rsquo;re successful with your past experience</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re expecting to compete in a situation</p>
<p>which is similar to your past experience,</p>
<p>and that past experience has mostly been successful,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll be confident.</p>
<p>Are you pretty confident that the sun will rise tomorrow?</p>
<p>Of course you are,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s done so every time in the past.</p>
<p>Now, there&rsquo;s no, as people like Hume pointed out,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no supreme rational reason for believing this,</p>
<p>but nonetheless, your confidence is high,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s the same thing in jiu-jitsu.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re performing well,</p>
<p>and skills are the reason for that,</p>
<p>your confidence will be high in the future,</p>
<p>regardless of what your mindset is.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not a question of, you know,</p>
<p>this personality does better in competition</p>
<p>or that personality.</p>
<p>Ultimately, it&rsquo;s gonna come down to your skills,</p>
<p>and your confidence will be a reflection</p>
<p>of your accumulation of skills.</p>
<p>So what was his journey like to a person who lost,</p>
<p>to a person who dominated the competition?</p>
<p>Yeah, first things first, we had to say,</p>
<p>okay, you&rsquo;ve got an obvious weakness, leg lock defense.</p>
<p>So every day in the gym, he would be taught,</p>
<p>okay, this is where you put your feet,</p>
<p>this is where you position your knees,</p>
<p>your point your knee this way, not this way.</p>
<p>Then he would have to start sparring situations</p>
<p>in leg locks, and have to work his way out.</p>
<p>Initially, these were like heartbreaking sessions for him,</p>
<p>where, I mean, I&rsquo;ve got to give that kid full credit.</p>
<p>Like he just worked his way through it patiently,</p>
<p>dealt with frustration, initial failures,</p>
<p>and just said, I&rsquo;m going to get better.</p>
<p>Can we just linger on that?</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the experience of those early training sessions</p>
<p>like from an athlete perspective?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s daunting, it&rsquo;s daunting.</p>
<p>Are you basically dealing with the rational thought</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re not going to ever be good?</p>
<p>Yeah, you&rsquo;re wondering, have I even got what it takes?</p>
<p>Think about it, he&rsquo;s an established player,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s been in an IBJF competition,</p>
<p>I believe he&rsquo;s a brown belt world champion in the Ghee.</p>
<p>And suddenly a group of kids that he&rsquo;s never even seen before</p>
<p>repeatedly submitting him with leg locks in the gym.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, man, this is terrible.</p>
<p>A year from now, I&rsquo;m supposed to fight ADCC</p>
<p>against people like Craig Jones,</p>
<p>some of the best leg lockers in the world.</p>
<p>It must&rsquo;ve been hard, but he just stayed in there</p>
<p>and no one worked harder than him.</p>
<p>He just was in the gym three times a day, studying every day</p>
<p>and unlike so many other people,</p>
<p>every time he was shown something,</p>
<p>he consciously and deliberately tried to enact it,</p>
<p>even at the price of initial failure.</p>
<p>Do you advise that that&rsquo;s a good way to go?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the only way to go.</p>
<p>Like if you can&rsquo;t wrap your head around the idea</p>
<p>that trying to acquire new skills</p>
<p>will create a temporary time</p>
<p>where your effectiveness diminishes</p>
<p>as you&rsquo;re trying to bring on new skills,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re never gonna make it</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;ll always stay at whatever skillset you are.</p>
<p>The whole mental trick is to imbue this idea</p>
<p>of delayed gratification that you have to accept</p>
<p>that when I bring on new moves,</p>
<p>my overall effectiveness will diminish,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s the belief that in time,</p>
<p>as my skill performance increases,</p>
<p>it will increase over time,</p>
<p>but it will come at the price</p>
<p>of initial frustration and failure.</p>
<p>And John Carlo made that mental switch early on</p>
<p>in his time in Austin</p>
<p>and to his credit, just stuck through.</p>
<p>Within a very short period of time,</p>
<p>he came very hard to leg lock</p>
<p>and even the best leg lockers in the room</p>
<p>had a hard time with him.</p>
<p>And that was the first step in confidence.</p>
<p>He said, okay, I&rsquo;m not getting finished quickly anymore.</p>
<p>Then he had to bring in a whole new set</p>
<p>of upper body submissions.</p>
<p>He neglected upper body submissions.</p>
<p>When you say upper body submissions,</p>
<p>do you mean the arm locks?</p>
<p>Strength holds, arm locks, things like this.</p>
<p>And in particular, he put very, very hard work</p>
<p>on his strangle holds.</p>
<p>He had always been someone who was positionally strong.</p>
<p>He could get to the back,</p>
<p>but he could never finish from the back.</p>
<p>And then suddenly in the gym,</p>
<p>he started finishing from the back.</p>
<p>And then his gym performance</p>
<p>against the lesser students increased</p>
<p>and you bump them up against better students.</p>
<p>And then this goes on all the way up</p>
<p>to the best guys in the room.</p>
<p>And in time, in a relatively short period of time,</p>
<p>there were significant increases in performance</p>
<p>and success begets success.</p>
<p>And this kept going.</p>
<p>We started to get a hint of his developing confidence</p>
<p>in local competitions.</p>
<p>I remember seeing John Carlo compete</p>
<p>in a local fight to win competition</p>
<p>against a tough Brazilian kid.</p>
<p>John Carlo just came out,</p>
<p>dominated and finished with a leg lock.</p>
<p>Now that was interesting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, okay, you&rsquo;re the guy</p>
<p>that used to get finished by leg locks</p>
<p>and now you&rsquo;re beating tough opponents with leg locks.</p>
<p>And that was an important psychological step</p>
<p>for John Carlo Badoni.</p>
<p>And with each little step as we went further and further,</p>
<p>then he got to ADCC trials</p>
<p>and had one of the great performances.</p>
<p>I believe he submitted all of his opponents in ADCC trials</p>
<p>and put on a fantastic display of grappling.</p>
<p>Shockingly, no one paid attention to it.</p>
<p>They were just like, oh yeah, he won.</p>
<p>And John Carlo flew into ADCC completely under the radar.</p>
<p>They just saw him as,</p>
<p>oh, he&rsquo;s the guy that won American trials.</p>
<p>And no one really paid much attention.</p>
<p>In his first match,</p>
<p>he took on a great Brazilian champion, Izaki,</p>
<p>and won in dominant fashion.</p>
<p>He was about to strangle him</p>
<p>with just a few seconds left on the clock.</p>
<p>And I remember John Carlo being furious</p>
<p>at the end of the match,</p>
<p>thinking like I was so close to finishing,</p>
<p>he wanted a perfect finish.</p>
<p>Up on points, six to nothing.</p>
<p>Yeah, and-</p>
<p>Still chasing.</p>
<p>Still chasing.</p>
<p>I mean, he could have just coasted at this point,</p>
<p>but he wanted to finish every one of his opponents.</p>
<p>And he got very, very close, but not quite there.</p>
<p>And then in his next match,</p>
<p>he had to take on the defending gold medalist</p>
<p>from the previous ADCC.</p>
<p>Yeah, Mateu Diniz.</p>
<p>This was the guy who was the favorite to win.</p>
<p>So you have a relatively unknown John Carlo</p>
<p>fighting the man who defeated Craig Jones</p>
<p>in the previous ADCC.</p>
<p>Do you remember what stood out to you about this match?</p>
<p>So Mateu Diniz is good wrestling, he&rsquo;s good at everything.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Good all around grappler.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s got, by jiu-jitsu standards,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a very strong wrestler.</p>
<p>So our intention was to match his wrestling</p>
<p>with John Carlo&rsquo;s judo skills.</p>
<p>So you will see, if we could perhaps go back,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll see the first takedown.</p>
<p>Arm drag.</p>
<p>And took him down with a simple dragon peck.</p>
<p>So that was John Carlo&rsquo;s first takedown.</p>
<p>That was more wrestling oriented</p>
<p>and good for his confidence to see</p>
<p>that he could score a nice takedown.</p>
<p>But Mateu Diniz is very, very good at standing up</p>
<p>from bottom position.</p>
<p>If we just go back just a step.</p>
<p>Okay, now here we have something interesting.</p>
<p>Mateu comes up from bottom, seizes a leg,</p>
<p>and John Carlo defends the wrestling move</p>
<p>and then goes immediately into-</p>
<p>What the fuck?</p>
<p>With a-</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of a mix of Sasai and Diyashi Hirai.</p>
<p>Wow, that was beautiful.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t even notice that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really nice.</p>
<p>Look at that.</p>
<p>From defending a single, threatening a guillotine.</p>
<p>One of the big themes of our ADCC camp</p>
<p>was that most of our opponents now</p>
<p>are getting very strong in hand fighting.</p>
<p>Look at that.</p>
<p>But they are not strong in foot fighting.</p>
<p>And so we put a very heavy emphasis on foot sweeping attacks.</p>
<p>You remember Gordon Ryan took down</p>
<p>Andre Galvant with a foot sweep.</p>
<p>And here you have John Carlo using the same technique,</p>
<p>not from the back, but from the front.</p>
<p>And an overhook.</p>
<p>Left hand post.</p>
<p>Catches the foot mid-air.</p>
<p>Look at.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s just a beautiful, beautiful takedown.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s beautiful judo.</p>
<p>And then-</p>
<p>And then later in the match,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll use a Kusarigake,</p>
<p>another classical judo takedown,</p>
<p>to get top position.</p>
<p>Now at one point, John Carlo was in trouble.</p>
<p>He got his back exposed.</p>
<p>With this situation.</p>
<p>Good.</p>
<p>Double leg to-</p>
<p>To a knee pick.</p>
<p>Knee pick.</p>
<p>So he has to expose his back</p>
<p>in order to avoid giving up takedown points.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s a defensive training</p>
<p>that we work on is coming through.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s defensively sound, shuts out the hook,</p>
<p>prevents the score.</p>
<p>Keeps his body at the right angle</p>
<p>to prevent a power half Nelson.</p>
<p>Staying calm.</p>
<p>Now he&rsquo;s got to turn this around.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of the hardest things to do in grappling.</p>
<p>How dangerous is it to put your-</p>
<p>In this position to put your hands on the ground?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s ordinarily, it could be dangerous</p>
<p>because your opponent could switch to an armbar.</p>
<p>Whoops, and there&rsquo;s the body lock.</p>
<p>Now there&rsquo;s some controversy here,</p>
<p>but you can clearly see it.</p>
<p>The hand is in the air.</p>
<p>The hand is in the air.</p>
<p>The hand is in the air.</p>
<p>And yet the hands were locked.</p>
<p>So it shouldn&rsquo;t really be as controversial</p>
<p>as people are saying.</p>
<p>Now watch for the right leg Kosarigake here.</p>
<p>Pulls in the hips, exposes the leg, boom, and down.</p>
<p>Beautiful Kosarigake.</p>
<p>Also probably a lesson that</p>
<p>complaining to a ref does not protect you</p>
<p>from a good takedown.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s why they say in combat sports,</p>
<p>defend yourself at all times.</p>
<p>But now the great advantage of judo takedowns</p>
<p>over wrestling leg tackles</p>
<p>is they confer upper body connection after the takedown,</p>
<p>which is very, very important for ADCC.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why we put such a heavy emphasis on them.</p>
<p>And now Giancarlo is absolutely in the driver&rsquo;s seat.</p>
<p>He just scored four points for that takedown.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s well ahead at this point</p>
<p>against the established favorite</p>
<p>for the entire weight division.</p>
<p>So now Matthias Denise has to start taking some risks.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s staring down the barrel of defeat</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s not that much time left.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s gonna set up the pressure.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s tactical pressure.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not physical pressure, it&rsquo;s tactical.</p>
<p>Matthias has to turn away</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s gonna create back exposure,</p>
<p>the most dangerous kind of exposure in ADCC.</p>
<p>Oh, there it is.</p>
<p>Mount the back.</p>
<p>And Giancarlo capitalizes.</p>
<p>Matthias is smart.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s keeping on his side</p>
<p>so that less than 75% of his back is on the floor</p>
<p>to deny the mount points.</p>
<p>But that comes at a price</p>
<p>and that price is back exposure.</p>
<p>So the thing we talked about with Gordon,</p>
<p>the circumstance of fate,</p>
<p>which is he has a lot of grueling tough matches</p>
<p>and still chooses to do absolute.</p>
<p>And he seems to just power through all of it.</p>
<p>How much of the calculation is how to survive the cardio,</p>
<p>the grueling cardio aspect of all of this?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a great question.</p>
<p>And the truth of the matter is</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t afford to pace yourself</p>
<p>because if you say,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna hold myself back for this match</p>
<p>in expectation of the others,</p>
<p>you could end up losing your first match.</p>
<p>So he didn&rsquo;t pace himself.</p>
<p>At all.</p>
<p>For any of the matches.</p>
<p>You have to just be in good shape</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what the camp is for.</p>
<p>Some of the mental or no?</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s mostly physical.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what the camp is for.</p>
<p>Like he&rsquo;s felt more pressure in the training room</p>
<p>than he felt in any of his matches.</p>
<p>But still sort of attacking.</p>
<p>Look at this.</p>
<p>That was a beautiful transition.</p>
<p>From back or from whatever the heck that position was,</p>
<p>right, from looking for the back,</p>
<p>transitioning here.</p>
<p>What the heck is this transition?</p>
<p>So Mateus is engaging in a very good tactic,</p>
<p>which is to get most of his back off the ground</p>
<p>to deny them the mount points.</p>
<p>So as back exposure starts to occur,</p>
<p>he turns in.</p>
<p>Threatening an arm lock.</p>
<p>Yeah, but you can see what&rsquo;s happening here.</p>
<p>As the left foot goes under,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna create a beautiful triangle entry.</p>
<p>Right foot penetrates through underneath the neck.</p>
<p>And now he&rsquo;s locking a triangle, a Senkaku,</p>
<p>but not just any triangle,</p>
<p>a triangle with the figure four locked</p>
<p>on the back of the opponent&rsquo;s head,</p>
<p>which makes any kind of stacking defense</p>
<p>very, very difficult.</p>
<p>It makes it very, very hard for an opponent to pull away</p>
<p>and creates a much tighter strangle than average.</p>
<p>And as a result, it&rsquo;s a quick submission.</p>
<p>Beautifully done.</p>
<p>Still chasing the submission.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>With a minute left up on points.</p>
<p>Against the former champion.</p>
<p>Against the former champion.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s match number two.</p>
<p>Now, that&rsquo;s the first day.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s Saturday.</p>
<p>So John Collar goes to sleep that night thinking,</p>
<p>okay, I just beat a world champion in my first match</p>
<p>and almost submitted him.</p>
<p>And I just submitted the defending champion.</p>
<p>So of course he wakes up on Sunday morning</p>
<p>feeling pretty damn good.</p>
<p>Now, there&rsquo;s an interesting twist here.</p>
<p>His opponent is a talented young Irishman</p>
<p>who won European trials, I believe,</p>
<p>almost entirely with leg locks.</p>
<p>And almost all of his major attacks in the tournament so far</p>
<p>have been leg locks.</p>
<p>Bear in mind that a year ago,</p>
<p>John Collar was losing to local blue belt competitors</p>
<p>via leg lock.</p>
<p>So in my mind, I&rsquo;m thinking, okay,</p>
<p>how&rsquo;s he gonna handle this?</p>
<p>Will the leg lock training kick in?</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ll see the result.</p>
<p>John Collar is on top, passing an open guard.</p>
<p>So you can see-</p>
<p>Keeping his legs away from any attacks.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>His opponent, Owen from Ireland,</p>
<p>is employing the same tactics that we made famous years ago.</p>
<p>The idea of sitting to butterfly guard</p>
<p>and looking to entangle the legs.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s kind of playing that game.</p>
<p>So John Collar is obviously used to this</p>
<p>from training in the gym.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s doing a good job of preventing entanglement,</p>
<p>controlling his opponent&rsquo;s shoelaces</p>
<p>and moving out to an angle</p>
<p>which limits his opponent&rsquo;s entry options.</p>
<p>So hands on the shoelaces and angles</p>
<p>is a good defense here.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an initial defense.</p>
<p>Now, his opponent wants to get</p>
<p>underneath the center of gravity.</p>
<p>So John Collar wants to get outside the line of his legs.</p>
<p>At some point, your opponent&rsquo;s going to entangle.</p>
<p>If he&rsquo;s determined to entangle,</p>
<p>at some point it&rsquo;s going to happen.</p>
<p>So John Collar decides, okay, let&rsquo;s let it happen</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s see where his feet go</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s see how disciplined he is with his feet.</p>
<p>And the opponent is inverted.</p>
<p>Here, he does a good job getting behind John Collar&rsquo;s knee.</p>
<p>So now they&rsquo;re fully locked in.</p>
<p>So John Collar moves away to protect the heel,</p>
<p>rotates out, controls his shoelace.</p>
<p>Now, at this point, the Irishman&rsquo;s starting to lose</p>
<p>discipline with his own foot position, okay?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s so focused on his own attack</p>
<p>that he&rsquo;s starting to get a little sloppy</p>
<p>with his own foot position.</p>
<p>You see, he&rsquo;s assuming, oh, I&rsquo;m the guy who&rsquo;s attacking,</p>
<p>so my opponent will be afraid of my leg locks</p>
<p>and is starting to make some small tactical errors</p>
<p>that John Collar will be able to take advantage of.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s threatening the sort of the north-south passer,</p>
<p>like, yeah, he&rsquo;s not putting too much pressure on the pass</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re still pretty early in the match</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s not ready to score yet.</p>
<p>So here again, he turns away his heel.</p>
<p>Now his opponent&rsquo;s starting to get more and more cavalier</p>
<p>with his foot positioning to a point</p>
<p>where now it&rsquo;s just downright sloppy.</p>
<p>So John Collar sees it, identifies it,</p>
<p>locks up a wrist-to-wrist toehold, and breaks his foot.</p>
<p>How?</p>
<p>Where&rsquo;s the, dumb question, where&rsquo;s the control here?</p>
<p>How is he?</p>
<p>The control comes from his opponent.</p>
<p>The entanglement is his opponent&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>His opponent is holding his own body in place</p>
<p>with his own legs.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s the root of his own problem here.</p>
<p>So you got sloppy, well done, well done.</p>
<p>And a little smile from John Collar, that&rsquo;s very nice.</p>
<p>The reason for that smile, you can probably guess,</p>
<p>is because a year ago, this would have been a disaster.</p>
<p>And now instead, it&rsquo;s a guaranteed ticket to the finals</p>
<p>in either a gold or a silver medal.</p>
<p>And so you can see in that compressed moment,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the look of a man who&rsquo;s made,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s just recognized just how much progress he&rsquo;s made</p>
<p>in what was once a weakness in roughly 10 months,</p>
<p>was the time it took.</p>
<p>And so he faces Lucas Hulk Barbosa in the final here.</p>
<p>Now these two have a history.</p>
<p>Hulk has beaten John Collar many times.</p>
<p>And so for John Collar, it&rsquo;s a question of,</p>
<p>okay, here I&rsquo;m matched up against a guy</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s repeatedly beaten me.</p>
<p>How am I gonna turn this around now?</p>
<p>And in terms of, we talked earlier about confidence.</p>
<p>If confidence was just a mental thing,</p>
<p>John Collar never would have won this fight.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;ve lost all those times to an athlete,</p>
<p>words aren&rsquo;t gonna change anything.</p>
<p>But you can see right from the start,</p>
<p>when they get into the hand fight,</p>
<p>John Collar is much more tactically adept</p>
<p>with his hand fighting.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s doing a good job of controlling his opponent&rsquo;s hands,</p>
<p>preventing any kind of prolonged pressure on the head.</p>
<p>And Hulk gets a sense here in which he realizes</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s fighting a very different person.</p>
<p>And this goes a long time.</p>
<p>Again, another super grueling match.</p>
<p>Wrestling.</p>
<p>That eventually leads to a back take here, back triangle.</p>
<p>Body triangle, I apologize.</p>
<p>Here you can see the same tactics</p>
<p>utilized by Gordon Ryan.</p>
<p>Back control based around the body triangle.</p>
<p>Many attempts to try and entrap his opponent&rsquo;s arm</p>
<p>and take away those defensive arms.</p>
<p>The main difference here is, again,</p>
<p>you have an athlete with a very powerful, compact neck.</p>
<p>So neck penetration is very important.</p>
<p>Neck penetration is difficult.</p>
<p>And so John Collar will switch to a palm to palm strangle</p>
<p>instead of the conventional figure four.</p>
<p>And now there&rsquo;s eight minutes left.</p>
<p>So all the time in the world.</p>
<p>Is it only just a matter of time at this point</p>
<p>in situations like this?</p>
<p>Yeah, John Collar has a massive tactical lead in points.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s literally no way he could lose this match</p>
<p>at this point.</p>
<p>Even if his opponent did get out of here</p>
<p>and take him down,</p>
<p>John Collar would still be ahead on points.</p>
<p>So this question,</p>
<p>the question now is not whether John Collar</p>
<p>will get the gold medal,</p>
<p>but whether John Collar will get it by submission.</p>
<p>And there it is.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the penetration of the neck</p>
<p>and he can&rsquo;t get the figure four,</p>
<p>so he opts for palm to palm instead.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s the submission.</p>
<p>Now-</p>
<p>John Collar is a relatively unemotional man,</p>
<p>but you can see there&rsquo;s emotion.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not fake, that&rsquo;s genuine.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the emotions of a man</p>
<p>who 10 months ago couldn&rsquo;t have done that.</p>
<p>And then 10 months later,</p>
<p>by dent of his own hard work and dedication</p>
<p>and his ability to actively attack his weaknesses</p>
<p>and turn them into strengths</p>
<p>and then develop an ability to finish,</p>
<p>that was a truly, truly remarkable achievement.</p>
<p>Let me ask you about Gary Tonin.</p>
<p>So he is one of the,</p>
<p>at least in my opinion,</p>
<p>greatest submission grapplers of all time.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of components to that.</p>
<p>But he lost in his first match.</p>
<p>Not only did Gary lose,</p>
<p>he lost to the bottom seed of his division.</p>
<p>And that in itself is something pretty remarkable</p>
<p>about what&rsquo;s happening in ADCC,</p>
<p>how there&rsquo;s a sense in which the days of</p>
<p>the invited athletes being far superior</p>
<p>to the trials winners are over.</p>
<p>It was a clear signal that anyone who makes it to ADCC</p>
<p>can beat the best people.</p>
<p>Sam McNally is a very talented submission grappler</p>
<p>from Ireland.</p>
<p>He specializes mostly in armbars,</p>
<p>but he has a good positional game as well.</p>
<p>Has a very modern look to his jujitsu.</p>
<p>And he did a fantastic job against Gary Tonin.</p>
<p>I think tactically,</p>
<p>Gary perhaps got a little far away from</p>
<p>his true nature in grappling,</p>
<p>which is relentless submission attack.</p>
<p>And perhaps I should be given blame for this</p>
<p>because I put such a heavy emphasis</p>
<p>on the training camp overall on positional pressure</p>
<p>that I feel that worked very well</p>
<p>for all of the athletes except Gary Tonin.</p>
<p>Interesting, so you have to acknowledge</p>
<p>the nature of the athlete part.</p>
<p>And I think I was coaching so hard</p>
<p>to the new people in the room on positional pressure</p>
<p>that I neglected Gary&rsquo;s innate ability to,</p>
<p>the fact that he does best</p>
<p>when he attacks exclusively by submission.</p>
<p>So I think if anyone should get blamed</p>
<p>for the failure here, it should be me.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s another comment as maybe I&rsquo;m over,</p>
<p>overvaluing sort of just the physical aspect of this,</p>
<p>but it seemed like Gary looked skinny.</p>
<p>Is the weight cut difficult here?</p>
<p>This is the first time he ever went down to the 66 kilos.</p>
<p>So it wasn&rsquo;t critical.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s other guys who are bigger than him</p>
<p>who made the weight.</p>
<p>But the weight cut, if you can just comment on,</p>
<p>does that ever play a part in the athlete&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>the physical and the mental aspect of the weight cut?</p>
<p>It is a thing in wrestling that could break</p>
<p>even some of the toughest minds.</p>
<p>Yeah, but no, it wasn&rsquo;t a weight cut</p>
<p>that would break someone like Gary Tonin.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more physical.</p>
<p>You train lighter and weaker.</p>
<p>You tend to get injured more in camp</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re lighter.</p>
<p>We have a team now after the breakout</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s mostly comprised of people over 215 pounds.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s very few small people left in the gym.</p>
<p>Most of the smaller athletes went to B team.</p>
<p>So Gary&rsquo;s been struggling a little bit</p>
<p>with training partners.</p>
<p>But here I think the chief problem was that</p>
<p>Gary focused perhaps a little too much</p>
<p>on the positional tactical game</p>
<p>and got away from his true gift,</p>
<p>which is relentless hunting for submissions.</p>
<p>And as I said, I think the person to blame for that is me</p>
<p>because I had to put so much emphasis</p>
<p>on the positional game for the developing athletes</p>
<p>that I didn&rsquo;t pay enough attention</p>
<p>to Gary&rsquo;s unique attributes.</p>
<p>So this, I mentioned I posted some stuff on Reddit.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a relevant question here.</p>
<p>Somebody on Reddit asked, Gordon has said,</p>
<p>and perhaps you have said as well,</p>
<p>that there are two types of jiu-jitsu practitioners,</p>
<p>ones who move themselves around like Marcel Garcia</p>
<p>and ones that control the motion of their opponents</p>
<p>like Gordon.</p>
<p>What are the strengths and weaknesses of each approach?</p>
<p>And how do those different approaches apply</p>
<p>depending on which weight class you&rsquo;re in?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a great set of questions.</p>
<p>Yes, I&rsquo;m the person who promulgates this idea</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s two broad ways you can go in jiu-jitsu.</p>
<p>You can either focus on promoting your own movement</p>
<p>to create opportunity</p>
<p>or by restricting the other person&rsquo;s movement.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a slower, less athletic opponent,</p>
<p>then you should definitely focus on the idea</p>
<p>of restricting the other fellow&rsquo;s movement.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how slow unathletic people win in jiu-jitsu.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re quick with the ability to change direction,</p>
<p>stand up quickly, go down quickly and move like a leopard,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re almost always better off generating movement</p>
<p>in order to create opportunity.</p>
<p>So, one is based more on movement</p>
<p>as the source of opportunity.</p>
<p>One is based more upon pressure</p>
<p>as the source of opportunity.</p>
<p>So, you&rsquo;ll get someone like Gary Tonin</p>
<p>or the Rua Tolo brothers.</p>
<p>Their game is based around the idea</p>
<p>of promoting their own movement to create opportunity.</p>
<p>Whereas someone like Gordon Ryan or Hodra Gracie</p>
<p>is about restricting movement</p>
<p>and using that pressure to create reactive opportunity.</p>
<p>Those are the two paths you can take in jiu-jitsu.</p>
<p>Because our team now has become mostly associated</p>
<p>with people over 200 pounds</p>
<p>and because most of them were beginners,</p>
<p>I took the more high percentage approach of,</p>
<p>okay, let&rsquo;s focus primarily</p>
<p>on controlling the other fellow&rsquo;s movement.</p>
<p>But Gary&rsquo;s a unique individual</p>
<p>and I feel like I let him down</p>
<p>by not giving him special attention</p>
<p>in regards to what he does.</p>
<p>The fact that you&rsquo;ve mentioned this now</p>
<p>like four times in the span of a few minutes,</p>
<p>just, I love that,</p>
<p>that all of this stuff weighs so heavy on you.</p>
<p>And he is a truly special person</p>
<p>and it is truly interesting to see</p>
<p>what is the nature of a particular athlete</p>
<p>that if you highlight makes them shine.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go to the part where Gary actually loses the match.</p>
<p>Okay, so the match is pretty innocuous at this point.</p>
<p>The guy does a good job of turning into the arm</p>
<p>and Gary gets caught reaching from the knees.</p>
<p>Okay, that&rsquo;s always a mistake.</p>
<p>And the guy does,</p>
<p>I think does a great job capitalizing on it.</p>
<p>Now there&rsquo;s limited time left on the clock.</p>
<p>This guy realizes, oh, this is my opportunity.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s got good flexibility and he gets the hook.</p>
<p>So if he just frees it right there.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a minute and a half left</p>
<p>and typically in ADCC, if you get the bag,</p>
<p>you score three points.</p>
<p>So this is a huge score.</p>
<p>For Gary to win here, it&rsquo;s gotta be by submission.</p>
<p>Okay, so Gary&rsquo;s made one mistake.</p>
<p>Now this talented young fellow from Ireland</p>
<p>does a great job, not only of getting the bag,</p>
<p>but he really attacks well from the back.</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s look at the depth</p>
<p>of Gary Tonin&rsquo;s defensive acumen here.</p>
<p>And we should say leading up to this,</p>
<p>his defense is incredible.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>He keeps escaping every position.</p>
<p>Our nickname for Gary is the Slippery Salmon</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s like trying to hold a goddamn salmon</p>
<p>on the riverbank, trying to hold onto this kid.</p>
<p>So he gets into a position</p>
<p>which looks absolutely hopeless here.</p>
<p>It gets worse.</p>
<p>This is already bad.</p>
<p>But&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of the most fun things to watch</p>
<p>about Gary is the skill and the escapes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s incredible.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s beautiful to watch.</p>
<p>So the guy has an excellent opportunity</p>
<p>to transition off here into a rear triangle,</p>
<p>which is one of the hardest things</p>
<p>in the world to get out of.</p>
<p>And from here, if this was anyone but Gary Tonin,</p>
<p>I think it would have been curtains.</p>
<p>But you see Gary just extends,</p>
<p>keeps his arm at just the right angle</p>
<p>to pop out and gets out.</p>
<p>So now Gary&rsquo;s like, oh crap,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to lose to this fucking guy.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s got a minute left to do something.</p>
<p>So he goes back into his submission mode.</p>
<p>He goes back to who Gary Tonin is</p>
<p>and immediately goes into leg lock action.</p>
<p>Now the young man from Ireland realizes,</p>
<p>hey, I&rsquo;m going to win this match</p>
<p>against the number one seed.</p>
<p>So Gary goes into the legs,</p>
<p>gets to one of his favorite techniques,</p>
<p>the heel hook.</p>
<p>Now Gary has a brutal heel hook as heck</p>
<p>and gets real pressure on the kid&rsquo;s leg.</p>
<p>Oh, I can&rsquo;t, oh, oh, that&rsquo;s hard to watch.</p>
<p>Yeah, but to his credit, the kid is smart.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, you know what, let me,</p>
<p>he just let me take some, let me take some time.</p>
<p>Wait, is there a weakness to that?</p>
<p>Like where he turned his hips?</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s unclear from the video</p>
<p>whether Gary&rsquo;s arm slipped up.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s considerable breaking pressure.</p>
<p>Oh, it slipped, I see.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s unclear.</p>
<p>Even before the slip.</p>
<p>But sometimes the heel can slip</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s, because something&rsquo;s popped.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s unclear what happened there.</p>
<p>There seems to be a reaction from the part of the opponent.</p>
<p>Like it definitely did some damage.</p>
<p>So Gary goes back for a second one.</p>
<p>Oh no.</p>
<p>And again, you get that same kind of pressure.</p>
<p>Oh no.</p>
<p>Oh, right.</p>
<p>I like the Irish kid&rsquo;s reaction though.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s just like, you know what, let me eat this</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m going to win this match</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m going to be a legend for beating Gary Turner.</p>
<p>So I admired his internal fortitude.</p>
<p>And, but now Gary knows he&rsquo;s lost it.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a sense there in which you see how close it gets</p>
<p>in these situations,</p>
<p>how little there is between winner and loser.</p>
<p>And sometimes you just get these heartbreaking situations</p>
<p>where someone who ordinarily</p>
<p>you would probably do very well against</p>
<p>and you make one mistake</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s an unrewarding, uncompromising sport.</p>
<p>One mistake can be fatal.</p>
<p>In class, you talked about escapes for arm locks</p>
<p>and it applies here as well.</p>
<p>So you were teaching arm lock escapes</p>
<p>and I think choke escapes.</p>
<p>And the question came up,</p>
<p>well, when should an athlete not tap</p>
<p>and risk their arm being broken?</p>
<p>And you quoted George Patton, as of course you would,</p>
<p>that no bastard ever won a war by dying for his country.</p>
<p>He won it by making some other bastard die for his country.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s your view on when to tap</p>
<p>and when not to tap in competition?</p>
<p>First off, in training, you should be tapping very early</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re not getting paid to fight in the gym.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re getting paid to fight on stage.</p>
<p>So be a professional in the gym, tap early, tap fast.</p>
<p>That way you&rsquo;ll last a lot longer.</p>
<p>In competition, things are a little different.</p>
<p>We also have to specify what is the situation, okay?</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re in the first round of ADCC,</p>
<p>your first match, you get caught,</p>
<p>I would always expect my students to tap</p>
<p>because if you get your leg broken</p>
<p>or your arm broken in the first round,</p>
<p>you still got three more matches before you get to the final.</p>
<p>There is a escape clause there</p>
<p>is if you&rsquo;re a guy from Ireland</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re fighting the number one seed.</p>
<p>There is always an escape clause, yeah.</p>
<p>Like let it snap.</p>
<p>Yeah, let it go.</p>
<p>But-</p>
<p>Your students, yes.</p>
<p>Yeah, I would expect them to tap.</p>
<p>I also think that if you&rsquo;re in a stranglehold,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t make a lot of sense in not tapping</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re gonna pass out.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like you said in chess,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of impolite to make the guy</p>
<p>take it through to his conclusion.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t see any heroism</p>
<p>and just letting yourself pass out.</p>
<p>Now, things change when you get into a final.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re in a final and you&rsquo;re ahead on points</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re willing to,</p>
<p>most people at that point are gonna be willing</p>
<p>to let something break in order to win a gold medal.</p>
<p>At that point, I leave it up to the student.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a deeply personal decision.</p>
<p>I would never say to a student,</p>
<p>I expect you to let your body break</p>
<p>in order to win a gold medal.</p>
<p>I think my students are more than mature enough</p>
<p>to make up their own minds.</p>
<p>I would be angry if they let their bodies break</p>
<p>in a meaningless fashion,</p>
<p>in some random tournament</p>
<p>or in a first round match</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s no way you could go on</p>
<p>to the second, third and fourth matches</p>
<p>with a broken limb.</p>
<p>But in a final, in a gold medal match, in ADCC,</p>
<p>I would leave the decision to them</p>
<p>a spontaneous decision in the moment.</p>
<p>I would be confident that I had prepared them</p>
<p>to do their very best to defend themselves.</p>
<p>But what ultimately they do is their decision.</p>
<p>And winning ADCC is, for a grappler at least,</p>
<p>life-changing.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a world champion forever.</p>
<p>And no one can ever take that moment away from you.</p>
<p>So I would understand if they took a decision</p>
<p>to take damage.</p>
<p>Hopefully it will never come to that</p>
<p>because I do a good job of preparing people</p>
<p>to get out of situations as you saw with Gary Turner.</p>
<p>He was in a dreadful situation</p>
<p>and got out within five seconds.</p>
<p>I saw that.</p>
<p>Gary&rsquo;s been in arm locks that looked like</p>
<p>even I was in the corner going like,</p>
<p>oh my God, what is happening here?</p>
<p>And still got out.</p>
<p>So it comes down to training preparation.</p>
<p>But if they did make that decision,</p>
<p>I would understand,</p>
<p>provided it was a situation</p>
<p>that would make their lives better.</p>
<p>And they made a calculation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not an emotional thing.</p>
<p>Now, sometimes you get emotional.</p>
<p>You fight a guy you just don&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>and you just don&rsquo;t wanna tap to him.</p>
<p>Then things get a little more interesting.</p>
<p>Then, again, it&rsquo;s a personal decision.</p>
<p>If you hate someone so much</p>
<p>that you literally can&rsquo;t even conceive of yourself</p>
<p>submitting to them,</p>
<p>probably best you don&rsquo;t get into matches with them</p>
<p>in the first place.</p>
<p>But if it should happen,</p>
<p>again, it comes down to the student.</p>
<p>I teach technique, not morals.</p>
<p>So I let people make their own decisions on that.</p>
<p>My thing is, look, don&rsquo;t get injured.</p>
<p>Because if you&rsquo;re injured, you can&rsquo;t train.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t train, you can&rsquo;t get better.</p>
<p>So stay away from injury as much as you can.</p>
<p>So one of the other incredible stories here is,</p>
<p>as you mentioned,</p>
<p>Nicholas Meragali,</p>
<p>one of the incredible gi athletes in jiu-jitsu world,</p>
<p>not ever having done no gi training or competition</p>
<p>and so on in a period of a year.</p>
<p>Actually, it&rsquo;s significantly less than a year.</p>
<p>Nicholas only came about six months,</p>
<p>I believe, before ADCC.</p>
<p>As a phone call came from Gordon,</p>
<p>he was just like, okay,</p>
<p>Nicholas wants to come down and train.</p>
<p>He wants to move to Austin.</p>
<p>So he came down.</p>
<p>It was funny.</p>
<p>I remember the first day Nicholas came in,</p>
<p>Nicholas Meragali, as you can see,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s this tall, handsome Brazilian guy</p>
<p>with a great personality and a wonderful smile.</p>
<p>Also a super nice guy.</p>
<p>So he comes in, he sits down on the mat</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re all kind of looking at the new guy</p>
<p>and introducing ourselves.</p>
<p>And I look at him and I go,</p>
<p>buddy, what the fuck are you doing here?</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like, what do you mean?</p>
<p>And I go like, look at you.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like tall and good looking.</p>
<p>You should be a fucking model, not a jiu-jitsu guy.</p>
<p>Look at us.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re all fucked up with horrible bodies</p>
<p>and bad personalities.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like a happy, good looking guy.</p>
<p>You should be surrounded by supermodels.</p>
<p>What are you doing jiu-jitsu for?</p>
<p>And he just laughed and he started training with us.</p>
<p>So he came in.</p>
<p>Now, historically, he has been an athlete</p>
<p>who always pulled guard.</p>
<p>In jiu-jitsu parlance for your viewers,</p>
<p>in jiu-jitsu you have the option</p>
<p>of sitting down to the ground.</p>
<p>Jiu-jitsu was mostly performed on the ground.</p>
<p>And many athletes take advantage of this.</p>
<p>They just come out and sit to the ground position</p>
<p>and completely forego takedowns.</p>
<p>Nicholas did this his entire career.</p>
<p>Jiu-jitsu also is practiced both gi and no-gi.</p>
<p>Nicholas was a shining light in the gi side of jiu-jitsu.</p>
<p>He was one of the great champions of his era.</p>
<p>But he had not only never competed without a gi,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;d never even trained without a gi.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s significant differences between the two.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of overlap,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s also some very significant differences.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking about a sport where even small differences</p>
<p>can make a difference between a guy</p>
<p>who gets the gold medal versus a guy</p>
<p>who loses his first match.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t take a lot.</p>
<p>So this was a very, very tall order.</p>
<p>Yeah, a lot of his attacks involve the gi from guard.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s in a very dangerous attack.</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t just wear the gi, he really uses the gi.</p>
<p>Like 90% of what he&rsquo;s based around</p>
<p>is based around a combination of cross</p>
<p>and straight collar controls</p>
<p>with the control of the sleeve cuff.</p>
<p>And so he really actively uses the gi.</p>
<p>So when it came off, his first training decisions</p>
<p>were like, oh, he looked like a fish out of water.</p>
<p>In addition, he had no experience of leg locking.</p>
<p>So one of the most significant parts of the modern game,</p>
<p>he just had nothing.</p>
<p>Plus the wrestling.</p>
<p>He had literally zero wrestling,</p>
<p>which is half of ADCC is based around this.</p>
<p>So ADCC is like six months away,</p>
<p>and he has to get ready for the gi world championships.</p>
<p>Nicholas had won many accolades in gi jiu-jitsu,</p>
<p>but he had never won the open weight division of gi world.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s like, the first day he&rsquo;s there, he&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>John, I wanna be the first guy to win gi open weight</p>
<p>and ADCC open weight in the same year.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like,</p>
<p>yeah.</p>
<p>Now in my mind, I&rsquo;m thinking like,</p>
<p>yeah, that&rsquo;s never gonna fucking happen,</p>
<p>you fucking weirdo.</p>
<p>Do you think there was a degree</p>
<p>to which he actually believed that?</p>
<p>A degree.</p>
<p>He thought it was like a certainty.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s looking at me like, yeah, I&rsquo;m gonna do this.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m like, well, Nicholas, this is very laudable</p>
<p>and I approve of your confidence,</p>
<p>but this is a difficult goal you&rsquo;ve set yourself.</p>
<p>But perhaps maybe like 2024 would be a more realistic.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, no, no, I&rsquo;m gonna do it.</p>
<p>In all seriousness, it is incredible</p>
<p>that Nicholas Meragali had the guts</p>
<p>to set such a nearly impossible goal.</p>
<p>So what do you learn from this experience</p>
<p>of setting a goal that most people would say</p>
<p>is just unachievable and him actually almost doing it?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s on the surface, just absolutely crazy.</p>
<p>Like when he mentioned the goal to me,</p>
<p>I was, as I said, just looking at him</p>
<p>and almost like disbelief.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t wanna show it on my face.</p>
<p>And yet he came within inches of actually doing it.</p>
<p>He won his first ever gold in the open weight with the Gi</p>
<p>and got to the finals and lost a tight decision</p>
<p>in the finals to take a silver medal.</p>
<p>He wanted two golds, he got a gold and a silver.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a sense in which the sheer audaciousness</p>
<p>of the goal set seemed ludicrous when it first happened.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, this is insanity.</p>
<p>And yet he came at it with a plan.</p>
<p>He came at it with his characteristic passion and hard work</p>
<p>and came within inches of doing so.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a sense in which you could look at it</p>
<p>as, oh, he had a plan and it failed.</p>
<p>And yet, of course, no one in their right mind</p>
<p>would look at it that way.</p>
<p>They would say he set an audacious goal</p>
<p>so high that it seemed impossible</p>
<p>and it pulled his entire performance up to a level</p>
<p>where even failure creates something truly memorable.</p>
<p>Do you encourage athletes</p>
<p>or do you not get in their way when they set such a goal?</p>
<p>Maybe even just, forget athletes, human nature.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s a great question.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a sense in which you don&rsquo;t wanna make people</p>
<p>delusional, that said, but I do believe</p>
<p>that if people are sufficiently embedded</p>
<p>in a given project, if they&rsquo;re committed to it</p>
<p>to a certain degree, then you can skimp on many things</p>
<p>in life, but don&rsquo;t skimp on your goals.</p>
<p>Because the bigger your goals,</p>
<p>the bigger your achievements will be.</p>
<p>And even failure, as we saw in the case</p>
<p>of Nicholas Miragalli, I almost frowned to use</p>
<p>the word failure because if this is failure,</p>
<p>give me more of it.</p>
<p>Falling slightly short of perfection.</p>
<p>Falling short of what would otherwise be a perfect year.</p>
<p>Even that still creates such a massive uptick</p>
<p>in your performance that it&rsquo;s absolutely</p>
<p>the right way to go.</p>
<p>But there is a danger to this where people aren&rsquo;t committed</p>
<p>and simply aren&rsquo;t working from a framework</p>
<p>where they can realistically achieve these things.</p>
<p>Then it descends into delusion</p>
<p>and that direction goes towards madness.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t have that.</p>
<p>So there has to be some kind of reality check here</p>
<p>where you have to be physically and mentally capable</p>
<p>to some degree of moving towards these goals.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t just, you know, a random blue belt</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t make audacious goals like that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just ludicrous.</p>
<p>But with that in mind, if you&rsquo;re committed</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a sense in which this is a definite possibility,</p>
<p>set your goals high.</p>
<p>Okay, make big demands.</p>
<p>Yes, there&rsquo;ll be times of frustration,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;ll be more failure in your lives than otherwise,</p>
<p>but even your failures will be something great,</p>
<p>something memorable.</p>
<p>See, but in the near term,</p>
<p>you would be hard-pressed to find any data</p>
<p>that justifies that goal.</p>
<p>Because in his case, he probably wasn&rsquo;t very good</p>
<p>at Nogi even in the training room.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like, where do you look for even inklings of hope?</p>
<p>We saw an incremental progress</p>
<p>with each successive competition that he was in.</p>
<p>His first competition, he looked good, but not great.</p>
<p>Second competition, a little better.</p>
<p>Third competition, took on one of the legends</p>
<p>of American grappling and won decisively.</p>
<p>So there was a sense in which it was becoming</p>
<p>more realistic with each outing.</p>
<p>So now putting that inspiring philosophy aside,</p>
<p>what was the actual plan on how to make it happen?</p>
<p>So the leg locks.</p>
<p>First, same thing with Giancarlo.</p>
<p>First, you gotta learn how to defend a leg lock.</p>
<p>So initially, just as Giancarlo struggled, he struggled.</p>
<p>Then he had to learn not just takedowns,</p>
<p>but just how to set up a takedown.</p>
<p>He had to learn basics like stance and motion</p>
<p>and how to fight with the hands, et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p>So he had to learn from the ground up.</p>
<p>And then he had to improve.</p>
<p>He always had a very good triangle,</p>
<p>always had a very good armbar.</p>
<p>Those were his two strengths coming into the no-gi training.</p>
<p>And those translate pretty well between gi and no-gi.</p>
<p>But he had no guillotine, he had no,</p>
<p>his strangles from the back were,</p>
<p>he has great collar strangles from the back,</p>
<p>but he really, really struggled</p>
<p>with finishing people from the back.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s learning all this, and then he&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>well, now I gotta get ready for the gi.</p>
<p>So we had to switch his training to gi training,</p>
<p>and that took out a couple of months.</p>
<p>Then he went back briefly to Brazil</p>
<p>and got a terrible rib injury</p>
<p>right before the world championships</p>
<p>and came back more or less unable to move.</p>
<p>So the world championships is a week away,</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s like, John, I can&rsquo;t move.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m like, what are you gonna do?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, I&rsquo;m gonna compete.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m like, are you sure?</p>
<p>So we fly to California.</p>
<p>He goes out and competes.</p>
<p>His first opponent is literally the biggest man</p>
<p>who competes in jiu-jitsu.</p>
<p>This man is almost like 400 pounds.</p>
<p>Nicholas has got completely broken ribs.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re taping up his ribs backstage</p>
<p>before he goes out to compete.</p>
<p>He beats everyone by submission</p>
<p>and wins for the first time the open weight,</p>
<p>a title he had never won before.</p>
<p>He steps off the mat, looks at me, he goes,</p>
<p>well, I got the first of them.</p>
<p>He won it, gi, open weight, and now ADCC.</p>
<p>And now he can barely move.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s still gone through two days of brutal competition,</p>
<p>and his ribs are completely screwed up.</p>
<p>Takes a week off to try and get his ribs</p>
<p>somewhere back in order,</p>
<p>and then begins light training, building up to ADCC.</p>
<p>We start putting him in no-gi competition.</p>
<p>He fights two opponents of good quality,</p>
<p>but not like world-beating quality.</p>
<p>And then as his game starts improving,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re getting closer and closer,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s starting to develop a sense</p>
<p>where he can wrestle confidently on his feet.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s no longer easy to leg lock at all,</p>
<p>and is starting to leg lock people,</p>
<p>and is starting to get his very strong guard passing,</p>
<p>which was based mostly around pant grips and the gi,</p>
<p>to adapt to leg no-gi grips.</p>
<p>In addition, he&rsquo;s starting to develop</p>
<p>strong chest-to-chest positioning,</p>
<p>which was never really part of his game,</p>
<p>a pressure top game.</p>
<p>And so things are looking good.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s matched against Rafael Lovato,</p>
<p>one of the great competitors of ADCC,</p>
<p>and wins a convincing victory,</p>
<p>featuring a lot of takedowns and a lot of pressure passing.</p>
<p>And people were just absolutely shocked.</p>
<p>I remember the staff of Flow Grappling</p>
<p>coming and going like, who is this guy?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s literally transformed, he&rsquo;s like a different person.</p>
<p>So he goes into the World Championships.</p>
<p>In his weight division,</p>
<p>he was matched with a fellow Brazilian in the first match,</p>
<p>and they had an absolute barn-burning battle</p>
<p>where at one point Nicklaus was picked up and slammed,</p>
<p>and then ended up winning by Kimura, beautiful Kimura.</p>
<p>Then he took on the man who ultimately wins</p>
<p>ADCC open weight division and defeats him.</p>
<p>And again, grueling matches.</p>
<p>Yeah, tough, tough match.</p>
<p>Now, Yuri Samoiya at that stage</p>
<p>was two-time gold medalist in ADCC.</p>
<p>Nicklaus wins a very, very close match against him,</p>
<p>and then fights Craig Jones,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s one of the best leg lockers in the world.</p>
<p>So I think most people were expecting Nicklaus</p>
<p>to get leg locked very easily by Craig.</p>
<p>Nicklaus showed the degree</p>
<p>to which he had improved his leg lock defense,</p>
<p>in a six-month period.</p>
<p>Craig never really got close to the legs,</p>
<p>and ended up becoming a takedown battle.</p>
<p>Could have gone either way.</p>
<p>Craig, I thought, did a really good job of pacing himself.</p>
<p>Both athletes were very tired,</p>
<p>but Nicklaus was ahead on points,</p>
<p>and then Craig hit one last takedown,</p>
<p>which sat Nicklaus down to a hip.</p>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t score, but it was the most aggressive takedown</p>
<p>of that last period.</p>
<p>And so Nicklaus got the nod and won a narrow victory.</p>
<p>Craig commented afterwards,</p>
<p>he said that, I really wanted the submission,</p>
<p>and he said, Nicklaus seemed to have</p>
<p>really wanted the submission,</p>
<p>but it ended up being a grueling match.</p>
<p>He took everything, exhaustion-wise, everything he had.</p>
<p>It was a tough, tough match,</p>
<p>and they were very well matched.</p>
<p>Once they figured out they couldn&rsquo;t submit each other,</p>
<p>it came down to their wrestling ability.</p>
<p>Neither one of them is a wrestling specialist,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re both competent in wrestling,</p>
<p>and it became physically very, very tough.</p>
<p>Then Nicklaus went on to win the bronze medal</p>
<p>in his weight division.</p>
<p>So the next day, when we get called for the open weight,</p>
<p>obviously Giancarlo had won a gold medal.</p>
<p>Everyone agreed that he should go into open weight.</p>
<p>And-</p>
<p>Did Giancarlo agree?</p>
<p>Of course, he was-</p>
<p>Because he didn&rsquo;t have an easy format.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t order people into it, you ask them.</p>
<p>No, no.</p>
<p>But he was delighted.</p>
<p>I guess the question I&rsquo;m asking is,</p>
<p>how do you find the strength to then go on to absolutely,</p>
<p>after, because you&rsquo;ve done a 14-week training camp</p>
<p>where every day was just as intense as any ADCC day,</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re used to it at that point.</p>
<p>But he had very, very long, tough matches.</p>
<p>But he&rsquo;s used to it.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a good athlete.</p>
<p>So Nicklaus and Giancarlo went out.</p>
<p>And Giancarlo had a spectacular submission victory</p>
<p>against his first opponent.</p>
<p>Nicklaus had some firework matches.</p>
<p>And one of the toughest opponents he came up against</p>
<p>was the brilliant Tai Ruatolo.</p>
<p>They had an absolute barn burner.</p>
<p>It was a very, very close match.</p>
<p>And Tai had an incredible first two matches.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;d beaten Pedro Mourinho by submission,</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;d beaten the great Felipe Pena</p>
<p>in a very narrow match.</p>
<p>Very, very tight.</p>
<p>Felipe lost on a guard pole.</p>
<p>But Felipe is considerably bigger and stronger than Tai.</p>
<p>So for Tai to win that match, even by a guard pole,</p>
<p>was deeply impressive.</p>
<p>It was an action-packed match that went back and forth.</p>
<p>Very, very impressive.</p>
<p>Can I ask you a small tangent?</p>
<p>Both the Ruatolo brothers had an incredible performance.</p>
<p>What do you think makes them so good,</p>
<p>if you were to analyze their game,</p>
<p>sort of outside of just this specific match?</p>
<p>Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a range of factors.</p>
<p>One is that they started the sport very, very young.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re probably the first example in American grappling</p>
<p>of American students who started at age four or five.</p>
<p>Most people, when I began jiu-jitsu,</p>
<p>started jiu-jitsu as adults.</p>
<p>I was 28 years old when I had my first lesson</p>
<p>as a white belt.</p>
<p>So in time, people got a little younger.</p>
<p>For example, Nicky Ryan started, I think, when he was 12.</p>
<p>But the Ruatolo started when they were literally children.</p>
<p>They had excellent coaching,</p>
<p>going all the way up through into their teenage years.</p>
<p>So they had the advantage of starting</p>
<p>the way so many successful athletes do, as children,</p>
<p>and going up through adulthood</p>
<p>and with strong coaching all along the way.</p>
<p>Excellent parental support.</p>
<p>So they had a great history where their youth</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t show off just how long they&rsquo;d been in the sport.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re dealing with a kid who&rsquo;s 19 years old,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s been grappling for 15 years.</p>
<p>And what counts is not your age, but your mat age.</p>
<p>Quality mat, yeah.</p>
<p>Now, they were very young in years,</p>
<p>but they were very old in mat age.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a lot of athletes that have now,</p>
<p>as you correctly said, have spent from a very early age</p>
<p>on the mat, but still these particular ones stand out.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, there&rsquo;s a lot more to it than that.</p>
<p>This is just the first set in the scene.</p>
<p>But what really makes them stand out</p>
<p>is that they&rsquo;ve mastered this idea of covering up</p>
<p>and improving initial weaknesses</p>
<p>while building upon strengths.</p>
<p>When the Rua Tolos first encountered my students,</p>
<p>they were relatively easy to leg lock</p>
<p>because none of their training experience</p>
<p>had prepared them for that.</p>
<p>Now, they were young at that time,</p>
<p>I believe like 16 or 17.</p>
<p>And it was an obvious problem for them.</p>
<p>They both got heel hooked by my youngsters also,</p>
<p>Nicky Ryan and Ethan Cralenston.</p>
<p>And you could clearly see that they identified</p>
<p>their current weakness and made prodigious steps</p>
<p>to improve upon it to a point now</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re winning championships</p>
<p>with their own leg locks.</p>
<p>I love the fact that even as teenagers,</p>
<p>they had the maturity to say,</p>
<p>okay, here&rsquo;s an obvious weakness.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s get around this.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s turn it into a strength.</p>
<p>I love the way they did that.</p>
<p>And focusing on the weakness and let that guide you</p>
<p>to the thing you&rsquo;re working on.</p>
<p>But they also, they covered up their weaknesses,</p>
<p>but they also understood what are our actual strengths.</p>
<p>Now, physically, both of the brothers</p>
<p>have extraordinary reach for their height.</p>
<p>They both have extraordinarily long arms for their height.</p>
<p>That means that variations of Karigatame,</p>
<p>in particular, dasas, anacondas are gonna be much easier</p>
<p>for them and their weight division than for most people.</p>
<p>These are all chokes.</p>
<p>Yes, strangleholds.</p>
<p>So they specialize in those.</p>
<p>They adapted a game based around movement,</p>
<p>which forces opponents, not with physical pressure,</p>
<p>but with tactical pressure into positions</p>
<p>which expose them to those specialized strangleholds</p>
<p>that they use.</p>
<p>Traditionally, when we looked at the Ryotaros</p>
<p>when they were young, we saw that there was a disparity</p>
<p>between their top game and their bottom game.</p>
<p>They were generally much better in top position</p>
<p>than they were in bottom position.</p>
<p>Again, they saw that as a potential weakness</p>
<p>and they turned it around using, again,</p>
<p>their unique long limbs relative to their height.</p>
<p>And they make use of a buggy strangle.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure why it&rsquo;s referred to as a buggy strangle,</p>
<p>but basically, it&rsquo;s a variation of Karigatame</p>
<p>using the legs done from disadvantageous positions</p>
<p>on bottom.</p>
<p>And they both make brilliant use of that,</p>
<p>not so much as a strangle weapon.</p>
<p>Occasionally, they&rsquo;ll strangle someone with it,</p>
<p>but they mostly use it to create pressure</p>
<p>to make people back off.</p>
<p>And as a result, they overcame the disparity</p>
<p>between their top game and their bottom game.</p>
<p>Now, their bottom game is part of their offense</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re very, very successful from there.</p>
<p>And so, again, you had that really impressive sense</p>
<p>in which they identified their weaknesses</p>
<p>in leg locks and bottom position,</p>
<p>turned it around and made it into strengths.</p>
<p>And at the same time, they identified,</p>
<p>okay, what are our physical gifts</p>
<p>and how can we maximize their use?</p>
<p>And they created a program of initiating movement</p>
<p>that created tactical rather than physical pressure</p>
<p>to set up their best strangleholds.</p>
<p>I deeply admire what they&rsquo;ve done.</p>
<p>Those two young men have a huge future ahead of them.</p>
<p>And so, here, one of the brothers faces</p>
<p>in the absolute, Nicholas Meragali.</p>
<p>Now, bear in mind, Tai has just fought</p>
<p>two very tough matches against guys</p>
<p>bigger and stronger than himself.</p>
<p>So, he&rsquo;s coming into a third match</p>
<p>against a third guy who&rsquo;s also bigger than he is.</p>
<p>So, hats off to Tai fighting open weight</p>
<p>against three monsters in a row.</p>
<p>Now, Tai and Cade, one of their best attributes</p>
<p>is they&rsquo;re two of the best scramblers</p>
<p>in the sport of jiu-jitsu.</p>
<p>So, whenever you go to shoot on the legs with them,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a danger of running straight</p>
<p>into a da stranglehold.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re very competent at counterattacking single legs</p>
<p>with da strangles.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also very hard to control them after a takedown.</p>
<p>They do a very good job of springing back up to the feet.</p>
<p>So, I told Nicholas to favor upper body judo-based takedowns</p>
<p>rather than wrestling takedowns.</p>
<p>And you see here a fine example</p>
<p>of Nicholas&rsquo;s gathering skill in uchimata,</p>
<p>one of the great throws of judo.</p>
<p>Set up with a, there&rsquo;s a bit of a foot sweep.</p>
<p>Like a-</p>
<p>Good.</p>
<p>The nice thing is he starts off with what it looks like.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually a two-directional uchimata.</p>
<p>He threatens uchigari to the back.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a throw that throws your opponent to the back.</p>
<p>His opponent pushes into him,</p>
<p>then he changes direction with a support foot</p>
<p>and takes him over with uchimata.</p>
<p>As we said earlier, the great advantage of judo</p>
<p>over wrestling is that because there&rsquo;s upper body connection</p>
<p>during the throw and after the throw,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s much harder for an opponent to scramble away from you.</p>
<p>And even Tai Ryutaro is one of the best scramblers</p>
<p>in the sport, has to stop scrambling here</p>
<p>and just go back to guard position</p>
<p>and enable Nicholas to hold top position.</p>
<p>I mean, some of it is also the surprise.</p>
<p>There is something less understandable</p>
<p>about judo techniques because there&rsquo;s less data,</p>
<p>it feels like.</p>
<p>The Ruth holders also have a good uchimata.</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;re very familiar with it.</p>
<p>How often do you think are they</p>
<p>on the receiving end of an uchimata?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good point, yeah.</p>
<p>So I just feel like they have more data</p>
<p>in terms of defending.</p>
<p>I mean, of course, there is fundamentals to the uchimata</p>
<p>that make it difficult to scramble around, but.</p>
<p>This is a good example of someone</p>
<p>who literally didn&rsquo;t have a single takedown six months ago.</p>
<p>Now he&rsquo;s throwing one of the toughest guys in the sport</p>
<p>with one of the more difficult throws of judo.</p>
<p>Now, you&rsquo;re a judo man.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll back me up on this.</p>
<p>Uchimata&rsquo;s not an easy throw to learn.</p>
<p>It takes some time.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re hopping on one foot with both of your body weight</p>
<p>supported on one foot.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very counterintuitive.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s a lot of work.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of the more difficult throws.</p>
<p>Let go of your understanding of takedowns,</p>
<p>of maybe wrestling-style takedowns,</p>
<p>or more intuitive kind of takedowns to understand it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s many throws like this.</p>
<p>Uchigari is like this.</p>
<p>Sotogari is like this.</p>
<p>Uchimata is like this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s weird.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m on one foot.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m hopping around.</p>
<p>This makes no sense.</p>
<p>But it works.</p>
<p>Foot sweeps are also weird in that way.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re a little bit more intuitive,</p>
<p>but to get very good at foot sweeps,</p>
<p>you have to understand timing, weight distribution.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a dynamic thing that&rsquo;s weird.</p>
<p>I always laugh when I talk to Nicholas.</p>
<p>I say, you know, I try to teach him a single leg,</p>
<p>which is traditionally most,</p>
<p>you know, like a high single leg</p>
<p>is one of the easier takedowns to perform</p>
<p>in terms of mechanical difficulty.</p>
<p>And Nicholas always struggles with it.</p>
<p>And then I teach him one of the more difficult takedowns,</p>
<p>Uchimata, and he does it flawlessly.</p>
<p>He never knows.</p>
<p>Certain things get attached.</p>
<p>I mean, you see this in Judo.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of interesting to see</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s classes of takedowns</p>
<p>and certain people just gravitate</p>
<p>in their philosophical, intuitive understanding</p>
<p>of body mechanics or something like this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like Seinagi versus Uchimata.</p>
<p>You very clearly see there&rsquo;s some people that understand,</p>
<p>they like to have both their feet planted on the ground.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s some people that are okay</p>
<p>with this one foot on the ground</p>
<p>and the other one is doing something else.</p>
<p>And I think that, I don&rsquo;t know what that,</p>
<p>what is that?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s what makes you fall in love</p>
<p>with one field versus another.</p>
<p>So what, can you speak to that,</p>
<p>that, you know, you&rsquo;ve released a new instructional</p>
<p>on takedowns and standing skills for Jiu-Jitsu,</p>
<p>just at a high level,</p>
<p>using Nicholas as an example,</p>
<p>what are some key ideas about takedowns?</p>
<p>Okay, first, whenever people talk</p>
<p>about standing position in Jiu-Jitsu,</p>
<p>they always say, oh, I need to learn some takedowns.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s never a question of just learning the takedowns,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s learning the prerequisites to the takedowns.</p>
<p>The takedowns are more or less like an afterthought.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got to begin with stance,</p>
<p>motion, the ability to engage in grip and contact,</p>
<p>get your opponent out of balance,</p>
<p>and then comes the takedowns.</p>
<p>The takedowns in Jiu-Jitsu are mostly divided</p>
<p>into a lower body takedowns,</p>
<p>tackles to the legs, single legs, double legs,</p>
<p>to a lesser degree, high crotch in Jiu-Jitsu,</p>
<p>and then upper body takedowns,</p>
<p>which are mostly Judo-derived.</p>
<p>Nicholas had to start more or less at the ground.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t even know how to come out</p>
<p>and make grips or hold a stance.</p>
<p>So he had to learn every element of it.</p>
<p>And the fact he was able to do so in six months</p>
<p>is just incredible.</p>
<p>Can you comment on the upward posture</p>
<p>that seems to work for Jiu-Jitsu?</p>
<p>The matches in Jiu-Jitsu are much longer</p>
<p>than the matches in wrestling.</p>
<p>In addition, there are many kinds of submission threat,</p>
<p>which are not there in wrestling.</p>
<p>So the stance has to be significantly changed.</p>
<p>In wrestling, they favor generally a very low crouch</p>
<p>because the vast majority of attacks are tackles</p>
<p>to the legs.</p>
<p>So anyone who stands upright in wrestling</p>
<p>tends to get heavily punished</p>
<p>by being taken down immediately with a leg tackle.</p>
<p>In Jiu-Jitsu, the matches are so much longer,</p>
<p>it would be difficult in a 40-minute match, for example,</p>
<p>to maintain a bent over crouch.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d be exhausted.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also problems associated with submission holds.</p>
<p>There are many forms of submission hold,</p>
<p>guillotines, dice, et cetera,</p>
<p>where if your head comes down too low,</p>
<p>you become a little vulnerable to this.</p>
<p>And so the stances in Jiu-Jitsu competition</p>
<p>tend to be much more upright, more like Judo and Greco.</p>
<p>So right off the bat, you see the stance is different.</p>
<p>The motion tends to be much slower and more evenly paced</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;ve got to be able to do this</p>
<p>for long periods of time.</p>
<p>So the number of fakes per minute,</p>
<p>the number of shots attempted per minute</p>
<p>is usually much lower.</p>
<p>So these are obvious differences.</p>
<p>The biggest difference, however,</p>
<p>has nothing to do with that.</p>
<p>It has to do with tactics.</p>
<p>In Jiu-Jitsu, the scores</p>
<p>will be judged by what happens after the takedown.</p>
<p>In the case of ADCC, you can take someone down</p>
<p>in ways that would score in both wrestling and Judo,</p>
<p>and possibly even win the match in the case of Judo,</p>
<p>and it would score zero in ADCC</p>
<p>because of the nature of the rules.</p>
<p>The whole idea of ADCC scoring</p>
<p>is to demonstrate control after the takedown.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s what happens in the critical three seconds</p>
<p>after the takedown that creates the score.</p>
<p>In Judo and in wrestling,</p>
<p>the emphasis is placed on the takedown itself.</p>
<p>In Jiu-Jitsu, the emphasis is placed on the aftermath</p>
<p>of the takedown.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where the score is allocated.</p>
<p>And that can be a period of up to three seconds.</p>
<p>Now, three seconds doesn&rsquo;t sound like much,</p>
<p>but in a scramble after a takedown,</p>
<p>three seconds is a fucking eternity.</p>
<p>It goes on forever.</p>
<p>And so you will see many examples of takedowns</p>
<p>that, as I said, would score very well</p>
<p>in Judo and wrestling, but don&rsquo;t score at all in ADCC.</p>
<p>And so the whole skill becomes packaging</p>
<p>the standing position in terms of the takedowns themselves,</p>
<p>but in particular, preparing the athletes</p>
<p>for that critical three seconds after the takedown.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why many people who are very fine wrestlers</p>
<p>struggle in ADCC.</p>
<p>They take people down by wrestling metric all the time,</p>
<p>but don&rsquo;t score under ADCC rules.</p>
<p>What makes GSB so good at takedowns?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve gotten a chance to even recently watch him</p>
<p>do takedowns.</p>
<p>Is it within this framework that you&rsquo;re teaching,</p>
<p>what stands out to you about him</p>
<p>that you draw lessons from?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s another example of someone who&rsquo;s performing takedowns</p>
<p>in a rule set radically different from wrestling.</p>
<p>Just as the ADCC rule set is so different</p>
<p>from conventional wrestling rule sets</p>
<p>that the whole manner in which you approach takedowns</p>
<p>and even your understanding of takedowns</p>
<p>has to be quite strongly modified.</p>
<p>So to an MMA, it&rsquo;s even more extreme.</p>
<p>People always think, oh, this guy&rsquo;s a good wrestler.</p>
<p>He should be able to get takedowns in MMA easily.</p>
<p>What you find is that the wrestling skills in MMA</p>
<p>enable you to finish takedowns.</p>
<p>If you get in on your opponent and get to the legs</p>
<p>or the waist or what have you,</p>
<p>your wrestling skill will enable you</p>
<p>to finish the takedown.</p>
<p>But getting to the takedown is massively different</p>
<p>in the context of MMA than it is in wrestling.</p>
<p>The entire stance is different.</p>
<p>The entire set of distancing is different.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the idea of positioning within a cage,</p>
<p>like how close you are to the perimeter of the cage</p>
<p>changes radically how you approach the takedown.</p>
<p>The setups are literally night and day different.</p>
<p>The setups are almost entirely composed of striking setups</p>
<p>rather than grappling setups.</p>
<p>And so the act of getting to the takedown</p>
<p>is like a completely different sport.</p>
<p>Now, George studied wrestling</p>
<p>and used to go to wrestling practice twice a week.</p>
<p>In Canada, they do freestyle wrestling.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t use the American college style of wrestling.</p>
<p>Now, George&rsquo;s main emphasis in wrestling training</p>
<p>was takedowns.</p>
<p>Obviously, the whole ground element of freestyle wrestling</p>
<p>was of no interest to him,</p>
<p>like learning how to put people&rsquo;s back on the ground</p>
<p>and turn them with leg laces and gut wrenches</p>
<p>was of no value in MMA.</p>
<p>So he devoted almost all of his study</p>
<p>to just the act of taking someone down.</p>
<p>So in pure wrestling, George is not bad.</p>
<p>I think he would be a very competitive match</p>
<p>even for a highly ranked American freestyle wrestler.</p>
<p>Obviously, he would lose easily on the ground</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s not used to the part here.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;d probably be leg laced or gut wrenched quite easily</p>
<p>by a skilled opponent.</p>
<p>But in just a pure takedown battle,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;d be a competitive training partner</p>
<p>for even a good wrestler.</p>
<p>But in actual MMA competition,</p>
<p>he could take down even the most highly credentialed</p>
<p>wrestlers and in some cases,</p>
<p>make it look almost effortless.</p>
<p>And that came from his unification of striking skill</p>
<p>with wrestling.</p>
<p>So he used wrestling skills to finish the takedown</p>
<p>and his karate and kickboxing pedigree</p>
<p>to enter into the takedown.</p>
<p>Now, when he initiated the study of this,</p>
<p>this was at a time when MMA was pretty much in its infancy.</p>
<p>And he was one of the most impressive people</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve ever seen in this regard.</p>
<p>He was a true innovator.</p>
<p>He innovated this specialized area of striking</p>
<p>to a takedown to a greater degree</p>
<p>than anyone else I&rsquo;m aware of.</p>
<p>Well, let me ask you about this innovation</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re one of the most innovative people</p>
<p>in martial arts.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s several major categories of innovation</p>
<p>that you have led.</p>
<p>Obviously, leg locks, body lock, now wrestling.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your process of innovation?</p>
<p>So seeing the problems in a particular system,</p>
<p>the gaps, how do you identify them?</p>
<p>And how do you figure out systems</p>
<p>of how to fill those gaps?</p>
<p>First thing I look for is what are the current weaknesses</p>
<p>in a given combat sport?</p>
<p>So in the case of jiu-jitsu,</p>
<p>it was very obvious that historically,</p>
<p>jiu-jitsu had always been weak in leg locking.</p>
<p>Jiu-jitsu had always been weak in standing position,</p>
<p>overall, and these were things</p>
<p>that needed to be sorted out immediately.</p>
<p>In its infancy, mixed martial arts was divided</p>
<p>between grapplers and strikers.</p>
<p>And most of the emphasis in early mixed martial arts</p>
<p>was on the idea of specialists in a given domain</p>
<p>forcing the fight into their domain.</p>
<p>And that my early work with Georges St-Pierre</p>
<p>convinced me that the right approach</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t increased specialization and learning</p>
<p>to force your athlete into that area of specialization</p>
<p>at the expense of the opponent,</p>
<p>but rather the real battles of the future</p>
<p>would be won and lost not with techniques per se,</p>
<p>specialized techniques, but rather the integration</p>
<p>of techniques and the overlap</p>
<p>between the various grappling and striking skills.</p>
<p>So that someone who was an inferior grappler</p>
<p>would have just enough grappling skills</p>
<p>to be able to hold a grappler off</p>
<p>and then defeat them with striking.</p>
<p>And a striker who was, if you went to fight someone</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s superior to you in striking,</p>
<p>you would have just enough striking skill</p>
<p>to be able to hold them at bay</p>
<p>and then enter into grappling.</p>
<p>This went further and further until it got clear</p>
<p>that there were whole areas of the sport</p>
<p>that you need to change your entire mindset about them.</p>
<p>So that people went into early MMA</p>
<p>thinking in terms of grappler and striker.</p>
<p>What I started to think is in terms of,</p>
<p>okay, there are four fundamental skill areas</p>
<p>of mixed martial arts.</p>
<p>There is shoot boxing, which is the integration</p>
<p>of takedowns and striking.</p>
<p>There is clinch boxing,</p>
<p>which is the integration of upper body clinch skills</p>
<p>combined with striking.</p>
<p>There is fence boxing,</p>
<p>which the two athletes are locked up</p>
<p>with each other on the fence</p>
<p>and they have to integrate takedown,</p>
<p>takedown defense and striking skills.</p>
<p>And there is grapple boxing,</p>
<p>which is the merging of ground grappling with striking.</p>
<p>And when you broke MMA down into those four categories,</p>
<p>you saw that each one of those four domains</p>
<p>transcends the specialized martial arts</p>
<p>that form their components.</p>
<p>So for example, in clinch boxing,</p>
<p>you would incorporate things from judo,</p>
<p>Greco-Roman, freestyle, jiu-jitsu submissions,</p>
<p>Muay Thai, clinching techniques.</p>
<p>But even if you took all five of those,</p>
<p>the rule set that you&rsquo;re operating in</p>
<p>required such extensive modification</p>
<p>that the final product of clinch boxing</p>
<p>transcended all five of its component martial arts</p>
<p>and became its own autonomous skill.</p>
<p>It needed to be worked autonomously.</p>
<p>And when we broke George&rsquo;s training</p>
<p>down into those four areas,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when real progress started to be made.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when you started to see</p>
<p>the integration of those four phases</p>
<p>and the striking and grappling within each of them</p>
<p>was where victory was being won and lost.</p>
<p>So once you reframe how you see a particular combat sport,</p>
<p>then you could start doing these</p>
<p>detailed development of ideas</p>
<p>that actually they fit.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a sense in which it had to start</p>
<p>with a paradigm shift</p>
<p>and then a research program began after that.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t start with research,</p>
<p>you started with a paradigm shift</p>
<p>and then went to research.</p>
<p>Well, let me ask you,</p>
<p>I got a chance to hang out with you and Henzo Gracie at ADCC.</p>
<p>He keeps messaging me saying he&rsquo;s gonna call me</p>
<p>and not calling me.</p>
<p>I think aside from being hilarious,</p>
<p>charismatic and handsome,</p>
<p>he is also, and wise for his young age.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s also one of the greatest coaches</p>
<p>and athletes of all time in martial arts.</p>
<p>So let me ask,</p>
<p>what have you learned about life from Henzo Gracie?</p>
<p>The degree of difficulty that Henzo must have encountered,</p>
<p>he never talked to us about it,</p>
<p>but I figured this out as the years went by.</p>
<p>The degree of difficulty that he must have experienced</p>
<p>when he first came to Manhattan and started teaching,</p>
<p>it must have just been incredible.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got to remember,</p>
<p>Henzo came from Brazil,</p>
<p>training with the best people in the world at that time,</p>
<p>you know, Hickson,</p>
<p>all the machados,</p>
<p>all of them were located around Gracie Baja</p>
<p>and that Rio de Janeiro,</p>
<p>they all knew each other and they all trained together.</p>
<p>They had internal problems, of course,</p>
<p>but they all knew each other well</p>
<p>and knew each other&rsquo;s games.</p>
<p>So all of them had beautiful and highly developed jiu-jitsu.</p>
<p>So all Henzo knew from childhood on</p>
<p>was perfect, beautiful jiu-jitsu</p>
<p>and communicating with other people</p>
<p>who also knew perfect, beautiful jiu-jitsu.</p>
<p>Then he comes to New York,</p>
<p>where he has to teach in a language</p>
<p>that he at that stage barely spoke</p>
<p>to a bunch of fucking morons</p>
<p>who didn&rsquo;t even,</p>
<p>on my first day in jiu-jitsu,</p>
<p>they had to explain to me the difference</p>
<p>between the mount and the guard</p>
<p>because as far as I was concerned,</p>
<p>yeah, you&rsquo;re on top, it&rsquo;s the same thing.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re like, no, no, no,</p>
<p>mounted is different from guard.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m like, no, it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>Like, you&rsquo;re on top of the guy.</p>
<p>You just hit him.</p>
<p>So he has to argue with you about this.</p>
<p>And imagine going from training with Hicks and Gracie</p>
<p>to having to tell some moron</p>
<p>that guard is different from mount.</p>
<p>And we were so primitive back then.</p>
<p>He went from the best training culture in the world</p>
<p>to literally the worst.</p>
<p>Just a bunch of guys in their mid-20s</p>
<p>who knew nothing about the ground,</p>
<p>just complete white mouth.</p>
<p>Luckily, he&rsquo;s known for his patience.</p>
<p>Out of that, he molded one of the greatest gyms ever</p>
<p>in New York.</p>
<p>Yes, he did a fantastic job.</p>
<p>And most of it was based around the idea</p>
<p>that he gave us complete freedom.</p>
<p>We came in, we trained all day,</p>
<p>and I started teaching beginners classes.</p>
<p>And then some of his senior students,</p>
<p>Ricardo Almeida, Rodrigo Gracie, and Matt Serra,</p>
<p>opened their own schools around the tri-state area.</p>
<p>So they left.</p>
<p>There was a vacuum of teachers,</p>
<p>and he asked me to start teaching.</p>
<p>I taught for many, many years there.</p>
<p>And he always gave us complete freedom.</p>
<p>His only thing was to say, okay, do whatever you want,</p>
<p>just make sure it&rsquo;s effective.</p>
<p>Prove to me it&rsquo;s effective.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the best research program you can ever have.</p>
<p>Show me proof.</p>
<p>And so many times, especially in those days in jiu-jitsu,</p>
<p>there were so many things that were just off limits.</p>
<p>You couldn&rsquo;t study Legos.</p>
<p>You couldn&rsquo;t do this, you couldn&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<p>This kind of game was for cowards.</p>
<p>This is the only kind of game we accept.</p>
<p>And Hinzo was never like that.</p>
<p>He was just like, okay, just do what you want.</p>
<p>Prove to me it works.</p>
<p>And if you give people that simple structure,</p>
<p>you give them some time, some ingenuity,</p>
<p>a lot of things can happen.</p>
<p>I gotta ask you, and by the way,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;ll come on this podcast,</p>
<p>and I do feel like it&rsquo;s a little bit like</p>
<p>riding a dragon or a bull of some kind.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll be a fun journey.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t, at least from my perspective,</p>
<p>having interacted with him, having met him,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard not to smile from his stories.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s easily one of the most charismatic people in jiu-jitsu.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of fun to watch that humans can be like this too.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just the love that radiates from him is incredible.</p>
<p>I gotta ask you, this is from Reddit.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a few legends that come from that gym,</p>
<p>but people on Reddit kept asking</p>
<p>about some guy named Boris.</p>
<p>Apparently you coached him at Hinzo&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>and he was a legend, and he was terrifyingly good.</p>
<p>What made him a legend?</p>
<p>Who is this Boris character?</p>
<p>Boris is one of my early students.</p>
<p>I think he was either my first or second black belt.</p>
<p>Boris came from Long Island.</p>
<p>He was a wrestler.</p>
<p>He was of Russian Jewish descent,</p>
<p>and highly intelligent.</p>
<p>And now he was short of stature,</p>
<p>but very powerfully built and compact.</p>
<p>Very nice, polite young man,</p>
<p>but also slightly eccentric,</p>
<p>which I always liked about him.</p>
<p>He would always come dressed with glasses on,</p>
<p>and he would leave the gym dressed like,</p>
<p>to use the American phrase, a complete nerd,</p>
<p>with his pocket protector.</p>
<p>Now, he was heavily muscled,</p>
<p>but he would dress in such a way</p>
<p>that it didn&rsquo;t appear so when he left.</p>
<p>And we always used to laugh.</p>
<p>Imagine if some guy tried to mug Boris.</p>
<p>They would see him with his nerdy glasses on</p>
<p>and his pocket protector,</p>
<p>and they would literally run into</p>
<p>one of the most formidable human beings</p>
<p>in the entire New York area.</p>
<p>Boris started training jujitsu, I believe, in Long Island,</p>
<p>and then when he got a tech job in Manhattan,</p>
<p>started training with us in a morning class.</p>
<p>Now, these were relatively early days in Manhattan</p>
<p>and in my teaching career.</p>
<p>And he and a group of others, a very small group,</p>
<p>we used to train early in the morning,</p>
<p>around 6 a.m. before work.</p>
<p>And Boris was a legend in those days.</p>
<p>Now, a very young George St. Pierre</p>
<p>came to train with us at that time,</p>
<p>and he would come in at 6 a.m. to do his morning class.</p>
<p>And he was one of the main training partners for Boris.</p>
<p>And Boris, being a wrestler,</p>
<p>used to generally prefer top position.</p>
<p>And I would always encourage George</p>
<p>to play bottom position.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say, you gotta get good in bottom position.</p>
<p>You never know.</p>
<p>I know you&rsquo;re good at takedowns,</p>
<p>but one day someone&rsquo;s gonna put you down,</p>
<p>so you gotta work bottom position.</p>
<p>And Boris had very strong guard passing.</p>
<p>I remember one of George&rsquo;s happiest days</p>
<p>is finally, after like two years,</p>
<p>one day he swept Boris, got on top and finished him.</p>
<p>And I remember that was one of his biggest thrills</p>
<p>in all of his training career.</p>
<p>That was the last time that ever happened for him.</p>
<p>No, Boris was, he was a very formidable man for that time.</p>
<p>The funny thing about Boris is,</p>
<p>every time we would have a conversation,</p>
<p>he would say, I&rsquo;m only gonna do this sport</p>
<p>until I&rsquo;m 40 years old, and then I&rsquo;m gonna stop.</p>
<p>And I was like, why?</p>
<p>Why not be like a lifelong martial artist?</p>
<p>You know, you got so good.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re good at jiu-jitsu.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got great skills.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve worked hard.</p>
<p>Why not just keep going?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s ridiculous for a man to train after 40.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no need.</p>
<p>He never gave any reason for this.</p>
<p>It was just ridiculous.</p>
<p>So one day, now this is a guy who came in</p>
<p>literally every day, 6 a.m., every day.</p>
<p>One day, he comes in, he comes up to me at the end of training</p>
<p>and goes, hey, John, I just turned 40,</p>
<p>so I won&rsquo;t be seeing you again.</p>
<p>And I thought, he&rsquo;s joking.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m like, I&rsquo;ll see you tomorrow, Boris.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, no, you won&rsquo;t, and walks off.</p>
<p>How gangster is that?</p>
<p>And then he never came back.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never seen Boris since.</p>
<p>He came in, was one of the best grapplers I ever saw,</p>
<p>and just, that&rsquo;s it, buddy, I&rsquo;m out.</p>
<p>And to this day.</p>
<p>No one to walk away.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>I also got to hang out, got to meet,</p>
<p>hang out with Ali Abdelaziz.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a Henzo Gracie black belt,</p>
<p>fourth degree judo black belt,</p>
<p>and friend and manager of Khabib Nurmagomedov,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s coming down to Austin soon.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll do a podcast.</p>
<p>Hopefully, we&rsquo;ll get on the mat</p>
<p>and have a bit of brainstorm.</p>
<p>Also, he&rsquo;s a manager and friend</p>
<p>of many other amazing fighters.</p>
<p>I really love the guy.</p>
<p>The loyalty, the fact that he looks for loyalty</p>
<p>and has that inner, close inner circle,</p>
<p>and integrity and character in people,</p>
<p>I really like them.</p>
<p>I connect to them really quickly.</p>
<p>But any fun stories about Ali?</p>
<p>Did you train together?</p>
<p>Yes, he trained for many years in the basement, in my classes.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s, his story is one of the most unlikely stories.</p>
<p>Like, if someone wrote a movie plot about his life,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;d be like, it&rsquo;s absurd.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d be thrown out the door in a second.</p>
<p>And yet, it all happened.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re absolutely correct.</p>
<p>He has, from the unlikeliest possible starts,</p>
<p>created a situation where he&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s incontestable now to say</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s the most successful manager</p>
<p>in mixed martial arts history.</p>
<p>He has more champions under his care</p>
<p>than anyone else I&rsquo;m aware of.</p>
<p>And respected and influential, so on all dimensions, yes.</p>
<p>Now, many people aren&rsquo;t aware of the fact</p>
<p>that he was actually a very good Judo player.</p>
<p>He had-</p>
<p>Jidoka first, yeah.</p>
<p>Yes, yeah, he had very good Nogi Judo.</p>
<p>He had an excellent Haraigoshi, very good Tani Itoshi.</p>
<p>And he, through many people</p>
<p>who were highly credentialed wrestlers</p>
<p>and back in the basement,</p>
<p>back in the glory days of MMA training,</p>
<p>he was a good example of a guy</p>
<p>who had very, very good Judo hips</p>
<p>and often used it to counter wrestling</p>
<p>and was a fine demonstrator of the idea that</p>
<p>when Judo is adapted to Nogi gripping,</p>
<p>it can provide a very effective foil</p>
<p>to many of the standard forms of wrestling attack.</p>
<p>And he would often use Uchimata to counter leg tackles</p>
<p>and do so in very, very spectacular fashion.</p>
<p>Well, what do you think about Khabib?</p>
<p>Is there something from just watching him</p>
<p>or is there something you can imagine</p>
<p>if he comes down to the gym</p>
<p>that you might learn from the way he moves,</p>
<p>the way he approaches wrestling?</p>
<p>Oh, absolutely.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s one of the greatest combat athletes of all time.</p>
<p>If you can&rsquo;t learn from someone like that,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something wrong with you.</p>
<p>So he emphasizes control.</p>
<p>Yes, he does.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s absolutely a master of exerting control.</p>
<p>The amount of grappling control he was able to put over</p>
<p>some of the most difficult people in the world to control</p>
<p>was truly astounding.</p>
<p>He beat people from every style.</p>
<p>He beat wrestlers, he beat Jiu-Jitsu players,</p>
<p>he beat kickboxers,</p>
<p>and he controlled them all in more or less the same way.</p>
<p>He has a very underrated bottom game.</p>
<p>People think, oh, he&rsquo;s just about stifling top control,</p>
<p>but people forget he was taken down on several occasions</p>
<p>and ended up in bottom position.</p>
<p>And he showed excellent guard work from bottom.</p>
<p>He was able to get into submission holds readily</p>
<p>on opponents from bottom position.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s got an excellent bottom game.</p>
<p>People say, oh, he&rsquo;s just a positional guy.</p>
<p>No, he&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s got great submissions.</p>
<p>The application of his triangle</p>
<p>from both top and bottom was top class.</p>
<p>He had a sharp arm lock from bottom position.</p>
<p>Excellent Kimura.</p>
<p>If you look at his Kimura finishes in MMA,</p>
<p>they were technically very, very well set.</p>
<p>Excellent breaking mechanics.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a very, very fine grappler</p>
<p>in both submission grappling and MMA grappling.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;d probably learn a ton</p>
<p>from moving around with him.</p>
<p>Is it possible to learn something about him</p>
<p>or about Hodger Gracie or about Gordon</p>
<p>by watching them or rolling around them for a little bit?</p>
<p>So maybe Hodger and Khabib are good examples</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re able to do seemingly very basic things</p>
<p>on everybody and dominate them with that.</p>
<p>I think Gordon is as well,</p>
<p>but Gordon seems to have more preference</p>
<p>and range of what he&rsquo;s able to do.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost miraculous how much Hodger can do</p>
<p>by just the same exact thing on everybody.</p>
<p>Is it possible to understand why Hodger or Khabib</p>
<p>are so good at very basic positions?</p>
<p>Or do you have to feel it?</p>
<p>Or is it just something that&rsquo;s developed over years?</p>
<p>I think for most people, for the vast majority of people,</p>
<p>it would have to be explained to them.</p>
<p>For a smaller group of people, if they felt it,</p>
<p>they could try to replicate it.</p>
<p>And there are a few people who could look at it</p>
<p>and have enough knowledge and say,</p>
<p>okay, I can see what he&rsquo;s doing.</p>
<p>Like for example, Hodger could probably look</p>
<p>at video footage of Khabib grappling and say,</p>
<p>okay, I understand what he&rsquo;s doing.</p>
<p>But the average person would probably go over their heads.</p>
<p>You sometimes think of like these great athletes,</p>
<p>like maybe they&rsquo;re too narrow.</p>
<p>Like you might imagine they&rsquo;re kind of so focused</p>
<p>on a particular thing,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t develop in interesting ways.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s just a sweetheart.</p>
<p>Yeah, he&rsquo;s a wonderful person to be around.</p>
<p>Yeah, he&rsquo;s also visiting Austin.</p>
<p>But just I was so, I mean, first of all,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m honored just drinking a little bit too much</p>
<p>in Vegas with Hodger Gracie and just,</p>
<p>and talking about love and relationships</p>
<p>and life and death and all those philosophical topics</p>
<p>as one does in Vegas.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a little bit too much to drink.</p>
<p>Anyway, after ADCC, it was beautiful.</p>
<p>And on top of that, hanging out with Rogan many days</p>
<p>for UFC and then ADCC.</p>
<p>You know, one thing,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ve gotten a chance to hang out</p>
<p>with Joe when he plays pool.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So I spent a lot of time with him when he was playing pool,</p>
<p>like recently on that trip to Vegas.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s something Zen-like about,</p>
<p>first of all, just watching him,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve never seen the focus the guys got on the game</p>
<p>for hours, just deep focus, unshakable focus.</p>
<p>That was so interesting to watch</p>
<p>that this human being, he&rsquo;s a celebrity,</p>
<p>he does all kinds of stuff,</p>
<p>that he&rsquo;s able to allocate as close to 100% of his mind</p>
<p>as I can imagine to a particular task</p>
<p>and nothing can distract him.</p>
<p>That was really inspiring that you could still do that</p>
<p>on any task.</p>
<p>You know, pool is a game of physics.</p>
<p>That should be your domain.</p>
<p>Oh, it is.</p>
<p>But that wasn&rsquo;t just physics.</p>
<p>Yeah, I would think you understand the game,</p>
<p>you understand the physics of it.</p>
<p>You also understand the fun of it</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s friends and laughter and so on.</p>
<p>I would be distracted by that a little bit.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t be as focused.</p>
<p>He literally, the closer you get to the table,</p>
<p>the more everything zooms in.</p>
<p>The jokes, there&rsquo;s funny things,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t get his attention on anything.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that focus.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, that really stayed with me.</p>
<p>That, you know, those memes,</p>
<p>like I wanna find somebody that looks at me</p>
<p>the way X looks at Y.</p>
<p>I wanna find somebody that looks at me</p>
<p>the way Joe looks at a pool cue or whatever.</p>
<p>The focus there.</p>
<p>I wanna find something in my life.</p>
<p>Rather, I want to attain the level of focus he has</p>
<p>for pool on a task that I care about.</p>
<p>And that focus, like fuck everything else.</p>
<p>This is, now it&rsquo;s time to do work.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, that was really inspiring.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t seen that kind of focus</p>
<p>for prolonged periods of time on a task.</p>
<p>You should see it sometime.</p>
<p>The guy is, I mean,</p>
<p>part of it is just being competitive with himself.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the hatred of imperfection,</p>
<p>all those kinds of elements,</p>
<p>but embodied in a singular focus.</p>
<p>I had no idea he even played pool.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>You should watch him.</p>
<p>He won&rsquo;t, I think it could be</p>
<p>one of his greatest obsessions.</p>
<p>Like there was deep,</p>
<p>see, I thought pool is for like degenerates,</p>
<p>like gamblers and like hustlers, right?</p>
<p>Like the same way I see poker,</p>
<p>but like I saw like a wolf slash like elite athlete in Joe.</p>
<p>I said, I didn&rsquo;t know this.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know much about pool.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know that you could have that level of focus</p>
<p>while still drunk at your ass,</p>
<p>but extremely focused.</p>
<p>It was beautiful to see.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, inspiring for me</p>
<p>as a person who highly values singular focus on a task.</p>
<p>Let me ask you from a perspective of a hobbyist,</p>
<p>what major practical changes can a hobbyist</p>
<p>who works regular nine to five job</p>
<p>do to improve their jiu-jitsu?</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re in a gym.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of excellent gyms</p>
<p>throughout the United States.</p>
<p>What can they do to improve their jiu-jitsu?</p>
<p>About the way they think about jiu-jitsu,</p>
<p>about the way they approach their actual schedule,</p>
<p>those kinds of things.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a great question.</p>
<p>Okay, the less training time you&rsquo;ve got,</p>
<p>the more you wanna maximize its effect.</p>
<p>So a question becomes, okay,</p>
<p>if I&rsquo;m training say twice a week,</p>
<p>and sometimes even once a week,</p>
<p>what can I do to make sure</p>
<p>that that two hour period is used maximally?</p>
<p>Um,</p>
<p>the less training time you&rsquo;ve got,</p>
<p>the more the onus is on you</p>
<p>to have a plan before you walk in the door.</p>
<p>If you go in just saying,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna roll around and see what happens,</p>
<p>or I&rsquo;ll just follow what the instructor says,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll get a certain amount out of each class,</p>
<p>but it will never be what it could have been.</p>
<p>Go in with a plan and enact it.</p>
<p>Many people go in with a plan and don&rsquo;t follow it.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say, for example,</p>
<p>we start with a program that goes like this.</p>
<p>First, try to create the most honest assessment</p>
<p>of yourself as a jiu-jitsu player.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s tough to make an honest assessment of yourself</p>
<p>because you never actually get to see your game.</p>
<p>So what I would recommend is to start</p>
<p>by videotaping yourself in sparring with your peers.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fascinating,</p>
<p>because we don&rsquo;t even have that level of introspection,</p>
<p>ability to reflect of what we actually look like</p>
<p>in grappling.</p>
<p>Start with an assessment of yourself,</p>
<p>and the most honest one comes not from you,</p>
<p>it comes from the camera.</p>
<p>Have a look at what you see and start to say,</p>
<p>okay, many of the weaknesses in your game</p>
<p>are made much more apparent by looking from the outside in</p>
<p>rather than feeling them during the heat of a match.</p>
<p>Identify four or five of the biggest weaknesses</p>
<p>that you see and start actively attacking those weaknesses.</p>
<p>Ask yourself, let&rsquo;s say, for example,</p>
<p>in the course of watching the videotape of yourself,</p>
<p>you observe yourself losing three triangles.</p>
<p>You attempted three triangle strangleholds,</p>
<p>you failed all three.</p>
<p>You could start by saying, okay, let me ask myself,</p>
<p>who are the people I look up to the most</p>
<p>with regards a triangle strangle?</p>
<p>Who are the guys who have the best triangle strangles</p>
<p>out there?</p>
<p>Then ask yourselves, of those people,</p>
<p>who are the ones whose body type and personality</p>
<p>most closely mirrors my own?</p>
<p>And that would be a good example</p>
<p>of taking a problem in your game,</p>
<p>contrasting it with elite level performance</p>
<p>in people whose body type roughly matches your own,</p>
<p>and then try to take lessons you learned</p>
<p>by observing the best people</p>
<p>and bringing them into your own game in one specific area.</p>
<p>As time goes by, you do this with more and more elements</p>
<p>of your game, you will undoubtedly improve.</p>
<p>You will also have to make sure that you take time</p>
<p>during class to actively work on these things.</p>
<p>Now, sometimes in class, you don&rsquo;t get a choice.</p>
<p>The instructor sometimes says, okay,</p>
<p>today we&rsquo;re working this, this, and this.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s always time after and before class</p>
<p>where you can do your own drilling,</p>
<p>where you can make your own inquiries.</p>
<p>And during sparring, there&rsquo;s no rigorous control</p>
<p>over what you do.</p>
<p>You can try to work the game into the area of focus.</p>
<p>So for example, if you want to work on front triangles,</p>
<p>it would be wise for you to do most of your sparring</p>
<p>from bottom guard positions.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;ll give you the most opportunity.</p>
<p>And in this sense, it always begins with</p>
<p>an accurate assessment of your current skill level.</p>
<p>You gotta start there.</p>
<p>Then, I always encourage people to use video camera</p>
<p>to make the most honest appraisal you can</p>
<p>because your own mind is not dishonest,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s understandably inaccurate.</p>
<p>You tend to feel things rather than see them</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re performing jiu-jitsu.</p>
<p>Then, make a program for yourself</p>
<p>based around what you see as excellence.</p>
<p>Look at the people in the sport who&rsquo;s in the area</p>
<p>that you wanna work on,</p>
<p>people who are renowned for skill in that area.</p>
<p>If possible, narrow it down to people</p>
<p>who have excellence in that area</p>
<p>and their body type corresponds with your own.</p>
<p>And then, try to take lessons learned</p>
<p>from observing the excellence in these elite athletes</p>
<p>and bring elements of them into your game.</p>
<p>Never try to bring an elite athlete&rsquo;s entire game</p>
<p>to your game.</p>
<p>That will create an inauthentic game on your part,</p>
<p>which will always be a poor copy</p>
<p>of what you&rsquo;re trying to watch.</p>
<p>Rather, bring very specific areas and skills that you see</p>
<p>and import them from different people</p>
<p>until eventually you find something for yourself.</p>
<p>Experiment a lot, okay?</p>
<p>Everyone&rsquo;s different.</p>
<p>And so, don&rsquo;t see the video research as the final word.</p>
<p>See video research the way a writer will see a muse.</p>
<p>As someone who initiates discussion,</p>
<p>opens inquiries for your own research.</p>
<p>The most powerful moments you will have on the mat</p>
<p>come from making discoveries for yourself.</p>
<p>Not being told what to do,</p>
<p>not observing someone else doing something,</p>
<p>but self-discoveries.</p>
<p>Those are the ones that will last inside you.</p>
<p>So, use video research</p>
<p>not as the definitive answer to your problems,</p>
<p>but as initiating research for yourself on the mat.</p>
<p>And as time goes by and you do this more and more often</p>
<p>in more and more areas of the sport,</p>
<p>I promise you, you&rsquo;ll improve.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I guess when you have the plan,</p>
<p>have a plan that carries across many training sessions.</p>
<p>So, I just remember, I know this is perhaps dumb,</p>
<p>but I saw in my own game early on a lot of growth</p>
<p>is by self-identifying a problem</p>
<p>and coming up by myself with a solution</p>
<p>by watching, in that case, Marcel Garcia.</p>
<p>I just thought my butterfly guard was very weak.</p>
<p>And so, I thought, okay, what&rsquo;s the solution here?</p>
<p>I thought maybe this X guard thing, double X guard.</p>
<p>Okay, so I watched a bunch of video.</p>
<p>Let me try to work on this.</p>
<p>And then all I did, just this is self,</p>
<p>but when I could get time by myself,</p>
<p>meaning like not instructor-guided classes,</p>
<p>but in training, I would just,</p>
<p>everything I would put myself into butterfly and X guard.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>And then just let go.</p>
<p>Like, don&rsquo;t progress.</p>
<p>Sweep and figure out a way to get swept</p>
<p>to get right back to it and everything.</p>
<p>It was annoying probably to train with me</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s all I did and that&rsquo;s all I thought about.</p>
<p>I bet you learned quickly.</p>
<p>Yeah, I learned it&rsquo;s the most progress I&rsquo;ve ever made.</p>
<p>Now, you could say that X guard</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t the right solution for me,</p>
<p>that maybe that wasn&rsquo;t the weakest point for me to work on.</p>
<p>If I were to look back now, it&rsquo;s still to this day, sadly,</p>
<p>the obvious weakest point for me</p>
<p>is escapes from much worse positions.</p>
<p>That should be worked on.</p>
<p>That should have been worked on from the very beginning.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s still, today, if I were to say</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the weakest thing that I should work on,</p>
<p>absolutely, is even with one day a week is escapes.</p>
<p>But yeah, a lot of that has to do with just carrying,</p>
<p>like focusing on the one thing over and over and over</p>
<p>and over across training sessions.</p>
<p>Now, it also, I would write down on a sheet of paper</p>
<p>the number of times I would get an X guard sweep.</p>
<p>And I would set a rule that I have to get</p>
<p>whatever it was, like 500 sweeps a week.</p>
<p>So I have to, and then the closer you get</p>
<p>to the end of the week, the more you just pick up</p>
<p>a small wipeout.</p>
<p>500 in a week?</p>
<p>Yeah, sometimes.</p>
<p>Your training partners must suck, bro.</p>
<p>No, you start with good ones,</p>
<p>and then you just get more and more desperate.</p>
<p>You start finding the kid, right,</p>
<p>that you can just sweep over and over.</p>
<p>For me, the numbers, for some reason,</p>
<p>it set a goal to pull off a technique.</p>
<p>It enforced, like we&rsquo;re staying with this for a while.</p>
<p>This is a journey we&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>And then for some reason, for me,</p>
<p>that helped me focus the study</p>
<p>to understand the deep complexities of this thing.</p>
<p>That, at least for me, other people,</p>
<p>like nobody at the gym was doing X guard</p>
<p>or anything of that.</p>
<p>So you had to kind of figure everything out yourself.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s better ways to do that,</p>
<p>but at least that focus helps from a hobbyist perspective.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the day, what&rsquo;s the perfect day</p>
<p>in the life of John Donner?</p>
<p>If we&rsquo;re talking about a basic non-ADCC,</p>
<p>now you&rsquo;re, I&rsquo;m really grateful</p>
<p>that you sit down with me on a Sunday, late at night,</p>
<p>but it all starts again for you tomorrow.</p>
<p>So three training sessions a day.</p>
<p>What time do you wake up?</p>
<p>Do you do like a mantra in the morning?</p>
<p>Do you listen to like some Zen music?</p>
<p>What do you eat in the morning?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the perfect day look like?</p>
<p>When you sacrifice a small animal?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>To the gods.</p>
<p>I usually,</p>
<p>when you say a perfect day,</p>
<p>what I think you really mean is an average day.</p>
<p>Perfectly productive average day.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s take Monday morning.</p>
<p>For you watching this video,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re filming this late on a Sunday night.</p>
<p>So after this, I&rsquo;ll drive home.</p>
<p>We just had ADCC.</p>
<p>It was two weeks ago.</p>
<p>It was one of the longest training camps.</p>
<p>It was the longest training camp I&rsquo;ve ever run,</p>
<p>because of the fact that we had to go</p>
<p>through three different matches</p>
<p>for Gordon Ryan leading up to it.</p>
<p>So immediately after ADCC,</p>
<p>I cut the training down for the competitive athletes</p>
<p>to one session per day for the first week after ADCC</p>
<p>to give their bodies a bit of a break.</p>
<p>I still have to teach two classes in addition to that,</p>
<p>two recreational classes.</p>
<p>So my teaching schedule went down to three classes per day.</p>
<p>After one week of relative break,</p>
<p>we go back to two competition classes per day,</p>
<p>plus two recreational classes,</p>
<p>plus an MMA class for Gary Tonin and his friends.</p>
<p>The first class requires me to get up around 6 a.m.</p>
<p>to drive.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still a student driver,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m not very good at driving.</p>
<p>So I have to spend a little extra time</p>
<p>to get to the destination on time.</p>
<p>Just for the record,</p>
<p>John pulled in in a red Lamborghini with a, no.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re the worst liar I&rsquo;ve ever met.</p>
<p>My day typically starts pretty early.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t eat in the morning.</p>
<p>I just get up and go to work.</p>
<p>And I teach through the day.</p>
<p>My last class finishes usually around 8 p.m.</p>
<p>During that time, I coach jiu-jitsu.</p>
<p>I try to find time for one Instagram post per day,</p>
<p>which usually describes some basic theme of jiu-jitsu</p>
<p>in most cases, unless we&rsquo;ve just had a competition,</p>
<p>in which case I&rsquo;ll talk about upcoming competitions</p>
<p>or what happens after a competition.</p>
<p>But most of them just express a simple jiu-jitsu theme.</p>
<p>I try to do a short workout for myself.</p>
<p>And then I go home.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, I always start by asking myself,</p>
<p>what do my students need from me tomorrow,</p>
<p>based on what I&rsquo;ve seen today?</p>
<p>What do the recreational students need?</p>
<p>And what do the competitive students need?</p>
<p>This is always done in the light of</p>
<p>what are the upcoming competitions.</p>
<p>But throughout the day,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing a lot of really in-depth classes.</p>
<p>So how do you either prepare for them</p>
<p>or think through them as they&rsquo;re happening?</p>
<p>Think through the material that you&rsquo;re teaching.</p>
<p>I can look at a class.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been doing this a long time.</p>
<p>So I can just look at a class and be like,</p>
<p>okay, these guys need this, this, and this.</p>
<p>And then I make reflections at the end of the day.</p>
<p>Then I&rsquo;ll take care of things that we all do.</p>
<p>Talk to family.</p>
<p>Occasionally go out for dinner with friends.</p>
<p>Dates, things like that.</p>
<p>Yeah, Henzo had to really harass you,</p>
<p>to drag you out to hang out.</p>
<p>And he was very convincing.</p>
<p>And food-wise?</p>
<p>I eat once a day.</p>
<p>Eat once a day.</p>
<p>Yeah, at the end of the day,</p>
<p>I usually stop off at a place like a supermarket,</p>
<p>like Whole Foods or some equivalent to that,</p>
<p>and buy something simple and eat.</p>
<p>The internet wants to know the details.</p>
<p>Did you end up getting Wi-Fi for your apartment?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still thinking about it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What are the pros and cons?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no cons, lots of pros,</p>
<p>but I just don&rsquo;t put much importance to it.</p>
<p>Things that are unimportant, I just ignore.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s a lot of things in life</p>
<p>that have a lot of pros,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re lower on the priority list.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Why, because of the 5G already?</p>
<p>5G&rsquo;s got it covered.</p>
<p>Do you watch much video?</p>
<p>Do you watch video?</p>
<p>Do you watch footage?</p>
<p>Video footage, quite often, yeah.</p>
<p>Especially things from freestyle wrestling,</p>
<p>Greco-Roman wrestling, judo,</p>
<p>and mixed martial arts.</p>
<p>Also, subsidiary sports to mixed martial arts,</p>
<p>like boxing, Muay Thai, and European kickboxing.</p>
<p>Just for long-term idea generation?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Like a plant, a seed, an idea.</p>
<p>Yeah, this is an interesting thing.</p>
<p>How could this be incorporated in the context</p>
<p>in which we use it, MMA or jiu-jitsu?</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s immediately obvious,</p>
<p>or it might become obvious in a few weeks or months.</p>
<p>Is there some aspect to the way you approach life</p>
<p>and training and martial arts</p>
<p>that amends itself to minimalism?</p>
<p>It seems like you live a pretty stoic life.</p>
<p>Or is that just a symptom of a focused existence?</p>
<p>My life wasn&rsquo;t always like this.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve gone through different phases in my life.</p>
<p>I was a university student and teacher at university.</p>
<p>I was a nightclub bouncer for more than a decade.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been through different areas of life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen most things.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve experienced a lot.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve traveled the world.</p>
<p>At this point in my life,</p>
<p>people think I live some kind of monk-like existence,</p>
<p>but I have a private life.</p>
<p>I like to go out and have fun like everyone else.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not some kind of monk who just sits under a waterfall</p>
<p>and meditates or anything crazy like that.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m currently going through that stage of my life,</p>
<p>the monk-like existence.</p>
<p>So I would be amiss not to ask you</p>
<p>one of the most important questions</p>
<p>one can possibly ask John Donahar,</p>
<p>which is on the topic of animal combat.</p>
<p>Who wins in a fight to the death?</p>
<p>Or maybe in a sport competition setting,</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s go with a fight to the death.</p>
<p>A grizzly bear, a silverback gorilla,</p>
<p>and maybe a lion or tiger, an African lion,</p>
<p>or one of the flavors of tiger.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know who you think is more ferocious.</p>
<p>What are the parameters to consider here?</p>
<p>Maybe I can throw a few out</p>
<p>and maybe you can give me some thoughts</p>
<p>about how much of these parameters matter.</p>
<p>So first of all, intelligence.</p>
<p>I do believe the gorilla is the most intelligent.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve did research for this, as you can imagine.</p>
<p>Solo or with Joe Rogan?</p>
<p>The expert advisor to this very podcast</p>
<p>on this very topic is indeed Joe Rogan, yes.</p>
<p>So in captivity, gorillas have been documented</p>
<p>to show complex emotions, form family bonds,</p>
<p>the ability to use tools,</p>
<p>and to be able to reason about the past and the future.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s impressive.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s something that, at least in captivity,</p>
<p>the other animals have not been able to do.</p>
<p>They already sound much more advanced than I am.</p>
<p>Yeah, so that&rsquo;s intelligence.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s intelligence.</p>
<p>Then there is weight.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s something that you think of at first.</p>
<p>The lion, let&rsquo;s go with the big ones.</p>
<p>I took notes here.</p>
<p>550 pounds for a big lion.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s exceptionally large.</p>
<p>Most male lions are around 450 pounds.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an exceptional beast then.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>The tiger can be larger than that.</p>
<p>Yeah, much, much larger.</p>
<p>So we got the grizzly bear,</p>
<p>which is probably the biggest of the bunch.</p>
<p>The large ones get to 1,500 pounds.</p>
<p>Correct me if some of these numbers are-</p>
<p>I believe most grizzlies are around 1,000 pound mark.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a big, big beast.</p>
<p>I was looking up the biggest,</p>
<p>but I didn&rsquo;t want to do the biggest ever.</p>
<p>Just what are the big, like the top of the range,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s always a range.</p>
<p>You can put it in at roughly double</p>
<p>that of even a very big lion.</p>
<p>Of course, how that weight is used is very important.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s also things,</p>
<p>which I find as interesting as anaconda,</p>
<p>which just, let me throw that in there,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s 200 pounds.</p>
<p>What I really like about that is it&rsquo;s not just the weight,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the form factor.</p>
<p>And I think out of all of these,</p>
<p>the anaconda is the most non-standard form factor.</p>
<p>I totally agree with that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the knight on the chessboard.</p>
<p>It comes in from a completely different angle.</p>
<p>So we got that.</p>
<p>We got also strength in,</p>
<p>which could be measured in ability to carry stuff.</p>
<p>So this was surprising to me.</p>
<p>I did look into this carefully.</p>
<p>The grizzly bear at 1,000 or 1,500 pounds</p>
<p>can only carry at most its body weight, which is a lot.</p>
<p>But a gorilla can carry 10 times its body weight.</p>
<p>A gorilla can lift over 2,000 kilograms,</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s over 4,000 pounds.</p>
<p>And gorillas themselves, an adult male,</p>
<p>weighs in around 350 to 400.</p>
<p>400 pounds, yes.</p>
<p>So I like how in this particular place</p>
<p>where I found this, 2,000 kilograms</p>
<p>is as heavy as 30 average humans.</p>
<p>So a gorilla can carry 30 humans.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s carrying strength.</p>
<p>And then of course, bite force,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s one of the weapons in question here.</p>
<p>So now this is really surprising to me.</p>
<p>The gorilla has won me over through this, by the way.</p>
<p>Intelligence, I&rsquo;m a sucker for intelligence,</p>
<p>but the gorilla bite force is the highest of all these,</p>
<p>with 1,300 PSI.</p>
<p>Bear is second with 1,200 PSI.</p>
<p>Tiger is a third.</p>
<p>I think tiger and lion is third with 1,000 PSI.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s comparable.</p>
<p>And a bear is anywhere from 900 to 1,000 PSI.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re close, but gorilla, I would not have expected.</p>
<p>Now, a gorilla is not a carnivore,</p>
<p>but apparently it chews.</p>
<p>It mostly eats grassy stuff, but it like-</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s difficult to explain why it has such a powerful bite.</p>
<p>And it also, of course, has very large incisor teeth</p>
<p>as well as chewing teeth.</p>
<p>So-</p>
<p>Also, no neck.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So its neck begins at the top of its head</p>
<p>and this goes down to the shoulders.</p>
<p>Well, a lot of the way they use their teeth,</p>
<p>all of these animals,</p>
<p>the ultimate kill is to go for the neck.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know exactly why that is.</p>
<p>Probably has to do&hellip;</p>
<p>Why is that?</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s a very strong controlling position,</p>
<p>not just that it&rsquo;s a&hellip;</p>
<p>Is it the same as jiu-jitsu, you think?</p>
<p>Because they get to also choke them out?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very much in line with jiu-jitsu.</p>
<p>Lions are famous for using strangulation</p>
<p>as their primary method of killing.</p>
<p>They get a hold of the neck</p>
<p>and hold it until the animal drops.</p>
<p>Plus, claws.</p>
<p>I believe the tiger and the bear use their claws.</p>
<p>And the lion too.</p>
<p>The lion, right.</p>
<p>And the lion.</p>
<p>This is something that the gorilla doesn&rsquo;t do.</p>
<p>And anaconda obviously doesn&rsquo;t do.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>So what do you think?</p>
<p>How do we think about this?</p>
<p>Also, there is&hellip;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just not letting you talk, apparently.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s levels of aggression in terms of-</p>
<p>These are also very important considerations.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What is most important to you?</p>
<p>All the considerations you&rsquo;ve raised are very important</p>
<p>and we would have to address them</p>
<p>if we&rsquo;re gonna go through this topic.</p>
<p>First things first,</p>
<p>whenever you go into a discussion of this kind,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a kind of natural impression that we all have</p>
<p>as to which one would be the most formidable.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s important that you become rather skeptical</p>
<p>of your first intuitions</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re often very misleading.</p>
<p>Just as every boy thinks his father</p>
<p>is the strongest man in the world.</p>
<p>And then when he grows up into adulthood,</p>
<p>he realizes his father was not even close</p>
<p>to being the strongest man in the world.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not because of anything other than inexperience.</p>
<p>To a boy, his father seems overwhelmingly strong.</p>
<p>He literally can&rsquo;t even imagine</p>
<p>anyone else being stronger than that.</p>
<p>So naively, he thinks his father</p>
<p>is the strongest man in the world.</p>
<p>So too in our relationship with animals.</p>
<p>When we look at a silverback gorilla,</p>
<p>it just looks overwhelmingly strong to us</p>
<p>to a degree which is almost absurd.</p>
<p>You picture the greatest combat athletes</p>
<p>that humanity has ever produced.</p>
<p>Prime Mike Tyson, Gordon Ryan for grappling.</p>
<p>They would literally be torn limb from limb</p>
<p>by an angry gorilla.</p>
<p>It wouldn&rsquo;t even be remotely competitive.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s a sense in which we look at them in awe</p>
<p>because of what they could do to us.</p>
<p>But that can be very misleading.</p>
<p>And just as a boy looks at his father</p>
<p>as like the pinnacle of strength,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t necessarily,</p>
<p>from a position of inexperience and weakness,</p>
<p>look at a given animal and say,</p>
<p>oh, that must be the toughest animal in the animal kingdom.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s levels to this game.</p>
<p>And I think we can point out that the gorilla</p>
<p>ultimately would be pretty low on those levels</p>
<p>despite the fearsome appearance.</p>
<p>I have some pushback to this analysis</p>
<p>because the data, we don&rsquo;t have much data on this.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have.</p>
<p>We actually have slightly more than you think, I believe.</p>
<p>Oh boy.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s anecdotal.</p>
<p>I feel like it&rsquo;s out of context.</p>
<p>So these species don&rsquo;t use, this is not MMA.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t do interspecies fighting often.</p>
<p>Yeah, but there are some ways of looking at this</p>
<p>which can take this already interesting question</p>
<p>and make it a lot more interesting.</p>
<p>First, we&rsquo;ve seen that intuitions aren&rsquo;t to be trusted.</p>
<p>So if intuitions aren&rsquo;t to be trusted,</p>
<p>well, what is to be trusted here?</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;ve always believed that there are three</p>
<p>general elements that determine</p>
<p>what level of success or failure</p>
<p>anyone will experience in combat.</p>
<p>And this is true both for individuals and for groups</p>
<p>and even all the way up to nations.</p>
<p>The first is what are your skills?</p>
<p>The second is what are your physical and mental attributes?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s skills, attributes.</p>
<p>Those are the two primary ones.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a third, which is your experience</p>
<p>in using those skills and attributes</p>
<p>in real world scenarios, okay?</p>
<p>So whenever two, we&rsquo;ll start with two humans.</p>
<p>When two humans get into a fight, ask yourself,</p>
<p>what is their skillset?</p>
<p>What are their physical and mental attributes?</p>
<p>And what is their experience</p>
<p>in using those in real world applications?</p>
<p>And that will give you your first look at,</p>
<p>okay, who&rsquo;s gonna be the more successful?</p>
<p>Then in addition to those three general elements,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s also four more specific elements.</p>
<p>What is the ability of the combatants to initiate combat?</p>
<p>Because initiation is a big deal in fighting.</p>
<p>The one who sees the enemy first</p>
<p>and can create ambush conditions</p>
<p>or initiate combat in an area or a terrain</p>
<p>which is favorable to them,</p>
<p>this is huge in determining the outcome of battles.</p>
<p>Second, not only is initiation important,</p>
<p>but disengagement is important.</p>
<p>A lot of battles don&rsquo;t go according to plan.</p>
<p>And so your ability to disengage at will</p>
<p>and break off and away from a battle is key to success.</p>
<p>So initiation and disengagement are big.</p>
<p>The third big element,</p>
<p>what is your ability to end a fight?</p>
<p>Okay, do you have an efficient method of ending conflict?</p>
<p>Without that, the conflict could go on to a point</p>
<p>where you no longer have the ability to continue it.</p>
<p>If you have some succinct method of finishing,</p>
<p>this is huge in combat in determining winner or loser.</p>
<p>So both from a winning and a losing position?</p>
<p>Yes, if you don&rsquo;t have one,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a much higher chance you&rsquo;ll lose.</p>
<p>But if you have an ability to finish an opponent</p>
<p>in the conflict reliably,</p>
<p>this is very, very important</p>
<p>in determining success or failure.</p>
<p>And third, is your ability to endure a conflict</p>
<p>longer than the person you&rsquo;re engaged in?</p>
<p>Okay, engaged with, sorry.</p>
<p>And so you get these four more specific elements now.</p>
<p>Do you have the ability to initiate contact at will?</p>
<p>Do you have the ability to break contact</p>
<p>and disengage at will?</p>
<p>Do you have the ability to finish your opponent efficiently?</p>
<p>And do you have the ability to endure</p>
<p>longer than your opponent does?</p>
<p>If you have all four of those,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s huge for combat.</p>
<p>That probably applies to human-on-human.</p>
<p>Everything.</p>
<p>Military conflict.</p>
<p>Everything, even all the way up to nations.</p>
<p>Also ask yourself,</p>
<p>what are the most efficient</p>
<p>methods of combat</p>
<p>across the globe, across all species,</p>
<p>all times, et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ll see that ultimately,</p>
<p>they always come down to</p>
<p>three things.</p>
<p>The first is concentration of force.</p>
<p>Okay?</p>
<p>One of the most successful combat strategies of all time</p>
<p>is the ability to take concentrated force</p>
<p>against the zone of weakness in your opponent.</p>
<p>And if you can do this,</p>
<p>you will often break through to a point of vulnerability,</p>
<p>attack that vulnerability in a way</p>
<p>where your opponent cannot respond</p>
<p>and cannot recover from that vulnerable point being broken.</p>
<p>Do a high amount of damage with precision.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So this is one of the great combat strategies</p>
<p>across the animal kingdom,</p>
<p>across human history, et cetera.</p>
<p>The second would be ambush tactics.</p>
<p>If you can ambush an opponent with the element of surprise,</p>
<p>this is huge for success in combat.</p>
<p>Almost all of the truly successful predators</p>
<p>on this planet are ambush predators.</p>
<p>The ability to get off to a good start</p>
<p>in a way where opponents simply can&rsquo;t recover</p>
<p>is huge for combat.</p>
<p>Are we allowing ambush in our discussion?</p>
<p>Because humans would call this cheating, perhaps.</p>
<p>Yes, we would.</p>
<p>And humans are pretty damn good at it, too, so.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And then the third is endurance, okay?</p>
<p>Some species, some people,</p>
<p>humans actually are pretty good at this,</p>
<p>use endurance as a weapon.</p>
<p>And they simply wear an opponent down over time</p>
<p>and break them.</p>
<p>Internationally, this can be done economically</p>
<p>through numbers, et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p>And you can destroy someone with your sheer endurance.</p>
<p>Yeah, a lot of wars throughout human history</p>
<p>has been siege warfare.</p>
<p>Yeah, and so when you ask yourself,</p>
<p>okay, which one of these animals</p>
<p>are going to be the most successful in combat?</p>
<p>Ask yourself, well, there&rsquo;s these three elements</p>
<p>which tend to determine successful failure in warfare.</p>
<p>Which animals exhibit these three principles the best?</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll discuss this.</p>
<p>But as far as generalities go,</p>
<p>whenever you ask a question,</p>
<p>who will win between A and B?</p>
<p>Ask yourself in terms of the light</p>
<p>of what we&rsquo;ve just discussed.</p>
<p>What is their skill set?</p>
<p>What are their attributes, both mental and physical?</p>
<p>What is their experience in utilizing these</p>
<p>in real-world situations?</p>
<p>And then the four more tactical elements,</p>
<p>who gets to initiate contact?</p>
<p>Can you break off contact at any given time?</p>
<p>What is your endurance?</p>
<p>Can you keep going longer than your opponent does?</p>
<p>So a skill set, I wonder if a big component of that,</p>
<p>of how much practice there is off the battlefield.</p>
<p>So how much, quote unquote,</p>
<p>you would probably call it play, like play fighting.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start going through our animals, okay?</p>
<p>When you look at the gorilla,</p>
<p>you will see immediately that almost every experience</p>
<p>a gorilla has of combat is theatrical.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t engage in killing things.</p>
<p>They scare rival males away</p>
<p>in order to gain ownership of females.</p>
<p>But there is almost no intra-species death</p>
<p>in those conflicts.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re almost entirely theatrical.</p>
<p>They have, for example, enormous canine teeth,</p>
<p>but there is no record of them ever being used in combat.</p>
<p>They appear to be used purely for intimidation purposes.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a sense in which they have</p>
<p>this tremendous appearance,</p>
<p>and they have tremendous potential.</p>
<p>They really do have freakish levels of strength</p>
<p>in many different ways.</p>
<p>And yet, the actual track record of using it is negligible.</p>
<p>So strange that evolution would develop</p>
<p>such a powerful killing machine.</p>
<p>Like their bite force just makes no sense</p>
<p>with regard to what they actually eat.</p>
<p>I think, well, no, I think they have like-</p>
<p>Even the presence of canines doesn&rsquo;t make a lot of sense.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not gonna use them.</p>
<p>What are they?</p>
<p>It comes down to this idea</p>
<p>of their big thing is intimidation.</p>
<p>So as a show, you wanna fake it</p>
<p>and don&rsquo;t care if you ever make it,</p>
<p>because fake it is good enough</p>
<p>given that particular dynamic.</p>
<p>Now, let&rsquo;s contrast that with a male lion.</p>
<p>Lions take on the biggest, meanest, toughest animals</p>
<p>in the most competitive killing war on planet Earth,</p>
<p>which is continental Africa.</p>
<p>And they literally just take,</p>
<p>I mean, occasionally they lose,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s rare.</p>
<p>And they take out everything.</p>
<p>Just in order to eat,</p>
<p>they have to take down wildebeest, Cape buffalo.</p>
<p>Like Cape buffalo are incredibly dangerous beasts</p>
<p>just by themselves.</p>
<p>And yet, lions regularly take them down.</p>
<p>Occasionally, large numbers of lions</p>
<p>will even swarm elephant</p>
<p>and over 12-hour periods</p>
<p>take down elephant on some occasions.</p>
<p>This is all on video.</p>
<p>This is not just speculation.</p>
<p>So they just have a level of combat experience,</p>
<p>which no other animal can do.</p>
<p>If I were to also project,</p>
<p>so the Eastern European style of wrestling,</p>
<p>where they spend so many hours on the mat,</p>
<p>they really value the number of hours on the mat</p>
<p>at play from childhood.</p>
<p>The lions probably,</p>
<p>from my extensive watching videos on YouTube,</p>
<p>they seem to play with each other for fun a lot.</p>
<p>And I guess with the gorilla-</p>
<p>Even as cubs, you see it.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t interact,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t play with other gorillas.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re more spending a lot more time</p>
<p>around the opposite sex.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So, yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, even lions,</p>
<p>when they fight each other,</p>
<p>the mortality rate when lions fight each other,</p>
<p>male lions, for ownership of a pride,</p>
<p>is very, very high.</p>
<p>Much, much higher than, I believe,</p>
<p>any other species on Earth.</p>
<p>They almost always fights to the death,</p>
<p>for the simple reason that</p>
<p>when a male lion loses control of a pride,</p>
<p>the first act the new lion does</p>
<p>is to kill the genetic offspring of the previous male lion.</p>
<p>So when a lion fights another male lion,</p>
<p>when one male lion fights another,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not just a fight for his own life,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a fight for his genetic offspring.</p>
<p>And failure means not only does he die,</p>
<p>all his offspring dies.</p>
<p>And so when they fight,</p>
<p>the implications are so deep.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a fight for your,</p>
<p>not just you, but your DNA.</p>
<p>Most male lions have very short runs at the top.</p>
<p>They get killed or run off by other lions.</p>
<p>Now, this kind of harsh combat experience,</p>
<p>no other animal can claim to have this.</p>
<p>Between what they kill to eat</p>
<p>and what they have to do to defend their stake in a pride,</p>
<p>no other animal fights like that.</p>
<p>They just bring a level of depth to combat</p>
<p>which is unmatched in the animal kingdom.</p>
<p>They also have some other elements too,</p>
<p>that they get the luxury because of their social nature</p>
<p>of taking more risks than other animals.</p>
<p>Like a tiger hunts alone.</p>
<p>So if it gets injured, it&rsquo;s a big problem.</p>
<p>It can die if it&rsquo;s injured.</p>
<p>A lion can fight Cape Buffalo,</p>
<p>get injured and be covered by the other lions for food</p>
<p>until it recovers.</p>
<p>So it learns to take risks</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not afraid to go out and fight very, very hard.</p>
<p>Whereas other animals tend to shy away from risk</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re solitary.</p>
<p>Bears are solitary, tigers are solitary.</p>
<p>So they learn from an early age</p>
<p>not to take the big risks,</p>
<p>to go up to a certain level and stop.</p>
<p>If I could push back.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s aggression and risk-taking.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a plus for the lion.</p>
<p>But to defend the gorilla,</p>
<p>because you said skillset,</p>
<p>they are of all of those,</p>
<p>the only ones that use tools,</p>
<p>have shown to use tools.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t say anything about weapons.</p>
<p>A gorilla could in theory pick up a rock</p>
<p>and it does have the force, the power,</p>
<p>and the capabilities to do a lot of damage.</p>
<p>So it doesn&rsquo;t have the practice.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t have the experience.</p>
<p>But don&rsquo;t you think if a gorilla&rsquo;s back is to the wall,</p>
<p>so you put them in a situation of it is life and death</p>
<p>for both the lion and the gorilla.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t you value intelligence at least a little bit here?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a reason why humans,</p>
<p>this is like evidence that humans have spread</p>
<p>all across the world while being kind of weak.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Okay, intelligence is a huge, huge asset.</p>
<p>Humanity is positive proof</p>
<p>that it is the most important asset.</p>
<p>But it takes time in order to work its magic.</p>
<p>It took humans 200,000 years</p>
<p>to go from the bottom of the food chain</p>
<p>to the top of the food chain.</p>
<p>And gorillas have a lot of work to do</p>
<p>before they get to that level.</p>
<p>There is, you said in theory, gorillas could do this.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s talk about practice now.</p>
<p>First off, there are many documented incidents</p>
<p>of leopards killing gorillas.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s anecdotal evidence.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s not anecdotal.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a bunch of bitch ass gorillas walking around.</p>
<p>We know this.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re asking.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not anecdotal.</p>
<p>It was observed by a group of people</p>
<p>who specialized in observing gorillas</p>
<p>over a 12-year period.</p>
<p>They regularly found gorilla toes in leopard defecation.</p>
<p>They also saw that over a certain period,</p>
<p>some 36 gorillas had been killed.</p>
<p>And evidence strongly suggested</p>
<p>leopard predation was the reason.</p>
<p>Apparently, leopards had figured out</p>
<p>that there was a femoral artery in gorillas&rsquo; legs</p>
<p>and were doing a move which,</p>
<p>from the sounds of it, sounds a lot like a Barambolo,</p>
<p>where they were spinning underneath gorillas</p>
<p>and biting the femoral artery and then disengaging</p>
<p>and watching them bleed out and die and then eating them.</p>
<p>Now, a leopard is no match for a lion.</p>
<p>The only defense it has to a lion is to run up a tree.</p>
<p>It cannot engage with a lion</p>
<p>on anything close to equal terms.</p>
<p>It may seem like we&rsquo;re going on tangents, but we&rsquo;re not,</p>
<p>just because of the foot,</p>
<p>the attack of the artery on the foot.</p>
<p>Is there weaknesses that the lion might have of that?</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m saying is, I know it&rsquo;s not equivalent,</p>
<p>but the fact that a leopard does so well</p>
<p>against even fully grown male gorillas</p>
<p>should make you rather suspicious</p>
<p>of a gorilla&rsquo;s ability to fight a lion.</p>
<p>Fair enough.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s also go further into this.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about concentration of force.</p>
<p>A lion has the quintessential concentration of force,</p>
<p>which is fangs and claws.</p>
<p>Now, the gorilla is the exact opposite.</p>
<p>It can&rsquo;t even make a fist.</p>
<p>And so it can only throw open-handed slaps and grab things.</p>
<p>So it has no ability with its arms to concentrate force</p>
<p>in any kind of efficient way.</p>
<p>When a lion or a tiger, or a bear for that matter,</p>
<p>swings at you, it&rsquo;s got four claws</p>
<p>from four to six inches long.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like four blades going into you.</p>
<p>They can retract their claws, so they&rsquo;re always sharp.</p>
<p>But the reach is significantly longer for the gorilla.</p>
<p>The length of the-</p>
<p>The ability to engage with speed</p>
<p>on the part of the cats is far, far greater.</p>
<p>And also mobility on two feet,</p>
<p>the bipedal nature of a gorilla, the temporary bipedal.</p>
<p>The bear has the same, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>No impact.</p>
<p>Humans are bipedal,</p>
<p>and lions kill 240 humans a year on average.</p>
<p>So, okay, okay, okay.</p>
<p>What about bear?</p>
<p>Now, bear is a different proposition.</p>
<p>Has all the same things that a lion has.</p>
<p>The claws, the teeth, has more weight,</p>
<p>has more strength, has more power.</p>
<p>Okay, now this is an interesting question.</p>
<p>Okay, you get a fully grown North American grizzly</p>
<p>versus an African lion.</p>
<p>This is an interesting battle.</p>
<p>I also have questions about polar bears.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s unclear to me,</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re bigger in every way than a grizzly.</p>
<p>But they probably don&rsquo;t get the experience</p>
<p>and the practice.</p>
<p>Yeah, also they have a much more limited set of animals</p>
<p>that they prey upon.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m pretty sure grizzly is gonna be tough to beat</p>
<p>as far as top bear goes.</p>
<p>A grizzly bear, I believe, would be a formidable adversary,</p>
<p>even for a male lion.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re literally twice their size.</p>
<p>They have an ability to get away from strangleholds</p>
<p>by standing up on two legs.</p>
<p>So the lion&rsquo;s primary method of killing,</p>
<p>which is to strangle,</p>
<p>would be very difficult for them to employ upon a bear.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the bear&rsquo;s primary method of killing</p>
<p>is to pin.</p>
<p>It pins animals and then just slowly eats them</p>
<p>while they&rsquo;re still alive.</p>
<p>They have a rather barbaric means of killing.</p>
<p>Lions are much more humane in the way they kill.</p>
<p>So what I see as the primary problem</p>
<p>is that neither one would be able to kill the other.</p>
<p>That finishing thing that you mentioned.</p>
<p>Yeah, they would both fail on the finishing criteria.</p>
<p>The lion would not be able to strangle a bear.</p>
<p>Even in the best case scenario</p>
<p>where he got his teeth into the neck,</p>
<p>the bear can stand up and presumably shake him off.</p>
<p>The bear would never be able to pin a lion</p>
<p>for long enough to be able to hold it down</p>
<p>and slowly maul it over time</p>
<p>the way it can with an elk or a caribou.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t believe either would be able to finish the other.</p>
<p>They would just become exhausted.</p>
<p>It would come down to endurance.</p>
<p>Now that&rsquo;s where things get interesting</p>
<p>because the bear is much more of an endurance hunter</p>
<p>and the lion is much more of an ambush hunter.</p>
<p>Lions, quick, explosive, much higher top speed.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve got a top speed of 45 to 50 miles an hour.</p>
<p>A bear can do up to 35, but it can run for long periods</p>
<p>at up to 25 miles an hour, very long periods.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re mostly an endurance hunter.</p>
<p>They just run elk and moose down until they&rsquo;re exhausted</p>
<p>and then pin them and kill them.</p>
<p>So if it came down to endurance,</p>
<p>might go the way of the bear</p>
<p>if they were caged up together.</p>
<p>However, there is very strong evidence</p>
<p>from both hunters and video,</p>
<p>which shows on many occasions,</p>
<p>bears being chased off by cougar and wolverines.</p>
<p>Now-</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s that?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fear?</p>
<p>What is that?</p>
<p>What do you mean chased off?</p>
<p>If they fight over meat,</p>
<p>and say that, for example, a cougar has killed something</p>
<p>and the bear wants the meat,</p>
<p>the cougar will-</p>
<p>The bear has risk aversion.</p>
<p>Exactly, exactly.</p>
<p>The bears are risk averse.</p>
<p>What I would say is this,</p>
<p>the bears are very, very powerful in their domain,</p>
<p>but they don&rsquo;t have the battle experience of a lion.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t take on animals as tough as a Cape buffalo.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t take on elephant.</p>
<p>The toughest thing it would probably take on</p>
<p>would probably be a bull moose.</p>
<p>And a bull moose is a formidable animal,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s nothing like a Cape buffalo.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s nothing like an elephant or a hippopotamus.</p>
<p>So what I would suggest is this,</p>
<p>in the wild, I don&rsquo;t believe either one</p>
<p>is capable of killing the other,</p>
<p>but I do believe based on video evidence</p>
<p>of cougars and wolverines chasing off bears,</p>
<p>that a lion would provide enough threat</p>
<p>in a brief fight that a bear would back away.</p>
<p>If you put them in a cage, however,</p>
<p>where neither one could back away,</p>
<p>I would slightly favor the bear</p>
<p>based on the fact that neither one can kill each other,</p>
<p>it would come down to endurance.</p>
<p>You mean like an octagon?</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s gotta be the next UFC, by the way,</p>
<p>bear versus lion.</p>
<p>But things change.</p>
<p>Joe Rogan is a big fan of the idea of fighting in a stadium,</p>
<p>for humans fighting in a stadium.</p>
<p>So in a stadium, a bear-</p>
<p>I would slightly favor a bear.</p>
<p>Now, I still think that the lion would have a chance,</p>
<p>but I would favor the bear in a betting match.</p>
<p>Some of the best evidence we have</p>
<p>for animal versus animal fights</p>
<p>come from the ancient Romans,</p>
<p>who actually used to put animals in gladiatorial combat.</p>
<p>And they, for example, had several incidents</p>
<p>where they wrote about tiger versus lion conflict.</p>
<p>And in one famous passage,</p>
<p>they described a lion getting destroyed by a female tiger.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s some evidence to suggest</p>
<p>that they had more expertise of this than we do,</p>
<p>because they had a big population of wild animals,</p>
<p>which they just put to fight each other.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there&rsquo;s nothing that they wrote</p>
<p>about bears versus lion.</p>
<p>They did talk about bears versus bulls,</p>
<p>they did talk about lions versus tigers,</p>
<p>but they never mentioned bear versus lion,</p>
<p>so we don&rsquo;t have any evidence for that.</p>
<p>So we have to be a little bit more speculative.</p>
<p>Now, given that bears do get chased off by cougar,</p>
<p>and cougar is weak compared with a male lion.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s-</p>
<p>Well, what do you draw from that, by the way?</p>
<p>I would suggest that-</p>
<p>Is it about the bear, or is it about the cougar?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more about the bear.</p>
<p>Like, in theory, a bear should be able to crush a cougar.</p>
<p>But it seems to be, the bear is just saying,</p>
<p>this thing could hurt me,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m not gonna risk injury, and backs away.</p>
<p>I think it would back away in the wild from a lion,</p>
<p>but put him in a cage,</p>
<p>and I slightly favor the grizzly, based on endurance.</p>
<p>So the final conclusion,</p>
<p>if you had to just bet everything you own,</p>
<p>so you got, let&rsquo;s say, we got the octagon,</p>
<p>we bring in a bear.</p>
<p>Now, this is, like, legendary bear, okay?</p>
<p>Full-grown grizzly.</p>
<p>Full-grown grizzly, but not only that,</p>
<p>that grizzly has seen some shit.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the most it could have seen?</p>
<p>A bull moose, a caribou?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the toughest opponent it&rsquo;s ever had.</p>
<p>It once, no, no, no, no.</p>
<p>No, this one once ran into a pack of other grizzlies,</p>
<p>and had to fend, and he&rsquo;s got scars.</p>
<p>A pack of grizzlies?</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t a pack of grizzlies, it&rsquo;s solitary.</p>
<p>Wolves, wolves.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s good practice for a bear?</p>
<p>Who attacks a bear?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my point.</p>
<p>Bears don&rsquo;t really live in a competitive environment.</p>
<p>Lions do.</p>
<p>But sometimes it can get desperate,</p>
<p>as it was a pack of wolves.</p>
<p>But a pack of wolves is nothing.</p>
<p>All right, fine.</p>
<p>Lions deal with packs of hyenas.</p>
<p>Okay, what was the, just imagine,</p>
<p>over the past hundred years,</p>
<p>what do you think is the hardest fight</p>
<p>that a grizzly bear has been in?</p>
<p>Like, somewhere in Alaska, we never heard,</p>
<p>all of a sudden, in the middle of the night,</p>
<p>all you hear is the bear just.</p>
<p>Yeah, they don&rsquo;t really, there&rsquo;s nothing that tough.</p>
<p>No, there&rsquo;s gotta been something.</p>
<p>Humans have killed tens of millions of people in wars.</p>
<p>They run away from cougars and wolverines.</p>
<p>No, that&rsquo;s anecdotal evidence.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s gotta be one bear.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s video footage of it.</p>
<p>You can watch it yourself.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s called anecdotal evidence.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s got, I guarantee you, in the dark of the night,</p>
<p>there was an epic battle, of which there&rsquo;s still legend</p>
<p>amongst the bears in that part of Canada.</p>
<p>Who did it battle in Canada?</p>
<p>Moose.</p>
<p>Other bears.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;d go at it.</p>
<p>Yeah, bears fight each other,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s largely theatrical.</p>
<p>They never kill each other.</p>
<p>When lions fight each other,</p>
<p>they kill each other all the time.</p>
<p>Someone would have seen it by now.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>All right, so.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re, my point is that bears,</p>
<p>it just, they wanna get their feet wet.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re giving no credit for gorillas,</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re saying lion wins.</p>
<p>Your money&rsquo;s on the lion.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m saying lion would win in the wild</p>
<p>because they can&rsquo;t kill each other.</p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t end the fight.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one of our most important criteria.</p>
<p>But lions can almost always initiate the action</p>
<p>because they have much better ability</p>
<p>to see at night, for example.</p>
<p>Bears have very average night vision.</p>
<p>Lions have superb night vision.</p>
<p>So at nighttime, they can always initiate the fight.</p>
<p>Lions are natural ambush predators,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s always gonna have the advantage of ambush.</p>
<p>The great advantage that bears have is endurance.</p>
<p>But bears are very risk-averse</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re not used to fighting</p>
<p>like the toughest, toughest animals.</p>
<p>The toughest animal they fight is a moose or a caribou.</p>
<p>These are not even close to the animals</p>
<p>that lions have to go up against on a regular basis.</p>
<p>So if somebody wins, it&rsquo;s gonna be the lion for you.</p>
<p>I still think that the size and endurance of the bear,</p>
<p>if they were locked in a cage together,</p>
<p>I would still favor the bear under those circumstances.</p>
<p>But in the wild, I believe the bear will back away</p>
<p>quickly from the lion.</p>
<p>No time limit, you favor the bear.</p>
<p>What if it&rsquo;s five rounds or five minutes,</p>
<p>championship rounds?</p>
<p>Then I would go with the lion</p>
<p>because the lion has a huge speed advantage.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s gonna-</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna injure it, tear it up, and do immediate damage.</p>
<p>Like, I&rsquo;ll put it this way.</p>
<p>If lion and bear fight, first 15 minutes,</p>
<p>I favor the lion 100%.</p>
<p>But then as time goes by, that size and weight is gonna,</p>
<p>and endurance is gonna have an effect.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll bring up shortly somebody</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s gonna probably disagree with you about some things.</p>
<p>Hopefully it&rsquo;s a grizzly bear</p>
<p>and he comes in and just eats me.</p>
<p>Oh, that would be so epic.</p>
<p>Make a hell of a podcast.</p>
<p>I wonder who he would eat first,</p>
<p>who would look scarier, more delicious.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure.</p>
<p>The black and white could either piss him off.</p>
<p>He would think you were a penguin.</p>
<p>Is that a good thing or not?</p>
<p>Not good.</p>
<p>If it was a polar bear, maybe it&rsquo;s different.</p>
<p>Do you care-</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s no penguins in the North Pole.</p>
<p>Deeply about your, about athletes you coached,</p>
<p>about people in your life.</p>
<p>So I have to ask this question.</p>
<p>If one of those athletes, let&rsquo;s say Gordon Ryan,</p>
<p>now I was the dictator of the world</p>
<p>and this would entertain me,</p>
<p>so I force you and Gordon to do this,</p>
<p>to fight a bear or a lion, Gordon has to,</p>
<p>how would you coach him to do it,</p>
<p>to have any chance of winning?</p>
<p>He goes in empty-handed.</p>
<p>Empty-handed.</p>
<p>You can choose stadium or cage.</p>
<p>Gordon Ryan, empty-handed versus a lion.</p>
<p>You get to choose, lion versus bear.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s up to you.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>My advice would be very simple.</p>
<p>I would say, Gordon, you&rsquo;re fucked.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to die badly.</p>
<p>Choose the lion,</p>
<p>because it will strangle you to death</p>
<p>rather than pin you down and maul you to death.</p>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t we just talk about audacious goals?</p>
<p>With Nicholas Mergoff.</p>
<p>This is not a question of audacious goals.</p>
<p>This is a question of minimizing pain.</p>
<p>So you coach your athletes to quit</p>
<p>before the battle has been fought.</p>
<p>100%, yeah.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t think he has a chance?</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t think he has a chance?</p>
<p>How?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s he going to do?</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s a technical,</p>
<p>first of all, intelligence.</p>
<p>So technical strategy.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s he going to do, a heel hook?</p>
<p>No, well, first of all, maybe.</p>
<p>He can&rsquo;t do a double A.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s got four fucking legs.</p>
<p>Okay, what if Gordon gets any starting position he wants?</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, that&rsquo;s going to be really useful.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t think he can have back control?</p>
<p>On a thousand pound beer?</p>
<p>Yeah, he&rsquo;ll get shaken off?</p>
<p>Shaken off?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;ll get torn off.</p>
<p>With what?</p>
<p>Reach his back.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s got four six inch claws.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to, oh, okay.</p>
<p>I wonder what is the reach?</p>
<p>Whatever he touches, he&rsquo;s going to destroy it.</p>
<p>What if it&rsquo;s not a flexible bear?</p>
<p>So you think there&rsquo;s no control?</p>
<p>What about like a low,</p>
<p>like some kind of controlling position from,</p>
<p>yeah, like you said, Brambo, like from underneath?</p>
<p>Nothing?</p>
<p>This discussion is so insane</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t even know where to begin criticism.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re open-minded enough.</p>
<p>We could turn this down.</p>
<p>Forget about Gordon fighting a lion or a bear.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s completely impossible.</p>
<p>An adult male chimp will destroy Gordon.</p>
<p>So not even a gorilla?</p>
<p>What about the aggression?</p>
<p>Yeah, the aggression.</p>
<p>A male chimp is more than enough</p>
<p>to kill any human on the planet, including Gordon Ryan.</p>
<p>So Gordon Ryan fighting a chimp, a good-sized.</p>
<p>No, a thousand times.</p>
<p>How many times does he win?</p>
<p>He loses a thousand times.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not even competitive.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not even remotely competitive.</p>
<p>Do you think he will disagree?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Do you think anyone will disagree?</p>
<p>Anyone?</p>
<p>Yeah, morons.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Somebody that I think you might know</p>
<p>is a famous actor, Tom Hardy,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s also doing quite a bit of jujitsu.</p>
<p>The reason this makes sense to bring up now</p>
<p>is he&rsquo;s also, I saw, narrating a new Sky original series</p>
<p>called Predators coming out in December</p>
<p>where they follow five different predators</p>
<p>and tell their full story about all the fighting</p>
<p>and the killing and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s doing that.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s like Morgan Freeman</p>
<p>from March of the Penguins.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s Tom Hardy for the Predators.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t, I saw a bear and a lion in the trailer,</p>
<p>but they also had something,</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t watch it too careful,</p>
<p>but they had something like a hyena.</p>
<p>So I think they were talking about,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s a hyena, but something like that,</p>
<p>like pack animals that attack and-</p>
<p>Hyenas are formidable, formidable animals.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not all about size.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about like strategy.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>The most important thing in nature is numbers.</p>
<p>Like, you know, a pack of animals</p>
<p>will always destroy a single animal.</p>
<p>And I think that show in particular</p>
<p>is not a hundred percent about who wins or so on.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about the fascinating stories</p>
<p>of how these predators sort of dominate</p>
<p>their particular environment.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s not about these like artificial matchups.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about giving your environment how to succeed</p>
<p>and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Maybe we could do Gordon Ryan versus a house cat.</p>
<p>Gordon might have a small chance</p>
<p>against the house cat, maybe.</p>
<p>Maybe.</p>
<p>See, now I know you&rsquo;re just trolling me.</p>
<p>I think Gordon has a chance against,</p>
<p>definitely against the smaller apes,</p>
<p>but I have no way of proving it.</p>
<p>And the internet will say I&rsquo;m an idiot.</p>
<p>So there you go.</p>
<p>Yeah, the internet is correct every so often.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a, oh, that&rsquo;s funny enough.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking at Tom&rsquo;s Instagram.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a picture with Hanzo.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s competed recently, which is very cool in jujitsu.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s awesome.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s tough to do for a celebrity to step up.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, absolutely, yeah.</p>
<p>He used to consult with me a little bit</p>
<p>on moves when he was starting out.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a very, very nice person.</p>
<p>Oh, about jujitsu?</p>
<p>Yeah, he asked questions about jujitsu.</p>
<p>He struck me as being a very, very nice person.</p>
<p>I would love to be a fly on that wall,</p>
<p>but he made a post on Instagram,</p>
<p>which I&rsquo;d love to get your opinion on.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very much like a John Donahue style</p>
<p>of digging into the philosophy</p>
<p>of the impact of jujitsu on one&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>Is his Instagram post 18 pages long?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Oh, he&rsquo;s got potential then.</p>
<p>With a profound, deep picture</p>
<p>of somebody practicing the art of jujitsu.</p>
<p>I think he&rsquo;s at least a trainee in this art</p>
<p>of the Donahue style of communication.</p>
<p>If Miyamoto Musashi would be alive today,</p>
<p>he would probably be doing these five page</p>
<p>Instagram posts like you do.</p>
<p>Addiction, writes Tom Hardy.</p>
<p>Addiction is difficult and complex stuff</p>
<p>to navigate as is mental health.</p>
<p>Subjects which are both deeply personal for me</p>
<p>and extremely close to my heart.</p>
<p>It is an honor to be able to represent the charity</p>
<p>of my team, RE-ORG, and the great work they do</p>
<p>supporting the mental health and wellbeing</p>
<p>of veterans of service, military and first responders</p>
<p>through the therapeutic benefits of jujitsu</p>
<p>and fitness training.</p>
<p>He represented them in this competition</p>
<p>that he competed in.</p>
<p>Simple training for me as a hobby</p>
<p>and a private love has been fundamentally key</p>
<p>to further develop a deeper sense of inner resilience,</p>
<p>calm and wellbeing.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t stress the importance it has had</p>
<p>and the impact of my life and my fellow teammates.</p>
<p>And he goes on to talk about this organization,</p>
<p>RE-ORG that uses Brazilian jujitsu to form a therapy</p>
<p>to overcome physical and mental challenges,</p>
<p>strengthen social connections</p>
<p>and improve overall health and wellbeing.</p>
<p>This is for veterans, for people going through PTSD.</p>
<p>They have saved lives around the world</p>
<p>by not only providing an effective and positive means</p>
<p>for navigating and managing</p>
<p>the challenging psychological aspects</p>
<p>of military and first responder careers,</p>
<p>but also has allowed many to find</p>
<p>a renewed sense of purpose, identity and community</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s often lost when transitioning to civilian life.</p>
<p>Do you have thoughts about that?</p>
<p>Sort of the effects of jujitsu on folks</p>
<p>who&rsquo;ve gone through some really difficult</p>
<p>things in their life.</p>
<p>First off, I think that&rsquo;s just a beautiful statement</p>
<p>by Mr. Hardy, I must give him a phone call after this</p>
<p>and talk to him, that was beautiful to read.</p>
<p>One thing that&rsquo;s always struck me</p>
<p>when I train people who either have a military background</p>
<p>or on more than a few occasions,</p>
<p>we have special forces soldiers come in</p>
<p>and train with us for a week or two.</p>
<p>And when you talk to them,</p>
<p>the overwhelming sentiment I get</p>
<p>when the conversation&rsquo;s over and we go our separate ways</p>
<p>is I&rsquo;m always asking myself,</p>
<p>the transition from military life,</p>
<p>especially the more extreme military lives</p>
<p>of special forces soldiers back to civilian life,</p>
<p>it must be the craziest experience of all.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got people who are fighting and dying</p>
<p>alongside their comrades in the most extreme circumstances</p>
<p>that any human being can go through.</p>
<p>And then they&rsquo;re pulled back into a life</p>
<p>where people are arguing with them over parking spots.</p>
<p>Just like the average person&rsquo;s day-to-day life</p>
<p>is so mundane that imagine</p>
<p>what must be going through a man&rsquo;s head</p>
<p>who a few weeks or months ago was literally fighting</p>
<p>for his life and his comrades lives,</p>
<p>watching people that he loved die</p>
<p>or get mutilated in front of him.</p>
<p>Things that in a matter of seconds,</p>
<p>people&rsquo;s lives can be torn apart and change forever.</p>
<p>And then suddenly you get thrown into a life</p>
<p>where people are arguing over who&rsquo;s cut who off,</p>
<p>who in line to buy a coffee.</p>
<p>The intensity of camaraderie and love</p>
<p>that you have for each other.</p>
<p>And then you go from incredible intensity in war</p>
<p>to just mundane, boring life.</p>
<p>And going from one to the other</p>
<p>where people are yelling at you or nagging you</p>
<p>over issues that just seem so inconsequential</p>
<p>compared to what you&rsquo;ve been through.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re supposed to take these people seriously</p>
<p>and listen to them.</p>
<p>But not only that, you do have trauma visions</p>
<p>of dead brothers and sisters.</p>
<p>And you feel like you can&rsquo;t really talk</p>
<p>to these civilians about it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing in their experience</p>
<p>that would enable you to have a conversation with them.</p>
<p>Like they don&rsquo;t even,</p>
<p>how do you talk to your new girlfriend</p>
<p>about watching one of your friend&rsquo;s legs get taken off?</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s no conversation you could have with them.</p>
<p>So I find that typically they do best</p>
<p>when they hang out with each other</p>
<p>because they have shared experience</p>
<p>and they can talk about these things.</p>
<p>But I do find that most jiu-jitsu schools</p>
<p>have something like a kind of military barracks</p>
<p>demeanor to them of like camaraderie,</p>
<p>hard work, shared hard work, teamwork,</p>
<p>building towards a goal over time,</p>
<p>the acquisition of skills.</p>
<p>Usually along with that, a kind of,</p>
<p>for want of a better word,</p>
<p>rustic and primitive sense of humor</p>
<p>and a kind of soldierly way of talking to each other</p>
<p>and disparaging self-deprecating sense of humor.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s something that most people with military service</p>
<p>kind of naturally come into</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s part of what they were in.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s like a toned down version of it</p>
<p>which enables them to form a stepping stone</p>
<p>between the military life that they were in</p>
<p>all the way down to civilian life.</p>
<p>And jiu-jitsu is kind of like a bridge between those two.</p>
<p>And also the honesty.</p>
<p>So you said like the skill acquisition,</p>
<p>the honesty of really testing that skill.</p>
<p>There is a deep honesty to war in a distant way,</p>
<p>but in a way there is an honesty to jiu-jitsu too,</p>
<p>of technique, working and not.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a final, there is simulated death.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not real death, it&rsquo;s simulated death on the mat.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a similar kind of honesty there.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s also a similar kind of esteem towards skill</p>
<p>just as regular soldiers look up to special forces soldiers</p>
<p>because they see them as people who have</p>
<p>greater skills than themselves, something to aspire to.</p>
<p>So too in jiu-jitsu,</p>
<p>the thing that we esteem most on a jiu-jitsu mat is skill.</p>
<p>No one gives a damn what you look like</p>
<p>or what you think that you judge mostly by your skill level.</p>
<p>And so they tend to identify with that.</p>
<p>I do think that most people from a military background</p>
<p>kind of find a natural gravitation</p>
<p>towards the atmosphere of jiu-jitsu learning.</p>
<p>And if it proves to be a positive way for them</p>
<p>to rehabilitate and come back into civilian lives,</p>
<p>then that&rsquo;s a wonderful, wonderful thing.</p>
<p>I know we&rsquo;re linked with We Defy,</p>
<p>which is an organization which caters to former soldiers</p>
<p>who were badly injured in combat</p>
<p>and many of whom lost limbs</p>
<p>and always suffered mental trauma.</p>
<p>And they come in and train,</p>
<p>and they often speak very, very highly</p>
<p>of the degree to which jiu-jitsu has helped them</p>
<p>come back into civilian life.</p>
<p>And for them, it&rsquo;s even worse</p>
<p>because they come back not only mentally</p>
<p>but physically disadvantaged after war.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve always been proud to be associated with We Defy.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m very happy to see Tom working with this organization.</p>
<p>Is this an organization based in England</p>
<p>for English veterans or is it international?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good question.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d have to look into it.</p>
<p>It certainly is based in England,</p>
<p>but it could be international.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s just nice to see somebody use that large platform</p>
<p>for that kind of message.</p>
<p>And also to step on the mat</p>
<p>and show the kind of jiu-jitsu you would probably be proud of</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re chasing submissions.</p>
<p>You got an arm lock, you got a straight foot lock.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not gonna analyze the techniques</p>
<p>because there could be-</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>Different perspectives.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the intent that counts.</p>
<p>The finish is the finish.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, that&rsquo;s impressive.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s actually quite an athlete.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s in great shape and strong and flexible.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m glad he&rsquo;s doing well with his jiu-jitsu.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s good to see Henzo&rsquo;s smiling face next to him.</p>
<p>I can only imagine the conversations.</p>
<p>I have to ask you a deep and important question.</p>
<p>You often, when we text back and forth,</p>
<p>send me two hugging emojis.</p>
<p>Can we psychoanalyze the reason</p>
<p>why that&rsquo;s your favorite emoji of the hugging face?</p>
<p>Is that, it&rsquo;s kind of like sending a heart,</p>
<p>but a little bit more gender neutral.</p>
<p>When jiu-jitsu players meet each other,</p>
<p>they often shake hands and then give a quick hug.</p>
<p>So I thought it was the most appropriate emoji</p>
<p>for jiu-jitsu players.</p>
<p>I see.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a pretty simple explanation.</p>
<p>Nothing too fraught in there.</p>
<p>Are you sure?</p>
<p>Quite sure.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Have you really asked yourself deeply?</p>
<p>Because you really lean on that emoji.</p>
<p>Is there something behind it?</p>
<p>Tomorrow I&rsquo;m never gonna use that emoji again.</p>
<p>Why is there two of them?</p>
<p>Walk away.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll shock you tomorrow and hit you with three.</p>
<p>Three.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost always two.</p>
<p>I think maybe you&rsquo;re a creature of habit in communication.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a creature of habit in almost every aspect of my life.</p>
<p>So even emojis.</p>
<p>Yeah, you fall into these little pockets</p>
<p>of how you communicate,</p>
<p>how you show affection towards others.</p>
<p>I send, I say love a lot.</p>
<p>I send hearts.</p>
<p>And don&rsquo;t give a fuck if it&rsquo;s too like,</p>
<p>me sending a message to a CEO I&rsquo;m about to interview,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll send a heart.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t give a damn.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll probably just look, ugh, what is this?</p>
<p>But I think people are too afraid</p>
<p>of simple communication of affection.</p>
<p>It could be in any form,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a hesitance to that</p>
<p>because I think underneath it,</p>
<p>in order to show affection,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re taking a risk and you&rsquo;re showing vulnerability.</p>
<p>Because if you show affection</p>
<p>and the other person rejects that affection,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve now placed yourself in a hierarchy,</p>
<p>going back to lions, of like, oh, this person,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just like the silly, weak person</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re the strong person.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s how you might see it, I guess.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>To me, the display of vulnerability</p>
<p>is a display of strength, not weakness,</p>
<p>at least in human society, at least at this time.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Let me ask you about love.</p>
<p>I must ask John Donahy about love.</p>
<p>What do you think is the role of love in the human condition</p>
<p>at the highest philosophical level, let me first ask?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>Um.</p>
<p>Like romantic love?</p>
<p>Romantic love, let&rsquo;s say romantic love.</p>
<p>I have one or two areas of apparent expertise in my life.</p>
<p>Romantic love, definitely not one of them.</p>
<p>So like lions versus bears.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m good.</p>
<p>Animal combat.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m good.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re pretty good at.</p>
<p>And then different grappling arts,</p>
<p>judo, sambo, jiu-jitsu.</p>
<p>Decent.</p>
<p>Wrestling, MMA, so fighting and so on.</p>
<p>Romantic love.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t see them as similar?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a kind of fight.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a kind of dance.</p>
<p>By the way, do you?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a sense in which I&rsquo;m kind of glad</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not an expert on that.</p>
<p>Imagine what it would be to be an expert on romantic love.</p>
<p>You would take the one thing in life</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s actually interesting and make it boring.</p>
<p>Because once you develop an expertise about something,</p>
<p>you can start to predict how things are gonna unfold.</p>
<p>You get answers before events even occur.</p>
<p>You see, you can read into the future of everything.</p>
<p>I think there are certain parts of human life</p>
<p>where you want to be a beginner at all times.</p>
<p>And you don&rsquo;t wanna gain expertise.</p>
<p>So excellence and systematizing something</p>
<p>in order to achieve excellence</p>
<p>might destroy the very magic of the thing.</p>
<p>Yes, yes.</p>
<p>And I think that the magic of romantic love</p>
<p>is the fact that we&rsquo;re all beginners at it.</p>
<p>And the minute you try to gain expertise in it,</p>
<p>what does that even mean?</p>
<p>What would it mean?</p>
<p>And would it be good?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it would.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re better off just having fun with it</p>
<p>and plowing through and making dumb mistakes</p>
<p>and looking like a fool.</p>
<p>And then whatever success, whatever that means,</p>
<p>comes in a kind of lighthearted, frivolous kind of way.</p>
<p>And that, I think, is over the course of a lifetime</p>
<p>far more desirable than having expertise</p>
<p>and affairs of love.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s even a good thing to study too much.</p>
<p>And I think if you did,</p>
<p>you would actually take something good out of your life.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s communities of people called pickup artists</p>
<p>that try to optimize this particular aspect,</p>
<p>which is of dating, of guys picking up girls,</p>
<p>and turning that into a system</p>
<p>and seeing what&rsquo;s the most successful.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think that would be,</p>
<p>I mean, maybe the first few months would be good.</p>
<p>And then after that, I think it would be a disaster.</p>
<p>I mean, given that humans are fairly easy to study</p>
<p>from the standpoint of psychology,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s not that difficult to gain expertise</p>
<p>in things like picking people up,</p>
<p>the same way advertisers can pick up your attention</p>
<p>to sell a product.</p>
<p>You can do the same thing, presumably, with romance and sex.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I feel like if you became very good at it,</p>
<p>you would end up being very disappointed by the results.</p>
<p>And so as I said, I think there&rsquo;s some things in life</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s better to be a beginner.</p>
<p>And this is one of those.</p>
<p>Enjoy the chaos, the push and pull of being a beginner</p>
<p>and make that a lifelong journey.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really inspiring to hear you say that.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a deep truth to that.</p>
<p>That also justifies the fact that I suck at it.</p>
<p>I think it also justifies, and it would sell very well,</p>
<p>that John Donahue should write a book on dating.</p>
<p>And that would be chapter one.</p>
<p>Embrace being a beginner.</p>
<p>Chapter two will be bear versus lion.</p>
<p>Pivot quickly to violence.</p>
<p>By the way, we totally skipped over anaconda.</p>
<p>I assumed the implied.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll put it to you this way.</p>
<p>On video, you can watch Puma.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And similar sized cats,</p>
<p>jaguar, destroy anacondas.</p>
<p>No, no.</p>
<p>Even in water, which is anaconda&rsquo;s preferred domain.</p>
<p>So given that Puma and jaguar</p>
<p>are several orders below lion,</p>
<p>you have to go with the idea</p>
<p>that lion would utterly decimate anaconda.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s probably good that we did skip over it.</p>
<p>Going back to the original thought that you had about this,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t trust your first instinct.</p>
<p>Also think about the other elements.</p>
<p>An anaconda has no ability to disengage from the fight.</p>
<p>Once the fight&rsquo;s on, it&rsquo;s gotta go until the end.</p>
<p>It has no ability to disengage and get away.</p>
<p>Its only hope would be ambush.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s got a tiny, tiny chance</p>
<p>against a truly formidable animal.</p>
<p>And the fact that if we look at</p>
<p>actual concrete real world results,</p>
<p>when Puma and jaguar are kicking your ass,</p>
<p>you know, lion and bear is gonna be a lot worse.</p>
<p>Science is not to be found on YouTube,</p>
<p>or rather YouTube is not science.</p>
<p>I bet you there&rsquo;s a bear somewhere in Canada</p>
<p>that has seen some shit.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just gonna leave it at that.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a fan of knives.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s guys like Miyamoto Musashi who,</p>
<p>instead of doing who&rsquo;s number one type of tournaments,</p>
<p>when both competitors walk away,</p>
<p>only one competitor walks away.</p>
<p>Miyamoto Musashi is known for somebody having</p>
<p>John Donahue-like philosophical skills,</p>
<p>but also is known for having fought 61 times</p>
<p>in duels to the death, and won them, obviously.</p>
<p>What do you think made him so good?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t feel qualified to talk about him</p>
<p>because I haven&rsquo;t made an in-depth study</p>
<p>of his life and times.</p>
<p>And we also don&rsquo;t know how much truth there is</p>
<p>to his recollections,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a lot of controversy over this.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t feel like you can give a definitive statement of,</p>
<p>and certainly I can&rsquo;t give a definitive statement</p>
<p>of his prowess, but his writings are fascinating</p>
<p>and deeply insightful.</p>
<p>But as to what actually happened out there in his duels,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s unclear.</p>
<p>But there is, with guys like that,</p>
<p>you almost certainly know that there were people</p>
<p>like the character he projects that have existed,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s 61, whether it&rsquo;s 20,</p>
<p>but people really put their life on the line</p>
<p>in a different time in human history.</p>
<p>Is there something compelling to you</p>
<p>about fighting to the death?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s not just compelling to me, but to anyone.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s nothing we value more than our lives.</p>
<p>And to be able to say, I&rsquo;m prepared to die</p>
<p>for a sense of honor,</p>
<p>things that are so foreign to our modern society.</p>
<p>Imagine, we criticize people</p>
<p>for something as simple as road rage,</p>
<p>and yet you can imagine someone</p>
<p>who has a sufficiently developed sense of honor.</p>
<p>If you took them out of the 17th century</p>
<p>and put them in a modern car,</p>
<p>they might be killing people on the side of the road</p>
<p>on a regular basis, just over the smallest acts of honor.</p>
<p>To say that your sense of self overwhelms</p>
<p>your sense of self-preservation,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a very unusual thing in the modern age,</p>
<p>and yet it appears to have been quite common back then.</p>
<p>You often wear a fanny pack.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not gonna ask you what&rsquo;s inside the fanny pack,</p>
<p>but if you were to design a perfect killing machine</p>
<p>that also wore a fanny pack,</p>
<p>what would you put in that fanny pack?</p>
<p>Would it be something mundane and practical,</p>
<p>or would it be something surprising and hilarious?</p>
<p>Would it be something of philosophical significance,</p>
<p>or maybe sentimental significance,</p>
<p>or would it be empty as a troll on human civilization?</p>
<p>But if it was a perfect killing machine,</p>
<p>it would have to be some kind of weapon.</p>
<p>Put in a fanny pack.</p>
<p>Does it have to be a very compact weapon?</p>
<p>We mentioned offline that there&rsquo;s also things</p>
<p>in the chess world where there is a different kind</p>
<p>of vibrating devices that could be used</p>
<p>to communicate information in communication</p>
<p>with the AI systems that can help you</p>
<p>in your particular pursuit.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think in jiu-jitsu you need,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s possible for a machine to give you information</p>
<p>that gives you advantage.</p>
<p>You can in chess and in poker.</p>
<p>So you could put one of those vibrating devices</p>
<p>in your fanny pack, but in jiu-jitsu it would not help you.</p>
<p>Any idea what kind of weapon?</p>
<p>To fit in a fanny pack?</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re a fan of knives.</p>
<p>Where&rsquo;s the interest in knives come from, by the way?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s more metaphorical.</p>
<p>The truth is that in the modern world,</p>
<p>a knife is not an efficient weapon.</p>
<p>Easily be overwhelmed by firearms.</p>
<p>My fascination with knives comes more in the sense</p>
<p>that they convey a spirit to my students</p>
<p>where a knife is made of steel</p>
<p>and steel begins as ore in the ground.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an ugly, unfinished product,</p>
<p>which through the enactment of knowledge,</p>
<p>time and discipline can be transformed</p>
<p>into beautiful, shining steel.</p>
<p>It can have something which,</p>
<p>it begins as something which has no real function</p>
<p>and becomes one of the most functional</p>
<p>and important tools in all of human history,</p>
<p>without which human civilization</p>
<p>could never have even begun.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s what separated humans and took us</p>
<p>from the bottom of the food chain</p>
<p>and began our gradual rise towards the top</p>
<p>of the food chain.</p>
<p>So it has immense historical and cultural value,</p>
<p>but it has this metaphorical value</p>
<p>insofar as the martial artist begins</p>
<p>as a white belt like iron ore,</p>
<p>but over time transforms into some beautiful,</p>
<p>shining steel, which can have immense value.</p>
<p>In addition, there&rsquo;s a sense of maintenance.</p>
<p>As remarkable as steel is,</p>
<p>it is in need of constant maintenance.</p>
<p>It will fall apart through rust</p>
<p>and neglect will destroy a blade,</p>
<p>both in terms of rust and the edge falling apart.</p>
<p>And so just as the martial artist,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not good enough just to learn the techniques,</p>
<p>you need to maintain them over time.</p>
<p>And just as steel is perishable,</p>
<p>so too are the skills of martial arts.</p>
<p>And that when I give a gift of a knife to a student,</p>
<p>these metaphorical elements start to emerge.</p>
<p>Okay, I began as iron ore</p>
<p>and I want to become the finished blade.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s another sense in which a knife is morally neutral.</p>
<p>A knife can be used to save a life.</p>
<p>It can be used to cook a meal,</p>
<p>but it can also be used for murder</p>
<p>for the worst possible purposes.</p>
<p>Jiu-Jitsu is the same way.</p>
<p>Jiu-Jitsu can make you a better person.</p>
<p>It can make you a worse person.</p>
<p>Jiu-Jitsu is just a power.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a particularly great power, but it is a power.</p>
<p>And like all power, it can be used for both good and bad.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s morally neutral in itself.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s up to us to make sure</p>
<p>that just as the knife gets used</p>
<p>for good purposes rather than bad,</p>
<p>so too that Jiu-Jitsu be used</p>
<p>for good purposes rather than bad.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also an element where the basis of the knife</p>
<p>is steel.</p>
<p>And historically, there&rsquo;s always been a riddle of steel,</p>
<p>which is steel has the property</p>
<p>of both hardness and suppleness.</p>
<p>The harder you make steel,</p>
<p>the better its edge retention becomes.</p>
<p>The longer that edge will stay sharp.</p>
<p>This is good, but it comes at a price.</p>
<p>The harder you make steel, the more brittle it becomes.</p>
<p>And now that edge can be damaged easily.</p>
<p>So the solution is to make the steel softer, more malleable.</p>
<p>That will prevent breakage of the blade</p>
<p>and chipping of the edge.</p>
<p>But when you make the steel softer, that comes at a price.</p>
<p>And that price is now the edge loses</p>
<p>its sharpness very easily.</p>
<p>And so the riddle of steel is how to work</p>
<p>with these two to the greatest degree possible</p>
<p>and create an edge which is hard enough</p>
<p>to stay sharp for long periods of time,</p>
<p>but without making the steel so brittle</p>
<p>that the blade overall is compromised.</p>
<p>So too in Jiu-Jitsu, your task in training</p>
<p>is to make the training competitive enough</p>
<p>that you actually get used to the rigors of real combat.</p>
<p>But on the other hand, it can&rsquo;t be so brutal</p>
<p>that the athletes get broken down in the gym</p>
<p>to a point where they&rsquo;re no longer effective.</p>
<p>And so this duality of hardness and softness,</p>
<p>which we see in the case of blades,</p>
<p>is there in the training of the Jiu-Jitsu athlete.</p>
<p>So I often give a gift of a knife to a student</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;ve done something significant</p>
<p>because it demonstrates in a metaphorical way</p>
<p>these key themes of the sport.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;ve been honored to be a student of yours.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been plagued by injury,</p>
<p>but I hope to one day earn one such knife.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s a really powerful metaphor.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really honored that you would spend any time with me</p>
<p>in any context, but especially on the mat</p>
<p>and especially today in conversation, John,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re an incredible person.</p>
<p>Thank you for everything you do.</p>
<p>Congratulations for historic accomplishment.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always beautiful and inspiring to see greatness.</p>
<p>And what I saw, what we saw at ADCC was greatness,</p>
<p>rare greatness, and it&rsquo;s beautiful to see</p>
<p>that humans can achieve that kind of thing.</p>
<p>So thank you for making that happen.</p>
<p>And thank you for talking today.</p>
<p>Thank you, Lex.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation</p>
<p>with John Donahuer.</p>

<p>And now let me leave you with some words</p>
<p>from Miyamoto Musashi.</p>
<p>The only reason a warrior is alive is to fight.</p>
<p>And the only reason a warrior fights is to win.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.</p>
