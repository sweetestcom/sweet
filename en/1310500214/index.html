    <p>The following is a conversation with Matt Walker,</p>
<p>sleep scientist, professor of neuroscience</p>
<p>and psychology at Berkeley, author of Why We Sleep,</p>
<p>and the host of a new podcast called The Matt Walker Podcast.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s 10 minute episodes a couple of times a month,</p>
<p>covering sleep and other health and science topics.</p>
<p>I love it and recommend it highly.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s up there with the greats,</p>
<p>like the Huberman Lab Podcast with Andrew Huberman,</p>
<p>and I think David Sinclair is putting out</p>
<p>an audio series soon too.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t wait to listen to it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really excited by the future of science</p>
<p>in the podcasting world.</p>
<p>To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors,</p>
<p>Stamps.com, Squarespace, Athletic Greens,</p>
<p>BetterHelp, and Onnit.</p>
<p>Their links are in the description.</p>
<p>As a side note, let me say that to me,</p>
<p>a healthy life is one in which you fall in love</p>
<p>with the world around you, with ideas, with people,</p>
<p>with small goals and big goals, no matter how difficult,</p>
<p>with dreams you hold onto and chase for years.</p>
<p>Life should be lived fully.</p>
<p>That, to me, is the priority.</p>
<p>That, to me, is a healthy life.</p>
<p>Second to that is the understanding and the utilization</p>
<p>of the best available science on diet, exercise,</p>
<p>supplements, sleep, and other lifestyle choices.</p>
<p>To me, science in the realm of health is a guide</p>
<p>for what we should try, not the absolute truth</p>
<p>of how to live life.</p>
<p>The goal is to learn to listen to your body</p>
<p>and figure out what works best for you.</p>
<p>All that said, a good night&rsquo;s sleep can be a great tool</p>
<p>in making life awesome and productive,</p>
<p>and Matt is a great advocate of the how and the why of sleep.</p>
<p>We agree on some things and disagree on others,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s a great human being, a great scientist,</p>
<p>and, as of recently, a friend with whom I enjoy</p>
<p>having these wide ranging conversations.</p>
<p>This is the Lux Friedman podcast,</p>
<p>and here is my conversation with Matt Walker.</p>
<p>You should try these shades on.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see what you look like.</p>
<p>So they are now your shades, and that&rsquo;s not the question.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same thing as Putin took the Super Bowl ring,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s now his ring.</p>
<p>Yeah, one wonders if he was offered it,</p>
<p>but they are yours.</p>
<p>When did you first fall in love with the dream</p>
<p>of understanding sleep?</p>
<p>Like, where did the fascination with sleep begin?</p>
<p>So back in the United Kingdom,</p>
<p>you can sort of start doing medicine at age 18,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a five year program,</p>
<p>and I was at the Queen&rsquo;s Medical Center in the UK,</p>
<p>and I remember just being fascinated</p>
<p>by states of consciousness, and particularly anesthesia.</p>
<p>I was thinking, isn&rsquo;t that, within seconds,</p>
<p>I can take a perfectly conscious human being,</p>
<p>and I can remove all existence of the mentality</p>
<p>and their awareness within seconds,</p>
<p>and that stunned me.</p>
<p>So I started to get really interested in conscious states.</p>
<p>I even started to read a lot about hypnosis,</p>
<p>and all of these things, hypnosis,</p>
<p>even sleep and dreams at the time,</p>
<p>they were very esoteric.</p>
<p>It was sort of charlatan science at that stage,</p>
<p>and I think almost all of my colleagues and I</p>
<p>are accidental sleep researchers.</p>
<p>No one, as I recall, in the classroom</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re sort of five years old,</p>
<p>and the teacher says,</p>
<p>what would you like to be when you grow up?</p>
<p>No one&rsquo;s putting their hand up and saying,</p>
<p>I would love to be a sleep researcher.</p>
<p>And so when I was doing my PhD,</p>
<p>I was trying to identify different forms of dementia</p>
<p>very early on in the course,</p>
<p>and I was using electrical brainwave recordings to do that,</p>
<p>and I was failing miserably.</p>
<p>It was a disaster, just no result after no result.</p>
<p>And I used to go home to the doctor&rsquo;s residence</p>
<p>with this sort of little igloo of journals</p>
<p>that at the weekend I would sort of sit in and read,</p>
<p>and which I&rsquo;m now thinking,</p>
<p>do I really want to admit this?</p>
<p>Because it sounds like I had no social life,</p>
<p>which I didn&rsquo;t, I was a social leper.</p>
<p>But, and I started to realize that some parts of the brain</p>
<p>were sleep related areas,</p>
<p>and some dementias were eating away</p>
<p>those sleep related areas.</p>
<p>Other dementias would leave them untouched.</p>
<p>And I thought, well, I&rsquo;m doing this all wrong.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m measuring my patients while they&rsquo;re awake.</p>
<p>Instead, I should be measuring them while they&rsquo;re asleep.</p>
<p>Started doing that, got some amazing results.</p>
<p>And then I wanted to ask the question,</p>
<p>is that sleep disruption that my patients are experiencing</p>
<p>as they go into dementia,</p>
<p>maybe it&rsquo;s not a symptom of the dementia.</p>
<p>I wonder if it&rsquo;s a cause of the dementia.</p>
<p>And at that point, which was, cough, cough, 20 years ago,</p>
<p>no one could answer a very simple fundamental question.</p>
<p>Why do we sleep?</p>
<p>And I at the time didn&rsquo;t realize</p>
<p>that some of the most brilliant minds in scientific history</p>
<p>had tried to answer that question and failed.</p>
<p>And at that point, I just thought, well,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to go and do a couple of years of sleep research</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll figure out why we sleep.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;ll come back to my patients</p>
<p>in this question of dementia.</p>
<p>And as I said, that was 20 years ago.</p>
<p>And what I realized is that hard questions</p>
<p>care very little about who asks them.</p>
<p>They will meter out their lessons of difficulty</p>
<p>all the same.</p>
<p>And I was schooled in the difficulty of the question,</p>
<p>why do we sleep?</p>
<p>But in truth, 20 years later,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve had to upend the question</p>
<p>rather than saying, why do we sleep?</p>
<p>And by the way, the answer then was</p>
<p>that we sleep to cure sleepiness,</p>
<p>which is like saying, we eat to cure hunger.</p>
<p>That tells you nothing about the physiological benefits</p>
<p>of food, same with sleep.</p>
<p>Now we&rsquo;ve actually have to ask the question,</p>
<p>is there any physiological system in the body</p>
<p>or any major operation of the mind</p>
<p>that isn&rsquo;t wonderfully enhanced when we get sleep</p>
<p>or demonstrably impaired when we don&rsquo;t get enough?</p>
<p>And so far, for the most part, the answer seems to be no.</p>
<p>So far, the answer seems to be no.</p>
<p>So why does the body and the mind crave sleep?</p>
<p>Crave sleep then?</p>
<p>Why do we sleep?</p>
<p>How can we begin to answer that question then?</p>
<p>So I think one of the ways that I think about this</p>
<p>or one of the answers that came to me is the following.</p>
<p>The reason that we implode so quickly</p>
<p>and so thoroughly with insufficient sleep</p>
<p>is because human beings seem to be one of the few species</p>
<p>that will deliberately deprive themselves of sleep</p>
<p>for no apparent good reason, biological.</p>
<p>And what that led me then to was the following.</p>
<p>Mother nature as a consequence.</p>
<p>So no other species does what we do in that context.</p>
<p>There are a few species that do undergo sleep deprivation,</p>
<p>but for very obvious, clear biological reasons.</p>
<p>One is when they&rsquo;re in a condition of severe starvation.</p>
<p>The second is when they&rsquo;re caring for their newborn.</p>
<p>So for example, killer whales will often deprive themselves.</p>
<p>The female will go away from the pod, give birth,</p>
<p>and then bring the calf back.</p>
<p>And during that time,</p>
<p>the mother will undergo sleep deprivation.</p>
<p>And then the third one is during migration</p>
<p>when birds are flying trans oceanographic 2,000, 3,000 miles.</p>
<p>But for the most part,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s never seen in the animal kingdom,</p>
<p>which brings me back to the point,</p>
<p>therefore mother nature in the course of evolution</p>
<p>has never had to face the challenge of this thing</p>
<p>called sleep deprivation.</p>
<p>And therefore she has never created a safety net in place</p>
<p>to circumnavigate this common influence.</p>
<p>And there is a good example where we have,</p>
<p>which is called the adipose cell, the fat cell.</p>
<p>Because during our evolutionary past,</p>
<p>we had famine and we had feast.</p>
<p>And mother nature came up with a very clever recipe,</p>
<p>which is how can I store caloric credit</p>
<p>so that I can spend it when I go into debt?</p>
<p>And the fat cell was born, brilliant idea.</p>
<p>Where is the fat cell for sleep?</p>
<p>Where is that sort of banking chip for sleep?</p>
<p>And unfortunately we don&rsquo;t seem to have one</p>
<p>because she&rsquo;s never had to face that challenge.</p>
<p>So even if there&rsquo;s not some kind of physics,</p>
<p>fundamental need for sleep</p>
<p>that physiologically or psychologically,</p>
<p>the fact is most organisms are built such that they need it.</p>
<p>And then mother nature never built an extra mechanism</p>
<p>for sleep deprivation.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s interesting that why we sleep</p>
<p>might not have a good answer,</p>
<p>but we need to sleep to be healthy is nevertheless true.</p>
<p>Yeah, and we have many answers right now.</p>
<p>In some ways the question of why we sleep</p>
<p>was the wrong question too.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s what are the plory potent many reasons we sleep?</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t just sleep for one reason</p>
<p>because from an evolutionary perspective,</p>
<p>it is the most idiotic thing that you could imagine.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re sleeping, you&rsquo;re not finding a mate,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not reproducing,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not caring for your young,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not foraging for food,</p>
<p>and worse still, you&rsquo;re vulnerable to predation.</p>
<p>So on any one of those grounds,</p>
<p>especially as a collective,</p>
<p>sleep should have been strongly selected against</p>
<p>in the course of evolution.</p>
<p>But in every species that we&rsquo;ve studied carefully to date,</p>
<p>sleep is present.</p>
<p>Yeah, so it is important.</p>
<p>So like you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;ve heard arguments</p>
<p>from an evolutionary biology perspective</p>
<p>that sleep is actually advantageous,</p>
<p>maybe like some kind of predator prey relationships.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re saying,</p>
<p>and it actually makes way more sense what you&rsquo;re saying</p>
<p>is it should have been selected against.</p>
<p>Like why close your eyes?</p>
<p>Yeah, why?</p>
<p>Because there was an energy conservation hypothesis</p>
<p>for a while,</p>
<p>which is that we need to essentially go</p>
<p>into low battery mode, power down,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s unsustainable.</p>
<p>But in fact, that actually has been blasted out the water</p>
<p>because sleep is an incredibly active process.</p>
<p>In fact, the difference between you just lying on the couch</p>
<p>but remaining conscious versus you lying on the couch</p>
<p>and falling asleep,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s only a savings of about 140, 150 calories.</p>
<p>In other words, you just go out</p>
<p>and club another baby seal or whatever it was,</p>
<p>and you wouldn&rsquo;t worry.</p>
<p>So it has to be much more to it than energy conservation,</p>
<p>much more to it than sharing ecosystem space and time,</p>
<p>much more to it than simply predator prey relationships.</p>
<p>If sleep really did,</p>
<p>and looking back,</p>
<p>even very old evolutionary organisms like earthworms,</p>
<p>millions of years old,</p>
<p>they have periods where they&rsquo;re active</p>
<p>and periods where they&rsquo;re passively asleep.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called lethargicus.</p>
<p>And so what that in some ways suggested to me</p>
<p>was sleep evolved with life itself on this planet,</p>
<p>and then it has fought its way through heroically</p>
<p>every step along the evolutionary pathway,</p>
<p>which then leads to the sort of famous sleep statement</p>
<p>from a researcher that if sleep doesn&rsquo;t serve</p>
<p>an absolutely vital function or functions,</p>
<p>then it&rsquo;s the biggest mistake</p>
<p>the evolutionary process has ever made.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve now realized Mother Nature</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t make a spectacular blender with sleep.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve mentioned the idea of conscious states.</p>
<p>Do you think of sleep</p>
<p>as a fundamentally different conscious state than awakeness?</p>
<p>And how many conscious states are there</p>
<p>so when you&rsquo;re into it,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re understanding of what the mind can do,</p>
<p>do you think awake state, sleep state,</p>
<p>or is there some kind of continuum?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a complicated state transition diagram.</p>
<p>Like how do you think about this whole space?</p>
<p>I think about it as a state space diagram.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s probably more of a continuum</p>
<p>than we have believed it to be or suggested it to be.</p>
<p>So we used to think absent of anesthesia</p>
<p>that there were already three main states of consciousness.</p>
<p>There was being awake, being in non rapid eye movement sleep</p>
<p>or non dream sleep,</p>
<p>and then being in rapid eye movement sleep or dream sleep.</p>
<p>And those were the three states</p>
<p>within which your brain could percolate and be conscious.</p>
<p>Conscious during non REM sleep is maybe a stretch to say,</p>
<p>but I still believe there is plenty of consciousness there.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe that though anymore.</p>
<p>And the reason is because we can have daydreams</p>
<p>and we are in a very different wakeful state</p>
<p>in those daydreams than we are when we are as we are now</p>
<p>together present and extra septively focused</p>
<p>rather than intra septively focused.</p>
<p>And then we also know that as you are sort of progressing</p>
<p>into those different stages of sleep during non REM sleep,</p>
<p>you can also still dream,</p>
<p>depends on your definition of dreaming,</p>
<p>but we seem to have some degree of dreaming</p>
<p>in almost all stages of sleep.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve also then found that when you are sleep deprived,</p>
<p>there are even individual brain cells will fall asleep.</p>
<p>Despite the animal being, you know,</p>
<p>behaviorally from best we can tell awake,</p>
<p>individual brain cells and clusters of brain cells</p>
<p>will go into a sleep like state.</p>
<p>And humans do this too.</p>
<p>When we are sleep deprived,</p>
<p>we have what are called microsleeps</p>
<p>where the eyelid will partially close</p>
<p>and the brain essentially falls lapses</p>
<p>into a state of sleep,</p>
<p>but behaviorally you seem to be awake.</p>
<p>And the danger here is road traffic accidents.</p>
<p>So these are the,</p>
<p>what we call these sort of microsleep events at the wheel.</p>
<p>Now, if you&rsquo;re traveling at 65 miles an hour</p>
<p>in a two ton vehicle,</p>
<p>you know, it takes probably around one second</p>
<p>to drift from one lane to the next</p>
<p>and it takes two seconds to go completely off the road.</p>
<p>So if you have one of these microsleeps at the wheel,</p>
<p>you know, it could be the last microsleep</p>
<p>that you ever have.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t now see it as a set of,</p>
<p>you know, very binary distinct,</p>
<p>you know, step function state.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a one or a zero.</p>
<p>I see it more of a, as a continuum.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve for five, six years at MIT</p>
<p>really focused on this human side of driving question.</p>
<p>And one of the big concerns is the microsleeps,</p>
<p>drowsiness, these kinds of ideas.</p>
<p>And one of the open questions was,</p>
<p>is it possible through computer vision to detect</p>
<p>or any kind of sensors?</p>
<p>The nice thing about computer vision</p>
<p>is you don&rsquo;t have to have direct contact to the person.</p>
<p>Is it possible to detect increases in drowsiness?</p>
<p>Is it possible to detect these kinds of microsleeps</p>
<p>or actually just sleep in general?</p>
<p>Among other things, like distraction,</p>
<p>these are all words that have so many meanings</p>
<p>and so many debates, like attention is a whole nother one.</p>
<p>Just because you&rsquo;re looking at something</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t mean you&rsquo;re loading in the information.</p>
<p>Just because you&rsquo;re looking away</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t mean your peripheral vision</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t pick up the important information.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so many complicated vision science things there.</p>
<p>So I wonder if you could say something to,</p>
<p>they say the eyes are the windows to the soul.</p>
<p>Do you think the eyes can reveal</p>
<p>something about sleepiness through computer vision,</p>
<p>just looking at the video of the face?</p>
<p>And Andrew Huberman and I, your friend,</p>
<p>have talked about this.</p>
<p>I would love to work on this together.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a fascinating problem.</p>
<p>But drowsiness is a tricky one.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s, what kind of information?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s blinking and there&rsquo;s eye movement.</p>
<p>And those are the ones that can be picked up</p>
<p>with computer vision.</p>
<p>Do you think those are signals that could be used</p>
<p>to say something about where we are in this continuum?</p>
<p>Yeah, I do.</p>
<p>And I think there are a number of other features too.</p>
<p>I think, you know, aperture of eye.</p>
<p>So in other words, partial closures, full closures,</p>
<p>duration of those closures, duration of those partial</p>
<p>closures of the eyelid.</p>
<p>I think there may be some information in the pupil as well,</p>
<p>because as we&rsquo;re transitioning between those states,</p>
<p>there are changes in what&rsquo;s called</p>
<p>the automatic nervous system,</p>
<p>or technically it&rsquo;s called the autonomic nervous system,</p>
<p>part of which will control your pupillary size.</p>
<p>So I actually think that there is probably</p>
<p>a wealth of information.</p>
<p>When you combine that probably with aspects of steering,</p>
<p>angle steering maneuver.</p>
<p>And if you can sense the pressure on the pedals as well,</p>
<p>my guess is that there is some combinatorial feature</p>
<p>that creates a phenotype of,</p>
<p>you are starting to fall asleep.</p>
<p>And as the autonomous controls develop,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s time for them to kick in.</p>
<p>Some manufacturers, auto manufacturers sort of have</p>
<p>something beta version, maybe an alpha version of this</p>
<p>already starting to come online,</p>
<p>where they have a little camera in the wheel</p>
<p>that I think tries to look at some features.</p>
<p>Almost everybody doing this and it&rsquo;s very alpha.</p>
<p>So, you know, the thing that you currently have,</p>
<p>some people have that in their car,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a coffee cup or something that comes up</p>
<p>that you might be sleepy.</p>
<p>The primary signal that they&rsquo;re comfortable using</p>
<p>is the steering wheel reversals.</p>
<p>So basically using your interaction with the steering wheel</p>
<p>and how much you&rsquo;re interacting with it</p>
<p>as a sign of sleepiness.</p>
<p>So if you have to constantly correct the car,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a sign of like you starting to drift</p>
<p>into microsleep.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a very, very crude signal.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably a powerful one.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a whole nother component to this,</p>
<p>which is it seems like it&rsquo;s so driver and subject dependent.</p>
<p>How our behavior changes as we get sleepy and drowsy</p>
<p>seems to be different in complicated, fascinating ways</p>
<p>where you can&rsquo;t just use one signal.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of like what you&rsquo;re saying,</p>
<p>there has to be a lot of different signals</p>
<p>that you should then be able to combine.</p>
<p>The hope is there&rsquo;s the searches for like universal signals</p>
<p>that are pretty damn good for like 90% of people.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t think we need</p>
<p>to take necessarily quite that approach.</p>
<p>I think what we could do in some clever fashion</p>
<p>is using the individual.</p>
<p>So what you and I are perhaps suggesting here</p>
<p>is that there is an array of features</p>
<p>that we know provide information</p>
<p>that is sensitive to whether or not</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re falling asleep at the wheel.</p>
<p>Some of those, let&rsquo;s say that there are 10 of them,</p>
<p>for me, seven of them are the cardinal features.</p>
<p>For you, however, you know, six of them</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re not all the same sort of overlapping</p>
<p>are those for you.</p>
<p>I think what we need is algorithms</p>
<p>that can firstly understand when you are well slept.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s say that people have sleep trackers at night</p>
<p>and then your car integrates that information</p>
<p>and it understands when you are well slept.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;ve got the data of the individual behavior</p>
<p>unique to that individual, snowflake like,</p>
<p>when they are well slept.</p>
<p>This is the signature of well rested driving.</p>
<p>Then you can look at deviations from that</p>
<p>and pattern match it with the sleep history</p>
<p>of that individual.</p>
<p>And then I don&rsquo;t need to find the sort of, you know,</p>
<p>the one size fits all approach for 99% of the people.</p>
<p>I can create a very bespoke tailor like set of features,</p>
<p>a Savile Row suit of sleepiness features.</p>
<p>You know, that would be my,</p>
<p>if you want to ask me about moon shots and crazy ideas,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s where I go.</p>
<p>But to start with, I think your approach is a great one.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s find something that covers 99% of the people</p>
<p>because the worrying thing about microsleeps of course,</p>
<p>unlike, you know, drugs or alcohol, which you know,</p>
<p>certainly is a terrible thing to be behind the wheel.</p>
<p>With those often you react too late.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the reason you get into an accident.</p>
<p>When you fall asleep behind the wheel,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t react at all.</p>
<p>You know, at that point,</p>
<p>there is a two ton missile driving down the street</p>
<p>and no one&rsquo;s in control.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why those accidents can often be more dangerous.</p>
<p>Yeah, and the fascinating thing is,</p>
<p>in the case of semi autonomous vehicles,</p>
<p>like Tesla autopilot,</p>
<p>this is where I&rsquo;ve had disagreements with Mr. Elon Musk,</p>
<p>and the human factors community,</p>
<p>which is this community that one of the big things they study</p>
<p>is human supervision over automation.</p>
<p>So you have like pilots, you know, supervising an airplane</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s mostly flying autonomously.</p>
<p>The question is, when we&rsquo;re actually doing the driving,</p>
<p>how do microsleeps or general,</p>
<p>how does drowsiness progress</p>
<p>and how does it affect our driving?</p>
<p>That question becomes more fascinating, more complicated</p>
<p>when your task is not driving,</p>
<p>but supervising the driving.</p>
<p>So your task is to take over when stuff goes wrong.</p>
<p>And that is complicated,</p>
<p>but the basic conclusions from many decades</p>
<p>is that humans are really crappy at supervising</p>
<p>because they get drowsy and lose vigilance much, much faster.</p>
<p>The really surprising thing with Tesla autopilot,</p>
<p>it was surprising to me,</p>
<p>surprising to the human factors community,</p>
<p>and in fact, they still argue with me about it,</p>
<p>is it seems that humans in Teslas with autopilot</p>
<p>and other similar systems are not becoming less vigilant,</p>
<p>at least with the studies we&rsquo;ve done.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s something about the urgency of driving.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;m not sure why,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s something about the risk,</p>
<p>I think the fact that you might die</p>
<p>is still keeping people awake.</p>
<p>The question is, as Tesla autopilot</p>
<p>or similar systems get better and better and better,</p>
<p>how does that affect increasing drowsiness?</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s when you need to have,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s where the big disagreement was,</p>
<p>you need to have driver sensing,</p>
<p>meaning driver facing camera</p>
<p>that tracks some kind of information about the face</p>
<p>that can tell you drowsiness.</p>
<p>So you can tell the car if you&rsquo;re drowsy</p>
<p>so that the car can be like,</p>
<p>you should be probably driving or pull to the side.</p>
<p>Right, or I need to do some of the heavy lifting here.</p>
<p>Yeah, so there needs to be that dance of interaction</p>
<p>of a human and machine,</p>
<p>but currently it&rsquo;s mostly steering wheel based.</p>
<p>So this idea that your hands should be</p>
<p>on the steering wheel,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a sign that you&rsquo;re paying attention</p>
<p>is an outdated and a very crude metric.</p>
<p>I agree, yeah.</p>
<p>I think there are far more sophisticated ways</p>
<p>that we can solve that problem if we invest.</p>
<p>Can I ask you a big philosophical question</p>
<p>before we get into fun details?</p>
<p>On the topic of conscious states,</p>
<p>how fundamental do you think is consciousness</p>
<p>to the human mind?</p>
<p>I ask this from almost like a robotics perspective.</p>
<p>So in your study of sleep,</p>
<p>do you think the hard question of consciousness</p>
<p>that it feels like something to be us,</p>
<p>is that like a nice little feature,</p>
<p>like a quirk of our mind,</p>
<p>or is it somehow fundamental?</p>
<p>Because sleep feels like we take a step out</p>
<p>of that consciousness a little bit.</p>
<p>So from all your study of sleep,</p>
<p>do you think consciousness is like deeply part of who we are</p>
<p>or is it just a nice trick?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a deeply embedded feature</p>
<p>that I can imagine has a whole panoply</p>
<p>of biological benefits.</p>
<p>But to your point about sleep,</p>
<p>what is interesting if you do a lot of dream research</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ve done some,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very, very rare at all, in fact,</p>
<p>for you to end up becoming someone</p>
<p>other than who you are in your dreams.</p>
<p>Now you can have third person perspective dreams</p>
<p>where you can see yourself in the dream</p>
<p>as if you&rsquo;re sort of,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve risen above your physical being.</p>
<p>But for the most part,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very rare that we lose our sense of conscious self.</p>
<p>And maybe I&rsquo;m sort of doing a sleight of hand</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s really what I&rsquo;m saying,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very rare that we lose our sense</p>
<p>of who we are in dreams.</p>
<p>We never do.</p>
<p>Now that&rsquo;s not to suggest that dreams aren&rsquo;t utterly bizarre.</p>
<p>And I mean, when you slept last night,</p>
<p>which I know may have been perhaps a little less than me,</p>
<p>but when you went into dreaming,</p>
<p>you became flagrantly psychotic.</p>
<p>And there are five essentially good reasons.</p>
<p>Firstly, you started to see things which were not there,</p>
<p>so you were hallucinating.</p>
<p>Second, you believe things that couldn&rsquo;t possibly be true,</p>
<p>so you were delusional.</p>
<p>Third, you became confused about time and place and person,</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re suffering from what we would call disorientation.</p>
<p>Fourth, you have wildly fluctuating emotions,</p>
<p>something that psychiatrists</p>
<p>will call being affectively labile.</p>
<p>And then how wonderful, you woke up this morning</p>
<p>and you forgot most if not all of that dream experience,</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re suffering from amnesia.</p>
<p>If you were to experience any one of those five things</p>
<p>while you&rsquo;re awake,</p>
<p>you would probably be seeking psychological help.</p>
<p>But so I place that as a backdrop</p>
<p>against your astute question,</p>
<p>because despite all of that psychosis,</p>
<p>there is still a present self nested at the heart of it,</p>
<p>meaning that I think it&rsquo;s very difficult for us</p>
<p>to abandon our conscious sense of self.</p>
<p>And if it&rsquo;s that hard,</p>
<p>the old adage in some ways,</p>
<p>that you can&rsquo;t outrun your shadow.</p>
<p>But here it&rsquo;s more of a philosophical question,</p>
<p>which is about the conscious mind</p>
<p>and what the state of consciousness actually means</p>
<p>in a human being.</p>
<p>So I think that that to me,</p>
<p>you become so dislocated from so many other rational ways</p>
<p>of waking consciousness.</p>
<p>But one thing that won&rsquo;t go away,</p>
<p>that won&rsquo;t get perturbed or sort of, you know,</p>
<p>manacled, is this your sense of conscious self?</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s a strong sign that consciousness</p>
<p>is fundamental to the human mind.</p>
<p>Or we&rsquo;re just creatures of habit</p>
<p>who gotten used to having consciousness.</p>
<p>Maybe it just takes a lot of either chemical substances</p>
<p>or a lot of like mental work to escape that.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s like trying to launch a rocket.</p>
<p>You know, the energy that has to be put in</p>
<p>to create escape velocity</p>
<p>from the gravitational pull of this thing</p>
<p>called planet earth is immense.</p>
<p>Well, the same thing is true</p>
<p>for us to abandon our sense of conscious self.</p>
<p>The amount of biological, the amount of substances,</p>
<p>the amount of wacky stuff that you have to do</p>
<p>to truly get escape velocity from your conscious self.</p>
<p>What does that tell us about then</p>
<p>the fundamental state of our conscious self?</p>
<p>Yeah, it also probably says that it&rsquo;s quite useful</p>
<p>to have consciousness for survival</p>
<p>and for just operation in this world.</p>
<p>And perhaps for intelligence.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m one of the, on the AI side,</p>
<p>people that think that intelligence requires consciousness.</p>
<p>So like high levels of general intelligence</p>
<p>requires consciousness.</p>
<p>Most people in the AI field think like consciousness</p>
<p>and intelligence are fundamentally different.</p>
<p>You could build a computer that&rsquo;s super intelligent.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t have to be conscious.</p>
<p>I think that if you define super intelligence</p>
<p>by being good at chess, yes.</p>
<p>But if you define super intelligence</p>
<p>as being able to operate in this living world of humans</p>
<p>and be able to perform all kinds of different tasks,</p>
<p>consciousness, it seems to be somehow fundamental</p>
<p>to richly integrate yourself into the human experience,</p>
<p>into society.</p>
<p>It feels like you have to be a conscious being.</p>
<p>But then we don&rsquo;t even know what consciousness is</p>
<p>and we certainly don&rsquo;t know how to engineer it</p>
<p>in our machines.</p>
<p>I love the fact that there are still questions</p>
<p>that are so embryonic because, you know,</p>
<p>I suspect it&rsquo;s the same with you.</p>
<p>Answers to me are simply ways to get to more questions.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s questions where, you know,</p>
<p>questions turn me on, answers less so.</p>
<p>And I love the fact that we are still embryonic</p>
<p>in our sense of arguing about</p>
<p>even what the definition of consciousness is.</p>
<p>But I also find it fascinating.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s thoroughly delightful</p>
<p>to absorb yourself in the thought.</p>
<p>Think about the brain and we can move back</p>
<p>across the complexity of phylogeny</p>
<p>from, you know, humans to mammals</p>
<p>to sort of birds to reptiles, amphibians, fish.</p>
<p>You can, bacteria, whatever you want.</p>
<p>And you can go through this and say, okay,</p>
<p>where is the hard line of, you know,</p>
<p>what we would define as consciousness?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s got something to do</p>
<p>with the complexity of the neural system.</p>
<p>Of that, I&rsquo;m fairly certain.</p>
<p>But to me, it&rsquo;s always been fascinating.</p>
<p>So what is it then?</p>
<p>You know, is it that I just keep adding neurons</p>
<p>to a Petri dish and I just keep adding them</p>
<p>and adding them and adding them.</p>
<p>At some point when I hit a critical mass</p>
<p>of interconnected neurons, that is the mass of the,</p>
<p>you know, the interconnected human brain, then bingo.</p>
<p>All of a sudden it kicks into gear</p>
<p>and we have consciousness.</p>
<p>Like a phase shift, phase transition of some kind.</p>
<p>Correct, yeah.</p>
<p>But there is something about the complexity</p>
<p>of the nervous system that I think</p>
<p>is fundamental to consciousness.</p>
<p>And the reason I bring that up is because</p>
<p>when we&rsquo;re trying to then think about creating it</p>
<p>in an artificial way, does that inform us</p>
<p>as to the complexity that we should be looking at</p>
<p>in terms of development?</p>
<p>I also think that it&rsquo;s a missed opportunity</p>
<p>in the sort of digital space for us</p>
<p>to try to recreate human consciousness.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve already got human consciousness.</p>
<p>What if we were to think about creating</p>
<p>some other form of, why do we have to think</p>
<p>that the ultimate in the creation of, you know,</p>
<p>an artificial intelligence is the replication,</p>
<p>you know, of a human state of consciousness?</p>
<p>Can we not think outside of our own consciousness</p>
<p>and believe that there is something even more incredible</p>
<p>or more complimentary, more orthogonal?</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m sometimes perplexed that people</p>
<p>are trying to mimic human consciousness</p>
<p>rather than think about creating</p>
<p>something that&rsquo;s different.</p>
<p>I think of human consciousness or consciousness in general</p>
<p>as this magic superpower that allows us</p>
<p>to deeply experience the world.</p>
<p>And just as you&rsquo;re saying, I don&rsquo;t think that superpower</p>
<p>has to take the exact flavor as humans have.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my love for robots.</p>
<p>I would love to add the ability to robots</p>
<p>that can experience the world and other humans deeply.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m humbled by the fact that that idea</p>
<p>does not necessarily need to look anything like</p>
<p>how humans experience the world.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a dance of human to robot connection</p>
<p>the same way human to dog or human to cat connection,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a magic there to that interaction.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not sure how to create that magic,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a worthy effort.</p>
<p>I also love, just exactly as you said,</p>
<p>on the question of consciousness</p>
<p>or engineering consciousness,</p>
<p>the fun thing about this problem</p>
<p>is it seems obvious to me that a hundred years from now,</p>
<p>no matter what we do today,</p>
<p>people, if we&rsquo;re still here,</p>
<p>will laugh at how silly our notions were.</p>
<p>So like, it&rsquo;s almost impossible for me to imagine</p>
<p>that we will truly solve this problem fully in my lifetime.</p>
<p>And more than that,</p>
<p>everything we&rsquo;ll do will be silly a hundred years from now,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s still, that makes it fun to me</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s like you have the full freedom</p>
<p>to not even be right, just to try.</p>
<p>Just to try is freedom.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s how I see that.</p>
<p>Get me that T shirt, please.</p>
<p>I love that.</p>
<p>So, and human robot interaction is fascinating</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s like watching dancing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been dancing tango recently</p>
<p>and just, it&rsquo;s like, there is no goal.</p>
<p>The goal is to create something magical</p>
<p>and whether consciousness or emotion</p>
<p>or elegance of movement,</p>
<p>all of those things aid in the creation of the magic.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a free, it&rsquo;s an art form to explore</p>
<p>how to make that, how to create that</p>
<p>in a way that&rsquo;s compelling.</p>
<p>Yeah, I love the line in Sense of a Woman with Al Pacino</p>
<p>where he&rsquo;s speaking about the tango</p>
<p>and he said, really, it&rsquo;s just freedom</p>
<p>that if you get tangled up, you just keep tangoing on.</p>
<p>I still, to this day, I think first or second time</p>
<p>I talked to Joe Rogan on his podcast,</p>
<p>I said, we got into this heated argument</p>
<p>about whether Sense of a Woman</p>
<p>is a better movie than John Wick.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s one of my favorite movies for many reasons.</p>
<p>One is Sense of a Woman.</p>
<p>Partially.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know that, by the way.</p>
<p>I was just gonna.</p>
<p>You just.</p>
<p>Yeah, I didn&rsquo;t know if you would actually know</p>
<p>of the movie.</p>
<p>Awesome, awesome.</p>
<p>No, yeah, I said, I love the tango scene.</p>
<p>I love Al Pacino&rsquo;s performance.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a wonderful movie.</p>
<p>Then Joe was saying, John Wick is better.</p>
<p>So we, to this day, argue about this.</p>
<p>I think it depends on what conscious state you&rsquo;re in</p>
<p>that you would be ready and receptive to.</p>
<p>But Sense of a Woman, I think it has one of the best</p>
<p>monologues at the end of the movie</p>
<p>that has ever been written or at least performed.</p>
<p>When Al Pacino defends the younger.</p>
<p>Yeah, I often think about that.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s been times in my life, I don&rsquo;t know about you,</p>
<p>where I wish I had an Al Pacino in my life,</p>
<p>where integrity is really important in this life.</p>
<p>It is.</p>
<p>And sometimes you find yourself in places</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s pressure to sacrifice that integrity.</p>
<p>And you want, what is it, Lieutenant Colonel</p>
<p>or whatever he was.</p>
<p>To come in.</p>
<p>Slate.</p>
<p>To come in on your side and scream at everyone</p>
<p>and say, what the hell are we doing here?</p>
<p>Being, you know, unfortunately British</p>
<p>and sort of having that slightly awkward</p>
<p>sort of Hugh Grant gene.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very, very, very at the opposite end of the spectrum</p>
<p>of the remarkable feat of Al Pacino</p>
<p>at the end of that scene.</p>
<p>But, and yeah, integrity is, it&rsquo;s a challenging thing</p>
<p>and I value it much.</p>
<p>And I think it can take 20 years to build a reputation</p>
<p>and two minutes to lose it.</p>
<p>And there is nothing more that I value than that integrity</p>
<p>and, you know, if I&rsquo;m ever wrong about anything,</p>
<p>I truly don&rsquo;t want to be wrong for any longer</p>
<p>than I have to be.</p>
<p>You know, that&rsquo;s what being in some ways a scientist is.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just driven by truth.</p>
<p>And the irony relative to something like mathematics</p>
<p>is that in science, you never find truth.</p>
<p>What you do in science is you discount the things</p>
<p>that are likely to be untrue,</p>
<p>leaving only the possibility of what could be true.</p>
<p>But in math, you know, when you create, you know, a proof,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a proof for, you know, from that point forward,</p>
<p>there is truth in mathematics.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s, I think there&rsquo;s a beauty in that,</p>
<p>but I kind of like the messiness of science</p>
<p>because again, to me, it&rsquo;s less about the truth</p>
<p>of the answer and it is more about the pursuit of questions.</p>
<p>But their integrity becomes more and more important</p>
<p>and it becomes more difficult.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of pressures,</p>
<p>just like in the rest of the world,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a lot of pressures than a scientist.</p>
<p>One is like funding sources.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve noticed this, that, you know,</p>
<p>money affects everyone&rsquo;s mind, I think.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been always somebody that I believe money can&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t buy my opinion.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care how much money, billions or trillions.</p>
<p>But that pressure is there and you have to be</p>
<p>very cognizant of it and make sure that your opinion</p>
<p>is not defined by the funding sources.</p>
<p>And then the other is just your own success of, you know,</p>
<p>for a couple of decades, publishing an idea</p>
<p>and then realizing at some point</p>
<p>that that idea was wrong all along.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a tough thing for people to do,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s also integrity is to walk away,</p>
<p>is to say that you were wrong.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t have to be in some big dramatic way.</p>
<p>It could be in a bunch of tiny ways along the way.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Like reconfigure your intuition about a particular problem.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, and all of that is integrity.</p>
<p>When everybody in the room, you know,</p>
<p>believes a certain thing,</p>
<p>everybody in the community believes a certain thing,</p>
<p>to be able to still be open minded in the face of that.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I think it comes down in some ways</p>
<p>to the issue of ego that you bond your correctness</p>
<p>or your rightness, your scientific theory</p>
<p>with your sense of ego.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;ve never found it that difficult to let go</p>
<p>of theories in the face of counter evidence</p>
<p>in part because I have such low self esteem.</p>
<p>Well, I kind of liked that.</p>
<p>I always liked that combination.</p>
<p>I have the same, I&rsquo;m like very self critical,</p>
<p>imposter syndrome, all those things,</p>
<p>putting yourself below the podium,</p>
<p>but at the same time having the ego</p>
<p>that drives the ambition to work your ass off.</p>
<p>Like some kind of weird drive,</p>
<p>maybe like drive to be better.</p>
<p>Like thinking of yourself as not that great</p>
<p>and always driving to be better.</p>
<p>And then at the same time,</p>
<p>because that can be paralyzing and exhausting and so on,</p>
<p>at the same time, just being grateful to be alive.</p>
<p>But in the sciences, in the actual effort,</p>
<p>never be satisfied, never think of yourself highly.</p>
<p>It seems to be a nice combination.</p>
<p>I very much hope that that is part of who I am</p>
<p>and I remain very quietly motivated and driven.</p>
<p>And I, like you, love the idea of perfection</p>
<p>and I know I will never achieve it,</p>
<p>but I will never stop trying to.</p>
<p>So similar to you, which sounds weird</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s all these videos of me on the internet.</p>
<p>So I think I just naturally lean into the things</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m afraid of and I&rsquo;m uncomfortable doing.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m very afraid of talking to people</p>
<p>and just even before talking to you today,</p>
<p>just a lot of anxiety and all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>About talking to me?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Oh, I like.</p>
<p>Nervousness.</p>
<p>Fear in some cases, self doubt and all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>But I do it anyway.</p>
<p>So the reason I bring that up</p>
<p>is you&rsquo;ve launched a podcast.</p>
<p>I have.</p>
<p>Allow me to say, I think you&rsquo;re a great science communicator.</p>
<p>So this challenge of being afraid</p>
<p>or cautious of being in the public eye</p>
<p>and yet having a longing to communicate</p>
<p>some of the things you&rsquo;re excited about</p>
<p>in the space of sleep and beyond.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your vision with this project?</p>
<p>I think firstly to that question, like you,</p>
<p>I am always more afraid of not trying than trying.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>That to me frightens me more.</p>
<p>But with the podcast,</p>
<p>I think really I have two very simple goals.</p>
<p>I want to try and democratize the science of sleep</p>
<p>and in doing so,</p>
<p>my goal would be to try and reunite humanity</p>
<p>with the sleep that it is so desperately bereft of.</p>
<p>And if I can do that through a number of different means,</p>
<p>the podcast is a little bit different than this format.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be short form monologues from yours truly</p>
<p>that will last usually less than just 10 minutes.</p>
<p>And I see it as simply a little slice of sleep goodness</p>
<p>that can accompany your waking day.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to know what is the right way</p>
<p>to do science communication.</p>
<p>Like your friend, mine, Andrew Huberman,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s an incredible human being.</p>
<p>Oh gosh.</p>
<p>So he does like two hours of,</p>
<p>I wonder how many takes he does.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, but it looks like he doesn&rsquo;t do any.</p>
<p>Yeah, I suspect he&rsquo;s that magnificent of a human being.</p>
<p>When I talk to him in like in person,</p>
<p>he always generates intelligent words,</p>
<p>well cited, nonstop for hours.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a Gatling gun of information and it&rsquo;s pristine.</p>
<p>And passion and all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s an interesting medium.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t have,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s funny because I wouldn&rsquo;t have done it</p>
<p>the way he&rsquo;s doing it.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t advise him to do it the way he&rsquo;s doing it.</p>
<p>Cause I thought there&rsquo;s no way you could do</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>Cause it&rsquo;s a lot of work,</p>
<p>but he is like doing an incredible job of it.</p>
<p>I just think it&rsquo;s the same with like Dan Carlin</p>
<p>and hardcore history.</p>
<p>I thought that the way Andrew&rsquo;s doing it</p>
<p>would crush him the way it crushes Dan Carlin.</p>
<p>So Dan has so much pressure on him to do a good job</p>
<p>that he ends up publishing like two episodes a year.</p>
<p>So that pressure can be paralyzing.</p>
<p>The pressure of like putting out like</p>
<p>strong scientific statements</p>
<p>that can be overwhelming.</p>
<p>Now, Andrew seems to be just plowing through anyway.</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s mistakes, he&rsquo;ll say there&rsquo;s corrections and so on.</p>
<p>I just, I wonder,</p>
<p>I actually haven&rsquo;t talked to him too much about it.</p>
<p>Like psychologically, how difficult is it</p>
<p>to put yourself out there for an hour to a week</p>
<p>of just nonstop dropping knowledge.</p>
<p>Any one sentence of which could be totally wrong.</p>
<p>It could be a mistake.</p>
<p>And there will be mistakes.</p>
<p>And I, in the first edition of my book,</p>
<p>there were errors that we corrected</p>
<p>in the second edition too.</p>
<p>But there will be probabilistically,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;ve got 10 facts per page of a book</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve got 350 pages,</p>
<p>odds are it&rsquo;s probably not going to be</p>
<p>utter perfection out the gate.</p>
<p>And it will be the same way for Andrew too.</p>
<p>But having the reverence of</p>
<p>a humble mind</p>
<p>and simply accepting the things that are wrong</p>
<p>and correcting them and doing the right thing.</p>
<p>I know that that&rsquo;s his mentality.</p>
<p>I do want to say that I&rsquo;m just kind of honored to be,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a cool group of like scientific people</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m fortunate enough to now be interacting with.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s you and Andrew and David Sinclair</p>
<p>has been thinking about throwing his hat in the ring.</p>
<p>Oh, I hope so.</p>
<p>David is another one of those very special people</p>
<p>in the world.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s cool because podcasts are, it&rsquo;s cool.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s such a powerful medium of communication.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s much freer than more constrained</p>
<p>like publications and so on.</p>
<p>Or it&rsquo;s much more accessible and inspiring than like,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, conference presentations or lectures.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s a really exciting medium to me.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s cool that there&rsquo;s this like group of people</p>
<p>that are becoming friends and putting stuff out there</p>
<p>and supporting each other.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s fun to also watch how that&rsquo;s going to evolve</p>
<p>in your case, because I wonder it&rsquo;ll be two a month.</p>
<p>Or devolve is the answer to that.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, some of it is persistence</p>
<p>through the challenges that we&rsquo;ve been talking about,</p>
<p>which is like.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;ve got a lot to learn.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But I will persist.</p>
<p>Can I ask you some detailed stuff?</p>
<p>You mentioned that.</p>
<p>Oh my goodness, go anywhere you wish with sleep.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m a big fan of coffee and caffeine.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve been, especially in the last few days,</p>
<p>consuming a very large amount.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m cognizant of the fact that my body is affected</p>
<p>by caffeine different than the anecdotal information</p>
<p>that other people tell me.</p>
<p>I seem to be not at all affected by it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost, it feels like more like a ritual</p>
<p>than it is a chemical boost to my performance.</p>
<p>Like I can drink several cups of coffee right before bed</p>
<p>and just knock out anyway.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if it&rsquo;s a biological chemical</p>
<p>or it has to do with just the fact</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m consuming huge amounts of caffeine.</p>
<p>All that to say, what do you think is the relationship</p>
<p>between coffee and sleep, caffeine and sleep?</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s an interesting distinction there.</p>
<p>There is a distinction.</p>
<p>So I think the first thing to say,</p>
<p>which is going to sound strange coming from me</p>
<p>is drink coffee.</p>
<p>The health benefits associated with drinking coffee</p>
<p>are really quite well established now.</p>
<p>But I think that the counterpoint to that,</p>
<p>well, firstly, the dose and the timing make the poison.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll perhaps come back to that in just a second.</p>
<p>But for coffee, it&rsquo;s actually not the caffeine.</p>
<p>So, a lot of people have asked me</p>
<p>about this rightful paradox between the fact</p>
<p>that sleep provides all of these incredible health benefits</p>
<p>and then coffee, which can have a deleterious impact</p>
<p>on your sleep has a whole collection of health benefits.</p>
<p>Many of them Venn diagram overlapping</p>
<p>with those that sleep provides.</p>
<p>How on earth can you reconcile those two?</p>
<p>And the answer is that, well, the answer is very simple.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called antioxidants, that it turns out</p>
<p>that for most people in Western civilization</p>
<p>because of diet, not being quite what it should be,</p>
<p>the major source through which they obtain antioxidants</p>
<p>is the coffee bean.</p>
<p>So the humble coffee bean has now been asked</p>
<p>to carry the astronomical weight of serving up</p>
<p>the large majority of people&rsquo;s antioxidant needs.</p>
<p>And you can see this if, for example,</p>
<p>you look at the health benefits of decaffeinated coffee,</p>
<p>it has a whole constellation</p>
<p>of really great health benefits too.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not the caffeine.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why I liked what you said,</p>
<p>this sort of separation of church and state</p>
<p>between coffee and caffeine.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the caffeine, it&rsquo;s the coffee bean itself</p>
<p>that provides those health benefits.</p>
<p>But coming back to how it impacts sleep,</p>
<p>it impacts sleep in probably at least three different ways.</p>
<p>The first is that for most people,</p>
<p>caffeine can make it obviously a little harder</p>
<p>to fall asleep.</p>
<p>Caffeine can make it harder to stay asleep.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s say that you are one of those individuals</p>
<p>and I think you are, and you can say,</p>
<p>look, I can have three or four espressos with dinner</p>
<p>and I fall asleep just fine</p>
<p>and I stay asleep soundly across the night.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s no problem.</p>
<p>The downside there is that even if that is true,</p>
<p>the amount of deep sleep that you get will not be as deep.</p>
<p>And so you will actually lose somewhere</p>
<p>between 10 to 30% of your deep sleep</p>
<p>if you drink caffeine in the evening.</p>
<p>So to give you some context,</p>
<p>to drop your deep sleep by let&rsquo;s say 20%,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d probably have to age you by 15 years,</p>
<p>or you could do it every night with a cup of coffee.</p>
<p>I think the fourth component</p>
<p>that is perhaps less well understood about coffee</p>
<p>is its timing, and that&rsquo;s why I was saying</p>
<p>the timing and the dose make the poison.</p>
<p>The dose, by the way,</p>
<p>once you get past about three cups of coffee a day,</p>
<p>the health benefits actually start to turn down</p>
<p>in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>So there is a U shape function.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sort of the Goldilocks syndrome,</p>
<p>not too little, not too much, just the right amount.</p>
<p>The second component is the timing though.</p>
<p>Caffeine has half life of about five to six hours,</p>
<p>meaning that after five to six hours,</p>
<p>50% of that on average for the average adult</p>
<p>is still in the system,</p>
<p>which means that it has a quarter life of 10 to 12 hours.</p>
<p>So in other words, if you have a coffee at noon,</p>
<p>a quarter of that caffeine is still circulating</p>
<p>in your brain at midnight.</p>
<p>So having a cup of coffee at noon,</p>
<p>one could argue is the equivalent</p>
<p>of tucking yourself into bed at midnight,</p>
<p>and before you turn the light out,</p>
<p>you swig a quarter of a cup of coffee.</p>
<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t still answer your question</p>
<p>as to why are you so immune?</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m someone who is actually unfortunately</p>
<p>very sensitive to caffeine.</p>
<p>And if I have even two cups of coffee in the morning,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t sleep as well that night.</p>
<p>And I find it miserable because I love the smell of coffee.</p>
<p>I love the routine.</p>
<p>I love the ritual.</p>
<p>I think I would love to be invested in it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just terrible for my sleep.</p>
<p>So I switched to decaf.</p>
<p>There is a difference from one individual to the next,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s controlled by a set of liver enzymes</p>
<p>called cytochrome P450 enzymes.</p>
<p>And there is a particular gene</p>
<p>that if you have a different sort of version of this gene,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s called CYP1A2.</p>
<p>That gene will determine the speed</p>
<p>of the clearance of caffeine from your system.</p>
<p>Some people will have a version of that gene</p>
<p>that is very effective and efficient</p>
<p>at clearing that caffeine.</p>
<p>And so their half life could be as short as two hours</p>
<p>rather than five to six hours.</p>
<p>Other people, hands up Matt Walker,</p>
<p>have a version of that gene</p>
<p>that is not very effective at clearing out the caffeine.</p>
<p>And therefore their half life sort of sensitivity</p>
<p>could be somewhere between eight to nine hours.</p>
<p>So we understand that there are individual differences,</p>
<p>but overall, I guess the top line here is drink coffee</p>
<p>and understand that it&rsquo;s not the caffeine,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the coffee that&rsquo;s the benefit</p>
<p>and the dose makes the poison.</p>
<p>Is there some aspect to it that it&rsquo;s like a muscle</p>
<p>in terms of all the combination of letters and numbers</p>
<p>that you just said?</p>
<p>Is there some aspect that if I can improve</p>
<p>the quarter life, the half life,</p>
<p>could decrease that number if I just practice?</p>
<p>Like I drink a lot of coffee,</p>
<p>so like habit alters how your body&rsquo;s able</p>
<p>to get rid of the caffeine.</p>
<p>Not how the body is able to get rid of the caffeine,</p>
<p>but it does alter how sensitive the body is to the caffeine.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not at the level of the enzyme</p>
<p>degrading the caffeine.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s at the level of the receptors</p>
<p>that caffeine will act upon.</p>
<p>Now it turns out that those are called adenosine receptors</p>
<p>and maybe we can speak about what adenosine is</p>
<p>and sleep pressure and all of that good stuff.</p>
<p>But as you start to drink more and more coffee,</p>
<p>the body tries to fight back</p>
<p>and it happens with many different drugs by the way,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s called tolerance.</p>
<p>And so one of the ways that your body becomes tolerant</p>
<p>to a drug is that the receptors that the drug is binding to,</p>
<p>these sort of welcome sites, these sort of picture myths,</p>
<p>as it were, that receive the drug,</p>
<p>those start to get taken away from the surface of the cell</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s what we call receptor internalization.</p>
<p>So the cell starts to think, gee whiz,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot of stimulation going on, this is too much.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m just going to, when normally I would coat my cell</p>
<p>with let&rsquo;s just say five of these receptors</p>
<p>for argument&rsquo;s sake,</p>
<p>things are going a little bit too ballistic right now.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to take away at least two of those receptors</p>
<p>and downscale it to just having three of those.</p>
<p>And now you need two cups of coffee to get the same effect</p>
<p>that one cup of coffee got you before.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why then when you go cold turkey on coffee,</p>
<p>all of a sudden the system has equilibrated itself</p>
<p>to expecting X amount of stimulation</p>
<p>and now all of that stimulation is gone.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s now got too few receptors</p>
<p>and you have a caffeine withdrawal syndrome.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why, for example, with drugs of abuse,</p>
<p>things like heroin, when people go into abstinence,</p>
<p>as they&rsquo;re sort of moving into their addiction,</p>
<p>they will build up a progressive tolerance to that drug.</p>
<p>So they need to take more of it to get the same high.</p>
<p>But then if they go cold turkey for some period of time,</p>
<p>the system goes back to being more sensitive again.</p>
<p>It starts to repopulate the surface of the cell</p>
<p>with these receptors.</p>
<p>But now when they reuse and they fall off the wagon,</p>
<p>if they go back to the same dose</p>
<p>that they were using before 10 weeks ago</p>
<p>or three months ago, that dose can kill them.</p>
<p>They can have an overdose.</p>
<p>Even though they were using the same amount</p>
<p>at those two different times,</p>
<p>the difference is that it&rsquo;s not the dose of the drug,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the sensitivity of the system.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the same thing that we see with caffeine.</p>
<p>In terms of training the muscle, as it were,</p>
<p>the system becomes less sensitive, can calibrate.</p>
<p>Is there a time, the number of hours before bed,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a safe bet to most people to recommend</p>
<p>you shouldn&rsquo;t drink caffeine this many hours?</p>
<p>Like, is there an average half life</p>
<p>that you should be aiming at?</p>
<p>Or is this advice kind of impossible</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s so much variability?</p>
<p>There is huge variability.</p>
<p>And I think everyone themselves to a degree knows it,</p>
<p>although I&rsquo;ll put a caveat on that too</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a slightly dangerous point.</p>
<p>So the recommendation for the average adult</p>
<p>and who, where is the average adult in society?</p>
<p>There is no such thing.</p>
<p>But for the average adult,</p>
<p>it would be probably cutting yourself off maybe 10 hours</p>
<p>before.</p>
<p>So assuming a normative bedtime in society,</p>
<p>I would say try to stop drinking caffeine before 2 p.m.</p>
<p>and just keep an eye out.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re struggling with sleep,</p>
<p>dial down the caffeine and see if it makes a difference.</p>
<p>Can I ask you about sleep and learning?</p>
<p>So how does sleep affect learning?</p>
<p>Sleep before learning, sleep after learning,</p>
<p>which are both fascinating kind of dynamics</p>
<p>of the mind&rsquo;s interaction with this extra conscious state.</p>
<p>Yeah, sleep is profoundly and very intimately related</p>
<p>to your memory systems and your informational systems.</p>
<p>The first is you just mentioned is that</p>
<p>sleep before learning will essentially prepare your brain</p>
<p>almost like a dry sponge ready to sort of,</p>
<p>you know, initially soak up new information.</p>
<p>In other words, you need sleep before learning</p>
<p>to effectively imprint information into the brain</p>
<p>to lay down fresh memory traces.</p>
<p>And without sleep, the memory circuits of the brain,</p>
<p>and we know we&rsquo;ve studied these memory circuits,</p>
<p>will, you know, they essentially become waterlogged</p>
<p>as it were for the sponge analogy,</p>
<p>and you can&rsquo;t absorb the information as effectively.</p>
<p>So you need sleep before learning,</p>
<p>but you also need sleep unfortunately after learning too,</p>
<p>to then take those freshly minted memories</p>
<p>and effectively hit the save button on them,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s nowhere near as quick as a digital system.</p>
<p>It takes hours because it&rsquo;s a physical biological change</p>
<p>that happens at the level of brain cells.</p>
<p>But sleep after learning will cement and solidify</p>
<p>that new memory into the neural architecture of the brain,</p>
<p>therefore making it less likely to be forgotten.</p>
<p>So, you know, I often think of sleep in that way as,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost sort of future proofing information.</p>
<p>In what way?</p>
<p>Well, it means that it gives it a higher degree of assurance</p>
<p>to be remembered in the future</p>
<p>rather than go through the sort of degradation</p>
<p>that we think of as forgetting.</p>
<p>So the brain has in some ways by default,</p>
<p>you know, there is forget,</p>
<p>and actually I would love to,</p>
<p>I was going to say sleep is relevant for memory</p>
<p>in three different ways,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m going to amend that</p>
<p>and say there&rsquo;s four different ways,</p>
<p>which is learning, maintaining, memorizing,</p>
<p>abstraction, assimilation, association, then forgetting,</p>
<p>which the last one sounds oxymoronic</p>
<p>based on the former three, but I&rsquo;ll see if I can explain.</p>
<p>So sleep after learning then sort of, you know,</p>
<p>sets that information like amber in solidification.</p>
<p>The third benefit, however, is that sleep,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve learned more recently is much more intelligent</p>
<p>than we ever gave it credit for.</p>
<p>Sleep doesn&rsquo;t simply just take individual memories</p>
<p>and strengthen them.</p>
<p>Sleep will then intelligently integrate and cross link</p>
<p>and associate that information together.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s almost like informational alchemy.</p>
<p>So that you wake up the next morning</p>
<p>with a revised mind wide web of associations.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s probably the reason that, you know,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve never been told to stay awake on a problem.</p>
<p>And in every language that I&rsquo;ve inquired about that phrase</p>
<p>or something very similar seems to exist,</p>
<p>which means to me that this creative associative benefit</p>
<p>of sleep transcends cultural boundaries.</p>
<p>It is a common experience across humanity.</p>
<p>Now I should note that I think the French translation</p>
<p>of that is much closer to you.</p>
<p>I think you sleep with a problem.</p>
<p>Whereas the British, you sleep on a problem.</p>
<p>The French, you sleep with a problem.</p>
<p>I think it says so much about the romantic difference</p>
<p>between the British and the French, but let&rsquo;s not go there.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s brilliant.</p>
<p>So such a subtle, but such a fundamental difference.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Oh, goodness me.</p>
<p>Sleep with the problem.</p>
<p>Yes, exactly.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I love the French.</p>
<p>So, and we can sort of double click on any one of these</p>
<p>and go into detail, but the fourth,</p>
<p>I became really enchanted by about eight years ago</p>
<p>in our research, which was this idea of forgetting.</p>
<p>And I started to think that forgetting may be the price</p>
<p>that we pay for remembering.</p>
<p>And in that sense, there is an enormous benefit</p>
<p>to letting go.</p>
<p>And you may be thinking, that sounds ridiculous.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to forget.</p>
<p>In fact, my biggest problem is I keep forgetting things,</p>
<p>but the brain has a, well, we believe,</p>
<p>has a finite storage capacity.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t prove it yet, but my suspicion is</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s probably true.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t have an infinite storage capacity.</p>
<p>It has constraints.</p>
<p>If that&rsquo;s the case, we can&rsquo;t simply go through life</p>
<p>being constantly informational aggregators</p>
<p>unless we are programmed to say,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve got a hard drive space of about 85 to 90 years</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re good and we can do that.</p>
<p>Maybe that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>I think forgetting is an incredibly good and useful thing.</p>
<p>So for example, it&rsquo;s not beneficial</p>
<p>from an evolutionary perspective for me to remember</p>
<p>where I parked my car three years ago.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s important that I can remember today&rsquo;s parking spot,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t want to have the junk kind of DNA</p>
<p>from a memory perspective of where I parked my car</p>
<p>two years ago.</p>
<p>Now, I actually have in some ways a problem</p>
<p>with forgetting, and again, I&rsquo;m not trying</p>
<p>to sort of be laudatory, but you know,</p>
<p>I tend not to forget too many things.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think that that&rsquo;s a good thing.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a wonderful neurologist, Luria,</p>
<p>who wrote a book called The Mind of the Mnemonicist.</p>
<p>And it was a brilliant book,</p>
<p>both because it was written exquisitely,</p>
<p>but he was studying these sort of memory savants</p>
<p>who basically could remember everything that he gave them.</p>
<p>And he tried to find a chink in their armor.</p>
<p>And the first half of the book is essentially about him</p>
<p>seeing how far he can push them before they fail.</p>
<p>And he never found that place.</p>
<p>He could never find a place where they stopped remembering.</p>
<p>And then in his brilliance,</p>
<p>he turned the question on its head.</p>
<p>He said, not what is the benefit of constantly remembering,</p>
<p>but instead, what is the detriment to never forgetting?</p>
<p>And when you start to realize his descriptions</p>
<p>of those individuals, it&rsquo;s probably a life</p>
<p>that you would not want.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s fascinating both from a human perspective,</p>
<p>but also AI perspective.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a big challenge in the machine learning community</p>
<p>of how to build systems that are able to remember</p>
<p>for prolonged periods of time, lifelong continuous learning.</p>
<p>So where you build up information over time.</p>
<p>So memory is one of the biggest open problems</p>
<p>in AI and machine learning.</p>
<p>But at the same time,</p>
<p>the right way to formulate memory is actually forgetting</p>
<p>because you have to be exceptionally selective</p>
<p>at which kind of stuff you remember.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where the step of assimilation,</p>
<p>integration that you&rsquo;re referring to is really important.</p>
<p>I mean, we forget most of the things.</p>
<p>And the question is exactly the cost of forgetting</p>
<p>at the very edge of stuff that could be important</p>
<p>or could not be, how do we remember or not those things?</p>
<p>Like for example, doing a podcast,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve become cognizant of one feature of my forgetting</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s been problematic, which is I forget names</p>
<p>and titles of books and so on.</p>
<p>So when I read, I remember ideas.</p>
<p>I remember quotes, I remember statements</p>
<p>and like that&rsquo;s the space in which I&rsquo;m thinking.</p>
<p>But when you communicate to others,</p>
<p>you have to say this person in this book said that.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s the same thing with like Andrew Huberman</p>
<p>is masterful at this.</p>
<p>This is important academia,</p>
<p>remembering the authors of a paper</p>
<p>and the title of the paper as part of remembering the idea.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve been feeling the cost of not being able</p>
<p>to naturally remember those things.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s something I need to sort of work on,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s an example.</p>
<p>Are you good with faces?</p>
<p>Yes, very good at faces.</p>
<p>But not good with names.</p>
<p>So I am exactly like you.</p>
<p>And there is an understanding of that in the brain too.</p>
<p>We understand that there is partitioning of those</p>
<p>in terms of the territory of the brain</p>
<p>that takes care of faces and facts and places</p>
<p>and that they can be separate.</p>
<p>So I will never forget a face,</p>
<p>but as I said, I usually forget very little,</p>
<p>but for some reason, names are a struggle.</p>
<p>I think in some ways,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m probably just a slightly anxious person.</p>
<p>So when you first meet someone,</p>
<p>which is usually the time when a name is introduced,</p>
<p>you were saying you were sort of anxious maybe</p>
<p>about sort of sitting down with me,</p>
<p>but I find that a little bit activating.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s not as though there&rsquo;s anything wrong</p>
<p>with my memory.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just the emotional state I&rsquo;m in</p>
<p>when I&rsquo;m first meeting someone.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little bit perturbing,</p>
<p>but I will never forget the face.</p>
<p>I completely relate to that</p>
<p>because I almost don&rsquo;t hear people&rsquo;s names</p>
<p>when they tell me because I&rsquo;m so anxious.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But I think there&rsquo;s certain quirks of social interaction</p>
<p>that show that you care about the person,</p>
<p>that you remember that person,</p>
<p>that they matter to you,</p>
<p>that they had an impact on you.</p>
<p>And one of the ways to show that</p>
<p>is you remember their name.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s a quirk to me</p>
<p>because a lot of people I meet have a deep impact on me,</p>
<p>but I can&rsquo;t communicate that unless I know their name,</p>
<p>unless I know some of the details</p>
<p>that we humans seem to use to communicate</p>
<p>that we remember each other.</p>
<p>What I remember well is the feeling we shared,</p>
<p>is the experience we shared.</p>
<p>What I don&rsquo;t remember well is the detailed labels</p>
<p>of those experiences.</p>
<p>And I need to certainly work on that.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s just allowing yourself to be innate</p>
<p>and who you are is also a beautiful thing too.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not suggesting it&rsquo;s not important</p>
<p>to try and better oneself.</p>
<p>But I also sometimes worry about the misery</p>
<p>that that puts us in.</p>
<p>But like you, I do struggle with name,</p>
<p>but I know the first time when we met in the lobby,</p>
<p>I know exactly what you look like.</p>
<p>I know that you were wearing headphones.</p>
<p>I know the shape and the size of those headphones.</p>
<p>You didn&rsquo;t have your black jacket on.</p>
<p>I know exactly what the weave of your shirt looked like</p>
<p>and what your shoes look like.</p>
<p>And I knew exactly the height of your,</p>
<p>the end of your pants from the top of your shoes.</p>
<p>And so those things I don&rsquo;t forget.</p>
<p>And I can remember when people,</p>
<p>I met people two years ago and I&rsquo;ll say,</p>
<p>oh yes, we met there.</p>
<p>And I remember you had those fantastic boots on.</p>
<p>I thought they were pretty great pair of boots.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re like, how do you,</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t even remember what I was wearing that day.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m the exact same way,</p>
<p>but you can&rsquo;t, until we have Neuralink</p>
<p>or something like that,</p>
<p>we can&rsquo;t communicate that you remember all those things.</p>
<p>I know, that&rsquo;s what I wanted.</p>
<p>So you have to be able to use tricks</p>
<p>of human communication for that.</p>
<p>But so that, I mean, that&rsquo;s the,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s ultimately is a trick of like,</p>
<p>which to remember, which to forget.</p>
<p>And the forgetting is so, it&rsquo;s so fascinating to say this.</p>
<p>I mean, it seems to be deeply connected</p>
<p>to that assimilation process.</p>
<p>So forgetting, you try to fit all the new stuff</p>
<p>into this big web of the old stuff</p>
<p>and the things that don&rsquo;t fit, you throw out.</p>
<p>I think the assimilation,</p>
<p>the way I&rsquo;ve been thinking about it with sleep</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s particularly sort of dream sleep</p>
<p>that we think can help with this assimilation</p>
<p>is that during wake,</p>
<p>we have one version of associative processing.</p>
<p>And what I mean by that</p>
<p>is we see the most obvious connections.</p>
<p>So I think of wakefulness as a Google search gone right.</p>
<p>Whereas I see dream sleep as doing something very different.</p>
<p>I think dream sleep is a little bit</p>
<p>like group therapy for memories</p>
<p>that everyone gets a name badge</p>
<p>and sleep gathers in all of the individual pieces</p>
<p>of the day and it sort of starts to get you</p>
<p>to forces you, in fact, to speak to the people,</p>
<p>not at the front of the room</p>
<p>that you think you&rsquo;ve got the most obvious connection with,</p>
<p>but to speak with the people all the way</p>
<p>at the back of the room that at first you think,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got no idea what&rsquo;s going on in the room.</p>
<p>You think I&rsquo;ve got no obvious connection with them at all.</p>
<p>But once you get chatting with them,</p>
<p>you learn that you do have a very distant,</p>
<p>non obvious connection,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s still a connection on the same.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s almost as though you&rsquo;re doing a Google search</p>
<p>where I input Lex Friedman</p>
<p>and it doesn&rsquo;t take me to the first page of your home site.</p>
<p>It takes me to page 20,</p>
<p>which is about some like field hockey game in Utah.</p>
<p>It turns out that there actually is a link.</p>
<p>If I look at it, it&rsquo;s a distant, non obvious one.</p>
<p>And to me, I find that exciting</p>
<p>because when you fuse things together</p>
<p>that shouldn&rsquo;t normally go together,</p>
<p>but when they do, they cause marked advances</p>
<p>in evolutionary fitness.</p>
<p>It sounds like the biological basis of creativity.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s exactly what I think dream sleep</p>
<p>and the algorithm of dream sleep is designed to do.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a Boolean like system where you have</p>
<p>the sort of assumptions of true and false.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s more fuzzy logic system.</p>
<p>And I think REM sleep is a perfect environment</p>
<p>within which we do, it&rsquo;s almost like memory pinball.</p>
<p>You get the information that you&rsquo;ve learned during the day</p>
<p>and then you pull the lever back</p>
<p>and you shoot it up into the attic of your brain,</p>
<p>this cortex filled with all</p>
<p>of your past historical knowledge.</p>
<p>And you start to bounce it around</p>
<p>and see where one of those things lights up</p>
<p>and you build a new connection there</p>
<p>and you build another one there too.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re developing schemas.</p>
<p>And so in that way, I think you could argue,</p>
<p>we dream, therefore we are.</p>
<p>Yeah, so in terms of this line between learning</p>
<p>and thinking through a new thing</p>
<p>that seems to be deeply connected,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s this legendary engineer named Jim Keller</p>
<p>who keeps yelling at me about this.</p>
<p>He says it&rsquo;s very effective.</p>
<p>He likes to, for difficult problems before bed,</p>
<p>think about that difficult problem.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not talking about like drama at work</p>
<p>or all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>No, like a scientific for him engineering problem.</p>
<p>He likes to like intensely think about it</p>
<p>to prime his mind before sleep and then go to sleep.</p>
<p>And then he finds that the next day,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s able to think much clearer</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s new ideas that come,</p>
<p>but also just, I guess it&rsquo;s more well integrated.</p>
<p>And sometimes during the process of like,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s able to like wake up and like see new insights.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>If he&rsquo;s deeply sort of aggressively thinking through a problem.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s many scientific demonstrations of this.</p>
<p>The Mendeleev with the periodic table of elements,</p>
<p>he was trying for months to understand.</p>
<p>I mean, talk about an ecumenical problem</p>
<p>of epic proportions.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s your question today.</p>
<p>You have to understand how all of the known elements</p>
<p>in the universe fit together in a logical way.</p>
<p>Good luck, take care.</p>
<p>It was non trivial at the time.</p>
<p>And he would try and try, he was so obsessed with it.</p>
<p>He created playing cards</p>
<p>with all of the different elements on.</p>
<p>And then he would go on these long train journeys</p>
<p>around Europe and he would just sort of deal these cards</p>
<p>in front of them and he would shuffle them,</p>
<p>shuffling and shuffling.</p>
<p>And he would just try to see</p>
<p>if he could find what the answer was.</p>
<p>And then, so the story goes,</p>
<p>he fell asleep and he had a dream.</p>
<p>And in that dream,</p>
<p>all of these elements started to dance and play around</p>
<p>and they snapped into a logical grid,</p>
<p>atomic weights, et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p>And it wasn&rsquo;t his waking brain</p>
<p>that solved the problem.</p>
<p>It was his sleeping brain</p>
<p>that solved the impenetrable problem</p>
<p>that his waking brain could not.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s been count,</p>
<p>even in the arts and in music,</p>
<p>some wonderful dreams,</p>
<p>Frankenstein, Mary Shelley&rsquo;s epic Gothic novel</p>
<p>came to her in a dream at Lord Byron&rsquo;s home.</p>
<p>And then we&rsquo;ve got,</p>
<p>Paul McCartney.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the song came to him in a dream.</p>
<p>He was filming, gosh, what was the movie?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t recall it.</p>
<p>I should be shocked because I&rsquo;m from Liverpool myself.</p>
<p>And, but he was on Wimpole Street in London and filming.</p>
<p>And he came up with that song,</p>
<p>the melody in his sleep,</p>
<p>not to be outdone by the Beatles.</p>
<p>And by the way, Let It Be</p>
<p>also came from a dream that McCartney had.</p>
<p>People usually give it religious overtones.</p>
<p>Mother Mary comes to me speaking words of wisdom,</p>
<p>let it be.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve ever asked who Mother Mary is,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not the biblical content.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s his mother.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s Mary McCartney.</p>
<p>And she came to him in a dream and gifted him the song.</p>
<p>But the best story I&rsquo;ve heard</p>
<p>is not to be outdone by the Beatles.</p>
<p>The Stones, Keith Richards,</p>
<p>who I think once was suggested it.</p>
<p>Who was it?</p>
<p>It was a comedian who was saying that</p>
<p>in an interview with Rolling Stone,</p>
<p>Keith Richards suggested or inferred</p>
<p>that young kids should not do drugs.</p>
<p>And they said, well, look,</p>
<p>young kids can&rsquo;t do drugs</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;ve done all of the drugs.</p>
<p>And I always thought that,</p>
<p>but Keith Richards described he would always go to bed</p>
<p>with his guitar and a tape recorder.</p>
<p>And then probably who would have a whole set</p>
<p>of other things in the bed with him.</p>
<p>And who knows how many other people, but anyway.</p>
<p>And then he said in his autobiography,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m paraphrasing here,</p>
<p>but one morning I woke up and I realized</p>
<p>that the tape had recorded all the way to the end.</p>
<p>So I rewound the tape and I hit play.</p>
<p>And there in some kind of ghostly form</p>
<p>were the opening chords to Satisfaction,</p>
<p>the most famous successful Rolling Stone song</p>
<p>of all time.</p>
<p>Followed by then 43 minutes of snoring.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s awesome.</p>
<p>That riff came to him.</p>
<p>One of the most famous riffs in all of rock and roll</p>
<p>came to him by way of a dream inspired insight.</p>
<p>So I think there is too many of those anecdotes.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve now got the side,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t rely on anecdotes as science.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve now done the studies in the laboratory</p>
<p>and we can reliably demonstrate</p>
<p>that sleep inspires creativity,</p>
<p>inspires problem solving capacity.</p>
<p>Well, the interesting thing is,</p>
<p>is it possible to some of the ideas that you talk about</p>
<p>to turn them into a protocol</p>
<p>that could be practiced rigorously?</p>
<p>So what Jim Keller espouses is saying,</p>
<p>not just the fact that sleep helps you</p>
<p>increase the creativity,</p>
<p>but turn it into a process.</p>
<p>Like literally, like don&rsquo;t do it accidentally.</p>
<p>Like an athlete does certain things</p>
<p>to optimize their performance.</p>
<p>They have a training routine.</p>
<p>They have a regimen of like cycling and sprints</p>
<p>and long distance stuff.</p>
<p>In the same way, thinking about your job</p>
<p>as an idea generator in the engineering space</p>
<p>is like, this is good for my performance.</p>
<p>So like for an hour before bed,</p>
<p>think through a problem like every night</p>
<p>and then use sleep to work through that problem.</p>
<p>I mean, he&rsquo;s the first person that I heard</p>
<p>like of the people I really respect that do like what I do,</p>
<p>which is like programming engineering type work,</p>
<p>like using sleep, not accidentally, but with a purpose,</p>
<p>like using sleep.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just basically the difference between,</p>
<p>as you said, a passive approach to it</p>
<p>versus an active deterministic</p>
<p>or hope for a deterministic approach to it.</p>
<p>In other words, that you are actually trying to harness</p>
<p>the power of sleep in a deliberate way</p>
<p>rather than an unthoughtful way.</p>
<p>I still think that mother nature through it,</p>
<p>the 3.6 million years of evolution</p>
<p>has probably got it mostly figured out</p>
<p>in terms of what information should be uploaded at night</p>
<p>and worked through.</p>
<p>I think her algorithm is probably pretty good at this stage.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not to suggest though,</p>
<p>that we can&rsquo;t try to tweak it and nudge it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very light hand on the tiller is what he&rsquo;s doing.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s anything wrong with that.</p>
<p>Just like, for example, for me,</p>
<p>fasting has improved my ability to focus deeply</p>
<p>and productivity significantly.</p>
<p>And in that same way,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s possible that playing with these ideas</p>
<p>of thinking before bed or some hours before bed</p>
<p>or some playing with different protocols</p>
<p>will have a significant leap</p>
<p>over what mother nature naturally does.</p>
<p>So if you let your body do what it naturally does,</p>
<p>you may not achieve the same level of performance</p>
<p>because mother nature has not designed us</p>
<p>to think deeply about chip design</p>
<p>or programming artificial intelligence systems.</p>
<p>Well, she&rsquo;s gifted us the architecture</p>
<p>and the capacity to do that.</p>
<p>What we do with that is what life&rsquo;s experience dictates.</p>
<p>She gives us the blueprint to do many.</p>
<p>Well, if I were to sort of introspect</p>
<p>and self analyze what mother nature wants me to do,</p>
<p>I think given my current lifestyle</p>
<p>that I have food in the fridge</p>
<p>and a bed to sleep on,</p>
<p>I think what mother nature wants me to do is to be lazy.</p>
<p>And so I think I&rsquo;m actually resisting mother nature</p>
<p>because so many of my needs are satisfied.</p>
<p>And so I have to resist some of the natural forces</p>
<p>of the body and the mind</p>
<p>when I do some of the things I do.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s that dance,</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;ve been thinking about doing a startup</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s obviously going against everything</p>
<p>that my body and mind are telling me to do</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s going to be basically suffering.</p>
<p>But the only reason I want&hellip;</p>
<p>As you know, it will be over.</p>
<p>Yes, but nevertheless,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some kind of inner drive that wants me to do it.</p>
<p>And then you start to ask a question,</p>
<p>well, how do you optimize the things you can&rsquo;t optimize</p>
<p>like sleep, like diet,</p>
<p>like the people that you surround yourself with</p>
<p>in order to maximize happiness and performance</p>
<p>and all those kinds of things without also over optimizing.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s such an interesting idea from a engineer.</p>
<p>So as you may know,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t often get those kinds of ideas from engineers.</p>
<p>Engineers usually just don&rsquo;t read books about sleeping.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re usually like the&hellip;</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not the healthiest of people.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s changing over time,</p>
<p>especially with Silicon Valley,</p>
<p>especially with the tech sector.</p>
<p>People are starting to understand what&rsquo;s a healthy lifestyle,</p>
<p>but usually they&rsquo;re kind of on the insane side,</p>
<p>especially programmers.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s nice to hear somebody like that use sleep</p>
<p>and use some of the things that you talk about</p>
<p>strategically on purpose.</p>
<p>When I get to that idea of not just trying to use</p>
<p>what Mother Nature gave,</p>
<p>but seeing if you can do something more or different,</p>
<p>in a conservative mindset,</p>
<p>I would then pose the question at what cost?</p>
<p>Because when you do something perhaps</p>
<p>that deviates from the typical pre programmed,</p>
<p>you know, Mother Nature&rsquo;s program,</p>
<p>I suspect it usually comes at the cost of something else.</p>
<p>So maybe he is able to direct and focus</p>
<p>his sleeping cognition on those particular topics</p>
<p>that will gain him better problematic resolution</p>
<p>the next day when he wakes up.</p>
<p>The question is though,</p>
<p>at what cost of the other things that didn&rsquo;t make it</p>
<p>onto the menu of the finger buffet of sleep that night?</p>
<p>And is it that you don&rsquo;t process</p>
<p>the emotional difficulties or events,</p>
<p>and therefore you are less emotionally resolved the next day,</p>
<p>but you are more problem resolved the following day.</p>
<p>And so I always try to think,</p>
<p>and I truly don&rsquo;t want to sound puritanical</p>
<p>either about sleep,</p>
<p>and I think I&rsquo;ve come off that way many a times,</p>
<p>especially when I started out in the public.</p>
<p>The tone of the book, in some ways,</p>
<p>I look back and think, could I have been a little softer?</p>
<p>And the reason was I was that way back in</p>
<p>when I started writing the book,</p>
<p>which was probably something like 2014 or 15,</p>
<p>sleep was the neglected stepsister</p>
<p>in the health conversation of the day.</p>
<p>And I was just so sad to see the amount of suffering</p>
<p>and disease and sickness that was caused</p>
<p>by insufficient sleep.</p>
<p>And for years before I&rsquo;d been doing public speaking,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;d tell people about the great things</p>
<p>that happen when you get sleep.</p>
<p>People would say, that&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>And then they would go back and keep doing the same thing</p>
<p>about not sleeping enough.</p>
<p>And then I realized you can&rsquo;t really speak</p>
<p>about the good things that happen.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the news, what bleeds leads.</p>
<p>And if you speak about the alarmingly bad things</p>
<p>that happen, people tend to have a behavioral change.</p>
<p>And so the book as a consequence,</p>
<p>I think probably came out a little bit on the strong side</p>
<p>of trying to convince people.</p>
<p>Well, you were trying to help a lot of people</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s a powerful way to help a lot of people.</p>
<p>I was genuinely trying to help people,</p>
<p>but certainly for some people for whom sleep</p>
<p>does not come easy, then it was probably</p>
<p>a tricky book to read too.</p>
<p>And I think I feel more sensitive to those people now</p>
<p>and empathetically connected to them.</p>
<p>So I think the, again, the point was simply</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t mean to sound too puritanical in all of this.</p>
<p>And the same way with caffeine and coffee.</p>
<p>I am just a scientist and I am not here to tell anyone</p>
<p>how to live their life.</p>
<p>That is not my job at all.</p>
<p>And life is to be lived to a degree</p>
<p>and life is to be lived if you want to do a startup.</p>
<p>All I want to do is empower people</p>
<p>with the understanding of the science of sleep.</p>
<p>And then you can make an informed choice</p>
<p>as to how you want to live your life.</p>
<p>And I offer no judgment on how anyone</p>
<p>wishes to live their life.</p>
<p>I just want to try and see if the information</p>
<p>that I have about sleep would alternatively change</p>
<p>how you would think about your life decisions.</p>
<p>And if it doesn&rsquo;t, no problem.</p>
<p>And if it does, I hope it&rsquo;s been of use.</p>
<p>Well, maybe this is me trying</p>
<p>to justify my lifestyle to you.</p>
<p>But Dr. Seuss said, you know you&rsquo;re in love</p>
<p>when you can&rsquo;t fall asleep because reality</p>
<p>is finally better than your dreams.</p>
<p>I love that quote too.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>My sleeping schedule is complicated</p>
<p>and it has to do primarily with the fact</p>
<p>that I love basically everything that I do.</p>
<p>And that love takes a form that may not appear</p>
<p>to be love from the external observer perspective.</p>
<p>Cause it&rsquo;s often includes struggle.</p>
<p>It often includes something that looks like stress</p>
<p>even though it&rsquo;s not stress.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like this excitement, it&rsquo;s this turmoil</p>
<p>and chaos of passion, of struggling with a problem</p>
<p>of being sad and down to the point even depressed</p>
<p>of how difficult the problem is, the disappointment</p>
<p>that the last few weeks and months have been a failure</p>
<p>and self doubt, all that mix.</p>
<p>But I love it.</p>
<p>And a part of that is sometimes staying up all night</p>
<p>working on a thing I&rsquo;m really passionate about.</p>
<p>And that means sleep schedules that are just like,</p>
<p>you know, sometimes sleeping during the day,</p>
<p>sometimes very often sleeping very little</p>
<p>but taking naps that are like an hour, two hours and so on.</p>
<p>That kind of weird chaos.</p>
<p>And now I&rsquo;ll also try to give myself back up.</p>
<p>I was trying to like research yesterday</p>
<p>is anybody else productive, wild like this?</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s of course a lot of anecdotal evidence</p>
<p>and some of it could be just narratives</p>
<p>that people have told to the public</p>
<p>when in reality they sleep way more.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a bunch of people that are famous</p>
<p>for not sleeping much.</p>
<p>So on the topic of naps, I read this a long time ago</p>
<p>and I checked this, Churchill was big on big naps.</p>
<p>And is actually just reading more</p>
<p>about Winston Churchill&rsquo;s sleep schedule</p>
<p>is very much like mine.</p>
<p>So I basically wanna give myself the opportunity</p>
<p>to at night to stay up all night if I want to.</p>
<p>And a good nap is a big part of that in the late evening.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;ll often, this destroys social life completely</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ll often take a nap in the late afternoon</p>
<p>or the evening and that sets me</p>
<p>if I want to stay up all night.</p>
<p>And things like that, that I read that Nikola Tesla</p>
<p>slept only two hours a night, Edison the same three hours</p>
<p>but he actually did the polyphasic sleep</p>
<p>like where it&rsquo;s just a bunch of naps.</p>
<p>What can you say about this madness of love</p>
<p>and passion of loving everything you do</p>
<p>and the chaos of sleep that might result in?</p>
<p>I love the Seuss quote and I&rsquo;ve had that experience too.</p>
<p>Like you, I adore what I do.</p>
<p>If someone gave you enough money</p>
<p>to live the rest of your life,</p>
<p>got a roof above my head, rice and beans on the table</p>
<p>and they said, you don&rsquo;t have to work anymore.</p>
<p>I would do nothing different.</p>
<p>I would do exactly, this sounds a little crass</p>
<p>and I hope it doesn&rsquo;t sound this way</p>
<p>but being a scientist is not what I do, it&rsquo;s who I am.</p>
<p>And when that&rsquo;s the case, sleep, working out,</p>
<p>showering and eating are the things that I do</p>
<p>in between my love affair with sleep.</p>
<p>I fell for sleep like a blind roofer.</p>
<p>And it was a love affair that started 20 years ago</p>
<p>and I remain utterly besotted today.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the most beguiling thing in the world to me.</p>
<p>And I could easily and I have, it&rsquo;s kept me up at night.</p>
<p>When my mind is fizzing with experimental ideas</p>
<p>or I think I&rsquo;ve got a new hypothesis or theory,</p>
<p>I will struggle with sleep.</p>
<p>I really will, it doesn&rsquo;t come easy to me</p>
<p>because my mind is just so on fire with those ideas.</p>
<p>So I understand the struggle,</p>
<p>but I couldn&rsquo;t advocate from a scientific perspective,</p>
<p>the schedule because the science just doesn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>I would feel as though I&rsquo;m doing you a disservice</p>
<p>to say it&rsquo;s okay, that won&rsquo;t come with some blast radius,</p>
<p>some health consequences.</p>
<p>You can add Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan</p>
<p>to that list too.</p>
<p>Both of them were very proud chest beaters</p>
<p>of how little sleep that they get.</p>
<p>Thatcher said four hours, Reagan something similar.</p>
<p>And I, knowing the links that we now know</p>
<p>between sleep and Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve often wondered whether it was coincidental then</p>
<p>that both of them died of the terrible disease of Alzheimer&rsquo;s</p>
<p>meaning, maybe it doesn&rsquo;t get you by way of</p>
<p>being popped out of the gene pool in a car accident</p>
<p>because you had a microsleep at the wheel at age 32,</p>
<p>or it doesn&rsquo;t get you at 42 with heart attack</p>
<p>or even 52 with cancer or a stroke,</p>
<p>maybe it gets you in your seventies.</p>
<p>I think the elastic band of sleep deprivation</p>
<p>can stretch only so far before it snaps</p>
<p>and it ultimately seems to snap.</p>
<p>Nicola Tesla, I think he died of a coronary thrombosis,</p>
<p>I believe.</p>
<p>And there was a wonderful study done out of Harvard</p>
<p>where they took a group of people who had no signs</p>
<p>of cardiovascular disease.</p>
<p>And what they found is that when they track them</p>
<p>for years afterwards, they were completely healthy</p>
<p>to begin with.</p>
<p>Those people who are getting less than six hours of sleep</p>
<p>ended up having a 300% increased risk</p>
<p>of developing calcification of the coronary artery,</p>
<p>which is the major sort of corridor of life for your heart.</p>
<p>When someone says, he died of a massive coronary,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s because of a blockade of the coronary artery.</p>
<p>And Tesla passed away from a coronary thrombosis.</p>
<p>We also know that insufficient sleep</p>
<p>is linked to numerous mental health issues.</p>
<p>We know that Churchill had a wicked battle with depression.</p>
<p>Gosh, my goodness, he used to call it black dog</p>
<p>that would come and visit him.</p>
<p>And I think many of his paintings,</p>
<p>he was exquisite painter,</p>
<p>but some of them would depict his darkness</p>
<p>with depression as well.</p>
<p>Edison is interesting.</p>
<p>People have argued that he would short sleep</p>
<p>and he didn&rsquo;t put much value in sleep.</p>
<p>Whether or not that&rsquo;s true, we don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>but he was a habitual napper.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re right, during the day,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got some great pictures of him on his inventor&rsquo;s bench</p>
<p>taking a nap.</p>
<p>And in fact, I believe he set up nap carts around his house</p>
<p>so he could nap.</p>
<p>But what we also know, a study, again,</p>
<p>coming out of Harvard just a couple of months ago,</p>
<p>demonstrated very clearly that polyphasic sleep</p>
<p>is associated with worse physical outcomes,</p>
<p>worse cognitive outcomes,</p>
<p>and especially worse mood outcomes.</p>
<p>So from that sense,</p>
<p>sleeping like a baby is not perfect for adults.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a fascinating dance here</p>
<p>of the mean and the extreme,</p>
<p>like the average and the high performers.</p>
<p>So I,</p>
<p>this gets to like the meaning of life kind of discussion,</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s go that way.</p>
<p>And also happiness.</p>
<p>So when studying sleep and when studying anything</p>
<p>like diet and exercise,</p>
<p>I think you have to really get a lot more data</p>
<p>about individuals to make</p>
<p>conclusive statement.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when people talk about like,</p>
<p>is meat, red meat good for you or bad for you, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just so often correlated with other life decisions</p>
<p>when you choose to eat meat or not.</p>
<p>My sense is that whatever life decisions you make,</p>
<p>if they reduce stress and lead to happiness,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s also going to be a big boost</p>
<p>that needs to be integrated</p>
<p>into the plots in the science, right?</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll give you an example of somebody</p>
<p>who is unarguably seen as unhealthy.</p>
<p>My friend, Mr. David Goggins.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s clearly, obviously,</p>
<p>almost on purpose destroying his body.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s destroying his body and to say</p>
<p>that he&rsquo;s doing the wrong thing or the unhealthy thing</p>
<p>feels like, feels wrong.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m not sure exactly in which way he feels wrong.</p>
<p>One of the things I&rsquo;m bothered by,</p>
<p>and again, I apologize for the therapy sessions,</p>
<p>a framework of this,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m bothered by the fact that a lot of people</p>
<p>tell me or David that they&rsquo;re doing things wrong.</p>
<p>A lot of people in my life, when they see me not sleep,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll tell me to sleep more.</p>
<p>Now they&rsquo;re correct, but one fundamental aspect</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;d like to complain about is not enough people,</p>
<p>almost nobody, especially people that care for me,</p>
<p>will come to me and say,</p>
<p>you have a dream, work harder.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the healthy thing should be a component</p>
<p>of a life well lived, but not everything.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know what to do with that</p>
<p>because you certainly don&rsquo;t want to espouse.</p>
<p>And just like you said, when you were working in your book,</p>
<p>there is a belief, sleep was a secondary citizen</p>
<p>in the full spectrum of what&rsquo;s a healthy life.</p>
<p>But at the same time, I&rsquo;m bothered by in Silicon Valley</p>
<p>and all these kinds of work environments</p>
<p>that I get to work with, with engineers,</p>
<p>is there&rsquo;s to me too much focus on work life balance.</p>
<p>And what that usually starts meaning is like,</p>
<p>yeah, yeah, of course, it&rsquo;s good to have a social life,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s good to have a family,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s good to eat well and sleep well,</p>
<p>but we should also discover our passion.</p>
<p>We should also give ourselves a chance</p>
<p>to work our ass off towards a dream</p>
<p>and make mistakes and take big risks</p>
<p>that in the short term seem to sacrifice health.</p>
<p>And I think to come back to how you started</p>
<p>about David Goggins, who I&rsquo;ve never met,</p>
<p>but who I admire incredibly</p>
<p>and have an immense reverence for the man.</p>
<p>You said two things,</p>
<p>is it wrong to do those things to yourself?</p>
<p>And is it unhealthy to do those things to yourself?</p>
<p>I disagree with the former and I agree with the latter.</p>
<p>So from a health biological medicine perspective,</p>
<p>sleeping in the way that you&rsquo;ve described</p>
<p>or that other people may be sleeping</p>
<p>in terms of insufficient amounts,</p>
<p>now to your point too about into individual differences,</p>
<p>usually when I see a bar graph and a mean,</p>
<p>I usually say, show me your variance.</p>
<p>I want to see your variance.</p>
<p>In other words, show me the distribution of that effect.</p>
<p>How many people were below the mean?</p>
<p>How many, is it all tightly clustered around this one thing?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a very robust effect</p>
<p>or was this huge fan of effect where for some people</p>
<p>there was no effect at all and other people</p>
<p>there was a whopping effect and everything in between.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t discount into individual variability,</p>
<p>but, and I will come back to those two points about,</p>
<p>is it wrong and is it unhealthy in just a second?</p>
<p>When it comes to sleep,</p>
<p>we have found huge amounts of into individual differences</p>
<p>in your response to a lack of sleep.</p>
<p>But one of the fascinating things,</p>
<p>so let&rsquo;s say that I take you</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re going to measure your attention,</p>
<p>your emotion, your mood, your blood pressure,</p>
<p>your blood sugar glucose regulation,</p>
<p>your autonomic nervous system</p>
<p>and your different gene expression.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say I&rsquo;m just going to measure a whole kaleidoscope</p>
<p>of different outcomes, brain and body.</p>
<p>And I find that on our measure of cognition</p>
<p>on your attentional ability to focus,</p>
<p>you are very resilient.</p>
<p>You just don&rsquo;t show any impairment at all</p>
<p>even after being awake for 36 hours straight.</p>
<p>Does that mean that you are resilient</p>
<p>in all of those other domains as well?</p>
<p>The answer is no, you&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>So you can be resilient in one,</p>
<p>but very vulnerable in another.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve not found anyone who isn&rsquo;t at least vulnerable</p>
<p>in one of those domains,</p>
<p>meaning that it&rsquo;s somewhat safe to say that</p>
<p>not getting sufficient sleep will lead</p>
<p>to some kind of impairment in any one given individual.</p>
<p>It may not be the same impairment,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s likely to be an impairment.</p>
<p>But to come back to the question,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s wrong to tell anyone</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s wrong to do what they&rsquo;re doing,</p>
<p>even if they are compromising their sleep,</p>
<p>even if they&rsquo;re compromising their mental health.</p>
<p>As long as they&rsquo;re not hurting anyone else,</p>
<p>then I think the answer is</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s that person&rsquo;s choice.</p>
<p>Yeah, but that&rsquo;s that person&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to push back further.</p>
<p>So see, the way you kind of said it,</p>
<p>yes, you&rsquo;re absolutely right.</p>
<p>But I would like to say a stronger statement,</p>
<p>which is you should let go of that judgment</p>
<p>of somebody is wrong</p>
<p>and allow yourself to be inspired</p>
<p>by the great heights they have reached.</p>
<p>So take yourself out of the seat of being a judger</p>
<p>of what is healthy or not,</p>
<p>and appreciate the greatness of a particular human.</p>
<p>You watch the Olympics,</p>
<p>the kind of things that some athletes do</p>
<p>to reach the very heights.</p>
<p>The Olympics are taking years off of their life.</p>
<p>They suffer depression after the Olympics often.</p>
<p>The physiology is disastrous.</p>
<p>Everything, their personal life,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s their psychology, their physiology,</p>
<p>everything, it&rsquo;s a giant mess.</p>
<p>So the question is about life.</p>
<p>Healthy now means longevity,</p>
<p>quality of life over a prolonged period of time,</p>
<p>optimum performance over a prolonged period of time.</p>
<p>But to me, beauty is reaching great heights.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a dance there</p>
<p>that sometimes reaching great heights</p>
<p>requires sacrifice of health</p>
<p>and not like a calculation</p>
<p>where you sat down on a sheet of paper</p>
<p>and say, I&rsquo;m going to take seven years off my life</p>
<p>for an Olympic gold medal.</p>
<p>No, it requires more chaotic journey</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t do that kind of calculus.</p>
<p>And I just want to kind of speak to the,</p>
<p>in the culture that struggles of what is healthy and not,</p>
<p>we want to be able to speak to what is healthy</p>
<p>and at the same time be inspired by the great heights</p>
<p>that humans reach no matter how healthy</p>
<p>or unhealthy they live.</p>
<p>Yeah, I agree with that.</p>
<p>I think if that&rsquo;s a flag you&rsquo;re hoisting,</p>
<p>I will definitely salute it because it really depends,</p>
<p>what are you trying to optimize for in your life?</p>
<p>And if you are,</p>
<p>I think the only danger potentially with that mindset</p>
<p>is that if you look at many of the studies</p>
<p>of old age and end of life,</p>
<p>most people say I never look back on my life</p>
<p>and wish I worked harder.</p>
<p>I wish instead I&rsquo;d spent more time with family, friends</p>
<p>and engaged in that aspect.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m not saying though, coming back to your point,</p>
<p>that that is the standard rubric for everyone.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe it is too.</p>
<p>And there are many things that you and I</p>
<p>are both benefiting from today,</p>
<p>even in the field of medicine,</p>
<p>where people have sacrificed their own longevity</p>
<p>for the quest of solving a particular medical problem.</p>
<p>And they died quicker because of their commitment,</p>
<p>because they wished to try and solve that problem</p>
<p>in their pursuit of greatness scientifically.</p>
<p>And I now benefit.</p>
<p>Am I grateful that they did that?</p>
<p>Incredibly grateful.</p>
<p>You know, a simpler demonstration is this.</p>
<p>If tonight at 4 a.m. in the morning,</p>
<p>I have a ruptured appendix, I have an appendicitis,</p>
<p>I am incredibly grateful that there is an emergency team</p>
<p>that will take me to the hospital at 4 a.m. in the morning.</p>
<p>They are awake, they&rsquo;re not sleeping and they save my life.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s part of what their life&rsquo;s mission and quest is.</p>
<p>And they saved another&rsquo;s life by, in some ways,</p>
<p>shaving a little of their own off.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t take, I have no umbrage</p>
<p>with that mentality at all.</p>
<p>I think you just have to be very clear</p>
<p>about what you&rsquo;re optimizing for.</p>
<p>And my worry is that most people fall into the rat race</p>
<p>and they never actually ask the question,</p>
<p>why am I doing this?</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re just working nine to five or,</p>
<p>and you allow that nine to five to stretch</p>
<p>into much longer, but it&rsquo;s nevertheless a job</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s kind of like wears you down.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one thing.</p>
<p>Another thing is when it is like, you&rsquo;re,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a dream, it&rsquo;s a life mission.</p>
<p>And for that, I think as long as you know what it is</p>
<p>that you could be doing to yourself</p>
<p>and you are comfortable and A okay with that,</p>
<p>I have no problem with that at all.</p>
<p>Again, as I said, as a scientist, I cannot, should not,</p>
<p>and will not tell anyone what they should do with their life.</p>
<p>All I want you to be able to do is say, okay,</p>
<p>now I understand more about the,</p>
<p>previously these would be known unknowns</p>
<p>and these were the unknown unknowns.</p>
<p>And now I am slightly more cognizant.</p>
<p>I have more knowns than I had before</p>
<p>regarding my sleep and my health,</p>
<p>knowing that information,</p>
<p>do I still choose to make this decision?</p>
<p>And if that&rsquo;s what I offered,</p>
<p>then I think I&rsquo;ve done my job.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all I want to offer is just added information</p>
<p>into the decision algorithm.</p>
<p>And what you end up choosing as an output of that algorithm</p>
<p>has nothing to do with me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not my business and I will never judge anyone for it.</p>
<p>And as I said, I&rsquo;m immensely grateful for people</p>
<p>who have sacrificed much in their lives</p>
<p>to give me what I have.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re saying as long as the sacrifice sort of grounded</p>
<p>in knowledge of what the sacrifice is,</p>
<p>that sleep is important, all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>And that you&rsquo;re comfortable with it.</p>
<p>That is, it is your conscious choice</p>
<p>rather than feeling as though you&rsquo;re trapped</p>
<p>or that you are just, you haven&rsquo;t thought about it.</p>
<p>And you start that job at age 32</p>
<p>and then you wake up the next morning and you&rsquo;re 65</p>
<p>and you think, where did my life go?</p>
<p>What was I doing?</p>
<p>That to me, I would feel, I would want to hug you.</p>
<p>And I would say, I&rsquo;m just, and I&rsquo;m not saying,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to sound belittling here at all.</p>
<p>I would just not wish that for you.</p>
<p>I would wish that you could have thought about</p>
<p>what it was that you&rsquo;re doing and not have that regret.</p>
<p>Yeah, so I guess I&rsquo;m, this is for you, the listener.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m coming out of the closet here a little bit.</p>
<p>The fact that I enjoy the madness I live in.</p>
<p>So please do not criticize me, embrace me.</p>
<p>I understand the sacrifices I&rsquo;m making.</p>
<p>I enjoy sleeping on the floor</p>
<p>when I&rsquo;m passionate programming all night</p>
<p>and just pass out on the carpet.</p>
<p>I love this life.</p>
<p>Okay, so it&rsquo;s, but it&rsquo;s definitely something I think about</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a balance, a strike where.</p>
<p>I just want you to have as much of it though.</p>
<p>Of life.</p>
<p>See, quality of life is important.</p>
<p>I should have said,</p>
<p>I want you to have as much high quality life.</p>
<p>And if high quality of life means</p>
<p>I spend five decades on this planet,</p>
<p>but yet in that time, I am thrilled every day.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m turned on every day by what I do.</p>
<p>And I reveled in this thing called my life&rsquo;s work.</p>
<p>I think that that is a 50 year journey</p>
<p>of absolute delight and fulfillment that you should take.</p>
<p>I think about my death all the time.</p>
<p>I meditate on death.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m okay to die today.</p>
<p>So to me, longevity is not a significant goal.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so happy to be alive.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even think it would suck to die today.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m as afraid of it today as I will be in 50 years.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna die as much today as I will in 50 years.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s of course all these experiences</p>
<p>I would like to have, but everything&rsquo;s already amazing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like that Lego movie.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>So to me, I just wanna keep doing this.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s of course things that could affect,</p>
<p>like you mentioned, dementia and these deterioration</p>
<p>of the mind or the body that can significantly affect</p>
<p>the quality of life.</p>
<p>And so you want to do.</p>
<p>As long as you&rsquo;re aware of that,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s the price you pay for the entry</p>
<p>into this magical kingdom that you are experiencing,</p>
<p>which is a lovely thing.</p>
<p>I feel privileged too.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t believe the life that I live.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s incredible.</p>
<p>And just like you, I think about mortality a great deal.</p>
<p>I think a lot about death, but I don&rsquo;t worry about death.</p>
<p>I probably, with the exception of the potential pain</p>
<p>that comes before it, that some people,</p>
<p>many people can suffer, that maybe concerns me.</p>
<p>But I actually think about mortality as a tool,</p>
<p>I use it as a lens through which I can then retrospect.</p>
<p>And by placing myself at the point of future mortality,</p>
<p>I can then use it as a retrospective lens</p>
<p>to focus and ask the following question.</p>
<p>Is there anything I feel I would regret</p>
<p>and therefore change in the life that I currently have now?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the way I meditate and use mortality as a question,</p>
<p>is to try and course correct and focus my life.</p>
<p>I worry not about dying,</p>
<p>but I like to think about death</p>
<p>as a way to prioritize my life.</p>
<p>If that makes sense, I don&rsquo;t know if that makes sense.</p>
<p>No, it makes total sense to decide</p>
<p>how do you want to live today</p>
<p>so that in the future you do not regret</p>
<p>the way you&rsquo;ve lived today.</p>
<p>Right, and to place yourself in the future</p>
<p>at your point of mortality is one way to, I think,</p>
<p>as an exercise to retrospectively look back</p>
<p>and not lose out on informed choices</p>
<p>that you could otherwise lose out on</p>
<p>if you weren&rsquo;t thinking about mortality.</p>
<p>Yeah, it clarifies your thinking.</p>
<p>So I mentioned I sleep on the floor,</p>
<p>take naps and power naps, and it&rsquo;s just kind of madness.</p>
<p>Is there weirdnesses to your own sleep schedule</p>
<p>as a scientist that does incredible work,</p>
<p>has a lot of things going on,</p>
<p>has to lead research, has to write research,</p>
<p>has to be a science communicator,</p>
<p>also have a social life, all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>Is there certain patterns to your own sleep</p>
<p>that you regret or you participate in</p>
<p>that you find you enjoy?</p>
<p>Is there some personal stuff,</p>
<p>quirks or things you&rsquo;re proud of</p>
<p>that you do in terms of your sleep schedule?</p>
<p>The funny thing about being a sleep researcher</p>
<p>is that it doesn&rsquo;t make you immune</p>
<p>to the ravages of difficult nights of sleep,</p>
<p>and I have battled my own periods of insomnia in my life too.</p>
<p>And I think I&rsquo;ve been fortunate in ways</p>
<p>because I know how sleep works</p>
<p>and I know how to combat insomnia.</p>
<p>I know how to get it under control</p>
<p>because insomnia in many ways is a condition</p>
<p>where all of a sudden your sleep controls you</p>
<p>rather than you control your sleep.</p>
<p>Wow, yeah, that&rsquo;s a beautiful way to put it, yeah.</p>
<p>And I know when I&rsquo;m starting to lose control</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s starting to take control,</p>
<p>and I understand how to regain,</p>
<p>but it doesn&rsquo;t happen overnight.</p>
<p>It takes a long time.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve struggled with insomnia in your life?</p>
<p>I have, not all of my life.</p>
<p>I would say I&rsquo;ve probably had three or four</p>
<p>really severe bouts, and all of them usually triggered</p>
<p>by emotional circumstances, by stress.</p>
<p>Stress that&rsquo;s connected to actual events in life</p>
<p>or stress that&rsquo;s unexplainable?</p>
<p>Well, externally triggered.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s sort of what we would call reactive stress.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s sort of point number one</p>
<p>about the idiosyncrasies.</p>
<p>The point number two is that when you are having</p>
<p>a difficult night of sleep, as a sleep researcher,</p>
<p>you basically have become the Woody Allen neurotic</p>
<p>of the sleep world.</p>
<p>Because at that moment, I&rsquo;m trying to fall asleep</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m not, and I&rsquo;m starting to think,</p>
<p>okay, my dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex</p>
<p>is not shutting down.</p>
<p>My noradrenaline is not ramping down.</p>
<p>My sympathetic nervous system</p>
<p>is not giving way to my parasympathetic.</p>
<p>At that point, you are dead in the water</p>
<p>for the next two hours and nothing is bringing you back.</p>
<p>So there is some irony in that too.</p>
<p>I would say for myself though,</p>
<p>if there is something I&rsquo;m not proud of,</p>
<p>it has been at times railing against my chronotype.</p>
<p>So your chronotype is essentially,</p>
<p>are you a morning type, evening type</p>
<p>or somewhere in between?</p>
<p>And there were times because society</p>
<p>is desperately biased towards the morning types.</p>
<p>This notion of the early bird catches the worm.</p>
<p>Maybe that&rsquo;s true, but I&rsquo;ll also tell you</p>
<p>that the second mouse gets the cheese.</p>
<p>Yeah, so I think one of the issues around,</p>
<p>firstly, people don&rsquo;t really understand chronotype</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ll have some people</p>
<p>when I&rsquo;m sort of out in the public,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll say, look, I struggle with terrible insomnia.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll ask them, is it problems falling asleep</p>
<p>or staying asleep?</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ll say, falling asleep.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;ll say, look, if you are on a desert island</p>
<p>with nothing to wake up for, no responsibilities,</p>
<p>what time would you normally go to bed</p>
<p>and what time would you wake up?</p>
<p>And they would say, I&rsquo;d probably like to go to bed</p>
<p>about midnight and wake up maybe eight in the morning.</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;d say, so what time do you now go to bed?</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;d say, well, I&rsquo;ve got to be up for work early.</p>
<p>So I get into bed at 10.</p>
<p>I say, well, you don&rsquo;t have insomnia.</p>
<p>You have a mismatch between your biological chronotype</p>
<p>and your current sleep schedule.</p>
<p>And when you align those two,</p>
<p>and I was fighting that for some time too,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m probably mostly right in the middle.</p>
<p>I am desperately vanilla, unfortunately,</p>
<p>in many aspects of life, but this included,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m neither a strong morning type</p>
<p>nor a strong evening type.</p>
<p>So ideally I&rsquo;d probably like to go to bed around 11,</p>
<p>10.30, 11, probably somewhere between 10.30, 11,</p>
<p>and wake up, I naturally wake up usually most days</p>
<p>before my alarm at 7.04, and it&rsquo;s 7.04</p>
<p>because why not be idiosyncratic</p>
<p>in terms of setting an alarm?</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>And so I&hellip;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s kind of awesome.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never heard about that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna start doing that now,</p>
<p>setting alarms like a little bit off the&hellip;</p>
<p>Yeah, I know.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m never quite sure why we all&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a celebration of uniqueness.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I am quite the odd snowflake in that sense too.</p>
<p>So I would usually then try to force myself</p>
<p>because I had that same mentality</p>
<p>that if I wasn&rsquo;t up at 6.30 and in the gym by seven</p>
<p>that there was something wrong with me.</p>
<p>And I quickly abandoned that.</p>
<p>But if I look back, if there was a shameful act</p>
<p>that I have around my sleep,</p>
<p>I think it would be that for some years</p>
<p>until I really started to get more detailed into sleep.</p>
<p>And now I have no shame in telling people</p>
<p>that I will probably usually wake up around 6.45 naturally,</p>
<p>sometimes seven when people are looking at me thinking,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re a sloth, you&rsquo;re lazy.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t finish my daily workout</p>
<p>until I&rsquo;m not working until probably nine o clock</p>
<p>in the morning thinking, what are you doing?</p>
<p>Now I will work late into the day.</p>
<p>If I could, I would work 16 hours.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s my passion just like yours.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t feel shame around that,</p>
<p>but I have changed my mentality around that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s complicated because I&rsquo;m probably happiest</p>
<p>going to bed, if I&rsquo;m being honest, like at 5 a.m.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just an extreme evening type.</p>
<p>But the problem is it&rsquo;s not that I&rsquo;m ashamed for it.</p>
<p>I actually kind of enjoy it because I get to sleep</p>
<p>through all the nonsense of like the morning.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t that a beautiful thing?</p>
<p>Like people are busy with their emails</p>
<p>and I just am happy as a cow.</p>
<p>And I wake up after all the drama has been resolved.</p>
<p>And cows are happy and the drama has been resolved.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>But in society you do, especially,</p>
<p>I mean this is what I think about is</p>
<p>when you work on a larger team,</p>
<p>especially with companies, you are,</p>
<p>everybody&rsquo;s awake at the same time.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s definitely been a struggle</p>
<p>to try to figure out, just like you said,</p>
<p>how to balance that, how to fit into society</p>
<p>and yet be optimal for your chronotype, you said.</p>
<p>Yeah, you have to sleep in synchrony with it and harmony.</p>
<p>Because normally what we know is that if you fight biology,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll normally lose.</p>
<p>And the way you know you&rsquo;ve lost is through disease</p>
<p>and sickness.</p>
<p>You said you suffered through several bouts of insomnia.</p>
<p>Is there, aside from embracing your chronotype,</p>
<p>is there advice you can give how to overcome insomnia</p>
<p>from your own experience?</p>
<p>Right now the best method that we have</p>
<p>is something called cognitive behavioral therapy</p>
<p>for insomnia or CBTI for short.</p>
<p>And you work with, for people who don&rsquo;t know what it is,</p>
<p>you work with a therapist for maybe six weeks</p>
<p>and you can do it online, by the way,</p>
<p>I recommend probably jumping online, it&rsquo;s just the easiest.</p>
<p>And it will change your beliefs, your habits,</p>
<p>your behaviors and your general stress</p>
<p>around this thing called sleep.</p>
<p>And it is just as effective as sleeping pills</p>
<p>in the short term.</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s great is that unlike sleeping pills,</p>
<p>when you stop working with your therapist,</p>
<p>those benefits last for years later.</p>
<p>Whereas when you stop your sleeping pills,</p>
<p>you typically have what&rsquo;s called rebound insomnia,</p>
<p>where your sleep not only goes back to being</p>
<p>as bad as it was before, it&rsquo;s usually even worse.</p>
<p>For me, I think I found a number of things effective.</p>
<p>The first is that I had to really address</p>
<p>what was stressful and try to come up with</p>
<p>some degree of meaningful rationality around it.</p>
<p>Because I think one of the things that happens,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something very, talking about conscious states,</p>
<p>to come all the way back to, gosh, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>I feel like we&rsquo;ve only been chatting for like 20 minutes,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re gonna tell me it&rsquo;s been a while.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s been a while.</p>
<p>Okay, I&rsquo;m desperately, I feel terribly sorry.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s come back to conscious states,</p>
<p>which is where we started.</p>
<p>There is something very strange about the night</p>
<p>that thoughts and anxieties are not the same</p>
<p>as they are in the waking day.</p>
<p>They are worse, they are bigger.</p>
<p>And I at least find that I am far</p>
<p>more likely to catastrophize and ruminate</p>
<p>at night about things that when I wake up the next day</p>
<p>in the broad light of day,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s nowhere near that bad, man.</p>
<p>What were you doing?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that bad at all.</p>
<p>So to gain firstly, some rational understanding</p>
<p>of my emotional state that&rsquo;s causing that insomnia</p>
<p>was very helpful.</p>
<p>The second thing was to keep regularity,</p>
<p>just going to bed at the same time waking up.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s an unconventional piece of sleep advice.</p>
<p>After a bad night of sleep, do nothing.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t wake up any later, don&rsquo;t go to bed any earlier,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t nap during the day,</p>
<p>and don&rsquo;t drink any more coffee than you would otherwise.</p>
<p>Because if you end up sleeping later into the morning,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re then not going to be tired</p>
<p>at your normal time at night.</p>
<p>So then you&rsquo;re gonna get into bed thinking,</p>
<p>well, I had a terrible night of sleep last night.</p>
<p>And yes, I slept in this morning to try and compensate,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m still gonna get to bed at my normal time.</p>
<p>But now you get into bed and you haven&rsquo;t been awake</p>
<p>for as long as you normally would.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re not as sleepy as you normally would be.</p>
<p>And so now you sit there lying in bed</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s another bad night.</p>
<p>And the same thing is, if you go to bed any earlier,</p>
<p>so don&rsquo;t wake up any later, wake up at the same time,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t go to bed any earlier,</p>
<p>because then you&rsquo;re just probably your chronotype,</p>
<p>your biological rhythm doesn&rsquo;t want you to be asleep.</p>
<p>And you think, well, it&rsquo;s a terrible night,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna get into bed at 9 p.m.</p>
<p>rather than my standard 10,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just gonna be lying in bed awake for that hour.</p>
<p>Naps will take our double edged sword,</p>
<p>they can have wonderful benefits.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve done lots of studies on naps</p>
<p>for both the brain and the body.</p>
<p>But they are a double edged sword in the sense that</p>
<p>napping will just take the edge off your sleepiness.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little bit like a valve on a pressure cooker.</p>
<p>When you nap during the day,</p>
<p>you can take some of that healthy sleepiness</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve been building up during the day.</p>
<p>And for some people, not all people,</p>
<p>but for some people that can then make it harder</p>
<p>for them to fall asleep at night</p>
<p>and then stay asleep soundly across the night.</p>
<p>So the advice would be,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re struggling with sleep at night,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t nap during the day.</p>
<p>But if you are not struggling with sleep,</p>
<p>and you can nap regularly, naps are just fine.</p>
<p>And we can play around with optimal durations</p>
<p>depending on what you want.</p>
<p>Just try not to nap too late into the day</p>
<p>because napping late into the day</p>
<p>is like snacking before your main meal.</p>
<p>It just takes the edge off your sleep hunger as it were.</p>
<p>But that would be, so that&rsquo;s my unconventional</p>
<p>second piece of advice regarding insomnia.</p>
<p>The third is meditation.</p>
<p>I found meditation to be incredibly powerful.</p>
<p>I started reading about meditation</p>
<p>as I was researching that aspect of the book many years ago.</p>
<p>And as a hard nose scientist,</p>
<p>I thought this sounds very woo woo.</p>
<p>This is sort of, we all hold hands and sing come by hour</p>
<p>and everything&rsquo;s going to be fine with sleep.</p>
<p>I read the data and it was compelling.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t ignore it.</p>
<p>And I started meditating and that was six years ago</p>
<p>and I haven&rsquo;t stopped.</p>
<p>And I find meditation before bed incredibly powerful.</p>
<p>The meditation app companies were perplexed at this at first.</p>
<p>They want people to meditate during the day.</p>
<p>But when they looked at their usage statistics,</p>
<p>they found that they would have people</p>
<p>in the morning meditating.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s a huge number of people</p>
<p>using the meditation app in the evening.</p>
<p>What they were doing was self medicating their insomnia.</p>
<p>And they finally, rather than railing against it,</p>
<p>they started to see it as a cash cow, rightly so.</p>
<p>So I found meditation to be helpful.</p>
<p>Having a wind down routine</p>
<p>is the other thing that&rsquo;s critical for me.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t just go from,</p>
<p>because when my mind is switched on</p>
<p>and I think you may be like this too,</p>
<p>if I get into bed, that Rolodex of thoughts</p>
<p>and information and excitement and anxiety and worry</p>
<p>is just whirling away.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not gonna be a good night for me.</p>
<p>So I have to find a wind down routine.</p>
<p>And that makes sense when you realize what sleep is like.</p>
<p>Sleep is not like a light switch.</p>
<p>Sleep is much more like trying to land a plane.</p>
<p>You know, it takes time to descend down</p>
<p>onto the terra firma that we call sound sleep at night.</p>
<p>And we have this for kids.</p>
<p>You know, I don&rsquo;t have children,</p>
<p>but you know, a lot of parents will say,</p>
<p>you know, we have to have the bedroom,</p>
<p>sorry, the bedtime routine.</p>
<p>You know, you bathe the kid, you put them in bed,</p>
<p>you read them a story.</p>
<p>You have to go through this routine,</p>
<p>this wind down routine for them.</p>
<p>And then they fall asleep wonderfully.</p>
<p>Why do we abandon that?</p>
<p>As adults, we need that same wind down routine.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s been the other thing</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s been very helpful to me.</p>
<p>So don&rsquo;t do anything different.</p>
<p>If you have a bad night of sleep,</p>
<p>keep doing the same thing.</p>
<p>Manage your anxiety, understand it, rationalize it.</p>
<p>Then meditation, and then finally having</p>
<p>some kind of disengagement wind down routine.</p>
<p>Those are the four things that have been very helpful to me.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s brilliant.</p>
<p>So the regularities really do a lot of work against insomnia.</p>
<p>Is there,</p>
<p>is it possible to have a healthy sleep life</p>
<p>without the regularities?</p>
<p>I say that because I&rsquo;m all over the place</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve gotten good at being all over the place.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll often, like what happens,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll go stretches of time.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;ll be sometimes a month where I,</p>
<p>my days are like, this is embarrassing to admit,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>just you and I here, just you and I.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like 28 hours or 30 hour days.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;ll just go all the way around</p>
<p>comfortably and happily, I love it.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;ll be a nap.</p>
<p>I mean, if you like add up the hours</p>
<p>when I&rsquo;m just like sleeping as much as I want,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;d probably be like six hour average per 24 hours.</p>
<p>Like that kind of, so it works out nicely,</p>
<p>maybe even seven hours, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>But that it&rsquo;s obviously irregular</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s chaos in the whole thing.</p>
<p>Like sometimes it&rsquo;s shorter sleep,</p>
<p>sometimes it&rsquo;s longer.</p>
<p>Is that totally not a good thing, do you think?</p>
<p>The best evidence that we have to speak to this question</p>
<p>is people who are doing rotating shifts.</p>
<p>And unfortunately the news is not good.</p>
<p>They usually have a higher instance of many diseases</p>
<p>such as depression, diabetes, cardiovascular disease,</p>
<p>obesity, stroke.</p>
<p>And again, that&rsquo;s just me communicating the data</p>
<p>that we have and I&rsquo;m not telling you</p>
<p>that you should do anything different.</p>
<p>The other thing is that there&rsquo;s nothing in your biology</p>
<p>that suggests that that&rsquo;s how your body was designed</p>
<p>to sleep.</p>
<p>It is a system that loves habit.</p>
<p>You know, if your circadian clock in your brain,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s called the suprachiasmatic nucleus,</p>
<p>sits in the middle of your brain, had a personality trait,</p>
<p>it would be a creature of habit.</p>
<p>It loves habit.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how your biology is designed to work</p>
<p>is through very archetypal prototypical expected cycles.</p>
<p>And when we do something different to that,</p>
<p>then you start to see some of the pressure stress fractures</p>
<p>in the system.</p>
<p>But again, to your point, if that&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>that you don&rsquo;t mind, you know, adopting and understanding</p>
<p>and then I think you should keep doing</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s complicated.</p>
<p>Of course you have to be a student of your own body</p>
<p>and explore it.</p>
<p>One of the reasons I want to have kids</p>
<p>is kids enforce a stricter schedule.</p>
<p>I think I definitely feel that I&rsquo;m not living</p>
<p>the sort of data wise, scientifically speaking,</p>
<p>the optimal life.</p>
<p>And me just living the way I want to live day to day</p>
<p>is perhaps not the optimal way.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s certain things that I&rsquo;ve seen</p>
<p>very successful people that I know in my life</p>
<p>when they get, when they have kids,</p>
<p>they actually, the productivity goes up,</p>
<p>they get their shit together.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of aspects that, yeah, the regularity.</p>
<p>I mean, that creatures a habit.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the thing that&rsquo;s power.</p>
<p>And then you start to optimally use the hours</p>
<p>that you have in the day.</p>
<p>Let me ask you about that.</p>
<p>Well, actually, I just have one quick point on that too.</p>
<p>You know, we often think about sleep as a cost,</p>
<p>but instead I think of sleep as an investment.</p>
<p>And the reason is because your effectiveness</p>
<p>and your efficiency when you&rsquo;re well slept</p>
<p>typically exceeds that when you&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>And to me, it&rsquo;s the idea of if I&rsquo;m going to boil</p>
<p>a pot of water, why would I boil it on medium</p>
<p>when I could boil it in half the time on high?</p>
<p>And I sometimes worry that when I speak</p>
<p>to Fortune 500 companies and they&rsquo;re of this mentality</p>
<p>of longer hours, getting people to rise and grind,</p>
<p>the first point is that after about 20 hours of being awake,</p>
<p>a human being is as cognitively as impaired</p>
<p>as they would be if they were legally drunk.</p>
<p>And the reason I bring that point up</p>
<p>is because I don&rsquo;t know any company or CEO</p>
<p>who would say, I&rsquo;ve got this great team,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re drunk all the time.</p>
<p>But we often lord the airport warrior</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s flown through three different time zones</p>
<p>in the past two days, is on email at 2 a.m.</p>
<p>and then is in the office at six.</p>
<p>And I think there is some aspect, not in all people,</p>
<p>but there is sort of some aspect</p>
<p>of that slight sleep machismo.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not what you are very different.</p>
<p>You are driven by a purity of passion</p>
<p>and a very authentic, incredibly genuine goal</p>
<p>of wanting to do something remarkable with your life.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not the issue I think I&rsquo;m speaking about.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just simply that I think</p>
<p>maybe this notion of wanting to be awake for longer</p>
<p>to try and get more done can sometimes be at odds</p>
<p>with the fact that you can actually get so much more done</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re well slept.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s this trade off.</p>
<p>I actually admire people that take the big risk</p>
<p>and work hard, whether that means staying up late at night,</p>
<p>all those kinds of things,</p>
<p>but it cannot be in the framework,</p>
<p>in the context like what Edison said,</p>
<p>which is sleep feels like a waste of time.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re not sleeping</p>
<p>because you think sleep is stupid, that&rsquo;s totally wrong.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re not sleeping</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re deeply passionate about something,</p>
<p>that to me, it&rsquo;s a gray area, of course,</p>
<p>but that to me is much more admirable.</p>
<p>And everything you&rsquo;re espousing is saying</p>
<p>whatever the hell you&rsquo;re doing,</p>
<p>you better be aware that sleep,</p>
<p>long term and short term is really good for you.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re not sleeping, you&rsquo;re sacrificing,</p>
<p>just make sure you&rsquo;re sacrificing for the right thing.</p>
<p>I see vodka and getting drunk the same way.</p>
<p>I know it&rsquo;s not good for me.</p>
<p>I know I&rsquo;m not gonna feel good days after.</p>
<p>I know it&rsquo;s gonna decrease my performance.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s nothing positive about it,</p>
<p>except it introduces chaos in my life</p>
<p>that introduces beautiful experiences</p>
<p>that I would not otherwise have.</p>
<p>It creates this turmoil of social interaction</p>
<p>that ultimately makes me happy</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve experienced them in the moment</p>
<p>and later the stories, you get to meet new people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like alcohol in this society</p>
<p>is an incredible facilitator of that.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a good example of not sleeping</p>
<p>and drinking way too much vodka.</p>
<p>Again, it&rsquo;s this notion of life is to be lived to a degree.</p>
<p>But if you do have children,</p>
<p>I think one of the other things</p>
<p>that then maybe comes into the picture</p>
<p>is the fact that now there are other people</p>
<p>that you have to live for than yourself.</p>
<p>Yeah, but come on, like once they&rsquo;re old enough,</p>
<p>like if you can&rsquo;t defend for yourself,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re too weak, get stronger.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna be that kind of fatherhood.</p>
<p>I got it, I&rsquo;m understanding so much more</p>
<p>about Lex Freeman than I did before.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why you have to have for me,</p>
<p>that would be my wife would be probably softer.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s good cop, bad cop, because I think I&rsquo;m.</p>
<p>But of course, actually, because I don&rsquo;t have kids,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen some tough dudes when they have kids</p>
<p>become like the softies.</p>
<p>They become like, they do everything for their kids.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s become like, it&rsquo;s totally transforms their life.</p>
<p>I mean, Joe Rogan is an example of that.</p>
<p>I just seen so many tough guys completely become changed</p>
<p>by having kids, which is fascinating to watch</p>
<p>because it just shows you how meaningful having kids is</p>
<p>for a lot of people.</p>
<p>Although I would say having chatted with Joe for some time,</p>
<p>I think he is a delightful,</p>
<p>sweetheart, independent of children.</p>
<p>I think, don&rsquo;t get me wrong,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna be in a ring with him.</p>
<p>He would face me five ways till Tuesday,</p>
<p>but I think he&rsquo;s a desperately sweet man</p>
<p>and a very, very smart individual.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, but he talks about the compassion he&rsquo;s gained</p>
<p>from realizing just watching kids grow up</p>
<p>that we were all kids at some point,</p>
<p>you get a new perspective.</p>
<p>I think just like me, I still get this with him.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s super competitive and there&rsquo;s a certain way</p>
<p>to approach life.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re striving to do great things</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re competitive against others</p>
<p>and that intensity of that aggression,</p>
<p>that can lack compassion sometimes and empathy.</p>
<p>And when you have children, you get a sense like,</p>
<p>oh, everybody was a child at some point,</p>
<p>everybody was a kid.</p>
<p>And you see that whole development process.</p>
<p>It can definitely enrich,</p>
<p>expand your ability to be empathetic.</p>
<p>Let me ask about diet.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the connection between diet and sleep?</p>
<p>So I do intermittent fasting,</p>
<p>sometimes only one meal a day, sometimes no meals a day.</p>
<p>Is there a good science on the interaction</p>
<p>between fasting and sleep?</p>
<p>We have some data, I would prefer more,</p>
<p>but we have data both on time restricted eating</p>
<p>and then we have some data on fasting to a degree.</p>
<p>On time restricted eating,</p>
<p>I think that it has some benefits,</p>
<p>although the human replication studies</p>
<p>have actually not borne out</p>
<p>quite the same health benefit extent</p>
<p>that the animal studies have.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;ve been some disappointing studies,</p>
<p>one here close to where we are right now at UCSF recently.</p>
<p>So I think time restricted eating can be a good thing</p>
<p>and there are many benefits of time restricted eating.</p>
<p>Is sleep one of them?</p>
<p>No, it doesn&rsquo;t seem to be</p>
<p>because there are probably at the time</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re recording this,</p>
<p>three pretty decent studies that I&rsquo;m aware of.</p>
<p>Two out of the three were in obese individuals,</p>
<p>one out of the three were in healthy weight individuals.</p>
<p>And what they found is that time restricted eating</p>
<p>in all three of those studies</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t have any advantageous benefit to sleep.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t necessarily harm sleep,</p>
<p>but it didn&rsquo;t seem to improve it.</p>
<p>When it comes to fasting though,</p>
<p>which is a different state,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t have too many studies,</p>
<p>experimental studies with longterm fasting.</p>
<p>The best data that we have</p>
<p>is probably from religious practices</p>
<p>and probably the most data we have is during Ramadan</p>
<p>where people will fast for 29 to 30 days</p>
<p>from sunrise to sunset.</p>
<p>And under those conditions,</p>
<p>there are probably five distinct changes that we&rsquo;ve seen.</p>
<p>None of them seem to be particularly good for sleep.</p>
<p>The first is that the amount of melatonin</p>
<p>that you release, and melatonin is a hormone.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s often called the hormone of darkness</p>
<p>or the vampire hormone,</p>
<p>not because it makes you look longingly</p>
<p>at people&rsquo;s necklines,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s just because it comes out at night.</p>
<p>Melatonin signals to your brain and your body</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s dark, it&rsquo;s nighttime, and it&rsquo;s time to sleep.</p>
<p>Those individuals,</p>
<p>when they were undergoing that regimen of fasting,</p>
<p>the amount of melatonin that was released</p>
<p>and when it was released,</p>
<p>the amount of melatonin decreased</p>
<p>and when it was released came later.</p>
<p>That was the first thing.</p>
<p>The second thing was that they ended up finding it harder</p>
<p>to fall asleep as quickly as they normally would otherwise.</p>
<p>The third thing was that the total amount of sleep</p>
<p>that they were getting decreased.</p>
<p>The fourth fascinating thing</p>
<p>was that a wake promoting chemical</p>
<p>called orexin increased.</p>
<p>And this is why a lot of people will say,</p>
<p>when I&rsquo;m fasting, it feels like I can stay awake for longer</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m more alert, I&rsquo;m more active.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll come back from an evolutionary perspective</p>
<p>why we understand that to be the case.</p>
<p>And then the fourth factor is that fasting</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t decrease the amount of deep sleep</p>
<p>that seemed to be unaffected.</p>
<p>It did, however, decrease the amount</p>
<p>of REM sleep or dream sleep.</p>
<p>And we know that REM sleep dreaming</p>
<p>is essential for emotional first aid, mental health,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s critical for memory, creativity.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also critical for several hormone functions.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s when there&rsquo;s direct correlations</p>
<p>between testosterone release peaks</p>
<p>just before you go into REM sleep and during REM sleep too.</p>
<p>So REM sleep is critical.</p>
<p>But so those are the five changes that we&rsquo;ve seen.</p>
<p>None of them seem to be that advantageous for sleep.</p>
<p>But the fourth point that I mentioned,</p>
<p>which was orexin, which is this wake promoting chemical</p>
<p>and a good demonstration or a very sad demonstration</p>
<p>of its power is when it becomes very deficient in the brain</p>
<p>and it leads to a condition called narcolepsy</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re just unpredictable with your sleep.</p>
<p>So orexin when it&rsquo;s in high concentrations</p>
<p>keeps you awake when you lose it.</p>
<p>It can put you very much into a state of narcolepsy</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re sleeping a lot of the time</p>
<p>in unpredictable sleep.</p>
<p>Why on earth when you are fasting</p>
<p>would the brain release awake promoting chemical?</p>
<p>And our answer is right now is the following.</p>
<p>One of the few times that I mentioned before</p>
<p>that we see animals undergoing insufficient sleep</p>
<p>or prolonged sleep deprivation</p>
<p>is under conditions of starvation.</p>
<p>And that is an extreme evolutionary pressure.</p>
<p>And at that point, the brain will forgo some.</p>
<p>It won&rsquo;t forgo all, but it will forgo some of its sleep.</p>
<p>And the reason is so that it can stay awake for longer</p>
<p>because the sign of starvation is saying to the brain,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t find food in your normal foraging perimeter,</p>
<p>you need to stay awake for longer</p>
<p>so you can travel outside of your perimeter</p>
<p>for a further distance</p>
<p>and maybe you will find food and save the organism.</p>
<p>So in other words, when we fast,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s giving our brain this evolutionary signal</p>
<p>that you are under conditions of starvation.</p>
<p>So the brain responds by saying, oh my goodness,</p>
<p>I need to release the chemical</p>
<p>that helps the organism stay awake for longer</p>
<p>which is orexin.</p>
<p>So that they can forage for more food.</p>
<p>Now, of course, your brain from an evolutionary perspective</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t know about this thing called Safeway</p>
<p>that you could easily go to and break the fast.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s how we understand fasting.</p>
<p>And I think my dear friend, Peter Attia</p>
<p>has done a lot of work in this area too.</p>
<p>I think fasting and David Sinclair&rsquo;s brilliant work,</p>
<p>goodness me, what an individual too.</p>
<p>The work is pretty clear there</p>
<p>that time restricted eating and fasting</p>
<p>have wonderful health benefits.</p>
<p>Fasting creates this thing called hormesis,</p>
<p>just like exercise and low level stress</p>
<p>and sauna, heat, shock.</p>
<p>And hormesis is a biological process</p>
<p>I think as David Sinclair has once said,</p>
<p>in simple layman&rsquo;s terms is,</p>
<p>what doesn&rsquo;t kill you makes you stronger.</p>
<p>And I think there is certainly good data</p>
<p>that fasting and time restricted eating has many benefits.</p>
<p>Is sleep one of them?</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t seem to be, it doesn&rsquo;t seem to enhance sleep.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s interesting to understand its effects on sleep.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve fasted, it&rsquo;s a study of NF2.</p>
<p>I once fasted 72 hours and another time 48 hours.</p>
<p>And I found that I got much less sleep</p>
<p>and it was very restful though.</p>
<p>I hesitate to say this, but this is how I felt,</p>
<p>which is I needed less sleep.</p>
<p>I wonder if my brain is deceiving me</p>
<p>because it feels like I&rsquo;m getting</p>
<p>a whole extra amount of focus for free.</p>
<p>And I wonder if there&rsquo;s longterm impacts of that.</p>
<p>Because if I fast 24 hours,</p>
<p>get the same amount of calories, one meal a day,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a little bit of discomfort.</p>
<p>Like just maybe your body gets a little bit colder.</p>
<p>Maybe there&rsquo;s just, I mean, hunger.</p>
<p>But the amount of focus is crazy.</p>
<p>And so I wonder, it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a little suspicious of that.</p>
<p>I feel like I&rsquo;m getting something for free.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m the same way with sweetener,</p>
<p>like a Splendor or something.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s gotta be really bad for you, right?</p>
<p>Because why is it so tasty, right?</p>
<p>And I think, yeah, as we said before with biology,</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s a gain, there&rsquo;s often a cost too.</p>
<p>But we at least understand the biological basis</p>
<p>of what you&rsquo;re describing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that you actually don&rsquo;t need less sleep.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that this chemical is present</p>
<p>that forces you more awake.</p>
<p>And so subjectively you feel as though</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t need as much sleep because I&rsquo;m wide awake.</p>
<p>And those two things are quite different.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not as though your sleep need has decreased.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that your brain has hit the overdrive switch,</p>
<p>the overboost switch to say, we need to keep you awake</p>
<p>because food is in short supply.</p>
<p>So you mentioned during sleep, there&rsquo;s a simulation,</p>
<p>all those kinds of things for learning purposes,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s also these, you mentioned the five ways</p>
<p>in which we become psychotic in dreams.</p>
<p>What do you think dreams are about?</p>
<p>Why do you think we dream?</p>
<p>What place do we go to when we dream?</p>
<p>And why are they useful?</p>
<p>Not just the assimilation aspect,</p>
<p>but just like all the crazy visuals that we get with dreams.</p>
<p>Is there something you can speak to that&rsquo;s actually useful?</p>
<p>Like why we have such fun experiences in that dream world?</p>
<p>So one of the camps in the sleep field</p>
<p>is that dreams are meaningless,</p>
<p>that they are an epiphenomenal byproduct</p>
<p>of this thing called REM sleep from which dreams come from</p>
<p>as a physiological state.</p>
<p>So the analogy would be, let&rsquo;s think of a light bulb,</p>
<p>that the reason that you create the apparatus</p>
<p>of a light bulb is to produce this thing called light</p>
<p>in the same way that we&rsquo;ve evolved</p>
<p>to this thing called REM sleep</p>
<p>to serve whatever functions REM sleep serves.</p>
<p>But it turns out that when you create light in that way,</p>
<p>you also produce something called heat.</p>
<p>It was never the reason that you designed the light bulb,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just what happens when you create light in that way.</p>
<p>And the belief so too was that dreaming</p>
<p>was essentially the heat of the light bulb.</p>
<p>That REM sleep is critical,</p>
<p>but when you have REM sleep with a complex brain like ours,</p>
<p>you also produce this conscious epiphenomenon called dreaming.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe that for a second.</p>
<p>And from a simple perspective is that I suspect</p>
<p>that dreaming is more metabolically costly</p>
<p>as a conscious experience than not dreaming.</p>
<p>So you could still have REM sleep,</p>
<p>but absent the conscious experience of dreaming</p>
<p>was probably less metabolically costly.</p>
<p>And whenever mother nature burns the energy unit</p>
<p>called ATP, which is the most valuable thing,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s usually a reason for it.</p>
<p>So if it&rsquo;s more energetically demanding,</p>
<p>then I suspect that there is a function to it.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve now since discovered that dreams have a function.</p>
<p>The first, as we mentioned, creativity.</p>
<p>The second is that dreams provide a form</p>
<p>of overnight therapy.</p>
<p>Dreaming is a form of emotional first aid.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s during dream sleep at night</p>
<p>that we take these difficult, painful experiences</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve had during the day, sometimes traumatic,</p>
<p>and dream sleep acts almost like a nocturnal soothing balm.</p>
<p>And it sort of just takes the sharp edges</p>
<p>off those difficult, painful experiences</p>
<p>so that you come back the next day</p>
<p>and you feel better about them.</p>
<p>And so I think in that sense, dreaming,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not time that heals all wounds.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s time during dream sleep</p>
<p>that provides emotional convalescence.</p>
<p>So dreaming is almost a form of emotional windscreen wipers.</p>
<p>And I think, and by the way, it&rsquo;s not just that you dream.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s what you dream about that also matters.</p>
<p>So for example, scientists have done studies</p>
<p>with learning and memory</p>
<p>where they have people learn a virtual maze.</p>
<p>And what they discovered was that those people</p>
<p>who then dreamed, but dreamed of the maze</p>
<p>were the only ones who, when they woke up,</p>
<p>ended up being better at navigating the maze.</p>
<p>Whereas those people who dreamed,</p>
<p>but didn&rsquo;t dream about the maze itself,</p>
<p>they were no better at navigating the maze.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not just that you,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not sort of necessary, but not sufficient.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s necessary that you dream,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not sufficient to produce the benefit.</p>
<p>You have to be dreaming about certain things itself.</p>
<p>And the same is true for mental health.</p>
<p>What we&rsquo;ve discovered is that people</p>
<p>who are going through a very difficult experience,</p>
<p>a trauma, for example, a very painful divorce,</p>
<p>those people who are dreaming, but dreaming</p>
<p>of that difficult event itself,</p>
<p>they go on to gain resolution</p>
<p>to their clinical depression one year later.</p>
<p>Whereas people who were dreaming just as much,</p>
<p>but not dreaming about the trauma itself,</p>
<p>did not go on to gain as much clinical resolution</p>
<p>to their depression.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s, I think to me, those are the lines of evidence</p>
<p>that tell me dreaming is not epiphenomenal.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not just about the act of dreaming,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s about the content of the dreams,</p>
<p>not just the fact of a dream itself.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, first of all, it&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>It makes a lot of sense,</p>
<p>but then immediately takes my mind to,</p>
<p>from an engineering perspective,</p>
<p>how that could be useful in, for example, AI systems of,</p>
<p>if you think about dreaming as an important part</p>
<p>about learning and cognition and filtering previous memories</p>
<p>of what&rsquo;s important, integrating them.</p>
<p>You know, maybe you can correct me,</p>
<p>but I see dreaming as a kind of simulation of worlds</p>
<p>that are not constrained by physics.</p>
<p>So like you get a chance to take some of your memories,</p>
<p>some of your thoughts, some of your anxieties,</p>
<p>and play with them, like construct virtual worlds</p>
<p>and see how it evolves.</p>
<p>Like to play with those worlds</p>
<p>in a safe environment of your mind, safe in quotes,</p>
<p>because you could probably get into a lot of trouble</p>
<p>with the places your mind will go.</p>
<p>But this definitely is applied in much cruder ways</p>
<p>in artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>So one context in which this is applied</p>
<p>is the process called self play,</p>
<p>which is a reinforcement learning</p>
<p>where agents play against itself or versions of itself.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s all simulated of trying different versions</p>
<p>of themselves and playing against each other</p>
<p>to see what ends up being a good.</p>
<p>The ultimate goal is to learn a function</p>
<p>that represents what is good and what is not good</p>
<p>in terms of how you should act in the world.</p>
<p>You create a set of decision weights based on experience,</p>
<p>and you constantly update those weights</p>
<p>based on ongoing learning.</p>
<p>But the experience is artificially created</p>
<p>versus actual real data.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a crude approximation of what dreams are,</p>
<p>which is you&rsquo;re hallucinating a lot of things</p>
<p>to see which things are actually.</p>
<p>No, I think it&rsquo;s been a theory that&rsquo;s been put forward,</p>
<p>which is that dreaming is a virtual reality test space</p>
<p>that is largely consequence free.</p>
<p>What an incredible gift to give a conscious mind</p>
<p>to each and every night.</p>
<p>Now the conscious mind, the human mind</p>
<p>is very good at constructing dreams</p>
<p>that are nevertheless useful for you.</p>
<p>Like they&rsquo;re wild and crazy,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re such that they are still grounded in reality</p>
<p>to a degree where anything you learn in dreams</p>
<p>might be useful in reality.</p>
<p>This is a very difficult thing to do</p>
<p>because it requires a lot of intelligence,</p>
<p>it requires consciousness.</p>
<p>This has been effectively recently being used</p>
<p>in a self supervised learning for computer vision</p>
<p>with the process of what&rsquo;s called data augmentation.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a very crude version of dreams,</p>
<p>which is you take data and you mess with it</p>
<p>and you start to learn how a picture of a cat</p>
<p>truly represents a cat by messing with it in different ways.</p>
<p>Now the crude methods currently are cropping, rotating,</p>
<p>distorting, all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>But you can imagine much more complicated</p>
<p>generative processes that start hallucinating different cats</p>
<p>in order for you to understand deeply of what it means</p>
<p>for something to look like a cat.</p>
<p>What is the prototype of a archetype of a cat?</p>
<p>Yeah, the archetype.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s a very difficult process for computer vision</p>
<p>to go from what are the pixels</p>
<p>that are usually associated with a cat</p>
<p>to like, what is a cat in the visual space?</p>
<p>In the three dimensional visual spaces projected on an image,</p>
<p>on a two dimensional image, what is a cat?</p>
<p>Those are like fundamentally philosophical questions</p>
<p>that we humans don&rsquo;t know the answer to,</p>
<p>like linguistically.</p>
<p>But when we look at a picture of a cat and a dog,</p>
<p>we can usually tell pretty damn well what&rsquo;s the difference.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know what that is because you can&rsquo;t reduce that</p>
<p>to pointy ears or non pointy ears,</p>
<p>furry or not furry, something about the eyes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a long standing issue in cognitive science,</p>
<p>cognitive neuroscience too,</p>
<p>is how does the brain create an archetype?</p>
<p>How does it create schemas that have general applicability,</p>
<p>but yet still obtain specificity?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a very difficult challenge.</p>
<p>I mean, we can do it, we do it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s rather bloody amazing.</p>
<p>And it seems like part of the toolbox</p>
<p>is this controlled hallucination, which is dreams.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s a relaxing of the rigid constraints.</p>
<p>I often think of dreaming as,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s from an information processing standpoint,</p>
<p>the prison guards are away</p>
<p>and the prisoners are running a mock in a delightful way.</p>
<p>And part of the reason is because when you go</p>
<p>into dream sleep, the rational part of your brain</p>
<p>called the prefrontal cortex, which is the part,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like the CEO of the brain.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very good at making high level, rational,</p>
<p>top down decisions and controlled actions.</p>
<p>That part of the brain is shut down during REM sleep.</p>
<p>But then emotional centers, memory centers,</p>
<p>visual centers, motoric centers,</p>
<p>all of those centers actually become more active.</p>
<p>In fact, some of them are more active</p>
<p>than when we&rsquo;re awake in the dream state.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>So your brain from a neural architecture perspective</p>
<p>is radically different.</p>
<p>Its network feature is not the same as wakefulness.</p>
<p>And I think this is an immensely beneficial thing</p>
<p>that we have at least two different rational</p>
<p>and irrational conscious states</p>
<p>that we do information processing in.</p>
<p>The rational, the veritical,</p>
<p>the page one of the Google search is wakefulness.</p>
<p>The more irrational, illogical, hyper associative</p>
<p>Google page 20 is the REM sleep.</p>
<p>Both I think are critical, both are necessary.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>And again, fascinating to see how that could be integrated</p>
<p>in the machines to help them learn better</p>
<p>and to reason better.</p>
<p>And in some ways we also know it</p>
<p>from a chemical perspective too.</p>
<p>When you go into dream sleep,</p>
<p>it is a neurochemical cocktail like no other</p>
<p>that we see at the rest of the 24 hour state.</p>
<p>There is a chemical called noradrenaline</p>
<p>or norepinephrine in the brain.</p>
<p>And you know of its sister chemical</p>
<p>in the body called adrenaline.</p>
<p>But upstairs in the brain, noradrenaline</p>
<p>is very good at creating a very hyper focused,</p>
<p>attentive, narrow, it&rsquo;s sort of very convergent way</p>
<p>of thinking to a point, sharp focus, that&rsquo;s the only thing.</p>
<p>The spotlight of consciousness is very narrow.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s noradrenaline.</p>
<p>When you remove noradrenaline,</p>
<p>then you go from a high SNR, a high signal to noise ratio</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s just you and I in this moment,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even know what&rsquo;s going on elsewhere.</p>
<p>I am with you, noradrenaline is present.</p>
<p>But when you go into REM sleep,</p>
<p>it is the only time during the 24 hour period</p>
<p>where your brain is devoid of any noradrenaline,</p>
<p>it is completely shut off.</p>
<p>And so the signal to noise ratio is very different.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost as though we&rsquo;re injecting</p>
<p>a greater amount of noise into the neural architecture</p>
<p>of the brain during dream sleep,</p>
<p>as if it&rsquo;s chemically brute forced</p>
<p>into this relaxed associative memory processing state.</p>
<p>And then from an anatomical perspective,</p>
<p>just as I described, the prefrontal cortex goes down</p>
<p>and other regions light up.</p>
<p>So it is a state that seems to be very,</p>
<p>I mean, if you were to show me a brain scan of REM sleep</p>
<p>and tell me that it&rsquo;s not REM sleep,</p>
<p>just say, look, based on the pattern of this brain activity,</p>
<p>what would you say is going on in this person&rsquo;s mind?</p>
<p>I would say, well, they&rsquo;re probably not rational.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re probably not having logical thought</p>
<p>because their prefrontal cortex is down.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re probably feeling very emotional</p>
<p>because their amygdala is active,</p>
<p>which is an emotional center of the brain.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re definitely going to be thinking visually</p>
<p>because the back of the brain is lit up, the visual cortex.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably going to be filled with past experience</p>
<p>and autobiographical memories</p>
<p>because their memory centers are lighting up.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s probably going to be movement</p>
<p>because their motor cortex is very active.</p>
<p>That to me sounds very much like a dream.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s exactly what we see in brain scanners</p>
<p>when we&rsquo;ve put people inside of them.</p>
<p>One of the things I notice sleep affects</p>
<p>is my ability to see the beauty in the world.</p>
<p>So what do you think is the connection</p>
<p>between sleep and your emotional life,</p>
<p>your ability to love other human beings and love life?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think it&rsquo;s very powerful and strong.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve done a lot of work in the field</p>
<p>of sleep and emotion and sleep and moods.</p>
<p>And you can separate your emotions into two main buckets,</p>
<p>positive and negative.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s interesting is that when you are sleep deprived</p>
<p>and the more hours that you go into being awake</p>
<p>and the fewer hours that you&rsquo;ve had to sleep,</p>
<p>your negative mood starts to increase.</p>
<p>And we know which individual types</p>
<p>of emotions are changing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got a wonderful postdoc in my lab</p>
<p>called Etty Ben Simon, who&rsquo;s doing some incredible work</p>
<p>on trying to understand the emotional,</p>
<p>individual emotional tapestry of affective,</p>
<p>meltdown when you&rsquo;re not getting sufficient sleep.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s just keep with two dimensions,</p>
<p>positive and negative.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Most people would think, well, it&rsquo;s the negative</p>
<p>that takes the biggest hit when I&rsquo;m sleep deprived.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>By probably in a log order, magnitude larger</p>
<p>is a hit on your positive emotions.</p>
<p>In other words, you stop being sleep deprived</p>
<p>of positive emotions, in other words, you stop gaining</p>
<p>pleasure from normally pleasurable things.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a state that we call anhedonia.</p>
<p>And anhedonia is the state that we often call depression.</p>
<p>So depression to most people&rsquo;s surprise isn&rsquo;t necessarily</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re always feeling negative emotions.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s often more about the fact that you lose the pleasure</p>
<p>in the good things in life.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what we call anhedonia.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what we see in sleep, an insufficient sleep.</p>
<p>And it happens quite quickly.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s kind of fascinating.</p>
<p>I think I do, it&rsquo;s not depression,</p>
<p>but like it&rsquo;s a stroll into that direction,</p>
<p>which is when I&rsquo;m sleep deprived,</p>
<p>I stop being able to see the meaning in life.</p>
<p>The things that gave me meanings starts to lose meaning.</p>
<p>Like it makes me realize how enjoyable everything is</p>
<p>in my life because when I start to lose it,</p>
<p>when I&rsquo;m severely sleep deprived,</p>
<p>you start to see how much life sucks when you lose it.</p>
<p>But that said, I&rsquo;m just cognizant enough</p>
<p>that sleep fixes all of that.</p>
<p>So I use those states for what they&rsquo;re worth.</p>
<p>In fact, I personally like to pay attention to the things</p>
<p>that bother me in doing that time.</p>
<p>Cause they also reveal important information to me.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>I have to use like a Rorschach to, yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s, so I find this when I fast combine</p>
<p>with sleep deprivation, I&rsquo;m clear to see with people,</p>
<p>clear and identifying the things</p>
<p>that are not going right in my life</p>
<p>or people that I&rsquo;m working with are not doing</p>
<p>as good of a job as they could be doing.</p>
<p>Like people that are negative in my life,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m more able to identify them.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t act on that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very bad time to act on those decisions,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m like recording that information</p>
<p>because I usually, when I&rsquo;m well rested and happy,</p>
<p>I see the beauty in everybody,</p>
<p>which can get you into trouble.</p>
<p>So you have to balance those two things.</p>
<p>But yes, it&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s irony there too, which is the fact that,</p>
<p>you know, when you&rsquo;re well rested and well slept,</p>
<p>just as you said, you see the beauty in life</p>
<p>and it sort of enlivens you</p>
<p>and sort of gives you a quality of life</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s emotionally very different.</p>
<p>Yet then we are contrasting that against the need</p>
<p>for not getting enough sleep</p>
<p>because of the beautiful things</p>
<p>that you want to accomplish in life.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t actually see them as,</p>
<p>you know, sort of completely counterintuitive</p>
<p>or paradoxical because I still think that you can strive</p>
<p>for all of the brilliant things that you are striving for,</p>
<p>to have the monumental goals,</p>
<p>the Herculean challenges that you wish to take on and solve.</p>
<p>They can still enthrall you and excite you</p>
<p>and stimulate you.</p>
<p>But because of the insufficient sleep that they can</p>
<p>or that goal can produce,</p>
<p>it will shave off the beauty of life</p>
<p>that you experience in between.</p>
<p>And again, this is just about the trade off.</p>
<p>I will say though that,</p>
<p>and this is not applicable to your circumstance,</p>
<p>we do know that insufficient sleep</p>
<p>is very strongly linked to suicide ideation,</p>
<p>suicide attempts and tragically suicide completion as well.</p>
<p>And in fact, in 20 years of studying sleep,</p>
<p>we have not been able to discover</p>
<p>a single psychiatric condition in which sleep is normal.</p>
<p>And I think that that is a profound,</p>
<p>I think it tells us so much about the role of sleep</p>
<p>as a potential causal agent in psychiatric conditions.</p>
<p>I also think it&rsquo;s a potential sign</p>
<p>that we should be using sleep as a tool</p>
<p>for the prevention of grave mental illness.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s both a cause and a solution.</p>
<p>So yeah, I mean, me personally,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve gone through a few dark periods quite recently</p>
<p>and it was almost always sleep is not the cause,</p>
<p>but sleep is the catalyst from going to a bad time</p>
<p>to a very bad time.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s definitely true.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s funny how sleep can just cure all of that.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s actually a beautiful quote</p>
<p>by an American entrepreneur called E. Joseph Kosman,</p>
<p>who once said that the best bridge</p>
<p>between despair and hope is a good night&rsquo;s sleep.</p>
<p>And I spilled quite so much ink and hundreds of pages</p>
<p>in elegantly trying to say the same thing in my book.</p>
<p>And he said it in one line and it&rsquo;s beautiful.</p>
<p>What do you think is,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve been talking about how to extend this life,</p>
<p>how to make it a good life.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been talking about love.</p>
<p>What do you think is the meaning of this whole ride?</p>
<p>Of life?</p>
<p>Of life.</p>
<p>Why do we wanna make it a good one?</p>
<p>Do you think there&rsquo;s a meaning?</p>
<p>Do you think there&rsquo;s a answer to the why?</p>
<p>For me personally,</p>
<p>I think the meaning of life is to eat,</p>
<p>is to sleep, is to fall in love, is to cry,</p>
<p>and then to die.</p>
<p>Oh, and probably race cars in between.</p>
<p>Race cars.</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s a whole topic of sex we didn&rsquo;t talk about.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s probably in there.</p>
<p>Should we do that?</p>
<p>Maybe if you&rsquo;ll have me back, I would love to do.</p>
<p>I will go around to.</p>
<p>Next time we will do another three hours on sex alone.</p>
<p>Has it been?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It has been over three hours.</p>
<p>Gosh, okay.</p>
<p>Matt, I&rsquo;m a big fan of your work.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re doing really important work.</p>
<p>Even despite all the things I&rsquo;ve been saying</p>
<p>about the madness of my own sleep schedule,</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re helping millions of people.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s an honor that you spend your valuable time with me</p>
<p>and I can&rsquo;t wait until your podcast comes out.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a huge fan of podcasts, I&rsquo;m a huge fan of you,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just an honor to know you</p>
<p>and to get a chance, hopefully in the future,</p>
<p>to work together with you.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a brilliant man and you&rsquo;re doing amazing things.</p>
<p>And I feel immensely honored to have met you,</p>
<p>to now know you, and to start calling you a friend.</p>
<p>Thank you for what you do for the world</p>
<p>and for me included.</p>
<p>Thank you, Matt.</p>
<p>Take care.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation with Matt Walker</p>
<p>and thank you to Stamps.com, Squarespace,</p>
<p>Letter Greens, BetterHelp, and Onnit.</p>
<p>Check them out in the description to support this podcast.</p>
<p>And now, let me leave you with some words</p>
<p>from Nikola Tesla, who we discussed in this podcast</p>
<p>as sleeping very few hours a night.</p>
<p>All that was great in the past was ridiculed,</p>
<p>condemned, combated, and suppressed,</p>
<p>only to emerge all the more powerfully,</p>
<p>all the more triumphantly from the struggle.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.</p>
