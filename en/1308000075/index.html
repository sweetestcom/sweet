    <p>I mean, Jason and sacks look like fucking two accountants who&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>just been fired from Lehman Brothers in 2008. Absolutely.</p>
<p>Absolutely. We&rsquo;re carrying our boxes out to the street and</p>
<p>getting a taxi. Sacks does look appropriate for his setting.</p>
<p>How long are you in DC for? Saxapill? You in and out one</p>
<p>day? What are you doing? Yeah, I&rsquo;m flying back tonight for</p>
<p>the fundraiser tomorrow morning. Oh, who&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>fundraiser with? You want to tell everybody? Big boy. Yeah,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an April Fool&rsquo;s joke. I&rsquo;m hosting a fundraiser for a</p>
<p>Democrat. Blue state. He&rsquo;s trolling everybody with his</p>
<p>blue state. Put your red tie on. Put your red tie. You ever</p>
<p>red tie with you, Sax? I wore a blue tie today. Really? Oh,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re trolling? Full troll is on. Wow. What a little what a</p>
<p>little troll artist. Alright, let&rsquo;s get started.</p>
<p>Rain man, David Sacks.</p>
<p>And instead, we open source it to the fans and they&rsquo;ve just</p>
<p>gone crazy with it. Love you guys. Queen of Kinwans. Alright</p>
<p>everybody, welcome to another episode of the All In Podcast</p>
<p>with us. Back from his Tahoe vacation, you were certainly</p>
<p>missed even though the episode was record setting. The Queen</p>
<p>of Kinwa himself, he&rsquo;ll reboot your physique with his munique.</p>
<p>Puts the mana in the kana and he&rsquo;s your pal from NorCal, the</p>
<p>Sultan of Science, David Friedberg. How you doing,</p>
<p>brother? You have a whole sequence of these things? This</p>
<p>is great. You do actually do work for this podcast? If you</p>
<p>can keep this going every week, it&rsquo;ll be amazing. I mean, I</p>
<p>just felt like getting a plugin from Unique and Kana. That was</p>
<p>my if I could get two portfolio. Okay, go. Hit Sax and</p>
<p>me. Let&rsquo;s go. Alright, well, you know that he&rsquo;s back with us</p>
<p>again. The czar of ARR, the savant of Sass. He puts the ****</p>
<p>in Asperger&rsquo;s. He&rsquo;s a sucker. He&rsquo;s a sucker for Tucker, the</p>
<p>rain man himself. David Sacks. That&rsquo;s so good. Alright, next</p>
<p>up, the dictator agitator and our frequent collaborator. He&rsquo;s</p>
<p>back to back with the SPACs, a trendsetter with his sweaters.</p>
<p>The future he can foresee a Chamath Palihapitiya. We got</p>
<p>you, everybody. It&rsquo;s not as good as David&rsquo;s, I gotta say.</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s a lot to go with Asperger&rsquo;s, Tucker. I mean, he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the material for Sax. I could have done 20 minutes. 20 minutes.</p>
<p>I could have done 20 minutes on Sax. Sax, you are, of course,</p>
<p>in DC with some star chamber thing. You, Bannon, TL, who&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>who, what, what star chamber **** are you doing in? No, I</p>
<p>spoke at a foreign policy conference today called. What&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the name of it? It&rsquo;s called Up From Chaos and sponsored by a</p>
<p>group called the American Moment and the American</p>
<p>Conservative. What did you speak about? Well, it&rsquo;s called</p>
<p>Up From Chaos because our foreign policy has been chaos</p>
<p>for the last 30 years. The United States has been in seven</p>
<p>wars. We&rsquo;ve, how many trillions have we spent on nation</p>
<p>building? We&rsquo;ve lost all of those wars. Name one war we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>won. Look at all the lives that have been lost. Thousands and</p>
<p>thousands of our soldiers. And then, you know, millions of</p>
<p>innocent people all over the world. I&rsquo;ve said it before.</p>
<p>This is what happens when the United States goes around the</p>
<p>world stampeding like a raging elephant. We need a more</p>
<p>restrained foreign policy. So, that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>articulating. I don&rsquo;t know why, what about that makes it either</p>
<p>conservative or liberal. But, you know, what we need is more</p>
<p>restraint. First of all, it&rsquo;s too much interventionism. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>too logical, right? Yeah. You know, it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s pretty</p>
<p>much everyone in this town. I mean, there&rsquo;s no lobby for</p>
<p>decreasing our involvement, right? Because I mean, the</p>
<p>military industrial complex has gotten so big and so powerful.</p>
<p>I mean, Trump did not want to start wars. It was a key piece</p>
<p>of his platform. And it did seem up until and we&rsquo;ll get into</p>
<p>this obviously, up until the gaffe from Biden 12 hours after</p>
<p>I said you weren&rsquo;t giving him the benefit of the doubt. It</p>
<p>threw me right under the bus. Biden just declared a new world</p>
<p>order. I mean, he has bought into all this. Regime change</p>
<p>with Putin. Yeah. And he said regime change. I mean, he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>bought into this liberal interventionism. Obama was much</p>
<p>better. I mean, Obama had all the right instincts. He</p>
<p>deescalated things in Ukraine. We could have had the situation</p>
<p>back in 2014. Obama pulled the plug. And he deescalated in</p>
<p>Syria. Over the over the objections of his staff. I mean,</p>
<p>the problem is, if you the Obama basically got played by the</p>
<p>staff and the establishment, because Obama was there for</p>
<p>eight years, and he knew that, you know, it was all about</p>
<p>doing the right thing. And also about the legacy and the</p>
<p>judgment that would look back on his decisions, whereas</p>
<p>everybody else is like, Well, I&rsquo;m here for this four year</p>
<p>grift, and I&rsquo;ll be back for another four years later. So,</p>
<p>you know, the more chaos, the better for a lot of those</p>
<p>people. He couldn&rsquo;t get us out of Afghanistan. Why couldn&rsquo;t he</p>
<p>get us out of Afghanistan? sack because he wanted to write he</p>
<p>got played by the general. So Ben Rhodes wrote a book, Ben</p>
<p>Rhodes was sort of one of Obama&rsquo;s right hand guys. And he</p>
<p>coined a term that stuck for called the blob, which is the</p>
<p>term for this sort of Washington foreign policy</p>
<p>establishment, all the people in the State Department, and the</p>
<p>think tanks and the sort of the journalists who love being the</p>
<p>drums of war, I mean, that whole establishment that just is</p>
<p>addicted to war. And, you know, if you read that Atlantic</p>
<p>magazine interview called the Obama doctrine, where Obama&rsquo;s</p>
<p>interviewed, he lays it out, he says, Look, there is a foreign</p>
<p>policy playbook that presidents are expected to follow. In</p>
<p>response to any provocation, any incident, you&rsquo;re supposed to</p>
<p>react in a highly militarized way. And if you don&rsquo;t, you get</p>
<p>attacked. And the generals, he wanted to get out of Afghanistan,</p>
<p>but the general started leaking against him, that it&rsquo;d be a</p>
<p>fiasco. And then, unfortunately, Obama didn&rsquo;t stick to his guns.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t want to take those political hits. It was</p>
<p>unfortunate. He really should</p>
<p>have. We&rsquo;ll get into Ukraine at the end of the show. But let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>talk a little bit about markets up top here. The US yield curve</p>
<p>inversion is upon us. Maybe you could give us CP a little primer</p>
<p>on what this means the inverted yield yield curve, and why</p>
<p>people are talking about it this week?</p>
<p>Well, I think people were talking about it. The reason</p>
<p>they were is that they believe that it predicts a recession.</p>
<p>And specifically, what they look at is the interest rate on a</p>
<p>two year bond, and an interest rate on a 10 year bond, and you</p>
<p>subtract one from the other. And when it inverts, what</p>
<p>effectively what it means is that, you know, typically, in a</p>
<p>healthy economy, you want rising interest rates over a</p>
<p>long period of time. And the reason you would want that is</p>
<p>that you are guessing that the economy will be healthy, there&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>be a nominal amount of inflation, so things will</p>
<p>tend to increase in price. And as a result of that, you need to</p>
<p>get paid more for the future than today. Right? So if you</p>
<p>want me to take 10 year risk, you need to pay me a little bit</p>
<p>more than if you want me to take two year risk. And so things</p>
<p>should go up into the right. But when all that stuff, 10</p>
<p>years out, all of a sudden, is trading for a lower yield than</p>
<p>today. What people think will happen is that, you know,</p>
<p>governments will cut interest rates massively. They tend to do</p>
<p>that in order to stimulate the economy, right to get money back</p>
<p>into the system. And they tend to do that because of a</p>
<p>recession. And so people look at the difference between the two</p>
<p>year bond and the 10 year bond, and they try to guess what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to happen. Here&rsquo;s the problem with all of this, it</p>
<p>turns out that it&rsquo;s not as correlated. As one thinks the</p>
<p>Nick, I posted this link, so you can just put it up there. But</p>
<p>a bunch of economists at the Fed actually went and you know, you</p>
<p>have access to this data, they back tested this. And what they</p>
<p>found was that there was actually a more predictive signal</p>
<p>of recessions, which is the difference between the three</p>
<p>month T bill and the 18 month T bill. And if you look at the</p>
<p>threes 18 spread, they call that the forward spread at the</p>
<p>at the Fed. That&rsquo;s actually not showing a recession at all. In</p>
<p>fact, that shows a very healthy ascent, largely taking into</p>
<p>account the fact that the Fed has told us that they&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to rip in a bunch of rate increases over the next year to</p>
<p>18 months. So what are we to do with all of this? Well, when</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s been a recession, it has typically been true that both</p>
<p>the twos 10s and the forward spread have collapsed to zero,</p>
<p>or gone negative. That&rsquo;s this inversion. It has never really</p>
<p>been the case that twos 10s inverts, while the forward</p>
<p>spread stays up, and you have a recession. In the past, we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>mentioned that when oil has these kinds of price spikes, it</p>
<p>typically forecasts a recession. So if you put all of</p>
<p>this data together, it&rsquo;s a really murky picture. So what</p>
<p>are you supposed to do? It&rsquo;s not totally clear to me. But I</p>
<p>think that the general way that I think the market is reacting</p>
<p>to this is probably inappropriate. And I&rsquo;ll tell you</p>
<p>why. And the setup, by the way, because of this</p>
<p>inappropriateness is actually quite interesting. So why is the</p>
<p>reaction inappropriate? Look, if you think about where we were</p>
<p>in November, and where we are today, almost April 1, right,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s been four months, five months, we&rsquo;ve had massive</p>
<p>exposition of inflation. We&rsquo;ve had massive disruptions to the</p>
<p>supply chain. We&rsquo;ve had the beginning of a war whose end is</p>
<p>somewhat indeterminate today. That&rsquo;s causing a bunch of spikes</p>
<p>in a bunch of really critical commodities the entire world</p>
<p>needs. We&rsquo;ve had a Federal Reserve that went from hiking</p>
<p>50 or 75 basis points to hiking 200 to 250 basis points by the</p>
<p>estimated average. And so all of these things have happened yet</p>
<p>the market is basically at an all time high, plus or minus</p>
<p>5%. That really doesn&rsquo;t hang together at some really basic</p>
<p>logical level, right? So So what&rsquo;s going to happen? Well,</p>
<p>Brad said this last week, what has actually happened under the</p>
<p>hood is a dispersion, which means the crappy companies have</p>
<p>gotten crushed. And the good companies have gotten whacked,</p>
<p>but not crushed. Okay. And then when they rally, they rally</p>
<p>disproportionately in favor of the good companies. So what are</p>
<p>we doing right now, I think we are going to see this diversion</p>
<p>of companies. And we&rsquo;re about to go through earning season,</p>
<p>right, we&rsquo;re at the end of q1. And I think what&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>happen is really interesting, you&rsquo;re going to have a handful</p>
<p>of companies who have a great handle on their business, who</p>
<p>actually project strength, I know what I&rsquo;m doing. I know how</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to perform, the levers are in my control, I&rsquo;m going to</p>
<p>invest for the future, I&rsquo;m going to go and consolidate a market,</p>
<p>those companies will get rewarded. And then anybody else</p>
<p>who has a whiff of indecision, or whose structural business is</p>
<p>flawed, and then they use all of these other issues as a reason</p>
<p>to explain their flawed business will get completely whacked. Two</p>
<p>examples over this last week, and we had this debate, you</p>
<p>know, that people were talking about restoration hardware, and</p>
<p>the CEO basically saying the sky is falling, and there&rsquo;s a huge</p>
<p>recession. And, you know, my comment is, well, if you take</p>
<p>the other side of the coin, restoration hardware sells</p>
<p>overpriced crappy furniture into a housing market that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>basically shut down, because refi rates are at 5%. There&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>other explanation for why his business is crappy. It doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>necessarily have to be a recession.</p>
<p>And just to clearly define it, a recession is two quarters or</p>
<p>more of negative growth, the economy contracting. And we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>had about a dozen of these since World War Two, we remember a</p>
<p>couple of them in our lifetimes, obviously, the COVID situation</p>
<p>created a recession for a couple of quarters. And then we had</p>
<p>the Great Recession, which lasted, I think that was almost</p>
<p>was over a year, right? That was six quarters, I think five</p>
<p>quarters. So these happen every 10 years or so. So if we do have</p>
<p>a recession, and it seems implausible to me that we would</p>
<p>have negative growth for two quarters. So the other the</p>
<p>other interesting company, for example, was UiPath, which UiPath</p>
<p>got whacked today 25 or 26%. And what they actually reported was</p>
<p>that they thought that they were going to increase ARR to, you</p>
<p>know, 1.2 billion from like 900. That&rsquo;s a that&rsquo;s a huge at that</p>
<p>scale, to grow 3540% in ARR in a year is really quite incredible.</p>
<p>But their ACV numbers and the revenue numbers were a little</p>
<p>soft, they got whacked. And now they&rsquo;re trading, you know, like</p>
<p>11 times ARR. So you have some of these companies that are</p>
<p>going to blame macro headwinds, but they may actually just have</p>
<p>a, you know, a flawed business model. You&rsquo;ll have these other</p>
<p>companies who actually overperform, but may have been a</p>
<p>little bit too highly valued, who will get valuation reset on</p>
<p>any faint weakness. And so, you know, it&rsquo;s going to be really up</p>
<p>to the CEOs and these boards when they write their earnings</p>
<p>releases. To be very precise, those that have a handle on</p>
<p>their business, I think are going to get really rewarded. And</p>
<p>those that don&rsquo;t need to blame the macro market and just get</p>
<p>all the bad news out now, because this is the quarter, it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t get any better from here.</p>
<p>sacks, best ways to fight a recession, cut spending, I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>sorry, increase government spending, cut taxes. Where are</p>
<p>we at in terms of how many bullets we have left to do these</p>
<p>kind of things? We don&rsquo;t really have a, you know, ability to</p>
<p>spend more money. And I guess lowering interest rates is the</p>
<p>other way to stimulate it. Do we even know we&rsquo;re going into a</p>
<p>recession? So do you think we&rsquo;re going into a recession? If we</p>
<p>are? Is there a way to reverse it through the the normal</p>
<p>tactics? We&rsquo;re definitely going into a slowdown. And whether it</p>
<p>becomes a recession to be determined, I think there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>very good chance because we already were headed for a</p>
<p>slowdown because of interest rate increases because of</p>
<p>inflation. And now on top of it, we got all the supply chain</p>
<p>disruptions from this war. And we know that, you know,</p>
<p>unplugging 144 million Russians in the Russian economy, we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>basically unplugged that from the global economy. So that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to hit our economy, if there&rsquo;s a little bit of a</p>
<p>delayed reaction there. So these are all negative</p>
<p>indicators. And I think we&rsquo;re either going to have a</p>
<p>recession, or something very close to it.</p>
<p>They typically last 11 months, right? So how long would the</p>
<p>recession be? I think it&rsquo;s typically 11 months, two</p>
<p>quarters, six quarters?</p>
<p>Yeah, normally, it&rsquo;s like 18 months. So you get back to where</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re supposed to be or something like that. But you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>right, we have very limited tools to fight this, because</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve already spent, I mean, we&rsquo;ve already broken the glass</p>
<p>in case of emergency for COVID. We spent something like 10</p>
<p>trillion. By the way, that&rsquo;s what caused a lot of the</p>
<p>problems is we flooded the zone with liquidity. Now we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>trying to mop that up with interest rate increases that</p>
<p>slowing down the economy. So there&rsquo;s nothing left to really</p>
<p>spend. You can&rsquo;t really drop interest rates much more. And</p>
<p>if you do, you&rsquo;ll get much worse inflation. So it seems to</p>
<p>me that we don&rsquo;t have a lot of tools here. And we could end</p>
<p>up with something like a stack 1970 style stagflation, where</p>
<p>we continue to see inflation with a slowing economy.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s unpack what that experience would be like. economy</p>
<p>slowing, there&rsquo;s less job openings, people are spending</p>
<p>less money, while the prices of goods and services continue to</p>
<p>go up.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why they spend less money. And that&rsquo;s why there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s recession. Like, I mean, you&rsquo;re paying six bucks for</p>
<p>gas, you have less money to go out for dinner every week,</p>
<p>right? You pay, you know, twice as much for an airplane ticket,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t spend as much on the hotel. I mean, like, you know,</p>
<p>the the rippling effects of the rate of inflation are decreased</p>
<p>spending. And there isn&rsquo;t enough time for, you know, the the new</p>
<p>job creation engine to catch up. And, you know, without a</p>
<p>stimulus effect, you&rsquo;re in trouble. That&rsquo;s really the</p>
<p>situation we&rsquo;re in. And that&rsquo;s what, you know, can kind of</p>
<p>cause the stagflationary effects to, to drag on</p>
<p>almost every other time we&rsquo;ve had a recession, people couldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>find jobs. And I can remember them qualitatively people</p>
<p>saying, Hey, I want to get a job, I need more money, I can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>find one. And now we&rsquo;re sitting here with more jobs than we can</p>
<p>fill still over 10 million jobs available, and people are still</p>
<p>resigning from jobs. So how do we factor in the labor market?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s all this is super confounding. It&rsquo;s not like</p>
<p>previous ones.</p>
<p>It is I actually think Jason, the explanation for all of this</p>
<p>is not necessarily about the supply demand dynamics of labor,</p>
<p>but our social policies related to our birth rate and</p>
<p>immigration. I posted this article link for you guys to</p>
<p>read in the Atlantic, but basically, our birth rate in</p>
<p>2021, absolutely fell off a cliff, it was less than 300,000</p>
<p>net births in the entire country. And net birth is</p>
<p>defined as immigration plus births minus deaths. And when</p>
<p>you look under the covers, you know, we had to really</p>
<p>discontinuously bad things, one that was, that has been</p>
<p>building since Trump and one that was acute. The thing that</p>
<p>was acute was that in 2021, after we had vaccines, which is</p>
<p>crazy thing to think about, we had a million deaths, basically,</p>
<p>right, because of COVID. So that&rsquo;s a million people that</p>
<p>largely exited the workforce, plus or minus. Obviously, some</p>
<p>not not all of those people working, but I think the</p>
<p>overwhelming majority, probably 50%, we have 50 60% of our</p>
<p>participation, more, more, more, I suspect I suspect some</p>
<p>could have been retired, right? That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m saying. I think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s probably like 70 80% of the people that died were probably</p>
<p>in the workforce in some way. So you had you had all those</p>
<p>people leave. We have a, you know, troublesome issue with</p>
<p>birth and birth rates. All Western economies do basically</p>
<p>as a standard of living goes up. And as the equality between</p>
<p>men and women go up, birth rates go down without commenting on</p>
<p>the the dynamics of that. That&rsquo;s just that is just true. And so,</p>
<p>you know, we should celebrate that in the sense that like, you</p>
<p>know, you want increasing equality, you want people to</p>
<p>have more choice, etc, all these things. So how do you make up</p>
<p>for the gap? Well, you make up for the gap in immigration. And</p>
<p>the problem is that Trump closed the door. Yeah. And Biden has</p>
<p>not reopened the door. And so you know, we have had a</p>
<p>meaningful fall off in immigration. It doubly</p>
<p>compounded because then because of COVID, we had border</p>
<p>controls, and we shut the borders completely. So even if</p>
<p>you know, you were a student that will come here, odds were</p>
<p>maybe you&rsquo;d get a master&rsquo;s or a PhD and then stay here, none of</p>
<p>those people can so nobody can get in. So that&rsquo;s the real</p>
<p>problem that we have to solve, Jason, which is that you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>going to get, you know, families to all of a sudden have kids,</p>
<p>you know, that that&rsquo;s a 18 year problem, if you started that</p>
<p>problem today to get them into the workforce or 25 year</p>
<p>problem. So immigration is really the only solution. And we</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t really have the sponsorship to do that at a</p>
<p>domestic policy level.</p>
<p>Well, then you add to that the fact that labor participation,</p>
<p>which when we were coming up 67 68% of people in the country</p>
<p>were work choosing to work. And now we&rsquo;re, we&rsquo;re down in the 60%</p>
<p>to maybe ticking up to 62% it looks like on that Fred website.</p>
<p>So we need to greatly increase the number of people in the</p>
<p>country and the people participating in the labor</p>
<p>force. If we&rsquo;re to avoid a recession, right? More people</p>
<p>working, we need more economic action. We need to boost it.</p>
<p>Yeah, I would encourage everybody to read this Atlantic</p>
<p>article, because I think Nick Thompson does a very good job of</p>
<p>just basically summarizing the issues that that we have.</p>
<p>freebird. What are your thoughts here? If is it getting</p>
<p>more people to participate in the labor force importing more</p>
<p>people both? And then how do you how do you get that to</p>
<p>actually happen?</p>
<p>Sorry, Derek Thompson, not Nick Thompson.</p>
<p>Look, I&rsquo;m not an economist, but I don&rsquo;t know if that really</p>
<p>solves the acute runaway problem that we&rsquo;re experiencing right</p>
<p>now. One thing I&rsquo;ll say about inflation, let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>running a company, and you raise your prices, you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>often going back dropping your prices again. And you know, you</p>
<p>have to have a catch up effect for income and savings to make</p>
<p>up for the increment in pricing. And that&rsquo;s really, you know, a</p>
<p>key driver right now that the rate at which prices are going</p>
<p>up, and you know, sure gas and other commodities trade back</p>
<p>down. But consumables durable typically stay high, after they</p>
<p>inflate, you end up having, you know, kind of this persisting</p>
<p>effect, and it&rsquo;s really hard to kind of just grow your way out</p>
<p>of that. So, you know, without stimulus, and so, you know, I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>not sure that the labor solution is going to solve this kind of</p>
<p>acute problem that we&rsquo;re going to be facing that that seems to</p>
<p>be dragging on.</p>
<p>What do you think about the argument, though, that there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a substitutional effect, meaning, yeah, when prices of</p>
<p>goods rise, people find cheaper goods. And then separately, what</p>
<p>happens is, you know, part of a productive society is you make</p>
<p>better and more interesting and more useful goods and services.</p>
<p>And, you know, incrementally, especially if you use technology,</p>
<p>those things tend to be deflationary. So they do get</p>
<p>cheaper, meaning, you know, you used to pay for photo storage,</p>
<p>Dropbox comes along, gives it away for free, then Google comes</p>
<p>along and gives everything away for free. Yeah. So you have this</p>
<p>deflationary natural deflationary effect where you</p>
<p>tend to save money on the things you used to pay for, because a</p>
<p>lot of people find that they can build a different kind of</p>
<p>business model to monetize giving it to you or subsidizing,</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s the key Chamath is that if people if prices go</p>
<p>up, that entrepreneurs are going to look at it, you know, there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a better way to do this. You want to go on vacation, you want</p>
<p>to stay somewhere for two weeks, you can&rsquo;t afford the hotel.</p>
<p>Okay, let&rsquo;s try this new thing like this Airbnb, somebody rent</p>
<p>you their apartment, they move in with another person. For the</p>
<p>week, you use their apartment, and you can rent for 150 night</p>
<p>instead of 350 at a hotel, that that pricing, when there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>runaway pricing, people come up with better solutions for</p>
<p>people. Yeah, I think I think that that&rsquo;s generally been true.</p>
<p>And by the way, the if you think about the the biggest areas that</p>
<p>have been sticky, which are energy policy and housing</p>
<p>policy, the way that we&rsquo;ll have to unlock better pricing in</p>
<p>those markets will be because we deregulate not not by</p>
<p>increasing regulation, but by massive deregulation, you know,</p>
<p>we have massive nimby ism up and down the stack that prevents us</p>
<p>from building the housing supply we need, that has to get fixed,</p>
<p>right. And we need to have better energy policy. Like, for</p>
<p>example, you take a state like California, you know, it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>most populous state in the country, it&rsquo;s the richest state</p>
<p>in the country, but it has an electricity prices that are</p>
<p>three times higher than the national average. That doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>make any sense. Right. And so you know, how do you expect</p>
<p>renewables to really compete? When people are still</p>
<p>incentivized to fire coal and nat gas, it doesn&rsquo;t make any</p>
<p>sense whatsoever. These prices cannot be this high, they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>high because of lobbying and because of lobbyists, and</p>
<p>special interests. And so if you rip that stuff out by</p>
<p>deregulation, you actually allow, as you said, Jason</p>
<p>entrepreneurs to do the right thing, and they will push</p>
<p>prices back down.</p>
<p>Saks, what&rsquo;s your question? Well, you might want to comment</p>
<p>on what we&rsquo;re talking about entrepreneurs creating products</p>
<p>and services that lower prices that then you know, maybe</p>
<p>create the the exit ramp here to inflation and stagflation,</p>
<p>some combination of that that&rsquo;s going to be upon us.</p>
<p>Sure. I mean, there&rsquo;s a lot of entrepreneurial energy in the</p>
<p>US, it&rsquo;s strong there, that technology does cause deflation,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s deflationary. But this is not going to help us get out of</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s coming over the next year or two. Look, the bottom</p>
<p>line is that we had a massive government overreaction to COVID</p>
<p>in which we printed and spent way too much money, something</p>
<p>like 10 trillion plus. And, you know, this is the classic</p>
<p>hangover. After the party, you know, they put the punch bowl</p>
<p>out for way too long. And now we&rsquo;re all gonna pay the price</p>
<p>for it despite the punch bowl, they spike the punch bowl big</p>
<p>time. Yeah. And we&rsquo;re already seeing it and think about like</p>
<p>all the advice we&rsquo;re giving our portfolio companies to slow</p>
<p>down their spending and extend their runway. Every board in</p>
<p>America is going to be doing that. So it becomes a</p>
<p>self-fulfilling prophecy. But this yield curve inversion is,</p>
<p>you know, fairly predictive. I mean, it&rsquo;s not perfect. But,</p>
<p>you know, CNBC had this report today, historically, it&rsquo;s met</p>
<p>when the yield curve inverts has been a better than two thirds</p>
<p>chance of recession at some point in the next year, and</p>
<p>greater than 98% chance of recession at some point in the</p>
<p>next two years. So it looks to me like</p>
<p>needs to be inverted for at least 90 days, typically. But</p>
<p>again, I think if you look at the the forward spread from the</p>
<p>Fed, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s more accurate than the two stands. But your</p>
<p>point is the same. Something is happening that we need to take</p>
<p>seriously. And none of the outcomes here are growthy good</p>
<p>outcomes. And the policy wonks in Washington, really need to</p>
<p>figure out what their position is going to be on this stuff and</p>
<p>what they push next in terms of legislation, because we&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to be going into the back half of the year in a midterm</p>
<p>election where the economy is slowing, interest rates are</p>
<p>high, prices are high. This is a horrible setup for the day.</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s think about what the priorities of the administration</p>
<p>have been throughout all of this. I mean, one year ago, they</p>
<p>did that whole $2 trillion American rescue plan, they were</p>
<p>warned by people like Stanley Druckenmiller, that retail was</p>
<p>back, the consumer was back, and yet they still printed 2</p>
<p>trillion, that caused a huge amount of inflation, it totally</p>
<p>backfired. And that wasn&rsquo;t the end of it. If they had their</p>
<p>way, we would have had 4 trillion more spending in the</p>
<p>whole bill back better. Now Biden just floated this new</p>
<p>trial balloon over this unrealized gains tax. So last</p>
<p>year, they floated the trial balloon about basically doing a</p>
<p>wealth tax. And everyone hated it. And now they just proposed</p>
<p>it again. It was insane. And even when they brought it out,</p>
<p>they leaked that they had mansion support behind it. And</p>
<p>then the next day, mansion came out and disavowed and said, No,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t support this. I mean, what is the administration</p>
<p>thinking? It makes no sense. Well, I mean, clearly foreign</p>
<p>policy. I mean, I strongly believe we could have cut a deal</p>
<p>on Ukraine a year ago, to diffuse this whole situation</p>
<p>before it turned into a war. Now we got a war over there.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about what they should do. I mean, number one on</p>
<p>the list for me is, we should be getting every entrepreneur from</p>
<p>around the world, any really intelligent person who wants to</p>
<p>go to graduate school here into this country, we need to have,</p>
<p>like, a Manhattan project to just scoop up all these mutant</p>
<p>geniuses from around the world and get them here and get them</p>
<p>starting companies here. You don&rsquo;t even need to do that. It</p>
<p>was working. I don&rsquo;t fuck it up in Bush, Obama, all you had to</p>
<p>do was just leave it alone. Everybody who was any good at</p>
<p>anything, wanted to come to the United States, including the</p>
<p>three of us. Yeah. And all of a sudden, it&rsquo;s like, Nah, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>good. Yeah, pass. Okay, I guess. Yeah. Well, I mean, if</p>
<p>you set out that you hate entrepreneurs, and you resent</p>
<p>them for success, don&rsquo;t be surprised if they want to stay</p>
<p>in a country that but I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s what it was. I</p>
<p>think it was much crueler than that. I think that we went to a</p>
<p>posture that said, Okay, you know what, net new immigration</p>
<p>was viewed as something that was displacing people wasn&rsquo;t a net</p>
<p>value creator was, you know, in some cases viewed very</p>
<p>xenophobically. And that is really problematic, because it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>actually about a large population issue. And it&rsquo;s about</p>
<p>how you construct a healthy, thriving population. Yeah, this</p>
<p>was Trump&rsquo;s worst. Yeah, worst approach. He was best approach,</p>
<p>clearly not starting wars, worst approach, shutting the borders</p>
<p>down for some populous reason when we actually need people in</p>
<p>the country. Well, hold on. But see, the way you just framed</p>
<p>that is why I think there&rsquo;s a problem, which is like,</p>
<p>obviously, the immigration is a very fraught issue. But the</p>
<p>choice that&rsquo;s being presented to us by our political parties is</p>
<p>either you&rsquo;re in favor of immigration, you know, like</p>
<p>bringing in all these superstars, like we have</p>
<p>founders in Silicon Valley, that makes sense. Or you&rsquo;re in</p>
<p>favor of open borders. I mean, why are those the two choices</p>
<p>that we either have h1 bs, or you have an open border? I mean,</p>
<p>that makes no sense. I mean, what we should have is a</p>
<p>sensible immigration, first of all, we should strip the border</p>
<p>security issue out of it. Because whatever the number of</p>
<p>immigrants,</p>
<p>everyone should be pro border security. I mean, we need a</p>
<p>point based system, we need to be have a reasonable discussion</p>
<p>between democrats and republicans about a point based</p>
<p>system. There&rsquo;s a qualitative distance for a long time, and it</p>
<p>works in Canada. And you&rsquo;re I think you&rsquo;re absolutely</p>
<p>Australian, New Zealand, UK, they all have this. It&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>what does our country need right now? Okay, do we need people?</p>
<p>You know, who are laborers? Or do we need people starting</p>
<p>companies? Do we need, you know, scientists, you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>noticed, but to me, this is very equivalent to the removal</p>
<p>of SAT and ACT scoring and admissions in college. The</p>
<p>notion of merit, the notion of performance is not one that</p>
<p>really matters in this country as much right now, as much as</p>
<p>the notion of equity. And equity really has kind of become the</p>
<p>mainstay of not just how we&rsquo;re making policy decisions on a</p>
<p>local level. But a lot of these kind of national issues are</p>
<p>becoming about equity. And it&rsquo;s about, you know, equitable</p>
<p>consideration for wealth creation for existing citizens</p>
<p>in the United States, and the perception that a minority of</p>
<p>people or some majority of people actually missed out on</p>
<p>significant wealth creation over the past couple of decades</p>
<p>as globalization and technology advances have accelerated</p>
<p>growth in our economy. And the share of that growth has been</p>
<p>disproportionately assigned to a small percentage of people.</p>
<p>And I think it is that same notion that drives a lot of the</p>
<p>kind of sub decisions, the local decisions that we&rsquo;re making,</p>
<p>as well as these important policy decisions. And the point</p>
<p>that I think is critical, it&rsquo;s really hard to get across to</p>
<p>everyone, or anyone for that matter, is that, you know, and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked about this a lot, but progress brings everyone</p>
<p>forward, but it doesn&rsquo;t bring everyone forward symmetrically,</p>
<p>right? Progress brings everyone forward, give an example,</p>
<p>Freiburg. So Amazon&rsquo;s a great example. I&rsquo;ve used it a lot.</p>
<p>With Amazon, we&rsquo;ve all been given access to more goods and</p>
<p>cheaper goods than we would have had before. So we all</p>
<p>benefit from that progress, right? Everyone can get on an</p>
<p>app and get a frigging inflatable swimming pool</p>
<p>delivered to their home and the vitamins they need within 24</p>
<p>hours at half the price of what it would have cost them to go</p>
<p>down to the local Ace hardware store. That&rsquo;s an incredible</p>
<p>benefit for all of us. So our share of wallet on that sort of</p>
<p>goods has gone down, therefore, we can spend more get access to</p>
<p>more stuff, and we&rsquo;re all prospering. And if you think</p>
<p>back to what life was like 30 years ago, 20 years ago, to</p>
<p>those of you who, you know, we&rsquo;re spending money 20 years</p>
<p>ago, or whatever, it&rsquo;s an incredibly different</p>
<p>proposition than what we had back then. And it really has</p>
<p>changed the world and changed all of us as consumers ability</p>
<p>to consume more. That&rsquo;s amazing. The problem is Jeff Bezos is</p>
<p>worth $160 billion. So everyone looks at that, and they want to</p>
<p>lambaste Jeff Bezos, and they want to say this is unfair. And</p>
<p>equity becomes the discussion, which is why is one guy worth</p>
<p>$160 billion. The reality is he benefited everyone, everyone</p>
<p>got benefit from the value that he helped create in this world</p>
<p>in this market. And then the reaction is, we got to stop</p>
<p>this from happening. We can&rsquo;t let people be worth $160</p>
<p>billion without putting their eye on the point that you know</p>
<p>what, I&rsquo;m spending three grand a year less because of this</p>
<p>possible because of this technology that he brought to</p>
<p>market. And so there&rsquo;s a lot of these solutions that I would</p>
<p>say, are progressive, they progress us all as a society,</p>
<p>everything from biotech, to technology and software to any</p>
<p>sort of business or services innovation that people are</p>
<p>willing to pay money for that people are willing to embrace</p>
<p>in an open and free market. And then what happens is the spoils</p>
<p>of that progress aggregate in a minor in a in a small way to a</p>
<p>small number of people. And that&rsquo;s the payoff in capitalism.</p>
<p>But when that happens over and over again, for 250 years, you</p>
<p>fast forward. And by the way, a lot of those compound, people</p>
<p>wake up and they say, I don&rsquo;t want that anymore. And they miss</p>
<p>the fact that progress is taken for granted. And here we are, we</p>
<p>want to give up progress, and we want to get equity. And it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to cause a real ripple effect that&rsquo;s going to last for</p>
<p>decades. And it&rsquo;s not the first time we&rsquo;ve seen it, right? This</p>
<p>has happened historically, over cycles that last hundreds of</p>
<p>years. And it&rsquo;s happening now in the United States and in the</p>
<p>entire Western world. And I think it&rsquo;s going to be really</p>
<p>unfortunate, generally for progress. And all the ones, you</p>
<p>know, all the advocates for equity are going to kind of</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the solution? I think you&rsquo;re totally right. What&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>solution? Because that&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s just a really sad. I&rsquo;ve thought</p>
<p>about this a lot. And you know, I look at what China did. And</p>
<p>everyone&rsquo;s gonna say I&rsquo;m pro China. But what was interesting</p>
<p>about China recently, is they ratchet up and they ratchet down</p>
<p>that free market system. So they allow progress, and then they</p>
<p>disallow progress when the equity meter goes the wrong way.</p>
<p>And so if you kind of think about an equity meter and a</p>
<p>progress meter, you have to balance those two over time,</p>
<p>because otherwise, what happens is you spring back, and then the</p>
<p>springing back is when governments change revolutions</p>
<p>happen, you know, democracy falls apart, autocracies arise,</p>
<p>all those sorts of awful things. And really, I would say those</p>
<p>cyclical things that happen, I don&rsquo;t want to characterize any</p>
<p>of them as good or bad, but the cyclical things that happen with</p>
<p>society over time. And so you know, that is effectively what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>happening, guys, like the ultra high tax rate, the regulatory</p>
<p>regime, you know, the government coming in and stopping</p>
<p>Facebook, I mean, these sorts of behaviors are almost like an</p>
<p>attempt to mute and ratchet down both inequity, as well as</p>
<p>the, you know, unfortunate side effect of progress. And I think</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re basically punishing excellence. And that is</p>
<p>challenging for a long term,</p>
<p>minimizing progress to improve the rate of equity of</p>
<p>distribution of gains, right. And it&rsquo;s very hard, because by</p>
<p>the way, what you&rsquo;re also doing is you&rsquo;re relating a first</p>
<p>derivative and a second derivative effect. And so, you</p>
<p>know, first order and second order effect. So it becomes a</p>
<p>really difficult thing to and people don&rsquo;t really see it this</p>
<p>way. People see kind of the very, you know, myopic view of</p>
<p>I got to redistribute wealth, I got to help people that are out</p>
<p>of jobs, these guys have only seen their income go up by 10%,</p>
<p>while everyone else&rsquo;s income has gone up by 40%. And so, you</p>
<p>know, politicians, you know, legislators react to that</p>
<p>circumstance. But the zooming out is that circumstance erodes</p>
<p>as we all made progress with respect to security, with</p>
<p>respect to health, with respect to food availability, with</p>
<p>respect to consumables, being cheaper, etc, etc, all these</p>
<p>great things that progress has given us. And, you know, there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a ratcheting effect. The hope I have is that that ratcheting</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t too binary, it doesn&rsquo;t flip too far back the other way</p>
<p>too fast, in which case you have a socialist state arise, a</p>
<p>revolution arise, you know, all the things that we&rsquo;ve seen kind</p>
<p>of come out of people just canceling AP math in</p>
<p>California, precisely, precisely. And then and then</p>
<p>the rippling effects of no more AP math and no more SATs is,</p>
<p>you know, row row, like, you know, yeah, fast forward 20</p>
<p>MIT brought back the I don&rsquo;t know if you saw this week, MIT</p>
<p>brought back SATs as a qualifier. After they paused it,</p>
<p>I think a lot of people are starting to realize this is a</p>
<p>road to nowhere. Saks, what do you think is to Chamath&rsquo;s point?</p>
<p>Like, is there a solution to get America behind excellence</p>
<p>and pragmatic, you know, kind of solutions for immigration? And</p>
<p>if there is a way to do that, how would you do it?</p>
<p>Well, I think like we&rsquo;re talking about, you got to kind</p>
<p>of unpack the issue. So like we talked about strip border</p>
<p>security out of it, don&rsquo;t make that part of it, then I think</p>
<p>you got to differentiate between high skill and low skill</p>
<p>immigration, like what you call the point system. I mean, if you</p>
<p>look at who&rsquo;s founding companies in Silicon Valley, something</p>
<p>like 40% of startups have an immigrant co founder. So</p>
<p>clearly, immigrants bring a ton of entrepreneurial energy to the</p>
<p>US. But we also, it&rsquo;s in our selfish interest to make sure</p>
<p>that the immigrants were letting in actually have the skills</p>
<p>that make them potential founders. So I think it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>would be smart for us to think that way. And you can&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>really have that conversation. It seems like today to have more</p>
<p>of a skills based immigration system. I mean, who&rsquo;s willing</p>
<p>to say that?</p>
<p>Well, you could just say three buckets, you know, here&rsquo;s</p>
<p>people who need amnesty, right? Because they&rsquo;re being</p>
<p>prosecuted, persecuted in their country. And they&rsquo;re here</p>
<p>because of humanitarian reasons. Here&rsquo;s a bucket for</p>
<p>high performers who are going to add to our economy and create</p>
<p>jobs. And then here&rsquo;s another bucket, which is a lottery and a</p>
<p>lineup system. Hey, you want to come here because you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have skill, but you want to come here because the country so</p>
<p>great, okay, you know, each of those buckets is gonna have its</p>
<p>own process. And your your odds might be different in each</p>
<p>bucket. You know, is that so hard for people to grok? Right?</p>
<p>But you know, we&rsquo;re, we&rsquo;re sitting for in the economy. I</p>
<p>mean, it&rsquo;s very easy for us to say this, because we are</p>
<p>sitting in Silicon Valley. And for us, immigration is an</p>
<p>economic good, it&rsquo;s a benefit. But if you are in a part of the</p>
<p>country or a part of the economy where you&rsquo;re in a low</p>
<p>wage job, maybe you&rsquo;re a service employee, or you&rsquo;re a</p>
<p>union employee in the Midwest, the more immigrants that are</p>
<p>let in that are low skill, they compete with you and drive your</p>
<p>wages down. And that&rsquo;s why people are against it. So</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s basically the conundrum is, as long as you&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about immigration as being a single thing, it&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>have a lot of political opposition. That&rsquo;s why we need</p>
<p>to, you know, bifurcate it between high school and low</p>
<p>skill. People and exactly less low skill, the least if you had</p>
<p>to rank them from least controversial to most</p>
<p>controversial. I think letting in high skilled labor is</p>
<p>probably the least controversial thing. Then, and</p>
<p>there is always controversy around this, it&rsquo;s always on the,</p>
<p>you know, the bucket of people for humanitarian grounds,</p>
<p>right? Some people agree, some people disagree, should these</p>
<p>people be considered refugees? Should they not? How many of</p>
<p>your family members should you be able to sponsor? How many</p>
<p>not, etc, etc. And that&rsquo;s somewhat controversial. But I</p>
<p>think we can all agree the most controversial bucket are folks</p>
<p>that would otherwise come that would be considered lower skill.</p>
<p>Because they are the ones that really put pressure in very</p>
<p>practical, measurable ways into the economy. And we just have</p>
<p>to, to your point, segregate and differentiate how we think</p>
<p>about this problem. Because again, if you take immigration,</p>
<p>the word away, and actually just use immigration as an input</p>
<p>to this equation on population stability, we have population</p>
<p>instability right now. So unless we figure out something</p>
<p>between live births and deaths, which I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to solve tomorrow, oh, it&rsquo;s going to create a very large</p>
<p>imbalance that our economy in our country cannot really</p>
<p>recover from, you know what it&rsquo;s you we spark by thinking there,</p>
<p>it really is a framing issue, we should not call high skilled</p>
<p>labor coming here. As immigration, we should be</p>
<p>flipping that to talent acquisition, we should be</p>
<p>looking at it as America is trying to get more talent here.</p>
<p>So we can win the industries that matter. And if we look</p>
<p>at it as this is talent acquisition has nothing to do</p>
<p>with immigration, this is us going out and sourcing the</p>
<p>smartest people to come here. So our companies win against</p>
<p>other companies in the global economy to create more jobs for</p>
<p>American talent acquisition could be something we could be</p>
<p>investing in, we should be thinking, how do we win that all</p>
<p>the problems that alias, the solution is in some hard working</p>
<p>group of men and women of which some will be entrepreneurs who</p>
<p>want to be here. You know, we&rsquo;re trying to figure out how to</p>
<p>actually build our own chips, while there are semiconductor</p>
<p>experts getting trained, whether here or abroad, who would want</p>
<p>to be here to do that job on behalf of the United States,</p>
<p>right? We want to figure out climate independence. There are</p>
<p>men and women being trained here and abroad, who want to be here</p>
<p>and solve that problem on behalf of the United States on and on</p>
<p>and on and on. And that&rsquo;s what it means to be and I&rsquo;ll use a</p>
<p>sports analogy, you know, the LA Lakers, right? That&rsquo;s what it</p>
<p>means to be, you know, the the New England Patriots, everybody</p>
<p>wants to play for you. And so when you&rsquo;re in that position,</p>
<p>and you have that branding tailwind, you have to use it to</p>
<p>your advantage to stack the deck in your favor so that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>constantly winning championships. Otherwise, you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>being really derelict in your duty. And I think, you know,</p>
<p>hopefully, if people look at the broad population level issue</p>
<p>that we just exposed because of COVID, there was a stat in this</p>
<p>article as an example, in the county of Los Angeles, we are</p>
<p>now in the last 20 years, we&rsquo;ve seen a 50% reduction in the</p>
<p>birth rate in LA, from 150,000 births year to about 100. And if</p>
<p>you forecast that forward, you know, before the turn of the</p>
<p>century, the county of Los Angeles will have zero net</p>
<p>births. If you run if you run if you run the that&rsquo;s insane.</p>
<p>Yeah. So we need to figure out how to solve this problem.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s a, it&rsquo;s a, it really impacts GDP, it impacts</p>
<p>all these other issues that Friedberg just talked about as</p>
<p>well, the sense of equality and fairness, if we&rsquo;re not creating</p>
<p>and growing, we are going to fight over how to split a</p>
<p>shrinking pie. And that does tend to lead to revolution.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s when people it could get really gnarly, we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not growing entrepreneurs are not coming here, new jobs are</p>
<p>not being created. Imagine if Amazon wasn&rsquo;t created, the</p>
<p>historical implications for what Friedberg said are really well</p>
<p>defined in history. If you go back 1000s of years, you look at</p>
<p>every single time, you know, an empire goes through that period</p>
<p>of decline, when they have net negative growth, economic</p>
<p>growth, and they have this sort of rising populism, what they</p>
<p>end up doing is they end up fighting. And they have</p>
<p>different ways of fighting, right, but they end up fighting</p>
<p>over how to reallocate a shrinking pie. And there are</p>
<p>many of those outcomes when they fight that ends up in, you</p>
<p>know, really turbulent moments in history.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where this wealth tax. Yeah, that&rsquo;s right. Yeah,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s where we have a responsibility to make sure you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t end up going through, you know, a Russia scenario, a China</p>
<p>scenario, you know, and there are more productive ways to</p>
<p>solve these problems.</p>
<p>Oh, that and that&rsquo;s where the wealth tax that was floated was</p>
<p>floated, which seems that&rsquo;s the DOA already. But this concept</p>
<p>of everybody having who&rsquo;s over $100 billion, having to assess</p>
<p>all their worth and give 20% back minimum each year is that</p>
<p>dividing of the pie, and they can allocate less money towards</p>
<p>can we all agree that like, you know, on the margins, when you</p>
<p>make a lot of money, you can and should pay more taxes. I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s a super controversial idea. You know, on</p>
<p>the margins, if you are a massive polluter, you should pay</p>
<p>some taxes to compensate for the damage you&rsquo;re creating to</p>
<p>the environment. These are not controversial ideas. The problem</p>
<p>is that, you know, what SAC said is true, you take a sensible</p>
<p>concept, and then you pervert it, because you have to contort</p>
<p>it with all this language to make it political, and it loses</p>
<p>all of its value in it. And so for example, you know, why does</p>
<p>the administration have to write this law, potential law or</p>
<p>proposal in a way that so obviously violates the</p>
<p>Constitution of the United States? Are they that dumb? I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;re that dumb. But they do it to appease some</p>
<p>political aspect of the Democratic Party. And then as a</p>
<p>result, it becomes do a within eight minutes of it being</p>
<p>announced mansion says this is dead. What is the point of that</p>
<p>theater? It&rsquo;s virtual signaling? Yeah. Aren&rsquo;t you a donor? You</p>
<p>should know, right? What would they tell you? I mean, what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the Democratic Party saying? What they would say off the</p>
<p>record is that these were sacrificial totems to the</p>
<p>progressive left, meaning that they do it for window dressing</p>
<p>to destroy like, it&rsquo;s like throwing a cat a ball of yarn.</p>
<p>You know, like that, that populist progressive left is</p>
<p>becoming a bigger base than it was historically.</p>
<p>In the Democratic Party, it is. Yeah, I&rsquo;m not sure how big it</p>
<p>is. But in the Democratic Party, yeah, look, it&rsquo;s where all the</p>
<p>energy is the Democratic Party. It&rsquo;s where a lot of the donors</p>
<p>are. That Yeah, that is who&rsquo;s driving the agenda in the</p>
<p>Democratic Party today. That is why the democrats are going to</p>
<p>get schlocked in November read Roy to share his substack. He</p>
<p>is the democratic political consultant who wrote the</p>
<p>emerging democratic majority predicting this is back in</p>
<ol start="2002">
<li>He wrote a book about how there would be a new democratic</li>
</ol>
<p>coalition of young voters and minorities and women, and they</p>
<p>would come together and that would create, you know,</p>
<p>democratic majorities and democratic presidents forever.</p>
<p>And then Obama wins in 2008. And it looks like to share his</p>
<p>predictions coming true. And he recently in the last two years</p>
<p>has been warning that that something&rsquo;s happened that he</p>
<p>could never have predicted, which is that working class</p>
<p>voters are now moving out of the Democratic Party, not just</p>
<p>whites, but also Hispanics and Asians, even black voters who</p>
<p>are working class are all moving to the Republican Party. So he</p>
<p>believes the Republican Party is losing its national majority.</p>
<p>Why? Because progressives have taken over and on cultural and</p>
<p>social issues, they are much more liberal than the working</p>
<p>class of this country. So basically, what&rsquo;s happened is</p>
<p>the Democrats have become a professional class party. And</p>
<p>the Republicans are in the process of transforming into a</p>
<p>working class party. And that&rsquo;s turning everything upside</p>
<p>down. But ultimately, you know, with young kid winning in</p>
<p>Virginia last year, and I think the Republicans on generic</p>
<p>ballot are up like what, plus 10 plus 12. I mean, they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to have a huge, I think, wave in November. You know,</p>
<p>you got to remember that professionals meaning college</p>
<p>educated voters are only about a third of the electorate, I</p>
<p>think about 37%. And then the other 63% are working class,</p>
<p>the working class does not like this extreme socio cultural</p>
<p>progressive agenda. They don&rsquo;t like seeing their statues rip</p>
<p>down. They don&rsquo;t like this sort of what they see as kind of this,</p>
<p>this antagonism towards American history and American</p>
<p>icons. They don&rsquo;t believe in, in socialism, you know, and so</p>
<p>on down the line. And the Democratic Party is</p>
<p>increasingly speaking only to itself. I mean, they are in an</p>
<p>echo chamber. And I think these progressives are gonna have to</p>
<p>lose a few elections before they realize, I mean, the same</p>
<p>thing happened to the Democratic Party. Back in the 1980s,</p>
<p>right, you had Ronald Reagan, and then George Herbert Walker</p>
<p>Bush win three landslide elections, 1980, 1984, 88. And</p>
<p>then five, and the Democrats nominate these like horrible</p>
<p>candidates, Jimmy Carter, Walter Mondale, Dukakis, and then</p>
<p>who comes along Bill Clinton,</p>
<p>easy on the Greeks, easy on the Greeks. Dukakis was pretty</p>
<p>great.</p>
<p>Okay, like, we found the one fan, we found the one fan.</p>
<p>Yeah, who comes along in 1992, Bill Clinton, and he has this</p>
<p>whole new faction within the Democratic Party, the DLC. And</p>
<p>his explicit mandate was to lead them back to the center. And</p>
<p>then he chooses Al Gore, as his running mate to double down on</p>
<p>that image. I don&rsquo;t think Al Gore actually was that centrist,</p>
<p>I think is that but his image at that time was that he was</p>
<p>pretty centrist. So you had, yes, I mean, I think at that</p>
<p>time, so their Democratic Party had to lose for about 12 years</p>
<p>before they nominated a candidate and put him at the</p>
<p>leadership of the party, you could drag them back to the</p>
<p>center. Now, listen, I mean, all we have right now are</p>
<p>foreshadowings of this, we have the Yunkin victory. Last year,</p>
<p>we have the fact those three school board members, San</p>
<p>Francisco, got kicked out. You know, we&rsquo;ll see what happens to</p>
<p>Jason Boudin on June 7. So we&rsquo;re getting these glimmers.</p>
<p>And I think November will be a big test. But where I think this</p>
<p>thing is headed is that the working class voters of this</p>
<p>country don&rsquo;t like this radical progressive shift in the</p>
<p>Democratic Party, and the Democratic Party is going to</p>
<p>keep losing until they&rsquo;re willing to make changes.</p>
<p>Well, immigration is just such an easy one. And according the</p>
<p>working person is what the Democrats did forever. So I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know how they how they can screw this up.</p>
<p>But remember, working class voters don&rsquo;t working class</p>
<p>voters are not in favor of immigration, J. Cal, they do not</p>
<p>want unlimited number of immigrants coming on unlimited,</p>
<p>but they would like to see their family members driving</p>
<p>their wages down. But they do want their family members to be</p>
<p>allowed in. So for the folks who know you talk to you talk to</p>
<p>Hispanic voters who are citizens in America, they are not in</p>
<p>favor of unlimited immigration, because it creates weight</p>
<p>pressure for them. Reasonable. I&rsquo;m telling you that it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not like what you think. The more the higher you are</p>
<p>economically in the social strata, the more professional</p>
<p>you are, the more you like immigration. Because like for</p>
<p>people like us, we like immigrants because they found</p>
<p>companies and we invest in them, we see the economic vitality</p>
<p>that they bring. But if you&rsquo;re a working class, okay, you do not</p>
<p>want that wage pressure. You just don&rsquo;t. So unless the</p>
<p>Democrats figure out a way to talk about it the way we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>talking about it, where we separate high skill and low</p>
<p>skill, they will lose with that message.</p>
<p>All right, let&rsquo;s get into some other things happening in the</p>
<p>market SEC is proposing a new set of rules to regulate SPACs.</p>
<p>I wonder if anybody here can chime in on this. Well, I wrote</p>
<p>who knows about it. I wrote a I wrote an editorial in</p>
<p>Bloomberg, basically a year ago, spelling out a bunch of new</p>
<p>regulations that I thought the SEC should adopt. They adopted</p>
<p>a lot of them in this draft. So I think that that&rsquo;s really good.</p>
<p>They missed a couple of key things. And this is again,</p>
<p>tying back to this other thing when we&rsquo;re in this phase right</p>
<p>now, where we are really questioning how capitalism</p>
<p>should work. I think that there are two reactions that people</p>
<p>can have. One is you pass more regulation that entrenches</p>
<p>existing advantages. And the other is you pass regulation</p>
<p>that either deregulates or democratizes the market. And if</p>
<p>I had to cast the half of my proposals that the SEC adopted,</p>
<p>I would say it falls more into the first bucket than the</p>
<p>second. And Jason, you&rsquo;ve spoken to the second bucket of laws</p>
<p>that the SEC could also change, which is, you know, it&rsquo;s in</p>
<p>their power to give people an on ramp to prove that they are</p>
<p>qualified and accredited so that they can participate in some of</p>
<p>these really, you know, vibrant ways of making money beyond</p>
<p>just investing in the S&amp;P 500, like investing in startups, if</p>
<p>you if you&rsquo;re educated and capable of doing the SEC at the</p>
<p>same time proposed a bunch of legislation around reporting</p>
<p>requirements for ESG. And if you look at both of these two</p>
<p>buckets of laws, I think they&rsquo;re rooted in good ideas. And I</p>
<p>think that there are some good concepts in it. But who really</p>
<p>wins? I think if you look at it, the American Bar Association</p>
<p>had a huge victory here because the amount of incremental</p>
<p>regulation is going up, which means you know, what was a 300</p>
<p>page filing with the SEC will now be 350 pages, right? I think</p>
<p>that benefits lawyers, I think it benefits consultants, I think</p>
<p>it benefits the accountant. So I think it benefits the ecosystem</p>
<p>people that participate, it&rsquo;s not so clear how normal everyday</p>
<p>folks benefit from a lot of this stuff. So I think if you strip</p>
<p>it all away, what I would say is, I think the SEC is trying to</p>
<p>do the right thing. But I would really encourage them to do the</p>
<p>second half of what they should be doing, which is making these</p>
<p>on ramps. Better built,</p>
<p>generally speaking, what do you think happens in the SPAC space,</p>
<p>we had 600 of them, it&rsquo;s gonna, it&rsquo;s gonna consolidate to the</p>
<p>10 of us that know what we&rsquo;re doing. Got it. Just like, you</p>
<p>know, look, the IPO rules are extremely sophisticated. Did it</p>
<p>hurt Morgan Stanley or Goldman Sachs as IPO business? No, it</p>
<p>just meant that the 95 small banks that did IPOs went away.</p>
<p>And it consolidated to six and the league tables, you know,</p>
<p>just churned between the six JP Morgan one year is the top, you</p>
<p>know, then it&rsquo;s Morgan Stanley, then it&rsquo;s Goldman Sachs, then</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s B of A, then it&rsquo;s Credit Suisse. Similarly, SPACs will</p>
<p>consolidate around six or seven players. And you know, we&rsquo;ll do</p>
<p>most of the business. What do you think Friedberg of this new</p>
<p>SEC announcement that they&rsquo;re considering climate disclosures</p>
<p>for public traded companies, this would basically not only</p>
<p>what they&rsquo;re doing in terms of consuming, or, you know, allowing</p>
<p>greenhouse gases and emissions, but also this scope three</p>
<p>concept, your inputs, what is your supply chain doing? And</p>
<p>what are your consumers doing? So if you&rsquo;re making the iPhone,</p>
<p>what happens to the iPhone when the consumer gets rid of it? Or</p>
<p>what did it take to get those minerals out of the ground to</p>
<p>make the iPhone? What do you think? Is this a net benefit? Is</p>
<p>it the lawyers win? Or does measuring all this actually mean</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to see publicly traded companies manage it</p>
<p>better? A lot of opting into it already, like Google and Apple</p>
<p>are doing it on their own accord. But what do you think</p>
<p>generally of this regulation? Well, I&rsquo;ll say let me just say</p>
<p>something on the SPACs. And I&rsquo;ll answer that question. You</p>
<p>know, if you read the comment that the first SEC proposed</p>
<p>rule, it was to amend the definition of a blank check</p>
<p>company to make the liability safe harbor for forward looking</p>
<p>statements, such as business forecasts unavailable and</p>
<p>filings by SPACs. So you know, this was, you know, I think one</p>
<p>of the primary points of appeal over the past couple of years,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve all been private market, sophisticated private market</p>
<p>investors. When we take a pitch or hear a pitch from a company,</p>
<p>we all have the experience and the know how, not always</p>
<p>correctly, but at least we know what to look for what to ask.</p>
<p>And over time have learned through our wounds, and our</p>
<p>failures to appropriately diligence forecast and</p>
<p>understand what they mean and what they say. And, you know,</p>
<p>because the public markets historically through an IPO are</p>
<p>available to retail investors, you know, generally, whatever</p>
<p>the definition is of unqualified, or, you know, folks</p>
<p>who may not have the level of sophistication that, you know,</p>
<p>some regulatory body has deemed is needed to be able to do that</p>
<p>level of diligence. The statements that are made in an</p>
<p>IPO and an S1 need to be kind of factually referenced,</p>
<p>referenceable. And that&rsquo;s not true when it comes to forecasts.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re not included in S1s in an IPO. But</p>
<p>in a SPAC, the appeal was you can tell your forward looking</p>
<p>forecast, paint the rosy picture like you would for a startup.</p>
<p>And then theoretically, the investor should make an</p>
<p>assessment of the risk and the upside and the objectives of</p>
<p>the business is saying they&rsquo;re going to go shoot for and</p>
<p>achieve. And it&rsquo;s pretty evident, and I think we all knew</p>
<p>this, you know, coming out of last year that, you know, many</p>
<p>investors made investments on the basis of those forecasts,</p>
<p>you know, being to some degree, reasonably achievable or likely</p>
<p>achievable. And it turns out that in many cases, they were</p>
<p>not and were not achieved. And that&rsquo;s the big motivation here.</p>
<p>So the real fundamental question, with respect to</p>
<p>Chamath&rsquo;s point about markets, is how much do you want to have</p>
<p>the government and a regulator play the role of deciding who</p>
<p>is and who isn&rsquo;t sophisticated enough to make an assessment</p>
<p>about a business&rsquo;s forward looking prospects? Or should we</p>
<p>simply keep all forward looking prospects, or, you know,</p>
<p>forecasts like, you know, out of those documents, and it&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>important conversation to have. Because for years, people have</p>
<p>been saying, I want to invest in private companies, but I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>a qualified investor. Therefore, I&rsquo;m only going to be able to</p>
<p>invest in public companies. And as we&rsquo;re seeing the problem with</p>
<p>investing in private companies or speculative companies, is</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re investing on the come. And more often than not,</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t end up happening. And that&rsquo;s a really hard lesson</p>
<p>to learn. And SPACs have kind of forced the retail market that</p>
<p>have not historically invested in private companies to learn</p>
<p>that lesson very fast.</p>
<p>This is why, by the way, in my what I what I was asking the SEC</p>
<p>to do on top of the things that they already did was I said,</p>
<p>make us all invest our own money. You know, make the</p>
<p>sponsor really monetarily at risk, I&rsquo;ve invested a minimum of</p>
<p>$100 million in every single deal I&rsquo;ve done as a SPAC</p>
<p>sponsor. That&rsquo;s a lot of money,</p>
<p>more skin in the game and disclosing that would be great.</p>
<p>And maybe even having a clearinghouse where you could see</p>
<p>the percentage of cash to the ultimate raise that the promoter</p>
<p>has</p>
<p>that stuff were great. All of that stuff, Jason is in the</p>
<p>spirit of disclosure and transparency. I just</p>
<p>trust you still think it&rsquo;s important to have forward</p>
<p>looking statements and needs. In fact, I mean, if that ends up</p>
<p>becoming, you know, the cornerstone of this proposed</p>
<p>regulation, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>cornerstone. I think what I think the thing is that there</p>
<p>are really important businesses that need good stewards to help</p>
<p>them get into the public markets to raise money to fund their</p>
<p>business. And there are some people who really understand</p>
<p>that. And there are many others who don&rsquo;t. And the thing that</p>
<p>that the SEC should make a decision on is whether just</p>
<p>having a bunch of middlemen serves a market better or having</p>
<p>a combination of some middlemen and some principles, all</p>
<p>competing is better. Because remember what like what is</p>
<p>capitalism really, you have these trapped sources of money,</p>
<p>right? When you buy an equity, right, or you buy a bond, you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>putting money into a trapped asset, it&rsquo;s an unproductive</p>
<p>asset, it may yield some return, but it&rsquo;s not really generating</p>
<p>it is dead money. Capitalism is about creating an incentive for</p>
<p>you to take that money out of that dead asset, that</p>
<p>unproductive asset and put it directly into the hands of</p>
<p>somebody who will make it productive, I&rsquo;m going to, you</p>
<p>know, build some oil fields, I&rsquo;m going to make a battery</p>
<p>factory, battery factory, I&rsquo;m going to make shoes, whatever it</p>
<p>is, right. And so, you know, having more competition, that</p>
<p>creates the incentives for that process to happen to go from</p>
<p>point A to point B, should be the goal of the government.</p>
<p>Because in the absence of that, again, going back to the</p>
<p>previous conversation, you&rsquo;re going to basically shrink the</p>
<p>incentives of productivity. And I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>anybody wants to have happen.</p>
<p>Such an easy solution to all of this, we have a test if you want</p>
<p>to drive a car. And if you want to drive a big car called the</p>
<p>truck, you have to get a different test. You want to</p>
<p>drive a motorcycle, so I didn&rsquo;t take that.</p>
<p>By the way, Jason, I just want to have a test.</p>
<p>You brought up a really good point earlier. And I just</p>
<p>wanted to put a fine point on what you said.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just say all these companies, let&rsquo;s all of our</p>
<p>startups included will now when we go public have to create</p>
<p>these disclosures around scope one scope to scope three</p>
<p>emissions. And there&rsquo;s this weird concept called</p>
<p>materiality that exists in law, which will now again, have to</p>
<p>get adjudicated. Let&rsquo;s say Apple doesn&rsquo;t disclose what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>actually happening in their factories. Somebody can now sue</p>
<p>them because they will say that&rsquo;s a material disclosure</p>
<p>that you didn&rsquo;t disclose. Well, guess what will happen that</p>
<p>will wind its way in meander its way through the courts.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll take years, there&rsquo;ll be 10s and 10s of millions of</p>
<p>dollars spent on that litigation because Apple will vehemently</p>
<p>defend the right that it wasn&rsquo;t a material disclosure, because</p>
<p>the implications otherwise, will be measured in the billions</p>
<p>or 10s of billions of dollars. So who really wins consultants</p>
<p>when trial experts when the lawyers when lobbyists lobby,</p>
<p>I just I just I just want to frame this up for a second.</p>
<p>Because I think it&rsquo;s important for people to think about,</p>
<p>you know, costs that are external to the business</p>
<p>operation, meaning costs that are born by the broader society</p>
<p>by other members of society, not the business itself. So let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>say that you&rsquo;re a company that makes products with a lot of</p>
<p>sugar, and you know, or cigarettes that you know, we</p>
<p>know, when people consume a lot of sugar, cancer goes up,</p>
<p>obesity goes up, diabetes goes up, the cost for cancer</p>
<p>treatment, the cost for diabetes treatment, the cost for medical</p>
<p>treatment associated with smoking or sugar or alcohol is</p>
<p>born by a health system, where the ultimate cost is shared by a</p>
<p>large group of society by an all number of members, whether</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a public health insurance program or a private one, there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a group that shares that cost. And so you as a consumer are not</p>
<p>paying that cost today. The question is, should you be</p>
<p>paying that cost? And this is true for co2 emissions for</p>
<p>carbon emissions, you know, you drive a gas guzzling car, you</p>
<p>purchase gasoline, there is carbon that goes in the</p>
<p>atmosphere, you&rsquo;re not going to end up individually fixing the</p>
<p>carbon out of the atmosphere later, the rest of us are going</p>
<p>to have to bear that cost as our homes burn down, you know, as</p>
<p>floods cause, you know, houses to wash away, as all the</p>
<p>catastrophe that we&rsquo;re all predicting is going to happen</p>
<p>starts to happen. So the question is, how do you account</p>
<p>for those external costs? And then the second question that</p>
<p>will arise in a market based system that we have is who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to pay for those costs. Right now, we all assume those</p>
<p>costs, and we don&rsquo;t charge anyone for them. We don&rsquo;t just</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t charge anyone for the obesity epidemic. We don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>charge anyone for the cancer epidemic associated with</p>
<p>cigarettes until we had that big legislation that you know,</p>
<p>the DOJ knocked that off. We don&rsquo;t charge anyone today for</p>
<p>carbon emissions that we&rsquo;re all going to have to pay the cost</p>
<p>for. And so you know, the first step is identifying and</p>
<p>quantifying the external costs of the product or service that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re providing, and deciding whether or not to tax the</p>
<p>consumer of that product, whether or not to tax the seller</p>
<p>of that product, and ultimately how to transition that capital</p>
<p>back to the repair mechanism for pulling the effects of that</p>
<p>product back out of the system in this analogy, Coca Cola, if</p>
<p>people drank too much of it and got fat would be responsible for</p>
<p>their diabetes treatment. Well, this goes back to the sugar tax</p>
<p>point, which is should we have a sugar tax because there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>quantifiable effect that too much sugar has on human health,</p>
<p>obesity, diabetes? Yes, sir. I mean, so that&rsquo;s an argument,</p>
<p>right. And so in order to do that, the first step is</p>
<p>disclose the risks disclose the associated conditions that arise</p>
<p>from the product or service that you&rsquo;re offering. And I think</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s part of the intention. And a lot of very smart,</p>
<p>progressive people in capital markets, some good friends of</p>
<p>mine, we spend in talk have been talking for years about the</p>
<p>importance of this level of disclosure, because it is the</p>
<p>first step in truly accounting for climate you&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about? Yeah, for climate. Yeah, pretty controversial. So you</p>
<p>think we should charge? We should charge Coca Cola for</p>
<p>diabetes? Well, go ask the question of should you charge</p>
<p>for a carbon related product for Okay, I&rsquo;ll let&rsquo;s both carbon.</p>
<p>Should corporations be responsible for the downstream</p>
<p>carbon from their customers and the upstream at least</p>
<p>disclose it and decide who&rsquo;s ultimately gonna have to pay for</p>
<p>that? Or is the answer to the former is yes. The answer to the</p>
<p>latter is if you you know, there&rsquo;s a there&rsquo;s a term shit</p>
<p>in shit out. Yeah. And garbage in garbage out. I&rsquo;ve spent a lot</p>
<p>of time in climate. I know what&rsquo;s measurable and what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not. I&rsquo;ve looked at the space a lot. And I just think that there</p>
<p>is no credible way to execute on David what you&rsquo;re saying you</p>
<p>want. All it&rsquo;s going to do is going to create a bunch of money</p>
<p>that flows to consultants that create BS nonsensical reports.</p>
<p>And in your mind, the downstream and the downstream</p>
<p>implication of that will be lawsuit upon lawsuit that gets</p>
<p>adjudicated by the courts on this concept of materiality.</p>
<p>You think we should be recording a free burger? Now you disagree</p>
<p>or agree with tomorrow? No, I agree. It should be recorded.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m saying okay, it&rsquo;s not possible. I&rsquo;m saying the only</p>
<p>winners in this will be the consultants. You agree with</p>
<p>that? Look, I&rsquo;ll agree these carbon markets are absolute BS</p>
<p>carbon sequestration mechanisms are absolute BS. I mean, none of</p>
<p>this stuff is real right now. It&rsquo;s all fraudulent markets.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all grifters. It&rsquo;s all BS trash. Yeah, I&rsquo;m not trying to</p>
<p>be too disparaging with everyone. There are good</p>
<p>actors out there and good intentions for sure. There is a</p>
<p>tree, but there&rsquo;s a lot of ways that you can kind of take this</p>
<p>stuff apart and say, you know what, this doesn&rsquo;t actually add</p>
<p>up. And there&rsquo;s a good business to be out in the meantime. And</p>
<p>everyone feels good running that business. Simple example,</p>
<p>Jason, how will you know that a sensor that&rsquo;s on a flu of a</p>
<p>manufacturing plant is accurate? How do you know that it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>been doctored? How do you know? Just to say just a very, very</p>
<p>simple question. Just that. Well, when it came to Volkswagen,</p>
<p>a leaker leaked the information and that&rsquo;s and the press got on</p>
<p>it. And that&rsquo;s how it was regulated. It was it was in the</p>
<p>review mirror. That&rsquo;s how Volkswagen got busted. So that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>how we&rsquo;re gonna we&rsquo;re gonna fix. No, that&rsquo;s a bunch of</p>
<p>whistleblowers. I mean, that&rsquo;s what happened also within RJ</p>
<p>Nabisco and the cigarettes as well. And what changed as a</p>
<p>result of that? Nothing. No, in the cigarette industry, that</p>
<p>led to the largest fines in the history of corporate America, I</p>
<p>think, up until that time, we still don&rsquo;t have a tax, we still</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have a pool, they don&rsquo;t have a tax. We have a big tax on</p>
<p>tax on cigarettes. Yeah. It&rsquo;s a lower consumption. Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p>But we don&rsquo;t, you know, we don&rsquo;t force these companies to</p>
<p>basically subsidize a portion of our healthcare costs. Every</p>
<p>time somebody shows up with lung cancer, it&rsquo;s not like we say,</p>
<p>you know what, that&rsquo;s going to be half borne by RJR Nabisco.</p>
<p>Yeah. So I mean, this, the measurement can&rsquo;t be bad. But I</p>
<p>guess it&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re saying. No, I&rsquo;m saying the concept is</p>
<p>good. The measurement is literally so terrible as to be</p>
<p>worthless. And so wouldn&rsquo;t there be a bunch of new companies</p>
<p>that come up, though, that then create the auditing trail. So</p>
<p>you say, hey, we&rsquo;re going to put that you have to have one of</p>
<p>these companies, put the sensors on your factory, and it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>small oddity of, you know, again, there&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>companies, for example, this is where Silicon Valley, I think</p>
<p>gets a little, you know, caught up in their own nonsense.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of companies in Silicon Valley that have made a</p>
<p>lot of money measuring bits, right? analytics companies,</p>
<p>because the exhaust of a tech company is sitting in some log</p>
<p>file somewhere. That&rsquo;s just a matter of being parsed, right?</p>
<p>Do some ETL, do some transformations, put it in some</p>
<p>beautiful table, run some query on top of it. Lo and behold, you</p>
<p>can know everything about your company. When you&rsquo;re measuring</p>
<p>atoms, it&rsquo;s just a little bit more complicated. And I think</p>
<p>that people underestimate that complexity. So while the desire</p>
<p>of this is good, I think the whole point is that, you know,</p>
<p>if you draft this language the wrong way, again, my own, I want</p>
<p>to be very precise what I&rsquo;m saying, what I think it will do,</p>
<p>instead of actually causing more conformity and have people</p>
<p>emitting less carbon, it&rsquo;ll create a shadow industry of</p>
<p>measurement and consulting around this industry, while</p>
<p>people debate materiality when they get caught. Got it. That is</p>
<p>not the point of this. But when you draft laws like this, you</p>
<p>have to think about these implications.</p>
<p>So is there is there an easy answer here or just no easy</p>
<p>answers? In terms of if we want companies to be somewhat more</p>
<p>knowledgeable and responsible in their carbon emissions?</p>
<p>Well, I think that the responsibility ultimately comes</p>
<p>from the end consumer buyer customer of a product. Because</p>
<p>if they have an alternative, that offers them those trade</p>
<p>offs, whether it&rsquo;s at a higher price or a lower price or the</p>
<p>same price, and they adopt it, then these companies really pay</p>
<p>attention, right? Because ultimately, what they really</p>
<p>care about is their downstream profitability. Otherwise, I</p>
<p>worry that a lot of what&rsquo;s happening in corporate America</p>
<p>today is basically some form of greenwashing. You know, so for</p>
<p>example, like we joke, but it&rsquo;s true. When you look at these</p>
<p>carbon offset markets, these indirect offset markets, what</p>
<p>are they? A company spews all kinds of gnarly stuff into the</p>
<p>environment. They hire a consulting firm, I just want to</p>
<p>explain to you how it works today, they hire a consulting</p>
<p>firm who uses an Excel spreadsheet to guesstimate how</p>
<p>badly they have polluted the environment. Okay, it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>fundamental guess. Then they go to another company that says,</p>
<p>Well, can you buy me some equal and offsetting amount of</p>
<p>credits. And that company then will go and plant some trees or</p>
<p>buy some trees, claim the trees exist, measure and impute again</p>
<p>in a different Excel spreadsheet, how much you know,</p>
<p>carbon capture is happening by those trees. Do we know that</p>
<p>those trees aren&rsquo;t getting sold 10 times over to 10 other</p>
<p>companies? We don&rsquo;t know that. So my point is that we have a</p>
<p>lot of work to do to solve these problems, I would rather see</p>
<p>again, raw capitalism solve this problem. And I think in in</p>
<p>climate change, the most productive thing we could do is</p>
<p>lower the barriers for trapped unproductive capital to get into</p>
<p>the hands of really amazing scientists and entrepreneurs who</p>
<p>are building things that can measurably remove carbon from</p>
<p>the environment. And there&rsquo;s really two easy ways to do it.</p>
<p>One is have a test. And the other is on the roads, we have a</p>
<p>speed limit. So if you are a non affluent person already, but</p>
<p>you want to dabble in this, it&rsquo;s a very simple way to do it.</p>
<p>Schmott, I propose, have a written test, just like you have</p>
<p>a handgun or a car test, a driving test. And then how</p>
<p>about you can deploy 10%? It&rsquo;s so incredible. You just said</p>
<p>this, you can allow an 18 year old person to buy an AR Give me</p>
<p>the name of the gun AR 15 and a car and go speed down the</p>
<p>highway, but they&rsquo;re not allowed to invest in go puff. Yeah, no,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re too not sophisticated. You shoot the bullets in the</p>
<p>air while you&rsquo;re going down the road is going on. It&rsquo;s Well, I</p>
<p>mean, there&rsquo;s no path to it. That&rsquo;s the frustrating part.</p>
<p>Like in some places, it&rsquo;s hard to get a gun, you got to take a</p>
<p>eight hour test other places, you can just buy them on the</p>
<p>wherever you allow 18 year olds, you can allow an 18 year old to</p>
<p>take psychedelics and marijuana legally, yes, open in a market,</p>
<p>by a gun, but they are not secondary shares of Stripe. No,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re just Yes. And so this is the stupidity of it. Well,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s and here&rsquo;s the other thing, you can have two</p>
<p>different things, you have the test. So now you know, the</p>
<p>person is educated. But you could also say, Hey, listen,</p>
<p>whatever&rsquo;s on your tax return for the last two years, you can</p>
<p>invest 10% of that a year in, you know, private companies. So</p>
<p>if you made, I don&rsquo;t know, 150,000, the last two years,</p>
<p>you made 75,000 a year, okay, you can put 15,000.</p>
<p>You will allow people to go and work for startups, to help</p>
<p>build the enterprise value of a startup, let&rsquo;s pick our favorite</p>
<p>startup, like an Uber, but not invest in their equity before</p>
<p>they go public, right? You&rsquo;re not sophisticated, you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>sophisticated enough to build it, you&rsquo;ll you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>sophisticated enough to drive for them for years to help them</p>
<p>build a $50 billion company, but not buy a piece of that company</p>
<p>along the way. Yeah, that doesn&rsquo;t seem right, either. But</p>
<p>you could pull over and buy scratch off tickets and lottery</p>
<p>tickets to the cows come home. But you can&rsquo;t buy a scratch off</p>
<p>ticket in a store. It makes no sense.</p>
<p>All right, Sachs, you&rsquo;ve been quiet in all of this. I know</p>
<p>that you hate the environment and regulation. What&rsquo;s your</p>
<p>thoughts? I&rsquo;m not, I&rsquo;m just not deep in this topic. So I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>want to weigh in. All right, well, here&rsquo;s one you are deep</p>
<p>in Facebook hired a GOP lobbying firm to smear TikTok</p>
<p>according to the Washington Post.</p>
<p>What did you say to Sachs?</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s something you&rsquo;re deep in, it&rsquo;s the GOP.</p>
<p>No, no, before that, you said he&rsquo;s like into destroying the</p>
<p>environment or something. Yeah, no, he doesn&rsquo;t care about the</p>
<p>environment. I mean, Sachs is never going to go into the</p>
<p>forest and even go near a tree. He doesn&rsquo;t go outside.</p>
<p>No, look at him. He&rsquo;s got a sealed bedroom.</p>
<p>Absolutely, he closed the curtains. He&rsquo;s like, oh,</p>
<p>beautiful view of the sky. Oh, nature like the Pope, his car</p>
<p>has one of these things. He doesn&rsquo;t even have to sit down.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just enclosed. He stands up. It&rsquo;s bulletproof glass.</p>
<p>You know, he just waves as he goes by.</p>
<p>I go outside sometimes I&rsquo;d much prefer going to an outdoor</p>
<p>shooting range than an indoor shooting range.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re going shooting. It&rsquo;s an outdoor one.</p>
<p>So this is a really crazy story. Taylor runs broke it.</p>
<p>Facebook paid the GOP lobbying for your friend.</p>
<p>Actually, I had her on the show. Here is the excerpted from the</p>
<p>internal targeted victory email obtained by the Washington Post</p>
<p>quote, get the message out that while meta Facebook is</p>
<p>currently a punching bag, tick tock is the real threat,</p>
<p>especially as a foreign owned app that is number one in</p>
<p>sharing data that young teens are using bonus point if we can</p>
<p>fit this into a broader message that current bills proposals</p>
<p>aren&rsquo;t where state attorney generals or member of Congress</p>
<p>should be focused. So what do we think? I mean, we&rsquo;ve talked</p>
<p>here many times about reciprocity. We can&rsquo;t have our</p>
<p>social networks in China. Why should tick tock be here? I</p>
<p>think we all agree. It sounds like they want to do a PR</p>
<p>initiative around the points that you&rsquo;ve always made on this</p>
<p>pod. Exactly. No, I mean, that&rsquo;s the that&rsquo;s the they could be</p>
<p>right about this, but doing a dirty hack. Yeah. It&rsquo;s a dirty</p>
<p>trick in a way for them to deflect attention from the</p>
<p>sales onto some other companies problems. So there&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>distasteful about that. But the point that they&rsquo;re making is</p>
<p>kind of true. I mean, we should not allow I mean, I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>saying we shouldn&rsquo;t allow them. But I think whatever you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>you think tick tock should be allowed in the United States?</p>
<p>Really? I don&rsquo;t know about that. But I just think that one of</p>
<p>what do you think about whatever people have with</p>
<p>Facebook, they should have them like 10x with tick tock. That&rsquo;s</p>
<p>kind of my point. 1000% in agreement on this tick tock is</p>
<p>run by a country that we wondered, do they care about the</p>
<p>data and then they literally passed a law. If you want to run</p>
<p>your company, the government has to have the data. I have</p>
<p>fallen into a tick tock rabbit hole. And I would like to come</p>
<p>clean. Oh, with you guys. There&rsquo;s something there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>something on tick tock called sandwich bros. What are these</p>
<p>guys? These guys are guys that make sandwiches. And then they</p>
<p>cut the sandwich and then they open it up so that you can see</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s in the inside of it. Gooey cheese. He I mean, just</p>
<p>know some of these fucking sandwiches. These guys are</p>
<p>Sammy. Dude, I have watched an hour straight of sandwich talk.</p>
<p>Wait, here&rsquo;s the best part. So then there is this woman who I</p>
<p>thought was going to be incredible. She&rsquo;s like, you know,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m tired of these sandwich bros. I&rsquo;m going to be the first</p>
<p>woman that really breaks through making sandwiches. I was like,</p>
<p>you go get it. And she made a vegan sandwich. God damn it. And</p>
<p>I was like, where&rsquo;s the meat? I wanted to be I wanted to be deep</p>
<p>into it. But like, you know, chicken, roast chicken. Oh, my</p>
<p>God is bacon, avocado, bacon, bacon, maybe some pickles in</p>
<p>there. Get a little Yeah, I mean, this is the thing that I</p>
<p>find. So chicken masala burrito, that&rsquo;s probably my one. And the</p>
<p>guy made it from scratch, like everything from scratch. I love</p>
<p>that. Here&rsquo;s the problem. It&rsquo;s such a compelling product. You</p>
<p>feel so terrible using it. So you love it at something and</p>
<p>then you feel very vapid for having used and you have regret.</p>
<p>And then the Chinese are running it. And they&rsquo;re programming our</p>
<p>children and have all their data and locations. You know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a lot of conflicted feelings. What do you think</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re trying to program in me with all the sandwich stuff?</p>
<p>Maybe you&rsquo;re too thin and you need to eat a sandwich. Maybe</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re trying to be vegan. But that sandwich? Yuck. It looked</p>
<p>horrible. I think this is UGS. They&rsquo;re trying to program. No</p>
<p>offense to get fat. But yuck. That&rsquo;s what they want. They want</p>
<p>you to get fat. What are you seeing on your Tick Tock feed</p>
<p>right now? Friedberg since you&rsquo;re so obsessed with your</p>
<p>phone? And should should Tick Tock be banned? Should the</p>
<p>Chinese be allowed to program our children with our algorithm?</p>
<p>Yes or no, Friedberg?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re looking at? Well, just mentioning the</p>
<p>product makes you want to use it. So it&rsquo;s so addicting. What</p>
<p>is so addicting about it?</p>
<p>Friedberg, tell me the best vegan sandwich you ever had,</p>
<p>like the best one, like, is there one that sawdust?</p>
<p>quinoa, quinoa, cucumber, there&rsquo;s a there&rsquo;s a great</p>
<p>sandwich shop in Berkeley, you guys. None of you I don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>ever go to Berkeley. I live in Palo Alto. It&rsquo;s too far. Yeah,</p>
<p>Berkeley is I&rsquo;ll get one. I&rsquo;ll actually get one ubered over</p>
<p>to you. Well, what is it? What&rsquo;s not in it? Avocado sprouts?</p>
<p>Yeah, sprouts. I don&rsquo;t know. Actually, there&rsquo;s one I like</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s got the the feta cheese, like the really good, sharp,</p>
<p>salty feta cheese. Yeah. Okay. So it&rsquo;s actually voted one of</p>
<p>the best sandwich shops in California. I think. Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Really good. No, I made myself a tempeh avocado sandwich for</p>
<p>lunch today. Oh, yeah. That&rsquo;s Yeah, that&rsquo;s fantastic. You</p>
<p>know what, I was gonna do that myself. But instead, I just</p>
<p>decided to slam my hand with a hammer.</p>
<p>Just like smash my hand bag. Oh, I had crab ravioli. Oh,</p>
<p>wonderful. Wonderful. This is absolutely great. You murdered</p>
<p>those crabs. Delicious. Okay, but let&rsquo;s just go around the</p>
<p>horn. Should yes or no, tick tock be banned? Should a Chinese</p>
<p>company be allowed to have a social network at scale in the</p>
<p>United States? Yes or no? Friedberg? No, yes, I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think that we should be restricting the products and</p>
<p>services that people choose to use. Even from a communist</p>
<p>country that is likely spying on them. Okay, got it. We know</p>
<p>where you stand sacks. Well, I&rsquo;d want I&rsquo;d want to know that</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not that it&rsquo;s not spyware. Right? So yeah, but</p>
<p>spyware sure that&rsquo;s illegal. If it&rsquo;s illegal, stop it. But</p>
<p>like, so you&rsquo;re saying you trust you trust the Chinese</p>
<p>government? No, I don&rsquo;t trust them. It would be a serious it</p>
<p>would be an issue I&rsquo;d seriously look at I might come out</p>
<p>on the India side of things. But I&rsquo;d like to understand a</p>
<p>little better like what the India side of things being that</p>
<p>India has a band. Yeah, they just they&rsquo;re smart. Indians are</p>
<p>smart. I would think about that. I just think it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>slippery slope. And then you end up seeing China ban iPhones.</p>
<p>And I mean, you know, the whole thing kind of already banned.</p>
<p>They already banned Twitter, Facebook and Instagram in their</p>
<p>country. There&rsquo;s still a lot. There&rsquo;s a big consumer market</p>
<p>in China for us goods and services. And it just seems like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s pretty slow. Where do you think I think you guys nailed</p>
<p>it, which is that I think these things have to be quid pro quo,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t make any sense, in my opinion, for us to allow a</p>
<p>non American company to thrive, where in that same end market,</p>
<p>our products are not allowed to compete. Absolutely. So I think</p>
<p>there are two things that matter to me, which is that, you know,</p>
<p>if we&rsquo;re going to allow tick tock to thrive here, it seems</p>
<p>like there needs to be some version of a deal that says,</p>
<p>Facebook, Google, you know, these core products and</p>
<p>services just need to have a chance where consumers can vote.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one thing. And I do think separately, what David said is</p>
<p>really importantly true. And I don&rsquo;t think it applies to just</p>
<p>tick tock. But whenever a product gets to a certain level</p>
<p>of scale, and we can define what that threshold is, but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>probably in the half a billion to a billion mile kind of range,</p>
<p>monthly active users range. You do have to a way of like, you</p>
<p>know, going through the source and making sure there&rsquo;s no crazy</p>
<p>spyware in there. And I don&rsquo;t know exactly how to do that. But</p>
<p>I think that that that should just be a general expectation</p>
<p>for any product. Because look, let&rsquo;s let&rsquo;s be honest. And we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>had this conversation before, you don&rsquo;t think the odds are</p>
<p>high that at some point, some very talented knowledge worker</p>
<p>that is on an immigrant visa inside of one of these large</p>
<p>tech companies isn&rsquo;t actually working on behalf of a foreign</p>
<p>Oh, they had Twitter had it they had two people from the</p>
<p>kingdom right there. So So my point is, I think that that</p>
<p>these things are probably true, right? Like in the 10s of</p>
<p>1000s employees that work in big tech, there&rsquo;s probably at</p>
<p>least five or 10 of these people that work on behalf of foreign</p>
<p>government. So we don&rsquo;t know what they may or may not have</p>
<p>introduced in certain elements of the code. So it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>unreasonable to fund a, you know, an organization that can</p>
<p>audit this code base. But I think that I would rather let</p>
<p>them stay in order to open up that end market for our</p>
<p>products. All right, we have to wrap on this. Freebird a</p>
<p>couple weeks ago, you outline the pasta, the potential of</p>
<p>famines caused by Putin&rsquo;s insane, you know, war in</p>
<p>Ukraine. That&rsquo;s not what I said. But sure. Okay, I&rsquo;m framing</p>
<p>it and framing the way I want, but you commented on the</p>
<p>possible famine caused by Putin&rsquo;s insane war. Again, not</p>
<p>what I said. But let&rsquo;s go to famine before sacks loses his</p>
<p>mind about Biden&rsquo;s quote of regime change, which I&rsquo;ll let</p>
<p>you end on section get your victory lap. But somebody came</p>
<p>for you and said, Hey, listen, freeberg basically doesn&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>what he&rsquo;s talking about. Because commodity markets are</p>
<p>showing that India and other folks are going to step up and</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s not going to be a problem of famine. So can you</p>
<p>unpack that for us?</p>
<p>I will tell you that we are already seeing a lot of</p>
<p>scrambling happening for redundancy in these commodity</p>
<p>supply chains. And there&rsquo;s a couple of issues, which I</p>
<p>highlighted before I&rsquo;ll highlight again, number one is</p>
<p>just the ability to export. So while there may be product</p>
<p>commodity products sitting in these markets, getting them on</p>
<p>ships out of Russia out of Ukraine, even if sanctions and</p>
<p>trade restrictions are lifted and make them available, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>very difficult because a lot of the carriers are concerned</p>
<p>about insurance and liability, as they would be forced to go</p>
<p>into a port and do a transaction with an entity that they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>supposed to not do transactions with. So there&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>reasons why these ships are not going to port, not picking a</p>
<p>product and not bringing it to where it needs to go. Critical</p>
<p>risk in Africa in the near term. So this is an acute</p>
<p>problem with respect to transport. The next problem is</p>
<p>with respect to planting. As of this week, and I&rsquo;m going to put</p>
<p>a couple of links in here. And these links, Nick are not in</p>
<p>order with respect to what I&rsquo;ll say. But I&rsquo;ll, you know, I&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>kind of put a bunch of these things out here. But there is an</p>
<p>expectation that we could see up to an 80% decline in planted</p>
<p>acres in the Ukraine. And there&rsquo;s a bunch of really good</p>
<p>anecdotes in this particular story about how farmers are</p>
<p>scared about going out and planting because groans might</p>
<p>blow them up. And I mean, look, you&rsquo;re in the middle of a war</p>
<p>zone, you&rsquo;re not in a rush to go out and plant. And so there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>lot of planting that needs to happen in order for us to have,</p>
<p>you know, the expectation of the supply coming out of the field</p>
<p>in about six months. So that&rsquo;s kind of the second stage of the</p>
<p>problem is a large export market for goods coming out of Ukraine</p>
<p>and Russia might be don&rsquo;t you know, might we might have a kind</p>
<p>of significant reduction in inventory as the number of acres</p>
<p>that are planted goes down. And then the third thing that I</p>
<p>highlighted before, which is absolutely still very true, and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve put some data in here that you can all look at is related</p>
<p>to the price of fertilizer. So fertilizer prices through the</p>
<p>roof, because nat gas has gone up. So ammonia prices have gone</p>
<p>up. potash exports are prohibited from Russia. So</p>
<p>potash has gone up. And so as a result, we&rsquo;re seeing fertilizer</p>
<p>prices shoot up. And in a lot of countries, what I&rsquo;ve included</p>
<p>here, in this particular link in the chat, and Nick on the</p>
<p>YouTube, you can kind of put this on the screen. But there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a guy named Gary snicky. Gary is the ag economist. He&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>the number one ag economist in the world. He&rsquo;s at University</p>
<p>Illinois, everyone reads all his stuff in the industry. This</p>
<p>guy breaks everything down to unit economics numbers helps</p>
<p>people make decisions about what to plant when what the</p>
<p>economics are. And he highlights the current economics for</p>
<p>planting in Illinois. Illinois is the you know, largest corn</p>
<p>producing state in the US and a critical supplier of our, you</p>
<p>know, national kind of food supply. And he points out that,</p>
<p>you know, as of right now, you would have to invest in</p>
<p>Illinois, about $810 to have a $243 return on corn, because</p>
<p>the price of fertilizer has gone so high. So you invest</p>
<p>810, you expect to make a little over 1000. And these,</p>
<p>you know, these, these are not assuming rent. The problem is</p>
<p>when you factor in the cost of rent, the average rent in</p>
<p>Illinois $227. So a lot of farmers in Illinois rent their</p>
<p>land about half do. And so for a lot of farmers, it&rsquo;s actually</p>
<p>uneconomical, not just in Illinois, but around the world</p>
<p>now, where the cost of the inputs, the cost of rent, the</p>
<p>cost of production exceeds the expected profit coming out of</p>
<p>the farm. And so farmers are not going to plant. And so you</p>
<p>know, we&rsquo;re seeing kind of a major issue with with these</p>
<p>farmers around the world kind of making planting decisions right</p>
<p>now that are informed by upside down economics. This is being</p>
<p>monitored, you know, fortunately, in the US, the USDA</p>
<p>reported today that it looks like the price of corn is such</p>
<p>that a lot of farmers are going to go back and plant soybeans.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re seeing basically a historic planting survey coming</p>
<p>out today that says farmers are in fact going to go out in the</p>
<p>field, they are in fact going to plant. But this is not true</p>
<p>everywhere. We don&rsquo;t we haven&rsquo;t done the calculus on it yet. But</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a ton of anecdotal support and a ton of survey data</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s coming out, showing that farmers aren&rsquo;t going to plant</p>
<p>the acres that they normally would plant because costs are so</p>
<p>high. That means there&rsquo;s going to be less production over the</p>
<p>next year. That means famine hits us in a year. That&rsquo;s a big</p>
<p>problem. Saks wants to know why they don&rsquo;t just use DoorDash or</p>
<p>Uber Eats is to just order more food if they can&rsquo;t. This is not</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going through David&rsquo;s mind right now. David&rsquo;s mind is</p>
<p>David is honing in. He&rsquo;s like LeBron in the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s, you know, left. He&rsquo;s like, everybody get out of the</p>
<p>way. Give me just ISO ball. He&rsquo;s gonna do it. He&rsquo;s about to</p>
<p>play out there. All right, here we go. One David go. All right,</p>
<p>here we go. So right as we got off air, and I was defending,</p>
<p>hey, listen, you&rsquo;re, you&rsquo;re mind reading Biden. He&rsquo;s never</p>
<p>said regime change. You got to give him some credit here.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re, you&rsquo;re taking madman Putin&rsquo;s, you know, version of</p>
<p>events over our own presidents. And then 12 hours later, I&rsquo;m on</p>
<p>the ski lift and crazy grandpa decides to say for God&rsquo;s sake,</p>
<p>this man, referring to Putin, cannot remain in power. Of</p>
<p>course, the White House walk this back, but go ahead and take</p>
<p>your victory lap sacks. Oh, my God, am I getting an apology</p>
<p>here from Jake out to an apology? You know, I was right,</p>
<p>but you said I was, it was basically pro Putin because of</p>
<p>what I said. And now you&rsquo;re admitting that I was telling the</p>
<p>truth. No, I admit that. Biden crazy grandpa said something he</p>
<p>shouldn&rsquo;t have said. And that maybe that reflects truly how he</p>
<p>feels. And right, that&rsquo;s called so in Washington, they call that</p>
<p>a Kinsley gaffer, the New Republic editor, Michael</p>
<p>Kinsley, who said, a gaff in Washington is when a politician</p>
<p>accidentally tells the truth. That&rsquo;s what Biden did. He</p>
<p>actually told the truth about what the administration policy</p>
<p>has been. Yes. And you know, you can see this in the fact that</p>
<p>look, who&rsquo;s playing peacemaker right now in these peace</p>
<p>conversations. It&rsquo;s been Macron from France. It&rsquo;s been enough</p>
<p>Tali Bennett from Israel. It&rsquo;s been Erdogan from Turkey. It has</p>
<p>not been anyone from the United States. We&rsquo;ve been strangely</p>
<p>absent. And to the extent we said anything about the peace</p>
<p>process, it always seems to be us throwing cold water on it. So</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s been a lot of people, you know, prominent</p>
<p>commentators, like Neil Ferguson, who I quoted before,</p>
<p>and others who have speculated that the United States&rsquo;s goal</p>
<p>here is not a rapid resolution to the conflict, but rather to</p>
<p>protract it in order to make Russia bleed in order to</p>
<p>destabilize and topple the Russian regime. I think it was</p>
<p>actually quite and the problem with that is it&rsquo;s very</p>
<p>dangerous. I mean, just look at what Freiburg just said about</p>
<p>the food insecurity that&rsquo;s causing it is very dangerous for</p>
<p>us to protract this conflict, so that you know, famine could</p>
<p>be worse, the war could spread, it could degenerate, we could</p>
<p>get drawn into it somehow, we want this thing to be over as</p>
<p>quickly as possible. And I think it was actually the Biden</p>
<p>gaffe net net was a very positive thing, because they had</p>
<p>to walk it back so quickly, and severely, and severely, that it</p>
<p>basically it showed the whole world. And you know, the media</p>
<p>administration, no, we really need to end this quickly. We</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t be dragging this thing out. So I think by stating what</p>
<p>their clandestine policy was so clearly, it forced them to have</p>
<p>to disavow it. And the only people who were upset at the end</p>
<p>of the day, were these like neocons, well, you know, no, no,</p>
<p>no, what Biden said is true, we should try and topple Putin.</p>
<p>Yeah, theoretically, he should go but not right, right now.</p>
<p>And that was actually very clarifying for us policy,</p>
<p>because regime change should not be our goal.</p>
<p>I think I think I think the administration said something</p>
<p>effective. He was speaking as a man.</p>
<p>I mean, let&rsquo;s, I mean, look, can we be honest about Biden? I</p>
<p>mean, they they don&rsquo;t know what he&rsquo;s gonna say next. I mean,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s his. I mean, I don&rsquo;t mean to, you know, speak ill of</p>
<p>anybody. But cognitively, this is a huge gap. It&rsquo;s a huge</p>
<p>mistake. We&rsquo;re trying to resolve this thing. And then you give</p>
<p>Putin exactly the ammunition he wants. Oh, look, it&rsquo;s regime</p>
<p>change. See, and I think what we may have here is two crazy</p>
<p>grandpas, one that wants to put the USSR back together. And one</p>
<p>that wants to be the person who asked Putin, neither of those is</p>
<p>what the world wants.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a real bummer that we are kind of on the second stage</p>
<p>here, just idling around looking around while these other</p>
<p>countries are sort of creating a, you know, almost like this</p>
<p>new world order around us. That&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Yeah, we played our hands right. We played our hand very badly,</p>
<p>because we keep intervening in all these countries where</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no upside. I mean, I keep talking about it. All of</p>
<p>these wars where we spent trillions, we got nothing out</p>
<p>of it. You&rsquo;re a peacenik. We like it. I&rsquo;m just, I don&rsquo;t see</p>
<p>the pieces. I&rsquo;m a realist. First of all, I do like peace</p>
<p>better than war. But I don&rsquo;t understand the point of going to</p>
<p>war when there&rsquo;s no vital American interest that&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>jeopardized. Our security is not jeopardized. Our economy is not</p>
<p>jeopardized. In fact, us protracting the war is going to</p>
<p>jeopardize those things. So well, I don&rsquo;t get what American</p>
<p>policy is designed to achieve or has been designed to achieve</p>
<p>for the last 20 years. We&rsquo;ve just been stumbling around the</p>
<p>world, making all these like virtue signaling statements</p>
<p>about values. And then meanwhile, we end up like bombing</p>
<p>the hell out of these countries. Well, the Middle East was for</p>
<p>clearly</p>
<p>Afghanistan.</p>
<p>I mean, you know, those were about oil.</p>
<p>What were we doing? They&rsquo;re trying to build a new state, a</p>
<p>new, new sort of democracy in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>That was legitimate. That was a legitimate reason to go there,</p>
<p>which was to get Osama bin Laden. That was the just cause</p>
<p>whack. But you know what, once and you know what, we should</p>
<p>have gotten a Torah bore instead of outsourcing it to the locals.</p>
<p>That was a total screw up huge. But once that job was done, we</p>
<p>should have been out of there. Absolutely. Absolutely. What a</p>
<p>what a misadventure. What do we have? Do you have any thoughts</p>
<p>acts on like the endgame here? Because it does seem like Putin</p>
<p>is getting exhausted. And maybe he he gets the win.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna be it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s basically Ukraine&rsquo;s gonna be</p>
<p>neutral. They can&rsquo;t be part of NATO. They get some security</p>
<p>guarantees from the Western exchange for that. Crimea is</p>
<p>part of Russia. That&rsquo;s a fait accompli. It happened in 2014.</p>
<p>And then the last part is what they&rsquo;re really fighting over,</p>
<p>which is this Donbass region, where you&rsquo;ve got Russian ethnic</p>
<p>speakers going up against Ukrainian far right nationalists</p>
<p>how close and they can agree with both those sides are willing</p>
<p>to fight. So that&rsquo;s the issue. And look, the truth of the</p>
<p>matter is, I think it&rsquo;s going to result in some form of</p>
<p>independence for these disputed territories of Donetsk and</p>
<p>Luhansk. Right? I mean, and, but the reality is United States</p>
<p>of America doesn&rsquo;t have a vital interest 37 days into this. Is</p>
<p>it going to end in under 60?</p>
<p>Just it&rsquo;s actually just the right approach, I think, a month</p>
<p>ago, which is let all of those people vote.</p>
<p>Just have a plebiscite have a referendum,</p>
<p>create a create a referendum, let them vote, let them be</p>
<p>self deterministic. And that may be the most reasonable middle</p>
<p>ground for both sides to say, Okay, let&rsquo;s give this a shot.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re right, if you could achieve a ceasefire, if</p>
<p>you could get a ceasefire here, and this, yeah, if you could get</p>
<p>a ceasefire, have the UN observers come in administer an</p>
<p>election, Crimea, there&rsquo;s no doubt which way Crimea would go.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what would happen in Luhansk or Donetsk. I think</p>
<p>they probably would go independent. So let&rsquo;s just do a</p>
<p>vote. It&rsquo;ll be about self determination, not appeasement.</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s find out. That&rsquo;s what we should be pushing for.</p>
<p>Yeah, people getting to vote on their future. Well, crazy idea.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s got to end. I mean, it&rsquo;s got to end in month two,</p>
<p>this is becoming super damaging for Putin, right? I mean, these</p>
<p>economic sanctions. Plus, you see, there&rsquo;s a story that was on</p>
<p>MSN. It&rsquo;s like a 37. Russia is 83%. His approval ratings have</p>
<p>gone up. We thought not, you could say it&rsquo;s fake, whatever.</p>
<p>But apparently, this is a reasonably decent polling</p>
<p>operation. This is a poll by Levada Center, an independent</p>
<p>pollster in Moscow. Well, apparently his polling, his poll</p>
<p>numbers for 69% of January, they&rsquo;ve gone up. Look, Russians</p>
<p>will rally around the flag just like what about the resources</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re suffering in that country. And they are suffering.</p>
<p>But the Russians are very good at suffering. J. Cal, this</p>
<p>international pastime. You ever read Dostoyevsky? Yeah, no, no,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like to read it. War and Peace. No, I don&rsquo;t. Actually,</p>
<p>I would much rather watch the next Marvel movie, or a Kurosawa</p>
<p>film. I am not interested in. Yeah, listen, my whole speech</p>
<p>was about the fact that American diplomacy could have</p>
<p>prevented the situation last year. That&rsquo;s not to say that we</p>
<p>caused it. It was Putin&rsquo;s decision to invade. It&rsquo;s his</p>
<p>war. The bloodshed is on him. However, more effective</p>
<p>diplomacy could have defused the situation a year ago. And we</p>
<p>totally blew it. We just totally blew it. And this is going to</p>
<p>hurt us. This I mean, look, this is one of those things that</p>
<p>the administration thinks doesn&rsquo;t affect them. But you</p>
<p>know what, when our economy goes into a recession, because this</p>
<p>is a straw that breaks, breaks its camel&rsquo;s back, it voters are</p>
<p>going to take it into consideration. You know, we do</p>
<p>we do hire people in many, many industries to do their job. And</p>
<p>the people that are hired to be diplomats, their job is to be</p>
<p>diplomatic, and to find compromises. All right,</p>
<p>everybody, it&rsquo;s time to wrap here. Some exciting news on the</p>
<p>conference front Palmer lucky of Andrew technologies, building</p>
<p>weapons and systems and defensive systems is going to</p>
<p>come to the event. He&rsquo;s not. He&rsquo;s a fan of the pod. Apparently</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a big fan of David saxes. So we&rsquo;re going to talk about the</p>
<p>military. And just as a general concept, I have a theme I was</p>
<p>going to float by y&rsquo;all think a lot of the talks and a lot of</p>
<p>the the zeitgeist is around the problem I want to solve. So I&rsquo;d</p>
<p>like you all to think about that. I think this will be a</p>
<p>celebration of people who are trying to solve important</p>
<p>problems in the world. So what are you solving for is going to</p>
<p>be the I think the theme of the event, what are you trying to</p>
<p>solve for? And so freeberg, if you can give maybe a little talk</p>
<p>to math, David, I would be great if the four besties gave a</p>
<p>little 15 minute solo talk, we&rsquo;re gonna have a lot of these</p>
<p>solo talks, position, hey, here&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m solving for. And</p>
<p>then conversations about freeberg, do you know, Dalio,</p>
<p>you should get Dalio, I think he&rsquo;d be great. I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Okay, and Catwood looks like I think Cathie Woods coming to</p>
<p>but by the way, there&rsquo;s a new video that Dalio just put out,</p>
<p>which is like the 45 minute animated documentary version of</p>
<p>his book. And really good. I watched it. I watched it. And I</p>
<p>thought it was really great. It&rsquo;s all about how empires rise</p>
<p>and fall. And it&rsquo;s pretty clear that he thinks we&rsquo;re a late</p>
<p>stage empire. And he talks about a lot of the things that we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>talking about on the show. And I watched it this week. I thought</p>
<p>it was exceptional. The book. Yeah, I thought it was really</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m halfway through. Oh, look at you guys coming around. You</p>
<p>gotta listen to me like you have to watch it on YouTube</p>
<p>because his animations are excellent. Very nice. Yeah. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>very accessible. I mean, it&rsquo;s incredibly, incredibly good.</p>
<p>Highly recommend. Yeah. I mean, look, I agree with you. One of</p>
<p>you guys get Dalio on the thing. Let&rsquo;s get him. Yeah. Dalio</p>
<p>reach out. I know we know you&rsquo;re listening. So I think the</p>
<p>question to ask Dalio is I think he is actually I think he&rsquo;s fan</p>
<p>of the show. Yeah. I think the question to ask Dalio is how do</p>
<p>you revitalize a late stage empire? That&rsquo;s right. That&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>good that is the question question. Can it be done? Well,</p>
<p>can it no can it be done? I think is the real question. All</p>
<p>in some it may well. I think can is too theoretical. I think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s more how would you do it? Yeah. Yeah. If it&rsquo;s possible,</p>
<p>what would the path be? And it&rsquo;s gotta be something about</p>
<p>building the pie, not shrinking it. That&rsquo;s for sure. May 15 16</p>
