    <p>I&rsquo;m in a very Daniel Plainview mood this week.</p>
<p>The there will be competition in me.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to see other people succeed.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right. Best scene ever.</p>
<p>You are the furthest from that character.</p>
<p>Like that is not your spirit animal.</p>
<p>Oh, there will be blood.</p>
<p>That guy, Daniel Day-Lewis, has nothing to do with you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve watched it a hundred times. Incredible.</p>
<p>You must be so stormy and roiled on the inside.</p>
<p>Oh, my gosh.</p>
<p>I mean, like, did you not see my roast at Saksa&rsquo;s birthday?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just I not see it.</p>
<p>I lived it. It was the most off color.</p>
<p>Disgusting, egregious, mean diatribe I&rsquo;ve ever heard.</p>
<p>My Lord, I have a competition in me.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like to see others succeed.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t stand that.</p>
<p>Jekyll is a good moderate.</p>
<p>Let your winners ride</p>
<p>Rain Man, David Saksa.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s said we open source it to the fans</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ve just gone crazy with it.</p>
<p>Love you, Wes.</p>
<p>Nice Queen of Kinwana.</p>
<p>I guess everybody wants to know, Chamath, you&rsquo;ve wound down two SPACs.</p>
<p>Thank you for doing this for IPOF specifically,</p>
<p>because people are replying to me every day asking, what are you going to SPAC?</p>
<p>But IPO, D and F, the money has been returned to investors.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s going to be returned, going to be returned to investors.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>And Bill Ackman, of course, he wound down his SPAC returning four billion.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s over 500 SPACs out there looking for deals.</p>
<p>Tell us why this decision?</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;ve raised 10 SPACs, six in technology and four in biotechnology,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ve done six deals, two in tech and two in biotech.</p>
<p>Four in tech.</p>
<p>Sorry, four in tech.</p>
<p>Four in tech, thank you. And two in biotech.</p>
<p>So the reason to shut it down is pretty straightforward.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, you know, when we launched these things,</p>
<p>the stock market was in a much different place than it is today.</p>
<p>And so over the last two years of looking at deals,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gotten harder and harder to find a good risk reward.</p>
<p>Now, why is that?</p>
<p>Well, the thing with the SPAC is you do a deal today,</p>
<p>but it doesn&rsquo;t usually close for six or seven months in the future.</p>
<p>And so you have to do a deal where you have a really good sense</p>
<p>that in six or seven months when the deal comes to close,</p>
<p>that the price will be the same or even higher than what it is today.</p>
<p>And if it isn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>all of the investors that you&rsquo;ve brought along in the SPAC</p>
<p>have a right to redeem, which is to say they file a notice</p>
<p>that says you can complete the deal, but I want my money back.</p>
<p>And what they get back is the initial $10</p>
<p>that they used to buy the stock in the first place,</p>
<p>because when we sold when we started this back, we sold stock at $10.</p>
<p>And so from my perspective, I was looking at this and I&rsquo;m like,</p>
<p>you know, this is a super volatile, ugly point in the market.</p>
<p>This last year has been really problematic.</p>
<p>I and I and I kind of said this last November and Nick,</p>
<p>we can we can play the clip after and we can come back to it.</p>
<p>But basically, my decision was that at this point</p>
<p>to do a deal would probably, you know, put a lot of capital at risk.</p>
<p>And in all of these deals, I&rsquo;m typically investing</p>
<p>$100 million at least in each of them.</p>
<p>And so I couldn&rsquo;t justify that.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t see a good risk reward.</p>
<p>And I thought the right thing to do, the responsible thing to do</p>
<p>was just to wind these things down.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;ll lose, I don&rsquo;t know, 10, 15, 20 million bucks</p>
<p>for having set these things up.</p>
<p>But we give everybody their money back that $10.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s actually better over the next five or six months</p>
<p>than what it&rsquo;ll otherwise do if you&rsquo;re invested in the market.</p>
<p>Now, that&rsquo;s a belief that I have.</p>
<p>But hopefully when people get the $10 back in the next few weeks,</p>
<p>if they want, they can go and put that money back in the market.</p>
<p>And hopefully they&rsquo;ll do well.</p>
<p>But, you know, from my perspective, the risk reward was not good.</p>
<p>Is part of the issue, the inventory that&rsquo;s available of great companies as well.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one of the things I heard speculated on CNBC,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard to convince a private company to go public.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s my experience.</p>
<p>You know, when I when I was talking to all of these CEOs</p>
<p>of these Silicon Valley companies,</p>
<p>initially, there was a lot of misunderstanding about what SPACs were.</p>
<p>And I think we were able to dispel that because we had some really</p>
<p>successful transactions.</p>
<p>Then there was a lot of interest in being a part of it.</p>
<p>In this phase, we were suffering from two very important things.</p>
<p>One was that valuations were just completely up in the air.</p>
<p>People had a huge question mark on late stage valuations</p>
<p>because we would come in.</p>
<p>We would do the work and we would say the company is worth X.</p>
<p>And that number typically was 50 or 60 percent lower</p>
<p>than their last private valuation.</p>
<p>And so when it came time for us to negotiate, you know, doing the deal,</p>
<p>even if the founder was roughly on board, the rest of the board was not</p>
<p>because a lot of them would have seen some pretty meaningful markdowns</p>
<p>in their private assets.</p>
<p>And when the company had enough money to kind of like, you know,</p>
<p>at least stay private for another year or so without having to raise money</p>
<p>on balance, those investors felt it was more prudent for them</p>
<p>to not take the mark and to not take the deal at such a lower discount.</p>
<p>So that was a big issue</p>
<p>that we ran into because every time we would price a deal again,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re trying to create a margin of safety for us and our investors again,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s going to take six to nine months to close a deal.</p>
<p>And so ideally, you want a valuation indigestion.</p>
<p>And then sorry, the second thing was just volatility.</p>
<p>So when you see volatility in the public markets,</p>
<p>you know, for a CEO, and I can understand this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s much easier to go public in a point where the markets are generally</p>
<p>going in one direction because it gives them the confidence</p>
<p>to be able to learn the ropes because it is a complicated process being public.</p>
<p>And when you introduce tremendous market based volatility,</p>
<p>independent of your company,</p>
<p>I think a lot of CEOs and CFOs and IR people</p>
<p>were a little nervous.</p>
<p>You want to take the risk.</p>
<p>And that was that was the second piece.</p>
<p>But by in a way, the first one was valuation.</p>
<p>We could not find market clearing prices.</p>
<p>Makes sense for assets.</p>
<p>And by the way, and I&rsquo;ll talk about one company in specific,</p>
<p>which just this week had a pretty public blow up around this whole issue.</p>
<p>And look, I&rsquo;ve been pretty clear about this since November.</p>
<p>The marginal trade should have been to be trimming risk.</p>
<p>And Nick, maybe you can play the clip, because I really want to make sure</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s very clear and on the record what I said almost an entire year ago.</p>
<p>Let me put crypto in the context of the markets and where we are today</p>
<p>at the end of the week after, you know, Q3 earnings in November of 2021.</p>
<p>We have the stock market at absolute all time highs.</p>
<p>Ripping. We have crypto at absolute all time highs.</p>
<p>Ripping. We have the art markets.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you guys saw Phillips and Christie&rsquo;s and Sotheby&rsquo;s this past week</p>
<p>at absolute all time highs.</p>
<p>Sold another vehicle for 25 million.</p>
<p>We have inflation at a 30 year high.</p>
<p>We have 10 year break evens at a 25 year high.</p>
<p>We have, you know, one point</p>
<p>some odd trillion dollars that we just approved last weekend.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re still horse trading on another three, you know, one point</p>
<p>eight trillion dollars of stimulus that we&rsquo;re going to put in.</p>
<p>And I think the the most important thing, which is</p>
<p>the two most important founders of our generation,</p>
<p>the two smartest people who have really consistently won</p>
<p>Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos have collectively sold more than 11 billion dollars</p>
<p>of their holdings this year alone.</p>
<p>And if you can&rsquo;t take all of that and decide for yourself</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s right for you and your family, you&rsquo;re doing yourself a disservice.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s important for me to never sort of like, you know,</p>
<p>be forced to tell folks whether I&rsquo;m buying or selling, although I&rsquo;m willing</p>
<p>to do it in moments where I think it&rsquo;s important.</p>
<p>But I think it&rsquo;s really important to understand the context.</p>
<p>And so I think like these folks that like think derisively</p>
<p>about individuals who are managing risk, I think it&rsquo;s really naive.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s it creates a lot of missed opportunity for them as well.</p>
<p>If the smartest people in the world</p>
<p>are now selling their core holdings that they told you they would never sell</p>
<p>and you are not reconsidering your position on things.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re either much smarter than them</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re being really, really reckless.</p>
<p>The reason I said all of those things.</p>
<p>Was because I was getting really worried about where we were.</p>
<p>And then and then I think on the heels of that, I published a tweet</p>
<p>and I and I said, I&rsquo;m starting to sell, you know,</p>
<p>and I sold like 100 million dollars or so five.</p>
<p>But then I was a systematic seller</p>
<p>through the end of last year and through this year</p>
<p>to try to manage my own liquidity, because it changed profoundly</p>
<p>as I saw what was happening in the markets.</p>
<p>So, you know, I think that it&rsquo;s just an important thing to call out</p>
<p>that things don&rsquo;t always go up.</p>
<p>And you have to pay attention to a mosaic of information</p>
<p>and you have to do the work yourself because, you know,</p>
<p>your situation is unique to you.</p>
<p>Nobody else understands it.</p>
<p>And so you can&rsquo;t outsource that decision to somebody else.</p>
<p>Obviously, you can use it as a guide.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s fair to say, you know, when the 13 F&rsquo;s of important</p>
<p>hedge funds come out, do I read them?</p>
<p>Of course, because I&rsquo;m trying to figure out, you know, what don&rsquo;t I know?</p>
<p>What may I be missing?</p>
<p>Maybe there&rsquo;s a great company in there that I that I should be taking a look at.</p>
<p>So, you know, I&rsquo;m not dissimilar to everybody else in that I use other people</p>
<p>that I look up to or respect as a leading indicator of what to buy.</p>
<p>But I still take responsibility for my own decisions,</p>
<p>and I manage my liquidity as best as I can based on my conditions.</p>
<p>And those are always changing.</p>
<p>And so I think this is just a good reminder that everybody else has to do the same.</p>
<p>So, Chamath, what do you think happens to the remaining 500?</p>
<p>Every SPAC sponsor friend of mine that I know is not seeking targets anymore.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all expecting to wind up and return capital.</p>
<p>How many of the 500 do you think will actually find a target?</p>
<p>And how many do you think all of remaining SPACs,</p>
<p>how many of them will wind up and return capital?</p>
<p>I mean, I think that there&rsquo;s still some really good deals to do.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not necessarily in tech, per se.</p>
<p>So, you know, I think you did a really great deal in ag tech.</p>
<p>I think that that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s really interesting.</p>
<p>So time will tell how that does.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s some really interesting deals in energy.</p>
<p>In fact, we spent a lot of time actually pivoting and spending time and energy</p>
<p>looking at, you know, everything from, you know,</p>
<p>producers of nat gas and oil to, you know, folks that were building terminals</p>
<p>to LNG facilities and the.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s just a very different return profile than what we were used to.</p>
<p>So I think if you can understand some of these other markets</p>
<p>and you can underwrite to a different rate of return.</p>
<p>Some decent deals will get done.</p>
<p>The overwhelming majority of the tech SPACs, I think, probably will just wind up.</p>
<p>Some folks will be really focused on trying to.</p>
<p>You know, monetize their founder, promote, so they&rsquo;ll do any kind of deal.</p>
<p>The problem, as you see, is even whether you do a good deal or bad deal</p>
<p>with the kind of volatility we&rsquo;re seeing in the market,</p>
<p>the likelihood is that it&rsquo;s going to trade down pretty significantly.</p>
<p>So I think most will not find a home.</p>
<p>I think some will find some really interesting targets in areas like energy,</p>
<p>I think are really interesting.</p>
<p>Agriculture, like what you did, Freeburg, I think is really interesting deal.</p>
<p>And then you know what?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll be an opportunity for us to retool the SPAC.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s going to go away.</p>
<p>I think that it is a useful tool in a toolbox of many tools.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s IPOs, there&rsquo;s direct listings.</p>
<p>There are SPACs.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s obviously private fundraising.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s convertible, there&rsquo;s structured deals.</p>
<p>So it is a tool.</p>
<p>And I think when used properly, it can be really helpful.</p>
<p>You know, for the companies that we worked with.</p>
<p>It would have been impossible for them to raise the quantums of capital</p>
<p>that they did primary capital from sophisticated hedge funds and mutual funds.</p>
<p>You know, we raised billions and billions of dollars for companies</p>
<p>like SoFi and Open Door.</p>
<p>And I think that that&rsquo;s going to go a long way for them to achieve their goals.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s going to be a good tool.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;re going to go through a washout of most of these folks</p>
<p>who are not going to be able to successfully find targets.</p>
<p>Saks, when we look at private companies, especially the late stage ones,</p>
<p>you and I are involved in a number of them.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re doing riffs, they&rsquo;ve got headwinds,</p>
<p>and their valuations are underwater in many cases.</p>
<p>How are they thinking about the public market windows, SPACs,</p>
<p>direct listings, or just a traditional IPO?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know that they are thinking about it.</p>
<p>I just think I think like going public seems like a fantasy at this point.</p>
<p>I think the whole public markets exit idea is frozen for two years.</p>
<p>Two years.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s yeah, I think that&rsquo;s probably what people are thinking.</p>
<p>What are these late stage companies that raised mega rounds</p>
<p>doing to work out valuation issues?</p>
<p>Because as Chamath just pointed out, with SPACs,</p>
<p>one of the problems was clearing market the late stage investors who came in.</p>
<p>Maybe they, you know, don&rsquo;t want to accept the haircut and valuation,</p>
<p>even if they have productive.</p>
<p>Probably not enough.</p>
<p>I mean, what they&rsquo;re doing is is using their war chest</p>
<p>to grow into their valuations, which is the smart strategy.</p>
<p>And if they&rsquo;re really smart, they&rsquo;ll be slashing their burn while they do that.</p>
<p>But yeah, it&rsquo;s no different than we&rsquo;ve talked about before.</p>
<p>I think the main significance of this past week</p>
<p>is that you had the Fed meeting, it raised another 75 basis points.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no surprise to that.</p>
<p>That was predicted.</p>
<p>What was new was the forecast.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re now saying that they expect to raise another one and a half percent.</p>
<p>Just two months ago at the last meeting,</p>
<p>they were saying 75 at this meeting, plus 50 after that.</p>
<p>Now they&rsquo;re saying 150 after this.</p>
<p>So, you know, in just two months, they&rsquo;ve they&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re now revised their forecast for an extra 100 basis points of rate increases.</p>
<p>Why? Because inflation is worse than they thought.</p>
<p>So things are worse than we thought two months ago.</p>
<p>The last inflation print didn&rsquo;t get better as fast as people wanted.</p>
<p>We talked about that last week.</p>
<p>Now the Fed is revising its forecast.</p>
<p>The trajectory is bad and getting worse.</p>
<p>And you finally had Powell kind of throw in the towel</p>
<p>on his rhetoric around soft landing.</p>
<p>I mean, first it was, well, we can raise rates and we won&rsquo;t have a recession.</p>
<p>Then it was we might have like a mild recession.</p>
<p>Now he&rsquo;s basically saying hard landing if you if you read</p>
<p>these FOMC comments.</p>
<p>So I think this was a really bad week for the economy.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re seeing it in the markets this week.</p>
<p>I mean, we are retracing almost within five percent of the June lows.</p>
<p>With the growth stocks being the ones that are hardest hit.</p>
<p>By the way, speaking of growth stocks, have you guys been following this</p>
<p>trials and tribulations with by Jews, which is like the one of the largest</p>
<p>valued private companies, but it&rsquo;s a private Indian tech company.</p>
<p>Essentially, I think like, you know, there was this delayed audit.</p>
<p>And Deloitte couldn&rsquo;t certify a bunch of things, and then finally</p>
<p>they were able to come up with a report that essentially showed</p>
<p>instead of like breaking even or making money,</p>
<p>they lost almost 600 million dollars this year and that</p>
<p>a lot of the revenue that they were booking were actually loans</p>
<p>to millions of Indian families</p>
<p>who had basically zero probability of paying them back.</p>
<p>So a lot of the revenue was not real as well.</p>
<p>And this is like a who&rsquo;s who of investors, it&rsquo;s everybody from,</p>
<p>you know, Sequoia, Tiger, UBS, BlackRock,</p>
<p>Chan Zuckerberg, it&rsquo;s incredible.</p>
<p>I think when the tide goes out, we find out. Right.</p>
<p>And this is what&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>The tide&rsquo;s out and you&rsquo;re going to find all the weakness in the system.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all going to get flushed.</p>
<p>I think this is a bit of an outlier, obviously, like I don&rsquo;t think that,</p>
<p>you know, all these companies that are worth 10s of billions of dollars</p>
<p>are running so close to the sun.</p>
<p>But it just goes to show you that, you know, how to how does.</p>
<p>How does this happen, like how</p>
<p>how do you not get a deal on this on the seed stage in series A,</p>
<p>we would ask for a data room, the person would say,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re the only investor asking for it.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re putting in, you know, 10% of the round.</p>
<p>These other people aren&rsquo;t even asking for it.</p>
<p>We said, OK, can we still see the data room?</p>
<p>And turned out there wasn&rsquo;t one.</p>
<p>People were just making bets.</p>
<p>They were making blind bets.</p>
<p>They were betting without even looking at their cards</p>
<p>or thinking about the other people&rsquo;s cards.</p>
<p>But this goes back to what Friedberg was saying before.</p>
<p>You know, I think I think there&rsquo;s a there&rsquo;s a.</p>
<p>A sliver of the retail investor base that is not dissimilar</p>
<p>to a sliver of the private equity and hedge fund and venture capital space,</p>
<p>which is these folks are not willing to do the work.</p>
<p>I think most people are.</p>
<p>And most people want to come to their own conclusions.</p>
<p>But some people want to just take the easy, momentum driven decision.</p>
<p>And they typically always get punished over time.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s this concept of adverse selection, which is that</p>
<p>the negative actors will find them will seek them out and it will be a match.</p>
<p>And so they&rsquo;ll ultimately get adversely selected into the deals that blow them up.</p>
<p>So the bad deals, what you&rsquo;re saying is the bad deals</p>
<p>would find the bad investors who don&rsquo;t do the work and then they spiral</p>
<p>and crash together.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a really brilliant observation. Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think I think the other that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m here.</p>
<p>I think the other thing is like you have this situation where</p>
<p>if it wasn&rsquo;t that it&rsquo;s folks outsourcing their diligence</p>
<p>to the person that did the round before it totally, you know.</p>
<p>Oh, Silver Lake did it.</p>
<p>Same problem. Tiger did it.</p>
<p>OK, these guys are very sophisticated investors.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t need to do the work.</p>
<p>It turned out you did because, you know, it was a very</p>
<p>you know, cavalier way of recognizing revenue.</p>
<p>There was a specific playbook here, too, that I don&rsquo;t know if you saw this</p>
<p>acts in the early stage where people would get their friends</p>
<p>to invest in the company or some, you know, high net worth individuals.</p>
<p>And then you look at the deal and the valuation didn&rsquo;t make sense.</p>
<p>And then you say, well, we would always ask how much money is each person</p>
<p>putting in? And we like, well, their normal bet size in the seed is 750</p>
<p>or 1.5 million.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re putting 50k into this or 100k. What&rsquo;s going on here?</p>
<p>And it was, oh, they&rsquo;re friends with them.</p>
<p>They worked at a previous company together.</p>
<p>They were in the same they went to the same college.</p>
<p>And so people were using social proof, but manipulating it</p>
<p>to get some other sucker at the table to pay full price and not do diligence.</p>
<p>Really strange behavior.</p>
<p>I was in Singapore this week.</p>
<p>There was a I had this great meeting with this young investor,</p>
<p>really dynamic guy, and he was telling me about a company in Indonesia</p>
<p>that he didn&rsquo;t invest in.</p>
<p>But it turned out that that this founder</p>
<p>was literally running two parallel sets of accounting systems.</p>
<p>And so he was, you know, showing a business and fundraising from this set.</p>
<p>But the the real books were over here and it looked a completely different system.</p>
<p>And it was basically like a Ponzi scheme.</p>
<p>And, you know, he was telling me it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s like impossible</p>
<p>to root these things out.</p>
<p>So what he said he relies on is like you have to have a network</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re doing these frontier country deals</p>
<p>where, you know, he says, I need to find at least 10 people that know this person</p>
<p>so that there is sort of like a moral social proof and moral diligence</p>
<p>that happens because that person will never try to commit something</p>
<p>that egregious in the face of all of their friends.</p>
<p>And so, you know, that&rsquo;s a mechanism of filtering this stuff out.</p>
<p>But I thought that was a really interesting way of of designing a diligence</p>
<p>process, at least in a frontier market here.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think you have that much time to do these really, you know, fast paced deals.</p>
<p>And the social proof matters less because you theoretically,</p>
<p>you know, are looking for signals of traction.</p>
<p>But there has to be a better systematic way of getting this diligence done,</p>
<p>because these things should be pretty obvious.</p>
<p>Saks did well before it&rsquo;s a well before it&rsquo;s a multi deca billion dollar company.</p>
<p>Saks last year, when people were moving really fast, saying they don&rsquo;t have time</p>
<p>for diligence, you&rsquo;re going to lose the deal, yada, yada.</p>
<p>How did you approach diligence during those peak periods?</p>
<p>And did you have those experiences where people were trying to push you to close</p>
<p>without talking to customers or looking at bank statements, yada, yada?</p>
<p>No, we wouldn&rsquo;t play that game because we always run SAS metrics.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s always the starting point for us.</p>
<p>But, you know, most SAS companies, they have SAS metrics.</p>
<p>I mean, they it&rsquo;s so standardized that it would be such a red flag if they didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think it might be companies that are, you know, have unusual business models</p>
<p>or maybe they would say something like that.</p>
<p>But no, we can never do a SAS investment without SAS metrics.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Well, this is a good segue, because right now, U.S.</p>
<p>venture capitalists are sitting on two hundred ninety billion dollars in dry powder.</p>
<p>We had talked about this last year, how much dry powder was there.</p>
<p>The market is obviously collapsed.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s a chart from our friends over at PitchBook.</p>
<p>Just extraordinary how much has built up and how much has been raised.</p>
<p>USVC funds raised one hundred and twenty one billion dollars</p>
<p>during the first half of this year, 2022.</p>
<p>So LP&rsquo;s still have an appetite, which kind of makes sense.</p>
<p>Investing into the down market for private companies</p>
<p>means you&rsquo;re going to get better deals and you have a 10 year horizon.</p>
<p>USVC has raised one hundred thirty nine billion in all of 2021.</p>
<p>So if you put those two numbers together,</p>
<p>yeah, you&rsquo;re looking at two hundred and sixty billion dollars in the last 18 months.</p>
<p>And this is all record numbers being put up on the board.</p>
<p>What does this say for private companies, Zach?</p>
<p>I dispute this analysis a little bit.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a couple of things going on that need to be taken into consideration.</p>
<p>First of all, new funds don&rsquo;t get announced till after the process completes.</p>
<p>And then, you know, it may even be some time after that</p>
<p>when the VC firm feels like they want to make the announcement.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t announce a fund until the process is completely over.</p>
<p>You get subject to all sorts of additional SEC rules.</p>
<p>So, you know, these funds might be announced in 2022,</p>
<p>but they may have actually been raised in 2021.</p>
<p>So that I think is a really important point.</p>
<p>Moreover, a lot of the funds may have already deployed capital before the crash.</p>
<p>So there was that, I think, remarkable story that we talked about months ago</p>
<p>in TechCrunch on how the latest Tiger Fund,</p>
<p>which wasn&rsquo;t even announced till March or April of 2022,</p>
<p>but it had already been two thirds deployed by the time they even announced it.</p>
<p>And so that was pretty stunning.</p>
<p>So I think that we don&rsquo;t really have a great sense of</p>
<p>how much of this so-called dry powder has already been deployed,</p>
<p>how much of it was really raised before the crash.</p>
<p>It is true that LP relationships with VC firms that have done well are sticky</p>
<p>and good LPs stick with their partners during a downturn.</p>
<p>So, look, I mean, the VC world&rsquo;s not going out of business or anything like that.</p>
<p>But I would tend to think that this is an overly optimistic, overly rosy scenario.</p>
<p>Do VCs have new funds that they&rsquo;re going to be ready to deploy</p>
<p>in great companies? Yes.</p>
<p>But does this mean it&rsquo;s going to be easy? No.</p>
<p>I think that the bar has gone up.</p>
<p>Valuations have gone down.</p>
<p>Founders looking at this tweet storm, I would not get lulled into a false sense of security.</p>
<p>Yeah, I agree with just to explain that.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s probably a six month lag on when these funds are announced.</p>
<p>The reason is there&rsquo;s 506 B and C designations.</p>
<p>Most people raise under 506 B, which means you cannot even say that you&rsquo;re fundraising.</p>
<p>Therefore, PitchBook can never have that data.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a lag and people were deploying at a very high velocity.</p>
<p>Therefore, this number could be off.</p>
<p>Thirty five people were deploying at a pace where they thought</p>
<p>you had to go back for a new fund every year, which is what it was looking like</p>
<p>in 2020, 2021.</p>
<p>You know, if that six month period might mean you&rsquo;ve deployed half the fund.</p>
<p>So but look, if if you just go back to a two and a half</p>
<p>or three year pace of deployment and before in 2021,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re at a one year pace of deployment, divide the availability of capital by two thirds.</p>
<p>I mean, you know, only one third as much will be deployed in any given year.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a significant reduction.</p>
<p>So, yeah, I think founders should just be aware that the market&rsquo;s going to be a lot tighter.</p>
<p>And I think given what we&rsquo;re seeing in the public markets this week,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t look to me like it&rsquo;s going to get any better.</p>
<p>It looks to me like we&rsquo;re headed for I mean, I call it a double dip recession.</p>
<p>I think a couple of months ago, that&rsquo;s exactly what it&rsquo;s looking like.</p>
<p>In fact, the Fed basically said as much.</p>
<p>The Fed said that would be just marginally positive next quarter.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;d bounce back to slightly positive growth on a real basis.</p>
<p>But then, you know, expect it to go negative again and, you know,</p>
<p>recession once all these interest rates kick in.</p>
<p>And by the way, I mean, kudos to Chamath for basically calling that,</p>
<p>you know, when the Fed just a couple of months ago was saying that so-called neutral</p>
<p>would be three to three and a half percent.</p>
<p>Chamath was saying, no, it&rsquo;s going to be four and a half, five percent plus.</p>
<p>Now the Fed just in two months has revised to saying that neutral is four point</p>
<p>six percent or something like that.</p>
<p>And and they don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s going to be any rate reductions in 2023.</p>
<p>So this is not looking good.</p>
<p>How much Chamath of the issue here is</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t the data that we&rsquo;re seeing, the ground truth</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re seeing, as you would often say, might be very different</p>
<p>than like the reports that are coming out.</p>
<p>People are talking about inflation from, you know, 60 days ago,</p>
<p>job reports that are 30 days old, 60 days old.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t really have live data.</p>
<p>It seems like our government doesn&rsquo;t use live data</p>
<p>when they make these decisions, is that the unfortunately?</p>
<p>Well, they unfortunately don&rsquo;t have access to it, really.</p>
<p>You know, they are they have empirical sampling.</p>
<p>But to say that, you know, the the US economy is automated in a way</p>
<p>where, you know, they can sit in front of some dashboard and,</p>
<p>you know, see in real time what the true on the ground data is</p>
<p>is not really accurate, unfortunately.</p>
<p>Maybe there&rsquo;s a Manhattan project type, you know, effort to do that</p>
<p>at some point for the United States, but it&rsquo;s not now.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give you a bit of bad news and a bit of good news.</p>
<p>And this is just me kind of, you know, again, looking at the mosaic</p>
<p>and and kind of judging where we are today.</p>
<p>The bad news is, I think that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to be a really tough, sticky time for the U.S.</p>
<p>consumer probably over the next 18 months.</p>
<p>And so I tend to think that,</p>
<p>you know, through the course of this year and through 2023</p>
<p>and possibly even a little bit of 24, it&rsquo;s going to be a grind.</p>
<p>Unemployment will go back up.</p>
<p>Inflation will be sticky.</p>
<p>Real earnings will shrink.</p>
<p>Consumption will ebb.</p>
<p>And earnings will not be that great.</p>
<p>But the silver lining is, I think that we are starting</p>
<p>a bottoming process for the equity markets.</p>
<p>And I think that by the end of this year or the early part of next year,</p>
<p>most of that will be done.</p>
<p>And the reason is that, you know, the equity markets, I think,</p>
<p>do a reasonable job of one looking at the bond market</p>
<p>and then to looking six to nine months into the future</p>
<p>and pricing in that future today.</p>
<p>And so by the end of this year, beginning of next year,</p>
<p>I think that we will have kind of bottomed and we&rsquo;ll start to build a base.</p>
<p>The thing to remind us, though, is that, you know, let&rsquo;s just say</p>
<p>a stock goes down 20, 50 percent, even if it rallies 50 percent from there,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s still 25 percent off from where people don&rsquo;t understand that.</p>
<p>And people don&rsquo;t understand that.</p>
<p>Climb back up the mountain.</p>
<p>So I would just I would just think, you know,</p>
<p>tell people that, you know, I think that David is right.</p>
<p>I think that it&rsquo;s going to we&rsquo;re going to feel this for a while.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s this inflation, as I&rsquo;ve said for a long time,</p>
<p>is going to be sticky and persistent.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re going to see Fed funds at or breaching five percent.</p>
<p>And but I think that in terms of, you know, risk assets</p>
<p>will bottom out by the end of this year, beginning of next year.</p>
<p>River, what are your thoughts?</p>
<p>You think we&rsquo;re in the process of bottoming out and it&rsquo;s going to be</p>
<p>a year of this kind of slog through the muck?</p>
<p>And what signs are you looking for that maybe we&rsquo;re getting out of it</p>
<p>or turning a corner?</p>
<p>I mean, Larry Summers had some good tweets this week.</p>
<p>The weird you know, the weird thing is Larry Summers seems to be.</p>
<p>Like almost trying to make the case and make certain points</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s not being listened to.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s so ironic and sad to watch</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s such a thoughtful economist and has such a great point of view</p>
<p>and experience to leverage here.</p>
<p>And clearly, you know, he was banging the drums last year.</p>
<p>No one was listening.</p>
<p>And then he got public about it.</p>
<p>And now he&rsquo;s more repeatedly public about things.</p>
<p>The point that he&rsquo;s made,</p>
<p>which I think plays into the political cycle question,</p>
<p>which is where the tension arises, is in order to resolve ultimately</p>
<p>the inflation problem,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to have to see a significant increment in unemployment and.</p>
<p>And so when you raise interest rates,</p>
<p>you know, generally purchasing goes down, demand goes down,</p>
<p>revenue goes down, layoffs happen, some businesses go bankrupt, et cetera.</p>
<p>So then there&rsquo;s this trickle in the economy of less people being employed.</p>
<p>And when that happens, it ultimately drives.</p>
<p>A political response, which is, hey, we&rsquo;re losing our jobs.</p>
<p>People start asking their representatives do something about this in Congress.</p>
<p>And then these programs and these things get passed,</p>
<p>which themselves are inflationary.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s very hard to predict ultimately</p>
<p>when and how this all gets resolved, because we seem to have an administration</p>
<p>that is enacting and embracing</p>
<p>inflationary policies to support what they consider to be economic growth</p>
<p>and improved employment conditions in this country.</p>
<p>And the unfortunate effect of many of those policies is inflation.</p>
<p>And then it forces this difficult central bank decision making cycle.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s a tension right now that doesn&rsquo;t seem to have a clear path</p>
<p>to resolution.</p>
<p>That is why it&rsquo;s very hard to have a clear prediction here.</p>
<p>We also have a very significant question overhanging</p>
<p>all of these markets related to the price of energy,</p>
<p>which is a key input to so many industries and drives cost</p>
<p>as well as food and also the military conflict in Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>And, you know, and then there&rsquo;s in the financial markets,</p>
<p>this big overhang question on what&rsquo;s going to happen with various countries</p>
<p>that may default on their debt, as well as China&rsquo;s real estate bubble bursting.</p>
<p>So I made this point, I think, a few episodes ago,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s no easy answer that I can just say deterministically.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s my prediction of what&rsquo;s going to happen.</p>
<p>As Chamath uses the term, I think it&rsquo;s a great term.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s this mosaic of things that are under under consideration right now.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a tension between them all.</p>
<p>And and that&rsquo;s what makes it difficult.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, I didn&rsquo;t really answer the question, but that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s kind of how</p>
<p>I think about it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of geopolitical risk.</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;re kind of, you know, ignoring what happened this week</p>
<p>where Putin basically is putting nukes back on the table.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;m not saying that&rsquo;s likely to happen, but.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how, again, I don&rsquo;t know how this market</p>
<p>gets a lot better with the risk of war three over our heads.</p>
<p>I mean, who wants to enter the market with that on the table?</p>
<p>And by the way, the nukes, just just to be clear, you know,</p>
<p>you can hear certain military commanders speaking publicly about this.</p>
<p>But in the Russian military playbooks,</p>
<p>there is specifically defined actions</p>
<p>that can lead to tactical nuclear weapon use in the field.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no direct indication that these things are going to be used right away.</p>
<p>But the as a sack says, there&rsquo;s like this weird</p>
<p>like turning up the volume happening on, hey, maybe we&rsquo;re getting closer to a point</p>
<p>where if Putin is having tactical failure in this conflict,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s more weaponry he can use that has greater impact.</p>
<p>And unfortunately, there are these tactical nukes in his arsenal.</p>
<p>And, you know, a guy that maybe has a certain psychology</p>
<p>that has, as our friends have said, his back against the wall.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not a person who in his career</p>
<p>or in his history has ever acquiesced to defeat.</p>
<p>Alex Karp was on CNBC.</p>
<p>He was really, really sharp and concise about this, which is that, you know,</p>
<p>in the West, when leaders fail in their objectives,</p>
<p>they just get elected out and somebody else takes their place. Yeah.</p>
<p>But for somebody like Putin, there is nobody to take his place</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a very zero sum situation.</p>
<p>And so his actions will, as a result, also be zero sum.</p>
<p>And I think, folks, he&rsquo;s never acquiesced in his life.</p>
<p>And yeah, yeah, we&rsquo;ve never we&rsquo;ve never really kind of like</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t understand well what zero sum decision making looks like</p>
<p>when it comes to stuff like this.</p>
<p>He needs the Golden Bridge, right?</p>
<p>You need to give him the golden job.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ll just say two things.</p>
<p>One is that.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s been made pretty clear</p>
<p>that both India and China will not stand beside Russia</p>
<p>if they do something like this.</p>
<p>And I think that that is important because they still are the two biggest</p>
<p>purchasers of of Russian oil.</p>
<p>And so I think that matters a lot because you&rsquo;re talking about a lot of revenue</p>
<p>that would that would go away.</p>
<p>And then the second is I mentioned this last week,</p>
<p>and this may sound dumb to some of you, but don&rsquo;t sleep on the Russian mothers.</p>
<p>And what happened this.</p>
<p>Oh, you&rsquo;re 100 percent right on that.</p>
<p>Well, what happened this week was really interesting,</p>
<p>which is that he calls up all these reservists.</p>
<p>These reservists are not coming from the major cities of Russia.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re starting to see protests.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re starting to see young people say, I don&rsquo;t want to do this.</p>
<p>Yeah. And who&rsquo;s that really activating?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s activating the moms. Yeah.</p>
<p>And so I don&rsquo;t lose on the Russian moms.</p>
<p>Three hundred people are being drafted, you know, to basically go fight.</p>
<p>And I actually think David&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Oh, sorry. Sorry. Go ahead.</p>
<p>The question I have for you is, do you think I know you don&rsquo;t agree with this,</p>
<p>but do you think the strategy is to back him into a corner</p>
<p>and then have this like rhetoric spike to then force a resolution?</p>
<p>I know it&rsquo;s a danger strategy. It&rsquo;s a crazy chess move.</p>
<p>But do you think that&rsquo;s actually what the West is thinking?</p>
<p>I see no evidence that we have any</p>
<p>intentions of seeking a diplomatic off ramp.</p>
<p>I see no evidence that they&rsquo;re looking for to give him a golden bridge.</p>
<p>Like you said, then do you think they&rsquo;re trying to break him and have regime?</p>
<p>I think Biden stated the policy, which is this man cannot remain in power.</p>
<p>I think he blurted out the truth of his policy.</p>
<p>This is a regime change policy. That&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re going for.</p>
<p>They are backing him into a corner.</p>
<p>Jake, I thought that you were right this whole time, which is</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re going to build a golden bridge.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to find a way to egress this guy.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m now sort of in the David camp, which is I think that.</p>
<p>The stated strategy of the Western alliance</p>
<p>is essentially to cause him to make such a categorically catastrophic mistake</p>
<p>so as to become a pariah, so as to either get overthrown or, you know, something.</p>
<p>So I do think that on balance, the risk is now for things to escalate,</p>
<p>maybe not in quantity, and I&rsquo;ll use this word in the wrong way,</p>
<p>but, you know, quote, unquote, like the intensity of of it.</p>
<p>So I think David&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a lot of pressure to the economy and to the high risk assets.</p>
<p>High risk is a high risk strategy.</p>
<p>We got a good thing going over here.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see the need for all this risk.</p>
<p>So look, and the risk would be the reward.</p>
<p>What would you see the reward if Putin was removed?</p>
<p>Oh, my Lord.</p>
<p>Well, it depends who replaces him.</p>
<p>What if we get a hardliner?</p>
<p>You got to remember, Putin&rsquo;s taken out all the liberal reformers.</p>
<p>All that&rsquo;s left are hardliners.</p>
<p>So I know I know there&rsquo;s moms protesting in the streets, but he&rsquo;s also under</p>
<p>intense pressure from his his right wing.</p>
<p>You know, he&rsquo;s got hawks on his side who basically have been criticizing him</p>
<p>for making this a special limited military operation instead of a war.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like, why do you try to do this with 200000 troops?</p>
<p>We should have gone in heavy with a million.</p>
<p>So is that right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s criticism internally.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a New York Times article about this.</p>
<p>He has his own, you know, military hardliners in his security state, his hawks.</p>
<p>So so he&rsquo;s not just under pressure from peaceniks who are protesting in the streets.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s also under pressure from hardliners in his own government</p>
<p>who think he&rsquo;s been too soft.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s a challenging situation.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s and he&rsquo;s he&rsquo;s going to be 70 years old.</p>
<p>How many years does he have left?</p>
<p>We just need to contain him for a decade was on our side.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t contain him for more and more decade.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my best idea.</p>
<p>Contain him for a decade.</p>
<p>The thing I have the most trouble with is if you look at the media portrayal of this.</p>
<p>So I said last week when we had this successful counteroffensive</p>
<p>that maybe we&rsquo;ll get what we want, which is Russian morale collapses.</p>
<p>They just tuck their tail between their legs and go back to Moscow.</p>
<p>Or maybe, you know, the Russians really do see this war is existential for them.</p>
<p>Putin sees it as existential for himself and he escalates.</p>
<p>Well, what happened this week?</p>
<p>We went up a rung on the escalatory ladder.</p>
<p>Basically, Putin drew down 300000 more troops</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s basically indicated his his willingness to use tactical nukes.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s basically said, I&rsquo;m not bluffing.</p>
<p>So now what is the reaction in the American press?</p>
<p>He must be bluffing.</p>
<p>I mean, that basically is the reaction.</p>
<p>And look, I don&rsquo;t know how you know that.</p>
<p>You know, in poker, what you in poker, what do we do</p>
<p>when someone might be we put them on a range?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called a hand range, right? Yes.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t possibly know exactly what they&rsquo;re going to do or what cards are holding.</p>
<p>So you put them on a range of possible hands and then you evaluate the story</p>
<p>in light of their past actions.</p>
<p>What do they do before the flop on the flop?</p>
<p>And you basically come to an assessment of what is likely based on their story.</p>
<p>Now, take Putin&rsquo;s story.</p>
<p>Like Freiburg said, he&rsquo;s never backed down in his life from anything.</p>
<p>He has said this war is existential.</p>
<p>You know, he basically threatened to invade.</p>
<p>And so he did.</p>
<p>I mean, like, I don&rsquo;t know how you can immediately jump to the conclusion.</p>
<p>This is just a bluff.</p>
<p>Maybe it is, but.</p>
<p>Well, it could still be it could still be a bluff.</p>
<p>But then to your point, the range of outcomes does include shoving on the river,</p>
<p>moving all in.</p>
<p>He could move all in.</p>
<p>I mean, he&rsquo;s a KGB agent.</p>
<p>Do you want to play poker with a KGB agent with nukes?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>And so, Jason, you said throughout this guy&rsquo;s a madman.</p>
<p>Well, exactly.</p>
<p>I mean, personally, I think he&rsquo;s more like a ruthless mafia boss than a madman.</p>
<p>But but let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re right, that he is a madman.</p>
<p>What is the story about what we&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>that makes sense if he is a madman?</p>
<p>Why would we want to basically back him into a corner like that?</p>
<p>Why wouldn&rsquo;t we give him the gold and offer him?</p>
<p>And by the way, just on this idea that no one would ever use tactical nukes.</p>
<p>Let me just give you three data points.</p>
<p>First of all, we use them.</p>
<p>We dropped two atomic bombs on Japan and to end World War Two.</p>
<p>We could have won that war without doing it, but we didn&rsquo;t want to lose the troops.</p>
<p>Well, no, wait.</p>
<p>Those weren&rsquo;t Japanese.</p>
<p>Those are just they were tactical nuke sized atomic bombs.</p>
<p>Number two, MacArthur wanted to use</p>
<p>20 to 30 atomic bombs to end the Korean War.</p>
<p>He had a whole plan.</p>
<p>Truman fired him.</p>
<p>He thought he basically had jumped the shark.</p>
<p>But MacArthur was the most respected and admired American in 1950.</p>
<p>And the reason why Truman could not run for your elections</p>
<p>because he fired MacArthur, MacArthur would have used</p>
<p>basically the equivalent of tactical nukes to win the Korean War.</p>
<p>And his plan to prevent China from reinvading from the north</p>
<p>was to irradiate the border so completely that Chinese troops cannot go through it.</p>
<p>Keep in mind, there wasn&rsquo;t as many nukes at the time.</p>
<p>So we weren&rsquo;t up against nine different nuclear enabled countries.</p>
<p>But I understand that we had an American commander ahead of our military</p>
<p>who was willing to use nukes to win a war.</p>
<p>So this idea that he wouldn&rsquo;t I mean, we&rsquo;ve been willing to do that.</p>
<p>And the third example is obviously the Cuban missile crisis.</p>
<p>All of Kennedy&rsquo;s military advisers were willing to get to use nukes.</p>
<p>I mean, and the best thing Kennedy did was not listen to his military advisers.</p>
<p>They were all super hawkish.</p>
<p>And Kennedy, what did he do?</p>
<p>He looked for a way out. He looked for a compromise.</p>
<p>He sent Bobby Kennedy to go cut a secret deal with the Russians</p>
<p>where Kennedy agreed to pull the Jupiter missiles out of Turkey</p>
<p>if the Russians would pull their missiles out of Cuba.</p>
<p>And they lied to the American public about it</p>
<p>because he didn&rsquo;t want to be perceived as backing down.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s the kind of, you know, flexibility and mental acuity</p>
<p>that I think you would need in a nuclear showdown to avoid a catastrophe.</p>
<p>If things do escalate to the point of a nuclear showdown,</p>
<p>do we believe that we have leadership on the level of a Jack Kennedy</p>
<p>or Bobby Kennedy who can basically show the flexibility and adaptability</p>
<p>to cut a deal to basically pull us back from the brink?</p>
<p>Yeah, it doesn&rsquo;t seem like that.</p>
<p>What was Biden&rsquo;s response?</p>
<p>It was he gave this speech to the United Nations in response to Putin.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s more of the same as more of this, as I call it, the Abe Simpson speech.</p>
<p>This old man, you know, yelling at the cloud.</p>
<p>I mean, he&rsquo;s basically just yelling at a teleprompter.</p>
<p>Now, I think the strategically smart play would have been to say, listen, Putin,</p>
<p>you said that you want the people of Ukraine to decide where these territories go.</p>
<p>OK, we can hold a referendum, but we want to administer by the United Nations.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;ll have so it&rsquo;ll have some credibility behind it.</p>
<p>I mean, why not throw that out there as a potential way to get diplomacy started?</p>
<p>It felt like at the end of last year.</p>
<p>You guys remember, I thought like conflict was likely this year.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that the conditions that.</p>
<p>I was referencing have really gotten better, I think they&rsquo;ve gotten worse.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why I think we all talk about this in a rational way,</p>
<p>meaning like how the conscious mind would, you know,</p>
<p>debate the merits and and challenges and risks of having a golden bridge or</p>
<p>continuing conflict.</p>
<p>But if you look historically, the US has often been</p>
<p>in the middle of or at the tail end of.</p>
<p>Some either recessionary cycle or inflationary cycle when conflict</p>
<p>escalated externally, wag the dog, you&rsquo;re referring to.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t I don&rsquo;t know if I would call it that, but I think that there is.</p>
<p>An innate human anxiety when things aren&rsquo;t going well, you feel like you have to do</p>
<p>something about it and you&rsquo;re either going to have internal conflict or external</p>
<p>conflict as a result to try and resolve when when things are going great, the</p>
<p>economy is booming.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t enter a war, you don&rsquo;t start a conflict with a nation when when people</p>
<p>are happy at home, when your constituents and and the</p>
<p>unemployment rate is low and job wage growth is high, the economy</p>
<p>is growing. Are you referring to the United States or Russia in this case?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m referring to the US. And I know I just curious if you&rsquo;re coming out of COVID</p>
<p>and coming out of the big question marks that loomed over our economy at the end</p>
<p>of last year, around inflation, economic</p>
<p>growth, interest rates and the effect.</p>
<p>And now we&rsquo;re in the middle of the turmoil, markets are down 30%.</p>
<p>And in some cases, 70 to 80% for high growth markets.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a there&rsquo;s an inevitability now that unemployment is going to rise, there</p>
<p>is an inevitability now that the economy is going to contract.</p>
<p>Leadership is more likely in that scenario to find an outlet to find a place</p>
<p>of conflict. And I don&rsquo;t think I explained why in this theory.</p>
<p>Explain why? I understand the concept.</p>
<p>Is that what you&rsquo;re saying? Freeberg wag the dog?</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a conscious decision.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that it&rsquo;s like, hey, let&rsquo;s go start a war with Russia because the</p>
<p>economy is bad. I think it&rsquo;s this anxiety, the economy is bad, and there&rsquo;s not a</p>
<p>lot we can do about it. And over here, on the other hand, there&rsquo;s a problem and</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something we can do about it, we can build strength, and we can build</p>
<p>integrity. And we can build support, and we can get people to get behind something</p>
<p>together. And we can get something to create a driving mechanism to achieve</p>
<p>something big, like a distraction, you&rsquo;re saying? Yeah, yeah. And I don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>that psychology is as simple as a distraction or a wag the dog or hey, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not even as simple as the military industrial complex, we&rsquo;ll see revenue</p>
<p>growth, and wage growth, and that&rsquo;ll drive the economy. But I think all those</p>
<p>things together are true. And I think in whole, we&rsquo;re we are more likely to want</p>
<p>to pursue conflict right now than we were even a year ago. You buy that</p>
<p>chamath? I think he&rsquo;s more right than wrong. I think that when things aren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>easy. You need to find sort of distractions, essentially, to get people</p>
<p>to focus on other things so that the core problem isn&rsquo;t as obvious. We have</p>
<p>in the United States, I think, yeah, let&rsquo;s go create another problem that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>solvable. Yeah, like the best I think the best way that I can describe this as I</p>
<p>see it as institutional rot. And the more that we&rsquo;re left to our own devices,</p>
<p>that amount of institutional decay becomes more and more obvious. Our</p>
<p>governments don&rsquo;t work the way that they should. You know, our state assemblies</p>
<p>are basically co opted by special interests. The federal institutions we</p>
<p>rely on to make rules are not that great. enormous amounts of money get wasted</p>
<p>every day. And as more and more people become aware of these things. It&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>the trend is just so bad, you know, civic engagement goes down, everything</p>
<p>just gets worse. And so when you take that, and then on top of that, you sit</p>
<p>it on a on a poor economy. That is a real powder keg, I think. And so folks</p>
<p>like to I think if you&rsquo;re a politician, it&rsquo;s easier to kind of go and point to</p>
<p>Taiwan and say, you know, we&rsquo;re going to go and defend these folks if there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>war, point to Russia and say this point to all these other things. It&rsquo;s a whether</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s implicit, as Friedberg says, or it&rsquo;s more explicit of a strategy, I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know. But the underlying cause is the same, which is that if the foundation of</p>
<p>the house is not strong, and you&rsquo;re not sure what to do to fix it, or you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have the courage to fix it. The better strategic alternative is to distract and</p>
<p>talk about your neighbor&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>Coming out of coming out of the financial crisis in 2008 2009. Obama</p>
<p>recommitted to Afghanistan and sent 17,000 troops to Afghanistan in early</p>
<ol start="2009">
<li>
<p>When he took office, we entered the Persian Gulf with the Gulf War in</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Coming out of the Great Recession, or the the mild recession 1990 to 1991</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>2000 2001.com crash. We, you know, we obviously entered, entered Iraq.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, that was post nine, post 911. But it was also a risk. But it was also</p>
<p>in the midst of a recession and coming out of the but that was that one was</p>
<p>clearly reaction is that you buy this, you think this is a wag the dog or,</p>
<p>and by the way, you can do the same, you can do the same analysis on the time we</p>
<p>entered the Korean War, and the time we entered the Vietnam War, they were both</p>
<p>tied to recessions. And, and so I don&rsquo;t I don&rsquo;t know, I don&rsquo;t know how explicit</p>
<p>this this action and behavior is. But I just think there&rsquo;s some data to it.</p>
<p>There was a study that just came out by Tufts University on American military</p>
<p>interventions throughout American history. And what they found was that</p>
<p>we had the least in the period before the Cold War, then the second most was from the during</p>
<p>the Cold War. But actually, the most hyperactive period of American military</p>
<p>interventions was post Cold War. So since the unipolar moment, even though it&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>the safest period for America, right, we haven&rsquo;t explained unipolar for people don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>just that there&rsquo;s only one great power in the system. Before during the Cold War is a</p>
<p>bipolar world, whereas basically America versus the Soviet Union, and you obviously had the,</p>
<p>you know, NATO and the Western Alliance, the so called free world, and then you receive</p>
<p>check and balance proceed, you&rsquo;d have the Warsaw Pact on on the other side, we have</p>
<p>unipolar moving to buy. Well, it was it was Yeah, we were unipolar for a couple of decades.</p>
<p>But now we&rsquo;re moving towards multipolar, or at least bipolar with China.</p>
<p>Yeah, multipolar would be maybe including India, maybe including India, Brazil,</p>
<p>China in the future in the future. But But so the irony is that the safer America has become,</p>
<p>the more we&rsquo;ve gotten militarily involved overseas. And part of that is because there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>no great power in the system to oppose us. But it&rsquo;s also gotten us in a lot of trouble. I mean,</p>
<p>all of these wars in the Middle East, that cost us something like $8 trillion. Another survey cost</p>
<p>of war study, the direct number of deaths from these wars from the war on terror was over a</p>
<p>million lives lost $8 trillion. And that doesn&rsquo;t even include the excess mortality caused by the</p>
<p>destruction of infrastructure, wastewater treatment, you know, famine, all that kind of</p>
<p>stuff, which could be as high as 5 million, you know, the crazy part about that sex, that $8</p>
<p>trillion, if we had deployed that in energy independence, solar, nuclear, whatever, the</p>
<p>whole reason to be in the Middle East was oil and energy. And we could have just deployed that to</p>
<p>be energy independent in the West and not had all of this pain, but not the whole I mean, not the</p>
<p>whole reason. I think the reason to be in Afghanistan was to kill with the exception of 911.</p>
<p>And maybe we could have done that without taking over the whole country and gone on this 20 year</p>
<p>nation could have been done very strategically. I mean, actually, that was really proven when</p>
<p>well, first of all, we did kill. We did kill bin Laden in Pakistan, with just a raid by the seals</p>
<p>in infiltration to occupy that country. And then more recently, we finally got so we&rsquo;re hearing in</p>
<p>Afghanistan drone using a drone after we left the country. So what the hell do we need to be there</p>
<p>for? We don&rsquo;t 20 years when we could kill these guys. So I&rsquo;m using drones and you know, a helicopter</p>
<p>team. Yeah, this is where we needed to have an adversary who could check our power, it would</p>
<p>have been healthier is I guess the premise to the tough study. Right. But But look, I think to</p>
<p>freebirds point is it? Do we become more militaristic when things aren&rsquo;t going well at home?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know. But it feels to me, like just in general, over the last 30 years, we&rsquo;ve become</p>
<p>hyper militaristic. It&rsquo;s the use of military force is typically the first option. And we resort to</p>
<p>it too quickly. And we don&rsquo;t use diplomacy enough. And you can see that in just the number of lives</p>
<p>lost the failure of these wars, and the enormous deficit we&rsquo;re running. As you know, sex, I can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>stand Trump. The two things he got right, no wars. And he was the dictator whisperer, that guy knew</p>
<p>how to talk to a dictator. You know, whether it was North Korea, China, Russia, he just knew how</p>
<p>to bond with them. It was like a superpower for him. Okay, we have three directions keeps us out</p>
<p>of war is great. You know, I mean, it&rsquo;s literally his only saving grace. All right. Gentlemen, we</p>
<p>have to talk about what&rsquo;s going on in Iran. We have to talk about the Wall Street editorial boards,</p>
<p>California, talk about talk about talk about Newsom, because there&rsquo;s a bunch of energy stuff</p>
<p>happening in the United States, I think is important. All right. So the Wall Street Journal</p>
<p>editorial board, which obviously has a side wrote an op ed on California&rsquo;s grid issues, some of the</p>
<p>quotes from the op ed, California can barely keep the lights on as its climate policies,</p>
<p>bite the electric grid, but Gavin Newsom is undaunted on Friday, he signed no fewer than 40</p>
<p>new climate bills to amp up California&rsquo;s green energy stock shock experiment, even as gasoline</p>
<p>prices nationwide have fallen to an average of 368 a gallon. Californians are still paying 545</p>
<p>a gallon California&rsquo;s electric rates are already more than double those in neighboring states.</p>
<p>This is what happens when politicians try to eliminate fossil fuels with a Molotov cocktail</p>
<p>of regulation taxes and renewable mandates and subsidies. The coda to this is I&rsquo;ll send it to</p>
<p>you, Nick, but can you please play the clip as well of Rashida Tlaib trying to skewer Jamie</p>
<p>Diamond where he just destroys her? That&rsquo;s embarrassing. That was embarrassing. I mean,</p>
<p>we should play it. I mean, it&rsquo;s she made no sense. Nick, can you play that clip, please?</p>
<p>You have all committed, as you all know, to transition the emissions from lending</p>
<p>and investment activities to line with pathways to net zero in 2050. You know, what the International</p>
<p>Energy Agency has said is required to meet our goal global 2050 net zero targets of limiting</p>
<p>global temperature rise to 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit or 1.5 degrees Celsius. So no new fossil fuel</p>
<p>production starting today. So that&rsquo;s like zero. So I would like to ask all of you and go down the list</p>
<p>because, again, you all have agreed to doing this. Please answer with a simple yes or no.</p>
<p>Does your bank have a policy against funding new oil and gas products, Mr. Diamond?</p>
<p>Absolutely not. And that would be the road to hell for America.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s fine. That&rsquo;s fine, sir. You know what? Everybody that got relief from student</p>
<p>loans has a bank account with your bank should probably take out their account and close their</p>
<p>account. The fact that you&rsquo;re not even there to help relieve many of the folks that are in debt,</p>
<p>extreme debt because of student loan debt and you&rsquo;re out there criticizing it.</p>
<p>My favorite was when she said sell us this. That was the I was like, okay.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just so much theatrics.</p>
<p>The brochure to labor represents the 13th district congressional district in Michigan.</p>
<p>The median age in that district is 35.9 years old. The 2020 poverty rate is 28.2%. So more than</p>
<p>almost one in three people. And the 2020 median household income is $37,601. So you know, she</p>
<p>represents a group of people that, you know, I think, at best is lower middle class. And the</p>
<p>idea that she doesn&rsquo;t even basically understand what would happen in her district, if you actually</p>
<p>did not have cheap LNG. Again, just kind of speaks to the institutional kind of decay in</p>
<p>Washington. She is not the person that should be advocating for this. Like, you know, it&rsquo;s districts</p>
<p>like this more than any other that don&rsquo;t have the money to spend on, you know, very expensive</p>
<p>solar installations that cost 30 and $40,000. These are the districts that need coal, coal fired</p>
<p>plants, LNG oil, to keep going, to sort of minimize the impacts of inflation. And so you</p>
<p>know, that was just like a grandstanding moment moving to California hearings, because these are</p>
<p>important discussions, and they&rsquo;ve become theatrics. And this is a chance to educate the public with</p>
<p>some charts and data. She&rsquo;s either so hungry for power that she actually doesn&rsquo;t care about her</p>
<p>constituents. Or she&rsquo;s scientifically and numerically illiterate. That&rsquo;s I think the</p>
<p>latter is probably the issue here. And so this is this is what&rsquo;s such a shame on the on the on the</p>
<p>other side, you know, at the end at the other end of the coast in California. The cost of power</p>
<p>generation, just so you guys know, has fallen by 90% when you look at renewables. And that is</p>
<p>because of a good job that the federal government did in introducing subsidies that essentially</p>
<p>gave the right sets of incentives for people to build this infrastructure. But while the cost of</p>
<p>generating renewable power has fallen by 90%, you know, virtually, it&rsquo;s on par and it&rsquo;s cheaper than</p>
<p>any other form of generation, your electricity costs have doubled and are probably going to</p>
<p>double again in a state like California. So you know, we&rsquo;re catering our, our utility rates by,</p>
<p>you know, seven to 11%. Every year, that is unsustainable in California. And what do you have</p>
<p>a different version of the same flu that Rashida Tlaib has, which is you run forward to kind of</p>
<p>virtue signal and to try to do all of these things. You don&rsquo;t spend enough time to really</p>
<p>understand what&rsquo;s happening on the ground, and you make it impossible for people to make the</p>
<p>decisions to actually be resilient for themselves. At the end of the day, there are 10s of utilities</p>
<p>in America, but there are 100 million households. And the only path to energy independence is to</p>
<p>get every single 100 million household to be resilient, which means they need their own solar</p>
<p>panels, they need battery storage, they need their own potable water. And all of these systems are</p>
<p>now affordable and available. And now the federal government with the IRA has created the financial</p>
<p>incentives to pull it forward. So I don&rsquo;t know, I just think like this is a hugely stark reminder</p>
<p>about how poorly our energy policy has been managed. And if you leave it to the hands of</p>
<p>the progressive left, they will do things that don&rsquo;t map to what people on the ground actually</p>
<p>need people in California, most people in California cannot pay utility rates that are</p>
<p>going to double every six and seven years. Just like people in the congressional 13th District</p>
<p>of Michigan cannot afford to pay for solar, if Rashida Tlaib is able to get, you know,</p>
<p>all these banks and not finance LNG, coal and, and, and other forms of hydrocarbons as a bridge fuel</p>
<p>to look at all 40 of these bills independently. And you have to think about any bills. I mean,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s reading these things? What is in these things? I mean, each one has to be addressed</p>
<p>individually, like one of them could be to help people put solar panels on top of schools and</p>
<p>batteries in there, that could be a good bill. But there definitely needs to be have that mechanism</p>
<p>at the federal level, the IRA passed an incredible set of incentives, both for the producers of these</p>
<p>things. And for the for the end companies that actually deploy them. Yeah. And so we&rsquo;ve solved</p>
<p>that problem, you know, so I just think like, it just goes to show you a ton of regulation</p>
<p>does not actually add and get to the solution that we want. The government will not solve</p>
<p>your problems. I hate to be the bearer of bad news. But they are going to make things more</p>
<p>complicated, and more expensive. And the resilience that you expect out of your utility infrastructure,</p>
<p>by the way, we saw just what happened last week, there was a massive fire and a massive battery</p>
<p>installation that California installed 182 gigawatt system, megawatt system. Could you</p>
<p>imagine if that had actually lit on fire two weeks earlier in the middle of this crazy heat wave that</p>
<p>we had? So even even utility scale renewables are very complicated projects to undertake.</p>
<p>Look at Texas, I mean, people are dying there, because the grid keeps going down.</p>
<p>It is much safer and more reliable. If is if every homeowner in the United States took</p>
<p>responsibility, and, and use these incentives to basically become your own little virtual power</p>
<p>plant, and you will technologies there. I mean, people are getting generators for natural gases,</p>
<p>backups, we&rsquo;re gonna have to figure out how to take the load off the grid and build resiliency</p>
<p>into it. I don&rsquo;t know if you guys saw in a related story that all this ESG stuff is kind of coming to</p>
<p>a head. But Dilbert got canceled this week, and like 200 newspapers. Did you see this?</p>
<p>What? Yeah, so possible.</p>
<p>Well, because he&rsquo;s been going after ESG in his cartoon. And so I&rsquo;m interested in your take on</p>
<p>this. But here, I don&rsquo;t know the characters in Dilbert, except for Dilbert. But he says,</p>
<p>this person who&rsquo;s in charge says our ESG score will drop if we open a new factory that adds co2</p>
<p>to the atmosphere. But we can balance that out by adding more diversity to our board.</p>
<p>And I guess the cat says, how much co2 do you plan to add? And he said, one non nine</p>
<p>binary board members were showing the ES and the G being put together makes no sense.</p>
<p>But that that panel obviously got him canceled.</p>
<p>What does he mean? He&rsquo;s canceled like he was fired from national newspapers.</p>
<p>I think one of the 177 newspapers because they&rsquo;re all part of chains now. And I guess</p>
<p>some of those because because of that cartoon, that cartoon, plus it&rsquo;s like a series going after</p>
<p>the social governance part of you know, environmental and pointing out he stated on</p>
<p>his podcast that he wants to kill ESG. So this whole ESG debate, he&rsquo;s trying to further it,</p>
<p>but I guess that Yeah, well, I mean, the the concept of ESG makes a ton of sense. I think</p>
<p>the problem is that it does implement this. Yeah, this version 1.0 implementation was</p>
<p>financialized by people that have no care about ESG at all. And so all it&rsquo;s done is create</p>
<p>complexity and consultants and, you know, studies sense or it doesn&rsquo;t make sense.</p>
<p>No, the words ESG make a lot of they have commas or periods between them,</p>
<p>I guess is the question. That&rsquo;s fine, too. But my point is saying that you want, you know,</p>
<p>diversity, and you want sustainability, and you want better governance, all good,</p>
<p>all of these things are really great ideas. It&rsquo;s just that in this first implementation,</p>
<p>it got financially perverted. And so what you have are folks that are, you know, probably not</p>
<p>the best position or should not really have an opinion about ESG opining about things that they</p>
<p>never were given the authority to opine on. And then as a result, what it&rsquo;s really created is a</p>
<p>cottage industry of consultants that can basically make, you know, hundreds of millions of dollars</p>
<p>writing all of these reports. And I think that that&rsquo;s why this implementation doesn&rsquo;t work. So</p>
<p>ESG today is broken. And I think it&rsquo;s largely meaningless. The concept of what people want is</p>
<p>is a very good idea. We just need a better way to implement. I agree with that. You can&rsquo;t connect</p>
<p>these things. We&rsquo;re going to put social and governance with environment. It&rsquo;s all that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to do is hold back the environment, right? sacks, sacks, we&rsquo;re having all of fed beef tonight.</p>
<p>Oh, this is great. You need to try it. I&rsquo;ll see what I can do.</p>
<p>No, you have to do it. You have to do it sucks. Okay. Once you have to say sacks,</p>
<p>commit no bullshit anymore. So you cannot imagine what does a beef look like that has been only fed</p>
<p>green olives, pitted green olives that I can tell you I can tell you how it looks delicious.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a green. It&rsquo;s the most delicious steak you&rsquo;ve had in your life. It&rsquo;s the most delicious.</p>
<p>All right, I&rsquo;ll come for that. Okay, it&rsquo;s incredible. Awesome. You&rsquo;re gonna drive me</p>
<p>with your driver. Text me your address. So I know where to get you.</p>
<p>Oh, I love it. Oh, this is gonna be great. Game on. Listen to this lineup. Me. J. Cal.</p>
<p>Friedberg sacks.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s flying it. This thing. This is gonna jump up. This game is gonna</p>
<p>no more flips. The flips are ridiculous. Okay, you know what now now that sacks is coming,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to tell them to break out the early white truffles.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just kidding. You&rsquo;re setting the truffle pigs. Not not just walk to my office. She looked at me</p>
<p>when I said white truffles. She&rsquo;s like for bestie dinner. It&rsquo;s happening everybody.</p>
<p>Oh, it&rsquo;s happening. It&rsquo;s happening. You know, what I saw was Helmut the other day</p>
<p>on one of his heads up matches where he got in that huge fight with that guy. Did you guys see</p>
<p>that? And he called every match you just described every match. He&rsquo;s like some heads up thing.</p>
<p>And the guy had flopped some insane I think it was like quads or something or and Helmut had</p>
<p>like top pair except yeah, yeah. And Helmut folded on this guy. It was incredible to watch the play</p>
<p>like the read from Helmut was unbelievable. He is incredible. He&rsquo;s a friggin phenom that guy.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s pretty great. He&rsquo;s got unbelievable. He&rsquo;s the greatest poker player in the world. He really</p>
<p>he his reads are unbelievable. I think that what percentage of it is obviously he is incredible</p>
<p>player. But there&rsquo;s another piece of this that we all see which is people play into him. They</p>
<p>want to be in a hand with him. They want to bust him. So in those tournaments, what do you think?</p>
<p>No, I think I think what&rsquo;s happening is at the highest level, there&rsquo;s like all these people that</p>
<p>have gone in this one direction. And by the way, this is probably a good, we could talk about chess</p>
<p>in the same way, which is that you have these solvers, right? There&rsquo;s poker solvers. And now</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re there these chess solvers. And the young generation spends all this time training on the</p>
<p>solvers so that they know every permutation of every move and what is what people call game</p>
<p>theory optimal or GTO. The problem with GTO is that you can actually be very exploitative against</p>
<p>somebody that&rsquo;s actually playing perfectly, because the AI is perfected around what is the</p>
<p>rational set of decisions in every spot. And so you can set people up to make a lot of really</p>
<p>bad mistakes. And I think Helmuth understands that. And so because he is one of like this dying</p>
<p>breed of people that plays live, he&rsquo;s able to just be so exploitative. And these folks that are</p>
<p>basically playing from rote memory, right? What is the GTO move in every spot, they end up making a</p>
<p>bunch of mistakes and, and feeding chips into him. And so I think like, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s probably the</p>
<p>same as sort of this Magnus Carlsen, he kind of knew what to expect from people. And the minute</p>
<p>this get deviated into this realm where you were like, how could you make that decision?</p>
<p>Probably because you know, the the computer AI is able to calculate, make a slightly losing move.</p>
<p>Now, three moves later, you&rsquo;re going to actually be ahead. It caught him off guard where he was</p>
<p>basically like, I think this guy&rsquo;s cheating. Really, really crazy. But I think like, if you</p>
<p>if you have a bunch of GTO kids, folks that are a little bit older that have been playing</p>
<p>in a live situation can be hyper exploitative. By the way, this is a good point, generally about</p>
<p>about this gaming is that computation has played and computers have played such</p>
<p>an incredible role, it almost becomes questionable on how much can the human really differentiate</p>
<p>anymore. In these, in these games, and in these systems, you guys watch the chess players on</p>
<p>YouTube, and they&rsquo;ll have solvers live, and they&rsquo;ll be getting live scoring as they kind of</p>
<p>walk through a match or walk by the way, free burn areas. That&rsquo;s the same with poker, you have</p>
<p>these huts, these heads up displays. And a lot of the poker sites have basically given up, they try</p>
<p>to spot the cheating. And you can it could because you have this basically layer that&rsquo;s helping you.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s effectively impossible, because, you know, these things run locally,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re screen scraping locally, and you just have no idea, except when they make moves that</p>
<p>are just so unpredictable from a human and could only come from a from a from a machine.</p>
<p>All games maybe become obsolete, because there is no real way to qualify the performance of</p>
<p>one human against another, when the AI itself or the technology or the computing itself,</p>
<p>you know, overshadows human potential and human capability.</p>
<p>You guys may not know this story. But when I met Demas, the founder of DeepMind,</p>
<p>I got introduced by Teal, like in 2011, or 12. So like a decade ago, and I met him in London,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll never forget this at the we were having breakfast at the con at hotel. And he explained</p>
<p>to me DeepMind in the context of a game because at that time, how they were building the first</p>
<p>versions of the AI was perfecting how to play certain video games. And I can&rsquo;t remember the</p>
<p>name of the video game, but it was one of the famous first person shooter games. And the whole</p>
<p>idea there was like, you know, if you can perfect an AI that basically plays GTO and can win the</p>
<p>game, what you&rsquo;ve effectively solved for is is like a layer of AI that can then solve other</p>
<p>generalized problems. I was blown away. I thought this is the craziest thing I&rsquo;ve ever heard a</p>
<p>decade ago. So it&rsquo;s pretty natural that they&rsquo;ve taken this stuff and adapted it to meet every</p>
<p>game. It&rsquo;s a little sad, though, to know, don&rsquo;t you think? Yeah, I mean, yeah. But I mean, maybe</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a different model of performance for humans that really changes what the gaming is,</p>
<p>right? Well, I don&rsquo;t know what it is. I mean, I think that these games themselves completely,</p>
<p>you know, the intent of a game, which is to measure one&rsquo;s kind of decision making abilities</p>
<p>gets obsoleted, because the software ultimately is a better decision maker than the human.</p>
<p>So the question then is, what is the human going to rise to that creates a new playing field?</p>
<p>And I think there&rsquo;s probably elements of creativity and actually using the software</p>
<p>to become part of the game that opens up a whole new opportunity for what gaming is. I mean,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve been talking a little bit about video games, but you could see artificial constructs</p>
<p>in gaming that arise from the human interacting with the computer and then creating a new sort</p>
<p>of playing field in gaming. Yeah. Saks, what do you think about all this? You&rsquo;re a big chess player.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;ve been following it for the last couple of weeks. It&rsquo;s obviously been the big story in</p>
<p>the chess world. What basically happened is that a couple of weeks ago, Magnus Carlsen lost that</p>
<p>game to Hans, what&rsquo;s his last name? Niemann, I think. Niemann, yeah, exactly. And the next day,</p>
<p>he pulled out of the tournament. This is the Sinkfield Cup. And he&rsquo;s never pulled out of a</p>
<p>tournament before. Everyone was sort of speculating, is he sick or have COVID or something</p>
<p>like that? And then he tweeted out a video from some soccer coach saying, I can&rsquo;t talk about it,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll get in trouble. Yeah. So, clearly he was in a passive-aggressive way of making an accusation.</p>
<p>And then he doubled down a few days ago. He was in another tournament and he had to play Hans,</p>
<p>I keep forgetting the guy&rsquo;s name. Hans Niemann.</p>
<p>Niemann, yeah. He had to play him and he resigned on move two. So, basically,</p>
<p>he doubled down in his accusation. And he won&rsquo;t specifically say</p>
<p>what leads him to believe that this guy is cheating, but he thinks he is.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a young player. He&rsquo;s something like 18. And he&rsquo;s had a pretty meteoric rise in the chess</p>
<p>world. I think his rating has gone up a couple of hundred points over the last two years.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the fastest rise in chess rating that anyone&rsquo;s ever had before. It&rsquo;s been the case that</p>
<p>players have, and young players especially, have risen quickly, but this is a pretty,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the biggest rise that&rsquo;s happened. How is he cheating?</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s the thing. So, the issue is that it&rsquo;s easy to cheat in online chess,</p>
<p>but in over the board, you would either need to have a device or to be</p>
<p>signaled by somebody in the crowd. You&rsquo;d need human assistance or the assistance of a device.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d almost be like a casino or something where they&rsquo;re using the contraption on the guy&rsquo;s leg to</p>
<p>signal information to him. So, nobody really knows how he would have done it. And of course,</p>
<p>he wasn&rsquo;t caught doing it. So, he can never prove that he wasn&rsquo;t. So, there&rsquo;s just a real question</p>
<p>of- But they did make some changes after</p>
<p>Magnus Carlsen resigned. They put the feed on a 15-minute delay. I think at some point,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to have to start wanding people and having them go through a metal detector.</p>
<p>Yeah, they&rsquo;re going to have to toughen up all of the anti-cheating standards.</p>
<p>One of the grandmasters was like, we should play naked in a locker room.</p>
<p>Yeah, there was an online site that basically offered to pay</p>
<p>Neiman a lot of money to play basically naked to prove that he could really do what he&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>doing. The theory on why he&rsquo;s not cheating and the rise is justified is that in theory,</p>
<p>this is the argument, is that he&rsquo;s grown up learning from all these neural nets,</p>
<p>not just chess engines. The first generation of chess engines were like stockfish. They were</p>
<p>computational machines that were programmed by humans with thousands of rules on how to play</p>
<p>chess. Then they could just crunch the lines better than a human could. More recently,</p>
<p>thanks to DeepMind, it&rsquo;s a whole different type of machine. It&rsquo;s basically these neural networks</p>
<p>where all they&rsquo;re programmed with are the rules of chess. Then it plays thousands of games or</p>
<p>millions of games against itself and it learns the best way to play chess. The neural nets play</p>
<p>in a whole different way than stockfish, than the pure engines. The engines display like a human</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s able to calculate really well, whereas the neural nets do things like-</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re sacrifices that a human would never make.</p>
<p>Yeah, they&rsquo;ll make sacrifices just for peace activity. Normally, when a human makes a sacrifice,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll recapture the material within a few moves, whereas DeepMind will sacrifice a pawn.</p>
<p>And just for the positional advantage or for the increase in peace activity, it gets-</p>
<p>Which doesn&rsquo;t show up for many, many moves.</p>
<p>Right, exactly.</p>
<p>And so the ability to model like 12 moves out is really-</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s where I think people thought that Magnus picked up on something because it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>those sorts of moves are rare in the absence of some layer of intervention because typically it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like, and Sax, you know this much better than I, but it&rsquo;s like, the opening and the closings of</p>
<p>all of these chess matches are sort of tightly regulated. There&rsquo;s not a lot of creativity. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>sort of in the mid-game that you have these slight positional advantages and disadvantages. And so</p>
<p>I think it was amplified that one of these positional sacrifices made no sense in the</p>
<p>context of that game unless you had the ability to, you know, think really conclusively about</p>
<p>six, seven moves from now. By the way, it&rsquo;s the same thing in poker. So there&rsquo;s a thing,</p>
<p>if you guys want to download it, it&rsquo;s called, I think it&rsquo;s called Poker Snowy.</p>
<p>That was like the first layer of a pretty basic AI, but it&rsquo;s gotten better and better. And really</p>
<p>what it allows you to do is in every situational spot, whether it&rsquo;s heads up all the way to a</p>
<p>six-handed ring game, you can really understand, you know, what to do. Now, poker is meaningfully</p>
<p>more complicated than chess, as it turns out, because again, you have, you&rsquo;re not playing</p>
<p>against one player, you&rsquo;re playing against some umpteen number of players. You know,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t know when each of them is going to step into a pot or step out of a pot.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s all of those elements. So it&rsquo;s a little bit more complicated to build a true</p>
<p>kind of like neural net around it. But even still, you can kind of get a sense of,</p>
<p>of what you should be doing in different spots. And what you see is that</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s literally like trillions of actions. And so it really is impossible for a human being</p>
<p>to really memorize in every single situation, what the true, you know,</p>
<p>probability probabilistically weighted GTO optimized move is going to be. And and so this</p>
<p>is why I think a lot of people, I guess, led by Magnus was saying, How could you have known this</p>
<p>unless you were aided by something? It&rsquo;s pretty clear that this guy cheated. It&rsquo;s pretty it&rsquo;s I</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s it was it was profound is that mastery of the game may not be achievable by a human,</p>
<p>but mastery of any one of these games may actually be achievable by neural nets. And I think that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s really frustrating to Magnus and to other top tier players in the world that are the best</p>
<p>humans at a particular game is they&rsquo;re now realizing, you know, that they really aren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>the true masters that the true masters are the neural nets. And more than just the guy cheating,</p>
<p>which may feel like bad sportsmanship or whatever, fundamentally, one&rsquo;s ego being built entirely on</p>
<p>one&rsquo;s mastery of the game and being the best at the game is fundamentally challenged because a</p>
<p>computer is better at the game than you. It&rsquo;s a really profound moment. That shouldn&rsquo;t be I think</p>
<p>that that ship sailed a long time ago. Yeah, I mean, I know the chess world very well. Yeah,</p>
<p>well, no, it was so it was way back when remember when Kasparov played deep blue,</p>
<p>which is the IBM? Yeah, that was the first which wasn&rsquo;t even a sophisticated neural net. That was</p>
<p>just a almost realistically modeled. Yeah, it was deterministically modeled system. It was like</p>
<p>Stockfish. It was just a number cruncher. And that was when computer intelligence and chess</p>
<p>tip to be able to beat the world champion. Since then, there&rsquo;s no looking back. I think every</p>
<p>human who plays in the chess world understands that computers are better and there&rsquo;s no way</p>
<p>for a human to be better than a computer. So it&rsquo;s certainly not a neural net. I mean,</p>
<p>Magnus certainly knows that. I don&rsquo;t think anyone&rsquo;s bothered by that. I think that everyone</p>
<p>understands that humans play in a certain way and their goal is to be the best human.</p>
<p>I think the concern is just obviously if a human it gets aided during a game by computers. But</p>
<p>the way that chess works now, the preparation is all about working with computers. These top</p>
<p>players spend huge amounts of time researching openings and looking for novelties in openings,</p>
<p>using computers to help them do their research. So, you know, working with computers has now</p>
<p>become an integral part of the game. It&rsquo;s kind of like, you know, in many sports where the technology</p>
<p>has enabled the athlete to get better, you know, and, and it&rsquo;s really technology becomes the key</p>
<p>vector of competition. This actually happened in the NBA, this happened in the NBA, where there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>special technology for three point shooting and your form, etc. And the Knicks actually,</p>
<p>and a couple of other teams implemented it a couple of years ago, and you saw the entire team</p>
<p>became better at three point shooting. So people who were, you know, 200%, 300%, you know, moved</p>
<p>up 10 20% each. But this kid is clearly cheating, because he&rsquo;s cheated in the past. And people who</p>
<p>cheat in the past cheat in the future is my basic belief. So this guy, Neiman, publicly admitted</p>
<p>that he used electronic devices to cheat when he was just a kid on online games when he was 12 to</p>
<p>16 years old. So the question is, like, No, but Jason, it&rsquo;s worse than that, I think, because</p>
<p>then chess.com came out and said, actually, the cheating was more rampant than just those two</p>
<p>incidents. Their algorithm determined it. Yeah, yeah. So why are people playing with him?</p>
<p>Well, because he said, yeah, he said that was those games were not for money. And he was just</p>
<p>gonna build his rating fast. And he was a poker guy. So if you&rsquo;re a poker guy, and you&rsquo;ve cheated</p>
<p>before, you never play with those players. Again, they&rsquo;re cheaters. It&rsquo;s obviously an issue.</p>
<p>Well, the issue here is that this was an over the board tournament, where the one that Magnus</p>
<p>pulled out of in order to protest. So the question is, how could he have been cheating?</p>
<p>Right? Now, I think what what adds to the complexity of it is that you have to remember</p>
<p>that when you&rsquo;re dealing with a player, look, if it was us playing Magnus, we need to cheat on</p>
<p>every single move. But if you&rsquo;re a 26 or 2700 player, and you know, Magnus is a 2860 or something</p>
<p>higher, the rating, the better in chess called the Elo. But in any event, if you&rsquo;re like a 262700</p>
<p>player, like Neiman, you only need help with a few moves in the game. In other words, if you could</p>
<p>get a tip at a critical moment of the game, that might be all you need to put you over the top,</p>
<p>you wouldn&rsquo;t need to, in other words, to beat Magnus, you wouldn&rsquo;t need to cheat on every move,</p>
<p>you could just if you just cheat on two or three moves at the right time, that could put you over</p>
<p>the top. So something could vibrate on your leg, four times, and then two times over to tell you</p>
<p>which piece to move. That&rsquo;s what they were saying, Jake, like he had like a vibrator in his like,</p>
<p>where was the vibrator? In his shoe. There was a meme that became like a whole thing where it was</p>
<p>like he had something in his butt or something. Vibrating anal beats. An anal chess computer is</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re saying? Okay, no, look, that&rsquo;s not real. Somebody speculated on Reddit. Somebody</p>
<p>did a Reddit post saying that he was being communicated with through vibrating anal beads,</p>
<p>and then that went viral. Elon tweeted it, although I think he deleted it. Look,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s absurd. But the point is, there is a question of how would he have done it if he did it?</p>
<p>Yeah, there have been cases before though of people getting caught. Yeah, people getting caught</p>
<p>going to the bathroom and then you know, checking their phone. There&rsquo;s a there&rsquo;s a grand Bulgarian</p>
<p>grandmaster, he got caught in the bathroom checking his phone and Oh, God, metal detectors</p>
<p>on the way in and they have RF detectors in the room, right? So they look for any sort of</p>
<p>communication. I didn&rsquo;t remember that going into this event, you just can&rsquo;t have nobody watching.</p>
<p>No, they did it after a half hour delay. The St. Phil Cup added a 15 minute delay after</p>
<p>these accusations. So yeah, I think there&rsquo;s gonna be there&rsquo;s gonna be more precautions,</p>
<p>basically. But we still haven&rsquo;t heard from Magnus what made him think that there was foul play here</p>
<p>in this particular game. And he&rsquo;s been very reluctant to he won&rsquo;t say anything. It&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>sort of passive aggressive. Now the flip side of it is that Magnus Carlsen has been the number one</p>
<p>player in chess for over a decade. And he&rsquo;s a very classy player. I mean, I don&rsquo;t you know,</p>
<p>everyone&rsquo;s never heard a word said about him that you know, was now he can be cocky. He can</p>
<p>definitely be cocky, but he&rsquo;s a very classy player. So I just don&rsquo;t see him doing something</p>
<p>like this lightly. So that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s so dramatic to understand about it. Dramatic is Yeah, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>really hard to understand how Neiman could have cheated. But also Magnus doesn&rsquo;t seem like the</p>
<p>kind of player to just make a wild impulsive allegation. So this is why the chess world has</p>
<p>been really roiled by this. Is there like a any kind of equivalent of like PD scandal here like</p>
<p>people taking Adderall or for vigil or any other kind of nootropics to get an edge?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a good documentary. I think it was on vice on how a lot of the top chess players</p>
<p>actually get ready for matches. And they&rsquo;re incredibly diligent about their sleep, their</p>
<p>workout routine, alcohol, they do take supplements. I forgot who made the documentary, but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>actually incredibly intense how physical these people are. Well, like one game of classical</p>
<p>chess can burn like over 2000 calories or something like that, like the amount of</p>
<p>calories that get burned just by using your brain so intensely.</p>
<p>Adderall is rampant in the poker community, especially in tournaments. So when you play the</p>
<p>higher tournaments, and I played them, and I just kind of step in and, and it&rsquo;s, I felt very</p>
<p>underpowered relative to the to the kids I was playing with, because they were all on Adderall.</p>
<p>Well, there are 12 hours. Well, it&rsquo;s 10 hour sessions over 12 hours. It&rsquo;s exhausting. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>really, really physically exhausting to play. That&rsquo;s why I stopped playing tournaments about</p>
<p>a decade ago, I just couldn&rsquo;t sit there for that long. It can&rsquo;t justify the time suck of it, too.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s just so it&rsquo;s just so physically and emotionally demanding to be able to play that</p>
<p>well and make no mistakes over 10 hours. And so you know, the only solution that all these kids</p>
<p>would turn to was, was Adderall. And I was like, this is not worth it for me. So I stopped, I</p>
<p>stopped playing in tournaments, and which was too bad, because I thought like, I could have a real</p>
<p>chance of actually doing reasonably well in some of these things. And I just gave up. By the way,</p>
<p>the other thing I wanted to mention is there&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s been like cheating and all these other</p>
<p>kinds of sports and always gets exposed, like whether it&rsquo;s, you know, the Tour de France,</p>
<p>it turned out that everybody was using PEDs, or, you know, the Russian Olympic team, everybody was</p>
<p>using PEDs, New England Patriots stealing signals. Yeah. All right, listen, let&rsquo;s just talk about the</p>
<p>Iran protest for a moment. Iran has shut off internet access, internet access in parts of</p>
<p>Tehran, and blocked access to Instagram and WhatsApp to try to stop these protests. The</p>
<p>protests started after the death of a 22 year old Kurdish woman. While in police custody,</p>
<p>Masa Amini was detained on September 16, for allegedly wearing hijab headscarf in an improper</p>
<p>way. She later died in police custody. And activists are saying she suffered a fatal blow to her head.</p>
<p>And now you have 15 cities with very large crowds, women are burning their hijabs, and it seems to be</p>
<p>escalating at a pretty fast pace. Iranian authorities are denying that they had any</p>
<p>part in her death. Thoughts on this? It&rsquo;s horrible. Yeah. I wish them well. If you look at the</p>
<p>demographics of Iran, it&rsquo;s pretty amazing how many young people there are here. This feels like a</p>
<p>country that could turn over. That&rsquo;d be great. And you want to know why it has a chance of working</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re not the ones behind it. I mean, absolutely. Yeah, we cannot. Yeah. Run the</p>
<p>revolution. The revolution has to be done. But to the women and young people of Iran protesting,</p>
<p>you have our support. And we&rsquo;re rooting for you. And don&rsquo;t let the bastards grind you down.</p>
<p>All right, everybody. For</p>
<p>David got her names. Did you forget her names? No, I&rsquo;m just I was gonna try to come up with a</p>
<p>new name for Rageberg. Like Friedberg. David Plainview. Rageburger rage for Rageburger</p>
<p>Plainview. The David the Dove, and the host with the most Chamath Palihapitiya. I&rsquo;m the world&rsquo;s</p>
<p>greatest moderator. I&rsquo;m so excited to see all three of you. Honestly, because sacks don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>flake. I love you guys. I really want to play sacks. Don&rsquo;t fall. We got it. We should roll</p>
<p>down together. Let&rsquo;s roll baby. Big game. All right. We&rsquo;ll tell you the results in the game.</p>
<p>Love you besties.</p>
<p>Oh, man. We should all just get a room and just have one big huge orgy because they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>all just useless. It&rsquo;s like this like sexual tension that they just need to release somehow.</p>
