<p>all right well done I&rsquo;ll I&rsquo;ll step in</p>
<p>here and we&rsquo;ve got some very exciting uh</p>
<p>bright individuals in The Green Room</p>
<p>which we&rsquo;ll be getting to throughout the</p>
<p>hour and in fact one of them will keeps</p>
<p>popping off and on so I&rsquo;m going to try</p>
<p>to get him before his entire system</p>
<p>implodes and will if you would unmute</p>
<p>yourself I&rsquo;m going to put you on with Dr</p>
<p>Berg there you go with your one question</p>
<p>30 seconds please</p>
<p>all right thank you very much good to</p>
<p>see you Dr Berg I&rsquo;ve really enjoyed your</p>
<p>content thank you</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a t related question it&rsquo;s kind of</p>
<p>twofold you mentioned one time that if</p>
<p>you buy the pro you know the bottle</p>
<p>lemon juice that has past your eyes the</p>
<p>vitamin C has kind of been destroyed so</p>
<p>if I squeeze my own</p>
<p>organic lemon into really hot steeping</p>
<p>tea does that also destroy it and the</p>
<p>second part of that is if I mix</p>
<p>different kinds of tea like Mulan leaf</p>
<p>and lemon balm</p>
<p>uh does the do the effects get mixed up</p>
<p>or or altered in any way or is it okay</p>
<p>to mix different teas like that and</p>
<p>still get the intended desired effect</p>
<p>good question when you&rsquo;re um taking um</p>
<p>vitamin C for example</p>
<p>um you have a couple things that degrade</p>
<p>it really fast you have uh exposure to</p>
<p>oxygen that&rsquo;s why a lemon is so filled</p>
<p>with antioxidants to protect it and then</p>
<p>you also have heat but when they</p>
<p>pasteurize it they usually have high</p>
<p>Heats much higher hotter than you would</p>
<p>put with your water and then longer so</p>
<p>they would cook it for a longer period</p>
<p>of time so I think putting it in the</p>
<p>some hot water is not going to be a</p>
<p>problem you&rsquo;re not going to lose that</p>
<p>much and when you blend different teas</p>
<p>together especially if it&rsquo;s within you</p>
<p>know different herbs you&rsquo;re not going to</p>
<p>negate any of the effects at all I think</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll work synergistically and help</p>
<p>you</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>but um</p>
<p>also realize that a lot of the</p>
<p>phytonutrient benefits from tea</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>can survive some of this heat so that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s another interesting thing um</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>like I even thought omega-3 fatty acids</p>
<p>were destroyed with asterization</p>
<p>and so I told people that and I&rsquo;ve knit</p>
<p>a video on it and then so I said that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>why I said you know when you have your</p>
<p>sardines for example you&rsquo;re probably not</p>
<p>going to get very much omega-3 and then</p>
<p>I thought I started thinking about like</p>
<p>I I don&rsquo;t know that for a fact I sent it</p>
<p>to the lab and I found out sure enough</p>
<p>there were major high levels of Omega-3</p>
<p>in sardines and and fish which I just</p>
<p>blew me away so apparently certain</p>
<p>things can survive but vitamin C is</p>
<p>along the list the only time you would</p>
<p>see vitamin C in like canned orange</p>
<p>juice whatever or even lemon juices when</p>
<p>they add it in there as a preservative</p>
<p>usually synthetically</p>
<p>well thank you sir hey thanks appreciate</p>
<p>it thanks so much uh will and you didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>pop off so now you can stay on there and</p>
<p>watch the rest of the show and have a</p>
<p>blast and by the way once again the most</p>
<p>one of the most refreshing things about</p>
<p>Dr Berg is he is sort of ego free when</p>
<p>it comes to facts he&rsquo;s very willing to</p>
<p>change his mind or discover new things</p>
<p>and his interest is in the truth and</p>
<p>what helps people and you know his uh</p>
<p>you know</p>
<p>um having to sort of re</p>
<p>test his results is not against him at</p>
<p>all so I think it&rsquo;s just terrific thank</p>
<p>you DOC for your Clarity on and</p>
<p>transparency and all that stuff why</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t we kick it off with the first uh</p>
<p>quiz question today and Doc there it is</p>
<p>all right good so let&rsquo;s see if I could</p>
<p>find okay here it is right here all</p>
<p>right why does sulforaphane</p>
<p>reduce symptoms of autism</p>
<p>sulforaphane is that chemical in</p>
<p>broccoli Sprouts but it&rsquo;s another</p>
<p>cruciferous vegetables as well why would</p>
<p>that I mean that&rsquo;s pretty wild that a</p>
<p>chemical on a plant can actually reduce</p>
<p>um autism uh symptoms so</p>
<p>um what do you think the mechanism is</p>
<p>just go ahead and type it and then let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>see if you&rsquo;re correct all right I have</p>
<p>every faith in the audience there the</p>
<p>fastest answers in the on the globe okay</p>
<p>speaking of social media let&rsquo;s go there</p>
<p>and this one is from Zappa on YouTube</p>
<p>what is your opinion on nootropics and</p>
<p>boy that word sure does come up a lot</p>
<p>lately</p>
<p>these are certain compounds that</p>
<p>help um</p>
<p>Focus memory</p>
<p>um your brain</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re not they&rsquo;re not like</p>
<p>necessarily just stimulants there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>certain uh</p>
<p>camp out chemicals that you can use to</p>
<p>to do that now I experimented with this</p>
<p>a while ago and</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t see much benefit other people</p>
<p>say they it really helps them focused um</p>
<p>my my question is and my thought is on</p>
<p>that before you would go in that</p>
<p>direction I would make sure first that</p>
<p>your diet is squared away because um</p>
<p>you know so many people are trying to</p>
<p>fix like memory or focus on top of a</p>
<p>crappy diet or even like when you run</p>
<p>your brain on ketones</p>
<p>um and you do intermittent fasting you&rsquo;d</p>
<p>be shocked to find how your cognitive</p>
<p>function improves as well as your mood</p>
<p>and you wouldn&rsquo;t necessarily even need</p>
<p>to take a supplement so I always like</p>
<p>the supplements after you&rsquo;ve tried the</p>
<p>basic eating plan</p>
<p>um and so</p>
<p>you know like why why would it be um why</p>
<p>would you have a problem with focus in</p>
<p>the first place or memory in the first</p>
<p>place</p>
<p>um that&rsquo;s what I would address</p>
<p>but nootropics are definitely uh very</p>
<p>popular and</p>
<p>a lot of people are experimenting with</p>
<p>them and that it&rsquo;s not it&rsquo;s just a wild</p>
<p>wild west right now there&rsquo;s like people</p>
<p>I will try this and try this because</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s not there&rsquo;s so many</p>
<p>different variables involved and um it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>something you would just have to</p>
<p>experiment with on yourself to see if</p>
<p>that could help you</p>
<p>okay very good still on YouTube uh</p>
<p>bratinga wants to know do blue blockers</p>
<p>for devices actually work so maybe some</p>
<p>Red film I think they do they do and</p>
<p>they do protect you against that blue</p>
<p>light which is damaging uh on certain</p>
<p>parts of the eye</p>
<p>um also realize that um when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>using your cell phone</p>
<p>um you&rsquo;re getting a lot of blue light or</p>
<p>your laptops you&rsquo;re just getting a lot</p>
<p>of blue light</p>
<p>um and that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s not good for your</p>
<p>eyes</p>
<p>um it tires the eyes</p>
<p>um but when you get the full spectrum of</p>
<p>sun for example that you&rsquo;re exposing to</p>
<p>the eyes</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>also realize that um the ultraviolet I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>sorry the in um infrared</p>
<p>that comes from the sun which by the way</p>
<p>is a little bit more than 50 percent of</p>
<p>that race well town to help to cancel</p>
<p>out or reduce the effects of these other</p>
<p>harmful rays</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s in a full spectrum</p>
<p>so I mean blue blockers are are good but</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>if we&rsquo;re talking about damage to the</p>
<p>retina or damage to the lens or the back</p>
<p>part of the retina called the macula</p>
<p>um we&rsquo;ll be talking about more of that</p>
<p>after the first after we actually answer</p>
<p>the first or actually second question I</p>
<p>think it is but um I will mention more</p>
<p>about that later</p>
<p>okay that&rsquo;s very good and here&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>question let&rsquo;s see and thank you Roy for</p>
<p>this because it sounds interesting</p>
<p>please share your thoughts on complex</p>
<p>carbs versus simple carbs what&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>difference there</p>
<p>oh it&rsquo;s too complex of a question no</p>
<p>um all right forget it you&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about</p>
<p>you know vegetables right but but people</p>
<p>are gonna also throw in their grains</p>
<p>starches things like that</p>
<p>um simple simple carbs would be like</p>
<p>able sugar refined sugars that type of</p>
<p>thing</p>
<p>um so that&rsquo;s kind of what they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>talking about and that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s a that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a good</p>
<p>good idea to eat complex carbohydrates</p>
<p>but I would only eat them in the form of</p>
<p>vegetables and maybe a small amount of</p>
<p>berries but vegetables have the um</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the complex carbohydrates but</p>
<p>sometimes they mesh in there well you</p>
<p>can do the you know fruits brains and</p>
<p>vegetables yeah they have to throw that</p>
<p>grain in there which is not very good</p>
<p>all right watch out for that folks uh</p>
<p>and we watched out for questions and the</p>
<p>audience responded so the first quiz</p>
<p>question for the day ask the audience</p>
<p>why do sulfurophane reduce symptoms of</p>
<p>autism and they have an opinion 65 of</p>
<p>the respondents say sulforaphane reduces</p>
<p>inflammation in the brain 35 say it</p>
<p>reduces oxidative stress</p>
<p>everyone&rsquo;s correct we&rsquo;ve got 100</p>
<p>impression on that you&rsquo;re right when you</p>
<p>have autism</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t get into like what&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>triggering autism but I will say this</p>
<p>um we have a lot of oxidative stress now</p>
<p>what the heck is oxidative stress well</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an imbalance of our own body&rsquo;s uh</p>
<p>antioxidants with the oxidation that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>coming in the brain and then you have</p>
<p>neural inflammation you have brain</p>
<p>inflammation and it just so happens that</p>
<p>there is a certain protein in the body</p>
<p>which is the master master regulator of</p>
<p>all of your</p>
<p>antioxidants that the body produces like</p>
<p>glutathione things like that</p>
<p>and uh it&rsquo;s Nrf2 this little protein and</p>
<p>uh it just so happens the sulforaphane</p>
<p>is a very unique molecule in that it can</p>
<p>turn up that</p>
<p>protein and make it work much higher</p>
<p>than normally</p>
<p>and so now we&rsquo;re going to get all these</p>
<p>antioxidants coming in there to the</p>
<p>rescue we&rsquo;re going to get</p>
<p>anti-inflammatory anti-inflammatory</p>
<p>effects from The sulfur of Fame</p>
<p>the sulfur sulforaphane is interesting</p>
<p>to me because it can kill H pylori which</p>
<p>is behind ulcers it can</p>
<p>um well I guess this is going to be</p>
<p>related to some other questions so I</p>
<p>think I&rsquo;ll stop there but the</p>
<p>fascinating molecule and I&rsquo;m going to be</p>
<p>doing a video on all the things that can</p>
<p>turn up that protein and all the</p>
<p>conditions that it can help so it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>something you want to stay tuned for</p>
<p>okay very good let&rsquo;s see Mary Moore from</p>
<p>YouTube what&rsquo;s the best way to reduce</p>
<p>elevated potassium levels</p>
<p>well the first question is are you</p>
<p>measuring this in your blood or the</p>
<p>inside the cell because like 98 of all</p>
<p>the potassium is intracellular</p>
<p>intracellular potassium so I highly</p>
<p>doubt that you&rsquo;re measuring it there</p>
<p>there is many situations where you have</p>
<p>too much potassium on the in the blood</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s very deficient inside the cell</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s and that usually could occur</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re eating a lot of carbs so</p>
<p>carbohydrates</p>
<p>tend to create a shift in this potassium</p>
<p>um but if you have too much potassium</p>
<p>truly too much potassium</p>
<p>then um you which is</p>
<p>very rare</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>called hyperkalemia then you would need</p>
<p>to take more sodium to balance it out</p>
<p>and the body has a lot of different</p>
<p>mechanisms to get rid of excess</p>
<p>potassium by the way</p>
<p>and a really good test for you to do if</p>
<p>you think you have too much is to find a</p>
<p>test I think you can do a home test</p>
<p>where you measure the intracellular</p>
<p>potassium and you may be shocked to find</p>
<p>out that that&rsquo;s very low so you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>always go by the blood</p>
<p>all right very good Jay let&rsquo;s see no</p>
<p>Rosa from YouTube water fast versus a</p>
<p>dry fast which is better in your opinion</p>
<p>well she&rsquo;s already passed away from</p>
<p>dehydration no I&rsquo;m kidding which is</p>
<p>better</p>
<p>well dry fasting where you&rsquo;re not having</p>
<p>any water and you&rsquo;re fasting is</p>
<p>extremely powerful potent it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>better than water fasting but of course</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a limitation of time so if you</p>
<p>do a dry fast for two weeks that might</p>
<p>be a problem</p>
<p>um in fact I don&rsquo;t think you can live</p>
<p>that long without water but there has</p>
<p>been someone who um</p>
<p>they were in a jail cell I think if I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>not mistaken they lasted 13 days without</p>
<p>water but they actually did consume the</p>
<p>condensation on the walls which is not a</p>
<p>lot of water but that was a little bit a</p>
<p>little bit of water but</p>
<p>um dry fasts are are they just add more</p>
<p>stress to the body and I think it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>good to do short term but again you got</p>
<p>to work into this so you got to be</p>
<p>fairly healthy to do that because some</p>
<p>people</p>
<p>are so low on electrolytes and so</p>
<p>dehydrated that and they start doing</p>
<p>these prolonged fasting right off the</p>
<p>bat or a dry fast and then they end up</p>
<p>you know having</p>
<p>they might get they might faint or have</p>
<p>a problem with that so I would um</p>
<p>go into this</p>
<p>gingerly and gradually if I were you</p>
<p>okay very good Ingrid from YouTube here</p>
<p>we go what are your thoughts about carb</p>
<p>cycling to establish a metabolic reset</p>
<p>I love it I love it I don&rsquo;t know whoever</p>
<p>invented that theory or that concept</p>
<p>that you have to recycle your carbs</p>
<p>for for metabolism</p>
<p>it just is illogical it doesn&rsquo;t make</p>
<p>sense</p>
<p>um we&rsquo;ve already been recycling our</p>
<p>carbs</p>
<p>um for on this diet that so many people</p>
<p>like they binge in carbs and they get</p>
<p>off carbs that&rsquo;s recycling right there</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>um adding more carbs to recycling to</p>
<p>help reset something</p>
<p>from my viewpoint is total rubbish it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like res you don&rsquo;t need to reset your</p>
<p>metabolism with carbs right so I mean it</p>
<p>just it&rsquo;s illogical yeah so take two</p>
<p>cups of sugar and then call us in the</p>
<p>morning let us know how you feel after</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve recycled all that okay let&rsquo;s see</p>
<p>why don&rsquo;t we launch another question Doc</p>
<p>and here it is</p>
<p>okay good why now um the next question</p>
<p>would be why would selenium help reduce</p>
<p>symptoms of HIV and AIDS wow that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>big one okay and while you&rsquo;re all</p>
<p>thinking about that why don&rsquo;t we go back</p>
<p>to the green room and this time we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to bring on uh Adrienne Diaz and</p>
<p>uh she is I forgot to ask her where</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s from but she&rsquo;s indeed wherever she</p>
<p>is and you&rsquo;re on the air Adrian go with</p>
<p>you one question please dear in 30</p>
<p>seconds</p>
<p>moved um my right kidney removed</p>
<p>um due to renal cell carcinoma</p>
<p>um and I need to lose weight because I</p>
<p>have a kidney stone in my other kidney</p>
<p>um before I can get that removed</p>
<p>um so</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hard for me to exercise because</p>
<p>also my left knee is hurting so I have</p>
<p>like all these like issues I guess I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>just getting old but</p>
<p>um I&rsquo;m on Metformin and I saw your</p>
<p>iodine videos and I am low on iodine</p>
<p>um because it disappeared right away but</p>
<p>I have a craving for sweets and sodas</p>
<p>and it doesn&rsquo;t seem like the metformin</p>
<p>is working so I&rsquo;m wondering is there</p>
<p>something that I can take</p>
<p>um to eat to like curb the sweets and</p>
<p>Cravings</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>so that way I can like lose weight and</p>
<p>you know be healthier</p>
<p>sure</p>
<p>are you are you on Metformin because</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re a diabetic</p>
<p>no</p>
<p>um it&rsquo;s because I had all these other</p>
<p>issues and she was like well I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>um you know you need medicine for your</p>
<p>arthritis or this she&rsquo;s like I think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s because you&rsquo;re obese and you need</p>
<p>to get</p>
<p>your weight down and then your knee</p>
<p>would feel better and you know you would</p>
<p>just feel better overall if you lost</p>
<p>weight so that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m on the</p>
<p>metformin okay the metformin um</p>
<p>targets insulin resistance which</p>
<p>is behind a lot of diabetic issues but</p>
<p>it also um</p>
<p>eye insulin puts you at risk for kidney</p>
<p>stones and um</p>
<p>gallbladder problems and weight cane and</p>
<p>all these other things so</p>
<p>um the first thing that I would do as a</p>
<p>really good idea would be to go to my um</p>
<p>website</p>
<p>and just click videos and it has the</p>
<p>first video there start watching One the</p>
<p>first video the second third and start</p>
<p>applying the basics of the ketogenic</p>
<p>diet with intermittent fasting together</p>
<p>as one that&rsquo;s gonna create a really cool</p>
<p>effect for your weight loss you&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to start losing weight and with the way</p>
<p>that you know that it&rsquo;s working even</p>
<p>before you lose a pound is that your</p>
<p>hunger will go away and your Cravings</p>
<p>will go away making it easier to to do</p>
<p>this longer terms so then then you then</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll lose weight and you&rsquo;ll feel</p>
<p>better</p>
<p>and this is like creating a better</p>
<p>effect than metformin but without the</p>
<p>side effects and if you wanted to speed</p>
<p>it up there&rsquo;s another</p>
<p>um there&rsquo;s an herb that has been</p>
<p>compared to metformin but without the</p>
<p>side effects</p>
<p>because there is some major side effects</p>
<p>with metformin and that would be</p>
<p>berberine berberine is a good good one</p>
<p>to take as you&rsquo;re doing keto in</p>
<p>intermittent fasting</p>
<p>I would also take a sea cow sea kelp has</p>
<p>the iodine in it it&rsquo;s a good source you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have to take a lot just take a</p>
<p>little bit of sea kelp and a tablet and</p>
<p>then what will happen that will even</p>
<p>help your thyroid and speed up your</p>
<p>metabolism</p>
<p>I have a lot of videos on kidney stones</p>
<p>and so make sure that you&rsquo;re it</p>
<p>immediately you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re drinking at</p>
<p>least</p>
<p>2.5 liters of fluid a day and that will</p>
<p>actually keep it from getting worse uh</p>
<p>have some lemon in your water</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>and even a little apple cider vinegar</p>
<p>like a tablespoon because that&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>that&rsquo;ll be good for your kidney stone as</p>
<p>you do the ketogenic diet though</p>
<p>very important to uh avoid certain foods</p>
<p>that good worsen the kidney stone like</p>
<p>spinach</p>
<p>almonds and almond flour</p>
<p>chocolate Okay because those are high in</p>
<p>a certain thing that makes kidney stones</p>
<p>not not that you ever eat those and you</p>
<p>would ever even consider eating them but</p>
<p>you probably know neighbors and friends</p>
<p>that might eat those things but um</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s my suggestion I think that would</p>
<p>be successful</p>
<p>okay thank you so much you&rsquo;re welcome</p>
<p>okay thank you very much Adrian and you</p>
<p>got Adrian you&rsquo;ve got a lot of stuff</p>
<p>going on there and we wish you the best</p>
<p>and hope to hear back uh some success</p>
<p>stories uh from you in the future as you</p>
<p>work against all that so appreciate it</p>
<p>now let&rsquo;s see we got a shout out a</p>
<p>little truncated today but I bet it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to grow because more people are</p>
<p>going to check in so so far around the</p>

<p>devil but we&rsquo;re going to do a few things</p>
<p>first Richard but we&rsquo;ll have you up next</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s see So speaking of next we</p>
<p>have some answers back on quiz question</p>
<p>number two again an example of just how</p>
<p>astute our audience is and how quickly</p>
<p>they answer it so the question asks why</p>
<p>would selenium help reduce symptoms from</p>
<p>HIV and AIDS which is a great thing and</p>
<p>um a hundred percent of respondents say</p>
<p>solemnia selenium is an antioxidant and</p>
<p>an immune system booster for the body</p>
<p>okay so that&rsquo;s absolutely true but</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a there&rsquo;s a very interesting</p>
<p>reason why</p>
<p>selenium is used as a protocol</p>
<p>um a natural protocol that um with with</p>
<p>about three more amino acids</p>
<p>um do you know what&rsquo;s interesting about</p>
<p>HIV it&rsquo;s a this virus that really uh has</p>
<p>the potential to wipe out</p>
<p>um the key player in your immune system</p>
<p>called the T helper cell and so that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what it does it takes out the</p>
<p>quarterback and now without a</p>
<p>quarterback you can&rsquo;t you can&rsquo;t win and</p>
<p>so here you are with the immune system</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t work and you&rsquo;re very</p>
<p>vulnerable to getting infections all</p>
<p>over the place in tumors and cancer and</p>
<p>Etc</p>
<p>self</p>
<p>um what&rsquo;s unique about this virus is</p>
<p>that it has the ability</p>
<p>to strategically make glutathione which</p>
<p>is a really key antioxidant</p>
<p>because in this virus like you have a</p>
<p>lot of oxidation a lot of oxidative</p>
<p>stress inflammation but</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>the that t or help help our cell needs</p>
<p>glutathione to get it to work</p>
<p>so without glutathione because think</p>
<p>about this this virus is making all this</p>
<p>glutathione for its own accord and</p>
<p>depleting you of the raw materials to</p>
<p>make it which is selenium so it</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very</p>
<p>um nasty because it sucks up your</p>
<p>selenium keeping you high and dry with</p>
<p>no reserves because it&rsquo;s making this</p>
<p>glutathione hogging it all and then you</p>
<p>end up without enough glutathione</p>
<p>because you don&rsquo;t have the selenium to</p>
<p>make it and then you can&rsquo;t make that t</p>
<p>helper cell and that&rsquo;s when things go</p>
<p>downhill</p>
<p>so a really uh brilliant um</p>
<p>Professor came up with a protocol and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to be talking about it in a</p>
<p>video he wrote a book on it and I think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like wow what a simple way to</p>
<p>strengthen your immune system and</p>
<p>apparently there&rsquo;s a couple other</p>
<p>viruses</p>
<p>that do the same thing like uh the one</p>
<p>for Hepatitis B and hepatitis C which</p>
<p>selenium would also be a good remedy for</p>
<p>but I think this is just a fascinating</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>sneaky little thing that these viruses</p>
<p>do and it&rsquo;s important if you know the</p>
<p>mechanism then you can you can even</p>
<p>counter it further with natural things</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s my long answer very good and if</p>
<p>you want more answers of course you can</p>
<p>go to Dr Berg&rsquo;s wonderful online app uh</p>
<p>and you can get that on your iOS iPhone</p>
<p>device or Android so you&rsquo;ll have a world</p>
<p>of answers in your pockets make sure you</p>
<p>download that today and let&rsquo;s go over to</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>to Facebook weren&rsquo;t I I miss my question</p>
<p>from Facebook</p>
<p>oh the heck let&rsquo;s go back shout out for</p>
<p>some more people I knew that was coming</p>
<p>a shout out to our viewers in Indonesia</p>
<p>Germany Bangladesh Botswana Sierra Leone</p>
<p>Bulgaria Belize Scotland the Philippines</p>
<p>Venezuela Pakistan Romania Trinidad and</p>
<p>Tobago and Portugal can you imagine most</p>
<p>shows even the big ones would die for</p>
<p>three or four countries around the world</p>
<p>and we just darn near got a pin and uh</p>
<p>in every map around the country so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s great thanks everybody so much</p>
<p>for tuning in uh let&rsquo;s see Sarah from</p>
<p>YouTube what are the best supplements to</p>
<p>take to treat PCOS</p>
<p>um inositol is a good one it&rsquo;s called I</p>
<p>would take a myo inositol that&rsquo;s a good</p>
<p>one and berberine those two in addition</p>
<p>to getting on keto because we have a</p>
<p>problem with too much Androgen which is</p>
<p>coming from too much insulin</p>
<p>and so inositol which by the way is a</p>
<p>kind of a it&rsquo;s a B vitamin that&rsquo;s sweet</p>
<p>you can suck on them as little candies</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll be like wow this is like</p>
<p>candy but it&rsquo;s not it&rsquo;s a B vitamin and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really good for PCOS polycystic</p>
<p>ovarian syndrome so um but definitely</p>
<p>get on the keto diet because um</p>
<p>you it&rsquo;s not going to work if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>also doing</p>
<p>honoring the benefit of the um</p>
<p>countering it by doing too many carbs</p>
<p>okay very good I found that question uh</p>
<p>it was from Bernal Joy from Facebook</p>
<p>well consuming almond flour bread</p>
<p>regularly affect the kidneys</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>healing with almond flour</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>it is a bit of a refined thing from</p>
<p>almonds it is high in oxalates and those</p>
<p>people that have um</p>
<p>susceptibility to kidney stones could</p>
<p>have a problem it&rsquo;s one of those things</p>
<p>that you would have to try before and</p>
<p>after and see how you feel but these</p>
<p>oxalates</p>
<p>to are damaging to the kidney they are</p>
<p>and so too much too much of them and um</p>
<p>really mess with your kidneys and other</p>
<p>joints so again you have high oxalates</p>
<p>in almonds almond flour</p>
<p>but typically I mean like</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s other benefits from from almonds</p>
<p>but again the key thing is the oxalate</p>
<p>so you would want to avoid of course</p>
<p>rhubarb in the rhubarb pie which I know</p>
<p>Steve loves and then um</p>
<p>chocolate kiwi Swiss chard</p>
<p>and and make mental note Xylitol</p>
<p>Xylitol apparently increases oxlets in</p>
<p>your body or it has oxalates in there so</p>
<p>if you have kidney stones or even pseudo</p>
<p>gout</p>
<p>um it could be aggravated by this darn</p>
<p>Xylitol which you say well I don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>xylitol is a sweetener well do you ever</p>
<p>chew gum as it leads sugar-free gum well</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s load was Xylitol so donatol is in</p>
<p>other things as well</p>
<p>okay watch out for that substance okay</p>
<p>uh Adamson Adamson Adam&rsquo;s son there I</p>
<p>said it right from Facebook any</p>
<p>suggestions to to treat pancreatitis</p>
<p>which I understand is a lot of fun</p>
<p>yeah um I think the first thing I would</p>
<p>do</p>
<p>um if I were you I&rsquo;m assuming you&rsquo;re on</p>
<p>keto and intermittent fasting I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>assuming that I might be wrong but let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>see you are</p>
<p>um and you have pancreatitis one of the</p>
<p>causes of pancreatitis</p>
<p>um would be some type of block</p>
<p>blockage of the duct</p>
<p>um that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>that kind of drains into this little</p>
<p>hole into your small intestine called</p>
<p>this sphincter body which is a small</p>
<p>little valvular</p>
<p>hole that joins with the bile duct so</p>
<p>they have the pancreatic duct the bile</p>
<p>duct they join and so this is why if you</p>
<p>have a deficiency of bile</p>
<p>that can create a sludge</p>
<p>even a stone</p>
<p>and that can block block those ducts and</p>
<p>then back up in the pancreas and you get</p>
<p>pancreatitis so the remedy would be</p>
<p>tatka which is a um</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a type of bile salt but I will</p>
<p>say as a side note since uh our first</p>
<p>guest mentioned iodine if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>deficient at iodine you can also have a</p>
<p>problem with your bile because then the</p>
<p>because the thyroid starts to become</p>
<p>sluggish and without a good thyroid</p>
<p>um your bile gets sluggish as well so</p>
<p>everything can become sluggish</p>
<p>cholesterol</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s the perfect storm because</p>
<p>if you have a slug of thyroid and you</p>
<p>have this</p>
<p>unmetabolized cholesterol buildup</p>
<p>and unavailable cholesterol to make bile</p>
<p>which is it comes from biles comes from</p>
<p>cholesterol so now we get this perfect</p>
<p>storm to make Stones all because you are</p>
<p>low in iodine</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s very common I mean I think</p>
<p>two billion people on this planet are</p>
<p>low on iodide huh and by the way Docker</p>
<p>there are a number of tests for that</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s just one blood test find out</p>
<p>about your iodine</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a there&rsquo;s a lot of tests you can</p>
<p>check your blood test but also um you</p>
<p>can do a patch test and I I have a video</p>
<p>on that you just put a little</p>
<p>uh drop of iodine on your skin and see</p>
<p>if it gets absorbed within a period of</p>
<p>time or or not and</p>
<p>um it absorbs pretty quickly we know</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re probably deficient because your</p>
<p>body is sucking it up the problem with</p>
<p>iodine is that um</p>
<p>our soils are so depleted because we</p>
<p>only put back in three minerals NPK we</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t put the trace minerals back in</p>
<p>there so you&rsquo;re eating all this food</p>
<p>that</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t have iodine because the soil is</p>
<p>not lotified and unless you have</p>
<p>shellfish or seafood or consume plants</p>
<p>that are on 100 miles from the shore</p>
<p>but who does that huh they don&rsquo;t do that</p>
<p>all right well I promise to go to</p>
<p>Denmark and Richard Richard if you&rsquo;d</p>
<p>unmute yourself you are on with Dr bird</p>
<p>yeah thank you very much</p>
<p>[Music]</p>
<p>very much I&rsquo;d like to say that um I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>been on a ketogenic diet now for about</p>
<p>one and a half months</p>
<p>um I had a lot of problems with um</p>
<p>GERD and acid reflux and my blood</p>
<p>pressure was</p>
<p>170 80 over 110 it wasn&rsquo;t as if I was I</p>
<p>was very large</p>
<p>84 kilos 85 kilos now I&rsquo;ve lost six</p>
<p>kilos I&rsquo;m down to 78 and a half oh my</p>
<p>God and my acid reflux has disappeared</p>
<p>wow</p>
<p>um and my blood pressure fell or fell to</p>
<p>126 over 83. wow so all you know it was</p>
<p>uh it was a really a really good wake-up</p>
<p>call however</p>
<p>my blood pressure is done at 180.</p>
<p>um I suspect it&rsquo;s something to do with</p>
<p>my electrolytes I</p>
<p>had blood work done and so I started</p>
<p>taking my blood pressure meds again I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>on losartan medical Valley 100 uh 100</p>
<p>milligrams</p>
<p>but I take my daily hibiscus tea my</p>
<p>wheatgrass and my cod liver oil and</p>
<p>basically I feel like I&rsquo;ve got a new</p>
<p>lease of life so basically how do I</p>
<p>maintain balanced levels of</p>
<p>electrolyzed to bring my blood pressure</p>
<p>down again thank you very much</p>
<p>sure there&rsquo;s two factors to blood</p>
<p>pressure that are the big factors the</p>
<p>obvious ones and especially when you do</p>
<p>the ketogenic diet you lose a lot of</p>
<p>weight you lose a lot of water weight</p>
<p>and you lose a lot of electrolytes so it</p>
<p>you need um about</p>
<p>um 4 700 milligrams now how many uh</p>
<p>what does that come out to</p>
<p>uh with with your Foods it&rsquo;s a that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>lot of greens that&rsquo;s a lot of greens</p>
<p>brings leafy salads to get that much</p>
<p>amount of electrolytes in your body to</p>
<p>get your blood pressure in check but if</p>
<p>you were to consume an electrolyte</p>
<p>powder with a lot more potassium</p>
<p>because out of all the minerals and</p>
<p>vitamins nothing is of the magnitude of</p>
<p>potassium as far as requirements we need</p>
<p>so much</p>
<p>so um that that usually keeps the</p>
<p>arteries very very elastic viable</p>
<p>so it prevents the Harding of the</p>
<p>arteries it helps the kidney believe it</p>
<p>or not and it also can help lower blood</p>
<p>pressure from</p>
<p>several different angles so that&rsquo;s one</p>
<p>thing and also if you have an</p>
<p>electrolyte powder or even consume more</p>
<p>vegetables you also have the Magnesium</p>
<p>with it the magnesium potassium is</p>
<p>the low-hanging fruit to address blood</p>
<p>pressure now other things vitamin D</p>
<p>levels low vitamin D situation can Spike</p>
<p>blood pressure as well</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s another thing that I would</p>
<p>take those are the two things that come</p>
<p>to mind</p>
<p>um that I would go right after and I</p>
<p>think that can bring down the blood</p>
<p>pressure I&rsquo;m glad that your gerd is</p>
<p>going away</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>bird you know bird is like an acid</p>
<p>reflux situation that&rsquo;s more advanced</p>
<p>because it irritates your</p>
<p>your esophagus and uh I always tell</p>
<p>people if you go to the doctor with your</p>
<p>gerd ask the doctor this one question</p>
<p>um what&rsquo;s the difference between</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s try to get to the</p>
<p>differential between</p>
<p>is the this problem too much acid</p>
<p>or is it too much acid in the wrong</p>
<p>place because they never ever ever check</p>
<p>the production of acid in your stomach</p>
<p>they assume that you have your body is</p>
<p>producing too much acid when in fact</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just the opposite if they did test</p>
<p>they would find you&rsquo;re not producing</p>
<p>very much acid at all and that&rsquo;s keeping</p>
<p>the valve open and that&rsquo;s why the acid</p>
<p>is in the wrong place making you assume</p>
<p>that you have too much and then you</p>
<p>you start taking antacids and then</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when things go down south but uh</p>
<p>so anyway that&rsquo;s my long answer to your</p>
<p>simple question</p>
<p>thank you very much um I&rsquo;d just like to</p>
<p>add that I&rsquo;m taking 10 to 20 000 IUS of</p>
<p>vitamin D a day plus around about 500</p>
<p>milligrams of magnesium as well</p>
<p>okay and then I think you&rsquo;re I think you</p>
<p>need to go with the potassium then we</p>
<p>need the problem is if you go try to</p>
<p>find a regular pills I don&rsquo;t know what</p>
<p>they have in Europe now but they&rsquo;re only</p>
<p>like 99 milligrams so</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s ridiculous it&rsquo;s you need to</p>
<p>find something with a lot more</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>um a powder that has a you know at least</p>
<p>a thousand milligrams and take take a</p>
<p>couple scoops of that and that will uh I</p>
<p>think that I think you&rsquo;ll that&rsquo;s your</p>
<p>answer</p>
<p>well I&rsquo;ve ordered your lemon and</p>
<p>raspberry so uh that should be coming</p>
<p>through the post in a few days</p>
<p>okay good yeah I think that&rsquo;ll help all</p>
<p>right thanks so much Richard and uh to</p>
<p>Demons demonstrate here this I just chug</p>
<p>this and Dr Berg was too shy to show his</p>
<p>own product but I&rsquo;m not so there it is</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s coming in the mail to you so</p>
<p>hang on there Richard and it&rsquo;s packed</p>
<p>with all sorts of stuff and I used to</p>
<p>get cramps in my legs when I jog and</p>
<p>then I started taking this and some</p>
<p>extra water I&rsquo;ll admit that too and all</p>
<p>is well so thanks so much Richard from</p>
<p>Denmark for coming on with us let&rsquo;s leap</p>
<p>over and go to the next Quiz question</p>
<p>here it is speaking of antacids and so</p>
<p>on</p>
<p>okay why would antacids Epis</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>which are like um any type of acid</p>
<p>suppression medication why would those</p>
<p>give</p>
<p>a side effect of acid reflux now I</p>
<p>probably just gave out the answer but</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s assume people</p>
<p>say as they&rsquo;re listening intently okay</p>
<p>yeah they were running for a cup of joe</p>
<p>or something I&rsquo;m sure hopefully so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;ll make that interesting okay let</p>
<p>me</p>
<p>Mark that we just put that question</p>
<p>forth and let&rsquo;s go back to social media</p>
<p>Matt from Facebook any advice for</p>
<p>someone who&rsquo;s 32 who eats mostly</p>
<p>carnivore probably less than 1500</p>
<p>calories a day I&rsquo;m still gaining weight</p>
<p>poor guy I ride my bike five miles a day</p>
<p>six steaks six days a week what else</p>
<p>should I be doing goodness</p>
<p>well one of the things that um</p>
<p>with a carnivore diet is um</p>
<p>you can very easily consume a bit too</p>
<p>much protein</p>
<p>and protein does turn to sugar if you</p>
<p>have too much because it&rsquo;s your body</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t assimilate all that so some of</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s converted to glucose and so that</p>
<p>could be one of the reasons why your</p>
<p>insulin is high and you&rsquo;re gaining</p>
<p>weight so how do we fix that</p>
<p>um well then you want to re-evaluate</p>
<p>your food and believe it or not go down</p>
<p>with the protein and up with your fat</p>
<p>now</p>
<p>I know what you&rsquo;re gonna say it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>wait a second how many all this fat I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna well fat won&rsquo;t increase the</p>
<p>insulin it may just help with the</p>
<p>insulin response and lower the insulin</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re having less protein that</p>
<p>ratio is is going to be like more fat</p>
<p>than protein so what what would that</p>
<p>look like as far as types of foods well</p>
<p>they add the fatty sausage</p>
<p>another one is actually that I like is</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>liver yeah you can get in a can and and</p>
<p>it does taste great and you might go</p>
<p>that sounds disgusting but it&rsquo;s a very</p>
<p>high in fat and lower in protein but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a liver</p>
<p>has a lot of the oil in there too so</p>
<p>that that might help you and um then uh</p>
<p>some other ones</p>
<p>um which I don&rsquo;t well if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>carnivore you&rsquo;re not going to do</p>
<p>macadamia nuts or pecans but</p>
<p>um there&rsquo;s other recipes like fatty or</p>
<p>pork you know high quality pork</p>
<p>um but that&rsquo;s probably what you want to</p>
<p>do if you do carnivore and you do lean</p>
<p>uh proteins it&rsquo;s probably not the best</p>
<p>thing also egg eggs that&rsquo;s a good one</p>
<p>and then also organ Meats as well</p>
<p>and uh fatty salmon</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>and then um if you&rsquo;re doing 1500</p>
<p>calories a day and you&rsquo;re exercising</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>you know I don&rsquo;t know also are you doing</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>how frequently are you eating those</p>
<p>meals or what&rsquo;s your intermittent</p>
<p>fasting pattern because</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s just pretend like you&rsquo;re on a 2000</p>
<p>calorie a day diet and you eat all those</p>
<p>2000 calories</p>
<p>in one meal versus spread it out through</p>
<p>the day</p>
<p>either not you&rsquo;ll lose more weight if</p>
<p>you if you eat it one meal</p>
<p>even with the same amount of calories</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re not spreading it out so</p>
<p>the more intermittent fasting you can do</p>
<p>the longer you can fast the more the</p>
<p>weight loss</p>
<p>all right very good uh solid Nate is his</p>
<p>handle from YouTube I have uh</p>
<p>structuring Crohn&rsquo;s with the carnivore</p>
<p>diet help or and or treat my symptoms</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a terrible one</p>
<p>yeah I think it will because the more</p>
<p>you have an irritated uh inflamed colon</p>
<p>the more you need to do</p>
<p>um uh carnivore</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>at least temporarily to kind of let</p>
<p>everything heal up but um that fibers</p>
<p>and vegetables can irritate it and</p>
<p>definitely grains will just kill it um</p>
<p>like especially Wheats and gluten and</p>
<p>all that so uh yeah that&rsquo;s what I would</p>
<p>recommend uh make sure you look up how</p>
<p>to do it healthily and um</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ll find that your inflammation</p>
<p>will drop considerably in your in your</p>
<p>gut</p>
<p>very good I guess</p>
<p>uh hang on just a second here okay</p>
<p>question we&rsquo;ve got answers for quiz</p>
<p>question number three rapidly and it</p>
<p>asks why would antacids ppis acid</p>
<p>suppression give the side effects of</p>
<p>acid reflux which we&rsquo;ve been talking</p>
<p>about a lot today and a hundred percent</p>
<p>of our uh boy here&rsquo;s 100 again</p>
<p>respondents say reductions the</p>
<p>suppression of stomach acid the body can</p>
<p>actually create more acid to make up for</p>
<p>the drop in acid levels</p>
<p>that is true for antacids</p>
<p>um but not necessarily the ppis or H2</p>
<p>inhibitors but anyway</p>
<p>um so so that&rsquo;s an that is a correct</p>
<p>answer oh good um but what happens</p>
<p>with uh with I mean think about this as</p>
<p>you age right the risk of getting gerd</p>
<p>goes up and up as you get older</p>
<p>but at the same time as we age</p>
<p>the amount of the acidity in our stomach</p>
<p>becomes weaker and weaker so how could</p>
<p>it be</p>
<p>that this strong acid this bad acid is</p>
<p>causing gerds the logical</p>
<p>well it has to do with this gerd&rsquo;s gird</p>
<p>is a reflux problem it&rsquo;s a valve problem</p>
<p>and the valve there&rsquo;s sensors there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the valvular sensors for for your acid</p>
<p>so when your acid becomes very very</p>
<p>strong that valve can close really</p>
<p>nicely and can stay tight when the acid</p>
<p>becomes weak it stays open because the</p>
<p>information is getting it&rsquo;s like well</p>
<p>okay food&rsquo;s coming in we better you know</p>
<p>so um the point is that um</p>
<p>if you take an acid like betaine</p>
<p>hydrochloride or any type of</p>
<p>regurgitation problem you have and that</p>
<p>would be heartburn acid reflux gerd</p>
<p>reflex disease silent gerd like there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>20 different labels for the same problem</p>
<p>you generally will feel better</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>and this is why if you have a if there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a skeptic out there that doesn&rsquo;t believe</p>
<p>me and says there&rsquo;s no scientific proof</p>
<p>I said well just go ahead and try it if</p>
<p>you feel better then you know</p>
<p>because</p>
<p>if it is true that you don&rsquo;t have enough</p>
<p>acid for and you have this GERD and you</p>
<p>start taking things to suppress suppress</p>
<p>your acid</p>
<p>guess what&rsquo;s going to happen in the</p>
<p>future as you do this long term you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to go from bad to worse because</p>
<p>without that stomach acid now you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>break down protein you can&rsquo;t absorb iron</p>
<p>or B12 you become anemic you&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>get tired</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re very susceptible to getting</p>
<p>pathogens and viruses that Leach onto</p>
<p>the body</p>
<p>and so you might end up with sibo or a</p>
<p>lot of bloating or other issues</p>
<p>um so there&rsquo;s a lot of problems that can</p>
<p>occur</p>
<p>from these acid suppressing drugs and uh</p>
<p>so again I&rsquo;m gonna I&rsquo;ll create another</p>
<p>video to talk about that because that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like a really important thing for people</p>
<p>to understand if they have this</p>
<p>uh thrawn antacids uh boy that I wish I</p>
<p>would have known about this when I had</p>
<p>an ulcer when I was in my early 20s</p>
<p>which is like</p>
<p>terribly bashed to have that that young</p>
<p>interesting okay speaking of acid true</p>
<p>false our next question all right I&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>let you read it DOC here it is all about</p>
<p>acid</p>
<p>okay true or false stomach acid should</p>
<p>normally be at at least a hundred</p>
<p>thousand times more acid than your blood</p>
<p>is that true or false all right climb on</p>
<p>that audience as I know you will let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>go back to the green room and next up</p>
<p>and ask him to unmute himself his chakra</p>
<p>from Arkansas chakra you&rsquo;re on with Dr</p>
<p>bird</p>
<p>uh hi doctor thanks for all the content</p>
<p>I myself benefited from the intermediate</p>
<p>fasting I was having a pre-diabetic</p>
<p>levels I was having blood pressure</p>
<p>able to follow videos and I was able to</p>
<p>rate myself and I&rsquo;m in better shape now</p>
<p>so the problem is with my kid now she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>six years old</p>
<p>she has autoimmune which ligo condition</p>
<p>the doctor prescribed some oral</p>
<p>ointments the ointment like steroid and</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>the eczema Tropical Islands we don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>want to go that route could you please</p>
<p>help us with what levels of vitamin D</p>
<p>can be given for AC control like zinc</p>
<p>and copper which you are talking about</p>
<p>in the videos</p>
<p>what what uh what specific type of</p>
<p>autoimmune disease did she have</p>
<p>Vitiligo yeah yes okay</p>
<p>yeah</p>
<p>um I would definitely definitely</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>start with the vitamin D uh of course</p>
<p>um son is very therapeutic even certain</p>
<p>types of if I&rsquo;m not mistaken you can try</p>
<p>uh</p>
<p>UVB light therapy that&rsquo;s another one you</p>
<p>can buy one of those little light wands</p>
<p>apparently that&rsquo;s been been shown to</p>
<p>help as well</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>but yeah she needs vitamin D</p>
<p>um I would do definitely I would do</p>
<p>and thousand I use the vitamin D every</p>
<p>day I would do that and again that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to help the immune system I would</p>
<p>also highly recommend uh getting her on</p>
<p>a healthy version of the ketogenic diet</p>
<p>because a lot of these autoimmune</p>
<p>diseases start in the gut so you want to</p>
<p>make sure that that is in check with a</p>
<p>good probiotic</p>
<p>um a natural vitamin B1 would also be</p>
<p>beneficial especially for vitiligo which</p>
<p>is a lack of pigment</p>
<p>giving you these um</p>
<p>wider a lack of like a</p>
<p>like white spots through the body</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>and so that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s what I would do</p>
<p>those two things focus on the gut and</p>
<p>that vitamin D</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>to help that condition so and of course</p>
<p>when kids get autoimmune diseases you</p>
<p>really need to just understand that</p>
<p>something caused it it just doesn&rsquo;t come</p>
<p>for no reason so what happened just</p>
<p>before this occurred and we won&rsquo;t get</p>
<p>into this but that usually there&rsquo;s some</p>
<p>event or something that triggered it</p>
<p>that you need to deal with and that</p>
<p>gives you the big clue on</p>
<p>what you need to focus on because so</p>
<p>many people</p>
<p>have some event that occurs right before</p>
<p>this happening but people don&rsquo;t look at</p>
<p>that as being significant but it&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>important clue on how you should</p>
<p>potentially</p>
<p>treat</p>
<p>someone okay by the way chakra I noticed</p>
<p>that you lost transmission for a while</p>
<p>so I would encourage you to watch the</p>
<p>show afterwards and you&rsquo;ll be able to</p>
<p>recap exactly what Dr Berg said and we</p>
<p>wish you all the best with your</p>
<p>beautiful daughter and hope to hear back</p>
<p>with some great results after the fact</p>
<p>so thank you shocker for coming on and</p>
<p>um and for participating in the show all</p>
<p>right let&rsquo;s see where we&rsquo;re at here</p>
<p>um Karen from YouTube is the carnivore</p>
<p>Diet safe is it better than the keto</p>
<p>diet oh it must be</p>
<p>well uh</p>
<p>the way that I I look at it is this um</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t do the carnivore diet I I do</p>
<p>very very well and sodas do hundreds of</p>
<p>thousands of people on this diet that</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m recommending which is a combination</p>
<p>of plants and and animal Meats as well</p>
<p>because I think there is some a lot of</p>
<p>benefits to plants</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t agree with or I would never</p>
<p>do just a plant diet only so I like the</p>
<p>combination because if you look through</p>
<p>nature you get most of the nutrients I</p>
<p>mean from various you get the nutrients</p>
<p>from various sources not just one thing</p>
<p>uh I like the carnivore for gut issues</p>
<p>but other than that I would recommend</p>
<p>the combination of plants and animal</p>
<p>products</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s one of those things instead of</p>
<p>kind of getting in to tell people this</p>
<p>is the best diet for every single person</p>
<p>you should personally try it out for</p>
<p>yourself and see what works for you</p>
<p>because</p>
<p>um I think those two are going to be</p>
<p>like</p>
<p>the two best things to do depending on</p>
<p>your situation if you don&rsquo;t have a lot</p>
<p>of gut inflammation at all then I would</p>
<p>do I would add the vegetables in there</p>
<p>because that way you can also get plenty</p>
<p>of benefits from the phytonutrients</p>
<p>from Plants the carotenoids</p>
<p>the anthraxanthins which or anthocyanins</p>
<p>I mean that&rsquo;s all these things are are</p>
<p>good for</p>
<p>um all sorts of things</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>the complications from diabetes and then</p>
<p>also um all the potassium magnesium you</p>
<p>can get from vegetables and things like</p>
<p>that and the vitamin C</p>
<p>um there&rsquo;s not a lot of vitamin C in</p>
<p>meat there is some but they&rsquo;re in Oregon</p>
<p>means but there&rsquo;s not a lot</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>and then also folate</p>
<p>folate you can get you get it from dark</p>
<p>leafy greens so there are certain</p>
<p>nutrients But there again if you have</p>
<p>just plants then we&rsquo;re going to get your</p>
<p>B12 then</p>
<p>and your zinc so I think a combination</p>
<p>would be the ideal diet okay very good</p>
<p>in audience next up we have one of our</p>
<p>true falsers which are so fun because we</p>
<p>have a 50 chance of being an absolute</p>
<p>genius and here it is</p>
<p>all right here we go next one</p>
<p>very good doc no we need the answer to</p>
<p>that</p>
<p>yesterday Steve forgive me Doc okay the</p>
<p>answer to that question</p>
<p>um 75 of responders say is true and 25</p>
<p>say it&rsquo;s false there we go</p>
<p>okay well</p>
<p>I said it&rsquo;s at least and so that means</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s basically if we take a</p>
<p>comparison from your blood</p>
<p>to your stomach acid</p>
<p>because see everyone&rsquo;s a lot of people</p>
<p>are against acids like oh we got to</p>
<p>alkalize our body right well then why is</p>
<p>the stomach</p>
<p>so acid normal stomach should be between</p>
<p>a hundred thousand to one million times</p>
<p>more acidic than your blood</p>
<p>that is normal</p>
<p>if our buys were supposed to be alkaline</p>
<p>why is the stomach acid supposed to be</p>
<p>so acid I mean that&rsquo;s like so acid it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like battery acid</p>
<p>um so when we talk about pH we should</p>
<p>have</p>
<p>um you have to ask the person what</p>
<p>specific body tissue are you talking</p>
<p>about or fluid are you talking about the</p>
<p>saliva uh the small intestine the large</p>
<p>intestine but that stomach should be</p>
<p>very very acid and and people don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re kind of on a war to get rid</p>
<p>of acid look at all the acid suppressing</p>
<p>medications out there right</p>
<p>well I would love to ask a doctor don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>we need strong stomach acid what are</p>
<p>these acid suppressing medications going</p>
<p>to do to our stomach acid long term are</p>
<p>there complications are we going to now</p>
<p>break down protein how we&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>absorb minerals how we&rsquo;re going to kill</p>
<p>pathogens in our stomach level these are</p>
<p>all questions that you need to ask the</p>
<p>doctor before you get put on an acid</p>
<p>suppressing medication</p>
<p>all right folks which by the way now</p>
<p>they just I think they have a class</p>
<p>action suit now because now they found</p>
<p>out</p>
<p>the some of these ppis um now I&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>causing kidney disease well we already</p>
<p>kind of the writing&rsquo;s on the wall</p>
<p>unfortunately it&rsquo;s like um</p>
<p>so many medications have been like</p>
<p>recalled or there&rsquo;s been problems down</p>
<p>the road because they</p>
<p>because people take them long term and</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>what are the side effects long term well</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve never done a study on that we just</p>
<p>have to see what happens</p>
<p>okay well you can be the person to</p>
<p>experiment with that then all right good</p>
<p>luck folks with that one okay final</p>
<p>question for the day Doc and there it is</p>
<p>okay what food has the highest source of</p>
<p>coenzyme Q10</p>
<p>all right no more true falsters today</p>
<p>Q10 is good for the heart it&rsquo;s good for</p>
<p>um all of the cells it works within the</p>
<p>mitochondria of your cells so um what</p>
<p>food would have the highest amounts of</p>
<p>that I think that would be good to know</p>
<p>all right very good and we also want to</p>
<p>know what Jason question is and he is</p>
<p>coming to us from Ohio and Jason if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d unmute yourself you&rsquo;re the last</p>
<p>but not least participant uh in our</p>
<p>little green room offering so go ahead</p>
<p>with your one question for Dr Berg in 30</p>
<p>seconds</p>
<p>hey thanks for entertaining my question</p>
<p>um I&rsquo;ve been living with an intractable</p>
<p>24 7 migraine for the past 12 years</p>
<p>which has prevented me from living a</p>
<p>normal life I&rsquo;ve tried almost every</p>
<p>medication on the market as well as many</p>
<p>other treatments non-traditional and</p>
<p>traditional</p>
<p>no long or short-term remedy has really</p>
<p>made a difference I&rsquo;m running out of</p>
<p>ideas of how to fix it routine blood</p>
<p>work and tests usually come back normal</p>
<p>I have been diagnosed with Lyme disease</p>
<p>and some co-infections I also live with</p>
<p>ADHD anxiety depression and Crohn&rsquo;s</p>
<p>colitis</p>
<p>you say Crohn&rsquo;s Crohn&rsquo;s colitis is what</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve I&rsquo;ve heard several different I I</p>
<p>was told originally ulcerative colitis</p>
<p>and now I&rsquo;m told Crohn&rsquo;s colitis</p>
<p>sometimes they just say colitis okay you</p>
<p>gave me a lot of good Clues</p>
<p>um question question I have</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>these terrible migraines that you have</p>
<p>um was there a point in your life ever</p>
<p>that you didn&rsquo;t have them</p>
<p>they were intermittent until I was about</p>
<p>39 and then I had one come on that won&rsquo;t</p>
<p>quit okay</p>
<p>was there anything that occurred</p>
<p>at that right around that time just</p>
<p>before that that might have triggered</p>
<p>this</p>
<p>well it was a stressful time in my life</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d start a new job I was doing these</p>
<p>trainings I had a lot more</p>
<p>responsibility there was a lot going on</p>
<p>in my life at the time yeah okay and and</p>
<p>you said it intermittently like you had</p>
<p>these even as a baby</p>
<p>uh starting around four years old five</p>
<p>years old I would get one it would get</p>
<p>real bad I&rsquo;d throw up I&rsquo;d sleep for</p>
<p>hours or a day or whatever and then I</p>
<p>would resume normal life</p>
<p>okay and then that was you know I&rsquo;d have</p>
<p>one a month or three a year or one a</p>
<p>week or whatever over the years it</p>
<p>varied so in that case I I really think</p>
<p>uh that your problem is related to the</p>
<p>gut because that&rsquo;s usually what happens</p>
<p>when you have it as a baby the food</p>
<p>interacts with the gut and that starts</p>
<p>creating all sorts of issues</p>
<p>um with inflammation and that can cause</p>
<p>headaches and migraines</p>
<p>um so in that case I would seriously</p>
<p>consider getting on the carnivore diet</p>
<p>and um and find out how to do it</p>
<p>healthily</p>
<p>and I I think that will probably be the</p>
<p>thing that&rsquo;s going to turn things around</p>
<p>for you because that&rsquo;s going to drop the</p>
<p>inflammation</p>
<p>versus to try to take a remedy for</p>
<p>something the second thing I would do is</p>
<p>I would do a DNA test</p>
<p>um to find out what the heck is going on</p>
<p>with your genetics because there are so</p>
<p>many genes that could be also</p>
<p>interfering with</p>
<p>your ability to detoxify your oxidative</p>
<p>stress methylation and if you could find</p>
<p>out</p>
<p>something unique about that that can</p>
<p>give you the answer and I&rsquo;ll give you</p>
<p>just one example</p>
<p>um there&rsquo;s a certain Gene</p>
<p>that could be related to this</p>
<p>that is pretty popular</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>but um I don&rsquo;t want to get into</p>
<p>complexities but I actually had someone</p>
<p>as positive for this</p>
<p>Gene and all of they all they needed</p>
<p>uh to do was take um</p>
<p>a very specific type of B12 and folic</p>
<p>acid methylfolate</p>
<p>and oh my goodness uh their whole life</p>
<p>changed just from this one genetic test</p>
<p>just learning about one thing that they</p>
<p>had a problem with so that&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>another thing that I would do to see um</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s because that&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>actually help you tailor make</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>foods and recommendations</p>
<p>more deeply than any any other thing</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a new thing you have to find</p>
<p>someone good to help you interpret that</p>
<p>but you definitely the DNA testing and</p>
<p>then get on Carnivore and I think um I</p>
<p>would love to how do you do that and</p>
<p>then come back to us in a few weeks to</p>
<p>see if that gave you more relief</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to all right that&rsquo;s great that</p>
<p>sounds just awful Jason so we&rsquo;d love for</p>
<p>you to get some relief from that so</p>
<p>thanks so much</p>
<p>you know in these things it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>usually something</p>
<p>in the diet that&rsquo;s creating inflammation</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s because the there&rsquo;s this</p>
<p>separation between your gut and your in</p>
<p>your head</p>
<p>um but you have the vagus nerve so</p>
<p>whatever&rsquo;s going on up here in the head</p>
<p>headache wise or pain or whatever even</p>
<p>depression anxiety boy that could be all</p>
<p>coming from your gut and so</p>
<p>but because it&rsquo;s referred you a lot of</p>
<p>times people don&rsquo;t make the connection</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ll tell you</p>
<p>it could be a game changer and I think</p>
<p>there&rsquo;ll be some I think it&rsquo;ll make a</p>
<p>huge change but um I&rsquo;ve seen it so many</p>
<p>times all right well Jason please get</p>
<p>back with us we&rsquo;d really love to hear</p>
<p>that you get some relief that&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>awful four years on oh you know that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not fair all right uh Jason I I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t think you had time to look at this</p>
<p>question but we&rsquo;ll give you the answer</p>
<p>so it asks what food has the highest</p>
<p>source of CoQ10 and our audience said 45</p>
<p>at least said our responders say it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>beef heart 25</p>
<p>uh say Oregon meets ten percent say liba</p>
<p>ten percent say cod liver which you</p>
<p>spoke of or fish oil and 10 say salmon</p>
<p>oh</p>
<p>yeah so the answer is beef heart</p>
<p>beef heart wow</p>
<p>um now I know probably most people</p>
<p>nowadays don&rsquo;t are listening don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>normally consume beef heart as in their</p>
<p>diet</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even know where you can find it</p>
<p>but I will say that um</p>
<p>it has some serious benefits uh for I</p>
<p>mean it has um an ungodly amount of</p>
<p>coenzyme Q10 which is what can really</p>
<p>help your energy and um</p>
<p>and so</p>
<p>there are certain supplements that</p>
<p>people can get</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>they can get like beef liver like</p>
<p>grass-fed</p>
<p>um not beef liver but hard liver or</p>
<p>Heart beef heart and then also</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>if someone has like some type of bad</p>
<p>cardiovascular</p>
<p>issue let&rsquo;s say they have a problem with</p>
<p>like a repeated heart attacks or or um</p>
<p>problems with the heart and muscle where</p>
<p>they have them angina</p>
<p>and they took</p>
<p>uh beef heart as a supplement or even</p>
<p>consumed it</p>
<p>boy they would</p>
<p>greatly improve from that condition so</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s something that consider it&rsquo;s uh</p>
<p>I just want to put this on your radar so</p>
<p>you could have it as a an idea to fall</p>
<p>back on if you do you need some extra</p>
<p>coenzyme Q10 because there&rsquo;s even a</p>
<p>company called um</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s called let&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s the grass-fed</p>
<p>meat um U.S Wellness Meats U.S Wellness</p>
<p>Meats</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>cells</p>
<p>a hamburger with some added</p>
<p>beef heart and I bought that in the past</p>
<p>and you could hardly even taste it it</p>
<p>says it just tastes just like regular</p>
<p>hamburger but I tell you that would</p>
<p>really be a healthier product than just</p>
<p>the beef meat so it&rsquo;s all grass-fed it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>for U.S Wellness meats and so that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just doing a plug for them because um</p>
<p>they have really very great products and</p>
<p>of course before my farm I used to order</p>
<p>a lot but now I have so much beef in my</p>
<p>freezer that I will never run out ever</p>
<p>on that note Steve I really appreciate</p>
<p>all the wonderful comments and questions</p>
<p>um thank you again for staying on this</p>
<p>long uh and we have some great videos</p>
<p>coming up and I will see you guys next</p>
<p>Friday</p>
<p>in the morning at 11 o&rsquo;clock AM Eastern</p>
<p>Standard Time</p>
<p>[Music]</p>
<p>thank you</p>
