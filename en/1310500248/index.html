    <p>The following is a conversation with Robert Cruz,</p>
<p>a historian at Stanford, specializing in the history</p>
<p>of Afghanistan, Russia, and Islam.</p>
<p>This is the Lex Friedman podcast.</p>
<p>To support it, please check out our sponsors</p>
<p>in the description.</p>
<p>And now, here&rsquo;s my conversation with Robert Cruz.</p>
<p>Was it a mistake for the United States</p>
<p>to invade Afghanistan in 2001, 20 years ago?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>As simple as yes, why was it a mistake?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a historian, so I say this with some humility</p>
<p>about what we can know.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;d still like to know much more</p>
<p>about what was going on in the White House</p>
<p>in the hours, days, weeks after 9 11.</p>
<p>But I think the George W. Bush administration</p>
<p>acted in a state of panic.</p>
<p>And I think they wanted to show a kind of toughness.</p>
<p>They wanted to show some kind of resolve.</p>
<p>This was a horrific act that played out</p>
<p>on everyone&rsquo;s television screens.</p>
<p>And I think it was really fundamentally</p>
<p>a crisis of legitimacy within the White House,</p>
<p>within the Oval Office.</p>
<p>And I think they felt like they had to do something</p>
<p>and something dramatic.</p>
<p>I think they didn&rsquo;t really think through</p>
<p>who they were fighting, who the enemy was,</p>
<p>what this geography had to do with 9 11.</p>
<p>I think looking back at it, I mean, some of us,</p>
<p>not to say I was clairvoyant or could see into the future,</p>
<p>but I think many of us were, from that morning,</p>
<p>skeptical about the connections that people were drawing</p>
<p>between Afghanistan as a state, as a place,</p>
<p>and the actions of Al Qaeda in Washington</p>
<p>and New York and Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>So as you watch the events of 9 11,</p>
<p>the things that our leaders were saying</p>
<p>in the minutes, hours, days, weeks that followed,</p>
<p>maybe you can give a little bit of a timeline</p>
<p>of what was being said.</p>
<p>One was the actual invasion of Afghanistan.</p>
<p>And also, what were your feelings</p>
<p>in the minutes, weeks after 9 11?</p>
<p>I was in DC.</p>
<p>I was on the way to American University</p>
<p>hearing on NPR what had happened.</p>
<p>And I thought of the American University logo,</p>
<p>which is red, white, and blue.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an eagle.</p>
<p>And I thought Washington is under attack</p>
<p>and symbols of American power are under attack.</p>
<p>And so I was quite concerned and at the time lived</p>
<p>just a few miles from the capital.</p>
<p>And so I felt that it was real.</p>
<p>So I appreciate the sense of anxiety and fear and panic.</p>
<p>And four, two, three years later in DC,</p>
<p>we were constantly getting reports,</p>
<p>mostly rumors and unconfirmed about all kinds of attacks</p>
<p>that befall the city.</p>
<p>So I definitely appreciate the sense of being under assault.</p>
<p>But in watching television,</p>
<p>including Russian television that day,</p>
<p>because I just installed a satellite thing.</p>
<p>So I was trying to watch world news</p>
<p>and get different points of view.</p>
<p>And that was quite useful</p>
<p>to have an alternative set of eyes.</p>
<p>In Russian?</p>
<p>Yeah, in Russian, yeah.</p>
<p>Okay, so your Russians is good enough</p>
<p>to understand Russian television.</p>
<p>The news, yeah, the news and the visuals that were coming</p>
<p>that were not shown on American television.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how they had it, but they had,</p>
<p>they were not filtering anything</p>
<p>in the way that the major networks</p>
<p>and cable televisions were doing here.</p>
<p>So it was a very unvarnished view of the violence</p>
<p>of the moment in New York City</p>
<p>of people diving from the towers or being,</p>
<p>and it was really, they didn&rsquo;t hold back on that,</p>
<p>which was quite fascinating.</p>
<p>I think much of the world saw much more</p>
<p>than actually the American public saw.</p>
<p>But to your question, amid that feeling of imminent doom,</p>
<p>I watched commentators start to talk about Al Qaeda</p>
<p>and then talk about Afghanistan.</p>
<p>And one of the experts was Barnett Rubin,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s at NYU, who&rsquo;s a kind of long,</p>
<p>very learned Afghanistan hand.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s brought on Peter Jennings on ABC News</p>
<p>to kind of lay this out for everyone.</p>
<p>And I thought, you know, he did a fine job,</p>
<p>but I think it was formative in submitting the view</p>
<p>that somehow Al Qaeda was synonymous</p>
<p>with this space, Afghanistan.</p>
<p>And I think, again, I was no Al Qaeda expert then,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m not now, but I think my immediate thought</p>
<p>went to war and because my background had been with,</p>
<p>at that point, mostly Afghans who had been displaced</p>
<p>from decades of war,</p>
<p>whom I encountered in Uzbekistan,</p>
<p>who were refugees and so on.</p>
<p>I thought immediately, my mind went to the suffering</p>
<p>of Afghan people, that this war was going to sweep up,</p>
<p>of course, the defenseless people</p>
<p>who have nothing to do with these politics.</p>
<p>So we should give maybe a little bit of context</p>
<p>that you could speak to.</p>
<p>So assume nobody&rsquo;s an expert at anything.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s just say you and I are not experts at anything.</p>
<p>What, as a historian, were you studying at the time</p>
<p>and thinking about, is it the full global history</p>
<p>of Afghanistan?</p>
<p>Is it the region?</p>
<p>Were you thinking about the Mujahideen</p>
<p>and Al Qaeda and Taliban?</p>
<p>Were you thinking about the Soviet Union,</p>
<p>the proxy war through Afghanistan?</p>
<p>Were you thinking about Iraq and oil?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the full space of things in your heart,</p>
<p>in your mind at the time?</p>
<p>I mean, just at the moment, of course, it was just the sense</p>
<p>of the suffering and the tragedy</p>
<p>of the moment of the deaths.</p>
<p>And that was, I think, I was preoccupied</p>
<p>by the violence of the moment.</p>
<p>But as the conversation turned to Afghanistan,</p>
<p>as a kind of theater, to somehow respond to this moment,</p>
<p>I think immediately what came to mind</p>
<p>was that little I knew about Al Qaeda at the time</p>
<p>suggested that the geography was inaccurate,</p>
<p>that this was a global network, a global threat,</p>
<p>that this was a movement that went beyond borders.</p>
<p>And I think that it felt early on</p>
<p>that Afghanistan was gonna be used as a scapegoat.</p>
<p>And intellectually at the time,</p>
<p>I was teaching at American University.</p>
<p>My courses touched on a range of subjects,</p>
<p>but I was trying to complete a book</p>
<p>on Islam and the Russian Empire, actually.</p>
<p>But in doing that research, which took me across Russia</p>
<p>and Central Asia, purely by accident,</p>
<p>I had developed an interest in Afghanistan</p>
<p>because just, again, a series of coincidences.</p>
<p>I found myself in Tashkent, the capital of Uzbekistan,</p>
<p>without housing, through an American friend</p>
<p>who was like the king of the market in Tashkent.</p>
<p>He knew everyone.</p>
<p>He ran into some Afghan merchants there.</p>
<p>They found out I didn&rsquo;t have a place to live.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know where Afghanistan was, honestly.</p>
<p>This was 1997.</p>
<p>I had a vague idea it was next door.</p>
<p>Well, you lived in Uzbekistan?</p>
<p>Yeah, in Tashkent, doing dissertation research, yeah.</p>
<p>Because it was hub of the Russian Empire in Central Asia.</p>
<p>So just by accident, I met with these young Afghans</p>
<p>who took me in as roommates.</p>
<p>And that, I think, the sense of that community</p>
<p>shaped my idea of what Afghanistan is.</p>
<p>It was my first exposure to them.</p>
<p>They were part of a trading diaspora.</p>
<p>They had brought matches from Riga, Latvia.</p>
<p>They had somehow brought flour</p>
<p>and some agricultural products from Egypt.</p>
<p>And they were sitting in closed containers in Tashkent</p>
<p>waiting for the Uzbekistan state to permit them to trade.</p>
<p>So these guys are mostly hanging out during the day.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll get dressed up.</p>
<p>They put on suits and ties like you&rsquo;re wearing.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;d polish their shoes.</p>
<p>And they would sit around offices, drink tea, pistachios.</p>
<p>Then they&rsquo;d feast at lunch.</p>
<p>And then at night, we would go out.</p>
<p>So part of my research,</p>
<p>because I also had a bottleneck in my research,</p>
<p>I was going to the state archives in Tashkent.</p>
<p>And because of the state of Uzbekistan,</p>
<p>that was a very kind of suspicious thing to do.</p>
<p>So it took a while to get in.</p>
<p>So I had downtime in Tashkent, just like these guys.</p>
<p>So I got to know them pretty well.</p>
<p>And it was really just an accidental kind of thing,</p>
<p>but grew quite close to them.</p>
<p>And I developed an appreciation of,</p>
<p>which now I think, again, thinking of the seeds of all this,</p>
<p>these people had already lived,</p>
<p>young guys in their 20s,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;d already lived in six or seven countries.</p>
<p>They all spoke half a dozen languages.</p>
<p>One of my best friends there had been a kickboxer</p>
<p>and break dancer, trained in Tehran.</p>
<p>His father was a theater person in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>He told stories of escaping death in Afghanistan</p>
<p>during the civil war, going to Uzbekistan,</p>
<p>escaping death there.</p>
<p>And these were very real stories.</p>
<p>Can you also just briefly mention,</p>
<p>geographically speaking,</p>
<p>Afghanistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, you mentioned Iran.</p>
<p>Who are the neighbors of all of this?</p>
<p>What are we supposed to be thinking about for people?</p>
<p>I was always terrible at geography and spatial information.</p>
<p>So can you lay it out?</p>
<p>Yeah, sure, sure.</p>
<p>So Tashkent is the capital of Uzbekistan.</p>
<p>It was a hub of Russian imperial power in the 19th century.</p>
<p>The Russians take the city from a local kind of Muslim</p>
<p>dynasty in 1865.</p>
<p>It becomes the city, the kind of hub of Soviet power</p>
<p>in Central Asia after 1917.</p>
<p>It becomes the center of the Soviet Republic of Uzbekistan,</p>
<p>which becomes independent finally in 1991</p>
<p>when the Soviet Union collapses.</p>
<p>So these are all like these republics</p>
<p>are the fingertips of Soviet power in Central Asia.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ve been independent since 1991,</p>
<p>but they have struggled to disentangle themselves</p>
<p>from Moscow, from one another.</p>
<p>And now they face very serious pressure from China</p>
<p>to form a kind of periphery of the great machine</p>
<p>that is the Chinese economy and its ambitions</p>
<p>to stretch across Asia.</p>
<p>For Afghanistan, where my roommates, my friends</p>
<p>hailed from, Afghanistan had fallen into civil war</p>
<p>in the late 1970s when leftists tried</p>
<p>to seize power there in 1978.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union then extended from Uzbekistan,</p>
<p>crossing the border with its forces in 1979</p>
<p>to try to shore up this leftist government</p>
<p>that had seized power in 1978.</p>
<p>And so for Central Asians in the wider region,</p>
<p>their fate had for some decades been tied to Afghanistan</p>
<p>in a variety of ways, but it became much more connected</p>
<p>in the 1980s when the Soviet Red Army occupied Afghanistan</p>
<p>for 10 years.</p>
<p>And here, I refer your listeners and viewers</p>
<p>to Rainbow Three as the guide to.</p>
<p>The historically accurate guide.</p>
<p>The historically accurate, the Bible.</p>
<p>The Bible of Afghan history in Rainbow Three, yeah.</p>
<p>As a fantastic window onto the American view of the war.</p>
<p>But for us Afghans, there are people who fought</p>
<p>against the Soviet army, but of a certain generation,</p>
<p>the guys I knew, their mission was to survive.</p>
<p>And so they fled in waves by the millions</p>
<p>to Pakistan, to Iran.</p>
<p>Some went north into Soviet Central Asia later in the 1990s.</p>
<p>And some were displaced across the planet.</p>
<p>So California, where we&rsquo;re sitting today,</p>
<p>has a large community that came in the 80s and 90s</p>
<p>in the East Bay.</p>
<p>Can I ask a quick question that&rsquo;s a little bit of a tangent?</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>What is the correct or the respectful way</p>
<p>to pronounce Afghanistan, Afghanistan, Iran, Iran?</p>
<p>So as a Russian speaker, Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>The an versus the an.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Is it a different country by country?</p>
<p>As an English speaker in America,</p>
<p>is it pretentious and disrespectful to say Afghanistan?</p>
<p>Or is it the opposite, respectful to say it that way?</p>
<p>What are your thoughts on this?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a fascinating question.</p>
<p>I defer to the people from those countries</p>
<p>to, of course, sort out those politics.</p>
<p>I think one of the fascinating things about the region</p>
<p>broadly is that it is a place of so many cultures</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s really quite cosmopolitan.</p>
<p>So I think people are mostly quite forgiving</p>
<p>about how you say Afghanistan, Afghanistan.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like Paris.</p>
<p>Yeah, right, right.</p>
<p>The French are not forgiving.</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>I think people are very, very forgiving.</p>
<p>And I think that Iranians are a bit more instructive</p>
<p>in suggesting Iran rather than Iran, Iraq, Iraq.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s going to be a fit</p>
<p>between certain ways of pronouncing these places</p>
<p>and the position that Americans take about them.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s more jarring when people say Iraq</p>
<p>and it comes with a claim that a certain kind of person</p>
<p>should be the victim of violence or.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of like talking about the Democratic Party</p>
<p>or the Democrat Party.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sometimes using certain kind of terminology</p>
<p>to make a little bit of a sort of implied statement</p>
<p>about your beliefs.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, I think when I hear Iraq and Iran,</p>
<p>I mean, I think it, yeah, is it intentional</p>
<p>in the case of a Democrat or is it just a,</p>
<p>you know, and it&rsquo;s a whatever.</p>
<p>Again, I think most Iranians and Afghans people I know</p>
<p>have been very cool about that.</p>
<p>What annoys Afghans now, I can say,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s fair to say,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t mean to speak for many people,</p>
<p>for the entire group of people,</p>
<p>but I can just share with our non Afghan friends.</p>
<p>The term Afghani is a kind of term of offense</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s the name of the currency.</p>
<p>And so lots of people ask, you know, why having,</p>
<p>especially again, it&rsquo;s more directed at Americans</p>
<p>because, you know, we&rsquo;ve been so deeply involved</p>
<p>in that country obviously for the last 20 years, right?</p>
<p>So Afghans ask why after 20 years,</p>
<p>are you still calling us the wrong name?</p>
<p>What is the right name of somebody?</p>
<p>They prefer Afghans.</p>
<p>Afghans.</p>
<p>Yeah, and Afghani is the name of the currency.</p>
<p>And so.</p>
<p>I just dodged a bullet</p>
<p>because I was gonna say Afghans.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s cool, no, no, no, yeah, I hear you.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really great to know.</p>
<p>Yeah, and it&rsquo;s, again, I think,</p>
<p>but I would emphasize that people are quite open</p>
<p>and, you know, it&rsquo;s a whole region of incredible diversity</p>
<p>and respect for linguistic pluralism actually.</p>
<p>So I think that, you know,</p>
<p>but I also appreciate that in this context,</p>
<p>when there&rsquo;s a lot of pain, you know,</p>
<p>in the Afghan diaspora community in particular,</p>
<p>you know, being called the wrong name after 20 years</p>
<p>when they already feel so betrayed at this moment,</p>
<p>you know, just kind of,</p>
<p>if one follows this on social media,</p>
<p>that is one kind of hot wire, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, so the reason I ask about pronunciation</p>
<p>is because, yes, it is true</p>
<p>that there are certain things when mispronounced</p>
<p>kind of reveal that you don&rsquo;t care enough</p>
<p>to pronounce correctly.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know enough to pronounce correctly</p>
<p>and you dismiss the culture and the people,</p>
<p>which I think as per your writing is something that,</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s okay, I&rsquo;ll go with Afghanistan</p>
<p>just because I&rsquo;m used to it.</p>
<p>I say Iraq, Iran, but I say Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>As you do in your writing,</p>
<p>Afghanistan suffers from much misunderstanding</p>
<p>from the rest of the world.</p>
<p>But back to our discussion of Uzbekistan, Tajikistan,</p>
<p>the whole region that gives us context</p>
<p>for the events of 9 11.</p>
<p>Right, right.</p>
<p>So yeah, if we go back to that day</p>
<p>and the weeks that followed,</p>
<p>in my mind went to the community I knew in Tashkent,</p>
<p>which was interesting.</p>
<p>I mean, they were,</p>
<p>so Islam was the focal point of our conversation in the US</p>
<p>about 9 11, right?</p>
<p>Everyone to know what was the relationship</p>
<p>between the civic violence and that religious tradition</p>
<p>with its 1 billion plus followers across the globe, right?</p>
<p>That became the issue, of course,</p>
<p>for American security institutions,</p>
<p>for local state and police institutions, right?</p>
<p>I mean, it became the,</p>
<p>I think it was the question</p>
<p>that most Americans had on their mind.</p>
<p>So again, I didn&rsquo;t imagine myself as someone</p>
<p>who had all the answers, of course,</p>
<p>but given my background</p>
<p>and coming at this from Russian history,</p>
<p>coming at this from studying empire</p>
<p>and trying to think about the region broadly,</p>
<p>I was very alarmed at the way that the conversation went.</p>
<p>Can I ask you a question?</p>
<p>What was your feeling on that morning of 9 11?</p>
<p>Who did this?</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t that a natural feeling?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s coupled with fear of what&rsquo;s next,</p>
<p>especially when you&rsquo;re in DC,</p>
<p>but also who is this?</p>
<p>Is this an accident?</p>
<p>Is this a deliberate terrorist attack?</p>
<p>Is this domestic?</p>
<p>What were your thoughts of the options</p>
<p>and the internal ranking given your expertise?</p>
<p>I suppose I was taken by the narrative</p>
<p>that this was international.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;d also lived in New York</p>
<p>during one of the first bombings in 94</p>
<p>of the World Trade Center.</p>
<p>So it was clear to me that a radical community</p>
<p>had really fixed New York as part of their imagination of,</p>
<p>and I immediately thought it was a kind of blow</p>
<p>to American power.</p>
<p>And I was drawn by the symbolism of it.</p>
<p>If you think of it as an act,</p>
<p>it was a kind of an act of speech, if you will,</p>
<p>a kind of a way of speaking to,</p>
<p>from a position of relative weakness,</p>
<p>speaking to an imperial power.</p>
<p>And I saw it as a kind of symbolic speech act of that</p>
<p>with horrific real world consequences</p>
<p>for all those innocent victims,</p>
<p>for the firemen, for the police,</p>
<p>and just the horror of the moment.</p>
<p>So I did see it as transcending the United States,</p>
<p>but I did not see it as really having anything necessarily</p>
<p>to do fundamentally about Afghanistan</p>
<p>and the history of the region that I&rsquo;d been studying</p>
<p>and the community people that I knew</p>
<p>who were not particularly religious.</p>
<p>The guys I hung out with actually wore me out</p>
<p>because they wanted to go out every night.</p>
<p>They wanted to party every night.</p>
<p>Drinking?</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>We had discussions about alcohol.</p>
<p>I mean, Uzbekistan is famous for its, you know.</p>
<p>Drinking.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s drinking.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s something to look forward to.</p>
<p>So I do want to travel to that part of the world.</p>
<p>When was the last time you were in that part of the world?</p>
<p>Early 2000s.</p>
<p>Well, in the mid 2000s, 2010s.</p>
<p>So wait, so by the way, what drinking?</p>
<p>Vodka?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the, what&rsquo;s the weapon of choice?</p>
<p>Uzbekistan has incorporated vodka as the choice.</p>
<p>And that, and it informs, you know, and it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>but the fascinating thing, you know, as a student,</p>
<p>is what you&rsquo;re observing as a non Muslim.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;m a non Russian.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m, this is all, you know, culturally new to me.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m, you know, a student of all that, right?</p>
<p>As a grad student doing my work there.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re like Jane Goodall of vodka and Russia.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just observing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>You get the Samogon, the grass vodka.</p>
<p>You get, you know, I have,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had some long nights on the Kazakhstan frontier</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m not proud of, you know.</p>
<p>But you got to know the people</p>
<p>and some of them from, from, from.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>But intellectually, so the thing, I mean,</p>
<p>the fascinating thing there was that, and just as a,</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s a whole, you know, I&rsquo;m a historian, right?</p>
<p>But there, there are great contributions by, you know,</p>
<p>anthropologists and ethnographers who,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;ve gone across the planet</p>
<p>and try to understand how Muslims understand the tradition</p>
<p>at different contexts.</p>
<p>So many Uzbeks will say, you know,</p>
<p>this is part of our national culture</p>
<p>to drink and eat as we please, right?</p>
<p>And yet I&rsquo;m a very devout Muslim.</p>
<p>And so of course you can encounter</p>
<p>other Muslim communities who won&rsquo;t touch alcohol, right?</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s become kind of, I think it&rsquo;s very much,</p>
<p>you know, Soviet culture left a deep impression</p>
<p>in each of these places.</p>
<p>And so there are ways of thinking,</p>
<p>ways of performing, ways of, you know, enjoying oneself</p>
<p>that are shared across Soviet and former Soviet space</p>
<p>to this day, right?</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ve written also about Muslims in the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an article that, there was a paywall,</p>
<p>so I couldn&rsquo;t read it and I really want to read it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a Moscow in the mosque or something like that.</p>
<p>By the way, just another tangent on a tangent.</p>
<p>So I bought all your books.</p>
<p>I love them very much.</p>
<p>One of the reasons I bought them and read many parts</p>
<p>is because they&rsquo;re easy to buy.</p>
<p>Unlike articles, every single website has a paywall.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s very frustrating to read brilliant scholars</p>
<p>such as yourself.</p>
<p>I wish there was one fee I could pay everywhere.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care what that fee is,</p>
<p>where it gives, allows me to read</p>
<p>some of your brilliant writing.</p>
<p>No, no, thank you, I hear you.</p>
<p>I think moving toward more kind of open source</p>
<p>formatting stuff I think is what a lot of journals</p>
<p>are thinking about now and I think it&rsquo;s definitely</p>
<p>for the kind of democratization of knowledge and scholarship</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s definitely an important thing</p>
<p>that we should all think about.</p>
<p>And I think we need to exert pressure on these publishers</p>
<p>to do that, so I appreciate that.</p>
<p>This is what I&rsquo;m doing here.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah, good, good, I appreciate it.</p>
<p>So your thought was Afghanistan is not going to be</p>
<p>to be the center, the source of where.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the center of this and invading that country</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t gonna fix the toxic milestone of politics</p>
<p>that produced 9 11, right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just thinking of some of the personalities,</p>
<p>just thinking about going back to the Tashkent story</p>
<p>which I&rsquo;ll end with.</p>
<p>I mean, just observing real Muslims doing things</p>
<p>and then asking questions about it</p>
<p>and trying to understand through their eyes</p>
<p>what the tradition means to them.</p>
<p>And then we had a very narrow conversation</p>
<p>about what Islam is that generated, immediately exploded</p>
<p>on the day of 9 11, right?</p>
<p>And then of course, I think the antipathy toward Islam</p>
<p>and Muslims was informed by racism, informed by xenophobia.</p>
<p>So it became a perfect storm I think of demonization</p>
<p>that didn&rsquo;t sit with what I knew about the tradition</p>
<p>and with actual people that I had known</p>
<p>because then going back to, I mean, there were other friends</p>
<p>and encounters and so on, but just thinking about Afghanistan</p>
<p>and Tashkent for a moment, I mean,</p>
<p>just thought about my friends who had been,</p>
<p>who had suffered a great deal in their short lives,</p>
<p>who had been cast aside from country to country,</p>
<p>but had found a place in Tashkent</p>
<p>with some relative stability.</p>
<p>And they wanted to go out every night</p>
<p>and they explained, one friend,</p>
<p>we talked about it with the alcohol and all that</p>
<p>and he didn&rsquo;t get crazy, but he was like,</p>
<p>you can drink, but just don&rsquo;t get drunk.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s permissible within Islam, right?</p>
<p>And he was an ethnic Pashtun.</p>
<p>I think Uzbeks had a different view,</p>
<p>often the more vodka the better,</p>
<p>and it doesn&rsquo;t violate, as I understand Islam.</p>
<p>So even, it&rsquo;s kind of a silly example,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s just an illustration of the ways in which</p>
<p>different communities, different generations,</p>
<p>different people can come at this very complex rich tradition</p>
<p>in so many different ways.</p>
<p>So obviously, whatever kind of scholar you are,</p>
<p>or any kind of expert, whatever,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s always disconcerting to see</p>
<p>your field of specialization be flattened, right?</p>
<p>And then be flattened and then be turned</p>
<p>to arguments for violence, right?</p>
<p>Mixed up with the natural human feelings of hate.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>And depression. And hurt at that moment, and pain.</p>
<p>So, I mean, that day I vividly remember,</p>
<p>I sat with other PhD historians in different fields.</p>
<p>We, oddly enough, had lunch that day</p>
<p>and it kind of deserted Washington.</p>
<p>Some place was open when we went.</p>
<p>And we just thought, you know,</p>
<p>this is going to kind of open up</p>
<p>like a great mall of destruction.</p>
<p>And, you know, the American state is going to destroy</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s going to destroy in this geography.</p>
<p>And I thought that was misplaced for lots of reasons.</p>
<p>And then I think if one, you know,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d been doing some research on Afghanistan then,</p>
<p>I was kind of shifting to the South</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;d been looking at the Taliban from afar</p>
<p>for some years.</p>
<p>And, you know, I think it&rsquo;s clear now</p>
<p>that in retrospect there were opportunities</p>
<p>for alternative policies at that moment.</p>
<p>So what should the conversation have been like?</p>
<p>What should we have done differently?</p>
<p>Because, you know, from a perspective of the time,</p>
<p>the United States was invaded by a foreign force.</p>
<p>What is the proper response</p>
<p>or what is the proper conversation</p>
<p>about the proper response at the time, you think?</p>
<p>You know, I know my colleague at Stanford,</p>
<p>Condoleezza Rice would tell me this is above my pay grade.</p>
<p>And, you know, she makes a point in her classes</p>
<p>to talk about how difficult decision making is</p>
<p>under such intense pressure.</p>
<p>And I appreciate that.</p>
<p>You know, I am a historian who sits safely in my office.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like battlefields.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like taking risks.</p>
<p>So I can see all those limits.</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;m not a military expert.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been accused of being a spy wherever I&rsquo;ve gone</p>
<p>because of the way I look</p>
<p>and because of my nationality and so on, but I&rsquo;m not a spy.</p>
<p>So I defer, you know, I respect the expertise</p>
<p>of all those communities.</p>
<p>But I think they acted out of ignorance.</p>
<p>They acted, I think, because, I mean, you think of the,</p>
<p>in a way there was a compensatory aspect</p>
<p>of this decision making.</p>
<p>I mean, the Bush administration failed.</p>
<p>This was an extraordinary failure, right?</p>
<p>So if we start.</p>
<p>In which way?</p>
<p>Can we break down the nation?</p>
<p>Of intelligence.</p>
<p>I mean, if they, you know,</p>
<p>if you follow the story of Richard Clarke.</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s Richard Clarke?</p>
<p>He was a national security expert</p>
<p>who was tasked with following Al Qaeda,</p>
<p>who had produced a dossier under the Clinton administration</p>
<p>that he passed on to the George W. Bush administration.</p>
<p>And if you look at the work of Condoleezza Rice,</p>
<p>she wrote a very famous, I think, unpaywalled</p>
<p>foreign affairs article that you can read,</p>
<p>announcing the George W. Bush foreign policy kind of outlook.</p>
<p>And it was all about great powers.</p>
<p>It was about the rise of China.</p>
<p>It was about Russia.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s definitely a kind of hangover</p>
<p>of those who missed having Russia as the boogeyman.</p>
<p>Who spoke, you know, the Clinton administration</p>
<p>repeated again and again the idea of making sure</p>
<p>the bear stayed in his cage.</p>
<p>Which is why the United States threw a lifeline</p>
<p>to the Central Asian states, hoping to have pipelines,</p>
<p>hoping to shore up their national sovereignty</p>
<p>as a way of containing Russia initially, but also Iran,</p>
<p>you know, which sits to the south and west.</p>
<p>And then peripherally looking down the road</p>
<p>to China to the east.</p>
<p>So the bear is what, like Russia?</p>
<p>Or is it kind of like some weird combination</p>
<p>of Russia, Iran, and China?</p>
<p>The bear is Russia and Russia is this thing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to characterize the imagination</p>
<p>of some of these national security figures.</p>
<p>This is an image formed in the Cold War.</p>
<p>I mean, it has deeper seeds in European</p>
<p>and Western intellectual thought that go back</p>
<p>at least to the 1850s and the reign of Tsar Nicholas I.</p>
<p>When we first get this language about the Russian Empire</p>
<p>as this kind of evil polity.</p>
<p>Obviously this was a kind of pillar of Reaganism.</p>
<p>But the Clinton folks kept that alive.</p>
<p>They wanted to make sure that American power</p>
<p>would be unmatched.</p>
<p>And they, being creatures of the Cold War themselves,</p>
<p>they looked to Russia as a recession power</p>
<p>well before Putin was even thought of.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, this is, you mentioned one deep,</p>
<p>profound historical piece in Rambo.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably, this conflict has to do</p>
<p>with another Sylvester Stallone movie,</p>
<p>a Rocky IV, which is also historically accurate</p>
<p>and based on, it&rsquo;s basically a documentary.</p>
<p>So there is something about the American power,</p>
<p>even at the level of Condoleezza Rice,</p>
<p>these respected deep kind of leaders and thinkers</p>
<p>about history and the future,</p>
<p>where they like to have competition</p>
<p>with other superpowers and almost conjure up superpowers,</p>
<p>even when those countries don&rsquo;t maybe at the time</p>
<p>at least deserve the label of superpower.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right, great point.</p>
<p>Yeah, they&rsquo;re all some points.</p>
<p>So yeah, I mean, Russia was, I think many, many exports.</p>
<p>I mean, my mentor at Princeton, Stephen Cotkin,</p>
<p>was then writing great things about how,</p>
<p>if you look at Russia&rsquo;s economy, the scale of its GDP,</p>
<p>its capacity to actually act globally,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all quite limited.</p>
<p>But Condoleezza Rice and the people around her</p>
<p>came into power with George W. Bush,</p>
<p>thinking that the foreign policy challenges of her era</p>
<p>would be those of the past, right?</p>
<p>Richard Clark and others within the administration</p>
<p>warned that, in fact, there is this group</p>
<p>that has declared war against the United States</p>
<p>and they are coming for us.</p>
<p>The FBI had been following these people around</p>
<p>for many months.</p>
<p>So by the time George W. Bush comes to power,</p>
<p>lots of Al Qaeda activists are, well, not lots,</p>
<p>but perhaps a dozen or so,</p>
<p>are already training in the United States, right?</p>
<p>And what we knew immediately from the biographies</p>
<p>of some of the characters of the attackers of 9.11,</p>
<p>it was a hodgepodge of people from across the planet,</p>
<p>but most of them were Saudi, right?</p>
<p>And that was known very early on</p>
<p>or presumed very early on.</p>
<p>So again, if we go back to your big question</p>
<p>about the geography, why Afghanistan?</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t add up, right?</p>
<p>It seemed to me that Afghanistan was a kind of soft target.</p>
<p>It was a place to have explosions,</p>
<p>to seemingly recapture American supremacy.</p>
<p>And also, I think, you know, there was,</p>
<p>in many quarters, there was a deep urge for revenge.</p>
<p>And this was a place to have some casualties,</p>
<p>have some explosions.</p>
<p>And then I think, you know, restore the legitimacy</p>
<p>of the Bush administration</p>
<p>by showing that we are in charge, we will pay.</p>
<p>And I think that was a very old fashioned punitive dimension,</p>
<p>which rests upon the presumption</p>
<p>that if we intimidate these people,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll know not to try us again, right?</p>
<p>All these, I would suggest, are all misreadings</p>
<p>of an organization that was always global.</p>
<p>It had no real center.</p>
<p>I mean, it called itself the center.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one way to translate Al Qaeda.</p>
<p>But that center was really in the imagination.</p>
<p>Bin Laden bounced around from country to country.</p>
<p>And crucially, I think a dimension</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t claim to know anything new about,</p>
<p>but has endured as a kind of doubt,</p>
<p>is the role of Saudi Arabia and the fact that, you know,</p>
<p>the muscle in that operation of 9 11 was Saudi, right?</p>
<p>I mean, this was a Saudi operation with,</p>
<p>if one thinks, again, just on the basis of nationalities,</p>
<p>Saudis, you know, an Egyptian or two, a Lebanese guy.</p>
<p>And the Egyptian guy, you know,</p>
<p>had been studying in Germany.</p>
<p>He was an urban planner, right?</p>
<p>So if one thinks of the imagination of this,</p>
<p>I mean, in fact, if you look at the kind of typology</p>
<p>of the figures who have led this radical movement,</p>
<p>I mean, if you think of the global jihadists,</p>
<p>they are mostly not religious scholars, right?</p>
<p>Bin Laden was not a religious scholar.</p>
<p>His training was an engineer.</p>
<p>You know, some biographers claim</p>
<p>that he was a playboy for much of his youth.</p>
<p>But really, these ideas,</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s probably why they chose the Twin Towers.</p>
<p>I mean, this is an imagination fueled</p>
<p>by training and engineering.</p>
<p>I mean, a lot of the, you know, the sociology,</p>
<p>if you do a kind of post biography</p>
<p>of a lot of these leading jihadists,</p>
<p>their backgrounds are not in Islamic scholarship,</p>
<p>but actually in engineering</p>
<p>and kind of practical sciences and professions.</p>
<p>Medical doctors are among their ranks.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s long been a tension between Islamic scholars</p>
<p>who devote their whole lives to study of texts</p>
<p>and commentary and interpretation.</p>
<p>And then what some scholars call kind of new intellectuals,</p>
<p>new Muslim authorities,</p>
<p>who actually have secular university educations,</p>
<p>often in the natural sciences</p>
<p>or engineering and technical fields,</p>
<p>who then bring that kind of mindset, if you will,</p>
<p>to what Muslim scholars called the religious sciences,</p>
<p>which are, you know, a field of kind of ambiguity</p>
<p>and of gradation and of subtlety and nuance,</p>
<p>and really of decades of training</p>
<p>before one becomes authoritative to speak about issues</p>
<p>like whether or not it&rsquo;s legitimate</p>
<p>to take someone else&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>With the relation to Afghanistan, who was bin Laden?</p>
<p>Bin Laden was a visitor.</p>
<p>If you look at his whole life course,</p>
<p>part of it is an enigma still.</p>
<p>You know, he is from a Saudi elite family,</p>
<p>but a family that kind of has a Yemeni Arabian sea</p>
<p>kind of genealogy.</p>
<p>So the family has no relationship to Afghanistan,</p>
<p>past or present, except at some point in 1980s,</p>
<p>when he went like thousands of other young Saudis,</p>
<p>first to Pakistan, to places like Bashour on the border,</p>
<p>where they wanted to aid the jihad in some capacity.</p>
<p>And for the most part, the Arabs who went</p>
<p>opened up hospitals, some opened up schools.</p>
<p>The bin Laden family had long been</p>
<p>based in engineering construction.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s thought that he used some of those skills</p>
<p>and resources and connections to build things.</p>
<p>We have images of him firing a gun for show, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not clear that he ever actually fired a gun</p>
<p>in what we would call combat.</p>
<p>Again, I could be corrected by this.</p>
<p>And I think there are competing accounts of who he was.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s kind of a, I mean, many of these figures</p>
<p>who sit at the pinnacle of this world are fictive heroes</p>
<p>that people map their aspirations onto, right?</p>
<p>And so people like Mullah Omar,</p>
<p>who was then head of the Taliban,</p>
<p>was rarely seen in public.</p>
<p>The current head of the Taliban</p>
<p>is almost never seen in public.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s a kind of studied era of mystery</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;ve cultivated to make themselves available</p>
<p>for all kinds of fantasies, right?</p>
<p>Do you think he believed, so his religious beliefs,</p>
<p>do you think he believed some of the more extreme things</p>
<p>that enable him to commit terrorist acts?</p>
<p>Maybe put another way,</p>
<p>what makes a man want to become a terrorist?</p>
<p>And what aspect of bin Laden made him want to be a terrorist?</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>I mean, let me offer some observations.</p>
<p>I think there are others who know more about bin Laden</p>
<p>and have far more expertise in Al Qaeda.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m coming at this in an adjacent way,</p>
<p>kind of from Afghanistan and from my historical training.</p>
<p>So this is my two cents, so bear with me.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have the authoritative account for this.</p>
<p>Which in itself is fascinating</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re a historian of Afghanistan,</p>
<p>and the fact that bin Laden isn&rsquo;t a huge part</p>
<p>of your focus of study just means</p>
<p>that bin Laden is not a key part of the history of Afghanistan</p>
<p>except that America made him a key part</p>
<p>of the history of Afghanistan.</p>
<p>I would endorse that.</p>
<p>Definitely, that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;ve put it in a very pithy, pithy way.</p>
<p>Yeah, so listen, so he was an engineer.</p>
<p>He was said to be a playboy</p>
<p>who spent a lot of cash from his family.</p>
<p>Like many young Saudis and from some other countries,</p>
<p>he was inspired by this idea</p>
<p>that there was jihad in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>It was gonna take down one of the two superpowers,</p>
<p>the Soviet Union,</p>
<p>who the Red Army did murder hundreds of thousands,</p>
<p>perhaps as many as 2 million Afghan civilians</p>
<p>during that conflict.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very plausible and very completely understandable</p>
<p>that many young people would see that cause</p>
<p>as the righteous, pious fighters for jihad</p>
<p>who call themselves mujahideen</p>
<p>are ready against this evil empire</p>
<p>of a godless Soviet empire that,</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s even confusion</p>
<p>about what the Soviets wanted.</p>
<p>Now we know much more about what the Kremlin wanted,</p>
<p>what Brezhnev wanted,</p>
<p>and how the Soviet elite thought about it</p>
<p>because we have many more of their records.</p>
<p>But from the outside, for Jimmy Carter and then for Reagan,</p>
<p>it looked like the Soviets were making a move on South Asia</p>
<p>because they wanted to get to the warm water ports,</p>
<p>which Russians always want supposedly, right?</p>
<p>And it was kind of a move to take over our oil</p>
<p>and to assert world domination, right?</p>
<p>So there are lots of ways in which this looked like</p>
<p>good versus evil in Congress.</p>
<p>It looked like kind of Vietnam again,</p>
<p>but this time this is our chance to get them.</p>
<p>And there are lots of great quotes,</p>
<p>I mean, disturbing, but really revealing quotes</p>
<p>that American policymakers made about</p>
<p>wanting to give the Soviets their Vietnam.</p>
<p>So the CIA funneled hundreds of millions of dollars</p>
<p>into this project to back the Mujahideen,</p>
<p>who Reagan called freedom fighters.</p>
<p>And so Bin Laden was part of that universe,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s part of that,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s swimming in the ocean of these Afghan Mujahideen</p>
<p>who out of size did 95% of the fighting,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re the ones who died,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re the ones who defeated the Red Army, right?</p>
<p>The Arabs who were there did a little fighting,</p>
<p>but a lot of it was for their purposes.</p>
<p>It was to get experience,</p>
<p>it was to kind of create their reputations</p>
<p>like Bin Laden began to force for himself</p>
<p>of being spoken for a global project.</p>
<p>Because by the late 80s,</p>
<p>when Bin Laden I think was more active</p>
<p>and began conspiring with people from other Arab countries,</p>
<p>the idea that Gorbachev came to power in 85,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like, let&rsquo;s get out of here,</p>
<p>this is draining the Soviet budget,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an embarrassment,</p>
<p>we didn&rsquo;t think about this properly,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s focus on restoring the party</p>
<p>and strengthening the Soviet Union,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s get out of this costly war,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a waste, it&rsquo;s not worth it,</p>
<p>where you don&rsquo;t lose anything</p>
<p>by getting out of Afghanistan.</p>
<p>And so their retreat was quite effective and successful</p>
<p>from the Soviet point of view, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not what we&rsquo;re seeing now.</p>
<p>What year was the retreat?</p>
<p>I mean, it began,</p>
<p>so Mikhail Gorbachev came to power in 1985,</p>
<p>he was a generation younger than the other guys,</p>
<p>he was a critic of the system,</p>
<p>he didn&rsquo;t want to abolish it,</p>
<p>he wanted to reform it,</p>
<p>he was a true believer in Soviet socialism</p>
<p>and in the party as a monopolist, right?</p>
<p>But he was critical of the old guard</p>
<p>and recognized that the party had to change</p>
<p>and the whole system had to change to continue to compete.</p>
<p>And so Afghanistan was one element of this.</p>
<p>And so he pushed the Afghan elites</p>
<p>that Moscow was backing to basically say,</p>
<p>listen, we&rsquo;re gonna share power.</p>
<p>And so a figure named Najibullah,</p>
<p>who was a Soviet trained intelligence specialist</p>
<p>sitting in Kabul agreed.</p>
<p>And he said, we need to have a more kind of</p>
<p>pluralistic accommodations approach to our enemies</p>
<p>who are backed by the US mainly,</p>
<p>sitting in Pakistan, sitting in Iran,</p>
<p>backed by these Arabs to a degree,</p>
<p>getting money from Saudi.</p>
<p>And he said, let&rsquo;s draw some of them into the government</p>
<p>and basically have a kind of unity government</p>
<p>that would make some space to the opposition.</p>
<p>And for the most part, with US backing,</p>
<p>with Pakistani backing, with Iranian backing</p>
<p>and with Saudi backing, the opposition said, no,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not going to reconcile,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna push you off the cliff.</p>
<p>And so that story goes on from at least 1987,</p>
<p>the last Soviet Red Army troops leave early 1989,</p>
<p>but the Najibullah government holds on for three more years.</p>
<p>It is the, I mean, they&rsquo;re still getting some help</p>
<p>from the Soviet Union,</p>
<p>its enemies are still getting help from the US mainly.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not till 1992 that they lose.</p>
<p>And then Mujahideen come to power,</p>
<p>they immediately, they&rsquo;re deeply fractured.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where bin Laden is watching all of this unroll.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s part of the mix, but he&rsquo;s also mobile.</p>
<p>So he at one point goes, is in Sudan.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s moving from place to place.</p>
<p>His people are all over the world.</p>
<p>In fact, they, I mean, if you think of the,</p>
<p>once the Mujahideen take power,</p>
<p>they have difficulties with Arab fighters too.</p>
<p>And they don&rsquo;t want them coming in and messing</p>
<p>with Mujahideen regarding this as like,</p>
<p>this is an Afghan national state that we&rsquo;re gonna build.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna be Islamic, it&rsquo;s gonna be an Islamic state,</p>
<p>but you can&rsquo;t interfere with us.</p>
<p>And so there are always tensions.</p>
<p>And so the Arabs are always kind of,</p>
<p>I would say they were Arab fighters were always interlopers.</p>
<p>Yes, the Afghans are happy to take their money,</p>
<p>send patients to their hospitals, take their weapons,</p>
<p>but they were never gonna let this be like a Saudi</p>
<p>or Egyptian or whatever project.</p>
<p>But then many of those fighters went home,</p>
<p>they went back to Syria, they went back to Egypt.</p>
<p>Some wanted to go back to the Saudi Arabia,</p>
<p>but the Saudis were very careful.</p>
<p>I mean, the Saudis always used Afghanistan</p>
<p>as a kind of safety valve.</p>
<p>In fact, they had fundraisers on television,</p>
<p>they chartered jets.</p>
<p>They filled them with people to fly to Pakistan,</p>
<p>get out in the shower and say, go fight.</p>
<p>And it was one way that the monarchy, the Saudi monarchy,</p>
<p>very cleverly I think, created a kind of escape valve</p>
<p>for would be dissidents in Saudi Arabia, right?</p>
<p>Just send them abroad.</p>
<p>You wanna fight Jihad, go do that somewhere else.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t bother the kingdom.</p>
<p>But all this became dicier in the early 90s</p>
<p>when some of these guys came back home</p>
<p>and some of the scholars around them said,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve defeated the Soviet Union, which is a huge, huge boost.</p>
<p>And I think part of the dynamic we see today</p>
<p>is that the Taliban victory is a renewed inspiration</p>
<p>for people who think, look, we beat the Soviets,</p>
<p>now we beat the Americans.</p>
<p>And so already watching the Soviet retreat</p>
<p>across this bridge, back into Uzbekistan,</p>
<p>if you see these dramatic images of the tanks moving,</p>
<p>a lot of people interpreted this as like,</p>
<p>we are going to change the world</p>
<p>and now we&rsquo;re training to the Americans.</p>
<p>And our local national governments</p>
<p>are backed by the Americans.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s start with those places</p>
<p>and then let&rsquo;s go strike the belly of the beast,</p>
<p>which is America, which is New York.</p>
<p>And going back to Bin Laden,</p>
<p>your question about what motivates him,</p>
<p>what motivated him, again,</p>
<p>he was not a rigorously trained Islamic scholar.</p>
<p>And that I think, when this comes up in our classes,</p>
<p>I think especially young people,</p>
<p>I mean, people who weren&rsquo;t even born on 9 11,</p>
<p>I mean, they&rsquo;re shocked, they see his appearance,</p>
<p>they see him pictured in front of a giant bookshelf</p>
<p>of Arabic books, he&rsquo;s got the Kalashnikov,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s got what looks like</p>
<p>a religious scholars library behind him, right?</p>
<p>But if you look at his words,</p>
<p>I mean, one fascinating thing about just our politics</p>
<p>and just one thing that kind of sums all this up,</p>
<p>I mean, the fact that on 9 11,</p>
<p>we had to have a few people, a few experts,</p>
<p>people like Burnett Rubin, who was an Afghanistan expert.</p>
<p>So that was one way in which I think,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not faulting him personally,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s just one way in which that relationship</p>
<p>appeared to be formed, right?</p>
<p>Of linking Afghanistan to that moment.</p>
<p>If one looks actually at what Bin Laden was saying and doing,</p>
<p>people like Richard Clarke were studying this,</p>
<p>there were Arab leaders, the Arab press was watching this</p>
<p>because he gave some of his first interviews</p>
<p>to a few Arab newspaper outlets.</p>
<p>But speaking of our American kind of monolingualism,</p>
<p>a lot of what he was saying wasn&rsquo;t known.</p>
<p>And so I think for several years,</p>
<p>people weren&rsquo;t reading what Bin Laden said.</p>
<p>I mean, experts are reading it in Arabic,</p>
<p>but there was great anxiety around translating his works.</p>
<p>So we have Mon conf, we have all this other stuff,</p>
<p>you can buy the collected works of Lenin, Stalin, Mao,</p>
<p>whatever you want in whatever language you want.</p>
<p>But Bin Laden was taboo for American publishing.</p>
<p>So it was only a Verso in the UK</p>
<p>that published a famous volume called</p>
<p>Messages to the World,</p>
<p>which was the first compendium of Bin Laden&rsquo;s writings.</p>
<p>So he has a Mein Kampf.</p>
<p>He has a type, does he have a thing?</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s a kind of collected works.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a collected works of his, yeah.</p>
<p>Well, like a blog, like a collection of articles versus.</p>
<p>Yeah, these are interviews, these are his missives,</p>
<p>his declarations, his decrees, right?</p>
<p>But I think just in terms of if we zoom out for a second</p>
<p>about American policy choices and so on,</p>
<p>the powers that be didn&rsquo;t trust us</p>
<p>to know what he was really about.</p>
<p>I put it that way.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t say that in a conspiratorial sense.</p>
<p>I just think that it was a taboo.</p>
<p>I think people, there was a kind of consensus</p>
<p>that trust us, we know how to fight Al Qaeda</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t need to know what they&rsquo;re about</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re crazy.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re fanatics, they&rsquo;re fundamentalists.</p>
<p>They hate us, remember that language, us versus them.</p>
<p>But if you read Bin Laden, that&rsquo;s when it gets messy.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where the Bin Laden&rsquo;s argumentation</p>
<p>is not fundamentally about Islam.</p>
<p>And if you were sitting here with an Islamic scholar,</p>
<p>he would say, depending on which Islamic scholar,</p>
<p>they would tend to go through and dissect</p>
<p>and negate 99% of the arguments</p>
<p>that Bin Laden claimed was in Islam, right?</p>
<p>But what strikes me as an historian who&rsquo;s again,</p>
<p>looking at this adjacently, if you read Bin Laden,</p>
<p>I mean, the arguments that he make are,</p>
<p>first of all, they&rsquo;re sophisticated.</p>
<p>They reflect a mind that is about geopolitics.</p>
<p>He uses terms like imperialism.</p>
<p>He knows something about world history.</p>
<p>He knows something about geography.</p>
<p>So imperialism is the enemy for him</p>
<p>or what&rsquo;s the nature of the enemy?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an amalgam and like a good politician,</p>
<p>which is what I would call him,</p>
<p>he is adept at speaking in different ways</p>
<p>to different audiences.</p>
<p>So if you look at the context in which he speaks,</p>
<p>if you look at messages to the world,</p>
<p>if you look at his writings and you can zoom out now</p>
<p>and we now have compendia of the writings</p>
<p>of Al Qaeda more broadly, you can purchase these,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re basically primary source collections.</p>
<p>We now have that for the Taliban.</p>
<p>I mean, what&rsquo;s fascinating about,</p>
<p>I think if you&rsquo;d like this culture,</p>
<p>acknowledging it&rsquo;s very diverse internally</p>
<p>is that these people are representatives</p>
<p>of political movements who seek followers.</p>
<p>They speak, they often are very,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say skilled at visual imagery.</p>
<p>And especially now, I mean, what&rsquo;s fascinating is that,</p>
<p>I mean, the Taliban used to shoot televisions.</p>
<p>They used to blow up VCR, videotapes.</p>
<p>They used to string audio and video cassettes</p>
<p>from trees and kind of ceremonial hangings, right?</p>
<p>That we&rsquo;re killing this nefarious, infidel technology</p>
<p>that is doing the work of Satan.</p>
<p>And yet today, and plus, I mean,</p>
<p>one of the keys to the Taliban success</p>
<p>is that they got really good at using media.</p>
<p>I mean, brilliant at using the written word,</p>
<p>the spoken word, music, actually.</p>
<p>And Hollywood, Hollywood is the gold standard.</p>
<p>And these guys have studied how to create drama,</p>
<p>how to speak to modern users.</p>
<p>I mean, Islamic State did this.</p>
<p>I mean, the role of media, new media.</p>
<p>I mean, I follow and I am followed by</p>
<p>senior Taliban leaders, which is bizarre on Twitter.</p>
<p>On Twitter?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why they care about me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m nothing.</p>
<p>They follow you on Twitter.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why.</p>
<p>This is no joke.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re part of our modern world</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s how they talk and it&rsquo;s how they recruit.</p>
<p>And this is part of the, this is why they are.</p>
<p>So Ben Laden, if you read Ben Laden,</p>
<p>he speaks multiple languages, I would say.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s environmentalism.</p>
<p>The West is bad because we destroyed the planet.</p>
<p>The West is bad because we abuse women.</p>
<p>So in class, especially female students</p>
<p>are very surprised to learn</p>
<p>and actually say this feminist argument is not,</p>
<p>we start with, this is a murder.</p>
<p>This is a person who has taken human life,</p>
<p>innocent life over and over again.</p>
<p>And he is aspirationally genocidal,</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s try to understand what he&rsquo;s about.</p>
<p>So we walk through the texts, read them</p>
<p>and people are shocked to learn that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not just about quotations in the Quran</p>
<p>strung together in some irrational fashion.</p>
<p>He knows, I mean, at the core,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say is the problem of human suffering.</p>
<p>And he has a geography of that, that is mostly Muslim,</p>
<p>but he talked about the suffering of Kashmir, right?</p>
<p>So if you have a student in your class,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s from South Asia, who knows about Kashmir,</p>
<p>he or she will say, that&rsquo;s not entirely inaccurate.</p>
<p>The Indian state commits atrocities in Kashmir.</p>
<p>Pakistan is doing that too.</p>
<p>Palestine is an issue, right?</p>
<p>So you have in the American university setting,</p>
<p>people across the spectrum who get that,</p>
<p>Palestinians have had a raw deal.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s a, victimhood is central</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s Muslim victimhood, which is primary,</p>
<p>but as a number of scholars have written,</p>
<p>and I definitely think this is a framework</p>
<p>for what this is useful.</p>
<p>I mean, in this kind of vocabulary,</p>
<p>in this framing, this narrative,</p>
<p>today, in today&rsquo;s world,</p>
<p>if we think of today&rsquo;s world being post Cold War,</p>
<p>91 to the present, looking at the series of Gulf Wars</p>
<p>and seeing the visuals of that,</p>
<p>I think that the American public</p>
<p>has been shielded from some of this,</p>
<p>but if you look at just the carnage of the Iraqi army</p>
<p>that George H.W. Bush produced, right?</p>
<p>Or you think of the images of the suffering</p>
<p>of Iraqi children under George H.W. Bush&rsquo;s sanctions,</p>
<p>US British airstrikes,</p>
<p>then you have Madeleine Albright answer a question</p>
<p>on 16 Minutes saying,</p>
<p>do you think the deaths of half a million Iraqi kids</p>
<p>is worth it?</p>
<p>Is that justified to contain Saddam Hussein?</p>
<p>And she says on camera, yes, it&rsquo;s worth it to me.</p>
<p>If you put that all together,</p>
<p>I mean, American kids, and of course the American public,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not always aware of those facts of global history,</p>
<p>but these guys are,</p>
<p>and they very capably use these images, use these tropes,</p>
<p>and use facts.</p>
<p>I mean, some of these things are not deniable.</p>
<p>I mean, these estimates about the number</p>
<p>of Iraqi civilian children dead,</p>
<p>that came from, I think, the Lancet,</p>
<p>and it came from, those are estimates,</p>
<p>but looking at this from the point of view of Amman,</p>
<p>of Jaffa, of Nairobi,</p>
<p>you can just think around the planet,</p>
<p>and if you see yourself as the victim</p>
<p>of this great imperial power,</p>
<p>you can see why especially young men</p>
<p>would be drawn to a road of self sacrifice.</p>
<p>And the idea is that in killing others,</p>
<p>you are making them feel how you feel,</p>
<p>because they won&rsquo;t listen to your arguments reasonably,</p>
<p>because they won&rsquo;t recognize Palestinian suffering,</p>
<p>Bosnian suffering, right?</p>
<p>Chechen suffering.</p>
<p>You go across the planet, right?</p>
<p>Because they won&rsquo;t recognize our suffering,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna speak to you in the only language</p>
<p>that you understand, and that&rsquo;s violence.</p>
<p>And look at the violence of the post 1991 world, right?</p>
<p>In which American air power really becomes a global,</p>
<p>you know, kind of fact in the lives of so many people.</p>
<p>And then the big mistake after 9 11 among many,</p>
<p>I mean, fundamentally was taking the war on terror</p>
<p>to some 30 or 40 countries, right?</p>
<p>So that you have more and more of the globe</p>
<p>feel like they&rsquo;re under attack, right?</p>
<p>And the logic is essentially, it&rsquo;s really bin Laden,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not we&rsquo;re going to convert you</p>
<p>and turn you into Muslims and that&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re doing this.</p>
<p>That appears, that claim does appear at times.</p>
<p>But if you look at any given bin Laden text,</p>
<p>I mean, there are 40 claims in each text.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s kind of, it&rsquo;s dizzying,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s a modern politician,</p>
<p>he knows the language of social equality,</p>
<p>you know, there&rsquo;s a class dimension to it,</p>
<p>there is an environmental dimension to it,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a gender dimension to it.</p>
<p>And yes, there are chronic quotes sprinkled in.</p>
<p>And when he wants to speak that language,</p>
<p>he knew that, you know, he&rsquo;s not a scholar.</p>
<p>So he would often get a few recognized scholars to sign on.</p>
<p>So some of his decorations of Jihad</p>
<p>had his signature kind of sprinkled in</p>
<p>with like a dozen other signatures</p>
<p>from people who are somewhat known</p>
<p>or at least with titles, right?</p>
<p>So as a kind of intellectual exercise,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s fascinating to see</p>
<p>that he is throwing everything at the wall in one level.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one way to see that it&rsquo;s a,</p>
<p>these are kind of testaments toward recruitment</p>
<p>of people who, yes, they&rsquo;re angry, yes, they&rsquo;re unhappy.</p>
<p>And this is what, you know,</p>
<p>I think for a broader public, it&rsquo;s hard to get,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re like, well, bin Laden didn&rsquo;t suffer, he wasn&rsquo;t poor.</p>
<p>Like, yeah, I mean, Lenin, Pol Pot, I mean.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re speaking to, they&rsquo;re empathetic</p>
<p>to the suffering, the landscape,</p>
<p>the full landscape of suffering.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting to think about suffering,</p>
<p>you know, America, the American public,</p>
<p>American politicians and leaders,</p>
<p>when they see what is good and evil,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re often not empathetic to the suffering of others.</p>
<p>And what you&rsquo;re saying is bin Laden perhaps accurately</p>
<p>could speak to the ignorance of America,</p>
<p>maybe the Soviet Union, to the suffering of their people.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>And I mean, if you look at the speeches</p>
<p>and the ideas that are public of Hitler in the 1930s,</p>
<p>he spoke quite accurately to the injustice</p>
<p>and maybe the suffering of the German people.</p>
<p>I mean, charismatic politicians</p>
<p>are good at telling accurate stories.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not all fabricated,</p>
<p>but they emphasize certain aspects.</p>
<p>And then the problem part is the actions</p>
<p>you should take based on that.</p>
<p>So the narratives and the stories</p>
<p>may be grounded in historical accuracy.</p>
<p>The actions then cross the line, the ethical line.</p>
<p>I found that too, I mean, it&rsquo;s a,</p>
<p>again, if you pick up just one of these texts,</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s a kaleidoscope.</p>
<p>So the Hitler analogy is interesting</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s Hitler spoke to,</p>
<p>he could speak to things like inflation, right?</p>
<p>Which really existed.</p>
<p>But he also appealed to the irrational emotions of Germans.</p>
<p>He sought out scapegoats, Jews, Roma, disabled people,</p>
<p>homosexuals and so on, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s also there in bin Laden too.</p>
<p>I mean, the idea of an anti semitism,</p>
<p>the constant flagging of Zionists and crusaders,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a kind of shotgun approach to a search for followers.</p>
<p>But I also hasten to add that it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>for all of the things that we could take off saying,</p>
<p>well, yes, Kashmiris have suffered,</p>
<p>Chechens have suffered and so on.</p>
<p>Bin Ladenism never became a mass movement.</p>
<p>I mean, it never really, I think the,</p>
<p>I mean, this is the encouraging thing, right?</p>
<p>About ideology.</p>
<p>I mean, I think the blood on his hands</p>
<p>always limited his appeal among Muslims and others.</p>
<p>But Bin Laden did have, I mean, he had a,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a great book by a great scholar</p>
<p>at UC San Diego, Jeremy Prestholt,</p>
<p>who read a great book about global icons</p>
<p>in which he has Bin Laden, he has Bob Marley,</p>
<p>he has Tupac, you know, he asked why,</p>
<p>you know, he&rsquo;s doing research in East Africa,</p>
<p>why did he see young kids wearing Bin Laden shirts?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re also wearing like Tupac shirts.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re wearing Bob Marley shirts.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a way of looking at a kind of partial embrace</p>
<p>of some aspects of the rebelliousness</p>
<p>of some of these figures, some of the time,</p>
<p>by some people under certain conditions.</p>
<p>Well, the terrifying thing to me,</p>
<p>so yeah, there is a longing in the human heart</p>
<p>to belong to a group and a charismatic leader somehow,</p>
<p>especially when you&rsquo;re young,</p>
<p>just a catalyst for all of that.</p>
<p>I tend to think that perhaps it&rsquo;s actually hard</p>
<p>to be Hitler, so a leader so charismatic</p>
<p>that he can rally a nation to war.</p>
<p>And Bin Laden, perhaps we&rsquo;re lucky,</p>
<p>was not sufficiently charismatic.</p>
<p>I feel like if his writing was better,</p>
<p>if his speeches were better,</p>
<p>if his ideas were stronger,</p>
<p>better, it&rsquo;s like more viral,</p>
<p>and then there would be more people,</p>
<p>kind of young people uniting around him.</p>
<p>So in some sense, it&rsquo;s almost like accidents of history</p>
<p>of just how much charisma,</p>
<p>how much charisma a particular evil person has,</p>
<p>a person like Bin Laden.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s fair, evil works, I think.</p>
<p>So you think Bin Laden is evil?</p>
<p>Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, he was a mass murderer.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just saying that his ideas were,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re more complex than we&rsquo;ve tended to acknowledge.</p>
<p>They have a wider potential resonance</p>
<p>than we would acknowledge.</p>
<p>I mean, and also, I guess what I&rsquo;m,</p>
<p>just one fundamental point is that</p>
<p>thinking about the complexity of Bin Laden</p>
<p>is also a way of removing him from Islam.</p>
<p>He is not an Islamic thinker.</p>
<p>He is a cosmopolitan thinker</p>
<p>who plays in all kinds of modern ideologies,</p>
<p>which have proven to mobilize people in the past, right?</p>
<p>So antisemitism, populism, environmentalism,</p>
<p>and the urging to do something about humanity,</p>
<p>do something about suffering.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I think the actual,</p>
<p>you asked about what motivates people</p>
<p>to do this kind of stuff.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s why if one goes below the level of leadership,</p>
<p>and this is being reported,</p>
<p>if you look at the trial ongoing now in Paris</p>
<p>of the Bataclan murders, I think,</p>
<p>the court allowed some discussion</p>
<p>of the backgrounds of the accused,</p>
<p>and they come from different backgrounds,</p>
<p>but if there&rsquo;s any common bond,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of that they had some background in petty crime.</p>
<p>Famously, in the 7.7 bombings in London,</p>
<p>the Metropolitan Police, UK authorities</p>
<p>looked at all those guys,</p>
<p>and what people want is this idea</p>
<p>that they must be very pious.</p>
<p>They must be super Islamic to do this kind of stuff.</p>
<p>They must be fanatical true believers,</p>
<p>but what they found with those guys</p>
<p>was that some were nominally Muslim,</p>
<p>some went to mosques, some didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Some were single, young guys with criminal backgrounds.</p>
<p>Some were like, sorry, they were kind of misfits</p>
<p>who never succeeded in anything.</p>
<p>But others had at least one thing,</p>
<p>had a wife and family who he widowed and orphaned.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s no, I mean, for policing,</p>
<p>I mean, if you&rsquo;re looking at it through that lens,</p>
<p>there is no kind of typology</p>
<p>that will predict who will become violent.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why I think we have to move beyond</p>
<p>thinking about religious augmentation narrowly or by itself</p>
<p>and think about things like geopolitics,</p>
<p>think about how people respond to inequality,</p>
<p>the existential threat of climate crisis,</p>
<p>of a whole host of matters,</p>
<p>and think about this is a mode of political contestation.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s a violent one, it&rsquo;s one I condemn.</p>
<p>It is evil, right?</p>
<p>But these are people that are trying to be political.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re trying to change things in some way.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not narrowly about like,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, impose Sharia law on you.</p>
<p>You must wear a veil.</p>
<p>You must eat this kind of food.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that parochial.</p>
<p>But another quick thought</p>
<p>about your interesting claim about charisma in this,</p>
<p>I think that the one self limiting feature</p>
<p>of this subculture is that definitely,</p>
<p>I mentioned the enigma of not wanting to be seen</p>
<p>and that the kind of invisibility</p>
<p>is a productive force of a power,</p>
<p>which a colleague of mine</p>
<p>who knows ancient history far better than I,</p>
<p>said that this is, when she looked at Milo Omar initially,</p>
<p>or we talk about Bin Laden,</p>
<p>I mean, this kind of studied posture</p>
<p>of staying in the shadows</p>
<p>is also a source of authority potentially,</p>
<p>because it invites the idea,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s partly dictatorships do as well.</p>
<p>I mean, it invites the idea that someone&rsquo;s working,</p>
<p>and maybe it&rsquo;s the basis for a lot of QAnon</p>
<p>or other conspiracy today,</p>
<p>that someone&rsquo;s working behind the scenes</p>
<p>and things are gonna go the right way.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t see it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s almost preferable because you can kind of feel it.</p>
<p>And so not having someone out front</p>
<p>can be maybe more effective</p>
<p>than having someone out in front constantly.</p>
<p>Then the whole&hellip;</p>
<p>Maybe, maybe.</p>
<p>And then the whole Bin Laden,</p>
<p>you know, Milo Omar thing, like you can&rsquo;t see me,</p>
<p>or if you look at Bin Laden&rsquo;s photographs</p>
<p>and his video stuff, I mean, he&rsquo;s coy.</p>
<p>Some observers have noted that he&rsquo;s kind of effeminate.</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t strike this kind of masculine,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s not a Mussolini, he&rsquo;s not a Hitler,</p>
<p>macho, upstanding, thumping my chest.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not doing the theatrical chin, you know?</p>
<p>The theater people tell us he&rsquo;s so aggressive, you know?</p>
<p>Oh, a chin?</p>
<p>What, bringing your chin up?</p>
<p>I saw a great BBC theater person.</p>
<p>It was kind of a&hellip;</p>
<p>It was a makeover show about how to become a better&hellip;</p>
<p>A dictator?</p>
<p>Oh, no.</p>
<p>Just a powerful, yeah, leader, authoritarian figure.</p>
<p>No, just how to get ahead in life.</p>
<p>And then&hellip;</p>
<p>Oh, okay, cool.</p>
<p>And just about acting, how you can act differently, right?</p>
<p>So it was a BBC thing.</p>
<p>And this woman claimed that, you know,</p>
<p>sticking your chin out, like a wrestler does, right,</p>
<p>is the most, like, male to male.</p>
<p>I love this kind of hilarious analysis</p>
<p>that people have about power.</p>
<p>But watch the chin, watch the chin.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same as analyzing, like,</p>
<p>in wrestling styles that win or fighting or so on.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so many ways to do it.</p>
<p>Well, the chin, I mean, the chin is a&hellip;</p>
<p>Could be interesting verbal gesture.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve watched enough Mussolini footage from my classes</p>
<p>to try to pick the right moment.</p>
<p>And the chin is&hellip;</p>
<p>Mussolini is all about the chin, so&hellip;</p>
<p>And I have watched human beings and human nature enough</p>
<p>to know that there&rsquo;s more to a man,</p>
<p>a powerful man, than a chin.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, no, no.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m saying it&rsquo;s an act of aggression.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying it&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of the many tools in the toolkit.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, sure.</p>
<p>So she definitely&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not all about the chin, but it&rsquo;s a&hellip;</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m trying to tell you about Ben Laden.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think he was deliberate enough</p>
<p>with the way he presents himself.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m saying about Ben Laden</p>
<p>that makes him different from these other characters is that</p>
<p>because he played at being the scholar,</p>
<p>he played at being a figure of modesty and humility.</p>
<p>And that meant that he was often&hellip;</p>
<p>Again, if you watch his visuals,</p>
<p>I mean, yes, there&rsquo;s one video of him firing a gun,</p>
<p>but if you watch how he moved,</p>
<p>how he wouldn&rsquo;t look at people directly,</p>
<p>how his face was almost&hellip;</p>
<p>I mean, he appears to be incredibly shy.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not spoken.</p>
<p>His voice was low.</p>
<p>He attempted to be poetic, right?</p>
<p>So it wasn&rsquo;t a warrior kind of image</p>
<p>that he tried to project of like a tough guy.</p>
<p>It was, I&rsquo;m demure, I&rsquo;m humble.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m offering you this message.</p>
<p>And the appeal that he was going for was to see&hellip;</p>
<p>To project himself as a scholar,</p>
<p>his knowledge and humility, the whole package,</p>
<p>carried with it an authenticity and a valor</p>
<p>that would animate, inspire people</p>
<p>to commit acts of violence, right?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a different kind of logic of like go and kill.</p>
<p>So he presented himself in contrast</p>
<p>to the imperialist kind of macho power, superpowers.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s just yet another way of&hellip;</p>
<p>And you have to have facial hair or hair</p>
<p>of different kinds that&rsquo;s recognized.</p>
<p>We had a very recognizable look too,</p>
<p>or at least later in life.</p>
<p>So&hellip;</p>
<p>Yeah, no, he tried to look the part.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m saying we&rsquo;re fortunate</p>
<p>that whatever calculation that he was making,</p>
<p>he was not more effective.</p>
<p>I mean, the world is full of terrorist organizations</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re fortunate to the degree any one of them</p>
<p>does not have an incredibly charismatic leader</p>
<p>that attains the kind of power that&rsquo;s very difficult</p>
<p>to manage at the geopolitical level.</p>
<p>Yeah, and we credit the publics,</p>
<p>who don&rsquo;t buy into that, right?</p>
<p>Who see through this.</p>
<p>We credit the critics, you know?</p>
<p>Early on, Kermadev 9.11 itself,</p>
<p>one of the problems was that US government officials</p>
<p>kept kind of leaning on Muslims to condemn this</p>
<p>as if all Muslims shared some collective responsibility</p>
<p>or culpability.</p>
<p>And in fact,</p>
<p>dozens of scholars and organizations,</p>
<p>hundreds condemned this,</p>
<p>but their condemnations never quite made it out.</p>
<p>But it created a tension where, you know,</p>
<p>if you wore a veil, you must&rsquo;ve been one of them</p>
<p>and you must be on Team Bin Laden.</p>
<p>And so a lot of the, you know,</p>
<p>I think a lot of the popular violence and discrimination</p>
<p>and profiling came out of that urge</p>
<p>to see a oneness, which, you know,</p>
<p>Bin Laden projected, right?</p>
<p>He wanted to say, we are one community.</p>
<p>You know, if you are a Muslim, you must be with me, right?</p>
<p>But I think that&rsquo;s where the diversity</p>
<p>of Muslim communities became important</p>
<p>because outside of small pockets,</p>
<p>I mean, they didn&rsquo;t accept his leadership, right?</p>
<p>People wore T shirts in some countries.</p>
<p>I mean, non Muslims wore T shirts</p>
<p>because he was like, he stuck it to the Americans.</p>
<p>So in Latin America, people are like,</p>
<p>yeah, that was sad, but, you know, finally,</p>
<p>I mean, there was a kind of schadenfreude</p>
<p>in that moment internationally.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like Che Guevara or somebody like that.</p>
<p>Yeah, Che&rsquo;s the other character in Prasad&rsquo;s book.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, that&rsquo;s right, that&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a symbol.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not exactly what he believed</p>
<p>or the cruelty of actions he took.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more like he stood for an idea</p>
<p>of revolution versus authority.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a great way to understand Bin Ladenism</p>
<p>and the whole phenomenon,</p>
<p>but I think looking at the big picture,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s also, you wonder, will that ever end, right?</p>
<p>I mean, is that, I mean, that&rsquo;s the risk</p>
<p>of being a kind of hyper power like the U.S.</p>
<p>where you, in assisting on a kind of unipolar world</p>
<p>in 2001, 2002, 2003, I think that created</p>
<p>an almost irresistible target, you know,</p>
<p>wherever the U.S. wanted to exert itself militarily.</p>
<p>Before we go to the history of Afghanistan,</p>
<p>the people, and I just want to talk to you</p>
<p>about just some fascinating aspect of the culture.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go to the end.</p>
<p>Withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts on how that was executed?</p>
<p>How could it have been done better?</p>
<p>Yeah, an important question.</p>
<p>I mean, I would preface all this by saying,</p>
<p>you know, as I noted, I think the war was a mistake.</p>
<p>I had hoped the war would end sooner.</p>
<p>I think there were different exit routes all along the way.</p>
<p>Again, I think there were lots of policy choices</p>
<p>in September and October when the war began.</p>
<p>There were choices in December 2001.</p>
<p>So we could look at almost every six month stopping point</p>
<p>and say, we could have done differently.</p>
<p>As it turns out though, I mean, the way it played out,</p>
<p>you know, it&rsquo;s been catastrophic.</p>
<p>And I think the Biden administration</p>
<p>has remained unaccountable for the scale</p>
<p>of the strategic and humanitarian and ethical failure</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re responsible for.</p>
<p>Well, okay, let&rsquo;s lay out the full,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s George W. Bush, there&rsquo;s Barack Obama,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s Donald Trump, there&rsquo;s Biden.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re all driving this van and there&rsquo;s these exits</p>
<p>and they keep not taking the exits</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re running out of gas.</p>
<p>I do this all the time thinking, where am I gonna pull off?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll go till it&rsquo;s empty.</p>
<p>How could it have been done better?</p>
<p>And what exactly, how much suffering</p>
<p>have all the decisions along the way caused?</p>
<p>What are the longterm consequences?</p>
<p>What are the biggest things that concern you</p>
<p>about the decisions we&rsquo;ve made in both invading Afghanistan</p>
<p>and staying in Afghanistan as long as we have?</p>
<p>I mean, if we start at the end, as you proposed,</p>
<p>you know, the horrific scenes of the airport,</p>
<p>you know, that was just one dimension.</p>
<p>I think in the weeks to come,</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;re gonna see Afghanistan implode.</p>
<p>There are lots of signs that malnutrition,</p>
<p>hunger, starvation are going to claim tens of thousands,</p>
<p>maybe hundreds of thousands of lives this winter.</p>
<p>And I think there is really nothing,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no framework in place to forestall that.</p>
<p>What is the government, what is currently the system there?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the role of the Taliban?</p>
<p>So there could be tens of thousands,</p>
<p>hundreds of thousands that starve,</p>
<p>either just almost to famine or starve to death.</p>
<p>So this is economic implosion, this is political implosion.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the system there like</p>
<p>and what could be the one, you know, some inkling of hope?</p>
<p>Right, right.</p>
<p>The Taliban sit in control, that&rsquo;s unique.</p>
<p>When they were in power in the 1990s from 1996, 2001,</p>
<p>they controlled some 85 to 90% of the country.</p>
<p>Now they own it all, but they have no budget.</p>
<p>The Afghan banking system is frozen.</p>
<p>So the financial system is a mess.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s frozen by the U.S.</p>
<p>because the U.S. is trying to use that lever</p>
<p>to exert pressure on the Taliban.</p>
<p>And so the ethical quandaries are of course legion, right?</p>
<p>Do you release that money to allow the Taliban</p>
<p>to shore up their rule, right?</p>
<p>The Biden administration has said no,</p>
<p>but the banks aren&rsquo;t working.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re in California, you wanna send $100 to your cousin</p>
<p>so she can buy bread, you can&rsquo;t do that now.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost impossible.</p>
<p>There are some informal networks,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re removing some stuff, but there are bread lines.</p>
<p>The Taliban government is incapable,</p>
<p>fundamentally just of ruling.</p>
<p>I mean, they can discipline people on the street,</p>
<p>they can force people into the mosque,</p>
<p>they can shoot people, they can beat protesters,</p>
<p>they can put out a newspaper,</p>
<p>they can have, they&rsquo;re great at diplomacy it turns out,</p>
<p>they can&rsquo;t rule this country.</p>
<p>So essentially the hospitals</p>
<p>and the kind of healthcare infrastructure</p>
<p>is being managed by NGOs that are international.</p>
<p>But most people had to leave</p>
<p>and the Taliban have impeded some of that work.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve told adult women essentially to stay home, right?</p>
<p>So a big part of the workforce isn&rsquo;t there.</p>
<p>So the supply chain is kind of crawling to a halt.</p>
<p>Trade with Pakistan and its neighbors,</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s kind of a transit trade economy.</p>
<p>It exports fruits.</p>
<p>Pakistan has been closing the border</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re anxious about refugees.</p>
<p>They want to exert pressure on the international community</p>
<p>to recognize the Taliban</p>
<p>because the Pakistan want the Taliban to succeed in power</p>
<p>because they see that in Pakistan&rsquo;s national interest,</p>
<p>especially through the lens of its rivalry with India.</p>
<p>So the Pakistani security institutions</p>
<p>are playing a double game.</p>
<p>Essentially Afghan people are being held hostage.</p>
<p>And so the Taliban are also saying,</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t recognize us,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna let tens of millions of Afghans starve.</p>
<p>So to which degree is Taliban,</p>
<p>like who are the Taliban?</p>
<p>What do they stand for?</p>
<p>What do they want?</p>
<p>Obviously year by year, this changes.</p>
<p>So what is the nature of this organization?</p>
<p>Can they be a legitimate, peaceful, kind, respectful</p>
<p>government sort of holder of power</p>
<p>or are they fundamentally not capable of doing so?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, the briefest answer would be</p>
<p>that they are a clerical slash military organization.</p>
<p>They have, this is kind of a imperfect metaphor,</p>
<p>but years ago, a German scholar used the term caravan</p>
<p>to describe them.</p>
<p>And that has some attractive elements</p>
<p>because different people have joined the Taliban</p>
<p>for different purposes at different times,</p>
<p>but today, and people tell us,</p>
<p>scholars who know more about the women than I have said,</p>
<p>listen, the Taliban is this kind of hodgepodge</p>
<p>of different actors and people and competing interests.</p>
<p>And I think, so we have a lot of scholars who said,</p>
<p>listen, it&rsquo;s polycentric.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s got people in this city and that city and so on.</p>
<p>I think actually, I was always very skeptical.</p>
<p>How do they know this?</p>
<p>I mean, this is an organization that doesn&rsquo;t want you</p>
<p>to know where that money comes from and so on.</p>
<p>But I would say now that we have a clear picture</p>
<p>of what has happened,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say they are a astoundingly well organized</p>
<p>clerical military organization that has a very cohesive</p>
<p>and enduring ideology, which is quite idiosyncratic.</p>
<p>If we zoom out and continue the conversation</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re having about Islam and how we think about radicalism</p>
<p>and who&rsquo;s drawn to what,</p>
<p>people throw different terms around to describe the Taliban.</p>
<p>Some use a term that links it to a kind of school of thought</p>
<p>born in the 19th century in India, the Doabandi school.</p>
<p>But if you look at their teachings,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very clear now I think that these labels,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like saying, you&rsquo;re an MIT guy.</p>
<p>Well, what does that mean?</p>
<p>I mean, MIT is home to dozens of different potentially</p>
<p>kinds of intellectual orientations, right?</p>
<p>I mean, attaching the name of the school</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t quite capture, I mean, university.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s complicated.</p>
<p>I mean, actually MIT is interesting</p>
<p>because I would say MIT is different</p>
<p>than Stanford, for example.</p>
<p>I think MIT has a more kind of narrow.</p>
<p>Yeah, I hear you.</p>
<p>Bad analogy on my part, maybe.</p>
<p>Well, no, it&rsquo;s interesting because I would argue</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s some aspect of a brand like Taliban or MIT,</p>
<p>no relation, that has a kind of interact,</p>
<p>like the brand results in the behavior of the,</p>
<p>like enforces a kind of behavior on the people</p>
<p>and the people feed the brand and like there&rsquo;s a loop.</p>
<p>I think Stanford is a good example</p>
<p>of something that&rsquo;s more distributed.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s sufficient amount of diversity</p>
<p>in like all kinds of like centers</p>
<p>and all that kind of stuff that the brand</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t become one thing.</p>
<p>MIT is so engineering.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so different than that.</p>
<p>Okay, scratch MIT, scratch Stanford too</p>
<p>because I think Stanford&rsquo;s more like MIT</p>
<p>than you might imagine, but isn&rsquo;t Taliban,</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t it pretty, I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s a diversity.</p>
<p>So yeah, sorry, so just to rephrase.</p>
<p>So people say, oh, the Deobandi school.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, what is that?</p>
<p>I mean, but the Taliban are, they&rsquo;re an ethnic movement.</p>
<p>They represent a vision of Pashtun power, right?</p>
<p>Pashtuns are people who are quite internally diverse,</p>
<p>who actually speak multiple dialects of Pashto,</p>
<p>who reside across the frontier of Pakistan and Afghanistan.</p>
<p>There are Pashtuns who live all over the planet, right?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a community in Moscow, California, everywhere,</p>
<p>right, so it&rsquo;s a global diaspora of sorts.</p>
<p>Pashtuns have a kind of genealogical imagination</p>
<p>so that lots of Pashtuns can tell you</p>
<p>the names of their grandparents, great grandparents</p>
<p>and so on, and that&rsquo;s kind of a,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a sense of pride in that.</p>
<p>Pashto language is a kind of core element of that identity,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not universal.</p>
<p>So for example, you can meet people who say,</p>
<p>I am Pashtun, but I don&rsquo;t know Pashto.</p>
<p>So as you claw away at this idea, it&rsquo;s amorphous.</p>
<p>It also means different things,</p>
<p>different people at different times.</p>
<p>So saying the Taliban are Pashtun</p>
<p>requires lots of qualifiers</p>
<p>because lots of Pashtuns will say,</p>
<p>no, no, I have nothing to the Taliban.</p>
<p>I hate those people.</p>
<p>So the Taliban tried to mobilize other Pashtuns</p>
<p>with limited success,</p>
<p>but their core membership is almost exclusively Pashtun.</p>
<p>And they say, no, no, we represent Afghans.</p>
<p>We represent pious Muslims.</p>
<p>And so in recent two, three years,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve gone further to say, no, we have other groups.</p>
<p>We have Uzbeks, we have Tajiks, we have Hazaras.</p>
<p>And in the North of Afghanistan, in recent years,</p>
<p>they did do a bit better at drawing in people</p>
<p>who were very disaffected because of the government.</p>
<p>And they were able to diversify their ranks somewhat.</p>
<p>But if you want to say August 15 and who they&rsquo;ve appointed,</p>
<p>what language they&rsquo;ve used,</p>
<p>how they&rsquo;ve presented themselves,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s clear that they are Pashtun, they are male,</p>
<p>and they are extremely ideologically cohesive</p>
<p>and disciplined, I&rsquo;d say, right?</p>
<p>So I think that a lot of the polycentrism, blah, blah,</p>
<p>some of that stuff was a way to fight a war.</p>
<p>They are fundamentally a guerrilla movement.</p>
<p>They see themselves as kind of pious Robin Hoods.</p>
<p>The rhetoric is very much about taking from the rich,</p>
<p>taking from the privileged, giving to the poor,</p>
<p>being on the side of the underdog, fighting against evil.</p>
<p>And so, I mean, their bag, if you like, their thing,</p>
<p>their central theme, their brand is about public morality.</p>
<p>And so their origin story, going back to 1994,</p>
<p>is that they interceded, they broke up a gang of criminals</p>
<p>who were trying to rape people.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s a very interesting emphasis on sexuality</p>
<p>and on public morality and really being the core</p>
<p>of we&rsquo;re gonna restore order and public morality.</p>
<p>And how that translates into governance</p>
<p>is something they&rsquo;ve never sorted out.</p>
<p>I mean, how do you run a banking system</p>
<p>if your intellectual priorities are really about</p>
<p>the length of a beard?</p>
<p>And then their path to power in a kind of abstract sense,</p>
<p>I mean, a lot of that was very much driven by,</p>
<p>if you like, propagating the promise of martyrdom.</p>
<p>And that sounds, I don&rsquo;t mean to say that in a way</p>
<p>that, to make it sound ridiculous,</p>
<p>to make it sound like it&rsquo;s a moral judgment,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s simply, I think, a fact, it&rsquo;s a fact of their appeal</p>
<p>that they promised young men who have known nothing else</p>
<p>but studying in certain schools, if at all,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;ve known fighting</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ve known victimization.</p>
<p>And this isn&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;m not asking for sympathy for them,</p>
<p>but I think the reality is that a lot of the,</p>
<p>we know about the kind of foot soldiers</p>
<p>is that they lost families in bombings,</p>
<p>in airstrikes, in night raids.</p>
<p>I mean, orphans have always been a stream,</p>
<p>living in all male society, not knowing girls,</p>
<p>not knowing women, hearing things from outside</p>
<p>about places like Kabul.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s always been this kind of urban rural</p>
<p>dimension, it&rsquo;s not just that,</p>
<p>but I think there&rsquo;s a whole imagination</p>
<p>that being Taliban captures.</p>
<p>And the whole margin of thing is really it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>you know, I think to any religious person,</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s not a bizarre idea.</p>
<p>I mean, it animates, I mean, so many global traditions,</p>
<p>you know, but I think the,</p>
<p>but you try to tell like an army colonel,</p>
<p>if you were to have a conversation with,</p>
<p>you know, a US Marine about this,</p>
<p>I mean, some would get it</p>
<p>from their own religious backgrounds,</p>
<p>but I think it&rsquo;s an alien idea,</p>
<p>but I think it&rsquo;s essential to kind of stretch out</p>
<p>my imagination to understand that&rsquo;s attractive.</p>
<p>And now one of the dilemmas going forward</p>
<p>is that they&rsquo;ve got to pivot from martyrdom.</p>
<p>And some have been, some have told foreign journalists,</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s good that we&rsquo;re in charge now,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna build a proper state,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s kind of boring.</p>
<p>I wanna keep fighting, maybe I&rsquo;ll do that in Pakistan.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, it&rsquo;s nice that they are expressing</p>
<p>that thought, some are not even honest sufficiently</p>
<p>with themselves to express that kind of thought.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a fighter,</p>
<p>you see that with a bunch of fighters</p>
<p>or professional athletes, once they retire,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t know, it&rsquo;s very, it&rsquo;s boring.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>And so like if the spirit of the Taliban,</p>
<p>even the best version of the Taliban is to fight,</p>
<p>is to be martyrs, is to paint the world as good and evil</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re fighting evil and all that kind of stuff,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s difficult to imagine how they can run</p>
<p>an education system, a banking system,</p>
<p>respect all kinds of citizens with different backgrounds</p>
<p>and religious beliefs and women and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Yeah, and they&rsquo;ve walked into Kabul</p>
<p>and other major cities, some of them are young,</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t know those places,</p>
<p>but also the very important obstacle for them</p>
<p>is that Afghan society has changed.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s not what, even for the older guys,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not what they knew in the 1990s.</p>
<p>Some always had some ambivalence about the capital,</p>
<p>but now it&rsquo;s totally different.</p>
<p>I mean, they&rsquo;ve been shocked to see, I think to me,</p>
<p>one of the most striking features of the last few weeks</p>
<p>has been that women have come out on the streets</p>
<p>and have stood in their faces and said,</p>
<p>we demand rights, we demand education,</p>
<p>we demand employment.</p>
<p>And these foot soldiers are paralyzed, they&rsquo;re not sure.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t know what to do with women, period.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>And they don&rsquo;t know what to do with being yelled at</p>
<p>and having someone stick their fingers in their faces.</p>
<p>I mean, this is not what they&rsquo;ve imagined.</p>
<p>And so I think, and at this juncture,</p>
<p>there are still foreign cameras around.</p>
<p>So they have committed acts of violence against women,</p>
<p>against journalists, they&rsquo;ve beaten people,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve disappeared people.</p>
<p>Even with cameras around, even in this tense period.</p>
<p>Yeah, but I think that when the cameras retreat</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s not gonna happen,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna get much worse, I think.</p>
<p>So the challenge now is can the Taliban rule?</p>
<p>And then this is where the diplomacy is so important</p>
<p>because the Taliban can&rsquo;t rule in isolation</p>
<p>and they know that.</p>
<p>And part of the success is due to the fact</p>
<p>that they became very good at talking to other people</p>
<p>in the last, I mean, it&rsquo;s been building for the last decade,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;d say the last five years,</p>
<p>they always had Pakistan&rsquo;s backing.</p>
<p>And so the Taliban are, we noted they&rsquo;re a military force,</p>
<p>very effective guerrilla force.</p>
<p>They beat NATO, I mean, this is, still hasn&rsquo;t sunk in.</p>
<p>I mean, the fact that they, with light arms,</p>
<p>using suicide attacks, using mines,</p>
<p>improvised explosive devices, machine guns.</p>
<p>In some, in recent years, they got sniper rifles</p>
<p>and from the summer, they got American equipment</p>
<p>on a broad scale, right?</p>
<p>They have airplanes, they have a lot</p>
<p>that they will be able to use eventually.</p>
<p>So, but still, basically it&rsquo;s a story of AK47s,</p>
<p>some American small arms and mines.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s very Ho Chi Minh,</p>
<p>very old school guerrilla fighting, right?</p>
<p>And they defeated the most powerful military alliance</p>
<p>in world history probably.</p>
<p>So that has not yet sunk in and what that means</p>
<p>for American and global politics.</p>
<p>And now they&rsquo;re trying to rule, right?</p>
<p>They know they need international support</p>
<p>and their most consistent backer has been Pakistan</p>
<p>who sees them as an extension of Pakistani power.</p>
<p>And this is very important for a Pakistani elite</p>
<p>that of course is looking toward India.</p>
<p>They wanna have their rear covered, right?</p>
<p>They wanna make sure that these Pashtuns</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t cause trouble for Pakistan.</p>
<p>And they like, I mean, for some of the security forces,</p>
<p>they like this vision of the Islamic state</p>
<p>that the Taliban are building there</p>
<p>because those are not so distant from their views</p>
<p>of what Pakistan should be.</p>
<p>But the Taliban have been smart enough</p>
<p>to kind of diversify their potential international allies.</p>
<p>So everyone in the neighborhood</p>
<p>has wanted the US to leave, right?</p>
<p>If we go back to 2001,</p>
<p>there were Iranian and American special forces in the North</p>
<p>working together against the Taliban to displace them</p>
<p>using Iranian, American, and then Afghan resistance forces</p>
<p>against the Taliban.</p>
<p>And that was a real moment of rapprochement</p>
<p>if we go back to the missed exits.</p>
<p>The relationship with Iran</p>
<p>could have been different at that moment,</p>
<p>but the US under George W. Bush, you know,</p>
<p>devised this axis of evil language,</p>
<p>put them together with their enemy,</p>
<p>Iraq and the North Korea, all that went south.</p>
<p>That was the most opportunity.</p>
<p>But in recent years, the Taliban and Iran</p>
<p>have kind of papered over the differences.</p>
<p>They allowed the Taliban to open small offices</p>
<p>on Iranian territory,</p>
<p>likely shared some resources, some intelligence,</p>
<p>some sophisticated weaponry.</p>
<p>And then the Taliban went to Moscow.</p>
<p>And for the Putin administration,</p>
<p>you know, they&rsquo;ve long been worried that,</p>
<p>you know, they see the Taliban as a kind of,</p>
<p>you know, disease that will potentially move North,</p>
<p>infect Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan,</p>
<p>Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan,</p>
<p>and maybe creep into Russia&rsquo;s sphere of influence.</p>
<p>Maybe that&rsquo;s why they have, you know,</p>
<p>a bunch of troops sitting in Tajikistan.</p>
<p>I mean, the one, you know,</p>
<p>Ford base that Russia as well has in Central Asia</p>
<p>is in Tajikistan.</p>
<p>And so the Taliban were always, you know,</p>
<p>a worrying point, but also useful because</p>
<p>they could say, well, you know,</p>
<p>in case the Taliban get out of control,</p>
<p>we need to be here.</p>
<p>And so Tajikistan said, okay, you know,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re helping secure us.</p>
<p>And yes, it impinges upon our sovereignty,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s okay, you know?</p>
<p>So Putin said, you know, let&rsquo;s, you know,</p>
<p>give another black eye to the Americans</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s, you know, treat the Taliban</p>
<p>as if they&rsquo;re the kind of government in waiting.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s have them come to Moscow multiple times.</p>
<p>This summer, you know, for the last year or two,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve been talking to China, right?</p>
<p>So the photographs of senior Taliban figures</p>
<p>going from their office in Qatar,</p>
<p>which was a major blow to the U.S. back government,</p>
<p>the fact that they were able to open up</p>
<p>an office in Qatar that at one point</p>
<p>began to fly a flag of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan,</p>
<p>that basically said, we&rsquo;re a state in the waiting.</p>
<p>And as the U.S.-backed Afghan government failed</p>
<p>and failed and failed at ruling too, right?</p>
<p>As they showed how corrupt they were.</p>
<p>And as they really alienated more and more Afghans</p>
<p>by committing acts of violence against them,</p>
<p>by stealing from them, by, you know,</p>
<p>basically creating a kind of kleptocracy, right?</p>
<p>The Taliban said, we are pure, we are not corrupt.</p>
<p>And look at us, we&rsquo;re winning on the battlefield.</p>
<p>And internationally, look, we&rsquo;re talking to China.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking to Putin, we&rsquo;re talking to China.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re a legitimate, powerful center of Central Asia.</p>
<p>And also kind of, you know, hinting that, you know,</p>
<p>oh, we have a website.</p>
<p>I mean, the whole digital angle is amazing</p>
<p>because they began to, and this is important, actually.</p>
<p>They had a website which grew more and more sophisticated.</p>
<p>Again, after having, you know, shot televisions</p>
<p>and these kind of ceremonial killings</p>
<p>of these infidel devices, right?</p>
<p>They said, we have a government, we have commissions,</p>
<p>we have a complaint line.</p>
<p>They lifted all this technocratic language</p>
<p>that you would get from any UN document,</p>
<p>you know, about good governance</p>
<p>and all the kind of, you know, generic language</p>
<p>that the NGO world has produced for us, right, in English.</p>
<p>They reproduced that in five languages</p>
<p>on their Taiwan website.</p>
<p>And of course, I&rsquo;m not saying even believe this,</p>
<p>but it was like, you know, just put me in coach.</p>
<p>You know, I know the playbook.</p>
<p>I know how to run a government.</p>
<p>And look, we have an agricultural commission.</p>
<p>We have, you know, a taxation system.</p>
<p>And again, this idea, and then on the ground,</p>
<p>they had their own law courts.</p>
<p>And they would creep into a district,</p>
<p>assassinate some people, the local authority figures,</p>
<p>men of influence, talk to local clerics,</p>
<p>either get them on board or kill them and say, you know,</p>
<p>this state is corrupt, but we&rsquo;re bringing you justice.</p>
<p>This is our calling card.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re bringing public reality and justice.</p>
<p>And then to a broader world, they said, you know,</p>
<p>yeah, things didn&rsquo;t go perfectly, the whole Al Qaeda thing,</p>
<p>you know, you know, wish we could have a do over on that.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not gonna let anyone hurt you from our territory.</p>
<p>We just wanna rule and people like us and look.</p>
<p>And so if you look at the neighborhood,</p>
<p>Iran, even the Central Asian states after a while,</p>
<p>recognizing they could make some money.</p>
<p>I mean, one of the, one thing that Uzbekistan likes</p>
<p>about the current arrangement, or they&rsquo;re not,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not hostile to is that they have all these contracts.</p>
<p>They can potentially make some money from, you know,</p>
<p>the pipeline dream remains alive, running natural gas, oil,</p>
<p>to, you know, which is the Indian ocean,</p>
<p>to markets, you know, beyond Central Asia.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sitting on a couple of trillion dollars,</p>
<p>probably in mineral resources</p>
<p>that China would love to have, of course.</p>
<p>And so people are looking at Afghanistan now,</p>
<p>after 20 years saying, you know, under American rule,</p>
<p>it was a basket case, right?</p>
<p>There was immense human suffering, incredibly violent.</p>
<p>The world did not start counting civilian casualties</p>
<p>in Afghanistan until 2009.</p>
<p>I mean, think about that.</p>
<p>The war went on for eight years.</p>
<p>The Taliban were never really defeated.</p>
<p>They just went to Pakistan.</p>
<p>They went to the mountains, they went to the woods.</p>
<p>And so all of these different American operations,</p>
<p>as you noted, under Bush, Obama, Trump, and so on,</p>
<p>killed countless civilians.</p>
<p>The US never accounted for that.</p>
<p>We never even counted.</p>
<p>Trump escalated civilian casualties</p>
<p>by escalating the air war.</p>
<p>But a lot of this was like very ugly, on the ground,</p>
<p>you know, night raid stuff,</p>
<p>where you drop into a Hamlet and massacre people,</p>
<p>and then you&rsquo;re not honest about what happened, right?</p>
<p>So that dynamic continued to fuel the growth of the Taliban</p>
<p>from below.</p>
<p>So the foot soldiers, they never ran out of foot soldiers.</p>
<p>I mean, the US and its allies killed tens of thousands,</p>
<p>maybe hundreds of thousands of Taliban fighters</p>
<p>over the last 20 years.</p>
<p>But they just sprouted up again.</p>
<p>And part of that was the kind of solidarity culture,</p>
<p>the male bonding of martyrology, of martyrdom,</p>
<p>and of revenge, and a sense of the foreign invader.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve heard, I mean, I haven&rsquo;t taught a ton</p>
<p>of US military people, but through the Hoover,</p>
<p>they put officers in our classes sometimes,</p>
<p>and met a few wonderful army and marine officers</p>
<p>who I really enjoyed.</p>
<p>You know, we came from the South like me,</p>
<p>always had great rapport with them,</p>
<p>and they expressed a range of opinions about this.</p>
<p>I think that I learned a lot from someone who said,</p>
<p>yeah, I mean, I get why they hate us.</p>
<p>I get why they&rsquo;re still fighting,</p>
<p>because last week, we were in the middle of a war,</p>
<p>we just killed 14 of their fellow villagers.</p>
<p>So the officers, the guys on the ground,</p>
<p>fighting this war, we&rsquo;re not stupid about that.</p>
<p>I mean, they got the human dimension of that,</p>
<p>and yet no one got off the exit,</p>
<p>as you said, people kept driving.</p>
<p>But going forward now, internationally,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s critical that they have,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ve had meetings.</p>
<p>I mean, what the Taliban have done since August 15th</p>
<p>is a lot of diplomacy.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve had meetings, they&rsquo;ve had people,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve had Tashkent come, they&rsquo;ve had Beijing come,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve had Moscow come.</p>
<p>I mean, they&rsquo;ve had major visits from Islamabad,</p>
<p>from security people, from diplomatic circles.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re counting on things being different this time.</p>
<p>I mean, the first time around,</p>
<p>the only people who backed the Taliban by recognition,</p>
<p>giving them diplomatic recognition,</p>
<p>were the Saudis, Pakistanis, and the UAE.</p>
<p>And because of Al Qaeda, because of opium,</p>
<p>because of some of the human rights stuff,</p>
<p>the US pushed everyone to like,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s not recognize the state,</p>
<p>even though the US did.</p>
<p>I mean, Colin Powell famously,</p>
<p>summer of 2001, we did give a few grants and aid</p>
<p>to the Taliban as kind of like massaging negotiations.</p>
<p>They kept talking about bin Laden,</p>
<p>but they also wanted them to stop opium production.</p>
<p>I mean, Afghanistan, throughout all this period</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve talked about, is the global center</p>
<p>of opium production.</p>
<p>I mean, over the years, more and more of the Afghan economy</p>
<p>continued to today is devoted to the opium trade.</p>
<p>Opium, which is the thing that leads to heroin,</p>
<p>some of the painkillers.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And even if Afghan poppies don&rsquo;t make it to Hoboken,</p>
<p>they are not the source of American deaths.</p>
<p>They are part of a universal market, a global market,</p>
<p>which I think any economist would tell you</p>
<p>is part of the story of our opium problem.</p>
<p>Something I read maybe a decade ago now,</p>
<p>and I just kind of looked it up again</p>
<p>to bring it up to see your opinion on this,</p>
<p>is a 2010 report by the International Council</p>
<p>on Security and Development that showed</p>
<p>that 92% of Afghans in Helmand and Kandahar province</p>
<p>know nothing of the 9 11 attacks on US in 2001.</p>
<p>Is this at all representative of what you know?</p>
<p>Is this possible?</p>
<p>So basically, put another way,</p>
<p>is it possible that a lot of Afghans don&rsquo;t even know</p>
<p>the reason why there may be troops</p>
<p>or the sort of American provided narrative</p>
<p>for why there&rsquo;s troops, American soldiers,</p>
<p>and American drones overhead in Afghanistan?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I mean, my gut response,</p>
<p>not knowing the details of this actual poll is</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s a very unhelpful way to think about</p>
<p>how Afghans relate to the world.</p>
<p>And I think it could be, if you go to my hometown,</p>
<p>in North Carolina, if you knock on some doors,</p>
<p>you may meet people who don&rsquo;t know all kinds of things.</p>
<p>I could probably walk around this neighborhood</p>
<p>here in California and there&rsquo;d be all kinds of people</p>
<p>who don&rsquo;t know all kinds of things.</p>
<p>Kyrie Irving apparently thinks the earth is flat.</p>
<p>I mean, so we could make a lot of certain kinds</p>
<p>of ignorance, I think.</p>
<p>But I think what I would say,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s also, I mean, a companion point maybe</p>
<p>that in thinking about the withdrawal, the collapse,</p>
<p>the return of the Taliban,</p>
<p>there has been a big conversation</p>
<p>about what Afghans think of us really.</p>
<p>And this famous piece in the New Yorker</p>
<p>was about how many people liked the Taliban,</p>
<p>that many women interviewed supposedly in this piece,</p>
<p>were sympathetic because they had lost family members</p>
<p>and all the violence.</p>
<p>And the idea kind of was that,</p>
<p>we haven&rsquo;t thought about that at all.</p>
<p>When in fact, of course we have and lots of people have,</p>
<p>but I think if you&rsquo;re just dropping into the conversation,</p>
<p>if you look at like an immediate arc of coverage</p>
<p>of Afghanistan and the United States,</p>
<p>I mean, the arc went from lots of coverage during,</p>
<p>of course, 9.11 and its aftermath,</p>
<p>lots of coverage during Obama&rsquo;s surge,</p>
<p>and then quickly dropped down the last decade,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s been almost nothing.</p>
<p>So if you ask the same question about Americans</p>
<p>or of Americans, I&rsquo;m not sure what they would say to you,</p>
<p>what percentage would actually know</p>
<p>why the US is in X, Y, or Z either, right?</p>
<p>But on the Afghan side, just to return to that for a moment,</p>
<p>I think that we can fetishize these provinces.</p>
<p>They are kind of a place</p>
<p>where Taliban support has been greatest.</p>
<p>Also where there&rsquo;s been the most violence,</p>
<p>where the Americans have been most committed</p>
<p>to trying to root out the Taliban movement.</p>
<p>Where exactly in the South.</p>
<p>What are the other parts in the South of Afghanistan?</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s mostly Pashtun, not exclusively,</p>
<p>but mostly Pashtun, mostly rural.</p>
<p>What is Pashtun?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the other group</p>
<p>that the Taliban claim to represent, right?</p>
<p>So they are this group.</p>
<p>What other groups are there?</p>
<p>Okay, sorry, yeah, sorry.</p>
<p>So in cities, you&rsquo;ll find everything, right?</p>
<p>That is in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll find Uzbeks, Tajiks, Hazaras.</p>
<p>These are people who, Uzbek is a Turkic language, right?</p>
<p>Most Uzbeks live in what is now Uzbekistan,</p>
<p>but they form majorities in some Northern parts of the city.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, of the country of Afghanistan.</p>
<p>But what I emphasize is that,</p>
<p>and you can find online an ethnographic map of Afghanistan</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll see green where Pashtuns live,</p>
<p>red where Hazaras live, orange where Uzbeks live,</p>
<p>purple where Tajiks live.</p>
<p>Then there are a bunch of other smaller groups</p>
<p>of different kinds.</p>
<p>There are Noristanis, there are Baluch,</p>
<p>there are, in different religious communities,</p>
<p>there are Sunni, Shia, different kinds of Shia.</p>
<p>What are the key differences between them?</p>
<p>Is it religious basis from the origins</p>
<p>of where they immigrated from and how different are they?</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re all, I mean, they&rsquo;re all indigenous, I think.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s a kind of mythology</p>
<p>that some groups have been there longer, right?</p>
<p>So they have a greater claim to power.</p>
<p>But historically, I mean, it&rsquo;s like, you know,</p>
<p>ethnic groups anywhere,</p>
<p>people have different narratives about themselves,</p>
<p>but many Pashtuns would tell you, not all,</p>
<p>but many would say,</p>
<p>we are the kind of state builders of Afghanistan.</p>
<p>The dynasty that ruled much of the space,</p>
<p>that was born in the mid 18th century,</p>
<p>that ruled until 1973, more or less,</p>
<p>generalizing, you know, it was a Pashtun dynasty.</p>
<p>The Taliban have definitely said to some audiences,</p>
<p>we are the rightful rulers because we are Pashtun.</p>
<p>The trick though is, I don&rsquo;t mean to be evasive,</p>
<p>but just to convey some of the complexity,</p>
<p>one quick answer as well,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re majorities and minorities.</p>
<p>I mean, one finds that a lot along with those maps,</p>
<p>but I would say suspend any firm belief in that</p>
<p>because that could be entirely wrong.</p>
<p>In fact, there&rsquo;s never been a modern census of Afghanistan.</p>
<p>So when journalists say Pashtuns are the majority,</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;re the biggest group, I would say not so fast.</p>
<p>I would say not so fast</p>
<p>because of migration is one major issue.</p>
<p>No major modern census.</p>
<p>Actually, the Soviets got pretty close,</p>
<p>but didn&rsquo;t quite, you know, find something comprehensive</p>
<p>and didn&rsquo;t publicize it knowing that it was,</p>
<p>you know, in modern times,</p>
<p>ethnicity can be the source of political mobilization.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not innately so, but it&rsquo;s been part of the story.</p>
<p>But then you have mixed families, right?</p>
<p>So a lot of people you&rsquo;ll meet,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll encounter in the diaspora and around,</p>
<p>I mean, well, I am, you know,</p>
<p>my one parent is Tajik, one is Pashtun, right?</p>
<p>Or I&rsquo;m Pashtun, as I mentioned before,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t speak Pashto, right?</p>
<p>Or I am Hazara, but you read about us as Shiite Hazara,</p>
<p>in fact, I&rsquo;m a Sunni Hazara,</p>
<p>or I&rsquo;m a secular Hazara, or I&rsquo;m an atheist Hazara.</p>
<p>I mean, everything&rsquo;s possible, right?</p>
<p>One of my friends, if he were here,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;d say, I&rsquo;m Kabuli, you know, I&rsquo;m from Kabul.</p>
<p>So if you think about it in Russian terms,</p>
<p>you know, it means a lot if you&rsquo;re a Muscovitch,</p>
<p>you know, if you&rsquo;re from Pisa or Moscow, I mean, you know.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, even here is Pashtunians, Texans, Californians.</p>
<p>Yeah, East Coast, West Coast, all that stuff.</p>
<p>Those are all part of the mix here.</p>
<p>So you asked about Kandahar and Helmand,</p>
<p>then I would say, yeah, if you go out to, you know,</p>
<p>a pomegranate field, you&rsquo;ll meet a guy</p>
<p>who may reckon time differently from you and me,</p>
<p>who may not be literate,</p>
<p>you may not have ever had a geography lesson,</p>
<p>but if you go one door over, you may meet a guy</p>
<p>who, you know, his life path has taken him</p>
<p>to live in, you know, six countries.</p>
<p>He may speak five languages.</p>
<p>And these are all things I&rsquo;m not saying they&rsquo;re all,</p>
<p>these are just because people have money</p>
<p>can go fly around.</p>
<p>I mean, there are people who are displaced by war</p>
<p>from late 1970s, right?</p>
<p>Even already in the early 70s,</p>
<p>people were traveling by the tens of thousands to Iran,</p>
<p>you know, as labor migrants.</p>
<p>And once you get to Iran, once you get to Pakistan,</p>
<p>once you get to Uzbekistan,</p>
<p>you then connect to all kinds of cosmopolitan cultures.</p>
<p>And in fact, I think one of the themes of the book,</p>
<p>you know, that you may or may not have read,</p>
<p>it may put you to sleep.</p>
<p>You know, Afghan Modern was about, you know,</p>
<p>conceptualizing Afghanistan as a cosmopolitan place</p>
<p>where for centuries people put on the move</p>
<p>and trade in this area.</p>
<p>You think of, you know, I think this mischaracterization</p>
<p>of places like Helmand and Kandahar,</p>
<p>you know, you fly in or you&rsquo;re part of a Marine battalion</p>
<p>and you see people there and they look different.</p>
<p>And I think in our imagination, if I can generalize,</p>
<p>you know, they look like they&rsquo;ve been there</p>
<p>for millennia, right?</p>
<p>The dress, the whatever, right?</p>
<p>You think of technology,</p>
<p>you think of the mud compounds and so on.</p>
<p>You think of, you know, animal drawn transportation,</p>
<p>that kind of stuff, right?</p>
<p>Or the motorbike, right, at most is what they have.</p>
<p>But in fact, if you follow those families,</p>
<p>their trade has taken them to Northern India</p>
<p>for centuries, right?</p>
<p>Their trade has connected them to cosmopolitan centers.</p>
<p>You know, say they have a scholar in the family,</p>
<p>that scholar may have studied</p>
<p>all of the Middle East, South Asia, right?</p>
<p>You know, their ancestors may have been horse traders</p>
<p>who went all the way to Moscow, right?</p>
<p>I mean, we have a sort of records of all these people</p>
<p>traveling across Eurasia,</p>
<p>pursuing all kinds of livelihoods.</p>
<p>And so Afghanistan is this paradox</p>
<p>of visually looking remote</p>
<p>and looking like it&rsquo;s kind of stuck in time,</p>
<p>but the family trajectories</p>
<p>and the current trajectories</p>
<p>are astoundingly cosmopolitan and mobile.</p>
<p>And so, and a conception of being a world center</p>
<p>is also quite strong.</p>
<p>So, you know, another way to frame that question about like,</p>
<p>do they know about 9.11 would be like,</p>
<p>why should we know about 9.11?</p>
<p>Because we are at the center of something important, right?</p>
<p>We are the center of Asia.</p>
<p>We are the heart of Asia.</p>
<p>We have a kind of historic greatness.</p>
<p>We are a proud culture of our own achievements, right?</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re not worried about that, right?</p>
<p>That said, I mean, sure,</p>
<p>there are different narratives about</p>
<p>why Americans are there,</p>
<p>why people are being killed.</p>
<p>You know, of course you&rsquo;d find,</p>
<p>they want to convert us,</p>
<p>they want our gold,</p>
<p>they want our opium,</p>
<p>they want X, Y, and Z, right?</p>
<p>There was a recent story about a Taliban official</p>
<p>sitting in an office in Kabul</p>
<p>and a journalist asked him,</p>
<p>what can you find in this rotating globe?</p>
<p>Find your country,</p>
<p>find where are we sitting right now?</p>
<p>And he was filmed not being able to do it.</p>
<p>And so a lot of, you know,</p>
<p>race sophisticated Afghans in the diaspora</p>
<p>were saying, you know, ha ha, look at this.</p>
<p>And that exists.</p>
<p>I mean, I think I could go to my Stanford classroom</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;d be a lot of kids</p>
<p>who wouldn&rsquo;t know where Afghanistan is too, right?</p>
<p>But I guess I wouldn&rsquo;t use those metrics</p>
<p>to suggest that this is a place</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t have a sense of its place in the world</p>
<p>and of geopolitics.</p>
<p>I think if anything,</p>
<p>being a relatively small country</p>
<p>in a very complicated neighborhood,</p>
<p>I mean, everybody, every cab driver,</p>
<p>I mean, people have, I mean,</p>
<p>you know, this is where America is different</p>
<p>because I don&rsquo;t think Americans have this sense.</p>
<p>You know, we&rsquo;re talking about Moscow and stuff.</p>
<p>I think, you know, Moscow cab drivers,</p>
<p>I think a lot of them are gonna tell you,</p>
<p>like what&rsquo;s happening in the world and why, right?</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just part of their thing, right?</p>
<p>You can find that in Ghana,</p>
<p>you can find that in Mexico city, right?</p>
<p>You find that lots of places.</p>
<p>So I think Afghans are part of a very sophisticated</p>
<p>kind of mapping of the world and where they fit in.</p>
<p>And a lot of them remarkably had done it firsthand,</p>
<p>which is what struck me so much.</p>
<p>And, you know, really my experiences</p>
<p>from the 1990s and Tashkent places</p>
<p>that these guys had already lived</p>
<p>in more countries than I&rsquo;d ever been.</p>
<p>They already knew half those languages.</p>
<p>I mean, this one friend&rsquo;s Russian was impeccable.</p>
<p>And of course it helped, they had Russian girlfriends,</p>
<p>they had, you know, they mixed with the police,</p>
<p>they had run ins, I mean,</p>
<p>this wasn&rsquo;t something you got from a book, right?</p>
<p>This was like hard knock life.</p>
<p>I mean, one friend was from a wealthy family</p>
<p>in this trading diaspora and he was imprisoned.</p>
<p>I mean, they sent him to prison in Pakistan</p>
<p>and he talks about how he could start like running,</p>
<p>running in the jail, you know,</p>
<p>taking cigarettes to people, doing little things</p>
<p>and kind of, you know, these are not stories of like,</p>
<p>oh, I went to Harvard and so I&rsquo;m so learned</p>
<p>because of this.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s a whole range of experiences.</p>
<p>The interesting thing is the survey is a survey</p>
<p>and it doesn&rsquo;t reflect ignorance,</p>
<p>as you&rsquo;re saying, perhaps,</p>
<p>but it may reflect a different geopolitical view</p>
<p>of the world than the West has.</p>
<p>So if, you know, for a lot of the world,</p>
<p>9 11 was one of the most important moments</p>
<p>of recent human history.</p>
<p>And for Afghanistan to not to know that,</p>
<p>especially when they&rsquo;re part of that story,</p>
<p>means they have a very different,</p>
<p>like there could be a lot of things said.</p>
<p>One is the spread of information is different.</p>
<p>The channels of the way information is spread.</p>
<p>And two of the things they care about,</p>
<p>maybe they see themselves as part of a longer arc</p>
<p>of history where the bickering of these superpowers</p>
<p>that seem to want to go to the moon</p>
<p>are not as important as the big sort of arc</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s been the story of Afghanistan.</p>
<p>You know, that&rsquo;s an interesting idea,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s still a bit, if at all,</p>
<p>representative of the truth.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s heartbreaking that they&rsquo;re not,</p>
<p>do not see themselves as active player</p>
<p>in this game between the United States</p>
<p>and Central Asia, because they&rsquo;re such a critical player.</p>
<p>And I feel, and obviously, in many ways,</p>
<p>get the short end of the stick in this whole interaction</p>
<p>with the invasion of Afghanistan for many years,</p>
<p>and then this rushed withdrawal of troops,</p>
<p>and now the economic collapse, and it&rsquo;s sad in some ways.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>I mean, you know, another way to put it is this.</p>
<p>I mean, yeah, there&rsquo;s a range of knowledge,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re right, the information flows</p>
<p>are peculiar to particular geographies</p>
<p>and histories and stuff.</p>
<p>I think that, you know, plucking out one sample</p>
<p>from some fairly remote area,</p>
<p>from one like follow the agricultural products.</p>
<p>I mean, and this is where, you know,</p>
<p>I think urban rural divides used to mean a lot more</p>
<p>in the 19th century, right?</p>
<p>So a lot of like the nuts and bolts of history</p>
<p>is about conceiving of these kinds of distinctions,</p>
<p>but I think that if one has the privilege</p>
<p>of traveling a bit, you see that like urban areas</p>
<p>are fed by rural hinterlands.</p>
<p>And if you think of who actually brings the bread,</p>
<p>the milk, the pomegranates and so on,</p>
<p>it creates these networks.</p>
<p>And then, you know, mobility channels,</p>
<p>information and so on.</p>
<p>But yeah, but your broader point</p>
<p>about like the tragedy of this,</p>
<p>I mean, I guess if I can quote a brilliant student of mine,</p>
<p>an Afghan American woman who just received her PhD,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s now, you know, a doctor, he&rsquo;s a great scholar.</p>
<p>You know, we&rsquo;ve done several events now</p>
<p>trying to just think through what&rsquo;s happened.</p>
<p>And of course, she&rsquo;s very emotionally affected by it.</p>
<p>And she continues to ask a really great question.</p>
<p>If I can get her phrasing right, you know,</p>
<p>if you think of the cycle of like the Taliban</p>
<p>being in power in 2001 and the way in which</p>
<p>that affected women in particular,</p>
<p>you know, half Afghan, half of the society, right?</p>
<p>Then you think of this 20 year period of violence</p>
<p>and, you know, missed exits, right?</p>
<p>And repeated tragedy that also it created a space.</p>
<p>I mean, it created a space for a whole generation.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say generationally, it created a sense,</p>
<p>a space for people to realize something new.</p>
<p>And I think, so we have to attend to the dynamism</p>
<p>of the society, right?</p>
<p>So yeah, this happened mostly in Kabul,</p>
<p>other big cities, Mazar Sharif, Herat, and Kandahar.</p>
<p>But you can&rsquo;t limit your analysis to that</p>
<p>because things like radio, television,</p>
<p>everyone got a TV channel.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a wonderful documentary called Afghan Star</p>
<p>that I recommend to your listeners and viewers</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s about a singing show, a singing contest show.</p>
<p>But you see just for some of these things</p>
<p>about like connections, I mean,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a show by an independent television network</p>
<p>that did drama, it did kind of infomercials</p>
<p>for the government and huge American investment in it.</p>
<p>So it wasn&rsquo;t politically neutral,</p>
<p>but it did talk shows, did all this kind of stuff.</p>
<p>But it did a singing show that became incredibly popular,</p>
<p>modeled upon the British American,</p>
<p>you know, American Idol kind of stuff, you know,</p>
<p>and you could vote.</p>
<p>So it had a kind of democratic practice element.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s fascinating to see that, you know,</p>
<p>people hooked up generators to televisions and watch this,</p>
<p>you know, you think of like literacy rates,</p>
<p>literacy rates are imperfect.</p>
<p>And, you know, people who study, you know,</p>
<p>medieval or modern Europe talk about how,</p>
<p>yeah, no one could read and there weren&rsquo;t many books,</p>
<p>but if someone had a book, it&rsquo;d be read aloud</p>
<p>to a whole village potentially or gathering.</p>
<p>So there isn&rsquo;t much, you know,</p>
<p>some of these metrics don&rsquo;t get what people actually</p>
<p>receive as information or exposure</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s the magnifying power of open spaces</p>
<p>and hearing radio in group settings,</p>
<p>seeing television group settings, having telephone,</p>
<p>you know, cheap telephones, which then become an access</p>
<p>point to the world and social media, right?</p>
<p>So all the stuff swept across Afghan society</p>
<p>as it did elsewhere, you know, in the last decade or more.</p>
<p>So Afghan society became, you know, in important ways,</p>
<p>really connected to everything going on.</p>
<p>And so you see that reflected politically</p>
<p>and what people wanted.</p>
<p>So you had some people obviously</p>
<p>back to return to the Taliban,</p>
<p>some people wanted the status quo,</p>
<p>but increasingly many more people wanted something else.</p>
<p>And one of the great failures was</p>
<p>to expose people to democracy,</p>
<p>but only give them the rigged version.</p>
<p>And so the US State Department in particular</p>
<p>continued to double down on faked elections</p>
<p>for the parliament and for the presidency in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>What kind of elections?</p>
<p>Faked, fraudulent elections for parliament</p>
<p>and for president in Afghanistan again and again</p>
<p>from the very beginning.</p>
<p>And those elections were partly theater for the US,</p>
<p>like for remaining on the road that you&rsquo;re describing,</p>
<p>right, for not deviating, for not exiting</p>
<p>because we were building democracy there.</p>
<p>In reality, the US government knew</p>
<p>it was never really building democracy there.</p>
<p>It was establishing control</p>
<p>and elections were one of the means to gather control,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>But then you had on the ground,</p>
<p>especially among young people going to university,</p>
<p>you know, having experiences</p>
<p>that were denied to them before,</p>
<p>you know, they took these problems so seriously.</p>
<p>So part of the disillusionment that we see today</p>
<p>is that, you know, they believe what the US told them</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re constructing democracy.</p>
<p>And of course, you know, cynics like us may be thinking,</p>
<p>well, you know, you&rsquo;re not really doing that.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re backing fraud.</p>
<p>They believed it when they were younger</p>
<p>and now they&rsquo;re actually smart enough</p>
<p>to understand that it&rsquo;s a farce.</p>
<p>But in so indirectly had the consequence</p>
<p>of actually working and that it taught the young</p>
<p>over a period of 20 years, young folks to believe</p>
<p>that democracy is possible</p>
<p>and then to realize what democracy is not.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just the current system.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s beautifully said, beautifully said.</p>
<p>And so, but now look at us, now it&rsquo;s, you know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s now November.</p>
<p>And so this whole period,</p>
<p>and I wouldn&rsquo;t say like, you know,</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t cast the last 20 years</p>
<p>if we&rsquo;re looking at all the achievements, you know,</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t put them in an American tally sheet,</p>
<p>like, oh, this is something</p>
<p>we should pat ourselves on the back for.</p>
<p>I think that much of this happened actually</p>
<p>against what the Americans wanted.</p>
<p>I mean, that the kind of free thinking,</p>
<p>democracy wanting, I mean, even like, you know,</p>
<p>we could point out on the religious,</p>
<p>go back to the religious sphere.</p>
<p>I mean, the African religious landscape</p>
<p>became very pluralistic.</p>
<p>Lots of young people wanted a different kind</p>
<p>of secular politics, but the old guard</p>
<p>who wanted the status quo and wanted something</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;d fought for in 1980s tended</p>
<p>to still get American backing as the political leads,</p>
<p>who still tended to monopolize political power.</p>
<p>So all this stuff was happening in different ways.</p>
<p>I mean, the Americans established</p>
<p>this American University of Afghanistan,</p>
<p>which was, I think, one of the best things</p>
<p>the U.S. did there.</p>
<p>And I regret that the U.S. didn&rsquo;t fund 20 more,</p>
<p>you know, sprinkling them across the country,</p>
<p>making them accessible to people,</p>
<p>because it was, you know, again,</p>
<p>it wasn&rsquo;t an engine of Americanization.</p>
<p>It was just opportunity.</p>
<p>And so the thirst for higher education</p>
<p>was really extraordinary there.</p>
<p>It was never really met.</p>
<p>The U.S. tended to put money in primary education,</p>
<p>which much of that too was fraudulent.</p>
<p>But so you have all this interesting dynamism.</p>
<p>You have, you know, the arts, you have a critical space.</p>
<p>I mean, I call it a public sphere</p>
<p>in the classic European sense.</p>
<p>You know, the Afghans made of their own.</p>
<p>And again, it wasn&rsquo;t Americanization.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t imposed.</p>
<p>It was something that Afghans built across generations,</p>
<p>but really with a firm foundation among youth,</p>
<p>who wanted, importantly, a multiethnic Afghan society.</p>
<p>You asked about Pashtuns and that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>And a lot of that language in recent years was,</p>
<p>they were aware that the U.S.-backed government</p>
<p>was playing ethnic politics</p>
<p>and trying to kind of put people on the blocks</p>
<p>and mobilize people based on their ethnic identity.</p>
<p>And there was a younger cohort of people who said,</p>
<p>you know, we are Afghan.</p>
<p>And then there was interesting social media stuff</p>
<p>where people would say, I am Hazara,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m also Tajik, I&rsquo;m also Uzbek.</p>
<p>I mean, it was a way of creating</p>
<p>a multiethnic Afghan national identity</p>
<p>that embraced everything.</p>
<p>I mean, very utopian, you know, super utopian, right?</p>
<p>But symbolically, it was very important</p>
<p>that they rejected being mobilized politically,</p>
<p>you know, voting as a Hazara or voting as whatever.</p>
<p>And of course, there were communities who wanted to,</p>
<p>you know, vote as that ethnic community.</p>
<p>But there are also people who said, you know,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s put a kind of civic nationalism first,</p>
<p>one that accommodates, I think, pluralism</p>
<p>in a way that rejected the kind of majoritarian politics</p>
<p>of one ethnic group dominating the thing.</p>
<p>So all this stuff was quite interesting.</p>
<p>I mean, women were asserting themselves</p>
<p>across multiple spheres.</p>
<p>Of course, it remained patriarchal.</p>
<p>Of course, there were struggles.</p>
<p>Of course, there was violence.</p>
<p>Of course, you know, there&rsquo;s no utopia.</p>
<p>But the door on all that shut on August 15.</p>
<p>So to go back to the quote that I wanted to offer</p>
<p>from the student, now professor,</p>
<p>was it, you know, in trying to make sense of this,</p>
<p>and you mentioned the tragic arc here,</p>
<p>if you think of the 20 years, like, she asked, you know,</p>
<p>why did you go to war in our country?</p>
<p>Basically, why did you do this to us for 20 years</p>
<p>when this was never about us?</p>
<p>You know, you never asked us if you wanted to come.</p>
<p>You never asked us what you wanted to build here.</p>
<p>You didn&rsquo;t ask us when you were coming</p>
<p>and you didn&rsquo;t ask us when you were leaving.</p>
<p>You just did this all on your own.</p>
<p>And we tried to make the most of it.</p>
<p>And then you pulled the rug out from under us,</p>
<p>you know, at the 11th hour,</p>
<p>and returned to power, probably by diplomacy.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t, at the end, just a military loss.</p>
<p>I mean, it was a series of diplomatic decisions.</p>
<p>I mean, the idea, you asked about alternatives.</p>
<p>I mean, give me a Bagram.</p>
<p>I mean, holding to the timeline.</p>
<p>I mean, the Biden people did not need to hold</p>
<p>to the Doha Agreement that Trump had signed.</p>
<p>I mean, every American president</p>
<p>writes his or her own foreign policy, right?</p>
<p>So the Biden administration acted as if,</p>
<p>and they tried to convince us that their hands were tied,</p>
<p>and that it was either this or 20 more years of war</p>
<p>or some absurd kind of, you know, false alternative.</p>
<p>And so, but I think that&rsquo;s important</p>
<p>for American audiences to hear that, you know,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re like, you came to here to experiment.</p>
<p>You came here to punish.</p>
<p>You came here to kind of reassert, you know,</p>
<p>your dominance the world stage,</p>
<p>you know, to work out the fear and hurt of 9 11</p>
<p>that we talked about, which was so real, you know,</p>
<p>impalpable and so important for American politics since then.</p>
<p>Like you did, you worked out your problems,</p>
<p>you know, on us, on our territory.</p>
<p>And now what do we have for it?</p>
<p>You know, and then the people who had a stake</p>
<p>in that system, imperfect as it was,</p>
<p>have been desperate to leave.</p>
<p>And so this, I don&rsquo;t know how much people are aware of this,</p>
<p>but, you know, I&rsquo;m a scholar, I work in California,</p>
<p>you know, I have friends, I edited a journal on Afghanistan</p>
<p>and, you know, but I&rsquo;m not a politician, I&rsquo;m not a soldier,</p>
<p>but people assume that, you know,</p>
<p>Afghans have been desperately trying to reach me</p>
<p>and anyone who is kind of on the radar as an American</p>
<p>to help get them out.</p>
<p>You know, that&rsquo;s the kind of like, you know,</p>
<p>the symbol of voting with your feet, you know,</p>
<p>is quite powerful.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s a huge swath of society</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t want the system</p>
<p>and is literally living in terror about it.</p>
<p>Naturally women, you know,</p>
<p>I mean, especially women of a certain age,</p>
<p>I mean, they feel like their lives are over.</p>
<p>I mean, there is an epidemic of suicide.</p>
<p>They feel betrayed and some people have done</p>
<p>some good things in getting people out.</p>
<p>You know, I mean, some, you know,</p>
<p>the US military vets have been, you know,</p>
<p>at the forefront of working to get out people,</p>
<p>you know, that they know they owe,</p>
<p>but the US government doesn&rsquo;t want these people.</p>
<p>I mean, they have created all these obstacles</p>
<p>to allowing a safety valve for people to leave.</p>
<p>Looking forward from a perspective of leadership,</p>
<p>how do we avoid these kinds of mistakes?</p>
<p>So obviously some interests,</p>
<p>some aspects of human nature led to this war.</p>
<p>How do we resist that in the future?</p>
<p>I guess beyond my moral and intellectual capacity,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just say this, I mean, looking at it,</p>
<p>again, looking at it from my home ground as the university,</p>
<p>and I think of the intellectual,</p>
<p>you know, ways of thinking that I think students</p>
<p>should develop for themselves as citizens, right?</p>
<p>Maybe that&rsquo;s where to start is like historical thinking.</p>
<p>I mean, these are all, you know,</p>
<p>I try to tell people, you know,</p>
<p>if you want to do robotics, computer science,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d be a doctor or whatever.</p>
<p>You should study history.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, you don&rsquo;t have to be in a story like me,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s, you know, my job isn&rsquo;t perfect.</p>
<p>My profession is deeply flawed, right?</p>
<p>But as I get older, I&rsquo;m like,</p>
<p>there are fewer and fewer historians</p>
<p>that I actually like and want to hang out with and stuff.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like, I&rsquo;m not offering myself</p>
<p>as like a model for anything,</p>
<p>but you know, whether you&rsquo;re a, you know,</p>
<p>you carry the mail or you&rsquo;re a brain surgeon, whatever.</p>
<p>I mean, I think it&rsquo;s a way of civic engagement</p>
<p>and a way of like, you know, ethical being in the world</p>
<p>that we need to familiarize ourselves with,</p>
<p>because if you&rsquo;re an American</p>
<p>or if you&rsquo;re from a rich country, you know,</p>
<p>you need to be aware of your effect</p>
<p>on an intricate world.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t say anymore that you don&rsquo;t know or care</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s happening in Afghanistan</p>
<p>or really circle the globe and point to a place.</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;re all connected and we have ethical obligations.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one place to start, but I would just say this,</p>
<p>and this is a lot for a self critique,</p>
<p>and that is so much of my teaching</p>
<p>and like the themes of my research have been about empire,</p>
<p>you know, how big states work,</p>
<p>not only on big territories like the Russian Empire</p>
<p>and Soviet Union and stuff,</p>
<p>but the way in which power often is projected</p>
<p>beyond those boundaries in ways that we don&rsquo;t see.</p>
<p>So this is where things like neoliberalism</p>
<p>or just, you know, if you want to take capitalism</p>
<p>or just things that, you know, the idea of humanity</p>
<p>or of liberalism or of humanitarianism,</p>
<p>ideas that move beyond state boundaries</p>
<p>are all things that we think about as affecting power</p>
<p>in some ways that often harm people, right?</p>
<p>So I think part of, as I&rsquo;ve seen my job so far</p>
<p>is to think about, you know,</p>
<p>building upon the work of my people in grad school</p>
<p>and, you know, scholars that have affected me.</p>
<p>I mean, you know, we&rsquo;re all concerned</p>
<p>with how power works and its effects</p>
<p>and trying to be attuned to understanding</p>
<p>things that aren&rsquo;t visible, right,</p>
<p>that we should be thinking about,</p>
<p>that should be known to us.</p>
<p>And as scholars, we can hopefully play some useful role</p>
<p>in showing effects that aren&rsquo;t, you know, obvious initially.</p>
<p>So empire is a framework to think about this.</p>
<p>And so you think about invading foreign countries.</p>
<p>Obviously, if you&rsquo;re a scholar of empire,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve seen what that looks like,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s horrific, right?</p>
<p>You look at things like racism</p>
<p>as one of the ideological pillars of empire.</p>
<p>You know, that&rsquo;s horrific.</p>
<p>It must be critiqued.</p>
<p>It must be, you know, we must be educated against.</p>
<p>Some of the, you know, gender exploitation of empire</p>
<p>is also something to highlight, you know,</p>
<p>to rectify and so on.</p>
<p>You know, to be moral beings,</p>
<p>we need to think about past inequality</p>
<p>and the legacies of violence and destruction that live on.</p>
<p>I mean, living in the Americas.</p>
<p>I mean, look at, you know, we&rsquo;re all on stolen land.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re all in the sense living with the fruits of genocide</p>
<p>and slavery and all those things</p>
<p>that are hard to come to terms with, right?</p>
<p>But the last few months in Afghanistan</p>
<p>and thinking about empire, I think, made me more humble</p>
<p>when I read people who say,</p>
<p>to put it simply, have taken some joy in this moment,</p>
<p>saying like, well, the Americans</p>
<p>got kicked out of Afghanistan.</p>
<p>You know, if you&rsquo;re against empire, this is a good thing.</p>
<p>This is a kind of victory of anti colonial.</p>
<p>You could see from the perspective of Afghanistan</p>
<p>that America is not some kind of place</p>
<p>that has an ideal of freedom</p>
<p>and all the kind of things that we Americans tell ourselves,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s more America has the ideal of empire,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s one place that has the truth</p>
<p>and everybody else must follow this truth.</p>
<p>And so from a perspective of Afghanistan,</p>
<p>it could be a victory against this idea</p>
<p>of centralized truth of empire.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s another way to tell the story.</p>
<p>And then in that sense, it&rsquo;s a victory.</p>
<p>And in that sense also, I mean,</p>
<p>you push back against this somewhat,</p>
<p>this idea of Afghanistan as the graveyard of empires.</p>
<p>Right, right.</p>
<p>And outside this, I mean, I&rsquo;m a critic of empire.</p>
<p>I mean, you know, colonialism is a political phenomenon</p>
<p>that stays with us.</p>
<p>And I think, you know, we need scholars</p>
<p>to point to the way in which it still works</p>
<p>and still does harm.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s part of being an empire</p>
<p>that you can just get up and leave a place, right?</p>
<p>That you can remake its politics on one day.</p>
<p>And then because it fails to advance your agenda</p>
<p>at one moment, you simply walk away.</p>
<p>I mean, you know, we can point to other moments.</p>
<p>I mean, 1947 on the subcontinent,</p>
<p>you know, the way that the British withdrew</p>
<p>played a significant role in mass violence,</p>
<p>you know, that accompanied partition.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t all the actions of the British</p>
<p>that, you know, dictated that, right?</p>
<p>There were lots of actors who chose to pick up,</p>
<p>you know, the knife to kill their neighbor and so on.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s lots of agency in that moment</p>
<p>as there is now in what&rsquo;s happening in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>But I think the capriciousness,</p>
<p>I mean, the ability to act as if your political decisions</p>
<p>about other people&rsquo;s lives, you know,</p>
<p>are something that can be made, you know, in secret.</p>
<p>They can be made willy nilly.</p>
<p>They really are beyond the accountability, you know,</p>
<p>of those who are actually going to live</p>
<p>with the consequences of shifting the cards on a deck</p>
<p>in a way that decides who rules and who doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I would love to hear your conversation</p>
<p>with somebody I just talked to, which is Neil Ferguson,</p>
<p>who argues on the topic of empire,</p>
<p>that you can also zoom out even further</p>
<p>and say, weigh the good and the bad of empire.</p>
<p>And he argues, I think he gets a lot of flack for this</p>
<p>from other historians, that like the British empire</p>
<p>did more good than bad in certain moments of history.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s an uncomfortable truth.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s like levels, it&rsquo;s a cake</p>
<p>with layers of uncomfortable truths.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not a cake at all because none of it tastes good.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I mean, I would continue to disagree with Neil Ferguson.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m still working out where I am</p>
<p>and what this moment does to kind of, I think,</p>
<p>qualify my understanding of the past into,</p>
<p>I think in a moment of humility, I do,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m probably reacting to the kind of, as you put it,</p>
<p>I mean, the idea that this is like a good thing</p>
<p>that American power has been defeated here.</p>
<p>I mean, I do think American power should contract.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think, and again,</p>
<p>if I had to create a tally sheet</p>
<p>of what the Americans did in the US,</p>
<p>I mean, I mentioned the American University of Afghanistan.</p>
<p>It could have done that without invading the country</p>
<p>and killing people.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve not now become an apologist for empire.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not now a mini Neil Ferguson,</p>
<p>but ending empire is, I mean,</p>
<p>those decisions you make are in some ways</p>
<p>a continuation of imperil hubris, right?</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re not really out of empire yet.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not really contracting empire</p>
<p>for those who are living it, you know?</p>
<p>But I think it&rsquo;s also, I mean, maybe I put it this way,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s be careful what you ask for, you know?</p>
<p>I mean, I wanted the US out of Afghanistan,</p>
<p>but I wanted there to be a political settlement.</p>
<p>I wanted my cake and I wanted to eat it too, right?</p>
<p>I wanted all kinds of things to be different, right?</p>
<p>But why is going to Afghanistan even needed for that?</p>
<p>You can play all those games of geopolitics</p>
<p>without ever invading and taking ownership of the place.</p>
<p>It feels like the war, it feels like,</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m not exactly sure</p>
<p>what military force is necessary for,</p>
<p>except for targeted intense attacks.</p>
<p>It feels like to me, the right thing to do after 9 11</p>
<p>was to show what was a display of force</p>
<p>unlike anything the world has ever seen</p>
<p>for a very short amount of time.</p>
<p>Targeted at, sure, a terrorist,</p>
<p>at certain strongholds and so on.</p>
<p>And then in and out and then focus on education,</p>
<p>on empowering women into the education system,</p>
<p>all those kinds of things that have to do</p>
<p>with supporting the culture, the education,</p>
<p>the flourishing of the place.</p>
<p>It has nothing to do with military policing essentially.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I mean, I think, yeah, if you look at it through that lens,</p>
<p>I mean, if any Afghanistan and then if any Iraq</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t end Al Qaeda, it didn&rsquo;t end terrorism, right?</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t really deflate these ideologies entirely.</p>
<p>There were, if you like, you could say there were,</p>
<p>some limited discrediting of certain kinds of ideas.</p>
<p>But in fact, I mean,</p>
<p>look at the phenomenon of suicide bombing.</p>
<p>I mean, it spread.</p>
<p>I mean, it was never an Islamic thing.</p>
<p>It was never a Muslim thing.</p>
<p>Some Muslims adopted it in some places,</p>
<p>but the circuits of knowledge</p>
<p>about how to do these kinds of things only expanded</p>
<p>with the insurgencies that emerged in Afghanistan and Iraq,</p>
<p>and then they kind of became connected.</p>
<p>And then they began to the present.</p>
<p>I mean, the Islamic state is,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the best thing that happened to the Taliban ever</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s on the basis of its supposed new stance</p>
<p>as a counterterrorism outfit</p>
<p>that it will get recognition from all its neighbors.</p>
<p>It will get recognition from Russia.</p>
<p>I mean, already with the evacuation of the airport,</p>
<p>the United States was collaborating with the Taliban</p>
<p>against the Islamic state</p>
<p>and openly talking about the Taliban</p>
<p>as if they were partners in the security operation.</p>
<p>So, and then Al Qaeda remains present in Afghanistan, so.</p>
<p>Trillions of dollars spent.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>The drones up above bombing places</p>
<p>that result in civilian death,</p>
<p>the death of children, the death of fathers and mothers,</p>
<p>and those stories even at the individual level</p>
<p>propagate virally across the land,</p>
<p>creating potentially more terrorists.</p>
<p>And a cynical view of the trillions of dollars</p>
<p>is the military industrial complex</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s just a momentum where after 9 11,</p>
<p>the feeling like we should do something</p>
<p>led to us doing something.</p>
<p>And then a lot of people realizing they can make money</p>
<p>from doing more of that something.</p>
<p>And then it&rsquo;s just the momentum</p>
<p>where no one person is sitting there</p>
<p>petting a cat in an evil way,</p>
<p>saying we&rsquo;re going to spend all of this money</p>
<p>and create more suffering and create more terrorism.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s just something about that momentum</p>
<p>that leads to that.</p>
<p>And to me, honestly, I&rsquo;m still a sucker.</p>
<p>I believe in leadership.</p>
<p>I believe in great charismatic leaders</p>
<p>and the power of that want to do evil and to do good.</p>
<p>And it felt like I honestly put the blame on George Bush,</p>
<p>Obama, Trump, and Biden for lack of leadership.</p>
<p>Yeah, definitely, definitely.</p>
<p>I agree.</p>
<p>Yeah, there is the military industrial complex component,</p>
<p>which is huge.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s also, I mean, speaking of government leadership,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s also, I&rsquo;d say the imbalance of power within Washington.</p>
<p>I mean, the Pentagon used this moment,</p>
<p>well, beginning in 2001,</p>
<p>I think to assert this authority</p>
<p>at the expense of other institutions</p>
<p>of national government.</p>
<p>I mean, the State Department diplomacy</p>
<p>has become a shadow of what it was once capable of doing.</p>
<p>And of course, I mean, other historians, US historians,</p>
<p>which I&rsquo;m not formally a historian of the United States,</p>
<p>but we can go back to talk about Vietnam.</p>
<p>We talk about lots of Cold War and post Cold War engagements.</p>
<p>And I think we need a reckoning</p>
<p>about how the United States uses military power,</p>
<p>why we devote so much to our military budget</p>
<p>and what could be available to us</p>
<p>if we had a more sensible view</p>
<p>of the value of military power, of its effectiveness.</p>
<p>And I think we&rsquo;re willing to hammer home</p>
<p>that this was a defeat.</p>
<p>I mean, I think there should be accountability.</p>
<p>And this could be a kind of opening</p>
<p>for a kind of bipartisan conversation,</p>
<p>because if you are a kind of American militarist,</p>
<p>I mean, you have to look at the leadership</p>
<p>that got you to a place where you were defeated</p>
<p>by men wearing sandals firing AK 47s, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, there should be a humility with that.</p>
<p>I mean, we should actually say that,</p>
<p>like literally the&hellip;</p>
<p>Oh, we lost.</p>
<p>You should say we lost.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t just, you know&hellip;</p>
<p>The American military lost.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I feel I have very mixed feelings</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s, I don&rsquo;t know, a ton of veterans,</p>
<p>but Mitch and I have topped my share</p>
<p>and have a student now and they&rsquo;re suffering</p>
<p>because they look at the sacrifices that they made</p>
<p>that I didn&rsquo;t make.</p>
<p>I mean, American society didn&rsquo;t make the sacrifices.</p>
<p>I mean, men and women lost limbs,</p>
<p>they lost eyes, they lost lives.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s been this, of course, quiet epidemic of suicide</p>
<p>among veterans.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve heard some stories</p>
<p>the fact that the State Department</p>
<p>is seeing a similar surge of suicides</p>
<p>because they see their adult life&rsquo;s work collapse.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve seen their relationships.</p>
<p>I mean, they&rsquo;ve seen phone calls in the middle of the night</p>
<p>from people who they entrusted with their lives</p>
<p>who they know are gonna be targeted.</p>
<p>I mean, some of them have already been killed.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve seen the, I mean, I think just,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d imagine just ideologically and professionally</p>
<p>what they believed in and what they sacrificed for</p>
<p>has vanished.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s bad.</p>
<p>I mean, historically thinking of some of the precedents</p>
<p>you were thinking of, I mean, if you think of,</p>
<p>first of all, at a human level,</p>
<p>I feel horrible for those people who,</p>
<p>I may not have agreed with everything they had done</p>
<p>and their choices in life,</p>
<p>but I respect the fact that many good people</p>
<p>went out of the best intentions as young people</p>
<p>to do the right thing and make things right.</p>
<p>And I respect that.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve met enough to know that there were people</p>
<p>who saw the gray and complexity</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s all you can hope for.</p>
<p>But we don&rsquo;t want a generation of disillusioned veterans</p>
<p>if we look at the other postwar moments.</p>
<p>And this is kind of a postwar moment where,</p>
<p>I think we need a conversation with American veterans</p>
<p>about what they&rsquo;ve gone through and what they&rsquo;re feeling.</p>
<p>And they still have skin in the game</p>
<p>because their personal connections</p>
<p>and the end of their histories.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re also gonna be future leaders.</p>
<p>I mean, veterans.</p>
<p>People who have served are often great men and women.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>And throughout history,</p>
<p>whether you sacrifice you served in fighting World War II,</p>
<p>in fighting Vietnam,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to mold you in different ways.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s going to mold how you are as a leader</p>
<p>that leads this country forward.</p>
<p>And so you have to have an honest conversation</p>
<p>about what was the role of the war in Afghanistan,</p>
<p>the war in the Middle East,</p>
<p>the war on terror in the history of America.</p>
<p>If we just look at the full context</p>
<p>at the end of this 21st century,</p>
<p>how are we going to remember this</p>
<p>and how that&rsquo;s going to result in our future interactions</p>
<p>with small and large countries,</p>
<p>with China or some proxy war with China,</p>
<p>with Russia or some proxy war with Russia</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the role of oil and natural resources and opium</p>
<p>and all those kinds of things.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the role of military power in the world.</p>
<p>And now with COVID,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost like because of the many failures</p>
<p>of the US government and many leaders</p>
<p>in science and politics to respond effectively</p>
<p>and quickly to COVID,</p>
<p>we kind of forget that we fumbled this other thing too.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s hard to know which is going to be more expensive.</p>
<p>They seem to be symptoms of something</p>
<p>of a same kind of source problem of leadership,</p>
<p>of bureaucracy, of the way information</p>
<p>and intelligence flows throughout the US government.</p>
<p>All those kinds of things.</p>
<p>And that hopefully motivates young leaders to fix things.</p>
<p>Definitely, I mean, if there&rsquo;s one theme</p>
<p>that jumps out to me and thinking about this moment,</p>
<p>I mean, if we recognize that we live</p>
<p>in a kind of crisis of democracy in the United States</p>
<p>and in other countries that have long been proud</p>
<p>of their democratic traditions,</p>
<p>if we see them being under assault from certain quarters,</p>
<p>I think military defeat is yet another addition</p>
<p>to all the aspects of this that you mentioned.</p>
<p>I mean, the fact that military defeat is a giant match</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re throwing on this fire potentially,</p>
<p>if we think of its legacies</p>
<p>and other postwar environments,</p>
<p>when the veteran angle is one,</p>
<p>when you have people who feel betrayed,</p>
<p>I mean, they have been fodder</p>
<p>for the far right in other settings.</p>
<p>I mean, interwar Europe is very much</p>
<p>about mobilizing dissolution veterans</p>
<p>in the name of right wing fascist politics.</p>
<p>If one thinks too of this moment</p>
<p>of really increasing xenophobia,</p>
<p>our immigration debate is now talking about</p>
<p>whether or not Afghans should be permitted at all</p>
<p>in the United States after 20 years.</p>
<p>And I think immediately the response in Europe,</p>
<p>which I followed to some extent, focusing on Germany,</p>
<p>because it was really ramping up deportations of Afghans</p>
<p>leading up to this collapse.</p>
<p>And now they have been,</p>
<p>a lot of right wing center right politicians in Germany</p>
<p>have been watching all this with an eye to,</p>
<p>using it to their advantage for a domestic German audience</p>
<p>to say, in the context of recent elections,</p>
<p>that we are the party who will defend you</p>
<p>against these Afghans who are gonna be coming from this.</p>
<p>So what I&rsquo;ve tried to emphasize</p>
<p>in talking to different groups about this moment</p>
<p>is that it won&rsquo;t be confined to Afghanistan</p>
<p>or even the region.</p>
<p>I mean, obviously malnutrition, hunger</p>
<p>will send Afghans to neighboring states,</p>
<p>but where the European right is resurgent,</p>
<p>this has been a gift, right?</p>
<p>To say that the Afghans are coming,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re brown skinned, they&rsquo;re Muslim,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re uneducated, they&rsquo;re gonna want your women.</p>
<p>And they will take the odd sexual assault case</p>
<p>or the odd, whatever, dramatic act of violence</p>
<p>that happens numerically in any population.</p>
<p>And they will magnify that to say that,</p>
<p>our far right group is gonna save the nation.</p>
<p>And sorry, the main point I wanted to speak of leadership</p>
<p>was that I think the serial,</p>
<p>well, there were many, many carnal sins, if you like,</p>
<p>but if you go back to our analogy of all the exits,</p>
<p>I mean, what blocked some of those exits</p>
<p>was an absence of truth and transparency and the lying.</p>
<p>And so, I mean, this is no secret,</p>
<p>anyone who&rsquo;s followed this, but we&rsquo;ve allowed,</p>
<p>and you think of the general mistrust of government,</p>
<p>mistrust of authority across the board,</p>
<p>of professors, of economists, of scientists, doctors, right?</p>
<p>Well, I actually think that&rsquo;s the hopeful thing to me</p>
<p>about the internet is the internet hates inauthenticity.</p>
<p>They can smell bullshit much better.</p>
<p>And I think that motivates young leaders</p>
<p>to be transparent and authentic.</p>
<p>So like the very problems we&rsquo;ve been seeing,</p>
<p>this kind of attitude of authority where,</p>
<p>oh, the populace, they&rsquo;re too busy with their own lives.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not smart enough to understand</p>
<p>the full complexities of the things we&rsquo;re dealing with.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re not going to even communicate to them</p>
<p>the full complexities, we&rsquo;re just going to decide</p>
<p>and then tell them what we decided</p>
<p>and conceive some kind of narrative</p>
<p>that makes it easy for them to consume this decision.</p>
<p>As opposed to that, I really believe,</p>
<p>I see there&rsquo;s a hunger for authenticity</p>
<p>of when you&rsquo;re making decisions,</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re looking at the rest of the world</p>
<p>and trying to untangle this complexity, the internet,</p>
<p>the public, the world wants to see you as a leader struggle</p>
<p>with the tension of these ideas, to change your mind,</p>
<p>to recognize your own flaws</p>
<p>and your own thinking from a month ago, all that,</p>
<p>the full complexity of it,</p>
<p>also acknowledge the uncertainty as with COVID,</p>
<p>also with the wars, I think there&rsquo;s a hunger for that.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s just going to change the nature</p>
<p>of leadership in the 21st century.</p>
<p>I hope so.</p>
<p>I think all the things you&rsquo;ve highlighted,</p>
<p>accountability is part of that, right?</p>
<p>I mean, we need honesty, openness,</p>
<p>and then acknowledgement of mistakes.</p>
<p>Humility is the key to all learning, right?</p>
<p>But also, I mean, you think just the headline</p>
<p>from yesterday, the horrible drone strike,</p>
<p>which was really the last kind of American military action</p>
<p>on the day that the US was, I think,</p>
<p>mostly departing from Kabul,</p>
<p>wiped out an entire family, mostly children.</p>
<p>You know, the US acknowledged that, yes,</p>
<p>this was not the ISIS bombing outfit</p>
<p>that they thought it was.</p>
<p>But yesterday, they did a quick review.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not an expert on drone strikes in the aftermath,</p>
<p>but those who&rsquo;ve looked at it more closely said</p>
<p>it was basically whole cloth taken</p>
<p>from what the US government has been saying</p>
<p>after all these strikes, you know,</p>
<p>reproducing the same language</p>
<p>and basically pointing to technical errors,</p>
<p>but denying that there were any procedural mistakes</p>
<p>or flaws, or it was just kind of,</p>
<p>they found little ways of acknowledging</p>
<p>things did not go as planned,</p>
<p>but, you know, we follow the policies essentially,</p>
<p>and yeah, that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a crime.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a way of not even saying, you know, we screwed up.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s kind of the legal ease</p>
<p>that suddenly makes a war crime not a war crime, you know?</p>
<p>And that reflects, I think,</p>
<p>our refusal to take accountability.</p>
<p>I think people are really sick of that</p>
<p>in a way where the opposite is true,</p>
<p>which is they get excited for people who are not,</p>
<p>for leaders who are not that,</p>
<p>and so they&rsquo;re not going to punish you</p>
<p>for saying, I made a mistake.</p>
<p>I just had a conversation with Francis Collins,</p>
<p>the director of the NIH,</p>
<p>and part of my criticism towards Anthony Fauci</p>
<p>has been that it&rsquo;s such subtle,</p>
<p>but such crucial communication of mistakes made.</p>
<p>If you make a small mistake,</p>
<p>it is so powerful to communicate,</p>
<p>I think we messed up.</p>
<p>We thought this was true, and it wasn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>So the obvious thing there was with masks</p>
<p>early in the pandemic.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so much uncertainty.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so understandable to make mistakes</p>
<p>or to also be concerned about what kind of hysteria,</p>
<p>different statements you make lead to.</p>
<p>Just being transparent about that</p>
<p>and saying we were not correct</p>
<p>and saying the thing we said before.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s so powerful to communicate, to gain trust.</p>
<p>And the opposite is true.</p>
<p>When you do this legal ease type of talk,</p>
<p>it destroys trust.</p>
<p>And again, I really think the lessons of recent history</p>
<p>teach us how to be a leader</p>
<p>and teach young leaders how to be leaders.</p>
<p>And so I have a lot of hope.</p>
<p>Partially thanks for the internet.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, that&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>Oh, humility.</p>
<p>I mean, we need humility, accountability, honesty.</p>
<p>And yes, studying the past is an important way to do that.</p>
<p>I mean, to learn from past mistakes.</p>
<p>And obviously there&rsquo;s stories of inspiration and courage</p>
<p>and we can take some kind of assistance from that too.</p>
<p>But also learning from, learning how not to do things.</p>
<p>And then analogies are never like one to one.</p>
<p>I mean, we talk about Vietnam.</p>
<p>I mean, I think many Vietnam veterans would say,</p>
<p>yeah, this is like deja vu.</p>
<p>I mean, the story, the visuals of the Kabul airport</p>
<p>and of the Saigon embassy were not the same,</p>
<p>but close enough that people would juxtapose them.</p>
<p>All of this right now, but I would just ask people</p>
<p>that over analogizing is also a kind of path down</p>
<p>making errors of judgment and comparison,</p>
<p>and then sameness, but it&rsquo;s stretch.</p>
<p>I mean, like 9.11 itself,</p>
<p>I think the idea that people lack the imagination</p>
<p>within our security apparatus</p>
<p>to think this was even possible, right?</p>
<p>And you think of the simplicity of having a $10 lock</p>
<p>on a cockpit door, could have wanted all this.</p>
<p>And again, I&rsquo;m not saying either the time</p>
<p>or in hindsight that I am omniscient about all this,</p>
<p>but I had just been living in Germany the year before,</p>
<p>and there was a plot there.</p>
<p>This guy was hatching from Germany</p>
<p>to blow up the mausoleum of Attertwerk in Ankara</p>
<p>with an airplane.</p>
<p>And so if you kind of dig, it wasn&rsquo;t unimaginable</p>
<p>that you would use an airplane as a weapon.</p>
<p>And the Bush administration kept saying,</p>
<p>no one had ever heard of this.</p>
<p>Who would do this?</p>
<p>Like, well, not a lot of people do this.</p>
<p>And then at that very moment,</p>
<p>my wife was teaching the Joseph Conrad novel Secret Agent,</p>
<p>which was about a conspiratorial organization</p>
<p>that wanted to bomb,</p>
<p>actually in retrospect, it was kind of suicide bombing</p>
<p>because they tricked this guy into doing it,</p>
<p>but they wanted to bomb the Greenwich Observatory</p>
<p>for some obscure political purpose.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s an instance in which, you know, the novel,</p>
<p>right, to go back to our kind of humanities pitch, right,</p>
<p>that my point was that, you know,</p>
<p>as you mentioned, we need humanity, transparency,</p>
<p>but also imagination, right?</p>
<p>I think part of expanding our imagination is by, you know,</p>
<p>I mean, obviously delving into your fields, you know,</p>
<p>of engineering and the sciences and robotics</p>
<p>and artificial intelligence and all that rich landscape.</p>
<p>And then, but also we find this in film, poetry, literature,</p>
<p>I mean, just the kind of stretching that we need to do</p>
<p>to really educate ourselves more fully, right,</p>
<p>across the spectrum of everything humans need</p>
<p>to imagine, to reimagine security.</p>
<p>You know, so much of what we talked about today,</p>
<p>I mean, so much of, you know,</p>
<p>our security is affected by others perception</p>
<p>of their insecurity, right?</p>
<p>Which unleashes a whole web of emotions.</p>
<p>Can you tell me about the Afghan people,</p>
<p>what they love, what they fear,</p>
<p>what they dream of for themselves and for their nation?</p>
<p>Is there something to say,</p>
<p>to speak to to the spirit of the people</p>
<p>that may humanize them and maybe speak to the concerns</p>
<p>and the hopes they have?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think I, you know, as an outsider,</p>
<p>I hesitate to make any grand statement,</p>
<p>but I would say, listen, I mean,</p>
<p>there are a number of documentary films</p>
<p>that are incredibly rich</p>
<p>that will offer your listeners and viewers a snapshot.</p>
<p>So there is Afghan Star, you know,</p>
<p>which really brings you in the homes of a set of people</p>
<p>who, you know, they want stardom, they&rsquo;re artists,</p>
<p>they want to express themselves.</p>
<p>Some want to push political boundaries, cultural boundaries.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a woman who gets into hot water for dancing.</p>
<p>But yeah, you realize that, I mean, people,</p>
<p>I mean, they love art, they love music,</p>
<p>they love poetry, they love expression.</p>
<p>You know, people want to care for their children.</p>
<p>They want safety of their families.</p>
<p>They want to enjoy what everyone enjoys, you know?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a very humanizing portrait.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s another great documentary film</p>
<p>called Love Crimes of Kabul,</p>
<p>which is a great snapshot of the post 2000 world</p>
<p>that the Americans shaped a lot of ways.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s about a women&rsquo;s prison.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s incredibly revealing</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s about young girls and what they want.</p>
<p>Well, not just young, but young, teenage,</p>
<p>and then some middle aged people</p>
<p>who are accused of moral crimes,</p>
<p>ranging from homicide, which one woman admits to,</p>
<p>to having sexual relations outside of marriage.</p>
<p>And so it shows in a way continuity</p>
<p>with the previous Taliban regime</p>
<p>and that women are in prison</p>
<p>for things that you wouldn&rsquo;t be in prison for elsewhere,</p>
<p>and that Islamic law operates as the kind of judicial logic</p>
<p>for these punishments.</p>
<p>But letting these women kind of speak for themselves,</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t want to get too much away,</p>
<p>but women make very interesting choices in this film</p>
<p>that land them in this predicament.</p>
<p>So they don&rsquo;t all profess innocence.</p>
<p>Some are like, I&rsquo;m guilty, but they&rsquo;re guilty for reasons.</p>
<p>In one case, one woman is guilty, she&rsquo;s in prison</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a way to exert pressure on her fiancee</p>
<p>to finally marry her, you know?</p>
<p>So you get ethnicity, you get like, you know,</p>
<p>kind of Romeo and Juliet things</p>
<p>where their families don&rsquo;t like each other necessarily,</p>
<p>but they find each other.</p>
<p>You have questions of like, love, money, clothing,</p>
<p>furniture, it&rsquo;s beautiful.</p>
<p>And like, I mean, the parts with it,</p>
<p>I remember showing it in class,</p>
<p>there was a wonderful Afghan student who was a,</p>
<p>I think a Fulbright at the ed school at Stanford,</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s a genius, she&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>It was awkward for her because talking about young women</p>
<p>having sex and stuff, and it was just, it wasn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>you know, the snapshot of Afghanistan that she wanted.</p>
<p>And obviously there&rsquo;s so much more,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re great writers and, you know, musicians.</p>
<p>And I mean, you know, music is a huge thing.</p>
<p>I mean, poetry, all those things are great.</p>
<p>So she found it, you know, I hear you.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s kind of a taboo subject,</p>
<p>but I thought the American students seeing it</p>
<p>really identified with these women</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re just so real.</p>
<p>And so, you know, young people trying to find like,</p>
<p>I mean, relationships that are universal</p>
<p>and circumstances that are very difficult.</p>
<p>Love, love is universal.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, so it&rsquo;s, I mean,</p>
<p>we do have resources to humanize.</p>
<p>I mean, you know, some of your people will know</p>
<p>Khaled Hosseini, you know, he&rsquo;s an African American,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s done his stuff, but there are,</p>
<p>there are a number of novelists and short story writers</p>
<p>who do cool things.</p>
<p>I think that another tragic aspect of this moment</p>
<p>is that those people have now pretty much</p>
<p>had to leave the country.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a visual artist I would highlight for you</p>
<p>named Khadem Ali, who&rsquo;s a Hazara based in Australia.</p>
<p>He does extraordinary work in blending a tradition</p>
<p>of Persian miniatures with contemporary political commentary.</p>
<p>His work is between Australia and Afghanistan,</p>
<p>but he also, he had to flee.</p>
<p>I mean, he was doing some work in Kabul,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a extraordinary kind of visual language</p>
<p>that he&rsquo;s adopted that has been shown all over the planet now.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s got some of his work is in New York galleries,</p>
<p>is in Europe.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s been shown in Australia,</p>
<p>but he talks about migration in a way</p>
<p>that puts Afghans and Hazaras at the center,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s totally universal about, you know,</p>
<p>our modern crisis of all the mains people</p>
<p>who were displaced across our planet.</p>
<p>And he attempts to kind of speak for some size of them</p>
<p>in a way that like everyone can get.</p>
<p>I mean, the visual imagery experts will know</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s from, you know, like the Shah Naam,</p>
<p>like an ancient Persian epic that Iranians were attached to,</p>
<p>that Afghans are attached to, that people can quote,</p>
<p>you know, at length, that has mythical figures</p>
<p>of good and evil that kids grow up embodying.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re named the names of the characters that are,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s called, you know, the Book of Kings.</p>
<p>The heroes and villains are the staple</p>
<p>of conversation and poetry and, you know, like Russians,</p>
<p>I mean, the kind of, the resort to literary references</p>
<p>and speak is something that, you know,</p>
<p>Americans don&rsquo;t do, most West European countries don&rsquo;t do,</p>
<p>but the fact that everyone&rsquo;s got to know this character,</p>
<p>everyone knows this reference,</p>
<p>the wordplay, the linguistic finesse in multiple languages</p>
<p>is, you know, a major value of Afghan storytelling.</p>
<p>As an outsider, I&rsquo;m scratching at the surface of the surface.</p>
<p>Yeah, but there&rsquo;s a depth to it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like, it is fascinating.</p>
<p>With the layers, yeah.</p>
<p>With the layers of Russian language that&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>The culture, it&rsquo;s a, I&rsquo;ve been struggling,</p>
<p>and this is kind of the journey I&rsquo;m embarking on</p>
<p>to convey to an American audience</p>
<p>what is lost in translation between Russian and English.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s very challenging in some of the great translators</p>
<p>of Dostoevsky, of Tolstoy, of Russian literature,</p>
<p>struggle with this deeply.</p>
<p>And they work, it&rsquo;s an art form just to convey that.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s amazing to hear that Afghanistan,</p>
<p>with a full mix of cultures that are there,</p>
<p>have the same kind of wit and humor and depth of intellect.</p>
<p>I mean, the humor thing is, that&rsquo;s, you know,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so much of our visual imagery</p>
<p>is about like this sad place in Dower or whatever,</p>
<p>but the, I mean, socially, again,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna engage in some stereotypes</p>
<p>about generalization stuff, but just the,</p>
<p>you know, the Afghan friends that I&rsquo;ve come to</p>
<p>be close with and really love, I mean, the humor,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so much there of common stuff of like,</p>
<p>when I go to Ireland, it&rsquo;s one of my favorite places</p>
<p>and just like the, I feel a sense of pressure,</p>
<p>like the humor all around me at the time.</p>
<p>I mean, I feel like there&rsquo;s something between Ireland</p>
<p>and Russia with the humor stuff where it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve gotta be on your game if you wanna be, you know,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s, yeah, I feel like the intensity of conversation</p>
<p>in terms of, yeah, you have to be on your game</p>
<p>in terms of wit and so on.</p>
<p>I mean, you have to, there&rsquo;s certain people I have,</p>
<p>like when I talk on this podcast,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re like that, certain people from the Jewish tradition</p>
<p>have that, like where the wit is just like,</p>
<p>okay, I have to, oh yeah, I really have to pay attention.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a game, it&rsquo;s like, you know what it feels like?</p>
<p>It feels like speed chess or something like that</p>
<p>and you really have to focus and play</p>
<p>and at the same time, there&rsquo;s body language in the,</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s a melancholy nature to it,</p>
<p>at least in the Russian side.</p>
<p>The whole thing is just a beautiful mess.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, there&rsquo;s a funny TikTok video</p>
<p>that went around that I got from like some Afghan</p>
<p>acquaintances that was a, that he&rsquo;s an Irish comedian</p>
<p>kind of highlighting, you know,</p>
<p>kind of Irish and German national stereotypes</p>
<p>around hospitality.</p>
<p>And this Afghan woman said, you know,</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know that the Irish were just white Afghans</p>
<p>because the whole, like, you know, the hospitality,</p>
<p>like politics of like, of refusal.</p>
<p>You know, you don&rsquo;t take something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s offered to you the first time.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t, I mean, it&rsquo;s the culture of receiving a guest.</p>
<p>You know, that&rsquo;s, you know, Americans aren&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s not, you know, that&rsquo;s not always,</p>
<p>I mean, the different, the regional cultures</p>
<p>where that&rsquo;s the thing, there&rsquo;s whatever,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s, I mean, the kind of like generosity</p>
<p>and the kind of, you know, that&rsquo;s real.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s, and that&rsquo;s a cool thing.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s, you know, the food, I mean, going off</p>
<p>just the superficial things, but all of that,</p>
<p>the warmth of hospitality and of wit and humanity.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s what we don&rsquo;t see viewing the place</p>
<p>just through war and geopolitics</p>
<p>and the moving pieces of the map and stuff.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s hard to see when, you know,</p>
<p>there are gaps in language and in religious tradition</p>
<p>and all that stuff.</p>
<p>And then, you know, being open to the fact</p>
<p>that people do things differently, you know,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s, and the gender dimension there is important,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re kind of, you know, arguably each culture</p>
<p>has a kind of gender dynamic that&rsquo;s different.</p>
<p>And so I think it&rsquo;s helpful to have humility</p>
<p>in thinking that some Afghans</p>
<p>will do some things differently, you know.</p>
<p>But then you&rsquo;ll also have Afghans who say,</p>
<p>every woman should be educated.</p>
<p>Everyone should work and so on and so on.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s no, there&rsquo;s no single way of, yeah.</p>
<p>And there is a gender dynamic in Russia too.</p>
<p>We need to be respectful of that.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not always what it looks like at first.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s layers.</p>
<p>Where power is.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s definitely, I don&rsquo;t know, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s a whole nother conversation</p>
<p>where the power is.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Rumi, the 13th century Persian poet</p>
<p>who was born on the land that is now Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Is there something in his words that speaks to you</p>
<p>about the spirit of the Afghan people?</p>
<p>I mean, everyone owns Rumi, I guess I&rsquo;d say.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s gonna get me in trouble</p>
<p>with certain Afghan fans of Rumi</p>
<p>who wanna see him as an Afghan.</p>
<p>I would say.</p>
<p>Are they proud of Rumi?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Do they see him as an Afghan?</p>
<p>Do they?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, it depends.</p>
<p>I mean, some people will be militant and say,</p>
<p>you know, the Iranian&rsquo;s gonna have him.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s ours.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;ll also say, you know, he&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>I mean, you can say, I mean, again,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like a Rorschach blot.</p>
<p>I mean, he&rsquo;s a Sufi, he&rsquo;s a Muslim,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a Central Asian, he&rsquo;s Iranian, he&rsquo;s Afghan,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a Turk.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to think of the analogy,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;s something special to everyone.</p>
<p>So I guess I would not walk into that conversation</p>
<p>and claim that he&rsquo;s one or another,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a cool thing.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s the, but I&rsquo;m glad you brought that up</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s a good way of seeing something that Afghans,</p>
<p>I mean, we live in our country in Afghanistan</p>
<p>and say, okay, Rumi&rsquo;s everyone, you know,</p>
<p>Madonna helped make him famous in the United States,</p>
<p>you know, for better, for worse.</p>
<p>They used to sell stuff at Starbucks</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s all complicated and embarrassing.</p>
<p>And his translations are very much disputed</p>
<p>where you have people be like,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some awful Rumi translations.</p>
<p>And there are, there are also a lot of,</p>
<p>speaking of the internet,</p>
<p>there are lots of fake Rumi quotes, you know,</p>
<p>like Rumi said, always be your best.</p>
<p>Like, Rumi didn&rsquo;t say that, you know, that was, you know,</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s kind of slow stuff like that.</p>
<p>But the cool thing is like, I mean,</p>
<p>I think you can read Rumi as a religious thinker,</p>
<p>but you can also, you know, read Rumi as,</p>
<p>you know, in an Islamic sense,</p>
<p>but you can also read him as a kind of spiritualist, right?</p>
<p>As someone who, or an ethicist or moralist.</p>
<p>And so I think that&rsquo;s, I like the lens of Rumi</p>
<p>as a gateway to Afghan ecumenism and cosmolitanism.</p>
<p>You know, the theme I keep emphasizing of,</p>
<p>of meeting actual Afghans who were actually,</p>
<p>you know, fluent in Russian, fluent in German,</p>
<p>fluent in Turkish, they know Dari, they know Pashto.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve gone to university or sometimes they haven&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And yet, I mean, they are,</p>
<p>I like the category of the popular intellectual,</p>
<p>you know, the intellectual who isn&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t formally educated necessarily.</p>
<p>Although of course that&rsquo;s represented too,</p>
<p>especially increasingly now with the generation</p>
<p>of going to university all over the world,</p>
<p>you know, Stanford, MIT, everywhere.</p>
<p>Afghans are well represented there.</p>
<p>But just being, I don&rsquo;t have any kind of worldly knowledge</p>
<p>that is not limited to a province, to a village, to a hamlet.</p>
<p>But sometimes it is, but sometimes it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>Because of, again, not because of some fairy tale story</p>
<p>of curiosity wandering the globe out of, you know,</p>
<p>some sense of privilege, but out of necessity,</p>
<p>out of survival of having to adapt.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s really extraordinary that, I mean,</p>
<p>also let me think about like professions,</p>
<p>so like, you know, ask an Afghan, you know,</p>
<p>what does he or she do for a living?</p>
<p>And what have they done in the past?</p>
<p>I mean, the answers one gets,</p>
<p>shoe salesman, task cop drivers, surgeons, all in one guy.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s not just Afghan,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s, you know, that&rsquo;s very common.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s also Russia is the same.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s whenever there&rsquo;s complexities</p>
<p>to the economic system and the short term</p>
<p>and the long term history of how the country develops.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s basically the people figuring out their way</p>
<p>around a mess of a country politically,</p>
<p>but a beautiful, flourishing culture and humanity.</p>
<p>And that creates super interesting people.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>So we can often see, okay, there&rsquo;s Taliban, there&rsquo;s war,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s economic malfunction,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s harboring of terrorists, there&rsquo;s opium trade,</p>
<p>all that kind of stuff, but there&rsquo;s humans there</p>
<p>with deep intellectual lies.</p>
<p>And like, I love the movie, Love Crimes.</p>
<p>And the same kind of hopes, fears, and desire to love</p>
<p>the old Romeo and Juliet story.</p>
<p>And I think Rumi to me represents that.</p>
<p>The wit, the intelligence, but also the just eloquent</p>
<p>and just beautiful representation of humanity of love.</p>
<p>Some of the best quotes about love are from him,</p>
<p>half of them fake, half of them real, but.</p>
<p>The best ones are real, right?</p>
<p>The best ones are real, the best ones are real.</p>
<p>Robert, this was an incredible conversation.</p>
<p>Oh, thank you for having us.</p>
<p>Thank you for the tour of Afghanistan</p>
<p>and making me, making us realize that there&rsquo;s much more</p>
<p>to this country than what we may think.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a beautiful country and it&rsquo;s full of beautiful people.</p>
<p>You made me think about a lot of new things too,</p>
<p>so it was definitely, definitely great online too,</p>
<p>so thank you so much.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation</p>
<p>with Robert Cruz.</p>
