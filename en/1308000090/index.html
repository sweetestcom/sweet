    <p>We&rsquo;re really excited to have our next speaker here. Nate silver is the editor-in-chief of 538</p>
<p>and he</p>
<p>Came to our poker game recently. Oh Nate came to our game. Come on out Nate ran the game over</p>
<p>Who was the big who&rsquo;s the big loser that night?</p>
<p>I think wait who was the big loser cuz Nate was the big winner, right? Well, I he was the big winner</p>
<p>I was basically trying to think Jason&rsquo;s here just kind of a loser that night. I think I don&rsquo;t donated a little bit to Nate</p>
<p>Silver&rsquo;s new</p>
<p>Model a lot of why but model is fun. I think you got the model is flat coming to the game</p>
<p>This was the largest poker when you&rsquo;ve had in your life largest cash game win. Yeah by a factor of five</p>
<p>To two. Okay. Yeah. Well, we&rsquo;re happy to donate you&rsquo;re getting by the way your speaker fee. I just canceled it</p>
<p>Okay, but ladies and gentlemen Nate silver on the mind of a gambler</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really excited to talk to you all today</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m working on a book about gambling risk and rationality. I prefer the term critical thinking to rationality</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s partly involved talking to people about global societal risks</p>
<p>So talking to people about the risk of nuclear war, which is like not very cheery conversations, by the way</p>
<p>But also people who take risk for a living or at the very least</p>
<p>Manage risk and have real skin in the game and not just some actuary getting a salary there</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re assessing risk and making big decisions financially mostly based on on that assessment</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve started out talking to poker players and sports bettors. I&rsquo;m a former poker player myself. I still play recreationally a lot</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m currently I think number 301 in the global poker rankings. Not that I looked it up every morning</p>
<p>But mostly it&rsquo;s the examples of talking to other</p>
<p>Fantastic poker players and sports bettors about their process and I&rsquo;m also talking now more to VCS</p>
<p>To founders to hedge fund managers, for example</p>
<p>There are a lot of similarities. There&rsquo;s a certain type of person that&rsquo;s been talking about today</p>
<p>Personality traits modes of thinking it even affects maybe their political views a little bit and you see a lot of things in common</p>
<p>So I gave you some of this context already this is a work in progress</p>
<p>I mean the book is kind of halfway 0% written about 50% research. So things may change. I&rsquo;m evolving and learning and correcting things</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s fun to write a book</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fun to have great conversations with the besties and other people and really kind of experience this firsthand</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m going to start with some things that I think are relatively straightforward and obvious</p>
<p>And then get into things that are maybe less so toward the end</p>
<p>But one really obvious one is that successful gamblers think probabilistically. It&rsquo;s not just a matter of</p>
<p>understanding probability but being</p>
<p>comfortable with</p>
<p>Uncertainty, being willing to take bets on an uncertain basis. That&rsquo;s kind of table stakes for even getting into any field involving risk</p>
<p>In poker at least you probably also need a fair amount of mathematical ability</p>
<p>There are now these things called solvers in poker that come up with a game theory optimal strategy for every situation</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very complex situation. It&rsquo;s way too hard to memorize. You have to kind of develop a mathematical intuition behind it</p>
<p>But even players with rare exception Phil Hellmuth might be the one exception actually, right</p>
<p>but even players who are known as being field players or</p>
<p>Exploitative players people who rely on tells and psychology and table talk</p>
<p>I talked to Daniel Negreanu, for example, one of the probably five best poker players of all time</p>
<p>And he told me that about four years ago</p>
<p>He realized that these solver kids as he calls them the math whizzes were</p>
<p>Were better than him at least at certain forms of poker and he totally remade his game to look at computer solutions</p>
<p>To be more studious and mathematical and it&rsquo;s improved his results quite a bit</p>
<p>In the VC field, I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;re necessarily doing as much modeling as I might in election model, for example</p>
<p>But at the very least people understand the intuition and the intuition is you need both</p>
<p>But I think the intuition is more important than the in the application</p>
<p>Number two this one ought to be really obvious</p>
<p>But it needs to be said successful gamblers are highly competitive things that you hear from people</p>
<p>Over and over again is I want to kind of prove people wrong. I want to outsmart the competition</p>
<p>I want to show who&rsquo;s best. It&rsquo;s almost more of this motivation than financial motivation, I think</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s partly a matter of you can&rsquo;t settle for being average as a gambler the average poker player loses money to the house</p>
<p>So does the average sports better? So therefore you have to deviate from average in some ways</p>
<p>But kind of one conclusion I&rsquo;ve come to talking to people this book is that human beings are our</p>
<p>Competitive species right to get people to get along in society is pretty hard</p>
<p>You know one good thing about capitalism is that you have some managed type of competition</p>
<p>Democracy is kind of a type of competition and that&rsquo;s probably a better way to kind of challenge these conflicting urges we have</p>
<p>Than things that are too centrally planned</p>
<p>But certainly people in this room people I talked to are on the high end of the competitive scale</p>
<p>Successful poker players and sports bettors have to care a lot about small edges</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the nature of placing bets in the field where you lose money on average</p>
<p>So a very good sports better might win 55 or so percent of his or her bets</p>
<p>You have to win 52 and a half percent to make up for the house cut for the rake or the big as different names</p>
<p>That means you can&rsquo;t afford to make 1% errors, right?</p>
<p>You really have to squeeze every last drop of expected value or EV out of any situation that you&rsquo;re in</p>
<p>This makes people very very very detail oriented poker players tend to be very studious about their craft</p>
<p>They really kind of love poker. You can&rsquo;t just get the big things right in poker</p>
<p>You have to get the small things right too. It&rsquo;s too competitive a field right now</p>
<p>This might not be as true by the way of</p>
<p>VC</p>
<p>The average investment makes money it may not make a above-market return</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;ll make money which is not true for the average poker hand that you play</p>
<p>By the way casinos too if you talk to casino executives</p>
<p>You might think you walk into a casino and everything that you do is maximized to them to make the maximum amount of revenue possible</p>
<p>Not really, right? They&rsquo;re pretty good at the big stuff. They protect their downside risk a lot</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re not maximized as much as you would think because when you have like a license to make money</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to get the small stuff, right?</p>
<p>But in poker where only 10% of players probably make money in the long run you have to be very very detail oriented</p>
<p>Number four you see here a Paul Graham thread about Elon actually</p>
<p>Successful gamblers are contrarian at least to some degree and again</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m kind of repeating myself a little bit</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s no edge if someone if everyone does the same thing in the same way</p>
<p>You have to have some angle that you think makes you better than what the market thinks and the markets pretty good</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a hard thing to manage</p>
<p>I think risk takers tend to view themselves as</p>
<p>Outsiders whether they are or not is probably an open question</p>
<p>What they think of themselves is thinking differently from the rest of the world potentially</p>
<p>this can also make them potentially like a little bit annoying like outside of investing and</p>
<p>Gambling context right where if you&rsquo;re kind of always the person who says well actually</p>
<p>That can get kind of pushed back in social settings for example or on Twitter</p>
<p>But you can&rsquo;t kind of settle for having the average view because the average view doesn&rsquo;t do better than than the market</p>
<p>There is a fine line between being ahead of the curve and a permanent contrarian</p>
<p>In sports betting if there&rsquo;s a line that&rsquo;s constantly mispriced then I can just bet that I don&rsquo;t want that</p>
<p>Market to correct itself. I want to keep exploiting that error in pricing right in</p>
<p>VC I mean you might want to find a founder or a sector or a company</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s undervalued by the market, but eventually you want that sector to grow you want to attract more talent</p>
<p>you want to attract future fundraising rounds, so you kind of are more being ahead of the curve by</p>
<p>By half a year to a year. I think in some ways. It&rsquo;s analogous to real estate</p>
<p>We are trying to kind of anticipate where the market will be in the future</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a subtly different skill than being maybe contrarian per se</p>
<p>But related at least</p>
<p>Number five and again this might be a little bit redundant, but successful gamblers</p>
<p>Take shots, and this is very intuitive in VC where you have a field where you might</p>
<p>Might only have a unicorn or decacorn. You know 1% of the time or 10% of the time of course</p>
<p>You have a whole portfolio. It may not be that risky in the aggregate</p>
<p>But you have to be willing to make</p>
<p>Decisions under under pressure and be somewhat fearless as a result right timing is important</p>
<p>You want to be first to market in poker you have a finite amount of time you can spend on a hand in practice</p>
<p>Sometimes people take these risks in a calculated way right I talked to</p>
<p>Sam Beckman Fried for the book for example</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s like yeah, I knew this would have like it only a 50% chance of succeeding</p>
<p>But the payoff was so high I would take it</p>
<p>Some people just kind of more intuitively just kind of want to put skin in the game</p>
<p>Want to take risk get some excitement or pleasure from it again. We&rsquo;re talking about the very extreme</p>
<p>Tales here, too, right?</p>
<p>The people who are super uber successful</p>
<p>Maybe are almost taking on more risk than they maybe should you can instead like we have a very</p>
<p>Happy and complacent life as an investment banker or something, but people who are true</p>
<p>Entrepreneurs, I think at scale and think and think very very big</p>
<p>I should say one challenge of writing the book is that talking only to successful people you risk survivorship bias, right?</p>
<p>So kind of which people fell along by the wayside if you know unsuccessful</p>
<p>Investors or gamblers then then send them my way. I need to talk to some of them as well</p>
<p>Number six successful gamblers especially in poker work well with incomplete information</p>
<p>One thing that differentiates kind of people in academia and academia is very useful for basic research and for advancing science and things like that</p>
<p>Right, but like but you don&rsquo;t get months and months and years and years to develop a hypothesis</p>
<p>When there&rsquo;s actual money on the line by that time the people who were faster will already have moved</p>
<p>So the skill is kind of knowing what information was available at the time you made the decision</p>
<p>I think there is a limit to how useful like an after-action review might be if you kind of</p>
<p>Pretend as though you had perfect hindsight, right?</p>
<p>We can say what would we have done about COVID now if we had known a lot of things we know now about it back</p>
<p>In February 2020 and it would be an easier problem to solve but like that&rsquo;s not how the real world works</p>
<p>So decision-making under uncertainty is I think a understudied and under appreciate</p>
<p>appreciated topic</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t be too much of a control freak certainly in a game like poker</p>
<p>You can lose your temper very easily emotional management&rsquo;s a big part of people who are successful in these fields</p>
<p>But you know all the value is in making the hard decisions, right?</p>
<p>hard because they&rsquo;re edge cases hard because</p>
<p>You have some information but not others and you&rsquo;re gonna get some things wrong</p>
<p>But otherwise if it&rsquo;s easy, then everyone else is already gonna do it. There&rsquo;s no excess returns to be made. I</p>
<p>Think related to this is that successful gamblers focus on process much more than results</p>
<p>One thing I found good for the book and refreshing is people if you ask them kind of what makes you tick?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your advantage? They&rsquo;re quite thoughtful and deliberate about it. They step back and think about what skills do I possess?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the bigger kind of problem that I&rsquo;m trying to solve?</p>
<p>Again emotional displacement is a big part of this. I&rsquo;m not saying that you&rsquo;re supposed to be totally</p>
<p>Emotionless, I mean emotion can help to guide intuition much to talk about in a bit</p>
<p>But it does mean you have to be willing to like lose poker hand lose</p>
<p>10,000 bucks and then play the next hand as best as you can right or have an investment or many investments that go sour</p>
<p>And still be on your kind of best state of mind for making future investments</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty hard</p>
<p>Most people aren&rsquo;t very good at this at all</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t go too far and sometimes make excuses. There are lots of different ways to get unlucky in poker or investing</p>
<p>But having that focus on kind of what was my thought process?</p>
<p>It seems intuitive people in this audience, maybe but it&rsquo;s not intuitive for the average person a different</p>
<p>Differentiates successful gamblers quite a bit</p>
<p>This next slide here you may have seen this video online</p>
<p>Where there are a bunch of girls bouncing basketballs they ask you to count how many times the basketball passed back and forth</p>
<p>and during the video kind of unbeknownst to the watcher a</p>
<p>Gorilla walks on stage like things change colors weird things happen. And the point is to try and say okay. Well you were so focused on</p>
<p>Counting number of basketballs being passed that you ignored the gorilla in the room so to speak, right?</p>
<p>I think though that if you&rsquo;re instructed to count the number of passes that it actually a sign of intelligence that you do focus on</p>
<p>That right if you&rsquo;re an air traffic controller</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re trying to like land planes at Miami Airport and you get a bunch of text messages from your teenage daughter, right?</p>
<p>You shouldn&rsquo;t be distracted by that. You should kind of focus on the task at hand</p>
<p>But the point is that people have an amazing ability to vary what they were paying attention to</p>
<p>Especially in the moment and in poker&rsquo;s is very important because most of the time poker is pretty boring, right?</p>
<p>good players fold</p>
<p>70% of their hands for the most part right a lot of decisions are fairly automatic</p>
<p>But maybe once an hour or once a day you&rsquo;ll have a decision</p>
<p>For tens of thousands of dollars or where you&rsquo;ll be knocked out of the tournament or win the tournament, right?</p>
<p>and so having that kind of</p>
<p>Knowing where you focus your attention is an underrated skill that I think people who are at least in poker are pretty good at</p>
<p>by the way</p>
<p>One thing I&rsquo;ve noticed is that you used to kind of think of poker players as being kind of quite</p>
<p>Shlubby and sloppy and some of them still are but more and more the good players are focusing on physical and mental illness</p>
<p>fitness, it is like a</p>
<p>Demanding game. It&rsquo;s a little bit demanding physically to kind of keep your composure</p>
<p>And not give away information from your from your mental state and to really concentrate is like actually a lot of work</p>
<p>I mean the kind of famous studies of chess players and how Magnus Carlsen will lose</p>
<p>You know five pounds over the course of a chess match just thinking which might seem ridiculous. But like but if you&rsquo;re really playing</p>
<p>Poker at your a game at your a plus game, which you don&rsquo;t achieve very often</p>
<p>I often find that when I am able to do that rarely I&rsquo;m completely wiped out afterward</p>
<p>It is a physically demanding game</p>
<p>But in general kind of being having your ear to the ground looking out for</p>
<p>Opportunities and being flexible enough to take advantage of those opportunities is a underrated skill set</p>
<p>Number nine</p>
<p>successful gamblers apply practiced intuition, so</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m 44 one of the things about becoming middle-aged you start to kind of</p>
<p>Potentially trust your gut a lot more which can be which can be risky in some ways</p>
<p>I think people can in matters that happen only occasionally like a presidential election people think well</p>
<p>My gut is that so and so will win</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have enough practice at forecasting elections to really for that to be very useful, right?</p>
<p>We have one election every four years</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a poker player though, you&rsquo;re playing tens of thousands of hands every year</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a VC, you&rsquo;re hearing thousands of pitches every year, right?</p>
<p>And part of what experience does is kind of take things that were once hard and then become more automatic, right?</p>
<p>I mean, you&rsquo;ll hear people say oh I made a decision</p>
<p>Very quickly, right and I make staff decisions you hear someone give a pitch</p>
<p>And you decide maybe in 30 minutes whether or not to fund them or not. You hear examples like that</p>
<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t really reflect the fact that this person has spent years and years and years</p>
<p>Honing their insight and listening to pitches and that that produces value down the line</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s intuition of a sort, but it&rsquo;s practiced refined well calibrated intuition that involves working really hard and and learning, right?</p>
<p>I mean in poker you kind of go through cycles where</p>
<p>Where you kind of are grinding and get better at something you feel like you achieve some condition of mastery</p>
<p>Then you kind of slip you get complacent. Maybe you tilt a little bit</p>
<p>Having the ability to like step back and re-evaluate</p>
<p>Your game like Negreanu or someone and say look I have to make some adjustments here</p>
<p>Maybe I&rsquo;m doing play barely ever have but now I learn different flaws that I have right my opponents are getting better, too</p>
<p>That bottom of this chart here</p>
<p>We re-evaluate and grind back up and expect that you&rsquo;re gonna have to keep doing that for your whole life, frankly</p>
<p>Differentiate successful people I think</p>
<p>Number ten, this is one of the more subtle ones I think but successful gamblers are</p>
<p>Structured thinkers they want to understand the process behind the outcome again in poker. It&rsquo;s too complex a game</p>
<p>Just to purely learn through memorization and wrote skill, right?</p>
<p>You want to understand how things adapt what the underlying kind of curvatures are and everything</p>
<p>Heuristics or rules of thumb are are pretty useful, right?</p>
<p>Like in poker a heuristic might be that you should call with your medium-strength hands, right? Your best hands you raise</p>
<p>Your worst hands you fold or check right and then you kind of call with your medium-strength hands</p>
<p>But there are exceptions to that and heuristics only go so far</p>
<p>But the kind of flip side of this is like so at this conference. There&rsquo;s a lot of talk about</p>
<p>Investing and gambling but also politics. I do think when you&rsquo;re kind of a highly structured</p>
<p>philosophical thinker</p>
<p>That politics is very frustrating right people in the other world. I work in which is I you know, I run a website</p>
<p>I talk to people in politics talk to academics who are trying to get on see it TV and stuff like that, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a lot of very hypocritical and ad-hoc thinking in politics, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s instrumental reasoning toward trying to win an argument at that moment in that day and so you can see why someone</p>
<p>Like Elon Musk might get very fed up with the kind of hypocritical nature of political discourse. That&rsquo;s another conversation</p>
<p>We might have in the Q&amp;A, but but it does lead to some personality clashes, I think</p>
<p>The last one here which is maybe a little bit counterintuitive</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ve kind of learned I think from observation is that the most successful gamblers don&rsquo;t actually care that much about money</p>
<p>You know, they tend to be for the most part very generous. They&rsquo;re always gonna pick up the tab</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re gonna spend a lot on good wine and things like that, right?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re in it really for the love of the game and when they get bored, they tend to quit</p>
<p>Again, this might differentiate the 0.01</p>
<p>Percent or 0.001 percent from like the 1%</p>
<p>Certainly you want to manage your money carefully in poker</p>
<p>But still when you have people whose net worth</p>
<p>Fluctuates by the amount that poker players does like in poker is basically like, you know</p>
<p>Three states right super rich somewhat rich and dead broke like not a lot in between</p>
<p>When that&rsquo;s the nature of your field and you&rsquo;ve been in those states for different parts of your life and many good poker players have</p>
<p>Had periods where they&rsquo;re broke you tend to recognize the ephemeral nature of success and to celebrate life in the moment a bit more so</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all. Thank you very much. Look forward to the Q&amp;A now</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, Nate Silver. I don&rsquo;t know if there was this in the introduction that you run 538 like does everyone know the site?</p>
<p>So like during the election cycle</p>
<p>Nate does the best job of anyone on earth</p>
<p>gathering together polling data and then using statistical models to represent a</p>
<p>Distribution or a set of expected outcomes and making that known on his site in a way that super I think informative better than anything else</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s out there. So thanks for that. Now. I get really addicted to them leading up to elections</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, I got to go in and check what Nate&rsquo;s changed on the site every day</p>
<p>And I know a lot of people did</p>
<p>Then what I observed on Twitter, which I think speaks to your first point here</p>
<p>Was a lot of people followed your prediction on the Trump election, right and they&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>Nate made a prediction that Trump was going to win</p>
<p>but what you said was that there was a</p>
<p>43% chance that Trump would win and therefore people assumed he was going to lose and</p>
<p>That the nature of a lot of people&rsquo;s understanding of things is very deterministic and binary</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like win or lose as opposed to hey, the future is not</p>
<p>Binary the future is not deterministic</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s a set of outcomes that may occur and you can get a better sense of what that set is</p>
<p>You make that determination enough times. You&rsquo;ll you&rsquo;ll be right most of the time. You&rsquo;ll be wrong some of the time</p>
<p>Do you think most it&rsquo;s my question for you based on how I saw people react negatively?</p>
<p>Yeah to your polling which was crazy because it was like dude he gave a really good set of statistical models</p>
<p>No people blamed you but</p>
<p>But my question is like do people have the ability to think probabilistically because you say you need to think probabilistically</p>
<p>Or is that a minority of people that can really get themselves there because so many people just want a yes-or-no answer</p>
<p>They want to say this is the future this isn&rsquo;t they don&rsquo;t want to think about a distribution of outcomes</p>
<p>Which is really the way the world works</p>
<p>I mean, I think people think probabilistically all the time in real life, right?</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re like running late for a meeting you have to decide should I speed? What&rsquo;s the risk of getting into an accident?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the risk of getting pulled over or things like that? I think in you don&rsquo;t realize they&rsquo;re doing that. Yeah</p>
<p>I mean, they don&rsquo;t they don&rsquo;t know they&rsquo;re doing that</p>
<p>Like I think part of the answer is that I think politics kind of breaks</p>
<p>people&rsquo;s brain, right</p>
<p>because like before</p>
<p>The 2016 election we got a lot of criticism from like liberals for being</p>
<p>Too bullish on Trump. The market price is about 15 percent. We have it 30 percent, right?</p>
<p>so we are very bullish on Trump relative to other people but like</p>
<p>People thought we were like playing with the numbers to try to I don&rsquo;t know affect turnout somehow</p>
<p>or or try to cover our asses or things like that and so</p>
<p>so I just don&rsquo;t think that like</p>
<p>Politics teaches people to think critically and it&rsquo;s like yeah part of that is like they&rsquo;re not thinking probabilistically</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s more like people just want to see their kind of</p>
<p>priors</p>
<p>confirmed</p>
<p>What was it? Like when people blamed you for Trump one?</p>
<p>Yeah, there was a lot of that. Yeah. Yeah, I mean why did you pick Trump as president?</p>
<p>They literally I think they pointed to you and basically said you tipped the election</p>
<p>Like you you it&rsquo;s almost as if like you convince people to go and like how did you how did you deal with that?</p>
<p>You just kind of have to say like fuck you and move on with your life</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t like I&rsquo;ve been very lucky in my life overall, right including that like things that I think are not that remarkable</p>
<p>Like, you know saying oh the polls are gonna be right usually which they were in 2008 and 2012</p>
<p>Like I think we got way too much credit for that, but you can&rsquo;t like I mean again</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re all poker players here, right? So it&rsquo;s kind of like if you kind of get your money in</p>
<p>Really good right and you make a flush or something like it you kind of have to have that attitude about it</p>
<p>So you were able to just basically shut it out and say this and and what about just the fact that like you live inside</p>
<p>Of an organization now 538 is owned by ABC ABC</p>
<p>Was that before the election that was so we were we were</p>
<p>ESPN at the time of 2016 election now, we&rsquo;re ABC News currently and so does that change sort of like</p>
<p>Like how do you make sure that you can actually just do your job no matter how?</p>
<p>Unpopular the answer may be or the distribution of outcomes maybe</p>
<p>Okay. So why am I working on this book? It&rsquo;s partly because I want to diversify away from just</p>
<p>first of all, I think</p>
<p>Forecasting elections is an interesting problem, but it&rsquo;s not like the most interesting problem, right?</p>
<p>But no, I&rsquo;m not gonna spend the rest of my life just like being there like the election forecasting guy. It&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s I</p>
<p>mean you also face disincentives were like</p>
<p>The downside like we got some elections like really right like 2018 midterm we like</p>
<p>Nail like perfectly about as good as you could right and people are like, oh, that&rsquo;s nice, right?</p>
<p>if you get kind of went like the 2020 primary like we were very bullish on Joe Biden when people weren&rsquo;t and thought he was</p>
<p>gonna lose and so you don&rsquo;t get like a lot of</p>
<p>Credit and you do face like a lot of downside</p>
<p>For being actually wrong or perceived to be wrong</p>
<p>And so yeah, I&rsquo;m not gonna spend the rest of my life making</p>
<p>Election forecast. I hope that&rsquo;s part of the portfolio of things that I do</p>
<p>But like I&rsquo;m interested in like a lot of other questions about the world</p>
<p>Hey, what do you think about like social markets that are defined about social behavior like an election?</p>
<p>People are gonna vote one way or another you then make a prediction and then that changes the way people vote</p>
<p>And so like and the same is true in stock markets</p>
<p>I was gonna ask you about your experience in stock markets because people have an assumption about rate hikes</p>
<p>The the market then reacts to the assumption about rate rate hikes</p>
<p>Then the market tanks and then the Fed is like let&rsquo;s change the rate height system because the markets tanking</p>
<p>How do you think about building?</p>
<p>probabilistic models that account for social feedback loops where the social decision that&rsquo;s made is</p>
<p>Driven by the forecast you make or by the the market</p>
<p>So I think the evidence is that in two-way election</p>
<p>So a Democrat versus Republican that there&rsquo;s no clear effect from and by the way</p>
<p>Like what we do is is a tradition. There&rsquo;s always been horse race media coverage has always been polling going back for many years, right?</p>
<p>You know, we think our version of it is a little bit more grounded and objective</p>
<p>In two-way races. It&rsquo;s not clear if there&rsquo;s any impact either way where cash can in effect is when you&rsquo;re having a multiple candidate race, right?</p>
<p>in 2020 when Elizabeth Warren started to fall behind Bernie Sanders in the polls, right if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>Left-wing voter who prefers Warren to Sanders but Sanders to Biden, right?</p>
<p>You may kind of switch your vote as a result of the poll that can create momentum</p>
<p>Mathematically trying to not to model like a multi-way election. We do it. It&rsquo;s very hard</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s way more complex in part because of the feedback loops that it introduces for right and stock markets are the same</p>
<p>Again, I don&rsquo;t anymore any financial market behavior</p>
<p>It is funny by the way that like if I like lose a thousand bucks at poker</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be like furious right but like I lose like much more than that in the stock market and like you&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>Oh, I don&rsquo;t care. I just invest in you know</p>
<p>Low fee like mutual funds and stuff like that. I mean for sure. I mean, it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s um, I</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t know you guys would know more than I would but I think there are there are certainly complexities that involve</p>
<p>Feedback loops for sure Nate we live in a very polarized world right now</p>
<p>We all spend too far too much time on Twitter and we&rsquo;re seeing this, you know, sort of house of mirrors. I&rsquo;m curious how</p>
<p>You know the 19% of people who believe in</p>
<p>you know banning abortion and their impact and their outsized voice versus the far left and their outsized voice with</p>
<p>You know sort of democratic socialism</p>
<p>affect your ability to predict what&rsquo;s going to happen in the country because the majority of the country&rsquo;s beliefs sometimes are in stark contrast to</p>
<p>Political things that happen. Yeah, and even on our podcast people want to pit, you know</p>
<p>Saks and I as being incredible rivals. No, no, you you want to pit yourself?</p>
<p>But just to be clear, in fact, we agree on almost everything yet. It feels like in our society</p>
<p>You know</p>
<p>They want to push us to to pick very binary belief systems</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m just curious how that impacts what you do day to day in your job in predicting what&rsquo;s gonna actually happen in reality</p>
<p>And maybe you could tell us</p>
<p>based on what you&rsquo;ve learned over time are our people as polarized as it seems or is America actually got a</p>
<p>majority</p>
<p>Consensus on most of the issues that we struggle with</p>
<p>Well, okay</p>
<p>I one reason that markets work is because you get feedback in the market right and you adjust your strategy as a result of</p>
<p>Negative feedback from consumers people voting with their feet</p>
<p>I think one problem with Twitter and with kind of the political atmosphere more generally is that</p>
<p>Both the left and the right are now insulating themselves from from feedback in a lot of ways</p>
<p>and if you&rsquo;re someone who kind of like</p>
<p>Tries to call BS</p>
<p>I mean when you know</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a 12 characters like having a good bullshit detectors kind of an implicit theme of people who are successful</p>
<p>Gamblers, right and if you&rsquo;re like somebody like I that&rsquo;s kind of bullshit. I can&rsquo;t let that sit there</p>
<p>I have to say something about it</p>
<p>Even though it&rsquo;ll piss off my followers like you really get boundary policed a lot and when totally yeah boundary policed</p>
<p>Yes. Yeah, and when feedback mechanisms are broken, then you run into potentially some really</p>
<p>Dangerous outcomes, right? Like I think I think</p>
<p>Both the left and the right have become more authoritarian in certain ways</p>
<p>I think the type of authoritarianism on the right is quite a bit more dangerous in the moment, but</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re both kind of moving away from</p>
<p>Kind of liberalism in some kind of classical sense in some ways and and I think that has to do with</p>
<p>The feedback loops that social media tend to tend to produce that they&rsquo;re very about social media</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like it really really flattens things right one thing that people in Silicon Valley</p>
<p>Get right for all their faults and self-serving this in some ways, right?</p>
<p>They kind of get the orders of magnitudes, right? They understand scale</p>
<p>And social media and the daily news cycle really collapses that right</p>
<p>So some extremely important problem and some trivial nonsense are kind of treated on the same level when one is</p>
<p>1,000 times more important than the other and that and that produces right in a feed</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one right after the other. Yeah, and you know again</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if there are ways to redesign Twitter to make that better</p>
<p>But like the fact that you&rsquo;re kind of always on right I mean before Twitter the kind of cable news cycle</p>
<p>You have to have like some</p>
<p>Controversy to talk about and things are completely dropped the next day. There&rsquo;s another news event</p>
<p>I mean sometimes it should be maybe actually this thing was terrible</p>
<p>But something is like way more important and so we should continue to focus on that and so that&rsquo;s damaging</p>
<p>I think is there a way out of this it will this pass in your estimation. Is this you know an intractable problem?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a little bit</p>
<p>Bearish and</p>
<p>Concerned in the short term. Yeah</p>
<p>To be honest, can you say more? What does that mean? I?</p>
<p>Mean there are different types of risks that we face, right?</p>
<p>I mean, you know one problem in particular is that if we have a close</p>
<p>Election next time particularly one that&rsquo;s close where the where the Democrat appears to narrowly win, right?</p>
<p>I mean you&rsquo;re having more and more Republican elected officials secretaries of state</p>
<p>some of the candidates in Pennsylvania for governor, for example, who kind of believe the election was was stolen in 2020 and like</p>
<p>Which it wasn&rsquo;t to be clear and like that&rsquo;s a very dangerous</p>
<p>Argument to have it may not resolve itself in the end of democracy. But like that&rsquo;s like a you know a</p>
<p>Risk that&rsquo;s you know in the 10%</p>
<p>Range or maybe higher of a severe constitutional crisis in 2024 and maybe repeated that in 2028 and so forth</p>
<p>And so I mean that&rsquo;s the I think the most</p>
<p>Immediate threat but also kind of government capacity to deal with big problems, right?</p>
<p>You know, I don&rsquo;t necessarily take the standard line about Kobe where you say</p>
<p>Oh, we should have done this and that and managed it more top-down more but clearly like state capacity seemed to be</p>
<p>Not so great right as we deal with other existential risks from climate change to AI potentially to nuclear threats</p>
<p>You know a little bit bearish about state capacity to make good decisions in complex situations</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not perfect information. Yeah, you know, I&rsquo;ve heard like being down in</p>
<p>Miami, you know or traveling other parts of the world</p>
<p>Do you see like there&rsquo;s more reason to be optimistic right where?</p>
<p>Where people at least are excited and dynamic and there&rsquo;s something happening. It may not be exactly the right thing, but people are are</p>
<p>Are happy?</p>
<p>But no, I think I think I don&rsquo;t know. I&rsquo;m usually not just a person and I&rsquo;m a little bit worried about</p>
<p>What should we expect then going into the 2020 midterms?</p>
<p>2020 midterms. So the baseline is pretty strong, which is that the president&rsquo;s party loses seats the large majority of the time</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>Given the Democrats majority are so narrow. They&rsquo;re pretty big underdogs to keep both the house and the Senate</p>
<p>With that said in Senate races in particular individual candidates do matter to some extent and you might have enough</p>
<p>Off-the-wall GOP candidates nominated that would cost them</p>
<p>Two or three seats potentially and that might be enough to save Democrats in the Senate</p>
<p>The house for the candidates are more anonymous and there are more seats in play is a little bit tougher</p>
<p>I do think something like Roe v. Wade is important</p>
<p>Democrats talk a lot about Republican extremism, but a lot of it is theoretical, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s saying well what will happen in 2024 will be this or that</p>
<p>This is the kind of rare example of big social change by the opposition party</p>
<p>And that could I think motivate Democrats a little bit but but midterm elections are more predictable</p>
<p>than presidential elections and the base cases that you wind up with</p>
<p>With Republican majorities of some magnitude sacked any thoughts on</p>
<p>Nate&rsquo;s handicapping of the situation and</p>
<p>description of the political climate ring</p>
<p>Well, I mean pretty clearly the Republicans are expected to have big pickups in this midterm, right?</p>
<p>I mean, I agree with you. The Senate is tougher for the GOP because</p>
<p>There aren&rsquo;t that many the most of the at-risk seats are on the Republican side, right? Not the Democratic side</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean there are there also seats like Pennsylvania the GOP</p>
<p>Held and could lose potentially but you have like I mean, I don&rsquo;t know how technically you want to get</p>
<p>If you have a generic ballot that favors Republicans by like two points</p>
<p>The Democrats can probably keep the Senate if it gets to like six points or seven points then</p>
<p>Then the wall topples and like there&rsquo;s just too many forces going the other way. And so yeah</p>
<p>So what so where do you where is it right now? Are you looking at that right now? It&rsquo;s two or three</p>
<p>However, that&rsquo;s among registered voters and doesn&rsquo;t reflect voter enthusiasm</p>
<p>So typically the challenger party is more motivated to turn out you saw that in states like Virginia last year</p>
<p>That gap seems to be closing a little bit</p>
<p>I do think some of the</p>
<p>anti-abortion</p>
<p>Legislation right some of the fact that the GOP kind of is now</p>
<p>Back on offense on culture wars against LGBT people, right? I think</p>
<p>Potentially is is</p>
<p>Going to help motivate Democrats to turn out, right?</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t the stuff in Virginia where they were talking about. Oh schools and kind of I mean you always want to like play</p>
<p>counter-attack in politics, right</p>
<p>And Republicans found some effective counterattacks with respect to educational policy</p>
<p>Certain attitudes where kind of very left-wing ideas have crept into discussions of education and race and other things, right?</p>
<p>but now they&rsquo;re like kind of calling like</p>
<p>Gay and lesbian people and trans people pedophiles and stuff like that, right and it&rsquo;s like surprisingly mainstream discourse and like it&rsquo;s not I don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>Politically why it&rsquo;s also a little bit dangerous in terms of potentially, you know triggering violence and things like that</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know. I mean neither party can really like</p>
<p>Help itself, I don&rsquo;t think and kind of being like the worst version of itself</p>
<p>Right. Yeah, it&rsquo;s interesting</p>
<p>I bet young Ken is an interesting case because one year after Biden won that state by ten</p>
<p>Youngkin wins that race by two or three. So it was 12 points swing. Yeah in one year</p>
<p>How</p>
<p>Emblematic is that of how quickly the mood of the country has changed?</p>
<p>Is it like a one-off because young was a strong candidate against a weak candidate or does it represent?</p>
<p>You know a much stronger generic Republican ballot. I think it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s I mean, that&rsquo;s what you might get if you had</p>
<p>50 Glenn Youngkin&rsquo;s running for for Senate, right?</p>
<p>He clearly I mean, there&rsquo;s usually a pretty big midterm shift, but that was a little bigger than normal in Virginia</p>
<p>And that reflects the fact that I mean you can like model it out mathematically we have lots of data points</p>
<p>We have 35 Senate races every two years, right?</p>
<p>You can actually see the effect of being more moderate will gain you an extra two or three or four points, right?</p>
<p>being less</p>
<p>Moderate more radical in some cases will lose you two or three or four points</p>
<p>And so and so the fact that the GP didn&rsquo;t kind of take that lesson and say we can actually kind of occupy</p>
<p>the mainstream and</p>
<p>Have potentially really large majorities at least in 2022</p>
<p>I mean, I think that&rsquo;s kind of kind of disheartening in in some ways</p>
<p>And of course Trump is still a big figure in the Democrats learned the lesson of that race either</p>
<p>The lesson for Democrats would be to attack towards the center as well and instead of embracing sort of the the progressive left</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>Mean the Democrats are still talking about canceling student debt, which is a</p>
<p>fringe issue that affects 8 to 10 percent of the Democratic Party without realizing that it actually is because it represents 50 or 60 percent of</p>
<p>the working majority of the Democratic infrastructure and</p>
<p>People are people are people are self-serving and if you don&rsquo;t have good BS detectors, then</p>
<p>You become more self-serving right like clearly like the class of people who are</p>
<p>high student loan debt</p>
<p>are people who are well educated and</p>
<p>Aren&rsquo;t necessarily making as much money and those describe people that are tend to be Democrats, right?</p>
<p>It describes people like academics and people in media</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;d be very him but it all Democrats used to also be the the workers party for the welders the truckers the construction</p>
<p>Workers should say you should say let&rsquo;s forgive up to $10,000 in debt for</p>
<p>public</p>
<p>university students</p>
<p>Undergraduate educations right that really does capture a lot more people who are who are you know, truly middle-class, right?</p>
<p>Half of student loan debt is people going to graduate school</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;m not that simple if you went to Dartmouth and got a philosophy degree masters masters, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, you&rsquo;re on your own</p>
<p>Yeah, I got a degree in nursing and our kind of why should an electrician bail out the person getting a master&rsquo;s in philosophy</p>
<p>but like this is kind of a matter of like the</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s me. That&rsquo;s a reasonable thing to say. Yeah, it doesn&rsquo;t seem partisan doesn&rsquo;t seem unreasonable</p>
<p>Supervision, but but you know, but I know and again people are it&rsquo;s also different</p>
<p>I think if you needed more a financial stimulus then it might make more sense to</p>
<p>Find some way to do that. This is a thing that the president can probably do by executive authority. It&rsquo;s a little bit disputed</p>
<p>But no you kind of have I mean both parties are quite</p>
<p>Self-serving and if you&rsquo;re kind of not listening to critiques or feedback then you can kind of wallow in in in</p>
<p>That self-serving this I think a little bit more easily. All right, everybody, please. Thank Nate&rsquo;s over</p>
<p>Let your winners ride rain, man, David</p>
<p>We open-sourced it to the fans and they&rsquo;ve just gone crazy</p>
<p>Besties are</p>
<p>My dog</p>
<p>We should all just get a room and just have one big huge or because they&rsquo;re all just like this like sexual tension</p>
<p>But they just need to release</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going</p>
