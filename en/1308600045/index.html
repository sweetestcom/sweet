    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>where we discuss science</p>
<p>and science-based tools for everyday life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Andrew Huberman,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology</p>
<p>at Stanford School of Medicine.</p>
<p>Today, we are discussing the immune system,</p>
<p>and we are also discussing the nervous system,</p>
<p>which is the brain spinal cord</p>
<p>and the connections of the brain and spinal cord</p>
<p>with all the organs of the body.</p>
<p>We are also going to discuss</p>
<p>how the nervous system can be used to activate</p>
<p>and control the immune system.</p>
<p>Now, about 10, 20 years ago,</p>
<p>if somebody said that the mind</p>
<p>could control the immune system,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;d probably get laughed out of most academic conferences</p>
<p>and certainly the work wouldn&rsquo;t be published</p>
<p>in quality journals.</p>
<p>But nowadays, there are dozens, if not hundreds,</p>
<p>of quality peer-reviewed studies on how the mind</p>
<p>and how the nervous system</p>
<p>can control activation of the immune system.</p>
<p>This is a wonderful growing body of research.</p>
<p>And just to give you a hint</p>
<p>of where we are headed with this,</p>
<p>just this last week, there was a paper published in Nature,</p>
<p>which is the apex journal for scientific publishing,</p>
<p>premier journal, extremely stringent.</p>
<p>A paper published in Nature from Chufu Ma&rsquo;s lab</p>
<p>at Harvard Medical School</p>
<p>explored how acupuncture can reduce inflammation</p>
<p>in the body.</p>
<p>And I will describe this study in a bit more detail later,</p>
<p>but what they discovered was that by stimulating the body</p>
<p>in particular ways at particular sites on the body,</p>
<p>they were able to liberate certain cells and molecules</p>
<p>that enhance the function of the immune system</p>
<p>and potentially can be used</p>
<p>to combat different types of infection.</p>
<p>And just to give you another little hint,</p>
<p>they found that a particular type of organ tissue</p>
<p>called fascia, some of you may have heard of fascia.</p>
<p>Fascia surrounds our muscles.</p>
<p>Just to look at it,</p>
<p>you might think it&rsquo;s a kind of useless tissue.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sort of like a dense bag</p>
<p>in which the muscles are contained.</p>
<p>Well, it turns out that those dense bags</p>
<p>are much smarter than we thought.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t have a mind of their own,</p>
<p>but by stimulating the fascia</p>
<p>in a particular location on the body,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a pathway leading out of that fascia</p>
<p>directly to an organ called the adrenal medulla.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll explain what all this means.</p>
<p>That could liberate particular chemicals</p>
<p>that had a potent anti-inflammatory effect.</p>
<p>So what we&rsquo;re basically saying</p>
<p>is that the nervous system acts as a set of highways</p>
<p>between the different tissues of your body,</p>
<p>calling into action the immune system,</p>
<p>liberating particular molecules</p>
<p>that can reduce inflammation and lead to faster healing.</p>
<p>And I will explain how all of that works</p>
<p>as well as some other non-acupuncture methods</p>
<p>for activating and enhancing the function</p>
<p>of the immune system.</p>
<p>So today we&rsquo;re going to be talking</p>
<p>all about healing with the mind</p>
<p>in a completely non-mystical, non-abstract sense.</p>
<p>Before we begin, I&rsquo;d like to emphasize</p>
<p>that this podcast is separate</p>
<p>from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.</p>
<p>It is, however, part of my desire and effort</p>
<p>to bring zero cost to consumer information</p>
<p>about science and science-related tools</p>
<p>to the general public.</p>
<p>In keeping with that theme,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank the sponsors of today&rsquo;s podcast.</p>
<p>Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens.</p>
<p>Athletic Greens is an all-in-one</p>
<p>vitamin mineral probiotic drink.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been taking Athletic Greens since 2012,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m delighted that they&rsquo;re sponsoring the podcast.</p>
<p>The reason I started taking Athletic Greens</p>
<p>and the reason I still take Athletic Greens</p>
<p>once or twice a day is that it helps me cover</p>
<p>all of my basic nutritional needs.</p>
<p>It makes up for any deficiencies that I might have.</p>
<p>In addition, it has probiotics,</p>
<p>which are vital for microbiome health.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done a couple of episodes now</p>
<p>on the so-called gut microbiome</p>
<p>and the ways in which the microbiome interacts</p>
<p>with your immune system, with your brain to regulate mood,</p>
<p>and essentially with every biological system</p>
<p>relevant to health throughout your brain and body.</p>
<p>With Athletic Greens, I get the vitamins I need,</p>
<p>the minerals I need, and the probiotics</p>
<p>to support my microbiome.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Athletic Greens,</p>
<p>you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>and claim a special offer.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll give you five free travel packs,</p>
<p>plus a year supply of vitamin D3K2.</p>
<p>There are a ton of data now showing that vitamin D3</p>
<p>is essential for various aspects of our brain</p>
<p>and body health.</p>
<p>Even if we&rsquo;re getting a lot of sunshine,</p>
<p>many of us are still deficient in vitamin D3.</p>
<p>And K2 is also important because it regulates things</p>
<p>like cardiovascular function, calcium in the body,</p>
<p>and so on.</p>
<p>Again, go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>to claim the special offer of the five free travel packs</p>
<p>and the year supply of vitamin D3K2.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Element.</p>
<p>Element is an electrolyte drink</p>
<p>that has everything you need and nothing you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>That means the exact ratios of electrolytes are in Element,</p>
<p>and those are sodium, magnesium, and potassium,</p>
<p>but it has no sugar.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked many times before on this podcast</p>
<p>about the key role of hydration and electrolytes</p>
<p>for nerve cell function, neuron function,</p>
<p>as well as the function of all the cells</p>
<p>and all the tissues and organ systems of the body.</p>
<p>If we have sodium, magnesium, and potassium</p>
<p>present in the proper ratios,</p>
<p>all of those cells function properly,</p>
<p>and all our bodily systems can be optimized.</p>
<p>If the electrolytes are not present and if hydration is low,</p>
<p>we simply can&rsquo;t think as well as we would otherwise,</p>
<p>our mood is off, hormone systems go off,</p>
<p>our ability to get into physical action,</p>
<p>to engage in endurance and strength,</p>
<p>and all sorts of other things is diminished.</p>
<p>So with Element, you can make sure</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re staying on top of your hydration</p>
<p>and that you&rsquo;re getting the proper ratios of electrolytes.</p>

<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Thesis.</p>
<p>Thesis makes what are called nootropics,</p>
<p>which means smart drugs.</p>
<p>Now, to be honest, I am not a fan of the term nootropics.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe in smart drugs in the sense that</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe that there&rsquo;s any one substance</p>
<p>or collection of substances that can make us smarter.</p>
<p>I do believe based on science, however,</p>
<p>that there are particular neural circuits</p>
<p>and brain functions that allow us to be more focused,</p>
<p>more alert, access creativity, be more motivated, et cetera.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just the way that the brain works.</p>
<p>Different neural circuits for different brain states.</p>
<p>Thesis understands this.</p>
<p>And as far as I know,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re the first nootropics company</p>
<p>to create targeted nootropics for specific outcomes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Thesis for more than six months now,</p>
<p>and I can confidently say that their nootropics</p>
<p>have been a total game changer.</p>
<p>My go-to formula is the clarity formula,</p>
<p>or sometimes I&rsquo;ll use their energy formula before training.</p>
<p>To get your own personalized nootropic starter kit,</p>
<p>go online to takethesis.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>take a three-minute quiz,</p>
<p>and Thesis will send you four different formulas</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m pleased to announce that the Huberman Lab podcast</p>
<p>is now partnered with Momentus Supplements.</p>
<p>We partnered with Momentus for several important reasons.</p>
<p>First of all, they ship internationally</p>
<p>because we know that many of you are located</p>
<p>outside of the United States.</p>
<p>Second of all, and perhaps most important,</p>
<p>the quality of their supplements is second to none,</p>
<p>both in terms of purity and precision</p>
<p>of the amounts of the ingredients.</p>
<p>Third, we&rsquo;ve really emphasized supplements</p>
<p>that are single ingredient supplements</p>
<p>and that are supplied in dosages</p>
<p>that allow you to build a supplementation protocol</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for cost,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for effectiveness,</p>
<p>and that you can add things and remove things</p>
<p>from your protocol in a way</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really systematic and scientific.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to see the supplements</p>
<p>that we partner with Momentus on,</p>
<p>you can go to livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>There you&rsquo;ll see those supplements,</p>
<p>and just keep in mind that we are constantly expanding</p>
<p>the library of supplements available</p>
<p>through Momentus on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>Okay, let&rsquo;s talk about the immune system</p>
<p>and the nervous system and how the two interact</p>
<p>and how you can control your immune system</p>
<p>to serve you better.</p>
<p>We are going to talk a lot of mechanistic science,</p>
<p>a little bit of detail.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll learn some new language around the immune system,</p>
<p>names of the different cell types and so forth,</p>
<p>but I promise to make it all very clear</p>
<p>regardless of your background.</p>
<p>We are also going to discuss a lot of tools.</p>
<p>And I think many of you are probably here</p>
<p>because you want to know what you can do</p>
<p>in order to boost or enhance the function</p>
<p>of your immune system.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a very reasonable question to ask.</p>
<p>I want to begin by just acknowledging</p>
<p>that if one were to put that question into the internet,</p>
<p>you would get back a lot of answers.</p>
<p>And there is now a sort of generic form of that answer</p>
<p>that deserves our respect,</p>
<p>but is not going to be the topic of conversation today.</p>
<p>I just want to tip my hat to it, however,</p>
<p>and list off a few of the things that we know</p>
<p>set us up to be healthier than we would be</p>
<p>if we didn&rsquo;t do these things.</p>
<p>So the first of course,</p>
<p>is the foundation of all mental and physical health,</p>
<p>which is to get adequate sleep, meaning enough sleep,</p>
<p>whatever it is for you that you require to get deep sleep.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s got to be of high quality</p>
<p>and to time that sleep correctly,</p>
<p>meaning you can&rsquo;t sleep during the day one day</p>
<p>and at night the next day</p>
<p>and expect your system to function well.</p>
<p>Talked a lot about that before on this podcast.</p>
<p>You need a relatively consistent sleep schedule</p>
<p>most of the time, about 80% of the time,</p>
<p>or even better would be 90% of the time.</p>
<p>But the realities of life make it</p>
<p>that we can&rsquo;t always go to bed at the same time</p>
<p>and wake up at the exact same time, okay?</p>
<p>So we need sleep.</p>
<p>We do need sunshine.</p>
<p>Why do we need sunshine?</p>
<p>Because it sets our rhythm into a regular state</p>
<p>where the genes in all of our cells</p>
<p>can be expressed at the correct times</p>
<p>where sort of a factory of cells, if you will,</p>
<p>and that factory can only run properly</p>
<p>if it knows when certain things should be active</p>
<p>and when certain cells should not be active.</p>
<p>And the best way to coordinate all of those activities</p>
<p>of all the cells is to get sunshine in your eyes</p>
<p>in the morning and again in the evening</p>
<p>and not to get too much bright light in your eyes</p>
<p>in the middle of the night.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just foundational.</p>
<p>And then any lists that you&rsquo;ll find</p>
<p>on any number of websites on the internet would say,</p>
<p>okay, get good sleep, get sun, get exercise.</p>
<p>How much exercise?</p>
<p>We should all be getting 150 to 180 minutes</p>
<p>of zone two cardio.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s cardiovascular exercise</p>
<p>where we can just barely hold a conversation</p>
<p>or maybe not per week.</p>
<p>We should be eating well.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re always told we have to get good nutrition.</p>
<p>What good nutrition means to you</p>
<p>is going to be different than what it means</p>
<p>to somebody else.</p>
<p>But we acknowledge that food intake</p>
<p>and quality of food in particular,</p>
<p>avoiding processed foods, that&rsquo;s going to be important.</p>
<p>Social connection is important.</p>
<p>Hydration is important.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re starting to get the picture.</p>
<p>We can take all that, acknowledge it as useful</p>
<p>and foundational for mental and physical health.</p>
<p>But of course, there are many people who still struggle</p>
<p>with getting ill too often</p>
<p>or with not being able to heal</p>
<p>from physical injuries and wounds</p>
<p>or from various bacterial and viral infections</p>
<p>quickly enough or deal with chronic disease.</p>
<p>And so today&rsquo;s really about how you can take all</p>
<p>of that information, acknowledge it and follow it.</p>
<p>But in addition to that,</p>
<p>there are things that you can do</p>
<p>to leverage your nervous system</p>
<p>in order to enhance the function of your immune system</p>
<p>in very robust ways.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s where I&rsquo;d like to shift the conversation to.</p>
<p>The first topic we have to attack is the question</p>
<p>of what is the immune system and how does it work?</p>
<p>I think many of you have heard of antibodies</p>
<p>or killer cells or the various organs of the body</p>
<p>that are involved in the immune system,</p>
<p>like the bone marrow, the spleen,</p>
<p>the thymus and the lymph nodes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to just take a moment</p>
<p>and do a sort of brief immune system 101.</p>
<p>Really simple, cover the basic elements of the immune system</p>
<p>so that everyone listening or watching this</p>
<p>can get a clear sense of how the immune system functions</p>
<p>and what its basic parts are.</p>
<p>For some of you, this might be too basic.</p>
<p>It might be a little bit of background that you already know.</p>
<p>I think for most of you, this information will be new.</p>
<p>And I promise you, you don&rsquo;t need a biology</p>
<p>or medicine background in order to understand this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually really simple</p>
<p>because it is truly elegant in design.</p>
<p>You have three main layers of defense for your health.</p>
<p>These are the three things that are constantly at work</p>
<p>to protect you from invasion and illness,</p>
<p>from bacteria, from viruses and from parasites.</p>
<p>And the first of those three is a physical barrier</p>
<p>that we call your skin.</p>
<p>And that might seem kind of obvious,</p>
<p>but everything about you is contained in this compartment</p>
<p>that is boundaried by your skin.</p>
<p>And your skin is a very important aspect</p>
<p>of your immune system.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve ever had a cut,</p>
<p>you essentially have a breach of the boundary</p>
<p>that is your immune system.</p>
<p>And you would notice a number of things would happen.</p>
<p>You might get some swelling around that cut.</p>
<p>You might get a scab.</p>
<p>Likely you would get a scab over time.</p>
<p>If it got dirty, there were some bacteria that got in there.</p>
<p>You might see some accumulation of white blood cells,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s called pus.</p>
<p>I know it&rsquo;s kind of gross, but that&rsquo;s what that is.</p>
<p>It might take on a yellow tint</p>
<p>because of the accumulation of some dead cells there.</p>
<p>But basically your skin is the primary barrier</p>
<p>through which you keep things from the outside</p>
<p>that could harm you from getting to the inside.</p>
<p>Now, still in category one,</p>
<p>your body and your external surface,</p>
<p>you have openings to that surface, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not just a round or a body shaped,</p>
<p>completely covered up with skin.</p>
<p>You have openings.</p>
<p>What are those openings?</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s start at the top and work our way down.</p>
<p>A primary site of potential infection are your eyes.</p>
<p>You have your ears, you have your nostrils,</p>
<p>you have your mouth, okay?</p>
<p>Those are going to be the primary sites</p>
<p>by which things can get into your system.</p>
<p>And you need to put things into your system.</p>
<p>You need to drink and eat,</p>
<p>and you need to get light into your system.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why you have those openings.</p>
<p>But bad things, meaning things that can harm you,</p>
<p>can get into those systems.</p>
<p>And then of course, along the back of your throat,</p>
<p>all the way down to your stomach and your digestive system,</p>
<p>and through your intestines and out your rectum,</p>
<p>you have a tube that you are basically a series of tubes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve said that before in this podcast,</p>
<p>and this is one such tube by which you extract nutrients</p>
<p>from the outside environment.</p>
<p>But all along that tube, including your nose and your mouth,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s lined with mucus.</p>
<p>And while mucus might seem kind of gross to some of you,</p>
<p>the more you learn about mucus,</p>
<p>the more you realize that mucus is really, really cool.</p>
<p>Because mucus essentially acts as a filter,</p>
<p>as a trap for bacteria and viruses.</p>
<p>And it has certain ways of scrubbing</p>
<p>or killing those bacteria and viruses.</p>
<p>Now, the mucus is constantly being turned over.</p>
<p>And as we&rsquo;ll talk about later,</p>
<p>the chemistry of that mucus is really important</p>
<p>in order to make sure that certain things</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t make it into your system,</p>
<p>and other things are allowed to move through your system,</p>
<p>and you can extract nutrients from them.</p>
<p>So the reason I&rsquo;m talking about this first category</p>
<p>of barrier for immune system in such detail</p>
<p>is I&rsquo;d like you to envision yourself as a human, of course,</p>
<p>but as a human that is a clear entity from everything else,</p>
<p>and you have to bring in the right things,</p>
<p>and you have to keep out the wrong things or kill them.</p>
<p>Now, inevitably, bacteria, viruses,</p>
<p>and parasitic infections are going to make their way</p>
<p>into our body.</p>
<p>But whether or not they are killed off</p>
<p>or whether or not they take over and cause us harm</p>
<p>is going to be determined by layers two and three.</p>
<p>So layers two and three are the so-called innate</p>
<p>immune system and the adaptive immune system.</p>
<p>So the innate immune system</p>
<p>is what I would call the second layer of defense.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very fast.</p>
<p>So whether or not it&rsquo;s bacteria, virus, or parasite,</p>
<p>what happens when you have something enter your body,</p>
<p>maybe you swallowed it, maybe it got in through your eyes,</p>
<p>maybe you shook somebody&rsquo;s hand</p>
<p>who was carrying a particular kind of illness,</p>
<p>and then you wiped your eyes.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve talked about on this podcast before,</p>
<p>very soon after we meet another person,</p>
<p>usually within 30 seconds, believe it or not,</p>
<p>most people wipe that person&rsquo;s chemicals</p>
<p>somewhere on their face or on their body surface.</p>
<p>This has been demonstrated over and over again.</p>
<p>If you want to learn more about that,</p>
<p>we did an episode all about chemical signaling</p>
<p>where you can learn about it.</p>
<p>I know it sounds weird, and you might say,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t do that, but indeed you do most of the time.</p>
<p>Most everybody does.</p>
<p>Okay, so this innate immune system is this rapid response</p>
<p>when something enters our system</p>
<p>and our body doesn&rsquo;t recognize it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not food, it&rsquo;s not clean air.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s either a bacteria, virus, or parasite.</p>
<p>And the innate immune system involves the release</p>
<p>of particular cells that are waiting, dormant,</p>
<p>ready to attack whatever this invader is.</p>
<p>And some of these cell types you&rsquo;ve heard of before,</p>
<p>the most typical one are the so-called white blood cells.</p>
<p>So the white blood cells will actively go to the site</p>
<p>of invasion and will start to encapsulate</p>
<p>or try and surround that given invader.</p>
<p>The other names of these different cell types</p>
<p>are things like neutrophils, macrophages,</p>
<p>natural killer cells,</p>
<p>just a few of the many types of immune cells.</p>
<p>So this is kind of like an ambulance system,</p>
<p>but rather than go and try and heal something</p>
<p>like a paramedic would, they go there</p>
<p>and they try and surround and kill whatever this invader is.</p>
<p>They work in concert with two other assistants.</p>
<p>And those assistants are called the complement proteins.</p>
<p>Complement proteins exist in the blood.</p>
<p>And what they do is they travel to sites</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s an invasion and they mark certain things</p>
<p>for being engulfed and eaten.</p>
<p>So they sort of put an eat me tag on it.</p>
<p>They basically put a chemical tag onto invaders</p>
<p>that then allows those white blood cells, neutrophils,</p>
<p>macrophages, and natural killer cells to say,</p>
<p>ah, I need to basically wrap,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll kill this thing and then wrap it in a body bag</p>
<p>and send it off, kill that thing,</p>
<p>wrap it in a body bag and send it off.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m using the analogy of the body bag,</p>
<p>but in a sense it is one, it&rsquo;s the right one rather,</p>
<p>because these cells that come in and kill things,</p>
<p>the way they do that is actually to engulf</p>
<p>the invading bacteria, virus, or parasite.</p>
<p>So they actually surround it.</p>
<p>And when you see pus or you see infection</p>
<p>in maybe a cut on the skin or something like that,</p>
<p>or even in a ingrown hair that gets some bacteria in it,</p>
<p>that pus and that the white part,</p>
<p>I know it&rsquo;s kind of gross to talk about,</p>
<p>but those are the white blood cells.</p>
<p>And those are the dead, oftentimes it&rsquo;s dead cells.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the dead invader sitting there.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s trying to create an isolated compartment</p>
<p>because it wants to keep it in that part of the body.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve got the innate immune system.</p>
<p>The compliment comes through blood</p>
<p>and helps it by tagging certain things</p>
<p>with an eat me signal.</p>
<p>And then there are the cells that are either damaged</p>
<p>from the injury or from the parasite,</p>
<p>or are suffering because of the bacteria</p>
<p>or the virus itself.</p>
<p>And the cells of your body will also release</p>
<p>an alarm signal, which is not an eat me signal,</p>
<p>but a help me signal.</p>
<p>And those help me signals come in the form</p>
<p>what we call cytokines.</p>
<p>And the cytokines are things like interleukin one,</p>
<p>interleukin six, tumor necrosis factor alpha.</p>
<p>You may have heard of these things.</p>
<p>If you are at all curious about,</p>
<p>or been learning about the health space,</p>
<p>online health space, especially in the last few years,</p>
<p>inflammation is all the buzzword now.</p>
<p>Everyone&rsquo;s talking about inflammation,</p>
<p>inflammation, inflammation.</p>
<p>What do we mean when we say inflammation?</p>
<p>Well, inflammation is a physical response,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also a chemical response.</p>
<p>And many times the markers of inflammation</p>
<p>that are measured in people or in animal models,</p>
<p>excuse me, where this research is done</p>
<p>are things like interleukin one, interleukin six,</p>
<p>tumor necrosis factor alpha.</p>
<p>So when those go up in the blood,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a sign that somewhere there&rsquo;s a cell</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s saying, help me, help me,</p>
<p>and is secreting these things,</p>
<p>which calls in those neutrophils, macrophages,</p>
<p>natural killer cells and white blood cells, okay?</p>
<p>And it might help to remember all this,</p>
<p>but by just telling people that what interleukin means</p>
<p>is to communicate, right?</p>
<p>So the interleukin is shouting out, help me.</p>
<p>The complement proteins are coming in and saying, eat,</p>
<p>eat this and tagging the invader with an eat me signal.</p>
<p>And then the killer cells and the white blood cells</p>
<p>are doing the job of trying to kill off that thing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the innate immune system.</p>
<p>So that your skin and your mucus lining</p>
<p>plus your innate immune system</p>
<p>are a beautiful two layered set of defenses</p>
<p>against various kinds of invaders and infections.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s the third type,</p>
<p>which is the adaptive immune system.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ll notice that leading up until now,</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t said the word antibody at all.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because it is the job,</p>
<p>not of the skin or the mucus or the microbiome</p>
<p>or the innate immune system to produce antibodies</p>
<p>that can recognize specific invaders,</p>
<p>but rather it is the job of the adaptive immune system</p>
<p>to create antibodies against bacteria, viruses,</p>
<p>and even parasites and even physical intruders</p>
<p>to your system.</p>
<p>So the adaptive immune system has this incredible ability</p>
<p>to show up at the site of invasion</p>
<p>or infection or inflammation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called there by various cues,</p>
<p>including the cytokines that we talked about earlier.</p>
<p>And what it does is it actually attaches to</p>
<p>and creates a sort of an imprint of the shape</p>
<p>of whatever invader happens to be there.</p>
<p>So if that particular invading bacteria or virus</p>
<p>has a contour that&rsquo;s kind of rippled or kind of spiky</p>
<p>or whatever shape it happens to have,</p>
<p>it creates an imprint of that.</p>
<p>And then using that imprint in concert</p>
<p>with some other cells creates antibodies</p>
<p>that are specific to recognize that invader</p>
<p>should the body ever have that invader inside of it again.</p>
<p>Now, that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s called the adaptive immune system.</p>
<p>And in many ways, it creates a memory of a prior infection</p>
<p>so that these antibodies can be made</p>
<p>anytime that same invader comes back again, all right?</p>
<p>And so this is the basis of what we call immunity.</p>
<p>This is the basis of what we call an enhanced ability</p>
<p>to combat certain types of infections.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s really a wonderful, and I mean,</p>
<p>just I can&rsquo;t even state how incredible this really is</p>
<p>that all of our bodies have this capacity, right?</p>
<p>We have something called leukocytes.</p>
<p>These are essentially white blood cells.</p>
<p>We have red blood cells and white blood cells,</p>
<p>and they both are derived from the same type of origin cell.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a stem cell.</p>
<p>When you hear stem cell, a stem cell just means a cell</p>
<p>that can become many different types of other cells.</p>
<p>We sometimes hear about stem cells in terms of people</p>
<p>that are getting injections of stem cells</p>
<p>or the potential therapeutic effects</p>
<p>of or potential of stem cells,</p>
<p>but we all harbor certain stem cells within us as well</p>
<p>that can become lots of different cell types.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s one particular type of stem cell,</p>
<p>which is the hemopoietic stem cell,</p>
<p>which can give rise to red blood cells</p>
<p>and white blood cells.</p>
<p>And in general, these reside in the marrow,</p>
<p>at least in adults.</p>
<p>So in our bone marrow,</p>
<p>we have this ability to make certain cells</p>
<p>that can go out when they are called out chemically,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re called out to sites of infection</p>
<p>and create antibodies,</p>
<p>and then maintain those antibodies in our system</p>
<p>or have a memory of that particular infection</p>
<p>so that if the infection comes back again,</p>
<p>we can kill it off immediately.</p>
<p>And it doesn&rsquo;t have to pass through these multiple stages</p>
<p>of first the innate response,</p>
<p>then the adaptive response, taking some time.</p>
<p>Now, there are a lot more details</p>
<p>to the adaptive immune system,</p>
<p>but I just want to emphasize a few points</p>
<p>that might be relevant.</p>
<p>First of all, the name of the antibodies that are created</p>
<p>sometimes come in the form of IgM and IgG,</p>
<p>things of that sort.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t a full deep dive immunology class,</p>
<p>but Ig stands for immunoglobulin, okay?</p>
<p>So the immunoglobulins are part</p>
<p>of the adaptive immune response</p>
<p>in creating antibodies.</p>
<p>If you hear IgM, the IgM is the first</p>
<p>of the adaptive immune responses,</p>
<p>and it tends to come on earlier.</p>
<p>So if somebody is immunopositive for IgM</p>
<p>for a particular type of viral or bacterial invader,</p>
<p>that means that it was a fairly recent infection.</p>
<p>Later, one creates the adaptive immune system,</p>
<p>I should say, creates an IgG,</p>
<p>which is the more stable form of the specific antibody</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to recognize a given invader.</p>
<p>So IgG tends to come up a little bit later.</p>
<p>So just to recap, something gets into your system</p>
<p>through your eyes, through some hole in your skin,</p>
<p>a cut through your mouth.</p>
<p>Sexually transmitted diseases come in</p>
<p>through the mucus membranes that are on the genitalia</p>
<p>or in the genitalia.</p>
<p>Sexually transmitted disease, airborne disease,</p>
<p>gets into the mucus, somehow gets into the bloodstream.</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s the innate response,</p>
<p>which is a more general response of trying to contain</p>
<p>and combat the infection or invader.</p>
<p>And then the adaptive response is the one</p>
<p>that generates the antibodies.</p>
<p>First, the IgM response, the immunoglobulin M response,</p>
<p>and then the immunoglobulin G response, IgG response.</p>
<p>So how do we keep these three barriers</p>
<p>or these three defense systems to infection tuned up?</p>
<p>Well, leaving aside the list of things</p>
<p>that I mentioned before,</p>
<p>that generally enhances their function,</p>
<p>things like sleep and sunlight and good nutrition, et cetera,</p>
<p>the sort of generic things for good health.</p>
<p>One of the key ways we can do that</p>
<p>is to keep that mucus lining in really good shape.</p>
<p>And what does that mean?</p>
<p>Well, the mucus lining needs to turn over quite often,</p>
<p>and it needs to be the correct chemistry</p>
<p>to be a trap for the bad stuff.</p>
<p>And for it to be permeable to the good stuff,</p>
<p>to the nutrients that we need.</p>
<p>And it is now very clear from hundreds,</p>
<p>if not thousands of studies,</p>
<p>that the best way to do that</p>
<p>is to maintain a healthy so-called microbiome.</p>
<p>The microbiome being these little bacterial organisms</p>
<p>that are good for us,</p>
<p>that live all along our mucus pathways,</p>
<p>and even in our eyes.</p>
<p>Now, just to be really clear,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not just about the gut microbiome.</p>
<p>We actually have a microbiome in our eyes.</p>
<p>We have one that&rsquo;s specific to our mouth.</p>
<p>We have a nasal specific microbiome.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s one all along the gut,</p>
<p>and the species of microbiota</p>
<p>that live all along the digestive tract</p>
<p>differ from the mouth to the throat,</p>
<p>to the stomach, intestines, and to the rectum.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s well-established that there are healthy microbiota</p>
<p>that live all along that length,</p>
<p>and they differ along that length.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also a urethral microbiota,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a vaginal microbiota</p>
<p>that promotes health of that environment as well.</p>
<p>So how is it that one can maintain the healthy microbiota</p>
<p>and not favor growth of harmful bacteria</p>
<p>or allow that mucus lining to become too permeable</p>
<p>to the bad stuff that can come in from the environment?</p>
<p>Well, as far as we know,</p>
<p>there are three main ways to do that.</p>
<p>The first two are purely structural and mechanical.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very clear now from work,</p>
<p>some of which was done at Stanford, but elsewhere as well,</p>
<p>that the nasal microbiome is particularly good</p>
<p>at scrubbing bacteria,</p>
<p>at preventing certain types of infections.</p>
<p>So this is a reminder that whenever possible,</p>
<p>unless eating or speaking,</p>
<p>you want to be nasal breathing,</p>
<p>not breathing through your mouth.</p>
<p>Your nose is a much better filter</p>
<p>for viruses and bacteria than is your mouth.</p>
<p>The mouth contains certain structural features,</p>
<p>even organs and cell types</p>
<p>that can protect against incoming infection,</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t want to be a mouth breather</p>
<p>for a variety of reasons.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a terrific book called Jaws, A Hidden Epidemic,</p>
<p>which was written by my colleagues,</p>
<p>Sandra Kahn and Paul Ehrlich at Stanford</p>
<p>and Stanford Medicine with a forward by Jared Diamond</p>
<p>and Robert Sapolsky.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s really a lot of heavy hitters on that book</p>
<p>that talks about the increase in infection</p>
<p>that one gets when breathing through the mouth</p>
<p>as opposed to the nose.</p>
<p>Now, of course, during hard exercise,</p>
<p>one reads through the mouth, that&rsquo;s not necessarily bad.</p>
<p>When one is eating or speaking,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not necessarily bad at all.</p>
<p>I guess it depends on what you&rsquo;re saying.</p>
<p>It was a joke.</p>
<p>But in general, when possible,</p>
<p>you want to be breathing through your nose.</p>
<p>Many people have trouble breathing through their nose</p>
<p>because of so-called deviated septums</p>
<p>or chronically collapsed sinuses.</p>
<p>The best way to dilate those sinuses</p>
<p>is actually to breathe through your nose.</p>
<p>So it can take a little bit of time,</p>
<p>but there is some plasticity to the sinuses.</p>
<p>And so be a nose breather, not a mouth breather.</p>
<p>You will combat more of the infections</p>
<p>that you are constantly confronted with.</p>
<p>I should mention that we are always bombarded</p>
<p>with different types of bacteria, viruses</p>
<p>and parasites in our environment.</p>
<p>And the goal, of course, is to reinforce your immune system</p>
<p>so you can keep these things at bay and not get sick.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s actually a paper that was published in Cell Report,</p>
<p>Cell Press Journal, excellent journal that showed</p>
<p>that the nasal microbiome has particular species</p>
<p>of microbiota that are good at fighting off infection.</p>
<p>There has not been a direct link</p>
<p>between particular patterns of nasal breathing</p>
<p>and the nasal microbiome yet,</p>
<p>but oxygenation of that environment</p>
<p>by breathing through your nose</p>
<p>turns out to be quite important overall</p>
<p>for enhancing it as a filter.</p>
<p>So don&rsquo;t just think of your nose</p>
<p>as something to smell foods and to bring in air.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also an active filter for things that could invade you.</p>
<p>The other way to try and keep out bad things</p>
<p>and to avoid getting sick is the advice that your mother</p>
<p>and certainly my mother gave me,</p>
<p>which is to not touch your eyes</p>
<p>after touching other people or touching other surfaces.</p>
<p>And as I mentioned earlier,</p>
<p>we tend to do this subconsciously and that,</p>
<p>but the reason to avoid doing that is the eyes</p>
<p>are a primary entry point for a lot of bacteria and viruses.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re constantly lubricating the surface of your eyes</p>
<p>with the so-called lacrimal glands and tears</p>
<p>and things of that sort.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve ever noticed when you wake up in the morning,</p>
<p>you have some sleep in your eyes,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re the kind of crusty stuff in the corners of your eyes</p>
<p>or on your eyelashes, that sleep, that crust</p>
<p>are actually dead bacteria</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve successfully battled during the night.</p>
<p>Okay, that&rsquo;s what that is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the accumulation of some healthy tissue,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the accumulation of your healthy mucus membranes</p>
<p>and tears and other things</p>
<p>that are specifically combating those bacteria.</p>
<p>So I know that sounds a little bit gross,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s what that is.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re wiping away the casualties of a battle</p>
<p>that you fought at night.</p>
<p>So during the daytime, you don&rsquo;t want to introduce viruses</p>
<p>and things to your eyes as much as possible.</p>
<p>It is a primary site of entry.</p>
<p>This is why people wear goggles in surgical units</p>
<p>and things of that sort</p>
<p>to try and avoid getting things into their eyes.</p>
<p>Very, very important.</p>
<p>And then the third way to keep a healthy line of defense</p>
<p>for your entire mucus tract</p>
<p>is to enhance the proliferation of good gut microbiota.</p>
<p>The best way to enhance the quality of your gut microbiome</p>
<p>and the mucus lining that serves as this protective layer</p>
<p>all along your body is to ingest two to four servings a day</p>
<p>of fermented foods, low sugar fermented foods.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked about this before a bunch of times</p>
<p>on the podcast, but these are data from my colleague,</p>
<p>Justin Sonnenberg&rsquo;s lab at Stanford Med.</p>
<p>And there, I just wiped my eyes.</p>
<p>Yep, you got me.</p>
<p>But a paper published in the journal Cell,</p>
<p>which is a absolutely spectacular journal,</p>
<p>really points to the fact that when people eat</p>
<p>fermented foods, two to four servings per day,</p>
<p>it helps reduce the activity of certain cytokines.</p>
<p>Now you know what those are, right?</p>
<p>Cells make cytokines to call out, help me, help me,</p>
<p>to reduce the amount of cytokines,</p>
<p>the so-called inflammatome.</p>
<p>Now that doesn&rsquo;t render those cells more vulnerable.</p>
<p>The reason they saw a reduction in IL-6 and IL-1</p>
<p>and some of these other cytokines</p>
<p>is because when people have a healthy gut microbiome,</p>
<p>there are fewer cells in the body being infected</p>
<p>from outside infections</p>
<p>and therefore less of a reason for cells to be crying out,</p>
<p>help, because they are thriving, not suffering.</p>
<p>So don&rsquo;t wipe your eyes, keep your hands clean.</p>
<p>Everyone tells you that, right?</p>
<p>But keep your hands clean.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t wipe your eyes.</p>
<p>Be a nasal breather, not a mouth breather,</p>
<p>unless you&rsquo;re speaking, exercising, or eating.</p>
<p>And keep a healthy gut microbiome</p>
<p>by eating two to four servings a day</p>
<p>of quality low-sugar fermented foods.</p>
<p>Things like sauerkraut, things like natto,</p>
<p>if you can access that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve tried it before, it&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sort of an acquired taste.</p>
<p>Kimchi, pickles, again, low-sugar sources</p>
<p>are going to be the sources</p>
<p>that are going to be most effective for this.</p>
<p>So now you&rsquo;re armed with three ways</p>
<p>to enhance the function of your immune system</p>
<p>and combat infection that is, I like to think,</p>
<p>separate from the typical type of information that you get,</p>
<p>such as, you know, get good sleep, good nutrition,</p>
<p>good social connection, et cetera.</p>
<p>All that stuff still holds true,</p>
<p>but these three other points, I think,</p>
<p>can really make a substantial difference</p>
<p>in terms of bolstering the immune system,</p>
<p>your immune system.</p>
<p>I do want to mention,</p>
<p>because these names are going to come up several times</p>
<p>during this episode,</p>
<p>that while interleukins like IL-6 and IL-1</p>
<p>encourage inflammation,</p>
<p>they are these help me signals</p>
<p>that call in cells to gobble up invaders,</p>
<p>there are some interleukins that are anti-inflammatory.</p>
<p>And the one that I&rsquo;d like to highlight in particular,</p>
<p>because it will come up again in a little bit,</p>
<p>is interleukin-10.</p>
<p>So not all of the IL, insert number,</p>
<p>not all of the interleukins are inflammatory,</p>
<p>some are anti-inflammatory.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s an important point to keep in mind</p>
<p>as we go forward.</p>
<p>Next, I&rsquo;d like to talk about what&rsquo;s called sickness behavior</p>
<p>and indeed, there is a category of behavior</p>
<p>that we call sickness behavior</p>
<p>that is very informative</p>
<p>as to the things that we can do to avoid getting sick.</p>
<p>Now, this notion of sickness behavior</p>
<p>goes back several decades or more.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a very interesting way of looking</p>
<p>at the function of the immune system</p>
<p>because what it does is it bridges us from this thing</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re calling the immune system</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s T cells and B cells and cytokines and leukocytes.</p>
<p>And it starts taking us into the realm of the nervous system</p>
<p>because of course the nervous system controls behavior.</p>
<p>So sickness behavior is a suite of responses</p>
<p>that we tend to all undergo when we are feeling sick.</p>
<p>So this is going to vary from person to person,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s some general categories of things</p>
<p>that we all do and that happened to all of us</p>
<p>after we are wounded or sick</p>
<p>or dealing with an infection of any kind.</p>
<p>And by examining sickness behavior in some detail,</p>
<p>it can be really informative</p>
<p>as to routes that we can take to health.</p>
<p>So the main thing about sickness behavior</p>
<p>is that it tends to involve a slowing</p>
<p>of our usual levels of activity.</p>
<p>People start to feel lethargic</p>
<p>or they feel like the activities</p>
<p>that previously they could do with relative ease</p>
<p>are very difficult for them or somewhat overwhelming.</p>
<p>The other thing you start to see</p>
<p>is that people and animals, by the way, stop grooming.</p>
<p>They stop taking care of themselves,</p>
<p>not necessarily stop showering,</p>
<p>although oftentimes that&rsquo;s the case,</p>
<p>but they will stop doing their hair.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll stop putting on makeup.</p>
<p>You know, depending on whether or not they did that before,</p>
<p>they might stop.</p>
<p>Animals will stop licking and grooming themselves.</p>
<p>People will stop taking care of their cosmetic appearance.</p>
<p>Now, it&rsquo;s not just because they don&rsquo;t care</p>
<p>how they look when they&rsquo;re sick,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s because there&rsquo;s this overall suppression</p>
<p>of certain kinds of activities</p>
<p>and an enhancement of other kinds of activities.</p>
<p>And this is really important.</p>
<p>Sickness behavior is actually a motivated state.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a state that&rsquo;s designed to accomplish certain things.</p>
<p>One of the other features of sickness behavior,</p>
<p>in addition to being lethargic, loss of grooming,</p>
<p>will be a loss of appetite, right?</p>
<p>Oftentimes people who have a great appetite</p>
<p>normally just won&rsquo;t feel hungry at all.</p>
<p>And there are several theories as to why this would be.</p>
<p>One prominent idea in the literature</p>
<p>is that it&rsquo;s to discourage vomiting and diarrhea,</p>
<p>which of course can be infectious to other people.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a theory.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know that that&rsquo;s ever been tested directly,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s one idea.</p>
<p>The other idea is that it&rsquo;s simply</p>
<p>to harbor more resources for sake of repair.</p>
<p>And I want to talk about that</p>
<p>because we are all told to get extra sleep</p>
<p>when we aren&rsquo;t feeling well or to rest.</p>
<p>But just like any good two or three-year-old</p>
<p>constantly asks, why, why?</p>
<p>Good scientists, good people who are interested</p>
<p>in health information should always be asking, why?</p>
<p>Why should I get more sleep?</p>
<p>What happens in sleep that I should get more sleep</p>
<p>when I&rsquo;m sick?</p>
<p>Why shouldn&rsquo;t I just push through this?</p>
<p>And there are a couple of reasons for this</p>
<p>that have been established in the literature.</p>
<p>The first is that there does seem to be something useful</p>
<p>about slowing circulation when we are ill.</p>
<p>One idea that has some data to support it</p>
<p>is that when we slow our circulation,</p>
<p>our blood circulation, you know,</p>
<p>so not running around so much or running at all,</p>
<p>but rather lying down, getting extra rest,</p>
<p>maybe sleeping, maybe even just remaining still</p>
<p>is that the lymphatic system,</p>
<p>which carries a lot of the immune-related cells and fluids</p>
<p>is able to ramp up its levels of activity.</p>
<p>So this is interesting, right?</p>
<p>So reducing circulation of the blood,</p>
<p>but increasing circulation of the lymphatic system.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve all probably been familiar with the lymphatic system.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re combating an infection,</p>
<p>your lymph nodes can get sore.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got lymph nodes behind your ears and your groin,</p>
<p>your armpits, around your throat,</p>
<p>around your, near your thyroid, in your throat, et cetera.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the other reason.</p>
<p>Now, some people, when they get sick,</p>
<p>psychologically go into a very vulnerable state</p>
<p>where they really, really want people,</p>
<p>other people to take care of them.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve probably witnessed this</p>
<p>or you feel this way yourself.</p>
<p>About 50% of people have that response.</p>
<p>They really want to be taken care of.</p>
<p>Now, when you think about it from an adaptive perspective,</p>
<p>this makes sense, right?</p>
<p>A member of our species is ill</p>
<p>and they more or less will cry out for help</p>
<p>in one form or another to the other members of their species</p>
<p>to take care of them.</p>
<p>And of course, this will be especially apparent</p>
<p>in cases where people are young enough</p>
<p>or incapacitated enough</p>
<p>that they can&rsquo;t actually get resources on their own.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve ever been really sick,</p>
<p>just getting up and going to the fridge</p>
<p>or to the restroom can feel like a monumental task.</p>
<p>So about 50% of people report</p>
<p>or describe seeking of help and support when they are sick.</p>
<p>But you could also imagine</p>
<p>how this would be a very non-adaptive response</p>
<p>because it increases the opportunity</p>
<p>to spread infection to the caretaker.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s an interesting consideration.</p>
<p>Another 50% of people seem to have the opposite response</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re sick.</p>
<p>So somehow, regardless of how they were prior to getting ill,</p>
<p>the sickness behavior that&rsquo;s engaged</p>
<p>by these neural circuits in the brain,</p>
<p>they are indeed neural circuits in the brain,</p>
<p>create a stay away from me.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to be bothered.</p>
<p>I want to be left alone.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to be taken care of, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not stubbornness.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s literally a lack of interest or a disinterest</p>
<p>in social connection when one is sick.</p>
<p>And you see this in animals too.</p>
<p>Some animals will seek out other members of their species.</p>
<p>Others like my, unfortunately now passed away,</p>
<p>bulldog Costello, when he was sick,</p>
<p>I always knew because he would go around</p>
<p>the back of the house and he would just hide there.</p>
<p>He would just take himself away from everybody else.</p>
<p>He did not want to be taken care of.</p>
<p>And it was just a natural response to him.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think he was trying to prevent me</p>
<p>from getting whatever it was that he had.</p>
<p>So if ever somebody doesn&rsquo;t want to be taken care of,</p>
<p>or if they do want to be taken care of,</p>
<p>realize that people tend to fall into these two bins</p>
<p>naturally and animals tend to fall into these bins</p>
<p>regardless of what species they are.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about 50-50.</p>
<p>And again, this sickness behavior is a motivated state.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s designed to slow circulation of the blood,</p>
<p>increase circulation of the lymph</p>
<p>and the other killer cells in the body,</p>
<p>reduce the probability of infecting others</p>
<p>by reducing its thought diarrhea and vomit,</p>
<p>but also breathing on others, interacting with others.</p>
<p>And in some cases it will activate this,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to call it a regressed state,</p>
<p>but many people feel somewhat more,</p>
<p>if they are adults,</p>
<p>they feel more childlike when they are ill</p>
<p>and they want to be taken care of very badly.</p>
<p>Some of it might be learned,</p>
<p>some of it might be innate, we don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>But the sickness behavior is very interesting</p>
<p>for a couple of reasons.</p>
<p>First of all, it mimics another state</p>
<p>that has been described in the neuroscience literature,</p>
<p>which is major depression.</p>
<p>And in both sick individuals,</p>
<p>sick from bacterial viral infection,</p>
<p>and in people with major depression,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s been shown that there are robust increases</p>
<p>in the levels of interleukin-6</p>
<p>and tumor necrosis factor alpha.</p>
<p>So there is an idea now circulating</p>
<p>that depression involves these inflammatory cytokines</p>
<p>being very active.</p>
<p>And we know that illness involves inflammatory cytokines</p>
<p>being very active.</p>
<p>So if you think about it,</p>
<p>the similarity between major depression and being sick</p>
<p>ought to be able to point us in a direction of interventions</p>
<p>that could help us either prevent illness</p>
<p>or move through illness more quickly.</p>
<p>But as we head in that direction,</p>
<p>because indeed that&rsquo;s the case,</p>
<p>I just want to emphasize that sickness behavior</p>
<p>is what provides this bridge between the immune system</p>
<p>and the nervous system.</p>
<p>And what we&rsquo;ll soon see also is that healthy behavior,</p>
<p>behavior that allows us to avoid infection</p>
<p>also points to a clear bridge between the nervous system</p>
<p>and the immune system.</p>
<p>That it isn&rsquo;t just that we have a brain and body</p>
<p>and our organs, and then we have an immune system.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true, but they&rsquo;re interacting all the time.</p>
<p>And this is going to lead us to a place</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s going to be very clear</p>
<p>and not at all surprising how certain patterns of thinking</p>
<p>and certain behaviors that we can elect to take</p>
<p>can help enhance our immune system function and vice versa.</p>
<p>There are two other features of sickness behavior</p>
<p>that are definitely worth pointing out.</p>
<p>One is a theory, which is that the reduced appetite,</p>
<p>in particular appetite for protein-rich foods when sick</p>
<p>is thought to be an attempt,</p>
<p>a subconscious attempt of the organism</p>
<p>to reduce the amount of iron that it&rsquo;s taking in.</p>
<p>Now, typically the amount of iron intake</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s recommended or more or less is for men,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s about eight milligrams per day.</p>
<p>For women, it&rsquo;s anywhere from 18 to 27 milligrams per day,</p>
<p>depending on whether or not they&rsquo;re pregnant,</p>
<p>lactating or menstruating, et cetera.</p>
<p>The ranges can vary.</p>
<p>But, and indeed it&rsquo;s true that if iron levels in the blood</p>
<p>go too high, like over 45 milligrams per day</p>
<p>can be very toxic to the system.</p>
<p>But the theory that&rsquo;s prominent in the biology literature</p>
<p>and in the health literature is that the reduction</p>
<p>in appetite is actually an attempt to reduce iron intake</p>
<p>specifically because many bacteria</p>
<p>and other forms of infection seem to thrive</p>
<p>when levels of iron in the blood are high.</p>
<p>Now, I don&rsquo;t want to see anyone take this to extreme</p>
<p>and suddenly do an iron deprivation diet</p>
<p>in order to get well.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s an interesting theory that I&rsquo;d be remiss</p>
<p>if I didn&rsquo;t mention, because it makes good sense.</p>
<p>Iron is actually attached to hemoglobin</p>
<p>and red blood cells in the bloodstream.</p>
<p>Normally that can help us quite a lot.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also in muscle, I should mention that.</p>
<p>Iron can be sequestered into muscle.</p>
<p>And iron serves a lot of important health promoting roles,</p>
<p>but by reducing appetite and thereby reducing iron intake,</p>
<p>it does reduce the capacity of certain things,</p>
<p>including infections to travel in certain compartments</p>
<p>within the body.</p>
<p>So again, that&rsquo;s just theory,</p>
<p>but I think many of you are probably familiar</p>
<p>with not having an appetite when you&rsquo;re sick.</p>
<p>The other thing that&rsquo;s very typical</p>
<p>of people with major depression is loss of appetite.</p>
<p>Not always, but often loss of appetite.</p>
<p>So here again, we have loss of appetite</p>
<p>in sickness behavior, loss of appetite in major depression.</p>
<p>And perhaps not surprisingly,</p>
<p>one of the major symptoms of sickness behavior</p>
<p>and major depression that map more or less</p>
<p>onto one another is loss of libido or interest,</p>
<p>not just in social interactions,</p>
<p>but in sex and reproduction.</p>
<p>And so again, if you think about sickness behavior</p>
<p>and depression, they are very, very similar.</p>
<p>Okay, so sickness behavior and major depression</p>
<p>have certain core features in common.</p>
<p>We need to therefore ask ourselves,</p>
<p>why and how does being sick influence the way</p>
<p>that we think and perceive our environment</p>
<p>and impact our appetite,</p>
<p>whether or not we want to be cared for more</p>
<p>or cared for less.</p>
<p>Again, people tend to diverge into two different bins there.</p>
<p>And believe it or not,</p>
<p>the pathway for this has been identified.</p>
<p>When we have an infection someplace in our body,</p>
<p>and it could be up in our head,</p>
<p>you know, it could be a sinus infection,</p>
<p>it could be an ear infection,</p>
<p>or I should also mention many of these same mechanisms</p>
<p>can also be the consequence of a wound</p>
<p>or an injury to the body.</p>
<p>You know, a back injury or a slip disc,</p>
<p>or I guess it&rsquo;s called a herniated disc</p>
<p>is the way that you hear it described.</p>
<p>When we have that, we can be kind of irritable.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t want to do certain things</p>
<p>and we just want to be left alone.</p>
<p>Things are harder.</p>
<p>How?</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s a known pathway,</p>
<p>which is the so-called vagus nerve</p>
<p>that connects the body and the brain,</p>
<p>signals to particular brain sites</p>
<p>to engage this category of motivational state</p>
<p>that we call sickness behavior.</p>
<p>Many of you have probably heard of the vagus,</p>
<p>V-A-G-U-S, vagus.</p>
<p>The vagus nerve is a very extensive nerve pathway.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the 10th cranial nerve,</p>
<p>comes out of the back of the brainstem,</p>
<p>heads into the body and branches out extensively</p>
<p>to innervate or connect to many of our organs,</p>
<p>including our lungs, our heart, our gut, et cetera.</p>
<p>And all of those organs are able also</p>
<p>to send neural signals back up to the brain.</p>
<p>We sometimes hear the vagus</p>
<p>as the route to calming ourselves down.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, that&rsquo;s more or less a myth</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t know how it got propagated.</p>
<p>You have lots of different pathways in the vagus.</p>
<p>Usually vagal stimulation actually creates more arousal</p>
<p>and alertness, although it does have multiple pathways.</p>
<p>But there have now been many studies of the vagus</p>
<p>in various contexts, including in sickness behavior.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s very clear that the vagus nerve</p>
<p>is the fast pathway by which an infection</p>
<p>in the body is signaled to the brain</p>
<p>to a particular location in the brain</p>
<p>called the hypothalamus,</p>
<p>which harbors a lot of different types of neurons.</p>
<p>Neurons, for instance, in the preoptic area</p>
<p>that increase body temperature and fever, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one of the most important things</p>
<p>is to increase body temperature</p>
<p>in order to, it&rsquo;s the body&rsquo;s attempt</p>
<p>to kill off this invader.</p>
<p>Because many viruses and many bacteria</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t survive well at elevated heat.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the function of a fever.</p>
<p>A fever actually has a functional role.</p>
<p>So in biology, we like complicated words.</p>
<p>So we call anything that increases body temperature</p>
<p>or creates a fever, a pyrogen.</p>
<p>Many years ago in my undergraduate years,</p>
<p>I was working on pyrogens,</p>
<p>injecting something called lippy polysaccharide</p>
<p>into the belly, which then gives you a fever.</p>
<p>The way it does that is LPS causes an inflammation response</p>
<p>in the gut.</p>
<p>The gut doesn&rsquo;t know what is happening.</p>
<p>The stomach cells don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>So they just start secreting the IL-6, the IL-1,</p>
<p>all those cytokines, the killer cells migrate into the gut.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why you sometimes get a stomach ache</p>
<p>when you don&rsquo;t feel well,</p>
<p>you have a flu or something like it.</p>
<p>A neural signal, electrical signals,</p>
<p>get sent up to the hypothalamus.</p>
<p>The hypothalamus says,</p>
<p>oh, I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s going on out there,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a signal something&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just heat up the body.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just start cooking whatever it is out there.</p>
<p>Of course, you don&rsquo;t want fever to go too high</p>
<p>because you can kill brain cells,</p>
<p>but within a particular range,</p>
<p>the fever is a functional and adaptive response.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re taking drugs to try and lower the fever,</p>
<p>that might make you feel more comfortable,</p>
<p>but actually that&rsquo;s limiting the response</p>
<p>that your body is creating in order to try and kill</p>
<p>off that invader.</p>
<p>And again, you don&rsquo;t want fever to go too high.</p>
<p>This is going to vary depending on age.</p>
<p>You can look up online what the range,</p>
<p>tolerable ranges are for fever,</p>
<p>but when you&rsquo;re trying to lower body temperature,</p>
<p>when you have a fever,</p>
<p>unless you&rsquo;re heading into dangerous levels of heating up,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s actually the wrong way to take your system</p>
<p>if you do indeed want to kill off that invader.</p>
<p>Okay, so the vagus nerve is the quick response.</p>
<p>It also sends input to areas of the brain</p>
<p>that change your perception of the outside world.</p>
<p>One of the most obvious of these,</p>
<p>once I tell it to you, is photophobia, right?</p>
<p>I love bright sunshine.</p>
<p>I love bright lights when I want to be alert.</p>
<p>We all have different levels of light sensitivity,</p>
<p>but most people, when they are sick,</p>
<p>when there&rsquo;s an inflammation response in the body,</p>
<p>they feel like bright lights are kind of aversive.</p>
<p>They get a well-described kind of classical photophobia,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s mediated by a pathway that goes from your eye</p>
<p>to an area of your thalamus</p>
<p>called the anterior nucleus of the thalamus.</p>
<p>This is work that was done by Clifford Saper</p>
<p>at Harvard Medical School.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really beautiful work.</p>
<p>And then from there up to the outer lining of the brain,</p>
<p>which is the meninges,</p>
<p>just sort of on the outside of the brain,</p>
<p>where the brain starts to interface</p>
<p>with some of the other connective tissues.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll talk more about these later.</p>
<p>It can actually create a photophobia and a headache</p>
<p>when one is ill.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s the pathway.</p>
<p>Some invader gets into your system</p>
<p>because you wiped your eyes or got in through your mouth.</p>
<p>You didn&rsquo;t listen to your mother</p>
<p>and got in through your eyes.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re feeling sick.</p>
<p>Something&rsquo;s going on there.</p>
<p>You have a stomach ache</p>
<p>because of all the inflammation there.</p>
<p>The signal goes up from your vagus nerve.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re heating up with a fever.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got photophobia</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;ve activated this pathway</p>
<p>by which what would normally be tolerable light</p>
<p>is triggering this thalamic nucleus, the anterior thalamus.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s projecting up to the meninges.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got a headache in response to looking at light.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s basically triggering an overall pathway</p>
<p>to get you to go into a quiet, dark place and rest.</p>
<p>And the last element I&rsquo;d like to talk about is the rest.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something that gets triggered</p>
<p>from the body to the brain, to the hypothalamus,</p>
<p>and we think we know which hypothalamic area it is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the supraoptic nucleus, we think.</p>
<p>Supraoptic because it&rsquo;s right above</p>
<p>your so-called optic chiasm.</p>
<p>If you want to look up where that is,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s right above the roof of your mouth.</p>
<p>And there are nuclei there</p>
<p>that promote the desire to sleep even during the daytime,</p>
<p>what would normally be the active phase</p>
<p>of your circadian cycle.</p>
<p>Now, that is really interesting</p>
<p>because what&rsquo;s happening here</p>
<p>is you&rsquo;ve got multiple pathways that are saying,</p>
<p>avoid light, reduce your amount of behavior,</p>
<p>heat up all the things that are making you sick.</p>
<p>This is sickness behavior,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s going from your body to your mind</p>
<p>to make you do the right thing.</p>
<p>Now, there&rsquo;s also a slow pathway</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s purely mediated by the blood,</p>
<p>so-called humoral factors, not because they&rsquo;re funny,</p>
<p>but humoral factors are factors of the blood.</p>
<p>As you have an infection for many hours or days,</p>
<p>the amount of IL-6 and IL-1 and tumor necrosis factor</p>
<p>and other inflammatory cytokines</p>
<p>is starting to increase such that</p>
<p>the total amount in your circulation gets high enough</p>
<p>and is communicated to the brain.</p>
<p>And it tends to enter the brain</p>
<p>through a particular type of tissue</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really interesting called choroid, C-H-O-R-O-I-D.</p>
<p>Choroid is really interesting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of this fluffy tissue</p>
<p>that sits in your ventricles.</p>
<p>The ventricles are the spaces in your brain,</p>
<p>and the spaces in your brain</p>
<p>have what&rsquo;s called cerebral spinal fluid in them.</p>
<p>That cerebral spinal fluid</p>
<p>contains a number of important things,</p>
<p>but the choroid starts releasing and responding</p>
<p>to these cytokines, the inflammatory cytokines.</p>
<p>And then the brain actually starts to experience</p>
<p>all sorts of changes in terms of inflammation to neurons.</p>
<p>Your memory tends to get poor.</p>
<p>Your cognition tends to get poor.</p>
<p>These are transient things.</p>
<p>Most often, eventually these things will pass,</p>
<p>but this is deep into sickness</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re really feeling lousy.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t read, you can&rsquo;t watch a movie,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t do anything.</p>
<p>So if you ever get sick</p>
<p>and you just can&rsquo;t be bothered by anything,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s probably because you&rsquo;ve had that fast response</p>
<p>from the body and you&rsquo;ve also had this slower response</p>
<p>where you literally have a set of tissues in your brain</p>
<p>that are sending out these inflammatory signals.</p>
<p>And now your whole brain is starting to cope</p>
<p>or is trying to cope with this infection.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve got a slow pathway and a fast pathway.</p>
<p>That all sounds really terrible.</p>
<p>So now I&rsquo;d like to talk about what you can do</p>
<p>to reduce the probability of getting sick.</p>
<p>And there are actually things that one can do</p>
<p>as you start to get sick.</p>
<p>And once you&rsquo;re sick to accelerate the healing process</p>
<p>by flipping the equation.</p>
<p>Up until now, we&rsquo;ve been talking about how the body</p>
<p>activates certain areas in the brain</p>
<p>to create sickness behavior</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s very much like depression.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re probably all familiar with this</p>
<p>from any time you&rsquo;ve had a cold or a flu</p>
<p>or something really lousy or an injury.</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s flip the equation and ask,</p>
<p>what can we do with our nervous system</p>
<p>in order to enhance the function of our immune system</p>
<p>in order to be able to heal and recover</p>
<p>from illness and injury more quickly?</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s say you are in that unfortunate circumstance</p>
<p>of waking up one day or coming home</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve got that tickle in your throat</p>
<p>or when you breathe your nasal passages</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t feel the same way.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got a little bit of a headache.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re feeling kind of off.</p>
<p>We all know what we should do.</p>
<p>We should all hydrate, drink some water and go to sleep.</p>
<p>Right, that&rsquo;s what we are all told.</p>
<p>But there are actually things that you can actively do</p>
<p>in order to get your immune system</p>
<p>to deploy a more robust response</p>
<p>at that early phase of potential infection.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s focus first on the rest component.</p>
<p>Yes, of course, we are all told</p>
<p>that we should take a hot shower and go to sleep,</p>
<p>and get nine or 10 hours of sleep.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s an interesting way of looking at sleep</p>
<p>specifically for its role in enhancing the immune system.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a wonderful review.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll put the review in the captions</p>
<p>that looked specifically at the literature</p>
<p>surrounding sleep that is different</p>
<p>because it occurs in support of the immune system.</p>
<p>So normally when we go to sleep,</p>
<p>we have slow wave sleep predominantly</p>
<p>in the early phase of the night.</p>
<p>And then over time, as we sleep longer and longer,</p>
<p>we get more so-called REM, rapid eye movement sleep.</p>
<p>Talked all about this on the episodes on sleep.</p>
<p>Of course, you have slow wave sleep and REM sleep</p>
<p>throughout the night always,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s the fraction of slow wave sleep to REM sleep</p>
<p>that shifts and they have different functions, et cetera.</p>
<p>There is some evidence that the sleep associated</p>
<p>with an infection, in particular early stage of infection,</p>
<p>is associated with elevated levels of serotonin</p>
<p>in the brain that either through an adaptive mechanism</p>
<p>or for whatever reason, the neurons in the brain</p>
<p>of the so-called Raphae nucleus</p>
<p>start releasing more serotonin.</p>
<p>And that that serotonin and its related pathways</p>
<p>can help enhance some of the immune system function</p>
<p>that could combat the infection.</p>
<p>There is starting to be some data,</p>
<p>and I emphasize starting</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s not a very robust literature yet,</p>
<p>looking at whether or not supplementing precursors</p>
<p>to serotonin like 5-HTP,</p>
<p>which can be taken in supplement form,</p>
<p>or consuming foods that increase serotonin naturally.</p>
<p>So these would be any foods</p>
<p>that contain high levels of tryptophan.</p>
<p>You can look up what those are.</p>
<p>So white meat turkey, for instance,</p>
<p>certain complex carbohydrates</p>
<p>can often be rich with tryptophan</p>
<p>that consuming those foods</p>
<p>can enhance the amount of serotonin</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s available in the brain and blood,</p>
<p>and thereby lead to the particular quality of sleep</p>
<p>that allows for more deep healing,</p>
<p>or for when I say deep healing,</p>
<p>I mean for a more robust immune response.</p>
<p>Now, again, those are still emerging data.</p>
<p>What is very clear, however,</p>
<p>is that during sleep and in particular during sleep</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s associated with the early stage</p>
<p>of any kind of viral or bacterial infection,</p>
<p>the so-called glymphatic system</p>
<p>is much more active than it would be normally.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the glymphatic system?</p>
<p>The glymphatic system</p>
<p>is actually a relatively recent discovery.</p>
<p>I mentioned lymph and the lymphatic system earlier.</p>
<p>The glymphatic system with a G</p>
<p>is a system in the brain by which debris</p>
<p>that accumulates throughout the day,</p>
<p>but in particular,</p>
<p>debris that accumulates under conditions</p>
<p>of neuroinflammation and inflammation of the body</p>
<p>is cleared out or is washed out of the brain.</p>
<p>And the activity of this glymphatic system</p>
<p>is extremely important</p>
<p>for the recovery from infection of any kind.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s now becoming clear</p>
<p>is important for recovery from traumatic head injury</p>
<p>and maybe even from psychological trauma.</p>
<p>So the glymphatic system</p>
<p>can be thought of more or less as a plumbing system</p>
<p>that runs through the ventricles,</p>
<p>but also mainly through the lining</p>
<p>that sits between the brain and the skull</p>
<p>and some of the other tissues and things of that sort.</p>
<p>The choroid is involved as well.</p>
<p>Brain imaging reveals the glymphatic system</p>
<p>is very active during deep sleep</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s this kind of washout of the glymphatic system.</p>
<p>And I am aware of some studies that are ongoing now</p>
<p>where augmenting the serotonin system</p>
<p>through either supplementation of tryptophan or 5-HTP</p>
<p>or even serotonin itself,</p>
<p>these are laboratory studies,</p>
<p>is being looked at for its capacity</p>
<p>to increase the amount of circulation</p>
<p>in the glymphatic system.</p>
<p>And the idea is that it might,</p>
<p>and I want to underscore might,</p>
<p>potentially lead to more rapid recovery</p>
<p>from injury and illness</p>
<p>and potentially ramp up, if you will,</p>
<p>the activity of the immune system.</p>
<p>So it essentially is a ramping up</p>
<p>of the activity of the immune system.</p>
<p>Now, regardless of whether or not you decide to,</p>
<p>for instance, supplement with 5-HTP before sleep or not,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll talk about what that might look like in a moment,</p>
<p>there is a way that you can increase</p>
<p>the activity of your glymphatic system</p>
<p>under normal circumstances.</p>
<p>Because of the mechanics of the glymphatic system,</p>
<p>it turns out that if you elevate your heels</p>
<p>by about 12 degrees,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t have to be exactly 12,</p>
<p>as you sleep by putting maybe a rolled pillow</p>
<p>or two pillows underneath your feet,</p>
<p>by having the head below your legs,</p>
<p>it seems that there&rsquo;s more glymphatic washout</p>
<p>or clearance during sleep.</p>
<p>And this is without taking any compound</p>
<p>to adjust the serotonin system.</p>
<p>So I would say, if you&rsquo;re not feeling well,</p>
<p>yes, take the hot shower,</p>
<p>yes, get into bed and go to sleep,</p>
<p>but elevate your feet to try and increase</p>
<p>the activity of the glymphatic system.</p>
<p>Some might even consider that if you have to be awake,</p>
<p>that you might want to be awake</p>
<p>with your feet elevated above your head.</p>
<p>Now, that might not be practical for the workplace,</p>
<p>but it might be practical for a short nap during the day</p>
<p>or something of that sort.</p>
<p>The glymphatic system is not just active during sleep,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s also active during certain phases of waking</p>
<p>in particular, when we are in a deep state of relaxation.</p>
<p>So as many of you probably know,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a big proponent of self-hypnosis</p>
<p>because of the quality scientific literature on this.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re interested in self-hypnosis,</p>
<p>you can go to Reveri, R-E-V-E-R-I.com.</p>
<p>Reveri is a cost-free app for Apple and Android</p>
<p>that was developed by my colleague, David Spiegel</p>
<p>and others at the Stanford University School of Medicine</p>
<p>based on quality studies and peer-reviewed data,</p>
<p>showing that deep states of relaxation</p>
<p>can be used to improve pain management,</p>
<p>improve transition time to sleep,</p>
<p>and a number of other things.</p>
<p>You can select the various sort of outcomes</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re seeking using Reveri.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a great thing that,</p>
<p>especially for people that are challenged</p>
<p>with meditation could use</p>
<p>because you just listen to the script,</p>
<p>involves deep relaxation.</p>
<p>I would suggest using that script,</p>
<p>but with, or the script for sleep,</p>
<p>but with feet elevated to increase activity</p>
<p>of the glymphatic system.</p>
<p>Now, if you do decide that you want to test out</p>
<p>this serotonin hypothesis on your own,</p>
<p>obviously check with a doctor.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a doctor, I&rsquo;m a professor.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m professing things, not suggesting things.</p>
<p>But 5-HTP is a supplement that I&rsquo;ve talked about</p>
<p>before on this podcast that I actually do not recommend</p>
<p>for most people for sake of sleep</p>
<p>because it can disrupt the normal architecture of sleep</p>
<p>and create a deep sleep early in the night</p>
<p>and then a spontaneous waking with some trouble</p>
<p>to get back to sleep.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because of the way that the serotonin system</p>
<p>and the melatonin system interact.</p>
<p>However, under conditions where one is feeling</p>
<p>like they might have an infection</p>
<p>or an early stage of illness,</p>
<p>in that case, 5-HTP might be a useful supplement</p>
<p>in order to access these states of sleep</p>
<p>that are not typical.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not the typical deep sleep that you would achieve</p>
<p>on when you&rsquo;re feeling healthy.</p>
<p>These are states of sleep that are specifically there</p>
<p>in order to try and repair some of the immune system</p>
<p>related inflammation that&rsquo;s occurring.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to explore the 5-HTP approach</p>
<p>and you feel it&rsquo;s right and safe for you</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve talked to your doctor,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s 300 to 500 milligrams taken about 30 to 60 minutes</p>
<p>before going to sleep for the night.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the typical protocol.</p>
<p>Not incidentally, increasing serotonin</p>
<p>is also one typical approach</p>
<p>for the treatment of major depression.</p>
<p>This is the basis for things like SSRIs,</p>
<p>Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors,</p>
<p>like Prozac and Zoloft and so forth.</p>
<p>The 5-HTP approach is a much milder approach</p>
<p>than prescription drug, of course,</p>
<p>but will allow more serotonin</p>
<p>to be synthesized and or released.</p>
<p>Now, for those of you that are interested</p>
<p>in learning more about the glymphatic system,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a fascinating system</p>
<p>and you might want to do a deep dive there</p>
<p>in terms of the behavioral protocols</p>
<p>and what&rsquo;s known about it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a wonderful article called</p>
<p>The Glymphatic System, A Beginner&rsquo;s Guide.</p>
<p>This is a scientific article.</p>
<p>The first author is Jessen, is the last name, J-E-S-S-E-N.</p>
<p>If you put in Jessen, The Glymphatic System,</p>
<p>A Beginner&rsquo;s Guide,</p>
<p>you can access the full-length manuscript easily online.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll show up immediately in your search.</p>
<p>And in a really interesting way,</p>
<p>the glymphatic system has now also been tied</p>
<p>to the iron deposition system.</p>
<p>Earlier, we were talking about iron</p>
<p>and how, of course, getting enough dietary iron is important</p>
<p>but if levels of iron are too high,</p>
<p>it isn&rsquo;t good for a number of reasons.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a very interesting article</p>
<p>that just came out last year</p>
<p>called Dysfunction of the Glymphatic System</p>
<p>Might Be Related to Iron Deposition</p>
<p>in the Normal Aging Brain.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re starting to see these links</p>
<p>between iron levels being too high,</p>
<p>the glymphatic system not being active enough,</p>
<p>and so forth, leading to sickness behavior, inflammation,</p>
<p>and maybe even damage to neurons associated with aging.</p>
<p>We can flip that on its head and say</p>
<p>that increasing the activity of the glymphatic system,</p>
<p>feet elevated during deep sleep,</p>
<p>maybe even feet elevated above the head while awake,</p>
<p>during a nap or doing a reverie script once a day</p>
<p>or something of that sort,</p>
<p>could increase the activity of the glymphatic system.</p>
<p>Lowering iron to a point that&rsquo;s probably below</p>
<p>the typical intake during periods of infection,</p>
<p>perhaps, perhaps, I should say,</p>
<p>can enhance the glymphatic system and vice versa.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;ve got this specialized sleep</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s related to sickness behavior</p>
<p>that seems to have heightened levels of serotonin</p>
<p>that might be augmented by increasing,</p>
<p>excuse me, that might be augmented by ingesting 5-HTP.</p>
<p>Again, not on a regular basis.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t suggest that people take compounds</p>
<p>that increase serotonin unless it&rsquo;s prescribed to you</p>
<p>for depression or something,</p>
<p>but not doing it by supplement with tryptophan or 5-HTP</p>
<p>on a regular basis, but only under conditions where,</p>
<p>as I mentioned, you might be starting to feel sick</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re coming down with something</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re combating some sort of infection.</p>
<p>So if we consider the advice that we typically get</p>
<p>when we&rsquo;re not feeling well of take a hot shower,</p>
<p>get into bed and go to sleep,</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ve now touched on ways to potentially increase</p>
<p>the efficacy of the sleep part</p>
<p>through the glymphatic and the serotonin system,</p>
<p>what about the take a hot shower part?</p>
<p>Is that good advice?</p>
<p>Well, it turns out it is</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s actually a way to do even better.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a study, very interesting study.</p>
<p>The title reveals where I&rsquo;m going with this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s effect of a single finish sauna session</p>
<p>on white blood cell profile and cortisol levels.</p>
<p>In this case, it was done in athletes and non-athletes,</p>
<p>which is kind of nice.</p>
<p>This involves taking athletes and non-athletes</p>
<p>and exposing them to sauna.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t particularly hot.</p>
<p>It was 96 degrees, which isn&rsquo;t cool,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not really hot.</p>
<p>Nowadays, you hear about people doing very, very hot sauna.</p>
<p>The humidity of the sauna, if you want to know,</p>
<p>is 15 plus or minus 3%,</p>
<p>but basically what they found was that</p>
<p>just one 15-minute sauna session</p>
<p>could really increase white blood cell profiles</p>
<p>and could adjust cortisol levels</p>
<p>in ways that were beneficial for combating infection.</p>
<p>And now there are many other studies like this.</p>
<p>Now, this should immediately make sense</p>
<p>based on what we said before about fever.</p>
<p>Heating up can actually help combat infection.</p>
<p>But for those of you that have listened</p>
<p>to the episodes on temperature,</p>
<p>what you probably know is that when you get into a sauna</p>
<p>or any kind of hot environment,</p>
<p>your body is also going to be actively pushing</p>
<p>to cool itself off.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s probably an increase in heat.</p>
<p>There is an increase in heating</p>
<p>that then afterwards your body will cool off,</p>
<p>maybe even with a dip below baseline.</p>
<p>I do want to provide a cautionary note</p>
<p>that if you are already running a fever,</p>
<p>getting into a sauna could take your body temperature</p>
<p>into dangerously high levels,</p>
<p>dangerously meaning you can kill neurons.</p>
<p>And once you kill neurons, they do not come back.</p>
<p>So please don&rsquo;t kill your neurons.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t recommend getting into a sauna</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re already running a fever.</p>
<p>So this would be something to do</p>
<p>at the initial stage of an infection</p>
<p>or if you&rsquo;re feeling a little bit off.</p>
<p>So this is kind of a ramping up</p>
<p>or a super protocol of the typical advice</p>
<p>of take a hot shower and get into bed.</p>
<p>That is good advice.</p>
<p>Now we&rsquo;re talking about a hot sauna, probably showering off,</p>
<p>and then getting into bed, maybe augmenting serotonin.</p>
<p>I know many people don&rsquo;t have access to sauna.</p>
<p>So in that case, a very hot bath or shower,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t scald yourself, of course,</p>
<p>but as hot as you can comfortably tolerate</p>
<p>or right at that edge of what you can tolerate</p>
<p>would be a good idea.</p>
<p>Some people I&rsquo;ve heard are creating saunas</p>
<p>in their bathrooms by running hot water</p>
<p>and creating a ton of steam.</p>
<p>So anything that really heats you up</p>
<p>but not to dangerously high levels</p>
<p>is going to be beneficial.</p>
<p>If you have access to a sauna, terrific.</p>
<p>This again was only 15 minutes.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;d had a cool off session.</p>
<p>Would you get more of an increase?</p>
<p>People always want to know if you did it twice as much,</p>
<p>would you get twice the increase?</p>
<p>Those data don&rsquo;t really exist yet.</p>
<p>However, if you are interested</p>
<p>in maximizing the effects of sauna,</p>
<p>it is clear that a cool off period is important.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not that a 15 minute sauna is good</p>
<p>and a 30 minute sauna is better.</p>
<p>If you are going to take that route of exploring more,</p>
<p>it does seem that doing a 15 minute heating period</p>
<p>followed by a five to 10 minute cooling period</p>
<p>and then getting back into the heat can be beneficial.</p>
<p>And this is interesting.</p>
<p>It gets to the mechanisms by which the hypothalamus</p>
<p>that areas, the areas of the hypothalamus,</p>
<p>that is that generate increases in body heat.</p>
<p>The activation of those neurons</p>
<p>occurs as you heat up.</p>
<p>And then were you to just stay in that heated environment,</p>
<p>they would actually shut off</p>
<p>and some other neurons would be handling the job,</p>
<p>so to speak.</p>
<p>But by getting in and out of the heated environment,</p>
<p>you actually force that system to send repeated pulses</p>
<p>of these cortisol lowering</p>
<p>and white cell stimulating signals to the body.</p>
<p>Some of you have probably heard the phrase,</p>
<p>feed a fever, starve a cold.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know who first said that.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t find the citation,</p>
<p>but we hear this and we can speculate</p>
<p>that the reason that phrase,</p>
<p>feed a fever, starve a cold came to be</p>
<p>is because of the adaptive function of fever</p>
<p>that increases in body temperature,</p>
<p>make it challenging for intruding viruses</p>
<p>and bacteria to survive.</p>
<p>Even though of course,</p>
<p>highly elevated body temperatures pose a danger</p>
<p>to the host organism, to you.</p>
<p>So feeding, eating does cause an increase in body temperature</p>
<p>through the so-called thermogenic effect of food.</p>
<p>So I can understand the logic of feed a fever.</p>
<p>It would mean that when you have a fever,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s your body&rsquo;s natural attempt to heat up</p>
<p>and kill some invading thing.</p>
<p>And by eating,</p>
<p>you would further increase your body temperature.</p>
<p>Why you would want to starve a cold, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>However, maybe it&rsquo;s because</p>
<p>when your nasal passages are congested,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s uncomfortable to eat or something of that sort.</p>
<p>So the feed a fever part makes sense to me,</p>
<p>that the starve a cold part is still mysterious to me.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t find any logical reason why that would be good.</p>
<p>There are communities out there that believe</p>
<p>that fasting is a viable way</p>
<p>to combat certain types of infection.</p>
<p>Fasting, in particular, prolonged fast</p>
<p>do increase the amount of adrenaline,</p>
<p>also called epinephrine, in the brain and body.</p>
<p>And as we&rsquo;ll next explain,</p>
<p>epinephrine, adrenaline, does have a powerful effect</p>
<p>on the various inflammatory cytokines</p>
<p>and on the immune system in general.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about a behavioral protocol</p>
<p>that anyone can use.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t involve any equipment.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need a sauna.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need anything at all</p>
<p>that has been demonstrated</p>
<p>in excellent peer-reviewed research</p>
<p>to enhance the function of the immune system</p>
<p>and actually allow people to combat infection</p>
<p>in very dramatic ways.</p>
<p>Next, I&rsquo;d like to do an in-depth analysis of a study</p>
<p>that has achieved some prominence out there,</p>
<p>not just in the scientific literature, but on the internet,</p>
<p>because it relates to how particular types of breathing</p>
<p>can impact the immune system</p>
<p>and the ability to combat infection.</p>
<p>The title of this paper is</p>
<p>Voluntary Activation of the Sympathetic Nervous System</p>
<p>and Attenuation of the Innate Immune Response in Humans.</p>
<p>This is a paper that was published in PNAS,</p>
<p>which is the proceedings</p>
<p>of the National Academy of Sciences USA.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very prestigious journal.</p>
<p>For those of you that know PNAS,</p>
<p>you know that there are certain papers published in PNAS,</p>
<p>or there used to be that were not peer-reviewed.</p>
<p>In recent years,</p>
<p>I think all of them have moved to peer-reviewed papers.</p>
<p>So this is a peer-reviewed, very high-quality study.</p>
<p>And I just want to describe the basic contour of the study.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll explain the findings,</p>
<p>and then I want to go in depth</p>
<p>and explain the mechanistic basis for these findings</p>
<p>and the protocol that we can all export from these findings.</p>
<p>So here we go.</p>
<p>First of all, a couple of terms</p>
<p>so that everybody is on the same page.</p>
<p>The sympathetic nervous system</p>
<p>is one division of our nervous system.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a set of neurons</p>
<p>down the middle of our spinal cord and in our brain</p>
<p>that generally lead to a heightened state</p>
<p>of arousal and alertness.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s associated with epinephrine release in the brain</p>
<p>and adrenaline release in the body.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the so-called fight-or-flight system</p>
<p>when it&rsquo;s really active,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s the system that&rsquo;s active when we are wide awake.</p>
<p>And we already talked about the innate immune system.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s that first line of defense</p>
<p>after the skin barrier, of course,</p>
<p>whereby some infection comes into the body</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s this rapid response of increasing inflammation.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s also about the time that you first feel lousy.</p>
<p>So when you start to feel like,</p>
<p>oh, I think I&rsquo;ve got something.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t feel right, a headache.</p>
<p>I feel nauseous, I&rsquo;m heating up.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t feel good.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the innate immune system kicking in.</p>
<p>So what they did in this study,</p>
<p>and by the way, I should say they,</p>
<p>this is the first author is Cox, K-O-X.</p>
<p>Last author, last name Pickers, P-I-C-K-K-E-R-S.</p>
<p>What they did was they exposed human subjects</p>
<p>to an endotoxin.</p>
<p>In other words, they injected people with E. coli.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a bacteria, which makes people,</p>
<p>all people feel terrible.</p>
<p>See, nauseous, fever, vomiting, diarrhea.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very unpleasant, okay?</p>
<p>These people voluntarily signed up for this study.</p>
<p>However, some of the subjects in this study</p>
<p>performed a behavioral protocol</p>
<p>that can best be described as cyclic hyperventilation.</p>
<p>My lab works on these types of breathing protocols.</p>
<p>This is not work that my lab did,</p>
<p>but basically subjects hyperventilate,</p>
<p>followed by breath retention, by breath holds.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll explain exactly what they did.</p>
<p>They also looked at other forms of behavioral protocols,</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s focus on that one.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re comparing controls</p>
<p>that do just sort of a basic meditation</p>
<p>versus people that do this intense breathing,</p>
<p>followed by some breath holds.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just paraphrasing here.</p>
<p>In the intervention group, the breathing group,</p>
<p>plasma levels of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10,</p>
<p>so this is a cytokine that lowers inflammation,</p>
<p>increased after endotoxin administration.</p>
<p>And that was triggered by an increase in epinephrine,</p>
<p>an adrenaline.</p>
<p>So in other words,</p>
<p>doing a particular pattern of breathing</p>
<p>allowed an anti-inflammatory cytokine to be turned on,</p>
<p>whereas that was not the case in the subjects</p>
<p>that did not do this particular breathing protocol.</p>
<p>And they discovered that levels of pro-inflammatory TNF-alpha</p>
<p>tumor necrosis factor alpha, IL-6, interleukin-6,</p>
<p>and interleukin-8,</p>
<p>which you should all be familiar with now,</p>
<p>as pro-inflammatory cytokines</p>
<p>were lower in the intervention group</p>
<p>whereas these IL-10 levels</p>
<p>that are anti-inflammatory went up.</p>
<p>Finally, flu-like symptoms were lower</p>
<p>in the intervention group.</p>
<p>So this is an amazing finding, right?</p>
<p>These are human subjects.</p>
<p>One group of subjects is doing this breathing protocol.</p>
<p>The other group of subjects is just meditating.</p>
<p>They both, both sets of subjects</p>
<p>have been injected with E. coli.</p>
<p>So you know everyone&rsquo;s getting the same amount</p>
<p>placed into their system.</p>
<p>This is very, very interesting.</p>
<p>And it leads to the question that every good scientist,</p>
<p>two-year-old, or health information seeker asks,</p>
<p>which is why?</p>
<p>How?</p>
<p>How in the world does this work?</p>
<p>Why does this work?</p>
<p>Well, to make a long story short-ish,</p>
<p>because I am going to go into depth here,</p>
<p>the reason it works is because</p>
<p>the sympathetic nervous system,</p>
<p>the so-called stress part of our nervous system,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not really called that,</p>
<p>but the part of our nervous system that triggers stress</p>
<p>from mild stress to severe stress, even to panic,</p>
<p>causes the release of adrenaline and epinephrine</p>
<p>in the brain and body.</p>
<p>And under normal circumstances,</p>
<p>when we have some sort of invading infection,</p>
<p>our body is able to push back on that,</p>
<p>to resist it by engaging the stress response.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s happening here is there&rsquo;s a behavioral protocol</p>
<p>involving the nervous system,</p>
<p>because all behaviors are generated</p>
<p>from the nervous system, of course,</p>
<p>a behavioral protocol that people are deliberately employing</p>
<p>that allows them to activate the sympathetic nervous system,</p>
<p>which in turn allows them to activate the normal pathways</p>
<p>by which immune system function is enhanced, okay?</p>
<p>Now, the reason I&rsquo;m underscoring this</p>
<p>is that the common interpretation of this study</p>
<p>is that somehow it blocks the normal immune response,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s not really what&rsquo;s happening here.</p>
<p>Yes, there&rsquo;s a reduction in inflammatory cytokines,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s an increase in anti-inflammatory cytokines,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s not really the same thing</p>
<p>as blocking the immune response.</p>
<p>This could just as easily be viewed</p>
<p>as enhancing the immune response</p>
<p>and combating the intruder, in this case, E. coli.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s parse this study a little bit more closely.</p>
<p>First of all, what is this magical pattern of breathing?</p>
<p>Some of you may recognize this</p>
<p>as so-called Wim Hof breathing,</p>
<p>Wim, of course, the Dutchman.</p>
<p>I think his occupation online</p>
<p>used to be listed as daredevil, believe it or not.</p>
<p>On Wikipedia, that&rsquo;s a pretty cool occupation.</p>
<p>Wim is best known for his activities with cold exposure.</p>
<p>He holds multiple world records for that,</p>
<p>swimming under icebergs and other incredible feats</p>
<p>that you definitely don&rsquo;t want to try</p>
<p>unless you&rsquo;re extremely skilled</p>
<p>and really know what you&rsquo;re doing as he does,</p>
<p>but also for the use of breath work.</p>
<p>The breathing that is so-called Wim Hof breathing</p>
<p>is very similar, not exactly the same,</p>
<p>but very similar to TUMO breathing</p>
<p>as it&rsquo;s been described historically</p>
<p>in the science and physiology community</p>
<p>and in my laboratory, because I run a university laboratory,</p>
<p>we refer to it as cyclic hyperventilation,</p>
<p>which just means repeated deep breaths in and out,</p>
<p>and then there are these retentions.</p>
<p>So because I&rsquo;m here in the hot sea anyway,</p>
<p>I might as well demonstrate it for you</p>
<p>so you know what this looks like.</p>
<p>There are variations on this.</p>
<p>So with respect to Wim, with respect to TUMO practitioners,</p>
<p>with respect to the cyclic hyperventilators everywhere,</p>
<p>this is one general theme of it.</p>
<p>It involves 20 to 30 deep inhales</p>
<p>and then exhales through the mouth,</p>
<p>followed by a exhale of all one&rsquo;s air and a breath hold.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the retention.</p>
<p>And then at some point, 15 to 60 seconds later,</p>
<p>repeating the 25 or 30 breaths,</p>
<p>and then again, a breath hold with lungs empty.</p>
<p>There are variations on this, but in our laboratory</p>
<p>and in this particular study, it looks something like this.</p>
<p>Okay, I&rsquo;m not going to do the whole thing right now,</p>
<p>but it goes something like this.</p>
<p>Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.</p>
<p>Okay, so let&rsquo;s assume I did that for 30 breaths.</p>
<p>I can already feel myself perspiring a little bit.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re heating up, that&rsquo;s the release of adrenaline.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s caused by that breathing pattern.</p>
<p>And then exhaling all of one&rsquo;s air,</p>
<p>no speaking in between like I&rsquo;m doing.</p>
<p>Ah.</p>
<p>And then sitting lungs empty</p>
<p>until one feels the impulse to breathe,</p>
<p>and then repeating for several rounds,</p>
<p>two or three or even four rounds.</p>
<p>Now, some people will also introduce</p>
<p>a big inhale and breath hold at the end</p>
<p>and find that indeed they can hold their breath</p>
<p>much longer than they normally would be able to</p>
<p>because the trigger to breathe is normally activated</p>
<p>by increases in carbon dioxide in our blood.</p>
<p>We have neurons in our brainstem</p>
<p>and in our various regions of our brain actually</p>
<p>that respond to when carbon dioxide is too high</p>
<p>and trigger the reflex to breathe.</p>
<p>But when we exhale deeply,</p>
<p>we blow off a lot of carbon dioxide</p>
<p>so we don&rsquo;t feel that impulse to breathe come quite as soon.</p>
<p>Basically, this study looked at people doing</p>
<p>these cyclic hyperventilation with retention,</p>
<p>25 or 30 breaths, then the retention,</p>
<p>25 or 30 breaths, then retention,</p>
<p>25 or 30 breaths, then the retention.</p>
<p>So three rounds of 25 to 30 breaths</p>
<p>followed by exhale hold in between of various duration,</p>
<p>but in general, 15 to 60 seconds is typical.</p>
<p>What happened physiologically?</p>
<p>This is one of the reasons I like this study.</p>
<p>What happened physiologically?</p>
<p>Well, a couple of things.</p>
<p>Coarse blood oxygenation drops.</p>
<p>You would expect that based on hyperventilation</p>
<p>and especially based on the exhale of so much carbon dioxide.</p>
<p>We could explain why that is,</p>
<p>but blood levels of oxygen drop.</p>
<p>The pH, the alkalinity of the body goes way up.</p>
<p>This is very interesting.</p>
<p>If you look up this paper,</p>
<p>you can look at figure one, panel C,</p>
<p>the pH goes way up.</p>
<p>People become alkaline.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve heard before of alkaline water.</p>
<p>I hate to say this.</p>
<p>I probably lose some friends for this,</p>
<p>but yeah, don&rsquo;t waste your money on drinking alkaline water.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t really shift the alkalinity of your body.</p>
<p>There are cases where some compartment in your body</p>
<p>needs to be more alkaline than the rest.</p>
<p>Your gut is a different alkalinity</p>
<p>than other areas of your body, et cetera,</p>
<p>but ingesting high alkaline water</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t going to shift your overall alkalinity.</p>
<p>If someone can send me a quality reference</p>
<p>that shows different,</p>
<p>then I&rsquo;m happy to revise that statement.</p>
<p>But in any case,</p>
<p>doing that pattern of breathing that I just described</p>
<p>greatly increases a pH.</p>
<p>Greatly, I should say,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t send it off into dangerous levels.</p>
<p>It takes it from 7.4 to 7.6,</p>
<p>which is a significant increase in alkalinity.</p>
<p>So as pH levels,</p>
<p>for those of you who remember high school</p>
<p>or college chemistry,</p>
<p>as the numbers on the pH go down,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re becoming more acidic.</p>
<p>As they go up, you&rsquo;re becoming more alkaline, okay,</p>
<p>or more basic.</p>
<p>So you go from seven,</p>
<p>these subjects went from 7.4 to 7.6 during the breathing,</p>
<p>and then afterwards it returned to normal.</p>
<p>But that shift in alkalinity</p>
<p>is thought to be important here.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s going on here?</p>
<p>How is the breathing leading to these shifts in,</p>
<p>or I should say reduction in inflammatory cytokines</p>
<p>and an increase in the liberation</p>
<p>of these anti-inflammatory cytokines?</p>
<p>Well, the authors make some good arguments</p>
<p>as to why it&rsquo;s not the shift in pH per se,</p>
<p>or the shift in carbon dioxide levels in the blood,</p>
<p>but rather it&rsquo;s the release of epinephrine.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s some good reason to believe why that&rsquo;s the case.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s beyond the scope of this discussion,</p>
<p>but that it&rsquo;s actually the release of epinephrine,</p>
<p>aka adrenaline,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s causing this reduction in inflammation.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s actually supported</p>
<p>by something that you&rsquo;ve probably experienced before,</p>
<p>which is if you&rsquo;ve ever worked, worked, worked,</p>
<p>worked really hard,</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;ve been a caretaker for somebody else</p>
<p>or studying for exams,</p>
<p>and people around you are getting sick</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re just powering through it,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re not getting sick,</p>
<p>but then you stop,</p>
<p>you turn in your final exam,</p>
<p>you stop taking care of somebody else,</p>
<p>or you finally stop and rest,</p>
<p>or you go on vacation and then you get sick.</p>
<p>Well, you&rsquo;ve just experienced the effect</p>
<p>that adrenaline, epinephrine can have</p>
<p>in activating your immune system</p>
<p>by way of the nervous system</p>
<p>in order to keep fighting and combating infection.</p>
<p>And that brings us to a larger theme,</p>
<p>which is that stress and combating infection or a wound</p>
<p>is not one unique system.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same stress system</p>
<p>that you use to combat psychological stress.</p>
<p>So when you&rsquo;re very, very stressed,</p>
<p>at least in the short term,</p>
<p>because you release so much adrenaline and epinephrine,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re actually better able to combat infections</p>
<p>and you reduce inflammation</p>
<p>and the whole feeling lousy response, right?</p>
<p>Remember, reduced flu-like symptoms here.</p>
<p>So this pattern of breathing is actually a very useful tool.</p>
<p>And I confess, I use this pattern of breathing</p>
<p>anytime I am at the initial stages</p>
<p>of getting some sort of bug.</p>
<p>If I feel like I&rsquo;ve been running myself ragged,</p>
<p>or if I somehow, for whatever reason,</p>
<p>have a tickle in my throat,</p>
<p>or I have that kind of sensation in my nose,</p>
<p>like I might have caught a bug of some sort,</p>
<p>I will do this pattern of breathing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been doing it consistently, gosh,</p>
<p>for the last four years or more.</p>
<p>You know, now this is just anecdotal reports,</p>
<p>but I find that it allows me indeed</p>
<p>to either have those early symptoms disappear,</p>
<p>or it allows me to just kind of push through</p>
<p>and harder longer.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t suggest people continue to push through</p>
<p>exposure to infections.</p>
<p>Obviously, you don&rsquo;t want to infect other people,</p>
<p>nor do you want to crash and suddenly get a massive illness</p>
<p>of some sort because you stopped doing this breathing.</p>
<p>But I do think it&rsquo;s a useful tool.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a purely behavioral intervention</p>
<p>that has been shown here,</p>
<p>and now there are additional studies on the way</p>
<p>to enhance the function of your immune system</p>
<p>and to reduce inflammation.</p>
<p>And this is, to me,</p>
<p>one of the most concrete examples of a zero cost tool</p>
<p>that bridges the activation of the nervous system</p>
<p>through breathing with the immune system</p>
<p>by way of releasing adrenaline</p>
<p>and thereby reducing the terrible effects</p>
<p>or feelings of lousiness from a,</p>
<p>in this case, an E. coli infection.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;d like to focus on a couple of important points</p>
<p>that I haven&rsquo;t heard discussed broadly elsewhere,</p>
<p>which is that the hyperventilation</p>
<p>and the breath retention are both important.</p>
<p>So you can&rsquo;t simply hyperventilate to get this effect</p>
<p>at the level of epinephrine release</p>
<p>and reduction in inflammatory cytokines.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been shown before that the hyperventilation phase</p>
<p>and the hypoxia, which is a low oxygen saturation</p>
<p>due to the breath retention,</p>
<p>they both combine to increase epinephrine adrenaline levels.</p>
<p>So you have to do the 25 or 30 breaths</p>
<p>and then the retention 25 or 30 breaths,</p>
<p>then the retention,</p>
<p>meaning that the exhale with the breath hold</p>
<p>in order to get the full effect.</p>
<p>I also want to provide a critical cautionary note.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t do this anywhere near water or while driving a car.</p>
<p>These things might seem kind of obvious,</p>
<p>but obviously in the off chance that you black out</p>
<p>or something like that, it could be disastrous.</p>
<p>So please be careful.</p>
<p>And again, don&rsquo;t try and push the breath hold.</p>
<p>The moment you feel the impulse to breathe, just breathe.</p>
<p>And it did seem that the three rounds of 25 to 30 breaths</p>
<p>with interventions, excuse me,</p>
<p>with breath hold retentions in between</p>
<p>was the ideal protocol.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s one last very interesting feature of this study</p>
<p>that I want to emphasize.</p>
<p>And that was that they actually measured</p>
<p>the so-called catecholamine concentrations.</p>
<p>Catecholamines are things like dopamine,</p>
<p>epinephrine, norepinephrine.</p>
<p>These are chemicals in your nervous system</p>
<p>and body that promote states of alertness.</p>
<p>Dopamine, of course,</p>
<p>is part of the reward and motivation pathways.</p>
<p>They explored the levels of these molecules in blood,</p>
<p>in plasma, during and after this breathing protocol.</p>
<p>And it was interesting, as I mentioned before,</p>
<p>epinephrine showed robust increases</p>
<p>compared to the control group.</p>
<p>Norepinephrine, significant increases occurred</p>
<p>in the breathing group,</p>
<p>but in the cyclic hyperventilation retention breathing group,</p>
<p>of course, but less so.</p>
<p>And dopamine levels actually dropped somewhat.</p>
<p>But this is very interesting</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s a new and emerging literature,</p>
<p>largely from ISA, A-Y-S-A, Roll&rsquo;s lab in Israel.</p>
<p>What her laboratory has shown is that</p>
<p>motivational state and mindset has a powerful impact</p>
<p>on various aspects of the immune system</p>
<p>that were thought to be independent</p>
<p>of the brain and mind and thinking.</p>
<p>So this brings us back to something that we discussed</p>
<p>at the very beginning of this episode,</p>
<p>which is that 20, 30 years ago,</p>
<p>the idea that you could heal the body with the mind</p>
<p>was considered kind of quackery.</p>
<p>I think that there was an intervening period up until now</p>
<p>where people might&rsquo;ve said,</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Sure, if you&rsquo;re stressed out,</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;it&rsquo;s going to make things worse.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>I mean, I think everyone agrees</p>
<p>that stress makes everything worse at some level.</p>
<p>Outcomes to neurodegeneration,</p>
<p>performance in physical endeavors and mental endeavors.</p>
<p>If stress is too high for too long,</p>
<p>people experience different challenges</p>
<p>and essentially every major psychiatric disorder,</p>
<p>everything suffers.</p>
<p>But in the short term,</p>
<p>stress can actually be beneficial</p>
<p>in the ways that we just described.</p>
<p>And stress, if we break it down,</p>
<p>is really a neurochemical state, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the release of these catecholamines.</p>
<p>And what Issa Rolls&rsquo;s laboratory has shown</p>
<p>is that when the so-called dopamine system,</p>
<p>and at several episodes I described,</p>
<p>there are multiple dopamine systems,</p>
<p>but the so-called mesolimbic reward pathway</p>
<p>involving areas like the nucleus accumbens, et cetera,</p>
<p>when the reward system that&rsquo;s associated with dopamine</p>
<p>and norepinephrine is activated,</p>
<p>you see incredible effects,</p>
<p>including, for instance,</p>
<p>highly significant reduction in tumor size in cancers.</p>
<p>Now, why would that be?</p>
<p>How is it that mindset, dopamine, and tumors,</p>
<p>and tumor growth are somehow linked?</p>
<p>We now know how this occurs,</p>
<p>largely through the incredible work of Issa Rolls and others.</p>
<p>So now I&rsquo;d like to turn our focus</p>
<p>to how it is specifically that certain mindsets</p>
<p>impact the immune system</p>
<p>in ways that we can actually point</p>
<p>to specific biological pathways</p>
<p>and also specific protocols related to mindset.</p>
<p>I guess a simple way to frame all this</p>
<p>would be to say that most of us are aware that,</p>
<p>yes, indeed, you can worry yourself sick.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been told that.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to worry yourself sick.</p>
<p>And actually, there was a paper published in Science,</p>
<p>again, one of the top three journals out there,</p>
<p>the top three really being Nature, Science, and Cell.</p>
<p>And then other, of course, excellent journals exist,</p>
<p>but this was a paper that came out in Science</p>
<p>last year.</p>
<p>First author is Kataoka, K-A-T-A-O-K-A,</p>
<p>describing psychogenic stress and fever.</p>
<p>So this was looking or asking the question,</p>
<p>are there areas of the brain that actually underlie</p>
<p>this notion that we can worry ourselves sick?</p>
<p>And they discovered a new pathway,</p>
<p>and they were able to both activate this pathway</p>
<p>independent of worry and stress and see illness occur.</p>
<p>And they were able to inhibit this pathway,</p>
<p>block activity in this neural pathway,</p>
<p>and prevent psychogenic fever</p>
<p>and the worrying of oneself sick.</p>
<p>So they were able to do this in a very controlled way.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just mention the pathway</p>
<p>in case you want to look it up in more detail.</p>
<p>This is a corticolimbic pathway.</p>
<p>So just to orient us,</p>
<p>the cortex is more or less the outer shell of the brain.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s involved in thinking and sensation and perceptions</p>
<p>and learning and maintenance of a lot of memories</p>
<p>are stored there.</p>
<p>We all hear that you learn and remember in the hippocampus,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the initial site of learning and memory.</p>
<p>But then that information, believe it or not,</p>
<p>is passed off to the cortex where it&rsquo;s stored</p>
<p>in kind of a long-term hard drive type storage.</p>
<p>So the corticolimbic pathway is one in which your thoughts,</p>
<p>your prior experiences can literally in a structural way,</p>
<p>feed down onto the areas of the brain</p>
<p>that control very basal processes,</p>
<p>including temperature regulation.</p>
<p>So this is a corticolimbic hypothalamic pathway.</p>
<p>We talked earlier about the hypothalamus</p>
<p>as controlling temperature</p>
<p>and a lot of sickness-related behavior, right?</p>
<p>Remember Vegas up to the hypothalamus</p>
<p>and all the sleep more, less appetite, fever, okay?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all in the hypothalamus.</p>
<p>This is a top-down corticolimbic hypothalamic pathway,</p>
<p>and it has a fancy name.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the dorsal peduncular cortex, dorsal tinea tecta.</p>
<p>The short of that is the DPDTT.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s just call it the DPDTT</p>
<p>to the dorsal medial hypothalamus.</p>
<p>Not a lot of Ds.</p>
<p>It shouldn&rsquo;t mean anything.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t really matter what we call it,</p>
<p>but what&rsquo;s important is conceptually,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a pathway that originates in sites of the brain</p>
<p>that are associated with thinking,</p>
<p>with emotion, and with prior history,</p>
<p>and feeds directly into an area of the brain</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s involved in basic physiological,</p>
<p>subconsciously controlled processes.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s incredible, right?</p>
<p>And it points to a physical pathway</p>
<p>by which the way we think about something</p>
<p>changes something core about our physiology.</p>
<p>Now, in some ways that shouldn&rsquo;t be surprising, right?</p>
<p>If you think about something that excites you,</p>
<p>your heart rate can increase.</p>
<p>You think about something that terrifies you,</p>
<p>your heart rate can increase.</p>
<p>So the idea that thinking controls our physiology</p>
<p>is not a new concept at all,</p>
<p>but somehow human beings,</p>
<p>we have been challenged with the idea</p>
<p>that we could actually think ourselves into being sick.</p>
<p>But this paper from Kataoka shows</p>
<p>that if you expose somebody to a psychological stress,</p>
<p>you can actually activate this pathway and create a fever.</p>
<p>And how do they do that?</p>
<p>Well, you can do this by exposing subjects</p>
<p>to a very stressful real event,</p>
<p>and you cue it through associative learning.</p>
<p>So maybe, you know, like my pilot V5s,</p>
<p>which I love so much,</p>
<p>you know, we could traumatize me to the pilot V5</p>
<p>if I had some horrible experience happen to me</p>
<p>while I&rsquo;m looking at and concentrating on the pilot V5,</p>
<p>then you take away the horrible experience,</p>
<p>you give me the pilot V5,</p>
<p>and I start to experience a lot of the symptoms</p>
<p>associated with that terrible event.</p>
<p>They were able to do this</p>
<p>using sickness-inducing stimuli and so forth.</p>
<p>They did all the various derivations</p>
<p>and identified this pathway that when activated,</p>
<p>even in the absence of some horrible event,</p>
<p>could create fever and illness-like behavior and so forth.</p>
<p>And if they blocked certain stations</p>
<p>along this neural pathway, they could block that effect.</p>
<p>So this is really concrete evidence, proof, if you will,</p>
<p>that there are dedicated pathways in the mammalian brain,</p>
<p>your brain and mine,</p>
<p>that allow us to turn thoughts into illness.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s kind of a depressing idea.</p>
<p>What about the inverse?</p>
<p>What about turning thoughts into health?</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s the work of ISA Rolls.</p>
<p>They explored the well-established psychological phenomenon</p>
<p>that when cancer patients or very ill people</p>
<p>or people who are suffering from very debilitating injuries,</p>
<p>when people had or reported a sense of hope,</p>
<p>their rates of recovery were much higher, right?</p>
<p>Sounds very subjective.</p>
<p>But what is a sense of hope?</p>
<p>A sense of hope is a sense of the future.</p>
<p>A sense of the future is tightly associated</p>
<p>with the dopamine system.</p>
<p>Dopamine, again, being this molecule of reward</p>
<p>and motivation and movement,</p>
<p>but movement and motivation are about things</p>
<p>that are beyond the confines of our skin</p>
<p>and are about the future.</p>
<p>And so what they&rsquo;ve discovered</p>
<p>and through other studies from other groups have discovered</p>
<p>is that stimulation of the dopamine pathway,</p>
<p>either simply by thinking about a future,</p>
<p>ideally a positive future,</p>
<p>but thinking about a positive future leads to activation</p>
<p>of this so-called mesolimbic reward pathway</p>
<p>and could reduce the size of tumors,</p>
<p>could accelerate wound healing,</p>
<p>could greatly accelerate the passage from a state of illness</p>
<p>to a state of health and wellbeing.</p>
<p>So there are many, many studies now starting</p>
<p>to wick out related to this.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also the idea that augmenting the dopamine system</p>
<p>can increase the rate of healing.</p>
<p>And so there are individuals out there who opt,</p>
<p>for instance, to take things that increase dopamine.</p>
<p>Now, obviously drugs of abuse would not be a good idea</p>
<p>in this context, even though they increase dopamine,</p>
<p>they lead to big crashes,</p>
<p>they have addictive properties, et cetera.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked before on this podcast about things</p>
<p>like L-tyrosine, take it anywhere from 500 to 750 milligrams</p>
<p>can increase dopamine because tyrosine</p>
<p>is a dopamine precursor, of course,</p>
<p>things like mucunipurines, which are L-DOPA,</p>
<p>the immediate precursor to dopamine.</p>
<p>Some of these will lead to somewhat of a crash</p>
<p>in certain individuals,</p>
<p>other people tolerate them a little bit better.</p>
<p>Again, you have to talk to your doctor,</p>
<p>you have to figure out what&rsquo;s right for you.</p>
<p>If you have bipolar or mania or schizophrenia,</p>
<p>these things are, I would not recommend them at all.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not recommending them all,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just mentioning them for potential exploration</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s safe and right for you.</p>
<p>But the point is this, the dopamine system when activated</p>
<p>can accelerate healing, it can accelerate the recovery</p>
<p>from injury of all kinds.</p>
<p>And that shouldn&rsquo;t come as a mystery</p>
<p>or a surprise result to us.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because this reward pathway and the fact</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s related to a sense of the future</p>
<p>seems to liberate entire systems within the body</p>
<p>that make inflammatory cytokines go down</p>
<p>and anti-inflammatory cytokines go up,</p>
<p>exactly as was demonstrated in the beautiful PNAS study</p>
<p>where breathing, cyclic hyperventilation was used</p>
<p>to increase epinephrine, increase norepinephrine</p>
<p>and to augment the catecholamine system.</p>
<p>So I think that the bridges between these studies</p>
<p>are really relevant.</p>
<p>In one case, I&rsquo;m talking about potentially taking</p>
<p>an over-the-counter compound to increase dopamine</p>
<p>to accelerate healing.</p>
<p>In another case, we&rsquo;re talking about using breathing.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also the use of cold water exposure</p>
<p>to increase dopamine.</p>
<p>I talked about this several episodes ago,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s been shown that immersing oneself in cold water</p>
<p>up to the neck or so, how cold?</p>
<p>Well, it depends on what you can tolerate,</p>
<p>but uncomfortably cold, but not so cold</p>
<p>that you become hypothermic.</p>
<p>But where it&rsquo;s challenging to get in,</p>
<p>but you can stay there for three to 10 minutes or so</p>
<p>has been shown to lead to very significant</p>
<p>doubling or more of baseline dopamine levels</p>
<p>and epinephrine levels that go on for several hours.</p>
<p>This may be the basis for why people will do cold showers</p>
<p>or ice baths and then get into a sauna.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s called cold heat contrast therapy</p>
<p>as a way to augment these neurotransmitters.</p>
<p>Today, we&rsquo;ve been talking about how these neurotransmitters</p>
<p>can be used to enhance the function of the immune system.</p>
<p>And so just keep in mind that anytime you&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about increasing neurotransmitter levels,</p>
<p>that can be done pharmacologically through supplementation</p>
<p>or it can be done behaviorally through exposure</p>
<p>to cold water, for instance,</p>
<p>or it can be done even just simply by breathing</p>
<p>in a particular way,</p>
<p>cyclic hyperventilation followed by retention.</p>
<p>The catecholamines, noradrenaline, dopamine,</p>
<p>and norepinephrine are the bridge of activation</p>
<p>for the immune system and the nervous system.</p>
<p>They are the way that the nervous system calls out</p>
<p>to the immune system,</p>
<p>aha, we have a problem, we need to counter this.</p>
<p>So you can think of them,</p>
<p>them meaning dopamine, epinephrine, and norepinephrine</p>
<p>as being able to deploy larger amounts of immune cells,</p>
<p>all the types of immune cells that we talked about</p>
<p>at the beginning of the episode.</p>
<p>Okay, so thus far, we&rsquo;ve been discussing</p>
<p>how one can prevent getting sick</p>
<p>or when one starts to feel ill,</p>
<p>how one might be able to shorten the course</p>
<p>of that infection by ramping up the activity</p>
<p>of the immune system.</p>
<p>But what about when you&rsquo;re already experiencing symptoms,</p>
<p>the runny nose, stuffed up nose,</p>
<p>congestion, headache, et cetera?</p>
<p>Well, there are many ways to address that</p>
<p>at the symptom level.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re probably aware of all the over-the-counter medications</p>
<p>many of which focus on the epinephrine system,</p>
<p>things that are of the pseudofed variety</p>
<p>prevent or reduce congestion</p>
<p>because of the way that they cause release of epinephrine.</p>
<p>And some of the effects on dilating the bronchioles</p>
<p>and dilating the nasal passages and so forth.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to speak to whether or not</p>
<p>those are good or bad choices.</p>
<p>They do have a couple of effects that are not so great</p>
<p>for the course of treating the underlying cause,</p>
<p>which are, first of all, they can cause dehydration.</p>
<p>So you have to make sure that you&rsquo;re hydrating well,</p>
<p>both fluids and electrolytes.</p>
<p>And they also can interfere with sleep</p>
<p>because as I&rsquo;ve talked about in the episodes on sleep,</p>
<p>one of the hallmarks of deep sleep</p>
<p>and in particular REM sleep</p>
<p>is that epinephrine adrenaline levels are low.</p>
<p>This is what allows you to have intense,</p>
<p>often very emotionally laden dreams during REM sleep</p>
<p>and not act those out.</p>
<p>And low adrenaline epinephrine during REM sleep</p>
<p>is basically a signature, a neurochemical signature</p>
<p>of the REM sleep state,</p>
<p>which is so vital for emotional and physical repair</p>
<p>and so forth.</p>
<p>So the fact that they can inhibit sleep,</p>
<p>the fact that they can cause dehydration,</p>
<p>the fact that they can make people feel</p>
<p>kind of lightheaded and jittery</p>
<p>makes them not terrific choices for a number of people.</p>
<p>There is an interesting alternative choice.</p>
<p>And when I say alternative, I do mean alternative.</p>
<p>The choice that I&rsquo;m referring to is spirulina,</p>
<p>which is actually a form of algae.</p>
<p>Years ago, I think when I first heard about spirulina,</p>
<p>it sounded very much of the kind of 1970s, 80s</p>
<p>health food store variety,</p>
<p>seemed really kind of mystical and wacky.</p>
<p>But actually now there are some really nice studies</p>
<p>and some data and also an understanding of the mechanism</p>
<p>by which spirulina can have potent effects</p>
<p>in reducing what&rsquo;s called rhinitis,</p>
<p>which is a fancy word for congestion of the nose</p>
<p>and inflammation of the nose.</p>
<p>Basically, anytime you hear a word that includes itis,</p>
<p>at least if it&rsquo;s in the medical or health context,</p>
<p>it generally means inflammation of some tissue.</p>
<p>So rhinitis just being inflammation of the nasal passages,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s one of the most uncomfortable symptoms</p>
<p>of any kind of infection.</p>
<p>So there are two studies I&rsquo;d like to highlight</p>
<p>just very quickly.</p>
<p>One is the effects of spirulina on allergic rhinitis</p>
<p>and the other is a clinical comparison</p>
<p>of the efficacy of spirulina platensis,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a technical name,</p>
<p>and cetirizine for the treatment of allergic rhinitis.</p>
<p>These looked at humans, so this is not a mouse study,</p>
<p>this is a study on humans,</p>
<p>both sexes, so males and females.</p>
<p>In one case, looking at 100 plus subjects, 129 subjects,</p>
<p>the other 65 subjects, so a decent number of subjects,</p>
<p>randomized trial, double-blind.</p>
<p>Both cases saw significant decreases in nasal obstruction,</p>
<p>improved ability to smell, improved sleep,</p>
<p>daily working cytokine,</p>
<p>inflammatory cytokines were reduced as well,</p>
<p>reduction nasal itching,</p>
<p>all the stuff that you&rsquo;d like to experience,</p>
<p>I can imagine, after taking two grams,</p>
<p>two grams, not milligrams, but two grams of spirulina.</p>
<p>Sometimes had to be taken for a short while</p>
<p>before the effect kicked in.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s pretty impressive, I would say,</p>
<p>but it doesn&rsquo;t really speak to mechanism,</p>
<p>but in exploring the underlying mechanisms</p>
<p>for spirulina&rsquo;s effects on reducing rhinitis,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s interesting to find that spirulina</p>
<p>actually can inhibit the formation and or activity</p>
<p>of so-called histaminergic mast cells, M-A-S-T, mast cells.</p>
<p>We haven&rsquo;t talked a lot about mast cells,</p>
<p>but they are a very interesting cell type</p>
<p>in the immune response.</p>
<p>Essentially what they are, little packets of histamine,</p>
<p>and when we have some sort of injury</p>
<p>or irritant, rather, to the skin,</p>
<p>so a mosquito bite, for instance,</p>
<p>or poison oak or poison ivy,</p>
<p>something that causes an itch</p>
<p>or something that causes inflammation internally</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t just have to be on the skin.</p>
<p>These mast cells are these little bubbles</p>
<p>that contain histamine that go to that site</p>
<p>and release their histaminergic contents</p>
<p>and cause swelling and inflammation</p>
<p>of whatever cells are affected locally.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s cause, you might think,</p>
<p>well, why would I want to have a mechanism in my body</p>
<p>that would cause swelling and inflammation?</p>
<p>Ah, well, then those cells in turn</p>
<p>send out cytokine signals that recruit</p>
<p>the very cell types that we were talking about</p>
<p>way back at the beginning of the episode,</p>
<p>the cells that are characteristic</p>
<p>of the innate immune system that come in,</p>
<p>the macrophages and the other types of cells</p>
<p>that will come in and gobble up the foreign invaders</p>
<p>or will help sequester and move away,</p>
<p>say, the poison from a bite or from whatever irritant.</p>
<p>Again, it doesn&rsquo;t just have to be at the skin surface.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m describing an example at the skin.</p>
<p>For instance, if you&rsquo;ve ever had hives of any kind,</p>
<p>that almost certainly involved mast cells.</p>
<p>So, and when you take an antihistamine,</p>
<p>antihistamine, in order to deal with seasonal allergies,</p>
<p>for instance, you&rsquo;re dealing, you&rsquo;re, excuse me,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re taking a compound that&rsquo;s reducing histamines</p>
<p>in mast cells.</p>
<p>And spirulina has also been used quite effectively</p>
<p>as a way to treat seasonal allergies</p>
<p>and some of the symptomology equally on par</p>
<p>with some of the major prescription</p>
<p>and over-the-counter drugs for that.</p>
<p>One cautionary note, spirulina does,</p>
<p>can carry some side effects for people</p>
<p>that are, have a genetic mutation</p>
<p>leading to something called PKU.</p>
<p>These people know who they are.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re very sensitive to phenylalanine.</p>
<p>These same people cannot drink any sort of</p>
<p>nutritious read or diet soda</p>
<p>for reasons that they understand.</p>
<p>It could be quite dangerous.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a rare genetic disorder, but nonetheless,</p>
<p>spirulina can be an issue for those people.</p>
<p>For most people, the side effect profile is pretty minimal.</p>
<p>And just to be clear, I don&rsquo;t have any relationship</p>
<p>to a spirulina company or anything.</p>
<p>I just find it interesting that there are these compounds</p>
<p>that sound rather, forgive the phrase,</p>
<p>but rather new agey because they come from a algae,</p>
<p>from a plant.</p>
<p>But when you look at the underlying mechanism,</p>
<p>it makes perfect sense.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s often what we like to point out here</p>
<p>is that if there are these so-called alternative therapies,</p>
<p>alternative because most people haven&rsquo;t heard of them,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s always nice if they map to a specific</p>
<p>logical mechanism and framework</p>
<p>by which that compound would work</p>
<p>as opposed to just some anecdote of,</p>
<p>oh, I hear spirulina is great for allergies.</p>
<p>Well, now we know why.</p>
<p>It inhibits mast cells and histaminergic mast cells</p>
<p>in particular.</p>
<p>Earlier, I mentioned a new and very exciting study</p>
<p>published as a full article in Nature.</p>
<p>Full article means that it is a major finding.</p>
<p>At the journal Nature, they have letters,</p>
<p>which are important findings.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re still very high stringency</p>
<p>for getting a letter in Nature published.</p>
<p>But the full articles, generally,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s only one or two per issue</p>
<p>in the weekly edition of Nature.</p>
<p>And just last week, there was a very exciting article</p>
<p>published from Chufu Ma&rsquo;s lab at Harvard Medical School.</p>
<p>Chufu, I&rsquo;ve known for a number of years.</p>
<p>His group has done phenomenal work</p>
<p>on the mechanisms of itch and pain</p>
<p>and discovering some of the receptors</p>
<p>and pathways for itch and pain.</p>
<p>And more recently, they&rsquo;ve been exploring</p>
<p>the mechanistic basis of acupuncture.</p>
<p>And the title of the article is</p>
<p>a neuroanatomical basis for electroacupuncture</p>
<p>to drive the vagal adrenal axis.</p>
<p>And while that&rsquo;s a mouthful,</p>
<p>now, most all of you are probably familiar</p>
<p>with what I mean when I say vagal adrenal axis.</p>
<p>Vagal meaning of the vagus and adrenal of the adrenal glands.</p>
<p>And so perhaps we should not be surprised,</p>
<p>although excited nonetheless,</p>
<p>that when Chufu&rsquo;s lab looked at stimulation of the body</p>
<p>with so-called electroacupuncture,</p>
<p>so these are needles where it&rsquo;s a small bit</p>
<p>of electrical current, low level of electrical current,</p>
<p>is passed into the needle and therefore into the body.</p>
<p>They located sites on the body that can increase inflammation</p>
<p>by way of releasing inflammatory cytokines.</p>
<p>These areas included the abdomen</p>
<p>and they found areas on the body,</p>
<p>such as the lower limbs or the hind limbs in this case,</p>
<p>that can stimulate the vagal adrenal reflex</p>
<p>and can lead to reduced inflammation.</p>
<p>And what was really interesting</p>
<p>is that they figured out that it was activation</p>
<p>of nerve endings that resided in the fascia.</p>
<p>I mentioned earlier what fascia is,</p>
<p>but just to remind you,</p>
<p>the fascia is a really thick sheath of tissue</p>
<p>that surrounds muscle.</p>
<p>If ever you&rsquo;ve heard of rolfing,</p>
<p>rolfing is a form of very intense massage.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never had this done, but I&rsquo;ve heard about this.</p>
<p>It involves, among other things,</p>
<p>actually separating the muscle away from the fascia somewhat.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a very, very deep tissue massage.</p>
<p>Actually, a good friend of mine who had this done</p>
<p>told me that it was probably the most challenging experience</p>
<p>that physical experience that he&rsquo;d ever been through</p>
<p>going through this rolfing procedure.</p>
<p>Maybe some of you have been rolfed, as they say,</p>
<p>and can report to the experience</p>
<p>whether or not it was pleasant or unpleasant,</p>
<p>or you felt benefits or not.</p>
<p>In any case, this study isn&rsquo;t about rolfing per se,</p>
<p>but it is about the fascia.</p>
<p>And so what they discovered is</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a specific population of neurons.</p>
<p>Those neurons have a name as they often do in science.</p>
<p>Name isn&rsquo;t important, but if you want to look it up,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the PROC-R2 neurons, P-R-O-K-R2 neurons.</p>
<p>And they send a connection deep into the limb fascial tissue.</p>
<p>Okay, and then they send another connection.</p>
<p>The connections we&rsquo;re referring to are axons.</p>
<p>Neurons have axons, so a wire in one direction</p>
<p>that goes into the deep fascial tissue of the lower limb</p>
<p>and near the calf and thigh.</p>
<p>And then they send another wire up into the spinal cord</p>
<p>and to a region of the hind brain</p>
<p>in the back of your brain, kind of near your neck</p>
<p>called the medulla, in the medulla oblongata.</p>
<p>That neuron also has a name called the DMZ, doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>And that neuron connects to the adrenal gland</p>
<p>to release our good old friends,</p>
<p>the catecholamines, noradrenaline, adrenaline, and dopamine,</p>
<p>or norepinephrine, epinephrine, and dopamine.</p>
<p>And their release causes a reduction in inflammation,</p>
<p>even in response to an injection</p>
<p>of something called lipopolysaccharide,</p>
<p>which can actually induce fever.</p>
<p>So what is all this saying?</p>
<p>This is saying that activation of the deep fascial tissue</p>
<p>causes a chain of neural reactions</p>
<p>that leads eventually to the release of norepinephrine,</p>
<p>noradrenaline, adrenaline, and dopamine.</p>
<p>And once again, lowers inflammation,</p>
<p>very much like the breathing study</p>
<p>that we talked about earlier</p>
<p>in the pattern of cyclic hyperventilation with retention,</p>
<p>leading to reductions in inflammation.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t tell you how happy this makes me.</p>
<p>I had nothing to do with this work,</p>
<p>but the reason it makes me happy</p>
<p>is because I have a particular fondness</p>
<p>for when practices that have existed for many centuries</p>
<p>or even thousands of years, such as acupuncture,</p>
<p>such as respiration work, start to converge</p>
<p>with some of the hardcore mechanistic science.</p>
<p>And the reason this excites me</p>
<p>is not because we want to take science</p>
<p>and erase the previous tools and methods</p>
<p>of these ancient practices, not at all.</p>
<p>And it certainly isn&rsquo;t the case</p>
<p>that we just want to name things</p>
<p>or rename things with modern science.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s very exciting is when we can discover mechanism</p>
<p>that explains why certain practices work.</p>
<p>First of all, that validates those as legitimate practices.</p>
<p>Maybe even insurance will start to cover them,</p>
<p>whereas maybe they previously had not.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what the current status is</p>
<p>for insurance coverage of acupuncture.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m guessing there are places that do it,</p>
<p>maybe others that don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I personally am not somebody who receives acupuncture.</p>
<p>I have in the past, but it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m a particular fan of it,</p>
<p>but I think that there are a number of people</p>
<p>that have benefited from it.</p>
<p>So I think that&rsquo;s wonderful.</p>
<p>Breath work and respiration work is something</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve cultivated as a practice over the years.</p>
<p>I mentioned earlier how I use it to push back</p>
<p>on incoming infections and so forth.</p>
<p>And now that doesn&rsquo;t sound like total,</p>
<p>like just a figment of my imagination.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s actually a mechanism,</p>
<p>published mechanism to explain it.</p>
<p>But the most exciting thing to me about all this</p>
<p>is that practices that traditionally have been shrouded</p>
<p>in complicated language or were the unique domain</p>
<p>of the practitioners and relied on phrases</p>
<p>like the meridians or the chakras,</p>
<p>of which I think is perfectly valid language,</p>
<p>but doesn&rsquo;t inform mechanism.</p>
<p>And then in a separate community,</p>
<p>the community I come from, the community of scientists,</p>
<p>have used language like our two neurons,</p>
<p>medulla oblongata, vagal adrenal axis.</p>
<p>And basically no one can communicate with one another</p>
<p>because the language is shrouding.</p>
<p>What we&rsquo;re now starting to see is that</p>
<p>at their convergence is a common mechanism.</p>
<p>And with that understanding,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s going to be really terrific</p>
<p>is as new protocols start to emerge.</p>
<p>So in understanding mechanisms and pathways</p>
<p>and in being able to understand the base set of practices,</p>
<p>like breathing, like electroacupuncture and so forth,</p>
<p>we can now start to daydream in a very realistic way</p>
<p>about the development of new protocols,</p>
<p>more effective protocols,</p>
<p>protocols that perhaps one can do at home without needles,</p>
<p>perhaps protocols such as the breathing</p>
<p>that you can do anywhere, anytime,</p>
<p>and be confident that you&rsquo;re actually impacting</p>
<p>the IL-6 and the IL-8 pathways,</p>
<p>reducing those and increasing IL-10.</p>
<p>So we are no longer wandering around in the fog,</p>
<p>hearing about these magical techniques</p>
<p>without understanding why they work,</p>
<p>nor are we just seeing a bunch of science</p>
<p>that is descriptive, but not mechanistic</p>
<p>or pointing to specific protocols.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m just delighted.</p>
<p>Again, I had nothing to do with this work,</p>
<p>but I really, terrific work, Chufu and colleagues.</p>
<p>And I also want to acknowledge a journal</p>
<p>as prominent as Nature for featuring this upfront,</p>
<p>because I think it really does mark the beginning</p>
<p>of a new path in medicine.</p>
<p>And just to underscore that point a little bit further,</p>
<p>the National Institutes of Health, of course,</p>
<p>has a Cancer Institute, an Eye Institute</p>
<p>that deal with trying to combat cancer</p>
<p>and to cure blindness and so forth.</p>
<p>And now they have what&rsquo;s called NCCIH,</p>
<p>which is Complementary Health.</p>
<p>And so there are good tax dollars being put</p>
<p>to the kinds of explorations that we&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>that undoubtedly are going to lead to better treatments</p>
<p>for immunological diseases, neurological diseases,</p>
<p>the convergence of the immune system and the nervous system,</p>
<p>very exciting times.</p>
<p>And I hope that by learning about some of this new</p>
<p>and emerging science and hearing about some</p>
<p>of the protocols that are either zero cost or low cost,</p>
<p>certainly for respiration, that&rsquo;s the case,</p>
<p>or for the use of heat or cold,</p>
<p>or maybe even electroacupuncture,</p>
<p>if you have access to that,</p>
<p>that we can really see that we&rsquo;re starting to evolve</p>
<p>as a field of health and medicine and science</p>
<p>and ancient practices,</p>
<p>and that they&rsquo;re really starting to converge</p>
<p>and have a vector, as we say,</p>
<p>in a new and more exciting direction.</p>
<p>Once again, we&rsquo;ve covered a lot of information.</p>
<p>Today, we learned about the immune system,</p>
<p>the adaptive immune system, the innate immune system,</p>
<p>and the nervous system and how those interact.</p>
<p>And throughout, we discuss protocols that can allow you</p>
<p>to tap into this relationship between the nervous system</p>
<p>and immune system, and hopefully avoid</p>
<p>and or shorten the course of any illnesses, injuries,</p>
<p>or inflammation that you might encounter.</p>
