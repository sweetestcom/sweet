    <p>Alright, everybody, welcome to episode 94 of all in. This is a</p>
<p>summer unprepared episode. There&rsquo;s not much news. We&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna wing it with me again. In his golfing cap. The rain man</p>
<p>himself. David Sachs, you do okay, buddy? Yeah, that&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>Yeah. All right. I&rsquo;m kind of annoyed that we&rsquo;re taping on a</p>
<p>Wednesday. Yeah, this is a slow news week. It&rsquo;s a slow news.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s not why we&rsquo;re taping on a Wednesday is because</p>
<p>you have to want to go to Burning Man. Well, whatever. I</p>
<p>mean, listen, everybody has to get their burnout. Sachs, have</p>
<p>you ever been to Burning Man? Yeah, I&rsquo;ve been before. Burning</p>
<p>Man. Really? He was there on threesome Thursday. I&rsquo;ve been a</p>
<p>couple of times. I think it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s a cool experience doing</p>
<p>worth doing, you know, once or twice in your life. It&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>something I want to do every year. But I know a lot of people</p>
<p>do like doing it every year. They&rsquo;re like really into it. I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>not really into it that way. But I think it was a worthwhile</p>
<p>experience to go at least once. Jamal, have you been? No,</p>
<p>Freiburg. Have you been? I&rsquo;ve not been. No, I have no desire.</p>
<p>No, I don&rsquo;t like driving in the car for a long period of time.</p>
<p>And well, by the way, I&rsquo;ll tell you, I&rsquo;ll tell you why I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>really have a huge desire to go. I, I don&rsquo;t really have a huge</p>
<p>desire at this point in my life. To want to do a ton of drugs.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not that&rsquo;s not just about that. Really? No, really.</p>
<p>What it&rsquo;s really about is are we joking right now? It&rsquo;s if you</p>
<p>like art and you like music, it&rsquo;s amazing. It&rsquo;s amazing. I</p>
<p>really I really like art. I think I actually collect</p>
<p>phenomenal art. In fact, I like to go to like freeze the</p>
<p>biennale. It would blow your mind. No, no, no, you have no</p>
<p>idea the scale of the art there is tremendous. It is</p>
<p>extraordinary. And if you&rsquo;re into music, we just can we just</p>
<p>call it what it is. It started out as a festival that did</p>
<p>celebrate art and creativity. Yeah. And over time became mass</p>
<p>market. And in order to become mass market, there is still an</p>
<p>element of that. But it&rsquo;s a huge party. And I think people</p>
<p>should just be more honest that it&rsquo;s super fun. You can really</p>
<p>rage for a weekend or for an entire week. And people should</p>
<p>enjoy themselves. But let&rsquo;s not like have to put all these</p>
<p>labels about how like intellectually superior it is and</p>
<p>how you feel like bullshit. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s really it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>okay. It&rsquo;s okay to go and do drugs. The thing that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>interesting about it is it&rsquo;s really about community, a large</p>
<p>number of people get together, they build camps to do drugs.</p>
<p>No community. No, you&rsquo;ve never been you would. Literally,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not the vibe there. The vibe is really dancing and</p>
<p>creativity and art and community. But anyway, so it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like a rave. It&rsquo;s right here. Everybody&rsquo;s on drugs. I mean,</p>
<p>sure. I mean, with neon with a lot of neon. No, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>might be those experiences are the best when you&rsquo;re sober.</p>
<p>Best best. You have to understand the grace going to</p>
<p>EDC sober. I&rsquo;ve never been to EDC. But this there&rsquo;s a great</p>
<p>filter here, which is, you&rsquo;ve got to drive six, seven hours</p>
<p>into the desert. And you have to survive, you have to bring</p>
<p>everything with you and bring everything out, you know,</p>
<p>whatever it is a bathroom, water, food, and it is harsh. I</p>
<p>mean, it&rsquo;s 100 plus degrees in the day, and it&rsquo;s 40 degrees at</p>
<p>night. It&rsquo;s not easy to survive. It&rsquo;s hard. It used to</p>
<p>be that way. When I went on when I went, I went with a bunch</p>
<p>of guys who had the whole thing like wired in and they had like</p>
<p>these yurts and it was like a whole community and they had</p>
<p>like running water and a kitchen and it was basically</p>
<p>glamping. It was glamping. There are people that hard to</p>
<p>survive. No, there. I mean, it&rsquo;s hard to do that. There are</p>
<p>people who glamp. It is hard to do that because you have to</p>
<p>have to go with people. You have to go with people who know</p>
<p>what they&rsquo;re doing and are highly organized. So yes, they</p>
<p>take months to set that up. So yes, they spent the whole year</p>
<p>whatever setting it up and it was really elaborate. And then</p>
<p>there was an article like in the New York Times basically</p>
<p>saying that, you know, that they were ruining Burning Man.</p>
<p>Yeah, because they were making it too nice.</p>
<p>That was part of the problem. You remember this? That&rsquo;s when I</p>
<p>went, I went to the too nice experience. So they wrote that</p>
<p>about you. Yeah, basically. Great. You ruined Burning Man.</p>
<p>Great. Thanks. Thanks for ruining Burning Man.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ve been following the NFT story. We&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>queue that up as our next story. OpenSea, the marketplace, the</p>
<p>eBay of NFTs, if you will, the volume has dropped 99% since</p>
<p>May 1 peak of $406 million in a single day. On August 28, volume</p>
<p>dropped to around $5 million down 99% according to</p>
<p>decentralized app tracker DAP radar. On a monthly basis,</p>
<p>OpenSea&rsquo;s volume has dropped 90% according to Dune analytics,</p>
<p>the floor price of a board ape has now dropped by 53%. If you</p>
<p>remember, OpenSea raised 300 million at a $13.3 billion</p>
<p>valuation December 2021 in a round led by KOTU and Paradigm.</p>
<p>To put that in perspective, that was nine whole months ago.</p>
<p>My how the world has changed.</p>
<p>February, what&rsquo;s your take on NFTs? And this whole boondoggle?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how to how we look back on it. Yeah, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;ve had a lot of bubbles as a species. This is</p>
<p>just another one.</p>
<p>I thought we&rsquo;re gonna stop doing stock market crashing</p>
<p>stories. Well, this is different. This is a different</p>
<p>market. What do you think? Did you invest in a month of this</p>
<p>story, which is fill in the blank asset class crashed? Yeah.</p>
<p>This one scene, the question I have here, saxes, do you think</p>
<p>that this is the end of the category, though? Do you think</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a category ending? Do you think there was ever</p>
<p>anything interesting here? Because you took you heard a lot</p>
<p>of pitches like I did, for how NFTs we&rsquo;re going to change</p>
<p>everything, not</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll say something, because I liken this to the point. Just to</p>
<p>tie it back to what we just talked about. At the end of the</p>
<p>day. You know, I think I&rsquo;ve said this in the past, but like</p>
<p>what differentiates humans from all other species on Earth is</p>
<p>our ability to tell to communicate and tell stories, a</p>
<p>story is like a narrative about something that doesn&rsquo;t exist.</p>
<p>And by telling that narrative, you can create collective</p>
<p>belief in something. And then that collective belief drives</p>
<p>behavioral change and action in the world, right? I mean,</p>
<p>everything from religion, to government, to money, to art is</p>
<p>all kind of driven, all markets are driven by this notion of</p>
<p>narrative and collective belief that arises from that</p>
<p>narrative. So when you go to an art dealer, and you have a sit</p>
<p>down with an art dealer, you might appreciate the art, but</p>
<p>then the narrative begins. And the narrative is this artist did</p>
<p>this, and they came from this and the artist that looks like</p>
<p>this traded at 6.8 million. And this artist is only trading for</p>
<p>3.2 million. And the whole narrative takes you away into</p>
<p>Okay, I should pay 3.2 million for this piece of art. And</p>
<p>ultimately, it&rsquo;ll be worth more. And that&rsquo;s the fundamental</p>
<p>premise of markets is you&rsquo;re buying into something not</p>
<p>necessarily always, and this is such a minority. Now, it&rsquo;s scary</p>
<p>used to be that you don&rsquo;t a piece of a business, or</p>
<p>productive asset, you pull cash out of it, hopefully, you get</p>
<p>more cash out than you put in when you buy it. Nowadays,</p>
<p>markets allow you to trade. Therefore, the majority of</p>
<p>market based decisions are driven by if I buy something for</p>
<p>x, I&rsquo;m going to be able to sell it to someone else for y. And so</p>
<p>the narrative is driven around, I&rsquo;m paying this, someone else</p>
<p>will pay y down the road, I&rsquo;ll make money from that. And this</p>
<p>has been repeated 1000 times over, it&rsquo;s been repeated in the</p>
<p>ICO tokens, it&rsquo;s been repeated in the tulip bubble, it&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>repeated in every art market and subsidiary of every art</p>
<p>market since the dawn of time, since the dawn of markets. And I</p>
<p>think the NF T&rsquo;s are really just one more kind of example where</p>
<p>this beautiful narrative is formed the digitization of art,</p>
<p>but it is no different than any other form of assets that we</p>
<p>tell ourselves a story around. And we convince ourselves that</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m paying something today, and someone else will pay something</p>
<p>more for me tomorrow. And I will also say that in the last year,</p>
<p>with the liquidity that we saw the last two years, it leached</p>
<p>into the stock market, where there&rsquo;s supposed to be more</p>
<p>rational behavior that ultimately the cash flows of an</p>
<p>asset you&rsquo;re buying should generate more for you than the</p>
<p>money you&rsquo;re spending to buy that that asset. And ultimately,</p>
<p>you can maybe trade out of it early. But still, so much of it</p>
<p>became about well, the stock is going up. Therefore, if I spend</p>
<p>x, someone else will spend y and I&rsquo;ll make money on the stock</p>
<p>with no underlying assertion of what&rsquo;s the productivity of that</p>
<p>business? What&rsquo;s the return on cash going to be based on the</p>
<p>cash flows coming out of that business over time, or any of</p>
<p>the fundamentals around it. And so so much of our discussion</p>
<p>and distortion has really been driven by this narrative</p>
<p>fueling. And I think the NF T&rsquo;s are an example, but there are</p>
<p>many others. And we&rsquo;re going to see many more as long as humans</p>
<p>have the ability to communicate with each other.</p>
<p>Any you have any take on it? Your mouth?</p>
<p>I think freeberg&rsquo;s mostly right. Like, I do think that there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>this thing, the the Burning Man Coachella example, is the best</p>
<p>way to describe this. A lot of these things are the same. But</p>
<p>when a few people approach something early, they&rsquo;re too</p>
<p>insecure to admit that it&rsquo;s the same as something else. And so</p>
<p>they spend a lot of time trying to tell you a narrative about</p>
<p>why it&rsquo;s totally different. The Buffett example, you know, would</p>
<p>be the quote, you know, when somebody tells you that this</p>
<p>time is different, it&rsquo;s probably not that different. Or</p>
<p>the other quote that&rsquo;s well worn in history is like, you</p>
<p>know, things don&rsquo;t necessarily repeat in history, but they</p>
<p>rhyme. All of this is trying to say that other than like</p>
<p>fundamental leaps of science, there&rsquo;s not a lot of stuff</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s new in the world. You know, we are repeating things</p>
<p>over and over. And one of the things we repeat is the social</p>
<p>capital that you get from having certain choices, and then</p>
<p>getting other people to validate those choices, because</p>
<p>you want to feel like you&rsquo;re, you know, worthwhile. And this</p>
<p>happened in NF T&rsquo;s. And I&rsquo;m sure in the first phase of</p>
<p>different movements in art. That also happened. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>probably happened in a bunch of other markets as well. So</p>
<p>these things are more similar than they are different.</p>
<p>Coachella and Burning Man, the same NF T&rsquo;s and part of the art</p>
<p>market, the same, everybody that runs to you with why it&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>different. I would just have a grain of salt and say you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>need to be different. Just enjoy it because you think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>cool. All right, we can go either to this California fast</p>
<p>food wages story. Or we can go to Goldman Sachs workers are</p>
<p>quitting on mass because Goldman Sachs is saying you got</p>
<p>to come back to the office five days a week. Where do you want</p>
<p>to go boys? I think the California thing is really</p>
<p>interesting. Just the three things that California did in</p>
<p>the last week. I don&rsquo;t know if you guys saw but number one is</p>
<p>they basically said that you know, you have they&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>ban ice combustion engines, I think by 2035. So you have to be</p>
<p>battery EV. And they have new sales, you can still have a new</p>
<p>sale. Sorry. Yeah, new sales, which is the first in the</p>
<p>country to do it. And just to go back to a second, California</p>
<p>is the largest auto market in the United States. And</p>
<p>effectively, you know, Trump in California got into a huge spat,</p>
<p>because California had certain emission standards that were</p>
<p>tougher than the rest of the United States. And, you know,</p>
<p>the federal government tried to sue California and back and</p>
<p>forth all of this rigmarole. So California is always sort of led</p>
<p>on climate. That was one thing. Then the second thing is they</p>
<p>said, we&rsquo;re going to create, you know, a state sponsored</p>
<p>organization to set the minimum wage rates for fast food</p>
<p>workers. Pause what we think about that. And then the third</p>
<p>thing is that this Congresswoman, I think, or this</p>
<p>assemblyperson, Buffy Wicks, passed a law through the Senate</p>
<p>and through the house that essentially holds social media</p>
<p>companies liable for the mental well being and the mental health</p>
<p>of kids. And depending on where you&rsquo;re lying on all these</p>
<p>issues, it&rsquo;s like an interesting kind of lens in</p>
<p>which we&rsquo;re like California is really becoming extremely,</p>
<p>extremely legislatively active and basically info imposing</p>
<p>their will on free markets in the economy there.</p>
<p>Yeah. And for people who don&rsquo;t know the fat, the fast food</p>
<p>issue was, they want to move to a more European style where</p>
<p>instead of unions, debating with individual corporations,</p>
<p>McDonald&rsquo;s, Burger King, whoever, what they&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>pay their employees, or employees having that</p>
<p>discussion one on one, they want the state, some state</p>
<p>authority to pick the amount per hour, fast food, companies</p>
<p>pay, and then I guess disintermediate the unions. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>kind of confusing. But interestingly, our friend,</p>
<p>Lorena Gonzalez, if you remember, she&rsquo;s the one who told</p>
<p>Ilan to, you know, f off. And was a former democratic</p>
<p>legislator. She introduced the bill when she was in the</p>
<p>assembly. And so it&rsquo;s kind of a weird approach. I&rsquo;m not sure</p>
<p>why the government</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s not. It&rsquo;s not. It&rsquo;s not disintermediating the unions.</p>
<p>She Lorena Gonzalez, Fletcher, I guess now she&rsquo;s the former</p>
<p>democratic legislature who drove Ilan out of the state. Remember</p>
<p>when she said, you know, f Ilan,</p>
<p>she works message received?</p>
<p>Yes. And he left. Great, great move for for the state. So she</p>
<p>is now running one of the biggest unions. And what she</p>
<p>said is that this bill will move California closer to the labor</p>
<p>model used in Europe, where unions negotiate, the unions are</p>
<p>still negotiating for wages and work conditions, but in an</p>
<p>entire sector with some sort of government board, rather than</p>
<p>company by company. So in other words, it&rsquo;s too slow to</p>
<p>unionize, you know, company by company, they would just want to</p>
<p>unionize entire sectors of the economy. Now, the thing that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>really crazy about this minimum wage proposal is that, like you</p>
<p>said, Jason, it isn&rsquo;t just that they set a minimum wage, they</p>
<p>created a 10 person panel. So there&rsquo;s a new government agency</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going to regulate fast food, the fast food industry,</p>
<p>you know, they&rsquo;re not going to stop a minimum wage, it&rsquo;s gonna</p>
<p>be work conditions. So now you&rsquo;re turning fast food</p>
<p>restaurants into a highly regulated part of the economy.</p>
<p>And the weird thing is, it&rsquo;s not even just all fast food, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>basically chains that have more than 100 fast food restaurants</p>
<p>nationally. So in other words, if you&rsquo;re a local operator of</p>
<p>two McDonald&rsquo;s, you&rsquo;d be subject to this 10 person board. But if</p>
<p>you own 20 restaurants that aren&rsquo;t part of a national chain</p>
<p>in California, then you&rsquo;re not. And so the weird thing is that</p>
<p>some workers in the fast food industry could get this new</p>
<p>minimum wage of $22, where other as other workers who work for,</p>
<p>you know, they&rsquo;re not part of a major chain would get the</p>
<p>statewide minimum wage at 15. So it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s kind of</p>
<p>unfair in that some parts of the restaurant industry are being</p>
<p>regulated and others aren&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Is there any justification here that you can think of to not let</p>
<p>the free market do its thing, Friedberg?</p>
<p>Well, if you represent the workers, you&rsquo;re saying, hey, pay</p>
<p>them $22. And you can. And here&rsquo;s what that points out. It</p>
<p>actually points out that there&rsquo;s probably a pretty big business</p>
<p>flaw in a business that&rsquo;s so reliant on commodity labor. And</p>
<p>that business in and of itself is not as valuable as you might</p>
<p>have thought it was before. Think about it this way. There&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a company called McDonald&rsquo;s. And then there&rsquo;s another company</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s another company called McDonald&rsquo;s labor. And</p>
<p>what happened before is McDonald&rsquo;s employed people to do</p>
<p>work at McDonald&rsquo;s. And maybe what happens in the future is</p>
<p>all those people are looking left and looking right. And</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re like, you know what, McDonald&rsquo;s has nothing without</p>
<p>us. We are the business, we deserve the value. So in terms</p>
<p>of how much of the value of the business flows to the</p>
<p>shareholders of McDonald&rsquo;s, versus the employees that work</p>
<p>at McDonald&rsquo;s, the employees that work at McDonald&rsquo;s are</p>
<p>saying, let&rsquo;s go do a startup. And our startup is called union.</p>
<p>And our business that&rsquo;s called union is now going to provide a</p>
<p>bunch of services to McDonald&rsquo;s. And those services, we&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to start to value capture what they&rsquo;re doing. And it indicates</p>
<p>that maybe there&rsquo;s something inherently disadvantaged in that</p>
<p>model. And it could be that the argument could be made that</p>
<p>that business in the early 20th century, in the late 19th</p>
<p>century, yeah, the 19th century, early 20th century and beyond,</p>
<p>that you could build a good advantaged business, because</p>
<p>there was such an eager hungry workforce, people looking for</p>
<p>work, you people would come and work for nickel an hour or</p>
<p>whatever. And so you as a business owner could make a lot</p>
<p>of money doing that you could sell a product for $1, pay</p>
<p>people 5 cents to make it for you. But nowadays, those people</p>
<p>are looking left, they&rsquo;re looking right. And they&rsquo;re like,</p>
<p>wait a second, we are the business, or we&rsquo;re 90% of the</p>
<p>value of this business. And so a couple things will happen.</p>
<p>Number one is the inherent business model of a company</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s so dependent on commodity service is going to be</p>
<p>flawed and challenged in the 21st century. And fast food</p>
<p>restaurants aren&rsquo;t going to be as valuable businesses that</p>
<p>rely on commodity service are not going to be as valuable.</p>
<p>Number two, businesses are going to automate. So new</p>
<p>businesses will emerge that actually do the fast food work,</p>
<p>or do the car building work, or do the dock loading and</p>
<p>unloading work that are automated, and they&rsquo;ll have an</p>
<p>inherent advantage in the economy, and they&rsquo;ll win. And I</p>
<p>think number three is that in the near term, consumers will</p>
<p>suffer because prices will go up, because someone has to pay</p>
<p>for the incremental cost of running this unionized business.</p>
<p>And that will ultimately be the customer of that business.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll say the fourth point is, I am concerned about this sort of</p>
<p>behavior in regulated spaces, where the government has</p>
<p>actually control over the market itself. So this is a good</p>
<p>example of this is, you know, we had our friend Ryan from</p>
<p>Flexport on a few times, but you can&rsquo;t just start up a</p>
<p>shipping company and have a dock, the docks are run by the</p>
<p>cities, and they&rsquo;re run by the state. And so those docks</p>
<p>access to those docks access to that market is regulated by the</p>
<p>government. So then what happens is the union, right, the labor</p>
<p>company can actually have regulatory capture through the</p>
<p>government of a segment of the economy. And that&rsquo;s where</p>
<p>things start to get dangerous. So look, I&rsquo;m all for unions, if</p>
<p>they want to show that a business is reliant on a</p>
<p>commodity labor force and commodity service, and they all</p>
<p>band together and start a startup. I mean, that&rsquo;s what we</p>
<p>do. We all start a company, yeah, go and compete. But the</p>
<p>issue is then when the government creates regulatory</p>
<p>capture over a segment of the economy, and make it difficult</p>
<p>for the free market to ultimately do its job of either</p>
<p>automating or creating a newly advantaged business model, or</p>
<p>all those things that allow us to progress. automating is</p>
<p>coming. A couple of us made a bet on a crazy idea of like</p>
<p>automated robotic coffee called cafe x. Not to talk our own book</p>
<p>here. And the company really struggled during the pandemic.</p>
<p>But they have two units at SFO. They&rsquo;re doing 70 to $73,000 in</p>
<p>two units last month. And I&rsquo;m like, wow, the company figured</p>
<p>it out. And there&rsquo;s another company doing French fries.</p>
<p>This is the this is the sad thing that California doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>realize is like, I think that the folks writing these laws</p>
<p>have just an extremely poor understanding of economics and</p>
<p>capitalism. Because the first thing that it does, effectively,</p>
<p>and everybody can understand this is, it caps the</p>
<p>profitability of a company, right? Because it effectively</p>
<p>says, if you look at an industry that is over earning,</p>
<p>then this council will essentially see money that</p>
<p>should be reappropriated to employees. Now, that idea is</p>
<p>not necessarily a bad thing. For example, you see that all</p>
<p>the time in technology, right? If you look at the EBITDA</p>
<p>margins of like big tech, and how they&rsquo;ve changed, they&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>actually eroded over time, as the companies have had to</p>
<p>generate more revenue, because employees demand more and more</p>
<p>of those gains. That&rsquo;s an implicit part of how the free</p>
<p>market economy works in technology. So you know, if you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t feel like you&rsquo;re getting paid well at, you know, Google,</p>
<p>you go to meta and you get paid more and vice versa. So there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a natural effect of people being able to do that in certain</p>
<p>markets. But when you impose a margin and essentially say you</p>
<p>can only make 10%, because the rest of these profits I&rsquo;m giving</p>
<p>to these folks, because I&rsquo;ve imputed their new wage to be</p>
<p>something that&rsquo;s much greater than what they were paying</p>
<p>before. The unfortunate thing is what Freebrook said, which is</p>
<p>that you will rebuild that business without those people,</p>
<p>because it is the rational thing to do. And so unfortunately,</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;ll do is you&rsquo;ll take a bunch of people that should be</p>
<p>in the economy, right? Think about like new immigrants or</p>
<p>young people that are first getting on their feet, they&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>take these jobs, you know, I mean, I&rsquo;ve worked for a job.</p>
<p>Yeah, I worked at Burger King when I was 14. That&rsquo;s how I got</p>
<p>first. Yeah. You those jobs won&rsquo;t be there to be had. And</p>
<p>that has ripple effects as these folks get older or try to</p>
<p>get more ingrained in the economy. And this is what I</p>
<p>wish California would understand is that these things</p>
<p>aren&rsquo;t free. And even though they seem like you&rsquo;re coming to</p>
<p>someone&rsquo;s rescue, there&rsquo;s all kinds of unintended</p>
<p>consequences, and very obvious consequences that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>ignoring, by not really understanding how the economy</p>
<p>works. I&rsquo;ll just say, like, look, these people, I can, I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>sorry, sack, but I mean, you know, the people that are</p>
<p>elected, are elected by the people to represent the people,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not elected to govern over the long term plan,</p>
<p>necessarily for the state. And while you think that those two</p>
<p>may be the same, the near term incentive and the near term</p>
<p>motivation of someone who&rsquo;s voting is I want to get a</p>
<p>benefit for myself sooner rather than later, not</p>
<p>necessarily I want to make an investment for 30 or 40 years</p>
<p>down the road. And if you&rsquo;re an individual that&rsquo;s struggling</p>
<p>in some way, you&rsquo;re going to prioritize the former over the</p>
<p>latter. And you&rsquo;re going to elect someone who&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>go put in place public policy that&rsquo;s going to benefit you. So</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t necessarily raise my hand and say I blame the people</p>
<p>that have been elected. I raise my hand and I say, look, this</p>
<p>is the natural evolution of what happens in a democracy</p>
<p>where there is a struggling class. And there were where</p>
<p>there is some sort of view disparity or considered</p>
<p>disparity, that this is what&rsquo;s going to happen in a</p>
<p>democracy under this condition is that you&rsquo;re going to elect</p>
<p>individuals who are going to go and govern and they&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>make decisions that are going to benefit those individuals that</p>
<p>got them elected over the short term. And there may be some real</p>
<p>long term damage that results.</p>
<p>sax is a part of this problem is that people are now looking</p>
<p>to the government to solve their problems in life versus</p>
<p>maybe looking internally to solve their problems and, you</p>
<p>know, negotiate better salaries and no, but hold on, I think you</p>
<p>have to give people a little bit more credit. Nobody was asking</p>
<p>for them to step in like this.</p>
<p>Look, this is as much for the politicians as it is for any of</p>
<p>the workers. What&rsquo;s happening right now, the National</p>
<p>Restaurant Association and all these restaurant lobbying</p>
<p>groups are flooding the state, the legislators, the governor</p>
<p>with lobbying money, because they want to get this bill</p>
<p>modified, tempered or thrown out. And so this is basically a</p>
<p>racket. Like, look, as a public policy matter, it makes zero</p>
<p>sense for the same worker if they go work at, say, Jiffy</p>
<p>Lube, or something outside the restaurant industry, they get</p>
<p>the California minimum wage of $15. If they go to a mom and pop</p>
<p>restaurant, they get the minimum wage of $15. But if they go to</p>
<p>McDonald&rsquo;s, they now get a new minimum wage, specifically for</p>
<p>chain restaurants of $22. That simply makes no sense. There&rsquo;s</p>
<p>no public policy rationale. But the real question you have to</p>
<p>ask and Toronto is kind of getting at this is why shouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>it be $50? Why shouldn&rsquo;t it be $100? Well, the reason is</p>
<p>because if you raise the minimum wage too much, then these</p>
<p>employers have a huge incentive to replace that labor with</p>
<p>automation. And so the unintended consequence of</p>
<p>Chamath is talking about is that these big chain restaurants</p>
<p>are going to rely even more heavily on automation now, and</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going to basically employ less of this labor, where</p>
<p>the price has been artificially raised for that subsector of</p>
<p>the economy for $15 to $22, for reasons that no one can really</p>
<p>explain. So again, this is not for the benefit of workers, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>for the benefit of the politicians. Look what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>happening right now, is all these articles talking about the</p>
<p>lobbyists coming in, they&rsquo;re going to have Gavin Newsom</p>
<p>begging him to be their savior right now. And this is the game</p>
<p>that the California Democratic Party plays. It&rsquo;s a one party</p>
<p>state where they were basically business loves Gavin Newsom,</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s their protector. He&rsquo;s the protection end of the</p>
<p>extortion racket. Lorena Gonzalez gets this bill passed,</p>
<p>which is basically incredibly damaging to these chain</p>
<p>restaurants, and they have to go running to Gavin Newsom and</p>
<p>beg him to either veto it or modify it temper the bill. So</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not as destructive to their business. He&rsquo;s a protection in</p>
<p>the extortion racket, but it&rsquo;s the same racket. This is a one</p>
<p>party state. And what they&rsquo;re doing with chain restaurants,</p>
<p>they would do with every sector of the economy, if they could,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just a matter of time.</p>
<p>And what is the purpose of the California government? Like, are</p>
<p>there things they could be focusing on other than this,</p>
<p>like maybe the free market settles this issue, and they</p>
<p>could extract benefits from the private sector from basically</p>
<p>the wealth producing part of the economy, and to line their</p>
<p>pockets in the pockets of their supporters, you know that the</p>
<p>typical government worker in California makes 53% more than</p>
<p>their private sector counterpart. And if you factor</p>
<p>in all the pensions that have been promised, it&rsquo;s 100% more.</p>
<p>Okay, so basically, there&rsquo;s a huge wealth transfer that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>taking place, where the we&rsquo;re basically the legislatures, the</p>
<p>party, they are transferring wealth from the private sector</p>
<p>to their supporters, their backers. And freeware, you talk</p>
<p>about democracy, listen, I mean, California is a one party state</p>
<p>and ballot harvesting is legal here. I&rsquo;m not saying the votes</p>
<p>are fake or anything like that. But there&rsquo;s a giant party</p>
<p>machinery and apparatus that literally just goes door to door</p>
<p>and collects the ballots from their supporters. They literally</p>
<p>know who their supporters are on a door by door household by</p>
<p>household level. It has gotten to the point now where the party</p>
<p>machine is so powerful, they can pretty much run anybody for</p>
<p>any post and get them elected. It&rsquo;s very hard for an outsider</p>
<p>candidate.</p>
<p>It does feel like I&rsquo;m getting tired of it here.</p>
<p>No, but guys, that&rsquo;s exactly how it works. I mean, like, if you</p>
<p>look at Gavin Newsom&rsquo;s run to the governorship, he paid his</p>
<p>dues, he did the right jobs, he waited in line, he didn&rsquo;t, you</p>
<p>know, rock the boat, independent of any of the things he did</p>
<p>right or wrong. And he had some pretty big moral transgressions.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t matter, because it is about paying your dues and</p>
<p>waiting in line, because there aren&rsquo;t any meaningful challenges</p>
<p>here. None.</p>
<p>In LA right now, there&rsquo;s a mayoral race going on. And the</p>
<p>two, there&rsquo;s a runoff between Rick Crusoe and Karen Bass.</p>
<p>Karen Bass is basically a product of the political machine.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s basically worked her way up in the Democratic Party</p>
<p>forever, sort of uninspiring candidate. She&rsquo;s just basically</p>
<p>a puppet of the machine. Caruso is actually he&rsquo;s a real estate</p>
<p>developer who&rsquo;s built some of the most landmark, you know,</p>
<p>spots in LA like the Grove, like the Pacific Palisades</p>
<p>development. He&rsquo;s made incredible. He&rsquo;s created</p>
<p>incredible amenities for the LA area. He&rsquo;s also been on a bunch</p>
<p>of civic boards. You know, I had lunch with him at the Grove and</p>
<p>people are coming up to him. He&rsquo;s like a celebrity. They&rsquo;re</p>
<p>taking photos with him. He&rsquo;s the best possible candidate that</p>
<p>you could have in a place like LA. He actually understands</p>
<p>business. I think he would restore law and order. I mean,</p>
<p>all this kind of stuff, right? He&rsquo;s spoken out about the</p>
<p>homeless problem being out of control. And on election night,</p>
<p>he had the most votes. But five days later, when they counted</p>
<p>all the, the basically the collected ballots through ballot</p>
<p>harvesting, Karen Bass was up by like five points. That is the</p>
<p>power of the ballot harvesting. And I still hope that he wins,</p>
<p>but the party machine is so powerful, they can basically get</p>
<p>almost anyone elected in the state.</p>
<p>Get the ballot.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know. I don&rsquo;t really know what it&rsquo;s gonna take to</p>
<p>change it. What&rsquo;s that?</p>
<p>Just devil&rsquo;s advocate here. The ballot harvesting can work both</p>
<p>ways. Like you could go collect Republican votes.</p>
<p>No, but you have to have the party infrastructure to</p>
<p>literally go door to door.</p>
<p>The Republican hasn&rsquo;t, the Republicans haven&rsquo;t built that</p>
<p>in this state.</p>
<p>Think about it this way. Okay. So, you know, like your phone,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a platform and there&rsquo;s an app. Think about the party as</p>
<p>the platform and the candidate as the app. Okay. The platform</p>
<p>can drive a ton of traffic to whatever app they want. A guy</p>
<p>like Caruso doesn&rsquo;t have the party behind him. So he has to</p>
<p>build his own operating system.</p>
<p>He can use the media, right?</p>
<p>Exactly. So he has to build his own platform. Then he has to</p>
<p>build his own candidacy. So when you think about the amount of</p>
<p>money that&rsquo;s required to do something like that, about how</p>
<p>hard it is to do it, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s very, very hard. So he spent</p>
<p>something like a hundred million dollars of his own money.</p>
<p>Hopefully he wins, but if he doesn&rsquo;t, all the infrastructure,</p>
<p>all the platform that he created just goes away. And then the</p>
<p>next candidate has to start from scratch. This is why</p>
<p>outsiders, why isn&rsquo;t the GOP invested in California? They</p>
<p>just don&rsquo;t think they have any shot because it seems like the</p>
<p>Democrats are investing heavily in trying to flip, you know,</p>
<p>look, there&rsquo;s a two to one affiliation. There&rsquo;s a two to</p>
<p>one party affiliation in California towards Democrats. So</p>
<p>look, I mean, the Republican Party here is a mess. And that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>part of the problem is the Republican Party in California</p>
<p>needs to move to the center. It&rsquo;s a plus 30 blue state,</p>
<p>unless they&rsquo;re willing to do that, they&rsquo;re not going to make</p>
<p>progress. But that could take, you know, generations to fix.</p>
<p>And with Roe v. Wade, and that kind of stuff, it&rsquo;s going to be</p>
<p>really hard to look, there are pro choice Republicans in</p>
<p>California. But all Newsom has to do is point to what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>happening in Texas. And, you know, all of a sudden, people</p>
<p>kind of revert to their tribal political affiliations.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll make I&rsquo;ll make one more simple point. The average voter</p>
<p>in California probably knows more people that work at</p>
<p>McDonald&rsquo;s than our shareholders of McDonald&rsquo;s. And I</p>
<p>think in any time that there&rsquo;s policy that gets voted or gets</p>
<p>suggested, or ultimately gets passed, there&rsquo;s a side that</p>
<p>benefits and there&rsquo;s a side that doesn&rsquo;t. And if you know</p>
<p>more people that benefit on one side than are hurt, you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>probably going to be supportive of that policy. And I think</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s probably a pretty simple rubric for thinking about how</p>
<p>these things over time evolve.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s true nationally. Why is that only</p>
<p>true for California? I mean, like in Florida, the average</p>
<p>person in Florida knows more people who work at McDonald&rsquo;s</p>
<p>and shareholders McDonald&rsquo;s, and they&rsquo;re not engaged in a</p>
<p>systematic takeover of the private sector.</p>
<p>philosophically, they&rsquo;re, they believe in independence and</p>
<p>businesses not being interfered by the government, right? That&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a core tenant of the Republican Party.</p>
<p>Also, the sad reality is that within a few years,</p>
<p>unfortunately, you&rsquo;ll know a lot fewer people that work at</p>
<p>McDonald&rsquo;s because the number of jobs for humans will be</p>
<p>dramatically lower.</p>
<p>They got rid of the cashiers that&rsquo;s gone already, or what</p>
<p>people will be more acutely aware of in a number of years</p>
<p>is how expensive McDonald&rsquo;s has gotten. Because if the price</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know that that won&rsquo;t be because like, again, McDonald&rsquo;s</p>
<p>has a very simple. No, not not even the market. McDonald&rsquo;s is</p>
<p>not stupid. They understand how to use Excel. And so they&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>think, well, I can advertise a robot versus actually jacking</p>
<p>up prices, because what McDonald&rsquo;s understands is the</p>
<p>sensitivity of pricing to demand for their product. Yeah,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s right. I mean, they are the most intelligent about how</p>
<p>they price every anything at the sort of the lower end where</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re capturing, you know, nickels and dimes, they are the</p>
<p>most sophisticated and understanding supply demand, and</p>
<p>and the curves. And so to think that they&rsquo;re not going to just</p>
<p>invest heavily now at the corporate level, the next</p>
<p>franchisee of McDonald&rsquo;s will still pay $1 million for</p>
<p>franchise fee, but will give will be given a bevy of robots</p>
<p>that they run for McDonald&rsquo;s, and they&rsquo;ll have to hire half or</p>
<p>a third less. That&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s the real shame of this, which</p>
<p>is the number of people that should actually be gainfully</p>
<p>employed in the economy will then shrink again. But in this</p>
<p>case, it was because legislators just completely don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>understand how incentives work and how the economy works. And</p>
<p>people are not clued into exactly how well narrow AI</p>
<p>machine learning is doing right now. I&rsquo;ll say like, it&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>moving quickly. One general way to think about this is</p>
<p>technology is introduced, and the technology creator captures</p>
<p>roughly a third to a half of the value increment, because of the</p>
<p>delivery of that technology, the productivity increment. So let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>say that it costs 12 $15 an hour to employ a McDonald&rsquo;s labor</p>
<p>today. And let&rsquo;s say that you can build technology that the</p>
<p>amortized robotic cost is $10 an hour, there will be a</p>
<p>technology company that will make 250 an hour off of that. So</p>
<p>net net, what ends up happening is productivity has to be gained.</p>
<p>And prices will reduce. And so you know, there are moments like</p>
<p>this where there could be an acceleration of technology, and</p>
<p>also an opportunity for new industries to emerge. And when</p>
<p>that happens, new jobs emerge, too. So it&rsquo;s, you know, maybe</p>
<p>look, I mean, at the end of the day, it seems Luddite ish. But</p>
<p>you know, there&rsquo;s going to be a market market opportunity that</p>
<p>will arise.</p>
<p>I think we need to like, just step back and, and ask what is</p>
<p>the type of economy that California is creating here with</p>
<p>this fast food law with these other laws we&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>This is a state in which you have a disappearing middle class,</p>
<p>the middle class has been moving out of the state by the</p>
<p>hundreds of 1000s. In fact, last year, we had for the first</p>
<p>time net migration out of the state. This is basically become</p>
<p>a state where the only middle class are basically the</p>
<p>government workers who like we talked about, are making twice</p>
<p>as much as their private sector counterparts. It&rsquo;s a state where</p>
<p>you have the very rich and very poor, and the only middle class</p>
<p>are government workers. That is what we&rsquo;re creating, the rich</p>
<p>in the state have done really well over the last few decades.</p>
<p>Why? Because of globalization. So you take the two big</p>
<p>industries in the state tech, and Hollywood entertainment,</p>
<p>they have benefited enormously through globalization, because</p>
<p>now you can sell software, or you can sell movies or music.</p>
<p>Exactly. So now these these industries have become, you</p>
<p>know, massive global exports. And so if you&rsquo;re in those</p>
<p>industries in California, you&rsquo;ve done really well, because now</p>
<p>your market is the whole world. So the super rich have done</p>
<p>really well, that&rsquo;s funded the state that&rsquo;s allowed the state</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost like a resource curse, to have all of these bad</p>
<p>policies that really hurt small business owners, they&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>moving out of the state. And so again, you&rsquo;ve got the very rich</p>
<p>and very poor. This is not an economic model for the entire</p>
<p>nation. This is what you know, Gavin Newsom says he wants to</p>
<p>take to all of America, this is not a model for all of America.</p>
<p>In order for democracy to function, we need a thriving</p>
<p>middle class. And this is not a recipe for delivering a thriving</p>
<p>middle class to America. And that I just want to show you</p>
<p>guys a quick video, which play for five seconds here. We had</p>
<p>invested in this company that got sold, I&rsquo;m not gonna even say</p>
<p>the name of it. But if you watch this quick robot, this is a</p>
<p>computer vision company out of Boston. And like, they&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>high speed picking of tomatoes and berries. Like this is a two</p>
<p>year old video when we invested and wound up getting bought by</p>
<p>another company, and they&rsquo;re doing vertical farming. But and</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s companies doing this now for franchise, it&rsquo;s over, like</p>
<p>we are within, you know, I think 510 years of a lot of these</p>
<p>jobs, we&rsquo;re talking 10s of millions of manual labor jobs</p>
<p>being gone. And and we&rsquo;re going to look at this moment in time,</p>
<p>where we tried to squeeze an extra 10 or 20% out of these,</p>
<p>you know, employers, and then you&rsquo;re going to see these</p>
<p>employers say, you know what, 24 hour a day robot? Yeah, it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>little bit upfront cost, I&rsquo;ll put it on a lease, and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>just going to move to these robots. It&rsquo;s really very close to</p>
<p>being game over for manual labor. And you can see it also</p>
<p>with Cybertruck. And you know, what Elon&rsquo;s doing with AI, and</p>
<p>these things are getting so close. And it&rsquo;s been, I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know, when did you invest in your first robotics or AI</p>
<p>company, Saks or Chamath? Do you remember the first robotic or AI</p>
<p>company you invested in? And how long ago was</p>
<ol start="2014">
<li>It&rsquo;s a company called relativity space, which is 3d</li>
</ol>
<p>printing rockets and engines. And basically, they&rsquo;re able to</p>
<p>use machines to learn how to actually fix the morphology of</p>
<p>all the materials that they use to print better and cheaper and</p>
<p>more useful rocketry. That&rsquo;s an example. But then that led me</p>
<p>down the garden path, I was just going to say something more</p>
<p>generic, instead of talking our book, which is, I think people</p>
<p>misunderstand that Moore&rsquo;s law has actually not ended. And this</p>
<p>is something that a friend of mine, Adam D&rsquo;Angelo,</p>
<p>characterized to me, beautiful human being from work together.</p>
<p>He was a CTO of Facebook when I worked there. So we this is, you</p>
<p>know, we&rsquo;ve known each other for 1516 years. And now he&rsquo;s a CEO</p>
<p>and founder of Quora. But you know, the way that he described</p>
<p>it to me, which is so true, the minute he said it, I was like,</p>
<p>my gosh, it&rsquo;s like Moore&rsquo;s law never ended, it just shifted to</p>
<p>GPUs, you know, because the inherent lack of parallelization</p>
<p>that CPUs have, you solve the GPUs. And so that&rsquo;s why the</p>
<p>the surface area of compute of innovation has actually shifted</p>
<p>Jason to what you&rsquo;re saying, which is, you know, all of these</p>
<p>new kinds of machine learned models, because you can just now</p>
<p>brute force and create such a tonnage of compute capabilities</p>
<p>and resources to solve these problems that weren&rsquo;t possible</p>
<p>before. So, you know, you see this thing, you know, fun things</p>
<p>like Wally, or, you know, Dali, sorry, and more sophisticated</p>
<p>things like GPT three. But he&rsquo;s right, which is that, you know,</p>
<p>we are at a point now where all kinds of expert systems, which</p>
<p>is sort of like v1, simple forms of AI are going to be completely</p>
<p>next level. Well, you think about the data sets adding to</p>
<p>that. And so when government exactly. And so when governments</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t understand this, and they try to hit, you know, step in,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going to be shocked at how much faster they&rsquo;re pulling</p>
<p>forward the actual future they actually are trying to prevent.</p>
<p>Yeah, the the data sets is the other issue, Friedberg, you look</p>
<p>at, you know, the the data sets that are available to train. So</p>
<p>you have the GPUs still escalating massively, the amount</p>
<p>of compute power can do you have cloud computing at the same</p>
<p>time, and then you have these data sets. One of the most</p>
<p>interesting things about, you know, Dolly, and a lot of these</p>
<p>is the corpus of data they&rsquo;re able to absorb. And a second</p>
<p>factor issue that is starting to come up is who owns the</p>
<p>derivative work in copyright. So if you train your data set on</p>
<p>a bunch of images, and those images are owned by Disney, or</p>
<p>whoever, you know, photographer Getty, and then the AI makes you</p>
<p>a new photo. So here&rsquo;s another example of this. Here&rsquo;s another</p>
<p>example of this in a law that just passed. So in the IRA, the</p>
<p>Inflation Reduction Act, you know, we granted CMS and Medicare</p>
<p>the ability to negotiate drug prices. And we actually also</p>
<p>capped the total prescription costs that any American can pay</p>
<p>at $2,000. Now, it turns out that overwhelmingly, most</p>
<p>Americans will never spend $2,000 a year on prescription</p>
<p>medications, but there will be a few and they bump up against</p>
<p>drugs that cost millions of dollars. So there was a, you</p>
<p>know, there&rsquo;s a drug for, you know, SMA. That&rsquo;s like, you</p>
<p>know, 2.4 million and like, you know, beta thalassemia, like</p>
<p>2.8 million. And you&rsquo;re and and we will all bear the cost of</p>
<p>that. Now, if CMS and Medicare, go and really crunch those</p>
<p>costs, what is pharma going to do? Well, pharma is going to do</p>
<p>what is the obvious thing, which is like, if you&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>cap what I can make, I have to completely change my R&amp;D model.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re just going to use alpha fold, you know, and what</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really going to do is potentially put a bunch of</p>
<p>research scientists, how to work. And those are folks that</p>
<p>should probably in the, you know, for our general future be</p>
<p>gainfully employed. But the nature of their job is going to</p>
<p>change completely because the economic capitalist incentive</p>
<p>of big pharma is going to move towards technology, which is,</p>
<p>you know, an alpha fold, and their protein library is the</p>
<p>equivalent of AI and automation for McDonald&rsquo;s. So this is</p>
<p>where, again, governments have to be super careful that they</p>
<p>understand what&rsquo;s actually happening, because they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>creating incentives, I think that they don&rsquo;t completely</p>
<p>understand.</p>
<p>All right, we can go to raw meat for sacks, Zuckerberg&rsquo;s</p>
<p>admission of FBI meddling, truth social.</p>
<p>After you guys disputed me and like, how dare you imply that</p>
<p>J. Edgar Hoover and Jim Comey&rsquo;s FBI is politicized. Remember,</p>
<p>you guys were debating and</p>
<p>that was about the investigation.</p>
<p>You didn&rsquo;t, but some of you were saying, I can&rsquo;t believe</p>
<p>sacks that you&rsquo;re part of the 35% of Americans who don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>believe fully in the rectitude and integrity of the FBI.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if this is</p>
<p>comes this bombshell. I mean, you gotta admit this was a</p>
<p>bombshell.</p>
<p>What was a bombshell? Okay, so I&rsquo;ll get up here. Okay, so Joe,</p>
<p>Joe Rogan had Zuck on. And he asked him about this very</p>
<p>specific thing. Remember the New York Post story on Hunter</p>
<p>Biden&rsquo;s laptop in like the week or two before the election was</p>
<p>censored, right? And there&rsquo;s a very controversial thing,</p>
<p>because the FBI was dealing with known Russian interference</p>
<p>and hacks and all this stuff. Part of which Trump was like</p>
<p>asking people to hack other candidates.</p>
<p>Okay, you&rsquo;re not even setting this up correctly.</p>
<p>Well, okay, I&rsquo;m gonna keep going. And then so this is what</p>
<p>Zuckerberg said, Hey, look,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s moderate this segment.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, I&rsquo;m just gonna read the Federalist, which is,</p>
<p>you know, super right wing, but he says, I&rsquo;ll just read you</p>
<p>what Zuck said, because that&rsquo;s says it all. He says, Hey, look,</p>
<p>if the FBI, which I still view as a legitimate institution in</p>
<p>this country, I&rsquo;m quoting from the Federalist, which is</p>
<p>quoting him from Joe Rogan. It&rsquo;s a very professional law</p>
<p>enforcement, they come to us and tell us we need to be on</p>
<p>guard about something I want to take it seriously. So when the</p>
<p>New York Post broke the Hunter Biden laptop story on October</p>
<p>14 2020, Facebook treated the story as potentially</p>
<p>misinformation, important misinformation for five to seven</p>
<p>days while the tech giants team could determine whether it was</p>
<p>false or not. During that time, this is federal speaking,</p>
<p>decreased its distribution, Facebook decreased distribution</p>
<p>of the story by making the story rank lower in the news feed.</p>
<p>And this is his quote, Zuckerberg, you could still</p>
<p>share it, you could still consume it, Zuckerberg explained,</p>
<p>but quote, fewer people saw it than would have otherwise.</p>
<p>And while he would not quantify the impact, the Facebook</p>
<p>founder said the decreased distribution was quote, unquote,</p>
<p>meaningful. And a follow up Rogan asked if the FBI had</p>
<p>specifically said, quote, to be on guard about that story,</p>
<p>meaning the laptop story, after originally responding, no,</p>
<p>Zuckerberg corrective says, I don&rsquo;t remember if it was that</p>
<p>specifically, but it was basically the pattern. So</p>
<p>basically, I guess you would agree, sacks, Zack didn&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>exactly what to do here with this information. And if it was</p>
<p>real or not, which, you know, it turned out to be very real,</p>
<p>and it probably could have swayed the election. I mean, I</p>
<p>do think if people thought there was a connection between</p>
<p>Hunter Biden, maybe it could have, I don&rsquo;t know if we want</p>
<p>people being hacked to do that. So what&rsquo;s your take on it?</p>
<p>sexy, you know, just hacking in general, and the specific</p>
<p>thing, what should the FBI do? If these kind of hacks are</p>
<p>getting released of people&rsquo;s families? Okay, so yeah, here&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a complicated issue, right? There&rsquo;s many vectors. Yeah.</p>
<p>What Zack basically says the FBI came to them and encourage</p>
<p>them to suppress the story or to suppress a story that they</p>
<p>described, that would be just like this. Okay. So now look, a</p>
<p>lot of conservators are dragging Zuckerberg and Facebook</p>
<p>for doing for doing the FBI&rsquo;s bidding. But I think a lot of</p>
<p>people, I think most people in Zuckerberg&rsquo;s position, would</p>
<p>have believed the FBI when the FBI comes to you and says,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re about to be targeted by Russians information, you need</p>
<p>to do something about it, you would have listened to the FBI,</p>
<p>he believed the FBI, my point, and so I don&rsquo;t blame Facebook</p>
<p>too much for that. I think it&rsquo;s understandable that he would</p>
<p>have believed them. The issue here is the politicization of</p>
<p>the FBI. Look, let&rsquo;s back up what was happening. So the New</p>
<p>York Post gets this story about the leak contents of other</p>
<p>Biden&rsquo;s hard drive. In response to that, you had 50 former</p>
<p>security state officials, many of whom were democratic</p>
<p>partisans, like Clapper, like Brennan, they signed a letter</p>
<p>saying that this story has all the hallmarks of Russian</p>
<p>disinformation. Now, the truth is, they had not inspected the</p>
<p>hard drive. They simply said, this is the hallmarks of it. And</p>
<p>as a result of that, we thought that the social networks and so</p>
<p>forth censored the story. Okay. Now it turns out that the FBI,</p>
<p>by the way, the FBI had the hard drive, that the hard drive for</p>
<p>over a year, it was an image of the hard drive with the actual</p>
<p>hard drive, they had the actual hard drive, the leak of the</p>
<p>story was, was likely prompted because the FBI didn&rsquo;t appear to</p>
<p>be doing anything with the hard drive. So somebody leaked the</p>
<p>story to, you know, to Rudy Giuliani, and then he leaked it</p>
<p>and so forth to the New York Post. But the point is that the</p>
<p>FBI had the hard drive. So they knew it was authentic. Okay, so</p>
<p>they knew that this hallmarks of Russian disinformation was not</p>
<p>the truth. Because again, they had the authenticated hard drive</p>
<p>in their possession. And yet they still went to Zuckerberg</p>
<p>and basically played into this narrative, this phony narrative</p>
<p>that, you know, democratic partisans like clapper and like</p>
<p>Brennan had created.</p>
<p>Was there anything meaningful, by the way, about what was on the</p>
<p>laptop in your mind? Like, do you think it&rsquo;s relevant? Or do</p>
<p>you think we want people&rsquo;s laptops being hacked like this</p>
<p>were in people&rsquo;s political families?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think the laptop was hacked. I mean, there&rsquo;s a weird</p>
<p>convoluted story about laptop ended up but but look, the</p>
<p>point is that personal pictures, you know, and stuff like that be</p>
<p>never liked the part where they were showing 100 biden&rsquo;s, you</p>
<p>know, drug use and the other personal stuff. I thought that</p>
<p>was scurrilous. And I didn&rsquo;t I didn&rsquo;t like it. And I didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think that was particularly germane. So I think and I think</p>
<p>it was an invasion of his privacy. However, there were</p>
<p>materials on there related to his business dealings in</p>
<p>Ukraine. And I don&rsquo;t say see how you can say those weren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>relevant. Oh, I think it&rsquo;s being investigated for them to now. I</p>
<p>mean, a lot of this has to do with timing to you know, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like, how do you deal with something like this seven days</p>
<p>before an election when you know the Russians are hacking it, if</p>
<p>it has been or not, it&rsquo;s a really difficult situation for</p>
<p>everybody. So look, my point, my point is this that I can agree</p>
<p>with you about the personal stuff about 100 biden shouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have come out but but with respect to the Ukraine stuff</p>
<p>that was legitimate, it was fair game. And the most</p>
<p>importantly, I don&rsquo;t know whether it would have swung the</p>
<p>election or not, probably not probably by itself. It&rsquo;s not but</p>
<p>the real point here is that the FBI went to Facebook to</p>
<p>censor a story that they must have known was true because they</p>
<p>had the laptop in their possession. They should not be</p>
<p>intervening in elections that way. That is the bombshell here.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s unbelievable. I think they didn&rsquo;t know the providence</p>
<p>of this, but I guess we&rsquo;ll find out where you land in the</p>
<p>providence of a hard drive that&rsquo;s in their possession.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t have an NFT. Exactly. How are you? I think the</p>
<p>audience circle tomorrow. Exactly. Yes, exactly. No, but</p>
<p>sex audience really wants to know where you were going to</p>
<p>reserve judgment on the Mar-a-Lago search. Where do you</p>
<p>and or republicans come out on all this now when you see</p>
<p>lucky he did in fact have a ton of really sensitive stuff,</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s not a ton of defined ton of really sensitive stuff.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, he wouldn&rsquo;t give it back like what&rsquo;s your what</p>
<p>is your pages of documents mark classified? If you were to go</p>
<p>to the 30,000 boxes of documents that Obama took, are you telling</p>
<p>me you really couldn&rsquo;t find 300 pages that have classified</p>
<p>markings on them? Well, the fact that he wouldn&rsquo;t give it</p>
<p>back. By the way, I never disputed. Hold on a second. I</p>
<p>never disputed that they would find documents with classified</p>
<p>markings in Trump&rsquo;s basement. I still think that the approach</p>
<p>was heavy handed. And we don&rsquo;t know enough because we don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know what those documents are. Every document they stick in</p>
<p>front of the president or not every but many of them are more</p>
<p>classified. Let me ask you this, aside from these like kind of</p>
<p>details. What is what is Trump&rsquo;s deal that he just wouldn&rsquo;t give</p>
<p>them back? Do you think what do you think his motivation was? I</p>
<p>mean, I have my own theory, which he likes memorabilia. He&rsquo;s</p>
<p>always like to show off. I think that&rsquo;s it. I think you got it. I</p>
<p>mean, honestly, if I had to guess what this whole thing was</p>
<p>about, it&rsquo;s probably that the archivist at the National</p>
<p>Archives, once the original copy of those letters with little</p>
<p>rocket man, and he doesn&rsquo;t want to give them up. Right? I</p>
<p>literally think that&rsquo;s what this is about. I think it&rsquo;s about</p>
<p>something as silly as memorable memorabilia. It&rsquo;s about</p>
<p>memorabilia. I do not think these documents pose a threat.</p>
<p>When Trump just give it all back. So dumb. But why would the</p>
<p>FBI feel the need to do a raid?</p>
<p>Because</p>
<p>by the way, remember, remember when we first discussed this</p>
<p>post, like when we first discussed this issue, we were</p>
<p>told it was nuclear. It was nuclear secrets.</p>
<p>Could be. Yeah.</p>
<p>No, they&rsquo;ve backed off that completely. It was not in the</p>
<p>affidavit. It&rsquo;s not about nuclear. That was something they</p>
<p>leaked to get them through a tough press cycle. So but look,</p>
<p>my point about all this stuff, just to wrap it up, so people</p>
<p>are clear was never to defend Trump, per se. My real concern</p>
<p>is the politicization of the FBI. Our law enforcement agency</p>
<p>should not be weaponized by either party to pursue their</p>
<p>but you believe they are at this point. And we just saw with</p>
<p>the Zuckerberg thing, what business did the FBI have going</p>
<p>to Zuckerberg to get them to censor a New York Post story</p>
<p>that turned out to be completely true? Hold on a</p>
<p>second. That is election interference. They should not be</p>
<p>doing that. Yeah, that is a tough job. If they don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s been stolen or not. Yeah, it&rsquo;s a tough job. By the</p>
<p>way, the government of the United States has no business</p>
<p>censoring a free press. That is a violation of the First</p>
<p>Amendment. When the government instructs a private company to</p>
<p>censor a press story that the government itself does not have</p>
<p>the authority to censor. That is a violation of the First</p>
<p>Amendment. We thought remember when Jack Dorsey said that he</p>
<p>regretted the censorship that Twitter did. And he came out</p>
<p>with that apology. We thought it was just Twitter&rsquo;s decision.</p>
<p>Now we find out from Zuck that he was leaned on by the FBI. And</p>
<p>I think that these big tech companies like Twitter, like</p>
<p>Facebook, they&rsquo;re going to have to have a new policy, which is</p>
<p>when the government says we want you to censor something,</p>
<p>their response needs to be show us a court order. They&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>just sensor now based on the say so of some operative. I</p>
<p>would agree with you. I agree with you on that. I think it was</p>
<p>a bad decision. Obviously. The one big tech company that</p>
<p>really nailed this, I think was Apple, you know, very early on,</p>
<p>they drew a really hard line in the sand with the San Bernardino</p>
<p>shooter, because they said, if we allow the FBI to get into</p>
<p>this person&rsquo;s phone, even though, you know, what he did</p>
<p>was completely heinous, we are going to create a backdoor that</p>
<p>will become an exploit for everybody. And we are drawing</p>
<p>the line on privacy and security. Now, different set of</p>
<p>issues, but it just goes to show you, there have been a few</p>
<p>examples where some of these companies have drawn a hard</p>
<p>line. And then in that example, and I think Jason, you</p>
<p>mentioned this, they went to Israel and have that company</p>
<p>hack the phone, whatever, but it didn&rsquo;t come with, they were</p>
<p>able to stand up to the pressure. So I think there are</p>
<p>some example sets where you can say no. I mean, that the idea</p>
<p>that Twitter would block a New York Post URL, it&rsquo;s like, ah,</p>
<p>such a jump ball. Like, if it was the sex material, I could</p>
<p>understand them saying like, you can&rsquo;t hack it. That&rsquo;s</p>
<p>against our terms of service for and we agree on that sex. But</p>
<p>in this case, like, I don&rsquo;t know, let&rsquo;s go to something</p>
<p>more interesting. Well, heat wave, I think in the drowning,</p>
<p>I know this is interesting to sacks, but I think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>interesting to everybody else in the audience. Heat waves and</p>
<p>droughts are just use flashes hot in summer. Yeah, I think</p>
<p>this might have to do with global warming and be a little</p>
<p>unique. I&rsquo;m kidding. I&rsquo;m kidding. I know there&rsquo;s more</p>
<p>to it for all the SGP people get into sacks and say, you</p>
<p>know, your globe, you believe in global warming.</p>
<p>By the way, I do think the death of Gorbachev is a big</p>
<p>story. Okay.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s give free Burke his science corner. And then we&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>come back around. I give you your raw meat.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your what&rsquo;s your point of view on climate change, the</p>
<p>impact it will have on the planet? And whether like urgent</p>
<p>action is needed?</p>
<p>Listen, I&rsquo;m not an expert in that area. I&rsquo;m not going to</p>
<p>pretend to be I do think that that we can&rsquo;t save the planet</p>
<p>by destroying the economy. And it seems to me that too many of</p>
<p>the save the planet people like want to take reckless extreme</p>
<p>actions that would wreck our economy. You just saw actually</p>
<p>Ilan just gave a talk this and made news this past week from</p>
<p>Norway, where he said that we still need oil and gas. He&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>leading innovator in basically moving.</p>
<p>And he said, Listen, unfortunately, we got to rely on</p>
<p>oil and gas because it&rsquo;s too important for civilization. If</p>
<p>we cut this stuff off too quickly, we end civilization.</p>
<p>I think this is a long term problem. But and I think we need</p>
<p>to have long term solutions. Global warming, just full stop.</p>
<p>The planet is warming. You agree with it? It&rsquo;s not just</p>
<p>about warming, just just just to use a different term, that</p>
<p>there are more frequent extreme events that can severely hurt</p>
<p>people hurt the economy hurt the food supply hurt the energy</p>
<p>supply, all the things that, you know, I think we&rsquo;re like all the</p>
<p>way on the bottom of Maslow&rsquo;s hierarchy, like, these are the</p>
<p>things that are most critical that they&rsquo;re starting to get</p>
<p>disrupted in a pretty severe way. You know, I think that</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s, I mean, that&rsquo;s the big question. So sex, it&rsquo;s I</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s becoming and this is where the transition starts to</p>
<p>happen. That a lot of people kind of say, hey, over the long</p>
<p>run, the temperature is going to go up by one degree Celsius</p>
<p>over a century, you know, who cares? But there are the</p>
<p>problem. The problem is this is that, you know, by the way, I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t disagree with me points out how insane some of these</p>
<p>policies are. I the topic is shifted to Are you a denier of</p>
<p>some science or other? No, no, listen, my point is not about</p>
<p>the science. My point is look at the collapse of the Sri Lankan</p>
<p>economy, because they implemented these ESG rules on</p>
<p>fertilizer, look at what&rsquo;s happening to the Dutch farmers</p>
<p>are being put out of work, because of California,</p>
<p>California today, govern Governor Newsom today said,</p>
<p>please don&rsquo;t use your electric power to charge your electric</p>
<p>cars. A week after they said, gas cars are now going to be</p>
<p>banned in the state. And so there&rsquo;s a great is going to go.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a deep irony underway today in California, because</p>
<p>and Fox News is obviously latched on to this story.</p>
<p>That has to do with the grid, though. I mean,</p>
<p>look, I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>whatever, whenever politicians invoke some crisis as the as the</p>
<p>reason, I&rsquo;m not talking about some authoritarian, I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>talking about the political measure, I&rsquo;ve learned to</p>
<p>distrust it. That&rsquo;s the point. And so I guess I&rsquo;m talking, you</p>
<p>know, what&rsquo;s happening in Europe right now is obviously gases</p>
<p>through the roof, because of the Ukraine war, the you know, the</p>
<p>price has basically gone through the roof. And so because of</p>
<p>that, they&rsquo;re not able to produce fertilizer. And one of</p>
<p>the byproducts of the production of fertilizer is co2, which</p>
<p>gets added to the production of beer to make it fizzy. Well,</p>
<p>guess what? The Germans are not only about to run out of gas,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re about to run out of beer. You think you think</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going to keep supporting the Ukraine war when they find</p>
<p>out that there&rsquo;s no beer for Oktoberfest. Forget it, I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>gonna be able to eat their heat their homes. They can&rsquo;t drink</p>
<p>beer in October. Yeah, this is the</p>
<p>we need to sit.</p>
<p>Just taking up just taking a poll, just taking a beat for a</p>
<p>minute, like taking taking off the table, the political</p>
<p>response. Are you as an individual concerned about the</p>
<p>impact of a changing climate on people and on the economy? And</p>
<p>are you interested as an investor in the private market</p>
<p>solutions to resolve some of those things that are obviously</p>
<p>going to become market driven problems? Take the government</p>
<p>out of the equation?</p>
<p>I think there may be a long term problem here. I&rsquo;m not sure like</p>
<p>how long it takes. I definitely think I&rsquo;m skeptical of this</p>
<p>claim that, you know, the world&rsquo;s going to end in the next</p>
<p>10 years. Because frankly, we&rsquo;ve been hearing that since the</p>
<p>1990s. I mean,</p>
<p>1988, there&rsquo;s a great headline article, by the way, in New York</p>
<p>Times, where it was like scientists in 1988, said that</p>
<p>all the oceans, all the ice caps will melt, the oceans will</p>
<p>flood the land by the year 2000. So there is a credibility</p>
<p>challenge associated with predicting, you know, kind of</p>
<p>long term outcomes like this, that that continues to kind of</p>
<p>foment, unfortunately, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, all my beachfront property would be underwater right now,</p>
<p>if all that came true. No, I&rsquo;m just kidding. But No, but but</p>
<p>look, it hasn&rsquo;t escaped my attention that many of the</p>
<p>political leaders who are claiming that we&rsquo;re facing</p>
<p>imminent threat of being underwater in 10 years, own</p>
<p>beachfront property, and fly on private jets. So obviously, you</p>
<p>know, I&rsquo;m not saying this isn&rsquo;t a long term problem. But I do</p>
<p>think they try to create an imminent crisis, so they can</p>
<p>shove through a bunch of bad policies that are very</p>
<p>destructive to the free bird.</p>
<p>Would you define what&rsquo;s happening with temperature and</p>
<p>extreme weather as a crisis or not?</p>
<p>Um, yeah, I mean, there&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s a, I would say there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a critical impact in and will continue to be a critical</p>
<p>impact in the food supply chain, in the quarters and years ahead,</p>
<p>because of what we&rsquo;re seeing. So severe drought and heat wave</p>
<p>in China right now. And by the way, food is not the only one</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s also the manufacturing supply chain. So</p>
<p>in the province of Sichuan in China, they actually lost power</p>
<p>because so much of the power is driven by hydroelectric plants.</p>
<p>So streams and water flow has slowed down and stopped. As a</p>
<p>result, there&rsquo;s less power as a result, the factories are being</p>
<p>shut down. As a result, key components for manufacturing in</p>
<p>the computing industry, and, and kind of mechanical goods are</p>
<p>not being produced at the rate that they were being produced</p>
<p>before that has a ripple effect in the supply chain, similar to</p>
<p>what we saw in COVID. And then in the food supply chain, we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>seeing a drought and a heat wave. Right now, we&rsquo;re coming</p>
<p>out of it in the Midwest in the United States, where we grow</p>
<p>corn and soybeans throughout Europe, and also in China. And</p>
<p>in China, they had 70 days in a row of record setting</p>
<p>temperatures, 70 days in a row, every day was a record. No</p>
<p>water, high temperatures, the they&rsquo;re just starting to assess</p>
<p>the crop damage, it looks pretty severe. There was</p>
<p>massive crop damage in the Midwest, in the corner, the</p>
<p>Corn Belt this year. And then obviously, European farmers are</p>
<p>having issues. And combine that with the geopolitical issues of</p>
<p>the Ukraine crisis and the natural gas pricing being so</p>
<p>high. One third of fertilizer of ammonia plants have been shut</p>
<p>down in Europe. And they think that ammonia and fertilizer</p>
<p>production may drop by as much as one half in Europe, because</p>
<p>of the crisis. So energy prices are so high, you can&rsquo;t make</p>
<p>fertilizer. So that energy is being also redirected into</p>
<p>other industry and support homes. So you believe it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>crisis. So I guess the question, yeah, people are turning on</p>
<p>their ACs in California this week, you know, you see that</p>
<p>Governor Newsom just said, our grid in California cannot</p>
<p>support excess electricity consumption. Therefore, one of</p>
<p>the biggest variables is electric cars. He&rsquo;s saying</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t plug in your electric cars this week. And that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>because of record high temperatures are about to hit</p>
<p>California in two days. So look, everyone says, hey, these</p>
<p>are kind of anecdotal stories. But no, it&rsquo;s really,</p>
<p>statistically, the frequency of extreme things happening is</p>
<p>continuing to climb. And then the impact is in the food supply</p>
<p>chain, the energy supply chain, and the manufacturing supply</p>
<p>chain. And there are follow on effects. Now, I&rsquo;m optimistic</p>
<p>that private market solutions will resolve these issues. And</p>
<p>that was my next question is, can we solve this or not? Yeah,</p>
<p>of course. I mean, look, we&rsquo;ve had crises since the dawn of</p>
<p>humanity. I mean, we were a starving, you know, we need a</p>
<p>crisis to solve some of these problems. These are pretty</p>
<p>economically obvious. Yeah, and that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s my point, the</p>
<p>private market will resolve because people want to have</p>
<p>electricity, they want to have food, they want to have not</p>
<p>want or need they need. And so so so the market will pay for</p>
<p>those things. And therefore, producers and technologists will</p>
<p>resolve to solutions to make that happen. So we just have to</p>
<p>have a problem and suffering and see it firsthand Shama, the</p>
<p>market again, our friend in the group chat that shall not be</p>
<p>named posted this meme. You guys saw it right, which said like,</p>
<p>an autistic school girl takes what was it? I have it here</p>
<p>quit school, the dominoes, the dominoes, you can show the</p>
<p>dominoes. But basically, it said, an autistic Swedish girl</p>
<p>decides to skip school is the little domino. And seven</p>
<p>dominoes later, this huge domino, it says the collapse of</p>
<p>Europe&rsquo;s energy grid. And without commenting on the</p>
<p>language used in the meme for a second, what is the point? The</p>
<p>point is, these conversations can so quickly go off the rails</p>
<p>and are not about national security and economics and</p>
<p>quickly become about moral virtue signaling that you missed</p>
<p>the point. The point in the United States just to be very</p>
<p>blunt, is that the cost of electricity has gone up by 46%</p>
<p>in the last decade, it will go up by another 40 odd percent</p>
<p>through 2030. So between 2010 and 2030, the cost of</p>
<p>electricity for every single American will have effectively</p>
<p>doubled, even though the ability to generate, particularly</p>
<p>from wind and solar, have been reduced by 90%. Now, why is</p>
<p>that? Well, it turns out that if you look inside the PNLs of</p>
<p>these utilities, it actually gives you the answer. So over</p>
<p>the next 10 years, we have to spend as a nation, just just on</p>
<p>upgrading power lines, $2 trillion. This is all cap, this</p>
<p>is all like crazy, crazy opex, right? capex improvements for</p>
<p>sunk cost investments, our power line infrastructure in</p>
<p>America is 20 plus years old, 30 years old, our generation</p>
<p>infrastructure is pretty poor. We have all of these failures,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t have enough peakers, we don&rsquo;t have ability to store</p>
<p>energy when we need it. So if you add this all up, I do think</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a huge economic incentive to solve it. And there</p>
<p>are practical ways to solve it. And that&rsquo;s what we have to stay</p>
<p>focused on. Because if we allow the moral virtue signaling to</p>
<p>get in the way, we&rsquo;re going to make some really stupid</p>
<p>decisions, we&rsquo;re going to keep trying to turn off nuclear.</p>
<p>Another thing that Elon said, you know, we&rsquo;re not going to</p>
<p>greenlight shale and nat gas, we don&rsquo;t have time for this. If</p>
<p>you actually believe this is a cataclysmic issue, you need to</p>
<p>basically be okay with hydrocarbons, because it is the</p>
<p>only credible bridge fuel we have to keep the world working</p>
<p>properly. Because otherwise, what David said, is right, we</p>
<p>are going to economically destroy parts of the world by</p>
<p>trying to race towards this net zero goal. By the way, guys, I</p>
<p>just want to take the you know, rip the bandaid off net zero by</p>
<p>2050 26. It is not possible. There is zero credible plans</p>
<p>that the world has to do it. So we have to take small</p>
<p>incremental steps. And many of them. Yeah, this is and we</p>
<p>should stay focused on that. Yeah, the interesting thing,</p>
<p>and you cannot let people guilt trip you because this is when</p>
<p>you make these stupid mistakes, like the entire continent of</p>
<p>Europe made, really, which is now going to cripple. Here&rsquo;s</p>
<p>economies of that of that entire continent unnecessarily,</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s the good news, all this virtue signaling and people</p>
<p>wanting to be green, and for whatever reason, all of that</p>
<p>now economics and geopolitical is forcing people to rethink</p>
<p>nuclear, the Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant, which is</p>
<p>the last one in California that&rsquo;s operational. It&rsquo;s being</p>
<p>voted on today as we&rsquo;re taping this, and it&rsquo;s expected that</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going to keep it online, the governor with the great</p>
<p>hair wants to keep it going. And the fascinating part about</p>
<p>this is how what choice does he have? Exactly. And so now the</p>
<p>awareness is so high about power and us losing it and asking</p>
<p>people to turn off their air conditioners, turn off, don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>plug in your cars, but people people don&rsquo;t understand how</p>
<p>nuclear energy even works. And they&rsquo;re like, get rid of it.</p>
<p>They went to a no nukes concert in 1978. And they haven&rsquo;t</p>
<p>changed their position since. But this is interesting. This</p>
<p>guy, Gene Nielsen, who&rsquo;s been a champion of this stuff. He said,</p>
<p>I thought our chances were zero of keeping this thing open. And</p>
<p>he said, what&rsquo;s you know, and he said, he told this conference</p>
<p>of attendees, this nuclear conference, that the effort to</p>
<p>maintain it, he said, what&rsquo;s happened since, you know, the</p>
<p>last six months has been like a snowball, that everybody has</p>
<p>changed their position just in the last year on shutting these</p>
<p>things down. And we saw obviously, Germany is re, you</p>
<p>know, thinking the three remaining of their six that</p>
<p>they were going to turn off, they&rsquo;re putting back on. And I</p>
<p>think we&rsquo;re going to see new ground broken. And Japan came</p>
<p>out just in the last week and said, they&rsquo;re going to build</p>
<p>more nuclear power, and nuclear power plants. Now think about</p>
<p>that. That&rsquo;s awesome. That&rsquo;s unbelievable. They had</p>
<p>Fukushima, the Germans shut off their nuclear because of</p>
<p>Fukushima. But guys, the Japanese are saying we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>building more fuka guys, Fukushima didn&rsquo;t happen by</p>
<p>accident. There was a like, an incredible tsunami, which was</p>
<p>triggered by an earthquake. You&rsquo;re talking about these</p>
<p>extremely long tail events. Yes, the retaining walls could</p>
<p>have been built better. But these are things we find we</p>
<p>iterate and we solve it was not the reason to shut down an</p>
<p>entire mechanism of energy generation, stupid mistakes</p>
<p>where they put it just too low in the wrong place. If they</p>
<p>just put it up the hill a couple of miles, it would have</p>
<p>been fine. But also, if you look inside of what happened,</p>
<p>there was enormous pressure inside of these companies to</p>
<p>basically, you know, take take actual direct blame and</p>
<p>responsibility. I get all of that. But these organizations</p>
<p>were shamed into turning these things off. That is not the way</p>
<p>to make good, smart decisions. Okay, so Gorbachev, the last</p>
<p>ruler of the USSR passed away this week, Sachs. Yeah, I mean,</p>
<p>I think this was a real milestone. You go back to the</p>
<p>1980s. And Ronald Reagan, the who had spent his entire career</p>
<p>being a cold warrior, saw the opportunity to basically do</p>
<p>business with with Gorbachev. Margaret Thatcher had told him</p>
<p>that this is a man we can do business with Gorbachev had</p>
<p>come to power in 1985. He had initiated reforms of the Soviet</p>
<p>system. He was a communist to be sure. But he introduced</p>
<p>political reforms called glasnost and economic reforms</p>
<p>called perestroika. And Reagan sees the opportunity to go meet</p>
<p>with him and they signed arms control treaty after arms</p>
<p>control treaty and ended the threat of mutually assured</p>
<p>destruction that the world had been living with since the</p>
<p>beginning of the Cold War. You got to remember that, you know,</p>
<p>the Cold War began shortly after World War Two. And we had</p>
<p>this doctrine of mutually assured destruction or mad and</p>
<p>the whole world is living under the shadow of nuclear</p>
<p>annihilation. This was showed repeatedly when I was a kid.</p>
<p>There was a TV movie called the day after the day it was</p>
<p>it was really scary. Lord, they terrorized us that America and</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re all gonna die. We had Did you ever have nuclear bomb</p>
<p>drills? We had to get under your desk? Yeah, I mean, so yeah,</p>
<p>so if you&rsquo;re like our age, you remember this that that movie,</p>
<p>by the way, that that was a TV event movie that was one of the</p>
<p>most widely watched movies. But there were others, you know,</p>
<p>Jim Cameron used this concept in the Terminator movies. You</p>
<p>know, it was something that people were really afraid of.</p>
<p>And Reagan sees the opportunity thought fundamentally that</p>
<p>nuclear deterrence was a moral that yet better to have</p>
<p>deterrence than a nuclear war, but that he if he could, he</p>
<p>sees the opportunity to negotiate the end of the Cold</p>
<p>War. And by the way, there were hardliners in his</p>
<p>administration, who did not want him to negotiate with</p>
<p>Gorbachev. But they ended up doing a series of meetings</p>
<p>culminated in 1986 at the Reykjavik summit. And they</p>
<p>signed deals to remove, you know, these, these INF system</p>
<p>deals now, and that ended the Cold War. And then basically</p>
<p>what happened is in 1989, the Berlin Wall came down.</p>
<p>Gorbachev allowed the Western the Warsaw Pact countries to</p>
<p>leave. And then in 1991, the Soviet Union collapsed. So,</p>
<p>you know, he gets a lot of credit for being willing to</p>
<p>reform that system. Now, the sad thing is, if we were fast</p>
<p>forward 30 years later, where are we today, we&rsquo;re back in a</p>
<p>new Cold War with Russia, I mean, that we&rsquo;ve been spending</p>
<p>a good part of this year talking about the threat of a</p>
<p>nuclear use. And, you know, this was a problem that we</p>
<p>thought was solved 30 years ago. And now we&rsquo;re back with</p>
<p>it today. And you&rsquo;ve got to ask, have the successors of,</p>
<p>you know, Reagan and, and, and George Herbert Walker Bush,</p>
<p>the people who inherited our foreign policy over the last</p>
<p>30 years, have they done as good a job as Reagan did,</p>
<p>Reagan ended the Cold War, we are back in a new Cold War.</p>
<p>Why? What is the reason for this? There&rsquo;s been a, a series</p>
<p>of stupid policies that now have put the risk of nuclear</p>
<p>war back on the table.</p>
<p>My interest in Gorbachev is slightly different. He is an</p>
<p>incredibly important character. The second half of the 20th</p>
<p>century, undeniable, you know, won the Nobel Prize, as you</p>
<p>said, David kind of ended the Cold War. But the most</p>
<p>important thing, in my opinion, was the precursor to</p>
<p>perestroika, and why he did it. And as you said, like, you</p>
<p>know, this is a fairly ardent communist, although he had</p>
<p>really interesting views, like he ran a very kind of like,</p>
<p>open kind of Politburo, where folks could debate, and he,</p>
<p>you know, promoted a lot of young people from within all of</p>
<p>these interesting things. But the most important thing, and</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s written about this a lot is the reason that he embarked</p>
<p>on perestroika was because USSR at the time had an incredibly</p>
<p>poor work ethic, terrible productivity, and horrible</p>
<p>quality goods. And I think that there&rsquo;s something to be</p>
<p>learned by that. Because at the tail end of communism,</p>
<p>essentially, where you had central planning, central</p>
<p>imposed economic principles, what happened, people did not</p>
<p>feel that they had any ownership in the outcome. No</p>
<p>agency, no agency whatsoever. And I think that there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>really important lesson to observe there, which is that if</p>
<p>governments get too actively involved, this doesn&rsquo;t just</p>
<p>happen in Russia, it happens everywhere. It&rsquo;s happening in</p>
<p>California. We just talked about it. It&rsquo;s happening where</p>
<p>we live right now. And if you look at then what happened</p>
<p>afterwards, it became the aristocracy that basically</p>
<p>ruled the USSR before and then fighting against all these</p>
<p>folks that wanted reforms. And that created this schism, which</p>
<p>then perverted capitalism for, you know, seven or eight years</p>
<p>through Yeltsin until Putin got there. And that&rsquo;s what created</p>
<p>the oligarch class and, you know, really exacerbated a</p>
<p>bunch of wealth capture by a handful of folks that may or</p>
<p>may not have deserved it. And I&rsquo;m not going to judge that.</p>
<p>But I just think it&rsquo;s really important to understand that he</p>
<p>was forced to embark on this, because of all of these state</p>
<p>central planning policies. And so it&rsquo;s just an important</p>
<p>lesson for Americans in democracy, which is careful if</p>
<p>you want more government, you might get more government guys.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union, their economy used to run on what they called</p>
<p>five year plans, it was incredibly centralized, it was</p>
<p>all run by the government. And, you know, this was communism.</p>
<p>And the 20th century, the second half, especially, was a</p>
<p>giant battle of systems, not just of countries, not just the</p>
<p>Western Bloc, you know, led by the US, the free world versus</p>
<p>the Soviet Union, the Warsaw Pact, it was also a battle of</p>
<p>philosophies and systems, it was the philosophy of state</p>
<p>control versus freedom, and, and a free economy and freedom</p>
<p>one, you know, the free economy won in that battle. And the</p>
<p>crazy thing is, 30 years later, we&rsquo;re talking about socialism</p>
<p>being a viable doctrine, you have politicians, basically</p>
<p>saying that they are socialists. But 30 years ago, you would</p>
<p>have been like, that was</p>
<p>and the point is, example after example, empirical evidence,</p>
<p>well documented of just how it doesn&rsquo;t work. And I guess the</p>
<p>thing is, you know, we all say, like, you just have to learn it</p>
<p>for yourself. You know, like, you&rsquo;ll tell your kids to do to</p>
<p>not do something ad infinitum stuff. Yeah, they got to touch</p>
<p>the stove themselves and get burned. We are about to go do</p>
<p>that in California. Can you imagine if like people who want</p>
<p>to be socialists here, who bind us if they had to be in a food</p>
<p>line or have rations? Literally, Russia had food lines, and they</p>
<p>were rationing food in the 1980s. Like, well, yeah,</p>
<p>a large driver of Gorbachev basically negotiating these</p>
<p>peace settlements with, you know, with Reagan, and this</p>
<p>nuclear, you know, demilitarization was in part</p>
<p>because he knew he couldn&rsquo;t fight. Right? It was this</p>
<p>realization that say, that&rsquo;s that centralized system was</p>
<p>collapsing. Yeah, he could not keep up. Reagan began an arms</p>
<p>build up, and there was an arms race and they were losing.</p>
<p>They were losing. They were losing. This is and this is why</p>
<p>like people should not misunderstand what Gorbachev</p>
<p>was. He was not necessarily some democratic freedom fighter.</p>
<p>He was a person who was observing the on the ground</p>
<p>conditions of a socialist system, decay their ability to</p>
<p>compete. And so he had to capitulate before it was forced</p>
<p>upon him. Right. Meanwhile, the United Right, this is why I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t think he deserves as much credit as Ronald Reagan is</p>
<p>because at the end of the day, Gorbachev would have kept</p>
<p>communism going if he could have if he could have if he</p>
<p>could have wanted the Soviet Union to stick stick together.</p>
<p>I mean, he that&rsquo;s right, but his but but I think to his</p>
<p>credit, when the things start to collapse, he didn&rsquo;t use</p>
<p>violence and repression to try and hold it together. So, you</p>
<p>know, he was a he was a reformer. He was a liberalizer</p>
<p>pragmatist, maybe and a pragmatist and didn&rsquo;t use</p>
<p>violence. But and ultimately, he was a partner for Ronald</p>
<p>Reagan. Remember, Ronald Reagan began this gigantic arms</p>
<p>buildup. He was denounced as a cowboy who would get us in</p>
<p>World War Three. But when he had the chance to negotiate a</p>
<p>deal with Gorbachev, he took it and they basically got arms</p>
<p>control. And it was because Reagan was able to sit on top of</p>
<p>an extremely productive capitalist system that allowed</p>
<p>him to make those investments that made that capitulation.</p>
<p>Basically, and I think that that&rsquo;s another thing for a lot</p>
<p>of us to to understand, which is free market capitalism,</p>
<p>removing these degrees of decision making, give us</p>
<p>degrees of freedom. And I&rsquo;ve said this before on the last</p>
<p>part, the great thing about the IRA and what Chuck Schumer did</p>
<p>is actually will be written in 10 or 15 years from now,</p>
<p>because when we get to energy independence, when every home</p>
<p>is resilient, the national security calculus in America</p>
<p>changes wholeheartedly overnight. Yeah, I mean, think</p>
<p>about two years ago, right, but I didn&rsquo;t cancel that. Okay,</p>
<p>well, listen, no, it&rsquo;s true. If you&rsquo;re willing to use natural</p>
<p>gas and fracking America is one of the richest energy</p>
<p>countries in the world. We produce a lot of oil, too. Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, listen, it will change everything if we can really go</p>
<p>all in on all of the categories nuclear. It&rsquo;s just it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>the fossil fuels. And if you know, if you let the capital</p>
<p>markets do and the free markets do what they&rsquo;re meant to do,</p>
<p>they will empower the government to do great things for all of</p>
<p>you. All citizens. Yes, I agree with 100%. And the reason we</p>
<p>want to stop it is because we have a couple of examples of,</p>
<p>you know, extreme wealth. And I think that&rsquo;s something we have</p>
<p>to think about is like, are the extreme is the extreme wealth</p>
<p>created for a certain class, enough to stop the prosperity</p>
<p>train that we actually have an American Jason, the politicians</p>
<p>in California think they can run fast food businesses better</p>
<p>than the people who own those, those restaurants, people have</p>
<p>never worked in their lives. No, I mean, we have the great</p>
<p>thing is they wouldn&rsquo;t. Yeah. The great thing is we have a</p>
<p>running a B test, which will show whether this state central</p>
<p>planning can work or not. And again, if we refuse to want to</p>
<p>listen to the examples of Russia, or all of these other</p>
<p>countries that have tried this, then so be it, we will know in</p>
<p>the next three to five years that these policies actually</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t work. And actually, that it actually accelerates the</p>
<p>exact hellscape that they think they&rsquo;re trying to avoid.</p>
<p>But you know, not only to my point about foreign policy, not</p>
<p>only are we forgetting the lessons of this Cold War, the</p>
<p>economic lessons that a free enterprise system generates</p>
<p>more wealth and prosperity, and more national greatness, more</p>
<p>ability to fund a defense budget, create a better</p>
<p>economy. Not only does it do all those things we forgot, not</p>
<p>only have we forgotten that, but also, we have abrogated, we</p>
<p>have ended every single defense control and arms control treaty</p>
<p>with the Russians that Reagan and Gorbachev signed. Why? Why</p>
<p>did we do that? Now our nuclear missiles are pointing each</p>
<p>other again. And you know what, Russia&rsquo;s a much poorer country</p>
<p>in the US, we&rsquo;re actually 15 times richer than them. During</p>
<p>the Cold War, at their peak, we were only three times richer</p>
<p>than them. But we&rsquo;re 15 times richer, but they still got over</p>
<p>6000 nukes. Why do we get rid of all those arms control</p>
<p>treaties? Why have we basically alienated them?</p>
<p>Yeah, we talked, we said it before, like, you&rsquo;re dealing</p>
<p>with a pragmatist, and Putin&rsquo;s a KGB agent.</p>
<p>Maybe you feel like Putin isn&rsquo;t someone we can deal with now,</p>
<p>but he was someone we could have dealt with 10 years ago, 20</p>
<p>years ago, I mean, we missed the opportunity to deal with him,</p>
<p>Jason.</p>
<p>If he was a rational actor, we would be able to deal with him.</p>
<p>I think the only way he&rsquo;s actually going to be really the</p>
<p>only way we&rsquo;ll be able to deal with him is if he doesn&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>the oil market he has, like he just has too much power from</p>
<p>that oil. And over time, that&rsquo;s the solution. We have to be</p>
<p>energy independent, you know, I think Europe is learned that</p>
<p>lesson. We have was a communist, he was an heir to Stalin, and</p>
<p>yet Reagan&rsquo;s could still do business with him and sign an</p>
<p>arms control treaty, so that we could end the risk of mutually</p>
<p>assured destruction. We took you don&rsquo;t have to believe you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have to believe that Putin is a good guy in order for us to</p>
<p>avoid getting back into a Cold War, which is the situation we</p>
<p>find ourselves in now, how does it benefit us to have Russian</p>
<p>nukes once again, pointed at our heads? Yeah, I mean, and the</p>
<p>reason why with the reason why we alienated him, Jason has</p>
<p>nothing to do with him being a madman or whatever it is, because</p>
<p>we brought NATO, which he views as a hostile military alliance</p>
<p>right up to his border. And by the way, listen to this video</p>
<p>from Gorbachev. Gorbachev was asked about NATO expansion. In</p>
<p>front of the US Congress, he was giving a talk to them. And</p>
<p>they asked him, Gorbachev, what do you think about NATO? And</p>
<p>what did he say? He said that you cannot humiliate a country</p>
<p>this way, and expect there to be no consequences. Gorbachev was</p>
<p>against NATO expansion. When when basically George Herbert</p>
<p>Walker Bush and the Secretary of State James Baker went to</p>
<p>Gorbachev to argue on behalf of German reunification. This is</p>
<p>basically in 1990. Baker made the promise to Gorbachev not one</p>
<p>inch eastward. Gorbachev said, Yes, okay, they can reunify. But</p>
<p>we do not want NATO moving up to our border. Baker made that</p>
<p>promise, we have brought NATO up to their border. That is why</p>
<p>Putin regards us with hostility.</p>
<p>Yeah. And I think Europe regards him with hostility, and</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re scared of him because he keeps invading countries. So</p>
<p>yeah, there&rsquo;s takes two to tango. But hey, this has been</p>
<p>episode 94.</p>
<p>It does. It does take two to tango. But you have to ask has</p>
<p>the US foreign policy over the last 30 years that&rsquo;s gotten us</p>
<p>in a new Cold War with Russia? Has that been a successful part</p>
<p>foreign policy? They have undermined all the good work that</p>
<p>Ronald Reagan and Gorbachev did together to end the Cold War. We</p>
<p>are back in a new Cold War. And you need to find some blame.</p>
<p>Putin has some blame, but so does the US State Department. So</p>
<p>does the US Department and Europe, Europe has a big part of</p>
<p>the blame to hear because he&rsquo;s their neighbor. Yeah. For the</p>
<p>sultan of science, the rain man and Reagan library chairman, are</p>
<p>you the chairman of the Reagan library? Let me ask you this.</p>
<p>When you were a kid, did you have a Reagan poster in your</p>
<p>room? Have you ever owned a Reagan poster?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ve definitely owned a picture of Reagan and</p>
<p>Ronald Reagan. Listen, Jason,</p>
<p>did you ever hang around Reagan poster or a picture in your</p>
<p>dorm at Stanford? Yes or no?</p>
<p>Listen, Ronald Reagan, that&rsquo;s a yes. Hold on a second. Ronald</p>
<p>Reagan won the Cold War without firing a shot. He gave us the</p>
<p>greatest economy the US has ever had. He ended the inflation and</p>
<p>stagflation in the 1970s. And again, he avoided getting us</p>
<p>into any of these major wars. Tell me the politician who you</p>
<p>can have lunch with anybody who&rsquo;s the politician who you</p>
<p>revere, who has a track record like that?</p>
<p>Um, yeah, I mean, I, I guess one would say Bill Clinton, you</p>
<p>know, would be the closest, you know, great president of our</p>
<p>lifetimes, right? You would agree with that?</p>
<p>I think he was a good, good president, especially number</p>
<p>two behind Reagan. And I remember he benefited from the</p>
<p>economy that Reagan, whatever reason you would agree with me,</p>
<p>Clinton is right behind Reagan.</p>
<p>Reagan and Clinton in since like 1950, something easily top two.</p>
<p>Yeah, easily, easily. It&rsquo;s hard for sacks to say.</p>
<p>Eisenhower is very good. But head and shoulders, I think,</p>
<p>like for practically what they dealt with at their point of</p>
<p>time. Amazing.</p>
<p>All right, listen, sacks. I know you love Reagan.</p>
<p>And Reagan and Nixon, Reagan and Bill Clinton,</p>
<p>one on each side of you for next week. Will you do that for</p>
<p>us? I gotta go guys. I gotta go too. All right. Love you,</p>
<p>sexy. I love you all next time. Bye. Bye. Love you too. Happy</p>
<p>birthday to me. Thanks, bro.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll let your winners ride.</p>
<p>Rain Man, David</p>
<p>We open source it to the fans and they&rsquo;ve just gone crazy with</p>
<p>it. Love you.</p>
<p>Besties are gone.</p>
<p>We should all just get a room and just have one big huge orgy</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re all just useless. It&rsquo;s like this like</p>
<p>sexual tension that they just need to release somehow.</p>
<p>What you&rsquo;re about to be.</p>
<p>What you&rsquo;re about to be.</p>
