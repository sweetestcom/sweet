<p>Ôªøhello everyone I have a special guest uh</p>
<p>sometimes I do videos on a lot of</p>
<p>different topics today we&rsquo;re going to do</p>
<p>one on a really amazing success story</p>
<p>from Bart Ratliff and so um this guy I</p>
<p>saw he sent a video and just literally</p>
<p>blew me away in five months he lost 90</p>
<p>pounds okay 90 pounds it&rsquo;s incredible so</p>
<p>welcome Bart thanks for for being on Dr</p>
<p>Robert thank you so much it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>honor to be uh speaking to you number</p>
<p>one just because of all the wonderful</p>
<p>education he&rsquo;d give me over the last uh</p>
<p>six months and uh the results</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s produced wow well it&rsquo;s quite</p>
<p>impressive I mean I know some people</p>
<p>might be watching and they might they</p>
<p>probably maybe they lost less than they</p>
<p>might be a little bit more frustrated</p>
<p>but you know what</p>
<p>um I want to cover some of the things</p>
<p>that you did and some of the barriers</p>
<p>that you ran into because people always</p>
<p>want to know like okay what did he do so</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s first talk a little bit about</p>
<p>um what type of pattern of fasting did</p>
<p>you do did you do you know 16 hours 18</p>
<p>hours what type of fasting you do but at</p>
<p>the back by the way the way I jumped in</p>
<p>and this started on May 23rd of 22. I I</p>
<p>started at one meal a day and uh through</p>
<p>the education through videos I knew how</p>
<p>effective that would be for me and to</p>
<p>say the least my first couple of days</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s a transition and of course</p>
<p>had the had the headaches the first day</p>
<p>or two but I knew that I took I was 100</p>
<p>committed and devoted because I knew</p>
<p>this would work performing and I kind of</p>
<p>just kind of held fast and stayed the</p>
<p>course and because I knew it would it</p>
<p>would I would no longer have that so one</p>
<p>meal a day I&rsquo;m a ketogenic diet that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>good I think um you did mention this</p>
<p>before and I want to bring this up I</p>
<p>mean you tried this a while ago but at</p>
<p>that time there was some stress involved</p>
<p>you know and I always bring this up like</p>
<p>um when you have family or spouses that</p>
<p>maybe are not on the same page it&rsquo;s more</p>
<p>difficult I mean it&rsquo;s crazy more</p>
<p>difficult because like uh kind of create</p>
<p>you know when are you gonna eat and then</p>
<p>you gotta be in front of the food or</p>
<p>just a lot of disagreements so I think</p>
<p>you did have a situation that through</p>
<p>you basically you started it a long time</p>
<p>ago and then it worked but then you got</p>
<p>off because of that for a period of time</p>
<p>so maybe you can just touch on that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>bad you&rsquo;re bad a couple years ago and it</p>
<p>had some success I was actually referred</p>
<p>to a one meal a day by a friend of mine</p>
<p>uh effort out of Salt Lake City and I</p>
<p>said one meal a day are you nuts you</p>
<p>know and then I did some research on it</p>
<p>I I kept on hearing about this omad I</p>
<p>thought it was Oman I said this must be</p>
<p>some guy that created this plan you know</p>
<p>I said oh one meal a day it makes sense</p>
<p>yeah right so uh but yes we were uh</p>
<p>my significant other at the time we we</p>
<p>started it and we had uh success and we</p>
<p>were luckily I was I found you on</p>
<p>through YouTube on the ketogenic you</p>
<p>know to include that with the one meal a</p>
<p>day and then helped us stay focused and</p>
<p>then after several months you know then</p>
<p>there was some other ideas shared and uh</p>
<p>sometimes the uh uh negativity and the</p>
<p>environment that you&rsquo;re in</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>sometimes it</p>
<p>she focuses you on your ultimate goal</p>
<p>even though you&rsquo;ve seen how effective it</p>
<p>is and I let</p>
<p>um my um</p>
<p>I just we just kind of got off track and</p>
<p>I kind of got off track even though it</p>
<p>was working very well for me but when</p>
<p>you have other influences in your life</p>
<p>at the time it definitely can deter</p>
<p>somebody and and I was thinking more</p>
<p>about somebody else than myself and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s kind of what happened but</p>
<p>luckily I found my way back so so a</p>
<p>couple years later you picked it back up</p>
<p>and then you you were at um your Peak</p>
<p>weight was like 313 pounds right well</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when I was started no my pick</p>
<p>weight I was I was 335 when I started a</p>
<p>couple years ago man and but luckily I</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t gain it all back and I was</p>
<p>sitting into 3 13 when I started back in</p>
<p>May at the end of May so um</p>
<p>question when you were in um High School</p>
<p>were you were you a thin guy growing up</p>
<p>in Chinese I</p>
<p>oh I was always a big guy</p>
<p>I grew up in high school I think I was</p>
<p>just thinking about this the other day I</p>
<p>was talking to a friend of mine that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>also been inspired by my story and even</p>
<p>in high school I think my junior year</p>
<p>was 260. and um and then because I</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t even I ended up going going to</p>
<p>six four I think it was my sophomore</p>
<p>year in college but it was only like six</p>
<p>two when I graduated but I was 260 then</p>
<p>I came down to 2 30. I was you know back</p>
<p>and forth a lot of pressure on my health</p>
<p>and uh my always on diets oh really</p>
<p>yours I you know so I went through the</p>
<p>yo-yo string over the years but um so</p>
<p>that that yeah I was a big guy in high</p>
<p>school and then I kind of slimmed down</p>
<p>and then when College happened you know</p>
<p>back in the 80s saying you know I I was</p>
<p>having a good time and it was certainly</p>
<p>not focused then on my health and</p>
<p>nutrition back then to say the least as</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s been like that for many many years</p>
<p>but uh but yeah I I was I think the</p>
<p>highest was in in high school even in</p>
<p>junior high when I was a I was bigger I</p>
<p>always played football but 216 was</p>
<p>usually 260 and then I I would go down</p>
<p>and then like come back up</p>
<p>so so a couple years ago when you</p>
<p>decided uh before you even started</p>
<p>looking and discovered like oh keto</p>
<p>um was there something that motivated</p>
<p>you that said you know what I need to do</p>
<p>this</p>
<p>uh actually my significant other uh she</p>
<p>had an event coming up and we decided uh</p>
<p>she was starting to uh uh to be better</p>
<p>and and do some working out and then I</p>
<p>of course I wanted to support my wife</p>
<p>and uh so I joined along with her and</p>
<p>then I as I was doing some research 20</p>
<p>years 20 years previous I had done uh</p>
<p>read a book called Body for Life by Bill</p>
<p>Phillips and of course his philosophy I</p>
<p>really loved his philosophy on the</p>
<p>strength training and the cardio doing</p>
<p>the high intensity uh hit hitch training</p>
<p>which I really loved but he was more of</p>
<p>a six Miller guy uh six mil a day guy</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what my mindset has been all</p>
<p>these years up until a couple years ago</p>
<p>and um but that was one of the reasons</p>
<p>we started it and then there was a guy</p>
<p>that was featured in that body for black</p>
<p>book Everett happened to live in Salt</p>
<p>Lake and we got together and he told me</p>
<p>about the one meal a day and then uh we</p>
<p>started doing that then a couple weeks</p>
<p>later we got back together and I said</p>
<p>well I&rsquo;m kind of tired all the time I</p>
<p>said we ought to do more fat he</p>
<p>understood you know find out you know do</p>
<p>keto and that&rsquo;s how actually I found you</p>
<p>without the burger wow</p>
<p>um and then as far as</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>the meals that you ate during this</p>
<p>process</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>did you did you do it exactly like the</p>
<p>book or did you kind of have some times</p>
<p>where you fell off the wagon like uh you</p>
<p>know and like what kind of uh discipline</p>
<p>did you have as you gone gone through</p>
<p>this to keep your car can be enough for</p>
<p>my current Journey are you talking about</p>
<p>for my current Journey yeah okay oh well</p>
<p>you know what I I I focus in on my Mills</p>
<p>one of the things I always try to focus</p>
<p>in on are as you say especially on my</p>
<p>protein I will do a grass-fed uh uh</p>
<p>grass-fed grass finish uh hamburger I</p>
<p>mean hamburgers probably uh 70 of my</p>
<p>meals so I&rsquo;ll do basically I&rsquo;ll buy the</p>
<p>pound the grass-fed grass finish beef</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll cut it in half I&rsquo;ll do eight ounces</p>
<p>one day and then I&rsquo;ll do that two to</p>
<p>three but usually three to four days a</p>
<p>week and then I&rsquo;ll mix in some salmon</p>
<p>some Wild Cuts salmon and then some eggs</p>
<p>and then maybe one day uh once every</p>
<p>couple weeks I&rsquo;ll throw in eggs as my</p>
<p>protein and then of course I always do</p>
<p>my big salad and it&rsquo;s kind of funny</p>
<p>over the last six months</p>
<p>I mentioned this in that video I sent</p>
<p>you but I I kind of start my day</p>
<p>watching one of your videos I love how</p>
<p>you you five to six days a week you</p>
<p>always update a new video so a lot of</p>
<p>times I&rsquo;ll run through and kind of see</p>
<p>the videos that I might not have seen or</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s been a while since I&rsquo;ve seen but</p>
<p>one of the things I remember when I</p>
<p>started I was all Spanish I said you</p>
<p>know Popeye Your Spinach you know and</p>
<p>then I started saying you know the</p>
<p>benefits of the lettuce and of the</p>
<p>arugula and I said arugula I never</p>
<p>thought about that and I but now it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s I always kind of more of a</p>
<p>plan day review I&rsquo;m a consultant and a</p>
<p>strategist when it goes to marketing and</p>
<p>technology so I&rsquo;m always big about that</p>
<p>with uh with the projects I&rsquo;m working on</p>
<p>so I started really kind of focusing in</p>
<p>on that so now that&rsquo;s one of the ways I</p>
<p>start my start my meals now I do my big</p>
<p>salad and uh you know you say five to</p>
<p>seven cups I had this massive bowl and</p>
<p>it I figured about seven ounces I get</p>
<p>the containers with the organic or</p>
<p>regular and the organic leafy greens and</p>
<p>so I just chop everything up I usually</p>
<p>try to find like a nice Red Pepper or</p>
<p>something like that and then I fill up</p>
<p>this big bowl it&rsquo;s usually about seven</p>
<p>ounces I have no idea how many cups it</p>
<p>is but I know it&rsquo;s a massive salad and</p>
<p>um at first I was doing like the blue</p>
<p>cheese and then the more I</p>
<p>saw your videos and I said oh wait a</p>
<p>minute you know how about the organic uh</p>
<p>the organic extra virgin olive oil so I</p>
<p>started buying that and then I just</p>
<p>recently saw the video of the olive oil</p>
<p>that you use so I finally said well I</p>
<p>need to upgrade my extra virgin olive</p>
<p>oil so I just I actually ordered some</p>
<p>luckily I found it on Amazon the exact</p>
<p>type that you use same with the uh with</p>
<p>the uh the um apple cider vinegar so I</p>
<p>was doing the Epic list of Braggs and</p>
<p>then you had had a video about the brags</p>
<p>and and the other the other I can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>remember the name of it but I have it in</p>
<p>my cabinet right now so I upgraded that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s amazing the strength of that apple</p>
<p>cider vinegar how much stronger that it</p>
<p>is than than the ones that I was using</p>
<p>the mothers brag and then I went to the</p>
<p>one that you recommended it&rsquo;s like twice</p>
<p>as strong so so what I&rsquo;ll do I&rsquo;ll add a</p>
<p>little organic lemon juice in that as</p>
<p>well to kind of help out help out with</p>
<p>that so oh yeah I tell you it&rsquo;s uh you</p>
<p>know um you find all sorts of</p>
<p>interesting things I actually went to</p>
<p>this Farm where they make this olive oil</p>
<p>twice and uh I was just like</p>
<p>come on you got to be kidding you you</p>
<p>guys put that much care that much energy</p>
<p>into producing this I&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>all right um you still be I&rsquo;m gonna I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna use this so I I when I find</p>
<p>something like that I&rsquo;m gonna tell</p>
<p>people about it because it&rsquo;s so so</p>
<p>um healthy at many different levels so I</p>
<p>mean even if you don&rsquo;t put on your salad</p>
<p>you should probably drink a couple</p>
<p>teaspoons a day or tablespoons it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s like great but</p>
<p>um so you sounds like you&rsquo;re kind of</p>
<p>just you know</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just kind of doing what someone</p>
<p>else you&rsquo;re piggybacking off of someone</p>
<p>else&rsquo;s success story which or successful</p>
<p>actions which which I&rsquo;m doing because I</p>
<p>experiment with everything all sorts of</p>
<p>therapies I have three different</p>
<p>therapies I haven&rsquo;t even told anyone</p>
<p>about I&rsquo;m actually doing them myself</p>
<p>actually more than that and if it works</p>
<p>I will let you know well we&rsquo;re very</p>
<p>excited to hear that right oh yeah oh</p>
<p>yeah so</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>so this is really good and then um what</p>
<p>about do you have um any problem like</p>
<p>social events parties things like that</p>
<p>that you kind of go off the program a</p>
<p>little bit here and there or or do you</p>
<p>just have any way of pushing through</p>
<p>that what do you have that right now I I</p>
<p>do I&rsquo;m very well aware uh usually wants</p>
<p>to mental health how I&rsquo;ll have to do a</p>
<p>business trip and a lot of them a lot of</p>
<p>times I mean I was just in Miami back in</p>
<p>uh back in September and uh</p>
<p>um happened to be my birthday a week as</p>
<p>well so I was uh hanging out so I I did</p>
<p>stay pretty focused uh I I think I might</p>
<p>have done</p>
<p>um one extra meal two different days and</p>
<p>I uh I did have a bite of birthday cake</p>
<p>and ice cream you know I mean I like a</p>
<p>couple by seven so I might have had a</p>
<p>couple of drinks but I one of the things</p>
<p>I did face out was specifically alcohol</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not like I&rsquo;m a bit big drinker</p>
<p>anyway but but I do know I loved your</p>
<p>video and the benefits of alcohol that</p>
<p>was so funny and and also the cheat day</p>
<p>with Karen with the big uh the big guy</p>
<p>the big uh uh Hatchet that she had in</p>
<p>her head that was funny that&rsquo;s one of</p>
<p>the great things I love about your</p>
<p>videos you do have a great sense of</p>
<p>humor and it&rsquo;s very very easy to watch</p>
<p>and uh I I do appreciate uh appreciate</p>
<p>how you frame all those but uh but the</p>
<p>way how I handle that Dr Berg just like</p>
<p>uh on my most recent trip to Texas to</p>
<p>see a group of high school friends you</p>
<p>know</p>
<p>I um</p>
<p>um I do stay very focused on my eating I</p>
<p>might eat a little bit more than I</p>
<p>normally do on my one meal a day and uh</p>
<p>there might be uh you know if I have a</p>
<p>cold beer or something like that like I</p>
<p>said it&rsquo;s just that I might have one but</p>
<p>the way I handle that when I get back</p>
<p>home I go back to my normal one meal a</p>
<p>day eating and then after two days of</p>
<p>eating my back on my process I&rsquo;ll do a</p>
<p>48 hour fast and because they&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>that reset screen I&rsquo;m back on the train</p>
<p>but uh but that first day after going</p>
<p>off my program if I incorporate if I</p>
<p>have a if I&rsquo;m especially eating out</p>
<p>because I eat out every every meal when</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m traveling and there&rsquo;s always going</p>
<p>to be let&rsquo;s face it garbage in the food</p>
<p>that they serve you even no matter how</p>
<p>careful you are but uh um but it does</p>
<p>that that first day back I mean you</p>
<p>definitely feel the effect of that not</p>
<p>eating properly and uh but that&rsquo;s how I</p>
<p>do it I do two days I say steadfast and</p>
<p>like I&rsquo;m normally eat but then I do a 48</p>
<p>hour and that usually just snaps it</p>
<p>right out I&rsquo;m back in the back in back</p>
<p>in play again well I can tell you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>been watching my videos because you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing all that you&rsquo;re doing these</p>
<p>applying all these different things for</p>
<p>every one or two yeah right that&rsquo;s great</p>
<p>what about um like um through the period</p>
<p>of time uh I think it&rsquo;s uh you&rsquo;re down</p>
<p>95 pounds right now total</p>
<p>um was it was it is it always consistent</p>
<p>you lose this much weight per week or is</p>
<p>it kind of like you lose more and then</p>
<p>less and then nothing and then more and</p>
<p>then less than what how did it go with</p>
<p>your losing weight well you know my</p>
<p>first four months I I took it off pretty</p>
<p>quickly and uh I I always incorporate uh</p>
<p>activity into into my game plan now for</p>
<p>of course at first I mean that that was</p>
<p>like 12 minutes and 12 minutes of of</p>
<p>walking on the treadmill and then I kind</p>
<p>of went up to doing the rowing machine</p>
<p>and then then I as as I got healthier</p>
<p>right because it really I mean it was</p>
<p>great that I was losing the weight but</p>
<p>it was more about feeling good and being</p>
<p>healthy because I know with good health</p>
<p>comes the weight loss so</p>
<p>I did lose more weight at first because</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s face it I was 313 pounds I am six</p>
<p>foot four and it&rsquo;s all what are you</p>
<p>carrying I said yeah I carry it but I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>a whole lot I mean I had this jacket I</p>
<p>wear that I bought a couple years ago</p>
<p>and I mean I put it on now and it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>like I wrap it around I mean it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>that oh my God I can&rsquo;t believe that I I</p>
<p>just how much I filled that thing out uh</p>
<p>over the last couple months I&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>averaging about 10 pounds per month and</p>
<p>one of the things I don&rsquo;t do I do not</p>
<p>weigh every day that&rsquo;s uh you know</p>
<p>because I know I mean you drink a couple</p>
<p>bottles of water the night before your</p>
<p>way so they go up a couple pounds I mean</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s still uh intense but I do</p>
<p>try to focus in maybe once or twice a</p>
<p>month away and uh but uh but like I said</p>
<p>I mean I&rsquo;m extremely happy at the weight</p>
<p>I am I mean my God I can walk into a</p>
<p>store and I can buy I&rsquo;m buying jeans in</p>
<p>the 30s I&rsquo;m very serious wow and uh you</p>
<p>know it&rsquo;s so weird because it they feel</p>
<p>snug but it&rsquo;s not there&rsquo;s nothing like</p>
<p>hanging over I mean I&rsquo;m I&rsquo;m just it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just it&rsquo;s just absolutely mind-blowing</p>
<p>to me uh to be at that point because</p>
<p>like I said 20 years ago I did lose</p>
<p>Sydney significant amount of weight say</p>
<p>the body of Life Body for Life and it</p>
<p>was a great time and but then I I just</p>
<p>put it right back on that was the whole</p>
<p>six mil Gay Day concept I said my God if</p>
<p>I would have only had this education 20</p>
<p>years ago I mean</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s people there&rsquo;s women</p>
<p>watching this going wow uh that that</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t my case I can&rsquo;t seem to lose 10</p>
<p>pounds uh per month I just want to</p>
<p>mention one thing if there&rsquo;s any women</p>
<p>watching this is</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>uh you have um a situation where men</p>
<p>typically have it in the midsection less</p>
<p>than the hips and the thighs right well</p>
<p>the type of fat</p>
<p>that is uh hips thighs buttocks is um is</p>
<p>usually more superficial fat versus the</p>
<p>fat around the organs in the midsection</p>
<p>and the thing to know is that it&rsquo;s uh</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s less influenced Believe It or Not</p>
<p>by this insulin problem now</p>
<p>what can we do with that information</p>
<p>well</p>
<p>if you do the diet okay you&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>lose the stomach for sure in this whole</p>
<p>thing but if you have more hip and thigh</p>
<p>weight you you&rsquo;re going to have to</p>
<p>actually add more exercise especially to</p>
<p>get more lean muscle to burn more</p>
<p>calories and that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s going to have</p>
<p>to be um</p>
<p>more than even someone that doesn&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>that weight like if you have more hip</p>
<p>weight you&rsquo;re going to have to also add</p>
<p>some pretty serious workouts to the</p>
<p>point where you um you recover don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>ever exercise over a recovery but</p>
<p>definitely you&rsquo;re gonna have to</p>
<p>add that exercise component in there</p>
<p>more than</p>
<p>anyone else so I just want to add that</p>
<p>in there and then you will see more</p>
<p>change but just to rely just in the diet</p>
<p>you may lose your gut but you may not</p>
<p>lose the hip weight</p>
<p>um I also wanted to for those of you</p>
<p>that are watching</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>what would be like</p>
<p>the biggest tip that you would tell</p>
<p>people or advice if you had to give like</p>
<p>one tip if someone</p>
<p>thinking about this but they&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not quite sold on it yet what uh what</p>
<p>would you tell them</p>
<p>um to motivate them to get started</p>
<p>well actually uh educate yourself</p>
<p>educate yourself on the on the process</p>
<p>and I highly recommend I mean your your</p>
<p>YouTube channel is phenomenal uh one of</p>
<p>the things I do if I do have any</p>
<p>specific questions I&rsquo;ll go to YouTube</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll just I&rsquo;ll type in my question</p>
<p>and put Dash Dr birds and a great thing</p>
<p>99 of the time there&rsquo;s a video that</p>
<p>addresses those specific questions and</p>
<p>uh one of the things uh it&rsquo;s really kind</p>
<p>of stay tuned and stay dialed in and</p>
<p>really understand your why on why you</p>
<p>want to move forward with this with this</p>
<p>health transformation or this lifestyle</p>
<p>change for yourself I mean my whole deal</p>
<p>was number one</p>
<p>um look I&rsquo;m 57 years old you know I</p>
<p>certainly I I&rsquo;ve not been fortunate</p>
<p>enough to have a family and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>something that you know in the right</p>
<p>situation that would be something that</p>
<p>would just be lovely for myself to to to</p>
<p>start a family you know and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>something and I that I keep in my back</p>
<p>of my mind but the biggest thing</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>is when I start my day I I do I really</p>
<p>do I pull up when I get up in the</p>
<p>morning uh of course I do my scoop of uh</p>
<p>my scoop of wheatgrass I do my scoop of</p>
<p>uh uh uh</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>um oh my gosh</p>
<p>the um I totally went blank I think you</p>
<p>you mentioned electrolytes electrolytes</p>
<p>thank you so much yeah I mean that&rsquo;s how</p>
<p>I start my day every morning and then</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll I&rsquo;ll pull up the I&rsquo;ll pull up the</p>
<p>YouTube channel normally by the time</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m on the mountain time you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>already uploaded your video for the day</p>
<p>even though it might not really apply to</p>
<p>me a lot I&rsquo;ll watch it because a lot of</p>
<p>times I&rsquo;ll get great tips and tricks on</p>
<p>how to stay more dialed in I mean this</p>
<p>is how my transition the way I ate six</p>
<p>months ago to the way I eat now I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>being more dialed in and more conscious</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m buying organic to grass-fed do</p>
<p>grass-finished meat uh what type of</p>
<p>apple cider vinegar what type of olive</p>
<p>oil I mean I buy the organic balsamic</p>
<p>vinaigrette too you know and I I read</p>
<p>the labels and one thing I don&rsquo;t do</p>
<p>doctor I don&rsquo;t do these this all these</p>
<p>keto bars and keto stuff that&rsquo;s in the</p>
<p>stores good</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t I don&rsquo;t do those I don&rsquo;t do</p>
<p>those I I mean every now and then I&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>do a pint of rubble I love the rebel</p>
<p>okay I mean or or something like that</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s very rare maybe once a month</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll treat myself or do something like</p>
<p>that but uh but having that stuff around</p>
<p>people think and then you see all this</p>
<p>stuff on Facebook and Instagram all</p>
<p>these rules on these keto experts and</p>
<p>all they&rsquo;re doing is showing me how to</p>
<p>make snacks snack snack snack snack</p>
<p>snack I mean what uh hello</p>
<p>I mean it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s actually</p>
<p>comical to see all this stuff I mean it</p>
<p>looks delicious I mean if you&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>mix like a little keto treat I mean</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some great ways you can make it</p>
<p>yourself not by the</p>
<p>stuff on my on the shelves I mean I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>not going to say garbage but I did</p>
<p>mention that word but uh but yeah</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s quite fascinating when</p>
<p>you look at this and they put keto on</p>
<p>the label people say oh I could buy that</p>
<p>well look at the label it&rsquo;ll really open</p>
<p>your mind and uh one of the other things</p>
<p>I I don&rsquo;t know if I mentioned this um as</p>
<p>far as my my big why you know besides uh</p>
<p>wanting a long healthy life is both of</p>
<p>my parents were greatly affected by</p>
<p>Alzheimer&rsquo;s all the times and uh my lost</p>
<p>my mom in 2006 and at the young age of</p>
<p>73 years old okay and then my dad it was</p>
<p>about to turn 89 this is in 2014 but I I</p>
<p>helped care for them both my mother and</p>
<p>my father and uh that was very difficult</p>
<p>for me to see them go through that and</p>
<p>uh and my sister</p>
<p>my lovely sister Margaret she&rsquo;s uh uh we</p>
<p>both experienced that and she has always</p>
<p>been more Health minded than myself and</p>
<p>uh and it&rsquo;s just so wonderful uh</p>
<p>catching up and chatting with her and</p>
<p>she just loves seeing my journey and I I</p>
<p>have so much support from my friends and</p>
<p>I have a tremendous amount of friends</p>
<p>that are lucky enough to develop some</p>
<p>tremendous relationships over the last</p>
<p>35 years and and my sales and</p>
<p>Consultants speaking</p>
<p>um and it&rsquo;s just so nice to to see such</p>
<p>encouragement uh through my</p>
<p>transformation and luckily another great</p>
<p>thing about it it&rsquo;s uh apparently I&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>inspired a whole lot of people I love</p>
<p>hearing people&rsquo;s progress my friend AJ</p>
<p>down in uh Florida and Chris a high</p>
<p>school buddy of mine they reach out to</p>
<p>me ask me and I just said well this is</p>
<p>what works for me and this is how I</p>
<p>found out how to do this a lot of times</p>
<p>if they have questions I&rsquo;ll just Google</p>
<p>Dr Berg and just put it in there and</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll send them the video to help them be</p>
<p>on track so but it&rsquo;s uh but that&rsquo;s as</p>
<p>far as yeah that&rsquo;s uh one of the videos</p>
<p>I mean uh the keto Basics how to</p>
<p>supercharge your prolonged fasting I</p>
<p>love that video uh any but anytime and</p>
<p>by the way when I do those 48 or the 72</p>
<p>hours which I try to do at least 172</p>
<p>hour a month and I&rsquo;ve done that for the</p>
<p>last couple months uh I&rsquo;ll watch the</p>
<p>videos the day before I plan on doing</p>
<p>that and then the next morning I watch</p>
<p>that video every single morning you can</p>
<p>really help me stay focused and on track</p>
<p>on the race I&rsquo;m not doing this to lose</p>
<p>additional weight I&rsquo;m doing it</p>
<p>for the health benefit</p>
<p>well I have to say bar you&rsquo;re definitely</p>
<p>the epitome of the what I&rsquo;m trying to do</p>
<p>with people get give them the right</p>
<p>tools and you&rsquo;re applying everything</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m telling you so well done very</p>
<p>well done</p>
<p>proud of you great job I think you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to inspire a lot of people from</p>
<p>this video so</p>
<p>um so I do want to thank you for your</p>
<p>time and going over this because people</p>
<p>are going to definitely you know there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>probably a lot of people are just going</p>
<p>to get started just because they want to</p>
<p>lose weight too and now you kind of made</p>
<p>it broke it down so it&rsquo;s easy for them</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>anyway I appreciate your time and uh</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll have to do a post video when you</p>
<p>get down to 150 I&rsquo;m just being sarcastic</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not going to go that low but I</p>
<p>love it but now I uh uh now I I</p>
<p>appreciate uh I appreciate taking the</p>
<p>time to speak to me and uh you know one</p>
<p>of the I I have a really a big service</p>
<p>mentality and this is one of the things</p>
<p>I really enjoy uh about sharing my uh my</p>
<p>transformation and my and my updates I</p>
<p>used to do a little post on Facebook</p>
<p>every two weeks and it&rsquo;s not the picture</p>
<p>I need to sell anything and you see so</p>
<p>much of that in this industry in the</p>
<p>health industry it&rsquo;s just it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>really disturbing sometimes to see that</p>
<p>and uh but I do that in the fact that</p>
<p>there there is a solution uh no matter</p>
<p>how old you are or what your health</p>
<p>level is I mean you know 57 years old I</p>
<p>was you know plus over 300 and uh you</p>
<p>know if you kind of follow the follow</p>
<p>the plan and educate yourself and stay</p>
<p>focused uh it can certainly happen to</p>
<p>you even when you hit those soft spots</p>
<p>the uh the one of the barriers and then</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when you you can just push</p>
<p>through those take assistant and do not</p>
<p>give up exactly well thank you so much I</p>
<p>appreciate your time and this is great I</p>
<p>think you&rsquo;re going to help a lot of</p>
<p>people from just telling your story this</p>
<p>is awesome thank you Dr Berg it&rsquo;s been a</p>
<p>pleasure and I look forward to the</p>
<p>update awesome all right have a great</p>
