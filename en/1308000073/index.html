    <p>I now have a chief of staff. He&rsquo;s pretty great. He&rsquo;s worked</p>
<p>for me for a while and he&rsquo;s doing a great job but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>actually really helped. I will say that and then I started a</p>
<p>family office. Wow. Congrats. What does that mean? You have a</p>
<p>place in your home that you call an office? Yeah, you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>like to bring by your refrigerator. There&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>office. Is that&rsquo;s the family office. Yeah, it&rsquo;s the family</p>
<p>goes in there to talk about office stuff. Where does Jade</p>
<p>put the stickies that say we&rsquo;re out of granola bars in the</p>
<p>family office?</p>
<p>Hey, everybody, welcome to another episode of the all in</p>
<p>podcast episode 72 part do with us today again, the prince of</p>
<p>panic attacks, the sultan of science, David Friedberg.</p>
<p>Yes, and also Zephyr of Zoloft and also as you&rsquo;re hearing</p>
<p>cackling, the Duke of Degeneracy, uh the dictator</p>
<p>himself, Chamath Palihapitiya, and of course, everybody&rsquo;s</p>
<p>uh favorite, the rain man himself, the drunk history</p>
<p>channel uncle, David Sacks. I mean, David, I I follow you on</p>
<p>Twitter. You&rsquo;re tweeting 50 times a day. Oh, I was thinking</p>
<p>the same thing. When do you work? What has happened to you?</p>
<p>You won&rsquo;t meet with startups anymore. I bring you startups.</p>
<p>You said, you know what, I&rsquo;m no longer gonna be like stuck in</p>
<p>your room tweeting. I don&rsquo;t do first meetings. That is the end</p>
<p>of your career. Huge mistake. No, it preserves it preserves</p>
<p>my energy. There&rsquo;s nothing more draining than endlessly</p>
<p>spending your day in first meetings. No, why don&rsquo;t you</p>
<p>just have a short first meeting like a 15 minute first meeting?</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s what, you know, we have a team for. I love it.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t because we know exactly what we&rsquo;re looking for.</p>
<p>SAS investing is very metrics driven and so the first meeting,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s yeah, exactly. So, it&rsquo;s like, you know, the first</p>
<p>meeting, we just find out, do they meet our basic threshold</p>
<p>for love it for growth and yeah, exactly. Yeah. So, we run</p>
<p>the numbers and then II will meet with them if they look</p>
<p>good. I love this. I would like all VCs to take the same</p>
<p>approach and I will let everybody know my DMS are open</p>
<p>Jason at Calacanis.com. I will take the first meeting. I need</p>
<p>to call you after this. One of our businesses which is not in</p>
<p>SAS has started to sell SAS software and we&rsquo;ve already</p>
<p>booked $40 million of **** ACV by complete accident from zero.</p>
<p>Wow. You stepped in it and I need some advice. Okay. Yeah,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s talk. Alright, everybody. It&rsquo;s been a bit of a crazy</p>
<p>couple of weeks here and we have to start with the war in</p>
<p>Ukraine and do a bit of an update. It&rsquo;s been over 20 days.</p>
<p>The death toll continues to climb. We don&rsquo;t know exact</p>
<p>numbers here. It&rsquo;s very hard to get information. We&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>experts. We don&rsquo;t have boots on the ground but according to the</p>
<p>New York Times, 7000 Russian troops have been killed and</p>
<p>Zelensky said on March 12 1300 Ukrainian troops have been</p>
<p>killed. I think we&rsquo;ve got three or four angles we need to talk</p>
<p>about here. One, I want to talk about food supply with</p>
<p>Friedberg since you ran climate.com and have a lot of</p>
<p>expertise in that and of course, Ukraine and Russia are</p>
<p>the breadbasket of the world. I want to talk about markets of</p>
<p>course, but let&rsquo;s go to our history channel uncle first</p>
<p>sacks. You have been going down the rabbit hole looking at the</p>
<p>history of this. Let me just ask you just a point in question.</p>
<p>Is Russia losing the war? And if they are losing the war, if</p>
<p>that is a pass, is that even a possibility that they&rsquo;re losing</p>
<p>the war? Are they losing the war? And then what is the exit</p>
<p>ramp here? And what does it mean on a go forward basis?</p>
<p>Right? I think great question. So here&rsquo;s where I think we stand</p>
<p>three weeks into the war is that Putin clearly miscalculated. He</p>
<p>thought this would be a cakewalk. Obviously, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>turned out not to be the Ukrainians have put up very</p>
<p>fierce resistance. The Russians have taken very serious</p>
<p>casualties and losses. And so the war is very much, you know,</p>
<p>up in the air, it&rsquo;s the outcome is very much in doubt. So I</p>
<p>think, you know, Putin was overconfident, made a political</p>
<p>economic and obviously humanitarian mistake. But I</p>
<p>think three weeks in here is where I would characterize</p>
<p>things is it feels to me like the West might be making a</p>
<p>similar mistake of sort of excessive overconfidence and</p>
<p>triumphalism, meaning that we think the rest of this war is</p>
<p>going to be a cakewalk. And the reason I say that, let me just</p>
<p>give you some examples and then tell you why it may not be a</p>
<p>cakewalk. So you&rsquo;ve got Francis Fukuyama had a piece this week,</p>
<p>basically, he&rsquo;s back with the end of history, he predicts</p>
<p>that, you know, imminent Russian defeat, and that there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be a new birth of freedom. For the West, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to be like the Bush doctrine and 20 years of failed</p>
<p>policy in the Middle East never happened. You got David from,</p>
<p>you know, all that predicting mission accomplished, just like</p>
<p>the Iraq war, he said the springtime is gonna be bad for</p>
<p>anyone who bet on Putin, his words, which, in his view, is</p>
<p>anyone who isn&rsquo;t a basically a neocon who favors regime change,</p>
<p>you had a piece get a lot of circulation over the last week</p>
<p>in the US China perception monitor by, by I think, a former</p>
<p>Chinese observer named Hu Wei. And he basically predicted that</p>
<p>China would be under so much pressure by what the Russians</p>
<p>have done, you know, in terms of humanitarian losses, that</p>
<p>they would come out, basically denouncing Russia, and support</p>
<p>the West. And then, of course, I think the final example of</p>
<p>what you might call Western triumphalism right now is that</p>
<p>absolutely no one in Washington seems to be pushing for a</p>
<p>ceasefire. They&rsquo;re, you know, they&rsquo;re all paying lip service,</p>
<p>at least to this no flows, no fly zone idea, Biden and the</p>
<p>squad seem to be the last holdouts for the idea of not</p>
<p>imposing no fly zone. So I would say right now, the West</p>
<p>seems to be very confident about the way that this war is</p>
<p>going, and not inclined to make any compromises or concessions.</p>
<p>I just want to flag quickly why that you know, why there might</p>
<p>be some clouds on the silver lining. So you had a Washington</p>
<p>Post article, first of all, warning, it was very</p>
<p>interesting that Ukrainian military progress may not be as</p>
<p>great as their quote, stratcom, their strategic communications,</p>
<p>you know, aka propaganda. So in other words, the Ukrainians are</p>
<p>very effective at fighting the information war, but the</p>
<p>Russians are still making progress on the ground. You also</p>
<p>had this Washington Post story about neo Nazis flocking from</p>
<p>all over Europe to Ukraine to fight for the cause. Again, that</p>
<p>story got it&rsquo;s very troubling, and it got no likes or retweets,</p>
<p>because it just doesn&rsquo;t fit the great narrative here. You&rsquo;ve got</p>
<p>the slow motion humanitarian&hellip;</p>
<p>Is that true?</p>
<p>Like, yeah, let&rsquo;s, let&rsquo;s come back to let me lay out all the</p>
<p>issues and we can come back to it. You&rsquo;ve got the slow motion</p>
<p>humanitarian disaster of, you know, a billion people across</p>
<p>the world potentially starving. If the spring planting doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>happen, which we should let Friedberg speak to more, you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>got the fact that Russia can still escalate this war. I mean,</p>
<p>they could still rubble cities, Belarus could enter the war. And</p>
<p>you know, God forbid they could even use WMD. And then you have</p>
<p>this idea, this dream of toppling Putin, probably look,</p>
<p>it could happen, but probably a fantasy you had 200,000</p>
<p>protesters pro war protesters turn out in Moscow today,</p>
<p>nationalism is still strong in Russia. Yes, there&rsquo;s anti war</p>
<p>protesters there. But the Russian people, at the moment,</p>
<p>seem to be still behind Putin. And then I think you had today,</p>
<p>the foreign minister of China came out with a statement</p>
<p>really throwing cold water on the idea that they support the</p>
<p>West, they basically denounced the West for NATO expansion.</p>
<p>So this whole idea of the Chinese bowing to Western media</p>
<p>pressure, which they, in other contexts, call the Baizhou</p>
<p>influence. I think that&rsquo;s a fantasy that is not going to</p>
<p>happen. So look, I think that, you know, you know, we all</p>
<p>support the Ukrainian cause. We all support their desire for</p>
<p>freedom to their freedom from domination from this, this</p>
<p>Russian war of aggression. But what I wonder about is whether</p>
<p>this would be the opportune time for Washington to try and</p>
<p>push for a ceasefire instead of a no fly zone. And we should</p>
<p>talk more about what that might look like.</p>
<p>Can I give you a psychological assessment of I think what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>happening right now? Yes. Great. Just as somebody who, as you</p>
<p>know, you guys and I were just joking, but six days just being</p>
<p>mostly off the grid with my notifications off. I was really</p>
<p>like, honestly, like you, you kind of like go through this</p>
<p>dopamine fast. And what it actually helps you do is pick</p>
<p>out better signal. And, you know, with all respect, sex, I</p>
<p>think, like a lot of what you said is not really as</p>
<p>meaningful signal as the following, which is the most</p>
<p>important thing that happened was both sides basically said</p>
<p>the surface area of a deal was very much in sight, and that</p>
<p>they were down to three or four points. And I think that that</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t get reported nearly as much as it probably should have.</p>
<p>And what I thought was psychologically interesting was</p>
<p>that as soon as that was said, the next few days was when the</p>
<p>rhetoric got ratcheted up extremely aggressively on both</p>
<p>sides. And the way that I interpret that typically is</p>
<p>having done deals, that&rsquo;s typically when you&rsquo;re closest</p>
<p>to a deal, and you&rsquo;re trying to get the last few T&rsquo;s and C&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>And in that same construct as applied to Ukraine and Russia, I</p>
<p>suspect what&rsquo;s happening is they both put out the trial balloon,</p>
<p>it was well received on both sides, the surface area is now</p>
<p>down to a few points. I&rsquo;m not saying that those are</p>
<p>justifiable in the end. But I think that if both of these two</p>
<p>folk parties want to come to a ceasefire, which I think it</p>
<p>does, we&rsquo;re probably much, much closer than anybody thinks. And</p>
<p>right now, all of this rhetoric is meant to basically try to</p>
<p>get the other side to budge a little bit more. And so I</p>
<p>suspect, and you know, I could be completely wrong, is that</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re much closer to a ceasefire than anybody thinks. And I</p>
<p>suspect that you could see something in the next two to</p>
<p>three weeks. And I think that that&rsquo;s really hopeful, because</p>
<p>you want this thing to come to an end.</p>
<p>The thing I&rsquo;m trying to parse here, and I don&rsquo;t know if anybody</p>
<p>here can even answer this, is how did how did we either</p>
<p>underestimate or overestimate, depending on the time, Russia&rsquo;s</p>
<p>ability to invade another country?</p>
<p>I think I think the thing is, we have, we can&rsquo;t even estimate</p>
<p>correctly. So for example, there was something that said there</p>
<p>was 100 out of 100, Russia has 170 battalions, apparently, I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s true or not, right, of which 100% in,</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s true or not, of which Ukraine</p>
<p>apparently destroyed 50, of which we don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>true or not. So we&rsquo;re left to guess. And unfortunately, what</p>
<p>that does is that people psychologically then fit as</p>
<p>David has used in the past your priors, what are your biases?</p>
<p>Right? What narrative fallacy do you want to believe, and then</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to fit. So the pro Russian factions will say</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s entirely not true. The pro Ukrainian factions will say,</p>
<p>actually, it&rsquo;s even greater than that huge sustained military</p>
<p>losses. The truth is somewhere in the middle that will only get</p>
<p>accounted for after a ceasefire is in place. So I think we</p>
<p>almost need to again, we can get caught in this fog of war,</p>
<p>and talk about this stuff in ways which we don&rsquo;t accurately</p>
<p>know. Or we can level up and say the thing that we both know is</p>
<p>there was on the record statements by the Foreign</p>
<p>Minister of Russia and the President of Ukraine, that a</p>
<p>ceasefire and the surface area of that ceasefire is within</p>
<p>sight. And unless something is materially changed, and then in</p>
<p>the last three days, which it hasn&rsquo;t, it means we are really,</p>
<p>really close to this being done.</p>
<p>So I agree with a lot of what Tomas said, I don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>contradicts anything I said before, I agree that there was a</p>
<p>big piece of news this week that caused markets to rally for</p>
<p>three days, which is the announcement of a proposed 15</p>
<p>point peace deal. And the we do know sort of the key features of</p>
<p>that deal. It means that the three big features are you</p>
<p>Ukrainian neutrality, so they don&rsquo;t become members of NATO,</p>
<p>you had Zelensky saying that NATO membership was off the</p>
<p>table. Ukraine can&rsquo;t host foreign troops, bases or</p>
<p>weaponry, there&rsquo;d be limits on Ukraine&rsquo;s military, but they</p>
<p>would get security guarantees from the allies. So it wouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>be a complete demilitarization. And then the other pieces of it</p>
<p>were Ukraine recognizing Russia&rsquo;s control of Crimea,</p>
<p>recognizing that&rsquo;s not coming back. And then some sort of</p>
<p>independence recognized for the disputed territories in the</p>
<p>Donbass. So I think you&rsquo;re right, Chamath that everybody</p>
<p>now knows the broad contours of what a peace deal would look</p>
<p>like. And the markets are starting to price in them</p>
<p>getting to that peace deal. But I&rsquo;m worried that if you look at</p>
<p>it from the point of view of what people in Washington say</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s no pressure here, coming from Washington, for</p>
<p>Zelensky, who&rsquo;s basically our client, he&rsquo;s an American client</p>
<p>to make a deal. You know, if you compare this to say the 1973</p>
<p>Yom Kippur War, where the US was on the side of Israel, but</p>
<p>still acted as a peacemaker and got a ceasefire done. You know,</p>
<p>Kissinger got that deal done, even though we were on the</p>
<p>Israeli side. You don&rsquo;t really hear anyone in Washington</p>
<p>saying, let&rsquo;s get a deal done. So I hope you&rsquo;re right. But</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re not, we&rsquo;re not talking about the elephant in</p>
<p>the room, which is that in the Yom Kippur War, the unitary</p>
<p>resolve and the military dominance of America was</p>
<p>undisputed. And so as a result, its ability to be the mediator</p>
<p>was also undisputed. We&rsquo;ve already talked about this when</p>
<p>Biden called the UAE and Saudi, they wouldn&rsquo;t even pick up the</p>
<p>phone. The people that are negotiating this priest to</p>
<p>priest peace treaty right now are Naftali Bennett, and</p>
<p>Emmanuel Macron. So we&rsquo;re not at the table. So I think a lot of</p>
<p>what we&rsquo;re hearing as well, is just a lot of the rejection and</p>
<p>the psychological, you know, kind of anger that we have to</p>
<p>not being even part of the process.</p>
<p>The world doesn&rsquo;t want us to have such an outsized point is</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s we&rsquo;ve moved past that whether you wanted us to be</p>
<p>involved in it or not, we&rsquo;re not involved. And we are not the</p>
<p>principal mediators in this. And we I hope to God that Israel</p>
<p>and France and whoever else is at the table gets this done.</p>
<p>Yeah, I agree with that. But here&rsquo;s my concern is I think</p>
<p>everyone knows the broad contours of the deal. But if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re Russia, or you&rsquo;re Ukraine, you&rsquo;re getting daily</p>
<p>reports of what&rsquo;s happening on the battlefield. And if you</p>
<p>think you&rsquo;re winning, you have an incentive to stall the peace</p>
<p>process to cement greater gains and get more leverage for those</p>
<p>remaining details and negotiating points. And so if</p>
<p>Zelensky thinks that the Ukrainians are making progress</p>
<p>on the battlefield, he&rsquo;s going to wait. And so neither one of</p>
<p>them, I think left to their own devices can be fully trusted to</p>
<p>make a deal. I think you need the US applying some pressure or</p>
<p>acting in a pot in a constructive way towards the</p>
<p>process. And I think it&rsquo;s a huge problem that the US is not</p>
<p>viewed as a peacemaker. We&rsquo;re basically viewed as so partisan</p>
<p>and on the side of Ukraine.</p>
<p>David, we&rsquo;ve talked on this pod about us not being the global</p>
<p>police officer of the world, and that other people need to stand</p>
<p>up. So maybe the lesson here is, you know, maybe strategically,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s and it&rsquo;s not like we were called on and we didn&rsquo;t stand</p>
<p>up. We weren&rsquo;t called on. Well, okay, that&rsquo;s what we assume</p>
<p>that. I mean, we don&rsquo;t have perfect information either. But</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s let&rsquo;s get to Friedberg here. I think the other wrinkle</p>
<p>in all of this, and I think it&rsquo;s quite positive is sanctions are</p>
<p>seeming to have a profound impact here and people are</p>
<p>looking at them as potentially, maybe cyber warfare and just,</p>
<p>you know, actual tactical warfare on battlefields is less</p>
<p>important than economic warfare. And Russia has been</p>
<p>essentially cancelled from the global economy from visa to</p>
<p>McDonald&rsquo;s to exports. And these sanctions are not just</p>
<p>government sanctions. These are people opting into them,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s corporations, and other entities saying we&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>not going to do commerce with Russia. Unfortunately, and this</p>
<p>is something you have great expertise on. And so we&rsquo;re lucky</p>
<p>to have you here to talk about it. People may or may not know</p>
<p>this. I&rsquo;m happy to be here. This is the breadbasket of the</p>
<p>world. They export more wheat than anybody. And they also</p>
<p>export fertilizer, soybeans and some other inputs, which we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>talked about previously, that provide meat for the world. So</p>
<p>what can you tell us about the downstream effects of there not</p>
<p>being potentially, or half as much crops coming out next year,</p>
<p>and what would happen in places that are the beneficiaries or</p>
<p>dependent on wheat and fertilizer from Russia.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a number of first order and then second order</p>
<p>effects that are not just about sanctions, but also about export</p>
<p>controls by Russia that are creating swings in food markets</p>
<p>like we&rsquo;ve never seen, and will almost certainly lead to</p>
<p>widespread famine by the end of this year at this point. So the</p>
<p>first important point to note is about 15% of the world&rsquo;s</p>
<p>calories come from wheat, about a third of that wheat comes from</p>
<p>Russia, Ukraine, Russia has banned export of wheat. And the</p>
<p>wheat spring planting season is like now this week. And there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not a lot of planting going on, you know, a lot of commodity</p>
<p>folks are in the field trying to figure out who&rsquo;s actually going</p>
<p>to go to field and plant, but no one&rsquo;s making, you know, the</p>
<p>concerted effort that they normally would under normal</p>
<p>circumstances. So not only is the current wheat supply in</p>
<p>Russia, Ukraine blocked up and cannot make its way to countries</p>
<p>like Africa, or countries in Africa and elsewhere, but the</p>
<p>future planting season is now significantly at risk. And again,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s 15% of global calories. And I just to take a step back,</p>
<p>the whole planet Earth operates on a 90 day food supply. So once</p>
<p>we stop making food, humans run out of food in 90 days. So</p>
<p>another way to think about that is our food supply excess our</p>
<p>capacity in excess of about 25% of our global production. So if</p>
<p>our global production goes down by 12%, we&rsquo;ve lost half of our</p>
<p>global food supply. And that&rsquo;s not just linearly across all</p>
<p>nations, what happens is the most vulnerable nations lose</p>
<p>their food supply first, and the richer nations buy that food</p>
<p>supply to secure their population calories. And so you</p>
<p>very quickly see a bifurcation happen when you have a shortage</p>
<p>in a food supply like this of just a few points, where</p>
<p>suddenly famine is a real risk. And we already have about 800</p>
<p>million people on earth that are subsisting on below 1200</p>
<p>calories a day. So this very quickly tips the bucket in a</p>
<p>significant way in a number of countries that&rsquo;s going to be</p>
<p>really awful. And that&rsquo;s just on the wheat supply and wheat</p>
<p>planting problem. The bigger problem is the energy price</p>
<p>problem and the phosphorus and potassium problem. All</p>
<p>fertilizer is made up of nitrogen, phosphorus or</p>
<p>potassium. Those are the three major types of fertilizer that</p>
<p>farmers around the world have to use every year in order to</p>
<p>grow that crop without fertilizer plants don&rsquo;t grow.</p>
<p>Nitrogen is made from natural gas, 98% of the world&rsquo;s ammonia</p>
<p>is made from natural gas, natural gas prices, as you guys</p>
<p>know, have doubled and the and the futures market looks like</p>
<p>in some places natural gas prices going up like 4x. As a</p>
<p>result, the price of ammonia fertilizer, nitrogen based</p>
<p>fertilizer has gone from $200 a ton to $1,000 a ton. So it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>five times as expensive to buy basic ammonia fertilizer</p>
<p>today than it was a few weeks ago, or a few months ago. And so</p>
<p>this is now leading a lot of farmers and then the other big</p>
<p>problem is phosphorus. So phosphorus, you know, by some</p>
<p>estimates, I mean, you know, there&rsquo;s a little variation</p>
<p>around here, but about 10% of the world&rsquo;s phosphate comes out</p>
<p>of Russia. And about, you know, call it 25% of the world&rsquo;s</p>
<p>potassium comes out of Russia, potash, both of those markets</p>
<p>are blocked up, they are they are sanctioned, and they have</p>
<p>banned exports Russia has through the rest of 2022. So</p>
<p>around the world, the cost to make nitrogen fertilizer has</p>
<p>skyrocketed because of natural gas prices, because of the</p>
<p>Russia problem. And Russia is not exporting potassium and</p>
<p>phosphorus. And as a result, the price of nitrogen has gone</p>
<p>from 200 1000, the price of potassium has gone from 200 to</p>
<ol start="700">
<li>And the price of phosphorus has gone from 250 to 700. So now</li>
</ol>
<p>it&rsquo;s so expensive to grow a crop that a lot of farmers around</p>
<p>the world are pulling acres out of production. And they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>actually going to grow less this year than they would have</p>
<p>otherwise, because it is so expensive, and they cannot</p>
<p>access fertilizer locally to plant crops. So not only do we</p>
<p>have the wheat problem, we now also have the fertilizer</p>
<p>problem, and the acres coming out of production problem. And</p>
<p>so food supplies are going to go down even further. And this is</p>
<p>going to become even more catastrophic. And so there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>scrambling going on right now, you know, food prices around the</p>
<p>world, as a result, everyone starts buying up all the</p>
<p>commodities, they buy up all the corn, they buy up the</p>
<p>soybeans, they buy up the wheat, and the price for corn has</p>
<p>nearly doubled. Whereas, you know, from where it was in July</p>
<p>of 2020, the price of soybeans, the price of wheat are all</p>
<p>skyrocketing. And in a lot of countries, they cannot afford to</p>
<p>acquire and individuals cannot afford to buy food with the</p>
<p>skyrocketing commodity prices.</p>
<p>Can I ask you a question? I think it&rsquo;s estimated that the US</p>
<p>food supply, if you could X out the waste would actually feed</p>
<p>most of the developing world, because I think 30 to 40% of all</p>
<p>of our food is wasted. Can you do something with that?</p>
<p>Yeah, that is actually true. A lot of that happens at the point</p>
<p>of consumption. So it&rsquo;s in people&rsquo;s homes. So it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>reverse supply chain problem, where, you know, we throw away a</p>
<p>lot of like stale bread and cereal that goes bad or</p>
<p>whatever. There&rsquo;s some in the fresh vegetables market, but</p>
<p>generally, the core calorie producing commodities are rice,</p>
<p>wheat, potatoes, and corn. Those commodities don&rsquo;t go bad in the</p>
<p>supply chain, they end up getting tossed out at the end of</p>
<p>the supply chain, which is at the point of consumption at home.</p>
<p>So, you know, I&rsquo;m not sure there&rsquo;s a real solution there</p>
<p>right now. The bigger issue is like, how do you get bulk</p>
<p>commodities to the places that are going to need them over the</p>
<p>next 12 months. So look, we&rsquo;re right now we&rsquo;re reducing food</p>
<p>supplies, stocks around the world, there&rsquo;s strategic</p>
<p>reserves that are getting opened up and being released.</p>
<p>As that starts to get the planet&rsquo;s diminished, and as the</p>
<p>production kind of numbers start to come out, it looks like less</p>
<p>acres are in production. You know, and God willing, we have a</p>
<p>good weather year everywhere this year, because you know, a</p>
<p>bad weather year in some markets could completely decimate the</p>
<p>remaining supply that&rsquo;s coming out this year. Regardless, it is</p>
<p>going to be a humanitarian disaster within a year. And we</p>
<p>will see hundreds of millions of people go starving. And there</p>
<p>will be potentially, I think you said hundreds of millions of</p>
<p>people, hundreds of millions of people will never happened in</p>
<p>the history of million people already live on below 1200</p>
<p>calories a year right now.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re predicting that 100 over 100 million people will die</p>
<p>because of this. I don&rsquo;t know about death, famine, like famine</p>
<p>is this like, you know, short of calories, you know, within that</p>
<p>within a market, it&rsquo;s not like, hey, there&rsquo;s no food, like, you</p>
<p>know, there will be strategic reserves release, there will be</p>
<p>stuff, but it won&rsquo;t be enough. We just don&rsquo;t have enough in the</p>
<p>way supply chains are set up. There just isn&rsquo;t enough. And so</p>
<p>we found another supply chain weakness, like we did in COVID</p>
<p>over and over again, and boys will be released. But then</p>
<p>hoarding is starting. So David, you take it after this. But the</p>
<p>one question I had was maybe talk to me about this concept of</p>
<p>hoarding, because there seems to be a cascading effect. And you</p>
<p>kind of</p>
<p>well, yeah, it&rsquo;s not just talking about a little bit is as</p>
<p>with any market guys, as you know, when there&rsquo;s scarcity,</p>
<p>people come in and buy at a faster pace, you know, everyone</p>
<p>and so this is a market dynamic. It&rsquo;s not like people are</p>
<p>physically hoarding loaves of bread, but commodity traders,</p>
<p>countries, strategic reserves, they start buying up what they</p>
<p>can get to prepare for the famine that&rsquo;s coming, then</p>
<p>prices go even higher. And then it kicks other people out of the</p>
<p>market that couldn&rsquo;t afford to buy it. And the whole thing</p>
<p>gets really ugly, really,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no off ramp here. There&rsquo;s no way to solve this.</p>
<p>Well, what freeberg Yeah, the thing I want to ask you is if we</p>
<p>had a peace deal right now a ceasefire, would we avoid this</p>
<p>outcome? I mean, like, how long? How long do we have to</p>
<p>Russia to reopen fertilizer export markets? Now? We need</p>
<p>natural gas prices to come down now. And we need them to plant</p>
<p>the spring wheat. Those are three things that need to happen</p>
<p>to solve this problem. If those three things don&rsquo;t happen, we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going into spring right now. So around the world in the northern</p>
<p>hemisphere, farmers are making plans, they&rsquo;re planting, they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>deciding how much fertilizer to use. And so as this market</p>
<p>starts to kind of work itself out over the next few months, a</p>
<p>lot of the commodity traders and the the ag departments, they</p>
<p>publish these planting reports, and they talk about how many</p>
<p>acres of what were planted, and then everyone forecast how much</p>
<p>the supply will be. And we&rsquo;re going to start to see these</p>
<p>uglier numbers come out over the next few weeks and months.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, we&rsquo;re seeing supplies dwindle, and Russia&rsquo;s holding</p>
<p>all this stuff. So you know, they&rsquo;re holding hostage</p>
<p>phosphorus, potassium, and the natural gas pricing is just what</p>
<p>it is. Remember, there are ammonia plants everywhere. There</p>
<p>are ammonia plants and I and all ammonia plants use natural gas</p>
<p>to create, you know, to create this nitrogen based ammonia.</p>
<p>Let me make a statement and I&rsquo;d love your reaction.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re finding out all of these externalities that was made with</p>
<p>underlying poor scientific rack reasoning that has caused these</p>
<p>issues to be exacerbated. So we know, for example, that our</p>
<p>overreliance on Russian hydrocarbons could have been</p>
<p>mitigated with nuclear, but we fell for shoddy science and we</p>
<p>fell for a bunch of uninformed people who ran this banner of</p>
<p>like, environmental protection, right? So they screwed us. Okay.</p>
<p>And those people now have meaningfully less credibility.</p>
<p>Let me give you another cohort. freeberg and you tell me all the</p>
<p>people that pushed back on GMO and said GMO was unacceptable.</p>
<p>It could never happen. It has to be x, y and z way. And there</p>
<p>are ways where we could have been working on plants that had</p>
<p>different mechanisms of action in order to actually absorb and</p>
<p>retain nutrients from the soil in different ways that would have</p>
<p>made us less reliant in exactly the way in which fertilizer</p>
<p>works. True or false? Yeah, GMO technology as a former Monsanto</p>
<p>executives, you can call me a Monsanto shill here. But yeah,</p>
<p>GMO technology has been hindered globally by a challenge</p>
<p>to adopt it. And there are techniques and technologies that</p>
<p>have not been aggressively developed, because of the</p>
<p>concern on approvals, just to get a single GMO trade approved</p>
<p>in the United States today and get it to market can take seven</p>
<p>to 13 years. And even then you have to still go get China to</p>
<p>approve it because they&rsquo;re the biggest importer. And you have</p>
<p>to, you know, get all these other market participants to</p>
<p>approve it. And there are multiple agencies to get to</p>
<p>approve it. Europe is finally the EU is finally coming back</p>
<p>to the GMO problem and saying, you know what precision gene</p>
<p>editing can actually be beneficial to growing better</p>
<p>more stuff. Now, would it have solved this particular crisis?</p>
<p>Can I just say what&rsquo;s so ridiculous about this? The fact</p>
<p>that we have a modern agrarian economy is because we actually</p>
<p>did figure out a way to do GMO except we use the Punnett</p>
<p>square and we use successive iterations. But the minute that</p>
<p>you try to scientifically scale it in a lab, all of a sudden,</p>
<p>that same process is not does not make any sense to me. That&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just intellectually so inconsistent.</p>
<p>Yeah, the thing that really scares people about GMO, like,</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;ve spent a lot of time on GMOs. And the reason people</p>
<p>are upset, I have a broader philosophical point.</p>
<p>Believe in that do you believe in that inconsistency, that</p>
<p>intellectual inconsistency? Like, how do you think somebody</p>
<p>from, you know, pre BC to today, I think that</p>
<p>agriculture iterated on our</p>
<p>Yes, no, I think agriculture itself is technology. Think</p>
<p>about it. Humans, humans used to go out and just eat whatever</p>
<p>was lying around what nature gave us. Then we started making</p>
<p>rows in the ground and putting seeds in the ground and putting</p>
<p>water on the ground. We engineered the earth to make</p>
<p>that we started to bring</p>
<p>and then we did plant breeding and traditional plant breeding</p>
<p>through Norman Norman Norman save the world that</p>
<p>genetically modifying things it is and then what we did with</p>
<p>GMOs, which is the distinction just to be really clear about</p>
<p>the definitional distinction between GMO and traditional</p>
<p>plant breeding. GMO is when you take DNA from another organism,</p>
<p>and you put it in the plant&rsquo;s DNA to get that plant to do</p>
<p>something very specific. And Jason, you came with me to</p>
<p>Monsanto. I mean, you should be cautious, we should be cautious</p>
<p>about anytime we&rsquo;re doing stuff like that. Right. But</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s generally like a very visceral reaction when I</p>
<p>make that statement. And people are like, wait, you&rsquo;re taking</p>
<p>the DNA from bacteria and putting it in plants. And how</p>
<p>do I know that&rsquo;s going to work? And so there&rsquo;s these layers of</p>
<p>concern, which, you know, are deeply psychological layers, but</p>
<p>we can, you know, scientifically resolve this over time. But</p>
<p>look, at the end of the day, humans today, you guys remember</p>
<p>last year, how much I was talking about that starch</p>
<p>synthesis paper, and how important it was, we don&rsquo;t need</p>
<p>to grow plants to make the stuff we need to consume. If every</p>
<p>city around the world had a starch synthesizer, and it took</p>
<p>co2 from the atmosphere and water from the ocean, and had</p>
<p>this technique developed out, it could synthesize its own</p>
<p>calories in a physical device without needing to rely on the</p>
<p>ammonia supply chain and the phosphate supply chain, and all</p>
<p>of the systems that we rely on that are super outdated, that</p>
<p>are all a scaled up industrialized version of old</p>
<p>school agrarian techniques. Humans today, I think have the</p>
<p>ability to synthesize and print food. And over the next couple</p>
<p>of decades, particularly catalyzed by what&rsquo;s going on in</p>
<p>Russia, Ukraine today, we&rsquo;re going to see these technologies</p>
<p>accelerate. It&rsquo;s obviously where I spent a lot of my time, but</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m super excited about it. Yeah,</p>
<p>I think we suffer from a very insidious kind of plague in the</p>
<p>world, which is the plague of overeducated dumb people. And</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s almost as if, you know, because of their degree</p>
<p>and the school, you give them inordinate power to make value</p>
<p>judgments that really put the world in a very difficult</p>
<p>position. And so when you have something like a war in Ukraine,</p>
<p>it just lays everything bare. And you find, you find all these</p>
<p>things like, you know, simple another, another version of this</p>
<p>example, how did an entire continent and specifically, I</p>
<p>mean, Europe, abdicate their entire energy security to the</p>
<p>group of it to a group of environmentalists and to, you</p>
<p>know, to a 16 year old girl, without even thinking about what</p>
<p>the right answer was for themselves from first</p>
<p>principles. That&rsquo;s really crazy that that happened. And you need</p>
<p>a war, you know, where 10s of 1000s of people have to die to</p>
<p>realize that that was a really bad set of decisions that have</p>
<p>been compounding for decades. Here&rsquo;s another example where</p>
<p>food security is yet another one where, you know, we weren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>able to think cleanly from first principles. And so depending on</p>
<p>who had more money, or who was able to create more psychological</p>
<p>guilt, or fear, was able to get an outcome that fundamentally</p>
<p>puts the world at 100 million person plus famine. So somehow</p>
<p>we need to rethink how our institutions work, because we</p>
<p>are giving folks who haven&rsquo;t proved that they can handle</p>
<p>power, the ability to influence outcomes, for the wrong sets of</p>
<p>reasons.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s even worse tomorrow, these people you&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>who are smart, dumb people, they&rsquo;re so privileged that</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re living in some bubble making decisions for people who</p>
<p>have food insecurity, or energy insecurity. And it&rsquo;s only when</p>
<p>COVID showed, hey, oh, semiconductors, I can&rsquo;t get my</p>
<p>car that I want, because it doesn&rsquo;t have the chip in it. Or</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t get drugs, or I can&rsquo;t get PPE, then all of a sudden,</p>
<p>they see the value and redundancy and supply chain. But</p>
<p>when they were living high on the hog, and had nothing to</p>
<p>worry about, and 20 different flavors of Captain Crunch, that</p>
<p>you know, they can&rsquo;t even think about people in Africa.</p>
<p>Jacob, I think it&rsquo;s really important to speak to the</p>
<p>capitalist incentive and how you get there. So okay, we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>globalized supply chains, because as a business, it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t make sense for me to do every step of the thing that I</p>
<p>want to do, because you can get better utilization out of capex</p>
<p>if a system is running all the time to make stuff. So if one</p>
<p>step of the system doesn&rsquo;t need the other system running 24 seven,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to outsource that. And that&rsquo;s kind of think about</p>
<p>like semiconductors, think about food manufacturing, right doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>make sense for a farmer today to make his own ammonia. So</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an ammonia plant that centrally makes that stuff 24</p>
<p>seven distributes it out to a bunch of farmers that brings the</p>
<p>cost down per unit of production. And so these</p>
<p>systems have existed because we&rsquo;ve had less capital with a</p>
<p>higher ROI on capital invested at every point in the system by</p>
<p>you know, distributing and having a kind of, you know,</p>
<p>centralized supply chain system like this. Now, what we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>looking at today is what happens when one part of that system</p>
<p>fails. And now I think the big trend for the next decade or two,</p>
<p>everyone&rsquo;s going to have like a institutional memory of this. And</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to see companies that are going to start to</p>
<p>vertically integrate supply chains, they&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>vertically integrate their, their manufacturing, we&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to see a lot of businesses make what traditionally would have</p>
<p>been really, quote unquote, bad capex decisions and bad</p>
<p>investment decisions. And they&rsquo;re gonna say, you know what</p>
<p>we need to have redundancy because we cannot face the</p>
<p>cataclysmic kind of circumstance that we faced in the past.</p>
<p>I also think those are, by the way, the easy decisions. I also</p>
<p>think that there are some more complicated ones of morality</p>
<p>that we may have also misappropriated. I&rsquo;ll give you</p>
<p>one example. So if you think about energy independence of</p>
<p>America, I think there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s not going to be there&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>going to be many who think that it&rsquo;s not critically important.</p>
<p>Well, then you go and say we have a short term bridge with</p>
<p>hydrocarbons and the long term solution is renewables. But</p>
<p>underneath renewables is the idea that you have to store</p>
<p>these things, right, you have to store the energy you make,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s from wind or solar, even if it&rsquo;s from nuclear,</p>
<p>okay. And all of that results in us needing batteries, while</p>
<p>batteries need lithium, there&rsquo;s enormous lithium deposits in the</p>
<p>United States that today can never get access because we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>decided that the you know, the upper land grouse of a state is</p>
<p>more important than America&rsquo;s energy independence, right? So</p>
<p>when push comes to shove, a small rat like creature is</p>
<p>prioritized more importantly than America&rsquo;s energy</p>
<p>independence. The downstream implications of that are now</p>
<p>obvious, rising costs, inflation, unemployment,</p>
<p>potential recession, war, death, famine, is the upper land</p>
<p>grouse that fundamentally more important than all of these</p>
<p>systemic risks to humankind. And the thing is, for a long</p>
<p>time, we would never even think about the trade offs to</p>
<p>actually think about why that decision should be made that</p>
<p>way. And now we actually have the ability to remake these</p>
<p>decisions. So it&rsquo;s going to be really interesting to see</p>
<p>whether we upend all of these existing frameworks, you know,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s enormous environmental lobbies that have</p>
<p>been created that have raised hundreds of millions, billions</p>
<p>of dollars to fight these battles systematically wherever</p>
<p>they come up. And in some ways, now what people will say, well,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve really prevented progress, and you&rsquo;ve actually</p>
<p>done more damage. That&rsquo;s going to be a really interesting point</p>
<p>in our good intent evolution, good intent, save the</p>
<p>environment. And then there are downstream impacts. Let&rsquo;s go to</p>
<p>sacks about the sanctions, we saw a level of sanctions we</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t expect. They were ferocious, they were unilateral,</p>
<p>they they they&rsquo;re, you know, undeniably having an impact. Do</p>
<p>you think Putin would be at the table? Do you think the</p>
<p>sanctions are really having a dramatic impact? And do you</p>
<p>think that there&rsquo;ll be a tool that we should use in the</p>
<p>future? Or do you think maybe we need to be more thoughtful</p>
<p>about them? In other words, cancel culture comes up as a</p>
<p>an analogy here, people are saying, oh, it&rsquo;s like cancel</p>
<p>culture for a country. I think it&rsquo;s pretty great that a country</p>
<p>that is murdering their neighbors doesn&rsquo;t get to</p>
<p>participate. But obviously, you can have some serious concerns</p>
<p>if fertilizer and supply chain issues, as we just discussed,</p>
<p>are going to cause famine. So what&rsquo;s the balance here?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think it&rsquo;s a great another great example of, you</p>
<p>know, we&rsquo;re not thinking through the second and third order</p>
<p>consequences of what we&rsquo;re doing, we&rsquo;re just reacting. And</p>
<p>so to Friedberg&rsquo;s point, so, you know, first of all, we have to</p>
<p>realize this was more than just sanctions, this was a complete</p>
<p>severing of economic ties. I mean, basically, every Western</p>
<p>country pulled up stakes out of Russia. They and they did it on</p>
<p>their own, too. I mean, they did it because for the reasons you</p>
<p>said, because they wanted to make a statement that what</p>
<p>Putin did was wrong. So every Russian who was working for one</p>
<p>of these companies basically got fired and all the stores</p>
<p>closed, and so on. So I think I think it is, the repercussions</p>
<p>of it are going to be severe. However, these things, the</p>
<p>economics of it take time to play out. And so do I think it</p>
<p>creates pressure on Putin to make a deal? Yes. But, you know,</p>
<p>if the if this is going to be determined on the battlefield</p>
<p>one way or another in the next month, do I think it has time to</p>
<p>operate in that timeframe? Probably not. And I think what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>likely to happen here is that in the same way that the real</p>
<p>repercussions of this war are going to be felt in grain</p>
<p>production in six months, you know, there is an economic</p>
<p>tsunami headed for our own economy as a result of the</p>
<p>blowback from basically severing, you know, 144 million</p>
<p>Russians from the global economy. There&rsquo;s also going to</p>
<p>be geopolitical blowback. I mean, you know, I think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>very likely that the way this is going to play out</p>
<p>geopolitically is that Russia will become a Chinese client.</p>
<p>And, you know, all of those natural resources that China</p>
<p>produces, the gas, you know, all the the mineral wealth, that</p>
<p>those resources are going to flow on a conveyor belt on a</p>
<p>belt and road conveyor belt from Moscow to Beijing, and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to fuel the Chinese economy.</p>
<p>Yeah, yes and no, because the reality is, the thing we have</p>
<p>to remember is China is still a fundamentally export driven</p>
<p>economy, of which 35% just alone goes to the United States,</p>
<p>when you add in Europe and other OECD countries, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>almost 60%. So I think the idea that all of a sudden you,</p>
<p>Russia will be able to backdoor all of these things through</p>
<p>China into the rest of the world, I think is not really</p>
<p>realistic. And this is actually why I think the rhetoric is so</p>
<p>high. Because those two countries specifically are put</p>
<p>in a very difficult situation. Like what do you think the</p>
<p>China calculus on Taiwan is looking what&rsquo;s happening to</p>
<p>Russia? Has it completely? It&rsquo;s completely off the table,</p>
<p>completely off the table, they would never consider invading</p>
<p>Taiwan, Taiwan, knowing that it would put Apple in a position</p>
<p>or other companies that are entwined in the Chinese economy.</p>
<p>I think they would have to, again, I&rsquo;ve said this before,</p>
<p>everybody has was always, you know, sort of like lambasting</p>
<p>economic sanctions, you know, even on this pod, people, it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>never going to work, it doesn&rsquo;t do anything. And it turns out</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just not true.</p>
<p>To be clear, I think sanctions are an appropriate way to create</p>
<p>economic pressure so that we can get a ceasefire and a peace</p>
<p>deal made. Okay. So I do believe in the same way that I believe</p>
<p>we should arm the Ukrainians so they can defend themselves</p>
<p>while I&rsquo;m against a no fly zone. The issue is just are we</p>
<p>actually using the leverage that we&rsquo;re creating to drive this</p>
<p>process to a success? I&rsquo;m talking to the ceasefire process</p>
<p>to a successful resolution. Because if we just make this the</p>
<p>new normal, which is, you know, a, basically an insurrection</p>
<p>in Ukraine that drags on forever, and that China and</p>
<p>Russia cut off from the global economy and becomes a client of</p>
<p>China. I think there&rsquo;s a parade of horribles that flow from</p>
<p>that. And Freebird just outlined one of them, which is</p>
<p>hundreds of millions of people across the world potentially</p>
<p>starving. So my point about sanctions is not that we</p>
<p>shouldn&rsquo;t have done them, but there are going to be big</p>
<p>repercussions for our economy if we don&rsquo;t resolve the</p>
<p>situation in Ukraine. Let&rsquo;s do best case worst case with these</p>
<p>new this new economic order here and economic sanction</p>
<p>ability that the West has now demonstrated, you know, quite</p>
<p>effectively. For me, the best case scenario here is, if you</p>
<p>want to participate in the global economy and globalism to</p>
<p>global globalization 2.0 means you&rsquo;re going to have to be hit</p>
<p>some base behavior level of being a good actor in the world</p>
<p>if you want to participate in the wider economy. Therefore,</p>
<p>as Chamath just pointed out, I think quite correctly, Taiwan&rsquo;s</p>
<p>off the table. I mean, China does already is having massive</p>
<p>economic downturn and headwinds. The idea that they would face</p>
<p>what Russia is facing right now in terms of sanctions globally</p>
<p>would be cataclysmic for them. So do we think what&rsquo;s the what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the best case in your mind, Friedberg, the worst case of</p>
<p>this new economic sanctions that we&rsquo;ve just outlined best case</p>
<p>worst case, much of this is driven by Russian decision</p>
<p>making, not just our decision making. And so you know, there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a lot of question marks around what they&rsquo;re gonna they&rsquo;ve said,</p>
<p>definitively, we are banning all fertilizer exports through</p>
<ol start="2022">
<li>Okay, so like, does changing a sanction model at</li>
</ol>
<p>this point, get enough resolve for them to kind of come back to</p>
<p>the table? Do we need to kind of weave that into some discussion</p>
<p>peace discussion that they&rsquo;re having with Ukraine, I think</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s going to need to be this multilateral, like global,</p>
<p>either support or partnership model, that&rsquo;s going to have to</p>
<p>kind of emerge for this to all get resolved positively. I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think that it&rsquo;s just about Russia and Ukraine agreeing to a</p>
<p>bunch of terms, we&rsquo;re all going to be affected by what&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>on and what Russia has chosen to do back to us. And we all</p>
<p>think we&rsquo;re in the power and we&rsquo;ve blocked them and destroyed</p>
<p>the ruble and, you know, knock them back to the Stone Age,</p>
<p>yada, yada, but like, we&rsquo;re hurting ourselves far more than</p>
<p>we realize. And we have to go get something back from Russia in</p>
<p>order to resolve this. So nuanced, I&rsquo;m not sure I totally</p>
<p>agree with that. I actually think that, you know, necessity,</p>
<p>what is it? Necessity is the mother of invention. I think</p>
<p>that this has the ability just circling back to what we said</p>
<p>before, for us to rewrite all of these other decisions that</p>
<p>were frankly, not necessarily rooted in either first</p>
<p>principles or long strategic thought, in a way that can</p>
<p>actually improve the state of play for everybody, not just</p>
<p>including us for the next 50 or 100 years. So I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>completely convinced that it&rsquo;s as catastrophically bad as you</p>
<p>think. Well, what about this, Friedberg, if we were thinking</p>
<p>about food stability, you mentioned your slurry, and, you</p>
<p>know, being able to make these calories without actually</p>
<p>planting any food. If we go anywhere, if you call it a</p>
<p>slurry, but yeah, okay, let&rsquo;s call it a protein bar. You know,</p>
<p>like, like, ultimately, Jason, we can actually create pasta,</p>
<p>bread, rice. I mean, that&rsquo;s where this all goes. Perfect. By</p>
<p>the way, just so you guys know, I want to frame this up. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>super important. 60% of the world&rsquo;s calories come from</p>
<p>carbohydrates, which are basically two molecules, amylose</p>
<p>and amylopectin. Okay, that&rsquo;s what makes up starch. So if we</p>
<p>can synthesize amylose and amylopectin, we can make it</p>
<p>would it take how long would it take? What would it cost to</p>
<p>build your pasta making machine and rice making machine, you</p>
<p>know, to have more decades long scale up problems, right? This</p>
<p>is not like this is like, hey, we got a solar similar to</p>
<p>nuclear or solar and batteries. Yeah, yeah. Okay. But there are</p>
<p>solutions to this. I look I mean, this is why I keep coming</p>
<p>back to saying like, we&rsquo;re evolving the global economy and</p>
<p>planet Earth away from this model of centralized industrial</p>
<p>manufacturing into a production system that looks more</p>
<p>distributed, more decentralized with better technology. And</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s really a big trend for the century for for our</p>
<p>global economy. And that&rsquo;s why right now I think the near term</p>
<p>trend is in de globalization, people making less capital</p>
<p>efficient decisions that create redundancy and supply chains.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a lot of ways as investors to play that, by the</p>
<p>way. Saks, what are your thoughts on maybe the the high</p>
<p>order a bit for the West being a race to resiliency or a race</p>
<p>to redundancy in energy in semiconductors, this race to</p>
<p>resiliency in food supply? Yeah, I mean, look, trade creates</p>
<p>economic wealth, but it also creates dependency. And we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>realizing the downsides of having that dependency if we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>dependent on or Europe is dependent on Russian cast, or</p>
<p>you know, you saw during COVID, we&rsquo;ve become dependent on</p>
<p>Chinese pharmaceuticals, all the pharma companies have moved</p>
<p>their manufacturing over there. And then you know, that got</p>
<p>when China was rattling the saber, because we were blaming</p>
<p>them for COVID. This was back in 2020. They all of a sudden</p>
<p>started implying we might not get access to pharmaceuticals.</p>
<p>So look, we are gonna have to rethink all those trade</p>
<p>relationships. You can&rsquo;t have trade without trust. Because,</p>
<p>again, if you if you you are empowering the producer to cut</p>
<p>you off when you make yourself dependent on that. Yeah. So So</p>
<p>look, I think we&rsquo;re gonna have to rethink all of that. But can</p>
<p>I go back to your best case worst case question? Yes, I was</p>
<p>trying to get somebody in there. I think it&rsquo;s a good</p>
<p>question. And, you know, here, let me lay out the best case</p>
<p>and then the worst. So the best case, look, the best case is</p>
<p>this sort of the Fukuyama argument, the sort of the from</p>
<p>argument is this Western triumphalism, which is like</p>
<p>sanctions are going to drive the Russians into submission,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going to topple Putin, the people are going to rise up,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re going to lose this war, we are going to strike a great</p>
<p>blow against autocracy, and liberal democracy is going to</p>
<p>win. Okay, I understand that argument. Okay, now, what&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>the worst case scenario? Worst case scenario is Freiburg&rsquo;s</p>
<p>right, we end up with hundreds of millions of people starving,</p>
<p>the war drags on because Russians are going to give up.</p>
<p>So the sanctions, you know, while be while hurting the</p>
<p>Russians don&rsquo;t end the war, and in fact, drive them into the</p>
<p>arms of the Chinese, you know, the rush has been called a big</p>
<p>gas station with nukes, that gas station will now fill up the</p>
<p>Chinese economy, henceforth, worsening the balance of power</p>
<p>in Cold War Two. And then there&rsquo;s a big, you know, tsunami</p>
<p>or boomerang headed for the US economy. And we we have a</p>
<p>recession later this year, as gas prices go to $7 and $10 a</p>
<p>gallon. And so it ends up hurting us. And so I don&rsquo;t, I</p>
<p>certainly see the case for sanctions. But, but I wonder if</p>
<p>people are really thinking through the downside scenarios.</p>
<p>And what I what I do think is that if that that the removal of</p>
<p>sanctions should be certainly something we&rsquo;re affirmatively</p>
<p>putting on the table in these ceasefire negotiations, and that</p>
<p>sounds obvious, but I saw a tweet from Ian Bremmer, who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>sort of part of the foreign policy establishment guy, think</p>
<p>tank guy, who has been pretty good on like, smart, he&rsquo;s smart.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s been good on no fly zone. He&rsquo;s been saying the same</p>
<p>things I&rsquo;ve been saying, like, guys, this is tantamount to a</p>
<p>declaration of war, we&rsquo;re not going there. Also, basically</p>
<p>saying that, listen, no matter what the Russians do, we&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>going to get into war three here. He&rsquo;s been cool headed</p>
<p>about that. But he also tweeted that, listen, as long as Putin&rsquo;s</p>
<p>in control of Russia, we can&rsquo;t ever do business with them</p>
<p>again, sanctions are sticking around basically forever. And I</p>
<p>just wonder if that is an overreaction, if we&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>make that policy, I&rsquo;d rather see us as America be willing to put</p>
<p>economic relations back on the table, as you know, in this</p>
<p>peace process, as opposed to saying, the Russians are cut off</p>
<p>forever. Because otherwise, they&rsquo;re just going to become a</p>
<p>Chinese client state. I don&rsquo;t see how that benefits us long</p>
<p>term. Well, again, I did. But again, David, what do you think</p>
<p>they do with China, China? What are they going to do, take 60%</p>
<p>of their goods and still export them to us, even though it just</p>
<p>contains Russian materials that are now considered contraband?</p>
<p>So they can&rsquo;t absorb it economically, as my point,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s not enough demand outside these OECD countries to</p>
<p>absorb all of that. Well, here&rsquo;s what I think. It&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>mathematically not possible. I think so like, I think you make</p>
<p>a point. But I think if you&rsquo;re going to look at this from like</p>
<p>a 50,000 foot level, I think there&rsquo;s like two grand</p>
<p>narratives about what is happening in the world. One</p>
<p>narrative, sort of the neocon, sort of liberal hegemony</p>
<p>narrative is that we&rsquo;re in a great battle between democracy</p>
<p>and autocracy. The other narrative is that we&rsquo;re in Cold</p>
<p>War Two is that it&rsquo;s more of a great power rivalry between the</p>
<p>US and China. I tend to think that the latter is where we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>really at in the world. And the reason why I say that is, you</p>
<p>look at there&rsquo;s a lot of autocracies who frankly, we</p>
<p>support because we want them on our side. For example, you know,</p>
<p>Turkey is run by an autocrat. You know, Erdogan is becoming</p>
<p>more autocratic. In Egypt, we had sort of democracy there for</p>
<p>a brief moment. When Mubarak got overthrown, guess what, they</p>
<p>elected the Muslim Brotherhood. And we didn&rsquo;t like that too</p>
<p>much. And now we got General al-Sisi in charge. We like that</p>
<p>a lot better. You know, we are still allies with the Saudis,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re a more autocratic government. And so I tend to</p>
<p>think that, you know, the better way to describe what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>happening in the world is a balance of power rivalry between</p>
<p>the US and China, which is only going to pick up momentum in</p>
<p>the current in the coming decades. And we have to think</p>
<p>about who&rsquo;s on our side of the ledger, and who&rsquo;s on their side</p>
<p>of the ledger. And, you know, I think, at this point, it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve pretty much driven Russia completely onto the Chinese</p>
<p>side of the ledger. And I think it&rsquo;s gonna have like very bad</p>
<p>consequences for us.</p>
<p>All right, let&rsquo;s segue from here into the economy,</p>
<p>inflation, and markets. In a previous episode, Chamath, you</p>
<p>talked about the psychological cycle of, you know, ignoring</p>
<p>good news, then accepting it being outraged by it, and then</p>
<p>maybe not taking the good news. In the bad news column,</p>
<p>obviously, inflation continues last six months of CPI numbers</p>
<p>year over year, obviously, September 5.4, I&rsquo;ll fast forward</p>
<p>to November 6.8, January 7.5, February 7.9, excluding food and</p>
<p>energy, core inflation still rose 6.4%. That being said, we</p>
<p>have 11 point x million jobs available for Americans, five or</p>
<p>6 million people unemployed who are looking for work, obviously,</p>
<p>there will be some mismatch in terms of geography and skills</p>
<p>there. And then corporate earnings great, but a recession</p>
<p>possibly looming. Where are you on this? And obviously, the</p>
<p>markets bottomed out. So where are you at with the economy,</p>
<p>hope, fear, and otherwise?</p>
<p>Well, I think that we&rsquo;re in the midst of what I would call a</p>
<p>melt up. So, you know, probably the next month, month and a</p>
<p>half, there really isn&rsquo;t much, quote, unquote, bad news that</p>
<p>hasn&rsquo;t been priced in. The thing that I&rsquo;ve learned over the last</p>
<p>few years is that markets don&rsquo;t actually care what the news is.</p>
<p>They, they can process good news and bad news equally well, what</p>
<p>they despise is the uncertainty of what the news could be. And</p>
<p>so this week was really important because we had two</p>
<p>huge buckets of uncertainty taken out of the market. So the</p>
<p>one we&rsquo;ve already talked about, which is when, when the market</p>
<p>saw that there was a surface area of a deal between Ukraine</p>
<p>and Russia, that was really constructive. Because neither</p>
<p>side would have signaled something if both parties were</p>
<p>very far apart. So that that meant to the markets were a few</p>
<p>weeks out from something getting done. And then the second thing</p>
<p>was Jerome Powell and the Federal Reserve. They finally</p>
<p>had their meeting, they raised rates 25 basis points. But even</p>
<p>more importantly, they gave you a very prescriptive forecast of</p>
<p>what the next year will look like at a minimum, and possibly</p>
<p>even two years. And once you could have that, you were able</p>
<p>to then go and redo all of your expectations. And what people</p>
<p>realized was, okay, you know, inflation may actually start to</p>
<p>get tamed in the back half of the year, the economy is still</p>
<p>quite strong. And we could actually support two, two and a</p>
<p>half percent interest rates, and still actually grow really well.</p>
<p>And so what you&rsquo;ve seen in the last three or four days is a</p>
<p>reaction to the loss of uncertainty. And so there really</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t now the only thing to find the ointment could be if the war</p>
<p>all of a sudden escalates, not that it gets dragged on, because</p>
<p>at that point, that&rsquo;s also I think, been priced in. But if</p>
<p>something very meaningfully different, and some and Russia,</p>
<p>in this case, ratchets up the intensity by going, you know,</p>
<p>nuclear or something else, although I think that&rsquo;s a very</p>
<p>long tail chemical weapons seems a possibility, or</p>
<p>corporate bombing, I think these are all very, very low</p>
<p>probability events. But in the absence of these things, you</p>
<p>basically have really constructive dynamics right now</p>
<p>for at least the next month and a half, maybe even two months.</p>
<p>How much of this has to do with retail investors who were YOLO</p>
<p>hodlers, speculators, stimmy checks, getting super active for</p>
<p>two years, and then maybe getting super spooked right now</p>
<p>and maybe needing the money to deploy in their lives.</p>
<p>Look, the thing to remember, and I hate to be this blunt, but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s true. Retail is not a very good signal of anything. In</p>
<p>fact, if you actually look at retail flows, typically, you</p>
<p>will make money by doing the exact opposite of what retail</p>
<p>does. And I posted this in the group chat to you guys, you</p>
<p>know, every single day of since the beginning of this year,</p>
<p>retail was a net buyer. In all of those days, the market got</p>
<p>punched in the face. Finally, at the beginning of March, retail</p>
<p>capitulated. Right. And I posted that same day. And I said,</p>
<p>guys, this is the moment to buy. And it lo and behold, what</p>
<p>happened, the markets rallied meaningfully from that point.</p>
<p>And the reason is because they were going into the end of q1,</p>
<p>you have a huge tax bill due in April 15. People were starting</p>
<p>to just finally give up, they were buying every single day,</p>
<p>and they finally gave up. But that capitulation was the</p>
<p>moment that you buy. So if anything, retail is is is the</p>
<p>you know, you know, I&rsquo;ve said before, you fade your faith</p>
<p>list, you know, retail flows are something you typically will</p>
<p>make money by fading by doing the exact opposite of whatever</p>
<p>retail is doing. And you just need to have access to that</p>
<p>information. If you have access to it, you can kind of, you</p>
<p>know, profit from it. So where are we going from here probably</p>
<p>up, David, you&rsquo;ve been pessimistic. We&rsquo;re seeing a lot</p>
<p>of changes in the private market, funding rounds taking</p>
<p>longer, a lot of funds getting closed, you know, venture funds,</p>
<p>that is, but seems like a lot more diligence is being done.</p>
<p>The time meantime to closing a deal has definitely extended</p>
<p>massively. What&rsquo;s your betting strategy now as a venture</p>
<p>capitalist,</p>
<p>I think that there&rsquo;s going to be a trickle down effect of what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>happened in the market to privates and the valuations are</p>
<p>going to go back to their pre COVID levels. I mean, they are</p>
<p>multiples pre COVID. We&rsquo;re like 20, not 100. So we&rsquo;re seeing a</p>
<p>massive repricing of deals. And that&rsquo;s going to continue. And I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s going to be this like transient effect,</p>
<p>everything&rsquo;s going to bounce back in a few weeks. On the</p>
<p>public markets, the defining characteristic of these markets</p>
<p>is volatility. I mean, the VIX, which is the measure of</p>
<p>volatility is at one of its all time highs. And so it&rsquo;s true</p>
<p>that over the past week, we saw a nice sort of melt up or rally.</p>
<p>Because there was speculation about this peace deal, the</p>
<p>Financial Times had that article in the 15 point plan. Chamath is</p>
<p>right that if that peace deal gets signed, I think the market</p>
<p>rally strongly because, you know, it went up considerably</p>
<p>just on hopes that it might be signed. But on the other hand,</p>
<p>if this peace process falls apart, I think the market will</p>
<p>give back all those gains and then some I think we are nowhere</p>
<p>near out of the woods on all the risky scenarios that could</p>
<p>develop from this war. I think that if there is no peace deal,</p>
<p>I think you can almost expect Russia to escalate in the war.</p>
<p>They have said this is an existential issue for them. I</p>
<p>think that would mean at a minimum, you know, heavy</p>
<p>bombing of Ukrainian cities, and then they&rsquo;ll step up the</p>
<p>pressure even more on Biden and Washington to get militarily</p>
<p>involved. This situation could still spin out of control. So,</p>
<p>you know, I think in the absence of peace deal, and then</p>
<p>finally, we have all the risks of recession, we definitely are</p>
<p>seeing a slowdown in the economy right now. And I think if this</p>
<p>war continues, and we don&rsquo;t get the spring planning and things</p>
<p>keep, you know, deteriorating, I think we&rsquo;re headed for a very</p>
<p>serious recession in this country, I think we&rsquo;ll go from</p>
<p>slowdown to recession. So if I were advising Biden, of course,</p>
<p>no one&rsquo;s listening to me. But if I were advising Biden, I would</p>
<p>be telling Biden, listen, Mr. President, we are going to have</p>
<p>a horrible midterms in November. And you know, we are</p>
<p>going to have a really hard time in 2024. If this war continues,</p>
<p>and, you know, we head down into recession, or any of the</p>
<p>other catastrophes that could happen, we need to push for a</p>
<p>peace deal right now. And the US should be playing a</p>
<p>constructive role. And we should be applying pressure</p>
<p>wherever we can to make a deal because the broad contours of</p>
<p>this deal to my point, have been set. I don&rsquo;t think any of the</p>
<p>details now that we know, look, it&rsquo;s about Crimea, it&rsquo;s about</p>
<p>Donbass about neutrality. None of the details that we&rsquo;re still</p>
<p>fighting over are more important than getting a piece right now.</p>
<p>And if I were in the White House, I&rsquo;d be singly pushing for</p>
<p>that. Yeah, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s complicated. There, the, the</p>
<p>counter to that, obviously, is, this could be, you know, the</p>
<p>beginning of the end for Putin. And, you know, even if that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>10% chance or 20% chance, the possibility that in our</p>
<p>lifetime, you know, Russia could have a leadership change</p>
<p>could be tremendous, obviously, it&rsquo;s a coin toss, which way it</p>
<p>goes. But change could be</p>
<p>so look, that&rsquo;s certainly in the cards. And, and look, if</p>
<p>somehow magically Putin got toppled and replaced with a</p>
<p>democrat, that would be a wonderful thing. However,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s happened before. It&rsquo;s rare, but it happens. Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, tell me when it when does it happen?</p>
<p>East Germany, right? We tore down the wall.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, that was a reunification. Here&rsquo;s the basic</p>
<p>problem is, we understand the Russians in the Russian system,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got all these oligarchs are basically like bosses or</p>
<p>mob bosses. And then Putin&rsquo;s like the boss of bosses, right?</p>
<p>So what are the odds if you take out the boss of bosses, that</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s replaced with someone who&rsquo;s a democrat versus the next</p>
<p>biggest, baddest boss? I think, you know, look, that that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>certainly a possibility. But my concern is that when you play</p>
<p>from maximalist upside like that, you&rsquo;re also taking</p>
<p>maximalist downside. And a lot of people have made this point</p>
<p>that look, if Putin&rsquo;s life is on the line, he&rsquo;s gonna be more</p>
<p>willing to do anything. And I think the the better approach</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve you&rsquo;ve heard people mentioned this idea of the</p>
<p>golden bridge from Sun Tzu, which is give your enemy a</p>
<p>golden bridge to retreat mentioned it so that he&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>fighting for his life.</p>
<p>That was a really clever framework, Jacob, I think. I</p>
<p>mean, if you guys went and created a tally, and I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>trying to be Debbie down here. But, you know, since the advent</p>
<p>of the CIA, the number of times that we have tried to incite</p>
<p>regime change, and then the number of times it&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>successful, what is that percentage? I mean, we don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know, because we don&rsquo;t know how many times we&rsquo;ve tried. Well,</p>
<p>we know we know many attempts. And I mean, we&rsquo;ve changed a lot</p>
<p>of two outers. We&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>every time we try it, we either get the same or worse. So for</p>
<p>example, Syria, we tried to get rid of Assad, he&rsquo;s still there.</p>
<p>And now it&rsquo;s worse. Afghanistan, we tried it, the</p>
<p>Taliban are back in power. Well, no, but</p>
<p>take it to the calculation is what if it does change?</p>
<p>Hold on Iraq, we got rid of Saddam. And now we&rsquo;ve handed</p>
<p>that country to Iran on a silver platter, the ayatollahs control</p>
<p>it. Qaddafi in Libya, we got rid of him because he was so</p>
<p>horrible. And now that country is in chaos. You&rsquo;ve got</p>
<p>open air slave markets. We tried in. In Ukraine, we tried</p>
<p>in Ukraine in 2014. So our track record is not super good.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, I mean, I think regime change is like chasing someone</p>
<p>out or something, you know, for a company at some point, we</p>
<p>would have been pipped for our ability to do regime change.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a great strategy. I&rsquo;m not necessarily</p>
<p>advocating for it. But what I&rsquo;m not saying that I&rsquo;m saying</p>
<p>whether or not it&rsquo;s a good strategy. I think that we are</p>
<p>particularly not good at it. Yeah, we need a performance</p>
<p>improvement plan on that front. We should just I think we should</p>
<p>just stop trying that we shouldn&rsquo;t be going for regime</p>
<p>change. We should be this is a good question. You and I had</p>
<p>this thing where I said you and I are in sync that we both want</p>
<p>to contain dictators, and maybe isolation and you&rsquo;re like, I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>not into isolation. So I think a definition of like, what is the</p>
<p>strategy for containment, going forward post a peace deal with</p>
<p>Russia. And isolationism, you know, I guess is a bit of a</p>
<p>trigger word is loaded. But well, yeah, I&rsquo;m not an</p>
<p>isolationist. Next person, I would describe my strategy as</p>
<p>selective engagement, meaning that we still engage</p>
<p>internationally on behalf of vital American interests in our</p>
<p>core interests, but we don&rsquo;t stick our fingers in the pie of</p>
<p>the internal affairs of all these countries all over the</p>
<p>world to try and foment regime change. So for example, like</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s an example of a vital American interest, I would say,</p>
<p>standing up to China in the sense that we do not want them</p>
<p>dominating Asia and becoming a peer competitor to the United</p>
<p>States that can then challenge us all over the world. So some</p>
<p>more pragmatist on it. And we can be isolationist with North</p>
<p>Korea, because there&rsquo;s literally nothing they can do for us.</p>
<p>And look, I would not be throwing countries like Turkey</p>
<p>and Egypt and Saudi Arabia out of our coalition in Cold War two</p>
<p>because we don&rsquo;t like the the nature of their governments. And</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying I support autocracy. I don&rsquo;t know. But the</p>
<p>reality is dialogue is reasonable, because if you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t, then the other side will, the foreign policy playbook is</p>
<p>going to get fundamentally rewritten. After this Russia,</p>
<p>Ukraine war, in large part because of the effectiveness of</p>
<p>government sanctions, plus corporate social responsibility,</p>
<p>whatever you want to call that CSR public sentiment, woke is</p>
<p>whatever you want to call it. Yes, I agree. But the</p>
<p>combination of these two things has proved to be incredibly</p>
<p>effective at setting the stage for some sort of compromise or</p>
<p>regime change, the spectrum of outcomes is there. But the point</p>
<p>is, that&rsquo;s an incredibly unique set of circumstances where</p>
<p>before we never would have thought an economy that large or</p>
<p>a country that important on the world stage, whatever have</p>
<p>compromised in the absence of military intervention. And I</p>
<p>think that that&rsquo;s important to think about as we think about</p>
<p>what our forward going China policy looks like, I think</p>
<p>really, like the the importance of like the OECD, right, the</p>
<p>importance of all these organized nations that consume</p>
<p>from China, becoming more organized now probably makes</p>
<p>more sense. I said this before in a tweet, but the importance</p>
<p>of the US dollar has become completely primary, which has</p>
<p>been an incredible benefit, you know, benefit of what has</p>
<p>happened because of this war, you know, very small silver</p>
<p>linings in the grand scheme of all this humanitarian crisis,</p>
<p>but those are going to be really important things that the</p>
<p>United States can seize on. So, you know, we may in some ways</p>
<p>have have had some diminished power in order to facilitate</p>
<p>peace in this, in this conflict. But the downstream capital that</p>
<p>we could accumulate by organizing these countries more</p>
<p>effectively, I think could be really important. And then</p>
<p>separately, we have to have a moral conversation in the</p>
<p>United States about all these things, like environmental laws,</p>
<p>like our approach to agriculture that may have been</p>
<p>under absolutely, yes, with faulty logic, a little more</p>
<p>pragmatism would go a long way.</p>
<p>Yes, it would. I&rsquo;m a little more pessimistic about our</p>
<p>foreign policy establishment. And part of the reason I say</p>
<p>this is because I&rsquo;m very disappointed in the Republicans,</p>
<p>the Republicans used to be the party, a vital national</p>
<p>interest, meaning America did not get involved all over the</p>
<p>world, unless we had a vital national interest. You just</p>
<p>never hear them making that case anymore. It&rsquo;s all the way</p>
<p>back to sort of Bush doctrine. And, you know, as an example,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re all pushing for the no fly zone, they&rsquo;re all pushing</p>
<p>for the delivery of the MIGs, despite they want war.</p>
<p>Just say the words.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re weird. I mean, those right wingers are crazy. Why</p>
<p>are they so war? I&rsquo;ve been very critical. I mean, I&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>war on this. I don&rsquo;t understand there. Well, I think there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>two possibilities.</p>
<p>Machoism.</p>
<p>Anxiety.</p>
<p>I think I think there&rsquo;s two possibilities. I think the</p>
<p>anxiety. Yeah. And this is why I predicted war at the end of</p>
<p>last year. But, you know, that turned out to be a great</p>
<p>prediction, right? Look, I&rsquo;ve been I&rsquo;ve been very</p>
<p>disappointed in the Republicans. And I think I think here&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what I think is going on. I think if any of those</p>
<p>Republicans, like, say, Mitt Romney or something, I look, I</p>
<p>think Lindsey Graham is just a crazy sort of warmonger. But,</p>
<p>but you take someone like Mitt Romney, who&rsquo;s basically saying</p>
<p>all of these sort of more bellicose and escalatory things.</p>
<p>If he was actually in Biden&rsquo;s shoes, I bet he&rsquo;d be making the</p>
<p>same decisions as Biden, because he would not want to risk war</p>
<p>three, but it&rsquo;s such a cheap, easy, partisan political attack</p>
<p>to say that Biden is being weak, and he&rsquo;s not doing everything</p>
<p>he can be weak at all. I think history will look back and think</p>
<p>two things about, about this whole thing with with the</p>
<p>American lens. The first thing was, for whatever set of</p>
<p>reasons, we lost it, then we diminish some stature in the</p>
<p>world, as a perceived arbitrator and mediator in</p>
<p>these kinds of conflicts. But separately, I do think Biden has</p>
<p>done a very good job in seeing the forest from the trees, he</p>
<p>held the line on military intervention, and he has really</p>
<p>ratcheted up the ability for others to impose economic</p>
<p>sanctions beside and behind the United States. And I think that</p>
<p>will turn out to be a masterstroke. I give him credit.</p>
<p>And I think that that he deserves to be acknowledged.</p>
<p>Because I think the Biden has done an amazing job of just</p>
<p>saying outright, we&rsquo;re not going to war, we are not</p>
<p>starting that takes a lot of courage, stop, that takes a lot</p>
<p>of courage. He has not even, I mean, in fact, you&rsquo;ve lauded</p>
<p>them. I think that shows some intellectual honesty on your</p>
<p>part. And to your point, you&rsquo;re not. There&rsquo;s a reason why we</p>
<p>lost our credibility. These misadventures, as Sachs calls</p>
<p>them in the Middle East have been disastrous. We made huge</p>
<p>mistakes. And we need to take a different approach. I&rsquo;ll give</p>
<p>Trump a compliment. He didn&rsquo;t start any wars. And if you look</p>
<p>at every president who came before him in our lifetime,</p>
<p>every time they start two or three conflicts, and he was</p>
<p>like, we&rsquo;re gonna have a no war policy. And now you got Biden</p>
<p>say, we&rsquo;re not going to go to war either. This could be a</p>
<p>tipping point. And our focus, I think the ultimate checkmate</p>
<p>should be Biden coming out and the EU coming on saying, we are</p>
<p>going to start a race to resiliency. And here&rsquo;s how it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to look, Jason, it&rsquo;s an incredible point that you just</p>
<p>made. I just want to reiterate it since Reagan, I can I can</p>
<p>explicitly point out incremental conflicts that the</p>
<p>President of the United States has approved and greenlit to</p>
<p>get us into since Reagan.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been in seven wars since the end of the Cold War. It&rsquo;s</p>
<p>amazing. The American people Trump was the only one that did</p>
<p>not start a new war for Biden. You want to know why? Because</p>
<p>he was a populist. And the people of the United States of</p>
<p>America don&rsquo;t want these crazy wars. They are sick of all these</p>
<p>wars. It is the foreign policy establishment that is pushing</p>
<p>for all of these wars. And listen, why and Obama the same</p>
<p>way Obama, let&rsquo;s go back. Obama beat Hillary Clinton for the</p>
<p>Democratic nomination, because he was against the Iraq War. And</p>
<p>she was for it. Yeah, Obama had the right instincts on Ukraine,</p>
<p>he did not want to escalate the situation. Remember, in 2014,</p>
<p>when they took Crimea, he said, America does not have a vital</p>
<p>national interest that justifies us going to war. He was right,</p>
<p>the president that tried to incite regime change. It&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>You want to know why? Because, because the State Department</p>
<p>lifers, you know, who instituted you incited that our</p>
<p>Undersecretary of State for Russian Affairs was Victoria</p>
<p>Newland, who was a foreign policy advisor for Dick Cheney.</p>
<p>And these people boll weevil their way into the foreign</p>
<p>policy establishment. They&rsquo;re in the think tanks during the</p>
<p>State Department. What did you just use boll weevil?</p>
<p>They are the permanent the hold on a second, they are the</p>
<p>permanent establishment of Washington, the president&rsquo;s</p>
<p>come and go, they stay forever. Yeah, she was there. She was</p>
<p>caught on a phone call, basically picking the new leader</p>
<p>of Ukraine after a coup in 2014. She is she the one that had</p>
<p>that famous quote that said, Putin, fuck Putin was that he</p>
<p>said he said, Yeah, she said, Yes, is our guy basically</p>
<p>picking yachts and yoke to be the new leader. And she said,</p>
<p>fuck the EU, when the EU wanted to take a more temperate</p>
<p>approach. Okay, okay, look at William F. Buckley. Here you</p>
<p>go. And sacks. I think the mistake Biden made. Listen, I</p>
<p>think Biden has good instincts on this. I think he had good</p>
<p>instincts last year in June, when he called for basically an</p>
<p>emergency summit with Putin to dial down the tensions. And I</p>
<p>think that summit was successful. So what happened?</p>
<p>Okay, the intercept just had a great article talking about how</p>
<p>tensions ratcheted down after that June summit, but they</p>
<p>picked back up in October, November, what happened between</p>
<p>June and October, I&rsquo;ll tell you what, on September 1, Zelensky</p>
<p>met with Biden in the White House, and the State Department</p>
<p>issued a joint statement, basically reaffirming that</p>
<p>Ukraine be part of NATO, it would reaffirm military ties,</p>
<p>economic ties. And then on November 10, they published a</p>
<p>giant charter agreement between the United States and Ukraine</p>
<p>that was signed by Blinken. Now look, did Biden know about</p>
<p>this? Yes, but this is the State Department agenda. And it</p>
<p>was on the heels of this charter agreement that the Russians</p>
<p>basically said they had reached the boiling point. They</p>
<p>basically delivered the ultimatum to the US in December</p>
<p>and precipitated the crisis that preceded this war. So my</p>
<p>point is just listen, we have a State Department with its own</p>
<p>agenda. It loves regime change. It loves having clients all over</p>
<p>the world and inserting its fingers in the pie. And unless</p>
<p>Biden Hold on, if unless Biden stands up to his own State</p>
<p>Department, we will not get a ceasefire and we will not get a</p>
<p>peace deal. And that will be disastrous for his presidency.</p>
<p>What I will say is, I think Biden has done a very good job.</p>
<p>And I know Tony really well. And I think Tony&rsquo;s trying to do</p>
<p>the best job he can. I think he&rsquo;s done a pretty good job, all</p>
<p>things considered as well. That&rsquo;s pretty</p>
<p>very any final final thoughts here on, you know, a very</p>
<p>difficult time period we&rsquo;re living through the global order</p>
<p>is being restructured. It&rsquo;s predictable. I think again, if</p>
<p>you read Ray Dalio&rsquo;s book, which I recommended heavily last</p>
<p>year, it&rsquo;s surprising how much of that simple rubric is playing</p>
<p>out today, exactly as that rubric kind of estimated it</p>
<p>would. And you know that look, I mean, by the way, one way to</p>
<p>think about the China, Russia, US dynamic, you know, you got a</p>
<p>one, two and three player game theories, number one wants two</p>
<p>and three to be at it, because then they&rsquo;ll, you know, end up</p>
<p>diminishing value. Number two wants one and three to be at it.</p>
<p>Number three wants one and two to be at it. And so we&rsquo;re seeing</p>
<p>that that multi party game theory play out right now. And</p>
<p>you know, again, based on that rubric, you could probably</p>
<p>predict where this is all gonna end up</p>
<p>brilliant point. Listen, if you were to look at this from the</p>
<p>Chinese standpoint, they must be loving what&rsquo;s going on loving</p>
<p>it. Old saying, I think Napoleon said it never interrupt</p>
<p>your enemy when he&rsquo;s making a mistake. Why is China so quiet</p>
<p>right now? Well, yeah, because they love their dream. Their</p>
<p>dream is the US and Russia attacking each other.</p>
<p>Yeah, we have to implement energy independence writ large.</p>
<p>And we have to make sure that it is very clear we have influence</p>
<p>amongst all these OECD countries. Because if China takes</p>
<p>one foot over the line, we have to have the ability to do to</p>
<p>them what we&rsquo;ve done to Russia economically. It&rsquo;s the only way</p>
<p>in which we can ratchet down all this tension and find peace.</p>
<p>Yes, the new war is the war on our dependency on dictators, we</p>
<p>much must must have a race to resiliency. We&rsquo;re going to talk</p>
<p>about this and more at the all in May 15 16 17. No more. May</p>
<p>15 16 and 17. All in some at Miami. 500 of the 700 tickets</p>
<p>are gone. If you want to apply for a scholarship, you can apply</p>
