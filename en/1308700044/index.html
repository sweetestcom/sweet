    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Our cards this week are Joyce Tina Gallegos and Gabrielle DeStefano, the seven and three</p>
<p>of spades from Utah.</p>
<p>In 1982, Tina and Gabby mysteriously disappeared from the same northern Utah city only days</p>
<p>apart.</p>
<p>When their bodies were found just miles from each other, many people took notice of the</p>
<p>similarities in their cases, and a recent development in the case has permanently linked</p>
<p>their two murders.</p>
<p>For 40 years, their cases have been unsolved, but police are still hopeful the right person</p>
<p>is out there, who has the power to bring their killer or killers to justice.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Ashley Flowers, and this is The Deck.</p>
<p>It was 2005 at the Weber County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office in Utah.</p>
<p>The agency&rsquo;s stack of cold cases were piling up.</p>
<p>So then-Sgt.</p>
<p>Janice Van Orden decided to revisit some of the cases that she&rsquo;d been watching collect</p>
<p>dust on the shelf for years, particularly two of the county&rsquo;s coldest cases that had</p>
<p>been brought to her attention by a friend of hers who was an investigator at the Weber</p>
<p>County&rsquo;s attorney&rsquo;s office.</p>
<p>This was the 1982 murders of Joyce Tina Gallegos and Gabrielle DeStefano.</p>
<p>Law enforcement in Weber County had long suspected that the two cases were related, but to date</p>
<p>no one could prove it, it was just a feeling.</p>
<p>Gabby and Tina didn&rsquo;t know each other, but they ran in the same circles.</p>
<p>Both girls were killed in 1982 within a few days of each other, their bodies found within</p>
<p>the same five-mile radius, and both of them were killed with the same kind of weapon.</p>
<p>But Sgt.</p>
<p>Van Orden wasn&rsquo;t satisfied with just a feeling, a mere theory wouldn&rsquo;t even get them close</p>
<p>to finding the monster who did this.</p>
<p>If they were connected, she wanted to be able to prove it.</p>
<p>So she and other detectives with the Weber County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office dove head first</p>
<p>into Gabby and Tina&rsquo;s cases, re-familiarizing themselves with the two investigations that</p>
<p>hadn&rsquo;t seen any movement since 1984, a whopping 21 years earlier.</p>
<p>They started with Tina&rsquo;s case, since she was the first one to be killed.</p>
<p>And when they went to dig up Tina&rsquo;s files, they realized it would be a bit more difficult</p>
<p>than they thought to revisit her case, because most of the initial reports were missing.</p>
<p>They just completely vanished.</p>
<p>That meant tons of vital information was just gone, and it meant that they&rsquo;d have to gather</p>
<p>the decades-old information they needed another way.</p>
<p>So Sgt.</p>
<p>Van Orden reached out to the original detectives on the case, hoping that maybe they had the</p>
<p>files tucked away in their basement somewhere, or at the very least, hopefully they remembered</p>
<p>enough information to give her a summary of the case and the initial investigation.</p>
<p>But her hopes were dashed.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t learn anything from them.</p>
<p>All I got was a, I can&rsquo;t remember, it&rsquo;s been too long ago.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how you could lose a murder investigation, a report of a murder investigation, and not</p>
<p>know what you did with your report.</p>
<p>That is your report.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t give it away.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t go to a meeting and say, okay, take this.</p>
<p>It just blows my mind that anything like that would ever happen with a homicide.</p>
<p>But Sgt.</p>
<p>Van Orden wasn&rsquo;t giving up.</p>
<p>She knew that there were two other agencies in Weber County that had a hand in the initial</p>
<p>investigation, the Harrisville and Ogden Police Departments.</p>
<p>She reached out to both agencies, and thankfully, they both still had reports on Tina&rsquo;s case.</p>
<p>Sgt.</p>
<p>Van Orden assembled a team of other investigators, and together, they combed through the reports</p>
<p>to figure out what happened to Tina all those years ago.</p>
<p>And here is the timeline that they were able to piece together.</p>
<p>On August 21st, 1982, a fisherman in Ogden, Utah, was enjoying a bright summer day at</p>
<p>the Ogden River when something unusual caught his eye.</p>
<p>Out in the middle of the river, resting on a sandbank, was what looked to be a person</p>
<p>just laying there, motionless.</p>
<p>When the person didn&rsquo;t move for several minutes, the fisherman started to fear the</p>
<p>worst, so he left to go find a phone and call police.</p>
<p>Soon after, deputies with the Weber County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office arrived on scene.</p>
<p>The person on the sandbank was a young woman, and unfortunately, there were no signs of life.</p>
<p>Just by looking at her, it was easy for deputies to tell that she had been dead for a while.</p>
<p>She was dressed in a pair of Levi&rsquo;s jeans and a plain shirt, with her jewelry still on.</p>
<p>Though she didn&rsquo;t have any ID on her, so it wasn&rsquo;t immediately clear who she was.</p>
<p>But officers could tell that she was maybe 20, 30 years old, and she had suffered some</p>
<p>kind of trauma to her head.</p>
<p>Once she was taken for autopsy, her exact cause of death was immediately clear.</p>
<p>The medical examiner found that she had been shot twice, once through her lower eyelid</p>
<p>and once through the back of the neck.</p>
<p>I mean, to police, this looked like an execution.</p>
<p>The ME determined that the weapon used was a large caliber gun, a .38, one of the bullets</p>
<p>that was still lodged in her skull was extracted to keep as evidence.</p>
<p>The ME noted that the woman was badly bruised, but it didn&rsquo;t seem to be because of a beating.</p>
<p>The bruising seemed to have been postmortem, likely from hitting rocks and debris as she</p>
<p>floated down the river.</p>
<p>Now in 2005, when her case was being reexamined, detectives couldn&rsquo;t find any information</p>
<p>on how the woman was identified.</p>
<p>There weren&rsquo;t any missing persons reports matching the woman, so it couldn&rsquo;t have been</p>
<p>through that route.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s likely that she was identified through fingerprints or maybe dental records.</p>
<p>Whichever way it happened, within a few days of the woman being found, authorities confirmed</p>
<p>her identity.</p>
<p>She was 21-year-old Ogden resident Joyce Tina Gallegos.</p>
<p>When police first learned her name, it probably sounded familiar because for the past week,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;d had her purse in their possession.</p>
<p>On August 13th, someone had come to the police station and turned in a purse that they found</p>
<p>in the Ogden River.</p>
<p>Once again, detectives in 2005 don&rsquo;t know who exactly it was that turned it in.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s another part of Tina&rsquo;s case that&rsquo;s been lost to time.</p>
<p>All that was written down was that someone who found it somewhere came in and turned</p>
<p>it in on the 13th.</p>
<p>Anyway, once Tina was identified, her family was located and notified of her death.</p>
<p>No one had reported her missing, but she hadn&rsquo;t exactly been missing for a concerning amount</p>
<p>of time.</p>
<p>Friends and family had just seen her out and about on the 11th, which is just 10 days before</p>
<p>she was found.</p>
<p>One relative told deputies that they&rsquo;d seen Tina at a bus stop in downtown Ogden.</p>
<p>As those original detectives interviewed friends and family, one detail about Tina&rsquo;s final</p>
<p>days stuck out to them.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;d recently been in a fight, and interestingly enough, the fight happened to be at the same</p>
<p>bus stop where she was last seen at, just a day before she disappeared.</p>
<p>Tina was interviewed by police the day of that fight, and this is what she said happened.</p>
<p>She was waiting for the bus after leaving the Weber County Vocational Workshop when</p>
<p>she saw a man who was later identified as Shannon Hale, and this man was pushing people</p>
<p>around.</p>
<p>Tina said when she asked him to stop, his aggression turned toward her.</p>
<p>He slapped her several times, which caused her to fall to the ground and bump her head.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when a counselor from the workshop came running outside to break up the fight.</p>
<p>When police arrived and talked to Shannon, he told them that Tina started it, though</p>
<p>Tina denied instigating things, but she did decide not to press charges.</p>
<p>As those original investigators continued to look further into Tina&rsquo;s life, it seemed</p>
<p>that other than Shannon, Tina didn&rsquo;t really have enemies.</p>
<p>Our reporting team spoke with Steve Haney, an investigator with the Weber County Attorney&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Office.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s reexamining the case today alongside the Weber County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office, and Steve</p>
<p>said that even though Tina lived a rather quiet life, she was known to have a dangerous</p>
<p>habit.</p>
<p>She was a free spirit.</p>
<p>Everybody seemed to like her.</p>
<p>She, you know, would, like I said, hang around Ogden and stand there until somebody rolled</p>
<p>up and then hop in with them.</p>
<p>She knew a lot of people.</p>
<p>She usually jumped in with somebody she knew, but sometimes it was just some random person</p>
<p>who would just give her a ride.</p>
<p>But then again, Ogden was also a lot different, you know.</p>
<p>Everything was.</p>
<p>back in 1982, you know, and there was a lot of, like, trust that you could jump in in</p>
<p>a vehicle with somebody and not be putting yourself in danger.</p>
<p>Just three days after Tina&rsquo;s body was found, police were already hitting a wall.</p>
<p>Detective Mike Wells was interviewed by the Daily Herald and said the case was puzzling.</p>
<p>He said, quote,</p>
<p>We are following up on routine leads, but we have nothing definite.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t appear that robbery was the motive since her jewelry was still intact.</p>
<p>And it doesn&rsquo;t appear it was a sex crime because she was fully clothed, end quote.</p>
<p>But the setback in the investigation didn&rsquo;t last long.</p>
<p>24 hours after that article was published, an arrest was made.</p>
<p>A 35-year-old man who we&rsquo;ll call Raymond was arrested on a warrant all the way over</p>
<p>in San Jose, California, 800-some miles away from Ogden, Utah.</p>
<p>And he was charged with second-degree murder in Tina&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re probably wondering the same thing everyone else was wondering when news of his</p>
<p>arrest broke.</p>
<p>What did a California man have to do with a Utah woman&rsquo;s murder?</p>
<p>Well, Raymond had actually lived in Utah with his mother for quite some time before moving</p>
<p>to California.</p>
<p>They lived in Clearfield together, which is about 15 minutes south of Ogden.</p>
<p>Not only that, but Raymond had known Tina when he lived in Utah.</p>
<p>They only knew each other for about two months, but sometime within those two months, they</p>
<p>went on some dates.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t fully explained what Raymond&rsquo;s motive would have been for killing Tina or</p>
<p>why police zeroed in on him so quickly.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s deeply puzzled detectives who were reviewing the case in 2005.</p>
<p>But according to court documents our reporting team got, he was charged with second-degree</p>
<p>murder and held on a $100,000 bond.</p>
<p>On September 16th, 26 days after Tina was found, Raymond&rsquo;s preliminary hearing was</p>
<p>held.</p>
<p>And imagine Raymond&rsquo;s defense team thought this would be a pretty open and shut case.</p>
<p>There was no evidence that their client had anything to do with the murder.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s more, he currently lived in an entirely different state.</p>
<p>But what the defense team didn&rsquo;t know was that the prosecution was preparing to drop</p>
<p>a bombshell.</p>
<p>They had a key witness who was ready to go public.</p>
<p>Now I want to pause for a moment and let you know that the information you&rsquo;re about to</p>
<p>hear is something that has completely fallen through the cracks over the past few decades.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been entirely forgotten.</p>
<p>Like I said earlier, because Tina&rsquo;s case file was lost, that means a ton of vital information</p>
<p>disappeared from law enforcement&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<p>Vital information like potentially damning testimony from their primary suspect&rsquo;s preliminary</p>
<p>hearing.</p>
<p>Detectives on the case today weren&rsquo;t even aware that this witness existed until our</p>
<p>investigative team uncovered old archived newspaper articles detailing the court proceedings</p>
<p>against Raymond.</p>
<p>So what I&rsquo;m about to tell you has been, by a complete accident, one of the best kept</p>
<p>secrets in Weber County history.</p>
<p>At Raymond&rsquo;s preliminary hearing, the prosecution called to the stand a 28-year-old man named</p>
<p>Frank Gailey.</p>
<p>According to reporting done by both the Salt Lake Tribune and the Daily Herald, Frank was</p>
<p>introduced in the hearing as a quote-unquote Ogden police undercover narcotics officer.</p>
<p>And what Frank told the court put an end to the looming question of why police had gotten</p>
<p>tunnel vision for Raymond.</p>
<p>You see, Frank testified that back on August 12th, the day after Tina was last seen, Raymond</p>
<p>confessed to him that he killed Tina and then dumped her in the Ogden River.</p>
<p>Frank also said that during this interaction, Raymond tried to sell him a large caliber</p>
<p>pistol.</p>
<p>Now, this is where things get really confusing.</p>
<p>After Frank testified, Raymond&rsquo;s defense attorney pointed out something in an attempt</p>
<p>to tarnish Frank&rsquo;s credibility.</p>
<p>He noted that Frank himself had two felony convictions on his record.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what stumps me.</p>
<p>Like I said earlier, Frank was referred to as an undercover narcotics officer.</p>
<p>So how is he also a felon?</p>
<p>Like that is actually one of the few stipulations for becoming a police officer.</p>
<p>You cannot have any felony convictions.</p>
<p>Our team spoke with Sergeant Terrence Lavely with the Weber County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office for</p>
<p>this episode, and we asked how in the world a man with two felony convictions could have</p>
<p>been a law enforcement officer.</p>
<p>And Sergeant Lavely said that it might have been a case where newspaper reporters misunderstood</p>
<p>who Frank was.</p>
<p>Perhaps Frank was actually a confidential informant, not an undercover narcotics officer</p>
<p>as newspapers at the time reported.</p>
<p>But that explanation is also baffling because if that were the case, if Frank were a confidential</p>
<p>informant, then why would the newspapers openly name him?</p>
<p>And the court documents we have don&rsquo;t clarify this whatsoever.</p>
<p>Okay, whether Frank was an undercover officer or a confidential informant, either way, his</p>
<p>testimony was damning.</p>
<p>But Raymond maintained his innocence and pleaded not guilty.</p>
<p>In fact, he said that he couldn&rsquo;t have killed Tina because he was in California at that</p>
<p>point, hours away from where Tina was killed.</p>
<p>It took a while for his defense team to prove his alibi.</p>
<p>But according to reporting by the Daily Herald, by early November, the judge was satisfied</p>
<p>with the proof and actually dropped the charges against Raymond altogether less than two weeks</p>
<p>before his trial was scheduled to begin.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not clear what alibi was so convincing for the judge to drop all charges before the</p>
<p>trial.</p>
<p>But whatever the case, Raymond went on to file a $350,000 lawsuit against the Weber</p>
<p>County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office, also against a handful of individual deputies, the county</p>
<p>and the state of Utah for being wrongfully accused.</p>
<p>There are many things about Tina&rsquo;s case that are frustrating, but this is the part</p>
<p>that leaves my head spinning.</p>
<p>If Raymond&rsquo;s alibi was proven to be airtight beyond a shadow of a doubt, then that means</p>
<p>that Frank was flat out lying.</p>
<p>So why would this Frank guy lie about something so serious?</p>
<p>Was he trying to cover his own tracks?</p>
<p>And I still can&rsquo;t get over, who is this man?</p>
<p>Is he an undercover narcotics officer, a now publicly identified confidential informant,</p>
<p>or is he just some guy?</p>
<p>And obviously at AudioChuck, we don&rsquo;t like not knowing.</p>
<p>So with the help of Detective Haney, our reporting team did some digging and we got our hands</p>
<p>on some court documents from Raymond&rsquo;s trial.</p>
<p>But unfortunately, the documents weren&rsquo;t nearly as detailed as we hoped.</p>
<p>The records say that Frank Gailey did testify at Raymond&rsquo;s preliminary hearing because</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s listed as a witness, but they don&rsquo;t say what he said or even who he was.</p>
<p>So Detective Haney tried another route, city records.</p>
<p>He went through Ogden&rsquo;s old records and he found no evidence that Frank was ever a</p>
<p>police officer with the city.</p>
<p>So Detective Haney says it&rsquo;s likely that Frank was a police informant because that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the only explanation that makes sense of the fact that he had felonies on his record.</p>
<p>But again, even if that&rsquo;s the case, it&rsquo;s still unclear why he accused Raymond of the</p>
<p>murder.</p>
<p>So our reporting team put in a records request to the Ogden Police Department to see if they</p>
<p>had record of Frank&rsquo;s employment with the department.</p>
<p>As of this recording, we still haven&rsquo;t received any such records and we knew it would take</p>
<p>some time.</p>
<p>So our reporting team decided to look Frank up and see if we could contact him directly</p>
<p>to confirm once and for all who he was and why he testified at Raymond&rsquo;s hearing.</p>
<p>But sadly, all we found was his obituary.</p>
<p>According to Provident Funeral Homes, he passed away in August 2018.</p>
<p>So we tried the next best thing after that.</p>
<p>Our reporter found Frank&rsquo;s widow on Facebook and sent her a message just asking if she</p>
<p>could confirm or deny if Frank was ever an undercover narcotics officer.</p>
<p>And minutes after sending that message, our reporter got blocked.</p>
<p>So our reporter tried the cell number that we found for her online, but it was actually</p>
<p>a wrong number.</p>
<p>Even without total confirmation, the fact that both the city and the police department</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t have record of his employment and the fact that he had two felonies on his record,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s safe to say that Frank was not an undercover narcotics officer.</p>
<p>But it does still leave a few questions.</p>
<p>Why did both the Daily Herald and the Salt Lake Tribune report the exact same wording</p>
<p>that Frank was a, quote, Ogden Police undercover narcotics officer?</p>
<p>Did both of the papers get that vital information wrong or was someone lying about who Frank</p>
<p>was?</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Maybe it doesn&rsquo;t matter all that much who he was.</p>
<p>Because the fact of the matter is that regardless of title, either Frank or Raymond was flat</p>
<p>out lying.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Either Frank&rsquo;s testimony was BS or Raymond&rsquo;s alibi was.</p>
<p>And whoever was lying got away with it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the mystery.</p>
<p>And frankly, it&rsquo;s a mystery that may never be solved.</p>
<p>Because police have never addressed it.</p>
<p>And up until our reporter started looking into the case, it was a forgotten part of</p>
<p>Tina&rsquo;s story.</p>
<p>So after the charges against Raymond were dropped, Tina&rsquo;s case went cold.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s how it would stay for decades, until Sergeant Van Orden and her team set</p>
<p>out to warm it up.</p>
<p>And once they&rsquo;d familiarized themselves with Tina&rsquo;s case, they needed to learn the</p>
<p>ins and outs of Gabby DeStefano&rsquo;s case.</p>
<p>Because while authorities in Ogden had been busy investigating Tina&rsquo;s murder, Gabby&rsquo;s</p>
<p>body was found just 10 minutes up the road.</p>
<p>Now this case was a bit easier for Sergeant Van Orden and her team to dive into because</p>
<p>the initial reports were all still intact.</p>
<p>So in 2005, Sergeant Van Orden moved from reviewing Tina&rsquo;s unsolved murder to Gabby&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>And this is what she pieced together.</p>
<p>On September 16th, 1982, a construction worker in Harrisville, Utah, about 10 minutes north</p>
<p>of Ogden, was working on a large plot of land that was in the beginning stages of becoming</p>
<p>a residential subdivision.</p>
<p>It was almost noon, and he was digging a ditch with a backhoe when he saw some litter in</p>
<p>the ditch a few feet away.</p>
<p>But when he got closer, he realized that he was looking at a shower curtain covered up</p>
<p>by a bit of dirt, and it looked like something big was wrapped up in the curtain.</p>
<p>So he called over his supervisor.</p>
<p>The supervisor agreed that the shower curtain in the ditch is odd, so they unraveled it</p>
<p>to see what was inside.</p>
<p>And beneath, there was a towel inscribed with the words apartment 15.</p>
<p>They also found some clothing and something else.</p>
<p>At first, it was hard to tell exactly what it was, but then it hit them.</p>
<p>They were looking at a severely decomposed human body.</p>
<p>They phoned the Harrisville Police Department, and officers responded right away.</p>
<p>Police confirmed that it was human remains wrapped up in the curtain, but the decomposition</p>
<p>was so severe that it was impossible for them to know the person&rsquo;s gender or age.</p>
<p>This also meant that they couldn&rsquo;t immediately tell how the person died.</p>
<p>In fact, a local newspaper reported that officers weren&rsquo;t even sure whether or not they were</p>
<p>dealing with foul play.</p>
<p>I mean, for me, the fact that a person was wrapped in a shower curtain screams foul play,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s possible that police were just trying to protect the integrity of the investigation</p>
<p>by saying that.</p>
<p>But regardless, it didn&rsquo;t take long for authorities to know for sure that there was foul play</p>
<p>involved.</p>
<p>The ME found that the cause of death was a single gunshot wound to the head, and the</p>
<p>person was identified through dental records as 14-year-old Gabrielle DiStefano, who&rsquo;d</p>
<p>been missing for a full month.</p>
<p>Once police knew they had a homicide on their hands, they got to work right away.</p>
<p>Detectives needed to determine Gabby&rsquo;s last movement, so they interviewed family and friends.</p>
<p>Gabby&rsquo;s mom Edie had last seen her in mid-August, but she actually hadn&rsquo;t reported her missing</p>
<p>until August 25th.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s because Edie initially assumed Gabby was staying with friends, but after a week</p>
<p>and a half of not seeing her, she knew that something was wrong, so she reported her missing</p>
<p>to the Ogden Police Department.</p>
<p>So in 2005, as Sergeant Van Orden was reviewing Gabby&rsquo;s file, she was relieved to see that</p>
<p>former detectives had documented their initial interviews.</p>
<p>According to reports in the case file, Edie told detectives that the last interaction</p>
<p>she had with Gabby was around 6 p.m. on August 15th.</p>
<p>Gabby was gathering her things and preparing to leave the house, and she said she was going</p>
<p>to a friend&rsquo;s house and promised to be home by 11.</p>
<p>But when those detectives interviewed Gabby&rsquo;s friends, they heard a different story.</p>
<p>They reported seeing Gabby that evening at Paramount Bowl, which is this popular hangout</p>
<p>spot for teens in the Ogden area.</p>
<p>But there was some speculation that she wasn&rsquo;t there to bowl.</p>
<p>Police caught wind of a rumor that Gabby was meeting some friends at the bowling alley</p>
<p>so they could all carpool to a house party in Riverdale, which is 10 minutes south of</p>
<p>Ogden.</p>
<p>That story was never confirmed, but it&rsquo;s something the original detectives kept in</p>
<p>mind as they continued investigating.</p>
<p>Whether Gabby went to the Paramount Bowl that night, or if she was going to a party, or</p>
<p>even if she was telling the truth and went to a friend&rsquo;s house, Edie told investigators</p>
<p>she actually saw Gabby again later that same night in the wee hours of the morning on August</p>
<p>16th.</p>
<p>Edie said that around 1 a.m. she heard a car pulling into her driveway.</p>
<p>You see, her bedroom window faced the driveway, so she peeked out to see who it was, and it</p>
<p>was a car she recognized, a candy apple red lowrider, maybe a Chevy Impala.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;d seen Gabby get picked up by that car before.</p>
<p>As Edie watched out the window, she saw Gabby and someone else in the front seat and two</p>
<p>other people in the back seat.</p>
<p>But what she witnessed next was kind of odd.</p>
<p>The car sat there in the driveway, brake lights on, for five minutes, but no one got</p>
<p>out of the car.</p>
<p>Then after five minutes, the car&rsquo;s headlights flipped on and it sped out of the driveway.</p>
<p>Edie didn&rsquo;t know it at the time, but that was the last time she would ever see her daughter.</p>
<p>A few days after detectives talked to Edie, one of Gabby&rsquo;s friends who had seen her the</p>
<p>night of August 15th was formally interviewed.</p>
<p>She said that she saw Gabby around 9 p.m. that evening at Paramount Bowl.</p>
<p>Just like Edie had told police, the friend also had seen Gabby in a red lowrider car</p>
<p>with a few other people, maybe four or five.</p>
<p>And what stood out to this friend is that she didn&rsquo;t recognize the people that Gabby</p>
<p>was in the car with, and they didn&rsquo;t look like people Gabby would normally be hanging</p>
<p>out with.</p>
<p>Now, for a few months, that is all the initial investigators had to go on.</p>
<p>They were looking for a bright red lowrider car.</p>
<p>Again, maybe it was a Chevy Impala.</p>
<p>From what Sergeant Van Orden could tell from Gabby&rsquo;s case file, police didn&rsquo;t receive</p>
<p>their next big tip until November.</p>
<p>The tipster who came forward named not one, but two potential suspects, the first being</p>
<p>a girl we&rsquo;re going to call Teresa, who apparently had some major beef with Gabby.</p>
<p>It was rumored that there was some sort of love triangle between Teresa, Gabby, and a</p>
<p>boy named Pat Klein.</p>
<p>Teresa and Gabby were both interested in Pat, and Teresa had supposedly threatened to kill</p>
<p>Gabby if she didn&rsquo;t stop seeing him.</p>
<p>The tipster thought Teresa should obviously be considered as a suspect, but it took investigators</p>
<p>like one minute to figure out Teresa was actually in youth lockup at the time of Gabby&rsquo;s</p>
<p>murder.</p>
<p>So the tipster offered up a second suspect, Teresa&rsquo;s ex-boyfriend, 16-year-old Sammy</p>
<p>Mora.</p>
<p>Sammy was also Gabby&rsquo;s ex-boyfriend.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not clear why, but the tipster thought that he was suspicious and should</p>
<p>be looked into.</p>
<p>But it seems like police initially kind of brushed this tip off, likely because they</p>
<p>were so busy chasing other leads that were flooding in.</p>
<p>It seemed that Sammy&rsquo;s name completely fell off detectives&rsquo; radars over the next few</p>
<p>months until April 24th of 1983, when two teenage runaways from Ogden were picked up</p>
<p>in Montana.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to call these two Chloe and Brooke.</p>
<p>From what Sergeant Van Orden could tell us from the case reports, police in Montana found</p>
<p>the girls at a truck stop asking people for money and makeup.</p>
<p>And since the girls looked so young, the officer knew something was up.</p>
<p>They took the girls to a local police station, and that&rsquo;s when they started talking.</p>
<p>And not about what anyone was expecting them to talk about.</p>
<p>Chloe and Brooke started discussing their friend Gabby&rsquo;s murder back home in Utah.</p>
<p>And Chloe said that she knew who killed her, a boy named Sammy Mora.</p>
<p>Chloe said that she and Brooke had been at a party with Sammy and Gabby the night before</p>
<p>Gabby disappeared, and she was pretty sure Sammy was the shooter.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s unclear if authorities in Montana relayed this information to police in Utah</p>
<p>at the time, or even what came of the information.</p>
<p>But it did eventually land in Gabby&rsquo;s case file.</p>
<p>But it took almost a year after the girls were picked up in Montana for police to contact</p>
<p>them again.</p>
<p>Specifically, on March 5th of 1984, Detective Norman Sokai contacted Brooke again, and she</p>
<p>corroborated Chloe&rsquo;s story.</p>
<p>She said she was at the party in Riverdale with Chloe, Sammy, and Gabby, and that she</p>
<p>never saw a gun, but she always thought Sammy was the one who killed Gabby.</p>
<p>Detective Sokai noted that Brooke claimed to have been threatened by someone, and she</p>
<p>seemed nervous.</p>
<p>It was the talk in town at the time that Sammy was one of the three guys involved in Gabby&rsquo;s</p>
<p>death.</p>
<p>The other two were older guys named Larry Lucero and Pete Romero.</p>
<p>And interestingly enough, Sammy, Pete, and Larry all did drive red cars.</p>
<p>Now for some reason, the initial investigators kind of zeroed in on Pete.</p>
<p>And they actually went and picked up his car to be taken to the crime lab.</p>
<p>And get this, in the trunk of his car, they found a blood stain and hair.</p>
<p>When Pete was asked about the blood, he said that it must have gotten there when he loaned</p>
<p>his car out to a friend.</p>
<p>Obviously technicians analyzed the blood, and they were able to determine that it was</p>
<p>type A, which didn&rsquo;t match Gabby&rsquo;s blood type.</p>
<p>And the hair also didn&rsquo;t match Gabby&rsquo;s either.</p>
<p>But after that interaction with police, Pete stopped talking and refused to return to the</p>
<p>police station without a lawyer.</p>
<p>So later that month, police interviewed Sammy.</p>
<p>He denied any and all involvement in Gabby&rsquo;s murder.</p>
<p>He even denied being with her on August 15th of 1982, even though two witnesses put the</p>
<p>two of them together.</p>
<p>At one point during the interview, Sammy became angry and belligerent.</p>
<p>But once he calmed down, he agreed to take a polygraph.</p>
<p>So they set one up for the following day.</p>
<p>But Sammy didn&rsquo;t show.</p>
<p>And instead, he lawyered up.</p>
<p>They tried to do interviews, they tried to do polygraphs, they tried to use informants,</p>
<p>they tried to use the technology that they had at the time.</p>
<p>And nothing kind of got any traction that way.</p>
<p>The case goes cold at that point.</p>
<p>New homicides happen, detectives get promoted, they get, they retire.</p>
<p>And a lot of the times these cases go on the shelves.</p>
<p>And just like Tina&rsquo;s case, Gabby&rsquo;s got tucked away on a shelf for decades.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where Sgt.</p>
<p>Van Orden found both their cases in 2005, just growing colder by the day.</p>
<p>Once she and her team had learned the ins and outs of both cases, they decided to try</p>
<p>some new investigative methods that hadn&rsquo;t been tried before and wouldn&rsquo;t have even</p>
<p>been available in the 80s.</p>
<p>And when they did this, what she uncovered confirmed what police had suspected all along.</p>
<p>In 2008, Sgt.</p>
<p>Van Orden and her team sent bullets from Tina&rsquo;s and Gabby&rsquo;s cases to the crime lab.</p>
<p>And the results proved, once and for all, what Sgt.</p>
<p>Van Orden set out to determine.</p>
<p>The ballistics testing showed that both bullets came from the exact same gun.</p>
<p>But as great of a discovery as this was for both cases, when police dug the bullets out</p>
<p>of evidence, they realized something important was missing.</p>
<p>Every other piece of evidence in Gabby&rsquo;s case had vanished.</p>
<p>Her clothing, the apartment 15 towel, the shower curtain, even the blood found in Pete</p>
<p>Romero&rsquo;s car.</p>
<p>Everything that was found with her body and everything that possibly had usable DNA on</p>
<p>it was gone.</p>
<p>To this day, detectives don&rsquo;t know what happened to the evidence.</p>
<p>But Detective Haney has a theory.</p>
<p>There was a flood of the Harrisville Police Department sometime in the middle to late</p>
<p>80s.</p>
<p>And there was a bunch of stuff that got destroyed, ruined, thrown away in that.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a guess of where it went to.</p>
<p>The stories that we heard was stuff was left out to dry out and then it disappeared.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know, that was really kind of a weird situation with evidence.</p>
<p>Just goes to show you that people aren&rsquo;t doing their job properly.</p>
<p>Sergeant Van Orden was so frustrated at this point.</p>
<p>She had spent the better part of three years by now, between 2005 and 2008, reinvestigating</p>
<p>Tina and Gabby&rsquo;s cases, only to realize that Tina&rsquo;s case file was missing and all</p>
<p>the physical evidence in Gabby&rsquo;s case had also been lost.</p>
<p>Our reporting team talked to a relative of Gabby&rsquo;s and she expressed her deep frustration</p>
<p>with the loss of evidence and whatever mishandling led up to it.</p>
<p>Losing the evidence in Gabby&rsquo;s case was certainly a massive blow to the investigation,</p>
<p>but detectives decided to make the most of the evidence they did still have in their</p>
<p>possession, particularly Tina&rsquo;s purse and its contents.</p>
<p>In 2012, police sent her purse and everything in it to the Utah State Crime Lab, hoping</p>
<p>to get a DNA profile that they could link to the killer.</p>
<p>And specifically, they were most hopeful that they could get DNA found off a joint in her</p>
<p>purse.</p>
<p>I mean, detectives thought it was bound to be loaded with DNA.</p>
<p>But when the items were finally tested, investigators&rsquo; hopes were dashed.</p>
<p>The joint did contain some DNA, but it was just a tiny amount.</p>
<p>In fact, the sample was so minuscule that it didn&rsquo;t even meet the requirements to</p>
<p>be uploaded to CODIS.</p>
<p>It also was so small it couldn&rsquo;t even be used for direct comparison.</p>
<p>The only helpful information police got from the joint is that it contained partial DNA</p>
<p>profiles from at least two men.</p>
<p>But even with this information, police couldn&rsquo;t test the DNA against their prime suspects</p>
<p>because again, the sample simply wasn&rsquo;t big enough.</p>
<p>So they were kind of back to square one.</p>
<p>And after that, there really wasn&rsquo;t much movement in the cases for a few years.</p>
<p>In 2015, the woman who led the efforts to warm up two of the county&rsquo;s coldest cases,</p>
<p>Van Orden, who was a lieutenant at that point, reluctantly retired.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t even want to retire.</p>
<p>I thought about thinking, oh, do I need to really retire?</p>
<p>I could be working on these a little longer, but then I ended up going anyways.</p>
<p>After Lieutenant Van Orden left, the cases would remain motionless for another two years.</p>
<p>But in 2017, things picked back up again.</p>
<p>The Weber County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office and the Harrisville Police Department joined forces</p>
<p>and started re-examining murders in the area from the 80s, including Gabby and Tina&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Their cases were revisited once again, and investigators wanted no stone left unturned.</p>
<p>So they started tracking down key players in the cases, from suspects to witnesses.</p>
<p>In January of 2018, police re-interviewed Chloe, one of those girls who had run away</p>
<p>to Montana in 1984.</p>
<p>When she was re-interviewed, she told police something that she hadn&rsquo;t before.</p>
<p>Not only did she double down on her accusation against Sammy Mora, but she also said that</p>
<p>she was present when Gabby was killed.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s more, Chloe said she was a victim herself.</p>
<p>She told police that she had been sexually assaulted by a group of men back in the 80s,</p>
<p>which included Sammy.</p>
<p>Chloe&rsquo;s statement was a major breakthrough for the case.</p>
<p>I mean, up until this point, no eyewitnesses to the murder had come forward.</p>
<p>But just as unexpectedly and quickly as Chloe came forward with her story, she walked it back.</p>
<p>She called these same investigators back up and gave a statement that says,</p>
<p>I do regret to inform that after 34 years of brain injury seizures where I have hit</p>
<p>my head multiple times, sometimes on concrete, so I do not have a great memory.</p>
<p>And I do not have memory of 34 years ago except pain and fear.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve struggled with alcoholism, addiction, and schizophrenia.</p>
<p>Please leave me alone.</p>
<p>I have nothing more to say.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure it happened.</p>
<p>Whether Chloe was telling the truth the first time or not, investigators were still suspicious</p>
<p>of Sammy, now more than ever.</p>
<p>And they wanted to track him down to hear his side of the story once again all these</p>
<p>years later.</p>
<p>So they did just that.</p>
<p>Later that same year, detectives located Sammy in Texas and re-interviewed him about Gabby&rsquo;s case.</p>
<p>But just as he did three decades earlier, Sammy maintained his innocence.</p>
<p>He swore up and down he had nothing to do with Gabby&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p>But Detective Haney isn&rsquo;t so sure.</p>
<p>When it comes down to it, it&rsquo;s not that I&rsquo;ve never been fooled before because I have, but</p>
<p>I do have some success on instincts of being interviewed so many people in my career, and</p>
<p>I think he knows what happened.</p>
<p>Whether he was the one directly involved in it or he was just a part of it, but I believe</p>
<p>that he knows what happened.</p>
<p>But without solid evidence, like a DNA match or an eyewitness who&rsquo;s willing to testify,</p>
<p>there is not much police can do.</p>
<p>In hopes that DNA technology would advance and be able to make something out of the mixed</p>
<p>sample from the joint found in Tina&rsquo;s purse, detectives collected a DNA sample from Sammy</p>
<p>while they were interviewing him.</p>
<p>They also tracked down Pete to gather samples from him, and since Larry was a felon in a</p>
<p>separate crime, his DNA was already on file.</p>
<p>In 2020, Detective Haney found a lab that might have the technology capable of doing</p>
<p>what everyone&rsquo;s been waiting for.</p>
<p>I started throwing out inquiries and doing searches and going through all of our cold</p>
<p>cases to just review them, get them fresh in my mind, but also to look for new technology</p>
<p>that we could use.</p>
<p>And I found this new technology, but it wasn&rsquo;t coming online yet.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t accredited yet, but it is now.</p>
<p>That kind of testing is only available through DNA Labs International.</p>
<p>And Detective Haney allowed us to tell you that he was just recently awarded a grant</p>
<p>through the nonprofit I founded called Season of Justice, so they&rsquo;re going to be able</p>
<p>to test their sample from the joint and see if they can make something of it.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s got his fingers crossed that this new technology will allow them to create a full</p>
<p>DNA profile that can be compared to DNA from their prime suspects.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not the only recent development in these cases.</p>
<p>Detective Haney is currently working another lead that he thinks may rattle the investigation</p>
<p>to its core.</p>
<p>Now, since nothing&rsquo;s certain yet, he asked us not to disclose what that development is.</p>
<p>But know that if and when it comes to fruition, we&rsquo;ll keep you updated.</p>
<p>If you know anything about the 1982 murders of Joyce Tina Gallegos and Gabrielle DiStefano,</p>
<p>call the Weber County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office at 801-395-8221.</p>
<p>Gabby and Tina&rsquo;s families have waited far too long for justice.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re out there listening and you work in law enforcement and have a case where</p>
<p>you too have DNA that needs to be tested, don&rsquo;t forget about the nonprofit Season of</p>
<p>Justice.</p>
<p>You can apply for a grant for funding at seasonofjustice.org.</p>
