<p>sleep and how this relates to memory processes¬†
sleep related memory consolidation for example¬†¬†</p>
<p>so i i&rsquo;ve been around this topic for several¬†
years and then i started some research about¬†¬†</p>
<p>vitamin d specifically actually i was involved¬†
in the study that was the first of its kind¬†¬†</p>
<p>giving vitamin d3 to epilepsy patients¬†
who had uncontrolled seizures before¬†¬†</p>
<p>and also had low vitamin d levels and we¬†
looked at how normalizing vitamin d level¬†¬†</p>
<p>changes seizures epileptic seizures so so so¬†
this was the the first step towards doing towards¬†¬†</p>
<p>the the nutritional field and then i became¬†
involved in other aspects like brain structure¬†¬†</p>
<p>related to vitamin d personality traits related¬†
to vitamin d and there were many more around the¬†¬†</p>
<p>vitamin d and then i stepped forward and i i¬†
became interested in in nutrition as a whole¬†¬†</p>
<p>and i know that there is there is¬†
a lot of interest around vitamins¬†¬†</p>
<p>specifically like vitamin d but i had¬†
to realize that the nutritional context¬†¬†</p>
<p>as a whole is is much more important than¬†
single nutrients singular vitamins for example¬†¬†</p>
<p>well that&rsquo;s one of the reasons why i brought you¬†
on because you&rsquo;re in clinical practice which is¬†¬†</p>
<p>a huge difference between someone just doing¬†
research in a lab and never had any experience¬†¬†</p>
<p>they just graduated in their phd and then they¬†
they&rsquo;ve never worked with actual patients so¬†¬†</p>
<p>until you do that you really have not applied¬†
these uh these ideas so yeah that&rsquo;s a huge¬†¬†</p>
<p>makes a huge difference because there are¬†
a lot of material around the internet and¬†¬†</p>
<p>it is very easy to set up theories and own ideas¬†
and those suggestions but if it is not confirmed¬†¬†</p>
<p>um by clinical data then it may not have a¬†
validity that&rsquo;s right i want to dive right into a¬†¬†</p>
<p>very specific topic um intestinal permeability and¬†
exactly what that is and maybe you can can we call¬†¬†</p>
<p>that generally speaking leaky gut a problem¬†
with like a leaky gut yes absolutely okay¬†¬†</p>
<p>and in the relationship to autoimmune disease¬†
since a good portion of our immune system is right¬†¬†</p>
<p>past the border of our intestine um tell us a¬†
little bit about um the the link between these two¬†¬†</p>
<p>topics and there&rsquo;s a lot a lot of questions that¬†
i have i just want to maybe you can give a little¬†¬†</p>
<p>introduction and then what occurs uh when you have¬†
that break in that that&rsquo;s those little junctions¬†¬†</p>
<p>um so the interstellar permeability¬†
is a is a membrane related phenomenon¬†¬†</p>
<p>there are membranes all around within the body¬†
that are connecting and separating uh species¬†¬†</p>
<p>within the body and there are also others¬†
that are separating us from outside the body¬†¬†</p>
<p>and the intestinal membrane is is one of those¬†
membranes and actually it is one of the most¬†¬†</p>
<p>important ones because that is the primary¬†
barrier between the content of our gut so¬†¬†</p>
<p>actually the foods that we are eating and and the¬†
rest of the body so that it is a primary location¬†¬†</p>
<p>and and and a lot of things are determined¬†
here if we are eating certain food items that¬†¬†</p>
<p>we are not supposed to eat then a leaky gut and¬†
increase intestinal permeability will develop¬†¬†</p>
<p>and if it is already there then there are¬†
certain food items that may be the same or¬†¬†</p>
<p>maybe different from the ones that um actually¬†
resulted in the leaky gut but these food items can¬†¬†</p>
<p>go across the barrier and they¬†
may get into the circulation¬†¬†</p>
<p>and then if this has occurred they may form¬†
certain complex with surface molecules of¬†¬†</p>
<p>certain cells within our bodies and if such a¬†
complex is created the immune system may start¬†¬†</p>
<p>attacking that complex because the immune system¬†
um regards this complex as as as a as a foreign¬†¬†</p>
<p>molecule there&rsquo;s a certain part of your immune¬†
system that is actively trying to suppress¬†¬†</p>
<p>autoimmune reactions right there&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s a t¬†
cell that&rsquo;s um trying to prevent that i think¬†¬†</p>
<p>the t helper cells aren&rsquo;t they uh and somehow i¬†
know for example in like uh psoriasis there&rsquo;s a¬†¬†</p>
<p>higher amounts of i guess it would be¬†
like th17 giving you these cytokines¬†¬†</p>
<p>and this cascade of inflammation and now you&rsquo;re¬†
you&rsquo;re in a situation where your own tissue is¬†¬†</p>
<p>attacking cells of the skin yeah so the the¬†
the thing is that uh so far you keep eating¬†¬†</p>
<p>those bad food items the whole process¬†
will be going on so and and there is no¬†¬†</p>
<p>other cue for this than eliminating certain food¬†
items from your diet and then the whole process¬†¬†</p>
<p>can attenuate and um i i&rsquo;m not a scientist at the¬†
molecular level i i cannot tell you whether it is¬†¬†</p>
<p>uh t hat or cells or not or to what extent there¬†
are these are involved or not and i guess nobody¬†¬†</p>
<p>else can really tell this because nobody¬†
looked at specifically a certain dietary¬†¬†</p>
<p>context so that there may be a very different¬†
situation if you are eating a high carb diet and¬†¬†</p>
<p>another one if you are fasting or doing a low carb¬†
diet so it is the diet itself that that matters¬†¬†</p>
<p>and you do not have to think about t harper¬†
says or you do not have to be an immunologist¬†¬†</p>
<p>phd or whatever right the um the interesting¬†
the only point i brought that up is because¬†¬†</p>
<p>there is one nutrient that tends to suppress¬†
that reaction which is vitamin d again we come¬†¬†</p>
<p>back to vitamin d which is interesting because¬†
it tends to modulate inflammation in your body¬†¬†</p>
<p>question i have as far as the¬†
you have a very specific um¬†¬†</p>
<p>uh diet or eating plan which is very¬†
beneficial to people with autoimmune¬†¬†</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s um it&rsquo;s not carnivore but it&rsquo;s a kind¬†
of a paleolithic version of keto um explain that¬†¬†</p>
<p>uh it is sorry just going back to the¬†
vitamin d point um the thing is that i¬†¬†</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t believe that vitamin d alone is enough¬†
to counteract the inflammation process or¬†¬†</p>
<p>psoriasis it is the elimination of certain food¬†
items that really matters if you do not eliminate¬†¬†</p>
<p>then then you can have a skyrocketing¬†
vitamin d level and it will not help¬†¬†</p>
<p>absolutely and that&rsquo;s the problem with most people¬†
they like they don&rsquo;t change their basic eating¬†¬†</p>
<p>they think a pill or a drug is going to do it but¬†
that that&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s kind of an altered sequence¬†¬†</p>
<p>you first have to fix the what you put in the body¬†
before you even deal with some of these remedies¬†¬†</p>
<p>yes okay so the other question uh how how this¬†
diet differs from the classical ketogenic diet¬†¬†</p>
<p>yes this is your question yes so um it it is only¬†
the ratio between meat that protein fat and um</p>
<p>carbohydrate that determines whether you are¬†
entering in ketosis or not it this is very simple¬†¬†</p>
<p>actually it is very simple to induce ketosis¬†
if you eat the right amount and the right ratio¬†¬†</p>
<p>of these make macronutrients but um creating¬†
keto this is not not enough it is not enough¬†¬†</p>
<p>it is enough for something if you are¬†
aim if you are aiming at losing weight¬†¬†</p>
<p>improving body composition improving blood sugar¬†
hypertension then ketosis alone may be enough¬†¬†</p>
<p>but if you have an autoimmune condition or if you¬†
have cancer then ketosis alone will not be enough¬†¬†</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not saying may not it will not be enough right¬†¬†</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s something that that you have to keep¬†
in mind that any ketogenic diet will not be enough¬†¬†</p>
<p>if you are struggling with a specific¬†
autoimmunity or cancer and this is because¬†¬†</p>
<p>the composition of your diet also matters¬†
not just on macronutrient composition¬†¬†</p>
<p>and it is only a diet that is based on meat fat¬†
and organ meats that is effective in in combatix¬†¬†</p>
<p>combating such conditions if you are eating a¬†
classical version of ketogenic diet let&rsquo;s put¬†¬†</p>
<p>it in this way that is containing vegetable oils¬†
and dairy which is the case with the classical¬†¬†</p>
<p>ketogenic diet or there are other mct oil based¬†
and then the other ones that all uh are based on¬†¬†</p>
<p>unhealthy vegetable oils and dairy let me let¬†
me define the classical for those people that¬†¬†</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know there&rsquo;s a lot of initial research on¬†
using what&rsquo;s called a classical ketogenic diet¬†¬†</p>
<p>for epilepsy in these children where they&rsquo;re¬†
they&rsquo;re not looking at the the quality of the¬†¬†</p>
<p>the product so you so you&rsquo;re doing like this¬†
mayonnaise and whipping cream and all these¬†¬†</p>
<p>i consider uh bad quality foods and uh even though¬†
even though it&rsquo;s uh low carb it&rsquo;s going to be a¬†¬†</p>
<p>problem go ahead yeah yeah exactly and here we¬†
come back to the intestinal permeability issue¬†¬†</p>
<p>because such a diet the classical ketogenic diet¬†
is not able to normalize intestinal permeability¬†¬†</p>
<p>and if you do not normalize intestinal¬†
permeability the whole process will be going on¬†¬†</p>
<p>and and this is not out of theory what i am¬†
saying we see this being measured in our patients¬†¬†</p>
<p>in course of their diseases is there any um¬†
like there&rsquo;s two there&rsquo;s two things going¬†¬†</p>
<p>on you have the elimination of things that¬†
irritate and cause inflammation in the gut¬†¬†</p>
<p>but you also have is there any direct um healing¬†
factor of either certain organ meats or saturated¬†¬†</p>
<p>fats on the intestinal lining itself no no these¬†
are separate things so so there are there are¬†¬†</p>
<p>certain food items like milk vegetable oil grains¬†
nitrates that are creating intestinal permeability¬†¬†</p>
<p>medicines as well or anti-inflammatory drugs¬†
have a huge effect they are creating intestinal¬†¬†</p>
<p>permeability their leaky gut and if you have the¬†
leaky gut and go on eating grains milk potato and¬†¬†</p>
<p>so on then that will create inflammation in the¬†
body that we create an increase in the intestine¬†¬†</p>
<p>in the inflammatory factors so the the¬†
the inflammation is is the end result¬†¬†</p>
<p>and you cannot interfere with vitamin d¬†
you can only interfere with elimination¬†¬†</p>
<p>so when you when you switch your¬†
diet to what you&rsquo;re doing right now¬†¬†</p>
<p>um you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re eliminating the um¬†
the irritation the stimulation of this¬†¬†</p>
<p>this inflammatory process we are eliminating¬†
those factors that maintain the leaky gut¬†¬†</p>
<p>and as a result there will be a decrease in the¬†
inflammation and the symptoms and eventually¬†¬†</p>
<p>curing disease love it and so can you give my¬†
viewers an idea of like examples of types of foods¬†¬†</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re going to be doing you&rsquo;re not going¬†
to be doing low fat protein you want to do high¬†¬†</p>
<p>higher fat proteins what would be some¬†
examples of that so um speaking of cancer¬†¬†</p>
<p>you know not this is not aimed at your¬†
general audience maybe but specifically¬†¬†</p>
<p>those who have an already existing disease¬†
have undergone chemotherapy radiotherapy so¬†¬†</p>
<p>so the possibilities for them are very narrow¬†
okay so for these people um there is a core diet</p>
<p>which only includes meat fats and organ¬†
meats also autoimmune patients right¬†¬†</p>
<p>also autoimmune patients yes so so they¬†
they do not really have another choice¬†¬†</p>
<p>we would love to uh pleasing patients saying¬†
then that you can introduce this and that and¬†¬†</p>
<p>um but it wouldn&rsquo;t um be in¬†
the interest of the patient</p>
<p>such patients needs is to restore normal¬†
intestinal barrier because they do not have time¬†¬†</p>
<p>to lose they they have to do it as quickly as¬†
possible yeah and once that&rsquo;s done then and¬†¬†</p>
<p>reach there i used to say they they baseline they¬†
they own has baseline and condition is stabilized¬†¬†</p>
<p>there without medications symptoms and so on¬†
then can they can think about or we can consider¬†¬†</p>
<p>allowing for introducing um certain food items¬†
but this shouldn&rsquo;t be grains this shouldn&rsquo;t be¬†¬†</p>
<p>nitrates and a lot of things shouldn&rsquo;t be and¬†
what um like you would probably find some higher¬†¬†</p>
<p>quality grass-fed maybe fatty sausage or liver¬†
or other foods that are higher in obviously fat¬†¬†</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s actually i find it&rsquo;s really¬†
hard in in the us to find fatty protein now days¬†¬†</p>
<p>at the store it&rsquo;s like you have to go out of your¬†
way to because everything is so lean and um yeah¬†¬†</p>
<p>you know this is absolutely a cultural thing¬†
this is not a problem in europe you know we¬†¬†</p>
<p>grown up eating crazy bread which is¬†
obviously not the best combination of foods¬†¬†</p>
<p>but fat was incorporated heavily in our¬†
diet this is not the case in america because¬†¬†</p>
<p>fear has been feared for so long time¬†
that you didn&rsquo;t you know came across um¬†¬†</p>
<p>and so this is a cultural thing i think¬†
we have a lot of good food items sausages¬†¬†</p>
<p>that are already containing eat fat in a good¬†
ratio and or bloody sausage or or many other¬†¬†</p>
<p>traditional food items and and most of these food¬†
ensembles are coming from from pig pork um which¬†¬†</p>
<p>in here in central europe is is is more widespread¬†
than the beef actually interesting it is also high¬†¬†</p>
<p>higher quality than it is the pork is in the¬†
us i can imagine yeah because i uh i actually¬†¬†</p>
<p>consume a lot of pork and i know a lot of people¬†
are saying well that pork is dirty well i don&rsquo;t¬†¬†</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t buy it from the grocery store i do¬†
the farmers markets where people that i know¬†¬†</p>
<p>they they they don&rsquo;t feed them certain things but¬†
pork is higher in fat it&rsquo;s higher in nutrients¬†¬†</p>
<p>actually b1 i feel better on pork especially pork¬†
sausage what um what about the fish in seafood</p>
<p>um so the the diet of pkd core diet is based¬†
on meat fat and organs from four-legged animals¬†¬†</p>
<p>okay specifically because it is more complete¬†
in nutrients as compared to the fish or any¬†¬†</p>
<p>fish or seafood so there are certain food there¬†
are certain minerals that fish is very rich in¬†¬†</p>
<p>but meat fat and organs are containing the¬†
entirety of the nutrients and at the same time not¬†¬†</p>
<p>um usually not as polluted um as the fish or the¬†
or the seafood fascinating and and uh what um um¬†¬†</p>
<p>when you take your clients you probably have¬†
people coming in flying in from around the world¬†¬†</p>
<p>probably and when you see them um they have all¬†
sorts of autoimmune issues and um what um what are¬†¬†</p>
<p>some of the barriers that you run into i mean this¬†
is a probably a drastic change for a lot of people¬†¬†</p>
<p>are but i&rsquo;m sure that they&rsquo;re motivated and¬†
they&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re like hey listen just tell me what¬†¬†</p>
<p>to do and i&rsquo;ll do it versus the typical person¬†
that is you know not very motivated yes they&rsquo;re¬†¬†</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re more motivated than than average patients¬†
so they are already familiar of the concept so</p>
<p>and and many are coming from the carnivore society¬†
so they are already not eating a lot of food items¬†¬†</p>
<p>um it is only the the the ratio and the food¬†
amount that that should be fine-tuned and um¬†¬†</p>
<p>cutting out a few other additional stuff that¬†
that may not be that may may not allow for a¬†¬†</p>
<p>perfect recovery but we are in content mostly¬†
online specifically in these times oh good how¬†¬†</p>
<p>would you differentiate carnivore versus what¬†
you&rsquo;re recommending which is um paleo ketogenic¬†¬†</p>
<p>so the carnivore diet¬†¬†</p>
<p>in most cases not resulting in ketosis so those¬†
who are following an undefined carnivore diet¬†¬†</p>
<p>are still running their body on carbohydrates¬†
instead of fats despite not eating carbohydrates¬†¬†</p>
<p>tell me about that but explain that yeah so um¬†
an average people on a carnivore diet is eating¬†¬†</p>
<p>800 to 1.5 800 grams to 1.5 kilograms of meat¬†
or something like that which is a huge amount¬†¬†</p>
<p>that put a lot of pressure on your digestive¬†
system because the volume is is too much¬†¬†</p>
<p>um you are not in ketosis you are still¬†
producing glucose from the protein that you eat¬†¬†</p>
<p>and overall it is it is an ineffective way¬†
of obtaining energy so i want to cl i want¬†¬†</p>
<p>to clarify just for my viewers that even¬†
though there&rsquo;s no carbohydrates in protein¬†¬†</p>
<p>if you have excessive amounts the body is going to¬†
take a good portion of that and break it down into¬†¬†</p>
<p>glucose yes because there is¬†
no other way to obtain energy¬†¬†</p>
<p>you can have energy either from carbohydrates¬†
or fat right protein is not good for energy¬†¬†</p>
<p>and we need the energy what you eat is¬†
basically for uh covering your energy needs¬†¬†</p>
<p>it is also a very small amount of meat that¬†
you have to eat to cover the protein need¬†¬†</p>
<p>okay so um so that&rsquo;s a big difference you¬†
have um it&rsquo;s way too much protein and then¬†¬†</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s i&rsquo;ll just let you continue we&rsquo;re¬†
going to mention something about the fat¬†¬†</p>
<p>um sorry i didn&rsquo;t get your question uh i i cut¬†
you off right in the middle you were talking about¬†¬†</p>
<p>um the difference between carnivore¬†
and um what you&rsquo;re recommending</p>
<p>um so so the difference is that if you are¬†
following a carnivore diet you are still¬†¬†</p>
<p>running your body on glucose despite the fact¬†
that you are not eating carbohydrates at all right¬†¬†</p>
<p>so it is not resulting in ketosis you will not¬†
benefit um you will not have the benefits that¬†¬†</p>
<p>are coming from the ketosis alone you will have¬†
the benefits of not eating plant food items but¬†¬†</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s only that that&rsquo;s only half of your benefits¬†
you also need to be in ketosis because if not this¬†¬†</p>
<p>this this state is not sustainable in the long run¬†
and this is what is happening with with patients¬†¬†</p>
<p>initially they they feel relieved from¬†
from their symptoms and they start¬†¬†</p>
<p>enjoying having more energy or skin symptoms going¬†
away so there are certain benefits for sure but as¬†¬†</p>
<p>time is going on um the negative consequences will¬†
prevail over the positive ones you you they will¬†¬†</p>
<p>be running out of energy they will be fatigued¬†
they will have digestive issues diarrhea um¬†¬†</p>
<p>a dry skin and and there are many more that¬†
develop over a longer period of time interesting¬†¬†</p>
<p>so so bringing down the protein to what what¬†
do you normally recommend is actual protein¬†¬†</p>
<p>um so um we used to do um a¬†
two week follow-up for patients¬†¬†</p>
<p>because there is no there is no one general¬†
suggestion that it is much less than¬†¬†</p>
<p>people used to eat okay and then and then we are¬†
in a closed loop with patients on a day by day¬†¬†</p>
<p>feedback they are doing home measurements they¬†
are sending their home measurements every day¬†¬†</p>
<p>and then we are giving a suggestion day by day¬†
you should be decreasing you should be increasing¬†¬†</p>
<p>so so this is a matter of fine tuning i like that¬†
by the end of the two weeks um they will they will¬†¬†</p>
<p>end up having um ideally good amount of food and¬†
good ratio and then as far as the fat you have to¬†¬†</p>
<p>raise the fat or else what else are you going to¬†
raise so what&rsquo;s the ratio maybe a protein to fat¬†¬†</p>
<p>so speaking of dry matter content it is two to¬†
one two for the fat one for the protein and that&rsquo;s¬†¬†</p>
<p>weight that&rsquo;s not calories this is dry matter¬†
content okay macronutrients if we translate it¬†¬†</p>
<p>to food that is about 100 grams of meat an¬†
average meat that goes along with 35 grams of¬†¬†</p>
<p>added fat so this is the basic ratio because¬†
when you&rsquo;re eating protein or or animal¬†¬†</p>
<p>meat in its normal form does it come with the¬†
ratio of that much fat or do you have to add¬†¬†</p>
<p>fat you have to add fat right so you can&rsquo;t just¬†
you can&rsquo;t just go on what nature is product¬†¬†</p>
<p>because we actually have to put your body into¬†
a different but nature is also providing fat it¬†¬†</p>
<p>is just not entrenched in some cultures you know¬†
interesting just because you do not see fat itself¬†¬†</p>
<p>at the butcher it doesn&rsquo;t mean that nature is¬†
not providing the fat you know right and we&rsquo;re¬†¬†</p>
<p>not talking about avocados even coconut oil we&rsquo;re¬†
talking about like talo and um what about ghee¬†¬†</p>
<p>ghee is a form of dairy that is¬†
containing milk proteins that¬†¬†</p>
<p>is triggering autoimmune processes even¬†
when you clarify it and get rid of the¬†¬†</p>
<p>solid materials yes but because you cannot¬†
get rid of all the molecules okay okay not¬†¬†</p>
<p>have a laboratory but it is simply technically¬†
not possible so you have to go with vitello</p>
<p>or in in hungary you can do smoked¬†
slab which is which is the actual uh¬†¬†</p>
<p>fat coming from the actual fat tissue or the pork¬†
and there are a few others you know also you have¬†¬†</p>
<p>something like bacon but the problem with bacon¬†
is when you fry it like all the fat goes away</p>
<p>yes you have to eat the fat that goes away right¬†
right and so for those people are listening and¬†¬†</p>
<p>that are confused because it may conflict¬†
with some other videos that i&rsquo;ve done¬†¬†</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re talking about people¬†
that are addressing that have¬†¬†</p>
<p>intestinal damage autoimmune other conditions¬†
that are going to react with this but¬†¬†</p>
<p>so i just want to clarify that um so can¬†
you give us a couple more examples on¬†¬†</p>
<p>like let&rsquo;s say organ meats um would that have¬†
enough fat or like maybe a pet pate right¬†¬†</p>
<p>what pate which is uh kind of a yeah if you¬†
prepare uh based on your own recipe then it can¬†¬†</p>
<p>contain enough fat of course yeah so so the fat¬†
is uh predominantly coming from the visceral fat¬†¬†</p>
<p>of the animal and and for example beef is not¬†
containing enough fat if if if you take the¬†¬†</p>
<p>whole animal specifically those breeds um that¬†
are designed to be lean that&rsquo;s for sure so so¬†¬†</p>
<p>you have to specifically go for the uh for the¬†
fed that is cut of the of the meat that is sold¬†¬†</p>
<p>for for other clients right right um now let&rsquo;s say¬†
someone has autoimmune there&rsquo;s a i know there is¬†¬†</p>
<p>a test that&rsquo;s called i guess peg peg400 which um¬†
is a lab test that you you drink something it gets¬†¬†</p>
<p>filtered out through the kidneys or the intestines¬†
and the kidneys i guess and you can pick up¬†¬†</p>
<p>some data tell me tell me a little bit about that¬†
actually um this is this is a this is an old test¬†¬†</p>
<p>you can you can find the references uh¬†
in the literature back to 1970s 80s 90s¬†¬†</p>
<p>so it has been used in in in in the medical world¬†
or at least somewhere in the medical world but um¬†¬†</p>
<p>later on they they forgot about it uh mainly¬†
because they didn&rsquo;t have a solution so anybody¬†¬†</p>
<p>they measured had high intestinal permeability¬†
and they asked themselves what can we do we can&rsquo;t¬†¬†</p>
<p>do anything about it so let&rsquo;s stop measuring¬†
it so actually the methodology was was given</p>
<p>and we started using the test¬†
there is a laboratory in london¬†¬†</p>
<p>the laboratory is called biolab and we¬†
first collaborated with this laboratory¬†¬†</p>
<p>we send measurements to them or the¬†
samples but then we started doing our own¬†¬†</p>
<p>own measurements and in order to do so we have¬†
we have furthered the methodology behind it uh¬†¬†</p>
<p>a critical point of the measurement is clarifying¬†
the sample and and and this is uh this is a very¬†¬†</p>
<p>critical point a critical methodological point so¬†
we have been working a lot at this point but now¬†¬†</p>
<p>the the methodology is fathered and it is working¬†
very well so patients um can actually buy they can¬†¬†</p>
<p>can purchase this test even from the u.s they do¬†
not even have to come to hungary or anywhere else</p>
<p>they are getting the test material that is¬†
containing the pegging in a small container¬†¬†</p>
<p>they have to drink the small container and then¬†
they have to collect the urine across six hours¬†¬†</p>
<p>and then a small sample should be sent back to¬†
to our laboratory and then we do the measurement¬†¬†</p>
<p>and and the recovery of the peg in the urine¬†
uh the percentage of the recovery will show¬†¬†</p>
<p>uh the extent of the intestinal permeability so¬†
basically you have these um compounds that are¬†¬†</p>
<p>going through the body and if there&rsquo;s a hole¬†
through your intestine you&rsquo;re going to have¬†¬†</p>
<p>more of them on the other side versus less and you¬†
could be able to get feedback on what&rsquo;s happening¬†¬†</p>
<p>in your gut yeah so so normally there should be¬†
no uh bad molecules going through the intestine¬†¬†</p>
<p>or at least very minimal and if there is if¬†
there are peg molecules crossing the barrier¬†¬†</p>
<p>getting into the circulation being excreted in¬†
the urine it means that there is a permeability¬†¬†</p>
<p>and it is not only about having permeability¬†
or not having a permeability it is 11 different¬†¬†</p>
<p>size of peg molecules that is to be found¬†
in the solution so it it it is giving you um</p>
<p>a resolution across the molecular sizes so at¬†
the end we have a we have a certain curve or or¬†¬†</p>
<p>pattern of the recovery percentages for each of¬†
the specific molecular ranges that is carrying¬†¬†</p>
<p>information and so far the curve is higher¬†
than uh the range that is regarded as normal¬†¬†</p>
<p>it is it it is uh regarded as the patient having¬†
a industrial permeability and it is expected¬†¬†</p>
<p>that uh with following the pkd the intestinal¬†
permeability curve goes back to the normal range¬†¬†</p>
<p>or actually closer to the low end of the normal¬†
range if it is not happening then that there&rsquo;s¬†¬†</p>
<p>still something that is preventing this and and¬†
and this is where the the small details may matter¬†¬†</p>
<p>because there are small food items or even¬†
medicines or even certain supplements that¬†¬†</p>
<p>can hinder the normalization of the intestinal¬†
permeability fascinating i i recently looked¬†¬†</p>
<p>bought and i&rsquo;m looking through and studying a book¬†
that is talking about vaccine-induced autoimmunity</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s your quick summary on the¬†¬†</p>
<p>people getting a vaccine and all of a¬†
sudden ending up with a autoimmune condition</p>
<p>yes that&rsquo;s uh that&rsquo;s a big topic and i do think¬†
that there is definitely a connection because by¬†¬†</p>
<p>injecting the vaccine right into the body you¬†
are bypassing this actual intestinal barrier¬†¬†</p>
<p>in the same way as having very high intestinal¬†
permeability uh but but this material is is is¬†¬†</p>
<p>getting into your body into your tissues and if it¬†
is already there and that can provoke autoimmunity¬†¬†</p>
<p>and and this is this is something that is¬†
frequently uh the case uh with the sudden onset¬†¬†</p>
<p>type one diabetes in children or suddenly crohn&rsquo;s¬†
disease epilepsy or many other brain conditions¬†¬†</p>
<p>and the importance is underestimated by¬†
the medical community but this is happening¬†¬†</p>
<p>yes there&rsquo;s certain um i this book was written¬†
in india so it hasn&rsquo;t reached america uh but¬†¬†</p>
<p>the other other question is um you have¬†
vegetable oils like the soy oil the corn¬†¬†</p>
<p>oil the canola the cottonseedle that¬†
is permeated through our entire food¬†¬†</p>
<p>chain and which is highly inflammatory because¬†
it&rsquo;s omega-6 not to mention the quality and¬†¬†</p>
<p>it oxidizes and it creates a lot of inflammation¬†
uh do you think that&rsquo;s a pretty big factor</p>
<p>um it may be that it is not the fatty acid¬†
um specifically or the fat specifically uh¬†¬†</p>
<p>but other components that are coming from that¬†
specific plant could it be the glyphosate in¬†¬†</p>
<p>the gmo or or other factors no because that¬†
that is an additive uh i i&rsquo;m thinking of¬†¬†</p>
<p>the the lactine content of the plants so¬†
any any plant is containing thousands and¬†¬†</p>
<p>ten thousand some different lectins and some¬†
of some of them are more dangerous are more</p>
<p>more dangerous for intestinal barrier¬†
than others like the soil so is the one¬†¬†</p>
<p>that is heavily triggering industrial permeability¬†¬†</p>
<p>and there are others for example that are coming¬†
from the carrot which are not that dangerous or¬†¬†</p>
<p>do not have such a big effect but it is it is¬†
the lactin um component or or the ones that¬†¬†</p>
<p>are coming from the night shades that are really¬†
bad for okay conditions interesting um what about¬†¬†</p>
<p>um there&rsquo;s a patient that i know a while¬†
ago that had um they didn&rsquo;t have any¬†¬†</p>
<p>necessarily problems with autoimmune but all of a¬†
sudden they did a colon cleanse and they wiped out¬†¬†</p>
<p>everything in their gut for about i think seven¬†
days and they ended up with psoriasis um so¬†¬†</p>
<p>i guess there&rsquo;s certain factors in¬†
your your microbes that actually¬†¬†</p>
<p>protect you when you lose those it can create¬†
an imbalance um so actually these screens are¬†¬†</p>
<p>are not too healthy i have to tell you they are¬†
using these vegetable or fruit-based juices right¬†¬†</p>
<p>and and while they are doing this they¬†
are not eating the the right foods¬†¬†</p>
<p>so the combination is what is resulting in a¬†
deterioration of the conditions and also if you¬†¬†</p>
<p>have an already existing disease it is very likely¬†
that you have certain nutrient deficiencies if you¬†¬†</p>
<p>start doing fasting or juicing which is something¬†
very similar then your nutrients will be further¬†¬†</p>
<p>depleted and and you may end up in a in a¬†
condition that is worse than the original ones¬†¬†</p>
<p>wow wow this has been awesome go ahead no really¬†
there is no no need for overcomplicating things¬†¬†</p>
<p>you just have to follow the right diet and then¬†
you do not have to take away anything you you¬†¬†</p>
<p>shouldn&rsquo;t add anything once you are back to¬†
the diet that is right uh designed for you¬†¬†</p>
<p>then that is the way to go and people are obsessed¬†
with different uh you know techniques and um¬†¬†</p>
<p>approaches that that sound good at the level¬†
of the world but that in in reality they they¬†¬†</p>
<p>usually do not work i totally agree well¬†
i want to thank you so much for uh giving¬†¬†</p>
<p>me this valuable data and giving everyone¬†
else this very amazing new viewpoint i think¬†¬†</p>
<p>what i&rsquo;m going to do is i want to put some links¬†
down below of your your website and how people can¬†¬†</p>
<p>get a hold of you and as well as maybe i&rsquo;ll even¬†
put a link down for that test so people can get¬†¬†</p>
<p>more information about that test as well i will¬†
send it to you thank you very much oh thank you</p>
