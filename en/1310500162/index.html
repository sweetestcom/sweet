    <p>The following is a conversation with Zev Weinstein,</p>
<p>a young man with a brilliant, bold and hopeful mind</p>
<p>that I had the great fortune of talking to</p>
<p>on a recent afternoon.</p>
<p>He happens to be Eric Weinstein&rsquo;s son,</p>
<p>but I invited Zev not because of that,</p>
<p>but because I got a chance to listen to him speak</p>
<p>on a few occasions and was captivated</p>
<p>by how deeply he thought about this world</p>
<p>at such a young age.</p>
<p>And I thought that it might be fun</p>
<p>to explore this world of ours together with him</p>
<p>for a time through this conversation.</p>
<p>Quick mention of our sponsors.</p>
<p>ExpressVPN, Grammarly Grammar Assistant,</p>
<p>Simply Safe Home Security,</p>
<p>and Magic Spoon Low Carb Cereal.</p>

<p>Choose wisely, my friends.</p>

<p>As a side note, let me say that Zev acknowledges</p>
<p>the fear associated with participating in public discourse</p>
<p>and is brave enough to join in at a young age,</p>
<p>to push forward, to change his mind publicly,</p>
<p>to learn, to articulate difficult nuanced ideas</p>
<p>and grow from the conversations that follow.</p>
<p>In this, I hope he leads the next generation of minds</p>
<p>that is joining and steering the collective intelligence</p>
<p>of this big ant colony we think of</p>
<p>as our human civilization.</p>

<p>And now, here&rsquo;s my conversation with Zev Weinstein.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve said that philosophy becomes more dangerous</p>
<p>in difficult times.</p>
<p>What do you mean by that?</p>
<p>Interestingly, I think I mean two things by that.</p>
<p>And I think firstly, I should clarify,</p>
<p>when I say philosophy, I sort of mean</p>
<p>in a very traditional sense, just thinking, ideation.</p>
<p>And that could be reconsidering our notions of self</p>
<p>in a very traditional sense, which we consider philosophy,</p>
<p>or that could be like technological innovation.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s important to recognize all of these</p>
<p>as philosophies that we can not question</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s important to promote thought.</p>
<p>I think the other thing I should clarify</p>
<p>is when I say difficult times,</p>
<p>I mean times when nothing is growing,</p>
<p>and so the risk for real conflict is much greater</p>
<p>because people are incentivized to fight over the things</p>
<p>which already exist.</p>
<p>I think when times are not difficult,</p>
<p>the people with the greatest power</p>
<p>are usually the people who are very creative,</p>
<p>generating a lot, and that really requires ideation</p>
<p>or philosophy of some sort.</p>
<p>I think when times become stagnant,</p>
<p>the important successful people become the people</p>
<p>who are very good at protecting their own pieces of the pie</p>
<p>and taking others.</p>
<p>I think that those people have to be very opposed</p>
<p>to any sort of thinking that could restructure society</p>
<p>or conventions about who should succeed.</p>
<p>And so firstly, I mean by that</p>
<p>that it becomes much more dangerous for a person</p>
<p>to think deeply and question during a time</p>
<p>when the important people are those concerned</p>
<p>with making sure no one rocks the boat.</p>
<p>One example of this would be Socrates and his execution</p>
<p>because everyone was happy enough</p>
<p>to sit through his questions before there was war</p>
<p>and poverty and distress,</p>
<p>and afterwards it just became too dangerous.</p>
<p>The other thing I mean by that is that the consequences</p>
<p>of thinking deeply carry much greater potential</p>
<p>for real catastrophe when everyone is desperate.</p>
<p>So like for example, the communist manifesto</p>
<p>was probably much more dangerous during early 1900s Russia</p>
<p>than it was during the 1848 revolutions</p>
<p>because I think people were in much worse shape</p>
<p>and desperate people are very willing to dive</p>
<p>into anything new that might bring the future</p>
<p>without fully calculating</p>
<p>whatever the consequences or risks might be.</p>
<p>So it is both more dangerous for a person</p>
<p>to have creative ideas and those ideas</p>
<p>are more dangerous when times are tough.</p>
<p>And by dangerous you mean it challenges the people</p>
<p>with power who want to maintain that power</p>
<p>in times of stagnation when there&rsquo;s not much growth,</p>
<p>innovation, creativity, all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Right, and we know that if nothing new is created,</p>
<p>people have promises that they&rsquo;ve made</p>
<p>about what will be paid to whom, what debt structure is.</p>
<p>The only possibility if stagnation lasts for long enough</p>
<p>is really some kind of great conflict, great war</p>
<p>because people have to take from others</p>
<p>to make good on their own promises.</p>
<p>So we know that by denying any sort of grand ideation</p>
<p>we are accepting that there will be</p>
<p>some kind of great catastrophe.</p>
<p>And so we have to understand that philosophy</p>
<p>is the most important when we&rsquo;ve seen</p>
<p>too much stagnation for too long.</p>
<p>It is also very dangerous</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s dangerous for the people who are doing it</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s dangerous for the people who believe it</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s kind of our only way out ever.</p>
<p>And again, by philosophy you mean the bigger,</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s not academic philosophy</p>
<p>or this kind of games played in the space</p>
<p>of just like moral philosophy and all those metaphysics,</p>
<p>all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>You mean just thinking deeply about this world,</p>
<p>thinking from first principles.</p>
<p>I think your like Twitter line involves something about like.</p>
<p>Trying to piece everything together from first principles.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s fundamentally what being philosophical</p>
<p>about this world is and that&rsquo;s where the people</p>
<p>who are thinking deeply about this world</p>
<p>are the ones who are feeding,</p>
<p>who are the catalyst of this growth in society and so on.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, I also think that the real implication</p>
<p>of moral philosophy can be something</p>
<p>that most would consider like a real political implication.</p>
<p>So I think all philosophy really ties together</p>
<p>because there has to be some sort of grand structure</p>
<p>to all thought and how it relates.</p>
<p>Do you think this growth and innovation</p>
<p>and improvement can last forever?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve seen some incredible,</p>
<p>the thing that humans have been able to accomplish</p>
<p>over the past several hundred years is just,</p>
<p>I mean, awe inspiring and every moment in that history,</p>
<p>it almost seemed like no more could be done.</p>
<p>Like we&rsquo;ve solved all the problems that are to be solved.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s just historically,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s all these kind of ridiculous</p>
<p>like Bill Gates style quotes,</p>
<p>or like it&rsquo;s obvious that this new cool thing</p>
<p>is not gonna take off and yet it does.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s a feeling of the same kind of pattern</p>
<p>that we see in Moore&rsquo;s law.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s constant growth in different technologies</p>
<p>in the modern day era in any kind of automation</p>
<p>over the past hundred years.</p>
<p>Do you think it&rsquo;s possible that we&rsquo;ll keep growing this way</p>
<p>if we give power to the philosophers of our society?</p>
<p>I think the only way that we can keep growing this way</p>
<p>is if we give power to real thinkers.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s no guarantee that that will work,</p>
<p>but we sort of don&rsquo;t have any other choice.</p>
<p>And I think you&rsquo;re entirely right</p>
<p>that this period of both understanding the universe</p>
<p>at a rate which has never been seen before</p>
<p>and invention and creativity,</p>
<p>that these past hundred years</p>
<p>have been sort of uncharacteristic</p>
<p>for the level of growth that we&rsquo;ve seen in all of history.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve never seen anything like this.</p>
<p>And I think a lot of our promises rest on this sort of thing</p>
<p>continuing.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s very dangerous.</p>
<p>But the one thing that can get us out of this is philosophy</p>
<p>and being ready to radically restructure</p>
<p>all of our notions about what should be, what is.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s very important.</p>
<p>So you think deeply about this world.</p>
<p>You are clearly the embodiment of a thinker, of a philosopher.</p>
<p>Your dad is also one such guy, Eric Weinstein.</p>
<p>Do you have big disagreements with him</p>
<p>on this topic in particular?</p>
<p>I think, now people should know,</p>
<p>he also happens to be in the room,</p>
<p>but the mics can&rsquo;t pick him up so he can heckle.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t even matter.</p>
<p>But do you have disagreements with him on this point?</p>
<p>Let me try to summarize his argument</p>
<p>that we are actually based a lot of our American society</p>
<p>on the belief that things will keep growing.</p>
<p>And yet it seems that however you break it apart,</p>
<p>maybe from an economics perspective,</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re not growing currently.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s where a lot of our troubles are at.</p>
<p>Do you have the same sense that there&rsquo;s a stagnation period</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re living through over the past couple of decades?</p>
<p>I think stagnation, modern stagnation is completely</p>
<p>undeniable, particularly scientifically.</p>
<p>And I think there have been a few fields</p>
<p>where tremendous progress has been made very recently.</p>
<p>I think my dad might feel that</p>
<p>there is sort of an inevitability</p>
<p>to the ending of this period.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not so certain that the fall of this great time</p>
<p>is completely inevitable because I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>what thoughts we&rsquo;re capable of producing,</p>
<p>what we&rsquo;re able to reconsider.</p>
<p>I think we really have to be open to the possibility</p>
<p>that all of our standard frameworks where,</p>
<p>like he will talk about embedded growth obligations.</p>
<p>If we continue within the same framework,</p>
<p>then we&rsquo;re very susceptible to the dangers</p>
<p>of whatever these embedded growth obligations are.</p>
<p>I think if we break the frameworks,</p>
<p>we have no reason to believe that the problems</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re experiencing with our current frameworks</p>
<p>will follow us.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s the importance of radical thought</p>
<p>is we don&rsquo;t know what the solution is,</p>
<p>but if there is a solution,</p>
<p>it will be born from some very fundamental thinking.</p>
<p>And so I have great hope.</p>
<p>So you have optimism about sort of the power</p>
<p>of a single radical idea or a single radical thinker</p>
<p>to break our frameworks and break us out of this,</p>
<p>like, spiral down due to whatever the economic forces</p>
<p>that are creating this current stagnation.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m very, very hopeful.</p>
<p>The optimism of youth.</p>
<p>Well, I share your optimism.</p>
<p>So let me come back to something you&rsquo;ve also talked about.</p>
<p>You have very little stuff out there currently,</p>
<p>but the things you have out there, your thoughts,</p>
<p>you could just tell how deeply you think about this world.</p>
<p>And one of the things you mentioned is</p>
<p>as you learn about this world, as you read,</p>
<p>as you sort of go through different experiences,</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re open to changing your mind.</p>
<p>How often do you find yourself changing your mind?</p>
<p>Do you think Zev from 10 years into the future</p>
<p>will look back at this conversation we&rsquo;re having now</p>
<p>and disagree completely with everything you just said?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s entirely possible.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s one of the things that scares me so much</p>
<p>about appearing publicly.</p>
<p>I think that the internet can be very intolerant</p>
<p>of inconsistency.</p>
<p>And I am entirely prepared to be very inconsistent</p>
<p>because I know that whatever beliefs I have</p>
<p>when subjected to scrutiny may change</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s really the only way</p>
<p>to form your truest, most fundamental conceptions</p>
<p>about the world around you.</p>
<p>And it would take an infinite amount of time</p>
<p>to subject every single one of your beliefs to scrutiny.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s a process that must follow me</p>
<p>throughout my entire life.</p>
<p>And I know that means that my opinions and perspectives</p>
<p>are always to be changing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m prepared to accept that about myself.</p>
<p>Whether other people are prepared to accept</p>
<p>that my public opinions may change</p>
<p>and vary greatly over time is something I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how tolerant the world will be,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m very prepared to change anything I believe in</p>
<p>if I think deeply enough about it</p>
<p>or a good enough argument is made so that I might reconsider.</p>
<p>Well, there certainly is currently an intolerance</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s one of the problems of our age.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an intolerance towards change.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll also ask you about labels.</p>
<p>You talked about sort of we like to bin each other</p>
<p>into different categories, the blue or red</p>
<p>or whatever the different categorization is.</p>
<p>But it seems like the task before you</p>
<p>as a young person defining our future</p>
<p>is to make a tolerance of change the norm.</p>
<p>Doing this podcast, for example,</p>
<p>and then changing your mind one or two years later</p>
<p>and doing so publicly without a big dramatic thing</p>
<p>or maybe changing it on a daily basis</p>
<p>and just being open about it and being transparent</p>
<p>about your thought process.</p>
<p>Maybe that is the beacon of hope for the philosophical way,</p>
<p>the path of the philosopher.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s your task in a sense</p>
<p>is to change your mind openly and bravely.</p>
<p>You know, you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>And maybe I will just have to endure some sort of criticism</p>
<p>for doing that, but I think that&rsquo;s very important.</p>
<p>I think this ties back to this previous facet</p>
<p>of our conversation where we were discussing</p>
<p>if thinkers would win over systems</p>
<p>that are devoted to preventing radical thought</p>
<p>or if who will win the systems or the thinkers.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s crucial that my generation</p>
<p>take up a hand in this fight.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s important that I&rsquo;m a part of that</p>
<p>because I know that I have some opportunity</p>
<p>to, there is, I think it is my obligation</p>
<p>as a member of a generation whose only real hope</p>
<p>is to think outside of a system</p>
<p>because whatever systems exist are collapsing.</p>
<p>I think it is really my obligation</p>
<p>to try to play some role, whatever role I can</p>
<p>and being an instrument in that change.</p>
<p>Are you, as a young mind, do you have a sense of fear</p>
<p>about just like how afraid were you</p>
<p>to do this podcast conversation?</p>
<p>Do you have a sense of fear of thinking publicly?</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t even think that that fear is irrational.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very difficult to exist publicly in any form now</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s very easy for anyone to take cheap shots</p>
<p>at something which is difficult and as I said,</p>
<p>the people who are trying to have the difficult ideas</p>
<p>and conversations are perhaps putting others</p>
<p>in actual danger because everyone is so desperate</p>
<p>that they might be willing to try anything.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a certain amount of responsibility</p>
<p>which one has to take going before the public</p>
<p>and there is a certain amount of ridicule</p>
<p>which will be completely unwarranted</p>
<p>that anyone must endure for it.</p>
<p>And I think that means that one has to be afraid</p>
<p>because they could both ruin the world</p>
<p>and be ruined by the world</p>
<p>in an unwarranted and undeserved fashion.</p>
<p>I would like to believe in myself enough</p>
<p>to try to accept this as a task</p>
<p>because I think people need to try</p>
<p>or there&rsquo;s no getting out of this</p>
<p>and we will end in some kind of crazy, brilliant war.</p>
<p>Awfully put.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve said also that in these times we can&rsquo;t have labels</p>
<p>because it holds us back.</p>
<p>Maybe we&rsquo;ve already talked about it a little bit</p>
<p>but this idea of labels is really interesting.</p>
<p>Why do you think labels hold us back?</p>
<p>Well, I think many underestimate the extent</p>
<p>to which language and communication really impacts</p>
<p>and shapes the ideas and thoughts</p>
<p>which are being communicated.</p>
<p>And I think if we&rsquo;re willing to accept imperfect labels</p>
<p>to categorize particular people or thoughts,</p>
<p>in some sense, we are corrupting an abstraction</p>
<p>in order to represent it and communicate about it.</p>
<p>And I think as we&rsquo;ve discussed,</p>
<p>those abstractions are particularly important</p>
<p>when everything is on fire.</p>
<p>We should not be sacrificing grand thoughts</p>
<p>for the ability to express it.</p>
<p>I think everyone should work much harder,</p>
<p>including myself, to really be thinking abstractly</p>
<p>in abstract terms instead of using concrete terms</p>
<p>to discuss abstraction while ruining it slightly.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s kind of a skill actually.</p>
<p>So one really difficult example in the recent time</p>
<p>that maybe you can comment on if you have been thinking</p>
<p>about it is just politics.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a lot of labels in politics</p>
<p>that it takes a lot of skill to be able</p>
<p>to communicate difficult ideas</p>
<p>without labels being attached to you.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s something that I&rsquo;ve been sort of thinking about a lot</p>
<p>in trying to express, for example,</p>
<p>how much I love various aspects of the foundational ideas</p>
<p>of this country, like freedom,</p>
<p>and just saying, I love America, a simple statement.</p>
<p>I love the ideas that we&rsquo;re finding to America.</p>
<p>Well, often in the current time,</p>
<p>well, people will try, they desperately try</p>
<p>to attach a label to me, for example,</p>
<p>for saying I love America, that I&rsquo;m a Republican,</p>
<p>a Donald Trump supporter, and it takes elegance</p>
<p>and grace and skill to avoid those labels</p>
<p>so that people can actually listen</p>
<p>to the contents of your words</p>
<p>versus the summarization that results</p>
<p>from just the labels that they can pin on you.</p>
<p>Are you cognizant of the skill required there</p>
<p>of being able to communicate</p>
<p>without being branded a Republican or a Democrat</p>
<p>in this particular set of conversations?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s other dangerous labels</p>
<p>that could be attached.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s any way of avoiding that right now.</p>
<p>It might not be anyone&rsquo;s best effort to really try.</p>
<p>I think the thing I can say, which will most speak to that,</p>
<p>which I truly believe, is that participating</p>
<p>in modern conventional politics</p>
<p>is not being inherently political</p>
<p>in a generative sense.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s this repeated trope where politics now</p>
<p>is not about creating new political ideologies.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about defending ideologies which already exist</p>
<p>so that everyone can keep what they have.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where all of the name calling</p>
<p>and the labeling really comes in.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an attempt to constrict whatever may be generated</p>
<p>to standard conversations and discussions</p>
<p>so that arguments can be straw manned and defeated</p>
<p>and people can keep what they have</p>
<p>because everyone&rsquo;s very, very scared.</p>
<p>I want to be very political,</p>
<p>but not in a standard political sense</p>
<p>where I&rsquo;m defending a particular party</p>
<p>or place on a spectrum.</p>
<p>I would like to play some role in inventing new spectrums</p>
<p>and I think that&rsquo;s most important politically</p>
<p>because above most else, politics is about real power</p>
<p>and conventional politicians have real power</p>
<p>and that power will find terrible outlets</p>
<p>if new spectrums for that power to live are not invented.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re not afraid of politics.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re afraid of political discourse at the deepest,</p>
<p>richest level of what political discourse is supposed to mean.</p>
<p>Actually, I&rsquo;m very afraid of it, but once again, we have no.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not paralyzing for you.</p>
<p>You feel like it&rsquo;s a responsibility,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re ready to take it on.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>This is a good sign.</p>
<p>This is, you&rsquo;re a special human.</p>
<p>Okay, let&rsquo;s talk maybe fun, maybe profound.</p>
<p>We talked about philosophers, philosophy.</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s your favorite philosopher?</p>
<p>Like somebody in your current time but neither influential</p>
<p>or you just enjoy his, her ideas</p>
<p>or writing or anything like that?</p>
<p>Weirdly, I&rsquo;ll give an answer</p>
<p>which sort of doesn&rsquo;t have much to do</p>
<p>with whom I might imagine myself to be.</p>
<p>I like Thomas Aquinas at the moment.</p>
<p>I think he&rsquo;s very inspirational to me</p>
<p>given what we&rsquo;re going through</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s not because his particular ideas</p>
<p>of religion or God or unmoved movers</p>
<p>are particularly inspirational to me</p>
<p>and I don&rsquo;t even think they were necessarily right.</p>
<p>But he was introducing aspects of the scientific method</p>
<p>during one of the darkest periods in human history</p>
<p>when we had lost all hope and reason</p>
<p>and ability to think logically.</p>
<p>So I think he was really something of a light in the dark</p>
<p>and I think we need to look to people like that</p>
<p>at the moment.</p>
<p>The other reason why I think I need to learn from him</p>
<p>is that even though he was doing something</p>
<p>which really needed to be done</p>
<p>and introducing scientific thought and reason</p>
<p>to a time that lacked it,</p>
<p>he was not saying anything that would have been offensive</p>
<p>to whatever powers were in play during his time.</p>
<p>He was writing about the importance of faith in God</p>
<p>and how we could prove it.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s important to remember, I suppose,</p>
<p>that having ideas that shape the world</p>
<p>and which bring the world closer to what we can prove</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s supposed to be and how it&rsquo;s supposed to work</p>
<p>does not always take some sort of grand contradiction</p>
<p>of whatever&rsquo;s in play.</p>
<p>And the most courageous thing to do</p>
<p>may not always be the most helpful thing to do.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s very easy for anyone with ideas</p>
<p>about how everything is broken to become very cynical</p>
<p>and say, oh, the system, man, they&rsquo;re all wrong.</p>
<p>I think it takes another kind of discipline</p>
<p>to be a person with real ideas</p>
<p>and to make the world better</p>
<p>without stepping on anyone&rsquo;s toes or contradicting anyone.</p>
<p>I have real respect for that.</p>
<p>So being able to be,</p>
<p>when it&rsquo;s within your principles to operate,</p>
<p>within the current system of thought.</p>
<p>Yeah, and not offend anyone, not say anything outlandish,</p>
<p>but introduce the method</p>
<p>by which progress must be achieved.</p>
<p>I think that takes a kind of maturity,</p>
<p>which is found very rarely now.</p>
<p>And I really look to him for inspiration</p>
<p>despite whatever disagreements I may have</p>
<p>with the minute details of his philosophy.</p>
<p>Yeah, it takes a lot of skill, a lot of character,</p>
<p>and yeah, deep thinking to be able to operate</p>
<p>within the system when needed</p>
<p>and having the fortitude and just the boldness</p>
<p>to step outside and to burn the system down when needed,</p>
<p>but rarely, and opportune moments</p>
<p>that would actually have impact.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s ultimately about impact</p>
<p>within the society that you live in,</p>
<p>not just making a statement that has no impact.</p>
<p>Yeah, and we were talking about how dangerous it is</p>
<p>to do real philosophy at dangerous broken times.</p>
<p>He was going through the most broken time in history</p>
<p>and he questioned the methods</p>
<p>which made a broken system able to survive.</p>
<p>And he was so skilled and so graceful</p>
<p>that he became a saint in that tradition.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s something for me to really learn from there.</p>
<p>Do you draw any inspiration,</p>
<p>have any interest in the sort of more modern philosophers,</p>
<p>maybe the existentialists?</p>
<p>I mean, Nietzsche is one of the early ones.</p>
<p>Do you have thoughts on the guy in general</p>
<p>or any of the other existentialists?</p>
<p>Well, with regard to Nietzsche,</p>
<p>I think Yates might&rsquo;ve said that he&rsquo;s the worst.</p>
<p>He was certainly filled with passionate intensity.</p>
<p>I think&hellip;</p>
<p>Was that a compliment?</p>
<p>He was the worst or a criticism or both?</p>
<p>Yates had this big line,</p>
<p>that the best lack all conviction,</p>
<p>the worst are filled with passionate intensity.</p>
<p>So I think Nietzsche was destroyed</p>
<p>by the horrors of everything that went on around him.</p>
<p>And I think he never really recovered from it.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s because if you think about Nietzsche&rsquo;s</p>
<p>philosophy, he was very opposed to any sort of acceptance</p>
<p>of what one had.</p>
<p>One should always envy those who have more</p>
<p>and use that envy to fuel their ideas.</p>
<p>To fuel their growth and accept whatever</p>
<p>the human condition and desires are</p>
<p>and use those desires to want more and more</p>
<p>and make use of your greed.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s very difficult to be truly happy</p>
<p>if the thing which you pride yourself most on</p>
<p>is never being satisfied.</p>
<p>And I think Nietzsche was never satisfied</p>
<p>and that was the danger of his philosophy.</p>
<p>I think also with his amoralism,</p>
<p>there is no good or evil.</p>
<p>I sort of disagree with that on a pretty fundamental basis.</p>
<p>I think that our notion of morality</p>
<p>is by no means subjective.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really the proxy for the fitness of a society.</p>
<p>I think whatever we consider ethical,</p>
<p>like don&rsquo;t steal, don&rsquo;t murder, don&rsquo;t do this,</p>
<p>societies have a very difficult time running.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very hard to run a civilization</p>
<p>when everyone is stealing from everyone else</p>
<p>and people are murdering each other</p>
<p>and committing these things,</p>
<p>which we would consider atrocities.</p>
<p>So I think we also, we know this</p>
<p>because I think very similar notions of morality</p>
<p>have evolved convergently from different traditions.</p>
<p>I think good is a proxy for a civilization&rsquo;s fitness</p>
<p>and the good news is that that means that evil</p>
<p>in being anathema to that good</p>
<p>must therefore be the opposite of stable</p>
<p>in whatever way that it&rsquo;s evil.</p>
<p>And that means that good will always be more stable</p>
<p>than evil and the only way evil can really win</p>
<p>is like if everyone dies.</p>
<p>So I think that&rsquo;s a good thing.</p>
<p>Everyone dies, so.</p>
<p>So wait, can you say that again?</p>
<p>Good is a proxy for society&rsquo;s what?</p>
<p>Good is a proxy for the stability</p>
<p>and fitness of a civilization and evil.</p>
<p>Damn, that&rsquo;s a good definition.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re throwing some bombs today.</p>
<p>Okay, all right.</p>
<p>Okay, this is exciting.</p>
<p>Sorry, sorry to interrupt your flow there,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s just a damn good line.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So in that sense, that&rsquo;s a kind of optimistic view</p>
<p>that if by definition good is a proxy for stability,</p>
<p>then it&rsquo;s going to be stable</p>
<p>unless the entire world just blows itself up.</p>
<p>So good wins in the end by definition.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Or no, well, good wins unless it all goes</p>
<p>to complete destruction.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s beautifully put.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>On a topic of sort of good and evil being human illusions,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve said that more broadly than that about truth,</p>
<p>that it is easier in some ways to be unified under truth</p>
<p>because it is universal than it is to be unified</p>
<p>under belief, which at times can be completely subjective.</p>
<p>So what is the nature of truth to you?</p>
<p>Can we understand the world objectively</p>
<p>or is most of what we can understand about the world</p>
<p>is just a subjective opinions</p>
<p>that we kind of all agree on in these little collectives</p>
<p>and over time it kind of evolves completely detached</p>
<p>from objective reality.</p>
<p>I think this is the greatest argument for objectivity</p>
<p>is that something that is objectively true</p>
<p>cannot be true to me and untrue to you.</p>
<p>You can feel that it&rsquo;s untrue,</p>
<p>but that would be unproductive</p>
<p>and create unnecessary tension and conflict.</p>
<p>I think this is one reason for the importance of science</p>
<p>as a tool for stability.</p>
<p>If science is the search for truth and truth can never really be,</p>
<p>I shouldn&rsquo;t say that,</p>
<p>truth should never be an engine of conflict</p>
<p>because no two people should disagree on something</p>
<p>which is objectively true,</p>
<p>then in some sense, search for truth is searching</p>
<p>for a common ground where we can all exist</p>
<p>and live without contradicting or attacking each other.</p>
<p>Do you have a hope that there is a lot of common ground</p>
<p>to be discovered?</p>
<p>Sure, I mean, if we continue scientifically,</p>
<p>we are discovering truth</p>
<p>and in that discovering common ground</p>
<p>on which we can all agree.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one reason why I think caring about science,</p>
<p>if you have a culture which cares very deeply about science,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a culture which is not necessarily bound</p>
<p>to injure unwarranted internal conflict.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s one reason that I&rsquo;m so passionate</p>
<p>about science is it&rsquo;s search for universal ground.</p>
<p>Let me just throw out an example</p>
<p>of a modern day philosophical thinker.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll keep your dad, Eric Weinstein out of the picture</p>
<p>for a sec, but he does happen to be an example of one,</p>
<p>but Jordan Peterson is an example of another,</p>
<p>somebody who thinks deeply about this world.</p>
<p>His ideas are by a certain percent of the population,</p>
<p>sort of speaking of truth, are labeled as dangerous.</p>
<p>Why do you think his ideas</p>
<p>or just ideas of these kinds of deep thinkers in general</p>
<p>are labeled as dangerous in our modern world?</p>
<p>Is it similar to what you&rsquo;ve been discussing</p>
<p>that in difficult times, philosophers become dangerous?</p>
<p>Or is there something specific</p>
<p>about these particular thinkers in our time?</p>
<p>Well, I think Jordan Peterson is very anti establishment</p>
<p>in a lot of his beliefs.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s an unconventional thinker.</p>
<p>And I think we need, regardless of whatever</p>
<p>Jordan&rsquo;s particular views and beliefs are,</p>
<p>and if they bring about more danger than truth,</p>
<p>or if they don&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s very important</p>
<p>to have fundamental thinkers</p>
<p>who exist outside of a conventional framework.</p>
<p>So do I think that he&rsquo;s dangerous?</p>
<p>I think by existing outside of a system which is known,</p>
<p>he is dangerous.</p>
<p>And I think we have to, in some sense,</p>
<p>in some sense, we have to welcome danger in that capacity</p>
<p>because it will be our only way out of this.</p>
<p>So regardless of whether his beliefs are right or wrong,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pretty adamant about the fact</p>
<p>that we need to support thought which may rescue us.</p>
<p>And that thought can appear radical or dangerous at times.</p>
<p>But ultimately, if you allow for it,</p>
<p>this is kind of the difficult discussion of free speech</p>
<p>and so on, is ultimately difficult ideas</p>
<p>will pave the way for progress.</p>
<p>Yeah, and I&rsquo;d actually, I&rsquo;d like to slow you down there</p>
<p>because I think like one of the issues</p>
<p>we were discussing previously was the fact</p>
<p>that language often destroys our ability to think.</p>
<p>When we&rsquo;re talking about whether his ideas are radical,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if we mean radical in the traditional sense</p>
<p>of having to do with the root of a problem</p>
<p>or in the more modern sense of being very extreme.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s completely by design,</p>
<p>I think fundamental thought,</p>
<p>which semantically would once be considered radical thought</p>
<p>became very dangerous.</p>
<p>And now it&rsquo;s become synonymous with extreme</p>
<p>or dangerous thought, which means that anyone</p>
<p>who considers themselves a radical thinker</p>
<p>is semantically also a dangerous or extreme thinker.</p>
<p>These are not helpful labels in a sense</p>
<p>that the moment you say radical or extremist thinker,</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re just, well, how do I put it?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not helping the public discourse, exchange of ideas.</p>
<p>But through no fault of our own,</p>
<p>the concept of radical as having to do with a root</p>
<p>is it&rsquo;s an obvious concept for which there must be language</p>
<p>and a lot of the attack on thought has to do</p>
<p>with attacking language, which communicates conceptually.</p>
<p>So like this is an example of how our world</p>
<p>is becoming increasingly Orwellian.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just language is being used to destroy</p>
<p>our ability to think.</p>
<p>I think I can&rsquo;t remember exactly what the numbers are,</p>
<p>but I read some statistic about how greatly</p>
<p>the average English vocabulary has been used</p>
<p>and the vocabulary has decreased since 1960.</p>
<p>It was like some incredible number.</p>
<p>It really baffled me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, how are people less able to think in a time</p>
<p>when the world is supposed to be growing</p>
<p>at a never before seen rate?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, we can&rsquo;t keep on, we can&rsquo;t sustain this growth</p>
<p>if we destroy everyone&rsquo;s ability to think</p>
<p>because the growth requires thinking</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re ruining the tools for it.</p>
<p>I watched your podcast with Noam Chomsky</p>
<p>and I think one interesting thing which he discussed</p>
<p>was how language is more used to develop thoughts</p>
<p>within our own head than it is used to communicate</p>
<p>those thoughts with others.</p>
<p>If the language doesn&rsquo;t change, even if its usage changes,</p>
<p>when language is destroyed in communication,</p>
<p>it also stymies our ability to think reasonably</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m very, very worried.</p>
<p>But the language in communication requires a medium</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a lot of different mediums.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s social media, there&rsquo;s Twitter,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s writing books, there&rsquo;s blog posts,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s podcasts, there&rsquo;s YouTube videos,</p>
<p>all of things you have dipped a toe in</p>
<p>in your exploration of different mediums of communication.</p>
<p>Which do you see yourself, this might be just a poetic way</p>
<p>of asking are you gonna do a podcast,</p>
<p>but broader picture, what do you think as an intellectual</p>
<p>in this world for you personally</p>
<p>would be the path for communicating your ideas to the world?</p>
<p>What are the mediums you are currently drawn to</p>
<p>out of the ones I mentioned or maybe something I didn&rsquo;t?</p>
<p>To answer your question concretely before abstractly,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m scared but I need to do a podcast.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important, it is my obligation</p>
<p>as a member of my generation.</p>
<p>I really hope that more people my age start to do this</p>
<p>because we will be the people in charge of new ideas</p>
<p>which either sink or swim.</p>
<p>How upset will your dad be</p>
<p>when your podcast quickly becomes more popular than his?</p>
<p>I think he would be negatively upset.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll say he&rsquo;d be proud, he&rsquo;s a good dad.</p>
<p>I really think so, yeah.</p>
<p>Sorry to interrupt.</p>
<p>Yeah, so but then zooming out, do you think podcasts,</p>
<p>are you excited by the possibility</p>
<p>of other mediums outside of podcasting to communicate ideas?</p>
<p>I would be if people still read books</p>
<p>or did things like that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m somewhat guilty of this.</p>
<p>A lot of the books I read are very technical</p>
<p>and then my, to absorb like really deep modern conversations</p>
<p>I listen to podcasts and I don&rsquo;t really read many books</p>
<p>on like the matters that we&rsquo;re discussing, for example.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fascinating because you&rsquo;re making me think</p>
<p>of something that I align with you very much</p>
<p>of how I consume deep thinkers currently.</p>
<p>So what happens is somebody who thinks deeply</p>
<p>about the world will write a book, Jordan Peterson example,</p>
<p>and instead of reading their book,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just listen to podcast conversations</p>
<p>of them talking about the book, which I find to,</p>
<p>this is really sad, but I find that to be</p>
<p>a more compelling way to think about their ideas</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re often challenged in certain ways</p>
<p>in those conversations and they&rsquo;re forced to,</p>
<p>after having boiled them down and really thought</p>
<p>through them enough to write a book.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s almost like they needed to go through the process</p>
<p>of writing a book just so they could think through,</p>
<p>convert the language in their minds</p>
<p>into something more concrete,</p>
<p>and then the actual exchange of ideas,</p>
<p>the actual communication of ideas with the public happens</p>
<p>not with the book, but after the book,</p>
<p>with that person going on a book tour</p>
<p>and communicating the ideas.</p>
<p>Well, there are two meanings I make</p>
<p>of why not too many people spend much</p>
<p>of their time reading anymore.</p>
<p>One interpretation is that we&rsquo;ve lost our attention spans</p>
<p>to our phones, people can&rsquo;t concentrate on a page</p>
<p>if it takes them a minute to read,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re too busy watching TikToks or whatever people do.</p>
<p>The other interpretation would be that language</p>
<p>and verbal communication has,</p>
<p>as well as some amount of communication,</p>
<p>which is done through facial expression,</p>
<p>tone of voice, et cetera.</p>
<p>These are means of communication</p>
<p>that have evolved along with humanity</p>
<p>over thousands and thousands of years.</p>
<p>So we know that we are built to communicate in this way.</p>
<p>We have had writing for much less time.</p>
<p>It is a system that we invented,</p>
<p>not a system which evolved and is innately part</p>
<p>of humanity or the human mind.</p>
<p>And so we are designed to consume conversation</p>
<p>by our own evolution.</p>
<p>We are designed to consume writing</p>
<p>by some process of symbols</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s evolved over a couple of thousand years.</p>
<p>It makes sense to me why many are much more compelled</p>
<p>to listen to podcasts, for example,</p>
<p>than they are to read books.</p>
<p>It could be that this is simply a technological progression</p>
<p>which has displaced reading conventionally</p>
<p>instead of some sort of maladaptation of our minds,</p>
<p>which has corrupted our attention spans.</p>
<p>Likely there&rsquo;s some combination</p>
<p>which determines why people spend much less time reading.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s necessarily because we&rsquo;re all broken.</p>
<p>It may simply have to do with the fact</p>
<p>that we are designed to listen through our ears</p>
<p>and speak through our mouths.</p>
<p>And we are not innately designed to communicate over a page.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s an exciting coupling to me</p>
<p>between like few second TikTok videos</p>
<p>that are fun and addicting,</p>
<p>and then the three, four hour podcasts,</p>
<p>which are both really popular in our current time.</p>
<p>So people are both hungry for the visual stimulation</p>
<p>of internet humor and memes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a huge fan of, and also slow moving deep conversations.</p>
<p>And that might, you know, there&rsquo;s a lot of,</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s part of your generation</p>
<p>to define what that looks like moving forward.</p>
<p>There were a lot of people, like Joe Rogan&rsquo;s</p>
<p>one of the people that kind of started,</p>
<p>accidentally stumbled into the discovery</p>
<p>that this is like a thing.</p>
<p>And now people are kind of scrambling to figure out</p>
<p>why is this a thing?</p>
<p>Like, why is there so much hunger</p>
<p>for long form conversations?</p>
<p>And how do we optimize that medium</p>
<p>for further, further expression of deep ideas</p>
<p>and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>And YouTube is a really interesting medium</p>
<p>for that as well.</p>
<p>Like video, sharing of videos,</p>
<p>mostly YouTube is used with a spirit of like</p>
<p>the TikTok spirit, if I can put it in that way,</p>
<p>which is like, how do I have quick moving things</p>
<p>that even if you&rsquo;re expressing difficult ideas,</p>
<p>they should be quick and exciting and visual and switching.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a lot of exploration there</p>
<p>to see what can we do something deeper</p>
<p>and nobody knows.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re part of the, you have a YouTube channel</p>
<p>releasing one video every few years.</p>
<p>So, so your momentum is currently quite slow,</p>
<p>but perhaps it&rsquo;ll accelerate.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re one of the people that gets to define that medium.</p>
<p>Is that, do you enjoy that, the visual YouTube medium</p>
<p>of communication as well?</p>
<p>I know that when the topic of conversation</p>
<p>or the means by which a conversation is communicated</p>
<p>or an idea is communicated,</p>
<p>if that is sufficiently interesting to me,</p>
<p>I will read a book on it.</p>
<p>I would listen to a podcast on it.</p>
<p>I would watch a video on it.</p>
<p>I think if I&rsquo;m very curious about something,</p>
<p>I will consume it however possible.</p>
<p>I think when I have to consume things</p>
<p>which really don&rsquo;t interest me very much,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m indeed much more ready to consume them</p>
<p>through some sort of video or discussion</p>
<p>than I am through like a long tedious book.</p>
<p>So for the breadth of acquiring knowledge,</p>
<p>video is good.</p>
<p>For the depth, the medium doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;d be fun to ask you about</p>
<p>some big philosophical questions</p>
<p>to see if you have an opinion on them.</p>
<p>Do you think there&rsquo;s a free will</p>
<p>or is free will just an illusion?</p>
<p>Well, I think classical mechanics would tell us</p>
<p>that if we were to know every piece of information</p>
<p>about a system and understand the rules</p>
<p>which govern that system,</p>
<p>we would be completely able to predict the future</p>
<p>with complete accuracy.</p>
<p>So if something could know everything about our lives,</p>
<p>it could freeze time and understand the position</p>
<p>of every neuron in my mind about to fire,</p>
<p>no decision could be unpredictable.</p>
<p>In some sense, there is that sort of fate.</p>
<p>I think that doesn&rsquo;t make the decisions we make illegitimate</p>
<p>even if some grand supercomputer could</p>
<p>understand what decisions we would make beforehand</p>
<p>with complete certainty.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re making legitimate systems</p>
<p>within a system that has no freedom.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re making legitimate systems</p>
<p>within a system that has no freedom.</p>
<p>Can you explain what you mean by that?</p>
<p>Yeah, so if we were to have just a simple pendulum</p>
<p>and I told you how long the rope was,</p>
<p>we froze it at a particular point</p>
<p>and I told you how high above the ground the weight was</p>
<p>and the motion of a pendulum is something</p>
<p>which is easy for everyone to imagine, I could,</p>
<p>if we had all of that information,</p>
<p>you could ask me what will the pendulum do</p>
<p>six and a half minutes from now?</p>
<p>And we would have a precise answer.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an example of a very simple system</p>
<p>with a very simple Lagrangian.</p>
<p>And we could completely predict the future.</p>
<p>The pendulum has no ability to do anything</p>
<p>that would surprise us.</p>
<p>Weirdly, that&rsquo;s true of whatever this four dimensional,</p>
<p>crazy world we live in looks like if we were to understand</p>
<p>where every piece of this system was at any given time</p>
<p>and we understand the laws of motion,</p>
<p>how everything worked,</p>
<p>if we could compute all of that information somehow,</p>
<p>which we will never be able to do,</p>
<p>we would, every decision you will ever make</p>
<p>could be predicted by that computer.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t mean that your decisions are illegitimate.</p>
<p>You are really making those decisions,</p>
<p>but with a completely predictable outcome.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m just sort of a little bit high at the moment</p>
<p>on the poetry of a system within a system</p>
<p>that has no freedom.</p>
<p>So the human experience is the system we&rsquo;ve created.</p>
<p>Within the system that has no freedom,</p>
<p>but that system that we&rsquo;ve created</p>
<p>has a feeling of freedom that, to us,</p>
<p>ants feels as much more real than the physics,</p>
<p>as we understand it, of the underlying base system.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s almost like not important</p>
<p>what the physics of the base system is,</p>
<p>that for what we&rsquo;ve created,</p>
<p>the nature of the human experience is there is a free will.</p>
<p>Or there is something that feels close enough to a free will</p>
<p>that it may not be worth spending too much time</p>
<p>on the fact that it&rsquo;s something of an illusion.</p>
<p>We will never build a computer that knows everything</p>
<p>about every piece of the universe at a given time.</p>
<p>And so for all intensive purposes,</p>
<p>our decisions are up to us.</p>
<p>We just happen to know that their outcomes</p>
<p>could be predicted with enough information.</p>
<p>So speaking of supercomputers,</p>
<p>they can predict every single thing</p>
<p>about what&rsquo;s going to ever happen.</p>
<p>What do you think about the philosophical thought experiment</p>
<p>of us living in a simulation?</p>
<p>Do you often find yourself pondering</p>
<p>of us living in a simulation of this question?</p>
<p>Do you think it is at all a useful thought experiment?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s very easy to become fascinated</p>
<p>with all of these possibilities,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re completely legitimate possibilities.</p>
<p>Is there some validity to solipsism?</p>
<p>Well, it can never be falsified or disproven.</p>
<p>So, I mean, sure, you could be a figment of my imagination.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t mean that I will act according</p>
<p>to this possibility.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not gonna call you mean names.</p>
<p>And just to test the system,</p>
<p>to see how robust it is to distortions.</p>
<p>Yeah, so, I mean, all of these existential</p>
<p>thought experiments are completely possible.</p>
<p>We could be brains in jars.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t mean that our experience will feel any less valid.</p>
<p>And so it doesn&rsquo;t make a difference to me</p>
<p>if you are some number of ones and zeros,</p>
<p>or you are a figment of my imagination,</p>
<p>which lives in a stored away brain.</p>
<p>It will never really change my experience</p>
<p>knowing that that&rsquo;s a possibility.</p>
<p>And so I try to avoid making decisions</p>
<p>based on such contemplations.</p>
<p>If we take this previous issue of free will,</p>
<p>I could decide that because I have no choice in my life,</p>
<p>if I lie around in bed all day and eat chips,</p>
<p>I was destined to do that thing.</p>
<p>And if I make that decision, then I was destined</p>
<p>to do that thing.</p>
<p>It would be a really poor decision for me to make.</p>
<p>I have school and a dozen commitments.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s somebody listening to this right now,</p>
<p>probably hundreds of people sitting down,</p>
<p>eating chips and feeling terrible about them.</p>
<p>So how dare you, sir?</p>
<p>If they&rsquo;re listening to this,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re clearly curious about possibilities of thought.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the bed and the chips that makes the man.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the bed or the chips that makes the man.</p>
<p>Yet another quotable from Zev Weinstein.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>But you don&rsquo;t think of it as a useful thought experiment</p>
<p>from an engineering perspective of virtual reality,</p>
<p>of thinking how we can create</p>
<p>further and further immersive worlds.</p>
<p>Like would it be possible to create worlds</p>
<p>that are so immersive that we would rather live</p>
<p>in that world versus the real world?</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s another possible trajectory</p>
<p>of the world that you&rsquo;re growing up in</p>
<p>is we&rsquo;re more and more immersing ourselves</p>
<p>into the digital world.</p>
<p>For now it&rsquo;s screens and looking at the screens</p>
<p>and socializing on the screens.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s possible to potentially create a world</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s also visually for all of our human senses</p>
<p>as immersive as the physical world.</p>
<p>And then, you know, to me it&rsquo;s an engineering question</p>
<p>of how difficult is it to create a world</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s as immersive and more fun</p>
<p>than the world we currently live in.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a terrifying concept and I hate to say it.</p>
<p>We might live happier lives in a virtual reality headset</p>
<p>30 years from now than we are currently living.</p>
<p>This future, the digital future, worries you.</p>
<p>It worries me.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it may be a better alternative</p>
<p>to fighting for whatever people are clinging onto</p>
<p>in our non virtual world or at least the world</p>
<p>that we don&rsquo;t yet know is virtual.</p>
<p>So embrace the future.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been talking a lot about thinkers.</p>
<p>Now, in the broad definition of philosophy,</p>
<p>you kind of included innovators of all form.</p>
<p>Do you find it useful to draw a distinction</p>
<p>between thinkers and doers?</p>
<p>I think that the most important gift we&rsquo;ve ever been given</p>
<p>is our ability to observe the universe</p>
<p>and think deductively about whatever principles,</p>
<p>transcend humanity.</p>
<p>Because as we discussed, that&rsquo;s the closest thing</p>
<p>we will ever have to a universal experience</p>
<p>is understanding things, which must be true everywhere.</p>
<p>In order for that, so I think if we&rsquo;re deciding</p>
<p>that life is meaningful and the human experience</p>
<p>is meaningful, you could make a very convincing argument</p>
<p>that its greatest meaning will be understanding</p>
<p>whatever transcends it.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s only sustainable if people are happy</p>
<p>and well fed and things of market value are invented.</p>
<p>And so I think we really need both to live meaningful</p>
<p>and successful and possible lives.</p>
<p>In terms of who my greatest heroes are,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t decide between figures like Einstein</p>
<p>and Newton and Feynman, and on the other hand,</p>
<p>figures like Carey Mullis, for example.</p>
<p>I think people like Einstein make our lives meaningful</p>
<p>and people like Carey Mullis, who&rsquo;s probably responsible</p>
<p>for saving hundreds of millions of lives,</p>
<p>make our lives possible and good.</p>
<p>So in terms of where I would like to find myself</p>
<p>with these two different notions of achievement,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what I would more like to achieve.</p>
<p>I have an inclination that it will be something scientific</p>
<p>because I would like to bring meaning to humanity</p>
<p>instead of sustenance, but I think both are very important.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t sustain our lives</p>
<p>if we don&rsquo;t keep growing technologically.</p>
<p>I think people like you are making that possible</p>
<p>with computing because that&rsquo;s one of the few things</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s really moving forward in a clear sense.</p>
<p>I think about this a great deal.</p>
<p>So I think both are very important.</p>
<p>So one example that&rsquo;s modern day inspiring figure</p>
<p>on the latter part, on the engineering part,</p>
<p>on the sustenance, is Elon Musk.</p>
<p>Does that somebody you draw inspiration from?</p>
<p>What are your thoughts in general about the kind</p>
<p>of unique spec of human that&rsquo;s creating</p>
<p>so much inspiring innovation in this world so boldly?</p>
<p>I know that we will not survive without people like that.</p>
<p>Elon is a ridiculous and sensational example</p>
<p>of one of these figures.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if he&rsquo;s the best example or the worst example,</p>
<p>but he is of his own kind.</p>
<p>He is radically individualistic,</p>
<p>and those are the people who will allow us</p>
<p>to continue as humans.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very happy that we have people like that in this world.</p>
<p>You said this thing about if we are to say</p>
<p>that life has meaning or life is meaningful,</p>
<p>then you could argue that it is a worthy pursuit</p>
<p>to transcend life.</p>
<p>Do you see that, another just, I&rsquo;m gonna have to go back</p>
<p>and sleep on that one.</p>
<p>Do you draw some, speaking of Elon,</p>
<p>some inspiration of us transcending Earth,</p>
<p>of us moving outside of this particular planet</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve called home for a long time</p>
<p>and colonizing other planets,</p>
<p>and perhaps one day expanding outside the solar system</p>
<p>and expanding, colonizing our galaxy and beyond?</p>
<p>Honestly, I know very little about space exploration.</p>
<p>I think it makes complete sense to me</p>
<p>why we are starting to think very seriously about it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an amazing and baffling and innovative solution</p>
<p>to a lot of problems we see as a world population.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t really offer very much of interest on the topic.</p>
<p>I think when I&rsquo;m talking about transcending humanity</p>
<p>and transcending Earth, I&rsquo;m talking usually</p>
<p>about deriving truth, and that&rsquo;s one of the things</p>
<p>that makes theoretical math and physics so interesting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, I really, really love biology, for example,</p>
<p>but biology is a combination of whatever principles</p>
<p>ensure evolution and whatever weird coincidences</p>
<p>happened billions of years ago.</p>
<p>So do you think it&rsquo;s more interesting to understand</p>
<p>the fundamental mechanisms of evolution, for example,</p>
<p>than it is the results, the messy results of its processes?</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t say which is more interesting.</p>
<p>I can say which I think is more deep.</p>
<p>I think theory and abstraction, which can be achieved</p>
<p>completely deductively, is deeper because it has nothing</p>
<p>to do with circumstance and everything to do</p>
<p>with logic and thought.</p>
<p>So, like, if we were ever to interact with aliens,</p>
<p>for example, we would not have our biology in common</p>
<p>if these were some sort of really intelligent life form.</p>
<p>We would have math and physics in common because the laws</p>
<p>of physics will be the same everywhere in the universe.</p>
<p>Our particular anatomy and biology pertains only to life</p>
<p>on this planet, and the principles may apply</p>
<p>more ubiquitously.</p>
<p>Do you ever think about aliens, like, what they might look like?</p>
<p>I try to, when I deal with thought experiments like these,</p>
<p>I try to keep a very abstract mindset,</p>
<p>and I notice that whenever I try to instantiate</p>
<p>these abstractions, I corrupt whatever thoughts there are</p>
<p>for which they&rsquo;re useful.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s kind of like the labels discussion.</p>
<p>So, like, the moment you try to make it concrete,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s probably going to look like some cute version</p>
<p>of a human, like, it&rsquo;s the little green fellas</p>
<p>with the eyes and so on, or whatever.</p>
<p>Whatever the movies have instilled,</p>
<p>like, your cultural upbringing, you&rsquo;re going to project</p>
<p>onto that and the assumptions you have.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>So you prefer to sort of step away and think</p>
<p>and abstract notions of what it means to be intelligent,</p>
<p>what it means to be a living life form</p>
<p>and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Mm hmm. I try to, I almost try to pretend I&rsquo;m blind</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m deaf and I&rsquo;m only a mind</p>
<p>with no inductive reasoning capacity</p>
<p>when I&rsquo;m trying to think about thought experiments like these,</p>
<p>because I know that if I incorporate</p>
<p>whatever my eyes instruct my brain,</p>
<p>I will impede my ability to think as deeply as possible.</p>
<p>Because once again, it&rsquo;s the thing which shallows our thought</p>
<p>can be the incorporation of circumstance and coincidence.</p>
<p>And for particular kinds of thought, that&rsquo;s very important.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not discounting the use of inductive reasoning</p>
<p>in many humanities and in many sciences,</p>
<p>but for the deepest of thoughts,</p>
<p>once again, I feel it&rsquo;s important to try to transcend</p>
<p>whatever methods of observation characterize human experience.</p>
<p>See, but within that, that&rsquo;s all really beautifully put.</p>
<p>I wonder if there is a common mathematics</p>
<p>and a common physics between us and alien beings,</p>
<p>we still have to make concrete the methods of communication.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a fascinating question of like,</p>
<p>while remaining in these abstract fundamental ideas,</p>
<p>how do we communicate with them?</p>
<p>I mean, I suppose that that question could be applied</p>
<p>to different cultures on earth,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s finding a common language.</p>
<p>Do you think about that kind of problem</p>
<p>of basically communicating abstract fundamental ideas?</p>
<p>My least favorite aspect of math or physics</p>
<p>or any of these really deep sciences</p>
<p>is the symbolic component. You know, I&rsquo;m dyslexic.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like looking at symbols.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re too often a source of ambiguity.</p>
<p>And I think you&rsquo;re entirely right that if one thing</p>
<p>holds us back with communication</p>
<p>with something that behaves or looks nothing like us,</p>
<p>I think if one thing holds us back</p>
<p>it will be symbols and the communication of deep thought.</p>
<p>Because as I said, I think communication</p>
<p>frequently compromises thought by intention</p>
<p>or by just theoretical inadequacy.</p>
<p>So on this topic, actually,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;d be fun to see what your thoughts are.</p>
<p>Do you think math is invented or discovered?</p>
<p>So you said that math, we might share many different things.</p>
<p>Some ideas of mathematics and physics with alien life forms.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s uniform in some sense of uniform throughout the universe.</p>
<p>Do you think this thing that we call mathematics</p>
<p>is something that&rsquo;s kind of fundamental to the world we live in</p>
<p>or is it just some kind of pretty axioms and theorems</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve come up with to try to describe</p>
<p>the patterns we see in the world?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s completely discovered</p>
<p>and completely fundamental to all experience.</p>
<p>I think the only component of mathematics</p>
<p>that has been invented is the expression of it.</p>
<p>And I think in some sense, there&rsquo;s almost an arrogance</p>
<p>required to believe that whatever aspect we invent</p>
<p>having to do with math and physics and theory,</p>
<p>there is an arrogance required to truly believe</p>
<p>that that belongs on any sort of stage</p>
<p>with the actual beauty of the matters being discovered.</p>
<p>So we need our minds and in some sense our pens</p>
<p>to be able to play with these things</p>
<p>and communicate about them.</p>
<p>And those hands and those pens are the things</p>
<p>which smudge the most beautiful thing</p>
<p>that humanity can ever experience.</p>
<p>And maybe if we interact with some intelligent life form,</p>
<p>they will have their own unique smudges.</p>
<p>But the canvas, which is beautiful,</p>
<p>must be identical because that is</p>
<p>universal and ubiquitous truth.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what makes it deep and meaningful</p>
<p>is that it&rsquo;s so much more important than whatever</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re programmed to enjoy as an aspect of human experience.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s really beautifully put.</p>
<p>The human language is these messy smudges</p>
<p>of trying to express something underlying that</p>
<p>is beautiful.</p>
<p>Speaking of that, on the physics side,</p>
<p>do you think the pursuit of a theory of everything</p>
<p>in physics, as we may call it in our current times,</p>
<p>of understanding the basic fabric of reality</p>
<p>from a physics perspective is an important pursuit?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s essential.</p>
<p>As I&rsquo;ve said, I think ideation is our only escape</p>
<p>from the constraints of human condition.</p>
<p>And I think that it&rsquo;s important that all great thoughts</p>
<p>and ideas are bound together.</p>
<p>And I think the math is beautiful.</p>
<p>And it ensures that the things which</p>
<p>bind great ideas which have already been had</p>
<p>and great discoveries together, it</p>
<p>ensures that those strings will be beautiful.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s very important to unify</p>
<p>all theories that have brought us to where we are.</p>
<p>Do you think humans can do it?</p>
<p>Do you think humans can solve this puzzle?</p>
<p>Is it possible that we, with our limited cognitive capacity,</p>
<p>will never be able to truly understand this deep,</p>
<p>like deeply understand this underlying canvas?</p>
<p>I think if not, it will be people like you</p>
<p>who invent some sort of, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll call it computation for now,</p>
<p>that will be able to not only discover</p>
<p>that which transcends humanity, but to transcend</p>
<p>human methods of discovering that which is above it.</p>
<p>So superintelligence systems, AGI, and so on,</p>
<p>that are better physicists than us.</p>
<p>I wonder if you might be able to comment.</p>
<p>So your dad does happen to be somebody</p>
<p>who boldly seeks this kind of deep understanding of physics,</p>
<p>the underlying nature of reality from a physics perspective,</p>
<p>from a mathematical physics perspective.</p>
<p>Do you have hope your dad figures it out?</p>
<p>I have great hope.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not supposed to be my journey.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s supposed to be his journey.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s supposed to be his to express to the world.</p>
<p>Obviously, I&rsquo;m so proud that I&rsquo;m connected</p>
<p>to someone who is determined to do such a thing.</p>
<p>And on the other hand, maybe in some sense,</p>
<p>I feel bad for him for having to,</p>
<p>if he&rsquo;s going to be the thing which discovers</p>
<p>some sort of grand unified theory and expresses it,</p>
<p>I feel sorry that he will have to smudge whatever</p>
<p>canvas this thing is.</p>
<p>Because he&rsquo;s human.</p>
<p>Really, I think I know I&rsquo;ve seen a little bit of what</p>
<p>I think great math and great physics looks like.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s unbelievably beautiful.</p>
<p>And then you have to present it to a world</p>
<p>with market constraints and all of this messy sloppiness.</p>
<p>I feel bad in some sense for my dad</p>
<p>because he has to go back and forth</p>
<p>between this beautiful world of math</p>
<p>and whatever the messiness is of his human life.</p>
<p>And then the scientific community</p>
<p>broadly with egos and tensions and just</p>
<p>the dynamics of what makes us human.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s also very lucky that he gets to play</p>
<p>with these sorts of things.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a mixed bag.</p>
<p>I both feel a little sorry for him</p>
<p>for having to deal with the beauty as well as</p>
<p>the smudging and the sloppiness of human expression.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s difficult not to envy such a beautiful insight</p>
<p>or life or vision.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s your own path as well</p>
<p>is this kind of struggle of, as you mentioned,</p>
<p>exploring the beauty of different ideas</p>
<p>while having to communicate those ideas with the best smudges</p>
<p>you can in a world that wants to put labels,</p>
<p>that wants to misinterpret, that wants to destroy</p>
<p>the beauty of those ideas.</p>
<p>And you seem to, at this time, with your youthful enthusiasm,</p>
<p>embracing that struggle despite the fear in the face of fear.</p>
<p>And your dad also carries that same youthful enthusiasm</p>
<p>as well.</p>
<p>But that said, your dad, Eric Weinstein,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a powerful voice, I would say,</p>
<p>a powerful intellect in public discourse.</p>
<p>Is this a burden for you or an inspiration or both</p>
<p>as a young mind yourself?</p>
<p>I think, as I said, there&rsquo;s this weird contrast of I</p>
<p>know that he has ideas, which I think are very beautiful,</p>
<p>and I know he has to deal with the sort of there&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>you have to sacrifice in beauty when you bring it</p>
<p>to a world which is not always beautiful.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s an aspect of that which sort of scares me</p>
<p>about this kind of thing.</p>
<p>I also think that, especially since I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>trying to think about how I should appear publicly,</p>
<p>my dad has been very inspirational</p>
<p>in that I think he brings a sort of fastidious care</p>
<p>to very difficult conversations that.</p>
<p>What does fastidious mean?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just very careful and thoughtful.</p>
<p>He brings that sort of attitude to, I think,</p>
<p>really difficult conversations.</p>
<p>And I know that I don&rsquo;t have that skill yet.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m terrible, but.</p>
<p>The care, the nuance, and yet not</p>
<p>being afraid to push forward.</p>
<p>Yeah, I would really like to learn from my dad there.</p>
<p>I think also my dad has been very important to my life</p>
<p>just because I&rsquo;ve always been a sort of very idiosyncratic</p>
<p>thinker.</p>
<p>And I think I don&rsquo;t always know how</p>
<p>to interact with the world for those sorts of reasons.</p>
<p>And I think my dad has always been similar.</p>
<p>And if not for my dad, I don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>if I would just believe that I was stupid or something.</p>
<p>Because I don&rsquo;t know if I would know</p>
<p>how to interpret my differences from convention.</p>
<p>So he gave you the power to be different</p>
<p>and use that as a superpower.</p>
<p>Yeah, I guess you could put it that way.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know who I would believe I</p>
<p>am if I didn&rsquo;t have my dad telling me</p>
<p>that it wasn&rsquo;t my own stupidity which</p>
<p>alienated me from certain aspects of standard life.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m very, very thankful for that.</p>
<p>Is there a fond memory you have about an interaction</p>
<p>with your dad, either funny, profound, that kind of sticks</p>
<p>with you now?</p>
<p>A lot.</p>
<p>Part of the reason I ask that, of course,</p>
<p>is just fascinating to see somebody as brilliant as you,</p>
<p>see how the people that you interact with,</p>
<p>how they form the mind that you have,</p>
<p>but also to give an insight of another public figure</p>
<p>like your dad to see from your perspective of what</p>
<p>kind of little magical moments happen in private life.</p>
<p>I would say I remember I think I just posted about this</p>
<p>on Instagram or something.</p>
<p>Otherwise, it didn&rsquo;t happen.</p>
<p>If you didn&rsquo;t post that, yeah.</p>
<p>One person who&rsquo;s always sort of mattered</p>
<p>to whatever weird life and experience I&rsquo;ve had</p>
<p>has been this comedian, Tom Lehrer.</p>
<p>Do you know him?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I love him very much.</p>
<p>Likewise.</p>
<p>Anyway, I remember I think I was five or something.</p>
<p>My dad came home with the CD, this Tom Lehrer CD,</p>
<p>and he told me to listen to it.</p>
<p>And it was all of this bizarre satirical writing</p>
<p>about prostitution and cutting up babies</p>
<p>and all kinds of ridiculously vile content</p>
<p>for a five year old.</p>
<p>I think beyond just my love of Tom Lehrer,</p>
<p>I think it was a way for my dad to express</p>
<p>that from a very young age, he was really</p>
<p>ready to treat me like an adult, and he</p>
<p>was ready to trust me and share his life and his enjoyments</p>
<p>with me in a way that was unconventional</p>
<p>because he was willing to discard tradition</p>
<p>for the chance at a really unique and meaningful</p>
<p>parental relationship.</p>
<p>So trusting that his particular brand of weirdness</p>
<p>is something you can understand at a young age</p>
<p>and embrace and learn from it.</p>
<p>Tom Lehrer, we should clarify, is not all about,</p>
<p>what is it, murder and prostitution.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s one of the wittiest, most brilliant musical artists.</p>
<p>If you haven&rsquo;t listened to his work, you should.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s just a rare intellect who&rsquo;s able to sort of,</p>
<p>in catchy rhyme, express some really difficult ideas</p>
<p>through satire, I suppose.</p>
<p>That still, even though it&rsquo;s decades ago,</p>
<p>still resonates today, some of the ideas that he expressed.</p>
<p>I will say also that I think I am probably</p>
<p>a more cultured person having listened to Tom Lehrer</p>
<p>than I would have been without, I think,</p>
<p>a lot of his comedy draws upon a canon</p>
<p>that I was really driven to research by saying,</p>
<p>oh, what does this mean?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t understand that reference.</p>
<p>There are a lot of references there</p>
<p>to really inspirational things, which he sort of assumes</p>
<p>going into a lot of his songs.</p>
<p>And for many of us, like me, you have</p>
<p>to piece those things together, looking at Wikipedia pages</p>
<p>and whatnot.</p>
<p>But to tie this back to the original question,</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s sort of a break it,</p>
<p>you bought it notion of parenting.</p>
<p>I think, really, if you&rsquo;re not going to accept a standard,</p>
<p>you have to invent your own.</p>
<p>And I think, in some ways, that was my dad&rsquo;s way of telling me</p>
<p>that if I was too unstandard as a child,</p>
<p>he would invent his own way of parenting me</p>
<p>because that was worth it to him.</p>
<p>And I think that was very meaningful to me.</p>
<p>I know you&rsquo;re young.</p>
<p>This is a weird time to ask this question.</p>
<p>Are you cognizant on the role of love</p>
<p>in your relationship with your dad?</p>
<p>Are you at a place mentally, as a man yourself,</p>
<p>to admit that you love the guy?</p>
<p>I love my dad with the connection</p>
<p>that I think I&rsquo;ve had to very few things in the world.</p>
<p>I think my dad is one of the people that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>allowed me to see myself.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t know who I would imagine myself to be</p>
<p>if not for my dad.</p>
<p>That isn&rsquo;t to say that I agree with him on everything.</p>
<p>But I think he&rsquo;s given me courage to accept myself</p>
<p>and to believe that I can teach myself where I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>unable to learn from convention.</p>
<p>So I love my dad very dearly, yes.</p>
<p>Is there ways in which you wish you could be a better son?</p>
<p>Firstly, I&rsquo;d like to say I&rsquo;m sure before I figure out</p>
<p>exactly what those are.</p>
<p>I think whenever I come to conclusions</p>
<p>on what that means, I&rsquo;m eager to take them.</p>
<p>What do you mean by that?</p>
<p>What do you mean by a conclusion?</p>
<p>If I have an idea for how to be a better son,</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;m inclined to try to be that person.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s true of almost anything.</p>
<p>I think if I have ideas for improvement,</p>
<p>it would be wasteful not to act on them.</p>
<p>So I suppose one thing I could say</p>
<p>is that I think idealism and what could almost</p>
<p>be considered naivete is not necessarily</p>
<p>a lacking of maturity, but instead an obligation</p>
<p>to those older than us who have lived and seen too much</p>
<p>to fully believe in what is naive and right</p>
<p>without the assistance of the young</p>
<p>to reinspire traditional idealism.</p>
<p>And so perhaps instead of trying to be more mature all the time,</p>
<p>I should spend some time trying to be an idealistic form of hope</p>
<p>in the lives of people who maybe have seen too much</p>
<p>to retain all of that original hope.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s difficult,</p>
<p>but especially appearing in public</p>
<p>as someone as young as I am, I think</p>
<p>anything I do, which is juvenile by choice,</p>
<p>will be held against me.</p>
<p>But maybe that&rsquo;s a sacrifice that I have to make.</p>
<p>I have to retain some sort of youthful hope and optimism.</p>
<p>Yeah, I can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m going to get teary eyed now, but I have allergies.</p>
<p>But also, this is pretty powerful what you&rsquo;re saying.</p>
<p>I certainly share your ideas.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s something I struggle with just by instinct.</p>
<p>You should read The Idiot by Dostoevsky.</p>
<p>By instinct, I love being naive and seeing</p>
<p>the world from a hopeful perspective,</p>
<p>from an optimistic perspective.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s sad that that is something</p>
<p>you pay a price for in this world,</p>
<p>like in the academic world, especially as you&rsquo;re coming up</p>
<p>through schooling.</p>
<p>But just actually, it&rsquo;s a hit on your reputation</p>
<p>throughout your life.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a sad truth, but you have to, for many things,</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s a principle you hold, you</p>
<p>have to be willing to pay the costs.</p>
<p>And ultimately, I believe that in part,</p>
<p>a hopeful view will help you realize</p>
<p>the best version of yourself.</p>
<p>Because optimism is a kind of, optimism is productive.</p>
<p>Like believing that the world is and can be amazing</p>
<p>allows you to create a more amazing world somehow.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m not sure if it&rsquo;s the human nature</p>
<p>of a fundamental law of physics.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>But believe in the impossible in the sense</p>
<p>being optimistic about the thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s similar, going back to what you&rsquo;ve said,</p>
<p>is believing that a radical, that a powerful single idea,</p>
<p>that a single individual can revolutionize some framework</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re operating in that will change</p>
<p>the world for the better.</p>
<p>Believing that allows you to have the chance</p>
<p>to create that.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m with you on the optimism.</p>
<p>But you may have to pay a cost of optimism</p>
<p>and naive hopefulness.</p>
<p>I mean, in some sense, optimism limits freedom.</p>
<p>I think if we don&rsquo;t really have much choice in choosing</p>
<p>what is perfect, if it exists as an ideal,</p>
<p>then there isn&rsquo;t much room for creativity.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a danger of optimism, is someone</p>
<p>who would like to be creative.</p>
<p>I think it was Warren Zeevon said,</p>
<p>accepting dreams, you&rsquo;re never really free.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s something I think about a lot.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s an interesting guy, also.</p>
<p>I really like him.</p>
<p>On that topic, you do have a bit of an appreciation</p>
<p>and connection with music.</p>
<p>I saw you play some guitar a few months ago.</p>
<p>Can you put, in a philosophical sense,</p>
<p>your connection to music?</p>
<p>What insights about life, about just the way</p>
<p>you see the world, do you get from music?</p>
<p>I think the role music has played in my life</p>
<p>was originally motivated by wanting</p>
<p>to prove things to myself.</p>
<p>I really have no ear for music.</p>
<p>I have a terrible sense of pitch.</p>
<p>And I think a lot of music relies</p>
<p>on very standard teaching.</p>
<p>If you think about lessons, for example, music lessons,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a routine to them, which is so archaic and traditional</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s no room for deviation.</p>
<p>I think all of that suggested to me</p>
<p>that I would never have a relationship with music.</p>
<p>I loved listening to music.</p>
<p>It was just difficult to me.</p>
<p>It saddened me.</p>
<p>I wanted to know if there was any way I could build</p>
<p>a connection to music, given who I am, my own idiosyncrasies,</p>
<p>what challenges I have.</p>
<p>I decided to try to learn music theory</p>
<p>before I touched an instrument.</p>
<p>I think that gave me a very unique opportunity instead</p>
<p>of spending my time fruitlessly at the beginning</p>
<p>on the syntax of a particular instrument.</p>
<p>This is how you, this is your posture on the piano.</p>
<p>This is how you hold your fingers.</p>
<p>I tried instead to learn what made music work.</p>
<p>And the wonderful thing about that</p>
<p>was I&rsquo;m pretty sure that any instrument with discrete notes</p>
<p>is mine for the taking within a day or so of having</p>
<p>the ability to play with it.</p>
<p>So I think approaching music abstractly</p>
<p>gave me the ability to instantiate it everywhere.</p>
<p>And I think it also taught me something about self teaching.</p>
<p>Recently, I&rsquo;ve tried getting into classical music</p>
<p>because, at least traditionally, this</p>
<p>is the thing which is thought to require the most</p>
<p>rigor and traditional teaching.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s essentially taught me,</p>
<p>even if I&rsquo;ll never be a great classical performer,</p>
<p>that there is nothing one can&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>teach themself in this era.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve been enjoying whatever connection I have with music.</p>
<p>The other thing I&rsquo;ll say about it</p>
<p>is that it&rsquo;s a very rewarding learning process.</p>
<p>We know, for example, that music accesses our neurochemicals</p>
<p>very directly.</p>
<p>And if you teach yourself a little bit of theory</p>
<p>and are able to instantiate it on an instrument</p>
<p>without wasting your time or spending your time tediously</p>
<p>on learning the particulars of that instrument,</p>
<p>you can instantly sit down and access your own dopamine loops.</p>
<p>And so you don&rsquo;t really need to motivate yourself with music</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re giving your brain drugs.</p>
<p>Who needs motivation to give themselves drugs?</p>
<p>And learn something.</p>
<p>So I think more people should be playing music.</p>
<p>I think a lot of people don&rsquo;t realize how easy it</p>
<p>can be to approach if you take a sort of unstandard approach.</p>
<p>And the unstandard approach in your sense</p>
<p>was understanding the theory first,</p>
<p>and then just from the foundation of the theory,</p>
<p>be able to then just take on any instrument</p>
<p>and start creating something that sounds reasonably good</p>
<p>or learning something that sounds reasonably good.</p>
<p>And then plugging into the, as you call them,</p>
<p>the dopamine loops of your brain,</p>
<p>allowing yourself to enjoy the process.</p>
<p>What about the pain in the ass rigorous process of practice?</p>
<p>So is there something about my dopamine loops, for example,</p>
<p>that enjoys doing the same thing over and over and over again</p>
<p>and watching myself improve?</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s because music is more effective at accessing us</p>
<p>when it&rsquo;s played correctly.</p>
<p>And I think you play, I&rsquo;m positive that you play music</p>
<p>much more correctly than I do.</p>
<p>So if you are going to sit down and play something</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ve learned, that piece will be much more satisfying</p>
<p>to your ears and to your brain than if I</p>
<p>were to play that piece just sitting down</p>
<p>with an instrument.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s sort of a trade off with freedom and rigor</p>
<p>because even if I should be spending more of my time</p>
<p>practicing rigorously, I know I don&rsquo;t have to to make me happy.</p>
<p>Well, Jocko Willink, I think, has this saying</p>
<p>that discipline is freedom.</p>
<p>So maybe the repetition of the disciplined repetition</p>
<p>is actually one of the mechanisms of achieving freedom.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s another way to get to freedom,</p>
<p>that it doesn&rsquo;t have to be a constraint,</p>
<p>but in a sense, unlocks greater sets of opportunity</p>
<p>than results in a deeper experience of freedom.</p>
<p>Maybe.</p>
<p>Particularly if you&rsquo;re thinking about discipline</p>
<p>and method for improvisation, there</p>
<p>are a million pieces that you could improvise</p>
<p>with the same discipline in how to approach</p>
<p>that improvisation.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s true that discipline promotes freedom</p>
<p>if you insert a layer of indirection.</p>
<p>Because I think if you&rsquo;re trying to learn</p>
<p>one piece that was written 400 years ago</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re playing it over and over again,</p>
<p>there is nothing personal or creative about that process,</p>
<p>even if it&rsquo;s beautiful and satisfying.</p>
<p>There has to be some sort of discipline applied</p>
<p>to the creativity of self.</p>
<p>So I think that is the layer of indirection</p>
<p>which reconciles both approaches to freedom and discipline</p>
<p>and enjoyment of music.</p>
<p>Discipline applied to the creativity of self.</p>
<p>Damn, Zev.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Now, as an aging man yourself, if you</p>
<p>were to give advice to young folks today</p>
<p>of how to approach life and maybe advice to yourself,</p>
<p>is there some way you could condense a set of principles,</p>
<p>a set of advices you would give to yourself</p>
<p>and to other young folks of how to live life?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>I would say that with the collapse of systems</p>
<p>that have existed for thousands of years,</p>
<p>whatever is happening with universities</p>
<p>might be an example of some system that may or may not</p>
<p>be decaying.</p>
<p>I think with the destruction of important systems,</p>
<p>there is a unique opportunity to invest in oneself.</p>
<p>And I think that is always the right approach,</p>
<p>provided that the investment one makes in his self</p>
<p>is obligated towards humanity as a whole.</p>
<p>And I think that is the great struggle of my generation.</p>
<p>Will we create our own paths that</p>
<p>are capable of saving whatever is collapsing?</p>
<p>Or will we be squashed by the debris?</p>
<p>And I hope to articulate what patterns</p>
<p>I see this struggle taking over the years</p>
<p>that my generation becomes particularly</p>
<p>active in the world as an important force.</p>
<p>I think already we&rsquo;re important as a demographic</p>
<p>to particular markets.</p>
<p>But I should hope that our voices will matter as well,</p>
<p>starting very soon.</p>
<p>So I would try to think about that.</p>
<p>That would be my advice.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a silly question to ask, perhaps.</p>
<p>But a bit of a Russian one.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s silly because you&rsquo;re young, but I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s actually silly because you&rsquo;re young.</p>
<p>Do you ponder your mortality?</p>
<p>And are you just afraid of death in general?</p>
<p>So tying us back to our previous conversations</p>
<p>about abstraction versus experience,</p>
<p>which is determining our notions of our life and our world,</p>
<p>death is interesting in that it is obviously hyper</p>
<p>important to a person&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>And it is something that, for the most part,</p>
<p>no human will really experience and be able to reflect upon.</p>
<p>So our notions of death are sort of proof</p>
<p>that if we want to make the most of our lives,</p>
<p>we have to think abstractly and relying not at all at times</p>
<p>on experiential thought and understandings</p>
<p>because we can&rsquo;t really experience death and reflect</p>
<p>upon it hence and use it to motivate us.</p>
<p>It has to remain some sort of abstraction.</p>
<p>And I think if we have trouble comprehending true abstraction,</p>
<p>we tend to view ourselves as nearly immortal.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s very dangerous.</p>
<p>So one concrete implication for my belief in abstraction</p>
<p>would be that we all need to be aware of our own deaths.</p>
<p>And we need to understand concretely</p>
<p>the boundaries of our lifetimes.</p>
<p>And no amount of experience can really motivate that.</p>
<p>It has to be driven by thought and abstraction in theory.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one of the deepest elements</p>
<p>of what it means to be human is our ability</p>
<p>to form abstractions about our mortality versus animals.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s just something really fundamental</p>
<p>about our interaction with the abstractions of death.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a lot of philosophers</p>
<p>that say that that&rsquo;s actually core to everything</p>
<p>we create in this world, which is us struggling</p>
<p>with this impossible to understand idea of mortality.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m drawn to this idea because both the mystery of it</p>
<p>but also just from the human experience perspective,</p>
<p>it seems that you get a lot of meaning from stuff ending.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of sad the flip side of that</p>
<p>to think that stuff won&rsquo;t be as meaningful if it doesn&rsquo;t end,</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s not finite.</p>
<p>But it seems like resources gain value from being finite.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s true for time.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true for the deliciousness of ice cream.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true for love, for everything, for music,</p>
<p>and so on.</p>
<p>And yeah, it seems deeply human to try to, as you said,</p>
<p>concretize the abstractions of mortality</p>
<p>even though we can never truly experience it</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s the whole point of it.</p>
<p>Once it ends, you can&rsquo;t experience it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Again, another ridiculous question.</p>
<p>OK.</p>
<p>What do you think is the meaning of it all?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the meaning of life?</p>
<p>From your deep thinking about this world,</p>
<p>is there a good way to answer any</p>
<p>of the why questions about this existence here on Earth?</p>
<p>And as I said, we&rsquo;re here in part by principle</p>
<p>and in part by accident.</p>
<p>And a lot of the things which bring us joy</p>
<p>are programmed to bring us joy to ensure</p>
<p>our evolutionary success.</p>
<p>And so I would not necessarily consider</p>
<p>all of the things which bring us joy to be meaningful.</p>
<p>I think they play a very obvious role and a clear pattern,</p>
<p>and we don&rsquo;t have much choice in that.</p>
<p>I think that outrules the idea of joy</p>
<p>being the meaning of life.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a nice thing we get to have,</p>
<p>even if it&rsquo;s not inherently meaningful.</p>
<p>I think the most wonderful thing that we have ever been given</p>
<p>has been our ability to, as I said,</p>
<p>observe what transcends us as humans.</p>
<p>And I think to live a meaningful life is to see that</p>
<p>and hopefully contribute to that.</p>
<p>So to try to understand what makes us human</p>
<p>and to transcend that and in some small way contribute to it</p>
<p>in the finite time we have here.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Those are some powerful words.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a truly special human being.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really an honor to talk to you.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;m just, I&rsquo;m a newborn fan of yours</p>
<p>and I can&rsquo;t wait to see how you push the world.</p>
<p>Please embrace the fear you feel and be bold.</p>
<p>And I think you will do some special things in this world.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m confident if the world doesn&rsquo;t destroy you</p>
<p>and I hope it doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Be strong, be brave.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re an inspiration.</p>
<p>Keep doing your thing.</p>
