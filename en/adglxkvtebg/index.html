<p>welcome back everyone</p>
<p>we here we&rsquo;re here for another q a and</p>
<p>if you have questions just jump on</p>
<p>social media we have people in the green</p>
<p>one room that are ready to ask questions</p>
<p>as well i just i tell you there&rsquo;s one</p>
<p>thing steve that i</p>
<p>just don&rsquo;t like when you watch videos</p>
<p>and of course i&rsquo;m doing it now is this</p>
<p>long introduction where you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t forget to subscribe and smash that</p>
<p>like button in fact uh if someone&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna subscribe they&rsquo;re just gonna do it</p>
<p>in fact i think every time you remind</p>
<p>them they probably won&rsquo;t do it so i</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t like to say that but i will say um</p>
<p>anything they say is not meant to</p>
<p>diagnose or replace your medical care</p>
<p>check with your doctor before</p>
<p>you know doing anything</p>
<p>anything at all because that&rsquo;s just the</p>
<p>rules so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s we&rsquo;re gonna go by so let&rsquo;s dive</p>
<p>right in steve okay well having said</p>
<p>that dr berg told me that if i didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>subscribe i&rsquo;m fired so i immediately</p>
<p>subscribe but for the rest of you um you</p>
<p>know he&rsquo;s very genteel and knows that</p>
<p>she&rsquo;ll come to build it and they will</p>
<p>come and that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s happened because</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s what half of what five million</p>

<p>call and talk to dr byrd</p>
<p>hi dr berg</p>
<p>how are you today</p>
<p>i see her spinning her uh</p>
<p>her thing is spinning so i don&rsquo;t know if</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>having a</p>
<p>good connection or not so see well let</p>
<p>me tell you well let&rsquo;s uh sort of put</p>
<p>her on hold and let&rsquo;s go right to social</p>
<p>media</p>
<p>and uh terry has been working very hard</p>
<p>to</p>
<p>oh by the way are you unmuted on all</p>
<p>those doc just to make sure you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>have any of those things muted</p>
<p>um i don&rsquo;t have anything muted all i</p>
<p>hear is a little duck in the background</p>
<p>oh interesting okay well let&rsquo;s see let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>go to social media so</p>
<p>nola from youtube could you please</p>
<p>discuss the best makeup for sensitive</p>
<p>skin</p>
<p>well um</p>
<p>of course i&rsquo;m an expert in that right um</p>
<p>now i i i would just honestly um you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna have to just find something that</p>
<p>is</p>
<p>from ingredients that you can pronounce</p>
<p>from food-based ingredients because all</p>
<p>the chemicals i would avoid things that</p>
<p>involve mineral oil</p>
<p>i would involve i would avoid things</p>
<p>that have alcohol</p>
<p>and just try to find something with</p>
<p>essential oils but as far as makeup goes</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a whole different thing i know</p>
<p>they have</p>
<p>various dyes and things you&rsquo;ve got to be</p>
<p>careful about</p>
<p>is something really cool that</p>
<p>um we are going to be releasing not soon</p>
<p>but uh</p>
<p>probably a month or two um with a a</p>
<p>probiotic that you put on your face but</p>
<p>um that&rsquo;s not makeup so um i guess i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>not really qualified to answer the</p>
<p>question because i haven&rsquo;t researched</p>
<p>that so</p>
<p>i know</p>
<p>karen uses these non-toxic</p>
<p>um brands but i don&rsquo;t have them handy</p>
<p>right now</p>
<p>all right well certainly not all right</p>
<p>ladies well we hope you can come to</p>
<p>understanding there let&rsquo;s see uh chrissy</p>
<p>this time from youtube after extended</p>
<p>fast of up to a week what should we eat</p>
<p>first to continue our weight loss</p>
<p>well you got to make sure if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing a prolonged fast you better go</p>
<p>real gradually into eating don&rsquo;t make</p>
<p>the mistake i made and have this big big</p>
<p>dinner</p>
<p>you want to just have maybe</p>
<p>i would say</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>maybe a little vegetable maybe a little</p>
<p>sauerkraut</p>
<p>half an egg</p>
<p>wait</p>
<p>for an hour</p>
<p>have like maybe a little avocado a</p>
<p>little nut</p>
<p>some nuts and just wait for a bit so you</p>
<p>want to gradually kind of go into it and</p>
<p>then probably</p>
<p>the second day have a little bigger meal</p>
<p>and the third day you have a big meal so</p>
<p>you have to gradually go into it because</p>
<p>your system is adapted to not eating and</p>
<p>uh you can overload the system and what</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t want to have is anything sweet</p>
<p>or sugary at all so if you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>intermittent fasting and you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>doing keto</p>
<p>and you do prolong fasting it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>dangerous to have carbs uh because</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna you&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>mess with your potassium and the</p>
<p>potassium is gonna create a huge shift</p>
<p>because</p>
<p>when you eat carbs</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>especially sugar the</p>
<p>potassium</p>
<p>actually</p>
<p>comes out of the cell or actually out of</p>
<p>the blood into the cell so you end up</p>
<p>with a</p>
<p>very low potassium it&rsquo;s called</p>
<p>hypokalemia it could be dangerous so um</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why i don&rsquo;t recommend carbs but</p>
<p>of course if you&rsquo;re watching you&rsquo;re on</p>
<p>keto so you don&rsquo;t have to worry about</p>
<p>them</p>
<p>no absolutely they&rsquo;re safe from that</p>
<p>okay dr berg why don&rsquo;t we kick it off</p>
<p>with one of our first great quiz</p>
<p>questions here&rsquo;s a true falseer</p>
<p>all right let me just pull this up steve</p>
<p>and the answer is true false one kilo</p>
<p>of spirulina</p>
<p>contains the nutritional value of a</p>
<p>thousand kilos</p>
<p>of</p>
<p>assorted vegetables</p>
<p>well that&rsquo;s a value all right audience</p>
<p>get on to that and let me see uh if we</p>
<p>can bring</p>
<p>uh i&rsquo;m gonna try virginia she&rsquo;s a she is</p>
<p>a</p>
<p>continued guest and really familiar with</p>
<p>the routine</p>
<p>virginia you&rsquo;re on with dr berg</p>
<p>oh you&rsquo;re muted uh i think she is she</p>
<p>muted</p>
<p>can you hear us virginia oh there you go</p>
<p>are you are you talking to me yes yes</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re on without sorry i cannot hear</p>
<p>anybody but you</p>
<p>i apologize okay that&rsquo;s all right but</p>
<p>you can hear dr byrd come on right now</p>
<p>yes you are yes can you hear it</p>
<p>yes</p>
<p>i can you doctor but i don&rsquo;t hear</p>
<p>steve or host or anybody else oh okay my</p>
<p>bedtime is good</p>
<p>but in the morning it&rsquo;s in the early</p>
<p>hundreds</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m having serious</p>
<p>ir going on so i&rsquo;m really trying to but</p>
<p>my biggest concern is that 11 months</p>
<p>that i&rsquo;ve been doing your regimen</p>
<p>healthy keto doing great loss over 50</p>
<p>but what i don&rsquo;t understand is that why</p>
<p>is it now that i&rsquo;m having such a hard</p>
<p>time doing the 48 hour 72 hour fast two</p>
<p>weeks ago i was trying to do that you</p>
<p>told me to add some salt and that really</p>
<p>worked great</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m i&rsquo;m having thinking</p>
<p>going on of wanting to have a big lemony</p>
<p>juicy salad</p>
<p>why is it that i&rsquo;m having this</p>
<p>this block i want to be able to do</p>
<p>intermittent fasting a prolonged one but</p>
<p>i can&rsquo;t and the reason why i want to do</p>
<p>that because of the ir because of my</p>
<p>psoriasis</p>
<p>and i just want to be able to have a</p>
<p>better sleep</p>
<p>got it are you craving um lemon did you</p>
<p>say</p>
<p>lemon and salt</p>
<p>okay so so you need choline choline</p>
<p>choline if you crave a lemon that means</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re deficient in choline</p>
<p>where do i get that from you can just</p>
<p>get it at the uh uh</p>
<p>find it online or it&rsquo;s a supplement but</p>
<p>choline is a unique um nutrient that is</p>
<p>actually lemony and you can even suck on</p>
<p>them as a lemon drop</p>
<p>even on the fasting and you&rsquo;ll and</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll be they&rsquo;ll be like probably candy</p>
<p>to you but there&rsquo;s they&rsquo;re not sweet but</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re lemony</p>
<p>and the the um</p>
<p>your body must be wanting something in</p>
<p>that uh</p>
<p>that tart but the lemon um choline</p>
<p>actually can help strip fat off the</p>
<p>liver</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s good for a lot of things</p>
<p>especially your brain</p>
<p>brain function</p>
<p>and then i&rsquo;m thinking that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re taking the salt which is good and</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m guessing you&rsquo;re also doing the</p>
<p>potassium magnesium from the</p>
<p>electrolytes twice a day i do the</p>
<p>electrolytes and as a matter of fact i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>using weeds that have high amount of uh</p>
<p>sourness like purslane grape leaves i</p>
<p>chop those up in my salads</p>
<p>fantastic</p>
<p>um okay so the other other thing that</p>
<p>you could try when you eat</p>
<p>is um shift to more</p>
<p>robotic foods like</p>
<p>the sauerkraut kimchi</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know if you live close to a</p>
<p>farmer&rsquo;s market but</p>
<p>yes usually the farmers market they</p>
<p>usually someone&rsquo;s selling some fresh</p>
<p>homemade kimchi or or sauerkraut that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just</p>
<p>so much different than the stuff you get</p>
<p>at the store and</p>
<p>boy does that</p>
<p>handle a lot of problems</p>
<p>especially when you&rsquo;re doing even</p>
<p>long-term fasting too if you have that</p>
<p>as your you know part of your meal</p>
<p>on a regular basis</p>
<p>that might might solve your problem so</p>
<p>then your microbes are actually making</p>
<p>nutrients too your microbes actually can</p>
<p>even i&rsquo;ve i&rsquo;ve read something they can</p>
<p>even make omega-3 fatty acids they they</p>
<p>definitely make the b vitamins um</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m going to be diving more into that</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s what i would do</p>
<p>my own ferment costco has the greatest</p>
<p>sauerkraut</p>
<p>great yeah so i do that every day and</p>
<p>okay choline choline that&rsquo;s the one you</p>
<p>need</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a supplement and you just it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of a quasi-b vitamin so you</p>
<p>can suck on it um a few several through</p>
<p>the day and and then come back on and</p>
<p>tell me if that didn&rsquo;t solve your</p>
<p>problem okay everything you&rsquo;ve told me</p>
<p>has worked so i will try this one</p>
<p>wonderful</p>
<p>well thank you uh virginia for joining</p>
<p>us again it&rsquo;s always a great pleasure</p>
<p>and virginia you&rsquo;ll now be able to see</p>
<p>what the audience thought of our first</p>
<p>question and this was a true falsehood</p>
<p>and it asked one or it</p>
<p>asking one kilo of spirulina contains</p>
<p>the nutritional value of a thousand</p>
<p>kilos of assorted vegetables boy that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a lot uh 65 of our respondents say it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>true and 35 say it&rsquo;s false winner please</p>
<p>you know apparently nassau did this</p>
<p>study and it&rsquo;s true and that&rsquo;s uh</p>
<p>i mean i just find that hard to believe</p>
<p>myself but um that&rsquo;s what i um found in</p>
<p>one of the studies that i&rsquo;m going to be</p>
<p>putting down below</p>
<p>which is fascinating because</p>
<p>when i read that</p>
<p>of course i changed my formula my veggie</p>
<p>solution because i of course now i have</p>
<p>to have spirulina because that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>best so that&rsquo;s a combination of</p>
<p>spirulina with moringa</p>
<p>uh in that veggie solution especially</p>
<p>for people that for some weird reason</p>
<p>[Music]</p>
<p>you know people don&rsquo;t consume enough</p>
<p>vegetables they don&rsquo;t like them as much</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t consume as much they have a</p>
<p>hard time consuming 10 cups a day i</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know why steve but</p>
<p>i know you and i do this on a regular</p>
<p>basis but we&rsquo;re probably the only ones</p>
<p>well i tell you what i have uh watched</p>
<p>dr berg eat his lunchtime salad and i</p>
<p>mean it&rsquo;s a commitment because there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>lot of green stuff going there and i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>over in the corner with my hot fudge</p>
<p>sundae looking on shamefully but he just</p>
<p>sticks i have no idea i don&rsquo;t know why</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so hard but uh</p>
<p>uh do what you can you know but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>kind of a spirulina is a</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just an interesting it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not a plant-based</p>
<p>compound steve it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>micro</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a bacteria it&rsquo;s a type of bacteria</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s extremely efficient at turning</p>
<p>sunlight energy into chemical energy and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the first</p>
<p>one of the first things on this planet</p>
<p>that produce oxygen so um</p>
<p>[Music]</p>
<p>yes it&rsquo;s pond scum but</p>
<p>if uh</p>
<p>if if grown correctly in a healthy lake</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s actually quite healthy it has um</p>
<p>even all the essential amino acids</p>
<p>b12 it&rsquo;s a pretty interesting</p>
<p>product wonderful all kidding aside i</p>
<p>have followed lots of dr berg&rsquo;s</p>
<p>recommendations and i am all the better</p>
<p>for it why don&rsquo;t we uh talk about who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>listening to the show and we do have one</p>
<p>uh nice person</p>
<p>lebanon we&rsquo;re not going to bring you on</p>

<p>all represented there so thank you</p>
<p>everybody for participating in the show</p>
<p>and doctor why don&rsquo;t we kick off with</p>
<p>the next question so we can get to all</p>
<p>of them there it is</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>all right what is the first symptom</p>
<p>of high iron levels in the body</p>
<p>all right folks dig into that i cannot</p>
<p>believe uh the audience is so fast at</p>
<p>these things i don&rsquo;t know how they do</p>
<p>their research again they must be</p>
<p>watching your videos</p>
<p>i think so listen let&rsquo;s try um if we can</p>
<p>get scott on the air with you scott is</p>
<p>unmuting himself and you sir are on with</p>
<p>dr byrd</p>
<p>thank you for having me on the show dr</p>
<p>berg i</p>
<p>had a question about uh lemons you you</p>
<p>talk about the the value of lemons in a</p>
<p>lot of your videos and living here in</p>
<p>the sonoran desert were able to grow</p>
<p>citrus trees and i happened to have a</p>
<p>lime tree in my backyard and i was just</p>
<p>wondering if limes have the same or</p>
<p>similar benefits that lemons do in the</p>
<p>keto diet</p>
<p>hey that&rsquo;s great i see that you&rsquo;re right</p>
<p>in your backyard i think it&rsquo;s great um</p>
<p>limes are almost like almost identical</p>
<p>to lemons as far as the nutrition and</p>
<p>the compounds uh there&rsquo;s just some</p>
<p>slight different um phytonutrients but</p>
<p>yeah they&rsquo;re they&rsquo;re gonna work the same</p>
<p>i know i don&rsquo;t talk about limes but um</p>
<p>i would i would use the limes just as</p>
<p>much as you use the lemons absolutely um</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re in the desert where the</p>
<p>climate is probably real nice to grow</p>
<p>these things i i wish i could grow some</p>
<p>limes or lemons in my</p>
<p>part of the country but they just won&rsquo;t</p>
<p>grow</p>
<p>wow yeah they&rsquo;re very plentiful and i</p>
<p>almost have them year-round so it&rsquo;s wow</p>
<p>i&rsquo;d like to have a really good use for</p>
<p>them and now i do</p>
<p>hey that&rsquo;s great thanks for</p>
<p>chiming in scott that&rsquo;s great and by the</p>
<p>way i just put a full uh screen of scott</p>
<p>up i want you to see where he is there</p>
<p>you can see that lovely cactus</p>
<p>beautiful background</p>
<p>i know he&rsquo;s living large out there in</p>
<p>arizona so thank you so much scott for</p>
<p>getting together with us and and give us</p>
<p>a shout back and let us know how it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going for you</p>
<p>okay let&rsquo;s see uh where are we let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>make sure that we are taking care of all</p>
<p>of our social media friends and terry&rsquo;s</p>
<p>our producer has been typing furiously</p>
<p>debbie from youtube how do you feel</p>
<p>about a super beat</p>
<p>products i am a diabetic but i am</p>
<p>keeping it under control</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some benefits to the beat</p>
<p>there are some benefits uh</p>
<p>nitric oxide and which is good for your</p>
<p>vascular system</p>
<p>but if you&rsquo;re diabetic and you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>beet</p>
<p>juice you can powder without the fiber</p>
<p>you you may see a blood sugar problem</p>
<p>with that now i&rsquo;m not saying that</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s gonna be a problem with with</p>
<p>creating more</p>
<p>issues it just might raise your blood</p>
<p>sugar but the all the phytonutrients</p>
<p>there</p>
<p>counter some of the the complications</p>
<p>from diabetes</p>
<p>versus some refined sugar but um</p>
<p>you know think about how they make sugar</p>
<p>in the us the majority of the sugar in</p>
<p>the us comes from beets</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>of course it&rsquo;s gmo</p>
<p>but um</p>
<p>because like 95 of all the beets are gmo</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>i if you&rsquo;re a diabetic i probably would</p>
<p>use a different supplement um to solve</p>
<p>your problem with whatever you&rsquo;re trying</p>
<p>to solve because it you know beet juice</p>
<p>powder is just really really sweet the</p>
<p>same thing with carrot juice i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>recommend that</p>
<p>at all in fact i used to do a lot of it</p>
<p>and it definitely can</p>
<p>mess with your blood sugars</p>
<p>all righty let&rsquo;s go over to facebook</p>
<p>anna uh it was mentioned that you</p>
<p>advocate eating cruciferous vegetables</p>
<p>but it doesn&rsquo;t appear good for someone</p>
<p>with sibo if i&rsquo;m saying that right what</p>
<p>do you suggest for someone to get</p>
<p>nutritional benefits of cruciferous</p>
<p>vegetables with that condition</p>
<p>when someone is sibo they have bacteria</p>
<p>in the wrong place it&rsquo;s in the small</p>
<p>intestine it should be in the large</p>
<p>intestine so um</p>
<p>the reason you don&rsquo;t want that is</p>
<p>because the microbes now um compete for</p>
<p>your nutrients and you get a lot of</p>
<p>bloating and so what you don&rsquo;t want to</p>
<p>be taking is another probiotic or take</p>
<p>fiber or eating a lot of vegetables</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>ferment at the wrong place</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re going to feel all gassed out</p>
<p>so what you want to do is take um</p>
<p>uh probably not do a lot of vegetables</p>
<p>for a while you&rsquo;ll be maybe a carnivore</p>
<p>for a month or so and then do betaine</p>
<p>hydrochloride to acidify the stomach</p>
<p>and maybe some natural</p>
<p>antibiotics like garlic and oregano</p>
<p>all right that&rsquo;s terrific thank you doc</p>
<p>for that and let&rsquo;s see oh we&rsquo;ve got the</p>
<p>answers i told you they&rsquo;re very quick</p>
<p>and you asked the audience what is the</p>
<p>first symptom of high iron levels</p>
<p>in the body</p>
<p>and 65 excuse me</p>
<p>35 of respondents say joint pain 30 say</p>
<p>dark or black steels 30 say fatigue or</p>
<p>dizziness and finally 5 say headaches</p>
<p>well um the answer is</p>
<p>arthritis</p>
<p>and especially</p>
<p>in this knuckle right here the first uh</p>
<p>knuckle</p>
<p>uh on your hands and then it&rsquo;s maybe the</p>
<p>second knuckle and your knees</p>
<p>apparently that&rsquo;s kind of one of the</p>
<p>first symptoms to happen when you have</p>
<p>too much iron</p>
<p>and the problem with iron is that we</p>
<p>have a hard time getting rid of iron in</p>
<p>our bodies so</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s easy to accumulate it even when</p>
<p>women go through menopause when they</p>
<p>stop menstruating</p>
<p>they can have this iron problem either</p>
<p>from a genetic problem or just consuming</p>
<p>too much iron this is why i&rsquo;m very much</p>
<p>against the iron supplements</p>
<p>the one a days that are synthetic</p>
<p>not good yes a lot of people have a</p>
<p>deficiency of iron but uh don&rsquo;t start</p>
<p>loading up with iron because there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>couple minerals that your body has no</p>
<p>mechanism to get rid of it if you have</p>
<p>too much and it can be very</p>
<p>toxic it feeds microbes</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>i released a video on that um it might</p>
<p>have been even today steve</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>if you haven&rsquo;t if you want more</p>
<p>information about that just watch the</p>
<p>video that i released today i yeah i did</p>
<p>release the video today</p>
<p>so it just tells it tells me how many</p>
<p>people are really watching my video</p>
<p>steve yeah more is not always better huh</p>
<p>okay so uh amrita from youtube what can</p>
<p>we do to reverse cirrhosis or maybe help</p>
<p>a bum liver</p>
<p>tocotrinols</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a type of vitamin e that helps to</p>
<p>break down</p>
<p>scar tissue and toccotrinos will reduce</p>
<p>fibrosis</p>
<p>and of course eliminating the things</p>
<p>that are creating in the first place</p>
<p>like</p>
<p>getting on a diet that doesn&rsquo;t have a</p>
<p>lot of oxidants like too much sugar and</p>
<p>fructose and</p>
<p>omega 6 fatty acids</p>
<p>and vegetable oils get off that stuff</p>
<p>get on a healthy keto and then and then</p>
<p>prolong fasting here and there we&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>start to um</p>
<p>create a autophagy which is the</p>
<p>recycling of proteins and</p>
<p>damaged proteins in your body</p>
<p>even like the scar tissue so i think</p>
<p>there is a point of</p>
<p>no return but hopefully you&rsquo;re not at</p>
<p>that point where you can do something</p>
<p>about it</p>
<p>wonderful okay let&rsquo;s go back to facebook</p>
<p>what is the cause of pernicious anemia</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s from sarah well b12</p>
<p>but um</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s usually an autoimmune disease</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not usually it&rsquo;s always an</p>
<p>autoimmune disease of the cells</p>
<p>that</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a cells in your stomach that you</p>
<p>could become deficient in it&rsquo;s called</p>
<p>intrinsic factor</p>
<p>that you need to help overcome</p>
<p>overcompensate for that but there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>little autoimmune i&rsquo;m trying to explain</p>
<p>this in a simple way without giving a</p>
<p>lot of big words but there&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>in your stomach that is blocking the</p>
<p>absorption of b12 normally it should</p>
<p>receive it but there&rsquo;s an autoimmune</p>
<p>situation going on that blocks that</p>
<p>absorption so one little</p>
<p>trick you can do</p>
<p>to overcompensate for this</p>
<p>without giving you a lot of details</p>
<p>would be a standard process</p>
<p>product and um</p>
<p>if you take a standard process product i</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s their b12</p>
<p>as the intrinsic factor in there and it</p>
<p>might be</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>that might be a way to overcome</p>
<p>pernicious anemia so just look up search</p>
<p>out</p>
<p>b12 with</p>
<p>standard process products i i do</p>
<p>recommend some of the products over i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>not affiliated with them anymore but</p>
<p>they do have some pretty good products</p>
<p>wonderful well here&rsquo;s someone that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>obviously committed her name is keto</p>
<p>sista as her handle on youtube</p>
<p>and she&rsquo;s been on healthy keto for eight</p>
<p>months now but my scale shows i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>heavier but here we go i can now fit</p>
<p>into a size eight dress so she&rsquo;s getting</p>
<p>tremor yet you know is worried about her</p>
<p>weight</p>
<p>so how can someone</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>shrink</p>
<p>but maybe get heavier how can that be</p>
<p>well</p>
<p>i think what&rsquo;s happening is that she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s losing fat</p>
<p>but she&rsquo;s also gaining more muscle mass</p>
<p>so muscle if you relate muscle to fat in</p>
<p>the same volume there&rsquo;s different</p>
<p>weights on that so um this is why i</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t like going by just losing weight</p>
<p>all the time you got to look at your</p>
<p>size are your clothes looser</p>
<p>are you shrinking</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the best indicator but even a</p>
<p>better indicator than that it&rsquo;s working</p>
<p>is that your appetite is gone</p>
<p>that means that you&rsquo;re converting to fat</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re in ketosis</p>
<p>okay very good let&rsquo;s see if we can get</p>
<p>ella&rsquo;s voice back on ella if you can</p>
<p>hear me uh you&rsquo;re on with dr byrd</p>
<p>hi dr burger can you hear me</p>
<p>i guess you can&rsquo;t ella uh</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just spinning unfortunately okay</p>
<p>yeah ask me yes ella ask me your</p>
<p>question and i&rsquo;ll i&rsquo;ll let dr berg know</p>
<p>what it is</p>
<p>okay so my question is um</p>
<p>i recently had a baby and um</p>
<p>i tried the healthy keto diet with my</p>
<p>husband</p>
<p>and while my husband lost some weight he</p>
<p>lost about 25 pounds in two months i was</p>
<p>unable to lose not a single pound okay</p>
<p>stand by so ella just had a baby</p>
<p>congratulations and she and her husband</p>
<p>were on the keto diet and he lost a</p>
<p>bunch of weight but she hasn&rsquo;t seemed to</p>
<p>see the scale come down what can we do</p>
<p>for ella</p>
<p>yes</p>
<p>unfortunately women have a harder time</p>
<p>losing weight than men just because of</p>
<p>the hormone estrogen and you just had a</p>
<p>baby so your estrogen levels are</p>
<p>probably a little higher than they would</p>
<p>be so you&rsquo;re just going to have to work</p>
<p>harder at it that means you&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>have to go lower with the carbohydrates</p>
<p>that means you have to exercise more</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>you have to do a little bit more</p>
<p>intermittent fasting but again if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>breastfeeding which hopefully you are</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t even want you to do intermittent</p>
<p>fasting i&rsquo;d prefer you just stick with</p>
<p>keto with just three meals and that way</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>your baby will really benefit from that</p>
<p>tremendously</p>
<p>[Music]</p>
<p>then i would just add more exercise and</p>
<p>and then when you stop breastfeeding</p>
<p>start doing more intermittent fasting</p>
<p>but you right now it&rsquo;s all about carbs</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like keep your carbs way down there</p>
<p>to help you lose the weight but again</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>make sure that your clothes if your</p>
<p>clothes are looser that means it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>working if your appetite</p>
<p>is goes down that means it&rsquo;s working</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s wonderful i hope congratulations</p>
<p>to you and your husband and please</p>
<p>report back to us in whatever month or</p>
<p>so and let us know how it&rsquo;s going and</p>
<p>thanks for coming onto the air with dr</p>
<p>berg and why don&rsquo;t we go up with another</p>
<p>quiz question dr berg uh this is another</p>
<p>true false er and here you go</p>
<p>okay true or false 90 of sciatic nerve</p>
<p>pain involves the disc</p>
<p>all right is that true or false audience</p>
<p>i know a lot of you suffer from that uh</p>
<p>so let&rsquo;s see we go let&rsquo;s go back to</p>
<p>facebook</p>
<p>yes spin</p>
<p>i have low levels of folate and b12 what</p>
<p>should i do to address these conditions</p>
<p>well i would</p>
<p>consume foods with b12 that would be</p>
<p>animal products red meat you can do</p>
<p>seafood as well</p>
<p>believe it or not spirulina has b12 if</p>
<p>you</p>
<p>uh if you want another source</p>
<p>but then folate is from the vegetables</p>
<p>you can get that from the dark leafy</p>
<p>greens</p>
<p>so i would start beefing up those no pun</p>
<p>intended</p>
<p>and in addition to that nutritional</p>
<p>yeast</p>
<p>normally does not come with b12 so that</p>
<p>probably wouldn&rsquo;t be your best source</p>
<p>but it would give you some foliate</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s say for example</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing that but you&rsquo;re still</p>
<p>deficient</p>
<p>then what i would do</p>
<p>is i would support</p>
<p>your microbiome because your</p>
<p>microbes can help you make a lot of</p>
<p>these vitamins so it could be</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re just deficient in microbes</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re not getting any help from</p>
<p>those guys</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s uh this is why</p>
<p>even people that they lose their hair</p>
<p>and then all of a sudden they take</p>
<p>biotin and they get the hair back</p>
<p>well</p>
<p>one of the reasons why they lost the</p>
<p>hair in the first place is because their</p>
<p>microbes are off they&rsquo;re not producing</p>
<p>enough biotin and</p>
<p>so i&rsquo;m that microbiome is just a</p>
<p>fascinating um</p>
<p>topic i&rsquo;m i&rsquo;m just so interested in it</p>
<p>for so many different things including</p>
<p>hair loss and including making your b</p>
<p>vitamins and</p>
<p>helping with anxiety and depression so</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a really important thing to</p>
<p>consume microbes from fermented food</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>of course i&rsquo;m doing a deep dive now on</p>
<p>fermenting everything and then testing</p>
<p>it out and then seeing what works best</p>
<p>fantastic okay boy it&rsquo;s so uh gratifying</p>
<p>to see the chat on youtube fly up past</p>
<p>me and i decided to pick one out of the</p>
<p>group bridget reed i am new to keto and</p>
<p>i am experiencing some constipation how</p>
<p>can i consume enough fiber or whatever</p>
<p>without going over the amount of carbs</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m supposed to consume</p>
<p>well you do have this thing called net</p>
<p>carbs so you do subtract the fiber</p>
<p>but what i&rsquo;m going to recommend is you</p>
<p>just beef up your salads</p>
<p>and see if it doesn&rsquo;t handle it</p>
<p>you also there&rsquo;s a couple other things</p>
<p>related to this because um</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say for example you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>all these keto treats</p>
<p>these keto new</p>
<p>functional fibers that are in all these</p>
<p>keto bars and keto products which i am</p>
<p>totally against</p>
<p>some of these fibers</p>
<p>can knock you out of ketosis okay so</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>so you don&rsquo;t necessarily just because</p>
<p>something&rsquo;s a fiber doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>healthy fiber because they&rsquo;re now making</p>
<p>synthetic fibers</p>
<p>and like the soluble corn</p>
<p>fiber and the tapioca fiber</p>
<p>these are all things that</p>
<p>you know people are deducting them from</p>
<p>the total carbs but in reality</p>
<p>this could be reason why you have all</p>
<p>sorts of issues with keto</p>
<p>so when we&rsquo;re talking about fiber i</p>
<p>would probably only deduct that from the</p>
<p>vegetable fibers okay that you have from</p>
<p>a salad something like that leafy greens</p>
<p>but i would add more</p>
<p>greens and i would also for constipation</p>
<p>kill two birds with one stone and have</p>
<p>a probiotic with a prebiotic which would</p>
<p>be like sauerkraut</p>
<p>or kimchi</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>if you actually go to the farmer&rsquo;s</p>
<p>market and get some really good</p>
<p>sauerkraut or make it yourself it is</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so different than the store-bought</p>
<p>which is a lot of times even pasta i</p>
<p>mean pasteurized you kill everything</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not raw there&rsquo;s a big difference</p>
<p>between</p>
<p>making it at home versus</p>
<p>buying it because they have to add</p>
<p>different preservatives and stuff that</p>
<p>kill these microbes but</p>
<p>micro i mean</p>
<p>sauerkraut gives a tremendous amount of</p>
<p>probiotics and it does apparently</p>
<p>survive the stomach acid acid so</p>
<p>i am totally um for that</p>
<p>all right so anyway i really do so</p>
<p>appreciate the role uh that women play</p>
<p>in bringing our beautiful children into</p>
<p>the world i thank my lovely wife lori</p>
<p>for our two kids but they pay it seems</p>
<p>like a lifelong</p>
<p>price where us guys don&rsquo;t and um</p>
<p>as an example gloria from youtube has</p>
<p>been following your advice for a while</p>
<p>but now it&rsquo;s going through menopause</p>
<p>which is making me gain weight uh how</p>
<p>can you help the millions of women that</p>
<p>go through this doc</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a lot to talk about i would say</p>
<p>the main thing that i would do</p>
<p>is do something to support your adrenal</p>
<p>glands</p>
<p>which could be lemon balm tea</p>
<p>ashwagandha b vitamins and then the</p>
<p>other thing is the</p>
<p>take a really good vitamin e uh called</p>
<p>tocotrinos which will support your</p>
<p>your pituitary because now the pituitary</p>
<p>communication to the ovaries is it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s it threw the whole thing off</p>
<p>so now we have to support the pituitary</p>
<p>which is usually like a reservoir for</p>
<p>vitamin e</p>
<p>so if</p>
<p>if one problem you have is related to</p>
<p>hot flashes that vitamin e in the form</p>
<p>of tocatrinos would be good um but i</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t really know of what other problems</p>
<p>you have with menopause is it fatigue</p>
<p>is it um osteopenia i don&rsquo;t know uh one</p>
<p>additional little tip for that would be</p>
<p>to get some dh d e</p>
<p>dhea okay that&rsquo;s a precursor it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>supplement it&rsquo;s a precursor to be</p>
<p>making estrogen and progesterone</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t need much you just need a</p>
<p>little bit because if you have too much</p>
<p>then you can make more testosterone and</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t want to start getting facial</p>
<p>hair</p>
<p>men would want a little bit more but if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going through menopause that dhea</p>
<p>sometimes can really give you the raw</p>
<p>material that you need to build some of</p>
<p>these other hormones that have tanked</p>
<p>wow okay ladies</p>
<p>thanks again for all you do for us</p>
<p>and our kids and let&rsquo;s see the the</p>
<p>audiences answered the next true fault</p>
<p>uh true false which asks uh ninety</p>
<p>percent of sciatic nerve pain involves</p>
<p>the diss</p>
<p>and uh seventy percent of the</p>
<p>respondents said no that&rsquo;s not true</p>
<p>thirty percent say it is true</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s true it is true and</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>um i&rsquo;m not saying a disc protrusion i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>saying it could also be degenerative</p>
<p>disc disease which is just the</p>
<p>flattening of the disc what happens with</p>
<p>sciatica</p>
<p>is that you</p>
<p>lose the curve in your lower back</p>
<p>because the discs</p>
<p>are thinning or</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s usually always when you</p>
<p>see disc problems whether it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>protrusion</p>
<p>a herniation or a</p>
<p>degeneration</p>
<p>you nearly always see this this loss of</p>
<p>the lordosis or the curve in the lower</p>
<p>back</p>
<p>so what does that mean steve with salica</p>
<p>it means that</p>
<p>if you were to put that curve back</p>
<p>you would get relief from sciatica and</p>
<p>that is a video that i just did and i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>going to release which is a simple thing</p>
<p>to do you get a foam roller support a</p>
<p>big one and you start to</p>
<p>lay</p>
<p>on your back with that pushing up into</p>
<p>the back</p>
<p>um it&rsquo;s probably not going to be</p>
<p>comfortable at first but what you do is</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to mold</p>
<p>over time that curve in the back and the</p>
<p>key</p>
<p>the secret is time you want to lay on</p>
<p>that</p>
<p>work up to laying on that for about 20</p>
<p>minutes</p>
<p>every night before you go to sleep</p>
<p>versus just five minutes won&rsquo;t do it so</p>
<p>the longer you do it the more it seems</p>
<p>to mold that curb in there to the point</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;ll have this curve it gives</p>
<p>you more space for these</p>
<p>these nerves that are pinched and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really good for sciatica</p>
<p>wonderful well having just</p>
<p>talked about the lady and the great</p>
<p>sacrifices they made i forgot about one</p>
<p>but rawad from facebook didn&rsquo;t he&rsquo;s 21</p>
<p>and suffering from extreme hair loss for</p>
<p>a year now i&rsquo;m not on keto and have not</p>
<p>taken any supplements during this time</p>
<p>what can we do to help reward well</p>
<p>well you just want to ask yourself with</p>
<p>any of these symptoms when did it</p>
<p>exactly start</p>
<p>and what happened</p>
<p>exactly just before you started losing</p>
<p>hair was it a stress situation if it was</p>
<p>then you addressed adrenals</p>
<p>if it was a change in diet</p>
<p>you</p>
<p>go back to what you did but i&rsquo;m going to</p>
<p>just recommend you do keto because um</p>
<p>and the healthy version of it that way</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll normally get the</p>
<p>the trace minerals that are necessary</p>
<p>for growing hair you&rsquo;ll get enough</p>
<p>quality protein</p>
<p>and b vitamins those are the three</p>
<p>things that will help support hair</p>
<p>terrific nabil from youtube can you</p>
<p>share the best gout friendly keto diet</p>
<p>with the gout</p>
<p>you can do a little trick</p>
<p>sometimes this will help where you do a</p>
<p>combination of</p>
<p>maybe about</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>an eighth of a teaspoon of baking soda</p>
<p>in some water okay on an empty stomach</p>
<p>and then um</p>
<p>wait about an hour</p>
<p>and do about a tablespoon of apple cider</p>
<p>vinegar in some water</p>
<p>and the next hour go back to the baking</p>
<p>soda and go back and forth because</p>
<p>when you alkalize the um</p>
<p>the urine you&rsquo;ll find that your gout</p>
<p>attacks will go away</p>
<p>but the problem is if you keep</p>
<p>alkalizing over a long period of time</p>
<p>without putting back in the acid in your</p>
<p>stomach</p>
<p>you may find that you get more gas</p>
<p>because you altered the microbiome</p>
<p>because</p>
<p>you know you ever heard of lactic acid</p>
<p>from the lactobacillus like you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>want to have an alkaline large bowel so</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a great little trick to go ahead</p>
<p>and try to</p>
<p>overcome this</p>
<p>the other tip i&rsquo;m going to give you with</p>
<p>gout is</p>
<p>i worked with some people with gout and</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re usually not doing</p>
<p>a very strict consistent version of the</p>
<p>keto</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re doing sorta and they kind of</p>
<p>allow certain things in there</p>
<p>too much</p>
<p>fructose</p>
<p>too much</p>
<p>fruit</p>
<p>too much sugar and</p>
<p>sugar is just it just is terrible for</p>
<p>gout um so if you could be really strict</p>
<p>uh you may find that is the answer the</p>
<p>other thing is that you might want to be</p>
<p>careful about even the the um</p>
<p>the sugar alcohols like xylitol</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>and even allulose and other things that</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>these sugars these alternative sugars</p>
<p>that um</p>
<p>can actually aggravate gout and</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>watch my latest videos on that because</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>that can be devastating with your</p>
<p>ability to exercise and walk and</p>
<p>stabilize your whole foot um but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>you know these are just little things</p>
<p>that you can do there&rsquo;s as far as gout</p>
<p>though it&rsquo;s there is not a lot of</p>
<p>information out there with effective</p>
<p>solutions so what i&rsquo;m giving you is</p>
<p>things that i think will</p>
<p>produce a big effect but um</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m always looking for suggestions if</p>
<p>anyone has even better ideas</p>
<p>let me know</p>
<p>wonderful uh not wonderful is mervat</p>
<p>from facebook i was recently diagnosed</p>
<p>with crohn&rsquo;s disease i have no control</p>
<p>over my appetite and suffering from</p>
<p>stomach pain diarrhea nausea no energy</p>
<p>at all please help</p>
<p>yeah you got to go to my healthy version</p>
<p>of the ketogenic diet and</p>
<p>and then if that still doesn&rsquo;t handle it</p>
<p>then you&rsquo;re gonna have to research</p>
<p>carnivore because you you obviously have</p>
<p>inflammation in your gut that&rsquo;s being</p>
<p>aggravated by certain things</p>
<p>anytime you have gut problems i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>care whether it&rsquo;s a gerd acid reflux</p>
<p>irritable bowel bloating</p>
<p>um there&rsquo;s something in your diet that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>disagreeing with your your gut and um</p>
<p>you got to find out what that is and and</p>
<p>i just had a interesting</p>
<p>email from this lady who was very</p>
<p>successful in the ketogenic diet</p>
<p>but she relapsed really bad with her gut</p>
<p>problems and she isolated</p>
<p>being the allulose it&rsquo;s a type of</p>
<p>sweetener that just tore up her</p>
<p>digestive system so</p>
<p>um sometimes it&rsquo;s carrageenan you know</p>
<p>and like a type of seaweed sometimes</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s uh</p>
<p>some other ingredient that you have no</p>
<p>idea that&rsquo;s creating creditiness so uh</p>
<p>this is why you want to</p>
<p>you know do as healthy as possible as</p>
<p>far as the ingredients and then start</p>
<p>eliminating certain things to find out</p>
<p>what the heck is aggravating your</p>
<p>stomach and digestive system</p>
<p>all right very good you know and i would</p>
<p>especially look in the area of these</p>
<p>keto snacks</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re just loaded with these</p>
<p>new synthetic functional fibers which i</p>
<p>do not like</p>
<p>all right be advised folks how about</p>
<p>another true false or doc here it is</p>
<p>stand by</p>
<p>push the button there we go</p>
<p>all right so</p>
<p>true or false wearing shoes increases</p>
<p>the risk for knee pain</p>
<p>jump on it audience and let&rsquo;s see why i</p>
<p>mean can you believe i mean some people</p>
<p>just</p>
<p>they start wearing shoes and these shoes</p>
<p>are just so</p>
<p>devastating for so many problems so</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s let&rsquo;s see if this is a true or</p>
<p>false yeah absolutely all right folks uh</p>
<p>jim if you are out there he&rsquo;s coming to</p>
<p>us over the audio line jim you&rsquo;re on</p>
<p>with dr byrd</p>
<p>pleasure talking to you dr berg</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m uh</p>
<p>from canada 65 years old this is about</p>
<p>type 2 diabetes for about 30 years</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;ve been in the many different</p>
<p>pills</p>
<p>for diabetes and high cholesterol and</p>
<p>other stuff but the last</p>
<p>10 years</p>
<p>they put me in the</p>
<p>other insulin as well injection</p>
<p>but two years ago i started doing the</p>
<p>intermittent fasting 18 6</p>
<p>and doing the</p>
<p>ketos</p>
<p>and lost about 70 pounds so my blood</p>
<p>sugar everything i dropped all the</p>
<p>medication including insulin the only</p>
<p>thing i take is only one</p>
<p>syn jordan once a</p>
<p>day and</p>
<p>uh</p>
<p>in the morning my blood reading is very</p>
<p>good either between 4.7 to 5.2</p>
<p>i do maybe one or two cup of coffee and</p>
<p>lemon water till lunch time</p>
<p>at lunchtime when i do do my reading it</p>
<p>goes to six</p>
<p>to six point eight</p>
<p>this is positing me</p>
<p>okay well um you know what um</p>
<p>then then your liver must be just making</p>
<p>sugar because you&rsquo;re not eating sugar so</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re making a little bit um</p>
<p>more sugar through the gluconeogenesis</p>
<p>so um</p>
<p>this happens especially with your</p>
<p>history</p>
<p>i mean your history you&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>diabetic for quite some time and you</p>
<p>must have some insulin resistance</p>
<p>problems still</p>
<p>going on</p>
<p>with that coffee you may want to add</p>
<p>some</p>
<p>quality</p>
<p>ghee</p>
<p>as kind of like a bulletproof kind of</p>
<p>coffee and blend that into your coffee</p>
<p>of course no sweeteners and then start</p>
<p>to support your liver a little bit more</p>
<p>maybe you do milk thistle maybe in your</p>
<p>salad you do um</p>
<p>dandelion</p>
<p>greens as part of your salad arugula but</p>
<p>you want to start supporting the liver</p>
<p>to help that</p>
<p>reduce that gluconeogenesis and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>really what you&rsquo;re up against</p>
<p>the other thing i would recommend is if</p>
<p>you see your blood sugars coming up just</p>
<p>start exercising more to burn that off</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not coming from your diet so it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not as dangerous and</p>
<p>i think you&rsquo;ll be fine if you just</p>
<p>persist</p>
<p>keep improving things maybe go to one</p>
<p>meal a day</p>
<p>just to really make it work better</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what i would recommend</p>
<p>thank you i did one one uh one day uh 48</p>
<p>hours uh</p>
<p>uh intermittent fasting</p>
<p>but after 24 hours when i tested the</p>
<p>gain was around six six point something</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s your liver your liver just</p>
<p>is just taking a little bit longer</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just it&rsquo;s just a little bit longer</p>
<p>process so</p>
<p>um it&rsquo;s not coming from your diet so it</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s uh</p>
<p>your your liver just as some has more</p>
<p>insulin resistance going on and so</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>you just have to give it more time keep</p>
<p>tweaking things and uh</p>
<p>support your liver</p>
<p>thank you</p>
<p>welcome thanks for joining us uh let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>see uh before we get to quiz question</p>
<p>answer number four which has come in</p>
<p>grace from facebook would it be healthy</p>
<p>to raise a young child</p>
<p>on the keto diet i know you have an</p>
<p>opinion about that</p>
<p>i would i would that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>with my granddaughter lucy she&rsquo;s a keto</p>
<p>baby and</p>
<p>she doesn&rsquo;t do all these sugars like the</p>
<p>other kids and</p>
<p>she does do some fruit but</p>
<p>but she&rsquo;s talk about healthy talk about</p>
<p>it</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>talk about just all the cognitive uh</p>
<p>improvements that you would possibly</p>
<p>have i mean</p>
<p>i wished i knew about keto when i was a</p>
<p>kid because that would be a whole</p>
<p>different thing simply because i lived</p>
<p>on sugar so long i&rsquo;m and not just even</p>
<p>going beyond just your teeth your</p>
<p>overall strength um</p>
<p>development of</p>
<p>muscle and when you get into sports you</p>
<p>know the whole thing</p>
<p>so yeah that&rsquo;s um</p>
<p>you know and you have the sugar then you</p>
<p>have the quality of food too the</p>
<p>nutrient dense foods very very important</p>
<p>especially for a kid growing up uh you</p>
<p>want to make sure that the real food</p>
<p>which is a hard to come by so you want</p>
<p>to start getting them involved with um</p>
<p>you know really</p>
<p>with nutrition early as possible</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll you&rsquo;ll be happy you did that</p>
<p>wonderful okay</p>
<p>dr berg our question was true false</p>
<p>wearing shoes</p>
<p>increases the risk for knee pain</p>
<p>and the audience has an opinion 68 say</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s true 32 percent say no way</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s false</p>
<p>you know it does depend on the type of</p>
<p>shoe you have of course right but yes it</p>
<p>can increase your risk for knee pain</p>
<p>because what happens is um when you put</p>
<p>this foot into a shoe</p>
<p>that a lot of times your toes</p>
<p>is pointed or there&rsquo;s not enough space</p>
<p>for the toes</p>
<p>um and you&rsquo;re walking on this cushion</p>
<p>right it can and or a high heel all</p>
<p>these things can throw off your gait and</p>
<p>your muscles and your ankle around your</p>
<p>ankle your calf so i&rsquo;m going to release</p>
<p>a video on and some really interesting</p>
<p>research on what shoes do to the your</p>
<p>entire body uh if they&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>you know there&rsquo;s the the new um barefoot</p>
<p>shoes</p>
<p>type shoes where you can buy um these</p>
<p>you know flatter soles um</p>
<p>more space for your your toes i would</p>
<p>highly recommend getting those shoes</p>
<p>because the uh</p>
<p>um it gives you more stability it gets</p>
<p>your feet to work better and</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;ll reduce</p>
<p>uh stress on your knees and your hips</p>
<p>so um stay tuned for that video it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>actually very interesting</p>
<p>very good okay originally from bulgaria</p>
<p>now living in the canary islands we have</p>
<p>hang on he&rsquo;s getting ready here</p>
<p>we have uh lou bamir lubamir from the</p>
<p>canary islands lubamir you&rsquo;re on with dr</p>
<p>byrd</p>
<p>good morning</p>
<p>and thank you for having me on our show</p>
<p>absolutely my</p>
<p>question is very simple</p>
<p>but nobody is</p>
<p>telling it the the truth</p>
<p>what</p>
<p>and when</p>
<p>is the best time to get</p>
<p>ben futhermen</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s going together with alpha lipoid</p>
<p>acid</p>
<p>or they in conflict</p>
<p>so i missed the question um</p>
<p>i i didn&rsquo;t get it yeah can you say that</p>
<p>again</p>
<p>what is the best time</p>
<p>getting</p>
<p>ben footy i mean oh ben photos</p>
<p>and is it going in conflict with alpha</p>
<p>lipoid acid</p>
<p>okay so um both of those nutrients are</p>
<p>um not going to compete</p>
<p>both of them are fat soluble</p>
<p>so of course you&rsquo;d want to have them</p>
<p>with some fat</p>
<p>so if you had them with a meal that</p>
<p>would absorb a little bit better now</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say for example</p>
<p>you know there&rsquo;s other factors that</p>
<p>could affect you as well like let&rsquo;s say</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re you don&rsquo;t have enough bile</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say you have a fatty liver that</p>
<p>can also affect the production of bile</p>
<p>and the absorption so these are just</p>
<p>factors as well as inflammation in the</p>
<p>gut but typically</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re fat soluble so you&rsquo;d want to</p>
<p>have those</p>
<p>with</p>
<p>a meal or just with a little bit of fat</p>
<p>any fat it could be olive oil it could</p>
<p>be</p>
<p>saturated type fats like coconut oil</p>
<p>it could be anything cod liver oil</p>
<p>not an empty stomach</p>
<p>no no no</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t want an empty stomach</p>
<p>thank you very much god bless you thank</p>
<p>you</p>
<p>thank you</p>
<p>thank you so much lubamar and i know</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re having a blast down there in the</p>
<p>canary islands wish i was there</p>
<p>okay let&rsquo;s see um</p>
<p>oh we do have the quiz answer</p>
<p>for no we don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s see how about our</p>
<p>last question here it is dr bird</p>
<p>all right the most effective</p>
<p>response for sciatic nerve pain</p>
<p>steve i think somehow um</p>
<p>terry altered this question so i better</p>
<p>ask it correctly okay all right please</p>
<p>the most effective um</p>
<p>stretch</p>
<p>for sciatic pain is what okay folks</p>
<p>climb on it what kind of stretching do</p>
<p>we need to do to take care of that uh</p>
<p>the art of today is the</p>
<p>moniker from youtube i have sickle cell</p>
<p>anemia and i&rsquo;m suffering from with</p>
<p>constipation nausea light sensitivity</p>
<p>how can we help the art of today</p>
<p>you know</p>
<p>regarding the art of today</p>
<p>i would just get on get on the basic</p>
<p>healthy keto intermittent fasting be</p>
<p>before you start taking any remedies for</p>
<p>any of these things i would just get on</p>
<p>the right eating plan i don&rsquo;t know what</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re eating so it&rsquo;s really hard to</p>
<p>evaluate these symptoms unless i know if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re on the basic plan and what you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing so</p>
<p>i think you&rsquo;ll be surprised if you do</p>
<p>just get the basic eating back in that</p>
<p>your your body will</p>
<p>respond very very favorably i mean even</p>
<p>working with so many people</p>
<p>i can&rsquo;t tell you</p>
<p>how many of issues</p>
<p>cleared up</p>
<p>just by</p>
<p>going back to the basics and making sure</p>
<p>this person is doing it um</p>
<p>typically when someone starts keto</p>
<p>um they hear about a little bit from</p>
<p>here and then there and they they end up</p>
<p>doing it that&rsquo;s like way off the board</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s not the healthy version that</p>
<p>i recommend so</p>
<p>um you might just want to try the one</p>
<p>that i came out there and just see if</p>
<p>that works for you and then you&rsquo;ll know</p>
<p>for sure sounds great of course we had</p>
<p>ella from memphis on earlier and her</p>
<p>camera wasn&rsquo;t working but i was</p>
<p>um is not</p>
<p>did he click himself off i have no idea</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s see no i should be here doc</p>
<p>you know stand by</p>
<p>oh i know what&rsquo;s going on here</p>
<p>okay dr berg i&rsquo;m back</p>
<p>okay</p>
<p>well what about going to carol i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think we&rsquo;ve talked to carol yet we have</p>
<p>not she&rsquo;s been very patient carol let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>see here let me put you on there you are</p>
<p>on with dr</p>
<p>burke hi dr berg thank you for taking my</p>
<p>call sure</p>
<p>i started keita i started intermittent</p>
<p>fasting uh from your website in january</p>
<p>2021</p>
<p>i never went i took your recommendations</p>
<p>i never went with all the keto products</p>
<p>that are out there none of them at all i</p>
<p>had great success</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>i love it because</p>
<p>food no longer rules me i have no</p>
<p>appetite i have to say</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s time to eat</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve lost over 40 pounds everything is</p>
<p>great</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s now been</p>
<p>over a year that i do regular</p>
<p>intermittent fasting uh i probably do 18</p>
<p>to 20 hours every day</p>
<p>um but my concern is and i was watching</p>
<p>one of your videos but i think i got it</p>
<p>i think i got myself tangled up but my</p>
<p>question is i have numbness in my feet</p>
<p>that hasn&rsquo;t gone away</p>
<p>and tingling</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just in my feet nowhere else</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t keep me up at night but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s annoying all the time</p>
<p>and i think i need uh something i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know why</p>
<p>um have you ever heard of benfotamine</p>
<p>before</p>
<p>no</p>
<p>okay that&rsquo;s what you need what happens</p>
<p>is uh obviously maybe before you did</p>
<p>keto you you probably had insulin</p>
<p>resistance to the point</p>
<p>where your um</p>
<p>your</p>
<p>red blood cells were kind of stiff</p>
<p>and they didn&rsquo;t really they don&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>go on too deep into the capillaries in</p>
<p>the extremities</p>
<p>and the most extremity</p>
<p>um part of your body is your feet so</p>
<p>um you&rsquo;re just left with a lack of</p>
<p>circulation to the nerves so now we have</p>
<p>to get that back</p>
<p>so the remedy that works really good is</p>
<p>benfotamine you can buy it anywhere and</p>
<p>you would want to take four of those</p>
<p>pills a day</p>
<p>spread out and the gentleman already</p>
<p>asked about should we have them with</p>
<p>meals well maybe you just have a little</p>
<p>bit of mct oil with it</p>
<p>and you have four times a day</p>
<p>and sometimes people add lipoic acid uh</p>
<p>you can do that but benfotamine is a</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of a no-brainer that should</p>
<p>give you relief um over a period of a</p>
<p>week you should start seeing change and</p>
<p>that will just feed the nerve</p>
<p>that um</p>
<p>that b1 in the fat soluble form that</p>
<p>penetrates the myelin sheath and helps</p>
<p>build up</p>
<p>the connective uh insulation so you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have that uh short circuiting</p>
<p>anymore</p>
<p>yeah okay and you said four pills a day</p>
<p>is that like</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>milligrams or i mean i think they come</p>
<p>in like 300 milligrams so you would take</p>
<p>four of those a day and</p>
<p>you know</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just a rough um recommendation it</p>
<p>could be a little bit less a little bit</p>
<p>more but um</p>
<p>i think um</p>
<p>that will solve your problem nicely</p>
<p>awesome thank you so much you&rsquo;re welcome</p>
<p>thanks a lot carol we appreciate it by</p>
<p>the way dr berg i&rsquo;d cut my volume off on</p>
<p>whitney when i put that nice picture of</p>
<p>the baby and mama up and i was just</p>
<p>trying to show them off that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>reason i brought up there but anyway i</p>
<p>should stick to the script and not do</p>
<p>that because i cut my volume off and</p>
<p>doing it anyway we have the answer to</p>
<p>the final quiz question today</p>
<p>which asks the most effective response</p>
<p>for sciatic nerve pain is a dot dot dot</p>
<p>and 75 say leg stretches and 25 say</p>
<p>lower back stretches</p>
<p>yeah the lower back stretch because you</p>
<p>remember you want to put this curve back</p>
<p>in so the goal is to stretch in the area</p>
<p>to put the curve back in your lower back</p>
<p>so if you were to lay on a</p>
<p>firm</p>
<p>foam roller to the point where you can</p>
<p>push this curve back in there and do</p>
<p>that for 20 minutes a day that is</p>
<p>probably going to give you the most</p>
<p>relief versus trying to stretch your</p>
<p>legs because if you start doing</p>
<p>hamstring stretches you&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to aggravate it because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s already going down the back of your</p>
<p>leg so it&rsquo;s like inflamed and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>just going to pull it</p>
<p>you can stretch the front part of your</p>
<p>legs that will help you but i think</p>
<p>putting that curve back in is going to</p>
<p>give you the best thing not just for</p>
<p>sciatica but for</p>
<p>low back pain</p>
<p>all right so that&rsquo;s great for that</p>
<p>video too great okay joy from new york</p>
<p>city just popped up on our screen i</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t had time to brief her joy can</p>
<p>you hear us</p>
<p>um yes can you hear me sure can would</p>
<p>you go ahead with your question for dr</p>
<p>bird</p>
<p>yes hi i am i&rsquo;m suffering with the</p>
<p>condition pcos</p>
<p>um</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>it comes with</p>
<p>ibs</p>
<p>and um</p>
<p>i went to the doctor for my stomach</p>
<p>issues not realizing it was related to</p>
<p>the pcos</p>
<p>and how i found out is i went to a</p>
<p>acupuncture doctor and he diagnosed me</p>
<p>with the polycystic ovarian syndrome</p>
<p>and as i looked it up and as time went</p>
<p>by</p>
<p>all of the other issues that i had was</p>
<p>related to that condition but now i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>suffering with i i don&rsquo;t know if i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>having gallbladder issues</p>
<p>i know i have liver issues because he</p>
<p>said my insulin was borderline diabetic</p>
<p>but it wasn&rsquo;t diabetic yet it was</p>
<p>pre-diabetic</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very hard for me to travel because</p>
<p>of my digestive issues</p>
<p>i recently spoke to a lady who does</p>
<p>fertility cleanses to help women learn</p>
<p>how to um you know have children and she</p>
<p>suggested that i do a fertility cleanse</p>
<p>that had a liver cleanse in it and then</p>
<p>a hormonal cleanse</p>
<p>um but my my issues are like i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>really know if</p>
<p>if i should start one at a time</p>
<p>yeah um</p>
<p>you know i don&rsquo;t want to take a million</p>
<p>things at the same time if i need to</p>
<p>think take something one at a time then</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m okay with that and as far as my</p>
<p>gallbladder is concerned i&rsquo;m scared</p>
<p>because i&rsquo;ve never had this issue before</p>
<p>yeah okay so i can give you some really</p>
<p>good advice because</p>
<p>your problem is is not toxins</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have toxins that&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>creating a problem your problem is that</p>
<p>your insulin</p>
<p>is too high and that makes your</p>
<p>androgens go too high so polycystic</p>
<p>ovarian is a condition where you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just making too many uh male</p>
<p>hormone type things it&rsquo;s like androgens</p>
<p>are too high coming from</p>
<p>this one source which is a spike in</p>
<p>insulin so</p>
<p>the most powerful thing you can do is</p>
<p>not a cleanse or a detox but just to</p>
<p>start to eat</p>
<p>to reduce insulin and there&rsquo;s two things</p>
<p>two very important things to reduce</p>
<p>insulin one is to go on a very low carb</p>
<p>diet and that&rsquo;s the keto healthy keto</p>
<p>which i think you need to</p>
<p>go on my website and get that data and</p>
<p>number two this is equally important</p>
<p>uh start doing intermittent fasting at</p>
<p>the same time because that&rsquo;s gonna</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s gonna act as a very powerful</p>
<p>thing to lower your</p>
<p>insulin which is then going to lower</p>
<p>your androgens and you&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>become more fertile and guess what your</p>
<p>digestive system will finally have a</p>
<p>chance to reset because you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>eating so frequently</p>
<p>so i think you can kill two birds with</p>
<p>one stone by doing the</p>
<p>healthy keto and intermittent fasting um</p>
<p>okay it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have i mean i wouldn&rsquo;t load up</p>
<p>on a bunch of supplements and do</p>
<p>different programs because</p>
<p>the basic problem needs to be</p>
<p>fixed through your</p>
<p>diet and then</p>
<p>then see if you have any problems left i</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;ll probably</p>
<p>help you with both of these problems</p>
<p>pretty dramatically i didn&rsquo;t if you look</p>
<p>at some of my other videos with pcos</p>
<p>i interviewed a naturopathic doctor um</p>
<p>and she had pcos she wrote a book about</p>
<p>it and there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>i mean she just gets one success story</p>
<p>after another um so try to find that</p>
<p>interview but that&rsquo;ll just confirm what</p>
<p>i just told you</p>
<p>okay okay that is so awesome</p>
<p>yeah absolutely well joy i&rsquo;m glad we</p>
<p>were able to bring you on we&rsquo;re about</p>
<p>out of time but dr berg maybe just one</p>
<p>shout out about your constant effort to</p>
<p>bring your products uh more easily and</p>
<p>affordably around the world</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re in europe if you&rsquo;re in saudi</p>
<p>arabia if you&rsquo;re in</p>
<p>russia anywhere</p>
<p>there should be some links down below</p>
<p>that way you can avoid the expensive</p>
<p>shipping we&rsquo;re trying to</p>
<p>make it easier to get with all the extra</p>
<p>added expenses of shipping across the us</p>
<p>on that note</p>
<p>i really appreciate all of your</p>
<p>wonderful comments and</p>
