<p>carbohydrates in the muscle was the</p>
<p>single notice the single factor</p>
<p>determining athletic performance Wow and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s how it was projected to all of us</p>
<p>and said I&rsquo;m a young student studying</p>
<p>physiology in medicine and I&rsquo;m running</p>
<p>marathons and I discovered this and it</p>
<p>this is the most exciting piece of</p>
<p>information I I heard in the whole</p>
<p>medical training so I was started</p>
<p>promoting this high carbohydrate diet in</p>
<p>the 1980 1970s and I said then of course</p>
<p>adopted that diet and then I went to did</p>
<p>my medical training completed my medical</p>
<p>training I was surrounded by</p>
<p>cardiologists it was so telling us that</p>
<p>if you eat fat you&rsquo;re gonna die so I was</p>
<p>gonna eat lots of carbohydrate and it</p>
<p>was gonna make me run better well in</p>
<p>fact it made me run worse and I got</p>
<p>fatter and progressively sicker and then</p>
<p>in 1970 1981 my father was diagnosed</p>
<p>with type 2 diabetes and he died 10</p>
<p>years later and eventually I discovered</p>
<p>that I also had type 2 diabetes and I</p>
<p>realized I&rsquo;ve got 10 years to solve this</p>
<p>problem</p>
<p>or else I&rsquo;m gonna die like he did and</p>
<p>that fortunately he forced me to look</p>
<p>very seriously into the what was going</p>
<p>on in the evidence and I came across a</p>
<p>book called the new Atkins for the new</p>
<p>for a new year written by doctors</p>
<p>Westman boney verlag and Finney and</p>
<p>within two hours of reading that book I</p>
<p>said oh my gosh I got it completely</p>
<p>wrong for 33 years Wow in two hours I&rsquo;d</p>
<p>changed I started changing my diet and</p>
<p>with the results were spectacular</p>
<p>and I haven&rsquo;t looked back for seven and</p>
<p>a half years so that&rsquo;s how it all</p>
<p>started and then initially I was very</p>
<p>reluctant say anything about it because</p>
<p>I knew that their backlash and I knew</p>
<p>that I would be vilified that I didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>realize extent to which I&rsquo;d be vilified</p>
<p>cautious initially but then eventually</p>
<p>it came out and then the problems arose</p>
<p>and then my fat mine my colleagues</p>
<p>attacked me and that&rsquo;s been seven years</p>
<p>of attacks yeah I I saw that that was</p>
<p>ridiculous do you know do you find that</p>
<p>um these the more educated someone is</p>
<p>educated the harder it is for them to</p>
<p>learn new concepts new ideas that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>really good question what I discovered</p>
<p>was that the academics in hospital</p>
<p>practice are the ones who are most</p>
<p>ingrained because they&rsquo;ve been bought by</p>
<p>the pharmaceutical industry and what</p>
<p>they say is controlled by industry</p>
<p>although they don&rsquo;t understand it and so</p>
<p>they are the ones who are really really</p>
<p>tough the the guys aren&rsquo;t in general</p>
<p>practice the academics and that the the</p>
<p>doctors in general practice are much</p>
<p>more open because they&rsquo;ve gotta treat</p>
<p>patients and make them better but if you</p>
<p>work in a hospital it actually the page</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have a sort of direct</p>
<p>relationship you see all these thousands</p>
<p>of people but you don&rsquo;t have a direct</p>
<p>person-to-person relationship with the</p>
<p>individual patients but if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>running your own private practice you do</p>
<p>so so what&rsquo;s going to happen is that the</p>
<p>change is going to occur in in the</p>
<p>private sector of medicine with where</p>
<p>doctors have to face up to their</p>
<p>patients but in the public sector</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s still a long way to go</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s so much resistant to</p>
<p>change oh yeah I know I run into it all</p>
<p>the time I want to talk about your you</p>
<p>wrote this book on water log which is</p>
<p>faster than me because there&rsquo;s this</p>
<p>whole I don&rsquo;t know it&rsquo;s like one of</p>
<p>those things that everyone knows that</p>
<p>you need to drink a lot of water or</p>
<p>drink or water keep drinking water where</p>
<p>did this come from is it just made up</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a great question because again</p>
<p>when I started running we used to run</p>
<p>marathons and you allowed one drink sort</p>
<p>of thing that was what you Wow I can and</p>
<p>and you had to provide your own own</p>
<p>drinks and in fact that was one of the</p>
<p>first things I also started activating</p>
<p>on so when I was running I was telling</p>
<p>the authorities now you must give us</p>
<p>more drinks for our races and within ten</p>
<p>years it changed dramatically and then</p>
<p>from getting a drink every like 15 or 20</p>
<p>kilometers that&rsquo;s what Aborigine was it</p>
<p>came down to every mile every 1.6</p>
<p>kilometers that you were drinking</p>
<p>Wow and then then what happened was the</p>
<p>sports drink industry took off and they</p>
<p>made sure that they were gonna drive</p>
<p>this and so various companies one in</p>
<p>particular which we won&rsquo;t name and shame</p>
<p>at this stage because it&rsquo;s fall in the</p>
<p>book anyone can read it right but this</p>
<p>one particular company realized that</p>
<p>actually the marathon runners aren&rsquo;t the</p>
<p>ones you&rsquo;re going to drink all their</p>
<p>drinks it&rsquo;s the person going to the gym</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve got to be able to tell the</p>
<p>person going to the gym that if they do</p>
<p>one minute exercise they could die if</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t drink and that&rsquo;s the message</p>
<p>they got out Wow and it it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>unbelievable but they didn&rsquo;t said that</p>
<p>dehydration is a disease and it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a biological response as you know</p>
<p>they said the iteration is a disease and</p>
<p>if you become dehydrated you can die and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s going to affect your performance</p>
<p>and so they Maynard managed to sell this</p>
<p>to millions and millions and millions of</p>
<p>people who working out in the gym for 10</p>
<p>minutes that they must drink a lot and</p>
<p>so on and so that&rsquo;s what happened but</p>
<p>then when you transfer that to marathon</p>
<p>running and you tell people to drink</p>
<p>ahead of thirst and you provided so much</p>
<p>fluid during these races because</p>
<p>remember</p>
<p>there was nowhere else in the world</p>
<p>where you could get so much free fluid</p>
<p>for the four or five hours that you ran</p>
<p>a marathon you could drink and drink and</p>
<p>drink and of course people over drank</p>
<p>and and sundown and we predicted that it</p>
<p>would be an American female runner who</p>
<p>would die and that happened in 1993 it</p>
<p>was absolutely as we had predicted Wow</p>
<p>so so that was its again it was industry</p>
<p>industry brainwashed people to believe</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s again the problem we have</p>
<p>with on nutrition story industry</p>
<p>brainwashed us to believe certain things</p>
<p>just simply not true okay for those of</p>
<p>you are watching what we&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about is when you drink too much water</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna dilute certain electrolytes</p>
<p>specially potassium and what&rsquo;s gonna</p>
<p>happen is you need potassium for the</p>
<p>heart to work to balance fluids in the</p>
<p>brain so if you drink too much water</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s called hyponatremia right and your</p>
<p>brain can swell it can really be</p>
<p>dangerous and it can die and there at</p>
<p>least 15 days in runners and triathletes</p>
<p>and and particularly in the military</p>
<p>which is really interesting because that</p>
<p>the biggest incidence has been in the</p>
<p>military and they finally finally find</p>
<p>it this year so that we describe the</p>
<p>condition in 1981 and now it&rsquo;s 2018 the</p>
<p>first time in in history the US military</p>
<p>said if a patient comes in and you think</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve got a heat illness and they</p>
<p>confused you may not give them fluids</p>
<p>until you measure the blood sodium</p>
<p>concentration mother that in 1985 or 86</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s how long it takes for change to</p>
<p>occur so just so you guys know doctor</p>
<p>Professor Noakes is the key the top</p>
<p>researcher on this data exercise</p>
<p>associated hyponatremia you&rsquo;ve done us</p>
<p>some articles on this research a lot</p>
<p>right yeah we were the first to describe</p>
<p>that it occurred in a lady in the 1981</p>
<p>comrades marathon which is a 90</p>
<p>kilometer 56 mile race in South Africa</p>
<p>and she wrote to me after the race</p>
<p>because she&rsquo;d been unconscious for four</p>
<p>days so here she starts this race</p>
<p>completely healthy and then she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>unconscious and she wrote to me a week</p>
<p>later or so when she&rsquo;d regained</p>
<p>she said what happened she said no</p>
<p>sodium went down and so then we knew the</p>
<p>hyponatremia that was the first case and</p>
<p>we connected a whole series of cases and</p>
<p>just by talking to the patient&rsquo;s you</p>
<p>could see that they drank a lot and</p>
<p>there was clear evidence that one of</p>
<p>them for example was a lady with</p>
<p>anorexia nervosa who was very sensitive</p>
<p>about her weight and she said but you</p>
<p>know profile put on four kilograms</p>
<p>during this Ironman and I knew I had to</p>
<p>believe her because she would be you</p>
<p>know she would know what your weight</p>
<p>change was and another guy told me he&rsquo;d</p>
<p>passed like about six liters of urine in</p>
<p>recoveries and so then we were getting</p>
<p>an idea then we did as we did an</p>
<p>investigation of we hospitalized eight</p>
<p>patients with the condition these people</p>
<p>near death in the comrades marathon and</p>
<p>we recovery study them during recovery</p>
<p>and we could show that they all passed</p>
<p>an excess of urine and that average of</p>
<p>the worst case was a guy who had</p>
<p>excreted six liters of extra fluid so</p>
<p>he&rsquo;d increased his body weight by six</p>
<p>kilograms so then we knew and we</p>
<p>published that paper in the year in the</p>
<p>Journal of applied physiology and I</p>
<p>thought well that&rsquo;s the end we proved</p>
<p>what causes it it&rsquo;s gonna go away well</p>
<p>actually no because they were scientists</p>
<p>who were being encouraged to say that</p>
<p>this was nonsensical research and</p>
<p>dehydration is the real problem and if</p>
<p>you tell people that under drink they&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>all die of dehydration now that was the</p>
<p>argument and industry was driving it and</p>
<p>then the American College of Sports</p>
<p>Medicine brought up the new guidelines</p>
<p>in 1996 and they said you must drink ale</p>
<p>assist essentially to drink as much as</p>
<p>tolerable that was the ruling there was</p>
<p>the advice and there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>biology that that tells you that you</p>
<p>must drink to as much as tolerable right</p>
<p>so we have to drink more drink more</p>
<p>thirsty right that&rsquo;s the common sense</p>
<p>type solution and that&rsquo;s how all animals</p>
<p>drink and so wash it humans be different</p>
<p>but we because we got this brain and we</p>
<p>think we must do something with the</p>
<p>brain well they&rsquo;re actually the body</p>
<p>will tell you what to do exactly since</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re talking about fluids what about</p>
<p>long distance</p>
<p>running and electrolytes and cramping</p>
<p>but in some of your books can you</p>
<p>touch on that yeah well we did quite a</p>
<p>lot of studies to try and see if people</p>
<p>who have cramping were dehydrated or</p>
<p>lost more sodium or we&rsquo;re at low</p>
<p>sodium&rsquo;s and we never found it however</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s remarkable that many people benefit</p>
<p>by taking salt and so so this is the</p>
<p>paradox that we can&rsquo;t show that you have</p>
<p>a salt deficiency if you&rsquo;re cramping and</p>
<p>certainly when you go on the high-fat</p>
<p>diet a lot of people complain bitterly</p>
<p>of cramping and we told him but the salt</p>
<p>won&rsquo;t make any difference but it does</p>
<p>make a difference so so the things about</p>
<p>salt that we don&rsquo;t understand and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>really it&rsquo;s good because if you read</p>
<p>waterlogged you&rsquo;ll see I give all the</p>
<p>evidence and there&rsquo;s plenty of evidence</p>
<p>that you it&rsquo;s impossible it comes out in</p>
<p>deficient today yet some people benefit</p>
<p>by taking salt so and some people run</p>
<p>better when they take more salt so there</p>
<p>are things that we don&rsquo;t fully</p>
<p>understand God again it&rsquo;s just like</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re all an experiment of one and and</p>
<p>we just have to experiment and you know</p>
<p>follow the general rules and then so the</p>
<p>general rule is that most people that</p>
<p>need additional salt when they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>running but some people got cramping</p>
<p>will may find it beneficial</p>
<p>how about magnesium and potassium I</p>
<p>think those go together with salt so</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve probably if you are problem</p>
<p>suffering from cramping I certainly</p>
<p>would advise you to try those three and</p>
<p>particularly if you&rsquo;re on a high-fat</p>
<p>diet because there&rsquo;s a lot of reports of</p>
<p>people really benefiting on a high-fat</p>
<p>diet and they clearly become salt</p>
<p>deficient but I bet if you tasted them</p>
<p>you wouldn&rsquo;t find it but they that</p>
<p>benefit from salt and potassium and</p>
<p>magnesium but but it&rsquo;s but a general</p>
<p>rule is you probably don&rsquo;t need it but</p>
<p>some people will benefit from it yeah I</p>
<p>mean you also have the situation where</p>
<p>like most dissolve but most of the</p>
<p>potassium is inside the cell which is</p>
<p>sometimes it&rsquo;s hard to test that because</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re checking the blood you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>checking intracellular minerals so it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>kind of um it might not show up in the</p>
<p>blood</p>
<p>or X exterior to the cell yeah sodium&rsquo;s</p>
<p>anyone that really does show up in the</p>
<p>inner bloodstream yeah</p>
<p>so let&rsquo;s touch on um this common thing</p>
<p>that people cut up like athletes that</p>
<p>keep asking me yes but if I lower my</p>
<p>carbs I&rsquo;ll lower my performance when I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>working out or I&rsquo;m doing athletic</p>
<p>activities can you touch on that yeah</p>
<p>okay I think that we have to realize</p>
<p>that 99.9% of everyone of athletes or</p>
<p>recreational athletes and that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>point so when we talk about the point</p>
<p>one percent two competing Olympics at</p>
<p>short distances say up to two five or</p>
<p>ten kilometers yes I think there may</p>
<p>well be a role for for some</p>
<p>carbohydrates in them but for the</p>
<p>recreational athletes really if you run</p>
<p>a minute faster or a minute slow is not</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not important what&rsquo;s important is</p>
<p>your long-term health and what worries</p>
<p>me is that there are a lot of athletes</p>
<p>like myself who eat a high carbohydrate</p>
<p>diet and then damage themselves for life</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s the issue so you if you can</p>
<p>tolerate carbohydrates and you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>insulin resistant and you&rsquo;re not heading</p>
<p>towards diabetes like I was yes eat a</p>
<p>little bit more carbohydrate but you</p>
<p>only need 200 or 250 grams a day I mean</p>
<p>if you go back and read some of my early</p>
<p>books you&rsquo;ll see we were telling people</p>
<p>to eat a kilogram Wow there was there</p>
<p>was in the Tour de France and I mean</p>
<p>that is that is murder you want to kill</p>
<p>people give them a kilogram wow that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>lot yes a lot so I think I think you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>find that today a high carbohydrate diet</p>
<p>for a Tour de France cyclists</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s probably 300 grams or 350 grams and</p>
<p>that they are burning most of the energy</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re burning is coming from fats</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s critically important to remember</p>
<p>most of the energy when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>exercising is coming from fat not from</p>
<p>carbohydrate Wow</p>
<p>so if you&rsquo;re doing an ultra marathon for</p>
<p>example what should a person should eat</p>
<p>anything in that process that&rsquo;s a great</p>
<p>question and answers if you carbohydrate</p>
<p>adapted you</p>
<p>have to eat carbohydrate and because</p>
<p>otherwise you&rsquo;re gonna run into trouble</p>
<p>because you see what people don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>understand is if your carbohydrate</p>
<p>adapted you&rsquo;re metabolically crippled</p>
<p>and no one tells you that you see okay</p>
<p>sure you might be able to sprint a</p>
<p>little bit more up one or two hills but</p>
<p>when it comes to a long slog over four</p>
<p>or five hours you&rsquo;ve got to burn fat and</p>
<p>the the well-trained elite athletes can</p>
<p>burn 1.6 1.8 grams of carbohydrate a</p>
<p>minute whereas if you are carbohydrate</p>
<p>adapted you burning 0.6 and that&rsquo;s it a</p>
<p>third a third one when you gone a couple</p>
<p>of hours and you&rsquo;re into you you&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>reduced your carbohydrates and now</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve got to burn fat the guy who&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>is carbohydrate adapted just hasn&rsquo;t got</p>
<p>the energy and and I think actually the</p>
<p>most most ultra distance runners even as</p>
<p>they eating a higher carbohydrate that</p>
<p>are probably fed adapted because they do</p>
<p>a lot of training in a set typically at</p>
<p>a carbohydrate depleted state because if</p>
<p>they wouldn&rsquo;t they couldn&rsquo;t do what they</p>
<p>do right they don&rsquo;t understand that they</p>
<p>are actually significantly fed adapted</p>
<p>even though that evening or they think</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re eating a high carbohydrate diet</p>
<p>fascinating and so you tap out the</p>
<p>glycogen Reserve and then they hit this</p>
<p>sometimes I hit this wall call it the</p>
<p>bark or something correct and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>when you want to be burning fat and then</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;ve fed adapted you can just carry</p>
<p>on all day so you to answer your first</p>
<p>question if you probably fell adapted do</p>
<p>you need to eat I&rsquo;m just rewriting law</p>
<p>running and I&rsquo;m going back to read all</p>
<p>the old stuff again and one of the great</p>
<p>runners was a check with Austin Newton</p>
<p>he really started the ultra distance</p>
<p>running he&rsquo;s a father of ultra distance</p>
<p>running and I&rsquo;m reading again what he</p>
<p>used to eat and they were all eating</p>
<p>lots of meat and a little carbohydrate</p>
<p>and in the race say down a big break was</p>
<p>a big English breakfast and he&rsquo;d run and</p>
<p>halfway through the race he&rsquo;d stop and</p>
<p>he&rsquo;d have a meat based food that was</p>
<p>what they used to eat and but Betty and</p>
<p>then they they did take some</p>
<p>carbohydrate in butter sugar in the</p>
<p>sugary drinks but that was it they</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t stop and eat bananas and potatoes</p>
<p>and apples and things they did have</p>
<p>sugary drinks abuse et with added sugar</p>
<p>but this the main sustenance for them</p>
<p>was a high protein high fat meal before</p>
<p>and in fact during the races</p>
<p>then I&rsquo;m as I and Bruce Fordyce and</p>
<p>Bernhard raise the three of us we were</p>
<p>the first to develop degrees in South</p>
<p>Africa Murray :</p>
<p>I remember Ward us raise an axe and say</p>
<p>we because here we were you know you</p>
<p>need all that carbohydrate and so and we</p>
<p>make people take all this carbohydrate</p>
<p>and and we were right in the sense that</p>
<p>if you carbohydrate a death did you need</p>
<p>it that if you fat adapted you have to</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t need it and the irony is all</p>
<p>three of us are insulin resistant all</p>
<p>three of us got fat all three of us now</p>
<p>eat a high fat dot and eschew the</p>
<p>carbohydrates oh my gosh I didn&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>oh my gosh that is ironic and then the</p>
<p>other question I have there&rsquo;s another</p>
<p>concept that if you eat too much fat</p>
<p>people are gonna say this will aren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>gonna increase my cholesterol am I gonna</p>
<p>die of a heart attack can you touch on</p>
<p>that point</p>
<p>yeah well I&rsquo;m glad to saw you also</p>
<p>question because I would encourage</p>
<p>everyone to go to the third to health VI</p>
<p>or ta health website and where the</p>
<p>health is just completed the first year</p>
<p>of a two or three year study in which</p>
<p>they feared high-fat diets to diabetics</p>
<p>now okay so diabetics are the sickest</p>
<p>people on earth they are given the worst</p>
<p>thought possible they told eat lots of</p>
<p>fat and lots of protein and cut the cost</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a a recipe for utter disaster</p>
<p>yes I guess for that you mean you just</p>
<p>you said no car you mean high carb I</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t mean like oh sorry sorry</p>
<p>yeah I&rsquo;m just using this so technically</p>
<p>according to all our knowledge they</p>
<p>trade they&rsquo;re the most dangerous diet to</p>
<p>the unhealthiest people concurrent it</p>
<p>must be a disaster they must all dropped</p>
<p>it right well it was they done they</p>
<p>actually get better and</p>
<p>percent put their diabetes into</p>
<p>remission but more importantly they</p>
<p>measure 24 markers of cardiovascular</p>
<p>health 24 mask markers 23 improved more</p>
<p>in the high fat group than in the</p>
<p>conventional treated group eating a high</p>
<p>carbohydrate diet only different only</p>
<p>one was cholesterol the so called class</p>
<p>on cholesterol has no predictive value</p>
<p>in heart disease anyway you got a look</p>
<p>at the package so what they showed you</p>
<p>take the sickest people you give them</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re supposed to the most toxic diet</p>
<p>you possibly can and 23 of 24 markers of</p>
<p>cardiovascular disease improve and the</p>
<p>only one that doesn&rsquo;t improve is the one</p>
<p>that is emit is immaterial anyway so</p>
<p>that to me that&rsquo;s the kind of the final</p>
<p>answer to this to this problem yes</p>
<p>indeed your cholesterol may go up but</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s probably a good thing rather than</p>
<p>a bad thing because everything else is</p>
<p>going to improve so we don&rsquo;t focus on</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s not important focus on all the</p>
<p>other stuff which is important yeah</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s right and just four people are</p>
<p>watching you have to realize that your</p>
<p>body makes cholesterol makes it 3,000</p>
<p>milligrams a day so it&rsquo;s a necessary</p>
<p>part of our physiology we need that</p>
<p>cellular membranes hormones repair all</p>
<p>sorts of things it&rsquo;s probably the most</p>
<p>important chemical in the body and some</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s wanted to try and stop us making it</p>
<p>oh my great friends very hard come says</p>
<p>the liver makes cholesterol it doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>want to try to kill you it&rsquo;s trying to</p>
<p>keep you alive that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s making</p>
<p>cholesterol</p>
<p>Wow yeah yeah because I do a lot of</p>
<p>YouTube videos and I think one of where</p>
<p>I get a lot of my material as I go to</p>
<p>the mainstream push of whatever they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>pushing and I go to the exact opposite</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re gonna find the truth because</p>
<p>everything they&rsquo;re promoting is it turns</p>
<p>out to be completely utterly wrong so</p>
<p>they give me a lot of good material to</p>
<p>educate people in reverse and then the</p>
<p>talks on let&rsquo;s talk about insulin</p>
<p>resistance I think this plays in with</p>
<p>what you just said yeah and you can just</p>
<p>touch on what it is and then what why</p>
<p>fat will actually benefit someone</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s insulin resistance yeah so</p>
<p>instant resistance to me is the name</p>
<p>human condition for many populations you</p>
<p>know that I say that reservedly because</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have the data to prove it but</p>
<p>but I think that if you have grown if a</p>
<p>population has grown up eating a</p>
<p>high-protein high-fat low-carbohydrate</p>
<p>diet</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ll have to be instant resistant and</p>
<p>we know that mothers get more insulin</p>
<p>resistant during pregnancy and we knew</p>
<p>the babies are in some resistant the</p>
<p>fetuses insulin resistance when it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>born so so it&rsquo;s kind of in our genes and</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s happened in the last 40 or 50</p>
<p>years is that we&rsquo;ve taken mothers and</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve fed force-fed and carbohydrate</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re during their pregnancy that makes</p>
<p>them more insulin resistant the fetus is</p>
<p>born more insulin resistant and then we</p>
<p>wean them onto high carbohydrate diets</p>
<p>and that makes the child even more</p>
<p>insulin resistance so the high</p>
<p>carbohydrate diets are pushing us to</p>
<p>become more and more and more insulin</p>
<p>resistance what that what is that you</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t metabolize carbohydrates properly</p>
<p>so in my case if I take carbohydrates my</p>
<p>glucose shoots up my insulin shoots up</p>
<p>and the insulin doesn&rsquo;t work properly it</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t get the glucose into my tissues so</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got less muscle glycogen which of</p>
<p>course is profoundly ironic because</p>
<p>yellow was telling all these fat runners</p>
<p>to eat lots of carbohydrate and they</p>
<p>would they couldn&rsquo;t get rid of the</p>
<p>carbohydrate into the muscles they&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>convert it to fats and it wasn&rsquo;t helping</p>
<p>them anyway so you can&rsquo;t metabolize the</p>
<p>carbohydrate and the instant doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>work properly and it just gets worse</p>
<p>every time you take in carbohydrate you</p>
<p>over secrete insulin the insulin doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>work and it makes the system just get</p>
<p>worse and worse and worse and the kid</p>
<p>and you never burn fat because you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>always trying to get rid of all this</p>
<p>carbohydrate you&rsquo;re eating and so any</p>
<p>fat that you ingest has to be stored</p>
<p>because you can&rsquo;t burn it because</p>
<p>insulin prevents the burning of the fat</p>
<p>and then the incident turns out is toxic</p>
<p>on almost all body tissues so the body&rsquo;s</p>
<p>trying to protect the overdose of</p>
<p>insulin and sugar by developing instant</p>
<p>resistance is trying to tell us hey stop</p>
<p>consuming so many carbohydrates yeah and</p>
<p>if that&rsquo;s what it takes the carbohydrate</p>
<p>store the fat so initially it&rsquo;s okay</p>
<p>because you just get</p>
<p>the subcutaneous tissues but then you</p>
<p>put a little bit of that fat in the</p>
<p>liver or in the pancreas and then you</p>
<p>become even more insulin resistant and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when you tip over into diabetes</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just one of those obvious things</p>
<p>that sits like the elephant in the room</p>
<p>that if you lower your carbs increase</p>
<p>your fat fat has the least effect on</p>
<p>insulin you&rsquo;re gonna actually help</p>
<p>insulin resistance and yeah so it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>seven oh my gosh it&rsquo;s crazy it makes no</p>
<p>sense that if you can&rsquo;t tolerate</p>
<p>carbohydrate that you encourage the</p>
<p>carbohydrate so forth only we the</p>
<p>evidence is coming through that and in</p>
<p>fact the first the way people with type</p>
<p>one diabetes where you don&rsquo;t secrete any</p>
<p>insulin they were treated on low</p>
<p>carbohydrate diets in the 1920s before</p>
<p>in soon was available and there was the</p>
<p>only way you could get people to live</p>
<p>any longer was not feeding either but we</p>
<p>kind of forgot that wow I didn&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s it that&rsquo;s interesting it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like wow it&rsquo;s just as amazing um what</p>
<p>happened was an instant came along and</p>
<p>then the guys thought we&rsquo;ve cured the</p>
<p>disease so you can eat what you like and</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll give you money and says then and</p>
<p>then other problems are that instant</p>
<p>drops of glucose so doctors the worst</p>
<p>thing they fear is that you drop your</p>
<p>insulin your glucose it&rsquo;s a rule it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>better to run at a higher glucose and</p>
<p>then there&rsquo;s more there&rsquo;s less danger</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;ll get a hypoglycemic attack</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s the problem because the</p>
<p>hyperglycemia is caused by too much</p>
<p>insulin so they&rsquo;re really their focus on</p>
<p>this hypoglycemia but they&rsquo;re kinda</p>
<p>ignoring the hyperinsulinemia problem</p>
<p>which is just as damaging as the high</p>
<p>sugar it&rsquo;s in fact it&rsquo;s yeah and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>yeah Wow so what type of um interesting</p>
<p>activities research are you currently</p>
<p>doing right now in your lab or your</p>
<p>office</p>
<p>yeah I&rsquo;m Sandra tired but we have a</p>
<p>foundation the Noakes Foundation and we</p>
<p>tried to fund research in and my</p>
<p>interest services and diabetes and we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>just gearing up now for a study of</p>
<p>people who are reversing their diabetes</p>
<p>so over the years we developed a</p>
<p>laboratory where we could study pretty</p>
<p>much the old metallo</p>
<p>of the human body and we&rsquo;ve just added</p>
<p>measurements of liver glucose production</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s what really goes wrong in</p>
<p>diabetes is you over produce glucose so</p>
<p>we can now essentially measure</p>
<p>everything we need to measure in</p>
<p>diabetic patients so we&rsquo;re taking a</p>
<p>large sample of about 40 people with</p>
<p>diabetes and we&rsquo;re measuring their</p>
<p>metabolism before we put on the invent</p>
<p>intervention which is a low carbohydrate</p>
<p>diet and then of that 40 we&rsquo;re hoping</p>
<p>60% will reverse and then we&rsquo;ll see what</p>
<p>has changed in that group so then we&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>understand the biology of reversal which</p>
<p>no one has studied yet so we know that</p>
<p>you can reverse I use that word</p>
<p>carefully because you&rsquo;re not really</p>
<p>healed you still can&rsquo;t eat a high</p>
<p>carbohydrate diet so you&rsquo;re in remission</p>
<p>in the sense so we&rsquo;re trying to see what</p>
<p>happens with in remission and we think</p>
<p>that we will show that the liver glucose</p>
<p>metabolism is normalized which which</p>
<p>would be crucial and in that world sure</p>
<p>okay so that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s the problem in</p>
<p>diabetes is that it&rsquo;s the liver glucose</p>
<p>production gets goes wrong and these are</p>
<p>the reasons why that happens</p>
<p>so we&rsquo;ve being intensive research on</p>
<p>that but the other thing that a lot of</p>
<p>people ask is well if there&rsquo;s low</p>
<p>carbohydrate diets healthy and good but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very expensive and that actually is</p>
<p>not true so that in South Africa as in</p>
<p>in the United States the people who got</p>
<p>the biggest diabetes problem or the</p>
<p>poorest because they have the worst food</p>
<p>choices and we&rsquo;ve shown that in South</p>
<p>Africa you can you can live quite well</p>
<p>on three dollars a day you can eat well</p>
<p>on three dollars a day and we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>developed arts for three dollars a day</p>
<p>now we&rsquo;re about to do a major</p>
<p>intervention of 200 people where we put</p>
<p>them on a three dollar a day diet Wow</p>
<p>see what happens and the these are</p>
<p>people who are sick they&rsquo;ve got diabetes</p>
<p>high blood pressure and we know that</p>
<p>also we know we suspect that once you</p>
<p>take the sugar out because these people</p>
<p>are completely sugar addicted and</p>
<p>carbohydrate addicted because that&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>they can afford to or they thought</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s all they could afford and so</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve eaten those foods for four</p>
<p>decades and we&rsquo;ve known and we&rsquo;ve done</p>
<p>at least ten interventions already and</p>
<p>we show the blood pressure just comes</p>
<p>shooting down just like within three</p>
<p>weeks</p>
<p>their blood pressure starts to normalize</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t need their medications</p>
<p>and they start to feel some in control</p>
<p>because these are the poorest of the</p>
<p>poor who have no control of their lives</p>
<p>and now we&rsquo;ve shown them actually we can</p>
<p>control your medical issues and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s absolutely eye-opening and it&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>rewarding</p>
<p>so my foundation is funding a major</p>
<p>study like that and then the third thing</p>
<p>we do is we have set up a nutrition</p>
<p>Network just in since May we&rsquo;re we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>teaching doctors how to prescribe low</p>
<p>carbohydrate diets and then the biology</p>
<p>and the low carbohydrate diet and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s amazing because we believe the</p>
<p>doctors are critical anyone in the</p>
<p>medical profession bit nervous physio</p>
<p>that whatever they all critical because</p>
<p>if we can eat every doctor we can</p>
<p>convert will convert ten thousand people</p>
<p>at least because he&rsquo;ll have a big</p>
<p>patience and those patients will tell</p>
<p>others and just as soon as the doctor</p>
<p>says it&rsquo;s okay then that makes a big</p>
<p>difference right what kind of are they</p>
<p>are they you seem to find that there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>interest there as they kind of slow what</p>
<p>what we&rsquo;ve had this great sign up I mean</p>
<p>we just completely we expected a hundred</p>
<p>people we got 400 people for the first</p>
<p>course so that&rsquo;s been exciting and we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>now going to really expand into a tier</p>
<p>two and then a Tier three which will it</p>
<p>be some sort of University diploma Wow</p>
<p>essence real excited it is and it&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>very very well received and we had we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>very appreciative how well people are</p>
<p>enjoying it Wow and guys just so you</p>
<p>know I&rsquo;m gonna put some links down below</p>
<p>bye professor notes foundation some of</p>
<p>his books and you need to check this guy</p>
<p>out</p>
<p>one question I had about them when</p>
<p>people start to get on a ketogenic diet</p>
<p>they lower their carbs obviously you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna lower the insulin and if they&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>been insulin resistance for a long time</p>
<p>occasionally the blood sugar is because</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve been held down by the insulin</p>
<p>tends to go up a little bit have you</p>
<p>have you seen that generally you know I</p>
<p>speak from a lot of experience if you if</p>
<p>you frankly diabetic your glucose</p>
<p>control improved dramatically so at the</p>
<p>extremes where people at glucose is</p>
<p>going up to 1518</p>
<p>20 in our units and I&rsquo;m not quite sure</p>
<p>what the American units would be but</p>
<p>within days they can get the glucose</p>
<p>down to 280 which would be normal for</p>
<p>for the other values but we talk about</p>
<p>values of five and said the remote it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>remarkable when you take a diabetic and</p>
<p>put them on the star but you&rsquo;re quite</p>
<p>right there&rsquo;s there can be a small</p>
<p>increase initially but generally that</p>
<p>will but will come let the glucose will</p>
<p>start dropping in time well this is</p>
<p>awesome I want to just thank you for</p>
<p>your time for doing this interview and I</p>
<p>think you should great insights into</p>
<p>what could be possible to improve health</p>
<p>and in the kind of contour intuitive</p>
<p>viewpoints that are kind of shattering</p>
<p>some of the myths out there the</p>
<p>mainstream so I want to thank you for</p>
<p>this interview and I hope to talk to you</p>
<p>soon with some more updates so thank you</p>
<p>very much Eric which was lovely chatting</p>
<p>to you thanks so much great</p>
