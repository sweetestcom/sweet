    <p>We think that self assembly,</p>
<p>this modular reconfigurable algorithm</p>
<p>for constructing space structures in orbit</p>
<p>is gonna give us this promise of space architecture</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s actually worth living in.</p>
<p>You see, you do believe we might one day</p>
<p>become intergalactic civilization.</p>
<p>I have a hope, yeah.</p>
<p>The following is a conversation with Ariel Ekblah,</p>
<p>Director of MIT Space Exploration Initiative.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s especially interested in autonomously</p>
<p>self assembling space architectures.</p>
<p>Basically, giant space structures</p>
<p>that can sustain human life</p>
<p>and that assemble themselves out in space</p>
<p>and then orbit Earth, Moon, Mars, and other planets.</p>
<p>This is the Lex Friedman podcast.</p>
<p>To support it, please check out our sponsors</p>
<p>in the description.</p>
<p>And now, dear friends, here&rsquo;s Ariel Ekblah.</p>
<p>When did you first fall in love with space exploration</p>
<p>and space in general?</p>
<p>My parents are both ex Air Force.</p>
<p>So my dad&rsquo;s an A10 fighter pilot</p>
<p>and my mom trained and had qualified to be a fighter pilot,</p>
<p>but it was early enough</p>
<p>that women were not allowed in combat at that time.</p>
<p>And so I grew up with these two pilots</p>
<p>and although they themselves did not become astronauts,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a really rich legacy of Air Force pilots</p>
<p>becoming astronauts and this loomed large in my childhood.</p>
<p>What does it mean to be courageous, to be an explorer,</p>
<p>to be at the vanguard of something hard and challenging?</p>
<p>And to couple with that,</p>
<p>my dad was a huge fan of science fiction.</p>
<p>And so I, as a kid, read Heinlein and Isaac Asimov,</p>
<p>all these different classics of science fiction</p>
<p>that he had introduced me to.</p>
<p>And that just started a love affair with space exploration</p>
<p>and really thinking about</p>
<p>civilization scale space exploration.</p>
<p>So did they themselves dream about going to the stars</p>
<p>as opposed to flying here in Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere,</p>
<p>just looking up?</p>
<p>Yeah, my dad always said he was absolutely convinced</p>
<p>because he was a child of the Apollo years</p>
<p>that he would get to go in his lifetime,</p>
<p>really thought it was gonna happen.</p>
<p>And so it was a challenge and sad for many people</p>
<p>when to their view on the outside,</p>
<p>space exploration slowed down for a period of time.</p>
<p>In reality, we were just catching up.</p>
<p>I think we leapt so far ahead with Apollo,</p>
<p>more than the rest of society was ready for.</p>
<p>And now we&rsquo;re coming back to this moment</p>
<p>for space exploration where we actually have an economy</p>
<p>and we have the other accoutrement that society needs</p>
<p>to be able to make space exploration more real.</p>
<p>And my dad&rsquo;s thrilled because finally,</p>
<p>not nearly, I hope not anywhere near the end of his life,</p>
<p>but as he&rsquo;s an older man,</p>
<p>he now can see still within his lifetime,</p>
<p>people really getting a chance</p>
<p>to build a sustainable lunar settlement on the moon</p>
<p>or maybe even go to Mars.</p>
<p>So settlement, civilizations and other planets,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the cool thing to dream about in the future.</p>
<p>It certainly is.</p>
<p>What was the favorite sci fi authors when you were growing up?</p>
<p>Pab√© Eszeg Asimov Foundation Trilogy.</p>
<p>This is an amazing story of Harry Seldon,</p>
<p>this foundation that he forms at different ends of the,</p>
<p>well, according to the story,</p>
<p>different ends of the universe</p>
<p>and has this interesting focus on society.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not just space exploration</p>
<p>for the sake of space exploration or novel technology,</p>
<p>which is a lot of what I work on day to day at MIT,</p>
<p>but how do you structure a society</p>
<p>across those vast expanses of distance and time?</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;d say absolutely a favorite.</p>
<p>Now though, my favorite is Neal Stephenson and Seveneves.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a book that inspired my own PhD research</p>
<p>and some ongoing work that we&rsquo;re doing with NASA now</p>
<p>for the future of swarm robotics for spacecraft.</p>
<p>We were saying offline about Neal Stephenson</p>
<p>because I just recently had a conversation with him.</p>
<p>And I said that not until I was doing the research for him</p>
<p>that I realized he also had a role to play in Blue Origin.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like sci fi actually having a role to play</p>
<p>in the design, engineering,</p>
<p>just the implementation of ideas</p>
<p>that kind of percolate up from the sci fi world</p>
<p>and actually become reality.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of a fascinating figure in that way.</p>
<p>So do you also think about him</p>
<p>beyond just his work in science fiction,</p>
<p>but his role in coming up with wild, crazy ideas</p>
<p>that actually become reality?</p>
<p>Yes, I think it&rsquo;s a great example of this cycle</p>
<p>between authors and scientists and engineers</p>
<p>that we can be inspired in one generation</p>
<p>by what authors dream up.</p>
<p>We build it, we make it a reality.</p>
<p>And then that inspires another generation</p>
<p>of really wild and crazy thought for science fiction.</p>
<p>I think Neal Stephenson does a beautiful job</p>
<p>of being what we&rsquo;d call a hard science fiction author.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s really grounded in a lot of science,</p>
<p>which makes it very compelling for me</p>
<p>as a scientist and engineer to read</p>
<p>and then be challenged to make that vision a reality.</p>
<p>The other community that Neal&rsquo;s involved with</p>
<p>and some of my other mentors are involved with</p>
<p>that we are thinking about more and more in the work</p>
<p>that we do at MIT is the Long Now Foundation.</p>
<p>And this focus on what does society need to take</p>
<p>in terms of steps at this juncture,</p>
<p>this particular inflection point in human history</p>
<p>to make sure that we&rsquo;re setting ourselves up</p>
<p>for a long and prosperous horizon,</p>
<p>for humanity&rsquo;s horizons.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of examples</p>
<p>of what the Long Now Foundation does and thinks about.</p>
<p>But when I think about this in my own work,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s what does it take to scale humanity&rsquo;s presence</p>
<p>in orbit?</p>
<p>We are seeing some additional investment</p>
<p>in commercial space habitats.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;ll no longer be just NASA</p>
<p>running the International Space Station,</p>
<p>but to really democratize access to space,</p>
<p>like Bezos wants to have millions of people living</p>
<p>and working in space,</p>
<p>you need architecture that&rsquo;s bigger and grander</p>
<p>and can actually scale.</p>
<p>That means you need to be thinking about</p>
<p>how can you construct things for long time horizons</p>
<p>that are really sustainable in orbit</p>
<p>or on a surface of a celestial body</p>
<p>that are bigger than the biggest rocket payload fairing</p>
<p>that we currently have available.</p>
<p>And that what led me to self assembly</p>
<p>and other models of in space construction.</p>
<p>Okay, every time you speak,</p>
<p>I get like a million tangent ideas.</p>
<p>You can cut me off.</p>
<p>No, no, no, no, no, no, please keep talking.</p>
<p>This is amazing.</p>
<p>I just, there&rsquo;s like a million of ideas.</p>
<p>So one sort of on the dark side, let me ask,</p>
<p>do you think about the threats to human civilization</p>
<p>that kind of motivate the scaling of the expansion</p>
<p>of humans in space and on other planets?</p>
<p>What are you worried about?</p>
<p>Nuclear war, pandemics,</p>
<p>super intelligent, artificial intelligence systems,</p>
<p>more not existential crises,</p>
<p>but ones that have significant,</p>
<p>potentially significant detrimental effects on society,</p>
<p>like climate change, those kinds of things.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s of course the fun S story</p>
<p>coming out from the darkness and hitting all earth.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s been a few movies on that.</p>
<p>Anyway, is there something that you think about</p>
<p>that threatens us in this century?</p>
<p>I mean, as an ex military family,</p>
<p>we used to talk about all of this.</p>
<p>We would say that luck favors the prepared.</p>
<p>And so growing up, we had a plan, actually a family plan</p>
<p>for what we would do in a pandemic.</p>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t think we were gonna have to put that</p>
<p>and plan into place and here we are.</p>
<p>We do, certainly among my own family and my friends</p>
<p>and then our work at MIT,</p>
<p>we do think about existential threats and risks to humanity</p>
<p>and what role does space exploration</p>
<p>and getting humans off world have to play</p>
<p>in a resilient future for humanity.</p>
<p>But what I actually find more compelling recently</p>
<p>is instead of thinking about a need to ever abandon earth</p>
<p>through a path of space exploration or space foraging</p>
<p>is to see how we can use space technology</p>
<p>to keep earth livable.</p>
<p>The obvious direct ways of doing this would be,</p>
<p>satellite technology that&rsquo;s helping us learn more</p>
<p>about climate change or emitters or CO2.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s also a future for geo engineering</p>
<p>that might be space based.</p>
<p>A lot of questions that would have to be answered</p>
<p>around that, but these are examples of pivoting our focus</p>
<p>away from maybe the Hollywood vision of,</p>
<p>oh, an asteroid&rsquo;s gonna come,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re all gonna have to escape earth</p>
<p>to let&rsquo;s use our considerable technology prowess</p>
<p>and use space technology to save earth</p>
<p>and be very much focused on how we can have</p>
<p>a worthwhile life for earth citizens.</p>
<p>Even if some of us wanna go out and further venturing.</p>
<p>Right, just the desire to explore the mysterious, yes.</p>
<p>But also it does seem that by placing us</p>
<p>in harsh conditions, the harsh conditions of space,</p>
<p>the harsh conditions of planets,</p>
<p>and the biology, the chemistry, the engineering,</p>
<p>the robotics, the materials, all of that,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just a nice way to come up with cool new things.</p>
<p>Great forcing function, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly, it&rsquo;s a forcing function like survival.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t get this right, you die.</p>
<p>So, and that you can bring back to earth</p>
<p>and it will improve, like figuring out food in space</p>
<p>will make you figure out how to eat,</p>
<p>live healthier lives here on earth.</p>
<p>So true, I mean, some of the technologies</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re directly looking at right now</p>
<p>for space habitats, it&rsquo;s hard to keep humans alive</p>
<p>in this really fragile little pocket against the vacuum</p>
<p>and all of the dangers that the space environment presents.</p>
<p>Some of the technologies we are gonna have to figure out</p>
<p>is energy efficient cooling and air conditioning,</p>
<p>air filtration, scrubbing CO2 from the air,</p>
<p>being able to have habitats that are themselves resilient</p>
<p>to extremes of space weather and radiation.</p>
<p>And some of these are direct translational opportunities</p>
<p>for areas turned by natural disasters.</p>
<p>People in California a decade ago would never have had</p>
<p>to think about having an airtight house.</p>
<p>But now with wildfires, maybe you do want something close</p>
<p>to an airtight house, how do you manage that?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of technologies</p>
<p>from the space habitation world</p>
<p>that we are hoping we can actually bring back down</p>
<p>to benefit life on earth as well</p>
<p>in these extreme environment contexts.</p>
<p>Okay, so you mentioned to go back to swarm.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So that was interesting to you,</p>
<p>first of all, in your own work,</p>
<p>but also I believe you said something</p>
<p>that was inspiring from Niel Stevenson as well.</p>
<p>So when you say swarm, are you thinking about</p>
<p>architectures or are you thinking about</p>
<p>artificial intelligence like robotics</p>
<p>or are those kind of intermixed?</p>
<p>I think the future that we&rsquo;re seeing</p>
<p>is that they&rsquo;re going to be intermixed,</p>
<p>which is really exciting.</p>
<p>So the future of space habitats</p>
<p>are one of intelligent structures,</p>
<p>maybe not all the way to Hal</p>
<p>and the 2001 Space Odyssey reference that scares people</p>
<p>about the habitat having a mind of its own.</p>
<p>But certainly we&rsquo;re building systems now</p>
<p>where the habitat has sensing technology</p>
<p>that allows it to communicate its basic functions,</p>
<p>maintaining life support for the astronauts,</p>
<p>but could also communicate in symbiosis</p>
<p>with these swarm robots</p>
<p>that would be on the outside of the spacecraft,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s in a microgravity orbiting environment</p>
<p>or on the surface.</p>
<p>And these little robots,</p>
<p>they crawl just a la Niel Stevenson in seven eves,</p>
<p>they crawl along the outside of the spacecraft</p>
<p>looking for micrometeorite punctures</p>
<p>or gas leaks or other faults and defects.</p>
<p>And right now we&rsquo;re just working on the diagnosis.</p>
<p>So can the swarm with its collective intelligence</p>
<p>act in symbiosis with the spacecraft and detect things?</p>
<p>But in the future we&rsquo;d also love</p>
<p>for these little micro robots to repair in situ</p>
<p>and really be like ants living in a tree</p>
<p>altogether connected to the spacecraft.</p>
<p>Do you envision the system to be fully distributed</p>
<p>and just like an ant colony,</p>
<p>if one of them is damaged or whatever,</p>
<p>loses control and all those kinds of things</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t affect the performance of the complete system</p>
<p>or doesn&rsquo;t need to be centralized?</p>
<p>This is more like almost like a technical question.</p>
<p>Do you think we can?</p>
<p>Good architecture question.</p>
<p>Right, from the ground up,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so scary to go fully distributed.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s also exceptionally powerful, right?</p>
<p>Robust, resilient to the harsh conditions of space.</p>
<p>What do you, if you look into the next 10, 20, 100 years,</p>
<p>starting from scratch,</p>
<p>do you think we should be doing</p>
<p>architecture wise distributed systems?</p>
<p>For space, yes, because it gives you this redundancy</p>
<p>and safety profile that&rsquo;s really critical.</p>
<p>So whether it&rsquo;s small swarm robots</p>
<p>where it doesn&rsquo;t matter if you lose a few of them,</p>
<p>to habitats that instead of having a central monolithic habitat,</p>
<p>you might actually be able to have</p>
<p>a decentralized node of a space station</p>
<p>so that you can kind of right out of Star Wars,</p>
<p>you can shut a blast door if there&rsquo;s a fire</p>
<p>or if there&rsquo;s a conflict in a certain area</p>
<p>and you can move the humans and the crew</p>
<p>into another decentralized node of the spacecraft.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s another idea out of Neal Stephenson&rsquo;s Seven Eves</p>
<p>actually where these arclets,</p>
<p>which were decentralized spacecraft that could form</p>
<p>and dock little temporary space stations with each other</p>
<p>and then separate and go off on their way</p>
<p>and have a decentralized approach to living in space.</p>
<p>So the self assembly component of that too,</p>
<p>so this is your PhD work and beyond,</p>
<p>you explored autonomously self assembling space architecture</p>
<p>for future space, tourists, habitats,</p>
<p>and space stations in orbit around Earth, Moon, and Mars.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s few things I personally find sexier</p>
<p>than autonomously self assembling space architecture.</p>
<p>In general, it doesn&rsquo;t even need to be space.</p>
<p>The idea of self assembling architectures</p>
<p>is really interesting, like building a bridge</p>
<p>or something like that through self assembling materials.</p>
<p>It feels like an incredibly efficient way to do it</p>
<p>because optimization is built in.</p>
<p>So you can build the most optimal structures</p>
<p>given dynamic, uncertain, changing conditions.</p>
<p>So maybe can you talk about your PhD work,</p>
<p>about this work, about Tesserae, what is it in general?</p>
<p>Any cool stuff, because this is super cool.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>So Tesserae is my PhD research.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s this idea that we could take tiles</p>
<p>that construct a large structure like a bucky ball.</p>
<p>Yeah, this is exactly what we&rsquo;re looking at here,</p>
<p>which is the tiles that are packed flat in a rocket.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re released to float in microgravity.</p>
<p>Magnets, pretty powerful, electropermanent magnets</p>
<p>on their edges draw them together for autonomous docking.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s no human in the loop here,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s no central agent coordinating</p>
<p>saying tile one, go to tile two.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s completely decentralized system.</p>
<p>They find each other on their own.</p>
<p>What we don&rsquo;t show in this video</p>
<p>is what happens if there&rsquo;s an error, right?</p>
<p>So what happens if they bond incorrectly?</p>
<p>The tiles have sensing, so proximity sensing,</p>
<p>magnetometer, other sensors that allow them</p>
<p>to detect a good bond versus a bad bond</p>
<p>and pulse off and self correct,</p>
<p>which anybody who works in the field of self assembly</p>
<p>will tell you that error detection and correction,</p>
<p>just like error detection in a DNA sequence</p>
<p>or protein folding is really important part of the system</p>
<p>for that robustness.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;ve done a lot of work to engineer that ability</p>
<p>for the tiles to be self determining.</p>
<p>They know whether they&rsquo;re forming the structure</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re supposed to form or not.</p>
<p>They know if they&rsquo;re in a toxic relationship</p>
<p>and they need to get out.</p>
<p>Right, right, if they need to separate, exactly, yeah.</p>
<p>All right, this is like so amazing.</p>
<p>And for people who are just listening to this,</p>
<p>yeah, there&rsquo;s, I mean, how large are these tiles?</p>
<p>So the size that we use in the lab,</p>
<p>they can really be any size</p>
<p>because we can scale them down to do testing</p>
<p>in microgravity.</p>
<p>So we sent tiles that were about three inches wide</p>
<p>to the International Space Station a couple years ago</p>
<p>to test the code, test the state machine,</p>
<p>test the algorithm of self assembly.</p>
<p>But now we&rsquo;re actually building</p>
<p>our first ever human scale tiles.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re me human size.</p>
<p>So a little smaller than maybe your average human,</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re 2.5 feet on edge length.</p>
<p>The larger scale that we would love to build in the future</p>
<p>would actually be tiles that are big enough</p>
<p>to form a bucky ball, big open spherical volume,</p>
<p>spherical approximation volume,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;d be about 10 meters in diameter.</p>
<p>So 30 feet, which is much bigger and grander</p>
<p>in terms of open space than any current module on the ISS.</p>
<p>And one of the goals of this project was to say,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the purpose of next generation space architecture?</p>
<p>Should it be something that really inspires</p>
<p>and delights people when you float into that space?</p>
<p>Can you get goosebumps in the way that you do</p>
<p>when you walk into a really stunning piece</p>
<p>of architecture on earth?</p>
<p>And so we think that self assembly,</p>
<p>this modular reconfigurable algorithm</p>
<p>for constructing space structures in orbit</p>
<p>is gonna give us this promise of space architecture</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s actually worth living in.</p>
<p>Living in, oh, I thought you also meant</p>
<p>from like outside artistic perspective,</p>
<p>when you see the whole thing is just.</p>
<p>With the aesthetics of it, absolutely.</p>
<p>You know, when you like go like into Vegas,</p>
<p>whenever you go into a city</p>
<p>and it like over the hill appears in front of you.</p>
<p>And I mean, there&rsquo;s something majestic about seeing like,</p>
<p>wow, humans created that.</p>
<p>It gives you like hope about like,</p>
<p>if these a bunch of ants were able to figure out</p>
<p>how to build skyscrapers that light up.</p>
<p>And in general, the design of these tiles</p>
<p>in the way you envision it are pretty scalable.</p>
<p>Yes, and they&rsquo;re inspired by exactly</p>
<p>what you mentioned a moment ago,</p>
<p>which is we have these patterns of self assembly on earth.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a lot of fantastic MIT research</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re building this concept on.</p>
<p>So like Daniela Ruse at CSAIL and Pebbles,</p>
<p>taking the power of magnets to create units</p>
<p>that are themselves interchangeable,</p>
<p>this notion of programmable matter.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;re interested in going really big with it</p>
<p>to build big scale space structures with programmable tiles.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s also a really fascinating,</p>
<p>you know, end of that on the other side of the spectrum,</p>
<p>which is how small can you go with matter</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s programmable and stacks and builds itself</p>
<p>and creates a bridge or something in the future.</p>
<p>What do you envision the thing would look like?</p>
<p>Like when you imagine a thing far into the future</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s, so we&rsquo;re not even thinking about</p>
<p>like small space, well, let&rsquo;s not call them small,</p>
<p>but our currently sized space stations,</p>
<p>but like something gigantic, what do you envision?</p>
<p>Is this something with symmetry</p>
<p>or is this something we can&rsquo;t even come up with yet?</p>
<p>Is there beautiful structures that you imagine in your mind?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got three candidates that I would love to build.</p>
<p>If we&rsquo;re talking about monumental space architecture,</p>
<p>one is what does a space cathedral look like?</p>
<p>It can be a secular cathedral,</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t necessarily have to be about religion,</p>
<p>but that notion of long sight lines,</p>
<p>inspiring, stunning architecture when you go in.</p>
<p>And you can imagine floating instead of, you know,</p>
<p>being on the ground and only looking up in space,</p>
<p>you could be in a central node</p>
<p>and each direction you look at,</p>
<p>all the cardinal directions are spires going off</p>
<p>in a really large and long way.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s concept number one.</p>
<p>Number two would be something more organic</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not just geometric.</p>
<p>So here, one of the ideas that we&rsquo;re working on at MIT</p>
<p>in my lab is to say, could you,</p>
<p>instead of the tesserae model, right,</p>
<p>which is self assembling a shell,</p>
<p>could you define a module that&rsquo;s a node,</p>
<p>a small node that someone can live in</p>
<p>and you self assemble a lot of those together,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re called plesiohedrons like space filling solids</p>
<p>and you dock a bunch of them together</p>
<p>and you can create a really organic structure out of that.</p>
<p>So this is the same way that muscles accrete to appear,</p>
<p>you can have these nodes that dock together</p>
<p>and one shape that I would love to form out of this</p>
<p>is something like a nautilus, a seashell,</p>
<p>that beautiful, you know, fibonacci spiral sequence</p>
<p>that you get in that shape,</p>
<p>which I think would be a stunning</p>
<p>and fabulous aggregated space station.</p>
<p>You said so many cool words, plesiohedron.</p>
<p>Yeah, plesiohedron.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a space filling.</p>
<p>Solid, the simplest thing to think of is like a cube.</p>
<p>Oh, cube. A cube, right?</p>
<p>So you can stack cubes together</p>
<p>and if you had an infinite number of cubes,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d fill all that space,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no gaps in between the cubes,</p>
<p>they stack and fill space.</p>
<p>Another plesiohedron is a truncated octahedron</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s actually one of the candidate structures</p>
<p>that we think would be great for space stations.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the truncated part?</p>
<p>Ah, so you cut off,</p>
<p>an octahedron actually has little pointy areas,</p>
<p>you truncate certain sections of it</p>
<p>and you get surfaces that are on the structure</p>
<p>that are cubes and I think hexagons,</p>
<p>I have to remind myself exactly what the faces are.</p>
<p>But overall, a truncated octahedron can be bonded</p>
<p>to other truncated octahedrons</p>
<p>and just like a cube, it fills all the gaps</p>
<p>as you build it out.</p>
<p>So you can imagine two truncated octahedrons,</p>
<p>they come together at an airlock,</p>
<p>which is what we space people call doors in space</p>
<p>and you dock them on all sides</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve basically created this decentralized network</p>
<p>of space nodes that make a big space station</p>
<p>and once you have enough of them</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re growing with enough big units,</p>
<p>you can do it in any macro shape you want.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where the Nautilus comes in,</p>
<p>is could we design an organically inspired shape</p>
<p>for a space station?</p>
<p>Can I just say how awesome it is to hear you say,</p>
<p>we space people.</p>
<p>I know you meant people that are doing research</p>
<p>on space exploration, space technology,</p>
<p>but it also made me think of a future.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s earth people and there&rsquo;s those space people.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s the Mars people.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to unite those too.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, no, for sure, for sure.</p>
<p>But like, it&rsquo;s like New Yorkers and like Texans</p>
<p>or something like that.</p>
<p>Yeah, of course you live for a time in New York</p>
<p>and then you go up to Boston</p>
<p>but for a time you&rsquo;re the space people.</p>
<p>Oh, I know those space people.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re kind of wild up there.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll see how that dynamic evolves.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s that culture, culture forms.</p>
<p>And I would love to see what kind of culture,</p>
<p>once you have sort of more and more civilians.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s a human,</p>
<p>I mean, I love psychology and sociology</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll maybe ask you about that too,</p>
<p>which is like the dynamic between humans.</p>
<p>You have to kind of start considering that</p>
<p>and you start spending more and more time up in space</p>
<p>and start sending civilians, start sending bigger</p>
<p>and bigger groups of people.</p>
<p>And then of course the beautiful and the ugly emerges</p>
<p>from the human nature that we haven&rsquo;t been able</p>
<p>to escape up to this point.</p>
<p>But when you say the plesiohedrons, these kinds of shapes,</p>
<p>are they multifunctional?</p>
<p>Like is the idea you&rsquo;d be able to,</p>
<p>humans can occupy them safely in some of them</p>
<p>and some others have some other purposes?</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>One could be sleeping quarters.</p>
<p>One could be a greenhouse or an agricultural unit.</p>
<p>One could be a storage depot.</p>
<p>Essentially all of the different rooms</p>
<p>or functions that you might need in a space station</p>
<p>could be subdivided into these nodes</p>
<p>and then stacked together.</p>
<p>And one of the promises of both Tesseray,</p>
<p>my original PhD research, which is these shells,</p>
<p>and then this follow on node concept,</p>
<p>is that right now we build space stations</p>
<p>and once they&rsquo;re built, they&rsquo;re done.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t really change them profoundly.</p>
<p>But the benefit of a modular self assembling system</p>
<p>is you can disassemble it.</p>
<p>You can completely reconfigure it.</p>
<p>So if your mission changes or the number of people</p>
<p>in space that you wanna host,</p>
<p>if you have a space conference happening</p>
<p>like South by Southwest.</p>
<p>I was thinking space party,</p>
<p>but space conference is good too.</p>
<p>Then maybe all of a sudden you want to change out</p>
<p>what were window tiles yesterday, cupola tiles,</p>
<p>and make them into a birthing port</p>
<p>so that you can welcome five new spaceships</p>
<p>to come and join you in space.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what this promise of reconfigurable space architecture</p>
<p>might allow us to explore.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been hanging out with Grimes recently</p>
<p>and I just feel like she belongs up in space.</p>
<p>This is like designed for artists essentially.</p>
<p>Like imagine, I mean, this is what South by</p>
<p>keeps introducing me to is there&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>the weird and the beautiful people and like the artists.</p>
<p>And it feels like there&rsquo;s a lot of opportunities</p>
<p>for art and design.</p>
<p>100%.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like space is a combination of arts, design,</p>
<p>and great engineering.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s safety critical with like the highest of stakes.</p>
<p>So don&rsquo;t, you can&rsquo;t mess it up.</p>
<p>And is this, is there, first of all,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re talking about tiling.</p>
<p>So Neil Stephenson is obsessed about tile.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s related to any of this,</p>
<p>but he seems to be obsessed with like,</p>
<p>how do you tile a space?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like a mathematical, geometric notion.</p>
<p>Like the tessellation.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s, I mean, it&rsquo;s a beautiful idea for architecture</p>
<p>that you can self assemble these different shapes</p>
<p>and you can have probably some centralized guidance</p>
<p>of the kind of thing you want to build.</p>
<p>But they also kind of figure stuff out themselves</p>
<p>in terms of the low level details,</p>
<p>in terms of the figuring out when the,</p>
<p>when everything fits just right for the OCD people,</p>
<p>like what&rsquo;s that subreddit?</p>
<p>Pleasantly, it&rsquo;s like really fun.</p>
<p>Everything, they have like videos of everything</p>
<p>is just pleasant when everything just fits perfectly.</p>
<p>Very pleasing.</p>
<p>All the tolerances come together well, yeah.</p>
<p>So they figure that out on themselves</p>
<p>and the local robotics problem.</p>
<p>But by the way, what&rsquo;s the Pebbles Project?</p>
<p>The Pebbles Project are little cubes</p>
<p>that have EPMs in them, electropermanent magnets,</p>
<p>and they can self disassemble.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;ll turn off.</p>
<p>And so you&rsquo;ll have this little structure</p>
<p>that all of a sudden can flip the little pebbles over</p>
<p>and essentially just disaggregate.</p>
<p>They have to make some pleasing sounds.</p>
<p>Yes, they do.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s gonna, so I&rsquo;m supposed to talk to Danielle,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;ll probably spend an hour</p>
<p>just discussing the sounds on the pebbles.</p>
<p>Okay, what were we talking about?</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s, because you mentioned two, I think.</p>
<p>Right, my third one.</p>
<p>Yeah, is there a third one?</p>
<p>My third one is The Ringworld,</p>
<p>just because every science fiction book ever</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s worth anything has A Ringworld in it.</p>
<p>Is it like a donut?</p>
<p>A donut, yeah, it&rsquo;s a really big torus</p>
<p>that could encircle a planet</p>
<p>or encircle another celestial body,</p>
<p>maybe an asteroid or a small moon.</p>
<p>And the promise here is just the beauty</p>
<p>of being able to have that geometry in orbit</p>
<p>and all that surface area for solar panels and docking</p>
<p>and essentially just all of what that enables</p>
<p>to have a ring world at that scale in orbit.</p>
<p>By the way, for the viewers, we&rsquo;re looking at Figure 11.</p>
<p>What paper is this from?</p>
<p>This is a hexagonal tiling</p>
<p>of a torus generated in Mathematica</p>
<p>referencing code and approach from two citations.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re looking at a tiled donut, and I&rsquo;m now hungry.</p>
<p>So this is the, is this from your thesis or no?</p>
<p>This is probably, I mean, this is in my thesis.</p>
<p>This looks like it was one of my earlier papers.</p>
<p>This was an approach to say, great,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve come up with this tessellation approach</p>
<p>for a buckyball, and we picked the buckyball</p>
<p>because it is the most efficient surface area</p>
<p>to volume shape and what&rsquo;s expensive in space,</p>
<p>the surface area shipping up all that material.</p>
<p>So we wanted something that would maximize the volume.</p>
<p>But if we think about ring worlds and other shapes,</p>
<p>we wanted to look at how do you tile a torus?</p>
<p>And this is one example with hexagons</p>
<p>to be able to say, could we take this same tesserae approach</p>
<p>of self assembling tiles and create other geometries?</p>
<p>This is so freaking cool.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s awesome.</p>
<p>So you mentioned microgravity, and I saw,</p>
<p>I believe that there&rsquo;s a picture</p>
<p>of you floating in microgravity.</p>
<p>When did you get to experience that?</p>
<p>What was that like?</p>
<p>Ah, so I&rsquo;ve flown nine times</p>
<p>on the affectionately known as the Vomit Comet.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the parabolic flight, and essentially,</p>
<p>it does what you&rsquo;d want a plane never to do.</p>
<p>It pitches really steeply upwards at 45 degrees.</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s a picture of you.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, that&rsquo;s tesserae.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s super early in my PhD,</p>
<p>some of just the passive tiles</p>
<p>before we even put electronics in.</p>
<p>We were just testing the magnet polarity</p>
<p>and the, essentially, is it an energy favorable structure</p>
<p>to self assemble on its own?</p>
<p>So we tweaked a lot of things between.</p>
<p>Are we looking at a couple of them?</p>
<p>Yeah, you&rsquo;re looking at a bunch of them there.</p>
<p>Oh, oh, I see.</p>
<p>Almost 32 of them, yeah.</p>
<p>Cool.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re clumping, they&rsquo;re clumping, yeah.</p>
<p>Can you comment on what&rsquo;s the difference</p>
<p>between microgravity and zero gravity?</p>
<p>Yes, so there is, is that an important difference?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an important difference.</p>
<p>There is no zero gravity.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no nothing, there&rsquo;s, in the universe,</p>
<p>there is no such thing as zero gravity.</p>
<p>So Newton&rsquo;s law of gravity tells us</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s always gravity attraction</p>
<p>between any two objects.</p>
<p>So zero G is a shorthand that some of us fall into using,</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s a little easier to communicate to the public.</p>
<p>The accurate term is microgravity,</p>
<p>where you are essentially floating, you&rsquo;re weightless,</p>
<p>but generally in free fall.</p>
<p>So on the parabolic flights, the vomit comet,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re in free fall at the end of the parabola.</p>
<p>And in orbit around the Earth when you&rsquo;re floating,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re also in free fall.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s microgravity.</p>
<p>So affectionately called vomit comet,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s a reason why it&rsquo;s called affectionately.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s it like?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your first time?</p>
<p>So both philosophically, spiritually, and biologically,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s it like?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s profound.</p>
<p>It is unlike anything else you will experience on Earth</p>
<p>because it is this true feeling of weightlessness</p>
<p>with no drag.</p>
<p>So the closest experience you can think of</p>
<p>would be floating in a pool,</p>
<p>but you move slowly when you float in a pool</p>
<p>and your motion is restricted.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re floating, it&rsquo;s just you and your body flying,</p>
<p>like in a dream.</p>
<p>It takes the littlest amount of energy,</p>
<p>like a finger tap against the wall of the plane</p>
<p>to shoot all the way across the fuselage.</p>
<p>And you can move at full speed.</p>
<p>You can move your arms.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>So your muscles work.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no resistance.</p>
<p>They actually tell you to make a memory</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re on the plane</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s such a fleeting experience for your body</p>
<p>that even a few days later,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve already forgotten exactly what it felt like.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so foreign to the human experience.</p>
<p>They kind of suggest that you explicitly try</p>
<p>to really form this into a memory</p>
<p>and then you can do the replay.</p>
<p>Is that for training?</p>
<p>Cognitively freeze it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Cognitively.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Save.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>When we have Neuralink, we can replay that memory.</p>
<p>So in terms of how much stress it has on your body,</p>
<p>is it biologically stressful?</p>
<p>You do feel a 2G pullout, right?</p>
<p>So the cost of getting those micro G parabolas</p>
<p>is you then have a 2G pullout and that&rsquo;s hard.</p>
<p>You have to train for it.</p>
<p>If you move your neck too quickly in that 2G pullout,</p>
<p>you can strain muscles.</p>
<p>But I wouldn&rsquo;t say that it&rsquo;s actually</p>
<p>a profound tough thing on the body.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really just an incredibly novel experience.</p>
<p>And when you&rsquo;re in orbit</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re not having to go through the ups and downs</p>
<p>of the parabolic plane,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a real grace and elegance.</p>
<p>And you see the astronauts learn to operate</p>
<p>in this completely new environment.</p>
<p>What are some interesting differences</p>
<p>between the parabolic plane</p>
<p>and when you&rsquo;re actually going up into orbit?</p>
<p>Is it that with orbit you can look out</p>
<p>and see that blue little planet of ours?</p>
<p>You can see the blue marble, the stunning overview effect,</p>
<p>which is something I hope to see one day.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s also really different is if you&rsquo;re in orbit</p>
<p>for any significant period of time,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s gonna be a lot more physiological changes</p>
<p>to your body than if you just did an afternoon flight</p>
<p>on the Vomit Comet.</p>
<p>Everything from your bones, your muscles,</p>
<p>your eyeballs change shape.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of different things that happen</p>
<p>for long duration space flight.</p>
<p>And we still have to, as scientists,</p>
<p>we still have to solve a lot of these interesting challenges</p>
<p>to be able to keep humans thriving in microgravity</p>
<p>or deep duration space missions.</p>
<p>Deep duration space missions.</p>
<p>Okay, let&rsquo;s talk about this.</p>
<p>I was just gonna ask a bunch of dumb questions.</p>
<p>So approximately how long does it take to travel to Mars?</p>
<p>Asking for a friend.</p>
<p>Asking for a friend, as we all do.</p>
<p>About three years for a round trip.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not that it actually takes that long.</p>
<p>Why the round trip, is that?</p>
<p>Well, you&rsquo;re just asking about the one way trip.</p>
<p>Got it, got it, got it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s okay, cool.</p>
<p>So for just like literally flying to Mars in a round,</p>
<p>it takes three years.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some interstitial time there</p>
<p>because you really can only go between Earth and Mars</p>
<p>at certain points in their orbits</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s favorable to make that journey.</p>
<p>And so part of that three years</p>
<p>is you take the journey to Mars,</p>
<p>a few months, six to nine months.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re there for a period of time</p>
<p>until the orbits find a favorable alignment again.</p>
<p>And then you come back another six to nine months.</p>
<p>So one way travel, six to nine months.</p>
<p>They hang out there on vacation and come back.</p>
<p>Forced vacation.</p>
<p>You come back.</p>
<p>Well, me who loves working all the time,</p>
<p>all vacation is forced vacation.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>So okay, so that gives us a sense of duration.</p>
<p>And we can maybe also talk about longer</p>
<p>and longer and longer duration as well.</p>
<p>What are the hardest aspects of living in space</p>
<p>for many days, for let&rsquo;s say 100 days, 200 days?</p>
<p>Maybe there&rsquo;s a threshold when it gets really tough.</p>
<p>What are some stupid little things or big things</p>
<p>that are very difficult for human beings to go through?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one big thing and one little thing.</p>
<p>And there are these two classic problems</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re trying to solve in the space industry.</p>
<p>One is radiation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not as much of a problem for us right now</p>
<p>on the International Space Station</p>
<p>because we&rsquo;re still protected</p>
<p>by part of Earth&rsquo;s magnetosphere.</p>
<p>But as soon as you get farther out into space</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t have that protection</p>
<p>once you leave the Van Allen belt area of the Earth</p>
<p>and the cocoon around the Earth,</p>
<p>we have really serious concerns about radiation</p>
<p>and the effect on human health longterm.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the big one.</p>
<p>The small one, and I say it&rsquo;s small</p>
<p>because it seems mundane,</p>
<p>but it actually is really big in its own way,</p>
<p>is mental health and how to keep people happy and balanced.</p>
<p>And you were alluding to some of the psychological</p>
<p>challenges of having humans together on missions</p>
<p>and especially as we try to scale the number of humans</p>
<p>in orbit or in space.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s another big challenge is how to keep people happy</p>
<p>and balanced and cooperating.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not an issue on Earth at all.</p>
<p>At all.</p>
<p>Okay, so we&rsquo;ll talk about each of those</p>
<p>in a bit more detail,</p>
<p>but let me continue on the chain of dumb questions.</p>
<p>What about food?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s a good source for food in space?</p>
<p>And what are some sort of standard go to meals, menus?</p>
<p>Right now your go to menu is gonna be mostly freeze dried.</p>
<p>Every so often NASA will arrange for a fun stunt</p>
<p>or fresh food to get up to station.</p>
<p>So they did bake DoubleTree cookies with Hilton</p>
<p>a couple of years ago, as I recall,</p>
<p>I think sometime before the pandemic.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s work actually in our lab at MIT,</p>
<p>Maggie Koblans, one of my staff researchers</p>
<p>is looking at the future of fermentation.</p>
<p>Everybody loves beer, right?</p>
<p>Beer and wine and kimchi and miso,</p>
<p>these foods that have just been really important</p>
<p>to human cultures for eons because we love the umami</p>
<p>and the better flavor in them.</p>
<p>But it turns out they also have a good shelf life</p>
<p>if done properly.</p>
<p>And they also have a additional health benefit</p>
<p>for the microbiome, for probiotics and prebiotics.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re trying to work with NASA and convince them</p>
<p>to be more open minded to fermented food</p>
<p>for long duration deep space missions.</p>
<p>That we think is one of the future elements</p>
<p>in addition to in situ growing your own food.</p>
<p>Okay, this is essential for the space party</p>
<p>is the space beer.</p>
<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s the fermented product, yes.</p>
<p>Okay, cool.</p>
<p>In terms of water, what&rsquo;s a good source of drinkable water?</p>
<p>Like where do you get water?</p>
<p>Do you have to always bring it on board with you?</p>
<p>And is there a compressed efficient way of storing it?</p>
<p>So to steal a line from Charlie Bolden,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s the former administrator of NASA,</p>
<p>this morning&rsquo;s fresh water is yesterday&rsquo;s coffee.</p>
<p>So if you think about what that means,</p>
<p>you drank the coffee yesterday.</p>
<p>Right, as it travels, it goes fully through the body.</p>
<p>Fully through the body as the recycling system.</p>
<p>And then you drink what you peed out</p>
<p>as clarified, refined fresh water the next day.</p>
<p>That is one source of water.</p>
<p>Another source of water in the near neighborhood</p>
<p>of our solar system would be on the moon.</p>
<p>So water ice deposits, there&rsquo;s also water on Mars.</p>
<p>This is one of the big things that&rsquo;s bringing people</p>
<p>to want to develop infrastructure on the moon</p>
<p>is once you&rsquo;ve gotten out of the gravity well of Earth,</p>
<p>if you can find water on the moon and refine it,</p>
<p>you can either make it into propellant</p>
<p>or drinkable water for humans.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s really valuable as a potential gateway</p>
<p>out into the rest of the solar system</p>
<p>to be able to get propellant</p>
<p>without always having to ship it up from Earth.</p>
<p>So how much water is there on Mars?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a great question.</p>
<p>I do not know.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know this yet, right?</p>
<p>I know there&rsquo;s water at the caps.</p>
<p>I suspect NASA from all of the satellite studies</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;ve done at Mars have a decent idea</p>
<p>of what the water deposits look like,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t know to what degree</p>
<p>they have characterized those.</p>
<p>I really hope there&rsquo;s life or traces</p>
<p>of previous life on Mars.</p>
<p>This is a special spot in my heart</p>
<p>because I got to work on SHERLOC,</p>
<p>which is the astrobiology experiment</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s on Mars right now,</p>
<p>searching for what they would say</p>
<p>in a very cautious way is signs of past habitability.</p>
<p>They wanna be careful not to get people overly excited</p>
<p>and say we&rsquo;re searching for signs of life.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re searching to see if there would have been organics</p>
<p>on the surface of Mars or water in certain areas</p>
<p>that would have allowed for life to flourish.</p>
<p>And I really love this prospect.</p>
<p>I do think within our lifetimes</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll get a better answer about finding life</p>
<p>in our solar system if it&rsquo;s there.</p>
<p>If not on Mars, maybe Europa, one of the icy worlds.</p>
<p>So you like astrobiology.</p>
<p>I do.</p>
<p>This is part of the, it&rsquo;s not just about human biology.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also other extraterrestrial alien biology.</p>
<p>Search for life in the universe.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Does that scare you or excite you?</p>
<p>It excites me, profoundly excites me.</p>
<p>That there&rsquo;s other alien civilizations</p>
<p>potentially very different than our own?</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s gotta be some humility there.</p>
<p>And certainly from science fiction</p>
<p>we have plenty of reasons to fear that outcome as well.</p>
<p>But I do think as a scientist</p>
<p>it would be profoundly exciting if we were to find life</p>
<p>especially in the near neighborhood of our solar system.</p>
<p>Right now we would expect it to be most likely microbial life</p>
<p>but we have a real serious challenge in astrobiology</p>
<p>which is it may not even be carbon based life.</p>
<p>And all of our detectors,</p>
<p>we only know to look for DNA or RNA.</p>
<p>How would you even build a detector</p>
<p>to look for silicon based life</p>
<p>or different molecules than what we know</p>
<p>to be the fundamental molecules for life?</p>
<p>And then you mentioned offline Sarah Walker.</p>
<p>I mean she, her, the question that she&rsquo;s obsessed with</p>
<p>is even just defining life.</p>
<p>What is life?</p>
<p>To look outside the carbon base.</p>
<p>I mean to look outside of basically anything</p>
<p>we can even imagine chemically.</p>
<p>To look outside of any kind of notions</p>
<p>that we think of as biology.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s really weird.</p>
<p>So you now get into this land of like complexity</p>
<p>of a measuring of like how many assembly steps</p>
<p>it takes to build that thing.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And maybe dynamic movement or some maintenance</p>
<p>of some kind of membrane structures.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t even know like which properties life should have.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Whether it should be able to reproduce</p>
<p>and all those kinds of things or pass information,</p>
<p>genetic type of information.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s so humbling.</p>
<p>I mean I tend to believe that there could be</p>
<p>something like alien life here on Earth</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re just too human, biology obsessed</p>
<p>to even recognize it.</p>
<p>The shadow biosphere, I remember you and Sarah</p>
<p>were talking about.</p>
<p>I mean that&rsquo;s like, speaking of beer,</p>
<p>I mean that&rsquo;s something I wanted to make sure</p>
<p>in all of science to shake ourselves out of like,</p>
<p>remind ourselves constantly how little we know.</p>
<p>Because it might be right in front of our nose.</p>
<p>Like I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if like trees</p>
<p>are like orders of magnitude more intelligent than humans.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just operating at a much slower scale</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re like talking shit about us the whole time.</p>
<p>Like about silly humans that take everything seriously</p>
<p>and we start all kinds of nuclear wars</p>
<p>and we quarrel and we tweet about it and then,</p>
<p>but the trees are always there just watching us silly humans.</p>
<p>Like the Ents in Lord of the Rings.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>So I mean, I don&rsquo;t know, I mean, obviously I&rsquo;m joking</p>
<p>on that one, but there could be stuff like that.</p>
<p>Well, let me ask you the Drake equation,</p>
<p>the big question, how many, like obviously nobody knows,</p>
<p>but what&rsquo;s your gut, what&rsquo;s your hope as a scientist,</p>
<p>as a human, how many alien civilizations are out there?</p>
<p>As a ex physicist, I&rsquo;m now much more</p>
<p>on the aerospace engineering side for space architecture,</p>
<p>but as an ex physicist, I hope it is prolific.</p>
<p>I think the challenge is if it&rsquo;s as prolific</p>
<p>as we would hope, if there are many, many, many</p>
<p>civilizations, then the question is, where are they?</p>
<p>Why haven&rsquo;t we heard from them?</p>
<p>And the Fermi paradox, is there some great filter</p>
<p>that life only gets to some level of sophistication</p>
<p>and then kills itself off through war or through famine</p>
<p>or through different challenges that filter</p>
<p>that society out of existence?</p>
<p>And it would be an interesting question to try</p>
<p>to understand if the universe was teeming with life,</p>
<p>why haven&rsquo;t we found it or heard from it yet,</p>
<p>to our knowledge?</p>
<p>Yeah, I personally believe that it&rsquo;s teeming with life,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re right, I think that&rsquo;s a really useful,</p>
<p>productive engineering scientific question</p>
<p>of what kind of great filter can just be destroying</p>
<p>all of that life or preventing it from just constantly</p>
<p>talking to us, silly descendants of apes.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a really nice question, like what are the ways</p>
<p>civilizations can destroy themselves?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s too many, sadly.</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ve come up with most of them yet.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s also probably true.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the thing, it&rsquo;s, I mean, and if you look</p>
<p>at nuclear war, some of it is physics,</p>
<p>but some of it is game theory, it&rsquo;s human nature,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s how societies built themselves, how they interact,</p>
<p>how we create and resolve conflict,</p>
<p>and it gets back to the human question</p>
<p>on when you&rsquo;re doing long term space travel,</p>
<p>how do you maintain this dynamical system</p>
<p>of flawed, irrational humans such that it persists</p>
<p>throughout time, and not just maintain the biological body,</p>
<p>but get people from not murdering each other,</p>
<p>like like each other sufficiently to where you kinda</p>
<p>fit well, but I think if songs or poetry or books</p>
<p>taught me anything, if you like each other a little too much,</p>
<p>I mean, the problems arise, because then there&rsquo;s always</p>
<p>a third person who also likes, and then there&rsquo;s the drama,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, I can&rsquo;t believe you did that last night,</p>
<p>whatever, so, and then there&rsquo;s beer.</p>
<p>Gets complicated quickly. Gets complicated quickly.</p>
<p>Okay, anyway, back to the dumb questions,</p>
<p>because you answered this, there&rsquo;s an interview</p>
<p>where you answer a bunch of cool little questions</p>
<p>from young students and so on, about like space.</p>
<p>One of them was playing music in space.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And you mentioned something about what kind of instruments</p>
<p>you could use to play music in space.</p>
<p>Could you mention about like the Spotify work in space,</p>
<p>and if I wanted to do a live performance,</p>
<p>what kind of instruments would I need?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, you referenced culture before,</p>
<p>and I think this is one of the most exciting things</p>
<p>that we have at our fingertips, which is to define</p>
<p>a new culture for space exploration.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t just have to import cultural artifacts from Earth</p>
<p>to make life worth living in space,</p>
<p>and this musical instrument that you referenced</p>
<p>was a design of an object that could only be performed</p>
<p>in microgravity.</p>
<p>Oh, cool.</p>
<p>So it doesn&rsquo;t sound the same way when it&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a percussive instrument when it&rsquo;s rattled</p>
<p>or moved in a gravity environment, it is unique.</p>
<p>Can we look it up?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called the Telematron.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s created by.</p>
<p>Of course it&rsquo;s called the Telematron.</p>
<p>Telematron.</p>
<p>That is so awesome.</p>
<p>Created by Sands Fish and Nicole Boulier,</p>
<p>two amazing graduate students and staff researchers</p>
<p>on my team.</p>
<p>What does it look like?</p>
<p>It looks steampunk, actually.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s awesome.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s a pretty cool design.</p>
<p>It looks like it&rsquo;s a geometric solid</p>
<p>that has these interesting artifacts on the inside,</p>
<p>and it has a lot of sensors, actually,</p>
<p>additionally on the inside,</p>
<p>like IMU&rsquo;s inertial measurement sensors</p>
<p>that allow it to detect when it&rsquo;s floating</p>
<p>and when it&rsquo;s not floating,</p>
<p>and provides this really kind of ethereal,</p>
<p>they later sonify it.</p>
<p>So they use electronic music to turn it into a symphony</p>
<p>or turn it into a piece.</p>
<p>And yeah, this is the object, the Telematron.</p>
<p>How does the human interact with it?</p>
<p>By tossing it.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s an interactive musical instrument.</p>
<p>It actually requires another partner.</p>
<p>So the idea was that it&rsquo;s something like a dance</p>
<p>or just like something like a choreography in space.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, you also talked about sports,</p>
<p>and like ball sports, like playing soccer.</p>
<p>So you mentioned that,</p>
<p>so your muscles can move at full speed,</p>
<p>and then if you push off the wall lightly,</p>
<p>you fly across, zoom across.</p>
<p>So how does the physics of that work?</p>
<p>Can you still play soccer, for example, in space?</p>
<p>You can, but one of the most intuitive things</p>
<p>that we all learn as babies, right,</p>
<p>is whenever you throw something,</p>
<p>if I was gonna toss something to you,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d toss it up,</p>
<p>because I know that it has to compensate</p>
<p>for the fact that that Keplerian arc is gonna draw it down,</p>
<p>the equations of motion are gonna draw it down.</p>
<p>I would, in space,</p>
<p>I would just shoot something directly towards you,</p>
<p>so like straight in line of sight.</p>
<p>And so that would be very different</p>
<p>for any type of ball sport,</p>
<p>is to retrain your human mind</p>
<p>to have that as your intuitive arc of motion</p>
<p>or lack of arc.</p>
<p>From your experience,</p>
<p>from understanding how astronauts</p>
<p>get adjusted to this stuff,</p>
<p>how long does it take to adjust to the physics</p>
<p>of this world, this other world?</p>
<p>So even after one or two parabolic flights,</p>
<p>you can gain a certain facility</p>
<p>with moving in that environment.</p>
<p>I think most astronauts would say</p>
<p>maybe several days on station</p>
<p>or a week on station,</p>
<p>and their brain flips.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s amazing the plasticity of the human brain</p>
<p>and how quickly they are able to adapt.</p>
<p>And so pretty quickly,</p>
<p>they become creatures of this new environment.</p>
<p>Okay, so that&rsquo;s cool.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s creating a little bit of an experience.</p>
<p>What about if you go for more than 100 days</p>
<p>for one year, for two years, for three years?</p>
<p>What challenges start to emerge in that case?</p>
<p>So Scott Kelly wrote this amazing book</p>
<p>after he spent a year in space,</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s a twin.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s absolutely fantastic</p>
<p>that NASA got to do a twin study.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s perfect.</p>
<p>So he wrote a lot about his experience</p>
<p>on the health side of what changed,</p>
<p>things like bone density, muscle atrophy,</p>
<p>eyesight changing</p>
<p>because the shape of your eyeball changes,</p>
<p>which changes your lens,</p>
<p>which changes how you see.</p>
<p>If we&rsquo;re then thinking about the challenges</p>
<p>between a year and three years,</p>
<p>especially if we&rsquo;re doing that three year trip to Mars</p>
<p>for your friend who asked earlier,</p>
<p>then you have to think about nutrition.</p>
<p>And so how are you keeping</p>
<p>all of these different needs for your body alive?</p>
<p>How are you protecting astronauts against radiation?</p>
<p>Either having some type of a shell on the spacecraft,</p>
<p>which is expensive because it&rsquo;s heavy.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s something like lead,</p>
<p>a really effective radiation shell,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna be a lot of mass.</p>
<p>Or is there a pill that could be taken</p>
<p>to try to make you less in danger</p>
<p>of some of the radiation effects?</p>
<p>A lot of this has not yet been answered,</p>
<p>but radiation is a really significant challenge</p>
<p>for that three year journey.</p>
<p>And what are the negative effects of radiation</p>
<p>on the human body out in space?</p>
<p>A higher likelihood to develop cancer at a younger age.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;d probably be able to get there and get back,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;d find yourself in the same way</p>
<p>of if you were exposed to significant radiation on Earth,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d find significant bad health effects as you age.</p>
<p>What do you think about like decades?</p>
<p>Do you think about decades?</p>
<p>Or is this like an entire?</p>
<p>I think about centuries for MySpace.</p>
<p>But yeah, for decades,</p>
<p>I think as soon as we get past the three year mark,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll absolutely want,</p>
<p>somewhere between three years and a decade,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll want artificial gravity.</p>
<p>And we know how to do that, actually.</p>
<p>The engineering questions still need to be tweaked</p>
<p>for how we&rsquo;d really implement it,</p>
<p>but the science is there to know</p>
<p>how we would spin habitats in orbit and generate that force.</p>
<p>So even if the entire habitat&rsquo;s not spinning,</p>
<p>you at least have a treadmill part of the space station</p>
<p>that is spinning,</p>
<p>and you can spend some fraction of your day</p>
<p>in a near to 1G environment and keep your body healthy.</p>
<p>Wait, literally from just spinning?</p>
<p>From spinning, yes, centripetal force.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fascinating. So you generate this force.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve ever been in those carnival rides,</p>
<p>the gravitrons that spin you up around the side,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the concept.</p>
<p>And this is actually one of the reasons</p>
<p>why we are spinning out a new company</p>
<p>from my MIT lab. Spinning out, ha.</p>
<p>Spinning out, ha.</p>
<p>That was accidental, but well noted space pun.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like impossible to avoid. Dad jokes, all right.</p>
<p>But yeah, we&rsquo;re spinning out a new company</p>
<p>to look at next generation space architecture,</p>
<p>and how do we actually scale humanity&rsquo;s access to space?</p>
<p>And one of the areas that we wanna look at</p>
<p>is artificial gravity.</p>
<p>Is there a name yet?</p>
<p>Yep, there&rsquo;s a name. We are brand new.</p>
<p>We are just exiting stealth mode.</p>
<p>So your podcast listeners will literally be among</p>
<p>some of the first to hear about it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called Aurelia Institute.</p>
<p>Aurelia is an old English word for chrysalis.</p>
<p>And the idea with this is that we, humanity collectively,</p>
<p>are at this next stage of our metamorphosis,</p>
<p>like a chrysalis, into a spacefaring species.</p>
<p>And so we felt that this was a good time,</p>
<p>a necessary time, to think about</p>
<p>next generation space architecture,</p>
<p>but also Starfleet Academy,</p>
<p>if you know that reference from Star Trek.</p>
<p>Yes, so let me ask a silly sounding, ridiculous sounding,</p>
<p>but probably extremely important question.</p>
<p>Sex and space, including intercourse, conception,</p>
<p>procreation, birth, like being a parent,</p>
<p>like raising the baby.</p>
<p>So basically from birth, well, from the before birth part,</p>
<p>like the birds and the bees and stuff,</p>
<p>and then the whole thing.</p>
<p>How complicated is that?</p>
<p>I remember looking at the, thank you.</p>
<p>I remember looking at this exact Wikipedia page actually,</p>
<p>and I remember being, the Wikipedia page is sex and space,</p>
<p>and fascinating how difficult of an engineering problem</p>
<p>the whole thing is.</p>
<p>Is that something you think about too,</p>
<p>how to have generations of humans?</p>
<p>Self, self replicating organizations.</p>
<p>Yeah, societies essentially.</p>
<p>I mean, I guess with micro,</p>
<p>like if you solve the gravity problem,</p>
<p>you solve a lot of these problems.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the hope, yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the central challenge of microgravity</p>
<p>to human reproduction.</p>
<p>But we do host a workshop every year at Beyond the Cradle,</p>
<p>which is the space event that we run at MIT.</p>
<p>And we always do one on pregnancy in space,</p>
<p>or motherhood, or raising children in space,</p>
<p>because there are huge questions.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;ve been a few mammal studies</p>
<p>that have looked at reproduction in space,</p>
<p>but there are still really major questions</p>
<p>about how does it work?</p>
<p>How does the fetus evolve in microgravity</p>
<p>if you were pregnant in space?</p>
<p>And I think the near term answer is just gonna be,</p>
<p>we need to be able to give humans a 1G environment</p>
<p>for that phase of our development.</p>
<p>Yeah, so there&rsquo;s some studies on mice in microgravity.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s interesting, I think the mice,</p>
<p>like one of them, the mice weren&rsquo;t able to walk,</p>
<p>or their understanding of physics, I guess,</p>
<p>is off or something like that.</p>
<p>Yeah, the mental model when you&rsquo;re really young</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re kind of getting your mental model of physics,</p>
<p>we do think that that would change kids abilities</p>
<p>to if they were born in microgravity,</p>
<p>their ability to have that intuition</p>
<p>around an Earth based 1G environment might be missing,</p>
<p>because a lot of that is really crystallized</p>
<p>in early development, early childhood development.</p>
<p>So that makes sense that they would see that in mice, yeah.</p>
<p>So what about life when we choose to park our vehicles</p>
<p>on another planet, on the moon, but let&rsquo;s go to Mars?</p>
<p>First of all, is that excite you, humans going to Mars,</p>
<p>like stepping foot on Mars?</p>
<p>And when do you think it&rsquo;ll happen?</p>
<p>It does excite me.</p>
<p>I think visionaries like Elon are working</p>
<p>to make that happen in terms of building the road to space.</p>
<p>We are really excited about building out</p>
<p>the human lived experience of space once you get there.</p>
<p>So how are you going to grow your food?</p>
<p>What is your habitat going to look like?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s profoundly exciting,</p>
<p>but I do think that there&rsquo;s a little bit</p>
<p>of a misunderstanding of Mars anywhere in the near future</p>
<p>being anything like a replacement for Earth.</p>
<p>So it is good for humanity to have these other pockets</p>
<p>of our civilization that can expand out beyond Earth,</p>
<p>but Mars is not in its current state,</p>
<p>a good home for humanity.</p>
<p>Too many perchlorates in the soil,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t use that soil to grow crops.</p>
<p>Atmosphere is too thin, certainly can&rsquo;t breathe it,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also just really thin compared to our atmosphere.</p>
<p>A lot of different challenges that would have</p>
<p>to be fundamentally changed on that planet</p>
<p>to make it a good home for a large human civilization.</p>
<p>How does a large civilization of humans get built on Mars?</p>
<p>And where do you think it starts being difficult?</p>
<p>So can you have a small base of like 10 people,</p>
<p>essentially, kind of like the International Space Station</p>
<p>kind of situation, and then can you get it to 100,</p>
<p>to 1,000, to a million?</p>
<p>Are there some interesting challenges there</p>
<p>that worry you, saying that Mars is just not a good backup</p>
<p>at this time for Earth?</p>
<p>I think small outposts, absolutely, like McMurdo, right?</p>
<p>So we have these models of really extreme environments</p>
<p>on Earth in Antarctica, for example,</p>
<p>where humans have been able to go</p>
<p>and make a sustainable settlement.</p>
<p>McMurdo style life on Mars, probably feasible in the 2030s.</p>
<p>So we want to send the first human missions to Mars</p>
<p>and maybe as early as the end of this decade,</p>
<p>more likely early 2030s.</p>
<p>Moving anywhere beyond that in terms of a place</p>
<p>where like an entire human life would be lived,</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s not just you go for a three month deployment</p>
<p>and you come back, that is actually the big challenge line,</p>
<p>is just saying, is there enough technological sophistication</p>
<p>that can be brought that far out into space?</p>
<p>If you imagine your electronics break,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no RadioShack, this dates me a little bit</p>
<p>that my mind jumps to RadioShack,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s no supply chains on Mars</p>
<p>that can supply the level of technological sophistication</p>
<p>for all the products that we rely on, on day to day life.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;d be going back to actually a very simple existence,</p>
<p>more like pioneer life out West,</p>
<p>in the story of the US, for example.</p>
<p>And I think that the future of larger scale gatherings</p>
<p>of humans in orbit, or sorry, in space,</p>
<p>is actually gonna be in microgravity,</p>
<p>floating space cities, not so much trying</p>
<p>to establish settlements on the surface.</p>
<p>So you think sort of a significant engineering investment</p>
<p>in terms of our efforts and money</p>
<p>should be on large spaceships,</p>
<p>that perhaps are doing this kind of self assembly,</p>
<p>all these kinds of things, and doing it in orbit,</p>
<p>maybe building a giant donut around the planet over time.</p>
<p>Yeah, that is the goal.</p>
<p>And I think the current political climate</p>
<p>is such that you can&rsquo;t get the trillion dollar investment</p>
<p>to start from scratch and build the sci fi megastructure.</p>
<p>But if you can build it in fits and starts,</p>
<p>in little different pieces,</p>
<p>which is another advantage of self assembly,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s much more like how nature works.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s biomimicry inspired way for humanity</p>
<p>to scale out in space.</p>
<p>And whether it&rsquo;s out in space or on Mars,</p>
<p>the idea that sort of two people fall in love,</p>
<p>they have sex, a child is born,</p>
<p>and then that couple has to teach that child</p>
<p>that they came from Earth.</p>
<p>I just love the idea that somebody is born on Mars</p>
<p>or out in space, and you have to be like,</p>
<p>this is not actually like the original home.</p>
<p>Just them looking at Earth and being like,</p>
<p>this is where we came from.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, that&rsquo;s really inspiring to me.</p>
<p>And the child being really confused</p>
<p>and then wanting to go back to TikTok,</p>
<p>or whatever they do.</p>
<p>Whatever they do in that area.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s great sci fi, right,</p>
<p>about people being born on Mars.</p>
<p>And because it&rsquo;s a lower gravity environment,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re taller, they&rsquo;re more gangly,</p>
<p>if they were actually able to develop there.</p>
<p>And then they come back to Earth</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re like second class citizens</p>
<p>because they can&rsquo;t function here in the same way</p>
<p>because the gravity&rsquo;s too strong for them.</p>
<p>You see this in series like The Expanse</p>
<p>with the Belters and these different societies</p>
<p>that if we were to succeed in having human societies</p>
<p>grow up in different pockets,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not necessarily going to be easy for them</p>
<p>to always come back to Earth as their home.</p>
<p>Yeah, different cultures form,</p>
<p>which is the positive way of phrasing it.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s also, this human history teaches us</p>
<p>that we like to form the other.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s this kind of conflict</p>
<p>that naturally emerges.</p>
<p>Let me ask another sort of dark question.</p>
<p>What do you think about coming from a military family?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s still sadly wars in the world.</p>
<p>Do you think wars, military conflicts</p>
<p>will follow us into space, wars between nations?</p>
<p>Like from my perspective currently,</p>
<p>it just seems like space is a place</p>
<p>for scientists and engineers to explore ideas.</p>
<p>But the more and more progress you make,</p>
<p>does it worry you that nations start to step in</p>
<p>and form, that go out and fall out military conflict,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s in cyberspace, in space,</p>
<p>or actual hot war?</p>
<p>I am really concerned about that.</p>
<p>And I do think for decades,</p>
<p>the scientific community in space</p>
<p>has hung on to this notion</p>
<p>from the 1967 Outer Space Treaty,</p>
<p>which is space is the province of all humankind,</p>
<p>peaceful uses of outer space only.</p>
<p>But I do think the rise in tensions</p>
<p>and the geopolitical scene that we&rsquo;re seeing,</p>
<p>I do harbor a lot of concern about hot wars</p>
<p>following humanity out into space.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s worth trying to tie nations together</p>
<p>with more collaboration to avoid that happening.</p>
<p>The International Space Station is a great example.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s something like 18 countries</p>
<p>are party to this treaty.</p>
<p>It might be less, it might be more.</p>
<p>And then of course, there&rsquo;s a smaller number of countries</p>
<p>that actually send astronauts.</p>
<p>But even at the fall of the Soviet Union</p>
<p>and through some tense times with Russia,</p>
<p>the ISS had been a place where the US and Russia</p>
<p>were actually able to collaborate between Mir and ISS.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;d be really important right now in particular</p>
<p>to find other platforms where these hegemonic powers</p>
<p>in the world and developing world nations</p>
<p>can come and collaborate on the future of space</p>
<p>and purposefully intertwine our success</p>
<p>so that there&rsquo;s a danger to multiple parties</p>
<p>if somebody is a bad actor.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re now talking as there&rsquo;s a war in Ukraine</p>
<p>and I haven&rsquo;t been sleeping much.</p>
<p>I have family, friends, colleagues in both countries.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m just talking to a lot of people,</p>
<p>many of whom are crying, refugees.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a basic human compassion</p>
<p>and love for each other that I believe technology</p>
<p>can help catalyze and accelerate.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s also science.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something about rockets.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something about, and I mean like space exploration</p>
<p>that inspires the world about the positive possibilities</p>
<p>of the human species.</p>
<p>So in terms of Ukraine and Russia and China and India</p>
<p>and the United States and Europe and everywhere else,</p>
<p>it seems like collaborating on giant space projects</p>
<p>is one way to escape these wars,</p>
<p>to escape these sort of geopolitical conflicts.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s something,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s so much camaraderie to the whole thing.</p>
<p>And even in this little period of human history</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re living through, it seems like that&rsquo;s essential.</p>
<p>Even through this pandemic,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something so inspiring about those</p>
<p>like SpaceX rockets going up, for example.</p>
<p>This reinvigoration of the space exploration efforts</p>
<p>by the commercial sector, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>That was, as many of us have,</p>
<p>sort of some dark times during this pandemic,</p>
<p>just like loneliness and sometimes emotion and anger</p>
<p>and just hopelessness and politics.</p>
<p>And then you look at those rockets going up</p>
<p>and it just gives you hope.</p>
<p>So I think that&rsquo;s an understated sort of value</p>
<p>of space exploration,</p>
<p>is the thing that unites us and gives us hope.</p>
<p>Obviously also inspires young generations</p>
<p>and young minds to also contribute</p>
<p>in not necessarily in space exploration</p>
<p>but in all of science and literature and poetry.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something about when you look up to the stars</p>
<p>that makes you dream.</p>
<p>Very true.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s a really good reason</p>
<p>to sort of invest in this,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s building giant megastructure,</p>
<p>which is so freaking cool,</p>
<p>but also colonizing Mars.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s something to look forward to.</p>
<p>Something that, and not make it a domain of war,</p>
<p>but a domain of human collaboration</p>
<p>and human compassion, I think.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re the founder and director</p>
<p>of the MIT Space Exploration Initiative.</p>
<p>It includes a ton of projects.</p>
<p>So I just wanted to, they&rsquo;re focused, I guess, on life in space</p>
<p>from astrobiology, like we talked about, to habitats.</p>
<p>Are there some other interesting projects,</p>
<p>part of this initiative that pop to mind</p>
<p>that you find particularly cool?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>One is the future of in space manufacturing.</p>
<p>So if we&rsquo;re gonna build large scale space structures,</p>
<p>yes, it&rsquo;s great to ship them up from Earth</p>
<p>and self assemble them.</p>
<p>But what about extrusion in orbit?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of the best technologies</p>
<p>to leverage in microgravity</p>
<p>because you can extrude a particularly long beam</p>
<p>that would sag in a normal gravity environment,</p>
<p>but might be able to become the basis of a truss</p>
<p>or a large scale space structure.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re doing miniature tests of extrusion</p>
<p>and are excited to fly this</p>
<p>on the International Space Station in a few months.</p>
<p>We are working on swarm robots.</p>
<p>We have just announced actually MIT&rsquo;s return to the moon.</p>
<p>So my organization is leading this mission for MIT,</p>
<p>going back to the surface of the moon</p>
<p>as early as the end of this year, 2022,</p>
<p>maybe early 2023,</p>
<p>and trying to take data from our research payloads</p>
<p>at this historic South Pole site</p>
<p>where NASA is supposed to send the first humans back</p>
<p>on the Artemis III mission.</p>
<p>So our hope is to directly support that human mission</p>
<p>with our data.</p>
<p>How does that connect to the swarm aspects?</p>
<p>Does it connect?</p>
<p>Yeah, so we&rsquo;re actually gonna fly</p>
<p>one of the little astro ants.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the current plan.</p>
<p>One of the little swarm robots on the top of a rover.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s part of the mission.</p>
<p>Ants riding a rover?</p>
<p>Yes, exactly, an ant riding a rover.</p>
<p>That rover gets packed in a lander.</p>
<p>That lander gets packed in a SpaceX rocket.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a whole nesting dolls situation</p>
<p>to get to the moon.</p>
<p>Mother of robot dragons.</p>
<p>Yes, exactly.</p>
<p>So this one, a swarm of one?</p>
<p>Swarm of one, exactly.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re testing out.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a tech demonstration mission,</p>
<p>not a true swarm.</p>
<p>Yeah, there they are.</p>
<p>Those are the astro ants.</p>
<p>Wow, and this was a distributed system,</p>
<p>and in theory, you could have a ton of these.</p>
<p>Yes, these could also be centralized.</p>
<p>So they have wireless technology</p>
<p>that could also talk to a central base station</p>
<p>and will be assessing kind of case by case</p>
<p>whether it makes sense to operate them</p>
<p>in a decentralized swarm</p>
<p>or to command them in a centralized swarm.</p>
<p>Each robot is equipped with four magnetic wheels</p>
<p>which enable the robot to attach to any magnetic surface</p>
<p>so you can operate basically in any environment.</p>
<p>He tested the, we tested the mobility of all robots</p>
<p>on different materials in a microgravity environment.</p>
<p>On the vomit comet prior to going to the moon.</p>
<p>That must look so cool.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re basically moving along different</p>
<p>like metallic surfaces.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting when you, just a minute ago</p>
<p>talking about the reflection of</p>
<p>how space can be so aspirational and so uniting.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a great quote from Bill Anders</p>
<p>from the Apollo 8 mission to the moon,</p>
<p>which is he, it&rsquo;s the Earthrise photo that was taken</p>
<p>where you see the Earth coming up</p>
<p>over the horizon of the moon.</p>
<p>And the quote is something along the lines of</p>
<p>we came all the way to discover the moon</p>
<p>and what we really discovered was the Earth.</p>
<p>This really powerful image looking back.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;re also trying to think for our lunar mission</p>
<p>we realized we&rsquo;re a very privileged group at MIT</p>
<p>to get the opportunity to do this.</p>
<p>How could we bring humanity along with us?</p>
<p>And so one of the things we&rsquo;re still testing out</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if we&rsquo;re gonna be able to swing it</p>
<p>would be to do something like a Twitch plays Pokemon</p>
<p>but with the robot.</p>
<p>So let a lot of people on earth actually control the robot</p>
<p>or at least benefit from the data that we&rsquo;re gathering</p>
<p>and try to release the data openly.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re exploring a couple of different ideas</p>
<p>for how do we engage more people in this mission.</p>
<p>That would be surreal to be able to interact</p>
<p>in some way with the thing that&rsquo;s out there.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>On another surface.</p>
<p>Direct connection.</p>
<p>I think about artificial intelligence in that same way</p>
<p>which is like building robots</p>
<p>puts a mirror to us humans.</p>
<p>It makes us like wonder about like</p>
<p>what is intelligence?</p>
<p>What is consciousness?</p>
<p>And what is actually valuable about human beings?</p>
<p>When AI system learns to play chess better than humans</p>
<p>you start to let go of this idea</p>
<p>that humans are special because of intelligence.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s something else.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s maybe the flame of human consciousness.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the capacity to feel deeply</p>
<p>to sort of to both suffer and to love all those things.</p>
<p>And that somehow AI to me sort of puts a mirror to that.</p>
<p>You mentioned HAL 9000.</p>
<p>You have to bring it up with these swarm bots</p>
<p>crawling on the surface of your cocoon in space.</p>
<p>I mean, all right.</p>
<p>Let me steel man the HAL 9000 perspective here.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>The poor guy just wanted to maintain the mission</p>
<p>and the astronauts were,</p>
<p>I mean, I don&rsquo;t know if people often talk about that</p>
<p>but like doctors have to make difficult decisions too.</p>
<p>When there&rsquo;s limited resources</p>
<p>you actually do have to sacrifice human life often</p>
<p>because you have to make decisions.</p>
<p>And I think HAL is probably making that kind of decision</p>
<p>about what&rsquo;s more important,</p>
<p>the lives of individual astronauts or the mission.</p>
<p>And I feel like AI and other humans</p>
<p>will need to make these decisions.</p>
<p>And it also feels like AI systems will need to help</p>
<p>make those decisions.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I guess my question is about</p>
<p>greater and greater collective intelligence by systems.</p>
<p>Do you worry about that?</p>
<p>What is the right way to sort of solve this problem</p>
<p>keeping a human in the loop?</p>
<p>Do you think about this kind of stuff</p>
<p>or are they sufficiently dumb now the robots</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s not yet on the horizon to think about?</p>
<p>I think it should be on the horizon.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always good to think about these things early</p>
<p>because we make a lot of technical design decisions</p>
<p>at this phase working with swarm robots</p>
<p>that it would be better to have thought</p>
<p>about some of these questions early</p>
<p>in the life cycle of a project.</p>
<p>There is a real interest in NASA right now</p>
<p>thinking about the future of human robot interaction, HRI,</p>
<p>and what is the right synergy</p>
<p>in terms of level of control for the human</p>
<p>versus level of dependence or control for the robot.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re beginning to test out more of these scenarios.</p>
<p>For example, the Gateway Space Station,</p>
<p>which is meant to be in orbit around the moon</p>
<p>as a staging base for the surface operations,</p>
<p>is meant to be able to function autonomously</p>
<p>with no humans in it for months at a time</p>
<p>because they think it&rsquo;s gonna be seasonal.</p>
<p>They think we might not be constantly staffing it.</p>
<p>So this will be a really great test of,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know that anybody&rsquo;s yet worried</p>
<p>about HAL 9000 evolving,</p>
<p>but certainly just the robustness of some of these AI systems</p>
<p>that might be asked to autonomously maintain the station</p>
<p>while the humans are away or detection algorithms</p>
<p>that are gonna say, if you had a human pilot,</p>
<p>they might see debris in orbit and steer around it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;ll be a lot of autonomous navigation</p>
<p>that has to happen.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;ll be one of the early test beds</p>
<p>where we&rsquo;ll start to get a little bit closer to that future.</p>
<p>Well, the HRI component is really interesting to me,</p>
<p>especially when the I includes like almost friendship</p>
<p>because people don&rsquo;t realize this, I think,</p>
<p>that we humans long for connection.</p>
<p>And when you have even a basic interaction</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just like supposed to be just like serving you</p>
<p>or something, you still project,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s still a source of meaning and connection.</p>
<p>And so you do have to think about that.</p>
<p>I mean, HAL 9000, the movie maybe doesn&rsquo;t portray it</p>
<p>that way, but I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s a relationship there</p>
<p>between the astronauts and the robot,</p>
<p>especially when you have greater and greater level</p>
<p>of intelligence.</p>
<p>And maybe that addresses the happiness question too.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think there&rsquo;s a great book by Kate Darling,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s one of my colleagues at MIT.</p>
<p>Yeah, she&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s already been on this podcast,</p>
<p>but we talk all the time and we&rsquo;re supposed to talk</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ve been missing each other</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re gonna make it happen soon.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Come down to Texas, Kate.</p>
<p>All right, anyway, yeah, she&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>She has this book, her whole work is about this.</p>
<p>Connection with robots, yeah.</p>
<p>This beautiful connection that we have with robots,</p>
<p>but I think it&rsquo;s greater and greater importance</p>
<p>when it&rsquo;s out in space,</p>
<p>because it could help alleviate some of the loneliness.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>One of the projects in the book that I gave you,</p>
<p>which is this catalog of the projects</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve worked on over the last five years,</p>
<p>is this social robot that was developed at the Media Lab.</p>
<p>And we, one of the first years in 2017</p>
<p>that we flew a zero G flight,</p>
<p>we took the social robot along</p>
<p>and tried to do a little bit</p>
<p>of a very scaled down human study</p>
<p>to look at these questions,</p>
<p>because you do imagine that we would form a bond,</p>
<p>a real bond with the social robots</p>
<p>that might be not just serving us on a mission,</p>
<p>but really be our teammates on a future mission.</p>
<p>And I do think that that could have a powerful role</p>
<p>in the mental health and just the stability of a crew</p>
<p>is to have some other robot friends come along.</p>
<p>What do you, by the way, the book you mentioned</p>
<p>is into the Anthropocosmos,</p>
<p>a whole space catalog from the space catalog.</p>
<p>Get that reference.</p>
<p>Yeah, so call out to Earth catalog,</p>
<p>a whole space catalog</p>
<p>from the MIT Space Exploration Initiative.</p>
<p>What about the happiness?</p>
<p>You said that that&rsquo;s one of the problems</p>
<p>of when you&rsquo;re out in space.</p>
<p>How do you keep humans happy?</p>
<p>Again, asking for a friend.</p>
<p>Yes, I mean, one of the big challenges</p>
<p>is you can&rsquo;t just open a window</p>
<p>or walk out a door and blow off steam, right?</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t just go somewhere to clear your head.</p>
<p>And in that sense, you need to build habitats</p>
<p>that are homes that really care for the humans inside them</p>
<p>and have, whether it&rsquo;s biophilia</p>
<p>and a place where you can go and feel like you&rsquo;re in nature</p>
<p>or a VR headset, which for some people is a poor simulacrum</p>
<p>but is maybe better than nothing.</p>
<p>You need to be thinking</p>
<p>about these technological interventions</p>
<p>that are gonna have to be part of your home</p>
<p>and be part of your maybe day to day ritual</p>
<p>to keep you steady and balanced and happy</p>
<p>or feeling fulfilled.</p>
<p>What about other humans, relationship with other humans?</p>
<p>Do those get weird</p>
<p>when you get past a certain number of humans?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not an expert in this area</p>
<p>but an anecdote that I&rsquo;ll share.</p>
<p>My understanding is that NASA has still not decided</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s better to send married couples</p>
<p>or single crew members in terms of,</p>
<p>you want some level of stability,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t wanna have the drama of romantic relationships</p>
<p>like you&rsquo;re alluding to before,</p>
<p>but they can&rsquo;t decide because married couples also fight</p>
<p>and have a really tough dynamic.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s a lot of open questions still to answer</p>
<p>about what is the ideal psychological makeup of a crew?</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re starting to test some of these things</p>
<p>with the civilian crews that are growing up</p>
<p>with Inspiration4, like last fall with SpaceX</p>
<p>and Axe One that&rsquo;s gonna fly in a few days here in March.</p>
<p>As we begin to lengthen the time of those civilian crews,</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;ll start to learn a little bit more</p>
<p>about just average everyday human to human dynamics</p>
<p>and not the astronauts that are themselves selected</p>
<p>to be perfect human specimens, very good to work with,</p>
<p>easy to get along with.</p>
<p>I wish you collected more data about this pandemic</p>
<p>because I feel like it&rsquo;s a good rough simulation</p>
<p>of what it&rsquo;d be like out in space.</p>
<p>A lot of people are locked down, some married couples,</p>
<p>I think a lot of marriages broke up,</p>
<p>a lot of marriages got closer together.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like, and then the single people,</p>
<p>some of them went off the cliff</p>
<p>and some of them discovered their new happiness</p>
<p>and meaning and so on.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a beautiful little experiment, a painful one.</p>
<p>Is there a thorough way to really test that?</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s such a costly experiment</p>
<p>to send humans up there,</p>
<p>but I guess you can always return back to Earth</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s not working out.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what we hope, that&rsquo;s what you hope.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have like a Apollo 13 situation</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t quite make it back.</p>
<p>But yeah, this is also why Mars is such a challenge.</p>
<p>The moon is only three days away.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a lot quicker to recover from</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s a psychological problem with the crew</p>
<p>or any type of maintenance problem, anything.</p>
<p>Three years is such a challenge</p>
<p>compared to these other domains</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve been getting more used to</p>
<p>in terms of human spaceflight.</p>
<p>So this is a question that we will need to have explored more</p>
<p>before we start really sending crews to Mars.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re a young scientist, do you think in your lifetime</p>
<p>you will go out into orbit,</p>
<p>you will go out beyond into deep space</p>
<p>and potentially step, you,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you can call yourself a civilian.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s what you count as,</p>
<p>but you as a curious ant from MIT land step on Mars.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a firm, that&rsquo;s a firm.</p>
<p>Are you coming back?</p>
<p>Firm, yes, yeah, I&rsquo;m coming back.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want that one way mission, I want the two way mission.</p>
<p>But yes, I mean, I think we&rsquo;re already talking</p>
<p>about a pretty near term opportunity</p>
<p>where I could send graduate students</p>
<p>to the International Space Station.</p>
<p>Yeah, not a sacrifice, but send graduate students.</p>
<p>For the experience.</p>
<p>Send graduate students to the ISS to do their research.</p>
<p>I do think you and I both would have an opportunity</p>
<p>to go to a lunar base of some sort within our lifetime.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a good chance if we really wanted to,</p>
<p>we might have to really advocate for it,</p>
<p>apply to an astronaut program.</p>
<p>There will be some avenues for humans</p>
<p>in our lifetime to go to Mars.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the bar for like health?</p>
<p>Do you think that bar will keep getting lower and lower</p>
<p>in terms of how healthy, how athletic,</p>
<p>like how the psychological profile,</p>
<p>all those kinds of things?</p>
<p>Yeah, for one, we&rsquo;re gonna build more robust habitats</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t depend on astronauts</p>
<p>being so impeccably well trained.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re gonna make it better for inclusion</p>
<p>and just opening access to space.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a fantastic group called Astro Access</p>
<p>that is already helping disabled space flyers</p>
<p>do zero G flights and potentially get access to the ISS.</p>
<p>And some of the things that we think of</p>
<p>as disabilities on earth are hyper abilities in space.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need really powerful legs in space.</p>
<p>What you&rsquo;d really benefit from having is a third arm,</p>
<p>more ways to kind of move yourself around</p>
<p>and grip and interact.</p>
<p>So we are already seeing a much more open minded approach</p>
<p>to who gets to go to space and Astro Access</p>
<p>is a wonderful organization doing some of that work.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m hoping introversion will also be a superpower in space.</p>
<p>Okay, well, first I&rsquo;d love to get your opinion</p>
<p>on commercial space flight, what SpaceX,</p>
<p>what Blue Origin are doing.</p>
<p>And also another question on top of that is,</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;ve worked with a lot of different kinds</p>
<p>of people, culturally, what&rsquo;s the difference</p>
<p>between SpaceX or commercial type of efforts</p>
<p>NASA and MIT?</p>
<p>And academia.</p>
<p>Academia.</p>
<p>Yeah, so the first part of your question,</p>
<p>I am thrilled by all of the commercial activity in space.</p>
<p>It has really empowered our program.</p>
<p>So instead of me waiting for five years to get a grant</p>
<p>and get the money from the grant</p>
<p>and only then can you send a project to space,</p>
<p>I go out and I fundraise a lot like a startup founder</p>
<p>and I directly buy access to space</p>
<p>on the International Space Station</p>
<p>through SpaceX or NanoRacks, same with Blue Origin</p>
<p>and their suborbital craft, same with Axiom now.</p>
<p>Axiom&rsquo;s making plans for their own commercial space station.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not out of the realm of possibility,</p>
<p>but in a few years, I will rent lab space in orbit.</p>
<p>I will rent a module from the Axiom space station</p>
<p>or the orbital reef, which is the Blue Origin space station</p>
<p>or NanoRacks is thinking about Starlab Oasis.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s probably some other companies</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m not even aware of yet</p>
<p>that are doing commercial space habitats.</p>
<p>So I think that&rsquo;s fabulous</p>
<p>and really empowering for our research.</p>
<p>Is it affordable?</p>
<p>So like loosely speaking, does it become affordable</p>
<p>for like MIT type of research lab?</p>
<p>Does it, or does it need to be a multi university</p>
<p>like a gigantic effort, a consortium thing?</p>
<p>One of the reasons we&rsquo;re spinning out Aurelia</p>
<p>is we actually realized it&rsquo;s cheap enough.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t even have to be MIT.</p>
<p>And we wanted to start democratizing access</p>
<p>to these spaceflight opportunities</p>
<p>to a much broader swath of humanity.</p>
<p>Could you take a Khan Academy educational course</p>
<p>about, hey, students around the world,</p>
<p>this is how you get ready for a zero G flight.</p>
<p>And by the way, come fly with us next year,</p>
<p>which is something we&rsquo;re gonna do with Aurelius.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna bring much more just kind of day to day folks</p>
<p>on zero G flights and get them access</p>
<p>to engaging in the space industry.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s become cheap enough</p>
<p>and the prices have dropped enough to consider even that.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p>It definitely doesn&rsquo;t have to be a consortium</p>
<p>of universities anymore.</p>
<p>Depends on what you wanna fly.</p>
<p>If you wanna fly James Webb,</p>
<p>a huge telescope that&rsquo;s decades in the making,</p>
<p>sure, you need a NASA allocation budget.</p>
<p>You need billions.</p>
<p>But for a lot of the stuff in the book</p>
<p>and our research portfolio,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s actually becoming far more accessible.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a commercial.</p>
<p>What about NASA and MIT academia?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think people have been worried about NASA</p>
<p>the last few years because in some people&rsquo;s minds,</p>
<p>they are ceding ground to these commercial efforts,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s really not what&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>NASA empowered these commercial efforts</p>
<p>because they wanna free themselves up to go to Mars</p>
<p>and go to Europa and continue being</p>
<p>that really aspirational force for humanity</p>
<p>of pushing the boundary, always pushing the boundary.</p>
<p>And if they were anchored in low earth orbit,</p>
<p>maintaining a space station indefinitely,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s so much a part of their budget</p>
<p>that it was keeping them from being able to do more.</p>
<p>So it actually is really fantastic for NASA</p>
<p>to have grown this commercial ecosystem</p>
<p>and then that frees NASA up to go further.</p>
<p>And in academia, we like to think that we will be able</p>
<p>to do the provocative next generation research</p>
<p>that is going to unlock things at that frontier.</p>
<p>And we can partner with NASA.</p>
<p>We can go through a program</p>
<p>if we wanna send a probe out really far,</p>
<p>but we can also partner with SpaceX</p>
<p>and see what human life in a SpaceX Mars settlement</p>
<p>might look like and how we could design for that.</p>
<p>Speaking of projects, maybe are there other projects</p>
<p>that pop to mind from the Space Exploration Initiative</p>
<p>or maybe stuff from the book that you can mention?</p>
<p>Something super cool.</p>
<p>I mean, everything we&rsquo;ve been talking about is cool,</p>
<p>but just something that pops to mind again.</p>
<p>Yeah, so we talked about life in space</p>
<p>and you might need more arms than legs.</p>
<p>One of the projects by Valentina Sumini</p>
<p>was a air powered robotics tail.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a soft robotics tail</p>
<p>that essentially has a little camera on the back end of it,</p>
<p>can do computer vision and knows where to grapple.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s behind you.</p>
<p>It grapples onto something and holds you in space</p>
<p>and then you can actually free up</p>
<p>both of your hands to work.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re already starting to think about</p>
<p>the design of bionic humans or prosthetics</p>
<p>or things that would make you kind of like a cyborg</p>
<p>to augment your capabilities</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re in a space environment.</p>
<p>How would you control something like that?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s kind of like a, I mean, you can&rsquo;t call it a leg,</p>
<p>but whatever, it&rsquo;s a. An additional appendage.</p>
<p>Appendage, so how would you,</p>
<p>what are ideas for controlling something like that?</p>
<p>Yeah, so right now it&rsquo;s super, yeah, there you go.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s cool.</p>
<p>Right now it&rsquo;s super manual.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s basically just like a kind of a set pattern</p>
<p>of inflating as we&rsquo;re testing it.</p>
<p>But in the future, if we had a Neuralink,</p>
<p>I mean, this is something that you could imagine</p>
<p>directly controlling,</p>
<p>just thinking thoughts and controlling it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a ways away.</p>
<p>Yeah, so we talked about on the biology side,</p>
<p>astrobiology, there&rsquo;s probably agriculture stuff.</p>
<p>Is there other things that kind of feed the ecosystem</p>
<p>of out in space for survival</p>
<p>or the robotics architectures, the self assembly stuff?</p>
<p>So kind of combining something we were talking about,</p>
<p>you can form these relationships with objects</p>
<p>and anthropomorphize.</p>
<p>One of the things that we&rsquo;re thinking about for agriculture</p>
<p>created by Manwe and Somu, so two students at MIT,</p>
<p>was this little, it looks like a planet,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s inspired by, I think, a Mandala</p>
<p>or Nepalese spinning wheel.</p>
<p>And you plant plants on the inside</p>
<p>and the astronaut has to spin it every day</p>
<p>to help the plants survive.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a way to give the astronauts</p>
<p>something to care about,</p>
<p>something that they are responsible for keeping alive</p>
<p>and can really invest themselves in.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not necessary, right?</p>
<p>We have other ways to grow in orbit,</p>
<p>hydroponics, liquid medium,</p>
<p>trying to keep the liquid around the plant roots is hard</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s no gravity to pull it down</p>
<p>in a particular direction.</p>
<p>But what I loved about this project was they said,</p>
<p>sure, we have ways that the plants could grow on their own,</p>
<p>but the astronauts might want to care for it</p>
<p>in the same way that we have little plants</p>
<p>that come to be important to us, little plant friends.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s AgriFuge, that&rsquo;s an early model</p>
<p>of this manually spinning plant habitat.</p>
<p>I guess this is the best of academic research</p>
<p>is you can do these kinds of wild ideas.</p>
<p>Wild ideas, yeah.</p>
<p>Well, I get to spend quite a bit of time</p>
<p>with Mr. Elon Musk and he&rsquo;s very stressed,</p>
<p>especially about Starship</p>
<p>and all those kinds of engineering efforts.</p>
<p>What do you think about how damn hard it is</p>
<p>to get out of space?</p>
<p>Like, are we humans gonna be able to do this?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, I think it feels like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an engineering problem, it&rsquo;s a scientific problem,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s also just a motivation problem</p>
<p>for the entire human species.</p>
<p>And you also need to have superstar researchers</p>
<p>and engineers working on it.</p>
<p>So you have to get like the best people in the world,</p>
<p>inspire them and starting from a young age and kind of.</p>
<p>Almost inculcating us into why we do it.</p>
<p>I mean, I guess that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s exciting.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t know if we&rsquo;re gonna be able to pull this off.</p>
<p>Like, we could like fail miserably.</p>
<p>And that, I suppose, I mean,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s where the best of engineering is done</p>
<p>is like success is not guaranteed.</p>
<p>And even if it happens, it might be very painful.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s so special</p>
<p>about what Elon is doing with SpaceX</p>
<p>is he takes these risks and he tests iteratively</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;ll, we&rsquo;ll see the spectacular failures</p>
<p>on the path to a successful Starship.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s something that, you know, people have said,</p>
<p>why isn&rsquo;t NASA doing that?</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s cause NASA is doing that with taxpayer dollars</p>
<p>and we would all revolt if we saw NASA failing</p>
<p>at all these different stages.</p>
<p>But that level of, you know,</p>
<p>spiral engineering theory of development</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t super impressive.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a really interesting approach</p>
<p>that SpaceX has taken.</p>
<p>And I think between people like Elon and Jeff Bezos</p>
<p>and Firefly and NASA and ESO, we are gonna get there.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re building the road to space.</p>
<p>These trailblazers are doing it.</p>
<p>And now part of the challenge is to get the rest</p>
<p>of the public to understand that it&rsquo;s happening, right?</p>
<p>A lot of people don&rsquo;t know that we&rsquo;re going back</p>
<p>to the moon, that we&rsquo;re gonna send the first woman</p>
<p>to the moon within a few years.</p>
<p>A lot of people don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>that there are commercial space stations in orbit,</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s not just NASA that does space stuff.</p>
<p>So we have a big challenge to get more of humanity excited</p>
<p>and educated and involved again,</p>
<p>kind of like in the Apollo era</p>
<p>where it was a big deal for everybody.</p>
<p>Well, a lot of that is also one of the big impressive things</p>
<p>that Elon does, I think, extremely well</p>
<p>is the social media, is the getting people excited.</p>
<p>And I think that actually, he&rsquo;s helped NASA</p>
<p>step their game up in terms of social media.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something about, yeah, the storytelling,</p>
<p>but also not like, you know, like authentic</p>
<p>and just real and raw engineering.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of excitement for that humor and fun also.</p>
<p>All of those things you realize,</p>
<p>the thing that make up the virality of the meme</p>
<p>is beautiful, you have to kind of embrace that.</p>
<p>And to me, this kind of,</p>
<p>I criticize a lot of companies based on this.</p>
<p>I talked to a bunch of CEOs and so on,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just like, there&rsquo;s a caution,</p>
<p>like let us do this like press conference thing</p>
<p>where when the final product is ready</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s overproduced,</p>
<p>as opposed to the raw, the gritty just showed off.</p>
<p>I mean, something that I think MIT is very good at doing</p>
<p>is just showing the raw, by nature, the mess of it.</p>
<p>And the mess of it is beautiful</p>
<p>and people get really excited and failure is really exciting.</p>
<p>When the thing blows up and you&rsquo;re like, oh shit,</p>
<p>that makes it even more exciting when it doesn&rsquo;t blow up.</p>
<p>And doing all of that on social media</p>
<p>and showing also the humans behind it,</p>
<p>the individual young researchers or the engineers</p>
<p>or the leaders where everything&rsquo;s at stake.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, I think I&rsquo;m really excited about that.</p>
<p>I do want MIT to do that more for students</p>
<p>to show off their stuff and not be pressured</p>
<p>to do this kind of generic official presentation,</p>
<p>but show their, become a YouTuber also.</p>
<p>Like show off your raw research</p>
<p>as you&rsquo;re working on it in the early days.</p>
<p>I hope that&rsquo;s the future.</p>
<p>Things like, I was teasing about TikTok earlier,</p>
<p>but these kinds of things I think inspire young people</p>
<p>to show off their stuff, to show their true self,</p>
<p>the rawness of it,</p>
<p>because I think that&rsquo;s where engineering is best.</p>
<p>And I think that will inspire people</p>
<p>about all the cool stuff we could do out in space.</p>
<p>I should say, I couldn&rsquo;t agree more.</p>
<p>And I actually think that this is why we need</p>
<p>a real life Starfleet Academy right now.</p>
<p>It was the place where the space cadets got to go</p>
<p>to learn about how to engage in a future of life in space.</p>
<p>And we can do it in a much better way.</p>
<p>There are a bunch of groups that traditionally</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t thought that they could engage in aerospace,</p>
<p>whether it&rsquo;s because you were told</p>
<p>you had to be into math and science.</p>
<p>Now we need space lawyers,</p>
<p>we need space artists like Grimes, right?</p>
<p>We need really creative, profoundly interesting people</p>
<p>to wanna see themselves in that future.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s a big challenge to us</p>
<p>in the space industry to also do some more diversity,</p>
<p>equity and inclusion,</p>
<p>and show a broader swath of society</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s a future for them</p>
<p>in this space exploration vision.</p>
<p>Let me push back on one thing.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t need space lawyers.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just kidding.</p>
<p>Okay, it&rsquo;s a joke.</p>
<p>We do, we do, we do.</p>
<p>Okay, we do.</p>
<p>The lawyers are great, I love them.</p>
<p>Okay, let me ask a big, ridiculous question.</p>
<p>What is the most beautiful idea to you</p>
<p>about space exploration?</p>
<p>Whether it&rsquo;s the engineering, the astrobiology,</p>
<p>the science, the inspiration, the human happiness,</p>
<p>or aliens, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>What do you, like, inspires you every day</p>
<p>in terms of its beauty, in terms of its awe?</p>
<p>As a ex physicist, what I&rsquo;ve always found so profound</p>
<p>is just that at really, really small scales,</p>
<p>like particle physics,</p>
<p>and really, really big scales, like astrophysics,</p>
<p>there are similarities in the way</p>
<p>that those systems behave and look,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a certain beautiful symmetry in the universe</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just kind of waiting for us</p>
<p>to tie together the physics and really understand it.</p>
<p>That is something that just really captivates me,</p>
<p>and I would love to,</p>
<p>even though I&rsquo;m now much more</p>
<p>on the applied space exploration side,</p>
<p>I really try to keep up with what&rsquo;s happening</p>
<p>in those physics areas,</p>
<p>because I think that will be a huge answer for humanity</p>
<p>along the lines of, are we alone in the universe?</p>
<p>One of the fascinating things about you</p>
<p>is you have a degree in physics, mathematics,</p>
<p>and philosophy, and now, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>would you call it aerospace engineering maybe kind of thing?</p>
<p>So you have at a foot in all of these worlds,</p>
<p>the theoretic, the beauty of that world,</p>
<p>and the philosophy somehow is in there,</p>
<p>and now the very practical, pragmatic implementation</p>
<p>of all these wild ideas,</p>
<p>plus your incredible communicator, all of those things.</p>
<p>What did you pick up from those different disciplines?</p>
<p>Or maybe I&rsquo;m just romanticizing</p>
<p>all those different disciplines,</p>
<p>but what did you pick up from the variety</p>
<p>of that physics, mathematics, philosophy?</p>
<p>What I loved about having this chance</p>
<p>to do a liberal arts education</p>
<p>was trying to understand the human condition,</p>
<p>and I think more designers for space exploration</p>
<p>should be thinking about that,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s so much depth of,</p>
<p>like we were talking about,</p>
<p>issues and opportunities around human connection,</p>
<p>human life, meaning in life.</p>
<p>How do you find fulfillment or happiness?</p>
<p>And I think if you approach these questions</p>
<p>just purely from the standpoint of an engineer</p>
<p>or a scientist, you&rsquo;ll miss some of what</p>
<p>makes it a life worth living.</p>
<p>And so I love being able to combine</p>
<p>some of this notion of philosophy</p>
<p>and the human condition with my work,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m also a pragmatist,</p>
<p>and I didn&rsquo;t want to stay just purely</p>
<p>in these big picture questions about the universe.</p>
<p>I wanted to have an impact on society,</p>
<p>and I also felt like I had such a wonderful childhood</p>
<p>and a really fantastic setup that I owe society some work</p>
<p>to really make a positive impact</p>
<p>for a broader swath of citizens.</p>
<p>And so that kind of led me from the physics domain</p>
<p>to thinking about engineering and practical questions</p>
<p>for life in space.</p>
<p>In physics, was there a dream?</p>
<p>Are you also captivated by this search</p>
<p>for the theory of everything that kind of unlocks</p>
<p>the deeper and deeper, in the simple, elegant way,</p>
<p>the function of our universe?</p>
<p>Do you think that&rsquo;ll be useful for us</p>
<p>for the actual practical engineering things</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re working on now?</p>
<p>It could be.</p>
<p>I mean, I worked at CERN for two summers in undergrad,</p>
<p>and we were looking for supersymmetry,</p>
<p>which was one of these alternatives to the standard model.</p>
<p>And it was sad because my professors</p>
<p>were getting sadder and sadder</p>
<p>because they weren&rsquo;t finding it.</p>
<p>They were excluding what we would call this parameter space</p>
<p>of finding these supersymmetric particles.</p>
<p>But the search for what that theory of everything could be,</p>
<p>or a grand unified theory that kind of answers</p>
<p>some of the holes within the standard model of physics</p>
<p>would presumably kind of unlock a better understanding</p>
<p>of certain fundamental physical laws</p>
<p>that we should be able to build a better understanding</p>
<p>of engineering and day to day services from that.</p>
<p>It might not be an immediately obvious thing.</p>
<p>When we discovered the Higgs boson,</p>
<p>I was there at CERN that day.</p>
<p>It was July 4th, 2012 that it was announced.</p>
<p>We all waited like nerds overnight in line</p>
<p>to get into the announcement chamber.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d never waited for even like a Harry Potter premiere</p>
<p>in my life, but we waited for this announcement</p>
<p>of the Higgs boson to get into the chamber overnight.</p>
<p>But did that immediately translate</p>
<p>to technology for engineering?</p>
<p>No, but it&rsquo;s still a really important part</p>
<p>of our understanding of these fundamental laws of physics.</p>
<p>And so I don&rsquo;t know that it&rsquo;s always immediate,</p>
<p>but I think it is really critical knowledge</p>
<p>for humanity to seek.</p>
<p>It might just shake up understanding of the world.</p>
<p>What scares me is it might help us create</p>
<p>more dangerous weapons.</p>
<p>So, and then we&rsquo;ll figure out that great filter situation.</p>
<p>And I still believe that human compassion and love</p>
<p>is actually the way to defend against all these greater</p>
<p>and greater and more impressive weapons.</p>
<p>Let me ask a weird question in terms</p>
<p>of you disagreeing with others.</p>
<p>What important idea do you believe is true</p>
<p>that many others don&rsquo;t agree with you on?</p>
<p>Maybe, it&rsquo;s a tough question.</p>
<p>You might have to think about that one,</p>
<p>but whether it&rsquo;s very specific,</p>
<p>like which material to use or something</p>
<p>about a particular project,</p>
<p>or it could be grand priorities on missions.</p>
<p>I think one you actually mentioned is interesting</p>
<p>is like the thing we should be looking for</p>
<p>is like colonization of space</p>
<p>versus colonization of planets.</p>
<p>Meaning like.</p>
<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s probably my best hot take</p>
<p>that people would disagree with me on</p>
<p>is life in floating cities</p>
<p>as opposed to life on the surface.</p>
<p>How do you envision that like spread of humans?</p>
<p>Cause you said at the beginning of the conversation,</p>
<p>something about like scale, increasing the scale</p>
<p>of basically humans in space.</p>
<p>Are they just like in, they&rsquo;re in orbit</p>
<p>and then they get a little farther and farther out.</p>
<p>Like, do you see this kind of floating cities</p>
<p>just getting farther and farther from earth?</p>
<p>They can always kind of return,</p>
<p>but like if you look a few centuries from now,</p>
<p>do you just see us, all these like floating cities.</p>
<p>Like Amoeba.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And it just kind of envelops the space around us</p>
<p>in these like neighborhoods.</p>
<p>Yeah, in these neighborhoods.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like rural and there&rsquo;s like giant structures</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s small pirate structures</p>
<p>and that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Pirate structures, yeah.</p>
<p>I think low earth orbit might come to look like that.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a really interesting regulatory challenge</p>
<p>to make sure that there&rsquo;s some cross purposes.</p>
<p>So the more cool space cities we have in orbit,</p>
<p>the more shiny objects in the night sky,</p>
<p>the worse it is for astronomers</p>
<p>in a really kind of overly simplified case.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s some pushback to this like Amoebaing</p>
<p>where we just grow kind of incongruously</p>
<p>or indiscriminately as an Amoeba in low earth orbit.</p>
<p>Beyond that though, I think we&rsquo;ll grow in pockets</p>
<p>where there are resources.</p>
<p>So we won&rsquo;t just expand around the gravity well of earth.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll do some development around the moon,</p>
<p>some development around asteroids,</p>
<p>some development around Mars,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;ll always be purposes</p>
<p>for which we wanna go down to a physical object</p>
<p>and study it or extract something or learn from it.</p>
<p>But I think we&rsquo;ll grow in fits and starts in pockets.</p>
<p>Some of the coolest pockets are the gravity balanced pockets</p>
<p>like the Lagrange points, which is where we just sent,</p>
<p>we not me personally, but NASA just sent James Webb,</p>
<p>the big telescope, I think it&rsquo;s at L2.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the nice feature about those pockets?</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a stable orbit.</p>
<p>There are several different Lagrange points.</p>
<p>And so it just requires less energy</p>
<p>to stay where you&rsquo;re trying to stay.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s also fascinating is the interaction</p>
<p>between nations on that regard.</p>
<p>Like who owns that?</p>
<p>Would you say in those floating cities,</p>
<p>do you envision independent governments?</p>
<p>That was gonna be my next answer to you,</p>
<p>which pushed me harder for a more provocative question</p>
<p>where I might disagree with other people.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t yet have my own opinions fully formed on this,</p>
<p>but we are trying to figure out right now</p>
<p>what happens to the moon</p>
<p>with all of these first come first served actors</p>
<p>just arriving and setting precedents</p>
<p>that might really affect future access.</p>
<p>And one example is property rights.</p>
<p>We do want companies that have the expertise</p>
<p>to go to the moon and mine stuff</p>
<p>that will help us develop a human settlement there</p>
<p>or a gateway, but companies need to know generally</p>
<p>that they have rights to a certain area</p>
<p>or that they have some legal right to sell things</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re getting.</p>
<p>Does that mean we&rsquo;re gonna grant property rights</p>
<p>on the moon to companies who has the right</p>
<p>to give that right away?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a bunch of really kind of gnarly questions</p>
<p>that we have to think about,</p>
<p>which is why I think we need space lawyers.</p>
<p>Maybe that&rsquo;s the true provocative answers.</p>
<p>I think we need space lawyers.</p>
<p>I mean, yeah, yeah, I mean, but those questions,</p>
<p>again, as you said eloquently,</p>
<p>will help us answer questions about here on Earth.</p>
<p>We hope so, yeah.</p>
<p>It is a little strange.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s obvious, but it&rsquo;s also strange</p>
<p>if you look at the big picture of it all</p>
<p>that we draw these like borders around geographical areas</p>
<p>and we say, this is mine, like,</p>
<p>and then we fight wars over what&rsquo;s mine</p>
<p>and not, it seems like there&rsquo;s possible alternatives,</p>
<p>but also it seems like there needs to be a public ownership</p>
<p>of some parts, like, what is it?</p>
<p>Central Park in New York.</p>
<p>Is there something like preserving?</p>
<p>The commons.</p>
<p>Yeah, the commons.</p>
<p>The commons.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why we titled the book Into the Anthropocosmos.</p>
<p>We know it&rsquo;s a long and kind of a mouthful,</p>
<p>but this notion of the Anthropocene,</p>
<p>we have a lot of commons problems in humanity.</p>
<p>How are we treating the Earth, global climate change?</p>
<p>How are we gonna treat and behave in space?</p>
<p>How can we be responsible stewards of the space commons?</p>
<p>And I would love to see an approach to the moon</p>
<p>that is commons based, but it&rsquo;s hard to know</p>
<p>who would be the protector or the enforcer of that.</p>
<p>And if it&rsquo;s, which it will be probably in the early days,</p>
<p>a lot of companies sort of working on the moon,</p>
<p>working on Mars, working out in space,</p>
<p>it feels like there still needs to be</p>
<p>a civilian representation of like the greater effort</p>
<p>or something like that.</p>
<p>Like where there should be a president,</p>
<p>there should be a democracy of some kind</p>
<p>where people can vote.</p>
<p>Some representative government.</p>
<p>Those are all, again, the same human questions.</p>
<p>What advice would you give to a young person today</p>
<p>thinking about what they wanna do with their life, career?</p>
<p>So somebody in high school, somebody in college,</p>
<p>maybe somebody that looks up to the stars</p>
<p>and dreams to one day, take a one way ticket to Mars</p>
<p>or to contribute something to the effort.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say you should feel empowered</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s really the first time in human history</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re at this cusp of interplanetary civilization.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;re gonna lapse back from it.</p>
<p>So the future is incredibly bright for young people</p>
<p>that even younger than you and I,</p>
<p>who will actually really get a chance to go to Mars</p>
<p>for certain.</p>
<p>The other thing I would say is be open minded</p>
<p>about what your own interests are.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think you anymore have to be shoehorned</p>
<p>into a particular career to be welcomed</p>
<p>into the future of space exploration.</p>
<p>If you are an artist and that is your passion,</p>
<p>but you would love to do space art or if not space art,</p>
<p>use your artistry to communicate a feeling</p>
<p>or a message about space.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a role that we desperately need</p>
<p>just as much as we need space scientists</p>
<p>and space engineers, so.</p>
<p>Well, when you look at your own life,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re an incredibly accomplished scientist,</p>
<p>young scientist, but you know,</p>
<p>and you hopped around from physics to aerospace.</p>
<p>So going from the biggest theoretical ideas</p>
<p>to the biggest practical ideas.</p>
<p>Is there something from your own journey</p>
<p>you can give advice to,</p>
<p>like how to end up doing incredible research at MIT?</p>
<p>Maybe the role of the university and college</p>
<p>and education and learning, all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say one piece of advice is find really good teammates</p>
<p>because I get to be the one that&rsquo;s talking to you,</p>
<p>but there are 50 graduate students, staff and faculty</p>
<p>that are part of my organization back at MIT.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m actually, you guys can&rsquo;t see it on camera,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m sitting here with my co founder and COO,</p>
<p>Danielle DeLotte, and that is really what makes</p>
<p>these large scale challenges for humanity possible</p>
<p>is really fantastic teams working together</p>
<p>to scale more than what I could do alone.</p>
<p>So I think that that&rsquo;s an important model</p>
<p>that we don&rsquo;t talk about enough in academia.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a big push for this like lone wolf genius figure</p>
<p>in academia, but that&rsquo;s certainly not been the case</p>
<p>in my life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had wonderful collaborators and people</p>
<p>that I work with along the team.</p>
<p>Also cross disciplinary.</p>
<p>Absolutely, yeah.</p>
<p>Cross disciplinary, interdisciplinary,</p>
<p>whatever you wanna call it, but.</p>
<p>Artists, where do artists come in?</p>
<p>Do you work with artists?</p>
<p>We do.</p>
<p>We have an arts curator</p>
<p>on the space exploration initiative side.</p>
<p>She helps make sure partly around that communication</p>
<p>challenge that we talked about,</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re not just doing zero G flights</p>
<p>and space missions, but that we take our artifacts</p>
<p>of this sci fi space future to museums</p>
<p>and galleries and exhibits.</p>
<p>She pushed me to make sure her name is Shinglu.</p>
<p>She pushed me for our first ISS mission.</p>
<p>I was just gathering all the engineering payloads</p>
<p>that I wanted to support for the students to fly,</p>
<p>including my own work.</p>
<p>And she said, you know what?</p>
<p>We should do an open call internationally</p>
<p>for artists to send something to the ISS.</p>
<p>And we found out it was the first time.</p>
<p>We were the first ever international open call</p>
<p>for art to go to the ISS.</p>
<p>And that was thanks to Shing, an artist bringing</p>
<p>a perspective that I might not have thought</p>
<p>about prioritizing, so.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s awesome.</p>
<p>So when you look out there,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the flame of human consciousness.</p>
<p>There does seem to be something quite special</p>
<p>about us humans.</p>
<p>Well, first of all, what do you think it is?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s consciousness?</p>
<p>What are we trying to preserve here?</p>
<p>What is it about humans that should be preserved</p>
<p>or life here on earth?</p>
<p>What gives you hope to try to expand it out</p>
<p>farther and farther?</p>
<p>Like, what makes you sad if it was all gone?</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;re a remarkable species</p>
<p>that we are aware of our own thoughts.</p>
<p>We are meta aware of our own thoughts</p>
<p>and of ourselves.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;re able to speak on a podcast</p>
<p>about our meta awareness, about our own thoughts.</p>
<p>About our own thoughts, yeah.</p>
<p>Turtles all the way down.</p>
<p>I think that that is a really special gift</p>
<p>that we have been given as a species</p>
<p>and that there&rsquo;s a worth to expanding</p>
<p>our circles of awareness.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re very aware of, as an earth based species,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve become a little bit more aware</p>
<p>of the fragility of earth and how special a place it is</p>
<p>when we go to the moon and we look back.</p>
<p>What would it mean for us to have a presence</p>
<p>and our purpose in life as a inter solar system species</p>
<p>or eventually an intergalactic species?</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a really profound opportunity</p>
<p>for exploration, for the sake of exploration.</p>
<p>A real gift for the human mind.</p>
<p>Yeah, for anything, we&rsquo;re curious creatures.</p>
<p>You see, you do believe we might one day</p>
<p>become intergalactic civilizations.</p>
<p>Long, long time from now.</p>
<p>We have a lot of propulsion challenges</p>
<p>to answer to get that far.</p>
<p>So you have a hope for this.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Another big ridiculous question building on top of that.</p>
<p>What do you think is the meaning of life?</p>
<p>This individual life of ours, your life,</p>
<p>that unfortunately has to come to an end</p>
<p>as far as we know for now.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And our life here together, is there a why?</p>
<p>Or do we just kinda like let our curiosity carry us away?</p>
<p>Oh, interesting.</p>
<p>Is there a single kind of driving purpose why</p>
<p>or can it just be curiosity based?</p>
<p>I certainly feel, and this is not the scientist</p>
<p>in me talking, but just more of like a human soul talking.</p>
<p>I certainly feel some sense of purpose</p>
<p>and meaning in my life.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a version of that</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a very local level within my family,</p>
<p>which is funny because this whole conversation</p>
<p>has been big, grand space exploration themes.</p>
<p>But you asked me this question</p>
<p>and my first thought is what really matters to me,</p>
<p>my family, my biological reproducing unit.</p>
<p>But then there&rsquo;s also another purpose,</p>
<p>like another version of the meaning in my life</p>
<p>that is trying to do good things for humanity.</p>
<p>So that sense that we can be individual humans</p>
<p>and have our local meaning,</p>
<p>and we can also be global humans.</p>
<p>Maybe someday like the Star Trek utopia</p>
<p>will all be global citizens.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna sound too naive.</p>
<p>But there is I think that beauty to a meaning</p>
<p>and a purpose of your life that&rsquo;s bigger than yourself,</p>
<p>working on something that&rsquo;s bigger and grander</p>
<p>than just yourself.</p>
<p>The deepest meaning is from</p>
<p>the local biological reproduction unit.</p>
<p>And then it goes to the engineering scientific,</p>
<p>what is it, corporate like company unit</p>
<p>that can actually produce and compete</p>
<p>and interact with the world.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s the giant human unit</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s struggling with pandemics.</p>
<p>And commons.</p>
<p>And together struggling against the forces of nature</p>
<p>that keeps wanting to kill us.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;d be nothing like an alien invasion</p>
<p>to unite the planet, we think.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t wait, bring it on aliens.</p>
<p>Listen, your work, you&rsquo;re an incredible communicator,</p>
<p>incredible young scientist there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s huge honor that you would spend your time with me.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t wait what you do in the future.</p>
<p>And thank you for representing MIT so beautifully,</p>
<p>so masterfully.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re an incredible person.</p>
<p>Thank you for talking to me.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for having me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been an absolute pleasure.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a great conversation.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to this conversation</p>
<p>with Ariel Ekblah.</p>
<p>To support this podcast,</p>
<p>please check out our sponsors in the description.</p>
<p>And now let me leave you with some words from Seneca,</p>
<p>the Roman stoic philosopher.</p>
<p>There is no easy way from earth to the stars.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.</p>
