<p>super electrolyte</p>

<p>pediatrician</p>
<p>well i think it&rsquo;s designed</p>
<p>for children when they get sick if they&rsquo;re dehydrated</p>
<p>because you want to make sure that they get enough</p>
<p>electrolytes</p>
<p>or fucks them up</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s plenty of kids out there</p>
<p>there are but</p>

<p>looks like you and half yeah</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>trick man it&rsquo;s a fucking</p>
<p>biological trick</p>
<p>but then you have one you go whoa</p>
<p>this is a different i</p>
<p>never considered</p>
<p>the amount of</p>
<p>responsibility and attachment and just the</p>
<p>biological attachment you have to him</p>
<p>oh no no i&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not saying that it is it isn&rsquo;t amazing</p>
<p>oh no i know you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>i know you&rsquo;re not but</p>
<p>a lot of times i say</p>
<p>things i say</p>
<p>things and they become misconstrued yeah</p>
<p>bill doesn&rsquo;t like that</p>
<p>slurping by the way is just for all you cunts</p>
<p>fucking getting angry that i slurp my coffee</p>
<p>i get all these people emailing me you</p>
<p>should stop drinking your coffee mute the</p>
<p>microphone while you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>drinking your coffee</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so disturbing</p>
<p>i can&rsquo;t enjoy your podcast i gotta</p>
<p>admit that&rsquo;s one of my pet peeves when i watch him</p>
<p>slurping i hate</p>
<p>if there&rsquo;s a scene where the actors are eating</p>
<p>i hit mute i can&rsquo;t listen to it because</p>
<p>they fucking you know actors they</p>
<p>gotta make it interesting they can&rsquo;t just eat they</p>
<p>gotta no listen</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna fucking</p>
<p>fucking rob the bank and they start</p>
<p>throwing shit in</p>
<p>their mouth and it drives me nuts just the sound</p>
<p>of somebody&rsquo;s the lip</p>
<p>smackers or what like</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re a car with a girl that you just got in a</p>
<p>fight with and she&rsquo;s eating</p>
<p>doritos you can just hear it like echoing off her</p>
<p>skull the crunching</p>
<p>noise you got issues this</p>
<p>motherfuckers</p>
<p>how he turned that into</p>
<p>some of his own shit yeah</p>
<p>he went to his own life</p>
<p>i have a fucking pet peeve it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>weird one but when i see someone eating in the movie</p>
<p>i secretly hope they had to do a hundred fucking takes</p>
<p>and they all threw up</p>
<p>like they can&rsquo;t keep eating</p>
<p>because it just seems so forced you know you&rsquo;re eating</p>
<p>while you&rsquo;re having</p>
<p>this conversation you know like what you&rsquo;re saying i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna rub his fucking bank</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s got a mouth of</p>
<p>it come on point with the</p>
<p>bread out what shit you</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t do it yeah</p>
<p>who the fuck is</p>
<p>pointing with</p>
<p>their sandwich</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d be like this guy is an asshole</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s pointing his fucking sandwich at me and</p>
<p>telling me what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to happen yeah</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s some</p>
<p>weird intimidation shit</p>
<p>you ever have someone fucking</p>
<p>talk to you and in the middle of the way talking to you</p>
<p>they put a hand on your knee</p>
<p>and squeeze your knee</p>
<p>while they&rsquo;re talking to you it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>what is happening here</p>
<p>i got a couple of</p>
<p>those i remember one time i did</p>
<p>i was shooting a pilot</p>
<p>for some show that</p>
<p>never got picked up and</p>
<p>it was hilarious because</p>
<p>what the hell happened basically</p>
<p>they wanted an edgy show</p>
<p>you know these</p>
<p>things always</p>
<p>start so we give them this edgy show</p>
<p>and right around</p>
<p>right before we did the run through the don</p>
<p>imus thing went down where he said nappy headed hose</p>
<p>so the industry gets so terrified</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not even just about radio now it becomes</p>
<p>about this friggin pilot</p>
<p>so they were already nervous</p>
<p>about the joke so we went in there and one of the</p>
<p>first jokes was</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know some homeless guy</p>
<p>comes up and asks</p>
<p>you know me for some change</p>
<p>you know on the liberal guy no no i don&rsquo;t want that the</p>
<p>other guy was a republican guy</p>
<p>and he turns around and he</p>
<p>flicks ice cream and hits him</p>
<p>right in the face was hilarious right</p>
<p>so they basically</p>
<p>they freaked out and then they didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>laugh at any jokes we&rsquo;re doing this run through</p>
<p>and dude i&rsquo;m telling you we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>absolutely bombing</p>
<p>okay now to me</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s hilarious</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not even that big a deal because</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve bombed horrifically by myself i&rsquo;m bombing with the</p>
<p>group it&rsquo;s funny</p>
<p>way easier yes i&rsquo;m walking into</p>
<p>scenes and the</p>
<p>other actors</p>
<p>i see the deer in the headlights i&rsquo;m almost laughing</p>
<p>and the more it bombs the harder i&rsquo;m committing to</p>
<p>these jokes</p>
<p>so anyway so the</p>
<p>whole thing tanks and by the end of it you</p>
<p>know me and the</p>
<p>other guy like dude i&rsquo;m getting</p>
<p>fired he&rsquo;s like no i&rsquo;m getting</p>
<p>fired so we</p>
<p>ended up going back to the hotel</p>
<p>and everybody shows up to talk</p>
<p>about it and</p>
<p>you know the creators of the show all come walking in</p>
<p>along with the director and i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>standing up i let</p>
<p>him in the room the fucking director comes walking in</p>
<p>sits down on my bed</p>
<p>and then reaches over i had some peanuts there</p>
<p>and just grabs a handful</p>
<p>and starts eating</p>
<p>and i just wanted to be like yeah dude</p>
<p>yeah make yourself at home have some fucking peanuts</p>
<p>but i was so in that i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna get fired</p>
<p>i was trying to be a nice guy and that&rsquo;s like one of</p>
<p>those things that&rsquo;s slowly killing me</p>
<p>is every once in a</p>
<p>while like you</p>
<p>know it was like years ago</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll be driving down the highway and i just</p>
<p>think of that</p>
<p>motherfucker</p>
<p>sitting down</p>
<p>eating my goddamn peanuts and i talked to you about it</p>
<p>and you were like dude that&rsquo;s like some</p>
<p>alpha male shit</p>
<p>dude he comes into your</p>
<p>place where</p>
<p>you live he</p>
<p>starts eating your food that is a weird</p>
<p>thing that people</p>
<p>do some people just open your refrigerator and</p>
<p>start eating</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t like that no that</p>
<p>drives me nuts</p>
<p>the only person i</p>
<p>might i don&rsquo;t mind it</p>
<p>is brian callan and joey</p>
<p>and joey always ask but</p>

<p>stuff like that</p>
<p>i&rsquo;d like a high school</p>
<p>teacher call me the dumbest kid in the room and i&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>still think about that</p>
<p>20 something</p>
<p>years ago i have the same</p>
<p>issue i talk</p>
<p>about it on</p>
<p>stage i reenact arguments from 1997</p>
<p>screaming at your windshield that&rsquo;s what i do no</p>
<p>let me tell you something math teacher</p>
<p>well i&rsquo;m glad that over all the years though</p>
<p>all the stupid ideas that i&rsquo;ve had</p>
<p>about arguments in my head i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>avoided all physical altercations</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve never had a physical altercation</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve had situations where</p>
<p>you know a long time ago</p>
<p>i wish i told this guy that or i wish i told him this</p>
<p>but the reality is</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s way better that i didn&rsquo;t because</p>
<p>then what if he went well fuck you and then he fucking</p>
<p>throws a rock at me and then all of a</p>
<p>sudden were</p>
<p>two men biting each other yeah</p>
<p>wrestling in the</p>
<p>street like fucking children</p>
<p>you know what the fuck is that</p>
<p>when i was a kid my</p>
<p>dad came home from work once with a fucking black eye</p>
<p>my stepdad&rsquo;s business was going</p>
<p>was falling</p>
<p>apart and at one</p>
<p>point shit got</p>
<p>squirrely and him and his partner fucking duked it out</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s crazy yeah even</p>
<p>youtube wasn&rsquo;t around then you know there&rsquo;d be</p>
<p>some sort of security i</p>
<p>was like whoa aren&rsquo;t you like in your fucking forties</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like what is happening it was</p>
<p>it was disappointing embarrassing it was sad it was a</p>
<p>bunch of different</p>
<p>things all at once you didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think it was badass on any</p>
<p>level that your stepdad</p>
<p>could still</p>
<p>throw it out</p>
<p>no he could i</p>
<p>think he got his ass kicked i&rsquo;m pretty sure</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s embarrassing i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>pretty sure he got sucker</p>
<p>punched and then</p>
<p>he hit the guy back he</p>
<p>punched the guy in the stomach but i don&rsquo;t know who</p>
<p>punched who</p>
<p>first but it&rsquo;s just fucking pathetic</p>
<p>this guy was his friend</p>
<p>and this guy used to come over the</p>
<p>house and we used to</p>
<p>you know we all thought</p>
<p>that have family dinners together like</p>
<p>him and his wife</p>
<p>would come over the house</p>
<p>this is my dad&rsquo;s partner</p>
<p>and then all of a</p>
<p>sudden they&rsquo;re fucking</p>
<p>duking it out at work as the business fell apart</p>
<p>it was very very</p>
<p>strange am i able</p>
<p>to come over for dinner</p>
<p>again or no</p>
<p>they became friends again yeah</p>
<p>they stayed friends you know they just</p>
<p>duked it out as friends and then they stayed friends</p>
<p>but it was just embarrassing</p>
<p>and he was embarrassed too he felt like such a fucking</p>
<p>idiot he came home with a black eye</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s like what am i doing that</p>
<p>would be hard for me</p>
<p>to re pick up the friendship</p>
<p>it&rsquo;d be easier if i won the fight</p>
<p>if i lost the fight that</p>
<p>would be in the back of my you want the rematch</p>
<p>at some point you get used to</p>
<p>when you do</p>
<p>jiu jitsu a lot you get used to getting beat</p>
<p>yeah but that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>different thing</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a different</p>
<p>thing you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going there you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>learning to</p>
<p>fight and then like hey</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s try these techniques</p>
<p>you know if like what if we had some big argument</p>
<p>about we were</p>
<p>gonna combine our podcasts</p>
<p>and then it</p>
<p>just didn&rsquo;t go well and i didn&rsquo;t give you the</p>
<p>money for the</p>
<p>microphones</p>
<p>and then we duked it out</p>
<p>and you somehow lost i somehow surprised you</p>
<p>and had a walk i</p>
<p>would feel like</p>
<p>one in a million chance i somehow caught you</p>
<p>i would feel way</p>
<p>stupider that we&rsquo;re fighting</p>
<p>i would feel way</p>
<p>stupider than that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>i know but you&rsquo;re a martial</p>
<p>artist i get it</p>
<p>right now just go in</p>
<p>peace you got dumped</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not even that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s always</p>
<p>you wouldn&rsquo;t see me in there</p>
<p>and like i got my back turned you down the i would</p>
<p>shake my head</p>
<p>a bit like what</p>
<p>bill how did i</p>
<p>punch me in the face with that</p>
<p>ron howard looking jackass</p>
<p>that would bug you</p>
<p>depends on if you really just tooled me up</p>
<p>like all of a</p>
<p>sudden you just fucking unload like</p>
<p>a 1 2 leg kick combination on me and drop</p>
<p>me i&rsquo;ve never</p>
<p>you hit me with a</p>
<p>liver shot and</p>
<p>drop me and then i had a tap out yeah then i&rsquo;d probably</p>
<p>want some sort of a rematch let me ask you this</p>
<p>would you be</p>
<p>really upset</p>
<p>would you lose a belt</p>
<p>class would you have to go back down to</p>
<p>brown belt and</p>
<p>purple belt</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t lose</p>
<p>i mean the only way look</p>
<p>you get the ideas that you&rsquo;re a certain</p>
<p>level of proficiency but it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t mean that someone can&rsquo;t get you</p>
<p>what if i started</p>
<p>flexing tapped all the</p>
<p>pictures of my face to your dojo</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no way</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d have to lose yourself</p>
<p>winner bilver</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s next and i&rsquo;m just sitting there with a</p>
<p>stupid look on my face oh</p>
<p>man you know</p>
<p>competition is healthy</p>
<p>i think it&rsquo;s fun</p>
<p>and everything but when it gets in the real world</p>
<p>like as far as like</p>
<p>fighting people and shit like that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s too squirrely because you don&rsquo;t just</p>
<p>fight someone</p>
<p>they get mad and then they come back and they want to</p>
<p>bring a baseball bat or fucking</p>
<p>stab you or</p>
<p>shoot you i</p>
<p>never fought outside my family past june</p>
<p>and i passed you in</p>
<p>junior high</p>
<p>oh yeah once kids</p>
<p>started getting to be like you know bucking a</p>
<p>quarter and knew how to</p>
<p>becoming coordinated</p>
<p>dude i saw one kid take a</p>
<p>pounding and i was just like yeah i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>sticking with the jokes</p>
<p>it was this kid who he was jacked he&rsquo;s one of</p>
<p>those man childs</p>
<p>in like eighth</p>
<p>grade you know</p>
<p>they could already</p>
<p>beat up the</p>
<p>teacher but then they get to high</p>
<p>school and they just stop growing and then</p>
<p>they just this little fire plug but in eighth grade</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s their peak</p>
<p>and this kid was at his apex of physical fitness</p>
<p>and he was fighting this doughy</p>
<p>this baby huey looking kid</p>
<p>and they go to get off the bus</p>
<p>and baby huey&rsquo;s behind man</p>
<p>child and he just you know</p>
<p>he just pushed him down from behind jumped got on his</p>
<p>chest and it was just he just</p>
<p>started teeing off on his head and it was one of those</p>
<p>you know when people go</p>
<p>crazy and then it becomes disgusting</p>
<p>like the crowd was just like ah</p>
<p>and it was just like he</p>
<p>was just beating the fuck out of him he didn&rsquo;t come to</p>
<p>school for the</p>
<p>rest of the week and he came back the next week and</p>
<p>his swelling in his face</p>
<p>had come down probably 80</p>
<p>but this is manchild manchild yeah manchild</p>
<p>still didn&rsquo;t look</p>
<p>and he had a look in his eye</p>
<p>i remember his</p>
<p>confidence was shaken</p>
<p>it was amazing man i was like you saw</p>
<p>it was a moment</p>
<p>in his life and i remember just looking at that</p>
<p>going yeah yeah def</p>
<p>it was funny</p>
<p>cause i almost went at it with that baby huey kid i</p>
<p>would have got</p>
<p>killed he&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>he just he would have</p>
<p>stabbed me with</p>
<p>the sounds of an</p>
<p>angry fucking kid</p>
<p>no he used to get</p>
<p>bullied and he just i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>he was used to getting</p>
<p>the crap kicked out of him by people like</p>
<p>two years older</p>
<p>which is basically when you&rsquo;re in seventh</p>
<p>grade like that two years</p>
<p>it is a huge jump physically</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re sitting there you know</p>
<p>like okay i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna fight you</p>
<p>and the other guys like we got like a beard you know</p>
<p>just smashing you over the head so um</p>
<p>yeah so all my</p>
<p>fights were</p>
<p>basically within my family</p>
<p>and i had four brothers so i used to practice on my</p>
<p>three younger ones</p>
<p>and then try to take my</p>
<p>older brother who had the</p>
<p>psychological advantage over me so</p>
<p>older brothers always have an advantage yeah</p>
<p>i didn&rsquo;t beat i had a friend whose</p>
<p>older brother used to beat the fuck out of him</p>
<p>and it tortured him</p>
<p>late into like</p>
<p>adulthood he was in his late 30s and it was</p>
<p>fucked it fucked his head up</p>
<p>he always wanted to get back at his brother</p>
<p>he used to go over his brother&rsquo;s</p>
<p>house and his brother was at home and</p>
<p>steal shit from him</p>
<p>like he would go like</p>
<p>his brother&rsquo;s wife was there</p>
<p>he&rsquo;d say hi hey gam</p>
<p>i got john told me to go pick something up and he</p>
<p>would go in and just</p>
<p>steal from his brother what&rsquo;s that</p>
<p>from brotherly</p>
<p>brother beat</p>
<p>the fuck out of them his brother beat the</p>
<p>fuck out of them my brother was like two years older</p>
<p>and just used to</p>
<p>just box them up used to fucking</p>
<p>really hurt him</p>
<p>and intimidate the shit out of him i got one for you i</p>
<p>went last time i fought my youngest brother</p>
<p>i forget what we went at it</p>
<p>about my dad came in to</p>
<p>break it up</p>
<p>and like a piece of shit i did one more over my dad</p>
<p>shoulder caught him and it made that</p>
<p>classic like hollywood</p>
<p>should have recorded the sound</p>
<p>for like the</p>
<p>punch in the face was that classic</p>
<p>but like with a little bit of lip</p>
<p>sound caught</p>
<p>him right in the mouth and</p>
<p>i knew it bugged him and then what</p>
<p>would hit for like 15 years we</p>
<p>would be out</p>
<p>drinking and like when he got on his</p>
<p>third drink</p>
<p>i would feel him</p>
<p>sizing me up i felt it</p>
<p>i felt it i was just</p>
<p>going is this in my head or is this dude</p>
<p>sizing me up</p>
<p>and then like years</p>
<p>later i&rsquo;m drinking with my</p>
<p>other brother</p>
<p>and we were talking</p>
<p>about our mom</p>
<p>going yeah he</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t think i noticed but i feel him</p>
<p>sizing up he goes</p>
<p>oh yeah dude he goes</p>
<p>every time i</p>
<p>drink with him he</p>
<p>brings that up</p>
<p>and like by then he was a little bit taller than me</p>
<p>and he had that</p>
<p>anger and stuff but</p>
<p>i just would have just tied them up</p>
<p>like i got to a</p>
<p>point where i just you</p>
<p>know you got a strategy</p>
<p>planned out in your head</p>
<p>duck under the sucker</p>
<p>punch get the clinch</p>
<p>yeah my older brother came at me</p>
<p>about 11 years ago like a red roof in</p>
<p>some sort of bullshit</p>
<p>and he came</p>
<p>flying at me</p>
<p>you know my brother&rsquo;s no joke he can</p>
<p>fight and i just tied him up</p>
<p>but i had the advantage</p>
<p>where he has a real job so he has to work</p>
<p>i can sit here going on hikes and going to the gym and</p>
<p>stuff so i was in</p>
<p>cardio i was in better shape so</p>
<p>i just tied him up</p>
<p>hello jeff tie him up for</p>
<p>not not long dude he was like on these paths</p>
<p>fifteen seconds it was like in cubicle shape</p>
<p>like that initial</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m gonna i&rsquo;m gonna kill you but this is the</p>
<p>thing though if he would have</p>
<p>if i didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>tie him up yeah that&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>i did it&rsquo;s like in hockey when when someone does not</p>
<p>fight they just grab the guy and like bear hug him</p>
<p>i just sort of</p>
<p>did that and i was</p>
<p>how was it he was</p>
<p>kinda on top of me but</p>
<p>i just had him sort of</p>
<p>smothered in there i was like dude i&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>gonna fight i&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>gonna fight he didn&rsquo;t talk to me for a year</p>
<p>wow he didn&rsquo;t talk to me for a year</p>
<p>and what was he mad about</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t it was dude it&rsquo;s that</p>
<p>family shit</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>something from 1974 i&rsquo;m glad i don&rsquo;t have brothers</p>
<p>cause i would not</p>
<p>wanna grow up with someone like me</p>
<p>if i was a brother</p>
<p>if i&rsquo;d have like</p>
<p>one of two things</p>
<p>would happen</p>
<p>either we would</p>
<p>join an alliance</p>
<p>you know and fucking</p>
<p>start a team take on the</p>
<p>world and tag team</p>
<p>chicks or we</p>
<p>would fight to the</p>
<p>death it&rsquo;s gonna be one or the other</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t really see any</p>
<p>other options yeah</p>
<p>so which one&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be fucker</p>
<p>yeah i know i</p>
<p>think there&rsquo;s a reason why you didn&rsquo;t have a brother</p>
<p>because whenever i talk</p>
<p>to him he is like you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>have a couple of parakeets and they somehow have a</p>
<p>fight to the death</p>
<p>like dude i don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s with parakeets</p>
<p>they just go attitude it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re way more mellow</p>
<p>when i met you</p>
<p>in the 90s dude this guy was like in game</p>
<p>seven energy</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so funny</p>
<p>everyone keeps on saying that yeah</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the theme way</p>
<p>way more mellow</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the theme i</p>
<p>think we&rsquo;re just now feel comfortable to tell him now</p>
<p>is that what it is no</p>
<p>no no you&rsquo;re now so</p>
<p>mellow we could talk</p>
<p>about it no but i was way more angrier</p>
<p>when i met him</p>
<p>you know what i mean it&rsquo;s one of</p>
<p>those things</p>
<p>where you yeah</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re your</p>
<p>thing yeah your</p>
<p>20s you&rsquo;re processing</p>
<p>what the fuck just happened to you in your</p>
<p>first 20 hopefully you had a good</p>
<p>childhood if you didn&rsquo;t you end up in show business</p>
<p>or whatever and then you know you kind of you think</p>
<p>back to that</p>
<p>stuff so yeah you know</p>
<p>yeah i&rsquo;m kind of just realizing</p>
<p>how how much of a difference</p>
<p>it must be for people because so many fucking people</p>
<p>bring it up</p>
<p>and i try to</p>
<p>think like what</p>
<p>the fuck i was like when i was younger then</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t think i was a douchebag</p>
<p>but i definitely</p>
<p>think i had douchebag tendencies</p>
<p>you know like if you were a douchebag to me i</p>
<p>could just go full douche</p>
<p>right back at you and get</p>
<p>stuck in some stupid ass</p>
<p>douchey argument no i</p>
<p>just got really rational i</p>
<p>shouldn&rsquo;t have been caught into it you like your energy</p>
<p>man you were on the balls of your feet you fucking</p>
<p>ready it was like</p>
<p>your energy was like you had just gotten into a</p>
<p>fight well you met me i was only i just</p>
<p>probably what</p>
<p>would you i met</p>
<p>when i 96 96</p>
<p>well that&rsquo;s a lot of years</p>
<p>later i was</p>
<p>thinking he probably met me</p>
<p>earlier in the 90s when</p>
<p>my last fight i</p>
<p>think was like an 89</p>
<p>it took a while for me to just wind</p>
<p>down as a human being from that</p>
<p>just from the idea of competing</p>
<p>cause most of my life from fifteen to</p>
<p>twenty one was just competing</p>
<p>in martial arts tournaments that&rsquo;s all i did yeah you</p>
<p>would like a retired athlete</p>
<p>and now you just you know</p>
<p>twenty one you know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all the</p>
<p>sudden i&rsquo;m trying to do comedy and i</p>
<p>still have this</p>
<p>fucking weird</p>
<p>mind you know that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>tuned in for</p>
<p>physical and</p>
<p>combat you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>still in bloodsport</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so stupid when i look back and</p>
<p>think back what i</p>
<p>have done that now there&rsquo;s no fucking way i&rsquo;m not gonna</p>
<p>fight somebody for free</p>
<p>and and dedicate my</p>
<p>whole life to doing this</p>
<p>traveling around</p>
<p>the country and kicking people in the head</p>
<p>like that&rsquo;s what i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna do they</p>
<p>gonna kick me</p>
<p>travel no nobody</p>
<p>covered shit</p>
<p>you had to pay for your own</p>
<p>travel everywhere you had to pay for your own</p>
<p>hotel room we</p>
<p>sleep like a</p>
<p>bunch of people in a hotel room</p>
<p>like one of us will</p>
<p>sleep on the</p>
<p>floor one guy would</p>
<p>sleep in one bed one guy</p>
<p>would sleep in another bed</p>
<p>one guy would</p>
<p>sleep in a tub</p>
<p>we slept a bunch of guys in rooms</p>
<p>yeah everyone was broke</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re all</p>
<p>fighting full contact</p>
<p>with no fucking no</p>
<p>protection i mean</p>
<p>you you have like this little</p>
<p>chest protector on your body</p>
<p>but the really</p>
<p>scary thing</p>
<p>the really scary</p>
<p>thing is your feet</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>punches and it&rsquo;s kicking someone in the head it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>scary shit so</p>
<p>after a while</p>
<p>exactly do you what</p>
<p>part of your foot do you use so it hurts the less the</p>
<p>least well you just get used to kick</p>
<p>your head is</p>
<p>gonna hurt a lot more than my foot is</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;ll hurt i got broken my</p>
<p>foot on people&rsquo;s shins and i&rsquo;m broken my foot on elbows</p>
<p>but your your</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like between like kicking someone in the head it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t really hurt your foot</p>
<p>they just go</p>
<p>out family guy mode</p>
<p>going ah kicking</p>
<p>someone and it</p>
<p>would be over</p>
<p>if you catch him with the toes you see that a lot in</p>
<p>fights like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s more of a slap</p>
<p>but if somebody like</p>
<p>solidly kicks you in the head</p>
<p>man god if you do it</p>
<p>right almost everybody goes out</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s one of</p>
<p>my favorite</p>
<p>things i watch those</p>
<p>boss root videos</p>
<p>where he just</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know like</p>
<p>watching that guy like he was so</p>
<p>people were so afraid of that</p>
<p>liver shot oh yeah is that</p>
<p>that richard</p>
<p>prior bit remember that bit</p>
<p>where he talked</p>
<p>about how he came out with his hands high and the guy</p>
<p>all down and then the next</p>
<p>round he comes out he&rsquo;s got his</p>
<p>elbows down by his waist</p>
<p>and then they&rsquo;re doing this like</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know i watch his</p>
<p>videos and it&rsquo;s like this amazing like information</p>
<p>and then just</p>
<p>completely collect</p>
<p>like the guys</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s great we had one the podcast</p>
<p>i saw that you had that</p>
<p>yeah listen to a young</p>
<p>guy is fucking</p>
<p>killing machine and he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>absolutely hilarious did you see that one</p>
<p>where he goes like</p>
<p>he walks in if you see somebody yeah fuck your wife</p>
<p>i give him the gun and then i take out the nine</p>
<p>it just yeah he&rsquo;s fucking crazy</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s crazy he</p>
<p>did the fighting days that he did he did the bare</p>
<p>knuckle pancreas</p>
<p>days you weren&rsquo;t allowed to</p>
<p>punch to the face</p>
<p>but you were allowed to</p>
<p>punch the body and you can open palm slap each</p>
<p>other in the face</p>
<p>just so much more humiliating yeah i</p>
<p>guess well he</p>
<p>knocked guys out like that he&rsquo;s such a savage</p>
<p>he figured out if you just pull your hand way back and</p>
<p>throw it like a</p>
<p>punch and use the palm of your fist</p>
<p>instead of slapping them and hitting him with the hand</p>
<p>which is kind of flexible it gives into the shot</p>
<p>if you hit him with the palm</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s a bone</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s a bone that you really don&rsquo;t have to</p>
<p>worry about</p>
<p>breaking unlike your hands</p>
<p>how can you</p>
<p>punch somebody in the face bare</p>
<p>knuckle you really have to</p>
<p>worry about</p>
<p>breaking your hands</p>
<p>people don&rsquo;t realize that a lot of people</p>
<p>break hands no i&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>stab smash bang bang goodbye</p>
<p>and you know what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>funny is that</p>
<p>sound effect is so</p>
<p>funny but you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>watching him his form</p>
<p>is perfect yeah oh</p>
<p>yeah he&rsquo;s got some fucking</p>
<p>great stories</p>
<p>about brawls to</p>
<p>you know imagine picking a</p>
<p>fight with that fucking guy what</p>
<p>a what a giant</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t take a mistake</p>
<p>apparently there was some football player that got</p>
<p>mouthy with him</p>
<p>boss accidentally stepped on the guy&rsquo;s foot</p>
<p>and the guy got you know</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a little animated</p>

<p>guess he was just really loud and he&rsquo;s fun guy you know</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s telling some</p>
<p>story or something he stepped on this guy&rsquo;s foot</p>

<p>and then his friends come</p>
<p>up to him goes do you know what the fuck you&rsquo;re doing</p>

<p>who thought i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna go outside and fuck up this bald guy</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s what a</p>
<p>giant mistake</p>
<p>yeah but this guy&rsquo;s way bigger</p>
<p>this guy&rsquo;s a football</p>
<p>i mean football players man</p>
<p>i was in phoenix once i was in tamping i was</p>
<p>going to the improv</p>

<p>one of the arizona</p>
<p>state guys who&rsquo;s</p>
<p>playing like professional football now</p>
<p>he was so big</p>
<p>right like you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t realize like how big that kind of big is</p>
<p>that boss root</p>
<p>is only 215 pounds</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s nothing compared to</p>
<p>these guys i was</p>
<p>in a bar in utah and there was a guy who used to play</p>
<p>quarterback for like oregon or oregon state</p>
<p>and i was just looking at the guy</p>
<p>going that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>quarterback</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s because they look</p>
<p>like rag dolls when they get hit on tv this guy was</p>
<p>he was like 6 5</p>
<p>like 240 and he was</p>
<p>still in shape and it&rsquo;s like that guy</p>
<p>you know if a linebacker comes from behind he</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t see him his</p>
<p>head snaps back and he&rsquo;s on the ground like all woozy</p>

<p>yeah yeah that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a pay</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a wig</p>
<p>whatever he&rsquo;s cool as fuck i let him get away with it</p>
<p>those old guys like you</p>
<p>ever see like humphrey bogart&rsquo;s wig that needs to wear</p>
<p>back in the</p>
<p>day oh yeah</p>
<p>oh yeah pretty obvious one</p>
<p>yeah i&rsquo;m free bogart was</p>
<p>going bald as he was a</p>
<p>movie star so they got him a fucking wig frankly</p>
<p>jesus christ you know so i have</p>
<p>watched a bunch of his movies man</p>
<p>comfort road</p>
<p>right i saw a lot of</p>
<p>frank sinatra and i know</p>
<p>frank liked him</p>
<p>frank took a lot of his swagger from that guy</p>
<p>really yeah</p>
<p>yeah if you watch</p>
<p>those movies yeah yeah he&rsquo;s got a couple</p>
<p>man he&rsquo;s got one i&rsquo;m so bad at remembering the names of</p>
<p>movies he&rsquo;s got one</p>
<p>where he calls this girl out</p>
<p>on some female shit that like you know</p>
<p>i saw and i was like that shit happened to me last week</p>
<p>he just totally calls her out we</p>
<p>should try to change the subject</p>
<p>about something and</p>
<p>it was just it was awesome</p>
<p>say that&rsquo;s not what we were talking</p>
<p>about no but he</p>
<p>was like the</p>
<p>story he had that he didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know that was</p>
<p>more like edward g</p>
<p>robinson yeah</p>
<p>yeah shitty accent</p>
<p>so what it was like</p>
<p>no he&rsquo;s here just more i can&rsquo;t do an</p>
<p>impression of</p>
<p>the guy but he had just more of a laid back</p>
<p>he just would</p>
<p>he just would be sitting in a</p>
<p>scene looking</p>
<p>at you and you just immediately felt like ah shit</p>
<p>you remember</p>
<p>those old movies</p>
<p>where the guy</p>
<p>would get mad and he</p>
<p>would fucking</p>
<p>smack the check</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s what they used to do</p>
<p>i think they did it on archie bonker didn&rsquo;t they they</p>
<p>would never</p>
<p>consider oh</p>
<p>archie didn&rsquo;t archie hit either</p>
<p>she got really mad at him i</p>
<p>think so oh watch</p>
<p>remember and everybody was really upset</p>
<p>remember that shit i just sort</p>
<p>of vaguely remember this</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not making this up i</p>
<p>think i think i remember that too</p>
<p>i think there was</p>
<p>so long ago that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>tricky memory wanted it to happen you know your whole</p>
<p>every cell in your body</p>
<p>except your neurons</p>
<p>gets replaced every seven years</p>
<p>so your memory where the fuck is your memory</p>
<p>store does it in your brain is it in your neurons is it</p>
<p>non local nobody really knows</p>
<p>so when you</p>
<p>look back in a memory that you had from like</p>
<p>twenty years ago</p>
<p>who knows what the fuck whether</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve made that up on the</p>
<p>story of a memory that you used to remember</p>
<p>you created something new</p>
<p>you know who the no no</p>
<p>i know what you&rsquo;re saying because</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve listened to guys tell stories</p>
<p>about stuff</p>
<p>where i was</p>
<p>there and i was just like i don&rsquo;t remember like yeah</p>
<p>well then it was a</p>
<p>sailboat remember the guy in the sale what</p>
<p>you know we were in our living room</p>
<p>talking about</p>
<p>no bro we just won the lottery you don&rsquo;t remember</p>
<p>i just came back from a banning on you stream</p>
<p>i was banned yesterday for</p>
<p>showing a thong</p>
<p>showing a thong yeah what</p>
<p>yeah this girl</p>
<p>we had on peaches</p>
<p>and we also had the holly first of all what</p>
<p>did you say her name was</p>
<p>peaches i know one peaches that it was</p>
<p>her real name she was a wardrobe person on fear factor</p>
<p>very nice lady right</p>
<p>that was a real name</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s this girl&rsquo;s real name</p>
<p>this girl&rsquo;s</p>
<p>sarah peaches</p>
<p>and the reason we were asking why she was called</p>
<p>peaches because her butt</p>
<p>looks like a peach</p>
<p>and so we&rsquo;re like oh we</p>
<p>gotta see this butt now so she pulled down her</p>
<p>pants and she had a thong on</p>
<p>and i guess people complained and they just banned my</p>
<p>whole account but</p>
<p>but i thought that</p>
<p>ustream just hooked you up and just said that you were</p>
<p>gonna get oh yeah yeah yeah but</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a difference between</p>
<p>like you know</p>
<p>standards and practices exactly</p>
<p>so did you contact the guy i contacted</p>
<p>him they you know pulled the</p>
<p>video and then put me</p>
<p>back up and they&rsquo;re just saying that you know nowadays</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s kind of like a network tv they have sponsors</p>
<p>you know you can&rsquo;t have yeah but you</p>
<p>can show a thong</p>
<p>but anyway that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what i thought i was like thongs though are like</p>
<p>you can go on the</p>
<p>beach with a thong</p>
<p>right right</p>
<p>yeah it all depends</p>
<p>it all depends</p>
<p>on what tv show</p>
<p>like country music</p>
<p>right network</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m sure like you couldn&rsquo;t show a thong on that</p>
<p>yeah yeah yeah</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s certainly</p>
<p>broadcast network so i</p>
<p>guess you know it&rsquo;s all new</p>
<p>top technology it&rsquo;s all new</p>
<p>shit so kind of have to find that yeah but what about</p>
<p>the shit we talk about</p>
<p>what we talk</p>
<p>about is a fucking thousand times more offensive</p>
<p>than a girl absolutely</p>
<p>absolutely you know a thong that&rsquo;s it really</p>
<p>yeah so fucking</p>
<p>weird like what you were saying</p>
<p>about that you know</p>
<p>the situation</p>
<p>that happened when you were doing that show and</p>
<p>you know people</p>
<p>get offended and what was the one what was the</p>
<p>story that was in the news</p>
<p>while you were doing the show don</p>
<p>imas the don imas</p>
<p>story what you</p>
<p>call the girl</p>
<p>snappy headed hose</p>
<p>when i was doing the man show it was</p>
<p>janet jackson&rsquo;s nipple</p>
<p>janet jackson&rsquo;s nipple in the super bowl</p>
<p>came out right</p>
<p>while we were doing the man show</p>
<p>and i thought</p>
<p>who gives a what the fuck it&rsquo;s nothing you know it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>stupid stunt</p>
<p>you know but</p>
<p>who cares really</p>
<p>i mean to me it was a non issue</p>
<p>but it became this fucking huge</p>
<p>thing in show business</p>
<p>where you could i mean</p>
<p>they came in and</p>
<p>changed monologues they came in and cut out</p>
<p>scenes they cut out</p>
<p>cut out sketches</p>
<p>they were like no more we can&rsquo;t we can&rsquo;t do this we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna have to take this way back yeah i wish i</p>
<p>could be on the phone call</p>
<p>when it comes from</p>
<p>whatever group</p>
<p>or washington dc when they say that i</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s because that they actually take it seriously</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s just so</p>
<p>disappointing though when you see all</p>
<p>these fucking people scrambled because some</p>
<p>chick pulled out her nipple</p>
<p>and the crazy</p>
<p>thing was the news the big</p>
<p>thing in the paper said</p>
<p>that it was during the dinner hour</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what it said</p>
<p>no no no no</p>
<p>no i totally a</p>
<p>black tit during the</p>
<p>no people were</p>
<p>right to be offended it was on network</p>
<p>television all</p>
<p>right it was the</p>
<p>super bowl you got your kids</p>
<p>watching i understood</p>
<p>what kind of</p>
<p>kids are you raising that are gonna be</p>
<p>freaking out</p>
<p>about a chick&rsquo;s nipple</p>
<p>serious yeah</p>
<p>no wait no wait a</p>
<p>minute wait a</p>
<p>minute you still want your kids to have a</p>
<p>childhood that&rsquo;s what i</p>
<p>think awful</p>
<p>about nipples a goddamn</p>
<p>childhood stealing</p>
<p>months yeah</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a little bit of</p>
<p>excitement in their</p>
<p>childhoods not like fucking janet jackson</p>
<p>started stroking</p>
<p>the nipple and then fingering her i&rsquo;ll tell you what</p>
<p>whip out a black</p>
<p>tit in front of my kids they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna start</p>
<p>laughing at you yeah i</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s funny</p>
<p>well listen</p>
<p>okay there&rsquo;s people out there</p>
<p>they have how they want to</p>
<p>raise their kids so</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like they don&rsquo;t have cable</p>
<p>so keep all the</p>
<p>smut on cable and i</p>
<p>should be able to be here so that</p>
<p>thing crossed in</p>
<p>you know what i compared it to</p>
<p>it was like</p>
<p>orange juice and</p>
<p>brushing your</p>
<p>teeth individually they were fine</p>
<p>but you bring them together it&rsquo;s bad there&rsquo;s nothing</p>
<p>wrong with seeing an</p>
<p>iconic it&rsquo;s a very</p>
<p>good point and iconic titty</p>
<p>but you had it on network tv</p>
<p>and that was that was the</p>
<p>problem so like that&rsquo;s an interesting way to look at it</p>
<p>i think we&rsquo;re way too hung up</p>
<p>about sex though i</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s a non</p>
<p>issue i really do it&rsquo;s not like they were fucking on tv</p>
<p>she pulled out her</p>
<p>pussy and fingered herself in</p>
<p>front of the camera</p>
<p>i&rsquo;d go yeah you just went too far now you&rsquo;re all sexual</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a football game yeah but they&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>some sexual</p>
<p>performance on network</p>
<p>television yeah but</p>
<p>every time you</p>
<p>watch dancing with the stars they&rsquo;re fucking on the</p>
<p>stage i mean</p>
<p>they lumbot each</p>
<p>other and when the</p>
<p>woman will straddle the guy&rsquo;s cock what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on there</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re imitating some sort</p>
<p>of sexuality yeah</p>
<p>but this is the thing</p>
<p>you you know that</p>
<p>okay it&rsquo;s a football game the kid</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t know that</p>
<p>no what i&rsquo;m saying is as a parent</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;ve decided to</p>
<p>watch dancing with the stars no if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna watch a football game you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>expecting to see a titty</p>
<p>so you just</p>
<p>expect to see dudes that weigh 300</p>
<p>pounds and jacked up with antivar</p>
<p>and human growth hormone</p>
<p>running at each</p>
<p>other and smashing into each other</p>
<p>and somehow another</p>
<p>tit is scarier than that</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not saying i have a</p>
<p>problem with it i&rsquo;m saying look you have to understand</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not either i&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a fake argument bro</p>
<p>just try to keep this</p>
<p>going alright people&rsquo;s</p>
<p>point of view</p>
<p>well fucking roll with it like you just say</p>
<p>that people&rsquo;s fucking like</p>
<p>just like you got to respect that</p>
<p>other people don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>aren&rsquo;t you know i had i told i totally</p>
<p>freaked out by shit they go look i want my kid to</p>
<p>have like dude you know something even if it was like</p>
<p>one second listen</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t even know</p>
<p>what a pussy look like</p>
<p>until i was like what like twelve</p>
<p>should grow up with me you know</p>
<p>i showed you</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about intercity</p>
<p>kids i&rsquo;m just saying i was allowed to have a fucking</p>
<p>childhood and be innocent for a little bit but like</p>
<p>now it&rsquo;s just like</p>
<p>the shit that you can get away with</p>
<p>on like network tv now because of cable</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s fucking i remember</p>
<p>like when the benny hill show came out people were</p>
<p>freaking out</p>
<p>and all he was doing</p>
<p>he was walking up behind girls</p>
<p>asses pretending he was warming his hands</p>
<p>and he had that</p>
<p>silly and way in</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s walking in fast motion</p>
<p>and they were</p>
<p>freaking out and i sat there</p>
<p>as like a fucking like</p>
<p>seven year old</p>
<p>turned on by it because that that was like tube 8</p>
<p>was the benny hill show back then</p>
<p>and i think that like seriously i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>that i think kids do see way too much</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t think they</p>
<p>should be embarrassed</p>
<p>about bodies and</p>
<p>stuff like that but i mean</p>
<p>dude that you</p>
<p>understand they can go into your laptop</p>
<p>and like we didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>we couldn&rsquo;t you couldn&rsquo;t see any like like a porno</p>
<p>when we were coming up</p>
<p>you&rsquo;d have to have a fucking know how to work a real to</p>
<p>real and then</p>
<p>vcr and then you&rsquo;d have to find your</p>
<p>parents stash now you can just go on the damn laptop</p>
<p>i really sound like some</p>
<p>right no but you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>right you&rsquo;re right</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m just saying</p>
<p>everything you</p>
<p>want to raise</p>
<p>their kids the way they want to</p>
<p>raise them so</p>
<p>if you chose not to have cable</p>
<p>and you want to stay away from that shit then it&rsquo;s fine</p>
<p>i see what you&rsquo;re saying but the way i look at is</p>
<p>everything accelerates including access to</p>
<p>things access to information access to even bad</p>
<p>things and you</p>
<p>know the kids are</p>
<p>gonna have to deal with an ever</p>
<p>changing world</p>
<p>and if you went from</p>
<p>where you were when you were 12 to how you see the</p>
<p>world now it&rsquo;d be a pretty big fucking</p>
<p>shock you know</p>
<p>and i think</p>
<p>for kids it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna get it way</p>
<p>earlier than we did</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s just the nature of the</p>
<p>world today it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t fight</p>
<p>against that i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s kind of like how the internet</p>
<p>started off with such slow</p>
<p>speeds like you have</p>
<p>56k mode and</p>
<p>for and used</p>
<p>to be like hey what&rsquo;s this</p>
<p>photo oh hey oh that&rsquo;s a horse a</p>
<p>stick oh my god it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going in that person&rsquo;s ass</p>
<p>you know you kind of were deluded to the internet</p>
<p>because you did this slowly</p>
<p>it was a slow process of seeing</p>
<p>all that root on the internet</p>
<p>what where people</p>
<p>watch that type of shit or they</p>
<p>watch like beheadings</p>
<p>oh no no i mean i&rsquo;m talking about</p>
<p>sending you</p>
<p>things no because</p>
<p>you know the only</p>
<p>thing that&rsquo;s really fucked up there&rsquo;s a lot of people</p>
<p>who aren&rsquo;t on the vice</p>
<p>squad but have like that</p>
<p>level of mental damage and they&rsquo;re like an account</p>
<p>because they go on</p>
<p>and watch somebody get</p>
<p>their head sought off yeah</p>
<p>i remember that</p>
<p>video in like</p>
<p>comics coming and going yeah</p>
<p>dude i shouldn&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>watched it like</p>
<p>you saw like</p>
<p>i got a bit my act</p>
<p>where i talk</p>
<p>about your soul i view it like it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>pixelated and</p>
<p>every time you see something that you shouldn&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>seen like a couple of cubes float away</p>
<p>and you just</p>
<p>never the same person so i i think</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m trying to i</p>
<p>think you stop</p>
<p>watching porn in</p>
<p>spite of all that</p>
<p>yeah yeah i</p>
<p>tried to do that when i</p>
<p>started having kids</p>
<p>but stop watching porn</p>
<p>you start thinking</p>
<p>about those kids right</p>
<p>you know what stars</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s like a tipping point</p>
<p>yeah there&rsquo;s a tipping</p>
<p>point with this shit</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s kind of like all</p>
<p>right this is healthy</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re exploring what you&rsquo;re into</p>
<p>and then you just go down a</p>
<p>rabbit hole</p>
<p>you closes behind you</p>
<p>and easily you can easily go down</p>
<p>how many guys do we know</p>
<p>that have been addicted to masturbating when they talk</p>
<p>about they&rsquo;ve masturbated</p>
<p>three times a day</p>
<p>every day even if they&rsquo;re not hard</p>
<p>you know they just keep going</p>
<p>what i mean</p>
<p>you give a guy a lot of free time</p>
<p>this shag rug here</p>
<p>you give guys enough free time they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna jerk off just a fact</p>
<p>they do it in prison even though they</p>

<p>they don&rsquo;t care</p>
<p>these guys in solitary confinement</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re naked beating off</p>

<p>sarah peaches</p>
<p>the guy that came with her was the</p>
<p>hollywood sex</p>
<p>like anyone that has a sex tape</p>

<p>about how no she was behind it she made</p>
<p>about seven million dollars from that shit</p>

<p>of her getting fisted i believe oh my goodness and</p>

<p>around the industry and that was the end of her career</p>
<p>wow yeah you</p>

<p>minute usher&rsquo;s gay</p>
<p>wait a minute</p>
<p>you know what peg means</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>assuming in the butt it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>where a girl wears a</p>
<p>dildo and fucks you in the ass</p>
<p>what listen to the podcast it&rsquo;s crazy</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s naughty show number 12 that guy&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna get sued yeah you just say</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t say</p>
<p>he said it i didn&rsquo;t say it</p>
<p>alright i will</p>
<p>say allegedly but that&rsquo;s what he said</p>
<p>funny that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>so common that guys like girls fuck em with</p>
<p>strap ons they have a nickname for it</p>
<p>pegged and everybody&rsquo;s like oh yeah i heard</p>
<p>of that before oh yeah</p>
<p>oh i&rsquo;m well</p>
<p>aware of what that entails</p>
<p>what a fucking</p>
<p>crazy business</p>
<p>this guy that i know</p>
<p>his buddy was dating a porn star and</p>
<p>he was dealing with it for a</p>
<p>while because he was kind of a</p>
<p>loser he didn&rsquo;t have a job and</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t really have much going on she would</p>
<p>pay for dinner and</p>
<p>stuff like that and you know</p>
<p>he just said ah just work for her it&rsquo;s work for her</p>
<p>just work one day</p>
<p>he comes home and she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going over her contract for the next thing</p>
<p>and he goes what does</p>
<p>airtight mean</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>in one of the descriptions of the</p>
<p>scenes it means a dick in every hole</p>
<p>and she goes one in my</p>
<p>mouth one in my butt and one in my pussy</p>
<p>goes that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>hilarious that&rsquo;s hilarious he goes</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s it i&rsquo;m out you got up that was the end of the</p>
<p>relationship you packed up your shit and you moved out</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like i&rsquo;m done</p>
<p>what airtight</p>
<p>like this bitch wasn&rsquo;t just doing porn</p>
<p>you know he</p>
<p>tried to distance himself and not</p>
<p>watch any of it</p>
<p>you know he&rsquo;s kind of a</p>
<p>liberal fella</p>
<p>you know try</p>
<p>to be creative man air tight i like this</p>
<p>but it was just</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so common</p>
<p>that girls know</p>
<p>what it means when it&rsquo;s in your contract</p>
<p>you have to do one air tight you know one clean</p>
<p>i still think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>funny that they</p>
<p>still have to come up with</p>
<p>these euphemisms</p>
<p>because even with them they</p>
<p>try to make it okay so you know we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna you know</p>
<p>start off with the</p>
<p>standard we&rsquo;ll do</p>
<p>blah blah blah we&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>build to an airtight and then</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll do a facial</p>
<p>it sounds like a spa</p>
<p>well some of them</p>
<p>some of them are so common that it&rsquo;s actually with the</p>
<p>search terms like cream pie</p>
<p>cream pie is you</p>
<p>shoot a load inside a girl and then she kind of</p>
<p>squirts it out like a like a</p>
<p>cream pie i&rsquo;m familiar with the point</p>
<p>yeah but i mean what the fuck</p>

<p>the day you get</p>
<p>what year did you take an aids test</p>
<p>the first year i took one was 96 or seven</p>
<p>and i remember i</p>
<p>had to wait like five six days</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s one thing walking about</p>
<p>walking around</p>
<p>worrying because they had everybody</p>
<p>worried that they had it so</p>
<p>worrying that you had it</p>
<p>was something you give</p>
<p>you know but</p>
<p>knowing that you were</p>
<p>gonna find out</p>
<p>emphatically</p>
<p>one way or the</p>
<p>other in five</p>
<p>days but fortunately i had a really cool doctor</p>
<p>i was sitting there in the waiting room just like</p>
<p>just rocking</p>
<p>back and forth what the fuck why did i bang that chick</p>
<p>jesus christ</p>
<p>i knew so fucking weak</p>
<p>why did i give into it right</p>
<p>and he came walking up and he was really cool</p>
<p>he said mr bercombe</p>
<p>he said come on back he goes don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>worry you&rsquo;re all set like he set it in the waiting room</p>
<p>he didn&rsquo;t let me take</p>
<p>that long walk</p>
<p>like the next douchebag</p>
<p>like i would like</p>
<p>the only time i</p>
<p>would get tested</p>
<p>would be like if i was getting into a relationship and</p>
<p>basically the girl said</p>
<p>we need to go out and get tested for</p>
<p>everything and i was like</p>
<p>yeah let&rsquo;s be responsible and i was like fuck</p>
<p>the guy taking my test i took i had to get insurance</p>
<p>when i first</p>
<p>moved to new york i</p>
<p>guess it was like 1991 that&rsquo;s why i took my first test</p>
<p>and the guy who was testing me said</p>
<p>have you ever</p>
<p>had gay sex no have you ever shared a needle</p>
<p>no he goes you don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>nothing to worry about</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m like really</p>
<p>really ghost you got nothing to worry</p>
<p>about he goes</p>
<p>trust me you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna be okay</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m like this guy&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>being nice to me man he&rsquo;s just being nice and you just</p>
<p>think about all</p>
<p>those girls i</p>
<p>should&rsquo;ve wore a condom what the fuck was i thinking</p>
<p>and what does that mean i</p>
<p>should&rsquo;ve wore a condom if you knew she had</p>
<p>age you just</p>
<p>stick your dick</p>
<p>inside of her with a little tiny thin little</p>
<p>membrane protecting you from the</p>
<p>depths of hell</p>
<p>no you wouldn&rsquo;t you know it&rsquo;s fucking craziness</p>
<p>but i went and the guy did the same</p>
<p>thing he called</p>
<p>me up and he gave me the results over the phone</p>
<p>and as he called me up he goes joe</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re all set you&rsquo;re all set just want you to relax</p>
<p>no totally negative no problem</p>
<p>yeah but for fucking days oh shit in my</p>
<p>pants convinced</p>
<p>convinced that i&rsquo;m like a red</p>
<p>shirt virgin</p>
<p>what do you</p>
<p>think about that and how much knowledge that</p>
<p>we have what we really know the average person knows</p>
<p>about medical science</p>
<p>and think about</p>
<p>what it must have been like when medical science didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>exist and so you thought you really were cursed</p>
<p>you know the shit probably worked</p>
<p>you know you</p>
<p>could probably</p>
<p>curse someone with witchcraft</p>
<p>and they probably</p>
<p>would fucking trip</p>
<p>everywhere they go and fall</p>
<p>and land on</p>
<p>their fucking face and</p>
<p>break their neck or</p>
<p>psychological</p>
<p>you think everything that happens that&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>when people say bad</p>
<p>things come in</p>
<p>threes it&rsquo;s no you keep restarting counting</p>
<p>after three</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what happens</p>
<p>people go up this this and then this</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like yeah</p>
<p>then this that</p>
<p>makes four if you</p>
<p>count back to the beginning of your life</p>
<p>you know is it divisible by</p>
<p>three it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s life bad shit happens</p>
<p>good it&rsquo;s like whenever a celebrity dies they</p>
<p>would say you know that&rsquo;s three</p>
<p>yeah it all comes in</p>
<p>three this is a</p>
<p>thing though</p>
<p>even jokes when you describe jokes they come in</p>
<p>through the best way to tell a joke</p>
<p>i have yeah i usually have three</p>
<p>three examples</p>
<p>you know that are</p>
<p>ridiculous i</p>
<p>know that&rsquo;s true</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m just talking</p>
<p>about the bad show</p>
<p>why is that though that</p>
<p>things in three</p>
<p>celebrities dies</p>
<p>celebrities</p>
<p>dying in three</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t people</p>
<p>recount after</p>
<p>three if they went one</p>
<p>right they were</p>
<p>talking about a</p>
<p>small period in time it&rsquo;s not like time is</p>
<p>open ended they&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about over a course of a couple of weeks three very</p>
<p>famous people will die and it happens all the time</p>
<p>it really does</p>
<p>it really doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know that people just stop</p>
<p>counting at</p>
<p>three and they</p>
<p>start over again i could</p>
<p>say like somebody</p>
<p>would die like two days</p>
<p>later and well you know</p>
<p>yeah or if a guy</p>
<p>dies like a month</p>
<p>later then they go okay that&rsquo;s one</p>
<p>you wait you wait and it&rsquo;s like yeah</p>
<p>and then i guess</p>
<p>chinese celebrities probably don&rsquo;t count</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s a billion people over there they must be</p>
<p>dropping off</p>
<p>every day yeah</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>famous country singers to you that</p>
<p>would have been like the biggest star ever where</p>
<p>other who me i don&rsquo;t even know who</p>
<p>that guy is wrap your fucking head around the fact that</p>
<p>china has more than</p>
<p>three times the people that america has</p>
<p>more than three times what they</p>
<p>got people shitting on the side of the road</p>
<p>i said on the podcast that they were</p>
<p>self sustainable</p>
<p>that they but</p>
<p>apparently they&rsquo;re not anymore</p>
<p>apparently now they&rsquo;re importing</p>
<p>grain people got</p>
<p>upset at me so</p>
<p>no i guess they&rsquo;d not but you know what i want to hear</p>
<p>about and they also put in grain</p>
<p>i always wonder like i wonder if that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>wonder if they&rsquo;re forced to</p>
<p>do that wonder if they&rsquo;re forced to buy like american</p>
<p>grain we sell them</p>
<p>grain and you</p>
<p>know if you want to read a</p>
<p>great article is the one in rolling</p>
<p>stone this month that has howard</p>
<p>stern on the</p>
<p>cover is they talk</p>
<p>about these two</p>
<p>basically potheads</p>
<p>who became these international arms dealers</p>
<p>and just how that</p>
<p>whole thing goes down how countries</p>
<p>when they want to arm</p>
<p>a certain side in some</p>
<p>smaller country</p>
<p>but they don&rsquo;t want the shit coming back to them</p>
<p>how they go</p>
<p>about it how</p>
<p>they go through</p>
<p>these people</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some website</p>
<p>christ what</p>
<p>the hell is it i can&rsquo;t remember but it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>the military is</p>
<p>required to put all</p>
<p>their contracts on it</p>
<p>so you can read all</p>
<p>their contracts</p>
<p>this is typical</p>
<p>me something interesting and i can&rsquo;t tell you</p>
<p>where to go to</p>
<p>and you can read all</p>
<p>their contracts and they&rsquo;re open to any bidder</p>
<p>i think they&rsquo;re in the bush administration</p>
<p>they made it like that you know so i don&rsquo;t know free</p>
<p>enterprise i</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t know what but it kind of seemed like it was a way</p>
<p>for them to then arm certain people</p>
<p>without it coming back it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>basically having</p>
<p>other people do your</p>
<p>dirty work but just the way well that&rsquo;s what the</p>
<p>whole idea about</p>
<p>mercenaries is i mean that&rsquo;s what the big complaint</p>
<p>about what you know</p>
<p>black water and</p>
<p>those types of groups</p>
<p>is that we use them overseas and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>basically a way to get away with doing like really</p>
<p>dirty shit oh yeah</p>
<p>but totally legally</p>
<p>thing i mean</p>
<p>this is how i look at it</p>
<p>everybody does it and i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>what their endgame</p>
<p>right but she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>been doing it i mean dude</p>
<p>if we are what we pretend we are</p>
<p>then we should be the ones who</p>
<p>stand up and say that this is</p>
<p>this is what you can&rsquo;t do</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t torture prisoners</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>absolutely can</p>
<p>do that are we</p>
<p>gonna be the only</p>
<p>country that actually</p>
<p>sticks by what we say we are because everybody seems to</p>
<p>be someone has to lead an example right</p>
<p>do we say the</p>
<p>world filled with line cunt so we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna be line cunts i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>i mean i see what you&rsquo;re saying i see the</p>
<p>other argument that like look the</p>
<p>world&rsquo;s a dirty</p>
<p>place and you&rsquo;re gonna have</p>
<p>people that are willing to do your bidding</p>
<p>no you know like yeah no</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t get how war is legal</p>
<p>and i don&rsquo;t get how</p>
<p>like jesus freaks and really religious people</p>
<p>get behind war</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve been doing</p>
<p>it for like the inquisitions and the and the crusades</p>
<p>they they were taking murderers out of prison</p>
<p>going you are forgiven</p>
<p>and then unleashing them</p>
<p>in like the middle east to do what</p>
<p>the reason why you</p>
<p>stuck them behind bars but</p>
<p>they just doing it for the church did they really yeah</p>
<p>what year was this</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just some fucking website i&rsquo;ve read it off of</p>
<p>i looked at it</p>
<p>for three minutes well one of the reasons why i want to</p>
<p>have percent of this fact</p>
<p>i mean i always</p>
<p>loved my space</p>
<p>talking to you but</p>
<p>i know that you&rsquo;re one of</p>
<p>those guys that</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t believe anything in</p>
<p>the news is what it is news</p>
<p>motherfuckers</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s why i wanted to talk to you</p>
<p>about all this shit that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on in the middle east it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>every fucking day some new</p>
<p>government is being overthrown</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s getting really</p>
<p>weird to the</p>
<p>point where i&rsquo;m like man are they</p>
<p>like fucking prepping for something like what is</p>
<p>going down how</p>
<p>is it really what everybody says it is that</p>
<p>all of a sudden with the internet people are becoming</p>
<p>aware and they&rsquo;re all rising up</p>
<p>it takes more than just being</p>
<p>aware to get people to risk</p>
<p>their fucking lives and get</p>
<p>i mean in libya this</p>
<p>motherfuckers flying jets and launching missiles into</p>
<p>crowds and shit he&rsquo;s killing people</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re shooting</p>
<p>right into crowds</p>
<p>might not be with jets but i</p>
<p>might have made that up</p>
<p>but i know they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>shooting into</p>
<p>crowds and killing people left and</p>
<p>right like these</p>
<p>people that are fighting</p>
<p>against him</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a movement that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going down i don&rsquo;t know what it is but it was you know</p>
<p>the real thing but you know the real thing</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s guys out there</p>
<p>who we put in power</p>
<p>and we were cool with and then when</p>
<p>they stop being cool</p>
<p>with us then we go in and then we try to take them out</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll tell you know what&rsquo;s really fucked up where</p>
<p>those celebrities who went out and they did like a</p>
<p>corporate gig</p>
<p>for like gaddafi&rsquo;s kids</p>
<p>and they try to act like oh i didn&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like dude</p>
<p>if you work at a comedy club and there&rsquo;s somebody like</p>
<p>in a wheelchair</p>
<p>the club owner comes back hey not</p>
<p>telling you how to do your act just letting you know</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s someone in the</p>
<p>crowd the wheelchair so i mean you know</p>
<p>just if you</p>
<p>wear a midget</p>
<p>choke that you</p>
<p>close with you</p>
<p>might want to not use it</p>
<p>right so these people are</p>
<p>going to perform</p>
<p>for the kids of a mass murderer don&rsquo;t you</p>
<p>think they get some sort of halftime</p>
<p>speech listen don&rsquo;t say this</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t want to offend</p>
<p>their cult just letting them know like i had no idea</p>
<p>i was really</p>
<p>disappointed when i saw you performed for gaddafi</p>
<p>what was it</p>
<p>beyonce usher</p>
<p>mariah carey and</p>
<p>then they all donated it to charity but only</p>
<p>cause they got busted</p>
<p>gaddafi pegs that&rsquo;s what i heard</p>
<p>gaddafi pays he pegs</p>
<p>why are you just making shit up</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re asking people if they should give their</p>
<p>their money back apparently there&rsquo;s a lot yeah</p>
<p>beyonce did it huh yeah and i saw this</p>

<p>entertain that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>scumbag is it just so much</p>
<p>money like what are they all they pay</p>
<p>a million bucks for like a</p>

<p>standing out in your living room</p>
<p>going full out doing</p>
<p>hot fucking routines be awesome for the kid of a murder</p>
<p>of a mass murderer the guy</p>
<p>admittedly is behind those pan am bombings</p>

<p>would be easy</p>
<p>guys fall in the wood</p>
<p>chippers all the time man i saw i saw a guy get busted</p>

<p>shook his hand like ah</p>
<p>fuck it&rsquo;s like alright who</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t pick their nose</p>
<p>then he adjusts his dick</p>
<p>and at one point he&rsquo;s in the middle of telling me</p>
<p>about being on a</p>
<p>stakeout he</p>
<p>starts digging in his ass</p>

<p>psycho i think there&rsquo;s a certain well i</p>
<p>think everybody&rsquo;s a comic is a little bit of a psycho</p>
<p>you know just a the act of</p>
<p>going on stage demanding that kind of attention</p>
<p>lit microphone</p>
<p>voice the whole deal</p>
<p>i woke up the</p>
<p>other day i had an</p>
<p>argument with a girl i went out with fifteen years ago</p>
<p>about what but i ask it&rsquo;s a long fucking</p>
<p>story just some bullshit</p>
<p>she did something stupid</p>
<p>she did something</p>
<p>stupid all right and i wanted to be like</p>
<p>i was trying</p>
<p>she fucked up in her life</p>
<p>and she fucked up so bad i was actually scared</p>
<p>going how am i</p>
<p>gonna pick her up off the mat</p>
<p>cause i know if i did some shit like that</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll be thinking</p>
<p>about kilma</p>
<p>she fucked up so</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m trying to</p>
<p>build her up</p>
<p>and the whole</p>
<p>time a little more specific about</p>
<p>she just goes now</p>
<p>she just goes i know i know she kept</p>
<p>going i know i know i just</p>
<p>remember being so fucking people like you know what</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re a fucking moron</p>
<p>but did you</p>
<p>arrogant pig headed</p>
<p>it just you have a nice</p>
<p>house so yeah</p>
<p>so i woke up</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what i was my eyes</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t even open</p>
<p>i was laying in a fucking hotel</p>
<p>yelling at it with my eyes closed</p>
<p>and then sort</p>
<p>of knowing in my head how fucked up that is</p>
<p>how long ago was</p>
<p>this argument he had with her like i said it was like</p>
<p>fifteen years ago so by yourself you&rsquo;re in a hotel room</p>
<p>you wake up your eyes aren&rsquo;t even open</p>
<p>and you go like you fucking</p>
<p>dummy i told you</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>crazy you need</p>
<p>to go to what that is dude</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve been you need a cat scan homie</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve been to one</p>

<p>gonna be fine and i</p>
<p>went back to</p>
<p>sleep i swear</p>
<p>to god it&rsquo;s fine</p>
<p>well sometimes it&rsquo;s a good</p>
<p>thing to do</p>
<p>to actually have conversations with yourself</p>

<p>aware that you&rsquo;re a psycho</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s step one and then just you you know</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re a psycho you&rsquo;re</p>

<p>right he&rsquo;s right i</p>
<p>agree with he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>right but he&rsquo;s wrong but</p>
<p>no this is what i&rsquo;ll tell you this is why</p>
<p>sam kennison</p>
<p>is underrated</p>
<p>before he let fame consume him</p>
<p>and he did a special with fucking</p>
<p>girls on the ends of dog</p>
<p>leashes dude his</p>
<p>first specials</p>
<p>his first letterman yes</p>
<p>still holds up yes yes i</p>
<p>with you a hundred percent i</p>
<p>say it all the time to me</p>
<p>that is the test of how</p>
<p>people go talking</p>
<p>about comics now all</p>
<p>this guy&rsquo;s this this guy&rsquo;s that you&rsquo;re not gonna know</p>
<p>until 15 20 years</p>
<p>later and then you go back and you listen to this</p>
<p>stuff does it hold up you know kennison and</p>
<p>86 was the best</p>
<p>comic that ever</p>
<p>lived that&rsquo;s what i</p>
<p>think the kennison</p>
<p>that came out there was</p>
<p>never a guy like him</p>
<p>there was never a guy who was fucking</p>
<p>screaming how how</p>
<p>he had his own</p>
<p>thing in his</p>
<p>rage but you get in</p>
<p>front of people</p>
<p>see this face to this face</p>
<p>this is marriage</p>
<p>motherfucker</p>
<p>just screaming you know there&rsquo;s nobody like</p>
<p>that what what</p>
<p>about but he had the ability</p>
<p>to to reel it in and then unleash it like</p>
<p>yeah like a who&rsquo;s a preacher yeah like a lot of guys</p>
<p>who i&rsquo;ve been guilty you ever been on</p>
<p>stage you just feel like</p>
<p>jesus i just</p>
<p>screamed for an</p>
<p>hour that was bullshit and i said fuck too many times</p>
<p>to him but him he had</p>
<p>he had the ability</p>
<p>you know when he would</p>
<p>bring it down</p>
<p>yeah when he did that bit</p>
<p>about like necrophilia</p>
<p>when he&rsquo;s laying</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s laying face down and he&rsquo;s goes okay all</p>
<p>right so i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>dead you know he&rsquo;s all the way down there and then oh</p>
<p>oh what is that you know how i found out</p>
<p>about him one of the</p>
<p>greatest tags ever</p>
<p>it never ends it</p>
<p>never ends it&rsquo;s one of the</p>
<p>greatest life</p>
<p>keeps fucking in the ass even</p>
<p>after you&rsquo;re dead</p>
<p>it never ends but</p>
<p>he he suck but</p>
<p>all of that was in just the line it</p>
<p>never ends yeah</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just i</p>
<p>heard about</p>
<p>that bit because</p>
<p>i was working at the boston athletic club and</p>
<p>there was a girl who worked there and she just got home</p>
<p>from seeing the hbo</p>
<p>comedy special with sam kennison and she</p>
<p>reenacted that bit</p>
<p>in the fucking parking lot of the club in</p>
<p>south boston</p>
<p>she got in her stomach</p>
<p>and she goes</p>
<p>so i&rsquo;m dead i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna be with</p>
<p>jesus oh oh</p>
<p>what is this</p>
<p>it feels like there&rsquo;s a dick in my ass</p>
<p>you mean life keeps fucking you in the ass even</p>
<p>after you&rsquo;re dead</p>
<p>it never ends</p>
<p>it never ends oh oh</p>
<p>and i was like that is the</p>
<p>funny i was 19 and i remember</p>
<p>thinking that is the funniest fucking</p>
<p>thing i&rsquo;ve ever</p>
<p>heard in my life</p>
<p>and then i got a copy of it</p>
<p>this was the</p>
<p>first time i ever thought</p>
<p>i could get comedy</p>
<p>this is sort of throw off</p>
<p>bit that he did or it was just a cd</p>
<p>after you died</p>
<p>they did like this compilation he did like the</p>
<p>whole that whole bit on captain kangaroo</p>
<p>which would normally be like a hacky bit</p>
<p>but he got into the psyche of</p>
<p>of the guy playing captain kangaroo this was the</p>
<p>later cd right</p>
<p>yeah this was like one of his last ones yeah and he</p>
<p>was it&rsquo;s one of the</p>
<p>things that he decided not to put out and then</p>
<p>he dies and then somebody else puts it out it&rsquo;s one of</p>
<p>those things</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s kinda not fair like</p>
<p>a lot of the</p>
<p>other material</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t you know up to</p>
<p>snuff but he</p>
<p>never released it dirt when he was</p>
<p>alive so i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t criticize him for that but</p>
<p>the the captain kangaroo</p>
<p>bit dude where</p>
<p>he gets into the</p>
<p>psyche of the guy yeah</p>
<p>talking about and he somehow he</p>
<p>brings it all around</p>
<p>to he was an out of work actor so he took the gig</p>
<p>in the end of the bit he&rsquo;s yelling at his wife</p>
<p>going we needed the cash</p>
<p>you know i didn&rsquo;t know the kick was</p>
<p>gonna last 20 fucking</p>
<p>years and just</p>
<p>screaming about</p>
<p>his fucking haircut</p>
<p>and just the the horrific life</p>
<p>of this guy of being captain</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s what makes somebody</p>
<p>great the ability</p>
<p>anybody can be like</p>
<p>you know captain</p>
<p>kangaroo what&rsquo;s up with this guy like he got</p>
<p>underneath the</p>
<p>whole thing</p>
<p>and just he turned the guy</p>
<p>you saw the actor that played him yeah</p>
<p>which i grew up watching</p>
<p>and here&rsquo;s the most important</p>
<p>thing and this is</p>
<p>where i mean</p>
<p>again i&rsquo;m a huge bill hicks fan i</p>
<p>think what he did was brilliant</p>
<p>and he changed the way i looked at a lot of</p>
<p>things and he opened my eyes up to a lot of</p>
<p>things that were fascinating and interesting</p>
<p>but not necessarily</p>
<p>funny and i</p>
<p>would scream and</p>
<p>cheer with it and i</p>
<p>would laugh</p>
<p>along with it because i agreed with it</p>

<p>kinesin and he</p>
<p>would make a</p>
<p>point that would fucking have you</p>
<p>doubled over with laughing</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s totally different</p>
<p>like there&rsquo;s a hicks bit that you can find online</p>
<p>about hicks talking about</p>
<p>he wants his</p>
<p>rock stars to have passion it&rsquo;s another one of</p>
<p>these things you know he wants his rock stars to go on</p>
<p>stage and take good</p>
<p>night everybody and</p>
<p>shoot yourself in the head and do heroin</p>
<p>all these different</p>

<p>where i talk about like</p>
<p>conspiracy theory and that type of</p>
<p>thing and i&rsquo;m not into that</p>
<p>but i&rsquo;m always conscious like one of the words i avoid</p>
<p>when i do my act is the word we</p>
<p>whenever somebody uses that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a fucking turn off to me and i feel like i&rsquo;m being</p>
<p>preached at i mean</p>
<p>i learned that really</p>
<p>ugh i learned that that&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>weird i think it&rsquo;s your</p>
<p>knighting word</p>
<p>no i no it depends on how you do it but i just i saw a</p>
<p>comic a long time ago at the comic</p>

<p>funny i&rsquo;m gonna</p>
<p>laugh but like</p>
<p>like i don&rsquo;t like be i don&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>preachiness i don&rsquo;t like being</p>
<p>self aware i don&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>fake shit yeah yeah that you&rsquo;re being dangerous</p>
<p>or yeah or like pushing an</p>
<p>image or like you</p>
<p>know you&rsquo;re going on</p>
<p>stage with an</p>
<p>image and you&rsquo;re trying hard to push it</p>
<p>yeah i worked with this</p>
<p>chick laura</p>
<p>house once you know who she is</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s a comic</p>
<p>funny girl from</p>
<p>i believe she&rsquo;s from</p>
<p>texas and she</p>
<p>lived in san francisco and</p>
<p>when she met me</p>
<p>the first thing she said she took a deep breath</p>
<p>she goes i heard you&rsquo;re really like</p>
<p>edgy and dark and i was so</p>
<p>worried you were</p>
<p>gonna show up wearing black</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s hilarious</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s hilarious yeah she goes i was so</p>
<p>worried you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna be one of</p>
<p>those guys with a</p>
<p>black shirt and</p>
<p>black jeans sitting in the</p>
<p>green room and</p>
<p>angst i have a bill hicks</p>
<p>shirt that says do you</p>
<p>think i&rsquo;m wearing all</p>
<p>black in the summer because i&rsquo;m a ray of sunshine</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like you know</p>
<p>like i&rsquo;m wearing but i&rsquo;m wearing</p>
<p>black i&rsquo;m dangerous</p>
<p>it is sort of fucking</p>
<p>stupid it&rsquo;s an outfit no different</p>
<p>than ones that someone wears at burger king or</p>
<p>at a fucking monastery</p>
<p>wearing a big</p>
<p>stupid orange robe</p>
<p>i will give it up to him</p>
<p>like his his</p>
<p>leno bit was</p>
<p>great like he had</p>
<p>great shit but</p>
<p>i shouldn&rsquo;t say</p>
<p>some of his</p>
<p>stuff was funny you know</p>
<p>i laughed at it but ari</p>
<p>was making a very valid</p>
<p>point that there&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>fluff in his bits of just him talking</p>
<p>about ideas</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s nothing</p>
<p>wrong with that i</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s interesting</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t need to</p>
<p>laugh every</p>
<p>minute to be</p>
<p>entertained yeah like</p>
<p>i said it&rsquo;s like 20 years</p>
<p>later and then you&rsquo;re also talking</p>
<p>about a guy</p>
<p>who went down a road</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>gonna get a sitcom you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>gonna leap to</p>
<p>movies so there&rsquo;s you</p>
<p>gotta give the guy credit oh yeah</p>
<p>that he did that he had a lot of</p>
<p>artistic integrity but that&rsquo;s also who he was</p>
<p>i mean it&rsquo;s not like he was</p>
<p>gonna get one anyway dude you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna get tweets</p>
<p>where people</p>
<p>are gonna get mad at</p>
<p>me where people say kinesin</p>
<p>sucks so it&rsquo;s one of</p>
<p>those deals</p>
<p>where it all comes down sure i</p>
<p>definitely like personal</p>
<p>taste for me</p>
<p>the guy during that period for me</p>
<p>but i have to be honest</p>
<p>one time i watched</p>
<p>i saw richard pryor&rsquo;s</p>
<p>first specials</p>
<p>when i was but i hadn&rsquo;t even done comedy yet</p>
<p>i just moved out of my parents house</p>
<p>and i was with my buddies and we</p>
<p>watched two</p>
<p>we had a vhr</p>
<p>player and a fucking</p>
<p>vhs rather in an</p>
<p>apartment shitty</p>
<p>apartment waltham</p>
<p>and we watched</p>
<p>sam kennison</p>
<p>and then right</p>
<p>afterwards we</p>
<p>watched richard pryor</p>
<p>i was like wow</p>
<p>prior is way better</p>
<p>prior the first</p>
<p>prior the first</p>
<p>prior special</p>
<p>is just fucking brilliant it was brilliant</p>
<p>it wasn&rsquo;t that he was better</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just i&rsquo;ve almost felt like god why was kennison</p>
<p>screaming so much</p>
<p>you know what i mean</p>
<p>like prior like</p>
<p>prior was so</p>
<p>smooth and so real on stage</p>
<p>where since</p>
<p>kennison was putting on a show</p>
<p>it was a brilliant fucking show</p>
<p>but the way he was talking to you was not the way you</p>
<p>would really talk to someone</p>
<p>you know oh</p>
<p>oh i live in hell</p>
<p>i was married for two fucking years whereas</p>
<p>prior would be talking to you the way he really felt</p>
<p>and you were</p>
<p>drawn into him as a human being well</p>
<p>this is how i look</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s certain</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a very few guys but certain guys</p>
<p>who just take it so far you can&rsquo;t be surpassed</p>
<p>i would say him</p>
<p>james brown all</p>
<p>funk music that has</p>
<p>come known as ever done it better than that guy</p>
<p>you never you</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s very few guys as a handful of artists that</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re just you can&rsquo;t pass that have you ever seen the</p>
<p>james brown live in zaire clip</p>
<p>you wanna shit</p>
<p>we played this on here once with joey diaz</p>
<p>find that brian</p>
<p>pull that shit up on your ipad</p>
<p>james brown live in zai</p>
<p>yeah i&rsquo;ve seen that that&rsquo;s it is</p>
<p>what yeah one of the</p>
<p>greatest performances</p>
<p>that human race has ever</p>
<p>seen and this</p>
<p>is the thing that was just one night</p>
<p>yeah yeah just one night</p>
<p>it was like 50</p>
<p>and he kept banging that out all over the country</p>
<p>he would throw that mic</p>
<p>stand off his</p>
<p>shoulder and kick it and</p>
<p>he just fucking it</p>
<p>never missed a beat never</p>
<p>slipped he had</p>
<p>leather fucking</p>
<p>slippery bottom</p>
<p>shoes on spinning around i also liked</p>
<p>as far as like</p>
<p>you know when you work with a comedian and</p>
<p>after like two shows you realize oh this guy</p>
<p>is gonna do the</p>
<p>exact same jokes in the</p>
<p>exact same order</p>
<p>that whole shit with a band</p>
<p>he just starts if he decides he&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>gonna talk they just</p>
<p>start playing on like a loop</p>
<p>like that&rsquo;s what i like when i when i i</p>
<p>watch like bands like you can tell when they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re improving</p>
<p>is because they don&rsquo;t look at the</p>
<p>crowd they&rsquo;re fucking looking at the</p>
<p>same just waiting for some sort of cue like what is he</p>
<p>doing like steve when i used to</p>
<p>watch stevie ray</p>
<p>vaughan yeah like</p>
<p>like some of the live shit that he did</p>
<p>i was knows</p>
<p>tommy shana chris</p>
<p>late in the drum and the</p>
<p>baseball in the drum of</p>
<p>they would always be kind of looking at me and</p>
<p>once you got educated to</p>
<p>watching him enough you</p>
<p>would see the nods</p>
<p>where like sometimes</p>
<p>they would be looking thinking</p>
<p>oh here he comes he&rsquo;s coming out of it nah nah</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s going back into more soloing</p>
<p>and then he&rsquo;d be on his way out and he just</p>
<p>would just sort of glance over at him</p>
<p>and then seamlessly that such shit</p>
<p>just blows me away when</p>
<p>people were able to do that well he&rsquo;s just practicing</p>
<p>together all the time like that i</p>
<p>guess you just get tuned in</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know i just i&rsquo;m not a</p>
<p>musician so i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>understand it you play drums right</p>
<p>yeah and that&rsquo;s the kind of</p>
<p>thing but i&rsquo;m like the same way i watch</p>
<p>sports like</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m a geek like i wish i played the nfl but you</p>
<p>know i wish</p>
<p>you played drums i wish no i can play drums</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m decent for a comedian but like</p>
<p>like how good</p>
<p>those guys are</p>
<p>man sure like i went to a fallon tape and i was</p>
<p>watching the</p>
<p>roots i actually got to see them play during</p>
<p>the break dude they&rsquo;re fucking</p>
<p>ridiculous amazing</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re ridiculous amazing</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t even have to look at each</p>
<p>other that&rsquo;s what blows me away they just sorta</p>
<p>kj and i glanced at them</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s do this for a</p>
<p>while yeah well</p>
<p>they probably</p>
<p>think you&rsquo;re doing that when you go on</p>
<p>stage and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>free balling sometimes talking to somebody in the</p>
<p>crowd and all of a</p>
<p>sudden it becomes a bit</p>
<p>and how many times you&rsquo;ve done that</p>
<p>someone will say something in the crowd</p>
<p>and you go look at this fucking guy he</p>
<p>thinks all of a</p>
<p>sudden he&rsquo;s at a carnival</p>
<p>hey i&rsquo;ll have some popcorn please</p>
<p>you know and then you turn it into a fucking bit</p>
<p>how many times have you done that</p>
<p>yeah but talk to people that say</p>
<p>after you get off</p>
<p>stage like is that guy a plant</p>
<p>he goes nah</p>
<p>i was just fucking around with that guy</p>
<p>you made all that up on the spot i know but the thing</p>
<p>about it is</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re locked into you</p>
<p>right you gotta fucking</p>
<p>worry about</p>
<p>the guy and the bongos and the dude over here like is</p>
<p>this guy paying attention when i go to do this did he</p>
<p>did he see what he just did</p>
<p>like gave the</p>
<p>little nod like i don&rsquo;t get how it works but like</p>
<p>maybe it&rsquo;s cause i can&rsquo;t do it that i&rsquo;m so</p>
<p>blown away by it but no you good</p>
<p>point i can&rsquo;t do it either i don&rsquo;t even i</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t even know</p>
<p>where to start</p>
<p>i think it&rsquo;s the same</p>
<p>thing though i</p>
<p>think when you tune into comedy</p>
<p>i guess it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gotta be harder because you</p>
<p>gotta have a</p>
<p>bunch of people that are</p>
<p>tuned into make it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gotta be all</p>
<p>about everyone making the song better</p>
<p>it can&rsquo;t be all</p>
<p>about like okay here&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s time for</p>
<p>tommy&rsquo;s fucking drum solo he needs a drum solo</p>
<p>every song or he gets pissed off</p>
<p>and this guy</p>
<p>gets to go off and then it becomes like</p>
<p>self indulgent</p>
<p>but when it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>tuned in and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just to make the song better and they do it together</p>
<p>you know i guess that&rsquo;s what you like</p>
<p>jazz is supposed to be all</p>
<p>about right everybody like</p>
<p>does it together to make</p>
<p>the song better that&rsquo;s just me</p>
<p>once i got out of that bam</p>
<p>i can&rsquo;t listen when it</p>
<p>sounds like five guys playing five different songs and</p>
<p>i just read</p>
<p>on my message word</p>
<p>about this cause i said that i hate jazz</p>
<p>and i don&rsquo;t really hate jazz i just don&rsquo;t like it</p>
<p>i shouldn&rsquo;t say</p>
<p>i hate it because i do listen to it sometimes in the</p>
<p>background it&rsquo;s true</p>
<p>have you ever listened</p>
<p>to that yeah i&rsquo;ve listened to a lot of different shit</p>
<p>look i don&rsquo;t but i</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t choose it over fucking the almond brothers</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;d choose it over</p>
<p>maybe if it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just fucking</p>
<p>leonard skinner</p>
<p>sweet home alabama</p>
<p>music is the only</p>
<p>thing i cannot fucking listen to</p>
<p>other than if it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>early on oh</p>
<p>man dwight yokom</p>
<p>i can listen to dwight yokom that guy&rsquo;s a bad</p>
<p>motherfucker and i even like some</p>
<p>stupid shit i like some kobe</p>

<p>stupid shit it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t bother</p>

<p>nelson or something i</p>
<p>shouldn&rsquo;t do</p>
<p>this i shouldn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>judge people</p>
<p>but when some people don&rsquo;t like certain things i</p>
<p>think badly of them</p>

<p>crank this shit up jeff beck is unreal</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a slightly different version</p>
<p>i mean it&rsquo;s not what jimi hendrix did it&rsquo;s different</p>
<p>see he&rsquo;s got like a little</p>
<p>twang going you know what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>funny is in the middle</p>
<p>he does a solo</p>
<p>on one of them and he actually is playing</p>
<p>the harmony of a hendrix song when he played with</p>
<p>bandit gypsies</p>
<p>crank this shit up brian</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s the only guy that comes close to hendrix</p>
<p>with this song</p>
<p>yeah no overall</p>
<p>hendrix stomps him oh yeah he came up with yeah</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s the man i mean he&rsquo;s a complete original</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re both heroin addicts</p>
<p>that ain&rsquo;t a coincidence no</p>
<p>he kicked it i think he&rsquo;s coke he was heroin too buddy</p>
<p>heroin makes you feel that groove</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know what it is but</p>
<p>those singers love that heroin</p>
<p>musicians love that heroin</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a great one</p>
<p>even when he</p>
<p>saved it you ever see when he got booed</p>
<p>no he got booed</p>
<p>steve ravon i hope they&rsquo;re all in hell now no</p>
<p>bring this down this is great</p>
<p>why they why</p>
<p>did the performance gives me</p>
<p>chills too this what happened he went over to the</p>
<p>still not as good as hendrix</p>
<p>the pretty goddamn good but not as good yeah</p>
<p>the the monterey jazz festival he played at</p>
<p>so they pursued him for some</p>
<p>stupid reason they book them</p>
<p>at a jazz festival</p>
<p>and he plays blues he plays loud i mean</p>
<p>other than like</p>
<p>stank swang i mean it&rsquo;s not a lot of jazzy shit</p>
<p>so everybody had been playing acoustic</p>
<p>up to that point</p>
<p>i think it was in france i don&rsquo;t know what it was</p>
<p>somewhere over in europe so he goes out there unknown</p>
<p>and he went out there and</p>
<p>starts playing his</p>
<p>stuff and it took</p>
<p>about two three songs in and they</p>
<p>started booing him</p>
<p>and you could see it was affecting him</p>
<p>but when they would</p>
<p>start playing the song dude he</p>
<p>total commitment</p>
<p>it gets me chills</p>
<p>every time i</p>
<p>watch it it&rsquo;s on one of his dvds they finally showed it</p>
<p>and but that was the time when</p>
<p>david bowie</p>
<p>was in the crowd and</p>
<p>david bowie&rsquo;s</p>
<p>watching him</p>
<p>going this guy&rsquo;s a beast</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s how he</p>
<p>ended up playing the solo on</p>
<p>that song let&rsquo;s dance</p>
<p>while he was bombing that&rsquo;s funny</p>
<p>you can bomb</p>
<p>way better as a</p>
<p>musician though than you can as a comic</p>
<p>as a musician all you have to do is just do the song</p>
<p>as a comic this was pretty brutal</p>
<p>cause he was playing by the time he got to the</p>
<p>third song or something like you can audib</p>
<p>you can audibly hear booze</p>
<p>yeah but the thing is</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s as much as it&rsquo;s bugging him he still</p>
<p>fucking is just ripping</p>
<p>on the it&rsquo;s unbelievable and he and he gets off</p>
<p>stage i remember reading the</p>
<p>thing where he said i&rsquo;m a</p>
<p>total see ray</p>
<p>vaughan head he got off</p>
<p>stage and he&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>jesus i didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think we were that bad</p>
<p>and then of course he got with</p>
<p>david bowie</p>
<p>but we wanted him to go on tour and do like these</p>
<p>dance steps and he</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t fucking do it</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s just like i&rsquo;m not doing it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>a comedian not selling out and he went back to texas</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m gonna go back with my trio we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna try to make it</p>
<p>that way so he got huge credibility that way and then</p>
<p>then he blew up and then a couple years</p>
<p>later he went back to</p>
<p>the monterey</p>
<p>jazz festival of course they were giving him</p>
<p>but we wanted</p>
<p>him to do dance steps</p>
<p>yeah it was probably step one to sucking his cock</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s probably what it was</p>
<p>he was like</p>
<p>texas two steps on</p>
<p>my fucking volunteer</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna have a</p>
<p>choreographer we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna work together and</p>
<p>before our performance let&rsquo;s just let&rsquo;s take a shower</p>
<p>they wanted</p>
<p>him yeah he was</p>
<p>gonna be on the let&rsquo;s dance tour</p>
<p>you know we had that</p>
<p>whole pop you know put on your red</p>
<p>shoes that whole pop and</p>
<p>he wanted it</p>
<p>there was some sort of</p>
<p>thing he was coming down the</p>
<p>stairs and he had to do like some little</p>
<p>dance step with everybody else and stevie would just</p>
<p>yeah i&rsquo;m not doing it</p>
<p>we just walked down and then finally he was just like</p>
<p>i can&rsquo;t do this shit this is just yeah</p>
<p>replace me steve</p>
<p>so he left this huge</p>
<p>fucking tour with</p>
<p>david bowie wow</p>
<p>and i heard</p>
<p>he also used to get mad look at all his gossip i know</p>
<p>used to get mad that</p>
<p>the david bowie video</p>
<p>for let&rsquo;s dance</p>
<p>is david boy with a pair of gloves on</p>
<p>starts playing the solo that stevie played</p>
<p>i heard stevie saw the</p>
<p>video it was like nah he shouldn&rsquo;t be out there fucking</p>
<p>pretending like he played some shit he didn&rsquo;t play</p>
<p>wow yeah like all</p>
<p>stuff like that wow now this is all shit that just</p>
<p>like i poured</p>
<p>through the internet just reading all the that makes</p>
<p>sense it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>comics that you know i mean how many</p>
<p>comics do you know that look down upon</p>
<p>comics that hired joke writers</p>
<p>you know we know a lot of guys there&rsquo;s a lot of guys</p>
<p>especially when they hit a certain</p>
<p>level they really</p>
<p>become like</p>
<p>almost like a figurehead</p>
<p>they almost become like a character</p>
<p>and then they have guys</p>
<p>right for them it looks old</p>
<p>school guys especially</p>
<p>well they have a lot of writers you know</p>
<p>you know i mean i</p>
<p>know a guy who has like five fucking writers and he&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>you know national headliner and he has all</p>
<p>these guys who</p>
<p>come up with his own jokes for him because he&rsquo;s too</p>
<p>busy with movies and all sorts of</p>
<p>shit that would</p>
<p>be really nice but that is no it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>no that isn&rsquo;t the way to do it this is</p>
<p>an idea tank at</p>
<p>least that&rsquo;s not the way to do it but like</p>
<p>as far as a business model</p>
<p>so your act</p>
<p>never slips down like</p>
<p>right i look at that with envy but it does</p>
<p>slip i look at it with envy because i go i</p>
<p>could never fucking do that</p>
<p>now watch like five</p>
<p>years now here&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the problem here&rsquo;s the problem</p>
<p>louis ck does it</p>
<p>absolutely the best</p>
<p>cause he does a new hour</p>
<p>every year and he does his own hour</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all his writing</p>
<p>when you hire somebody else man</p>
<p>you might agree that something&rsquo;s funny</p>
<p>you might agree that</p>
<p>this idea is</p>
<p>funny and you</p>
<p>might use it as a tool you say well i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna go on</p>
<p>stage i&rsquo;m gonna plug this</p>
<p>thing in and</p>
<p>press this button it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna get a big</p>
<p>laugh it&rsquo;s gonna work</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>gonna be your</p>
<p>thoughts being projected that&rsquo;s why i can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>get past it i can&rsquo;t get past</p>
<p>it how can i</p>
<p>stand and if it kills</p>
<p>and you be like you want to be like oh yeah keep it</p>
<p>going for frank</p>
<p>frank wrote that one you know no disrespect to the</p>
<p>comics that we know that</p>
<p>do use writers</p>
<p>that do use writers but they do not have the same</p>
<p>impact on me as guys like norton or guys like louie</p>
<p>or guys who i know</p>
<p>write their own shit</p>
<p>the guys so i know that this is</p>
<p>their thoughts like norton</p>

<p>over the last</p>
<p>night on the</p>
<p>way to the gym it&rsquo;s fucking hilarious it&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>twisted and</p>
<p>crazy he&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>funny man i</p>
<p>saw him when i was in austin i was there for the</p>
<p>to ufc and i had the friday</p>
<p>night off so a</p>
<p>buddy of mine who lives in austin</p>
<p>where i said hey you know jim lawrence</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s go see him</p>
<p>fucking killed it he was so funny dude</p>
<p>he made me want to go home and</p>
<p>write and he made me do</p>
<p>shorter sets</p>
<p>did like 50 minutes</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;ve been doing this</p>
<p>thing lately</p>
<p>where i did</p>
<p>like i was doing like an hour and a half sometimes two</p>
<p>hours and i</p>
<p>do like a big question and answer at the end</p>
<p>but i always felt like</p>
<p>in a lot of ways it kind</p>
<p>of like took away from the energy of like just one big</p>
<p>powerful performance big</p>
<p>time i am a huge believer that you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t go beyond an hour i&rsquo;ve done that and it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>you know you</p>
<p>do an hour that&rsquo;s perfect they get it you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>funny they walk out they got that excitement</p>
<p>yeah because i</p>
<p>pour myself out selling dvds</p>
<p>afterwards if i do an hour and 10 an hour and 15</p>
<p>they come out like yeah they&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>especially if you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>close strong yeah no even if you do though</p>
<p>even if you do it&rsquo;s just they&rsquo;re fucking exhausted yeah</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just like 50 to an hour</p>
<p>is you&rsquo;ve given them their</p>
<p>money&rsquo;s worth and</p>
<p>the classic</p>
<p>show business you left them wanting more</p>
<p>but you go beyond that</p>
<p>dude i saw a guy one time he did two hours okay</p>
<p>right in an hour</p>
<p>i looked at my watch</p>
<p>i just instinctively</p>
<p>i was like how much has he done oh</p>
<p>write it out look at me</p>
<p>this is my first kind of</p>
<p>okay i get it</p>
<p>i get it yeah this is your take on the</p>
<p>world i get it</p>
<p>out 15 hour and 20 dude hour and 25 my fucking ass is</p>
<p>starting to fall asleep i</p>
<p>agree and by</p>
<p>hour and 35</p>
<p>i came up with a strategy</p>
<p>for me and my girl to</p>
<p>leave because it was like was in a theater</p>
<p>and it was really</p>
<p>gonna be noticeable if we got up and left so</p>
<p>i ended up being</p>
<p>the bad guy she got up made it look like she was</p>
<p>going to the bathroom</p>
<p>and then i just</p>
<p>grabbed both our cooks i was</p>
<p>excuse me excuse me i saw people like oh my god</p>
<p>he was walking out it really</p>
<p>it really is</p>
<p>just too much to sit there and listen to well</p>
<p>that depends though depends though</p>
<p>cause i&rsquo;ve seen some guys</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve seen some hour and a half sets</p>
<p>where i was fucking real</p>
<p>happy that the show didn&rsquo;t end</p>
<p>like i saw chappelle</p>
<p>do an hour and a half at the comedy</p>
<p>store and i</p>
<p>enjoyed the fuck out of it i</p>
<p>enjoyed the</p>
<p>whole hour and a half</p>
<p>but then again i&rsquo;m a</p>
<p>stand up comic i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>a sewer of comedy</p>
<p>i had the night off i don&rsquo;t fucking have to get up at</p>
<p>seven in the morning i don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>at the time i didn&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>a normal job that i had to go to and work all day</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s like when</p>
<p>especially friday</p>
<p>night late show dude the show&rsquo;s fucking 10</p>
<p>o&rsquo;clock these people been up</p>
<p>since seven</p>
<p>you know that&rsquo;s a long ass time they&rsquo;re tired</p>
<p>as shit you&rsquo;re burning the crowd</p>
<p>out and they&rsquo;re drunk</p>
<p>you know and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>trying i think</p>
<p>it actually it decreases</p>
<p>them wanting to come and see you again</p>
<p>i definitely like if you go out there just</p>
<p>fucking just</p>
<p>blasted the</p>
<p>face that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it that&rsquo;s boston</p>
<p>style too yeah</p>
<p>boston style is</p>
<p>short and nobody</p>
<p>in boston ever did a fucking two hour set</p>
<p>they would look at you what are you</p>
<p>fucking retarded</p>
<p>he would even do</p>
<p>forty remember</p>
<p>those fucking</p>
<p>next comedy</p>
<p>stop sets where the fucking headliner</p>
<p>would do twenty minutes</p>
<p>everybody would do twenty</p>
<p>there be five guys doing</p>
<p>twenty minutes</p>
<p>and they would</p>
<p>do the same</p>
<p>twenty minutes for a hundred years and it</p>
<p>would be honed</p>
<p>to a samurai</p>
<p>sword sharpness yeah</p>
<p>don gavin his timing</p>
<p>he could talk</p>
<p>about anything and it</p>
<p>would be brilliant because he had talked</p>
<p>about it so long</p>
<p>he knew the</p>
<p>exact right beats and how to pause</p>
<p>not see all</p>
<p>those guys don</p>
<p>gavin made me</p>
<p>think that i shouldn&rsquo;t have been in comedy</p>
<p>made me think how</p>
<p>could i ever be as good as this guy i was an open micro</p>
<p>watching him</p>
<p>fucking destroy one</p>
<p>night it was stitches</p>
<p>comedy club okay</p>
<p>and it was the new stitches</p>
<p>which wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>as good as the old stitches it was nice because it</p>
<p>was bigger and it had a restaurant attached to it but</p>
<p>there was like carpet on the floor</p>
<p>the ceiling was a little too high didn&rsquo;t absorb</p>
<p>it didn&rsquo;t bounce back to</p>
<p>laughter like the old stitches</p>
<p>the old stitches were dark anyway</p>
<p>the fucking shows long dude it was like an open mic</p>
<p>night and you know</p>
<p>fifteen twenty</p>
<p>unfunny wannabe</p>
<p>assholes over and over</p>
<p>again go up and i was one of them</p>
<p>and then at the end</p>
<p>kevin flynn</p>
<p>i was part of</p>
<p>the yeah i was part of the problem for sure and i was</p>
<p>thinking wow this audience is exhausted at the end</p>
<p>kevin flynn</p>
<p>brings up don</p>
<p>gavin and he fucking</p>
<p>crushes he crushed to the</p>
<p>point where me and</p>
<p>chris mcguire</p>
<p>and a couple</p>
<p>other guys were sitting in the back room</p>
<p>hands in our face like the fucking home</p>
<p>alone kid going we</p>
<p>should just quit comedy yeah</p>
<p>we can&rsquo;t do this</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll never be able to do this i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>never gonna be that good we got</p>
<p>we need to stop</p>
<p>right now no that</p>
<p>was a great</p>
<p>thing i think</p>
<p>about that shit like</p>
<p>thank god i</p>
<p>started there</p>
<p>fuck there was a few</p>
<p>places like san francisco boston</p>
<p>in new york city</p>
<p>was a great</p>
<p>place back in the day i don&rsquo;t know it&rsquo;s like now but</p>
<p>they are not the same</p>
<p>unfortunately the last stop&rsquo;s gone and now</p>
<p>they do it on</p>
<p>sundays they call it the</p>
<p>comics union i think</p>
<p>but the old last stop the old one in</p>
<p>river oaks was the shit</p>
<p>you know that was</p>
<p>the place where you know i mean</p>
<p>kennison started out back then</p>
<p>you know they used to have it was the comedy annex i</p>
<p>think they called it</p>
<p>yeah by the time i got out there that</p>
<p>place was already gone</p>
<p>unfortunately man</p>
<p>i recorded my</p>
<p>first cd there</p>
<p>yeah and hicks did his</p>
<p>first special sandman</p>
<p>yeah the same club</p>
<p>see that thing</p>
<p>on the wall that&rsquo;s from 99 that&rsquo;s what i recorded my</p>
<p>that was my warner brother cd</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m gonna be dead someday and i did that in houston</p>
<p>that was when i was on newsradio and</p>
<p>there was only one</p>
<p>place in the country</p>
<p>where i would sell out</p>
<p>every show and that was houston</p>
<p>i&rsquo;d sell out way in advance</p>
<p>like i would sell out the</p>
<p>whole weekend by friday no one does</p>
<p>no i didn&rsquo;t do that anywhere else</p>
<p>you know and there&rsquo;s nowhere else but the</p>
<p>maybe i didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>maybe i sold out</p>
<p>one night in advance</p>
<p>the point is</p>
<p>there was no</p>
<p>place where</p>
<p>they would stuff in</p>
<p>extra people and violate the fire code</p>
<p>when i recorded my cd there</p>
<p>they stuffed in 50 60 people</p>
<p>over the fire code i mean there was people there was</p>
<p>chairs in the</p>
<p>aisles and shit it was ridiculous</p>
<p>but it was because that was the</p>
<p>style of comedy that they</p>
<p>loved like hicks and kinesin and they were both dead</p>
<p>by that time</p>
<p>like they had</p>
<p>like houston had developed</p>
<p>his taste too</p>
<p>did one of those</p>
<p>guys live yes both of them i saw both of them live</p>
<p>i saw kennison live only as an audience member</p>
<p>but i saw hicks live when i was already a</p>
<p>comic i saw him</p>
<p>live at least</p>
<p>three times</p>
<p>one time i left</p>
<p>the room because it wasn&rsquo;t doing so well</p>
<p>it was just like the audience</p>
<p>had no idea who he was</p>
<p>and he was just on</p>
<p>stage talking</p>
<p>about debbie gibson</p>
<p>and jimi hendrix and</p>
<p>just fucking people</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t buying it</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a couple times</p>
<p>where i saw him</p>
<p>where he absolutely destroyed though</p>
<p>one time at the old comedy</p>
<p>connection man</p>
<p>where he was just on his fucking game man</p>
<p>he just destroyed</p>
<p>just just came in</p>
<p>their guns blazed</p>
<p>all this shit</p>
<p>about jim fix</p>
<p>dying while jogging</p>
<p>and all that shit you know because</p>
<p>jim fix was the</p>
<p>jogging guy</p>
<p>yes and the eel brenner bit</p>
<p>you know he had yule brenner</p>
<p>yil brenner</p>
<p>you know jim fix</p>
<p>would get up and do we</p>
<p>track at dawn jogging and yule brenner</p>
<p>would be coming home and his</p>
<p>head out of the limousine two</p>
<p>chicks blowing them smoking a cigarette</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re both dead</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>you know he&rsquo;s dead and i&rsquo;m dead shit</p>
<p>i was fucking up at dawn doing yeah</p>
<p>i mean it was really</p>
<p>the only guy i saw from back then i saw dice clay</p>
<p>at the height</p>
<p>of i saw him at the worcester centrum</p>
<p>i sat of the</p>
<p>second to last row in the</p>
<p>upper deck eddie griffin</p>
<p>unknown eddie griffin opened up</p>

<p>go back to because</p>
<p>we both agree with this</p>
<p>about this and i&rsquo;ve talked</p>
<p>about this before is that hicks</p>
<p>or not in a hicks rather</p>
<p>kinesin was</p>
<p>genius in the beginning but then terrible at the end</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s my perfect example</p>
<p>of a guy that got famous</p>
<p>and he got huge and then he bought into his own hype</p>
<p>and then he became a character and he stopped writing</p>
<p>and he was doing</p>
<p>well i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think i&rsquo;ve ever seen a guy handle it</p>
<p>worse yeah me too</p>
<p>if you just</p>
<p>watch the difference between his</p>
<p>first and second lettermen</p>
<p>his first letterman like you know</p>
<p>they say that like you</p>
<p>know they give that intro like</p>
<p>jesus we don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>this next guy</p>
<p>this next guy is</p>
<p>gonna be different</p>
<p>we know there&rsquo;s that era of like something</p>
<p>crazy could fucking happen and usually it&rsquo;s just hype</p>
<p>will this guy&rsquo;s</p>
<p>crazy but it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s his act is he&rsquo;s crazy</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s like kennison it was real</p>
<p>and he came out dude i mean he</p>
<p>just fucking came out he was walking up into the crowd</p>
<p>and it wasn&rsquo;t cheesy it</p>
<p>was just it was</p>
<p>it was amazing and then</p>
<p>by his second one he comes in he just comes yeah</p>
<p>do you know that his</p>
<p>personality</p>
<p>was that game paul what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on and he just was just like too relaxed</p>
<p>two in yeah he was just like</p>
<p>i made it not hungry he just</p>
<p>said i made it yeah well</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s a fat guy</p>
<p>you know at the end of the day he&rsquo;s lazy</p>
<p>i mean that&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>true i mean fat people are fucking lazy</p>
<p>you know his</p>
<p>personality and his book his brother</p>
<p>built his brother</p>
<p>his brother&rsquo;s name forget his name i met him</p>
<p>unfortunately i forgot</p>
<p>his name whatever his name</p>
<p>is i&rsquo;m sorry</p>
<p>whoever you are sir taco</p>
<p>his brother who</p>
<p>wrote the book</p>
<p>wrote that he was</p>
<p>a normal kid and then he got hit by a fucking truck</p>
<p>he got hit by a car</p>
<p>and when he got hit by a car he got fucked up</p>
<p>and he came out of that</p>
<p>head injury</p>
<p>a completely different person</p>
<p>and then it became like reckless and fearless</p>
<p>and a fucking wild person like</p>
<p>the accident</p>
<p>literally made him sam kennisson</p>
<p>because you think</p>
<p>about him like</p>
<p>who the fuck</p>
<p>thinks like that</p>
<p>who has that kind of boldness to go on</p>
<p>stage and scream and yell</p>
<p>about things</p>
<p>you know and did</p>
<p>you ever see when he was preaching</p>
<p>you ever see the</p>
<p>videos of him preaching yeah</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s breaking a man he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>great holy shit</p>
<p>i mean it was so</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s like a rhythm</p>
<p>to someone preaching</p>
<p>when they believe</p>
<p>and the lord touches me</p>
<p>you like fuck i mean know</p>
<p>what i know what i&rsquo;m saying is</p>
<p>none of the applause break yeah</p>
<p>nobody knows how to</p>
<p>build they fucking</p>
<p>well that&rsquo;s why he was such a good</p>
<p>comic because he</p>
<p>would add those principles he</p>
<p>would draw it out like</p>
<p>ladies and gentlemen i know</p>
<p>the devil&rsquo;s in this room</p>
<p>and they would</p>
<p>oh yeah and he</p>
<p>would bring him down yeah yeah yeah the devil</p>
<p>would like you to believe</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>wrong with the lord</p>
<p>you know and he</p>
<p>starts walking back and forth and then it</p>
<p>builds up to this</p>
<p>but i&rsquo;m here to tell you</p>
<p>jesus is alive</p>
<p>jesus is with you</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s with and then everybody&rsquo;s fucking screaming</p>
<p>and i don&rsquo;t buy anything in it yet</p>
<p>shit but i love</p>
<p>watching preachers i watched a guy you know he&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>clearly a bigoted psychopath</p>
<p>but he was fucking a phenomenal performer</p>
<p>you know that guy he</p>
<p>would bring up people who like</p>
<p>you know who</p>
<p>were living like probably the life that we&rsquo;re living</p>
<p>and he had this</p>
<p>way of saying what they were doing and then he</p>
<p>would just sort of look to the side and</p>
<p>shake and he&rsquo;d</p>
<p>laugh every time i got</p>
<p>now he would read a</p>
<p>quote what somebody said</p>
<p>like you know this guy says premarital sex</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not a bad</p>
<p>thing it doesn&rsquo;t do anything for your soul it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t do anything bad to your soul right</p>
<p>and then he just had this look it was like carson</p>
<p>watching carson when he</p>
<p>would look over at the band he just had this</p>
<p>thing where he</p>
<p>would just sort of look down</p>
<p>and the crowd was just like</p>
<p>oh here he comes</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s gonna take the piss out of this guy</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like watching your favorite wrestling</p>
<p>here he goes here he goes and the guy</p>
<p>builds it all the way up and i</p>
<p>would just you know</p>
<p>and it was one of</p>
<p>those things</p>
<p>where i would actually</p>
<p>start getting into it like hey</p>
<p>maybe this guy&rsquo;s got a point</p>
<p>and then they</p>
<p>would just say something horrific</p>
<p>about gay people</p>
<p>or just something that just you just realize</p>
<p>how does an</p>
<p>adult think something like</p>
<p>that meanwhile he probably couldn&rsquo;t wait to get off</p>
<p>stage and fuck some kid</p>
<p>go to thailand</p>
<p>bang some kids i mean yeah</p>
<p>you know dude i got in this huge</p>
<p>thing with this fucking guy on the</p>
<p>internet like it&rsquo;s the last time i&rsquo;m getting with like</p>

<p>about how i said why i stopped</p>
<p>going to catholic church</p>
<p>and this guy was</p>
<p>upset at that</p>
<p>yeah and he bothered to</p>
<p>argue with that he was</p>
<p>cause i&rsquo;m an</p>
<p>idiot i come from a</p>
<p>you know i can&rsquo;t i take the fucking</p>

<p>around like this all the time this is what we do</p>
<p>and especially people that you know</p>
<p>especially if you live on the west</p>
<p>coast you never really</p>
<p>understand that sort of</p>
<p>sense of humor</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why people didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>understand the gilbert</p>
<p>gottfried thing</p>
<p>to me it was like you know when he</p>
<p>started tweeting</p>
<p>about japan i&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>so east coast</p>
<p>comic would do i mean you know you got it you</p>
<p>go for the jugular</p>
<p>thing yeah i didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>first of all</p>
<p>how many people</p>
<p>knew but high people</p>
<p>even knew he did the</p>
<p>voice of the duck</p>
<p>you know yeah yeah</p>
<p>who fucking</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just like that</p>
<p>classics apparently it&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>japanese people that were in</p>
<p>this insurance</p>
<p>company it&rsquo;s one of the reasons why i was busy</p>
<p>i always knew</p>
<p>did you hear</p>
<p>about this high profile</p>
<p>vegas drug prosecutor</p>
<p>this guy he busted</p>
<p>bruno mars he busted</p>
<p>paris hilton</p>
<p>on all the cocaine charges</p>
<p>he got arrested for buying crack</p>
<p>do you believe</p>
<p>that shame you must</p>
<p>know who you hang out with but i was thinking</p>
<p>about this when we were talking about you know</p>
<p>pedophiles and you know</p>
<p>all these fucking</p>
<p>crazy people that don&rsquo;t want to believe it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>how many people that</p>
<p>go against something really</p>
<p>want to do it</p>
<p>i mean how many fucking people like that</p>
<p>how many people</p>
<p>that are against gay like the ted haggards of the world</p>
<p>that are against gay marriage</p>
<p>against gay this against that</p>
<p>would say something like that yeah</p>
<p>yeah i remember that guy that got busted in new york</p>
<p>really recently he was a</p>
<p>a judge or something</p>
<p>like that he got busted in some sort of an</p>
<p>influence scandal</p>
<p>and it turns out that he was voting</p>
<p>against gay</p>
<p>marriage and he was fucking gay</p>
<p>you know the</p>
<p>guy&rsquo;s gay and he was living with a guy and he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>making all these votes</p>
<p>against gay</p>
<p>rights yeah</p>
<p>which goes back to religion if</p>
<p>they just let people live and be who the fuck they were</p>
<p>yeah you wouldn&rsquo;t have people</p>
<p>doing shit like that but as far as like the drugs</p>
<p>i think a lot of people</p>
<p>going after drugs that they</p>
<p>seriously are like</p>
<p>against them but i think</p>
<p>you know the</p>
<p>thing you gotta</p>
<p>watch out who you hang</p>
<p>out with because you end up doing what they&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>i think eventually</p>
<p>you just try it you think</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re in the evidence room</p>
<p>wow really you feel try</p>
<p>crack you&rsquo;re feeling a little</p>
<p>sleepy you could leave me</p>
<p>alone with buckets of</p>
<p>crack in my</p>
<p>house and i&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>gonna smoke it</p>
<p>yeah but you just</p>
<p>leave it all over the</p>
<p>place i&rsquo;m never</p>
<p>gonna touch the</p>
<p>crack i do it</p>
<p>this is what i would do</p>
<p>i leave you with booze</p>
<p>first get you when you like eleven you know</p>
<p>and we move the weed</p>
<p>is a develop</p>
<p>a human which is like a gateway drug</p>
<p>right you go to the weed</p>

<p>then it all depends on what you wanna feel</p>
<p>like for you i see why the way your</p>
<p>makeup you wanna feel</p>
<p>less smell like it</p>

<p>physically though physiologically it&rsquo;s not physically</p>
<p>okay whatever</p>
<p>psychological</p>
<p>whatever you</p>
<p>want to call it but like</p>
<p>those wake and bake guys yeah</p>
<p>those guy i got a</p>
<p>buddy of mine who</p>
<p>smokes weed because i said why do you</p>
<p>why do you like</p>
<p>dude anna seriously fucking with his life</p>
<p>and he keeps</p>
<p>going dude weed is not the</p>
<p>issue i go why</p>
<p>first of all why do you do it he goes</p>
<p>i like weed</p>
<p>cause it turns</p>
<p>my life into a movie</p>
<p>alright and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like this dude like i don&rsquo;t know i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>wanna fucking ran him out or nothing like that but</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s lost a job</p>
<p>cause he flunked a fucking drug test</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a shitty</p>
<p>job whatever</p>
<p>job that was that</p>
<p>job sucked okay any job that you can do that&rsquo;s boring</p>
<p>as fuck you can do on weed and it becomes interesting</p>
<p>you know no</p>
<p>no i&rsquo;m not saying</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s a bedroom i&rsquo;m saying but this guy he</p>
<p>gets fucking high</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>keeping life yeah he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>using it the way an</p>
<p>alky uses alcohol works just like i got all this pain</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>how to process it i don&rsquo;t want to deal with it</p>
<p>let me just let me just get fucked up</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s how he does it and dude i&rsquo;m telling</p>
<p>and the thing</p>
<p>about it the</p>
<p>thing about it is to with weed</p>
<p>is i can&rsquo;t go to work drunk</p>
<p>you know what i mean but</p>
<p>you can be high you can go to work</p>
<p>fucking high and as long as you can handle your shit</p>
<p>people aren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>gonna fucking notice</p>
<p>i like i just there&rsquo;s a bunch of</p>
<p>emails i got i got a guy go you know yeah i handle with</p>
<p>great just every night i</p>
<p>smoke a little fucking bowl</p>
<p>and then i go to bed</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just like what if i you know</p>
<p>drank a beer and a half two beers so i got buzzed</p>
<p>every fucking</p>
<p>night people</p>
<p>would be looking at me like dude i</p>
<p>think i think you have like a</p>
<p>drinking problem that you have to get he&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>sedating himself so he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>using it as like a fucking sleep aid</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not saying</p>
<p>and i but i don&rsquo;t have any problem with me i</p>
<p>think it makes you feel great</p>
<p>and that type</p>
<p>of shit it&rsquo;s just like anything as long in moderation</p>
<p>but people who sit there</p>
<p>it annoys me that on intervention they&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>never had just some pothead</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s been fucking high</p>
<p>since he&rsquo;s 16</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s still</p>
<p>watching like fucking the</p>
<p>hanna barbera hour</p>
<p>and you know</p>
<p>cause it doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>compare to the</p>
<p>meth guys pulling his face off with his fingernails</p>
<p>know that seems a lot worse</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the no</p>
<p>no that&rsquo;s definitely</p>
<p>worse but that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>then if you know meth heads they&rsquo;re the fucking</p>
<p>worst does that mean you shouldn&rsquo;t go after the</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s also a</p>
<p>difference between</p>
<p>not being in your normal</p>
<p>state you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>escaping your normal</p>
<p>self so even if you&rsquo;re wheat</p>
<p>stoned all day you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>escaping your sober</p>
<p>self your core</p>
<p>self which is always a problem in some ways</p>
<p>you know what i mean</p>
<p>does people go i</p>
<p>drive better when</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m high yeah</p>
<p>i know exactly what he&rsquo;s talking</p>
<p>about there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>so many people that we know that just wake</p>
<p>up from the beginning they wake up they have to get</p>
<p>stoned to go to bed</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>never their sober</p>
<p>self because</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re hiding something</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s all i&rsquo;m talking</p>
<p>about i&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>i agree a hundred percent i</p>
<p>think with the</p>
<p>vaporizer it&rsquo;s probably a thousand times</p>
<p>more healthier than</p>
<p>drinking a fucking six pack you know what</p>
<p>they all have in common</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re all fucking hilarious yeah</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the problem absolutely</p>
<p>listen when i was on fear factor i totally self</p>
<p>medicated i used to get high before every show</p>
<p>after the first</p>
<p>season i got high before</p>
<p>every fucking show</p>
<p>i was so bored</p>
<p>doing that show</p>
<p>i mean sometimes it was cool don&rsquo;t get me</p>
<p>wrong i&rsquo;m very</p>
<p>happy i had</p>
<p>the job it was a fucking wonderful opportunity</p>
<p>great people to work with</p>
<p>you know the producers and everyone was</p>
<p>the fucking the crew</p>
<p>fantastic it was just a wonderful job</p>
<p>but i would rather be doing other shit</p>
<p>you know yeah i wanted the</p>
<p>money and i wanted to do it and i was</p>
<p>gonna quit but man</p>
<p>you know at certain</p>
<p>points in time i mean how</p>
<p>many fucking animal dicks can you feed people before</p>
<p>you like what the fuck am i doing with my life</p>
<p>you know how many times can you hang somebody by a</p>
<p>crane and go ready</p>
<p>three two one go</p>
<p>right you know how many</p>
<p>think about you it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>you smoking weed</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t affect you</p>
<p>from prevent you</p>
<p>from fucking coming up with the new hour of material</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t prevent you it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t it helps you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>okay yeah and you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>slacking off and</p>
<p>slacking off and</p>
<p>sucking up your</p>
<p>motivation all right</p>
<p>so yeah i&rsquo;m not saying</p>
<p>like people just thought i was just straight across the</p>
<p>board saying it was bad i wasn&rsquo;t saying that</p>
<p>i was just saying like i just got sick of people going</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s not addicting</p>
<p>i drive better when i&rsquo;m high and like there was no</p>
<p>repercussions</p>
<p>yeah like there&rsquo;s repercussions to fucking</p>
<p>everything you know</p>
<p>especially if you&rsquo;re smoking that fucking</p>
<p>og kush that a lot of dudes like to</p>
<p>smoke that that indica</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s two different types of weed</p>
<p>sativa and indica</p>
<p>and the sativas</p>
<p>are like more heady like</p>
<p>you want to go</p>
<p>watch a documentary on space</p>
<p>and the indicas</p>
<p>you just want to</p>
<p>watch cartoons and eat cereal and sleep</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re two</p>
<p>really different</p>
<p>effects and most of the country only gets that weed</p>
<p>most of the country gets the</p>
<p>sleepy weed</p>
<p>they get the couch</p>
<p>weed you know what i</p>
<p>found lately that</p>
<p>sleepy weed&rsquo;s the best weed to have sex on that&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>ecstasy on weed</p>
<p>yeah that kind of makes sense yeah</p>
<p>well you know</p>
<p>what though the regular weed&rsquo;s pretty awesome too</p>
<p>yeah you know what&rsquo;s the best for sex eating weed</p>
<p>when you eat weed you get that body buzz</p>
<p>you get that because</p>
<p>it really affects you in</p>
<p>a different way because it&rsquo;s a different chemical when</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s processed by your liver and</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the best for sex</p>
<p>like everything</p>
<p>feels better i</p>
<p>watched the</p>
<p>oscars and it was like the best</p>
<p>oscars i had</p>
<p>was i heard</p>
<p>that there was some bad monologue or something i didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t watch any of that nonsense i</p>
<p>think people awards</p>
<p>are ridiculous was the moment</p>
<p>james franco you</p>
<p>could just see tapped i was just like i fuck this</p>
<p>yeah i came out</p>
<p>in a dress and you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>gonna laugh at me go fuck yourself</p>
<p>and just had this look on his face i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna keep working who gives a fuck it was great</p>
<p>he starts taking his</p>
<p>phone out and starts</p>
<p>checking it</p>
<p>was like a comedian</p>
<p>when you just look at a</p>
<p>crowd and he&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>these people are fucking</p>
<p>idiots well how</p>
<p>about those shitheads that got upset at</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s his name the english guy</p>
<p>there was breaking</p>
<p>gervais yeah it was doing the golden</p>
<p>globes they got</p>
<p>upset at him because he was i</p>
<p>thought that that</p>
<p>was funny but i didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think he deserved any sort of</p>
<p>edgy points</p>
<p>i mean it&rsquo;s like you show up</p>
<p>and you have a</p>
<p>staff of writers</p>
<p>write roast jokes and you</p>
<p>took to like yeah cause</p>
<p>everything was</p>
<p>like it was</p>
<p>this amazing fucking can you believe you know</p>
<p>you fucking get a</p>
<p>staff of writers to write</p>
<p>roast jokes to</p>
<p>sling them at people</p>
<p>armed with acceptance speeches</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like and then what you do go down and fucking</p>
<p>start slapping around some</p>
<p>first graders</p>
<p>i just think that that&rsquo;s a gig</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s really easy to come off as edgy</p>
<p>i mean people are</p>
<p>gasping and what was he doing a</p>
<p>robert downey jr rehab joke</p>
<p>it goes back to that hick</p>
<p>shit that you were talking</p>
<p>about it&rsquo;s just like</p>
<p>i thought it was really like</p>
<p>like i just look at that gig well</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like the comic</p>
<p>where you get like a</p>
<p>corporate gig</p>
<p>and they go listen don&rsquo;t talk</p>
<p>about this don&rsquo;t talk</p>
<p>about this and work</p>
<p>clean okay and you</p>
<p>agree to it</p>
<p>and then you go out there</p>
<p>and then you just say</p>
<p>fucking blah blah blah</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re walking around like you&rsquo;re fucking lenny</p>
<p>bruce you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just a douche</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just a douche</p>
<p>if you didn&rsquo;t want to do the gig</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t like celebrities you</p>
<p>think they fucking suck</p>
<p>what are you doing at an award show with a fucking</p>
<p>tuxedo one greg fitzsimmons was telling me a</p>
<p>story about a gig that he did in new hampshire</p>
<p>you had to drive up there it&rsquo;s like fucking four</p>
<p>hours in the middle of nowhere</p>
<p>and he did the gig</p>
<p>and they told him whatever you do you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>swear don&rsquo;t say fuck</p>
<p>so he goes on</p>
<p>stage he goes</p>
<p>apparently i&rsquo;m not supposed to say fuck</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s out about</p>
<p>he gets off stage</p>
<p>they have his bags packed</p>
<p>like right there by the side she</p>
<p>get the fuck out of here you&rsquo;re fired</p>
<p>and so he has to</p>
<p>drive home and and you know he was telling it to rich</p>
<p>sliceler actually</p>
<p>and slicers like they let you</p>
<p>drive home at</p>
<p>night usually they tell you to</p>
<p>never drive at</p>
<p>night because there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>moose up there</p>
<p>like fuck this kid</p>
<p>he said the evil word</p>
<p>but yeah that&rsquo;s a douche but that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>thing you do when you&rsquo;re 20 you know you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>yeah and you</p>
<p>think you&rsquo;re like yeah</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s how</p>
<p>i always viewed it i viewed it like because</p>
<p>i went through that period but i sort of viewed it like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like they&rsquo;re telling you what they want</p>
<p>and they hire you</p>
<p>to do this and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>agreeing to</p>
<p>fight it&rsquo;s like that fucking kid at</p>
<p>byu everybody&rsquo;s</p>
<p>flipping out</p>
<p>like he had sex and they kick him off team</p>
<p>they said what they</p>
<p>expected and you signed a fucking contract</p>
<p>you know don&rsquo;t go to the</p>
<p>school yeah but the idea of stopping</p>
<p>teenagers for fucking it&rsquo;s just like saying don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>drink water is</p>
<p>ridiculous i&rsquo;m not saying it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>smart i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>agree with it i</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s fucking</p>
<p>ridiculous but</p>
<p>who in their</p>
<p>right fucking mind signs a contract</p>
<p>and says i&rsquo;m not i&rsquo;m not gonna fuck</p>
<p>that had to</p>
<p>have been all written up back in the fucking dark ages</p>
<p>though right it</p>
<p>was in brigham</p>
<p>young university that&rsquo;s a mormon university</p>
<p>right i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>agree with it but it&rsquo;s one of</p>
<p>those things don&rsquo;t take the gig</p>
<p>you telling me that guy couldn&rsquo;t put a ball</p>
<p>through a hoop in someplace else yeah but it&rsquo;s not like</p>
<p>byu is fucking</p>
<p>north carolina</p>
<p>or some really like you know</p>
<p>traditional</p>
<p>like where all</p>
<p>these like jordans and</p>
<p>james worthies came from</p>
<p>byu is like the best they got</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve had a couple of</p>
<p>seasons with like</p>
<p>steve young and</p>
<p>jim mcmahon</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve had like great</p>
<p>great teams with</p>
<p>their football</p>
<p>but now with</p>
<p>basketball it&rsquo;s fucking byu i</p>
<p>have no idea what you&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about now you lost man</p>
<p>all right but you know what you listeners</p>
<p>right do they know you</p>
<p>sort of sports for</p>
<p>fucking losers out there</p>
<p>all right it would be like i&rsquo;m kidding i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think you&rsquo;re a loser if you like basketball right</p>
<p>settle down</p>
<p>put your panties</p>
<p>straighten them out see this is people</p>
<p>people online</p>
<p>with that talking about them not you</p>
<p>talking about those people out there and you just get</p>
<p>upset because i cuz i</p>
<p>said you&rsquo;re a fucking loser if you like</p>
<p>basketball and then i&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>relax everybody on twitter i&rsquo;m just joking around</p>
<p>these are just jokes</p>
<p>these are just jokes hey did you see gallagher</p>
<p>i heard that he fucked and</p>
<p>got a stroke on</p>
<p>stage right no i saw he was on the</p>
<p>local news one of the saddest fucking</p>
<p>things i&rsquo;ve ever seen he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>standing outside of his house that he somehow owed</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s owned for 30 years</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s having an auction</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s selling all half the shit you&rsquo;ve seen in a special</p>
<p>what he&rsquo;s selling</p>
<p>these off cause he&rsquo;s losing his house</p>
<p>jake i&rsquo;m telling you</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m telling you</p>
<p>right now they&rsquo;re on fucking tv talking</p>
<p>about barry bonds</p>
<p>and roger clements</p>
<p>and what they you know what baseball</p>
<p>they should be hunting down</p>
<p>these bankers and fucking</p>
<p>shooting in between the eyes</p>
<p>i need to own a</p>
<p>house for 30 years</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re getting</p>
<p>kicked out of it i thought it&rsquo;s a 30 year loan</p>
<p>well he probably didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>pay his loan</p>
<p>but you know</p>
<p>he protects</p>
<p>second mortgages and probably didn&rsquo;t pay it</p>
<p>i didn&rsquo;t hear that he got</p>
<p>getting kicked out of his</p>
<p>house though i was like selling</p>
<p>large bananas but he just had a fucking</p>
<p>heart attack on stage</p>
<p>dude i don&rsquo;t get how you&rsquo;re in a fucking</p>
<p>house for thirty years</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re doing road gigs</p>
<p>and you somehow can&rsquo;t afford to keep your fucking house</p>
<p>dude those mortgages it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>modern day fucking slavery</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s ridiculous</p>
<p>right but that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>but how can you say that when you say that a kid</p>
<p>should be able to go to brigham young</p>
<p>and sign a contract that he&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>gonna fuck you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think that it&rsquo;s just as</p>
<p>ridiculous that someone</p>
<p>signed this contract for a</p>
<p>second mortgage and</p>
<p>this is why they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>agreeing to that</p>
<p>because you can&rsquo;t live outside</p>
<p>huh well you&rsquo;re a fucking</p>
<p>idiot you&rsquo;re an</p>
<p>idiot man if</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re homeless you better have some friends</p>
<p>sleep on the</p>
<p>couch you&rsquo;re the</p>
<p>dummy who wants to take out a</p>
<p>second mortgage and you</p>
<p>think you can</p>
<p>pay it off i mean it&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>agreement it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not dealing</p>
<p>with a lone</p>
<p>shark who i</p>
<p>completely disagree with really</p>
<p>because i feel like</p>
<p>first of all it</p>
<p>should take you 30 fucking</p>
<p>years to pay the</p>
<p>thing off didn&rsquo;t take bill gates</p>
<p>thirty years you</p>
<p>shouldn&rsquo;t take</p>
<p>donald trump</p>
<p>thirty years is a lot of people that play this</p>
<p>capitalism game</p>
<p>they figured out a way to do it and this guy didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>he didn&rsquo;t pay his fucking bills</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s that simple organic</p>
<p>or something</p>
<p>crazy organic</p>
<p>watermelons</p>
<p>maybe something happened i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>about forget it right</p>
<p>no it&rsquo;s just how the game is set up dude</p>
<p>banks and insurance companies are the two most</p>
<p>crooked motherfuckers out there yes i</p>
<p>agree and as you get older</p>
<p>you start having health fucking problems</p>
<p>and you have a little</p>
<p>heart attack and</p>
<p>then you got you know you get hospital bills do they</p>
<p>look this is what the deal they want you to run on the</p>
<p>wheel for thirty</p>
<p>years and then they want you to fuck up financially</p>
<p>so they can kick you out and</p>
<p>stick somebody else</p>
<p>listen to what you&rsquo;re saying you are</p>
<p>right now doing</p>
<p>exactly what you say you hate comedians doing</p>
<p>they want you to do this and they want you to do that</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just the same as we</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the same</p>
<p>thing notice</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re making this them what you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing is you&rsquo;re being like the guy who sent me the</p>
<p>email and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>defending pedophiles in a financial way</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not defending them at all you&rsquo;re saying look i</p>
<p>think the system is</p>
<p>completely fucked up and</p>
<p>a lot more people</p>
<p>should be in jail</p>
<p>than burning</p>
<p>it off i think that they</p>
<p>should fucking</p>
<p>front end load the interest</p>
<p>i think gallagher made millions of dollars</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what i</p>
<p>think and i</p>
<p>think if gallagher lost his</p>
<p>house he&rsquo;s probably a fucking idiot</p>
<p>absolutely and then i</p>
<p>heard gallagher</p>
<p>on the marin</p>
<p>podcast like running off and i&rsquo;ve seen gallagher on</p>
<p>opie and anthony he&rsquo;s a douchebag all those</p>
<p>stupid jokes she was trying to play on patrice</p>
<p>this is the thing</p>
<p>this is what i can&rsquo;t stand</p>
<p>about this shit is gallagher&rsquo;s the douchebag</p>
<p>but what about the fucking bankers</p>
<p>do that made homeless guys qualified to get a fucking</p>
<p>home okay but</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a different argument they</p>
<p>drive we were talking</p>
<p>about gallagher</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m never gonna</p>
<p>defend bankers</p>
<p>gallagher i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>never gonna defend</p>
<p>gallag or bankers</p>
<p>or gallagher fuck gallagher</p>
<p>obviously i don&rsquo;t know the guy&rsquo;s finances</p>
<p>shit it just</p>
<p>any chance i</p>
<p>had to take a shot at fucking bankers have you</p>
<p>seen inside</p>
<p>job yet it&rsquo;s on a</p>
<p>warp crisis</p>
<p>i just got it and i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna watch it tonight i was</p>
<p>gonna watch it last</p>
<p>night but i&rsquo;m trying to fix my pool</p>
<p>stroke a guy</p>
<p>named stevie moore told me my</p>
<p>elbow comes up in a</p>
<p>funny way i</p>

<p>you don&rsquo;t want a girl beating you that&rsquo;s a very</p>
<p>masculine game</p>
<p>i know guys that</p>
<p>when i would play in tournaments</p>
<p>they would have to play</p>
<p>women they would freeze up</p>
<p>even good pro players</p>

<p>cause they don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>wanna lose to a chick</p>

<p>bench pressing more than you she</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t matter she&rsquo;s playing</p>
<p>ball into a hole pool is a very manly game cause it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>about controlling your instincts</p>
<p>and controlling your emotions and staying calm and</p>
<p>focused and showing that you can fire</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>under pressure</p>
<p>pool the big thing</p>
<p>about pool is not playing for fun</p>
<p>the big thing</p>
<p>about pools gambling</p>

<p>what pool means i think</p>
<p>pool halls are manly</p>
<p>well what pool means</p>
<p>is pull the</p>
<p>money in and gamble</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what it was</p>
<p>invented i mean that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>literally the name the origins of the name pool</p>
<p>the game is pocket billiards that&rsquo;s the real game</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s called pool because you fucking gamble on it</p>
<p>and when guys are gambling man last</p>
<p>thing you want to do is lose</p>
<p>money to a chick in a game</p>
<p>when you dog the ball you</p>
<p>panic and you think you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t miss this nine ball this is it this is</p>
<p>everything put</p>

<p>devastated that she was beating me in a sit up contest</p>
<p>i was super</p>
<p>upset people were 11</p>

<p>some people don&rsquo;t mature</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what i&rsquo;m saying some guys it just</p>
<p>look i&rsquo;ve lost to girls in tournaments before</p>
<p>and i didn&rsquo;t enjoy it</p>
<p>back when i was like in my</p>
<p>early 20s i didn&rsquo;t like it at all</p>
<p>playing some fucking i</p>
<p>can lose to a woman</p>
<p>in anything</p>
<p>other than an argument if i lost in an argument that</p>
<p>would fucking kill me</p>
<p>like really</p>

<p>thing with me if i&rsquo;m wrong</p>
<p>i admit i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>wrong in a relationship you</p>

<p>and that will</p>
<p>save it dude you just had a little help a lot</p>
<p>you know what</p>

<p>flipped out</p>
<p>i shouldn&rsquo;t have yelled at that guy you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>right blah blah</p>
<p>whatever and it shows</p>
<p>it shows like a willingness to grow</p>
<p>and honesty and</p>
<p>things that people</p>
<p>appreciate i</p>
<p>appreciate that in friendships too</p>
<p>when a friend will come out to</p>
<p>me dude i shouldn&rsquo;t have said that to you i&rsquo;m sorry i</p>
<p>appreciate that i&rsquo;m just talking</p>
<p>about strangers you don&rsquo;t give a shit and you get right</p>
<p>fuck you fuck you back</p>
<p>if they actually</p>
<p>if they actually</p>
<p>like i had a victory and then turned it into a loss</p>
<p>about fucking</p>
<p>about a month ago</p>
<p>i was sitting in my car i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>doing this phoner</p>
<p>this meeting</p>
<p>right and i&rsquo;m outside the bank right</p>
<p>and this girl pulls up</p>
<p>gets out of a car opens her car door</p>
<p>right into my door</p>
<p>boom hits it</p>
<p>and like but didn&rsquo;t even react</p>
<p>may not like really hard</p>
<p>hard enough</p>
<p>but it was the fact that she didn&rsquo;t fucking react</p>
<p>that i actually question i&rsquo;m like did she just</p>
<p>maybe i don&rsquo;t know is it</p>
<p>maybe i i thought she did it whatever</p>
<p>right so i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>still on the phone</p>
<p>doing this conference call right</p>
<p>she fucking comes back out she does it again</p>
<p>so i&rsquo;m on comp</p>
<p>i got these people on</p>
<p>speaker fuck that</p>
<p>noise so i said hang on a second</p>
<p>i opened the door i said hey</p>
<p>i go you just opened your car door into my car</p>
<p>on the way into the bank</p>
<p>and on the way out of the bank</p>
<p>and she goes oh i didn&rsquo;t chip the paint</p>
<p>i go chip to</p>
<p>paint you didn&rsquo;t even look</p>
<p>why don&rsquo;t you</p>
<p>be a little more considerate next time and i</p>
<p>slammed the door so i won</p>
<p>game set fucking match</p>
<p>and then like an</p>
<p>idiot i still had to look over at her</p>
<p>and she just goes smile</p>
<p>have a nice day like i&rsquo;m an asshole for getting upset</p>
<p>and then she gave me the finger and</p>
<p>drove away so</p>
<p>she kinda she</p>
<p>kinda she kinda</p>
<p>she kind of</p>
<p>stole the round on me it&rsquo;s like i won and i got one</p>
<p>sugary lemon</p>
<p>and then yeah yeah</p>
<p>like when you</p>
<p>she fought haggle</p>
<p>haggard won that fucking</p>
<p>fight by the way she did win that fight she</p>
<p>went with the little fucking american flag shows brrr</p>
<p>to the side of my head and i was like fuck</p>
<p>why did i look at her i</p>
<p>should just</p>
<p>be like be a little more considerate</p>
<p>i had the slam of the door at</p>
<p>everything you know the conspiracy on that fight</p>
<p>is that haggard threw it</p>
<p>and then hagler</p>
<p>could have knocked out</p>
<p>leonard but he was hitting them with pity pat punches</p>
<p>which if you</p>
<p>watch it it really</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t look like the same kind of punches he</p>
<p>threw on mugabe and herns</p>
<p>it looks like he was like</p>
<p>almost three quarter</p>
<p>speeding his</p>
<p>punches really</p>
<p>cause that guy</p>
<p>generally looked devastated</p>
<p>when he lost</p>
<p>when he said</p>
<p>this is why i</p>
<p>should have</p>
<p>never fought in vegas</p>
<p>maybe i mean</p>
<p>but he retired</p>
<p>it was a close enough</p>
<p>fight that he</p>
<p>could have lost a decision he retired</p>
<p>if he doesn&rsquo;t see it that way it&rsquo;s his ego</p>
<p>cause it was pretty</p>
<p>close you can</p>
<p>see decisions are squirrelly anything can happen</p>
<p>judges don&rsquo;t have monitors no he didn&rsquo;t no one got</p>
<p>knocked down that</p>
<p>fight i thought he</p>
<p>knocked them down i don&rsquo;t believe so</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t think so i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think hagriber</p>
<p>knocked down leonard</p>
<p>hold on he didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>knock him down maybe i&rsquo;m thinking one of his older</p>
<p>fights that was the worst watching</p>
<p>leonard out when haggard</p>
<p>knocked guys down they really usually didn&rsquo;t get up</p>
<p>dude how great was the middleweight division</p>
<p>but what i was saying is it was</p>
<p>amazing but what i was saying is that</p>
<p>he sent her no</p>
<p>no i don&rsquo;t think he knocked him down</p>
<p>what was saying is though that he retired and he</p>
<p>moved to italy</p>
<p>and he became a fucking movie star</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like look if the imam</p>
<p>really wanted to bet a shitload of money</p>
<p>on the underdog</p>
<p>which is sugar ray leonard</p>
<p>fighting this destroyer whose marvin haggard just</p>
<p>fucking crush</p>
<p>tommy herns was knocking everybody senseless</p>
<p>and sugary leonard hadn&rsquo;t fought in years</p>
<p>you know he&rsquo;s older he</p>
<p>looked like</p>
<p>people didn&rsquo;t ever</p>
<p>think anybody ever came back and was successful</p>
<p>because most of the time they weren&rsquo;t i thought</p>
<p>he did it he looked like he did a</p>
<p>cycle before that</p>
<p>fight he was funny leonard did yeah he was huge</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t tommy hearns accuse him of that</p>
<p>tommy hearns accused him of that before</p>
<p>their second fight</p>
<p>oh leonard yeah dude no</p>
<p>when he won that</p>
<p>fight and he did the classic</p>
<p>flex dude he was like you know that guy you know</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know you know who they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going after is</p>
<p>lance armstrong</p>
<p>ooh they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going after him man</p>
<p>him and barry</p>
<p>bond they&rsquo;ve been going</p>
<p>after him forever</p>
<p>yeah but they got a lot</p>
<p>in they got a lot in</p>
<p>the bankers fuck no</p>
<p>no they gotta stop we</p>
<p>gotta stop martha</p>
<p>stewart we gotta</p>
<p>stop we gotta stop</p>
<p>roger clements this is just it&rsquo;s just fodder</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s true it&rsquo;s true you&rsquo;re totally</p>
<p>right it&rsquo;s good</p>
<p>point yeah it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>kinda crazy</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not that it&rsquo;s not that it&rsquo;s baseball it&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>baseball represents well it&rsquo;s like what the fucking</p>
<p>bankers that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t represent</p>
<p>that is our</p>
<p>money people losing</p>
<p>their houses a lot</p>
<p>worse than someone</p>
<p>losing a fucking baseball game no just bothers</p>
<p>me every week that i work</p>
<p>and then i go it&rsquo;s just everybody works</p>
<p>and you go and you just give</p>
<p>these cunts your money</p>
<p>you hand it over like a fucking child</p>
<p>like a child</p>
<p>well here&rsquo;s even</p>
<p>worse what the fuck does</p>
<p>money even mean anymore</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not even backed up by anything that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just based on</p>
<p>confidence a</p>
<p>piece of paper</p>
<p>that used to be</p>
<p>what you could</p>
<p>claim gold that you</p>
<p>could no longer</p>
<p>claim the gold for the most maddening</p>
<p>thing to me is</p>
<p>these people that used to work for the sec</p>
<p>used to be investigating</p>
<p>these big companies and then when they retire</p>
<p>they get huge jobs inside</p>
<p>these companies</p>
<p>like how the fuck is that legal</p>
<p>how is that allowed how do you let people profit</p>
<p>off of the fact that they</p>
<p>build some sort of a relationship with</p>
<p>these big fucking financial institutions that are</p>
<p>raping the public and taking all this buy out</p>
<p>money and paying off</p>
<p>their fucking executives</p>
<p>giant bonuses</p>
<p>while they lost billions</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re paying</p>
<p>these guys 40 million 30 million like what is</p>

<p>look at the dog</p>
<p>and be like wow</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s cause a</p>
<p>trickle down effect</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like what was happening to us as kids</p>
<p>we did to each other and</p>
<p>then everybody did it to the fucking dog so when</p>
<p>i bought this</p>
<p>house this house was</p>
<p>i gotta be careful how i say this</p>
<p>cause they were nice people</p>
<p>but the woman</p>
<p>was very hot</p>
<p>and a little bit older but</p>
<p>still hot like in a milf way</p>
<p>but super controlling and the man was</p>
<p>this sort of a meek guy who happened to be rich</p>
<p>and the woman had</p>
<p>these fucking dogs</p>
<p>and this woman was a mean lady she was and</p>
<p>she would yell at her husband in</p>
<p>front of us</p>
<p>and she had</p>
<p>these dogs that</p>
<p>which fucking snap at everybody</p>
<p>they would bite people they bit like</p>
<p>three different people and then growl at people</p>
<p>and i grew up</p>
<p>with dogs i grew up with pit bulls pit bulls my my</p>
<p>whole life i had</p>
<p>crazy dogs so i saw</p>
<p>these dogs and</p>
<p>they came running up to me like when i was in the house</p>
<p>and the dogs got</p>
<p>right up to him</p>
<p>and what&rsquo;s going on guys</p>
<p>someone gave my hand</p>
<p>and then she goes</p>
<p>this is incredible they don&rsquo;t let anyone</p>
<p>touch them they</p>
<p>would tear your</p>
<p>throat out by this time</p>
<p>great owner</p>
<p>great owner what</p>
<p>the fuck is</p>
<p>wrong with you you got these</p>
<p>crazy animals living you that want to tear people&rsquo;s</p>

<p>you come into my</p>
<p>house let some come up to you yeah you</p>
<p>come to my house</p>
<p>and i go hey there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>say hi johnny johnny will come</p>
<p>over wagging his tail you pet him he&rsquo;ll kiss your face</p>
<p>this he recognizes you as a friend you&rsquo;re in this</p>
<p>group of nice people</p>
<p>the fuck is</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s an indicative of a creepy person</p>
<p>right right a</p>
<p>scary dog i was just</p>
<p>fucking wound up</p>
<p>so the dog they feed off the fucking energy so the dog</p>
<p>started getting</p>
<p>wound up and then it</p>
<p>started growling at people on the street</p>
<p>and then i got nervous</p>
<p>so then the dog would</p>
<p>sense my nervousness</p>
<p>would growl a little bit fucking more</p>
<p>and it just</p>
<p>built and then i</p>
<p>would be terrified walking down the</p>
<p>street with the</p>
<p>thing and the dog</p>
<p>and then the meanwhile</p>
<p>is the dog can come up on the</p>
<p>couch whenever it wants it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>sort of running shit and i didn&rsquo;t know any of that shit</p>
<p>but so we undid all of that</p>
<p>now the dog is totally fucking cool people</p>
<p>come over it&rsquo;s wagging its tail and all had to do</p>
<p>with the way you were playing with my energy the</p>
<p>i mean no i didn&rsquo;t do any of that</p>
<p>rough housing with the dog</p>
<p>but the joke i&rsquo;ve been doing in my act is even if you</p>
<p>roughhouse with the dog</p>
<p>you gotta bring</p>
<p>their energy back down to being chill</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t have them at this heightened</p>
<p>fucking thing</p>
<p>right and then walk outside</p>
<p>cause they&rsquo;re fucking</p>
<p>especially like</p>
<p>pit bulls the</p>
<p>thing if you own one</p>
<p>you have to</p>
<p>address the fact that you fucking own a dangerous</p>
<p>breed because</p>
<p>people just</p>
<p>sit no she&rsquo;s the most lovable blah blah blah blah blah</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like yeah and also has</p>
<p>ability to rip somebody&rsquo;s face off so i was having like</p>
<p>panic attacks</p>
<p>if this thing ever bit somebody and called like</p>
<p>nerve damage or</p>
<p>fucked up their face</p>
<p>i mean beyond beyond</p>
<p>beyond getting sued</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the level of</p>
<p>guilt i woulda had so</p>
<p>you know i knew</p>
<p>you know a couple people had</p>
<p>pit bulls and i took him to this guy and he just did a</p>
<p>great job but it was</p>
<p>literally it was six fucking</p>
<p>months of in your</p>
<p>house or did they</p>
<p>no no he took the dog</p>
<p>first he took the dog for six</p>
<p>months and you get it back a half a year later</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s awesome</p>
<p>shocking that&rsquo;s awesome no</p>
<p>he had it for like a</p>
<p>month no he had it for a</p>
<p>month tie an</p>
<p>electrode the same shit they did to dana</p>
<p>diorama putting</p>
<p>electrodes in</p>
<p>his asshole</p>
<p>no no he had it for a fucking month a</p>
<p>whole month yes</p>
<p>great he has it for a</p>
<p>month well cause you gotta</p>
<p>chill the fuck out</p>
<p>cause i got this cost</p>
<p>yeah it wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>cheap okay anyway but it was way cheaper</p>
<p>than getting the living shit suit out of me and being</p>
<p>guilt and filling the guilt</p>
<p>so we went through all of that bullshit</p>
<p>and now the dog is just like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s cool as hell so he just</p>
<p>trains it all day every day</p>
<p>no it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>well the funny</p>
<p>thing is it&rsquo;s like the dog</p>
<p>the second he&rsquo;s around him</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re removed from the equation</p>
<p>it goes back</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s chill and he&rsquo;s in control it instantly</p>
<p>was fine the dog was instantly</p>
<p>that the problem was us</p>
<p>we didn&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>and now we were all fucking scared anytime you</p>
<p>would come over all</p>
<p>right dude just blah blah</p>
<p>and everything i was doing was fucking wrong and</p>
<p>it just kept</p>
<p>building the</p>
<p>experience which</p>
<p>would add to my paranoia</p>
<p>so it just became a really bad situation but the</p>
<p>second he went over with him</p>
<p>you know it was fine he was walking it with dogs</p>
<p>everything was cool</p>
<p>he had to learn like</p>
<p>cause he was walking into a totally new environment</p>
<p>new set of rules</p>
<p>we were gone</p>
<p>it didn&rsquo;t feel like</p>
<p>it had to protect anybody so the dog was instantly fine</p>
<p>what he had to do</p>
<p>was undo us it had nothing to do with the dog it was us</p>
<p>for and the reason why i took six</p>
<p>months was because i&rsquo;m on the road</p>
<p>every other fucking week</p>
<p>was like the</p>
<p>whole family grew from that</p>
<p>experience i</p>
<p>think so i think i</p>
<p>grew from hearing it</p>
<p>it was awesome</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very romantic</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s good that there&rsquo;s someone out there that</p>
<p>can do that man because there&rsquo;s a lot of people that</p>
<p>would i wish it was cheaper</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a lot of people with fucking dangerous dogs</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a guy that lives down the</p>
<p>street from me as pit bulls are always out</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>yeah they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>nice they&rsquo;re friendly like get the fuck out of here man</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve had pit bulls i&rsquo;ve had a</p>
<p>bunch of them they don&rsquo;t like</p>
<p>other dogs if somebody else&rsquo;s dogs lose too</p>
<p>likely you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna have a dead dog in the</p>
<p>street it depends</p>
<p>on it really depends on</p>
<p>like if we wanted to get another dog we</p>
<p>would have to</p>
<p>ours is a female we&rsquo;d have to get a male</p>
<p>and you have to get a</p>
<p>puppy so they</p>
<p>would have a mother yep</p>
<p>relationship yeah absolutely</p>
<p>right you do it that way you don&rsquo;t you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>bring in another female</p>
<p>yeah like my dog just its personality</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not the kind of dog that you want to walk with</p>
<p>other dogs very</p>
<p>possessive very</p>
<p>jealous so it&rsquo;s something you have to keep in</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;re just like people they have different</p>
<p>personality</p>
<p>where i&rsquo;m fucking a</p>
<p>wound up psycho</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s another guy who&rsquo;s just totally fucking</p>
<p>chill and wouldn&rsquo;t have had a problem</p>
<p>with the dog</p>
<p>right the dog</p>
<p>would have become a</p>
<p>chill dog yeah</p>
<p>yeah dude they do that show you</p>
<p>watching a game and some</p>
<p>man what dude what the fuck</p>
<p>and then like</p>
<p>their ears come up like yeah dude what the fuck</p>
<p>you know they stop</p>
<p>getting into that mode</p>
<p>and then if you have a dog that&rsquo;s you know bred to</p>
<p>fight in a pit</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s ready to go yeah</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s amazing that you</p>
<p>could just buy that and then people i mean they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>great dogs they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>super friendly and</p>
<p>super sweet</p>
<p>now it&rsquo;s ridiculous that you can go down to a shelter</p>
<p>and they just it&rsquo;s like just giving somebody</p>
<p>a gun you don&rsquo;t even know what end of the bullet</p>
<p>comes more than a gun it&rsquo;s like giving him a monster</p>
<p>yeah so giving him a wild</p>
<p>monster that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be your</p>
<p>buddy you know</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>speak english</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t even tell them listen you can&rsquo;t eat kids</p>
<p>getting fucking dog shit you</p>
<p>understand listen</p>
<p>i have a backcount</p>
<p>this is how you dog</p>
<p>how about this</p>
<p>you shouldn&rsquo;t fucking kill people</p>
<p>be a nice doggy you know</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the end</p>
<p>the end of the fucking show</p>
<p>dude i can&rsquo;t believe</p>
<p>this be careful</p>
<p>pit bulls two</p>
<p>hours two and a half</p>
<p>hours we went on for a long time</p>
<p>but you know what it&rsquo;s always</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s always fun to</p>
<p>have you on bro you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re hilarious you know what</p>
<p>i didn&rsquo;t even hype</p>
<p>is means the</p>
<p>buddies of mine made a</p>
<p>short film when we just got into the tribeca</p>
<p>film festival</p>
<p>really was it called</p>
<p>cheat cheat</p>
<p>yeah what&rsquo;s it about</p>
<p>me joe de rosa and robert</p>
<p>kelly joe oh</p>
<p>bobby kelly</p>
<p>asked me to</p>
<p>write an article</p>
<p>yeah or rather</p>
<p>a chapter because</p>
<p>i guess you guys are gonna do a book on it no that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>something to go along</p>
<p>with it yeah the book came out of that yeah yeah</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s been this great thing so you know we</p>
<p>wrote it and shot it ourselves</p>
<p>about a year ago and finally you know</p>
<p>started submitting it to a festival so we&rsquo;re in that</p>
<p>thing so we&rsquo;re really excited</p>
<p>about it nice so when can people see it</p>
<p>well they can see it at the festival</p>
<p>if you live anywhere around there</p>
<p>but then after where&rsquo;s that</p>
<p>where&rsquo;s it where&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the film festival is in</p>
<p>tribeca new york and manhattan</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;ll be a i think it&rsquo;s april</p>
<p>20th through like may 3rd</p>
<p>and then afterwards will be available for dvd</p>
<p>or what you gonna try to get it</p>
<p>we haven&rsquo;t got to that</p>
<p>point yet yeah i don&rsquo;t know how that works this is the</p>
<p>first thing we&rsquo;ve ever done so how many minutes is it</p>
<p>like 15 15 film so do you think you would put it online</p>
<p>and have it available online or how</p>
<p>would what would you do afterwards i have no idea</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s cool</p>
<p>what would started this just guys start talking and</p>
<p>yeah i don&rsquo;t want to give away like</p>
<p>okay i don&rsquo;t want to give away the</p>
<p>movie but basically it was one of</p>
<p>those deals where it was like three comedians</p>
<p>sitting around there was a fucking problem</p>
<p>and we just</p>
<p>started brainstorming</p>
<p>on it and somebody was like dude this is a movie</p>
<p>and then we</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know we just fucking sat down and</p>
<p>wrote it and then</p>
<p>it was awesome yeah it was really cool</p>
<p>now it was one</p>
<p>of the best times i ever had because we just put the</p>
<p>money up ourselves and shot it ourselves and afterwards</p>
<p>we were trying to figure out why we had such a</p>
<p>great fucking time</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like oh yeah there was no industry going</p>
<p>why doesn&rsquo;t he wear like a red</p>
<p>shirt in this</p>
<p>and he can be like a</p>
<p>plumber well</p>
<p>you were there for the chappelle show</p>
<p>did you get to</p>
<p>experience any of them you were</p>
<p>a regular on that show right i no</p>
<p>i wasn&rsquo;t on the second</p>
<p>season i was</p>
<p>becoming a regular i only did five sketches but i just</p>
<p>ended up being in five of the huge ones</p>
<p>the racial draft the</p>
<p>world series of dice</p>
<p>even like the</p>
<p>sam jackson one is something that everybody loves</p>
<p>and all i did was i just sat there and got yelled at</p>
<p>i just took cotton and</p>
<p>stuck it in my ear and just let him yell</p>
<p>and he was absolutely hilarious</p>
<p>but as far as</p>
<p>why the show</p>
<p>stopped and all that i mean i&rsquo;m as much in the dark</p>
<p>as you got i do know that he was</p>
<p>going out and trying to do his shows</p>
<p>and everybody was you know he couldn&rsquo;t get a word out</p>
<p>rick james bitch yeah you know</p>
<p>right what that&rsquo;s my</p>
<p>couch motherfucker</p>
<p>yeah all of that shit right so</p>
<p>you know i have no idea</p>
<p>but what i think is cool</p>
<p>about it is that you just have two killer fucking</p>
<p>seasons you know airtight to get back to that</p>
<p>expression rather than</p>
<p>you know there&rsquo;s certain shows</p>
<p>that they probably</p>
<p>should have quit five</p>
<p>seasons in and they just kept making them</p>
<p>i think if you gave dave a</p>
<p>ton of weed</p>
<p>and let him do whatever the fuck he wanted to do he</p>
<p>would keep cranking them out</p>
<p>i think oh yeah he&rsquo;s perfect for that shit</p>
<p>that blind racist</p>
<p>that was accidentally</p>
<p>blind ku klux klan</p>
<p>guy that was accidentally</p>
<p>black that was</p>
<p>that was at</p>
<p>first what was it</p>
<p>which one was that called what was</p>
<p>the name of this</p>
<p>catch clayton</p>
<p>bigsby yeah god</p>
<p>damn that was brilliant</p>
<p>yeah fucking</p>
<p>brilliant yeah they just need to</p>
<p>leave that guy alone</p>
<p>when i did the fear factor</p>
<p>sketch with him</p>
<p>he was telling me that they were</p>
<p>they were trying to tell him like how many times he</p>
<p>could say nigger and he couldn&rsquo;t say nigger and yeah</p>
<p>you got to stop saying this stop saying that and you</p>
<p>well what happens is i</p>
<p>think when something becomes a</p>
<p>success then everybody wants to try to get their</p>
<p>stink on it so they can be like i was the guy who said</p>
<p>to put the desk over there and but rather than just</p>
<p>going like hey</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re killing</p>
<p>it just keep whatever the fuck you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>because i know like they thought that</p>
<p>somebody on</p>
<p>the show read me that the industry notes for that</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m rick james</p>
<p>bitch sketch and they</p>
<p>the overall</p>
<p>thing was basically this is just a</p>
<p>series of things</p>
<p>that aren&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>funny like they didn&rsquo;t get what was</p>
<p>going on like i remember when they were doing that neil</p>
<p>i lived like</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know like i</p>
<p>could walk up to where they</p>
<p>were editing the thing</p>
<p>and when they did the rick</p>
<p>james thing like neil called me up he&rsquo;s like dude you</p>
<p>gotta come up here and</p>
<p>check this thing out i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think we can top this shit i remember</p>
<p>walking in there</p>
<p>dying laughing for like the</p>
<p>first four minutes and i was just in awe</p>
<p>i was like dude this is the</p>
<p>greatest that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>greatest fucking</p>
<p>sketch of all</p>
<p>time ever ever</p>
<p>ever that show&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>greatest sketch show of all time</p>
<p>nothing even comes close</p>
<p>nothing comes close</p>
<p>i center on</p>
<p>live can&rsquo;t fuck with that</p>
<p>none of those shows can fuck with that yeah they</p>
<p>never had that</p>
<p>laugh for a</p>
<p>second quality as</p>
<p>far as like social commentary</p>
<p>and then just like</p>
<p>ridiculous like</p>
<p>silliness of</p>
<p>the show it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna make me</p>
<p>depressed because it kills me that the fucking</p>
<p>thing what kills me too is that he&rsquo;s like he&rsquo;s doing</p>
<p>stand up and he like you know he&rsquo;ll like announce on</p>
<p>thursday he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna show it cobs on friday</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;ll do two shows and play bongos for five hours</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like i wish the guy was likes putting out specials</p>
<p>you know i wish he was putting out dvds and shit</p>
<p>you know i mean</p>
<p>him twice in the last month</p>
<p>yeah what did you</p>
<p>think he&rsquo;s been out and on the comedy story</p>
<p>well i saw him at the parlor</p>
<p>and i saw him at the comedy</p>
<p>store what&rsquo;d you think</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s interesting</p>
<p>the direction he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going is kind of</p>
<p>going into more of a</p>
<p>where it seems really organic</p>
<p>talking to the audience and</p>
<p>stuff like that but with bits kind of mixed in</p>
<p>so you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>even realize you&rsquo;re getting doing like he&rsquo;s doing</p>
<p>stand up on you</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s weird it&rsquo;s really weird</p>
<p>and then he had like some guys come up and play</p>
<p>music and he was like</p>
<p>like kind of doing like singing and rapping at</p>
<p>points and stuff like that</p>
<p>but again it felt like it wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>planned it felt like</p>
<p>you were getting a show that no one else got to see</p>
<p>but then i talked to a couple of the</p>
<p>other mike comics</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re like oh no no this is</p>
<p>if you see a couple of</p>
<p>these you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>see that this is exactly what his act is now wow</p>
<p>and it was kind of interesting</p>
<p>i liked it i thought it was cool i tell you i was</p>
<p>entertained he pissed off a lot of people at cobbs</p>
<p>cause he was doing like</p>
<p>these five hour sets and</p>
<p>the wait staffs</p>
<p>going fucking nuts</p>
<p>would you do sets or like</p>
<p>do two shows do like</p>
<p>three hours at a</p>
<p>stage what are you</p>
<p>three and a half</p>
<p>hours in what&rsquo;s up</p>
<p>with lamps i mean</p>
<p>how many fucking i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s him and remember when dane cook</p>
<p>tried to top that and</p>
<p>he fucking stayed on</p>
<p>stage for like eight</p>
<p>hours or something</p>
<p>crazy was it seven</p>
<p>is that what it is</p>
<p>by the way the</p>
<p>guinness book of</p>
<p>world records is</p>
<p>ridiculous because there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>always some retard out there with nothing to lose</p>
<p>especially when it comes to</p>
<p>stand up comedy</p>
<p>who the fuck can</p>
<p>define what</p>
<p>stand up comedy</p>
<p>you can get some</p>
<p>complete sociopath to</p>
<p>stand on stage for</p>
<p>three days in</p>
<p>a row and just shit himself and piss all over the</p>
<p>fucking stage</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s like and</p>
<p>then he wins</p>
<p>flag pulls yeah that&rsquo;s bullshit</p>
<p>you just gotta stay up there</p>
<p>you know what this</p>
<p>should be there</p>
<p>should be some like</p>
<p>laugh meter</p>
<p>and once you just start</p>
<p>running out of jokes and just the</p>
<p>lights come</p>
<p>out yeah the</p>
<p>lights come out you have a</p>
<p>certain amount of minutes</p>
<p>where you can play with the</p>
<p>crowd certain</p>
<p>amount of times you can say so what else is</p>
<p>going on before</p>
<p>you just get</p>
<p>like a red flag and it&rsquo;s just like dude this isn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>stand up zero airplanes are sitting up</p>
<p>there yeah it&rsquo;s like it would be</p>
<p>funny if the less you laughed</p>
<p>the less the audience</p>
<p>laughed the brighter the</p>
<p>lights in the room got</p>
<p>you know and to let you know when all the</p>
<p>lights are on the show&rsquo;s not dark anymore</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s like a</p>
<p>video game yeah yeah yeah it&rsquo;s like that guitar hero it</p>
<p>starts going</p>
<p>your spotlight dims</p>
<p>your spotlight dims and the audience gets brighter</p>
<p>so if people want to listen to bill bill also has a</p>
<p>great podcast called the</p>
<p>monday morning</p>
<p>podcast that&rsquo;s available on itunes and it&rsquo;s not on</p>
<p>stitcher anymore</p>
<p>right you pull it off</p>
<p>stitcher yeah i took it off yeah</p>
<p>so it&rsquo;s not a lot of controversy</p>
<p>with this stitcher app</p>
<p>yeah they just saw that</p>
<p>apparently people are getting i love</p>
<p>stitcher and i back it up 100</p>
<p>i think it&rsquo;s fucking awesome</p>
<p>being able to go in your car and just</p>
<p>have be able to choose</p>
<p>podcasts and listen to them automatically you know</p>
<p>streaming kind of what was</p>
<p>the problem i had they just took mine</p>
<p>never told me</p>
<p>and then we&rsquo;re selling</p>
<p>advertising and they will making fucking money whoa</p>
<p>which is yeah that&rsquo;s not fucking cool so that&rsquo;s illegal</p>
<p>yeah we told</p>
<p>them to stop</p>
<p>then they they sent me an offer</p>
<p>which is hilarious it&rsquo;s like someone</p>
<p>stole your your fucking car</p>
<p>and then you show up</p>
<p>gonna give my car back like hey</p>
<p>look i put some rims on it you know you want a</p>
<p>piece of that</p>
<p>yeah well apparently there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a big move to get off of it marin was talking to me</p>
<p>about it yesterday and greg fitzsimmons called me</p>
<p>about it and greg</p>
<p>fitzsimmons had the same situation that you had when</p>
<p>they just put</p>
<p>his shit on</p>
<p>yeah so he said there was a lot of people that</p>
<p>are you gonna</p>
<p>cut me in on the average what</p>
<p>about all you</p>
<p>money you&rsquo;ve already made off of the fucking</p>
<p>thing you didn&rsquo;t get you</p>
<p>yeah exactly it&rsquo;s like that internet</p>
<p>thing we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>just like hey you know everybody can take everybody&rsquo;s</p>
<p>shit i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think there&rsquo;s a problem with that</p>
<p>brian do you not</p>
<p>have any free content and they&rsquo;re selling advertisement</p>
<p>on it no i have no problem with it how come</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re offering</p>
<p>the service</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re offering</p>
<p>if my listeners want to</p>
<p>drive around and be able to</p>
<p>stream my show</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not offering that on my website</p>
<p>so let them do it and</p>
<p>i offer it on my website how do you</p>
<p>drive around so you have to</p>
<p>stream it through it online</p>
<p>you can stream</p>
<p>it you can stream it off of your mobile</p>
<p>phone no you go to</p>
<p>itunes and look it</p>
<p>this is the</p>
<p>thing that&rsquo;s what i&rsquo;m saying though you can&rsquo;t do that</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re driving in your car</p>
<p>right now and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>like i want to listen to joe rogan&rsquo;s podcast from four</p>
<p>weeks ago you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>streaming something that i created you</p>

<p>money for that you</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t just take joe</p>
<p>rogan they&rsquo;re not just</p>
<p>streaming that&rsquo;d be like if i</p>
<p>started a radio station</p>
<p>and i started playing</p>
<p>the music and</p>
<p>let me finish and i didn&rsquo;t pay anybody</p>
<p>i didn&rsquo;t play any of the musicians</p>

<p>they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>putting advertising in the show they&rsquo;re not adding no</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not adding ads in the</p>
<p>show why are guys saying that they are</p>
<p>because i think on</p>
<p>stitcher&rsquo;s website</p>
<p>where like on the apps they have advertisements</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re getting all</p>
<p>these hints who</p>
<p>cares about that because they&rsquo;re making</p>
<p>money off of our stuff dude</p>
<p>people aren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>going to the website to just</p>
<p>just sit there and listen to to</p>
<p>streaming they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going they&rsquo;re listening to content it&rsquo;s like dude</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like a</p>
<p>fucking network yeah but okay let me finish you have a</p>
<p>production house</p>

<p>all right with</p>
<p>what they&rsquo;re doing but</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t just take it and not pay somebody</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s true yeah</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re gonna make</p>
<p>money off of it you have to kick somebody&rsquo;s</p>

<p>videos all the time</p>
<p>right i&rsquo;m not saying</p>
<p>their business</p>
<p>model is not a bad thing</p>

<p>approached me</p>
<p>first and said listen</p>
<p>we got this great</p>
<p>model it&rsquo;s gonna</p>

<p>a year later</p>
<p>after you made all that money</p>
<p>and then i&rsquo;m like what the</p>
<p>fuck i go to take it off and now that i&rsquo;m taking it off</p>
<p>now you&rsquo;re gonna offer me money</p>
<p>all right yeah that&rsquo;s fucked up</p>
<p>yeah yeah that&rsquo;s not how you do business yeah yeah</p>
<p>you could also</p>
<p>think of it this way though too stream</p>
<p>stitcher has</p>
<p>their own community</p>
<p>stitchers like a facebook or a twitter</p>
<p>and so when you</p>
<p>have a show on there they&rsquo;re also introducing you to</p>
<p>their whole yeah but you got a community</p>
<p>you have to ask yeah i know but what you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>is you&rsquo;re making it seem like</p>
<p>stitcher is this entity</p>
<p>that is amazing that people are just</p>
<p>gonna sit there</p>
<p>and stare at</p>
<p>stitcher well it&rsquo;s they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going there for the content</p>
<p>i know i&rsquo;m not saying that they don&rsquo;t provide a service</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not saying any of that</p>
<p>but for them to take my shit</p>
<p>and just put it up there and make</p>
<p>money off of it i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>not saying that they have to give me 100 of the money</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m saying you just</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t just</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t just take his</p>
<p>stuff and copy it and then</p>
<p>start selling ads on it on your thing</p>
<p>right you can&rsquo;t do that</p>
<p>i agree but you</p>
<p>can sue i know</p>
<p>that i know</p>
<p>i listen they also</p>
<p>as an example</p>
<p>stitcher has now put in all the</p>
<p>brand new fords and also a couple</p>
<p>other car dealer</p>
<p>companies have now</p>
<p>added stitcher as</p>
<p>inside their</p>
<p>cars now why</p>
<p>because now</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re moving away from serious</p>
<p>radio and xm</p>
<p>radio into internet</p>
<p>connected it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>because of the content and the amount of hits</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re getting and that has nothing to do with</p>
<p>stitcher that has to do with</p>
<p>joe rogan&rsquo;s fucking hilarious</p>
<p>greg fitzsimmons fucking hilarious</p>
<p>mark marin is doing</p>
<p>these great parts that&rsquo;s why people are</p>
<p>going there</p>
<p>i guess to me</p>
<p>if i could have my shit fucking in</p>
<p>every single ford car that</p>
<p>people can listen to and it&rsquo;s a part of the car now</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m like you</p>
<p>know what what you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>is you&rsquo;re pitching what people on that side do</p>
<p>which is the pimp game</p>
<p>where they talk</p>
<p>about the exposure</p>
<p>and all this</p>
<p>great exposure and then the only way for us to make</p>
<p>money off the exposure is</p>
<p>people go to your shows</p>
<p>and people buy</p>
<p>your cds yeah</p>
<p>let me finish i</p>
<p>still have to get on a fucking</p>
<p>plane and fly to</p>
<p>kansas city</p>
<p>while those</p>
<p>motherfuckers get to</p>
<p>sleep in their own bed</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t have to leave</p>
<p>you know what i mean no huh</p>
<p>what i&rsquo;m saying is we&rsquo;re both</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re acting like you&rsquo;re acting like you eat</p>
<p>toast no what you&rsquo;re saying is</p>
<p>is your that bullshit where</p>
<p>artists get paid in exposure</p>
<p>is the big pimp game in fucking hollywood you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>right it&rsquo;s this carrot that they have you</p>
<p>changed we&rsquo;re gonna stick you on this</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not gonna give you any fucking money</p>
<p>but everybody&rsquo;s gonna hear this and then you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna go to kansas city and</p>
<p>jesus christ the whole you&rsquo;re gonna play with a fucking</p>
<p>royals play</p>
<p>and meanwhile</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re making all this fucking money</p>
<p>well that&rsquo;s the kind and</p>
<p>you gotta be like fucking uh</p>
<p>what it would</p>
<p>you gotta fucking pack up and go fly out to go get your</p>
<p>money this sitting at home</p>
<p>raking and all this shit and this is the thing</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re providing the fucking content</p>
<p>all right they&rsquo;re providing the service so they</p>
<p>should get paid for the service you</p>
<p>should get paid for your content that&rsquo;s all i&rsquo;m saying</p>
<p>this should be a business</p>
<p>marriage if you just don&rsquo;t take the fucking content</p>
<p>if your content was</p>
<p>free already though</p>
<p>your contents free on itunes yeah but you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>put it on your own application that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>not which is my</p>
<p>choice you put it on itunes</p>
<p>yeah and i have and i have the choice i have the choice</p>
<p>to decide my podcast</p>
<p>is fucking free</p>
<p>i could sit there and i</p>
<p>could decide</p>
<p>if if i want to charge</p>
<p>money for but dude it&rsquo;s mine</p>
<p>right it&rsquo;s mine and it&rsquo;s my decision</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not yours to just fucking take</p>
<p>and then because</p>
<p>you know i&rsquo;ve been busting my ass and working on this</p>
<p>thing for fucking</p>
<p>three years</p>
<p>and everybody wants to go see it and now</p>
<p>you just take it make a</p>
<p>ton of fucking</p>
<p>money off of me you don&rsquo;t even tell me you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t call me</p>
<p>up i don&rsquo;t think that they&rsquo;re making a shitload of</p>
<p>money at all i don&rsquo;t the stitches</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not really making a shitload of</p>
<p>money doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>matter if they&rsquo;re making two dollars you have to</p>
<p>give me one</p>
<p>but you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>just make money off people&rsquo;s stuff</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re pretending</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re not selling content they have a</p>
<p>device i listen to my</p>
<p>shit on stitcher</p>
<p>every day i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>never heard an ad once</p>
<p>okay so it&rsquo;s not seeing the ads is the ads</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no ads</p>
<p>playing during my podcast there&rsquo;s no ads before or</p>
<p>after my podcast</p>
<p>so to me i have</p>
<p>no problem with</p>
<p>stitcher and</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not making any</p>
<p>money off me directly</p>
<p>okay that&rsquo;s you but</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>how you&rsquo;re saying they&rsquo;re making</p>
<p>money or anything i open</p>
<p>stitch up right now</p>
<p>i open up stitch</p>
<p>right now i find my</p>
<p>podcast you</p>
<p>think that they do</p>
<p>those those</p>
<p>apple ads for</p>
<p>free you&rsquo;re confused like</p>
<p>you listen to a radio</p>
<p>station for brian</p>
<p>they have abs</p>
<p>right you listen to a</p>
<p>radio station i don&rsquo;t remember</p>
<p>every hearing or</p>
<p>listen to me listen to me</p>
<p>all right okay when you listen to a</p>
<p>radio station they don&rsquo;t play an ad during a song</p>
<p>but you listen to the</p>
<p>radio station because they&rsquo;re playing the kind of</p>
<p>music you wanna listen to</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why are you listening to doody</p>
<p>yeah i&rsquo;m listening</p>
<p>so that&rsquo;s why</p>
<p>if you play a band&rsquo;s song on the fucking radio</p>
<p>the band gets paid</p>
<p>okay you get paid</p>
<p>okay do you</p>
<p>understand that</p>
<p>but i&rsquo;m not saying that there&rsquo;s no ads on this</p>
<p>so i&rsquo;m going to comedy right now i&rsquo;m typing in comedy</p>
<p>now i&rsquo;m going to comedians</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s comedians right up here now there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>little banner that pops up at the very bottom</p>
<p>but i have a little</p>
<p>banner that banner makes money</p>
<p>deathsquatum at the very top little banner</p>
<p>makes money i know but facebook makes</p>
<p>money off you but you&rsquo;re on facebook are you</p>
<p>gonna sue facebook and pull off your stuff on facebook</p>
<p>makes shit look</p>
<p>wait a minute</p>
<p>he had a blog</p>
<p>and they copied his blog entries and put it on facebook</p>
<p>and then started selling advertising yeah i chose</p>
<p>well you chose to be on stitcher right no i didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>yeah they asked you no they didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the whole point of what he&rsquo;s saying brian is</p>
<p>that i chose to be on facebook and i choose what i put</p>
<p>to go to put up i did not choose to be on stitcher</p>
<p>stitcher took my shit and put</p>
<p>see no advertising before it this is me talking</p>
<p>okay brian he&rsquo;s talking yeah dude</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m trying to make i&rsquo;m trying to explain it we had it</p>
<p>right there and you&rsquo;re so convinced of your argument</p>
<p>i mean if you&rsquo;re totally convinced</p>
<p>of argument i&rsquo;ll just stop right</p>
<p>now no no but i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think you understand a lot of like the internet like i</p>
<p>understand that you don&rsquo;t want your mp3</p>
<p>on here so you</p>
<p>can tell them yes i don&rsquo;t want you on here</p>
<p>that stitcher</p>
<p>is not like selling advertisements during your show</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re pretty much</p>
<p>doing what it&rsquo;s available you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>giving it free</p>
<p>i already answered</p>
<p>i answered this like</p>
<p>three minutes ago you&rsquo;re just not listening to me</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not listening to me i realize</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not playing it during it i said when you listen to a</p>
<p>radio station</p>
<p>right they play ac dc back in black</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t play a woo</p>
<p>like commercial in the middle of it</p>
<p>but in between the songs they advertise</p>
<p>and the amount</p>
<p>of listeners that a</p>
<p>radio station gets</p>
<p>is not because of the commercials</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s because of the music</p>
<p>that is there</p>
<p>the artists that put that out there that&rsquo;s why</p>
<p>that the bands get played</p>
<p>they get a portion</p>
<p>of the advertising that&rsquo;s how business is done</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t have a problem with that</p>
<p>i would love to be on</p>
<p>stitcher if they did it the</p>
<p>right way if they approached me and said listen</p>
<p>this is what we&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna sell advertising</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re making this amount of</p>
<p>money we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna kick you that i</p>
<p>would have done it in a</p>
<p>second but the</p>
<p>thing is they just took my podcast</p>
<p>and all my listeners</p>
<p>who go on there</p>
<p>cause they like what i do</p>
<p>and then they made</p>
<p>money off of that because in between</p>
<p>on the side of</p>
<p>their website</p>
<p>and that shit that you saw at the bottom</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re making</p>
<p>money off of that</p>
<p>and they didn&rsquo;t kick me any</p>
<p>money until</p>
<p>you got caught</p>
<p>and it does keep people from getting it off itunes</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the only negative</p>
<p>part about it</p>
<p>in my opinion</p>
<p>is it takes it hurts your itunes numbers</p>
<p>but like as any single website that you used</p>
<p>people if you</p>
<p>give something out for free on the internet</p>
<p>you can consider</p>
<p>stitcher to be just</p>
<p>an mp3 player right</p>
<p>and any application on here</p>
<p>and what they have</p>
<p>is they&rsquo;re making</p>
<p>money off of it look i put it</p>
<p>out there and everybody downloads it and it&rsquo;s for free</p>
<p>right but the</p>
<p>second you take it</p>
<p>and you start making</p>
<p>money off of it</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the same way like if</p>
<p>you you i i see</p>
<p>both of your</p>
<p>points i see both your</p>
<p>points i do see</p>
<p>brian&rsquo;s point</p>
<p>that he did pull</p>
<p>up the application and the only</p>
<p>will add was his little tiny ass banner that no one</p>
<p>really make it</p>
<p>money off that yeah you</p>
<p>could say that that</p>
<p>might be just enough to keep your site</p>
<p>going i mean</p>
<p>how much money</p>
<p>you think that little banner</p>
<p>how much is the app let</p>
<p>me ask you this dude</p>
<p>how do you how do</p>
<p>you run a business</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s a free app free</p>
<p>app how do you run a business</p>
<p>that makes no money</p>
<p>because they are selling</p>
<p>their programs to</p>
<p>companies like ford</p>
<p>so now you buy a ford</p>
<p>and they have a</p>
<p>stitcher app</p>
<p>in there so it&rsquo;s like a serious</p>
<p>rate no and why</p>
<p>is ford getting</p>
<p>in business with them because the the future of</p>
<p>radio is podcasting it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>satellite radio</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not but the</p>
<p>thing is the</p>
<p>thing yeah but i&rsquo;m doing a podcast how come ford</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t come to me</p>
<p>he came to these guys because they</p>
<p>stuck them all together</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s because of all the hits that</p>
<p>joe gets all the fans that i have all the fans that all</p>
<p>these people have these guys</p>
<p>stuck it all into one but they</p>
<p>should have come to us and said this is what we</p>
<p>wanna do and get in</p>
<p>business with us you just don&rsquo;t hijack everybody shit</p>
<p>and then stick it on there</p>
<p>start selling advertising</p>
<p>banners on the</p>
<p>bottom and then getting contracts with ford because</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re looking at</p>
<p>their website they&rsquo;re seeing all the hits that</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re getting</p>
<p>rss feed what</p>
<p>you have when you have a podcast you have an rss feed</p>
<p>what that rss feed means is that</p>
<p>every single that you&rsquo;re letting</p>
<p>everyone you want to play your</p>
<p>mp3 players</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s websites that will grab your rss feed</p>
<p>and just and put it on</p>
<p>their website</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what rss</p>
<p>feed needs you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>sharing it you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>giving after i forget</p>
<p>for free right</p>
<p>right but this is the download</p>
<p>still count but</p>
<p>once download from an rss feed</p>
<p>counts the big argument is that twitter</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t turn around and then take the free</p>
<p>thing and then</p>
<p>start making</p>
<p>money off it</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s common it&rsquo;s business</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s business 101</p>
<p>you have to pay the person</p>
<p>if i&rsquo;m giving away for free</p>
<p>you can just take it you</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t just go out</p>
<p>well maybe they</p>
<p>tried to do it this way and</p>
<p>stitcher also</p>
<p>has a way to pay</p>
<p>their artists now they have the pay</p>
<p>thing now they&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>started a couple of</p>
<p>months ago but bill was</p>
<p>right when i was saying</p>
<p>they should</p>
<p>come to me and</p>
<p>say listen we like</p>
<p>your podcast we&rsquo;ve seen you getting this amount of hits</p>
<p>we want to put it on here we have some advertising</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll kick you some of it dude i</p>
<p>would be on</p>
<p>stitch you haven&rsquo;t done that to you</p>
<p>never you sure</p>
<p>oh yeah he&rsquo;s positive bro</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve come to me to do it he</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve come to me to do it two</p>
<p>months ago they came to me too i allowed them to</p>
<p>put my stuff on they</p>
<p>never came to me but they</p>
<p>never came to him they never came</p>
<p>to me they just took my shit see that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>thing if they came to me</p>
<p>i wouldn&rsquo;t i</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t have had a problem</p>
<p>our podcast is sponsored they came</p>
<p>to me when my lawyers</p>
<p>sent him a cease and desist and then they go oh you</p>
<p>want what if we gave you a percentage of this</p>
<p>money that we&rsquo;ve been making</p>
<p>mmm now if it had nothing to do with my podcast they</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t have offered me that</p>
<p>i think a precedent</p>
<p>has to be established once and it becomes really</p>
<p>profitable and</p>
<p>right now it&rsquo;s not and i totally</p>
<p>agree with you that you can&rsquo;t take your</p>
<p>stuff and just</p>
<p>put it up there</p>
<p>without asking and then put advertisement</p>
<p>on the application</p>
<p>even if it&rsquo;s indirectly</p>
<p>know if there&rsquo;s a certain amount of ads</p>
<p>that you know</p>
<p>you just get</p>
<p>every time you go to</p>
<p>stitcher but one podcast gets</p>
<p>a you know a really high number of downloads like your</p>
<p>monday morning podcast does</p>
<p>well that&rsquo;s your you&rsquo;re selling that you&rsquo;re selling the</p>
<p>monday morning podcast</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re selling when you&rsquo;re advertising</p>
<p>you know i totally get that but</p>
<p>the way i look at podcasting in the</p>
<p>first place is</p>
<p>i want i agree that it&rsquo;s good to have you know</p>
<p>sponsors that pay for</p>
<p>things and you can</p>
<p>you know you could</p>
<p>you know make</p>
<p>money off the show and it&rsquo;s good it&rsquo;s good to</p>
<p>get paid for</p>
<p>someone downloading it and listening to it but</p>
<p>for me what&rsquo;s important is that people get it</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s important for me it&rsquo;s important that</p>
<p>the reason why it&rsquo;s free</p>
<p>on my website as well as free on</p>
<p>ustream as well as free on itunes as well as on</p>
<p>stitchers i just</p>
<p>want yeah ustream&rsquo;s making shit off of you right now</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t have a problem with that</p>
<p>i mean they have to pay for bandwidth</p>
<p>they do u stream</p>
<p>they take care of us and</p>
<p>to be honest</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>i like youtube</p>
<p>you do youtube i</p>
<p>found out that people no you</p>
<p>stream as a video</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re doing this</p>
<p>right now this is oh yeah</p>
<p>no i don&rsquo;t do</p>
<p>video i don&rsquo;t do</p>
<p>video do you have a youtube account</p>
<p>but this thing</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m actually trying</p>
<p>to get advertising</p>
<p>on my website i mean on my podcast</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t have a problem with that but this is like</p>
<p>this is the game of this business</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>the artist does the work</p>
<p>and then the business</p>
<p>guys come in and they give you the fucking heisman</p>
<p>right i mean</p>
<p>i mean it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>right through the</p>
<p>whole business those guys</p>
<p>those guys who made fucking lord of the rings</p>
<p>never got paid</p>
<p>they made six billion dollars they had to sue to get</p>
<p>their fucking money</p>
<p>what do you mean</p>
<p>look it up they got the</p>
<p>whole fucking</p>
<p>thing though</p>
<p>that was a huge</p>
<p>lawsuit is that one of</p>
<p>those things</p>
<p>where they have hollywood type accounting</p>
<p>where they show losses hollywood</p>
<p>yeah we had four billion dollars in</p>
<p>white out in</p>
<p>9 billion in</p>
<p>paper clips so we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>still not in profit</p>
<p>and fucking</p>
<p>you know the director</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t get paid</p>
<p>and yeah it was a huge fucking lawsuit and they just</p>
<p>and then whatever the conglomerate was</p>
<p>they decided that it was</p>
<p>cheaper to just get sued they paid themselves</p>
<p>out then they imploded the</p>
<p>thing just left</p>
<p>and these guys</p>
<p>and it was totally and it&rsquo;s totally fucking legal</p>
<p>wow it&rsquo;s an interesting thing this</p>
<p>whole podcast</p>
<p>thing though isn&rsquo;t it</p>
<p>how you know i mean</p>
<p>basically what we&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>right now is you know they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>at any moment</p>
<p>when we put one of</p>
<p>these things out during the week a</p>
<p>quarter million people download this fucking thing</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s a big number of</p>
<p>human beings that you could just</p>
<p>reach on your own</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t you find that</p>
<p>shows are more packed with</p>
<p>your real fans now than ever before do you find that</p>
<p>i find it&rsquo;s a combination</p>
<p>of doing oprah and anthony</p>
<p>doing morning</p>
<p>radio my specials and my podcast people</p>
<p>definitely listen to the podcast and</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s a great way</p>
<p>to get out and have people</p>
<p>come out to your shows but it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s one of those</p>
<p>things where like</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t do that shit</p>
<p>where i&rsquo;m getting paid in exposure</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re taking all the fucking money</p>
<p>right and then so for the rest of my life in</p>
<p>order for me</p>
<p>to get the fruits from my</p>
<p>labor i gotta go fly to fucking tennessee</p>
<p>right it&rsquo;s like i&rsquo;m i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m doing a i&rsquo;m doing a fucking</p>
<p>radio show here right</p>
<p>radio guys don&rsquo;t go on the fucking road</p>
<p>for some reason it just all goes back to</p>
<p>but then when you do your</p>
<p>monkey dance</p>
<p>you get paid and it&rsquo;s like so no</p>
<p>value is being put on the fact when you go on radio</p>
<p>shows you&rsquo;ll get</p>
<p>money i see</p>
<p>their error in judgment</p>
<p>i see their</p>
<p>error in judgment and i see that what they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing is they take something that&rsquo;s already free</p>
<p>and they make</p>
<p>a device that</p>
<p>allows you to get it to people that</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t ordinarily get it</p>
<p>but it does</p>
<p>when i get to his</p>
<p>point that when i do</p>
<p>radio i&rsquo;m flying</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m in there i fly in there i do</p>
<p>radio and i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>hyping my shows that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>point of it</p>
<p>my podcast is not</p>
<p>hyping my shows</p>
<p>my podcast is my radio show</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s my radio show</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>this is a fucking</p>
<p>radio show dude</p>
<p>right just cause they</p>
<p>call it a podcast</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s my radio show</p>
<p>i can&rsquo;t just hijack the star show</p>
<p>and put it on my site</p>
<p>and just start selling advertising</p>
<p>and then when he tells me to cease and desist</p>
<p>go hey can i let you in on some of this money</p>
<p>and then i go well howard you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>fucking huge man why don&rsquo;t you go fly and stand on a</p>
<p>stage and tell jokes in</p>
<p>kansas city</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll get paid that way</p>
<p>i see what you&rsquo;re saying</p>
<p>yeah i see what you&rsquo;re saying like i</p>
<p>understand like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s it becomes an</p>
<p>issue if it</p>
<p>takes away like</p>
<p>i would love to be in business</p>
<p>those guys with</p>
<p>their exposure but you just have to do it the</p>
<p>right way dude you don&rsquo;t just take it</p>
<p>and make money</p>
<p>and wait till i find out</p>
<p>about it and then offer me a cut i</p>
<p>think when you</p>
<p>when it comes to podcasts and certain</p>
<p>things on the internet</p>
<p>especially when it comes to rss feeds</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>common for the internet like there&rsquo;s companies</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re saying</p>
<p>though is wrong</p>
<p>right because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not rss feeds that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>dealing with you&rsquo;re dealing with someone copying a</p>
<p>thing and then sending it out</p>
<p>through an application</p>
<p>which is completely different as rss feeds</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna get an account of</p>
<p>every download</p>
<p>he has presented the two</p>
<p>classic arguments</p>
<p>that they do when they fuck artists they talk</p>
<p>about exposure</p>
<p>what great exposure this is</p>
<p>and then secondly let me finish and then secondly</p>
<p>he did the whole</p>
<p>this is just the way it&rsquo;s done like you know</p>
<p>when a manager</p>
<p>hands you that contract with this automatically renews</p>
<p>if i get you one</p>
<p>thing at the</p>
<p>chuckle hut</p>
<p>and you say dude this is bullshit</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like no</p>
<p>everything&rsquo;s negotiable you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>right it&rsquo;s negotiable</p>
<p>if you have an rss feed</p>
<p>as an example</p>
<p>if you have something on your</p>
<p>you have something on</p>
<p>most websites wordpress</p>
<p>even rss feed right</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s programs like there&rsquo;s one called flipboard</p>
<p>on the ipad</p>
<p>what it does is it collects</p>
<p>rss feeds and it repackages</p>
<p>it makes your website kind of look like a magazine</p>
<p>that they sell they</p>
<p>kind of mix advertising in there here and there</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s programs that do that</p>
<p>same thing that</p>
<p>stitcher doing</p>
<p>except the only thing that</p>
<p>stitcher&rsquo;s doing is different</p>
<p>is taking it off your server</p>
<p>putting it on</p>
<p>their server</p>
<p>so it doesn&rsquo;t affect your bandwidth but that&rsquo;s a big</p>
<p>issue and it&rsquo;s not affecting the bandwidth</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not confused</p>
<p>with what they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>doing i know</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not confused</p>
<p>with what they&rsquo;re doing you&rsquo;ve explained it like</p>
<p>three times dude i</p>
<p>understand what it is i know but they&rsquo;re not directly</p>
<p>like i&rsquo;m trying to say is they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>like these little</p>
<p>banner advertisements</p>
<p>like that&rsquo;s not making millions of dollars it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t matter but</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s affecting the downloads from itunes</p>
<p>which affect his numbers yeah but you can</p>
<p>get those but</p>
<p>you can get</p>
<p>those numbers</p>
<p>from stitcher</p>
<p>and if you don&rsquo;t want to be on</p>
<p>stitcher you can tell them to take you off a</p>
<p>stitcher yeah but even if you get</p>
<p>those numbers why</p>
<p>and i told them and then</p>
<p>they fucking</p>
<p>obviously this is the</p>
<p>funny thing obviously they&rsquo;re making some</p>
<p>money if they offered me to stay</p>
<p>okay and i also know you can&rsquo;t pay your rent</p>
<p>unless you&rsquo;re making money</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not saying that</p>
<p>those guys are millionaires over there</p>
<p>what i&rsquo;m saying is</p>
<p>that that&rsquo;s not the way you conduct business that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>wrong that&rsquo;s a you can&rsquo;t do that man that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>wrong you can&rsquo;t just take</p>
<p>somebody&rsquo;s creative shit</p>
<p>and just start making</p>
<p>money off of it and not and not paying them</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t understand it</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s that</p>
<p>bizarre internet</p>
<p>thing where people feel</p>
<p>that cause they can they can see it</p>
<p>and they can put it on</p>
<p>their site that they own it and then have the right</p>
<p>to do whatever they want with it and make</p>
<p>money off it and not pay anybody</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not being a dickhead dude</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m really not i&rsquo;m just asking</p>
<p>to go about it</p>
<p>i would love to be on</p>
<p>stitcher in a</p>
<p>functional business</p>
<p>model i don&rsquo;t want to be on it</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s just you just fucking</p>
<p>swipe it and make</p>
<p>money and wait for me to</p>
<p>find out about it</p>
<p>well one thing you</p>
<p>should definitely do is take off your</p>
<p>your podcast off of your rss feed so that that because</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not only a</p>
<p>stitcher doing this</p>
<p>about probably a hundred different companies are</p>
<p>using your rss feed in your</p>
<p>mp3 to make</p>
<p>money right now okay</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s probably a hundred people</p>
<p>daily or hundred</p>
<p>companies that are</p>
<p>using a shit to make</p>
<p>money there&rsquo;s so many</p>
<p>things like</p>
<p>stitcher there&rsquo;s so many websites that will play your</p>
<p>mp i know but that</p>
<p>has nothing to</p>
<p>do what we&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about dude we&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>right and wrong you just</p>
<p>basically said well</p>
<p>you busted this drug dealer there&rsquo;s another</p>
<p>hundred drug dealers out there doing it it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not saying</p>
<p>that there aren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>other people doing it i&rsquo;m saying why i&rsquo;m not on</p>
<p>stitcher anymore</p>
<p>yeah but what i&rsquo;m saying is that that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what the rss means on the internet if you&rsquo;re putting</p>
<p>out an rss feed you&rsquo;re pretty much saying all right</p>
<p>this is an unprotected</p>
<p>work that i am sending out for you guys to have yeah</p>
<p>brian and do</p>
<p>whatever you&rsquo;ve already</p>
<p>addressed no</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not saying</p>
<p>that i&rsquo;m not saying that you can then go make</p>
<p>money off of it i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>saying this is free here you go</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>saying you take off your rss feed off your website no</p>
<p>brian because they&rsquo;re profiting off</p>
<p>the i&rsquo;m not missing</p>
<p>point that&rsquo;s what an rss feed is that mean</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>pretty much it&rsquo;s like an antenna advertising</p>
<p>this is my infantry</p>
<p>you know what you&rsquo;re doing</p>
<p>is you&rsquo;re telling me</p>
<p>what i&rsquo;m thinking what my intent</p>
<p>is no no i&rsquo;m just saying what</p>
<p>an rss feed is</p>
<p>brian we know what an rss</p>
<p>feed is it&rsquo;s just something that</p>
<p>allows people to download something it&rsquo;s an automatic</p>
<p>download you&rsquo;re saying</p>
<p>that because i</p>
<p>that i&rsquo;m saying that</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m on that</p>
<p>yeah but you can&rsquo;t sell advertising</p>
<p>using someone&rsquo;s content and sell</p>
<p>advertising i don&rsquo;t know why that&rsquo;s so hard for you to</p>
<p>understand they&rsquo;re not directly</p>
<p>selling content advertising towards your content</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what i&rsquo;m saying like</p>
<p>that the rss feeds</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s websites that are playing his mp3</p>
<p>right now on</p>
<p>their thing</p>
<p>this is ridiculous</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t even because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like i don&rsquo;t i know exactly</p>
<p>no you don&rsquo;t you&rsquo;re using</p>
<p>shitty logic your</p>
<p>logic sucks</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re selling advertising and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>using other</p>
<p>people when</p>
<p>you listen to a</p>
<p>radio station</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t put on the</p>
<p>radio station</p>
<p>because of the fucking advertising it&rsquo;s the band&rsquo;s</p>
<p>that bring you there like</p>
<p>these guys play the</p>
<p>music i want that&rsquo;s why the bands get played</p>
<p>people are going to</p>
<p>stitch her so</p>
<p>you have a problem with youtube too then do you have</p>
<p>videos on youtube dude this is one of</p>
<p>these guys like this is</p>
<p>one of these guys</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s just like</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t make a</p>
<p>point because he&rsquo;s already rss features</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re already</p>
<p>thinking of his next</p>
<p>point and he just wants to be</p>
<p>right no i&rsquo;m just saying what that&rsquo;s what rss needs</p>
<p>if you don&rsquo;t want your shit</p>
<p>distributed and</p>
<p>made money off it</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have an rss feed on your website rss feed</p>
<p>on your website is for</p>
<p>other websites to grab and use your content for free</p>
<p>no it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>get shit for free</p>
<p>no it&rsquo;s to download shit for free</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s something that</p>
<p>allows you to keep up with people</p>
<p>as they put out podcast you&rsquo;re gonna go</p>
<p>on your ipod</p>
<p>stitch or does</p>
<p>stitch or grab your rss feed and prepackages no it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t sound it</p>
<p>copies your</p>
<p>mp3 you&rsquo;re wrong</p>
<p>and it copies your</p>
<p>mp3 and then sends it out through its own application</p>
<p>and has advertising application you have</p>
<p>100 percent</p>
<p>wrong and there&rsquo;s no way to convince him because he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>totally convinced of his argument yeah</p>
<p>totally convinced of it</p>
<p>brian the point is</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re not saying you&rsquo;re a bad person the point</p>
<p>is you cannot</p>
<p>listen you use the youtube</p>
<p>argument and it&rsquo;s a shitty argument and here&rsquo;s why</p>
<p>if fucking youtube was</p>
<p>stealing bill burr</p>
<p>shit and putting it on youtube and then selling ads</p>
<p>that would work that</p>
<p>would be like hey what the fuck you can&rsquo;t have bill</p>
<p>burr shit on</p>
<p>but youtube is fans</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s some kid in nebraska that</p>
<p>thinks bill</p>
<p>burr is hilarious</p>
<p>and he watches his special in comedy central</p>
<p>and he takes his computer and he edits a 10</p>
<p>minute chunk</p>
<p>and he throws it up on youtube and then i</p>
<p>have no problem</p>
<p>with exactly i have no</p>
<p>problem i don&rsquo;t even have a problem it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>completely different</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s bad enough when i have a dvd coming out the</p>
<p>second somebody sees it then they put it on there but i</p>
<p>understand now it&rsquo;s like okay</p>
<p>the dvd thing</p>
<p>is over now</p>
<p>like i get that</p>
<p>thing but this is</p>
<p>where the problem comes is if you then take my content</p>
<p>okay and then</p>
<p>start advertising off of it</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t fucking pay me that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>thing i understand that my shit&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna end up</p>
<p>on the internet</p>
<p>and people are</p>
<p>gonna get it for free</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s just the way</p>
<p>things are now</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t have a problem with that the big fucking hurdle</p>
<p>is when you take it</p>
<p>and then you</p>
<p>start making</p>
<p>money on application then have ads</p>
<p>yeah you start making</p>
<p>money off your arguments</p>
<p>completely yeah</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a reason why</p>
<p>they came back to me</p>
<p>when i took it down and offered me a cut</p>
<p>yeah and there&rsquo;s a reason why they</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t want me to take it down because i have listeners</p>
<p>who go there</p>
<p>and when they go there they see the ad</p>
<p>and they read it</p>
<p>and in the advertising</p>
<p>world that means</p>
<p>well we get enough guys looking at it they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna fucking buy something</p>
<p>but if they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going there because they like your podcast</p>
<p>or they like my podcast that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why they have to kick you a little bit of</p>
<p>money yeah there&rsquo;s a reason why all</p>
<p>these people</p>
<p>want to say any of that</p>
<p>shit i&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>saying like</p>
<p>their website is fucking awesome</p>
<p>the way they do business is not</p>
<p>and the youtube argument the thing</p>
<p>about youtube that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>crazy is that even though the kids</p>
<p>are putting bill burr&rsquo;s podcast</p>
<p>or bill burr&rsquo;s</p>
<p>stand up mp3s or clips from a</p>
<p>movie that&rsquo;s funny</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re getting sued by all</p>
<p>these people that own that</p>
<p>stuff which i</p>
<p>would and then it gets and i</p>
<p>would hold down that&rsquo;s one of</p>
<p>those things</p>
<p>where if stitcher wasn&rsquo;t making any</p>
<p>money and just want to fucking</p>
<p>throw it out there i</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t give a shit yeah</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the fact that you&rsquo;re making</p>
<p>money off my podcast you</p>
<p>gotta give me some money</p>
<p>those kids who take</p>
<p>my specials</p>
<p>and put them all over</p>
<p>the fucking youtube i love it</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s fucking</p>
<p>great i have no problem with that</p>
<p>if they were somehow figured out a way to make</p>
<p>money you have to fucking pay me</p>
<p>right right</p>
<p>a certain portion</p>
<p>and i respect the fact if you come up with the business</p>
<p>model that makes</p>
<p>because i don&rsquo;t have the business model</p>
<p>but you still</p>
<p>you know the content</p>
<p>is the model</p>
<p>is you start</p>
<p>charging for your podcast</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s that the</p>
<p>model is you</p>
<p>start charging for your podcast</p>
<p>what do you mean</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s pretty much how you have to</p>
<p>if that is or if you</p>
<p>protect your life</p>
<p>and protect your inventory yeah</p>
<p>i want to have</p>
<p>ads that&rsquo;s what i want to have i want to have ads</p>
<p>and i don&rsquo;t want to have somebody</p>
<p>take my podcast and have advertising</p>
<p>around it and that type of shit and make money</p>
<p>not tell me they&rsquo;re taking my podcast</p>
<p>earn money and not give me any of the money</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s all i&rsquo;m saying</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t have any problem</p>
<p>i would love to be in business with</p>
<p>those guys like if they just if they</p>
<p>fucking did it the</p>
<p>right way they didn&rsquo;t so</p>
<p>i just had him take it down i mean it&rsquo;s just normal</p>
<p>business yeah</p>
<p>i mean i think eventually that this look</p>
<p>everybody is</p>
<p>saying that eventually</p>
<p>i won&rsquo;t be back up on</p>
<p>stitcher because they already offered me something</p>
<p>but what i&rsquo;m saying the reason why</p>
<p>i took it down is because what they did was not right</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s just not how you do business</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s stealing i</p>
<p>agree i agree</p>
<p>our situation is totally different i</p>
<p>agreed to be on</p>
<p>stitcher cause my</p>
<p>my way of looking at it</p>
<p>is i just want more people to get the podcast and our</p>
<p>only advertisement that we have is by the</p>
<p>flashlight and</p>
<p>i have no idea</p>
<p>i mean having them on stitch</p>
<p>in my opinion that&rsquo;s good for the</p>
<p>flashlights good for that company</p>
<p>no i met with</p>
<p>some people the</p>
<p>other day who want to read</p>
<p>they want to sell advertising</p>
<p>and on my podcast and they want to do a 50 50</p>
<p>split and i</p>
<p>might do that</p>
<p>sounds cool my feeling is that i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna have i&rsquo;m gonna</p>
<p>bring in my own advertisers you know and i&rsquo;ve got some</p>
<p>other people that i&rsquo;m looking at</p>
<p>as far as advertisers it&rsquo;s got to be something that i</p>
<p>think is valid some</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>gonna have them just advertise</p>
<p>the podcast and you can put it wherever</p>
<p>the fuck you want man put it anywhere i don&rsquo;t care</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s important to me is that it gets out</p>
<p>there which is exactly how</p>
<p>i feel i did</p>
<p>these shows in gotham</p>
<p>in new york this weekend</p>
<p>and i had fucking four hours</p>
<p>sleep in two</p>
<p>days i mean i was exhausted and i had to do two shows</p>
<p>but the fucking</p>
<p>crowds were so good it was so intense man and when i</p>
<p>asked them like how many guys listen to the podcast</p>
<p>it was like fucking 99</p>
<p>it was crazy like</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an audience of podcast fans now</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a totally different audience</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not just</p>
<p>stand up fans or not just fans</p>
<p>of mma ufc fans</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s people that are fucking fans of the podcast</p>
<p>and so to me it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>invaluable and the most important</p>
<p>thing is that</p>
<p>the most people possible can get it for free</p>
<p>but i completely see your argument</p>
<p>and i think you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>absolutely right</p>
<p>to be upset that someone downloaded your</p>
<p>stuff and even if it&rsquo;s just a little pop up banner</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re making</p>
<p>money off that it&rsquo;s the same as the youtube argument</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s the thing</p>
<p>about it was</p>
<p>unless somebody told me</p>
<p>it was on there</p>
<p>i was never</p>
<p>gonna know because</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t come to me right</p>
<p>yeah that&rsquo;s not cool</p>
<p>it would be just as if youtube came and started</p>
<p>downloading your</p>
<p>stuff off tv</p>
<p>and putting it online well hey it was on tv it was free</p>
<p>but no it had ads</p>
<p>on tv and you know now you&rsquo;re just putting in this link</p>
<p>the thing that the big hurdle</p>
<p>is when you</p>
<p>start making</p>
<p>money off of my shit</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the thing</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s like if people see me on tv they download</p>
<p>they put it up there i don&rsquo;t give a fuck if you have</p>
<p>time players makes</p>
<p>money off your</p>
<p>shit windows</p>
<p>media player makes</p>
<p>money off your shit just by playing your</p>
<p>stuff you know</p>
<p>all this crap is just like just</p>
<p>how the internet works and you</p>
<p>keep saying</p>
<p>how the internet</p>

<p>right stop asking me questions i can&rsquo;t</p>

<p>about something</p>
<p>because you</p>
<p>guys don&rsquo;t understand you are</p>
<p>yelling like a little child</p>
<p>you guys are</p>
<p>attacking me</p>
<p>no we just disagree</p>
<p>with you and we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>using logic</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re getting</p>
<p>angry about it</p>
<p>i think the best</p>
<p>example is when</p>
<p>a baseball game</p>
<p>or a football game it&rsquo;s on network tv that&rsquo;s free</p>
<p>plug in a fucking tv</p>
<p>network tvs free</p>
<p>okay right you&rsquo;re not allowed</p>
<p>to record it</p>
<p>and then start selling it</p>
<p>putting it on a player and selling it</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t that they have that</p>
<p>at the end of</p>
<p>every single</p>
<p>even if you include the advertisements you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>allowed to do that you can&rsquo;t just have your own team</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a new format i</p>
<p>mean i can record the</p>
<p>thing and have some friends come over and</p>
<p>watch the fucking</p>
<p>thing that&rsquo;s no big deal</p>
<p>but the second i start</p>
<p>charging people to come through the door</p>
<p>to watch this game and provided</p>
<p>you know all my friends didn&rsquo;t have tvs</p>
<p>then it&rsquo;s yeah then it&rsquo;s like no you&rsquo;re making</p>
<p>money off our show or taking that show</p>
<p>and like playing it at a bar</p>
<p>on a vhs tape and</p>
<p>costing people</p>
<p>and charging and</p>
<p>charging them yeah</p>
<p>you in trouble</p>
<p>i see your point</p>
<p>and i see where</p>
<p>brian&rsquo;s coming from i know what you&rsquo;re trying to say</p>
<p>brian i think you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>just a little emotionally tied up in this argument</p>
<p>and not talk</p>
<p>anymore okay</p>
<p>well i&rsquo;m trying to soothe</p>
<p>things over and not have you be a little</p>
<p>child here i&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>now i&rsquo;m considered a</p>
<p>child i&rsquo;m a considered child now</p>
<p>you guys you guys</p>
<p>i can&rsquo;t talk about it</p>
<p>i can&rsquo;t talk</p>
<p>about it more</p>
<p>like i&rsquo;m talking</p>
<p>my mom about</p>
<p>email right now</p>
<p>no it&rsquo;s not it&rsquo;s like we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>talking to a child</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not being</p>
<p>condescending man like</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re talking to your mom</p>
<p>email you clearly</p>
<p>are being condescending look you</p>
<p>could be mad</p>
<p>the fourth hour will be the best fucking hour</p>
<p>yeah we gotta go</p>
<p>four minutes</p>
<p>until it&rsquo;s gonna</p>
<p>read this bitch</p>
<p>ride this bitch</p>
<p>right into the rocks</p>
<p>i know i didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think i was</p>
<p>gonna problem with rush hour traffic</p>
<p>but we just</p>
<p>started stopping an hour ago</p>
<p>and somewhere</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve been talking</p>
<p>about stitcher</p>
<p>and internet</p>
<p>for this is</p>
<p>gonna be the</p>
<p>usual illusion one and two podcast listen</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all good</p>
<p>folks you know</p>
<p>i see brian&rsquo;s</p>
<p>point i know</p>
<p>brian likes</p>
<p>stitcher and he loves the app</p>
<p>and i see what he&rsquo;s saying</p>
<p>about if you put something out there people are</p>
<p>gonna take it but</p>
<p>i also absolutely see bill&rsquo;s</p>
<p>point you can&rsquo;t just download his</p>
<p>stuff and then use it it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>people who enjoy limewire</p>
<p>why wouldn&rsquo;t you love limewire it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>all free fucking shit exactly but</p>
<p>at the end of the day the service is corrupt</p>
<p>the beautiful</p>
<p>thing about the internet is that you can put</p>
<p>things out there and you can use</p>
<p>this format</p>
<p>to get more people to</p>
<p>watch your shows and get more people</p>
<p>but if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna sell ads i</p>
<p>agree with you</p>
<p>you gotta get paid</p>
<p>i mean it&rsquo;s no different than radio</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s no different than</p>
<p>television it&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>different than any</p>
<p>other service that you&rsquo;re providing that people are</p>
<p>profiting off and that was my</p>
<p>thing as long</p>
<p>as they just came to me and just said listen we want</p>
<p>to put it on here we provide this service we&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>self advertise</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;ll give you a little</p>
<p>piece of it</p>
<p>yes because we know people aren&rsquo;t coming here</p>
<p>to stare at our website</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re actually coming here to listen to your show</p>
<p>that you produce and you create</p>
<p>i agree with</p>
<p>brian&rsquo;s point</p>
<p>as an internet realist i totally</p>
<p>agree with brian&rsquo;s</p>
<p>point that you put something on</p>
<p>an rss feed you&rsquo;re just</p>
<p>allowing people to download it for free</p>
<p>and they can probably</p>
<p>pretty much do whatever the fuck they want with it</p>
<p>but they don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>short of trying to make</p>
<p>money out of it yeah i was</p>
<p>never i was never</p>
<p>no but we got</p>
<p>three minutes</p>
<p>but people sell heroin that</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s legal</p>
<p>three minutes</p>
<p>yeah we heard you bro</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna just have</p>
<p>three minutes of silence and see if you can cry</p>
<p>i know i cry it&rsquo;s just it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s it</p>
<p>never i can&rsquo;t even talk about yeah you can&rsquo;t talk</p>
<p>because we don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>agree with your point of view</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no i&rsquo;m not upset you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>understand my point of view and then every time i try</p>
<p>to explain you said you&rsquo;re repeating your</p>
<p>let me tell your point of view</p>
<p>right now you&rsquo;re saying it&rsquo;s my</p>
<p>fault for putting it out there</p>
<p>i put it out there and i put it on on this the rss feed</p>
<p>and that gives it out to anybody i&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>saying it&rsquo;s your</p>
<p>fault i&rsquo;m saying if you</p>
<p>want to stop it then don&rsquo;t have an rss feed out there</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s for hey if you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>want to get shot in the head don&rsquo;t go out of the house</p>
