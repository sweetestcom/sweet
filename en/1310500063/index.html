    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>The following is a conversation with Stephen Kotkin, a professor of history at Princeton</p>
<p>University and one of the great historians of our time, specializing in Russian and Soviet</p>
<p>history.</p>
<p>He has written many books on Stalin and the Soviet Union, including the first two of a</p>
<p>three volume work on Stalin, and he is currently working on volume three.</p>
<p>You may have noticed that I&rsquo;ve been speaking with not just computer scientists, but physicists,</p>
<p>engineers, historians, neuroscientists, and soon much more.</p>
<p>To me, artificial intelligence is much bigger than deep learning, bigger than computing.</p>
<p>It is our civilization&rsquo;s journey into understanding the human mind and creating echoes of it in</p>
<p>the machine.</p>
<p>To me, that journey must include a deep historical and psychological understanding of power.</p>
<p>Technology puts some of the greatest power in the history of our civilization into the</p>
<p>hands of engineers and computer scientists.</p>
<p>This power must not be abused.</p>
<p>And the best way to understand how such abuse can be avoided is to not be blind to the lessons</p>
<p>of history.</p>
<p>As Stephen Kotkin brilliantly articulates, Stalin was arguably one of the most powerful</p>
<p>humans in history.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve read many books on Joseph Stalin, Vladimir Putin, and the wars of the 20th century.</p>
<p>I hope you understand the value of such knowledge to all of us, especially to engineers and</p>
<p>scientists who built the tools of power in the 21st century.</p>

<p>I recently started doing ads at the end of the introduction, I&rsquo;ll do one or two minutes</p>
<p>after introducing the episode, and never any ads in the middle that can break the flow</p>
<p>of the conversation.</p>
<p>I hope that works for you and doesn&rsquo;t hurt the listening experience.</p>
<p>This show is presented by Cash App, the number one finance app in the App Store.</p>
<p>I personally use Cash App to send money to friends, but you can also use it to buy, sell,</p>
<p>and deposit Bitcoin in just seconds.</p>
<p>Cash App also has an investing feature.</p>
<p>You can buy fractions of a stock, say $1 worth, no matter what the stock price is.</p>
<p>Your services are provided by Cash App Investing, a subsidiary of Square, and member SIPC.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m excited to be working with Cash App to support one of my favorite organizations</p>
<p>called FIRST, best known for their FIRST Robotics and Lego competitions.</p>
<p>They educate and inspire hundreds of thousands of students in over 110 countries and have</p>
<p>a perfect rating on Charity Navigator, which means the donated money is used to maximum</p>
<p>effectiveness.</p>
<p>When you get Cash App from the App Store, Google Play, and use code LexPodcast, you&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>get $10, and Cash App will also donate $10 to FIRST, which again, is an organization</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ve personally seen inspire girls and boys to dream of engineering a better world.</p>
<p>And now, here&rsquo;s my conversation with Stephen Kotkin.</p>
<p>Do all human beings crave power?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Human beings crave security.</p>
<p>They crave love.</p>
<p>They crave adventure.</p>
<p>They crave power, but not equally.</p>
<p>Some human beings nevertheless do crave power.</p>
<p>For sure.</p>
<p>What words is that deeply in the psychology of people?</p>
<p>Is it something you&rsquo;re born with?</p>
<p>Is it something you develop?</p>
<p>Some people crave a position of leadership or of standing out, of being recognized, and</p>
<p>that could be starting out in the school years on the schoolyard.</p>
<p>It could be within their own family, not just in their peer group.</p>
<p>Those kind of people we often see craving leadership positions from a young age often</p>
<p>end up in positions of power.</p>
<p>But they can be varied positions of power.</p>
<p>You can have power in an institution where your power is purposefully limited.</p>
<p>For example, there&rsquo;s a board or a consultative body or a separation of powers.</p>
<p>Not everyone craves power whereby they&rsquo;re the sole power or they&rsquo;re their unconstrained</p>
<p>power.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a little bit less usual.</p>
<p>We may think that everybody does, but not everybody does.</p>
<p>Those people who do crave that kind of power, unconstrained, the ability to decide as much</p>
<p>as life or death of other people, those people are not everyday people.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not the people you encounter in your daily life for the most part.</p>
<p>Those are extraordinary people.</p>
<p>Most of them don&rsquo;t have the opportunity to live that dream.</p>
<p>Very few of them, in fact, end up with the opportunity to live that dream.</p>
<p>So percentage wise, in your sense, if we think of George Washington, for example, would most</p>
<p>people given the choice of absolute power over a country versus maybe the capped power</p>
<p>that the United States presidential role, at least at the founding of the country represented,</p>
<p>what do you think most people would choose?</p>
<p>Well, Washington was in a position to exercise far greater power than he did.</p>
<p>And in fact, he didn&rsquo;t take that option.</p>
<p>He was more interested in seeing institutionalization, of seeing the country develop strong institutions</p>
<p>rather than an individual leader like himself have excess power.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s very important.</p>
<p>So like I said, not everyone craves unconstrained power, even if they&rsquo;re very ambitious.</p>
<p>And of course, Washington was very ambitious.</p>
<p>He was a successful general before he was a president.</p>
<p>So that clearly comes from the influences on your life, where you grow up, how you grow</p>
<p>up, how you raised, what kind of values are imparted to you along the way.</p>
<p>You can understand power as the ability to share, or you can understand or the ability</p>
<p>to advance something for the collective in a collective process, not an individual process.</p>
<p>So power comes in many different varieties.</p>
<p>And ambition doesn&rsquo;t always equate to despotic power.</p>
<p>Right power is something different from ordinary institutional power that we see.</p>
<p>The president of MIT does not have unconstrained power.</p>
<p>The president of MIT rightly must consult with other members of the administration,</p>
<p>with the faculty members, to a certain extent with the student body and certainly with the</p>
<p>trustees of MIT.</p>
<p>Those constraints make the institution strong and enduring and make the decisions better</p>
<p>than they would be if he had unconstrained power.</p>
<p>But you can&rsquo;t say that the president is not ambitious.</p>
<p>Of course, the president is ambitious.</p>
<p>We worry about unconstrained power.</p>
<p>We worry about executive authority that&rsquo;s not limited.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the definition of authoritarianism or tyranny.</p>
<p>Unlimited or barely limited executive authority.</p>
<p>Executive authority is necessary to carry out many functions.</p>
<p>We all understand that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why MIT has an executive, has a president.</p>
<p>But unlimited or largely unconstrained executive power is detrimental to even the person who</p>
<p>exercises that power.</p>
<p>So what do you think?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an interesting notion.</p>
<p>We kind of take it for granted that constraints on executive power is a good thing.</p>
<p>But why is that necessarily true?</p>
<p>So what is it about absolute power that does something bad to the human mind?</p>
<p>So you know, the popular saying of absolute power corrupts absolutely.</p>
<p>Is that the case?</p>
<p>That the power in itself is the thing that corrupts the mind in some kind of way where</p>
<p>it leads to a bad leadership over time?</p>
<p>People make more mistakes when they&rsquo;re not challenged.</p>
<p>When they don&rsquo;t have to explain things and get others to vote and go along with it.</p>
<p>When they can make a decision without anybody being able to block their decision or to have</p>
<p>input necessarily on their decision.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re more prone to mistakes.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re more prone to extremism.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a temptation there.</p>
<p>For example, we have separation of powers in the United States.</p>
<p>The Congress, right, has authority that the president doesn&rsquo;t have.</p>
<p>As for example, in budgeting, the so called power of the purse.</p>
<p>This can be very frustrating.</p>
<p>People want to see things happen and they complain that there&rsquo;s a do nothing Congress</p>
<p>or that the situation is stalemated.</p>
<p>But actually that&rsquo;s potentially a good thing.</p>
<p>In fact, that&rsquo;s how our system was designed.</p>
<p>Our system was designed to prevent things happening in government.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s frustration with that, but ultimately that&rsquo;s the strength of the institutions we</p>
<p>have.</p>
<p>And so when you see unconstrained executive authority, there can be a lot of dynamism.</p>
<p>A lot of things can get done quickly.</p>
<p>But those things can be like, for example, what happened in China under Mao or what happened</p>
<p>in the Soviet Union under Stalin or what happened in Haiti under Papa Doc and then Baby Doc</p>
<p>or fill in the blank, right?</p>
<p>What happens sometimes in corporations where a corporate leader is not constrained by the</p>
<p>shareholders, by the board or by anything.</p>
<p>And they can seem to be a genius for a while, but eventually it catches up to them.</p>
<p>And so the idea of constraints on executive power is absolutely fundamental to the American</p>
<p>system, American way of thinking.</p>
<p>And not only America, obviously large other parts of the world that have a similar system,</p>
<p>not an identical system, but a similar system of checks and balances on executive power.</p>
<p>And so the case that I study, the only checks and balances on executive power are circumstantial.</p>
<p>So for example, distances in the country, it&rsquo;s hard to do something over 5,000 miles</p>
<p>or the amount of time in a day, it&rsquo;s hard for a leader to get to every single thing</p>
<p>the leader wants to get to because there are only 24 hours in a day.</p>
<p>Those are circumstantial constraints on executive power.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not institutional constraints on executive power.</p>
<p>One of the constraints on executive power that United States has versus Russia, maybe</p>
<p>something you&rsquo;ve implied and actually spoke directly to is there&rsquo;s something in the Russian</p>
<p>people and the Soviet people that are attracted to authoritarian power, psychologically speaking,</p>
<p>or at least the kind of leaders that sought authoritarian power throughout its history.</p>
<p>And that desire for that kind of human is a lack of a constraint.</p>
<p>In America, it seems as people, we desire somebody not like Stalin, somebody more like</p>
<p>George Washington.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s another constraint, the belief of the people, what they admire in a leader,</p>
<p>what they seek in a leader.</p>
<p>So maybe you can speak to, well, first of all, can you speak briefly to that psychology</p>
<p>of, is there a difference between the Russian people and the American people in terms of</p>
<p>just what we find attractive in a leader?</p>
<p>Not as great a difference as it might seem.</p>
<p>There are unfortunately many Americans who would be happy with an authoritarian leader</p>
<p>in the country.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s by no means a majority.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not even a plurality, but nonetheless, it&rsquo;s a real sentiment in the population.</p>
<p>Sometimes because they feel frustrated because things are not getting done.</p>
<p>Sometimes because they&rsquo;re against something that&rsquo;s happening in the political realm and</p>
<p>they feel it has to be corrected and corrected quickly.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a kind of impulse.</p>
<p>People can regret the impulse later on, that the impulse is motivated by reaction to their</p>
<p>environment.</p>
<p>In the Russian case, we have also people who crave, sometimes known as a strong hand, an</p>
<p>iron hand, an authoritarian leader, because they want things to be done and be done more</p>
<p>quickly that align with their desires.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m not sure it&rsquo;s a majority in the country today.</p>
<p>Certainly in Stalin&rsquo;s time, this was a widespread sentiment and people had few alternatives</p>
<p>that they understood or could appeal to.</p>
<p>Nowadays in the globalized world, the citizens of Russia can see how other systems have constraints</p>
<p>on executive power and the life isn&rsquo;t so bad there.</p>
<p>In fact, the life might even be better.</p>
<p>So the impatience, the impulsive quality, the frustration does sometimes in people reinforce</p>
<p>their craving for the unconstrained executive to quote, get things done or shake things</p>
<p>up.</p>
<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>But in the Russian case, I&rsquo;m not sure it&rsquo;s cultural today.</p>
<p>I think it might be more having to do with the failures, the functional failures of the</p>
<p>kind of political system that they tried to institute after the Soviet collapse.</p>
<p>And so it may be frustration with the version of constraints on executive power they got</p>
<p>and how it didn&rsquo;t work the way it was imagined, which has led to a sense in which nonconstrained</p>
<p>executive power could fix things.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m not sure that that&rsquo;s a majority sentiment in the Russian case, although it&rsquo;s hard to</p>
<p>measure because under authoritarian regimes, a public opinion is shaped by the environment</p>
<p>in which people live, which is very constrained in terms of public opinion.</p>
<p>But on that point, why at least from a distance does there seem to nevertheless be support</p>
<p>for the current Russian president Vladimir Putin?</p>
<p>Is that have to do with the fact that measuring, getting good metrics and statistics on support</p>
<p>is difficult in authoritarian governments, or is there still something appealing to that</p>
<p>kind of power to the people?</p>
<p>I think we have to give credit to President Putin for understanding the psychology of</p>
<p>the Russians to whom he appeals.</p>
<p>Many of them were the losers in the transition from communism.</p>
<p>They were the ones whose pensions were destroyed by inflation or whose salaries didn&rsquo;t go up</p>
<p>or whose regions were abandoned.</p>
<p>They were not the winners for the most part, and so I think there&rsquo;s an understanding on</p>
<p>his part of their psychology.</p>
<p>Putin has grown in the position.</p>
<p>He was not a public politician when he first started out.</p>
<p>He was quite poor in public settings.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t have the kind of political instincts that he has now.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t have the appeal to traditional values and the Orthodox Church and some of the other</p>
<p>dimensions of his rule today.</p>
<p>So yes, we have to give some credit to Putin himself for this in addition to the frustrations</p>
<p>and the mass of the people.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s think about it this way in addition, without taking away the fact that he&rsquo;s become</p>
<p>a better retail politician over time and that sentiment has shifted because of the disappointments</p>
<p>with the transition with the population.</p>
<p>When I ask my kids, am I a good dad?</p>
<p>My kids don&rsquo;t have any other dad to measure me against.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m the only dad they know, and I&rsquo;m the only dad they can choose or not choose.</p>
<p>If they don&rsquo;t choose me, they still get me as dad, right?</p>
<p>So with Putin today, he&rsquo;s the only dad that the Russian people have.</p>
<p>Now, if my kids were introduced to alternative fathers, they might be better than me.</p>
<p>They might be more loving, more giving, funnier, richer, whatever it might be.</p>
<p>They might be more appealing.</p>
<p>There are some blood ties there for sure that I have with my kids, but they would at least</p>
<p>be able to choose alternatives and then I would have to win their favor in that constellation</p>
<p>of alternatives.</p>
<p>If President Putin were up against real alternatives, if the population had real choice and that</p>
<p>choice could express itself and have resources and have media and everything else the way</p>
<p>he does, maybe he would be very popular and maybe his popularity would not be as great</p>
<p>as it currently is.</p>
<p>So the absence of alternatives is another factor that reinforces his authority and his</p>
<p>popularity.</p>
<p>Having said that, there are many authoritarian leaders who deny any alternatives to the</p>
<p>population and are not very popular.</p>
<p>So denial of alternatives doesn&rsquo;t guarantee you the popularity.</p>
<p>You still have to figure out the mass psychology and be able to appeal to it.</p>
<p>So in the Russian case, the winners from the transition live primarily in the big cities</p>
<p>and are self employed or entrepreneurial.</p>
<p>Even if they&rsquo;re not self employed, they&rsquo;re able to change careers.</p>
<p>They have tremendous skills and talent and education and knowledge as well as these entrepreneurial</p>
<p>or dynamic personalities.</p>
<p>Putin also appealed to them.</p>
<p>He did that with Medvedev and it was a very clever ruse.</p>
<p>He himself appealed to the losers from the transition, the small towns, the rural, the</p>
<p>people who were not well off and he had them for the most part.</p>
<p>Not all.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t want to generalize to say that he had every one of them because those people</p>
<p>have views of their own, sometimes in contradiction with the president of Russia.</p>
<p>And then he appealed to the opposite people, the successful urban base through the so called</p>
<p>reformer Medvedev, the new generation, the technically literate prime minister who for</p>
<p>a time was president.</p>
<p>And so that worked very successfully for Putin.</p>
<p>He was able to bridge a big divide in the society and gain a greater mass support than</p>
<p>he would otherwise have had by himself.</p>
<p>That ruse only worked through the time that Medvedev was temporarily president for a few</p>
<p>years because of the Constitution, Putin couldn&rsquo;t do three consecutive terms and stepped aside</p>
<p>in what they call castling in chess.</p>
<p>When this was over, Putin had difficulty with his popularity.</p>
<p>There were mass protests in the urban areas, precisely that group of the population that</p>
<p>he had been able to win in part because of the Medvedev castling and now had had their</p>
<p>delusions exposed and were disillusioned, and there were these mass protests in the</p>
<p>urban areas, not just in the capital, by the way.</p>
<p>And Putin had to, as it were, come up with a new way to fix his popularity, which happened</p>
<p>to be the annexation of Crimea, from which he got a very significant bump.</p>
<p>However, the trend is back in the other direction.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s diminishing again, although it&rsquo;s still high relative to other leaders around the</p>
<p>world.</p>
<p>So I wouldn&rsquo;t say that he&rsquo;s unpopular with the mass in Russia.</p>
<p>There is some popularity there, there is some success, but I would say it&rsquo;s tough for us</p>
<p>to gauge because of the lack of alternatives.</p>
<p>And Putin is unpopular inside the state administration.</p>
<p>At every level, the bureaucracy of the leadership.</p>
<p>Because those people are well informed, and they understand that the country is declining,</p>
<p>that the human capital is declining, the infrastructure is declining, the economy is not really growing,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not really diversifying, Russia&rsquo;s not investing in its future.</p>
<p>The state officials understand all of that, and then they see that the Putin clique is</p>
<p>stealing everything in sight.</p>
<p>So between the failure to invest in a future and the corruption of a narrow group around</p>
<p>the president, there&rsquo;s disillusionment in the state apparatus because they see this</p>
<p>more clearly or more closely than the mass of the population.</p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t necessarily yet oppose this in public because they&rsquo;re people, they have families,</p>
<p>they have careers, they have children who want to go to school or want a job.</p>
<p>And so there are constraints on their ability to oppose the regime based upon what we might</p>
<p>call cowardice or other people might call realism.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how courageous people can be when their family, children, career are on</p>
<p>the line.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s very interesting dynamic to see the disillusionment inside the government with</p>
<p>the president, which is not yet fully public for the most part, but could become public.</p>
<p>And once again, if there&rsquo;s an alternative, if an alternative appears, things could shift</p>
<p>quickly.</p>
<p>And that alternative could come from inside the regime.</p>
<p>From inside the regime.</p>
<p>But the leadership, the party, the people that are now, as you&rsquo;re saying, opposed to</p>
<p>Putin, nevertheless, maybe you can correct me, but it feels like there&rsquo;s, structurally</p>
<p>is deeply corrupt.</p>
<p>So each of the people we&rsquo;re talking about are, don&rsquo;t feel like a George Washington.</p>
<p>Once again, the circumstances don&rsquo;t permit them to act that way necessarily, right?</p>
<p>George Washington did great things, but in certain circumstances.</p>
<p>A lot of the state officials in Russia for certain are corrupt.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no question.</p>
<p>Many of them, however, are patriotic and many of them feel badly about where the country</p>
<p>has been going.</p>
<p>They would prefer that the country was less corrupt.</p>
<p>They would prefer that there were greater investment in all sorts of areas of Russia.</p>
<p>They might even themselves steal less if they could be guaranteed that everybody else would</p>
<p>steal less.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a deep and abiding patriotism inside Russia, as well as inside the Russian regime.</p>
<p>So they understand that Putin in many ways rescued the Russian state from the chaos of</p>
<p>the 1990s.</p>
<p>They understand that Russia was in very bad shape as an incoherent failing state almost</p>
<p>when Putin took over and that he did some important things for Russia&rsquo;s stability and</p>
<p>consolidation.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also some appreciation that Putin stood up to the West and stood up to more</p>
<p>powerful countries and regained a sense of pride and maneuverability for Russia in the</p>
<p>international system.</p>
<p>People appreciate that and it&rsquo;s real.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not imagined that Putin accomplished that.</p>
<p>The problem is the methods that he accomplished it with.</p>
<p>He used the kind of methods, that is to say, taking other people&rsquo;s property, putting other</p>
<p>people in jail for political reasons.</p>
<p>He used the kind of methods that are not conducive to long term growth and stability.</p>
<p>So he fixed the problem, but he fixed the problem and then created even bigger long</p>
<p>term problems potentially.</p>
<p>And moreover, all authoritarian regimes that use those methods are tempted to keep using</p>
<p>them and using them and using them until they&rsquo;re the only ones who are the beneficiaries and</p>
<p>the group narrows and narrows.</p>
<p>The elite gets smaller and narrower.</p>
<p>The interest groups get excluded from power and their ability to continue enjoying the</p>
<p>fruits of the system and the resentment grows.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s the situation we have in Russia is a place that is stuck.</p>
<p>It was to a certain extent rescued.</p>
<p>It was rescued with methods that were not conducive to long term success and stability.</p>
<p>The rescue you&rsquo;re referring to is the sort of the economic growth when Putin first took</p>
<p>office.</p>
<p>Yes, they had 10 years.</p>
<p>They had a full decade of an average of 7% growth a year, which was phenomenal and is</p>
<p>not attributable predominantly to oil prices.</p>
<p>During President Putin&rsquo;s first term as president, the average price of oil was $35 a barrel.</p>
<p>During his second term as president, the average price was $70 a barrel.</p>
<p>So during those two terms, when Russia was growing at about 7% a year, oil prices were</p>
<p>averaging somewhere around $50 a barrel, which is fine, but is not the reason because later</p>
<p>on when oil prices were over $100 a barrel, Russia stagnated.</p>
<p>So the initial growth, do you think Putin deserves some credit for that?</p>
<p>Yes, he does because he introduced some important liberalizing measures.</p>
<p>He lowered taxes.</p>
<p>He allowed land to be bought and sold.</p>
<p>He deregulated many areas of the economy.</p>
<p>And so there was a kind of entrepreneurial burst that was partly attributable, partly</p>
<p>attributable to government policy during his first term.</p>
<p>But also he was consolidating political power.</p>
<p>And as I said, the methods he used overall for the long term were not able to continue</p>
<p>sustain that success.</p>
<p>In addition, we have to remember that China played a really big role in the success of</p>
<p>Russia in the first two terms of Putin&rsquo;s presidency because China&rsquo;s phenomenal growth created</p>
<p>insatiable demand for just about everything that the Soviet Union used to produce.</p>
<p>So fertilizers, cement, fill in the blank, chemicals, metals, China had insatiable demand</p>
<p>for everything the Soviet Union once produced.</p>
<p>And so China&rsquo;s raising of global demand overall brought Soviet era industry back from the</p>
<p>dead.</p>
<p>And so there was something that happened.</p>
<p>Soviet era industry fell off a cliff in the 1990s.</p>
<p>There was a decline in manufacturing and industrial production greater than in the Great Depression</p>
<p>in the US.</p>
<p>But a lot of that came back online in the 2000s.</p>
<p>And that had to do with China&rsquo;s phenomenal growth.</p>
<p>The trade between China and Russia was not always direct.</p>
<p>So this was an indirect effect.</p>
<p>But raising global prices for the commodities and the products, the kind of lower end, lower</p>
<p>value products in manufacturing, not high end stuff, but lower end stuff like steel</p>
<p>or iron or cement or fertilizer, where the value added is not spectacular, but nonetheless,</p>
<p>which had been destroyed by the 1990s and after the Soviet collapse, this was brought</p>
<p>back to life.</p>
<p>Now, you can do that once.</p>
<p>You can bring Soviet era industry back to life once.</p>
<p>And that happened during Putin&rsquo;s first two terms, in addition to the liberalizing policies,</p>
<p>which spurred entrepreneurialism in some small and medium business.</p>
<p>The crash of the ruble in 1998, which made Russian products much cheaper abroad and made</p>
<p>imports much more expensive, also facilitated the resuscitation, the revival of domestic</p>
<p>manufacturing.</p>
<p>So all of this came together for that spectacular 10 year, 7% on average economic growth.</p>
<p>And moreover, people&rsquo;s wages after inflation, their disposable income grew more even than</p>
<p>GDP grew.</p>
<p>So disposable income after inflation, that is real income, was growing greater than 7%.</p>
<p>In some cases, 10% a year.</p>
<p>So there was a boom, and the Russian people felt it, and it happened during Putin&rsquo;s first</p>
<p>two terms, and people were grateful, rightly so, for that.</p>
<p>And those who don&rsquo;t want to give Putin credit, give oil prices all the credit.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t think that oil prices can explain this.</p>
<p>Having said that, that doesn&rsquo;t mean that this was sustainable over the long term.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve briefly mentioned, sort of implying the possibility, you know, Stalin held power</p>
<p>for, let&rsquo;s say, 30 years.</p>
<p>You briefly mentioned that as a question, will Putin be able to beat that record, to</p>
<p>beat that?</p>
<p>So can you talk about your sense of, is it possible that Putin holds power for that kind</p>
<p>of duration?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s hope not.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s hope not for Russia&rsquo;s sake.</p>
<p>The primary victims of President Putin&rsquo;s power are Russians.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not Ukrainians, although to a certain extent, Ukraine has suffered because of Putin&rsquo;s</p>
<p>actions.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re not Americans, they&rsquo;re Russians.</p>
<p>Moreover, Russia has lost a great deal of human talent.</p>
<p>Tens of millions of people have left Russia since 1991 overall.</p>
<p>Somewhere between five and 10 million people have left the country and are beyond the borders</p>
<p>of the former Soviet Union.</p>
<p>So they left the Soviet space entirely.</p>
<p>Moreover, the people who left are not the poor people.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not the uneducated.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not the losers.</p>
<p>The people who&rsquo;ve left are the more dynamic parts of the population.</p>
<p>The better educated, the more entrepreneurial.</p>
<p>So that human capital loss that Russia has suffered is phenomenal.</p>
<p>And in fact, right here where we&rsquo;re sitting at MIT, we have examples of people who are</p>
<p>qualified good enough for MIT and have left Russia to come to MIT.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re looking at one of them.</p>
<p>And the other aspect, just to quickly comment, is those same people like me, I&rsquo;m not welcome</p>
<p>back.</p>
<p>No, you&rsquo;re not under the current regime.</p>
<p>It was a big loss for Russia if you&rsquo;re patriotic, but not from the point of view of the Putin</p>
<p>regime.</p>
<p>That has to do, also factors into popularity.</p>
<p>If the people who don&rsquo;t like you leave, they&rsquo;re not there to complain, to protest, to vote</p>
<p>against you.</p>
<p>And so your opposition declines when you let them leave.</p>
<p>However, it&rsquo;s very costly in human capital terms.</p>
<p>Hemorrhaging that much human capital is damaging, it&rsquo;s self damaging.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve seen it accelerate.</p>
<p>It was already high, but we&rsquo;ve seen it accelerate in the last seven to eight years of President</p>
<p>Putin&rsquo;s rule.</p>
<p>And those people are not going back of their own volition.</p>
<p>But even if they wanted to go back, as you just said, they&rsquo;d be unwelcome.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a big cost to pay for this regime.</p>
<p>And so whatever benefits this regime might or might not have given to the country, the</p>
<p>disadvantages, the downside, the costs are also really high.</p>
<p>So we don&rsquo;t want Putin lasting in power as long as Stalin.</p>
<p>It would be better if Russia were able to choose among options, to choose a new leader</p>
<p>among options.</p>
<p>Many people speculate that President Putin will name a successor the way Yeltsin named</p>
<p>Putin as his successor, President Boris Yeltsin.</p>
<p>And then Putin will leave the stage and allow the successor to take over.</p>
<p>That might seem like a good solution, but once again, we don&rsquo;t need a system where you</p>
<p>hang on for as long as possible and then nominate who&rsquo;s going to take over.</p>
<p>We need a system that has the kind of corrective mechanisms that democracies and markets have</p>
<p>along with rule of law.</p>
<p>A corrective mechanism is really important because all leaders make mistakes.</p>
<p>But when you can&rsquo;t correct for the mistakes, then the mistakes get compounded.</p>
<p>Putin could well, he seems to be healthy, he could well last as many years as Stalin.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to predict because events intercede sometimes and create circumstances that are</p>
<p>unforeseen and leaders get overthrown or have a heart attack or whatever.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a palace insurrection where ambitious leaders on the inside for both personal power</p>
<p>and patriotic reasons try to push aside an aging leader.</p>
<p>There are many scenarios in which Putin could not last that long, but unfortunately, right</p>
<p>now, you could also imagine potentially him lasting that long, which as I said, is not</p>
<p>an outcome if you&rsquo;re patriotic about Russia, it&rsquo;s not an outcome you would wish out to</p>
<p>the country.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s, I guess, a very difficult question, but what practically do you feel is a way</p>
<p>out of the Putin regime, is a way out of the corruption that&rsquo;s deeply underlies the state?</p>
<p>Is a, if you look from a history perspective, is a revolution required?</p>
<p>Is violence required?</p>
<p>Is from violence within or external to the country?</p>
<p>Do you see, or is a powerful, is a inspiring leader enough to step in and bring democracy</p>
<p>and kind of the free world to Russia?</p>
<p>So Russia is not a failed country.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a middle income country with tremendous potential and has proven many times in the</p>
<p>past that when it gets in a bad way, it can reverse its trajectory.</p>
<p>Moreover, violence is rarely ever a solution.</p>
<p>Violence rarely, it may break an existing trend, but it&rsquo;s rare that violence produces</p>
<p>a nonviolent, sustainable, positive outcome.</p>
<p>It happens, but it doesn&rsquo;t happen frequently.</p>
<p>Mental upheaval is not a way always to institutionalize a better path forward because you need institutions.</p>
<p>People can protest as they did throughout the Middle East, and the protests didn&rsquo;t necessarily</p>
<p>lead to better systems because the step from protest to new, strong, consolidated institutions</p>
<p>is a colossal leap, not a small step.</p>
<p>What we need and what we see from history and situations like this is a group within</p>
<p>the power structures, which is a patriotic that sees things going down.</p>
<p>That is to say that sees things not being developing relative to neighbors, relative</p>
<p>to richer countries, relative to more successful countries, and they want to change the trajectory</p>
<p>of Russia.</p>
<p>And if they can, in a coalition fashion, unseat the current regime for a new power sharing</p>
<p>arrangement, which once again can be frustrating because you can&rsquo;t do changes immediately,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t do things overnight, but that&rsquo;s the point.</p>
<p>Constraints on your ability to change everything immediately and to force change overnight</p>
<p>is what leads to long term success potentially.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the sustainability of change.</p>
<p>So Russia needs stronger institutions.</p>
<p>It needs court system as well as democratic institutions.</p>
<p>It needs functioning, open, dynamic markets rather than monopolies.</p>
<p>It needs meritocracy and banks to award loans on the basis of business plans, not on the</p>
<p>basis of political criteria or corrupt bribery or whatever it might be.</p>
<p>So Russia needs those kind of functioning institutions that take time, are sometimes</p>
<p>slow, don&rsquo;t lead to a revolutionary transformation, but lead to potentially long term sustainable</p>
<p>growth without upheaval, without violence, without getting into a situation where all</p>
<p>of a sudden you need a miracle again.</p>
<p>Every time Russia seems to need a miracle, and that&rsquo;s the problem, the solution would</p>
<p>be not needing a miracle.</p>
<p>Now having said that, the potential is there.</p>
<p>The civilization that we call Russia is amazingly impressive.</p>
<p>It has delivered world class culture, world class science.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a great power.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a great power with a strong base right now, but nonetheless it is a great power</p>
<p>as it acts in the world.</p>
<p>So I wouldn&rsquo;t underestimate Russia&rsquo;s abilities here and I wouldn&rsquo;t write off Russia.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see it under the current regime, a renewal of the country.</p>
<p>But if we can have from within the regime an evolution rather than a revolution in a</p>
<p>positive direction, and maybe get a George Washington figure who is strong enough to</p>
<p>push through institutionalization rather than personalism.</p>
<p>So if I could ask about one particular individual, it&rsquo;d be just interesting to get your comment,</p>
<p>but also as a representative of potential leaders, I just on this podcast talked to</p>
<p>Gary Kasparov, who I&rsquo;m not sure if you&rsquo;re familiar with his, his ongoings.</p>
<p>So besides being a world class chess player, he&rsquo;s also a very outspoken activist, sort</p>
<p>of seeing Putin, truly seeing Putin as an enemy of the free world of democracy, of balanced</p>
<p>government in Russia.</p>
<p>What do you think of people like him specifically, or just people like him trying as leaders</p>
<p>to step in, to run for president, to symbolize a new chapter in Russia&rsquo;s future?</p>
<p>So we don&rsquo;t need individuals.</p>
<p>Some individuals are very impressive and they have courage and they protest and they criticize</p>
<p>and they organize.</p>
<p>We need institutions.</p>
<p>We need a Duma or a parliament that functions.</p>
<p>We need a court system that functions.</p>
<p>That is to say where there are a separation of powers, impartial professional civil service,</p>
<p>impartial professional judiciary.</p>
<p>Those are the things Russia needs.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s rare that you get that from an individual, no matter how impressive, right?</p>
<p>We had Andrei Sakharov, who was an extraordinary individual, who developed the hydrogen bomb</p>
<p>under a Soviet regime, was a world class physicist, was then upset about how his scientific knowledge</p>
<p>and scientific achievements were being put to use and rebelled to try to put limits,</p>
<p>constraints, civilizing humane limits and constraints on some of the implications of</p>
<p>his extraordinary science.</p>
<p>But Sakharov, even if he had become the leader of the country, which he did not become, he</p>
<p>was more of a moral or spiritual leader, it still wouldn&rsquo;t have given you a judiciary.</p>
<p>It still wouldn&rsquo;t have given you a civil service.</p>
<p>It still wouldn&rsquo;t have given you a Duma or functioning parliament.</p>
<p>You need a leader in coalition with other leaders.</p>
<p>You need a bunch of leaders, a whole group, and they have to be divided a little bit so</p>
<p>that not one of them can destroy all the others.</p>
<p>And they have to be interested in creating institutions, not solely or predominantly</p>
<p>in their personal power.</p>
<p>And so I have no objection to outstanding individuals and to the work that they do.</p>
<p>But I think in institutional terms, and they need to think that way too in order to be</p>
<p>successful.</p>
<p>So if we go back to the echoes of that after the Russian Revolution with Stalin, with Lenin</p>
<p>and Stalin, maybe you can correct me, but there was a group of people there in that</p>
<p>same kind of way looking to establish institutions that were beautifully built around an ideology</p>
<p>that they believed is good for the world.</p>
<p>So sort of echoing that idea of what we&rsquo;re talking about, what Russia needs now, can</p>
<p>you, first of all, you&rsquo;ve described a fascinating thought, which is Stalin is having amassed</p>
<p>arguably more power than any man in history, which is an interesting thing to think about.</p>
<p>But can you tell about his journey to getting that power after the Russian Revolution?</p>
<p>How does that perhaps echo to our current discussion about institutions and so on?</p>
<p>And just in general, the story I think is fascinating of how one man is able to get</p>
<p>more power than any other man in history.</p>
<p>It is a great story, not necessarily from a moral point of view, but if you&rsquo;re interested</p>
<p>in power, for sure it&rsquo;s an incredible story.</p>
<p>So we have to remember that Stalin is also a product of circumstances, not solely his</p>
<p>own individual drive, which is very strong.</p>
<p>For example, World War I breaks the czarist regime, the czarist order, imperial Russian</p>
<p>state.</p>
<p>Stalin has no participation whatsoever in World War I.</p>
<p>He spends World War I in exile in Siberia.</p>
<p>Until the downfall of the czarist autocracy in February 1917, Stalin is in Eastern Siberian</p>
<p>exile.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s only able to leave Eastern Siberia when that regime falls.</p>
<p>He never fights in the war.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s called up briefly towards the end of the war and is disqualified on physical grounds</p>
<p>because of physical deformities from being drafted.</p>
<p>The war continues after the czarist regime has been toppled in the capital and there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>been a revolution.</p>
<p>The war continues and that war is very radicalizing.</p>
<p>The peasants begin to seize the land after the czar falls, essentially destroying much</p>
<p>of the gentry class.</p>
<p>Stalin has nothing to do with that.</p>
<p>The peasants have their own revolution, seizing the land, not in law, but in fact, de facto</p>
<p>not de jure land ownership.</p>
<p>So there are these really large processes underway that Stalin is alive during, but</p>
<p>not a driver of.</p>
<p>The most improbable thing happens, which is a very small group of people around the figure</p>
<p>of Vladimir Lenin announces that it has seized power.</p>
<p>Now by this time in October 1917, the government that has replaced the czar, the so called</p>
<p>provisional government, has failed.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s not so much power to seize from the provisional government.</p>
<p>What Lenin does is he does a coup on the left.</p>
<p>That is to say, Soviets or councils, as we would call them in English, which represent</p>
<p>people&rsquo;s power or the masses participating in politics, a kind of radical grassroots</p>
<p>democracy are extremely popular all over the country and not dominated by any one group,</p>
<p>but predominantly socialist or predominantly leftist.</p>
<p>Russia has an election during the war, a free and fair election for the most part, despite</p>
<p>the war at the end of 1917, in December 1917, and three quarters plus of the country votes</p>
<p>socialist in some form or another.</p>
<p>So the battle was over the definition of socialism and who had the right to participate in defining</p>
<p>socialism, not only what it would be, but who had the right to decide.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a coup by Lenin&rsquo;s group known as the Bolsheviks against all the other socialists.</p>
<p>And so Lenin declares a seizure of power whereby the old government has failed, people&rsquo;s power,</p>
<p>the councils known as the Soviets are going to take their place, and Lenin seizes power</p>
<p>in the name of the Soviets.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a coup against the left, against the rest of the left, not against the provisional</p>
<p>government that has replaced the czar, which has already failed.</p>
<p>And so Stalin is able to come to power along with Lenin in this crazy seizure of power</p>
<p>on the left against the rest of the left in October 1917, which we know is the October</p>
<p>Revolution, and I call the October coup as many other historians call.</p>
<p>The October Revolution happened after the seizure of power.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s interesting about this episode is that the leftists who seize power in the name of</p>
<p>the Soviets, in the name of the masses, in the name of people&rsquo;s power, they retain their</p>
<p>hold.</p>
<p>Many times in history, there&rsquo;s a seizure of power by the left, and they fail.</p>
<p>They collapse.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re cleaned out by an army or what we call forces of order, by counter revolutionary</p>
<p>forces.</p>
<p>Lenin&rsquo;s revolution, Lenin&rsquo;s coup is successful.</p>
<p>It is able to hold power, not just seize power.</p>
<p>They win a civil war, and they&rsquo;re entrenched in the heart of the country already by 1921.</p>
<p>Stalin is part of that group.</p>
<p>Lenin needs somebody to run.</p>
<p>This new regime in the kind of nitty gritty way, Lenin is the leader, the undisputed leader</p>
<p>in the Bolshevik party, which changes their name to communists in 1918.</p>
<p>He makes Stalin the general secretary of the communist party.</p>
<p>He creates a new position, which hadn&rsquo;t existed before, a kind of day to day political manager,</p>
<p>a right hand man.</p>
<p>Not because Lenin is looking to replace himself.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s looking to institutionalize a helpmate, a right hand man.</p>
<p>He does this in the spring of 1922.</p>
<p>Stalin is named to this position, which Lenin has created expressly for Stalin.</p>
<p>So there has been a coup on the left whereby the Bolsheviks who become communists have</p>
<p>seized power against the rest of the socialists and anarchists and the entire left.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s an institutionalization of a position known as general secretary of the</p>
<p>communist party, right hand man of Lenin.</p>
<p>Less than six weeks after Lenin has created this position and installed Stalin, Lenin</p>
<p>has a stroke, a major stroke, and never really returns as a full actor to power before he</p>
<p>dies of a fourth stroke in January 1924.</p>
<p>So a position is created for Stalin to run things on Lenin&rsquo;s behalf.</p>
<p>And then Lenin has a stroke.</p>
<p>And so Stalin now has this new position general secretary, but he&rsquo;s the right hand of a person</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s no longer exercising day to day control over affairs.</p>
<p>Stalin then uses this new position to create a personal dictatorship inside the Bolshevik</p>
<p>dictatorship, which is the remarkable story I tried to tell.</p>
<p>So is there anything nefarious about any of what you just described?</p>
<p>So it seems conveniently that the position is created just for Stalin.</p>
<p>There was a few other brilliant people, arguably more brilliant than Stalin in the vicinity</p>
<p>of Lenin.</p>
<p>Why was Stalin chosen?</p>
<p>Why did Lenin all of a sudden fall ill?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s perhaps a conspiratorial question, but is there anything nefarious about any of this</p>
<p>historical trajectory to power that Stalin took in creating the personal dictatorship?</p>
<p>So history is full of contingency and surprise.</p>
<p>After something happens, we all think it&rsquo;s inevitable.</p>
<p>It had to happen that way.</p>
<p>Everything was leading up to it.</p>
<p>So Hitler seizes power in Germany in 1933, and the Nazi regime gets institutionalized</p>
<p>by several of his moves after being named chancellor.</p>
<p>And so all German history becomes a story of the Nazi rise to power, Hitler&rsquo;s rise to</p>
<p>power.</p>
<p>Every trend tendency is bent into that outcome.</p>
<p>Things which don&rsquo;t seem related to that outcome all of a sudden get bent in that direction.</p>
<p>And other trends that were going on are no longer examined because they didn&rsquo;t lead to</p>
<p>that outcome.</p>
<p>But Hitler&rsquo;s becoming chancellor of Germany in 1933 was not inevitable.</p>
<p>It was contingent.</p>
<p>He was offered the position by the traditional conservatives.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s part of the radical right and the traditional right named him chancellor.</p>
<p>The Nazi party never outright won an election that was free and fair before Hitler came</p>
<p>to power.</p>
<p>And in fact, its votes on the eve of Hitler becoming chancellor declined relative to the</p>
<p>previous election.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s contingency in history, and so Lenin&rsquo;s illness, his stroke, the neurological</p>
<p>and blood problems that he had were not a structure in history.</p>
<p>In other words, if Lenin had been a healthier figure, Stalin might never have become the</p>
<p>Stalin that we know.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not to say that all history is accidental, just that we need to relate the structural,</p>
<p>the larger structural factors to the contingent factors.</p>
<p>Why did Lenin pick Stalin?</p>
<p>Well, Stalin was a very effective organizer, and the position was an organizational position.</p>
<p>Stalin could get things done.</p>
<p>He would carry out assignments no matter how difficult.</p>
<p>He wouldn&rsquo;t complain that it was hard work or too much work.</p>
<p>He wouldn&rsquo;t go off womanizing and drinking and ignore his responsibilities.</p>
<p>Lenin chose Stalin among other options because he thought Stalin was the better option.</p>
<p>Once again, he wasn&rsquo;t choosing his successor because he didn&rsquo;t know he was going to have</p>
<p>this stroke.</p>
<p>Lenin had some serious illnesses, but he had never had a major stroke before.</p>
<p>So the choice was made based upon Stalin&rsquo;s organizational skills and promise against</p>
<p>the others who were in the regime.</p>
<p>Now, they can seem more brilliant than Stalin, but he was more effective, and I&rsquo;m not sure</p>
<p>they were very brilliant.</p>
<p>Well, he was exceptionally competent actually at the tasks for running a government, the</p>
<p>executive branch, right, of a dictator.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>He turned out to be very adept at being a dictator.</p>
<p>And so if he had been chosen by Lenin and had not been very good, he would have been</p>
<p>pushed aside by others.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You can get a position by accident.</p>
<p>You can be named because you&rsquo;re someone&rsquo;s friend or someone&rsquo;s relative, but to hold</p>
<p>that position, to hold that position in difficult circumstances, and then to build effectively</p>
<p>a superpower on all that bloodshed, right, you have to be skilled in some way.</p>
<p>It can&rsquo;t be just the accident that brings you to power because if accident brings you</p>
<p>to power, it won&rsquo;t last.</p>
<p>Just like we discovered with Putin, he had some qualities that we didn&rsquo;t foresee at the</p>
<p>beginning, and he&rsquo;s been able to hold power, not just be named.</p>
<p>Now, Putin and Stalin are very different people.</p>
<p>These are very different regimes.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t put them in the same sentence.</p>
<p>My point is not that one resembles the other.</p>
<p>My point is that when people come to power for contingent reasons, they don&rsquo;t stay in</p>
<p>power unless they&rsquo;re able to manage it.</p>
<p>And Stalin was able to build a personal dictatorship inside that dictatorship.</p>
<p>He was cunning, he was ruthless, and he was a workaholic.</p>
<p>He was very diligent.</p>
<p>He had a phenomenal memory, and so he could remember people&rsquo;s names and faces and events.</p>
<p>And this was very advantageous for him as he built the machine that became the Soviet</p>
<p>state and bureaucracy.</p>
<p>One of the things, maybe you can correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong, what you&rsquo;ve made me realize</p>
<p>is this wasn&rsquo;t some kind of manipulative personality trying to gain more power solely, like kind</p>
<p>of an evil picture of a person, but he truly believed in communism.</p>
<p>As far as I can understand, again, you can correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong, but he wanted to</p>
<p>build a better world by infusing communism into the country, perhaps into the whole world.</p>
<p>So maybe my question is what role does communism as an idea, as an ideology play in all of</p>
<p>this?</p>
<p>What was the power in the people of the time, in the Russian people, actually just the whole</p>
<p>20th century?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>Stalin was a true believer, and this is very important.</p>
<p>He was also hungry for power and for personal power, but just as you said, not for power&rsquo;s</p>
<p>sake, not only for power.</p>
<p>He was interested in enacting communism in reality and also in building a powerful state.</p>
<p>He was a statist, a traditional Russian statist in the imperial sense, and this won him a</p>
<p>lot of followers.</p>
<p>The fact that they knew he was a hardcore true believing communist won him a lot of</p>
<p>followers among the communists, and the fact that he was a hardcore defender of Russian</p>
<p>state interests now in the Soviet guise also won him a lot of followers.</p>
<p>Sometimes those groups overlapped, the communists and the Russian patriots, and sometimes they</p>
<p>were completely different groups, but both of them shared an admiration for Stalin&rsquo;s</p>
<p>dedication to those goals and his abilities to enact them.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s very important to understand that however thirsty he was for power, and he was</p>
<p>very thirsty for power, that he was also driven by ideals.</p>
<p>Now I don&rsquo;t necessarily think that everyone around Stalin shared those ideals.</p>
<p>We have to be careful not to make everybody into a communist true believer, not to make</p>
<p>everybody into a great statist Russian patriot, but they were widespread and powerful attractions</p>
<p>for a lot of people.</p>
<p>And so Stalin&rsquo;s ability to communicate to people that he was dedicated to those pursuits</p>
<p>and his ability to drive towards them were part of his appeal.</p>
<p>Where he also resorted to manipulation, he also resorted to violence, he lied, he spoke</p>
<p>out of all sides of his mouth, he slandered other people, he sabotaged potential rivals.</p>
<p>He used every underhanded method, and then some, in order to build his personal dictatorship.</p>
<p>Now he justified this, as you said, by appeals to communism and to Soviet power.</p>
<p>To himself as well too.</p>
<p>To himself and to others.</p>
<p>And so he justified it in his own mind and to others, but certainly any means, right,</p>
<p>were acceptable to him to achieve these ends.</p>
<p>And he identified his personal power with communism and with Russian glory in the world.</p>
<p>So he felt that he was the only one who could be trusted, who could be relied upon to build</p>
<p>these things.</p>
<p>Now, we put ourselves back in that time period.</p>
<p>The Great Depression was a very difficult time for the capitalist system.</p>
<p>There was mass unemployment, a lot of hardship, fascism, Nazism, Imperial Japan.</p>
<p>There were a lot of associations that were negative with the kind of capitalist system</p>
<p>that was not a hundred percent, not a monolith, but had a lot of authoritarian incarnations.</p>
<p>There was imperialism, colonies that even the democratic rule of law capitalist states</p>
<p>had non democratic, non rule of law colonies under their rule.</p>
<p>So the image and reality of capitalism during that time period between World War I and World</p>
<p>War II was very different from how it would become later.</p>
<p>And so in that time period, in that interwar conjuncture after World War I, before World</p>
<p>War II, communism held some appeal inside the Soviet Union for sure, but even outside</p>
<p>the Soviet Union because the image and reality of capitalism disappointed many people.</p>
<p>Now, in the end, communism was significantly worse.</p>
<p>Many more victims and the system of course would eventually implode.</p>
<p>But nonetheless, there were real problems that communism tried to address.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t solve those problems.</p>
<p>It was not a solution, but it didn&rsquo;t come out of nowhere.</p>
<p>It came out of the context of that interwar period.</p>
<p>And so Stalin&rsquo;s rule, some people saw it as potentially a better option than imperialism,</p>
<p>fascism and Great Depression.</p>
<p>Having said that, they were wrong.</p>
<p>It turned out that Stalin wasn&rsquo;t a better alternative to markets and private property</p>
<p>and rule of law and democracy.</p>
<p>However, that didn&rsquo;t become clearer to people until after World War II, after Nazism had</p>
<p>been defeated, Imperial Japan had been defeated, a fascist Italy had been defeated and decolonization</p>
<p>had happened around the world, and there was a middle class economic boom in the period</p>
<p>from the late 40s through the 70s that created a kind of mass middle class in many societies.</p>
<p>So capitalism rose from the ashes as it were, and this changed the game for Stalin and communism.</p>
<p>Capitalism is about an alternative to capitalism, and if that alternative is not superior, there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>no reason for communism to exist.</p>
<p>But if capitalism is in foul odor, if people have a bad opinion, a strong critique of capitalism,</p>
<p>there can be appeal to alternatives, and that&rsquo;s kind of what happened with Stalin&rsquo;s rule.</p>
<p>But after World War II, the context changed a lot, capitalism was very different, much</p>
<p>more successful, nonviolent compared to what it was in the interwar period.</p>
<p>And the Soviet Union had a tough time competing against that new context.</p>
<p>Now today we see similarly that the image and reality of capitalism is on the question</p>
<p>again, which leads some people to find an answer in socialism as an alternative.</p>
<p>So you just kind of painted a beautiful picture of comparison.</p>
<p>This is the way we think about ideologies because we, is what&rsquo;s working better.</p>
<p>Do you separate in your mind the ideals of communism to the Stalinist implementation</p>
<p>of communism, and again, capitalism and American implementation of capitalism?</p>
<p>And as we look at now the 21st century where, yes, this idea of socialism being a potential</p>
<p>political system that we would, or economic system we would operate under in the United</p>
<p>States rising up again as an idea.</p>
<p>So how do we think about that again in the 21st century, about these ideas, fundamental</p>
<p>deep ideas of communism and capitalism?</p>
<p>Yeah, so in the Marxist schema, there was something called feudalism, which was supposedly</p>
<p>destroyed by the bourgeoisie who created capitalism.</p>
<p>And then the working class was supposed to destroy capitalism and create socialism.</p>
<p>But socialism wasn&rsquo;t the end stage.</p>
<p>The end stage was going to be communism.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why the communist party in the Soviet Union first built socialism transcending capitalism.</p>
<p>The next stage was socialism and the end game, the final stage was communism.</p>
<p>So their version of socialism was derived from Marx.</p>
<p>And Marx argued that the problem was capitalism had been very beneficial for a while.</p>
<p>It had produced greater wealth and greater opportunity than feudalism had.</p>
<p>But then it had come to serve only the narrow interests of the so called bourgeoisie or</p>
<p>the capitalists themselves.</p>
<p>And so for humanity&rsquo;s sake, the universal class, the working class needed to overthrow</p>
<p>capitalism in order for greater productivity, greater wealth to be produced for all of humanity</p>
<p>to flourish and on a higher level.</p>
<p>So you couldn&rsquo;t have socialism unless you destroyed capitalism.</p>
<p>So that meant no markets, no private property, no so called parliaments or bourgeois parliaments</p>
<p>as they were called.</p>
<p>So you got socialism in Marx&rsquo;s schema by transcending, by eliminating capitalism.</p>
<p>Now Marx also called for freedom.</p>
<p>He said that this elimination of markets and private property and bourgeois parliaments</p>
<p>would produce greater freedom in addition to greater abundance.</p>
<p>However, everywhere this was tried, it produced tyranny and mass violence, death and shortages.</p>
<p>Everywhere it was tried.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no exception in historical terms.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s very interesting.</p>
<p>Marx insisted that capitalism had to be eliminated.</p>
<p>You couldn&rsquo;t have markets.</p>
<p>Markets were chaos.</p>
<p>You needed planning.</p>
<p>You couldn&rsquo;t have hiring of wage labor.</p>
<p>That was wage slavery.</p>
<p>You couldn&rsquo;t have private property because that was a form of theft.</p>
<p>So in the Marxist scheme, somehow you were going to eliminate capitalism and get to freedom.</p>
<p>It turned out you didn&rsquo;t get to freedom.</p>
<p>So then people said, well, you can&rsquo;t blame Marx because he said we needed freedom.</p>
<p>He was pro freedom.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s kind of like dropping a nuclear bomb.</p>
<p>You say you&rsquo;re going to drop a nuclear bomb, but you want to minimize civilian casualties.</p>
<p>So the dropping of the nuclear bomb is the elimination of markets, private property and</p>
<p>parliaments.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re going to bring freedom or you&rsquo;re going to minimize civilian casualties.</p>
<p>So you drop the nuclear bomb, you eliminate the capitalism and you get famine, deportation,</p>
<p>no constraints on executive power and not abundance, but shortages.</p>
<p>And people say, well, that&rsquo;s not what Mark said.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not what I said.</p>
<p>I said, I wanted to minimize civilian casualties.</p>
<p>The nuclear bomb goes off and there&rsquo;s mass civilian casualties.</p>
<p>And you keep saying, but I said, drop the bomb, but minimize civilian casualties.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s where we are.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s history, not philosophy.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m speaking about historical examples, all the cases that we have.</p>
<p>Marx was not a theorist of inequality.</p>
<p>Marx was a theorist of alienation, of dehumanization, of fundamental constraints or what he called</p>
<p>fetters on productivity and on wealth, which he all attributed to capitalism.</p>
<p>Marx wasn&rsquo;t bothered by inequality.</p>
<p>He was bothered by something deeper, something worse, right?</p>
<p>Those socialists who figured this out, who understood that if you drop the nuclear bomb,</p>
<p>there was no way to minimize civilian casualties.</p>
<p>All socialists who came to understand that if you eliminated capitalism, markets, private</p>
<p>property and parliaments, if you eliminated that, you wouldn&rsquo;t get freedom.</p>
<p>Those Marxists, those socialists became what we would call social Democrats or people who</p>
<p>would use the state to regulate the market, not to eliminate the market.</p>
<p>They would use the state to redistribute income, not to destroy private property and markets.</p>
<p>And so this in the Marxist schema was apostasy because they were accepting markets and private</p>
<p>property.</p>
<p>They were accepting alienation and wage slavery.</p>
<p>They were accepting capitalism in principle, but they wanted to fix it.</p>
<p>They wanted to ameliorate.</p>
<p>They wanted to regulate.</p>
<p>And so they became what was denounced as revisionists, not true Marxists, not real revolutionaries,</p>
<p>but parliamentary road, parliamentarians.</p>
<p>We know this as normal politics, normal social democratic politics from the European case</p>
<p>or from the American case, but they are not asking to eliminate capitalism, blaming capitalism,</p>
<p>blaming markets and private property.</p>
<p>So this rift among the socialists, the ones who are for elimination of capitalism, transcending</p>
<p>capitalism, otherwise you could never, ever get to abundance and freedom in the Marxist</p>
<p>schema versus those who accept capitalism, but want to regulate and redistribute.</p>
<p>That rift on the left has been with us almost from the beginning.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a kind of civil war on the left between the Leninists and the social democrats or</p>
<p>the revisionists as they&rsquo;re known pejoratively by the Leninists.</p>
<p>We have the same confusion today in the world today where people also cite Marx saying capitalism</p>
<p>is a dead end and we need to drop that nuclear bomb and get freedom, get no civilian casualties</p>
<p>versus those who say, yes, there are inequities.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lack of equality of opportunity.</p>
<p>There are many other issues that we need to deal with and we can fix those issues.</p>
<p>We can regulate, we can redistribute.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not advocating this as a political position.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not taking a political position myself.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just saying that there&rsquo;s a confusion on the left between those who accept capitalism</p>
<p>and want to regulate it versus those who think capitalism is inherently evil and if we eliminate</p>
<p>it we&rsquo;ll get to a better world when in fact history shows that if you eliminate capitalism</p>
<p>you get to a worse world.</p>
<p>The problems might be real, but the solutions are worse.</p>
<p>From history&rsquo;s lessons, now we have deep painful lessons, but there&rsquo;s not that many of them.</p>
<p>You know, our history is relatively short as a human species.</p>
<p>Do we have a good answer on the left of Leninist, Marxist versus Social Democrat versus capitalism</p>
<p>versus any anarchy?</p>
<p>Do we have sufficient samples from history to make better decisions about the future</p>
<p>of our politics and economics?</p>
<p>For sure.</p>
<p>We have the American Revolution, which was a revolution not about class, not about workers,</p>
<p>not about a so called universal class of the working class, elimination of capitalism markets</p>
<p>and the bourgeoisie, but was about the category citizen.</p>
<p>It was about universal humanity where everyone in theory could be part of it as a citizen.</p>
<p>The revolution fell short of its own ideals.</p>
<p>Not everyone was a citizen.</p>
<p>For example, if you didn&rsquo;t own property, you were a male but didn&rsquo;t own property.</p>
<p>You didn&rsquo;t have full rights of a citizen.</p>
<p>If you were a female, whether you own property or not, you weren&rsquo;t a full citizen.</p>
<p>If you were imported from Africa against your will, you were a slave and not a citizen.</p>
<p>And so not everyone was afforded the rights in actuality that were declared in principle.</p>
<p>However, over time, the category citizen could expand and slaves could be emancipated and</p>
<p>they could get the right to vote.</p>
<p>They could become citizens.</p>
<p>Nonproperty owning males could get the right to vote and become full citizens.</p>
<p>Females could get the right to vote and become full citizens.</p>
<p>In fact, eventually my mother was able to get a credit card in her own name in the 1970s</p>
<p>without my father having to co sign the paperwork.</p>
<p>It took a long time.</p>
<p>But nonetheless, the category citizen can expand and it can become a universal category.</p>
<p>So we have that, the citizen universal humanity model of the American Revolution, which was</p>
<p>deeply flawed at the time it was introduced, but fixable over time.</p>
<p>We also had that separation of powers and constraint on executive power that we began</p>
<p>this conversation with.</p>
<p>That was also institutionalized in the American Revolution because they were afraid of tyranny.</p>
<p>They were afraid of unconstrained executive power.</p>
<p>So they built a system that would contain that, constrain it institutionally, not circumstantially.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a great gift.</p>
<p>Within that universal category of citizen, which has over time come closer to fulfilling</p>
<p>its original promise.</p>
<p>And within those institutional constraints, that separation of powers, constraint on executive</p>
<p>power, within that we&rsquo;ve developed what we might call normal politics, left right politics.</p>
<p>People can be in favor of redistribution, and government action and people can be in</p>
<p>favor of small government, hands off government, no redistribution or less redistribution.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the normal left right political spectrum, where you respect the institutions and separation</p>
<p>of powers.</p>
<p>And you respect the universal category of citizenship and equality before the law and</p>
<p>everything else.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see any problems with that whatsoever.</p>
<p>I see that as a great gift, not just to this country, but around the world and other places</p>
<p>besides the United States have developed this.</p>
<p>The problems arise at the extremes, the far left and the far right that don&rsquo;t recognize</p>
<p>the legitimacy either of capitalism or of democratic rule of law institutions.</p>
<p>And they want to eliminate constraints on executive power.</p>
<p>They want to control the public sphere or diminish the independence of the media.</p>
<p>They want to take away markets or private property and redistribution becomes something</p>
<p>bigger than just redistribution.</p>
<p>It becomes actually that original Marxist idea of transcending capitalism.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not bothered by the left or the right.</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;re normal and we should have that debate.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re a gigantic, diverse country of many different political points of view.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m troubled only by the extremes that are against the system qua system that want to</p>
<p>get rid of it and supposedly that will be the bright path to the future.</p>
<p>History tells us that the far left and the far right are wrong about that.</p>
<p>But once again, this doesn&rsquo;t mean that you have to be a social democrat.</p>
<p>You could be a libertarian.</p>
<p>You could be a conservative.</p>
<p>You could be a centrist.</p>
<p>You could be conservative on some issues and liberal on other issues.</p>
<p>All of that comes under what I would presume to be normal politics.</p>
<p>And I see that as the important corrective mechanism.</p>
<p>Normal politics and market economies, non monopolistic, open, free and dynamic market</p>
<p>economies.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like concentrations of power politically and I don&rsquo;t like concentrations of power economically.</p>
<p>I like competition in the political realm.</p>
<p>I like competition in the economic realm.</p>
<p>This is not perfect.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s constantly needs to be protected and reinvented and there are flaws that are fundamental</p>
<p>and need to be adjusted and addressed and everything else, especially equality of opportunity.</p>
<p>Equality of outcome is unreachable and is a mistake because it produces perverse and</p>
<p>unintended consequences.</p>
<p>Equality of outcome attempts, attempts to make people equal on the outcome side, but</p>
<p>attempts to make them more equal on the front end, on the opportunity side.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really, really important for a healthy society.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where we&rsquo;ve fallen down.</p>
<p>Our schools are not providing equality of opportunity for the majority of people in</p>
<p>all of our school systems.</p>
<p>And so I see problems there.</p>
<p>I see a need to invest in ourselves, invest in infrastructure, invest in human capital,</p>
<p>create greater equality of opportunity, but also to make sure that we have good governance</p>
<p>because governance is the variable that enables you to do all these other things.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve watched quite a bit, returning back to Putin, I&rsquo;ve watched quite a few interviews</p>
<p>with Putin and conversations, especially because I speak Russian fluently, I can understand</p>
<p>often the translations lose a lot.</p>
<p>I find the man putting morality aside very deep and interesting.</p>
<p>And I found almost no interview with him to get at that depth.</p>
<p>I was very hopeful for the Oliver Stone documentary and with him, and to me, because I deeply</p>
<p>respect Oliver Stone as a filmmaker in general, but it was a complete failure in my eyes,</p>
<p>that interview.</p>
<p>The lack of, I mean, I suppose you could toss it up to a language barrier, but a complete</p>
<p>lack of diving deep into the person is what I saw.</p>
<p>My question is a strange one, but if you were to sit down with Putin and have a conversation,</p>
<p>or perhaps if you were to sit down with Stalin and have a conversation, what kind of questions</p>
<p>would you ask?</p>
<p>This wouldn&rsquo;t be televised unless you want it to be.</p>
<p>So this is only you, so you&rsquo;re allowed to ask about some of the questions that are sort</p>
<p>of not socially acceptable, meaning putting morality aside, getting into depth of the</p>
<p>human character.</p>
<p>What would you ask?</p>
<p>So once again, they&rsquo;re very different personalities and very different time periods and very different</p>
<p>regimes.</p>
<p>So what I would talk to Stalin about and Putin about are not in the same category necessarily.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s take Putin.</p>
<p>So I would ask him where he thinks this is going, where he thinks Russia is going to</p>
<p>be in 25 years or 50 years.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the long term vision?</p>
<p>What does he anticipate the current trends are going to produce?</p>
<p>Is he under the illusion that Russia is on the upswing, that things are actually going</p>
<p>pretty well, that in 25 years Russia is going to still be a great power with a tremendous</p>
<p>dynamic economy and a lot of high tech and a lot of human capital and wonderful infrastructure</p>
<p>and a very high standard of living and a secure borders and sense of security at home.</p>
<p>Does he think the current path is leading in that direction and if not, if he understands</p>
<p>that the current trajectory does not provide for those kinds of circumstances, does it</p>
<p>bother him?</p>
<p>Does he worry about that?</p>
<p>Does he care about the future 25 or 50 years from now?</p>
<p>Deep down, what do you think his answer is?</p>
<p>The honest answer?</p>
<p>He thinks he&rsquo;s on that trajectory already or he doesn&rsquo;t care about that long term trajectory.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the mystery for me with him.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s clever.</p>
<p>He has tremendous sources of information.</p>
<p>He has great experience now as a world leader having served for effectively longer than</p>
<p>Leonid Brezhnev&rsquo;s long 18 year reign.</p>
<p>And so Putin has accumulated a great deal of experience at the highest level compared</p>
<p>to where he started.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;m interested to understand how he sees this long term evolution or non evolution</p>
<p>of Russia and whether he believes he&rsquo;s got them on the right trajectory or whether if</p>
<p>he doesn&rsquo;t believe that he cares.</p>
<p>I have no idea because I&rsquo;ve never spoken to him about this, but I would love to hear the</p>
<p>answer.</p>
<p>Sometimes you have to ask questions not directly like that, but you have to come a little bit</p>
<p>sideways.</p>
<p>You can elicit answers from people by making them feel comfortable and coming sideways</p>
<p>with them.</p>
<p>And just a quick question.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s talking about Russia, Putin&rsquo;s role in Russia.</p>
<p>Do you think it&rsquo;s interesting to ask, and you could say the same for Stalin, the more</p>
<p>personal question of how do you feel yourself about this whole thing?</p>
<p>About your life, about your legacy, looking at the person that&rsquo;s one of the most powerful</p>
<p>and important people in the history of civilization, both Putin and Stalin, you could argue.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Once you experience power at that level, it becomes something that&rsquo;s almost necessary</p>
<p>for you as a human being.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a drug.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an aphrodisiac.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a feeling.</p>
<p>You know, you go to the gym to exercise and the endorphins, the chemicals get released.</p>
<p>And even if you&rsquo;re tired or you&rsquo;re sore, you get this massive chemical change, which has</p>
<p>very dynamic effects on how you feel and the kind of level of energy you have for the rest</p>
<p>of the day.</p>
<p>And if you do that for a long time and then you don&rsquo;t do it for a while, you&rsquo;re like a</p>
<p>drug addict not getting your fix.</p>
<p>You miss it.</p>
<p>Your body misses that release of endorphins to a certain extent.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how power works for people like Putin.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how power works for people who run universities or are secretaries of state or</p>
<p>run corporations, fill in the blank.</p>
<p>In whatever ways power is exercised, it becomes almost a drug for people.</p>
<p>It becomes something that&rsquo;s difficult for them to give up.</p>
<p>It becomes a part of who they are.</p>
<p>It becomes necessary for their sense of self and well being.</p>
<p>The greatest people, the people I admire the most are the ones that can step away from</p>
<p>power, can give up the drug, can be satisfied, can be stronger even by walking away from</p>
<p>continued power when they had the option to continue.</p>
<p>So with a person like Putin, once again, I don&rsquo;t know him personally, so I have no basis</p>
<p>to judge this.</p>
<p>This is a general statement observable with many people and in historical terms.</p>
<p>With a person like Putin who&rsquo;s exercised this much power for this long, it&rsquo;s something that</p>
<p>becomes a part of who you are and you have a hard time imagining yourself without it.</p>
<p>You begin to conflate your personal power with the well being of the nation.</p>
<p>You begin to think that the more power you have, the better off the country is this conflation.</p>
<p>You begin to be able to not imagine, you can no longer imagine what it would be like just</p>
<p>to be an ordinary citizen or an ordinary person running a company even, something much smaller</p>
<p>than a country.</p>
<p>So I anticipate that without knowing for sure that he would be in that category of person,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;d want to explore that with questions with him about, so what&rsquo;s his day look like</p>
<p>from beginning to end?</p>
<p>Just take me through a typical day of yours.</p>
<p>What do you do on a day?</p>
<p>How does it start?</p>
<p>What are the ups?</p>
<p>What are the downs?</p>
<p>What are the parts of the day you look forward to the most?</p>
<p>What are the parts of the day you don&rsquo;t look forward to that much?</p>
<p>What do you consider a good day?</p>
<p>What do you consider a bad day?</p>
<p>How do you know that what you&rsquo;re doing is having the effects that you intend?</p>
<p>How do you follow up?</p>
<p>How do you gather the information, the reaction?</p>
<p>How do you get people to tell you to your face things that they know are uncomfortable</p>
<p>or that you might not want to hear?</p>
<p>Those kind of questions.</p>
<p>And through that window, through that kind of questioning, you get a window into a man</p>
<p>with power.</p>
<p>So let me ask about Stalin because you&rsquo;ve done more research, there&rsquo;s another amazing</p>
<p>interview you&rsquo;ve had, the introduction was that you know more about Stalin than Stalin</p>
<p>himself.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve done an incredible amount of research on Stalin.</p>
<p>So if you could talk to him, get sort of direct research, what question would you ask of Stalin?</p>
<p>I have so many questions, I don&rsquo;t even know where I would begin.</p>
<p>The thing about studying a person like Stalin, who&rsquo;s an immense creature, right?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s exercising the power of life and death over hundreds of millions of people.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s making decisions about novels and films and turbines and submarines and packs with</p>
<p>Hitler or deals with Churchill and Roosevelt and occupation of Mongolia or occupation of</p>
<p>North Korea.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s making phenomenally consequential decisions over all spheres of life, all areas of endeavor</p>
<p>and over much of the globe, much of the landmass of the earth.</p>
<p>And so what&rsquo;s that like?</p>
<p>Does he sometimes reflect on the amount of power and responsibility he has that he can</p>
<p>exercise?</p>
<p>Does he sometimes think about what it means that a single person has that kind of power?</p>
<p>And does it have an effect on his relations with others, his sense of self, the kinds</p>
<p>of things he values in life?</p>
<p>Does he sometimes think it&rsquo;s a mistake that he&rsquo;s accumulated this much power?</p>
<p>Does he sometimes wish he had a simpler life?</p>
<p>Or is he once again so drunk, so enamored, so caught up with chemically and spiritually</p>
<p>with exercising this kind of power that he couldn&rsquo;t live without it?</p>
<p>And then what were you thinking, I would ask him, in certain decisions that he made?</p>
<p>What were you thinking on certain dates and certain circumstances where you made a decision</p>
<p>and could have made a different decision?</p>
<p>Can you recall your thought processes?</p>
<p>Can you bring the decision back?</p>
<p>Was it seat of the pants?</p>
<p>Was it something you&rsquo;d been planning?</p>
<p>Did you just improvise or did you have a strategy?</p>
<p>What were you guided by?</p>
<p>Whose examples did you look to?</p>
<p>When you picked up these books that you read and you read the books and you made pencil</p>
<p>marks in them, is it because you absorbed the lesson there?</p>
<p>Or did it really not become a permanent lesson and it was just something that you checked</p>
<p>and it was like a reflex?</p>
<p>So I have many specific questions about many specific events and people and circumstances</p>
<p>that I have tried to figure out with the surviving source materials that we have in abundance.</p>
<p>But I would still like to delve into his mindset and reconstruct his mind.</p>
<p>The closer you get to Stalin, in some ways, the more elusive he can become.</p>
<p>And especially around World War II, you&rsquo;ve already illuminated a lot of interesting aspects</p>
<p>about Stalin&rsquo;s role in the war, but it would be interesting to ask even more questions</p>
<p>about how seat of the pants or deliberate some of the decisions have been.</p>
<p>If I could ask just one quick question, one last quick question, and you&rsquo;re constrained</p>
<p>in time and answering it, do you think there will always be evil in the world?</p>
<p>Do you think there will always be war?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, yes.</p>
<p>There are conflicting interests, conflicting goals that people have.</p>
<p>Most of the time, those conflicts can be resolved peacefully.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why we build strong institutions to resolve different interests and conflicts</p>
<p>peacefully.</p>
<p>But the fact, the enduring fact of conflicting interests and conflicting desires, that can</p>
<p>never be changed.</p>
<p>So the job that we have for humanity&rsquo;s sake is to make those conflicting interests, those</p>
<p>conflicting desires, to make them, to put them in a context where they can be resolved</p>
<p>peacefully, and not in a zero sum fashion.</p>
<p>So we can&rsquo;t get there on the global scale.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s always going to be the kind of conflict that sometimes gets violent.</p>
<p>What we don&rsquo;t want is a conflict among the strongest powers.</p>
<p>Great power conflict is unbelievably bad.</p>
<p>There are no words to describe it.</p>
<p>At least 55 million people died in World War II.</p>
<p>If we have a World War III, a war between the United States and China, or whatever it</p>
<p>might be, who knows what the number could be?</p>
<p>155 million, 255 million, 555 million, I don&rsquo;t even want to think about it.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s horrible when wars break out in the humanitarian catastrophes.</p>
<p>For example, Yemen and Syria and several other places I could name today.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just horrible what you see there.</p>
<p>And the scale is colossal for those places.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not planetary scale.</p>
<p>And so avoiding planetary scale destruction is really important for us.</p>
<p>And so having those different interests be somehow managed in a way that they don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>that no one sees advantage in a violent resolution.</p>
<p>And a part of that is remembering history, so they should read your books.</p>

<p>I consider it completely unimportant who in the party will vote or how, but what is extraordinarily</p>
