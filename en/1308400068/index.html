    <p>Hi, friends. This week we&rsquo;re talking about standards and how they keep you safe,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s not been one time in my entire life when I have dropped my standards or crossed</p>
<p>my own boundaries for something or someone and had a good experience. It&rsquo;s always bit me in the</p>
<p>ass. So I&rsquo;m going to teach you how your standards keep you safe and how to stop fucking up. But I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>not kidding. I&rsquo;ve literally regretted every single time I do not act in line with my standards that</p>
<p>I have for people or situations. Every single time. Like not once did it go good. And that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>because your standards keep you safe and protect you from experiences you&rsquo;re not supposed to have.</p>
<p>And your standards keep you safe and protect you from people who are not meant to have access to</p>
<p>you. And I&rsquo;ve had plenty of experience with it. So put your seatbelt on, bitch. We got a lot to</p>
<p>cover in this episode. But like I said, having standards and respecting them prevents you from</p>
<p>allowing people to have access to you that shouldn&rsquo;t be allowed to have access to you.</p>
<p>Because what happens in those situations when someone is in your life that does not meet your</p>
<p>standards, they&rsquo;re not going to know how to treat you. They&rsquo;re not going to know how to handle you.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not going to know how to be there for you. And that goes for situations too. Like there is</p>
<p>standards you can set all over the board across your life. You got relationships, friendships,</p>
<p>your job, basic things like being taken into consideration. That&rsquo;s a standard you should hold.</p>
<p>I 100% think that&rsquo;s the biggest one is requiring someone to take you into consideration no matter</p>
<p>what, even if they&rsquo;re upset, even if they&rsquo;re pissed off, my feelings still matter. I still</p>
<p>matter as a person. For you to get mad and throw me to the side, that&rsquo;s not going to fucking fly.</p>
<p>And if you can&rsquo;t do that, you&rsquo;re out. No ifs, ands, or buts. Because what happens when you allow</p>
<p>someone to discard you because they&rsquo;re emotional or they&rsquo;re dealing with shit? You&rsquo;re discarded.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no safety in that relationship. There&rsquo;s no safety in that experience. And there&rsquo;s no safety</p>
<p>with that person ever. So basically your standards set up an expectation for the experiences you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to have. And if you don&rsquo;t have good standards, your experiences are not going to be</p>
<p>good either. And one thing I want to say really quick about settling is when you settle for</p>
<p>something or you drop your standards or drop your boundaries for someone or something, that sends you</p>
<p>a silent message. And it&rsquo;s not a good one. When you do not respect the standards you&rsquo;ve set for</p>
<p>yourself and you accept something beneath what you think you&rsquo;re worth, that sends you a silent</p>
<p>message of that is what you&rsquo;re worth. You&rsquo;re not that valuable. So your sense of feeling valuable</p>
<p>and your confidence and everything about you and especially the experiences you have are going to</p>
<p>come from if you act in line with your standards or not. Stop fucking dropping them. I love you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to be rough with you because I love you. So with setting standards, it&rsquo;s really just about</p>
<p>wanting better for yourself and caring that you&rsquo;re upset by something. And caring that something</p>
<p>could potentially upset you. Like if you&rsquo;re hurt, that matters. And that will make you aware of the</p>
<p>new standards you want to set. So a lot of people learn through contrast. And that&rsquo;s kind of like</p>
<p>how the universe is going to throw shit at you. You&rsquo;re going to learn a lot about what you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>want because it makes you aware of what you do want. And if you have an experience that&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>shit and you feel like you&rsquo;ve been mistreated, you now know a standard to set for how you want to be</p>
<p>treated. And then when you act in line with that, you get treated good. But if you keep settling for</p>
<p>these Joe Schmoes that treat you like shit, you&rsquo;re always going to have shit. No way around it.</p>
<p>I do talk a lot about safety. So with standards, if someone hurts you, setting standards will</p>
<p>prevent you from being hurt in that way. Again, this is in your control. Setting your standards</p>
<p>is the only control you have over limiting the amount that you&rsquo;re hurt. So when people hurt you,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t control it. When people do things that upset you or bother you, there is no control over</p>
<p>other people&rsquo;s actions, but there is control over what you will allow and what you choose to allow</p>
<p>in dictates the experience you&rsquo;re going to have. Like I&rsquo;ve kind of like worded this the same</p>
<p>five different ways, but you need to fucking hear it. Like I need to make sure it hits because this</p>
<p>is so important. Like standards are your only safety. So if you have an experience that you</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t like or someone hurts you or does something to you and treats you a way that you don&rsquo;t want to</p>
<p>be treated, they&rsquo;re basically showing you who they are and you need to act accordingly. You need to</p>
<p>take into consideration what the fuck has just happened and ask yourself, do I want this person</p>
<p>in my life? And if it&rsquo;s an experience and not a person, do I want this experience again? Because</p>
<p>if you are aware you don&rsquo;t like something and you do nothing to change it, the second time it happens</p>
<p>to you is your fucking fault. It&rsquo;s your fucking fault. Y&rsquo;all want to play the blame game? Y&rsquo;all</p>
<p>want to play the whole victim mentality? Nuh-uh. The first time it happens and you&rsquo;re hurt or upset</p>
<p>and you do nothing. The second time it&rsquo;s on you and every time after that. And this applies to</p>
<p>anyone. Literally I&rsquo;ve cut off my own parents, friends, siblings. I&rsquo;ve cut off everyone in my</p>
<p>life for shit like this. I&rsquo;m close with most everybody now and like we&rsquo;ve repaired things,</p>
<p>but no one gets a free fucking pass. No one. When it comes to you protecting yourself and showing</p>
<p>yourself your value, everyone can come correct or get fucked. Like literally kick rocks. I don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>care what someone&rsquo;s attachment is to you. Oh I&rsquo;m your dad. I&rsquo;m your cousin. I&rsquo;m your best friend.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m your sibling. So? That doesn&rsquo;t give you a free pass to disrespect me or to treat me like shit.</p>
<p>And especially if they&rsquo;re your boss. Oh my god. Because when there&rsquo;s a power dynamic like that</p>
<p>or someone&rsquo;s supplying you money or like you have to report to them in a job,</p>
<p>they feel like they get this power trip and they can get away with shit. Nuh-uh. Nothing slides.</p>
<p>Nothing slides. I don&rsquo;t care who it is or what it is. It&rsquo;s gonna cause a lot of chaos in your life</p>
<p>if you have not set standards before. Because people that are in your life right now have</p>
<p>benefited from not having to act a certain way around you. So if you&rsquo;ve just let everything go,</p>
<p>when all of a sudden you stand up and you&rsquo;re like no these are the new standards for how I will</p>
<p>accept being treated, they&rsquo;re all of a sudden gonna have to change their behavior. You&rsquo;re gonna get a</p>
<p>lot of pushback and you&rsquo;re gonna get a lot of shit and you&rsquo;re gonna feel like you lose a lot</p>
<p>of people and everything is just bad. Like why did I even set these standards? But it&rsquo;s gonna weed</p>
<p>out the people who will treat you good enough for you to keep them in your life. And when you start</p>
<p>setting standards and you match them and you live by them, you&rsquo;re gonna be a match to people who</p>
<p>will meet them and have no problem with treating you the way that you want to be treated. You just</p>
<p>have to weed out the bad shit and show how serious you are first. Like you have to fully disconnect</p>
<p>from the person you used to be. And when you set these new standards and stand in them and everyone</p>
<p>can bend to you now, there&rsquo;s people and energy is always flowing at you. So you&rsquo;re always gonna be</p>
<p>meeting new people, interacting with new people. New people are gonna come in and out of your life.</p>
<p>A lot are gonna come out but the ones that come in and replace them with these new standards you</p>
<p>have, you&rsquo;re gonna be the closest with people you&rsquo;ve ever been. You&rsquo;re gonna feel valued beyond</p>
<p>comprehension because these people are basically showing you and sending you the message you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>worth treating like this because you set that standard. And for the people who have trouble</p>
<p>setting standards and boundaries, I have a really big analogy and it blew the fuck up when I shared</p>
<p>it on TikTok about setting a standard or setting a boundary or setting anything for what it takes</p>
<p>to access you. It&rsquo;s like if you go to a club like you&rsquo;re going to a little nightclub and a bouncer</p>
<p>at the door tells you it&rsquo;s ten dollars to get in. What do you do? You pay the ten dollars or you get</p>
<p>fucked. Like they&rsquo;re not letting you in. They don&rsquo;t care who you are. Their cover is ten dollars and you</p>
<p>pay it or you don&rsquo;t get in. You need to become that way with what it takes to access you. There is no</p>
<p>ifs, ands, or buts. You pay the entry. Basically people need to act correct and like treat you a</p>
<p>certain way or they&rsquo;re not getting past the fucking door because if you let someone in a club who</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t pay the dues to get in there, they&rsquo;re not going to be as invested. They&rsquo;re not going to be</p>
<p>like okay I should behave. If you just let a bunch of hooligans in who didn&rsquo;t do what it takes to</p>
<p>access the club, they&rsquo;re going to go in there and run fucking wild and not know how to treat it.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not going to give a fuck, but when you set value on something and make people match it and</p>
<p>pay it, it makes them act different and it makes them respect you and respect the place that they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going into. And I know I&rsquo;m using the analogy of the club, but this all relates to your personal</p>
<p>relationships and your relationship with yourself. So like when the bouncer at the door is like it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>10 bucks, it&rsquo;s not offensive if people can&rsquo;t afford it. You&rsquo;re just not of caliber to get in.</p>
<p>If you can&rsquo;t afford 10 bucks to get into a club, you shouldn&rsquo;t fucking be going to the club anyway.</p>
<p>But setting standards is not an attack on people. People are gonna feel like it&rsquo;s an attack. Some</p>
<p>people are gonna walk up to the club and say oh it&rsquo;s 10 bucks to get in here. Ew fuck no it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>worth that. Does the bouncer give a fuck? Does the bouncer all of a sudden get insecure and be like</p>
<p>oh my god no you can just come in you can just come in. No the price is set. If you don&rsquo;t see</p>
<p>the value in it, you don&rsquo;t see it. That&rsquo;s not what&rsquo;s in question. So if you tell someone this</p>
<p>is how you need to behave to access me and to come and be a part of my life, some people are</p>
<p>going to have pushback. Some people are not going to see its value. Some people are not going to see</p>
<p>its worth. But the people who do see it will happily fucking pay it. When you see the value</p>
<p>on the other side, they have no problem doing what it takes to get there. So the day someone sees the</p>
<p>true value in you, they&rsquo;ll meet any standard you have and they&rsquo;ll respect your boundaries because</p>
<p>they see the value in you and they want to be with you or be close to you or be in your life.</p>
<p>They want to have you in their life. And I just want to say I&rsquo;m sorry to anyone who has not had</p>
<p>someone in their life yet basically say you&rsquo;re worth setting a standard or a boundary. Like if</p>
<p>people just have treated you like shit your whole life, hi we were late, hey bestie boo. But you</p>
<p>gotta get like cutthroat with this shit. You have to like really protect yourself because when you</p>
<p>keep allowing people to get access to you who are not willing to do basic shit like care about the</p>
<p>way that you fucking feel, text you back, be considerate, you&rsquo;re only going to have experiences</p>
<p>with people who do not know how to treat you and will further the cycle of you feeling like shit</p>
<p>about yourself and just in general. So that was a little tidbit for people who have discomfort and</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t feel confident to express boundaries. They&rsquo;re not going to hurt someone. People are</p>
<p>going to get offended sure but who gives a fuck. They&rsquo;re not meant to be there. If anyone is</p>
<p>offended by what you require to access you, they shouldn&rsquo;t have access to you. But my next point</p>
<p>is when you truly see your worth and you truly see the value you have to offer and you can see how</p>
<p>your presence in someone&rsquo;s life is something special, it&rsquo;s going to become very difficult and</p>
<p>very uncomfortable to give someone access to you that you have to drop your boundaries and drop</p>
<p>your standards for because it doesn&rsquo;t feel good to feel like you&rsquo;re giving someone something</p>
<p>valuable that isn&rsquo;t worth shit. It&rsquo;s like giving someone yourself at a discount. That doesn&rsquo;t feel</p>
<p>good. So if you struggle with setting standards and boundaries, your number one thing that will</p>
<p>kick you in the ass to start doing it is start seeing your own value. And I have two ways that</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had to do this and the only ways I could find out to finally like feel valuable and the first</p>
<p>is go on a fucking scavenger hunt by asking yourself if you met someone who is a literal</p>
<p>clone of you, what about them would you be like, fuck, finally I met a friend like them or finally</p>
<p>I met a partner like this. Make a list and write down all of the traits that you would finally</p>
<p>be so happy you found and all the traits that you could appreciate about having this person in your</p>
<p>life. How would just their presence make your life better? How would you feel about yourself? How</p>
<p>would you feel about life? How would you feel just having this person around you? And then when this</p>
<p>person cares about you the way that they love your clone, the way that they care for you, how does</p>
<p>that make you feel? And when you get to experience yourself firsthand like that, your value is not</p>
<p>going to be something you can ignore anymore. I don&rsquo;t care what you&rsquo;ve been through. You&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>going to be able to downplay yourself anymore. You&rsquo;re going to be like, shit, I am a little gift.</p>
<p>And the second way I started recognizing my own value and seeing it is experiencing myself through</p>
<p>other people. So there&rsquo;s certain things that I do for people that I didn&rsquo;t realize made them feel</p>
<p>so good. So I have a couple of examples. One is like one of my friends the other day, like I</p>
<p>sneezed and I like spit when I sneezed and it got on my arm and she like discreetly, like privately,</p>
<p>like got my attention to it and like got me to wipe it off without everyone else noticing.</p>
<p>Like I have some fucking spit on my arm. Like it&rsquo;s a normal fucking human thing to sneeze,</p>
<p>but like she made sure I wasn&rsquo;t embarrassed and like took care of it in private to protect me.</p>
<p>And the same thing goes when someone will like look at me and like do this to like let me know</p>
<p>I have something in my teeth to protect me and make sure I don&rsquo;t look stupid. Like that makes me</p>
<p>feel so cared for and looked after that like you&rsquo;re protective of me. You want to make sure I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>not embarrassed and you&rsquo;re always looking out for me. And then I realized Leo, you do that for other</p>
<p>people too. So I knew how my friend made me feel and how safe and like cared about I felt just from</p>
<p>these little acts. And I had to remind myself, Leo, you do that for other people. You make other</p>
<p>people feel that level of safe and protected with you. And when you truly feel how you impact others</p>
<p>and what your presence is like in their life and the little shit that you do that&rsquo;s so important,</p>
<p>when you can physically feel yourself, again, your value is undeniable. And I have a full</p>
<p>podcast episode about this dynamic. It&rsquo;s episode 15 of my podcast. It&rsquo;s on Apple Podcasts and</p>
<p>Spotify. I&rsquo;ll put the link in the description. So if you want to hear more about that topic and more</p>
<p>details and things like that, it&rsquo;s there. The title is how to actually feel lovable. So I break all</p>
<p>that down there if you want to listen to it. So the next thing I want to talk about is feeling</p>
<p>more confident setting your boundaries. So a lot of people make a list of like all the things that</p>
<p>they want out of a partner or a friend or like their job and they do not feel confident or good</p>
<p>enough to ask for those things. So one conversation I had the other day with one of my clients is I</p>
<p>made her make a list of all like the ideal traits of the guy that she wants to date because she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>looking for a relationship. So we made the list and then I said, okay, out of all the things that</p>
<p>you just wrote about this guy, if this guy was standing in front of you, would you feel confident</p>
<p>to be with him? Would you feel confident to go for him? And she almost started crying and said no.</p>
<p>So I said, okay, after you see this list of everything you want to ask for from a partner,</p>
<p>what would you need to do or change to feel like you deserve that? How would you need to behave?</p>
<p>How would you need to transform? What would you need to do differently with yourself, with your</p>
<p>behavior, with everything? And this reveals all the things you need to do to finally feel confident</p>
<p>to ask for the standards you want to set because it&rsquo;s nice and logical to be like, oh, I want to</p>
<p>ask for all these things. But if you don&rsquo;t feel worth asking for it, you&rsquo;re not going to feel</p>
<p>comfortable doing it. And you&rsquo;re going to get into situations where you convince yourself, oh,</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s fine. He&rsquo;s got a couple of these things, but like you&rsquo;re secretly insecure.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re not going to hold that standard so fucking hard because you don&rsquo;t feel worth it.</p>
<p>But when you get clear on everything you want to ask for, when you see that you can offer it,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to have absolutely no problem asking for it. It&rsquo;s just going to be like a no-brainer.</p>
<p>Like if you don&rsquo;t have all these things that I&rsquo;m asking for, get away from me. And that&rsquo;s one reason</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so damn cocky with how picky I am with relationships because I do not ask for anything</p>
<p>I cannot offer. I can offer a fucking lot. So what the fuck do I look like going and dating</p>
<p>somebody who can&rsquo;t offer me the same? That&rsquo;s degrading to myself. If you want to talk like</p>
<p>real life, if you want to be real, I know that&rsquo;s kind of like sad and people don&rsquo;t like to face</p>
<p>that reality, but it&rsquo;s the goddamn truth. When you can offer everything you ask for,</p>
<p>no one is allowed to shame you for asking for it. Sometimes people are like, oh my god, Leo,</p>
<p>your standards are really high. Do you think you&rsquo;ll find that person? And I have no problem</p>
<p>saying I don&rsquo;t know. I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;ll find the person that&rsquo;s a match to me and can match</p>
<p>my standards, but I&rsquo;m not dropping them for anyone. I&rsquo;ll be alone before I devalue myself</p>
<p>by settling and getting with someone who can&rsquo;t offer what the fuck I offer. That&rsquo;s not fair.</p>
<p>I will never do that to myself. I promised myself I never would, and I fucking won&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>When you look at it like a transaction like that, it makes sense. I feel confident asking for this</p>
<p>shit. Why should I settle? Why should I? In what world, bitch? And I don&rsquo;t care if people think</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m an asshole. Plenty of people try to date me. People are constantly in my fucking DMs. When</p>
<p>I go out, people are constantly trying to flirt with me and do shit. I used to never get hit on,</p>
<p>but now all of a sudden, everybody wants to hit on me, and when I&rsquo;m not impressed,</p>
<p>some people get upset. I&rsquo;m polite and I&rsquo;m respectful, but I set my walls up. As soon as</p>
<p>you take it too fucking flirty and I&rsquo;m not interested in you, let&rsquo;s shut that shit down</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s not do that. Let&rsquo;s not go there. So I have absolutely no insecurity about demanding</p>
<p>certain standards and certain things from people, whether it&rsquo;s a friend,</p>
<p>a relationship, a job, a boss, a manager, anything. I know what I can offer. I feel the value and I</p>
<p>know what the fuck I&rsquo;m capable of and how I care about people, and when you get very clear on that,</p>
<p>you have no insecurity. You will never not feel valuable when you see it in your goddamn self.</p>
<p>And I also have a full podcast episode about feeling valuable. It&rsquo;s episode 11. It&rsquo;s also</p>
<p>on Spotify and Apple Podcasts. All my video podcasts are only episode 40 and up, but episode</p>
<p>1 through 40 is on the audio version. I will also link that one in the description, but if you</p>
<p>struggle with feeling valuable and you need help seeing your own value, I&rsquo;ve got you. But I do have</p>
<p>a random little piece of insight that I want to share, and it&rsquo;s my favorite analogy for everything.</p>
<p>My favorite! And the analogy is giving a crackhead a Birkin. A Birkin is a $10,000 purse. It&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>most expensive handbag in the world, one of them, but like they range, they start at like 10 grand</p>
<p>and they go up to like $300,000. Yeah, for a purse. I know. I don&rsquo;t make them. Don&rsquo;t attack me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just using this as the example. So it&rsquo;s like you have this very valuable thing and you give it</p>
<p>to someone who does not know how to appreciate it and does not see the value in it. You think if you</p>
<p>give a Birkin to a crackhead, they&rsquo;re not just going to throw it the fuck around and beat it up</p>
<p>and not know how to treat it because they are not able, they don&rsquo;t have the capacity to appreciate</p>
<p>or even the knowledge to understand the value of that item. So I look at it like I&rsquo;m a fucking</p>
<p>Birkin who my whole life has been given to a bunch of crackheads because people have never known how</p>
<p>to treat me. I&rsquo;ve always felt like I wasn&rsquo;t valued or appreciated until I started setting these</p>
<p>standards and then I matched up with people who value me beyond like ways I&rsquo;ve ever felt. But it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>very unfair and it&rsquo;s kind of stupid on your end to give yourself a Birkin to a crackhead and then</p>
<p>get mad at the crackhead for them mistreating you and just throwing you around. If you see someone</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t appreciate you, don&rsquo;t fucking give them access to you because who&rsquo;s going to get hurt?</p>
<p>You. You bitch. Me. We. Always. But in the same sense, if you give a Birkin to someone who knows</p>
<p>the value in it, they&rsquo;re going to cherish the fuck out of it. They&rsquo;re going to take care of</p>
<p>it like nobody&rsquo;s business. They&rsquo;re going to literally value that item and be so delicate</p>
<p>and careful with it and they&rsquo;re going to make sure they do nothing to risk it. A crackhead is just</p>
<p>going to toss you the fuck around. And one level deeper with that, if someone is not used to having</p>
<p>valuable things, they have a certain way of treating shit. So when they get something valuable,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re just going to treat it how they are used to treating things. They don&rsquo;t understand value.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t know how to treat anything different. If they&rsquo;ve only had low value shit before, they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to wreck anything valuable they get because they don&rsquo;t know how to treat it. Their standard</p>
<p>for how you behave and how you treat things is set low. When you give them something high,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re not going to know what to do with it. They&rsquo;re going to treat it how they&rsquo;ve always</p>
<p>treated it and not think that they&rsquo;re devaluing or abusing it. So if you meet someone who&rsquo;s only</p>
<p>used to having mediocre ass people and you&rsquo;re someone special and you get together, they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to treat you like you&rsquo;re mediocre as fuck. And that is something that made me question my</p>
<p>value so many times. I was with people who have only been with average normal people. I&rsquo;m a very</p>
<p>fucking special person in so many ways. And these people would treat me like I was average because</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s all they were used to. They didn&rsquo;t understand what the fuck to do different.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t even know how to see it. They just felt like I was special, but they didn&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>what the fuck to do about it. And being treated poorly by people who weren&rsquo;t shit made me question</p>
<p>my own value. But if you are in the hands of a crackhead or someone that is used to having like</p>
<p>average shit and you&rsquo;re something special, do not ever question if you are special. You fucking are.</p>
<p>You feel it. You know it. Get the fuck out of their hands. Get into someone&rsquo;s hands who knows</p>
<p>how to treat something valuable and knows how to treat something special. That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s going to</p>
<p>make you feel special. So that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m saying with the standards. This is fully in your control.</p>
<p>Stop giving yourself to crackheads. You&rsquo;re a Birkin. Now I&rsquo;m going to hit this from a little</p>
<p>bit of a spiritual angle and vibrationally and universally and all that. So if you&rsquo;re into</p>
<p>manifestation, say no to anything that doesn&rsquo;t meet your standards. Set standards with what the</p>
<p>universe brings into your life and makes you a match to. But the whole thing with being a match,</p>
<p>like I said, you need to get clear on what you want and what you need to do to change to become</p>
<p>confident and asking for it and be like, yeah, I fucking deserve that shit. I demand it.</p>
<p>Like you need to make enough changes and rise to become a match to the thing that you want.</p>
<p>And you have to have the level of confidence where you&rsquo;re like, yeah, that&rsquo;s mine. I have no qualms</p>
<p>about asking for what I&rsquo;m asking for. I fucking deserve it because I am XYZ. When you make yourself</p>
<p>a match to it, the universe will have no problem giving it to you. But when you have insecurity</p>
<p>about it, you ain&rsquo;t getting a bitch. But with the manifestation thing, say no to everything that</p>
<p>comes up that does not meet your standards. Every single thing that comes up, a person,</p>
<p>an opportunity, anything. If it does not meet the standards that you have, say no. Give the universe</p>
<p>or God or whoever you believe in. The only option is to bring in what the fuck I&rsquo;m asking for. I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>not accepting shit else. Stop accepting things beneath your standards or that&rsquo;s all you&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>get. And one thing I like to do when I get something or an opportunity that is lined up</p>
<p>when I&rsquo;m asking for something and it&rsquo;s not quite my standards, I use it as a tool to like strengthen</p>
<p>my standards. I&rsquo;m like, okay, what is this person or this thing making me aware of that I do actually</p>
<p>want? What is it making me aware of that I don&rsquo;t want? Because anything you don&rsquo;t want, you can</p>
<p>just flip it and now it&rsquo;s what you do want. So if you don&rsquo;t want someone short, I want someone tall.</p>
<p>It makes you aware of what your standards should be. And I had an experience recently that I talked</p>
<p>about in episode 66 where I wasn&rsquo;t sure if I was dead set on a certain standard and being presented</p>
<p>the opportunity and paying attention to the way that I felt when I got it, I wasn&rsquo;t fully satisfied.</p>
<p>So instead of talking myself into being happy with what I did like about it, it wasn&rsquo;t fully</p>
<p>what I wanted. And what that did was give me solid fucking confidence that, no, this is a full</p>
<p>standard I want to set and I&rsquo;m not fucking budging on it. It&rsquo;s not something that&rsquo;s negotiable. So</p>
<p>when the universe is throwing you shit, don&rsquo;t think that you&rsquo;re only worth that or better is</p>
<p>not going to come. You&rsquo;re being tested and prepared and being made certain of what you do want. And</p>
<p>the last thing with that is when you let someone in your life that is beneath your standards,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re taking the place of someone to come in who does meet your standards. Get them the fuck</p>
<p>out. Stop being scared of being alone. You will be just fine. When you spend time alone, you</p>
<p>recognize your own value. So stop letting people who are not up to your standards take the space</p>
<p>of someone who would be. You have to keep that space open or you&rsquo;re not a match to it. Why the</p>
<p>fuck would they just come in like you&rsquo;re not going to get the universe like throwing you a thousand</p>
<p>fucking people and you just like have to wait with the one that you&rsquo;re not happy with until the next</p>
<p>one comes along, then you can jump to it. You just got to jump for the shit. Jump off the fucking</p>
<p>ledge as soon as you realize where you&rsquo;re at is not what you want. Jump and watch what catches you.</p>
<p>It is very scary. It&rsquo;s fucking terrifying, but settling devalues yourself. So you really have</p>
<p>no option. It&rsquo;s your relationship with yourself and telling yourself, I actually am worth this</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m going to settle for this or jump. And every single time I have jumped, something better has</p>
<p>caught me. So my last little tidbit I&rsquo;m going to throw in this episode is actually something I</p>
<p>talked to a friend about last night. And it&rsquo;s about loving someone too much. And he was talking about</p>
<p>how he just loves people so much and he keeps getting hurt. And I had to explain to him the</p>
<p>same thing that I&rsquo;ve had to realize in myself. When you are capable of loving someone to like a</p>
<p>high magnitude and you really care for people, it&rsquo;s a fucking burden that you&rsquo;re going to have</p>
<p>to learn to live with. Loving too strongly and being too good of a person is a fucking burden</p>
<p>because you cannot give that love to everyone. When you give love that is special, like I said,</p>
<p>to someone who can&rsquo;t appreciate it or isn&rsquo;t worth it, who gets hurt? You. The burden of</p>
<p>loving too deeply is just one you have to live with. You have to become very selective with who</p>
<p>you allow access to that love. You have to make sure this person is safe for you to give this</p>
<p>love to because you&rsquo;re giving them a part of you. If you give someone a part of you that is deep and</p>
<p>very valuable, you have to make sure those are safe hands for you to lay that into. Because when</p>
<p>you lay that type of love onto someone who can&rsquo;t accept it or isn&rsquo;t worth it, like I said, you get</p>
<p>hurt. So back to my main point of this video. Your only control with if you get hurt or not</p>
<p>is your standards. Stop settling. All right, I think I&rsquo;m done yelling at you. I hope this</p>
<p>episode was helpful. If this episode did help you, don&rsquo;t be afraid to share it with a friend</p>
<p>or share it with some people that you care about because this is like the most loving shit you</p>
<p>could do. And leave me a comment on this video and let me know what you thought of it because</p>
<p>I love hearing what you guys have to say. And if you&rsquo;re listening to the audio version of this</p>
<p>podcast, leave me a five stars rating. Thanks, that helps a lot. Other than that, all of my</p>
<p>social media is in the description if you want to follow it. And everything else you need from</p>
<p>me too. My merch, my everything in the description. Check it out. But thank you guys so much for</p>
<p>watching. Everybody be safe and take care of yourself. Stop fucking settling. Hold your</p>
<p>standards. Love you. I&rsquo;ll talk to you guys next Sunday.</p>
