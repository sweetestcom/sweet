I want to talk about ketosis and constipation now I wish it was real cut-and-dry that it would always be this one thing but it&amp;rsquo;s it&amp;rsquo;s usually a complex thing that could involve multiple things so I&amp;rsquo;m just going to go through some of the scenarios that that come up most people think it&amp;rsquo;s a lack of fiber that causes constipation that is absolutely not true in fact a lot of the fiber that people consume even from vegetables it&amp;rsquo;s insoluble which means it&amp;rsquo;s not digesting so adding more will actually constipate you more so if you look at what you did before starting this plan and after we want to look at the big changes and we want to evaluate each change and I&amp;rsquo;m not talking about constipation you had before doing ketosis that&amp;rsquo;s a whole different situation which involves probiotics and a bunch of other stuff I&amp;rsquo;m talking about after the ketogenic diet you started getting constipation what do you do what do you look at so we&amp;rsquo;re going to look at the change in vegetable fibers okay the microbes live on fiber they will get overwhelmed easily if you have not adapted these microbes to this new way of eating so just like keto adaptation you have to look at the adaptation of the microbes that have to evolve and grow to digest all these fibers because if they can&amp;rsquo;t digest the fibers you&amp;rsquo;re going to have this all this cruciferous or kale shaking you&amp;rsquo;re going to bloat you&amp;rsquo;re going to get gas if that&amp;rsquo;s happening then you&amp;rsquo;re going to have to change the vegetables that&amp;rsquo;s simple too maybe something like like just lettuce spinach other types of vegetables romaine lettuce something like that to get your greens so just definitely look at that other people have an issue with certain types of cruciferous like myself I can&amp;rsquo;t eat broccoli it tears me up it will constipate me I can do lots of cabbage other people cannot do cabbage they can do broccoli so you&amp;rsquo;re going to test it out I also recommend fermented vegetables simply because those are much easier to break down and pickles are good sauerkraut kimchi very very good okay so we have that and then we also have you know just the fat that you&amp;rsquo;re eating the protein in most cases those two types of macros are easier to digest then the vegetable carbohydrates believe it or not but it could be that you&amp;rsquo;re doing too much fat that&amp;rsquo;s plugging up the gallbladder and that is backing you up so if we look at just the whole digestive system you have the ability to digest fat proteins carbohydrates or or even fiber and just you want to just check each one of those so so things to adjust our the vegetable the type of vegetable may be too much fat and the other thing is that when you start a ketogenic diet you will sometimes lose a lot of water weight in the process lose a lot of electrolytes so that&amp;rsquo;s why I always like to add that back in there I highly recommend the electrolyte powder that I use because it has a thousand milligrams of potassium it has magnesium and as all the electrolytes and trace minerals no sugar that usually will help the elimination greatly so even potassium in general is the electrolyte to help with muscle cramps and colon cramping or stagnant colon so when you have more potassium and helps facilitate elimination as well as magnesium those two are electrolytes that are really important elimination on a very rare occasion I may have the person make more water but typically that&amp;rsquo;s very rare that&amp;rsquo;s not usually the cause but it&amp;rsquo;s something to look at if you&amp;rsquo;re eating drinking no water you know that could be a situation but it&amp;rsquo;s rare the other thing is that if you&amp;rsquo;re doing too many nuts or even some seeds which it&amp;rsquo;s usually nuts or peanut butter typically if you&amp;rsquo;re doing raw nuts you&amp;rsquo;re doing you&amp;rsquo;re getting enzyme inhibitors which means that that&amp;rsquo;s going to stop your digestion right there that could be causing the constipation so an experiment would be to germinate the nuts soak them overnight draw them out in the oven on to lower temperatures and then consume them and you may find that that&amp;rsquo;s also a problem the other thing is just to cut out the nuts for a couple days and see if that gets rid of the constipation because that could block and it also has insoluble fibers so you&amp;rsquo;ve got the combination of enzyme inhibitors and then you just can&amp;rsquo;t digest the nuts the enzyme inhibitors and then as far as dairy goes so quite a few people are have allergies to milk sugar lactose okay so that&amp;rsquo;s the situation and you&amp;rsquo;re bloating or you&amp;rsquo;re not digesting this cheese that you&amp;rsquo;re consuming we got to look at that as well so just kind of experiment if you have some dairy and you get gas or bloating then we need to eliminate that at this time there are types of dairy that are low in lactose for example lactose free cheese lactose usually cheese has very low amounts of lactose because the microbes consume that sugar and then they they basically you get more of a protein than you would get if you had actual milk or yogurt casein is the protein in dairy which that&amp;rsquo;s really high in hard cheeses and it&amp;rsquo;s also lower in soft cheeses it&amp;rsquo;s higher in Greek yogurt so you know if you&amp;rsquo;re consuming too much of that protein that could back people up as well back you up so you might want to try try goat&amp;rsquo;s cheese or sheep cheese which people can digest that much better than actually cheese from cows so you might want to try that as well so these are just things to look at in your search to find a solution for constipation put your comments below hi guys hey listen I created a pretty amazing evaluation quiz down below that actually analyzes your symptoms to find the cause the root cause of all of your symptoms the most likely cause so take the quiz now

ketosis and constipation now I wish it was  </p><p>real cut-and-dry that it would always be this one 
thing but it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s usually a complex thing that  </p><p>could involve multiple things so I&rsquo;m just going 
to go through some of the scenarios that that  </p><p>come up most people think it&rsquo;s a lack of fiber 
that causes constipation that is absolutely not  </p><p>true in fact a lot of the fiber that people 
consume even from vegetables it&rsquo;s insoluble  </p><p>which means it&rsquo;s not digesting so adding more 
will actually constipate you more so if you look  </p><p>at what you did before starting this plan and 
after we want to look at the big changes and we  </p><p>want to evaluate each change and I&rsquo;m not talking 
about constipation you had before doing ketosis  </p><p>that&rsquo;s a whole different situation which involves 
probiotics and a bunch of other stuff I&rsquo;m talking  </p><p>about after the ketogenic diet you started getting 
constipation what do you do what do you look at so  </p><p>we&rsquo;re going to look at the change in vegetable 
fibers okay the microbes live on fiber they will  </p><p>get overwhelmed easily if you have not adapted 
these microbes to this new way of eating so just  </p><p>like keto adaptation you have to look at the 
adaptation of the microbes that have to evolve  </p><p>and grow to digest all these fibers because if 
they can&rsquo;t digest the fibers you&rsquo;re going to have  </p><p>this all this cruciferous or kale shaking you&rsquo;re 
going to bloat you&rsquo;re going to get gas if that&rsquo;s  </p><p>happening then you&rsquo;re going to have to change 
the vegetables that&rsquo;s simple too maybe something  </p><p>like like just lettuce spinach other types of 
vegetables romaine lettuce something like that  </p><p>to get your greens so just definitely look at that 
other people have an issue with certain types of  </p><p>cruciferous like myself I can&rsquo;t eat broccoli it 
tears me up it will constipate me I can do lots  </p><p>of cabbage other people cannot do cabbage they can 
do broccoli so you&rsquo;re going to test it out I also  </p><p>recommend fermented vegetables simply because 
those are much easier to break down and pickles  </p><p>are good sauerkraut kimchi very very good okay so 
we have that and then we also have you know just  </p><p>the fat that you&rsquo;re eating the protein in most 
cases those two types of macros are easier to  </p><p>digest then the vegetable carbohydrates believe it 
or not but it could be that you&rsquo;re doing too much  </p><p>fat that&rsquo;s plugging up the gallbladder and that 
is backing you up so if we look at just the whole  </p><p>digestive system you have the ability to digest 
fat proteins carbohydrates or or even fiber and  </p><p>just you want to just check each one of those so 
so things to adjust our the vegetable the type  </p><p>of vegetable may be too much fat and the other 
thing is that when you start a ketogenic diet  </p><p>you will sometimes lose a lot of water weight in 
the process lose a lot of electrolytes so that&rsquo;s  </p><p>why I always like to add that back in there I 
highly recommend the electrolyte powder that I use  </p><p>because it has a thousand milligrams of potassium 
it has magnesium and as all the electrolytes and  </p><p>trace minerals no sugar that usually will help the 
elimination greatly so even potassium in general  </p><p>is the electrolyte to help with muscle cramps and 
colon cramping or stagnant colon so when you have  </p><p>more potassium and helps facilitate elimination as 
well as magnesium those two are electrolytes that  </p><p>are really important elimination on a very rare 
occasion I may have the person make more water  </p><p>but typically that&rsquo;s very rare that&rsquo;s not usually 
the cause but it&rsquo;s something to look at if you&rsquo;re  </p><p>eating drinking no water you know that could be 
a situation but it&rsquo;s rare the other thing is that  </p><p>if you&rsquo;re doing too many nuts or even some seeds 
which it&rsquo;s usually nuts or peanut butter typically  </p><p>if you&rsquo;re doing raw nuts you&rsquo;re doing you&rsquo;re 
getting enzyme inhibitors which means that that&rsquo;s  </p><p>going to stop your digestion right there that 
could be causing the constipation so an experiment  </p><p>would be to germinate the nuts soak them overnight 
draw them out in the oven on to lower temperatures  </p><p>and then consume them and you may find that that&rsquo;s 
also a problem the other thing is just to cut out  </p><p>the nuts for a couple days and see if that gets 
rid of the constipation because that could block  </p><p>and it also has insoluble fibers so you&rsquo;ve got the 
combination of enzyme inhibitors and then you just  </p><p>can&rsquo;t digest the nuts the enzyme inhibitors and 
then as far as dairy goes so quite a few people  </p><p>are have allergies to milk sugar lactose okay so 
that&rsquo;s the situation and you&rsquo;re bloating or you&rsquo;re  </p><p>not digesting this cheese that you&rsquo;re consuming 
we got to look at that as well so just kind of  </p><p>experiment if you have some dairy and you get 
gas or bloating then we need to eliminate that  </p><p>at this time there are types of dairy that are low 
in lactose for example lactose free cheese lactose  </p><p>usually cheese has very low amounts of lactose 
because the microbes consume that sugar and then  </p><p>they they basically you get more of a protein 
than you would get if you had actual milk or  </p><p>yogurt casein is the protein in dairy which that&rsquo;s 
really high in hard cheeses and it&rsquo;s also lower in  </p><p>soft cheeses it&rsquo;s higher in Greek yogurt so you 
know if you&rsquo;re consuming too much of that protein  </p><p>that could back people up as well back you up so 
you might want to try try goat&rsquo;s cheese or sheep  </p><p>cheese which people can digest that much better 
than actually cheese from cows so you might want  </p><p>to try that as well so these are just things 
to look at in your search to find a solution  </p><p>for constipation put your comments below hi guys 
hey listen I created a pretty amazing evaluation  </p><p>quiz down below that actually analyzes your 
symptoms to find the cause the root cause  </p><p>of all of your symptoms the most likely cause 
so take the quiz now and we&rsquo;ll send you report</p></section><footer class=article-footer><section class=article-tags><a href=/tags/english/>English</a>
