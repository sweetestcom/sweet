<p>so you get the body of the</p>
<p>black man and then you get the mind of the</p>
<p>white man all together in</p>
<p>some strange combination</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s why the</p>
<p>university of arizona won the 1996 national</p>
<p>championship the</p>
<p>whole that doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>by the way mean that</p>
<p>black people don&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>brains it&rsquo;s a different brain</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t get me</p>
<p>wrong what i&rsquo;m saying is clearly</p>
<p>black people have the superior bodies</p>
<p>you got to be</p>
<p>crazy to argue with that</p>
<p>greatest athletes of all time</p>
<p>you know to a man</p>
<p>except for a few</p>
<p>few fucking</p>
<p>larry birds in there a few</p>
<p>weird white guys that manage to figure shit out right</p>
<p>other than that</p>
<p>i mean let&rsquo;s get real</p>
<p>you know they&rsquo;re the</p>
<p>super athletes</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re trekking down</p>
<p>jimmy the greek</p>
<p>territory right now he was</p>
<p>absolutely right he was dead</p>
<p>right he was dead</p>
<p>right he was just a douchebag yeah he</p>
<p>was just a douchebag and it was just like you know what</p>
<p>everything he said you couldn&rsquo;t disagree with</p>
<p>right yeah here&rsquo;s my problem with it it&rsquo;s not a bad</p>
<p>thing you&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about a positive attribute</p>
<p>why is it racist to say that</p>
<p>black people are the superior athletes</p>
<p>if you just looked at the numbers</p>
<p>the number of michael jordan&rsquo;s and lebron</p>
<p>james&rsquo;s and</p>
<p>those guys those superior</p>
<p>super dominant</p>
<p>athletes right</p>
<p>very rare little</p>
<p>white guys make up what fifteen percent of the cop</p>
<p>population american</p>
<p>population less</p>
<p>than that and they make up ninety percent of the nba</p>
<p>with the five hundred</p>
<p>men in the nba come on come on the</p>
<p>white guys are european</p>
<p>yeah you know it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>those russians</p>
<p>the european</p>
<p>see that&rsquo;s another</p>
<p>thing europeans like from</p>
<p>like russians are a different fucking breed</p>
<p>than white people here oh yeah there&rsquo;s some</p>
<p>hard motherfuckers and some serious athletes too</p>
<p>like you ever see</p>
<p>corellan the</p>
<p>wrestler that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>seven foot tall 300 plus</p>
<p>pounds guy that would</p>
<p>hurl grown men through the air</p>
<p>only lost once okay</p>
<p>and the reason why he fought</p>
<p>roulon gardner</p>
<p>wrestled roulon gardner</p>
<p>and it was a new rule in greco roman</p>
<p>where if you lost your grip and then had to reattach it</p>
<p>even if there was no</p>
<p>dominance that guy got a point</p>
<p>just cause he made you</p>
<p>break your grip</p>
<p>oh wow it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>stupidest rule ever</p>
<p>and it was one that didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>exist through</p>
<p>corellans entire reign</p>
<p>we wanna talk</p>
<p>about a fucking</p>
<p>super athlete</p>
<p>i used to call him the experiment</p>
<p>because his parents were like five five and five seven</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s fucking</p>
<p>seven feet tall</p>
<p>and enormous</p>
<p>i mean he doesn&rsquo;t even look like a real man</p>
<p>he looks like some shit from 300</p>
<p>he looks like some shit that the persians</p>
<p>would have with a dog collar on</p>
<p>you know naked with a fucking</p>
<p>a giant iron cod piece</p>
<p>running at you</p>
<p>you didn&rsquo;t rush in blood</p>
<p>yeah dude on podcasts</p>
<p>training in the snow</p>
<p>giant savage</p>
<p>just eating reindeers and shit but that&rsquo;s the anomaly</p>
<p>every once in a while</p>
<p>there is a white guy</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s more pure europeans like that</p>
<p>but pound for</p>
<p>pound in america yeah</p>
<p>the black race is</p>
<p>superior in sports</p>
<p>but here&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>misconception is that you&rsquo;re saying that they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>limited to that and that&rsquo;s not the case at all</p>
<p>well physically you</p>
<p>know it&rsquo;s also you got to deal with it&rsquo;s an economic</p>
<p>issue people from</p>
<p>especially when you deal with</p>
<p>people that are into like combat</p>
<p>sports like the combat one</p>
<p>especially boxing that&rsquo;s a serious economic one oh</p>
<p>yeah very few rich people</p>
<p>get it become professional boxers right the</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s always like it</p>
<p>used to be the jews in new york that was like you know</p>
<p>slappy maxi rosen bloom and</p>
<p>all back in</p>
<p>those days like</p>
<p>jews were a lot of boxers were jews</p>
<p>and then it became italians</p>
<p>and puerto ricans and</p>
<p>irish and it</p>
<p>was really mostly immigrants that were poor</p>
<p>and then eventually you</p>
<p>know blacks and</p>
<p>black athletes</p>
<p>but if you look at like</p>
<p>greatest athletes of all time just only a few like</p>
<p>rocky marcianos in the mix</p>
<p>a few guys that were like</p>
<p>super dominant</p>
<p>that were white guys</p>
<p>wayne gretzky yes yeah</p>
<p>but given a</p>
<p>sport that was</p>
<p>dominated by</p>
<p>whites you know</p>
<p>wayne gretzky</p>
<p>yeah like look at</p>
<p>their attributes</p>
<p>gretzky was like very clever</p>
<p>and an excellent skater</p>
<p>but like rocky marciano was</p>
<p>known for being just</p>
<p>ridiculously</p>
<p>durable and just</p>
<p>always in incredible shape</p>
<p>and would get a</p>
<p>hold of you and eventually wear you down and blast you</p>
<p>so it wasn&rsquo;t like a muhammad ali</p>
<p>where you couldn&rsquo;t even fuck with him like</p>
<p>you were in</p>
<p>front of him</p>
<p>going what am i doing even in the ring with roy</p>
<p>jones jr right</p>
<p>you remember when vidi pasianza fought roy jones</p>
<p>there was a round</p>
<p>where he didn&rsquo;t land a punch</p>
<p>it was the only time ever in</p>
<p>compabox history</p>
<p>where they had</p>
<p>scored an entire round</p>
<p>100 lopsided</p>
<p>the other guy</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t land a single punch</p>
<p>roy jones just lit him up he</p>
<p>was dancing in</p>
<p>front of him like a cobra yeah he fought from down here</p>
<p>he fought for back here and that jab</p>
<p>would come out</p>
<p>slap you in the face you&rsquo;re trying to move your</p>
<p>big fat head you can&rsquo;t get out of the way of it yeah</p>
<p>i use that guy in</p>
<p>fight night</p>
<p>super super and</p>
<p>over ali i use him in</p>
<p>fight night</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s the man</p>
<p>dude he had some</p>
<p>ridiculous attributes but</p>
<p>he had one fuck up</p>
<p>he developed his technique technique</p>
<p>based and dependent upon his physical attributes</p>
<p>instead of going with traditional technique</p>
<p>like bernard hopkins</p>
<p>evander holyfield</p>
<p>guys who do</p>
<p>everything textbook like</p>
<p>james tony does</p>
<p>everything textbook</p>
<p>instead of doing that</p>
<p>he went with this big wide open</p>
<p>loose style</p>
<p>that almost</p>
<p>completely relied upon his physical attributes</p>
<p>so when he started to slow down he</p>
<p>started getting fucked up</p>
<p>when he fought tarver he got fucked up</p>
<p>and that was coming back from the weight loss</p>
<p>cause he fought</p>
<p>heavyweight and when</p>
<p>he got pumped up and then he came from whatever</p>
<p>legal or illegally</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know what the fuck he was doing but he got big</p>
<p>he got over 200 pounds</p>
<p>and really muscular</p>
<p>and then he drops back down to 170</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re looking at him and you&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>175 you&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>okay something&rsquo;s hormonally</p>
<p>wrong here his body looks soft</p>
<p>you know i&rsquo;m looking at this</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m like this is a guy who didn&rsquo;t do this correctly</p>
<p>i bet he jacked his system</p>
<p>when you get on</p>
<p>juice you jack your fucking</p>
<p>system and then</p>
<p>if you get off it if you&rsquo;re not doing it correctly</p>
<p>you get off of it your body</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t bounce back you&rsquo;re not producing testosterone</p>
<p>your body shut down because you made it</p>
<p>have all this</p>
<p>extra shit in your</p>
<p>system and your</p>
<p>balls are like what are we doing let&rsquo;s stop working</p>
<p>so you have to</p>
<p>bring your balls back to life if</p>
<p>you do something like that</p>
<p>what you do it&rsquo;s like really radical chemistry</p>
<p>and he clearly wasn&rsquo;t doing that</p>
<p>right he came back and he looked</p>
<p>really soft</p>
<p>and he got tagged and blasted</p>
<p>it was one of</p>
<p>those things</p>
<p>when you get</p>
<p>blasted once man it&rsquo;s so much easier to get</p>
<p>blasted again</p>
<p>cause then glenn johnson</p>
<p>blasted him</p>
<p>and then it looked really bad it</p>
<p>broke you&rsquo;re cool and that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>thing too it&rsquo;s not just that he goes out</p>
<p>unconscious yeah like</p>
<p>when the glenn johnson fight</p>
<p>it didn&rsquo;t even look like that big of a punch</p>
<p>and he went</p>
<p>completely unconscious</p>
<p>one leg up in the air i mean he was gone</p>
<p>which means it&rsquo;s got</p>
<p>brain damage yeah</p>
<p>i mean that&rsquo;s really what it is yeah</p>
<p>and so then</p>
<p>it was all because of his</p>
<p>two things because his body coming back from being big</p>
<p>against diaz</p>
<p>what was that no ruiz</p>
<p>big against ruiz rather</p>
<p>john ruiz and then</p>
<p>it was also</p>
<p>those two knockouts man</p>
<p>if you have</p>
<p>knockouts man</p>
<p>you know and people you know</p>
<p>they want to poo poo it like it&rsquo;s no big fucking deal</p>
<p>you gotta bounce back from that</p>
<p>thing really slowly and really correctly you</p>
<p>gotta know where your fucking</p>
<p>brain&rsquo;s at cause you</p>
<p>might have loose</p>
<p>screws in there oh yeah you</p>
<p>could be done with</p>
<p>him you could seriously have serious</p>
<p>brain damage</p>
<p>these guys that they get</p>
<p>knocked out once and then</p>
<p>every time they get hit</p>
<p>afterwards they just go</p>
<p>whereas before you used to have iron chins yeah</p>
<p>well that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>thing i grown up</p>
<p>watching mike</p>
<p>tyson all the time</p>
<p>and watching that method of coming out</p>
<p>real close to the body how he would just</p>
<p>like a bear</p>
<p>it was like the</p>
<p>swiftness of</p>
<p>when you see a bear hit somebody</p>
<p>and their shoulders popping all that but as he got</p>
<p>older it was kind of like a</p>
<p>genre specific kind of</p>
<p>technique of boxing that</p>
<p>is a little less traditional it seemed</p>
<p>like you said when somebody gets</p>
<p>knocked out once buzzer douglas</p>
<p>who shouldn&rsquo;t have got the best of them but did</p>
<p>once that that&rsquo;s opened up that mess with your</p>
<p>psyche and to</p>
<p>top it off if you&rsquo;re retarded like him already</p>
<p>do you know how</p>
<p>tough he was man the bad</p>
<p>motherfucker</p>
<p>the fucking bombs he took from holyfield in that</p>
<p>first fight before he went out</p>
<p>god damn he got hit with</p>
<p>everything dude</p>
<p>holyfield was teeing off on him</p>
<p>and he was just taking him and his legs</p>
<p>would buckle</p>
<p>when he finally went down then he&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>searching for his</p>
<p>mouthpiece like holy</p>
<p>shit yeah dude that&rsquo;s a dude who</p>
<p>could take a beating they say all</p>
<p>he took beating but this dude took beating</p>
<p>the buster douglas one dude that combination that he</p>
<p>blasted tyson with</p>
<p>and tyson still trying to put his</p>
<p>mouthpiece back in</p>
<p>that motherfucker was game to the end</p>
<p>blasted out</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>scratching around looking for his</p>
<p>mouthpiece yeah</p>
<p>to get back in his mouth</p>
<p>because he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna fuck you up yeah</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s gonna get up and he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna fuck you up yeah</p>
<p>yeah he got</p>
<p>knocked out i</p>
<p>think one time</p>
<p>in a sparring</p>
<p>match when he was a kid like 15 16</p>
<p>something like that and he&rsquo;s one of</p>
<p>those boxers that goes somewhere and cries</p>
<p>and then comes back and murders you</p>
<p>and he did that</p>
<p>apparently he did that to who</p>
<p>was one of his old guys atlas with somebody like he was</p>
<p>training with some</p>
<p>and the dude got the best of him and a</p>
<p>spar and tyson went somewhere cried shivered</p>
<p>held his knees</p>
<p>and then came out and just</p>
<p>dropped bombs and</p>
<p>never looked back</p>
<p>so terrifying a guy who needs it that much</p>
<p>a guy who needs it so much is everything</p>
<p>about him his entire</p>
<p>self worth entire</p>
<p>self esteem is</p>
<p>just all based on him</p>
<p>fucking smashing you</p>
<p>just running at you and destroying you as a</p>
<p>human body to body</p>
<p>just imposing his fucking physical will on you and he</p>
<p>still has that</p>
<p>thing about him that</p>
<p>i see him on sunset</p>
<p>every once in a</p>
<p>while and just like even if you</p>
<p>catch his eyes</p>
<p>with you here just you know it&rsquo;s like hey mike</p>
<p>yeah it&rsquo;s like that guy is just a killer bro he&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>train killer he&rsquo;s got the show now he&rsquo;s got</p>
<p>a pigeon homing pigeons that&rsquo;s what he does right</p>
<p>like they do in brooklyn and puerto rico yeah</p>
<p>they home pigeons i guess</p>
<p>the whole idea is you compete</p>
<p>against mike</p>
<p>to really is it home</p>
<p>for pigeons i</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t let him win</p>
<p>i would always</p>
<p>let him win he snaps your pigeons next you know yeah</p>
<p>fuck you dude i&rsquo;ll let you win man</p>
<p>i&rsquo;d let him win at</p>
<p>everything but i&rsquo;ve said it i&rsquo;ve said</p>
<p>it i&rsquo;ll take him and mike</p>
<p>tyson&rsquo;s punch out i&rsquo;ll knock</p>
<p>him out first</p>
<p>round you mean just</p>
<p>punch out now just</p>
<p>punch yeah just</p>
<p>punch out now i</p>
<p>think he has a new game</p>
<p>i thought he spammed me but</p>
<p>apparently it wasn&rsquo;t spam</p>
<p>i got a tweet from his account</p>
<p>and i was like oh my god mike</p>
<p>tyson just fucking spammed me and i</p>
<p>wrote that at twitter</p>
<p>and then he said it&rsquo;s not spam joe</p>
<p>and i was like oh the real</p>
<p>mike i think oh</p>
<p>man i mean it</p>
<p>might be some people that work for it verified</p>
<p>have we said anything bad no</p>
<p>i mean i would</p>
<p>never say anything bad</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m a huge fan</p>
<p>sorry me too please don&rsquo;t iron mike</p>
<p>messiah don&rsquo;t eat my ears yeah</p>
<p>we love you mikey</p>
<p>you want to go back to like ferocious boxers all</p>
<p>those the time when he was a</p>
<p>champion there was no time like that</p>
<p>where you like you were just waiting for this execution</p>
<p>it wasn&rsquo;t a</p>
<p>fight it was an execution</p>
<p>you know when</p>
<p>sugary leonard was the baddest</p>
<p>motherfucker around</p>
<p>and like oh shit</p>
<p>sugary leonard they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna have a rematch with</p>
<p>thomas hearns you know like</p>
<p>it was like it was</p>
<p>exciting yeah but you didn&rsquo;t know who was</p>
<p>gonna win right</p>
<p>you know you knew mike tyson was</p>
<p>gonna victimize somebody on hbo</p>
<p>and you were</p>
<p>gonna watch it you were</p>
<p>gonna pay 45</p>
<p>bucks we saw mike</p>
<p>tyson fight tony tubbs what the fuck did you</p>
<p>you think was</p>
<p>gonna happen</p>
<p>yeah what the</p>
<p>fuck did you</p>
<p>think well you know what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>funny is my</p>
<p>granddad some old</p>
<p>school dude</p>
<p>loved the friday night</p>
<p>fights and all that and</p>
<p>it wasn&rsquo;t with mike</p>
<p>tyson at it at all most</p>
<p>granddads weren&rsquo;t he&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>he ain&rsquo;t shit you know talking</p>
<p>all that shit</p>
<p>right wait wait till</p>
<p>larry holmes gets a hold of him</p>
<p>yeah he got a hold of</p>
<p>larry holmes</p>
<p>larry holmes i</p>
<p>think he was</p>
<p>quoted as saying that</p>
<p>man hits harder than anything i&rsquo;ve ever felt in my life</p>
<p>he was on a totally different</p>
<p>level i would have</p>
<p>loved to seeing him at his very best</p>
<p>against everybody</p>
<p>not saying he</p>
<p>would have beat nali</p>
<p>but man would that have been</p>
<p>exciting yeah you can</p>
<p>never say who can do what but you</p>
<p>never know i&rsquo;m privy to him</p>
<p>because i was part of that</p>
<p>generation you know</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s better technical boxers you know</p>
<p>there was better</p>
<p>like lennox lewis</p>
<p>at his best was</p>
<p>a better technical boxer and he was a hard guy to crack</p>
<p>he would have been interesting</p>
<p>when by the time</p>
<p>tyson fought him</p>
<p>tyson was already older</p>
<p>and he had already really lost most of his</p>
<p>motivation he just wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>the same he was trying to get a pay day and he even</p>
<p>admitted it</p>
<p>after the fight</p>
<p>but when he was</p>
<p>younger man that wasn&rsquo;t the case when he was younger</p>
<p>it was a totally different animal</p>
<p>that would have been it</p>
<p>would have been interesting to see him</p>
<p>at his very best like in</p>
<p>the larry holmes</p>
<p>fight that was at him at his very best he was</p>
<p>a destroyer michael spinks yeah</p>
<p>yeah i would have</p>
<p>loved to see that guy</p>
<p>against ali what</p>
<p>21 he was at his</p>
<p>i wouldn&rsquo;t say the apex of his</p>
<p>talent it was just that at that when the custom</p>
<p>motto died around then</p>
<p>when he had one he hadn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>slipped yet as we had it</p>
<p>slipped yet and then when custom</p>
<p>motto died and you&rsquo;re pretty much in don</p>
<p>kings hands i</p>
<p>think that creates like</p>
<p>now you have the</p>
<p>you know one of the</p>
<p>greatest athletes that ever</p>
<p>lived the killing machines</p>
<p>right if it&rsquo;s in the</p>
<p>wrong hands</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not fostered</p>
<p>right it&rsquo;s gonna be</p>
<p>used the wrong way</p>
<p>cause i always feel like he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>got a great</p>
<p>heart you know what i mean like</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s one of these guys</p>
<p>who you can</p>
<p>see his emotion you can see him and he was just always</p>
<p>jerked around by the</p>
<p>wrong people</p>
<p>you know well that&rsquo;s definitely</p>
<p>gonna be the case</p>
<p>in any situation</p>
<p>where you got some</p>
<p>powerful fucking kid that can make you a lot of</p>
<p>money yeah you know you know you</p>
<p>can do whatever they want to do with you and</p>
<p>help you in some ways and support you and</p>
<p>make sure that you make money</p>
<p>but at the end of the day they&rsquo;re just trying to</p>
<p>trying to push you around may</p>
<p>you imagine how conti</p>
<p>robin gibbons must have been there</p>
<p>when they were</p>
<p>married sha harvard</p>
<p>graduate with mike</p>
<p>tyson remember that fucking interview they did</p>
<p>where she was</p>
<p>throwing him</p>
<p>under the bus</p>
<p>about how crazy he is and the violent</p>
<p>and this is</p>
<p>on tv and he&rsquo;s just sitting there like what we came</p>
<p>in barbara walters</p>
<p>right and he&rsquo;s just sitting there</p>
<p>just taking the beam i can&rsquo;t believe this bitch is</p>
<p>gonna go out like this yeah i</p>
<p>could snap her i&rsquo;m the</p>
<p>man i can&rsquo;t believe</p>
<p>this i can&rsquo;t believe all the</p>
<p>things i&rsquo;ve done to save her life</p>
<p>head of the</p>
<p>class that&rsquo;s the best she had done he had</p>
<p>knocked niggas out left and</p>
<p>right and she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna go in and drag him</p>
<p>under the bus now please</p>
<p>she was beautiful she wasn&rsquo;t no</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the problem when</p>

<p>yeah it&rsquo;s a broken</p>
<p>human issue</p>
<p>people it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>annoying having children too you see this so fucking</p>
<p>clearly like you have a</p>
<p>direct input</p>
<p>on how this</p>
<p>human being develops very</p>
<p>very direct</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s real</p>
<p>clear you teach some good</p>
<p>things and then they repeat those good</p>
<p>things and you see them hugging little girls and</p>
<p>having fun you see like</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s all this good energy is coming out of your kids</p>
<p>and then you see</p>
<p>these fucking people that are smoking and yelling at</p>
<p>their kid and</p>
<p>their kids beating another kid with a stick</p>

<p>savages it&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>clear it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re what they are is bundles of potential</p>
<p>yeah but you</p>
<p>gotta fucking raise</p>
<p>the raising a</p>
<p>human being and developing a</p>
<p>human being</p>
<p>is one of the most complex and demanding tasks</p>
<p>a fucking human being can</p>
<p>undertaken and</p>
<p>one of the most important because it</p>
<p>literally the</p>
<p>the the quality</p>
<p>of the fucking society around it is</p>
<p>based on how well</p>
<p>the people inside of this</p>
<p>group are at raising</p>
<p>their children that&rsquo;s the number one</p>
<p>concern if you are terrible at raising your children</p>

<p>break into cars they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna be pains in the</p>
<p>asses they&rsquo;re gonna</p>

<p>guys will come to you with some stupid</p>
<p>stupid shit like yeah man i can&rsquo;t catch a</p>
<p>break man i was this girl</p>
<p>you know and</p>
<p>i thought she was the one and i was</p>
<p>ready to get</p>
<p>married and i got the ring</p>
<p>and i came over a fucking</p>
<p>apartment a day</p>
<p>earlier and she&rsquo;s fucking this guy</p>
<p>and i can&rsquo;t fucking believe it bro</p>
<p>i mean i can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>catch a break</p>
<p>what do you mean can&rsquo;t catch a</p>
<p>break you just got the best</p>
<p>break ever you almost</p>
<p>married that</p>
<p>crazy hooker</p>
<p>right you were</p>
<p>coming over there with a ring and she&rsquo;s sucking some</p>
<p>other guy&rsquo;s cock</p>
<p>you got like</p>
<p>clear evidence that</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s a skank</p>
<p>you this is a time machine bro</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re able to go into the future see how this</p>
<p>would have turned out</p>
<p>you can nip it at the bud</p>
<p>right here and you</p>
<p>you saved yourself</p>
<p>attorney&rsquo;s fees in a long lengthy process</p>
<p>yeah you caught an awesome</p>
<p>break you can&rsquo;t catch a</p>
<p>break you just can&rsquo;t handle your</p>
<p>break it&rsquo;s all a matter of perspective you just want</p>
<p>everything to be perfect</p>
<p>right it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>gonna be perfect but</p>
<p>you just caught a huge</p>
<p>break that guy</p>
<p>realistically he should</p>
<p>shed a couple tears</p>
<p>and then start</p>
<p>laughing and go god</p>
<p>damn i got off life</p>
<p>think about what if you had kids with this</p>
<p>crazy you work</p>
<p>home with kids and their</p>
<p>happy meals and moms sitting on some so</p>
<p>some cars come</p>
<p>right in the living room hoping to get it done</p>
<p>quick before</p>
<p>her husband comes home but they don&rsquo;t time it</p>
<p>right and you walk in</p>
<p>like that&rsquo;s how</p>
<p>crazy that bitch is</p>
<p>your kids are</p>
<p>watching her sucking off some giant</p>
<p>black fucking telephone worker</p>
<p>and then you have to consider this you have to consider</p>
<p>you have to consider</p>
<p>why are you attracting</p>
<p>these kind of</p>
<p>chicks into your life to begin with</p>
<p>are you that</p>
<p>big of a dope that you attracted some kind of</p>
<p>chick like that well sometimes they</p>
<p>trick you just by being hot</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a real problem with dudes i don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a warning girl</p>
<p>being hot it must be the same problem with</p>
<p>girls because girls wind up with jerky guys you know</p>
<p>those jerky guys must just fuck</p>
<p>the shit out of them no yeah that&rsquo;s probably what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going on there</p>
<p>a little bit of</p>
<p>you know a little</p>
<p>bit of you know some sort of a problem in</p>
<p>their personality some sort of a</p>
<p>this weird disorder</p>
<p>where they can&rsquo;t get someone out of</p>
<p>their life there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the people that have that</p>
<p>what do they call that</p>
<p>like they have some kind of codependency</p>
<p>issue yeah codependent</p>
<p>issues yeah</p>
<p>yeah i mean there&rsquo;s people that have that but</p>
<p>other than that you</p>
<p>gotta think</p>
<p>that guy&rsquo;s probably fucking</p>
<p>the shit out of that girl</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just like i don&rsquo;t get people who are in</p>
<p>these miserable fucking relationships it&rsquo;s like i love</p>
<p>my girl i love her</p>
<p>cause she&rsquo;s fun to kick it with and</p>
<p>i like to hang out with her you know what i mean you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>lucky if i didn&rsquo;t like her</p>
<p>i get rid of her</p>
<p>i think here&rsquo;s two</p>
<p>keys number one you like yourself yeah</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s huge yeah and</p>
<p>your girl likes herself too so you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re both happy</p>
<p>right and as</p>
<p>happy as you can be</p>
<p>reason it&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>magical it&rsquo;s not like</p>
<p>every day we wake up it&rsquo;s like oh</p>
<p>honey i love you so much</p>
<p>we wake up it&rsquo;s like don&rsquo;t even talk</p>
<p>right right but it&rsquo;s like if you can get</p>
<p>if two people</p>
<p>can live their lives and not break each</p>
<p>other&rsquo;s balls</p>
<p>not create drama that kind of</p>
<p>thing and i know that</p>
<p>sounds very</p>
<p>nirvana and ideal</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s possible though but it</p>
<p>is possible because i&rsquo;m not asking for too much either</p>
<p>right you know what i mean</p>
<p>right you have</p>
<p>to be you have to be reasonable and you have to be even</p>
<p>in like what you</p>
<p>expect out of that</p>
<p>person and you know how you how you deal with them too</p>
<p>and i know who i can be i can</p>
<p>be a real dick</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like you know we&rsquo;re guys girls says something</p>
<p>stupid you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna be a dick back</p>
<p>especially like if you&rsquo;re really struggling</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re really</p>
<p>trying to put it down it&rsquo;s hard man you get that</p>
<p>grinding mentality</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re always like trying to go go go get</p>
<p>ahead get ahead get ahead</p>
<p>and then when someone trips that up with</p>
<p>i need too much attention i need this i need that</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s very difficult to be</p>
<p>considerate</p>
<p>you feel like will you shut the fuck up and</p>
<p>leave me alone yeah i got shit</p>
<p>going on here and then you</p>
<p>start to realize that</p>
<p>after a few years that that</p>
<p>never serves you well</p>
<p>cause now you&rsquo;ve got a six hour</p>
<p>fight instead of a two hour fight</p>
<p>and you know and you were partially to</p>
<p>blame i always try</p>
<p>to step back</p>
<p>i always try to fix it though i always stay in</p>
<p>relationships longer because i&rsquo;m like you know what i</p>
<p>should try to work together with something like</p>
<p>a problem because i mean like if it was anything</p>
<p>like if i was sick down the line what is she just</p>
<p>gonna drop me because i&rsquo;m sick</p>
<p>no you should</p>
<p>right so i always have that</p>
<p>mentality so</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve been in relationships where</p>
<p>i lasted an</p>
<p>extra year and a half</p>
<p>and it was just trying to fix</p>
<p>the relationship</p>
<p>sometimes it works i</p>
<p>mean people have gotten</p>
<p>rough patches in</p>
<p>their relationships and they pull themselves out of it</p>
<p>but but it&rsquo;s like what are you accepting though</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t fix</p>
<p>that other person</p>
<p>you know i can&rsquo;t and that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>thing i&rsquo;m not in it to fix that</p>
<p>other person</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like i accept that and then i&rsquo;ll work on the</p>
<p>things like</p>
<p>myself like i&rsquo;ll act like my dad sometimes just</p>
<p>clam up and be like a 1950s dickhead dad you know</p>
<p>just reading the</p>
<p>papers smoking and</p>
<p>drinking and don&rsquo;t even fucking talk to me</p>
<p>you know i&rsquo;ll be like that then i&rsquo;ll have to</p>
<p>snap myself out of it because i&rsquo;d be like alright you</p>
<p>know look at</p>
<p>it from her side who wants to be with this asshole</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like knowing a little bit</p>
<p>about yourself</p>
<p>too and working on that plus we&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about girls that just</p>
<p>learned to drive like</p>
<p>three years ago yeah</p>
<p>they still got a</p>
<p>brain that&rsquo;s like trying to</p>
<p>learn how life</p>
<p>operates and</p>

<p>expect him to</p>
<p>bring a boner</p>
<p>everywhere he went yeah and whip</p>
<p>it out too like hey you guys like boners you know</p>
<p>and he prides himself on not</p>
<p>using viagra</p>
<p>he doesn&rsquo;t give a fuck oh</p>
<p>cause i don&rsquo;t use it i don&rsquo;t believe in it</p>
<p>yeah fucking animal</p>
<p>i can&rsquo;t believe</p>
<p>i couldn&rsquo;t imagine him not doing something every</p>
<p>venereal disease that&rsquo;s ever</p>
<p>existed is fighting</p>
<p>against each</p>
<p>other to the</p>
<p>death inside his body</p>
<p>yeah yeah they&rsquo;re all just</p>
<p>duking it out</p>
<p>he stays like i bet</p>
<p>if he takes tests he has nothing he shows completely</p>
<p>clean i know</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re all</p>
<p>killing each other</p>
<p>it looks like the battle of gettysburg herpes</p>
<p>versus age just</p>
<p>going at it there&rsquo;s no</p>
<p>antibodies necessary because the</p>
<p>viruses just</p>
<p>fight themselves yeah</p>
<p>the t cells are on the sidelines laughing</p>
<p>yeah everyone&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>jesus this is just an internal warfare</p>
<p>if someone wins then he&rsquo;s got a real</p>
<p>issue cause then the host</p>
<p>will get attacked</p>
<p>i guess i i feel somewhat comforted to know he</p>
<p>would act like</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s almost like finding out michael jordan</p>
<p>i met michael jordan one time and he talked basketball</p>
<p>and he talked it openly and i was very</p>
<p>happy about that</p>
<p>right i got</p>
<p>to talk basketball</p>
<p>you know you got to talk puss with</p>
<p>with a pus smith</p>
<p>essentially you know it&rsquo;s like in</p>
<p>ron jeremy and it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>you know sometimes you want</p>
<p>somebody he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s an ambassador of what he does i</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s fair yeah</p>
<p>yeah so you want</p>
<p>him to be an ambassador</p>
<p>yeah you don&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>ron jeremy to be fucking doing yoga and</p>
<p>drinking wheatgrass yeah</p>
<p>exactly banging hoes at</p>
<p>every bus stop</p>
<p>right the that&rsquo;s what he&rsquo;s doing it&rsquo;s goddamn</p>
<p>ron jeremy i actually</p>
<p>found it awesome</p>
<p>at the end of the shoot</p>
<p>he comes up and goes</p>
<p>so if you want to come to the rainbow room</p>

<p>gonna get online</p>
<p>right they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna do this</p>
<p>online i mean they&rsquo;re not really porn stars i mean</p>

<p>to vivid and worked on you talk</p>
<p>about casting couches or yeah</p>
<p>those are all like</p>
<p>you know yeah yeah</p>
<p>no some of them are fake they all</p>
<p>they can&rsquo;t film it</p>
<p>unless they have already</p>
<p>done a drug test or if they&rsquo;ve already signed all</p>
<p>their papers like</p>
<p>every part of the country</p>
<p>in at least most</p>
<p>at least unites i mean that&rsquo;s probably</p>
<p>the rules i bet that&rsquo;s the rules but i&rsquo;m sure</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s people</p>
<p>out there gorillaing they&rsquo;re pretty hardcore</p>
<p>about it yeah they are pretty hardcore</p>
<p>about it i&rsquo;ve seen</p>

<p>yep it&rsquo;s just to get a drug test</p>
<p>or or not drug test ai</p>
<p>states test</p>
<p>in the whole country in the</p>
<p>whole country are you positive</p>
<p>about that i&rsquo;m pretty positive i&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>we should research</p>
<p>that i know at</p>
<p>least okay let&rsquo;s not talk about that</p>
<p>until we figure this out because this is a</p>
<p>silly conversation that</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s the main crux of the issue</p>
<p>right i mean i know a lot of them are fake but</p>
<p>a lot of them like this girl from asu this a</p>
<p>perfect example that&rsquo;s fake</p>
<p>those are porn stars right</p>

<p>whole like the</p>
<p>whole thing you</p>

<p>set up right all that one but not all of them</p>
<p>right these gorilla ones</p>
<p>where you don&rsquo;t even see the guy&rsquo;s face</p>
<p>yeah there&rsquo;s got to be some there&rsquo;s a lot of growth</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s on a website that&rsquo;s making</p>
<p>money and it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>legit website</p>
<p>then yes it&rsquo;s fake</p>
<p>where would we find this out</p>
<p>uh hold on make a phone call</p>

<p>porn rules what</p>
<p>would you google</p>
<p>freddy locker</p>

<p>right now bro</p>
<p>on the la weekly</p>
<p>porn stars in</p>
<p>california will see</p>
<p>stricter safety rules on how they do their</p>
<p>thing on set</p>
<p>just like construction</p>
<p>worker has to wear a hard hat they</p>
<p>might have to do don</p>
<p>condoms and cement to tests</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re saying they don&rsquo;t have mandatory tests yet</p>
<p>for my understanding it&rsquo;s already been mandatory</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know really yeah</p>
<p>why they saying this in</p>
<p>la weekly then bro</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>these bitches</p>
<p>are telling you they&rsquo;re getting tested and you just</p>
<p>no no because</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m fucking living off</p>
<p>those tests i&rsquo;m like let me</p>
<p>see oh cool i don&rsquo;t have aids</p>
<p>again this week that</p>
<p>la weekly is free</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t have any reason to lie to me</p>
<p>yeah i don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>la is lying</p>
<p>oh i know that what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>been lately is the condom laws</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re trying to make it so i</p>
<p>think they&rsquo;ve already made it</p>
<p>sound mandatory bro here&rsquo;s the deal in porn</p>
<p>world in la they already test</p>
<p>their performers regularly</p>
<p>that hasn&rsquo;t stopped diseases including hiv</p>
<p>positive scandal for one gay performer last year yeah</p>
<p>apparently it&rsquo;s not they do it they do it a lot</p>
<p>but it doesn&rsquo;t seem to be</p>
<p>like a law so the girl at asu</p>
<p>sounds real though i</p>
<p>think that some of my i</p>
<p>think it is real</p>
<p>some of the followers are from asu</p>
<p>i think there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>an asu mackenzie following me find out that asu well</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s been a few guys that posted on our board</p>
<p>that were porn guys one of them man</p>
<p>did just really humiliation porn</p>
<p>he would like it was</p>
<p>really kind of depressing</p>
<p>he would tell the stories</p>
<p>about how he roped</p>
<p>these chicks in and how</p>
<p>like you know a lot of them were like single moms and</p>
<p>they needed</p>
<p>money for the rent</p>
<p>and how he would</p>
<p>hook it up and the next</p>
<p>thing you know they</p>
<p>would do be doing like internet porn forum</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really</p>
<p>crazy yeah i mean i</p>
<p>would imagine everybody recruiting</p>
<p>especially for the internet porn is</p>
<p>gonna be sleazy</p>
<p>cause you&rsquo;re gonna go</p>
<p>after who&rsquo;s weak just like a</p>
<p>you know a military recruiter is</p>
<p>gonna go after</p>
<p>a 17 year old</p>
<p>i just confuse</p>
<p>his stories again</p>
<p>the guy who was the</p>
<p>bringing in the</p>
<p>women and getting and paying for the rent and shit like</p>
<p>that that wasn&rsquo;t a porn guy he was a guy who used to</p>
<p>write stories</p>
<p>about it he had a website about it</p>
<p>i completely confused it</p>
<p>the porn guys</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a different story</p>
<p>damn i hate when i do that</p>
<p>when the stories that you really</p>
<p>never thought</p>
<p>about for years</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re somewhere in the back your head</p>
<p>then you combine them together and you&rsquo;re like wait a</p>
<p>minute you guys stop moving</p>
<p>yeah stay still</p>
<p>what are you doing wearing his</p>
<p>clothes you get over there</p>
<p>you know you fuckers you</p>
<p>tricked me there for a</p>
<p>second let&rsquo;s say i get that all the time or</p>
<p>you just simply thought you made it up i thought i&rsquo;d</p>
<p>made i remember in</p>
<p>fifth grade we buried a time</p>
<p>capsule in our school</p>
<p>and i was driving the</p>
<p>other day and</p>
<p>i was like holy shit we buried a fucking time</p>
<p>capsule it was 89</p>
<p>i was like i wonder if they</p>
<p>dug it up so i</p>
<p>emailed the</p>
<p>school that i went to back in 89 i was like hey</p>
<p>my name is freddie lockhart</p>
<p>yeah i said my name is freddie lockhart you</p>
<p>know i went to</p>
<p>school there in 89</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m curious we buried a time</p>
<p>capsule did you guys find it she&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>funny enough we did</p>
<p>you know unearth it</p>
<p>and it had some</p>
<p>water damage but</p>
<p>in my mind i thought we</p>
<p>stuck like a game boy in there i</p>
<p>think what i&rsquo;m doing is just associating all</p>
<p>things 1989 we shoved in there</p>
<p>but in 1989 i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think any kid on</p>
<p>earth would</p>
<p>spare their fucking game boy</p>
<p>for a capsule a time capsule</p>
<p>i think what it just was was like</p>
<p>pictures and</p>
<p>prices of candy bars and shit</p>
<p>but i was just so compelled by just that</p>
<p>that memory popping in my head</p>
<p>i got with that lady and</p>
<p>sounds like she&rsquo;s probably been there this</p>
<p>whole time too she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like it&rsquo;s always nice to hear from former students</p>
<p>and yes we did dig it up i was like bitch</p>
<p>what was the treasure in there or what it turns out</p>
<p>just papers and shit</p>
<p>no game boy</p>
<p>i thought for</p>
<p>sure i had a game boy in there it was just papers</p>
<p>like you know like newspapers and</p>
<p>things of the day</p>
<p>but to me it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like i&rsquo;m more impressed like i wanted to see</p>
<p>since the technological revolution has gone leaps and</p>
<p>bounds since 1989 to now</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what we</p>
<p>should have put in there is like you know some outdated</p>
<p>shit so we could</p>
<p>laugh at it now have you ever thought</p>
<p>about like buying one of</p>
<p>those off of</p>
<p>like amazon or ebay or something like that just</p>
<p>to see what it&rsquo;s like to play with it now what&rsquo;s that</p>
<p>some old ass game boy</p>
<p>oh i have all</p>
<p>the old ass game boy that you have all that</p>
<p>stuff i have all the</p>
<p>atari i have all the</p>
<p>boxes i have all</p>
<p>those really</p>
<p>i have no storage why do you</p>
<p>think my office is so crap</p>
<p>i have an old intent</p>
<p>i was telling him earlier</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a show</p>
<p>on justin tv this guy</p>
<p>guy called the</p>
<p>angry gamer you</p>
<p>seen it and this guy&rsquo;s fucking hilarious he says nerd i</p>
<p>guess he&rsquo;s like in his</p>
<p>early thirties but he reviews old</p>
<p>video games it&rsquo;s his</p>
<p>whole job he&rsquo;s got this</p>
<p>whole basement</p>
<p>nintendo games as</p>
<p>far as the eyes can see sega genesis games you name it</p>
<p>he&rsquo;ll review it but as an</p>
<p>adult an intellectual</p>
<p>adult who curses like a sailor</p>
<p>he&rsquo;ll review the game</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;ll take you</p>
<p>back to when you&rsquo;re nine years old and you&rsquo;re playing</p>
<p>rygar or something</p>
<p>like how the fuck do i jump over here</p>
<p>he uncovers glitches and he shows you that i was</p>
<p>right there was no way to do that</p>
<p>the whole time but i got to</p>
<p>watching this dude shit like nine episodes</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s just pissed</p>
<p>about everything</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like now i&rsquo;ll play it on the original game boy</p>
<p>this game fucking sucks</p>
<p>he never likes anything but he</p>
<p>voices your frustrations as a nine year old as an</p>
<p>adult that&rsquo;s so weird</p>
<p>i think what is it the</p>
<p>angry gamer i</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s fucking hilarious</p>
<p>fucking hilarious so weird</p>
<p>reviewing old shit it&rsquo;s retro</p>
<p>reviews though</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s cool shit you know</p>
<p>especially to</p>
<p>go back and really review something from an</p>
<p>adult perspective i thought it was</p>
<p>just a dumb kid i was like ah i can&rsquo;t figure it out it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t work</p>
<p>but now i realize</p>
<p>i was a dumb kid</p>
<p>but there was a glitch as well</p>
<p>yeah fucking</p>
<p>retro gaming it&rsquo;s pretty amazing i bought something the</p>
<p>other day on my ipad i&rsquo;m like you know what</p>
<p>is it like an old</p>
<p>classic game i was like i</p>
<p>think this is</p>
<p>probably the</p>
<p>sixth time i&rsquo;ve bought this game oh yeah</p>
<p>like pac man i&rsquo;ve bought pac man</p>
<p>at least 20 times in my life and who knows how many</p>
<p>quarters spent</p>
<p>on arcade version two</p>
<p>yeah imagine trying to explain</p>
<p>video games to someone in the middle ages</p>
<p>yeah i know it was</p>
<p>where do you</p>
<p>start okay you know what 8 bits are</p>
<p>all right you know how you draw</p>
<p>pictures now</p>
<p>imagine that moving not even</p>
<p>trolling no you control it with a mouse</p>
<p>sounds like</p>
<p>a keyboard yeah</p>
<p>i imagine trying to</p>
<p>explain how to work an iphone to somebody 10 years ago</p>
<p>imagine getting</p>
<p>split yeah right</p>
<p>touchscreen yeah</p>
<p>there was that episode</p>
<p>of the show journeyman did you guys ever see that show</p>
<p>short lived time</p>
<p>traveling series on abc</p>
<p>journeyman i</p>
<p>think it was like 2007</p>
<p>and it was really fucking good of course i&rsquo;m a time</p>
<p>travel nerd so i was probably the only one</p>
<p>watching it</p>
<p>but he goes back to like 1981 and he gets shot</p>
<p>and he has to go seek medical attention at the hospital</p>
<p>they find his iphone laying on his</p>
<p>chest and this doctors like what the fuck</p>
<p>like scrolling through and i love that shit</p>
<p>just to see</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what i</p>
<p>would time travel to go blow</p>
<p>people&rsquo;s minds with shit yeah if you showed someone</p>
<p>an iphone just 20 years ago they</p>
<p>would really</p>
<p>really fucking freak out</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s amazing how you</p>
<p>could touch the screen</p>
<p>and it knows like</p>
<p>where your finger</p>
<p>touches like for letters and shit like</p>
<p>that yeah it&rsquo;s amazing how accurate that is but you</p>
<p>know how long the shits been out though go look like</p>
<p>the first touchscreen</p>
<p>phone was like</p>
<p>sprint or somebody put one out nineteen ninety two</p>
<p>and it was an all</p>
<p>touchscreen</p>
<p>color phone it</p>
<p>was of course it was like 2 000 bucks</p>
<p>like google first</p>

<p>and we&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>whoa what the fuck is that he&rsquo;s like this is a newton</p>
<p>i didn&rsquo;t know that was</p>
<p>released yeah it was for a couple years</p>
<p>wow this is like 93 94</p>
<p>somewhere around</p>
<p>then yeah they did them 92 93 94 at the end you</p>
<p>could email</p>
<p>from them too</p>
<p>you could fax</p>
<p>email do all that</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s incredible</p>
<p>that was pc only</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s so back in the day man it</p>
<p>really is it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>funny when you think</p>
<p>about it but it&rsquo;s like all that</p>
<p>stuff it was</p>
<p>they knew they</p>
<p>wanted to do that shit what i want to do is go blow</p>
<p>steve jobs his mind and show him the shit he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna invent but show him when he&rsquo;s 20</p>
<p>yeah you know</p>
<p>yeah right yeah no kidding look what you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna come up with</p>
<p>yeah well you&rsquo;d probably ruin it all</p>
<p>yeah you would you&rsquo;d fuck up</p>
<p>everything in time if he knew that he was</p>
<p>going to be that</p>
<p>successful maybe he</p>
<p>wouldn&rsquo;t work as hard</p>
<p>so in that journeyman what happened is he</p>
<p>leaves his iphone back there</p>
<p>and nanotechnology has now</p>
<p>sped up 30 years because</p>
<p>he left it back in the past so he gets back to his</p>
<p>present and</p>
<p>nanotechnology rules the world</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s just nothing but like</p>
<p>what is this in</p>
<p>what is this</p>
<p>journeyman it&rsquo;s called a journeyman it was a</p>
<p>one season on abc</p>
<p>fucking fantastic really it&rsquo;s on hulu you can</p>
<p>catch all the episodes on hulu and we just</p>
<p>it got cancelled or got cancelled you know it is big</p>
<p>budget time</p>
<p>travel small</p>
<p>brains don&rsquo;t pick up you know journeyman i never even</p>
<p>heard of it</p>
<p>yeah it was</p>
<p>short it was really good</p>
<p>it was really good it</p>
<p>was done in the way that you wanted it to be done time</p>
<p>travel like they really hit the</p>
<p>things i wanted</p>
<p>to see did they end it like they knew they</p>
<p>were ending it or did they just end it out of the blue</p>
<p>it seems like they</p>
<p>ended it out of the blue it&rsquo;s probably one of</p>
<p>those things we went to christmas</p>
<p>break really bitches</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s up in the air</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s over kids</p>
<p>i was at target the</p>
<p>other day fucking just looking at cameras</p>
<p>cause like my little</p>
<p>digital camera thing</p>
<p>broke and so i&rsquo;m trying to find like a little</p>
<p>small camera and</p>
<p>all the cameras were out of stock</p>
<p>because of the</p>
<p>japan thing</p>
<p>and then i read the</p>
<p>other day that the new iphone is now</p>
<p>rumored to be in september</p>
<p>instead of june</p>
<p>maybe because of the</p>
<p>japan thing i&rsquo;m not sure</p>
<p>but i&rsquo;m just amazed like how</p>
<p>much that fucking shit has affected</p>
<p>you know that&rsquo;s nothing dude me buying a camera yeah</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a tiny</p>
<p>thing that&rsquo;s a tiny</p>
<p>thing the real</p>
<p>issue is this fucking</p>
<p>the radiations coming out of there now man do you think</p>
<p>japan&rsquo;s unlivable now do you think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>well they&rsquo;ve jacked it up to chernobyl</p>
<p>level 7 there yeah</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think it was</p>
<p>gonna get that bad</p>
<p>they said it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>still not as bad as chernobyl</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s more contained</p>
<p>and chernobyl had ash fires that burned for days and</p>
<p>spread the shit and spread the</p>
<p>radioactive material</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s problematic man it&rsquo;s a big big</p>
<p>issue and they don&rsquo;t know how much</p>
<p>worse it&rsquo;s going to get and</p>
<p>they keep getting</p>
<p>earthquakes there too they had another one the</p>
<p>other day a</p>
<p>strong seven</p>
<p>and it never gets better</p>
<p>right radiation you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>always gonna be there</p>
<p>right that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like deadly for a hundred thousand years right</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll be fucked up for so long</p>
<p>fucking asians are</p>
<p>gonna actually have tentacles coming out of them</p>
<p>the idea that we have this i mean</p>
<p>nuclear power is one of the all time</p>
<p>craziest ideas and everybody was like nuclear powers</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s one of</p>
<p>these things he&rsquo;s fucking</p>
<p>tie wearing republican cunt bags</p>
<p>these assholes that are always like hey</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the alarm</p>
<p>what do you</p>
<p>alarm is these</p>
<p>liberals want to</p>
<p>listen there&rsquo;s nothing</p>
<p>wrong with nuclear</p>
<p>power nuclear powers clean</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s safe like outside of three</p>
<p>three mile island in chernobyl</p>
<p>where&rsquo;s the problems we&rsquo;ve had nuclear</p>
<p>power for 30 years</p>
<p>30 years is a goddamn</p>
<p>blink of an eye</p>
<p>this it&rsquo;s nothing</p>
<p>if human beings are</p>
<p>gonna exist</p>
<p>in the future thousands and thousands of years from now</p>
<p>what are we</p>
<p>gonna keep piling up</p>
<p>these fucking toxic rods</p>
<p>until we have one part of the glow</p>
<p>where you couldn&rsquo;t even fly over it in a</p>
<p>plane or your fucking</p>
<p>plane will melt and everyone will die of cancer</p>
<p>the fuck are you gonna do</p>
<p>how are you gonna</p>
<p>store all that shit</p>
<p>i mean this</p>
<p>thing in sweden i</p>
<p>think it is</p>
<p>where they have a</p>
<p>tunnel that</p>
<p>goes deep into the</p>
<p>earth in this</p>
<p>vault they created that&rsquo;ll last 100 000 years</p>
<p>just to keep</p>
<p>these fucking</p>
<p>things in it</p>
<p>geez that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>ridiculous i mean the idea of</p>
<p>splitting atoms to</p>
<p>light homes though and harnessing it and</p>
<p>their man think that we can control</p>
<p>splitting atoms</p>
<p>like oh but what&rsquo;s the options you look at the grid</p>
<p>look at like</p>
<p>fly over la and look at the size of that fucking grid</p>
<p>look at all those</p>
<p>goddamn lights</p>
<p>look at all those</p>
<p>houses like a circuit</p>
<p>board it&rsquo;s insane how big it is don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>you think it</p>
<p>should be mandatory solar</p>
<p>collector roofs or something like that it should be</p>
<p>something for</p>
<p>california 100 man</p>
<p>for well it&rsquo;s the problem is it&rsquo;s really expensive you</p>
<p>know people can barely afford to put gas in</p>
<p>their tank right now</p>
<p>i mean now gas is 420 for regular</p>
<p>i saw that yesterday i was like what the fuck is that</p>
<p>420 for regular i mean that&rsquo;s incredible i</p>
<p>spent 90 bucks filling my tank the other day</p>
<p>dude that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>wrong really</p>
<p>what do you</p>
<p>drive you know</p>
<p>these fucking</p>
<p>cunts that we have run in this country man there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>a there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>story that matt taibi</p>
<p>wrote for rolling</p>
<p>stone about the</p>
<p>i put it on my twitter</p>
<p>earlier today because somebody</p>
<p>retweeted it</p>
<p>or somebody sent it to me and i retweeted it and it is</p>
<p>mind boggling and it&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>about the wives of bankers</p>
<p>getting these</p>
<p>the rolling</p>
<p>stone article is called the real</p>
<p>housewives of wall street</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s about</p>
<p>these wives of</p>
<p>these fucking bankers getting these</p>
<p>250 million dollar loans</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s incredible</p>
<p>this story will make your fucking blood boil</p>
<p>they tapped into the</p>
<p>money that was</p>
<p>supposed to be</p>
<p>for the bailout</p>
<p>and the bailout provided a</p>
<p>bunch of different loan options</p>
<p>and it was basically</p>
<p>to re stimulate the economy</p>
<p>fucking multi</p>
<p>multi multi millionaire bankers saw this opening in the</p>
<p>system and capitalized</p>
<p>on it oh my god dude it&rsquo;s terrifying</p>
<p>and the way</p>
<p>these these</p>
<p>these bonds and</p>
<p>these these</p>
<p>things work is they they buy up</p>
<p>sketchy bonds</p>
<p>and if the bonds fail if</p>
<p>everything fails</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t have to pay the</p>
<p>money back but</p>
<p>if they profit they make</p>
<p>money off of it</p>
<p>the whole thing it&rsquo;s mind boggling</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s crazy people</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so scary</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s crazy i mean</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not admiral it&rsquo;s almost</p>
<p>crazy how you see</p>
<p>the second something</p>
<p>comes somebody finds a way to exploit it</p>
<p>i mean somebody finds some loophole in there</p>
<p>and shame on</p>
<p>obama&rsquo;s entire administration ambushes all</p>
<p>these court not</p>
<p>for not putting some literature</p>
<p>in that document saying that you cannot you know</p>
<p>no no profit</p>
<p>should be made off</p>
<p>this you know from the bankers are the bankers wives</p>
<p>250 million well</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s one</p>
<p>thing but how</p>
<p>about there</p>
<p>should be no fucking the</p>
<p>that the bailout is the way they&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>structured is</p>
<p>completely insane it&rsquo;s like free money</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no accountability no</p>
<p>accountability</p>
<p>account account for the</p>
<p>money we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not getting receipts either when it&rsquo;s not like</p>
<p>the united states</p>
<p>citizens who paid the</p>
<p>taxes towards this</p>
<p>get to review where the</p>
<p>money went so there&rsquo;s like an account of it so you can</p>
<p>watch and track it</p>
<p>right no you can&rsquo;t man they don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>where the fuck it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going the whole</p>
<p>thing is complete utter</p>
<p>chaos and it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>completely out of line</p>
<p>these people are getting</p>
<p>giant bonuses man</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re their banks failed and they got bonuses</p>
<p>they get the rich get richer and the</p>
<p>money comes directly from the taxpayer there is no</p>
<p>money the bank has failed they don&rsquo;t have any</p>
<p>money so they get an infusion of</p>
<p>money from the</p>
<p>federal government and then they have to pay</p>
<p>these guys money these guys</p>
<p>millions and millions of dollars and it&rsquo;s amazing that</p>
<p>obama gets away with this</p>
<p>that all of them get away with this</p>
<p>you are supposed</p>
<p>to be the fucking president you asshole</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re supposed to be protecting people from this shit</p>
<p>this is not supposed to have ever happened</p>
<p>and when this does happen</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re the one who&rsquo;s supposed to be us</p>
<p>the one is supposed to step it</p>
<p>and say what</p>
<p>the fuck man you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>obama you&rsquo;re 46 years old man</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re only a few years</p>
<p>older than me yeah you&rsquo;re a few</p>
<p>years older than me you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re my friend</p>
<p>right and you&rsquo;re in there with</p>
<p>these fucking cunts you&rsquo;re not saying shit</p>
<p>yeah you letting these guys</p>
<p>steal money</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re letting them</p>
<p>steal billions</p>
<p>across the economy</p>
<p>and continue to do business as</p>
<p>usual and the banks get bigger and bigger</p>
<p>because they fucking buy up</p>
<p>these other failing banks</p>
<p>and then they become even more</p>
<p>untouchable and american cities with dk like detroit</p>
<p>and what they helps you get in</p>
<p>power so that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s up like</p>
<p>where is his name</p>
<p>are you gonna</p>
<p>when you get out are you</p>
<p>gonna tell us what&rsquo;s up</p>
<p>what happens then is he</p>
<p>gonna get maybe he loses this year newt gingrich wins</p>
<p>and he tells us exactly how the fucking</p>
<p>world works yeah</p>
<p>you know is that</p>
<p>gonna happen</p>
<p>please well i&rsquo;m sure he got in and just like any</p>
<p>other aspiring</p>
<p>man of anybody running for president i don&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>since kennedy</p>
<p>or someone like that who&rsquo;s really in it for</p>
<p>you know political reasons and even</p>
<p>kennedy was</p>
<p>grooming for it</p>
<p>you know he was</p>
<p>groomed for he was of the pedigree</p>
<p>but the thing is like</p>
<p>now it&rsquo;s a corporate it&rsquo;s a ceo</p>
<p>job you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re the top of the company now you&rsquo;re not like you</p>
<p>said a man of the people for the people by the people</p>
<p>and he might have gone into that</p>
<p>thing thinking he could be</p>
<p>but once you</p>
<p>sit down they sit you in that room look boy you&rsquo;re the</p>
<p>puppet do you</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s true though</p>
<p>or do you think it&rsquo;s just all bullshit i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think he has any</p>
<p>power and i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s any</p>
<p>worse than it&rsquo;s ever been ever</p>
<p>i think i think everybody</p>
<p>it gets up in arms it&rsquo;s like look at nixon look at all</p>
<p>those guys everybody was</p>
<p>how could you not be president and</p>
<p>start to develop some</p>
<p>grandiose ideas yeah but dude you gotta</p>
<p>financially</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s never been this way</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s never been</p>
<p>with the deregulation that was passed during the</p>
<p>reagan administration and continued all through clinton</p>
<p>and bush and all this</p>
<p>that has allowed</p>
<p>these financial institutions to</p>
<p>get into a position that we&rsquo;re supposed to be protected</p>
<p>from after the</p>
<p>great depression</p>
<p>after the great</p>
<p>depression they put all sorts of laws in place</p>
<p>so that banks couldn&rsquo;t get</p>
<p>risky with your</p>
<p>money and do</p>
<p>crazy shit and then wind up losing</p>
<p>everything right</p>
<p>which they did to us they got rid of all that shit they</p>
<p>get rid of all that shit and then unchecked growth and</p>
<p>spending came because of that and</p>
<p>these guys these</p>
<p>motherfuckers</p>
<p>took all kinds of</p>
<p>crazy chances with people&rsquo;s money</p>
<p>and then it all fell</p>
<p>apart and then banks collapsed and people lost</p>
<p>their life savings what&rsquo;s happening too like</p>
<p>you look now the cell</p>
<p>phone companies are narrowing down to two there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>virtually two banks anymore that&rsquo;s not that bad though</p>
<p>no one&rsquo;s getting ripped off</p>
<p>this financial institution</p>
<p>thing what happened with the market</p>
<p>is a goddamn</p>
<p>heist it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>giant heist</p>
<p>people made millions of dollars in</p>
<p>front of everyone&rsquo;s face</p>
<p>after the banks failed and</p>
<p>obama didn&rsquo;t do a damn</p>
<p>thing it&rsquo;s a heist</p>
<p>and it went on</p>
<p>he knows it</p>
<p>it went on in</p>
<p>the 80s too the lincoln savings and loan scandal</p>
<p>but not like this this is the</p>
<p>biggest one by far ever that&rsquo;s ever been perpetrated by</p>
<p>these people</p>
<p>the whole thing is</p>
<p>fraudulent the whole</p>
<p>thing is a scam</p>
<p>from the very beginning</p>
<p>they knew everything was</p>
<p>illegitimate they knew what they were doing was</p>
<p>wrong they were trying to offering clients</p>
<p>like stocks that they knew that they were betting</p>
<p>against they were betting</p>
<p>against these</p>
<p>stocks yet they were offering up to</p>
<p>their clients</p>
<p>the whole thing is sickening man it&rsquo;s sickening and</p>
<p>obama ain&rsquo;t doing shit</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s not saying</p>
<p>anything he&rsquo;s not doing anything he&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>freaking out yeah</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s sickening i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think he can&rsquo;t i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think he will</p>
<p>i mean he doesn&rsquo;t want to lose his job he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna and all</p>
<p>those people</p>
<p>you know they help you get</p>
<p>elected i know but being to do what</p>
<p>what are you</p>
<p>gonna do you are you hold are you holding</p>
<p>the barbarians back at the gate i mean</p>
<p>is there so many</p>
<p>spears and swords coming through that</p>
<p>gate you&rsquo;re just barely keeping us</p>
<p>alive i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think he&rsquo;s doing that i</p>
<p>think you are</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s the idea</p>
<p>of being president to get your presidential library</p>
<p>built whether you</p>
<p>serve for eight years</p>
<p>and to sell your book and to get your deal</p>
<p>you know and to say that you did that in politics</p>
<p>because i bet</p>
<p>you george w bush is having a dandy old life now</p>
<p>and a good old time hey</p>
<p>brian people get real distracted when you start</p>
<p>wandering off when we&rsquo;re having conversations</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m actually</p>
<p>just trying to fix the lag that everyone&rsquo;s talking</p>
<p>about right now i can&rsquo;t fix lag</p>
<p>ustream is just being itself</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just not that</p>
<p>spectacular</p>
<p>yeah i did catch</p>
<p>the charlie sheen</p>
<p>ustream but</p>
<p>it wasn&rsquo;t the</p>
<p>first one was</p>
<p>ridiculously bad</p>
<p>we had like all</p>
<p>those cronies</p>
<p>you realize wow this is why that guy&rsquo;s simon</p>
<p>rex i hadn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>heard that name</p>
<p>since 1996 who is it one of the</p>
<p>dudes who was hanging out with charlie sheen in that</p>
<p>first u stream set</p>
<p>the guy from duran duran he</p>
<p>was not he was a</p>
<p>tvvj and there</p>
<p>was some scandal happen i can&rsquo;t remember what something</p>
<p>put the kibosh on his fledgling career really</p>
<p>yeah something</p>
<p>come on porn man i</p>
<p>think it involved porn</p>
<p>or something</p>
<p>porn man porn man</p>
<p>porn man sure you like the</p>
<p>naked nickelodeon</p>
<p>simon rex i don&rsquo;t remember him</p>
<p>so he was one of the ones that</p>
<p>was there so he was one of the hangers on and then you</p>
<p>could tell like the</p>
<p>other dude looked like some out of work jazz</p>
<p>musician it&rsquo;s like you can tell like</p>
<p>now dude was geeking</p>
<p>off of drugs and i don&rsquo;t know he was on him but i</p>
<p>think he was geeking off of him</p>
<p>and his judgment was</p>
<p>super suspect that</p>
<p>not already so</p>
<p>i think he was also</p>
<p>swimming in all the love that he was getting from all</p>
<p>these people winning was all over</p>
<p>he had over a million followers almost instantly</p>
<p>and i think he&rsquo;s like i&rsquo;m the fucking shit</p>
<p>people i told you</p>
<p>these fucking</p>
<p>trolls they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna wish they didn&rsquo;t get rid of me you know</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll you know i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna have a</p>
<p>the public will</p>
<p>demand that i come back yeah</p>
<p>but man you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going out there on some fucking thin branches son</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very hard for a guy like him</p>
<p>to take that howard beal</p>
<p>kind of zeal</p>
<p>that he was taking because at the end of the day is</p>
<p>you know howard bill had a lot to say whereas</p>
<p>charlie sheen has a lot of bumper</p>
<p>stickers a lot of</p>
<p>catchphrases and that&rsquo;s fine</p>
<p>but as you&rsquo;re seeing as you go out there this thing&rsquo;s</p>
<p>petering on</p>
<p>fumes now and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>starting to realize out baldwin did an</p>
<p>op ed piece i</p>
<p>think like in the huffpost or something a</p>
<p>direct letter to him</p>
<p>being like quit being a douchebag</p>
<p>alex baldwin yeah</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s like here&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>thing you&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>against douchebags and you&rsquo;re acting like one you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna lose don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>fight the network just apologize go back</p>
<p>and i was like well</p>
<p>apparently alec baldwin</p>
<p>said he acted like charlie sheen during the</p>
<p>hunt for red</p>
<p>october it was supposed to be a</p>
<p>whole bunch of</p>
<p>movies for him</p>
<p>and he didn&rsquo;t get him because</p>
<p>he was getting all like that too like bigger than the</p>
<p>production oh really</p>
<p>you know at the end of the day</p>
<p>if this thing turned out to be a hoax</p>

<p>was completely horrible for that dude</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s been</p>
<p>way better movies with better cgi oh i</p>
<p>think i saw your</p>
<p>tweet when you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>about to get into it some wine some weed and</p>
<p>tron yeah yeah i didn&rsquo;t see the afters</p>
<p>simon rex in 1993 at</p>
<p>age 19 appeared solo</p>

<p>three masturbation porn films</p>
<p>arrival oh that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>where and it came</p>
<p>to surface after he</p>
<p>started to get a name for himself yeah</p>

<p>well this guy</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know what he does with him i don&rsquo;t know if</p>
<p>he raps what does he do does he do that i don&rsquo;t know if</p>
<p>he goes on the road with him i just remember he was on</p>
<p>the verge of</p>
<p>the song the song&rsquo;s hilarious that</p>
<p>would you know and have the</p>
<p>video playing in the</p>
<p>background and that</p>
<p>would keep the</p>
<p>crowd from yeah</p>
<p>maybe they could</p>
<p>close with it yeah i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just i don&rsquo;t know he was in new york</p>
<p>this week this weekend right i</p>
<p>heard he did charlie sheen yeah he was in new york</p>
<p>the charlie sheen report yeah</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re following him like</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s fucking bigfoot</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s working seen in new york</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s working</p>
<p>his whole mission</p>
<p>yeah sort of</p>
<p>i mean he&rsquo;s doing something city to</p>
<p>city it seems to be getting different reviews but this</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t new this</p>
<p>is now a lot of celebrities are doing this</p>
<p>thing going on on tour and not being comedians</p>
<p>who else who else is doing that</p>
<p>or have little</p>
<p>experience in comedy steve oh</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s selling out</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s doing a</p>
<p>stand up though</p>
<p>right he&rsquo;s created that but the</p>
<p>thing is i like him</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m friends</p>
<p>with him and that guy is actually taking the time</p>
<p>to he really likes comedy and wants to</p>
<p>do it whereas</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s just been</p>
<p>given a lot</p>
<p>early on because he&rsquo;s already</p>
<p>famous you know</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s headlining clubs</p>
<p>but i think he&rsquo;s finding that&rsquo;s hard</p>
<p>the way to fill it yeah that&rsquo;s real hard to get thrown</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s how charlie murphy did it</p>
<p>charlie murphy was</p>
<p>famous and then he was headlining yeah you hit the boom</p>
<p>you hit it hard because you&rsquo;re realizing being</p>
<p>famous doesn&rsquo;t supplement</p>
<p>no experience dude</p>
<p>being an open micer in</p>
<p>front of a giant</p>
<p>group of people that was paid to see you holy</p>
<p>shit that&rsquo;s too much to</p>
<p>say yeah fuck yeah it is</p>
<p>but you know it&rsquo;s charlie&rsquo;s fault for</p>
<p>just diving in there</p>
<p>and wanting to be a headliner</p>
<p>i saw that clip of him</p>
<p>walking off the</p>
<p>stage tearing up the</p>
<p>check walking up well</p>
<p>fuck y&rsquo;all walking away</p>
<p>i see things like that</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m like you know i see like some just you know the</p>
<p>thing like with</p>
<p>kirk and all that but then i see guys</p>
<p>like bill burr who take an audience and turn it around</p>
<p>well that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>skill veteran</p>
<p>yeah and i can&rsquo;t say anybody like</p>
<p>should be that good but the</p>
<p>thing is it&rsquo;s like a real</p>
<p>skill would be</p>
<p>to now get them back on your side you know</p>
<p>yeah man yeah i know what you&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about i mean</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s the hardest</p>
<p>thing in the</p>
<p>world and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna go to detroit</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s already</p>
<p>tough times there and they took your</p>
<p>money that&rsquo;s why then you got</p>
<p>no show for them yeah you&rsquo;re just kind of like taking</p>
<p>their they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>gonna take that shit</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s like this is</p>
<p>experiment you know like i</p>
<p>understand it&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>experiment but when you&rsquo;re fucking selling out giants</p>
<p>auditoriums like that</p>
<p>like you you</p>
<p>gotta really you</p>
<p>gotta fuck her saying</p>
<p>so where does he go with this though</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t think he can keep doing it i</p>
<p>think eventually people are</p>
<p>gonna like wear thin of it and he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna wear thin of it too like he wanted to be</p>
<p>loved and all</p>
<p>sudden half the</p>
<p>places where he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going he&rsquo;s getting booed</p>
<p>and people are shitting on him and</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s got the</p>
<p>world&rsquo;s attention and nothing to say</p>
<p>yeah and this is</p>
<p>not i mean even if he does have something to say like</p>
<p>he did this one</p>
<p>weird video</p>
<p>where he talked into the camera and</p>
<p>all this shit that he</p>
<p>wrote it was like really like produced</p>
<p>and written and that</p>
<p>speech kind of gave losing duh</p>
<p>moving on you know he was talking like</p>
<p>like hunter</p>
<p>s thompson yeah</p>
<p>you know exactly</p>
<p>here exactly and he was like it</p>
<p>was he was doing like</p>
<p>yeah i mean he even said</p>
<p>he was like</p>
<p>he held up his fucking</p>
<p>is you know the</p>
<p>ticket for this</p>
<p>thing was talking</p>
<p>about the ticket he was doing like a</p>
<p>marshall for it</p>
<p>buy the ticket</p>
<p>take the ride</p>
<p>and like use the hunter</p>
<p>s thompson line yeah</p>
<p>the whole idea</p>
<p>behind it is very strange this guy who&rsquo;s this</p>
<p>huge huge multi</p>
<p>millionaire</p>
<p>super celebrity</p>
<p>and we are fascinated with him losing his job</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s trying</p>
<p>to like campaign to get his job back and we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>paying money to see him talk right</p>
<p>i heard it best describe a lady said i read an</p>
<p>article it said</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re so fascinated</p>
<p>with charlie sheen because a guy how can a guy</p>
<p>who has so much more than us have so much less than us</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>great way of putting the best summation of that guy he</p>
<p>does it&rsquo;s like you know he&rsquo;s loaded but he&rsquo;s not he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>got no marbles you know i&rsquo;ll keep my marbles</p>
<p>that dude&rsquo;s gone</p>
<p>and not good gone</p>
<p>marketable gone like i said</p>
<p>now you&rsquo;re trying to go the folk hero</p>
<p>route you&rsquo;re trying to go the conan o&rsquo;brien</p>
<p>route but conan o&rsquo;brien&rsquo;s beloved</p>
<p>because he put that</p>
<p>much work into being beloved you know what i mean yeah</p>
<p>but when he here&rsquo;s a perfect example</p>
<p>when he did his show</p>
<p>right he would go on the road he had of he had a</p>
<p>fucking show</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>entertainer and the</p>
<p>thing is it&rsquo;s like now</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s big enough he can go straight</p>
<p>to the people and say you know what fuck the network</p>
<p>people love me sure but i&rsquo;ve been doing this since 93</p>
<p>every single fucking night</p>
<p>right you know charlie sheen just</p>
<p>started this it&rsquo;s like you know</p>
<p>good luck with that i</p>
<p>think he fizzles out</p>
<p>if what&rsquo;s his</p>
<p>name wanted to if conan o&rsquo;brien wanted to he could do</p>
<p>arenas all over the country</p>
<p>and he would do like he</p>
<p>would be in detroit one</p>
<p>night and do a show</p>
<p>with no television whatsoever</p>
<p>yeah and higher</p>
<p>comics and higher</p>
<p>you know have</p>
<p>people come on have</p>
<p>musicians play</p>
<p>and do the conan o&rsquo;brien</p>
<p>show like i say a 90</p>
<p>minute show and he</p>
<p>could do it all over the country and make fucking</p>
<p>ridiculous amounts and talk</p>
<p>about a guy who had real grievances with the network</p>
<p>you know what i mean and</p>
<p>never really aired them in a distasteful way</p>
<p>yeah while that</p>
<p>whole thing is so hard to fucking really figure out</p>
<p>because jay</p>
<p>leno they kept wanting to get rid of jay</p>
<p>leno and jay</p>
<p>leno was number one</p>
<p>yeah why would they want to get rid of them the</p>
<p>whole thing</p>
<p>was really ass handed</p>
<p>the way they did it was so dumb</p>
<p>and really conan o&rsquo;brien</p>
<p>was better in the</p>
<p>later night i thought so too but they</p>
<p>should have</p>
<p>done i mean everybody wants the tonight show</p>
<p>but i&rsquo;ll tell you what the conan o&rsquo;brien</p>
<p>show was his fucking show man</p>
<p>it was his show it was his</p>
<p>there was a</p>
<p>whole culture behind it and the</p>
<p>thing is that&rsquo;s like the tonight</p>
<p>show you almost need to be a lot more</p>
<p>generic like jay</p>
<p>leno to appeal to the masses</p>
<p>but there was</p>
<p>this is our</p>
<p>thing when you</p>
<p>watch conan late night</p>
<p>when i see someone wanting to leave</p>
<p>their job and go to another job you know that&rsquo;s an</p>
<p>early i mean i get the fact that more people are</p>
<p>gonna be watching</p>
<p>earlier i get that but</p>
<p>what it says</p>
<p>to me is that guy didn&rsquo;t get enough respect</p>
<p>he didn&rsquo;t get enough appreciation from the network</p>
<p>they weren&rsquo;t</p>
<p>behind him enough</p>
<p>in his eyes</p>
<p>he didn&rsquo;t feel equal</p>
<p>you know he wanted that</p>
<p>other job that</p>
<p>other jobs the big job</p>
<p>i want the big job right what</p>
<p>about that big job</p>
<p>you know what you mean you&rsquo;re fucking conan o&rsquo;brien</p>
<p>man what difference does it make</p>
<p>if your show&rsquo;s on a ten or if it&rsquo;s on an eleven yeah</p>
<p>conan o&rsquo;brien especially</p>
<p>tebow days yeah even</p>
<p>watches tv live exactly</p>
<p>i mean yeah you&rsquo;re not some people are</p>
<p>gonna miss it because they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna go to bed</p>
<p>early so fucking what</p>
<p>plenty of people are</p>
<p>gonna watch it</p>
<p>right yeah just just be you just spew at 11</p>
<p>apparently over at</p>
<p>tbs they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>like if he gets ratings like this he&rsquo;ll stay on forever</p>
<p>life and at</p>
<p>tbs you get two million ratings</p>
<p>or two million viewers you&rsquo;re fucking hit</p>
<p>but i went from being a big</p>
<p>conan fan to</p>
<p>having i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>watched it once on tvs i</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t watched it i didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>watch it when he did the tonight show i</p>
<p>haven&rsquo;t watched</p>
<p>since he left new york</p>
<p>yeah not that i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>against them it&rsquo;s just that routine is gone yeah is it</p>
<p>better now is it worse</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t think so</p>
<p>i think the reason why i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>watch is because the late</p>
<p>night shows what i liked i liked that extra</p>
<p>masturbating bear</p>
<p>the writers were all</p>
<p>funny on that show</p>
<p>they&rsquo;d come out and do sketch it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>the same writers</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t see</p>
<p>those two guys he used to use</p>
<p>these two guys</p>
<p>all the time the preparation h raymond guy</p>
<p>who would come out hand out</p>
<p>for braces still around is he</p>
<p>yeah he kind of looks like ryan o&rsquo;neal the comedian</p>
<p>and then there was another one with the</p>
<p>curly like simon and garfunkel fro</p>
<p>yeah i think they&rsquo;re both</p>
<p>still around</p>
<p>those guys were</p>
<p>like almost funnier than conan to me but there was that</p>
<p>whole new york vibe that it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>it just is missing to me but i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>you think the</p>
<p>vibe is different because it&rsquo;s in los angeles it</p>
<p>might be but the</p>
<p>thing is i can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>speak intelligently</p>
<p>about it cause i don&rsquo;t watch it</p>
<p>i watched conan</p>
<p>from 93 to 2003</p>
<p>mostly cause at</p>
<p>first i was a</p>
<p>teenager and then i</p>
<p>lived in hollywood i didn&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>cable at the time</p>
<p>it was something to fall asleep to</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s definitely</p>
<p>a different</p>
<p>funny vibe on the east</p>
<p>coast than there is on the west</p>
<p>coast i find even my sets are different on the east</p>
<p>coast and there on the west</p>
<p>coast i find i have to explain less on the east</p>
<p>coast and i can go off into more obscure</p>
<p>references and not in the way like</p>
<p>super obscure but in the way that</p>
<p>everybody&rsquo;s following</p>
<p>along and i don&rsquo;t have to make sure somebody needs to</p>
<p>catch up you know yeah</p>
<p>i think i mean there&rsquo;s intelligent people</p>
<p>everywhere but there&rsquo;s more of them in the east</p>
<p>coast sure i mean that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>where all our</p>
<p>finest institutions are you know it&rsquo;s no accident</p>
<p>that all our best colleges are on the east</p>
<p>coast our finest institutions</p>
<p>ah yes harvard</p>
<p>so you should have a</p>
<p>cigar in your hand when you say that yeah i did</p>
<p>sound like a real ass</p>
<p>woman ascot as well all of our finest institutions</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve been really addicted to camel too lately i think</p>
<p>when the conan left i</p>
<p>started watching camel</p>
<p>and now i&rsquo;m like</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know once you go camel you</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t really go yeah this is a fun show he&rsquo;s got a fun</p>
<p>zoo of a show too yeah i did that show and i was the</p>
<p>second comedian on there and i</p>
<p>oh right i had</p>
<p>heard like nightmare stories when they first</p>
<p>started how hard it was like the</p>
<p>stage was cat</p>
<p>according to</p>
<p>the audience it was new nobody knew who he was</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re like you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna go out there and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna die kid bobcat goldberg was the director</p>
<p>at the time and i was like oh man oh this is</p>
<p>scary and i went out</p>
<p>and it went really good</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s like man you&rsquo;re the best</p>
<p>comic we&rsquo;ve had on i&rsquo;m like how many you</p>
<p>had on he&rsquo;s like one</p>
<p>i was like ah well</p>
<p>who was the</p>
<p>other comic yeah</p>
<p>and i don&rsquo;t even remember who the</p>
<p>other comic was but i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think it was anybody</p>
<p>because i wasn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>anybody so that&rsquo;s who they were picking out at the time</p>
<p>i think dave rast saw me at the improv</p>
<p>on a wednesday</p>
<p>night doing the open mic i was</p>
<p>twenty three he&rsquo;s like hey we you wanna you</p>
<p>wanna do the</p>
<p>jimmy kimmel show tonight i&rsquo;m like i</p>
<p>guess sure what&rsquo;s that</p>
<p>wow and then shit</p>
<p>and he got me</p>
<p>on so wherever dave wrath is i forever owe him my first</p>
<p>tv break yes</p>
<p>david dave wrath&rsquo;s good man he&rsquo;s a very good guy</p>
<p>very good guy he&rsquo;s one of</p>
<p>those guys that&rsquo;s been around forever</p>
<p>the comedy business is such a</p>
<p>weird fucking business isn&rsquo;t it and we were talking</p>
<p>about sleazy</p>
<p>agents and managers and</p>
<p>you know we&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about what it&rsquo;s like to have one that sucks and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s weird you know it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>weird thing to</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like in</p>
<p>this business it&rsquo;s like you can have all this</p>
<p>drive but you have to it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>almost like being in a band you need somebody else to</p>
<p>champion that</p>
<p>drive as well</p>
<p>like i love</p>
<p>music but i</p>
<p>never wanted to be in a band because</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t want to have to rely on the lazy bass player</p>
<p>or the coked</p>
<p>head drummer</p>
<p>you know it&rsquo;s like i want this</p>
<p>thing to happen and</p>
<p>you know when you</p>
<p>got a team working for you like that and they&rsquo;re not on</p>
<p>board you&rsquo;re like son of a</p>
<p>bitch yeah that&rsquo;s a reoccurring theme</p>
<p>with comics you</p>
<p>gotta make sure</p>
<p>you got a manager that knows what the fuck is going on</p>
<p>and if you get a bad one you get some</p>
<p>idiot you get attached to one i have a</p>
<p>bunch of friends</p>
<p>that started out with one manager</p>
<p>and then somewhere</p>
<p>along the line</p>
<p>you know this</p>
<p>manager when some critical decision was to be made this</p>
<p>manager fucked up and they got rid of them and they</p>
<p>moved on and got some bigger manager</p>
<p>and then they got sued and a</p>
<p>bunch of stupid</p>
<p>shit happened you</p>
<p>start off with one guy and that guy turns out to suck</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re attached to that fucking idiot</p>
<p>right and he feels like he deserves</p>
<p>a percentage of your profits then it becomes like a</p>
<p>marriage and a</p>
<p>sword then you have to</p>
<p>break up with this person exactly</p>
<p>just such a nightmare like i had been</p>
<p>my manager six years and i had to</p>
<p>break up and she was very</p>
<p>receptive and</p>
<p>understanding about it</p>
<p>you know and that made me</p>
<p>think in my mind like oh man this</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t go as bad as i thought it would</p>
<p>and then you</p>
<p>start thinking i</p>
<p>should have done it sooner</p>
<p>and all that but it&rsquo;s just like</p>
<p>you know whatever happens happens but you can&rsquo;t stay</p>
<p>with somebody who</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t have your best interest</p>
<p>in your heart you know</p>
<p>is that usually</p>
<p>because they have a better client now yeah</p>
<p>they have a</p>
<p>better client</p>
<p>bigger fish</p>
<p>to fry you know i get it in this town that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>truth my agent</p>
<p>represents like</p>
<p>jamie foxx and all</p>
<p>these people if</p>
<p>they turn it down</p>
<p>then maybe i&rsquo;ll get an audition</p>
<p>they want to make sure that you&rsquo;re a real</p>
<p>money maker before they put any interest</p>
<p>and time into you and you got to go out and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost like they have you in the</p>
<p>stable and then you got to go out and make</p>
<p>your own shit happen yeah call us and we&rsquo;ll take the 10</p>
<p>when you booked up</p>
<p>yeah and then they go okay now let&rsquo;s make you bigger</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s like getting christmas presents from shoes</p>
<p>i mean the best</p>
<p>thing they can do is just get you in</p>
<p>front of someone</p>
<p>where you can perform yeah</p>
<p>especially if you&rsquo;re out there trying to do the acting</p>
<p>thing man what a</p>
<p>crazy job that is</p>
<p>gonna go in some fucking room and pretend</p>
<p>that this guy that you&rsquo;re sitting there with a</p>
<p>piece of paper in his hand</p>
<p>pretend that this is your brother</p>
<p>and you guys are</p>
<p>back at home and</p>
<p>dad just got back from the war and he&rsquo;s a little shell</p>
<p>shocked really</p>

<p>technique you know the real like</p>
<p>method kind of</p>
<p>stuff and his</p>
<p>whole goal was to make you cry</p>
<p>and then he</p>
<p>would be like what happened if your</p>
<p>mother got killed in a car accident oh jesus</p>
<p>christ that&rsquo;s some</p>
<p>awful shit to say dude like i&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>gonna cry i&rsquo;m getting pissed at you actually for</p>
<p>thinking that you need fucked up people for actors</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>have actors you want to have really good ones</p>
<p>those people</p>
<p>better be fucked up most of them there&rsquo;s a few of them</p>
<p>that aren&rsquo;t fucked up that are really good actors but</p>
<p>mostly few and far between</p>
<p>most of them are a mess</p>

<p>of a boxer in a</p>
<p>movie where he looks</p>
<p>he looks like a real boxer</p>
<p>not some bullshit</p>
<p>like sylvester</p>

<p>blood he was</p>
<p>absolutely loony</p>
<p>to get the fuck out of here who can do that oh</p>

<p>those guys russell</p>

<p>stupid little helmet</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s smoking a cigarette</p>
<p>he is fat as fuck that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>funny like he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>just gigantic fat it&rsquo;s been a couple of years</p>
<p>since he has</p>
<p>had a picture else since</p>
<p>fat when he did</p>
<p>robin hood man he had a cut weight to make</p>
<p>robin hood too</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t have</p>
<p>robin hood as a fat guy but he&rsquo;s one of</p>
<p>those can&rsquo;t hard</p>
<p>drinking hard smoking actor dudes</p>
<p>yeah he&rsquo;s a wild man yeah</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s crazy fucker that&rsquo;s why he&rsquo;s so good</p>
<p>i watched a beautiful mind on the way to australia</p>
<p>out of respect because i was</p>
<p>going to australia anyway</p>
<p>and it was on the</p>
<p>plane it was one of</p>
<p>those options</p>
<p>forgot how fucking good that</p>
<p>movie was was that</p>
<p>2000 best picture</p>
<p>2001 i think best picture</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know but it was fucking good yeah</p>
<p>cause gladiator won</p>
<p>2000 and then that one won 2001 he was</p>
<p>cleaning up at that time you know i</p>
<p>watched the</p>
<p>other day that i forgot how fucking good it was</p>
<p>contact oh yeah</p>
<p>i watched that recently on netflix</p>
<p>dude i put it on twitter and all</p>
<p>these people going</p>
<p>hello you contact</p>
<p>sucks contact&rsquo;s awesome you&rsquo;re gay</p>
<p>you are gay yeah you&rsquo;re gay you are you&rsquo;re gay</p>
<p>the letter u the letter r gay</p>
<p>hello you&rsquo;re gay contact sucks</p>
<p>no it&rsquo;s context</p>
<p>great i watched that recently</p>
<p>i love that</p>
<p>you know what you know it&rsquo;s a horrible</p>
<p>movie but almost</p>
<p>in that same idea it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>again with dennis</p>
<p>quaid hi guys</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s got the cb</p>
<p>radio and he&rsquo;s talking to the past</p>
<p>oh you know what you&rsquo;re talking about yeah</p>
<p>jim caviezel</p>
<p>yes son yeah</p>
<p>this is like</p>
<p>one word like what happened to that guy played fucking</p>
<p>jesus christ</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s gone and then he&rsquo;s gone</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t even make</p>
<p>sense i mean that guy</p>
<p>should have been gigantor</p>
<p>that movie was a huge</p>
<p>movie it was huge but it was one of</p>
<p>those movies i</p>
<p>think where the</p>
<p>movie was huger than who was in it</p>
<p>and here&rsquo;s another issue</p>
<p>the movie was very anti semitic</p>
<p>very anti semitic i mean</p>
<p>that was argued</p>
<p>whether or not that was historically accurate or</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>whatever the fuck it is you don&rsquo;t know you</p>
<p>weren&rsquo;t there</p>
<p>and the way it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>depicted it&rsquo;s depicted to me like the jews were like a</p>
<p>huge problem</p>
<p>which is i don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>me look the</p>
<p>whole thing i</p>
<p>think is fiction</p>
<p>in the first</p>
<p>place i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>it just seems to me that the</p>
<p>whole story so</p>
<p>convoluted and</p>
<p>even if there was a man named</p>
<p>jesus who knows what the fuck really went down i just</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t get why people will buy that and then not buy</p>
<p>other things it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>no world&rsquo;s not</p>
<p>getting warmer no way no no global warming here</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>story of this guy who came back from the dead it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>where are you</p>
<p>where are your</p>
<p>priorities yeah</p>
<p>you know but</p>
<p>jim cavizo playing him was really strange because you</p>
<p>know he got really obsessed with it because he was 33</p>
<p>at the time and</p>
<p>jesus was 33 and</p>
<p>his name was jc yeah</p>
<p>and you know i mean how</p>
<p>funny is it this movie</p>
<p>this incredibly religious</p>
<p>movie that made incredible amounts of money</p>
<p>was made by a</p>
<p>psychopath yeah</p>
<p>an absolute</p>
<p>now that you look at it</p>
<p>in the past and you look at who he is now and you hear</p>
<p>those tapes</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s you should just shut up</p>
<p>and blow me</p>
<p>just insane</p>
<p>red eyed spider</p>
<p>bit flying out of his fucking</p>
<p>mouth i mean</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s off the deep end</p>
<p>crazy and he made the most</p>
<p>successful religious</p>
<p>movie of all time</p>
<p>privately funded it himself</p>
<p>and then had to turn that profit too yeah</p>
<p>and built some</p>
<p>incredible amounts of</p>
<p>money because of it</p>
<p>you know you</p>
<p>never saw passion the christ</p>
<p>never saw any</p>
<p>of this i did</p>
<p>actually have a bit</p>
<p>about it that it was a two hour</p>
<p>movie about a dude with</p>
<p>magic who got his ass kicked</p>
<p>and i go that is the last</p>
<p>movie with subtitles i&rsquo;ll ever see without kung</p>
<p>fu in it yeah</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t that</p>
<p>an aramaic or something like i remember that one yeah</p>
<p>people were coming out of theaters all</p>
<p>moved and crying</p>
<p>yeah i don&rsquo;t know what the language was it</p>
<p>might have been</p>
<p>aramaic i think that&rsquo;s what they</p>
<p>spoke at the time</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what they</p>
<p>spoke and then</p>
<p>they offered up to subtitles but felon was</p>
<p>subtitles yeah</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m like you it&rsquo;s either kung</p>
<p>fu or some swedish</p>
<p>weird film where people are</p>
<p>gonna get killed yeah or some japanese horror</p>
<p>movie yeah ringgu</p>
<p>you know i&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>watch ringgu</p>
<p>pandora&rsquo;s labyrinth</p>
<p>people want to believe man they want to believe</p>
<p>and they don&rsquo;t want you to take it away from them</p>

<p>the twilight zone</p>
<p>oh yeah 1959 and 196 they just</p>
<p>added a bunch of shit</p>
<p>and i thought</p>
<p>about you because the very</p>
<p>first episode is an episode called</p>
<p>where is everybody</p>
<p>where the man is</p>
<p>undergoing a sensory deprivation</p>
<p>experiment and losing his fucking mind</p>
<p>doing it is</p>
<p>revealed at the end obviously that it&rsquo;s a military</p>
<p>experiment but</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s uh that show</p>

<p>movies they</p>
<p>seem a lot better because they were a long time ago</p>
<p>and you go back and</p>
<p>watch them you go</p>
<p>yeah that wasn&rsquo;t that good</p>
<p>or i was just</p>
<p>young and dumb</p>
<p>i remember donnie</p>
<p>darko being</p>
<p>weird it was</p>
<p>weird but it does have</p>
<p>it does hold up have you ever seen primer</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the best time</p>
<p>travel movie ever a</p>
<p>great movie yeah</p>
<p>that one is that you got to</p>
<p>watch that one</p>
<p>a few times</p>
<p>really independent</p>
<p>movie very small</p>
<p>budget considered</p>
<p>like one of the best i mean you</p>
<p>know you talk back to the future that&rsquo;s you know for</p>
<p>layman&rsquo;s purposes that works great yeah</p>
<p>they they laid the rules for</p>
<p>but primer is one of those</p>
<p>where they really adhere to the rules and the time</p>
<p>the fabric of time and</p>
<p>how you can&rsquo;t do this and you can</p>
<p>get sick and all that</p>
<p>the things nuances</p>
<p>about actual time</p>
<p>traveling that people have</p>
<p>taken to study</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s what</p>
<p>would happen to your body if you did that time</p>
<p>travel is the most fascinating subject of all to me i</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t think of it i mean i</p>
<p>think eventually it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>going to be breached</p>
<p>it has to be</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the end of time</p>
<p>human beings are</p>
<p>gonna figure out everything</p>
<p>we figured out so much so far and we were not</p>
<p>gonna stop and as long as we stay</p>
<p>alive they just</p>
<p>found some they just</p>
<p>found out that the caldera volcano</p>
<p>under yellowstone is way bigger than</p>
<p>previously thought oh really</p>
<p>fucking giant</p>
<p>super volcano that kills everybody</p>
<p>just found it&rsquo;s even bigger</p>
<p>anyway it&rsquo;s if something like that</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t happen</p>
<p>people are gonna continue to</p>
<p>innovate they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna continue to make a faster</p>
<p>phone a faster computer</p>
<p>a car that doesn&rsquo;t need to be recharged for a</p>
<p>month it&rsquo;s gonna</p>
<p>be internet through the air</p>
<p>at ridiculous</p>
<p>broadband fiber optic</p>
<p>speeds it&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>gonna eventually come to a</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s got to come to that rate kurzweil</p>
<p>singularity that terrence mckenna</p>
<p>time wave zero</p>
<p>point of infinite</p>
<p>novelty it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna happen man it has to</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a thing</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>you see more and more articles that talk about how</p>
<p>in theory i think it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>i mean what</p>
<p>einstein proved in theory it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>absolutely possible</p>
<p>but now they&rsquo;re really</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s funding private funding but funding</p>
<p>going towards</p>
<p>actually taking this seriously if we&rsquo;re gonna take</p>
<p>christ and all that seriously let&rsquo;s</p>
<p>take this seriously dude it&rsquo;s just like the nuclear</p>
<p>power issue they</p>
<p>were there the nuclear</p>
<p>power issue</p>
<p>is something</p>
<p>where they they came up with something</p>
<p>and they figured</p>
<p>out how to do it and then they just went</p>
<p>ahead and do it</p>
<p>without having it</p>
<p>completely worked out all</p>
<p>right they went</p>
<p>ahead and did it without</p>
<p>having some</p>
<p>you know agreed upon you know</p>
<p>ability to shut it off</p>
<p>right without having some agreed upon</p>
<p>ability to to</p>
<p>store all the</p>
<p>waste before we</p>
<p>start producing it</p>
<p>they just started doing it they just</p>
<p>started doing it</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna do that with</p>
<p>everything man but they did that with the</p>
<p>space program all that they did</p>
<p>that they do that with everything</p>
<p>they do that they&rsquo;re doing with the</p>
<p>large hadron collider</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re out there you know</p>
<p>smashing atoms making the higgs boston particle</p>
<p>and creating little miniature</p>
<p>black holes they really are not exactly sure what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna happen</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re taking some chances and sometimes</p>
<p>things go wrong</p>
<p>and things are</p>
<p>going wrong in</p>
<p>japan right now</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna continue to go</p>
<p>wrong and as well as go right</p>
<p>no matter what</p>
<p>things are gonna keep moving</p>
<p>they moved past the nuclear bombs of the 1940s</p>
<p>to what we&rsquo;re capable of</p>
<p>today and that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be nothing compared to antimatter</p>
<p>weapons that they&rsquo;re coming up with</p>
<p>right now they&rsquo;re coming up with some shit</p>
<p>right now ray guns</p>
<p>actual ray guns that work</p>
<p>have you seen the</p>
<p>laser that they shot down</p>
<p>they did a demonstration recently where</p>
<p>a boat was a mile away and they shot it with this</p>
<p>laser and caused</p>
<p>the engines to</p>
<p>catch on fire from a mile away</p>
<p>you know so they&rsquo;ve got some</p>
<p>crazy shit they&rsquo;re working on</p>
<p>right now that&rsquo;s pretty dope</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s nothing compared to i&rsquo;m sure a</p>
<p>bunch of their shit</p>
<p>the drones the</p>
<p>drones are the scariest thing man</p>
<p>these fucking</p>
<p>their ability to operate</p>
<p>these little tiny machines that look like bugs yeah</p>
<p>they can get them little tiny ones and fly</p>
<p>them around and fucking make</p>
<p>videos of people and shit dude</p>

<p>thing for the</p>

<p>somehow or another is acceptable</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the most</p>
<p>ridiculous hoax not</p>
<p>just acceptable</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s fortuitous for them it&rsquo;s a career</p>
<p>builder i mean she&rsquo;s who she is because of that</p>
<p>taste she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gigantic dude she&rsquo;s gigantic</p>

<p>businessman</p>
<p>everyone gets</p>
<p>into clocks g&rsquo;s that</p>
<p>bitch is on billboards in australia yeah</p>
<p>she was on cosmos cover of</p>
<p>turkey version yesterday</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a big uproar because</p>
<p>turkey put her on the cover of</p>
<p>the turkish version of cosmo and you know</p>
<p>turks and armenians</p>
<p>little bad blood there</p>
<p>oh really and</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s an armenian and she&rsquo;s an armenian and</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s gracing the</p>
<p>cover of a turkish publication</p>
<p>not by her choice cosmo went and did it without her</p>
<p>but it was funny a</p>
<p>bunch of armenians got pissed</p>
<p>cause kobe bryant did</p>
<p>a spot for turkish airlines</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like he&rsquo;s gotten a</p>
<p>horse in that race you know what i mean that i</p>
<p>understand he</p>
<p>should do that but her it&rsquo;s like that&rsquo;s a little</p>
<p>weird that&rsquo;s a little weird</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a little weird like</p>
<p>morty salman</p>
<p>wearing a swastika</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost</p>
<p>the way society set up</p>
<p>right now with like</p>
<p>these teen mom shows and the real</p>
<p>housewives of beverly hills</p>
<p>kim kardashian it&rsquo;s almost like</p>
<p>the scene in the running man</p>
<p>when they have</p>
<p>those ridiculous shows you know</p>
<p>yeah you know that</p>
<p>movie is so accurate you&rsquo;re so</p>
<p>right it&rsquo;s almost like it&rsquo;s getting to this</p>
<p>weird sort of surreal point</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>wow this is what everyone&rsquo;s fixated on a fascinated by</p>
<p>16 year olds that get</p>
<p>knocked up have a tv show now</p>
<p>and you see them</p>
<p>scream at their boyfriend get up you fucking lazy fat</p>
<p>piece of shit beat</p>
<p>the hell out of him beeping and</p>
<p>everything&rsquo;s beeping and the guy</p>
<p>gets in the car and he&rsquo;s taking the baby and the girl</p>
<p>screaming in his face</p>
<p>big dude getting</p>
<p>what the fuck are we</p>
<p>watching and you wonder why people have lost</p>
<p>their psychic abilities and all that shit i used to</p>
<p>think that when i was doing fear factor</p>
<p>when i was doing fear factor i was like we are</p>
<p>three seasons away from the running man yeah we&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>right here we&rsquo;re right here</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll come they&rsquo;ll line up</p>
<p>we were doing fear factor</p>
<p>and you know</p>
<p>everybody&rsquo;s like well you know that shows like that</p>
<p>man are designed by the government to keep you soft and</p>
<p>no no they&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re made by people</p>
<p>cause that&rsquo;s what people</p>
<p>wanna see but</p>
<p>even the people making them it&rsquo;s not like they&rsquo;re the</p>
<p>grand programmers of</p>
<p>the universe and they&rsquo;ve done this on purpose to try to</p>
<p>lower people&rsquo;s standards</p>
<p>no this is what you</p>
<p>wanna see man</p>
<p>you really do</p>
<p>wanna see some dumb shit it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>reflection of society that&rsquo;s what they want</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a fascinating</p>
<p>thing to be</p>
<p>a part of too because when we were doing fear factor</p>
<p>while we were doing it we were all</p>
<p>going are they really letting us do this</p>
<p>like it was</p>
<p>we know would say okay</p>
<p>we said we&rsquo;re gonna</p>
<p>blend rats what did they say</p>
<p>they said good we got a</p>
<p>green light you got a</p>
<p>green light on</p>
<p>blending rats</p>
<p>what about drink your own piss</p>
<p>no we just got a red</p>
<p>light can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>drink your own piss with</p>
<p>every now and then we get red</p>
<p>lights you know</p>
<p>okay how about</p>
<p>eat a buffalo dick</p>
<p>i remember that</p>
<p>green light</p>
<p>green light</p>
<p>eat buffalo dicks</p>
<p>we can eat buffalo dicks holy shit</p>
<p>and we tell</p>
<p>them it&rsquo;s buffalo dicks yes you&rsquo;re allowed to tell him</p>
<p>how about balls</p>
<p>yes you can eat balls remember we have boiled balls</p>
<p>giant bull testicles with the skin on them all the</p>
<p>veins around it</p>
<p>you like did</p>
<p>you ever get sick</p>
<p>watching them do that</p>
<p>stuff oh bunch of times</p>
<p>i never threw up on the set i only</p>
<p>threw up at home once</p>
<p>funny enough i</p>
<p>would watch</p>
<p>that show with my nose plug</p>
<p>thinking like just reflectively</p>
<p>i would literally</p>
<p>watch like this</p>
<p>cause i&rsquo;d feel like i&rsquo;d</p>
<p>catch a whiff of something</p>
<p>you know it wasn&rsquo;t the most fun</p>
<p>thing to do</p>
<p>you know because it was really fun sometimes but</p>
<p>other times it was fucking</p>
<p>tedious as hell</p>
<p>but looking back on it like wow i was a part of some</p>
<p>weird part of fucking</p>
<p>television history</p>
<p>one of the most unique</p>
<p>shows ever there&rsquo;s nothing before or</p>
<p>after that&rsquo;s like it</p>
<p>sorry it was</p>
<p>so strange to be a part of it i was at the 99 cent</p>
<p>store the other day and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>still selling like fear factor</p>
<p>candy like yeah</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s got a show around the</p>
<p>world still</p>
<p>right yeah yeah i get</p>
<p>emails from people sometimes</p>
<p>in other countries</p>
<p>where just started showing just discovered fear factor</p>
<p>yeah for real</p>
<p>thank you the just</p>
<p>started there you know the country just got it i know</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s countries who are just now getting like</p>
<p>i guess apparently</p>
<p>my sister&rsquo;s</p>
<p>boyfriend is from germany he was saying like you know</p>
<p>they showed knight rider</p>
<p>you know like now</p>
<p>there like because</p>
<p>david hasselhoff</p>
<p>david hasselhoff and they</p>
<p>pride him but they&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>countries will get</p>
<p>stuff that we are done with like that that</p>
<p>wrapped in the 90s that</p>
<p>wrapped in the 80s</p>
<p>but they&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>think it&rsquo;s new</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>dress accordingly</p>
<p>is it weird when a</p>
<p>comic goes to</p>
<p>another country and becomes big in that country</p>
<p>oh yeah that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>weird that is</p>
<p>right when they did they&rsquo;re not big in america</p>
<p>but they go somewhere when they become big yeah</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s real strange</p>
<p>right that&rsquo;s real</p>
<p>weird especially if it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>if your native country you can&rsquo;t seem to find</p>
<p>i mean it&rsquo;s different with</p>
<p>musicians hendrix did it</p>
<p>you know right a few</p>
<p>other guys yeah</p>
<p>but they came to america and</p>
<p>america&rsquo;s always been</p>
<p>at the top of the ice</p>
<p>cream pile that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>where the cherry is that&rsquo;s the whole</p>
<p>yeah i mean it&rsquo;s still</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the grand</p>
<p>you know the big</p>
<p>stage supposedly</p>
<p>right but for like a lot of</p>
<p>comics like</p>
<p>going to other</p>
<p>countries you become more</p>
<p>successful yeah you</p>
<p>know like arg barker is gigantic in australia too is he</p>
<p>oh my god dude</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like richard pryor in australia</p>
<p>no bullshit man</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s fucking huge how did that happen as</p>
<p>a cartoon or</p>
<p>well i guess he went over there</p>
<p>and kicked ass went on a</p>
<p>bunch of tours did a</p>
<p>bunch of tours over there and they just love him</p>
<p>he lives there now</p>
<p>apparently he</p>
<p>got a house there and he&rsquo;s like fuck it</p>
<p>he comes on tour in america but</p>
<p>most of the time he</p>
<p>spends in australia</p>
<p>sells out like you know fucking 20 30</p>
<p>nights in a row at</p>
<p>places i was wondering what happened to him because</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like around the time like him demetri martin</p>
<p>started getting a lot of attention</p>
<p>that seems like one kind of went the other way</p>
<p>he went to australia and just</p>
<p>started kicking ass good for him</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s like the biggest comic</p>
<p>in australia i</p>
<p>think pablo</p>
<p>giant is pretty well</p>
<p>worldwide doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>he he does huge in like finland yeah</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s got some pockets of</p>
<p>out there he&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>silly too you don&rsquo;t really have to be</p>
<p>adept at the language to</p>
<p>understand pablo well that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>thing is the language</p>
<p>barrier would i think</p>
<p>certainly have to keep me in english</p>
<p>speaking only nations obviously</p>
<p>and even the most</p>
<p>you know americanized ones because it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>well a lot of europe</p>
<p>speaks english as well yeah if they come to your show</p>
<p>you know i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>done shows in ireland i&rsquo;ve done shows you know</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve done shows in</p>
<p>a bunch of i</p>
<p>never did germany</p>
<p>but i&rsquo;ve done them all throughout the uk</p>
<p>and you get people that</p>
<p>speak a gang of different languages and english</p>
<p>right french english they</p>
<p>speak it all</p>
<p>it just seems to me like i</p>
<p>watched a documentary what</p>
<p>eddie is heard</p>
<p>learned french to do a set in france</p>
<p>whoa that was</p>
<p>pretty cool and connected with them not as much as he</p>
<p>would want to</p>
<p>but he learned french now growing up a brit</p>
<p>he probably knew his fair</p>
<p>share as it was dude</p>
<p>eddie isard&rsquo;s a bad</p>
<p>motherfucker</p>
<p>i used to think he&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>silly man with a dress on</p>
<p>like when i</p>
<p>first saw him like</p>
<p>cross dressing</p>
<p>what is it what kind of</p>
<p>weird gimmick is that</p>
<p>then i saw him do this one show</p>
<p>where he went on a marathon</p>
<p>every day for like 30 fucking days or something</p>
<p>crazy like that</p>
<p>might have been even more than 30 days</p>
<p>something nuts man</p>
<p>this guy ran all the way around the uk</p>
<p>oh wow dude it was</p>
<p>ridiculous they</p>
<p>filmed him they followed him around with cameras</p>
<p>i mean he got hurt man his feet were fucked up</p>
<p>he kept running his legs</p>
<p>would not up he</p>
<p>could barely move he</p>
<p>could barely</p>
<p>shuffle for it what was</p>
<p>he kept going for</p>
<p>i forget some sort</p>
<p>of charity thing yeah i</p>
<p>watched a documentary on him</p>
<p>and they talked</p>
<p>about the address of</p>
<p>cross dressing</p>
<p>issue but by</p>
<p>the time you get done with the film he&rsquo;s so fascinating</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just a little side</p>
<p>thing to the</p>
<p>point where you don&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>think of it anymore you know what i mean he&rsquo;s a bad</p>
<p>motherfucker it is a</p>
<p>crosstresting</p>
<p>dude it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>crosstressing</p>
<p>thing where it&rsquo;s like guy who</p>
<p>smokes cigarettes it&rsquo;s like i kind of need to do it</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>literally like i have to do it</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s not like i&rsquo;m not into dudes nothing</p>
<p>like that i just really need to do this once a day</p>
<p>and i was just like wow</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what he</p>
<p>would do when he</p>
<p>would go on</p>
<p>stage like he was really like that</p>
<p>was he was into</p>
<p>cross dressing</p>
<p>right he&rsquo;s just into</p>
<p>cross dressing there&rsquo;s no so it</p>
<p>wasn&rsquo;t a gimmick it&rsquo;s not a gimmick there was no sexual</p>
<p>thing it was just some</p>
<p>is no sexual</p>
<p>thing i mean it&rsquo;s probably so he says</p>
<p>he always says</p>
<p>right people know you like but he</p>
<p>did he was so interesting he made you forget that he</p>
<p>dressed like that yeah</p>
<p>yeah he&rsquo;s a bad</p>
<p>motherfucker</p>
<p>anybody can run a marathon</p>
<p>every day as many days as he did it was it was a</p>
<p>ridiculous documentary</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know why it didn&rsquo;t air in america</p>
<p>because nbc or someone</p>
<p>should have picked it up</p>
<p>because it was really compelling it is interesting they</p>
<p>should have aired it simultaneously</p>
<p>it was really</p>
<p>compelling i mean if they had room for it anywhere it</p>
<p>would have done</p>
<p>very well because it was really gripping</p>
<p>i started it not</p>
<p>thinking that i was</p>
<p>going to get into it at all so</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s a fuck about some</p>
<p>idiot running everywhere</p>
<p>you know i&rsquo;m like this is stupid</p>

<p>think you need</p>
<p>a license to</p>

<p>water that you need</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s fresh water and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all that urban</p>
<p>stuff you have to get that</p>
<p>local urban</p>
<p>license and then you have to get the lake</p>
<p>license but</p>
<p>i fish any chance i get it&rsquo;s so much like comedy it&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>patience game it&rsquo;s fun when you get good at it you get</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not good</p>
<p>at it i just do it a lot but i&rsquo;m getting better</p>
<p>i used to fish</p>
<p>all the time when i was living in jamaica</p>
<p>plain i used to go to jamaica pond and catch</p>
<p>big ass fucking rainbow trout oh yeah</p>
<p>yeah we catch a lot of fish there man</p>
<p>and there was a lake</p>
<p>massachusetts is</p>
<p>great because there was a lot of different</p>
<p>places to fish when i was a kid</p>
<p>but there was a lake near my</p>
<p>house in newton i caught a</p>
<p>three pound bass in this little tiny ass pond</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a big ass fucking bounce just</p>
<p>dominating shit in this pond i think</p>
<p>streaming and fishing</p>
<p>would sound so good together</p>
<p>just hanging</p>
<p>out i&rsquo;d get</p>
<p>freaked out by my own bait</p>
<p>i use lures</p>
<p>i have a top water hook</p>
<p>i&rsquo;d be afraid of it you know what i mean</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;ve gotten</p>
<p>into lures now like as a kid i was always live bait</p>
<p>but now i&rsquo;m into lures the</p>
<p>sport the art of fishing and i got</p>
<p>into fly fishing recently that&rsquo;s some cool shit dude</p>
<p>i used to love i am no</p>
<p>good at it man</p>
<p>catching so awesome</p>
<p>i used to love</p>
<p>catching bass on</p>
<p>floating rapalas</p>
<p>oh yeah cast them out then just</p>
<p>twitch it a</p>
<p>little bit like a little fish that&rsquo;s fucked up</p>
<p>bass are like torpedoes</p>
<p>held that fucking</p>
<p>thing like they couldn&rsquo;t they</p>
<p>could not hit it dude you want to</p>
<p>catch bass too</p>
<p>spoons that&rsquo;s the best way</p>
<p>spoons the silver</p>
<p>things have</p>
<p>clicked dying minnows</p>
<p>against the</p>
<p>stream that was the coolest</p>
<p>thing about fishing when i was a kid you</p>
<p>never knew what the fuck they wanted that day yeah</p>
<p>one day it was plastic worms the next day it was</p>
<p>spinner baits</p>
<p>it was all different</p>
<p>things to catch them with</p>
<p>or they were</p>
<p>smarter and</p>
<p>wiser to somebody and you&rsquo;d be fishing with somebody</p>
<p>like what did he use and he caught something</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;d lose all</p>
<p>confidence in what you had on</p>
<p>god damn it i need to get one of those</p>
<p>we go to this place</p>
<p>my buddy one of the</p>
<p>places i go my mom lives next door to a lake</p>
<p>just one of</p>
<p>these community lakes</p>
<p>i go fish there pull catfish out of there i go to my</p>

<p>has given me in my 30s this whole new</p>
<p>it exercises</p>
<p>the patience like i&rsquo;ve got a lot more patience now</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something</p>
<p>visceral about hooking a big fish too man you</p>
<p>know it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>something it just goes</p>
<p>it charges up</p>
<p>some caveman instinct and</p>
<p>nature you you</p>
<p>you won that day</p>
<p>you know you won that day and i i&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>places where it&rsquo;s like you know there&rsquo;s big</p>
<p>whale swimming but they&rsquo;re not biting nothing</p>
<p>but then there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>other nights</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s like you know you</p>
<p>i was at my mom&rsquo;s</p>
<p>house when i said i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>going to catch a fucking fish right now</p>

<p>all these fucking</p>
<p>hi vegan fucking weirdo hippie dudes</p>
<p>wigged out you</p>
<p>know what you</p>
<p>would if you had to eat</p>
<p>if i had to eat yeah</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>if you were living on a</p>
<p>ranch and there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t be a dick hunter huh yeah</p>
<p>dress it and use</p>
<p>every part of birds</p>
<p>did the bird shit</p>
<p>hunting ducks and</p>
<p>shit fuck that but i used to hunt as a kid i used to</p>
<p>shoot things i just got sick of it i saw</p>
<p>a rabbit out in your front yard</p>
<p>my mind was like</p>
<p>where&rsquo;s my red</p>
<p>rider baby i really</p>
<p>blast him but i was like did you eat them</p>
<p>yeah you see him yeah</p>
<p>how good is rabbit</p>
<p>pretty gamey pretty lean you know</p>
<p>if you figure</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like venison when you eat that kind of</p>
<p>stuff any kind of fast moving animal</p>
<p>is always gonna be very</p>
<p>tough you know</p>
<p>if you have to make a stew or something like that</p>
<p>we marinate</p>
<p>it for about</p>
<p>three or four days and then</p>
<p>ended up yeah making like a stew</p>
<p>three or four days yeah</p>
<p>really like</p>
<p>sitting there</p>
<p>in the crockpot</p>
<p>field dress that throw it</p>
<p>right in there in the fridge and let it sit in that</p>
<p>it was jackrabbit this</p>
<p>same subject came up yesterday when i was on the adam</p>
<p>carolla show we&rsquo;re talking about</p>
<p>cooking your own food and</p>
<p>hunting and gathering your own food and how some people</p>
<p>are so opposed to it</p>
<p>even though they eat meat</p>
<p>so we&rsquo;re so</p>
<p>weird as human beings we&rsquo;re in this</p>
<p>weird stage of</p>
<p>getting past</p>
<p>being an animal</p>
<p>and all the shit that&rsquo;s connected to be an animal like</p>
<p>killing food</p>
<p>and causing suffering in order so</p>
<p>that you survive</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re so separated</p>
<p>ourselves from all that shit it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ve become some</p>
<p>weird thing</p>
<p>outside of nature</p>
<p>that connects to nature we have</p>
<p>agents that do the nature</p>
<p>thing for us</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s true</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very strange</p>
<p>you see all</p>
<p>these now these</p>
<p>documentaries on exposing how your meat is made i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>watched everyone</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s just like wow</p>
<p>okay but i still</p>
<p>gonna eat meat</p>
<p>cause i get</p>
<p>it but i won&rsquo;t eat that kind of meat like now i get</p>
<p>the whole purpose of</p>
<p>going to a ranch</p>
<p>and buying fresh</p>
<p>farm shit i</p>
<p>ate taco bell the</p>
<p>other day and i knew</p>
<p>that study that it&rsquo;s not even meat but i</p>
<p>still ate it</p>
<p>what is it fillers</p>
<p>they said it&rsquo;s filled with</p>
<p>cardboard or something you know the</p>
<p>thing is it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>like i don&rsquo;t eat the fast food but it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>i would be a hunter if i lived out</p>
<p>in montana and i</p>
<p>would field</p>
<p>dress it and use</p>
<p>every part the right way</p>
<p>like a real hunter does i have nothing</p>
<p>against that</p>
<p>right you know what i mean i&rsquo;m not doing</p>
<p>drive bys on fucking deer and just leaving them out</p>
<p>there well the</p>
<p>thing you use it</p>
<p>right i&rsquo;m all for it</p>
<p>you really do have to kill them and people need to wrap</p>
<p>their heads around that because</p>
<p>otherwise you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna have a massive amount of predators and</p>
<p>starvation hunting keeps the</p>
<p>population go to west virginia go to</p>
<p>these places</p>
<p>where they&rsquo;re like fuck deer</p>
<p>yeah fuck deer</p>
<p>you know you</p>
<p>wait for hunting</p>
<p>season to come</p>
<p>yeah well in</p>
<p>colorado man</p>
<p>you have to be careful</p>
<p>everywhere you drive</p>
<p>especially when in boulder</p>
<p>is in boulder</p>
<p>no one shoots them and they&rsquo;re in the mountains</p>
<p>so you know you&rsquo;re in a town</p>
<p>so no one&rsquo;s</p>
<p>shooting these deer so they&rsquo;re fucking</p>
<p>everywhere and</p>
<p>everywhere you go you gotta</p>
<p>make sure some asshole deer</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t jump out in</p>
<p>front of the road and slam into your</p>
<p>car you ever been to alaska had that happen with the</p>
<p>moose there no</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s gonna</p>
<p>be crazy god</p>
<p>i saw moose</p>
<p>everywhere and it&rsquo;s like sure enough one was</p>
<p>standing in the road when we</p>
<p>were leaving to go to the airport they dangerous well</p>
<p>they won&rsquo;t attack you but</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re so tall that</p>
<p>their knees are at europe</p>
<p>basically top of your car</p>
<p>so when you hit them</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna bring this</p>
<p>2 000 pounds is</p>
<p>gonna come rushing</p>
<p>right in your windshield</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re perfectly set up to come in and kill you</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s what happens is they come in and just</p>
<p>you hit them</p>
<p>and they fall into the cab of your car you just get</p>
<p>crushed they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>enormous man</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like before the elephant falling on you yeah</p>
<p>yeah they&rsquo;re massive animals i mean</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re territorial they&rsquo;ll come</p>
<p>after you if they have to but they&rsquo;re like deer</p>
<p>a deer will fuck you up if it has to</p>
<p>but nine times out of ten it&rsquo;ll just bail</p>

<p>radio station we did an anchorage</p>
<p>bob bob was friends with him</p>
<p>you played pool with them</p>
<p>played pool with him but i didn&rsquo;t know it till years</p>
<p>later this was six</p>
<p>seven years ago did he seem like he was gay</p>
<p>it didn&rsquo;t seem</p>
<p>like anything because he didn&rsquo;t matter to me he</p>
<p>still had the same kind of like goatee</p>
<p>and hair you know that looked very suspicious</p>
<p>you know like</p>
<p>the look that he rocks</p>
<p>whatever you</p>
<p>think his look was like bison</p>
<p>but with the way he says</p>
<p>suspicious you mean like disingenuous</p>
<p>no very mid 90s very out of</p>
<p>place for the year 2006 as it was yeah off</p>
<p>right i was like either he&rsquo;s a time</p>
<p>traveler out of</p>
<p>style what do</p>
<p>you do you are you</p>
<p>the type of guy that like when you see a</p>
<p>powerful woman</p>
<p>with some guy</p>
<p>behind her who&rsquo;s not really talking that much</p>
<p>do you just automatically assume</p>
<p>that he&rsquo;s a bitch</p>
<p>yeah right yeah</p>
<p>not to be a pig or nothing but yeah i do yeah</p>
<p>i do when i see a really</p>
<p>powerful woman i want to see</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s this guy like</p>
<p>is he more powerful</p>
<p>or is he less we&rsquo;ll see</p>
<p>steadman might be more powerful</p>
<p>what oprah&rsquo;s man what do you</p>
<p>think what are you talking</p>
<p>about i think</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t he pretty rich</p>
<p>is he on his own yeah he</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t be rich like over rich i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think nobody&rsquo;s over rich i&rsquo;m so glad we got to talk</p>
<p>about oprah oh yeah</p>
<p>why we talked</p>
<p>about kitties now we talk about opra</p>
<p>i just love it when joe talks oprah</p>
<p>i watch the opra</p>
<p>show sometimes yeah</p>
<p>subscribe to oh</p>
<p>do you like her no</p>
<p>yeah i think she&rsquo;s interesting i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think she&rsquo;s a bad person she&rsquo;s a good person</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s doing she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>spreading positive energy and she&rsquo;s an easy</p>
<p>target would you bang her joe rogan</p>
<p>her or ellen</p>
<p>her or ellen who&rsquo;d i bang</p>
<p>i&rsquo;d bang over i</p>
<p>think oprah</p>
<p>yeah because she</p>
<p>would probably dollar</p>
<p>pussy she would probably like it</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s billion dollars</p>
<p>alan would probably be</p>
<p>angry at me</p>
<p>i mean that is</p>
<p>assuming that oprah is</p>
<p>truly homosexual</p>
<p>heterosexual rather that</p>
<p>would be hot though</p>
<p>you know i was like i don&rsquo;t want this dick</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re taking</p>
<p>this dick not me you got a different</p>
<p>thing that turns you on buddy</p>
<p>and he checked it</p>
<p>well you know</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s two types of</p>
<p>lesbians there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>lesbians by genetics or</p>
<p>lesbians by circumstance</p>
<p>and lesbians by life you know</p>
<p>lesbians by</p>
<p>abusive men</p>
<p>and those are the</p>
<p>scary ones not</p>
<p>scary but sad i</p>
<p>should say sad</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve met a lot of</p>
<p>girls that fuck</p>
<p>they just met so many fucking asshole</p>
<p>men from their father</p>
<p>all the way down to</p>
<p>every fucking guy they&rsquo;ve ever attracted</p>
<p>and they just like fuck men i need accompaniment</p>
<p>my girl&rsquo;s always</p>
<p>been there for me and you hug this girl next</p>
<p>thing you know you&rsquo;re a lesbian</p>
<p>right nothing</p>
<p>wrong with that man</p>
<p>or you know i</p>
<p>think women are much more open to the idea of</p>
<p>experimenting</p>
<p>and then maybe they find that they like</p>
<p>women better</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s something that most</p>
<p>straight men</p>
<p>would never</p>
<p>do it&rsquo;s open i mean even if you&rsquo;re a girl you&rsquo;d have to</p>
<p>admit that you know</p>
<p>post a spectacular look</p>
<p>and boobs yeah and</p>
<p>these rubber</p>
<p>dicks i&rsquo;m sure they you know they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>happy with that</p>

<p>arsenic from from</p>
<p>just like that too</p>
<p>right that&rsquo;s all the</p>
<p>oceans are so goddamn</p>
<p>polluted man</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s that gigantic</p>
<p>patch of garbage</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s floating somewhere in the middle of pacific</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s not just one there&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>bunch of them yeah</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s underwater it&rsquo;s not just on the surface</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s like a fuckload of it</p>
<p>underwater and they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>enormous now they&rsquo;re almost the</p>
<p>exact size of the united</p>
<p>states yeah</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an inhabitant that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>crazy it used to be the size of texas</p>
<p>and the latest</p>
<p>one when they said it was almost the size of the united</p>
<p>states that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>ridiculous it&rsquo;s insane it&rsquo;s the scariest thing ever</p>
<p>and you know what all this shit that came from fucking</p>
<p>tokyo was all</p>
<p>added to that too by the way or from</p>
<p>japan rather</p>
<p>all that shit that got washed away</p>
<p>in the earthquake the</p>
<p>tsunami that</p>
<p>stuff&rsquo;s out at sea</p>
<p>i mean there&rsquo;s a lot of fucking</p>
<p>debris out at sea</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re finding houses</p>
<p>actual full houses</p>
<p>floating in the</p>
<p>ocean oh i&rsquo;m sure and way out there</p>
<p>too oh yeah</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ve had what</p>
<p>three seven pluses in</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so crazy that someone decided to put a goddamn</p>
<p>series of nuclear reactors on</p>
<p>fault lines like it&rsquo;s almost like</p>
<p>fault lines on an island</p>
<p>people are so silly</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like they like the the earth</p>
<p>could move but then</p>
<p>again it might not</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s man you</p>
<p>know it&rsquo;s when people</p>
<p>start to say this god</p>
<p>stuff and they</p>
<p>start to be like look</p>
<p>look at the</p>
<p>and you know it&rsquo;s like no there isn&rsquo;t a god it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>mother nature</p>
<p>being itself and we went and did something</p>
<p>stupid you know</p>
<p>well that is</p>
<p>mother nature</p>
<p>though we are insanely curious and we have this</p>
<p>weird desire to test</p>
<p>the boundaries to try</p>
<p>limitations</p>
<p>yeah to tame</p>
<p>mother nature and also to pull off the next new thing</p>
<p>to be able to get</p>
<p>power out of this gigantic</p>
<p>building that fills up the entire city</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s just some</p>
<p>i mean literally they&rsquo;re harnessing the</p>
<p>power of the fucking sun inside this</p>
<p>facility and containing it somehow or another yeah you</p>
<p>know and the real problem is i mean they&rsquo;ve made some</p>
<p>you know some safeguards and shit and make</p>
<p>things you know a little</p>
<p>bit they can contain situations a little bit better</p>
<p>clearly they didn&rsquo;t think of</p>
<p>every possible scenario</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think of a nine right</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think of a nine that</p>
<p>rattled for five minutes</p>
<p>because when you</p>
<p>think of that and you</p>
<p>think of a nine</p>
<p>you have to consider if you&rsquo;re putting out a</p>
<p>budget for something how</p>
<p>often does a nine happen not too</p>
<p>often exactly so</p>
<p>we can&rsquo;t appeal we can&rsquo;t pay for the</p>
<p>worst possible scenario we have</p>
<p>to pay for a pretty bad one what a colossal fuck up</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s another reason to get the fuck out of california</p>
<p>cause there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>all sorts of fault</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s</p>
<p>all sorts of fucking reactors there&rsquo;s one in</p>
<p>orange county anything over an</p>
<p>eight we got a big problem yeah scary</p>
<p>shit man but you know what that&rsquo;s the cost of living</p>
<p>somewhere where it&rsquo;s 75 degrees</p>
<p>every day yeah</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s not 75 degrees</p>
<p>every day in japan</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know what the deal is over there i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>not in that</p>
<p>spot i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>think the coolest shit that&rsquo;s why yeah they do have</p>
<p>this yeah this is another subject that we talked</p>
<p>about yesterday on the corolla</p>
<p>show that this is the</p>
<p>exact perfect</p>
<p>place geographically</p>
<p>as far as like climate you can&rsquo;t get any better</p>
<p>but as far as like</p>
<p>the worth of</p>
<p>human beings because there&rsquo;s so many of us</p>
<p>it becomes people</p>
<p>becomes less valuable and they become more</p>
<p>aggressive toward each</p>
<p>other and more shitty to each other</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s way</p>
<p>more cool people because there&rsquo;s so many of us</p>
<p>because just sheer numbers i mean this podcast</p>
<p>is absolute</p>
<p>proof of that</p>
<p>one of the coolest</p>
<p>things about this podcast to me</p>
<p>is like it reunites me and</p>
<p>makes me realize how many interesting</p>
<p>fucking people i know how many cool friends i have that</p>
<p>i come over and</p>
<p>we have these cool conversations and then</p>
<p>this goes out into the internet and the</p>
<p>whole world gets it it&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s not that many people that have</p>
<p>you know freddie lockhart and sam tripolis</p>
<p>and all these different characters and duncan</p>
<p>trussells and</p>
<p>you know and</p>
<p>kevin pereira there&rsquo;s all</p>
<p>these different</p>
<p>cool people and joey and ari</p>
<p>in their life i mean there&rsquo;s so many of them you</p>
<p>know and part of that is because we&rsquo;re living in this</p>
<p>giant population center and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very showbiz</p>
<p>centric so you know everyone&rsquo;s attracted to</p>
<p>spot it&rsquo;s one of the few</p>
<p>things that keeps me here really</p>
<p>i like i mean it becomes like a way of life</p>
<p>after a while and you really can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>leave it because when i&rsquo;m outside of weirdoville</p>
<p>i find the normal people to be extremely weird</p>
<p>you know what i mean</p>
<p>i find the wants and desires my friends when i go back</p>
<p>when i go back to arizona and i</p>
<p>hang out with some of my friends some of them are still</p>
<p>have their youth and they</p>
<p>still have kids and they have family but they maintain</p>
<p>their youth</p>
<p>but most of them just turn into</p>
<p>their parents</p>
<p>right and it&rsquo;s a really</p>
<p>weird thing to me that like they say depressing</p>
<p>the apex of</p>
<p>their life is over and now it&rsquo;s just kind of like</p>
<p>going through the motions where i</p>
<p>still like to</p>
<p>think the best is yet to come</p>
<p>well you you</p>
<p>have a different career than that yeah i have a regular</p>
<p>career you&rsquo;re a guy who</p>
<p>sells buicks</p>
<p>whatever the fuck you are</p>
<p>right but when people add you on facebook how</p>
<p>crazy different do they look like than</p>
<p>you us you know</p>
<p>like people</p>
<p>adding me to</p>
<p>facebook from high</p>
<p>school and stuff i&rsquo;m like holy shit that looks</p>
<p>like my dad&rsquo;s</p>
<p>friends now yeah well</p>
<p>those poor fucks have to work for a living</p>
<p>yeah those poor fucks are out</p>
<p>there grinding</p>
<p>just visually</p>
<p>they just look like stress 20 or 30 years</p>
<p>older dude look at</p>
<p>obama look at what he looks like now</p>
<p>as opposed to what</p>
<p>he was yeah dude look at bush when bush</p>
<p>got into office</p>
<p>and then towards the end look at clinton clinton&rsquo;s</p>
<p>whole head her hair went gray</p>
<p>by the time he was out</p>
<p>i mean that shit ages you any</p>
<p>extreme stress ages</p>
<p>you pick to</p>
<p>your stress</p>
<p>level compared to a guy with a real job it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>ridiculously low</p>
<p>mine is ridiculously low yeah i</p>
<p>guess you&rsquo;re right</p>
<p>about that i don&rsquo;t stress</p>
<p>about a whole lot</p>
<p>to the point</p>
<p>where i&rsquo;ve gotten</p>
<p>you know i have time to i stress all the time now</p>
<p>even if it&rsquo;s not an important</p>
<p>strike i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>you need to</p>
<p>stop doing that because your life is easy as fuck</p>
<p>even when my life is hard like the difficult shit</p>
<p>about my life is all just requires preparation</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no stress</p>
<p>because i actually</p>
<p>enjoy doing it</p>
<p>the real stress comes from something that you don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>enjoy doing it but it requires an extreme</p>
<p>amount of preparation and extreme amount of time</p>
<p>and you put all this</p>
<p>effort into something you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t even like and you&rsquo;re just doing it just for money</p>
<p>you know if you&rsquo;re a lawyer and you don&rsquo;t like being</p>
<p>a lawyer you&rsquo;re just doing it because there&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>money in it that will fucking break in i</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s what brought us all here is we have that</p>
<p>childlike thing in us that says i want to do this</p>
<p>thing i always wanted to do and</p>
<p>see it through</p>
<p>you have to be completely</p>
<p>childlike to believe you</p>
<p>could actually pull it off</p>
<p>i remember when i was a kid</p>
<p>i was dating</p>
<p>this girl i was 21 she was a really nice girl</p>
<p>her name was jennifer and she was a sweetheart</p>
<p>we were both really</p>
<p>young and really stupid</p>
<p>and you know she was just getting out of college and</p>
<p>i was a psychopath</p>
<p>and her father did not want</p>
<p>her hanging around</p>
<p>with me but she was like he&rsquo;s trying to be a comedian</p>
<p>oh yeah what are the odds that he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna make it</p>
<p>like this kid is not gonna he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>gonna be a loser</p>
<p>and i remember sitting and</p>
<p>thinking about</p>
<p>going wow i</p>
<p>never even considered that right</p>
<p>right yeah i just find</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m just gonna do this man i&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>gonna do this like i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>gonna do it</p>
<p>what if you</p>
<p>what if you fail what if you do</p>
<p>what if you feel</p>
<p>maybe i don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>right now i got to just do this</p>

<p>i got a fucking get some</p>
<p>gas in my tank</p>
<p>right i&rsquo;m not thinking</p>
<p>about not doing it man i</p>
<p>might fuck up i</p>
<p>might fail yeah i&rsquo;m terrified of being a</p>
<p>loser absolutely</p>
<p>but i&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>gonna just sit here</p>
<p>dwell on it</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m gonna go for it</p>
<p>most people would not</p>
<p>be a comedian</p>
<p>they want predictability in</p>
<p>their lives and they want</p>
<p>their lives to be</p>
<p>mapped out for them and it&rsquo;s like i live</p>
<p>day to day i</p>

<p>wanting you to make them laugh</p>
<p>paying to see you talk and they&rsquo;re gonna be</p>
<p>drinking that&rsquo;s awesome</p>
<p>but to a lot of people that idea is horrifying</p>
<p>if you went to</p>
<p>any town hall</p>
<p>or town hall</p>
<p>what am i even talking</p>
<p>about go to</p>
<p>any store and take some guy who&rsquo;s working behind the</p>
<p>counter you know is</p>
<p>a cashier and</p>
<p>say okay we were gonna</p>
<p>you got one day to come up with a</p>
<p>bunch of shit to say</p>
<p>and then you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna go on</p>
<p>stage in front of</p>
<p>these rabid animals</p>
<p>and some comedy club in philadelphia</p>
<p>that&rsquo;d be the most terrifying</p>
<p>thing in the</p>
<p>world for you</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m telling you</p>
<p>as i&rsquo;m telling you you&rsquo;re getting this big smile</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re getting excited</p>
<p>oh man that</p>
<p>sounds like fun yeah look at you you&rsquo;re thinking</p>
<p>about it but that&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>thing it&rsquo;s like yeah we were</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re supposed to be doing i&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>been doing this for so long that it&rsquo;s like that&rsquo;s super</p>
<p>exciting to me</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s like you know i&rsquo;ll meet people</p>
<p>like they&rsquo;ll hang out with you before your show or</p>
<p>something but you&rsquo;re nervous i&rsquo;m like what what about</p>
<p>about your show tonight and you don&rsquo;t even</p>
<p>thinking it i won&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>about my show till it&rsquo;s time to go to the show</p>
<p>people do they don&rsquo;t realize that you</p>
<p>would get nervous it was your</p>
<p>first time ever on</p>
<p>stage and you&rsquo;d</p>
<p>never done it before</p>
<p>but once you do it a</p>
<p>bunch of times it becomes a</p>
<p>thing you do</p>
<p>you get excited</p>
<p>i mean but you make sure you do your preparation</p>
<p>and then you don&rsquo;t get nervous yeah</p>
<p>granted there&rsquo;s that flight or flight feeling</p>
<p>right before i go to</p>
<p>space butterflies to let me know i&rsquo;m a</p>
<p>human and i&rsquo;m alive</p>
<p>harnessed it and i take that adrenaline and make it</p>
<p>happy time instead of</p>
<p>and i think we talked</p>
<p>about last time that</p>
<p>adrenaline is what prevents you from farting sneezing</p>
<p>having to puke on stage</p>
<p>all those shut down</p>
<p>peeing and you just go</p>
<p>right into fight or flight</p>
<p>where you have to be</p>
<p>focus focus</p>
<p>focus focus</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve never had to stop a show</p>
<p>cause i had to pee</p>
<p>never had to pee</p>
<p>never had to poop</p>
<p>never had to</p>
<p>never i&rsquo;m lactose intolerant</p>
<p>i could be up there</p>
<p>drinking milk and i won&rsquo;t have to stop the show</p>
