    <p>hi friends how are you today</p>
<p>i hope you&rsquo;re having a wonderful day so far</p>
<p>my name is bailey syrian and today is monday</p>
<p>which means it&rsquo;s murder mystery and makeup monday</p>
<p>if you are new here</p>
<p>hi my name is bailey</p>
<p>syrian and on mondays i sit down i talk</p>
<p>about true crime</p>
<p>story that&rsquo;s been heavy on my</p>
<p>not again and i do my makeup at the same time</p>
<p>so today i do have to add a disclaimer</p>
<p>i would do my normal like warning blah blah</p>
<p>blah but like today&rsquo;s story is pretty intense it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>pretty brutal</p>
<p>it involves like everything</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t really like to go into</p>
<p>graphic detail in my stories if you haven&rsquo;t noticed</p>
<p>i just kind of like</p>
<p>vaguely mention</p>
<p>things it&rsquo;s just heavy it&rsquo;s very very heavy i think</p>
<p>a lot of times we just want to hear the</p>
<p>story and not necessarily hear all the gruesome details</p>
<p>but with this</p>
<p>story it&rsquo;s almost like you can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>avoid some of the details</p>
<p>so i apologize in advance for how intense it is</p>
<p>but it just kind of involves everything this</p>
<p>story has been highly recommended</p>
<p>since day one</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;ve been</p>
<p>avoiding it just because i felt like</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s been talked</p>
<p>about a million</p>
<p>trillion times like what else can i add to it</p>
<p>but you know i&rsquo;m doing it for you guys because</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve been asking and honestly i had the</p>
<p>story so wrong i thought i knew this</p>
<p>story turns out i did not nene</p>
<p>other than that</p>
<p>i will shush my little</p>
<p>mouth and let&rsquo;s get into</p>
<p>today&rsquo;s story</p>
<p>today we&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about paul bernardo and carla</p>
<p>homoka carla</p>
<p>was seventeen years old and a high</p>
<p>school student</p>
<p>she had a part time job working at a</p>
<p>local pet shop when she</p>
<p>first met paul bernardo</p>
<p>at this time paul bernardo</p>
<p>was 23 years old</p>
<p>and attending the</p>
<p>university of toronto</p>
<p>and he was studying to become an accountant</p>
<p>now it was said that he was doing well in</p>
<p>school and he was on his way to</p>
<p>graduate october</p>
<p>seventeenth nineteen eighty</p>
<p>seven carla was attending a pet food convention</p>
<p>in scarborough</p>
<p>scarborough</p>
<p>scarborough</p>
<p>toronto ontario</p>
<p>canada so mm hmm</p>
<p>so carla is working at this convention</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re doing like pet food stuff ooh</p>
<p>and as the night</p>
<p>ended she and a coworker went down to the</p>
<p>hotel restaurant</p>
<p>to grab some food</p>
<p>so the two of</p>
<p>them they&rsquo;re eating they&rsquo;re sitting you know</p>
<p>and then that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>when paul bernardo walks into the restaurant</p>
<p>now carla and</p>
<p>paul they made eye contact like when he walked in</p>
<p>and they they say</p>
<p>or it was said that it was just an instant</p>
<p>connection lust</p>
<p>at first sight</p>
<p>paul was over six feet tall</p>
<p>he was said to be an extremely good looking guy he was</p>
<p>quite charming</p>
<p>he approached carla and the two</p>
<p>started chatting</p>
<p>it up now the two of them</p>
<p>they just clicked</p>
<p>and the coworker that was with carla was like okay well</p>
<p>i guess i&rsquo;ll be</p>
<p>going now you know</p>
<p>cause she saw that they were just hitting it off and</p>
<p>she didn&rsquo;t wanna</p>
<p>get in the way of that so she takes off</p>
<p>carla and polly</p>
<p>end up sitting there at the restaurant just talking</p>
<p>about anything and</p>
<p>everything for hours</p>
<p>and when the restaurant closed</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when the two of them headed up to carla&rsquo;s</p>
<p>hotel room where they involved in some</p>
<p>sexual relations</p>
<p>from my understanding the</p>
<p>age of consent in canada is sixteen years old so</p>
<p>not illegal but she</p>
<p>still you know there&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>a big age difference and</p>
<p>still fairly</p>
<p>young but okay</p>
<p>so carla you know</p>
<p>she was just believing that paul was the man of her</p>
<p>dreams and the two made a very good looking couple</p>
<p>paul also told many</p>
<p>of his friends that you know it was just a</p>
<p>match made in heaven</p>
<p>that he had</p>
<p>found his soulmate</p>
<p>and how he would do anything for carla and carla</p>
<p>would do anything for him</p>
<p>now carla she was the oldest of</p>
<p>three daughters</p>
<p>and she was</p>
<p>well liked in</p>
<p>school she was pretty she was somewhat popular</p>
<p>and growing up she</p>
<p>lived in st catharines</p>
<p>in the province of ontario with her family in</p>
<p>school it was said that carla</p>
<p>had many boyfriends and many boys interested in her</p>
<p>but when she met paul it was all she could talk</p>
<p>about with her friends</p>
<p>you know he was a much older man</p>
<p>he was in college and like she</p>
<p>would just brag</p>
<p>often to her friends about paul</p>
<p>and they all just thought it was so cool</p>
<p>now paul he was the youngest of</p>
<p>three children</p>
<p>it was said that he was a</p>
<p>sweet kid and had a charming</p>
<p>smile but that he had a very difficult upbringing</p>
<p>or a difficult childhood</p>
<p>his mother was</p>
<p>verbally abusive</p>
<p>towards him and his siblings then when paul was 16 he</p>
<p>found out that the man he called dad was not his</p>
<p>biological father</p>
<p>now this was upsetting</p>
<p>and it broke all</p>
<p>trust he had with his parents</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know because i read different things</p>
<p>some people say like it was an accident how he</p>
<p>found out and then some people say like his mom just</p>
<p>randomly like said it</p>
<p>when she was being</p>
<p>verbally abusive towards him</p>
<p>either way it just it really affected him</p>
<p>so again around the</p>
<p>age of 16 that&rsquo;s when paul</p>
<p>began peeping</p>
<p>through the windows of his female neighbors</p>
<p>he would watch them as they undressed</p>
<p>and he would do this like at any chance he</p>
<p>could get he</p>
<p>would watch</p>
<p>women through</p>
<p>their open windows</p>
<p>so aka a peeping tom</p>
<p>but as he got older</p>
<p>peeping through</p>
<p>windows just wasn&rsquo;t cutting it for him anymore</p>
<p>paul said that his</p>
<p>fantasies just</p>
<p>started to become darker and darker</p>
<p>and he would dream</p>
<p>about taking advantage</p>
<p>or just taking control over women</p>
<p>but at that</p>
<p>age she wasn&rsquo;t acting on it just yet but it was like</p>
<p>starting to happen</p>
<p>so yay so in september of nineteen eighty</p>
<p>three that&rsquo;s when paul</p>
<p>started studying at the</p>
<p>university of toronto in scarborough scarborough</p>
<p>come on bailey</p>
<p>scarborough</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s studying</p>
<p>there his friends and the people who knew him</p>
<p>they really liked him he had</p>
<p>again this charm</p>
<p>about him he can make friends with anyone</p>
<p>and overall</p>
<p>everyone just thought paul&rsquo;s a</p>
<p>great guy you know</p>
<p>just people wanted to be around him</p>
<p>often paul was seen as the life of the party</p>
<p>and if paul was at the</p>
<p>party then you knew was like it was</p>
<p>gonna be a good time</p>
<p>paul did have a few</p>
<p>girlfriends throughout college</p>
<p>things would always</p>
<p>start really well</p>
<p>it would be like this</p>
<p>picture perfect relationship</p>
<p>but then as time went on</p>
<p>the relationship or at</p>
<p>least their</p>
<p>sexual relationship</p>
<p>would turn more</p>
<p>abusive violent and sometimes controlling</p>
<p>and then at that point</p>
<p>is when the</p>
<p>women would</p>
<p>break it off</p>
<p>in the spring of 1988 a</p>
<p>sexual predator was roaming the streets in scarborough</p>
<p>by may there had been</p>
<p>seven different reports made by</p>
<p>women to the</p>
<p>local police</p>
<p>sharing their</p>
<p>their attacks</p>
<p>the local police they got on tv</p>
<p>and they were just warning</p>
<p>women who are watching</p>
<p>look there&rsquo;s this predator he&rsquo;s</p>
<p>still out on the streets</p>
<p>they were telling</p>
<p>women to not walk around out</p>
<p>night alone</p>
<p>to not stay out late</p>
<p>unless someone was with them and just</p>
<p>trying their best to warn everybody</p>
<p>whoever this attacker was</p>
<p>would grab women when they were leaving the bus stop at</p>
<p>night and were walking alone</p>
<p>some women were attacked when they were on</p>
<p>their evening run in the park</p>
<p>they&rsquo;d be approached from behind</p>
<p>the person would</p>
<p>get them behind some bushes or kind of like in a little</p>
<p>secluded area</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s where they</p>
<p>would be assaulted</p>
<p>his victims were forced to perform</p>
<p>oral intercourse sodomy</p>
<p>and were sometimes beaten</p>
<p>afterwards it was</p>
<p>pretty intense and</p>
<p>pretty freaking scary</p>
<p>the first reports that were made</p>
<p>about this predator were just</p>
<p>not that it this is like not as bad it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>still bad but it was just</p>
<p>about a man groping the victims</p>
<p>but then after</p>
<p>about a year went by was</p>
<p>still no suspect in custody</p>
<p>the attacks turned more violent</p>
<p>um the media gave this person the name the scarborough</p>
<p>rapist everybody in the city was just on high alert</p>
<p>many statements were made from witnesses</p>
<p>and the victims</p>
<p>but the police</p>
<p>could not seem</p>
<p>to get an accurate description of who this person was</p>
<p>because the</p>
<p>women had been</p>
<p>attacked from behind they really didn&rsquo;t get a</p>
<p>clear shot of</p>
<p>their attacker&rsquo;s face</p>
<p>all that they</p>
<p>could tell was that whoever this guy was</p>
<p>was a guy for</p>
<p>starters he was</p>
<p>young he was good looking and he had</p>
<p>light colored hair</p>
<p>so that didn&rsquo;t really narrow it down too much but</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what they had to work with</p>
<p>now as time went on</p>
<p>police were able to collect about</p>
<p>a hundred different dna</p>
<p>samples from potential suspects but</p>
<p>so far like nothing was a match</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when</p>
<p>the toronto police had called in an fbi profiler</p>
<p>to help create a profile of who this guy was</p>
<p>so the profiler</p>
<p>analyzed the police reports</p>
<p>and was able to link</p>
<p>four more attacks to the</p>
<p>scarborough</p>
<p>rapist i&rsquo;m so</p>
<p>sorry i keep butchering this name i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>trying my best</p>
<p>but they linked four more attacks to this person</p>
<p>which brought the</p>
<p>total to eleven</p>
<p>victims so the fbi</p>
<p>analyst determined that the attacks were</p>
<p>anger based</p>
<p>and sadistic in nature</p>
<p>which was like a rare combination</p>
<p>but whoever this person was was very dangerous</p>
<p>now the profiler</p>
<p>they felt that this was a high functioning intelligent</p>
<p>psychopathic</p>
<p>sexually sadistic offender</p>
<p>and they believe that whoever it was</p>
<p>lived in the area most likely</p>
<p>in a family household</p>
<p>had to be in</p>
<p>their early 20s</p>
<p>and had to have violent relationships with</p>
<p>women so again</p>
<p>when paul and carla</p>
<p>first met in the fall of 1987</p>
<p>there had already been</p>
<p>three attacks linked to the scarborough rapist</p>
<p>now carla she</p>
<p>never suspected</p>
<p>paul could be the one linked to these</p>
<p>crimes because</p>
<p>their relationship seemed</p>
<p>picture perfect</p>
<p>paul would show up with flowers and he</p>
<p>would do this pretty often</p>
<p>he would give her</p>
<p>gifts at every chance he could</p>
<p>and he just</p>
<p>treated her really well</p>
<p>always thinking of carla</p>
<p>and just expressing how he wanted to</p>
<p>just be with her forever and take care of her</p>
<p>their relationship seemed to move</p>
<p>quickly but they were</p>
<p>infatuated with one another and they just couldn&rsquo;t keep</p>
<p>their hands off of each</p>
<p>other so they had been dating for over 18</p>
<p>months and paul</p>
<p>would drive over 80</p>
<p>miles to st catharines</p>
<p>to visit carlos several times a week</p>
<p>now carla&rsquo;s family they</p>
<p>they loved paul it was said</p>
<p>that they loved paul</p>
<p>they thought he was a</p>
<p>great catch he was well educated</p>
<p>um he was handsome</p>
<p>his life was on the</p>
<p>right track</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t mind the</p>
<p>age difference</p>
<p>between the two they just thought</p>
<p>he was great</p>
<p>it sucks this is a side note</p>
<p>i think a lot of us have this</p>
<p>image of what we</p>
<p>think these</p>
<p>awful people look like</p>
<p>right we just think of</p>
<p>these monsters</p>
<p>these atrocious beings</p>
<p>right like ugh</p>
<p>but we need to get out of our heads that</p>
<p>these sickos look like</p>
<p>monsters they don&rsquo;t look like</p>
<p>monsters they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>attractive normal</p>
<p>you would never</p>
<p>guess type of people so</p>
<p>yeah i don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>know what to do with that information though because it</p>
<p>sounded like there was no red flags with this guy</p>
<p>well yes there was i</p>
<p>think they were being okay we continue</p>
<p>in the spring of 1989 carla</p>
<p>graduated from high school</p>
<p>and was really now trying to plan what the next</p>
<p>chapter in her life was you know but when it came to</p>
<p>carla and paul like</p>
<p>their relationship</p>
<p>it went from carla telling her friends that you know</p>
<p>everything was</p>
<p>great and perfect</p>
<p>to now carla</p>
<p>telling her friends that paul was</p>
<p>becoming verbally abusive towards her</p>
<p>but soon after they</p>
<p>would have an argument carla</p>
<p>would forgive paul</p>
<p>and apologize for his</p>
<p>wrongdoings he</p>
<p>would maybe show up with a gift to show he was</p>
<p>sorry and then they would just</p>
<p>move on yeah so</p>
<p>things just kind of</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re changing</p>
<p>in december of 1989</p>
<p>paul and carla</p>
<p>they went on a romantic getaway to the niagara falls</p>
<p>and that is where</p>
<p>paul got on one knee and proposed to carla</p>
<p>and she said yes</p>
<p>so carla went back home like all excited</p>
<p>and told her parents</p>
<p>that they were engaged</p>
<p>and the parents were thrilled</p>
<p>cause now they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>gonna have paul like</p>
<p>their son in law</p>
<p>and he was such a</p>
<p>dream to them</p>
<p>at that time</p>
<p>so paul and carla decided to set</p>
<p>their wedding date</p>
<p>for the spring of nineteen ninety one</p>
<p>on may twenty</p>
<p>ninth nineteen ninety police released a</p>
<p>sketch of what they believe the scarborough</p>
<p>rapist look like</p>
<p>to the public</p>
<p>now when the</p>
<p>sketch was released it was on the</p>
<p>front pages of the papers</p>
<p>and so everybody was seeing it right</p>
<p>so friends of paul pernardo were like hey</p>
<p>have you seen this like it kind of looks like</p>
<p>paul a little bit if you squint</p>
<p>like it looks like paul</p>
<p>with this information</p>
<p>one of paul&rsquo;s best friends actually</p>
<p>contacted toronto police</p>
<p>and said that the drawing looked just like</p>
<p>his friend paul bernardo so they make a note of this</p>
<p>and then by november of</p>
<p>1990 so a couple</p>
<p>months ago by</p>
<p>there were several people who had contacted police</p>
<p>saying that the</p>
<p>sketch looked just like</p>
<p>paul bernardo</p>
<p>so with this information the police find paul</p>
<p>they bring them in for questioning</p>
<p>and then they ask if they can get a dna</p>
<p>sample from him</p>
<p>which paul willingly</p>
<p>gave them the dna was sent over to be tested</p>
<p>but at this time they had hundreds upon hundreds</p>
<p>of dna samples waiting to be tested</p>
<p>so it sat on a shelf</p>
<p>with all the</p>
<p>other ones just waiting for its turn</p>
<p>a very very</p>
<p>unfortunate move</p>
<p>now it was said that at this time dna</p>
<p>testing was</p>
<p>still somewhat</p>
<p>new and the</p>
<p>technology was just a lot slower than it is today</p>
<p>so going through all of the dna was</p>
<p>gonna take some time</p>
<p>and it did take some goddamn time</p>
<p>way too much time so</p>
<p>after paul was questioned i don&rsquo;t know if he got</p>
<p>freaked out or he just didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>he didn&rsquo;t care</p>
<p>but he decided to move from scarborough</p>
<p>to st catherine&rsquo;s to live with carla and her family and</p>
<p>now they thought carla and paul thought it</p>
<p>would be best to move in</p>
<p>with carla&rsquo;s family because then they could save</p>
<p>money and then</p>
<p>once they had enough</p>
<p>money they could get a</p>
<p>place of their own</p>
<p>but it was kind of</p>
<p>funny because after paul</p>
<p>moved all of a</p>
<p>sudden all the</p>
<p>crimes stopped happening in scarborough and</p>
<p>seemed to pick up around</p>
<p>saint catherine&rsquo;s</p>
<p>the family really did not</p>
<p>think paul could be</p>
<p>related to these</p>
<p>crimes in any way</p>
<p>they just really adored him</p>
<p>especially carla&rsquo;s younger</p>
<p>sister 15 year old</p>
<p>tammy she looked up to paul as like</p>
<p>the older brother she</p>
<p>never had paul was developing very dark</p>
<p>urges towards</p>
<p>carla&rsquo;s younger</p>
<p>sister tammy</p>
<p>it was said that you know he</p>
<p>would watch her undress from time to time all creepily</p>
<p>when she was unaware</p>
<p>so paul gave into his</p>
<p>urges and he told carla that</p>
<p>he really wanted something that carla couldn&rsquo;t give him</p>
<p>and that thing was a virgin</p>
<p>he made carla</p>
<p>feel bad because you know she wasn&rsquo;t a virgin</p>
<p>but the closest</p>
<p>thing to carla&rsquo;s virginity</p>
<p>would be her younger sister</p>
<p>tammy&rsquo;s virginity</p>
<p>so paul pressured</p>
<p>carla to let him have her virginity</p>
<p>and carla said that she wanted to please paul or he</p>
<p>would he would</p>
<p>leave her so</p>
<p>she and paul came up with a plan to</p>
<p>drug her younger</p>
<p>sister so paul</p>
<p>could have sex with her</p>
<p>yeah yep yeah</p>
<p>i told you the</p>
<p>story is disturbing okay</p>
<p>now this would be carla&rsquo;s christmas present to paul</p>
<p>okay so december 23rd</p>
<p>1990 carla&rsquo;s family went to bed</p>
<p>but carla and paul they asked tammy to stay up</p>
<p>and they could sneak some alcoholic beverages together</p>
<p>while everyone was asleep</p>
<p>so carla made the</p>
<p>drinks for everybody</p>
<p>she would end up</p>
<p>crushing up pills to put in tammy&rsquo;s drink</p>
<p>now at this time</p>
<p>carla was working at a</p>
<p>veterinarian clinic</p>
<p>and she stole animal tranquilizers from there to use on</p>
<p>tammy now these pills</p>
<p>would knock anyone out</p>
<p>and karla thought like it</p>
<p>would be best to use these to keep her sister asleep</p>
<p>while paul raped her karla also soaked a rag in</p>
<p>halithane which is a general anaesthetic</p>
<p>she held it over her sister&rsquo;s face</p>
<p>while paul raped her they also busted out a</p>
<p>video camera and recorded the entire thing</p>
<p>you know for christmas memories</p>
<p>sick now when paul was done</p>
<p>he told carla</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s your turn your turn to assault your sister</p>
<p>which she did</p>
<p>and they also recorded on tape</p>
<p>now soon after</p>
<p>tammy began to</p>
<p>vomit and then she started to choke</p>
<p>so paul and carla they&rsquo;re kinda</p>
<p>freaking out they quickly</p>
<p>dress her they hide the camera</p>
<p>and then they call an ambulance</p>
<p>so when the</p>
<p>paramedics arrive paul and carla told them that they</p>
<p>tried to revive</p>
<p>tammy after she passed out from</p>
<p>drinking but like</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>tammy ended up being</p>
<p>taken to the hospital</p>
<p>where she was</p>
<p>later pronounced dead</p>
<p>so one of the doctors that was examining</p>
<p>tammy noticed</p>
<p>a burn around her</p>
<p>mouth um where</p>
<p>carla was holding the hallow</p>
<p>thing soaked rag</p>
<p>she had like a burn around her mouth</p>
<p>carla and paul said that</p>
<p>it was rug burn on her face when they pulled her</p>
<p>they pulled her off the bed onto the</p>
<p>floor they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>trying to revive her she she got rug burn on her face</p>
<p>and like that was a good enough answer for them</p>
<p>it was concluded that</p>
<p>tammy died of natural</p>
<p>causes at 15</p>
<p>she died of natural causes</p>
<p>so that makes sense</p>
<p>carla&rsquo;s parents were devastated</p>
<p>but they honestly thought that her</p>
<p>death was just a</p>
<p>tragic accident</p>
<p>teenagers you know they just</p>
<p>experiment with drugs and alcohol so like</p>
<p>tammy must have just been</p>
<p>experimenting and she just took it too far</p>
<p>and it was like nothing more than that</p>
<p>which is just awful</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so sad</p>
<p>so a month goes by</p>
<p>carla and paul have</p>
<p>saved enough</p>
<p>money to get their own</p>
<p>place it&rsquo;s a two</p>
<p>story home in port delhuzzi</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a small town near st catharines</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a cute little house too</p>
<p>well since been</p>
<p>knocked down but it was a cute house</p>
<p>that they just ruined</p>
<p>so when the two</p>
<p>moved into their own</p>
<p>place it said that&rsquo;s when paul&rsquo;s</p>
<p>abuse really went up a notch</p>
<p>he would jokingly tell carla that he was a scarborough</p>
<p>rapist and went from just being</p>
<p>verbally abusive</p>
<p>which is still</p>
<p>awful to now physically abusive towards carla</p>
<p>now when carla</p>
<p>would tell paul</p>
<p>that she was leaving him or she wanted to leave</p>
<p>he would threaten her saying that he was</p>
<p>gonna go to police and tell them</p>
<p>about her involvements in</p>
<p>tammy&rsquo;s death</p>
<p>you know and he had the</p>
<p>video tapes to prove it</p>
<p>so if he was</p>
<p>gonna go down she was</p>
<p>gonna go down too</p>
<p>carla said that she felt like she really</p>
<p>couldn&rsquo;t leave</p>
<p>june 15 1991</p>
<p>two weeks before carla</p>
<p>and paul&rsquo;s wedding</p>
<p>paul came home with a surprise for carla</p>
<p>now you would</p>
<p>think like flowers or something but no</p>
<p>of course not</p>
<p>paul came home</p>
<p>with a 14 year old girl</p>
<p>named leslie mahaffey</p>
<p>paul said that</p>
<p>leslie was in her own backyard and</p>
<p>he pulled up in his car he offered the girl a cigarette</p>
<p>which was back in his car</p>
<p>and when she</p>
<p>approached the car she got in and then he kidnapped her</p>
<p>carla and paul</p>
<p>ended up holding her captive in their home</p>
<p>assaulting her repeatedly all</p>
<p>while recording the tax on</p>
<p>videotape so</p>
<p>after holding her captive for</p>
<p>about 24 hours the couple</p>
<p>ended up strangling her then dismembering her body</p>
<p>they took different parts</p>
<p>of her body</p>
<p>and they like</p>
<p>mixed it in with concrete blocks</p>
<p>then they dumped it into the local lake</p>
<p>lake gibson</p>
<p>they dumped it in there</p>
<p>on july 29th 1991</p>
<p>carla and paul that&rsquo;s when they got</p>
<p>married in a ceremony</p>
<p>with over a hundred friends and family around</p>
<p>to celebrate</p>
<p>their special day but</p>
<p>on that very same day a fisherman came across</p>
<p>some of the body parts of the 14 year old victim</p>
<p>leslie mahaffey</p>
<p>and the lake</p>
<p>it was all over the news</p>
<p>people were just like</p>
<p>in the community</p>
<p>were just horrified like</p>
<p>it was it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>i mean it is like such a</p>
<p>brutal what the heck</p>
<p>so it was just everywhere</p>
<p>so over the next year police looked for any clues into</p>
<p>who the teenagers killer could be</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when they brought in the same fbi profiler</p>
<p>from scarborough</p>
<p>rapist case</p>
<p>now at the time the fbi profiler he said</p>
<p>he had no reason to connect the two cases</p>
<p>which sounds</p>
<p>absolutely ridiculous</p>
<p>but he didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>so there was no</p>
<p>connection being made between the two</p>
<p>and they didn&rsquo;t really have any leads either</p>
<p>so time went on and</p>
<p>you know paul and carla&rsquo;s</p>
<p>life continued</p>
<p>as newlyweds</p>
<p>but of course like paul was just</p>
<p>probably i don&rsquo;t really know</p>
<p>cause you know i don&rsquo;t know but i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>assuming he was probably</p>
<p>getting cocky because he&rsquo;s like getting away with this</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s just wanting more he&rsquo;s wanting more</p>
<p>cause he feels like he can get</p>
<p>away with it because he is getting away with it so paul</p>
<p>asked carla to get in</p>
<p>touch with some of</p>
<p>her sisters</p>
<p>tammy&rsquo;s best friends</p>
<p>he was like hey get them on the phone</p>
<p>invite them over have them come over to the house</p>
<p>where then we can drug them the same way that we did to</p>
<p>tammy so over the next year carla</p>
<p>actually was able to get several</p>
<p>young women to go over</p>
<p>to not even</p>
<p>young women</p>
<p>young girls</p>
<p>to come over to the home</p>
<p>and hang out where they</p>
<p>would then drug and sexually assault them now</p>
<p>these victims</p>
<p>would survive</p>
<p>their attacks</p>
<p>they would wake up the next day having</p>
<p>no memory of the</p>
<p>night before</p>
<p>or of the assaults some of</p>
<p>these attacks were also caught on</p>
<p>videotape or they</p>
<p>videotaped it</p>
<p>and it was captain paul&rsquo;s</p>
<p>growing collection</p>
<p>april 16th 1992</p>
<p>paul and carla went on a</p>
<p>drive on an afternoon cruise</p>
<p>but only with the intention of</p>
<p>bringing home a new sex</p>
<p>slave to keep</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when they spotted</p>
<p>15 year old kristin french</p>
<p>she was walking home from</p>
<p>school they</p>
<p>drive past her</p>
<p>and they pull into a church parking lot</p>
<p>like it was a little ways</p>
<p>ahead of her</p>
<p>and then they were just waiting for her to walk by</p>
<p>carla was sitting in the passenger</p>
<p>seat and she called out to christian asking like hey</p>
<p>can you help us with directions because like we&rsquo;re lost</p>
<p>and carla was holding a map so it just it seemed legit</p>
<p>she walks up to the car and then that&rsquo;s when kristen</p>
<p>was shoved into the car</p>
<p>and then the couple</p>
<p>drove off heading back to</p>
<p>their house</p>
<p>now it wasn&rsquo;t long</p>
<p>until kristen</p>
<p>was reported</p>
<p>missing and then many witnesses</p>
<p>came forward</p>
<p>saying that they saw kristen</p>
<p>in the church parking lot</p>
<p>and she was</p>
<p>talking to a car that had two people inside of it</p>
<p>the witnesses</p>
<p>also reported seeing them</p>
<p>drive away in a beige camaro</p>
<p>so now that they had a description of the car</p>
<p>police started</p>
<p>searching heavily</p>
<p>for a beige camaro</p>
<p>now there were</p>
<p>tons of billboards put up or posted around</p>
<p>saying have you seen this car</p>
<p>have you seen this car</p>
<p>and then on the billboard there was a</p>
<p>picture of the beige camaro</p>
<p>but what they didn&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>was that the eyewitness reports were actually incorrect</p>
<p>paul actually</p>
<p>drove a gold</p>
<p>colored nissan</p>
<p>not a camaro</p>
<p>i could see the confusion how that</p>
<p>could happen</p>
<p>but it still wasted a lot</p>
<p>of time because they were looking for a beige camaro</p>
<p>and you know it wasn&rsquo;t a camaro was any song</p>
<p>so the media</p>
<p>started linking</p>
<p>the disappearance of chris and french to the murder of</p>
<p>leslie mahaffey</p>
<p>they were just like hey</p>
<p>these things</p>
<p>gotta be linked right</p>
<p>now the fbi profiler</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m laughing because like</p>
<p>you just think he</p>
<p>would have made this</p>
<p>connection but he didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>the fbi profiler</p>
<p>described the suspect as being a</p>
<p>white male in</p>
<p>their late twenties</p>
<p>probably had a history of</p>
<p>sexually violent</p>
<p>crimes a history of domestic violence</p>
<p>someone who was most likely violent in</p>
<p>their personal relationships</p>
<p>kind of like the scarborough</p>
<p>rapist but still no</p>
<p>connection was being made</p>
<p>paul and carla</p>
<p>ended up keeping kristen</p>
<p>french for several</p>
<p>several days</p>
<p>they videotaped</p>
<p>her assaults</p>
<p>just to add to</p>
<p>their growing collection</p>
<p>and then when</p>
<p>paul was satisfied that&rsquo;s when they strangled and</p>
<p>they killed her</p>
<p>on april 30th 1992</p>
<p>kristen&rsquo;s body was</p>
<p>found more than 30</p>
<p>miles away in burlington</p>
<p>and it was left in a</p>
<p>ditch not far from the</p>
<p>local cemetery</p>
<p>just all around</p>
<p>awful and then</p>
<p>in january of 1993</p>
<p>paul ended up beating carla up</p>
<p>like so bad to the</p>
<p>point that she went to the</p>
<p>local emergency room to receive</p>
<p>treatment paul had attacked her with</p>
<p>a torch and he</p>
<p>ended up giving her two really bad like</p>
<p>black eyes a broken rib</p>
<p>and severe bruising</p>
<p>after two years of</p>
<p>marriage it was at this</p>
<p>point that carla decided</p>
<p>to leave paul</p>
<p>now around this same time</p>
<p>finally paul&rsquo;s</p>
<p>dna was being submitted and tested for the scarborough</p>
<p>rapist case</p>
<p>his dna was positively</p>
<p>identified as the man responsible for</p>
<p>these attacks so police</p>
<p>finally are connecting the two</p>
<p>the murders in st catharines</p>
<p>they finally had</p>
<p>their person</p>
<p>so before going straight to paul</p>
<p>police actually they</p>
<p>reach out to carla</p>
<p>and they wanted to like create a</p>
<p>wedge in the relationship</p>
<p>knowing that they</p>
<p>could probably get more information from carla</p>
<p>now carla thought</p>
<p>that she was being called into question</p>
<p>to be questioned</p>
<p>about the domestic assault</p>
<p>but after the interview with police</p>
<p>carla went back to her family home and she ended up</p>
<p>breaking down</p>
<p>she confessed</p>
<p>to everything</p>
<p>carla was afraid</p>
<p>that the police they already knew what she</p>
<p>what she was involved with</p>
<p>or at least the police were</p>
<p>close to uncovering the truth</p>
<p>and she wanted to tell her parents before</p>
<p>you know shit hit the fan</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m sure her parents were like devastated</p>
<p>i mean i don&rsquo;t even know i don&rsquo;t even know but</p>
<p>her parents suggested that she hired a lawyer</p>
<p>which carla</p>
<p>ended up doing</p>
<p>so she told</p>
<p>her lawyer that paul was indeed the scarporough</p>
<p>rapist and also</p>
<p>admitted to being involved in the two</p>
<p>local murders</p>
<p>and the death of her own</p>
<p>sister carla</p>
<p>would end up</p>
<p>agreeing to testify</p>
<p>against paul in court</p>
<p>in exchange for a reduced sentence</p>
<p>for herself so police end up</p>
<p>agreeing to this</p>
<p>and then carla</p>
<p>sits down with police and gives them a full</p>
<p>confession the</p>
<p>great debate</p>
<p>around this</p>
<p>well there&rsquo;s a lot of</p>
<p>great debates around this</p>
<p>story but one of them is like carla&rsquo;s involvement okay</p>
<p>she told police you know that</p>
<p>she was a victim and</p>
<p>stuff and paul</p>
<p>like forced her to do this and what not</p>
<p>i saw clips</p>
<p>of her being questioned by police and let me just say</p>
<p>i think she&rsquo;s like new</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s a little</p>
<p>smarter than she let on</p>
<p>because when she goes to like</p>
<p>be questioned by police</p>
<p>first of all she&rsquo;s</p>
<p>dressed like a very innocent little</p>
<p>school girl</p>
<p>okay which is fine like that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s fine</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s not normally how she won</p>
<p>dress okay so she</p>
<p>was trying to play up this like i&rsquo;m so innocent thing</p>
<p>and then she</p>
<p>would answer</p>
<p>all of her questions just very like very innocent</p>
<p>she like then he</p>
<p>chopped her up</p>
<p>and i just was so scared</p>
<p>yeah so i was just there</p>
<p>like that&rsquo;s how she talks the</p>
<p>whole time okay so</p>
<p>after paul gets arrested</p>
<p>which i&rsquo;m kind of jumping here but pockets arrested</p>
<p>and then they</p>
<p>asked carla to go around</p>
<p>their house</p>
<p>and show like</p>
<p>where paul did</p>
<p>things at like describe in detail</p>
<p>where things took place</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not kidding she takes them into the bathroom</p>
<p>the police and all them</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s like this is</p>
<p>where we put</p>
<p>her and then we we bathed her in the bathtub</p>
<p>and then we just remembered her</p>
<p>and then she turns around to like</p>
<p>where the kitchens not the</p>
<p>kitchen the bathroom sink and all that sad she&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>can i ask you guys something</p>
<p>where did all of my perfumes go i had a</p>
<p>bunch of perfume</p>
<p>samples in here and i&rsquo;m just wondering</p>
<p>where they all went</p>
<p>because the detectives took</p>
<p>everything and i don&rsquo;t know where my</p>
<p>stuff went and you&rsquo;re just like girl</p>
<p>read the room</p>
<p>you just talked</p>
<p>about dismembering a girl and you&rsquo;re wondering</p>
<p>where your perfumes at like it was just like</p>
<p>okay and then she</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t really</p>
<p>show a lot of emotion but then the moment she talks</p>
<p>about one of the</p>
<p>victims came over</p>
<p>paul like took out really expensive</p>
<p>um champagne</p>
<p>flutes is that what they&rsquo;re called like the</p>
<p>glasses that you put in champagne</p>
<p>and you could just see all of a</p>
<p>sudden she just her motion comes out over</p>
<p>these these</p>
<p>glasses that</p>
<p>paul decided to use to drug the girls with</p>
<p>so she was like</p>
<p>those glasses</p>
<p>they were from</p>
<p>france and they were very expensive and we</p>
<p>never used them</p>
<p>they were only for a special occasion</p>
<p>and i was so</p>
<p>mad and like she&rsquo;s getting all worked up over paul&rsquo;s</p>
<p>choice of glasses that he used</p>
<p>and like that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>one of the only times you see her like getting</p>
<p>worked up over something and you&rsquo;re like okay girl</p>
<p>this isn&rsquo;t make okay</p>
<p>okay and then like it just keeps happening</p>
<p>because then she&rsquo;s like describing</p>
<p>again like what&rsquo;s what happened and then she&rsquo;s like</p>
<p>can i ask you something</p>
<p>do you know</p>
<p>where all of my furniture</p>
<p>went because they just came and they took all of the</p>
<p>furniture and i&rsquo;m just wondering</p>
<p>where they went with my</p>
<p>furniture can i get it back</p>
<p>do you not understand like what&rsquo;s</p>
<p>happening right now like</p>
<p>hello and then another one</p>
<p>they were in like the basement she sees a book</p>
<p>on the ground she goes</p>
<p>excuse me can i have this book because my</p>
<p>sister really wants it she&rsquo;s been asking</p>
<p>about this book and i&rsquo;m just wondering if i</p>
<p>could take this book</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s like the only time that you get</p>
<p>these little snippets of like hmm</p>
<p>hmm hmm hmm</p>
<p>huh so carla kept telling police</p>
<p>that paul forced her</p>
<p>to participate in all of the attacks</p>
<p>against her will carla also told police that there were</p>
<p>videotapes in the</p>
<p>house that would have</p>
<p>everything they needed because</p>
<p>everything was recorded so she&rsquo;s like you have to get</p>
<p>those tapes they&rsquo;re in the house</p>
<p>on february</p>
<p>seventeenth nineteen ninety three</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when paul bernardo was arrested</p>
<p>they began searching the home</p>
<p>their goal being to find</p>
<p>those tapes because that was</p>
<p>gonna be their smoking gun</p>
<p>they would end up spending</p>
<p>seventy one days</p>
<p>searching the home but the police</p>
<p>could not locate these video tapes which</p>
<p>karla claim showed the attacks</p>
<p>now without these tapes they had no direct evidence</p>
<p>that linked paul</p>
<p>to the crimes so they arranged the plea</p>
<p>agreement with karla</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re heavily relying on her to</p>
<p>give her testimony</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s gonna put paul behind bars</p>
<p>and in exchange carla</p>
<p>would receive a reduced sentence for her involvement</p>
<p>which this deal was kept</p>
<p>secret from the public and that caused</p>
<p>a whole upset</p>
<p>on june 28th 1993 carla appeared in court</p>
<p>for her involvement with the</p>
<p>crimes and the</p>
<p>court put a publication ban on her</p>
<p>trial which was very unlikely of the courts to do</p>
<p>this caused a huge upset with the</p>
<p>media and the</p>
<p>public was angered because</p>
<p>their right to know was being denied</p>
<p>and this was a really</p>
<p>really big case so people are just trying to figure out</p>
<p>what happened</p>
<p>oh and by the way i forgot to mention like</p>
<p>correct me if i&rsquo;m</p>
<p>wrong here but from my</p>
<p>understanding it was the us</p>
<p>who gave them the</p>
<p>title the ken and barbie killers like they</p>
<p>would you know</p>
<p>because of their good looks</p>
<p>like oh my god they&rsquo;re so good looking how</p>
<p>could they be killers</p>
<p>so carla was convicted</p>
<p>on manslaughter</p>
<p>charges and she</p>
<p>ended up receiving a 12 year sentence</p>
<p>which again</p>
<p>caused a lot of</p>
<p>upset the plea</p>
<p>agreement was said to be kept a</p>
<p>secret in order to make sure that paul had a fair trial</p>
<p>so carla was sent to prison</p>
<p>and then on august 2</p>
<p>1993 she ended up filing for divorce from</p>
<p>paul on may 18 1995</p>
<p>paul&rsquo;s trial</p>
<p>began paul pleaded not guilty</p>
<p>on nine charges and</p>
<p>connections with the</p>
<p>deaths of leslie and kristen</p>
<p>including kidnapping</p>
<p>unlawful confinement aggravated</p>
<p>sexual assault</p>
<p>and murder the prosecutors had</p>
<p>presented new evidence during</p>
<p>trial that was not</p>
<p>known about</p>
<p>they ended up finding the</p>
<p>videotapes in the couple&rsquo;s home</p>
<p>i know it was</p>
<p>kinda like a surprise i don&rsquo;t know where they</p>
<p>found it or like</p>
<p>where i don&rsquo;t know i didn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>they found it though i</p>
<p>think that&rsquo;s great</p>
<p>now this was the</p>
<p>first time that they had</p>
<p>direct evidence</p>
<p>against paul but also</p>
<p>carla as well</p>
<p>now these tapes revealed a</p>
<p>completely different version of events</p>
<p>and they felt that carla had</p>
<p>completely misled</p>
<p>authorities</p>
<p>because on the tapes carla was seen</p>
<p>fully participating</p>
<p>in the attacks had the tape surfaced</p>
<p>sooner or earlier</p>
<p>it most likely</p>
<p>would have affected her plea</p>
<p>deal so paul&rsquo;s team was like ah shit like</p>
<p>but they got the tapes you know but they&rsquo;re like</p>
<p>yeah paul&rsquo;s on the tapes but they</p>
<p>never show him murdering anyone you know</p>
<p>paul instead was like it wasn&rsquo;t me who murdered</p>
<p>them i was not the killer it was actually carla</p>
<p>who murdered the victims</p>
<p>on june 19 1995</p>
<p>carla testified</p>
<p>against paul</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s where she stated that she was also a</p>
<p>victim to paul</p>
<p>and he was the mastermind</p>
<p>behind it all</p>
<p>when carla was</p>
<p>asked about the</p>
<p>video tapes</p>
<p>she said that she suffered from battered</p>
<p>spouse syndrome</p>
<p>and that was her reasoning many</p>
<p>believe that yes she was indeed abused by paul but she</p>
<p>could not be</p>
<p>classified as</p>
<p>a person suffering from battered</p>
<p>spouse syndrome</p>
<p>when talking</p>
<p>about battered</p>
<p>spouse syndrome</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re mainly talking</p>
<p>about people who are</p>
<p>suffering from tremendous</p>
<p>psychological abuse</p>
<p>these tapes showed</p>
<p>that carla was more of an accomplice in the horrible</p>
<p>crimes versus</p>
<p>a victim the</p>
<p>judge allowed the jurors</p>
<p>to watch the</p>
<p>videotapes and only</p>
<p>allowed the public to listen to them but not view it</p>
<p>they didn&rsquo;t want to put the family through more</p>
<p>grief by viewing</p>
<p>these tapes because of just how</p>
<p>awful they were</p>
<p>pulse trial lasted</p>
<p>months at the end of it</p>
<p>the jury deliberated for five hours</p>
<p>then on september 1st 1995</p>
<p>31 year old paul bernardo was</p>
<p>found guilty</p>
<p>of all nine charges</p>
<p>against him</p>
<p>including the two murders</p>
<p>paul was sentenced to life in prison</p>
<p>while paul is sitting in prison</p>
<p>he also confessed to 14</p>
<p>more sexual assaults of</p>
<p>women in the scarborough area</p>
<p>and the judge</p>
<p>declared him</p>
<p>just a dangerous offender</p>
<p>which will most likely keep him in prison</p>
<p>without the chance of parole</p>
<p>for the rest of his life</p>
<p>cause he does have a possibility of parole</p>
<p>after like 25 years i believe</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s hope that he does not get out because it</p>
<p>sounds like</p>
<p>he would do it again</p>
<p>like come on</p>
<p>so the great debate around this case</p>
<p>was if carla got off way too easily</p>
<p>many believe that carla was just as sick</p>
<p>if not more sick than paul was</p>
<p>now whatever was on</p>
<p>these tapes showed a</p>
<p>completely different</p>
<p>side of carla but also just a different</p>
<p>story i didn&rsquo;t see them</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>to see them so i didn&rsquo;t look it up but just</p>
<p>based off of what i was hearing</p>
<p>from interviews with the police department and</p>
<p>stuff and jurors</p>
<p>it was really bad</p>
<p>carla seemed</p>
<p>thrilled to be there</p>
<p>do you know what i&rsquo;m saying</p>
<p>carla&rsquo;s plea</p>
<p>deal became</p>
<p>known as one of the</p>
<p>worst in a canadian history</p>
<p>the following year an investigation was done</p>
<p>on the investigation into paul</p>
<p>and carla&rsquo;s case as to why they fell through the cracks</p>
<p>and how this could</p>
<p>be prevented in the future</p>
<p>i guess since then</p>
<p>they have tried to</p>
<p>implement a new</p>
<p>system for tracking serial predators</p>
<p>improving communication between police departments</p>
<p>and hoping to</p>
<p>never have a</p>
<p>case like this go unsolved for as long as it did</p>
<p>so then on july 4th</p>
<p>2005 35 year old carla</p>
<p>was released from prison</p>
<p>having served just 12 years behind bars</p>
<p>now carla couldn&rsquo;t go back to st catharines</p>
<p>okay she was not welcome there so instead she</p>
<p>moved to montreal and</p>
<p>started a new life there</p>
<p>carla said that she</p>
<p>still had nightmares</p>
<p>about the girls and felt</p>
<p>great remorse</p>
<p>for what she did</p>
<p>and then she also went to the</p>
<p>courts and hopes to get a name change</p>
<p>but she was denied the right</p>
<p>changing her name</p>
<p>because she</p>
<p>is a public figure so</p>
<p>she wasn&rsquo;t allowed to do that</p>
<p>so over the years she remarried and she went on to have</p>
<p>three kids of her own</p>
<p>from what i</p>
<p>could find as of 2020</p>
<p>it was said that she no longer lives with her children</p>
<p>or husband and there was a period of time</p>
<p>where she was like a volunteer at</p>
<p>a primary school</p>
<p>and like that</p>
<p>caused obviously</p>
<p>a lot of outrage because she was working with kids or</p>
<p>young adults</p>
<p>and like nobody did a</p>
<p>background check and</p>
<p>maybe thought</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not a good fit</p>
<p>it seems like wherever she goes</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s just not welcome</p>
<p>anywhere she goes</p>
<p>i mean for a good reason</p>
<p>i personally believe that carla yeah she</p>
<p>should have been locked up for a lot longer</p>
<p>okay and like even</p>
<p>cause okay so i went to the</p>
<p>museum of death in los angeles</p>
<p>and they have</p>
<p>their personal</p>
<p>photos there</p>
<p>on display you can go there and oh it&rsquo;s just</p>
<p>be prepared you go there and they have all the</p>
<p>photos and this was like before i really even knew much</p>
<p>about the case but this</p>
<p>image has been burned into my brain</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s carla like smiling all big and</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s holding up she&rsquo;s like holding up someone&rsquo;s head</p>
<p>she&rsquo;s like she just was</p>
<p>excited but yeah i</p>
<p>think she should have</p>
<p>spent a lot more time behind bars</p>
<p>i mean she killed her own damn</p>
<p>sister the hell i forgot</p>
<p>about that yeah girl no</p>
<p>no no mmm out out</p>
<p>go and that my friends is the</p>
<p>awful story</p>
<p>about paul bernardo and carla homolka</p>
<p>um thank you for recommending this</p>
<p>awful story you</p>
<p>happy do you</p>
<p>think that carla</p>
<p>should be in prison for a lot longer that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>hot debates</p>
<p>love and appreciate you guys i hope you have a</p>
<p>great day you make good choices</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;ll be</p>
<p>seeing you guys later bye</p>
