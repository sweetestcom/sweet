    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>where we discuss science</p>
<p>and science-based tools for everyday life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Andrew Huberman,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology</p>
<p>at Stanford School of Medicine.</p>
<p>Today, my guest is Dr. Lex Friedman.</p>
<p>Dr. Lex Friedman is an expert</p>
<p>in electrical and computer engineering,</p>
<p>artificial intelligence, and robotics.</p>
<p>He is also the host of the Lex Friedman Podcast,</p>
<p>which initially started as a podcast</p>
<p>focused on technology and science of various kinds,</p>
<p>including computer science and physics,</p>
<p>but rapidly evolved to include guests</p>
<p>and other topics as a matter of focus, including sport.</p>
<p>For instance, Dr. Lex Friedman</p>
<p>is a black belt in Brazilian jiu-jitsu,</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s had numerous guests on</p>
<p>who come from the fields of Brazilian jiu-jitsu,</p>
<p>both from the coaching side and from the competitor side.</p>
<p>He also has shown an active interest</p>
<p>in topics such as chess,</p>
<p>and essentially anything that involves intense activation</p>
<p>and engagement of the mind and or body.</p>
<p>In fact, the Lex Friedman Podcast has evolved</p>
<p>to take on very difficult topics such as mental health.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s had various psychiatrists and other guests on</p>
<p>that relate to mental health and mental illness,</p>
<p>as well as guests focused on geopolitics</p>
<p>and some of the more controversial issues</p>
<p>that face our times.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s had comedians, he&rsquo;s had scientists, he&rsquo;s had friends,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s had enemies on his podcast.</p>
<p>Lex has a phenomenal, I would say a one in an 8 billion</p>
<p>ability to find these people, make them comfortable,</p>
<p>and in that comfort, both try to understand them</p>
<p>and to confront them and to push them so that we all learn.</p>
<p>All of which is to say that Lex Friedman</p>
<p>is no longer just an accomplished scientist.</p>
<p>He certainly is that, but he has also become</p>
<p>one of the more preeminent thought leaders on the planet.</p>
<p>And if there&rsquo;s anything that really captures the essence</p>
<p>of Lex Friedman, it&rsquo;s his love of learning,</p>
<p>his desire to share with us the human experience</p>
<p>and to broaden that experience so that we all may benefit.</p>
<p>In many ways, our discussion during today&rsquo;s episode</p>
<p>captures the many facets of Lex Friedman,</p>
<p>although no conversation of course, could capture them all.</p>
<p>We sit down to the conversation just days</p>
<p>after Lex returned from Ukraine,</p>
<p>where he deliberately placed himself into the tension</p>
<p>of that environment in order to understand</p>
<p>the geopolitics of the region and to understand</p>
<p>exactly what was happening at the level of the ground</p>
<p>and the people there.</p>
<p>You may notice that he carries quite a lot of both emotion</p>
<p>and knowledge and understanding,</p>
<p>and yet in a very classic Lex Friedman way,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll notice that he&rsquo;s able to zoom out</p>
<p>of his own experience around any number of different topics</p>
<p>and view them through a variety of lenses</p>
<p>so that first of all, everyone feel included,</p>
<p>but most of all, so that everyone learns something new.</p>
<p>That is to gain new perspective.</p>
<p>Our discussion also ventures into the waters of social media</p>
<p>and how that landscape is changing the way</p>
<p>that science and technology are communicated.</p>
<p>We also get into the topics of motivation,</p>
<p>drive and purpose, both finding it</p>
<p>and executing on that drive and purpose.</p>
<p>I should mention that this is episode 100</p>
<p>of the Huberman Lab podcast, and I would be remiss</p>
<p>if I did not tell you that there would be</p>
<p>no Huberman Lab podcast were it not for Lex Friedman.</p>
<p>I was a fan of the Lex Friedman podcast</p>
<p>long before I was ever invited on to the podcast as a guest,</p>
<p>and after our first recording,</p>
<p>Lex was the one that suggested that I start a podcast.</p>
<p>He only gave me two pieces of advice.</p>
<p>The first piece of advice was start a podcast,</p>
<p>and the second piece of advice was that I not just make it</p>
<p>me blabbing into the microphone and staring at the camera.</p>
<p>So I can safely say that I at least followed</p>
<p>half of his advice and that I am ever grateful for Lex,</p>
<p>both as a friend, a colleague in science,</p>
<p>and now fellow podcaster for making the suggestion</p>
<p>that we start this podcast.</p>
<p>I already mentioned a few of the topics</p>
<p>covered on today&rsquo;s podcast, but I can assure you</p>
<p>that there is far more to the person</p>
<p>that many of us know as Lex Friedman.</p>
<p>If you are somebody interested in artificial intelligence,</p>
<p>engineering, or robotics,</p>
<p>today&rsquo;s discussion is most certainly for you.</p>
<p>And if you are not, but you are somebody</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s interested in world politics,</p>
<p>and more importantly, the human experience,</p>
<p>both the individual and the collective human experience,</p>
<p>Lex shares what can only be described as incredible insights</p>
<p>into what he views as the human experience</p>
<p>and what is optimal in order to derive</p>
<p>from our time on this planet.</p>
<p>Before we begin, I&rsquo;d like to emphasize that this podcast</p>
<p>is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.</p>
<p>It is, however, part of my desire and effort</p>
<p>to bring zero cost to consumer information about science</p>
<p>and science-related tools to the general public.</p>
<p>In keeping with that theme,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank the sponsors of today&rsquo;s podcast.</p>
<p>Our first sponsor is Element.</p>
<p>Element is an electrolyte drink with everything you need</p>
<p>and nothing you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>That means plenty of salt, magnesium, and potassium,</p>
<p>the so-called electrolytes, and no sugar.</p>
<p>Now, salt, magnesium, and potassium are critical</p>
<p>to the function of all the cells in your body,</p>
<p>in particular, to the function of your nerve cells,</p>
<p>also called neurons.</p>
<p>In fact, in order for your neurons to function properly,</p>
<p>all three electrolytes need to be present</p>
<p>in the proper ratios.</p>
<p>And we now know that even slight reductions</p>
<p>in electrolyte concentrations or dehydration of the body</p>
<p>can lead to deficits in cognitive and physical performance.</p>
<p>Element contains a science-backed electrolyte ratio</p>
<p>of 1,000 milligrams, that&rsquo;s one gram, of sodium,</p>
<p>200 milligrams of potassium,</p>
<p>and 60 milligrams of magnesium.</p>
<p>I typically drink Element first thing in the morning</p>
<p>when I wake up in order to hydrate my body</p>
<p>and make sure I have enough electrolytes.</p>
<p>And while I do any kind of physical training</p>
<p>and after physical training as well,</p>
<p>especially if I&rsquo;ve been sweating a lot,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;d like to try Element,</p>
<p>you can go to drinkelement, that&rsquo;s lmnt.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>to claim a free Element sample pack with your purchase.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s drinkelement, lmnt.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Thesis.</p>
<p>Thesis makes what are called nootropics,</p>
<p>which means smart drugs.</p>
<p>Now, to be honest, I am not a fan of the term nootropics.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe in smart drugs in the sense</p>
<p>that I don&rsquo;t believe that there&rsquo;s any one substance</p>
<p>or collection of substances that can make us smarter.</p>
<p>I do believe based on science, however,</p>
<p>that there are particular neural circuits</p>
<p>and brain functions that allow us to be more focused,</p>
<p>more alert, access creativity, be more motivated, et cetera.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just the way that the brain works,</p>
<p>different neural circuits for different brain states.</p>
<p>Thesis understands this.</p>
<p>And as far as I know, they&rsquo;re the first nootropics company</p>
<p>to create targeted nootropics for specific outcomes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Thesis for more than six months now,</p>
<p>and I can confidently say that their nootropics</p>
<p>have been a total game changer.</p>
<p>My go-to formula is the clarity formula,</p>
<p>or sometimes I&rsquo;ll use their energy formula before training.</p>
<p>To get your own personalized nootropic starter kit,</p>
<p>go online to takethesis.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>take a three-minute quiz,</p>
<p>and Thesis will send you four different formulas</p>
<p>to try in your first month.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m pleased to announce that the Huberman Lab Podcast</p>
<p>is now partnered with Momentus Supplements.</p>
<p>We partnered with Momentus for several important reasons.</p>
<p>First of all, they ship internationally</p>
<p>because we know that many of you</p>
<p>are located outside of the United States.</p>
<p>Second of all, and perhaps most important,</p>
<p>the quality of their supplements is second to none,</p>
<p>both in terms of purity and precision</p>
<p>of the amounts of the ingredients.</p>
<p>Third, we&rsquo;ve really emphasized supplements</p>
<p>that are single-ingredient supplements</p>
<p>and that are supplied in dosages</p>
<p>that allow you to build a supplementation protocol</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for cost,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for effectiveness,</p>
<p>and that you can add things</p>
<p>and remove things from your protocol</p>
<p>in a way that&rsquo;s really systematic and scientific.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to see the supplements</p>
<p>that we partner with Momentus on,</p>
<p>you can go to livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>There you&rsquo;ll see those supplements,</p>
<p>and just keep in mind that we are constantly expanding</p>
<p>the library of supplements available through Momentus</p>
<p>on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>And now for my discussion with Dr. Lex Friedman.</p>
<p>Welcome back.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s good to be back in a bedroom.</p>
<p>This feels like a porn set.</p>
<p>I apologize to open that way.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never been in a porn set,</p>
<p>so I should admit this.</p>
<p>Our studio is being renovated.</p>
<p>So here we are for the monumental recording</p>
<p>of episode 100 of the Huberman Lab podcast,</p>
<p>which was inspired by the Lex Friedman podcast.</p>
<p>Some people already know this story,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ll repeat it again for those that don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>There would not be a Huberman Lab podcast</p>
<p>were it not for Lex Friedman,</p>
<p>because after recording as a guest on his podcast</p>
<p>a few years ago,</p>
<p>he made the suggestion that I start a podcast,</p>
<p>and he explained to me how it works.</p>
<p>And he said, you should start a podcast,</p>
<p>but just make sure that it&rsquo;s not you</p>
<p>labbing the whole time, Andrew.</p>
<p>And I only sort of followed the advice.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, you surprised me, surprised the world,</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re able to talk for hours</p>
<p>and cite some of the best science going on</p>
<p>and be able to give people advice</p>
<p>without many interruptions or edits or any of that.</p>
<p>I mean, that takes an incredible amount of skill</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re probably born with</p>
<p>and some of it is developed.</p>
<p>I mean, the whole science community is proud of you, man.</p>
<p>Stanford is proud of you.</p>
<p>So yeah, it&rsquo;s a beautiful thing.</p>
<p>It was really surprising</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s unclear how a scientist can do a great podcast</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not just shooting the shit about random stuff,</p>
<p>but really is giving very structured, good advice</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s boiling down the state-of-the-art science</p>
<p>into something that&rsquo;s actually useful for people.</p>
<p>So that was impressive.</p>
<p>I was like, holy shit, he actually pulled this off.</p>
<p>And doing it every week on a different topic.</p>
<p>That, I mean, I&rsquo;m usually positive,</p>
<p>especially for people I love and support,</p>
<p>but damn, I thought there&rsquo;s no way</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s gonna be able to pull this off week after week.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s been only getting better and better and better.</p>
<p>I had a whole rant on a recent podcast,</p>
<p>I forget with who, of how awesome you are,</p>
<p>with Rana El-Khaloubi.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s a emotion recognition person, AI person.</p>
<p>And then she didn&rsquo;t know who you were.</p>
<p>And I was like, what the hell do you mean?</p>
<p>And then I just went on this whole rant</p>
<p>of how awesome you are, it was hilarious.</p>
<p>Oh, well, I&rsquo;m very gratified to hear this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little uncomfortable for me to hear,</p>
<p>but listen, I&rsquo;m just really happy</p>
<p>if people are getting information that they like</p>
<p>and can make actionable.</p>
<p>And it was inspired by you.</p>
<p>And look, right back at you,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve followed a number of your structural formats, attire.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wear a tie.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m constantly reminded about this by my father</p>
<p>who says what he saw my podcast.</p>
<p>He was like, why don&rsquo;t you dress properly</p>
<p>like your friend Lex?</p>
<p>He literally said that.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a debate that goes back and forth,</p>
<p>but nonetheless.</p>
<p>How does it feel episode 100?</p>
<p>How does it feel?</p>
<p>You know, I think-</p>
<p>Can you imagine you&rsquo;re here?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re here after so many episodes and done so much.</p>
<p>I mean, the number of hours is just insane.</p>
<p>The amount of passion, the amount of work you put into this.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s it feel like?</p>
<p>It feels great.</p>
<p>And it feels very much like the horizon is still</p>
<p>at the same distance in front of me.</p>
<p>You know, every episode,</p>
<p>I just try and get information there.</p>
<p>And the process that we talked about on your podcast,</p>
<p>we won&rsquo;t go into it, of collecting information,</p>
<p>distilling it down to some simple notes,</p>
<p>walking around, listening to music,</p>
<p>trying to, you know, figure out what the motifs are.</p>
<p>And then as just like you,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t use a teleprompter or anything like that.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s very minimal notes.</p>
<p>So it feels great and I love it.</p>
<p>And again, I&rsquo;m just grateful to you for inspiring it.</p>
<p>And I just want to keep going and do more of it.</p>
<p>And I should say,</p>
<p>I am also relieved that we&rsquo;re sitting here</p>
<p>because you recently went overseas</p>
<p>to a very intense war zone, literally, the Ukraine.</p>
<p>And the entire time that you were there,</p>
<p>I was genuinely concerned.</p>
<p>You know, the world&rsquo;s a unpredictable place in general,</p>
<p>and we don&rsquo;t always get the only vote</p>
<p>in what happens to us.</p>
<p>So first of all, welcome back safely,</p>
<p>one piece, one alive piece.</p>
<p>And what was that like?</p>
<p>I mean, at a broad level, at a specific level,</p>
<p>what drew you there?</p>
<p>What surprised you?</p>
<p>And how do you think it changed you in coming back here?</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a lot to say,</p>
<p>but first it is really good to be back.</p>
<p>One of the things that when you go</p>
<p>to a difficult part of the world</p>
<p>or a part of the world</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s going through something difficult,</p>
<p>you really appreciate how great it is to be an American.</p>
<p>Everything, the easy access to food,</p>
<p>despite what people think,</p>
<p>the stable, reliable rule of law,</p>
<p>the lack of corruption in that you can trust</p>
<p>that if you start a business</p>
<p>or if you take on various pursuits in life,</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s not going to be at scale</p>
<p>manipulation of your efforts such that you can&rsquo;t succeed.</p>
<p>So that this kind of, you know,</p>
<p>capitalism and the ideal of capitalism</p>
<p>is really still burning bright in this country.</p>
<p>And it really makes you appreciate those aspects.</p>
<p>And also just the ability to have a home</p>
<p>for generations, across generations.</p>
<p>So you can have your grandfather live in,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, Kentucky in a certain city,</p>
<p>and then his children lived there and you lived there.</p>
<p>And then it just continues on and on.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the kind of thing you can have</p>
<p>when you don&rsquo;t have war,</p>
<p>because war destroys entire communities.</p>
<p>It destroys histories, generations,</p>
<p>like life stories that stretch across the generations.</p>
<p>Yeah, I didn&rsquo;t even think about that</p>
<p>until you said just now, but photographs,</p>
<p>hard drives get destroyed or just abandoned, right?</p>
<p>Libraries.</p>
<p>I mean, nowadays things exist in the cloud,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s still a lot of material goods</p>
<p>that are irreplaceable, right?</p>
<p>Well, even in rural parts of the United States,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t exist in the cloud, right?</p>
<p>A lot of people still, well, even in towns,</p>
<p>they still love the physical photo album of your family.</p>
<p>A lot of people still store their photographs</p>
<p>of families in the VHS tapes and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Yeah, but I think there&rsquo;s so many things I&rsquo;ve learned</p>
<p>and really felt the lessons.</p>
<p>One of which is nobody gives a damn</p>
<p>when your photos are gone and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Your house is gone.</p>
<p>The thing time and time again,</p>
<p>I saw for people that lost everything</p>
<p>is how happy they are for the people.</p>
<p>They love the friends, the family that are still alive.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the only thing they talk about,</p>
<p>that in fact, they don&rsquo;t mention actually</p>
<p>with much dramatic sort of vigor</p>
<p>about the trauma of losing your home.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just nonstop saying how lucky they are</p>
<p>that person X, person Y is still here.</p>
<p>And that makes you realize that when you lose everything,</p>
<p>it makes you realize what really matters,</p>
<p>which is the people in your life.</p>
<p>I mean, a lot of people kind of realize that later in life</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re facing mortality, when you&rsquo;re facing your death,</p>
<p>or you get a cancer diagnosis, that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>I think people here in America, in California,</p>
<p>with the fires, you can still lose your home.</p>
<p>You realize like, nah, it doesn&rsquo;t really matter.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a pain in the ass,</p>
<p>but what matters is still the family, the people, and so on.</p>
<p>I think the most intense thing,</p>
<p>I talked to several hundred people,</p>
<p>some of which is recorded.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve really been struggling to put that out</p>
<p>because I have to edit it myself.</p>
<p>And so you&rsquo;re talking about 30, 40 hours of footage.</p>
<p>Is it emotionally struggling?</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s extremely difficult.</p>
<p>So I talked to a lot of politicians,</p>
<p>the number two in the country, number three.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be back there to talk to the president,</p>
<p>to do a three-hour conversation.</p>
<p>Those are easy to edit.</p>
<p>You know, they&rsquo;re really heartfelt and thoughtful folks</p>
<p>from different perspectives on the geopolitics of the war.</p>
<p>But the ones that are really hard to edit</p>
<p>is like grandmas that are like in the middle of nowhere.</p>
<p>They lost everything.</p>
<p>They still have hope.</p>
<p>They still have love.</p>
<p>And some of them have, some of them,</p>
<p>many of them unfortunately have now hate in their heart.</p>
<p>So in February, when Russia invaded Ukraine,</p>
<p>this is the thing I realized about war.</p>
<p>One of the most painful lessons</p>
<p>is that war creates generational hate.</p>
<p>You know, we sometimes think about war</p>
<p>as a thing that kills people,</p>
<p>kills civilians, kills soldiers,</p>
<p>takes away lives, injures people.</p>
<p>But we don&rsquo;t directly think about</p>
<p>the secondary and tertiary effects of that,</p>
<p>which lasts decades,</p>
<p>which is anyone who&rsquo;s lost a father or a mother</p>
<p>or a daughter or a son,</p>
<p>they now hate not just the individual soldiers</p>
<p>or the leaders that invaded their country,</p>
<p>but the entirety of the people.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not that they hate Vladimir Putin</p>
<p>or hate the Russian military.</p>
<p>They hate Russian people.</p>
<p>So that tears the fabric of a thing that,</p>
<p>for me, you know, half my family&rsquo;s from Ukraine,</p>
<p>half my family&rsquo;s from Russia.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s, I remember the pain,</p>
<p>the triumph of World War II still resonates</p>
<p>through my entire family tree.</p>
<p>And so you remember when the Russians</p>
<p>and Ukrainians fought together against this Nazi invasion.</p>
<p>You remember a lot of that.</p>
<p>And now to see the fabric of this people&rsquo;s</p>
<p>torn apart completely with hate</p>
<p>is really, really difficult for me,</p>
<p>just to realize that things will just never be the same</p>
<p>on this particular cultural historical aspect.</p>
<p>But also there&rsquo;s so many painful ways</p>
<p>in which things will never be the same,</p>
<p>which is we&rsquo;ve seen that it&rsquo;s possible</p>
<p>to have a major hot war in the 21st century.</p>
<p>I think a lot of people are watching this.</p>
<p>China is watching this.</p>
<p>India is watching this.</p>
<p>United States is watching this</p>
<p>and thinking we can actually have a large-scale war.</p>
<p>And I think the lessons learned from that</p>
<p>might be the kind that lead to a major World War III</p>
<p>in the 21st century.</p>
<p>So like one of the things I realized</p>
<p>watching the whole scene is that we don&rsquo;t know shit</p>
<p>about what&rsquo;s gonna happen in the 21st century.</p>
<p>And it might, we kind of have this intuition,</p>
<p>like surely there&rsquo;s not gonna be another war.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll just coast.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, pandemic.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Back to normal.</p>
<p>Back to normal.</p>
<p>Whatever that is.</p>
<p>But you have to remember at the end of World War I,</p>
<p>as Woodrow Wilson called it, the war to end all wars,</p>
<p>nobody, ironically, in a dark way,</p>
<p>it was also the roaring 20s when people believed this,</p>
<p>there will never be another world war.</p>
<p>And 20 years after that, the rise of Nazi Germany,</p>
<p>a charismatic leader that captivated the minds of millions</p>
<p>and built up a military that can take on the whole world.</p>
<p>And so it makes you realize that this is still possible.</p>
<p>This is still possible.</p>
<p>And then the tension, you see the media machine,</p>
<p>the propaganda machine that I&rsquo;ve gotten to see</p>
<p>every aspect of, it&rsquo;s still fueling that division</p>
<p>between America and China, between Russia and India.</p>
<p>And then Africa has a complicated thing</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s trying to figure out who are they with,</p>
<p>who are they against.</p>
<p>And just this tension is building and building.</p>
<p>And it makes you realize like we might,</p>
<p>the thing that might shake human civilization</p>
<p>may not be so far off.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a realization you get to really feel.</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s all kinds of other lessons.</p>
<p>And one of which is propaganda.</p>
<p>Is I got to, I get a lot of letters, emails,</p>
<p>and some of them are full of really intense language,</p>
<p>full of hate from every side toward me.</p>
<p>What, well, the hate is towards me as representing side X.</p>
<p>And X stands as a variable for every side.</p>
<p>So either I&rsquo;m a Zelensky show, or I&rsquo;m a Putin show,</p>
<p>or I&rsquo;m a NATO show, or I&rsquo;m an America show,</p>
<p>American empire show, or I&rsquo;m a Democrat or a Republican,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s already been in this country politicized.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a sense of Ukraine is this place</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s full of corruption.</p>
<p>Why are we sending money there?</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s kind of the messaging</p>
<p>on the Republican side, on the Democratic side.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not even keeping track of the actual messaging</p>
<p>and the conspiracy theories and the narratives,</p>
<p>but they are, the tension is there</p>
<p>and I get to feel it directly.</p>
<p>And what you get to really experience</p>
<p>is there&rsquo;s a large number of narratives</p>
<p>that all are extremely confident in themselves</p>
<p>that they know the truth.</p>
<p>People are convinced, first of all,</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re not being lied to.</p>
<p>People in Russia think there&rsquo;s no propaganda.</p>
<p>They think that, yes, yes,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s like state sponsored propaganda,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re all smart enough to ignore</p>
<p>the sort of lame propaganda that&rsquo;s everywhere.</p>
<p>They know that we can think on our own, we know the truth.</p>
<p>And everybody kind of speaks in this way.</p>
<p>In the United States says, well, yes,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s mainstream media,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re full of messaging and propaganda,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;re smart, we can think on our own.</p>
<p>Of course, we see through that.</p>
<p>Everybody says this.</p>
<p>And then the conclusion of their thought</p>
<p>is often hatred towards some group, whatever that group is.</p>
<p>And the more you&rsquo;ve lost,</p>
<p>the more intense the feeling of hatred.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a really difficult field to walk through calmly</p>
<p>and with an open mind and try to understand</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s really going on.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s super intense.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the only words that come to mind as I hear this.</p>
<p>You mentioned something that it seems that hate generalizes.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s against an entire group or an entire country.</p>
<p>Why do you think it is that hate generalizes</p>
<p>and that love may or may not generalize?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had, so one of the, as you can imagine,</p>
<p>the kind of question I asked is,</p>
<p>do you have love or hate in your heart?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a question I asked almost everybody.</p>
<p>And then I would dig into this exact question</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re asking.</p>
<p>I think some of the most beautiful things I&rsquo;ve heard,</p>
<p>which is people that are full of hate</p>
<p>are able to self introspect about it.</p>
<p>They know they shouldn&rsquo;t feel it,</p>
<p>but they can&rsquo;t help it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not, they know that ultimately the thing</p>
<p>that helps them and helps everyone</p>
<p>is to feel love for fellow man,</p>
<p>but they can&rsquo;t help it.</p>
<p>They know it&rsquo;s like a drug.</p>
<p>They say like hate escalates.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a vicious spiral.</p>
<p>You just can&rsquo;t help it.</p>
<p>And the question I also asked is,</p>
<p>do you think you&rsquo;ll ever be able to forgive Russia?</p>
<p>And after much thought, almost,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s split, but most people will say, no.</p>
<p>I will never be able to forgive.</p>
<p>And because of the generalization</p>
<p>you talked about earlier,</p>
<p>that could even include all Russians.</p>
<p>In that statement, they mean all Russians.</p>
<p>Because if you do nothing,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s as bad or worse</p>
<p>than being part of the army that invades.</p>
<p>So the people that are just sitting there,</p>
<p>the good Germans,</p>
<p>the people that are just quietly going on with their lives,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just as bad, if not worse, is their perspective.</p>
<p>Earlier you said that going over to the Ukraine</p>
<p>has now allowed you to realize</p>
<p>just so many of the positives</p>
<p>of being here in the United States.</p>
<p>I have a good friend.</p>
<p>We both know him.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll name him by name,</p>
<p>but we&rsquo;ve communicated, the three of us,</p>
<p>from tier one special operations.</p>
<p>He spent years doing deployments,</p>
<p>really amazing individual.</p>
<p>And I remember when the pandemic hit,</p>
<p>he said on a text thread,</p>
<p>Americans aren&rsquo;t used to the government</p>
<p>interfering with their plans.</p>
<p>Around the world, many people are familiar with governments</p>
<p>dramatically interfering with their plans,</p>
<p>sometimes even in a seemingly random way.</p>
<p>Here, we were not braced for that.</p>
<p>We get speeding tickets and there&rsquo;s lines to vote</p>
<p>and things like that.</p>
<p>But I think the pandemic was one of the first times,</p>
<p>at least in my life,</p>
<p>that I can remember where it really seemed like</p>
<p>the government was impeding</p>
<p>what people naturally wanted to do.</p>
<p>And that was a shock for people here.</p>
<p>And I have what might seem like a somewhat mundane question,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s something that I saw on social media.</p>
<p>A lot of people were asking me to ask you.</p>
<p>And I was curious about too,</p>
<p>what was a typical day like over there?</p>
<p>Were you sleeping in a bed?</p>
<p>Were you sleeping on the ground?</p>
<p>Everyone seems to want to know, what were you eating?</p>
<p>Were you eating once a day?</p>
<p>Were you eating your steak?</p>
<p>Or were you in fairly deprived conditions over there?</p>
<p>I saw a couple photos that you posted</p>
<p>out of doors, in front of rubble,</p>
<p>with pith helmet on in one case.</p>
<p>What was a typical day like over there?</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s two modes.</p>
<p>One of them, I spent a lot of time in Kiev,</p>
<p>which is much safer than,</p>
<p>it may be obvious to state,</p>
<p>but for people who don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s in the middle of the country</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s much safer than the actual front,</p>
<p>that the where the battle is happening.</p>
<p>So the much, much safer than Kiev even is Lviv,</p>
<p>which is the Western part of the country.</p>
<p>So the times I spent in Kiev were fundamentally different</p>
<p>than the time I spent at the front.</p>
<p>And I went to the Kherson region,</p>
<p>which is where a lot of really heated battle was happening.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s several areas.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s Kharkiv, it&rsquo;s in the Northeast of the country.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s Donbass region,</p>
<p>which is the East of the country.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s Kherson region,</p>
<p>which by the way, I&rsquo;m not good at geography.</p>
<p>So is the Southeast of the country.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where, at least when I was there,</p>
<p>was a lot of really heated fighting happening.</p>
<p>So when I was in the Kherson region,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s what you would imagine,</p>
<p>the place that I stayed in a hotel</p>
<p>where all the lights have to stay off.</p>
<p>So the entire town, all the lights are off.</p>
<p>You have to kind of navigate through the darkness</p>
<p>and then use your phone to shine and so on.</p>
<p>This is terrible for the circadian system.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s exactly how can I do this?</p>
<p>Where&rsquo;s my element in the flood of greens?</p>
<p>How can I function?</p>
<p>No, there&rsquo;s, I think it was balanced</p>
<p>by the deep appreciation of being alive.</p>
<p>Right, no, I mean, this is the reason I asked.</p>
<p>This is the reason I ask is,</p>
<p>we get used to all these creature comforts</p>
<p>and we don&rsquo;t need them,</p>
<p>but we often come to depend on them</p>
<p>in a way that makes us feel like we need them.</p>
<p>Yeah, but very quickly,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s something about the intensity of life</p>
<p>that you see in people&rsquo;s eyes</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;ve been living through war</p>
<p>that makes you forget all those creature comforts.</p>
<p>And it was actually,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m somebody who hates traveling and so on.</p>
<p>I love the creature habits.</p>
<p>I love the comfort of the ritual, right?</p>
<p>But all of that was forgotten very quickly.</p>
<p>Just the intensity of feeling,</p>
<p>the intensity of love that people have for each other.</p>
<p>That was obvious.</p>
<p>In terms of food,</p>
<p>so there&rsquo;s a curfew.</p>
<p>So depends on what part of the country,</p>
<p>but usually you basically have to scammer home</p>
<p>at like 9 p.m.</p>
<p>So the hard curfew in a lot of places is 11 p.m. at night,</p>
<p>but by then you have to be home.</p>
<p>So in some places it&rsquo;s 10.</p>
<p>So at 9 p.m. you start going home,</p>
<p>which for me was kind of wonderful also</p>
<p>because I get to spend,</p>
<p>I get to be forced to spend time alone</p>
<p>and think for many hours in wherever I&rsquo;m staying,</p>
<p>which is really nice.</p>
<p>And everybody, there&rsquo;s a calmness</p>
<p>and the quietness to the whole thing.</p>
<p>In terms of food, once a day,</p>
<p>just the food is incredibly cheap and incredibly delicious.</p>
<p>People are still,</p>
<p>one of the things they can still take pride in</p>
<p>is making the best possible food they can.</p>
<p>So meat, but they do admire American meat.</p>
<p>So the meat is not as great as it could be in that country,</p>
<p>but I eat borscht every day,</p>
<p>all that kind of stuff, mostly meat.</p>
<p>So spend the entire day,</p>
<p>wake up in the morning with coffee,</p>
<p>spend the entire day talking to people,</p>
<p>which for me is very difficult</p>
<p>because of the intensity of the stories,</p>
<p>one after the other, after the other,</p>
<p>we just talk to regular people,</p>
<p>talk to soldiers, talk to politicians,</p>
<p>all kinds of soldiers.</p>
<p>I talk to people there who are doing rescue missions,</p>
<p>so Americans, I hung out with Tim Kennedy.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, the great Tim Kennedy.</p>
<p>The great Tim Kennedy,</p>
<p>who also him and many others revealed to me</p>
<p>one of the many reasons I&rsquo;m proud to be an American</p>
<p>is how trained and skilled</p>
<p>and effective American soldiers are.</p>
<p>And I guess for listeners of this podcast,</p>
<p>maybe we should familiarize them with who Tim Kennedy is</p>
<p>because I realized that a number of them will know.</p>
<p>How do you do that?</p>
<p>How do you try to summarize a man?</p>
<p>Right, and we can be accurate, but not exhaustive</p>
<p>as any good data are accurate, but not exhaustive.</p>
<p>Very skilled and accomplished MMA fighter,</p>
<p>very skilled and accomplished, former special operations.</p>
<p>Remember American patriot and a podcaster too, right?</p>
<p>Does he have his own podcast?</p>
<p>Maybe, maybe.</p>
<p>We know Andy Stumpf has his own podcast.</p>
<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s an amazing podcast, yeah, it&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>Yeah, clearing hot podcasts with Andy Stumpf.</p>
<p>But also Tim Kennedy&rsquo;s like the embodiment of America</p>
<p>and to the most beautiful and the most ridiculous degree.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s like, would you imagine,</p>
<p>what is it, Team America?</p>
<p>That like, I just imagine him like shirtless on a tank</p>
<p>rolling into enemy territory,</p>
<p>just screaming at the top of his lungs.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just his personality.</p>
<p>But not posturing, that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>He actually does the work as they say.</p>
<p>So this is the thing, he really embodies that.</p>
<p>Now, some of that is just his personality and humor.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to sort of comment on the humor of things,</p>
<p>not just with him.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very one other interesting thing I&rsquo;ve learned.</p>
<p>But also when he&rsquo;s actually helping people,</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s extremely good at what he does,</p>
<p>which is building teams that rescue,</p>
<p>that go into the most dangerous areas of Ukraine,</p>
<p>dangerous areas anywhere else and they get the job done.</p>
<p>And one of the things I heard time and time again,</p>
<p>which really interesting to me</p>
<p>that Ukrainian soldiers said that,</p>
<p>comparing Ukrainian, Russian and American soldiers,</p>
<p>American soldiers are the bravest,</p>
<p>which was very interesting for me to hear,</p>
<p>given how high the morale is for the Ukrainian soldiers.</p>
<p>But that just reveals that training</p>
<p>enables you to be brave.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not just about how well trained they are and so on,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s how intense and ferocious they are in the fighting.</p>
<p>And that makes you realize like this is American army,</p>
<p>not just through the technology,</p>
<p>especially the special force guys,</p>
<p>they still is one of the most effective</p>
<p>and terrifying armies in the world.</p>
<p>And listen, just for context,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m somebody who&rsquo;s for the most part anti-war, a pacifist,</p>
<p>but you get to see some of the realities of war</p>
<p>kind of wake you up to what needs to get done</p>
<p>to protect sovereignty,</p>
<p>to protect some of the values,</p>
<p>to protect civilians and homes and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Sometimes war has to happen.</p>
<p>And I should also mention the Russian side,</p>
<p>because while I haven&rsquo;t gotten to experience</p>
<p>the Russian side yet, I do fully plan to travel to Russia.</p>
<p>As I&rsquo;ve told everybody,</p>
<p>I was very upfront with everybody about this.</p>
<p>I would like to hear the story of Russians,</p>
<p>but I do know from the Ukrainian side,</p>
<p>like the grandmas, I love grandmas.</p>
<p>They told me stories that the Russians really,</p>
<p>the ones that entered their villages,</p>
<p>they really, really believe they&rsquo;re saving Ukraine</p>
<p>from Nazis, from Nazi occupation.</p>
<p>So they feel that there&rsquo;s the Ukraine</p>
<p>is under control of Nazi organizations</p>
<p>and they believe they&rsquo;re saving the country</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s their brothers and sisters.</p>
<p>So I think propaganda,</p>
<p>and I think truth is a very difficult thing to arrive.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s in that war zone.</p>
<p>I think in the 21st century,</p>
<p>one of the things you realize that so much of war,</p>
<p>even more so than in the past is an information war.</p>
<p>And people that just use Twitter</p>
<p>for their source of information might be surprised</p>
<p>to know how much misinformation there is on Twitter,</p>
<p>like real narratives being sold.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s really hard to know</p>
<p>who to believe.</p>
<p>And through all of that,</p>
<p>you have to try to keep an open mind</p>
<p>and ultimately ignore the powerful</p>
<p>and listen to actual citizens, actual people.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the other maybe obvious lesson is that</p>
<p>war is waged by powerful rich people</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s the poor people that suffer.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s just visible time and time again.</p>
<p>You mentioned the fact that people still enjoy food</p>
<p>or the pleasure of cooking,</p>
<p>or there&rsquo;s occasional humor or maybe frequent humor.</p>
<p>I know Jocko Willink has talked about this in warfare</p>
<p>and that all the elements of the human spirit</p>
<p>and condition still emerge at various times.</p>
<p>I find this amazing.</p>
<p>And you and I have had conversations about this before,</p>
<p>but the aperture of the mind,</p>
<p>the classic story that comes to mind</p>
<p>is the one of Viktor Frankl or Nelson Mandela.</p>
<p>You put somebody into a small box of confinement</p>
<p>and some people break under those conditions</p>
<p>and other people find entire stories</p>
<p>within a centimeter of concrete that can occupy them</p>
<p>and real stories and richness or humor or love</p>
<p>or fascination and surprise.</p>
<p>And I find this so interesting</p>
<p>that the mind is so adaptable.</p>
<p>We talked about creature comforts</p>
<p>and then lack of creature comforts</p>
<p>and the way that we can adapt.</p>
<p>And yet humans are always striving, it seems,</p>
<p>or one would hope for these better conditions</p>
<p>to better their conditions.</p>
<p>So as you&rsquo;ve come back and you&rsquo;ve been here now</p>
<p>back in the States for how long after your trip?</p>
<p>It depends on this podcast release,</p>
<p>but it felt like I&rsquo;ve never left.</p>
<p>So practically speaking, a couple of months.</p>
<p>Yeah, and we won&rsquo;t be shy.</p>
<p>We were recording this mid-September.</p>
<p>We actually recorded this several years ago.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re anticipating the future.</p>
<p>This is where we&rsquo;re going to start telling you</p>
<p>this is a simulation, you and Joe.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still trying to figure out what that actually means.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to take a quick break</p>
<p>and acknowledge one of our sponsors, Athletic Greens.</p>
<p>Athletic Greens, now called AG1,</p>
<p>is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink</p>
<p>that covers all of your foundational nutritional needs.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been taking Athletic Greens since 2012.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m delighted that they&rsquo;re sponsoring the podcast.</p>
<p>The reason I started taking Athletic Greens</p>
<p>and the reason I still take Athletic Greens</p>
<p>once or usually twice a day</p>
<p>is that it gets me the probiotics that I need for gut health.</p>
<p>Our gut is very important.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s populated by gut microbiota</p>
<p>that communicate with the brain, the immune system,</p>
<p>and basically all the biological systems of our body</p>
<p>to strongly impact our immediate and long-term health.</p>
<p>And those probiotics in Athletic Greens</p>
<p>are optimal and vital for microbiotic health.</p>
<p>In addition, Athletic Greens contains a number</p>
<p>of adaptogens, vitamins, and minerals</p>
<p>that make sure that all of my foundational</p>
<p>nutritional needs are met, and it tastes great.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Athletic Greens,</p>
<p>you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll give you five free travel packs</p>
<p>that make it really easy to mix up Athletic Greens</p>
<p>while you&rsquo;re on the road, in the car, on the plane, et cetera.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ll give you a year&rsquo;s supply of vitamin D3K2.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>to get the five free travel packs</p>
<p>and the year&rsquo;s supply of vitamin D3K2.</p>
<p>I know I speak for many people when I say</p>
<p>that we are very happy that you&rsquo;re back.</p>
<p>We know that it&rsquo;s not going to be the first and last trip,</p>
<p>that there will be others,</p>
<p>and that you&rsquo;ll be going to Russia as well,</p>
<p>and presumably other places as well,</p>
<p>in order to explore.</p>
<p>And I have to say as a podcaster and as your friend,</p>
<p>I was really inspired that your sense of adventure</p>
<p>and your sense of not just adventure,</p>
<p>but thoughtful, respectful adventure,</p>
<p>you understood what you were doing.</p>
<p>You weren&rsquo;t just going there to get some wartime footage</p>
<p>or something.</p>
<p>This wasn&rsquo;t a kick or a thrill.</p>
<p>This was really serious and remained serious.</p>
<p>So thank you for doing it.</p>
<p>And please, next time you go, bring Tim Kennedy again.</p>
<p>I feel like Tim Kennedy gets you into,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;ll take it,</p>
<p>because he really loves going to the most dangerous places</p>
<p>and helping people.</p>
<p>So I think he&rsquo;d get me into more trouble than it&rsquo;s worth.</p>
<p>And I should mention that,</p>
<p>I mean, there&rsquo;s many reasons I went,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s definitely not something</p>
<p>I take lightly or want to do again.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m doing things that I don&rsquo;t want to do.</p>
<p>I just feel like I have to.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re compelled.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s,</p>
<p>now I&rsquo;ll definitely talk about it as we all should.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s different areas of the world</p>
<p>that are seeing a lot of suffering.</p>
<p>Yemen, there&rsquo;s so many atrocities</p>
<p>going on in the world today,</p>
<p>but this one is just personal to me.</p>
<p>So I want to, I feel like I&rsquo;m qualified</p>
<p>just because of the language.</p>
<p>So most of the talking, by the way,</p>
<p>I was doing it, it was in Russian.</p>
<p>And so because of the language,</p>
<p>because of my history,</p>
<p>I felt like I have to do this particular thing.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s in many ways stupid and dangerous.</p>
<p>And that was made clear to me,</p>
<p>but I do many things of this nature</p>
<p>because the heart pulls towards that.</p>
<p>But also there&rsquo;s a freedom to not,</p>
<p>you know, I&rsquo;m afraid of death,</p>
<p>but I think there&rsquo;s a freedom to,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost like, okay, if I die,</p>
<p>I want to take full advantage</p>
<p>of not having a family currently.</p>
<p>I feel like when you have a family,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a responsibility for others.</p>
<p>So you immediately become more conservative and careful.</p>
<p>I feel like I want to take full advantage</p>
<p>of this particular moment in my life</p>
<p>when you can be a little bit more accepting of risk.</p>
<p>Well, you should definitely reproduce at some point.</p>
<p>Maybe before next time you should just freeze some sperm.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>Is that what you do with the ice bath?</p>
<p>Is that how that works?</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s always an opportunity to do some science protocols.</p>
<p>You know, there are products on the internet</p>
<p>and there are actually a few decent manuscripts</p>
<p>looking at how cold exposure</p>
<p>can increase testosterone levels,</p>
<p>but it doesn&rsquo;t happen by the cold directly.</p>
<p>A good scientist, as the authors of those papers were</p>
<p>and are, realized that it&rsquo;s the vasoconstriction</p>
<p>and then the vasodilation.</p>
<p>You know, as people warm up again,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s increased blood flow to the testicles.</p>
<p>And in women, it seems there&rsquo;s probably increased blood flow</p>
<p>to the reproductive organs as well</p>
<p>after people warm back up.</p>
<p>So that seems to cause some sort of hypernourishment</p>
<p>of the various cells,</p>
<p>the sertoli and leydig cells of the testes</p>
<p>that lead to increased output of testosterone</p>
<p>in men and women, testosterone as well.</p>
<p>So the cold exposure in any case is obviously a&hellip;</p>
<p>Do you do the ice bath?</p>
<p>Are you into that?</p>
<p>As a Russian, you probably consider that a hot tub.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s a nice thing to have fun</p>
<p>with every once in a while to warm up.</p>
<p>No, I haven&rsquo;t done it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been kind of waiting to maybe do it together</p>
<p>with you at some point.</p>
<p>Great, well, we have a guide.</p>
<p>No, we have one here.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll be straightforward for you.</p>
<p>I always say that the adrenaline comes in waves</p>
<p>and so if you just think about it,</p>
<p>walls, like you&rsquo;re going through a number of walls</p>
<p>of adrenaline as opposed to going for time,</p>
<p>becomes rather trivial.</p>
<p>With your jujitsu background and whatnot,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll immediately recognize the physiological sensation,</p>
<p>even though it&rsquo;s cold specifically,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s the adrenaline that makes you want to hop</p>
<p>out of the thing.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ve seen Joe&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>So Joe set up a really nice man cave</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s not even a cave because it&rsquo;s so big.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a network of man caves,</p>
<p>but it has a ice bath and a sauna next to each other.</p>
<p>So we have one of those here, ice bath and sauna.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ll have to get you in it when one of these days,</p>
<p>maybe tonight, maybe tomorrow.</p>
<p>No, although there is a,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know the underlying physiological basis,</p>
<p>but there does seem to be a trend</p>
<p>toward truth-telling in the sauna.</p>
<p>Some people refer to them as truth barrels.</p>
<p>Mine&rsquo;s a barrel sauna shaped like a barrel.</p>
<p>Who knows why?</p>
<p>Maybe under intense heat duress,</p>
<p>people just feel compelled to share.</p>
<p>I have a complicated relationship with saunas</p>
<p>because of all the weight cutting.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Some of the deepest sufferings, sorry to interrupt,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done was in the sauna.</p>
<p>I mean, I&rsquo;ve gone to some dark places in a sauna</p>
<p>because I wrestled my whole life, judo, jiu-jitsu.</p>
<p>And those weight cuts can really test the mind.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re truth-telling.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s a certain kind of truth-telling</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re sitting there</p>
<p>and the clock moves slower</p>
<p>than it has ever moved in your life.</p>
<p>Yeah, so I usually, for the most part,</p>
<p>I would try to have a bunch of sweats,</p>
<p>garbage bags and all that kind of stuff and run.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easier because you can distract the mind.</p>
<p>In the sauna, you can&rsquo;t distract the mind.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just you and all the excuses</p>
<p>and all the weaknesses in your mind</p>
<p>just coming to the surface.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re just sitting there and sweating or not sweating.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the worst.</p>
<p>And to talk about visual aperture, you&rsquo;re in a small box.</p>
<p>So it also inspires some claustrophobia,</p>
<p>even if you&rsquo;re not claustrophobic.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s absolutely true.</p>
<p>And the desire to just get out of the thing</p>
<p>is where you get a pretty serious adrenaline surge</p>
<p>from in the sauna as well.</p>
<p>Now the sauna actually will,</p>
<p>it won&rsquo;t deplete testosterone, but it kills sperm.</p>
<p>So for people that, sperm are on a 60-day sperm cycle.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re trying to donate sperm</p>
<p>or because that&rsquo;s what got us onto this</p>
<p>or fertilize an egg or eggs in whatever format,</p>
<p>dish or in vivo, as we say in science,</p>
<p>that which means, well, you can look it up, folks.</p>
<p>The 60-day sperm cycle.</p>
<p>So if you go into a really hot sauna</p>
<p>or a hot bath or a hot tub,</p>
<p>in 60 days, those sperm are going to be</p>
<p>a significantly greater portion of them will be dead,</p>
<p>will be non-viable.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a simple solution</p>
<p>to be able to just put an ice pack down there</p>
<p>or a jar, not this jar, but a jar of cold fluid</p>
<p>between their legs and just sit there</p>
<p>or they go back and forth between the ice bath and the sauna.</p>
<p>But you probably, if you&rsquo;re going to go back over there,</p>
<p>you should freeze sperm.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to do a couple episodes on fertility</p>
<p>when it&rsquo;s relatively inexpensive and you&rsquo;re young.</p>
<p>So you should probably do it now</p>
<p>because there is a association with autism</p>
<p>as males get older.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a strong one, it&rsquo;s significant,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s still a small contribution</p>
<p>to the autism phenotype.</p>
<p>As you age, don&rsquo;t sperm get wiser or no?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no science to back that.</p>
<p>No, but, you know, men can conceive healthy children</p>
<p>at a considerable age, but in any case,</p>
<p>but no, they don&rsquo;t get wiser.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like what happens is interesting.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s a little bit like the maturation of the brain</p>
<p>in the sense that some of the sperm get much better</p>
<p>at swimming and then many of them get less good.</p>
<p>Motility is a strong correlate of the DNA of the sperm.</p>
<p>This is probably a good time to announce</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m selling my sperm as an NFTs.</p>
<p>I want to see how much that-</p>
<p>Oh my goodness.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m riding the-</p>
<p>Well, your children, your future children</p>
<p>and my future children are supposed to do jiu-jitsu together</p>
<p>since I&rsquo;ve only done the one jiu-jitsu class.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m strongly vested in you having children,</p>
<p>but only in the friendly kind of way.</p>
<p>Well, yes, the friendly competition kind of way, yeah.</p>
<p>Dominance of the clan, yeah, for sure.</p>
<p>So moving on to science,</p>
<p>but still with our minds in the Ukraine,</p>
<p>did you encounter any scientists or see any universities</p>
<p>or as we know in this country and in Europe</p>
<p>and in elsewhere, science takes infrastructure.</p>
<p>You need buildings, you need laboratories,</p>
<p>you need robots, you need a lot of equipment</p>
<p>and you need minus 80 freezers and you need incubators</p>
<p>and you need money and you need technicians</p>
<p>and typically it&rsquo;s been the wealthier countries</p>
<p>that have been able to do more research</p>
<p>for sake of research and development and productization.</p>
<p>Certainly the Ukraine had some marvelous universities</p>
<p>and marvelous scientists.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s going on with science and scientists over there</p>
<p>and gosh, can we even calculate the loss of discovery</p>
<p>that is occurring as a consequence of this conflict?</p>
<p>So science goes on, before the war,</p>
<p>Ukraine had a very vibrant tech sector</p>
<p>that which means engineering and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>And Kiev has a lot of excellent universities</p>
<p>and they still go on.</p>
<p>The biggest hit, I would say,</p>
<p>is not the infrastructure of the science,</p>
<p>but the fact because of the high morale,</p>
<p>everybody is joining the military.</p>
<p>So everybody&rsquo;s going to the front to fight,</p>
<p>including you, Andrew Huberman would be fighting</p>
<p>and not because you have to, but because you want to.</p>
<p>And everybody you know would be really proud</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re fighting,</p>
<p>even though everyone tries to convince Andrew Huberman,</p>
<p>you have much better ways to contribute.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s deep honor in fighting for your country, yes,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s better ways to contribute to your country</p>
<p>than just picking up a gun that you&rsquo;re not that trained with</p>
<p>and going to the front, still they do it.</p>
<p>Scientists, engineers, CEOs, professors, students,</p>
<p>men and women, actors, men and women,</p>
<p>obviously primarily men, but men and women,</p>
<p>like much more than you would see in other militaries,</p>
<p>women are everybody, everybody wants to fight,</p>
<p>everybody&rsquo;s proud of fighting.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no discussion of kind of pacifism,</p>
<p>should we be fighting, is this right,</p>
<p>is this, you know, everybody&rsquo;s really proud of fighting.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s this kind of black hole that pulls everything,</p>
<p>all the resource into the war effort,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not just financial, but also psychological.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like, if you&rsquo;re a scientist,</p>
<p>it feels like almost like you&rsquo;re dishonoring humanity</p>
<p>by continuing to do things you were doing before.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of people that converted to being soldiers,</p>
<p>they literally watch a YouTube video</p>
<p>of how to shoot a particular gun,</p>
<p>how to arm a drone with a grenade, you know,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re a tech person, you know how to work with drones,</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;re gonna use that, use whatever skills you got,</p>
<p>figure out whatever skills you got and how to use them</p>
<p>to help the effort on the front, and so that&rsquo;s a big hit.</p>
<p>But that said that, you know,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked to a lot of folks in Kiev,</p>
<p>faculty primarily in the tech economics space,</p>
<p>so I didn&rsquo;t get a chance to interact with folks</p>
<p>who are on the biology, chemistry,</p>
<p>neuroscience side of things, but that still goes on.</p>
<p>So one of the really impressive things about Ukraine</p>
<p>is that they&rsquo;re able to maintain infrastructure,</p>
<p>like road, food supply, all that kind of stuff,</p>
<p>education while the war&rsquo;s going on, especially in Kiev.</p>
<p>The war started where nobody knew</p>
<p>whether Kiev was gonna be taken by the Russian forces,</p>
<p>it was surrounded.</p>
<p>And a lot of experts from outside</p>
<p>were convinced that Russia would take Kiev and they didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And one of the really impressive things as a leader,</p>
<p>one of the things I really experienced</p>
<p>is that a lot of people criticized Zelensky before the war.</p>
<p>He only had about like 30% approval rate,</p>
<p>a lot of people didn&rsquo;t like Zelensky.</p>
<p>But one of the great things he did as a leader,</p>
<p>which I&rsquo;m not sure many leaders would be able to do,</p>
<p>is when Kiev was clearly being invaded,</p>
<p>he chose to stay, he stayed in the capital, everybody,</p>
<p>all the American military, the intelligence agencies,</p>
<p>NATO, his own staff, advisors all told him to flee</p>
<p>and he stayed.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s, I think that was a beacon,</p>
<p>a symbol for the rest, for the universities, for science,</p>
<p>for the infrastructure that we&rsquo;re staying to.</p>
<p>And that kept the whole thing going.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an interesting social experiment that happened.</p>
<p>I think for folks who are interested</p>
<p>in sort of gun control in this country in particular,</p>
<p>is one of the decisions they made early on</p>
<p>is to give guns to everybody, semi-automatics.</p>
<p>Early on in the war?</p>
<p>Early on in the war, yeah.</p>
<p>So everybody got a gun.</p>
<p>They also released a bunch of prisoners from prison</p>
<p>because there was no staff to keep the prisons running.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s a very interesting psychological experiment</p>
<p>of like, how is this gonna go?</p>
<p>Everybody has a gun.</p>
<p>Are they gonna start robbing places?</p>
<p>Are they going to start taking advantage</p>
<p>of a chaotic situation?</p>
<p>And what happened is that crime went to zero.</p>
<p>So it turned out that this,</p>
<p>as an experiment, worked wonderfully.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a case where love generalized.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Or at least hate did not.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s love or it&rsquo;s sort of lack</p>
<p>of initiative for self, you know,</p>
<p>common culture directed hate.</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t, right.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s very correct to say</p>
<p>that it wasn&rsquo;t hate that was unifying people.</p>
<p>It was love of country, love of community.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably the same thing that will happen to humans</p>
<p>when like aliens invade.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the common effort.</p>
<p>Everybody puts everything else to the side.</p>
<p>Plus just the sheer amount of guns.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s similar to like Texas.</p>
<p>You realize like, well,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s going to be a self-correcting mechanism very quickly</p>
<p>because the rule of law was also put aside, right?</p>
<p>Like basically the police force lost a lot of power</p>
<p>because everybody else has guns</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re kind of taking the law into their own hands.</p>
<p>And that system, at least in this particular case,</p>
<p>in this particular moment in human history, worked.</p>
<p>So interesting lesson, you know.</p>
<p>It is.</p>
<p>I had an interesting contrast that I&rsquo;ll share with you.</p>
<p>Because you mentioned Texas.</p>
<p>So not so long ago, I was in Austin.</p>
<p>I often visit you or others in Austin, as you know.</p>
<p>And many doors that I walked past, including a school,</p>
<p>said no firearms past this point.</p>
<p>You know, there&rsquo;s a sticker on the door.</p>
<p>You see this on hospitals sometimes.</p>
<p>I saw this at Baylor College of Medicine, et cetera.</p>
<p>Relatively common to see in Texas.</p>
<p>Not so common in California.</p>
<p>And then I flew to the San Francisco Bay Area,</p>
<p>was walking by an elementary school in my old neighborhood</p>
<p>and saw a similar sticker and looked at it.</p>
<p>And it said no peanuts or other allergy-containing foods</p>
<p>past this point on the door of this elementary school.</p>
<p>So quite a different contrast, you know, guns and peanuts.</p>
<p>Now, peanut allergies, obviously,</p>
<p>are very serious for some people,</p>
<p>although there&rsquo;s great research out of Stanford</p>
<p>showing that early exposure to peanuts</p>
<p>can prevent the allergies.</p>
<p>But don&rsquo;t start rubbing yourself in peanut butter, folks,</p>
<p>if you have a peanut allergy.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not the best way to deal with it.</p>
<p>In any case, the contrast of what&rsquo;s dangerous,</p>
<p>the contrast of, you know,</p>
<p>familiarity with guns versus no familiarity,</p>
<p>you know, in Israel and elsewhere,</p>
<p>you see machine guns in the airport.</p>
<p>In Germany, Frankfurt, you see machine guns in the airport.</p>
<p>Not so common in the United States.</p>
<p>So again, I feel like there&rsquo;s this aperture of vision.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s this aperture of pleasures</p>
<p>versus creature comforts and lack of creature comforts.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s this aperture of danger, right?</p>
<p>People who are familiar with guns, you know,</p>
<p>are familiar with people coming in</p>
<p>and setting their firearm on the table and eating dinner,</p>
<p>you know, but if you&rsquo;re not accustomed to that,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s jarring, right?</p>
<p>I should mention, people know this throughout human history,</p>
<p>but the human ability to get assimilated,</p>
<p>no, get used to violence is incredible.</p>
<p>So like, you could be living in a peaceful time,</p>
<p>like we&rsquo;re here now, and there&rsquo;ll be one explosion,</p>
<p>like a 9-11 type of situation.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;d be a huge shock, terrifying, everybody freaks out.</p>
<p>The second one is a huge drop-off</p>
<p>in how freaked out you get.</p>
<p>And in a matter of days, sometimes hours,</p>
<p>it becomes the normal.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked to so many people in Kharkiv,</p>
<p>which is one of the towns</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s seen a lot of heated battle.</p>
<p>You ask them, is it safe there?</p>
<p>In fact, when I went to the,</p>
<p>closer and closer to the war zone,</p>
<p>you ask people, is it safe?</p>
<p>And their answer&rsquo;s usually, yeah, it&rsquo;s pretty safe.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all signal to noise.</p>
<p>Nobody has told me, except Western reporters</p>
<p>sitting in the west side of Ukraine,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s really dangerous here.</p>
<p>Everyone&rsquo;s like, yeah, it&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>My uncle just died yesterday, he was shot.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s pretty good, the farm&rsquo;s still running.</p>
<p>They, how do I put it?</p>
<p>They focus on the positive, that&rsquo;s one,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a deeper truth there,</p>
<p>which is you just get used to difficult situations</p>
<p>and the stuff that make you happy</p>
<p>and the stuff that make you upset</p>
<p>is relative to that new normal that you establish.</p>
<p>Well, I grew up in California</p>
<p>and there were a lot of earthquakes.</p>
<p>I remember the 89 quake,</p>
<p>I remember the Embarcadero freeway pancaking</p>
<p>on top of people and cars.</p>
<p>I remember I moved to Southern California,</p>
<p>there was a Northridge quake.</p>
<p>Wherever I moved, there seemed to be earthquakes.</p>
<p>I never worry about earthquakes, ever.</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>In fact, I don&rsquo;t like the destruction they cause,</p>
<p>but every once in a while, an earthquake will roll through</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s kind of exciting.</p>
<p>It sounds like a train coming through.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, wow, like the earth is moving.</p>
<p>Again, I don&rsquo;t want anyone to get harmed,</p>
<p>but I enjoy a good rumble coming through nonetheless.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s signal to noise.</p>
<p>But if I saw a tornado, I&rsquo;d freak out.</p>
<p>And people from the Midwest are probably comfortable</p>
<p>with Dan Gable, the great wrestler from the Midwest,</p>
<p>so that you know, and I&rsquo;ve never met,</p>
<p>but I have great respect for.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s probably, you know, see the tornadoes,</p>
<p>like, ah, yeah, maybe, you know.</p>
<p>So I think signal to noise is real.</p>
<p>Before I neglect, although I won&rsquo;t forget,</p>
<p>speaking of signal to noise and environment,</p>
<p>you are returning to, or have gone back to,</p>
<p>one of your original natural habitats,</p>
<p>which is the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,</p>
<p>which is-</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually difficult to pronounce in full, MIT, right?</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve been spending some time there teaching</p>
<p>and doing other things.</p>
<p>Tell us what you&rsquo;re up to with MIT recently.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s, I&rsquo;m really glad that you,</p>
<p>being on the West Coast,</p>
<p>know the difference between like Boston, New York.</p>
<p>I feel like a lot of people think it&rsquo;s like the East Coast.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all-</p>
<p>Very different, especially to Bostonians and New Yorkers.</p>
<p>They get very aggressive.</p>
<p>Yeah, I love it.</p>
<p>I gave lectures there in front of an in-person crowd.</p>
<p>What were you talking about?</p>
<p>For the AI.</p>
<p>So different aspects of AI.</p>
<p>And, you know, robotics, machine learning.</p>
<p>So for people who know the artificial intelligence field,</p>
<p>they usually don&rsquo;t use the term AI,</p>
<p>and people from outside use AIs.</p>
<p>The biggest breakthroughs in the machine learning field</p>
<p>was some discussion of robotics and so on.</p>
<p>Yeah, it was in-person, it was wonderful.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a sucker for that.</p>
<p>I really avoided teaching</p>
<p>or any kind of interaction during COVID</p>
<p>because people put a lot of emphasis on,</p>
<p>but also got comfortable with remote teaching.</p>
<p>And I think nobody enjoyed it,</p>
<p>except sort of there&rsquo;s a notion</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s much easier to do</p>
<p>because you don&rsquo;t have to travel,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have to,</p>
<p>you can do it in your pajamas kind of thing.</p>
<p>But when you actually get to do it,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t get the same kind of joy</p>
<p>that you do when you&rsquo;re teaching.</p>
<p>As a student, you don&rsquo;t get</p>
<p>the same kind of joy of learning.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not as effective and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>So to be in-person together with people,</p>
<p>to see their eyes, to get their excitement,</p>
<p>to get the questions and all the interactions,</p>
<p>yeah, it was awesome.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m still a sucker and a believer</p>
<p>in the ideal of MIT, of the university.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s an incredible place.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something in the air still,</p>
<p>but it really hit, the pandemic hit universities hard</p>
<p>and I can say this, this is not you saying it,</p>
<p>this is me saying it,</p>
<p>that administrations, as in all cases,</p>
<p>when people criticize institutions,</p>
<p>the pandemic has given more power to the administration</p>
<p>and taken away power from the faculty and the students.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s from everybody involved,</p>
<p>including the administration, that&rsquo;s a concern</p>
<p>because the university is about the teachers</p>
<p>and the students, that should be primary.</p>
<p>And whenever you have a pandemic,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an opportunity to increase the amount of rules.</p>
<p>Like one of the things that really bothered me</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll scream from the top of the MIT Dome about this</p>
<p>is they&rsquo;ve instituted a new Tim ticket system,</p>
<p>which is if you&rsquo;re a visitor to the campus at MIT,</p>
<p>you have to register.</p>
<p>You have to, first of all, show that you&rsquo;re vaccinated,</p>
<p>but more importantly, there&rsquo;s a process to visiting.</p>
<p>You need to get permission to visit.</p>
<p>One of the reasons I loved MIT,</p>
<p>unlike some other institutions,</p>
<p>MIT just leaves the door open to anyone.</p>
<p>In classrooms, you can roll in the ridiculous characters,</p>
<p>the students that are kind of like</p>
<p>usually doing business stuff or economics</p>
<p>can roll into a physics class and just,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re kind of not allowed, but it&rsquo;s a gray area.</p>
<p>So you let that happen.</p>
<p>And that creates a flourishing of a community</p>
<p>that was beautiful.</p>
<p>And I think adding extra rules puts a squeeze on</p>
<p>and limits some of the flourishing.</p>
<p>And I hope some of that dissipates over time</p>
<p>as we kind of let go of the risk aversion</p>
<p>that was created by the pandemic</p>
<p>as we kind of enter the new, the normal return back,</p>
<p>some of that flourishing can happen.</p>
<p>But when you&rsquo;re actually in there with the students,</p>
<p>yeah, it was magic.</p>
<p>I love it. I love it.</p>
<p>Well, some of your earliest videos on your YouTube channel</p>
<p>were of you in the classroom, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how this all started.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s how YouTube,</p>
<p>like putting stuff on YouTube was terrifying, right?</p>
<p>Well, especially at the time when you did it again,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re a pioneer in that sense.</p>
<p>You did that, Jordan Peterson did that.</p>
<p>Putting up lectures is, yeah, I would,</p>
<p>I teach still every winter I teach, direct a course,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll be doing even more teaching going forward.</p>
<p>But the idea of those videos being on the web is,</p>
<p>yeah, that spikes my cortisol a little bit.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s terrifying because you get to,</p>
<p>and everybody has a different experience.</p>
<p>Like for me being a junior research scientist,</p>
<p>the kind of natural concern is like, who am I?</p>
<p>And when I was given this lecture,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, I don&rsquo;t deserve any of this.</p>
<p>Like why?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s your humility coming through.</p>
<p>And I actually think that humility</p>
<p>on the part of an instructor is good</p>
<p>because those that think that they are entitled</p>
<p>and who else could give this lecture, then I worry more.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s, I once heard,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s still true that at Caltech, right?</p>
<p>The great California Institute of Technology,</p>
<p>not far from here, that many of the faculty</p>
<p>are actually afraid of the students,</p>
<p>not physically afraid, but they&rsquo;re intellectually afraid</p>
<p>because the students are so smart.</p>
<p>And teaching there can be downright frightening, I&rsquo;ve heard.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s great, keeps everybody on their toes.</p>
<p>And I think, and you know, I&rsquo;ve been corrected</p>
<p>in lecture before at Stanford and elsewhere.</p>
<p>You know, when my lab was at UC San Diego,</p>
<p>where someone will say, hey, wait, you know,</p>
<p>last lecture, you said this, and now you said that,</p>
<p>and it were on the podcast, you know?</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s that moment where, you know,</p>
<p>you sometimes feel that urge to defend you,</p>
<p>oh, you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>And I think it depends on how one was trained.</p>
<p>My graduate advisor was wonderful at saying,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, all the time.</p>
<p>And she went to Harvard, Radcliffe, UCSF, and Caltech</p>
<p>and was a brilliant, brilliant woman</p>
<p>and had no problem saying, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have that problem.</p>
<p>So I usually have two guys that somebody speaks up,</p>
<p>grab them, drag them out of the room,</p>
<p>never see him again.</p>
<p>So everybody is really supportive.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t understand the amount of love and support I get.</p>
<p>Especially when the last few students are there</p>
<p>and everybody seems to be nodding as we&rsquo;re going.</p>
<p>No, I think that I&rsquo;d love to sit in on one of your lectures.</p>
<p>I know very little about AI machine learning or robotics.</p>
<p>But gosh.</p>
<p>Have you ever talked at MIT?</p>
<p>Have you ever given lectures?</p>
<p>Oh yeah.</p>
<p>When I went on the job market as a faculty member,</p>
<p>my final two choices were between MIT Peek Hour.</p>
<p>I had an on-paper offer.</p>
<p>Wonderful place, wonderful place to do neuroscience.</p>
<p>And UC San Diego,</p>
<p>which is a wonderful neuroscience program.</p>
<p>In the end, it made sense for me</p>
<p>to be on the West Coast for personal reasons,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s some amazing neuroscience going on there.</p>
<p>Goodness.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s always been true and is going to continue.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a long time since I&rsquo;ve been invited back there.</p>
<p>Oddly enough, when I started doing more podcasting</p>
<p>and I still run a lab,</p>
<p>but I shrunk my lab considerably when I was doing,</p>
<p>as I&rsquo;ve done more podcasting.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve received fewer academic lecture invites,</p>
<p>which makes sense.</p>
<p>But now they&rsquo;re sort of coming back.</p>
<p>And so when people invite now, I always say,</p>
<p>do you want me to talk about the ventral thalamus</p>
<p>and its role in anxiety and aggression?</p>
<p>Or do you want me to talk about the podcast?</p>
<p>And my big fear is I&rsquo;m going to go back to give a lecture</p>
<p>about the retina or something,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll start off with an athletic greens read</p>
<p>or something like that, just reflexively.</p>
<p>Just kidding, that wouldn&rsquo;t happen.</p>
<p>But listen, I think it&rsquo;s great to continue</p>
<p>to keep a foot in both places.</p>
<p>I was so happy to hear that you&rsquo;re teaching at MIT</p>
<p>because podcasting is one thing, teaching is another,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s overlap there in the Venn diagram.</p>
<p>But listen, the students,</p>
<p>they get to sit in on one of your lectures</p>
<p>and you may see me sitting there in the audience soon</p>
<p>when I creep into your class.</p>
<p>Sunglasses.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right, wearing a red shirt.</p>
<p>You won&rsquo;t recognize me.</p>
<p>Will are certainly receiving a great gift.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve watched your lectures on YouTube,</p>
<p>even the early ones.</p>
<p>And listen, I know you to be a phenomenal teacher.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s something about,</p>
<p>so I&rsquo;m also doing, like I said,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pretty late last night working</p>
<p>for a deadline on a paper.</p>
<p>One of the things that I hope to do</p>
<p>for hopefully the rest of my life</p>
<p>is to continue publishing.</p>
<p>And I think it&rsquo;s really important to do that,</p>
<p>even if you continue the podcast</p>
<p>because you want to be just on your own intellectual</p>
<p>and scientific journey as you do podcasting.</p>
<p>As at least for me,</p>
<p>and especially on the engineering side,</p>
<p>because I want to build stuff.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s like keeps your ego in check,</p>
<p>keeps you humble.</p>
<p>Because I think if you talk too much on the microphone,</p>
<p>you start getting,</p>
<p>you might lose track of the grounding</p>
<p>that comes from engineering and from science</p>
<p>and the scientific process</p>
<p>and the criticisms that you get,</p>
<p>all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>And how slow and iterative it is.</p>
<p>We have two papers right now</p>
<p>that are in the revision stage.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a very long road.</p>
<p>And I was asked this recently</p>
<p>because I met with my chairman.</p>
<p>He said, do you want to continue to run a lab</p>
<p>or are you just going to go full-time on the podcast?</p>
<p>And Stanford has been very supportive, I must say,</p>
<p>as I know MIT has been a view of you.</p>
<p>And I said, oh,</p>
<p>I absolutely want to continue to be involved in research</p>
<p>and do research.</p>
<p>And we started talking about these papers</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re looking over my,</p>
<p>this was my yearly review and looking back,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, goodness,</p>
<p>these papers have been in play for a very long time.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a long road,</p>
<p>but you learn more and more.</p>
<p>And the more time you spend myopically</p>
<p>looking at a bunch of data,</p>
<p>the more you learn and the more you think.</p>
<p>I totally agree.</p>
<p>Talking into these devices for podcasts is wonderful</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s fun.</p>
<p>It relieves a certain itch that we both have.</p>
<p>And hopefully it lands some important information</p>
<p>out there for people.</p>
<p>But doing research is like the,</p>
<p>I guess if you know, you know,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s like the unpeeling of the onion,</p>
<p>knowing that there could be something there.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just nothing like it.</p>
<p>I mean, you do, especially with the pandemic.</p>
<p>And for me, both Twitter and the podcast</p>
<p>have made me much more impatient</p>
<p>about the slowness of the review process.</p>
<p>Because-</p>
<p>Twitter will do that.</p>
<p>Twitter will do that.</p>
<p>Even with podcasts, you have a cool,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll find something cool and then you have ideas</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll just say them</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;ll be out pretty quickly.</p>
<p>And we do a post right now about something</p>
<p>that we both found interesting and it&rsquo;s out in the world.</p>
<p>And you can write up something like,</p>
<p>there is a culture in computer science</p>
<p>of posting stuff on archive and pre-prints</p>
<p>that don&rsquo;t get in your review.</p>
<p>And sometimes they don&rsquo;t even go through</p>
<p>the review process ever.</p>
<p>Because like people just start using them if it&rsquo;s code.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like, what&rsquo;s the point of this?</p>
<p>It works, it&rsquo;s self evident that it works</p>
<p>because people are using it.</p>
<p>And that, I think, applies more to engineering fields</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s an actual tool that works.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter if it,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t have to scientifically prove that it works.</p>
<p>It works because it&rsquo;s using for a lot of people.</p>
<p>Well, sorry to interrupt, but I just said,</p>
<p>for point of reference,</p>
<p>the famous paper describing the double helix,</p>
<p>which earned Watson and Crick the Nobel Prize</p>
<p>and should have earned</p>
<p>Rosalind Franklin Nobel Prize too, of course,</p>
<p>but they got it for the structure of DNA, of course.</p>
<p>That paper was never reviewed at Nature.</p>
<p>They published it because its importance</p>
<p>was self-evident or whatever they decided.</p>
<p>So like the editors-</p>
<p>It was that purely editorial decision, I believe.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s what I was told by someone</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s currently an editor at Nature.</p>
<p>If that turns out to not be correct,</p>
<p>someone will tell us in the comments for sure.</p>
<p>Well, I think-</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s pretty interesting, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really interesting.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most significant discovery in biology</p>
<p>and bioengineering, leading to bioengineering as well,</p>
<p>of course, of the last century was not peer-reviewed.</p>
<p>Yeah, but so Eric Weinstein,</p>
<p>but many others have talked about this,</p>
<p>which is, I mean, I don&rsquo;t think people understand</p>
<p>how poor the peer review process is.</p>
<p>Just the amount of,</p>
<p>because you think peer review,</p>
<p>it means all the best peers get together</p>
<p>and they review your stuff.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s unpaid work</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s usually a small number of people.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a very, they have a very select perspective.</p>
<p>So they might not be the best person,</p>
<p>especially if it&rsquo;s super novel work.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s who has time to do it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m on a bunch of editorial boards still.</p>
<p>Why, I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>but I enjoy the peer review process and sending papers out.</p>
<p>Oftentimes the best scientists are very busy</p>
<p>and don&rsquo;t have time to review.</p>
<p>And oftentimes the more premier journals</p>
<p>will select from a kind of a unique kit</p>
<p>of very good scientists</p>
<p>who are very close to the work.</p>
<p>Sometimes the people are very far from the work.</p>
<p>It really depends.</p>
<p>And both have negatives, right?</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re very close to the work,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s jealousy and all those basic human things</p>
<p>very far from the work.</p>
<p>You might not appreciate the nuance, contribution,</p>
<p>all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>And their psychology, sorry to interrupt again,</p>
<p>but a good friend of mine</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s extremely successful neuroscientist,</p>
<p>Howard Hughes investigator, et cetera,</p>
<p>always told me that they,</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t even say whether or not who they are,</p>
<p>they select their reviewers on the basis</p>
<p>of who has been publishing very well recently,</p>
<p>because they assume that that person</p>
<p>is going to be more benevolent</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;ve been doing well so that the love expands.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good point to that actually.</p>
<p>But the idea is that editors</p>
<p>might actually be the best reviewers.</p>
<p>So that was the traditional,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the thing I wanted to mention</p>
<p>that Eric Weinstein talks about.</p>
<p>That back several decades ago,</p>
<p>editors had much more power.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s something to be made for that</p>
<p>because they, editors are the ones</p>
<p>who are responsible for crafting the journal.</p>
<p>Like they really are invested in this.</p>
<p>And so, and they&rsquo;re also often experts, right?</p>
<p>So it makes sense for an editor</p>
<p>to have a bit of power in this case.</p>
<p>Like usually if an idea is truly novel, you could see it.</p>
<p>And so it makes sense for an editor</p>
<p>to have more power in that regard.</p>
<p>Of course, for me, I think peer review</p>
<p>should be done the way tweets are done,</p>
<p>which is like crowdsourced or Amazon reviews.</p>
<p>Let the crowd decide.</p>
<p>Let the crowd decide.</p>
<p>And let the crowd add depth and breadth</p>
<p>in context for the contribution.</p>
<p>So, if the paper overstates the degree of contribution,</p>
<p>the crowd will check you on that.</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s not enough support or like the conclusions</p>
<p>are not supported by the evidence,</p>
<p>the crowd will check you on that.</p>
<p>There could be, of course, a political bickering</p>
<p>that enters the picture,</p>
<p>especially on very controversial topics.</p>
<p>But I think I trust the intelligence of human beings</p>
<p>to figure that out.</p>
<p>And I think most of us are trying</p>
<p>to figure this whole process out.</p>
<p>I just wish it was happening much faster</p>
<p>because on the important topics,</p>
<p>the review cycle could be faster.</p>
<p>And we learned that through COVID</p>
<p>that Twitter was actually pretty effective</p>
<p>at doing science communication.</p>
<p>It was really interesting.</p>
<p>Some of the best scientists took to Twitter</p>
<p>to communicate their own work and other people&rsquo;s work</p>
<p>and always putting into sort of the caveats</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s not peer reviewed and so on,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s all out there.</p>
<p>And the data just moves so fast.</p>
<p>And if you want stuff to move fast,</p>
<p>Twitter is the best medium of communication for that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s cool to see.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m now on Twitter more regularly.</p>
<p>And initially it was just Instagram.</p>
<p>And I remember you and I used to have these</p>
<p>over dinner or drink conversations where I&rsquo;d say,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t understand Twitter.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;d say, I don&rsquo;t understand Instagram.</p>
<p>And of course we understand how it worked</p>
<p>and how to work each respective platform.</p>
<p>But I think we were both trying to figure out,</p>
<p>what is driving the psychology of these different venues?</p>
<p>Because they are quite distinct psychologies</p>
<p>for whatever reason.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;m finally starting to understand Twitter</p>
<p>and enjoy it a little bit.</p>
<p>Initially, I wasn&rsquo;t prepared for the level</p>
<p>of kind of reflexive scrutiny.</p>
<p>It sounds a little bit oxymoronic,</p>
<p>but that people kind of like pick up on one small thing</p>
<p>and then drive it down that trajectory.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t seem to be happening quite as much on Instagram,</p>
<p>but I love your tweets.</p>
<p>I do have a question about your Twitter account</p>
<p>and how you, do you have sort of internal filters</p>
<p>of what you&rsquo;ll put up and won&rsquo;t put up?</p>
<p>Because sometimes you&rsquo;ll put up things</p>
<p>that are about life and reflections.</p>
<p>Other times you&rsquo;ll put up things</p>
<p>like what you&rsquo;re excited about in AI,</p>
<p>or of course, point to various podcasts,</p>
<p>including your own, but others as well.</p>
<p>How do you approach social media?</p>
<p>Not how do you regulate your behavior on there</p>
<p>in terms of how much time, et cetera.</p>
<p>I know you&rsquo;ve talked about that before,</p>
<p>but what&rsquo;s your mindset around social media</p>
<p>when you go on there to either post or forage</p>
<p>or respond to information?</p>
<p>I think I try to add some, not to sound cliche,</p>
<p>but some love out there into the world,</p>
<p>into as OJ Simpson calls it, Twitter world.</p>
<p>I think there is this viral negativity that can take hold.</p>
<p>And I try to find the right language</p>
<p>to add good vibes out there.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s actually really, really tricky</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s something about positivity</p>
<p>that sounds fake.</p>
<p>And I can&rsquo;t quite put my finger on it,</p>
<p>but whenever I talk about love and the positive</p>
<p>and almost childlike in my curiosity and positivity,</p>
<p>people start to think like,</p>
<p>surely he has like skeletons in the closet.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s dead bodies in his basement.</p>
<p>Like this must be a fake.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the attic.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the attic?</p>
<p>The attic.</p>
<p>I keep mine in the basement.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the details.</p>
<p>I was referring to your attic.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have an attic or a basement.</p>
<p>Nor dead bodies.</p>
<p>I just want to be very clear.</p>
<p>Yeah, I do have an attic</p>
<p>and actually haven&rsquo;t been up there.</p>
<p>Maybe there is bodies up there, but yes,</p>
<p>I prefer the basement.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s colder down there.</p>
<p>I like it.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s an assumption that this is not genuine</p>
<p>or it&rsquo;s disingenuous in some kind of way.</p>
<p>And so I try to find the right language</p>
<p>for that kind of stuff, how to be positive.</p>
<p>Some of it, I was really inspired</p>
<p>by Elon&rsquo;s approach to Twitter.</p>
<p>Not all of it, but the, when he just is silly.</p>
<p>I found that silliness, I think it&rsquo;s Herman Hesse said,</p>
<p>something to paraphrase one of my favorite writers,</p>
<p>I think in Steppenwolf, said,</p>
<p>learn what is to be taken seriously and laugh at the rest.</p>
<p>I think I try to be silly, laugh at myself,</p>
<p>laugh at the absurdity of life.</p>
<p>And then in part, when I&rsquo;m serious,</p>
<p>try to just be positive, just see a positive perspective.</p>
<p>But, and also, as you said,</p>
<p>people pick out certain words and so on</p>
<p>and they attack each other,</p>
<p>attack me over certain usage of words</p>
<p>in a particular tweet.</p>
<p>I think the thing I try to do</p>
<p>is think positively towards them.</p>
<p>Do not escalate.</p>
<p>So whenever somebody&rsquo;s criticizing me and so on,</p>
<p>I just smile.</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s a lesson to be learned, I learn it.</p>
<p>And then I just send good vibes their way, don&rsquo;t respond.</p>
<p>And just hopefully sort of through karma</p>
<p>and through kind of the ripple effect of positivity,</p>
<p>have an impact on them and the rest of Twitter.</p>
<p>And what you find is that builds your actions,</p>
<p>create the community.</p>
<p>So how I behave gets me surrounded by certain people.</p>
<p>But lately, especially Ukraine is one topic like this.</p>
<p>I also thought about talking to somebody</p>
<p>who reached out to me is Andrew Tate,</p>
<p>who&rsquo;s extremely controversial.</p>
<p>From the perspective of a lot of people, he&rsquo;s a misogynist.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve heard his name</p>
<p>and I know that there&rsquo;s a lot of controversy around him.</p>
<p>Maybe you could familiarize me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been pretty nosed down in podcast prep</p>
<p>and I tried to do this vacation thing</p>
<p>for about three, four weeks.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard about that.</p>
<p>Yeah, and it sort of worked.</p>
<p>I did get some time in the Colorado wilderness by myself,</p>
<p>which was great.</p>
<p>I did get some downtime, but in any event,</p>
<p>I mainly consisted of reading and wasn&rsquo;t-</p>
<p>In nature.</p>
<p>Reading in nature, sauna, ice bath, working out,</p>
<p>good food, a little extra sleep, these kinds of things.</p>
<p>I never really felt I needed it,</p>
<p>but I am pretty naive when it comes</p>
<p>to the kind of current controversies,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve heard his name</p>
<p>and I think he&rsquo;s been de-platformed</p>
<p>on a couple of platforms.</p>
<p>Do I have that right?</p>
<p>Yeah, so I should also admit</p>
<p>that while I might know more than you, it&rsquo;s not by much.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s like a five-year-old talking</p>
<p>to a four-year-old right now.</p>
<p>Is he an athlete, a podcaster?</p>
<p>So basic summary, he used to be a fighter,</p>
<p>kickboxer, I believe, was pretty successful.</p>
<p>And then during that and after that,</p>
<p>I think he was in a reality show</p>
<p>and he had all these programs</p>
<p>that are basically like pickup artist advice.</p>
<p>He has this community of people where he gives advice</p>
<p>on how to pick up women,</p>
<p>how to be successful in relationships,</p>
<p>how to make a lot of money.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s like, it costs money to enter those programs.</p>
<p>So a lot of the criticism that he gets</p>
<p>is kind of, it&rsquo;s like a pyramid scheme</p>
<p>where you convince people to join</p>
<p>so that they can make more money</p>
<p>and then they convince others to join, that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not why I&rsquo;m interested in talking to him.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m interested because one of the guests,</p>
<p>maybe I shouldn&rsquo;t mention who,</p>
<p>but one of the female guests I had,</p>
<p>really a big scientist, said that her two kids</p>
<p>that are 13 and 12 really look up to Andrew.</p>
<p>Is there male children?</p>
<p>Male, yeah, male.</p>
<p>And I hear this time and time again.</p>
<p>So like he is somebody that a lot of teens,</p>
<p>young teens look up to.</p>
<p>So I haven&rsquo;t done serious research.</p>
<p>Like I usually try to avoid doing research</p>
<p>until I like agree to talk and then I go deep.</p>
<p>But there is an aspect to the way he talks about women</p>
<p>that while I understand,</p>
<p>and I understand certain dynamics</p>
<p>and relationships work for people</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s one of such person,</p>
<p>but I think him being really disrespectful towards women</p>
<p>is not how I see what it means to be a good man.</p>
<p>So the conversation I want to have with him</p>
<p>is about masculinity.</p>
<p>What does masculinity mean in the 21st century?</p>
<p>And so when I think about that kind of stuff,</p>
<p>and because we were talking about Twitter,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like going into a war zone.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like a happy go lucky person, but you&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>Send me to the Ukraine,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t want to have this conversation on Twitter.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s a really, really, really tricky one.</p>
<p>Because also, as you know, when you sit,</p>
<p>when you do a podcast,</p>
<p>everybody wants you to win.</p>
<p>Everything you do is positive.</p>
<p>Maybe you&rsquo;ll say the wrong thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like an inaccurate thing and you can correct yourself.</p>
<p>With Andrew Tate, with Donald Trump, with folks like this,</p>
<p>you have to, I mean, it&rsquo;s a professional boxing match.</p>
<p>You have to push the person.</p>
<p>You have to be really eloquent.</p>
<p>You have to be all sympathetic</p>
<p>because you can&rsquo;t just do what journalists do,</p>
<p>which is talk down to the person the entire time.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s easy.</p>
<p>The hard thing is to empathize with the person,</p>
<p>to understand them, to steel man their case,</p>
<p>but also to make your own case.</p>
<p>So in that case about what it means to be a man,</p>
<p>to me, a strong man is somebody who&rsquo;s respectful to women.</p>
<p>Not out of weakness, not out of social justice,</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re signaling and all that kind of stuff,</p>
<p>but out of that&rsquo;s what a strong man does.</p>
<p>Like they don&rsquo;t need to be disrespectful</p>
<p>to prove their position in life.</p>
<p>Now, a lot of people say it&rsquo;s a character.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s being misogynistic.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s being a misogynist for entertainment purposes.</p>
<p>So like an avatar.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But to me, that avatar has a lot of influence</p>
<p>on young folks.</p>
<p>So the character has impact.</p>
<p>No, I don&rsquo;t think you can separate the avatar</p>
<p>and the person in terms of the impact, as you said.</p>
<p>In fact, there are a number of accounts</p>
<p>on Twitter and Instagram and elsewhere,</p>
<p>which people have only revealed their first names</p>
<p>or they give themselves another name</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;re using a cartoon image.</p>
<p>And part of that, I believe,</p>
<p>and at least from some of these individuals</p>
<p>who actually know who they are,</p>
<p>I understand is A, an attempt to maintain their privacy,</p>
<p>which is important to many people.</p>
<p>And in some cases, so that they can be more inflammatory</p>
<p>and then just pop up elsewhere as something else</p>
<p>without anyone knowing that it&rsquo;s the same person.</p>
<p>Some of the, this is the dark stuff.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been reading a lot about Ukraine and Nazi Germany,</p>
<p>so the 30s and the 40s and so on.</p>
<p>And you get to see how much the absurdity</p>
<p>turns to evil quickly.</p>
<p>One of the things I worry,</p>
<p>one of the things I really don&rsquo;t like to see</p>
<p>on Twitter and the internet</p>
<p>is how many statements end with LOL.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like you think just because something is kind of funny</p>
<p>or is funny or is legitimately funny,</p>
<p>it also doesn&rsquo;t have a deep effect on society.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s such a difficult gray area</p>
<p>because some of the best comedy is dark and mean,</p>
<p>but it reveals some important truth</p>
<p>that we need to consider.</p>
<p>But sometimes comedy is just covering up</p>
<p>for destructive ideology.</p>
<p>And you have to know the line between those two.</p>
<p>Hitler was seen as a joke in the late 20s and the 30s,</p>
<p>the Nazi Germany, until the joke became very serious.</p>
<p>You have to be careful to know the difference</p>
<p>between the joke and the reality and do all that.</p>
<p>I mean, in a conversation,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just such a big believer in conversation</p>
<p>to be able to reveal something through conversation.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t know one of the big,</p>
<p>you and I challenge ourselves all the time.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if I have what it takes</p>
<p>to have a good, empathetic, but adversarial conversation.</p>
<p>I need to learn more about this Tate person</p>
<p>or not learn about him.</p>
<p>Yeah, it sounds like maybe it&rsquo;s something to skip.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know,</p>
<p>because again, I&rsquo;m not familiar with the content,</p>
<p>but I was going to ask you whether or not you&rsquo;ve seeked out</p>
<p>or whether or not you would ever consider having Donald Trump</p>
<p>as a guest on your podcast.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;ve talked to Joe a lot about this.</p>
<p>And I really believe I can have a good conversation</p>
<p>with Donald Trump,</p>
<p>but I haven&rsquo;t seen many good conversations with him.</p>
<p>So like part of me thinks, part of me believes it&rsquo;s possible,</p>
<p>but he often effectively runs over the interviewer.</p>
<p>Yeah, you can sit him down,</p>
<p>give him an element of athletic greens.</p>
<p>Just relax.</p>
<p>I mean, that nice, cool,</p>
<p>air-conditioned black curtain studio you&rsquo;ve got,</p>
<p>and a different side might come out.</p>
<p>Context is powerful.</p>
<p>Well, Joe&rsquo;s really good at this,</p>
<p>which is relaxing the person.</p>
<p>Like, here, have a drink, smoke a joint,</p>
<p>or whatever it is,</p>
<p>but this energy of just let&rsquo;s relax,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s laughter and so on.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think, as people know,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just not good at that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>So I think the way I could have a good conversation with him</p>
<p>is to really understand his worldview,</p>
<p>be able to steal man&rsquo;s worldview,</p>
<p>and those that support him,</p>
<p>which is, I&rsquo;m sorry to say,</p>
<p>for people who seem to hate Donald Trump,</p>
<p>is a very large percentage of the country.</p>
<p>And so you have to really empathize with those people.</p>
<p>You have to empathize with Donald Trump, the human being,</p>
<p>and from that perspective, ask him hard questions.</p>
<p>Who do you think is the counterpoint?</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re going to seek balance in your guests,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re going to have Trump on,</p>
<p>then you have to have who on?</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>Anthony Fauci?</p>
<p>Seems to be strongly associated with sort of counter values,</p>
<p>at least in the eye of the public.</p>
<p>I think he&rsquo;s retiring soon, but I, yeah,</p>
<p>I see he&rsquo;s retiring soon.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s really interesting, Anthony Fauci.</p>
<p>Yeah, definitely.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s a counterbalance.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a complicated, fascinating figure</p>
<p>who seems to have attracted a lot of hate and distrust,</p>
<p>but also-</p>
<p>And love from some people.</p>
<p>And love.</p>
<p>And love from some people.</p>
<p>I mean, I know people, not even necessarily scientists,</p>
<p>who have, you know, pro-Fauci shirts.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen people with anti-Fauci shirts, excuse me,</p>
<p>but certainly, but who adore him.</p>
<p>There are people who adore him,</p>
<p>in the same way there are people that adore Trump.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so interesting that, you know,</p>
<p>one species of animal gets such divergent neural circuitry.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost feels like it&rsquo;s by design</p>
<p>and every single topic we find tension and division.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fascinating to watch.</p>
<p>I mean, I got to really witness it</p>
<p>from zero to a hundred in Ukraine,</p>
<p>where there&rsquo;s not huge, significant division.</p>
<p>There was in certain parts of Ukraine,</p>
<p>but across Europe, across the world,</p>
<p>there was not that much division</p>
<p>between Russia and Ukraine.</p>
<p>And it was just born overnight, this intense hatred.</p>
<p>So, and you see the same kind of stuff</p>
<p>with Fauci over the pandemic.</p>
<p>At first, we&rsquo;re all kind of huddled in uncertainty,</p>
<p>kind of, there is a togetherness with a pandemic.</p>
<p>Of course, there is more difficult because you&rsquo;re isolated,</p>
<p>but then you start to figure out,</p>
<p>probably the politicians and the media</p>
<p>try to figure out, how can I take a side here?</p>
<p>And how can I now start reporting on this side or that side</p>
<p>and say how the other side is wrong?</p>
<p>And so I think Anthony Fauci is a part of just being used</p>
<p>as a scapegoat for certain things</p>
<p>as part of that kind of narrative of division.</p>
<p>But I think, so Trump is a singular figure</p>
<p>that to me represents something important</p>
<p>in American history.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure what that is,</p>
<p>but I think you have to think,</p>
<p>you put on your historian hat,</p>
<p>go forward in time and think back.</p>
<p>Like how will he be remembered 20, 30, 40, 50 years from now?</p>
<p>Who is the opposite of that?</p>
<p>You have to, I would really have to think about that</p>
<p>because Trump was so singular.</p>
<p>I think AOC is an interesting one,</p>
<p>but she&rsquo;s so young, it&rsquo;s unclear to know how,</p>
<p>if she represents a legitimately large-scale movement or not.</p>
<p>Bernie Sanders is an interesting option,</p>
<p>but I wish he would be 30, 40 years younger,</p>
<p>like the young Bernie would be a good.</p>
<p>There are scientists working on that.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think so.</p>
<p>Not him specifically, but.</p>
<p>Well, yeah, maybe him, we never know.</p>
<p>There is a big conspiracy theory that Putin is,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a body double, it&rsquo;s no longer.</p>
<p>Is Putin?</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m having a hard time emerging that image.</p>
<p>The conspiracy theory is no, no, no,</p>
<p>that the Putin you see on camera today is a body double.</p>
<p>Well, one thing that in science</p>
<p>and in particular in anatomy,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a classification scheme</p>
<p>for different types of anatomists,</p>
<p>which they either say you&rsquo;re a lumper or a splitter.</p>
<p>Some people like to call a whole structure something,</p>
<p>not necessarily just for simplicity,</p>
<p>but for a lot of reasons.</p>
<p>And then other people like to micro-divide the nucleus</p>
<p>into multiple names.</p>
<p>And of course, people used to be able</p>
<p>to name different brain structures after themselves.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;d be the nucleus of Lex</p>
<p>and then the Huberman fasciculus or whatever,</p>
<p>less of that nowadays.</p>
<p>But, and by the way,</p>
<p>those structures don&rsquo;t actually exist just yet.</p>
<p>We haven&rsquo;t defined those yet.</p>
<p>I was making those names up.</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s interesting is it seems like</p>
<p>in the last five years,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s been a lot of,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s been a trend, excuse me,</p>
<p>toward a requirement for lumping.</p>
<p>Like you can&rsquo;t say,</p>
<p>it seems that it&rsquo;s not allowed, if you will,</p>
<p>to say, hey, yeah, you know,</p>
<p>and here I&rsquo;m not stating my,</p>
<p>I will never reveal my preferences</p>
<p>about pandemic-related things</p>
<p>for hopefully obvious reasons.</p>
<p>It, you know, some people will say vaccines, yes,</p>
<p>but masks, no, or vaccines and masks, yes,</p>
<p>but let people work.</p>
<p>And other people will say, no, everyone stay home.</p>
<p>And then other people will say, no, you know,</p>
<p>no vaccines, no masks, let everybody work.</p>
<p>No one was saying no vaccines, no masks and stay home,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s this sort of lumping, right?</p>
<p>The boundaries around ideology</p>
<p>really did start to defy science.</p>
<p>I mean, it wasn&rsquo;t scientific.</p>
<p>It was one part science-ish at times,</p>
<p>and sometimes really hardcore science.</p>
<p>Other times it was politics, economics.</p>
<p>I mean, we really saw the confluence</p>
<p>of all these different domains of society</p>
<p>that use very different criteria to evaluate the world.</p>
<p>I mean, as a scientist, you know,</p>
<p>I remember when the vaccines first came out</p>
<p>and I asked somebody, you know,</p>
<p>one of the early concerns I had</p>
<p>that was actually satisfied for me</p>
<p>was how does this thing turn off?</p>
<p>You know, if you start generating mRNA,</p>
<p>how does it actually get turned off?</p>
<p>So I asked a friend, you know,</p>
<p>they know a lot about RNA biology and said,</p>
<p>you know, how does it turn off?</p>
<p>They explained it to me.</p>
<p>I was like, okay, makes sense.</p>
<p>I asked some other questions.</p>
<p>So, but most people aren&rsquo;t going to think about it</p>
<p>at that level of detail necessarily,</p>
<p>but it did seem that there was just kind of amorphous blobs</p>
<p>of ideology that grabbed onto things.</p>
<p>And then there was this need for a chasm between them.</p>
<p>It was almost felt like it became illegal in some ways</p>
<p>to want, you know, two of the things from that menu</p>
<p>and one of the things from that menu.</p>
<p>I really felt like I was being constrained</p>
<p>by a kind of like bento box model</p>
<p>where I didn&rsquo;t get to define what was in the bento box.</p>
<p>I can either add bento box A or bento box Z,</p>
<p>but nothing in between.</p>
<p>And I think on that topic,</p>
<p>and I think a lot of topics,</p>
<p>most people are in the middle with humility, uncertainty,</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re just kind of trying to figure it out.</p>
<p>And I think there is just the extremes</p>
<p>defining the nature of this division.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s the role of a lot of us</p>
<p>in our individual lives.</p>
<p>And also if you have a platform of any kind,</p>
<p>I think you have to try to walk in the middle,</p>
<p>like with the empathy and humility.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s actually what science is about, is the humility.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still thinking about who&rsquo;s the opposite of Trump.</p>
<p>Well, maybe it is not.</p>
<p>I mean, maybe Fauci is orthogonal to Trump.</p>
<p>I mean, not everything has an opposite.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s, you know, maybe he&rsquo;s an N of one.</p>
<p>Maybe he&rsquo;s in the minority of one</p>
<p>because he was an outsider from Washington</p>
<p>who then made it there.</p>
<p>But also I wonder, you know,</p>
<p>you have to pick your battles</p>
<p>because every battle you fight,</p>
<p>you should take very seriously.</p>
<p>And just the amount of hate I got,</p>
<p>and I still get for having sat down with the Pfizer CEO,</p>
<p>that was a very valuable lesson for me.</p>
<p>Well, that one got you a lot of heat.</p>
<p>Yeah, it still does.</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;ve had some pretty controversial guests on.</p>
<p>Yeah, but that one-</p>
<p>Is he still the Pfizer CEO?</p>
<p>I believe so.</p>
<p>CEOs turn over like crazy.</p>
<p>This is the thing I didn&rsquo;t realize, you know,</p>
<p>in science, if somebody moves institutions like a big deal,</p>
<p>most people don&rsquo;t have more than two moves in their career.</p>
<p>Maybe, but they often, you know,</p>
<p>move to the next building is a big deal.</p>
<p>But in biotech, it&rsquo;s like,</p>
<p>I have a former colleague of mine from San Diego,</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s been a CEO here, then he&rsquo;s a CEO there.</p>
<p>He went back to a company he was a CEO at before.</p>
<p>You know, he&rsquo;s probably back at the university</p>
<p>he worked at for all I know.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s amazing how much moving around there is.</p>
<p>It is a very itinerant profession.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think there, in certain companies,</p>
<p>I guess in biotech would be the case,</p>
<p>the CEO is more of like a manager type.</p>
<p>So you can, someone who&rsquo;s jumping around</p>
<p>benefits your experience.</p>
<p>So you get, become better and better being a manager.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s some like leader, revolutionary CEOs</p>
<p>that stick around for longer</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re so critical to pivoting a company</p>
<p>like the Microsoft CEO currently,</p>
<p>Sandra Brachai is somebody like that.</p>
<p>Obviously, Elon Musk is somebody like that,</p>
<p>that is part of pivoting a company</p>
<p>into new domains constantly.</p>
<p>But yeah, in biotech, there&rsquo;s a machine.</p>
<p>And in the eyes of a lot of people,</p>
<p>big pharma is like big tobacco.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the epitome of everything</p>
<p>that is wrong with capitalism.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s evil, right?</p>
<p>And so I showed up in the conversation</p>
<p>where I thought with a pretty open mind</p>
<p>and really asked what I thought</p>
<p>were difficult questions of him.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s ever sat down</p>
<p>to a grilling of that kind.</p>
<p>In fact, I&rsquo;m pretty sure they cut the interview short</p>
<p>because of that.</p>
<p>And I thought, literally it was hot in the room</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re sweating.</p>
<p>And I was asking tough questions</p>
<p>for somebody that like half the country</p>
<p>or a large percent of the country</p>
<p>believes he&rsquo;s alleviated a lot of,</p>
<p>he helped through the financial resources</p>
<p>that Pfizer has helped alleviate</p>
<p>a lot of suffering in the world.</p>
<p>And so I thought for somebody like that,</p>
<p>I was asking pretty hard questions.</p>
<p>Boy, did I get to hear from the side.</p>
<p>Usually one of the sides is more intense in their anger.</p>
<p>So there are certain political topics</p>
<p>like with Andrew Tate, for example,</p>
<p>I would hear from a very,</p>
<p>it would probably be the left,</p>
<p>far left that would write very angrily.</p>
<p>And so that&rsquo;s a group you&rsquo;ll hear from.</p>
<p>The Pfizer CEO, I didn&rsquo;t get almost any messages</p>
<p>from people saying, why did you go so hard on him?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s an incredible human, incredible leader</p>
<p>and CEO of a company that helped us with the vaccine</p>
<p>and nobody thought it would be possible</p>
<p>to develop so quickly.</p>
<p>You did not get letters of that sort.</p>
<p>I did not.</p>
<p>I mean, like here and there,</p>
<p>but the sea of people that said everything</p>
<p>from me being weak,</p>
<p>that I wasn&rsquo;t able to call out this person.</p>
<p>How do you sit down?</p>
<p>How do you platform this evil person?</p>
<p>How do you make him look human?</p>
<p>All that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>And that you have to deal with that.</p>
<p>You have to, of course, it&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>Because I have to do some soul searching,</p>
<p>which is like, did I?</p>
<p>Like you have to ask some hard questions.</p>
<p>I love criticism like that.</p>
<p>You get to like, you know, I hit some low points.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s definitely some despair</p>
<p>and you start to wonder like, was I too weak?</p>
<p>Should I have talked to him?</p>
<p>What is true?</p>
<p>And you sit there alone and just like marinate in that.</p>
<p>And hopefully over time that makes you better.</p>
<p>But I still don&rsquo;t know what the right answer</p>
<p>with that one is.</p>
<p>Well, I feel that money plays a role here.</p>
<p>You know, when people think big pharma,</p>
<p>they think billions of dollars,</p>
<p>maybe even trillions of dollars, really.</p>
<p>And certainly people who make a lot of money</p>
<p>get scrutiny that others don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Part of it is that they are often not always visible.</p>
<p>But I think that there is a natural and reflexive,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m not justifying it.</p>
<p>I certainly don&rsquo;t feel this</p>
<p>because I know some people who are very wealthy,</p>
<p>some people who are very poor.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t say it scales with happiness at all.</p>
<p>People are always shocked to hear that,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve observed in very wealthy people.</p>
<p>But that people who have a lot of money</p>
<p>are often held to a different standard</p>
<p>because people resent that.</p>
<p>Some people resent that,</p>
<p>and maybe there are other reasons as well.</p>
<p>I mean, among people who are very wealthy,</p>
<p>oftentimes the wish is for status, right, not money.</p>
<p>You get a bunch of billionaires in a room,</p>
<p>and unless one of them is Elon,</p>
<p>who also has immense status for his accomplishments,</p>
<p>typically if you put a Nobel Prize winner in a room</p>
<p>with a bunch of billionaires,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re all talking to that person, right?</p>
<p>And there are many very interesting billionaires.</p>
<p>But status is something that is often,</p>
<p>but not always associated with money,</p>
<p>but is a much rarer form of uniqueness out there,</p>
<p>a positive uniqueness, if one considers status positive,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s a downside too.</p>
<p>So I wonder whether or not the Pfizer CEO</p>
<p>caught extra heat because people assume,</p>
<p>and I probably assume also,</p>
<p>that his salary is quite immense.</p>
<p>So because I have a lot of data on this,</p>
<p>I can answer, it&rsquo;s a very good hypothesis.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s test it scientifically.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s about to tell me it&rsquo;s a great hypothesis,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s wrong.</p>
<p>I know the smirk, I know the smirk.</p>
<p>I honestly think it&rsquo;s wrong.</p>
<p>That effect is there for a lot of people,</p>
<p>but I think the distrust is not towards the CEO,</p>
<p>the distrust is towards the company.</p>
<p>One of the really difficult soul searching I had to do,</p>
<p>which is just having interacted with Pfizer folks</p>
<p>at every level from junior to the CEO,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re all really nice people.</p>
<p>They have a mission,</p>
<p>they talk about trying to really help people,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s the best way to make money</p>
<p>is come up with a medicine that helps a lot of people.</p>
<p>The mission is clear, they&rsquo;re all good people,</p>
<p>a lot of really brilliant people, PhDs.</p>
<p>So you can have a system where all the people are good,</p>
<p>including the CEO, and by good,</p>
<p>I mean people that really are trying to do everything,</p>
<p>they dedicate their whole life to do good.</p>
<p>And yet, you have to think that that system</p>
<p>can deviate from a path that does good,</p>
<p>because you start to deceive yourself of what is good,</p>
<p>you turn it into a game where money does come into play</p>
<p>from a company perspective,</p>
<p>where you convince yourself the more money you make,</p>
<p>the more good you&rsquo;ll be able to do,</p>
<p>and then you start to focus more and more and more</p>
<p>on making more money,</p>
<p>and then you can really deviate and lose track</p>
<p>of what is actually good.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying necessarily Pfizer does that,</p>
<p>but I think companies could do that.</p>
<p>You can apply that criticism to social media companies,</p>
<p>to big pharma companies,</p>
<p>that one of the big lessons for me,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s I don&rsquo;t know what the answer is,</p>
<p>but that all the people inside a company could be good,</p>
<p>people you would wanna hang out with,</p>
<p>people you&rsquo;d wanna work with,</p>
<p>but as a company is doing evil.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a possibility.</p>
<p>So the distrust I don&rsquo;t think</p>
<p>is towards the billionaire individual,</p>
<p>which I do see a lot of in this case,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s like Wall Street distrust,</p>
<p>that the machinery of this particular organization</p>
<p>has gone off track.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the generalization of hate again.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And then good luck figuring out what is true.</p>
<p>This is the tough stuff.</p>
<p>But I should say the individuals,</p>
<p>like individual scientists at the NIH and Pfizer,</p>
<p>are just incredible people.</p>
<p>Like they&rsquo;re really brilliant people.</p>
<p>So I never trust the administration</p>
<p>or the business people, no offense, business people,</p>
<p>but the scientists are always good.</p>
<p>They have the right motivator in life.</p>
<p>But again, they can have blinders on</p>
<p>to focus on the science.</p>
<p>Nazi Germany has a history of people</p>
<p>just to focus on the science.</p>
<p>And then the politicians use the scientists</p>
<p>to achieve whatever end they want.</p>
<p>But if you just look narrowly</p>
<p>at the journey of a scientist,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a beautiful one,</p>
<p>because they ultimately in it for the curiosity,</p>
<p>the moment of discovery versus money.</p>
<p>I mean, prestige probably does come into play</p>
<p>later in life, but especially young scientists,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re after the, it&rsquo;s like pulling at the thread</p>
<p>of curiosity to try to discover something big.</p>
<p>They get excited by that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s beautiful to see.</p>
<p>It is beautiful to see.</p>
<p>I have a former graduate student,</p>
<p>now a postdoc at Caltech.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t even know if she had a cell phone.</p>
<p>She would come into the lab,</p>
<p>put her cell phone into the desk,</p>
<p>and she was tremendously productive.</p>
<p>But that wasn&rsquo;t why I brought it up.</p>
<p>She was productive as a side effect</p>
<p>of just being absolutely committed and obsessed</p>
<p>to discover the answers to the questions she was asking.</p>
<p>As best she could.</p>
<p>And it was, you could feel it.</p>
<p>You could just feel the intensity</p>
<p>and just incredibly low activation energy.</p>
<p>If there was an experiment to do, she would just go do it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re teaching at MIT.</p>
<p>You are obviously traveling the world.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re running the podcast,</p>
<p>a lot of coverage of chess recently, which is interesting.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t play chess, but I-</p>
<p>Oh, I have some scientific questions to you about that.</p>
<p>Oh, okay, sure.</p>
<p>And then let&rsquo;s get to those for sure.</p>
<p>And then-</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not going to like it.</p>
<p>And then also some very,</p>
<p>do I have to spell Massachusetts again?</p>
<p>Also, you still seem to have a proclivity</p>
<p>for finding guests that are controversial, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re thinking about Tate, we&rsquo;re talking about Trump,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re talking about the Pfizer CEO,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re talking about Fauci.</p>
<p>These are intense people.</p>
<p>And so what we&rsquo;re getting, folks,</p>
<p>is we&rsquo;re not doing neuroimaging here</p>
<p>in the traditional sense of putting someone into a scanner.</p>
<p>What we&rsquo;re doing here is we&rsquo;re using</p>
<p>the great Karl Deisseroth, who was on your podcast.</p>
<p>Thank you for that.</p>
<p>Thank you for connecting us.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s an incredible person.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s an incredible psychiatrist, bioengineer,</p>
<p>and human being, and writer.</p>
<p>And your conversation with him was phenomenal.</p>
<p>I listened to it twice.</p>
<p>I actually have taken notes.</p>
<p>We talk about it in this household.</p>
<p>We really do.</p>
<p>His description of love is not to be missed.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just leave it at that</p>
<p>because if I try and say it, I won&rsquo;t capture it well.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re getting a language-based map</p>
<p>of at least a portion of Lex Friedman&rsquo;s brain here.</p>
<p>So what else is going on these days in that brain</p>
<p>as it relates to robotics, AI?</p>
<p>Our last conversation was a lot about robots</p>
<p>and the potential for robot-human interaction,</p>
<p>even what is a robot, et cetera.</p>
<p>Are you still working on robots or focused on robots?</p>
<p>And where is science showing up in your life</p>
<p>besides the things we&rsquo;ve already talked about?</p>
<p>So I think the last time we talked was before Ukraine.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>You were just about to leave.</p>
<p>Yes, so that, I mean-</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why I went on.</p>
<p>I was like, you know, this might be the last.</p>
<p>You said you want to come out here before or after.</p>
<p>I was like, I&rsquo;ll come out there before.</p>
<p>I want to see you before you go.</p>
<p>But here you are in the flesh.</p>
<p>I think, so a lot of,</p>
<p>just a lot of my mind has been occupied,</p>
<p>obviously with that part of the world.</p>
<p>But the most of the difficult struggles</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;m still going through is that</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t launched a company that I want to launch.</p>
<p>And the company has to do with AI.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s maybe a longer conversation,</p>
<p>but the ultimate dream is to put robots in every home.</p>
<p>But short-term, I see their possibility</p>
<p>of launching a social media company.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a non-trivial explanation</p>
<p>why that leads to robots in the home,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s basically the algorithms</p>
<p>that fuel effective social robotics.</p>
<p>So robots that you can form a deep connection with.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;ve been really, yeah, I&rsquo;ve been building prototypes</p>
<p>but struggling that I don&rsquo;t have maybe,</p>
<p>if I were to be critical, the guts to launch a company.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s-</p>
<p>Or the time.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s combined.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;ve got the guts.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s clear if you&rsquo;ll do an interview</p>
<p>with the Pfizer CEO,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re considering putting this Tate fellow</p>
<p>on your podcast, and you&rsquo;ve gone to the Ukraine,</p>
<p>that you have the guts.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also a, it means not doing quite a lot of other things.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I mean, but it does takes,</p>
<p>the thing is, as many people know,</p>
<p>when you fill your day and you&rsquo;re busy,</p>
<p>that busyness becomes an excuse</p>
<p>that you use against doing the things that scare you.</p>
<p>A lot of people use family in this way.</p>
<p>You know, my wife, my kids, I can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>When in reality, some of the most successful people</p>
<p>have a wife and have kids and have families,</p>
<p>and they still do it.</p>
<p>And so a lot of times we can fill the day with busy work,</p>
<p>with like, yeah, of course I have podcasts</p>
<p>and all this kind of stuff, and they make me happy.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re all, they&rsquo;re wonderful.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s research, there&rsquo;s teaching and so on,</p>
<p>but all of that can just serve as an excuse</p>
<p>from the thing that my heart says is the right thing to do.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why I don&rsquo;t have the guts,</p>
<p>the guts to say no to basically everything</p>
<p>and then to focus all out.</p>
<p>Because part of it is I&rsquo;m unlikely to fail</p>
<p>at anything in my life currently,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;ve already found a comfortable place.</p>
<p>With a startup, it&rsquo;s mostly going to be,</p>
<p>most likely going to be a failure,</p>
<p>if not an embarrassing failure.</p>
<p>So, well, the machine learning data that I&rsquo;m aware of,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know a lot about machine learning,</p>
<p>but within the realm of neuroscience,</p>
<p>say that a failure rate of about 15%</p>
<p>is optimal for neuroplasticity and growth.</p>
<p>Whether or not that translates to all kinds of practices</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t clear, but getting trials right 85% of the time</p>
<p>seems to be optimal for language learning,</p>
<p>seems to be optimal for mathematics</p>
<p>and seems to be optimal for physical pursuits,</p>
<p>on average, right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure you have more machine learning geeks</p>
<p>that listen to your podcast than listen to this podcast,</p>
<p>but it doesn&rsquo;t mean you have to fail</p>
<p>on 15% of your weight sets, folks.</p>
<p>I mean, it could be 16%.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m just kidding.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not exact, but it&rsquo;s a pretty good rule of thumb.</p>
<p>I think a lot of startup founders</p>
<p>would literally murder for 85% chance of success.</p>
<p>I think given all the opportunities I have,</p>
<p>the skillset, the funding, all that kind of stuff,</p>
<p>my chances are relatively high for success.</p>
<p>But what relatively high means in the startup world</p>
<p>is still far, far below 85.</p>
<p>We are talking about single digit percentages.</p>
<p>Most startups fail.</p>
<p>Well, I think it means the decision to focus on the company</p>
<p>and not other things means the decision</p>
<p>to close the hatch on dopamine retrieval</p>
<p>from all these other things</p>
<p>that are very predictable sources of dopamine.</p>
<p>Not that everything is dopamine,</p>
<p>but dopamine is, I think,</p>
<p>the primary chemical driver of motivation.</p>
<p>If you know that you can get some degree of satisfaction</p>
<p>from scrolling social media</p>
<p>or from that particular cup of coffee,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re going to do.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re going to consume</p>
<p>unless you somehow invert the algorithm</p>
<p>and you say, it&rsquo;s actually my denial of myself</p>
<p>drinking that coffee that&rsquo;s going to be the dopamine.</p>
<p>Then, and that&rsquo;s the beauty of having a forebrain</p>
<p>is that you can make those decisions.</p>
<p>This is the essence, I do believe,</p>
<p>of what we see of David Goggins.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s much more there.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a person that none of us know</p>
<p>and only he knows, of course,</p>
<p>but the idea that the pain is the source of dopamine,</p>
<p>the limbic friction, as I sometimes like to call it,</p>
<p>is the source of dopamine,</p>
<p>that runs counter to how most nervous systems work,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s decision-based, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not because his musculature is a certain way</p>
<p>or he had CRISPR or something.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because he decides that.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s amazing,</p>
<p>but what it means in terms of starting a company</p>
<p>and changing priorities is closing the hatch</p>
<p>on all or many of the current sources of dopamine</p>
<p>so that you can derive dopamine from the failures</p>
<p>within this narrow context.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a very reductionist view,</p>
<p>kind of neurocentric view of what we&rsquo;re talking about,</p>
<p>but I think about this a lot.</p>
<p>I mean, the decision to choose one relationship</p>
<p>versus another is a decision to close down</p>
<p>other opportunities, right?</p>
<p>So I think that the decision to order one thing</p>
<p>off the menu versus others is this decision</p>
<p>to close down those other hatches.</p>
<p>So I think that you absolutely can do it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a question of, can you flip the algorithm?</p>
<p>Yeah, remap the source of dopamine to something else.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>And maybe go out there not to succeed,</p>
<p>but make the journey as the destination type thing.</p>
<p>But when you&rsquo;re financially vested and your time,</p>
<p>and as far as I know, we only get one life,</p>
<p>at least on this planet,</p>
<p>and you want to spend that wisely, right?</p>
<p>And a lot of the people that surround you,</p>
<p>people are really important.</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t have people around me</p>
<p>that say you should do a startup.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very difficult to find such people.</p>
<p>Because-</p>
<p>Is Austin big startup culture right now?</p>
<p>Yeah, it is, it is.</p>
<p>But it doesn&rsquo;t make sense for me to do a startup.</p>
<p>This is what the people that love me,</p>
<p>my whole life have been telling me,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t make sense what you&rsquo;re doing right now.</p>
<p>Just do the thing you were doing previously.</p>
<p>Why do I get the sense</p>
<p>that because they are saying this,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re apt to go against them?</p>
<p>No, actually, it was never that, unfortunately.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I need,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked to people I love,</p>
<p>my parents, family, and so on, friends.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m one of those people that needs unconditional support</p>
<p>for difficult things.</p>
<p>Like I know myself coaching wise.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how I get coached best.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say wrestling.</p>
<p>Like a coach that says, you want to win the Olympics?</p>
<p>They will not force,</p>
<p>if I say I want to win the gold medal</p>
<p>at the Olympics in freestyle wrestling.</p>
<p>I want a coach that doesn&rsquo;t blink once</p>
<p>and hears me and believes that I can do it.</p>
<p>And then is viciously intense and cruel to me</p>
<p>on that pursuit.</p>
<p>Like if you want to do this, let&rsquo;s do this, right?</p>
<p>So, but that&rsquo;s support.</p>
<p>That like that positivity, I don&rsquo;t,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m never, you know,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not energized, nor do I see that as love.</p>
<p>A person saying like, basically criticizing that,</p>
<p>like saying like, you&rsquo;re too old</p>
<p>to win the Olympic gold medal, right?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re like all the things you can come up with.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not helpful to me.</p>
<p>And I can&rsquo;t find a dopamine,</p>
<p>or I haven&rsquo;t yet a dopamine source from the haters.</p>
<p>Like basically people that are criticizing you,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re just trying to prove them wrong.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t, it never got me off.</p>
<p>It never.</p>
<p>Well, some people seem to like that.</p>
<p>I mean, David Goggins always seems to come out.</p>
<p>He seems driven by many sources that he has access.</p>
<p>I do, I don&rsquo;t know, because I&rsquo;ve never asked him,</p>
<p>but I, if I were to venture a guess,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say that he probably has a lot of options</p>
<p>inside his head as to how to push through challenge,</p>
<p>not just overcome pain, not,</p>
<p>but he&rsquo;ll post sometimes about the fact that, you know,</p>
<p>people will say this, or people will do this,</p>
<p>and talk about the pushback approach.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;ll also talk about the pushback approach</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s purely internal, that doesn&rsquo;t involve anyone else.</p>
<p>Great versatility there.</p>
<p>Yeah, there&rsquo;s literally like a voice he yells at</p>
<p>that represents some kind of like devil</p>
<p>that wants him to fail.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s, you know, he calls him bitch</p>
<p>and all kinds of things saying, you know, fuck you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not, I&rsquo;m not.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s always like an enemy</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s going against that enemy.</p>
<p>And I wish, maybe that&rsquo;s something,</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s really interesting.</p>
<p>Maybe you can remap it this way so that you can construct,</p>
<p>like that&rsquo;s a kind of obvious mechanism,</p>
<p>construct an amorphous blob that is a hater</p>
<p>that wants you to fail, right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s kind of the David Goggins thing.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re in that blob says you&rsquo;re too weak,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re too dumb, you&rsquo;re too old,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re too fat, you&rsquo;re too whatever,</p>
<p>and getting you to want to quit and so on.</p>
<p>And then you start getting angry at that blob</p>
<p>and maybe that&rsquo;s a good motivator.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t personally really tried that.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;ve had external, you know, challenge</p>
<p>when I was a postdoc, a very prominent laboratory,</p>
<p>several prominent laboratories, in fact,</p>
<p>were working on the same thing that I was.</p>
<p>And I was just a slowly postdoc working on a project</p>
<p>pretty independent from the lab I was in.</p>
<p>And there was competition,</p>
<p>but there was plenty of room for everybody to win.</p>
<p>But in my head, and frankly,</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t disclose who this is,</p>
<p>and because there was some legitimate competition there</p>
<p>and a little bit of friction, not too much,</p>
<p>healthy scientific friction.</p>
<p>Yeah, I might&rsquo;ve pushed a few extra hours</p>
<p>or more, a little bit.</p>
<p>I have to say it felt metabolizing.</p>
<p>It felt catabolic, right?</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t, I couldn&rsquo;t be sustained by it.</p>
<p>And I contrast that with the podcast</p>
<p>or the work that my laboratory is doing now,</p>
<p>focus on stress and human performance, et cetera.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s pure love.</p>
<p>I just, I want, it&rsquo;s pure curiosity and love.</p>
<p>I mean, there are hard days, but I never,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no adversary in the picture.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re the practical, you know, workings of life that-</p>
<p>Those are the thing that Joe really inspired me on.</p>
<p>And people do create adversarial relationships</p>
<p>in podcasting because you get, like YouTubers do this.</p>
<p>They get, you know,</p>
<p>they hate seeing somebody else be successful.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a feeling of like,</p>
<p>like jealousy.</p>
<p>And some people even see that as healthy.</p>
<p>Like, ooh, this, like MrBeast or somebody,</p>
<p>some of these popular YouTubers,</p>
<p>how do they get a hundred million views?</p>
<p>And I only get 20 views.</p>
<p>MrBeast devoted his entire, according to him,</p>
<p>his entire life, he&rsquo;s been focused on becoming</p>
<p>this massive YouTube channel.</p>
<p>Well that, you know, he&rsquo;s inspiring in many ways,</p>
<p>but like there&rsquo;s some people that get,</p>
<p>become famous for doing much less insane pursuit</p>
<p>of greatness than MrBeast.</p>
<p>Like there&rsquo;s people become famous on, you know,</p>
<p>on social media and so on.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s easy to be jealous of them.</p>
<p>I just, one of the early things I&rsquo;ve learned from Joe,</p>
<p>just being a fan of his podcast</p>
<p>is how much he celebrated everybody.</p>
<p>And I, again, maybe I ruined my whole dopamine thing,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t get energized by people that become popular.</p>
<p>The podcasting space and YouTube, it doesn&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s awesome.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all of it is awesome.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m inspired by that.</p>
<p>But the problem is that&rsquo;s not a good motivator.</p>
<p>Inspiration is like, ooh, cool, humans can do this.</p>
<p>This is beautiful, but it&rsquo;s not, I&rsquo;m looking,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking, you know, for a forcing function.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I gave away the salary from MIT.</p>
<p>I was hoping my bank account would hit zero.</p>
<p>That would be a forcing function to be like, oh shit.</p>
<p>And I will, you know,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re not allowed to have a normal job.</p>
<p>So I wanted to launch, and then the podcast becomes,</p>
<p>you know, a source of income.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s like, God damn it.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Well, you know, and here I have to confess my biases.</p>
<p>You are so good at what you do in the realm of podcast</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re excellent at other things as well.</p>
<p>I just have less experience in those things.</p>
<p>I know here I&rsquo;m taking the liberty of speaking</p>
<p>for many, many people and just saying,</p>
<p>I sure as hell hope you don&rsquo;t shut down the podcast,</p>
<p>but as your friend and as somebody who cares very deeply</p>
<p>about your happiness and your deeper satisfaction,</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s in your heart&rsquo;s heart to do a company,</p>
<p>well then damn it, do the company.</p>
<p>And a lot of it, I wouldn&rsquo;t even categorize as happiness.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you have things like that in your life,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m probably the happiest I could possibly be right now.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s wonderful.</p>
<p>But the thing is, there&rsquo;s a longing for the startup</p>
<p>that has nothing to do with happiness.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s something else.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s that itch.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pretty sure I&rsquo;ll be less happy</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s a really tough process.</p>
<p>I mean, to whatever degree you can extract happiness</p>
<p>from struggle, yes, maybe, but I don&rsquo;t see it.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;ll have some very, very low points.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of people who find companies,</p>
<p>found companies, know about your,</p>
<p>and I also want to be in a relationship.</p>
<p>I want to get married and sure as hell,</p>
<p>a startup is not gonna increase the likelihood of that.</p>
<p>We could start up a family and start a company.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a huge believer in that,</p>
<p>which is getting a relationship at a low point in your life,</p>
<p>which is.</p>
<p>Sorry, I&rsquo;m not disputing your stance,</p>
<p>nor am I agreeing with it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just every once in a while,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a Lex Friedman-ism</p>
<p>that hits a particular circuit in my brain.</p>
<p>I have to just laugh out loud.</p>
<p>I just think that it&rsquo;s easy to have a relationship</p>
<p>when everything is good.</p>
<p>The relationships that become strong</p>
<p>and are tested quickly are the ones</p>
<p>when shit is going down.</p>
<p>Well, then there&rsquo;s hope for me yet.</p>
<p>Oh, so, you know, before we sat down,</p>
<p>I was having a conversation with a podcast producer</p>
<p>who is a, I wouldn&rsquo;t say avid,</p>
<p>rather he&rsquo;s a rabid consumer of podcasts</p>
<p>and finds these amazing podcasts.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s small podcasts and, you know, and unique episodes.</p>
<p>Anyway, we were talking about some stuff</p>
<p>that he had seen and read in the business sector.</p>
<p>And he was talking about the difference</p>
<p>between, you know, job, career, and a calling, right?</p>
<p>And I think he was extracting this from conversations</p>
<p>of CEOs and founders, et cetera.</p>
<p>I forget the specific founders</p>
<p>that brought this to light for him.</p>
<p>But, you know, this idea that if you focus on a job,</p>
<p>you know, you can make an income</p>
<p>and hopefully you enjoy your job or not hate it too much.</p>
<p>A career represents a sort of, in my mind,</p>
<p>a kind of series of evolutions</p>
<p>that one can go through, junior professor, tenure, et cetera.</p>
<p>But a calling has a whole other level</p>
<p>of energetic pull to it because it includes career and job</p>
<p>and it includes this concept of sort of like a life.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very hard to draw the line between a calling in career</p>
<p>and a calling in the other parts of your life.</p>
<p>So the question therefore is,</p>
<p>do you feel a calling to start this company?</p>
<p>Or is it more of a compulsion that irritates you?</p>
<p>Is it like something you wish would go away?</p>
<p>Or is it something that you hope will won&rsquo;t go away?</p>
<p>No, I hope it won&rsquo;t go away.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a calling.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a calling.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like-</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s beautiful.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, when I see a robot,</p>
<p>when I first interacted with robots</p>
<p>and it became even stronger,</p>
<p>the most sophisticated of the robots I interacted with,</p>
<p>I see a magic there.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re like, you look around,</p>
<p>does anyone else see this magic?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of like maybe when you fall in love,</p>
<p>that feeling like, does anyone else notice this person</p>
<p>I just walk in the room?</p>
<p>I feel that way about robots.</p>
<p>And I can elaborate what that means,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m not even sure I can convert it into words.</p>
<p>I just feel like the social integration of robots</p>
<p>in society will create a really interesting world.</p>
<p>And our ability to anthropomorphize</p>
<p>when we look at a robot</p>
<p>and our ability to feel things when we look at a robot</p>
<p>is something that most of us don&rsquo;t yet experience,</p>
<p>but I think everybody will experience</p>
<p>in the next few decades.</p>
<p>And I just want to be a part of exploring that</p>
<p>because it hasn&rsquo;t been really thoroughly explored.</p>
<p>The best roboticists in the world</p>
<p>are not currently working on that problem at all.</p>
<p>They try to avoid human beings completely.</p>
<p>And nobody&rsquo;s really working on that problem</p>
<p>in terms of when you look at the numbers,</p>
<p>all the big tech companies that are investing money,</p>
<p>the closest thing to that is Alexa</p>
<p>and basically being a servant to help tell you the weather,</p>
<p>play music and so on.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not trying to form a deep connection.</p>
<p>And so sometimes you just notice the thing.</p>
<p>Not only do I notice the magic,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a gut feeling, which I try not to speak to</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s no track record,</p>
<p>but I feel like I can be good</p>
<p>at bringing that magic out of the robot.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s no data that says I would be good at that,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a feeling, it&rsquo;s just a feeling.</p>
<p>Like I, you know, when I,</p>
<p>cause I&rsquo;ve done so many things.</p>
<p>I love doing, playing guitar, all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Jiu-Jitsu, I&rsquo;ve never felt that feeling.</p>
<p>When I&rsquo;m doing jiu-jitsu,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t feel the magic of the genius</p>
<p>required to be extremely good.</p>
<p>A guitar, I don&rsquo;t feel any of that,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;ve noticed it in others.</p>
<p>Great musicians, they will,</p>
<p>they notice the magic about the thing they do</p>
<p>and they ran with it.</p>
<p>And I just always thought,</p>
<p>I think it had a different form</p>
<p>when I, before I knew robots existed, before AI existed,</p>
<p>the form was more about the magic between humans.</p>
<p>The like, I think of it as love,</p>
<p>but like the smile the two friends have towards each other</p>
<p>when I was really young and people would be excited</p>
<p>when they first know each other and see, notice each other.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s that moment that they share</p>
<p>that feeling together.</p>
<p>I was like, wow, that&rsquo;s really interesting.</p>
<p>It is really interesting</p>
<p>that these two separate intelligent organisms</p>
<p>are able to connect all of a sudden</p>
<p>on this deep emotional level.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, huh, it&rsquo;s just beautiful to see.</p>
<p>And I noticed the magic of that.</p>
<p>And then when I started programming,</p>
<p>programming period, but then programming AI systems,</p>
<p>you realize, oh, that could be,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not just between humans and humans,</p>
<p>that could be humans and other entities,</p>
<p>dogs, cats, and robots.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s, so I, for some reason,</p>
<p>it hit me the most intensely when I saw robots.</p>
<p>And so, yeah, it&rsquo;s like a calling,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a calling that I can just enjoy</p>
<p>the vision of it, the vision of a future world,</p>
<p>of an exciting future world that&rsquo;s full of cool stuff,</p>
<p>or I can be part of building that.</p>
<p>And being part of building that means doing</p>
<p>the hard work of capitalism,</p>
<p>which is like raising funds from people,</p>
<p>which for me right now is the easy part,</p>
<p>and then hiring a lot of people.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how much you know about hiring,</p>
<p>but hiring-</p>
<p>Excellent people.</p>
<p>Excellent people that will define the trajectory</p>
<p>of not only your company,</p>
<p>but your whole existence as a human being,</p>
<p>and building it up, not failing them,</p>
<p>because now they all depend on you,</p>
<p>and not failing the world with an opportunity</p>
<p>to bring something that brings joy to people.</p>
<p>And like all that pressure,</p>
<p>just nonstop fires that you have to put out,</p>
<p>the drama, having to work with people</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ve never worked with,</p>
<p>like lawyers, and the human resources,</p>
<p>and supply chain, and because this is very compute heavy,</p>
<p>the compute infrastructure, managing, security,</p>
<p>cybersecurity, is because you&rsquo;re dealing</p>
<p>with people&rsquo;s data.</p>
<p>So now you have to understand not only</p>
<p>the cybersecurity of data, and the privacy,</p>
<p>how to maintain privacy correctly with data,</p>
<p>but also the psychology of people trusting you</p>
<p>with their data.</p>
<p>And what is, how, if you look at Mark Zuckerberg,</p>
<p>and Jack Dorsey, and those folks,</p>
<p>they seem to be hated by a large number of people.</p>
<p>Jack seemed, I didn&rsquo;t, you know, I didn&rsquo;t-</p>
<p>Much less so, yes.</p>
<p>I think, I always think of Jack as a loved individual, but-</p>
<p>Well, you have a very positive view of the world, yes.</p>
<p>I like Jack a lot, and I like his mind,</p>
<p>and I, someone close to him described him to me recently</p>
<p>as he&rsquo;s an excellent listener.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what they said about Jack,</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s my experience of him too.</p>
<p>A very private person, so we&rsquo;ll leave it at that.</p>
<p>But listen, I think Jack Dorsey is one of the greats</p>
<p>of our, of the last 200 years,</p>
<p>and is just much quieter about his stance on things</p>
<p>than a lot of people.</p>
<p>But much of what we see in the world, that&rsquo;s wonderful.</p>
<p>I think we owe him a debt of gratitude.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just voicing my stance here, but-</p>
<p>The person, this is really important.</p>
<p>A wonderful person, a brilliant person, a good person,</p>
<p>but you still have to pay the price</p>
<p>of making any kind of mistakes as the head of a company.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t get any extra bonus points</p>
<p>for being a good person.</p>
<p>But his willingness to go on Rogan and deal directly</p>
<p>and say, I don&rsquo;t know an answer to that in some cases,</p>
<p>but to deal directly with some really challenging questions</p>
<p>to me earned him tremendous respect.</p>
<p>Yes, as an individual, he was still part of them is,</p>
<p>so you&rsquo;ve said, and I love Jack too,</p>
<p>and I interact with him often.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s been on your podcast.</p>
<p>Yes, but he&rsquo;s also part of a system as we&rsquo;ve talked about.</p>
<p>And I would argue that Jack shouldn&rsquo;t have brought</p>
<p>anyone else with him on that podcast.</p>
<p>If you go-</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s right, he had a cadre of-</p>
<p>Oh, he had, I guess, the head legal with him.</p>
<p>And also it requires a tremendous amount of skill</p>
<p>to go on a podcast like Joe Rogan</p>
<p>and be able to win over the trust of people</p>
<p>by being able to be transparent</p>
<p>and communicate how the company really works.</p>
<p>Because the more you reveal</p>
<p>about how a social media company works,</p>
<p>the more you open up for security,</p>
<p>the vector of attacks increases.</p>
<p>Also, there&rsquo;s a lot of difficult decisions</p>
<p>in terms of censorship and not that are made,</p>
<p>that if you make them transparent,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re gonna get an order of magnitude more hate.</p>
<p>So you have to make all those kinds of decisions.</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s one of the things I have to realize</p>
<p>is you have to take that avalanche of potential</p>
<p>hate if you make mistakes.</p>
<p>Well, you have a very clear picture</p>
<p>of this architecture of what&rsquo;s required</p>
<p>in order to create a company.</p>
<p>Of course, there&rsquo;s division of labor too.</p>
<p>I mean, you don&rsquo;t have to do all of those things in detail,</p>
<p>but finding people that are excellent to do the,</p>
<p>you know, to run the critical segments is obviously key.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just say what I said earlier,</p>
<p>which is if it&rsquo;s in your heart&rsquo;s heart to start a company,</p>
<p>if that indeed is your calling and it sounds like it is,</p>
<p>then I can&rsquo;t wait.</p>
<p>Does a heart have a heart?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s that expression even mean?</p>
<p>Probably not.</p>
<p>In my lab at one point, early days,</p>
<p>we worked on cuttlefish and they have multiple hearts</p>
<p>and they pump green blood, believe it or not,</p>
<p>very fascinating animal.</p>
<p>Speaking of hearts and green blood,</p>
<p>earlier today before we sat down,</p>
<p>I solicited for questions on Instagram and a brief post.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;ll-</p>
<p>Do you want to look at some of them?</p>
<p>Yes, let&rsquo;s take these in real time.</p>
<p>My podcast team is always teasing me</p>
<p>that I never have any charge on my phone.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m one of these people that likes to run in the yellow</p>
<p>or whatever it is on the phone.</p>
<p>An iPhone?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny how always the iPhone people are out of battery.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s weird.</p>
<p>I just got a new one.</p>
<p>I mean, this one has plenty of battery.</p>
<p>I just got a new one.</p>
<p>So I have different numbers for different things,</p>
<p>personal and work, et cetera.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying that now.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Get into the-</p>
<p>I have a chess thing too to mention to you.</p>
<p>Oh yes, please.</p>
<p>Will I insult you if I look up these questions</p>
<p>as you ask me?</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>No, no, but I will insult you by asking this question</p>
<p>because I think it&rsquo;s hilarious.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s been a controversy about cheating</p>
<p>where Hans Niemann, who&rsquo;s a 2700 player-</p>
<p>Oh yeah.</p>
<p>I just saw that clip on your Clips channel.</p>
<p>By the way, I love your Clips channel,</p>
<p>but I listen to your full channel.</p>
<p>The big accusation is that he cheated by having,</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s half joke,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s starting to get me to wonder whether,</p>
<p>so that you can cheat by having vibrating anal beads.</p>
<p>So you can send messages to-</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s rephrase that statement.</p>
<p>Not you can, but one can.</p>
<p>One can.</p>
<p>One can.</p>
<p>That was a personal attack, yes.</p>
<p>But it made me realize, I mean-</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just gonna adjust myself in my seat here.</p>
<p>I use it all the time for podcastings</p>
<p>to send myself messages, to remind me myself of notes.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p>I mean, it-</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not gonna call you again.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s exactly where I keep my phone.</p>
<p>It did get me down this whole rabbit hole of,</p>
<p>well, how would you be able to send communication</p>
<p>in order to cheat in different sports?</p>
<p>I mean, that doesn&rsquo;t even have to do</p>
<p>with chess in particular,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s interesting in chess and poker</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s mechanisms sort of modern day</p>
<p>where you&rsquo;re streaming live the competition.</p>
<p>So people can watch it on TV.</p>
<p>If they can only send you a signal back,</p>
<p>they, you know, it&rsquo;s just like a fun little thing</p>
<p>to think about and if it&rsquo;s possible to pull off.</p>
<p>So I wanted to get your scientific evaluation</p>
<p>of that technique.</p>
<p>To cheat using some sort of interoceptive device.</p>
<p>Yeah, vibrating of some kind, yeah.</p>
<p>Well, no, no, that&rsquo;s one way to send signals</p>
<p>is like Morse code, basically.</p>
<p>Yeah, so there&rsquo;s a famous,</p>
<p>I believe there&rsquo;s a famous real world story</p>
<p>of physics students.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna get some of this wrong.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m saying this in kind of a course form</p>
<p>so that somebody will correct this.</p>
<p>But I believe it was physics graduate students</p>
<p>from UC Santa Cruz or somewhere else.</p>
<p>Maybe it was Caltech, a bunch of universities</p>
<p>so that no one, you know,</p>
<p>associates with any one university that went to Vegas</p>
<p>and used some sort of tactile device</p>
<p>for kind of card counting, I think.</p>
<p>This was actually demonstrated also,</p>
<p>not this particular incident, I don&rsquo;t think,</p>
<p>in the movie Casino,</p>
<p>where they spotted, I remember Robert De Niro,</p>
<p>who you have a not so vague resemblance to, by the way,</p>
<p>in Taxi Driver.</p>
<p>God, I wish I had a De Niro impression right now.</p>
<p>Travis Bickle.</p>
<p>Look it up, folks.</p>
<p>Travis Bickle is, you know,</p>
<p>if Lex ever shaved his head into a mohawk.</p>
<p>I would.</p>
<p>So he had a tapping device on his ankle that was signaling,</p>
<p>someone else was counting cards</p>
<p>and then signaling to that person.</p>
<p>So yeah, that could be done in the tactile way.</p>
<p>It could be done, obviously, earpieces,</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s deep earpiece.</p>
<p>I think that there are ways that they look for that.</p>
<p>Certainly any kind of vibrational device</p>
<p>in whatever orifice,</p>
<p>provided someone could pay attention to that</p>
<p>while still playing the game.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think it&rsquo;s entirely possible.</p>
<p>Now, could it be done purely neurally?</p>
<p>You know, could there be something that was,</p>
<p>and listen, it wouldn&rsquo;t have to even be below the skull.</p>
<p>This is where whenever people hear about Neuralink</p>
<p>or brain machine interface,</p>
<p>they always think, oh, you have to drill down</p>
<p>below the skull and put a chip into the skull.</p>
<p>I think there are people walking around nowadays</p>
<p>with glucose monitoring devices, like Levels,</p>
<p>which I&rsquo;ve used, and it was very informative for me,</p>
<p>actually, as a kind of an experiment,</p>
<p>gave me a lot of interesting insights</p>
<p>about my blood sugar regulation,</p>
<p>how it reacts to different foods, et cetera.</p>
<p>Well, you know, you can implant a tactile device</p>
<p>below the skin with a simple incision.</p>
<p>Actually, one of the neurosurgeons at Neuralink,</p>
<p>I know well, because he came up at some point</p>
<p>through my laboratory and was at Stanford,</p>
<p>and he actually has put in a radio receiver in his hand,</p>
<p>and his wife has it too, and he can open locks</p>
<p>of his house and things like that.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s been doing-</p>
<p>Under the skin?</p>
<p>Under the skin.</p>
<p>You know, you can go to-</p>
<p>How does that work?</p>
<p>So how do you-</p>
<p>A piercer.</p>
<p>You go to a, you know, a body piercer type person,</p>
<p>and they can just slide it under there,</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s got a battery life of something,</p>
<p>and you know, some fairly long duration.</p>
<p>How do you experience the tactile, the haptics of it?</p>
<p>Oh, no, that just allows him to open certain locks</p>
<p>with just his hand,</p>
<p>but you could easily put some sort of tactile device</p>
<p>in there.</p>
<p>But does it have to connect to the nerves,</p>
<p>or is it just like, just vibration?</p>
<p>No, just vibration, and you know-</p>
<p>And you can probably sense it,</p>
<p>even if it&rsquo;s under the skin, I wonder.</p>
<p>And it can be by, it can be Bluetooth linked.</p>
<p>I mean, you know, I&rsquo;ve seen,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a engineering laboratory</p>
<p>at the University of Illinois, Champaign-Urbana,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s got an amazing device,</p>
<p>which is about the size of a Band-Aid.</p>
<p>It goes on the clavicles,</p>
<p>and it uses sound waves pinged into the body</p>
<p>to measure cavitation.</p>
<p>Now think about this for a moment.</p>
<p>This is being used in the military,</p>
<p>where let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re leading an operation</p>
<p>or something, people are getting shot, shot at,</p>
<p>and on a laptop,</p>
<p>you can see where the bullet entry points are.</p>
<p>Are people dead?</p>
<p>Are they bleeding out?</p>
<p>You know, entry exit points.</p>
<p>You can get, take it out of the battlefield scenario,</p>
<p>you can get breathing, body position, 24 hours a day.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so much that you can do looking at cavitation.</p>
<p>These same sorts of devices on 12-hour Bluetooth</p>
<p>could be used to send all sorts of,</p>
<p>maybe every time you&rsquo;re supposed to hold your hand,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a good gambler,</p>
<p>so I only play roulette when I go to Vegas</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re just long, boring, and, you know, games,</p>
<p>but you get some good mileage out of each run, usually.</p>
<p>But the, you know, maybe every time you&rsquo;re supposed to hold,</p>
<p>the person gets sort of like a stomach cinching</p>
<p>because this is, you know,</p>
<p>stimulating the vagus a little bit,</p>
<p>and they get a little bit of an ache.</p>
<p>So it doesn&rsquo;t have to be Morse code.</p>
<p>It can be yes, no, maybe, right?</p>
<p>It can be, you know,</p>
<p>it can be a green, red, yellow type signaling.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t have to be very sophisticated</p>
<p>to give somebody a significant advantage.</p>
<p>Anyway, I haven&rsquo;t thought about this in detail</p>
<p>before this conversation,</p>
<p>but, oh yeah, there&rsquo;s an immense landscape.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you know a poker player named Phil Ivey.</p>
<p>No, I don&rsquo;t follow the gambling.</p>
<p>Well, he&rsquo;s considered to be</p>
<p>one of the greatest poker players of all time.</p>
<p>Legitimately, you know, he&rsquo;s just incredibly good,</p>
<p>but he got,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s this big case where he was accused of cheating</p>
<p>and proven, and it&rsquo;s not really cheating,</p>
<p>which is what&rsquo;s really fascinating,</p>
<p>is it turns out, so he plays poker at Texas Hold&rsquo;em mostly,</p>
<p>but all kinds of poker.</p>
<p>It turns out that the grid on the back of the cards</p>
<p>is often printed a little bit imperfectly.</p>
<p>And so you can use the asymmetry of the imperfections</p>
<p>to try to figure out certain cards.</p>
<p>So if you play and you remember that a certain card</p>
<p>is like, I think the eight in that deck</p>
<p>that he was accused of, an eight and nine,</p>
<p>or slightly different, symmetry-wise.</p>
<p>So he can now ask the dealer actually to rotate it</p>
<p>to check the symmetry.</p>
<p>So he would ask the dealer to rotate the card</p>
<p>to see that there&rsquo;s, to detect the asymmetry</p>
<p>of the back of the card.</p>
<p>And now he knows which cards are eights and nines,</p>
<p>and, or likelier to be eights and nines.</p>
<p>And he was using that information to play poker</p>
<p>and win a lot of money, but it&rsquo;s just a slight advantage.</p>
<p>And his cases, and in fact, the judge found this,</p>
<p>that he&rsquo;s not actually cheating, but it&rsquo;s not right.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t use this kind of extra information.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s fascinating that you can discover</p>
<p>these little holes in games</p>
<p>if you pay close enough attention.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s fascinating.</p>
<p>And I think that, you know, I did watch that clip</p>
<p>about the potential of a cheating event in chess</p>
<p>and the fact that a number of chess players</p>
<p>admit to cheating at some point in their career.</p>
<p>Very, very interesting.</p>
<p>Well, it was online.</p>
<p>So online cheating is easier, right?</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re playing, online cheating in a game</p>
<p>where the machine is much better than the human,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very difficult to prove that you&rsquo;re human.</p>
<p>And that applies, by the way,</p>
<p>another really big thing is in social media, the bots.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re running a social media company,</p>
<p>you have to deal with the bots.</p>
<p>And they become one of the really exciting things</p>
<p>in machine learning and artificial intelligence to me</p>
<p>is the very fast improvement of language models.</p>
<p>So neural networks that generate text,</p>
<p>then interpret text, that generate from text images</p>
<p>and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re now going to create incredible bots</p>
<p>that look awfully a lot like humans.</p>
<p>Well, at least they&rsquo;re not going to be those crypto bots</p>
<p>that seem to populate my comment section</p>
<p>when I post anything on Instagram.</p>
<p>I actually delete those</p>
<p>even though they add to the comment roster.</p>
<p>And, you know, they bother me so much.</p>
<p>I spend, you know, at least 10, 15 minutes on each post</p>
<p>just deleting those.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what they need to do,</p>
<p>but I&rsquo;m not interested in whatever it is they&rsquo;re offering.</p>
<p>Speaking of non-bots,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to assume that all the questions</p>
<p>are not from bots.</p>
<p>There are a lot of questions here,</p>
<p>more than 10,000 questions, goodness.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just take a few working from top to bottom.</p>
<p>What ideas have you been wrestling with lately?</p>
<p>And I think about the company as one,</p>
<p>but as I scroll to the next, what are some others?</p>
<p>Well, some of the things we&rsquo;ve talked about,</p>
<p>which is,</p>
<p>the ideas of how to understand what is true,</p>
<p>what is true about a human being,</p>
<p>how to reveal that, how to reveal that to a conversation,</p>
<p>how to challenge that properly,</p>
<p>that it leads to understanding, not derision.</p>
<p>So that applies to everybody</p>
<p>from Donald Trump to Vladimir Putin.</p>
<p>Also, another idea is there&rsquo;s a deep distrust of science</p>
<p>and trying to understand, the growing distrust of science,</p>
<p>trying to understand what&rsquo;s the role of those of us</p>
<p>that have a foot in the scientific community,</p>
<p>how to be, how to regain some of that trust.</p>
<p>Also, there&rsquo;s, as we talked about,</p>
<p>how to find and how to maintain a good relationship.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s really been,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never felt quite as lonely</p>
<p>as I have this year with Ukraine.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like so many times I would just lay there</p>
<p>and just feeling so deeply alone,</p>
<p>because I felt that my home,</p>
<p>not my home, like literally,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m an American, I love,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a proud American, I&rsquo;ll die an American,</p>
<p>but my home in the sense of my generationally,</p>
<p>my family&rsquo;s home is now going,</p>
<p>is now, has been changed forever.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no more being proud of being</p>
<p>from the former Russia or Ukraine.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s now a political message to say,</p>
<p>if you, to show your pride.</p>
<p>And so it&rsquo;s been extremely lonely.</p>
<p>And within that world,</p>
<p>with all the things I&rsquo;m pursuing,</p>
<p>how do you find a successful relationship?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s been tough.</p>
<p>But obviously, and there&rsquo;s a huge number of technical ideas</p>
<p>with the startup of like,</p>
<p>how the hell do you make this thing work?</p>
<p>Well, the relationship topic</p>
<p>is one we talked a little bit about.</p>
<p>And last time we touched on a little bit more detail.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna come back to that.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve made a note here.</p>
<p>What or who inspired Lex, you,</p>
<p>to wear a suit every time you podcast?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good question.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know the answer to that.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s two answers to that question.</p>
<p>One is a suit, and two is a black suit and black tie.</p>
<p>Because I used to do, I used to have more variety,</p>
<p>which is like, it was always a black suit,</p>
<p>but I would sometimes do a red tie and a blue tie.</p>
<p>But that was mostly me trying to fit into society</p>
<p>because like varieties,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re supposed to have some variety.</p>
<p>What inspired me is, at first,</p>
<p>was a general culture that doesn&rsquo;t take itself seriously</p>
<p>in terms of how you present yourself to the world.</p>
<p>So in academia, in the tech world, just at Google,</p>
<p>everybody was wearing like pajamas and like very relaxed.</p>
<p>In the tech, I don&rsquo;t know how it is in the science,</p>
<p>in the like chemistry, biology, and so on.</p>
<p>But in computer science, everybody was like very,</p>
<p>I mean, very relaxed in terms of the stuff they wear.</p>
<p>So I wanted to try to really take myself seriously</p>
<p>and take every single moment serious</p>
<p>and everything I do seriously.</p>
<p>And the suit made me feel that way.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how it looks, but it made me feel that way.</p>
<p>And I think in terms of people I look up to,</p>
<p>that wore a suit that made me think of that</p>
<p>is probably Richard Feynman.</p>
<p>I see him-</p>
<p>Such a wonderful human being.</p>
<p>Yes, I see him as like the epitome of class</p>
<p>and humor and brilliance.</p>
<p>And obviously I can never come close to that kind of,</p>
<p>be able to simply explain really complicated ideas</p>
<p>and to have humor.</p>
<p>And wit, but definitely aspire to that.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s just the, you know,</p>
<p>Mad Men, that whole era of the 50s,</p>
<p>the classiness of that.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something about a suit</p>
<p>that both removes the importance of fashion</p>
<p>from the character.</p>
<p>You see the person.</p>
<p>I think not to, I forgot who said this,</p>
<p>maybe like Coco Chanel or somebody like this,</p>
<p>is that, you know, you wear a shabby dress</p>
<p>and everyone sees the dress.</p>
<p>You wear a beautiful dress and everybody sees the woman.</p>
<p>So in that sense, I was,</p>
<p>hopefully I&rsquo;m quoting that correctly, but-</p>
<p>Sounds good.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a sense in which a simple, classy suit</p>
<p>allows people to focus on your character.</p>
<p>And then do so like with the full responsibility of that.</p>
<p>Like this is who I am.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I love that.</p>
<p>And I love what you said just prior to that.</p>
<p>You know, my father, who again,</p>
<p>is always asking me why I don&rsquo;t dress formally like you do.</p>
<p>Always said to me growing up, if you overdress slightly,</p>
<p>at least people know that you took them seriously.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a sign of respect for your audience too,</p>
<p>in my eyes.</p>
<p>Someone asked, is there an AI equivalent of psychedelics?</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m assuming they mean,</p>
<p>is there something that machines can do for themselves</p>
<p>in order to alter their neural circuitry</p>
<p>through unconventional activation patterns?</p>
<p>Yes, obviously.</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t know exactly how psychedelics work,</p>
<p>but you can see that with all the diffusion models now,</p>
<p>with DALI and stable diffusion</p>
<p>that generates from text art.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s basically a small injection of noise</p>
<p>into a system that has a deep representation</p>
<p>of visual information.</p>
<p>So it was able to convert text to art</p>
<p>in introducing uncertainty into that, noise into that.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s kind of maybe,</p>
<p>I could see that as a parallel to psychedelics</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s able to create some incredible things</p>
<p>from a conceptual understanding of a thing.</p>
<p>It can create incredible art that no human, I think,</p>
<p>could have at least easily created</p>
<p>through a bit of introduction of randomness.</p>
<p>Randomness does a lot of work</p>
<p>in the machine learning world, just enough.</p>
<p>There are a lot of requests of you for relationship,</p>
<p>a lot of requests about statistics about you,</p>
<p>data about you specifically.</p>
<p>Flipping past those,</p>
<p>what was the hardest belt to achieve in jujitsu?</p>
<p>I would have assumed the black belt,</p>
<p>but is that actually true?</p>
<p>No, I mean, everybody has a different journey through jujitsu</p>
<p>as people know.</p>
<p>For me, the black belt was the ceremonial belt,</p>
<p>which is not usually the case because I fought the wars.</p>
<p>Like I trained twice a day for, I don&rsquo;t know how many years,</p>
<p>seven, eight years.</p>
<p>I competed nonstop.</p>
<p>I competed against people much better than me.</p>
<p>I competed against many</p>
<p>and beaten many black belts and brown belts.</p>
<p>I think for me personally,</p>
<p>the hardest belt was the brown belt</p>
<p>because for people who know jujitsu,</p>
<p>the size of tournament divisions</p>
<p>for blue belts and purple belts is just humongous.</p>
<p>Like worlds, when I competed at worlds,</p>
<p>it was like 140 people in a division,</p>
<p>which means you have to win, I forget how many times,</p>
<p>but seven, eight, nine times in a row to medal.</p>
<p>And so I just had to put in a lot of work during that time.</p>
<p>And especially for competitors,</p>
<p>instructors usually really make you earn a belt.</p>
<p>So to earn the purple belt was extremely difficult,</p>
<p>extremely difficult.</p>
<p>And then to earn the brown belt means I had to compete</p>
<p>nonstop against other purple belts, which are young.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re talking about like the people that usually compete</p>
<p>are like 23, 24, 25 year olds.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re like shredded, incredible cardio.</p>
<p>They can, for some reason,</p>
<p>are in their life worth it.</p>
<p>No kids, nothing.</p>
<p>They can dedicate everything to this pursuit.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re training two, three, four times a day.</p>
<p>Diet is on point.</p>
<p>And for me, because they&rsquo;re usually bigger</p>
<p>and taller than me and just more aggressive,</p>
<p>actual good athletes.</p>
<p>Yeah, I had to go through a lot of wars</p>
<p>to earn that brown belt.</p>
<p>But then-</p>
<p>I had to try this jujitsu thing.</p>
<p>Yeah, you should.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s a different-</p>
<p>Well, I tried, I did the one class,</p>
<p>but I really want to embrace it.</p>
<p>As you know, many pursuits like jiu-jitsu are different.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re doing your 20s and 30s and later,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s a different,</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t, you&rsquo;re not,</p>
<p>you can have a bit of an ego in your 20s.</p>
<p>You can have that fire under you,</p>
<p>but you should be sort of more Zen-like</p>
<p>and wise and patient later in life.</p>
<p>Well, one would hope.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the wisdom.</p>
<p>Well, I think Rogan is still a meathead.</p>
<p>He still goes hard and crazy</p>
<p>and he&rsquo;s still super competitive on that.</p>
<p>So some people can, Jocko is somebody like that.</p>
<p>Well, whatever they&rsquo;re doing,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re doing something right because they&rsquo;re still in it.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s super impressive.</p>
<p>There were far too many questions to ask all of them,</p>
<p>but several, if not many,</p>
<p>asked a highly appropriate question</p>
<p>for where we are in the arc of this discussion.</p>
<p>And this is one, admittedly,</p>
<p>that you ask in your podcasts all the time,</p>
<p>but I get the great pleasure</p>
<p>of being in the question-asker seat today.</p>
<p>And so what is your advice to young people?</p>
<p>So I just gave a lecture at MIT</p>
<p>and the amount of love I got there is incredible.</p>
<p>And so of course, who you&rsquo;re talking to</p>
<p>is usually undergrads, maybe young graduate students.</p>
<p>And so one person did ask for advice</p>
<p>as a question at the end, I did a bunch of Q&amp;A.</p>
<p>So my answer was that the world will tell you</p>
<p>to find a work-life balance,</p>
<p>to sort of explore,</p>
<p>to try different fields</p>
<p>to see what you really connect with,</p>
<p>variety, general education, all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>And I said, in your 20s,</p>
<p>I think you should find one thing you&rsquo;re passionate about</p>
<p>and work harder at that</p>
<p>than you worked at anything else in your life.</p>
<p>And if it destroys you, it destroys you.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s advice for in your 20s.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how universally true that advice is,</p>
<p>but I think at least give that a chance,</p>
<p>like sacrifice, real sacrifice</p>
<p>towards a thing you really care about</p>
<p>and work your ass off.</p>
<p>That said, I&rsquo;ve met so many people</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m starting to think that advice is best applied</p>
<p>or best tried in the engineering disciplines,</p>
<p>especially programming.</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s a bunch of disciplines</p>
<p>in which you can achieve success with much fewer hours</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s much more important to actually have</p>
<p>a clarity of thinking and great ideas</p>
<p>and have an energetic mind.</p>
<p>Like the grind in certain disciplines</p>
<p>does not produce great work.</p>
<p>I just know that in computer science and programming,</p>
<p>some of the best people ever that have built system,</p>
<p>have programmed systems,</p>
<p>are usually like the John Carmack kind of people</p>
<p>that drink soda, eat pizza and program 18 hours a day.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know, actually,</p>
<p>you have to, I think, really go discipline specific.</p>
<p>So my advice applies to my own life,</p>
<p>which has been mostly spent behind the computer.</p>
<p>And for that, you really, really have to put in the hours.</p>
<p>And what that means is essentially</p>
<p>if you feel like a grind,</p>
<p>I do recommend that you should at least try it in your own.</p>
<p>That if you interview</p>
<p>some of the most accomplished people ever,</p>
<p>I think if they&rsquo;re honest with you,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re gonna talk about their 20s</p>
<p>as a journey of a lot of pain</p>
<p>and a lot of really hard work.</p>
<p>I think what really happens, unfortunately,</p>
<p>is a lot of those successful people later in life</p>
<p>will talk about work-life balance.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll say, you know what I learned from that process</p>
<p>is that it&rsquo;s really important</p>
<p>to get sun in the morning, to have health,</p>
<p>to have good relationships and friends.</p>
<p>Hire a chef.</p>
<p>Yes, exactly.</p>
<p>But I think those people have forgotten</p>
<p>the value of the journey they took to that lesson.</p>
<p>I think work-life balance is best learned the hard way.</p>
<p>My own perspective,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s certain things you can only learn the hard way.</p>
<p>And so you should learn that the hard way.</p>
<p>Yeah, so that&rsquo;s definitely advice.</p>
<p>And I should say that I admire people that work hard.</p>
<p>If you wanna get on my good side,</p>
<p>I think are the people that give everything they got</p>
<p>towards something.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t actually matter what it is,</p>
<p>but towards achieving excellence in a thing,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the highest thing that we can reach</p>
<p>for as human beings, I think,</p>
<p>is excellence at a thing.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>Well, speaking of excellence at a thing,</p>
<p>whether or not it&rsquo;s teaching at MIT or the podcast</p>
<p>or the company that resides in the near future</p>
<p>that you create,</p>
<p>once again, I&rsquo;m speaking for an enormous number of people</p>
<p>that excellence and hard work certainly</p>
<p>are woven through everything that you do.</p>
<p>Every time I sit down with you,</p>
<p>I begin and finish with such an immense feeling of joy</p>
<p>and appreciation and gratitude.</p>
<p>And it wouldn&rsquo;t be a Lex Friedman podcast</p>
<p>or in case of a Lex Friedman being a guest on a podcast,</p>
<p>if the word love weren&rsquo;t mentioned at least 10 times.</p>
<p>So the feelings of gratitude for all the work you do,</p>
<p>for taking the time here today to share with us</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re doing, your thoughts, your insights,</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re perplexed about</p>
<p>and what drives you and your callings.</p>
<p>Can I read a poem?</p>
<p>Yes, please.</p>
<p>He was trying to cut me off,</p>
<p>but that was getting a little long.</p>
<p>No, no, no, no.</p>
<p>This is, I was thinking about this recently.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of my favorite Robert Frost poems.</p>
<p>And I, because I wrote several essays on it as you do,</p>
<p>because I think it&rsquo;s a popular one that&rsquo;s read.</p>
<p>And so essays being like trying to interpret poetry</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s one that sticks with me.</p>
<p>I mean, both it&rsquo;s calm beauty,</p>
<p>but in the seriousness of what it means,</p>
<p>because I ultimately think it&rsquo;s the,</p>
<p>so stopping by a woods on a snowy evening.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s ultimately a human being,</p>
<p>a man asking the old Sisyphus,</p>
<p>the old Camus question of why live.</p>
<p>I think this poem, even though it doesn&rsquo;t seem like it,</p>
<p>is a question of a man contending with suicide</p>
<p>and choosing to live.</p>
<p>Whose woods these are, I think I know.</p>
<p>His house is in the village though.</p>
<p>He will not see me stopping here</p>
<p>to watch his woods fill up with snow.</p>
<p>My little horse must think it queer</p>
<p>to stop without a farmhouse near</p>
<p>between the woods and frozen lake,</p>
<p>the darkest evening of the year.</p>
<p>He gives his harness bells a shake</p>
<p>to ask if there&rsquo;s some mistake.</p>
<p>The only other sounds the sweep</p>
<p>of easy wind and downy flake.</p>
<p>The woods are lovely, dark and deep,</p>
<p>but I have promises to keep</p>
<p>and miles to go before I sleep</p>
<p>and miles to go before I sleep.</p>
<p>The woods representing the darkness,</p>
<p>the comfort of the woods representing death.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s a man choosing to live.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think about that often,</p>
<p>especially in my dark, dark moments.</p>
<p>You have promises to keep.</p>
<p>Thank you for having me, Andrew,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re a beautiful human being.</p>

<p>During today&rsquo;s episode, we did not discuss supplements,</p>
<p>but on many previous episodes of the Huberman Lab podcast,</p>
<p>we do discuss supplements,</p>
<p>because while supplements aren&rsquo;t necessary for everybody,</p>
<p>many people derive tremendous benefit from them</p>
<p>for things like enhancing sleep and focus</p>
<p>and hormone augmentation and so forth.</p>
<p>The Huberman Lab podcast has partnered</p>
<p>with Momentus Supplements</p>
<p>because they are of the very highest quality</p>
<p>and they ship internationally.</p>
<p>In addition to that,</p>
<p>they have single ingredient formulations</p>
<p>that allow you to devise the supplement regimen</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s most effective and most cost-effective for you.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to see the supplements discussed</p>
<p>on the Huberman Lab podcast,</p>
<p>please go to livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>If you haven&rsquo;t already signed up</p>
<p>for the Huberman Lab podcast&rsquo;s</p>
<p>zero-cost neural network newsletter,</p>
<p>we invite you to do so.</p>
