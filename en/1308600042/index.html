    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,</p>
<p>where we discuss science</p>
<p>and science-based tools for everyday life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Andrew Huberman,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology</p>
<p>at Stanford School of Medicine.</p>
<p>Today, we&rsquo;re talking all about fasting.</p>
<p>And anytime we&rsquo;re talking about fasting,</p>
<p>we are also talking about eating</p>
<p>because we all need to eat sooner or later.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to talk about how fasting</p>
<p>and when we eat influences a large range of aspects</p>
<p>of our health and wellbeing, both physical and mental.</p>
<p>So while nowadays,</p>
<p>most people are familiar with the term intermittent fasting,</p>
<p>also sometimes called time-restricted feeding,</p>
<p>I think most people don&rsquo;t really understand</p>
<p>how that process works.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sort of obvious that intermittent fasting,</p>
<p>aka time-restricted feeding,</p>
<p>involves eating at certain periods of each 24-hour cycle,</p>
<p>or maybe even not eating for entire days in some cases.</p>
<p>But if you think about it, everybody sleeps eventually,</p>
<p>and therefore, because people don&rsquo;t eat during their sleep,</p>
<p>almost everybody is employing some form</p>
<p>of intermittent fasting or time-restricted feeding.</p>
<p>What we&rsquo;re going to talk about today</p>
<p>is how particular schedules of time-restricted feeding</p>
<p>can impact our health in different ways.</p>
<p>And when I say different ways,</p>
<p>I mean, we&rsquo;re going to talk about</p>
<p>how intermittent fasting, aka time-restricted feeding,</p>
<p>impacts weight loss, fat loss in particular,</p>
<p>muscle maintenance and loss and gain,</p>
<p>organ health, such as gut health and liver health,</p>
<p>the genome, the epigenome, inflammation,</p>
<p>sickness, recovery, and healing from sickness,</p>
<p>exercise, cognition, mood, and lifespan.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;re going to cover a tremendous amount of information.</p>
<p>I promise to make it all directly accessible,</p>
<p>regardless of whether or not you have a background</p>
<p>in biology and metabolic science or not.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also going to talk about a lot of tools.</p>
<p>In fact, I&rsquo;m going to discuss a number of tools</p>
<p>during today&rsquo;s episode that actually make it such</p>
<p>that you don&rsquo;t have to follow any feeding schedule</p>
<p>or fasting schedule, same thing, if you think about it,</p>
<p>in any absolutely strict regimented way,</p>
<p>meaning if you were to only eat during an eight hour</p>
<p>period of each day, most of the time,</p>
<p>but then occasionally eat across a 12 hour period</p>
<p>of the day, in theory, that could actually have</p>
<p>pretty serious detrimental health effects.</p>
<p>And yet there are things that you can do</p>
<p>to attenuate those negative effects.</p>
<p>In fact, there are things that you can do and or take</p>
<p>that can make it as if you did not eat at all.</p>
<p>And so we&rsquo;ll discuss what those tools are.</p>
<p>And in many cases, for sake of health, weight loss</p>
<p>and performance, making the body think that it did not eat</p>
<p>at all can actually be quite beneficial.</p>
<p>Today, we&rsquo;re going to cover mechanism</p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re going to cover tools.</p>
<p>Before we do that, I want to highlight a particular result</p>
<p>that was published recently because it serves</p>
<p>as a useful backbone as we wade into the conversation</p>
<p>about fasting.</p>
<p>This is a study that was published</p>
<p>in the journal Cell Metabolism, a cell press journal,</p>
<p>excellent journal.</p>
<p>And the title of the paper is fasting blood glucose</p>
<p>as a predictor of mortality, lost in translation.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll explain what the lost in translation part means</p>
<p>in a moment.</p>
<p>But the basic takeaway of this study,</p>
<p>and I should mention that the first author of the study</p>
<p>is Paliyaguru, P-A-L-I-Y-A-G-U-R-U, guru,</p>
<p>Paliyaguru et al.</p>
<p>The basic finding of the study is that in humans,</p>
<p>higher blood glucose is associated with mortality.</p>
<p>And in fact, if you look at blood glucose,</p>
<p>resting blood glucose across the lifespan,</p>
<p>what you find is as people age,</p>
<p>resting blood glucose goes up.</p>
<p>Now this is very interesting because for a long time,</p>
<p>it was thought that metabolism actually goes down</p>
<p>as we age.</p>
<p>And to some extent that&rsquo;s true,</p>
<p>but the reductions in metabolism are not nearly as robust</p>
<p>as we once thought that they were across the lifespan.</p>
<p>However, unless there&rsquo;s something done to mitigate</p>
<p>the increase in blood glucose associated with the aging,</p>
<p>almost everybody experiences a gradual,</p>
<p>but regular increase in resting blood glucose</p>
<p>that predicts mortality.</p>
<p>Now, the title, as I mentioned,</p>
<p>is fasting blood glucose as a predictor of mortality,</p>
<p>lost in translation.</p>
<p>And the reason that they included lost in translation</p>
<p>in the title is that what I just told you</p>
<p>that increases in resting blood glucose predict mortality</p>
<p>or are correlated with mortality is true for human beings</p>
<p>and for non-human primates, monkeys,</p>
<p>but the opposite is true in mice.</p>
<p>And so I thought it was important to use this study</p>
<p>as an example of where studies in mice often,</p>
<p>but not always translate to humans and to non-human primates.</p>
<p>So today I&rsquo;m going to be careful to distinguish</p>
<p>when a study was performed in mice versus in humans,</p>
<p>because it seems that at least when discussing</p>
<p>feeding blood glucose and other aspects of diet,</p>
<p>as they relate to health and wellbeing,</p>
<p>whether or not a study was performed in rodents</p>
<p>or in humans can be very important.</p>
<p>In this case,</p>
<p>the results were directly 180 degrees</p>
<p>opposite to one another.</p>
<p>In other words, in mice,</p>
<p>resting blood glucose went down</p>
<p>and it was associated with mortality.</p>
<p>So lower blood glucose associated with mortality,</p>
<p>whereas in humans,</p>
<p>higher resting blood glucose was associated with mortality.</p>
<p>And obviously what we&rsquo;re mostly interested in</p>
<p>is health and wellbeing of ourselves, of humans.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure there are some people out there</p>
<p>that are intensely concerned about the health</p>
<p>and wellbeing of mice,</p>
<p>which you could imagine a few rare contexts</p>
<p>where that&rsquo;s important,</p>
<p>but obviously most of us are interested in human health.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll be sure to emphasize when studies were performed</p>
<p>in humans versus in mice.</p>
<p>Before we begin,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to emphasize that this podcast is separate</p>
<p>from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.</p>
<p>It is however,</p>
<p>part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost</p>
<p>to consumer information about science</p>
<p>and science related tools to the general public.</p>
<p>In keeping with that theme,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank the sponsors of today&rsquo;s podcast.</p>
<p>Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens.</p>
<p>Athletic Greens is an all-in-one</p>
<p>vitamin mineral probiotic drink.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been taking Athletic Greens since 2012.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m delighted that they&rsquo;re sponsoring the podcast.</p>
<p>The reason I started taking Athletic Greens</p>
<p>and the reason I still take Athletic Greens</p>
<p>once or twice a day</p>
<p>is that it helps me cover all of my basic nutritional needs.</p>
<p>It makes up for any deficiencies that I might have.</p>
<p>In addition, it has probiotics,</p>
<p>which are vital for microbiome health.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done a couple of episodes now</p>
<p>on the so-called gut microbiome</p>
<p>and the ways in which the microbiome interacts</p>
<p>with your immune system, with your brain to regulate mood,</p>
<p>and essentially with every biological system</p>
<p>relevant to health throughout your brain and body.</p>
<p>With Athletic Greens, I get the vitamins I need,</p>
<p>the minerals I need,</p>
<p>and the probiotics to support my microbiome.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Athletic Greens,</p>
<p>you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>and claim a special offer.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll give you five free travel packs</p>
<p>plus a year supply of vitamin D3 K2.</p>
<p>There are a ton of data now showing that vitamin D3</p>
<p>is essential for various aspects of our brain</p>
<p>and body health.</p>
<p>Even if we&rsquo;re getting a lot of sunshine,</p>
<p>many of us are still deficient in vitamin D3.</p>
<p>And K2 is also important</p>
<p>because it regulates things like cardiovascular function,</p>
<p>calcium in the body, and so on.</p>
<p>Again, go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman</p>
<p>to claim the special offer of the five free travel packs</p>
<p>and the year supply of vitamin D3 K2.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Element.</p>
<p>Element is an electrolyte drink</p>
<p>that has everything you need and nothing you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>That means the exact ratios of electrolytes are an element,</p>
<p>and those are sodium, magnesium, and potassium,</p>
<p>but it has no sugar.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked many times before on this podcast</p>
<p>about the key role of hydration and electrolytes</p>
<p>for nerve cell function, neuron function,</p>
<p>as well as the function of all the cells</p>
<p>and all the tissues and organ systems of the body.</p>
<p>If we have sodium, magnesium, and potassium</p>
<p>present in the proper ratios,</p>
<p>all of those cells function properly</p>
<p>and all our bodily systems can be optimized.</p>
<p>If the electrolytes are not present</p>
<p>and if hydration is low,</p>
<p>we simply can&rsquo;t think as well as we would otherwise,</p>
<p>our mood is off, hormone systems go off,</p>
<p>our ability to get into physical action,</p>
<p>to engage in endurance and strength</p>
<p>and all sorts of other things is diminished.</p>
<p>So with Element, you can make sure</p>
<p>that you&rsquo;re staying on top of your hydration</p>
<p>and that you&rsquo;re getting the proper ratios of electrolytes.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to try Element,</p>
<p>you can go to drinkelement, that&rsquo;s lmnt.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ll get a free Element sample pack</p>
<p>with your purchase.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re all delicious.</p>
<p>So again, if you want to try Element,</p>
<p>you can go to elementlmnt.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s episode is also brought to us by Thesis.</p>
<p>Thesis makes what are called nootropics,</p>
<p>which means smart drugs.</p>
<p>Now, to be honest, I am not a fan of the term nootropics.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe in smart drugs in the sense that,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe that there&rsquo;s any one substance</p>
<p>or collection of substances that can make us smarter.</p>
<p>I do believe based on science, however,</p>
<p>that there are particular neural circuits</p>
<p>and brain functions that allow us to be more focused,</p>
<p>more alert, access creativity, be more motivated, et cetera.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just the way that the brain works.</p>
<p>Different neural circuits for different brain states.</p>
<p>Thesis understands this.</p>
<p>And as far as I know, they&rsquo;re the first nootropics company</p>
<p>to create targeted nootropics for specific outcomes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Thesis for more than six months now,</p>
<p>and I can confidently say that their nootropics</p>
<p>have been a total game changer.</p>
<p>My go-to formula is the clarity formula,</p>
<p>or sometimes I&rsquo;ll use their energy formula before training.</p>
<p>To get your own personalized nootropic starter kit,</p>
<p>go online to takethesis.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>take a three-minute quiz,</p>
<p>and Thesis will send you four different formulas</p>
<p>to try in your first month.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s takethesis.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>and use the code Huberman at checkout</p>
<p>for 10% off your first order.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pleased to announce that the Huberman Lab Podcast</p>
<p>has now partnered with Momentus Supplements.</p>
<p>We partnered with Momentus for several important reasons.</p>
<p>First of all, they ship internationally,</p>
<p>because we know that many of you are located</p>
<p>outside of the United States.</p>
<p>Second of all, and perhaps most important,</p>
<p>the quality of their supplements is second to none,</p>
<p>both in terms of purity and precision</p>
<p>of the amounts of the ingredients.</p>
<p>Third, we&rsquo;ve really emphasized supplements</p>
<p>that are single ingredient supplements,</p>
<p>and that are supplied in dosages</p>
<p>that allow you to build a supplementation protocol</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for cost,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s optimized for effectiveness,</p>
<p>and that you can add things</p>
<p>and remove things from your protocol</p>
<p>in a way that&rsquo;s really systematic and scientific.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to see the supplements</p>
<p>that we partner with Momentus on,</p>
<p>you can go to livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>There you&rsquo;ll see those supplements,</p>
<p>and just keep in mind that we are constantly expanding</p>
<p>the library of supplements available through Momentus</p>
<p>on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s livemomentus.com slash Huberman.</p>
<p>Okay, so let&rsquo;s talk about feeding,</p>
<p>fasting, health, and performance.</p>
<p>And I want to just establish a few foundational terms</p>
<p>so that we&rsquo;re all on the same page.</p>
<p>First of all, rather than talk about fasting</p>
<p>or time-restricted feeding,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m largely going to talk about time-restricted feeding,</p>
<p>but please understand that time-restricted feeding</p>
<p>is just one side of the coin that is a two-sided coin</p>
<p>that includes fasting on the one hand, not eating,</p>
<p>and time-restricted feeding on the other hand.</p>
<p>I may occasionally say fasting,</p>
<p>but because fasting and eating</p>
<p>establish different biological conditions in the body,</p>
<p>time-restricted feeding is the term that I will use</p>
<p>to describe the overall plan</p>
<p>of restricting one&rsquo;s eating window, as it&rsquo;s called,</p>
<p>to a particular phase of each 24-hour day,</p>
<p>or in some cases, to particular days within the week,</p>
<p>because as you&rsquo;ll soon learn,</p>
<p>there are aspects of time-restricted feeding, aka fasting,</p>
<p>that involve eating every other day</p>
<p>or eating one way for five days</p>
<p>and then fasting for two days and so forth.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll be very precise about what I mean and why I mean it,</p>
<p>but for the time being,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to refer to time-restricted feeding</p>
<p>as a way to put an umbrella over this conversation.</p>
<p>Second of all,</p>
<p>I am going to emphasize a lot of biological mechanism.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve listened to this podcast before,</p>
<p>you know that I always begin with biological mechanism.</p>
<p>I do describe tools of how to implement those mechanisms,</p>
<p>but I wholeheartedly believe that knowing mechanisms</p>
<p>and understanding how these processes work</p>
<p>gives you tremendous flexibility and understanding</p>
<p>and control over the processes</p>
<p>of your mental and physical health.</p>
<p>Whereas if I were to just list off a menu of things to do</p>
<p>and not to do, those will work,</p>
<p>but those will not give you the kind of understanding</p>
<p>that would allow you to navigate through life,</p>
<p>through travel, through dinners out,</p>
<p>through different exercise schedules,</p>
<p>whether or not you&rsquo;re one age or another age,</p>
<p>male, female, et cetera.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m giving you mechanisms so that you can gain more control</p>
<p>over the systems in your brain and body.</p>
<p>Everything&rsquo;s timestamped,</p>
<p>so if you want to jump to the to-dos,</p>
<p>you can certainly do that,</p>
<p>but I encourage you to hang in there for the mechanism bit.</p>
<p>I will make it all very clear</p>
<p>because if you understand mechanism,</p>
<p>you are in a true place of power and control</p>
<p>over your biology.</p>
<p>If ever there was a topic that is controversial,</p>
<p>especially on the internet,</p>
<p>it is that of diet and nutrition.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m wading into this with a smile</p>
<p>and in eager anticipation of all the,</p>
<p>but, but, but this, and but, but that,</p>
<p>and wait, but this showed that.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the deal.</p>
<p>We need to precisely define what it is</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;re talking about when we talk about nutrition.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to give you an example of a study</p>
<p>that was published a few years ago, 2018,</p>
<p>by a colleague of mine at Stanford,</p>
<p>Chris Gardner is a terrific professor of nutrition</p>
<p>and has done a lot of important studies</p>
<p>on how nutrition impacts different aspects of health.</p>
<p>This is a large-scale study.</p>
<p>It was published in JAMA,</p>
<p>the Journal of the American Medical Association,</p>
<p>one of the very top tier journals in the area of medicine.</p>
<p>And certainly for a paper on nutrition to show up there</p>
<p>meant that it had to meet an exceedingly high standard.</p>
<p>This paper where Chris is the first author,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s Gardner et al, 2018, JAMA,</p>
<p>looked at weight loss in people following</p>
<p>one particular diet versus another particular diet.</p>
<p>And this was a 12 month weight loss study.</p>
<p>So it was focused specifically on weight loss,</p>
<p>although they looked at some other parameters as well.</p>
<p>And the basic conclusion of the study</p>
<p>was that there was no significant difference</p>
<p>in weight change between people following</p>
<p>a healthy low-fat diet</p>
<p>versus a healthy low-carbohydrate diet</p>
<p>with significantly more dietary fats in them.</p>
<p>This caused a lot of ripples in the world of nutrition</p>
<p>and nutritional science,</p>
<p>and certainly in the general population,</p>
<p>because anyone that understands diet and nutrition</p>
<p>would immediately say, but wait,</p>
<p>there are all sorts of different implications</p>
<p>of eating one type of diet,</p>
<p>say low-carbohydrate, higher fats,</p>
<p>versus a higher-carbohydrate, lower-fat diet.</p>
<p>And indeed there are.</p>
<p>This study was focused specifically on fat loss</p>
<p>and on weight loss.</p>
<p>So as we discuss time-restricted feeding,</p>
<p>we need to be very precise about what are the effects</p>
<p>of time-restricted feeding</p>
<p>and of eating in particular ways at particular times.</p>
<p>We are going to emphasize again,</p>
<p>whether or not the study was done in mice or in humans,</p>
<p>in athletes and men and women or both.</p>
<p>But the study from Gardner and colleagues</p>
<p>is a beautiful study and really emphasizes</p>
<p>that if one&rsquo;s main goal is simply to lose weight,</p>
<p>then it really does not matter what one eats,</p>
<p>provided that the number of calories burned</p>
<p>is higher than the number of calories ingested.</p>
<p>However, anyone out there</p>
<p>who understands a little bit of biology</p>
<p>or a lot of biology will agree</p>
<p>that there are many factors that impact</p>
<p>that calories burned part of the equation.</p>
<p>Some of those are obvious.</p>
<p>So for instance, amount of exercise,</p>
<p>type of exercise, basal metabolic rate,</p>
<p>how much energy one burns just sitting there.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked before on this podcast</p>
<p>about NEAT, non-exercise induced thermogenesis,</p>
<p>where if people bounce around a lot and fidget a lot,</p>
<p>they can burn anywhere from 800 to 2000 calories per day.</p>
<p>So their quote unquote basal metabolic rate</p>
<p>is actually much higher simply because they&rsquo;re fidgeters.</p>
<p>Whereas people who tend to be more stationary</p>
<p>have a lower basal metabolic rate on average.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s great science to support this.</p>
<p>Metabolic factors and hormones are also very important.</p>
<p>Hormones such as thyroid hormone and insulin</p>
<p>and growth hormone and the sex steroid hormones,</p>
<p>testosterone and estrogen,</p>
<p>those levels will also profoundly influence</p>
<p>the calories out, the calories burned component</p>
<p>of the calories in calories out equation.</p>
<p>So if out there on the internet</p>
<p>or in listening to a particular podcast or speaker,</p>
<p>somebody says, this is the ideal diet</p>
<p>or calories in calories out does not matter</p>
<p>or calories in calories out is the only thing that matters.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s very important to understand</p>
<p>that there are some foundational truths</p>
<p>such as calories in calories out,</p>
<p>but that of course hormone factors</p>
<p>and the context in which a given diet regimen</p>
<p>is taking place are exceedingly important.</p>
<p>A good example of this would be puberty.</p>
<p>At that time in life,</p>
<p>sex steroid hormones are changing profoundly in the body</p>
<p>as are growth hormone and other hormones.</p>
<p>And much of caloric intake is directed</p>
<p>towards protein synthesis,</p>
<p>towards the production of muscle and bone</p>
<p>and other tissues of the body.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because of changes in hormones</p>
<p>that we call puberty.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s no way that we can drill into every aspect</p>
<p>of a given feeding plan or feeding schedule</p>
<p>that would allow us to tap into every aspect</p>
<p>of the list that I read out before,</p>
<p>weight loss, fat loss, muscle, organ, genome, epigenome,</p>
<p>inflammation, exercise, cognition, mood, and lifespan.</p>
<p>But today we&rsquo;re going to be very precise</p>
<p>about how time-restricted feeding,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very clear from both animal studies and human studies</p>
<p>can have a very powerful and positive impact</p>
<p>on everything from weight loss and fat loss</p>
<p>to various health parameters.</p>
<p>This is a beautiful literature that&rsquo;s emerged mostly</p>
<p>in the last 10 or 15 years.</p>
<p>And as we march into this literature,</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;ll see is that there actually is a perfect diet</p>
<p>for you on a given day.</p>
<p>And that perfect diet for you on a given day is contextual,</p>
<p>meaning it depends on what you did yesterday</p>
<p>and what you&rsquo;re going to do tomorrow.</p>
<p>So there is a perfect diet for you.</p>
<p>And today I&rsquo;m going to arm you with the mechanisms</p>
<p>and understanding that will allow you to define</p>
<p>what that perfect diet is and will allow you to eat</p>
<p>on a schedule and to eat the things</p>
<p>that are going to best serve your goals.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about eating and what happens when you eat.</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s talk about fasting or not eating</p>
<p>and what happens when you fast.</p>
<p>I did an entire episode on eating and metabolism</p>
<p>and hormones and other factors that impact appetite.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have time to go into all those details now,</p>
<p>although you&rsquo;re welcome to listen to that episode as well.</p>
<p>But we can briefly describe the overall conditions</p>
<p>that are set in the body when we eat and when we don&rsquo;t eat.</p>
<p>The key word here is conditions.</p>
<p>If I can emphasize anything today,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s that what you eat and when you eat it,</p>
<p>set conditions in your body.</p>
<p>And those conditions can be very good for you</p>
<p>or very bad for you, depending on when you eat.</p>
<p>In fact, when you eat is as important as what you eat.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll repeat that.</p>
<p>When you eat is as important as what you eat,</p>
<p>at least as it relates to health parameters,</p>
<p>in particular liver health and mental health.</p>
<p>Some simple rules about eating.</p>
<p>First of all, when you eat, typically your blood glucose,</p>
<p>your blood sugar will go up.</p>
<p>Also insulin levels will go up.</p>
<p>Insulin is a hormone that&rsquo;s involved in mobilizing glucose</p>
<p>from the bloodstream.</p>
<p>How much your glucose and insulin go up</p>
<p>depends on what you eat and how much you eat.</p>
<p>In general, simple sugars, including fructose from fruit,</p>
<p>but also sucrose and glucose and simple sugars</p>
<p>will raise your insulin and blood glucose</p>
<p>more than complex carbohydrates,</p>
<p>things like grains and breads and pastas and so forth.</p>
<p>And grains and breads and pastas and so forth</p>
<p>will raise your blood glucose</p>
<p>more than fibrous carbohydrates like lettuce and broccoli</p>
<p>and things of that sort.</p>
<p>Protein has a somewhat moderate or modest impact</p>
<p>on insulin and glucose.</p>
<p>And fat has the lowest impact</p>
<p>on raising your blood glucose and blood insulin.</p>
<p>So what you eat will impact how steep a rise</p>
<p>in blood glucose and insulin takes place.</p>
<p>And there are a number of factors that are related</p>
<p>to your individual health that will also dictate how steep</p>
<p>and how high that rise in glucose and insulin will be.</p>
<p>For the time being,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m leaving out people who have type one diabetes.</p>
<p>These are people that don&rsquo;t manufacture their own insulin.</p>
<p>And type two diabetes is essentially insulin insensitivity,</p>
<p>lack of sensitivity to insulin,</p>
<p>which leads to high blood glucose.</p>
<p>But when you eat, blood glucose goes up.</p>
<p>And when you don&rsquo;t eat, blood glucose and insulin go down.</p>
<p>The longer it&rsquo;s been since your last meal,</p>
<p>the lower typically your blood glucose and insulin will be.</p>
<p>And the higher things like GLP-1,</p>
<p>glucagon-like peptide one,</p>
<p>glucagon being a hormone that&rsquo;s also secreted</p>
<p>when you are in a fasted state</p>
<p>or a low blood glucose state.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s involved in mobilizing various energy sources</p>
<p>from the body, including fat</p>
<p>through what we call lipolysis,</p>
<p>also using carbohydrates and potentially even using muscle</p>
<p>as a source of energy.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s kind of a fire hose of information</p>
<p>about what happens when you eat and don&rsquo;t eat.</p>
<p>But just think of it this way,</p>
<p>blood sugar and insulin go up when you eat,</p>
<p>they go down when you don&rsquo;t eat</p>
<p>and other hormones go up when you don&rsquo;t eat.</p>
<p>So there are hormones associated with the fasted state</p>
<p>and there are hormones associated with the eating</p>
<p>and having just eaten state.</p>
<p>Now, the most important thing to understand</p>
<p>is that like everything in biology,</p>
<p>this is a process that takes time.</p>
<p>So insulin and glucose go up when we eat</p>
<p>and it takes some period of time for them to go down.</p>
<p>Even if we stop eating,</p>
<p>they will remain up for some period of time</p>
<p>and then go back down.</p>
<p>It takes time.</p>
<p>This is very important</p>
<p>because if you look at the scientific literature</p>
<p>on fasting, on time-restricted feeding,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s absolutely clear that the health benefits,</p>
<p>not just the weight loss benefits,</p>
<p>but that the health benefits from time-restricted feeding</p>
<p>occur because certain conditions are met</p>
<p>in the brain and body for a certain amount of time.</p>
<p>And that gives us an anchor from which</p>
<p>to view what eating is</p>
<p>in terms of how it sets conditions in the body over time.</p>
<p>And if that sounds overly analytic,</p>
<p>I promise you this is the simplest and best way</p>
<p>to think about any eating schedule or any eating plan.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s fair to say that in the field of nutrition,</p>
<p>there are a few landmark studies</p>
<p>that serve as really strong anchors</p>
<p>for building our understanding of what to eat</p>
<p>and what not to eat and when to eat,</p>
<p>depending on our goals.</p>
<p>The Garner study that I mentioned earlier</p>
<p>is one such study in that it says,</p>
<p>if your goal is weight loss,</p>
<p>it really does not matter what foods you consume</p>
<p>provided that you consume a sub-maintenance caloric diet.</p>
<p>However, I want to emphasize again,</p>
<p>that sets aside issues of adherence,</p>
<p>meaning how easy or hard it is to adhere to a given diet.</p>
<p>Some people find it much easier</p>
<p>to follow a high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet.</p>
<p>Some people follow a different diet</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s much easier for them to follow.</p>
<p>And some people are concerned with mental performance</p>
<p>and athletic performance.</p>
<p>So that study doesn&rsquo;t say there&rsquo;s a best diet.</p>
<p>What it says is that what you consume is less important</p>
<p>than the amount of food that you consume,</p>
<p>at least for sake of weight loss,</p>
<p>not necessarily for sake of health.</p>
<p>Now, the study that I&rsquo;m going to refer to next</p>
<p>is what I would consider the second major pillar</p>
<p>of nutritional studies.</p>
<p>This is a truly landmark study that was carried out</p>
<p>by Sachin Panda, who is a professor</p>
<p>at the Salk Institute of Biological Studies in San Diego,</p>
<p>an absolutely phenomenal institution</p>
<p>and an absolutely phenomenal researcher.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve known Sachin for a number of years,</p>
<p>and I want to emphasize that the current literature</p>
<p>on intermittent fasting and time-restricted feeding</p>
<p>can largely be attributed to Sachin</p>
<p>and the work that he&rsquo;s done.</p>
<p>There are others involved too, of course,</p>
<p>time-restricted feeding and fasting has a rich history</p>
<p>that goes back many hundreds, if not thousands of years</p>
<p>in different cultures and religions,</p>
<p>but the science of time-restricted feeding</p>
<p>can really mainly be attributed to the incredible work</p>
<p>that Sachin has done.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m grateful to consider him a friend and a colleague.</p>
<p>And we consulted at length in anticipation of this episode.</p>
<p>I also hope to have him on as a guest in the future.</p>
<p>The landmark paper that came from Sachin&rsquo;s lab</p>
<p>was published in 2012.</p>
<p>This was a paper in mice that set the basis</p>
<p>for studies in humans that came later.</p>
<p>And the title of this paper is</p>
<p>Time-Restricted Feeding Without Reducing Caloric Intake</p>
<p>Prevents Metabolic Diseases in Mice Fed a High-Fat Diet.</p>
<p>So the title tells us a lot.</p>
<p>It says that what&rsquo;s varied in this study</p>
<p>is not what these mice ate, it was when they ate it.</p>
<p>And there were essentially four conditions in this study</p>
<p>and the results are absolutely remarkable.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m going to walk you through the major results.</p>
<p>What they did is they gave mice access</p>
<p>to different types of food.</p>
<p>There were four groups.</p>
<p>One group of mice had access to just a normal mouse diet.</p>
<p>It would not be a diet that you&rsquo;d be very interested in.</p>
<p>I confess I&rsquo;ve actually tasted mouse chow.</p>
<p>If you work with mice at all,</p>
<p>you just have to do it at least once.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t taste very good.</p>
<p>It tastes like a very bland graham cracker cookie.</p>
<p>And I confess that I only had the tiniest little bit,</p>
<p>but mice like that stuff.</p>
<p>And if you allow them to eat that stuff,</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s called ad libitum, whenever they want,</p>
<p>you just keep it in their food 24 hours a day.</p>
<p>They will eat sometimes</p>
<p>and then they won&rsquo;t eat it at other times.</p>
<p>Or in this case, they also had a condition</p>
<p>where they gave them mouse chow in a time restricted way,</p>
<p>just for a certain number of hours each day</p>
<p>of about eight hours.</p>
<p>Or they gave them a high fat diet.</p>
<p>That was a separate group,</p>
<p>got a high fat diet at any time they wanted.</p>
<p>So this was kind of the carnival for mice</p>
<p>because mice really like high fat,</p>
<p>highly palatable foods.</p>
<p>And so they got a lot of goodies</p>
<p>and high fat in their food.</p>
<p>And then there was a fourth group</p>
<p>that had access to the high fat diet</p>
<p>as much as they wanted to eat,</p>
<p>but only during a restricted time period</p>
<p>of each 24 hour cycle.</p>
<p>Now mice are nocturnal, humans are what we call diurnal.</p>
<p>Actually, we&rsquo;re not really diurnal, we&rsquo;re crepuscular,</p>
<p>which means that we&rsquo;re most active in the morning</p>
<p>and in the evening, not so much in the afternoon.</p>
<p>But nonetheless, everything I&rsquo;m going to tell you</p>
<p>is true also for humans.</p>
<p>And we know this now from human studies.</p>
<p>One of the most important things to take away</p>
<p>from the study was that mice that ate a highly palatable,</p>
<p>high fat diet, a great tasting diet,</p>
<p>but only during a restricted feeding window</p>
<p>of each 24 hour cycle,</p>
<p>maintained or lost weight over time.</p>
<p>Whereas mice that ingested the same diet,</p>
<p>same amount of calories,</p>
<p>but had access to those calories around the clock,</p>
<p>gained weight, became obese and quite sick.</p>
<p>And as an additional second point,</p>
<p>the mice that restricted their feeding window</p>
<p>to a particular portion of eight hours</p>
<p>of every 24 hour cycle,</p>
<p>actually showed some improvement</p>
<p>in important health markers.</p>
<p>And what was even more incredible is that mice</p>
<p>that only ate during a particular feeding window</p>
<p>also experienced some reversal</p>
<p>of some prior negative health effects.</p>
<p>So this study really lit up the world</p>
<p>and got people excited about time-restricted eating.</p>
<p>Again, they used an eight hour feeding window.</p>
<p>The story around that eight hour feeding window</p>
<p>is kind of interesting though.</p>
<p>Not many people know this</p>
<p>because it wasn&rsquo;t included in the paper</p>
<p>and there was no reason to include it in the paper,</p>
<p>not to out anybody,</p>
<p>but it turns out that the reason they used</p>
<p>an eight hour feeding window</p>
<p>and not a nine hour or a 10 hour feeding window</p>
<p>is because studies of this sort</p>
<p>are actually quite demanding to perform</p>
<p>and require the constant presence</p>
<p>of the graduate student or postdoc there</p>
<p>to ensure that the food is in the cages at particular times</p>
<p>and not in the cages at other times.</p>
<p>And mice are really good at hiding food.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll even hide food in their jowls.</p>
<p>And so there&rsquo;s a lot of work that has to be done</p>
<p>to prepare for that eight hour feeding window</p>
<p>and to make sure after that eight hour feeding window,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s all the food has been removed from the cage</p>
<p>and from the jowls of the mice and so forth.</p>
<p>And it turns out that the significant other</p>
<p>of the graduate student and or postdoc,</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t reveal who they were running this study,</p>
<p>forbid their significant other, the scientist,</p>
<p>from being in the lab for periods of time</p>
<p>that were much longer than the 10 or 12 hours</p>
<p>that were required in order to ensure</p>
<p>this eight hour feeding window.</p>
<p>So when we hear the eight hour feeding windows are holy,</p>
<p>they are not holy.</p>
<p>And later we are going to talk about how eating</p>
<p>for a time that&rsquo;s restricted to eight hours</p>
<p>versus 10 hours versus 12 hours, for instance,</p>
<p>how that impacts various parameters like health parameters</p>
<p>and weight loss, et cetera.</p>
<p>But the eight hour feeding window was actually created</p>
<p>because of a real world constraint on the research</p>
<p>and the relationship of the researcher</p>
<p>performing the research,</p>
<p>not because there&rsquo;s anything holy</p>
<p>about an eight hour feeding window.</p>
<p>Now, an important point about when the feeding window falls</p>
<p>within the 24 hour cycle,</p>
<p>it is very important that the feeding window fall</p>
<p>during the more active phase of one&rsquo;s day.</p>
<p>So for humans, that&rsquo;s typically in the early part of the day</p>
<p>or the later part of the day, but not at night.</p>
<p>Put very simply, there are a lot of data now</p>
<p>pointing to the fact that eating during the nocturnal phase</p>
<p>of the 24 hour cycle is very detrimental to one&rsquo;s health.</p>
<p>In fact, when we eat can either enhance our health</p>
<p>or can diminish our health.</p>
<p>When we see light can enhance our feelings of wellbeing</p>
<p>or can diminish our feelings of wellbeing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked many times before about this</p>
<p>on the Huberman Lab Podcast that during the daytime,</p>
<p>you want to get as much sunlight</p>
<p>and other types of bright light in your eyes</p>
<p>as is safely possible.</p>
<p>And then you want to avoid light in the middle of the night.</p>
<p>It has detrimental dopamine lowering effects,</p>
<p>can cause depression, cortisol increases, et cetera.</p>
<p>So when you view light is as important</p>
<p>as the light that you view.</p>
<p>And when you eat is as important as what you eat.</p>
<p>In this study, they saw something really interesting,</p>
<p>which was that not only did restricting food</p>
<p>to a particular phase of the 24 hour cycle</p>
<p>benefit things like lean body mass and fat loss</p>
<p>and a number of health parameters</p>
<p>that I&rsquo;ll talk about in a moment,</p>
<p>but it also anchored all the gene systems of the body</p>
<p>and provided a more regular stable</p>
<p>so-called circadian rhythm or 24 hour rhythm.</p>
<p>You may be surprised to learn that 80%,</p>
<p>80% of the genes in your body and brain</p>
<p>are on a 24 hour schedule.</p>
<p>That is they change their levels going from high to low</p>
<p>and back to high again across the 24 hour cycle.</p>
<p>And when those genes are high at the appropriate times</p>
<p>and low at the appropriate times,</p>
<p>meaning their expression is high and low</p>
<p>at the appropriate times,</p>
<p>and therefore the proper RNAs and proteins are made</p>
<p>because DNA encodes for RNA,</p>
<p>RNA is translated into proteins.</p>
<p>When that happens, your health benefits.</p>
<p>When those genes are not expressed at the right times,</p>
<p>when they&rsquo;re higher or low at the wrong times</p>
<p>of each 24 hour cycle,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when you get negative health effects.</p>
<p>This study showed that when mice restrict their eating</p>
<p>to an eight hour period within the most active phase</p>
<p>of their 24 hour cycle,</p>
<p>many of the genes that are associated</p>
<p>with these so-called circadian and clocks,</p>
<p>these genes have names like PER, BMAL, CRY1, et cetera.</p>
<p>Those so-called clock genes</p>
<p>underwent a very regular entrainment,</p>
<p>a locking in to the proper 24 hour schedule.</p>
<p>And while this was in mice,</p>
<p>we now know that this also occurs in humans.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve said before on this podcast, and I&rsquo;ll say it again,</p>
<p>that light and when we view light is the primary way</p>
<p>in which these genes and the clock systems of our body</p>
<p>get organized or entrained,</p>
<p>meaning matched to the outside light dark cycle.</p>
<p>So viewing light early in the day and in the afternoon</p>
<p>and as much as possible all day, great.</p>
<p>Ideally that sunlight.</p>
<p>Avoiding light in the middle of the night is also great.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s great because it causes the increases</p>
<p>in particular genes and the decreases in particular genes</p>
<p>in every cell throughout your body</p>
<p>at the appropriate times.</p>
<p>The second most powerful timekeeper or Zeitgeber</p>
<p>as it&rsquo;s called is food and when you eat.</p>
<p>And in this study, the results they saw,</p>
<p>underscore this point,</p>
<p>what they saw is that the peaks in these clock genes</p>
<p>became very regular.</p>
<p>And the dips in these clock genes became very regular.</p>
<p>And that led to a whole host</p>
<p>of really important positive health effects.</p>
<p>Conversely, when mice ate whenever they wanted</p>
<p>across the 24 hour cycle,</p>
<p>these clock genes became really out of whack</p>
<p>and the negative health consequences</p>
<p>were the downstream result of these changes</p>
<p>in these clock genes.</p>
<p>This has now also been shown to be true for humans.</p>
<p>So if you want to be healthy,</p>
<p>you want your organ health,</p>
<p>your metabolic health to be entrained properly.</p>
<p>One of the most important things you can do</p>
<p>is to view light at the appropriate times</p>
<p>of each 24 hour schedule</p>
<p>and to not view light at other times of that schedule</p>
<p>and to eat at the appropriate time of each 24 hour day.</p>
<p>Now, again, there are rare instances that we will discuss</p>
<p>when skipping entire days or entire 24 hour cycles</p>
<p>of eating can be beneficial.</p>
<p>But for now we&rsquo;re talking about schedules</p>
<p>of time-restricted feeding that involve a window of feeding</p>
<p>that falls during your more active phase.</p>
<p>So during the daytime,</p>
<p>putting aside people that work shift work,</p>
<p>during the daytime is when you want to eat.</p>
<p>And this eight hour feeding window</p>
<p>provided a very strong reinforcing signal</p>
<p>that combines with light to ensure that these genes</p>
<p>are expressed at the appropriate times.</p>
<p>The short takeaway from this</p>
<p>is you probably want to think about</p>
<p>and perhaps even engage in time-restricted feeding.</p>
<p>So as I mentioned earlier,</p>
<p>when mice can eat around the clock, bad things happen.</p>
<p>And one of the bad things that happens</p>
<p>is that the liver suffers.</p>
<p>The liver is involved in all sorts of things,</p>
<p>production of important hormones and other factors</p>
<p>related to metabolism.</p>
<p>And when mice can eat around the clock,</p>
<p>their livers got very sick, fatty deposits in the liver,</p>
<p>other factors in the liver,</p>
<p>essentially taking down the pathway of liver disease.</p>
<p>The time-restricted feeding essentially reversed that</p>
<p>or led in many cases to even healthier liver conditions.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s based on this study,</p>
<p>but also additional studies also now in humans.</p>
<p>So restricting your feeding</p>
<p>to a particular window every 24 hour cycle</p>
<p>has clearly been shown now in mice and in humans</p>
<p>to enhance liver health, which is wonderful.</p>
<p>How does it do this?</p>
<p>Well, it happens because food intake,</p>
<p>as I mentioned earlier,</p>
<p>sets certain conditions in the body</p>
<p>that last for a period of time.</p>
<p>Anytime we eat, whether or not we are a mouse or a human,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a period of time</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s required for so-called digestion,</p>
<p>but also gastric emptying and other processes</p>
<p>related to breaking down that food and utilizing it.</p>
<p>And that is an active process.</p>
<p>It requires energy.</p>
<p>And that process of breaking down food</p>
<p>involves certain cellular functions</p>
<p>that if they&rsquo;re ongoing throughout the 24 hour cycle</p>
<p>or even extended too far across the 24 hour cycle,</p>
<p>meaning you&rsquo;re eating across a 14 or a 16 hour</p>
<p>or an 18 hour window, that causes serious problems.</p>
<p>And this has now been established</p>
<p>because of the fact that it increases the expression</p>
<p>of different proteins and genes in the body,</p>
<p>such as TNF alpha, IL-6, IL-1, what are all those things?</p>
<p>They are pro-inflammatory markers.</p>
<p>So the reason that the liver gets sick</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re eating too often</p>
<p>is because inflammatory markers are increased.</p>
<p>These inflammatory markers are not inherently bad.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re there for a reason,</p>
<p>but they are there in order to respond</p>
<p>to certain challenges, immune challenges,</p>
<p>or the ingestion of food and the breakdown of food.</p>
<p>But then in an ideal circumstance,</p>
<p>they are reduced in the period</p>
<p>in which there&rsquo;s no food present in the digestive tract</p>
<p>or in which there&rsquo;s very little food</p>
<p>present in the digestive tract.</p>
<p>So by eating around the clock,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re making yourself sicker.</p>
<p>By eating at restricted periods of time each 24 hour day,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re actually making yourself healthier</p>
<p>and you are activating certain processes</p>
<p>that can positively impact both weight,</p>
<p>either maintenance or loss of weight.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll talk about weight gain a little later</p>
<p>and positively impacting things like liver health.</p>
<p>Also the expression of different things</p>
<p>related to brown fat,</p>
<p>the fat that increases your metabolism.</p>
<p>We will return to this also a little bit later</p>
<p>and blood glucose regulation.</p>
<p>So the takeaway from this study,</p>
<p>in fact, there are many takeaways from this study,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s so wonderful,</p>
<p>is that liver health, bile acid metabolism,</p>
<p>energy expenditure, inflammation, liver metabolites,</p>
<p>many, many aspects of our health</p>
<p>are impacted by when we eat, not just what we eat.</p>
<p>As we move forward and we talk about intermittent fasting</p>
<p>for eight hour windows, six hour windows, 12 hour windows,</p>
<p>for all sorts of different intents and purposes,</p>
<p>I want to start to establish a foundational protocol</p>
<p>that all of us, any of us can use</p>
<p>in order to maximize your particular goals.</p>
<p>There are some absolutes within this realm</p>
<p>of time-restricted feeding.</p>
<p>Here are a couple of absolutes</p>
<p>that you would want to consider.</p>
<p>First of all, it pays off in the metabolic sense</p>
<p>and in the health sense</p>
<p>and in the weight maintenance or loss sense</p>
<p>to not ingest any food in the first hour after waking</p>
<p>and potentially for longer.</p>
<p>So I want to repeat that.</p>
<p>One of the key pillars of intermittent fasting</p>
<p>is that for the first hour after you wake up</p>
<p>and potentially for longer to not ingest any food, okay?</p>
<p>The second major pillar that&rsquo;s well-supported by research</p>
<p>is that for the two and ideally three hours</p>
<p>prior to bedtime, you also don&rsquo;t ingest any food</p>
<p>or liquid calories for that matter.</p>
<p>And we will talk about what it means to break a fast</p>
<p>and whether or not certain liquids,</p>
<p>even coffee and tea can break a fast, et cetera,</p>
<p>in a few moments.</p>
<p>But just as a foundation,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very clear from the research in humans</p>
<p>that not eating any food or ingesting any calories,</p>
<p>liquid or otherwise,</p>
<p>for the first 60 minutes after waking up each day</p>
<p>and for the two to three hours prior to your bedtime,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s ideal for the parameters</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve discussed earlier,</p>
<p>all the different things like weight and liver health</p>
<p>and metabolic health and so forth.</p>
<p>The two most common questions about intermittent fasting</p>
<p>are when is the ideal time for the eating window?</p>
<p>Is it early in the day, the middle of the day,</p>
<p>or later in the day?</p>
<p>And how long should that eating window be?</p>
<p>Should it be eight hours?</p>
<p>We already heard why the eight hour window</p>
<p>was first established.</p>
<p>It was because of these lab conditions</p>
<p>and the conditions of the particular relationship</p>
<p>of the graduate student involved,</p>
<p>or should it be seven hours or six hours or 12 hours?</p>
<p>Turns out that there&rsquo;s some general frameworks</p>
<p>that we can follow in order to answer these questions.</p>
<p>As we move into this portion of the discussion,</p>
<p>I want to highlight a very important reference</p>
<p>that just came out, literally came out last week</p>
<p>in the journal Endocrinology Reviews.</p>
<p>And the title of this review is time-restricted eating</p>
<p>for the prevention and management of metabolic diseases.</p>
<p>Although the data in this paper</p>
<p>go well beyond metabolic diseases.</p>
<p>This is a paper from Sachin Panda&rsquo;s lab.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very lengthy review with an enormous table</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s beautifully organized,</p>
<p>that scripts out all the studies done in humans,</p>
<p>well over a hundred studies,</p>
<p>looking at time-restricted feeding in athletes,</p>
<p>men, women, children, diabetes, no diabetes, et cetera,</p>
<p>with detailed references and description of the outcomes.</p>
<p>Spent a lot of time with this review,</p>
<p>even though it just came out recently,</p>
<p>and is a absolute goldmine resource.</p>
<p>It is also the major resource</p>
<p>for everything I&rsquo;m about to tell you</p>
<p>if you would like to delve deeper into the material.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s deal with this first question</p>
<p>of when is the ideal feeding window?</p>
<p>And here again, we&rsquo;re thinking about a schedule of eating</p>
<p>that involves eating at least once every 24 hours,</p>
<p>not two day or three day or every other day fast.</p>
<p>So it turns out that the answer to the question,</p>
<p>when is it best to eat is actually best answered</p>
<p>by thinking about the other side of the coin,</p>
<p>which is when is it best to fast?</p>
<p>So because we are fasting during sleep,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very clear that it&rsquo;s best to extend</p>
<p>the sleep-related fast either into the morning</p>
<p>or to start it in the evening.</p>
<p>Now this might seem kind of obvious,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s actually not so obvious.</p>
<p>You could place that feeding window early in the day,</p>
<p>middle of the day or late in the day.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s think about what happens when we sleep.</p>
<p>When we sleep, our body undergoes a number</p>
<p>of different processes in the brain and body</p>
<p>in order to recover the cells and tissues.</p>
<p>Many of you have probably heard of autophagy,</p>
<p>which is essentially a cleaning up,</p>
<p>a gobbling up of dead cells</p>
<p>and cells that are injured or sick.</p>
<p>And this is a natural process that occurs</p>
<p>and it occurs mainly during sleep,</p>
<p>although not only during sleep.</p>
<p>Fasting of any kind does tend to enhance autophagy.</p>
<p>It is not the only way to create autophagic conditions.</p>
<p>Autophagic conditions can be created simply</p>
<p>by following a sub caloric diet.</p>
<p>And there are other things that one can do</p>
<p>in order to trigger autophagy,</p>
<p>but fasting does trigger autophagy.</p>
<p>So when we&rsquo;re asleep,</p>
<p>the bad cells are getting gobbled up and eaten.</p>
<p>And the good cells also are undergoing</p>
<p>certain repair mechanisms mainly related to,</p>
<p>or at least governed by those circadian genes</p>
<p>that we talked about earlier, those clock genes.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re already fasting when you&rsquo;re asleep</p>
<p>and how deep you are into that fast depends</p>
<p>on how long it was since your last meal.</p>
<p>So if you fast early in the day</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;ve been asleep for five, six, seven, eight hours,</p>
<p>I would hope somewhere between six and eight hours</p>
<p>for most people is going to be beneficial.</p>
<p>When you wake up, I mentioned earlier</p>
<p>that you don&rsquo;t want to eat</p>
<p>for at least the first 60 minutes after waking,</p>
<p>but were you to extend that fasting to say 9 a.m., 10 a.m.,</p>
<p>11 a.m. or even 12 noon or later,</p>
<p>you are taking advantage of the deep fast</p>
<p>that you were in during sleep</p>
<p>and certainly toward the end of sleep.</p>
<p>Now, why do I say deep fast?</p>
<p>Well, because when we eat,</p>
<p>the clearance of that food from our gut</p>
<p>and the processes in our cells and organs</p>
<p>that are related to digestion</p>
<p>and the utilization of that food</p>
<p>takes about five to six hours.</p>
<p>So if you eat a meal and that meal lasts 10 minutes,</p>
<p>20 minutes, or 30 minutes, or even an hour,</p>
<p>and then you stop eating, you&rsquo;ve stopped eating,</p>
<p>but you are not fasting at that point.</p>
<p>You can say you&rsquo;re fasting</p>
<p>because you&rsquo;re no longer putting food</p>
<p>into your digestive tract,</p>
<p>but you are not in a fasted state.</p>
<p>You are not under conditions of fasting.</p>
<p>Later, I&rsquo;ll talk about things that you can do</p>
<p>to accelerate the transition into fasting.</p>
<p>So one thing is certain,</p>
<p>that you want your eating window to be tacked</p>
<p>or attached to your sleep-based fasting</p>
<p>in a way that makes it easier for you</p>
<p>to get into the fasted state for a period of time.</p>
<p>So we can view that point from the perspective</p>
<p>of best, better, and worst, okay?</p>
<p>So if you are like most people and you sleep at night,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re waking up somewhere around 6.30, 7 a.m.,</p>
<p>or maybe even 8 a.m.,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say you were to push your fasting window out</p>
<p>such that you started eating at noon,</p>
<p>and then you stopped eating at 6 p.m.</p>
<p>Well, then you&rsquo;re not eating from 6 p.m.</p>
<p>until let&rsquo;s say your bedtime is 10 p.m.,</p>
<p>but from 6 p.m. to 10 p.m.,</p>
<p>your body is not yet in a fasted state</p>
<p>because you just ate.</p>
<p>However, you&rsquo;re starting to taper</p>
<p>into a fasted state before sleep,</p>
<p>and then all through sleep,</p>
<p>and until the next morning and late morning,</p>
<p>you are actually in a fasted state.</p>
<p>Now, most people find it very hard</p>
<p>to only eat in the middle of the day.</p>
<p>So while that&rsquo;s best, it&rsquo;s ideal</p>
<p>for sake of the fasting-related improvements in health,</p>
<p>it is not ideal, and it&rsquo;s not very applicable</p>
<p>to most work and family and social situations.</p>
<p>Most people eat breakfast with others</p>
<p>and or eat dinner with others.</p>
<p>Some people eat lunch with others,</p>
<p>but in general, it&rsquo;s hard to restrict your feeding window</p>
<p>to just the absolute middle of the day.</p>
<p>But from a purely health perspective,</p>
<p>in a very objective way,</p>
<p>that would be the ideal situation.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s imagine a different pattern of eating</p>
<p>where the feeding window starts in the afternoon,</p>
<p>starts around 2 or even 3 p.m.</p>
<p>Some people don&rsquo;t have much trouble</p>
<p>or they can train themselves</p>
<p>to get their feeding window out</p>
<p>to 2 or 3 p.m., and then they will eat</p>
<p>until 10 or 11 p.m., right?</p>
<p>If you do the math, you realize</p>
<p>that that feeding window is still pretty short.</p>
<p>It still constitutes what we would call</p>
<p>intermittent fasting or time-restricted feeding.</p>
<p>But assuming that they go to bed</p>
<p>around 11 p.m. or midnight,</p>
<p>they are not actually fasted in sleep</p>
<p>because for the first six hours or so of sleep,</p>
<p>maybe five, but probably more like six hours of sleep,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re still digesting the food</p>
<p>that they consumed late in the night.</p>
<p>It does appear beneficial</p>
<p>to grab a hold of that sleep-related fast,</p>
<p>meaning you don&rsquo;t want your feeding window</p>
<p>to be too close to bedtime.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why we came up with this</p>
<p>kind of foundational pillar</p>
<p>that I discussed with Sachin earlier,</p>
<p>which is at least no eating for the first hour after waking,</p>
<p>but also no eating within two to three hours prior to bed.</p>
<p>And because we all need to sleep</p>
<p>and sleep is exceedingly important</p>
<p>for our health of all kinds,</p>
<p>you want to prioritize sleep,</p>
<p>but because we also have to eat,</p>
<p>then you start to think about this</p>
<p>and maybe it&rsquo;s not so good to push that feeding window</p>
<p>too late in the day, because when you go to sleep,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not actually capitalizing</p>
<p>on the sleep-related fasting.</p>
<p>Now, it&rsquo;s not just the case</p>
<p>that it&rsquo;s easiest to fast while in sleep,</p>
<p>although that&rsquo;s true because when we&rsquo;re asleep,</p>
<p>typically we&rsquo;re not hungry or looking for food</p>
<p>or foraging for food or wanting food</p>
<p>or trying to resist food.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re just sleeping.</p>
<p>There is something special about the fasting</p>
<p>that occurs during sleep</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s associated with a number of processes</p>
<p>that relate to the so-called glymphatic system,</p>
<p>the movement of lymph-like fluids</p>
<p>and other fluids through the brain,</p>
<p>a kind of sweeping out garbage disposal, if you will,</p>
<p>a clearing out of the metabolic debris</p>
<p>and some of the autophagy that&rsquo;s associated</p>
<p>with bad processes in the brain.</p>
<p>So we could do a whole episode on this,</p>
<p>but essentially during sleep</p>
<p>and in particular during fasted states of sleep,</p>
<p>we are undergoing a number of automatic cellular processes</p>
<p>that clear out debris from our brain,</p>
<p>enhance cognition or at least offset dementia.</p>
<p>This is now well-established,</p>
<p>as well as a number of the same processes</p>
<p>occurring in the organs of our body.</p>
<p>So what we&rsquo;re starting to see here</p>
<p>is that there are a number of constraints</p>
<p>on when you can eat.</p>
<p>Now, I would be remiss if I didn&rsquo;t acknowledge</p>
<p>the social constraints and the real life constraints.</p>
<p>Some of us, because we want to eat with our family</p>
<p>and because our family or our significant others eat</p>
<p>around eight or 9 p.m.</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s the only time we&rsquo;re together,</p>
<p>you have to eat late in the day.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s certainly not a sin.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying that&rsquo;s good or bad.</p>
<p>Here, we&rsquo;re trying to establish, if you recall,</p>
<p>best, better, and worst.</p>
<p>So from both a practical and a health perspective</p>
<p>and a purely objective view</p>
<p>of how intermittent fasting works and can benefit us,</p>
<p>starting to eat each day somewhere around 10 a.m.</p>
<p>or around noon,</p>
<p>and then allowing a feeding window</p>
<p>that goes until six or maybe 8 p.m.,</p>
<p>that seems to me, at least based on the data</p>
<p>and what I understand about typical cultures</p>
<p>where people eat in the daytime and in the evening,</p>
<p>that seems to me like the kind of schedule</p>
<p>that will allow you to get the most</p>
<p>out of intermittent fasting, time-restricted feeding,</p>
<p>but does not set you up to be really out of sync</p>
<p>with the social rhythms in most cultures.</p>
<p>If you think about it from the perspective</p>
<p>of, say, a noon to eight feeding window,</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;ll find is that you&rsquo;re able to eat lunch</p>
<p>with others, if you like, or by yourself.</p>
<p>You will be able to eat dinner at a reasonable hour,</p>
<p>at least in most countries, in most cultures,</p>
<p>eating dinner somewhere between 6.30 and 7 p.m.</p>
<p>is typical.</p>
<p>When you say a feeding window that goes until eight,</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t mean sitting down to dinner at eight.</p>
<p>That means your last bite of food</p>
<p>or ingestion of any liquid calories was at 8 p.m.</p>
<p>Assuming that you go to bed somewhere between 10 p.m.</p>
<p>and 1 a.m., that allows this tapering off</p>
<p>or this transition from feeding to a fasted state</p>
<p>and still allows you to capitalize</p>
<p>on the special period of fasting</p>
<p>that is sleep-related fasting.</p>
<p>And again, I want to emphasize that the fasting</p>
<p>that occurs during sleep is vital</p>
<p>and eating too close to sleep will disrupt</p>
<p>that fasting-related sleep.</p>
<p>Now, there are a number of caveats</p>
<p>and details related to this,</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s an important caveat in detail</p>
<p>related to people that are specifically interested</p>
<p>in increasing or maintaining muscle mass.</p>
<p>So first, let&rsquo;s talk about food volume and food type</p>
<p>and how that relates to whether or not you quickly</p>
<p>or slowly enter a fasted state.</p>
<p>Because clearly when we talk about a feeding window,</p>
<p>that feeding window could include</p>
<p>any number of different foods.</p>
<p>It could involve cake and ice cream, pizza, hamburgers,</p>
<p>plants, fruit, whatever it is,</p>
<p>or it could involve just fats or just proteins, et cetera.</p>
<p>There are at least three factors that are going to govern</p>
<p>how quickly you transition from ingesting food</p>
<p>to a fasted state.</p>
<p>Remember, as you ingest your last bite or sip of calories,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s not when the fast begins.</p>
<p>That might be when the fasting begins on your watch</p>
<p>or on one of these apps that I&rsquo;ll refer to later,</p>
<p>which can help you track your fasting and eating windows,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s not when it actually begins</p>
<p>because your body is still seeing food.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re actually carrying around food inside of you,</p>
<p>even though you&rsquo;re not putting it into your mouth,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re still eating in some sense.</p>
<p>So it should be somewhat obvious that very large meals</p>
<p>are going to take longer to digest than very small meals.</p>
<p>So that will impact how slowly or quickly you migrate</p>
<p>from a fed state to a fasted state.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no way I can spell out what exact volume of food</p>
<p>you should ingest based on the size of your stomach</p>
<p>and et cetera, but you&rsquo;re all familiar</p>
<p>with being extremely full, very full, comfortably full,</p>
<p>somewhat full, or not feeling full and feeling hungry.</p>
<p>So learning to gauge food volume is important.</p>
<p>Also foods that include some fats or a lot of fats</p>
<p>will tend to slow gastric emptying time.</p>
<p>And depending on the kind of fats,</p>
<p>it could mean that a given meal is digested</p>
<p>within three hours versus five hours.</p>
<p>So more fats might be a large meal with a lot of fats</p>
<p>has been can take five or six hours.</p>
<p>A smaller meal with less fat</p>
<p>is going to be digested more quickly.</p>
<p>Consuming calories in liquid form is going to mean</p>
<p>that gastric emptying time is going to be faster.</p>
<p>And then of course there&rsquo;s the glucose</p>
<p>and the insulin aspect to it,</p>
<p>which is that foods that lead to big steep rises in glucose</p>
<p>like pure sugars, then your glucose will drop.</p>
<p>However, if they&rsquo;re combined with fats,</p>
<p>then it tends to be a more gradual rise in glucose</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s more sustained, et cetera.</p>
<p>Fibrous foods will also create a more long-lasting</p>
<p>sustained release in glucose.</p>
<p>The important thing here is to establish a feeding window</p>
<p>that you can comfortably manage, okay?</p>
<p>Meaning that on average,</p>
<p>you can obey a six hour feeding window</p>
<p>or an eight hour feeding window or a 10 hour feeding window.</p>
<p>And then to place that feeding window</p>
<p>in a social and life context</p>
<p>that you can manage on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Now there are two key points</p>
<p>that have been gleaned from the scientific data</p>
<p>about this feeding window and when to place it.</p>
<p>And this is based on a really important experiment</p>
<p>that Sachin and his colleagues have been doing.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a website that they have,</p>
<p>zero cost website called My Circadian Clock.</p>

<p>There are a number of important resources there,</p>
<p>but what they&rsquo;ve done is they&rsquo;ve examined</p>
<p>the feeding behavior of thousands of people.</p>
<p>People will take a picture of the food they&rsquo;re about to eat</p>
<p>and it enters into their account,</p>
<p>maybe your account if you create one on My Circadian Clock.</p>
<p>And they do this over many days or weeks.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s great about this is it establishes</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s essentially called a fetogram,</p>
<p>a time in which people ate.</p>
<p>And a number of important findings have emerged</p>
<p>from these fetograms across large populations</p>
<p>of people in different time zones</p>
<p>with different schedules, et cetera.</p>
<p>First of all, almost everybody</p>
<p>underestimates their feeding window.</p>
<p>Meaning people who think that they are</p>
<p>on an eight hour feeding window or six hour feeding window,</p>
<p>when their data are analyzed,</p>
<p>it almost is always the case</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re actually on a feeding window</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s one or even two hours longer than they think.</p>
<p>You think, well, how could that possibly be?</p>
<p>If people are taking their first bite at noon</p>
<p>and they&rsquo;re taking their last bite at 8 p.m.,</p>
<p>well, that must mean that they are on that feeding window</p>
<p>of eight hours.</p>
<p>And it turns out that people cheat,</p>
<p>but they don&rsquo;t cheat in any kind of obvious way.</p>
<p>They might have, you know, a glass of wine after dinner,</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;ll have a cup of tea and a little bite of a cookie.</p>
<p>And so when people are honest and they are honest</p>
<p>in most cases for this experiment,</p>
<p>what you find is that most people&rsquo;s eating window</p>
<p>is actually quite a bit longer.</p>
<p>So in discussing this with Sachin</p>
<p>and reviewing the literature,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s clear that if you&rsquo;d like to be</p>
<p>on a 10 hour feeding window,</p>
<p>that you should probably select an eight hour feeding window</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s always a little bit of a taper</p>
<p>on either side of that eating window.</p>
<p>Very few people are extremely strict</p>
<p>about these eating windows.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just hard to do in the context of life events</p>
<p>and social gatherings and family and so forth.</p>
<p>Okay, so as we build forward your ideal fasting</p>
<p>slash time-restricted feeding schedule,</p>
<p>we now have several different rules that we can list out.</p>
<p>First, at least no food for the first hour</p>
<p>after waking up, at least one hour.</p>
<p>Two, no food intake for two and ideally three hours</p>
<p>prior to your bedtime.</p>
<p>Three, if you want to select an eight hour feeding window,</p>
<p>then you should probably focus on a six</p>
<p>or seven hour feeding window because in reality,</p>
<p>your feeding window is going to be longer.</p>
<p>Reality meaning real life constraints.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;d like to be on a 10 hour feeding window,</p>
<p>you should probably select an eight</p>
<p>or a nine hour feeding window</p>
<p>because the way it plays out is that people</p>
<p>almost always eat outside of their eating window somewhat.</p>
<p>The other nice thing about selecting</p>
<p>a slightly shorter eating window</p>
<p>than is comfortable for you is that it takes into account</p>
<p>that as you take your last bite</p>
<p>or your last sip of calories,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s this time or taper before which you are actually</p>
<p>in a fasted state.</p>
<p>And because you&rsquo;re eating different things</p>
<p>on different days, presumably,</p>
<p>some foods leave your gut more quickly.</p>
<p>Some things spike your insulin</p>
<p>and your glucose more than others.</p>
<p>Sometimes you eat more fat, sometimes less fat.</p>
<p>This allows you to fall well within the margins</p>
<p>of the benefits of time restricted feeding</p>
<p>that have been demonstrated in humans,</p>
<p>which generally involve an eight hour window or so.</p>
<p>So I think this eight hour window or six hour window</p>
<p>is a good thing to shoot for, for most people.</p>
<p>Some people, and we will discuss the exceptions,</p>
<p>but some people truly are exceptions to this.</p>
<p>They just require more food.</p>
<p>And along those lines,</p>
<p>I just now briefly want to touch on some of the studies</p>
<p>that have looked at using a very short feeding window</p>
<p>of about four hours.</p>
<p>Nowadays, a number of people</p>
<p>are doing the so-called one meal per day</p>
<p>or are restricting their feeding window</p>
<p>to just four hours or six hours.</p>
<p>And that turns out to be an interesting strategy.</p>
<p>And the data around it actually are a little bit surprising.</p>
<p>One surprising thing to leap out</p>
<p>of this massive literature review</p>
<p>on time restricted feeding in humans</p>
<p>is that relatively short feeding windows</p>
<p>of say four to six hours</p>
<p>do produce a number of positive health effects,</p>
<p>things like increased insulin sensitivity,</p>
<p>which we know is good.</p>
<p>Remember type two diabetes</p>
<p>is a reduction in insulin sensitivity,</p>
<p>improvements in beta cell function in the pancreas,</p>
<p>decreased blood pressure, decreased oxidative stress,</p>
<p>decreases in things like evening appetite.</p>
<p>So positive health effects</p>
<p>and psychological effects in general.</p>
<p>However, they either produce no change in body weight</p>
<p>or they tend to produce even increases in body weight.</p>
<p>Now, of course, there&rsquo;s variation between individuals</p>
<p>and between studies, but this is somewhat surprising.</p>
<p>So the eight hour feeding window</p>
<p>seems to be very beneficial</p>
<p>across almost all the parameters that we&rsquo;ve discussed,</p>
<p>inflammation, weight loss, fat loss, et cetera.</p>
<p>And adherence, I should mention,</p>
<p>people&rsquo;s ability to stick to the diet</p>
<p>seems quite good on this eight hour feeding windows.</p>
<p>But when people try and undergo</p>
<p>very short feeding windows of four to six hours,</p>
<p>it seems that they are overeating in that four to six hours,</p>
<p>at least overeating with respect to their metabolic needs.</p>
<p>Now, the contrast to this</p>
<p>is the so-called one meal per day schedule.</p>
<p>Very few studies on one meal per day.</p>
<p>One meal per day,</p>
<p>unless it&rsquo;s a very, very long meal and sort of feast,</p>
<p>typically would not last four to six hours.</p>
<p>I guess it sort of depends on how you define a meal.</p>
<p>But when you look at the very few,</p>
<p>I should emphasize again,</p>
<p>very few studies on one meal per day,</p>
<p>people typically maintain or lose weight</p>
<p>on the one meal per day schedule.</p>
<p>So what we can say is that the seven</p>
<p>to nine hour feeding window</p>
<p>produces all of the major health benefits</p>
<p>of time-restricted feeding,</p>
<p>as well as being pretty straightforward</p>
<p>for most people to adhere to on a regular basis.</p>
<p>And on a regular basis turns out to be very important.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll get back to that point in a moment.</p>
<p>Whereas the four to six hour eating window</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t seem to serve people</p>
<p>as well as say a seven or eight hour eating window,</p>
<p>simply because people are overeating</p>
<p>during that eating window.</p>
<p>And the one meal per day,</p>
<p>while perhaps ideal for certain people&rsquo;s schedules,</p>
<p>may actually cause people to under eat.</p>
<p>And in some cases that might be what people want.</p>
<p>They actually want to under eat.</p>
<p>But when we start thinking about performance</p>
<p>in work and in sport,</p>
<p>and when we start considering hormone health</p>
<p>and hormone production, fertility,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when we can really start to look</p>
<p>at the seven to nine hour feeding window</p>
<p>versus the four to six hour feeding window</p>
<p>versus the one meal per day type feeding window</p>
<p>with some different objectivity.</p>
<p>We can start to look at it through a different lens</p>
<p>because it turns out that when you place the feeding window</p>
<p>and how long that feeding window is</p>
<p>actually will impact a number of other things</p>
<p>in particular hormones that can be very important</p>
<p>for a number of things related to sex and reproduction,</p>
<p>can be related to performance at work,</p>
<p>performance in athleticism.</p>
<p>And there are excellent studies on this.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s explore those now.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s talk about some conditions</p>
<p>where having the feeding window early in the day</p>
<p>would actually be very beneficial.</p>
<p>There was a study that was published recently</p>
<p>in Cell Reports, again, Cell Press Journal,</p>
<p>excellent journal, peer reviewed,</p>
<p>very stringent from Aoyama et al.</p>
<p>So this is A-O-Y-A-M-A et al.</p>
<p>This was published just recently in July, 2021</p>
<p>that looked at the distribution of protein intake</p>
<p>in different meals delivered either early in the day</p>
<p>or later in the day.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m summarizing here quite a lot,</p>
<p>but I should mention that this study was performed</p>
<p>in both mice and humans, same paper, mice and humans.</p>
<p>And involved hypertrophy training,</p>
<p>essentially increasing the weight bearing of given limbs</p>
<p>to try and induce hypertrophy,</p>
<p>which is the growth of muscle tissue.</p>
<p>It does appear that muscle tissue is better able</p>
<p>to undergo hypertrophy by virtue of the fact</p>
<p>that there&rsquo;s better or enhanced protein synthesis</p>
<p>early in the day because of the expression</p>
<p>of one of these particular clock genes called BMAL, B-M-A-L.</p>
<p>BMAL regulates a number of different protein synthesis</p>
<p>pathways within muscle cells,</p>
<p>such that eating protein early in the day</p>
<p>supports muscle tissue maintenance and or growth.</p>
<p>And in this study,</p>
<p>they also looked at the effects of supplementing</p>
<p>so-called BCAAs, branched chain amino acids,</p>
<p>which is popular in bodybuilding circles</p>
<p>and in strength training circles.</p>
<p>And BCAAs are essential components</p>
<p>of a number of different foods,</p>
<p>but can also be supplemented.</p>
<p>The takeaway of the study is pretty straightforward.</p>
<p>However, the takeaway is if your main interest</p>
<p>is maintaining and or building muscle,</p>
<p>then it can be beneficial to ingest protein</p>
<p>early in the day.</p>
<p>You would still want to obey this,</p>
<p>what we&rsquo;re calling a kind of foundational rule</p>
<p>of not eating any food for the first hour post waking,</p>
<p>or at least the first hour post waking.</p>
<p>And the cutoff for when you would want to eat protein</p>
<p>would be sometime before 10 a.m.</p>
<p>And there I&rsquo;m averaging across a number</p>
<p>of different situations.</p>
<p>But in general, this BMAL expression is such that,</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s say you wake up at 7 a.m.</p>
<p>Your main interest is in hypertrophy</p>
<p>or maintenance of muscle.</p>
<p>Then you would want to ingest some protein</p>
<p>sometime before 10 a.m.</p>
<p>But obviously, if you&rsquo;re interested in getting</p>
<p>the health effects of intermittent fasting,</p>
<p>that you wouldn&rsquo;t ingest any food</p>
<p>for at least the first 60 minutes upon waking.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s not as if at 10 a.m. a gate slammed shut</p>
<p>and you can&rsquo;t generate hypertrophy.</p>
<p>Of course, that&rsquo;s not the case.</p>
<p>However, it&rsquo;s very interesting that it doesn&rsquo;t matter</p>
<p>when the resistance training,</p>
<p>the load bearing exercise occurs in the 24 hour cycle.</p>
<p>So whether or not, in other words,</p>
<p>people are training early in the day</p>
<p>or they&rsquo;re training late in the day,</p>
<p>it still appears that ingesting protein</p>
<p>early in the day favors hypertrophy.</p>
<p>Or that one is better, or I should say more easily</p>
<p>able to access hypertrophy by way of these clock regulated</p>
<p>protein synthesis mechanisms by ingesting protein</p>
<p>early in the day.</p>
<p>In no way, shape or form does this study say</p>
<p>that ingesting protein later in the day</p>
<p>is somehow bad for you.</p>
<p>It just emphasizes the positive effects</p>
<p>of ingesting protein early in the day</p>
<p>for sake of muscle maintenance and or hypertrophy.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re somebody who&rsquo;s mainly concerned</p>
<p>with muscle maintenance and hypertrophy,</p>
<p>then it may make sense to move that feeding window</p>
<p>earlier in the day.</p>
<p>And certainly there are people out there</p>
<p>who are interested in muscle maintenance and hypertrophy</p>
<p>who aren&rsquo;t doing intermittent fasting at all.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s also perfectly fine,</p>
<p>but this just so happens to be an episode</p>
<p>about intermittent fasting and time restricted feeding.</p>
<p>There are of course, modes of eating where one eats</p>
<p>small meals spread throughout the day</p>
<p>or weights meals differently such that meals early</p>
<p>in the day are larger than later in the day or vice versa.</p>
<p>There are in a near infinite number of ways</p>
<p>to organize this.</p>
<p>But if you are somebody who&rsquo;s interested in deriving</p>
<p>the many clearly established health effects</p>
<p>of time restricted feeding,</p>
<p>and you are somebody who would like to maintain</p>
<p>or build muscle,</p>
<p>then ingesting proteins in the early part of the day</p>
<p>would be important to you,</p>
<p>at least on the basis of these results.</p>
<p>And therefore that eight hour window</p>
<p>that we&rsquo;ve established as more or less ideal</p>
<p>shifted to the later part of the day</p>
<p>might not be as beneficial for you.</p>
<p>Now I can just personally say that for me,</p>
<p>when I wake up in the morning,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very easy for me to not eat until noon</p>
<p>or one or 2 p.m.</p>
<p>Eating early in the day is actually somewhat of a challenge.</p>
<p>I discussed this point with Sachin</p>
<p>because we were talking about how is it that one</p>
<p>can move their feeding window</p>
<p>or place themselves onto a different schedule</p>
<p>of intermittent fasting.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s very clear that one needs to provide</p>
<p>a transition period in order for that to happen.</p>
<p>You should allow yourself a transition period</p>
<p>of anywhere from one week to 10 days</p>
<p>in which you shift your feeding window</p>
<p>by about an hour each day or so.</p>
<p>And then once you establish a feeding window</p>
<p>that feels comfortable for you</p>
<p>and that you think you can maintain over time,</p>
<p>that you simply maintain that feeding schedule</p>
<p>for at least 30 days,</p>
<p>but ideally you would do that indefinitely.</p>
<p>Now, this turns out to be important based on data</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;ve gleaned from this my circadian clock,</p>
<p>massive experiment that they&rsquo;ve been doing</p>
<p>where people are entering the times</p>
<p>that they&rsquo;re feeding and eating.</p>
<p>Excuse me, anytime we talk about mice,</p>
<p>I always think about feeding</p>
<p>because I come from a background</p>
<p>and my lab works on both laboratory mice and on humans.</p>
<p>Anytime I think about humans, I think about eating,</p>
<p>but of course they are the same thing.</p>
<p>The interesting thing to emerge</p>
<p>from that very large data set in humans</p>
<p>is that when people log their feeding times,</p>
<p>as I mentioned before, oftentimes they think</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re eating in an eight hour window,</p>
<p>but they are actually eating in a much broader window.</p>
<p>However, even for people that are very good</p>
<p>about restricting their feeding to a four or six</p>
<p>or eight hour window, if they&rsquo;re very strict</p>
<p>about the start and stop times of when they ingest calories,</p>
<p>one of the findings that&rsquo;s really been important to note</p>
<p>is that almost every individual has a lot of drift</p>
<p>in when that eating window resides in their 24 hour period.</p>
<p>In particular on the weekends,</p>
<p>people are either extending or shifting their feeding window</p>
<p>in a way that makes it seem that they&rsquo;ve traveled</p>
<p>to another time zone and are eating</p>
<p>according to another time zone.</p>
<p>And this is extremely important.</p>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, based on the 2012 study</p>
<p>from Sachin&rsquo;s lab, we&rsquo;re eating at a particular phase</p>
<p>of each 24 hour cycle can help enhance the expression</p>
<p>of these clock genes.</p>
<p>If you are eating within a very strict</p>
<p>or semi-strict feeding window,</p>
<p>but that feeding window is migrating around from day to day</p>
<p>or five days a week, you&rsquo;re really organized</p>
<p>about when that falls, let&rsquo;s say for sake of example,</p>
<p>from noon to 8 p.m., noon to 8 p.m., Monday,</p>
<p>noon to 8 p.m., Tuesday, Wednesday, noon to 8 p.m.,</p>
<p>Thursday, and so forth.</p>
<p>But then on a Saturday, it&rsquo;s becoming 11 a.m.</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re ending it early,</p>
<p>or perhaps you&rsquo;re starting early in the day on Sunday,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re having brunch that starts at 9.30 or 10,</p>
<p>and then it&rsquo;s extending out still just eight hours,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s shifting around.</p>
<p>That can cause disruptions</p>
<p>in these circadian clock mechanisms</p>
<p>that cause disruptions in the downstream effects of eating</p>
<p>that are taking at least two to three days to recover from.</p>
<p>So obviously we don&rsquo;t want to be overly neurotic</p>
<p>about this stuff, but because this is an episode</p>
<p>about the science of intermittent fasting</p>
<p>and time-restricted feeding,</p>
<p>as important as how long your feeding window is,</p>
<p>is where that feeding window resides in each 24 hour cycle.</p>
<p>And perhaps even more important than that</p>
<p>is that it be fairly regular</p>
<p>where that feeding window resides.</p>
<p>Because even if you have a very short feeding window,</p>
<p>if it&rsquo;s drifting around from day to day,</p>
<p>that actually offsets a number of the positive health</p>
<p>effects of intermittent fasting.</p>
<p>So to really just underscore the way</p>
<p>that these different pieces</p>
<p>of the biological puzzle fit together,</p>
<p>if you are very strict or semi-strict</p>
<p>about your eight hour feeding window,</p>
<p>but on the weekends that eight hour feeding window</p>
<p>is falling later than it normally would</p>
<p>during the middle of the week,</p>
<p>it is as if you are going to bed later,</p>
<p>even if you&rsquo;re going to bed at the same time,</p>
<p>at least from the perspective of metabolic health,</p>
<p>because of the way that eating impacts these clock genes</p>
<p>and impacts, or I should say,</p>
<p>subtracts the sleep-related fasting</p>
<p>that you would normally experience</p>
<p>if you were to finish eating a couple hours before bedtime.</p>
<p>So again, we don&rsquo;t want to create any overly obsessive</p>
<p>or neurotic focus on this.</p>
<p>I think that most all people could benefit</p>
<p>from a time-restricted feeding schedule,</p>
<p>but they should really think hard about</p>
<p>what they can stick to on a regular basis</p>
<p>and understand that they tend to underestimate</p>
<p>the feeding window that they actually are partaking in</p>
<p>and that they should place that feeding window</p>
<p>in a portion of the 24 hour cycle</p>
<p>that they can be consistent on most days.</p>
<p>And I want to emphasize most again,</p>
<p>because we are not laboratory mice.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have a graduate student coming in</p>
<p>for eight hours a day,</p>
<p>because that&rsquo;s what their significant other</p>
<p>will allow them to do.</p>
<p>And then removing the food from our jowls</p>
<p>and from our cages,</p>
<p>we have access to food pretty much 24 hours a day.</p>
<p>Along those lines, however,</p>
<p>there are things that we can all do</p>
<p>that will allow us to offset some of the drift,</p>
<p>if you will, that we experience,</p>
<p>or that we induce in terms of</p>
<p>when our feeding window occurs,</p>
<p>or that the feeding window might push out a little later</p>
<p>and then therefore start a little later the next day.</p>
<p>There are things that we can do</p>
<p>and there are things that we can take.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;d like to discuss those briefly.</p>
<p>So throughout this episode,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve more or less been alluding to the fact</p>
<p>that when you eat,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s some period of time afterwards</p>
<p>in which you&rsquo;re actually still eating,</p>
<p>at least from the perspective of metabolism,</p>
<p>because glucose is up, insulin is up,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re undergoing different metabolic</p>
<p>and digestive processes that don&rsquo;t really speak to you</p>
<p>being in a fasted state, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just about when you take your last bite</p>
<p>or your last sip.</p>
<p>However, there are things that we can do</p>
<p>to accelerate the transition from a fed state</p>
<p>to a fasted state.</p>
<p>And so I&rsquo;d like to discuss what those are.</p>
<p>And I want to emphasize that the term fed state</p>
<p>is probably a better way to think about it</p>
<p>than eating or not eating,</p>
<p>because we think of eating as the verb,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re eating, we&rsquo;re eating,</p>
<p>okay, we&rsquo;re done eating, I&rsquo;m fasting now,</p>
<p>but you&rsquo;re not actually fasting because you are fed.</p>
<p>So we should really think about fed and unfed states,</p>
<p>because from a cellular processes perspective</p>
<p>and from a health perspective,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s actually what your body and your system</p>
<p>are paying attention to.</p>
<p>And by now with everything that we&rsquo;ve laid out,</p>
<p>I think that should be intuitive to understand.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a fun and exciting concept related to this,</p>
<p>which is glucose clearing.</p>
<p>You may have heard the old adage</p>
<p>that if you take a 20 or 30 minute walk after dinner,</p>
<p>that it accelerates the rate at which you digest that food.</p>
<p>And indeed it does.</p>
<p>Clearing out of glucose from your system</p>
<p>can be accomplished through a number of different means,</p>
<p>but light movement or exercise</p>
<p>does increase gastric emptying time.</p>
<p>So for instance,</p>
<p>if you were to eat a meal that ended at 8 p.m.</p>
<p>and then plop to the couch,</p>
<p>watch TV or get on your computer or go to sleep,</p>
<p>it would be five or six hours</p>
<p>until you have transitioned from a fed state</p>
<p>to a fasted state.</p>
<p>However, you can accelerate that considerably</p>
<p>by taking a 20 or 30 minute, just light walk.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t have to be speed walking.</p>
<p>It certainly doesn&rsquo;t have to be jogging,</p>
<p>but just walking outside or moving around.</p>
<p>So glucose clearing is an important aspect</p>
<p>of the transition from the fed state to the fasted state.</p>
<p>And just a light walk can allow you to do that.</p>
<p>Now, if you can&rsquo;t get outside,</p>
<p>some people will go through the gymnastics,</p>
<p>literally of doing things like air squats and pushups</p>
<p>and things like that.</p>
<p>And indeed, those will increase the expression</p>
<p>of things like glut four</p>
<p>and things that mobilize glucose into muscles</p>
<p>and things of that sort.</p>
<p>But, you know, under most conditions,</p>
<p>most people aren&rsquo;t doing pushups after dinner,</p>
<p>or certainly if you&rsquo;ve had a big meal,</p>
<p>just taking a light walk can be beneficial.</p>
<p>In addition, you could consider doing intense exercise.</p>
<p>Now, you wouldn&rsquo;t necessarily want to do that</p>
<p>immediately after eating.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s take a look at what high intensity training</p>
<p>of any kind does to blood glucose.</p>
<p>Because in this case, it turns out</p>
<p>that when you do high intensity training,</p>
<p>actually has opposite effects on blood glucose,</p>
<p>depending on whether or not you do it early</p>
<p>or later in the day.</p>
<p>So a fairly recent study looked at so-called HIIT training,</p>
<p>high intensity interval training,</p>
<p>which of course can take many different forms.</p>
<p>It can take the form of circuit training with weights.</p>
<p>It can take the form of, you know, burpees and pushups</p>
<p>and sprints and all sorts of different things.</p>
<p>But high intensity interval training is typically training</p>
<p>that gets people&rsquo;s heart rates up, you know,</p>
<p>well above 70% of maximum,</p>
<p>and then brief periods of rest and then repeating.</p>
<p>And how long the high intensity interval training,</p>
<p>of course, will also vary.</p>
<p>There are very brief, you know,</p>
<p>six or 12 or 15 minute workouts.</p>
<p>Some people can carry on with high intensity interval</p>
<p>training for up to 45 or maybe even 60 minutes</p>
<p>in extreme cases.</p>
<p>But when you look at the studies that have explored high</p>
<p>intensity interval training and its effect on blood glucose,</p>
<p>there are a couple of studies that leap out.</p>
<p>For instance,</p>
<p>one that emphasized that blood glucose levels will actually</p>
<p>increase if high intensity interval training is performed</p>
<p>early in the day and will decrease if high intensity</p>
<p>interval training is performed later in the day.</p>
<p>Now the purpose for this exploration was not to explore</p>
<p>clearance of blood glucose for sake of intermittent</p>
<p>fasting.</p>
<p>It was mainly focused on athletic performance and whether or</p>
<p>not that was better early in the day or later in the day,</p>
<p>et cetera.</p>
<p>But we can extract some information from these studies that</p>
<p>are beneficial for sake of understanding glucose clearing.</p>
<p>If you have ingested food throughout the afternoon and</p>
<p>evening and late in the day,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re thinking about going to sleep and you&rsquo;d like to</p>
<p>enter sleep in a way that is less fed and more fasted,</p>
<p>then engaging in high intensity interval training in the</p>
<p>afternoon will lower or evening, I should say,</p>
<p>will lower blood glucose.</p>
<p>And in that way will help you accelerate your transition</p>
<p>into the fasted state,</p>
<p>provided you don&rsquo;t ingest something after the high intensity</p>
<p>interval training.</p>
<p>Now is the increase in blood glucose that occurs from high</p>
<p>intensity interval training early in the day?</p>
<p>Is that detrimental?</p>
<p>Not necessarily.</p>
<p>So that oftentimes is associated with the shuttling of</p>
<p>nutrients to the muscles that have just done a lot of hard</p>
<p>work.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not that high intensity interval training should not</p>
<p>be done early in the day.</p>
<p>In fact, for many people, including myself,</p>
<p>training early in the day,</p>
<p>just for the way that my psychology and biology works is</p>
<p>always better for me than training later in the day.</p>
<p>And the other important thing to mention is that high</p>
<p>intensity interval training done late in the day can be</p>
<p>beneficial from the perspective of glucose clearing,</p>
<p>lowering blood glucose and helping transition from the fed</p>
<p>to the fasted state in preparation for sleep.</p>
<p>However, if you&rsquo;re ingesting caffeine or anything to engage</p>
<p>in that high intensity interval training in a way that</p>
<p>prevents you from getting to sleep,</p>
<p>well then it&rsquo;s going to be detrimental overall.</p>
<p>So the reason I mentioned this is of course,</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s nice to know that light walks after dinner or</p>
<p>any other meal for that matter,</p>
<p>or high intensity interval training provided it&rsquo;s done in</p>
<p>the second half of the day can lower blood glucose and</p>
<p>speed the transition from fed to fasted states.</p>
<p>But I also mention it because what we are really trying to</p>
<p>achieve when we partake in intermittent fasting,</p>
<p>so-called time restricted feeding is what we&rsquo;re really</p>
<p>trying to do is access unfed states or fasted states.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not really about when you eat and what you do.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about extending the duration of the fasting period as</p>
<p>long as you can in a way that&rsquo;s still compatible with your</p>
<p>eating, right?</p>
<p>Not the other way around.</p>
<p>And this gets back to this key feature of our biology,</p>
<p>which is that what we eat, when we eat,</p>
<p>when we exercise, when we view light,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s about setting a context or a set of conditions in your</p>
<p>brain and body.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not so much about the activities that you undergo.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about the activities you undergo and their relationship</p>
<p>to one another over time.</p>
<p>And so in this way,</p>
<p>it really beautifully highlights the way that your biology is</p>
<p>interacting all the time.</p>
<p>Light is setting when you&rsquo;re going to be awake and when</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to be asleep.</p>
<p>When you eat is going to be determining when you&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>be awake and when you&rsquo;re going to be asleep.</p>
<p>And when you eat is also going to be determining when you are</p>
<p>able to clear out debris from your brain and body and repair</p>
<p>the various cells and mechanisms of your body.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re able to reduce those inflammatory cytokines</p>
<p>throughout your body.</p>
<p>And this is really the beauty of time-restricted feeding,</p>
<p>which is it&rsquo;s not really about restricting your feeding.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about accessing the beauty of the fasted state.</p>
<p>Now there are other ways to clear out blood glucose that</p>
<p>involve supplements or prescription drugs.</p>
<p>These are so-called glucose disposal agents,</p>
<p>glucose disposal agents, such as metformin,</p>
<p>which is a prescription drug or berberine,</p>
<p>which is an over-the-counter substance will lead to very</p>
<p>traumatic reductions in blood glucose.</p>
<p>And so they shift you from a fed to a fasted state.</p>
<p>And I know many people who take berberine before eating</p>
<p>meals that include a large number of carbohydrates,</p>
<p>for instance, as a way to clear out glucose.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;ve tried berberine before.</p>
<p>And what I can tell you is that if you take berberine,</p>
<p>which by the way is very much like metformin,</p>
<p>its effects are almost identical to metformin in fact,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s much less expensive and it&rsquo;s over the counter.</p>
<p>If you take berberine and you have not ingested</p>
<p>carbohydrates, many people, including myself,</p>
<p>experience a splitting headache.</p>
<p>You become hypoglycemic because it is a glucose clearing</p>
<p>agent.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re going to experiment with things like metformin</p>
<p>and or berberine or similar,</p>
<p>you want to be very cautious that you&rsquo;re not clearing out</p>
<p>blood glucose that&rsquo;s already low.</p>
<p>And the dose response for this varies tremendously from one</p>
<p>individual to the next.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a strong circadian component.</p>
<p>So some people react very well to berberine early in the day,</p>
<p>but find that later in the day,</p>
<p>it provides extreme headaches for some people it&rsquo;s the</p>
<p>opposite.</p>
<p>So I caution you in exploring things like berberine and</p>
<p>metformin that you should expect to experience a number of</p>
<p>physical and psychological effects that may work for you</p>
<p>might be great for you, but might also not be great for you.</p>
<p>Nowadays, there are a number of commercially available</p>
<p>continuous glucose monitors.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve tried one of these.</p>
<p>It involves putting what&rsquo;s essentially a patch with a little</p>
<p>needle that goes into your skin, which is continuing,</p>
<p>continually, excuse me,</p>
<p>monitoring your blood glucose and you can look at it at an</p>
<p>app on your phone.</p>
<p>And you can learn a lot that way about how different foods</p>
<p>impact the increases and decrease in blood glucose.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re doing experiments with berberine or metformin,</p>
<p>you can see how those impact your blood glucose.</p>
<p>You can see how exercise hit training or otherwise in black</p>
<p>impacts blood glucose, excuse me again,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s very hard to assess blood glucose without a continuous</p>
<p>blood glucose monitor.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re not using one,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re mainly going to be relying on subjective things like,</p>
<p>oh, I feel like I have low blood sugar, or I feel shaky.</p>
<p>Like I have high blood sugar or shaky.</p>
<p>Cause you have low blood sugar.</p>
<p>So I have to say that glucose clearing agents that involve a</p>
<p>walk or exercise moderate or intense are going to be a lot</p>
<p>easier to titrate and adjust the levels of than things that</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to take, where you have to ingest the dosage.</p>
<p>And then once you ingest a certain dosage,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re along for the ride,</p>
<p>at least until the effects of that particular compound</p>
<p>wear off.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t mean those things don&rsquo;t have utility.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t mean people aren&rsquo;t using them because many people</p>
<p>are, but they are potentially a very sharp blade.</p>
<p>That is a double sided blade.</p>
<p>So I encourage you to approach those with caution.</p>
<p>If you decide to at all,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s worth thinking about what the low blood glucose state</p>
<p>is and why it&rsquo;s beneficial as well as why it might produce</p>
<p>headaches.</p>
<p>And in some cases can also adjust the effects of other</p>
<p>hormones in the fasted state,</p>
<p>a number of different proteins that are expressed in cells</p>
<p>undergo changes in their expression.</p>
<p>We talked about this earlier.</p>
<p>When we are fasted,</p>
<p>we tend to reduce the activity of a particular protein</p>
<p>called mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin.</p>
<p>mTOR is very active in cells while they are growing.</p>
<p>So throughout development,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s also very active in cancers of various kinds.</p>
<p>mTOR needs to be what&rsquo;s called phosphorylated.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t know what that means,</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t worry about it.</p>
<p>But phosphorylation is a manner in which certain proteins</p>
<p>are altered so that they can actually be functional within</p>
<p>cells.</p>
<p>mTOR is associated with cell growth of all kinds,</p>
<p>healthy and unhealthy.</p>
<p>When mTOR is phosphorylated,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a marker called PS6.</p>
<p>So phospho mTOR expresses PS6.</p>
<p>If this is all escaping,</p>
<p>you don&rsquo;t worry about it.</p>
<p>Phospho mTOR and PS6 are reduced by fasting.</p>
<p>Now this makes sense if you think about it because eating</p>
<p>and growth are associated with each other.</p>
<p>Fasting is not necessarily anti-growth,</p>
<p>but it is not pro-growth.</p>
<p>And when we fast,</p>
<p>we see increases in cells of things like AMPK,</p>
<p>the sirtuins,</p>
<p>things like transcription factors,</p>
<p>like FOXO, ATF and ketones or ketone bodies.</p>
<p>You may have heard of the ketogenic diet.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the point of all this biochemistry?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just blitz you with a bunch of cellular biology and</p>
<p>biochemistry.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s to say that we have cell growth pathways involving mTOR</p>
<p>and PS6,</p>
<p>and we have cell repair and cell shrinkage processes that</p>
<p>are associated with AMPK,</p>
<p>the so-called sirtuins,</p>
<p>which Dr. David Sinclair from Harvard and others are famous</p>
<p>for discovering and understanding things like AMPK.</p>
<p>These two different divergent pathways of cell growth and</p>
<p>cell breakdown and repair.</p>
<p>And by breakdown,</p>
<p>I mean actual clearance autophagy and repair.</p>
<p>Those can be triggered by being in either the fed or the</p>
<p>fasted state.</p>
<p>So one way I&rsquo;d like you to think about the fed state,</p>
<p>not just eating,</p>
<p>but having recently eaten or the fasted state,</p>
<p>meaning high blood glucose and,</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;ve recently eaten or are currently eating or drinking</p>
<p>calories is that when you eat or when you don&rsquo;t eat,</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re fed,</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re fasted,</p>
<p>you are either promoting cellular growth of all kinds,</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re promoting cellular repair and clearance of all</p>
<p>kinds.</p>
<p>And so again,</p>
<p>this is about setting conditions in the brain and body.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not so much about when you eat food A or B,</p>
<p>it leads to increases in mTOR.</p>
<p>Anytime you eat any food,</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t matter if it&rsquo;s plant-based, animal-based, fat,</p>
<p>protein, carbohydrate, doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>You are biasing your system towards a biochemical state of</p>
<p>cell growth.</p>
<p>And anytime you haven&rsquo;t eaten for a while or blood glucose</p>
<p>is low,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re biasing your system toward a state of cellular repair.</p>
<p>And this is why people who do not suffer from any blood</p>
<p>glucose regulation issues,</p>
<p>take things like Berberine as glucose disposal agents or</p>
<p>take Metformin.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not necessarily suggesting that you do that,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s because those things mimic fasting.</p>
<p>They create situations in the body that promote things like</p>
<p>AMPK and the sirtuins and others to push your body and your</p>
<p>system down a route of repair,</p>
<p>even though you might&rsquo;ve just eaten a meal an hour ago.</p>
<p>Along the lines of the health benefits of intermittent</p>
<p>fasting,</p>
<p>there are nice data showing improvements in the gut</p>
<p>microbiome.</p>
<p>And in particular,</p>
<p>in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome and other forms</p>
<p>of colitis in time-restricted feeding,</p>
<p>meaning time-restricted feeding seems to be able to assist</p>
<p>people with those conditions,</p>
<p>following the general parameters that I discussed before</p>
<p>eight hours and so forth.</p>
<p>Why and how well by way of intermittent fasting impact in</p>
<p>the expression of these various clock genes.</p>
<p>And because the clock genes impact the mucosal lining,</p>
<p>the mucus lining of the gut,</p>
<p>it appears that intermittent fasting can reduce the amount of</p>
<p>so-called lactobacillus that&rsquo;s present in the gut.</p>
<p>And lactobacillus is when in high levels is correlated with</p>
<p>a number of different metabolic disorders.</p>
<p>At the same time,</p>
<p>time-restricted feeding seems to enhance the proliferation of</p>
<p>some of the gut microbiota like a syllobacter and some of</p>
<p>the other ones that promote healthy mucosal lining and that</p>
<p>promote better overall intestinal function.</p>
<p>So these are pathways that have now been established and it</p>
<p>appears that intermittent fasting,</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t just modulating these processes,</p>
<p>but is actually having a direct effect on the mucosal</p>
<p>lining in a way that favors a healthier gut microbiome.</p>
<p>So it should come as no surprise that many people who</p>
<p>experienced gut issues benefit from restricting their</p>
<p>feeding window to eight hours or so per every 24 hour</p>
<p>period.</p>
<p>The other very exciting finding about intermittent fasting</p>
<p>is one of the major health issues these days is the</p>
<p>proliferation of so-called non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.</p>
<p>30 years or so non-alcoholic fatty liver disease was</p>
<p>exceedingly rare to see in the clinic, except in alcoholics.</p>
<p>Fatty deposits in the liver are bad.</p>
<p>It is essentially liver disease.</p>
<p>Nowadays, children and adults are showing up with</p>
<p>non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.</p>
<p>Some of these people are obese, others are not,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s a serious health concern.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s growing in numbers all the time.</p>
<p>A recent study that was published in cell reports medicine</p>
<p>just a couple of weeks ago tested the hypothesis,</p>
<p>whether or not the gut microbiome or so-called brown fat</p>
<p>tissue is impacting the liver health.</p>
<p>And in particular, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.</p>
<p>The short takeaway from the study is that contrary to what</p>
<p>was previously thought the gut microbiome,</p>
<p>while very important for a number of other processes in the</p>
<p>body doesn&rsquo;t seem to be related to this non-alcoholic fatty</p>
<p>liver disease.</p>
<p>This is surprising to people or should be to those of you</p>
<p>that have been following the gut microbiome literature.</p>
<p>However, brown fat,</p>
<p>which is a healthy fat that we have between our two</p>
<p>scapulae and in our upper neck,</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t tend to be blubbery type fat pads,</p>
<p>but it sits deep to the skin,</p>
<p>but creates a thermogenic effect in the body that is helpful</p>
<p>for reducing the amount of other fat,</p>
<p>the type of fat that we&rsquo;re more typically used to thinking</p>
<p>about and talking about white fat and pink fat.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s subcutaneous fat around the abdomen and so forth.</p>
<p>Brown fat seems to have a direct correlation with the lack</p>
<p>of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.</p>
<p>What this study showed was that in people that have</p>
<p>diminished concentrations of brown fat,</p>
<p>there is a higher probability of having non-alcoholic fatty</p>
<p>liver disease.</p>
<p>Now the good news is brown fat stores can be increased.</p>
<p>And again, this isn&rsquo;t going to create blubber of brown fat.</p>
<p>This is going to create increased thermogenesis and actually</p>
<p>make people leaner.</p>
<p>And brown fat has a number of other important positive</p>
<p>effects.</p>
<p>Now this is interesting because cold exposure of anywhere</p>
<p>from one to three minutes,</p>
<p>two or four times per week, or maybe even 10 minutes,</p>
<p>two to four times per week can increase brown fat stores.</p>
<p>Also time-restricted feeding has now been tied to the</p>
<p>density of brown fat stores.</p>
<p>So time-restricted feeding also seems to positively</p>
<p>increase brown fat stores,</p>
<p>probably because of the way that brown fat stores relate to</p>
<p>epinephrine and adrenaline,</p>
<p>which tend to go up when we&rsquo;re fasted.</p>
<p>What does this all mean?</p>
<p>This means for sake of liver health and for sake of reducing</p>
<p>or maybe preventing, or even potentially,</p>
<p>want to underline potentially reversing non-alcoholic fatty</p>
<p>liver disease,</p>
<p>time-restricted feeding also appears to be beneficial.</p>
<p>Many people out there are interested in optimizing their</p>
<p>hormones.</p>
<p>And as we mentioned earlier,</p>
<p>insulin is a hormone and time-restricted feeding seems to</p>
<p>have very positive effects on overall insulin profiles and</p>
<p>so forth.</p>
<p>But anytime you mentioned hormones,</p>
<p>people immediately seem to leap to the sex steroid hormones,</p>
<p>testosterone and estrogen,</p>
<p>because indeed they have powerful effects,</p>
<p>both in the short-term and the long-term in terms of our</p>
<p>mental and physical health and performance.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s at least one study that&rsquo;s explored the effects of</p>
<p>time-restricted eating on performance,</p>
<p>athletic performance, immune function, and body composition.</p>
<p>This was a study by Morrow et al that was performed on</p>
<p>elite cyclists.</p>
<p>So I want to point that out.</p>
<p>It was a randomized control trial,</p>
<p>but what&rsquo;s really nice about this study is that it explored</p>
<p>a number of different hormonal parameters in people that</p>
<p>were using time-restricted eating or that had a more</p>
<p>extended eating window.</p>
<p>And they tracked everything very carefully.</p>
<p>And the amount of food they were eating was actually pretty</p>
<p>considerable, 4,800 calories.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a lot of calories, but then again,</p>
<p>they were very active and they measured a number of different</p>
<p>things related to VO2 max, et cetera,</p>
<p>performance and overall performance at what they did,</p>
<p>cycling is not the point that I want to emphasize here.</p>
<p>Although there were some positive effects on their</p>
<p>performance related to time-restricted eating.</p>
<p>The point I want to talk about relates to things that</p>
<p>presumably relate to most everybody,</p>
<p>which are the effects on things like glucose,</p>
<p>thyroid hormone, testosterone, sex hormone,</p>
<p>binding globulin,</p>
<p>which can bind up testosterone and prevent the so-called</p>
<p>free form of testosterone,</p>
<p>which is the one that has most of the actions in the brain</p>
<p>and body.</p>
<p>And the major takeaway from this study was that time</p>
<p>restricted feeding of the same amount of calories as the so</p>
<p>called control condition, okay.</p>
<p>Same calories,</p>
<p>but either compact throughout the 24 hour cycle to an eight</p>
<p>hour feeding window or allowing them to eat over a larger</p>
<p>feeding window did lead to significant decreases in free</p>
<p>testosterone.</p>
<p>And I think a number of people will raise their eyebrows to</p>
<p>that and think, oh,</p>
<p>well then maybe time-restricted feeding is not for me.</p>
<p>There are a number of important considerations.</p>
<p>Of course,</p>
<p>one is while the decrease in free testosterone was</p>
<p>significant,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s also going to depend on where people start out.</p>
<p>So if somebody has already low or modest levels of</p>
<p>testosterone and it drops by 10 or 20%,</p>
<p>that could lead them into a state of poor performance and</p>
<p>wellbeing.</p>
<p>Whereas if somebody has higher testosterone,</p>
<p>a decrease won&rsquo;t necessarily do that.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s important to take that into consideration.</p>
<p>This is why I&rsquo;m always such a fan of people doing their</p>
<p>blood work and knowing what&rsquo;s going on under the hood for</p>
<p>them.</p>
<p>A very interesting change in hormonal profile was cortisol,</p>
<p>so-called stress hormone.</p>
<p>Cortisol of course is also naturally released early in the</p>
<p>day in a healthy way to wake you up and promote alertness,</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t want its levels to be too high or to have</p>
<p>peaks in cortisol late in the day.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually correlated with depression and a number of</p>
<p>other untoward things.</p>
<p>I would have thought that by restricting a feeding window to</p>
<p>a particular time each day that these hard training</p>
<p>cyclists would have undergone increases in serum cortisol.</p>
<p>And in fact, the opposite was true.</p>
<p>They had significant reductions in serum cortisol as a</p>
<p>consequence of time restricted feeding.</p>
<p>I should mention there were significant reductions in serum</p>
<p>cortisol also in the control group,</p>
<p>but not to the same extent.</p>
<p>And the two groups did differ significantly from one</p>
<p>another.</p>
<p>Now this is important because if you just look at one</p>
<p>hormone testosterone, you&rsquo;d say, okay,</p>
<p>based on these data,</p>
<p>time restricted feeding is reducing testosterone levels</p>
<p>significantly,</p>
<p>even though the number of calories is quite high and is held</p>
<p>constant across the study.</p>
<p>But in fact, because cortisol is lower,</p>
<p>it may mean that the effects of testosterone or the</p>
<p>reduction in testosterone is offset.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because cortisol and testosterone are always in</p>
<p>this somewhat of a dance in terms of cortisol,</p>
<p>inhibiting the effects of testosterone largely and vice</p>
<p>versa.</p>
<p>So it is interesting and important to look at the total</p>
<p>gallery of hormones.</p>
<p>And they did look at a number of hormones.</p>
<p>They looked at other inflammatory markers.</p>
<p>Those were not increased.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not surprising.</p>
<p>If you remember back to the 2012 Sachin Panda study,</p>
<p>this early pioneering study on time,</p>
<p>restricted feeding,</p>
<p>they saw reductions in stress hormones and in inflammatory</p>
<p>markers in time, restricted feeding mice.</p>
<p>And here, this also seems to be the case in humans.</p>
<p>So the takeaway is for sake of hormone health,</p>
<p>time restricted feeding is compatible with quality hormone</p>
<p>health, even in high-performing athletes,</p>
<p>based on everything we know and that we&rsquo;ve discussed,</p>
<p>I would not suggest that people restrict their feeding</p>
<p>window to less than eight hours,</p>
<p>especially if they&rsquo;re training hard on a regular basis.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not just athletes that should pay attention to</p>
<p>this.</p>
<p>When we are working very hard,</p>
<p>when we are psychologically stressed,</p>
<p>when we are studying for exams or we are in conflict with</p>
<p>somebody on a regular basis,</p>
<p>that creates a stress in the body.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s very similar to that of physical training,</p>
<p>the body and brain don&rsquo;t distinguish between physical stress</p>
<p>and mental stress.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all nervous system.</p>
<p>Remember that it&rsquo;s just cortisol and adrenaline.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no special hormone just for physical stress versus</p>
<p>psychological stress.</p>
<p>So again,</p>
<p>in thinking about what sort of feeding window will be right</p>
<p>for you,</p>
<p>I would look back at this eight hour time bin that seems</p>
<p>more or less flexible for most conditions,</p>
<p>even high-performing elite athletes.</p>
<p>And I would say just by logical extension,</p>
<p>even for people that have a lot of stress in their life.</p>
<p>And I personally wouldn&rsquo;t suggest that people who have a lot</p>
<p>of stress in their life or the potential for stress in their</p>
<p>life, shorten their feeding window,</p>
<p>much shorter than eight hours,</p>
<p>because then you would expect that you would start to</p>
<p>increase some of the inflammatory markers.</p>
<p>You would increase the stress hormones and you would be</p>
<p>decreasing things like testosterone and estrogen,</p>
<p>some of the sex steroid hormones.</p>
<p>So again, it&rsquo;s all about context and the eight hour window,</p>
<p>it isn&rsquo;t holy,</p>
<p>but seems to be a really useful guide to extract the great</p>
<p>health benefits of which there are many in of which we&rsquo;ve</p>
<p>discussed from intermittent fasting,</p>
<p>time-restricted feeding,</p>
<p>and yet that it could still be compatible with decent social</p>
<p>schedules and for maintaining hormone health.</p>
<p>In keeping with this for women that are trying to maintain</p>
<p>ovulatory cycles or for couples that are trying to get</p>
<p>pregnant,</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s also important to not create a feeding window</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s too short.</p>
<p>The relationship between feeding and body fat stores and</p>
<p>glucose and leptin and hormones is a well-established one.</p>
<p>And we can summarize it very easily here.</p>
<p>Although I&rsquo;ve done several episodes related to this</p>
<p>previously on optimizing hormone health,</p>
<p>but basically we undergo puberty when there&rsquo;s enough food</p>
<p>and there&rsquo;s enough body fat that the body fat sends a signal</p>
<p>to the brain called leptin.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a hormone that comes from body fat signals to the</p>
<p>brain to turn on puberty that&rsquo;s puberty.</p>
<p>But even as adults for women that are menstruating,</p>
<p>there needs to be sufficient leptin signaling to the brain in</p>
<p>order to maintain ovulation because of the way that the brain</p>
<p>communicates with the pituitary and the ovaries.</p>
<p>Similarly for men fasting or extreme exercise plus fasting,</p>
<p>we now know reduces testosterone.</p>
<p>Its impacts are not exactly clear.</p>
<p>However, if you reduce food intake,</p>
<p>either in total calories or in duration too much,</p>
<p>you will suffer a drop in sperm counts.</p>
<p>Fertility will drop.</p>
<p>And this makes sense.</p>
<p>The body is communicating to the brain,</p>
<p>whether or not conditions are sufficient in the body to</p>
<p>reproduce and to presumably,</p>
<p>and hopefully support the health and wellbeing of those</p>
<p>offspring.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a logical link between body fat and eating and</p>
<p>how much food is available to you and how long it&rsquo;s</p>
<p>available to you and the signals in the brain that allow for</p>
<p>reproductive success.</p>
<p>There are some data that point to differences in the effects</p>
<p>of intermittent fasting for males versus females.</p>
<p>Those data right now only come from mice.</p>
<p>That study was published by Sachin Panda recently.</p>
<p>We still await the studies in humans.</p>
<p>Some people do not do well on intermittent fasting,</p>
<p>either in terms of mood or hormone health.</p>
<p>And so everyone needs to determine for themselves,</p>
<p>whether or not having a time-restricted feeding window is</p>
<p>good for them.</p>
<p>How long that time-restricted feeding window should be.</p>
<p>I think eight hours is kind of a nice minimum to adhere to</p>
<p>based on everything that we&rsquo;ve covered today.</p>
<p>And for some people time-restricted feeding is not going to</p>
<p>be compatible with hormone health for them,</p>
<p>eating more meals spread throughout the day,</p>
<p>presumably smaller meals,</p>
<p>same caloric intake is going to be more beneficial for</p>
<p>their hormones.</p>
<p>This is something that is going to be individual and is</p>
<p>going to have to be determined on an individual basis.</p>
<p>However, if you&rsquo;re going to try time-restricted feeding,</p>
<p>I do want to remind you that taking a period of three to</p>
<p>seven or ideally 10 days to transition into it,</p>
<p>not just going flipping from eating to three meals a day</p>
<p>that span from 6am to 10pm and suddenly going to an eight</p>
<p>hour feeding window,</p>
<p>but rather winnowing down that feeding window about an hour</p>
<p>or so per day is going to allow the hormone systems of your</p>
<p>body, including leptin, the hypocretin erection system,</p>
<p>which are systems within the body that signal to the brain</p>
<p>that food is about to come,</p>
<p>allowing those systems to adjust so that you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>overwhelmingly hungry, irritable,</p>
<p>and you&rsquo;re not throwing your whole hormone system out of</p>
<p>whack.</p>
<p>I keep coming back to this eight hour feeding window and I</p>
<p>want to provide a little more basis for it.</p>
<p>And just to encourage that it&rsquo;s not completely arbitrary,</p>
<p>the lengthy review that I mentioned earlier features a</p>
<p>number of studies that have used this eight hour feeding</p>
<p>window,</p>
<p>but there&rsquo;s a particular study that I&rsquo;d like to highlight</p>
<p>mainly because I don&rsquo;t expect people to delve into the full</p>
<p>reference list of the other review.</p>
<p>And this is a study that was carried out between such in</p>
<p>Panda&rsquo;s lab and Christopherities labs.</p>
<p>This is a collaboration.</p>
<p>The study was carried out in humans and is entitled effects</p>
<p>of eight hour time,</p>
<p>restricted feeding on body weight and metabolic disease,</p>
<p>risk factors in obese adults, excuse me.</p>
<p>And this study essentially showed,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just read the conclusions that an eight hour time</p>
<p>restricted feeding produces a mild caloric restriction and</p>
<p>weight loss without calorie counting.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s key, right?</p>
<p>These people aren&rsquo;t calorie counting somehow just by</p>
<p>adhering to an eight hour window,</p>
<p>they are taking in fewer calories than they&rsquo;re burning off</p>
<p>and clinically it reduced blood pressure.</p>
<p>So I mentioned the study,</p>
<p>not because there aren&rsquo;t many others involving the eight</p>
<p>hour feeding window also in humans,</p>
<p>but because the eight hour feeding window has been tested in</p>
<p>obese adults and non-obese adults.</p>
<p>And there are even a few studies in children.</p>
<p>So this eight hour window seems to be a really good rule of</p>
<p>thumb and a kind of anchor around which we can each think</p>
<p>about incorporating time restricted feeding.</p>
<p>There are of course other patterns of feeding.</p>
<p>And while some people have engaged in longer fasts of 24</p>
<p>hours, 36 hours or more alternate day fasting,</p>
<p>meaning eating one day, not eating the next day,</p>
<p>or in some cases eating one day and eating very few</p>
<p>calories, 500 or 600 calories.</p>
<p>The next day has been tested.</p>
<p>A few studies have also looked at eating a sort of</p>
<p>maintenance level of calories for five days and then taking</p>
<p>two days and fasting clear through or eating very few</p>
<p>calories, you know, 300 or 500 calories.</p>
<p>In fact, there&rsquo;s a sort of a community online of people that</p>
<p>are exploring longer fast for sake of trying to offset</p>
<p>dementia or reverse effects of dementia.</p>
<p>Thus far, at least in my awareness,</p>
<p>there isn&rsquo;t any quality clinical peer reviewed study on that</p>
<p>yet for sake of dementia.</p>
<p>Although I await those studies.</p>
<p>And if anyone&rsquo;s aware of them,</p>
<p>please send me a link in the comments,</p>
<p>but alternate day fasting has gotten the so-called safe bill</p>
<p>of health.</p>
<p>This has been written up,</p>
<p>meaning that people didn&rsquo;t suffer bone loss.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t suffer any major detrimental effects.</p>
<p>It does seem that it can create significant weight loss and</p>
<p>can help with obese individuals that it can reduce resting</p>
<p>blood glucose.</p>
<p>And every other day fasting in many cases can produce more</p>
<p>rapid effects on weight loss and reductions in blood glucose</p>
<p>than time restricted feeding.</p>
<p>However, every other day type fasting for most people is not</p>
<p>going to be feasible.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just not going to be able to do that for a long</p>
<p>period of time.</p>
<p>And what hasn&rsquo;t really been done is the follow-up to see</p>
<p>whether or not people who do every other day fasting or five</p>
<p>days of eating followed by two days of fasting,</p>
<p>whether or not that leads to a rebound in weight gain,</p>
<p>whether or not that leads to a rebound in blood glucose,</p>
<p>et cetera.</p>
<p>So for now the eight hour feeding window and time</p>
<p>restricted feeding seems to be the most tested supported in</p>
<p>animal studies and in human studies.</p>
<p>And the one around which I think most people should orient</p>
<p>if they&rsquo;re considering getting into time restricted feeding.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also sort of hard to imagine how one could include a</p>
<p>significant exercise schedule or work schedule on every other</p>
<p>day fasting.</p>
<p>Remember in any study,</p>
<p>people are often being compensated or at least are</p>
<p>incentivized in some way to adhere to the study.</p>
<p>This is one of the major issues that I have with any study</p>
<p>that says that three or four different diets are essentially</p>
<p>equal in terms of their ability to produce weight loss.</p>
<p>Adherence is very different in the outside world where you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have a researcher monitoring you where you&rsquo;re not</p>
<p>logging all your food.</p>
<p>Most people don&rsquo;t do that consistently.</p>
<p>And we can take a little bit of a neuroscience perspective</p>
<p>on this to try and arrive at what the best kind of</p>
<p>organization of eating plan,</p>
<p>or if we wanted to call it a diet,</p>
<p>we could would be for you.</p>
<p>Many people find it easier to just not eat for certain</p>
<p>periods of each 24 hour cycle than to eat smaller portions.</p>
<p>Portion control is very hard for some people,</p>
<p>for other people it&rsquo;s manageable, but people like me,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t eat half the croissant.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a real thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not, it&rsquo;s not available to me.</p>
<p>I should say now, of course I could eat just half a</p>
<p>croissant, but I noticed that when I eat the croissant,</p>
<p>because they&rsquo;re so delicious that it creates a rise in blood</p>
<p>glucose, a rise in the other hormones and chemicals that are</p>
<p>associated with ingesting delicious, highly palatable food.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s actually a lot of work for me to just eat half the</p>
<p>croissant.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s much more thoroughly satisfying</p>
<p>about eating the entire croissant.</p>
<p>And actually there&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s somewhat satisfying</p>
<p>about not eating the croissant at all.</p>
<p>And just knowing that later I can eat the whole croissant.</p>
<p>Now that&rsquo;s me.</p>
<p>Other people find that they don&rsquo;t have any trouble with</p>
<p>portion control,</p>
<p>that for them just eating small bits of food throughout the</p>
<p>day is what sets them in the right psychological and</p>
<p>physical state for sake of work, et cetera.</p>
<p>And I mentioned work and mental focus because one of the</p>
<p>aspects of fasting that have drawn a lot of people to time</p>
<p>restricted feeding and fasting is the clarity of mind that</p>
<p>people get when, first of all,</p>
<p>they don&rsquo;t have to think about when they&rsquo;re going to eat</p>
<p>because they know when their eating window begins.</p>
<p>They also don&rsquo;t have to think about regulating their</p>
<p>behavior because they already know when they&rsquo;re going to eat</p>
<p>and when they&rsquo;re not going to eat.</p>
<p>Whereas when you&rsquo;re restricting portions,</p>
<p>you actually have to make decisions all the while, you know,</p>
<p>and I think I, like many people decide, well, you know,</p>
<p>is that exactly half or could I have like another rung on</p>
<p>the croissant, this kind of thing.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t negotiate with food.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I like a time restricted feeding window.</p>
<p>I know I&rsquo;m going to eat for, in my case,</p>
<p>I use a 10 hour feeding window or so,</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;ll eat the whole croissant.</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t have to think about it.</p>
<p>Now the food choices that you make inside of that feeding</p>
<p>window are of course also going to be very important.</p>
<p>Certain foods will increase blood glucose such that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to get hungrier and hungrier.</p>
<p>Others will maintain lower blood glucose and will allow you</p>
<p>to be more controlled in the foods that you pursue.</p>
<p>Those are all individual considerations that are deserving of</p>
<p>their own entire episode.</p>
<p>But I do want to point out that the advantage of time</p>
<p>restricted feeding is that it involves a lot of the</p>
<p>decision-making in the brain.</p>
<p>The so-called go, no-go circuitries of our basal ganglia.</p>
<p>If you want to know this areas that control them,</p>
<p>anytime we have to restrict a behavior,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s called a no-go.</p>
<p>Anytime we engage in a behavior, that&rsquo;s a go.</p>
<p>No-go behaviors require a lot of what&rsquo;s called top-down</p>
<p>control, and it&rsquo;s very metabolically demanding.</p>
<p>And so time restricted feeding allows you to depart from the</p>
<p>whole no-go, go negotiation that you have to undergo when</p>
<p>you have to restrict portions.</p>
<p>And so I think this is a reason why many people have</p>
<p>gravitated towards time restricted feeding and why,</p>
<p>for people that don&rsquo;t want to have to think about all that,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s just very straightforward.</p>
<p>One of the more hot button issues out there is whether or</p>
<p>not given equal amounts of caloric intake and equal amounts</p>
<p>of activity and equal amounts of nutrients, et cetera,</p>
<p>whether or not restricting food to a particular window</p>
<p>biases more weight loss toward fat loss versus loss of</p>
<p>other tissues.</p>
<p>Because of course, when we lose weight,</p>
<p>we can lose that from any number of different storage sites</p>
<p>within the body, muscle, water, glycogen, or fat.</p>
<p>Now this is such a hot button issue that I almost don&rsquo;t want</p>
<p>to get into it, but I&rsquo;m going to get into it anyway,</p>
<p>because there are data that are very interesting.</p>
<p>This is covered in the review that I mentioned earlier that</p>
<p>describes how if people follow a time restricted feeding</p>
<p>schedule for long periods of time, so 60 days or longer,</p>
<p>there are some metabolic changes in the way that people</p>
<p>metabolize energy that do seem to shift the system toward</p>
<p>more fat loss relative to burning of other tissues when in a</p>
<p>state of caloric restriction.</p>
<p>And I want to say when in a state of caloric restriction,</p>
<p>because there&rsquo;s really no way to cheat the system.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no way that you can ingest far more calories than</p>
<p>you burn or excrete.</p>
<p>When I say excrete, you know,</p>
<p>I certainly don&rsquo;t suggest this, but there, you know,</p>
<p>bulimics and other people that have eating disorders will</p>
<p>use laxatives as a way to eliminate food quickly from their</p>
<p>system so it can&rsquo;t be converted into fat or other forms of</p>
<p>energy.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a very, in that case, it&rsquo;s a pathological situation,</p>
<p>but in general calories in versus calories out,</p>
<p>as I mentioned earlier,</p>
<p>is this kind of foundational element,</p>
<p>but in states of caloric restriction,</p>
<p>meaning sub-maintenance intake,</p>
<p>time-restricted feeding does seem to bias more of the energy</p>
<p>burned to compensate for that deficit from fat.</p>
<p>And the way it accomplishes it is very interesting.</p>
<p>It turns out that it drives more fat loss by way of</p>
<p>increasing a hepatic lipase.</p>
<p>This is something called LIPC,</p>
<p>hepatic means of the liver and lipase,</p>
<p>which anytime you hear ASE is means it&rsquo;s an enzyme.</p>
<p>So it seems to increase hepatic lipase.</p>
<p>So it increases the enzyme that metabolizes fat for</p>
<p>lipolysis and energy production and reduces something called</p>
<p>CIDEC, C I D E C,</p>
<p>which is a lipid droplet associated and lipolysis</p>
<p>inhibitor. Now that&rsquo;s a mouthful, no pun intended,</p>
<p>but what CIDEC really is this lipid droplet associated</p>
<p>molecule is it can inhibit lipolysis.</p>
<p>So extended periods of time-restricted feeding,</p>
<p>meaning eight hour feeding window or 10 hour feeding window</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s obeyed for several months or more seems to allow the</p>
<p>system to shift toward burning more fat or rather using a</p>
<p>higher percentage of fat when in a caloric deficit.</p>
<p>Now I doubt that this is going to resolve the truly barbed</p>
<p>wire, almost hairball,</p>
<p>ridiculous online debates about whether or not time</p>
<p>restricted feeding is better than another feeding schedule.</p>
<p>Look, I don&rsquo;t think any particular feeding schedule is holy.</p>
<p>If you are sub caloric,</p>
<p>meaning fewer calories burned than calories ingested,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re going to lose weight.</p>
<p>But the data seem to point to the fact that if you do time</p>
<p>restricted feeding for a fairly long duration of time,</p>
<p>and you maintain that,</p>
<p>that you are increasing these lipases that increase</p>
<p>lipolysis energy use from fat,</p>
<p>and you are decreasing the lipid droplet associated</p>
<p>lipolysis inhibitors.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s both a,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re removing the brake and you&rsquo;re pressing on the</p>
<p>accelerator of fat loss.</p>
<p>I think that this logically points to a case in which using</p>
<p>time-restricted feeding with a sub caloric intake seems to</p>
<p>be at least to my mind,</p>
<p>the most scientifically supported way to ensure that a</p>
<p>significant portion of the weight that one loses is from</p>
<p>body fat stores.</p>
<p>Any discussion about fasting would be incomplete without a</p>
<p>discussion about what does and does not break a fast.</p>
<p>However,</p>
<p>there is no black and white answer to that question.</p>
<p>And you should immediately understand why it&rsquo;s because</p>
<p>eating and not eating are not equivalent to fed and fasted.</p>
<p>It depends on when you ate,</p>
<p>how much you ate and where you are in your circadian cycle.</p>
<p>We can actually arrive at a simple answer to whether or not</p>
<p>something breaks the fast or not.</p>
<p>Now,</p>
<p>the technical way to go about this would be to wear a</p>
<p>continuous glucose monitor and to ingest little bits of food</p>
<p>of different kinds or large amounts of food of different</p>
<p>kinds and measure blood glucose,</p>
<p>because ultimately blood glucose is the readout of whether</p>
<p>or not your system is in a fed or fasted state.</p>
<p>There are other parameters too, of course,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s the dominant one.</p>
<p>Insofar as the scientific literature says,</p>
<p>drinking water will not break your fast.</p>
<p>Drinking tea will not break your fast.</p>
<p>Drinking coffee provided it is black coffee will not break</p>
<p>your fast.</p>
<p>Ingesting caffeine in pill form will not break your fast.</p>
<p>There are other things that won&rsquo;t break your fast.</p>
<p>For instance,</p>
<p>eating one peanut when deep in a fasted state will not break</p>
<p>your fast.</p>
<p>Eating a whole handful of peanuts might not even break your</p>
<p>fast if you are in a very low glucose state.</p>
<p>However,</p>
<p>if you just finished a meal that included carbohydrates or</p>
<p>it was a very large meal of any kind an hour ago, yes,</p>
<p>indeed eating one peanut could break your fast.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s all contextual.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s really important to understand unless you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to wear a continuous glucose monitor.</p>
<p>And unless you&rsquo;re going to wear a continuous glucose</p>
<p>monitor and set an absolute numerical threshold for what it</p>
<p>is to break your fast.</p>
<p>I think there are some simple rules that we can follow.</p>
<p>First of all,</p>
<p>anything that involves sugar in particular,</p>
<p>simple sugars can potentially break your fast.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s actually a study on this,</p>
<p>which shows that if people ingest even one,</p>
<p>one gram of sugar post dinner,</p>
<p>if they had a full meal for dinner,</p>
<p>that can actually disrupt the expression of some of the</p>
<p>circadian genes related to fasting and to sleep and sleep</p>
<p>related fasting.</p>
<p>Now that&rsquo;s pretty extreme.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost kind of scary to think about,</p>
<p>but that&rsquo;s how sensitive our system is.</p>
<p>If we already have somewhat elevated blood glucose from a</p>
<p>meal that we ate an hour or so ago,</p>
<p>whereas if we have run for an hour or trained hard,</p>
<p>high intensity training,</p>
<p>and we haven&rsquo;t quite reached the beginning of our so-called</p>
<p>feeding window,</p>
<p>will eating a small amount of food take us out of that fast?</p>
<p>Well, depends on what the food is.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s mostly fat, probably not.</p>
<p>A number of people out there nowadays talk about so-called</p>
<p>fat fasting.</p>
<p>Fat fasting is a way to kind of regal past the stringency of</p>
<p>either eating or not eating as a black and white rule for</p>
<p>feeding window versus non-feeding window.</p>
<p>So some people will ingest medium chain triglycerides,</p>
<p>so-called MCTs,</p>
<p>or people will ingest fats only until their official</p>
<p>feeding window begins.</p>
<p>So these are sort of how the negotiations that people carry</p>
<p>out tend to go.</p>
<p>But fat of course,</p>
<p>won&rsquo;t increase blood glucose and insulin as much as</p>
<p>carbohydrates will.</p>
<p>Protein will have sort of an intermediate effect.</p>
<p>And as I mentioned earlier,</p>
<p>ingesting carbohydrates with some fat will tend to blunt the</p>
<p>rise in glucose and will extend the duration over which</p>
<p>glucose is released.</p>
<p>So we really can&rsquo;t say food X or beverage X breaks a fast.</p>
<p>However, at the extremes, we can say that, for instance,</p>
<p>if you drink a can of soda pop,</p>
<p>unless you just ran an ultra marathon,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re breaking your fast.</p>
<p>Okay. Eat a piece of pizza.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re breaking your fast.</p>
<p>If you eat purely fats, maybe, probably not.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve been fasting for five hours or more,</p>
<p>strictly fasting for five hours or more.</p>
<p>So you can start to see where there&rsquo;s a lot of wiggle room</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s very contextual.</p>
<p>And this is why any posts that you see,</p>
<p>or any information that you see that something does or does</p>
<p>not break your fast,</p>
<p>that doesn&rsquo;t place it in the context of when the last time</p>
<p>you ate and what you ate and your activity and your time</p>
<p>within the circadian clock schedule of 24 hours.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a sort of meaningless discussion.</p>
<p>So in general,</p>
<p>I think what&rsquo;s really useful if you&rsquo;re not going to wear a</p>
<p>continuous glucose monitor is to try and be fairly strict</p>
<p>about when you initiate your feeding window.</p>
<p>And when you stop your feeding window,</p>
<p>and as time evolves and you establish a more regular routine</p>
<p>of eating certain kinds of foods and not others that are</p>
<p>right for you.</p>
<p>Cause as I&rsquo;ve emphasized before on this podcast,</p>
<p>and I will continue to emphasize,</p>
<p>keto works great for some people.</p>
<p>Vegetarian keto works great for some people.</p>
<p>Carnivore diet works great for other people.</p>
<p>Some people are omnivores.</p>
<p>Some people are carnivores.</p>
<p>Some people are vegan.</p>
<p>All of that is great and fine by me.</p>
<p>Everyone has to establish what&rsquo;s right for them today.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve really bypassed the discussion about foods of a</p>
<p>particular origin or type animal-based or plant-based,</p>
<p>but all the same rules apply within this thing that we&rsquo;re</p>
<p>called intermittent fasting or time-restricted feeding.</p>
<p>So what breaks a fast will depend and what you want to eat</p>
<p>or what you are willing to eat.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a totally separate manner from when you eat.</p>
<p>But as we&rsquo;ve established, when you eat is vitally important.</p>
<p>Some of you are probably wondering whether or not artificial</p>
<p>sweeteners or non-artificial plant-based sweeteners like</p>
<p>Stevia break a fast.</p>
<p>This will vary somewhat.</p>
<p>And I have to say the data on this are somewhat mixed.</p>
<p>There is evidence that when people ingest artificial</p>
<p>sweeteners,</p>
<p>that it can create a transient increase in blood glucose</p>
<p>followed by a transient decrease in blood glucose below</p>
<p>baseline.</p>
<p>This is thought to explain the increase in hunger caused by</p>
<p>ingestion of things like aspartame and sucralose and things</p>
<p>of that sort.</p>
<p>There are not a lot of good studies exploring the plant</p>
<p>based non-sugar sweeteners, things like Stevia,</p>
<p>even things like monk fruit,</p>
<p>which is a separate category into itself.</p>
<p>There aren&rsquo;t a lot of studies on this.</p>
<p>I think most people need to establish this for themselves.</p>
<p>The best way of course,</p>
<p>would be to wear a continuous glucose monitor to go into a</p>
<p>fasted state of either one hour or two hours,</p>
<p>or maybe you&rsquo;ve been fasting all night and then ingest</p>
<p>Stevia in whatever form you want or coffee in whatever form</p>
<p>you want with sucralose or aspartame, et cetera,</p>
<p>setting aside the discussion about the effects of these</p>
<p>things on the gut microbiome,</p>
<p>which is a different topic entirely.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s fair to say that in moderation,</p>
<p>the plant-based non-sugar sweeteners like Stevia in</p>
<p>particular Stevia seem to have a minimal impact on overall</p>
<p>blood glucose when considered over a fairly large time bin</p>
<p>aspartame and sucralose, saccharin,</p>
<p>I think we can say more or less the same,</p>
<p>but as soon as you get into a discussion about those,</p>
<p>you also have to get into a discussion about some of the</p>
<p>evidence published in nature and other excellent journals</p>
<p>now pointing to the fact that when consumed in excess,</p>
<p>not when consumed in moderation,</p>
<p>but when consumed in excess that those might have some</p>
<p>detrimental effects on the gut microbiome.</p>
<p>So do artificial sweeteners break a fast depends on the</p>
<p>amount depends on the type. And in general,</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re probably okay,</p>
<p>provided that you&rsquo;re not indulging in them too often.</p>
<p>However, some people,</p>
<p>just by virtue of tasting something sweet,</p>
<p>feel a spike in their appetite that makes it harder for them</p>
<p>to adhere to the feeding window.</p>
<p>And so this is why you can imagine that a really well</p>
<p>controlled study on this would be very hard to carry out.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not really sure that it&rsquo;s worth our tax dollars to</p>
<p>actually design and carry out a study like that,</p>
<p>because there would be so much individual variation in terms</p>
<p>of discipline in adhering to the feeding window,</p>
<p>whether or not people experience increases and drops in</p>
<p>blood glucose, how that impacts them,</p>
<p>whether or not they&rsquo;re exercising,</p>
<p>it just becomes an infinite variable space, as we say,</p>
<p>in experimental science.</p>
<p>So you really have to determine that for you,</p>
<p>but I don&rsquo;t think that we can fairly say that artificial</p>
<p>sweeteners break a fast.</p>
<p>I think that would be incorrect to say earlier,</p>
<p>we were talking about glucose disposal agents,</p>
<p>both behavioral and compound based things like metformin and</p>
<p>berberine. And in fact,</p>
<p>cinnamon is even a mild glucose disposal agent.</p>
<p>It can actually reduce blood glucose,</p>
<p>lemon and lime juice, believe it or not,</p>
<p>can lower blood glucose.</p>
<p>You may have experienced this before of eating something</p>
<p>very, very sweet and almost feeling kind of overwhelmed and</p>
<p>kind of poisoned by how sweet it is,</p>
<p>especially if you&rsquo;re not accustomed to eating a lot of</p>
<p>sugary things.</p>
<p>One quick remedy for that is actually a half lime or a half</p>
<p>lemon squeezed into juice and drinking that just by virtue</p>
<p>of the taste and by virtue of the fact that it will reduce</p>
<p>blood glucose,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll notice that that effect almost immediately</p>
<p>disappears. That&rsquo;s not magic.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the effects of acidity on blood glucose levels.</p>
<p>So there are a number of things that can adjust blood</p>
<p>glucose. They&rsquo;re not necessarily disposal agents.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not sweeping it out of the bloodstream in the same</p>
<p>way that berberine or metformin would,</p>
<p>or that high intensity exercise at the appropriate times of</p>
<p>day would,</p>
<p>but there is one particular thing that one can ingest that</p>
<p>can help manage psychologically and performance wise through</p>
<p>the fasting portion of the intermittent fasting and get you</p>
<p>to your feeding window. And that&rsquo;s salt.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked a little bit about this on the podcast before,</p>
<p>but because neurons use salt, sodium and potassium,</p>
<p>and magnesium,</p>
<p>the so-called electrolytes in order to perform their magic</p>
<p>of chemical and electrical signaling,</p>
<p>everything you do depends on chemical and electrical</p>
<p>signaling and all that chemical and electrical signaling</p>
<p>requires electrolytes in some form or another neurons run on</p>
<p>the passage of ions like sodium in and out of their cell</p>
<p>membranes, or I should say across their cell membranes,</p>
<p>to be accurate.</p>
<p>Many people find that the kind of lightheadedness,</p>
<p>the shakiness that&rsquo;s accustomed with having slightly low</p>
<p>blood sugar can be offset by taking a half teaspoon or so of</p>
<p>sea salt,</p>
<p>or even just a tiny pinch of salt and putting into some</p>
<p>water and drinking it.</p>
<p>Some people find because of the glucose lowering effects of</p>
<p>acidity,</p>
<p>that if they&rsquo;re feeling kind of shaky and not well,</p>
<p>and they put some lemon juice into water and drink that it</p>
<p>drops their blood glucose further.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s a common practice nowadays that&rsquo;s discussed on</p>
<p>the internet of waking up,</p>
<p>drinking some water with some lime or lemon juice in it with</p>
<p>a little pinch of salt.</p>
<p>I think that little pinch of salt is a good idea.</p>
<p>What is it doing?</p>
<p>How is it offsetting all this?</p>
<p>Well, salt water actually has a mild effect as a glucose</p>
<p>disposal agent,</p>
<p>but it has a stabilizing effect on blood volume.</p>
<p>And so because sodium brings with it water and the so-called</p>
<p>osmolarity of your blood and your body depends on the salt</p>
<p>levels in your blood and brain and body.</p>
<p>Many people find that if they&rsquo;re feeling shaky,</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re feeling lightheaded.</p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t concentrate.</p>
<p>They think they need sugar or food,</p>
<p>but what will actually remedy that is some salt.</p>
<p>And I know a number of people that have incorporated this</p>
<p>practice and have written to me and saying, oh, you know,</p>
<p>if I just take a little bit of salt and some water,</p>
<p>they may or may not include the lemon or lime juice.</p>
<p>They immediately feel better and find that it&rsquo;s actually</p>
<p>quite straightforward to get out to that,</p>
<p>to wait until the feeding window kicks in.</p>
<p>This is especially true for people that are using caffeine</p>
<p>because when you ingest caffeine,</p>
<p>you actually excrete a lot of water has a diuretic effect.</p>
<p>And with that water goes salt.</p>
<p>So it actually causes you to excrete sodium.</p>
<p>Now the role of sodium in blood pressure and hypertension is,</p>
<p>you know, quite controversial science magazine,</p>
<p>one of the premier scientific journals out there had a</p>
<p>special issue all about salt some years ago,</p>
<p>talking about the research around hypertension, indeed,</p>
<p>people with chronic hypertension or high blood pressure or</p>
<p>very high blood pressure in particular should be wary of</p>
<p>ingesting too much sodium.</p>
<p>But for most people ingesting sodium,</p>
<p>provided they drink enough water and they don&rsquo;t have chronic</p>
<p>hypertension or high blood pressure is actually beneficial.</p>
<p>Now that doesn&rsquo;t mean you should be drinking seawater.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t mean you should be overindulging in salt,</p>
<p>but many people find that they can manage their mental and</p>
<p>physical state and even feel really terrific,</p>
<p>real clarity of mind and really enjoy their fast when</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re ingesting sufficient salt.</p>
<p>And all it requires really is a small pinch of salt,</p>
<p>ideally Himalayan or sea salt,</p>
<p>if you want to get fancy about it,</p>
<p>but table salt would be fine.</p>
<p>And just drinking that in some water,</p>
<p>maybe with lemon or lime juice to offset the taste a little</p>
<p>bit can really stabilize one&rsquo;s jitters and can stabilize the</p>
<p>mind.</p>
<p>And you might also notice can offset that churning and</p>
<p>yearning and appetite where you can&rsquo;t imagine going another</p>
<p>five minutes before eating something suddenly you feel okay.</p>
<p>And that has to do with a lot of the effects of blood</p>
<p>volume caused by ingesting salt in the appropriate amounts.</p>
<p>In other words, sometimes you think you need food,</p>
<p>but what you really need is salt and salt can make you feel</p>
<p>better immediately.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to mention two excellent zero cost resources.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re going to explore time-restricted feeding,</p>
<p>or maybe if you already are doing time-restricted feeding,</p>
<p>I have no affiliation to either of these,</p>
<p>the first is the website that I mentioned before,</p>
<p>my circadian clock,</p>
<p>which is the website hosted by such in Panda and colleagues.</p>
<p>There are a lot of resources there where you can log your</p>
<p>food intake, get information about time-restricted feeding,</p>
<p>all the science, the ongoing studies, et cetera.</p>
<p>The other is the so-called zero app that makes it very easy</p>
<p>to mark when you&rsquo;re beginning your feeding window.</p>
<p>And when you&rsquo;re ending your feeding window,</p>
<p>and in so doing marking,</p>
<p>when you are beginning your fast and ending your fast,</p>
<p>or at least initiating the beginning of the unfed state,</p>
<p>as we could more accurately call it, it&rsquo;s a terrific app.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve used it from time to time.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t tend to use it in an ongoing basis because I&rsquo;m just</p>
<p>sort of used to eating at a particular time of day now,</p>
<p>but anytime I&rsquo;ve shifted that window, for instance,</p>
<p>a few weeks ago,</p>
<p>I started moving that protein intake in my entire feeding</p>
<p>window earlier in the day.</p>
<p>And because that takes some attention on my part,</p>
<p>because I&rsquo;m not used to doing that,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using the zero app and I like it quite a lot.</p>
<p>It logs your progress and it gives you averages.</p>
<p>And you can see how many other people are fasting again,</p>
<p>totally zero cost.</p>
<p>I actually don&rsquo;t know who owns that app,</p>
<p>but I think they&rsquo;ve done an excellent job.</p>
<p>The interface is really terrific.</p>
<p>And as far as I know, it&rsquo;s available for Apple and Android,</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s at least available for Apple phones,</p>
<p>which is the type of phone I happen to have.</p>
<p>So check those out.</p>
<p>My circadian clock, you just put that into Google,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll find it.</p>
<p>And the zero app, both excellent zero cost resources.</p>
<p>In a moment,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to review the parameters of a ideal feeding</p>
<p>schedule for you and give you the variables that you can</p>
<p>plug into your lifestyle and your preferences.</p>
<p>There are a couple of things that I would place into the</p>
<p>category of frequently asked somewhat odd,</p>
<p>but still worthy of discussion.</p>
<p>For instance, people have asked,</p>
<p>will brushing your teeth with toothpaste, break your fast.</p>
<p>I think unless you&rsquo;re swallowing the toothpaste, no.</p>
<p>Now, if you really want to run out and get a continuous</p>
<p>glucose monitor and brush your teeth,</p>
<p>and you can evaluate that, but no.</p>
<p>People have asked,</p>
<p>will a half glass of wine after dinner,</p>
<p>a couple hours after dinner, break your fast?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>It absolutely will.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s been demonstrated to do that based on the one gram</p>
<p>of sugar kind of eerie or scary effect that I talked about</p>
<p>before scary and eerie,</p>
<p>because it just seems like one gram of sugar.</p>
<p>How could it do that?</p>
<p>But these are metabolic processes and they are</p>
<p>very sensitive post meal.</p>
<p>A few months back,</p>
<p>I did an experiment wearing a continuous glucose monitor.</p>
<p>And I got a surprise when I discovered that going into a</p>
<p>sauna increases my blood glucose quite a bit.</p>
<p>It actually spikes it as high as a meal.</p>
<p>And then it tends to drop back down to baseline or even</p>
<p>slightly below baseline afterwards.</p>
<p>When I talk to people about this, somebody said,</p>
<p>oh, it&rsquo;s got to be that the continuous glucose monitor was</p>
<p>getting disrupted by the heat in the sauna.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s actually not the case.</p>
<p>Turns out that when you go in a sauna,</p>
<p>because you dehydrate, you&rsquo;re losing water.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t drinking water and you&rsquo;re dropping a lot of water.</p>
<p>The concentration of sugar in your blood actually goes up.</p>
<p>And I actually put these data out in a social media post on</p>
<p>Twitter and people were kind of shocked to see how much a</p>
<p>sauna can spike your blood glucose.</p>
<p>Now I do practice time-restricted feeding,</p>
<p>intermittent fasting.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not super strict about it.</p>
<p>I use a kind of eight to 10 hour ish window either early in</p>
<p>the day or late in the day.</p>
<p>I saw this effect of the sauna personally,</p>
<p>the psychological and physical health effects of the sauna</p>
<p>are valuable enough to me that I continue to use it.</p>
<p>I just not concerned about this increase in blood glucose to</p>
<p>the extent that I&rsquo;m going to eliminate sauna.</p>
<p>I like to use the sauna three or four times a week before</p>
<p>sleep.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll use it an hour or two before sleep.</p>
<p>And yes, indeed,</p>
<p>it creates this big spike in blood glucose that then drops</p>
<p>based on change in the concentration of blood sugar.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just not going to worry about it.</p>
<p>Now, if you&rsquo;re concerned about blood glucose spikes,</p>
<p>then you might be worried about it.</p>
<p>But in my case,</p>
<p>it was one of those things where it was interesting and it</p>
<p>was worthy of discussion, I thought,</p>
<p>because it was somewhat surprising to me,</p>
<p>although it makes perfect sense why this would be the case,</p>
<p>but at the end of the day, literally,</p>
<p>it just makes sense for me to get in the sauna.</p>
<p>Okay. So now you&rsquo;ve heard a lot of science.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve heard a lot of examples,</p>
<p>even a few anecdotes,</p>
<p>and let&rsquo;s come up with the ideal intermittent fasting,</p>
<p>AKA time-restricted feeding schedule for you.</p>
<p>And when I say ideal,</p>
<p>I mean, what are the variables that are negotiable?</p>
<p>What are the ones that are non-negotiable?</p>
<p>What is ideal for you will depend on the context of your</p>
<p>life and what you are willing to do consistently.</p>
<p>So first of all,</p>
<p>we established based on the discussion with Sachin,</p>
<p>who is truly the premier world expert in this area,</p>
<p>who knows the animal and human scientific literature better</p>
<p>than anybody has written this incredible review.</p>
<p>And for whom I consulted that you do not want to ingest food</p>
<p>for at least,</p>
<p>I want to emphasize at least 60 minutes post waking up.</p>
<p>Second, you want to avoid ingesting any food</p>
<p>of any kind, even one gram of sugar.</p>
<p>Remember, this is the ideal.</p>
<p>One gram of sugar even would be too much for the two to</p>
<p>three hours prior to bedtime.</p>
<p>He also mentioned, ideally,</p>
<p>you are spending eight hours in bed.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t tell you that earlier. I saved that for now,</p>
<p>but ideally you&rsquo;re sleeping that entire eight hours,</p>
<p>but simply by being in bed for that eight hours and avoiding</p>
<p>food after waking for an hour and before bed for two to three</p>
<p>hours, you&rsquo;re starting to build out the duration of this</p>
<p>fasted period.</p>
<p>Remember that the sleep related fasting is particularly</p>
<p>important for the health benefits of time restricted feeding.</p>
<p>Again, the sleep related fasting is especially important</p>
<p>because of all the cellular repair processes that occur in</p>
<p>the liver, in the gut, in the microbiome,</p>
<p>in the brain, all over the body.</p>
<p>And because of the way that that coordinates the expression</p>
<p>of the clock genes that are then going to wick out and have</p>
<p>many other positive effects on health,</p>
<p>including weight and fat loss.</p>
<p>But in addition to that liver health, et cetera,</p>
<p>an eight hour feeding window as a target seems to be the</p>
<p>best target feeding window,</p>
<p>at least by my read of the literature and in discussing it</p>
<p>with such in shorter feeding windows of four to six hours</p>
<p>tend to lead to overeating and potentially increases in</p>
<p>weight.</p>
<p>One meal per day type eating do not seem to do that,</p>
<p>but those are special cases in that most people can&rsquo;t adhere</p>
<p>to a one meal per day type schedule,</p>
<p>at least not on a regular basis.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not very compatible with most social schedules.</p>
<p>Although some people may be able to adhere to that in a</p>
<p>straightforward way,</p>
<p>but there aren&rsquo;t any robust studies exploring the advantages</p>
<p>of one meal per day.</p>
<p>So if you feel there are advantages of one meal per day for</p>
<p>you, as opposed to an eight hour feeding window,</p>
<p>well then by all means use a one meal per day approach or</p>
<p>use a four to six hour feeding window and just make sure you</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t overeat in that window.</p>
<p>Remember that most people tend to not adhere to the eight</p>
<p>hour feeding window.</p>
<p>They say eight hours,</p>
<p>but they tend to eat outside of the eight hours a little bit</p>
<p>on each side.</p>
<p>So if your goal is a 10 hour feeding window,</p>
<p>you might want to set it to nine hours or eight hours.</p>
<p>If your goal is six hours,</p>
<p>you might want to set it to seven or eight hours.</p>
<p>And this is simply based by, I shouldn&rsquo;t say simply,</p>
<p>this is based on thousands,</p>
<p>if not tens of thousands of human subject data points that</p>
<p>Satchin and colleagues have collected.</p>
<p>Regular placement of the eating window or feeding window</p>
<p>every 24 hours is important.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to be absolutely rigid and neurotic about</p>
<p>this,</p>
<p>but you don&rsquo;t want it sliding around on the weekend so that</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s starting two hours later and ending two hours later a</p>
<p>couple of days a week,</p>
<p>because then you start to offset many of the positive health</p>
<p>effects that have been demonstrated for time restricted</p>
<p>feeding.</p>
<p>Remember if you eat your food within a certain feeding</p>
<p>window,</p>
<p>shifts by a couple hours,</p>
<p>it is effectively like jet lagging your system.</p>
<p>It is effectively like traveling a couple of time zones over</p>
<p>eating there for a few days and coming back when in fact</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re not traveling.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because of the way that food adjusts the</p>
<p>circadian clock genes.</p>
<p>Now you can offset some of that through the use of light.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve talked extensively about how to use light in</p>
<p>previous podcasts, but again,</p>
<p>early morning and all day bright light exposure as safely as</p>
<p>you can, ideally from sunlight,</p>
<p>not through a window, et cetera,</p>
<p>avoiding bright light in the middle of the night,</p>
<p>extremely important for mood offsetting,</p>
<p>metabolic dysfunction, et cetera.</p>
<p>Not incidentally such in his early work was he was one of</p>
<p>the three co-discoverers of the cells in the eye,</p>
<p>the so-called melanopsin cells that set the central</p>
<p>circadian clock.</p>
<p>So he was a pioneer in that field,</p>
<p>which led him to be a pioneer in this field and so on.</p>
<p>When should that eight hour window be placed within each 24</p>
<p>hour cycle?</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s talk about ideal ideal.</p>
<p>If you really want to maximize all the health benefits of</p>
<p>time, restricted feeding,</p>
<p>you need to extend the fast around sleep on both sides.</p>
<p>You would place it smack dab in the middle of the day.</p>
<p>It would be a schedule in which you started eating for</p>
<p>instance, at 10 AM and you stopped eating at 6 PM and</p>
<p>absolutely dreadful schedule for anyone that wants to have</p>
<p>some semblance of a normal life.</p>
<p>In my opinion,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not really compatible with most schedules,</p>
<p>although some people might be able to do it.</p>
<p>Maybe you and your family or your friends,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re, you know,</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re eating a late breakfast or a,</p>
<p>and then you&rsquo;re having a latest lunch around 2 PM.</p>
<p>And then you have dinner at six and then assuming that you</p>
<p>go to bed around nine 30 or 10 PM,</p>
<p>that is going to extract the maximum amount of weight</p>
<p>related body fat related metabolic factor related aspects of</p>
<p>time, restricted feeding.</p>
<p>Some people tend to fall into a category where they do best</p>
<p>placing that feeding window later in the day and provided it</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t run too close to your sleep.</p>
<p>Remember you need a two or three hour buffer before your</p>
<p>sleep where you&rsquo;re not ingesting anything.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s in order to extract the benefits of time,</p>
<p>restricted feeding.</p>
<p>Well then starting your feeding window at 12 PM and ending</p>
<p>at 8 PM plus or minus half an hour or so day-to-day seems</p>
<p>like a perfectly reasonable schedule for some people</p>
<p>starting at 2 PM and ending at 10 PM will be that schedule.</p>
<p>Of course,</p>
<p>you have to take into consideration when you exercise,</p>
<p>if you exercise, for instance,</p>
<p>I like to exercise early in the day,</p>
<p>if I run or if I do some moderate or light intensity</p>
<p>exercise, regardless of what type of exercise it is,</p>
<p>I have no trouble waiting until my feeding window kicks in</p>
<p>around noon or even 2 PM.</p>
<p>But if I do high intensity weight training, for instance,</p>
<p>early in the day,</p>
<p>or if I run sprints and I do that at 7 AM or 8 AM by 11 AM,</p>
<p>I am very, very hungry.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s hard for me to do other things,</p>
<p>concentrate, et cetera.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m not neurotic about my feeding window.</p>
<p>As I mentioned before,</p>
<p>I kind of let it expand and contract a bit around the eight</p>
<p>hour mark and feel perfectly free to do that too.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking here in, in ideals,</p>
<p>not in necessarily practicals,</p>
<p>but other people find that they&rsquo;re very hungry when they</p>
<p>wake up early in the day.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re one of these people,</p>
<p>or you&rsquo;re somebody who really is trying to emphasize</p>
<p>hypertrophy or maintenance of muscle,</p>
<p>then it does seem that ingesting protein early in the day is</p>
<p>beneficial that it can be more readily converted into</p>
<p>muscle tissue.</p>
<p>And this has been demonstrated in at least one study.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s another study underway.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s exploring this further for people that are really,</p>
<p>really interested in hypertrophy and building muscle.</p>
<p>Well,</p>
<p>then time restricted feeding is usually not the way they go.</p>
<p>I mean, let&rsquo;s be honest.</p>
<p>There are many people out there who are eating four or more</p>
<p>meals per day.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re doing that from 7 AM until 8 PM.</p>
<p>I realized that not everybody is overweight.</p>
<p>There is an obesity crisis.</p>
<p>Indeed, you know,</p>
<p>the percentage of obesity and non-alcoholic fatty liver</p>
<p>disease is just cosmic through the roof,</p>
<p>at least in this country and in other countries as well,</p>
<p>this country, me in the U S but other countries as well.</p>
<p>But there are of course,</p>
<p>people that are trying to gain weight or who don&rsquo;t want to</p>
<p>lose weight or who are trying to maximize physical</p>
<p>performance or hypertrophy or things of that sort.</p>
<p>And so of course time restricted feeding for them might be</p>
<p>as long as I&rsquo;m awake, I&rsquo;m eating.</p>
<p>And I, you know,</p>
<p>tip my hat to those people and just say, you know,</p>
<p>provided you understand what you&rsquo;re doing and the burden</p>
<p>that that places on some of the other processes in your</p>
<p>body, if that&rsquo;s right for you,</p>
<p>then by all means pursue that.</p>
<p>Another thing that we can add to this summary or key points</p>
<p>related to time restricted feeding is the use of glucose</p>
<p>disposal agents and or behaviors.</p>
<p>If you find that you&rsquo;ve eaten too close to a period of time</p>
<p>in which you would prefer to be fasting,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s when a 30 minute brisk walk or even modest walk</p>
<p>after eating can be beneficial.</p>
<p>Ingesting some lemon juice or lime juice can help lower</p>
<p>blood glucose somewhat.</p>
<p>And then there are the things like metformin and berberine.</p>
<p>There are even some supplements out there that combine</p>
<p>things like berberine cinnamon,</p>
<p>which can lower blood glucose and things like chromium and</p>
<p>things that have a mild effect on blood glucose,</p>
<p>but berberine and metformin are very high potency glucose</p>
<p>disposal agents.</p>
<p>And I mentioned earlier why you would want to approach those</p>
<p>with the appropriate level of caution and figure out the</p>
<p>dosages for you.</p>
<p>And for some people,</p>
<p>the dosages will be zero milligrams is going to be ideal.</p>
<p>And then of course we discussed how making sure that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>ingesting enough fluids in particular water and salt,</p>
<p>especially if you&rsquo;re using caffeine in order to increase</p>
<p>your levels of alertness,</p>
<p>regardless of where that caffeine source comes from coffee</p>
<p>tea or otherwise that can cause the excretion of sodium and</p>
<p>can lead to a kind of shakiness,</p>
<p>a lightheadedness and the feelings of hunger that may or may</p>
<p>not be related to blood glucose.</p>
<p>Some people genuinely need to eat.</p>
<p>I certainly would not want to see people getting</p>
<p>hypoglycemic to the point where it&rsquo;s dangerous.</p>
<p>Certainly if you are diabetic, you, and in fact,</p>
<p>for all people,</p>
<p>you should consult with your physician when exploring any</p>
<p>major changes to diet or additions or subtractions of</p>
<p>anything, including supplementation.</p>
<p>But for most people maintaining relatively low to modest</p>
<p>blood glucose levels is going to be pretty healthy and will</p>
<p>allow all the positive effects of intermittent fasting to</p>
<p>occur.</p>
<p>And when you find that reaching that start to the feeding</p>
<p>window is challenging that ingesting sodium can often</p>
<p>stabilize your system mentally and physically and allow</p>
<p>you to reach that window often painlessly.</p>
<p>And then as a final point, as I mentioned earlier,</p>
<p>provided that they are consumed in low,</p>
<p>no or modest amounts,</p>
<p>artificial sweeteners or plant-based non-sugar,</p>
<p>non-caloric sweeteners don&rsquo;t seem to really impact blood</p>
<p>glucose to the extent that it would quote unquote,</p>
<p>take you out of your fast.</p>
<p>But that like fat fasting is something that&rsquo;s going to be</p>
<p>highly individual and that you&rsquo;re going to have to</p>
<p>experiment with for yourself and being able to recognize</p>
<p>when you&rsquo;re in a fast and when you&rsquo;re out of a fast at a</p>
<p>subjective level and not constantly having to measure your</p>
<p>blood glucose or do things of that sort can be beneficial.</p>
<p>And I think if you watch for the feelings associated with</p>
<p>eating and post-eating foods of different kinds and</p>
<p>different amounts,</p>
<p>and you watch for the feelings associated with being fasted</p>
<p>for long periods of time or short periods of time of having</p>
<p>gotten sufficient sunlight of having trained hard or not</p>
<p>trained hard earlier that day, et cetera,</p>
<p>you can do the most important thing,</p>
<p>which is to start to learn, to evaluate your own system,</p>
<p>to run simple,</p>
<p>safe experiments on your system in a way that allows you to</p>
<p>really establish the ideal nutrition schedule for you,</p>
<p>whether it be time-restricted feeding,</p>
<p>AKA intermittent fasting or some other nutritional plan.</p>

<p>In addition,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re not already following Huberman lab on Instagram</p>
<p>there, I do brief posts about science that often are not</p>
<p>covered on the podcast.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s Huberman lab on Instagram.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re also on Twitter, also at Huberman lab.</p>
<p>Recently we launched a clips channel, Huberman lab clips.</p>
<p>Please check out our clips channel and subscribe there for</p>
<p>brief excerpts from the various Huberman lab podcasts.</p>
<p>In addition,</p>
<p>please check out our sponsors that we mentioned at the</p>
<p>beginning of this episode.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a terrific way to support the podcast.</p>
<p>And as mentioned at the beginning of today&rsquo;s episode,</p>
<p>we are now partnered with momentous supplements because they</p>
<p>make single ingredient formulations that are the absolute</p>
<p>highest quality and they ship international.</p>
<p>If you go to live momentous.com slash Huberman,</p>
<p>you will find many of the supplements that have been</p>
<p>discussed on various episodes of the Huberman lab podcast.</p>
<p>And you will find various protocols related to those</p>
<p>supplements.</p>
<p>I know we covered a lot of information today.</p>
<p>I hope you learned a lot about time-restricted feeding.</p>
<p>I hope you learned a lot about metabolism and energy and</p>
<p>health and how,</p>
<p>when you eat is as important as what you eat and last,</p>
<p>but certainly not least,</p>
<p>thank you for your interest in science.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
