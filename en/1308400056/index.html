    <p>Hi friends, today we&rsquo;re talking all things business.</p>
<p>This is going to be everything that I wish someone fucking told me before I started my</p>
<p>business and lost a lot of money.</p>
<p>Because I&rsquo;ve started a few now and I&rsquo;ve probably lost close to like 35-ish thousand dollars</p>
<p>and I&rsquo;m going to go through everything mentally, how to set up and prepare for shit and then</p>
<p>just some tips about how to like navigate things and save yourself some money because</p>
<p>if someone&rsquo;s going to learn something from it, let it be you.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t make the same mistakes I did and don&rsquo;t let your mind get in the way of shit, okay?</p>
<p>And then I&rsquo;m going to leave you off with a message at the end of how to know if you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>cut out for it and I&rsquo;m going to tell you if you have what it takes or not, how to tell.</p>
<p>Or go work your ass at a normal fucking job.</p>
<p>So we have a lot to cover.</p>
<p>I have a giant list in front of me but let&rsquo;s just jump into it.</p>
<p>So the first thing with mindset and my biggest heartbreak with business that I want to prevent</p>
<p>you from because it crippled my ass is you need to disconnect the thought of being a</p>
<p>good person and having a good heart from being successful.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t fucking matter if you have a good heart.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t fucking matter how helpful you want to be and how good your intentions are</p>
<p>and how pure you are.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t fucking matter.</p>
<p>Business is strategy.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s rule fucking number one to get, okay?</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t go through the heartbreak that I did.</p>
<p>The universe is not going to back you.</p>
<p>God himself is not going to back you.</p>
<p>Business is strategy.</p>
<p>It is not heart.</p>
<p>Take your fucking heart out of it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s good to have good intentions.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s good to have a pure heart.</p>
<p>You have to have something that&rsquo;s going to like burn inside you to keep you going with</p>
<p>the business because it&rsquo;s a lot.</p>
<p>But what I&rsquo;m saying is having a good heart and having a good intentions does not lead</p>
<p>to success.</p>
<p>It does not lead to you making money.</p>
<p>It does not lead to you doing right and doing well.</p>
<p>Or else the world would look a lot fucking different.</p>
<p>Business is about your skills, not your heart, okay?</p>
<p>Remember me yelling this at you because I needed someone to hit me upside the fucking</p>
<p>head with it.</p>
<p>Everything is about your skills and business is a skill.</p>
<p>Becoming business minded is a skill and you need to learn it and you need to invest all</p>
<p>your time and energy into your skills, not your heart and daydreaming and thinking about</p>
<p>all these good things that make you feel good.</p>
<p>You got to get down in the fucking square reality of life, not this spiritual shit that</p>
<p>people talk about.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also going to talk about not following your fucking purpose.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a crock of shit in a few minutes.</p>
<p>But my biggest point with this is do not expect having a good heart to get you far or guarantee</p>
<p>you anything.</p>
<p>Having a good heart and being successful don&rsquo;t go together.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t coincide.</p>
<p>One does not stack on the other.</p>
<p>Sure, it&rsquo;s good to have a good heart.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s good to have good intentions.</p>
<p>But if you go into a business and creating anything with just focusing on your sole intention</p>
<p>of like I want to help people.</p>
<p>I want to do this thing.</p>
<p>I want to whatever because I have good intentions.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to be heartbroken.</p>
<p>Life is going to knock you upside the fucking head and knock you on your ass.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re going to be left in that pit of hopelessness that I was in.</p>
<p>So go ahead and disconnect that out of your brain right now.</p>
<p>Having a good heart does not mean you&rsquo;re going to be successful.</p>
<p>Sorry.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so many more things that play into it.</p>
<p>But with that, let&rsquo;s jump into the next thing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to talk about self-doubt for a second because a lot of people deal with not feeling</p>
<p>good enough.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one of the number one things I see come across my coaching applications is like</p>
<p>every single person.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care if they&rsquo;re a millionaire or someone that&rsquo;s struggling financially.</p>
<p>Every single one of these people that apply to work with me, all right in their fucking</p>
<p>application, they deal with not feeling good enough and they want help with it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s always going to come up.</p>
<p>But the biggest thing that helped me with not feeling good enough is you have to understand</p>
<p>what you&rsquo;re doing when you have a business.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re offering a service or a product, it&rsquo;s not about you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not about you not feeling good enough.</p>
<p>This is about what you can do for others, what value is being given.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not about the person usually.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m speaking real vague and real big.</p>
<p>But the thing that&rsquo;s going to help you with self-doubt is it&rsquo;s not in you and what&rsquo;s going</p>
<p>on with you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s in your skills and your abilities.</p>
<p>Your business is your ability or your product or whatever it is.</p>
<p>But an example from my life with my coaching business, I have been in periods where like</p>
<p>my life is a fucking wreck and I&rsquo;m having to coach myself on the side and also coach</p>
<p>other people.</p>
<p>And a lot of people would get insecure and be like, Oh my God, no, if my life isn&rsquo;t perfect,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not qualified to help.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where I&rsquo;m going to say it does not matter what your life is like while you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>helping other people.</p>
<p>If you can still provide the service, if you can still provide the value and if I can properly</p>
<p>coach other people, even while I&rsquo;m dealing with my own shit, that&rsquo;s perfectly fine.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not a fuck up.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not backwards.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not an imposter.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not a fake.</p>
<p>Life is going to throw shit at you.</p>
<p>And with that example, it&rsquo;s kind of specific, but a lot of people deal with insecurities.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s one way to nix it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not about you and your life and what&rsquo;s going on with you and how you feel and all</p>
<p>of a sudden that you could be breaking down, crying yourself to sleep and then wake up</p>
<p>in the morning and go coach someone and be on your fucking a game.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s just how things go.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not about yourself.</p>
<p>So remove yourself from that and you&rsquo;ll be a lot less insecure.</p>
<p>Focus on your abilities and what you&rsquo;re providing through your business.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what people care about.</p>
<p>And honestly, it takes a really fucking strong and capable person to do the shit that I do.</p>
<p>Like to position as a mentor or any kind of coach, that&rsquo;s a big role to step into.</p>
<p>And even when my life is falling apart, I was very good at this when I was a nurse too,</p>
<p>is like, it doesn&rsquo;t matter what&rsquo;s going on in my life.</p>
<p>When I step in that patient&rsquo;s room, when I get on the call with one of my clients, I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>in their world.</p>
<p>I get out of mine and help them navigate theirs.</p>
<p>My abilities don&rsquo;t go away because I&rsquo;m dealing with shit and like certain circumstances in</p>
<p>my life.</p>
<p>Like that doesn&rsquo;t take away from your abilities.</p>
<p>You can still exercise them.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t make you any less qualified or capable.</p>
<p>So just focus on that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about your ability or whatever your product is.</p>
<p>So the next thing that stunted me a lot and held me back a lot is not moving fast.</p>
<p>Bitch, move as fast as fucking possible.</p>
<p>Do not wait.</p>
<p>Do not sit on ideas.</p>
<p>If you have an idea, put your fucking ass behind it quickly.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a spiritual explanation and then a not spiritual one.</p>
<p>The spiritual explanation is ideas visit you.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not here to hang around all the time.</p>
<p>Ideas are energy that wants to be manifested and actualized.</p>
<p>So this energy has its own consciousness and it will visit people and it&rsquo;s just taking</p>
<p>a chance visiting different people that it thinks could help manifest it.</p>
<p>So if you have an idea for something and you don&rsquo;t act on it, the idea is going to</p>
<p>leave you.</p>
<p>So you need to act on shit when you have the idea.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a piece of consciousness that wants to be actualized through you.</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t have long and you need to fucking act on shit while you have it.</p>
<p>Like I said, it&rsquo;s a visitor.</p>
<p>Ideas visit you.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll fucking leave too.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ll jump to the next person who will actualize them and then it&rsquo;s too late for</p>
<p>you.</p>
<p>You lost your shot.</p>
<p>So if you have an idea and you have something that&rsquo;s like burning inside of you, fucking</p>
<p>act on it.</p>
<p>And if there&rsquo;s something that you&rsquo;ve had an idea about for a long time and you just never</p>
<p>acted on it and it hasn&rsquo;t left you, get to it.</p>
<p>That idea wants to be actualized through you in specific, okay?</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not going to hang around for long.</p>
<p>So if you got something that you&rsquo;ve always wanted to do, fucking do it.</p>
<p>Trust me, just do it.</p>
<p>So also with moving fast, here&rsquo;s like the real life shit because that was like a little</p>
<p>spiritual example.</p>
<p>But with real life, move fucking quick, bitch.</p>
<p>Get on it.</p>
<p>Stop waiting for things to be perfect and do not paralyze yourself by trying to think</p>
<p>of all the things that can go wrong.</p>
<p>Like you&rsquo;re going to think of things that can go wrong because that&rsquo;s how your brain</p>
<p>is wired.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re wired to spot unsafety and things that could hurt you.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re considering starting a business and you have to get to step one to start it,</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re just sitting here behind the start line looking at everything that could go wrong</p>
<p>in the future and not stepping forward, you&rsquo;re never going to fucking go anywhere.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s something that paralyzed me for a long time was trying to think 10 steps in</p>
<p>advance about things that could possibly go wrong.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t fucking waste your time.</p>
<p>Just do it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not going to know how to handle shit until you face it, until it&rsquo;s an actual reality.</p>
<p>So don&rsquo;t spend time thinking about things that are potentials.</p>
<p>Do things to prepare.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Be smart.</p>
<p>Be calculated.</p>
<p>Be very strategic.</p>
<p>But do not get paralyzed by the thought of like things that haven&rsquo;t happened yet.</p>
<p>Face them as they happen.</p>
<p>Stop like catastrophizing about shit and just jump into it.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s like with my dad when I was little, I didn&rsquo;t know how to swim, okay?</p>
<p>So he took me and threw me in the deep end of the pool and he said, sink or swim.</p>
<p>Learn to swim, fucker.</p>
<p>And what did I do?</p>
<p>Learn to swim.</p>
<p>Now, if I sat on the side of the pool and was just sitting there like, okay, I&rsquo;m going</p>
<p>to learn how to swim and then I&rsquo;m going to jump in when I feel ready.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to waste so much fucking time sitting on the side of that pool.</p>
<p>You would learn to swim in about 15 seconds if you just jumped in that bitch.</p>
<p>But sitting on the sideline, you could sit there for a full fucking day and watch YouTube</p>
<p>videos and read things and practice stroking before you&rsquo;re ever in the water.</p>
<p>Motherfucker, just jump in.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll learn so much faster.</p>
<p>Like everything, speed, remember?</p>
<p>Everything&rsquo;s fast.</p>
<p>Everything is fast, fast, fast.</p>
<p>Like get up and fucking do it.</p>
<p>Stop waiting on the sidelines.</p>
<p>Stop trying to prepare.</p>
<p>Stop catastrophizing.</p>
<p>Jump in that shit.</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s a shark in the water, we&rsquo;ll deal with it.</p>
<p>But you deal with it once you&rsquo;re in, bitch.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the thing.</p>
<p>Stop trying to deal with shit and worry and waste time thinking about it before it happens.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying with everything, but with most things, you&rsquo;re just holding yourself back</p>
<p>in your fucking brain.</p>
<p>Okay, so now I want to talk about choosing what to do because there&rsquo;s so many fucking</p>
<p>things that you can start or like choose to try.</p>
<p>And I want you to walk through the thought process of choose whatever thing that you</p>
<p>can live with the worst case scenario.</p>
<p>Make that be your first goal or like jump.</p>
<p>Make that your first risk.</p>
<p>So any of your options, if there&rsquo;s a lot of options where the worst case scenario would</p>
<p>be like devastating and you couldn&rsquo;t handle it, don&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>For your first thing you&rsquo;re going to try, do the thing that you can actually live with</p>
<p>the worst case scenario.</p>
<p>Like, all right, it would fucking suck ass, but like I would make it or I could figure</p>
<p>it out and I&rsquo;d be okay.</p>
<p>Try that first.</p>
<p>And the first thing that you pick is not what you have to stick with.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m always talking about pick and stick, but with business, you have to be very, very open</p>
<p>and ready to change and shift on like the drop of a hat.</p>
<p>Like everything can shift like in one hour, okay?</p>
<p>From personal experience, be on your fucking toes and be ready, be on your A game.</p>
<p>But don&rsquo;t get overwhelmed thinking, oh, if I pick this one thing, it&rsquo;s like, oh, I have</p>
<p>to do only that.</p>
<p>You can literally switch at any minute.</p>
<p>So just literally pick a pool to jump in, jump, learn to swim.</p>
<p>And then when you&rsquo;re swimming in that pool, think, okay, is there another pool I want</p>
<p>to go try out?</p>
<p>Learn the skills from the first thing first that you feel is manageable.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like if you&rsquo;re thinking of jumping in a kiddie pool versus jumping in the ocean,</p>
<p>jump in the fucking kiddie pool first, learn the skills, learn what you need to know.</p>
<p>And then you can handle the fucking ocean way easier.</p>
<p>But if you do try to just jump straight for the ocean, a lot of people like you&rsquo;ll learn</p>
<p>how to fucking swim and you&rsquo;ll grow so much faster.</p>
<p>But a lot of people get so stuck facing that big ocean, that big scary thing that they&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not fucking prepared for, they&rsquo;ll never jump in.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re at a place where you have this giant vision and this huge thing you want</p>
<p>to do, but you&rsquo;re too scared to do it, you can&rsquo;t figure out a way, it&rsquo;s like whatever</p>
<p>it is, just jump in the kiddie pool first.</p>
<p>Jump at the smaller option, the smaller opportunity, get your fucking feet wet until you feel confident</p>
<p>and you can jump in the ocean or just jump in the fucking ocean.</p>
<p>Literally that&rsquo;s what I fucking did.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve sunk and I fucking got beat the fuck up and it was rough, rough time.</p>
<p>But like I&rsquo;m so much further ahead than so many people at 24 years old.</p>
<p>Like the amount I know about life itself, please, and then the amount that I now know</p>
<p>about business is because I took the huge risks.</p>
<p>I jumped into the big shit first.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m saying something&rsquo;s better than nothing.</p>
<p>So jump in your kiddie pool if you need to or jump in the fucking ocean and figure it</p>
<p>out.</p>
<p>I kind of got off track with that.</p>
<p>But with choosing what to do, look at the advantages you already have.</p>
<p>Like if you have something, what is something that you already have a lot of skills in?</p>
<p>You already have a lot of knowledge about or you&rsquo;ve already spent a lot of time doing</p>
<p>that you don&rsquo;t fucking hate.</p>
<p>Like when I chose to make the switch from nursing to all the things that I&rsquo;m doing,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m about to make a clothing line.</p>
<p>I was thinking about making merch, but I have too many designs and I&rsquo;ve always wanted a</p>
<p>clothing line and I can&rsquo;t wait to make like everything that I&rsquo;m going to wear.</p>
<p>Like I just want to replace my wardrobe, you know, but I&rsquo;m in the middle of making a clothing</p>
<p>line.</p>
<p>But when I made the switch from nursing into trying to start businesses, like that was</p>
<p>a whole different fucking world.</p>
<p>So I understand if you absolutely hate the thing that you&rsquo;re doing and you want no part</p>
<p>of it, like the medical field can eat my ass.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want nothing to do with it.</p>
<p>But just know if you choose to do something that you already have experience in, it will</p>
<p>be a lot easier.</p>
<p>It will go a lot faster.</p>
<p>It will be a lot smoother versus if you try something new like I did and you completely</p>
<p>have no fucking clue what you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s going to take a lot longer.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to drag the fuck out because you&rsquo;re starting from like ground zero versus like</p>
<p>ground 50.</p>
<p>If I would have done something in the medical field, like if I got into like medical sales</p>
<p>or created a product or like done something medical wise, I would have been able to execute</p>
<p>a lot faster.</p>
<p>But I chose a different route because the medical field makes me want to kill myself.</p>
<p>So I understand that.</p>
<p>And I relate to that.</p>
<p>A lot of people that preach like business shit, they completely discard the fact that</p>
<p>you have feelings and you have to enjoy your life.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a good way to navigate that.</p>
<p>Do something you&rsquo;re already like good at and you already have experience with and you already</p>
<p>have like an upper hand.</p>
<p>Think of the areas or the things where you already have the upper hand.</p>
<p>How do you already have more than most?</p>
<p>How are you already 10 steps ahead with something?</p>
<p>You can choose to go down that route or you can choose to try something completely different.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m just saying if your main concern is money, go down the one that you already know</p>
<p>first and then like I said, you can switch later.</p>
<p>Now I want to talk about following your fucking purpose because all these spiritual shitheads</p>
<p>get on here talking about if you follow your purpose, abundance will follow.</p>
<p>Fuck you personally and individually.</p>
<p>Fuck every single one of you who&rsquo;s preaching that horse shit because no, no, there&rsquo;s so</p>
<p>much more to it.</p>
<p>I believe I am in my purpose, but the absolute shit show that&rsquo;s come with it, they need to</p>
<p>give you a heads up.</p>
<p>If you follow your purpose, abundance will follow, but it is literally going to fucking</p>
<p>ruin you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be so difficult because if you follow something that is like your purpose</p>
<p>and something that you are very emotionally invested in, you&rsquo;re 10 times more attached</p>
<p>to an outcome.</p>
<p>So when things don&rsquo;t work, they&rsquo;re 10 times more devastating.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to question yourself so much more.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to question your purpose.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to quit.</p>
<p>Oh my God, don&rsquo;t even fucking bother.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re not absolutely 100% clear on your purpose, don&rsquo;t even fucking bother trying</p>
<p>to start something and find it because you&rsquo;re going to sit there and be like, I want to</p>
<p>start this business.</p>
<p>I want to start these things, but I have to know my purpose first.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re going to spend all this fucking time wasting, trying to figure out what your</p>
<p>purpose is so you can make the right business.</p>
<p>Fuck that.</p>
<p>If you were like driven about business and you want to create your own thing or you just</p>
<p>have any interest in it and you want to start your own business, fucking start something</p>
<p>first.</p>
<p>Make money, get your fucking shit together, learn some skills, and then take everything</p>
<p>that you learn and invest that and switch.</p>
<p>Like I said, and pivot and choose the thing that makes you feel good and makes you happy</p>
<p>and feels like your purpose.</p>
<p>You can fully shift and you shouldn&rsquo;t be worrying about finding your fucking purpose until you</p>
<p>got a little money under your belt and you got some skills to apply to following your</p>
<p>purpose.</p>
<p>Because if you just blindly follow your fucking purpose, you&rsquo;re fucked.</p>
<p>You literally have to take so much more into consideration.</p>
<p>It sounds so nice to be all spiritual.</p>
<p>Oh my God, I&rsquo;m going to follow my purpose.</p>
<p>Abundance is just going to follow.</p>
<p>No bitch, you got to set that up.</p>
<p>You have to teach it how to flow in.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a just magically or like universally orchestrated thing that happens.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry to burst your bubble, but I don&rsquo;t want you to go through the heartbreak that</p>
<p>I fucking went through with all of this.</p>
<p>So literally, don&rsquo;t fucking worry about your purpose for now.</p>
<p>It will find you.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t not actualize it.</p>
<p>You know, like it&rsquo;s going to fucking come up.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to show if you have something that you think is your purpose and you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>not clear about it, start anything and it will become more and more clear because even</p>
<p>if you go down the wrong road or an opposite direction of your purpose, if you have an</p>
<p>experience where you realize, okay, this is not where I want to go, what are you going</p>
<p>to do?</p>
<p>Turn around off that road and go back in the direction of something else, which could be</p>
<p>your purpose.</p>
<p>You might go down 12 different fucking roads and have to keep turning around.</p>
<p>But if you just stood still and never followed anything, you would be all those 10 roads.</p>
<p>Those are all steps back.</p>
<p>You wouldn&rsquo;t be closer to your purpose.</p>
<p>Your purpose is not going to be like a pretty direct thing.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to be like mind fucked and like bounced over all these different things.</p>
<p>Literally do not worry about following your purpose until you&rsquo;ve made fucking money and</p>
<p>you can follow it.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t worry about enjoying business until you&rsquo;ve made money and you have the luxury</p>
<p>to choose to follow what you enjoy.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one thing a lot of people fuck up and misguided me on.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like that shit and I will never steer you guys in the wrong direction.</p>
<p>Shit&rsquo;s got to get rough for a minute.</p>
<p>You got some things to learn.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easier to learn those things when you&rsquo;re not following the thing that you&rsquo;re just so</p>
<p>like, oh my God, emotionally invested in.</p>
<p>Because like I said, every single setback is going to feel like a dagger to the fucking</p>
<p>heart and I don&rsquo;t want you to deal with that.</p>
<p>I could teach you how to get through it, but I really, really think if you don&rsquo;t know anything</p>
<p>about business, do not follow how you feel first.</p>
<p>You have a lot of skills to learn and I&rsquo;m talking to young people now.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re older than me and you&rsquo;re a lot more in touch with yourself and you have more experience</p>
<p>to draw from, go for it.</p>
<p>You fucking know yourself and if you&rsquo;re young and you&rsquo;re like 100% like, yes, I just need</p>
<p>to do this one thing.</p>
<p>I have no interest in anything else.</p>
<p>Fucking do it.</p>
<p>Just take this as a precaution.</p>
<p>Prepare for everything and all of your emotions to be wrapped up in that fucking bitch and</p>
<p>when things seem very devastating, I promise they&rsquo;re not that bad.</p>
<p>Get back organized and focused, like factual, strategic and analytical.</p>
<p>Get analytical with your purpose if you&rsquo;re going to try and make it into a business so</p>
<p>it doesn&rsquo;t get so messy.</p>
<p>Also one more thing with deciding what to do.</p>
<p>Stick to your fucking values because I have so many opportunities at money and I&rsquo;m not</p>
<p>taking them.</p>
<p>Like I have a lot of brand deals and people reach out to me and offer me like 10 grand,</p>
<p>12 grand.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m working on a deal right now for like 15 but that&rsquo;s what the brand I actually like</p>
<p>but there are a lot of brands that reach out to me and I don&rsquo;t like their products.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t genuinely like their products so I&rsquo;m not going to take their money to fucking talk</p>
<p>about it.</p>
<p>I have to turn down money all the time.</p>
<p>Try your best to stick to your values.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be hard.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be difficult but your self-respect is all you have.</p>
<p>Your character is all you have.</p>
<p>If you lose that to some money, you&rsquo;re fucking worthless.</p>
<p>That was rough.</p>
<p>That was real rough.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t let money sway you.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not saying in situations where you like have a choice because a lot of people</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t have a choice.</p>
<p>Like there are, I&rsquo;m friends with some strippers and they don&rsquo;t have a choice.</p>
<p>Like they have to take care of their entire family.</p>
<p>None of them have fucking money so they have to go work.</p>
<p>Do they want to be stripping?</p>
<p>Fuck no.</p>
<p>Do I want to make an OnlyFans?</p>
<p>That is my plan Z.</p>
<p>Okay not even my plan B, C, D. That&rsquo;s my plan Z.</p>
<p>If everything goes to shit and I have to take care of my family or if I have a situation</p>
<p>where I&rsquo;m like my livelihood&rsquo;s at stake, I&rsquo;m going to exhaust every option and then I&rsquo;ll</p>
<p>go to that if I have to.</p>
<p>But let me not be so fucking harsh about that because I understand there&rsquo;s so many things.</p>
<p>Like when I was used to like, can I say this online?</p>
<p>Like when I used to like serve, not as a waiter.</p>
<p>How do I say this?</p>
<p>Like how do I make it clear?</p>
<p>Like when I used to deal cards.</p>
<p>Did I want to be doing that?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Did I have bills to pay?</p>
<p>Did I have a life to fucking maintain?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>There are things you have to do and I understand that fully.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been through a lot of experiences with that.</p>
<p>But hold yourself and your self-respect as high as you can if the situation and the circumstances</p>
<p>allow it.</p>
<p>Okay?</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t just sacrifice your fucking values and shit because things got difficult.</p>
<p>Like if it&rsquo;s a dire situation, do it.</p>
<p>Okay?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to just shut up there because I&rsquo;m getting heated.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So now I want to talk about do not get legal before you start making money in your business.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t give a fuck if that&rsquo;s bad business advice.</p>
<p>I wasted so much fucking money and time trying to get legal.</p>
<p>So like with my app, I hired an attorney to trademark it and then I hired that attorney</p>
<p>again to make contracts for me to go hire a developer, an NDA and a work for hire agreement.</p>
<p>So NDA is a nondisclosure.</p>
<p>So any ideas I share, anything that we talk about can&rsquo;t be disclosed with anyone.</p>
<p>And then I had the work for hire agreement that anything that they make for me is legally</p>
<p>mine.</p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t hold shit.</p>
<p>Once I pay them and they make me something, I own it.</p>
<p>I own every part of it.</p>
<p>I had these contracts made and it was a fucking waste because if these businesses, like I&rsquo;m</p>
<p>up against the big digital like marketing agency and software development company.</p>
<p>So if I were to try and like act on any of those contracts, let&rsquo;s say they did make something</p>
<p>for me.</p>
<p>They stole my idea and they took that shit and my money.</p>
<p>What the fuck am I supposed to do?</p>
<p>You have to go hire an attorney to sue them for your contract to even matter.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t just walk in with a contract and be like, you didn&rsquo;t do what you said.</p>
<p>No bitch.</p>
<p>You got to take them to court.</p>
<p>And probably $100,000 is a fucking lawsuit shit.</p>
<p>You can only act on a contract if you have the money to fight in court.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t fucking worry about a contract.</p>
<p>People are going to fuck you.</p>
<p>People are going to try and like play with you and like everyone in business is looking</p>
<p>out for their own ass.</p>
<p>So I want you to remember that number one.</p>
<p>And it is not wrong for you to look out for your own ass in business.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t look out for yourself, no one else will.</p>
<p>Remember me saying this.</p>
<p>And again, trust no one till the fucking day I die.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s tattooed on me forever unless I lose my hand.</p>
<p>But opening all these companies like an LLC or like a sole proprietorship, anything you</p>
<p>want to open, don&rsquo;t get fucking legal until you make money.</p>
<p>You need a way to process payment and accept money.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t fucking need all this legal bullshit.</p>
<p>You can get that as you start making money.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m also going to say.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t spend stupid fucking money.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need to literally don&rsquo;t buy shit that is not necessary.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need all this fancy flashy fucking shit.</p>
<p>What your focus needs to be if you&rsquo;re starting a business is a way to accept money.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s number one.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s your first thing.</p>
<p>Not an LLC, not a fucking contract, not a fucking trademark.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t waste your time.</p>
<p>Do not get legal.</p>
<p>Do not invest money into that shit until you are making money.</p>
<p>Trust me, that would have saved me $20,000 fucking dollars.</p>
<p>Okay, so here&rsquo;s some tips for once you do get legal and you start working with a team,</p>
<p>you hire a company or you start getting legal with anything like you start meeting up with</p>
<p>lawyers, attorneys, anything like that.</p>
<p>These are some tips for that.</p>
<p>So number one is you want to do Zoom meetings or in-person meetings.</p>
<p>You want them to see your fucking face because it is a lot easier to deceive someone, lie</p>
<p>to someone, cheat someone, and fuck someone over that you cannot humanify.</p>
<p>Humanify?</p>
<p>Personify?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the word.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t personify them.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t look at them as a real human being.</p>
<p>A voice on a phone?</p>
<p>Who the fuck is that?</p>
<p>Could be anything.</p>
<p>Could be anyone.</p>
<p>If they can see you and experience you and you make yourself a real person to them, that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>kind of a manipulation tactic to solidify.</p>
<p>A lot of businessmen are corrupt as fuck and they&rsquo;ll fuck you anyway.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll literally watch your whole family dying in front of you and they&rsquo;ll just stand</p>
<p>there like, well, a lot of business people are cold, it&rsquo;s very cutthroat.</p>
<p>But my point with that is just a little psychology trick.</p>
<p>People can&rsquo;t lie as easy when you&rsquo;re face to face and if they do lie, you can pick up</p>
<p>on it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to tell in just someone&rsquo;s voice, but if you can watch them, their mannerisms,</p>
<p>if you can get a baseline read of how they usually are and then you see a change in that</p>
<p>behavior that&rsquo;s usually a lie or some kind of deceit.</p>
<p>Read some fucking books on body language and learn how to read people.</p>
<p>But the biggest thing is talk to them face to fucking face.</p>
<p>If possible.</p>
<p>If not, Zoom meetings.</p>
<p>See your goddamn face.</p>
<p>And read back.</p>
<p>Literally read back.</p>
<p>Every single thing.</p>
<p>You guys agree on or talk about.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a nursing skill that I use and implement all the time with this shit.</p>
<p>It will clear up so many miscommunications.</p>
<p>So when someone says something to you and they agree to something or you&rsquo;re talking</p>
<p>about ideas.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Let me read this back to you.</p>
<p>Make sure I got it right.</p>
<p>You read back what you just perceived from them saying something.</p>
<p>So you are on the same page at all times.</p>
<p>And if you are at step one and there&rsquo;s already a miscommunication, you clear it up before</p>
<p>you go to step two.</p>
<p>Trust me.</p>
<p>Read back will save your fucking ass.</p>
<p>Next thing.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re concerned about something.</p>
<p>Say it.</p>
<p>Voice it.</p>
<p>Communicate it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t give a fuck how stupid it seems.</p>
<p>How insecure.</p>
<p>How childish.</p>
<p>Voice that shit.</p>
<p>Voice anything you are concerned about to anyone that you&rsquo;re paying or anyone that you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>working with.</p>
<p>One hundred percent.</p>
<p>Next.</p>
<p>If you have any questions, ask.</p>
<p>Do not get off a call or leave an interaction with someone that you are fucking paying without</p>
<p>absolute clarity.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s around anything you have questions on, what they&rsquo;re expected to do, what you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>expected to do, what the agreement is, what the timeframe is.</p>
<p>Everything needs to be crystal fucking clear.</p>
<p>And I want you to record all fucking phone calls and write shit down.</p>
<p>Get everything sent in words via their email.</p>
<p>Everything needs to be agreed upon in writing and have auditory recordings of shit.</p>
<p>Because a lot of people try and go back on like things that they&rsquo;ve said to me.</p>
<p>Like with my development team, it&rsquo;s like there was a lot of miscommunication and they said</p>
<p>one thing and then when I thought it was one way and I clarified that, they said, no, we</p>
<p>didn&rsquo;t say that.</p>
<p>Record that fucking shit.</p>
<p>Record every fucking call you have.</p>
<p>Because people like to go back on their word, especially if they get in a pinch.</p>
<p>Like I said, everyone&rsquo;s out for their own fucking ass.</p>
<p>Clock them.</p>
<p>Prevent that shit.</p>
<p>And with that, I want to say, do not hire a fucking company to do shit.</p>
<p>Like when I created Positive Focus, my app, I hired a really big company because that&rsquo;s</p>
<p>what I wanted because it made me feel like more stable and more like secure with having</p>
<p>my app created and developed.</p>
<p>I felt more official and I felt like it was more organized.</p>
<p>No bitch, it costs 10 times fucking more and they&rsquo;re just as unorganized as other people.</p>
<p>Find a student.</p>
<p>Find a student for anything that you&rsquo;re wanting to start, whether it&rsquo;s creating websites,</p>
<p>designing apps, making brochures, photography, anything.</p>
<p>Go find fucking students at a university.</p>
<p>Go find people on Fiverr.</p>
<p>Go find people anywhere you fucking can before you go to a big business.</p>
<p>Trust me.</p>
<p>Because they&rsquo;re going to be a lot fucking cheaper and they&rsquo;re going to be a little bit</p>
<p>more invested in the result because they&rsquo;re still trying to learn and prove themselves</p>
<p>and they need the money most of the time versus a big business.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re just going to take your money and then they don&rsquo;t give a fuck.</p>
<p>They want the invoice paid and then once they give you something, they don&rsquo;t care if</p>
<p>it fails or fucking does good.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re literally only concern is the invoice and they don&rsquo;t give a fuck.</p>
<p>Their concern is making more money and if they can charge you again and fuck you, they</p>
<p>will.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re dealing with with a bigger company.</p>
<p>So find students, find people you can hire, find people that are cheaper, okay?</p>
<p>Like they&rsquo;re going to care a lot more and just trust me on that.</p>
<p>I had someone give me that advice of hire a student to develop my app and I considered</p>
<p>it, but I just didn&rsquo;t feel like I was good.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t feel confident in it.</p>
<p>Like I didn&rsquo;t think it was like a good idea until I saw how fucking poor of a job this</p>
<p>giant company like did.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that they were bad, but like the experience of it, shit, literally what the</p>
<p>fuck?</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s basic as my app is.</p>
<p>Oh my God.</p>
<p>I had one of my friends that I was like one of my party friends who was an app developer.</p>
<p>I had two, but each of them said they could do it for me or from like three to $5,000</p>
<p>and it should take like a month max with all the other work that they&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>But I did not feel confident when I saw these people behave.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t take shit serious.</p>
<p>They were not business oriented.</p>
<p>They did not keep their word.</p>
<p>They would talk a lot of shit and not follow through with it.</p>
<p>And I was also in a smaller town in Pensacola, Florida when I was starting my app and I wanted</p>
<p>someone that I could see face to face.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where I&rsquo;m going to get into where my trust issues kind of fucked me.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I just realized I&rsquo;ve had this fucking laptop stand sitting here this whole time.</p>
<p>Oh my God.</p>
<p>Ugly.</p>
<p>And I just had to plug my laptop in.</p>
<p>So now we got a cord.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re a mess today, but who gives a shit?</p>
<p>So I wanted someone that I could see face to face because if anything went wrong, if</p>
<p>they tried to fuck me, I wanted to be able to get my hands on them.</p>
<p>And I made that very clear.</p>
<p>But my biggest thing was trying to find people in my area.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t fucking waste your time.</p>
<p>Literally you can work with fucking anybody.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t be like me.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t be too paranoid because it&rsquo;ll probably bite you in the ass like it did me.</p>
<p>But when I started working with this big company, they were like in this bougie ass bank.</p>
<p>They were at the top floor.</p>
<p>And when I went to our first meeting with the owner, I was like meeting with the whole</p>
<p>team and I was like, okay, just to be clear, you know who you&rsquo;re dealing with.</p>
<p>I have these contracts.</p>
<p>Everything&rsquo;s in place.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>We all know about contracts.</p>
<p>But if you guys try and fuck me, I&rsquo;ll light this fucking building on fire.</p>
<p>And I just want y&rsquo;all to know, like I&rsquo;m very prepared for shit to go south and I have nothing</p>
<p>to fucking lose.</p>
<p>So like I was already suicidal at the point.</p>
<p>Like I was like, this app is the last little bit of fucking anything.</p>
<p>Like I&rsquo;m here to like make this app and kill myself was my fucking plan.</p>
<p>I was going to like make it, hope it like blew up and did something cool and then kill</p>
<p>myself so I could leave behind like something, you know?</p>
<p>But I literally was like, I have nothing to fucking lose and I will light y&rsquo;all shit</p>
<p>on fire.</p>
<p>Like you can play with me in business, but I want you to be aware of who you&rsquo;re going</p>
<p>to play with.</p>
<p>So you think smart.</p>
<p>You think twice.</p>
<p>And I instilled a little fear into them and I was dead ass fucking serious.</p>
<p>And all of them were scared.</p>
<p>And that was the relationship we had and I was taken very serious.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t recommend doing this.</p>
<p>I would not do that again.</p>
<p>Like just let them find out.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t warn someone if you&rsquo;re going to attack them or fuck them up.</p>
<p>Just fucking do it.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t talk about it.</p>
<p>Just be prepared.</p>
<p>Catch them off guard if you&rsquo;re going to do that.</p>
<p>Anyway, my whole thing with that was trying to hire a company.</p>
<p>Let that be your last option.</p>
<p>Let that be your last fucking option because it will save you probably like five times</p>
<p>the amount versus hiring a student, maybe even 10 times, honestly.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re going to get a lot better results and a lot better work ethic from the student.</p>
<p>Trust.</p>
<p>Trust.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So now I want to talk about advertising, bitch.</p>
<p>Learn advertising before you put money into it.</p>
<p>Literally read as many books as you can, take some courses, do everything that you can to</p>
<p>learn about advertising, ads, sales, everything about that before you start dumping money</p>
<p>into it.</p>
<p>Because I&rsquo;ve wasted a few thousand dollars on Facebook ads.</p>
<p>I thought it&rsquo;s easy.</p>
<p>I thought you just log in and fucking put some money in and you just put some keywords</p>
<p>and boom, it&rsquo;s done and you make a million dollars.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the reason people charge so much fucking money to run their Facebook ads.</p>
<p>Just learn as much as you can first.</p>
<p>Hire someone if you have to, but you&rsquo;re capable of a lot more than you think and you can learn</p>
<p>a lot more than you fucking think before you hire someone.</p>
<p>But just remember me saying before you pay to advertise, learn everything you fucking</p>
<p>can because that&rsquo;s money you can&rsquo;t get back.</p>
<p>You will learn a lot of lessons.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll learn a lot of what not to do, but if you&rsquo;re starting a business and you&rsquo;re tight</p>
<p>on funds, don&rsquo;t dump money into something that you don&rsquo;t fucking know about.</p>
<p>Just trust me.</p>
<p>Oh my God.</p>
<p>I could have bought a few bags with the amount that I fucking lost on Facebook.</p>
<p>And the next thing with that is get clear on your target audience.</p>
<p>Like okay, I want to help people.</p>
<p>A lot of people say that.</p>
<p>Who?</p>
<p>Get clear on who?</p>
<p>Get clear on your target audience, your target person that you&rsquo;re trying to sell something</p>
<p>to or the person you&rsquo;re trying to help.</p>
<p>Who would benefit from what you have to offer?</p>
<p>Be very clear on your target audience.</p>
<p>And one of the best books, because I&rsquo;m talking about learn as much as you can, I&rsquo;ve read</p>
<p>a lot of books on this shit and I&rsquo;ve taken a few courses.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to talk about people&rsquo;s courses that have been shitty, but a lot of them are</p>
<p>fucking shitty.</p>
<p>But one of the best books that I&rsquo;ve ever fucking found is a hundred million dollar offers by</p>
<p>Alex Ramosi.</p>
<p>I have two physical copies of the book.</p>
<p>I have a hardback, a paperback, and they&rsquo;re each like 22, 23 bucks.</p>
<p>They should be a thousand fucking dollars each as good as they are.</p>
<p>But they also have a digital download version that&rsquo;s 99 cents.</p>
<p>None of this is sponsored.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just telling you straight the fuck up.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one of the books that shifted everything in my brain, got me comfortable with sales</p>
<p>and wrapped it all up in one pretty nice little fucking book.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>The next thing I want to warn you for is get prepared for your life and everything in it</p>
<p>to come second.</p>
<p>Your business is its own thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s its own entity.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s its own everything.</p>
<p>And prepare for your life to come second.</p>
<p>And my example with this, and a couple of tips I have that are going to come out in</p>
<p>this story, my mom was like deathly fucking ill and I had to rush her to the emergency</p>
<p>room one day and I had a call scheduled with my app development team and I was in the middle</p>
<p>of the ER and I made sure my mom was okay.</p>
<p>Made sure she was all good, stable, she was fine.</p>
<p>I told her I was going to go outside and I went and I sat in the car and I had my fucking</p>
<p>business conference in the car while my mom was in the hospital, sick as fuck, throwing</p>
<p>up about to die.</p>
<p>Not really.</p>
<p>But it was bad.</p>
<p>Like I was so emotional and like worried and concerned, but I had to switch it off, get</p>
<p>into business mode and do my fucking conference.</p>
<p>I could have easily rescheduled, but I don&rsquo;t like to fuck around with a whole team like</p>
<p>that.</p>
<p>Like waste everybody&rsquo;s time.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like that shit.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not one of my values, my character traits.</p>
<p>Like I respect everyone&rsquo;s time.</p>
<p>I expect mine to be respected.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m going to give you the same courtesy.</p>
<p>I went my ass outside, got in the car and had my conference call on zoom in the fucking</p>
<p>car.</p>
<p>I told the team what was happening, but I showed I was committed to my business and</p>
<p>having the fucking call and we had it.</p>
<p>And the other thing I&rsquo;m going to say with that is be prepared to speak, present, talk,</p>
<p>recall things with nothing.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t have a notebook.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t have my laptop.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t have anything.</p>
<p>And I still had to navigate that entire fucking meeting.</p>
<p>And you need to be able to do this if you&rsquo;re going to have a business.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t rely on your fucking little notebook and your computer and your fucking little</p>
<p>presentation.</p>
<p>Like you have to be able to speak, be efficient, be strategic and be organized with no resources.</p>
<p>You have your brain in your mouth, figure it the fuck out.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s going to take time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to take practice, but there&rsquo;s so many skills and like character development</p>
<p>things that need to happen for you to be able to run a business.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s very serious and that&rsquo;s a huge thing that will help you.</p>
<p>You have to be able to adapt.</p>
<p>You have to be able to control your emotions to a point you can switch them off.</p>
<p>Like when I was walking out of the hospital, I had to switch them off.</p>
<p>Like I had to go from panicked and upset and worried to get your fucking ass in business</p>
<p>mode, stand the fuck up and lead this fucking conference.</p>
<p>Like so I did.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s something that a lot of people struggle with.</p>
<p>If you can&rsquo;t separate your emotions and what needs to be done, you&rsquo;re not going to make it.</p>
<p>Alright, I&rsquo;ve got a couple other tidbits of like information I want to throw at you.</p>
<p>So the biggest thing with productivity is setting limits on yourself and constraints</p>
<p>to get shit done.</p>
<p>And when you set a limit for yourself, it&rsquo;s not up for discussion.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s to be taken serious and you get your ass on it.</p>
<p>You do it.</p>
<p>Anytime I&rsquo;ve started something new or created something, switched my business around, anything</p>
<p>like that, I gave myself a time frame.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like, oh, I could do this probably in like two weeks.</p>
<p>Nah, I want it done by the weekend.</p>
<p>I give myself such tight constraints.</p>
<p>I will be so fucking stressed out.</p>
<p>So worried.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how I&rsquo;m going to do it.</p>
<p>Ah, like I&rsquo;m going to have to neglect other areas of my life.</p>
<p>But you know what happens when you set a time constraint, you squirm and you get it the</p>
<p>fuck done.</p>
<p>And even if you don&rsquo;t get it all done, you get so much more done than you thought.</p>
<p>I do have a whole podcast episode about motivation, discipline, productivity.</p>
<p>Those are three different episodes.</p>
<p>You can go listen to them.</p>
<p>But you can accomplish a lot more than you think in a short amount of time.</p>
<p>You just have to put that cap on yourself and make yourself squirm.</p>
<p>You need to give yourself that stress of a time cap.</p>
<p>And the time cap is to be respected.</p>
<p>Like I said, your business is your own separate thing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not you you&rsquo;re letting down.</p>
<p>You need to look at it like it&rsquo;s its own separate entity because it is.</p>
<p>And when you make a promise to that, you fucking fulfill it.</p>
<p>You hold up to it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not you that&rsquo;s suffering.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s your business that&rsquo;s going to suffer.</p>
<p>So get your shit together.</p>
<p>Okay, the next piece of advice I have is take responsibility for everything.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care what the situation is, what the circumstance is.</p>
<p>Everything is your fault.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re starting a business or you have a business.</p>
<p>Every single thing is your fault.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care who, what, when, where, why fucked up.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s your fault.</p>
<p>You have to go in it with that mindset because you own the business.</p>
<p>If something goes wrong in the business, who deals with the consequences?</p>
<p>You.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no one else to deal with it.</p>
<p>No one is going to help you, especially if you run something on your own like I do.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no one to blame.</p>
<p>And even if there is someone to blame, cool, you blamed them.</p>
<p>But who&rsquo;s dealing with the consequences?</p>
<p>You bitch.</p>
<p>You have to take responsibility for everything because you&rsquo;re the one that has the consequences.</p>
<p>Who gives a fuck whose fault it is?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s yours.</p>
<p>Now, there&rsquo;s a couple of questions that I ask myself when things go wrong.</p>
<p>If I like hire a team or like I&rsquo;m working with someone on something.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a couple of questions I ask myself when things go wrong or I have situations</p>
<p>like fuck up with my businesses.</p>
<p>So the first one is, what do I know now?</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;ll pull you out of like focusing on what&rsquo;s happened and pull you into the moment.</p>
<p>Okay, what do I know now?</p>
<p>At this given point in time, it puts you back in reality, like right here, right now in</p>
<p>the present.</p>
<p>You reflect on what you&rsquo;ve learned and then get clear on how this situation can be prevented</p>
<p>in the future.</p>
<p>What can I do to prevent this in the future?</p>
<p>Not what can so-and-so do that lets you down.</p>
<p>What can I do to prevent this in the future?</p>
<p>Like I said, everything is your fault.</p>
<p>Everything is your responsibility.</p>
<p>Take that shit.</p>
<p>If you can&rsquo;t handle that responsibility, if you can&rsquo;t handle that pressure, don&rsquo;t start</p>
<p>a business.</p>
<p>But getting clear on what you know now and how you&rsquo;re going to prevent this in the future</p>
<p>will make you feel a lot better about the situation and you&rsquo;ll feel a lot more prepared</p>
<p>and less scared because you have a way to solve this from happening again.</p>
<p>You won&rsquo;t have to worry about it anymore.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll just be something that happened.</p>
<p>You got through it.</p>
<p>You learned and it&rsquo;s not happening again.</p>
<p>And these are the moments where you learn so much.</p>
<p>Business is a lousy fucking teacher.</p>
<p>When you fail and when things fuck up is when you learn the skills, the ideas, the perspectives,</p>
<p>the thought processes, and resources.</p>
<p>These are the times where you can connect to different resources you didn&rsquo;t know that</p>
<p>you had to help you handle shit.</p>
<p>Like, oh my god, it&rsquo;s the best thing.</p>
<p>When things fuck up and go wrong, they suck, sure, but that&rsquo;s where the growth is.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where everything that you need that&rsquo;s going to propel you forward is going to come</p>
<p>from.</p>
<p>So get clear on those moments, what you learned.</p>
<p>What do I know now?</p>
<p>Okay, so the next thing I want to talk about is something that a lot of people post and</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s that your new life will cost you your old one.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s very true.</p>
<p>When you have a desire for something or do you want to change something about your life</p>
<p>or start something new, whatever it is, your new life and your new thing that you want,</p>
<p>your new reality is going to cost you your current one.</p>
<p>And what people don&rsquo;t tell you about that is the next version of you who can handle</p>
<p>the reality you want and the next version of you who is experiencing what it is that</p>
<p>you want is going to cost you who you are now.</p>
<p>And that is where you&rsquo;re going to get fucked up.</p>
<p>Like building a business, you&rsquo;re building yourself too.</p>
<p>Because when you start a business, every single insecurity you have will flare up.</p>
<p>Everything you&rsquo;re worried about, every fear, every quirk, everything wrong with you will</p>
<p>come up and you have to face it.</p>
<p>Like it&rsquo;s going to break you the fuck down because you&rsquo;re meant to rebuild yourself.</p>
<p>And you have to rebuild yourself into the person who can build a business.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not just building a business, you&rsquo;re building yourself with it.</p>
<p>And when you lose your current life, you lose your current self too.</p>
<p>Because everything you face, every challenge you go through, it&rsquo;s breaking down who you</p>
<p>are.</p>
<p>This is a very painful thing to go through and it&rsquo;s very disorienting and confusing and</p>
<p>scary as fuck.</p>
<p>And I can do a whole podcast episode about it.</p>
<p>But just remember me saying, your entire reality is going to break.</p>
<p>Who you are now has to break to get to where you want to get to.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just the way it fucking goes.</p>
<p>So get prepared for a lot of uncomfortable shit.</p>
<p>And like I&rsquo;ve said before in other episodes, commit to figuring it out and you will.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t look for a way out, look for a way through.</p>
<p>You got it.</p>
<p>Okay, so our last talking point for this video is about how to know if you should start a</p>
<p>business or not.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m going to tell you a couple things.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not meaning to hurt your feelings.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just telling you from someone who sees what it takes and does what it takes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like if you can&rsquo;t even just do these couple of things, you ain&rsquo;t ready for the</p>
<p>big shit of actually owning a business.</p>
<p>So if you can&rsquo;t make yourself do the small shit, don&rsquo;t start a business.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have what it takes.</p>
<p>If you need motivation to do basic little bullshit and daily tasks, don&rsquo;t even fucking</p>
<p>bother.</p>
<p>Literally, it&rsquo;s going to be too much and too overwhelming.</p>
<p>If you constantly rely on motivation and you can&rsquo;t just be disciplined and fucking do what</p>
<p>needs to be done, give it up.</p>
<p>Go get a normal job.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re there for.</p>
<p>And the other thing is uncertainty.</p>
<p>You have to get very, very comfortable with living in uncertainty.</p>
<p>Nothing is guaranteed when you start your own business.</p>
<p>The way that society is set up is school, get a job.</p>
<p>Okay, you go to college, you get a degree, you go get a job and going to college guarantees</p>
<p>you you&rsquo;re going to get that job because you get your little piece of paper, you get your</p>
<p>little degree.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the safe route.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the route with stability.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the route with certainty.</p>
<p>There is no certainty.</p>
<p>There is no stability in creating your own business or starting anything on your fucking</p>
<p>own.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s going to fucking work.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re not willing to choose into a life that is shaky for a while until you can</p>
<p>create that stability for yourself, don&rsquo;t even bother.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s enough to break a lot of people.</p>
<p>And entrepreneurship and starting businesses is not for everyone.</p>
<p>Not everyone&rsquo;s cut out for it.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m saying.</p>
<p>Like if you have to go work a normal job, that&rsquo;s totally fine.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to do it.</p>
<p>Like that&rsquo;s what makes the world go round.</p>
<p>And even if you have to go work a job while you&rsquo;re starting your business so you still</p>
<p>feel a sense of stability and like you&rsquo;re okay, you&rsquo;re not like fully in fight or flight</p>
<p>mode every day like I fucking was.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s understandable too.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m not talking down on you for any of that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just saying if you can&rsquo;t make yourself just do the small shit, if you aren&rsquo;t okay</p>
<p>with uncertainty, if you can&rsquo;t manage your emotions, if you&rsquo;re not okay with doing bitch</p>
<p>work, go experience more.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t even entertain the idea of starting a business.</p>
<p>You need to go experience more things until you develop these skills to start the business</p>
<p>if that&rsquo;s something that you want to do.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not ready for it yet.</p>
<p>And like I said before, you can just jump into it like the ocean.</p>
<p>Like I was talking about with the kiddie pool in the ocean.</p>
<p>You can just go jump in the fucking ocean and figure it out.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be a lot harder if you&rsquo;re not disciplined.</p>
<p>So go do some shit to learn some discipline.</p>
<p>But you can figure it out.</p>
<p>You absolutely can.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not doubting you.</p>
<p>You just got to make sure you are one stubborn motherfucker and you&rsquo;re going to make it work</p>
<p>because it&rsquo;s going to get bad.</p>
<p>And your head ain&rsquo;t going to come up out of water for a long time.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to think you&rsquo;re fucking drowning.</p>
<p>One thing people don&rsquo;t talk about when they start their own businesses is how they constantly</p>
<p>are daydreaming about going back to a nine to five because that&rsquo;s something I did for</p>
<p>a while.</p>
<p>I would always do when things got hard or I stressed out or things just got really difficult,</p>
<p>I would just think back to going to a certain like job like you get structure, you get stability,</p>
<p>you get routine, you get all of that.</p>
<p>You get a clear, definite work this amount of hours and you clock out when you have your</p>
<p>own business.</p>
<p>Ain&rsquo;t no clock out, babe.</p>
<p>Sorry.</p>
<p>Put your seatbelt on because you&rsquo;re going to fucking eat, breathe and sleep your business</p>
<p>or good luck.</p>
<p>A lot of people think nine to fives are more work.</p>
<p>Absolutely the fuck not.</p>
<p>Oh my God.</p>
<p>But my whole thing with saying you&rsquo;re going to entertain the idea and you&rsquo;re going to</p>
<p>consider going back to a nine to five when you&rsquo;re thinking about going back to a nine</p>
<p>to five and it feels like relief.</p>
<p>Pay attention to what you&rsquo;re feeling.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re feeling unstable.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re feeling uncertain.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re feeling overwhelmed.</p>
<p>You feel hopeless.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of things that you&rsquo;re feeling if you&rsquo;re dealing with your own business that</p>
<p>are going to cause you to entertain that thought.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like my episode about missing people.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not missing the job.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t actually want that job.</p>
<p>You miss the way you feel inside it.</p>
<p>So your brain is just going to remember the last time you felt stable, consistent, secure,</p>
<p>all of that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to make you think you missed that job.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to make you think you want a normal job again, but it&rsquo;s not a normal job that</p>
<p>you want.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s to feel safe.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s to feel secure.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s to feel stable.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s to want a sense of routine.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s to feel like your actions are for something because in a business for a long time, you&rsquo;re</p>
<p>going to be doing a lot of shit and a lot of bitch work when you see no results.</p>
<p>You see nothing.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no ROI on it for a long time.</p>
<p>And when you are constantly exhausted by that, your brain&rsquo;s automatically going to start</p>
<p>thinking back to it.</p>
<p>So I just want to give you this reassurance.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t actually want a nine to five.</p>
<p>You want the feeling states that are in that.</p>
<p>So once you know the way that you want to feel, figure out a way to set that up in your</p>
<p>business.</p>
<p>Even if it takes time, you can start doing things now that will make you feel more stable,</p>
<p>secure, consistent, all these things, less fearful.</p>
<p>You can set things up, but you just have to get clear on what it is you feel and what</p>
<p>you need to set up in your own life.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s also set up in a nine to five that gives you those feelings.</p>
<p>So I am officially done yelling at you.</p>
<p>This, like I said, was everything I wish someone would have slapped me upside the head</p>
<p>with before I started a business.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t mean to offend anybody if I did, but if you&rsquo;re too weak and you&rsquo;re like triggered</p>
<p>by this video, another sign you shouldn&rsquo;t start a fucking business.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s harsh, bitch.</p>
<p>But I have a lot more tricks up my sleeves.</p>
<p>Bad time to use that.</p>
<p>But I hope this video was helpful.</p>
<p>Leave me a comment down below of what you thought.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re watching this on YouTube, leave me a thumbs up.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re listening to the audio version of Aware and Aggravated on Spotify and Apple</p>
<p>Podcasts, if you didn&rsquo;t know, I have episode one through 40 that&rsquo;s just audio version.</p>
<p>So episode 40 and on is video.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re listening to it, leave me a five stars.</p>
<p>All of my links to everything that you can keep up with me on, everything I&rsquo;ve got is</p>
<p>all in the description.</p>
<p>If you want to download my app, Positive Focus, I just want to say thanks if you made it this</p>
<p>far.</p>
<p>Hope you enjoyed the video, even though I yelled at you the whole time.</p>
<p>Everybody stay safe, take care of yourself, and I will talk to you next Sunday.</p>
